[43:10] me this model
[43:13] flesh ages
[43:15] right I never believed I'll need
[43:19] glasses I was believing I'll be like my
[43:22] grandmom that did not need glasses and
[43:25] even in a night is thank you
[43:28] but well we use
[43:30] computers and uh that doesn't help us 2
[43:34] Peter chapter 1 uh I would read the
[43:37] first 12 verses I'll read as quickly as
[43:39] I can because it's a bit of a long
[43:41] read Simon Peter a servant and an
[43:44] apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[43:46] have obtained like Precious Faith with
[43:48] us through the righteousness of God and
[43:51] our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace
[43:54] be multiplied unto you through the
[43:55] knowledge knowled of God and of Jesus
[43:58] our lord according as his divine power
[44:01] given unto us all things that pertain
[44:04] unto life and godliness through the
[44:06] knowledge of him that had called us to
[44:08] glory and
[44:10] virtue whereby I given unto us exceeding
[44:13] great and precious promises that by this
[44:17] ye might be partakers of the divine
[44:19] nature having escaped the corruption
[44:22] that is in the world through lust and
[44:26] beside this giving all diligence add to
[44:29] your faith virtue and to Virtue

[44:35] and to Temperance patience and to
[44:37] patience godliness and to Godliness
[44:40] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[44:42] kindness
[44:43] charity for if these things be in you
[44:46] and abound they make you that ye shall
[44:48] neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the
[44:51] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[44:55] he that lath these things is blind and
[44:58] cannot see a far off and have forgotten
[45:01] that he was porched from his old Saints
[45:05] wherefore the rather Brethren give the
[45:07] allegiance to make your calling an
[45:09] election sure for if you do these things
[45:13] ye shall never fall for so an entrance
[45:17] shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[45:20] into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord
[45:22] and Savior Jesus Christ amen wherefore I
[45:25] will will not be negligent to put you
[45:28] always in remembrance of these things
[45:31] though you know them and be established
[45:33] in the present truth the Lord bless the
[45:36] reading of his word please be
[45:38] seated tonight I want to take a bit of
[45:41] an unusual topic believe the lord has
[45:43] laid in my
[45:44] heart and uh the title is do I have the
[45:48] Holy
[45:49] Ghost and I'll take for a subject make
[45:52] your calling and election
[45:54] sure and I believe the Lord laid this in
[45:57] my heart um a while ago so
[46:01] I um I was thinking when the pastor
[46:04] asked me to take the service tonight he
[46:06] came back to me as what the Lord wants
[46:08] us to speak about and uh that had
[46:12] happened um and I was at work I think it
[46:15] was the week before and Brother Kyle
[46:17] sent that uh that message private
[46:21] interview um on the WhatsApp group and I
[46:25] believe that was just Lord confirming
[46:26] that he wanted us to take a look at
[46:29] this now second Peter chap 1: 10 I'll
[46:33] just read the Amplified version here
[46:36] just to give us a context of some of the
[46:38] things I want to talk about tonight it
[46:40] says therefore Believers be all the more
[46:44] diligent to make certain about his
[46:47] calling and choosing you be sure that
[46:51] your behavior reflects and confirms your
[46:55] relationship with God for by doing those
[46:59] things actively depend developing those
[47:03] virtues you will never stumble in your
[47:06] spiritual growth and will live a life
[47:09] that leads others away from
[47:12] sin in the ministry of brother Braham
[47:15] there were a couple times that people
[47:17] had this question do I have the Holy
[47:20] Ghost and you know when people have
[47:23] those questions they actually I'll say
[47:25] they
[47:26] four possibilities and this is just
[47:28] ordinary logic I forgot the clicker in
[47:31] the room again
[47:32] sorry if I could get that so I don't
[47:35] have to tell the brothers next next all
[47:37] the time but if you can go to the next
[47:38] slide whilst I wait for
[47:40] that so there are people that they have
[47:43] the Holy Ghost and they know that they
[47:44] have the Holy
[47:46] Ghost and there are people that do not
[47:48] have the Holy
[47:49] Ghost but they think that they have the
[47:52] Holy Ghost that is a very thank you very
[47:55] much that's a very dangerous place to
[47:58] be there are also people that have the
[48:00] Holy Ghost but they think they don't
[48:03] have the Holy Ghost and that is where
[48:05] we'll focus on tonight because that is
[48:08] um that is exactly you know what what uh
[48:11] private interview was with sister
[48:13] Bruce and there are people that do not
[48:15] have the Holy Ghost and know that they
[48:17] don't and I hope like if there's anyone
[48:19] like that you're actually trus in the
[48:21] Lord to give you the Holy Ghost because
[48:23] it's a promise and God will never fail
[48:25] to his promise
[48:27] am so brother Braham um a few messages
[48:31] I'll just point us to tonight where
[48:33] brother Braham actually talked about
[48:34] this and there was another message which
[48:38] is titled Blasphemous names where
[48:41] brother Braham also spoke to another
[48:44] about another person that had the same
[48:46] question of whether she had the holy
[48:47] ghost or not and her name was Sister
[48:50] Shepherd now brother Braham I I just
[48:52] read second Peter chapter 1 and this was
[48:55] the text that brother Braham took when
[48:57] he preached the message the stature of a
[48:59] perfect man brother Braham preached that
[49:01] on the four the 14th of October
[49:04] 1962 in the morning and in the evening
[49:07] service he preached the message a
[49:10] guide and then um the thir the the 30th
[49:15] of October that's end of that month he
[49:17] preed the message vision from the Lord I
[49:19] think it was pretty much of a short
[49:20] message and then on 11th of November
[49:23] also
[49:24] 1962 he preached Blasphemous names now
[49:28] in all of the messages that brother
[49:29] Braham preached after the statue of a
[49:31] perfect man brother Braham referred to
[49:33] what he taught um in the stature of a
[49:36] perfect
[49:37] man now when people have I know our
[49:39] pastor is taken you know the this the
[49:42] Holy Ghost series which I'm really
[49:44] enjoying and and I believe it's going to
[49:46] answer a lot of
[49:48] questions and I believe that the Lord
[49:50] will set the fivefold in the church and
[49:54] give the ministry not the the man but
[49:56] the ministry uh uh a gift of discernment
[49:59] to discern the needs of the people and
[50:02] that's why I want to read Ephesians 47-6
[50:04] he said but unto every one of us is
[50:06] given Grace according to the measure of
[50:09] the gift of Christ wherefore he saith
[50:12] when he ascended upon high he led
[50:14] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[50:16] men said now that he ascended what is it
[50:20] but that he also descended first into
[50:23] the lower parts of the earth he that
[50:25] ascended is the same also that ascended
[50:28] up far above all Heavens that he might
[50:31] fill all things now he talking about
[50:34] Christ here now verse 11 said and he
[50:37] Christ gave some Apostles and some
[50:41] prophets and some evangelists and some
[50:43] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[50:48] of the Saints amen for the work of the
[50:51] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[50:55] Christ
[50:57] till we all come in the unity of the
[51:00] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[51:03] God unto a perfect man so God's goal is
[51:06] to bring us to a state of
[51:09] perfection unto the measure of the
[51:12] stature of the fullness of Christ and it
[51:16] didn't just say that to the fullness of
[51:18] Christ but a measure of the fullness of
[51:21] Christ because we cannot have all of
[51:23] Christ God bless you Sister Lily
[51:26] welcome
[51:27] back we cannot have all of
[51:30] Christ right we we cannot have the
[51:32] fullness of the goded in us like Christ
[51:35] did but we can have a portion of all of
[51:38] Christ am amen so we'll have all of his
[51:43] attributes but it will be a portion just
[51:45] like what AB Braham will describe you go
[51:47] into an O you go to the ocean you take a
[51:49] cup of water off of the ocean he said
[51:51] that cup of water has got all the
[51:53] elements that is in the water that is in
[51:56] the
[51:57] ocean but it's just a measure of it so
[51:59] that's why he saying it brings us into a
[52:01] measure of the stature of the fullness
[52:03] of Christ that we henceforth be no more
[52:07] children amen so there will be a time
[52:09] where we'll be
[52:11] children but the intention is not for us
[52:14] to remain as children am the intention
[52:17] is for us to
[52:18] grow and when we start to grow it helps
[52:22] us not to be tossed to and fr
[52:25] and carried about with every wind of
[52:28] Doctrine by the slide of men and conning
[52:31] craftiness why whereby they lie in way
[52:34] to the se but speaking the truth in love
[52:36] may grow up into him in all things which
[52:39] is the head even Christ from whom the
[52:42] old body fitly joins together and
[52:44] compacted by that which every joint
[52:47] Supply it according to the effectual
[52:48] working in the measure of every part
[52:51] maketh increase of the body unto the
[52:54] edifying of of itself in
[52:56] love so but told us in Blasphemous
[53:00] names he say since the shepherd here I
[53:02] have a lot of qutes to read that's why I
[53:04] put it on the slide so you can read
[53:05] along and we not we'll try not to make
[53:08] it boring tonight it's teaching service
[53:11] tonight not so much of preaching and and
[53:13] jumping around but uh brother Ram said
[53:15] that teaching does what it establishes
[53:17] the
[53:18] church sister Shepherd here and brother
[53:21] Shepherd who are very gracious friends
[53:22] of ours and who come to this Tabernacle
[53:26] and they are precious children of God
[53:28] and this sister Shepherd when I was
[53:30] speaking of my mail the kind of Billy
[53:32] can answer just somebody says send me so
[53:34] many prayer clotes and I pray over them
[53:36] he just answers them back but when it's
[53:38] an individual letter I have to answer it
[53:41] myself you see so I picked up my
[53:43] individual meil and so I was taking it
[53:47] home and I was reading in there it said
[53:49] from Sister Shepherd and it was a dream
[53:51] that she had had of some months ago and
[53:54] she'll never could get it just right
[53:56] until two or three Sundays ago when I
[53:59] taught on this seven Church ages and the
[54:02] Seven fruits second Peter I will take
[54:05] second Peter 1 to add to our faith see
[54:08] so was referring to the message the
[54:10] stature of your perfect man brother Ram
[54:12] went ahead to talk about the stature of
[54:13] a perfect man just give like a rundown
[54:16] of it I brought this so that we can see
[54:18] you know just a reminder of the
[54:20] picture now I'm going to maybe come back
[54:22] to this but if you look at this brother
[54:25] Braham taught about how God builds his
[54:29] individual and then Compares it with how
[54:32] God builds his
[54:34] church through the seven Church
[54:37] ages now I believe from my own
[54:40] understanding the fact that brother
[54:42] Braham brought it together kind of
[54:44] creates a confusion
[54:46] sometimes and if you go back and read
[54:48] that message you have to see where
[54:50] brother Braham took his time to focus on
[54:52] the growth of the individual and in
[54:55] transition to talk about how God has
[54:58] built his church over seven Church ages
[55:01] continually comparing
[55:04] it the reason I said that is if you take
[55:07] a look at
[55:08] this it appears that the individual will
[55:11] never receive the Holy Ghost until he
[55:14] has all those virtues except
[55:16] love but if you go back and read it
[55:19] that's not what brother Braham
[55:21] taught but when brother Braham was
[55:23] describing this trying to show how God
[55:25] built his church he placed that Holy
[55:28] Spirit there to show us that that's what
[55:31] brings the Capstone to the
[55:34] body so that that order applies when
[55:38] brother Bram was talking about the
[55:40] church but we'll find out tonight it
[55:42] doesn't apply when he was talking about
[55:43] the individual not exactly it applies
[55:46] but not
[55:47] exactly so said in 84 of that same
[55:51] message and now the reason I'm saying
[55:53] this that you might get an idea on what
[55:55] sister the sister dreamed so but brah
[55:57] was talking about the stature of a
[55:59] perfect man so that we can have an idea
[56:01] on what sister shepher Dre we don't have
[56:04] time tonight so I'm not going to get to
[56:05] Sister Shepherd's dream but I'm going to
[56:08] talk about how brother Braham
[56:10] explained um basically what the dream
[56:14] was about what the dream did to her to
[56:17] make her understand the statue of a
[56:18] perfect man but the said now the reason
[56:21] I'm saying this that you might get an
[56:22] idea on what the sister dreamed and
[56:25] dream is certainly comparison to what I
[56:28] been teaching now I believe that the
[56:32] reason that there is so much confusion
[56:34] today about the holy spirit it's not
[56:37] correctly taught this was in the time of
[56:39] brother Braham I'm not saying that it's
[56:40] not correctly taught now and you see why
[56:43] brother Braham said that I believe that
[56:44] the baptism is taught and just say the
[56:48] baptism but then be like you say
[56:52] automobile but now I've got several
[56:55] mechanics in this church and I don't
[56:57] know one thing about it so if I make a
[56:58] mistake Brethren remember I'm not a
[57:00] mechanic there has to be coils and plugs
[57:03] and points and valves and everything
[57:05] else that make the automobile and when
[57:08] you talk about the baptism of the Holy
[57:10] Spirit there is a lot goes with
[57:13] that there's a lot goes with that and
[57:16] here is what I think that God is proven
[57:18] the Holy Spirit here so now Peter said
[57:21] first Faith now watch it real close now
[57:24] we're going to te teach this for a few
[57:26] minutes sorry I should
[57:28] be okay sorry I'm not there
[57:31] yet yeah we're going to see this for a
[57:33] few minutes Faith now is your is now is
[57:38] your first and add to your faith virtue
[57:40] and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[57:42] Temperance and to Temperance patience to
[57:44] your patience godliness to Godliness
[57:46] Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and
[57:48] then love and anyone knows that love is
[57:51] God God is love see now and about
[57:54] grounding the so that you will see when
[57:56] the sister's dream is being told he said
[58:00] now this things here absolutely must be
[58:03] in the
[58:04] Christian before the holy ghost ever
[58:07] seals them before this comes down on top
[58:10] and makes a complete
[58:13] unit so if you read this in
[58:17] isolation you can come to a
[58:19] conclusion that if you don't have all
[58:21] the virtues then you cannot have the
[58:23] Holy Spirit
[58:25] but let's keep going so the first
[58:27] question I want to bring tonight is do I
[58:29] have to possess all those virtues just
[58:30] like I said before I'm sealed with the
[58:32] Holy Ghost or before I receive the Holy
[58:35] Ghost stature of a perfect man brother
[58:38] brah said so when you surrender your
[58:40] complete being then the Holy Spirit
[58:43] pours through you in these virtues then
[58:46] you are a living Tabernacle then people
[58:49] look and say that's a manful of virtue
[58:51] knowledge and beliefs the word
[58:52] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[58:54] kindness full of the love of the Holy
[58:56] Ghost see there he is walking around
[58:59] what is it a statue that unbelievers can
[59:02] look at and say there is a Christian
[59:05] there is a man or a woman who knows what
[59:07] they're talking about you never seen a
[59:10] kind of sweeter Godly person you are
[59:13] sealed now brother BR said they seal
[59:15] shows on both
[59:18] sides so I'm already given a background
[59:20] to this because the ceiling is on two
[59:24] sides
[59:25] is what brother is
[59:27] saying whether you're going or coming
[59:29] you see the seal just the same there you
[59:30] are when a man or a woman possesses this
[59:34] then the Capstone comes down and seals
[59:37] them into the kingdom of God which is
[59:41] the Holy
[59:43] Ghost then the word keep following
[59:45] Brother Bram then the word coming from
[59:48] here sorry yeah okay you're helping me
[59:52] thank you I was get getting
[59:55] confused then the word coming from here
[59:57] manifests itself through each one of
[59:59] this beings see and makes this complete
[1:00:01] being of Tabernacle of the Living God a
[1:00:03] walking living example of Christianity
[1:00:06] what Christ words those people are
[1:00:08] because his life is in here they are in
[1:00:10] Christ and their life is dead and hid in
[1:00:13] Christ through God and sealed in there
[1:00:15] by the Holy Ghost 1 Corinthians 12
[1:00:17] that's right see you reckon yourself
[1:00:20] dead and you are born of Faith then
[1:00:22] virtue and these other things is that to
[1:00:25] you till you are a perfect living image
[1:00:29] of God that's wonderful so brother brah
[1:00:32] tells us that the virtues are built but
[1:00:35] there's something that happens that
[1:00:37] seals at the end but first a sealing
[1:00:40] happens because as we've read brother
[1:00:42] Barry reminded us just a few sunds ago
[1:00:45] when he was talking about what the Holy
[1:00:46] Ghost is brother Braham said the Holy
[1:00:48] Ghost is a
[1:00:49] seal so when you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:00:52] you are receiving the Seal of God and
[1:00:54] brother also quoted Ephesians 4 there 30
[1:00:57] that said that when you are sealed you
[1:00:59] are sealed until the day of your
[1:01:01] Redemption so nothing can stop that
[1:01:05] nothing can change
[1:01:07] it now the next question is the baptism
[1:01:10] of the Holy Ghost a single
[1:01:13] event and if we have this answer I think
[1:01:16] it will help us to start to you know get
[1:01:19] to understand when we get to those
[1:01:21] points and you are thinking you don't
[1:01:23] have the Holy Ghost
[1:01:25] you will start to see answers why what
[1:01:28] is going on is going on why it is the
[1:01:30] way it is and you be able to give
[1:01:33] yourself the right answer based on what
[1:01:35] the word of God
[1:01:36] says now brother brah said in you must
[1:01:39] be born again and now I'm saying this I
[1:01:42] know he going on tape and I want to say
[1:01:44] this to the pastors that will perhaps
[1:01:46] receive this tape I suppose maybe just a
[1:01:49] little different from what the regular
[1:01:51] Church
[1:01:52] teaches I teach and believe and believe
[1:01:57] can sufficiently prove by the
[1:02:00] scripture that you are born of the
[1:02:03] spirit and then baptized into the body
[1:02:08] by the Holy Spirit but brah will always
[1:02:10] say and is a
[1:02:12] conjunction so it's not a single event
[1:02:14] you don't just get born again and you
[1:02:16] are
[1:02:18] perfect if you go and listen to
[1:02:20] Blasphemous names I don't have the time
[1:02:21] but brah was talking about a certain
[1:02:23] Doctrine
[1:02:24] where he said people will come and they
[1:02:27] tell them if you can come and we pray
[1:02:29] for you you receive the Holy Ghost you
[1:02:31] immediately become manifested sons of
[1:02:34] God it was a Doctrine in the time of
[1:02:36] brother Braham so and brother Braham was
[1:02:39] explaining that they see their lives is
[1:02:41] not measuring up to that Perfection that
[1:02:43] we are talking about but they
[1:02:45] continually say they are manifested sons
[1:02:48] of God and we know that if the sons of
[1:02:50] God are all manifested then the old
[1:02:53] creature that that is crying They will
[1:02:55] receive their Redemption because that's
[1:02:57] what they're waiting
[1:02:59] for Brother brah now
[1:03:02] said said now many of them see that that
[1:03:05] just to come up and be recognized before
[1:03:08] the congregation and so forth as a
[1:03:10] sinner that you want to accept Christ as
[1:03:12] personal savior that is the new birth so
[1:03:15] if you go to like Pentecostal churches
[1:03:18] today they will say if you want to give
[1:03:19] your life to Christ and then they'll
[1:03:20] bring you you say after them and after
[1:03:23] you say that they say you're born
[1:03:26] again how many have heard that before I
[1:03:29] know brother Marin used to be in
[1:03:30] Pentecost and sister f but I was as well
[1:03:34] I was born on the message but I mean I
[1:03:36] went out there and that's what they do
[1:03:38] they just kind of force you to speak in
[1:03:40] tongues and then once you speak in
[1:03:41] tongues they said you born but it's
[1:03:44] right happening that right that same day
[1:03:46] when they asking you to give your life
[1:03:47] to Christ now brother Braham is saying
[1:03:49] that receiving Jesus as your personal
[1:03:52] savior is not the new birth
[1:03:56] many believe that water baptism is a new
[1:03:58] birth and some of them believe that
[1:03:59] you're born of the water when you're
[1:04:01] baptized in the water there are so many
[1:04:04] different versions of it lot of them
[1:04:06] many believe that to recite a Creed and
[1:04:08] Believe on a doctrine of a church just
[1:04:09] accepted say I believe the holy church
[1:04:11] and so and so and believe God to be the
[1:04:14] savior of man and so forth and from this
[1:04:16] day on I become a member of this church
[1:04:18] and fellowship with the Christians they
[1:04:19] believe that to be born again and
[1:04:22] although the Creed that the recite and
[1:04:24] don't I don't believe we could criticize
[1:04:26] it some of them are pure and holy some
[1:04:28] of them are real scriptural but the
[1:04:30] scripture is not applied on the right
[1:04:31] list and even applying the scripture I
[1:04:34] believe that the new birth is something
[1:04:36] beyond that even though how well you
[1:04:39] might mean it I believe something that
[1:04:42] the new birth is far beyond your good
[1:04:44] intentions and your thoughts Minds is
[1:04:48] beyond that somewhere else said it's an
[1:04:50] experience it's a birath and it's mercy
[1:04:53] and we're going to go back back to you
[1:04:54] know the the interview with s Bruce
[1:04:56] because he asked s Bruce specific
[1:05:00] questions Blasphemous names he said now
[1:05:03] when the member is born by the Holy
[1:05:05] Ghost into the family of God remember he
[1:05:08] said when the member is done has done
[1:05:11] what has been born by the Holy Ghost
[1:05:12] into the family of God and has proven to
[1:05:15] have those virtues in him so there
[1:05:17] there's not it's not a single event
[1:05:19] you're born then you have to build the
[1:05:22] virtues just as we read Paul Peter said
[1:05:24] you've got to grow up into
[1:05:28] him so when you there are times you
[1:05:31] stumble and why are we bringing this
[1:05:33] tonight because if you have the Holy
[1:05:35] Ghost and you think you don't have the
[1:05:37] Holy Ghost you will still make the
[1:05:39] Rapture for sure but you're going to
[1:05:41] live an underprivileged
[1:05:43] life the enemy will continue to make you
[1:05:46] live be um sorry below your privileges
[1:05:50] because it's going to you're going to be
[1:05:52] dealing with guilt and that's exactly
[1:05:54] what happened to Sister
[1:05:57] Bruce now when a member is born by the
[1:05:59] Holy Ghost into the family of God and
[1:06:01] has proven to have those virtues in him
[1:06:03] that God can see virtue knowledge
[1:06:06] Temperance patience brotherly kindness
[1:06:08] godliness in him then God seals him or
[1:06:12] places
[1:06:13] him now that's something that we need to
[1:06:16] ponder over just a little bit because
[1:06:19] brother Braham took time to teach what
[1:06:20] we call the adoption series which he
[1:06:23] also titled the placing of
[1:06:27] sons I don't want to go ahead of myself
[1:06:29] cuz I read brother brah to us how we
[1:06:31] doing with
[1:06:32] time
[1:06:34] um places him and there that's where you
[1:06:37] see the Sons and Daughters of God I want
[1:06:39] to believe AB Braham was referring to
[1:06:41] the manifested Sons and Daughters of God
[1:06:44] after they are placed then Ephesians
[1:06:46] 4:30 says grieve not the Holy Ghost
[1:06:48] whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
[1:06:50] redemption now some of you Baptist that
[1:06:52] want to go on eternal security now if
[1:06:54] you'll come to that stage I'll stand
[1:06:57] with you what brother R is saying here
[1:06:59] is you can't say someone comes to the
[1:07:01] altar receives Christ as their savior
[1:07:03] speaks in tongues and that's eternal
[1:07:05] security but if you tell me that someone
[1:07:08] has received the Holy Ghost and goes on
[1:07:10] to allow the Holy Ghost to build those
[1:07:12] virtues in them and they come to a place
[1:07:15] of placing adoption and you want to call
[1:07:18] that eternal security I agree with you
[1:07:22] amen he
[1:07:25] said but just to say that any just to
[1:07:28] say anybody says I've joined the Baptist
[1:07:31] Church I'm a presbyterian I got eternal
[1:07:33] security said that's wrong your own life
[1:07:36] proves you haven't got
[1:07:38] it so they are part of the church but
[1:07:41] their life denies the word until this is
[1:07:45] there what is there that thing that he
[1:07:48] showed to us and God has adopted you and
[1:07:52] sealed you by the Holy Ghost into his
[1:07:54] kingdom then there is no getting out of
[1:07:57] it you are eternally secure believe
[1:07:59] grieve not the holy spirit whereby all
[1:08:01] you and your Godly virtues I love that
[1:08:05] are sealed until the day of
[1:08:07] redemption now Blasphemous names again
[1:08:10] he
[1:08:12] said have you have you heard he ye him
[1:08:15] the samon I just hear about about a year
[1:08:17] ago preach become so popular hear ye him
[1:08:21] the placing of a son is referring to
[1:08:23] that again in Ephesians 1:5 also God has
[1:08:26] predestinated us unto adoption of sons
[1:08:30] he says see a family when a son is born
[1:08:33] into it it's a son
[1:08:36] then but that son had tutors to raise it
[1:08:40] and if that son never did come to be the
[1:08:43] right kind of a son he never become
[1:08:48] her but if it was the right son and the
[1:08:51] son that will obey his father then that
[1:08:54] son was adopted or placed positionally
[1:08:57] he become hair of what the father had
[1:09:01] but Abraham was given this in the
[1:09:04] natural now the difference between what
[1:09:07] he said here because someone might look
[1:09:09] at it and said he said oh you know if
[1:09:11] that son never was the right kind of son
[1:09:14] then he will not become the for the
[1:09:15] father would never become adopted in the
[1:09:17] natural that is true but in the
[1:09:20] spiritual when you are born again when
[1:09:23] when you receive the Holy Ghost when
[1:09:25] you're born as a child God said it is
[1:09:28] the until the day of your Redemption
[1:09:30] amen now brother also told us that if
[1:09:33] that child of God will ever disobey
[1:09:37] God's word and not repent after God
[1:09:40] corrects him he said rather than God
[1:09:42] lose him God will take him off the
[1:09:46] sin that is eternal
[1:09:49] security that is that is the that's the
[1:09:52] reason why we say receive the Holy Ghost
[1:09:54] because once you cross in there you are
[1:09:56] eternally safe you are eternally
[1:10:01] secure the question we're trying to
[1:10:03] answer which is the second
[1:10:07] question is that is the baptism of the
[1:10:10] Holy Ghost a single
[1:10:13] event now I also said that Braham
[1:10:17] explained and I don't have all the time
[1:10:18] but if you read stature of a perfect man
[1:10:21] you'll see how the Braham talked about
[1:10:23] being born as babes and needing to
[1:10:27] grow now in Divine Healing
[1:10:32] 1954 this is a bit of a long read but
[1:10:35] let's just because I like the way
[1:10:37] brother BR described something here that
[1:10:39] we might relate to he said now you
[1:10:42] notice those people they can sit and say
[1:10:44] well I accept the Lord you take their
[1:10:47] word for it I would to I can't judge God
[1:10:50] does but in 10 years from now they've
[1:10:53] never Pro progressed a bit just staying
[1:10:56] right in the same old
[1:10:58] place say see we grow daily each day our
[1:11:03] heart hungers keeps moving on there is
[1:11:07] something growing inside of you you get
[1:11:10] bigger spread out can take more am we
[1:11:16] come to a better understanding of the
[1:11:20] word there's some things that maybe as a
[1:11:22] baby you couldn't take
[1:11:26] there are Corrections that Christ will
[1:11:27] bring and you will like no I still want
[1:11:30] to hold on to
[1:11:33] this maybe it's a bad
[1:11:35] attitude it doesn't mean you're not
[1:11:37] filled with the Holy
[1:11:43] Ghost but as you grow
[1:11:45] older as you have more experiences with
[1:11:49] God you start to open up your heart to
[1:11:52] receive more from him more instruction
[1:11:55] that is
[1:11:56] growth he said Paul said told the
[1:11:59] Corinthian Church you're mature in
[1:12:00] growing but when you ought to be
[1:12:02] teachers you're still babes needing
[1:12:05] teaching is that right when you ought to
[1:12:07] be teachers something in there growing
[1:12:09] out pushing out making bigger the Holy
[1:12:13] Spirit growing said the new birth
[1:12:17] brother ask a question if a birth is
[1:12:18] born from the outside from the inside
[1:12:21] out which is a natural birth the child
[1:12:24] it grows if it leaves if it doesn't it
[1:12:28] remains is that right well when a birth
[1:12:30] is on the inside shouldn't It Grow the
[1:12:33] Christ in your heart ought to be growing
[1:12:35] daily getting bigger more powerful
[1:12:38] understanding things better
[1:12:41] forgiven walking on as God would till
[1:12:44] Christ be formed in you the hope of
[1:12:48] glory it's a growth process that takes
[1:12:50] us to a state where it becomes easier
[1:12:53] for us to
[1:12:54] forgive yes you might have received the
[1:12:57] Holy Ghost but some things are just hard
[1:13:00] for you to forgive people of because of
[1:13:02] how much it hurts
[1:13:05] you but in growing you get to a point
[1:13:08] where it doesn't bother you
[1:13:11] anymore brother Braham had to grow
[1:13:13] brother Braham was saying this on Sunday
[1:13:15] brother Braham got to a stage in his
[1:13:17] life where the testimony about him was
[1:13:21] that you know he he would he loved
[1:13:24] everybody even his worst enemies and he
[1:13:27] said that there were men that will hug
[1:13:29] him and say to him brother br oh I love
[1:13:31] and appreciate you and he said by the
[1:13:34] gift God has given him he could tell
[1:13:36] that if they had a shortgun they will
[1:13:38] kill him but he still loved them all the
[1:13:41] same but brother Braham was not that
[1:13:43] like that from the
[1:13:45] beginning brother brah told a funny
[1:13:47] story in blaser's names when he was
[1:13:49] talking about growth if you have time
[1:13:51] just go listen to that message he said
[1:13:53] the very first time that he had to
[1:13:56] preach he said he got there and
[1:13:59] delivered a wonderful service and the
[1:14:02] women cried and people cried and
[1:14:04] everything was it felt it felt good so
[1:14:07] it felt so good at the end of the
[1:14:08] service he went to his Pastor Roy Davis
[1:14:10] and said how did I do and said real
[1:14:16] hopeful I said but the women
[1:14:18] cried I said no he said because you
[1:14:21] didn't preach about the Bible you just
[1:14:23] told a story of an old woman and you
[1:14:26] made people
[1:14:29] cry so brother BR himself had to grow he
[1:14:32] acknowledged the fact that he was once a
[1:14:34] baby not just in his Christian life but
[1:14:37] even in the
[1:14:38] ministry but he had to grow but that
[1:14:41] doesn't mean he wasn't
[1:14:43] born but said the new bird if a birth is
[1:14:46] born from the outside from the inside
[1:14:47] out the child grows if it leaves if it
[1:14:49] doesn't it remains is that right well
[1:14:51] when the birth is on the inside
[1:14:53] shouldn't It Grow the Christ in your
[1:14:56] heart ought to be growing daily getting
[1:14:58] bigger more
[1:15:00] powerful understanding things better
[1:15:03] forgiven working on as God would till
[1:15:05] Christ be formed in you the hope of
[1:15:07] glory said we must contend with the weak
[1:15:10] until they are fully mature in Christ
[1:15:12] Jesus then they are good soldiers then
[1:15:15] they've got a full they got on the full
[1:15:17] armor talk about them don't hurt
[1:15:21] them why because now they're growing
[1:15:24] laugh at them make fun of them they
[1:15:26] don't pay no attention to it they got
[1:15:27] one thing they're just so big my just so
[1:15:30] full of Glory the only thing you have to
[1:15:32] drop is this old robe of
[1:15:35] Flesh so it's taking us to a state where
[1:15:38] the only thing that we will not be
[1:15:41] perfect will be our
[1:15:43] flesh but there's a promise for the
[1:15:45] flesh there's a promise of redemption
[1:15:48] for this
[1:15:49] flesh so it went on to say
[1:15:54] don't pay attention to you they got one
[1:15:56] thing they're just so big my just so
[1:15:58] full of Glory the only thing you have to
[1:15:59] drop is this old robe of Flesh and just
[1:16:01] go right on to Glory see somebody say
[1:16:04] you know somebody said you was a
[1:16:05] hypocrite Mrs Jones did well God bless
[1:16:09] them do you know certain certain thing
[1:16:11] is going on at that church ordering to
[1:16:13] be going well I'll pray for it see big
[1:16:17] oh if you're little then you say oh it
[1:16:19] is let me get in which side must I join
[1:16:22] see that is where you get in trouble
[1:16:25] that's where you can't
[1:16:29] mature we all need
[1:16:31] growth but when you get big enough large
[1:16:34] enough you see swelled out not only
[1:16:36] swelled out but growed out Christ
[1:16:39] growing in you growing out malice taking
[1:16:42] it out of you this is a child that's
[1:16:44] been born this is someone filled with
[1:16:46] the Holy Ghost push it out as God comes
[1:16:49] in just pushes it out you say oh how
[1:16:52] little how jite it is how much kids it
[1:16:56] is to argue and fce but first thing you
[1:16:59] know that just grow over top of it and
[1:17:03] got no more room for it oh I used to
[1:17:05] hate to see this and hate that but you
[1:17:07] know I just got so I just don't pay any
[1:17:10] attention to it no more you're growing
[1:17:14] yes sir you know when you're young the
[1:17:16] claim you have growing pains when you
[1:17:18] growing you know what I mean it means
[1:17:20] you're getting bigger a little you know
[1:17:23] you you take your arms will hurt your
[1:17:25] legs will hurt when you're growing kids
[1:17:27] I had it I was getting bigger all the
[1:17:30] time sometimes we have growing pains
[1:17:34] when we get to be men and women when
[1:17:35] we're born in the kingdom of God Christ
[1:17:39] but the thing about that it hurts that's
[1:17:40] the physical right the thing about this
[1:17:43] it just makes you joyful and
[1:17:46] happy you feel more of the presence of
[1:17:50] God sometimes when you when you move
[1:17:52] close to the the old veterans you
[1:17:54] Veterans of the faith you just see how
[1:17:56] calm they
[1:17:57] are even in situations because they have
[1:18:01] experienced God they have seen him they
[1:18:04] have tried and tested him and they know
[1:18:07] that he is
[1:18:09] true so brother Abraham said this you
[1:18:11] don't feel the pains this one makes you
[1:18:14] joyful and happy it's growing pains
[1:18:16] you're going out getting bigger getting
[1:18:18] to a bigger man now what you used to be
[1:18:20] you can look over things say not just
[1:18:23] you got wider shoulders that don't mean
[1:18:25] nothing about it but you're wider in
[1:18:27] here see not across here in here is
[1:18:31] where you're supposed to spread out get
[1:18:33] bigger in your heart on the inside when
[1:18:36] Christ comes into the heart now this is
[1:18:40] Brother describing the
[1:18:42] progressive process of
[1:18:45] growth and I could relate with this
[1:18:47] because I dealt with some things in my
[1:18:51] life that has to to do with
[1:18:55] lust and when I read this at the early
[1:18:59] stage of me receiving the Holy Ghost it
[1:19:02] helped me to understand what was going
[1:19:04] on in my
[1:19:07] life because I didn't just become
[1:19:11] perfect no evil
[1:19:13] thoughts I'm not even there
[1:19:17] yet
[1:19:19] right but brother Braham made us
[1:19:22] understand like this that you cannot
[1:19:26] just allow Satan to deny what God has
[1:19:29] done because an evil thought which is
[1:19:31] not your thought comes into your mind
[1:19:33] and Satan tells you it's yours and then
[1:19:35] you hold on to it right so when Christ
[1:19:39] comes into the
[1:19:41] heart he comes into the mouth then he
[1:19:45] comes into the eyes it comes into the
[1:19:48] mind now that is progress a progressive
[1:19:52] process
[1:19:53] now he said it comes into the mouth it
[1:19:55] makes you talk different so that's the
[1:19:56] first thing you start to do you start to
[1:19:58] talk like a Christian all the swear
[1:20:00] words they just
[1:20:02] disappear you don't talk like you used
[1:20:04] to Christ got in your mouth don't Gro
[1:20:07] now from your heart your love you had
[1:20:09] for him so you can brittle your tongue
[1:20:12] brother that's a great thing then the
[1:20:14] next thing you know it grows into your
[1:20:16] eyes the next thing you know you find
[1:20:20] out that old lustful things you used to
[1:20:22] look at you'll turn your head you're
[1:20:26] growing then the first thing you know
[1:20:29] you still turn your head your head but
[1:20:32] you're
[1:20:34] thinking so I will turn my head but
[1:20:37] because I was thinking Satan was telling
[1:20:38] me I didn't have the Holy
[1:20:42] Ghost but it's a
[1:20:45] process but you're thinking see after it
[1:20:47] while it grows into your mind you don't
[1:20:50] even think about it no more after a
[1:20:56] while after a
[1:21:00] while we don't all grow the
[1:21:05] same sometimes you see a seven-year-old
[1:21:07] that look like a 10 yearold sometimes
[1:21:09] you see a seven-year-old they look like
[1:21:11] a
[1:21:12] 5-year-old we don't all grow the
[1:21:15] same but when we were born and as we
[1:21:18] continue to feed on the word we start to
[1:21:21] grow amen
[1:21:24] after a while it grows into your mind
[1:21:26] you don't even think about it no more
[1:21:28] then you're just a great big boy then
[1:21:31] you're coming into a full matured man
[1:21:34] leaving for the Lord so then you are in
[1:21:37] Christ then a new
[1:21:42] creature so what happens between when
[1:21:44] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:46] Ghost like I've said brother Bram said
[1:21:48] the seal appears on two sides and he has
[1:21:51] told us receiving the Holy Ghost when
[1:21:53] you give your life to Christ and you're
[1:21:55] baptized in water and what the promise
[1:21:57] that was given in Acts chapter 238
[1:22:00] becomes yours you receive the Holy
[1:22:03] Ghost what happens in between that and
[1:22:07] when you become as brother brah said a
[1:22:09] perfect living image of
[1:22:12] God anytime we say the first fruit the
[1:22:16] first sheep came to maturity and was
[1:22:19] waved what are we saying brother Ram
[1:22:21] Grew From baby to
[1:22:24] maturity he grew to a state where he
[1:22:26] could love his bitterest enemies that's
[1:22:28] not
[1:22:31] easy there people that have been in the
[1:22:33] faith for many many years they're not
[1:22:34] there yet but we know that that is what
[1:22:37] we are waiting for for all of us to come
[1:22:39] to that state like Peter said come to
[1:22:42] that full measure of the fullness of
[1:22:49] Christ now brother Bram was asked a
[1:22:51] question in questions and answers number
[1:22:54] four this was
[1:22:57] 1964 I don't try to make a different
[1:23:00] somewh but the RAM PRI unless he
[1:23:02] corrects something but I've we've gone
[1:23:05] from 51 all the way to 64 and I've seen
[1:23:08] cons consistency in everything but the
[1:23:10] BR
[1:23:12] said so this was the question Romans
[1:23:16] 71418 we know that the law is spiritual
[1:23:19] but I am carnal sold under sin for that
[1:23:21] which I do
[1:23:23] not for for what I would that I would
[1:23:26] not but what I hate that I do if then I
[1:23:30] do that which I would
[1:23:33] not um unto the law consent to the law
[1:23:36] that it is good now then it is no more I
[1:23:38] that dwell it but sin that dwelleth in
[1:23:41] me and the person said this I cannot
[1:23:44] understand so it was a question that was
[1:23:46] given to brother brah let's listen
[1:23:47] brother braham's
[1:23:48] answer said well they wrote out the
[1:23:50] scripture that's Paul speaking to the
[1:23:52] Romans now he said let me just kind of
[1:23:54] Polish it up so you can see he said in
[1:23:57] me is two
[1:23:59] persons right one wants me to go do
[1:24:04] wrong the other wants me to do and every
[1:24:07] time I start to do right the wrong
[1:24:09] hinders me how many of you people on the
[1:24:12] interviews this afternoon has run that
[1:24:14] same thing and this morning see same
[1:24:16] thing I spoke on it this morning
[1:24:19] temporarily that means brother Braham
[1:24:21] has spoken to people as at this time he
[1:24:24] was saying referring to people he had
[1:24:26] spoken to on private interviews that
[1:24:28] afternoon that had the same
[1:24:32] question but said you an outward man
[1:24:35] which is controlled by six senses it
[1:24:37] meant five senses here you are an inward
[1:24:40] man controlled by one sense which is
[1:24:43] Faith how many of us know that brother
[1:24:45] said it's only when you have the Holy
[1:24:47] Ghost that you have that inward sense
[1:24:49] that is Faith right when you don't have
[1:24:51] the Holy Ghost it is doubt but when you
[1:24:54] receive the Holy Ghost it is faith that
[1:24:57] tells us that he's talking about someone
[1:24:59] that has the Holy
[1:25:02] Ghost and this Faith disagrees with
[1:25:06] all five senses if the five senses don't
[1:25:09] agree with faith but one is contrary to
[1:25:12] the other now as long as the five senses
[1:25:15] agree with the faith wonderful but when
[1:25:18] the five senses disagrees with faith
[1:25:21] then leave leave the five senses alone
[1:25:24] now for instance here Jesus made a
[1:25:26] statement a promise the inside man says
[1:25:29] that is
[1:25:30] true the Inside Man is the Holy Ghost in
[1:25:33] you the outside man which is this flesh
[1:25:36] reasons that it cannot be true then
[1:25:39] ignore the outside man and accept the
[1:25:41] Inside Man now that's the same thing
[1:25:43] that Paul is speaking of he was sold
[1:25:45] under the law to carel scene every one
[1:25:48] of us is the same having
[1:25:51] troubles have the troubles we do have
[1:25:53] married four or five times and this and
[1:25:55] that all kinds of sin and adulteries
[1:25:57] everything else all together in our
[1:26:00] lives is because of those things and
[1:26:02] brother brah is not saying here that
[1:26:03] someone has received the Holy Ghost
[1:26:04] would do those things brother brah was
[1:26:06] explaining that that is a
[1:26:08] natural thing that we have to deal with
[1:26:11] because the Holy Spirit we're going to
[1:26:12] get there very soon gives us the ability
[1:26:16] to put this body under
[1:26:21] control
[1:26:22] we are
[1:26:24] carnal and that must perish but then
[1:26:28] inside we a spirit Man soul inside and
[1:26:30] that's faith in God's word then we bring
[1:26:32] a outside body under
[1:26:35] subjection to the Word of Faith by
[1:26:38] accepting what God Said the person who
[1:26:41] has not received the Holy Ghost might
[1:26:43] desire to bring their body under
[1:26:45] subjection but they're not able
[1:26:47] to but the person who has received the
[1:26:50] Holy Ghost is able to bring their body
[1:26:52] under subjection however we're going to
[1:26:55] read it very soon in a minute they still
[1:26:58] have a sticky nature that bothers
[1:27:01] them when they in this flesh what does
[1:27:03] that mean they are tempted by
[1:27:06] it it doesn't say they always fall into
[1:27:08] the temptation but even if they ever
[1:27:11] fall into that Temptation they rise
[1:27:17] immediately that is a sign you know you
[1:27:19] don't do something and you wait 5 months
[1:27:21] before you confess it I won't say you
[1:27:23] don't have the Holy Ghost but check
[1:27:27] it but if you have the Holy Ghost the
[1:27:29] thing that brings conviction in your
[1:27:30] heart is that Holy Ghost to say what why
[1:27:33] how would I have done this and you want
[1:27:34] to make it right right
[1:27:38] away brother brah said how can I take a
[1:27:41] bir and make a grain of wheed out
[1:27:43] of it it's impossible for me to do it
[1:27:45] the only way it can be is because inside
[1:27:48] that cockle has been transmitted from a
[1:27:51] cockle wheat a cockle bur to a germ
[1:27:54] called wheat life then you bury that
[1:27:57] cockle bur and It produced a grain of
[1:28:00] weight because there has been a life of
[1:28:03] weight put in that cockle be so the
[1:28:06] cockle be if there's no life of wheat in
[1:28:09] it will still produce colear
[1:28:12] right because that is the life you
[1:28:14] whatever the the Lord that God gave let
[1:28:17] it bring forth according to His Kind now
[1:28:20] there is a wheat life put in the
[1:28:23] cocklebur and because there's been a
[1:28:25] life of weight put in the cocklebur and
[1:28:26] the life of the cockle has been taken
[1:28:29] out but the nature of the cockle B is
[1:28:33] still
[1:28:35] sticky so though it is carrying the life
[1:28:38] of the wheat if you're working in the
[1:28:40] field where that cockoo is you are still
[1:28:42] going to get those sticky things on your
[1:28:44] clothes because the outside is a
[1:28:49] bur and it will be on until this new
[1:28:53] life has fully been developed now when
[1:28:58] the wheat fully comes out that nature of
[1:29:00] the but disappears because the
[1:29:02] wheat has now taken
[1:29:04] over has been fully developed out of the
[1:29:07] ground and raised up again when it comes
[1:29:08] forth then it's no more cber but wheat
[1:29:11] but while it is on Earth out of the
[1:29:15] earth and a cockle it's still sticky but
[1:29:17] it's got the nature on the inside of it
[1:29:20] with as long as you in this life you're
[1:29:22] going to be sticky and have a carnal
[1:29:24] nature that's going to bother you he
[1:29:29] didn't say it's going to control
[1:29:31] you it's going to bother you as long as
[1:29:35] you leave but the inside of you you're
[1:29:38] born
[1:29:40] again so the more I take on Christ the
[1:29:43] more I grow the less it bothers
[1:29:46] me because I'm putting more of Christ in
[1:29:49] me I'm feeding it more we're going to
[1:29:50] get there in a little
[1:29:53] while as long as you leave but inside of
[1:29:56] you you're born again and when you're
[1:29:58] raised up you're in the likeness of
[1:29:59] Christ and all the sin has gone from you
[1:30:03] but brah went on to talk about an Indian
[1:30:05] Chief and now he came to the Lord and
[1:30:07] then talked about a conversation that
[1:30:08] someone had with this Indian Chief and
[1:30:10] said to him said to somebody told me he
[1:30:13] had one time was converted received the
[1:30:15] Holy Ghost now speaking about the Indian
[1:30:17] Chief and he said to him how you getting
[1:30:20] along and he said pretty good good and
[1:30:22] pretty bad he said well how do you mean
[1:30:25] pretty bad and pretty good he said well
[1:30:27] since me received the Holy Ghost he said
[1:30:29] there's been two dogs in me and one of
[1:30:32] them a black dog and one of them a white
[1:30:34] dog and he said they argue all the time
[1:30:38] said the growl and fight at one another
[1:30:41] so the white dog wants me to do good the
[1:30:45] black dog wants me to do bad said well
[1:30:48] Chief which one of them which one of
[1:30:50] them wins the fight
[1:30:52] said that depends on the one she feeds
[1:30:55] the
[1:30:56] most theah says so I think that's a good
[1:31:00] answer here see there just depends on
[1:31:03] the Waring of the body that's in you the
[1:31:07] nature the carnal nature in you Wars
[1:31:10] against the spirit of God the desires
[1:31:11] that when when when when the Holy Spirit
[1:31:13] tells you go and apologize to that
[1:31:16] person maybe your wife maybe your
[1:31:20] husband you feel like well I wasn't
[1:31:23] wrong she was the one that was
[1:31:25] wrong when you have the Holy Ghost you
[1:31:28] you can hold it but you will not be at
[1:31:32] rest cuz he going to eventually bring
[1:31:35] that Pride down that carnal nature of
[1:31:39] pride is going to get it down as long as
[1:31:42] you're feeding on the
[1:31:45] word he said that does
[1:31:48] it now Romans 8 sorry did I read that
[1:31:53] that just depends on the Waring of the
[1:31:54] body that's in you depends on the one
[1:31:56] you carer to which nature you CER to the
[1:31:58] caral nature after the things of the
[1:32:00] world or the spiritual nature after the
[1:32:02] things of God that does it Romans 8:11
[1:32:05] to13 Paul says if the spirits of him
[1:32:08] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:32:10] in you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:32:13] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[1:32:14] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:32:17] you therefore brethren we are debors not
[1:32:20] to the flesh
[1:32:22] meaning the flesh is
[1:32:24] there and that's what I want you to know
[1:32:27] tonight let your expectations be right
[1:32:30] if you have received the Holy
[1:32:33] Ghost you might still see that in your
[1:32:36] life everything is not
[1:32:38] perfect especially if you don't feed on
[1:32:41] the word as often as you
[1:32:44] should especially if you starve the
[1:32:47] spirit or sometimes you grieve the
[1:32:50] spirit and how does that happen most
[1:32:53] times it happens by us resisting the
[1:32:56] spirit the spirit says do this he said
[1:33:00] no do this no brother said in the lamb
[1:33:02] and the dove he said he's going to go
[1:33:03] set
[1:33:05] somewhere and keep waiting for you to
[1:33:07] make your ways
[1:33:09] right it doesn't mean you lost the Holy
[1:33:12] Ghost because he also said you're sealed
[1:33:14] until the day of your Redemption but
[1:33:16] what he want so that he will not cut
[1:33:18] short your
[1:33:19] life that's something we should not
[1:33:22] forget if you're filled with the Holy
[1:33:24] Ghost and we decide not to listen to God
[1:33:27] he gets to a point where he says well
[1:33:29] rather than you disgrace me I'll cut
[1:33:31] shut your
[1:33:33] life that's also part of what said but
[1:33:36] we don't want to deny what God has done
[1:33:39] because we don't want to live an
[1:33:40] underprivileged life so Paul is telling
[1:33:43] us we're not de us we're de is not to
[1:33:46] the flesh to live after the flesh if ye
[1:33:48] live after the flesh you shall die but
[1:33:51] if if ye through the spirit do modify
[1:33:56] the Deeds of the body ye shall leave now
[1:34:00] the word modify what it means here is to
[1:34:04] put to
[1:34:08] death I put to that make us that I
[1:34:11] render weak
[1:34:15] important so the more we St this nature
[1:34:20] the things in likes the end
[1:34:21] entertainment he
[1:34:22] loves the pride that he loves to have
[1:34:26] the way he likes to look at himself as
[1:34:28] as better than others all those
[1:34:30] attributes of the flesh the more we
[1:34:32] start it the more we modify
[1:34:36] it now just in closing I'm going to read
[1:34:40] the private interview there are 15
[1:34:42] paragraphs there if you can bring that
[1:34:44] up that would be good thank
[1:34:46] you there are 15 paragraphs there I will
[1:34:49] be quick I know that
[1:34:52] it's
[1:34:53] almost um
[1:34:56] 9:00 kids are going to school tomorrow
[1:34:59] hours as well so I know what that
[1:35:03] means so this was an interview that
[1:35:06] brother Braham had with sister
[1:35:08] Bruce um visit in the hospital brother
[1:35:10] Bram said I visit you in the hospital
[1:35:12] that time and I prayed constantly so she
[1:35:14] wasn't in the hospital now but brother
[1:35:16] BR was referring to the time he visited
[1:35:18] her constantly God won't let you die cuz
[1:35:21] you of value to the church praise God
[1:35:25] now I know you I know you are going to
[1:35:27] be all right sister to Bruce I believe
[1:35:29] that with all my heart sister Georgia
[1:35:31] Bruce says brother Braham most of all I
[1:35:34] want the experience that I have been
[1:35:36] sealed in the Holy Ghost and if God will
[1:35:39] reveal it to your heart she had a heart
[1:35:42] condition she was really sick she didn't
[1:35:43] know if she was going to make it so this
[1:35:46] was the primary objective that she had
[1:35:49] this is the top request I want to be
[1:35:51] sure I have the Holy
[1:35:53] Ghost I believe with all my heart that
[1:35:55] you are real Born Again believer that's
[1:35:57] brother
[1:35:58] Braham replying to her sister Bruce how
[1:36:01] could that Spirit just
[1:36:03] leave when you get sick you get weary
[1:36:06] and you're a nervous type person sister
[1:36:08] Bruce says yes and you get things in
[1:36:11] your mind see a little bit of things it
[1:36:13] just keeps building up both ways some
[1:36:16] people are built to be
[1:36:19] overthinkers a little thing happen
[1:36:22] happens the thought just keeps going oh
[1:36:25] that's why they did this oh that's why I
[1:36:27] did that oh and then oh wow they felt
[1:36:30] bad about it and then the enemy gets you
[1:36:32] to build something that did not
[1:36:37] exist you get things on your mind see
[1:36:39] little bit of things it just keeps
[1:36:41] building up both ways and you'll get
[1:36:43] somebody in your heart you want to pray
[1:36:45] for them get up and pray for it you
[1:36:48] can't rest till you get that person
[1:36:51] prayed for the holy spirit says pray for
[1:36:53] someone you can't so she she was built
[1:36:56] that
[1:36:59] way um you can't rest till you get that
[1:37:02] person prayed for that's you then take
[1:37:04] on the other side Satan Maybe Might
[1:37:07] present something out of this way see
[1:37:10] then God you are a nature and God works
[1:37:13] and Satan works and then when Satan
[1:37:16] tries to make you believe that you are
[1:37:18] not you're not a Believer see you keep
[1:37:20] building
[1:37:21] this and maybe this and this see don't
[1:37:25] look at yourself sister Bruce
[1:37:28] remember I'm fixing to pray for you I'm
[1:37:30] not worthy of that I think what will I
[1:37:33] do if Jesus Christ was sitting here now
[1:37:36] what will he do if he was s sitting here
[1:37:39] he'd lay his hands upon you and with his
[1:37:41] great faith see you'll get well well I'm
[1:37:44] I think well I'm a sinner I'm not him
[1:37:46] but I come to represent him but remember
[1:37:49] me being a Sina and before oh God I'm
[1:37:51] not a sinner neither are you we got a
[1:37:55] blood sacrifice laying there God don't
[1:37:59] even see us he hears our voice but he
[1:38:03] sees the blood of Christ that's it see
[1:38:05] he sees the blood of his own son it's
[1:38:07] our voice Christ's blood then it's
[1:38:10] Christ that's talking through us to God
[1:38:13] so therefore we are not Sinners no more
[1:38:15] we are Christian I believe you to be a
[1:38:18] genuine Christian woman I remember
[1:38:21] remember the thing sister Bruce says I
[1:38:23] make so many mistakes and I fail so many
[1:38:27] times said that's why Christ had to die
[1:38:30] so that you with your mistakes won't be
[1:38:33] led to you see he took your mistakes
[1:38:36] your desire in your heart is to serve
[1:38:40] him the
[1:38:43] desire sister Bruce says yes all right
[1:38:46] that's what he died for so you could
[1:38:47] serve him see not your mistakes you not
[1:38:49] looked not led to to you see is your
[1:38:52] propitiation see is your sin offering
[1:38:55] your sins are not known you not a sinner
[1:38:57] before God Christ took your sins and
[1:39:00] became you because your desire is to
[1:39:03] serve him sister Bruce says but I have
[1:39:06] never had an experience that I have been
[1:39:08] filled with the Holy Ghost that I could
[1:39:10] put my foot on remember she lived in a
[1:39:13] in a time where everyone said for you to
[1:39:16] know that you have the ho ghost you got
[1:39:17] to speak in tongues there's certain
[1:39:18] things you have to do all of those
[1:39:19] manifestation she couldn't put her foot
[1:39:21] on any of those
[1:39:25] things and that was a good question
[1:39:27] because right here she was
[1:39:29] say I don't think I have the Holy
[1:39:32] Ghost all right notice this ordinarily a
[1:39:35] human being is born and sin shaped in
[1:39:37] iniquity come to the world speak in lies
[1:39:40] that's the nature of a human being now
[1:39:42] brother Braham was trying to tell us
[1:39:44] that the holy spirit is not a single
[1:39:48] event by replying sister Bruce
[1:39:51] there is a birth and there is a
[1:39:54] growth that was your
[1:39:57] nature so the nature that brother BR was
[1:40:00] referring to is our old nature born in
[1:40:02] sin shaped iniquity come to the world to
[1:40:03] speak in lies that was your nature it
[1:40:05] changed
[1:40:08] once but what Chang it she said Christ
[1:40:12] said there you are sister see that's it
[1:40:15] he that heareth my words and believeth
[1:40:16] on him that sent me at eternal life and
[1:40:18] shall not come to the Judgment but Earth
[1:40:21] past tense passed from that to life St
[1:40:24] John 5:24 Jesus
[1:40:28] speaking so once you
[1:40:31] know that your nature
[1:40:34] changed that shows that you receive the
[1:40:36] Holy Ghost because it's only God that
[1:40:38] can change your
[1:40:40] nature you desire the right thing you
[1:40:43] have received the power the things that
[1:40:45] you used to do before like Paul said the
[1:40:47] life that I now live is no more I that
[1:40:49] liveth but Christ that liveth in me but
[1:40:52] then he still said I find another law in
[1:40:54] my members that is Waring against the
[1:40:57] law of
[1:41:01] God brother Ram
[1:41:03] said so you are a Christian sister
[1:41:07] Bruce I've watched your life I've
[1:41:10] watched you under Vision now he gets
[1:41:14] into the prophetic R I've watched you on
[1:41:17] the
[1:41:18] vision she didn't think she was born
[1:41:20] again she didn't think she had the Holy
[1:41:22] Ghost but the prophet of God could see
[1:41:24] her on the
[1:41:25] vision and say I've watched you on the
[1:41:27] vision and know you are a Christian not
[1:41:30] one spec see I'm your Shepherd as it was
[1:41:33] Sister Bruce says yes somebody to help
[1:41:35] see if there was any doubt in my mind if
[1:41:37] I thought you were something was wrong
[1:41:39] I'll tell you sister Bruce I believe
[1:41:41] that she said but if there's anything
[1:41:43] wrong in your experience anything wrong
[1:41:45] between you and God as far as I know
[1:41:47] anything about it sister Bruce there's
[1:41:49] another thing there is not one
[1:41:53] thing and then he said that we're going
[1:41:56] to pray I'll call the musicians now it's
[1:41:58] right nine other
[1:42:02] dots but brothers and
[1:42:04] sisters don't let the devil lie to
[1:42:08] you if you set your life and you haven't
[1:42:10] received the Holy Ghost it's it's it's
[1:42:12] not something that you need to T
[1:42:16] for the time they were told to T was in
[1:42:20] the time when Jesus J
[1:42:22] ascended they had to T onto the day of
[1:42:24] Pentecost since that time there's been
[1:42:26] no taring that was required meaning that
[1:42:30] it is available even right
[1:42:35] now but if you have been filled with the
[1:42:37] Holy
[1:42:39] Ghost and you've lost the joy of your
[1:42:42] salvation but the Braham said that David
[1:42:45] did not lose his salvation you only lost
[1:42:48] the joy of
[1:42:49] it and after losing that Joy he was
[1:42:53] asking God to restore unto me the joy of
[1:42:56] my
[1:42:57] salvation there's a restoration
[1:43:00] tonight if there are questions in your
[1:43:02] heart about the Holy Ghost and you know
[1:43:04] that God has changed your nature it's
[1:43:07] not hard just tell the devil you're a
[1:43:10] liar God has exposed you tonight and
[1:43:13] then you continue to feed on the word
[1:43:16] continue to feel that spirit of God
[1:43:19] that's in you that nature of God that is
[1:43:21] in you and before you know you will
[1:43:23] completely kill the de of the body let's
[1:43:27] be on our
[1:43:30] [Music]
[1:43:35] feet dear
[1:43:38] father I believe
[1:43:41] it's your design that this will go this
[1:43:43] way
[1:43:46] tonight I believe with all my heart that
[1:43:49] there are people that have this question
[1:43:50] on their heart
[1:43:52] and you have just brought it this way to
[1:43:55] meet the needs of your
[1:43:57] people they are your people there Lord
[1:43:59] Jesus and you care about
[1:44:02] them that's why Lord Jesus you yourself
[1:44:05] plac as
[1:44:06] gifts the fivefold in the church you
[1:44:10] didn't just leave your church Lord Jesus
[1:44:12] to try to fend for
[1:44:14] itself you are ascended on high but you
[1:44:17] give gifts unto men not because the men
[1:44:20] are worthy Lord Jesus but because you
[1:44:22] are
[1:44:23] worthy and you able Lord Jesus to
[1:44:26] continue to meet the needs of your
[1:44:29] people I ask Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:44:31] anyone that had that question as you
[1:44:34] have given them an assurance tonight May
[1:44:37] Satan never be able to deceive them
[1:44:39] again May the enemy never be able to
[1:44:42] Lord Jesus confuse them Lord Jesus
[1:44:45] Christ father Lord with whatever Lord
[1:44:47] Jesus is happening in their lives Lord
[1:44:50] if anyone has lost the joy of their
[1:44:52] salvation I ask Lord that you restore
[1:44:55] unto them the joy of that
[1:44:57] salvation I ask you help each and every
[1:44:59] one of us to grow in you Lord Jesus to

[1:55:58] spirit Lord confirm to me that I've got

[1:56:15] Savior will you bring us all to that
[1:56:18] point
[1:56:21] [Music]
[1:56:30] I don't want to change this atmosphere
[1:56:32] just I'll call a brother
[1:56:36] [Music]
[1:56:48] Emanuel
[1:56:53] [Music]
[1:56:55] God bless your
[1:56:57] Saints um as he spoke I was just
[1:57:01] thinking about the relationship between
[1:57:05] parents and their
[1:57:07] children you see that
[1:57:09] uh most children want to
[1:57:12] grow but there is nothing they can do on
[1:57:15] their own to
[1:57:17] grow and even parents who wants to see
[1:57:20] their children
[1:57:22] grow but they cannot just make them grow
[1:57:25] by any magical
[1:57:27] powers but if they do just what is
[1:57:30] needed just the food and the children
[1:57:34] just eat it the growth will
[1:57:37] come right
[1:57:40] um you see
[1:57:42] the
[1:57:44] children and the eating of the food they
[1:57:47] have to want to eat it
[1:57:52] and one slight sign of maturity is when
[1:57:56] the child
[1:57:58] stops putting the toy in their mouth or
[1:58:02] the shoe in their mouth or the
[1:58:05] pen and actually they want to put only
[1:58:08] food in their
[1:58:09] mouth that is a sign of matur it's not
[1:58:12] complete but once they start willfully
[1:58:15] eating food you know the growth will
[1:58:18] definitely come
[1:58:20] and I believe sometimes that is where we
[1:58:22] have to get to where we are able to
[1:58:25] overcome the
[1:58:27] distractions there are so many when we
[1:58:31] able to overcome them and just focus on
[1:58:34] what has been given to us cuz I believe
[1:58:37] there there is no greater treasure
[1:58:39] handed to humanity than what we have
[1:58:42] received in this end
[1:58:43] time so let's just in all
[1:58:46] humility just just just understand the
[1:58:50] the dangers of these sweet distractions
[1:58:52] that surround
[1:58:53] us and just focus on only and only
[1:58:58] feeling it's in us the food will bring
[1:59:01] it out let's bow down our hearts before
[1:59:05] him our Lord our King our Master Our
[1:59:09] Savior our
