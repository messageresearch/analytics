[0:02] God bless you Saints
[0:07] when I heard about uh
[0:10] Sister Laura person just
[0:13] bothered me so much and I thought about
[0:16] it through other nights I was just so
[0:18] worried for the family knowing that I'm
[0:20] also a mother
[0:22] and
[0:23] I just couldn't take my mind off it then
[0:26] I was just asking myself I'm like why
[0:29] would this happen
[0:31] but then one thing came to my mind said
[0:34] Just Praise His Name and
[0:39] I just had that song and I said I wanted
[0:41] to sing it maybe it would be a blessing
[0:43] to someone so may God bless you as you
[0:46] listen
[0:48] [Music]
[1:08] when you up against the wall
[1:12] and the mountain seems so tall
[1:16] and you realize
[1:19] life's not always Fair
[1:25] you can run away and hide
[1:29] and let the old man decide or you can
[1:34] change your circumstances
[1:37] with a prayer foreign
[1:42] [Music]
[2:14] foreign
[2:17] [Music]
[2:44] [Music]
[2:50] you just praise His name
[2:58] oh and you can overcome by the blood of
[3:06] the
[3:06] lamb and by the word of your testimony
[3:15] you see the darkness go as your faith
[3:21] begins to grow
[3:24] you're not alone so how can you be
[3:28] lonely
[3:31] foreign
[3:34] [Music]
[3:50] [Music]
[4:04] foreign
[4:06] [Music]
[4:45] when everything falls
[4:49] apart
[4:51] praise His name when you feel you can go
[4:56] on just raise your hands and
[5:01] say
[5:03] Raider is he
[5:06] that is within me
[5:09] [Music]
[5:16] [Laughter]
[5:18] [Music]
[5:22] that is within me you can praise
[5:30] [Music]
[5:33] if you'll just praise His name
