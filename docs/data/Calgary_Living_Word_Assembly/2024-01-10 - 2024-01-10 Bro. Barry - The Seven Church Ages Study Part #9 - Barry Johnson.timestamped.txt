[16:57] the Lord richly bless you all you have a
[17:00] need tonight maybe just make it known by
[17:02] the way of an uplift hand we have a few
[17:05] prayer requests tonight we would like to
[17:07] bring before the church Before the
[17:09] Throne um one is a praise report for
[17:12] brother Pete Clawson who is improving in
[17:15] condition he was moved from the hospital
[17:18] as I understand to more of a
[17:20] rehabilitation Ward which is a
[17:22] tremendous thing for a man at his age
[17:26] certainly want to thank the Lord for
[17:28] that
[17:29] we want to remember Sister Crystal
[17:31] clawen who is diagnosed with covid and
[17:35] uh that the family won't get it that it
[17:37] will just uh I guess be
[17:40] contained uh we'd like to remember
[17:42] Brennan mcgilvery who was an employee of
[17:44] brother Paul and sister Elaine in their
[17:47] company needs a touch from the Lord we
[17:50] want to remember Jerry Carpenter brother
[17:52] Jerry and Sister Mary Carpenter but the
[17:55] Jerry was diagnosed from the dentist to
[17:58] that he needs plate and and pins in his
[18:01] jaw because he had an x-ray and his jaw
[18:04] is cracked and the dentist said that it
[18:06] will uh it will be a nuisance for him
[18:09] for the rest of his life if he doesn't
[18:11] have this operation and he and his wife
[18:13] don't want the operation they want to
[18:16] walk by faith and trust that the Lord
[18:17] will touch them and uh I honestly said
[18:21] to them I think you know God uses
[18:23] doctors I wouldn't shy away from that
[18:25] necessarily but you have to go by your
[18:27] faith the level of faith that God has
[18:29] given you and uh they just told me a
[18:32] testimony and I thought it was so good
[18:34] sister Mary said she got up in the night
[18:37] and uh somehow one of her hair pins
[18:39] dropped on the floor in the middle of
[18:42] the night brother Jerry without a
[18:44] hearing Aiden heard it hit the
[18:47] floor so I said brother brother Jerry
[18:50] actually heard a pin
[18:52] drop you know what the Lord can move in
[18:55] uh any way he wants and I believe
[18:58] believe he's just looking for us to
[18:59] trust
[19:00] him I'd also like to bring Before the
[19:03] Throne tonight my nephew Zach
[19:06] nadak he was diagnosed with a broken arm
[19:09] he had a broken arm for a couple of days
[19:11] and uh a sore arm for a couple of days
[19:14] and went to the hospital and was
[19:15] diagnosed with a broken arm and
[19:18] apparently the medication that he takes
[19:20] for the uh muscular distrophy that he
[19:23] suffers uh is causing
[19:26] osteoporosis and so some how one of the
[19:29] caregivers putting on his coat or his
[19:31] shirt or something Mis maneuvered his
[19:34] arm and broke
[19:35] it so his parents are uh really uh
[19:40] desperately trying to seek Direction and
[19:42] Leadership for what they should do and
[19:44] and how to go forwards with this
[19:46] because who knows what to do if you have
[19:49] a need tonight maybe just make it known

[26:28] this word and then how many people are
[26:31] there in Medicine Hat that would desire
[26:33] to hear this word and how many are there
[26:35] in Red Deer and how many more are there
[26:37] in Calgary that already know about this
[26:39] word but just maybe don't Fellowship for
[26:41] whatever reason or or maybe they don't
[26:43] know that there's a a a church here we
[26:45] don't know I think it's just wonderful
[26:47] to see what the Lord's doing so if you
[26:50] can just pray with us pray for us uh as
[26:52] we travel and that the Lord will
[26:54] continue to move in the hearts of the
[26:56] Saints in Lethbridge
[26:58] Revelations 1:1 the revelation of Jesus
[27:02] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[27:06] unto his servants things which must
[27:08] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[27:11] signified it by his Angel unto his
[27:12] servant John who bear record of the word
[27:15] of God and of the testimony of Jesus
[27:18] Christ and of all things that he
[27:21] saw blessed is he that readeth and they
[27:24] that hear the words of this prophecy and
[27:27] keep the those things which are written
[27:29] therein for the time is at hand John to
[27:34] the seven churches which are in Asia
[27:37] Grace be unto you and peace from him
[27:40] which is and which was and which is to
[27:44] come and from the seven spirits which
[27:47] are before his
[27:49] throne and from Jesus Christ who is the
[27:54] faithful witness and the first begotten
[27:57] of the the dead and the prince of the
[27:59] kings of the earth unto him that loved
[28:03] us and washed us from our sins in his
[28:07] own
[28:08] blood let's just bow one more time
[28:11] gracious Heavenly Father we're so
[28:13] thankful that you have saved us Lord
[28:17] that you died for us and that you washed
[28:19] us in your own blood father tonight as
[28:23] we go forwards in this study we pray
[28:25] that you would just continue to break it
[28:27] open to us fresh Lord Jesus that Lord
[28:30] this would become a new book to us
[28:32] father that it would Lord just reveal so
[28:35] many new things to us we just commit all
[28:38] the words that are spoken now the rest
[28:40] of this service into your hands For Your
[28:41] Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[28:44] amen God bless you tonight you may be
[28:47] seated tonight I just would like
[28:51] to uh start with page 29 in the
[28:54] exposition of the seven Church ages and
[28:57] and the heading is loosed from sin it's
[29:00] a new uh not a chapter but just a a
[29:03] heading a subheading a sub chapter maybe
[29:06] um hopefully we'll get through this
[29:07] section and get on to chapter two
[29:09] tonight Lord willing um but I would like
[29:12] to take from the very first part of this
[29:15] is Revelations 1:5 and it's the last
[29:19] part of this verse unto him that loved
[29:22] us and washed us from our sins in his
[29:26] own blood
[29:28] I think that's just so beautiful we
[29:29] could preach a whole sermon on that that
[29:32] sentence right there because we know
[29:34] that he's done it all he's the one that
[29:36] saved us and he's the one that washed Us
[29:38] in his own blood there's nothing that we
[29:40] could ever do except for accepted and
[29:42] boy once we accept it when we truly
[29:45] accept it when it's not just lip service
[29:47] when it actually makes that longest
[29:50] journey from the intellectual
[29:52] understanding that 18 inches or 14
[29:55] inches whatever it is from the mind down
[29:57] into the heart where that special place
[29:59] is that God created for himself in the
[30:02] heart of the human being that teeny
[30:04] little spot that he created the throne
[30:06] room of his life his existence in us
[30:10] when that happens brothers and sisters
[30:12] we know it something happens to us we
[30:15] are not the same person that we used to
[30:17] be I just I want to read the last
[30:20] paragraph uh paragraph 116 in the red uh
[30:24] Church age book it says may God begin by
[30:27] his Spirit to give us continuous
[30:30] lifegiving and prevailing revelation we
[30:34] spoke about it last time how important
[30:36] it is when when the preaching of the
[30:38] word is happening when when we're
[30:40] listening maybe when we're just
[30:42] fellowshipping you can be having
[30:44] conversation but all of a sudden
[30:45] fireworks start going off in your mind
[30:47] because of the words that are being
[30:48] spoken and you're you're fellowshipping
[30:50] back and forth about the word of God and
[30:52] that's that's prevailing Revelation it's
[30:55] taking over our minds and in our hearts
[30:57] it's opening the word to us and you know
[31:00] there's many types of Revelation but we
[31:02] only want revelation by the spirit and
[31:05] how will we know if we're talking about
[31:07] Revelation by the spirit in our own
[31:08] lives we can take it right back to the
[31:10] word of God the prophet and the bride
[31:14] and the word will all be saying the same
[31:16] thing the spirit and the bride will say
[31:19] exactly the same words I just love this
[31:22] this this sentence in this verse of
[31:24] revelations: 15 unto him that loosed us
[31:26] and washed us from our sins in his own
[31:30] blood our sins in his own blood you know
[31:36] I I just think that we could just just
[31:38] have have a a praise service right here
[31:40] just based on that one sentence because
[31:43] we know there's nothing that we could
[31:45] ever do and we're going to get right
[31:46] into that here um I just need to get
[31:48] into it and stop trying to preach you
[31:50] know we're just going to teach this so
[31:52] forgive me I just get excited by it I'll
[31:55] save the excitement for Sunday Lord
[31:58] willing paragraph 117 the word washed
[32:02] brother bradam in this uh book the
[32:04] exposition of the seven Church ages is
[32:06] actually
[32:08] loosed where the spirit of the Lord is
[32:10] there is Liberty
[32:12] right is actually loose loosed us from
[32:15] our sins in his own blood isn't that
[32:18] wonderful but are you spiritually minded
[32:21] did you catch it it was his own blood
[32:25] that loosed us completely from our sin
[32:27] sin it was not human blood wait a second
[32:32] it wasn't human blood it was the blood
[32:34] of
[32:35] God how can you dispute this now I know
[32:39] why there's people that say well this
[32:41] book isn't really you know maybe
[32:43] somebody put something in there that
[32:44] maybe shouldn't have been there when you
[32:46] start talking about this this actually
[32:48] changes the whole trinitarian Doctrine
[32:50] completely it can't be uh and you know
[32:53] brother bradam he talks about as soon as
[32:55] you start trying to make God the first
[32:56] person person or the second person or
[32:58] any person you've missed it but it's it
[33:01] was not human blood it was the blood of
[33:03] God Peter called it the blood of Christ
[33:05] Paul called it the blood of the Lord and
[33:08] the blood of Jesus not three persons but
[33:11] one person there is that Revelation
[33:15] again one God that omnipotent Jehovah
[33:18] God came down and made himself a body by
[33:21] means of the Virgin birth and dwelt and
[33:24] indwelt it that it might be the blood of
[33:27] God that would free us loose us entirely
[33:30] from our sins and present us spotless
[33:33] before himself with exceedingly great
[33:36] joy beautiful just
[33:39] beautiful would you like an Old
[33:41] Testament type let's go back to the
[33:43] Garden of Eden when the first news came
[33:45] to Glory the that the son Adam had been
[33:48] lost did God send an angel did he send
[33:53] him no did he send an angel did he send
[33:56] a son
[33:57] did he send another one like unto us no
[34:01] he came himself to redeem that lost son
[34:05] Hallelujah and you know we we hear
[34:07] Brother bam when he preaches this he
[34:09] says when God spoke those words Adam
[34:13] Adam Where Art Thou he knew exactly
[34:16] where Adam was but he wanted Adam to
[34:19] recognize where he was yes right he was
[34:22] God he knew exactly where he was
[34:24] sometimes it's presented in such a way
[34:25] that he was hiding around a tree or or
[34:28] he was hiding behind some sticks or even
[34:30] had a fig Leaf he had a a a a ghillie
[34:33] suit or something and and God just
[34:34] couldn't see him so he had to call his
[34:36] name God knew him he knew exactly where
[34:38] he was spiritually speaking and
[34:41] physically speaking there was no
[34:42] deception there brother Bram goes on to
[34:45] say God did not entrust his Plan of
[34:47] Salvation to another he trusted only
[34:50] himself God was made flesh and dwelt
[34:53] Among Us and redeemed us unto himself
[34:57] were saved by the blood of God the
[34:59] Eternal God indwelt a mortal body in
[35:03] order to take away sin he became the
[35:06] lamb in order to shed his blood and
[35:09] enter into the veil with it and isn't it
[35:13] just a perfect trick of the devil to try
[35:15] and spin it any other way try and make
[35:17] it like a second or a third person or
[35:20] maybe you know Jesus was the the a good
[35:23] brother or a prophet or something he
[35:24] just wasn't maybe God himself in the
[35:27] flesh or or maybe once he actually went
[35:30] into the garden that God left him and
[35:32] now he was just a mortal man whose blood
[35:35] was it it had to be God all the way
[35:38] through because how could Jesus not
[35:40] being God say to the man on the cross
[35:43] today you'll be with me in Paradise how
[35:46] could just a mortal man say that it had
[35:48] to be God all the way
[35:50] through paragraph 119 consider this
[35:53] since it is the blood of God it is
[35:57] perfect
[35:58] blood and if the perfect blood is
[36:00] loosing us from the power and bondage
[36:04] and defilement of sin then the loosing
[36:07] is perfect and
[36:10] complete there is therefore now no
[36:14] condemnation to those who are in Christ
[36:18] that walk not after the flesh they don't
[36:21] look at all the things of this world
[36:23] they put their eyes on Jesus Christ they
[36:27] focus on the things of the spirit those
[36:29] are the ones where there's no
[36:31] condemnation
[36:33] amen he goes on to say who shall lay
[36:35] anything to the charge of God's elect it
[36:38] is God that justifies justifieth
[36:41] declares us righteous who is he that
[36:43] condemneth it is Christ that died Romans
[36:46] 8:33 and
[36:48] 34 the r goes on to say there it is his
[36:51] death gave us the blood the blood has
[36:55] loosed us there is now no condemnation
[36:58] How can there be there is nothing to be
[37:02] condemned for because the blood has
[37:05] loosed us from
[37:09] sin I I just feel like I could dwell
[37:11] here for a little while so I might just
[37:13] pause I don't know if we'll get through
[37:14] this tonight here but brothers and
[37:15] sisters this is I believe just so
[37:17] powerful if we could get this and live
[37:19] this in our lives just believe this in
[37:21] our lives maybe just say this over and
[37:24] over and over to ourselves maybe just
[37:26] play it over and over and over to
[37:27] ourselves there is nothing to be
[37:29] condemned for because the blood has
[37:30] loosed us from sin we are free Guiltless
[37:34] don't listen to man listen to the word
[37:36] you are loosed by the blood if we could
[37:38] do that brothers and sisters totally get
[37:40] that Revelation in our lives I can't I
[37:42] can't think that it would be quiet in
[37:44] here I can't think there would be a
[37:45] person who wouldn't want to raise their
[37:47] hands jump up and down and scream and
[37:49] shout because they recognize they're
[37:52] redeemed all Heaven's going to be quiet
[37:54] one day to listen to the redeemed
[37:56] worship brothers and sisters don't worry
[37:58] about your brother and sister here if
[37:59] you've got something in you that tells
[38:01] you that you are redeemed that you have
[38:04] been saved by his blood there's nothing
[38:06] to be condemned for than worship him you
[38:09] don't have to wait till you get there
[38:15] amen paragraph 121 now don't get tied
[38:18] down again by traditions and Creeds and
[38:21] organizations oh my we don't worship
[38:24] like
[38:25] that we're a
[38:27] multicultural worship group here that's
[38:30] right and you know what every group
[38:33] worships a little bit
[38:35] differently and you know we we can't get
[38:38] bound down by Creeds and and and
[38:40] doctrines and dogmas and say that's not
[38:42] the way I used to worship when I was in
[38:44] church way back over wherever that's not
[38:47] the way that they did it there what's it
[38:49] going to be like in heaven brothers and
[38:51] sisters brother brandham says this is
[38:53] the quietest place we're ever going to
[38:55] be and I I just can't help but think you
[38:58] know God didn't give us talents and
[39:00] gifts just so that we could have them
[39:02] here did
[39:03] he because if you play the guitar here I
[39:06] can't help but think you'll probably
[39:07] play the guitar there gifts and callings
[39:10] are without repentance if you play the
[39:12] saxophone I can only imagine you're
[39:14] going to play a saxophone one day before
[39:16] God and I just think you do already when
[39:20] we when we when we bring our gifts
[39:22] together and we worship it might not be
[39:24] what we're used to but I guarantee you
[39:26] when we get over there it ain't going to
[39:27] be what we're used to brothers and
[39:29] sisters so why not start it
[39:33] here oh
[39:36] my now don't get tied down again by
[39:38] traditions and Creeds and
[39:41] organizations don't be led astray by
[39:44] listening to those that deny the power
[39:47] of the word and deny that Jesus saves
[39:50] heals and fills with the Holy Ghost and
[39:52] power you are God's free men loosed by
[39:56] his own blood if you still hold your
[39:59] faith to Creeds and denominations it is
[40:02] certain by the evidence that you have
[40:05] lost your faith in the
[40:08] word don't get bound down and you know
[40:11] what that's why I I just couldn't help
[40:12] but think about that brothers and
[40:13] sisters if we're not able to worship
[40:15] there's something wrong man there's
[40:17] something
[40:19] wrong who cares about anything else it's
[40:22] not about anybody else it's about you
[40:24] and God and are you going to say that
[40:26] something is going to hold my hands down
[40:28] and keep my voice quiet because you
[40:31] loose me from my sin but I just don't
[40:33] like the way they do something goodness
[40:35] sakes what's he going to say that day oh
[40:38] don't worry you can have a pass that's
[40:40] okay you don't have to worship me no his
[40:41] word says that if you don't worship me
[40:44] that the rocks will cry out
[40:48] immediately I think brother Ram he just
[40:50] says it here so clearly if you still
[40:51] hold your faith to Creeds and
[40:54] denominations remember brother Ken used
[40:56] to preach it all the time you could have
[40:57] a denomination of one I've got my ideas
[41:00] I live on my Island I've even got a flag
[41:02] I've got my position on the message of
[41:04] the hour and nobody can change me you
[41:07] know what you can have that all you want
[41:09] but brother bradam he says it here if
[41:11] you still hold your faith in Creeds and
[41:13] denominations it's certain by evidence
[41:16] that you have lost your faith in the
[41:17] word because remember going back to this
[41:21] paragraph I'm going to refer to this
[41:22] probably the entire time we talk about
[41:24] this book He said may God Begin by his
[41:28] Spirit to give us continuous lifegiving
[41:31] and prevailing
[41:33] Revelation all the way along brothers
[41:35] and sisters not just one time where I
[41:38] believe that I'm saved and I know the
[41:39] message of the hour
[41:41] no oh I can't help but preach sorry
[41:44] forgive me Kings and
[41:46] Priests I just want to pause here before
[41:49] we go too far I got a couple of quotes I
[41:51] have to bring just because I want to
[41:53] encourage us tonight brothers and
[41:54] sisters if we have been loose Lo from
[41:56] sin by his blood not ours by his if
[42:00] we've been loosed from our sin there is
[42:02] therefore when no condemnation not
[42:05] tomorrow not some other time and place
[42:07] right now you're already seated in
[42:09] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus doesn't
[42:12] matter what you've done in the past the
[42:13] only thing that matters is right now and
[42:15] moving forwards what's your
[42:18] desire is your desire to go in sin I am
[42:22] in church tonight but I just can't wait
[42:24] to get out and go and do that thing or
[42:27] whatever it is or or is it I just can't
[42:30] wait to go and look some of this up
[42:32] myself and and just get back into that
[42:34] thing that I was listening to and just
[42:36] continually have God reveal himself to
[42:39] me the seed of discrepancy in
[42:42] 1965 I in in the table it's paragraph 28
[42:46] so it's early in the message not even
[42:49] sin I'll just let them look that up not
[42:52] even sin in the seed of
[42:55] discrepancy
[42:57] not even sin is imputed to a genuine
[43:04] believer why is that brothers and
[43:06] sisters because we've been washed by his
[43:09] blood by that perfect blood by that
[43:12] perfect Sacrifice by God himself coming
[43:14] down and hanging one on Satan and
[43:16] showing him you're not smart enough to
[43:18] outsmart me because I'm God and you're
[43:21] not not even sin is imputed to a genuine
[43:25] believer amen did you know that he
[43:29] that's born of God does not commit sin
[43:33] he cannot sin see it's not even imputed
[43:38] why David said blessed is the man who
[43:40] God will not impute
[43:42] sin when you're in Christ you have no
[43:45] desire to
[43:47] sin thank you Lord such a beautiful
[43:49] thing we're talking about it this week
[43:51] you know I smoke as much as I want I
[43:53] drink as much as I want I listen to as
[43:55] much as I want I watch as much as I want
[43:57] I just don't
[43:59] want I I just want to Fellowship around
[44:01] the word of God because I know what he's
[44:03] done for me I know what I come from and
[44:06] I think it's so important for us to have
[44:08] an experience with God where we know
[44:11] what kind of a skunk we truly are when
[44:13] we really can see what kind of a
[44:16] scoundrel this guy can be you know what
[44:19] outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:20] we're a brute beast that's what brother
[44:22] bradam said and I'll say man and woman
[44:25] doesn't matter it's not exclusive to
[44:26] just one one gender no no no human
[44:29] beings outside of the baptism of the
[44:31] Holy Ghost we are a brute beast and
[44:34] until we have that realization it it can
[44:36] be really difficult to see where we've
[44:39] had that change in our lives but blessed
[44:41] is the man who God will not impute sin
[44:43] when you're in Christ you have no desire
[44:45] to sin the worshipper once purged has no
[44:48] more conscience of
[44:50] sin you don't desire
[44:53] it now to the world you might be a
[44:56] sinner but to God you're not because
[44:59] you're in Christ I remember coming to
[45:02] church initially and I was thinking my
[45:04] goodness how could I ever be this guy I
[45:07] don't know if I could ever be this guy
[45:08] because I've been that guy and I know
[45:10] who that guy is and I know the devil
[45:13] knows who that guy is and I know God
[45:14] knows who that guy is how could I ever
[45:16] be this guy that we're hearing about but
[45:20] you know the more that we feed upon the
[45:21] word brothers and sisters the more we
[45:23] become the word the more we recognize
[45:25] that we're not actually just becoming
[45:27] the word we are the word we're
[45:29] recognizing that we already were the
[45:32] word but you have no more conscience of
[45:35] sin it's the devil that comes around and
[45:37] says don't you remember you like that
[45:39] music you love that music don't you
[45:42] remember you like to go there you like
[45:44] to look at that you like to do this blah
[45:46] blah blah blah blah and we just need to
[45:48] say no no no no no that's the old man
[45:50] you know that's my past you're talking
[45:52] about buddy but you're not talking about
[45:54] my future my future is the word of God
[45:56] and hey why don't we go and talk about
[45:58] your future your future is Revelations
[46:00] 20:10 you'll be cast into the Lake of
[46:02] Fire how do you like that I like the
[46:05] sound of that and when we start to talk
[46:07] that way if you vocalize that brothers
[46:08] and sisters you'll cast those Devils out
[46:11] he'll be gone he doesn't want to hear
[46:12] nothing about that and that's where you
[46:14] get to the place where you become so
[46:16] hidden back in Christ where he can't
[46:19] even find you Satan can't even get
[46:22] you he doesn't want to deal with that
[46:24] why does he want to deal with that you
[46:26] don't have a conscience of sin you don't
[46:27] even have a remembrance of him anymore
[46:30] you don't desire it now to the world you
[46:33] might be a sinner but to God you're not
[46:35] because you're in Christ how can you be
[46:37] a sinner when you're in the sinless one
[46:41] and God only sees him whom you are
[46:46] in he only hears your voice and he wants
[46:50] to hear you
[46:51] worship and if you don't come to church
[46:53] on time how can you worship properly
[46:58] man it's not I don't even know why we
[47:00] keep going this way it's not about form
[47:02] to say I got to be at church exactly 30
[47:05] minutes before because that's what the
[47:07] prophet said if that's what you're doing
[47:09] stay
[47:10] home but if you want to come to church
[47:12] to worship and you understand that God
[47:14] through the prophet said if you come
[47:16] half an hour early in the age in which
[47:18] you live you're going to have enough
[47:19] time to get all the garbage out of your
[47:21] life and to allow you to just open
[47:23] yourself up to the spirit of God and
[47:25] then when you start to worship then
[47:27] you're going to start to Worship in
[47:28] spirit and in truth around the truth of
[47:31] the day the truth of the hour my
[47:34] goodness but if you don't come to church
[47:36] on time you just miss out on half the
[47:38] service brothers and sisters the
[47:39] preaching of the word is one thing but
[47:41] giving God glory I I would say is the
[47:44] greatest portion of the service
[47:45] Hallelujah yes the invisible Union of
[47:48] the bride of Christ
[47:50] 1965 very familiar quotes but I just
[47:53] thought they were so good we had to say
[47:55] them I couldn't not say him paragraph
[47:57] 265 you are the pure virtuous sinless
[48:03] bride
[48:04] you
[48:06] who you are the
[48:09] pure
[48:11] virtuous
[48:13] sinless Bride of the son of the Living
[48:24] God you are the pure
[48:28] virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the
[48:32] Living God we almost there there we go
[48:34] thank you Lord I just want to make sure
[48:37] we can read it too every man and woman
[48:40] that's born of the spirit of God and
[48:43] washed in
[48:44] what the blood of Jesus Christ which is
[48:47] God and believes every word of God
[48:51] stands as though you never sinned at the
[48:53] first place you're
[48:58] perfect let's just skip down a little
[49:00] bit brother Bram he says you're standing
[49:04] completely you never sinned at the first
[49:06] place isn't that
[49:08] beautiful remember brothers and sisters
[49:10] this isn't just a man that just rose up
[49:13] and had a great inspiration this is a
[49:14] Prophet this is a voice box of God God
[49:17] chose this man to fulfill this office
[49:19] the dispensational prophet to open his
[49:21] mouth and allow God to speak through him
[49:24] to have a prophetic utterance to this
[49:26] age so that we could actually comprehend
[49:29] what God's mind is God's expressing
[49:32] himself through this man to this
[49:33] generation you're standing completely
[49:36] you never sin at the first place God
[49:38] don't even know nothing it's in the sea
[49:41] of
[49:42] forgetfulness you never did it you were
[49:45] accused of it by the accuser but really
[49:48] from the beginning you were
[49:49] predestinated to be a son and daughter
[49:52] of God you're standing there washed and
[49:55] you're old book of divorcement is put
[49:57] away it's dead absolutely out of the
[49:59] existence even in the mind of
[50:02] God can you imagine that and yet so many
[50:06] times we live here and we toil even with
[50:08] the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we toil we
[50:10] struggle oh I did this oh I should have
[50:13] done that oh oh oh oh oh all these
[50:16] things in our
[50:17] lives but if we just listen to this this
[50:20] is what God is saying to us it's not a
[50:21] man it's God it's not just a good
[50:23] inspired service this is God speaking to
[50:26] a generation man your virtuous bride of
[50:29] Christ washed in the blood of Christ
[50:31] precious virtuous sinless Son of God
[50:35] standing with a pure unadulterated bride
[50:39] word that he Washed by the Water of his
[50:43] own blood that became flesh and
[50:47] manifested that he might take you which
[50:50] were predestinated in the bosom of the
[50:52] father before the beginning the same as
[50:56] he
[50:57] was he was that great attribute of God
[51:01] Called
[51:02] Love it's just so beautiful I had to I
[51:05] had to bring those out I don't know how
[51:08] far we're going to get here I had lofy
[51:12] expectations you know what it's so good
[51:14] it's so rich brothers and sisters you
[51:16] never did it in the first place don't
[51:17] let Satan come around and try and hang
[51:19] one on you just tell him to get lost in
[51:21] the name of Jesus Christ he has no power
[51:24] No Authority it's been
[51:27] stripped Kings and Priests brother
[51:29] bradam going on here he said and he hath

[51:39] his father to him be glory and Dominion

[51:45] verse
[51:47] 6 paragraph 122 he hath made us he did
[51:51] it oh there are certain truths we need
[51:54] to emphasize in this this is one of them
[51:56] he hath made us salvation is his doing
[51:59] salvation is of the Lord all of
[52:03] Grace he redeemed us for a purpose he
[52:06] bought us for a purpose we are Kings

[52:26] how many feels like they Reign Over a
[52:27] spiritual

[52:35] it by faith we believe it for If by one
[52:39] man's offense death Reign by one much
[52:42] more they which received abundance of
[52:45] Grace and of the gift of righteousness

[53:10] Flesh and the devil showing forth his
[53:14] praise and glory showing forth himself
[53:18] for it is Christ in US willing and doing
[53:21] of his own good pleasure yes indeed even
[53:24] now we are seated in Heavenly places in
[53:28] Christ
[53:29] Jesus I think it's so important to just
[53:33] dwell on that brothers and sisters we're
[53:35] already there and the devil's going to
[53:37] say well you prayed and God didn't
[53:39] answer it he didn't answer it the way
[53:40] that you wanted it and you know what
[53:42] it's not up to us to change God's mind I
[53:46] was listening to that over and over
[53:47] again today brother Bram he says it it's
[53:49] not the right way to pray don't try and
[53:52] get God to change his mind pray that God
[53:55] would change your mind pray that God
[53:57] would change our mind we need to come in
[53:59] line with his word we need to become
[54:01] subject to his word and when we do that
[54:04] something happens brothers and sisters
[54:06] we pray different we'll pray different
[54:08] not my will but thy will let let that
[54:11] happen let that be what comes to pass
[54:13] because we know that will change
[54:15] everything and made us priests yes
[54:19] priests unto him offering the spiritual
[54:23] Praise of sanctifying
[54:25] lips is he talking about the ministry
[54:28] here is what I was thinking when I was
[54:29] studying this is he talking about the
[54:30] ministry it's got to be about the
[54:32] ministry the five-fold ministry
[54:34] spiritual praise from Sanctified lips no
[54:40] it can't be just a Ministry it's the
[54:42] Bride of Jesus Christ it's every single
[54:45] person that comes and accepts him
[54:47] according to the basis of his word in
[54:49] this age according to the instruction
[54:51] that he gave unto the Prophet this
[54:53] dispensational Prophet we're talking
[54:54] about and hath made us priests yes
[54:57] priests unto him offering the spiritual
[55:00] Praise of Sanctified lips spending our
[55:03] lives as a sweet offering unto him
[55:07] worshiping him in spirit and in truth
[55:10] one of these days we're going to get
[55:11] into worshiping this the subject of
[55:14] worshiping and I'm going to preach my
[55:15] heart out about it brothers and sisters
[55:17] if I haven't already but I'm going to
[55:19] and you know we the people who
[55:22] understand this message of the hour who
[55:24] truly get the bap AP ISM of the Holy
[55:25] Spirit are able to Worship in spirit and
[55:28] anyone else without that true baptism of
[55:30] the Holy Spirit brothers and sisters
[55:32] they think they're worshiping god
[55:33] brother brandham says it very clearly
[55:35] God through the prophet says it very
[55:36] clearly they're not worshiping God
[55:38] they're worshiping Satan the God of this
[55:40] evil age and they think they're
[55:41] worshiping God and that's pretty strong
[55:44] but that's what he said not in this
[55:46] quote but that's what he said we have
[55:48] the ability to worship Him in spirit and
[55:50] in truth it's not an exclusive thing
[55:52] only if you just come and get baptized
[55:54] in the name name of the Lord Jesus
[55:55] Christ for the remission of your sins ye
[55:57] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[56:00] not one place that they baptize in the
[56:01] name of the father son the holy ghost in
[56:03] the Bible we know that but if we worship
[56:06] Him according to the spirit the holy
[56:08] spirit in US brothers and sisters then
[56:10] we already have the truth because we've
[56:13] accepted it so there is a group of
[56:14] people that will worship in spirit and
[56:17] in truth it's not just earnestly from
[56:19] your heart because you sincerely want to
[56:21] worship God you can sincerely do
[56:23] something and be sincerely
[56:27] wrong
[56:29] my I'm just got to start all over again
[56:32] and made us priest yes priests unto him
[56:34] offering the spiritual Praise of
[56:35] Sanctified lips spending our lives as a
[56:38] sweet offering unto him worshiping him
[56:40] in spirit and in truth interceding and
[56:43] petitioning priests and Kings unto our
[56:47] God no wonder the world does not appeal
[56:50] to us and we are A peculiar people
[56:52] zealous unto good works we we have been
[56:56] recreated in him to be children like
[56:59] unto our
[57:00] father this is just so rich my the
[57:04] coming of God behold he cometh with
[57:07] clouds and every eye shall see him and
[57:09] they also which pierced him and all
[57:11] kindreds of the Earth shall wail because
[57:13] of him even so amen Revelations
[57:16] 1:7 paragraph 125 he's coming Jesus is
[57:20] coming God is coming the prophet is
[57:23] coming the priest and King is coming the
[57:26] all in all is coming even so Lord Jesus
[57:29] come quickly amen he's coming he's
[57:32] coming in clouds Clouds Of Glory as when
[57:36] he was seen upon the Mount of
[57:38] transfiguration and his garments were
[57:40] shining as the power of God enfolded him
[57:44] and every eye shall see
[57:47] him that
[57:49] means this is not the Rapture Hallelujah
[57:53] very important to understand this
[57:55] brothers and sisters it's not the
[57:57] Rapture this is talking about
[57:58] Revelations 19 when we come back with
[58:02] him brother bradam says this means this
[58:05] is not the Rapture this is when he comes
[58:08] to take over his rightful place as World
[58:12] ruler this is when those who have
[58:14] pierced him with their Creeds and
[58:17] denominational doctrines shall mourn
[58:20] isn't that interesting it's not those
[58:22] that have pierced him with their spear
[58:24] in the side
[58:25] or or pierced his hands and his feet or
[58:27] or pierced his scalp with the crown of
[58:30] thorns it's not just the Jews isn't that
[58:33] interesting how he would say this those
[58:34] who have pierced him with their Creeds
[58:36] and their their dogmas their doctrines
[58:39] those ones that say this is how I
[58:41] believe it and I'm holding to it and I'm
[58:43] not willing to get that further
[58:44] Revelation my goodness brothers and
[58:46] sisters you don't have to be a Baptist
[58:48] to to do that you can Pierce him with
[58:50] your denominational doctrines and those
[58:53] people that pierced him with their
[58:55] Creeds and denominational doctrines
[58:57] shall mourn and all the people shall
[59:00] wail in Terror because of him who is the
[59:03] word paragraph 127 this is the
[59:06] Revelation story of Zachariah 129 to14
[59:11] Zachariah prophesied this about 2 200
[59:13] years ago it's just about to take place
[59:16] listen and it shall come to pass in that
[59:19] day that I will seek to destroy all the
[59:21] nations that come against Jerusalem
[59:26] look at what's happening over there how
[59:28] many nations are coming against
[59:29] Jerusalem my goodness and I will pour
[59:31] upon the House of David and upon the
[59:34] inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of
[59:36] Grace and of supplications and they
[59:39] shall look upon me whom they have
[59:42] pierced now brother
[59:44] bradam when is this gospel returning to
[59:47] the Jews when the day of the Gentiles is
[59:50] finished the gospel is ready to go back
[59:52] to the Jews here we have the prophet
[59:56] saying oh if I could just tell you
[59:57] something that's about to happen right
[1:00:00] in this our day what do you think he's
[1:00:02] going to say after what that sentence
[1:00:04] was just before that now when when is
[1:00:07] the gospel returning to the Jews when
[1:00:10] the day of the Gentiles is finished the
[1:00:12] gospel is ready to go back to the Jews
[1:00:15] oh if I could just tell you something
[1:00:17] that's about to happen right in this our
[1:00:19] day this great thing that's about to
[1:00:21] happen will carry over to Revelation 11
[1:00:24] and pick up those two witnesses those
[1:00:26] two prophets Moses and Elijah turning
[1:00:28] the gospel back to the Jews we're ready
[1:00:30] for it everything is in order this is
[1:00:33] 1960 he started in with this brothers
[1:00:35] and sisters here we are 2023 my as the
[1:00:39] Jews brought the message to the Gentiles
[1:00:41] even so the Gentiles will take it right
[1:00:43] back to the Jews and the Rapture will
[1:00:45] come that's a contested sentence in
[1:00:48] there some people say brother Bram
[1:00:49] changed his his approach to that that
[1:00:52] that maybe it's not going to be the the
[1:00:54] Gentiles it take it back to the Jews but
[1:00:56] I I I don't know I have my opinion of it
[1:00:58] I'm not going to say it one way or the
[1:00:59] other I just think it's interesting as
[1:01:01] the the Gentiles will take it right back
[1:01:03] to the Jews and the Rapture will come
[1:01:06] that's what he said now remember what we
[1:01:08] have read in Revelation and Zachariah
[1:01:11] both come right after the tribulation
[1:01:13] the Church of the firstborn does not go
[1:01:15] through the tribulation if you believe
[1:01:19] if you are the bride if you are the
[1:01:21] Church of the firstborn you do not go
[1:01:22] through the re the the the
[1:01:25] the tribulation he says we know that the
[1:01:27] Bible teaches that and at that time it
[1:01:31] says that God is going to pour out his
[1:01:33] Spirit upon the house of Israel it is
[1:01:35] the same spirit that was poured upon the
[1:01:38] Gentiles in their
[1:01:42] day I'm not saying it is but what I do
[1:01:44] want to say is if we ever want to see if
[1:01:46] God will pour out his Spirit just take a
[1:01:48] look at the Six Day War look up six- day
[1:01:50] war in Israel and you can see God pour
[1:01:53] out his spirit upon Israel the whole
[1:01:56] world came against Israel and Israel
[1:01:58] thumped them and that's there's no way
[1:02:00] that they should have been able to do
[1:02:01] that naturally speaking how could that
[1:02:03] happen he'll pour His Spirit out upon
[1:02:08] Israel so uh at that time it says that
[1:02:12] God is going to pour out his Spirit upon
[1:02:13] the house of Israel it's the same spirit
[1:02:15] that was poured upon the Gentiles in
[1:02:17] their
[1:02:18] day and they shall look upon me whom
[1:02:21] they have pierced and they shall mourn
[1:02:22] for him as one mourneth for his only son
[1:02:25] and they shall be in bitterness for him
[1:02:28] as one that is in bitterness for his
[1:02:31] firstborn in that day shall there be a
[1:02:34] great mour in Jerusalem as the mour of
[1:02:37] Hadad rimon in the valley of
[1:02:40] meiden and the land shall mourn every
[1:02:43] family apart the family of the House of
[1:02:45] David apart and their wives apart the
[1:02:47] family of the House of Nathan apart and
[1:02:49] their wives apart Zechariah 1210 to2
[1:02:53] brother Bram speaking he he says each
[1:02:54] one of the houses apart when he comes in
[1:02:58] clouds of Glory at his second coming
[1:03:01] those Jews that pierced him shall see
[1:03:04] him as it says in another
[1:03:07] scripture and one shall say unto him
[1:03:09] what are these wounds in thine hands
[1:03:13] then he shall
[1:03:15] answer those with which I was wounded in
[1:03:19] the house of my friends Zechariah
[1:03:22] 13:6 in the House of my friends those
[1:03:25] wounds remember those denominational
[1:03:27] Creeds and
[1:03:28] dogmas my
[1:03:30] goodness 132 not only will it be a
[1:03:34] mournful time for the Jews who rejected
[1:03:36] him as Messiah but it will be a mournful
[1:03:38] time for those left of the Gentiles who
[1:03:41] have rejected him as the savior of this
[1:03:44] day how do they reject him as as the
[1:03:46] savior of this day brothers and sisters
[1:03:48] to reject the prophet to reject the word
[1:03:52] of God that was given to this age
[1:03:55] by a prophetic utterance through a
[1:03:56] dispensational prophet that's identified
[1:03:58] in the word of
[1:04:01] God to reject that is to reject him to
[1:04:05] pierce him and you know this prophet he
[1:04:08] preached a sermon for God I just I'm
[1:04:10] just going to keep shining the light on
[1:04:11] it that way because I'm not trying to to
[1:04:14] uh just to be clear I don't want to
[1:04:15] belittle the prophet of God brother
[1:04:18] William Bram is our Prophet he's
[1:04:20] definitely our Prophet to this age but
[1:04:22] that Prophet was for a purpose and that
[1:04:24] was to get our attention on Christ the
[1:04:27] real Jesus Christ for our day brothers
[1:04:29] and sisters and it's only by the
[1:04:31] prophetic utterance that came through
[1:04:33] William Mary and bradam but he came for
[1:04:35] a purpose and that was to get our eyes
[1:04:37] on Jesus Christ and I know for sure that
[1:04:40] if he were to walk through those doors
[1:04:41] he would say Amen to those words because
[1:04:44] as soon as we try and put the attention
[1:04:46] on him he says you make me
[1:04:48] Antichrist I came to point to
[1:04:51] Christ but there's people in this
[1:04:54] message of the hour that will actually
[1:04:56] hold to their Creeds and their dogmas
[1:04:58] and they're going to pierce him through
[1:05:00] and we know this dispensational prophet
[1:05:02] he preached a sermon called indictment
[1:05:05] and he said God said through him I
[1:05:08] indict this generation for what the
[1:05:11] second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus
[1:05:13] Christ by rejecting him as the word when
[1:05:16] he came
[1:05:19] right 133 there will be weeping and
[1:05:22] wailing the sleeping virgin will be
[1:05:25] wailing they represent the church that
[1:05:27] refused to get oil the ones that didn't
[1:05:30] want to come to church and
[1:05:32] worship the sleeping virgins will be
[1:05:35] wailing they represent the church that
[1:05:37] refused to get oil symbol of the holy
[1:05:39] spirit in their lamps symbol of the body
[1:05:42] or holder of the oil until it was too
[1:05:45] late it wasn't that they were not good
[1:05:48] people they're great
[1:05:51] people they were virgins right virgins
[1:05:54] to the word they were virgins and that
[1:05:58] signifies a high moral
[1:06:00] order but they didn't have oil in their
[1:06:03] lamps so they were cast out where there
[1:06:05] was wailing and nashing of teeth and you
[1:06:08] know brothers and sisters the only way
[1:06:09] that I could see preaching this is I'm
[1:06:10] not preaching to the
[1:06:12] Baptists I'm not preaching to the
[1:06:15] Pentecostals right I'm preaching to the
[1:06:18] people that believe this message of the
[1:06:19] hour but we know there's three types of
[1:06:22] Believers and we know that it would be
[1:06:23] so close that it would deceive the very
[1:06:25] elected if it were possible so that
[1:06:27] means there's going to be a true vine
[1:06:29] and a false Vine and they're going to be
[1:06:31] just like this all the way to the very
[1:06:33] end brothers and sisters and the only
[1:06:34] thing we can do is preach the word of
[1:06:36] God hoping that it will chop to the
[1:06:38] heart of each and every individual so
[1:06:40] they will be able to get oil amen
[1:06:44] yes it wasn't that they weren't good
[1:06:46] people they were virgins and that
[1:06:48] signifies a high moral order they didn't
[1:06:50] have oil in their lamps so they were
[1:06:52] cast out where there was wailing and
[1:06:53] nashing of tee teeth let us type this
[1:06:56] all out of Genesis 45 where Joseph meets
[1:06:59] his brethren in Egypt and reveals
[1:07:01] himself to them then Joseph could not
[1:07:04] refrain himself before all them that
[1:07:07] stood by him and he cried cause every
[1:07:10] man to go out from me and there stood no
[1:07:13] man with him while Joseph made himself
[1:07:15] known to his Brethren and he wept aloud
[1:07:18] and the Egyptians and the house of
[1:07:20] pharaoh
[1:07:21] heard he must have cried pretty loud
[1:07:24] and Joseph said unto his Brethren I am
[1:07:26] Joseph doth my father yet live and his
[1:07:29] Brethren could not answer him for they
[1:07:31] were troubled at his presence what a
[1:07:33] powerful story this is and Joseph said
[1:07:36] unto his Brethren come near to me I pray
[1:07:39] you and they came near and he said I am
[1:07:42] Joseph your brother whom ye sold into
[1:07:45] Egypt now therefore be not grieved nor
[1:07:48] angry with yourselves that you sold me
[1:07:50] hither for God did send me before you to
[1:07:53] preserve Reserve
[1:07:55] Life for these two years hath the famine
[1:07:59] been in the land and yet there are five
[1:08:02] years in the which there shall neither
[1:08:05] be earring or harvest my this is just
[1:08:08] this is so good you know how you talk I
[1:08:11] talk about Revelation happening this is
[1:08:13] happening to me as I'm reading this to
[1:08:14] you right now it's so good so good my
[1:08:18] goodness I'm not going to go off on it
[1:08:20] because I'll I just want to get going
[1:08:21] here this is so good man I'm going to
[1:08:23] get back into this and God sent me
[1:08:25] before you to preserve you a posterity
[1:08:29] in the earth and to save your lives by a
[1:08:32] great Deliverance Genesis 45
[1:08:34] 1-7 he brother Bram he says now doesn't
[1:08:37] that compare with Zechariah 12 just
[1:08:39] beautifully putting the two together
[1:08:41] were bound to get it exactly right it
[1:08:44] has to be a word answer when Joseph was
[1:08:47] very young he was hated by his Brethren
[1:08:50] why was he hated by his Brethren it's
[1:08:53] because he was
[1:08:54] spiritual he couldn't help seeing those
[1:08:57] Visions nor could he help Dreaming
[1:08:59] Dreams and interpreting that was in him
[1:09:02] he could not display anything else but
[1:09:04] what was in him therefore when his
[1:09:07] brothers hated him it was without cause
[1:09:12] but he was the Beloved of the father of
[1:09:13] his father his father was a prophet and
[1:09:16] understood that makes a perfect type of
[1:09:19] Christ God the father loved his son but
[1:09:22] the Brethren scribes and Pharisees hated
[1:09:25] him because he could heal the sick do
[1:09:27] Miracles and foretell the future see
[1:09:29] visions and interpret
[1:09:31] them that was no reason to hate him but
[1:09:34] they did that's right and like Joseph's
[1:09:37] Brethren they hated him without a
[1:09:40] cause so beautiful how he just runs this
[1:09:43] parallel isn't it 137 now remember how
[1:09:47] those sons of Jacob treated Joseph they
[1:09:50] cast him into a pit they took his coat
[1:09:51] of many colors that his father had given
[1:09:53] give him and dipped it in blood to make
[1:09:56] his father think that the boy was killed
[1:09:58] by some
[1:09:59] animal they sold him to some slave
[1:10:01] traders who took him into Egypt and
[1:10:03] there he was resold to a general the
[1:10:05] General's wife had him falsely
[1:10:07] imprisoned but after some time his
[1:10:09] ability as a prophet brought him to the
[1:10:12] attention of pharaoh and he was exalted
[1:10:14] to the right hand of pharaoh with such
[1:10:17] Authority that none could approach
[1:10:19] Pharaoh unless he came first through
[1:10:22] Joseph
[1:10:24] now let us examine the life of Joseph
[1:10:26] while he was in Egypt for it is here we
[1:10:30] see him as the perfect type of Christ
[1:10:33] amen while in the house of the general
[1:10:36] he was falsely accused punished and in
[1:10:40] prison Without a Cause just like they
[1:10:42] did to Jesus there in prison he
[1:10:45] interpreted the dream of the Butler and
[1:10:47] the baker who were also prisoners with
[1:10:50] him the butler was restored to life but
[1:10:54] the other condemned to Death Christ was
[1:10:57] imprisoned on the cross forsaken by God
[1:10:59] and man on either side of him was a
[1:11:02] thief one died
[1:11:04] spiritually but the other was granted
[1:11:07] life and notice when Jesus was taken off
[1:11:10] the cross he was exalted into heaven and
[1:11:11] now sits at the right hand of the great
[1:11:14] spirit of Jehovah and no man can come to
[1:11:17] God except by
[1:11:19] him there is one mediator between God
[1:11:22] and Men and he is all you need there's
[1:11:25] no Martyrs Saints just
[1:11:27] Jesus keeping on with this type we find
[1:11:30] in Joseph notice how that everything he
[1:11:33] did in Egypt
[1:11:36] prospered his first job with the general
[1:11:39] prospered even the jail prospered when
[1:11:43] Jesus returns the desert will Blossom as
[1:11:46] a rose Hallelujah he is the son of
[1:11:50] prosperity I can only imagine that
[1:11:52] Joseph he must known how to
[1:11:56] worship no age has ever prospered as the
[1:11:59] one under Joseph so there is a time of
[1:12:02] such blessing coming on this Earth as
[1:12:05] the world has never
[1:12:07] known we can every one of us sit under
[1:12:12] our own fig tree and laugh and rejoice
[1:12:16] and live forever in his
[1:12:19] presence in his presence is fullness of
[1:12:22] joy
[1:12:24] and on his right hand there are
[1:12:25] Pleasures forever more praise
[1:12:28] God
[1:12:30] my we're getting there we're getting
[1:12:33] there but I don't know if we'll get all
[1:12:35] the way there now notice that everywhere
[1:12:37] Joseph went they sounded a trumpet to
[1:12:39] announce his arrival the people would
[1:12:41] scream bow the knee to Joseph no matter
[1:12:44] what a man was doing when that trumpet
[1:12:47] sounded he bowed the knee he could have
[1:12:49] been selling something in the street
[1:12:52] just reaching out for for his money but
[1:12:54] he had to stop and bend the knee when
[1:12:57] that trumpet blew if he were even a
[1:13:00] performer or an actor he would have to
[1:13:02] stop his act and bow the knee to Joseph
[1:13:05] when his presence was announced with
[1:13:08] that trumpet call and one of these days
[1:13:11] everything in time will stand still when
[1:13:14] the trumpet of God shall sound and the
[1:13:17] dead in Christ shall rise and morning
[1:13:19] will break Eternal bright and fair
[1:13:22] everything will bow the knee then for it
[1:13:25] was it is written wherefore God ha also
[1:13:28] hath highly exalted him and given him a
[1:13:31] name which is above every name that at
[1:13:33] the name of Jesus every knee should bow
[1:13:36] of things in heaven and things in the
[1:13:38] earth and things under the Earth and
[1:13:40] that every tongue should confess that
[1:13:42] Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God
[1:13:45] the Father Philippians 2:9
[1:13:48] to11 I just can't help but think
[1:13:50] brothers and sisters to to to to go back
[1:13:52] and say we we can every one of us sit
[1:13:54] under our own fig tree and laugh and
[1:13:55] rejoice and live forever in his presence
[1:13:57] that's a promise that's coming we're
[1:14:00] going to do
[1:14:01] that and when we get together in in
[1:14:04] church we know the word of God says
[1:14:06] where two or three are gathered together
[1:14:07] in my name what I'm there in the midst
[1:14:11] so when he's here in our midst we
[1:14:13] brothers and sisters should be
[1:14:15] worshiping him we should be bowing the
[1:14:17] knee to him and giving him absolute
[1:14:18] reverence in our lives and not letting
[1:14:21] anybody stand in our way maybe the sound
[1:14:22] guys put the sound too loud maybe the
[1:14:24] piano player pays it too too too fast or
[1:14:27] too slow or the song leader sings it
[1:14:29] whatever or the drums or whatever it is
[1:14:31] are you going to let something stand in
[1:14:33] the way of your worship to
[1:14:35] God I want to say don't do it don't do
[1:14:38] it amen paragraph
[1:14:40] 141 I'm sorry I just keep harping on
[1:14:43] that I I just yeah it's the Lord sorry
[1:14:46] um but notice another glorious
[1:14:47] Revelation in this typing of Joseph
[1:14:50] Joseph while in Egypt was given a
[1:14:52] gentile brother died and and through her
[1:14:56] he received a family of two sons Ephraim
[1:14:58] and Manasseh Joseph asked his father to
[1:15:01] bless the two boys he placed them in
[1:15:02] front of Jacob and so that Manasseh the
[1:15:05] firstborn would be on Jacob's right and
[1:15:07] Ephraim on his left as as Jacob was
[1:15:10] about to bless them he crossed his hands
[1:15:12] so the right hand fell upon the younger
[1:15:15] while Joseph cried out not so father
[1:15:19] this is the firstborn to your right but
[1:15:21] Jacob said God cross my hands
[1:15:23] here in type we see the blessing which
[1:15:25] belonged to the firstborn the Jew was
[1:15:28] given over to the younger the Gentile
[1:15:31] through the cross crossed hands of the
[1:15:34] Lord Jesus Christ The Blessing comes
[1:15:36] through the
[1:15:40] cross Galatians
[1:15:42] 3:13-14 Christ hath redeemed us from the
[1:15:45] curse of the law being made a curse for
[1:15:48] us my for it is written cursed is
[1:15:52] everyone that hangeth on a tree that The
[1:15:55] Blessing of Abraham might come on the
[1:15:57] Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we
[1:16:00] might receive the promise of the spirit
[1:16:03] through faith amen The Blessing of
[1:16:05] Abraham came through the cross of sorry
[1:16:09] The Blessing of Abraham came through the
[1:16:11] cross to the Gentiles the Jews rejected
[1:16:14] the cross therefore Jesus got the
[1:16:17] Gentile
[1:16:18] bride now getting back to the story of
[1:16:20] Joseph meeting his Brethren do you call
[1:16:24] that not all the Brethren came Joseph
[1:16:27] knew that and insisted that all the
[1:16:30] Brethren appear before him or that he
[1:16:33] could not make himself known unto them
[1:16:36] finally they brought the one that was
[1:16:38] missing little Benjamin it was Benjamin
[1:16:42] the full brother of Joseph that set his
[1:16:45] soul on
[1:16:48] fire
[1:16:50] Benjamin little Benjamin typifies the
[1:16:53] 144,000 Israelites from all over the
[1:16:57] Earth who have gone back to Palestine
[1:16:59] for their Redemption they will be
[1:17:02] standing there ready to receive him whom
[1:17:06] to
[1:17:07] know a right is life eternal they will
[1:17:11] say this is our God for whom we have
[1:17:15] waited then they will see him whom they
[1:17:18] have pierced and they will cry out in
[1:17:20] dismay where did did these off wounds
[1:17:23] come from how did it happen and they
[1:17:26] will wail and cry every family apart
[1:17:29] everyone apart in the agony of
[1:17:32] Sorrow now where will the Gentile Church
[1:17:35] be when Jesus is making himself known to
[1:17:37] his Brethren I think this is just so
[1:17:39] rich brothers and sisters where will the
[1:17:42] Gentile Church be he says remember that
[1:17:44] the Bride of Joseph with the two
[1:17:46] children were in the palace for Joseph
[1:17:49] had commanded let everyone leave me put
[1:17:52] them all fall out before me so the
[1:17:55] Gentile bride was hidden in the Palace
[1:17:57] of Joseph where will the Gentile Church
[1:18:00] go in the Rapture into the palace the
[1:18:04] bride will be taken off of the earth she
[1:18:07] will be caught up before the Great
[1:18:09] Tribulation to meet her Lord in the air
[1:18:12] for three and 1 half years while the
[1:18:16] retributive wrath of God is poured out
[1:18:19] she will be in the great marriage supper
[1:18:22] of the Lamb then he will then will he
[1:18:25] return leaving his bride in his father's
[1:18:27] house while he makes himself known to
[1:18:30] his Brethren I just think this is
[1:18:32] portion here is so rich because all of
[1:18:34] the struggles all the trials all the
[1:18:36] tribulations we don't have to have more
[1:18:39] we get a place of rest his bride just
[1:18:42] gets put at a very safe
[1:18:44] place 147 at this very time the
[1:18:47] Antichrist Covenant that the Jews have
[1:18:49] made with Rome will be broken Rome and
[1:18:52] her allies then send their troops to
[1:18:55] destroy all the God-fearing word abiding
[1:18:58] Jews but as they come against the city
[1:19:00] to destroy it there will appear in the
[1:19:03] heavens the sign of the coming of the
[1:19:06] son of man with his mighty armies to
[1:19:09] destroy them who have been destroying
[1:19:12] the Earth with the Enemy repulsed Jesus
[1:19:16] then comes and presents himself to the
[1:19:21] 144,000 having seen his Mighty acts of
[1:19:23] Salvation they have come to know his
[1:19:26] power but also seeing his wounds and
[1:19:29] knowing that they have rejected him even
[1:19:32] to that moment causes them to cry out in
[1:19:35] agony of Terror and fear even as did
[1:19:38] their Brethren of old when they stood
[1:19:41] before Joseph being sore afraid that
[1:19:44] they would be
[1:19:46] killed but as Joseph said don't be angry
[1:19:48] with yourselves it's all right God was
[1:19:50] in it all he did it to preserve deserve
[1:19:53] life even so will Jesus speak peace and
[1:19:57] love to
[1:19:58] them why did the Jews reject Jesus God
[1:20:01] was in it all
[1:20:03] my so that they would be blinded so that
[1:20:06] we could be
[1:20:07] here
[1:20:10] why why did the Jews reject Jesus God
[1:20:12] was in it all it was the only way that
[1:20:14] he could bring out the Gentile bride he
[1:20:17] died on the cross to preserve the life
[1:20:20] of the Gentile church amen
[1:20:24] now these 144,000 are not in the
[1:20:27] bride in Revelation 14:4 they are called
[1:20:31] virgins and they will follow the lamb
[1:20:33] withs soever he goeth the fact that they
[1:20:35] have not defiled themselves with women
[1:20:37] shows that they are Unix Matthew 19:12
[1:20:40] the unic were the keepers of the bridal
[1:20:42] Chambers they were attendants notice
[1:20:45] that they do not sit in the throne but
[1:20:48] are Before the Throne no they are not in
[1:20:51] the bride but will be in the Glorious
[1:20:54] Millennial
[1:20:56] Reign I I just as I studying this I just
[1:20:58] can't help but think you know I I'm
[1:21:00] going to want to go and shake some hands
[1:21:02] I'm going to want to go and and meet
[1:21:03] some people that had to go to owitz I
[1:21:06] want to go and meet some people that
[1:21:07] were blinded blinded when they cried out
[1:21:10] let let his blood be upon us and our
[1:21:13] children and set that murderer free let
[1:21:15] barabus go but put Jesus Christ on the
[1:21:17] cross I want to go and shake some hands
[1:21:19] for some people that didn't even hear
[1:21:21] those words that day but still fell
[1:21:23] under the curse of their forefathers oh
[1:21:26] my for me so that I could get the
[1:21:29] Salvation so that Jesus Christ goodness
[1:21:32] so he could go to the cross for me
[1:21:35] wow wow
[1:21:38] 151 we then see that when these last of
[1:21:42] Israel have been joined in love to the
[1:21:45] Lord and the enemy has been destroyed
[1:21:48] God will prepare his holy mountain and
[1:21:50] his new Garden of Eden for the bride
[1:21:52] died and his and her attendance for the
[1:21:55] Thousand-Year honeymoon upon the Earth
[1:21:59] anybody here ever gone on a honeymoon
[1:22:02] you're going to have a Thousand-Year
[1:22:03] honeymoon a Thousand-Year honeymoon upon
[1:22:06] the Earth as Adam and Eve were in the
[1:22:08] garden and did not finish out the
[1:22:10] Thousand Years now Jesus our last Adam
[1:22:13] and his Eve true church will fulfill all
[1:22:15] the plan of
[1:22:17] God and I I I've heard it said that you
[1:22:20] know God is going to take his bride and
[1:22:23] he's going to parade her before the
[1:22:25] devil for a thousand years because
[1:22:27] during that time he's going to be bound
[1:22:29] by chains of circumstance he's not going
[1:22:30] to be gone he won't be out of existence
[1:22:32] then he won't be annihilated yet he has
[1:22:35] to actually try and tempt the people
[1:22:36] that are still on the earth and he won't
[1:22:38] be able to touch the bride the bride
[1:22:40] will have a glorified body there will be
[1:22:42] no way that he can tempt her at
[1:22:45] all my oh how the Bible repeats itself
[1:22:49] the scene of Joseph and his Brethren is
[1:22:51] about to be repeated for Jesus is coming
[1:22:54] soon amen we did it my and as we leave
[1:22:59] the type of Joseph there is one more
[1:23:02] thing I want to bring to your attention
[1:23:04] about this end time you recall that
[1:23:07] Joseph stood before his Brethren when
[1:23:09] Benjamin was not with them he spoke
[1:23:12] through an interpreter I'll call the
[1:23:15] musicians as we wrap this up
[1:23:17] tonight he spoke through an
[1:23:20] interpreter though he knew the Hebrew
[1:23:22] well he spoke to his brethren in another
[1:23:26] tongue did you know that the first
[1:23:29] Gentile age the head of gold Babylonian
[1:23:33] age went out with a message in tongues
[1:23:36] written on a
[1:23:39] wall this age is going out the same way
[1:23:43] the abundance of tongues in this day is
[1:23:46] a further proof that the times of the
[1:23:49] Gentiles is over and God has turned
[1:23:52] turning back to
[1:23:54] Israel I don't know how many people here
[1:23:56] have seen speaking in tongues and
[1:23:58] interpretations it's real it
[1:24:01] happens we don't need to be afraid of it
[1:24:04] but there's a bunch of people that are
[1:24:05] majoring on it and we know that that's
[1:24:08] not the right way to go that's not the
[1:24:09] initial evidence of the Holy Ghost and
[1:24:11] that's what they put it all on but I I
[1:24:12] just think it's wonderful to look at it
[1:24:14] and here this this this this this
[1:24:17] depiction of what that
[1:24:19] means it's proof that the times of the
[1:24:22] Gentiles is over and God is turning back
[1:24:26] to
[1:24:27] Israel he's coming soon the Alpha and
[1:24:30] Omega the prophet priest and King the
