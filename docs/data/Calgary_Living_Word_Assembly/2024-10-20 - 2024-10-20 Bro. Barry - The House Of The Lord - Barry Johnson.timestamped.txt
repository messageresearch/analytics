[55:52] thank you
[55:53] musicians if you have your Bibles this
[55:55] morning I'd just like to to read from 1
[55:58] Peter chapter
[56:01] 3 1 Peter chapter
[56:06] 3 bit of an
[56:08] unusual direction
[56:12] today but we trust the Lord will bless
[56:15] it
[56:20] am certainly thankful for his
[56:23] grace my
[56:26] 1 Peter chapter 3 verse
[56:32] 1 it says likewise ye
[56:35] wives be in subjection to your own
[56:40] husbands that if any obey not the
[56:44] word they also May without the word be
[56:49] won by the conversation of the
[56:53] wives while they behold your Chase
[56:58] conversation coupled with
[57:00] fear whose adorning let it not be that
[57:04] outward
[57:05] adorning of ploting of hair and of
[57:09] wearing of
[57:10] gold or of putting on of
[57:14] apparel but let it be the hidden man of
[57:17] the heart in that which is not
[57:21] corruptible even the ornament of a Meek
[57:25] and quiet Spirit which is in the sight
[57:28] of God a great
[57:30] price for after this manner in the old
[57:34] time the holy women also who trusted in
[57:38] God adorned
[57:41] themselves being in subjection unto
[57:44] their own
[57:45] husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham
[57:50] calling him
[57:51] Lord whose daughters ye are as long as
[57:55] you do well and are not afraid with any
[58:01] amazement let's just bow in prayer one
[58:03] more
[58:04] time Heavenly Father Lord we pray that
[58:08] you would just bless this word father we
[58:11] know that it's your word that you've
[58:12] given to us father and we know that you
[58:14] have given all of your
[58:17] word for a purpose Lord for teaching for
[58:21] correction for leadership Lord for
[58:24] encouragement and we just invite you you
[58:26] Lord to take this word and allow it to
[58:28] be all those things father that today we
[58:31] would learn and grow that father we
[58:34] would not leave this building the same
[58:35] way that we came
[58:37] in we just pray that Lord you would just
[58:40] take us now by the hands and walk with
[58:43] us father let us walk with you Lord
[58:46] Jesus we just invite you now in Jesus
[58:49] Christ's name we pray amen God bless you
[58:52] this morning you may be seated
[58:56] just a couple of announcements we have
[58:58] uh the Youth Event this afternoon at the
[59:01] Clon residence and we're certainly
[59:02] excited to get together and have lunch
[59:06] and break bread we're also excited to
[59:09] hear what the Lord has placed on brother
[59:11] Jerry's heart brother Jerry Fox is with
[59:14] us from end time message
[59:15] Tabernacle and uh he's got I think a
[59:18] couple words of encouragement for us so
[59:20] we're certainly excited to hear what the
[59:21] Lord's placed on our brother's
[59:24] heart we're attempting to to uh actually
[59:27] we have brother ciz acuan here on the
[59:30] 27th of October that will be next Sunday
[59:34] we're excited to hear what the Lord has
[59:35] placed on his heart as well and uh we're
[59:38] attempting to secure a venue a gymnasium
[59:41] for the 31st but it's looking dismal it
[59:45] might not happen so in the event that
[59:47] doesn't happen we will certainly Open Up
[59:49] Our Place um either our house or the
[59:52] hall just for a place to get together
[59:54] for those people that want to on the
[59:56] 31st while the rest of the world goes
[59:58] and celebrates their own thing we can
[1:00:00] get together and just have a little bit
[1:00:02] of
[1:00:02] Fellowship um yeah and that's it for
[1:00:06] announcements
[1:00:07] today I'm certainly happy to be here and
[1:00:10] I know this is an interesting topic many
[1:00:14] times in the past we have talked a lot
[1:00:16] about husbands and today we just felt
[1:00:18] led to go down the road of wives and to
[1:00:21] talk about the sisters
[1:00:22] and I trust that it will be a blessing
[1:00:25] to us
[1:00:27] um many times it can seem uh really hard
[1:00:30] the scripture but we know that it's
[1:00:32] given to us for a purpose and we don't
[1:00:34] want to make excuses for the scripture
[1:00:37] we want to take the scripture and uh we
[1:00:39] want to apply it in our own lives that's
[1:00:41] the only way we're going to have success
[1:00:42] that's the only way we're going to be
[1:00:43] able to overcome the enemy in the day in
[1:00:45] which we live is to take the book and
[1:00:47] eat it and uh you know many times we can
[1:00:50] look at the word and we can look for all
[1:00:53] of the deep meanings and all of the
[1:00:55] Mysteries and talk about the seals and
[1:00:58] on and on and and there's nothing wrong
[1:01:00] with any of that I won't diminish any of
[1:01:02] it because it's all important it's all
[1:01:04] vital that's how we can look at the word
[1:01:06] that's how we're supposed to look at the
[1:01:08] word but sometimes I think it's
[1:01:11] important for us to just have a little
[1:01:12] bit of where the rubber meets the road
[1:01:14] so to speak where we're living right now
[1:01:17] today and that's where we want to go to
[1:01:21] and today I want to talk about this
[1:01:23] scripture that we've read out of First
[1:01:24] Peter chapter Chapter 3 The footnote in
[1:01:28] uh in my Bible at the top it says a Meek
[1:01:31] Spirit on this entire page and I think
[1:01:34] it's it's quite interesting that that's
[1:01:36] what it would say um I'm not making that
[1:01:40] my title but I'm just trying to set a
[1:01:42] bit of a background to show you where
[1:01:43] I'm coming from the Lord put a scripture
[1:01:45] on my heart and uh so I'm just following
[1:01:48] the Lord and uh I trust that it will be
[1:01:50] a blessing that he will take this word
[1:01:52] today and use it for us to uh allow us
[1:01:55] to grow and and to just be
[1:01:59] better while we go through this study
[1:02:02] this uh service today I just would like
[1:02:05] to remind us that as we speak about the
[1:02:09] wives here and we talk about the natural
[1:02:11] aspects of our lives and our wives we're
[1:02:14] also talking about his
[1:02:17] wife so we're not just talking about the
[1:02:19] females in the church even though we are
[1:02:22] and will we're talking about the
[1:02:23] brothers too because the brothers are
[1:02:26] real quick to say that I'm the Bride of
[1:02:27] Jesus Christ I'm his wife and we need to
[1:02:30] make sure that we're lining up with his
[1:02:31] word as his wife because our wives are
[1:02:35] only going to follow the word they're
[1:02:37] only going to follow us the way we
[1:02:40] follow
[1:02:41] Christ and if we're not following Christ
[1:02:43] properly in our life then she ain't
[1:02:45] going to do it in her own life but it's
[1:02:47] interesting because the word of God says
[1:02:49] that even she can do something about it
[1:02:53] not by actually getting angry and
[1:02:55] calling her husband out when he's not in
[1:02:57] the word but she can actually change the
[1:03:00] circumstances herself by following the
[1:03:03] word what a tremendous blessing that is
[1:03:06] even when he does her wrong she still
[1:03:11] can make the choice to actually talk
[1:03:14] smack about her husband to her friends
[1:03:16] to her brothers to her sisters maybe to
[1:03:18] co-workers whatever it is or she can
[1:03:21] actually have a conversation that talks
[1:03:23] good about her husband and causes her
[1:03:25] husband to receive a
[1:03:28] blessing and what happens is it changes
[1:03:30] the circumstances in their home in their
[1:03:33] lives but in our scripture today
[1:03:36] likewise I'll just read it again
[1:03:38] likewise 1 Peter chapter 3:1 likewise he
[1:03:41] wives be in subjection to your own
[1:03:43] husbands Brothers and Sisters Let's be
[1:03:46] in sub be subject to our husband the
[1:03:48] Lord Jesus Christ that if any not obey
[1:03:51] not the word they also May without the
[1:03:55] word be won by the conversation of the
[1:03:57] wives Now isn't it interesting because I
[1:04:00] believe we can actually take and and
[1:04:02] talk about our brothers and our sisters
[1:04:03] and and say maybe this brother's off and
[1:04:06] this sister's off and look at their
[1:04:07] behavior and look at that or brothers
[1:04:09] and sisters we have the opportunity to
[1:04:11] talk good about that brother and sister
[1:04:14] to say maybe they have something in
[1:04:16] their life maybe there's something
[1:04:18] that's caused them to behave the way
[1:04:20] they are and they just don't know maybe
[1:04:22] they're just under the influence of
[1:04:24] something maybe they're being afflicted
[1:04:25] by something maybe we don't understand
[1:04:28] their circumstances their situation we
[1:04:31] have the ability to change the
[1:04:33] conversation is what I'm getting at
[1:04:36] verse two says while they behold your
[1:04:39] chaste conversation coupled with
[1:04:42] fear
[1:04:44] my verse three is the scripture that the
[1:04:46] Lord I believe spoke to me on and uh you
[1:04:49] know I like to go back and forth when I
[1:04:52] do get a verse but verse three says
[1:04:54] who's adorning let it not that outward
[1:04:56] adorning of pling of the hair and of
[1:05:00] wearing gold or of putting on
[1:05:03] apparel it's not an outward expression
[1:05:06] that we're trying to present to the
[1:05:07] world it's not a whitewash is it we know
[1:05:11] that brother bradam said it we need to
[1:05:13] be washed white not just on the outside
[1:05:16] whitewashed not not doing our hair
[1:05:19] really fancy and and the plating of hair
[1:05:22] I looked it up and and this is not
[1:05:23] specific about anyone just for the
[1:05:25] record
[1:05:26] plating of hair is braids many braids
[1:05:29] and it's a wonderful thing but what I
[1:05:31] want to say is if that was all we had
[1:05:35] what would we
[1:05:37] have but we go a little bit further we
[1:05:39] can see that it's not the plating of
[1:05:41] hair it's not how we do our hair it's
[1:05:43] not talking about cutting hair we'll get
[1:05:44] to that but it's how we do our hair it's
[1:05:47] not the way we do our hair that makes us
[1:05:49] saved that shows that we're
[1:05:51] Believers that's not it it's not the
[1:05:54] wearing of gold jewelry we were talking
[1:05:56] to Brother John and and sister namita
[1:05:58] about the class system in India and the
[1:06:01] more gold you have the better you
[1:06:04] are and that's not it either it's not
[1:06:06] wearing of jewelry it's not the outward
[1:06:09] appearance it's not adorning uh the
[1:06:12] outward appearance plating of hair and
[1:06:13] wearing of gold or putting on of apparel
[1:06:16] putting on the Babylonian garment we
[1:06:18] talked about that in uh the story of aen
[1:06:22] he wanted that Babylonian garment and
[1:06:25] and we don't we don't look at it that
[1:06:26] way that's not what's going to do it for
[1:06:28] us verse four is the key but let it be
[1:06:32] the hidden man of the
[1:06:34] heart and isn't it interesting that it
[1:06:37] would say the hidden man of the
[1:06:40] heart not the hidden woman because I
[1:06:43] thought he was talking about wives was
[1:06:45] he talking about wives he's just talking
[1:06:46] about wives remember we're talking about
[1:06:49] his wife
[1:06:51] too and and we know that Ephesians
[1:06:53] chapter 5 I'm going to get there jumping
[1:06:55] ahead now like usual but isn't it
[1:06:57] interesting because he said Paul said I
[1:06:59] I speak concerning a mystery between
[1:07:02] Christ and the church the two become one
[1:07:05] and they don't become her they become
[1:07:08] him so here we have the scripture saying
[1:07:11] let it be the hidden man Jesus Christ
[1:07:15] the same yesterday today and forever the
[1:07:17] invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus
[1:07:21] Christ but what happens is that
[1:07:23] invisible Union causes something
[1:07:25] invisible to happen am sometimes in our
[1:07:28] lives I think we can get caught up in
[1:07:29] talking about the invisible Union and
[1:07:31] saying amen bless God I'm I'm invisibly
[1:07:34] unionized with the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:07:36] still live like the rest of the
[1:07:38] world just because we know a quote
[1:07:40] doesn't mean we're
[1:07:42] saved but let it be the hidden man Jesus
[1:07:45] Christ of the heart in that which is not
[1:07:49] corruptible that's where I want to draw
[1:07:51] the the the identity here this is
[1:07:54] there's only one thing that's not
[1:07:55] corruptible we know that that's the Lord
[1:07:57] Jesus Christ God himself Elohim even the
[1:08:00] ornament of a what of a Meek and quiet
[1:08:06] Spirit now we can talk about wives and
[1:08:09] how they ought to have a Meek and quiet
[1:08:11] spirit and I'm sure we could get a an
[1:08:13] amen out of all the brothers maybe if
[1:08:15] the sisters weren't in the
[1:08:18] room
[1:08:20] right but that's that's what the word
[1:08:22] says that that it shouldn't be the way
[1:08:24] we dress shouldn't be the perfume we
[1:08:27] wear it shouldn't be the things that we
[1:08:29] do on the outside that it should be from
[1:08:31] the inside that
[1:08:33] manifests but it's not just about the
[1:08:35] wives it's about his wife we ought to
[1:08:38] have a Meek and quiet Spirit also not
[1:08:42] always needing to get the last word not
[1:08:44] always needing to be the one who's right
[1:08:47] as brothers and sisters we ought to be
[1:08:50] encouraging one
[1:08:51] another we ought to be kind and
[1:08:55] tenderhearted according to the word but
[1:08:58] let it be the hidden man of the heart in
[1:09:00] that which is not corruptible even the
[1:09:02] ornament of a Meek and quiet
[1:09:06] Spirit which is in the sight of
[1:09:09] God of a great
[1:09:12] price as as I was studying this I just I
[1:09:15] really like to think about it in in many
[1:09:16] different aspects but where is the sight
[1:09:20] of
[1:09:20] God where's the sight of
[1:09:24] God we've said it many times in the past
[1:09:26] and I know people are probably getting
[1:09:28] tired of hearing me say it that way but
[1:09:30] you know the sight of God is in our
[1:09:31] brother and our
[1:09:33] sister his eyes are all throughout the
[1:09:35] world we know that he he's God he can do
[1:09:38] anything he wants but he chooses to work
[1:09:40] through men is that right that's what
[1:09:42] the prophet said he chooses to work
[1:09:45] through men so he's actually going up
[1:09:48] and down through the Earth looking at
[1:09:50] all of the different situations through
[1:09:51] brothers and sisters eyes he's listening
[1:09:54] with brothers and sisters ears
[1:09:57] and he's listening to the conversation
[1:09:58] that we're
[1:10:00] having but it's in the sight of God a
[1:10:04] great price for after this manner in the
[1:10:07] old time the holy women also who trusted
[1:10:09] in God adorned themselves being in
[1:10:11] subjection unto their own
[1:10:14] husbands so looking at this they were
[1:10:18] Sub in subjection to their own husbands
[1:10:20] it doesn't look like they were actually
[1:10:21] forced to be in subjection to their own
[1:10:23] husbands and some might say wow there
[1:10:25] was some pretty hard task Masters back
[1:10:27] in the day and wives were just property
[1:10:30] and more like slaves and on and on and
[1:10:33] that's true but that's not what the word
[1:10:35] is saying here the word is saying that
[1:10:37] they they being in subjection un unto
[1:10:41] their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed
[1:10:46] Abraham calling him Lord she didn't have
[1:10:48] to call him Lord do you think Abraham
[1:10:51] beat her until she called him Lord
[1:10:55] Abraham loved
[1:10:57] her and she called him
[1:10:59] Lord even as Sarah obeyed Abraham
[1:11:03] calling him Lord whose daughters ye are
[1:11:06] as long as ye do well and are not afraid
[1:11:10] with any
[1:11:12] amazement and that word amazement in my
[1:11:15] Bible says sudden
[1:11:17] Calamity we can have sudden calamities
[1:11:20] I'm not going to go on to verse S
[1:11:21] talking about husbands I don't want to
[1:11:22] do that today I want to talk about the
[1:11:24] wives the sisters in our our church in
[1:11:27] our lives it's so incredible to look at
[1:11:30] this I think it's just a wonderful thing
[1:11:33] whose adorning let it not be that
[1:11:35] outward adorning of plating of the hair
[1:11:38] and of wearing of gold and putting on
[1:11:39] apparel not the outward appearance but
[1:11:42] let it be the man of the heart in that
[1:11:45] which is not corruptible even the
[1:11:47] ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit
[1:11:49] which is in the sight of God a great
[1:11:51] price that that spirit that he's looking
[1:11:54] for is his own spirit
[1:11:55] it's a wonderful thing we don't have to
[1:11:57] try and find a way I'm telling you if
[1:12:00] we're trying to find a way to live our
[1:12:02] live our lives with a a Meek and a quiet
[1:12:05] Spirit we've got it wrong we're
[1:12:07] impersonating Christianity what we need
[1:12:10] to do is get the Holy Ghost in our life
[1:12:12] when we get the Holy Ghost in our life
[1:12:14] that is what we are going to project now
[1:12:16] some people are going to argue and say
[1:12:18] brother Barry that's not possible don't
[1:12:19] you know my genetics my genetics are
[1:12:21] like this and maybe they will be but we
[1:12:23] will always come subject to the word of
[1:12:26] God if we've got the Holy Ghost if we
[1:12:29] don't come subject to the word of God
[1:12:31] I'm going to say it straight you don't
[1:12:32] got the Holy
[1:12:34] Ghost it's one or the other I say Lord
[1:12:38] help me I'm not throwing off on anyone I
[1:12:41] just know that he led me this way and
[1:12:42] the only thing I can do is just follow
[1:12:44] him just allow him we need to make sure
[1:12:47] that it's not just our adorning we can
[1:12:49] come to church on time we can part our
[1:12:51] hair just right we can say the right
[1:12:54] things we can sing is
[1:12:56] right but do we have that hidden man in
[1:13:00] the heart or are we quick to just go and
[1:13:02] have a conversation and just talk smack
[1:13:04] about that brother do you know about
[1:13:06] that brother what that brother's done do
[1:13:07] you know what that sister does are we
[1:13:09] doing that that's not that Incorruptible
[1:13:13] man that's another
[1:13:16] spirit and we need to repent for
[1:13:20] it our adorning on the outside is just a
[1:13:23] whitewash
[1:13:25] that's all it is it's just a
[1:13:27] whitewash but it needs to be that hidden
[1:13:30] man in the heart that only one that's
[1:13:33] incorruptable and it's an
[1:13:35] ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit you
[1:13:39] know what that is that's a gem I'm going
[1:13:41] to say it this way this is Brother
[1:13:42] Barry's interpretation when I hear that
[1:13:44] word ornament it makes me think it's a
[1:13:45] gem in his
[1:13:47] crown that's what we are brothers and
[1:13:49] sisters were gems in his crown we know
[1:13:51] that's what the word says but what does
[1:13:54] that it's actually that life of Jesus
[1:13:58] Christ Living out through us and there's
[1:13:59] no way we're ever going to be able to
[1:14:01] hold tow that line we'll never be able
[1:14:04] to live with a Meek and quiet Spirit
[1:14:07] properly on our
[1:14:09] own and so to this morning while we're
[1:14:12] here I just was thinking about this and
[1:14:15] and another scripture came to mind
[1:14:17] second Peter chapter 3 let's turn there
[1:14:19] second Peter chapter 3 if you don't mind
[1:14:20] just a couple pages over second Peter
[1:14:23] chapter 3
[1:14:27] Paul the Apostle the first church age
[1:14:30] messenger setting the pattern for all
[1:14:33] other Church
[1:14:36] ages in second Peter chapter 3 in verse
[1:14:39] one he says this epistle beloved I now
[1:14:42] write unto you and we know that that he
[1:14:46] was speaking to a specific group of
[1:14:48] people and and I'm I want to say I'm so
[1:14:50] glad that I can say I'm one of them when
[1:14:52] I see that you there I say he's talking
[1:14:55] to me this Second Epistle beloved I now
[1:14:59] write unto you in both which I stir up
[1:15:02] your pure Minds by way of remembrance
[1:15:05] what's our Pure mind there's only one
[1:15:08] mind that's pure and that's that
[1:15:10] Incorruptible man that that one that's
[1:15:12] on the inside with a a Meek and quiet
[1:15:15] Spirit that's Jesus Christ our Pure Mind
[1:15:18] by way of remembrance that ye may be
[1:15:22] mindful mindful not just simply aware
[1:15:26] I've got it somewhere in a quote in a
[1:15:28] book maybe I've made a note I heard it
[1:15:30] somewhere no it's it's mindful it's our
[1:15:33] minds are full of what he's talking
[1:15:36] about here that ye may be mindful of The
[1:15:39] Words which were spoken before by the
[1:15:42] holy
[1:15:44] prophets and of the Commandment of us
[1:15:48] the Apostles of the Lord and
[1:15:50] Savior and we know that it goes on to
[1:15:52] talk about the day of the Lord I don't
[1:15:54] want to go there I just want to say that
[1:15:56] he he gave us this scripture for a
[1:15:58] purpose this this this scripture that
[1:16:00] we're reading today the the First Peter
[1:16:04] chapter 3 second Peter chapter 3 this
[1:16:09] scripture is given to us to stir up our
[1:16:11] Pure Minds that that man that inner man
[1:16:14] that lives inside of us to stir him up a
[1:16:17] little bit in our lives to to make us
[1:16:19] think about our lives to make us
[1:16:21] consider our ways how are we conducting
[1:16:24] ourselves as the Believers of the
[1:16:26] greatest message that's ever struck the
[1:16:28] Earth Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:16:30] today and forever we know that all other
[1:16:32] Church ages had a portion but they never
[1:16:35] had the
[1:16:36] whole even when the apostles were here
[1:16:39] they had Jesus the Nazarene they had
[1:16:42] Jesus Christ until he died was buried
[1:16:47] and rose again and he came back and and
[1:16:50] just gave him a little tiny bit of
[1:16:52] encouragement before he went up we know
[1:16:55] that but then he gave a little portion
[1:16:58] of himself to every single age a little
[1:17:00] dispensation of Grace that Grace that
[1:17:03] walked in and pleaded our case just a
[1:17:05] little dispensation a little
[1:17:06] dispensation seven times until he got to
[1:17:09] the seventh one and now we have the
[1:17:11] fullness of the word in our lives that
[1:17:15] is the man we're talking about today the
[1:17:17] fullness of the message of the hour
[1:17:18] Jesus Christ the fullness not just a
[1:17:22] portion but here here he's trying to
[1:17:24] stir up our Pure Minds by way of
[1:17:27] remembrance that we may be mindful of
[1:17:29] The Words which were spoken before by
[1:17:32] the holy prophets and today I just want
[1:17:33] to say this I don't want to change the
[1:17:35] word of God but I just would like to
[1:17:36] maybe substitute this just for a second
[1:17:38] for the the sake of illustration to say
[1:17:40] the holy prophet in our day to stir up
[1:17:44] our minds that we may be mindful of The
[1:17:47] Words which were spoken before by the
[1:17:50] holy prophet in our day and of the
[1:17:52] Commandment of us and the Apostles of
[1:17:54] the Lord and savior we know that William
[1:17:56] Mary and brandom he never brought his
[1:17:57] own word the only thing he did was point
[1:18:00] back to the
[1:18:02] word and to highlight the word and to
[1:18:05] break it open and tie up the Loose Ends
[1:18:07] and make it all one word without a whole
[1:18:10] bunch of
[1:18:13] controversy today where I want to go to
[1:18:15] brothers and sisters I would like to
[1:18:17] talk a little bit about the house of the
[1:18:19] Lord a and about being around our
[1:18:22] Believers our brothers and our sisters
[1:18:24] in the the house of the Lord I I think
[1:18:27] it's a beautiful place this is a sacred
[1:18:30] place this church not this building
[1:18:33] necessarily when we all come together in
[1:18:35] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ This
[1:18:37] is a sacred place we know that's the
[1:18:40] only provided place of worship given to
[1:18:42] us in this age in Jesus Christ we know
[1:18:46] that there's only one age that Satan is
[1:18:48] the god of the age and that is this age
[1:18:51] the prophet in our day declared that but
[1:18:54] this ought to be the safest place that
[1:18:57] we could ever come to the house of the
[1:19:00] Lord where we gather together with our
[1:19:02] brothers and our
[1:19:04] sisters and you know I just think that
[1:19:07] we need to get into a little bit of
[1:19:10] maybe housekeeping items there's some
[1:19:13] things that maybe we just need to
[1:19:14] consider how sacred this place really
[1:19:19] is sometimes we can just maybe forget
[1:19:23] about how sacred this place place is
[1:19:25] let's take a step back and look at the
[1:19:27] Tabernacle in the wilderness we know
[1:19:30] that picture we've had it brought up
[1:19:31] many times I don't even know if it's
[1:19:33] convenient there now if it is it might
[1:19:35] be good to bring it up the Tabernacle in
[1:19:37] the wilderness we know that there is the
[1:19:40] the fence on the outside there's the
[1:19:42] outer Court that's called then there's
[1:19:44] the inner chamber but then there's
[1:19:46] another place that's behind the very
[1:19:48] back Veil and and that's the holy of
[1:19:51] holies the holy place that's the place
[1:19:55] where the priest was able to enter one
[1:19:57] time in a year to make the ultimate
[1:20:00] sacrifice for the children of Israel and
[1:20:03] and we know that if he went into that
[1:20:05] building one iota off from what the word
[1:20:08] instructed him to be on they drug him
[1:20:11] out by the cord that was tied to his
[1:20:14] ankle because he wasn't
[1:20:16] righteous and so I just want to say
[1:20:20] brothers and sisters do we actually see
[1:20:23] this Gathering here like this to be like
[1:20:26] that or is this just another gathering
[1:20:29] at a church building somewhere in
[1:20:30] southeast Calgary where the air is a bit
[1:20:32] stinky and lots of bugs is is it just
[1:20:36] the natural things that we're looking at
[1:20:37] or do we actually sense the presence of
[1:20:40] almighty God because when we walk
[1:20:43] through those doors brothers and sisters
[1:20:45] some people are just coming in and
[1:20:47] plunking down in a church building and
[1:20:50] that's it other people are coming and
[1:20:53] walking beyond that inner Veil and going
[1:20:56] into the holy of
[1:21:00] holies and I want to say I encourage
[1:21:04] everyone to look at this building as
[1:21:06] going Beyond the Veil into the holy of
[1:21:11] holies I don't know I I all of this is
[1:21:16] unscripted it's interesting I love it
[1:21:18] the way the Lord leads you know there's
[1:21:20] many things that go on inside this
[1:21:22] building that are kind of surprising at
[1:21:24] times
[1:21:25] that are actually contrary to what the
[1:21:26] prophet said and and it happens and you
[1:21:30] know what I can say I'm guilty but I
[1:21:32] that's why I think maybe today I just
[1:21:34] wanted to I felt led to go down this
[1:21:36] road of maybe just a little housekeeping
[1:21:38] a little stirring up our Pure Minds the
[1:21:40] mind of the lord inside of us by way of
[1:21:43] remembrance to say hey wait a second
[1:21:44] yeah the prophet did say that maybe I
[1:21:46] forgot about it in case anybody didn't
[1:21:48] know I'll tell you this the priest the
[1:21:51] high priest did not go in behind that
[1:21:53] inner Veil
[1:21:55] and clip his
[1:21:57] fingernails he wasn't in that inner Veil
[1:21:59] clipping his
[1:22:01] fingernails so I want to recommend don't
[1:22:04] clip your fingernails in the Church of
[1:22:06] the Living
[1:22:07] God it might not bother you but it can
[1:22:10] certainly bother someone else and I
[1:22:12] guarantee you it bothers him because
[1:22:15] we're not reverencing this place and
[1:22:18] like I said it's not the building so
[1:22:20] much as it is the people gathered
[1:22:22] together in the building so sometimes we
[1:22:25] let our children just make
[1:22:27] noise sometimes our children I don't
[1:22:30] have something here will just
[1:22:32] have I maybe this will
[1:22:38] work you just be trying to listen to the
[1:22:40] preaching of the word and a child will
[1:22:42] just be like
[1:22:44] this and and I just want to say where's
[1:22:46] the parents let's going
[1:22:49] on we can be doing things that are
[1:22:52] distracting to other people
[1:22:55] sometimes children are moving around
[1:22:58] sometimes there's different things
[1:22:59] happening as parents it's our
[1:23:00] responsibility to make sure that we are
[1:23:03] governing this it's not the Deacon's
[1:23:05] responsibility to say you shouldn't do
[1:23:08] that in the house of the Lord you
[1:23:09] shouldn't do that in the house of the
[1:23:10] Lord we should be teaching our children
[1:23:13] at
[1:23:13] home the Holiness of this Gathering that
[1:23:17] we're meeting with allmighty
[1:23:20] God this is not playtime
[1:23:24] this is the house of the Living
[1:23:31] God the priest didn't go and clip his
[1:23:36] fingernails wonder why I'm saying that
[1:23:38] when we do the house cleaning in here we
[1:23:39] found
[1:23:41] fingernails and I know in the past I've
[1:23:43] heard clipping I've heard
[1:23:46] it years ago not now when I'm up here
[1:23:50] Not much bothers me to be honest with
[1:23:52] you it really there's not much that bugs
[1:23:54] me up here and I think it's wonderful
[1:23:56] but when I sit and I try and listen if
[1:23:58] there is a minister ministering and
[1:24:00] sometimes you just I I don't know Wonder
[1:24:03] where's the parents are the parents
[1:24:05] there do they hear it but I know what
[1:24:07] happens brothers and sisters because I'm
[1:24:09] a parent and I'm not going to throw off
[1:24:11] on parents because we have to have
[1:24:13] parents because we have to have children
[1:24:16] if we're going to see this message go on
[1:24:17] should the Lord Terry who is going to
[1:24:19] pick up the Baton and go forwards with
[1:24:21] it there has to be children
[1:24:25] we're supposed to go forwards and have
[1:24:28] children that is what the scripture says
[1:24:29] the two become one and that is the fruit
[1:24:33] of their
[1:24:35] Union we have to have children children
[1:24:38] need to come to the house of the Lord we
[1:24:40] want to encourage that but we also don't
[1:24:42] want to make this the training room we
[1:24:44] want to make it a place where we can
[1:24:45] worship where the children understand
[1:24:47] that there's reverence there has to be
[1:24:49] holy reverence in this building it's the
[1:24:52] same God that was behind that fail
[1:24:55] either it is or it
[1:24:57] isn't we can say well it's different
[1:24:59] today is it isn't it Hebrews 138 Jesus
[1:25:03] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:25:04] forever Jesus is not a different person
[1:25:07] from that God that was behind that inner
[1:25:08] Veil if we do that we're going to make
[1:25:11] them a second or third person don't do
[1:25:14] that the house of the Lord ought to be
[1:25:17] the safest place that we can come
[1:25:19] to to worship to feed upon the word
[1:25:24] to encourage our brothers and sisters to
[1:25:26] receive encouragement from our brothers
[1:25:29] and sisters I heard it one time I
[1:25:30] thought it was so good I'll say it this
[1:25:32] way Adrien Rogers he said it he's not a
[1:25:36] message believer I don't think but he's
[1:25:38] a good preacher but he said you know
[1:25:40] going to church on Sunday isn't all
[1:25:43] about you what can I get out of church
[1:25:45] today what is the preacher going to
[1:25:47] preach sometimes it's about bringing
[1:25:49] yourself so you can be an encouragement
[1:25:51] to others
[1:25:54] yes when your brother and sister is
[1:25:56] feeling like I could just barely make it
[1:25:58] I don't know if I could stand another
[1:26:00] day but I'm going to go and so they get
[1:26:04] there and they're down in their heart
[1:26:06] they're down in their mind down in their
[1:26:09] spirit and they just need something and
[1:26:11] there's one brother there that just
[1:26:13] shakes their hand in just a different
[1:26:15] way and says God bless you in such a way
[1:26:17] that they feel appreciated and that is
[1:26:20] all it takes sometimes to take somebody
[1:26:22] to that next level
[1:26:25] when all the devils are weighing down
[1:26:27] their arms and weighing down their heart
[1:26:30] they can get that handshake out there in
[1:26:32] the foyer or downstairs or in the
[1:26:34] parking lot and they come into the
[1:26:35] service and some of those Devils fall
[1:26:38] off and when the singing starts to
[1:26:41] happen something happens and suddenly
[1:26:43] those Devils fall off alog together and
[1:26:45] they don't care who's looking and they
[1:26:47] can start to worship God the way that he
[1:26:50] desires to be
[1:26:52] worshiped the high priest did didn't go
[1:26:54] back behind that inner Veil and say
[1:26:59] wow I've heard that
[1:27:02] before you ain't going to teach me
[1:27:04] nothing I ain't never
[1:27:06] heard I've been in the message way
[1:27:08] longer than you've ever been
[1:27:11] around he didn't do that he went back
[1:27:14] there with total reverence because he
[1:27:16] didn't come to see anyone else except
[1:27:18] for almighty God the house of the Lord
[1:27:22] ought to be the safest place for us to
[1:27:24] come to to be able to worship to bring
[1:27:26] our families to it's not about the
[1:27:28] outward adorning if that's what it is
[1:27:31] brothers and sisters I want to say just
[1:27:32] take a step
[1:27:34] backwards and get right with
[1:27:36] God because it's not about the outward
[1:27:38] adorning it's all about the inward work
[1:27:42] the inner man living out through us now
[1:27:45] remember as we speak about all this
[1:27:47] we're also speaking about Christ in the
[1:27:48] church the wife is the feminine taken
[1:27:51] from the man the masculine
[1:27:54] now sometimes that can be a real
[1:27:56] interesting one when we look at the
[1:27:58] natural typing the spiritual sometimes
[1:28:01] our wives can be a little bit different
[1:28:03] than maybe we
[1:28:05] are God knows exactly what we need and
[1:28:08] you know that's the way it is the wife
[1:28:11] is the feminine taken from the man she
[1:28:14] is that mass that feminine portion taken
[1:28:16] out of the man the masculine and we know
[1:28:20] that the church is the feminine that was
[1:28:23] taken from Christ the masculine and and
[1:28:26] you know when we talk about this in this
[1:28:28] light is it it isn't it interesting you
[1:28:30] can just see it we've said it many times
[1:28:32] in the past but it's no wonder the world
[1:28:35] is all mixed up about the masculine and
[1:28:38] The Feminine and what's your pronoun and
[1:28:41] what is all this
[1:28:43] business I mean what is that that's the
[1:28:45] anointing of understanding where we're
[1:28:47] at today Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:28:50] today forever the husband the Heavenly
[1:28:53] bridegroom who has taken his Earthly
[1:28:56] bride his Earthly bride and him become
[1:29:00] one you know in the Amplified Bible I
[1:29:03] just would like to speak um about this
[1:29:06] scripture I'm going to read this
[1:29:07] scripture out of the Amplified Bible and
[1:29:10] I'm not saying that I know I've talked
[1:29:12] about using different
[1:29:14] Bibles bear with me the Amplified Bible
[1:29:19] in uh 1 Peter chapter
[1:29:21] 3 the same scriptures that we've read
[1:29:23] and like manner you married women be
[1:29:26] submissive to your own
[1:29:28] husbands subordinate
[1:29:31] yourselves as being secondary to and
[1:29:34] dependent on
[1:29:35] them and adapt yourselves to
[1:29:39] them so that even if any do not obey the
[1:29:43] word of
[1:29:45] God they may be one
[1:29:49] over not by the
[1:29:52] discussion not by discussion but by The
[1:29:55] Godly lives of their
[1:29:57] wives I think it's just interesting to
[1:30:00] shine a light on it from a little bit of
[1:30:01] a different
[1:30:02] perspective because many
[1:30:06] times I'm guilty of it before I even say
[1:30:10] it many times we can have something
[1:30:12] happen in our
[1:30:14] marriage and we can be real quick to go
[1:30:16] and talk about our wives or our husbands
[1:30:20] in a certain way to other people
[1:30:24] and not a good way in a negative way and
[1:30:27] when we do that we're actually not
[1:30:30] helping the situation what we're doing
[1:30:31] as we're pouring gasoline on the fire
[1:30:35] and brother bradam says that we're
[1:30:36] actually attacking that person's
[1:30:38] character and I think he even says
[1:30:40] assassinating their character you can
[1:30:42] kill a man without actually killing him
[1:30:45] you can kill his influence just by
[1:30:47] talking bad about him and wives can do
[1:30:50] that about their husbands and husbands
[1:30:52] can do that about their wives Brothers
[1:30:54] can do it about sisters sisters can do
[1:30:57] it about brothers Brothers brothers
[1:30:58] sisters sisters we can destroy one
[1:31:01] another just by talking about one
[1:31:04] another goes on to say when they observe
[1:31:07] the pure and modest way in which Al I'll
[1:31:10] just go back and read this again and
[1:31:11] stop talking in like manner you married
[1:31:14] women be submissive to your own husband
[1:31:16] subordinate yourselves as being
[1:31:17] secondary to and dependent on them and
[1:31:20] adapt yourselves to them so that even if
[1:31:23] any many do not obey the word of God
[1:31:25] they may be one over not by the dis by
[1:31:28] discussion but by Godly lives of their
[1:31:30] wives when they observe the pure and
[1:31:34] modest way in which you conduct
[1:31:36] yourselves together with your reverence
[1:31:39] for your husband you are to feel for him
[1:31:44] all that reverence includes to respect
[1:31:48] defer to rever him to honor esteem
[1:31:53] appreciate apprciate prize and in the
[1:31:56] human sense to adore him that is to
[1:31:59] admire praise be devoted to deeply love
[1:32:04] and enjoy your
[1:32:06] husband now I'm reading all this and I'm
[1:32:09] thinking my I want to blush because I
[1:32:10] don't think that I'm saying this that I
[1:32:12] want my wife to actually try and get a
[1:32:14] message
[1:32:16] here but this is what the word in the
[1:32:19] Amplified Bible is saying about second
[1:32:22] Peter chapter 3 in the King James
[1:32:23] version
[1:32:24] this is how the wives ought to actually
[1:32:27] conduct themselves towards their
[1:32:29] husbands I want to ask the question is
[1:32:31] that what we're doing now I want to take
[1:32:34] it and parallel it and say as the Bride
[1:32:36] of Jesus Christ Brothers brothers
[1:32:39] sisters are we behaving this way about
[1:32:42] our heavenly
[1:32:46] father why goes on to say let not yours
[1:32:50] be merely external adorning with a
[1:32:53] elaborate interweaving and nodding of
[1:32:56] the hair and wearing of jewelry or
[1:32:59] changes of
[1:33:00] clothes don't don't let it be just 10 or
[1:33:04] or half an hour early for service and a
[1:33:07] bunch of quotes that I know and
[1:33:09] everything is good in my life and my car
[1:33:11] is clean and I got money in the bank and
[1:33:13] I believe the message of the hour but
[1:33:15] yet I mistreat my wife or I mistreat my
[1:33:18] husband no don't let it be the outward
[1:33:20] adorning I would say this brothers and
[1:33:22] sisters I'd much rather see you 10
[1:33:24] minutes 20 minutes late for service and
[1:33:26] be serving God with all your might than
[1:33:29] to see people who are washed whitewashed
[1:33:33] now I'm not saying we are I just feel
[1:33:36] led to go this way forgive me I don't
[1:33:39] know sometimes you just have to let the
[1:33:40] Lord lead not yours be the merely
[1:33:44] external adorning with elaborate
[1:33:46] interweaving a noding of the hair and
[1:33:48] wearing of jewelry or changes of clothes
[1:33:51] but let it be the inward adorning and
[1:33:54] Beauty the hidden person of the heart
[1:33:58] who's that person is it me is it you no
[1:34:03] we talked about it it's Jesus
[1:34:05] Christ the hidden person of the heart
[1:34:08] with The Incorruptible and unfading
[1:34:10] charm of a gentle and peaceful Spirit
[1:34:15] which is not anxious or rought up but is
[1:34:18] very precious in the sight of God for it
[1:34:21] was thus that the pious woman of all who
[1:34:24] hoped in God were accustomed to beautify
[1:34:27] themselves and were submissive to their
[1:34:29] husbands adapting themselves to them as
[1:34:33] themselves secondary and depending upon
[1:34:36] them it was thus that Sarah obeyed
[1:34:39] Abraham following his guidance and
[1:34:41] acknowledging his headship over her by
[1:34:45] calling him
[1:34:46] Lord Master leader Authority and you are
[1:34:51] now her true daughters if you do right
[1:34:54] and let nothing terrify you not giving
[1:34:56] way to hysterical fears or letting
[1:35:01] anxieties unnerve
[1:35:04] you this is pretty
[1:35:07] strong and to look at it I think it's
[1:35:09] fascinating also because we know brother
[1:35:12] Branham talks about everybody wants to
[1:35:15] talk about
[1:35:16] Jesus everybody in the Christian World
[1:35:18] wants to claim the blood of Jesus
[1:35:21] everybody wants to talk about the father
[1:35:23] and the Son and the Holy Ghost and say
[1:35:26] the name of Jesus but there's only a few
[1:35:29] people that really want to say Lord
[1:35:32] Jesus because when we say Lord Jesus
[1:35:36] that means he is governing over all of
[1:35:39] the Affairs in our
[1:35:41] lives all of the Affairs and to look at
[1:35:45] this here to see the way it's written is
[1:35:48] that she called him Lord she
[1:35:50] acknowledged his headship by calling him
[1:35:54] Lord Master leader Authority now I'm not
[1:35:58] saying brothers and sisters that by any
[1:36:00] means I would insist or encourage that
[1:36:04] our sisters would call our husbands
[1:36:06] Lords but there is a scriptural value to
[1:36:09] it and I would say defer to the Holy
[1:36:12] Ghost and see what he tells you about it
[1:36:15] I'm not going to say that you should do
[1:36:16] anything I think that's so beautiful
[1:36:18] we're going to talk about this as we go
[1:36:20] we're not a church that preaches dos and
[1:36:22] don'ts except EX for one thing and one
[1:36:25] thing alone and that one thing is to
[1:36:27] come to know Jesus Christ in the power
[1:36:30] of his resurrection through the baptism
[1:36:33] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:35] according to the prophet of Malachi 4
[1:36:38] that's the one do that we will encourage
[1:36:41] we will also say no there's one don't
[1:36:44] and that is to resist getting the holy
[1:36:46] ghost in your life because if you resist
[1:36:49] to get the Holy Ghost in your life then
[1:36:50] you automatically take the mark of the
[1:36:52] beast
[1:36:54] We Don't
[1:36:56] Preach boy if you're not in service half
[1:37:00] an hour before that we're going to send
[1:37:02] the deacons to your house we don't
[1:37:04] preach that you have got to wear a
[1:37:07] certain length of skirt or you can't
[1:37:09] come through those doors We Don't Preach
[1:37:11] that you can only wear a certain height
[1:37:14] of heel however that that measurement
[1:37:18] measures up we We Don't Preach any of
[1:37:20] that we don't actually try we preach We
[1:37:25] Don't Preach dos and don'ts is what I'm
[1:37:27] trying to
[1:37:29] say and that's not going to happen what
[1:37:32] we do want to do is encourage us
[1:37:34] according to the word of God this house
[1:37:36] should be a House of Prayer it should be
[1:37:38] a house of worship it should be the
[1:37:39] safest place that we can ever come to
[1:37:41] Brothers should be able to come to
[1:37:43] church and not have to worry about
[1:37:45] looking at sisters in an ungodly fashion
[1:37:48] and the reason for that brothers and
[1:37:49] sisters is sisters should not be coming
[1:37:52] to church in such a way that a brother
[1:37:54] is going to be enticed to look at her if
[1:37:56] that happens there's something wrong
[1:37:57] with that sister now this isn't just
[1:38:00] brother Barry saying this this is the
[1:38:01] prophet of Malachi 4 that's saying it
[1:38:04] and we're going to get right into it in
[1:38:05] questions and answers number
[1:38:08] three we
[1:38:10] start paragraph 3:30 brother bradam how
[1:38:13] am I supposed to show my wife that I
[1:38:15] really care for her and yet play or stay
[1:38:19] with the word that's stay with the word
[1:38:22] but still having a question like this
[1:38:24] said why don't you practice what you
[1:38:27] preach or believe and I think I brought
[1:38:29] this up a little while ago I thought it
[1:38:30] was just a really good place to start as
[1:38:32] husbands as wives we really need to make
[1:38:34] sure that we are practicing what we're
[1:38:37] preaching well then if the wife if the
[1:38:40] wife is saying this to you when she's
[1:38:43] has the right to say it when she has the
[1:38:47] right to say it you better get right
[1:38:50] see than if she is saying it just just
[1:38:53] to be evil remember the Bible said it's
[1:38:56] better that a millstone was hanged
[1:38:57] around your neck and drown in the depths
[1:38:59] of the sea than even to offend the least
[1:39:01] of these my little
[1:39:03] ones now that's just yours and I'm just
[1:39:06] going to throw this out there I've said
[1:39:07] it before in the past you know the the
[1:39:09] wives are are a part of the husbands the
[1:39:11] husbands are a part of the wives many
[1:39:14] times we would say the wife she's a
[1:39:16] weaker vessel right and you know I want
[1:39:20] to say this that doesn't mean that she's
[1:39:22] not smarter
[1:39:24] sometimes the wives can be a little
[1:39:26] smarter sometimes the wives can perceive
[1:39:28] things in just a little different way
[1:39:30] maybe they're not more intelligent but
[1:39:31] maybe they've got the ability to see
[1:39:33] things and operate things in a way that
[1:39:35] the husband doesn't just like the
[1:39:37] husband has the way to do that in his
[1:39:39] way she's a weaker vessel because she's
[1:39:42] actually not as
[1:39:43] strong and also she was the one that was
[1:39:46] actually tempted we know that a a Adam
[1:39:50] wasn't tempted Adam wasn't deceived
[1:39:53] Eve was deceived she can be a little bit
[1:39:56] weaker in terms of deception that's why
[1:39:59] she has a husband to lead
[1:40:01] her see then if she's saying it just to
[1:40:04] be evil remember the Bible said it was
[1:40:06] better than a millstone hanged around
[1:40:07] her neck and drawn on the depths of the
[1:40:08] sea even to offend even the least of my
[1:40:11] little ones so I I think it's good how
[1:40:13] he says this
[1:40:16] here just going back a little bit well
[1:40:18] then if the wife if the wife is saying
[1:40:20] this to
[1:40:21] you when she's got the right to say it
[1:40:25] you better get right
[1:40:26] see but if she's talking evil then we
[1:40:29] know what he said there going on he says
[1:40:32] and it may be that this wife is not that
[1:40:35] type of person maybe she's different
[1:40:38] maybe she's a good person maybe she's
[1:40:40] just testing you to see what you'll do
[1:40:43] now stay in love with her and let her
[1:40:45] see Jesus in
[1:40:49] you don't just preach Jesus
[1:40:53] talk is cheat let her see Jesus in you
[1:40:57] if you want to see her follow you follow
[1:41:01] Christ let her see Jesus in
[1:41:05] you see you just go on I give a little
[1:41:10] illustration this morning about a person
[1:41:12] one time this little woman had received
[1:41:15] the Holy Ghost she was a very sweet
[1:41:17] little
[1:41:19] person she said well she'd had a hard
[1:41:21] life and her husband was an
[1:41:24] coholic and so she just kept
[1:41:29] on we know that's exactly according to
[1:41:31] our scripture this morning in 1 Peter
[1:41:32] chapter 3 she just kept on she bore with
[1:41:36] him she probably had every right to put
[1:41:39] him away in her mind naturally speaking
[1:41:42] in the world he's an alcoholic maybe
[1:41:44] raging alcoholic maybe just a
[1:41:48] bum it's interesting because I've got a
[1:41:50] sister that I know in uh Africa sister
[1:41:53] Marian's Aunt Auntie she's got a a a
[1:41:58] story she has a testimony my goodness
[1:42:01] anyways I'll I'll just carry on here and
[1:42:03] so she just kept on she bore with him he
[1:42:05] says you want to go to church honey take
[1:42:08] off but now he went down to the saloon
[1:42:10] down at the Old Brown Derby down here
[1:42:13] going on so they hung out down there
[1:42:15] till all the time used to be boners many
[1:42:18] of you old remember when bonifer had the
[1:42:21] corner it's called Derby now I believe
[1:42:23] it is so hanging around down there and
[1:42:25] the first thing you know one night come
[1:42:27] up a question about church and about
[1:42:30] Christians and you know if anybody has
[1:42:32] ever experienced alcohol in your lives
[1:42:35] you'll you'll know that it's interesting
[1:42:38] that Christianity and and the name Jesus
[1:42:41] Christ comes up the discussion comes up
[1:42:44] when the spirits are at play it's
[1:42:46] interesting how that happens and it
[1:42:48] happens one of these old drunks sitting
[1:42:51] there said there ain't no such thing as
[1:42:54] Christians
[1:42:56] anymore now what would cause a man to
[1:42:59] say that you could only imagine a whole
[1:43:02] bunch of impersonation a whole bunch of
[1:43:04] whitewashed people in his life maybe
[1:43:07] just when he was a kid maybe all the way
[1:43:08] through his life but somewhere along the
[1:43:10] way he got to see the Hypocrites that
[1:43:13] we've heard about and I know that I was
[1:43:15] guilty of calling Christians Hypocrites
[1:43:17] but I got corrected the word of God
[1:43:20] corrects all the error one of these old
[1:43:23] drunk sitting there said there ain't no
[1:43:24] such thing as Christians anymore and
[1:43:25] there's no such thing all these bunch of
[1:43:28] Hypocrites said you see them out here
[1:43:30] smoking and drinking doing the same
[1:43:32] thing that we do and said call
[1:43:35] themselves Christians there's no such
[1:43:38] how could you blame
[1:43:39] them people come to church and then they
[1:43:42] go out to the bar afterwards and have a
[1:43:44] drink go and carry on maybe go to
[1:43:48] different venues where there's just all
[1:43:50] manner of Evil My
[1:43:53] we're no different than those people and
[1:43:55] maybe we are inside but if somebody were
[1:43:57] to see us they would say look what
[1:43:59] they're doing look where they're at
[1:44:01] those are
[1:44:03] Christians this one drunk raised up and
[1:44:06] said just a minute there's one that I
[1:44:09] know about said who is it said it's my
[1:44:13] wife
[1:44:14] see can you imagine this guy in his
[1:44:17] drunken stuper now God is forcing him to
[1:44:21] Bear Witness
[1:44:24] he's preaching in his drunkenness it's
[1:44:27] my wife see she's become salty he was
[1:44:30] catching it all the time he said I bet
[1:44:33] if she was put to a
[1:44:35] squeeze he said no she's still a
[1:44:38] Christian I'll prove it to you said I'll
[1:44:42] tell you what Let's do let's go up home
[1:44:44] and I'll show you whether she's a
[1:44:46] Christian or not said let's go up home
[1:44:48] and now let's really be drunk we're
[1:44:51] going to act like we're really drunk
[1:44:53] knocked at the door come and staggering
[1:44:55] over and
[1:44:56] everything and why the chair sitting
[1:44:59] around this way and everything and she
[1:45:01] set them on a chair his guest you know
[1:45:04] and tried to make them just as welcome
[1:45:06] as they could be you know I I I I don't
[1:45:09] think it's this quote but I just can't
[1:45:11] help but think about how there's a story
[1:45:13] that brother brandom talks about how the
[1:45:15] sister said you know doesn't matter what
[1:45:18] you do doesn't matter where you go make
[1:45:20] sure you come home to me cuz you're my
[1:45:23] husband and I love you it makes me
[1:45:25] wonder would we receive this kind of
[1:45:27] reception
[1:45:29] woo no I wouldn't recommend going out
[1:45:32] and
[1:45:33] pretending don't go out and drink and
[1:45:35] come home you don't want this kind of
[1:45:37] outcome he he says I want you to fix us
[1:45:39] some supper and so they she went out and
[1:45:42] fixed some said we we want ham and eggs
[1:45:45] he know they had it so so they fixed the
[1:45:48] ham and eggs and when he got there at
[1:45:50] the table he looked at them like that
[1:45:52] pick P up his plate and slammed the
[1:45:54] stuff on the floor now I I can tell you
[1:45:56] by experience I've witnessed this before
[1:45:58] in the past and what it resulted in was
[1:46:00] a bent frying pan guess how the frying
[1:46:03] pan got
[1:46:04] bent and I'm not joking it's real I bent
[1:46:08] frying pan and when he got there at the
[1:46:10] table he looked at at them like picked
[1:46:12] up his plate and slammed the stuff on
[1:46:14] the floor said you know I don't like my
[1:46:16] eggs like that come on boys let's get
[1:46:19] out of here anyhow like that
[1:46:23] they went out and sat down like that you
[1:46:25] know can you imagine how hurt she must
[1:46:27] have
[1:46:28] been how disgusted she must have been
[1:46:31] Naturally Speaking how upset she must
[1:46:33] have been probably broke a plate made a
[1:46:35] big mess here she knew they were drunk
[1:46:38] she was upset from the very beginning
[1:46:40] but yet him and his Entourage his posi
[1:46:42] come in and he makes this big stupid
[1:46:47] show Naturally Speaking a woman wouldn't
[1:46:50] do what she did
[1:46:53] come on boys let's get out of here like
[1:46:55] that they went out and sat down like
[1:46:57] that you know and she come out she said
[1:46:59] dear I'm sorry I didn't get them fixed
[1:47:04] I'll fix some more for
[1:47:08] you oh nonsense you know I didn't want
[1:47:11] them that way in the first place just
[1:47:12] carrying on like that they went out
[1:47:14] there and sat down and they acted like
[1:47:16] they was drunk they heard her in there
[1:47:18] kind of snubbing to
[1:47:20] herself singing real low
[1:47:24] voice
[1:47:26] my must be that inner
[1:47:28] man she wasn't wearing something
[1:47:32] adorning on the outside was
[1:47:34] she they heard her must Jesus bear the
[1:47:39] cross
[1:47:40] alone all the world go free there's a
[1:47:44] cross for everyone and there's a cross
[1:47:46] for
[1:47:47] me this consecrated cross I'll bear till
[1:47:52] death Shall Set Me
[1:47:54] Free one drunk looked at the other one
[1:47:58] said she's a Christian she's got
[1:48:02] it how could he say that because he was
[1:48:06] able to witness that inner man he knew
[1:48:10] what would happen if he went home and
[1:48:11] tried that with his
[1:48:12] wife he knew what would happen if they
[1:48:15] went home and did it to the other guy's
[1:48:18] wife but there was something different
[1:48:20] about this one wasn't there one drunk
[1:48:23] looked at the other one said she's a
[1:48:24] Christian she's got it and that little
[1:48:26] woman led her husband plus these others
[1:48:28] to Christ that night see why see just be
[1:48:31] real sweet just remember he knows all
[1:48:35] about
[1:48:39] it I just think it's interesting the
[1:48:41] natural definitely types the spiritual
[1:48:43] doesn't
[1:48:44] it know the word says that if any obey
[1:48:46] not the word they also May without the
[1:48:48] word be won by the conversation of the
[1:48:51] wives
[1:48:53] to think that a wife has the opportunity
[1:48:56] to win that Husband by her
[1:48:59] conversation let's turn over to First
[1:49:02] Corinthians still got a little bit of
[1:49:04] time here I hope that
[1:49:09] uh hope that we'll be
[1:49:16] okay 1 Corinthians uh one 1 Corinthians
[1:49:21] 1 11 1
[1:49:25] Corinthians I got myself all mixed
[1:49:38] up I am
[1:49:47] sorry yeah 1 Corinthians chapter 11
[1:49:55] verse
[1:49:57] one be followers of me even as I also am
[1:50:01] of
[1:50:02] Christ now I Praise You Brethren that
[1:50:05] you remember me in all things and keep
[1:50:07] the ordinances as I delivered them to
[1:50:10] you but I would have you to know that
[1:50:13] the head of every man is Christ and the
[1:50:16] head of every woman is the
[1:50:19] man and the head of Christ is God
[1:50:23] every man praying or prophesying having
[1:50:26] his head covered dishonor his
[1:50:30] head and that's why in in this inner
[1:50:35] Veil we don't wear head coverings the
[1:50:37] men take off their hats the men take off
[1:50:41] their hoods because that's what the word
[1:50:43] of God says every man praying or
[1:50:45] prophesying having his head covered
[1:50:48] dishonor his head and we know who his
[1:50:50] head is we just read it verse 5 but
[1:50:52] every woman that prayeth or prophesieth
[1:50:54] with her head uncovered dishonor her
[1:50:58] head for that is even all one as if she
[1:51:04] were
[1:51:05] shaven for if the woman be not covered
[1:51:08] let her also be shorn but if it be a
[1:51:12] shame for a woman to be Shor or shaven
[1:51:15] let her be covered this is where brother
[1:51:18] Bram brings the doctrine of cutting hair
[1:51:21] and this is where we believe it as
[1:51:24] sisters we don't cut our hair there's no
[1:51:26] cutting of hair at all according to the
[1:51:30] word of God some might say well I've got
[1:51:32] split ends brother Barry at all
[1:51:35] according to the word of God and if
[1:51:38] you're going to do it according to the
[1:51:39] word of God shave
[1:51:42] it that's what the word of God says and
[1:51:45] of course we're not going to do that
[1:51:47] because the covering is our hair for the
[1:51:50] Sisters verse seven for a man in indeed
[1:51:52] ought not to cover his head for as much
[1:51:55] as he is the image and glory of God but
[1:51:57] the woman is the glory of the
[1:52:02] man for the man is not of the woman but
[1:52:05] the woman of the man neither was the Man
[1:52:08] created for the woman but the woman for
[1:52:11] the
[1:52:12] man for this cause ought the woman to
[1:52:15] have power on her head because of the
[1:52:19] Angels nevertheless neither is the man
[1:52:22] without the woman neither the woman
[1:52:24] without the man in the
[1:52:28] Lord for as the woman is of the man even
[1:52:32] so is the man also by the woman but all
[1:52:36] things of
[1:52:38] God judge in yourselves is it calmly
[1:52:42] that a woman pray unto God
[1:52:45] uncovered doth not even nature itself
[1:52:48] teach you that if a man have long hair
[1:52:51] it is a shame unto
[1:52:54] him but if a woman have long hair it is
[1:52:57] a glory to
[1:52:59] her for her hair is her
[1:53:03] covering and if any man seem to be
[1:53:05] contentious we have no such custom
[1:53:08] neither the Churches of God I just want
[1:53:11] to say this doesn't matter how long your
[1:53:13] hair is
[1:53:15] sisters don't cut
[1:53:17] it if it's as long as you can grow it
[1:53:20] that's your covering that's what God's
[1:53:22] given you
[1:53:23] keep
[1:53:25] it but don't cut your hair don't trim
[1:53:29] your hair according to the scripture
[1:53:31] that's what we
[1:53:33] believe I think it's just a a wonderful
[1:53:36] thing to take it back to the scripture
[1:53:37] and see how the Lord has this
[1:53:39] orchestrated the woman is of the man
[1:53:42] it's not the other way
[1:53:44] around we we need to the man is not of
[1:53:47] the woman but the woman is of the man
[1:53:49] neither was the Man created for the
[1:53:51] woman but the woman for the
[1:53:54] man and you know because of this there's
[1:53:58] something that is wired inside of a man
[1:54:01] that will cause him to look at a woman
[1:54:04] and if a woman doesn't Adorn herself
[1:54:07] correctly that man will actually look
[1:54:09] upon that woman and that's the way men
[1:54:12] are wired that's the way this nature is
[1:54:16] and that's why I keep going back to this
[1:54:19] house of God this Gathering should be
[1:54:22] the safest Gathering that we can ever
[1:54:24] come to we should never have to fear
[1:54:27] seeing a sister in any other way than a
[1:54:31] sister but I can say it once in a while
[1:54:35] we
[1:54:36] do now it's awfully quiet so I'm going
[1:54:39] to be filling in the gaps here you know
[1:54:42] what brothers and sisters I'll tell you
[1:54:44] honestly as a male a red-blooded male
[1:54:47] there's been times where I've come to
[1:54:48] church and I've thought oh Lord I don't
[1:54:51] want to see that I'm at
[1:54:56] church why am I seeing
[1:54:59] that I can tell you why there's a couple
[1:55:02] different
[1:55:03] reasons but the biggest thing is the
[1:55:06] influence in that sister's life either
[1:55:08] the husband hasn't said anything or the
[1:55:11] wife just doesn't know or the wife is
[1:55:14] under the influence of a wrong Spirit
[1:55:17] now it's not just brother Barry saying
[1:55:18] it this is the message of the hour we're
[1:55:20] going to get into it here we should be
[1:55:22] able to come to church and not have to
[1:55:24] fear looking at a
[1:55:27] sister now I'm going to flip
[1:55:29] it we should not have to fear sisters
[1:55:32] coming to church and looking at a
[1:55:37] brother because I'll say it this way
[1:55:39] sometimes you see clothing on men that
[1:55:42] are way too
[1:55:44] tight anybody going to say Amen to
[1:55:48] that remember all of the fash
[1:55:53] is designed by an
[1:55:57] influence when we're getting styling we
[1:55:59] need to be careful about the style that
[1:56:01] we're putting on Brothers make sure your
[1:56:05] pants are pulled
[1:56:07] up don't wear
[1:56:10] skinnies I mean here we go now brother
[1:56:12] Barry's I can see it brother Barry's
[1:56:14] preaching dos and don'ts do what you
[1:56:15] want to do get the Holy
[1:56:17] Ghost just remember that those skinny
[1:56:19] jeans are created by someone in a
[1:56:22] certain place that are under a certain
[1:56:24] influence see if you can take it back if
[1:56:27] that Designer believes this message of
[1:56:29] the
[1:56:30] hour we can talk about shorts and say
[1:56:33] wearing shorts and you know women out
[1:56:35] wearing shorts the husband sitting on
[1:56:37] the porch got her wife out mowing the
[1:56:40] lawn wearing a bikini or shorts and a
[1:56:42] tight shirt it's a story that brother
[1:56:44] bradam talked about I'm not going to
[1:56:45] read the quote today you can look it up
[1:56:48] we're not talking about that we're
[1:56:49] talking about the Church of the Living
[1:56:50] God coming to the house of the Lord and
[1:56:52] not having to fear we should not have to
[1:56:55] worry about looking at a sister in any
[1:56:57] other way than her being a sister and if
[1:57:00] there's something happening where she is
[1:57:02] showing off certain parts of herself
[1:57:04] there's an influence going
[1:57:07] on and it's not the Holy
[1:57:11] Ghost talking about this first Peter I
[1:57:14] love this scripture First Peter chapter
[1:57:17] 3 I just did a little bit of a a quick
[1:57:20] study on it you know how
[1:57:25] how strongs concordance has some
[1:57:27] meanings for words but let it be the
[1:57:30] hidden concealed
[1:57:34] man the human of the
[1:57:37] heart the heart has the thoughts and the
[1:57:40] feelings which is the heart of that
[1:57:42] which is not corruptible even the
[1:57:46] ornament of a
[1:57:47] Meek mild and
[1:57:50] humble and quiet
[1:57:53] still Peaceable
[1:57:55] Spirit a mental
[1:57:58] disposition which is in the sight of God
[1:58:00] a great
[1:58:02] price sometimes it's not easy to have
[1:58:05] all of that as a brother or a sister I
[1:58:08] know that I know
[1:58:11] that but we talked about a little early
[1:58:14] I said I was jumping ahead when we look
[1:58:16] at this word it is a great price in the
[1:58:20] sight of the Lord
[1:58:23] where is his
[1:58:25] sight if we're if we're dressing
[1:58:27] ourselves in such a
[1:58:29] way that people can look at us and see
[1:58:33] our bodies
[1:58:35] underneath there's something
[1:58:38] wrong and I know Brothers we want we
[1:58:41] want to be able to bench press whatever
[1:58:44] and we want to wear a tight shirt and
[1:58:45] show our pectoral muscles sticking out
[1:58:48] in our shirts and you know I want to say
[1:58:51] is that the Holy Ghost leading us that's
[1:58:53] doing that cuz brother bradam says that
[1:58:56] you can be 200 lb of muscle and still be
[1:58:59] a
[1:59:01] but the real man how is he
[1:59:03] identified according to the prophet in
[1:59:05] our day brothers and sisters how how is
[1:59:07] the real man identified according to the
[1:59:09] prophet he says by the bags and the
[1:59:11] knees of his
[1:59:14] pants his willingness to go on his knees
[1:59:16] and pray for his brothers and sisters
[1:59:18] not the outward adorning it's not just
[1:59:20] sisters it's brother others we need to
[1:59:23] make sure that we're not wearing pants
[1:59:25] slacks dress pants that are too tight
[1:59:29] showing off more than we ought to just
[1:59:31] like sisters ought not to be wearing
[1:59:33] things that are are shirts that are too
[1:59:36] tight I'm just going to be honest I'm a
[1:59:38] red-blooded male and I've been
[1:59:40] embarrassed at times now we know the
[1:59:43] word says that the women should not wear
[1:59:45] garments that pertain to a man and and
[1:59:47] man should not wear garments that
[1:59:48] pertain to a woman but we can still wear
[1:59:51] the proper garments according to those
[1:59:54] classifications but be actually
[1:59:56] presenting ourselves the wrong way
[1:59:59] that's the way the devil is he'll work
[2:00:01] Us in just a little
[2:00:04] tiny fraction an Iota off of where we
[2:00:08] should
[2:00:09] be what I'm getting at is where's the
[2:00:11] sight of
[2:00:14] God where's the sight of God you know
[2:00:16] brothers and sisters I'm not interested
[2:00:18] in preaching dos and don'ts but I am
[2:00:19] very interested in upholding a standard
[2:00:21] a according to the message of the
[2:00:24] hour get the Holy Ghost in your life go
[2:00:26] stand in front of a mirror and say Lord
[2:00:29] is this appropriate for me to come to
[2:00:31] the house of the Living God to worship
[2:00:34] am I going to cause Brothers to look at
[2:00:36] me are they going to see body parts that
[2:00:39] they shouldn't see before they're
[2:00:42] married I had a pastor here I don't know
[2:00:45] who here was around at the time but he
[2:00:48] went off about knit skirts I didn't even
[2:00:51] know what they were I had to ask my wife
[2:00:53] what's a knit skirt I don't even know
[2:00:54] what a knit skirt is what's a knit skirt
[2:00:57] anybody know what a knit skirt is I
[2:00:59] guess there was people wearing net
[2:01:00] skirts that were not appropriate for the
[2:01:02] Church of the Living God what I found
[2:01:04] out is they're very form fitting very
[2:01:06] thin and what they do is they show off
[2:01:09] the body why do we want to show off our
[2:01:13] body because we want to be like the
[2:01:15] world brothers and sisters whatever
[2:01:17] we're feeding on that's what we're going
[2:01:18] to become amen amen let's let's not be
[2:01:22] looking at the world let's be looking at
[2:01:25] Christ where's the sight of God in the
[2:01:28] eyes of your brothers and your
[2:01:30] sisters and I would say potential even
[2:01:33] unbelievers people that don't even know
[2:01:35] the word of God who are maybe drunken
[2:01:37] fools going over to a buddy's house
[2:01:39] who's going to mock his wife because he
[2:01:42] says she's a Christian but that man is
[2:01:44] going to Bear witness and someday he'll
[2:01:46] be able to say you know I saw that
[2:01:48] person dressing
[2:01:49] immorally that's where the sight of God
[2:01:51] is
[2:01:55] is it a time or a
[2:01:57] place it's no time or place job 34:21 he
[2:02:01] says for his eyes are upon the ways of
[2:02:04] man and he seeth all of his goings not
[2:02:08] just some of them where I'm at today
[2:02:11] brothers and sisters is not just with
[2:02:13] sisters I'm not throwing off on sisters
[2:02:16] what I'm doing is trying to uphold a
[2:02:18] standard I want to try and pull up some
[2:02:19] bootstraps and encourage us to take a
[2:02:22] look at our lives let's take a look at
[2:02:25] the way we behave let's take a look at
[2:02:28] who we are as Believers of this message
[2:02:30] of the hour we should have the greatest
[2:02:32] standard there
[2:02:35] is are we wearing high heels
[2:02:38] sisters if we are why are
[2:02:43] we are we wearing tight fitting clothing
[2:02:45] if we are why why are
[2:02:48] we maybe some sisters would say well
[2:02:51] I've I've gained weight brother Barry
[2:02:52] I've had children and I I I say Amen you
[2:02:55] know I understand that that's what
[2:02:56] happens that's the way this life
[2:02:59] is but get some different
[2:03:01] clothes there's different Avenues
[2:03:03] there's different opportunities and I
[2:03:04] would say this if anybody has any any
[2:03:06] opposition to what I'm saying pertaining
[2:03:08] to that specifically come see me if you
[2:03:11] need financial aid for that then we'll
[2:03:13] help
[2:03:14] you it's
[2:03:16] important brothers and sisters if man is
[2:03:20] looking at a woman that woman is going
[2:03:22] to be held responsible amen that's what
[2:03:25] God Said through the prophet to this age
[2:03:27] that's why I'm talking about it here
[2:03:30] this is not a
[2:03:31] joke 1965 does God ever change his mind
[2:03:35] he says so many are doing today the same
[2:03:38] thing we know that's right they sell out
[2:03:40] their Birthright ha women professing the
[2:03:43] Holy Ghost wearing shorts man permitting
[2:03:47] them in the pulpits Bob haired women in
[2:03:49] the pulpits paint on their face
[2:03:52] with religious gowns
[2:03:54] on the biggest stumbling block the
[2:03:56] church has ever had if you want to know
[2:03:59] in political Powers what time it is in
[2:04:02] the Kingdom age see where the Jews are
[2:04:04] you see where the Jews are oh my today
[2:04:08] they were blowing the trumpets for the
[2:04:10] Feast of Tabernacles the Levites are
[2:04:13] practicing the Feast of Tabernacles if
[2:04:16] you want to know in political Powers
[2:04:17] what time it is in the Kingdom age see
[2:04:19] where the Jews are watch how the Jews
[2:04:21] are because they are a nation if you
[2:04:23] want to know where the nations are
[2:04:25] standing watch the Jews the Jews are
[2:04:28] wound up like a spring and they're just
[2:04:30] about to go off brothers and sisters if
[2:04:33] you're watching the Jews my goodness if
[2:04:35] you want to know where the church is
[2:04:36] standing watch the women watch the
[2:04:39] morals among the women cuz she's a
[2:04:42] representation of the church when you
[2:04:44] see the pollution amongst the women you
[2:04:47] find the pollution in the church what
[2:04:50] she become a painted up Jezebel just
[2:04:52] exactly what the church has become see
[2:04:55] now that's the truth and you know that
[2:04:57] see if you want to know where the church
[2:05:00] is watch your morals among your women
[2:05:02] cuz she is the church is a woman if you
[2:05:06] want to know the national status watch
[2:05:08] the Jews brothers and sisters this is a
[2:05:12] an encouragement to take a look at our
[2:05:15] lives we have got to hold the standard
[2:05:18] strong in this building in this
[2:05:20] Gathering if we want to see God move in
[2:05:23] our lives there is no room for
[2:05:33] variance if you want to see where the
[2:05:35] church is watch the
[2:05:37] woman I want to say it this way if we
[2:05:39] want to see where the Church of the
[2:05:40] Living God is take a look at the
[2:05:43] female take a look at all of them look
[2:05:45] at the husbands don't just throw it off
[2:05:47] on the wives and say look at them look
[2:05:49] at them they're wearing clothes too
[2:05:50] tight heels too high they don't listen
[2:05:53] to me they're not of a a Meek and a
[2:05:55] quiet
[2:05:56] Spirit when we do that are we actually
[2:05:59] practicing what we preach what we read a
[2:06:01] little bit earlier or are we changing
[2:06:03] the situation with our conversation by
[2:06:05] saying she is my bride I love her with
[2:06:09] all my heart look at that sister over
[2:06:11] there maybe she just doesn't have a
[2:06:12] revelation yet you know what I'm going
[2:06:13] to do I'm G to go and I'm gonna work on
[2:06:16] being masculine I don't need pectorals I
[2:06:18] need bags in my pants like the prophet
[2:06:21] of God said and I'm going to put them
[2:06:23] there for my
[2:06:24] sister I'm not going to throw off on her
[2:06:27] and likewise sisters when you see a
[2:06:30] brother we need to make sure that we're
[2:06:32] looking after one another that's why we
[2:06:34] have a a church that's why we gather
[2:06:37] together that's why we're part of a
[2:06:39] body we have much more than an outward
[2:06:43] appearance we have that inward man of
[2:06:47] Christ and if you don't if you don't
[2:06:50] know if you have that in man of Christ I
[2:06:53] want to encourage you right now at the
[2:06:55] sound of my voice to consider looking
[2:06:58] into getting that inner man of Christ
[2:07:01] for
[2:07:02] yourself because that's the only way
[2:07:05] that we're going to make it out of
[2:07:06] here we can look into it adorning
[2:07:09] ourselves with a Peaceable fruit of
[2:07:11] righteousness not outward appearance of
[2:07:15] clothing vehicles
[2:07:17] houses maybe social I've got a great
[2:07:20] social standing in the Community I got a
[2:07:22] great social media I've even got my own
[2:07:25] website on and on I'm saying this
[2:07:27] because I went down that
[2:07:29] road we're not adorning ourselves with
[2:07:32] all of that we want the Peaceable fruit
[2:07:33] of righteousness we want the people
[2:07:35] around us to say what is it about you
[2:07:37] man in Romans chapter 8:22 it says for
[2:07:40] we know that the whole creation granth
[2:07:42] and travaileth in pain together until
[2:07:45] now and not only they but ourselves also
[2:07:48] which have the first fruits of the
[2:07:50] spirit hidden
[2:07:53] man we even we ourselves grown within
[2:07:56] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[2:07:58] ITT the Redemption of our
[2:08:01] body Galatians 5:22 but the fruit of the
[2:08:05] spirit the fruit of that inner man that
[2:08:09] fruit that we've talked about that grows
[2:08:11] on the branches that other people can
[2:08:15] pick and enjoy the fruit of the spirit
[2:08:18] is love joy peace long suffering
[2:08:20] gentleness goodness Faith meekness
[2:08:22] Temperance against such there is no law
[2:08:24] Ephesians 5:9 for the fruit of the
[2:08:27] spirit is in all goodness and
[2:08:29] righteousness and
[2:08:30] Truth there ain't no room for
[2:08:33] lies all liars will find themselves in
[2:08:36] the Lake of
[2:08:37] Fire but get the spirit of Jesus Christ
[2:08:40] in your life and he'll burn out all of
[2:08:44] that Ephesians chapter 5:32 this is a
[2:08:47] great mystery but I speak concerning
[2:08:49] Christ and the church I think it's so
[2:08:52] beautiful we can bring it right back to
[2:08:55] every single one of our Lives it's a
[2:08:57] great mystery but I speak concerning
[2:08:59] Christ and the church the masculine and
[2:09:02] The Feminine we're not we're not worried
[2:09:05] about dos and
[2:09:07] don'ts I'm just looking to bring this to
[2:09:09] the top of our
[2:09:11] minds this is a place where we should be
[2:09:13] safe we should be safe to worship freely
[2:09:16] we should be safe to look anywhere and
[2:09:20] not have to worry not have to do what
[2:09:23] I've heard some Christian authors say as
[2:09:25] a male what you need to do when you see
[2:09:27] something we know brother bradam talks
[2:09:28] about it we could talk about this for a
[2:09:30] little bit brother Bram said he put a
[2:09:32] cross hanging from the mirror in his car
[2:09:34] for a purpose that when he saw that
[2:09:36] immoral woman walking across this is a
[2:09:38] prophet of God saying this he saw the
[2:09:40] immoral woman walking across the street
[2:09:42] he would maybe see it but then his eyes
[2:09:44] would catch that cross and he would
[2:09:46] remember the cross of Jesus Christ how
[2:09:49] he had his Redemption per purchased for
[2:09:51] him and how that person out there
[2:09:53] doesn't know him in the way that he
[2:09:56] knows him what a wonderful thing it is
[2:09:58] but you know we don't we don't have to
[2:10:00] worry about being distracted or
[2:10:02] influenced by what we see in others
[2:10:05] doing there shouldn't be a desire
[2:10:07] brothers and sisters to show our bodies
[2:10:09] off that is worldly I'm going to preach
[2:10:12] that straight that is worldly if we're
[2:10:14] looking to show our bodies off that's
[2:10:16] worldly hey if you've got a beautiful
[2:10:18] suit or you got a beautiful dress that's
[2:10:21] that's wonderful and you should show
[2:10:23] that off not your
[2:10:27] body
[2:10:29] right is this right or
[2:10:35] wrong nor should there be desire to have
[2:10:38] others notice us this is the house of
[2:10:41] the Lord and we want to create an
[2:10:42] environment where we can be
[2:10:45] safe I've said it and said it and said
[2:10:47] it it's not dos and don'ts get the Holy
[2:10:49] Ghost let Jesus Christ come into your
[2:10:52] heart and see see if you can rationalize
[2:10:56] your behavior with what he's doing what
[2:10:59] he wants done because we know full well
[2:11:02] there's things in this world that aren't
[2:11:04] spoken about in the Bible and they're
[2:11:06] not spoken about in the message of the
[2:11:08] hour that's why it's a treacherous time
[2:11:11] there's so many choices so many options
[2:11:13] so many things that we can do on our
[2:11:16] own but is he Lord because if he's Lord
[2:11:19] then we're going to say be Lord
[2:11:22] and help me make this decision whatever
[2:11:25] it is big or
[2:11:27] small but you know we don't preach dues
[2:11:29] ands we preach Christ
[2:11:31] crucified so we can have his Spirit the
[2:11:33] Holy Ghost to lead us and guide
[2:11:35] us I was at a meeting I think I talked
[2:11:37] about this are we okay for a couple more
[2:11:39] minutes kind of just in a bit of a
[2:11:42] different service today I hope it's
[2:11:44] okay I might have to go find a juniper
[2:11:46] tree when we're
[2:11:48] done I was at a a meeting with my wife
[2:11:51] and it was about school dress and our
[2:11:55] boys attend a Christian School and it
[2:11:57] was interesting because the the dress
[2:12:00] code was what was under scrutiny and
[2:12:02] there's people that want to be able to
[2:12:04] dress worldly however they want and
[2:12:07] they're trying to impose that upon the
[2:12:09] values that the Christian School has
[2:12:11] they don't have uniforms and there was
[2:12:13] one family that had I don't know four
[2:12:15] girls I think and they all had torn up
[2:12:17] jeans I mean really torn up jeans and
[2:12:20] really tight tops and you know worldly
[2:12:23] stuff and uh they were saying the school
[2:12:26] was saying we're not interested in any
[2:12:28] tears in our clothes none and if that's
[2:12:31] what you want to bring then we're going
[2:12:33] to have to send you home because that's
[2:12:35] the rule no tears in the clothing well
[2:12:38] we we've spent so much money on these
[2:12:39] clothes how are we ever going to be able
[2:12:41] to do this and The woman there that was
[2:12:42] moderating she said hey you know what
[2:12:44] let's let's book a time and I'll
[2:12:46] actually teach you how to mend I've got
[2:12:48] a sewing machine we'll get some goods
[2:12:50] and we'll sew these jeans together I'll
[2:12:53] teach you how to do it for free we'll
[2:12:54] get together and we'll do a little
[2:12:56] workshop and I I was amazed I thought my
[2:12:59] goodness has she ever heard of the
[2:13:00] Prophet where people would say we don't
[2:13:02] have clothing we can't get clothing
[2:13:04] that's going to fit nicely and what he
[2:13:06] said was there's still sewing machines
[2:13:07] and there's still Goods my we're not
[2:13:10] going to be without
[2:13:11] excuse but to hear these people get kind
[2:13:15] of bantering back and forth I was
[2:13:16] intrigued by it it really captivated me
[2:13:19] because I knew they were in an uphill
[2:13:20] battle the world is creeping in and
[2:13:22] there's nothing they can do about it
[2:13:25] really and it was interesting to see it
[2:13:28] and then it wasn't very long before a
[2:13:29] woman stood up high heels skirt cut hair
[2:13:34] etc etc she had the opinion and her
[2:13:37] opinion was that it's not the girl's
[2:13:40] fault it's all the boy's fault the only
[2:13:43] reason we're having these problems is
[2:13:45] the parents aren't training their boys
[2:13:47] to not look at
[2:13:48] girls and you know what I say there's
[2:13:51] Merit to that because as parents we need
[2:13:54] to be training our boys when they become
[2:13:57] to that age we are up in Edmonton at a
[2:13:59] breakfast and there is some really good
[2:14:00] content there I shared it on the men's
[2:14:02] chat if anybody has listened to it if
[2:14:04] you haven't I highly recommend it it's
[2:14:06] up to us brothers and sisters to make
[2:14:08] sure that we're teaching our children
[2:14:09] these things at home if we don't teach
[2:14:12] our children the world is going to and
[2:14:15] we don't want a worldly teaching for the
[2:14:17] message believing
[2:14:19] children but remember hearing it and I
[2:14:22] just thought my isn't it fitting it's
[2:14:23] all the boys's fault that they're
[2:14:25] looking at these girls they should be
[2:14:26] taught it's the parents' problem par
[2:14:28] parental delinquency was basically the
[2:14:30] road she was going down I thought my
[2:14:32] goodness I I have to say I agreed to
[2:14:35] some extent however I don't think she
[2:14:37] ever heard that God sent a prophet I
[2:14:39] don't think she ever heard some of the
[2:14:41] things that that man said you know what
[2:14:45] message is this here out of leadership
[2:14:49] out of leadership in 1965
[2:14:51] brother bradam said Jesus said whosoever
[2:14:54] lookth upon a woman to lust after herath
[2:14:56] committed adultery with her in his
[2:14:59] heart and that's true and that's what
[2:15:01] that woman was saying whoever looks on
[2:15:03] the woman according to the scripture she
[2:15:05] is right
[2:15:06] legalistically 100% correct yeah
[2:15:09] whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust
[2:15:11] after her hath committed adultery with
[2:15:13] her in his heart I say Lord help us then
[2:15:16] he's got to answer for that and he
[2:15:19] will and what' she do according to the
[2:15:23] world she did nothing except for
[2:15:26] purchase worn out clothing like what
[2:15:30] purchase worn out clothing and give it
[2:15:31] to their
[2:15:32] children and he's got answer for that
[2:15:35] and what' she do she presented
[2:15:38] herself who's
[2:15:40] guilty think of
[2:15:43] it you say they don't make any other
[2:15:46] clothes they got goods and sewing
[2:15:49] machines no excuse
[2:15:51] that's
[2:15:53] exactly now I just think it's important
[2:15:56] to make sure that we bring this part
[2:15:57] here brother brandham says now I don't
[2:15:59] want to hurt you and I say today
[2:16:02] brothers and sisters I don't want to
[2:16:03] hurt you I
[2:16:05] don't I just want to encourage us I
[2:16:08] don't want to hurt you either brother
[2:16:11] bradam here he says and this is not a
[2:16:15] joke this is thus saith the
[2:16:18] Lord from the scriptures
[2:16:21] it's exactly true friend he says I'm an
[2:16:24] old man I haven't got much longer to
[2:16:26] stay makes me wonder if he could look
[2:16:29] into the future if he could see into
[2:16:32] time just past 1977 and see some of the
[2:16:35] stuff that's going on
[2:16:37] today I'm an old man I haven't got much
[2:16:39] longer to stay but I've got to tell you
[2:16:42] the truth this is my last message if
[2:16:45] this is my last message it's the truth
[2:16:48] see don't don't sister don't brother and
[2:16:51] I think it's interesting because this
[2:16:52] was leadership then there was communion
[2:16:55] this was his second last message this
[2:16:57] was his last message really communion
[2:16:59] was afterwards that's what he said and
[2:17:02] and you know brothers and sisters that's
[2:17:03] where I stand I have to make sure that
[2:17:05] I'm going to line up with him I'm not
[2:17:07] going to deviate not one iota even if it
[2:17:10] takes my hide off even if I have to have
[2:17:12] arguments or whatever it's going to be
[2:17:14] brothers and sisters we should be able
[2:17:15] to come to the Church of the Living God
[2:17:17] and not have to worry this should be the
[2:17:19] safest place and you know I I just want
[2:17:22] to say we can actually encourage one
[2:17:24] another to be
[2:17:26] safe we can say I don't want to present
[2:17:30] myself in such a way that I could offend
[2:17:32] maybe a young boy if I'm a sister maybe
[2:17:36] if I'm a young man I'm not going to
[2:17:38] dress in such a way that I'm going to
[2:17:39] get a sister looking at me I'm going to
[2:17:41] protect those
[2:17:43] sisters I'm going to protect those
[2:17:45] Brothers we have that responsibility we
[2:17:48] have that capability but brothers and
[2:17:51] sisters who's
[2:17:52] guilty who's guilty I want to say look
[2:17:55] this up it comes up eight hits exactly
[2:17:58] the same point who is guilty and you
[2:18:01] know what brother brandham says brother
[2:18:03] brandham says that when a woman presents
[2:18:05] herself in such a way that it causes a
[2:18:07] man to look at her that she has an evil
[2:18:11] prostitute
[2:18:14] spirit it's no
[2:18:19] joke that's brother Bram and knoweth it
[2:18:21] not
[2:18:23] 1965 what would have happened to your
[2:18:25] grandmother if she had walked out on the
[2:18:27] street with them shorts on they would
[2:18:29] have put her in the insane
[2:18:31] institution she'd come out without a
[2:18:34] dress on there's something wrong with
[2:18:36] her mind if it was so then it is so
[2:18:41] now so it throws the whole world into
[2:18:44] Insanity the whole thing is insane and
[2:18:46] it's so gradually crept in till people
[2:18:49] don't know it and then is where brother
[2:18:51] Barry says I am not going to allow it to
[2:18:54] so gradually creep into the Church of
[2:18:56] the Living God that we preach
[2:18:59] at we have got to uphold the standard
[2:19:02] brothers and sisters the highest
[2:19:05] standard and if we have issue with it
[2:19:07] take it up with God I'm happy to
[2:19:11] converse with you if you want to about
[2:19:13] it goes on to say now she is a
[2:19:17] prostitute not by her husband bowed to
[2:19:21] her body but before
[2:19:25] God and I want to say it this way this
[2:19:28] is just brother Barry spin on it just
[2:19:30] just bear with
[2:19:32] me but he's talking about the she but
[2:19:35] what about the he that will present
[2:19:37] himself in such a way to cause a sister
[2:19:39] to look because it happens you know
[2:19:42] brothers and sisters some of the stats
[2:19:44] are astounding maybe somewhere down the
[2:19:45] road Lord willing will actually talk
[2:19:47] about it maybe just in men's group maybe
[2:19:49] from the pulpit we'll see but if you
[2:19:51] look at the statistics for men versus
[2:19:53] women and what they're looking at on the
[2:19:55] Internet it's probably
[2:19:58] astounding the women the women look is
[2:20:01] what I'm
[2:20:02] saying now is she a prostitute not by
[2:20:06] her husband vow to her body but before
[2:20:09] God she has got an evil prostitute
[2:20:12] Spirit on her do we have this is it
[2:20:15] broken
[2:20:23] and knoweth it not
[2:20:27] 1965 is it
[2:20:35] working paragraph 78 says now she she is
[2:20:39] a prostitute not by her husband vow to
[2:20:42] her body but before God she has an evil
[2:20:45] prostitute Spirit on her that makes her
[2:20:47] dress like that and she's in the leodan
[2:20:49] church age and and don't know that she's
[2:20:52] doing
[2:20:54] that the innocent woman don't know that
[2:20:57] God will judge her for a
[2:21:01] prostitute this is no joke brothers and
[2:21:04] sisters we look around the world we can
[2:21:07] talk about the world we want to see
[2:21:10] Souls saved from the world but I want to
[2:21:13] guard the
[2:21:15] flock I want to make sure we don't have
[2:21:17] any viruses creeping into to the church
[2:21:21] he says there you
[2:21:22] are you get it to her you can't tell her
[2:21:27] there's no way of getting it to her the
[2:21:29] Bible said they're naked and they don't
[2:21:30] know it if you would call her a
[2:21:33] prostitute personally she would have you
[2:21:35] arrested or slapped I'm throwing that in
[2:21:38] there she would I never talk personally
[2:21:41] about
[2:21:43] anybody me either I talk about
[2:21:47] Sin unbelief I don't say this certain
[2:21:50] Church Mr so and so there Reverend so
[2:21:53] and so no no I say that the doctrine of
[2:21:56] that see the whole thing together I
[2:21:58] don't call individual it's not the
[2:21:59] individuals it's the system therein it's
[2:22:02] the world's system and typically I would
[2:22:05] say it's what we're feeding
[2:22:08] on Look Away to Jesus brothers and
[2:22:11] sisters put away the trash get rid of
[2:22:15] the movies get rid of the social get rid
[2:22:18] of all of the worldly influence and and

[2:22:36] bradam in paragraph 283 he says question
[2:22:39] should a Christian woman wear simple
[2:22:41] jewelry as necklaces and Pearls talking
[2:22:44] about dos and don'ts we're not preaching

[2:22:48] brandham he says well sister I know
[2:22:50] means a lot to you and it means a lot to
[2:22:52] for me for you to place your confidence
[2:22:54] I i' tell you the truth now remember the
[2:22:57] Bible said when you Adorn do not adorn
[2:22:59] with costly jewels and pearls and all
[2:23:01] kinds of wearing of jewelry but let that
[2:23:04] be the adorning of a piece and quiet and
[2:23:08] meek Spirit which I just quoted which of
[2:23:12] great is of great price before the Lord
[2:23:15] I love how brother brandham says this
[2:23:17] here because I know of people in the
[2:23:19] message that have actually gotten into a
[2:23:22] big deal over this very topic which is
[2:23:24] so ridiculous if you just read what the
[2:23:26] prophet said here he goes on to say now
[2:23:28] I don't mean by that sister that if you
[2:23:30] had a pin now this is me not the Lord if
[2:23:34] you had a pin that you wanted to wear or
[2:23:36] a little necklace your husband give you
[2:23:39] or maybe your something like that you
[2:23:41] wore now to me I don't think that's bad
[2:23:47] period I don't think that's bad I think
[2:23:50] that's so good to hear now that's just
[2:23:53] me now remember I make myself clear
[2:23:56] that's my opinion and I know there's
[2:23:57] people that will say well I've got a
[2:23:59] stronger opinion about that I've got a
[2:24:01] greater Revelation you got a greater
[2:24:02] revelation of the Prophet greater
[2:24:04] Revelation higher more Pious Revelation
[2:24:07] than the seventh angel
[2:24:09] messenger but I think it's the approach
[2:24:12] to it just like anything what's our
[2:24:16] attitude but I think it's the approach
[2:24:18] to it it's the way you do it see it's
[2:24:21] the motive behind
[2:24:23] it and when you see it's getting a hold
[2:24:26] of you then leave the thing
[2:24:29] Alone brother bradam says if you got a
[2:24:32] question about anything don't do it amen
[2:24:34] and if you struggle with something what
[2:24:35] does he say he says do the
[2:24:38] Opposites hey I want to say it if high
[2:24:40] heels are appealing to you wear low
[2:24:44] heels if wearing tight clothing is
[2:24:46] appealing to you wear loose
[2:24:48] clothing if wearing bright clothing is
[2:24:51] appealing to you well try wearing muted
[2:24:53] clothing in color just do the
[2:24:56] Opposites and when you see it's getting
[2:24:58] a hold of you then leave the thing
[2:25:00] alone but I think you wore but I think
[2:25:03] if you wore your wedding ring it's
[2:25:06] interesting if you wore your wedding
[2:25:08] ring now I know Nazarene people it used
[2:25:10] to be that you wouldn't even baptize a
[2:25:12] woman with a wedding ring on see I don't
[2:25:15] believe that is necessary take it
[2:25:17] completely overboard right in the the
[2:25:20] Bible they wore wedding rings only it
[2:25:22] was a tablet they called it around their
[2:25:24] head nine pieces of a coin in it and we
[2:25:26] know that the word talks about the woman
[2:25:27] who dropped the coin and was looking by
[2:25:29] for it with a candle light before her
[2:25:31] husband came home because if he came
[2:25:32] home and found her without a coin
[2:25:34] missing the coin meant that she was a
[2:25:36] prostitute that's a whole story we won't
[2:25:38] go too far any further with that if a
[2:25:40] woman want to dress and make themselves
[2:25:42] look decent clean ladylike why I think
[2:25:45] there's not a thing to that to me but
[2:25:49] when you get to go to put that thing
[2:25:52] into making it a little pride then
[2:25:55] you're wrong it's your attitude and you
[2:25:58] know I I would say it this way if
[2:25:59] there's anything that the word from the
[2:26:01] prophet said today or anything that is
[2:26:04] said here that that causes an upset I
[2:26:07] want to say why does it cause an
[2:26:11] upset brothers and
[2:26:13] sisters it's so subtle brother Bram said
[2:26:17] it I said it it's no
[2:26:19] joke we're going to stand at the
[2:26:21] Judgment bar one day and account for our
[2:26:24] actions I would not want to stand before
[2:26:27] God and and find out that there was man
[2:26:31] or woman looking upon me in the age in
[2:26:34] which I lived upon and I kind of had
[2:26:37] some sort of a prideful idea in My Mind
[2:26:39] by the clothes that I wore or or or how
[2:26:42] I wore them that it would cause people
[2:26:45] to actually
[2:26:47] sin could you imagine being that person
[2:26:50] we will actually be judged for our
[2:26:52] actions
[2:26:54] there but remember it's that subtle out
[2:26:57] of all the beasts in the world all the
[2:26:59] beasts of the field which one was the
[2:27:01] most subtle that serpent the
[2:27:04] devil that one and you know brothers and
[2:27:07] sisters I just want to say this as
[2:27:09] encouragement maybe we'll call the
[2:27:10] musicians because I'm I'm serious we're
[2:27:12] going to end by
[2:27:13] 12:30 but you
[2:27:16] know brother bradam says that the woman
[2:27:18] that would present herself that way is
[2:27:19] POS
[2:27:20] possessed by an evil prostitute
[2:27:23] Spirit maybe she's not possessed by an
[2:27:26] evil prostitute Spirit maybe she's
[2:27:27] afflicted by an evil prostitute Spirit
[2:27:30] maybe the brother that wants to present
[2:27:32] himself really tight clothing always
[2:27:36] trying to show off how physical they
[2:27:40] are maybe there's something inside of
[2:27:42] him that's afflicting him too maybe
[2:27:44] they're not possessed by it but the
[2:27:46] devil knows there's a little weak spot
[2:27:47] there and so the devil's going to come
[2:27:49] around and work that weak spot anybody
[2:27:50] here have a weak spot anybody know what
[2:27:52] it's like to have a weak spot worked by
[2:27:54] the devil that's all it is I'm not
[2:27:57] saying that we're possessed by the devil
[2:27:59] and we need to have an exorcism I'm
[2:28:01] saying that we're all humans we're all
[2:28:03] Sinners saved by grace and that we do
[2:28:05] get afflicted by the devil and he's
[2:28:07] going to do it until the day that we
[2:28:09] leave this world whether it's by the
[2:28:11] grave or by the sky it's the way it
[2:28:14] works I want to say this these people
[2:28:17] are possibly affected and and you know
[2:28:21] it's our
[2:28:22] duty I would say the people who are
[2:28:24] preaching the people who believe it's
[2:28:26] our duty it's our responsibility to make
[2:28:28] sure sure that we're training up
[2:28:30] children in the way they should go so
[2:28:32] they know we're going to be accountable
[2:28:33] for our children husbands we're going to
[2:28:35] be accountable for our wives preachers
[2:28:38] we're going to be accountable for all
[2:28:40] the people that we preach to are we
[2:28:42] preaching this word the way the prophet
[2:28:44] brought
[2:28:45] it this is a standard that's the highest
[2:28:49] standard out of all the ages we've got
[2:28:51] all of the standard together as one the
[2:28:54] only way that we're going to be able to
[2:28:55] do it brothers and sisters is to apply
[2:28:57] the token the only way you're going to
[2:28:58] be able to apply the token is to get it
[2:29:00] you've got to get the token if we don't
[2:29:02] get the token you can never apply the
[2:29:04] token the prophet said take that token
[2:29:06] and hold it over your prayers if you've
[2:29:08] got something where the devil's
[2:29:09] afflicting you with hold that token over
[2:29:11] your prayers and the devil has to
[2:29:13] move cuz you've already paid your fair
[2:29:16] no he's already paid your fair and
[2:29:19] you've got that to to prove that he's
[2:29:21] already paid it and the devil can't stay
[2:29:24] he has to move maybe stand with me as we
[2:29:27] close
[2:29:28] today let's just
[2:29:31] bow gracious Heavenly Father
[2:29:33] Lord we just love you and we thank you
[2:29:36] for your goodness thank you for your
[2:29:38] Tender Mercies Lord thank you for your
[2:29:40] word thank you for the standard that you

[2:29:45] to know that we won't be without excuse
[2:29:48] father

[2:29:52] account for our lives and our behaviors

[2:30:08] that Grace that we heard walked in and
[2:30:10] pleaded our case at the beginning of the
[2:30:12] service Lord I pray that we could
[2:30:14] remember that Grace Lord as we go
[2:30:16] forwards in our lives Lord and that we
[2:30:18] wouldn't lord judge ourselves harshly if
[2:30:20] we have a situation in our life but that
[2:30:22] we would just turn from our ways that we
[2:30:26] would just make an adjustment in our
[2:30:27] lives Lord and line up with your word
[2:30:29] father Lord let that be our desire even
[2:30:32] if we stumble and fall oh Father what's
[2:30:35] our desire let our desire be unto you
[2:30:38] that you are the Lord Of Our Lives
[2:30:40] father that there's nothing that we want

[2:30:50] and we thank you we just want to commit
[2:30:51] each life into your hands Lord as we go

[2:31:16] and he told them all get under something
[2:31:18] right quick father help us to get right
[2:31:20] under your token right now while we have
