[11:22] [Music]
[12:21] Amen. Greet you all in the matchless
[12:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We're
[12:25] gathered in his name this morning. We're
[12:27] here to raise our voices in praise and
[12:29] adoration to him. Let's stand as we
[12:31] start our service this morning. Blessed
[12:33] be the name of the Lord. He's worthy to
[12:36] be praised. I was thinking of
[12:38] &gt;&gt; Elizabeth being greeted by Mary as she
[12:41] came up when she was pregnant with
[12:42] Jesus. That baby was born, still born as
[12:45] far as I know. And uh Elizabeth and John
[12:48] the Baptist leapt at the name of Jesus.
[12:50] Think about that this morning as we lift
[12:52] up this beautiful, wonderful, matchless
[12:55] name of the Lord Jesus this morning.
[12:58] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[13:05] Oh, he is worthy to be praised and
[13:10] adore.
[13:13] Oh, so we lift up holy hands in one
[13:18] accord,
[13:21] singing, blessed be thy name.
[13:26] Oh, blessed be that name.
[13:31] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh,
[13:36] blessed be the name of the Lord.
[13:43] Oh, he is worthy to be praised and
[13:48] adored.
[13:51] Oh soul we lift up holy hands in one
[13:56] accord.
[13:59] Oh singing blessed be the name.
[14:04] Oh blessed be thy name.
[14:08] Oh blessed be the name of the Lord. So
[14:14] we lift up holy hands in one accord.
[14:21] Oh, singing. Blessed be thy name.
[14:26] Oh, blessed be thy name.
[14:30] Oh, blessed be the name
[14:34] of the Lord.
[14:39] What a beautiful name it is.
[14:43] What a beautiful name it is.
[14:47] and the name of Jesus
[14:51] Christ my king.
[14:55] What a beautiful name it is.
[14:59] Nothing compares to this.
[15:02] What a beautiful name it is. The name of
[15:08] Jesus. Death cannot hold. Death could
[15:12] not hold you.
[15:15] vtory before you
[15:18] s
[15:23] [Applause]
[15:25] [Music]
[15:30] raise your glory
[15:34] for you
[15:36] to
[15:42] have the Heat.
[15:45] Heat.
[15:48] [Music]
[15:55] Heat. Heat.
[15:56] [Music]
[16:07] Oh,
[16:11] what a power.
[16:14] [Music]
[16:27] What a power.
[16:31] Oh,
[16:34] what a power.
[16:39] Oh Jesus. What a powerful
[16:46] Jesus.
[16:50] What a powerful name is.
[16:54] What a power
[16:58] and king of Jesus
[17:01] Christ my
[17:08] [Music]
[17:19] Jesus one more
[17:21] What a powerful name is.
[17:25] Oh, what a powerful name is
[17:29] that
[17:30] Jesus
[17:32] Christ my king.
[17:36] What a powerful name it is.
[17:40] Oh, nothing can say.
[17:44] What a powerful name is that name of
[17:50] Jesus.
[17:54] You may pray with me if you will this
[17:56] morning.
[17:57] [Music]
[17:59] Lord Jesus, as we come before you this
[18:01] morning, Lord, I trust in our hearts.
[18:04] Lord, there's one desire that we have
[18:06] and that's to lift up your name, Lord.
[18:08] Father, may we not not that we don't
[18:11] love each other, but Lord, may we not
[18:14] may we not be swayed by someone sitting
[18:16] beside us whether I should worship you
[18:19] the way you deserve to be.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; But Lord, may it be a personal thing,
[18:23] you sitting beside us. Lord, if the Lord
[18:25] Jesus was sitting beside me, standing
[18:27] beside me this morning, how would I
[18:29] worship him? And Lord, that's the
[18:31] physical form. The fact is that same
[18:34] pillar of fire that appeared above our
[18:36] prophet that appeared above Moses with
[18:38] Moses in the burning bush. Lord, that
[18:40] same prophet that that that or that same
[18:43] pillar of fire that appeared to Paul is
[18:45] here today, Lord. You are here in our
[18:48] midst because you promised it. And Lord,
[18:49] we brought all our licks of fire
[18:51] together for one purpose, and that's to
[18:53] lift your name. Lord,
[18:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're here for that. Forgive us
[18:57] for apathy, Lord. It's a it's a spirit
[18:59] of the age. Son, all all of us fight it
[19:02] constantly. Lord, may you forgive us for
[19:04] it. For the Leodysian spirit of
[19:06] lukewarmness. Oh God, you're the king of
[19:10] Salem. You're the one that appeared to
[19:12] Abraham, that great Melzdc, Lord.
[19:14] Father, that's the one we're worshiping.
[19:17] We're not here to impress each other,
[19:19] Lord. But if the King of Kings is in our
[19:21] midst, how ought we to try and impress
[19:23] you, Lord?
[19:24] &gt;&gt; You're the one that took the price,
[19:26] Lord. You hung on that cross, nails
[19:28] ripping through your flesh, Lord.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; Father, you died the most horrible,
[19:32] horrific death for us. And Lord, that
[19:34] life that was in that blood that spilled
[19:36] on the earth redeemed everything in that
[19:39] earth and redeemed us all. Lord, we
[19:41] stand as redeemed before the Lord Jesus
[19:44] this morning. Receive our worship, Lord.
[19:47] Oh God, may it be a sacrifice, Lord. It
[19:49] is a sacrifice. It's something that we
[19:52] have to press into, Lord. That's true.
[19:54] But may you receive that sacrifice of
[19:56] praise from each lip here this this
[19:58] morning, Lord. Every heart, Lord. And
[20:00] Father, if there's somebody here that
[20:02] needs an extra, as it were, an extra
[20:04] dose of the Holy Spirit, Father, may you
[20:06] just do that for them, Lord.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; Father, may the worship, as we heard
[20:11] from our pastor with the with the youth
[20:13] night, how David could could with his
[20:16] music could set the the demons on on on
[20:20] flight. Lord, Father, may we realize
[20:22] that the spirit of music, the the love
[20:25] of you and the music together with our
[20:27] voices, Father, David could sit before
[20:30] Saul, a man possessed and and those
[20:32] demons would have to flee. Lord, may we
[20:35] may we do that. May we recognize with
[20:38] the power of our voice, with the desire
[20:40] and the spirit in us to worship you,
[20:42] what it can do. Lord, set the demons on
[20:44] on on a run. Lord, we we just rebuke
[20:47] every unclean spirit here this morning
[20:49] from us, Lord. May we we brought it in
[20:51] from this Leodysian world. Forgive us,
[20:53] Lord. But we we rebuke every unclean
[20:56] spirit in the name of the Lord Jesus
[20:58] that we could lift your name in worship
[21:00] the way you deserve to be. Grant these
[21:02] mercies, we pray. Receive our worship.
[21:05] We love you so much, Lord. We can only
[21:07] say that because you first loved us.
[21:10] Blessed be your name, Lord. Blessed be
[21:12] your name. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[21:13] Christ, we pray. Amen.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats tonight.
[21:20] Wonderful to be a Christian this
[21:21] morning.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; Why don't we let our praises
[21:25] &gt;&gt; and have it the praise may this building
[21:27] and have it to praise the people.
[21:30] Well, Lord, we bring to you our music
[21:37] in the best way.
[21:45] Oh, and we ask that you worship.
[21:52] Oh, as a dwelling
[21:55] place right now.

[32:59] Bless you. Let's bow our heads and

[33:04] Oh father,
[33:07] how we love you, Lord.
[33:11] Father, there is nothing in this world
[33:14] more worthy
[33:15] &gt;&gt; to be loved
[33:17] &gt;&gt; than you, Lord. Yes.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; We love you with all of our being, Lord.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; You came down, Father. You died for us,
[33:29] Lord.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; We accept it, Lord.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; We accept the benefits, Father, of it.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Not only that, Lord, you said you poured
[33:40] all of him in us.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; You come and you claimed us, Lord.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; That's why we love you, Lord.
[33:48] There's nothing else in this world,
[33:49] Father, that we desire to devote our
[33:52] whole lives, our whole beings,
[33:55] everything we say and do. Father,
[33:58] &gt;&gt; it's to show you that we love you.
[34:03] Forgive us, Father, of our mistakes,
[34:06] Father, and our failures. Lord, Father,
[34:09] that testimony is building in us that we
[34:11] do nothing. We say nothing unless first
[34:14] we see our husband say it first. We only
[34:17] do that which is pleasing to you. That
[34:18] is the testimony, Father, we desire to
[34:21] have in our lives, Father, Lord. And we
[34:24] know, Father, based on that testimony,
[34:26] the true revelation of that, Father,
[34:28] when it is fully revealed in us, Father,
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Father, we'll go home.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[34:34] &gt;&gt; we'll go home, Lord.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; We have to come to that realization,
[34:38] Father. And that is why we're here
[34:39] today, Lord, to once again hear the word
[34:42] of life broken, brought forth to us to
[34:45] eat and consume, to see it made manifest
[34:48] in our lives. Father, Lord, receive our
[34:50] worship, Father. Receive our praise.
[34:53] Thank you, Father, for the musicians and
[34:54] the song leaders, the trustees. Father,
[34:56] Lord, everyone that makes this so easy,
[34:59] Father, to just come, Father, and sit at
[35:02] your feet and worship freely all of the
[35:05] things that happen behind the scenes.
[35:06] Thank you, Father, for the human effort,
[35:08] Lord, knowing it's your spirit
[35:10] motivating and moving, Father. And we do
[35:12] it because we love you. And because we
[35:14] love you, Father, we love your body.
[35:17] Father, as a part of our worship and
[35:18] praise, Father, we bring our tithes and
[35:20] offerings, Father. Receive it, Father.
[35:23] Lord, bless us, Father, so we can give
[35:25] more, Lord, for your kingdom, Father,
[35:27] for your benefit, Lord. That is our true
[35:30] desire, Father, just to see your kingdom
[35:32] made manifest in the earth, Father.
[35:34] Lord, thank you, Father. We love you,
[35:36] Father. and we commit the remainder of
[35:37] this service into your hands. We welcome
[35:39] you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[35:41] Christ. Amen.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, his love.
[35:51] Oh, he takes
[35:54] good care
[35:55] of me.
[36:00] Oh yes, his love.

[43:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, my brother. Stand if you if
[43:22] you would. Don't you love the way he
[43:24] fathers you?
[43:25] &gt;&gt; You know, when we make mistakes,
[43:27] &gt;&gt; he's not like the world so often just
[43:29] puts it's like the devil puts his heel
[43:31] on your neck and just forces you down.
[43:33] Instead, he embraces you. He says, "Come
[43:36] on back.
[43:37] You're a prodal. Just come on back. I'll
[43:40] start running towards you before you
[43:43] start running towards me. I'll start
[43:44] running towards you." That's our God.
[43:46] That's the way he fathers us. Think
[43:48] about that this morning as we sing Jesus
[43:51] your name.
[43:54] Well, Jesus, your name
[43:58] is power.
[44:03] Jesus, your name
[44:06] is mine. And oh
[44:10] Jesus your name

[49:05] [Music]
[49:12] [Applause]
[49:13] Let's give him a hand of praise this
[49:15] morning.
[49:21] You know this week I was thinking about
[49:23] worship and asking myself why do we as
[49:27] humans have
[49:29] a nudge in us to worship and most of the
[49:32] time you realize that when we are in awe
[49:35] of someone their personality
[49:38] their abilities the things they can do
[49:41] that triggers worship.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; That's why people worship soccer stars.
[49:46] That's why people worship musicians
[49:48] because they do something that you're
[49:49] not able to do. But you compare what God
[49:53] is able to do
[49:54] &gt;&gt; and what God has done
[49:56] &gt;&gt; to what anyone can do. So if you're
[49:59] thinking about who who truly deserves
[50:02] worship
[50:04] &gt;&gt; is our father in heaven that truly
[50:05] deserves worship.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; May you help us to truly have that sense
[50:13] of worship. May you help us. May you
[50:16] bring us to the consciousness of what
[50:18] we're doing whenever we say that we're
[50:20] worshiping God. Welcome to church this
[50:23] morning. The Lord bless you. We thank
[50:25] the Lord for the privilege to be able to
[50:28] stand before you. We want to thank our
[50:31] pastor as well and want to thank
[50:32] everyone for coming. If you are not
[50:35] here, there will be no one to preach to.
[50:37] Let's just bow our heads for a word of
[50:39] prayer before we go into the word.
[50:42] Father, we are grateful for the
[50:44] privilege to be here.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; You said to Moses, "Gather the people
[50:50] together and I, the Lord, will give them
[50:53] water."
[50:55] We are here to step out of the way
[51:01] and we're asking you to take control
[51:04] this morning.
[51:06] Father, the thought you place in my
[51:08] heart
[51:09] for your people,
[51:12] I cannot deliver it myself.
[51:15] But when your spirit comes and delivers
[51:17] it there, Lord, it will meet every need.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; So I ask Lord Jesus that you take me out
[51:23] of the way.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; I ask Lord Jesus Christ that you take my
[51:27] senses out of the way,
[51:29] &gt;&gt; my thoughts, my memory, take it entirely
[51:32] out of the way. your people, Lord, that
[51:35] you will be speaking to, Lord. May you
[51:38] open up their hearts to receive from
[51:40] you.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; May you discern their thoughts by your
[51:43] word.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; May you, Lord Jesus, meet their needs
[51:47] according to your riches and glory.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; That at the end of this service, our
[51:51] testimony will be that the Lord was
[51:54] gracious to us. Let it be, Lord Jesus.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; We ask in your name, the Lord Jesus
[52:01] Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you
[52:04] musicians. The Lord bless you. If you
[52:07] quickly
[52:09] pick up your Bible, we'll uh take
[52:12] readings from three portions of the
[52:14] scripture.
[52:20] We'll start from Matthew chapter 6.
[52:24] All of these are familiar scriptures to
[52:26] us.
[52:30] Matthew chapter 6.
[52:33] I'm going to read from verse 7.
[52:43] This was the first sermon that Jesus
[52:45] Christ preached.
[52:47] And he has said a lot in chapter five
[52:49] and he get into chapter six talking
[52:52] about how we should pray and how we
[52:55] should not be like the hypocrites that
[52:59] try to stand and you know show everyone
[53:02] that they're praying
[53:04] talking about those that fast and how
[53:06] they try to let everyone see that
[53:08] they're fasting and then he started to
[53:12] speak to his disciples and tell them
[53:14] about how to pray. So I'll start from
[53:17] verse seven. It says, "But when ye pray,
[53:21] use not vain repetitions as the heen do,
[53:25] for they think that they shall be heard,
[53:27] for their much speaking.
[53:30] Be not ye therefore like unto them, for
[53:33] your father knoweth what things ye have
[53:37] need of
[53:38] &gt;&gt; before ye ask him."
[53:41] He then says, "After this manner,
[53:43] therefore, pray ye, our father, which
[53:46] art in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
[53:51] &gt;&gt; I'll be taking my title from the middle
[53:52] of that
[53:55] verse. My title is our father which art
[53:58] in heaven.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; So, it's a title you can never forget.
[54:02] If you want to remember, just remember
[54:04] the very first phrase of the Lord's
[54:07] Prayer. Let's turn to Ephesians chapter
[54:10] 6. We'll take the first four verses.
[54:16] And as we go on, you probably start to
[54:18] guess where we're going this morning.
[54:20] It's not so much about talking about
[54:22] prayer this morning. I'd asked brother
[54:25] Farah, brother John to sing that song
[54:28] that I have known for many years, but
[54:31] it's an expression of how God is a
[54:35] parent.
[54:37] And today we're going to be asking
[54:38] ourselves as parents, how are we
[54:41] parenting our children? I know the
[54:44] sisters talked about that yesterday,
[54:47] but just to be entirely open, this has
[54:50] been placed in my heart for about 6
[54:52] months and uh I knew the Lord at an
[54:55] appointed time and so this is the
[54:58] appointed time. Ephesians chapter 6
[55:00] verse 1-4.
[55:03] Paul speaking here says to the
[55:04] Ephesians, "Children, obey your parents
[55:07] in the Lord, for this is right.
[55:10] Horn thy father and mother, which is the
[55:13] first commandment with promise, that it
[55:17] may be well with thee, and thou mayest
[55:20] live long on the earth." Amen.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Now it says, "And ye fathers, provoke
[55:26] not your children to wrath, but bring
[55:29] them up in the nurture and admonition of
[55:33] the Lord."
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll quickly read the last
[55:36] scripture. Colossians chapter 3 verse 20
[55:39] and 21. Paul saying similar things to
[55:43] the church in Colossus.
[55:49] He said, "Children, obey your parents in
[55:51] all things, for this is well pleasing
[55:54] unto the Lord. Fathers, provoke not your
[55:58] children to anger, lest they be
[56:01] discouraged." May the Lord bless the
[56:03] reading of his word in Jesus name. Amen.
[56:06] Please have your seat.
[56:11] The first place we read in Matthew,
[56:12] Jesus Christ was speaking to his
[56:16] disciples and teaching them how to pray.
[56:18] And I was thinking about this. There are
[56:20] many ways Jesus could have taught us how
[56:23] to pray. There are many ways he could
[56:25] have taught us how to address the the
[56:27] the almighty God that we serve. He could
[56:30] have told us to say, "Oh Jehovah, oh
[56:32] mighty God." There's so many things um
[56:35] many ways all the seven redemptive names
[56:38] that that prayer could have been started
[56:40] with. But Jesus Christ was trying to
[56:43] point us to the relationship that we
[56:45] have with our heavenly father
[56:47] &gt;&gt; so that when we come to him we come with
[56:49] a consciousness
[56:51] of sunship. Amen.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; We come with a consciousness of being a
[56:56] child and we come with a consciousness
[57:00] of the responsibility that he has over
[57:03] us by being our father.
[57:06] Now we know that if we want to think
[57:08] about um perfection, God is the
[57:11] expression of perfection. So in any role
[57:14] we have in life, if you can find how God
[57:18] does it or you find how God did it, that
[57:21] will be the measure. Because if you keep
[57:24] reading on in um in in Matthew, I
[57:27] believe chapter 6, Jesus Christ started
[57:29] to tell, you know, um teaching the first
[57:32] principles of our our faith. He was
[57:34] telling the disciples, it said in
[57:36] chapter five, you know, the beatitudes
[57:38] and then in chapter six, telling us how
[57:39] to live our lives, the very basic
[57:42] things. If somebody ask you to go a
[57:43] mile, go two miles with them. But he
[57:46] stressed something. He hit something
[57:48] like as you continue to read down, he
[57:51] said that all the things I'm asking you
[57:53] to do, I'm just paraphrasing here. He
[57:55] said, "Do it because you are the
[57:58] children of your heavenly father."
[58:01] &gt;&gt; We're going to get into some of those
[58:02] things this this morning. And then we
[58:04] see Paul coming to, you know, he had
[58:07] Paul wrote a lot about mysteries as
[58:09] well.
[58:11] He told the people that there's certain
[58:13] things that God has shown him that has
[58:15] been hidden since the foundation of the
[58:17] world but now being revealed. But as
[58:20] Paul was teaching them and unveiling
[58:22] those mysteries to them, he was also
[58:24] telling them how to live their lives.
[58:28] Now, he was telling the fathers, he
[58:30] said, "Don't provoke your children to
[58:32] wrath."
[58:33] Um, and uh the word father, we're going
[58:36] to get to it. Um I'm not speaking to the
[58:38] fathers alone because the word can also
[58:40] translate to parents, right? Um
[58:43] Deuteronomy, you know, um Moses was
[58:45] speaking here. He said, "The secret
[58:47] things belong unto the Lord our God."
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; But those things which are revealed.
[58:54] Now those things when they are secret,
[58:57] they are mysteries.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Everybody agree?
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Are we in church this morning? Amen.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Are we in church this morning?
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; You know, when you say amen, it
[59:11] encourages the preacher. That's
[59:13] &gt;&gt; right.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; It makes them know that you are
[59:17] listening and uh it's it's getting it's
[59:20] coming across.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; So, Moses was saying that God has secret
[59:25] things, but God does not keep all of
[59:27] them secret.
[59:29] God reveals some of them. Now he tells
[59:32] us for what purpose?
[59:35] He said those things which God has
[59:37] revealed, they belong to us,
[59:41] &gt;&gt; right? And to our children forever.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; That we may do all the words of this
[59:48] law.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; There is a doing that comes after the
[59:52] revelation of the mysteries.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, brother Bram told us in a man
[59:57] running from the presence of the Lord,
[59:58] he said, "Dear Jesus," he was praying
[1:00:00] here, "help us tonight in this few
[1:00:02] words, as we wait upon thee, and we pray
[1:00:05] that your grace and mercy will be with
[1:00:07] us, Lord, and tender our hearts. Move
[1:00:11] back all the shocks and thorns, the
[1:00:13] thieves. Let the blessed sunshine of God
[1:00:16] fall in upon the word, Lord. And may we
[1:00:20] have such a great meeting till there
[1:00:22] will not be an unsaved person among us.
[1:00:25] All the children will be in the kingdom
[1:00:27] of God.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; He said those without the baptism of the
[1:00:30] spirit may they receive it. Father, you
[1:00:33] want to say amen this morning.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; He said may all the great mysteries
[1:00:38] the great mysteries that we are supposed
[1:00:41] to know in this age there are mysteries
[1:00:44] that were that were withheld in the time
[1:00:46] of John. that is for us to know in this
[1:00:49] age. And we believe that those mysteries
[1:00:51] have been revealed and whenever we come
[1:00:54] to church, whenever the pastor is
[1:00:55] preaching, whenever a minister is
[1:00:57] preaching, those mysteries have been
[1:01:00] unveiled personally to us. Now we need
[1:01:02] to understand the purpose for it. May
[1:01:04] all the great mysteries that we are
[1:01:06] supposed to know at this age, Lord, be
[1:01:08] unveiled to us and we will see the
[1:01:12] plainness of God
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; where God is no more a mystery to us.
[1:01:17] For what purpose? So that we'll know how
[1:01:19] to behave ourselves. It comes down to
[1:01:23] behavior.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; If I will go a little bit ahead of
[1:01:28] myself this morning, our behavior
[1:01:31] amongst our neighbors
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; who are the closest neighbors to us, our
[1:01:36] wife and children,
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; those are the closest neighbors to us.
[1:01:43] The reason why we have an edge over
[1:01:46] others, over the Pentecostals, over all
[1:01:49] the ages that were gone that did not
[1:01:51] know all the secrets of God that God
[1:01:53] withheld and was given to this age. It's
[1:01:56] not so that we are intellectual.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; It's not so that we can argue.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; It's not so that we can come and have a
[1:02:04] conversation with someone and show them
[1:02:06] how every scripture ties together. Those
[1:02:08] things are good. But the purpose for it
[1:02:11] as the prophet is telling us is that so
[1:02:13] that we'll know how to behave ourselves
[1:02:16] and act
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; action correcting ourselves and bringing
[1:02:21] the members of our body into discipline
[1:02:24] to the word.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; So we take all of that and we have to go
[1:02:31] and see how it applies to our behavior.
[1:02:35] And what that means is that our behavior
[1:02:37] should surpass the behaviors of those
[1:02:40] that did not know as much as we know.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Do we believe that?
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; That we might know how to live in this
[1:02:49] present day at the approaching of the
[1:02:52] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; This is a very common quote. Our pastor
[1:02:56] read it many times as we were going
[1:02:57] through the study of this church age
[1:02:59] book. Abraham said, "When the Methodists
[1:03:01] failed, God raised up others. And so it
[1:03:04] has gone on through the years until in
[1:03:07] this last day, there is again another
[1:03:10] people in the land who under their
[1:03:14] messenger
[1:03:16] will be the final voice to the final
[1:03:19] age."
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; How are we going to be the final voice
[1:03:23] to the final age?
[1:03:26] Is he about going to say that we believe
[1:03:28] a prophet that God sent a prophet? Let's
[1:03:31] see what brother Abraham said in the
[1:03:33] message revelation chapter 4 part three.
[1:03:36] He said he was talking about you know
[1:03:39] revelation where John said that um he
[1:03:41] heard the voice of God and then he heard
[1:03:44] thunderings. A brother was telling us
[1:03:45] that the voice of God means thunder like
[1:03:47] thunder when God speaks it thunders. Now
[1:03:50] he was saying that here he said all
[1:03:53] right here was voices.
[1:03:56] How we need in Jeffersonville
[1:03:59] thousands of lived voices.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Let's replace that with Calgary. How we
[1:04:04] need in Calgary thousands of lived
[1:04:07] voices. He didn't just call them voices.
[1:04:09] He called them lived voices
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; where the word is becoming flesh.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Right? The reason I'm going through this
[1:04:19] introductory part is just to set um um
[1:04:23] help us understand why we are going to
[1:04:25] look at the things we're going to look
[1:04:26] at this morning.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; How many parents are in the house?
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Okay. How many potential parents are in
[1:04:33] the house?
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; There are many potential parents. Right?
[1:04:37] So if you think it doesn't apply today,
[1:04:39] just note it down. And being a parent
[1:04:43] is not just being a dad or a mom.
[1:04:48] There are many non-dads and many
[1:04:50] non-Moms that are parents.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; And being a dad doesn't mean you're a
[1:04:56] father. Being a mom does not mean you
[1:04:58] are a mother. We're going to look at the
[1:05:01] definition of a father this morning. And
[1:05:03] you're going to see that it's much more
[1:05:06] than just giving birth to children.
[1:05:08] There are people that might not have had
[1:05:10] children in this world, but God has
[1:05:12] placed them in a role to father a child
[1:05:15] or to mother a child.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; But the Bible said, "We need in
[1:05:19] Jeffersonville thousands of lived
[1:05:20] voices, the thunder of God thundering
[1:05:24] out in sweetness and holiness."
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; So when we're talk you're talking about
[1:05:31] the mysteries, you're talking about the
[1:05:33] thunders, the the reality is those
[1:05:36] things are good. We need to know them
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; but it needs to do something in our
[1:05:41] lives.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; The raw material is the thunder.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; The final product is the lived voices.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; The way I'm living my life
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; now. Brother said sweetness and holiness
[1:05:57] purity undefiled lives walking around in
[1:06:01] earth today in the earth today without a
[1:06:04] blemish. He said, "Yes, sir. Real
[1:06:06] Christians, that's the thunder against
[1:06:09] the enemy. The devil don't care how loud
[1:06:13] you holler.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; The devil don't care how much you can
[1:06:17] jump or how much you can do this or
[1:06:20] shout, but what hurts the devil?"
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; How many people want to hurt the devil
[1:06:26] this morning?
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; How many people want to go back home and
[1:06:29] hurt the devil? The devil hurts us so
[1:06:31] bad.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't take a break from hurting
[1:06:33] the devil.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:36] because it doesn't take a break from
[1:06:37] hurting us.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Bram is telling us how to
[1:06:40] hurt the devil. What hurts the devil is
[1:06:43] to see that sanctified life,
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; holy life, consecrated to God,
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; say anything to him, call him anything,
[1:06:53] just as sweet as he can be and move
[1:06:56] right on.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh my, that throws him away.
[1:07:01] It throws the devil away." Why? That's
[1:07:03] the thunder that shakes the devil.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Now God is a father
[1:07:11] but God was not a father from the very
[1:07:14] start. Brother Bramble tell us that when
[1:07:15] God dwelt by himself when he was Elohim
[1:07:18] he had attributes in himself. He had a
[1:07:20] lot of attributes. He had the attribute
[1:07:22] of being a savior which is a potential
[1:07:25] of being a savior of being a healer of
[1:07:27] being a deliverer. But the conditions
[1:07:29] were not right for God to manifest those
[1:07:32] attributes.
[1:07:33] Every child has a potential to be an
[1:07:36] adult. A little baby has a potential to
[1:07:39] be a father someday. But if the
[1:07:41] conditions don't develop to that point,
[1:07:43] it's not possible for those potentials
[1:07:46] to finally be expressed. So that's how
[1:07:48] it was for God. And that's why God
[1:07:50] allowed the fall. So God allowed the
[1:07:53] fall. He allowed the fall to happen so
[1:07:55] he can be a savior. He allowed the fall
[1:07:57] to happen so he can be a healer. He
[1:07:59] allowed the fall to happen so he can be
[1:08:01] a deliverer. But he also allowed the
[1:08:04] fall to happen so he can father us.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; He was a father before the fall
[1:08:09] happened.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; But to be able to translate all the, you
[1:08:14] know, brother Paul was saying a few
[1:08:16] things after the song was sang this
[1:08:18] morning, just speaking from the lyrics
[1:08:20] of that song.
[1:08:22] But one of the things you realize that
[1:08:24] makes God a good father is the fact that
[1:08:27] we don't have to run back to him.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes,
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; the love is so strong.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; If the fall did not happen,
[1:08:38] we will still appreciate that God loves
[1:08:40] us.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; But we will not appreciate it to the
[1:08:42] extent that we appreciate it after we
[1:08:46] fell and he redeemed us.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; That's why the songwriter says that
[1:08:50] there is a song that holy angels cannot
[1:08:53] sing.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; The song called Amazing Grace, angels
[1:08:57] cannot relate to it. When we are singing
[1:08:59] the song of the redeemed, the angels
[1:09:02] will not be able to relate to it because
[1:09:04] they never fell. So our own type of love
[1:09:07] that we experienced from our father is
[1:09:09] much greater than their own love.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; If you never been a prodigal
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; that was welcome back home,
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; you never actually
[1:09:21] you've not known the extent to which
[1:09:23] that father can love.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Now, God had all these attributes, but
[1:09:28] the Bible will tell us in in in adoption
[1:09:31] number two. He said, he said, "Let me
[1:09:33] draw you a little illustration here."
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; It's good we go back. I believe I talked
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; on in a little bit the other night or
[1:09:41] struck it in Genesis 1st chapter 126
[1:09:44] when God called his name the Lord. It's
[1:09:48] in the word of Ela Elohim, which means
[1:09:53] the selfexisting one. Hallelujah.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; There was nothing else existed but him.
[1:09:58] There was no air. There was no lights.
[1:10:00] There was no stars. There was no wall.
[1:10:02] There was no nothing else. It was God
[1:10:04] and God alone. Ll Elohim. Now he made
[1:10:08] that inside of that was attributes
[1:10:12] which meant inside of this great LL
[1:10:16] Elohim was an attribute. You know what
[1:10:18] an attribute is or let me say it like
[1:10:19] this was a nature.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's so the little fellow will
[1:10:25] get it. I'm going I'm and I'm one of the
[1:10:28] little fellows that has got to get it
[1:10:30] that way. Inside of him was the nature
[1:10:33] to be a father.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Is self-existent. There ain't there
[1:10:38] ain't nothing for him to be a father by
[1:10:41] because at that time there was no he
[1:10:43] didn't have Adam. He didn't have Eve. So
[1:10:45] he was just by himself alone. There were
[1:10:47] no angels. So he could not be a father.
[1:10:49] And now down inside of that was
[1:10:51] something else that he was God and God
[1:10:54] is an object of worship but he was
[1:10:57] self-existent. Ll Elohim. So there was
[1:11:00] nothing to worship him inside of that.
[1:11:02] It was a savior and there was nothing to
[1:11:04] be saved. Inside of that he was a
[1:11:06] healer. See, but there was nothing sick
[1:11:08] to be healed. Wasn't nothing to be sick.
[1:11:11] Now do you get the picture? So his
[1:11:14] attributes,
[1:11:15] his nature produced what is today.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; So we can say here that God has
[1:11:24] demonstrated fatherhood.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Have we all experience the fatherhood of
[1:11:28] the father?
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Have we all experienced it?
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Now let's look at the word father. what
[1:11:33] it means in the uh lexicon uh the
[1:11:38] original word
[1:11:40] it's pronounced patai
[1:11:43] and it means it could be it could mean
[1:11:46] father it could mean heavenly father it
[1:11:49] could mean ancestor elder senior um
[1:11:54] Strong's exhaustive concordance would
[1:11:56] use the word father or parent
[1:11:59] and now this is where I want us to that
[1:12:03] you know I want us to pay attention. It
[1:12:05] says that father means one who imparts
[1:12:10] life
[1:12:11] and is committed to it. So he imparts
[1:12:16] life
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; and is committed to imparting life.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Now listen it said a progenitor
[1:12:23] bringing into being
[1:12:26] to pass on the potential for likeness.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. it brings into being to pass on
[1:12:34] the potential for likeness. I was on a
[1:12:37] call with my dad yesterday, my dad and
[1:12:39] mom yesterday and um I gave the phone to
[1:12:41] my son Matias and and my dad looked at
[1:12:44] him and said, "Hey, Matias, you're
[1:12:45] looking more like your dad now.
[1:12:49] Did I have to do anything to make my son
[1:12:51] look like me?
[1:12:54] Did I have to mold him in a certain way
[1:12:56] to make his face look like have my
[1:12:58] resemblance?" No.
[1:13:01] It's just that because it's my son, the
[1:13:03] potential is there.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; But as we start to talk about character,
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; I have work to do.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; So likeness is beyond looks.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Likeness comes down to character. So
[1:13:20] being a parent, we have the ability
[1:13:24] to bring into being
[1:13:27] to pass on the potential for likeness.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; We have the ability to transfer
[1:13:36] character
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; so that it can be carried on.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; That is why David could say that we have
[1:13:43] a goodly heritage.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; What's an heritage? Heritage is an
[1:13:48] inheritance. Something you've passed
[1:13:50] down from generation to generation. Our
[1:13:53] goodly heritage is not cars. It's not
[1:13:57] homes. It's is not material things as
[1:13:59] Christians. Our goodly heritage is to be
[1:14:02] able to pass on the Lord, the baptism of
[1:14:05] the Holy Ghost to our children.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; We can't give it to them, but we can
[1:14:09] create an atmosphere. We can do our part
[1:14:12] so that God can do his own part.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. The first time you will see in the
[1:14:18] Bible where God was referred to as a
[1:14:19] father is in Exodus 4:22.
[1:14:23] This is when he was telling Moses to go
[1:14:25] to Pharaoh and he said, "And thou shalt
[1:14:27] say unto Pharaoh, thus seeth the Lord,
[1:14:31] Israel is my son, even my firstborn." We
[1:14:36] know that brother Ram told us that Adam
[1:14:38] was a son. God will come and fellowship
[1:14:40] with Adam and Eve in the garden. We know
[1:14:42] that that that but the first time it was
[1:14:45] referred to as father where God will
[1:14:47] admit that I have a son. You find that
[1:14:49] in Exodus. Now let's start to look at
[1:14:51] God's approach to parenting.
[1:14:55] How does God parent us?
[1:14:57] The very first thing you find is God
[1:15:00] shows his children love and affection.
[1:15:05] Love and affection. I'm sorry. Sorry, I
[1:15:07] should have done a slide deck so that
[1:15:09] you can follow along. But I don't want
[1:15:12] to restrict myself so that the anointing
[1:15:14] can flow.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; So I mean but if you if you want like I
[1:15:19] I have the notes I can share. There's
[1:15:21] nothing that's that shouldn't be seen by
[1:15:23] anyone. So um I'm happy to share the
[1:15:25] notes after but you're welcome to take
[1:15:26] notes as well.
[1:15:29] So God shows his love and affection to
[1:15:31] his children. And we can see this know
[1:15:33] many places in the scriptures in Osir
[1:15:36] 11:1 he was talking about Israel and he
[1:15:39] said when Israel was a child then I
[1:15:41] loved him and called my son out of Egypt
[1:15:44] in 1 John 3:1 very common scripture said
[1:15:47] behold what manner of love the father
[1:15:50] had bestowed upon us that we shall be
[1:15:53] called the sons of god.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Isaiah tells us um can a woman forget a
[1:15:57] suckling child? God was saying, "I will
[1:16:01] not forget you." Even if a woman could.
[1:16:03] So, he's showing us love and affection.
[1:16:06] But the question is, how does God
[1:16:09] communicate love and affection?
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Now, God communicates love and affection
[1:16:17] through fellowship.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Now, brother said in the message,
[1:16:22] fellowship. He said, "Fellowship,
[1:16:24] wonderful thing." said, "Now, why does
[1:16:27] men like fellowship?
[1:16:29] Why is it men like to meet with men?
[1:16:32] Women meet with women. We all like to
[1:16:35] meet together. The ladies meet together
[1:16:38] and so and talk and the men go to the
[1:16:41] table and they have things in common
[1:16:42] that they like to talk about that come
[1:16:45] from somewhere." Brother Abraham is
[1:16:46] telling us that the desire we have to
[1:16:49] fellowship, no human is built to be an
[1:16:53] island. That's right. Right.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; No human is built to be an island.
[1:16:57] Right. We got to fellowship. Now,
[1:16:59] brother Abraham said that come from
[1:17:00] somewhere. What makes you love your
[1:17:03] children?
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; He said because you are a father.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; That's the strain, human strain. That's
[1:17:10] the reason it proves that we have a
[1:17:13] heavenly father that loves we his
[1:17:16] children. All the things is now made of
[1:17:20] things that was.
[1:17:23] All the things now made of things that
[1:17:24] was. The Bible said there's nothing new
[1:17:26] in the world. Now in the beginning when
[1:17:28] God made a man, he didn't make him to be
[1:17:31] sick.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; He didn't make him to have cancer. He
[1:17:35] never made him to die.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; He made him for fellowship.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; So our children were also made for
[1:17:43] fellowship.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Great.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. I'll take permission from my
[1:17:48] family. I might get a bit personal
[1:17:50] because I know the Lord has been dealing
[1:17:51] with me, you know, on this as well. So,
[1:17:54] I'm not coming to preach to people. I'm
[1:17:57] preaching to myself.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; And if the Lord gives you something from
[1:18:01] it, please take it.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; So, we try to get feedback from our
[1:18:06] children.
[1:18:08] Um, I never remembered anytime my
[1:18:10] parents did that with me. Call me into a
[1:18:12] room and say, "Tell, give me feedback
[1:18:13] about I'm parenting you."
[1:18:16] um it didn't happen and I don't I don't
[1:18:18] say that that was wrong. It's just times
[1:18:20] are different now. We we need to
[1:18:22] approach things differently.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; So we try to ask the kids, you know,
[1:18:26] give us feedback. What do you think we
[1:18:28] could do better? Um and one of the kids
[1:18:31] was telling my wife that I think we
[1:18:33] should have more family time.
[1:18:36] I think we should have more time. We
[1:18:38] should do more board games. And in my
[1:18:41] mind, I'm like,
[1:18:44] I thought he will want to have more
[1:18:46] screen time,
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; which they really do want to have. I
[1:18:52] mean, if you give them endless hours,
[1:18:54] they could be on screen, but brother
[1:18:56] Bram was telling us here that God made
[1:18:58] us for fellowship. Amen.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; And when we ignore them and give them
[1:19:03] all the screen time, don't ever think
[1:19:06] that deep down in their mind they don't
[1:19:08] want to spend time with dad and mom.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; I know our pastor has talked about that.
[1:19:13] I know that's the reason why he's away
[1:19:15] today, right? Fellowship.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Abraham said, now in the
[1:19:20] evening was talking about God and his
[1:19:22] children. God came down and had
[1:19:23] fellowship with Adam and Eve. They loved
[1:19:26] God. God loved them. He didn't want them
[1:19:29] to be sick, get old, and die. He wanted
[1:19:32] to be young and lovely forever. Wanted
[1:19:34] them to be young and lovely forever. But
[1:19:36] sin brought us here, not God. It's
[1:19:38] against God's will.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Now, we live in this modern world
[1:19:44] that doors everything to keep us from
[1:19:47] fellowshipping with our children.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Everything possible.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; We have bills to pay. We have work to
[1:19:56] do.
[1:19:58] When you're done working, there are
[1:20:00] things to do in the house. You you're
[1:20:03] you're spent by the end of the day.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Kids go to school, they come back, the
[1:20:09] day is over, and it repeats itself. When
[1:20:13] it's the weekend, you want to sleep in.
[1:20:18] So a lot of parents report that they
[1:20:21] feel time starved
[1:20:24] because of demanding work schedules
[1:20:28] and that leads to stress and reduces the
[1:20:31] quality time they have with children.
[1:20:34] And just to say fellowship does not mean
[1:20:37] being together in the same room.
[1:20:40] I think our world tells us that that is
[1:20:42] true because everyone can be in the same
[1:20:45] room but each one can be fellowshipping
[1:20:48] somewhere else
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; on their devices.
[1:20:54] So the model
[1:20:57] currents I don't know it's it's we're
[1:20:59] still like 21st century but when we
[1:21:02] bring it to this time and age this AI
[1:21:05] world whatever you call it the model
[1:21:08] family is a family that's sitting
[1:21:10] together in the same living room but
[1:21:12] everyone is on a device that is
[1:21:15] connecting them to someone else.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Fellowship means companionship.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. it and it also means company.
[1:21:27] Now
[1:21:29] people also talk about technology
[1:21:30] distractions. Of course the rise of
[1:21:32] smartphones and other devices has led to
[1:21:35] what is called tenno
[1:21:38] friends. Ten tech techno friends. Yeah.
[1:21:41] Where parents attention is divided
[1:21:43] potentially affecting the quality of
[1:21:46] interactions with their children. It's
[1:21:49] called techno friends. So pretty much
[1:21:51] what I is not conference conference is
[1:21:54] is different because conference you're
[1:21:56] together and you're having interaction
[1:21:59] together. Techno friends is half
[1:22:03] technology
[1:22:04] half conference. So divided attention.
[1:22:07] I'm in the room. My kids are speaking to
[1:22:10] me. I'm trying to answer them but I'm so
[1:22:14] locked up on my phone that I'm not
[1:22:17] actually listening to them.
[1:22:22] That is not God's approach to
[1:22:24] fellowship.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; That's not God's approach to parenting.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; A lot of parents also talked about
[1:22:30] perceived time
[1:22:32] deficits, which means never enough time
[1:22:36] in a day. And I can relate to that
[1:22:39] because I asked myself if I had 40 48
[1:22:42] hours in a day, it probably wouldn't
[1:22:43] still be enough cuz there's so much to
[1:22:45] do. There's work to do.
[1:22:48] Kids go for music. I have my music
[1:22:51] goals. I have to spend time with my
[1:22:54] wife. I have to spend time with family.
[1:22:55] There chores to do and you don't have
[1:22:58] enough time. Why am I bringing this?
[1:23:00] Because these are the battles that we
[1:23:03] fight every day.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Now know that God does not put this
[1:23:09] condition
[1:23:10] in place.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; It was not God's design.
[1:23:15] Brother Abraham told us that the
[1:23:16] advances of this world is the knowledge
[1:23:19] of the devil.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; He said is the god of this evil age
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; and Satan as we all agree his aim is to
[1:23:28] destroy families.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; That's Satan's aim. So whatever Satan
[1:23:33] can do to destroy families, as much as
[1:23:35] it looks like there are lots of benefits
[1:23:37] in it, remember it's the tree of good
[1:23:39] and evil, right? Looks like there's so
[1:23:41] many benefits in it. We can do our
[1:23:42] businesses better. There's so many
[1:23:44] things we can we can do better with
[1:23:46] technology, but let's not forget the
[1:23:49] fact that it's also taking us away from
[1:23:52] what is needful.
[1:23:58] Now, what is the implication of not
[1:24:00] having enough time with our children?
[1:24:02] Not having enough um quality time with
[1:24:06] children, it affects their emotional
[1:24:08] well-being.
[1:24:11] You know, I was in the US last year.
[1:24:14] Um, we had gone to speak for a brother
[1:24:16] in Florida who's a black American
[1:24:20] and I was in his truck. He was I don't
[1:24:23] know, he was probably taking me for
[1:24:25] lunch somewhere. And then he got a call
[1:24:29] and he answered the call. I think it was
[1:24:31] a missed call. There was a message that
[1:24:32] was left and then he turned to me and
[1:24:35] said, "Oh, that's my nephew. He's in
[1:24:37] prison.
[1:24:40] And
[1:24:44] I'd never been in the conversation that
[1:24:46] being in prison would have been said
[1:24:48] that casually.
[1:24:50] But if you look at the black American
[1:24:52] society or black American community in
[1:24:55] the states, one of the reason why you
[1:24:58] have a lot of them in prison, a lot of
[1:25:00] them doing bad stuff is lack of
[1:25:03] parenting.
[1:25:05] Many of them have been parented by
[1:25:07] single parents who have to go to work in
[1:25:09] the morning, don't come back till late
[1:25:12] and the children are left alone to do
[1:25:15] whatever they can do. Now when we are
[1:25:18] born as babies, we come into this world
[1:25:22] empty
[1:25:24] behaviorally.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Behaviorally, we are empty. We don't
[1:25:30] know how to behave. We don't know how to
[1:25:32] greet people. We we have nothing
[1:25:37] and depending on what is filled into
[1:25:39] that child that molds their character in
[1:25:43] the future.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:25:49] behavioral outcomes,
[1:25:52] you know, is also one of the things you
[1:25:53] see when we don't spend quality time
[1:25:55] with our children.
[1:25:58] the time we could have used to transfer.
[1:26:01] We're going to look at how children
[1:26:02] learn behaviors, but the time we could
[1:26:05] have used to transfer the right
[1:26:07] behaviors to them to mold them. And
[1:26:10] let's not forget, there is a time for
[1:26:12] molding.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; When you get a potter, when the potter
[1:26:17] is trying to mold the clay, he only
[1:26:20] molds it when it's pliable. He only
[1:26:22] molds it when it's soft. If he allows it
[1:26:25] to dry, he's got to crumble it
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; to build it up again.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; So God has given us as parents a huge
[1:26:36] responsibility.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; God has given us the responsibility of
[1:26:42] building another generation. Remember,
[1:26:46] Israel was in this position. At some
[1:26:48] point after they came into the promised
[1:26:51] land, after they got all their
[1:26:53] possession, after they settled down, God
[1:26:56] had told them from the time of Moses
[1:26:59] that all these things I'm giving unto
[1:27:01] you, pass it on down to your children.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't just tell them. Make it
[1:27:06] sign. Make it bracelets. Just do
[1:27:10] everything you can
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; to keep passing it on." Amen.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; But by the time we got to Judges, sadly,
[1:27:17] the Bible told us and there rose up
[1:27:20] another generation that knew not the
[1:27:23] Lord.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; And what did that lead to? Everybody
[1:27:27] started to do what was right
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; in their own eyes.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Not what was right before God,
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; but what was right in their own eyes.
[1:27:38] whatever was deposited into them was
[1:27:41] what they were able to display.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; But Ram said in be not afraid was
[1:27:46] talking about Susan Wesley. Says Susanna
[1:27:48] Wesley was the mother of 17 children.
[1:27:52] She didn't have no push button
[1:27:53] dishwashers and speakers to turn on to
[1:27:56] get water. And yet with all those
[1:27:59] children, she could spend two to three
[1:28:02] hours in a in a day in prayer around
[1:28:05] those 17 children. and said from that
[1:28:08] little nest of little birds came forth a
[1:28:10] John and a Charles.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; So what we are doing as parents today is
[1:28:16] investment.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; We are either investing the right things
[1:28:20] or investing the wrong things.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; And there is always a return on
[1:28:25] investment.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; If you don't invest, there's a return on
[1:28:29] not investing.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Maybe brother Joel can tell us more
[1:28:33] about that.
[1:28:35] But if you invest, there's always a
[1:28:37] return.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; And we don't always get the same. It
[1:28:40] also comes with how intentional you are.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; About your investment.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; The Ram said, "We need more mothers like
[1:28:50] that with time."
[1:28:56] How many mothers know that they don't
[1:28:57] have enough time? And fathers know they
[1:29:00] don't have enough time. I'll raise up my
[1:29:02] hand. But we've got to do all we can.
[1:29:05] We've got to deprioritize some certain
[1:29:08] things
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; so that we can spend more time with our
[1:29:13] children with time to teach their
[1:29:17] children about God.
[1:29:21] Another way we can see the God parents
[1:29:25] is through discipline and correction.
[1:29:30] Now what does discipline mean? The
[1:29:32] definition of discipline,
[1:29:36] it means control
[1:29:38] gained by enforcing
[1:29:41] obedience or order.
[1:29:44] The control that you gain. So it's a
[1:29:47] process of gaining control. If somebody
[1:29:50] says that you need to gain control, it
[1:29:53] means that you don't currently have
[1:29:56] control.
[1:29:58] So when we give birth to our kids, as
[1:30:00] they start to grow, they're totally
[1:30:02] dependent on us as babies. And as they
[1:30:04] start to grow and get to being becoming
[1:30:07] toddlers, this is my fourth experience
[1:30:09] of, you know, managing toddlerhood.
[1:30:14] When they become toddlers, they want to
[1:30:16] be in control.
[1:30:21] Remember I said that they don't know
[1:30:22] anything yet. They came empty. Right?
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; So if they try to be in control, but
[1:30:28] Abraham said power without character
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; is satanic.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Character is built over time.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Character takes time before you can say
[1:30:41] this person has now come to maturity.
[1:30:43] They have character. They cannot take
[1:30:46] decisions the right decisions. I'll say
[1:30:49] when character is not built yet. So
[1:30:52] discipline is a way to gain that
[1:30:55] control.
[1:30:58] Make sure that you are in control.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; It also means to orderly orderly or
[1:31:06] prescribed conduct or pattern of
[1:31:07] behavior and also means self-control.
[1:31:10] But in the context of what we're talking
[1:31:12] about this morning, control seems to be
[1:31:14] the most uh appropriate definition for
[1:31:16] it. Gaining control. Now if you look at
[1:31:19] the word correction,
[1:31:21] correction means the action or instance
[1:31:24] of correcting
[1:31:26] such as amendment,
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; rectification,
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; rebuke, punishment.
[1:31:34] It also means bringing into conformity
[1:31:39] with a standard.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; So you try to make someone conform to a
[1:31:44] standard.
[1:31:46] How many of us have pets?
[1:31:49] How many of us train our pets?
[1:31:52] Everyone, if you don't train your pets,
[1:31:53] you have too much work, right? Your dog
[1:31:56] will pee and poo on your carpet. You
[1:31:59] have to take it, clean it up. The smell
[1:32:00] will never go. Or maybe it might go if
[1:32:02] you spent a lot of money. But we try to
[1:32:05] train them
[1:32:07] so that they can come to a certain
[1:32:09] standard or the conformity to a certain
[1:32:13] standard.
[1:32:14] So you let him know that when you want
[1:32:16] to do the toilet, it doesn't happen in
[1:32:18] the house. When we go for a walk, that's
[1:32:20] when it happens. And after a while, the
[1:32:23] dog understands
[1:32:26] and they follow, they conform to that
[1:32:28] standard.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Now the word correction, as I was
[1:32:33] telling us, the meaning also pushed out
[1:32:34] the word punishment.
[1:32:37] And I decided to take a look at the word
[1:32:39] punishment. Punishment means training
[1:32:42] that corrects.
[1:32:45] So when you punish a child, you are
[1:32:47] training because there's some there are
[1:32:49] certain things we probably do. Well, I
[1:32:51] experienced that I can't agree there was
[1:32:52] punishment. Let's look at the purpose of
[1:32:55] punishment.
[1:32:56] Is the training that corrects,
[1:32:59] molds
[1:33:01] or perfects the mental faculties
[1:33:05] or moral character.
[1:33:08] Right? So we were not born with the
[1:33:11] perfect level of u mental faculty or
[1:33:15] moral character. We like I said we're
[1:33:17] born empty. Our kids were born empty. So
[1:33:19] we have to train them up. We have to
[1:33:22] guide them to the path that is right if
[1:33:25] we want them to end up well.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; And that's how God does.
[1:33:31] So 2 Samuel 7:14
[1:33:35] God was speaking to David about Solomon.
[1:33:38] God says, "I will be his father and he
[1:33:42] shall be my son.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; If he commits iniquity,
[1:33:49] I will chasten him."
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; If he does what is wrong, I will correct
[1:33:58] him.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; If he does what is wrong, I will chasten
[1:34:01] him. The word chastin means to correct.
[1:34:05] Reciprocally to argue, concessively to
[1:34:08] decide, justify or convict. Appoint,
[1:34:12] argue, chest, convince, correct,
[1:34:14] correction, daysmen, dispute, judge,
[1:34:18] maintain, plead, reason or reason
[1:34:22] together. Rebuke, reprove.
[1:34:27] So there are many many ways when we
[1:34:29] start to look at chastening. There are
[1:34:32] many many ways. Sometimes is actual
[1:34:35] outright rebuke. Sometimes is reasoning
[1:34:39] together. God told Israel come let us
[1:34:43] reason together. We're going to see how
[1:34:46] brother advised us to deal with certain
[1:34:49] age group of ch
[1:34:51] um as we go along. Hebrews 12 7-9 Bible
[1:34:56] tells us God dealeth with you as with
[1:34:59] sons. He for a prophet that we might be
[1:35:03] partakers of his holiness.
[1:35:06] Malachi 1:6
[1:35:09] the Lord was speaking through the
[1:35:10] prophet Malachi and demanding horner
[1:35:13] from the children of Israel said a son
[1:35:15] honorth his father. If I then be a
[1:35:17] father where is my horner?
[1:35:20] Ram told us in the end time evangelism
[1:35:23] he said and all that go all that go with
[1:35:26] God has trials
[1:35:29] your faith is tried when you start to
[1:35:31] live for him then every neighbor's going
[1:35:33] to talk about you
[1:35:35] everything is going to go wrong for you
[1:35:39] wow nobody said amen
[1:35:44] when we say everything is going to go
[1:35:45] right we want to say amen
[1:35:47] but sometimes God intentionally ally
[1:35:50] allows things to go wrong for you for a
[1:35:54] purpose. Why? Just remember that for
[1:35:56] it's God trying you.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; The Bible said every son that cometh to
[1:36:02] God must first be proven.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; He said
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; character is not a gift.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Character is what? Victory.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; What? What does that mean? you win
[1:36:19] character.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; You've got to fight to be able to come
[1:36:22] to the level of character
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; because by default you don't want
[1:36:27] character
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; or you want the wrong character by
[1:36:30] default. We were born in sin, were
[1:36:32] shaped in iniquity. We came to this
[1:36:34] world speaking lies. You don't need to
[1:36:37] teach a little child how to tell a lie.
[1:36:40] Their nature makes them do it.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; When they think they're going to be
[1:36:43] punished for something, they tell a lie
[1:36:44] because they want to escape. It's fight
[1:36:46] or flight.
[1:36:48] Right? They want to escape that
[1:36:49] punishment. They tell a lie. So if we
[1:36:52] follow our natural way, if you just
[1:36:55] leave a child to go by his way, he's
[1:36:57] going to end up wrong.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; And God also does not want us to just go
[1:37:02] our way. God wants to make sure that we
[1:37:06] are trained so that we can have
[1:37:08] character. Must be proven, chastening,
[1:37:11] child trained. Brother said like my
[1:37:14] daddy trained me when I done wrong. They
[1:37:17] had ten commandments
[1:37:20] hanging up over the door.
[1:37:23] Said he was a limp about this long and
[1:37:26] Mr. Brown was a pretty good man in his
[1:37:28] arm and he took us out and trained us.
[1:37:34] If you don't know what that is kids, it
[1:37:36] means spanking.
[1:37:39] Now, I'm not here to tell you how to
[1:37:40] train your kids, but one thing I'll tell
[1:37:43] you is whatever you are doing,
[1:37:46] are you the one in control or that child
[1:37:48] is still in control?
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Whatever you're doing, is it helping you
[1:37:55] to be in control?
[1:37:58] When you give an instruction to the
[1:37:59] child and the child definitely tells
[1:38:02] you, "I'm not going to do it," then that
[1:38:05] child is in control.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:38:08] That's right.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; So, think about what you do. I'm not
[1:38:11] here to tell you spank your kids, don't
[1:38:13] spank your kids. It's it's between you
[1:38:15] and God.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; But let's remember, you've got to be in
[1:38:22] control.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Abraham said that's the way God does. He
[1:38:27] tries, child trains you, brings you up
[1:38:31] because you're his child. There's
[1:38:33] something in the future for you. Amen.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; There's something in the future for you.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; When God is training us, God is not
[1:38:42] looking at today, God is thinking about
[1:38:45] the future. Is the same thing we tell
[1:38:47] our kids. I tell my kids when I'm
[1:38:49] training you. Some of them I tell them,
[1:38:52] see, if you wake up late for school,
[1:38:57] you're going to wake up late for work.
[1:39:00] If you keep waking up late for work,
[1:39:01] you're going to get fired.
[1:39:04] If you're you're fired, you won't have
[1:39:06] no money and you'll be able to make ends
[1:39:08] meet. So, I'm training you now for the
[1:39:11] future. Just like my parents trained me
[1:39:14] for my future.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; All of us here, whatever character we
[1:39:18] had, it was the the parenting that we
[1:39:21] got, whether that was from our actual
[1:39:23] parents or from someone else that was a
[1:39:25] parent figure in our lives.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; And that's the same thing God does.
[1:39:29] Brother Aram said, "He trains you
[1:39:32] because you're his child. There's
[1:39:34] something in the future for you. Home in
[1:39:36] glory and it trains you." Now, every son
[1:39:40] must be tried. So, like I said before,
[1:39:44] our kids are born empty
[1:39:46] and we've got to mold them.
[1:39:52] So, how do kids learn good behaviors?
[1:39:55] How do we make them learn good
[1:39:57] behaviors? I'm not a behavioral
[1:40:00] scientist,
[1:40:02] but I work in I've been in human
[1:40:06] resources for about 20 years and part of
[1:40:09] my work requires to understand people's
[1:40:12] behaviors. When a company is trying to
[1:40:15] select someone, I know everyone here
[1:40:16] that's been interviewing past few years
[1:40:19] or even more, you hear a lot about
[1:40:21] behavioral interviews, right? In the
[1:40:25] past, we used to have situational
[1:40:26] interviews. Sorry, I'm getting a bit
[1:40:28] technical but it might help someone
[1:40:30] where you ask somebody tell me if you
[1:40:34] have ever done this and someone can just
[1:40:37] make it up and tell you what they have
[1:40:39] done. But behavioral interviews will ask
[1:40:43] the question differently. It will say
[1:40:46] give me a situation where you had to do
[1:40:49] this.
[1:40:51] Right? So you have to actually
[1:40:54] demonstrate behavior,
[1:40:57] right? So our kids as well, they born
[1:41:01] empty, but they learn behaviors as they
[1:41:03] grow. So in what ways do they learn
[1:41:06] behavior?
[1:41:07] One of it is modeling,
[1:41:10] which means observing and imitating. And
[1:41:14] they start that from when they're born.
[1:41:17] As long as their eyes are open, they
[1:41:18] already start to observe. And though
[1:41:21] they might not imitate, but they're
[1:41:22] recording it. That's why sometimes you
[1:41:24] hear your toddler say something, you're
[1:41:26] like, "Really? I didn't know you could
[1:41:28] speak that that good English, right?
[1:41:30] Because they've been they've been
[1:41:31] keeping it or you see expressions on
[1:41:33] their faces, you know, the the way they
[1:41:36] are going they they they like express
[1:41:39] some things. Maybe they're talking and
[1:41:40] then they show some certain expressions
[1:41:42] and you're like, "This is still a child.
[1:41:44] How are you able to do that?" They are
[1:41:46] observing and they are imitating.
[1:41:50] So kids learn by watching adults and
[1:41:52] pairs. They observe what others do and
[1:41:55] the outcomes of it. They try to see
[1:41:59] whether you get rewarded or whether you
[1:42:01] get punished. If they know that what you
[1:42:04] did led to a reward, they want to model
[1:42:08] after it. If they know that what the
[1:42:10] person did led to punishment, they want
[1:42:12] to um avoid doing that.
[1:42:16] Another way that kids learn is
[1:42:17] reinforcement,
[1:42:20] which
[1:42:22] I know this is the word that we use when
[1:42:24] we train our pets, right? Treats. Why do
[1:42:26] you give treats? It's positive
[1:42:29] reinforcement. You're trying to tell
[1:42:31] that pet that what you did, I like it. I
[1:42:35] want you to continue to do it. So, we do
[1:42:37] that with our kids as well. There's
[1:42:38] positive reinforcement. There's negative
[1:42:40] reinforcement as well. Consequences for
[1:42:43] bad behavior. When you do what is not
[1:42:46] right, if a parent tells the child,
[1:42:48] "This is what I've asked you to do." If
[1:42:50] the child does not do it and there are
[1:42:53] no consequences, you're not modeling the
[1:42:56] right behavior.
[1:42:58] We are learning from the way God does
[1:43:00] his things, right? You're going to see
[1:43:02] all of this from the scriptures and from
[1:43:04] things with the ram um shared with us.
[1:43:06] There's also classical conditioning
[1:43:09] which talks about association
[1:43:12] um between certain behaviors and
[1:43:14] emotional experiences. Um so like
[1:43:18] sequencing of things. So if a child if
[1:43:20] they know that um once they're done
[1:43:22] brushing their teeth then they're going
[1:43:25] to be told a bedtime story that
[1:43:27] motivates them to brush their teeth at
[1:43:29] at at night so that they can get the
[1:43:32] bedtime story. There's also attachment
[1:43:34] and emotional bonding which um as we
[1:43:39] take care of our children their
[1:43:40] emotional
[1:43:42] um attachment that they have to us that
[1:43:45] becomes a reward for the type of
[1:43:47] behaviors we're trying to promote.
[1:43:51] And then sometimes we struggle with kids
[1:43:54] not having the right behaviors. And this
[1:43:57] is one of the things that I know most
[1:43:58] parents are very frustrated about. when
[1:44:01] you continuously correct your child will
[1:44:04] they continuously do what you tell them
[1:44:06] not to do.
[1:44:08] Now, one of the things that we don't do
[1:44:11] when we're correcting our kids and
[1:44:13] observing their reaction to our
[1:44:15] correction is we don't go back to when
[1:44:19] we were kids and try to think like them.
[1:44:23] We don't do that. I'm not saying that we
[1:44:24] ought to do that. It's we have just
[1:44:26] passed that stage. We we are past it.
[1:44:28] We're gone. I'm speaking to you as an
[1:44:30] adult and I expect you to do what I what
[1:44:33] I'm telling you to do. And one of the
[1:44:34] things I realized as well is that most
[1:44:38] of we parents
[1:44:40] parents the way we were parented,
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; That's usually the default because
[1:44:48] that's the only way we have learned
[1:44:50] parenting.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; My grandfather was very strict. My
[1:44:55] grandfather, my father told me and I
[1:44:57] well I met my grandfather. He was a
[1:44:59] disciplinarian.
[1:45:01] My dad told us a story of one day he was
[1:45:04] just standing he had done nothing wrong.
[1:45:07] Absolutely nothing wrong. My grandfather
[1:45:10] was coming just hit him on the at the
[1:45:11] back of his head. Pam and my grandmother
[1:45:14] was like why will you do that? And he
[1:45:16] said I want him to be at alert.
[1:45:21] So you have people who have gone through
[1:45:23] like that military approach and by
[1:45:27] default my dad was moving that way but
[1:45:29] my dad never was never as bad as my
[1:45:32] grandfather. That's why I'm not as bad
[1:45:33] as my dad. So it's it's toning down as
[1:45:37] you come down the generations.
[1:45:39] But you realize that as you are
[1:45:41] parenting your kids, you find yourself
[1:45:43] doing exact same thing that you
[1:45:45] criticized your parents about
[1:45:48] because that is what you have learned to
[1:45:50] be parenting.
[1:45:52] So when we are correcting our kids um
[1:45:55] behavioral scientists have taken a look
[1:45:57] at why sometimes our kids are not as
[1:46:00] responsive as we want them to be. So
[1:46:04] kids they say that they have
[1:46:06] underdeveloped prefrontal cortex which
[1:46:10] is the part of the brain that is in
[1:46:12] charge of self-control,
[1:46:15] judgment and impulse regulation. So in
[1:46:19] children those part of our brain are
[1:46:21] still immature and is continuing to
[1:46:24] develop as they get into early
[1:46:26] adulthood.
[1:46:28] So kids you find them acting on impulse
[1:46:32] um because if they are going to
[1:46:35] demonstrate good behavior they have to
[1:46:38] have some level of cognitive control to
[1:46:41] be able to um demonstrate that but that
[1:46:44] is still under construction.
[1:46:46] Another thing you find in kids is
[1:46:48] something called
[1:46:50] egoentrism where young children they say
[1:46:54] especially under the age of seven are
[1:46:57] naturally egoentric and they struggle to
[1:47:01] see perspective outside of their own. So
[1:47:04] they want to do something that's exactly
[1:47:05] what they want to do. It's hard for you
[1:47:07] to explain why they shouldn't do it. And
[1:47:10] many of us you know our parents our
[1:47:12] children sorry always ask the question
[1:47:14] why. Um, I couldn't ask my parents some
[1:47:17] of those wise, but you tell them to do
[1:47:20] something. If I asked the why,
[1:47:23] I would have been too scared of the
[1:47:25] consequence to ask the why because some
[1:47:28] wise just you get a you get a slap and
[1:47:31] then you know that you shouldn't ask
[1:47:32] why. Um, but our children are I mean
[1:47:36] it's a different generation and we can't
[1:47:37] approach things the same way. There are
[1:47:40] basic things that are principles that we
[1:47:42] cannot change but our approach can be a
[1:47:45] little bit different as we you know um
[1:47:47] adjust to the times that we're living
[1:47:49] in. But our children want to know why
[1:47:52] especially at a certain age they want to
[1:47:53] know why they are egocentric. They they
[1:47:56] think about themselves first and maybe
[1:47:57] just themselves. Um and that can make
[1:48:01] them start to look selfish or rude when
[1:48:04] you speak with them. Um but we need to
[1:48:06] understand that they are still
[1:48:08] developing right. Um there's also the
[1:48:11] triad at error learning.
[1:48:15] Children naturally test boundaries.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; They don't stay in the middle.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; They try to go as far as they can.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; They try to test boundaries. Try to see,
[1:48:30] you know, am I meant to go more than I'm
[1:48:32] supposed to go? So um because they're
[1:48:36] naturally curious and they explore by
[1:48:40] pushing limits
[1:48:42] because they are still in that stage of
[1:48:46] they have the appetite for learning.
[1:48:49] They have the biggest appetite for
[1:48:51] learning and one of the ways to learn is
[1:48:53] to go as far. Don't restrict yourself.
[1:48:56] That's why when you buy a new gadget,
[1:48:59] you bring it into the house, you're
[1:49:00] still trying to figure it out, your son
[1:49:02] comes and says, "Oh, mommy, this gadget
[1:49:04] can do this." And like, "How did you
[1:49:06] know?" Well, I read the instructions.
[1:49:08] Well, you that bought it didn't read the
[1:49:09] instruction,
[1:49:11] but they want to know. So, they are
[1:49:12] pushing themselves. They're pushing
[1:49:14] limits. And that might also like in a
[1:49:17] negative way um restrict them from
[1:49:21] modeling the right behaviors as quickly
[1:49:23] as we want them to. There's also the
[1:49:25] lack of socialization which you know um
[1:49:28] social norms and moral values you have
[1:49:32] to develop them over time.
[1:49:35] Many times we tell our kids somebody you
[1:49:37] just got there you're supposed to tell
[1:49:39] them good morning.
[1:49:41] They don't they're not born with that.
[1:49:44] They have to learn. We have to reinforce
[1:49:46] and reinforce and reinforce and be
[1:49:48] patient with them because one day they
[1:49:52] will get it. Sometimes, you know, look
[1:49:54] at when we talk about potty training and
[1:49:58] sometimes we get anxious like, oh, he's
[1:50:00] already three. He's not potty trained.
[1:50:02] I'm like, you would never see a
[1:50:03] 5-year-old that is still using diapers
[1:50:06] unless there's something wrong with
[1:50:07] them,
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; right? So, children develop at different
[1:50:11] paces
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; and we've got to be patient with them.
[1:50:14] Now, when you're correcting your
[1:50:16] children, I also trying to find out
[1:50:18] because this was a question I had.
[1:50:19] what's actually going on in their mind
[1:50:22] when you're correcting them. Um, and
[1:50:26] sometimes when we correct our children,
[1:50:27] they can feel confused or conflicted if
[1:50:31] what they did felt natural or rewarding
[1:50:33] to them, right? They had spent 5 hours
[1:50:36] on screen and you come back home and
[1:50:38] like so you've been on screen all the
[1:50:40] chores I asked you to do. Why didn't you
[1:50:42] why didn't you do it? And when you
[1:50:43] correct them, they give you the face,
[1:50:46] right?
[1:50:48] But what is actually happening at that
[1:50:50] time is because their level of
[1:50:51] understanding is very different from
[1:50:53] your level of understanding they are not
[1:50:55] able to
[1:50:58] um see why you are correcting them. So
[1:51:02] and depending on our tone
[1:51:05] and the consistency of correction
[1:51:09] that's one of the things that will bring
[1:51:11] results. I remember a couple years ago
[1:51:15] I was away. My wife had the family hotel
[1:51:19] with the kids and she did I think she
[1:51:22] was the one that did the first feedback
[1:51:24] session
[1:51:26] and and the kids she told them write
[1:51:28] down the things you want daddy to stop
[1:51:30] doing.
[1:51:32] And I don't know maybe one or two of
[1:51:34] them wrote that we want daddy to stop
[1:51:35] yelling at us.
[1:51:39] And I took it
[1:51:42] and I tried to
[1:51:44] hopefully I don't yell anymore. Maybe
[1:51:46] it's just a few times.
[1:51:48] But I I took that feedback because I
[1:51:50] felt
[1:51:52] I'm not achieving anything by yelling.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Cuz when you start to yell, they just
[1:51:59] put a blocker.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; And communication is supposed to be two
[1:52:04] ways.
[1:52:07] So depending on the tone of our
[1:52:10] correction, we might achieve stuff
[1:52:12] faster or slower.
[1:52:16] There's also the internalization process
[1:52:18] where young children
[1:52:21] normally they would obey to avoid
[1:52:25] punishment at the early stages before
[1:52:27] this is internalized.
[1:52:29] But when kids are doing something just
[1:52:32] for the sake of conformity,
[1:52:35] it is dangerous.
[1:52:37] Because when they have their freedom,
[1:52:40] they will do just what they wanted to
[1:52:42] do. So we need to ask ourselves the
[1:52:44] question, are my kids obeying today just
[1:52:48] because they're trying to conform?
[1:52:51] And I can say this from a first person
[1:52:54] experience. I always say, I'm sorry if
[1:52:57] this sounds a little bit disagreeable,
[1:53:00] but I always say that those of us that
[1:53:02] grew up in the message should better
[1:53:05] understand our kids that are growing up
[1:53:07] in the message
[1:53:10] because our struggles are similar.
[1:53:13] The reason I'll say that is when our
[1:53:16] parents came from Pentecostalism or the
[1:53:19] world into the message, they repented.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Their lives were changed. They came in,
[1:53:25] they had the passion, they ran with this
[1:53:27] message. Those of us that were born into
[1:53:29] it. We didn't have the chance. We were
[1:53:32] just told. I always try to relate it to
[1:53:34] the journey of the children of Israel.
[1:53:36] And the three generations you'll find in
[1:53:38] that journey. You have the generation of
[1:53:39] Moses. You have the generation of
[1:53:41] Eleazar, the son of Aaron. You have the
[1:53:43] generation of Phineas. Now, Phineas was
[1:53:47] about maybe a toddler or two years old
[1:53:50] from historians. When they left Egypt,
[1:53:52] Phineas had no opportunity to eat
[1:53:54] cucumbers and onions and all the things
[1:53:57] that those middle class were craving for
[1:54:01] and saying want to go back to Egypt to
[1:54:02] eat. He always ate mana
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; because that was what was fed through
[1:54:07] the wilderness.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; So we always ate the message but we did
[1:54:10] not eat it with revelation
[1:54:13] until God came and revealed himself
[1:54:15] personally to us. Amen.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Alistister was preaching some
[1:54:21] time ago
[1:54:23] and he said growing up in the message he
[1:54:24] used to ask himself what should I repent
[1:54:26] of?
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; I do everything right.
[1:54:31] So when my parents were telling me to
[1:54:32] repent I didn't understand. I've not
[1:54:36] done anything wrong. You're asking me to
[1:54:37] repent. So first time I went for water
[1:54:39] baptism, I went because my friends went
[1:54:42] for water baptism.
[1:54:44] Because truly I I I listen to everything
[1:54:47] they tell me. I go to school, I do the
[1:54:48] right thing. Before I got to the point
[1:54:50] where all I have been doing through the
[1:54:52] years, I realized it was just trying to
[1:54:54] conform.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; And the danger of conformity is when you
[1:54:57] now get to the place where you don't
[1:55:00] have that protection,
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; then your real self shows up. Amen.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; So we have to understand as our kids are
[1:55:10] internal internalizing the um going
[1:55:12] through internalization of the things we
[1:55:14] are teaching them. We have to be sure
[1:55:16] that they understand
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; and they feel safe as well. One of the
[1:55:20] things I lately told our kids is if you
[1:55:22] do anything wrong don't think you will
[1:55:24] do something that is so bad that you
[1:55:26] cannot tell dad and mom
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; because regardless of what you go
[1:55:30] through I've gone through it before.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Mom has gone through it before. So
[1:55:34] always have the freedom. We have an open
[1:55:37] door policy. Come and tell us. We are
[1:55:41] telling you do what is right. But in
[1:55:43] case you are not able to do it
[1:55:46] like we we heard this morning, the
[1:55:49] father comes after us.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; He doesn't forsake us. He doesn't push
[1:55:54] us away. He doesn't disown us
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; regardless of what we did. If we are
[1:56:00] learning from his parental attributes,
[1:56:03] we've got to let our kids know the same.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Kids also go through em emotional
[1:56:09] regulation and frustration.
[1:56:11] Um their emotional brain often reacts
[1:56:14] faster than their logical brain. So they
[1:56:17] they're more on the emotional side than
[1:56:20] the logical side. Um which when they're
[1:56:22] corrected, they might feel very
[1:56:24] overwhelmed. They might feel defensive.
[1:56:26] And that's why our approach to
[1:56:28] correction, we have to watch it as well
[1:56:30] because many times the way we correct
[1:56:31] our kids is out of frustration.
[1:56:34] Now, I don't know if I'm there yet, but
[1:56:38] I'll just bring that up. There's a
[1:56:40] scripture that I read
[1:56:44] and
[1:56:47] I said, "Lord, help me." And we will get
[1:56:49] to that. Um, so we we we can look at how
[1:56:53] God approached the children of Israel
[1:56:55] and all the troubles that they gave God
[1:56:57] and Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
[1:57:00] You can look at how um the psalmist um
[1:57:04] chronicled that in Psalms 78 and 106.
[1:57:07] But you will see that God always
[1:57:11] longsuffered with them. God was
[1:57:14] long-suffering with them. I try to to
[1:57:17] see when was the first time that God
[1:57:19] gave the children of Israel a spanking.
[1:57:21] So there there were there were judgments
[1:57:23] that happened like those that you know
[1:57:26] um were when they had the golden calve
[1:57:30] and how Moses came down and saw that
[1:57:32] they had the golden calf and Moses said
[1:57:34] it was on the Lord's side and told the
[1:57:35] priest and he killed 3,000. But I I was
[1:57:38] looking specifically at how God when God
[1:57:41] reacted based on their complaint. So the
[1:57:44] first complaint that the children of
[1:57:46] Israel um gave before God was right
[1:57:48] after they came out of you know the the
[1:57:51] um crossed the Red Sea. Of course at the
[1:57:53] Red Sea they already complained and said
[1:57:54] oh you want to kill us let us go back to
[1:57:56] Egypt um why did you bring us here but
[1:57:59] as they crossed the Red Sea Exodus 15
[1:58:03] they couldn't find water. The water they
[1:58:05] found was bitter. So at the water of at
[1:58:08] at at the at the um water of Mara they
[1:58:12] complained. God did not spank them. God
[1:58:14] did not scold them. God just told Moses,
[1:58:17] "You take this wood, put it in that
[1:58:19] inside the water. The water will be
[1:58:20] sweet and they can drink." When they got
[1:58:23] to the wilderness of sin, there was no
[1:58:25] food. They complained again. All the
[1:58:28] food we brought, we run out. What are
[1:58:30] you doing about it? And then God didn't
[1:58:33] tell Moses. He didn't he didn't punish
[1:58:34] them. He didn't do anything. He just
[1:58:36] told Moses, "Don't worry. Tell them I'm
[1:58:38] going to give them enough food. They're
[1:58:40] going to eat it till it's going to come
[1:58:41] out of their nose. I'll give them mana.
[1:58:44] I'll give them quills." And God did
[1:58:46] that. Now, they got to the um refidim
[1:58:51] and they also did not have water to
[1:58:54] drink. So, of course, they've left the
[1:58:55] waters of Mara. They've journeyed. They
[1:58:57] couldn't be of course carry enough water
[1:59:00] that will take them through. They got
[1:59:02] there and they couldn't find water to
[1:59:04] drink. And God just told Moses, "You
[1:59:05] know what? Just smite the rock and they
[1:59:07] will get water."
[1:59:09] Now, the first time that God reacted to
[1:59:12] their disobedience
[1:59:14] was when they got to Tabera.
[1:59:18] Numbers 11:1. And when the people
[1:59:20] complained,
[1:59:22] it displeased the Lord. And the Lord
[1:59:26] heard it, and his anger was kindled.
[1:59:30] And the fire of the Lord burnt among
[1:59:31] them and consumed them that they that
[1:59:34] that were in the uttermost parts of the
[1:59:36] camp.
[1:59:38] So God was longsuffering with them.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; God showed compassion.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; God showed pity.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; In correction there has to be
[1:59:49] compassion.
[1:59:52] Now um
[1:59:56] yes. So in Hebrews Paul was writing this
[2:00:00] Hebrews 12 7-10
[2:00:04] he was talking about how God deals with
[2:00:06] us. He said if ye endure chastening God
[2:00:10] dealeth with you as with sons for what
[2:00:13] son is he whom the father chasteneth
[2:00:16] not? But if ye be without chastisement
[2:00:19] whereof all are partakers then ye are
[2:00:21] bastards and not sons. Furthermore we
[2:00:24] have our fathers of our flesh. This is
[2:00:25] where I'm going. Which corrected us and
[2:00:29] we gave them reverence. Shall we not
[2:00:33] shall we not much rather be in
[2:00:35] subjection unto the father of spirits
[2:00:37] and leave? He said, "For they our
[2:00:40] earthly fathers and this speaks to us as
[2:00:41] parents for a few days chasind us after
[2:00:45] their own pleasure." And this might mean
[2:00:48] different things, but what struck me is
[2:00:50] that when I'm correcting my kids, am I
[2:00:54] correcting them for their own benefit or
[2:00:58] I'm correcting them to save face?
[2:01:02] Maybe there's a visitor there. Maybe
[2:01:05] they do something I feel like, how will
[2:01:08] you do this in church now? This is going
[2:01:10] to bring disgrace on me and the family
[2:01:12] and stuff. and we're correcting them for
[2:01:15] our own pleasure.
[2:01:19] But look at how God corrects us.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; He corrects us for our profit.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; So correction has to be it has to be
[2:01:31] focused on the profit of the child. What
[2:01:34] will this child gain from correction?
[2:01:37] Let me
[2:01:39] times we react.
[2:01:42] Let me hold back my reaction and think
[2:01:46] this through.
[2:01:50] Back in the day when I was growing up, I
[2:01:52] had friends in school that would tell me
[2:01:53] that anytime they did something wrong
[2:01:55] during the day, they don't they don't
[2:01:58] get spanked for it during the day. It's
[2:02:01] at the middle of the night when they are
[2:02:02] sleeping.
[2:02:04] That's when they
[2:02:09] the parents will have conversation. I'm
[2:02:10] not saying that that's the right thing
[2:02:11] to do, but what I'm saying is
[2:02:14] that father had time to think through
[2:02:17] it.
[2:02:20] At the time they are correcting, they're
[2:02:22] not correcting from a reactive
[2:02:26] place. They're correcting from a place
[2:02:30] where they know this is going to profit
[2:02:31] the child.
[2:02:34] Many times what happens with kids that
[2:02:36] are molested is it's reactive. You do
[2:02:40] something wrong and a parent throws
[2:02:41] something and then the kid gets um you
[2:02:45] know um hurt somewhere. But if we take
[2:02:48] time to think about it, we will correct
[2:02:52] but we will explain why we are
[2:02:54] correcting.
[2:02:57] My dad did that a lot with us where when
[2:03:00] you want to get spanked you will have a
[2:03:03] conversation.
[2:03:05] Then he got to a time he stopped
[2:03:07] spanking us. And when he's having the
[2:03:09] conversation, you will prefer the
[2:03:11] spanking
[2:03:14] because he will point out every wrong
[2:03:17] thing that you did and why you shouldn't
[2:03:19] have done it and why you should have
[2:03:20] known better. You're like just spank me
[2:03:23] and let me go. You get the spanking, you
[2:03:26] go. But that is the right way. And I
[2:03:29] believe the bra talked about this as
[2:03:31] well. how we must make sure that when we
[2:03:35] are Is he almost 12?
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; All right. I have to I have to rush. Um
[2:03:45] I'm sorry. I wasn't looking at the time.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; I hope no one was looking at the time as
[2:03:50] well.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, I I'll be done. I'll be done.
[2:03:54] Just maybe give me five minutes over.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; They were listening.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know that I don't take time
[2:04:00] normally, right? You know my sermons are
[2:04:02] short, right? So please forgive me for
[2:04:04] today. But I'll just hit a few points
[2:04:06] and then we'll be done.
[2:04:09] So God expects us
[2:04:12] to chasten our children not for our
[2:04:16] pleasure but for their profit.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Now as our children grow older, the
[2:04:25] approach has got to change.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; You cannot treat an 18year-old
[2:04:31] the same way you will treat a
[2:04:32] 5-year-old.
[2:04:35] There are times where if your approach
[2:04:37] is spanking, the kids have to outgrow
[2:04:39] spanking. Otherwise, you are just
[2:04:42] fighting with your child.
[2:04:45] I don't think brother Peter would want
[2:04:47] to spank Daniel
[2:04:51] because that would be too fighting.
[2:04:56] But there's a different approach. And
[2:04:58] you know Isaiah was telling us he said
[2:05:00] whom shall he teach knowledge and whom
[2:05:01] shall he make to understand doctrine
[2:05:03] them that are weaned from the milk and
[2:05:06] drawn from the breast. So he told it he
[2:05:07] tells us that there's a progression even
[2:05:09] in our spiritual growth.
[2:05:12] And uh brother Bram had an experience
[2:05:14] that he narrated to us in questions and
[2:05:16] answers. I'll just paraphrase. I don't
[2:05:18] have time to read all of it. But this
[2:05:21] had to do with his daughter called
[2:05:22] Rebecca.
[2:05:24] Sister Rebecca
[2:05:26] at you know she had turned 18. Brother
[2:05:29] Bram called
[2:05:31] it when she got to a little teen Annie
[2:05:35] said she was going with some girl when
[2:05:37] we first went out there run over some
[2:05:40] girls house taking music lessons and she
[2:05:42] was going to come home and play certain
[2:05:44] type of music that brother Ram said
[2:05:46] wasn't welcome in their home and sister
[2:05:48] Mida had reacted in a different way.
[2:05:53] Sister Mida had reacted in a way that
[2:05:56] was more confrontational
[2:05:59] in the same way she would have treated
[2:06:00] her maybe when she was 10 years old or
[2:06:02] 12 years old but now she had gone to a
[2:06:06] different stage where the approach had
[2:06:09] to change.
[2:06:11] So brother Bram said here he said I said
[2:06:16] um so let me just read what brother so
[2:06:18] brother Bram actually went and um you
[2:06:20] know met with his wife and said um this
[2:06:24] approach is not right because
[2:06:28] sister Rebecca was getting very
[2:06:30] frustrated. She was going to leave the
[2:06:32] house. She was going to go she's going
[2:06:34] to go somewhere. They said she should
[2:06:35] not go and she was going to go anyways.
[2:06:37] Um so brother Ram called her.
[2:06:40] Brother Ram said, um,
[2:06:43] I never said that.
[2:06:45] I never said that. He was talking to his
[2:06:47] wife. We'll quit scolding her. Just
[2:06:50] advise her. She needs a body.
[2:06:55] And you are the one to be our body. You
[2:06:59] and I.
[2:07:01] We. must be friends with our kids to the
[2:07:04] point that our kids would rather trust
[2:07:06] us to take advice from us than from
[2:07:09] someone else.
[2:07:12] We must build that, especially as
[2:07:14] they're growing older, we must get to
[2:07:16] the point where we build that
[2:07:17] relationship with them that they rather
[2:07:20] say, "Let me let me have a conversation
[2:07:22] with dad and mom first before they take
[2:07:25] the um advice they get from their
[2:07:27] friends." I was telling our kids
[2:07:29] recently, we're reading um or talking
[2:07:31] about Raobam and how Rubam, you know,
[2:07:34] rather than take the advice of the wise
[2:07:36] men that were with his father Solomon,
[2:07:39] he took the advice of his friends, their
[2:07:41] age group. And I said, why was that
[2:07:43] wrong? And the simple answer is the wise
[2:07:46] men knew a lot more than the age group
[2:07:49] of Rhob
[2:07:52] said, this kids today needs a body. If
[2:07:55] they had a mother and father will stay
[2:07:57] home and take care of them instead of
[2:07:59] out here in the barroom running around
[2:08:01] all night and things like that wouldn't
[2:08:04] have a juvenile delinquency. They get
[2:08:07] away from the Bible. They all went to
[2:08:09] church and made bunko games and things
[2:08:11] like that. Said you're trying to polish
[2:08:13] up like Satan's ground out in
[2:08:16] Hollywoods. You could never bring
[2:08:18] Hollywood into the church. I mean bring
[2:08:19] the church into Hollywood. You've got to
[2:08:21] bring Hollywood to your grounds,
[2:08:24] not on their grounds. Let them come over
[2:08:28] here. We got something they know nothing
[2:08:31] about. So, we got down our knees and
[2:08:34] committed it to God. I said, "I know
[2:08:36] she's 18 years old. We'll be in a few
[2:08:38] days. A girl that age will think about
[2:08:42] boyfriends."
[2:08:44] I told the other ones of my kid, I said
[2:08:46] there's Don't tell me there's no boy
[2:08:48] that you think is good-look or there's
[2:08:52] no girl that doesn't. No, because at
[2:08:54] their age, I could tell.
[2:08:56] I I had a crush when I was in elementary
[2:08:59] school and I'm not holding it back
[2:09:06] because if my 8-year-old sees a girl and
[2:09:10] thinks she's pretty and she's afraid and
[2:09:11] he's afraid to tell me, I want him to
[2:09:13] know that I went through that as well
[2:09:15] because it's developmental stages. The
[2:09:19] the mistake our parents made was they
[2:09:21] all grew up fine.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; They had no sin. They all made A's in
[2:09:27] their grade. Everybody was fine. My dad
[2:09:30] was quite honest. I would tell us what
[2:09:32] he went through. But maybe I'll say that
[2:09:34] we probably need to start a little
[2:09:36] earlier
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; because of the things they're
[2:09:38] encountering in school. So, Brother Bram
[2:09:40] said here, he said she will think about
[2:09:44] boyfriends. We've kept her in. I never
[2:09:47] wanted to see her get married. I want to
[2:09:50] put her in the office here, do the work.
[2:09:52] I want to see her filled with the spirit
[2:09:55] and leave like that. That's how every
[2:09:56] father is. You never really want your
[2:09:58] daughter to go, right? He said, "Well,
[2:10:00] we all wanted that." Well, we can't do
[2:10:03] that. She just won't listen to it. I
[2:10:05] said, "Wait a minute. We've raised her
[2:10:07] all we can.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Do all you can on that day. God will
[2:10:13] say, "Yes, you did what you can.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; It's not in our hands to save our kids."
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; It's not in our hands. We are never
[2:10:21] going to be able to do it. But if we do
[2:10:23] our part and leave the rest to God, then
[2:10:26] God will do it.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; It might be their last minute on earth
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; that God will turn them back.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; God could do it a few years before. God
[2:10:35] could do it many years before. God could
[2:10:38] take a child that has gone into all the
[2:10:40] nonsense of this world and make him a
[2:10:42] preacher tomorrow. You never really
[2:10:44] know.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; But we've got to do our part. So brother
[2:10:47] was saying, we've raised her all we can.
[2:10:49] Now put her in the hands of God. Commit
[2:10:52] her. Then when she does anything, say
[2:10:55] Becky, darling, he was advising his
[2:10:57] wife. Mother don't want you to do that,
[2:11:00] but I'm your pal.
[2:11:02] I'll stick by you.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; Let her know you love her. She's going
[2:11:07] to get somebody to love her, and it
[2:11:10] might be the wrong woman.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Remember, Brother Aram said that we are
[2:11:14] built as humans to crave for fellowship.
[2:11:18] We also crave for love because that's
[2:11:19] what fellowship brings. But we want to
[2:11:21] be the ones that our kids would rather
[2:11:24] take love and fellowship from rather
[2:11:26] than someone out there because they
[2:11:28] could guide them in the wrong path. You
[2:11:30] be the woman does the loving. Honey,
[2:11:34] that sound kind of cruel crude, but
[2:11:37] people come everywhere. Brother was now
[2:11:39] telling her that yes, I'm your husband,
[2:11:42] but I'm more than just that. People come
[2:11:45] everywhere and set on personal
[2:11:47] interviews and things. I said, I'm so
[2:11:50] common. We're common to one another
[2:11:52] because we are husband and wife, but we
[2:11:55] never let that happen. You must remember
[2:12:00] this is the name of the Lord. In other
[2:12:04] words, I'm not telling you this as your
[2:12:06] husband.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you this as a servant of the
[2:12:10] Lord. Amen.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; And if brother Bram was not just
[2:12:13] advising Sister Ma as the husband, but
[2:12:16] as a servant of the Lord, then I want to
[2:12:18] take what brother Bram said and apply it
[2:12:21] as well
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; because that is the mind of God.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; I want to make sure I'm friends
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; with my teenagers
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; to the point where they would rather
[2:12:30] take my advice than take someone else's
[2:12:32] advice.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Can I make it happen myself? No. But can
[2:12:37] I do all I can to make it happen?
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. Abraham said, "We got down,
[2:12:41] committed it to God, said we'll take our
[2:12:43] hands off it." That afternoon, she
[2:12:46] coming. She said, "Well, I guess you'll
[2:12:48] still staying.
[2:12:50] Um, I guess I guess you're still
[2:12:52] staying. I ain't got going over there."
[2:12:54] So, she said she's not going where she
[2:12:56] was going before. So, what was actually
[2:12:58] making them argue? She and her mother.
[2:13:01] The prayer worked.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; The prayer worked.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Sometimes all we need to do is pray
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; and God will work on the other side.
[2:13:08] said, "No, I'll never said nothing about
[2:13:11] it." Said, "You know, mother don't want
[2:13:14] you know mother don't want you to do
[2:13:16] that and you know that it's like to kill
[2:13:19] your daddy when he heard you up there
[2:13:22] playing that boogie woogie music ever
[2:13:24] what it was with that girl said." Now,
[2:13:27] he didn't want you to do that and we
[2:13:29] don't want you to do that, Becky, but we
[2:13:33] just committed it to the Lord. I want
[2:13:35] you to know we love you. Whatever you
[2:13:38] do, we still love you.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; The last thing that God does, hold on,
[2:13:44] there are two more things. God shows
[2:13:46] compassion and mercy.
[2:13:48] Um, I'll just run through this very
[2:13:50] quickly.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Bring it on.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; Um, Psalms 103, like a father pier his
[2:13:57] children, so the Lord piered them fear
[2:13:58] him. As one who is mother comforted in
[2:14:01] Isaiah tells us, so will I comfort you.
[2:14:04] And he says, thou, oh Lord, are our
[2:14:06] father. Thy name is from everlasting.
[2:14:08] Now brother Ram told a story. Um many of
[2:14:11] us should be familiar with this. Their
[2:14:13] son Joseph, brother Joseph Branham, who
[2:14:16] is now a grandpa I'm sure um he did
[2:14:21] something wrong in the house and sister
[2:14:25] media was going to give him a spanking
[2:14:27] and he ran to the father and as soon as
[2:14:29] the bra carried him he said daddy I'm
[2:14:32] sorry.
[2:14:35] When he said, "Daddy, I'm sorry." Sister
[2:14:37] Mida said, "Billy, give him a spank."
[2:14:41] And Brother Bram could not do it
[2:14:45] because he felt this child already
[2:14:48] repented.
[2:14:50] Now,
[2:14:53] Sister Mida didn't like that,
[2:14:57] and we know what that resulted into
[2:14:59] because she was um she was rude to God's
[2:15:03] servant. and God did not like it. What
[2:15:05] God told Brother to tell her to go and
[2:15:07] read about um Moses and his sister and
[2:15:11] his brother. Um but brother Bram told
[2:15:13] Joseph, he said, "Joseph, come on. Daddy
[2:15:17] shall give you a licking. You know that.
[2:15:20] But being that you repented,
[2:15:23] remember my patience is going to run out
[2:15:25] one of those days."
[2:15:28] And that repenting, you've got to bring
[2:15:30] forth fruit meets for repentance. and
[2:15:33] prove to me that you really mean it.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; So God shows us compassion, but we must
[2:15:39] show the same level of compassion to our
[2:15:41] children
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; to be able to win them over. I'm not
[2:15:45] saying we should be so soft and let them
[2:15:47] to be wherever they want to be, but also
[2:15:49] we shouldn't be too hard on them to the
[2:15:52] point as we read, you know, Paul saying
[2:15:55] we should not provoke them.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; But Ram said somewhere, he said that we
[2:16:01] need to be careful. They've got their
[2:16:02] guardian angels. You should be careful
[2:16:05] not to provoke their guardian angel.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; The last thing that God does, God
[2:16:10] reinforces our identity and our
[2:16:14] relationship with him.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; And we've got to do the same for our
[2:16:18] kids.
[2:16:20] None of our kids are bad kids. That's
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; None of them are renegades. That's why
[2:16:25] brother Rama said he didn't like the
[2:16:27] Lord told him to stop calling those kids
[2:16:29] Rickys and Rickers.
[2:16:31] right
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; kids in the world. So we should never
[2:16:34] allow the bad words like that to come
[2:16:37] out of our mouth.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; God was telling Israel, "Is he not thy
[2:16:40] father that he that had brought thee?"
[2:16:43] Jeremiah said, "Thou shalt call me my
[2:16:45] father and shall not turn away from me."
[2:16:49] John 1:2 said to give them the power to
[2:16:52] become sons of God. Galatians said, "The
[2:16:54] spirit of his son is in your hearts
[2:16:56] crying aba father." God is reinforcing
[2:16:59] that we are his children and he's our
[2:17:01] father. I will be a father unto you and
[2:17:04] ye shall be my sons and daughters.
[2:17:06] Second Corinthians.
[2:17:09] Now, brother Aram said this. I'll just
[2:17:11] quickly say the story. I'm so sorry I'm
[2:17:13] way past time. My dad told us something
[2:17:16] when we were growing up. Brother um my
[2:17:18] dad said that he was a boy as a boy.
[2:17:22] Like he was very stubborn as a little
[2:17:25] boy. And many times he thought his
[2:17:28] father never loved him. But one day he
[2:17:31] went out with his father. My dad my
[2:17:32] grandfather was um you know an
[2:17:35] educationist. He he was well to do. So
[2:17:39] my grandfather took my dad out and went
[2:17:43] to visit with some of his friends like
[2:17:45] prestigious people.
[2:17:47] And my grandfather introduced my father
[2:17:51] to his friends as his son said this is
[2:17:54] my boy. And that moment my father said,
[2:17:57] "So this man thinks highly of me enough
[2:18:01] to introduce me to his friends. I must
[2:18:04] change."
[2:18:05] What was happening? He was reinforcing
[2:18:08] his identity.
[2:18:11] By reinforcing our children's identity.
[2:18:13] What are we here for? Why do we come to
[2:18:15] church? To know who we are.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; God wants us to know who we are. Once we
[2:18:20] know who we are, then the rapture is
[2:18:21] going to go.
[2:18:23] So our children, we must let them know
[2:18:26] who they are. Even if they are acting
[2:18:29] differently,
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; they must know that's not who you are.
[2:18:33] We must reinforce their identity. We
[2:18:35] must reinforce our relationship with
[2:18:37] them. We must let them know regardless
[2:18:39] of what you do, I'm never going to
[2:18:40] disown you.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; You're my child. You will remain my
[2:18:44] child.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Brother says this in thy house. He said,
[2:18:46] "Now, reason I thought about saying this
[2:18:49] because you people here, most of your
[2:18:50] children are saved. They're Christians.
[2:18:53] I've admired Brother Ian's family. This
[2:18:55] young man here usually maybe I'll ask
[2:18:58] the musicians to come so you know I'm
[2:19:00] closing. Musicians, you can come. I'm so
[2:19:02] sorry." Brother Ram said, "I've admired
[2:19:05] Brother A's family. This young man here
[2:19:07] usually who would get a teenager sit
[2:19:10] around and listen to someone preacher
[2:19:12] talk." Said, "Usually who will get that?
[2:19:14] That doesn't happen often." is saying
[2:19:16] why they be out and gone somewhere
[2:19:18] little girls like that I said to brother
[2:19:21] Fred his kids they can just hear me say
[2:19:24] one thing that's wrong they're ready to
[2:19:27] stop it right now you see and set with
[2:19:30] the highest respect
[2:19:32] so brother Abraham is preaching those
[2:19:35] kids know the word enough to come ask
[2:19:38] questions
[2:19:42] but they don't do it arrogantly
[2:19:44] they Come with respect instead of being
[2:19:47] out a hot roing rambling around a hot
[2:19:52] roing rambling around they when they
[2:19:54] hear you speak about the gospel they're
[2:19:56] ready to sit right there and listen he
[2:19:59] said now I know we all want our kids
[2:20:05] we all think our kids is renegades and
[2:20:07] things like that but we must stop that I
[2:20:11] believe we must remember that these kids
[2:20:13] are the best kids in the world
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; because they are our children
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; and we claim them for God.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Now your salvation will not save that
[2:20:27] child. But Paul said believe on the Lord
[2:20:29] Jesus Christ and thy and thy house shall
[2:20:32] be saved.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; What did he mean by that? It didn't mean
[2:20:35] that because they were saved that their
[2:20:36] house would be saved with it. He meant
[2:20:38] this that because if they had enough
[2:20:41] faith
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; to be saved themselves, that same amount
[2:20:45] of faith that he had for himself will
[2:20:48] work for his children.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; Now I've got my children. There's my
[2:20:51] little son, Joseph, Billy, Sarah,
[2:20:53] Rebecca. I want to see each of them a
[2:20:56] worker in the gospel doing something. I
[2:21:00] want to see them saved and filled with
[2:21:02] the Holy Ghost.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; Now, I've committed them to God. I'm
[2:21:06] holding on to God for them. See, and I
[2:21:09] believe they are going to be saved. We
[2:21:12] must believe that our children are going
[2:21:14] to be saved. Brother Aram said, "Every
[2:21:17] one of them."
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; And I believe that that is a truth.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; I don't know how many of you know, but I
[2:21:23] don't think Sister Sarah Bram was going
[2:21:24] to church at some point. I mean, we
[2:21:26] don't hear about her, but Brother Bram
[2:21:28] claimed that for God. I don't want to
[2:21:30] know who she got married to, where she
[2:21:31] is. Brother Bram claimed that for God,
[2:21:33] and I know that she will be in the
[2:21:35] rapture. Amen.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Every one of them,
[2:21:38] see, I believe they're going to be saved
[2:21:39] and I'll have them on the other side. I
[2:21:43] don't believe my salvation will save
[2:21:44] them. No, but my faith in God will do
[2:21:47] it." You see, my faith, believing God
[2:21:50] will do it, will cause them to come to
[2:21:53] Christ.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; And I believe that's where you people
[2:21:56] praying for your children. And that's
[2:21:58] the reason your children has the
[2:22:00] manners. And the real lady and gentlemen
[2:22:03] in this wild age that we are living in
[2:22:05] yet they have that part about them
[2:22:08] that's the best I know of any kids.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; I think the reason of that is because
[2:22:14] your prayers for them. You've committed
[2:22:17] them to God and you are holding on.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; Let's be on our feet. I'll read one more
[2:22:23] quote.
[2:22:26] It's a collective work.
[2:22:28] Fathers, mothers, children.
[2:22:33] Before God, we are all children.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; He's our father.
[2:22:38] And children, your parents father must
[2:22:42] become your father. I don't mean your
[2:22:44] grandfather. I mean your parents
[2:22:47] heavenly father has got to become your
[2:22:50] heavenly father. But Ram said, "And let
[2:22:53] one member of the family get nervous.
[2:22:56] It goes to the next member and the next
[2:22:59] member and the first thing you're all
[2:23:02] forcing and going on and one member of
[2:23:05] the family gets kind of upset about
[2:23:06] something. He upsets the other and the
[2:23:08] other and the other and the first thing
[2:23:10] you know the whole family is upset. He
[2:23:13] said it's Satan.
[2:23:16] We've got to run Satan out of our homes.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; We've got to discern what is happening
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; when Satan shows up in the home. said
[2:23:26] then if one member of the family
[2:23:29] rejoices
[2:23:31] let the rest of them rejoice with it. So
[2:23:34] everyone of the family try to do that.
[2:23:38] Try each one of you children to help
[2:23:41] your papa. Mama mama papa you try to
[2:23:46] help the children.
[2:23:48] Don't let that gloomy unbelieving spirit
[2:23:52] get around you.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Why? You're Christians.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; You are born of the spirit of God. You
[2:23:58] are the salt of the earth. You have
[2:24:00] God-given rights. And the Bible said,
[2:24:03] "If there be any praise, if there be any
[2:24:06] virtue,
[2:24:08] think on those things.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; Don't think about the wrong thing."
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you all in the name
[2:24:15] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:24:23] Let's just bow our heads for a word of
[2:24:25] prayer.
[2:24:27] Loving father,
[2:24:30] I believe this has been done according
[2:24:32] to your command.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; So unworthy to say the words, but Paul
[2:24:36] said,
[2:24:38] I have received of the Lord that which
[2:24:40] also I give unto you.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; You gave our prophet this words.
[2:24:47] You've made the Bible a new book unto
[2:24:49] us. We don't just read the Bible
[2:24:52] theologically.
[2:24:54] We read it with understanding.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; We read it with revelation.
[2:24:59] knowing who we ought to be in every
[2:25:01] aspect of our lives. knowing that you
[2:25:04] want to form your character in us and
[2:25:07] bring us to a place dear Lord Jesus
[2:25:10] where we will do everything we'll do
[2:25:14] by own your own leadership
[2:25:17] where our children will look at us
[2:25:20] and Lord may it never be but even if
[2:25:23] they don't agree with what we believe
[2:25:26] they will be able to say I know my
[2:25:28] parents are true Christians
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; help every parent hereord Lord Jesus, as
[2:25:35] your prophet said, we've got to apply
[2:25:37] the same faith that we had for our own
[2:25:40] salvation, apply that same faith for our
[2:25:42] kids.
[2:25:44] And know that regardless of what
[2:25:45] happens,
[2:25:47] you will save them. They will be with us
[2:25:50] in the rapture,
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. They will be with us, Lord,
[2:25:55] in the translation,
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, on the other side. Lord, the
[2:25:59] family chain will not be broken.
[2:26:02] Father, that is our confession. That is
[2:26:05] what we believe.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, if any of our kids are going
[2:26:09] weward, Lord, we will not call them
[2:26:12] that.
[2:26:14] We will remind them of their true
[2:26:15] identity.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; We will tell them they are the best
[2:26:18] children in the world.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; We'll let them know, Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:26:22] Father, that they were
[2:26:25] brought forward and dedicated as babies.
[2:26:29] And that prayer that was offered
[2:26:31] whenever it was you heard that prayer
[2:26:35] and you are going to bring it to pass.
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; Lord help us. Give us guidance. These
[2:26:40] are your children that you have given
[2:26:42] unto us. We cannot take care of them
[2:26:44] ourselves.
[2:26:47] You've only put them in
[2:26:49] our care. They are your children.
[2:26:53] Help us to know that we have the work to
[2:26:56] do.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, on the other side,
[2:27:00] they won't be children to us. We'll be
[2:27:03] brothers and sisters.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; Help us to have that consciousness as
[2:27:08] well.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; That Lord, in all the callings of our
[2:27:11] lives,
[2:27:12] including this one on that day, you'll
[2:27:15] be able to say, "Welcome,
[2:27:18] faithful servant.
[2:27:21] You've done what your Lord asked you to
[2:27:22] do." Pray you bless us as we go. We pray
[2:27:25] you bless our pastor Lord and Benjamin
[2:27:28] Lord on their hunting trip. May you give
[2:27:31] them good game. May you also Lord Jesus
[2:27:34] have let them have a wonderful time of
[2:27:36] fellowship. Lord our pastor desires to
[2:27:39] Lord one way or the other just be of a
[2:27:42] good influence to his brother. Lord
[2:27:44] maybe Lord in a way he can Lord just see
[2:27:47] the life of Christ Lord that would make
[2:27:50] him to also want to be Lord like our
[2:27:52] pastor. We pray that you just bring that
[2:27:55] testimony, Lord Jesus Christ. Father,
[2:27:57] back with him. Bless us today, Lord
[2:28:00] Jesus. If I've said anything that I
[2:28:01] ought not to say, I pray that you will
[2:28:03] forgive me. I trust, Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:28:06] that this is what you wanted to give to
[2:28:08] your people. And Lord, beyond us
[2:28:11] hearing, Lord Jesus, give us the ability
[2:28:13] to do the word that we heard this
[2:28:15] morning. We give you all the glory,
[2:28:17] honor, and praise. In Jesus Christ's
[2:28:20] name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[2:28:25] Brothers, can you please just I know we
[2:28:27] don't know the song. We might not sing
[2:28:28] it, but if you can just bring up the
[2:28:30] lyrics of that song that brother Pharaoh
[2:28:31] sang, I just want to read it out to us.
[2:28:36] It says, "Oh, father of the fatherless
[2:28:38] in whom all families are blessed. I love
[2:28:41] the way you father me." This is how he
[2:28:44] fathers us. You gave me life. You
[2:28:46] forgave the past.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; God, help us to forgive our children.
[2:28:52] Now in your arms I'm safe at last. I
[2:28:55] love the way you father me. When bruised
[2:28:59] and broken, I draw near. You hold me
[2:29:02] close and dry my tears. I love the way
[2:29:06] you father me. At last my fearful heart
[2:29:09] is still surrender to your perfect will.
[2:29:13] I love the way you father me. said, "If
[2:29:16] in my foolishness I stray,
[2:29:19] returning empty and ashamed,
[2:29:23] I love the way you father me, exchanging
[2:29:26] for my wretchedness,
[2:29:28] your radiant robes of righteousness.
[2:29:32] I love the way you father me." And when
[2:29:36] I look into your eyes, from deep within,
[2:29:38] my spirit cries, I love the way you
[2:29:41] father me. Before such love I stand
[2:29:45] amazed
[2:29:46] and ever will through endless days. I
[2:29:51] love the way you father me. Father me
[2:29:54] forever. Father me and in your embrace
[2:29:57] I'll be forever secure.
[2:30:00] I love the way you father me.
[2:30:04] [Music]
[2:30:09] I'm a child of the king.
[2:30:12] Oh yes.
[2:30:15] Oh yes.
[2:30:18] I'm a child
[2:30:20] of his royal blood.
[2:30:24] His royal
[2:30:26] blood. Oh, now flows through
[2:30:32] my veins.
[2:30:34] And I
[2:30:37] who was wretched
[2:30:40] and po
[2:30:42] now can see.
[2:30:45] Praise God.
[2:30:48] Praise God.
[2:30:51] I'm a child of
[2:30:54] Let's sing him one more time as brother
[2:30:56] Emanuel comes. Oh yes, they might. Oh
[2:31:00] yes,
[2:31:02] I am a child
[2:31:05] of the king.
[2:31:08] Oh yes.
[2:31:19] And I
[2:31:21] know
[2:31:24] that
[2:31:27] I can sing.
[2:31:30] Praise God.
[2:31:33] Praise God.
[2:31:35] I'm a child of the king.
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Toby said he felt this was
[2:31:47] inspired of the Lord.
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; And I believe that too.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; My brother, thank you very much. This
[2:31:57] was very bold and this was very
[2:31:59] practical. I believe we all have
[2:32:01] something that we are going to use when
[2:32:03] we get home.
[2:32:06] How many are going to be praying for
[2:32:08] brother Toby?
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, that is easy. Now, how many are
[2:32:11] going to be praying for me and the
[2:32:13] parents?
[2:32:15] Hallelujah. Now, children, this is
[2:32:17] something you have to know. It's not
[2:32:20] always fathers and mothers praying for
[2:32:22] you. Sometimes the Lord can reveal
[2:32:25] something to your heart and you also
[2:32:27] have to pray for your parents. And the
[2:32:29] Lord listens because he knows it's
[2:32:31] needed in the house. Hallelujah.
[2:32:35] You know any of us can quote scriptures,
[2:32:39] memory verses, quotes.
[2:32:43] But as he was talking, I was thinking
[2:32:45] how many of that
[2:32:47] in my own life is the lived voice
[2:32:51] and that is what is important and that
[2:32:53] is what matters before God.
[2:32:56] And that's why you have to realize young
[2:32:58] girl when you step out there when you
[2:33:01] could have those earrings and you don't
[2:33:03] have them. That is a lived voice. When
[2:33:06] you could put on that tight pants so
[2:33:09] that you get all the attention of the
[2:33:10] men and you choose to wear those big
[2:33:13] skirts, that is a lived voice.
[2:33:16] Understanding that we are called into
[2:33:18] it. It's a life.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; May God help us all.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; I believe we all needed it.
[2:33:25] Let's bow our hearts before him.
[2:33:28] Our dear Lord and King, our God and
[2:33:30] Master, our Savior, you mean everything
[2:33:32] to us. Thank you again for imparting
[2:33:36] into us our natural life. But more than
[2:33:38] that, thank you for imparting into us
[2:33:40] the spiritual life, Lord. And Father,
[2:33:42] calling us to emulate your life. Help
[2:33:45] us, oh God, as parents to be able to
[2:33:49] impart that life. Oh Lord, we invite
[2:33:52] your presence into our homes, into our
[2:33:54] minds, into our lives, into every aspect
[2:33:57] of our life, Father, that it will
[2:33:59] portray you, that it will manifest you
[2:34:02] in flesh again once more on this earth,
[2:34:04] oh Lord, because Father, we know that
[2:34:06] you that last representation will be
[2:34:09] made before the rapture. And here we are
[2:34:11] as your children. We have know our
[2:34:13] identity. We know we are the ones called
[2:34:15] to do that, Father. But Father,
[2:34:18] we have weaknesses. we are short force
[2:34:20] and that is why we turn to you again
