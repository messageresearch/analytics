[26:41] be gathered in your name. Lord, the name
[26:44] above all names, the name in which the
[26:47] family in heaven and on earth is called.
[26:51] The name that when we call upon the
[26:54] demons they tremble. Lord Jesus Christ.
[26:56] We thank you Lord to be identified with
[27:00] you Lord with that name. Lord Jesus
[27:03] Christ. Your children have come in this

[27:22] minds can be transformed, Lord, and be

[27:41] when people see us come to church
[27:44] proclaiming Christ, Lord, they expect uh
[27:47] they expect to see those characteristics
[27:49] of Christ. And Lord Jesus Christ, we
[27:51] know that we cannot do that by our own,
[27:54] but by your power, Lord Jesus Christ.
[27:57] And by coming to hear the words of
[27:59] eternal life. We pray Lord Jesus Christ
[28:01] that you may give us understanding and
[28:03] revelation of your word Lord Jesus
[28:06] Christ. Lord, we love you. We bless your
[28:08] holy name Lord Jesus Christ. If there be
[28:10] anyone Lord in our midst Lord not

[28:26] or three are gathered in your name

[43:51] mercies is always upon me.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; It pays to serve Jesus. I speak from my

[45:20] And off and I'm tempted. I will turn
[45:23] from the track. I think of my savior. My
[45:29] man wonders back to the place where
[45:33] there now him on Calary Street. I hear a
[45:39] voice saying I suffered for thee.

[47:13] give. I'm satisfied
[47:16] fully for Jesus to live. No friends may
[47:22] forsake me and friends and trials arise.
[47:27] I'm trusting in Jesus. His love never
[47:32] does.
[47:35] I love him forever. And in days of you I
[47:41] serve him more truly than ever before.

[48:08] His love and his kindness can never fade
[48:13] away.
[48:14] In winter, in summer, in sunshine and
[48:19] rain. His love and affection are always
[48:25] the same.
[48:28] I love him better than in days of you. I

[49:18] thee.
[49:19] [Music]
[49:22] I love him far better than in days of
[49:28] I serve him much truly than ever before.
[49:33] I do as he be was ever the cost. I'll be
[49:41] a true soldier
[49:44] and I at my post.
[49:48] God bless you church. Please don't mind
[49:50] me.
[49:51] [Applause]
[50:01] Mario, if I could ask you to come up
[50:02] right away.
[50:08] [Music]
[50:15] [Music]
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:31] I I
[50:36] I'm going to sing this song today
[50:40] as it as it expresses
[50:44] the current situation
[50:47] that I am in.
[50:50] I will
[50:52] like a few weeks ago. I would say
[50:55] perhaps a month I would say.
[50:59] I was driving when I received a call
[51:05] that
[51:06] my loving father passed away.
[51:11] I was driving and all of a sudden I
[51:14] stopped the vehicle
[51:17] and experienced
[51:19] the quietness
[51:22] of this news
[51:25] and I know
[51:27] I gave this testimony
[51:32] that
[51:36] I heard a voice says he was he will be
[51:38] dead at 96 years old.
[51:42] I am not here to preserve a lie that it
[51:44] that was told by the devil.
[51:48] And I know that the prophet say if it if
[51:50] it doesn't happen
[51:53] the way
[51:55] that you told that you've been told it
[51:57] would happen, it is not the voice of
[51:58] God.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; So uh amid all the tribulations,
[52:06] persecutions,
[52:08] hardships of life, there are many voices
[52:10] that talks
[52:12] But
[52:15] once we are in the body of Christ, we
[52:18] must be able to determine which is the
[52:21] voice of Christ.
[52:24] And then we will be able to know that
[52:27] voice
[52:28] if it if it happened exactly the way
[52:32] that God told us it will happen.
[52:35] Otherwise, it's not the voice of Christ.
[52:39] And then the prophet says
[52:45] if there is someone
[52:48] that is a problem that is me it's not
[52:53] Christ. Sometime we listen to many voice
[52:58] but it is our own voice that is the
[53:00] problem.
[53:02] So
[53:04] my apologies if I told that
[53:08] but I believe I'm speaking to people
[53:10] that are matured in the in the body of
[53:13] Christ. You will understand that.
[53:16] So does Jesus care?
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Yes he does.
[53:26] Does Gus
[53:29] care
[53:32] When my heart
[53:35] is pained
[53:38] too deeply
[53:40] for mirth
[53:42] and song.
[53:47] When the bird
[53:49] then press
[53:53] and the cares
[53:56] the distress
[54:00] and the way
[54:02] grow was weary
[54:05] and long.
[54:07] [Music]
[54:09] Oh yes,
[54:12] he cares.
[54:15] And I know

[54:31] When the days
[54:34] so weary
[54:38] the long
[54:40] night we

[55:05] less dread
[55:07] and fear.
[55:09] [Music]
[55:11] As the day
[55:14] lights fade
[55:16] [Music]
[55:17] into deep
[55:20] night shades,
[55:23] does he care
[55:25] enough
[55:27] to be paid?
[55:31] Oh yes,
[55:34] he cares.
[55:36] And I know
[55:38] he cares.
[55:40] His heart
[55:43] is touched with my grief.
[55:47] [Music]
[55:50] When the days
[55:52] so weary,
[55:55] the lone
[55:56] night dreary,
[55:59] and I know
[56:01] that my savior
[56:04] cares.
[56:07] Does Jesus
[56:09] care?
[56:11] &gt;&gt; When I've tried
[56:14] and failed
[56:16] to resist
[56:18] some temptation
[56:21] strong
[56:24] when my dear
[56:27] face is grief,
[56:29] there is no
[56:32] relief.
[56:34] Though my tears
[56:36] flows all the night long.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Oh yes,
[56:44] he cares.
[56:46] And I know
[56:48] he cares
[56:50] cuz he touched his heart. He's touched
[56:54] with my grief.
[56:57] [Music]
[56:59] Oh, when the days
[57:02] are weary,
[57:05] the long
[57:07] night we
[57:09] know that my savior
[57:13] he cares.
[57:17] Does Jesus
[57:19] care
[57:21] when I've said
[57:24] goodbye
[57:26] to one of the dearest
[57:30] to me
[57:34] in my s
[57:37] hearted
[57:40] till it's nearly
[57:43] breaks.
[57:45] Is it odd
[57:48] to him?
[57:50] Does he see?
[57:52] [Music]
[57:54] Oh yes,
[57:56] he cares.
[57:58] And I know
[58:01] he cares.
[58:03] His heart
[58:05] is touched with my grief.
[58:09] [Music]
[58:15] When the days
[58:19] so weary,
[58:22] the long
[58:24] night we
[58:28] know
[58:30] that my savior
[58:33] cares.
[58:35] [Music]
[58:37] [Applause]
[58:49] Amen. If you all please stand with me as
[58:52] we change the order of the service.
[59:01] [Music]
[59:02] Oh, we sing praises to your name.
[59:08] Oh

[1:02:04] [Music]
[1:02:06] Amen. God bless you this morning.
[1:02:08] Welcome to the house of the Lord once
[1:02:11] again. It's an honor and a privilege to
[1:02:13] gather together in his name, the name
[1:02:16] above every name.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Certainly thankful to be back. It's sure
[1:02:21] good to get away and have a break.
[1:02:24] Certainly thank everyone who helped make
[1:02:26] that possible. I know it can be a real
[1:02:28] inconvenience, but I believe something
[1:02:32] happened and we had a wonderful time.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Just have a few requests this morning
[1:02:39] that we'd like to bring
[1:02:41] before the throne. And before we do
[1:02:43] that, we actually have a praise report.
[1:02:45] It's from Brother Jose and Sister Becky.
[1:02:50] It's a praise report. We want to give
[1:02:52] all the glory to God for his
[1:02:54] faithfulness, traveling mercies granted
[1:02:56] to my mother Emily.
[1:02:59] The Lord went before her and made every
[1:03:01] path smooth and guiding her journey with
[1:03:04] peace and grace.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; They say we also thank the church for
[1:03:09] your prayers.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to give the Lord the
[1:03:12] glory.
[1:03:15] We have a request this morning from
[1:03:18] sister kindness
[1:03:20] says please saints pray with me for a
[1:03:24] situation in my home church back home
[1:03:27] and my understanding is that this
[1:03:30] happened about eight or nine hours ago.
[1:03:33] Please saints pray with me a situation
[1:03:35] in my home church back home that God
[1:03:38] will arrest the armed men who took some
[1:03:41] of our members while traveling and bring
[1:03:44] them back home safely.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; So some people were kidnapped and uh I
[1:03:50] asked how many and I think seven or
[1:03:52] eight people. They went to a funeral and
[1:03:55] were traveling back home. They were on
[1:03:56] their way back and armed men just
[1:03:59] kidnapped them.
[1:04:01] She says, "Praying that God will
[1:04:03] intervene
[1:04:05] at this time and they will be returned
[1:04:08] and released.
[1:04:10] I know he is much
[1:04:14] more than able." God bless you.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to stand with sister
[1:04:18] kindness this morning and remember those
[1:04:21] folks who are in great distress this
[1:04:24] morning, our time, probably evening
[1:04:26] their time. Another request from brother
[1:04:30] Emanuel Lobe says, "I'm asking for
[1:04:34] prayers for my mother, Sister Mary Loe,
[1:04:36] who has been suffering from a cough and
[1:04:39] chest pain for over a month. All the
[1:04:42] medical tests she has done have come
[1:04:44] back negative and the doctors no longer
[1:04:47] know what to do. I'm counting on divine
[1:04:50] intervention."
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; And you know, that's exactly the place
[1:04:55] where God specializes. Amen.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; We'd also like to remember brother Jerry
[1:05:00] Carpenter who's been having a bout of
[1:05:02] bleeding noses.
[1:05:04] If you just have a request this morning
[1:05:06] that you would like to remember, maybe
[1:05:07] make it known unto him by way of an
[1:05:09] uplift hand as we go to him with these
[1:05:12] requests.
[1:05:14] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank
[1:05:16] you for your goodness and your tender
[1:05:18] mercies once again, Father, for us to
[1:05:20] gather together, to have the privilege,
[1:05:22] Lord, to gather together in your name.
[1:05:25] Lord Jesus, we know that there is no
[1:05:27] other provided place of worship on this
[1:05:30] earth than in you. And Father, we
[1:05:34] recognize that and we thank you for
[1:05:36] that, Lord. That place that you carved
[1:05:38] out in this world of darkness, Lord. We
[1:05:40] know that you showed that it would be
[1:05:43] completely black if not for a little
[1:05:45] tiny sliver of light here in the end.
[1:05:49] And we know that light is you, Father.
[1:05:50] And we just make a a way for you,
[1:05:52] Father. All hail King Jesus this
[1:05:55] morning.
[1:06:00] Heavenly Father,
[1:06:02] we don't count it lightly to gather
[1:06:04] together this way. We don't know how
[1:06:05] many more times
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; we'll be able to.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; But while we can, Father, we give you
[1:06:11] praise.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; We give you glory and honor, Lord.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; We thank you for your goodness to us,
[1:06:17] Lord. We don't say it in vain, Lord. We
[1:06:20] know that you are the author and the
[1:06:22] finisher of our faith, Lord. Let alone
[1:06:24] all of the things that you provide for
[1:06:26] us in our lives.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, we just thank you for the needs in
[1:06:35] our lives.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; We just commit each need made known unto
[1:06:38] you today by the way of an uplift hand.
[1:06:40] Father, that you would sovereignly
[1:06:42] intervene in those needs.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; That you would meet the need, Lord
[1:06:47] Jesus, according to your will. We pray
[1:06:49] for brother Jerry Carpenter, Lord, that
[1:06:51] you would help them. Help him with the
[1:06:53] bleeding noses, Lord.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; You're a faithful light shining in the
[1:06:58] past. We pray that you would just bless
[1:07:00] them abundantly.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to remember, oh,
[1:07:05] Father, Brother Emanuel's mom.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; She needs a touch from you, Father. We
[1:07:10] stand together united as a body to give
[1:07:12] you praise.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just want to oh father
[1:07:19] remember the request made known unto you
[1:07:22] today unto us Lord by sister kindness
[1:07:24] father of those people who were
[1:07:26] kidnapped.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Lord we know that this world is not our
[1:07:30] home. We are just pilgrims passing
[1:07:32] through Father. And Lord Jesus, I I
[1:07:36] can't remember who it was or or where
[1:07:38] the testimony was, but we know that a
[1:07:40] very similar situation happened just
[1:07:43] exactly like this. And you came on the
[1:07:45] scene and you delivered those people who
[1:07:47] were held captives. And we know that's
[1:07:49] exactly according to your word. You said
[1:07:51] that yourself when you were on the mount
[1:07:55] preaching, Lord Jesus, that you would
[1:07:57] leave deliver the captives, Father, that
[1:08:00] you would set them free. So Lord Jesus,
[1:08:02] we stand united together in the name of
[1:08:04] Jesus and commit each life into your
[1:08:06] hands that you would deliver them in the
[1:08:08] name of Jesus.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; And Father, we pray for the captives,
[1:08:12] Lord, that maybe through this experience
[1:08:13] that they would be able to, Lord, maybe
[1:08:15] not just be arrested, but come to know
[1:08:17] you and the power of your resurrection,
[1:08:19] Lord, that they would recognize that
[1:08:21] these people that they've kidnapped are
[1:08:23] not ordinary people. These are different
[1:08:25] people. Amen.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, we know that Satan has no
[1:08:31] power, but what you allow him. And
[1:08:33] whatever you allow him is for our good.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Even if it doesn't look good from our
[1:08:38] natural senses, we know that something
[1:08:40] is happening. And Father, we just commit
[1:08:42] this need into your hand. And we'll be
[1:08:43] careful to bring you a praise report,
[1:08:45] Lord, when we hear it.
[1:08:48] Father, we just want to thank you for
[1:08:50] Lord your provision for Sister Michelle
[1:08:53] and brother Aiden's friends in the
[1:08:54] Netherlands. Lord,
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Father, we know that you are a God of
[1:08:58] miracles.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, if you would provide a home
[1:09:03] for people who can't afford it, who
[1:09:06] maybe outside of a miracle wouldn't be
[1:09:08] able to have it. Lord Jesus, how much
[1:09:10] more would you deliver the captives?
[1:09:12] Father,
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're so thankful that we know
[1:09:16] you. Amen.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Not just that we know of you, Father,
[1:09:19] but that we truly know you personally,
[1:09:21] Lord.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; And Father, you know my heart. My desire
[1:09:25] this morning is that if anybody doesn't
[1:09:27] know you this morning in the power of
[1:09:30] your resurrection, oh Father, that by
[1:09:32] the time we're done, that something will
[1:09:34] happen in their lives. Father, whether
[1:09:36] we're streaming or whether they watch
[1:09:38] this later or present right now in this
[1:09:41] building, Father, you're not bound by
[1:09:43] time or space. And we just give you the
[1:09:45] glory. We give you the liberty, Father.
[1:09:47] We welcome you with a kiss. Oh, Father,
[1:09:49] we anoint your head with oil.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; And what an honor to wash your feet,
[1:09:55] Lord.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; We love you and we thank you.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; We just want to commit these needs into
[1:10:02] your hands, Father, for your glory now.
[1:10:05] In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:09] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:10:13] Thank you, musicians.
[1:10:16] Just can it can't get in his presence
[1:10:18] and not get emotional.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Certainly wonderful.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles this morning, I
[1:10:24] have a scripture the Lord put on my
[1:10:26] heart.
[1:10:32] Just so thankful for the leadership of
[1:10:33] the Lord.
[1:10:36] Sorry. In Philippians chapter 3,
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Philippians chapter 3.
[1:10:46] Start reading with verse 9.
[1:11:01] Philippians 3:9.
[1:11:07] Just love this scripture, don't you?
[1:11:10] And being found in him. I believe we
[1:11:13] could just preach a a series on that
[1:11:16] right there. One sentence, being found
[1:11:19] in him,
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; and be found in him, not having mine own
[1:11:25] righteousness which is of the law, but
[1:11:28] that which is through the faith of
[1:11:30] Christ.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. by the righteousness
[1:11:34] which is of God by faith
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; that I may know him
[1:11:41] and the power of his resurrection
[1:11:46] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:11:50] being made conformable
[1:11:53] unto his death.
[1:11:55] If by any means I might attain unto the
[1:11:58] resurrection of the dead,
[1:12:01] not as though I had already attained,
[1:12:05] either were already per perfect,
[1:12:09] but I follow after if that I may
[1:12:12] apprehend
[1:12:14] that for which also I am apprehended of
[1:12:18] Christ Jesus.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brethren, I count not myself to
[1:12:23] have apprehended, but this one thing I
[1:12:26] do, forgetting those things which are
[1:12:28] behind, and reaching forth unto those
[1:12:31] things which are before. I press toward
[1:12:35] the mark for the prize of the high
[1:12:37] calling of God in Christ Jesus.
[1:12:42] Let us therefore
[1:12:44] as many as be perfect. And remember that
[1:12:49] word perfect is not something that we
[1:12:51] do. It's not us pressing our clothes or
[1:12:54] shining our wheels or keeping our house.
[1:12:57] It's not that. It's maturity. Amen.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; As many of us, let us therefore, as many
[1:13:04] as be perfect or mature,
[1:13:08] be thus minded. And if in anything ye be
[1:13:13] otherwise minded,
[1:13:15] God shall reveal even this unto you.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer one more time.
[1:13:23] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful for
[1:13:25] your word, Lord. We're so thankful for
[1:13:28] your leadership and your guidance, Lord
[1:13:29] Jesus. The provision that you've given
[1:13:32] us, Lord, in the day in which we live.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, the revealed word. It's one
[1:13:37] thing to to be able to know the word, to
[1:13:40] speak the word, and to read the word,
[1:13:42] but it's an entirely different thing to
[1:13:44] have it revealed to us.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Father, we just ask that one more time
[1:13:47] you would take this word that's spoken
[1:13:50] today and turn back the pages, Father,
[1:13:52] and reveal it to us. Help us to see what
[1:13:55] is written in between the lines. Lord
[1:13:57] Jesus, Father, we love you and we thank
[1:14:00] you. We just commit this word into your
[1:14:02] hands now for your glory. In Jesus
[1:14:04] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. You may be
[1:14:08] seated.
[1:14:13] Um, excuse me one second.
[1:14:26] Sorry about that. I just uh certainly
[1:14:29] excited to be here today. Glad to be
[1:14:32] back and uh we had just an absolutely
[1:14:35] wonderful time while we were away.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Uh just a few announcements before we
[1:14:41] get going. And uh I think it's it's just
[1:14:44] important to start out and uh have a
[1:14:49] little bit of a beginning to the
[1:14:51] service. You know, uh we've got a prayer
[1:14:54] meeting coming up on October the 9th at
[1:14:57] 7:30.
[1:14:58] If you can make it, it's always a
[1:15:00] wonderful time. We know the Lord has
[1:15:01] answered many prayers through those
[1:15:03] prayer meetings. We have the youth lunch
[1:15:06] and uh gathering will be at uh youth
[1:15:09] activity will be at our house on the
[1:15:11] 19th and uh we'll be hosting that. We
[1:15:15] have a communion service coming up at
[1:15:17] 5:30 on the 26th
[1:15:19] and we haven't had a communion service
[1:15:21] for quite some time. I'm certainly
[1:15:22] excited about that. And uh on the 31st
[1:15:26] we have a youth service here in the
[1:15:28] sanctuary. And uh for those people who
[1:15:31] are in the know, we had a youth service
[1:15:34] here on the 26th of September. And it
[1:15:36] was just a tremendous time of gathering.
[1:15:39] And uh you know, we had a little bit of
[1:15:41] an exhortation. I took it and explained
[1:15:44] the purpose behind it, what we really
[1:15:46] are after with it. And I know because
[1:15:48] it's something new and different, some
[1:15:50] people get nervous and think, "What are
[1:15:52] we doing? This is out of order. It's not
[1:15:53] what we normally do." You know what?
[1:15:55] It's it's it's good to get a little bit
[1:15:57] out of order once in a while. I'm not
[1:15:59] saying that it's out of order, but it's
[1:16:01] different. It's something new and I say
[1:16:03] exciting. And you know why I say that is
[1:16:05] I've heard from multiple of the youth
[1:16:08] they're asking for more. Not just once a
[1:16:11] month, but twice a month. And I said,
[1:16:14] "That's that's great. I love the
[1:16:17] enthusiasm with it, but what I would
[1:16:19] like to do is just walk before we run.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Let's see if we can start doing some
[1:16:23] regular monthly meetings first. And then
[1:16:26] you know what? If it is a hit, if we do
[1:16:28] keep going with it, then I'm all all in.
[1:16:30] I'll support it. We could have one every
[1:16:32] single week if the parents want to get
[1:16:34] behind it. But it's a lot of effort to
[1:16:36] actually get home from work, get
[1:16:39] changed, get across the city with your
[1:16:41] children to actually be involved in
[1:16:43] something. So, I want to be careful. I
[1:16:45] want to I want to be respectful of
[1:16:47] everyone's time, but I want to try and
[1:16:49] carve out a little bit of a space where
[1:16:50] we can begin cultivating the youth to be
[1:16:53] able to play music in the church and to
[1:16:56] be able to manifest the gifts that are
[1:16:58] already there. The gifts are already
[1:17:01] there. It's just up to us to try and
[1:17:03] discover them. We know that the the word
[1:17:05] says that gifts and callings are without
[1:17:06] repentance. They come from God. They're
[1:17:08] not ours. We don't impart a gift into a
[1:17:11] person. So, anyways, that's what that's
[1:17:13] about. The youth services 7:30 on the
[1:17:16] 31st. We've got uh lots of time to plan
[1:17:19] for it. I'm hoping that we won't have
[1:17:21] parents out trick-or-treating with their
[1:17:23] children and participating in the
[1:17:25] worldly pleasures because that's truly
[1:17:27] what it is. Halloween is of the devil,
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; I don't think we need to say that from
[1:17:32] the pulpit.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; But if we're taking and implementing our
[1:17:36] children into worldly Halloween things,
[1:17:39] brothers and sisters, where are we at?
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; We believe this message, don't we? Amen.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; I would say this. Do you think Brother
[1:17:47] Brandon would take his kids
[1:17:48] trick-or-treating?
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; If he would, I doubt he would. So, if he
[1:17:54] wouldn't, why would we?
[1:17:57] It's not legalism. I'm just saying we we
[1:18:00] don't need to uh give any any glory to
[1:18:03] the devil. He's got enough traction in
[1:18:04] this world. Why would we give him an
[1:18:07] ounce?
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; And I know it's a very difficult thing
[1:18:10] because the kids love candy and
[1:18:11] trick-or-treating. We'll buy candy.
[1:18:14] If you want candy, we'll have candy.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; It's not about candy, is it?
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Because you can go to the store and get
[1:18:19] candy. It's about getting in the spirit
[1:18:21] of things. Well, Brother Brandham said
[1:18:22] we ought to get in the spirit of things
[1:18:24] here in the church just as exuberantly
[1:18:27] as they do out there in the world.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; So, why would we want to mess around
[1:18:32] with worldly things?
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Let's get to church and get after it.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Another uh little note here, we have
[1:18:38] brother Cadre Digs coming in November
[1:18:40] 22nd and 23rd. will have two services, a
[1:18:43] Saturday night and a Sunday morning. You
[1:18:45] know, uh I I got I got a few pictures. I
[1:18:48] just wanted to just impart a little bit
[1:18:51] about what happened this last week and
[1:18:52] what's going on uh in general. But uh if
[1:18:56] you want to just go with the slides,
[1:18:58] brother, we'll do the pictures first.
[1:19:00] This uh picture here is what we did.
[1:19:03] This is what we went to do. We went up
[1:19:06] north and uh my brother, he got a wall
[1:19:07] tent and we set up a bear fence and we
[1:19:10] had a little kitchen area set up and we
[1:19:12] just carved out a week of time where we
[1:19:14] could go and take our time to try and do
[1:19:16] this. And so we we got up there and the
[1:19:19] very first day we were able to do this.
[1:19:21] And so obviously you see Benjamin there
[1:19:24] and that's his cousin Austin, my older
[1:19:26] brother's uh youngest. He's the one that
[1:19:29] killed it. It's his very first bull and
[1:19:31] uh it's it's a doozy. It's a big one.
[1:19:34] And I asked him how big is this because
[1:19:35] I've never seen a moose on the ground
[1:19:37] and he said he thought it was a pretty
[1:19:40] good one and uh it is I compared it with
[1:19:43] some bones from another one and it's
[1:19:44] probably double the size. So I think in
[1:19:47] terms of moose it's probably a medium to
[1:19:49] large Canadian moose like uh Alberta
[1:19:52] moose anyways. There's some really big
[1:19:54] ones up north. But so if you want to go
[1:19:56] to the next one that's uh I shared it on
[1:19:59] the on the link but just to show you
[1:20:02] what it's like to get out there. You
[1:20:03] know, you have the daytime adventure and
[1:20:04] then the nighttime
[1:20:06] the Lord just comes by your way. And you
[1:20:09] know, I just had a little jubilee myself
[1:20:11] with the Lord. And uh it wasn't a great
[1:20:13] tremendous prayer meetings. It wasn't
[1:20:15] anything like that. But what it was was
[1:20:17] we're able to just simply be together.
[1:20:20] And you know, my brother and his son
[1:20:22] were so respectful and and my nephew was
[1:20:24] there as well, Joey. And you know, every
[1:20:27] time we had a meal, we just we just said
[1:20:29] grace. and I just got up and, you know,
[1:20:32] read my Bible and everyone was just very
[1:20:34] very respectful with with us there. I I
[1:20:36] thought it was wonderful. And, you know,
[1:20:39] as you see the vivid northern lights, I
[1:20:42] don't know if you've experienced it
[1:20:43] yourself, if you've ever gone and slept
[1:20:45] out in the open like that, the the
[1:20:48] dreams that I had were so vivid, they
[1:20:51] were just as vivid as the northern
[1:20:52] lights. And I'm saying all this for a
[1:20:55] reason because I want to try and
[1:20:56] encourage the brothers. Um, get your
[1:20:59] children out. If you can get out in the
[1:21:01] woods, go rent a cabin, take a tent, uh,
[1:21:04] find a way, rent an RV, go and do stuff
[1:21:07] with your your family. It is so
[1:21:09] important. Uh, we'll get into maybe that
[1:21:12] later. Um, is there another picture
[1:21:14] there? That's it for pictures. Yeah, I
[1:21:16] didn't really want to go too far. Now,
[1:21:19] uh, I I just thought it was a wonderful
[1:21:20] time and I I wanted to share a little
[1:21:22] bit with you. Maybe Lord willing, we'll
[1:21:24] be able to share a little meat. We don't
[1:21:25] have uh free rain to all of the meat
[1:21:28] from this moose because it wasn't our
[1:21:30] moose. We were just there for the uh
[1:21:32] adventure. I bought some tags and so did
[1:21:35] Benjamin, but we never got anything
[1:21:37] else. It was just a moose and uh you
[1:21:39] know, people prayed for it and and the
[1:21:41] Lord really delivered. So, it was a
[1:21:43] wonderful thing.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you all. If you want to go to the
[1:21:47] next slide, I think it's a pretty
[1:21:48] incredible thing. I don't know if
[1:21:50] anybody has heard about this. If you
[1:21:52] haven't, you might want to look it up.
[1:21:54] You can't really see it there. I
[1:21:55] apologize. This is called Communion
[1:21:59] America.
[1:22:00] Communion America. And it's supposed to
[1:22:04] start October the 9th and go through to
[1:22:06] October the 12th. And what they're going
[1:22:09] to do is have a revival in the US in
[1:22:13] Washington in the capital of the United
[1:22:15] States. They're going to have a
[1:22:17] communion on the last day. It it says
[1:22:21] 2025 is the time to gather not around
[1:22:24] celebrity personalities but for a great
[1:22:26] communion revival centered on Jesus who
[1:22:29] is alive, well, and moving right now in
[1:22:31] this generation. He is the dream of a
[1:22:34] generation. I think that's so amazing uh
[1:22:38] wording. He's not the dream of a
[1:22:40] generation, is he? He's a reality of a
[1:22:43] generation.
[1:22:45] says, "We're gathering on the National
[1:22:47] Mall in Washington DC for 4 days, the tw
[1:22:51] the 9th to the 12th in 50 tents of
[1:22:54] non-stop worship, one tent for each
[1:22:57] state with thousands of worshippers,
[1:23:00] prayer, gospel proclamation, and
[1:23:03] commissioning every night. On October
[1:23:06] 11th, we will host a communion table the
[1:23:10] length of the whole National Mall in
[1:23:13] Washington DC. It's a festival around
[1:23:17] the presence of God.
[1:23:19] They're doing this. It's coming up next
[1:23:21] week.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; It's tremendous to think about when you
[1:23:25] know what brother Brandham said in the
[1:23:27] message of the hour.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; But I don't know if we could actually
[1:23:31] even put it into perspective how far a
[1:23:34] mile is. They're planning a communion
[1:23:36] table over a mile long
[1:23:40] and they're going to come and get
[1:23:41] together and do all of this. This is the
[1:23:43] ecumenical move. Can you play the last
[1:23:45] one, brother?
[1:23:47] I think there was two of those slides.
[1:23:50] If not, it's okay. Okay. I apologize. I
[1:23:54] thought I put two in. That's just fine.
[1:23:57] I think it's amazing to see that
[1:23:59] happening. You know, brother Brandham
[1:24:00] talked about how if you want to see what
[1:24:02] time it is, just take a look at Israel
[1:24:04] in terms of God's time piece, we have
[1:24:06] the ability to see what's going on
[1:24:08] through the lens of the message. And and
[1:24:10] I typed it in, a few different hits came
[1:24:14] up and uh
[1:24:16] brother Brandham, he says this in what
[1:24:19] is it? uh
[1:24:23] in the sixth seal
[1:24:25] talking about this communion America.
[1:24:27] They're getting together to celebrate
[1:24:30] Jesus Christ. They're looking for
[1:24:31] revival. They're really pushing for it.
[1:24:34] Brother Brandom says God will close the
[1:24:35] door one day. He did in the day of Noah
[1:24:38] and they beat on the door. Brother Brham
[1:24:41] knocks on the pulpit. Is that right? Now
[1:24:44] remember the Bible said in that seventh
[1:24:47] watch, right? Is that right? Some fell
[1:24:49] asleep in the first watch, second,
[1:24:52] third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh.
[1:24:54] But in the seventh watch, there came
[1:24:57] forth a proclamation, a cry. The
[1:25:00] bridegroom
[1:25:01] cometh. And we know, we've talked about
[1:25:03] this in the past. This is the wise and
[1:25:06] unwise virgins. They're both virgins.
[1:25:10] There's five wise. There's five unwise.
[1:25:13] They're both virgins to the word of God.
[1:25:15] They both believe in Jesus Christ. They
[1:25:18] both slumbered and slept, but only one
[1:25:22] group of them had oil. The other group
[1:25:25] never had enough oil. Brother Brandham
[1:25:27] talks about this. The sleeping virgins
[1:25:29] say, "S say, I'd like to have some of
[1:25:32] that oil now."
[1:25:34] The bride said, "I got I just got enough
[1:25:37] for myself. Just got enough. If you want
[1:25:40] it, you go pray up."
[1:25:44] So when we see this in the message and
[1:25:46] and you see this taking place naturally,
[1:25:49] they're talking about getting together
[1:25:50] to pray. They're talking to get together
[1:25:53] to have a little bit of a revival in the
[1:25:55] United States of America. But yet we
[1:25:57] have a prophet that said the revival is
[1:25:58] over.
[1:26:00] That revival is done and gone. And what
[1:26:02] you did was you rejected the living word
[1:26:05] for your day.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; You rejected the prophetic utterance
[1:26:10] that God gave. And for that, the only
[1:26:13] thing that's left is judgment.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; And he said, my brother Brandham didn't
[1:26:19] say this, even though it was his voice
[1:26:21] that said it. And people will probably
[1:26:22] get really bent out of shape if you're
[1:26:23] watching this. And maybe if you don't
[1:26:25] believe the message of the hour, but
[1:26:27] what did he say? I indict this
[1:26:29] generation for the second crucifixion of
[1:26:32] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; How did they do that? They rejected the
[1:26:39] word that was given through a prophetic
[1:26:40] utterance. Oh my, he's a great man. He's
[1:26:42] he's a wonderful man of God. He's got
[1:26:44] many gifts and talents. But when he
[1:26:46] began to actually bring the word of God,
[1:26:49] oh no, we can't take that. No, no, we're
[1:26:51] not going to go there. That is the
[1:26:54] rejecting of God. That's not just the
[1:26:56] rejecting of a a man and his message.
[1:27:01] The bride said, "I got just enough for
[1:27:03] myself. Just got enough. If you want it,
[1:27:06] you go pray it up."
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Don't you see the sleeping virgin? Now
[1:27:10] look at the Episcopalian, the
[1:27:12] Presbyterian, the Lutheran, and
[1:27:13] everything trying to. And the trouble of
[1:27:15] it is instead of trying to get the Holy
[1:27:18] Ghost, they're trying to speak in
[1:27:20] tongues.
[1:27:23] And a lot of them speak in tongues and
[1:27:26] is ashamed to come to this church to be
[1:27:28] prayed for.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Wants me to come to their house and pray
[1:27:33] for them. You call that the Holy Ghost?
[1:27:35] That's speaking in tongues, but not the
[1:27:38] Holy Ghost. See? Now, I love how Brother
[1:27:40] Bradom says this, and this is why I'm
[1:27:42] going a little further with it. He says,
[1:27:43] "Now I believe the Holy Ghost speaks in
[1:27:46] tongues,
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; but it's only one gift."
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; of the nine fruit of the spirit.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; It's only one.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Why would we major on a minor?
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; When we have the giver, why would we
[1:28:00] worry about the gifts? I love how
[1:28:02] Brother Brandham says it. Why would we
[1:28:03] want the shoe or why would we want just
[1:28:05] the tongue when we could have the whole
[1:28:07] shoe?
[1:28:09] Now, I believe in the Holy Ghost speaks
[1:28:11] in tongues. You know, I believe that.
[1:28:13] See, but there's a counterfeit to it,
[1:28:16] too. Yes, sir. The fruits of the spirit
[1:28:20] proves what it is. The fruit of the tree
[1:28:22] proves what kind of a tree it is. Not
[1:28:24] the bark, the fruit.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; And how could you say that? Well, you
[1:28:29] know, I've never heard it before, but
[1:28:30] you could take Brother Brandham talks
[1:28:32] about the brother in Arizona that had
[1:28:33] the lemon tree, right? Yes.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Was it a lemon tree or an orange tree?
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Orange tree. And he the brother had
[1:28:41] grafted in lemons and and tangerines and
[1:28:44] tangelos and and grapefruits. All the
[1:28:46] different citrus fruits he grafted into
[1:28:48] the tree. And all of those branches that
[1:28:50] were grafted in, they live off the life
[1:28:52] of that original tree.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, indeed they do. But if they ever
[1:28:58] bring forth fruit, they're not going to
[1:29:00] bring forth the orange that that tree is
[1:29:02] originally. They're only going to bring
[1:29:04] forth the fruit that's inside of them.
[1:29:06] And Jesus said, "I am the vine. Ye are
[1:29:09] the branches." If we are the same as
[1:29:12] that vine, we will have the same fruit
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; as that vine.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; It won't be a lemon on an orange tree.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; It won't be a counterfeit.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Today, I want to talk about the power of
[1:29:28] his resurrection.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I just think it's
[1:29:32] amazing to look at what's going on
[1:29:34] around this world, to see all of the
[1:29:37] things that are going on. It's
[1:29:39] incredible. We live in an incredible
[1:29:41] time. You know, Brother Bradom, he says
[1:29:43] it I I looked at many different quotes
[1:29:45] and uh if you want to search it out,
[1:29:47] you'll maybe be able to find it and and
[1:29:49] see it. Brother Bradom says that right
[1:29:51] about the time that that unwise virgin
[1:29:54] goes seeking the oil, which is the Holy
[1:29:57] Ghost, we know the oil is the Holy
[1:29:59] Ghost. Yeah,
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; we know that
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; the oil typifies the Holy Ghost. It's
[1:30:04] not just a symbol, a symbolic thing that
[1:30:06] just sounds good in a religious realm.
[1:30:09] It truly is the literal life of Jesus
[1:30:11] Christ and the power of his
[1:30:13] resurrection. And there's two types of
[1:30:15] that manifestation in this world,
[1:30:18] especially in in the Christian world.
[1:30:20] One of them are the people that truly
[1:30:22] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:30:23] Jesus Christ himself, living out through
[1:30:25] their lives. And the other ones live off
[1:30:28] of the example of those people.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; They live off of the experience of the
[1:30:33] other people. That's where Brother
[1:30:35] Emanuel said it when when I was away on
[1:30:38] Wednesday night. He said, "You could
[1:30:39] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[1:30:41] hour of the day and still go to hell.
[1:30:43] That's how you do it. You come to church
[1:30:45] and you see the great manifestation, the
[1:30:47] the presence of God manifesting in our
[1:30:50] service, but never ever willing to
[1:30:52] completely let go of all of what we
[1:30:55] think we know, all of what we've been
[1:30:56] taught and just give way to the Holy
[1:30:58] Ghost. Just yield entirely to the Lord
[1:31:01] so that he can live through our lives.
[1:31:02] That's the difference between the two.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; One has enough oil and one doesn't. one
[1:31:10] observes the one with the oil because
[1:31:13] the shout has already gone forth.
[1:31:14] Brother Brandham declared that
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; the shouts already happened.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; The voice is already happening. The
[1:31:20] voice is the message in the bride.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a trump of the Lord.
[1:31:26] And I don't think it's any accident that
[1:31:28] it's called the trump of God.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Today talking about the power of his
[1:31:34] resurrection. You know, there's one hit
[1:31:36] in the Bible, the power of his
[1:31:37] resurrection. You might be wondering
[1:31:39] where I got this from. It was while we
[1:31:41] were away. Well, I just fellowshipping
[1:31:44] with the Lord. Just just taking in the
[1:31:45] sights and the sounds of being away from
[1:31:47] everything. There's just something so
[1:31:49] powerful of getting away from all that
[1:31:51] we know and just getting alone with one
[1:31:54] another and and the Lord.
[1:31:58] This came to me just really profoundly,
[1:32:00] the power of his resurrection. So, I
[1:32:02] went and looked it up and Paul's
[1:32:04] speaking here, you know, he he talks
[1:32:06] about who he is and and all that he
[1:32:09] knows and all that he's been taught and
[1:32:11] everything from his history and he said,
[1:32:13] "You know what? I have to count all of
[1:32:15] that dong." It was the greatest thing to
[1:32:17] me for the longest time until I actually
[1:32:20] met him personally myself. And when that
[1:32:24] time happened on the road to Damascus,
[1:32:26] he was never the same. He didn't go and
[1:32:28] say, "I've got this tremendous
[1:32:29] experience. God met me, blinded me, and
[1:32:31] and gave me my sight back, and now I can
[1:32:33] go and preach the gospel. No, he had to
[1:32:35] go and actually check it all with the
[1:32:37] word of God. And that's what every one
[1:32:39] of our responsibility is. If we see
[1:32:42] something with this message, we have to
[1:32:43] check it up with the word of God. But
[1:32:45] then understand that it's going to be
[1:32:48] revealed by the Lord to us through his
[1:32:51] word.
[1:32:52] I just love what I heard in the in the
[1:32:54] brother's preacher. I think it was
[1:32:55] brother Emanuel. He said it that there
[1:32:57] is actually there's the knowledge of the
[1:32:59] word. There's the reading of the word,
[1:33:00] but then there's actually the revealing
[1:33:03] of the word. And a man cannot reveal the
[1:33:06] the magnitude or or the revelation of
[1:33:09] the word of God. It has to be revelation
[1:33:12] by the spirit.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Has to be. I certainly appreciated both
[1:33:17] of the services. I know I'm going on
[1:33:19] about brother Emanuel. really enjoyed
[1:33:21] Brother Tobiy's service and I'm so
[1:33:22] thankful to have the gifts in the body
[1:33:24] that can step in and and really minister
[1:33:26] the word of God the way that we need it
[1:33:29] and and to be just so in season, so in
[1:33:31] sync with everything that's going on.
[1:33:33] It's not like we're trying to pull in
[1:33:35] different directions. We're we're we're
[1:33:37] we're going the same way with this word.
[1:33:39] It's just wonderful. I'm certainly
[1:33:41] thankful for that. There's something
[1:33:43] great about understanding the positions
[1:33:45] of our our families and the positions in
[1:33:47] our families and being able to train our
[1:33:50] children the way they need to be taught
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; to encourage them
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; to Jesus Christ.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; And you know, that's one of the reasons
[1:33:59] why I want to do the youth services. We
[1:34:01] had, excuse me, a little bit of an
[1:34:03] exhortation about the youth services and
[1:34:05] I talked about David and how each one of
[1:34:08] these children are little Davids. And if
[1:34:11] you look it up, that's the quote that I
[1:34:13] brought one of them where brother
[1:34:14] Brandham talks about little Davids. And
[1:34:16] uh you know, everyone has the
[1:34:19] opportunity. If you've ever played music
[1:34:21] or gone up on stage for a service, you
[1:34:23] understand what I'm talking about. You
[1:34:25] know what it means to go and slay giants
[1:34:27] because you got to fight your way to get
[1:34:30] on stage. I think anybody that would
[1:34:32] come up here and not have to actually go
[1:34:34] through some level of anxiety to be able
[1:34:37] to do something for the house of the
[1:34:38] Lord oughtn't to be up here
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; because it's a pride thing then. Then
[1:34:44] it's a show. And if we're looking for a
[1:34:45] show, hey, you know what? There's lots
[1:34:47] of places where you can go to actually
[1:34:49] show the talent, the gift that God has
[1:34:51] given you. There's many different bands
[1:34:53] that are looking for musicians. There's
[1:34:55] places that are looking for singers. We
[1:34:57] can do concerts. We can do all of those
[1:34:59] things. But this is worship in the house
[1:35:01] of the Lord. This is revelation by the
[1:35:03] spirit about how I'm supposed to play my
[1:35:05] instrument. Not instruction from a music
[1:35:08] instructor. It's all about the spirit of
[1:35:10] God. But the children that came in on
[1:35:13] the very first night, we just simply
[1:35:15] said, "Who can play the piano? Who can
[1:35:17] play the organ? Who can play the guitar?
[1:35:19] Who can play whatever? Who can do it? If
[1:35:21] you can do it, raise your hand." They
[1:35:23] raised hands. They came up and they
[1:35:25] actually s we sang three or four songs.
[1:35:27] And guess what? We worshiped. The
[1:35:30] presence of God came into the building
[1:35:31] and we worshiped. It was far from
[1:35:33] perfect. But it's not about perfection
[1:35:35] in the way that we would think about it.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; It's making a joyful noise unto the
[1:35:40] Lord.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; And I can't help but think what an
[1:35:42] encouragement that is for the children
[1:35:44] when the adults can be in the back
[1:35:45] worshiping God to the music that they're
[1:35:47] doing.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Tremendous. That to me is the power of
[1:35:53] his resurrection.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; People wanting to worship God. Whether
[1:35:56] it's through song, whether it's through
[1:35:59] music, whether it's just through raising
[1:36:01] your hands and and and opening your
[1:36:03] heart unto the Lord, but the power of
[1:36:06] his resurrection is where we're going
[1:36:07] today. And there's one hit in the Bible.
[1:36:09] That's where I took it from out of
[1:36:11] Philippians. Paul talking about how he's
[1:36:14] not interested in looking at the past.
[1:36:15] He was a a bad guy to the way of the
[1:36:18] apostles view, wasn't he?
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; He was laying the church to waste when
[1:36:22] he talks about zeal. If you want to talk
[1:36:24] about zeal, he was zealous. He was a
[1:36:27] zealot for the word of God.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; But he said, "I count all that dung."
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; I count it all dung.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; All the my former thinking and teaching
[1:36:37] because I press towards the mark for the
[1:36:40] prize of the high calling of God
[1:36:43] through Christ Jesus.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; But you know in the message there's 205
[1:36:50] results for the exact quote. the power
[1:36:54] of his resurrection. And for me, that's
[1:36:56] just amazing because, you know, when you
[1:36:58] look at it, one scripture, one sentence
[1:37:02] can garner 205 hits out of the entire
[1:37:05] message. And I know there's probably
[1:37:06] more, but there's something to this.
[1:37:08] There's some some some weight to this,
[1:37:10] some gravity to this. And I think it's
[1:37:13] just beautiful because it really speaks
[1:37:15] of the consciousness of sunship, of
[1:37:18] recognizing who we are. When we know
[1:37:21] that we are the son of the boss, when we
[1:37:25] know that we're the son of the king,
[1:37:27] when we know that we're the son of our
[1:37:29] parents, when our parents speak and
[1:37:32] introduce us and say, "This is my son."
[1:37:36] Something happens. There's an
[1:37:38] appreciation. There's a consciousness
[1:37:40] that that's my dad. That's my daddy and
[1:37:43] I'm his son. And it doesn't matter what
[1:37:45] I think or feel. It just is that way.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I just appreciate brother
[1:37:51] brother Toby's way of going about it and
[1:37:53] and saying that that's exactly what
[1:37:55] we're doing here as parents. It's
[1:37:57] exactly a type of God dealing with us in
[1:37:59] our lives. And what it's all about is
[1:38:01] reinforcing our identity to us that we
[1:38:06] are sons.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Reinforcing it over and over and over
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; because we're sons.
[1:38:14] We receive correction.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:17] But I say, "Look out, man. If you can't
[1:38:19] receive correction, the moment that I
[1:38:22] can't receive correction, look out." We
[1:38:25] all have to receive it. Because if we're
[1:38:27] not able to receive correction by the
[1:38:29] word of God, then we're not his son.
[1:38:31] That's what his word says. But it also
[1:38:34] says that we're not supposed to work our
[1:38:36] children. We're not supposed to
[1:38:39] discourage our children unto wrath.
[1:38:43] We're supposed to encourage our
[1:38:44] children. And I think it's such an
[1:38:45] amazing thought because that's what he
[1:38:47] does over and over and over again. He
[1:38:49] encourages us to understand who we are.
[1:38:53] How does he do it? He tells us that
[1:38:56] there's no substitute for the truth. And
[1:38:59] that's where it becomes difficult many
[1:39:02] times in our lives because we think well
[1:39:04] we we know this from our past and we
[1:39:06] know that from our past, but does it
[1:39:08] actually blend with our word for our
[1:39:11] day? Does it actually really go hand to
[1:39:15] glove for that? If it doesn't, then
[1:39:17] there's probably something a little bit
[1:39:19] wrong.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; One of these days, God's going to close
[1:39:22] the door. We read that quote out of the
[1:39:24] sixth seal. One of these days, God's
[1:39:26] going to close the door just like he did
[1:39:27] at the day of Noah. He's going to close
[1:39:29] that door. And there's there isn't going
[1:39:30] to be anybody coming in. All that's
[1:39:33] filthy, let them be filthy still, right?
[1:39:36] All that's holy, let them be holy. And
[1:39:38] we know what's going to happen. we'll
[1:39:39] we'll we'll start to see loved ones
[1:39:42] everything will change and by the time
[1:39:44] that happens it's too late we can go and
[1:39:47] repent and and brother Brandham said it
[1:39:49] they they Bible says that they knocked
[1:39:50] on the door pounded on the door no let
[1:39:52] us in let us in and he had to say listen
[1:39:54] I didn't close the door all I did was
[1:39:57] preach the word and that word closed the
[1:40:00] door and it's the same thing today one
[1:40:02] of these days it's going to change and
[1:40:05] it's just going to be the secret sudden
[1:40:08] going way of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be a great persecution
[1:40:13] coming around and kicking indoors and
[1:40:14] hunting us down like dogs. No, that'll
[1:40:17] be the people who are actually left
[1:40:19] behind. The ones that don't actually go
[1:40:21] in the rapture.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; And how do you go in the rapture? How do
[1:40:25] you get there? Just get the Holy Ghost.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, when we have the
[1:40:29] Holy Ghost in our life, we're going to
[1:40:30] stumble and fall.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; We're trapped in this pest house. Amen.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; The difference between the people who
[1:40:36] are with the Holy Ghost, who have the
[1:40:38] Holy Ghost in their life, and the people
[1:40:39] that don't have the Holy Ghost in their
[1:40:40] life, the people that don't have the
[1:40:42] Holy Ghost in their life, they stumble
[1:40:43] and fall and they think, "There's
[1:40:44] nothing to it. Why could I actually ever
[1:40:47] live that? I could never live that. Why
[1:40:49] would I even try? It needs to be no
[1:40:51] longer me, but Christ that lives in me.
[1:40:55] He's the one." And what will happen is
[1:40:57] we'll get up and we'll get our butts
[1:40:59] back to church again. We won't stay down
[1:41:01] and stay away.
[1:41:04] But there's no substitute for the truth.
[1:41:07] There's no substituting the truth. Eve
[1:41:10] tried that. And what happened? Custom
[1:41:12] fig leaves came out. We We're going to
[1:41:15] try and hide ourselves with a new
[1:41:16] religion. We're going to say, you know
[1:41:18] what? We don't have to worship the way
[1:41:19] that God wants us to worship, the way
[1:41:21] that he gave us to worship. What we're
[1:41:22] going to do is is not just feed on the
[1:41:24] tree of life. We're going to feed on the
[1:41:26] tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[1:41:28] We're going to try that for a little
[1:41:29] while. And what happened? We know the
[1:41:31] fall of mankind and and we know why we
[1:41:35] know why it happened. We know how it
[1:41:37] happened. I'm not going to go too far
[1:41:39] into that. But what I am saying is Jesus
[1:41:41] said that not one jot or one tit can
[1:41:45] pass. Not not one jot or one tit. The
[1:41:49] smallest mark in in the Greek
[1:41:52] dictionary. The smallest little tiny
[1:41:55] indicators in the Greek dictionary. Not
[1:41:58] one of those can pass before his will
[1:42:02] will be done. And you know, to have one
[1:42:04] of those off is actually going to be
[1:42:07] death. That's going to be tribulation
[1:42:09] material. To have one jot or one tit
[1:42:11] off,
[1:42:13] not in the hearts of a believer.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; That's not the way it'll go because a
[1:42:18] believer will always say, "Be it unto me
[1:42:19] according to thy word." Lord, I I I
[1:42:21] might not understand it. I don't even
[1:42:22] really be able to to to know it myself.
[1:42:26] I I might not be a a really smart guy,
[1:42:28] but alls I can say is I want to
[1:42:30] surrender unto that word more and more
[1:42:33] in my life. And the more that I
[1:42:34] surrender, the lighter my load.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; The more that I surrender, the more that
[1:42:39] he takes control. That's the way it
[1:42:41] works.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; You know, one word off in the hearts of
[1:42:48] the believer, brother Emanuel said this
[1:42:49] and I just have to say it. One word off
[1:42:51] in the hearts of a believer can
[1:42:52] transpire into one word off into the
[1:42:55] congregation.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; And how important is it for us to be
[1:42:59] established in the present truth? If
[1:43:01] we're not established in the present
[1:43:02] truth, then we're just like every single
[1:43:04] other church in this world.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; And that doesn't puff us up. It humbles
[1:43:08] us. It makes us recognize really where
[1:43:10] we stand.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Those people in Israel are crying out
[1:43:14] for Messiah.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; They really want Messiah. This is the
[1:43:18] year where they sacrifice the first red
[1:43:21] hepher in over 2,000 years. The building
[1:43:24] of the third temple is right there.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; They are longing for Messiah. They're
[1:43:29] crying out for Messiah. Where are we at,
[1:43:32] brothers and sisters? They were blinded
[1:43:34] for our sake, persecuted to the ends of
[1:43:38] the earth so that we could hear this
[1:43:40] gospel today.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:43:44] It's so important for us to recognize
[1:43:46] there's a written word,
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; but there's a revealed word.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; We're willing recipients of the revealed
[1:43:52] word.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Random talks about it.
[1:43:54] We'll get into it a little bit, but the
[1:43:56] the mechanics are one thing. We have
[1:43:59] decades of mechanics. And you know, when
[1:44:02] you live by the law, you die by the law.
[1:44:04] When you just try and extremely
[1:44:07] strain people to live by the letter of
[1:44:10] the law, the children are pretty smart.
[1:44:12] They see it's legalism.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; They see legalism full well. That's what
[1:44:17] happens when you live by the law. You
[1:44:19] have a legalistic perspective. Everyone
[1:44:21] else is wrong. Unless you see it my way,
[1:44:22] you're wrong. Well, God God deals with
[1:44:25] everyone sovereignly. The bride of Jesus
[1:44:28] Christ accepts the revealed word for
[1:44:30] their day. That doesn't mean that
[1:44:32] there's other people that aren't saved.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; What it means is there's some people
[1:44:36] that will go on the rapture and other
[1:44:37] people that will actually be there later
[1:44:39] on.
[1:44:41] But Ephesians 4, you know, we can't we
[1:44:43] can't do away with God's word.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; We cannot do away with God. There's no
[1:44:48] substitute. We said it already. Brother
[1:44:50] Emanuel said it. There's no substitute
[1:44:52] for God's word
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; just because everyone says it because a
[1:44:56] lot of people are doing it. There's no
[1:44:58] substitute for God's word. You can't
[1:44:59] just change God's word.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:11 says, "And he gave some
[1:45:04] apostles, some prophets, some
[1:45:05] evangelists, some pastors, and
[1:45:07] teachers." Why? He didn't just say, "I
[1:45:11] give them to you." He says, "For the
[1:45:14] perfecting of the saints." And remember,
[1:45:15] perfecting is perfect is maturing. The
[1:45:18] maturing of the saints, for the work of
[1:45:21] the ministry, for the edifying of the
[1:45:23] body of Christ.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; And we know the rest of it. It says,
[1:45:27] "Till we all come in the unity of the
[1:45:29] spirit."
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Right? The unity of the faith and the
[1:45:32] knowledge of the son of God unto a
[1:45:34] perfect man, unto the measure of the
[1:45:35] stature of the fullness of Christ. The
[1:45:36] only way that's going to happen is for
[1:45:38] us to forget about what we know
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; to say, "Be it unto me according to thy
[1:45:43] word."
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; You know what? I remember a brother, a
[1:45:46] veteran brother. Many people probably
[1:45:48] weren't here at the time. He said, "I
[1:45:50] struggled my entire life with the Holy
[1:45:53] Ghost, knowing whether I've got the Holy
[1:45:54] Ghost, raised in the message,
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; steeped in tradition, but said, "I want
[1:46:00] to know that I know that I know. And I
[1:46:02] want to get rebaptized in the name of
[1:46:04] the Lord Jesus Christ. So I can drive
[1:46:05] down a stake today, tonight, and say,
[1:46:08] "You don't have any power over me,
[1:46:10] Satan." Because from this time forward,
[1:46:12] I know what's happened. I understand it.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think we need a shakeup like
[1:46:17] that.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Just to say, "Be it unto me according to
[1:46:20] thy word."
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; But are we too too rigid and prideful to
[1:46:25] say, "No, I know it. There's nothing you
[1:46:27] can tell me." Are we? I don't want to be
[1:46:31] that way. We've got to say just like
[1:46:33] Mary, be it unto me according to thy
[1:46:35] word. How else is the spirit of the most
[1:46:38] high going to overshadow us? He's a
[1:46:40] gentleman.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; He's not going to force himself.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; You know, it's manifesting time.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; That's the day that we live in right
[1:46:51] now. Brothers and sisters, I see this
[1:46:54] all going on. I just can't help but
[1:46:56] think something big is just about to
[1:47:00] happen.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Maybe I'm crazy and and and many people
[1:47:04] probably think that and that's okay.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Leave me alone. I like it this way.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; But you know, God has a way. And to try
[1:47:14] and say there's a substitute for it
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; is is shockingly frightening.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; It truly is.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. especially in the ranks of
[1:47:24] of what we call this message for people
[1:47:27] to say that there's another way. Getting
[1:47:29] a little too Pentecostal is is out of
[1:47:32] order.
[1:47:34] No. Brother Brandham said Pentecost is
[1:47:36] an experience, didn't he?
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; It's not a denomination.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; So if someone gets excited about this
[1:47:42] word, that's not wrong.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; It's wrong to try and quench the spirit.
[1:47:50] The word speaks expressly about that out
[1:47:53] of God's provided place of worship in
[1:47:55] 1965. He says, "Then notice, not only
[1:47:58] does he come in by the Holy Spirit, the
[1:48:01] only way we're going to get to know him
[1:48:03] is by the Holy Spirit." By the way, if I
[1:48:04] haven't said it in the last while, you
[1:48:07] got to have the baptism of the Holy
[1:48:08] Ghost.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; I I heard someone preaching it and I
[1:48:12] thought it was good because he says it
[1:48:14] unequivocally. You have to have the
[1:48:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost so that you
[1:48:18] can speak in tongues. And I'm like, "Oh
[1:48:20] man, come on. Come on." But he said it
[1:48:23] so fervently. I was like, "Man, this guy
[1:48:25] sounds like a believer. You
[1:48:26] unequivocally have to have the baptism
[1:48:28] of the Holy Ghost. It's the only way.
[1:48:31] Without it, you're lost." And he's 100%
[1:48:33] right. I'm saying, "Amen." A
[1:48:36] I have to let down. But you know what,
[1:48:39] Brother Brandham, the prophet for this
[1:48:40] age, he said, then notice, not only does
[1:48:43] he come in by the Holy Spirit with the
[1:48:45] learning of his word,
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. He manifests that word.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; That's why I say when we get the ones
[1:48:54] that want to say it's an invisible union
[1:48:56] of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Yep. It is. Sometimes you can't really
[1:49:01] see it initially, but just give it time.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Give it the time test. We talked about
[1:49:06] it like oil and vinegar. You want to
[1:49:08] make a vinegarette dressing, you can get
[1:49:10] it together and emulsify it. Put it in a
[1:49:12] mixer and blend it and it'll it'll be so
[1:49:14] emulsified. It'll just look like one
[1:49:16] liquid. But just give it the time test.
[1:49:18] Just let it sit there on the counter for
[1:49:20] a little bit and you'll see what will
[1:49:21] happen.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; It will separate. Without the baptism of
[1:49:24] the Holy Ghost, that's what's going to
[1:49:25] happen. We will separate also. We can't
[1:49:27] stand. People can't stand the word of
[1:49:30] God in the day in which we live. The
[1:49:32] true word. People want to have some kind
[1:49:34] of a religion that's going to
[1:49:35] accommodate the way they want to live.
[1:49:37] And unfortunately, that's even in the
[1:49:39] ranks of the message of the hour.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; I want to have multiple wives. I want to
[1:49:44] be able to do this. I want to drink on
[1:49:45] the side. I want to be able to do that.
[1:49:47] Everything that I want to do, I can find
[1:49:49] a ministry. You can.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; You'll find a ministry that will give
[1:49:53] you the liberty to do whatever you want.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; God said that he would give them over to
[1:49:58] what?
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; A rep probate mind.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; He will also send them a strong
[1:50:03] delusion. They'll be delusional. They'll
[1:50:06] think, "Oh my, I've got the message of
[1:50:07] the hour. This is okay." It's not okay.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; It's got to line up with the word of
[1:50:12] God. Amen.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; He says then notice, not only does he
[1:50:15] come in by the Holy Spirit with the
[1:50:17] learning of his word. We learn about the
[1:50:19] word. We learn about the message. He
[1:50:21] manifests that word. We become a new
[1:50:23] creature in Christ Jesus.
[1:50:26] Now, I can't remember who who said it,
[1:50:28] whether it was brother Toby or whether
[1:50:30] it was brother Emanuel, but you know, we
[1:50:32] do become a new creature in Christ
[1:50:33] Jesus.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; There comes a time in our life. I think
[1:50:36] it was brother Toby. There comes a time
[1:50:38] in our life where we see a change. It's
[1:50:40] not easy to be a message kid, is it?
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; It's not. He talked about how the
[1:50:45] elders, they had a transformation. They
[1:50:47] came in out of the world. They came from
[1:50:49] denomination and God did something
[1:50:51] wonderful for them in their lives. But
[1:50:53] as a child in the message, you're just
[1:50:55] raised up in the message. But there
[1:50:57] still has to come a time where you come
[1:50:59] to know him personally.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; And how can you tell?
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; He begins to manifest his word in your
[1:51:08] life. How how does that work? I'm going
[1:51:11] to use an example and I hope it's okay.
[1:51:13] Brother Miles, I'm going to I'm going to
[1:51:15] use you, brother. I hope it's okay. We
[1:51:19] prayed for Brother Miles that he would
[1:51:22] find a work co-op in the city of Calgary
[1:51:25] so that he wouldn't have to travel
[1:51:26] abroad to be away from church so that he
[1:51:30] could actually be in service for the
[1:51:32] king.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; That was part of the requirement of the
[1:51:35] prayer. Lord, we want this, but we want
[1:51:38] it this way. For this reason,
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; yes.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; What' God do?
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; God came in
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; by the spirit by the learning of his
[1:51:47] word. We can bring a a prayer and
[1:51:49] supplication to him according to his
[1:51:51] word, which is his will that I want to
[1:51:53] be in service for the king. And God
[1:51:55] comes around and then he manifests it by
[1:51:57] the word. What happens? Oh, you can have
[1:51:59] a co-op right here in the city of
[1:52:00] Calgary. You don't have to leave church.
[1:52:02] You can stay living at home. Amen.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; But that's not it.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes people might be saying,
[1:52:11] "Well, it's just fluke, Brother Barry."
[1:52:13] Is it fluke when we take our prayers to
[1:52:15] the King of Kings and Lord of Lords,
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; and you get what you ask for?
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Then we prayed that he would find the
[1:52:27] perfect job.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; we prayed that he would find the perfect
[1:52:32] job. Now he's in a position which is the
[1:52:35] perfect position.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; We did the same with brother Daniel.
[1:52:39] Where is he? Our song leader. Same
[1:52:42] thing.
[1:52:43] Not just any job, but the perfect job.
[1:52:46] Did you get a perfect job?
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; That's God. That's the God we serve.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; If we want to actually bring our prayers
[1:52:54] and supplications to him, he is
[1:52:56] listening to our prayers.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful. We heard the
[1:53:02] the little testimony. The first time
[1:53:04] that that sister was prayed for, she was
[1:53:07] on the other side. She heard that
[1:53:09] prayer. Can you believe that?
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, have mercy on me." If I
[1:53:14] find myself in a situation where I'm
[1:53:16] absent in the body, but I know I'm
[1:53:18] present with the Lord according to the
[1:53:19] word of God. That I would hear the
[1:53:21] saints of God praying for brother Barry
[1:53:23] and I'd be like, "Hallelujah. Glory to
[1:53:25] God." Oh my. Can you imagine how she
[1:53:28] must have felt? And a second prayer, a
[1:53:32] second prayer brought her back into her
[1:53:34] body.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my, she started to twitch. Not for 20
[1:53:37] days had she moved. And then what? One
[1:53:40] more prayer.
[1:53:42] She gets up and says, "Get the stuff
[1:53:44] together. These people are hungry. We
[1:53:45] need to make tamalies."
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Wonderful testimony.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; That's not fiction, brothers and
[1:53:52] sisters.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. But he comes in by the
[1:53:59] spirit with the learning of his word. We
[1:54:01] say, "Wow, I need to be baptized in the
[1:54:04] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:54:05] remission of sins so that I can actually
[1:54:08] receive that gift of the Holy Ghost for
[1:54:09] myself. It's for me." And then he
[1:54:12] manifests that word. The things that we
[1:54:14] used to love, they just fall off. The
[1:54:16] people that we used to love, they just
[1:54:18] become dull. The places we used to go,
[1:54:21] just not into it. What I really want to
[1:54:24] do is get excited because when I hear
[1:54:26] somebody say there's going to be a
[1:54:28] church service, something jumps inside
[1:54:29] of me. Like David said, I I was excited
[1:54:32] when they said, "Let us go unto the
[1:54:34] house of the Lord."
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; We become a new creature.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; We don't have the old interests in our
[1:54:41] lives.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now remember the prophets
[1:54:45] believe the word. They receive the word
[1:54:48] of God.
[1:54:50] And God, the Holy Spirit, came into them
[1:54:53] and fired that promise out and made it
[1:54:56] come to pass. Oh my, who's going to
[1:54:58] condemn that?
[1:55:00] Who could do that? We know it. We
[1:55:05] preaching to the choir sometimes. Amos
[1:55:07] 3:7, surely the Lord God will do nothing
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; except he first reveal his secret unto
[1:55:13] his servants, the prophets.
[1:55:16] That's that's God's way of doing it
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; and it hasn't changed.
[1:55:21] But I I just, you know, got thinking
[1:55:23] about this the the power of his
[1:55:24] resurrection and the quotes as we get
[1:55:26] into studying.
[1:55:28] 2 Corinthians 7 came to mind. Verse one,
[1:55:31] having therefore these promises, dearly
[1:55:33] beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from
[1:55:37] all filthiness of the flesh and spirit.
[1:55:42] not just of the flesh but of the spirit.
[1:55:46] Perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
[1:55:49] Maturing holiness
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; in the fear of God.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Recognizing
[1:55:55] we were talking about this at home. One
[1:55:57] of the biggest downfalls of of children
[1:56:00] I think it is. Is that right? Is that we
[1:56:03] just lose the God consciousness.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; We just lose the consciousness that God
[1:56:08] is watching
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; that God is listening.
[1:56:12] We're just around the dinner table.
[1:56:15] Nobody else in church can hear us. We
[1:56:17] can talk about that brother or sister or
[1:56:19] or we can just look at that thing or we
[1:56:20] can just think that thing. You know, our
[1:56:22] our thoughts are louder in heaven than
[1:56:24] our voices here on earth.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; It's a tremendous thing to recognize.
[1:56:29] But, you know, we can cleanse ourselves
[1:56:31] from all filthiness of flesh. And how do
[1:56:32] we do that? We just go on our knees and
[1:56:34] say, "Lord, forgive me. Let me die out
[1:56:36] to this pest house that I'm in. I
[1:56:38] recognize this this prison that I'm in."
[1:56:41] And one of these days I'm going to be
[1:56:42] set free from it. Whether I go by the
[1:56:44] way of the grave or the great trump of
[1:56:46] God happens and I go by the way of the
[1:56:47] sky. One one day I'm going to be
[1:56:49] delivered from this pest house. But I'm
[1:56:51] stuck here. And you know that I He knows
[1:56:53] that we are.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; He knows every single every single
[1:56:57] struggle that we're going through. He
[1:56:58] knew the struggle before we were even
[1:57:01] born here on earth.
[1:57:04] Brother Brandham says that he knows
[1:57:06] every single flea,
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; every single time it would bat its eye
[1:57:10] and how much tallow would come off of
[1:57:12] it.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Now, I have trouble even understanding
[1:57:14] that myself because some animals have a
[1:57:17] lot of fleas, but he knows everyone.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; 1964 Jehovah Gyra number two.
[1:57:28] I don't know if I got into this in the
[1:57:30] past, but I I think in the future I
[1:57:32] will. We don't need to prove God's word.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; And sometimes I think we try to we get
[1:57:39] caught up in the hype of the moment and
[1:57:41] we want to try and prove God's word and
[1:57:43] trust that because we do things a
[1:57:44] certain way. And you know, brother
[1:57:46] Brandham said it, if God met someone on
[1:57:48] a certain ground, a certain way, and you
[1:57:51] meet him
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; yourself on a certain ground a certain
[1:57:54] way, that he's obligated to meet you the
[1:57:57] same way. Sometimes in our lives, we can
[1:58:00] do that the way we think that we can do
[1:58:02] that. And God doesn't move the way that
[1:58:04] we want it to happen. That doesn't mean
[1:58:06] that he's not God.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; But we got to be very careful with that.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; God is not going to be moved by anything
[1:58:13] that we can do as a human.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; The only thing that's going to move him
[1:58:17] is faith.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Faith in his word.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; But he is the only interpreter of his
[1:58:25] word. Amen.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take a scholar. It doesn't
[1:58:28] take a great message ministry. And I'm
[1:58:32] not throwing off on anyone. What I am
[1:58:33] saying is it takes revelation by the
[1:58:36] spirit is what the seventh angel
[1:58:38] messenger said.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 129 here it says, "But God
[1:58:44] don't need nobody to interpret him. He
[1:58:46] is his own interpreter."
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; He don't need nobody to interpret him.
[1:58:51] Nobody. He makes the promise, then he
[1:58:55] brings it to pass. And that's
[1:58:57] interpretation of it by bringing it to
[1:59:01] pass in our lives by bringing a prayer
[1:59:04] and a supplication. Bringing it to the
[1:59:07] Lord in a prayer meeting, by the way,
[1:59:10] and just giving it to the Lord with a
[1:59:12] few faithful saints and saying, "I trust
[1:59:14] you, Lord, that you will be able to make
[1:59:16] this happen the way that you want it to
[1:59:18] happen." and then sit back and watch and
[1:59:21] give God the glory. Say, "Thank you,
[1:59:23] Lord, for making this come to pass
[1:59:25] according to your word. Thank you, Lord,
[1:59:26] for interpreting this by bringing it to
[1:59:28] pass in my life the way that you want it
[1:59:30] to happen because I know that I'm going
[1:59:32] to graduate and I know that I'm going to
[1:59:33] get a job somewhere. So, why wouldn't
[1:59:35] you provide that perfect job for me
[1:59:38] anyways?"
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; What a tremendous thing it is.
[1:59:41] I just think it's so beautiful, don't
[1:59:43] you, to see the young brothers,
[1:59:45] believers of this word, raised in the
[1:59:47] message, and then come to the place now
[1:59:49] where we've got to make real world big
[1:59:51] people decisions and just trust the Lord
[1:59:53] with all your heart and lean not unto
[1:59:55] your own understanding, but in all of
[1:59:57] your ways, man, that's the key. All of
[2:00:01] your ways, not most of them, not
[2:00:03] Wednesdays and Sundays, not
[2:00:05] threequarters of them, all of your ways,
[2:00:08] acknowledge him and he shall direct your
[2:00:11] paths.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; He makes the promise, then he brings it
[2:00:15] to pass. And that's interpretation of
[2:00:17] it. No one has to interpret it. God
[2:00:19] don't ask no one.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible is of no private
[2:00:24] interpretation. I love that because some
[2:00:26] people would say, "Well, it takes a
[2:00:28] prophet
[2:00:29] Indeed it does. Indeed it does. The
[2:00:33] seventh angel messenger said it very
[2:00:34] clearly. If what's happening is
[2:00:36] happening, what I think is happening is
[2:00:38] happening. There won't be two of us
[2:00:39] standing here at the same time. We can
[2:00:42] get into the really deep things of this,
[2:00:43] but I'm not going to today. We know that
[2:00:45] a a mighty angel descended with an open
[2:00:47] book in his hand, and it wasn't brother
[2:00:49] Brandham.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; It wasn't brother Brandham that did that
[2:00:53] put one foot on the sea and one foot on
[2:00:55] the earth and declared complete
[2:00:56] ownership over all of it.
[2:00:59] with a rainbow about his head. Who had a
[2:01:00] rainbow about his head? We know who
[2:01:02] exactly who that is. The angel of the
[2:01:03] covenant, the Lord Jesus Christ himself
[2:01:06] shall descend out of heaven with a
[2:01:09] shout. And that is what he did. And then
[2:01:12] he took that shout and gave it unto man.
[2:01:14] And it became the voice. And that is
[2:01:16] what is resounding here today and and
[2:01:18] does every time we get together and
[2:01:20] fellowship around this word. It is the
[2:01:22] voice of the resurrection. the power of
[2:01:26] his resurrection in our ears. The more
[2:01:28] we say amen to that word, the more we
[2:01:31] see the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[2:01:33] today.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; And that's the key I want to get to. We
[2:01:37] need to see the resurrection of Jesus
[2:01:39] Christ today. It's beautiful 2,000 years
[2:01:40] ago. Without it, we wouldn't have any
[2:01:42] salvation.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; There had to be a manifestation of that.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; But where is it today?
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Is it something we just talk about? Or
[2:01:50] can we actually show our children there
[2:01:52] is a God with skin on? There is a living
[2:01:55] God. We do believe in a living word.
[2:01:58] That's why we call this assembly the
[2:02:00] living word assembly in Calvary because
[2:02:02] God is alive today.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; He makes the promise.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Then he brings it to pass.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; And that's the interpretation of it.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; No one has to interpret it.
[2:02:19] It's so dangerous when we think someone
[2:02:22] has to interpret this word of God.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful the way he did it? He
[2:02:29] raised up a prophet, a hillbilly
[2:02:31] Kentucky hillbilly out of Kentucky to
[2:02:34] come and bring this word and and and to
[2:02:36] be able to actually have it recorded.
[2:02:38] the magnetic recording device was
[2:02:39] released. That technology was released
[2:02:41] and the prophet the the the prophetic
[2:02:44] office was released and everything was
[2:02:45] released all at the same time and went
[2:02:47] around the world seven times and
[2:02:48] everything just happened and here we are
[2:02:50] today with this word. He doesn't need
[2:02:53] anybody to interpret this word.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Nobody. There's no eighth messenger.
[2:02:58] There's no seven and a half.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Nobody interprets this word except for
[2:03:02] the Holy Ghost.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; It's only revealed by the spirit. And
[2:03:06] that's why he said in the church age
[2:03:07] book, you've got to get in the spirit
[2:03:09] first. Get in the spirit.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Forget about all the rest of it. Push it
[2:03:12] all back aside. Just get in the spirit.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; And let him reveal it to us. He is the
[2:03:17] teacher.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Said it before that, you know, some
[2:03:21] people believe that we need a prophet to
[2:03:24] interpret the word. And sure enough, we
[2:03:26] do. And he did.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Didn't he?
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; He came and he brought this word the way
[2:03:32] that God wanted it delivered. Yeah,
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; he told it to us the way that we needed
[2:03:36] it. It's no accident that it was given
[2:03:38] to us in the grammar that it was given
[2:03:40] to us in. It's no accident that it was
[2:03:42] given to this world, I'm going to say it
[2:03:44] this way, to this world in English.
[2:03:47] Why wasn't it given to this world in
[2:03:49] Spanish? Why wasn't it given to this
[2:03:51] world in Cantonese?
[2:03:53] Why was it English? It's no accident.
[2:03:56] I've I've said it before. It's pretty
[2:03:58] amazing that, you know, we would see the
[2:04:00] the word of God
[2:04:03] manifest through a seventh angel
[2:04:05] messenger. It's pretty amazing that we
[2:04:06] could be here and and and see it. And I
[2:04:09] had a brother say to me one time, "Isn't
[2:04:11] it amazing to think that God would
[2:04:13] actually raise up an entire nation
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; so that that prophetic utterance could
[2:04:18] come out of it?"
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; To me, that's astounding. But that's the
[2:04:23] God we serve. Just like every single
[2:04:25] flea that bats his eye, he knows about
[2:04:27] it. Right? Every hair that's on our
[2:04:28] head, he knows about it.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; He makes the promise, then he brings it
[2:04:32] to pass.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; And that's the interpretation of it. So,
[2:04:36] if he's made a promise in the Bible,
[2:04:38] brothers and sisters, I'm probably going
[2:04:39] to dig into this a little bit later. If
[2:04:41] he makes a promise in the Bible, then
[2:04:43] it's up to him to interpret it. It's up
[2:04:45] to him to bring it to pass. That's how
[2:04:46] he interprets it.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; He doesn't give us a head knowledge to
[2:04:49] say, "I've got the the knowledge of
[2:04:51] this. I've got the grammar way of
[2:04:54] understanding it in this way and that
[2:04:56] way and the other way and before long
[2:04:59] we're so far out on branches that we're
[2:05:01] confused ourselves.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; No, it's revelation by the spirit and he
[2:05:05] keeps it simple.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; The Bible is of no private
[2:05:09] interpretation. And that's what happens
[2:05:11] when you get the great teachers that
[2:05:12] want to take this word and try and do
[2:05:14] something with it. It's not a teacher's
[2:05:16] responsibility. It's the spirit's
[2:05:18] responsibility. And if we say that we
[2:05:20] wish that God sent us a prophet so the
[2:05:22] prophet could actually help us go a
[2:05:24] little further with it. The prophet that
[2:05:25] was in the land that said there won't be
[2:05:26] two of us at the same time if what's
[2:05:29] happening is happening.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; He said there is a prophet in the land
[2:05:33] and that prophet is the Holy Ghost.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; He is the prophet.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the prophet. The Bible
[2:05:42] is of no private interpretation. When we
[2:05:44] start hearing, oh my, there's a a
[2:05:46] teaching that's that's private. It's
[2:05:48] like this. I mean, it's as crazy as
[2:05:50] saying, you know, we'll baptize someone
[2:05:52] in the name of Rosco. We'll we'll pray
[2:05:55] in the name of Rosco. Are you serious?
[2:05:59] People doing that? Of course they are.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, they are.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; They're seducing spirits.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; Evil spirits
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; wrapped up in religion claiming to be of
[2:06:10] Christ.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; The prophet in our day, he said, "As
[2:06:14] long as you do that, you call me
[2:06:15] Antichrist. You make me antichrist and
[2:06:17] I'm going to take myself off. I have to
[2:06:19] take myself off the field because I
[2:06:20] won't stand for it.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; You fix that up. You make that right and
[2:06:25] then I'll come back on the field. Until
[2:06:27] you do, that ain't happening. And it's
[2:06:29] interesting because it was just before
[2:06:30] the seals were released.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; He knows his men will be honest with the
[2:06:36] word. They'll stay true to it.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Goes on to say, "Everybody trying to say
[2:06:40] it means this, that, let God speak for
[2:06:43] himself.
[2:06:45] Just let God speak for himself. He's the
[2:06:47] one that does it. He made the promise.
[2:06:50] He stands behind it. He does to
[2:06:52] believers.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; He doesn't stand behind it for everyone.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:06:59] no, no.
[2:07:02] We know that all things work together to
[2:07:04] the good, right?
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Not for everyone.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; To those who are called
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; according to his purpose. Those are the
[2:07:13] ones that it works out to the good for.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; It's not for everyone.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; You know what? I just couldn't help but
[2:07:21] think as I was studying this out, how
[2:07:23] how do I prove it? How do I prove that I
[2:07:25] I've got the Holy Ghost? How do I prove
[2:07:27] that God is actually working in my life?
[2:07:30] How do I prove that I've got the Holy
[2:07:31] Ghost? How And many times we just need
[2:07:33] to prove to ourselves. Right.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Forget about all the other people.
[2:07:37] Sometimes our parents might be grilling
[2:07:39] us a little bit about it, but or or
[2:07:41] brothers or sisters, but you know, we
[2:07:43] don't have to prove nothing is what I
[2:07:44] want to say. It's up to God to prove it.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; It's up to us to be faithful.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; To simply get up and go to church.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; You see the people that say, "I've got
[2:07:53] such a great grand revelation of the
[2:07:56] word of God, but can't come to church."
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; I say, "What message do you believe?"
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; I mean, we believe it or not.
[2:08:08] Do we halfway believe the message of the
[2:08:09] hour or do we all the way believe the
[2:08:11] message of the hour? If we all the way
[2:08:12] believe the message of the hour, then
[2:08:14] we're going to want to be in church
[2:08:15] every time the doors are open.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said. We can't
[2:08:21] always. Sometimes we have to work. But
[2:08:23] if we're actually just staying home and
[2:08:25] doing other things, if we're just
[2:08:26] booking things just because what is it?
[2:08:29] What? What is it?
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; That's not the spirit of Christ.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:34] But how do I prove God's word? God
[2:08:36] proves his own word.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; We don't have to prove nothing. The only
[2:08:40] thing we've got to do is be faithful.
[2:08:42] And what I mean by that is patient.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; We've got to be patient in our position.
[2:08:48] You know, it's not an actual sprinting
[2:08:50] race. If anybody here has ever ran a
[2:08:52] marathon, you know what I'm talking
[2:08:53] about. If you've got a long destination
[2:08:55] that you've got to go on your feet, you
[2:08:58] know what I mean. You have to pace
[2:09:00] yourself. You don't want to blow all
[2:09:02] your energy right away. You're going to
[2:09:04] need it later on. But, you know,
[2:09:06] sometimes just being able to go to
[2:09:08] church is a struggle seemingly. It's
[2:09:12] tough. The devil just wants to keep us
[2:09:14] away.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; But if we're willing to say, "Shut up
[2:09:18] flesh.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; You don't reign.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; God reigns in this flesh."
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to follow the word of God
[2:09:25] for my day. God will prove his word if
[2:09:28] we are faithful.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:32] How does God vindicate his word? I just
[2:09:34] have to say it. How does he vindicate
[2:09:36] his word? He brings it to pass
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; and alls we need to do is commit it unto
[2:09:42] him. Commit all of our ways unto the
[2:09:44] Lord.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; Just give it unto him and allow him to
[2:09:47] work it out in our lives. You know,
[2:09:49] talking about the power of the
[2:09:51] resurrection. Let's turn over to Hebrews
[2:09:53] chapter 10.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; I can see we're just about out of time
[2:09:56] and I feel like I'm just wanting to get
[2:09:58] started just like usual. It's beautiful.
[2:10:01] Hebrews chapter 10. We're not talking
[2:10:04] about looking back to the old things as
[2:10:06] Paul said. We're we're interested in
[2:10:08] looking forward to the new things,
[2:10:09] pressing towards the mark of the prize
[2:10:12] of the high calling of God in Christ
[2:10:14] Jesus, understanding that there is a a a
[2:10:18] power of his resurrection and and can
[2:10:20] you see that power of his resurrection
[2:10:23] in your life? That's really what I
[2:10:24] wanted to say today, brothers and
[2:10:26] sisters. Can you see that? Is it
[2:10:28] happening in your life? Because if it's
[2:10:30] not, then there's something maybe just
[2:10:32] that needs to be changed just a little
[2:10:34] bit. And I guarantee you, you will see
[2:10:36] it. Sometimes in our lives, we have a
[2:10:38] great experience maybe years ago and and
[2:10:41] and our experience can get cold. We
[2:10:43] heard about it when we were in the
[2:10:44] States. Sometimes we just deviate a
[2:10:47] little bit, man. We just let one thing
[2:10:49] slide. And maybe we just don't stop
[2:10:50] going to church on Wednesday nights and
[2:10:52] you know we're busy with work and our
[2:10:54] lives and things happen and we just let
[2:10:56] that one little thing slip and before
[2:10:58] long this other thing over here just
[2:11:00] begins to slip and before long these
[2:11:02] other things all over the place are
[2:11:04] slipping and we wonder how did we ever
[2:11:05] get to this position.
[2:11:08] God allows us to get there so that we'll
[2:11:10] look up
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; and say how did I get here?
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; But that's the God we serve.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want to beat us up. He wants
[2:11:18] to love us.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; In Hebrews chapter 10 verse 14
[2:11:28] by one offering
[2:11:30] he hath perfected forever
[2:11:32] them that are sanctified.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Alls we need to do is celebrate that.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; Many times we want to have an offering.
[2:11:43] We want to have some great thing that
[2:11:45] we've done. I've got this thing that
[2:11:47] I've got to do. You know what? He's done
[2:11:49] it all.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Alls we need to do is be willing to
[2:11:52] acknowledge him in this marathon race
[2:11:55] that we're running. Follow him according
[2:11:57] to the instruction that we're given,
[2:11:58] according to the word for our day, which
[2:12:00] will perfect our bodies to receive that
[2:12:03] word and one day change our bodies.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; But don't think that we're just one day
[2:12:08] magically going to have that change of a
[2:12:10] body and we're going to have a change of
[2:12:11] a character because that ain't
[2:12:12] happening. You got to get this character
[2:12:15] right here first.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Once this character is right, then these
[2:12:18] bodies will be changed. We heard about
[2:12:20] it again this last week. Once the bride
[2:12:23] recognizes, once the church recognizes
[2:12:25] what it is, then the rapture will go,
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; reinforcing sunship, encouraging us to
[2:12:32] good works. But Hebrews 10:14, it says,
[2:12:37] "For by one offering, he hath perfected
[2:12:39] forever
[2:12:40] them that are sanctified, whereof the
[2:12:43] Holy Ghost also is a witness to us, that
[2:12:47] after he had said before,
[2:12:52] oh my, this is where I'm going to really
[2:12:53] start preaching, brothers and sisters.
[2:12:54] This is the what?
[2:12:57] This is the covenant. The covenant, not
[2:12:59] something that we made, something that
[2:13:00] he made. This is the covenant that I
[2:13:03] will make with them after those days,
[2:13:05] sayaeth the Lord. I will put my laws
[2:13:09] into their hearts.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; They're not going to go into their
[2:13:13] hearts without the Holy Ghost. We can
[2:13:16] read and read and read and read and
[2:13:17] read, be ever learning, and never able
[2:13:20] to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[2:13:22] It has got to be God himself, the Holy
[2:13:24] Ghost, revealing this word to us. And
[2:13:27] that is him putting his laws into their
[2:13:30] hearts and into their minds will I write
[2:13:34] them.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; We'll be striving to serve him according
[2:13:38] to his word for our day.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; And their sins and iniquities will I
[2:13:46] remember no more.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that?
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, I don't want to
[2:13:52] say this is something that's coming in
[2:13:54] the future. Some people want to put it
[2:13:55] off and say this is coming in the
[2:13:57] future. I want to say it the way the
[2:13:58] prophet said it.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; This day, this scripture is fulfilled in
[2:14:04] your ears.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; This day we can say that our sins and
[2:14:09] iniquities he will remember no more.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; How could we remain silent over that?
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not saying we are, but I just
[2:14:19] can't help but think, you know, that
[2:14:21] makes me want to have a Pentecostal
[2:14:22] revival myself. to think that he's not
[2:14:24] going to remember my sin or my iniquity.
[2:14:26] They're cast into the sea of his
[2:14:28] forgetfulness. Let me do that myself
[2:14:30] with my own sin and iniquity. Cast them
[2:14:33] into the sea of his forgetfulness. Help
[2:14:35] me not remember them anymore.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Verse 18 says, "Now where remission of
[2:14:40] these is, oh boy, there is no more
[2:14:44] offering for sin." Right
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; now, some would say, "Wow, you can
[2:14:51] actually do whatever you want now
[2:14:52] because you're going to make it. It's
[2:14:54] just fine." Yep, you can do whatever you
[2:14:57] want. You're a free will agent. Go and
[2:14:59] have a little sippy. Go and have a
[2:15:00] little smoky. Go and watch and listen
[2:15:03] and do whatever. We can do all of that,
[2:15:05] but we don't want to,
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet told us through a
[2:15:10] prophetic utterance from the throne of
[2:15:11] God, "These things don't please me.
[2:15:14] They're all attributes of something that
[2:15:16] I don't like. And that thing that I
[2:15:18] don't like is unbelief in my word.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; But we're talking about something here
[2:15:24] in Hebrews.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 16. This is the covenant that I
[2:15:29] will make with them after those days,
[2:15:30] sayeth the Lord. I will put my laws into
[2:15:32] their hearts, and into their mind will I
[2:15:34] write them, and their sin and iniquities
[2:15:36] will I remember no more. Now where
[2:15:38] remission of these is, there is no more
[2:15:40] offering for sin. Having therefore,
[2:15:43] brethren, boldness to enter into the
[2:15:46] holiest by the blood of Jesus. Oh my.
[2:15:49] This is what I wanted to get to,
[2:15:50] brothers and sisters. Once upon a time,
[2:15:52] the children of Israel longed to see
[2:15:55] what was behind that veil. Now, that
[2:15:57] veil is torn wide open. And we have full
[2:16:00] access. Let us come boldly with
[2:16:02] assurance that he's expecting us.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; He's not just looking hoping that he's
[2:16:07] going to see us. He's expecting to see
[2:16:08] us.
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; How?
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; By a new and living way.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; The resurrected Jesus Christ in our
[2:16:17] lives.
[2:16:19] The power of his resurrection is going
[2:16:21] to constrain us to come according to his
[2:16:25] word by a new and living way which he
[2:16:29] hath consecrated for us through the veil
[2:16:32] that is to say his flesh
[2:16:36] and having an high priest over the house
[2:16:38] of God.
[2:16:40] Let us draw near with a true heart.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, let us draw near.
[2:16:46] Let us draw near with a true heart.
[2:16:48] Amen.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; In full assurance
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; of faith
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; knowing that he has already done it all,
[2:16:56] man. He's done it all. He's paid the
[2:16:57] full sacrifice for our sin and iniquity.
[2:17:00] He's put them away. There's no more
[2:17:02] remembrance of it. He doesn't even know
[2:17:04] it. We say, "Lord, forgive me." He says,
[2:17:06] "For what?"
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; For what?
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't give us license to go and
[2:17:12] sin. It doesn't give us license to go
[2:17:14] and do things that we know we ought to
[2:17:16] do. Having our hearts sprinkled from an
[2:17:19] evil conscience, we no longer desire to
[2:17:22] hang out with those friends. We no
[2:17:23] longer desire to watch those things. We
[2:17:25] no longer desire to look back and think
[2:17:28] about all the bad things that I've done
[2:17:30] in my life and I could just never have
[2:17:31] the success in our our our life that we
[2:17:34] want to have. No, we don't do that.
[2:17:35] We've been sprinkled from an evil
[2:17:37] conscience and our bodies are washed
[2:17:39] with pure water.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; What water?
[2:17:43] We come to church to have a shower and a
[2:17:45] bath, don't we? So
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; that's why we come here for the washing
[2:17:48] of the water by the word.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; And you know, brothers and sisters, I've
[2:17:52] said it many times, but I'll say it from
[2:17:54] the pulpit. If somebody comes in here
[2:17:56] ill-dressed, maybe smelly of cigarettes
[2:17:58] or maybe weed or whatever it is, bring
[2:18:00] them in.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Let's get them washed up by the water of
[2:18:03] the word, how are they ever going to
[2:18:05] hear it? How are they ever going to see
[2:18:06] it if we're not willing to even let them
[2:18:08] in? Amen.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; We're not better than them.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; Outside of an experience on our own,
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; we're just the same.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; And given the pressures of this world,
[2:18:22] oh my, there's no escaping it.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; There's no escaping the pressures of
[2:18:26] this world outside of Jesus Christ
[2:18:29] himself. The true baptism of the Holy
[2:18:32] Ghost in our lives. But what we're
[2:18:33] talking about here is the resurrection
[2:18:34] of Jesus Christ. The power of his
[2:18:37] resurrection. I think is just scratching
[2:18:39] the surface of really where I want to
[2:18:41] get into, brothers and sisters, but I
[2:18:42] can see I'm over time now. It's it's
[2:18:44] amazing to see this. I'll call the
[2:18:46] musicians and try and and bring it in
[2:18:48] for landing here. But, you know, we're
[2:18:50] talking about a new and living way. And
[2:18:53] that is the living life of Jesus Christ
[2:18:56] living out through us. Not maybe like we
[2:18:58] see in some of the mega churches. Not
[2:19:00] that it makes us better, but we're
[2:19:02] willing to take the word over
[2:19:03] everything.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for a rock concert.
[2:19:07] We're not looking for ultimate
[2:19:08] performance. What we're looking for is
[2:19:10] the spirit of Jesus Christ
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; so that people can come in and actually
[2:19:14] be changed. Hearts can be encouraged to
[2:19:17] the word of God. Children can come to
[2:19:19] know the Lord in the power of his
[2:19:21] resurrection. Sinners can be saved.
[2:19:23] That's what we're doing here. That's
[2:19:25] what this is all about.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; It's not about patting ourselves on the
[2:19:28] back and saying what good people we are.
[2:19:30] We're ranked sinners saved by grace.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:19:36] But we can't change God's program.
[2:19:39] We can't eliminate any scripture.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; I was thinking about this as I was
[2:19:45] studying. You know, outside of the Holy
[2:19:47] Ghost in our lives,
[2:19:50] my the devil is is a master of the
[2:19:54] scripture.
[2:19:56] Satan knows this word better than any
[2:19:58] human ever will.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; But boy oh boy, when we have the spirit
[2:20:02] of Christ inside of us,
[2:20:05] There's no match for Satan.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Satan meets the matchless one.
[2:20:11] But he doesn't believe it. And that's
[2:20:12] why we get sorely tempted over and over
[2:20:14] and over again because he doesn't
[2:20:16] believe it. He just doesn't believe it
[2:20:18] that God would come down and and and and
[2:20:22] condescend so far that he would inhabit
[2:20:25] the lives of people like you and I.
[2:20:27] Amen.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; My
[2:20:32] I just want to say maybe stand with me
[2:20:34] as we close here. You know, out of it is
[2:20:36] the rising of the sun. It's a the last
[2:20:39] quote that I'll bring. I just think it's
[2:20:41] so good. Brother Brandham, he says there
[2:20:43] has been churches, churches, brides,
[2:20:45] brides, churches, brides, brides. But
[2:20:48] there's got to come one. Hallelujah.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; There's got to come a real bride.
[2:20:54] And you know that real bride is going to
[2:20:56] be the one that goes on to make herself
[2:20:58] ready in the book of Revelation. She's
[2:21:00] going to be the one that becomes wife
[2:21:03] because she has a consecration of the
[2:21:05] marriage. She has a true relationship
[2:21:10] with her husband.
[2:21:12] But he says, "But there has to be one
[2:21:14] that's not only got the mechanics, but
[2:21:17] the dynamics of it makes that church
[2:21:20] live, move in the power of his
[2:21:23] resurrection."
[2:21:25] Until we come to that place, until we
[2:21:28] find that place, what good does it do to
[2:21:31] polish the hubs?
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; What good does it do to give her a
[2:21:35] facelift or a Simonized job? He's
[2:21:37] talking about a car and polishing it up
[2:21:39] and doing all the things we can do to a
[2:21:40] car. What good does it do to do that to
[2:21:42] our lives? What good does it do to do
[2:21:44] that to our church until we have the
[2:21:47] dynamic power of the resurrected Jesus
[2:21:49] Christ living out through us? What good
[2:21:51] does it do?
[2:21:54] He says, "What good does it do to give
[2:21:56] her a facelift or a Simonized job when
[2:21:58] there's no dynamics in it?"
[2:22:01] No matter how much the mechanics prove
[2:22:04] to be right, there has got to be a
[2:22:07] dynamics to make it work. Amen.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; He says that's what he proved.
[2:22:13] Hallelujah.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; Talking about the resurrection power on
[2:22:17] Easter morning. That's what Easter
[2:22:20] proved. He wasn't only the word, but he
[2:22:22] was God himself. The dynamics in the
[2:22:25] word.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; That made the body of Christ, Jesus
[2:22:30] Christ, cold, stiff, and dead in the
[2:22:31] grave, shaken to life and rise again and
[2:22:35] roll away the stone. I love that because
[2:22:38] it wasn't as though angels came and
[2:22:41] rolled away the stone the way he's
[2:22:42] talking here. It was that resurrecting
[2:22:44] power. And today I just want to
[2:22:45] encourage us brothers and sisters. If
[2:22:47] any of us are caught in a tomb, oh my,
[2:22:49] let's see that resurrecting power come
[2:22:51] and manifest in our lives and maybe a
[2:22:53] way like we've never seen it before. So
[2:22:55] that that stone that's holding us in
[2:22:57] bondage can be rolled away as well.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; Because he is the same yesterday, today,
[2:23:02] and forever.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; The devil wants us to say, "No, you're
[2:23:05] dead. There's no way that you'll ever
[2:23:07] get out of where you're at. There's no
[2:23:08] way that you'll ever see a different
[2:23:10] life. There's no way that you'll ever
[2:23:12] have power over this in your life.
[2:23:14] You're never going to. He's right. But
[2:23:18] Christ already has.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; And if you've got him on the inside,
[2:23:22] you've got that resurrected power.
[2:23:24] You've got a newness of life, a new way
[2:23:27] of living. It's that dynamics in the
[2:23:30] word. That's why brother Brandham said
[2:23:32] the only true evidence of the Holy Ghost
[2:23:33] is your ability to believe the word for
[2:23:35] the day in which you live. That's the
[2:23:36] dynamic power
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; that made the body of Jesus Christ cold,
[2:23:41] stiff, and dead in the grave shaken to
[2:23:42] life and rise again and roll away the
[2:23:44] stone. I am he that was dead. So dead
[2:23:48] till the sun said he was dead. The moon
[2:23:51] said he was dead. The stars said he was
[2:23:53] dead. We know all nature said he was
[2:23:55] dead. Yes.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; And now the whole world has to recognize
[2:24:00] that he's alive again.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; He was not only the mechanics, God's
[2:24:06] word. Oh, but he was the dynamics to
[2:24:09] prove it.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; There's a reason why he preached this
[2:24:14] message, brothers and sisters. Not to
[2:24:16] look back and say, "What a wonderful
[2:24:17] Easter it was 2,000 years ago." Well, he
[2:24:19] says at the beginning of that message
[2:24:21] that he wants to see us recognize 2,000
[2:24:24] years later the resurrection of Jesus
[2:24:26] Christ.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; What we're preaching this morning, he
[2:24:29] has got to be alive and well in our
[2:24:31] lives today. He goes on to say, "And as
[2:24:33] he being the groom, the bride has to
[2:24:35] come forth because it's part of him. And
[2:24:37] it can only be the manifestation of the
[2:24:39] fulfilling of all the revelations any
[2:24:42] others has spoke of the bride. It can
[2:24:45] only manifest. If it does something
[2:24:47] different from the groom,
[2:24:50] it isn't the bride.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; If it does something different than the
[2:24:54] groom, it isn't the bride.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; And I want to say it this way. If it
[2:24:59] does something different than the
[2:25:01] prophetic utterance, it isn't the bride.
[2:25:04] If it does something different than the
[2:25:06] way the prophet taught it, it isn't the
[2:25:09] bride. That's right. Amen.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; It isn't the bride because she is flesh
[2:25:14] of his flesh, bone of his bone, life of
[2:25:17] his life, power of his power.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; She is him.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; Woo. I think that's so beautiful. That's
[2:25:23] where I live, brothers and sisters. She
[2:25:25] is him. This is the second coming of the
[2:25:28] Lord Jesus Christ. The manifestation of
[2:25:30] the angel messenger's word in the virgin
[2:25:33] womb causes the life of Jesus Christ to
[2:25:36] come forth in every single person which
[2:25:39] makes up this bride body.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; My she is his flesh of his flesh, bone
[2:25:44] of his bone, life of his life, power of
[2:25:46] his power. She is him as man and woman
[2:25:49] are one and woman taken from his side.
[2:25:51] She had taken a spirit, a feminist
[2:25:53] spirit from him, the flesh from his
[2:25:55] side, made both mechanics and dynamics.
[2:25:59] the wife, the spirit of him and the
[2:26:01] flesh of him and put it together and
[2:26:04] made mechanics and dynamics
[2:26:09] until the church of the people, all
[2:26:11] these Easter bunnies and ceremonies and
[2:26:13] big churches and finery will fail and
[2:26:15] pass away
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; until that church becomes both dynamics
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; and mechanics.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; I say let those dynamics fall on the
[2:26:26] mechanics. Amen.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; But how is that ever going to happen if
[2:26:29] we don't get together when the church
[2:26:32] opens its doors?
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; If we want to see more of God, maybe we
[2:26:38] ought to give a little more.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; And if there's a deep calling, brothers
[2:26:42] and sisters, there is a deep to respond.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful. I was looking at it.
[2:26:47] The city of Calgary has exceeded 1.6
[2:26:50] million people. Now, where's the last
[2:26:53] predestinated seed?
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. How are we going to find that one?
[2:26:57] Where are we going? What are we doing?
[2:27:00] I think we're on the on the edge of
[2:27:02] something big going down in this world.
[2:27:04] And I really want to do our part here in
[2:27:06] the city of Calgary to find that last
[2:27:08] predestinated seed. My
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; If you have a need this morning, I just
[2:27:13] want to invite you to make it known unto
[2:27:15] him by way of an uplift hand as we bow
[2:27:17] our heads and and close the service
[2:27:19] here.
[2:27:21] Maybe there's something in our life that
[2:27:24] just hasn't been going right and we just
[2:27:27] don't understand and we just need the
[2:27:29] Lord to reveal it to us.
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; If we just raise our hand while all of
[2:27:35] our eyes are closed and our heads are
[2:27:37] bowed and just trust him that he's
[2:27:40] watching and he knows our hearts.
[2:27:43] He's more than able.
[2:27:46] My eyes are closed, too. I don't want to
[2:27:47] see. I don't need to see. because it's
[2:27:51] not me that we're going to bring these
[2:27:52] needs to.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, this morning you see
[2:27:56] the hands,
[2:27:58] Lord Jesus. You see the needs in the
[2:28:00] hearts of your children.
[2:28:03] And Father, Lord, I just can't help but
[2:28:05] think of the the desire in their hearts,
[2:28:08] Lord, to raise their hands to you to say
[2:28:10] that there's more that I need of you.
[2:28:14] We know that you said through your
[2:28:15] prophet where there is a deep calling,
[2:28:17] there has to be a deep to respond. Where
[2:28:19] there's a scriptural question, there is
[2:28:21] a scriptural answer. Where there's a
[2:28:23] need in our life, you have a solution
[2:28:25] for us already.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to ask that you
[2:28:29] would allow the dynamic power of the
[2:28:31] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ come upon
[2:28:34] your church.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; In a way like maybe we've never
[2:28:37] experienced before. Myself, too. Lord,
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; help us to get out of the way and and
[2:28:42] hail King Jesus. Help us to just make
[2:28:46] the way for you, Lord, to manifest in
[2:28:49] our lives.
[2:28:51] What good is it to polish the church?
[2:28:54] What good is it to polish the hubs? What
[2:28:56] good is it to do any of that, Lord, if
[2:28:58] we don't have the dynamic spark in our
[2:29:01] lives of your Holy Spirit?
[2:29:03] Father, we just cast down every
[2:29:05] imagination that would try and exalt
[2:29:07] itself against your word now in the name
[2:29:09] of Jesus Christ. And we invite you,
[2:29:11] Lord, to take your position in the
[2:29:13] throne rooms of our hearts.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; We give you the preeminence, Lord. We
[2:29:18] thank you for your word. Thank you,
[2:29:20] Lord, that you rolled away that stone,
[2:29:22] Father. That you shook that dead body
[2:29:24] back to life with your spirit and that
[2:29:26] you stepped out and said, "I am he. I
[2:29:29] declare, oh, Father, the resurrected
[2:29:32] life of Jesus Christ back on this earth
[2:29:34] again.
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; Help us to receive it the way that
[2:29:38] you've given it. Lord, help us not to
[2:29:40] make excuses for it, Lord, and say that
[2:29:42] we just believe that it should be
[2:29:44] another way, so that's the way it's
[2:29:45] going to be. Oh, Father, forgive us for
[2:29:48] all of our shortcomings. Help us to
[2:29:50] receive that that one sacrifice that you
[2:29:52] made for every one of us, Lord.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; Help us to receive it the way that
[2:29:57] you've given it. And Lord Jesus, we'll
[2:29:59] be careful to give you praise. Lord
[2:30:01] Jesus, we love you and we thank you. And
[2:30:03] Lord, we just pray that you would keep
[2:30:05] your hand upon each one of us now as we
[2:30:06] go our separate ways. Bless those who
[2:30:08] couldn't come today, Father, wherever
[2:30:10] they are. Thank you, Father, for
[2:30:12] touching those lives, keeping your
[2:30:14] angels encamped about those who fear
[2:30:16] you, even in the midst of of maybe armed
[2:30:18] gunmen, bad guys that would think that
[2:30:20] they have power over your children. Oh,
[2:30:23] Father, we thank you that your angels
[2:30:25] are encamped about those who fear you.
[2:30:27] Oh, Father, we know that there's way
[2:30:29] more for them than there are against
[2:30:31] them.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, even now if they're still in
[2:30:34] bondage, we pray that you would just
[2:30:36] bring them comfort, Lord.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, maybe they could be just
[2:30:39] like Paul and Silas while they were in
[2:30:41] prison that night, Father.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. And in their afflictions, in
[2:30:45] their pain, they began to worship. And
[2:30:47] in the midst of the worship, Father, it
[2:30:49] shook the foundations of that building,
[2:30:51] of that prison. And open the doors,
[2:30:53] Lord, and loose the chains. Father, we
[2:30:56] pray that you would just send them
[2:30:57] encouragement, Lord Jesus, even now in
[2:31:00] the name of Jesus.
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, we look forward to the
[2:31:04] testimony. We'll be careful to give you
[2:31:06] praise. We commit each and every one of
[2:31:08] the other prayer requests unto you as
[2:31:10] well. Father, keep your hand upon us as
[2:31:12] we go our separate ways.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; We're so thankful that you call us your
[2:31:16] sons and your daughters.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; We love you and we thank you. We ask all
[2:31:20] these things now. In Jesus Christ's name
[2:31:22] we pray.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:25] Amen. Can we sing that song? I bless
[2:31:27] your name. I bless your name
[2:31:33] [Music]
[2:31:37] in prisoners chains
[2:31:41] with bleeding stripes.
[2:31:46] All silence
[2:31:50] prayed that night.
[2:31:54] And in their pain
[2:31:58] began to see
[2:32:02] [Music]
