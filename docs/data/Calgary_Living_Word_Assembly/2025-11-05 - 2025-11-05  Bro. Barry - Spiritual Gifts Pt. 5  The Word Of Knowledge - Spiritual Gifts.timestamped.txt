[17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:38] Can I ask uh brother Peter said if you
[17:41] could open the service in prayer? It
[17:42] sounds funny.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. Let us pray.
[17:59] Our most precious heavenly father,
[18:04] what an honor and a privilege given to
[18:06] us to assemble here this evening,
[18:09] Wednesday evening, having a place to go
[18:12] to recharge our energies, Lord. Father,
[18:16] this evening we've come
[18:19] to charge our batteries. Sometimes
[18:22] father we go through the week with many
[18:25] many many troubles with many many
[18:28] situations.
[18:30] Sometimes even with doubt if we are
[18:33] believers
[18:34] but
[18:36] we have a hope in you. Father when we
[18:39] meet like this
[18:41] we [music] come to bring
[18:44] those questions that we could not have
[18:46] answers that the devil throws at us. We
[18:50] have a place to come
[18:53] &gt;&gt; and you always meet us. You always come
[18:56] on the scene to answer them for us.
[18:59] Lord, when we see our brothers and our
[19:01] sisters, we have hope and we believe
[19:05] that each and everyone has the same
[19:07] testimony.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; The devil is not happy to see us
[19:13] going about
[19:16] our duty. So he always comes around and
[19:20] throw things that we don't need in our
[19:22] lives. As we come here this evening,
[19:25] Father,
[19:27] it is my prayer
[19:29] that you move from person to person this
[19:32] evening. And those questions that are
[19:34] lingering, you'll provide answer.
[19:39] Whatever forms, but I believe that the
[19:42] word that is about to come, there is an
[19:45] answer in it. Amen.
[19:46] &gt;&gt; May you have a place in our hearts. May
[19:49] you have a place for us to receive that
[19:52] word that is about to come. I want to
[19:54] thank you Lord for each and every person
[19:57] that is represented here this evening.
[19:59] Lord
[19:59] &gt;&gt; Lord
[20:00] &gt;&gt; they came from various homes. They came
[20:04] through
[20:06] whatever situation.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord
[20:09] &gt;&gt; they are here Lord to feed upon the
[20:11] word. May you move from person to
[20:13] person, from pew to pew, that by the
[20:16] time we get home, we have answers to the
[20:19] questions that we have,
[20:21] &gt;&gt; Lord. And I pray for my son as lead he's
[20:24] leading songs this evening that you help
[20:26] him, Lord. Calm his nerves, Lord, so
[20:30] that he can bring songs of Zion to your
[20:32] people
[20:33] &gt;&gt; as we prepare to receive your word.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Once again, our pastor has labored
[20:39] &gt;&gt; throughout the whole week to bring your
[20:40] mind
[20:42] May we catch whatever the Lord you have
[20:46] prepared for us. Lord, we shall be
[20:48] careful to give you thanks. Once again,
[20:50] we commit the service from the beginning
[20:52] to the end. May you bless it for in
[20:56] Jesus name that we pray.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[36:56] God bless you tonight. Welcome to the
[36:58] house of the Lord on a Wednesday midweek
[37:01] service
[37:03] for a little spiritual recharge.
[37:06] We just have uh one two prayer requests
[37:09] we'd like to bring
[37:11] tonight. But first, we have one praise
[37:14] report and that is for brother Peter
[37:16] Hoffer, brother Peter Hoffer's dad to go
[37:19] home
[37:20] &gt;&gt; when the doctors said there was no hope.
[37:23] I think that's literally what they said
[37:25] and I believe today he went home.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Certainly thank the Lord for that.
[37:29] [applause]
[37:34] [applause]
[37:36] continue to hold the family in prayer
[37:37] and just trust the Lord will continue to
[37:40] [music] have his will
[37:42] &gt;&gt; in their life to in in the future here.
[37:46] We also [music] want to remember brother
[37:49] Samuel Eggmana. He needs a touch from
[37:51] the Lord
[37:53] and uh we have an unspoken request
[37:56] tonight. If you have a need tonight,
[37:58] maybe just defy gravity and make it
[38:00] known unto him as we go to him in
[38:03] prayer.
[38:04] Gracious heavenly father, we just thank
[38:06] you for this another opportunity, Lord,
[38:08] to gather together in your name.
[38:11] Father, we don't know how many more
[38:13] times we will have like this on this
[38:15] side of eternity.
[38:17] We know that any day anything could
[38:20] change. Father,
[38:22] you could decide that our time is
[38:24] complete here on earth and call us home.
[38:27] Father, we could see the loved ones that
[38:30] have gone on before us, and we could see
[38:33] a body change in in a moment, in the
[38:35] twinkling of an eye, according to your
[38:37] word. We don't know what tomorrow has in
[38:40] store, but we know that you have it all
[38:43] in your control. It's all in your hand,
[38:46] Lord. And we thank you for that. In this
[38:49] world of uncertainty, Father, there's
[38:51] only one thing that is certain, and
[38:53] that's you.
[38:54] And father, we just ask that we could
[38:56] find ourselves to be found in you,
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. There's no other place.
[39:02] There's no other hiding place in this
[39:04] world.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Unto who could we go?
[39:07] &gt;&gt; And Father, tonight we just thank you
[39:09] for the praise report for Brother Peter
[39:12] Hoffer, that he would be able to go back
[39:14] home and be with his family, Lord, and
[39:16] to be able to communicate with them
[39:19] after the doctor said there's no hope.
[39:22] that clinically he's brain dead,
[39:25] but we know that the family believes
[39:28] that you are a living God.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; And Father, we give you all the praise
[39:33] and all the glory.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; We thank you tonight, Father. And Lord
[39:38] Jesus, tonight we just want to remember
[39:40] the unspoken request. Father,
[39:42] &gt;&gt; you know the circumstance and the
[39:44] situation and we trust you, Father, that
[39:47] you have it in your complete control.
[39:50] And we'll be careful to give you the
[39:52] praise, Lord, when the time comes that
[39:54] you answer it. Lord,
[39:55] &gt;&gt; and Father, we just want to remember
[39:57] brother Samuel Eggman
[40:00] is suffering from bleeding noses and the
[40:02] doctors don't know why.
[40:04] Father, we know that brother Jerry
[40:06] Carpenter [music]
[40:07] had the same thing.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; And Father, we just thank you, Lord,
[40:11] that you are the great physician
[40:14] &gt;&gt; and your specialty is when the doctors
[40:17] don't know.
[40:19] We just commit our brothers into your
[40:21] hands, Father. That you would just touch
[40:22] them in the name of Jesus. That they
[40:25] would come and give a praise report as
[40:27] well.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Now, Father, we just ask that you would
[40:30] bless each one who's made the effort to
[40:31] come out, Lord, who's Lord, brought a
[40:34] request in their heart. Lord, we've
[40:36] come, we've gathered together in your
[40:38] name because we have needs in our lives.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; And Father, we know that many times the
[40:43] needs are so complicated. There's no
[40:46] human there's no way humanly that we
[40:48] could ever see a way for it to be fixed.
[40:52] But Lord Jesus, we know that there's
[40:54] nothing too great for you.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; So we just commit each need into your
[40:58] hands now for your glory, Father. Each
[41:01] one that raised their hand tonight,
[41:02] Lord, we thank you for them. We thank
[41:04] you for their desire, Lord, to bring
[41:06] their needs unto you according to your
[41:08] word, which is your will. Now, we just
[41:11] ask, Father, that you would bless each
[41:13] one as we change the order of the
[41:16] service now and turn to your word. We
[41:17] [music] just ask that you would be
[41:19] glorified.
[41:20] We ask all these things now in Jesus
[41:22] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God
[41:26] bless you. Musicians, thank you so much.
[41:29] Once again, if you have your Bibles, I'd
[41:31] like to continue on in 1 Corinthians
[41:34] chapter 12,
[41:36] speaking about spiritual gifts.
[41:44] 1 Corinthians chapter 12.
[41:53] I love how the Lord spoke to us through
[41:58] this word through the prophet Paul.
[42:02] Chapter 12 verse one. Now concerning
[42:04] spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not
[42:07] have you ignorant.
[42:10] Ye know that ye were Gentiles carried
[42:13] away unto these dumb idols, even as ye
[42:16] were led.
[42:18] Wherefore I give you to understand that
[42:20] no man speaking by the Spirit of God
[42:22] calleth Jesus a cursed, and that no man
[42:25] can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by
[42:29] the Holy Ghost. Aren't you thankful for
[42:31] that tonight?
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now there are diversities of gifts
[42:36] but the same spirit.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; And there are differences of
[42:39] administrations but the same Lord and
[42:43] there are diversities of operations but
[42:46] it is the same God which workketh all in
[42:49] all. But the manifestation of the spirit
[42:52] is given to every man to profit with
[42:56] all. That's so wonderful.
[42:59] For to one is given by the spirit the
[43:02] word of wisdom, to another the word of
[43:05] knowledge by the same Spirit, to another
[43:08] faith by the same Spirit. To another
[43:11] gifts of healing by the same Spirit. To
[43:15] another the working of miracles, to
[43:17] another prophecy, to another discerning
[43:20] of spirits, to another diverse kinds of
[43:24] tongues, to another the interpretation
[43:26] of tongues. But all these workketh that
[43:29] one, and the self-samed spirit, dividing
[43:31] to every man severally as he will. For
[43:36] as the body is one, and hath many
[43:38] members, and all the members of that one
[43:41] body, being many, are one body, so also
[43:45] is Christ. For by one spirit, we are all
[43:50] baptized into one body. Whether we be
[43:53] Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or
[43:57] free, and have been all made to drink
[44:00] into one spirit.
[44:03] Let's just bow in prayer.
[44:06] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful that
[44:08] you have given your spirit, Lord Jesus.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; You've given it freely, Lord, for all of
[44:14] us to profit with all. And we know that
[44:17] it's not for a financial gain, Lord.
[44:20] It's so that we could actually
[44:22] hear your word and receive it into our
[44:25] heart and get revelation from it. Lord
[44:29] Jesus,
[44:30] &gt;&gt; that's the prophet we're talking about.
[44:32] We thank you for that, Lord. And we pray
[44:34] that you would just, oh Lord Jesus, let
[44:37] the windows of heaven open again
[44:39] tonight, Lord, and just pour yourself
[44:41] out to us, Lord, so that we could, Lord,
[44:44] receive a blessing that we just can't
[44:46] even contain, Father, according to your
[44:49] word, Lord Jesus, we ask. In Jesus
[44:52] Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless
[44:54] you tonight. You may be seated.
[44:58] I uh had the pleasure of
[45:03] getting up early today and I do it
[45:05] pretty much every day, but just getting
[45:07] on the on the uh Bible study and just
[45:11] had some some thoughts I thought were
[45:14] were pretty interesting. You know, I
[45:16] just I went into the day today thinking
[45:19] about it. You know, when the time comes
[45:21] for us to be over there on the other
[45:23] side, I I believe we will have a
[45:25] consciousness of this earth.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; We will be conscious of our lives that
[45:31] we lived here. And uh and I just I just
[45:34] got thinking about this and you know I
[45:37] don't know if if I kind of doubt we will
[45:40] have like a photo album but we might
[45:42] have the the memories and and probably
[45:46] all of them because we'll be in a a
[45:48] perfect body at that point.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; But we'll be able to recall all of the
[45:52] situations in our lives. And you know
[45:55] what really hit me this morning was that
[45:57] we're not going to actually have things
[46:00] there from here, are we? The only thing
[46:04] that we're going to have are the
[46:06] memories of the things that we actually
[46:09] did here. A and even more so, the only
[46:12] thing that we're going to have
[46:14] are the memories of the decisions that
[46:16] we made. I know I jumped the gun,
[46:19] brother. Thank you. Um, I've got
[46:21] announcements I'm going to get into, but
[46:23] I just wanted to bring this thought
[46:24] about how the only thing that we're
[46:27] really going to have over there to
[46:28] remember are the decisions that we made
[46:30] here and how vital and how important
[46:33] every single decision that we make here
[46:36] actually is because that's what's
[46:38] shaping our character and that's the
[46:40] only thing that we get to take with us.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; We don't get to take our investments. We
[46:44] don't get to take any of our insurance
[46:47] payments. We don't get to take our
[46:49] houses, our cars, any of our jewelry.
[46:52] There's nothing that we're going to take
[46:54] from this world
[46:55] &gt;&gt; except for the decisions that we make.
[46:59] And so when we zoom out and think about
[47:02] it, as we look back on our lives from
[47:05] that position, what will it be like to
[47:08] consider that one decision that we made
[47:12] from that time I decided to accept that
[47:17] William Mariam Brham was the infallible
[47:20] prophet to the age. And from that time,
[47:24] I accepted all that he said, whether I
[47:27] believed it or understood it or or any
[47:30] of it. I just accepted it and said amen
[47:32] to that word.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; And you know, I just I just about had a
[47:36] little jubilee. I would have woke
[47:37] everyone up if I started shouting. But
[47:39] just to think about that, what that
[47:42] means, because only the people that
[47:44] actually get to that place, that make
[47:46] that decision, are going to be the ones
[47:48] looking back saying, "Praise the Lord. I
[47:50] actually made that decision. That is
[47:52] what put me here. That's what caused me
[47:54] to go in the rapture. Anyone who chooses
[47:57] to hybridize the message of the hour
[47:59] with any one of their thoughts is
[48:01] actually not going to make it in the
[48:04] rapture. And I know that's a piercing
[48:06] thought. It's actually a searing word to
[48:09] hear to our lives. But, you know, we
[48:12] either believe or we don't. And and
[48:14] looking back, I just think it's going to
[48:15] be so wonderful to say it because if
[48:17] we're able to believe it, it's not
[48:19] something that we could just choose to
[48:20] do either. Just for the record, it's a
[48:22] gift that God has given us before the
[48:25] foundation of the world. Amen.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Chosen in him so that we would be able
[48:29] to receive it. I was on another call and
[48:31] I was I was talking about it and I just
[48:32] was was thinking, you know, a scenario
[48:35] might be like John the prophet, the the
[48:37] the the guy that was on the aisle of
[48:40] Patmas for the testimony of Jesus
[48:42] Christ. He actually maybe he was like
[48:45] the the the all-star quarterback and and
[48:47] he had the word for his age. And what
[48:50] did he do? He actually threw a long bomb
[48:53] down through eternity so that someone
[48:56] would be there in every single age to
[48:59] catch that word and then another
[49:01] quarterback would catch it and and then
[49:03] throw it further and it just would
[49:05] continue to go leaprogging down
[49:07] throughout the ages to this age. Brother
[49:11] Brham, taking that word,
[49:14] &gt;&gt; actually receiving that word, being like
[49:16] the wide receiver in the end zone, the
[49:19] end of time, being able to catch that
[49:21] word a and be able to actually bring it
[49:24] to the people and properly show it to
[49:26] them because we know the word only comes
[49:28] to the prophet.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; It doesn't come to the seminary.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; It doesn't come to the theologians.
[49:37] Doesn't come to the pope.
[49:39] doesn't even come to the pastor. It
[49:41] comes to the prophet.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; That's the word of God.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; And it's important to just make sure
[49:46] that the pastor is saying what the
[49:48] prophet said.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[49:49] &gt;&gt; That's the critical factor. But I just
[49:51] was thinking about this. What a what a
[49:53] what a tremendous thing this will be. It
[49:55] it it this is that which will break make
[49:58] and bring to pass their victory. He says
[50:03] in the love divine
[50:05] charity, the Holy Ghost as we read about
[50:07] that's given to everyone to profit with
[50:09] all.
[50:11] I just thought about that today and it
[50:13] just just made me pretty excited.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Just wanted to remind everyone we got
[50:19] the the regular prayer meeting first uh
[50:22] Thursday of the month. Tomorrow at 7:30
[50:25] Saturday the 22nd we have Sister
[50:27] Germaine's funeral and uh it's going to
[50:30] be a busy day. We have her funeral on
[50:32] the 22nd at 10:00 a.m. There is the
[50:35] That's the funeral service. Then we have
[50:36] the burial. I believe it's at the same
[50:39] cemetery where the the funeral service
[50:41] will be held. That will be at 1:00 p.m.
[50:43] And there will be a reception at 2 p.m.
[50:46] And then we actually have service at
[50:47] 6:00 p.m. with Brother Cadre Diggs. And
[50:50] then uh we'll have service on the Sunday
[50:53] the next day. We have the youth event
[50:55] scheduled for Sunday the 23rd and we
[50:58] have a youth service for Friday the 28th
[51:01] and uh certainly excited to see what the
[51:03] Lord will do there again. We had a
[51:06] tremendous youth service on uh on Friday
[51:09] last week and just just really neat to
[51:11] see the Lord move in the the lives of
[51:14] the youth. Certainly excited to see what
[51:17] will happen there. you know, um, talking
[51:21] about our scripture tonight, I wanted
[51:23] to, uh, pick up from where we left off
[51:25] last week. We talked about the word of
[51:28] wisdom, uh, out of verse eight. For
[51:30] there is, for to one is given by the
[51:34] spirit, the word of wisdom, to another,
[51:37] the word of knowledge by the same
[51:40] spirit. So, we talked a little bit about
[51:42] wisdom last week, and I want to talk
[51:44] about knowledge this week. and uh by the
[51:47] grace of God, we'll maybe be able to
[51:50] just just talk about a little bit and
[51:52] see what the Lord will do. You know, uh
[51:55] wisdom and knowledge, as I'm sure we
[51:57] know, kind of go together. And I don't
[52:00] think it's an accident that they're both
[52:02] together in verse eight here because,
[52:05] you know, when you have wisdom, you can
[52:07] actually have knowledge. And uh they're
[52:10] not exactly the same. I'm not going to
[52:12] get into the the perfect definitions of
[52:15] them tonight. I'm going to look at it
[52:16] from more of a spiritual aspect,
[52:19] &gt;&gt; but I believe that uh there is a little
[52:21] bit of a a comparison that we can do
[52:23] that will actually maybe help explain it
[52:26] just a little bit. And you know, it's
[52:28] kind of according to the word of God.
[52:30] And and I believe that wisdom, the word
[52:32] of wisdom, it it speaks to revelation
[52:35] and understanding. When we have
[52:38] revelation in our lives about the word
[52:40] of God, we have a supernatural wisdom
[52:43] about the word of God. And it's not just
[52:46] knowledge. [clears throat] Just
[52:48] knowledge is actually reading and and
[52:50] maybe comprehending and having a
[52:52] conversation. But it takes the wisdom of
[52:55] the spirit to actually create a
[52:58] revelation that will take that word from
[53:00] our mind all the way down into our
[53:02] heart. Because as a man thinkketh in his
[53:06] heart, so is he.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; And we know that hearts, how can a heart
[53:10] think? Brother Brandham talks about
[53:12] that. It's kind of a strange thing if
[53:14] you want to get scientific about it
[53:15] because hearts don't have brains, do
[53:17] they? They have souls. There's just a
[53:20] tiny little spot inside them. But
[53:22] wisdom, it speaks a little bit to
[53:23] revelation and understanding. And
[53:24] knowledge, I think, speaks to
[53:26] experience. I just wanted to bring it
[53:28] that way because when we have revelation
[53:30] and understanding, then we can take it
[53:32] and apply it in our lives. And when we
[53:34] do that, we actually demonstrate that we
[53:36] have experience. Now I I think it's a
[53:39] beautiful thing because when we look at
[53:40] the elders who actually are able to
[53:43] bring a good report of this word, what
[53:46] does the the wisdom in their lives do
[53:50] about this word? Does it give them an
[53:53] opportunity to have a solid word-based
[53:55] experience that they demonstrate to the
[53:57] brothers and sisters around them and
[53:59] their children and even the
[54:01] congregation? Does does it actually give
[54:04] them that or does something else take
[54:06] place? Because I want to say tonight if
[54:08] something else is taking place then I
[54:10] I'll I'll guarantee you it is not
[54:12] according to the word of God. It's not a
[54:14] word of wisdom according to the word of
[54:16] God that gives people head knowledge.
[54:19] head knowledge is simply coming and
[54:22] understanding and and I think it's a
[54:23] part a bit of a part of uh maybe having
[54:26] a bit of a religion a religious
[54:28] experience instead of actually having a
[54:31] relationship with the king of kings and
[54:33] lord of lords where he becomes lord and
[54:35] as we read in the scripture tonight
[54:37] nobody nobody no human being sorry about
[54:40] that no human being actually calls him
[54:44] lord without the holy ghost in their
[54:46] life
[54:47] &gt;&gt; and and I'll say this I think it's very
[54:49] important to say it you know people will
[54:51] say it people will say oh he's my lord
[54:53] he's my lord oh yes he's my lord but
[54:55] they won't live it
[54:57] &gt;&gt; so what it is is a p impersonation of
[55:00] Christianity
[55:01] &gt;&gt; and and and I got into this on the call
[55:03] this morning you know there's if you
[55:04] could just visualize maybe a wall a wall
[55:07] like this and and it's divided up into
[55:09] cubicles cubicles cubicles the whole
[55:11] wall is just different cubicles you
[55:13] could probably take a wall bigger than
[55:14] that and make a whole bunch of cubicles
[55:16] and each one would fit a different
[55:18] description of Christianity. What is
[55:21] Christianity? Christianity is being
[55:24] Christlike, isn't it?
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Right?
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Christlike. And we know that Catholicism
[55:29] would probably trump everyone because
[55:31] they claim to be Christians.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; The Catholics do very much so. They
[55:35] claim to be the first Christians. In
[55:37] fact, that word Catholic means
[55:39] universal. So, they would cover all of
[55:41] the boxes, right? But which one of those
[55:43] boxes would would we be? Which one would
[55:46] we be? I I don't know where it would
[55:48] fit. The only one that would fit would
[55:51] actually be those who actually call him
[55:54] Lord. And the only way you can call him
[55:56] Lord is to live it.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; That's what the word's talking about.
[56:00] It's not saying I call him Lord. Lord,
[56:02] you're Lord of my life. And and and then
[56:04] I go and just live my life or I I just
[56:06] conduct myself in a way that's actually
[56:08] contrary to the word of God. It doesn't
[56:12] work. It creates a mixed signal. out of
[56:15] 1955 where I think Pentecost failed.
[56:18] Brother Brandham, he says, "And
[56:19] therefore, when people claim to be
[56:21] Christians or impersonate Christianity
[56:25] or try to act like they're a Christian,
[56:29] when down in their heart they don't have
[56:32] the peace of God,
[56:35] you only become an actor."
[56:38] Brothers and sisters, that's why I
[56:39] preach continually. We've got to have
[56:41] the Holy Ghost in our life. And I'm not
[56:44] saying that tonight we got to have the
[56:46] Holy Ghost so that we can see gifts in
[56:47] our lives. We've got to have the Holy
[56:49] Ghost in our lives so that we know we're
[56:50] sealed, so that we know exactly where we
[56:52] stand with the Lord. The Holy Ghost is
[56:55] going to be the one that leads us and
[56:56] guides us into all truth. And what's all
[56:58] truth? I'll say it this way. For our
[57:01] day, the cubicle would be the message of
[57:03] the hour, wherever that is on the wall.
[57:06] And outside of that cubicle on on on the
[57:08] wall with Christianity as a whole, that
[57:12] that cubicle with the message of the
[57:14] hour, outside of that, we're actually
[57:16] not calling him Lord.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; We desire to call him Lord. Many people
[57:21] claim Jesus. Many people claim the
[57:23] blood, but nobody is actually falling
[57:26] under the token for this age outside of
[57:29] this message of the hour.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; That's just the way it is. That's God's
[57:33] program. That's not our program. We
[57:34] never designed it that way. Some people
[57:36] think that William Brham created a cult
[57:39] and a whole bunch of people they came
[57:40] along and and got sucked into it and
[57:43] everybody follows a man. We know that we
[57:44] don't follow cunningly devised fables.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; We follow the word of God that was given
[57:49] and laid out by God through Paul
[57:52] &gt;&gt; and then passed down through all of the
[57:53] ages.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; But some people, they just don't go all
[57:57] the way and get into Christ. And and the
[57:59] reason we're saying this is because it's
[58:01] true. Some people come all the way up to
[58:04] that promised land, the Jordan River,
[58:06] the time to die out to themselves and
[58:08] actually cross over into the promised
[58:10] land so that they can become adopted.
[58:12] But they just don't want to cross over.
[58:14] They're just pretty happy on this side
[58:15] of the land.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; But they see all the blessings of the
[58:19] Lord in their lives. They can come to
[58:21] church and experience wonderful church
[58:23] services, the power and manifestation of
[58:26] the Holy Ghost in other people's lives.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah,
[58:31] &gt;&gt; but maybe miss out on their own. Unless
[58:34] we actually go all the way into the
[58:35] promised land, we can't be positionally
[58:37] placed in the land. And just being over
[58:40] in the promised land does not mean we
[58:42] are positionally placed in the land
[58:44] because adoption is that final step of
[58:47] being positionally placed in our
[58:49] inheritance.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; And it takes wisdom and it takes
[58:54] knowledge. It takes revelation by the
[58:56] word, by the spirit to the word. It
[58:59] takes that revelation, that wisdom to
[59:02] give us knowledge on how to conduct
[59:04] ourselves to fight the enemy because
[59:07] he's not going to give an inch. We're
[59:09] going to have to fight for every single
[59:10] inch of land in our inheritance. That's
[59:13] what the prophet said. Let's go back to
[59:15] the quote here. And therefore,
[59:17] when people claim to be Christians or
[59:19] impersonate Christianity or try to act
[59:21] like they're a Christian when down in
[59:23] their heart they don't have the peace of
[59:26] God, you only become an actor.
[59:29] And you know, people really know that.
[59:32] People can see it. People are wise. Our
[59:35] our our our actions betray us. Your
[59:39] neighbor knows that you're just acting
[59:41] that way. Certainly. She see you just
[59:43] get mad and fly loose and beat the dog
[59:45] around the house and holler at your
[59:47] husband and scat him under the bed when
[59:50] he comes in and you do the same to wife.
[59:53] They know that's not Christianity
[59:56] &gt;&gt; acting. Certainly I say Lord help us.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Now don't get me wrong we all have
[1:00:03] humanity. We all definitely have
[1:00:06] humanity. But brother Brandham says
[1:00:08] something here. When you really get
[1:00:10] saved, he changes you.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; So I want to say tonight, if we're still
[1:00:14] the same old man, if that same old man
[1:00:16] is still alive in our lives, have we
[1:00:19] died out?
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; And and I'll say it this way because I
[1:00:22] know what it's like. The old man doesn't
[1:00:24] want to die. The old man is going to be
[1:00:27] around. You know, we have the thorn in
[1:00:29] our flesh. Our flesh is that thorn. We
[1:00:32] got to remember that. We're going to
[1:00:33] fight that guy. But is it easier or
[1:00:36] better now than it was before? Because
[1:00:38] it should be. Is it different now than
[1:00:40] it was before? Because it should be. If
[1:00:43] it's the same as it was before, then
[1:00:45] we've missed something.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; There's something missing. And tonight,
[1:00:48] I want to encourage us to find that
[1:00:50] missing thing.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; We don't have to carry on acting.
[1:00:55] He said, "When you really get saved, he
[1:00:56] changes you. You don't have to act. You
[1:00:58] just act natural."
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; The way you are here is the way you are
[1:01:02] there.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; When you're up, you're up. When you're
[1:01:05] down, you're down. You're still the same
[1:01:06] person.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; I just love that you're just yourself.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; But God forsaw and placed and set
[1:01:15] certain things to happen.
[1:01:18] Therefore, he could take the prophets
[1:01:19] with the gift of knowledge and foreshow
[1:01:21] them what was going to be. and they
[1:01:24] could speak it because it's a word of
[1:01:26] knowledge that God gives to his prophet.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; As I was studying this, I thought, man,
[1:01:33] that's so good because I don't really
[1:01:35] think that I need to worry too much
[1:01:37] about having this this knowledge in the
[1:01:41] word of God here because he'll give me
[1:01:43] the knowledge that I need.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. If I am able to call him Lord by
[1:01:47] living my life according to that that
[1:01:49] that statement and and letting his
[1:01:52] spirit reveal to me the the deep things,
[1:01:55] yay, the hidden things, the mysterious
[1:01:58] things. If I am able to allow him to do
[1:02:02] that, then you know what? This this
[1:02:04] message of the hour is going to actually
[1:02:06] bring this whole thing to life for us.
[1:02:10] But it takes the Lord to do it. It takes
[1:02:12] his knowledge to do it for us. Amen.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; So, tonight we're talking about the the
[1:02:17] word of knowledge and uh how wisdom
[1:02:20] basically goes together with knowledge
[1:02:23] and and it's revelation and
[1:02:24] understanding uh wisdom and and
[1:02:26] knowledge I think speaks to experience.
[1:02:28] As I said, I could be wrong with that.
[1:02:30] Somebody might want to discuss it and
[1:02:32] and say that's not right. But that's
[1:02:34] okay. I'm open to discussion. I think
[1:02:36] there's nothing better to talk about, is
[1:02:37] there, than the word of God. But we're
[1:02:39] not supposed to come together and be
[1:02:41] contentious.
[1:02:43] You know, in Romans chapter 5, if you
[1:02:45] want to turn over there tonight, Romans
[1:02:47] chapter 5,
[1:02:50] got a few scriptures that will bring,
[1:02:55] Lord willing.
[1:02:58] Romans 5:1 says, "Therefore being
[1:03:02] justified by faith, we have peace with
[1:03:04] God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:03:08] by whom also we have access by faith
[1:03:12] into this grace, wherein we stand and
[1:03:17] rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
[1:03:21] And not only so, but we glory in
[1:03:24] tribulations also,
[1:03:26] knowing that tribulation workketh
[1:03:29] patience.
[1:03:31] And we know that patience is part of the
[1:03:34] virtues, isn't it? In the stature of the
[1:03:36] perfect man. Unfortunately, it is. And
[1:03:40] patience experience and experience hope.
[1:03:44] and hope maketh not ashamed because the
[1:03:47] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[1:03:49] by the Holy Ghost which is given unto
[1:03:52] us.
[1:03:53] I just think this scripture is so good
[1:03:55] because it talks it speaks about how
[1:03:58] tribulations are what's going to bring
[1:04:01] forward this experience in our life.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Talking about our scripture
[1:04:06] tonight, as I mentioned, the word of of
[1:04:11] knowledge is a bit about experience and
[1:04:14] and taking the wisdom through revelation
[1:04:17] that we've got about this word and being
[1:04:19] able to overcome in our everyday lives
[1:04:22] and being able to overcome in our
[1:04:25] marriages and to overcome with our
[1:04:27] families and maybe at work and maybe at
[1:04:30] school all of the situations that we
[1:04:33] have to go through. And it can be as
[1:04:35] simple as the revelation that, you know,
[1:04:37] that's that's that actually pertains to
[1:04:39] me. You know, maybe my spouse actually
[1:04:42] I'm not saying that my spouse does, but
[1:04:44] I'm just going to say it. For example,
[1:04:45] maybe my spouse just continually says
[1:04:48] nasty things to me. Continually says
[1:04:51] nasty things to me. Continually pounding
[1:04:53] on me. What does the word of God say?
[1:04:57] The Old Testament law says an eye for an
[1:04:59] eye, right?
[1:05:01] But we know that the word of God also
[1:05:02] says that a soft word turneth away
[1:05:06] wrath.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be wise as serpents
[1:05:10] and harmless as doves. If we just take
[1:05:13] the word of God and and take it and use
[1:05:16] it as a club to suit our needs, what's
[1:05:18] going to happen is we're not going to
[1:05:20] have the experience that we're talking
[1:05:22] about. It's going to be a a head
[1:05:25] knowledge full of of the word that we
[1:05:28] think we understand, even including the
[1:05:29] message of the hour. But it's not going
[1:05:31] to give us the overcoming power. And
[1:05:33] tonight I want to talk about how we can
[1:05:35] have wisdom of the word, the Lord's
[1:05:38] wisdom by the spirit in our lives that
[1:05:40] will give us the ability to pull the
[1:05:42] sword of the word and actually have
[1:05:45] knowledge on how to to to swing it,
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; how to to to use that sword skillfully
[1:05:52] and and know that we can actually have
[1:05:54] success in our relationships. We can
[1:05:56] have success in in our our our marriages
[1:05:59] and and our our jobs, things that we
[1:06:02] encounter in this life. We don't have to
[1:06:04] just be slapped around by the devil. I
[1:06:07] think it's so beautiful because when we
[1:06:09] look at it, when we're getting
[1:06:10] tribulations, we glory in tribulations
[1:06:14] is what Paul says to the Romans. Knowing
[1:06:16] that tribulation workketh patience, it
[1:06:19] causes us to say, "Hold on a second.
[1:06:21] There's nothing that I can do in this
[1:06:23] situation except for look up." Amen.
[1:06:26] Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; And trust the Lord to work it out.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; And and what happens is it causes us to
[1:06:31] have patience in our lives and it
[1:06:34] stretches us to a place like maybe we
[1:06:36] thought we could never get to.
[1:06:39] But we know that he'll never give us
[1:06:40] anything more than we can bear. But once
[1:06:42] we get that patience, we have
[1:06:43] experience. We have knowledge on the
[1:06:47] Lord is actually looking after things.
[1:06:49] He's actually not just going to leave us
[1:06:51] or forsake us. He's going to take us
[1:06:53] through this trial. He's not going to
[1:06:54] take us around it and and allow us to
[1:06:56] avoid it. But he's going to take us
[1:06:58] through it and show us through patience
[1:07:00] that we have experience. And because of
[1:07:02] that experience, we're going to have a
[1:07:04] hope. I would say a supernatural hope
[1:07:06] because we know that he is in complete
[1:07:08] control.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; But verse 5 says, "And it hope maketh
[1:07:12] not ashamed doesn't make us ashamed to
[1:07:14] know that we've gone through things
[1:07:16] before in our life and he is able to
[1:07:19] take us through the situations." We're
[1:07:21] not ashamed of it. We're not ashamed of
[1:07:23] this gospel. We're not ashamed of this
[1:07:24] message. We're not ashamed of how we
[1:07:26] stand in the word of God, how we
[1:07:29] believe. We are not ashamed of it
[1:07:31] because the the love of God is shed
[1:07:33] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[1:07:35] which is given unto us. So beautiful.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Talking about the word of knowledge and
[1:07:41] how wisdom and knowledge go together.
[1:07:44] the revelation of the word by the spirit
[1:07:46] gives us knowledge and and we know that
[1:07:50] there's a gift of knowledge. It's it's
[1:07:52] it's a word maybe by the spirit of
[1:07:55] wisdom and there's another the word of
[1:07:58] knowledge. Sometimes we can have some
[1:08:01] insight into the word of God and and
[1:08:04] have a word of wisdom to say, well,
[1:08:06] maybe the scripture actually reads this
[1:08:08] way and we've read it our entire lives
[1:08:10] like this. But, you know, sometimes just
[1:08:12] even in a conversation, the Lord will
[1:08:14] come where he's invited and where
[1:08:16] there's just two people fellowshipping
[1:08:17] around the word or even in a service, we
[1:08:20] can catch a revelation about the word
[1:08:22] like we've never seen before.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is going to be that word
[1:08:27] of knowledge, bringing that word into
[1:08:30] our lives.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; In Proverbs chapter 8, let's turn over
[1:08:35] to Proverbs chapter 8.
[1:08:42] Proverbs chapter 8.
[1:08:46] I think it's
[1:08:48] marvelous
[1:08:50] how Solomon, the wisest man, I think we
[1:08:53] talked a little bit about this last
[1:08:55] week. If we did, I apologize, but I just
[1:08:59] think it's so good because it speaks to
[1:09:01] both
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; wisdom and knowledge. Proverb
[1:09:05] Proverbsapter 8:6 says here, "For I will
[1:09:09] speak excellent things, and the opening
[1:09:12] of my lips shall be right things."
[1:09:17] Who is this speaking here? We know that
[1:09:20] this is Solomon, isn't it? It's the
[1:09:23] wisest man that ever lived. But there's
[1:09:25] an inspiration behind this word, isn't
[1:09:27] it? It's the Lord through Solomon
[1:09:31] creating this proverb here. For I will
[1:09:34] speak of excellent things, [snorts] and
[1:09:36] the opening of my lips shall be right
[1:09:39] things. And I just think it's so
[1:09:42] important to remember this is the Lord
[1:09:44] speaking here. It's not just Solomon.
[1:09:47] For my mouth shall speak truth, and
[1:09:50] wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
[1:09:55] It just makes me think, you know, we
[1:09:57] wouldn't it be wonderful if we could
[1:09:59] have this as our words coming out of our
[1:10:02] mouths. The wisdom and revelation of
[1:10:04] this word in our lives creating the
[1:10:07] knowledge for us to actually live in our
[1:10:11] lives. We can hear this word and
[1:10:13] understand that the word that we're
[1:10:16] hearing is the right thing. And and let
[1:10:19] my mouth speak truth for my mouth shall
[1:10:23] speak truth. Verse seven, and wickedness
[1:10:26] is an abomination to my lips. I just
[1:10:29] don't want to hear it. I just don't want
[1:10:31] to say it. When the brother or the
[1:10:33] sister wants to start throwing off on
[1:10:35] someone, I just don't want to hear it.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, it's the best way to
[1:10:40] change a situation. Because when that
[1:10:42] happens, it's not actually people
[1:10:44] talking about people. It's devils trying
[1:10:47] to pass themselves off to other people
[1:10:49] in the congregation. It's a spiritual
[1:10:51] virus and it's nasty. When we start
[1:10:54] talking about one another,
[1:10:56] my mouth shall speak truth and
[1:10:59] wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
[1:11:03] I don't want to hear it.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he even talks about
[1:11:07] stuff like that. Sometimes we just need
[1:11:09] to say, "Shut up about that. Shut your
[1:11:12] mouth." I'm a living witness of it. I
[1:11:15] tried doing it one time with a brother
[1:11:17] about another brother and I was a junior
[1:11:20] Christian at the time. But I I was in
[1:11:22] this state where I was just I I I was so
[1:11:25] full of knowledge without wisdom. You
[1:11:29] know how people get there in their their
[1:11:31] their immature state of being a
[1:11:33] Christian walking this walk. We get
[1:11:35] there. It happens. It's part of the
[1:11:37] stages. We all have to go through it.
[1:11:39] The only problem is some people stay
[1:11:41] stuck there and and I think we talked
[1:11:43] about a little bit on Sunday where
[1:11:44] they're just smarter than everyone and
[1:11:46] and people just don't want to be around
[1:11:47] them because they could just you can't
[1:11:48] even relate to them. But anyways, I was
[1:11:51] in that state and I started throwing off
[1:11:53] about a brother and the brother that I
[1:11:54] was doing it with, he told me to shut
[1:11:56] up. He said, "I don't want to hear it. I
[1:11:58] don't want nothing to do with it." And I
[1:12:01] was like, "Oh."
[1:12:04] I felt embarrassed. And guess what
[1:12:06] happened is it shut me down. But what it
[1:12:09] did was it killed that devil.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; That's knowledge.
[1:12:14] That's knowledge by wisdom. I would say
[1:12:17] a word of knowledge. It's so beautiful,
[1:12:20] too, isn't it? Because we're not
[1:12:23] wrestling against flesh and blood,
[1:12:24] brothers and sisters. We're not fighting
[1:12:25] one another. We're not fighting against
[1:12:28] man. Once upon a time, it was like that
[1:12:30] to get into our inheritance. We're
[1:12:32] fighting devils,
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; principalities, and powers. And the
[1:12:35] devils travel in words. And and if we've
[1:12:39] got something other than truth coming
[1:12:41] out of our mouths, it's wickedness.
[1:12:45] Verse eight says, "All the words of my
[1:12:47] mouth are in righteousness. There is
[1:12:50] nothing forward or perverse in them."
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; My
[1:12:57] They are all plain to him that
[1:12:59] understandeth, and right to them that
[1:13:03] find knowledge.
[1:13:06] So beautiful, isn't it?
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; The right words, the truth, the
[1:13:11] understanding that we want, that we
[1:13:14] need, that we require for this knowledge
[1:13:17] to work the way that we want it to, for
[1:13:19] the gift of the spirit to work in our
[1:13:21] lives, it has to be centered around
[1:13:23] truth.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; It has to be centered around truth. And
[1:13:27] the truth that we're talking about is
[1:13:29] truly the Lord, the Holy Ghost in our
[1:13:31] lives. Verse 10 says, "Receive my
[1:13:33] instruction and not silver and knowledge
[1:13:37] rather than choice gold."
[1:13:40] Don't get so caught up in this world
[1:13:43] that all of our investments cause us to
[1:13:45] actually not be able to participate
[1:13:47] following the word of God. If anything
[1:13:50] in our life keeps us from following the
[1:13:52] word of God, we've got an idol.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. Anything that would
[1:13:57] take us and cause us to not be able to
[1:13:59] be obedient to God's word, which is his
[1:14:02] will, is an idol. And I'm saying that
[1:14:04] because I say, "Lord, help me.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me." There's so many things
[1:14:08] in this world now that can take us and
[1:14:10] just distract us. That's all the devil
[1:14:12] needs to do is just distract us.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to take us and push us
[1:14:15] over the cliff or or take us out to the
[1:14:18] clubs or get us sitting that way. He
[1:14:20] just needs to distract us. As long as
[1:14:22] we're distracted, we're not re realizing
[1:14:24] who we are. and he gains another day.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing, but we know that
[1:14:30] his time is running short, so he's
[1:14:31] working overtime and his guns are
[1:14:33] trained only on the bride. I remember my
[1:14:35] pastor, Brother Ken Ber, preaching that
[1:14:37] and saying that, and I couldn't
[1:14:39] understand that, but I could see it so
[1:14:40] clearly now. The whole entire world is
[1:14:43] already under the sway of the beast
[1:14:45] system. There's just no getting away
[1:14:46] from that. If you ever go into the ocean
[1:14:48] and you snorkel, you can see that
[1:14:50] everything in the water, it just goes
[1:14:53] with the sway of the current. It cannot
[1:14:55] resist the current. And it's the same
[1:14:57] thing in this world spiritually
[1:14:59] speaking. This whole entire world as
[1:15:01] we've witnessed, we've all been
[1:15:02] witnesses to it. The COVID pandemic was
[1:15:06] uh was it a plemic, a pandemic? Was
[1:15:08] there, you know, a virus or or the
[1:15:11] vaccination, vaccines, whatever about
[1:15:14] all of that. I will say this though, it
[1:15:16] was a test of the beast system.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; The beast system has proved it has full
[1:15:21] control of the entire world within 24
[1:15:24] hours. Who cares about all the rest of
[1:15:27] it? If it's a virus, go ahead, give it
[1:15:30] to me. If it's a vaccine, go ahead, give
[1:15:32] it to me. Mark 16 in action is the only
[1:15:35] true church. All else is false.
[1:15:38] It's not going to stop us. But this word
[1:15:41] of truth says, "Receive my instruction
[1:15:44] and not silver and knowledge rather than
[1:15:47] choice gold." Don't don't forfeit our
[1:15:50] rights to spiritual wisdom and spiritual
[1:15:53] knowledge to the things of this world.
[1:15:56] Don't do that. Verse 11 says, "For
[1:15:59] wisdom is better than rubies and all the
[1:16:01] things that may be desired are not to be
[1:16:04] compared with it." Then it goes into
[1:16:07] making it personal. I I think it's just
[1:16:09] so beautiful. I wisdom dwell with
[1:16:13] prudence
[1:16:14] and find out knowledge of witty
[1:16:18] inventions.
[1:16:20] The fear of the Lord is to hate evil,
[1:16:25] pride and arrogancy.
[1:16:30] Both of those two things, if we have
[1:16:32] those as a Christian, then we're still
[1:16:34] kind of missing the mark. I think we
[1:16:36] still probably have a little ways to go.
[1:16:38] And we all have a ways to go. There's no
[1:16:41] way that we can actually escape that.
[1:16:43] But the fear of the Lord is to hate
[1:16:45] evil. Pride and arrogancy and the evil
[1:16:48] way and the froward mouth.
[1:16:52] Who's talking here?
[1:16:54] Solomon. We already mentioned that
[1:16:56] someone else is talking. Solomon is a
[1:16:58] scribe.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; He had a wisdom that came from
[1:17:01] somewhere, didn't he? We talked about
[1:17:02] that last week. He had knowledge that
[1:17:05] came from somewhere. And and this is not
[1:17:07] Solomon saying this. The fear of the
[1:17:10] Lord is to hate evil. Pride, arrogancy,
[1:17:13] and the evil way and the froward mouth
[1:17:17] do I hate.
[1:17:19] Counsel is mine and sound wisdom.
[1:17:23] Now I I just love this part because he's
[1:17:25] not saying I have
[1:17:28] understanding and I have strength. What
[1:17:30] does he say? I am understanding.
[1:17:35] I have strength.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; I thought tonight I would just take a
[1:17:39] moment and bring this out of the
[1:17:40] Amplified Bible.
[1:17:43] Just just for the effect of it, I think
[1:17:45] it's so good. In in Proverbs 8 verse 6,
[1:17:48] it says, "Here, for I will speak
[1:17:50] excellent and princely things, and the
[1:17:53] opening of my lips shall be for right
[1:17:56] things.
[1:17:58] My mouth shall utter truth and
[1:18:01] wrongdoing
[1:18:03] is detestable and loathsome to my lips.
[1:18:09] All the Did you ever Did you ever have
[1:18:12] to go on your knees and ask the Lord to
[1:18:14] forgive you for something that you've
[1:18:16] done
[1:18:18] and and it's just almost even difficult
[1:18:20] to mention it to the Lord. It's because
[1:18:24] of the word. It's it's detestable and
[1:18:27] it's loathsome to our lips as believers.
[1:18:30] It's hard to say.
[1:18:33] Verse eight, all the words of my mouth
[1:18:35] are righteous, upright, and in right
[1:18:38] standing with God.
[1:18:41] There is nothing contrary to truth or
[1:18:43] crooked in them. I believe that truly is
[1:18:46] the position of a believer. someone who
[1:18:49] really believes this message of the
[1:18:50] hour. Someone who truly can call Jesus
[1:18:54] Lord.
[1:18:56] Excuse me. It's because it's by the Holy
[1:18:58] Ghost. Right? In verse 9, they are all
[1:19:01] plain to him who understands
[1:19:04] and opens his heart and right to those
[1:19:08] who find knowledge.
[1:19:10] I love this part. And live by it.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Not just talk about it.
[1:19:18] It's got to be lived, brothers and
[1:19:19] sisters.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Our lives need to demonstrate this
[1:19:22] message of the hour.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Our lives need to be more than just
[1:19:28] perhaps something that we do or or say.
[1:19:31] It's it's got to be actually the life
[1:19:33] that we live.
[1:19:36] Receive my instruction in preference
[1:19:40] to striving for silver and knowledge
[1:19:45] rather than choice gold.
[1:19:48] For skillful and godly wisdom is better
[1:19:50] than rubies or pearls and all the things
[1:19:53] that may be desired are not to be care
[1:19:56] compared to it. I wisdom from God says
[1:20:00] it plainly here make prudence my
[1:20:03] dwelling.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Prudence our desire to actually go and
[1:20:09] serve the Lord with all of our heart,
[1:20:12] our mind and our soul and consistently
[1:20:15] doing it.
[1:20:16] It's one thing to be so on fire for God
[1:20:18] and have all the revelation, but it's a
[1:20:21] totally different thing to realize that
[1:20:22] we're in a marathon race.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; It's not a speed across a speed race to
[1:20:28] get across the finish line. It's about
[1:20:29] getting across the finish line. And and
[1:20:32] being able to do all of the little
[1:20:33] things in a prudent fashion is uh it's
[1:20:37] not easy.
[1:20:39] But I wisdom from God make prudence my
[1:20:41] dwelling and I find out knowledge and
[1:20:44] discretion. The reverent fear and
[1:20:46] worship, worshipful awe of the Lord
[1:20:49] includes the hatred of evil, pride,
[1:20:54] arrogance, the evil way, and perverted
[1:20:58] and twisted speech. I hate
[1:21:03] I think it's amazing because you know we
[1:21:05] ought to be able to have the exact same
[1:21:07] speech here with brothers and sisters
[1:21:10] that we have at home or that we have in
[1:21:12] the car
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; or that we have at work or that we have
[1:21:15] at school. We ought to be having the
[1:21:17] exact same speech. We ought to be
[1:21:19] speaking the same words, speaking the
[1:21:21] same way, having the same behaviors, not
[1:21:24] acting differently just because we're in
[1:21:26] a certain position or a certain place.
[1:21:29] And I speak from experience because I
[1:21:32] know that I have gone down that road as
[1:21:34] a message believer. I'm not just talking
[1:21:35] about being out in the world. I'm
[1:21:37] talking about being saved, sanctified,
[1:21:39] justified, and and filled with the Holy
[1:21:41] Ghost, but just maybe not as prudent as
[1:21:44] I ought to be, which causes the ability
[1:21:47] for these things to creep in our lives.
[1:21:50] But you know, he says here, "The
[1:21:52] reverent fear and worshipful awe of the
[1:21:55] Lord includes the hatred of evil, pride,
[1:21:59] arrogance, the evil way, and perverted
[1:22:01] and twisted speech." I I think it's
[1:22:04] important to just recognize that this
[1:22:07] scripture here, this verse, it actually
[1:22:09] speaks to the life of a believer.
[1:22:12] This is this this would be like I would
[1:22:15] be saying this the reverent fear and
[1:22:17] worshipful awe of the Lord my worshipful
[1:22:20] fear and awe of the Lord would include
[1:22:23] the hatred of evil. Is is that our
[1:22:26] desire? Is that the way that we would be
[1:22:28] able to say that tonight? That that we
[1:22:30] hate evil, we hate pride. We hate
[1:22:33] arrogance the evil way and perverted and
[1:22:36] twisted speech. I hate Do you hate that
[1:22:40] tonight? Amen.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Verse 14 says, "I have counsel and sound
[1:22:45] knowledge. I have understanding. I have
[1:22:48] might and power."
[1:22:51] I just wanted to go back to uh this book
[1:22:54] here.
[1:22:56] And uh unfortunately the print is just a
[1:22:58] little bit too small now. So I've got to
[1:23:01] do that. But you know, brother Bradom,
[1:23:03] he gets asked this question and I think
[1:23:05] it's important as we read about the the
[1:23:08] spiritual gifts that happen in the
[1:23:10] church that should be happening in the
[1:23:11] church. By the way, brother Bradam said
[1:23:13] it that um you know every church, every
[1:23:15] praying assembly ought to see these
[1:23:18] gifts happening in the church. But this
[1:23:21] this question came up. It's uh out of
[1:23:23] questions and answers.
[1:23:26] He says, "Does he at all times have
[1:23:28] control over the spirit as to when and
[1:23:31] how to act?" I think it's just an
[1:23:34] interesting question all around because
[1:23:36] does he have control over the spirit? It
[1:23:38] sounds like a different
[1:23:40] person or a different being. Does he
[1:23:43] have control over the spirit? The spirit
[1:23:45] is he.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; He is the spirit, right?
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; We understand that. But he says, "Yes,
[1:23:51] sir. Yes, sir. The Holy Spirit
[1:23:52] controls." Yes, sir. It has control of
[1:23:55] you and you have control of it and it'll
[1:23:58] never make you do anything contrary to
[1:24:01] the scripture.
[1:24:03] It'll make the spirit does not misbehave
[1:24:05] itself unseemingly.
[1:24:08] That's right. Okay.
[1:24:11] I think that's uh just such a beautiful
[1:24:13] thing. We don't have to worry about
[1:24:15] spiritual gifts. And and I think
[1:24:18] probably this would be the overarching
[1:24:20] thought that I felt led to get into when
[1:24:23] we talk about spiritual gifts is we
[1:24:25] don't have to be afraid of them. I would
[1:24:28] think that we have to be afraid that we
[1:24:29] don't see them.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Not because we want to put gifts ahead
[1:24:33] of anything, but the prophet said that
[1:24:35] any good praying church ought to see all
[1:24:38] of those gifts manifesting. And they are
[1:24:40] part of the church. So I'm not saying
[1:24:44] where are they because I know they're
[1:24:45] here. Amen.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; They're here. Every single one of them.
[1:24:50] We have no worries. There's no fear at
[1:24:52] all. I have another quote that I wanted
[1:24:54] to bring. What visions are in in talking
[1:24:58] about this gift in particular of the
[1:25:02] word of knowledge and the word of
[1:25:04] wisdom. They kind of go hand in hand.
[1:25:05] The way Solomon talked about them. I
[1:25:08] could have brought a lot of scriptures
[1:25:09] out of Proverbs. I will leave that to
[1:25:12] you if you desire to to read them and
[1:25:14] and just see what the Lord would reveal
[1:25:17] to you by his wisdom. And uh you'll see
[1:25:21] what I mean. I'm sure you understand
[1:25:23] that there's a lot in Proverbs, but out
[1:25:26] of what visions are in 1956,
[1:25:30] but a vision is God
[1:25:33] by a word of knowledge
[1:25:37] dropping to the person to foresee or
[1:25:40] foresee something tells something that
[1:25:44] has been or something that will be.
[1:25:48] Now before the other quote we read,
[1:25:50] brother Brandham talked about it being
[1:25:53] something that God gives to the prophet.
[1:25:56] So there's many different the point that
[1:25:58] I want to get to here a little bit of it
[1:25:59] anyways is there's many different ways
[1:26:01] for this to actually manifest. And I I
[1:26:04] think it's so amazingly beautiful. We
[1:26:06] talked about it last week. I believe
[1:26:07] that it's not hard and fast that it has
[1:26:09] to be exactly this way every single time
[1:26:12] or it's actually false. That is true
[1:26:15] when we get into tongues and
[1:26:17] interpretations and prophecy and we're
[1:26:19] going to get into those. There is a very
[1:26:21] specific way that it's supposed to be
[1:26:23] done. And Paul set that church in order
[1:26:24] and brother Bannam came and amplified
[1:26:26] that in the age in which we live. But
[1:26:28] for these two specific gifts, the word
[1:26:30] of wisdom and the word of knowledge,
[1:26:32] there's many different ways they can
[1:26:33] manifest. Yeah. And I think it's just so
[1:26:35] beautiful because it's the Lord. How are
[1:26:37] we ever going to take him and put him in
[1:26:39] a box?
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Right. I love how he says it in this
[1:26:42] word that it's given by the spirit, the
[1:26:45] word of wisdom and to another the word
[1:26:47] of knowledge by the same spirit.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; And it's not another spirit. It's Jesus
[1:26:51] Christ, the one that we call Lord. It's
[1:26:53] the Holy Ghost. But what visions are,
[1:26:56] brother Brown says, a vision is God by a
[1:26:59] word of knowledge dropping to the person
[1:27:03] to foresee or forth see something. Tells
[1:27:07] something that has been or something
[1:27:10] that will be. Now remember, we talked
[1:27:13] about this as well. When we get the
[1:27:15] people that are they're spiritual and
[1:27:18] they see things and they have visions
[1:27:20] and dreams and all these things,
[1:27:23] remember brother Brandham said dreams
[1:27:24] are secondary. They have to come to pass
[1:27:27] exactly the way we dream them in order
[1:27:30] for them to actually be something that
[1:27:32] we want to pay attention to. But when we
[1:27:34] have these things that happen, there's
[1:27:36] people that are spiritual and they act
[1:27:38] out gifts in their lives, but they miss
[1:27:41] one here and they miss one there.
[1:27:44] They're not actually firing every single
[1:27:46] time when it actually happens. And you
[1:27:48] know what that is? That's actually
[1:27:51] incorrect. The word of God says that if
[1:27:54] it happens every single time according
[1:27:55] to the way they bring it, then hear that
[1:27:57] man. But if it doesn't happen exactly
[1:28:01] every single time, they're a false
[1:28:03] prophet.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And the word says to not hear that man.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say or woman.
[1:28:11] I've heard of lots of female
[1:28:14] prophetesses in the message of the hour.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; And I mean, anyways, either it's right
[1:28:22] or it's wrong. If it's not right every
[1:28:25] time, it's wrong
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; all the time. But, you know, there is
[1:28:30] one that's not wrong, and I'm getting
[1:28:32] back into it again, and I don't want to
[1:28:33] yet, but it is just so we know that that
[1:28:36] I'm not trying to throw off on anything,
[1:28:38] but there is a very specific way to
[1:28:40] know. If God is going to show someone
[1:28:42] somewhere along the way, we're going to
[1:28:43] get into this very specifically later,
[1:28:45] but if God is going to show someone,
[1:28:47] don't drive home tonight, brother Peter,
[1:28:49] don't drive home Stony Trail tonight. Go
[1:28:52] the other way. Take another road. maybe
[1:28:54] go up down up to 52nd Street and drive
[1:28:57] all the way up 52nd Street all the way
[1:28:59] up to your house because there's going
[1:29:00] to be a terrible accident with a car
[1:29:02] that's your color.
[1:29:04] It will come to the church. It will
[1:29:06] already be tested by two or three
[1:29:08] witnesses and it will actually happen
[1:29:10] exactly the way that it's said. That's a
[1:29:13] prophecy that would come forward, but it
[1:29:15] would have to be done properly according
[1:29:17] to the church.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; And if it's true, it will actually come
[1:29:21] exactly the way it's said. But that's
[1:29:24] what I'm saying. There's a very specific
[1:29:26] way that's laid out in the word that's
[1:29:27] actually brought by Paul that's ma
[1:29:30] magnified by William Bratam about the
[1:29:32] way prophecies and speaking in tongues
[1:29:34] should happen. But here we are. We're
[1:29:36] talking about the word of wisdom, the
[1:29:38] word of knowledge. Jumping ahead of
[1:29:39] myself, but a vision is of God by a word
[1:29:42] of knowledge dropping to the person to
[1:29:43] foresee to foresee something. Tell
[1:29:45] something that has been or something
[1:29:47] that will be. Now I'm going to make it
[1:29:49] real simple. I just love that we got
[1:29:52] little brighteyed children sitting here
[1:29:54] and if Jesus terries that's the men and
[1:29:56] women of tomorrow and that applies
[1:29:59] tonight. I think that too many times
[1:30:01] that we make the gospel so complicated
[1:30:04] and I'll say it this way so deep
[1:30:07] sometimes we just want the deep things.
[1:30:08] the deep things. We want the mysterious
[1:30:10] things. Remember, there's no more
[1:30:11] mystery.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; The deep things are already explained.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; But we have make the gospel so
[1:30:18] complicated that just maybe the adults
[1:30:21] and so forth could understand it and
[1:30:23] don't realize that those little children
[1:30:25] get it also. Kids are pretty smart.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to say there's a circus
[1:30:32] in town. Now, first thing I want to say
[1:30:34] that all gifts and callings are without
[1:30:37] repentance. The scripture says that who
[1:30:39] talking through can add one cubit to his
[1:30:42] stature.
[1:30:44] You are because God has made you.
[1:30:48] He says this here. Some time ago a woman
[1:30:51] came to a meeting. She was at home.
[1:30:53] Something struck her. She had arthritis.
[1:30:57] She was drawn up. Something struck her
[1:31:00] that the Lord was going to heal her.
[1:31:03] Isn't that beautiful?
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes that happens to us.
[1:31:08] Something struck her that the Lord was
[1:31:10] going to heal her.
[1:31:12] She knew it positive.
[1:31:15] She wasn't guessing at it. She knew it
[1:31:17] was so.
[1:31:19] So when she got a cab and stepped out of
[1:31:22] the stretcher into the cab, can you
[1:31:24] imagine? She stepped out of a stretcher,
[1:31:27] got up off a stretcher to get into a
[1:31:28] cab, brought her to the place while in
[1:31:32] the meeting that night, not even prayed
[1:31:34] for, but when she seen the spirit of God
[1:31:38] working, moving,
[1:31:41] she said, "That's it, Lord Jesus. That's
[1:31:44] what I've looked forward to."
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Remember, brothers and sisters, say the
[1:31:52] right things.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:55] Saying the wrong things we just heard
[1:31:56] about. He hates it when we say the wrong
[1:31:59] things.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, help me.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; I ain't claiming to be an angel.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; I am a sinner saved by grace." And many
[1:32:07] times my mouth gets away on me. My my
[1:32:10] speech betrays me. But, you know, I know
[1:32:13] that I'm a son of God and I will always
[1:32:15] come back to center. I will always try
[1:32:18] and make it right. But say the right
[1:32:21] thing. That's what we need to do. had
[1:32:24] right said the right thing. Remember,
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to emphasize that a
[1:32:28] little bit tonight. Remind us about
[1:32:30] that. They were just sitting around
[1:32:32] eating something. They were eating I'm
[1:32:34] not going to say it tonight. They were
[1:32:35] eating something. They were drinking
[1:32:37] coffee and and while they were there
[1:32:39] doing that, they were just
[1:32:40] fellowshipping around the table. How
[1:32:42] many of us just fellowship around the
[1:32:43] table with a couple or three believers
[1:32:45] and we just talk about the things of the
[1:32:47] Lord? And do we just talk about the
[1:32:49] things that God's done for us
[1:32:51] specifically? Can we put our finger on
[1:32:53] when God came by and he did this for me?
[1:32:56] And it sounds crazy. Sometimes the
[1:32:59] things that the Lord does for us is
[1:33:00] truly a paradox, isn't it?
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; It's unbelievable, but yet it's exactly
[1:33:06] true.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; You can't explain it, but it's 100%
[1:33:10] real. How did my bank account change?
[1:33:12] How did that bill get paid? How did I
[1:33:14] get that job? How did I get those
[1:33:16] grades? How did I find that spouse? I'm
[1:33:18] sure that every one of us could say
[1:33:20] that. How did I find that spouse? It's
[1:33:22] the grace of God in our lives.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; But we can talk about these things and
[1:33:27] as we talk about these things, I just
[1:33:29] think it's so beautiful because it's
[1:33:31] exactly what happened with brother
[1:33:32] Brandham. We say the right thing. God
[1:33:35] appreciates that, doesn't he?
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; And God through his prophet told that
[1:33:40] woman, I appreciate that. I am happy to
[1:33:44] hear you said the right thing. You made
[1:33:47] me happy. So, I'm going to make you
[1:33:49] happy and I'm going to tell you, ask
[1:33:51] what you want.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Specifically, you want a million
[1:33:55] dollars. You need money. You're poor. Do
[1:33:58] you want your sister that we've prayed
[1:33:59] for many times? Now, this is the prophet
[1:34:01] of God who had the prayer prayer lines,
[1:34:03] the the healing ministry. We prayed for
[1:34:05] her already, but she's still not healed.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; She requested the one thing of eternal
[1:34:11] value.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; She said the right thing,
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:16] So I want to say tonight, are we saying
[1:34:17] the right thing?
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; If we want to see this word of wisdom
[1:34:21] and the word of knowledge in our lives,
[1:34:23] if we want to see these gifts manifest,
[1:34:26] you know, don't even put it in the body.
[1:34:28] Take it out of the body because I'm not
[1:34:30] promoting it in the body even though
[1:34:31] I've said it that way. What about our
[1:34:33] lives? To have the revelation by the
[1:34:36] spirit to know how to use the word of
[1:34:39] God, to have the knowledge on how to
[1:34:41] stand against the ws of the enemy.
[1:34:45] But this woman, she stepped out of their
[1:34:47] stretcher into the cab and and brought
[1:34:49] her to the place while in the meeting
[1:34:50] that night, not even prayed for, but
[1:34:51] when God seen see when but when she seen
[1:34:55] the spirit of God working, moving, she
[1:34:57] said, "That's it, Lord Jesus. That's
[1:34:59] what I've looked forward to. Thank you."
[1:35:01] And when she got out of the cab, she
[1:35:03] never even got prayed for. When she got
[1:35:05] out got out of the cab, the cab said,
[1:35:08] "Madam, should I come back after the
[1:35:10] service and pick you up?" Said, "I won't
[1:35:13] need you. I'm going to walk home.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; God revealed it to her.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; And I just can't help but think a word
[1:35:24] of wisdom dropped into her heart.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; A revelation dropped into her heart and
[1:35:29] it gave her knowledge how to deal with
[1:35:31] the situation. She had faith that came
[1:35:34] from somewhere.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; That's next level faith. That's God's
[1:35:38] own faith living out through us, isn't
[1:35:39] it? I'm not going to need you. I'm just
[1:35:42] going to walk home. But she had to crawl
[1:35:44] off a stretcher to get into the cab.
[1:35:47] And while the service was going on, the
[1:35:49] Lord straightened those crippled legs
[1:35:51] and she got right up and walked home.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Of course, it was noised abroad.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; And another woman said, "You know, I'm
[1:36:02] going to do the same thing."
[1:36:05] She takes a cab and goes up, tells the
[1:36:10] cab to leave,
[1:36:12] but the cab had to come back and get
[1:36:14] her. She was trying to mimic somebody
[1:36:17] else's faith.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; And you can't do that.
[1:36:25] And I just want to encourage us tonight,
[1:36:27] brothers and sisters, let's not try and
[1:36:28] mimic anybody else's faith.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:32] Let's try and surrender ourselves to the
[1:36:34] Lord maybe in a way like we never have
[1:36:36] before so that we can have that
[1:36:38] revelation by the word by the spirit
[1:36:41] that revelation of the spirit for the
[1:36:43] word of God to give us knowledge in how
[1:36:46] to use it.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Not looking at other people's
[1:36:50] experiences even though it's good to
[1:36:52] talk about but it's all an individual
[1:36:54] experience. God deals with Israel as a
[1:36:57] nation
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; but he deals with the Gentiles as
[1:37:00] individuals. Amen.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; And and you know, this jumped out at me
[1:37:03] this morning, too, when I was on the
[1:37:04] line. Oh, they just they asked me to
[1:37:06] take this the the the lesson today. It
[1:37:09] was spur of the moment. And I said, "All
[1:37:10] right, let's go. I'll be in in season,
[1:37:12] out of season." But, you know, God
[1:37:14] created us in his own image. We know
[1:37:17] that. We say it many times. We hear it
[1:37:19] lots of times. God created us in his own
[1:37:21] image. But one of the things that I
[1:37:23] think that really jumped out for me this
[1:37:25] morning was that he created us in his
[1:37:27] image to be a free moral agent.
[1:37:31] He gave us the ability to choose
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; and and our choice as sons and daughters
[1:37:39] of God will always choose the word of
[1:37:42] God.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; We will always choose the correct thing.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; One day I'm going to get into preaching
[1:37:47] on being predestined and fornowledge and
[1:37:51] all of that. But you know, just in a a
[1:37:53] quick summary in in a couple minutes
[1:37:55] before we close here to know that we
[1:37:58] actually
[1:38:00] are a free moral agent, God
[1:38:03] predestinated us to the adoption of
[1:38:07] sons,
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; He didn't force us down a pipe
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; to go to adoption. No, no. He created us
[1:38:14] in his own image so that we would choose
[1:38:16] the right thing.
[1:38:18] And because we're able to choose the
[1:38:19] right thing, then we're able to be
[1:38:21] placed as a son.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; But it's nothing that we could do. It's
[1:38:26] everything that he has done.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; He just knew what we would choose.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; But this woman here, he talks about it.
[1:38:33] He says she was trying to mimic somebody
[1:38:36] else's faith. I say, "Lord, don't let us
[1:38:38] mimic anybody else's faith."
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; He says, "You can't do that. The devil
[1:38:44] knows better than that.
[1:38:47] You can't fool him.
[1:38:49] You've got to have what you profess you
[1:38:52] have.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful. And that goes
[1:38:55] back to our first discussion. When the
[1:38:58] time comes for us to look back on our
[1:39:00] lives, I think we're going to be able to
[1:39:02] start flipping pages in our lives. And
[1:39:04] some of us are going to be able to say,
[1:39:06] "My book is just full of amazing
[1:39:09] decisions. I just made good decision
[1:39:11] after good decision. My good decision,
[1:39:14] good chapter, good decision." And all of
[1:39:16] those are just fantastic decisions and I
[1:39:19] just I'm so thankful. And some of us are
[1:39:21] going to be like, you know, I just want
[1:39:22] to skip past that first half of the
[1:39:24] book. I'm just going to skip past that.
[1:39:26] I don't want to look at that at all.
[1:39:28] But, you know, from from that chapter
[1:39:30] right there, from that place right
[1:39:31] there, man, the decisions changed
[1:39:33] entirely. I just started to make
[1:39:35] decisions that were just out of this
[1:39:36] world. And that's why I'm here. I can
[1:39:38] say that I made it because somehow I was
[1:39:41] able to make the right decisions.
[1:39:44] I just was thinking about that today. It
[1:39:46] just maybe it's a little bit weird. I'll
[1:39:48] call the musicians. But you know, that's
[1:39:50] all we're going to do is be able to look
[1:39:51] back and say that. And you know, there's
[1:39:53] coming a time where all of that's going
[1:39:55] to be in the past.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; We're not going to be looking back at
[1:39:59] this world because we know there's
[1:40:00] coming a time where he's going to wipe
[1:40:01] away all of our tears.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; And they're not going to be all tears of
[1:40:05] sadness. They're going to be tears of
[1:40:06] joy. He's going to give us a thousand
[1:40:07] years to get all of the hallelujah and
[1:40:10] praise the Lords. And I'm so glad you
[1:40:12] made it, brother Dawn. Oh my. Brother
[1:40:14] Aiden, I was so happy when I saw you the
[1:40:16] first time on the other side. Brother
[1:40:18] Peter, we did it. We everything that we
[1:40:20] fought for, we've made it. We're going
[1:40:22] to have a thousand years to get all of
[1:40:24] those out of the way. And then there's
[1:40:26] going to be a new Jerusalem that comes
[1:40:28] down. And behold, all things are going
[1:40:30] to become new in our lives. But you
[1:40:33] know, while we're here, brothers and
[1:40:34] sisters, there is a word of wisdom for
[1:40:37] us.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; And there is a word of knowledge as
[1:40:41] well.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; And I believe they're given to us to
[1:40:44] profit us with all our entire lives to
[1:40:47] give us the ability to know how to live
[1:40:49] in the world that we live in. God bless
[1:40:51] you tonight. Maybe stand with me as we
[1:40:53] close.
[1:40:56] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank
[1:40:58] you for your word. Thank you, Lord, that
[1:41:01] we know that, Father, there's an
[1:41:03] everlasting gospel
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; and that's what we preach, Lord. That's
[1:41:08] what we love, this everlasting gospel.
[1:41:11] And we know that there's coming a time
[1:41:12] where it will actually not be used
[1:41:16] anymore
[1:41:18] because we know that everlasting is a
[1:41:20] space of time.
[1:41:22] And Father, we're so thankful that you
[1:41:24] have called us to be your sons, to be
[1:41:27] your daughters.
[1:41:29] Father, we pray that Lord, we could just
[1:41:31] consecrate ourselves unto you greater.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Father, every one of us, I know we need
[1:41:36] to just make sure that we check up on a
[1:41:39] regular basis.
[1:41:42] Father, I pray that you would just make
[1:41:44] yourself so real to each and every one
[1:41:46] of us, Father. That Lord, you would just
[1:41:49] be able to fill us so full with your
[1:41:52] spirit, Lord Jesus, that all of these
[1:41:54] things that we read about tonight would
[1:41:56] just have no more place in our lives.
[1:41:58] Amen.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; That Lord, we would run every single
[1:42:01] thought into captivity as you have
[1:42:04] instructed through your word. That we
[1:42:06] would recognize that Lord, even though
[1:42:09] the great ships they can go, wherever
[1:42:11] the captain lists by that by that rudder
[1:42:14] on the back of it. Oh, but Father, many
[1:42:16] times we can't even control our tongues.
[1:42:19] Father, I pray that you would just by
[1:42:21] your spirit give us revelation, Father.
[1:42:24] Give us a word of wisdom, Father, that
[1:42:27] would Lord Jesus, give us knowledge on
[1:42:29] how to take those thoughts into
[1:42:31] captivity and not give place to the
[1:42:33] devil any longer, Father, that your
[1:42:36] spirit would be able to live out through
[1:42:37] us in a greater way than ever before.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Father, that's I I believe that's the
[1:42:43] desire of every one of your children is
[1:42:45] to see a greater manifestation of you in
[1:42:48] our lives.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Myself included, Lord. We all need you,
[1:42:53] Father. Amen.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, tonight if anybody needs
[1:42:58] something special from you, Father,
[1:43:00] maybe before we leave this service, I
[1:43:02] pray that Lord, you would grant it to
[1:43:04] them in a special way, Father. Maybe
[1:43:06] somebody doesn't know you in the power
[1:43:07] of your resurrection. Maybe somebody
[1:43:09] doesn't know you, Father. Lord,
[1:43:12] according to the baptism of your Holy
[1:43:14] Spirit, Father, maybe some of us have
[1:43:16] grown cold, Lord. our experience has has
[1:43:19] cool cooled off, Lord, and we just need
[1:43:21] a little bit of a a top up of your
[1:43:24] spirit in our lives, Father.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; We know that you're more than able to
[1:43:28] meet every one of those.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Father, let us not leave this building
[1:43:32] the same way that we came in.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; And Father, if it be your will for us to
[1:43:36] gather again on Sunday, we'll be careful
[1:43:38] to give you all the praise.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would be with
[1:43:41] all those who couldn't be here tonight.
[1:43:42] Father, wherever they are, whatever
[1:43:44] they're doing, Father, bless them
[1:43:46] abundantly, Father, strengthen them and
[1:43:48] encourage them, Lord, that Father, maybe
[1:43:50] we'll be able to see them again soon.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; We just love you and we thank you. We
[1:43:55] ask all these things now. In Jesus
[1:43:58] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Can we sing 117? Thank you,
[1:44:05] Lord, for saving my soul.
[1:44:09] Remember the prayer meeting tomorrow
[1:44:10] night?
