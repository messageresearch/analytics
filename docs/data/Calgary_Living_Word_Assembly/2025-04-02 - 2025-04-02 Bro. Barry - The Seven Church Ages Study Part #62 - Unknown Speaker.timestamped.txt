[12:15] Let's bow our heads and
[12:21] hearts. Heavenly Father,
[12:24] Lord, we one more time come to your
[12:28] house, Father,
[12:30] Lord, not just in the flesh, Lord, and
[12:32] in the spirit, but Lord, our soul, Lord.
[12:35] Our soul truly rejoices, Father, when we
[12:38] Yes. come into your presence, Lord.
[12:41] Father, many times we don't feel it,
[12:44] Lord. Father, but we know you're here.
[12:47] For your word declares it, Father, and
[12:48] we believe, Lord. And sometimes it might
[12:50] take a minute. Sometimes maybe an hour,
[12:53] Lord, for us to truly get in the spirit,
[12:55] Lord, and give you the praise and honor
[12:57] and worship to truly just relax, Father,
[13:00] and allow you to have your way, Father.
[13:02] Amen.
[13:03] Father, may it be quicker tonight, Lord.
[13:05] May we just slip away, Father, in your

[13:13] voice coming through your word, Father.
[13:16] Amen. That is what we're here for, Lord.
[13:18] We're here to hear from you, Father.

[13:22] Lord, but we lift up your word. Amen.

[13:27] everything else is added on to us, Lord.
[13:28] We ask, Lord, we greet you once again in
[13:32] our presence, Father. Lord, we
[13:33] acknowledge your presence, Lord. We
[13:35] acknowledge Lord that we are needy. Yes.
[13:38] Father, we are failures Lord. But also,
[13:40] Father, because of your word and your
[13:42] life and your presence, Lord, we're
[13:43] overcomers. Thank you, Lord, for your
[13:46] word of life. Thank you for this
[13:48] opportunity, Lord, to tell you we love
[13:49] you. Father, to lift up our hands and
[13:52] our voices and give you the praise and
[13:53] worship, Father, that you're worthy of
[13:55] and that you desire and that we, Father,
[13:57] desire to give to you, Lord. Once again,

[18:50] for your special this evening.
[19:00] [Music]
[19:37] There are
[19:39] walls made by
[19:41] men, built by frail and human
[19:46] hands that an
[19:49] enemy can scale and get to you.
[19:56] But there is one protecting
[20:00] me from my
[20:03] greatest
[20:05] enemy. It's a
[20:07] wall that
[20:09] Satan can't break through.
[20:15] Sometimes a wall of
[20:18] grace,
[20:20] sometimes a wall of
[20:22] faith, other times
[20:26] gives me mercies that I
[20:30] [Music]
[20:31] need. But the one for which I
[20:36] long, it makes all the others strong. I
[20:41] need a
[20:43] wall of rest around me.
[20:51] My brother, when I'm
[20:53] weak, will you stand instead for me and
[20:59] pray a
[21:00] fortress around me strong that can't be
[21:04] moved?
[21:08] And I promise you
[21:11] today when I bow my knees to pray, I'll
[21:16] do my best to build a wall of prayer for
[21:22] you.
[21:26] Sometimes a wall of
[21:28] grace,
[21:30] sometimes a one
[21:33] of other times
[21:36] It's sweet mercy that I need.
[21:42] But the one for which I love, it makes
[21:47] all the others strong. I need a
[21:52] wall of prayer surrounding
[21:56] [Music]
[21:58] me. Sweet heart
[22:01] of breath.
[22:05] Sweet of
[22:07] bread that calls me
[22:11] from the
[22:13] water of
[22:15] care. But the one for which I
[22:20] love. It makes all the others strong. I
[22:25] need a
[22:26] wall of prayer surrounding me.

[23:14] him. Amen.
[23:18] Oh, when the music
[23:22] fades, all is stripped away.

[23:32] come, longing just to
[23:37] bring something that's
[23:40] worth that will bless your
[23:44] [Music]
[23:46] heart. I'll bring you more than a
[23:51] song. for a song in itself. It's not
[23:56] what you have
[24:01] required. You search much deeper
[24:06] within through the way things appear.
[24:10] You're looking into my heart.
[24:17] I'm coming back to the heart of
[24:23] worship. And it's all about
[24:27] you. It's all about you,
[24:31] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the things

[24:38] made. And it's all about
[24:42] you. It's all about you, Jesus.
[24:52] King of endless
[24:55] worth. No one could
[24:58] express how much you
[25:01] deserve. Though I'm
[25:05] weak. Though I'm weak and
[25:10] hold. All I have is yours.
[25:14] Every single
[25:20] breath I'll bring you more than a
[25:24] song. For a song in itself is not what
[25:29] you
[25:34] have. Oh, you search
[25:40] my way things.
[25:44] looking into my heart. Please stand with
[25:49] me. Oh, I'm coming

[32:39] the house of the Lord. Just a few
[32:41] requests we wanted to continue to
[32:43] remember brother Johnny
[32:45] Huckalak. Certainly thankful for the
[32:48] prayer for my nephew Zach Nadarak. He's
[32:50] been improving gradually. Amen. And we
[32:53] thank the Lord for that.
[32:55] couple of unspoken requests and some
[32:57] people who are traveling as well from
[32:59] the congregation. And if you have a need
[33:01] tonight, maybe just make it known by way
[33:04] of an uplift hand as we go to him.
[33:07] Gracious heavenly father, we thank you
[33:09] Lord that oh Lord Jesus, we can create a
[33:12] wall of prayer. Amen. We thank you for
[33:15] the body, Lord Jesus, that you have
[33:18] created here in Calgary, Lord, that we
[33:21] can gather together in your name,
[33:23] Father. We know that when we gather
[33:26] together in your name, that there is
[33:28] nothing that can stop your word from
[33:30] coming to pass, Lord. And Father,
[33:32] tonight, one more time, we are so
[33:35] thankful that we are gathered together
[33:36] in your name. And Lord, we just bring
[33:38] all these requests to you tonight,
[33:41] Father. We know that you are the only
[33:43] place that we can go with our requests
[33:45] in this world, Father. We know that it's
[33:48] the most powerful weapon there is. And
[33:51] Father, tonight we just take you at your
[33:53] word and we bring the request to you,
[33:54] Father. Lord Jesus, we want to thank you
[33:57] for touching Zack Natarak, Lord Jesus,
[34:01] knowing that only a touch from you can
[34:03] make a change. We just continue to thank
[34:06] you, Father, for that need. Lord, we
[34:09] thank you for watching over Johnny
[34:11] Huckluck in the situation that he's in,
[34:13] Lord. And we just commit him into your
[34:15] hands for your glory. Father, we just
[34:18] remember the unspoken requests in our
[34:20] midst, Lord. And we commit them into
[34:21] your hands, Father. You know the needs
[34:24] and you know the solutions, Father. And
[34:26] we just thank you, Father, for the
[34:27] solutions, Lord. Oh Lord, we pray for
[34:30] those who are traveling tonight. That
[34:32] you would grant them traveling mercies,
[34:33] Father. and that you would keep your
[34:35] angels encamped about them, Father, and
[34:37] that you would bless their time away and
[34:39] at the appropriate time, Father, that
[34:40] you would bring them home safely.
[34:43] Father, tonight we just want to commit
[34:45] this service into your hands, all that's
[34:46] spoken, Lord, now from this time forward
[34:49] into your hands. We thank you, Lord
[34:51] Jesus, for each life represented here.
[34:53] Help us all, Lord Jesus, to just pull
[34:56] upon you tonight, Father, that we could
[34:58] be fed. We just ask all these things now
[35:01] in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[35:05] Amen. Thank you
[35:09] musicians. Thank you for the special
[35:11] tonight. Really enjoyed that. What a
[35:14] tremendous thought that we can have a
[35:16] wall of prayer.
[35:18] We depend on that. If you have your
[35:21] Bibles tonight, I want to continue our
[35:23] study in the exposition of the seven
[35:25] church ages. And I believe tonight we
[35:27] will finish our study of the exposition
[35:31] of the seven church ages. If I counted
[35:34] correctly, we're 62 services in. And uh
[35:38] I don't think it's enough. I think that
[35:40] we could go back and start from the
[35:41] beginning and it would just be as fresh
[35:43] as it was. And uh there are uh there's
[35:47] at least one question that I'm aware of
[35:49] that I want to deal with as we go
[35:51] forward. So that's probably the first
[35:53] place we'll go. Um maybe even on Sunday
[35:56] we'll see what the Lord wants to do. But
[35:58] uh if you have any questions about what
[36:00] we've studied, please don't be bashful
[36:03] and uh just make it known. The book of
[36:06] Revelations
[36:07] 1 verse
[36:11] one, the revelation of Jesus Christ,
[36:14] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[36:17] servants things which must shortly come
[36:21] to pass. And he sent and signified it by
[36:24] his angel unto his servant
[36:28] John, who bare record of the word of
[36:30] God, and of the testimony of Jesus
[36:34] Christ, and of all things that he saw.
[36:38] Blessed is he that readeth, and they
[36:40] that hear the words of this prophecy,
[36:43] and keep those things which which are
[36:46] written therein, for the time is at
[36:49] hand.
[36:51] John to the seven churches which are in
[36:53] Asia. Grace be unto you and peace from
[36:57] him which is and which was and which is
[37:00] to come. And from the seven spirits
[37:03] which are before his throne. And from
[37:06] Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness
[37:10] and the first begotten of the dead and
[37:13] the prince of the kings of the earth.
[37:16] unto him that loved us and washed us
[37:19] from our sins in his own blood and hath
[37:23] made us kings and priests unto God and
[37:26] his father. To him be glory and dominion
[37:30] forever and ever. Amen. Amen. Let's just
[37:34] bow one more time. Heavenly Father, we
[37:36] thank you for the graphic description,
[37:39] Lord, of this word, Lord. and not just
[37:43] the descriptive words, Lord Jesus, that
[37:46] were written, though they're precious,
[37:48] but Father, the revelation that you have
[37:51] given to your church in this age.
[37:54] Father, we pray that we could just bring
[37:56] those two together tonight and allow you
[37:58] by your spirit to quicken it to our
[38:00] souls. We just commit the words that
[38:03] were read, that were spoken into your
[38:05] care, Father, in Jesus Christ's name we
[38:07] pray. Amen. God bless you tonight. You
[38:10] may be seated.
[38:14] Certainly thankful to be in the house of
[38:16] the Lord once again and uh thankful that
[38:19] we can gather together in his name. We
[38:23] see the days growing dark all around us
[38:26] and uh it's amazing to see this world
[38:29] and I just was watching an eagle in the
[38:32] sky today as it flew and I I watched it
[38:35] circle and you know it wasn't flapping
[38:37] its wings just like that song. It was
[38:39] just gliding. And I just thought, you
[38:42] know, how how many more days do we have
[38:44] here on this side of eternity? How how
[38:47] many more church services will we have?
[38:50] How many times will we have in prayer? I
[38:53] I don't know. We don't know. But this
[38:56] world is certainly in a position where
[38:58] it looks like it's fit for
[38:59] destruction. Boy, this study of the the
[39:03] exposition of the seven church ages has
[39:05] been a wonderful one. And uh I think
[39:08] that every time we read it, we can learn
[39:10] something from it. And I know there's
[39:11] been so many nuggets that have come out
[39:14] of it for me. I would just like to go
[39:16] back a little bit from where we left off
[39:18] last week and uh not too far, just one
[39:22] page and just pick up from paragraph 53
[39:25] in the red book here on the resume of
[39:28] the ages. It's just after Revelations 13
[39:33] 11-18. And brother Brandham, he talks
[39:35] about sort of a uh history of the
[39:39] church, if you will, and more so the
[39:42] Antichrist spirit, how it how it works
[39:44] in and around the church. And he says,
[39:47] "Now remember it was Imperial Pagan Rome
[39:50] that fell by the sword, but she was
[39:54] healed of her death stroke when she
[39:57] joined to the nominal Christian church
[40:00] of Rome and incorporated paganism and
[40:04] Christianity and thereby became the Holy
[40:07] Roman Empire which was to endure until
[40:11] Jesus came and destroyed her. But Rome
[40:15] is not going it alone. Her daughters are
[40:19] right with her and she will take
[40:23] absolute authority by the World Council
[40:27] of Churches. It's a pretty astounding
[40:31] thing. It's a pretty sobering thought to
[40:33] think about, but you can see that it's
[40:36] actually already taken place. It's
[40:39] already happened. We don't even have to
[40:40] say we're looking for a day where this
[40:43] could take place where potentially it's
[40:45] going to happen in the future. This has
[40:46] already happened. This part is history.
[40:49] And uh you know, you can see a more
[40:51] detailed study if you look at the the
[40:53] the Revelation series that Brother
[40:56] Brandham preaches. And even on the
[40:58] seals, both of them, I believe, go into
[41:01] the the imperial pagan Rome and uh the
[41:04] wound that happened to the pope to the
[41:08] antichrist and uh how it became the Holy
[41:11] Roman Empire. It went from imperial
[41:14] pagan Rome to the church of Rome the way
[41:17] it is today. Um as we've mentioned
[41:20] before, there's a a video out there of
[41:23] the ecclesiastical church in the United
[41:25] States. years ago. I think it's about 12
[41:28] years now, maybe plus or minus. But
[41:30] there was a a bishop uh Tony Palmer,
[41:34] Anthony Palmer, who was a friend of the
[41:36] pope current um and he did a video, they
[41:40] did a video, he was addressing all of
[41:43] the uh the churches and uh it was on
[41:47] behalf of the pope and basically his his
[41:49] his point was I I think there's a few
[41:53] really interesting points in there. He
[41:54] said he comes in the spirit of Elijah
[41:57] which was really interesting. He said
[41:59] that he comes in the spirit of
[42:01] restoration I believe as well. He says
[42:04] that uh you know the protest that Luther
[42:07] made against the Catholic Church that
[42:09] the just will live by faith. Uh he said
[42:12] that protest is over and that the
[42:14] Catholic word means universal. So if
[42:18] we're Christians then we're more alike
[42:20] than we are different. It it goes right
[42:22] into the discussion that we were talking
[42:24] about about uh Balum and Bailac. You
[42:28] know, we're more alike than we are
[42:29] different. Why don't we just worship
[42:31] together? And we know that was a a real
[42:33] big problem for Israel because God said
[42:36] that's that's it. I won't actually go
[42:38] any further with you. I'm I'm not going
[42:40] to respect that. That part won't be
[42:42] forgiven. And that's exactly what's
[42:44] happened with the churches now. So, we
[42:47] can look at this and say, you know, it's
[42:49] it's coming sometime. But I think
[42:51] through the lens of a prophet, we can
[42:53] say this has already happened. And I
[42:55] think it's pretty amazing to recognize
[42:57] that there's some other stuff that we
[42:59] talked about last week that have already
[43:01] happened. And I'm not going to go too
[43:02] far into that. But I I just wanted to
[43:04] pick up with this because you know how
[43:07] how late is it? The brother Bam when he
[43:10] was here right up till 1965, he said it
[43:13] so many times, it's later than you
[43:14] think. Many times we can have a
[43:17] preconceived notion of the way we think
[43:19] things should look and not recognize
[43:21] that things have already happened
[43:23] according to the way the word says it.
[43:25] And it's different than the way we
[43:28] think. He goes on to say, "This may seem
[43:30] far-fetched to some, but actually it's
[43:33] very plain for all to see because right
[43:36] now the churches are controlling
[43:39] politics." And you know, usually you
[43:43] will see a press release from the pope
[43:47] when something really big takes place in
[43:49] the world. You don't have to look very
[43:51] far and the pope will usually say
[43:53] something. Interestingly, when COVID
[43:56] happened, I don't know how many press
[43:58] releases happened from the Vatican. I
[44:00] don't think very many. I know I never
[44:01] saw very many and I was eagerly watching
[44:04] to see if there would be and there
[44:06] wasn't very many. So anyways, it's uh
[44:10] it's true what he says here. This may
[44:12] seem far-fetched to some, but actually
[44:14] it's very plain for all to see because
[44:16] right now the churches are controlling
[44:18] politics and at the opportune time will
[44:21] manifest exactly how great is that
[44:25] control. This ecumenical move will end
[44:28] up with Rome at the head even though the
[44:30] people did not envision it that way.
[44:34] This is so because in Revelation 17 3-6
[44:38] it states that the mystery Babylon
[44:41] is seated on the beast. She is
[44:44] controlling the last or fourth
[44:48] empire. That's an interesting thought.
[44:50] The last or fourth empire. We'll get
[44:54] into that. Not tonight though. This
[44:56] Roman church is doing that with the
[44:59] world church system under her. Rome will
[45:02] be controlling and this image church
[45:06] system will be obedient to Rome because
[45:09] Rome controls the gold of the world.
[45:13] I find it kind of interesting. I'm sure
[45:15] many other people do in different ways,
[45:17] especially if you're an investor.
[45:19] And looking at the world the way it is
[45:22] right now with uh the fourth empire
[45:25] imposing tariffs on everyone everywhere.
[45:29] What's going to happen with that? I
[45:32] don't think it's going to have a good
[45:33] outcome. But you know what's supposed to
[45:34] happen is exactly what we just read.
[45:36] Rome is going to take over control. The
[45:39] economy in this world is going to fail.
[45:41] That's exactly what's going to happen.
[45:43] And we know the prophet said that's thus
[45:44] sayeth the Lord. That's not the prophet.
[45:47] But here we see just a quick little
[45:49] blurb of how this is all going to
[45:51] happen. But we're seeing some strange
[45:53] things going on in this world today. And
[45:57] uh you know it's not really that
[45:58] far-fetched like he said. You can kind
[46:00] of see it taking shape out there. He
[46:04] goes on to say thus all the people have
[46:06] to belong to the world church system or
[46:09] be at the mercy of the elements for they
[46:12] cannot buy or sell without the mark of
[46:14] the beast in the hand or the head. Now,
[46:17] that sounds like a crazy far-fetched
[46:19] thing and and maybe it does. It's going
[46:22] to be out there. If anybody has ever
[46:23] seen the Left Behind series when I was a
[46:26] kid, there was an original one that was
[46:28] done and I went and watched it at a
[46:30] Baptist church. My family, my my my
[46:33] stepmother's family were Baptists. So,
[46:36] it was a real interesting conflict
[46:38] between the Baptists and the
[46:39] Pentecostals. I'm sure the Baptists said
[46:41] the Pentecostals didn't have it. And I
[46:43] know the Pentecostals said that the
[46:45] Baptists, they were way out there. They
[46:46] never had it. And uh but all claiming
[46:49] Christianity all the while, but one time
[46:51] we went to their church and we watched
[46:53] this video and it just it petrified me.
[46:55] It scared me to death as a child, not
[46:59] knowing that just getting the Holy Ghost
[47:01] in my life would prevent all of that
[47:03] nonsense from ever taking
[47:04] place. But I couldn't believe the the
[47:07] intensity of it. And uh you know that's
[47:09] the way many people form their opinion
[47:10] about the way the rapture is going to
[47:12] take place. And sure enough there will
[47:14] be a rapture of the church. There will
[47:15] be a molecular body change. But it's not
[47:18] going to be the way this world thinks
[47:20] that it's going to happen. It's going to
[47:21] happen exactly the way God's vindicated
[47:24] prophet said that it will happen. And it
[47:27] won't happen any other way. And it's
[47:29] such a beautiful thing to actually know
[47:31] that to see it. But you know, we're not
[47:34] talking tonight about seeing the mark of
[47:37] the beast in people. It's actually
[47:39] understanding that if people fall under
[47:42] the category of their church and not
[47:45] under the category of Christ, not the
[47:47] seal of God, then they're taking the
[47:49] mark of the beast. That's actually
[47:51] what's taking place. And and and maybe
[47:54] some people will say, "You're you're
[47:55] crazy, Brother Barry." But you know,
[47:56] that's what the prophet said. To reject
[47:58] the Holy Ghost is to have the mark of
[48:00] the beast because we already have Cain
[48:03] inside of us in this DNA. That's why
[48:05] this body will never ever inherit
[48:09] eternal life. This flesh has to perish.
[48:12] This pest house has to go back to the
[48:15] dust. But the soul is the only thing
[48:19] that is eternal.
[48:21] And he's working out the character in
[48:23] each and every one of us to fit that to
[48:26] be able to rule and reign. What a
[48:27] beautiful thing. But brother Brandham,
[48:29] he says this here. Thus, all the people
[48:31] have to belong to the world church
[48:33] system or be at the mercy of the
[48:35] elements for they cannot buy or sell
[48:37] without the mark of the beast in the
[48:39] hand or the head. This mark in the head
[48:43] talking about today this mark in the
[48:45] head means that they will have to take
[48:47] the doctrine of the world church system
[48:51] which is trinitarianism
[48:53] etc. and the mark in the hand which
[48:56] means to do the will of the world
[49:00] church. Shocking. But I know we're
[49:03] preaching to the choir tonight. I think
[49:05] it's amazing when we can see this. We're
[49:07] talking tonight about recognizing
[49:09] rejecting the Holy Ghost brings us to
[49:12] this place right here. And we don't have
[49:14] to sign up to it. We don't have to go
[49:16] anywhere for it because it will be so
[49:18] close that it will deceive the very
[49:20] elected. And unfortunately, every single
[49:22] church has three kinds of believers in
[49:24] it. And you know which one are we? I I I
[49:29] pray that every single one of us are the
[49:30] ones sealed with the Holy Ghost in our
[49:32] lives because any of the other two will
[49:34] have to go through the tribulation and
[49:36] they'll have to give their lives and
[49:38] actually give an account and stand
[49:39] before the white throne of judgment.
[49:42] But we have the opportunity to actually
[49:44] go and sit with him in his throne. What
[49:46] a tremendous thing that is. What a
[49:48] blessing it is.
[49:50] He says with this great power the church
[49:53] systems will persecute the true
[49:55] bride. This image will try to keep the
[49:59] bride from preaching and teaching etc.
[50:03] Her ministers will be forbidden to give
[50:05] comfort and truth to the people who need
[50:08] it. But before the antichrist in person
[50:13] takes over this complete world system of
[50:16] churches, the true church will be taken
[50:19] away from this world to be with the
[50:22] Lord. Isn't that beautiful? God will
[50:25] catch away his bride for the great
[50:29] marriage supper of the lamb. I just love
[50:32] how he he he brings it out. He he
[50:34] mentions it in in the message. I'm not
[50:36] sure which one, but he says it many
[50:39] times. People will argue one way.
[50:41] They'll say that, you know, we're we're
[50:43] the the bride of Jesus Christ is is
[50:45] pre-tribulation. The bride doesn't go
[50:48] through the tribulation. Some will say
[50:50] post and some will say
[50:53] mid. Some people will actually go
[50:55] through the tribulation, the bride of
[50:57] Jesus Christ, and and go partially
[50:59] through it or all the way through it.
[51:01] But brother Brandham, he says, "Why
[51:02] would a man marry a wife, have a
[51:05] marriage with a wife that he has to try
[51:08] and judge, that he has to try and
[51:11] redeem? He's already done it." What a
[51:14] tremendous thing it is. We don't marry
[51:16] someone that we're going to judge later.
[51:19] We have something wrong up here. If
[51:20] that's what we're going to do as a
[51:22] husband, we need to do that before we
[51:24] get married.
[51:26] Amen. But when we do
[51:28] that, she's our wife and that's that.
[51:32] Nothing can change it. It's such a
[51:34] beautiful thing. Why would we want to
[51:37] take our wife and put her through a
[51:38] tribulation? Some people want to do that
[51:40] in their
[51:41] marriages. But why would a a true
[51:43] Christian man want to put his wife
[51:45] through a tribulation? He's not going to
[51:46] do
[51:47] that. He's going to treat her like his
[51:50] bride. And that's exactly what the Lord
[51:53] said he would do. What a tremendous
[51:54] thought that
[51:56] is. Now, as this concluding chapter was
[51:59] given in order to trace the two true two
[52:02] churches and the two spirits from
[52:04] Pentecost, the upper room experience,
[52:07] not Isuza Street, from Pentecost to
[52:10] their consummation. We will take this
[52:13] final time to show this in the Leodysian
[52:16] age. This age started just after the
[52:19] turn of the 20th century as it was to be
[52:23] the age in which the true church would
[52:25] return to being the bride as she was at
[52:29] Pentecost. We know that there must be of
[52:33] necessity be a return of dynamic power.
[52:37] The believers sensed this in their
[52:40] spirits and began crying to God for a
[52:43] new outpouring such as was in the first
[52:48] century. What seemed to be the answer
[52:50] came as many began to speak in tongues
[52:53] and manifest gifts of the spirit. It was
[52:56] then believed that this was indeed the
[53:00] long awaited restoration.
[53:03] It was not for the latter rain can only
[53:08] come after the former rain which is the
[53:11] spring or teaching rain. The latter rain
[53:16] then is the harvest rain. How could this
[53:19] be the real thing when the teaching rain
[53:22] had not come?
[53:24] The prophet messenger who was to be sent
[53:27] to teach the people and turn the hearts
[53:30] of the children back to the Pentecostal
[53:33] fathers had not yet come. And we know
[53:37] that that's scripture. That's not just
[53:39] something that someone's saying. He's
[53:40] not referring to it. But that's Malachi
[53:42] 45 and six. We know that that's exactly
[53:46] what that is. For anybody that might
[53:48] look at this later, go and look at it.
[53:52] Malachi. He goes on to say, "Thus what
[53:56] was thought to be the restoration and
[53:58] the final quickening unto the rapture
[54:01] had not come." Imagine all the people
[54:04] that were actually anticipating this was
[54:07] it. This was the rapture. This all and
[54:09] on and on and on putting their own
[54:11] interpretation to the word of God and
[54:13] and trying to say that that was it. How
[54:16] disappointing it must have been. And and
[54:18] how much would it turn off maybe the the
[54:21] youth, the younger people coming up and
[54:23] the friends and family surrounding them
[54:25] watching them get all excited about the
[54:27] Lord and then for them to say this is
[54:29] the coming of the Lord. This is the full
[54:31] restoration when it wasn't quite yet
[54:33] time for that to take
[54:35] place. And as people see that it wasn't,
[54:38] then they would base all of their future
[54:41] judgment on the miscalculation of those
[54:44] individuals and say, "It's not for me.
[54:46] Why would I do that? How terrible. But
[54:49] there's no way you can stop
[54:51] it. In it was a mixture of the
[54:54] unrighteous partaking of the spiritual
[54:57] blessing and manifesting in the Holy
[55:01] Ghost. My as we have kept pointing out
[55:04] to you in it also was devil power as men
[55:09] were under the control of devils.
[55:12] Yet no
[55:14] one seemed to realize it. Isn't that
[55:17] amazing to think? No one seemed to
[55:19] realize it. They they were under the
[55:21] influence of of devil powers. They were
[55:24] under the influence of devil's spirit,
[55:26] but they were actually seeing a blessing
[55:28] from the Holy Ghost. What a tremendous
[55:31] thought that is. How could that possibly
[55:33] be? It doesn't even sound like it's
[55:35] possible, but it's very possible. If you
[55:38] listen to anointed ones at the end time,
[55:39] brother Brana makes it very clear. You
[55:42] know, the the simple explanation of it
[55:44] is power, true power, spiritual power
[55:47] without character, the character of
[55:49] Christ in your life. You can have it.
[55:52] You can actually have the anointing of
[55:54] the Holy Ghost every day of your life,
[55:56] every hour of your life, he says, and
[55:58] still go to hell. Why is that? Because
[56:01] you don't have his character. that
[56:03] character that comes from the fiery
[56:05] trials of
[56:07] life. Without that character, we can
[56:10] have all the power we want. We can have
[56:11] all the manifestation we want. We can
[56:12] have all the good church services, all
[56:14] the good worship services, all the good
[56:16] prayer meetings, everything good in our
[56:18] lives. My and still miss
[56:21] it. But if we get the Holy Ghost in our
[56:23] life, we'll never miss it. Because he,
[56:26] the spirit of truth, will never ever
[56:28] lead us into the wrong thing. He will
[56:31] always take us the right way.
[56:35] Goes on to say, "Then to prove that it
[56:36] was not the real," I love how it's
[56:39] capitalized there. These people even
[56:41] before a second generation had appeared.
[56:44] Not very far down the line, these people
[56:46] get dissuaded with it. They get
[56:47] disillusioned with it, right? Not not
[56:49] even after the second generation
[56:51] appeared, they organized. These people
[56:53] organized and wrote their unscriptural
[56:56] doctrines and built their own fences as
[56:59] every other group ahead of them
[57:02] did. Our group is better than their
[57:04] group. Our group doesn't do that. Our
[57:06] group does this da da da da da da da.
[57:09] You know, you don't even have to look
[57:10] back and see it there. It's here.
[57:13] He goes on to say, remember, while Jesus
[57:16] was upon the earth, so was Judas.
[57:20] Each came from a different spirit and
[57:23] upon death each went to his own place.
[57:26] The spirit of Christ later came back
[57:29] upon the true church and the spirit of
[57:31] Judas came back upon the false church.
[57:35] It's right there in Revelation 6. Once
[57:38] again, the reference point, it's so
[57:40] beautiful. Revelations 6 verse 1 to8.
[57:43] And I saw when the lamb opened one of
[57:45] the seals, and I heard as it were the
[57:48] noise of thunder, one of the four
[57:50] beasts, saying, Come and see. And I saw,
[57:54] and beheld a white horse, and he that
[57:56] sat on him had a bow, and a crown was
[57:59] given unto him, and he went forth
[58:01] conquering and to conquer. And when he
[58:03] had opened the second seal, I heard the
[58:05] second beast say, "Come and see." And
[58:08] there went out another horse that was
[58:10] red, and power was given to him that sat
[58:13] thereon to take peace from the earth,
[58:16] that they should kill one another. And
[58:18] there was given unto him a great sword.
[58:21] And when he had opened the third seal, I
[58:23] heard the third beast say, "Come and
[58:25] see." And I beheld, and lo, a black
[58:29] horse, and he that sat on him had a pair
[58:31] of balances in his hand. And I heard a
[58:34] voice in the midst of the four beasts
[58:36] say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and
[58:38] three measures of barley for a penny.
[58:41] And see thou hurt not the oil and the
[58:44] wine. And when he had opened the fourth
[58:48] seal, I heard the voice of the fourth
[58:50] beast say, Come and see. And I looked,
[58:55] and behold, a pale horse, and his name
[58:58] that sat upon him was death, and hell
[59:00] followed with him. And power was given
[59:03] unto him over the fourth part of the
[59:05] earth, to kill with a sword, and with
[59:08] hunger, and with death, and with the
[59:11] beasts of the
[59:12] earth. See how that Judas spirit came
[59:16] back as a rider on a white horse. It was
[59:20] white. So close to the real just as
[59:24] Judas was so close to
[59:26] Jesus. A crown was given to him. White
[59:29] horse rider. How that spirit was now in
[59:34] the leader of the nickelan system and he
[59:38] was a triple crowned pope who sat as god
[59:42] in his temple calling himself the vicer
[59:45] of
[59:46] Christ. If vicor of Christ means instead
[59:50] of Christ or in place of or on behalf of
[59:55] God, then the pope was calling himself
[59:57] the Holy Ghost or deposing the Holy
[1:00:00] Ghost acting for
[1:00:03] him. That was the Judas spirit in him
[1:00:06] doing that. See how he conquered going
[1:00:10] forth conquering and to
[1:00:13] conquer. Christ did not do that. Christ
[1:00:16] wasn't
[1:00:17] conquering. Christ did not do that. The
[1:00:20] only ones that came to him were already
[1:00:23] predestinated by the
[1:00:25] father. And so on and on went that
[1:00:30] spirit. And one day it will become truly
[1:00:33] incarnate in a man who will head up the
[1:00:37] world council of churches just as we
[1:00:41] have been
[1:00:42] saying. And and I know some people are
[1:00:45] probably going, "Amen, brother. There's
[1:00:47] going to be an American pope." And when
[1:00:50] we see that American pope, we're going
[1:00:52] to know that's the flashing red light of
[1:00:53] his coming. We'll see that signpost. You
[1:00:56] know what? That red that that that red
[1:00:58] sign, that that that flashing red light
[1:01:01] that that likely will happen. The
[1:01:03] prophet said there'll be an American
[1:01:05] pope. That could be just after or well
[1:01:07] after the rapture of the church of the
[1:01:09] living God. Don't look for a signpost.
[1:01:13] We've got the signpost. We've got all
[1:01:15] that we need to ready ourselves for that
[1:01:18] rapture to take place.
[1:01:21] Sure enough, maybe there will be an
[1:01:23] American pope. But who
[1:01:26] cares? We've got the word.
[1:01:29] He says, "And by his gold, remember
[1:01:32] Judas held the bag, he will control the
[1:01:35] whole world. And that antichrist system
[1:01:39] will own everything and try to control
[1:01:42] everybody.
[1:01:44] But Jesus will come back and destroy
[1:01:46] them all with the brightness of his
[1:01:48] coming. And their end will be the lake
[1:01:53] of fire.
[1:01:57] I just think it's so interesting as I
[1:01:59] was studying
[1:02:01] this, you know, I'll just read the next
[1:02:04] paragraph before we get into the
[1:02:05] scripture. He he says, "But what about
[1:02:08] the true seed? It will happen just as we
[1:02:11] have said. The people of God are being
[1:02:14] made ready by the word of truth from the
[1:02:17] messenger to this age." Isn't that
[1:02:21] wonderful?
[1:02:23] While I was studying this in between
[1:02:24] these two paragraphs, it just it just I
[1:02:28] I don't know, maybe the Lord was
[1:02:29] speaking to me and it just sort of hit
[1:02:31] me the question, but where's all the
[1:02:33] signs? Where's all the signs of this
[1:02:35] taking place? The people of God are
[1:02:37] being made ready by the word of truth
[1:02:40] from the messenger to this age. So,
[1:02:42] where's the prayer lines? Where's the
[1:02:43] mighty signs and wonders? Where's the
[1:02:44] restoration of the limbs? Where's the
[1:02:47] sight coming to the blind? The dead
[1:02:50] being raised? All of these tremendous
[1:02:52] things. Don't don't don't get nervous. I
[1:02:54] can see people are like, "Brother Barry,
[1:02:55] where you going with this?" I'm not
[1:02:56] trying to say these signs aren't
[1:02:58] happening. What I am saying is they are
[1:02:59] happening, right? It's not a public
[1:03:01] show. Amen. This is not for the public.
[1:03:06] This is for the elected bride of Jesus
[1:03:08] Christ to see the power and
[1:03:11] manifestation of this spirit. It is not
[1:03:13] for the public show so we can get the
[1:03:15] the newscasters out here and and the
[1:03:18] anchor people and get the cameras and
[1:03:20] show all this stuff like people are
[1:03:22] trying to do now. It's happening now.
[1:03:25] But you know this prophet, isn't it
[1:03:27] beautiful? I was studying. I don't think
[1:03:29] I even said it on Sunday, but I I know
[1:03:31] it was before service. He said, you
[1:03:33] know, I believe, it was in that message
[1:03:35] that we were studying from on Sunday. He
[1:03:37] said, you know, I believe this so
[1:03:38] strongly that if God told me that George
[1:03:42] Washington was going to be walking
[1:03:43] around tomorrow that I would call all of
[1:03:46] the world newscasters and say, "Come and
[1:03:48] meet me at the cemetery." And you know
[1:03:51] what? If it doesn't happen, if he
[1:03:52] doesn't raise from the dead, then you
[1:03:53] can put that sign on me and call me a
[1:03:55] false prophet and and parade me around.
[1:03:58] But it's not for a public show.
[1:04:01] It just I don't know why it just hit me.
[1:04:04] Where's all the signs? We are the signs,
[1:04:07] brothers and sisters, for us to live in
[1:04:09] this age and still be able to fellowship
[1:04:12] around this word and still have a hunger
[1:04:13] and a thirst for righteousness and still
[1:04:15] desire more and more and want to get
[1:04:18] together and fellowship and want to get
[1:04:20] together and praise the Lord. What is
[1:04:22] that? That is the greatest sign that
[1:04:24] could ever happen to this age. That's
[1:04:27] the spirit of Christ.
[1:04:30] But the people of God are being made
[1:04:32] ready by the word of truth from the
[1:04:36] messenger to this
[1:04:37] age. In her will be the fullness of
[1:04:41] Pentecost. For the spirit will bring the
[1:04:44] people right back to where they were at
[1:04:47] the
[1:04:48] beginning. Now I I think this is
[1:04:50] beautiful. I feel like I could just
[1:04:51] preach a whole sermon on that one
[1:04:53] sentence right there. Because it's not
[1:04:55] William Mryiam Brham that brings the
[1:04:58] people back. It's the spirit that brings
[1:05:01] the people back. William Mariam Brham
[1:05:04] simply gets them to the spirit.
[1:05:07] So there is a consummation of the
[1:05:10] marriage. It's not just getting around
[1:05:12] the spirit and fellowshipping with the
[1:05:15] spirit. It's becoming one with the
[1:05:17] spirit. And outside of that, we're just
[1:05:21] going to be
[1:05:22] deceived. In her will be the fullness of
[1:05:26] Pentecost. Not the Pentecostal
[1:05:28] Assemblies of Canada or of the world,
[1:05:31] but the experience. Pentecost is an
[1:05:34] experience. It is not a denomination as
[1:05:37] much as many people would like it to be
[1:05:39] that way. That whole initial evidence of
[1:05:41] the Holy Ghost being able to speak in
[1:05:43] tongues, the prophet of God, the
[1:05:45] prophetic utterance to this age said
[1:05:47] that is not actually a sign of of of
[1:05:49] blessing. That's a sign of destruction,
[1:05:52] of impending doom. The handwriting is on
[1:05:56] the wall. That's what that speaking in
[1:05:58] tongues meant. Just like the feast of
[1:06:01] Beltazar, the handwriting was on the
[1:06:03] wall. And when that happened, suddenly
[1:06:05] the king that was drunk, he got pretty
[1:06:07] sober. so sober his knees started
[1:06:10] knocking together. Why was that? Because
[1:06:13] judgment struck him in his house and he
[1:06:17] was able to know. He knew it before he
[1:06:19] even had the interpretation. Isn't that
[1:06:20] beautiful? And that's the way the world
[1:06:22] is today. There's a lot of fear in this
[1:06:24] world. And the reason there's fear is
[1:06:26] because people don't have this Holy
[1:06:28] Ghost in their
[1:06:30] life. Ever learning, never able to come
[1:06:33] to the knowledge of the truth. But
[1:06:36] carrying on here, Joel chapter 2:es 23-
[1:06:43] 26. Sorry, I jumped ahead. I'll just
[1:06:46] pick up that last sentence there. He
[1:06:47] said, "In her will be the fullness of
[1:06:49] Pentecost, for the spirit will bring the
[1:06:51] people right back to where they were at
[1:06:53] the beginning." That is thus saith the
[1:06:56] Lord. Isn't that beautiful? It is thus
[1:06:59] saith the Lord. For that is what Joel
[1:07:02] 2:23-26 said. Be ye glad then, you
[1:07:04] children of Zion, and rejoice in the
[1:07:06] Lord your God. For he hath given you the
[1:07:09] former rain moderately, and will he will
[1:07:12] cause to come down for you the rain, the
[1:07:16] former rain and the latter rain in the
[1:07:20] first month. And the floors shall be
[1:07:22] full of wheat, and the fats shall
[1:07:25] overflow with wine and oil. And I will
[1:07:30] restore to you the years that the locust
[1:07:33] hath eaten, the canker worm, and the
[1:07:36] caterpillar, and the palmer worm, my
[1:07:39] great army, which I sent among you. And
[1:07:43] ye shall eat in plenty, and be
[1:07:46] satisfied, and praise the name of the
[1:07:49] Lord your God. How many tonight could
[1:07:52] say that we eat in plenty and and that
[1:07:55] we're satisfied? We are sufficiently
[1:07:57] impressed with the word that's in our
[1:07:59] midst. And it gives us the ability to
[1:08:01] praise the name of our God that had
[1:08:04] dealt wondrously with you. Yes, sir. And
[1:08:08] my people shall never be ashamed.
[1:08:11] What a tremendous thing it is. It's so
[1:08:14] beautiful the way he explains this in
[1:08:16] here. You know, before we go too far, I
[1:08:19] just I just wanted to say this. You
[1:08:21] know, I I just couldn't help but think
[1:08:22] about it when I was talking about, you
[1:08:24] know, where's all the signs when when
[1:08:26] brother Bradam talks about the the end
[1:08:29] of the evil and and and the Judas people
[1:08:32] call them that way and and how Jesus
[1:08:34] when he comes back, he'll destroy them
[1:08:36] all with the brightness of his coming
[1:08:38] and their end will be the lake of fire.
[1:08:39] But what about the true seed? It will
[1:08:41] happen just as we have said. The people
[1:08:43] of God are being made ready by the word
[1:08:45] of truth from the messenger to this age.
[1:08:48] Now, I I I just can't help but think
[1:08:50] that it's the spirit of God that that
[1:08:52] leads us and guides us. But it took me
[1:08:54] right back to a real special portion of
[1:08:58] this of this book. And uh I I just I
[1:09:02] preached on it a little while ago. And
[1:09:04] uh I don't know if I preached on it
[1:09:06] here. I can't even remember. It
[1:09:08] sometimes just blurs a little bit. But,
[1:09:10] you know, talking out of the Pergamian
[1:09:13] church age, I don't want to make anybody
[1:09:15] groan tonight, but I just can't get my
[1:09:17] my head away from pick up your pen and
[1:09:20] write because it's a message from God,
[1:09:22] the Holy Ghost, directly to his bride,
[1:09:25] his wife, to be the one who will
[1:09:27] actually be the one that has the mind of
[1:09:30] Christ. He said that she has the mind of
[1:09:32] Christ. We know all about that. But what
[1:09:34] I want to get into is at at at the
[1:09:37] latter part of it. He says, "Now let us
[1:09:39] stand like Joshua and Caleb. Our
[1:09:42] promised land is coming into sight even
[1:09:44] as theirs did." Now Joshua means Jehovah
[1:09:46] savior and he represents the end time
[1:09:48] leader that will come to the church even
[1:09:50] as Paul came as the original church
[1:09:53] leader. Caleb represents those that
[1:09:56] stayed true with Joshua. Remember
[1:09:58] brother Brandham, he said it very
[1:09:59] clearly that there is a prophet in the
[1:10:02] land and that prophet is not William,
[1:10:04] Mary Brandham. He's gone off the scene.
[1:10:06] So who's the prophet in the land? The
[1:10:08] prophet, the true prophet in the land is
[1:10:10] the Holy Ghost. He says that very
[1:10:13] clearly in the message. He says the Holy
[1:10:15] Ghost is the prophet in the land. He
[1:10:17] says it that the two of us won't be
[1:10:18] standing here at the same time. God
[1:10:20] won't share his glory with
[1:10:22] anyone. He came to do the introduction.
[1:10:25] So when we talk about this Joshua,
[1:10:27] remember we talked about this Joshua
[1:10:30] Jehovah savior, the Holy Ghost who is
[1:10:32] here now and Caleb being the church. I
[1:10:36] just wanted to to bring this to our
[1:10:38] remembrance. You know he says remember
[1:10:40] God had started Israel as a virgin with
[1:10:42] his word but they wanted something
[1:10:45] different. And remember so did Eve just
[1:10:48] one word off right? Just one word
[1:10:51] off. So did the last day church. Notice
[1:10:55] how God did not move Israel or let her
[1:10:58] go into the promised land until it was
[1:11:00] his own appointed
[1:11:03] time. I think that is one of the
[1:11:06] greatest tests of the character of the
[1:11:09] church of the living God in the day in
[1:11:11] which we live is to wait upon the Lord.
[1:11:15] We know his promises in his word. We
[1:11:18] know who we are and what we're raised up
[1:11:20] for. But many times you have that spirit
[1:11:23] saying, "Where's the signs? Where's the
[1:11:25] wonders? Where's the mighty miracles?
[1:11:26] And if it's not happening, then what's
[1:11:28] wrong with me in my life?" That's not
[1:11:30] the measuring stick. Isn't it beautiful?
[1:11:32] Brother Brandham, he says, "Away with
[1:11:35] experience as the plum line. Get rid of
[1:11:37] that idea and get yourself into the
[1:11:40] word." When we can take the word and we
[1:11:41] know that we'll stay with the word even
[1:11:43] if it takes our own hideoff. I have to
[1:11:45] subject myself to the word, brothers and
[1:11:47] sisters. If we're willing to take the
[1:11:49] word above all of our thinking, all of
[1:11:50] our tradition, all of our teaching, just
[1:11:52] put that word first. That is what will
[1:11:55] do it. And the devil wants to make it
[1:11:58] one way or the other. Ultra religious.
[1:12:00] We've got all the spiritual signs and
[1:12:01] wonders over here. And then we've got
[1:12:03] the other people. They don't care.
[1:12:04] Whatever. Forget about church. It's a
[1:12:06] waste of time. But you know, there's a
[1:12:09] highway and there's a way. And that way
[1:12:13] is the way of holiness. The only way
[1:12:16] that we're going to have any holiness in
[1:12:18] our life is to have Christ inside of us,
[1:12:21] not just being a part or affiliated, but
[1:12:24] it's got to be at his own appointed
[1:12:26] time. We cannot just wave our wand. We
[1:12:29] can't just go on our knees and pray and
[1:12:31] make him do anything.
[1:12:33] We can bring our prayers and our
[1:12:35] supplications to him and say, "Thank
[1:12:37] you, Lord, for doing your will. Let your
[1:12:40] will be done in this situation." and
[1:12:43] watch him come on the scene and do it
[1:12:45] his way and then just give him thanks.
[1:12:48] When we bring our needs, give them to
[1:12:50] him and then praise him for them. He
[1:12:52] will bring them to pass at his own
[1:12:55] appointed time. And he goes on to say
[1:12:57] here, now the people might have put
[1:13:00] pressure on Joshua, the leader, and
[1:13:02] remember, we're talking about the Holy
[1:13:04] Ghost here. The people might have put
[1:13:05] pressure on Joshua, the leader. I want
[1:13:08] to say it tonight. The Holy Ghost, the
[1:13:10] leader. People might want to put
[1:13:11] pressure on him and say, "The land is
[1:13:13] ours. Let's go and take it.
[1:13:16] Joshua, you're all through. You must
[1:13:19] have lost your commission." You know,
[1:13:20] maybe there's something wrong. Maybe we
[1:13:22] just don't have the Holy Ghost in our
[1:13:23] midst. Maybe maybe we're off somewhere.
[1:13:26] Something isn't really right if we're
[1:13:28] not seeing the mighty signs and wonders
[1:13:30] away with experience as our measuring
[1:13:33] tool. We need to make sure that we're in
[1:13:35] the word, that we're on the word.
[1:13:38] That is the difference.
[1:13:40] You haven't lost your commission,
[1:13:42] brothers and sisters. And I think that's
[1:13:44] really the point that I I felt impressed
[1:13:45] to say. We have not lost our commission.
[1:13:48] We have got our commission. We're able
[1:13:50] to stay with this word. So many people
[1:13:52] won't even hear the word, let alone come
[1:13:54] and and listen to it for a little while.
[1:13:56] Many people will come and listen to it
[1:13:58] for a little while, but if they're not
[1:14:00] truly elected, it'll burn them up. They
[1:14:03] can't handle it. We haven't lost our
[1:14:05] commission. But he says this, the people
[1:14:08] would say that to Joshua, you're all
[1:14:10] through. You You must have lost your
[1:14:11] commission. We're not seeing mighty
[1:14:12] signs and wonders right now. You don't
[1:14:14] have the power you used to have. Could
[1:14:17] you imagine that? We talked about this
[1:14:18] when we read this. Saying that to God,
[1:14:21] don't you care? Don't you know where I'm
[1:14:23] at in my life? Don't you know my trials,
[1:14:25] my
[1:14:26] struggles? If anybody knows our trials
[1:14:29] and our struggles, I would think it's
[1:14:30] God. No. If anybody does, we're just
[1:14:34] realizing it. We're just recognizing it.
[1:14:36] But what is it that's brought us this
[1:14:38] far? You know that song, Amazing Grace.
[1:14:40] The prophet said, "I'm going to be
[1:14:41] singing that someday out my
[1:14:44] B." Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound.
[1:14:48] My through many dangers, toils, and
[1:14:50] snares. I have already come. We know
[1:14:54] that he'll take us all the way.
[1:14:58] He hasn't lost his commission.
[1:15:01] He hasn't lost it. Nope. Amen.
[1:15:04] for people to say that you don't have
[1:15:05] the power you used to have. Don't look
[1:15:08] at people. Don't look at churches. Just
[1:15:10] look to Christ. Look to the word. You
[1:15:13] used to hear from God and know the will
[1:15:15] of God and act quickly. Something is
[1:15:17] wrong with you. What's the will of God?
[1:15:21] His
[1:15:22] word. It's his word. It's not signs and
[1:15:26] wonders. But Joshua was a God-scent
[1:15:28] prophet and he knew the promises of God.
[1:15:31] So, he waited for them. Amen. He waited
[1:15:34] for a clear-cut decision from God. And
[1:15:38] when the time came to move,
[1:15:41] God placed full leadership in Joshua's
[1:15:43] hands because he stayed with the word.
[1:15:46] God could trust Joshua, but not the
[1:15:49] others. Now, just just to underline
[1:15:52] this, so brother Barry's not going
[1:15:53] crazy. Brother Bradom says this here. I
[1:15:55] think it's the Holy Ghost, Brother
[1:15:56] Bradom. So, it will repeat in this end
[1:15:59] day. Same problem, same pressures.
[1:16:03] So don't think you've lost your
[1:16:05] commission, brothers and sisters, if
[1:16:07] you're not seeing signs and wonders.
[1:16:10] Just commit the need to God and trust
[1:16:12] him and go forwards and say that I this
[1:16:16] is where I want to preach now because
[1:16:18] this is where I went to with this whole
[1:16:19] Joshua commission. It's actually in the
[1:16:21] morning Bible study and I have to try
[1:16:22] and keep myself quiet because it's
[1:16:24] really early in the morning and family's
[1:16:26] still sleeping. But you know what is it
[1:16:28] that was Joshua that that that Joshua
[1:16:31] and Caleb, what was it with them? There
[1:16:33] came a point in time where they helped
[1:16:35] all their brethren to get position in
[1:16:37] the promised land, right? But then
[1:16:39] Caleb, he said, you know, I I've helped
[1:16:42] everyone and I need a little bit of
[1:16:44] inheritance myself now. And you know, I
[1:16:46] I know that I'm 40 years older than when
[1:16:49] we first came into this land. I was 40
[1:16:52] years old. My goodness. But you know, I
[1:16:55] know that I'm just as strong today as I
[1:16:57] was then. And you know what was it that
[1:17:00] gave him that strength? He knew that God
[1:17:02] said when all the 10
[1:17:04] spies defied God to his face, how did
[1:17:08] they how did they do that? They did it
[1:17:10] to his prophet. That's how they defied
[1:17:13] God to his face. They totally said to
[1:17:15] his prophet, you know, we can't do it.
[1:17:17] Even though the prophet had led them
[1:17:18] out, he said it. They said it. 10 the 10
[1:17:21] elders, they said it to the church. I
[1:17:23] shouldn't preach, but they
[1:17:26] did. But you know, those two, Joshua and
[1:17:28] Caleb, they were able to go in to see
[1:17:29] the promised land, just to put it in a
[1:17:32] nutshell, to simplify it. And why was
[1:17:34] that? Because they were of another
[1:17:36] spirit. Caleb was not of another spirit.
[1:17:40] And he was able to go back to that place
[1:17:42] where God recognized that for him in his
[1:17:44] life. And I think we need to be able to
[1:17:46] do that too, brothers and sisters.
[1:17:47] Sometimes we can live in the age in
[1:17:50] which we live in. It's dark and it's
[1:17:51] gloomy. I I deal with this black and
[1:17:53] white weather outside. This this going
[1:17:55] into springtime now out of the winter
[1:17:57] and it really affects me in my person. I
[1:18:00] I feel down. And you know, it doesn't
[1:18:03] matter because the sun is shining
[1:18:05] somewhere. But you know, sometimes we
[1:18:07] just need to remind ourselves about
[1:18:10] what's good in our lives and and what
[1:18:12] the goodness is of God. And we know that
[1:18:14] Caleb, he did that. He wanted his
[1:18:16] inheritance. And he said, "Hey, I
[1:18:18] remember that one time in my life where
[1:18:21] God told me that I was of another
[1:18:22] spirit. And because of that, I'm able to
[1:18:25] go in and have my inheritance. And I
[1:18:27] haven't found it yet. I've helped
[1:18:28] everyone else find theirs, but where's
[1:18:30] my inheritance, Lord?" I think sometimes
[1:18:33] we need to be able to do that. And he
[1:18:36] will let us have those times. He will
[1:18:38] absolutely ensure that we have those
[1:18:41] times along the way where we can say, "I
[1:18:43] know that was God. Nobody else needs to
[1:18:46] know it but you. And when you have those
[1:18:48] times, you can go back to him and say,
[1:18:50] "My, remember that time?" I do. And you
[1:18:53] know, God says it in his word. I
[1:18:56] remembered my
[1:18:57] promise. Which means he thinks
[1:19:00] back somehow. I don't know how. I can't
[1:19:03] explain it, but he remembers. The word
[1:19:05] says he does. I remembered my promise.
[1:19:07] Brother Brandham said it when he was
[1:19:09] going to shoot the deer. He could have
[1:19:10] shot the deer. Remember the story? And
[1:19:13] he never did.
[1:19:15] And God said to him, "I remembered my
[1:19:18] promise. Do you remember yours?" My,
[1:19:22] what a thing that is. Goodness, just
[1:19:25] tremendous. Joshua and Caleb were of
[1:19:27] another spirit.
[1:19:29] That's what gave him the ability to make
[1:19:32] the difference. And you know, the people
[1:19:34] of God are being made ready by the word
[1:19:37] of truth from the messenger of the age.
[1:19:39] And it gives them the ability to have
[1:19:41] another spirit. In her will be the
[1:19:44] fullness of Pentecost, another spirit.
[1:19:47] For the spirit will bring the people
[1:19:49] right back to where they were at the
[1:19:52] beginning. That's thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:19:54] It's thus saith the Lord. For that's
[1:19:56] what Joel 2 23-26 says. We won't read it
[1:20:00] again. I'll just carry on with what he
[1:20:01] he was saying now because I can see
[1:20:03] we're getting short on time here. But
[1:20:06] we're almost done.
[1:20:08] We've got uh basically two and a half
[1:20:11] more pages. He goes on to say, now it
[1:20:13] says God is going to restore. The
[1:20:16] Lutheran age did not restore the church.
[1:20:20] It started a reformation. The Wesleyan
[1:20:23] age did not restore. The Pentecostal age
[1:20:26] did not restore. But God has to restore
[1:20:30] for he cannot deny his word.
[1:20:34] This is not the resurrection of the
[1:20:37] church. Isn't that beautiful? It's a
[1:20:40] restoration.
[1:20:42] Many times people are saying, "We're
[1:20:44] going to have a great revival, great
[1:20:45] revival. It's going to be a resurrection
[1:20:47] of what the other churches used to be."
[1:20:49] And you see all the worship services and
[1:20:52] the worship teams and all this stuff.
[1:20:56] That's not the church of the living God.
[1:20:58] No, it's a restoration of his spirit in
[1:21:02] the people in the church. And we know,
[1:21:04] we read about it. He said it so clearly
[1:21:07] that there is a church, but then there's
[1:21:10] a church that's called out of the
[1:21:12] church, and that's the truly
[1:21:15] elect. It's it's an amazing thing to
[1:21:17] think about, but it's a restoration of
[1:21:19] his spirit. God will take the church
[1:21:21] right back to
[1:21:22] Pentecost of the beginning. Now notice
[1:21:26] in verse 25, it tells why we need a
[1:21:31] restoration. The locust, the cankerworm,
[1:21:34] caterpillar, and palmer worm have eaten
[1:21:37] all but the root and a small bit of the
[1:21:40] stem. Now we are told that all these
[1:21:43] insects are all one and the same in
[1:21:47] different
[1:21:47] stages. That is right.
[1:21:50] They are the antichrist spirit that
[1:21:53] manifested in
[1:21:56] organization that manifested in
[1:21:59] organization, denomination, and false
[1:22:02] doctrine through the
[1:22:05] ages. And that poor little root and
[1:22:08] stock is going to be restored.
[1:22:12] God isn't going to plant a new church,
[1:22:15] but he's going to bring his original
[1:22:17] planting back to original seed. He's
[1:22:22] doing it as stated in verse 23, by
[1:22:27] teaching or former
[1:22:29] reign. Next will come the harvest reign
[1:22:33] or rapturing faith.
[1:22:36] Rapturing
[1:22:38] faith is the latter rain. That's
[1:22:41] beautiful, isn't it? Thus, at this very
[1:22:43] moment, we are in the complete
[1:22:45] fulfillment of Matthew 24:24.
[1:22:50] For there shall arise false Christs and
[1:22:52] false prophets, and shall show great
[1:22:56] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[1:22:59] were possible, they shall deceive the
[1:23:02] very elect. Now, that can be a very
[1:23:05] comforting scripture or a fearful one.
[1:23:09] Outside of the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:11] Ghost, it's a fearful one because how
[1:23:13] will you ever know the difference? I
[1:23:15] remember growing up and as I mentioned
[1:23:17] going to the Baptist church and seeing
[1:23:19] this movie about the the whole uh the
[1:23:23] end times, the rapture being left behind
[1:23:25] and thinking about all these other times
[1:23:28] you hear people talk about there being
[1:23:29] an antichrist and a beast and all the
[1:23:32] false prophet and all of this gloomy,
[1:23:35] spooky sounding stuff, but nobody ever
[1:23:38] really being able to explain it really
[1:23:40] clearly. and and to think about it that
[1:23:43] you know there's a time coming where if
[1:23:45] you don't have a certain understanding
[1:23:48] that you will be deceived and that's
[1:23:50] what the word of God says and I know
[1:23:52] that struck a lot of fear in me as a
[1:23:54] child and I trust that tonight nobody
[1:23:56] has that kind of fear because we have
[1:23:59] the understanding we've been given a
[1:24:01] very clear dis description of of what's
[1:24:05] going to take place and if it were
[1:24:08] possible the very elect would be
[1:24:10] deceived D, but with his spirit, it's
[1:24:12] impossible to deceive the very elect.
[1:24:15] And outside of being very elect,
[1:24:18] unfortunately, I don't know how many
[1:24:19] people are going to have the true
[1:24:20] baptism of the Holy Spirit. There's
[1:24:23] going to be a lot of people with the
[1:24:24] anointing of the Holy Spirit that will
[1:24:26] have mighty signs and wonders. The rain
[1:24:29] falls on the just and the unjust. And I
[1:24:32] believe it's Hebrews chapter 6 that
[1:24:34] brother Brandham brings that from.
[1:24:36] There's going to be a rain that comes
[1:24:38] and there's just and there's unjust.
[1:24:40] There's weeds and there's and there's
[1:24:42] wheat. When you plant a garden,
[1:24:44] everything that's in that garden, all of
[1:24:46] the seeds rejoice at the watering. They
[1:24:49] all grow and they all
[1:24:52] rejoice. And one's a seed that you've
[1:24:55] planted that you want and another one is
[1:24:57] a seed that was there and you don't
[1:25:00] want. And the one that you don't want,
[1:25:03] you're not going to go in necessarily
[1:25:04] and tear them all up. while the other
[1:25:07] ones are growing. The word of God says
[1:25:09] to let them all grow together, lest you
[1:25:12] actually damage the wheat when you're
[1:25:14] pulling up the weeds. But you know,
[1:25:16] there's not going to be deception to the
[1:25:19] truly elect. And it's not because they
[1:25:21] have anything special other than the
[1:25:23] seal of God in their life. And I'm not
[1:25:26] I'm not discounting that in any way. I'm
[1:25:28] just saying they're ordinary human
[1:25:29] beings with the Holy Ghost in their life
[1:25:32] because God for ordained for them to be
[1:25:34] the truly elect. But we're just ordinary
[1:25:37] people. Many times we're the
[1:25:39] underdogs. The really successful ones
[1:25:42] are the ones that are actually going the
[1:25:45] other
[1:25:46] way. But anyways, he goes on to say,
[1:25:49] "And who is it that shall attempt to
[1:25:51] deceive the very elect?
[1:25:53] Why the spirit of antichrist in the
[1:25:57] false anointed ones of this last day. So
[1:26:01] this is where I have to say brothers and
[1:26:03] sisters, we could even be in the church
[1:26:05] of the living God. We can be in a
[1:26:07] message church, but you know this
[1:26:10] antichrist spirit, he likes to come to a
[1:26:13] true message
[1:26:14] church. And you know what? He likes to
[1:26:16] actually come around the church of the
[1:26:18] living God. He's not interested in going
[1:26:22] after those people that aren't following
[1:26:24] the truth. He is very, very keenly
[1:26:28] interested in knowing who the true
[1:26:31] believers really are because he can't
[1:26:34] touch them. But the ones who are
[1:26:36] associating with them, who haven't
[1:26:38] really gone on to receive the true
[1:26:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost, they're the
[1:26:42] ones that can be shaken. And those are
[1:26:44] his targets. That's why as parents we
[1:26:47] have got to be ultra careful with our
[1:26:50] families, our children. We are the ones
[1:26:54] responsible for their well-being. And
[1:26:57] you know, sometimes it can be a movie,
[1:26:59] sometimes it can be a song, sometimes it
[1:27:02] can be an association, sometimes it can
[1:27:04] be where they go. We don't know
[1:27:07] necessarily what happens when we're not
[1:27:08] there. We need to make sure that we're
[1:27:11] doing everything we can to apply the
[1:27:13] token to our homes. Preaching to myself
[1:27:15] here. I know it because we are the Holy
[1:27:18] Ghost for our children until the age of
[1:27:21] accountability. We are the ones forming
[1:27:24] the wall of prayer around our children
[1:27:27] or at least we should be. But the
[1:27:30] antichrist spirit is going to try very
[1:27:33] diligently to deceive the very elected.
[1:27:37] That's why I think it's so important,
[1:27:38] brother Brandham. He says it, you know,
[1:27:40] show me your people and I'll tell you
[1:27:41] who you are. Amen. Birds of a feather.
[1:27:44] They flock together. The truly elected
[1:27:47] want to hang out with truly elected. We
[1:27:50] want to talk about the word of God.
[1:27:52] We're not interested in slandering and
[1:27:54] murmuring. That does nothing except for
[1:27:57] show what we
[1:27:59] are. He goes on to say, "And who is it
[1:28:02] that shall attempt to deceive the very
[1:28:04] elect? Why, the spirit of Antichrist in
[1:28:06] the false anointed ones of this last
[1:28:08] day? These false ones have already come
[1:28:11] in Jesus' name, claiming they have been
[1:28:14] anointed of God for the last day. They
[1:28:17] are the false messiah's anointed ones.
[1:28:21] They claim that they are
[1:28:24] prophets. But are they one with the
[1:28:28] word?
[1:28:30] Never. They have added to it or taken
[1:28:32] from it. I say, Lord, let us never add
[1:28:35] to it or take from it.
[1:28:38] Never. No one denies that the spirit of
[1:28:41] God manifesting in gifts is upon them.
[1:28:45] You hear what he's saying here? You hear
[1:28:48] that? No one denies that the spirit of
[1:28:51] God manifesting in gifts is upon
[1:28:54] them. But like Balum, they all have
[1:28:58] their programs. They make their appeal
[1:29:01] for money, exercise
[1:29:03] gifts, but deny the word.
[1:29:07] or not deny it, just bypass it for fear
[1:29:12] that a controversy might diminish their
[1:29:14] chances for greater gain.
[1:29:17] My goodness. Just build an overpass
[1:29:19] around the word. Keep the word, but just
[1:29:22] build another way around it,
[1:29:25] right? No one denies that the spirit of
[1:29:28] God manifesting in gifts is upon them.
[1:29:30] But like Balum, they all have their
[1:29:32] programs, make their appeal for money,
[1:29:34] exercise gifts, but deny the word or
[1:29:36] bypass it for fear that a controversy
[1:29:39] might diminish their chances for greater
[1:29:41] gain. Yet they preach salvation and
[1:29:44] deliverance through the power of God.
[1:29:47] Just like Judas with a ministry imparted
[1:29:50] by
[1:29:51] Christ. But because they are wrong
[1:29:54] seed,
[1:29:56] consequently they have a wrong spirit
[1:29:59] motivating them.
[1:30:01] Religious. Oh my. They outshine the
[1:30:05] elect in effort and
[1:30:08] zeal. But it is le
[1:30:10] oysian not of Christ. for it looks for
[1:30:14] big crowds, big programs,
[1:30:18] and startling signs amongst them. Some
[1:30:22] people, they look for
[1:30:24] followers. They look for a
[1:30:26] following. They preach the second coming
[1:30:29] of
[1:30:30] Christ. Oh my. But deny the advent of
[1:30:34] Malachi 4 and six. Right?
[1:30:39] They deny the advent of the prophet
[1:30:42] messenger, though in power and signs and
[1:30:45] true revelation, he eclipses them all,
[1:30:47] doesn't he? Didn't he? Isn't it
[1:30:51] interesting to think that scripture lays
[1:30:53] there, right in the middle of the Bible,
[1:30:56] the last words of the Old Testament,
[1:30:59] just before the New. Maybe it's because
[1:31:01] it's right there in in the New
[1:31:03] Testament. It's just overlooked. It's
[1:31:04] easy to overlook it. Isn't it
[1:31:06] interesting to look at the old covenant
[1:31:08] and the new covenant, the transition?
[1:31:10] There's a time coming. There is a time
[1:31:12] coming. And I'm sure most scholars, if
[1:31:14] not all of them, would agree, there's a
[1:31:15] time coming where that scripture has to
[1:31:17] come to
[1:31:19] pass. When is it? When is it going to
[1:31:23] happen? And we know that it's already
[1:31:24] happened. I know that. But I just think
[1:31:27] it's amazing how people would try and
[1:31:28] put it off and say that we don't know.
[1:31:30] We can't explain. If we would just take
[1:31:33] a look at the scripture, take a look at
[1:31:34] the word. I know it's not for everyone.
[1:31:37] He goes on to say, "Ah, yes, this false
[1:31:40] spirit in the last day is so close to
[1:31:42] the
[1:31:43] real, not out
[1:31:45] there. So close to the real can be
[1:31:49] distinguished only by its deviation from
[1:31:52] the
[1:31:54] word. And whenever it is caught in being
[1:31:58] anti-word, it falls back on the one
[1:32:00] argument we've already shown to be
[1:32:02] false. We get results, don't we? We have
[1:32:05] to be of God.
[1:32:09] Now, before we close, I want to bring
[1:32:11] this thought. All along, we've been
[1:32:13] talking about the seed of wheat being
[1:32:16] buried, then sending up two
[1:32:19] chuts, then a tassel, then the true ear.
[1:32:24] This might make some wonder if we said
[1:32:26] that the Lutheran didn't have the Holy
[1:32:30] Spirit just because they taught
[1:32:33] basically
[1:32:35] justification. You know, for me, I'll
[1:32:37] say this. This is where I really started
[1:32:39] to dial in and lock in on on this guy
[1:32:42] being prophetic, this guy being a
[1:32:44] prophet of God. Th this is what started
[1:32:46] to cement it for me because here he's
[1:32:48] not slandering them. He's not slandering
[1:32:51] them at all.
[1:32:53] This might make some wonder if we said
[1:32:55] that the Lutheran didn't have the Holy
[1:32:56] Spirit just because they taught
[1:32:58] basically justification. It might make
[1:33:00] some wonder about the Methodist etc. No
[1:33:03] sir, we're not saying that. We are not
[1:33:06] talking about the individuals or the
[1:33:09] people but the
[1:33:11] age. Every age had elect in it. Luther
[1:33:15] had the spirit of God, but his age was
[1:33:19] not the age of full restoration by
[1:33:22] another outpouring like in the
[1:33:25] beginning. It was the same with Wesley.
[1:33:28] Now, I love how he brings this in here
[1:33:30] and he gives some some other examples
[1:33:33] from the world aside from just the
[1:33:35] church age messengers that he brought.
[1:33:38] He's saying these men had the Holy
[1:33:40] Ghost. That's right. It's amazing. It
[1:33:44] was the same with Wesley, Booth, Knox,
[1:33:46] Whitfield, Brainard, Jonathan, Edwards,
[1:33:49] Mueller, etc. Surely they were filled
[1:33:52] with the Holy
[1:33:54] Ghost. Yes, they certainly were. But the
[1:33:58] age in which each lived was not the age
[1:34:01] of restoration. Neither was any age but
[1:34:04] this last age, the age of complete
[1:34:07] blackout in
[1:34:09] apostasy where the devil could be called
[1:34:11] the god of this age and and be able to
[1:34:16] set up altars all over the place. So
[1:34:19] many different ways, so many different
[1:34:21] techniques for him to be acknowledged
[1:34:23] and recognized all over the world now.
[1:34:27] So loud and proud. It's everywhere.
[1:34:31] It's just beautiful though to see this.
[1:34:34] He says, "This is the age of apostasy
[1:34:37] and this is the age of restoration. It
[1:34:40] is the
[1:34:42] age, excuse me, of the finished cycle.
[1:34:45] With this, it's all
[1:34:48] over. This is the age of apostasy and
[1:34:51] this is the age of restoration." It's a
[1:34:53] paradox, isn't it? It is the age of the
[1:34:57] finished cycle. With this, it's all
[1:34:59] over. So, we conclude the seven church
[1:35:02] ages. I'll bring call the musicians.
[1:35:04] We're at 9:00. So, we conclude the seven
[1:35:07] church ages saying only what the spirit
[1:35:10] said to each age. He that hath an ear,
[1:35:13] let him hear what the spirit saith to
[1:35:16] the
[1:35:17] churches. It's so beautiful. It's not
[1:35:19] just what any one man said to the
[1:35:21] churches. Let's hear what the spirit
[1:35:24] saith to the churches. I sincerely
[1:35:26] believe that the spirit of God has been
[1:35:28] speaking to us, not only teaching us the
[1:35:31] truths of the ages, but he has been
[1:35:34] faithfully dealing with our hearts that
[1:35:36] they may turn to him. Maybe stand with
[1:35:39] us as we as we close. That is the reason
[1:35:42] for all preaching and teaching. For it
[1:35:45] is in the preaching and teaching of the
[1:35:48] word that the sheep hear the voice of
[1:35:51] God and follow him.
[1:35:55] And isn't that the the desire of every
[1:35:57] single preacher and every single
[1:36:00] teacher, every single evangelist and and
[1:36:05] missionary to bring the word of God to
[1:36:08] people's hearts so that they have the
[1:36:10] ability to hear his voice and follow
[1:36:12] him.
[1:36:14] He says, "Not for one moment do I bring
[1:36:16] a message to the people that they may
[1:36:19] follow me or join my
[1:36:21] church or start some fellowship and
[1:36:24] organization." I wonder if some people
[1:36:27] have ever read
[1:36:29] this. I do. Sometimes you have to wonder
[1:36:32] about some things or start some
[1:36:35] fellowship or organization. I have never
[1:36:37] done that and will never and and will
[1:36:40] not do that now. Sorry. I have no
[1:36:42] interest in those things. But I do have
[1:36:44] an interest in the things of God and
[1:36:46] people. And if I can accomplish just one
[1:36:49] thing, I will be
[1:36:51] satisfied. That one thing is to see
[1:36:54] established a true spiritual
[1:36:57] relationship between God and men,
[1:37:00] wherein men become new creations in
[1:37:02] Christ, filled with his spirit and live
[1:37:06] according to his word. I would invite,
[1:37:10] plead and warn all to hear his voice at
[1:37:14] this time and yield our lives completely
[1:37:17] to him. Even as I trust in my heart that
[1:37:20] I have given my all to
[1:37:23] him. Could we say that tonight? I trust
[1:37:26] in my heart that I have given my all to
[1:37:29] him.
[1:37:31] If we haven't, brothers and sisters, I
[1:37:33] just want to say it's not too late. We
[1:37:37] can say I desire Lord to just give my
[1:37:40] all to you. He says, "God bless you and
[1:37:44] may his coming rejoice your heart."
[1:37:47] God richly bless you. That's the
[1:37:49] exposition of the seven church ages the
[1:37:52] first time here. Let's just bow in
[1:37:54] prayer.
[1:37:56] Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[1:37:58] tonight we thank you for this
[1:38:01] Lord, we thank you for this word that
[1:38:04] we've read, the the words in this book
[1:38:07] which is authored, I believe, by you
[1:38:11] through
[1:38:12] a messenger, one of the seven, Lord,
[1:38:15] that you talk about in the beginning of
[1:38:17] the book of
[1:38:18] Revelation. Lord Jesus, this this word
[1:38:21] that we've read in this book is a lot of
[1:38:24] your word. Amen. And we know that the
[1:38:28] heart of the man that you know put this
[1:38:31] book together, his desire would simply
[1:38:35] be that we would go to know you. That we
[1:38:38] would not be stuck following him. He
[1:38:42] would not want that. His desire would be
[1:38:45] fully completely for us to have that
[1:38:47] relationship with you. Lord Jesus, I
[1:38:51] pray that tonight, Father, we would all
[1:38:53] have that ability and and it would be to
[1:38:57] hear what the Spirit says unto the
[1:38:59] church. Lord, Father, we know that
[1:39:02] rapturing faith lies on the tapes. And
[1:39:04] Lord, we're supposed to take the book
[1:39:06] and to eat it up. And Father, we try and
[1:39:09] do that as much as we can. And Father,
[1:39:12] tonight I I pray that each and every one
[1:39:14] of us, Lord, would be able to look in
[1:39:17] our lives and see that time and that
[1:39:20] place just like Caleb and Joshua had in
[1:39:23] their life, where they recognized, Lord,
[1:39:26] that it didn't matter about what anyone
[1:39:28] else was doing. It only mattered where
[1:39:30] they stood. And they had the ability to
[1:39:32] recognize that your word was greater
[1:39:34] than any of the problems or issues that
[1:39:37] came up along the way. And because of
[1:39:40] that, you acknowledged them and you
[1:39:42] acknowledged their hearts and you told
[1:39:44] them that they would be the only ones
[1:39:46] from that generation that would go into
[1:39:48] their inheritance. Help us, Lord Jesus,
[1:39:51] to be those ones that will cross over
[1:39:54] and go into our inheritance, Father, all
[1:39:57] the way.
[1:39:58] Let us not be stuck at at some
[1:40:01] tradition, Lord, or or some theory or
[1:40:04] idea, but Father, let us just, Lord,
[1:40:07] cast down all of our reasonings and all
[1:40:09] of our imaginations, Lord Jesus, and
[1:40:11] take every thought into the captivity of
[1:40:14] your Holy Spirit. And Lord, whatever
[1:40:16] word that you allow to come out of it,
[1:40:18] let it be unto us according to thy word,
[1:40:21] Lord. Father, Lord, we pray that you
[1:40:23] would just be with us as we go our
[1:40:25] separate ways. Thank you for this study,
[1:40:27] Lord. 62 weeks of getting together and
[1:40:30] learning more. Father, I pray that we
[1:40:33] could just continue to glean out of this
[1:40:36] study, Lord, and that we would be able
[1:40:37] to just continue to grow higher and
[1:40:40] higher in you, Father, having a greater
[1:40:42] revelation in our lives, Father, giving
[1:40:45] us a greater humility, recognizing that
[1:40:47] it's only by your grace that we're even
[1:40:49] able to understand that you sent a
[1:40:51] prophet. Oh, Father, we're so thankful,
[1:40:54] Lord. Help us to have a song in our
[1:40:56] heart, Lord, a spring in our step, and
[1:40:58] to know that the joy that you have given
[1:41:00] us, that is our strength, Lord Jesus.
[1:41:04] Father, we love you tonight, and we just
[1:41:06] want to commit each life into your
[1:41:07] hands, Lord. We pray that you would
[1:41:09] bless our prayer meeting tomorrow night,
[1:41:11] Father. Lord, we know that's the
[1:41:13] greatest weapon that you've given us,
[1:41:15] Father. Lord, the thing, the only thing
[1:41:18] that can make changes, Lord, is to
[1:41:19] gather together as brothers and sisters
[1:41:21] and Father, create a wall of prayer.
[1:41:24] Father, we just ask that you would be
[1:41:26] with us now. Be glorified in a few songs
[1:41:29] that we sing, Lord. In Jesus Christ's
[1:41:32] name we pray.
[1:41:34] Amen.
[1:41:36] Amen. Can we sing the song Ancient
[1:41:40] Words? Ancient Words.
[1:41:44] [Music]
[1:41:54] Holy word, long
[1:41:57] preserved for our
[1:42:00] walk in this
[1:42:04] world. They
[1:42:06] resound with God's own heart. Oh, let
[1:42:11] the ancient words
[1:42:15] impart. Word of
[1:42:18] God, ever
[1:42:21] true, changing
[1:42:27] me. We have
[1:42:29] come with open hearts.
[1:42:34] Let the word of God
[1:42:39] impart. Words of
[1:42:41] life. Words of
[1:42:44] hope. Give us
[1:42:47] strength. Help us
[1:42:50] cope. In this
[1:42:53] world where we roam, the word of God
[1:42:58] will guide us home.
[1:43:03] Word of
[1:43:05] God ever
[1:43:08] true. Changing
[1:43:11] me, changing
[1:43:14] you. We have come with open
[1:43:19] hearts. Oh, let the word of God impart.
[1:43:27] Holy
[1:43:28] words of our
[1:43:31] faith handed
[1:43:34] down to this
[1:43:37] age came to us through
[1:43:43] sacriice. Oh ye the faithful words of
[1:43:48] Christ.
[1:43:50] Word of
[1:43:52] God never
[1:43:55] true changing
[1:43:57] me
[1:44:02] changing God with open
[1:44:06] hearts. Oh let the word of God impart.
[1:44:15] Hallelujah. Can we sing standing on the
[1:44:18] promises of God? Amen.
