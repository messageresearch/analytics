[20:52] morning
[20:56] [Music]
[21:11] amen amen
[21:13] [Music]
[21:23] amen I was just um thinking a couple of
[21:27] days ago while just aming and whatever
[21:30] God wants us to sing today and I was
[21:32] thinking that the year is flying by
[21:34] isn't it it's it's February 2nd today it
[21:36] wasn't too long since we welcomed the
[21:38] new year and um I was thinking how are
[21:42] we progressing with our spiritual
[21:44] goals you know in in schools they assess
[21:48] students performances and at work we
[21:50] also do performance appraisals are you
[21:52] meeting expectations exceeding
[21:54] expectations are you below expectations
[21:56] or you're just just hanging there there
[21:59] and I was thinking it's a it's a time
[22:02] for Spiritual introspection um and the
[22:04] Bible admonishes us to self-reflect to
[22:06] think on our
[22:08] ways and um wherever we are today
[22:11] wherever I am today there's one thing
[22:13] sure there's room for growth there's
[22:15] room for more of God and um the Fountain
[22:19] of Living Water which is Christ has so
[22:21] much more so much more to offer there
[22:24] Higher Grounds we're going to sing this
[22:26] next song Higher Ground and there more
[22:28] of a rightful land to take back like
[22:31] Joshua like the children of Israel they
[22:33] were in the promised land but they still
[22:35] had to fight they still had more land
[22:37] more land to take and um if we can
[22:40] believe all these things and even much
[22:43] more I possible the sky is not the limit
[22:46] there are no
[22:47] limits and U I'll just read Ephesians
[22:50] 3:20 now unto him that is able to do
[22:52] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[22:54] can ask or think according to the power
[22:56] that worketh in US so let's step forward
[22:59] in
[22:59] faith I believe we all here today desire

[51:31] goodness and his Mercy my
[51:34] goodness what a tremendous thing it is
[51:38] if you have your Bibles today I'd like
[51:39] to take a scripture from John chapter
[51:44] 8 a little bit of a transition from
[51:47] where we have been in the
[51:49] past talking about the importance of
[51:52] Revelation but it truly is the
[51:54] importance of Revelation
[51:57] that will make a difference in our
[52:00] lives and not just Revelation brothers
[52:03] and sisters it's Revelation by the
[52:06] spirit exactly and not just Revelation
[52:09] by any spirit because there's a lot of
[52:11] spirits in this world and I'll tell you
[52:13] you know it but sometimes we need to say
[52:15] it there's a lot of religious Spirits in
[52:18] this
[52:20] world but it's Revelation by the Holy
[52:25] Spirit John chter 8 verse
[52:31] 31 then said Jesus to those Jews which
[52:34] believed on
[52:36] him if ye continue in my
[52:40] word then are ye my disciples
[52:44] indeed and ye shall know the truth and
[52:48] the truth shall make you
[52:52] free they answered
[52:54] him we be Abra
[52:57] seed and were never in bondage to any
[53:02] man how sayest thou ye shall be made
[53:06] free Jesus answered them verily verily
[53:10] truly
[53:11] truly I say unto
[53:14] you whosoever committeth sin is the
[53:18] servant of
[53:19] sin and the servant abideth not in the
[53:23] house forever but the son abideth ever
[53:28] amen if the sun therefore shall make you
[53:33] free ye shall be free
[53:36] indeed let's just bow one more time
[53:40] Heavenly Father Lord we pray that you
[53:42] would just allow us father to be
[53:45] free that we could see this glorious
[53:48] Liberty in our lives Lord maybe from
[53:51] just a little bit of a different
[53:52] perspective today Father maybe like
[53:54] never before and Lord we pray that
[53:57] ultimately you would have the
[53:59] preeminence in our lives we just ask
[54:02] that you would bless this word now in
[54:04] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[54:07] bless you this morning you may be
[54:10] seated certainly happy to be
[54:13] back in Calgary we had uh a wonderful
[54:17] weekend last

[54:23] brother Ed hammermeister and and the
[54:26] church Church there the Saints they send
[54:27] their greetings so God bless you uh just
[54:31] a few announcements we have a prayer
[54:32] meeting coming up on Thursday that's the
[54:35] 6th that will be here at the church and
[54:38] on the 15th which is a Saturday and the
[54:41] 16th which is a Sunday we have brother
[54:43] Cadre Diggs here we'll have a 6 PM
[54:45] service on Saturday and the regular

[55:11] have the annual General men's meeting
[55:14] and uh just a confirmation as well so we
[55:18] can begin to plan I'm going to advertise
[55:20] it as we get closer but I'm just going
[55:22] to mention it as we go uh September the
[55:25] 12th 13th and 14th we have confirmed
[55:28] brother Andrew Glover for this year so I
[55:31] know last year it was a bit of a
[55:32] struggle because it was at the end of
[55:34] the summer when I had him come and many
[55:37] people were away for one last Harrah in
[55:39] the summer and so I asked him if we
[55:42] could arrange something after everybody
[55:44] gets back to normal again so we can have
[55:46] a a full service so we have a long time
[55:49] to plan I trust that it will be a
[55:51] blessing if you desire to be here uh
[55:53] Lord willing um it should be a wonderful
[55:56] week weend of
[55:57] services and I think as we go forwards
[56:00] probably what will happen is uh it's
[56:02] going to get very busy here that weekend
[56:05] because a lot of people like to come and
[56:06] hear Brother Andrew Glover so uh Mark
[56:10] that in your calendars it's actually I
[56:12] don't know if it's on the church
[56:13] calendar but it will be if you uh desire
[56:16] to see it so any questions by all means
[56:19] just reach out just have a quick note

[56:41] update from the treasurer and uh trust

[58:55] there brothers and sisters
[58:57] please forgive me if I don't mention
[58:59] your name in any
[59:01] capacity if ever that happens it's not
[59:04] because I don't love you it's not
[59:05] because I don't pray for you it's just
[59:08] because maybe I get anxious and
[59:10] distracted and I forget that's
[59:14] all I know sometimes the devil could
[59:16] come around and say well brother never
[59:18] prayed for me while I was away or
[59:20] brother never mentioned my birthday or
[59:22] whatever that that's not the case that I
[59:25] don't actually love you and care for you
[59:27] I pray for each one by name so um moving
[59:32] forward hopefully I'll keep on top of
[59:34] this birthday thing it sounds really
[59:36] easy and it should be but I get
[59:38] distracted and nervous so anyways I
[59:41] think it's wonderful to be here today we
[59:43] uh clearly heard that I believe like
[59:46] brother Fen said we're being called a
[59:47] little higher you believe you can be
[59:50] blessed in a song
[59:51] service people can be healed in a song
[59:54] service brothers and sisters we're
[59:56] witnesses to that right here in this
[59:58] building and we know this building has
[59:59] nothing to do with it but the spirit
[1:00:01] that comes into this building with each
[1:00:02] and every member here has everything to
[1:00:04] do with it the spirit that we bring
[1:00:07] makes the difference in the services
[1:00:09] right are we working on that Spirit the
[1:00:12] night before or are we out with the
[1:00:14] world the night before it makes a
[1:00:16] difference it really does but you know I
[1:00:19] I just think it's wonderful it made me
[1:00:21] take some notes in the back when brother
[1:00:22] Fen was was expressing what God put on
[1:00:24] his heart it is is is being called
[1:00:27] higher is it in the preaching brothers
[1:00:29] and sisters is the preaching necessary
[1:00:32] to come a little higher cuz if it is I
[1:00:34] say Lord let it be we want it to go
[1:00:37] higher and I think it is because we're
[1:00:40] on a journey God wants all of us to come
[1:00:42] a little higher amen is it in the
[1:00:45] music is it in the music to come a
[1:00:47] little higher I know many people some
[1:00:50] people maybe not many would say sure it
[1:00:52] isn't the music the music program needs
[1:00:55] to get a little better
[1:00:56] but you know what happens is I've
[1:00:58] noticed is usually those comments come
[1:01:00] from the people that never play
[1:01:02] music it's interesting how that works
[1:01:05] but it's
[1:01:07] true is it in the music does that need
[1:01:09] to come a little higher is it in the
[1:01:10] preaching that come a little higher is
[1:01:12] it in the
[1:01:14] conduct does that need to come a little
[1:01:16] higher it just makes me wonder I I'm not
[1:01:19] saying anything I'm not saying one way
[1:01:21] or the other I'm saying that God saying
[1:01:23] come a little higher he told John a type
[1:01:26] of the Bride of Jesus Christ there's a
[1:01:28] door open in heaven he saw it and he
[1:01:30] said come a little
[1:01:32] higher what did that mean it didn't mean
[1:01:35] to get popped up it meant to get a
[1:01:38] little more Revelation Hallelujah get a
[1:01:40] little more Revelation about the word
[1:01:42] and what that word means to us and you
[1:01:45] know I just couldn't help but think you
[1:01:46] know is it in the preaching is it in the
[1:01:48] music is it in the conduct alls I could
[1:01:50] think about is it starts with me and
[1:01:53] sure enough many people would say you're
[1:01:54] right brother Barry it starts with you
[1:01:56] you're the pastor and I take that I say
[1:01:58] yes it does I'm the shepherd I'm
[1:02:00] supposed to sleep at the door I'm
[1:02:03] supposed to smell like the Sheep I'm
[1:02:05] supposed to know them by name I'm
[1:02:07] supposed to know what's going on with
[1:02:09] them but I can't help but think brothers
[1:02:11] and sisters it starts with me we need to
[1:02:12] look in the mirror and say it starts
[1:02:14] right here this is where that calling
[1:02:16] going higher starts is right here are we
[1:02:19] willing to put ourselves in that
[1:02:21] position or are we just fine and say hey
[1:02:23] you know what I made it I know that if
[1:02:26] elected if I'm predestinated by God
[1:02:28] before the foundation of the world and
[1:02:29] I'm just going to be there anyway so I
[1:02:31] could just eat drink and be marry
[1:02:33] because tomorrow I die I'll never be
[1:02:34] lost you know what the spirit of Christ
[1:02:37] constrains us to always strive for a
[1:02:40] little more am that's the believer's
[1:02:43] position in Christ brothers and sisters
[1:02:45] is to die out daily Paul the first age
[1:02:48] messenger he was the pattern for the
[1:02:50] church said I Die
[1:02:53] daily are we dying daily
[1:02:58] this is all just from a couple minutes
[1:03:00] in the back my Hallelujah I just can't
[1:03:04] help but think you know we just need to
[1:03:05] say Lord where am
[1:03:07] I genuinely sincerely Lord where am I is
[1:03:11] my experience gone cold is my experience
[1:03:13] gone distracted is my experience
[1:03:17] wrong search me and try me the seventh
[1:03:20] angel messenger said that in the
[1:03:21] invisible Union of the Bride when he
[1:03:23] prayed he said Lord search me and try me
[1:03:28] am so what's our desire amen how do we
[1:03:31] measure up with the word brothers and
[1:03:33] sisters I just want to I just want to
[1:03:35] try and encourage us this morning to
[1:03:37] think why let's take an inventory let's
[1:03:40] see where we're at if we keep do if we
[1:03:42] want
[1:03:43] more we have to do more and maybe not
[1:03:47] necessarily more labor more effort what
[1:03:51] we have to do is maybe just adjust what
[1:03:53] we do CU if we keep doing the same thing
[1:03:56] we're going to keep getting the same
[1:03:58] results if we want to see different
[1:04:00] results let's try new things
[1:04:04] am you know uh just a little bit of
[1:04:07] housekeeping I have to mention here
[1:04:09] about the
[1:04:11] church I just want to remind us that I'm
[1:04:14] going into a study of church doctrine
[1:04:16] Church order conduct order and Doctrine
[1:04:19] cood we'll be going into various aspects
[1:04:22] of it and uh I'm certainly excited about
[1:04:24] it because there's so much in there and
[1:04:26] it's not just about the natural and the
[1:04:28] building even though it is very much
[1:04:31] it's very much about the Tabernacle yes
[1:04:33] the building that we're in so I I just
[1:04:35] want to talk about perceived
[1:04:37] expectations versus communicated
[1:04:40] expectations and I think it's been a
[1:04:42] very long time since we've actually
[1:04:44] communicated the the expectations of
[1:04:47] what we want to see in this building and
[1:04:50] it's according to church doctrine
[1:04:52] conduct order and Doctrine what what the
[1:04:54] prophet said and you know I brought it
[1:04:56] up in the past and I'll I'll continually
[1:04:58] bring this up to stir up our Pure Minds
[1:05:00] by way of remembrance but you know the
[1:05:02] Tabernacle in the wilderness was a
[1:05:04] pretty sacred place the children of
[1:05:07] Israel recognized that's where God
[1:05:10] Elohim came down and met with the people
[1:05:13] met with Moses Moses was given the very
[1:05:15] specific instructions to build the
[1:05:17] Tabernacle to very specific details if
[1:05:20] you haven't read that recently it's a
[1:05:22] really interesting read there's no
[1:05:24] question about the way God wanted that
[1:05:26] Tabernacle built right to the finest
[1:05:29] details and we know that there was three
[1:05:31] courts there was the outer Court there
[1:05:33] was the inner court and then there was
[1:05:35] the holy of holies it's the holy place
[1:05:38] is what it's called in the Bible and we
[1:05:40] call it the the the holiest or the holy
[1:05:42] place there's many different
[1:05:44] descriptions of it but in that place
[1:05:47] behind that Veil is where the high
[1:05:49] priest met with the spirit of God met
[1:05:52] with the Lord Elohim and today we know
[1:05:56] that when Jesus died at Calvary what was
[1:05:59] the very first order of business for him
[1:06:01] before he went up before he went down
[1:06:03] the first order of business for him
[1:06:05] before he actually departed from the
[1:06:07] Earth was to go right to the Tabernacle
[1:06:10] as his custom was right and this time to
[1:06:12] preach a different gospel this time to
[1:06:14] set the example that that Veil that was
[1:06:17] blocking man from God is now torn from
[1:06:21] the bottom to the top fully there's no
[1:06:24] more Veil that's what he went to the
[1:06:26] temple to do to show man that now once
[1:06:29] upon a time it was death to go behind
[1:06:32] that Veil Uninvited but now to not go
[1:06:35] behind that Veil is death amen that's
[1:06:38] right amen so brothers and sisters when
[1:06:41] we come to this building here this is
[1:06:43] behind that Veil amen that's right we've
[1:06:46] heard about the pillar of fire and many
[1:06:49] people probably wonder I sure would like
[1:06:50] to see that Pillar of Fire I would say
[1:06:52] I'd sure like to see that Pillar of Fire
[1:06:54] you know in in certain Circ cumstances I
[1:06:56] think maybe I've seen a little bit of it
[1:06:58] I don't know maybe someone here could
[1:06:59] say I've seen it brother and have a
[1:07:01] whole testimony about it I'd love to
[1:07:02] hear it and I'm not mocking you at all
[1:07:05] I'm saying that Pillar of Fire is 100%
[1:07:07] real and some people have the ability to
[1:07:10] see it some people are blessed to be
[1:07:12] able to see it but you know that Pillar
[1:07:15] of Fire it's not something that's
[1:07:16] sitting in here waiting for us it's not
[1:07:18] on a picture on a wall and and and it's
[1:07:20] just here waiting for us that Pillar of
[1:07:22] Fire is the Holy Ghost Inside of us amen
[1:07:26] and when we come together and are in
[1:07:28] unity of spirit in one mind and one
[1:07:30] Accord in reverence to the word that
[1:07:34] that little tiny licks of fire come
[1:07:36] together and make one big Pillar of Fire
[1:07:38] and that's where brothers and sisters we
[1:07:40] can come in you know brother bradam said
[1:07:42] we should be able to ch ch challenge any
[1:07:44] Joe Lewis Spirit to walk through those
[1:07:46] doors any cancer Spirit to walk through
[1:07:49] those doors they won't be able to stand
[1:07:51] the presence of almighty God of that
[1:07:53] Pillar of Fire
[1:07:55] yes but it's all about our approach amen
[1:08:00] where do we stand with our approach do
[1:08:03] we come to church just looking for a a
[1:08:06] denominational experience or are we
[1:08:08] actually coming into the Temple of the
[1:08:10] most high God now it's an absolute
[1:08:13] Paradox because naturally speaking this
[1:08:15] building here is I would say not a very
[1:08:18] good building maybe it's a a golden
[1:08:19] oldie it used to be an old uh Community
[1:08:22] Center I think maybe at one point it was
[1:08:24] a church it was like built in 19 I think
[1:08:28] 12ish there's a whole lot of
[1:08:30] documentation in the uh Community Hall
[1:08:32] just north of here about this building
[1:08:34] very specifically it's had many
[1:08:36] Renovations it's had many different
[1:08:37] things go through it but this is where
[1:08:40] we we find it now today once upon a time
[1:08:43] we actually got this building we were
[1:08:46] able to get this building and when we
[1:08:48] got this building we as a body of
[1:08:50] Believers got this building it wasn't
[1:08:52] just our doing it was God giving it to
[1:08:54] us
[1:08:56] God gave us this building as a place of
[1:08:58] worship right and you know even though
[1:09:01] he gave it to us we still had to
[1:09:05] March yes yes we still had to have
[1:09:08] brothers and sisters offered to take
[1:09:11] pledges above and beyond what their
[1:09:13] tithes were above and beyond what their
[1:09:15] offerings were there had to be a few
[1:09:18] people come together and say we're
[1:09:19] willing to actually put our shoulder to
[1:09:21] the wheel financially to make this
[1:09:24] happen and and brother Ken Let It Go for
[1:09:26] a while until we got into the building
[1:09:28] and things settled down and then he
[1:09:29] actually canceled it he said no the
[1:09:31] church can pay for it it was a wonderful
[1:09:34] thing but what I'm getting at brothers
[1:09:35] and sisters Is Not only was there the
[1:09:37] financial commitment which was above and
[1:09:39] beyond there was also the physical
[1:09:41] commitment those people who are around
[1:09:43] at the time remember once upon a time in
[1:09:45] the basement we had water and and we had
[1:09:47] to actually physically work to fix that
[1:09:50] problem we renovated this whole entire
[1:09:53] Upper Floor it took a lot of work there
[1:09:56] was a contractor involved with it but
[1:09:58] there was still a lot of volunteer hours
[1:10:01] on the side all of the painting all of
[1:10:03] the lights there was so much that went
[1:10:04] into it what I'm getting at brothers and
[1:10:06] sisters is this building didn't just
[1:10:10] happen someone didn't just go like this
[1:10:12] and we had a building it wasn't just
[1:10:15] given it to us by a contractor from the
[1:10:17] mother's ship because we're Associated
[1:10:19] to another
[1:10:21] denomination we actually had to March
[1:10:24] forward to get this building
[1:10:26] am so where I'm going is we want to talk
[1:10:28] about the perceived expectations and
[1:10:32] communicated expectations I don't think
[1:10:34] there's been communicated expectations
[1:10:36] for a very long time so I just want to
[1:10:38] try and Center us a little bit more
[1:10:40] bring us back to the middle so we can
[1:10:42] actually make sure that we're all
[1:10:45] understanding what the expectations are
[1:10:47] when we come to the house of the Lord we
[1:10:49] talked about it a little while ago in
[1:10:51] terms of dress and I think that needs to
[1:10:53] be mentioned I'm not going to harp on
[1:10:54] that today but what I do want to harp on
[1:10:57] is a little bit about our conduct in the
[1:10:59] building
[1:11:02] here we ask that everyone would please
[1:11:06] take pride in what we have here amen and
[1:11:09] and I know for the most part everyone
[1:11:12] does yes but there's some situations
[1:11:15] that we've encountered where you can see
[1:11:17] that maybe the the the perceived
[1:11:20] expectation just doesn't line up with
[1:11:23] what should be communicated
[1:11:25] maybe it's it's the expectation that
[1:11:27] hasn't ever been said but sometimes you
[1:11:29] think maybe you don't have to say
[1:11:32] it I mean but here we are we find
[1:11:34] ourselves this way so let's just go
[1:11:36] forwards together as a body of Believers
[1:11:38] there's there's some in kindergarten and
[1:11:40] there's some with phds well on graduated
[1:11:43] who have authored books many people from
[1:11:46] many different various walks and
[1:11:48] backgrounds right but if anybody's
[1:11:50] wondering about it I'm just going to say
[1:11:52] it plainly like I did before this
[1:11:54] sanctuary the basement of the church is
[1:11:57] no place to be clipping your
[1:11:59] fingernails if you want to clip your
[1:12:00] fingernails go
[1:12:02] outside let your fingernails go outside
[1:12:06] that's right the sanctuary the Temple of
[1:12:09] the most high God is not the place to
[1:12:11] clip your fingernails now why are you
[1:12:13] saying that brother Barry CU somebody
[1:12:15] was someone found a nest of fingernails
[1:12:17] in the in the
[1:12:19] sanctuary I'm just going to be plain
[1:12:22] don't do
[1:12:23] it it's not polite
[1:12:26] if that's if that's what brothers and
[1:12:27] sisters think what does God think right
[1:12:32] Y what I want to say today is
[1:12:35] specifically remember the sanctuary is
[1:12:39] Holy we want to keep this space holy we
[1:12:43] want to give this space to be a hallowed
[1:12:46] space we know that we bring the Holy
[1:12:48] Ghost he doesn't live here but you know
[1:12:50] we had a prophet I would say this we had
[1:12:53] the holy ghost in the prophet say that
[1:12:55] even a child running in the
[1:12:59] sanctuary can upset the Holy Ghost for
[1:13:03] future
[1:13:05] services so if a child running if you
[1:13:08] think about this un God said unless you
[1:13:11] come to me as a little child you'll in
[1:13:13] no wise enter the
[1:13:15] Kingdom so so think about how the word
[1:13:17] is the child has Earnest Behavior the
[1:13:20] child is not looking to just go and and
[1:13:22] run around and and like we heard about
[1:13:25] One Church they would do with the youth
[1:13:26] is play dodgeball in the sanctuary the
[1:13:29] child isn't actually going to do that
[1:13:31] the child is in Earnest just maybe
[1:13:33] running out of the
[1:13:34] sanctuary we had the prophet say even
[1:13:37] that can upset the Holy Ghost let's
[1:13:41] consider ourselves when we gather
[1:13:43] together in the sanctuary brothers and
[1:13:44] sisters when we gather together in this
[1:13:46] building the basement is an extension of
[1:13:51] this the basement downstairs is an
[1:13:54] extension of the
[1:13:56] sanctuary if anybody has any questions
[1:13:58] about that please come and talk about it
[1:14:00] it's important for us to remember this
[1:14:02] the basement is an extension of this
[1:14:05] Sanctuary that's why we have TVs there
[1:14:07] that's why we have the sound there so we
[1:14:09] can take our children maybe if they're a
[1:14:11] little squirmy here maybe if they need a
[1:14:13] drink maybe if they have to go to the
[1:14:14] bathroom whatever they just can't sit
[1:14:16] still we want to take them downstairs
[1:14:18] and take them out of the service so
[1:14:19] they're not distracting those around us
[1:14:21] for the record I don't get distracted
[1:14:23] very easy I can preach through a
[1:14:25] screaming child Kicking and Screaming
[1:14:27] being taken out the door that's fine
[1:14:29] that's not an issue for me but where it
[1:14:30] becomes an issue is for the parents and
[1:14:33] people sitting around where there's a
[1:14:35] child that's right that's got a crinkly
[1:14:38] bag or they've got something they're
[1:14:40] doing and it's making some sort of
[1:14:42] little noise that can drive people crazy
[1:14:45] to the point where they can't actually
[1:14:47] focus on the word right as parents it's
[1:14:51] our responsibility to make sure that
[1:14:53] we're being vigilant about that that and
[1:14:55] if you want a comparison think about how
[1:14:57] we would be if we went and got and sat
[1:14:59] down in the presence of prime minister
[1:15:03] trudo in his
[1:15:05] cabinet would we behave the same way
[1:15:08] with our children in front of him that
[1:15:10] sometimes we do in the Church of the
[1:15:12] Living
[1:15:13] God would our children be allowed to
[1:15:15] make noises would they be allowed to
[1:15:18] squirm around I think not I think we
[1:15:21] would probably get a little bit
[1:15:22] embarrassed and think I better get this
[1:15:24] kid out of here because they're just
[1:15:25] distracting people and if we don't think
[1:15:28] that way I just want to encourage us try
[1:15:29] and think that way because you're not
[1:15:32] distracted the preaching you're
[1:15:33] distracting your brothers and sisters
[1:15:35] that's all yes the basement is an
[1:15:38] extension of the sanctuary please
[1:15:40] remember that if we're going to have a
[1:15:42] snack at all it's not in the
[1:15:46] sanctuary not in the sanctuary take the
[1:15:48] children out if you want to have a snack
[1:15:51] we're finding crumbs we're finding stuff
[1:15:54] this is not not the place for snacks
[1:15:56] it's not the place for drinks if you
[1:15:57] need a drink you're welcome to just go
[1:15:59] out if you want to bring a water bottle
[1:16:01] in that's I'm going to say this that's
[1:16:03] fine I'm not going to dispute it because
[1:16:05] some people are probably saying well
[1:16:06] what about you brother
[1:16:09] Barry hey what's good for the goose is
[1:16:11] good for the gander yeah if you want to
[1:16:13] bring a bottle of water in that's okay
[1:16:15] as parents it's your responsibility to
[1:16:18] manage your children that's right if the
[1:16:20] children want to start dumping their
[1:16:21] water bottle out if they want to put it
[1:16:23] in the pocket in the front of the seat
[1:16:24] upside down down and it starts to drip
[1:16:25] water out that's not the child's
[1:16:28] fault we need to make sure that we're
[1:16:31] watching over our kids if we're going to
[1:16:33] have a snack it's
[1:16:34] downstairs but you know when we do that
[1:16:37] the parents need to be managing their
[1:16:39] children not having children run around
[1:16:41] I'm not interested in trying to tell us
[1:16:43] how to parent what I am saying is
[1:16:45] reverence the house of God please amen
[1:16:47] please amen we found crumbs all over the
[1:16:50] place Bits of food come on would we
[1:16:54] beave that way in our living rooms I
[1:16:57] don't know maybe we would some people
[1:17:00] might but that's not how we do it here
[1:17:03] and that's why I'm saying it in case we
[1:17:06] want to have the benefit of the doubt
[1:17:07] for everyone we want to make sure
[1:17:09] everyone feels comfortable but please
[1:17:11] brothers and sisters don't just throw it
[1:17:12] all on the cleaners and say it's their
[1:17:14] problem whatever my kid made a mess and
[1:17:16] other kids are stepping in it
[1:17:18] and let's have
[1:17:21] respect if if if children need to have a
[1:17:24] snack please just take them downstairs
[1:17:25] set them
[1:17:26] down make them have a snack sitting down
[1:17:29] and then if there's a mess whose
[1:17:32] responsibility is that to clean is it
[1:17:33] the kids is it the cleaners no it's the
[1:17:38] parents that's why I say it behooves us
[1:17:41] as parents to make sure that when
[1:17:42] they're snacking they're snacking clean
[1:17:45] I don't know just simple things brothers
[1:17:47] and sisters but what can happen is this
[1:17:49] can cause problems and people can become
[1:17:51] upset and frustrated and maybe start to
[1:17:53] think thoughts and the devil just loves
[1:17:55] to get in any detail that he can right
[1:17:58] that's why I don't want to just leave
[1:17:59] this as maybe just a a an expectation
[1:18:04] that well somewhere along the way
[1:18:05] someone has said it right we're going to
[1:18:08] say it clearly yes this is the house of
[1:18:11] the Living God let's reverence it we're
[1:18:14] being called a little higher clearly as
[1:18:15] we heard in the song service and I say
[1:18:17] Amen call me higher Lord let let me let
[1:18:20] me just encourage one another so that we
[1:18:23] can actually see the spirit of God go
[1:18:24] move in our midst that he's happy with
[1:18:26] our our lives and and what we
[1:18:29] do so just to be clear downstairs is an
[1:18:33] extension of the sanctuary downstairs
[1:18:36] was always intended this is why we
[1:18:38] bought the screens this is why we put
[1:18:40] the sound in way back with brother Ken
[1:18:42] by the way not just brother Barry here
[1:18:44] this was with brother Ken and and that
[1:18:46] Sanctuary goes downstairs the sanctuary
[1:18:50] is actually in the basement where those
[1:18:51] chairs are some people can't sit here
[1:18:54] because of their children for whatever
[1:18:56] various reasons we're not judging we
[1:18:58] provided that place so they could go
[1:18:59] there and still participate but when we
[1:19:01] have other things going on it becomes
[1:19:04] very difficult to engage in the service
[1:19:06] people can't hear what's being preached
[1:19:10] maybe they can can't see it because it's
[1:19:12] being blocked we need to make sure that
[1:19:14] we have the same reverence level down
[1:19:16] there brothers and sisters people want
[1:19:18] to be fed and you know I'll tell you for
[1:19:20] those people that don't know who haven't
[1:19:23] experienced it yet there's some people
[1:19:25] that have never been married but those
[1:19:26] married people especially those that are
[1:19:28] that are with children you understand
[1:19:30] exactly what I'm saying especially to
[1:19:32] sisters it's impossible to come to
[1:19:34] church with a squirmy kid and get fed
[1:19:37] for many years and you know a lot of
[1:19:40] times the brothers will just be like
[1:19:41] yeah it's her problem that's her calling
[1:19:42] in life she'll be saved in
[1:19:44] childbearing I'm going to sit in the
[1:19:46] church and I'm going to say Amen to the
[1:19:48] word and she's going to struggle with
[1:19:49] three kids all on her
[1:19:52] own how can she ever get fed if she's
[1:19:56] not given an opportunity brothers and
[1:19:57] sisters we need to make sure that we're
[1:19:59] doing that by giving space in the
[1:20:01] basement not allowing kids to run around
[1:20:03] by reverencing this house and
[1:20:05] recognizing that we have to train our
[1:20:07] children to sit down and listen this is
[1:20:10] church if they want to run around
[1:20:12] there's a park take them out let them
[1:20:14] run around clearly they they don't have
[1:20:17] the ability to hear the word of God so
[1:20:19] sometimes that's the way it is the
[1:20:21] prophet even said we'll get into it in
[1:20:23] the conduct order and Doctrine that if
[1:20:25] you can't have a child set still if you
[1:20:27] can't have a child behave in church then
[1:20:29] you oughtn't to bring them to church
[1:20:31] that's what the prophet said that's
[1:20:33] right so downstairs brothers and sisters
[1:20:35] is set up to be an extension of the
[1:20:37] sanctuary not a place to sit and
[1:20:39] socialize while the preaching is
[1:20:41] happening or while the singing is going
[1:20:42] on it's not a social club it's the place
[1:20:46] to be in service just like this
[1:20:49] Sanctuary so please make the Deacon's
[1:20:52] job easy they're going to be actually
[1:20:54] encouraging us about what I'm speaking
[1:20:57] about right
[1:20:58] now this needs to be said we need to
[1:21:01] know that this is not just a perceived
[1:21:05] expectation and we're hoping that
[1:21:06] everyone's getting it I hope it's loud
[1:21:08] and clear and I hope it's not too much
[1:21:10] but remember this is the house of the
[1:21:12] Living God the basement's an extension
[1:21:14] of the sanctuary if your kids are going
[1:21:15] to have snacks parent them if if if they
[1:21:19] can't be quiet you know we have the two
[1:21:22] separate rooms and we have agreed that
[1:21:23] this would work well you can take them
[1:21:25] into one or the other room the Sunday
[1:21:27] School room and please mind the Sunday
[1:21:29] School equipment for sister Shelly she
[1:21:31] would very much appreciate that if you
[1:21:32] have your kids in there I know they want
[1:21:34] to have their own Sunday school but it's
[1:21:37] for when sister Shell is there but you
[1:21:39] know those rooms they have solid
[1:21:41] corridors on them for those people that
[1:21:42] don't know what that means they're solid
[1:21:44] wood so they retain sound so you could
[1:21:46] actually go in there and actually close
[1:21:49] out sound if your child is screaming
[1:21:52] having a child screaming and hoping
[1:21:54] they're going to stop screaming while
[1:21:55] everyone is trying to listen to the word
[1:21:57] it's an impossible thing so just take
[1:21:59] that child maybe and go in one of those
[1:22:01] rooms and then everyone can continue to
[1:22:03] get fed I'm going to stop this is the
[1:22:05] house of God let's let's be called a
[1:22:08] little bit higher I think that the Lord
[1:22:09] wants to see us come a little higher and
[1:22:11] I if he's calling us where there's a
[1:22:13] deep calling there's got to be a deep to
[1:22:15] respond
[1:22:20] amen and don't worry about water in the
[1:22:22] sanctuary
[1:22:26] out the exposition of the seven Church
[1:22:29] ages actually I'm just going to go back
[1:22:31] to the scripture here um verse 33
[1:22:36] of verse 32 of St John chapter
[1:22:42] 8 and ye shall know the truth and the
[1:22:46] truth shall make you
[1:22:48] free if I had a title for today that's
[1:22:51] what it would be and the truth shall
[1:22:53] make you free
[1:22:55] how many people are free here
[1:22:57] today we have that glorious Liberty of
[1:23:00] knowing the
[1:23:02] truth what an incredible blessing it is
[1:23:05] to know the truth for our
[1:23:07] day out of the exposition of the seven
[1:23:09] Church ages Philadelphia and church age
[1:23:11] brother bradam he says oh I'm so glad
[1:23:13] that my Holiness is not of
[1:23:17] myself because our righteousness is but
[1:23:21] filthy rags before him isn't it that's
[1:23:24] the word of God I'm glad that I am in
[1:23:27] Christ with all his wonderful attributes
[1:23:31] of righteousness imputed yay imparted
[1:23:36] unto me blessed be God forever amen he
[1:23:40] has given those attributes to us we
[1:23:44] can't get them on our own but he's given
[1:23:47] them to us how does he give them to us
[1:23:49] get the Holy Ghost it's that simple when
[1:23:53] we get his spirit his mind comes into us
[1:23:56] and we start to live as a new creature
[1:23:58] we become a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:24:01] he goes on to say here out of the
[1:24:03] Philadelphia and church age these things
[1:24:05] saith he that is
[1:24:07] true now this word true is a very
[1:24:10] wonderful word I I'm stuck on this you
[1:24:13] might be saying we've heard this already
[1:24:14] but I'm stuck on it brothers and sisters
[1:24:16] it it does not mean true in just a sense
[1:24:20] that it is opposite to false it
[1:24:23] expresses the perfect realization of an
[1:24:26] idea as contrasted with its partial
[1:24:31] realization now I just want to go back
[1:24:33] to the scripture here brother Bram he
[1:24:35] talks about it as Revelation as you go a
[1:24:38] little further in this quote but let's
[1:24:39] go back to our scripture today out of
[1:24:41] John chapter 8 we know that Jesus we'll
[1:24:45] just start with verse 31 as we read this
[1:24:47] through here he says then said Jesus to
[1:24:50] those Jews which believe on him if you
[1:24:52] continue in my word then are ye my
[1:24:55] disciples indeed and ye shall know the
[1:24:58] truth and the truth shall make you
[1:25:02] free speaking to the Jews here the
[1:25:11] one excuse me try not to cough in your
[1:25:14] ear is bad
[1:25:17] enough he speaking to the Jews here
[1:25:19] these were the church
[1:25:20] members these were the leoty for the day
[1:25:24] yes
[1:25:25] and here's their response when the word
[1:25:27] was made flesh and was dwelling among
[1:25:29] them and he was letting them know that
[1:25:31] if you know the truth me being the truth
[1:25:34] the word of God which stands before you
[1:25:36] then you'll be free amen but here their
[1:25:40] response then they answered him we be
[1:25:43] Abraham's seed and were never in bondage
[1:25:47] to any man how sayest though ye shall be
[1:25:51] made
[1:25:52] free they did not have a perfect
[1:25:57] realization right they had an
[1:26:00] understanding we could go and get an
[1:26:02] ancest
[1:26:05] an yeah ancestory search done and be
[1:26:10] able to look back and see where we came
[1:26:12] from who our roots are they didn't need
[1:26:15] that they knew exactly who they were and
[1:26:17] truly they were The Offspring of Abraham
[1:26:22] but the interesting thing is they never
[1:26:24] had faith in their heart to mix with the
[1:26:26] word when it was made flesh and stood in
[1:26:29] front of them and interestingly today
[1:26:32] it's the same thing with the Gentile
[1:26:34] Church those people that don't have
[1:26:37] faith in their heart to mix with the
[1:26:39] word when it comes across their path or
[1:26:42] faith as a seed maybe we could word it
[1:26:44] that way when the word made
[1:26:47] flesh comes across our path and we hear
[1:26:50] about it we might not have the ability
[1:26:53] to actually see that word come to life
[1:26:56] if we don't have that seed if we don't
[1:26:57] have that
[1:26:59] Faith but I think it's interesting here
[1:27:01] these were the church members they
[1:27:02] answered him we be Abraham's seed and we
[1:27:05] never in bondage to any any man we were
[1:27:07] never under a a false leadership we were
[1:27:11] never under an erroneous message of a
[1:27:14] message church but there was never
[1:27:17] anything wrong in our lives from our
[1:27:19] youth we were raised in the
[1:27:21] truth and we know there was one Jesus
[1:27:24] came along and met that word made flesh
[1:27:26] met him and said hey you know what
[1:27:29] you've done all that from your youth but
[1:27:31] take all you've got and give it to the
[1:27:33] poor and pick up your cross and follow
[1:27:35] me and remember he was sorrowful because
[1:27:38] he was really really
[1:27:40] rich he likely had his daddy's business
[1:27:43] brother Brenham talks about an
[1:27:45] investment that boy when the word
[1:27:48] crossed his path he was not willing to
[1:27:50] let go of all this former teaching
[1:27:55] all he wanted to do was hold on to
[1:27:57] that and that held him back here we have
[1:28:01] this I I just want to say today don't
[1:28:03] believe brothers and sisters because
[1:28:05] maybe we've been raised in the message
[1:28:07] means that we've got it all figured out
[1:28:10] God is calling us higher and I think
[1:28:12] it's beautiful that we would have that
[1:28:13] little bump at the beginning of the
[1:28:15] service because I believe that's what
[1:28:17] God is doing don't think for a second
[1:28:20] because we know the message of the hour
[1:28:22] we where where're brother Bram SE seed
[1:28:24] we're Christ's seed and we are able to
[1:28:26] come to birth under his message that
[1:28:28] that's it that's where we stop that's
[1:28:30] not where we stop that's where we
[1:28:34] start that's the start of our journey we
[1:28:36] just see that that door in heaven is
[1:28:38] open and it's up to us to go a little
[1:28:42] higher Hallelujah are we willing to is
[1:28:45] the
[1:28:47] question what are we willing to
[1:28:49] sacrifice are we willing to sacrifice
[1:28:52] all that we got all that we are
[1:28:54] all that we
[1:28:56] think sometimes we don't have to
[1:28:58] sacrifice anything we just have to say
[1:29:01] amen I believe amen amen but sometimes
[1:29:06] there's things in our lives that will
[1:29:07] hold us back and unless we're willing to
[1:29:09] let it go we're not going to go any
[1:29:12] higher and make no mistake about it God
[1:29:14] will not leave us in the dark he won't
[1:29:16] leave us hanging and US wandering I
[1:29:18] wonder if there's anything in my life
[1:29:19] that I should actually lay down that
[1:29:21] Christ doesn't like is there something
[1:29:22] in my life that's displeasing to the
[1:29:25] Lord ask him that sometime genuinely
[1:29:28] sincerely from your heart if you have
[1:29:30] never if you have you know exactly what
[1:29:33] I'm saying
[1:29:35] amen he'll show you goes on to say here
[1:29:38] it expresses the perfect realization of
[1:29:40] an
[1:29:41] idea as contrasted with partial
[1:29:46] realization perfect realization and
[1:29:48] partial realization you can just leave
[1:29:50] it up there brother you don't have to
[1:29:51] take it down right away the part partial
[1:29:54] realization is we're Abraham's seed we
[1:29:57] know our lineage we're good we're we're
[1:30:01] rich we're we're increased with Goods we
[1:30:03] have need of nothing brother Barry what
[1:30:06] are you talking about I don't even
[1:30:08] understand what you're trying to
[1:30:10] say he's calling us higher there is a
[1:30:13] perfect
[1:30:15] realization of Truth and that is what
[1:30:18] will set us free I want to say this
[1:30:20] brothers and sisters if you're not free
[1:30:21] then you don't have the perfect
[1:30:22] realization
[1:30:24] that kind of Sears but I think you know
[1:30:26] what we all need it I need it I need it
[1:30:29] in my life I want to have that perfect
[1:30:31] realization in my life brother brother
[1:30:33] Ram goes on to say for example we recall
[1:30:36] that Jesus said in John 6:32 Moses gave
[1:30:38] you not that bread from heaven but my
[1:30:40] father giveth you the true bread from
[1:30:43] Heaven John 151 I am the True Vine
[1:30:46] Hebrews 9:24 for Christ is not entered
[1:30:49] into the holy places made with hands
[1:30:52] which are the figures of the truth
[1:30:54] but into heaven itself now to appear in
[1:30:58] the presence of God for US 1 John 2:8
[1:31:01] because the darkness is passed and the
[1:31:04] True Light now
[1:31:07] shineth since this word indeed expresses
[1:31:10] perfect realization as against the idea
[1:31:13] of a partial realization as Illustrated
[1:31:16] in these verses we can Now understand as
[1:31:19] never before antitype contrasted with
[1:31:23] type and substance with Shadow take ex
[1:31:26] the example now of Mana from Heaven God
[1:31:28] sent down Angel bread from heaven for
[1:31:30] Israel but that bread did not satisfy it
[1:31:32] was only good for a day those who ate it
[1:31:35] were hungry again the next day if it was
[1:31:37] left around it became
[1:31:39] contaminated but Jesus is the true bread
[1:31:43] from Heaven whereof Mana was just a
[1:31:47] type and they had Jesus standing right
[1:31:50] before
[1:31:51] them those Jews had the word made flesh
[1:31:56] and it's so beautiful because he speaks
[1:31:58] in Parables doesn't he yes he does if
[1:32:01] any man eats of that bread that came
[1:32:04] from Heaven he will never hunger again
[1:32:06] he does not need to come back and eat
[1:32:08] again the moment that he partook he had
[1:32:10] eternal life here indeed was reality no
[1:32:12] longer a need for a shadow no need for a
[1:32:15] partial salvation here is the whole of
[1:32:16] it just like Jesus isn't a part of God
[1:32:19] he is
[1:32:21] God understanding that name of Jesus
[1:32:24] brothers and sisters is something we can
[1:32:26] never take for granted when we speak the
[1:32:29] name of Jesus under the revelation of
[1:32:32] the seventh Angel's messenger under the
[1:32:34] opening of the seventh seal when we
[1:32:36] speak the name of
[1:32:38] Jesus all Heavens in Earth will pass
[1:32:41] away but that name never will my and we
[1:32:46] know that there's only one name whereby
[1:32:48] we can be saved Hallelujah we know
[1:32:50] there's only one name that's going to
[1:32:52] cast out a devil we know there's only
[1:32:55] one name that brings salvation and
[1:32:58] deliverance to our
[1:33:00] lives I just think it's so beautiful
[1:33:02] when we look at this scripture here how
[1:33:04] indeed we could say very easily you know
[1:33:07] what I I I'm I'm Abraham's seed man i'
[1:33:10] I've been in the message I was never in
[1:33:11] bondage under any uncertain sound under
[1:33:14] any wrong Ministry I I had the pure word
[1:33:18] my whole entire
[1:33:19] life but do we have the Holy Ghost is
[1:33:22] the question brothers and sisters
[1:33:24] because this message isn't about
[1:33:26] understanding the message this message
[1:33:29] is about going on and getting into
[1:33:31] Christ getting the true baptism of the
[1:33:34] Holy
[1:33:35] Ghost John chapter 8 then said Jesus to
[1:33:38] those Jews which believed on him if you
[1:33:40] continue in my word then you are my
[1:33:43] disciples and isn't that wonderful if
[1:33:45] you continue in my word and not if you
[1:33:47] continue in my ways if you continue in
[1:33:49] whatever I think should happen my
[1:33:52] actions if you continue in my church if
[1:33:56] you continue in my word then you shall
[1:33:59] be my disciples and ye shall know the
[1:34:01] truth how will we ever know the truth
[1:34:03] brothers and sisters unless the spirit
[1:34:06] of truth comes into our
[1:34:10] lives how does the spirit of Truth come
[1:34:12] into our lives just because we receive
[1:34:15] the message just because we're born into
[1:34:16] a message Church a message home no
[1:34:20] because we get the baptism of the Holy
[1:34:21] Ghost Hallelujah that's the spirit of
[1:34:23] Truth truth amen when the spirit he the
[1:34:26] spirit of truth comes into our life we
[1:34:28] become a new creature we get a new mind
[1:34:31] inside of us and it controls our bodies
[1:34:34] Hallelujah the things that we once
[1:34:36] desired we no longer
[1:34:39] desire I think this 832 out of St John
[1:34:44] in the Amplified Bible I'll say it out
[1:34:46] of the King James and ye shall know the
[1:34:48] truth and the truth shall make you free
[1:34:50] in the Amplified Bible it says it the
[1:34:52] way that I had always thought it and I
[1:34:55] know that I studied the King James Bible
[1:34:56] I've read the King James Bible but many
[1:34:58] times we say it this way that the truth
[1:35:00] shall not make us free that it shall set
[1:35:03] us free it's an interesting
[1:35:06] comparison and you will know the truth
[1:35:08] and the truth will set you free it's not
[1:35:11] going to set us free brothers and
[1:35:13] sisters we're not in
[1:35:15] bondage Sons and Daughters of God are
[1:35:17] not in bondage they always were Sons and
[1:35:19] Daughters of God Amen we don't need to
[1:35:22] be set free we need to be made free amen
[1:35:26] it's no accident that the word is
[1:35:28] written that way either you know talking
[1:35:32] about Revelation the exposition of the
[1:35:33] seven Church ages the importance of
[1:35:36] Revelation to a True Believer I just
[1:35:40] can't get enough of this either brothers
[1:35:41] and sisters it's very important for us
[1:35:43] to remember it you know we could be in
[1:35:45] the message of the hour for 50 years for
[1:35:47] 60 years for 75 years and make no
[1:35:50] mistake about it there's still further
[1:35:52] revelation
[1:35:54] because we're talking about God that's
[1:35:56] right he's going to reveal himself to us
[1:35:59] throughout the Millennium throughout
[1:36:01] eternity he's going to reveal himself
[1:36:04] continually to us in these mere mortal
[1:36:07] Minds 70 years 80 years maybe of serving
[1:36:10] God under the guise of the message of
[1:36:12] the hour some people could say I I don't
[1:36:15] need any more Revelation I've got
[1:36:17] salvation sure but that's exactly where
[1:36:20] you'll stop there's more
[1:36:24] and it's not more message it's more
[1:36:26] Christ brothers and sisters hallelujah
[1:36:28] it's more Christ amen the importance of
[1:36:31] Revelation by the spirit to a True
[1:36:35] Believer it's not just Revelation it's
[1:36:37] Revelation by the
[1:36:40] spirit it can never be
[1:36:43] overemphasized Revelation means more to
[1:36:45] you than perhaps you realize now I'm not
[1:36:47] talking about this book of Revelation
[1:36:49] and you I'm talking about all revelation
[1:36:54] it's tremendously important to the
[1:36:55] church do you remember in Matthew 16
[1:36:58] where Jesus asked the disciples this
[1:36:59] question who do men say I excuse me the
[1:37:02] son of man am I'm sorry if I sound like
[1:37:06] a stuck record preaching something that
[1:37:08] maybe I I've preached before but I I
[1:37:11] just I can't get past it if the Lord
[1:37:13] leads me back to it I I I just have to
[1:37:16] go forwards and and preach what he says
[1:37:18] to do and I I just hope that whatever
[1:37:21] the Lord is trying to accomplish by this
[1:37:23] this becomes accomplished I think he's
[1:37:25] calling someone if not everyone a little
[1:37:28] higher and like I say that with this he
[1:37:31] says in there that it can never be
[1:37:32] overemphasized so we can say it a lot I
[1:37:35] hope that's okay but you know brothers
[1:37:36] and sisters where I want to get down to
[1:37:38] is the nitty-gritty you know when in
[1:37:39] verse 33 of John chapter 8 they answered
[1:37:42] him we be of Abraham's seed and were
[1:37:44] never in bondage to any man how sayest
[1:37:46] though ye shall be made free who are you
[1:37:48] to tell us that this could actually
[1:37:50] happen we already know who we are we
[1:37:53] know our lineage we know that we're
[1:37:55] saved according to the Old Testament
[1:37:57] law you know what we have we have a case
[1:38:00] of
[1:38:01] knowledge slash
[1:38:03] information we can have a lot of head
[1:38:05] knowledge and a lot of information we
[1:38:08] can even have a lot of experience in
[1:38:09] terms of tenure but we read that
[1:38:11] scripture a little while ago tenure
[1:38:12] doesn't mean anything sometimes tenure
[1:38:15] can actually be a little bit of a
[1:38:17] disruption in terms of our walk with the
[1:38:19] Lord yes it can because that tenure can
[1:38:22] make us believe that we're actually in a
[1:38:24] position that we're actually
[1:38:27] not knowledge SL information is one
[1:38:31] thing that is what will lead to
[1:38:33] Revelation if we're willing to follow
[1:38:36] the information and the knowledge that
[1:38:37] we're
[1:38:40] given but it takes
[1:38:42] Revelation by the spirit not just
[1:38:46] revelation we can have revelation we can
[1:38:48] have a surprise and say wow I never
[1:38:50] realized that and and and experience
[1:38:53] Revelation but Revelation by the spirit
[1:38:55] brothers and sisters is the next level
[1:38:58] Revelation by the spirit is what will
[1:39:00] cause us to become a new creature in
[1:39:02] Christ Jesus amen is it very warm in
[1:39:05] here this
[1:39:06] morning it feels warm it feels
[1:39:10] warm I wondered maybe we should open a
[1:39:13] window or something it's Revelation by
[1:39:16] the spirit brothers and sisters that's
[1:39:18] going to actually change our
[1:39:21] bodies it's not understanding
[1:39:24] that's going to do it it's not
[1:39:25] information that's going to do it but
[1:39:28] it's through the spoken word that we
[1:39:30] gain information hallelujah it's through
[1:39:34] the spoken word that we can gain
[1:39:37] knowledge from that understanding it has
[1:39:39] to become though more than knowledge to
[1:39:42] us in order for it to become Revelation
[1:39:45] Revelation to the individual is more
[1:39:48] than just learning knowledge and
[1:39:51] understanding Revelation to the
[1:39:52] individual ual is what brother bradam
[1:39:54] said is the new birth Christ revealing
[1:39:59] himself personally to the
[1:40:03] individual
[1:40:05] amen but you know what I want to get to
[1:40:07] is what what's our attitude do we line
[1:40:09] up with what verse 33
[1:40:12] says or do we actually have a different
[1:40:16] attitude towards the word in our day are
[1:40:19] we willing to say teach me Lord lead me
[1:40:21] take me higher I want to go further you
[1:40:24] know knowing the word is one thing but
[1:40:29] actually living it is a totally separate
[1:40:32] thing Revelation to the individual I
[1:40:35] I'll say it this way it becomes an
[1:40:37] intimate understanding of it it it takes
[1:40:41] it to the next level where brother
[1:40:42] brandham talks about being able to read
[1:40:45] between the lines when his wife writes
[1:40:48] him a letter he can see what she's
[1:40:51] trying to say to him he can read the
[1:40:53] words that's one thing but he can also
[1:40:56] understand what the point is she's
[1:40:57] trying to get across to him and
[1:41:00] sometimes I wonder if we're able to get
[1:41:02] the point of what the word is trying to
[1:41:04] get across to us are we actually
[1:41:07] catching the drift about what the
[1:41:09] message of the hour is calling us to do
[1:41:11] today amen we're being called to get
[1:41:14] ready for a Rapture he's calling a
[1:41:17] church out of a church this is not a
[1:41:19] time to get complacent or a time to get
[1:41:21] tired for those people that hike or run
[1:41:24] or do anything endurance wise you know
[1:41:27] what that means you can get halfway up
[1:41:29] the mountain and think you've come so
[1:41:31] far but you're going to the top man
[1:41:33] you're not going
[1:41:35] halfway you still have more to go
[1:41:38] sometimes we just need to take a little
[1:41:39] rest just relax a little bit allow the
[1:41:43] the the oxygen to catch up in our bodies
[1:41:46] maybe let the blood flow maybe have a
[1:41:48] little snack that's why we come to the
[1:41:50] house of the Lord we're we're actually
[1:41:52] in an endurance run it's not just a
[1:41:56] Sprint we're going all the way brothers
[1:41:58] and sisters to the top of the
[1:42:01] mountain it's got to be more than
[1:42:03] knowledge it has to be a revelation to
[1:42:05] us it has to become an intimate
[1:42:08] understanding being able to read between
[1:42:10] the lines where we no longer just see it
[1:42:12] as text but we see it as a love letter
[1:42:15] about us where we can put our names
[1:42:18] there and say he's talking about me
[1:42:26] today we're supposed to go to our
[1:42:27] brother and our
[1:42:29] sister I got into this a little bit in
[1:42:32] Edmonton I think it's so good just a a
[1:42:34] for free this is a for free
[1:42:38] today supposed to go to our brother and
[1:42:40] sister if there's an issue not give
[1:42:42] place to the devil right the word says
[1:42:45] go to him not send him a text doesn't
[1:42:47] say send him an email doesn't say phone
[1:42:49] him says go to
[1:42:52] him takes a lot of courage to do that
[1:42:54] when there's a bee in our Bonnet but you
[1:42:56] know when we have the right spirit in
[1:42:58] our
[1:42:59] lives he the spirit of truth will give
[1:43:01] us the courage to do it in
[1:43:03] love
[1:43:06] right information and
[1:43:09] knowledge has to become a revelation to
[1:43:12] the individual and when it becomes a
[1:43:14] revelation to the individual what
[1:43:16] happens is it becomes a new creature in
[1:43:19] Christ Jesus amen when it's Revelation
[1:43:22] by the Spirit about the
[1:43:27] word I just think it's so beautiful when
[1:43:29] we can look at this brothers and sisters
[1:43:31] you know we we're not here to have a
[1:43:33] code of conduct we're not here to to to
[1:43:36] mess around we're here to get people to
[1:43:38] Jesus Christ who is the same yesterday
[1:43:40] today and forever and like we said at
[1:43:42] the beginning of the service you know
[1:43:43] he's not coming it's not like he was
[1:43:46] here he's
[1:43:47] hereall how many people are gathered in
[1:43:50] the name of Jesus Christ right now show
[1:43:52] of hands
[1:43:55] he's here hallah his word says where two
[1:43:58] or three are gathered in my name I'm
[1:44:01] there so what's our need brothers and
[1:44:03] sisters what do we have as a desire in
[1:44:05] our hearts do we think that he is not
[1:44:08] the same yesterday today and forever or
[1:44:10] that he is the same yesterday today and
[1:44:12] forever because he is more than able to
[1:44:14] deliver us or or help us or or bring us
[1:44:17] or get us whatever it is we need amen
[1:44:20] even right now Hallelujah
[1:44:27] I just think it's so beautiful when we
[1:44:28] get that that that intimate that
[1:44:31] knowledge moves from the intimacy it
[1:44:35] moves from the understanding the the
[1:44:37] head knowledge goes down it travels down
[1:44:40] and goes right down into our heart it
[1:44:42] becomes more than just a a head
[1:44:45] knowledge and an understanding about
[1:44:47] this word about the message of the hour
[1:44:49] about even Jesus Christ the same
[1:44:51] yesterday today forever but what it does
[1:44:53] is it shows that truly no matter what my
[1:44:56] faults and failures are I can be the
[1:44:58] Bride of Jesus Christ not because I
[1:44:59] chose it because his word chose it and
[1:45:02] what's weird is every time I read about
[1:45:04] the bride something jumps inside of me
[1:45:06] amen amen something happens when I hear
[1:45:09] that word
[1:45:11] bride I was thinking about it
[1:45:14] yesterday you just as a Believer you
[1:45:16] just can't look at a wedding ceremony
[1:45:19] the same once you get
[1:45:21] saved you just can't when you see a
[1:45:24] bride and a groom even worldly people
[1:45:26] when they're willing to go and get
[1:45:28] married at an altar there's something
[1:45:31] special about that and that's because it
[1:45:33] was first instituted before the
[1:45:35] foundation of the world not even in the
[1:45:36] Garden of Eden brothers and sisters he
[1:45:38] took a lamb of a bride of his own
[1:45:40] choosing before the foundation of the
[1:45:41] world that's what the word says but you
[1:45:44] know when we truly get to that place
[1:45:45] where we become the Bride of Jesus
[1:45:47] Christ where it goes from a a partial
[1:45:50] understanding or realization to the
[1:45:52] perfect realiz when I hear that and when
[1:45:54] I see that something happens inside of
[1:45:56] me there's a life that jumps inside of
[1:45:58] me we don't have to tell people right I
[1:46:03] don't have to tell people I'm a
[1:46:04] Christian people will start apologizing
[1:46:06] for swearing when they're talking around
[1:46:09] me yes and they'll say I'm sorry I don't
[1:46:11] even know why I I
[1:46:16] SAR we won't have to tell people I'm a
[1:46:20] Christian I believe the message I'm a
[1:46:22] message believer
[1:46:24] believer we're like the king and priest
[1:46:26] the high priest that walks that has on
[1:46:29] the bottom of His Garment a a
[1:46:31] pomegranate and a bell made of gold and
[1:46:34] a pomegranate and a bell made of gold
[1:46:36] and a pomegranate and a bell made of
[1:46:38] gold could you imagine wearing a robe
[1:46:40] like that where you walk and every time
[1:46:42] you walk your legs on the front Jingles
[1:46:45] the bells and the back Jingles the bells
[1:46:48] jingle jingle jingle
[1:46:51] jingle we know that the word says that
[1:46:54] his walk is supposed to say supposed to
[1:46:57] declare holy holy holy art thou Lord God
[1:47:03] Almighty and that's no different for the
[1:47:05] Bride of Jesus Christ brothers and
[1:47:06] sisters think about that when we live in
[1:47:08] this world when we're at the grocery
[1:47:10] store when we're driving in our cars
[1:47:12] when we're with our family at home is
[1:47:14] our life echoing that sound of holy holy
[1:47:19] holy is the Lord God Almighty because
[1:47:22] when that begins to happen then this
[1:47:24] word has moved from head knowledge to an
[1:47:28] intimate relationship inside of our
[1:47:30] heart where we become a new creature we
[1:47:33] can say we're a new creature in Christ
[1:47:35] because we believe the message all we
[1:47:37] want but the actions in our lives will
[1:47:41] show the world exactly who we
[1:47:44] are the people around us will tell us
[1:47:47] wow there's something different about
[1:47:51] you I I I I think it's wonderful when
[1:47:54] when they do when they can recognize it
[1:47:56] and and you know we look at it and think
[1:47:58] wow I didn't even realize that maybe it
[1:48:00] wasn't so uh so visible to me it's like
[1:48:05] children when they grow children love it
[1:48:08] when they get around grandparents or
[1:48:10] aunts or uncles or people they'd never
[1:48:11] seen for a long time they say wow you've
[1:48:14] grown so much look at you how much
[1:48:16] you've grown up last time I saw you you
[1:48:19] were This Tall etc etc and the child's
[1:48:21] like you know H not getting embarrassed
[1:48:25] and not sure how to take it but you know
[1:48:27] brothers and sisters they can't see it
[1:48:30] because it happen so gradually in their
[1:48:32] lives it's the same thing for the
[1:48:34] Believers if we just keep pressing on
[1:48:37] like the prophet said the people that
[1:48:39] were beyond the curtain of time they
[1:48:40] just kept saying to him keep pressing
[1:48:44] on keep preaching what Paul preached
[1:48:46] because that's where we stand that's
[1:48:48] where we believe we're resting on that
[1:48:53] I think it's so beautiful we can look at
[1:48:55] this from a legalistic perspective and
[1:48:57] I'm not preaching it from that I'll
[1:48:59] never do that I think the word is uh
[1:49:03] maybe for some people they could have
[1:49:05] the perception that the word is a little
[1:49:06] bit legalistic but you know when you
[1:49:09] actually do get the spirit of Christ in
[1:49:11] you it becomes a a a love of the word
[1:49:16] and it's not
[1:49:17] laborious Jesus told the people you know
[1:49:19] what my my my burden is light my my yoke
[1:49:22] is e easy you you just if you come and
[1:49:24] and try and live with me try and walk
[1:49:26] with me and see what happens my yoke is
[1:49:29] easy and my burden is light see if I
[1:49:32] won't try and help you carry the
[1:49:35] load I I think it's wonderful to look at
[1:49:37] this and you know he said to them he
[1:49:41] said to these people the the religious
[1:49:43] people if you continue in my word then
[1:49:45] ye are my disciples and you shall know
[1:49:48] the truth and the truth shall make you
[1:49:49] free first you've got to continue in his
[1:49:51] word many people don't want to continue
[1:49:54] in his word today we know this I'm
[1:49:55] preaching to the choir here about
[1:49:57] cutting hair and wearing pants and and
[1:50:00] we could say all of that about the
[1:50:02] homosexuality and and the lgbtq and all
[1:50:05] the rights all of that we know all of
[1:50:07] that that that's not where we need to go
[1:50:09] we know that the letter kth if we were
[1:50:12] to get legalistic and and punch a a a
[1:50:15] pile of notes on the wall and say this
[1:50:16] is what we believe put it on our website
[1:50:19] this is what we believe you know people
[1:50:21] probably would get grossed out because
[1:50:23] they would say it's a bunch of legalists
[1:50:25] that's not what we do we preach Christ
[1:50:27] crucified just like Paul preached and
[1:50:30] when that happens we want to line up
[1:50:32] with the word
[1:50:34] amen and how do we do that we follow the
[1:50:37] word of the Vindicated
[1:50:38] prophet he sent a prophet in this age to
[1:50:41] call us back to Center and those people
[1:50:44] that were called before the foundation
[1:50:45] of the world would be able to hear
[1:50:48] that but you know the scripture says it
[1:50:51] that the letter killing
[1:50:53] but the spirit giveth
[1:50:56] life if we think we're going to live a
[1:50:58] legalistic life and have the spirit of
[1:51:02] Christ in
[1:51:03] us and still turn around and do a a
[1:51:06] Shifty deal or something just maybe you
[1:51:09] know we were talking about this a little
[1:51:11] while ago I think it's interesting how
[1:51:13] folks will like to skirt the the laws of
[1:51:16] the land and think that they're pleasing
[1:51:20] God you're not pleasing God when you
[1:51:23] actually bend the rules and you
[1:51:25] manipulate and you swim into the gray
[1:51:27] areas you know God can't bless us the
[1:51:30] way that he wants to bless us when we're
[1:51:31] willing to do that well I just don't
[1:51:34] declare all those on my taxes or I I
[1:51:37] just manipulate this in such a way to
[1:51:39] make it look like that and you know it's
[1:51:41] okay it's not okay in the sight of God
[1:51:44] he sees it and there's a blessing that
[1:51:47] you're actually removing from your life
[1:51:49] because of it and usually where it comes
[1:51:52] from from is a legalistic perspective
[1:51:55] I'm going to understand the laws of the
[1:51:57] land and I'm going to try and stretch
[1:51:58] them and bend them as far as I can to
[1:52:00] manipulate it to benefit
[1:52:02] me I say give it all to God and see if
[1:52:05] he won't bless
[1:52:06] us he took the coin that day and told
[1:52:09] his disciples whose inscription is on
[1:52:13] this coin who do you see there he said
[1:52:16] Caesars they said Caesars and he said
[1:52:18] Render unto Caesar what's Caesars but
[1:52:21] give God what's God's
[1:52:23] amen
[1:52:26] amen you know when we uh when we live
[1:52:29] the life according to the word for our
[1:52:31] day when when the letter we know kth and
[1:52:35] the spirit that's living inside of us is
[1:52:37] giving us life it causes people to be
[1:52:40] attracted to us and it's interesting
[1:52:43] because on on the other side of the coin
[1:52:45] it also repels
[1:52:47] people but it's beautiful because in
[1:52:49] John 6:37 all that the father giveth me
[1:52:52] shall come to me and him that cometh to
[1:52:55] me will I in no wise cast out it's such
[1:52:58] a beautiful thing to know that you know
[1:53:00] we have that place of rest all that the
[1:53:03] father has given Jesus will come to him
[1:53:06] isn't that beautiful we can sing that
[1:53:09] song in the name of Jesus we have the
[1:53:13] Victory and we truly do don't
[1:53:16] we Jesus Jesus there's just something
[1:53:20] about I want to say it this way I don't
[1:53:22] know maybe someone would get upset by it
[1:53:24] but if you would sing that song change
[1:53:26] it from the name to your name there's
[1:53:29] something about your name make it first
[1:53:32] person brothers and sisters it's just
[1:53:34] such a wonderful song to think about
[1:53:36] though when we sing there's something
[1:53:38] about his name that name is above every
[1:53:42] name
[1:53:43] my you know looking at our scripture
[1:53:45] today go on back to the scripture the
[1:53:48] truth shall make you free there I just
[1:53:51] looked at two words and uh one of them
[1:53:53] is make it's
[1:53:57] g659 it's l Uther oo I don't know if I
[1:54:01] word that right but it's g659 anyways if
[1:54:05] uh if anyone's interested and it says to
[1:54:08] liberate figuratively to exempt from
[1:54:12] moral ceremonial or Mortal
[1:54:16] liability to deliver make free I just
[1:54:20] think that's such a beautiful thought to
[1:54:23] know that there is a
[1:54:25] Liberation because we know this where
[1:54:28] the spirit of the Lord is there
[1:54:31] is and sometimes we can look at that and
[1:54:33] we can interpret it and say yes I've got
[1:54:35] Liberty I can clap and I can move and
[1:54:38] maybe I can raise my hands maybe I can
[1:54:40] jump up and down maybe I just have to
[1:54:42] run maybe I just have to scream maybe I
[1:54:44] just have to weep maybe I just have to
[1:54:46] quietly stand still and not do anything
[1:54:49] whatever it is there's liberty to do
[1:54:51] that but brother and sisters it goes
[1:54:53] farther than that we can have the
[1:54:55] liberty of his spirit in US knowing that
[1:54:58] every single situation that we encounter
[1:55:00] in our lives he is in control
[1:55:05] ofallah I think it's beautiful to look
[1:55:07] at this word make free the truth shall
[1:55:10] make you free and and and if you take a
[1:55:13] look at the word free I was surprised I
[1:55:15] had to go back I scratched my head and
[1:55:17] and looked twice and thought am I crazy
[1:55:20] maybe I was just up too early maybe
[1:55:22] something's wrong I don't know what's
[1:55:24] going on here but if you look at the
[1:55:25] word free it's
[1:55:29] g659 l u the
[1:55:32] oo the word free is the same as
[1:55:36] make to liberate figuratively to exempt
[1:55:40] from moral ceremonial or Mortal
[1:55:43] liability to deliver to make free isn't
[1:55:46] that exactly what Jesus was doing when
[1:55:48] he stood before those church members and
[1:55:50] told them if you abide in me and my word
[1:55:53] abides in you just ask what you
[1:55:56] want now I know he didn't say that here
[1:55:58] in John chapter 8 so I apologize I just
[1:56:00] got inspired but he told them if you
[1:56:03] continue in my word then ye are my
[1:56:06] disciples
[1:56:07] indeed here he was just giving them a
[1:56:11] little bit of milk he was just telling
[1:56:13] them you know just enough to get them
[1:56:15] interested to cause them to come a
[1:56:17] little bit higher and and I think it's
[1:56:19] so beautiful and when you do that when
[1:56:21] you know that you're his disciple when
[1:56:22] you're following him then that truth
[1:56:25] that you're following will make you to
[1:56:27] be free you will have that Liberty in
[1:56:30] your
[1:56:32] life I think it's such a beautiful thing
[1:56:37] my you know
[1:56:40] uh brother Bram he talks about how
[1:56:43] incredible it
[1:56:46] is how incredible it is that the
[1:56:50] disciples they knew Jesus
[1:56:53] they knew him by
[1:56:55] relationship but Paul he never met Jesus
[1:56:59] by relationship he never met
[1:57:01] Jesus
[1:57:04] by Fellowship as a person did he the
[1:57:08] disciples they knew Jesus and they wrote
[1:57:11] about him Paul he actually met Jesus in
[1:57:16] the pillar of
[1:57:17] fire this is something that I want to
[1:57:19] preach on in a little while I think it's
[1:57:21] so incredibly beautiful isn't it
[1:57:23] wonderful to think how some can come to
[1:57:26] know Jesus by the letter by seeing him
[1:57:29] in person they can come to know him by
[1:57:31] his voice by his physical
[1:57:33] characteristics they they can even go to
[1:57:36] the place where maybe they see signs and
[1:57:38] wonders in their lives but I believe
[1:57:41] brothers and sisters it's next level
[1:57:43] when it becomes like Paul where we can
[1:57:45] actually know him by Revelation when we
[1:57:48] know him by revelation we can actually
[1:57:51] move into that Apostolic State it's such
[1:57:54] a beautiful thing to know the letter kth
[1:57:57] the Old Testament letter kth but the
[1:57:59] spirit of Jesus Christ gives life I just
[1:58:03] wanted to turn over to Luke chapter 4
[1:58:05] this morning if you don't mind turning
[1:58:07] there with me Luke chap
[1:58:10] 4 verse 18 my in the last few
[1:58:16] minutes Luke chapter
[1:58:19] 4 verse 18
[1:58:26] Jesus speaking
[1:58:35] here the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:58:38] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:58:41] the gospel to the
[1:58:43] poor he hath sent me to heal the
[1:58:46] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:58:49] the
[1:58:50] captives and recovering of sight to the
[1:58:55] blind to set at
[1:58:57] Liberty them that are bruised amen isn't
[1:59:01] that wonderful to preach the acceptable
[1:59:05] year of the
[1:59:06] Lord and he closed the book and gave it
[1:59:09] again to the minister and sat
[1:59:12] down and the eyes of all them that were
[1:59:16] in the synagogue were fastened on
[1:59:19] him and he began to say unto them this
[1:59:24] day is this scripture fulfilled in your
[1:59:29] ears if you're wondering about this
[1:59:32] there's a tremendous message in 1965 we
[1:59:35] all probably are well familiar with it
[1:59:37] this day this scripture is fulfilled he
[1:59:40] preaches it a couple of times it's a
[1:59:43] tremendous tremendous message and you
[1:59:46] know brother Bram he takes it and he
[1:59:48] begins to talk about all of this and he
[1:59:51] says there's a reason why he closed the
[1:59:53] book at that place if if you'll just
[1:59:55] turn over to Isaiah chapter
[1:59:59] 61 Jesus wasn't bringing a new scripture
[2:00:03] when he was there in the flesh that's
[2:00:05] right amen all he did was point back to
[2:00:08] the word and that's all a true leader
[2:00:12] will do is point back to the word that's
[2:00:14] what we've been reading about on
[2:00:16] Wednesday nights brother brandham
[2:00:17] inspired by the Holy Ghost a true leader
[2:00:20] will not bind people to to himself a
[2:00:23] true leader will not say that people
[2:00:25] need to pay homage to me a true leader
[2:00:27] will Point people to Jesus
[2:00:30] Christ amen Isaiah 61 verse one the
[2:00:35] spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[2:00:37] because the Lord hath anointed me to
[2:00:40] preach Good Tidings unto the meek he
[2:00:43] hath sent me to bind up the
[2:00:46] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[2:00:49] captives and the opening of the prison
[2:00:53] to them that are bound Amen to proclaim
[2:00:56] the acceptable year of the Lord and
[2:00:58] remember that's where he closed the book
[2:00:59] and sat down and he said all of that
[2:01:03] that I've said already has been
[2:01:05] fulfilled in your
[2:01:07] eyesall everything that the prophet said
[2:01:10] should happen when I come has already
[2:01:14] happened but he didn't finish this verse
[2:01:16] brother brandom says it the second half
[2:01:18] of this verse and the day of vengeance
[2:01:21] of our God to comfort all that mourn we
[2:01:25] know that day is coming it's coming very
[2:01:28] very soon and that's why we're here
[2:01:30] today brothers and sisters to recognize
[2:01:32] our position there is coming a day where
[2:01:35] this this world will no longer be our
[2:01:37] home and I think it's so beautiful
[2:01:39] because brother Bram he says it it's
[2:01:41] going to be just like we're walking
[2:01:42] stepping off a curb we're not doing
[2:01:44] something special sometimes we have
[2:01:46] services and it feels like we're going
[2:01:47] to Rapture it feels like those
[2:01:49] dimensions are blending and that's
[2:01:50] because they are I can't help but think
[2:01:53] we have all those that have gone on
[2:01:54] before us are leaning over the banisters
[2:01:56] of Heaven saying keep pressing on Amen
[2:01:59] listen to them worship they haven't even
[2:02:01] seen what we're experiencing but yet
[2:02:03] they're still praising keep praising
[2:02:06] don't give in brothers and
[2:02:08] sisters the day of Vengeance of our God
[2:02:11] to comfort all that MN that day is
[2:02:13] coming it's never been closer this is no
[2:02:16] time to get weary no time to to need to
[2:02:18] just take a step backwards this is time
[2:02:21] to press on
[2:02:22] to press forwards to press on to the
[2:02:24] mark for the prize of the High Calling
[2:02:26] of God in Christ
[2:02:27] Jesus not the word not just this this
[2:02:30] church not just something that we do on
[2:02:32] our own but to know exactly it is Christ
[2:02:35] Jesus amen hallelujah I just think this
[2:02:38] is such a beautiful topic here that's
[2:02:41] right and we have to close soon my out
[2:02:44] of the unveiling of God uh you know I'm
[2:02:47] probably not going to
[2:02:52] I'm
[2:02:55] sorry if you if you uh if you listen to
[2:03:00] the unveiling of God brother Bram he
[2:03:02] preaches from 19 uh Philippians 19
[2:03:05] chapter
[2:03:07] 2 um actually it's it's Chapter 19 Verse
[2:03:12] two and then he preaches out of 2
[2:03:14] Corinthians the third chapter beginning
[2:03:16] with the sixth verse and uh I'm just
[2:03:19] going to say this just for the sake of
[2:03:20] time he says who also has made us able
[2:03:24] Ministers of the New Testament not of
[2:03:26] the letter but of the spirit for the
[2:03:28] letter kth but the spirit giveth life
[2:03:30] but if the ministration of death written
[2:03:32] and engraven in Stones was glorious
[2:03:35] talking about the ten commandments so
[2:03:36] that the children of Israel could not
[2:03:38] steadfast behold the face of Moses for
[2:03:40] the glory of his countenance which Glory
[2:03:42] was to be done away how shall not the
[2:03:44] ministration of the spirit be rather
[2:03:46] glorious amen I can say it is we can all
[2:03:49] witness that it is for the if the
[2:03:51] ministration of condemnation be glorious
[2:03:55] much more does the ministration of
[2:03:57] righteousness exceed in glory for even
[2:04:00] that which was made glorious has no
[2:04:02] glory in this Respect by reasons of the
[2:04:05] glory that excelth for if that which is
[2:04:08] done away was Glory how much more hath
[2:04:11] which remaineth is Glory seeing then we
[2:04:14] have this have such a hope we must
[2:04:17] greatly plainness of speech use great
[2:04:19] plainness of speech and and not as Moses
[2:04:23] which put a veil over his face that the
[2:04:25] children of Israel could not steadfastly
[2:04:27] look to the end of that which was
[2:04:29] abolished but if their minds were
[2:04:31] blinded For unto this day remaineth the
[2:04:34] same Veil untaken away in the reading of
[2:04:37] the Old Testament which Veil is done
[2:04:39] away in Christ but even unto this day
[2:04:42] when Moses is read the veil is upon
[2:04:44] their hearts nevertheless when it shall
[2:04:46] be turned to the Lord the veil shall be
[2:04:48] taken away and any day now brothers and
[2:04:51] sisters that Veil is going to be taken
[2:04:52] away there's going to be two witnesses
[2:04:54] two prophets in the land of Israel
[2:04:57] preaching this word taking that Veil
[2:04:59] away amen now the Lord is that spirit
[2:05:05] and where the spirit of the Lord there
[2:05:07] is Liberty but we all with open face
[2:05:11] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[2:05:14] Lord has changed into the same image
[2:05:16] from Glory unto Glory even as by the
[2:05:19] spirit of the Lord therefore seeing we
[2:05:21] have this ministry as we have received
[2:05:23] Mercy we faint not we were talking about
[2:05:27] that before service the more Mercy the
[2:05:29] more grace we receive it it just causes
[2:05:31] us to become more and more faint it
[2:05:33] causes us to to to just be more and more
[2:05:35] humbled to recognize there's nothing
[2:05:37] that we've ever
[2:05:39] done but have renounced the hidden
[2:05:41] things and the
[2:05:44] dishonest not walking in craftiness and
[2:05:47] handling the word of God
[2:05:50] deceitfully but by manifestation of the
[2:05:54] truth condemning ourselves to Every
[2:05:57] Man's conscience in the sight of
[2:06:00] God but if our gospel be hid it's hid to
[2:06:03] them which are
[2:06:05] lost I think it's so beautiful such a
[2:06:08] tremendous
[2:06:10] thing you know brothers and sisters when
[2:06:12] when Jesus was here on Earth he actually
[2:06:16] said to them right after this in in John
[2:06:19] chapter 8 you know we began to talk
[2:06:22] about the bread from heaven and he told
[2:06:23] them that unless you eat my flesh and
[2:06:25] you drink my blood you have no no no
[2:06:27] part in me and they said you know he's a
[2:06:30] vampire he's a bad guy he's going
[2:06:32] against the law of Moses how could he
[2:06:33] ever do this but they didn't recognize
[2:06:36] that the the law was turning a corner
[2:06:38] the word of God was actually changing a
[2:06:41] dispensation was making a turn
[2:06:46] amen people said brother Bram said that
[2:06:51] Jes Jesus would do that God would just
[2:06:53] do that he didn't even explain to the
[2:06:55] people he didn't say to them this is why
[2:06:57] I'm saying it because I know not
[2:06:59] everyone can actually walk all the way
[2:07:01] with me not everyone is actually going
[2:07:03] to be truly a son or a daughter in fact
[2:07:06] some are actually Devils but he didn't
[2:07:08] say it brother bam said he didn't even
[2:07:09] explain it at all he just told them
[2:07:11] unless you eat my flesh and you drink my
[2:07:13] blood you got no life in you what how
[2:07:17] could you say such a thing that's
[2:07:18] terrible to say but he did it that way
[2:07:21] for a purpose if you hear what brother
[2:07:22] bradam says out of out of the unveiling
[2:07:24] of God he says now my subject this
[2:07:26] morning I trust God will reveal this and
[2:07:29] I trust that God will reveal it too it's
[2:07:31] got to be God that reveals it brothers
[2:07:33] and sisters it can't be brother Barry it
[2:07:35] can't be our parents it can't be our
[2:07:37] Sunday school teachers it's got to be
[2:07:39] God that reveals this and each time if
[2:07:42] you take the tapes and listen and I hope
[2:07:44] and trust that you have had a spiritual
[2:07:47] understanding of what God has been
[2:07:48] trying to get over to the church without
[2:07:51] saying saying it outright see it's a
[2:07:54] thing he doesn't come right out and say
[2:07:57] it he says sometime we have to say
[2:07:59] things in such a way that it might thin
[2:08:02] down that it might bring some to go out
[2:08:05] some to leave and some to ponder over
[2:08:08] but it's done purposely it must be done
[2:08:11] that
[2:08:12] way then it might be that some would say
[2:08:15] you mean God would purposely do a thing
[2:08:17] like that he said he certainly did he
[2:08:20] does yes
[2:08:22] that's why I love it brothers and
[2:08:23] sisters I love it I'll never stop
[2:08:25] harping on the Holy Ghost I'll never
[2:08:27] stop preaching Christ crucified died and
[2:08:30] rose again on the third day for the
[2:08:32] purpose of actually giving us the Holy
[2:08:34] Ghost sending us the comforter so that
[2:08:36] we have the earnest of our Salvation so
[2:08:40] that we can see that God is real he is
[2:08:42] tangible I can see him in my life if you
[2:08:45] haven't been able to experience him that
[2:08:47] way then I pray that you'll be able to
[2:08:49] and if you have been able to experience
[2:08:51] that way then I trust you can say Amen
[2:08:53] to that because that's the only thing we
[2:08:56] need is the Holy Ghost In Our Lives when
[2:08:58] he the spirit of truth comes he will
[2:09:00] lead us and guide us into all truth I'll
[2:09:03] call the musicians I have one more quote
[2:09:05] that I want to read though I think it's
[2:09:07] so important I can't let it go brothers
[2:09:10] and
[2:09:11] sisters
[2:09:12] Glory it's so beautiful it's out of this
[2:09:15] message and uh it's so
[2:09:19] good you know brother bradam he says and
[2:09:23] and I mean this is at the end of it end
[2:09:26] of the message the unveiling of God and
[2:09:30] and he says it that we identify with the
[2:09:33] spirit of the country that we're from
[2:09:35] and he's talking about being American if
[2:09:37] you're an American then you identify
[2:09:40] with the American Spirit and you know
[2:09:42] being Canadian we identify with the
[2:09:44] Canadian Spirit whether we like it or
[2:09:46] not that is the way it is that doesn't
[2:09:49] mean that we identify with Prime
[2:09:51] Minister Trudeau's Spirit or that we
[2:09:53] identify with President Trump's spirit
[2:09:56] it's the American Spirit or the Canadian
[2:09:58] Spirit or the German or French whatever
[2:10:01] the country is but brother Bram says and
[2:10:04] as a Christian I'm identified with
[2:10:08] him yes he talks about identifying as an
[2:10:11] American and and identifying with George
[2:10:14] Washington when he crossed the Delaware
[2:10:15] and bare feet he talks about identifying
[2:10:18] with all of the great situations that
[2:10:20] happened in the US us because as a US
[2:10:23] citizen you have to just like in Canada
[2:10:25] we have to identify with all the
[2:10:27] Canadian history and brother bradam he
[2:10:29] changes it now and he goes into being a
[2:10:31] Christian identifying as a Christian
[2:10:33] maybe stand with me today I think it's
[2:10:35] so beautiful when you look at the
[2:10:36] identification because here we live in a
[2:10:39] world where everyone's trying to
[2:10:41] identify everyone says what's your
[2:10:44] identity how do you
[2:10:47] identify I love that question because I
[2:10:49] identify as I am
[2:10:52] I am brother Bram says and as a
[2:10:54] Christian I'm identified with him amen I
[2:10:58] was with Noah when he went into the ark
[2:11:00] I was with Moses when he come out of
[2:11:02] Egypt amen I Was Elijah on Mount Carmel
[2:11:06] isn't it beautiful he says I Was Elijah
[2:11:09] on Mount
[2:11:10] Carmel yes sir glory to God I was with
[2:11:14] him when he did that I was truly with
[2:11:17] him I identified myself in his death
[2:11:20] there on Cal
[2:11:22] and this is so beautiful brothers and
[2:11:23] sisters when I died to the things of the
[2:11:26] world Amen to myself to all Traditions
[2:11:30] amen I was identified with him I was
[2:11:34] identified with him on Easter morning
[2:11:36] when he rose from the dead I was
[2:11:37] identified with him on the day of
[2:11:39] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came down
[2:11:42] like a rushing Mighty Wind I'm sure we
[2:11:44] can all say amen amen I was identified
[2:11:47] with him all that he was I am amen all
[2:11:52] that I am he was amen being dead in him
[2:11:56] we are identified with him amen what he
[2:12:01] is I am glory to God I just can't help
[2:12:06] but think brothers and sisters when we
[2:12:08] read stuff like this he's not coming
[2:12:10] right out and telling us everything he's
[2:12:14] thinning it out I can't help but think
[2:12:16] brothers and sisters what does the
[2:12:18] second coming of Christ actually look
[2:12:21] like what does it look like what's it
[2:12:24] going to look like when we go and meet
[2:12:26] with him in the
[2:12:29] air I personally believe with all my
[2:12:31] heart it does not look any different
[2:12:33] than it does right now today on a cold
[2:12:35] miserable February day the brothers and
[2:12:38] sisters we look around and maybe some of
[2:12:41] us maybe feel a little better than
[2:12:43] others maybe some of us look a little
[2:12:44] better than
[2:12:45] others maybe some have good breath maybe
[2:12:48] some have bad breath you know brothers
[2:12:50] and sisters we're all Sinners saved by
[2:12:53] grace does not matter how much money
[2:12:55] we've got it doesn't matter how smart we
[2:12:57] are have you surrendered your life to
[2:13:00] Christ have you gotten all the way into
[2:13:03] Christ Jesus that's what matters that is
[2:13:06] the Crux of the message for today and
[2:13:09] not just today with brother Barry for
[2:13:11] this age in which we live because
[2:13:13] without Christ we're lost as lost can be
[2:13:15] brother bradam says without the Holy
[2:13:17] Ghost you're lost as lost can be I think
[2:13:20] it's so beautiful we have the
[2:13:21] opportunity to be identified with him
[2:13:24] because he says it right here what he is
[2:13:26] making it present tense what he is I am
[2:13:31] Godly bless you each one today as we
[2:13:33] close let's just bow in prayer Heavenly
[2:13:35] Father Lord we just are so thankful that
[2:13:38] you've given us this word in the day in
[2:13:39] which we live Lord to recognize that we
[2:13:42] don't need to be slapped around by the
[2:13:43] devil lord he's coming around on every
[2:13:46] front on every hand Lord everywhere we
[2:13:49] look we can see him but father we're so
[2:13:51] thankful that we can look away to Jesus
[2:13:54] we're so thankful that we can look away
[2:13:55] to you Lord and recognize the only
[2:13:58] reason he's coming after us is because
[2:14:00] he knows his time is so short that that
[2:14:03] day where we get taken up and he is cast
[2:14:05] down is just around the corner just like
[2:14:08] spring is coming so soon oh Father we

[2:14:50] would ident identify with that Lord that

[2:15:01] resurrection and the Rapture is already
[2:15:04] happening because I can see a
[2:15:05] resurrection of your life inside of me
