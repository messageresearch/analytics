lightly father we don't take them for granted and father if we ever have taken them lightly or for granted we ask that you would forgive us now in the name of Jesus Amen we know that everything could

it all under your control and we trust you that way father and we thank you for your goodness and your Tender Mercies to each and every one of us Lord Jesus because we know that if we are truly very elected it's only because of your grace your thoughts about us before the foundation of this world that we are able to recognize that Lord and father for that reason we just love to give you praise Lord father we could spend the whole service just worshiping you Lord Jesus and it still wouldn't be enough yesen father we love you and we thank you today we just ask that you would meet each and

each and every need father we know that you are able we love you and we thank you we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen God bless you today thank you musicians if you have your Bibles I just would like to read from the book of Hebrews chapter 6 this morning as we continue on with our discussion about the Holy Ghost and uh probably the second half of the questions and answers on the Holy Ghost today from the Holy Ghost series just after the holy the Holy Ghost series was preached this was 1959 1219 questions and answers on the Holy Ghost um preached right after the Holy Ghost series Hebrews chapter 6 verse 1 says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection amen not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and and of Faith toward God and of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this we will do if God permit for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come amen if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh of upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God but that that which beareth thorns and Briars is rejected and as nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned let's just bow one more time amen gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your word we thank you Lord Jesus for the word that was delivered to this age father specifically understanding the age in which we live in Lord we just ask that you would bless the word that was spoken father that you would open it to us you would break this bread of life to us freshh once again Lord Jesus that we could Feast on the unfailing body word of the Lord Jesus Christ once again we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated just a few announcements we have the Easter services coming up brother David Dean har will be here next weekend he'll be here for Friday service Saturday service and a Sunday morning service uh both of Friday sorry yeah Friday Saturday and Sunday then in April the 20th and 21st we will have brother Nestor espania from Philippines he'll be here the 20th and the 21st Sunday June the 2nd we'll have brother Dela ad adalon he's the pastor from Nigeria he'll be here for Sunday June the 2nd and uh we have have a little Revival that's going to take place in Lethbridge and that's going to happen April 12th 13th and 14th there's going to be a Friday night service and I will take that service there will that will be from 6:00 till 9:00 p.m. and then there will be uh three services on Saturday one will be 9 to 12 one will be 2: to 4:30 and then 6:00 to 8:30 and uh there will be a few Brothers taking those services and April the 14th the Sunday will be 10 to 4 10 to 1 p.m not 4 sorry 10 to 1 pm and that will be uh again in Lethbridge and brother Jerry Fury will be coming down from uh Spruce Grove to take that service and uh I apologize I can't remember exactly who's taking the services on Saturday I believe that brother Jerry's taken one or two of them but there will be a flyer that will be coming out to actually uh have the formal announcement and the address and uh hope hopefully an RSVP if anyone would like to attend just so there's an idea of how many people will be attending there's has to be two two separate venues for it it's just the way things worked out down there um and yeah we'll have those details to follow uh just a couple of notes that I apologize for not bringing forward sooner from the men's meeting um we're going to start with regular prayer meetings every Thursday at the first Thursday of every month starting a April um so we will begin uh prayer meetings every single Thursday the first Thursday I mean the first Thursday of every single month that's what I'm trying to say in uh in the future so we'll start that April the 4th um and also the communion service was a big topic of conversation that we had during the men's meeting and so we had agreed that we would do a 5:30 start instead of 6:00 and so I do apologize for those people who might be up set because I didn't announce it sooner but we'll have the communion service tonight at 5:30 instead of 6:00 so that we'll have a little bit more time to actually facilitate the service as well as hopefully get everyone on the road back home again at a decent time those people especially with children so if you do come late tonight we will understand it's okay um if a half an hour is going to throw us off that far I do apologize that's my mistake but moving forward we will have communion services at 5:30 one of the other things was that we were going to supply more buckets for foot washing so that we could be more efficient when that time of the service arrives so I trust that we have the buckets in store and uh it should be more efficient for us as well and uh the other thing that was mentioned was we can communicate when we're done somehow there's been a lack of communication between the brothers and the sisters the sisters downstairs and the brothers upstairs I think the brothers have been afraid to go downstairs because of the sisters doing the foot washing but the foot washing is is actually taking place now in the kitchen area so it's kind of behind a closed door I don't think there's going to be anything unts if a brother were to go downstairs and just knock on the door and say we're finished upstairs so um and likewise upstairs if his sister comes up it's fine so uh communication when we're done with the foot washing we want to uh create an environment for this service so that we can give room for testimonies it was a it was a discussion about whether we should have a testimony service separate or whether we should keep it as the communion service and uh I believe it turned into we'll keep it as the communion service with testimonies we'll just give it a little bit more time we'll just maybe see if everyone can be a little more thoughtful with their testimonies so that we don't actually just burn through a bunch of time and the discussion is actually meaningful and uh efficient so I hope that is actually okay um again I do apologize it's my mistake for not bringing it any sooner but like I said if you do decide to come later be because you didn't know before now that's just okay there's no pressure God richly bless you are you happy this morning amen we're going to continue on with our discussion about the uh questions and answers on the Hebrews series on the uh on the Holy Ghost series I do apologize I have really enjoyed this it's been uh a real blessing to me just a real encouragement to see what the prophet has said about this amen I believe the Lord led me to go this way with it and uh you know sometimes as a minister I guess even as a pastor you have to wonder because the devil loves to come around on Monday morning and Thursday morning especially but every other day of the week as well just like everyone but I believe there's a a little bit of a special uh a special portion for the minister for the pastor to wonder whether you're actually doing what God wants you to do whether it's exactly the way God wants you to say it and the one thing that I've learned is the best thing that can ever happen is just to surrender and just let the Lord do it and uh we were talking about it last week brother dawn going into service and you know a lot of the things that are said what Brother Don said were actually on his notes it's not following necessarily a script it's allowing the Holy Ghost to actually lead and it's so important for that to be the case in a Church uh we've talked about it in the past and uh I think even on Wednesday especially with the study of the exposition of the seven Church ages there is the Deeds of the nicians and that's the thing that God hates and that is the leadership of man over man that is where we start to get political and that is where we start to get powerful and that just stops the Holy Ghost right there and the Church of the Living God the message of the hour was sent to actually deliver the people from those bars of bondage of the Deeds of the nictitans and we know brother Bram he had that that that Vision where he said he saw those people trapped behind those bars I can't remember what the message is it's in 1965 though and it's where he sees those people and they're good people and they're tra behind those bars and they can't seem to get out and we know that brother Bram in the end he had the Lord tell him deliver those people oh God and he said House of Hell amen deliver those people in the name of Jesus Christ and he said he could hear the Rocks rolling and the bars bending and those people came out and they were delivered they were good people and I believe it's the same thing for us if we're not careful we can substitute power for programs we can start to say we're going to organize we heard it on Wednesday There's a a little clip in the church age book where you can see that God has moved in your midst and that's where the Devil comes in that Antichrist spirit and Whispers and says now you've got it with you now organize and write it in a book create a program create an Avenue for this Holy Spirit to continue on you've got to protect it brothers and sisters we don't have to protect his word one one second in fact if we do that we get in the way because his word is quick and Powerful it's sharper than any two-edged sword and it's sent to deliver us in the day in which we live amen but talking about questions and answers on the Holy Ghost just a little recap from last time we were ministering here uh thank you brother dawn for expressing all that the Lord placed on your heart from last week really enjoyed that so many points from that you know we can so many points just one thing I wanted to just mention before I get going here is how many of us have created a spiritual ishill in our lives did you catch that part last week we can create our own Avenue for God to move we can say we know that this is what God Said God sent a prophet and he gave us instructions to do it a certain way but we can say well it's just not coming to pass as soon as I want it to so I'm just going to do it the way that I want to do it the way that maybe my wife suggests that we should do it and and it'll turn out just fine but what happens is we create a spiritual ishill I thought that was so good and we know the whole world is reeling from that situation even today how much does that impact us as Sons and Daughters of the most high God but you know uh just going back in in what we were talking about a little bit of a recap from questions and answers on the Holy Ghost brother Bram he starts in this message talking about how you can you can look at the the Jews and the Hebrews and then you can look at the Gentiles and and the anointing that was on the Gentiles in jesus' day was there there was a few different times where people simply spoke the word the Jews wanted the laying on of hands but but the Gentiles the anointing for the Gentiles is to simply speak the word and we know that brother Brown he gives a few different examples for it um the Gentiles who who were at cornelius's house and and while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them and and the little girl gyrus his daughter you know he said come and lay hands on her but the Roman centor he said I'm not worthy that you come under my roof just speak the word the syrop phenician woman brother brandham says Greek she came and and wanted to actually have a touch from the master and he said you know what it's not meat for the master to feed the children's bread to the dogs called her a dog Gentile syrop phenician Greek dog but what did she say even the dogs eat the crumbs from the master's table speak the word Master that's all I need from you is one word from you and we know for this saying he said for this saying the devil's left your daughter and brother bradam he says quote say good things then say something good about somebody right talk about Jesus say something loyal something real he says that's the way to get rid of devils am so brothers and sisters if we're not saying something loyal something real if we're not speaking good about our brother and sister then I want to say it clearly we're actually passing Devils Back and Forth that's right we're passing Devils Back and Forth hey catch here's a devil who wants to do that it's a trick of the devil right let's do exactly what the devil doesn't want us to do let's say something nice amen the devil's going to come around and say look you just stubbed your toe man that guy just tripped you up something awful he just spit in your face say something nice say something like David said you know God told him to do that just to see what I would do that's the way to get rid of devils is what the prophet told us you know what he's got little little nuggets like this I'll call it a little nugget but I think this is a real big key to the success of a believer in the day in which we live we can talk smack about brothers and sisters and say well it's the truth they said that didn't they we know the prophet another one of those nuggets he would say well they didn't really mean it did they I don't think they really would have meant that because remember on this side we cannot see the real you you can't see the real me we just see this flesh that we're trapped in this is a hybrid condition say nice things brothers and sisters amen say nice things brother Bram he's you know given the question it's it's paragraph 100 in the in the Bible or the table app he says brother bradam please explain Hebrews 6 4-6 and that scripture is for it's impossible for those who were once enlightened have tasted of the Heavenly gift who were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again to repentance seeing they crucify to them themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame I just can't help but think you know when you get someone who is talking talking talking talking that's what they're doing they're crucifying to themselves not to the people they're talking to they're crucifying to themselves the Son of God aresh putting them to an open shame for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh of upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for it by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God but that which beareth thorns and Briars is rejected and is nigh un cursing whose end is to be burned you know you might say well why would you say that brother Barry how come are they crucifying to themselves because they're not actually blaspheming the prophet they're not blaspheming the scripture but I'll say it this way they're not actually displaying The Life of Christ because if they had the fruit of the spirit we would not be talking negative or evil about anyone right nobody questions and answers on the Holy Ghost brother Bram paragraph 163 he says now look if I want to go back to Ephesians the first chapter Paul preaching now the Corinthians each one had a tongue and a Psalm you notice the other churches didn't have that trouble he never said nothing about it did he ever mention tongues anywhere in the Ephesian Church the Roman Church no now I'm I'm going to try and swing back Circle back to that a little bit later on but if we look at it just just zooming out taking a look at it they had signs and wonders in the churches but Paul he didn't go back to correct the Romans or to correct the Ephesians they had the church set an order and how did they set it in order they had the Holy Ghost that's the only way they could have it set in order the only way but the other churches they got the little bit of nickan spirit in them they started to get a little bit out of order and they started to allow things in the church that maybe ordinarily wouldn't be allowed brothers and sisters I just want to say this loud and clear we believe the doctrine of William Mary and brandom because that is the doctrine of Jesus Christ we're not interested in making excuses for cutting hair for wearing garments that pertain to the other gender that's not what we're supposed to do because both is an Abomination if a man wears a garment that pertains to a woman if a woman wears a garment pertains to a man both of them are listed as Abominations in the word of God we don't make excuses for this we're we're not going to allow you know women or men to wear tight clothing if you're going to do that you've got the influence of the wrong Spirit usually it's a prideful Spirit sometimes it's it's in a it's in a physical connotation so people maybe they can see your muscles maybe they can see different parts of your body it's the wrong influence brothers and sisters if that's what we're doing we're not interested in making excuses for that we're the Church of the Living God am we want to follow the doctrine of Jesus Christ all the way to the letter the Ephesians Church didn't have that issue neither did the Roman Church brother brandham says questions and answers just just doing a recap from sort of where we were last week then I'm going to try and press forwards here I just want to quickly do this here paragraph 164 brother Bram he says and you say well what about the Pentecostals with the tongues then brother Bram I think that they got the Holy Ghost he says sure they did all right why look you believe he's a good god Thomas said one time you know Lord and and I love the way brother bradam says that you know because we know Thomas he was he was he's coined the doubting Thomas isn't he unless I see then I'll believe we don't want to get that spirit in our midst because that's a spirit brothers and sisters unless I see it that's the only way I'll believe it the only way you're going to be able to believe it is because he gives you the ability to believe it and if he gives you the ability to believe it blessed are your eyes because they're able to see the things of God Amen Hallelujah and we know that Jesus he said it in John 20 how much more blessed are they who haven't seen but still believe the reason for that is they're displaying the life of Jesus Christ that Gene seed of God is inside of them and when the anointed word comes it actually ignites that seed it cracks that seed open that seed begins to come to life because of that spirit because of that word we don't want to be a doubting Thomas brother bam he goes on to say in paragraph 165 he said yes Thomas after you've seen me and felt me and put put my hand and your hands in my side you believe but how much greater is their reward who have never seen and yet believed how many people here in this audience today in this congregation were able to see the Lord Jesus Christ none of us how many here were able to see William Mary and Bram in flesh I don't know if any of us but yet something inside of us wants to believe in what they brought to us now I'm not comparing William Mary and brandom to be equal with Jesus Christ for the record William Mariam Bram was the prophet of Jesus Christ he was introducing Jesus Christ but how many of us were able to see them none of us but we still have the ability to believe amen brother Bram he says he gives you the desire of your heart of course let's just believe him and he says that's another nugget here that's the death stroke to Satan when a man takes God at his word brother that'll kill Satan every time that's the hardest hitting Satan can get when a man will take God at his word yes sir I just think that's so powerful amen all these little nuggets are huge ones huge ones brother R he goes on to say leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection now he's been talking to them about the doctrines let's let let us go and talk about the perfect perfected things now you are perfected in God when you're sealed by the Holy Ghost until the day of your Redemption and that's why I I I just take encouragement I told you at the beginning I mentioned that sometimes I wonder and I'm sure many other people do you know is this right are we go in the right direction but when I I I I think that we've just focused on talking about the Holy Ghost so much it can almost seem like it's too much and I know the devil will come around and tell me yep it's just too much the people have heard it you got to move on you got to find something else but I have the spirit of God say but wait a second think about this just follow my leadership here and and when I read something like this I just think it's so beautiful he says let us go and talk about the per perfected things now you are perfected in God when you're sealed by the Holy Ghost until the day of your Redemption and we know Hebrews chap 6 verse one says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection amen let's not be worried about churchianity and doing all these things all of the Traditions the rudiments of of Christianity there comes a point in time where we've already done that and we need to move on brothers and sisters we know that John he was on the aisle of Pat was for the testimony of Jesus Christ and he was given an opportunity to come higher there was a door open in heaven for him and it's no different for the Bride of Jesus Christ the only thing is we're not seeing a a doorway in heaven we're not seeing a doorway anywhere except for Jesus Christ who said I am the way the truth and the life nobody comes onto the father except by me so where is he today we know he's in a word his word is our doorway into that higher Revelation but let's go on to perfected things now he says you're perfected in God when you're sealed by the Holy Ghost until the day of your Redemption he that's born of God first John does not commit sin for he cannot sin for the seed of God remains in him you cannot actually ever escape it if you are truly a son and daughter of God and you never really want to if you are a son and daughter of God but brother Bram he goes on to explaining the answer to this question please explain Hebrews 6: 4 to8 for it's impossible for those who were once enlightened have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost my and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again to repentance seeing they crucified if to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame brother Bram talks about a vision about Dr Davis and it's much later in the message and I'm just going to sort of Hit the highlights with this so that we can carry on I apologize brother Logan it's a little bit uh scattered maybe it seems but just bear with me um you could look up I said said wonder what that means I don't know if this uh was part of what I gave you this morning and I apologize but here we are brother bradam he says I wondered what that means brother Bram he he took he he he had a vision and and I think he talked to Brother Davis about this Brother Davis was actually mocking brother Bram and and and he went away to pray for Brother Davis he went up to his cave in in Greens Mill and we're all familiar with that he went away to actually pray for this man Brother Davis and brother branam he says it's paragraph 192 in in the app here he says I said I wonder what that means I just now I wasn't thinking about nothing up there I just that I and just then as I was sitting there I thought the Lord would give me a vision about Brother Davis and them down there and I was sitting there I looked and I seen something turning out across the hollow in front of me and it was a wh turning and I seen it was all broke up just looked like it was all plowed over and a man went forth with a great big thing in front of him full of seed and he was casting the seed all the way across the Earth as he went and he went around the curvature of the Earth and he went out of my sight and as soon as he went out of my sight here come a man real sneaky looking dressed in black garments going around like this going throwing bad seeds and I watched it and as the Earth kept turning around goes on to say after while wheat come up and when the wheat come up of there come briers and thistles and thorns and stinkweed and everything growed up growing up milk weeds and everything growing up in the wheat think about all those different weeds growing in the midst of the wheat many times we can read these and listen to these and and just it just can seem like a a story and it's a nice story but I think it's interesting how he names off all of these different weeds all of these different weeds in with the wheat we know the vision showed the wheat the good man sowing the wheat in the field but then suddenly this other man comes along and sews all these different kinds and we know it's confusion because something happens and then they all Sprout up but the BAM says and they was all growing together and there come a real bad Dro and the little wheat had its head over like that and the little Brier and Thistle and thorns and they had their head over each weed just pant pant pant breathing like that excuse me you could just hear them and they were calling for rain and after a while Along come a great big cloud and I think I could just preach on that for a while after a while Along come a great big CL loud how many different Wheats and weeds were crying for rain since the day of Pentecost brothers and sisters after a while come a a great big cloud and the water just gushed down and when it fell upon there that wheat jumped up and began to holler Glory Hallelujah praise the Lord up jumped the little stinkweed and hollered Glory praise the the Lord hallelujah all the thorns and all of them dancing all around over the field hollering Glory Hallelujah praise the Lord isn't it beautiful the way that he portrays this the way that he brings this because first it was the wheat it wasn't second right the stink weed didn't rise up and start praising God first it was the wheat right we know there's always a carnal impersonation of the truth and there's no way there can be an impersonation unless there is a truth the only way there's a counterfeit is for there to be a real he goes on to say well I said I can't get that the vision left me then I fell back on that again the Briars which is nigh unto rejection then I got it Jesus said the rain falls on the just and the unjust a man can sit in the meeting can speak with tongues can shout and act just like the rest of them now this one is tricky with the real genuine Holy Ghost and still not be in the kingdom of God right amen now remember we're talking about this person's question I believe it's number 100 in questions and answers on the questions and answers of the Holy Ghost paragraph 100 but it's it's the question is please explain the meaning of Hebrews 6: vers 4 to 8 it's impossible for those who were once enlightened they can have the Holy Ghost anointing and still not be in the kingdom of God that's exactly right Jesus didn't Jesus say many will stand in that day and say Lord have not I cast out devils in your name have not I prophesied preached in your name have not I done Mighty works in your name do you see the the theme there have not I have not I have not I there ain't no I in it brothers and sisters it's all him as soon as we try putting I in there that's where we stop the power of the Lord right yes the Holy Ghost steps back and says hey it's you go for it call me when you're ready I'll just be on the tree branch up here resting but more than likely he'll just be dealing with someone else who wants him to be there says that's exactly right didn't Jesus say many will stand in that day say Lord have not I cast out devils in your name have not I prophesied preached in your name I love how he says that prophesied preached in your name not just a prophet prophesying with their eyes closed prophesying Great and Mighty things maybe even little things somebody preaching in his name my have not I done Mighty works in your name Jesus said depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you how about that he says that's where brother Barry says brothers and sisters get to Christ get the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your life so you don't stand there on that day and say but Lord have not I didn't I don't you see what I did can't you see my legacy he's going to say I never even knew you yes sir you didn't have a you chose not to have you literally chose not to have a personal relationship with me so I don't even know you brothers and sisters the word no in the Bible is intimacy it's taking it to the next level having nothing between you and him husband and wife becoming one amen that's the requirement for our age we can't just come up to the borderline and say oh my there it is that's the Holy Ghost that's the promised land but I like the life that I live I'm just going to stay right here on this side you know what the word of God says that there's people that did that the children of Israel two tribes and their names were blotted out from under Heaven it doesn't mean that they were blotted out in heaven but the word of God says that their names were blotted out from under Heaven because they chose to stay back and not go all the way what happened was they got tied up in the world brother Brandon brings us out real clear in the message and you'd have to look it up I'm just going to preach now now we're going to get into the service but what they did was they got tied up with money they got tied up with politics baac and balum they got tied up in looking at the hinder parts of people and what happened they forfeited their their power for their programs they said we're going to do it our way we're not going to follow the leadership of the Prophet anymore and that's literally what happened they said we're not going to follow the leadership of the Prophet anymore how many people in our day would say that I'm just going to do it my way I'm not going to follow the leadership of the Prophet he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we're not going to be able to make excuses on that day and say but Lord I but Lord I didn't I he's going to say depart from me you worker of iniquity you knew better and you didn't do it you knew what to do but you chose not to that's why brothers and sisters I have to preach it this way we've got to get into Christ that's the only way truth and life the holy ghost or bust for us to be here partaking of this heavenly word of this heavenly gift it will be impossible for us who were once enlightened to ever redeem ourselves to ever go back it would be better in the word of God for us to never have known about this word than to have come right up to the edge and looked over and said my goodness it is true there are there are streams of milk and there are hives of honey and there's pomegranates and and bunches of grapes that they have have to carry with two men and there's pomegranates and there's figs oh my but we know what the problem was we'll get into this what they did was they started to look at all the natural elements they started to look at the Giants in the land they looked at the wild City they looked at all the different things even after God took them out of bondage they saw all the signs and wonders all the mighty Miracles but because 10 men said it the majority went with them well most of the men are saying this so we must go with them right we know the whole congregation two two two and and almost a half million people picked up stones to throw at Caleb and Joshua when they said we're more than able to God said we can do it what's the problem here right but we know that they were different weren't they yes they were there was something different about those boys wasn't there now some people will say that the Holy Ghost wasn't given yet so they can't have the Holy Ghost but I want to say they had the Holy Ghost because the word of God says they were of another spirit and he's the same yesterday today and forever you can't take him and cut him up and give them to a Believer it's either God or it's not they had an anointing they had the Holy Ghost in their life they had something driving them to the word of God and they weren't interested in anybody's opinion they weren't interested in committees and and theories and and the Deeds of the nicians they wanted nothing to do with any of it they said we're more than able God brought us out of bondage he promised us this land and he's given us this land it's right there and now you're going to Chick it out you're going to say that God isn't able to do it Lord have mercy brother Bram in in paragraph 168 he says a man that's filled with the Holy Ghost not thans he's filled this is where I just want to harp on it and I know I've harped on it I'm going to continue to harp on it know that you've got the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters brother bradam we read it last week or the week before he said it's not just an option it's not just optional to say maybe one of these days I'll get the Holy Ghost in my life and if I do if I don't it'll be okay I'll just come to church and everything will be fine my parents have the Holy Ghost my brothers and sisters everything is we can live off the experience of our brothers and our sisters and things will be good for us here but we want to know that when we get there brother Bram tells a story about that man that brother who said I want to fix it up here I don't want to get down to the river where I got to cross that River Jordan and die and go into that Promised Land into eternity and and maybe have trouble I want to fix it up now I want to know now a man that's filled with the Holy Ghost not thinks he's filled but he that's born of the the spirit of God does not commit sin for the seed of God is in him and he cannot sin see does the bible say that so there it is you are not what you do what is what not excuse me what the world thinks of you and I just want to say it's not even what we think of us we've got to be willing to actually look ourselves in the eye and say everything that I see with my eye is a lying vanity we know that that Jonah found himself in the belly of the whale right and what did he say brother bradam says it I never heard anybody else say it this way when he looked this way he saw whale belly and when he looked this way he saw whale belly and that way and that way and that way and that way all he saw was whale belly yes but he said I'm not looking at these that I see with my eyes these are lying vanities I am going to look towards the Temple of the most high God because he is God does the bible say that so there it is you're not what you do not what is what not what the world thinks of you it's what God thinks of you see amen you cannot how can I have an order written by the mayor of the city that I can run 40 m an hour through the city and any policeman arrests me I can't how can I sin when there's a blood offering before God constantly where he can't even see me when there's a bumper on on bumper before me on before me and God a shield of blood for we are dead and our life is hid in Christ through God sealed by the Holy Ghost how in the world can you do anything wrong in the sight of God that's why we can look at Romans chapter 7 and say my if I just keep looking at myself I'm going to say what a vile man I am oh my there's no way that I could ever overcome I could never live this message of the hour so I might as well just go and eat and drink and be merry because tomorrow I'm just going to die like everybody else all of those are just lying vanities though brothers and sisters flip the page go to Romans chapter 8 because the word of God says there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ who walk not after this flesh I don't look at this flesh I don't look at your flesh I look at the spirit I look at the word of God I want to see him manifest in my life amen if we're living there brothers and sisters I want to tell you today it is impossible for you to sin Hallelujah because what is sin what is sin it's unbelief how many unbelievers are there here today that don't believe this word of God not one hand right Hallelujah we believe this word of God so I want to say to you today you can't sin we're going to trip up and fall flat on our face we heard it last Sunday amen but that's what God wants am he doesn't want to see us hurt he doesn't want to see us down he wants to see us crying unto him saying lord I can't do this I need you to do this for me amen hallelujah we get to the place where we get over ourselves and stop the lying vanity in the mirror thinking that I'm good for anything this flesh is fit for Destruction only his spirit will make it brothers and sisters we know that he goes on to say if we sin willfully Hebrews chapter 10 after we receive the knowledge of the truth there is no more sacrifice for sin and here it's impossible see to sin willfully and you know if we get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters it is impossible for you to sin willfully because even though you're going to be tempted and you're going to be tried you're going to do this and you're going to fail at that you're going to have all these different things in your life that you're going to be able to look at and other people are going to be able to look at they're going to be able to point at you're going to know that these things have happened in your life that doesn't mean you don't believe the word of God does it amen right but to willfully say I don't believe all that brother bradam said I don't believe all about this Prophet I don't believe all about the cloud in 1963 I I don't believe all about the seals I I I don't believe I can't just believe that it's all about the Holy Ghost if we get to that place brothers and sisters what happens is we get our conscience our spiritual conscience burned over seared with a hot iron and you know what God says in the word that he'll give you over to a reprobate mind where you won't even be able to hear it anymore and we know that his Prophet said there's a a different description of that where if you re refuse refuse the the blast from the trumpet of Jubilee where you can be free completely free and and from the worst enemy of all yourself if you want if you receive that trumpet blast that Jubilee trumpet and and if you refuse it what happens is you're taken down to the temple not just your home but to the temple and you're pierced through in your ear with an all to identify that you are now a slave forever and brother bradam says that's not just in the Earl in the flesh it's in the eardrum of the spirit so you'll never be able to hear the word of God anymore and that's God giving you over to a reprobate mind not because he forced you to do it because you chose not to amen amen but I love how brother Ram talks about this paragraph 169 now it's starting to get real good here now he says now let's go ahead and read all right Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and Faith towards god of the doctrine of baptisms laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment and this we do if God permit now here's where they wanted to start from the fourth verse for it's impossible for those once enlightened and have tasted of the heaven gift who were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted of the good word of God and of the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame we don't ever want to go up to that place and turn around brothers and sisters you know let's just turn over to numbers chter 12 as I was studying this I just started to think about some of these things and amen the children of Israel were brought out from bondage they were brought out from the curse that was upon them 430 years they were in bondage God had sent them a deliverer they were out in the wilderness and the Believers my Bible says at the top here I don't know what you call the word in the middle at the top it says dissension dissension Numbers chapter 12 verse one and Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman who he had married for he had married an Ethiopian woman and they said hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses hath he not spoken also by us now you can tell by the way this is written that they weren't speaking to Moses they were having a private conversation weren't they but isn't it interesting here what the private conversation equates to the very next sentence is and the Lord heard it our private conversations are are private from other human beings but you know brothers and sisters I think many times it might be better for us to have a conversation that's private with other human beings and have other people's feelings get hurt because God's listening all the time amen and some of these private conversations brothers and sisters bring dissension and you know what dissension we're talking about is getting out of order from the word of God out of order from the way the prophet brought things in our day we we'll carry on here now the man Moses was very Meek above all the men which were on the face of the earth and the Lord spake suddenly unto Moses and unto Aaron can you imagine what that would be like suddenly unto Moses and unto Aaron and unto Miriam come out ye three unto the Tabernacle of the congregation and they three came out and the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the Tabernacle and called Aaron and Miriam and they both came forth and he said hear now my words my if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream my servant Moses is not so who is faithful in all mine house with him will I speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches and the similitude of the Lord shall be shall he behold wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses and the next next verse and the anger of the Lord was kindled against them and he departed I I just this just about floored me when I was thinking about this could you imagine knowing that the anger of the Lord was kindled against you and he departs from you you don't even get a chance to repent to say I'm sorry Lord but we know this is for a purpose he did not want to have them apologize to him he wanted them to actually go to his servant and apologize because he actually slandered they actually slandered his servant amen it's just like husbands and wives we can bring our sacrifice to the Lord and and and thank the Lord and and give praise to the Lord and apologize to the Lord for what I did to my wife and God's going to say hey you never did it to me I understand your heart but you did it to her you've got to go apologize to her so just leave your your sacrifice here of praise and worship and whatever else it is and just leave it here and go make it right with your wife and then come back and then I'll receive your worship yes sir but many times we just want to do it our way we don't want to do that harder work but the anger of the Lord was kindled against them and he departed and the cloud departed from off the Tabernacle and behold Miriam became leprous white as snow and Aaron looked upon Miriam and behold told she was leprous and you know what leprous means unbelief it's a type of unbelief brother brandham brings it very clearly in the message I'm not going to go too far into that but just to make it clear she was demonstrating absolute unbelief at that moment and her husband actually saw it the anger of the Lord was kindled against them and he departed my and Aaron said unto Moses alas my Lord I beseech thee not the sin Upon Us wherein we have done foolishly and wherein we have sinned let her not be as one dead of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb and Moses Cried unto the Lord saying heal her now oh Lord or oh God I beseech thee and the Lord said unto Moses if her father had but spit in her face should she not be ashamed seven days let her be shut out from the Camp seven days and after that let her be received in again and Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again I just can't help but think brothers and sisters we ought to be very careful with our discussions with our conversations in private because we think it's in private and we can just say whatever we want you can but God's listening he's hearing you and you know what we're going to actually create our future by the words that we speak we're living in the third pole generation brothers and sisters this is no time to play church this is no time to play around we're living in a time that that the whole entire world has waited for all of the sages and Prophets desired even angels desired to look upon the things that we just take for granted in the message of the hour all paragraph 170 out of questions and answers brother bradam he says now now that look like from the way that you're reading it there that a man could receive the Holy Ghost and then backslide and be lost but it's impossible for him to do it see he can't do it amen if he did Christ lied see it's impossible for those once enlightened period now watch here what's he speaking to he's speaking to those borderline Jews he never said a man being filled with the Holy Ghost he said if he has tasted the word of God right tasted the word of God paragraph 171 he says now let me just give it in a parabolic so that you'll see and won't miss it now now he's writing to these Jews some of them are borderline Believers see he said now we're going to leave these works and go on to talk about perfection said now we're talking about baptisms and resurrection of the dead and laying on of hands and everything but let's go already let's go ahead now to talk about perfection now we're going to talk about when you come into the Holy Ghost I love it how he just brings it right down now let's explain this now you've been hanging around the meeting a long time and you've seen those people they'll stay around they won't come in or go out they'll appreciate the Holy Ghost they'll come around and maybe the Holy Ghost do something and and Men they'll get up and jump and shout and and and and jump up and down the floor about it but they never want to receive it themselves no no see and they'll say oh yes that's good oh I don't know about that now see borderline believers just so close till they can taste it but yet they don't receive it see now they're hanging around like that so long till after a while they drift completely away and you know brothers and sisters I I guess I just felt led to preach this because we know that there's three kinds of Believers everywhere you go and it's important for us to know that we need to get into Christ Jesus amen don't be a borderline believer right don't be the one that says well I it works for me and I can just be this way because we know we're going to come to that place where we meet him face to face one day and we're going to say but Lord I and he's going to say no no no no no I I'm the one that did it but you chose to refuse the way that I provided in your day we know that in uh in the book of Exodus the children of Israel they had called and called and called for a deliverer when they were in Egypt and we know that God he finally called a deliverer one of their own we know the whole story very well he met him in the in the wilderness in in a burning bush and he came down and said to Moses in the wilderness I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into unto a good land and large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites all of the IES are going to be there it's not going to be just an empty vacant building or an empty vacant city it's going to be busy there there's going to be people there he didn't change his word one bit he told them that all of these people are going to be there these inhabitants of the land are going to be be there and and you need to go forwards and and you know I just think it's interesting to look at it maybe from a different perspective once the children of Israel did come out from bondage and as they did Journey Into the Wilderness now they're free two and a half million strong brother brandom said here they are and they come up to the Red Sea and and they find that they can't go across and they find that there's a mountain behind them and now brother Bram he says that they got their back up against the wall and oh my now they can see Pharaoh coming Pharaoh has changed his heart again and now he's coming after them and this time he's not going to come and try and take them back they know he's going to come and kill them now they're back is up against the wall oh no what are they going to do and we know that that Moses even started to tremble he started to get nervous and upset and cried out to God and God said have you not seen all of these signs and wonders all the way along what are you crying to me for speak the word and go forwards the point I want to get to brothers and sisters is we know the children of Israel they crossed the Red Sea they crossed the Red Sea on dry ground they weren't walking across those rocks at the bottom the sand at the bottom and slipping and sliding they weren't going on their Journey having an experience with the Lord in a slippery treacherous way he wasn't going to let them slip and slide and have all kinds of tripping and falling Maneuvers he gave them Solid Rock Solid dry ground to walk on and I just can't help but think that's the way of a True Believer to get into the Holy Ghost to get the Holy Ghost into our lives to go all the way into Christ he's going to give you a journey on a rock on a solid foundation you're not going to be slipping and sliding all over the place it's not going to be out of control in fact it's the other way around until you get there you're going to be slipping and sliding all over the place it's going to be all kinds of different problems and issues amen we know that when when the children of Israel just another one the same same Theory when the children of Israel they came out and and now they're with Joshua they've been in the wilderness a long long time we know the story too well when they were going to cross over Jordan what happened first the Levites the priests went forward with the Ark of the Covenant and what happened the Lord stopped the waters on the River Jordan and when they were crossing over Jordan did their feet get wet did they slip and slide were they uneasy and insecure did it seem like it was too much for them to bear like if they got started down that bank into the river that it would just they slip and fall no it was dry ground once again both instances the word of God says dry ground and we know that even especially with the Book of Joshua where they crossed over God said to them I want you to take some rocks out of that dry ground take some of those dry rocks and make make a statute make a a a a make a a a covenant make something that your children and your children's children will be able to look back on and see something that is of remembrance for them for this time that I provided the way for you to cross over to die out from yourselves and I just want to say brothers and sisters we don't have to live on the edge looking there seeing the the good fruits of the land we don't have to live in a situation where we look at our brothers and our sisters and say but look at the victory in their life my I just can't do it you can have the victory in fact I want to say you could probably have a victory that would encourage that person that already has the Victory and what happens is it just becomes Perpetual we encourage one another because we see the spirit of Christ Living out through our lives we see uh the Holy Spirit living in our midst our children see it that's probably the most important I can't help but think our children need to see not borderline believers not just so close till they can taste it brother bradam he says but they they don't receive it many times we can come and and taste it we can have good meetings we can go to special meetings we can go to special meetings wherever they are annual special meetings and they're tremendous we can go to camps and and and they're tremendous and why is that brothers and sisters I'll tell you why because we put behind us our regular lives and we actually focus on the moment we know why we travel to a camp it's not so that we can have a camp experience and say that I've had this great Victory and now I'm going to come back to real life and everything is going to be just as hard as it was before I left it's not so that we do the up and down thing it's so that we can push aside all of our regular lives and go and have an experience with God am remember the story that brother Wang told about the man who came in a prayer line I think he was 50 or 60 years old he came in a prayer line and said you know I just want to find the Holy Ghost I've been looking for the Holy Ghost when I was young I went to a camp and I had an experience there was like nothing else I've ever experienced in my life I wanted the Holy Ghost and I was praying for the Holy Ghost and the minister prayed for me and said go confessing and you'll have the Holy Ghost and he said I had something happened to me that night in that meeting and I went home to my people and I told them about my experience and what did they say oh was just a camp experience don't do anything with that just put it on the Shelf put it on the back burner don't don't get too excited now brothers and sisters if this can't get us excited what is it in this world that can get us excited the Holy Ghost living out through us is the greatest treasure that we'll ever find that's the pearl of great price amen we know this this man lived his life 40 years or so and actually came in a prayer line with brother Wayne and told him this story and he had to tell him you know brother you had it all along it's just the devil trying to tell you and you know how did the devil try and tell him this is the part I want to get to it was you brothers and sisters and you know I want to say it this way maybe even through a quack druggist brother Bram talks about them the ones who are ministers ministering the word of God the wrong way yes right there's fruit of the spirit amen there's definite markers and identifications of people filled with Holy Ghost don't get in the way of people who want to Rejoice amen amen don't be a borderline believer get into Christ brothers and sisters you'll never ever misbehave if you get the Holy Ghost in your life do you know that do we know that we'll never misbehave if we get the Holy Ghost in our life because he's never going to misbehave am he's a gentleman amen remember though the people that came out of that Upper Room building the word says the word says the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles says that they stumbled like drunk people am right we've watched some videos of people stumbling like drunk people and we've had to tell the children I wanted to tell them it's kind of what I grew up with with Pentecost it is the right anointing brother brandham says on the wrong vessels and how do you know whether it's the right vessel or the wrong vessel the right vessel will say amen God sent a prophet Malachi 4 has been fulfilled Revelations 10:7 is definitely true yes indeed they will say that that's the true evidence of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives everything else is false and and you know wasn't it so good what brother dawn said we have this conception that false is right over here and Truth is right over here but truth is actually right here right beside false one word off is Satan's kingdom amen so brother bradam he says it very clearly in this message that it is possible for people to come right up to the edge of the promised land right up to it and and to actually get right there and and to see the truth of the matter to see the fruits of the spirit to see the Holy Ghost but yet not go all the way we know that the people they tasted Those Grapes people tasted the figs and the pomegranates they tasted the honey and they tasted the milk but what did they say oh the sons of anakim are over there there's no way that we can go we're going to be like grasshoppers in their eyes you know we can see circumstances in our lives that seem insurmountable naturally brothers and sisters and that's exactly where God wants us he wants us to be in a situation where it seems impossible right because he's the god of the impossible he is the one that will come on the scene and blow our minds but the only way he's going to do that if we s if we simply say I believe amen but if we say I can't understand it nope I can't see how we can connect the dots I don't get it I don't know if we're doubting Thomas the only way I'll believe it is if I can see it you'll never see it it'll be right there in front of you and you will never be able to see it amen this is the God we're dealing with remember those disciples they walked with him they sat in his meetings they listened to him even after the resurrection and while they walked down the road complaining we thought this was the one this was the Messiah oh we're going to be delivered and what did he do he drew near to them as they were walking and he said what's your problem what are you talking about why are you so down and they said are you a stranger in this land don't you know what's going on this man we thought Jesus the great prophet oh he's raised the Dead He's healed the sick he's preached Mighty campaigns he's done all these wonderful things but now he's dead we thought he was the one and he said fools slow of heart not to not believe the prophets but fool slow of heart to believe what the prophets have said but you don't see what's going on right now he was the one that was right beside them speaking to them but yet they didn't know it if we have the ability to see it brothers and sisters we got every single reason to Rejoice we got every single reason to shout we got every single reason to get out of what we would consider to be order in this world in which we live in you know we're going to get over there brother bradam said it it's going to be the loudest Place we've ever been don't worry about getting out of order here the Holy Ghost will never let you get out of order this might sound like some are completely lost you know for it's a impossible for those who were once enlightened amen but brother Bram says it very clearly in this message you can never ever be enlightened truly enlightened the only way that you'll ever be enlightened is by having the holy ghost in your life but many people some people maybe just a few I hope that just maybe barely none around here anyways will just come to church and will just say I have it my way and that's as good as it's ever going to get don't try and preach to me anything because I'm only ever going to do it this way it's the way I've resolved we've got to be willing to be fluid we've got to be willing to be flexible remember what we said last week that saying I heard if we're not willing to be flexible then we're going to get bent out of shape am this word of God wasn't sent to make us comfortable I remember early on as as in this office here saying oh my I just don't want to upset people and a brother basically shook me and said the word of God is not sent to make us feel comfortable the word of God is sent to shake us up amen it's sent to set us straight yes but it might sound like some are completely lost because we've seen some people who have actually come right up to the edge right to the very edge and then step back I want to say brothers and sisters don't ever give up hope don't ever give up hope it's not up to us to determine who is the wheat and who is the weed right and that's the Deeds of the nians when they start getting mixed up trying to determine who is who it's not right don't do it but we all have loved ones I know that and some the truth of the matter is some might not be very elected and that's God's choice that's not ours right that's why we have to preach get the Holy Ghost amen because if you're very elected you'll get the Holy Ghost you will but some just won't be able to go all the way but it's not up to us to determine what it is up to us to do is to live this message amen preaching it is one thing but brothers and sisters let's live it let's not let one corrupt communication come out of our mouth like the word of God says that's what the word says right we agree on that not to let any corrupt communication come forth out of our mouths doesn't matter whether it's doesn't say there's an exclusion there's a what note we just need to go and look this up and say well unless you're alone unless you're in a car unless there's nobody else around it's okay you can have the conversation no let no corrupt communication come forwards how do the children of Israel wind up laying their carcasses down in the wilderness because they started to murmur against God but they weren't saying oh this God he's a terrible God I can't stand this God what they did was they murmured about the man God chose to put before them amen and it was murmuring where he said you know what enough I'm done their carcasses you know unless you're 21 or younger all of your carcasses are going to fall in the wilderness you're going to wander until you die and that's that you will not inherit This Promise Land some of our loved ones they may not be very elected and it's not up to us to determine that but it's up to us to live this message to its fullest brothers and sisters amen talk is cheap but our words will never be able to live up to the speed in which we live it's up to us to speak according to this word it's up to us to live according to this word it's up to us to encourage as many as we can according to this word amen and you know when we see someone that's discouraged what's the best way to help someone who's discouraged the best way to overcome discouragement is with encouragement amen you know I I saw a thing and I thought it was so good many people might be aware of it and if if you're interested I could probably find it and and send it to you with Brother Eugene Brown and Edmonton Living Word he he used to be a horse trainer and I think he still is to some respect but he talks about how the round pen training happens we might have talked about this in the past but I just saw a clip this week and I thought it was so good there was a horse that just had his first saddle put on it and it was running around and it was trying to Buck the saddle off and it didn't know what to do it was confused and there was a guy in the middle of the Ring he had a microphone and he was talking about how this horse is is just it's just dealing with life as it is it doesn't know how to deal with this new thing happening in its life and so it's running around and it's uncomfortable and it's scared and and the thing is the horse just needs to come to the place of of of Peace on its own and when it does it's going to actually stop and it's going to come right beside the trainer in the middle it's going to recognize that's the safest place for it is right beside the trainer in the middle and the man who is speaking he says that's what we need to do sometimes we need to recognize the safest place for us is right beside the father not trying to run around and trying to figure out because we're scared and we don't understand the circumstance and situation and try and find a place of comfort you know that's what we do sometimes but you know what also this man said said he said I'm not doing anything right now and he kept passing the Rope around he stayed in the same position and just kept passing the Rope around as the horse would run and then the horse changed directions and he would just keep passing it around he said the worst thing that I could do right now is point out all of this horse's problems point out all this horse is doing wrong I'm just going to let this horse work it out because this horse will eventually calm down this horse will eventually find peace and the horse did came right around and put her head right here against him and just calmed right down and you know brothers and sisters I just can't help but think that's the way it is for us as Believers we've got to stop running around and trying to make it work even though we get nervous we all get upset we all have tur turmoils and troubles in our lives but we got to remember the safest place is right beside the Father the best place to deal with discouragement is encouragement don't try and point out faults and failures I'm trying to encourage you amen look at the way you're doing that I'm just trying to encourage you honey are you that's not encouraging if we're going to point out faults and failures encouragement is to Simply do the opposite that's what brother brandham said amen just simply do the opposite you know I can't stand the way that my wife does that every single time every single day she does that over and over and over and I tell her and she just doesn't ever change her ways but what if I was to just simply say you know honey I love it when you actually do this I love it when you actually do it the way that I've been talking about or our children I just love it when you actually behave I love it when you just go and put your coat away I love it when you actually put your shoes where they belong I love it when you just get out of bed in the morning I love it when you just do what you're supposed to do if we would just simply begin doing that brothers and sisters with our brothers and our sisters we would see a different world in which we live in but the devil wants us to just be needling on the problem s and what's happening is our discouragement is bringing more discouragement and as we're discouraged we never get encouraged we know there's a spirit behind that if we don't recognize it we need to recognize it that's a spirit it gets in our marriage it gets in our church it gets in our families gets in our friendships it can get in our workplace it's all over schools but you know that's the same thing that Bayo taught balum to do was just look at the hinder parts right and cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel recognize that they're human beings recognize that they've got faults and failures they've got weaknesses and as soon as that happened we know brother bradam talks about it it's in the word Kadesh Baria was not a good place for the children of Israel Kadesh barnea is the place where it was decision time where it was changing the direction of everything time and we know brother brandham in this message questions and answers on the Holy Ghost if you don't know he says in there the Tabernacle is at KES Baria today where they're going to make a decision on whether they're going to actually follow the word of God it's so beautiful because he doesn't say it's the denominations out there he says this Tabernacle is at Kadesh barnea decision time where we come to a Crossroads where we need to decide what we're going to do we know the spirit of God won't always strive with man and we all will come to that day where we will reach a crossroad and I just pray brothers and sisters that every single one of us would reach that Crossroad and take the right turn Hallelujah brother Bram says we're no longer building a wall we're turning a corner we're building a house a three-dimensional building don't be busy casting a stumbling block in front of people in front of our our families in front of our brothers and sisters in front of our children he says let's I I just want to say this not he I want to say this let's recognize that this is the devil brothers and sisters he just wants to discourage us that's all right God wants to encourage us the devil wants to discourage us when we see discouragement coming our way that's not from God and you know I I just think it's so beautiful it took me right back to the Ephesian Church age remember when we read that just recently I don't know if it was last Wednesday or the Wednesday before in the Ephesian Church age the exposition of seven Church ages God knows exactly what to discourage us Us in and exactly what to encourage Us in amen he knows exactly what we need and when we need it he knows how much pressure we need but God doesn't come and apply sickness in our lives remember he says who can get my word to come to pass in brother Barry's life who can get my word to come to pass in my son or my daughter's life who who who can do that for me God doesn't throw sickness on us it's the devil that does it but God always has his will his way he knows how to encourage us and discourage Us in the things that we need we need to remember brothers and sisters that our words have power we're we're living in an age that's different than any other age we had talked about it with the exposition of the seven Church ages and how we're we're just talking about the Ephesian Church Age and and it can seem like that church age is just for that church age and truly indeed it was but all of that carries forward to the next Church age we read that last Wednesday and all of those first two Church ages carry forward to the Third Church age and all of those first three Church ages carry forward to the fourth to the fifth to the sixth and here we are in the seventh we've got all of that pressure from all of those Church ages now in the day in which we live in that's why outside of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives there's no way that we're ever going to be able to stand there's no way that this message will ever do us any good brothers and sisters outside of Christ the holy ghost coming to live inside of us but you know if you have once been enlightened with this word if you have tasted of the Heavenly gift and you have gone forward all the way to be sealed with the Holy Ghost then you will never ever be able to fall and brother bradam says that it is impossible for someone who has once been enlightened it is absolutely impossible for you to fall if you get yourself all the way into Christ and Christ all the way into you we don't have to have that worry like the scripture says maybe oh my one day I could fall you can never fall amen we said it last week believe brother bradam even tells a story about that that preacher that decided he was given up on it he was done with it and he was going to go and get a case of beer he sent his his assistant or young brother or someone in the church to go and get him a box of beer and the boy said I'm not doing it but the man went and did it anyways and what happened God took him home right because he won't allow any of his to be lost we might choose to take a different direction but that's going to be the time God steps in and says okay that's time to take you home because you will not be lost I will not lose one right today brothers and sisters my prayer is that we just don't get leprosy I'm going to end the the discussion on the questions and answers of the Holy Ghost it is not possible for those who are once enlightened who have tasted of this heavenly gift and the word of God it's not possible for you to ever fall away you will never ever be able to be lost if you have Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the Holy Ghost ghost living in your life you will never be able to be lost and I pray that today we don't get leprosy leprosy is a type of unbelief and you know I I just when I was thinking about this this idea of leprosy and how that's what was portrayed why did he use that in the Bible why did Miriam get leprosy because it's super contagious super contagious if something wasn't done about her she would have spread that leprosy throughout the whole congregation throughout the whole Camp right right and God said just let her be separated now even if her father spit in her face just let her be separated for seven days let her spend her time let her think about her actions but then when she has done her time then she can come back in leprosy is very contagious brothers and sisters that's why it is a type of unbelief it's a very contagious thing spirit travel on words when we're going to talk don't let any corrupt communication come out of your mouth but something that's edifying Let It Be edifying to the body to the people to the situations because you know the devil is roaming about as a roaring lion seeing whom he will devour and and it's sad but true our children are definitely vulnerable in our homes to get leprosy spiritual leprosy if we're not careful they'll hear the conversation and it'll go right into their heart and they'll think that's what Mom and Dad is treating the situation as and you know what happens is Mom and Dad will be held accountable for the children other family members can catch it other church members can catch it I just can't help but think I I like that shut your mouth Ministry we heard brother Cadre talk about it and I heard a brother in our congregation back when I was early on in this message of the hour he told me to shut up I don't want to hear another word about that brother he's my brother shut your mouth don't tell me another word and as long as we're willing to say oh yeah oh yeah that brother I know he's like that you know it's just spirit's going back and forth spirit's going back and forth spirit's going back and forth if we've got a desire in our heart to go and talk bad about a brother and a sister I want to say this do we even really have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters because the word of God says that if we have ought against a brother or a brother has ought against us what are we supposed to do we supposed to go to that brother or that sister not to someone else and talk about them if that's what we're doing it's wrong now I'm not saying that you can't have the Holy Ghost and go and do that but I am saying that when you do that you'll want to go and make it right you'll want to go and make it right yes other church members other churches they can get it they're only going to be listening to what you say really they're going to think wow that church is going through that and and and and I know that you're a Believer and and to hear that that's what's going on that's terrible simply passing on leprosy the only inoculation for it brothers and sisters is the Holy Ghost the person of Jesus Christ you know if we if we if we are truly living in that seventh age if we are truly living in that place where it's the culmination of all the other ages in the spoken word condition brothers and sisters oughtn't we to be living well beyond the ABCs understanding the great spiritual things not needing to be taught and and I I don't think that we need to don't get me wrong I I just I can only bring what the Lord puts on my heart and and Lord willing will move on and let me assure you that I feel like this has gone on a long time talking about the Holy Ghost and I just think it's a wonderful topic it doesn't get any better but sometimes it can feel like it gets stagnant and I don't mean it to be that way I'll call the musicians now we have a service tonight I'm going to read a quote out of the exposition of the seven Church ages uh out of the sardan church age brother branam says this make no mistake about it I just love how cut and dried it is make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way yes and I think that's just such a beautiful thing because you know I don't want to say that they'll be in the word all the way saying oh I believe that God sent a prophet yeah I'm in the word all the way they're going to be living the word all the way it's going to be apparent in their lives maybe stand with me as we close we're not going to be just saying that I'm in the word all the way we're going to be living it amen he says that's the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas failed multitudes fail right there and when they fail to go on in that word their names are taken off the Book of Life brothers and sisters it's just it's just nothing to play with this this is nothing to just act as though it's it's not going to affect me it's going to affect way more than maybe we think or maybe than we feel it's very important for us to get the Holy Ghost that's the only thing get into Christ brothers and sisters don't just go right up to the edge of it I I I feel like I didn't even really do this justice but I just trust that if you have the desire for Christ in your life if there is a cry for more Christ in your life it's because there's more Christ for you to have in your life and and he is more than willing to actually give that I uh failed to mention our visitors we have brother Anthony and sister gift and their baby L Nathan visiting from Nigeria God bless you am we have brother Isaac from ont IO and his sister Sarah from Nigeria God richly bless you as well I trust you feel right at home here brothers and sisters don't just go right up to the edge brother bradam he says in paragraph 198 now of questions and answers now them borderline Believers back there they was right with them they were circumcised with their circumcision they went right over to the land that God promised right to the edge of it and many a man walks up to that edge he'll walk right up to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and reject it he doesn't say just resist it or just step aside from it he says reject it he'll walk right up to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and reject it he don't want to give it up he'll walk right up to the scripture baptism in the name of Jesus Christ turn his back back and rejecting it to keep from seeing it my I just want to encourage everyone to get into Christ that's all I can say brothers and sisters remember the communion service tonight at 5:30 God bless you let's just bow Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you for your word thank you for sending us a profit in the day in which we live thank you for tying up all the Loose Ends through your Prophet

mount and we know that it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and Lord we know some people are able to recognize you and others aren't and father if we're able to we're so thankful father we just pray that more people would be able to Lord while your spirit terries father we just ask that we would be able to bring as many with us as we can Lord Jesus that our lives would live

separate ways bless our communion service tonight Lord as we partake of your body as we remember you father and what you did for us as we follow your instruction you said to to do this in remembrance
