[56:38] bless you this morning welcome to the
[56:40] house of the
[56:41] Lord certainly an honor and a privilege
[56:44] to be here
[56:45] today knowing that we've all been called
[56:48] to be
[56:49] here didn't just stumble into this place
[56:52] right we didn't just come here
[56:56] haphazardly we came here expecting to
[56:59] hear from God and this morning brothers
[57:02] and sisters if we've come for any other
[57:04] reason I just hope that we would be able
[57:06] to change our perspective and just see
[57:09] that the Lord wants to speak to us we
[57:12] just have some requests this morning
[57:14] that we wanted to bring before the
[57:16] church and we know that many times we
[57:19] don't understand the way things are and
[57:23] and the way God allows things to happen
[57:26] but we know that it's for his glory
[57:28] because all things work together for the
[57:32] good to those who are called according
[57:35] to his purpose they don't all just work
[57:38] together for the good this world is not
[57:41] set up that
[57:42] way but those who are called that's a
[57:45] different
[57:46] story sister Mar olarte has a a request
[57:50] that she would like to bring in the form
[57:52] of a praise report this morning and I
[57:54] just so appre appreciate that so many
[57:57] times we come to the Lord and we have
[57:59] needs and we know that we've been taught
[58:01] the only way we're going to get what we
[58:03] want us to cry out for it but I believe
[58:05] that he likes to hear a little
[58:07] appreciation once in a while

[1:05:11] morning but I just felt led to go this
[1:05:14] way so we know enough to follow the
[1:05:16] leadership of the Lord if you turn with
[1:05:17] me to Malachi chapter
[1:05:23] 3
[1:05:33] Malachi chapter
[1:05:38] 3 verse
[1:05:44] 16 we know the Book of Malachi is the
[1:05:48] call it the bridge between the Old
[1:05:50] Testament and the New Testament and we
[1:05:52] know that Malachi was a prophet and
[1:05:54] Malachi brother Malachi had thus sayeth
[1:05:57] the Lord isn't that
[1:06:00] wonderful verse 16 of Malachi chter 3
[1:06:04] then they that feared the Lord spake
[1:06:07] often one to another and the Lord
[1:06:12] hearkened and heard it
[1:06:16] amen and a book of remembrance was
[1:06:19] written before him for them that feared
[1:06:23] the Lord
[1:06:29] and that thought upon his
[1:06:39] name it just gets me emotional reading
[1:06:41] this because I know I know it's about us
[1:06:47] yes and they shall be mine saith the
[1:06:50] Lord of hosts in that day when I make up
[1:06:52] my jewels and I will spare them as a man
[1:06:56] spareth his own son that serveth
[1:07:04] him
[1:07:06] Hallelujah then shall you return and
[1:07:10] discern between the righteous and the
[1:07:12] wicked between him that serveth God and
[1:07:18] him that serveth him

[1:07:50] you up in our midst Lord and father that

[1:10:26] brother TR you
[1:10:27] [Applause]
[1:10:37] right I'm sorry I can't I just can't get
[1:10:40] in his presence and not get emotional
[1:10:41] it's just the way it is I remember
[1:10:43] hearing uh brother um I don't know if I
[1:10:47] mentioned it before greetings from
[1:10:48] Brother Paul halet and the assembly in
[1:10:51] Idaho as well as uh
[1:10:55] oh my now I'm drawing a blank I don't
[1:10:56] know why I
[1:10:59] am the minister from his
[1:11:02] assembly yes brother Dean Hart I spoke
[1:11:06] to him at length a little while ago and
[1:11:10] uh we have lined up our Easter meetings
[1:11:12] for this year I believe that he's going
[1:11:14] to come and Minister them but I remember
[1:11:16] him being here and uh he's the one
[1:11:19] brother that just said it like it is I
[1:11:21] can't I can't get up here and not get
[1:11:23] snotty it's just the way it works just
[1:11:25] the way God made me and uh you get in
[1:11:28] his presence and it's just about
[1:11:29] impossible to not get
[1:11:32] emotional Brother David Dean har is a
[1:11:35] fantastic brother he's been here many
[1:11:37] times uh more times than I recall
[1:11:39] actually he informed me but he uh he
[1:11:43] said he felt good about it and we just
[1:11:45] pray about it so uh pray about the
[1:11:48] meetings for Easter and just trust the
[1:11:50] Lord that Brother David will come
[1:11:54] this uh scripture this morning I just
[1:11:55] felt compelled to read out of Malachi
[1:11:58] chapter
[1:11:59] 3 I I just think it's wonderful than
[1:12:02] they that feared the Lord spake often
[1:12:04] one to another I believe that's what the
[1:12:06] Fellowship of the Believers is that's
[1:12:08] that's who we are that's that's what we
[1:12:10] do we can get together and talk about
[1:12:12] sports and we can talk about Phantom
[1:12:15] football and we can talk about all of
[1:12:17] the hockey and we can talk about all the
[1:12:19] things in the world the politics and and
[1:12:22] and everything that's going on in the
[1:12:23] world but you know when we start to talk
[1:12:26] about the things of the Lord that's when
[1:12:28] our fellowship really begins when we
[1:12:30] start to speak about the Lord and isn't
[1:12:32] it wonderful to know that the Lord
[1:12:35] hearkened they that feared the Lord
[1:12:37] spake often one to another and the Lord
[1:12:40] hearkened it doesn't say that it's a
[1:12:43] specific time and a specific day some
[1:12:45] other age some other place it just just
[1:12:48] as they that spake about the Lord often
[1:12:51] he wrote a book about them and and kept
[1:12:54] a remembrance of them and and you know
[1:12:57] those that that feared the Lord their
[1:12:59] names A Remembrance was written before
[1:13:02] him for them that feared the Lord and
[1:13:05] that thought upon his name I just it
[1:13:08] just about put me over thinking about
[1:13:11] this that even if we just think about
[1:13:13] the Lord we're getting put in a book of
[1:13:16] remembrance we have the desire to think
[1:13:18] about the Lord there's if you have that
[1:13:20] desire brothers and sisters there's
[1:13:22] something special about
[1:13:24] let's not discount that if you've got
[1:13:26] the desire to come to church if you've
[1:13:27] got the desire to press play and listen
[1:13:29] to the message if you've got the desire
[1:13:31] to go on your knees or to pick up your
[1:13:32] Bible there's something inside of you
[1:13:35] that you never put there there's
[1:13:37] something inside of you that your
[1:13:38] parents never put there there's
[1:13:40] something inside of you that God put
[1:13:42] there from before the foundation of the
[1:13:44] world that you would be
[1:13:46] predestinated in his for knowledge to
[1:13:49] have the desire to listen to the word of
[1:13:51] God to have the desire to feed upon the
[1:13:54] word to talk about the
[1:13:56] word you know last time I ministered we
[1:14:00] talked about Galatians chapter 3 and
[1:14:02] about how there's a seed and it's not
[1:14:05] seeds it's not multiple seeds and the
[1:14:09] world wants to water it down and make it
[1:14:12] as though there's multiple seeds there's
[1:14:15] many different ways it's like a a GPS
[1:14:17] you could go anywhere in the world and
[1:14:20] you could just type in heaven and you
[1:14:22] want to find the way to get get there
[1:14:23] and you can take many different Avenues
[1:14:25] and and many different highways and many
[1:14:28] different byways and you can still get
[1:14:30] to heaven if you just follow the the way
[1:14:32] that's provided for you but you know
[1:14:34] that's not the way God intended for us I
[1:14:36] apologize this is driving me a little
[1:14:38] bit Bonkers this morning but we know
[1:14:41] it's the devil you know there's not many
[1:14:43] ways to get to heaven there's only one
[1:14:44] way that we're going to make it to
[1:14:46] Heaven there's only one way one truth
[1:14:48] and one life and that's to follow the
[1:14:50] word of God for our day that's to follow
[1:14:53] the word of God for your day for any day
[1:14:55] for any age they had an opportunity to
[1:14:58] actually come and follow the
[1:15:01] word but the only way you can do that is
[1:15:03] if you're a
[1:15:04] seed Not seeds in Galatians chapter 3 we
[1:15:08] read this verse 16 now to Abraham and
[1:15:10] his seed were the promises made he saith
[1:15:14] not and to seeds as of many but as of
[1:15:18] one and to thy seed which is Christ now
[1:15:22] many times we can put that off I believe
[1:15:25] and say well that was Christ there were
[1:15:27] speaking about that seed that righteous
[1:15:29] seed that would come that would be
[1:15:30] conceived in a virgin and and and we
[1:15:33] know that brother bradam talked about it
[1:15:34] how it was neither a man and neither a
[1:15:36] woman it was God it wasn't the the the
[1:15:41] the germ and the Egg coming together of
[1:15:43] of human beings it was all God we know
[1:15:46] that's what brother Bram said but then
[1:15:48] we could maybe look at it and say well
[1:15:50] it's to Christ at the end of that verse
[1:15:51] it says and to thy seed which is is
[1:15:53] Christ but I want to say if you have
[1:15:55] Christ in you who are
[1:15:57] you whose seed are you you're not your
[1:16:01] own seed we're not just Mom and Dad's
[1:16:04] seed that came together and and and
[1:16:05] suddenly now we have the ability to
[1:16:07] believe this word we were in Christ
[1:16:10] before the foundation of the world it's
[1:16:11] a genetic code that can never be broken
[1:16:14] brothers and sisters and today where I
[1:16:16] want to go I just felt led to go here is
[1:16:18] adoption talking about adoption and
[1:16:21] understanding what it means and trying
[1:16:22] to encourage just to recognize there's a
[1:16:24] few key points in there that really I
[1:16:27] think could help us along our way amen
[1:16:31] hallelujah they they that feared the
[1:16:34] Lord spake often one to
[1:16:37] another and the Lord hearkened and heard
[1:16:40] it I just want to mention that word
[1:16:43] feared here it's not feared with afraid
[1:16:48] I I was I was afraid that God was going
[1:16:50] to come and find me one day so I ran and
[1:16:52] hid I I was afraid so I I I ran and and
[1:16:56] and did everything I could in my life to
[1:16:58] go as far as I could to the ends of the
[1:17:00] Earth to get away from God I I was
[1:17:02] afraid so I tried to do something to get
[1:17:04] away from him no not at all this wasn't
[1:17:08] the fear that Adam had in the Garden of
[1:17:10] Eden when God came around and said Adam
[1:17:14] Where Art Thou God knew exactly where
[1:17:16] Adam was but Adam he knew where he was
[1:17:20] but he had a desire to hide himself from
[1:17:22] the face of God when he came around this
[1:17:25] isn't the fear that we're talking about
[1:17:26] this is reverence this is the people
[1:17:29] that are willing to say Amen to the word
[1:17:32] the people that are willing to subject
[1:17:34] themselves to the word for their day and
[1:17:36] say maybe I don't understand it maybe
[1:17:38] personally I don't know according to the
[1:17:40] traditions and and maybe my my family I
[1:17:43] just can't really get past it but you
[1:17:45] know what I'm willing to do is just
[1:17:47] trust the Lord that he'll reveal it to
[1:17:49] me in my time in his time you know
[1:17:52] there's only only one form of life in
[1:17:54] this world in this universe there's only
[1:17:57] one form of life I've often thought
[1:18:00] before I got saved that there was many
[1:18:01] forms of life and sure we can look at
[1:18:03] the the the world and and and the
[1:18:06] scientific theories that there would be
[1:18:08] of all of the different forms of life
[1:18:10] from you know the the lowest of of life
[1:18:13] form a mitochondria or something that
[1:18:15] would be microscopic all the way up to a
[1:18:18] human being we could say there's all
[1:18:19] these different life forms and sure
[1:18:21] enough there is living on the planet
[1:18:23] Earth but you know in this universe
[1:18:25] there's only one form of life and that's
[1:18:27] God's own life that's Zoey that's
[1:18:29] eternal life there's only one form of
[1:18:32] life and all life comes from
[1:18:36] God man would like to think that he
[1:18:38] creates life but all life comes from
[1:18:42] God there's only one seed brothers and
[1:18:45] sisters that can live eternally and that
[1:18:47] seed is God we could say God's seed but
[1:18:53] if it's God's seed then it's a piece of
[1:18:55] God it's a part of God it's not some
[1:18:58] other seed it's not some other thing
[1:19:00] that's just changed into a a a a a new
[1:19:04] seed and and that's kind of I guess the
[1:19:06] direction that I feel led to go today
[1:19:08] brothers and sisters even though we
[1:19:10] become a new creature in Christ Jesus in
[1:19:12] our bodies we actually don't become a a
[1:19:16] new Christ we are the same Christ that
[1:19:19] was yesterday today and forever now it's
[1:19:22] almost getting
[1:19:24] heretical sound like a heretic talking
[1:19:27] like this but brothers and sisters if
[1:19:28] you got the Holy Ghost in you who are
[1:19:30] you we'll keep saying that you're not
[1:19:33] going to be you plus God it's not going
[1:19:35] to be God plus you when the true baptism
[1:19:39] of the Holy Spirit hits a person when
[1:19:41] the whole Holy Spirit takes over a
[1:19:43] person you become a new creature in
[1:19:45] Christ Jesus you actually become Christ
[1:19:48] manifest to the world
[1:19:51] Amen and it becomes it becomes a little
[1:19:54] bit out there I know it can be very
[1:19:55] difficult to actually really
[1:19:58] grasp but aren't you glad the chapter 4
[1:20:02] of Malachi said behold I will send you
[1:20:05] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:20:08] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:20:11] when is The Great and Dreadful day of
[1:20:13] the Lord whenever that
[1:20:17] is God promised through Malachi his
[1:20:20] Prophet that he's going to send a
[1:20:22] prophet true yes amen he promised that
[1:20:25] he would send a prophet with thus sayith
[1:20:27] the
[1:20:28] Lord and and I just think it's beautiful
[1:20:30] because he says it in in in in personal
[1:20:34] tense if that's the right way to say
[1:20:36] that I don't even know but he says
[1:20:38] behold I yes won't send them behold I
[1:20:45] will send you Elijah the
[1:20:48] prophet and some people can say Amen to
[1:20:51] that and other people maybe scratch
[1:20:53] their head and think wow how who's you
[1:20:56] and who's I I I don't know all these
[1:20:59] these pronouns but I believe it just
[1:21:02] becomes personal when we can get the
[1:21:04] baptism of the Holy Spirit it becomes a
[1:21:06] new book to us amen and that's really
[1:21:08] what it's all about we say it every
[1:21:10] single time you know the only way we're
[1:21:11] going to get the holy spirit is to
[1:21:13] repent get baptized in the name of the
[1:21:15] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:21:17] our sins and then we shall receive the
[1:21:19] gift of the Holy Ghost that is the
[1:21:20] promise and and that's what's going to
[1:21:22] get us into the Rapture that's what's
[1:21:24] going to get us out of the graveyard
[1:21:26] should we go by the way of the Grave we
[1:21:29] know brother Ram tells this story about
[1:21:31] the life insurance salesman saying would
[1:21:34] you like to get some life insurance do
[1:21:36] you have any life insurance brother
[1:21:38] brandom says yeah I I've got I've got
[1:21:40] Assurance I have assurance and it takes
[1:21:43] a little bit for them to get past that
[1:21:45] but he says you know life insurance will
[1:21:47] actually get me in the grave it will put
[1:21:50] me in the graveyard but life assurance
[1:21:53] will get me out and that's what we're
[1:21:55] talking about today brothers and sisters
[1:21:56] is not just getting a financial payout
[1:21:58] even though that's good for our families
[1:22:00] here on Earth should the Lord decide to
[1:22:02] take us home but we want that Blessed
[1:22:04] assurance that Jesus is
[1:22:06] mine and once we get that it's a
[1:22:09] foretaste of Glory
[1:22:12] Divine talking about
[1:22:15] adoption sometimes I believe it can
[1:22:18] sound like it's it's going to happen
[1:22:21] someday doesn't it adoption it's a
[1:22:25] process it's a an event and we know
[1:22:27] brother Bram talks about how a son or a
[1:22:29] daughter uh takes the biblical type of
[1:22:32] the son who comes to a full maturity
[1:22:35] he's been under the T tutorship of a a
[1:22:37] teacher and and gets very well
[1:22:40] instructed and comes to the place where
[1:22:42] the tutor can can go back to the father
[1:22:44] with the report and say you know answer
[1:22:47] all the questions the father might have
[1:22:48] and and and we know that the tutor can
[1:22:50] say yep to every single question that
[1:22:53] gets asked he can say yes indeed he's
[1:22:55] followed all of the instructions and now
[1:22:57] it's time to take him and actually adopt
[1:23:00] him it's not like we're just taking
[1:23:01] someone who is an orphan in the world
[1:23:03] who whose parents we don't even really
[1:23:05] know where they came from or what their
[1:23:07] background is and just making them our
[1:23:09] child no this is a child that was that
[1:23:11] child before the foundation of the world
[1:23:13] this is a child that's been very
[1:23:15] carefully looked after and watched over
[1:23:18] over the years and it's been under
[1:23:20] careful leadership and training and now
[1:23:22] now that child is coming to full
[1:23:24] maturity and what happens when you
[1:23:26] became adopted in the Biblical times in
[1:23:28] that culture it meant that your word was
[1:23:31] the same as the father's word the father
[1:23:33] no longer had to speak basically he just
[1:23:35] handed over the business to the child
[1:23:37] and and the child the son was now in
[1:23:39] complete control and you know that's
[1:23:41] interesting that that Elijah that we
[1:23:43] spoke about behold I will send you
[1:23:44] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:23:46] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:23:48] he would preach a series called adoption
[1:23:50] brothers and sisters this adoption
[1:23:52] series isn't just about something that's
[1:23:54] going to happen somewhere out there I I
[1:23:56] was thinking about it and you know
[1:23:57] sometimes it can sound like it's going
[1:23:59] to happen someday but for those people
[1:24:01] that don't know what about today what
[1:24:04] about right now brothers and sisters
[1:24:06] what about full adoption for the Sons
[1:24:08] and Daughters of God because if we come
[1:24:10] to that place Satan ain't going to have
[1:24:13] anywhere to go he's not going to have
[1:24:15] one foothold in our lives and I
[1:24:18] personally think that's that's a great
[1:24:19] place to be isn't it isn't that going to
[1:24:21] be somewhere want to be fully adopted
[1:24:24] Sons and Daughters of God not having to
[1:24:26] worry about Satan not having to worry
[1:24:28] about all of his Antics and his tactics
[1:24:30] and and the problems that come around
[1:24:33] you know there's so many diseases in
[1:24:35] this world that that that he uses to
[1:24:37] come against us to come against us as
[1:24:40] human
[1:24:40] beings but we've been given power we've
[1:24:43] been given authority over every single
[1:24:46] one of those diseases and he wants us to
[1:24:48] believe that was only for Elijah the
[1:24:50] prophet that came and went now he's gone
[1:24:53] so nobody has the power to stand up to
[1:24:55] Satan I want to say to you brothers and
[1:24:57] sisters you have all the power of Heaven
[1:24:59] standing behind you in your prayers you
[1:25:02] don't have to have a great evangelist
[1:25:04] you don't have to go and make a
[1:25:05] pilgrimage somewhere to find a Ministry
[1:25:07] to pray for
[1:25:09] you you can
[1:25:11] pray and you know brothers and sisters I
[1:25:14] want to encourage each one of us to come
[1:25:15] to the place to recognize that it should
[1:25:18] be us able to pray that way because if
[1:25:21] we can't pray that way then we're not
[1:25:23] fully adopted Sons and Daughters of God
[1:25:26] but if we can come to the place where we
[1:25:28] say Daddy I know I can't do anything on
[1:25:30] my own it's completely up to you and I
[1:25:31] just want to take your word and remind
[1:25:33] you of your word you said that by those
[1:25:35] 39 Stripes I am
[1:25:38] healed that's what you said am so I want
[1:25:42] to remind you of that Amen brother
[1:25:45] random talks about adoption in the
[1:25:47] messages adoption I'm going to jump
[1:25:50] around through the messages of adoption
[1:25:53] this morning and I hope it's okay but
[1:25:57] brother random says it in the book of uh
[1:26:00] in in in the messages adoption sorry um
[1:26:03] that Ephesians the book of Ephesians
[1:26:05] perfectly parallels the Book of Joshua
[1:26:07] and we we talked about this at length a
[1:26:10] while ago and maybe a few years ago now
[1:26:12] but I I just felt led to go this way so
[1:26:15] here we are today talking about the book
[1:26:17] of Ephesians perfectly paralleling the
[1:26:21] Book of Joshua
[1:26:22] and you know when when you hear
[1:26:24] something like that it just for me it
[1:26:27] really draws my attention it makes me
[1:26:28] think well what on Earth does the book
[1:26:31] of Ephesians say and you know what does
[1:26:33] the Book of Joshua say so like I said
[1:26:36] years ago we we we studied this maybe
[1:26:38] not that long ago a couple years but uh
[1:26:41] the Book of Joshua maybe turn over there
[1:26:43] with me the the first chapter of Joshua
[1:26:45] I think it it's just important to maybe
[1:26:48] just have a basis sort of for where we
[1:26:51] we go about this knowing that the book
[1:26:53] of remembrance is actually being written
[1:26:55] right now amen the book of remembrance
[1:26:58] is being written right now not about
[1:26:59] just what we say but about what we think
[1:27:02] remember the prophet of God said that
[1:27:03] our thoughts our thoughts are louder in
[1:27:07] heaven than our words here on
[1:27:11] Earth Joshua chapter
[1:27:17] 1 we know this is the the prophet that
[1:27:21] was in the land
[1:27:25] Moses Joshua 1 verse one now after the
[1:27:28] death of Moses the servant of the Lord
[1:27:30] it came to pass that the Lord spake unto
[1:27:33] Joshua the son of
[1:27:35] nun Moses Minister saying Moses my
[1:27:38] servant is dead now therefore rise up go
[1:27:41] over this Jordan thou and all this
[1:27:43] people unto the land which I do give to
[1:27:47] them even to the children of
[1:27:50] Israel every every place that the soul
[1:27:53] of your foot shall tread upon that have
[1:27:56] I given unto you as I said unto
[1:27:59] Moses from the Wilderness and this
[1:28:01] Lebanon even unto the Great River the
[1:28:04] river Euphrates all the land of the
[1:28:06] Hittites and unto the great sea toward
[1:28:09] the going down of the sun shall be your
[1:28:13] coasts I just think this is beautiful
[1:28:15] verse five says there shall not be any
[1:28:18] man not any man be able to stand before
[1:28:21] thee all the days of thy life as I was
[1:28:24] with Moses so I will be with thee I will
[1:28:26] not fail thee nor forsake thee
[1:28:30] amen be strong and of a good courage For
[1:28:35] unto this people shalt thou divide for
[1:28:37] an inheritance the land which I swear
[1:28:39] unto their fathers to give them only be
[1:28:42] thou strong and very courageous that
[1:28:45] thou mayest observe to do according to
[1:28:48] all the law which Moses my servant
[1:28:50] commanded thee
[1:28:52] turn not from it to the right hand or to
[1:28:55] the left that thou mayest Prosper
[1:28:58] withersoever thou
[1:29:00] goest this book of the law shall not
[1:29:03] depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt
[1:29:07] meditate therein day and night that thou
[1:29:10] mayest observe to do according to all
[1:29:12] that is written
[1:29:13] therein for then Thou shalt make thy way
[1:29:17] prosperous and then shalt thou have good
[1:29:21] success
[1:29:23] have not I commanded thee be strong and
[1:29:26] of a good courage Be not Afraid neither
[1:29:28] be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is
[1:29:32] with thee withersoever thou
[1:29:35] goest and we know right after that the
[1:29:38] very next verse Joshua commands the
[1:29:41] people he says Hey I've heard from God
[1:29:43] this is what God's told me now get ready
[1:29:47] and isn't it interesting because God
[1:29:48] never came down and spoke this to the
[1:29:50] whole Congregation of Israel no he came
[1:29:52] and spoke this to one man and it was up
[1:29:55] to the people to decide whether they
[1:29:57] should believe that man or not but there
[1:29:59] were some people in the land that had
[1:30:01] the ability to do that and you know it's
[1:30:03] no different today brothers and sisters
[1:30:04] this is the same God that came down and
[1:30:06] spoke to the children of Israel through
[1:30:08] a prophet came down and spoke to the
[1:30:10] children his children in this age
[1:30:13] through a prophet yes but you know what
[1:30:16] it takes is to be strong and very
[1:30:18] courageous that's right amen we cannot
[1:30:23] just be weak we can't be fearful we
[1:30:26] can't be afraid we can't say well you
[1:30:28] know what we prayed for brother so and
[1:30:30] so or sister so and so and nothing
[1:30:32] changed in their life we've got to be
[1:30:35] willing to take the steps forward and
[1:30:37] say you know what the word of God is yay
[1:30:40] and amen this is our absolute and it's
[1:30:43] up to him yes to bring it to pass it's
[1:30:46] not up to us to bring it to pass we
[1:30:48] can't pray God to change his mind if we
[1:30:52] do that we're doing it
[1:30:54] wrong we need to trust God with all of
[1:30:57] our hearts and lean not to our own
[1:30:59] understanding if we start leaning to our
[1:31:01] own understanding we're going to make a
[1:31:02] mess we're going to get in the way we're
[1:31:04] going to start to actually use our
[1:31:06] carnal thoughts our carnal thinking and
[1:31:08] that's where Satan's going to get in and
[1:31:09] that's why I say brothers and sisters
[1:31:11] when we get together when we go on our
[1:31:13] knees even when we listen to the message
[1:31:14] of the hour we got to go beyond this
[1:31:16] flesh we got to go beyond even our
[1:31:18] spirit we've got to go into that Soul
[1:31:20] realm and ask God God to speak to
[1:31:23] us and he
[1:31:26] will so you know talking about how
[1:31:29] Ephesians parallels the Book of Joshua
[1:31:32] in in the message's adoption brother
[1:31:34] bradam talks about this very clearly and
[1:31:37] and quite extensively how the Book of
[1:31:39] Joshua was how the children of Israel
[1:31:41] were instructed by God to walk across
[1:31:43] the Jordan River to move into that
[1:31:45] promised land that was promised all of
[1:31:47] their forefathers for for what was it
[1:31:50] 450 50 years maybe or
[1:31:53] longer the promise was there the land
[1:31:56] was there but it wasn't the right time
[1:31:59] but when that time came God sent them a
[1:32:01] prophet to say rise up everyone take
[1:32:04] note now it's time to move over into
[1:32:06] that promised land and we know that that
[1:32:09] that's exactly what happened and there
[1:32:10] were some people that were able to go
[1:32:12] and some people only wanted to go
[1:32:14] halfway and we know that they were
[1:32:16] judged for their willingness to go
[1:32:18] halfway and and we're not going to get
[1:32:20] into that today I don't want to go too
[1:32:21] far with that but we know that the Lord
[1:32:23] said to them you can come and you can
[1:32:25] have it the way you want it if that's
[1:32:26] what you want but you've got to make
[1:32:28] sure that you fight for your brothers
[1:32:29] and your sisters so that they can get
[1:32:31] into their position and I just think
[1:32:33] it's so beautiful because some people
[1:32:34] will only ever be able to come so far
[1:32:36] and that's just the way it is but other
[1:32:38] people are going to go all the way into
[1:32:40] that land and you know what alls we need
[1:32:42] to do is make sure that we block for our
[1:32:44] brother and our sister brother brandom
[1:32:46] says it when God gives the ball to
[1:32:48] someone why would you want to tackle
[1:32:49] that
[1:32:50] person block for that guy let him run
[1:32:53] let him get a touchdown and your team
[1:32:59] wins but he talks about the children of
[1:33:02] Israel in verse N Out of Joshua chapter
[1:33:05] 2 I it's such a good description
[1:33:08] brothers and sisters if we could just be
[1:33:10] able to zoom out of this natural realm
[1:33:13] and zoom into the supernatural realm
[1:33:16] into the spiritual realm and see really
[1:33:19] how Satan views us really how the
[1:33:22] inhabitants of this Promised Land the
[1:33:24] the the ones maybe not the inhabitants
[1:33:26] of the promised land of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:28] but the ones who want to block us from
[1:33:29] getting there how they see us this is
[1:33:32] the story of Rahab in you know verse 9
[1:33:35] of Joshua chapter 2 and she said unto
[1:33:37] the men the spies were there with her
[1:33:40] and she said to them the men I know that
[1:33:43] the Lord hath given you the land and
[1:33:46] that your terror is Fallen upon us and
[1:33:49] that all the inhabitants of the land
[1:33:51] faint Because of You Yes I want to say
[1:33:54] it this morning loud and clear brothers
[1:33:56] and sisters the Devils faint because of
[1:34:00] you don't think that the Devils can
[1:34:03] mount up and actually Be tendous Giants
[1:34:06] in your way and and stomp on you like an
[1:34:08] ant that's not the way it is at all
[1:34:10] they're very afraid but they're boasting
[1:34:13] they're Liars they're trying to present
[1:34:16] themselves as Giants boasting in the
[1:34:18] land but there's got to be someone like
[1:34:20] David to say where are we going to
[1:34:23] actually make a change in our lives why
[1:34:25] are we tolerating this giant in the
[1:34:28] valley of our promis land he has no
[1:34:30] right to be in that land who's going to
[1:34:33] rise up and go down and take him out in
[1:34:35] the name of the
[1:34:40] Lord for we have heard how the Lord
[1:34:42] dried up the water of the Red Sea for
[1:34:45] you oh
[1:34:47] yes sometimes I think when we look at
[1:34:49] this scripture brothers and sisters we
[1:34:51] need a book of Remembrance in our lives
[1:34:54] how many times has the Lord dried up the
[1:34:56] Red Sea for
[1:34:58] you how many times has he actually
[1:35:01] stopped the Waters of the Jordan River
[1:35:03] for you how many times has he shaken the
[1:35:06] foundations of the walls of Jericho for
[1:35:10] you oh my sometimes we need to go back
[1:35:13] and we need to look at those maybe we
[1:35:16] need to post them on our fridge or on
[1:35:17] our mirror in the morning and when the
[1:35:19] Devil comes around to make his F we need
[1:35:22] to say no don't you remember where you
[1:35:24] were defeated in the name of the Lord
[1:35:27] that was for
[1:35:29] me amen sometimes we need to remember
[1:35:31] brothers and sisters make a book of
[1:35:34] remembrance
[1:35:36] yes when you came out of Egypt and what
[1:35:39] ye did unto the two kings of the
[1:35:42] amorites that were on the other side
[1:35:45] Jordan sihon and
[1:35:47] OG whom ye utterly destroyed
[1:35:53] did they utterly destroy
[1:35:55] them they went over and they marched but
[1:35:59] God did all the work God destroyed all
[1:36:02] of the enemy in the land all they had to
[1:36:05] do was put themselves in position and be
[1:36:07] fully willing to do what the Lord said
[1:36:10] and he did it for him verse 11 and as
[1:36:12] soon as we had heard these things our
[1:36:15] heart did melt and neither did there
[1:36:18] remain any more courage in any man
[1:36:20] because of you
[1:36:22] right so just think about this brothers
[1:36:24] and sisters neither did there remain any
[1:36:26] more courage in any devil Because of You
[1:36:33] Hallelujah because for the Lord your God
[1:36:38] he is God in heaven above and in Earth
[1:36:41] beneath and isn't it true that the
[1:36:43] scripture says that the devil believes
[1:36:46] the scripture and
[1:36:49] trembles so when you get the word of God
[1:36:51] in your heart and the word of God comes
[1:36:54] out of your heart and goes on your
[1:36:57] lips it's not just you speaking brothers
[1:36:59] and sisters because it's not your word
[1:37:02] it's his
[1:37:04] word and his word is quick and powerful
[1:37:07] and you know that word quick sometimes
[1:37:10] we can say quick oh it's quick but
[1:37:12] that's not what it's saying it's
[1:37:14] life it brings life and Satan brings
[1:37:18] death so when you bring life to Satan
[1:37:21] he's got to flee it's like turning on
[1:37:23] the light Darkness flees from Light
[1:37:25] Brothers and Sisters light doesn't flee
[1:37:27] from
[1:37:29] Darkness shine a light on the devil and
[1:37:33] see what happens speak the word of God
[1:37:36] that's the age we live under brothers
[1:37:37] and sisters we're not looking for
[1:37:39] tremendous healing lines we're not
[1:37:41] looking for discernments we're looking
[1:37:43] at speaking the word and taking our
[1:37:45] inheritance being adopted Sons and
[1:37:48] Daughters of God knowing exactly where
[1:37:50] we stand knowing exactly all about it
[1:37:54] knowing exactly who we
[1:37:58] are you know Paul teaches Paul teaches
[1:38:02] in adoption that this isn't for everyone
[1:38:04] I I never really heard it this way I've
[1:38:06] just been studying this the whole series
[1:38:08] just going over it and over it and over
[1:38:10] he says this isn't for
[1:38:12] everyone it's not for
[1:38:14] everyone and and and I think it's
[1:38:16] astounding when we look at it that way
[1:38:18] but it's not for everyone the idea
[1:38:21] adoption not everyone can be adopted
[1:38:23] Sons and Daughters of God unfortunately
[1:38:25] but for those people that are if you
[1:38:27] have the ability to be an adopted son or
[1:38:29] daughter of God brothers and sisters you
[1:38:31] know it I know you know it and you know
[1:38:33] how you I know that you know it is
[1:38:36] because you keep getting up we keep
[1:38:38] getting up the devil will come around
[1:38:40] and try and knock us down and make us
[1:38:42] feel like we're beat and and we'll never
[1:38:44] be able to survive but you know there's
[1:38:46] something on the inside of the inside
[1:38:48] that says I can't quit there's no quit
[1:38:50] in me because the word of God says that
[1:38:52] everywhere the soul of my foot will
[1:38:54] tread in the promised land belongs to me
[1:38:57] so every single promise that's in the
[1:38:59] word of God pertains to you brothers and
[1:39:01] sisters pertains to me we don't have to
[1:39:03] be
[1:39:06] afraid brother bamy says this in in in
[1:39:09] the message and I didn't give it to you
[1:39:11] brother so I don't know if you'll be
[1:39:12] able to bring it up quickly but um he
[1:39:14] says now the first thing Paul starts out
[1:39:16] here I think it's an adoption
[1:39:18] too sorry Isaac really putting them on
[1:39:21] the spot now the first thing Paul starts
[1:39:23] out here to tell the people is to get
[1:39:26] all the remember this is to the church
[1:39:28] not to The
[1:39:29] Outsider it's a mystery in riddles to
[1:39:32] him never able to understand goes over
[1:39:35] the top of his
[1:39:37] head he does no more does
[1:39:40] no no more about it than
[1:39:44] nothing but to the
[1:39:46] church I want to say to the
[1:39:49] bride to the church the
[1:39:52] bride it's Honey in the
[1:39:55] Rock it's joy
[1:39:57] unspeakable it's the Blessed Assurance
[1:40:00] amen so that was out of adoption number
[1:40:02] two we've got um a few more that I did
[1:40:05] give to the the brothers I don't know if
[1:40:07] you find the email there the other thing
[1:40:10] that Paul sets out to to just establish
[1:40:14] in in in the adoption series is this
[1:40:17] notion that we can be saved today and
[1:40:21] lost
[1:40:22] tomorrow and that's a real good one
[1:40:24] that's a real good one brothers and
[1:40:26] sisters just because we struggle it
[1:40:28] doesn't mean you're lost right you're
[1:40:31] struggling because Satan wants to
[1:40:33] actually make you feel like you're lost
[1:40:36] but if you weren't struggling it would
[1:40:38] mean that there's nothing in you to
[1:40:40] actually save amen but boy oh boy when
[1:40:42] you're struggling it means that Satan
[1:40:44] knows there's something about you he
[1:40:46] knows there's something that God has in
[1:40:49] store for you and he's going to try and
[1:40:51] get us to believe that somehow we can't
[1:40:54] be saved oh because of what we've done
[1:40:56] we need to get that notion out of our
[1:40:58] heads and recognize there's nothing we
[1:41:00] could ever do to be saved except for
[1:41:02] believe it and the only way we can
[1:41:04] believe it is because he gave us his
[1:41:06] Spirit to do so so all we have to do is
[1:41:09] say Amen to the word I don't understand
[1:41:11] it I I can't make it happen but I
[1:41:14] believe
[1:41:15] it the idea the notion brother Bram says
[1:41:18] it just like this I'm not bringing up
[1:41:20] the quote he says it just like this that
[1:41:22] that notion that you can be saved today
[1:41:25] and lost tomorrow is utter nonsense
[1:41:28] right that's a denominational teaching
[1:41:30] that's the devil I want to say it this
[1:41:33] way now someone might get really upset
[1:41:35] with me but I want to say that's a
[1:41:36] trinitarian Doctrine to think that
[1:41:38] there's something that you're going to
[1:41:39] be able to do to Merit your salvation
[1:41:42] amen if you're truly the Son and
[1:41:44] Daughter of God that he's come to adopt
[1:41:47] you can never be lost the you only thing
[1:41:50] that's going to happen happen is you're
[1:41:51] going to recognize your daddy you're
[1:41:53] going to recognize God Almighty as your
[1:41:56] savior and something is going to change
[1:41:58] in your heart you can't be lost tomorrow
[1:42:02] and saved today you can't be lost today
[1:42:05] and saved tomorrow even though you could
[1:42:07] if you are but if that happens to you
[1:42:09] then you'll be saved
[1:42:11] forever amen we didn't just get saved
[1:42:14] one day we just recognized that we were
[1:42:18] always saved because we're a part of God
[1:42:22] and we can't be lost because he can't
[1:42:24] lose one part of
[1:42:26] himself remember there's only one form
[1:42:29] of life there's only one form of eternal
[1:42:31] life and that's where we get into a real
[1:42:34] interesting Doctrine that's that's part
[1:42:36] of the of the trinitarian group I would
[1:42:38] say that there is an eternal hell
[1:42:40] there's no eternal hell the word of God
[1:42:43] says that they they fry forever and ever
[1:42:46] they'll burn forever and ever with
[1:42:47] unquenchable heat but brother bradam the
[1:42:50] prophet that elah that we talked about
[1:42:52] in in Malachi chter 3 he said you know
[1:42:54] what it's a space of time forever and
[1:42:56] ever and you can't die forever because
[1:43:00] that would mean there's no eternal life
[1:43:03] if there's Eternal death we know that
[1:43:05] Eternal death is is a lie there's only
[1:43:08] one form of life and that's God's life
[1:43:11] that's eternal life and you can't have
[1:43:13] eternal life and actually go into the
[1:43:15] Lake of Fire forever and ever doesn't
[1:43:17] happen Satan wants us to think well you
[1:43:19] will oh yeah you will no you
[1:43:23] won't isn't it wonderful to think that
[1:43:25] we have a God that that is so kind and
[1:43:28] so longsuffering so wonderful that would
[1:43:30] come around and tell us that I love you
[1:43:33] that that I actually want to give you a
[1:43:35] love letter and and let you know that
[1:43:37] you're not going to be slapped around
[1:43:39] I'm not an abusive husband I'm not going
[1:43:42] to talk down to you I'm not going to
[1:43:44] belittle you with my speech I'm not
[1:43:46] going to let my anger get a hold of me
[1:43:48] and actually smack you around with my
[1:43:50] words I'm not going to grab you
[1:43:51] physically and slap you around with with
[1:43:54] my strength I'm going to tell you that I
[1:43:56] love you and that under no circumstances
[1:44:00] will I ever do anything to hurt you and
[1:44:02] that I'll do absolutely everything that
[1:44:03] I can to show you that I love you and to
[1:44:07] tell you over and over and over and over
[1:44:10] that I love you I love you I love you I
[1:44:13] just want you to love
[1:44:16] me amen you can't be saved today and
[1:44:19] lost tomorrow brothers and
[1:44:24] sisters that's a lie of the
[1:44:26] devil so if you have that feeling it's
[1:44:29] the same thing as being afraid yeah if
[1:44:33] you're afraid it's a devil right I want
[1:44:37] to say that fear this morning is a
[1:44:39] disease right just like anger is a
[1:44:45] disease but isn't this the same Lord
[1:44:48] that we're talking about that said I
[1:44:50] have healed all of your
[1:44:54] diseases not just some of them not just
[1:44:57] most of them not just maybe some of the
[1:45:00] really big ones and some of the really
[1:45:01] small ones but there's just always going
[1:45:03] to be these other ones in the middle no
[1:45:04] he said all of them brothers and sisters
[1:45:06] Hallelujah he's come to heal all of our
[1:45:08] diseases if we've got anger in our lives
[1:45:11] if we've got fear in our lives those are
[1:45:14] devils trying to tap dance on your
[1:45:18] inheritance push him back
[1:45:21] tell them that the word of God says that
[1:45:22] everywhere the soul of my foot treads in
[1:45:25] this word belongs to me this is my
[1:45:28] inheritance because Elijah did come and
[1:45:31] and he did have thus sayith the Lord to
[1:45:34] tell me that I can't be saved today and
[1:45:37] lost tomorrow that if I'm saved today
[1:45:39] I'm saved till eternity I'm saved until
[1:45:42] the day of my
[1:45:44] Redemption because we're not just saved
[1:45:46] we're sealed he
[1:45:48] says he goes on to say that when he says
[1:45:50] it's utter nonsense to think that you're
[1:45:52] going to actually be saved today and
[1:45:54] lost tomorrow you're sealed you're not
[1:45:56] just saved you're actually sealed and
[1:45:58] nobody can take off that seal we know
[1:46:00] that if if Justin Trudeau puts a seal on
[1:46:02] something and sends it out nobody's
[1:46:04] going to mess or tamper with that seal
[1:46:06] and if they do they're going to have
[1:46:07] severe consequences same thing with
[1:46:09] President Biden or Vladimir Putin or any
[1:46:11] of these really important people around
[1:46:13] the world nobody can mess with their
[1:46:14] seal think about the king of kings and
[1:46:16] Lord of lords seal nobody can tamper
[1:46:19] with that seal brothers and sisters no
[1:46:22] devil no person no denomination no
[1:46:24] nothing can tamper with that
[1:46:27] seal you know when we become adopted
[1:46:30] Sons and Daughters of God when when we
[1:46:32] actually get Beyond fear when we go into
[1:46:34] the place where maybe we just don't
[1:46:37] understand it that's exactly where he
[1:46:39] wants us to be and you know that's where
[1:46:41] we become kind and that's where we
[1:46:43] become soft that's where we become
[1:46:47] Christian which is Christlike amen not
[1:46:50] judg J mental and hard and and always
[1:46:53] contrary and always looking for some
[1:46:55] sort of critical angle and something
[1:46:57] about something no we become soft and
[1:47:00] loving because we recognize the only
[1:47:02] reason we're here is because he called
[1:47:04] us hallelujah we're as frail as frail
[1:47:07] can be we're we're we're naked we know
[1:47:09] the word of God says that all things are
[1:47:11] naked before him we can't hide nothing
[1:47:13] in our hearts that's why we need to know
[1:47:15] exactly where we stand amen something
[1:47:19] happens to us when we become adopted
[1:47:21] Sons and Daughters of God out of
[1:47:24] adoption three brother Bram he says this
[1:47:27] adoption placing
[1:47:30] positionally my this is where we got
[1:47:32] into talking about our positions as
[1:47:35] husbands and wives and children brothers
[1:47:38] and
[1:47:40] sisters adoption placing
[1:47:47] positionally got that there
[1:47:52] where they
[1:47:54] at show me where they're at God calling
[1:47:58] his children aside by
[1:48:02] what by manifestation
[1:48:05] amen they don't have to say one word
[1:48:08] about it you see Something's
[1:48:11] Happened positionally placing his son
[1:48:15] and I want to say this brothers and
[1:48:17] sisters it's not about being
[1:48:18] positionally placed in a church even
[1:48:20] though it is 100% it's not we're not
[1:48:23] talking about that today we're talking
[1:48:24] about getting into Christ we're talking
[1:48:27] about being positionally placed in
[1:48:29] Christ if we do that first if you seek
[1:48:31] first the kingdom of God then everything
[1:48:33] else will work its way out everything
[1:48:35] else will settle down and we won't have
[1:48:37] to worry positionally placing his son
[1:48:40] getting him into order just exactly with
[1:48:44] the same things he's just as in much
[1:48:48] Authority his word words just as good as
[1:48:53] an
[1:48:56] archangel can you believe that
[1:48:59] Hallelujah his word that son that's
[1:49:01] positionally placed that's adopted his
[1:49:03] son is just as good as an
[1:49:07] archangel better he says the son was
[1:49:11] adopted put on a high place set out
[1:49:13] there changed his robes changed his
[1:49:15] colors the father had a ceremony said
[1:49:18] this is my sonen from hence forth he's
[1:49:22] Governor he's the ruler he's over all my
[1:49:26] Heritage all that I got belongs to him
[1:49:29] that's right did you ever wonder this
[1:49:31] brothers and sisters I'm getting ahead
[1:49:33] of myself going to preach this sometime
[1:49:35] and maybe we will we probably will did
[1:49:37] you ever wonder why Joseph was given
[1:49:40] that robe of Many
[1:49:42] Colors did you ever wonder that I know
[1:49:44] we know the story very
[1:49:46] well but I want to say this I I believe
[1:49:49] the Lord show showing me that Joseph was
[1:49:51] adopted by his dad Joseph was given the
[1:49:55] adoption ceremony now now some might say
[1:49:57] well brother Barry think about how he
[1:49:59] was he was just a young boy and he had
[1:50:01] to go and get thrown into the pit and
[1:50:03] then he had to get sold into slavery and
[1:50:05] go into poner house and be accused and
[1:50:07] go to jail and all the stuff that
[1:50:09] happened in Joseph's life what does
[1:50:11] brother bradam say an adoption God's
[1:50:14] going to allow the devil to come around
[1:50:16] and kick you he's going to allow him to
[1:50:18] throw you out of the church he's going
[1:50:20] to allow your wife to come against you
[1:50:22] he's going to allow all these different
[1:50:24] things to happen to you just so you can
[1:50:26] show who you
[1:50:28] are if you truly are an adopted son or
[1:50:31] daughter of God and I'm getting way
[1:50:32] ahead of myself here but that's talking
[1:50:34] about the tutor he gives the little the
[1:50:36] little the little example of what the
[1:50:39] tutor and the father talk about and how
[1:50:41] the father says you know have you been
[1:50:43] dealing with my son is he in a good spot
[1:50:46] and the tutor says yeah you know I I
[1:50:48] I've done everything to him I I've let
[1:50:50] Satan come around and kick him hard and
[1:50:52] kick him out and kick him up and kick
[1:50:53] him down and all these different things
[1:50:55] and I'm just paraphrasing here but I've
[1:50:57] let him do all these different things
[1:50:59] and he just won't quit he just keeps
[1:51:02] saying praise the Lord he just keeps
[1:51:05] going to church he just keeps reading
[1:51:07] his Bible he just keeps praising the
[1:51:09] Lord he just can't stop saying Amen to
[1:51:12] the word there's something about that
[1:51:14] son or that daughter and the father said
[1:51:17] yeah that's my boy that that's a chip
[1:51:19] right off the old BL and then he goes to
[1:51:21] say imagine if that father had to hear
[1:51:24] the words oh my I've given him trials
[1:51:27] and he just gets mad and he just runs
[1:51:29] away and he just won't listen and I just
[1:51:31] can't deal with the boy brothers and
[1:51:34] sisters Sons and Daughters of God will
[1:51:36] never resist the spirit of God there
[1:51:39] will come a day and you know what I want
[1:51:42] to say it this way don't look at the
[1:51:43] time present because if we do that if we
[1:51:46] look at Joseph's life present and say
[1:51:49] well Joseph because he was adopted he
[1:51:51] should have had the cloak and got the
[1:51:53] signant and he should have gone from
[1:51:55] getting the cloak of Many Colors to
[1:51:57] going to Pharaoh right
[1:52:00] no that's not the way it works is it
[1:52:03] we've got some ground to prove who we
[1:52:05] are we've got some trials and some
[1:52:08] tribulations to go through but that's
[1:52:10] the only way that we've been created is
[1:52:12] to prove who we are through trials and
[1:52:18] tribulations
[1:52:20] don't doubt that he wasn't
[1:52:23] adopted he was prophetic and his daddy
[1:52:25] saw it and we'll get into it in the
[1:52:28] message later on I'm sure not today but
[1:52:30] someday I think it's just beautiful how
[1:52:34] even though he was
[1:52:35] adopted this adoption that we're talking
[1:52:38] about he went through great
[1:52:40] trial oh my
[1:52:42] goodness could you imagine what it would
[1:52:44] be like to be going out to see your
[1:52:46] brothers your daddy told you go see your
[1:52:48] brothers and bring me a report take them
[1:52:50] some food make some provision show them
[1:52:53] that I love them and bring me the good
[1:52:56] report you can go back and see how all
[1:52:59] his brothers came on the scene a and it
[1:53:01] wasn't a a Bed of Roses brothers and
[1:53:04] sisters the 12 tribes of Israel didn't
[1:53:07] come
[1:53:08] easy right but this one son goes out to
[1:53:11] give a report and what does his brothers
[1:53:13] do they say oh here comes that dreamer
[1:53:16] again let's get him once and for all
[1:53:18] let's put him away from us because all
[1:53:20] he does is upsets our program all he
[1:53:22] does is harp on the trinitarian
[1:53:27] doctrine but let's do something about
[1:53:29] him once and for all and we know that
[1:53:32] there was one brother that stood up for
[1:53:33] him we know Reuben is the one that
[1:53:35] stepped into the breach to say hey let's
[1:53:37] not kill him let's just throw him in the
[1:53:39] pit and we know that that wasn't Reuben
[1:53:41] he was acting on behalf of God you know
[1:53:43] the story we know the story I'm going
[1:53:45] off on a tangent here but it's just
[1:53:47] wonderful if you're going through a
[1:53:49] fiery trial brothers and sisters count
[1:53:50] it better than gold in your life oh my I
[1:53:54] say Lord help me because I know where
[1:53:56] this goes when we talk like this
[1:53:57] something's going to happen but you know
[1:53:59] what it's only going to happen to bring
[1:54:00] the glory of God out in my life all
[1:54:03] we're going to be able to do is look
[1:54:05] back and say look at that time he
[1:54:07] delivered me from that look at how he
[1:54:08] brought us through that you know many
[1:54:10] times the trials that we go through are
[1:54:13] great
[1:54:15] heartaches but you know I want to say
[1:54:18] this
[1:54:20] and it's sometimes easier said than done
[1:54:23] when the going gets tough what
[1:54:26] happens do the tough just run
[1:54:29] away no they dig in and they get going
[1:54:34] the tough don't give
[1:54:35] up now maybe that's just a worldly
[1:54:38] carnal example and maybe forgive me if
[1:54:40] you feel that's the way it is but I just
[1:54:42] truly believe that's the way it is
[1:54:44] because when we've got the spirit of God
[1:54:46] we're not afraid we're not worried we're
[1:54:49] not concerned that it's out of control
[1:54:52] because we know who's in control and
[1:54:55] when we get concerned and upset and
[1:54:57] worried and a fearful nature takes over
[1:55:01] us in a situation we're showing God that
[1:55:04] we don't believe he's in
[1:55:07] control brothers and sisters show them
[1:55:09] he's in control tell them he's in
[1:55:12] control let him know that you know he's
[1:55:15] in control he wants to know that he
[1:55:18] wants to hear that conf confession on
[1:55:20] our lips
[1:55:22] yes my
[1:55:24] goodness out of adoption number
[1:55:28] two I think it's so
[1:55:32] beautiful and the possession that the
[1:55:34] promise that was given to the
[1:55:36] church is not a natural
[1:55:39] land just want to take the time to talk
[1:55:43] on these things and see what the Lord
[1:55:45] will do maybe we'll have another service
[1:55:47] about this I just believe adoption is so
[1:55:49] so vital brothers and sisters it's
[1:55:52] excuse me it's really our promise it's
[1:55:54] really what it's all about this is the
[1:55:56] message of the hour it's not just being
[1:55:58] a part of a membership or an association
[1:56:01] or a group of people if we can say God
[1:56:03] sent a prophet and quote quotes and have
[1:56:05] books and it's not about that it's
[1:56:08] understanding that there's a possession
[1:56:10] we've been given a promise brother
[1:56:12] brandham says and the possession that
[1:56:14] the promise was given to the church is
[1:56:17] not a natural land but a spirit ual land
[1:56:20] for we are a royal priesthood a holy
[1:56:24] nation then in this royal priesthood
[1:56:28] holy nation peculiar people called out
[1:56:32] elected chosen set aside then all the
[1:56:36] world is dead on the outside amen and we
[1:56:39] are led by the spirit amen Sons and
[1:56:43] Daughters of God are led by the spirit
[1:56:45] of God not by man but by the spirit amen
[1:56:51] I just think it's so good the more we
[1:56:54] fall in love with God the more that we
[1:56:56] fall in love with
[1:56:58] Christ the more we fall out of love with
[1:57:00] the world because the word of God says
[1:57:03] that if you love the world or the things
[1:57:06] of the world
[1:57:09] what it's not even in
[1:57:12] you my goodness not for an adopted son
[1:57:15] or daughter of God though I'm not saying
[1:57:18] that to make us afraid to think that one
[1:57:20] day it could just slip away no no no no
[1:57:21] no I'm I'm saying it I'm saying all this
[1:57:24] to help us identify that the true Sons
[1:57:26] and Daughters of God have got real real
[1:57:29] tangible identifiers in their lives so
[1:57:32] we're not wondering we're not
[1:57:35] questioning but I just think it's
[1:57:37] amazing this one floored me when it came
[1:57:39] to the message of the hour that brother
[1:57:41] bradam he he made it real clear that
[1:57:43] it's not works of
[1:57:46] righteousness it's by his grace alone
[1:57:49] amen amen it's not by having a great
[1:57:51] prayer line it's not by having
[1:57:53] tremendous prayers answered it's not by
[1:57:55] seeing all Mighty signs and wonders
[1:57:58] that's not it at all it's our ability to
[1:58:00] actually say Amen to the word and not
[1:58:02] just say Amen in church even though you
[1:58:05] should it's living
[1:58:07] it it's taking this message of the hour
[1:58:10] and saying it's my absolute because the
[1:58:12] message of the hour amplifies the
[1:58:15] Bible it's like taking a guitar I don't
[1:58:18] even play it but I know what happen
[1:58:19] happens if you take a guitar and play it
[1:58:21] it sounds good I'm sure especially if
[1:58:23] you could play it but if you plug it
[1:58:25] into an amplifier and you turn the
[1:58:26] volume up brothers and sisters it does
[1:58:28] something doesn't it the Brandon goes on
[1:58:31] to say all in love the whole thing is
[1:58:33] bundled up now this has been tried to be
[1:58:36] taught on many times and no doubt what
[1:58:39] great theologians has struck it a lot
[1:58:41] deeper than I could bring but the thing
[1:58:44] I want to try to get to you is
[1:58:47] this that a man that is in
[1:58:50] Christ with the Holy
[1:58:53] Ghost can bear with a man when he's
[1:58:58] wrong amen
[1:59:01] wow you know sometimes you see it that a
[1:59:04] man is in Christ without the Holy Ghost
[1:59:08] and he just can't bear with that man he
[1:59:10] just can't bear with a man even if he's
[1:59:11] wrong especially if he's wrong but you
[1:59:14] get a man who's in
[1:59:17] Christ who has the Holy Ghost
[1:59:20] he's going to bear with a man even when
[1:59:21] he's wrong and trust God to turn the
[1:59:25] tide trust God to change the
[1:59:27] situation amen that
[1:59:31] man he's going to be
[1:59:33] longsuffering he's going to be
[1:59:35] gentle he's going to be
[1:59:37] patient he's going to be sweet he's
[1:59:41] going to be
[1:59:42] humble he's going to be faithful he's
[1:59:45] going to be filled with the
[1:59:47] spirit never NE
[1:59:49] negative always
[1:59:52] positive he's a different
[1:59:55] person there is
[1:59:57] identifiers in those truly elected Sons
[2:00:01] and Daughters of
[2:00:03] God it's not like we can just say hey
[2:00:06] I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them
[2:00:08] even though we can when we know who we
[2:00:11] are but there's a life that lives out
[2:00:13] through US amen this isn't just
[2:00:15] something that you think about right we
[2:00:19] know that this is the word of God we'll
[2:00:20] get into it I think it's beautiful here
[2:00:22] but when someone is longsuffering that
[2:00:25] is an action right when you're
[2:00:27] longsuffering it's an action when you're
[2:00:30] gentle it's an action when you're
[2:00:32] patient it's an action when you're sweet
[2:00:35] all of these things humble faithful
[2:00:38] filled with the spirit never negative
[2:00:40] always positive we're demonstrating
[2:00:42] actions in our lives we're showing the
[2:00:45] Life of Christ to the world around
[2:00:48] us
[2:00:50] and I just want to say it this way I'll
[2:00:52] plug it in there don't just save it for
[2:00:54] the the people outside of your
[2:00:58] home don't save it for the people
[2:01:00] outside of your home let that life exude
[2:01:04] your
[2:01:05] home that's where it counts the most
[2:01:07] brothers and
[2:01:10] sisters out of adoption number three
[2:01:12] brother bradam says you notice that
[2:01:16] sins a sinner is not a sin
[2:01:20] what a sinner is not a sinner he does
[2:01:25] not commit sins are you
[2:01:27] serious a sinner is not a sinner he does
[2:01:30] not commit
[2:01:32] sins
[2:01:34] wow but the church commits sins is he
[2:01:37] getting this right
[2:01:39] yes when I was listening to this when I
[2:01:42] was studying this and reading this I had
[2:01:43] to go back and just pause here and think
[2:01:46] what's
[2:01:47] what but the church chur commits sins
[2:01:50] does wrong gets a wrong thought wrong
[2:01:56] impression make
[2:01:59] Scruples brothers and sisters don't get
[2:02:01] the wrong
[2:02:02] impression the word of God says that if
[2:02:04] there's a to go to your
[2:02:07] brother that's the devil he wants to get
[2:02:10] in and get us to have thoughts he wants
[2:02:13] to get us to have the wrong impression
[2:02:15] of something he wants to get us to have
[2:02:17] Scruples and and wobble a bit but isn't
[2:02:20] it interesting to see how God sees us
[2:02:22] here he's talking about God viewing us
[2:02:25] the church gets the wrong impression
[2:02:27] makes Scruples wobbles like a little
[2:02:28] child walking learning how to
[2:02:32] walk he just don't know how to walk good
[2:02:35] yet yeah because he's a little
[2:02:38] boy but we have a hand that reaches down
[2:02:41] oh my it's not wonderful to
[2:02:44] think we're all just Sons and Daughters
[2:02:47] of God just trying to learn to walk
[2:02:49] we're in a one room Schoolhouse and some
[2:02:51] people are already uh past the
[2:02:53] stratosphere spiritually speaking and
[2:02:55] some people are still in the
[2:02:57] womb right it's not up to us to say
[2:03:00] anything about anyone it is up to us to
[2:03:03] actually demonstrate the life that we're
[2:03:04] talking about in the message of the hour
[2:03:06] and that is to extend that hand of
[2:03:09] Fellowship to say if someone's in the
[2:03:11] ditch we're going to pull them
[2:03:13] out we're not going to judge someone
[2:03:16] we're not going to form an opinion
[2:03:18] because we can see they're scrupled up
[2:03:20] we're going to say to them
[2:03:21] brother just get
[2:03:24] up dust yourself off keep
[2:03:28] going he just don't know how to walk
[2:03:30] good yet cuz he's a little boy but we
[2:03:32] have a hand that reaches down if we gets
[2:03:36] us and steadies us and say make this
[2:03:39] step a way make this a step away my son
[2:03:44] doesn't pick us up and spank us because
[2:03:46] we made a mistake isn't that wonderful
[2:03:49] yes amen that makes me think how dare we
[2:03:53] think that we could pick someone up and
[2:03:54] give them a
[2:03:56] spanking right our brothers and our
[2:03:58] sisters because I'm a spiritual giant oh
[2:04:00] my I can see this I can discern this in
[2:04:02] your life I need to actually take you
[2:04:05] aside and tell you all about it how you
[2:04:07] can be more spiritual and and better
[2:04:09] with your life are you serious that's
[2:04:11] not the way God treats us now remember
[2:04:14] the story about the man who was forgiven
[2:04:16] the tremendous debt that humongous Deb
[2:04:19] multi-millions of dollars worth of debt
[2:04:22] he was forgiven by the king but then
[2:04:24] that dude once he was all forgiven he
[2:04:26] got all puffed up with pride and said
[2:04:29] man I'm good aren't I oh yeah God's
[2:04:32] forgiven me and my business is good and
[2:04:34] my family is good and my church is
[2:04:36] everything is under my control I'm so
[2:04:39] full of Pride and I'm going to go and
[2:04:41] collect from that one guy that's been
[2:04:42] messing me over for
[2:04:44] years remember that what happened
[2:04:49] he was taken before the king the story
[2:04:50] got back to the king to say hey didn't I
[2:04:52] forgive you didn't I forgive you like
[2:04:55] multiple times way more than this
[2:04:57] dude but now because you've been that
[2:05:00] way I'm sorry but you're going to have
[2:05:02] your punishment and we know that it's
[2:05:04] actually it switches from being a
[2:05:06] natural example to being a spiritual
[2:05:08] example he'll be cast out where there's
[2:05:10] wailing and nashing of teeth right
[2:05:12] that's what will happen to him you know
[2:05:13] we don't want to ever ever think that we
[2:05:15] can judge a brother or a sister what we
[2:05:18] want to do is pray for a brother or a
[2:05:20] sister and we want to encourage a
[2:05:22] brother or a sister if we're a spiritual
[2:05:24] giant especially am I think it's so
[2:05:27] beautiful though we could just go a long
[2:05:29] long long long ways we know that the
[2:05:31] disciples they stopped the children when
[2:05:33] they came at Jesus I just love this
[2:05:34] don't you love the word of God how he
[2:05:36] used the examples the children wanted to
[2:05:38] be touched by Jesus people wanted Jesus
[2:05:40] to touch the children and the disciples
[2:05:42] got in the away the religious ones and
[2:05:43] said no no no keep them down they're
[2:05:45] going to get something maybe they'll get
[2:05:47] jam on his his Ro Rob or something from
[2:05:49] their peanut butter and jam sandwich you
[2:05:51] know they just make a mess of him don't
[2:05:52] let them go and Bug the master and he
[2:05:54] said no no no no suffer the children to
[2:05:56] come unto me because unless you come as
[2:05:57] one of these ones you won't even see the
[2:05:59] Kingdom of
[2:06:01] Heaven think about the prayers of the
[2:06:03] children brothers and sisters isn't it
[2:06:05] wonderful we can say ignorance is bliss
[2:06:07] they don't know about all the different
[2:06:09] things they don't know about all the
[2:06:10] different hurts they don't know about
[2:06:12] all the different problems and all the
[2:06:13] situations that have happened or the
[2:06:15] things that could potentially happen out
[2:06:17] there they're just children I say Lord
[2:06:20] let us just be children let us just be
[2:06:23] children and and reach for that hand
[2:06:26] hold to God's unchanging hand if we can
[2:06:29] do that then we will actually see a
[2:06:32] difference in our lives he says he
[2:06:34] doesn't pick us up and spank us because
[2:06:36] we make a mistake he doesn't beat us to
[2:06:38] death because we're trying to walk he
[2:06:41] loves us like we love our children
[2:06:45] amen he loves us like we love our
[2:06:47] children a real daddy wouldn't whip his
[2:06:50] child if he's trying to walk if he falls
[2:06:53] down on the floor reach right down with
[2:06:56] big strong hand and pick him up take
[2:06:59] both hands a hold of him say this is the
[2:07:01] way to do it son Walk This
[2:07:04] Way pick them up and dust them off say I
[2:07:07] love you you're doing such a good job
[2:07:10] keep going son that's the God we serve
[2:07:13] this is the prophet for our day telling
[2:07:15] us this is how God sees us to me it
[2:07:17] makes me feel good to know that just
[2:07:19] because I have a struggle just because I
[2:07:21] have a trial just because I feel like I
[2:07:23] fell down it doesn't mean that I've lost
[2:07:26] doesn't mean that I can't come back it
[2:07:28] means that he loves me and he's allowing
[2:07:32] the Devil to come around and straighten
[2:07:34] out these things in my
[2:07:36] life we have the ability to Rejoice
[2:07:38] brothers and sisters he goes on to say
[2:07:40] that's the way God does his church
[2:07:42] reaches down and gets him in his arm
[2:07:45] picks him up and say walk like this son
[2:07:49] here don't don't say it like that talk
[2:07:51] like
[2:07:52] this you ever have that
[2:07:55] happen speaking and suddenly something
[2:07:58] happens it happens to me all the time
[2:07:59] when I'm standing up here but we have it
[2:08:02] happen sometimes in our lives we'll say
[2:08:03] something and something will say you
[2:08:05] shouldn't have said that shouldn't have
[2:08:07] said it that way right and we got to do
[2:08:09] something about it at that point forgive
[2:08:11] me Lord forgive me brother forgive me
[2:08:13] sister maybe we need to actually go
[2:08:16] around the long way go and have a coffee
[2:08:19] and it gets a little uncomfortable and
[2:08:22] we got to go and see a brother and a
[2:08:23] sister and you know maybe say to them
[2:08:25] hey I'm so sorry but I've said these
[2:08:27] things about you behind your back and I
[2:08:29] I know maybe you know or maybe you don't
[2:08:31] know but I know that I said them and I
[2:08:34] know they were wrong and I just pray
[2:08:36] that you'd forgive me because that's
[2:08:37] what the word of God says and you know
[2:08:38] brothers and sisters unless we do that
[2:08:40] all that we do we talked about this
[2:08:42] years ago is we just take that sin and
[2:08:45] we just take it and we put it in our
[2:08:47] backpack and you know many times we'll
[2:08:50] say oh I've I've asked God to forgive me
[2:08:51] for that sin I talk to my brother about
[2:08:53] my brother and my sister and you know
[2:08:55] this thing has happened and it's
[2:08:56] terrible and I I've I've I've slayed
[2:08:59] them but I've asked God to forgive me so
[2:09:01] it's all good it's okay God's forgiven
[2:09:04] me what did God say to the the the
[2:09:07] brother that came with his sacrifice
[2:09:10] Jesus he told him hey just leave your
[2:09:12] leave your offering right here leave
[2:09:14] your gift right here at the altar and go
[2:09:16] and make it right with your brother and
[2:09:18] your sister and then come back and your
[2:09:20] offering will be accepted and we know
[2:09:22] that's the same thing that Cain was
[2:09:23] offered if you would just do like your
[2:09:25] brother have we got the ability to get
[2:09:27] Beyond ourselves to get past ourselves
[2:09:30] enough to go and do that that's not an
[2:09:32] easy thing to do I say Lord help
[2:09:36] me Bram says here don't don't say like
[2:09:39] that talk like
[2:09:41] this now I don't care what the church
[2:09:43] says what this says what that says you
[2:09:47] say it like like this like this this is
[2:09:51] it if my word preaches it you stay right
[2:09:54] with it walk with it stay right with it
[2:09:58] don't care what everybody else says stay
[2:10:02] right with it walk like this this is the
[2:10:05] way to make your steps and I just can't
[2:10:09] help but think that's why we come to
[2:10:11] church that's why we we spend time in
[2:10:14] prayer that's why we read the word of
[2:10:16] God because we want have that
[2:10:18] instruction from him that's how he
[2:10:20] speaks to
[2:10:22] us that's his chosen
[2:10:25] way we know it's by Revelation and we
[2:10:27] we've talked about it and we'll continue
[2:10:29] on with it I'm sure but I think
[2:10:31] sometimes it can actually almost be a
[2:10:33] bit overwhelming to think that the I I
[2:10:36] just think the saturation of Revelation
[2:10:38] in this day brothers and sisters you
[2:10:40] know what I'm saying how much revelation
[2:10:42] we have in our day if you talk to some
[2:10:44] of the oldtimers and and they talk about
[2:10:47] the way the message of the hour was back
[2:10:48] when maybe the seventh seal was preached
[2:10:50] brother brandom said to them do you
[2:10:52] understand it and a lot of the people
[2:10:54] say yeah and we know that Billy Paul he
[2:10:56] asked him one time after a service do
[2:10:57] you understand
[2:10:59] it
[2:11:00] yeah and what did he say did you
[2:11:02] understand that Billy Paul yeah and he
[2:11:04] said brother Billy Paul did you
[2:11:07] understand that and he said no no Daddy
[2:11:10] because it wasn't for them but think
[2:11:13] about it brothers and sisters it's for
[2:11:14] you yes it's for me it's for us to have
[2:11:17] the revelation being an adopted son and
[2:11:19] daughter of God we can have Satan
[2:11:21] powerless before us if we're willing to
[2:11:23] come according to the direction we've
[2:11:24] been
[2:11:25] given who doesn't want Satan to be
[2:11:28] powerless before you today I believe
[2:11:31] every one of us wants to go out and
[2:11:32] tread on the heads of
[2:11:34] serpents to know that you have absolute
[2:11:37] Authority when you speak it's not you
[2:11:39] speaking it's God speaking through
[2:11:43] you I just want to say it if you have
[2:11:46] the Holy Ghost In You brothers and
[2:11:47] sisters don't put that off to another
[2:11:49] day got the Holy Ghost in you speak the
[2:11:51] word and go forwards and don't be afraid
[2:11:54] because everywhere the soul of your foot
[2:11:56] Treads is your
[2:11:59] possession in adoption number three
[2:12:02] brother Bram he says by Revelation it's
[2:12:05] by Revelation brothers and sisters it's
[2:12:06] all by
[2:12:08] Revelation that's where I was talking
[2:12:10] about how it can just almost seem like a
[2:12:13] a saturation of it and and sometimes we
[2:12:16] say it so many times it can it can
[2:12:18] almost just be overwhelming to think
[2:12:20] about Revelation because the prophet
[2:12:22] said that we can never overemphasize the
[2:12:25] importance of Revelation because truly
[2:12:27] that's God speaking to his children
[2:12:29] directly that's God speaking to his wife
[2:12:32] directly when when something happens
[2:12:34] through Revelation to us and we say I
[2:12:37] got this idea I got this thought I got
[2:12:39] this thing in my heart and I just don't
[2:12:41] understand it if you take it back to the
[2:12:42] word of God and it resonates if this
[2:12:44] word of God flashes like the Yum Thum in
[2:12:47] in the in the Old Testament then you can
[2:12:50] rest assured that's God speaking
[2:12:51] directly to your heart brothers and
[2:12:53] sisters and I would say this I would
[2:12:54] encourage you to keep doing what you're
[2:12:56] doing because God is speaking to you
[2:12:59] directly that Revelation is what we're
[2:13:01] after because that revelation will never
[2:13:03] be contrary to the word of God and when
[2:13:05] you hear someone come up with a
[2:13:07] revelation that's contrary to the word
[2:13:09] of God you got to say God bless you I I
[2:13:12] I I believe that maybe God spoke to you
[2:13:14] somehow but I just don't understand it
[2:13:16] but that doesn't mean that you're not my
[2:13:18] brother doesn't mean that you're not my
[2:13:19] sister I just don't see it in the word
[2:13:21] of God so I'm going to pray that maybe
[2:13:23] either you'll change your ways or that
[2:13:25] I'll be able to see it in the word of
[2:13:27] God but I'm not going to slander
[2:13:29] you Paul said over here I can show you
[2:13:32] in the scripture that he said he had to
[2:13:35] forget everything that he ever
[2:13:39] learned and counted as nothing that he
[2:13:42] might know
[2:13:45] Christ oh he says
[2:13:49] neither went I up to Jerusalem to them
[2:13:51] which were Apostles before me but I went
[2:13:54] to
[2:13:55] Arabia and turned again to
[2:13:58] Damascus Paul went out into the
[2:14:01] Wilderness he had to actually go in the
[2:14:03] book of Hebrews brother Bram this Hebrew
[2:14:05] study it's so beautiful he goes in there
[2:14:08] and he says that Paul had to go and
[2:14:11] verify the
[2:14:12] experience by the word he didn't take a
[2:14:16] man's reasoning for it he had had to go
[2:14:18] into Arabia by himself and have a
[2:14:20] conversation with god sometimes I think
[2:14:23] we just need to get away we just need to
[2:14:25] steal away and have some time with God
[2:14:27] so he can speak to us he goes on to say
[2:14:29] neither went I up to Jerusalem to them
[2:14:31] which were Apostles before me but I went
[2:14:33] to Arabia and turned again to Damascus
[2:14:36] and after three years I went up to
[2:14:38] Jerusalem to see Peter and Abode with
[2:14:40] him 15
[2:14:42] days it's a beautiful story that part of
[2:14:45] the story goes on as as we read on we
[2:14:49] find out that he and the Apostle Peter
[2:14:52] never seen one another in life did you
[2:14:55] ever think about that they had never
[2:14:57] seen each other in this in this world
[2:15:00] but what happened was they got together
[2:15:03] and they were preaching the very same
[2:15:05] gospel how were they doing that
[2:15:08] Revelation by the
[2:15:10] spirit and that's the thing with the
[2:15:12] Believers today brothers and sisters we
[2:15:14] could go anywhere in the world and
[2:15:15] connect with Believers Believers of this
[2:15:17] word for our day and it's just like we
[2:15:19] are brothers and sisters and we go way
[2:15:21] back before the foundation of the world
[2:15:24] we have a connection that goes even
[2:15:26] stronger even even is different than kin
[2:15:28] even we we can't even explain it it's a
[2:15:31] supernatural connection he says as we
[2:15:33] read on we find out that he and the
[2:15:34] Apostle Peter never seen one another in
[2:15:36] life never knowed one another never seen
[2:15:39] one another but when they come together
[2:15:41] they were preaching the same gospel
[2:15:43] God's got a school see and that school
[2:15:46] brothers and sisters is Revel
[2:15:48] by the spirit it's got to be the person
[2:15:51] in Christ with the Holy Ghost not just
[2:15:53] the person in Christ claiming Christ
[2:15:55] Jesus it's got to be the person in
[2:15:58] Christ Jesus with the Holy Ghost the
[2:16:00] baptism of the Holy Spirit and what
[2:16:02] happens is you become an adopted son and
[2:16:05] daughter of God don't think that you're
[2:16:06] getting a fiery trial because you're not
[2:16:08] an adopted son and daughter of God think
[2:16:10] that you are an adopted son and daughter
[2:16:12] of God if you've got a fiery trial
[2:16:14] there's a reason why we go and get
[2:16:16] thrown into the pit there's reason why
[2:16:18] we get sold into slavery there's a
[2:16:20] reason why we've got to go to prison and
[2:16:22] be falsely
[2:16:24] accused because we are adopted Sons and
[2:16:26] Daughters of
[2:16:28] God not because we're going to be
[2:16:30] because we are
[2:16:32] already you know we need to close here
[2:16:34] soon
[2:16:37] boy don't you just love the word of God
[2:16:39] Amen Oh my bring it God manifests
[2:16:42] himself in adoption number
[2:16:45] three God trying to place his church
[2:16:47] Church in position to manifest
[2:16:50] himself I I I just got into that I heard
[2:16:54] that and again I was like
[2:16:56] my God trying to place his church into
[2:16:59] position I always thought it was so that
[2:17:01] he could have a Rapture I always thought
[2:17:03] it was so that we we were going to you
[2:17:05] know be that glorious Church Without a
[2:17:07] spot a wrinkle and I think all of that
[2:17:09] is true yeah but to hear the words of
[2:17:11] the Prophet sometimes and to hear what
[2:17:13] he's saying God trying to place his
[2:17:15] church in position to manif EST
[2:17:21] himself he's not looking to manifest
[2:17:23] himself somewhere out there I'm just
[2:17:25] saying it slowly like that just to let
[2:17:27] it sink just to let it saturate us with
[2:17:29] that that Revelation his church in
[2:17:31] position to manifest himself getting one
[2:17:34] that he can work through like this say
[2:17:36] there's my spirit flowing freely there
[2:17:39] it is that I can work here get another
[2:17:43] one over here and place him I can place
[2:17:46] him adoption adopting placing
[2:17:50] manifesting that's where I want to end
[2:17:52] up today brothers and sisters is
[2:17:54] manifesting there's the adoption process
[2:17:56] there's the positionally placing process
[2:17:58] but then there's the manifestation of
[2:18:00] the spirit and you know what that's the
[2:18:02] true identification if we truly are an
[2:18:05] adopted son and daughter of God if we
[2:18:07] truly are a spiritual Giant and we are
[2:18:10] in that position we've been in the
[2:18:12] message our whole entire lives and we've
[2:18:13] never had any sin in our lives and we're
[2:18:16] strong Christians if we're that way then
[2:18:18] we're going to have a manifestation of
[2:18:21] his spirit in our lives and it's not
[2:18:22] going to be our lips it's going to be
[2:18:25] the life we live Amen to those people
[2:18:27] around us and those people around us are
[2:18:30] going to be the ones that bear witness
[2:18:31] that yep there's something different
[2:18:33] about that person there's something that
[2:18:35] just lines up with the word of God they
[2:18:36] are gentle they are sweet they are
[2:18:38] humble they they they know that they're
[2:18:40] placed and they're manifesting brother
[2:18:42] bam says to take him out here and put a
[2:18:45] ceremony on him visit him with an an
[2:18:49] angel have you been visited by an Angel
[2:18:52] I should call the
[2:18:53] musicians tell him something now if he's
[2:18:57] told the truth now if he's just making
[2:19:00] up something it won't
[2:19:01] work nah that won't work we've had a lot
[2:19:05] of that but I mean manifestations of
[2:19:08] sons of God when God manifests
[2:19:14] himself and sends him out then he Goes
[2:19:18] Forth and what he says is truth what he
[2:19:22] does is the
[2:19:24] truth what he does he manifests
[2:19:29] Christ how you judge
[2:19:32] him this is the critical
[2:19:39] Factor this is the critical Factor
[2:19:41] brothers and sisters how do you judge
[2:19:44] him by the way he stays with the word
[2:19:47] amen right with the word see and and
[2:19:51] what word we could say the word of God
[2:19:54] which is
[2:19:55] true but we know that we've had an
[2:19:57] amplification of the word of God in our
[2:19:59] day we've had a Prophet come on the
[2:20:02] scene to take us right back to the truth
[2:20:05] to give us the ability to see between
[2:20:07] the lines to recognize that just a a
[2:20:10] baptism in the name of of of a title and
[2:20:13] a name of another title and the name of
[2:20:14] another title that's not going to Merit
[2:20:16] us gift the true gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:20:19] we got a prophet in our day that gave us
[2:20:21] the correct formula of water baptism and
[2:20:24] that's why this message is so contested
[2:20:26] right because it comes against that
[2:20:28] trinitarian Doctrine but I just love it
[2:20:30] how the prophet said it and I'll say it
[2:20:32] just what he said show me anywhere in
[2:20:33] the Bible that they baptize in the name
[2:20:35] of the father and the Son and the Holy
[2:20:36] Ghost and we'll put a name on on our
[2:20:38] backs and say that we believe a false
[2:20:40] prophet show us in the Bible don't show
[2:20:42] us according to a theological study
[2:20:44] somewhere what what a certificate from a
[2:20:47] a a seminary teaching gave
[2:20:50] us show us in the word of God right amen
[2:20:55] amen but what does what what he does is
[2:20:59] truth what he does is he manifests
[2:21:02] Christ Sons and Daughters of God adopted
[2:21:05] Sons and Daughters of God they they
[2:21:07] manifest Christ it's not them one day
[2:21:11] and Christ another day it's the solid
[2:21:15] stalwart individual that's the same
[2:21:19] person how do you judge him though by
[2:21:22] the way he stays with the word right
[2:21:24] with the word
[2:21:26] see we can be up and we can be down
[2:21:29] maybe stand with me as we close we can
[2:21:31] bounce all around Satan's going to come
[2:21:33] around and say don't you remember you
[2:21:34] got a temper you got a temper buddy you
[2:21:38] like to get mad you like to punch things
[2:21:40] you like to kick things you like to
[2:21:42] throw things you like to act this
[2:21:44] certain way maybe you like to look at
[2:21:47] these these things maybe you like to
[2:21:48] drink these things we need a prayer that
[2:21:51] will take those drinks out of our
[2:21:54] lives like we heard about last week but
[2:21:57] you know Satan's going to come around
[2:21:58] and try and remind us of who we used to
[2:22:01] be but I want to say this brothers and
[2:22:03] sisters you never were that don't let
[2:22:07] Satan lie to you amen because you never
[2:22:11] were whatever the LIE is he's trying to
[2:22:13] give
[2:22:14] you you are always yes Son of God you
[2:22:18] are always a daughter of God and you
[2:22:20] don't have to listen to the
[2:22:24] devil what identifies
[2:22:27] you how will he judge you by the way you
[2:22:30] stay with the word he says right with
[2:22:33] the word see that's how you know all men
[2:22:36] is by the way he stays with the word if
[2:22:40] they speak not according to the word
[2:22:43] there's no life in them says the
[2:22:46] Bible see leave them
[2:22:50] away we have identification brothers and
[2:22:53] sisters we said it earlier but we're
[2:22:55] closing now it's not a membership card
[2:22:59] or an association it's not a not a not a
[2:23:03] not a membership Galatians 5 says but
[2:23:06] the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[2:23:10] peace longsuffering gentleness and
[2:23:13] goodness Faith meekness
[2:23:18] Temperance against such there is no
[2:23:23] law and they that are christs have
[2:23:27] crucified the flesh with the affections
[2:23:30] and
[2:23:31] lusts if we live in the spirit I love
[2:23:35] this part brothers and sisters because
[2:23:36] it's easy for us to live in the spirit
[2:23:39] but if we live in the spirit let us also
[2:23:42] walk in the spirit if we live in the
[2:23:45] spirit and we talk about the Spirit a
[2:23:48] and maybe we quote about the spirit and
[2:23:50] we present the spirit this is who we
[2:23:53] are let's live it let's walk in the
[2:23:57] spirit let's demonstrate to this world
[2:23:59] around us this is who we are because
[2:24:01] talk is cheap the world's going to
[2:24:04] recognize us right away who we are and
[2:24:06] it's going to be the spirits that are in
[2:24:08] the other people they're going to say oh
[2:24:09] my we can't swear around this brother we
[2:24:11] better apologize without saying a word
[2:24:13] you don't say a word to them and they
[2:24:15] just know it how do they know it because
[2:24:17] the spirit that's inside of you beareth
[2:24:19] witness his Spirit beareth witness with
[2:24:22] ours that we are the sons of God if we
[2:24:25] live in the spirit brothers and sisters
