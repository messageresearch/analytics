[43:17] Silas father they were beaten for the

[44:49] we had some requests before last year
[44:51] that there was a uh trouble with the
[44:54] lights shining down in people eyes and
[44:56] some people are sensitive to light and
[44:59] so we took a look at it and we were able
[45:01] to adjust them and it certainly feels
[45:03] different in here tonight and uh I trust
[45:06] it's okay we can certainly take a look
[45:08] at it in the future if we need to but uh

[47:13] a happy New Year upon us I trust it's a
[47:16] happy New Year so far and that it
[47:18] remains a Happy New Year I just pray
[47:20] that this will be the happiest year of
[47:23] Our Lives as we have this revelation
[47:25] about the word for our day and the
[47:27] Revelation about who we are um God bless
[47:31] you and happy New
[47:32] Year um January we'll get back to our
[47:36] our regular scheduled programming we're
[47:38] going to have uh couple of prayer
[47:40] meetings this month on the 11th and the
[47:43] 25th we're going to have a youth meeting
[47:46] on the 21st I believe it is and we're
[47:49] going to have a communion service on the
[47:50] 28th which is the last Sunday of the
[47:53] month so I trust that works for everyone
[47:55] if you have any questions by all means
[47:57] refer to the calendar and uh or just
[48:00] Reach Out And Touch the
[48:05] Lord in our scripture tonight
[48:07] Revelations 1 to8 we know that this is
[48:09] the the revelation of Jesus Christ and
[48:12] and that's what the Book of Revelation
[48:14] is uh many times folks would say it's
[48:16] the The Book of Revelation meaning
[48:18] apocalypse it's the end of the world
[48:20] it's the seals it's the vials it's the
[48:22] trumpets it's the church ages it's
[48:25] what's going to happen happened to the
[48:26] world and how there's a new Heaven and a
[48:27] new Earth and it is but all of it
[48:30] brothers and sisters we know is the
[48:32] revelation of Jesus Christ and and that
[48:36] is what it takes for us to be able to
[48:38] get Revelation by the spirit you
[48:40] probably have heard me say it over and
[48:42] over again and and maybe you can just
[48:45] see why I'll just jump to it if you have
[48:48] the the book of the exposition of the
[48:50] seven Church ages with you um it's
[48:53] paragraph 116 of of uh of the revelation
[48:57] of Jesus Christ it's the very last
[48:59] paragraph of the revelation of Jesus
[49:01] Christ if you want to bring it up on the
[49:03] on the screen
[49:05] brother may God Begin by his Spirit if
[49:10] you can find that quote May God Begin by
[49:13] his
[49:14] spirit this would be I think um probably
[49:19] my prayer for this church for the coming
[49:22] year that this this paragraph would be
[49:26] what we actually do who we actually are
[49:31] what we actually encounter because if
[49:34] this doesn't happen then it's all for
[49:37] not we're a denomination we're just
[49:39] gathering together and uh you know
[49:42] there's probably better places better
[49:43] programs and better things that we could
[49:45] do with our time but let's just read
[49:47] this here may God Begin by his Spirit to
[49:50] give us
[49:52] continuous lifegiving and prevailing
[49:55] revelation
[49:56] amen oh if the church could only get a
[50:00] fresh
[50:01] Revelation and become by sorry and by it
[50:07] the Living Word
[50:10] manifested we would do the Greater Works
[50:13] and glorify God our Father in
[50:16] heaven and I wrote a note two words at
[50:20] the end of this in
[50:22] us his desire is for this to happen
[50:25] happen Amen in a bride body brothers and
[50:28] sisters this is not something that's out
[50:31] there in the future don't think of it
[50:33] sometime somewhere somehow it's going to
[50:36] happen to some people maybe in some
[50:38] church this church now today he wants us
[50:42] to have fresh Revelation and it only
[50:45] comes by his spirit and you know what
[50:47] happens when it comes by his Spirit we
[50:50] don't just talk it we live it and once
[50:53] in a while we have a little bit of
[50:55] Fellowship ship about it we can talk
[50:56] about it and we can say Amen to it
[50:58] because it's a fresh Revelation and and
[51:00] we get inspired and we get encouraged by
[51:02] it but we don't have to go and preach it
[51:04] and preach it and preach it all we have
[51:06] to do is live it and by living it people
[51:09] around us become attracted to whatever
[51:11] that life is and and and we have the
[51:13] ability to say you know there's a reason
[51:15] for the Salvation that we have inside of
[51:17] us and that reason is we have a re
[51:20] Revelation about who we are we recognize
[51:22] that we truly are seated in Heavenly
[51:24] places we are Kings and Priests unto God
[51:27] and his father by the Revelation that
[51:29] we've been given amen I just want to
[51:32] pick up we're going to continue to go on
[51:34] with the uh the book here and and I
[51:38] apologize it feels like a lot but I
[51:41] think it's so important that we just
[51:43] need to do it and so we're just going to
[51:45] continue on with it keep plowing
[51:46] forwards and just see if we can't get
[51:49] through this book
[51:50] sometime and uh so where we left off
[51:54] last time was like paragraph 77 of the
[51:57] revelation of Jesus Christ and it says
[52:00] in here see Paul by the Holy Ghost said
[52:02] exactly what Peter said by the Holy
[52:04] Ghost and what was said cannot be
[52:07] changed it has to be the same from
[52:09] Pentecost until the very last elected
[52:12] one has been baptized I personally think
[52:14] that is so incredible it's so good
[52:17] because it just means that nobody's
[52:19] going to be speaking differently we know
[52:20] that Paul said that if an angel from
[52:23] heaven came and spoke any other thing
[52:26] unto you than that which we already have
[52:28] preached and let him be a cursed and he
[52:31] went on to say let me say that again in
[52:33] case you didn't get it if you hear
[52:36] anything different then let them be a
[52:38] cursed whoever would say those words we
[52:40] know that John said don't don't add to
[52:42] it or take one word from it because if
[52:44] you do then the curses in This Book of
[52:46] Revelation they will be upon you so we
[52:49] need to be very cautious about how we
[52:51] actually take and exercise this word but
[52:55] I just think it's beautiful by the Holy
[52:57] Ghost they both preach the same thing
[52:59] and by the Holy Ghost we all will preach
[53:01] the same thing it won't be a different
[53:03] word it can't be a different word if it
[53:05] is a different word that's either lived
[53:08] or spoke then it's a spirit but is it
[53:11] the Holy
[53:13] Spirit we know the next uh part here is
[53:16] Galatians 1:8 it says but though we or
[53:18] an angel from heaven preach any other
[53:20] gospel unto you than that which we have
[53:22] preached unto you let him be ACC cursed
[53:24] for Bram in paragraph 78 he goes on to
[53:27] say now some of you Oneness people
[53:29] baptize wrong you baptize for
[53:31] regeneration as though being immersed in
[53:34] water saved you regeneration does not
[53:37] come by water it is a work of the spirit
[53:40] the man who by the Holy Ghost gave the
[53:42] command repent to be baptized every one
[53:44] of you in the name of the Lord Jesus did
[53:47] not say that water regenerated he said
[53:51] it was only an Evidence of a good
[53:53] conscience toward God that was
[53:57] all 1 Peter
[54:01] 321 like the figure where unto even
[54:04] baptism doth also now save us not
[54:07] putting away the filth of the flesh but
[54:09] the answer of a good conscience toward
[54:11] God by resurrection of Jesus Christ so
[54:15] brothers and sisters when we get that
[54:17] desire to get baptized where's the
[54:18] resurrection of Jesus Christ 2,000 years
[54:21] ago somewhere else nope right here right
[54:25] here it's got to be on the inside
[54:27] brother randam says I believe it if
[54:29] anyone has any false ideas that history
[54:31] can prove water baptism in any other way
[54:33] than the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[54:35] would advise you to read the histories
[54:37] and find out for yourself the following
[54:40] is a true record of baptism which took
[54:41] place in Rome ad. 100 and was reproduced
[54:44] in Time Magazine December 5th
[54:47] 1955 the Deacon raised his hand and
[54:50] pablus Deus stepped through the
[54:52] baptistry door standing waste steep in
[54:54] the pool was Marcus Vasa the wood seller
[54:58] he was smiling as pablus waited into the
[55:00] pool beside him cedus he asked cedo
[55:04] responded pus I believe that my
[55:06] salvation comes from Jesus the Christ
[55:09] who was crucified under Pontius Pilate
[55:11] with him I died that with him I may have
[55:15] eternal life then he felt strong arms
[55:17] supporting him as he let himself fall
[55:18] backward into the pool and heard
[55:20] Marcus's voice in his ear I baptize you
[55:23] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[55:25] as the cold water closed over him right
[55:28] up until the truth was lost and did not
[55:31] return until this last age this is from
[55:35] NAA till the turn of this Century they
[55:38] were baptized in the name of the Lord
[55:40] Jesus Christ but it has come back
[55:43] Hallelujah Satan can't keep the
[55:46] Revelation down when the spirit wants to
[55:49] give it amen isn't that beautiful
[55:51] brothers and sisters he can try all he
[55:54] wants he can get people to make a fuss
[55:56] he can work through whatever Avenue that
[55:58] he can get but he can't stop the
[56:00] Revelation when the spirit wants to give
[56:02] it
[56:05] amen I think it's absolutely beautiful
[56:08] I'm just going to say it again because I
[56:09] know he's listening as well Satan you
[56:11] can't keep the Revelation down when the
[56:13] spirit wants to give it and I just
[56:15] believe it with all my heart brothers
[56:16] and sisters the spirit wants to give us
[56:18] Revelation today more than ever amen
[56:21] otherwise why on Earth are we here
[56:23] what's our purpose is it's not just to
[56:25] be good church people to be message
[56:28] folks to say that we can go to a message
[56:30] church and raise our children in and
[56:32] around the message it's so that we can
[56:34] be the Disciples of Jesus Christ so that
[56:37] we can actually cast out Devils that we
[56:40] can lay our hands on the sick and what
[56:42] will happen they shall recover we could
[56:46] drink any deadly thing and it shall not
[56:48] harm us Mark 16 in action is that church
[56:52] that he wants to reveal himself to and
[56:55] through and all else is
[56:59] false paragraph 83 he says yes if there
[57:03] were three Gods you might very well
[57:05] baptize for a father and a son and a
[57:07] holy
[57:08] ghost but the Revelation given to John
[57:12] was that there is one God and his name
[57:15] is Lord Jesus Christ amen and you
[57:19] baptize for one God and one only one
[57:22] sorry that's why Peter baptized the way
[57:25] he did at Pentecost he had to be true to
[57:28] the Revelation which was let all the
[57:30] house of Israel know assuredly that God
[57:33] hath made the same Jesus whom ye hath
[57:37] Cru crucified both Lord and Christ there
[57:40] he is the Lord Jesus Christ if you
[57:43] recall we talked about it before
[57:45] Christmas and and even the New Year here
[57:48] that the disciples were not deceived the
[57:51] disciples had no deception in them they
[57:53] knew who Jesus was and they knew what
[57:56] his name was am they didn't try and give
[57:59] him another label they knew exactly who
[58:02] he was so when they heard his name they
[58:04] spoke it when they knew they needed to
[58:06] baptize in the name of the Father the
[58:09] name of the son the name of the Holy
[58:10] Ghost they knew it was their friend amen
[58:13] because remember he took them and said
[58:15] to them Brethren I no longer call you
[58:18] servants I call you friends you're no
[58:21] longer going to be not knowing what's
[58:24] going on I'm going to tell you the
[58:25] secrets I'm going to take and give
[58:28] Revelation by the spirit to
[58:31] you 84 if Jesus is both Lord and Christ
[58:37] then he Jesus is and cannot be else but
[58:40] Father Son and Holy Ghost in one person
[58:45] manifest In the Flesh it is not God in
[58:49] three persons Blessed Trinity but one
[58:52] God one person with three major titles
[58:56] with three offices manifesting those
[59:00] titles hear it once more this same Jesus
[59:04] is both Lord and
[59:07] Christ Lord father and Christ Holy
[59:11] Spirit are Jesus for he Jesus is both of
[59:17] both of them Lord in Christ amen if that
[59:21] doesn't show us the true revelation of
[59:23] the godhead nothing will
[59:26] Lord is not another one Christ is not
[59:28] another one this Jesus is the Lord Jesus
[59:33] Christ one God Amen Philip one day said
[59:36] to Jesus Lord show us the father and it
[59:40] will suffice us did you ever step back
[59:42] and think about that scripture how God
[59:45] manifest in flesh must have marveled as
[59:48] he looked at him you've seen so much
[59:51] going on and we know that God isn't
[59:53] surprised but we know that he he must
[59:56] have looked at him and thought my
[59:58] goodness how can we how can I express to
[1:00:01] get through to human beings how can we
[1:00:04] actually condescend so far so that you
[1:00:06] will be able to comprehend that the
[1:00:09] father is in me I I've thought about
[1:00:12] that maybe it's a bit weird but it's
[1:00:14] true we know that God's not surprised I
[1:00:16] know that but just to think about it
[1:00:18] paragraph 85 that doesn't show us the
[1:00:21] true revelation of the God had nothing
[1:00:23] will Lord is is not another one Christ
[1:00:25] is not another one this Jesus is the
[1:00:29] Lord Jesus Christ one God Philip one day
[1:00:31] said to Jesus Lord show us the father
[1:00:33] and it will suffice us Jesus said unto
[1:00:35] him have I been so long with you and you
[1:00:38] don't know me he that has seen me has
[1:00:42] seen the
[1:00:43] father so why do you say show us the
[1:00:46] father I and my father are
[1:00:49] one I think it's so beautiful we've
[1:00:51] heard brother Gilbert Minister on this I
[1:00:54] am and my father are one and you know
[1:00:56] brothers and sisters when that happens
[1:00:59] the world isn't going to have to say are
[1:01:00] you one with your father because the way
[1:01:03] you live your life is going to
[1:01:05] demonstrate that your father and you are
[1:01:07] one and the same thing with the children
[1:01:10] when the children obey their father they
[1:01:13] can say those very words I and my father
[1:01:15] are one because my father says do this
[1:01:18] and I go and do that I'm actually
[1:01:20] becoming one with the father but my
[1:01:24] goodness when a child in front of the
[1:01:26] father says hey okay Daddy I'll do
[1:01:29] whatever you want don't you worry and as
[1:01:30] soon as the father turns his back and
[1:01:32] they're alone doing their own thing they
[1:01:34] just go and do whatever they want are
[1:01:36] they truly one with their
[1:01:37] father
[1:01:40] no I think it's beautiful amen amen I
[1:01:44] and my father are one that's really who
[1:01:45] we are today brothers and sisters
[1:01:47] there's no question about that when we
[1:01:49] have this word in us when we truly get
[1:01:51] the Revelation by the spirit about
[1:01:53] getting the holy ghost in our lives when
[1:01:55] we truly get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[1:01:57] then we truly begin to manifest what
[1:01:59] life whose life are we going to manifest
[1:02:02] it's not going to be some traditional
[1:02:04] thinking it's not going to be what I
[1:02:06] want to do it's not going to be about
[1:02:08] serving me it's going to be about
[1:02:09] serving others because we know eternal
[1:02:11] life is serving for other living for
[1:02:13] others it's not about me and my desires
[1:02:16] and my wishes that's
[1:02:20] right I and my father are one I love
[1:02:23] that I want tow on that for a while
[1:02:26] brother Bram goes on though and he says
[1:02:27] I quoted that once and a lady said just
[1:02:30] a minute Mr Branham you and your wife or
[1:02:32] one I said not that kind she said I beg
[1:02:36] your
[1:02:37] pardon so I said to her do you see me
[1:02:39] she said yes I said do you see my wife
[1:02:42] she said no I said then that Oneness is
[1:02:46] a different kind for he said when you
[1:02:48] see me you see the
[1:02:51] father that's powerful brothers and
[1:02:53] sisters
[1:02:55] amen when you see me you see the Father
[1:02:59] the prophet said that it would be light
[1:03:02] at the evening time in the hymn it's
[1:03:04] written it'll be light in the evening
[1:03:05] time the path to Glory you will surely
[1:03:07] find in the Waterway that's the light
[1:03:10] today buried in the precious name of
[1:03:12] Jesus young and old repent of all your
[1:03:14] sin the Holy Ghost will surely enter in
[1:03:19] the evening light has come it is a fact
[1:03:22] that God and Christ are one
[1:03:25] such a beautiful song he goes on to say
[1:03:28] not too long ago I was talking to a
[1:03:30] Jewish rabbi he said to me you Gentiles
[1:03:33] can't cut God in three pieces and give
[1:03:34] him to a Jew we know better than that I
[1:03:38] said to him that's just it Rabbi we
[1:03:40] don't cut God in three pieces you
[1:03:43] believe the prophets don't you he said
[1:03:46] certainly I do do you believe Isaiah
[1:03:50] 9:6 yes who is the prophet speaking of
[1:03:53] Messiah yeah let's just pause there for
[1:03:56] a second and and just turn there let's
[1:03:58] go to
[1:03:59] Isaiah Isaiah
[1:04:02] 9:6 and just make it fresh so we
[1:04:06] understand who he's talking
[1:04:11] about I said to him that's just it Rabbi
[1:04:14] we don't cut God in three pieces you
[1:04:17] believe the prophets don't you he said
[1:04:19] certainly I do he asked him do you
[1:04:21] believe Isaiah
[1:04:23] 9:6 yes who was the prophet speaking of
[1:04:27] he says Messiah let's read it it says
[1:04:30] For unto us a child is born unto us a
[1:04:33] son is given and the government shall be
[1:04:35] upon his shoulder and his name Shall be
[1:04:37] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[1:04:40] God the Everlasting father the prince of
[1:04:42] peace and I was reading this studying
[1:04:44] this and I was just thinking isn't it
[1:04:46] interesting how that's been taken and
[1:04:48] just made a Christmas story it's just
[1:04:50] been dovetailed with Christmas and
[1:04:52] that's kind of where it's
[1:04:53] compartmentalized and many times that's
[1:04:55] really the only time you hear it spoken
[1:04:57] of but here we have a prophet a
[1:04:59] dispensational prophet a major prophet
[1:05:02] bringing this to the surface to say
[1:05:05] listen there's something to
[1:05:08] this do you believe Isaiah 96 yes who
[1:05:11] was the prophet speaking of Messiah I
[1:05:14] said what Rel relation will Messiah be
[1:05:17] to God he said he will be God I said
[1:05:21] that's right amen you can't put God in
[1:05:23] three persons or three parts you can't
[1:05:28] tell a Jew that there's a father a son a
[1:05:31] holy ghost he'll tell you right quick
[1:05:33] where that idea came from the Jews know
[1:05:36] this Creed was established at the Nan
[1:05:38] Council no wonder they scorn us as
[1:05:42] Heathen we talk about a God that does
[1:05:45] not change the Jews believe that too but
[1:05:49] the church changed its unchanging God
[1:05:52] from one to three
[1:05:55] I just think it's amazing brothers and
[1:05:57] sisters how tricky the devil is isn't it
[1:06:00] because he's taking the scripture and
[1:06:02] using the scripture but just twisting
[1:06:04] the scripture because they're believing
[1:06:06] in Jesus they're believing in the Holy
[1:06:08] Ghost they're believing in God but
[1:06:09] they're taking and making it something
[1:06:11] that it's not and by doing that they're
[1:06:13] making it of none
[1:06:15] effect having a form of godliness but
[1:06:19] because it's only a form of godliness
[1:06:22] they they by virtue deny the power
[1:06:24] thereof and that to me brothers and
[1:06:26] sisters is what I want to encourage us
[1:06:29] to receive is that true power that true
[1:06:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost don't stop at
[1:06:35] church don't stop at quoting quotes
[1:06:37] don't stop at just reading messages or
[1:06:40] just listening to messages get into
[1:06:42] Christ because if you don't get into
[1:06:44] Christ as we heard about last Wednesday
[1:06:46] as we heard about on Sunday you will be
[1:06:49] left in the flood and this flood isn't
[1:06:51] going to be a flood of water it's going
[1:06:53] to be a flood of Fire fire we will wait
[1:06:55] and give our testimony before a white
[1:06:57] Throne of judgment because we refuse to
[1:06:59] accept the word that was given to us in
[1:07:01] the day we got it we took it and made it
[1:07:05] something different than what it truly
[1:07:06] was don't let tradition stand in the way
[1:07:09] don't let Grandma or Grandpa's Ministry
[1:07:12] or teaching of of the message of the
[1:07:14] hour if it's wrong don't let that get in
[1:07:16] the way of the truth for your day don't
[1:07:18] let Mom and Dad's testimony get in the
[1:07:20] way if they're denominational Believers
[1:07:23] God bless them but they're just living
[1:07:24] according to the light for their day
[1:07:26] that they were given blessed are your
[1:07:28] eyes brothers and sisters because you're
[1:07:30] able to see the things of
[1:07:32] God hallelujah and I just can't imagine
[1:07:35] what it would be like one day to just
[1:07:37] live our lives out and believe that
[1:07:40] we're actually serving God and and and
[1:07:42] have certain things in our lives that
[1:07:44] we're just not willing to do the harder
[1:07:46] work to get over and we just drag them
[1:07:48] around one day what we're going to find
[1:07:50] is those things will keep us bound down
[1:07:52] to this earth there will be be a
[1:07:54] resurrection and a Rapture and we will
[1:07:56] think oh my I had that truth it was
[1:07:59] right in my hands and I just let it slip
[1:08:01] right through because I wanted something
[1:08:03] else more than I wanted that we have the
[1:08:06] opportunity brothers and sisters to
[1:08:07] change our lives and you know if this
[1:08:10] message of the hour isn't changing our
[1:08:12] lives then we're not getting the true
[1:08:14] message of the
[1:08:16] hour because it changes us it makes us a
[1:08:19] new creature in Christ
[1:08:22] Jesus
[1:08:27] thank you amen we talk about a God that
[1:08:30] does not
[1:08:31] change paragraph 94 the Jews believe
[1:08:35] that too but the church changed its
[1:08:37] unchanging God from one to
[1:08:41] three but the light is returning at
[1:08:43] evening tide how striking it is that
[1:08:46] this truth has come at a time when the
[1:08:50] Jews are returning to
[1:08:51] Palestine God and Christ are one this is
[1:08:55] both Lord Jesus sorry this Jesus is both
[1:08:59] Lord and
[1:09:01] Christ so we have this being published
[1:09:04] it's being written from like 1960 up to
[1:09:07] 1965 grammar tized and and first it was
[1:09:11] preached in sermons and then it was
[1:09:12] brought together and put together and
[1:09:15] you know brothers and sisters 1965 to
[1:09:19] 2024 now how many years is that that
[1:09:22] that the Jews have been back in
[1:09:24] Palestine and now here we have this
[1:09:26] tremendous conflict going on what's
[1:09:28] Happening is the political parties that
[1:09:31] were completely fractured are actually
[1:09:33] starting to come together as one and you
[1:09:36] know it's not going to be very long
[1:09:37] before there's two witnesses over there
[1:09:39] in that land bringing that 144,000 to
[1:09:43] this message of the hour to this truth
[1:09:45] and what's happening right now while all
[1:09:47] of that is happening brothers and
[1:09:48] sisters is the spirit of Christ is
[1:09:50] lifting off of the Gentiles that's why
[1:09:53] people people don't come to prayer
[1:09:54] meetings because there's no urgency in
[1:09:56] their lives to come together and pray
[1:09:59] that's what's going on brothers and
[1:10:00] sisters if we don't have the desire to
[1:10:02] pray in our homes that's what's going on
[1:10:05] the spirit of this of this of this age
[1:10:08] is lifting off of the Gentiles and going
[1:10:10] back to the to the people in Jerusalem
[1:10:13] there's a reason why we struggle to pray
[1:10:15] there's a reason why we struggle to come
[1:10:17] to church it's because without the Holy
[1:10:19] Ghost in our life there's nothing can
[1:10:21] strain in
[1:10:22] US
[1:10:24] but we have we have a life as we read at
[1:10:28] the very beginning it's the paragraph
[1:10:30] we're going to end on tonight Lord
[1:10:33] willing may God Begin by his Spirit to
[1:10:36] give us continuous lifegiving and
[1:10:38] prevailing
[1:10:39] Revelation oh if the church could only
[1:10:42] get a fresh Revelation and become by it
[1:10:47] the Living Word
[1:10:49] manifested we would do the Greater Works
[1:10:52] and glorify God Our Father in
[1:10:55] Heaven if we could only get it brothers
[1:10:58] and
[1:10:59] sisters he goes on to say if Revelation
[1:11:02] is beyond you look up and seek God for
[1:11:03] it that's the only way you're ever going
[1:11:05] to get it a revelation has to come from
[1:11:09] God it never comes by human natural
[1:11:13] endowments but by spiritual
[1:11:17] enduement I think that's so beautiful
[1:11:20] you know there's nothing that we could
[1:11:21] ever do as human beings and that's why
[1:11:22] I've said it in the past but I just want
[1:11:24] to bring it to the surface again when
[1:11:26] someone is ministering behind the pulpit
[1:11:28] and and we've prayed that by the spirit
[1:11:30] God would come on the scene and minister
[1:11:32] to us that he would do something
[1:11:34] Supernatural in the service and when we
[1:11:36] hear the preaching of the Gospel coming
[1:11:37] to us and we we have something happening
[1:11:40] in our minds Our Minds start to go
[1:11:42] somewhere and we start to have thoughts
[1:11:44] things happen to us and and memories
[1:11:46] come and all these different things
[1:11:48] start to happen brothers and sisters if
[1:11:49] it's according to the word of God it's
[1:11:51] God's spirit moving in your heart
[1:11:55] constraining us to do what he's calling
[1:11:57] us to do now don't don't think for a
[1:12:00] second that I don't I don't have
[1:12:02] experience in my own life some of the
[1:12:04] craziest thoughts that can ever come to
[1:12:06] our minds happen when we're sitting
[1:12:08] right here under the anointing of the
[1:12:11] preaching and that's not God that's the
[1:12:13] devil and all we've got to do is say
[1:12:15] Satan get lost in the name of Jesus
[1:12:18] Christ and sometimes maybe we even have
[1:12:20] to get up and just take a little walk go
[1:12:22] downstairs we got speakers you're not
[1:12:24] going to miss any of the
[1:12:25] service put Satan under your feet
[1:12:27] brothers and sisters get him out of your
[1:12:29] head if he's in your head he's in the
[1:12:31] wrong
[1:12:32] spot
[1:12:35] right a revelation has to come from God
[1:12:38] it never comes by human natural
[1:12:40] endowments but by spiritual
[1:12:42] enduement you can even memorize the
[1:12:45] scripture and though that is wonderful
[1:12:48] that won't do it brother Barry is going
[1:12:50] to say this tonight you can even
[1:12:52] memorize the message
[1:12:54] and though that is wonderful that won't
[1:12:57] do it it has to be a revelation from God
[1:13:01] and when it's a revelation from God
[1:13:03] brothers and sisters your lives will be
[1:13:06] the testimony of it
[1:13:08] am it says in the word that no man can
[1:13:12] say that Jesus is the Christ except by
[1:13:16] the Holy
[1:13:18] Ghost why you have to receive the Holy
[1:13:22] Ghost and then
[1:13:24] and only then can the spirit give you
[1:13:27] the Revelation that Jesus is the Christ
[1:13:31] the anointed one
[1:13:35] amen for many years I thought it was the
[1:13:38] other way around I had to recognize that
[1:13:40] Jesus was the Christ and then
[1:13:42] potentially I could get the Holy Ghost H
[1:13:45] isn't it interesting this dispensational
[1:13:47] Prophet God himself speaking through his
[1:13:50] voice box to man saying the only way
[1:13:53] you're going to get this is by the
[1:13:54] Revelation through the spirit and and
[1:13:58] then you only then you will get it no
[1:14:01] man knows the things of God save the
[1:14:03] spirit of God and He To Whom the spirit
[1:14:06] of God reveals them we need to call on
[1:14:08] God for Revelation more than anything
[1:14:10] else in the world brothers and sisters I
[1:14:13] want to just underline that I want to
[1:14:16] highlight that I want to I want to bold
[1:14:18] italicize whatever we need to do to get
[1:14:21] that there's only one thing that we need
[1:14:23] and that's Revelation by the spirit
[1:14:25] brothers and sisters when that happens
[1:14:27] then everything else will fall into
[1:14:28] place behind us all the signs all the
[1:14:31] Wonders all the things that we desire to
[1:14:33] see in our lives they'll all follow us
[1:14:35] we're not looking to see them out front
[1:14:37] if we are then maybe we're looking at
[1:14:39] the wrong thing we need to call on God
[1:14:43] for Revelation more than anything else
[1:14:45] in the
[1:14:46] world I just want to say this brothers
[1:14:48] and sisters just because we can say that
[1:14:50] God sent a prophet doesn't mean we have
[1:14:52] revelation am just because we can quote
[1:14:55] quotes doesn't mean that we've got
[1:14:57] Revelation just because we can come to
[1:14:59] church doesn't mean we have Revelation
[1:15:03] it's going to be a manifested life that
[1:15:05] will demonstrate we've got
[1:15:08] [Music]
[1:15:12] revelation we have accepted the Bible we
[1:15:14] have accepted the great truths of it but
[1:15:17] it still is not real to most people
[1:15:20] because the Revelation by the spirit is
[1:15:23] not
[1:15:24] there the word has not been
[1:15:31] quickened what happens to us when we
[1:15:33] become a new creature in Christ
[1:15:36] Jesus when that word has become
[1:15:38] quickened we become humble amen and
[1:15:42] we're willing to Humble ourselves Amen
[1:15:46] in the sight of the Lord and as we heard
[1:15:48] about on Sunday that's not coming to
[1:15:51] church and kneeling down at the pulpit
[1:15:53] it maybe it is to some extent but you
[1:15:56] know if we go and live our lives the
[1:15:57] rest of the week proud
[1:16:00] boastful knowing all the quotes talking
[1:16:03] about other people slandering other
[1:16:06] people gossiping about other people and
[1:16:09] then coming to church on Sunday because
[1:16:10] i' I'm revelated man I've got the spirit
[1:16:13] right right that's exactly what the
[1:16:15] devil
[1:16:17] wants exactly that's a religious spirit
[1:16:20] brothers and sisters don't have a
[1:16:22] religious spirit have the Holy Spirit
[1:16:24] get to Jesus Christ and all of that
[1:16:27] rubbish will go out of our lives and we
[1:16:30] won't have any room for
[1:16:32] sin you know brother bradam talks about
[1:16:34] it and I just believe it with all my
[1:16:36] heart if we believe that there is a
[1:16:38] living God if we believe this message of
[1:16:40] the hour to be true brothers and sisters
[1:16:42] we should be able to see the power of
[1:16:44] God manifest in our lives such a way
[1:16:47] that not one evil spirit could walk
[1:16:49] through that door and be able to stand
[1:16:51] it that evil spirit would have to to run
[1:16:54] away and I want to go even further with
[1:16:56] it it should be the same thing in our
[1:16:59] lives but if we've got this and we've
[1:17:02] got that and we've got the other thing
[1:17:04] all these things that are just there
[1:17:05] little things they're little devil
[1:17:07] tentacles in our lives if we're not
[1:17:09] willing to cut them off we're going to
[1:17:11] give Satan access we heard it so good I
[1:17:14] believe it was God speaking through
[1:17:15] brother brother Emmanuel was it last
[1:17:18] Wednesday everything that we don't
[1:17:20] surrender unto God in our lives
[1:17:22] everything that we don't give unto God
[1:17:24] in our lives we just give it to the
[1:17:25] devil brothers and sisters and it might
[1:17:27] seem normal but remember
[1:17:30] remember even though all things are
[1:17:32] lawful they're not
[1:17:34] expedient am is it going to help you
[1:17:37] with your spiritual Revelation think
[1:17:39] about it before you do it before you
[1:17:42] look at it before you go there whatever
[1:17:44] it is we do is it going to increase our
[1:17:47] ability for Spiritual Revelation or is
[1:17:49] it going to hinder it amen cuz if it's
[1:17:52] going to hinder it and we're Believers
[1:17:53] of this message why would we do it why
[1:17:55] would we want
[1:17:57] it we got to Humble ourselves in the
[1:18:00] sight of the Lord and then he'll Lift us
[1:18:01] up and that humbling ourselves in the
[1:18:03] sight of the Lord I want to say it
[1:18:05] clearly is one to
[1:18:07] another he doesn't have eyes brothers
[1:18:09] and sisters he's using your eyes he
[1:18:12] doesn't have ears he's using your ears
[1:18:14] he doesn't have mouths he's using your
[1:18:16] mouth that's why there's a five-fold
[1:18:17] Ministry for the perfecting of the
[1:18:19] Saints amen but if we can't humble
[1:18:21] ourselves to our brothers to our
[1:18:24] sisters how are we ever going to be
[1:18:26] raised up by God he's going to say you
[1:18:29] got a religious spirit I can't deal with
[1:18:32] you you got to get right but boy oh boy
[1:18:35] when we get that looked after watch out
[1:18:38] Satan will be powerless before
[1:18:41] you that's what we're talking about here
[1:18:43] this might seem real hard brothers and
[1:18:45] sisters but this is where we're going
[1:18:47] this we're heading into 24 we're in 24
[1:18:50] there's no time to play church if if
[1:18:53] you're doing that you're going in the
[1:18:54] and you're not going to hit the Rapture
[1:18:56] that's all you'll just stay that's
[1:18:58] what'll happen it'll be the white Throne
[1:19:00] judgment and hopefully there will be
[1:19:02] something you did in your life that you
[1:19:03] can say you know I did this Lord because
[1:19:06] going into that the white Throne
[1:19:07] judgment as someone who knew the message
[1:19:10] of the hour who knew that God sent a
[1:19:12] prophet but just didn't follow his
[1:19:14] instructions I what will that be like
[1:19:18] I'll say it this time I told the story
[1:19:20] before but there was a time where I got
[1:19:22] a ticket for something an infraction in
[1:19:24] my car and I wound up going to court for
[1:19:26] it and I listened to my friend my friend
[1:19:27] said oh yeah you can just do this don't
[1:19:29] worry about it you can go and and and do
[1:19:31] it and it won't be a problem and what it
[1:19:32] was was buy a car put a ra uh another
[1:19:34] license plate on the car and just drive
[1:19:37] it you can drive it from the place you
[1:19:38] purchased it to your home and you're
[1:19:40] covered you have insurance and
[1:19:41] registration everything is fine you can
[1:19:42] only do it one time and it's all good so
[1:19:44] I took his advice bought the car put my
[1:19:46] PL on got pulled over police said no
[1:19:48] where's your insurance where's your
[1:19:50] registration this is for another car you
[1:19:52] you know this is isn't right and I'm
[1:19:53] like well but my friend he's like yeah
[1:19:55] whatever and it wasn't actually a ticket
[1:19:58] of fine it was a summons to go before a
[1:20:00] judge so to go before the judge and so
[1:20:02] of course I go and I've got my my friend
[1:20:05] told me man I'm going to go and tell
[1:20:06] that to the judge and and I dress up and
[1:20:09] I go into the courtroom and I sit there
[1:20:11] and I wait and and and it's just God he
[1:20:14] knows how to deal with us doesn't he I
[1:20:16] wasn't a Believer I wasn't living my
[1:20:17] life for God at the time but I wound up
[1:20:19] sitting at the back which was my common
[1:20:21] place in any situation like that and
[1:20:24] what happened was I got to watch
[1:20:25] everyone else in the courtroom go
[1:20:27] through go through go through and many
[1:20:29] people they had friends and they had
[1:20:31] ideas and they had their instructions
[1:20:33] and they said but but but and the court
[1:20:35] the judge said but did you have
[1:20:37] insurance or not yes or no one answer
[1:20:40] one word and they'd have to say no and
[1:20:42] he'd say Okay
[1:20:43] guilty next and it was like that and I
[1:20:46] got to watch 75 people go in front of me
[1:20:48] and I thought oh Lord have mercy I'm not
[1:20:50] going to be able to say anything so I
[1:20:52] just went up and I said no your honor I
[1:20:54] didn't have insurance and he said okay
[1:20:55] guilty boom easy let's go for lunch but
[1:20:59] you know brothers and sisters one day to
[1:21:01] know this message of the hour to think
[1:21:03] that I can take Daddy's instruction or
[1:21:05] mommy's instruction or anybody's
[1:21:07] instruction and think that I'm going to
[1:21:09] get by with it you're not going to
[1:21:10] you've got to get Revelation by the
[1:21:12] spirit
[1:21:13] yourself and then you'll be able to be
[1:21:16] in that Throne you won't be standing
[1:21:18] before
[1:21:19] it we don't want to see we don't want to
[1:21:22] feel like fools thinking I had it
[1:21:26] myl it was right there and you know the
[1:21:30] worst thing we're probably going to get
[1:21:31] into it on Sunday is the worst thing is
[1:21:34] we take our families with
[1:21:36] us who would want to do that to our
[1:21:39] families no we would want to lay our
[1:21:41] lives down maybe for our children and
[1:21:43] our our spouses but goodness sakes don't
[1:21:45] don't don't don't take our families that
[1:21:47] way no way we want to know that we know
[1:21:50] we heard about it on Sunday when we put
[1:21:52] that that token on the lentil and the
[1:21:55] doorposts of Our Lives we want to know
[1:21:58] because that Death Angel is passing
[1:21:59] through the land brothers and
[1:22:01] sisters and he's not going to spare he's
[1:22:03] not going to have mercy he's going to
[1:22:04] take your children and rip them right
[1:22:05] out from under you and take them right
[1:22:07] out into the world that's going to be
[1:22:08] the outcome of our misbehavior as
[1:22:10] parents if we want to continue
[1:22:11] misbehaving that's what's going to
[1:22:13] happen and you know what unless
[1:22:15] something Supernatural happens in our
[1:22:17] lives there's no way that we could ever
[1:22:19] take our children and prevent them from
[1:22:21] actually being tempted of the devil I
[1:22:23] don't know what the quote is exactly but
[1:22:24] brother Bram says it if you don't have
[1:22:26] it straightened out in your home rock
[1:22:28] and roll is going to get your children
[1:22:31] music will get your children and would
[1:22:33] we want to sacrifice our children you
[1:22:36] know in the in the in the in the days of
[1:22:38] the children of Israel they got tied up
[1:22:40] with the people in the land we were
[1:22:41] talking about this over Christmas do we
[1:22:43] know what the idol Molech was the god
[1:22:47] Molech yeah they passed their seed
[1:22:49] through the fire the the parents
[1:22:51] literally took their children and put
[1:22:53] them on the idol and the Idol's hands
[1:22:56] were like this and the baby rolled down
[1:22:59] the hands Into the Fire as a Living
[1:23:02] Sacrifice to the God
[1:23:05] mik you know that's physical brothers
[1:23:08] and sisters without having the token
[1:23:10] properly placed in our homes we're doing
[1:23:13] the exact same thing
[1:23:14] spiritually P our children unto the unto
[1:23:17] the God of this world the God of this
[1:23:19] evil age how many different gods are
[1:23:21] there we need to make sure brothers and
[1:23:24] sisters
[1:23:27] amen we have accepted the Bible we have
[1:23:29] accepted the great truths of it but
[1:23:31] still it's not real to most people
[1:23:33] because the Revelation by the spirit is
[1:23:36] not there the word has not been
[1:23:40] quickened brothers and sisters pray that
[1:23:43] the spirit would Quicken that word amen
[1:23:46] the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:21
[1:23:49] that we have become the righteousness of
[1:23:51] God by our Union with Jesus Christ did
[1:23:54] you get it it says that we are the very
[1:23:57] righteousness of God himself by being in
[1:24:00] Christ it says that he Jesus became sin
[1:24:03] for us it does not say he became sinful
[1:24:06] but he became sin for us that by our
[1:24:09] Union with him we might become the
[1:24:11] righteousness of God I think that's so
[1:24:14] beautiful and as I was studying this I
[1:24:16] just couldn't help but think you know
[1:24:17] sometimes we talk about the invisible
[1:24:19] Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:24:24] and though we have the invisible Union
[1:24:25] of the Bride of Jesus Christ and and the
[1:24:28] Heavenly bridegroom you know what
[1:24:30] happens brothers and sisters it's not an
[1:24:32] invisible Union to you it's not an
[1:24:35] invisible Union to your family it's
[1:24:38] quite visible that you have a union with
[1:24:40] your heavenly father because you live
[1:24:42] your life differently you don't do the
[1:24:44] things that you used to do you don't
[1:24:46] have the same desires that you used to
[1:24:48] have you don't go to the same places you
[1:24:50] don't look at the same things you don't
[1:24:51] listen to the the same stuff you have a
[1:24:53] desire to serve God you want more
[1:24:56] Revelation by the spirit in your life
[1:24:59] the more you get the more you
[1:25:01] want but it's not an invisible Union it
[1:25:04] is to the world brothers and sisters not
[1:25:06] to your brothers and sisters not to your
[1:25:08] parents not to your children not to your
[1:25:11] spouses it's not an invisible Union to
[1:25:15] the world it is paragraph 100 if we
[1:25:18] accept the fact and we must that he
[1:25:20] literally became sin for us by his
[1:25:22] substitution for us then we must also
[1:25:25] accept the fact that we by our Union
[1:25:27] with him have become the very
[1:25:30] righteousness of
[1:25:32] God why that is powerful brothers and
[1:25:35] sisters with you having the revelation
[1:25:38] of Jesus Christ Quicken the word Quicken
[1:25:40] by the spirit you have become the very
[1:25:43] righteousness of God this is God
[1:25:45] speaking to this generation through a
[1:25:47] prophet to you to reject one is to
[1:25:50] reject the other to accept the one is to
[1:25:54] accept the other now we know the Bible
[1:25:56] says that it can't be denied but the
[1:25:59] revelation of it is
[1:26:03] missing how many of us feel like
[1:26:05] the how many of us actually feel like we
[1:26:09] are the very righteousness of
[1:26:11] God and that's where we go back a little
[1:26:13] ways don't rely on your senses because
[1:26:16] your senses will lie because if your
[1:26:18] senses say that you are not the
[1:26:19] righteousness of God then what are they
[1:26:20] saying to you they're lying and that's
[1:26:22] the devil's domain he's going to play in
[1:26:24] his playground of our senses all day
[1:26:27] long he'll be on those monkey bars going
[1:26:29] from one to the other swinging back and
[1:26:30] forth going back and forth on the swing
[1:26:32] going la la la la la but boy oh boy when
[1:26:35] we can actually recognize that by the
[1:26:37] Spirit quickening by the spirit and put
[1:26:40] the run on the devil he'll have no power
[1:26:41] over us brothers and sisters that
[1:26:43] Revelation won't be missing in our lives
[1:26:45] it won't be avoid spot in our lives
[1:26:47] we'll know who we are and where we stand
[1:26:50] brother brandham says it's not real to
[1:26:52] the majority of God's children and this
[1:26:56] is where I want to step in and say this
[1:26:58] is going to be the difference between
[1:26:59] the very
[1:27:00] elected and the foolish virgin between
[1:27:04] the wise and the unwise Virgin they're
[1:27:06] both virgin brother bradam says here God
[1:27:08] says through him that they're both
[1:27:10] children they're both God's children
[1:27:11] it's not real to the majority of God's
[1:27:13] children it is just a good verse in the
[1:27:16] Bible and I want to say this don't let
[1:27:18] it just be a good quote in the message
[1:27:20] or a good verse in the Bible
[1:27:22] he says but we need to have it made
[1:27:24] alive to us that will take Revelation
[1:27:29] it's got to be the revelation of Jesus
[1:27:31] Christ man I just love this this gets me
[1:27:33] so excited paragraph 101 let me drop in
[1:27:37] something here that will both amaze and
[1:27:38] help you there was hardly a student that
[1:27:40] does not believe that all the New
[1:27:42] Testament was originally in the Greek
[1:27:44] language all our great Bible students
[1:27:46] have said that God gave the world three
[1:27:48] great nations with three great
[1:27:50] contributions for the sake sake of the
[1:27:52] Gospel he gave the Greeks who gave
[1:27:55] universal language he gave us the Jews
[1:27:57] who gave us True Religion and true
[1:27:59] knowledge of God through the savior he
[1:28:01] gave us the Romans who gave us a unified
[1:28:03] empire with law and a system of
[1:28:06] Highways thus we have True Religion the
[1:28:10] language to express it to many peoples
[1:28:12] and the government and Roads to spread
[1:28:14] it physically and historically speaking
[1:28:17] this seems to be exactly right isn't it
[1:28:19] beautiful that God would not just leave
[1:28:21] it out to pasture he would make sure
[1:28:23] these things are in place and I want to
[1:28:25] say it this way he's allowed anointings
[1:28:27] to hit the Earth at very specific times
[1:28:30] such as the magnetic recording device
[1:28:32] where did that come from why was it here
[1:28:33] why did it just happen just appeared why
[1:28:36] did we just discover electricity why did
[1:28:38] we discover the light bulb how did we
[1:28:40] ever get the phone let alone the cell
[1:28:42] phone or the computer how did all of
[1:28:44] this information actually hit the earth
[1:28:47] is because God allowed it to happen for
[1:28:49] a very specific purpose and it's
[1:28:50] interesting because I would would
[1:28:52] personally say I didn't believe it when
[1:28:53] I first heard it I was like man you're
[1:28:55] crazy I think I heard brother Tim DOD
[1:28:57] say it I thought this guy's a lunatic
[1:28:59] but what he said was the magnetic
[1:29:01] recording device was given to Earth so
[1:29:03] that this voice of a Vindicated Prophet
[1:29:05] could be retained because it wasn't the
[1:29:07] voice of a Prophet this was the voice of
[1:29:09] God speaking through a prophet and all
[1:29:12] the rest of it's a perversion brothers
[1:29:14] and sisters and look at where it's gone
[1:29:15] with music and videos oh television
[1:29:19] movies all of it it's all perversion
[1:29:22] from one thing just so that we could
[1:29:24] hear the voice of a Vindicated Prophet
[1:29:27] express the thoughts of God to this age
[1:29:29] my
[1:29:30] goodness I can see we're not going to
[1:29:32] finish this
[1:29:36] part it's beautiful I love it paragraph
[1:29:39] 102 and today our Greek Scholars say
[1:29:41] that the Greek language of Bible days is
[1:29:43] so perfect and exact that if the student
[1:29:46] of the Greek is a refined and accurate
[1:29:48] grammarian he can truly know exactly
[1:29:51] what the new test word teaches but is
[1:29:54] this not only a theory is it is this
[1:29:58] true is it not so that every Greek
[1:30:01] scholar of repute from one denomination
[1:30:03] debates another student of another
[1:30:05] denomination and is it not so that their
[1:30:08] arguments are based on identical Greek
[1:30:11] words and identical rules of grammar
[1:30:13] certainly that is the way it is and I
[1:30:16] want to say this isn't it interesting
[1:30:17] that we can look at that and say we
[1:30:19] could we could just take away from that
[1:30:22] and say you know we have the theologians
[1:30:24] in the message that would say they can
[1:30:27] argue a thought they can take a quote
[1:30:29] and and make it say what they wanted to
[1:30:31] say and then someone else who is a
[1:30:32] message Theologian could take their
[1:30:34] quote out and say but it says this also
[1:30:36] and then they could go back and the
[1:30:37] other one could say but I have this and
[1:30:39] the other one could say but I have that
[1:30:42] and what what a ridiculous thing it is
[1:30:44] isn't it why not just say God bless you
[1:30:46] and let the spirit lead why not get
[1:30:49] Spirit by Revelation by the spirit and
[1:30:51] just let the spirit of Jesus Christ lead
[1:30:53] us and guide us into all truth am but
[1:30:56] here we have it talking about the the
[1:30:59] the the the
[1:31:02] denominational
[1:31:03] gramians paragraph 103 even back there
[1:31:07] in the pergan age just prior to the
[1:31:08] nyine Council of 325 there were two
[1:31:11] great students Aras and a
[1:31:14] aanus who became locked in a doctrinal
[1:31:17] combat over a Greek word so intense and
[1:31:20] so worldwide did their debate become
[1:31:23] that the historians said the world was
[1:31:25] divided over a dip thong the sound of
[1:31:29] two vowels in a single
[1:31:33] syllable you know you've heard the
[1:31:34] statement the devil's in the details if
[1:31:37] you're getting into the details that far
[1:31:39] then it's not
[1:31:40] Christ because simply put he either died
[1:31:44] for you as a sinner and rose again or he
[1:31:47] didn't and that's the only thing that
[1:31:49] counts trying to say that you know know
[1:31:52] more or he knows less is is is an
[1:31:55] exercise in wasting time it's just a
[1:31:58] distraction by the devil paragraph 104
[1:32:00] now if the Greek is so perfect and so
[1:32:02] ordained of God why was there such a
[1:32:04] dispute surely God did not intend for us
[1:32:06] all to know Greek right today we're
[1:32:09] having arguments over the Greek take for
[1:32:12] instance the book Christ paralyzed
[1:32:14] Church x-rayed by Dr mcen in it he sets
[1:32:18] forth numerous quotes from many renowned
[1:32:20] Greek grammarians and proves to his own
[1:32:23] satisfaction that the unchanging rules
[1:32:25] of Greek grammar prove conclusively that
[1:32:27] the Bible teaches a man baptized with
[1:32:30] the Holy Ghost
[1:32:31] subse sorry the Bible teaches a man is
[1:32:35] baptized with the Holy Ghost subsequent
[1:32:37] to rebirth he also states flatly that
[1:32:40] women can take over the pulpit because
[1:32:42] the word prophesy means to preach but
[1:32:45] has he conceived convinced sorry other
[1:32:48] students of the Greek who are as able as
[1:32:51] he never all you have to do is read
[1:32:54] those quotes read
[1:32:56] those all you have to do is read those
[1:32:59] students who hold the opposite View and
[1:33:01] hear their learned
[1:33:05] quotes we're getting
[1:33:07] there I'd really like to finish this
[1:33:09] part if we can now not only is what I
[1:33:13] have just said true but let us go on a
[1:33:15] step further today we have some students
[1:33:17] who claim that the original manuscripts
[1:33:19] were written in aric which was the
[1:33:22] language of Jesus and the people of his
[1:33:23] day it is claimed by them that the
[1:33:26] people did not speak and write in the
[1:33:29] Greek as it is so commonly supposed and
[1:33:32] the fact is our historians are divided
[1:33:35] on that for example Dr shanfield a most
[1:33:39] brilliant student has from research
[1:33:42] proved to his satisfaction that the New
[1:33:44] Testament was written in the vernacular
[1:33:47] of the greek-speaking people of that day
[1:33:49] he builds up a fine case for his beliefs
[1:33:52] based on the various documents at his
[1:33:54] disposal but on the other hand we have
[1:33:57] another renowned student Dr lamza Who is
[1:34:00] convinced that the New Testament was
[1:34:02] written in the Aramaic and he has none
[1:34:06] other than the brilliant historian tabbi
[1:34:10] to back up his contention that the
[1:34:12] Aramaic and not the Greek was the
[1:34:14] language of the people so it seems
[1:34:17] possible that the New Testament was
[1:34:19] first written in the Aramaic
[1:34:22] however before we get too concerned
[1:34:24] about this let us read both the King
[1:34:26] James version and the translation by Dr
[1:34:30] lamza to our gratification we find the
[1:34:33] words in both amazingly the same so that
[1:34:36] there is no difference actually in
[1:34:39] content or doctrine I just want to go
[1:34:41] back to the statement that we read
[1:34:43] earlier isn't it interesting that even
[1:34:45] here in in brother bram's day we would
[1:34:48] be able to have that comparison that
[1:34:50] Paul and Peter are preaching the same
[1:34:53] thing they're not changing the word the
[1:34:55] word is not being changed brother Brown
[1:34:58] goes on to say paragraph 110 that we may
[1:35:00] even conclude that God has allowed these
[1:35:02] newly discovered manuscripts and recent
[1:35:04] publications of already known scripts to
[1:35:06] become to come before us to prove the
[1:35:10] authenticity of what we already had and
[1:35:13] we find that through
[1:35:15] translators though translators May fight
[1:35:18] each other the scripts do not now you
[1:35:21] can see that you can't base
[1:35:22] interpretation upon students profound
[1:35:25] knowledge of the language the Bible is
[1:35:28] written in but if you still can't see
[1:35:31] that because you are veiled in your mind
[1:35:33] by tradition here's one last
[1:35:36] illustration I'm just going to say this
[1:35:38] this way now you can't see now you can
[1:35:40] see you can't base interpretation upon
[1:35:43] students profound knowledge of the
[1:35:46] language of the message is written in
[1:35:49] but if you still can't see that because
[1:35:50] you are failed in your mind by tradition
[1:35:53] here is one last illustration no one can
[1:35:57] doubt but what the scribes and Pharisees
[1:36:00] and the great Scholars of the Year 33 ad
[1:36:03] knew the exact laws of grammar and the
[1:36:05] exact meanings of the words in which the
[1:36:07] Old Testament was written remember it's
[1:36:11] said that they could take a scroll which
[1:36:14] was the word of God and roll it up and
[1:36:16] they could actually take a pin insert it
[1:36:19] through it and tell you exactly what
[1:36:21] scripture verse they have pierced
[1:36:24] through with that needle when they open
[1:36:26] up and read it and be accurate with that
[1:36:28] brothers and sisters they knew the word
[1:36:31] of God for their day brother ban I'm
[1:36:33] here saying no one can doubt but what
[1:36:36] the scribes and Pharisees and the great
[1:36:37] Scholars of the Year 33 ad knew the
[1:36:40] exact laws of grammar and the exact
[1:36:41] meanings of the words in which the Old
[1:36:43] Testament was written but for all their
[1:36:46] superb
[1:36:47] knowledge they missed the revelation of
[1:36:51] God God's promised word manifested in
[1:36:54] the Sun and I want to say it brothers
[1:36:56] and sisters if we don't have Revelation
[1:36:57] by the spirit in our lives we are going
[1:37:00] to miss what's actually taking place in
[1:37:03] our
[1:37:04] day right he says there he was set forth
[1:37:08] from Genesis to Malachi with whole
[1:37:11] chapters devoted to him and his ministry
[1:37:13] and yet except for a few who were
[1:37:16] eliminated by the spirit they missed him
[1:37:19] entirely now we come to a conclusion
[1:37:22] such conclusion as we have already found
[1:37:25] in the
[1:37:26] word as much as we have as we believe in
[1:37:30] trying to find the oldest and best
[1:37:32] manuscripts to get the best record of
[1:37:34] the word possible we will never get the
[1:37:38] true meaning of it by study and
[1:37:41] comparison of scriptures sincere as we
[1:37:45] may be brother Barry speaking here we
[1:37:48] can be sincere brother brothers and
[1:37:51] sisters but we can be sincerely
[1:37:54] wrong we can be sincere but sincerely
[1:37:58] wrong there's only one way we're going
[1:38:00] to be right and that's by the word and
[1:38:03] the word for our day and we have got to
[1:38:05] make sure that we're living Our Lives
[1:38:07] according to that word and you know what
[1:38:09] if we're not it's not too late just
[1:38:13] change and if you can't change ask God
[1:38:15] to help change you and I promise you he
[1:38:20] will he says it will take a revelation
[1:38:23] from God to bring it out that's exactly
[1:38:26] what Paul said 1 Corinthians 2:13 which
[1:38:29] things we also speak not in words by
[1:38:32] man's Wisdom teacheth but by but with
[1:38:35] the Holy Ghost
[1:38:37] teacheth the true revelation of God the
[1:38:40] true Revelation is God interpreting his
[1:38:43] own word by vindicating what is
[1:38:47] Promised isn't that beautiful I'll call
[1:38:49] the musicians as we close
[1:38:52] the true revelation of God is God
[1:38:54] interpreting his own word by vindicating
[1:38:58] what is promised and what is Promised
[1:39:00] brothers and sisters that you will
[1:39:01] become a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:39:03] amen what's promised that he will send
[1:39:06] you you Malachi 4 before the great and
[1:39:11] Dreadful day of the Lord and you know
[1:39:14] when we receive a prophet in the name of
[1:39:17] a prophet we receive the prophet's
[1:39:19] reward and we can think about all the
[1:39:21] different things that the prophet's
[1:39:23] going to get as a reward and all the
[1:39:24] different things that we would like to
[1:39:26] see as a reward but remember what's the
[1:39:28] greatest miracle that that Prophet said
[1:39:30] that he taught in his life that we could
[1:39:32] become a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:39:35] that we could go from being a sinner and
[1:39:37] become a saint that we could recognize
[1:39:40] that part of what we read in the word
[1:39:41] tonight I would say the word excuse me
[1:39:44] but in this book that we're reading that
[1:39:46] that portion of it that said you are the
[1:39:49] very righteousness of God
[1:39:53] the greatest miracle that could ever
[1:39:55] happen isn't getting getting things in
[1:39:58] our lives it's not getting healed it's
[1:39:59] not seeing tremendous signs and wonders
[1:40:02] it's that a man could become a new
[1:40:04] creature in Christ Jesus recognize that
[1:40:07] he actually died and rose again for me
[1:40:11] personally brother the brandom goes on
[1:40:13] to say now don't let anyone be misled by
[1:40:16] what I have said and think that I do not
[1:40:19] believe in the accuracy of the word as
[1:40:22] we now have it I believe this Bible is
[1:40:26] accurate Jesus completely authenticated
[1:40:29] the Old Testament when here on Earth and
[1:40:32] it was compiled
[1:40:34] exactly as was our new testament make no
[1:40:37] mistake about it we have the infallible
[1:40:39] word of God today and no man dares take
[1:40:42] from it or add to it but we need the
[1:40:45] same spirit that gave it to teach it to
[1:40:48] us maybe stand with me as we
[1:40:52] close remember Phillip he was preaching
[1:40:55] and the spirit sent him out into the
[1:40:58] desert told him you need to go and do
[1:41:01] something I got something for you to do
[1:41:03] and he found a
[1:41:05] unic remember the unic was there and and
[1:41:08] he came upon him and he said hey buddy
[1:41:09] what's up what are you doing he said I'm
[1:41:11] reading the scripture and he said how
[1:41:14] can I understand it though unless
[1:41:16] someone teaches me right God uses people
[1:41:21] but what the people say has to line up
[1:41:24] with the
[1:41:25] word it can't be different brothers and
[1:41:29] sisters paragraph 115 oh how we need
[1:41:32] Revelation by the spirit we don't need a
[1:41:35] new Bible we don't need a new
[1:41:38] translation though some are very good
[1:41:41] and I'm not against them but we need the
[1:41:44] revelation of the spirit and thank God
[1:41:48] we can have what we need for God wants
[1:41:51] to reveal his word to us by his Spirit
[1:41:56] isn't that beautiful he wants to
[1:41:57] brothers and sisters he doesn't want to
[1:41:59] leave us out in the wilderness he wants
[1:42:01] us to get it and I believe that's why
[1:42:03] we're all gathered here because he wants
[1:42:05] us to be quickened by his
[1:42:09] word we know that word Quicken means
[1:42:12] alive we're going to get eternal life by
[1:42:15] his word the Revelation by the spirit is
[1:42:17] going to change us we're not going to be
[1:42:19] the same people tomorrow that we are
[1:42:22] today we're not today who we were
[1:42:24] yesterday or or 5 days ago or five years
[1:42:27] ago and if you are the same brothers and
[1:42:30] sisters I want to encourage you to get
[1:42:33] going because you're not doing any good
[1:42:35] if you're the same we've got to be
[1:42:37] moving we've got to be growing God
[1:42:39] created this universe to be either
[1:42:41] moving or stopped you're either growing
[1:42:44] and living or you're dying
[1:42:47] true as we close tonight May may God
[1:42:51] Begin by his Spirit to give us
[1:42:53] continuous lifegiving and prevailing
[1:42:56] Revelation amen oh if the church could
[1:42:59] only get a fresh Revelation and become
[1:43:02] by it the Living Word manifested he
[1:43:06] would do the Greater Works and glorify
[1:43:09] God our Father in Heaven amen let's just
[1:43:12] bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord
[1:43:15] tonight I believe that every one of us
[1:43:17] desires that you would reveal yourself
[1:43:20] to us and through US Lord father that we
[1:43:23] would get that Revelation by your spirit
[1:43:25] that we read about tonight that we
[1:43:27] wouldn't just be poking at it and
[1:43:29] thinking about it and talking about it
[1:43:30] but Lord Jesus that we would just go on
[1:43:32] our knees and lay ourselves open unto
[1:43:34] you father and say just Quicken it in my
[1:43:37] spirit Lord Jesus make me a new creature

[1:43:52] your spirit that I would be a new
[1:43:54] creature in Christ Jesus father let us
[1:43:57] be the living manifestation of your word
[1:44:00] that this church father would be the
[1:44:02] Living Word it wouldn't just be a a name
[1:44:04] on a sign somewhere we wouldn't just use
[1:44:07] it as an affiliation word but Lord that
[1:44:09] our lives would truly be living out your
[1:44:12] word amen father we just ask that you
