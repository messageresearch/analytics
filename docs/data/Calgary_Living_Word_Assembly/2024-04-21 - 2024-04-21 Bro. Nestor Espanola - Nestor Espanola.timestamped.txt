[33:49] simple and that the ministering of
[33:52] perfection is just the administering of
[33:55] Grace and we just have to accept it
[33:58] so this poem is called the child of
[34:00] Grace brother Paul you keep saying the
[34:03] word declaration let start in the
[34:06] Declaration of Immaculate
[34:08] selection God's Royal hand picked me I
[34:12] pray you can put yourself in there today
[34:15] a vessel for his
[34:17] Reflection by his grace I am set free
[34:21] not by my own Merit or
[34:23] might but by his unfailing decree he
[34:27] called me out of the night to know his
[34:30] love
[34:32] eternally a privilege beyond measure to
[34:35] be called the child of his grace in his
[34:38] arms I find my pleasure in his presence

[34:43] embraced entitled to his Revelation to
[34:47] know him

[56:06] what she
[56:08] is praise God he says

[56:21] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[56:25] amen for for without me you can do
[56:30] nothing then we read another verse in
[56:33] Revelation chapter 10: 7 to
[56:38] 11 but in the days of the voice of the
[56:41] seventh
[56:42] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[56:46] mystery of God should be finished that
[56:48] he had declared to his servant the
[56:50] prophets and the voice which I heard
[56:53] from Heaven spake unto me again and said
[56:56] go go and take the little book which is
[56:58] open in the hand of the Angel which
[57:01] standed upon the sea and upon the Earth
[57:04] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[57:08] him give me the little
[57:10] book and he said unto me take it and eat
[57:14] it and it shall make thy belly bitter
[57:17] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[57:21] honey
[57:22] then and I took the little book out of
[57:26] the Angel's hand and ate it up and it
[57:29] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[57:31] soon as I have eaten it my belly was
[57:36] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[57:40] prophesy again before many peoples
[57:44] nation and
[57:45] tongues and Kings may the Lord add the
[57:48] blessing from the reading of this
[57:50] scripture you all may be seated praise
[57:53] God hallelujah
[57:59] it's always good to be in the house of
[58:01] the
[58:01] Lord I Thank your pastor Pastor Berry to
[58:04] allowing me to stand behind this
[58:08] ppit it's not easy to stand behind some
[58:11] other some others
[58:13] Pulpit praise God like the prophet said
[58:16] the apostles is the most suspicious
[58:17] person on the
[58:19] earth see because uh they want to
[58:22] protect the fla okay so and that's the
[58:25] best
[58:26] best thing you know the pastor need to
[58:29] protect his flock praise God hallelujah
[58:33] see so this morning I want to speak
[58:35] about uh uh we are the branches and what
[58:39] she is you know because uh this is the
[58:42] time uh this is the age uh uh God is not
[58:47] asking what you have done or what you're
[58:50] what you did and what you're going to do
[58:53] see praise God it this is like a you
[58:56] know at the cross see there is a two two
[59:00] person two uh two fellow one in the
[59:02] right one in the left praise God they
[59:05] did nothing in their life right the only
[59:08] thing that uh one person he recognize
[59:12] who he
[59:13] is see that's all he needs he recognize
[59:17] him praise God see and Jesus did not did
[59:21] not ask him what have you done no praise
[59:25] God
[59:26] see Hallelujah this is our age also you
[59:29] need to know what you are see and who
[59:33] you are praise God see
[59:37] because like what in the scripture said
[59:41] in Revelation 10 verse 11 praise God it
[59:44] says here and he said unto unto me thou
[59:48] must prophesy again amen okay so we are
[59:53] commissioned to preach the gospel amen
[59:55] PR praise God see if you believe that if
[59:59] you can see that uh John types the bride
[1:00:03] praise God see he is not commissioned to
[1:00:06] preach his commission the bride is
[1:00:08] commissioned to
[1:00:09] prophesy amen see praise God that's two
[1:00:13] different thing praise God
[1:00:16] hallelujah you know praise God see so we
[1:00:20] need to understand who what we are okay
[1:00:24] even the prophet said that see it says
[1:00:27] here now remember this Christ is the
[1:00:31] true church Christ is the true true
[1:00:34] church is a continuation if Christ is in
[1:00:37] the true church it is a continuation of
[1:00:41] the book of Acts okay but the Book of
[1:00:45] Revelation shows how that the Antichrist
[1:00:48] spirit will come into the church and
[1:00:50] defile it making it look one form more
[1:00:54] powerless it
[1:00:56] exposes Satan revealing his word
[1:01:00] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:01:02] and discrediting of God's word right
[1:01:05] down to the time he is cast into the
[1:01:07] Lake of Fire he fights
[1:01:10] that he cannot stand it he knows he
[1:01:15] knows that if the people if the bride
[1:01:19] get the true revelation of the true
[1:01:22] church and what she
[1:01:24] is see
[1:01:26] the prophet keeps saying what she is not
[1:01:29] who she is amen okay praise God it not
[1:01:32] it is not who you are who are you no
[1:01:35] what are
[1:01:36] you see praise God
[1:01:40] hallelujah what she stands he says what
[1:01:43] she stand
[1:01:44] for and she can do the Greater
[1:01:48] Works she will be an invincible Army
[1:01:53] am if you understand what you are that's
[1:01:57] why this message is trying to establish
[1:02:00] us okay praise God hallelujah that's why
[1:02:05] we are planted where we are planted on
[1:02:08] the
[1:02:09] Rock see that's why last night I told
[1:02:13] you we need to go to that holy of holies
[1:02:17] we're going to e something that is
[1:02:20] original praise God Amen but a lot of
[1:02:24] people Overlook it okay
[1:02:26] praise God everything is in is in the
[1:02:29] message praise God
[1:02:31] hallelujah see he says if she
[1:02:36] understand what she is then and in then
[1:02:41] she can do a Greater Works she will be
[1:02:44] an invincible Army right see if they get
[1:02:48] a true revelation of the true Spirit
[1:02:50] within the framework of Christian Church
[1:02:53] okay that's why we need to know who who
[1:02:56] we what we are praise God then we can
[1:02:59] overcome the trick of Satan amen amen
[1:03:03] praise God one more Hallelujah see I
[1:03:06] will not read all the the whole
[1:03:09] quotation okay to save
[1:03:12] time back home it's normal for us to
[1:03:17] have a a long service okay praise God
[1:03:20] it's I know it's different here see but
[1:03:24] home we travel go going to church
[1:03:26] sometimes the the lease is 1 hour okay
[1:03:29] people will travel two
[1:03:34] hours so everybody don't want to have a
[1:03:37] short
[1:03:42] service so I know it's different here
[1:03:44] okay don't you
[1:03:47] worry I will try my
[1:03:49] best praise God now it says here again
[1:03:54] in the next part paragraph same books
[1:03:57] the revelation of Jesus Christ it says
[1:04:00] here you will recall that I mentioned at
[1:04:03] the beginning of this message that this
[1:04:05] book praise God see Hallelujah
[1:04:15] see I think I
[1:04:18] hit amen
[1:04:21] right you will recall that I mentioned
[1:04:23] at the beginning of this message
[1:04:26] uh mentioned at the beginning of this
[1:04:28] message that uh that this book we are
[1:04:32] studying is the act of revelation of
[1:04:34] Jesus himself in the church and his work
[1:04:37] in the future ages that I mention that
[1:04:40] it takes the Holy Spirit to give us to
[1:04:43] give us a revelation or we will fail to
[1:04:45] get it bringing these two thoughts
[1:04:48] together we see you will see that it
[1:04:51] won't take just ordinary study and
[1:04:54] thinking to make this book real it is
[1:04:57] going to take the operation of the Holy
[1:05:00] Ghost
[1:05:02] okay that means this book can't be
[1:05:04] revealed to anyone but a special class
[1:05:08] of
[1:05:09] people praise God see it will take one
[1:05:13] with prophetic
[1:05:16] Insight Hallelujah it will require the
[1:05:20] ability to hear from God right
[1:05:25] it will require Supernatural instruction
[1:05:29] not just a student comparing verse with
[1:05:31] verse though that is good but a mystery
[1:05:35] requires a teaching of the spirit or it
[1:05:39] never becomes
[1:05:41] clear see how we need to hear from God
[1:05:45] and lay of course ourself open and
[1:05:48] become yielded to the spirit to hear and
[1:05:52] to know okay the prophet keep on
[1:05:55] emphasizing to hear yes praise God but
[1:05:59] you know only the sheep can hear the
[1:06:02] voice of the
[1:06:03] shepherd praise God
[1:06:06] hallelujah
[1:06:08] see we need that is prophetic why do we
[1:06:11] need the a prophetic Insight he said
[1:06:14] even though you study the scripture you
[1:06:17] study the message unless you have this
[1:06:20] prophetic Insight praise God and it is
[1:06:24] not for everybody anymore it is for a
[1:06:27] special class of people praise God
[1:06:30] whether you like it or not that's me and
[1:06:35] you okay Hallelujah see praise God then
[1:06:41] the prophet said
[1:06:48] now Hallelujah
[1:07:15] okay now it says
[1:07:24] here amen
[1:07:27] okay I cut it okay as it was day as it
[1:07:31] in the days it says here of
[1:07:34] Noah praise God
[1:07:40] see as it was in the days of Noah so
[1:07:43] shall be in the coming of the son of man
[1:07:46] they were eating drinking marrying
[1:07:49] giving Maring as it was in the days of
[1:07:51] lot so will so will it be in the hours
[1:07:56] of that the son of man will be revealed
[1:07:59] on Earth not Son of God no more okay
[1:08:03] praise God hallelujah he is not in the
[1:08:05] Son of God Ministry anymore he is in the
[1:08:09] son of man Ministry come back as the
[1:08:12] prophetic message for the last day for
[1:08:16] the last day when that eagle will be
[1:08:18] flying not the lion not the ox in the
[1:08:21] sacrifice age then again it says
[1:08:24] hallelujah I this whole audience in the
[1:08:27] name of Jesus Jesus Christ if you could
[1:08:30] if your conscience don't let it be sear
[1:08:32] with unbelief don't let it be
[1:08:36] frustrated can't you see the son of man
[1:08:39] the son of man in the form of prophetic
[1:08:42] message returning back again in his
[1:08:45] church in
[1:08:46] Prophecy okay praise God hallelujah this
[1:08:50] message that we are we are receiving now
[1:08:53] is a prophetic message amen yes this is
[1:08:56] not like I say last night this is not a
[1:08:59] justification
[1:09:01] message this is not a sanctification
[1:09:04] message nor the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:06] Ghost message yes praise God we are now
[1:09:09] in the message of adoption am praise God
[1:09:12] and this message is a prophetic message
[1:09:15] meaning is keep on
[1:09:17] unfolding okay keep on
[1:09:20] revealing is
[1:09:23] Progressive see amen praise God
[1:09:26] hallelujah amen see if if we can follow
[1:09:30] it that's where always the problem come
[1:09:33] in praise God you know way back uh 1995
[1:09:37] in the Philippines we don't know about
[1:09:39] the opening of the
[1:09:42] seals
[1:09:44] Hallelujah then during the
[1:09:47] time brother Ed Bisal come to the
[1:09:51] Philippines praise God see he share
[1:09:55] something to us he share you know about
[1:10:00] about the family of God see he said you
[1:10:05] know s
[1:10:07] Satan can do can do everything except to
[1:10:14] create praise
[1:10:17] God and Satan can see it every time that
[1:10:21] God speaks right he can see he can he
[1:10:25] can see the word of God flying and when
[1:10:29] it touch something it creating something
[1:10:33] amen and then here is the son
[1:10:37] Adam you know he's playing on the water
[1:10:40] you know and Satan saw it when the
[1:10:44] father speaks the word right and then
[1:10:48] Satan tried to grab it but it passed
[1:10:52] through his hand
[1:10:55] and then Adam when he saw
[1:10:59] it he catch
[1:11:02] it and then he put it on the
[1:11:05] water and it become a
[1:11:08] fish my goodness when I heard that
[1:11:12] Hallelujah we all
[1:11:16] jump
[1:11:17] see then speaks about the opening of the
[1:11:20] seals of the seventh
[1:11:23] seal praise God God Amen and that change
[1:11:27] our country upside
[1:11:29] down we look at the message
[1:11:32] differently see like the prophet said
[1:11:36] the Bible become a new Bible it is the
[1:11:38] same Bible okay but now we can read
[1:11:42] between the line we can see praise God
[1:11:46] hallelujah see you know during that time
[1:11:49] one night one night you know when that
[1:11:52] seal is open you know become clear to us
[1:11:55] see you know I always write uh the
[1:11:59] message for Sunday on Saturday as
[1:12:03] sometimes I build up some uh inspiration
[1:12:05] from Thursday Friday then Saturday night
[1:12:08] you'll start putting all of that praise
[1:12:11] God see during that time we still don't
[1:12:13] have that ebook we have no laptop we
[1:12:15] have no computer we are only relying on
[1:12:18] the spoken word book so I'm going to
[1:12:22] start the earliest uh that I can do is
[1:12:25] 9:00 in the evening the latest is 10:00
[1:12:29] because I need all my children to sleep
[1:12:32] first during that time we I live in a
[1:12:35] Shanti praise God see you know we are in
[1:12:38] this satter area and definitely I have a
[1:12:42] lot of I have many children okay I have
[1:12:46] five girls okay
[1:12:48] Hallelujah and three
[1:12:53] boys so
[1:12:56] you they need to sleep first before I
[1:13:00] can write see so you need to
[1:13:04] wait then and um that's 2:00 you know in
[1:13:09] the early morning so I've been writing
[1:13:12] about this you know God is uh creating a
[1:13:15] family a family I said so if he's
[1:13:19] creating a
[1:13:20] family he's creating a family of God yes
[1:13:25] see and then so if the father is
[1:13:30] God so the children is
[1:13:35] God
[1:13:37] see I
[1:13:39] said can it be
[1:13:42] possible amen
[1:13:45] that I am
[1:13:47] God am Hallelujah you know praise God
[1:13:53] yeah I said yes
[1:13:55] yes I'm
[1:13:57] God
[1:13:59] hallelujah see praise God something
[1:14:04] happened you know praise God when that
[1:14:06] seal is when you saw that the seven seal
[1:14:09] is open see the problem if you close it
[1:14:13] praise God where that is where always a
[1:14:15] problem then I think that is a problem
[1:14:17] today some some of the churches they're
[1:14:20] closing it I don't understand why praise
[1:14:23] God hallelujah see so let's move on he
[1:14:26] says here praise God he he uh mine he
[1:14:32] said he a more of prophetic
[1:14:34] message see so if that is a prophetic
[1:14:37] message so we need a prophetic Insight
[1:14:41] amen praise God or else we will we
[1:14:44] cannot understand this message right
[1:14:47] praise God and that's why Hallelujah
[1:14:51] see he says now he is not in the Son of
[1:14:54] God anymore
[1:14:55] more the ministry of our Lord Jesus
[1:14:58] Christ is not in the Son of God anymore
[1:15:01] okay praise God that why that's why he
[1:15:04] was not introduced as the Lamb of God
[1:15:07] but he was introduced how Behold The
[1:15:11] Lion of the tribe of Judah okay praise
[1:15:15] God hallelujah see the prophet said he
[1:15:19] is no not Son of God no more but son of
[1:15:22] man see why because because this message
[1:15:26] is a
[1:15:28] mystery Hallelujah this is a prophetic
[1:15:32] message so we need a prophet to reveal
[1:15:36] it see praise God and who's revealing it
[1:15:40] brother Branham no he is revealing it
[1:15:45] okay praise God
[1:15:48] hallelujah if he is the vine is revealed
[1:15:50] is revealing it to whom to the branch
[1:15:54] okay praise God Amen Hallelujah see
[1:15:57] that's why he said the son of man in the
[1:16:00] form of what message spoken word message
[1:16:06] see if you read that message God is
[1:16:09] revealing his thought to his people with
[1:16:12] the prophetic Insight amen hallelujah
[1:16:17] see that's why if you read that spoken
[1:16:20] word that message amen hallelujah it's
[1:16:24] different right that's
[1:16:26] right
[1:16:28] see but it is
[1:16:31] Progressive see you know when I read
[1:16:34] that
[1:16:35] Masterpiece the first time I read
[1:16:38] it I just saw it something like an
[1:16:41] Evangelistic
[1:16:43] message praise God then the next time I
[1:16:47] read
[1:16:48] it praise God I was
[1:16:51] surprised you
[1:16:53] know when the prophet described
[1:16:56] Michelangelo he went on that on the
[1:16:58] mountain there's a lot of rock there but
[1:17:02] he said Michel Angel Angelo can he can
[1:17:06] see Moses inside the rock
[1:17:09] right then when he saw Moses inside The
[1:17:12] Rock he pulled that
[1:17:16] rock then he tiip off that is not part
[1:17:19] of
[1:17:20] Moses Hallelujah I said whoa amen
[1:17:27] see then the next
[1:17:29] thing praise
[1:17:31] God when I read it the third time you
[1:17:35] know keep on progressing keep on
[1:17:36] progressing amen you see different
[1:17:39] things this message is different
[1:17:43] Hallelujah it is like uh a living water
[1:17:47] flowing freely praise the
[1:17:50] Lord see Hallelujah see that's that's
[1:17:55] why we need a prophetic Insight because
[1:17:57] this message is a prophetic message
[1:18:01] praise God and it is being revealed by
[1:18:04] the son of man praise the Lord see
[1:18:08] hallelujah amen he is no longer amen
[1:18:11] he's no more Son of
[1:18:14] God
[1:18:19] okay if I said something that is not
[1:18:22] according to your pastor always stay
[1:18:25] with your pastor okay I'm just a your
[1:18:27] little uh brother a little servant you
[1:18:31] know praise God I just want to people to
[1:18:34] be uh to be encouraged and to be
[1:18:37] established remember that okay praise
[1:18:41] God then if you can see something just
[1:18:44] charge it to my
[1:18:45] ignorance will you do that amen praise
[1:18:49] the Lord hallelujah then we are not in
[1:18:53] the ripening SE we are not uh implanting
[1:18:56] season okay H Allelujah see we
[1:19:01] are we are now in the ripening season we
[1:19:04] are not in the growing SE we are not in
[1:19:06] the planting season we are not in the
[1:19:09] growing season we are praise God
[1:19:13] hallelujah see this is the Harvest Time
[1:19:17] okay but the Harvest time is the stages
[1:19:20] see when the fruit come out now you will
[1:19:23] say we are now now in the Harvest time
[1:19:26] but then that fruit starting to grow
[1:19:30] Hallelujah see that's why it says in the
[1:19:32] Harvest Time H have you noticed that in
[1:19:35] the Harvest time though there is a real
[1:19:37] acceleration in the ripening there is
[1:19:40] consequently a slowing of growth until
[1:19:44] there is no growth right see praise God
[1:19:50] hallelujah that is our time see we are
[1:19:54] not in the planting season anymore I
[1:19:56] that's that's why I've been telling it
[1:19:58] to the people I've been through that you
[1:20:00] know I went out and evangelize we preach
[1:20:04] under the lampost under the uh under the
[1:20:07] tree we did that in our church we were
[1:20:10] our church was established by signs and
[1:20:14] wonders we went out we prayed for the
[1:20:16] sick and they got healed okay dying when
[1:20:21] we pray praise God instantly God healed
[1:20:24] them
[1:20:25] praise God but those were the days of
[1:20:27] rain outpouring of rain praise God but
[1:20:32] during the ripening season Hallelujah we
[1:20:35] you need another thing okay so now he
[1:20:38] says here
[1:20:40] slowly praise God consequently a slowing
[1:20:42] of growth until there is no growth see
[1:20:46] that's why if you look at this spiritual
[1:20:49] he says is that not exactly in the
[1:20:52] natural what we are seeing now the false
[1:20:55] Vine is losing
[1:20:57] multitudes of to the
[1:21:00] Communist and various other praise God
[1:21:03] and various other types of belief
[1:21:06] imagine Christian right embracing okay
[1:21:11] are you
[1:21:15] online bracing another
[1:21:19] religion see sometimes I can't
[1:21:22] understand it praise
[1:21:25] God see but it's
[1:21:28] happening
[1:21:30] Hallelujah see the false B her numbers
[1:21:33] are not increasing as she would like us
[1:21:36] to think her hold on the people is not
[1:21:39] what it used to be and in so many cases
[1:21:42] going to church is just a
[1:21:44] show see you know before the false Vine
[1:21:48] he can hold the People by by his
[1:21:52] religion right by
[1:21:55] superstitious and all this kind of
[1:21:57] teaching by tradition but today the
[1:22:00] young people you
[1:22:01] know
[1:22:03] Hallelujah this is different amen they
[1:22:06] will not buy it anymore right praise God
[1:22:10] see that's why the prophet said this
[1:22:13] time will
[1:22:14] come when he's saying it praise God it's
[1:22:19] a prop it's a prophecy praise God it's
[1:22:22] keep on going now we can see it l Lally
[1:22:26] right Christian embracing others my
[1:22:30] goodness
[1:22:32] Hallelujah
[1:22:35] see right Christian right like I say
[1:22:39] even the American people they they they
[1:22:42] forgot their history you know about the
[1:22:45] First Amendment right you know it praise
[1:22:48] God why they built that har Harvard
[1:22:51] University Yale University if you you
[1:22:54] Google it it will tell you they build
[1:22:56] that university university so people can
[1:23:00] read the
[1:23:01] Bible and now they are throwing the
[1:23:03] Bible out of that University that's
[1:23:05] right see so they forgot the purpose why
[1:23:08] they built that
[1:23:10] University praise God then it says to
[1:23:13] produce more
[1:23:16] Minister
[1:23:18] Hallelujah
[1:23:19] see but now it's crazy right they don't
[1:23:23] they forgot that their
[1:23:25] history hallelujah amen see they don't
[1:23:29] know what is a freedom of religion they
[1:23:32] thought freedom of religion you can
[1:23:34] worship even
[1:23:35] Satan Hallelujah see they can understand
[1:23:39] it the persecution that the first
[1:23:42] Christian you know the Puritans when
[1:23:44] they run from persecution praise God
[1:23:47] they they cross the ocean and and they
[1:23:49] went to us you know New Foundland H
[1:23:53] Allelujah praise praise God Amen
[1:23:55] Hallelujah they don't know they don't
[1:23:57] understand really praise God they forgot
[1:24:01] that they forget their
[1:24:03] history Hallelujah see praise God Amen
[1:24:08] see and and that false by if you will
[1:24:10] not receive them they will kill you
[1:24:13] right right they they will hold you but
[1:24:16] today they cannot do it anymore
[1:24:18] everybody can do what they want to do
[1:24:20] amen praise God they're losing people
[1:24:23] and the true he says and the true bind
[1:24:26] and what about her her she is
[1:24:29] growing what are those B numbers that
[1:24:32] keep coming to revivals and answer alar
[1:24:35] calls are not most of them merely
[1:24:38] emotional in their
[1:24:40] approach or desires of something
[1:24:43] physical rather than Desiring that which
[1:24:45] is truly
[1:24:48] spiritual Hallelujah then when you in
[1:24:51] the message let's say hallelujah we
[1:24:54] believe this is a True
[1:24:56] Vine what's happening now he
[1:24:59] said praise God
[1:25:02] say they don't want to go into the
[1:25:05] revivals
[1:25:06] anymore praise God you know way back
[1:25:11] 1970s 80s in the
[1:25:14] Philippines after the
[1:25:16] service we we were hit by the Pentecost
[1:25:19] Revival 84
[1:25:21] 8586 see then you know we have a
[1:25:24] something a little still 87 and 88 88
[1:25:29] after the service brother and sister I'm
[1:25:31] telling you once the service is finished
[1:25:35] all the people will line up they want to
[1:25:38] be prayed
[1:25:40] for but today Hallelujah they're almost
[1:25:44] dying and they still don't want to come
[1:25:46] to the church to be prayed
[1:25:49] for it's different now praise God
[1:25:55] hallelujah amen see that's why the
[1:25:59] prophet said is this age are not like
[1:26:01] the day in which Noah entered the Ark
[1:26:04] and the door was shut but yet God
[1:26:06] carried in judgment seven days right
[1:26:10] it's all it's almost the same thing now
[1:26:13] it's quieting down praise God hallelujah
[1:26:17] see so you need to understand it we are
[1:26:20] not in the growing praise God see we are
[1:26:25] now in the ripening season then it says
[1:26:28] here praise God hallelujah
[1:26:32] see now he promised to send you Heavenly
[1:26:35] light to ripen the world seed that will
[1:26:38] be swn for this day the seed is in here
[1:26:42] the seed is the Bible why Jesus said the
[1:26:44] word is a seed that the sers saw and now
[1:26:47] before you can have any crop no matter
[1:26:50] if you saw the seed it's got to have
[1:26:52] light to ripen the seed it don't need
[1:26:57] rain anymore amen see that's a problem
[1:27:02] today you we know the outpouring of rain
[1:27:05] that is the outpouring of the holy
[1:27:07] spirit that will produce the signs and
[1:27:10] wonders amen praise God I'm not against
[1:27:13] signs and wonders okay praise God that's
[1:27:16] why I told you beforehand that our
[1:27:19] church start with signs and wonder
[1:27:23] praise God but this message is keep on
[1:27:25] progressing keep on
[1:27:27] progressing praise God you know way back

[1:28:01] hear me if you keep on
[1:28:04] shouting see it's pure
[1:28:09] emotion praise God that's why the
[1:28:11] prophet said Satan is not afraid of your
[1:28:14] shouting right see amen praise
[1:28:18] God see that's why when you lay you know
[1:28:21] when they lay hands to the sister who
[1:28:23] say Lord
[1:28:24] [Music]
[1:28:27] as simple as that see you cannot hear
[1:28:30] Brother Bram
[1:28:33] keep i k
[1:28:35] you he never did
[1:28:38] that because he said the devil is not
[1:28:41] afraid of your shouting he's afraid of
[1:28:43] your holy
[1:28:45] life see Hallelujah see praise God he
[1:28:50] says it's got to have light to ripen the
[1:28:53] seed or it it will rot and won't do no
[1:28:57] good it will perish but if it's God seed
[1:29:00] on the ground the right ground with the
[1:29:02] right kind of sunlight on it it got to
[1:29:07] ripen okay praise God hallelujah so it
[1:29:10] need to be
[1:29:11] ripened remember that praise God
[1:29:15] hallelujah see but it needs the

[1:30:25] vindicating it making it push out before

[1:32:40] are I said what brother what it is he
[1:32:46] said I know you are a doctor of
[1:32:49] divinity I said what no this that is
[1:32:53] very BAS see in our church even our Deon

[1:32:59] no no no no
[1:33:00] no unless you are a doctor of the vinity
[1:33:03] you cannot you cannot teach that kind of
[1:33:06] subject okay brother I I told him I'm
[1:33:09] going to give you a books oh you write
[1:33:11] that
[1:33:12] book no no that is a seven Church
[1:33:17] ages
[1:33:19] Hallelujah see he can't believe
[1:33:22] it when you go out a very simple message
[1:33:27] to the message
[1:33:29] believer is a very deep subject to the
[1:33:32] denominational people amen praise God
[1:33:35] and they can't believe it that I never
[1:33:37] went into any Bible School see praise
[1:33:41] God hallelujah see so the message
[1:33:44] remember see that's why it says when the
[1:33:47] seals is open it will connect all okay
[1:33:50] praise God hallelujah so again we we
[1:33:54] cannot do anything about it the message
[1:33:56] is just getting clearer and clearer the
[1:34:00] clearer it it become praise God to the
[1:34:03] outside the deeper it is okay but to us
[1:34:07] it's so simple right it's so simple
[1:34:11] praise God hallelujah
[1:34:13] see praise
[1:34:16] God see
[1:34:19] now this why he says here again again
[1:34:23] okay I make it clear see so we need uh
[1:34:27] uh praise God who is coming out the sun
[1:34:33] o and light praise God
[1:34:36] see at the opening of the seals it make
[1:34:39] everything clear remember that
[1:34:42] Hallelujah all the loose end that's why
[1:34:44] this says when the seal is broken okay
[1:34:48] it will connect all the Loose
[1:34:50] Ends what Luther's left what w left what
[1:34:54] the Pentecostal left he will just
[1:34:56] connect it praise God see because they
[1:35:00] really don't understand what they are
[1:35:02] saying see when Martin Luther said no
[1:35:06] that just shall live by faith Hallelujah
[1:35:09] is by Grace by faith
[1:35:13] see they really he he really don't know
[1:35:16] what it
[1:35:17] is when the Prophet come he make it more
[1:35:21] clearer see preise God what
[1:35:24] justification mean right praise God he
[1:35:27] said you know like me I'm brother
[1:35:30] Braham then one one one brother from the
[1:35:33] church WIll accuse me he said brother

[1:35:50] Witnesses the deacons were here then the
[1:35:52] deacons will say yes he is in the
[1:35:56] church then the man will say to him okay

[1:36:03] you then he said how can you forgive me
[1:36:07] right if I did not me if I did not do it
[1:36:12] right that is the meaning of
[1:36:15] justification you have not done it in
[1:36:18] the first place you are
[1:36:21] Justified see that's why I've been
[1:36:23] telling it to the
[1:36:25] people how why is he going to save
[1:36:29] you when you have eternal
[1:36:33] life see he is not saving us that's why
[1:36:38] the future homes the prophet said he's
[1:36:40] not saving you you are always
[1:36:44] saved see he's redeeming us he's not
[1:36:49] saving us amen see he's justifying us
[1:36:53] yes amen blessed is a man that God will
[1:36:56] not impute sin praise
[1:36:59] God
[1:37:01] hallelujah see it's different I've been
[1:37:04] telling it to the people that's why the
[1:37:06] prophet said he can only redeem what his
[1:37:10] own amen praise God he cannot redeem
[1:37:15] everybody
[1:37:16] Hallelujah see only his
[1:37:20] own only the only the one that he can
[1:37:23] redeem
[1:37:24] not not for
[1:37:27] everybody okay that's why the prophet
[1:37:29] said only the redeemable can be redeem
[1:37:33] redeem and saving is two different thing
[1:37:36] okay it is like my son you know he went
[1:37:40] out of the world then praise God he make
[1:37:45] mistake then they put him in
[1:37:48] jail then as the father I go out and try

[1:39:03] him okay now you understand the two
[1:39:06] thing praise God he is not redeeming us
[1:39:10] he's not saving us he's justifying us
[1:39:13] you know praise God like I say you know
[1:39:16] the word justified in Filipino is much
[1:39:19] better because the meaning of Justified

[1:47:14] right amen praise God see that's why
[1:47:17] I've been telling it to the people you

[1:48:43] don't know the way of God anymore and
[1:48:46] the Bible said praise God they live
[1:48:48] according to the imagination see the men
[1:48:51] live according he says she here in uh
[1:48:54] Genesis 6:5 praise God and God saw that

[1:48:58] earth and that every imagination of the
[1:49:01] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[1:49:04] continually see that is Before the
[1:49:07] Flood then after the
[1:49:09] flood man's heart the heart of men are
[1:49:12] evil from his youth see and the Lord
[1:49:15] smell as with Sabor and the Lord said
[1:49:17] into his heart I will not again curse

[1:52:32] the pharmacy okay praise God hallelujah
[1:52:36] see that's why we have hope okay we have
[1:52:39] hope praise God see Hallelujah see so
[1:52:44] until you know then the time come praise
[1:52:47] God see in the time of Moses god gave
[1:52:52] him the seed okay praise God it says
[1:53:00] here in the time of Moses he gave him
[1:53:03] the
[1:53:04] seed
[1:53:06] right Israel started with a
[1:53:10] seed with the
[1:53:12] law it is a shadow praise God see that's
[1:53:18] why he says from that seed Something
[1:53:20] Beautiful will come out
[1:53:24] see what will coming out from that
[1:53:28] seed a holy nation A peculiar
[1:53:33] people a nation of
[1:53:37] priesthood Hallelujah that should be the
[1:53:40] fruits of that
[1:53:42] sin that's why the Bible is very clear
[1:53:45] the law having is Shadow praise God of
[1:53:48] the good things to
[1:53:50] come the law
[1:53:53] is a
[1:53:54] seed and it needs to Bear fruits that's
[1:53:58] why God is always addressing Israel as
[1:54:02] the fig
[1:54:03] tree right praise God see he said I
[1:54:08] found her in the
[1:54:11] wilderness praise God
[1:54:14] see so Israel started with a
[1:54:19] seed and God is expecting
[1:54:23] the
[1:54:24] fruits but Israel
[1:54:28] failed
[1:54:29] Hallelujah until the true seed right
[1:54:33] praise God
[1:54:35] see now when man lost the seed he gave
[1:54:40] it back to
[1:54:42] Moses praise God but Israel failed to
[1:54:46] produce that
[1:54:48] fruits then Jesus come right h
[1:54:53] Hallelujah see when Jesus come came he
[1:54:57] said now he said it I am the true bind
[1:55:01] see when Jesus came he fulfill he
[1:55:05] fulfilled the plan of
[1:55:07] God he fulfilled the program of God he
[1:55:11] is the mind of God in
[1:55:14] flesh praise God say he is the
[1:55:18] seed the seed okay not a seed
[1:55:22] praise God hallelujah he's the word of
[1:55:26] God he's the plan of God he's a program
[1:55:29] of God he's the mind of God made
[1:55:33] flesh but then in 15 he said I am the
[1:55:38] true bind and my father is the husband
[1:55:41] man okay the word husband man it says
[1:55:44] here he is the
[1:55:46] cultivator praise God and today we call
[1:55:49] it
[1:55:50] Farmer see he cultivate praise God now
[1:55:55] from
[1:55:56] sined now he become now the
[1:56:00] vine praise God see Hallelujah he says
[1:56:05] here I am the vine then he said you are
[1:56:08] the branches in verse five he that
[1:56:10] abideth in me and I in him the same
[1:56:13] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[1:56:15] you can do
[1:56:17] nothing if you abide in me and my words

[1:59:06] produces the poen one to the to the
[1:59:09] other brings the fruit and the branch
[1:59:12] and the vine does the same thing see
[1:59:14] that's
[1:59:15] exactly he said now this first tree was
[1:59:19] a prophet tree a perfect tree
[1:59:22] the god of the prophets he was a major
[1:59:25] tree he was God's perfect Prophet tree
[1:59:29] why he was the word now the others was
[1:59:33] Minor Prophets the word came to the
[1:59:36] prophets but he was the word himself in
[1:59:38] the form of a prophet praise God
[1:59:42] hallelujah see now he's trying to tell

[2:00:20] myself I need my right
[2:00:22] tree praise God see so same thing with
[2:00:26] God he is the vine that's why the
[2:00:29] prophet said he needs a
[2:00:31] branch see the branch will only
[2:00:35] produce his seed the branch will not
[2:00:39] produce he her own seed praise God see

[2:01:25] bearers we are the one that will produce
[2:01:29] we will we will uh produce the fruits
[2:01:31] and I believe in St John the 17th
[2:01:34] chapter Jesus said ye are the branches
[2:01:38] and he was the vine now the vine puts
[2:01:40] forth the fruit but the branches has to
[2:01:43] Bear the fruit it is the vine who will
[2:01:45] push out okay the fruits see Hallelujah
[2:01:54] say not okay the fruit not the vine will

[2:02:29] and I believe in St John the 17th
[2:02:31] chapter Jesus said you are the branches
[2:02:33] and he was the vine now the vine puts
[2:02:35] forth the fruit but the branches say to
[2:02:37] Bear the fruit so the branch is getting
[2:02:40] its life out of the vine well it's the
[2:02:42] same kind of life that's in the vine

[2:20:26] door and knock if anyone hear my voice
[2:20:30] and open the door I'll come into to him
[2:20:33] and will St with him and he with me to
[2:20:36] him that overcometh will I grant to sit
[2:20:38] with me in my throne even as I also
[2:20:41] overcame and I'm sat down with my father
[2:20:44] with my father in his throne okay praise
[2:20:48] God imagine he said if you can overcome
[2:20:51] that closed door you will sit with me in
[2:20:54] my father's Throne where is my father's
[2:20:56] Throne is it's in heaven okay Hallelujah
[2:21:01] that's why in Revelation 4 verse1 it
[2:21:04] says after this I look and behold and
[2:21:07] behold a door was open in heaven and the
[2:21:09] first voice which I heard was as it were
[2:21:12] of a trumpet talking with me okay
[2:21:16] now the church ages ended with a closed
[2:21:19] door

[2:21:48] closed door on Earth he says you need to
[2:21:51] hear if my if they can if they hear my
[2:21:54] voice if you hear my
[2:21:55] voice see again that is the
[2:21:58] qualification to overcome that door you

[2:48:07] uh um so you have a little idea what we
[2:48:10] are doing see back in the Philippines we
[2:48:13] have this radio program is very it's
[2:48:16] very fruitful you know we have that
[2:48:19] radio program because that is in mindo
[2:48:21] in mindo is the southern part of of the
[2:48:24] Philippines where the Muslim are you
[2:48:26] know but the Muslim are just a minority
[2:48:29] we have no problem with them but the
[2:48:31] problem we have Message Church in that
[2:48:33] area and there are several of them
[2:48:37] praise God there is one uh the the
[2:48:40] father of Sami Durano this is Sami
[2:48:42] Durano he is the one okay praise God his
[2:48:46] father is a is a founder of a Bible
[2:48:48] School
[2:48:49] and they were being supported by the
[2:48:50] Korean Miss uh Presbyterian church and
[2:48:53] also uh by the moris culu Min Ministry
[2:48:56] but when he got hold of the message he
[2:48:59] found out that the woman cannot preach
[2:49:01] so he recall all his his missionary he
[2:49:04] said you stay home you stay in the
[2:49:06] kitchen then he got angry with the moru
[2:49:10] and the Korean you know you're not
[2:49:12] telling us the truth see cut all your
[2:49:16] support then they you know he he
[2:49:18] separated himself and then uh he
[2:49:21] established six me six
[2:49:23] churches see so when when when when
[2:49:26] these churches learn that uh their
[2:49:30] Pastor has no more support then each
[2:49:32] Church make a way for for their Pastor
[2:49:35] to survive one church will support his
[2:49:37] uh needs every day see but then uh
[2:49:41] because uh you know we know it in the
[2:49:43] message there are so many uh
[2:49:46] teaching then they isolate them self
[2:49:49] when they when he isolate himself you
[2:49:52] know they make their own teaching but
[2:49:55] then before he pass away he called his
[2:49:56] son thei Durano he said go out try to
[2:50:00] look for our brother I know we have a
[2:50:02] real brother in the message try to look
[2:50:04] for them and I met him you
[2:50:08] know uh praise God see so I go there
[2:50:13] I've been going there then he said
[2:50:15] pastor help us so we can cope up you
[2:50:18] know catch up up see praise God what can
[2:50:21] we do see I asked him he told me maybe
[2:50:25] we can do the radio
[2:50:26] broadcast see okay you ask how much it
[2:50:29] will cost then he said
[2:50:33] uh uh then then he he told me it cost
[2:50:39] $200 a month for
[2:50:42] four
[2:50:43] for um how do you
[2:50:46] said uh radio program uh once a week see
[2:50:51] for two
[2:50:52] hours see and for one month we only pay
[2:50:56] $200 I said that's ship for a radio
[2:50:59] program so what they did then every

[3:08:33] country to this country I'm only asking
[3:08:35] the Lord show me the fruits of my labor
[3:08:38] Lord and here in Cambodia praise God
[3:08:42] hallelujah
[3:08:45] see in Cambodia
[3:08:48] so we have no church there okay see
[3:08:53] until this brother brother Paul you know
[3:08:56] and this is in um kampong Chang we have
[3:09:01] no message church until this uh
[3:09:05] see brother P he's the pastor in this
[3:09:09] area I said the denominational church is
[3:09:13] trying to recruit
[3:09:15] him okay but then he said I don't I
[3:09:18] don't want to be in
[3:09:20] denomination he said brother Nester I
[3:09:22] don't want I don't want them to put me
[3:09:25] in a cage he said it you know so he
[3:09:29] understand what the message is see so
[3:09:32] okay brother do you have a place that we
[3:09:34] can build a
[3:09:36] church and this is his house we always
[3:09:38] holding the service here under his house
[3:09:41] but then he said right beside his house
[3:09:44] there is a an open space in that is his
[3:09:47] land and then we buil it see now we
[3:09:51] build this church see there is brother
[3:09:54] bernon myself see and this is Brother
[3:09:58] Paul and this is the pastor of this area
[3:10:00] Pastor P praise God see and then we do
[3:10:04] also uh we help the Vietnamese people to
[3:10:08] to to print the books you know praise
[3:10:11] God see Hallelujah we did a lot of thing
[3:10:14] in Vietnam also and then here is in in
[3:10:19] in in Cambodia see that is the book we
[3:10:22] print the books there and also in Laos
[3:10:25] see now in Laos during that time we
[3:10:28] still don't have church but now by the
[3:10:31] grace of God we have five message church
[3:10:34] building okay amen it's not easy in Laos
[3:10:39] to have a church building it's very very
[3:10:42] difficult see it's La is much EX strict
[3:10:46] very strict than communist China see in
[3:10:50] Laos if they arrest you see the Rel the
[3:10:54] relative will just
[3:10:56] cry because once the police get you they
[3:11:01] don't know where they are going to take
[3:11:03] you they have no such thing a city jail
[3:11:06] or something like a jail or prison house
[3:11:08] no you will just banish see it's very
[3:11:12] strict praise God hallelujah and that's
[3:11:15] why I was also surprised when I learned
[3:11:18] that now we have five message church
[3:11:19] building in Laos praise God hallelujah
[3:11:23] see and then when I went to one time to
[3:11:28] Pakistan say I've been also to Pakistan
[3:11:32] praise God when I went there I found out
[3:11:33] this is the pastor Sajid in
[3:11:36] laor most of the churches in Pakistan
[3:11:39] they are only holding in the you call it
[3:11:41] home Church they have no church building
[3:11:44] see so when I went there I try my best
[3:11:48] you know to help this brother to have
[3:11:50] their own church praise God so they now
[3:11:54] they have their their own home Church
[3:11:56] okay church building I mean praise God
[3:12:01] see I'm just showing you you know in
[3:12:04] Pakistan is
[3:12:07] different this is the
[3:12:11] Deacon the Deacon's hold G okay praise
[3:12:15] God he's the one that uh will stand on
[3:12:17] the door then he is holding his gun so
[3:12:22] you need to
[3:12:25] listen see while you're preaching one
[3:12:28] brother you know one on on your left one
[3:12:31] on your right they're all they're uh
[3:12:34] holding a drone gun okay praise God
[3:12:37] their government require it they want
[3:12:40] the church to have their own militia see
[3:12:43] in case somebody attacked them they can
[3:12:46] fight back until the government troops
[3:12:49] come in see so when I've been there for
[3:12:53] several times see this when I went there

[3:24:25] [Music]
[3:24:43] will God bless you this morning this
[3:24:45] afternoon
[3:24:47] certainly enjoyed that
[3:24:49] [Music]
[3:24:51] today we have many many points today
[3:24:54] that we
[3:24:55] heard certainly thank the Lord
[3:24:58] for it's wonderful though especially to
[3:25:00] see the Lord moving providing for his
[3:25:03] children amenallah and you know the
[3:25:06] prophet said as soon as we lose that
[3:25:08] burden in our lives then we need to get
[3:25:11] back to the
[3:25:12] altar we need to be searching for Souls
[3:25:15] amen
[3:25:17] I really like the way brother Nestor
[3:25:19] said it today I believe the Lord said it
[3:25:21] to us you know we're no longer dealing
[3:25:24] with the Son of God
[3:25:26] Ministry and that might have been
[3:25:28] misinterpreted that we're no longer it's
[3:25:30] no longer the Son of God we know that
[3:25:33] there is a Son of God and and we have
[3:25:37] the Son of God is Jesus Christ but he
[3:25:40] was the representation of God himself
[3:25:43] and
[3:25:44] morphe and we know that through
[3:25:47] kosis he pours himself out and we have
[3:25:51] been given the opportunity to see Christ
[3:25:55] is the mystery of God
[3:25:58] revealed but now through the Holy Spirit
[3:26:00] In Our
[3:26:01] Lives you are the mystery of Christ
[3:26:05] revealed and that's what we heard
[3:26:08] today I think it's just a wonderful
[3:26:10] wonderful message we
[3:26:12] had you know and AR Gap
[3:26:17] we heard
[3:26:18] that perfect
[3:26:21] justification and that's for something
[3:26:23] that was never lost and it was never
[3:26:25] someone else's it was always
[3:26:29] his we uh we've gone over time I know
[3:26:33] some people might be getting fussy
[3:26:34] because we have
[3:26:36] a a seminar coming up for 2:00 we had
[3:26:40] said we'll just bump it a little further
[3:26:43] just relax don't worry be flexible or we
[3:26:47] get bent out of shape right we just need
[3:26:51] to give room for the spirit to move amen
[3:26:53] and not be stuck in a rut right but I
[3:26:57] just think it's so wonderful that you
[3:26:58] know the quote that the brother read
[3:27:00] today is just so beautiful we become the
[3:27:02] blood of Christ how by the
[3:27:06] spirit it's by his spirit and without
[3:27:09] his Spirit we're just like every other
[3:27:11] human being on Earth We're certainly
[3:27:14] thankful for the word thank you brother
[3:27:16] P for coming today for yielding
[3:27:19] yourself we certainly want to
[3:27:21] continue accelerating in the
[3:27:24] ripening God bless you brother let's
[3:27:27] just bow in
[3:27:29] prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we
[3:27:31] just love you and we thank you for your
[3:27:34] goodness and your Tender Mercies to us
[3:27:37] Lord thank you for sending brother ner
[3:27:40] our way Lord Jesus thank you for giving
[3:27:43] us ears to hear and eyes to to see what
[3:27:46] your spirit's saying to the church even
