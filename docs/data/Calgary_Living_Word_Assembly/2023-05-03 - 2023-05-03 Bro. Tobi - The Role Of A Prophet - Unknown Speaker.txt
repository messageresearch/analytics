Christ in the free amen God bless you happy to be in church tonight amen amen the blessing musicians bless you let's quickly read from second Peter chapter one second Peter chapter one I'll just take a verse verse 16. and then we will be seated second Peter chapter one is one of my favorites scriptures in the Bible just because he talks a lot about us verse 16 says for we have not followed cunningly devised Fables when we made known unto you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty may the Lord bless the Ring of his word may you you may have your seat tonight so tonight by the grace of God is a Wednesday night church is a bit half full but quite full for Wednesday night so thank you all for coming tonight by the grace of God I want to speak on the role of a prophet in God's economy the role of a prophet in God's economy and um you know I was going to continue the thought I had prior to Easter when I was talking about servants in acceptable service and I know I did the part two and I said there would be other parts to it but when a pastor um called me and asked if I could take the service this had been on my heart and and I just feel the Lord impressed this in my heart to to speak about this and the sermon tonight might sound like you know um speaking to the choir as they say um but I'm reminded of the fact that the man that introduced Jesus Christ there was a time but the brand said that his eagle eyes got filmed over and his Saints his disciples to go ask Jesus are you the one or do we expect another and as we go on this journey especially with the pressure that we are facing there are times doubts might come into your heart about the prophet of the age you might be there it's not a bad thing to be there and I know that there might be people there tonight otherwise the Lord won't be sending this message to us it might be a Tiny Seed that's been sold in your heart because of something you read on the internet about the brand but what we want to do tonight by the grace of God time permitting is to go back to the Bible and understand why God sent prophets in Bible days and why God still sent a prophet today so we are alive from the beginning I always like to go to the beginning but the Brahm always likes to go to the beginning but let's just see how God started to speak with man the first man God created was Adam and out of Adam came Eve and we saw that God spoke to Adam directly it was like God came down but the Bible tell us he came down at the cool of the evening and he will have fellowship with them they could fellowship with God remember at that time there was no sin so there was nothing that was hindering God from fellowshipping with people because the Bible said God cannot behold sin now when sin came and by the sin that came you know Eve gave birth to the seed of the serpents and then the seed of Adam and the seed of the serpents which we know was Cain killed I'm sorry Abel killed Abel we found that God even still spoke to Cain directly and said to him if you will do what your brother has done then I will accept your sacrifice then we realize that as time went by there was another man in the Bible called Enoch the seventh from Adam and the Bible said he walked with God and was raptured but if you search the scripture Enoch was the first person that was referred to as a prophet it wasn't referred to as a prophet of the Book of Genesis but if you go to Jude Jude talked about Enoch being a prophet and prophesying now later on after Enoch was Noah and Noah the Bible said they found grace before the eyes of God and Noah was the first man that God will send with a message to the people of the Earth to tell them that destruction was coming and after Noah came Abraham why am I going through this I'm trying to let you understand that there was a time that God was speaking to man directly and then he transitioned to God speaking to men so that that man can go and speak to others on behalf of God when God started to deal with Abraham we know that God called him out from his Kindred from his people and God gave him a promise told him to move somewhere else and God gave him a promise of a child but we realized that as God was speaking to Abraham directly at some point God said about Abraham I know that he will command his household his children after him why God had spoken to Abraham but God expected Abraham to pass on the message to his family his household the servants that he had and then then came Isaac and God spoke directly to Isaac and later on came Jacob and God spoke directly to Jacob and all those people brother will tell us Isaac was a prophet because Isaac LeBron said that when Esau came so when Jacob came and and and you know tried to deceive him but Abraham said he was trying to deceive is is his father who was a prophet now Jacob as well also experienced that hearing from God we know what he was you know living fleeing from his brother he saw the vision of heaven so Angels ascending and descending but we also know that when he was with his um his uncle who became his father-in-law God also spoke directly to him and later on then came Joseph one of his sons he was a dreamer and we realized that God also spoke to Joseph because when Joseph got to Egypt and he had to interpret the dream of pharaoh we realized that it's only a prophet that can interpret a dream I'm giving some background here but we'll we'll keep going then it got to a time when God wanted to take out his people from Egypt and then he sent them of prophets so Moses was the first messenger to what we'll call a church well Abraham said the church is called out people and when God sent Moses God spoke to Moses as a matter of fact God started speaking to Moses Moses was going back to the people to tell them what God Said but he got to a Time the people said we wanted to hear from God ourselves would like to hear directly from God and God said well they don't like my pattern so here's what I'm going to do tell them to concentrate concentrate themselves I get those two words mixed together sometimes tell them to consecrate themselves that's the right word because God cannot behold anything that's evil so they had to stay away from their wives they had to clean up themselves they had to clean up okay I won't go there tonight um they had to clean up because God's presence was coming right and when God came the way God came they could not take it they couldn't take the founder Reigns and the Lightnings they realized that when God comes down in his power an ordinary man cannot handle it so the people themselves for the first time said we are not going to hear directly from God let God speak to Moses and then Moses come tell us what God has said now we know that God then sent Joshua after God took Moses and he also had an encounter with the captain of the host of the Lord who told him what they needed to do and then he was able to tell that to the people why are we saying all of this some people in the world think that as Christians the expectation is that we take the Bible we read it we understand it by ourselves and based on that we do what he says it is more than that I've had recent conversations where someone will say oh I've read the Bible and I don't see why it is wrong to do this now this is something that you might not know from what people have said there are about 45 000 Christian denominations around the world today meaning that there are 45 000 different ideas of what the Bible has said now there was a time in the time of Moses I have scriptures to read Deuteronomy chapter 12 might not be able to read all of that because the long read but I'll just talk about it but we'll find that God through Moses was warning the people and telling them don't get to a point where you want to do what is right in your own eyes he didn't say what was wrong what is right in your own eyes that's your understanding of what Moses has said or your understanding of what God expects you've got to take what Moses the servant of the Lord brought to you as instructions from the Lord now we got to a Time when we know you know Moses was there Joshua was dead and the Bible told us that in the days of the judges judges 17 6 says in those days there was no king in Israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes it was a time of trouble people were doing what was right in their eyes people will just try to remember what exactly did did their fathers tell us that Moses said maybe some of them will go to the to the Ten Commandments some will read it some will say some part mattered some will say some part don't matter they did what was right in their eyes and the Bible said because there was no king in Israel now we might think that that King that the Bible is referring to is a physical King so the Book of Judges after the Book of Judges any of the kids can tell me what book is next after judges was what you can tell me sorry after judges was Ruth thanks thanks Elias that's correct but the happiness and the time of rules was also part of the time of the judges so if you go to the Book of Ruth it tells us that in the time of the judges this story happened right so right after the time of the judges when the Bible told us that there was no king in Israel and every man did that which was right in his own eyes what was the solution that God gave after the Book of Ruth was what first Samuel so when every man did what was right in their eyes God did not give them a king God gave them a prophet why because the word of the Lord comes to the prophet so they are gone away from the prophet Moses and then God was restoring them back he willing to restore them back to his word he sent them a Prophets now the children of Israel because God also told him now these nations that that have given you their land I'm not going to utterly take them away all at once because I'm going to leave them there so they can be a snare to you to prove you whether you're going to serve me or not so Israel started to look at those Nations they saw that those nations are the king each of them had Kings and based on that Israel also wanted to patent themselves after those Nations and when they went to Samwell the prophet and said we want a king over us the first thing Samuel said to God is they have rejected me because Samuel understood that in God's economy the role of a prophet is the leader not a king and God told him it is not you they have rejected they have rejected me because the word that is coming from your mouth it does said the Lord so the prophet is only there to represent God himself so one of the things that God did for Israel to make them because the next question is if God speaks to us by prophets and how do we tell which is right which is true and which is false because Jesus also said that false prophets are going to arise and this was not a conversation that first happened when Jesus was here God had already told them through Moses that there will be there will be prophets that will come that will want to lead you away from me so God gave them three things I'll call them the the formula for validating the often series tcd sorry offense TCT of a prophet I know what's happening to my English tonight anyway shall I speak in tongues not everyone will understand so the first thing God said is that if God sends a Prophets God will speak so that man envisions and in dreams so what I want to do tonight is take this three and bring brother Brahm side by side with this and ask ourselves that based on God's Own formula for determining who a prophet is did Brother Graham meet this criteria do we understand amen so Numbers chapter 12 verse 6. and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream now two things I'll make myself known to him in the vision and I will speak to him in a dream now one of the Apostles which we know was the messenger to the Gentiles Apostle Paul he never introduced himself as a prophet but we know he was a prophet because he saw visions and he told us about seeing a vision of going to heaven now I want to read World brother Brahms said about dreams and visions because we as humans most of us have dreams most of us go to sleep and we dream but vision is entirely different and brother Brown being someone that saw hundreds of thousands of visions he explains to us what that is so first thing God speaks to a prophet through visions and dreams the brother said in the message is this the sign of the answer Brothers if you can find it 1962 12 30 evening paragraph 192. he said there is there is difference between dreams and Visions dreams is when you go to sleep Visions when you don't go to sleep we are born that way he's talking about prophets prophets are born that way the ordinary human being when it dreams it is in his subconscious and his subconscious is way away from him his senses is active as long as he is in his first conscious our first conscious is our actual Consciousness when we move around every day in this conscious you you're a normal you see taste fill smell or hear but there's something when you dream that you return back to this conscious so we move away from our Consciousness to our subconsciousness when we go to sleep and that's when dreams happen there is a memory that you remember something that you dreamed about even years ago the ordinary human being is that way but when God predestinates something this subconscious is not way away from here to The Seer The Seer is the same as a prophet but what Consciousness is right together and the Syria in a vision doesn't go to sleep is still in his senses and sees it so imagine dreaming without going to sleep that is what a vision is the Bible said I was explaining that for some doctors the other day and they raised up and sent marvelous never even thought of such a thing when I was taken a wave test and they said they said they had never seen anything like that see well said there is something happens to you the doctor was standing by the brand and I said I told it he said that's that's it exactly seed the two consciouses sit right close together in the case of the Bram is consciousness and his subconscious we're very close together it's nothing I could do and they don't make me know more than anybody else what a humble man it's just God made it that way you don't go to sleep you're right here just like asleep you're standing here looking out like this and all of you have seen it around the world you don't go to sleep standing here on the platform talking to people you hear me going to visions and come back when I'm riding on a car with you anywhere else and tell you things that's going to happen and never fails as never has anybody ever seen it fail they said congregation says no no sir it can't fail it would feel as long as it's god notice right on the platform thousands before tens of thousands of people living in other languages that I can't even speak till you don't feel see it's God so to be called a prophet it must be someone that God speaks to envisions and dreams like I said we as humans who will dream many times but we have to go to sleep before we dream but humans who are called to be prophets and Abraham told us the prophets are born to be Prophets they don't go to sleep before um they see a vision before they dream is almost like dreaming and there are people that God will speak to through dreams that are still not Prophets so Joseph the husband of Mary the Bible never recorded that it was a prophet but the angel of the Lord came to him in a dream right just to kind of give us that difference but if you if he's a prophet God will speak to that man through dreams and visions and I said before a prophets when a prophet interprets a dream but the Brahm said that that Prophet sees the vision of that dream first and see the vision of the interpretation and he's able to tell that that's what happened with Daniel in the Book of Daniel when the king came to him and and came told all this princes like I will not tell you the dream you tell me my dream and tell me the interpretation that's who prophets are so we know that God sent us a prophet because we can see from all these recordings that's we have it's amazing you know you play tape and it is just there it's sometimes I'm driving on the car I'm listening to it and and you get to the discernment and you're like this could only have been God let me read a few a few to us tonight the infallible word of God preached in 1956 but Abraham was in the prayer line but the RAM says that man is a stranger I don't know him Christ does but sir I see your shadowed there's a Darkness I see them taking you into a building it's a hospital then you had an operation then you had another operation and they were for cancer and the cancer remained the doctor has failed to get it but he can't hide from Jesus you're not from this city you are from a smaller city than this it's Rockford Illinois it's where you're from and your name is Leonard I believe they call you and your address is 30 34 8th Street now I say this because you had Faith you're shadowed with death do you believe that Jesus Christ stands here he knowed how to call Kevin speeder you believe it then there's some kind of a spirit got me anointed do you believe it to be the son of God come here oh Jesus Son of God let thy Holy Ghost move into this man and heal him and may his life be spirit and I condemn the devil that's killing him may it leave him this night and may he get well go home and be happy and eat and leave in Jesus name I pray amen there's another one I want to read for the ram the prayer line again message the called outs 1958 said you believe you've had an operation and it's made you awful week you're anemic the tumor made you very weak and you're praying for somebody else a sister she has high blood pressure I see him put the thing from her hand that's right rather a strong man doctor she's got heart trouble she's also got heart trouble is listening like that and beating on her back he said I see he is not dreaming so to say he is actually active is it his Consciousness but God is showing him what happened before miles and miles away remember God said if there is a prophet among you and where I read it was actually you know when God had called Miriam and Aaron and told Moses to call them because they had spoken badly to Moses because of his wife and God started to tell them that when there's a prophet in the land I will speak to him in visions and in dreams and God went ahead to say see Moses is not just an ordinary prophet I speak to him mouth to is here and we know that that's the same with brother Brown why am I saying this tonight as we as we go on just to kind of kind of tell you where my emotions is coming from many times we see what brother Brown said and sometimes we think it's a suggestion it's not that is the will of God for our life we have got to realize that when God sends a prophet it's it's not it's not just like any other preacher we'll go together but but even most of the people that I've written I'm just reading something this morning God's generals the guy that wrote it talk to Bob with the drums peculiar Ministry and I went ahead to say that you know it made a mistake and my question is always been you admit that this man was closer to God than you were right or you are so if he was closer to God will God come tell you that he made a Mr are you able to tell that he made a mistake when it was closer to God when God manifested so much in his ministry more than he ever did in any other person tell us both said that the closest to the ministry of Abraham was the ministry of Jesus Christ himself so when brother Brown says something under the anointing of the Holy Spirit is God speaking to us and the reason why God Vindicated that Ministry Beyond any reasonable doubt is so that we can have an uncle to hold to young people people will ask you questions it's getting so difficult now let's even talk about women wearing pants it's totally insane to some people when you tell them that a woman should not wear pants because the Bible said so because they will tell you their parents that are made for women but the reality is 50 years ago 60 years ago those that are much older the grandmas or the grandpas here we tell you that when they were growing up women did not wear pants Christian women did not wear pants and when they started wearing pants they were wearing pants that were made for women not mainstream they started to make pens for women which meant that something changed and at that time the Christian women will stay away from it because of the word of God so if it has become a great area now and it's hard for you to comprehend how to even convince someone that hands for women is wrong just take what the prophet has said what I'm saying tonight is God Vindicated this prophets so well that you can just completely block your ears to every other thing and say you know what if he's wrong I'd rather be wrong the second thing that God told him to tell if a prophet is from him or not is that when God sends a Prophets God will vindicate his ministry so that all its prophecies will come to pass Deuteronomy 18 21-22 the Lord was speaking through Moses to the people of Israel he said and if thou shall say in thine hearts how shall we know the word with the Lord had not spoken so when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the faith follow North now come to pass that is the thing which the Lord had not spoken but the prophet has spoken it presumptuously thou shall not be afraid of him so how do we tell the prophet is true we want to watch what he says and see if he came to pass now there's so many things where the Bible says that has come to pass but let's just go back to 1933 when he saw a vision of seven events that the Lord said will come to pass before he's coming and some of them might not be able to relate to it because it happened many years ago but there is one that we definitely can relate with Ram says in the exposition of the seven Church ages the loud Asian Church age he said if you will pardon a personal note here I base this prediction on seven major continuous visions that came to me one Sunday morning in June 1933 and brother Ram before he had predicted that the world that Jesus will come by 1977 and he repeatedly said this is not a prophecy this is my prediction and now he's explaining why he based on his calculation predicted 1977 could be the time that Jesus Will Come or by Jesus would have come by 19 77. said the Lord Jesus spoke to me and said that the coming of the Lord was drawing now but that before he came seven major events will transpire I wrote them all down that's morning I give for the revelation of the Lord the first Vision was that mussolony Mussolini will invade Ethiopia and that Nation will fall at its steps that Vision surely did cost of repercussions and some were very angry when I said it I will not believe it but it happened that way he just walked in there with his modern arms and over and took over the natives didn't even have a chance but the vision also said that muslimi would come to a horrible end with his own people turning on him that came to pass just exactly as it was said the next Vision foretold an Austrian by the name Adolf Hitler will raise up as a dictator over Germany and it will draw the world into war it showed the the seed fried line and how our troops would have a terrible time to overcome it then it showed that Hitler will come to a mysterious end we know that happened as well the third Vision was in the realm of world politics where it showed me there will be three great isms fascism Nazism communism but that but that the first two will be swallowed up into the third The Voice admonished watch Russia watch Russia keep your eye on the King of the North the fourth Vision showed great advances in signs and that's the one I say we can easily relate to that will come after the second World War I believe that ended in 1948 somewhere around there it was headed up in the vision of a plastic bubble topped car that was running down beautiful highways on the remote control so that people appeared seated in this car without a steering wheel and they were playing some sort of a game to amuse themselves now if this Vision came in 2005 we can say well we probably made it up but this came in 1933 the kind of cars they had at that time compared to what brother Brown saw it only have been God that could have showed him the future most of the kids all like Tesla my kids at least they always I've been we're driving but we see a Tesla everybody goes hey that's a Tesla well that is not rich enough to buy one yet but one of the things that you see with this advancement of cars apart from the fact that their electric cars is the fact that there's a lot around driverless cars and they're going to be on our streets there's some on our streets but they're going to be more common on our streets very soon as soon as the regulations uh you know are tidied up and they can allow them to drive but God showed this Vision to his prophet almost a hundred years ago the fifth Vision had to do with the moral problem of our age centering mostly around women God showed me that women began to be out of their place with the granting of the votes then the cut of their hair which signified that they were no longer under the authority of a man but insisted on either equal rights or in most cases more than equal rights she adopted men's clothing and went into a state of undress until the last picture I saw was a woman naked except for a little fig leaf type apron it's getting to Summer Brothers let's get into summer you need that cross in your car to look away yeah a state of undress LeBron said with this Vision I saw the terrible perversion and moral of light of the whole world the sixth Vision there was a in America are most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in their complete power I believe that this was the rise of the Roman Catholic Church though I knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in America due to a popular vote by women and said the last and the seventh Vision was wherein I heard a most terrible explosion as I turned to look I saw nothing but debris craters and smoke all over the land of America so those were seven visions that God gave with Abraham in 1933. we have seen most of them come to pass some of them we have seen in our age like in our own time not the age as you know from when when the age started the Malaysian age but we are saying that we have seen that in our own lifetime we are still the driverless car on the streets not no more in the laboratory on the street but the brand was here he said they were already having it in the laboratory before he left but now we can see them on the street and God told us that the way to tell if a prophet is true watch what he says if he comes to pass then that's a true prophet if he does not come too fast then that's a false prophet and there are many false prophets today we have a lot of them in Nigeria and he's getting to the end of the year prophecies are coming about the following year when an election is coming up prophecies are coming most of those prophecies are just guesses and when they don't come to pass people still keep following them well brother Brown challenged people many many many times over in his meetings and said you tell me one that has failed and nobody could come there was a time some people wanted to challenge him on some of the doctrines that he brought from the Bible I can't remember that I was going to find that story but I couldn't lay my hands on it but the brother that we're going to go with him he told the brother you know what these people have rented this place to use they are not going to use it but I said no they already paid for it but Ram said no they're not going to use they're going to use somewhere else and then he told the brother where each and every one of them receipts in that room when they all gather together the brother came and said you know what you might disagree with brother Brown on his doctrines but everything you have seen here he already told me before we got here God visited Us in this age now the last one still have a few minutes God says to his people the people of Israel that another way to tell the true Prophets or maybe not just telling a true prophet but one way to test a prophet and see whether you should obey him or not is by seeing whether this Prophet will point the people to the word or not so Deuteronomy Chapter 13 Verse 1 to 3. and this is very interesting because if the brand passed the two first tests and he filled this one then we have every reason to say no we are not going to follow him because in this one I'm going to read a true prophet could actually fail this test now this is what it says if there arise among you of prophets or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign and a Wonder and the sign or the one that come to pass see ing a vision he said it it has come to pass right wherefore it speak unto this saying let us go after other gods we that was not known and let us serve them thou shall not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the Lord your God proveth you to know whether yield Lord the Lord your God with all your hearts and with all your soul so Prophet a dreamer of Dreams can be true sent from God everything he says comes to pass but when he turns you away from the word God tells you don't follow him why I am intentionally doing that to prove you to see if you will love me now we know brother Brahm did not tell us to go away from the word was to point us to the word everyone that is against for the brand the only reason they're against him is because he pointed us to the word is because he preached what Paul preached when you show them the Bible I'm going to read what Abraham here to one of the places he just kind of reiterated his position when you open to Acts chapter 2. and tell them this is how baptism happened in the Bible they will explain it away from you I don't get to read all those nonsense that the sign whatever believe this belief the sign is what I'll call them because they don't definitely believe the sign and all the things they write but some of the things that I've seen them say is that they're trying to say brother I'm got the the the the doctrine of the right baptism from the Oneness people no it's from the Bible it's not about the Oneness it's exactly from the Bible from the pages of the scripture he brought it back to us what God Said here in condemnation by representation he said don't try to judge God by our own feeling we've got to judge God by his words and what he said don't go off on what some tantrum this is a great church has wedded a lot of Storms and these is that come back to what God Said I stand before him I want to be found innocence of ever trying to add one thing to that word or take one away once you just believe it just exactly the way it is teach the people to turn right up to it over the brand wanted to do is to present the words not his own ideas just a word and the Bible says this I can't help what anybody else sees if the Bible says this I can't help what anyone else says I got to stay right with that is that for washing feets they say ah Pentecostal brethrenal brother oh brother oh we used to do that and I said let's do it yes if we did it once Jesus did it washing Faith oh say it's unhealthy people has athletic feet the Bible said I don't care what they got they might have had it in them days in the days of Jesus right where the gene says they get healed I'm saying yeah yeah that's right God Is A Healer see they try to find a way of Escape like say oh I wouldn't drink out of some glass that somebody else drank out of unless it was scuttled oh my my brother and sister is my brother and sister amen God is my protection if something is wrong I trust him said let's go back to the word I don't care it's called or whatever it is or what church he belongs to you if he's my brother he is my brother I'll carry out the Commandments of God so that's the reason friends when it comes to water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ I must remain there oh that keeps me from many great saving Souls out there because with the brown we know that when he started holding on to the doctrine that God has shown him according to the Bible it lost a lot of freight most of his sponsors won't sponsor him anymore so he said well it might keep me from grade seven Souls out there it sure does on that one issue because of the extreme trinitarian belief something that is not in the Bible that was what happened to Israel Israel decided to reject the prophet of God and accept organization Samuel told him you want a king over you when you have the skin you don't have choice on what happens to your sons and your daughters it's going to mix this out of them yet they said no we want the king the Bible says sure I believe in father-son Holy Ghost as offices of God not of free Gods but three offices of the same God he is Father Son and Holy Ghost but that's titles of his office he is God the Father sure he was in the beginning he is God the son was made Flesh on Earth is God the Holy Ghost which is in me but it's the same God all along three offices it once couldn't be touched or nothing then he calmed down was made flesh and took my sins and bore my sins then while he Sanctified me with his own blood then the Holy Ghost will come in and he and I can Fellowship like we did in Eden will love one another is my father and his son not three gods that same God that created me and loved me gave itself for me is a God that's in me his name was Jesus Christ when he was on Earth there is not another name given under Heaven among women whereby you must be saved now if he hurts my friends I can't help it I'd rather hurt my friend than hurt my father she is my relative my father God that's what his word says God had he never let me hybrid I bred anything saying the days of Miracles despised oh Jesus doesn't do the same oh that might be telepathy that might be mind reading I don't believe we have prophets in these days but I'm saying the Bible said we would I believe it we're looking for one and not for for anointing one like John the Baptist you come forth to forerun the first coming of Christ comes to follow the second coming of Christ as he did he promised that restore the faith of the people back to God what was John to do restore the feet the faith I was once the real sea that was in the guardian of Eden to take God's word where it was I bread in by churchianity John comes to bring it back Hallelujah to shake the nation before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord comes that's John's Mission anointed one so we see that these three things that God said we should look out for in telling if a prophet is from God or not we have brought for the brown to the test and he has passed the test does that make you feel good so we'll tell Satan to shut his mouth we'll tell the critics to shut their mouths this message has been given to us it's it's it's one of the greatest things that God has done through all the ages is one of the greatest things God has never revealed himself in plainness as he has today I'll call the musicians he hasn't revealed himself like like Brother Bear was saying I guess last Sunday the Saints of all other ages they knew God in part they couldn't see the entire picture and I was thinking about it why would brother Brown be so much Vindicated by God so that we'll have no reasonable doubts so that our senses even if we were to rely on senses and go away from Faith which we are told not to do even by senses we'll be able to tell that this man was the greatest man that God ever used in this generation [Music] so if doubts come if somebody says something there's something brother Brahm says and something in you is reasoning against it and say it doesn't matter remember that is no one else but the devil okay amen there's a song we used to sing I don't think we have it here he said in the days in this days of Trials so near the end when Christ from Glory not now descent men's hearts are failing and filled with fear we know the end is surely here says Soul just be faithful believe his word listen to the prophets that you've heard listen to his message uh listen to The Prophet's message he'd walk in the light where is turned Dudley said in every age a light did Shine to point God's people the truth to hear he said in this last age a light shines bright so men receive it walk in the light another verse says don't be fearful for getting it because I'm not singing it I'm just trying to read the lyrics said your Prophet sleepeth is not that the bride is waiting for the call and in that hope without Rejoice so be faithful believe his word stay with the message you have heard listen to His prophets is message heat walk in the light while where is Sarah [Music] let's sing let's be on our feet tonight so it's just been a little bit of a Bible study a reassurance telling us that we have not believed cunningly devised Fables if they should do anything at all to you should increase your confidence in the message remember Paul was saying it during the song service God gave our Prophet the opportunity to go beyond the curtain of time and when was there they told him you will be judged by what you have preached and he said will Paul be judged as well I said yes I said okay that's good because I preach what Paul preet if the people of Paul will make it then my people will make it and then what was the response that you and I gave we said we are resting on that year not only Thrones [Music] life me way [Music] s [Music] all power above is [Music] good morning we've got to know [Music] me dreams

[Music] of these presence I say Lord I believe this time oh Lord I believe thank you [Music] Lord I believe [Music] Lord I [Music] believe you know um the pastor of the church we were in Nigeria before we moved here was saying something recently which I think was profound I've heard him say many times he said if brother Brown were to raise up for the from the dead today and come and tell him that sorry the message was wrong it's going to look at the Brahm in the face and say sorry you came too late this has already changed my life I think that's the greatest Vindication of the message in our lives that we can say that we were once sinners [Music] for By the Light of the word has been given on this age our lives have been transformed let's just battle pray tonight dear father this has been done Lord Jesus according to your word [Music] to encourage your people thank you if there be any doubt Lord Jesus about this gift of a message that you've given unto us in this last day in the heart of any of my brothers or sisters even if My Heart Lord Jesus has something hidden somewhere that Satan is speaking something Lord Jesus that's contrary we rebuke it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ father may I felt increase in this word that you have given unto us to believe it Lord Jesus because the Bible told us that we would believe our prophets in the name of a prophet it will receive the prophet Lord help us to believe with all of our hearts dear father to realize their lord Jesus Christ that we have not followed commonly the vice versions Lord the god of Heaven has given us his will and his word for our lives in this age and we want to live by it's their lord Jesus we want to live by you to the letter there father there are things in our lives Lord Jesus where we have
