[43:30] privileged to be in the house of the
[43:31] Lord again today. Just want to express
[43:34] our gratitude. Brother Manuel prayed
[43:36] about gratitude. It's very important
[43:38] &gt;&gt; to thank God because when we thank him
[43:42] then he does more for us.
[43:45] Amen.

[58:03] Thank you so much for the effort and the

[58:12] if you would as we change the order
[58:13] tonight or this morning, sorry. Can you
[58:16] hear the sound from heaven? It's a sound
[58:18] of worship coming from his throne.
[58:21] Where's his throne today? Right here.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; This is the throne of God this morning.
[58:25] Sing it this morning as our pastor comes
[58:29] singing holy, holy, holy. You think
[58:31] about the the the being that God is. He
[58:34] desires worship so much that he created
[58:36] cherubams and angels to worship him day
[58:39] and night singing holy, holy, holy for
[58:42] millions, billions, trillions of years.
[58:44] who knows before he stepped on the scene
[58:47] and said, "Okay, it's time to create the
[58:49] world." Think about that. The God of
[58:51] glory desires worship. Here we are the
[58:53] redeemed this morning. Well, can you
[58:57] hear the sound from heaven?
[59:03] Like the sound of many waters,
[59:10] it's the sound of worship
[59:14] coming
[59:16] around your throne.
[59:21] Oh yes.
[59:25] Oh
[59:28] [Music]
[59:39] their voice
[59:41] to me.

[1:01:28] holy
[1:01:30] are you Lord. One more time to him
[1:01:34] today. Hallelujah.

[1:01:52] "Holy, holy,
[1:01:56] holy

[1:02:00] [Music]
[1:02:07] and angels.
[1:02:11] [Music]
[1:02:14] We worship you now.
[1:02:20] Holy, holy,
[1:02:23] holy
[1:02:25] are you Lord.
[1:02:31] Hallelujah.
[1:02:32] Thank you, Lord. God bless you this
[1:02:35] morning. Welcome to the house of the
[1:02:36] Lord.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Each and everyone
[1:02:40] just have a few requests that we'd like
[1:02:41] to bring before the throne this morning.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Remember Sister Germaine and the family,
[1:02:49] Sister Debbie Fussy and the family.
[1:02:52] Want to remember the Nigeria hostage
[1:02:55] situation.
[1:02:57] Also like to remember my mother-in-law,
[1:02:59] Sister Elaine.
[1:03:03] Brother Daniel Omillion. He has a a f
[1:03:06] business friend. Farhead Shamzian I
[1:03:10] believe is the name. He needs he needs a
[1:03:13] a prayer. He asked for prayer. This is a
[1:03:16] I believe a Muslim man asked brother
[1:03:18] Daniel for prayer
[1:03:21] that he could sell a house. And we know
[1:03:23] if God could heal a body, he could sell
[1:03:24] a house.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; If you have a need this morning, maybe
[1:03:28] just make it known unto him by way of an
[1:03:29] uplift hand as we go to him in prayer.
[1:03:33] Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[1:03:35] we're so thankful that we can call you
[1:03:38] our gracious heavenly father, because
[1:03:41] you are so wonderful to us, Lord, so
[1:03:45] merciful and long-suffering, Lord, and
[1:03:48] all of our ways.
[1:03:50] But, Father, we're so thankful that our
[1:03:52] ways are not your ways. And neither are
[1:03:55] our thoughts
[1:03:57] your thoughts. Your thoughts are higher
[1:04:00] than ours, Lord. And we're so thankful
[1:04:02] that we can not look at ourselves, Lord
[1:04:05] Jesus, but we can look to you. We can
[1:04:08] look at you, Father, and look to see the
[1:04:10] image of you, Father, in one another.
[1:04:13] Lord Jesus, this morning, more than
[1:04:15] anything, our desire is to exalt you
[1:04:18] above everything, Father. Above all of
[1:04:21] our problems, all of our circumstances,
[1:04:24] all of our situations.
[1:04:26] Father, we love you and we thank you for
[1:04:28] your goodness to us, Lord. Because we
[1:04:31] know the only reason we're here today is
[1:04:33] because of your goodness. The only
[1:04:35] reason we have breath in our lungs is
[1:04:38] because of your goodness, Lord. Oh,
[1:04:41] Father. And then to be able to
[1:04:42] understand the word for our day. Talk
[1:04:45] about mercy. We thank you, Lord Jesus,
[1:04:48] for your ever loving kindness to us,
[1:04:50] Lord. Amen.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Gracious Lord, this morning we just want
[1:04:56] to remember the needs, Father, that
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; were brought forward, that were made
[1:05:01] known unto you, Lord Jesus. We know that
[1:05:04] Sister Charmaine needs a touch from you,
[1:05:06] Lord.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; We know that her family needs a touch
[1:05:09] from you, Lord.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to remember all of
[1:05:13] her children, Lord Jesus.
[1:05:16] Brother Dodie and his family, Lord. And
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; oh, Father, Brother Martin and Sister
[1:05:21] Adijah,
[1:05:23] Brother Mua and his family, Lord.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Father, we know that they all desire to
[1:05:28] come and worship. And we pray that Lord
[1:05:30] Jesus, even through these circumstances,
[1:05:33] their desire would be to come and
[1:05:35] worship you more.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Father, we know that would be the the
[1:05:39] mama's desire, Sister Charmaine. And
[1:05:42] Father, she has held the line in her
[1:05:45] home. Father, we pray that you would
[1:05:47] just strengthen her, that you would
[1:05:48] encourage her, Father, that you would
[1:05:50] bless her abundantly
[1:05:52] above all she could ask or think. Lord,
[1:05:55] Father, we thank you for touching Sister
[1:05:57] Charmaine and her family. Lord, we just
[1:06:00] want to remember Sister Deb Busy,
[1:06:03] Brother Charlie, Lord Busy, and and the
[1:06:06] family, Lord, the loss of Sister
[1:06:08] Debbiey's sister. pray that you would
[1:06:10] just be with them. Lord, comfort them,
[1:06:12] Father, in their time of mourning.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we just Lord, we also
[1:06:17] want to remember the situation in
[1:06:19] Nigeria with the hostages, Father.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, some things are just we can't even
[1:06:25] explain it. We can't even understand it,
[1:06:27] but we just trust you, Lord. in the
[1:06:29] midst of the trial.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; And we just pray for those families,
[1:06:32] Lord, and the congregations and the
[1:06:34] pastors affected by these these actions,
[1:06:38] Lord,
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; that your will would be done.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; And Father, we just want to remember
[1:06:43] Sister Elaine, my mother-in-law. Father,
[1:06:46] she needs a touch from you, Lord. And
[1:06:48] we're so thankful that you're more than
[1:06:49] able. We pray that you would just heal
[1:06:51] her now in the name of Jesus.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Father, we just thank you for touching
[1:06:56] her. We just want to remember the need
[1:06:58] that brother Daniel brought forward,
[1:07:00] Lord, for Farhead, his business partner,
[1:07:02] Lord, his business associate. Lord, one
[1:07:05] more time, we just invite you to come on
[1:07:07] the scene at the word of brother Daniel
[1:07:10] and just minister to that need, Lord.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; And Father, we'll be careful to give you
[1:07:15] all the praise. Lord,
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; now Father, we just invite you, Lord, to
[1:07:19] minister to each and every need that was
[1:07:21] made known unto you this morning by the
[1:07:23] way of an uplift hand in our
[1:07:24] congregation here. We know that you know
[1:07:26] the need. We know that you allowed the
[1:07:29] situation to come. And Father, it was
[1:07:33] because you had a desire in your heart,
[1:07:34] an attribute that you wanted to express.
[1:07:37] And we just invite you, Father, to
[1:07:39] express that to us and through us.
[1:07:42] Father, we pray that you would
[1:07:43] sovereignly meet the needs, Lord Jesus,
[1:07:45] in the hearts of your children this
[1:07:47] morning. Lord Jesus, we love you and we
[1:07:50] thank you. We just commit this service
[1:07:52] into your hands now for your glory. In
[1:07:55] Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:59] Amen. Thank you musicians.

[1:08:06] one for the specials.
[1:08:09] It really does something. It sets an
[1:08:11] atmosphere. God bless you. Amen.
[1:08:21] I uh I noticed something this morning
[1:08:23] that I just needed to
[1:08:26] announce. Maybe if you want to turn in
[1:08:27] your Bibles with me to Genesis chapter
[1:08:29] 14.
[1:08:31] I believe we have someone very special
[1:08:33] in our midst today.
[1:08:35] And uh I just would like to welcome I
[1:08:39] believe and I could be wrong. Is that
[1:08:41] Mrs. Juma Bulandi we have with us in our
[1:08:45] midst.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; God richly bless you sister
[1:08:51] Juma's wife
[1:08:54] his bride has been working on the
[1:08:56] immigration status for a long time now
[1:09:00] probably over a year and uh here she is.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's answered prayer. God bless
[1:09:07] you sister.
[1:09:10] also like to welcome our friend brother
[1:09:13] Gordon Dole with us. God bless you
[1:09:15] brother.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; It's good to have you here.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 14
[1:09:24] verse 10.
[1:09:29] Genesis 14 verse 10.
[1:09:33] I'm sure we're all familiar with this
[1:09:34] scripture. And the veil of Sidim was
[1:09:39] full of slime pits. And the kings of
[1:09:42] Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there.
[1:09:45] And they that remained fled to the
[1:09:47] mountain.
[1:09:49] And they took all the goods of Sodom and
[1:09:51] Gomorrah and all their vituals and went
[1:09:54] their way. And they took Lot,
[1:09:56] Abram&lt;unk&gt;s brother's son, who dwelt in
[1:09:59] Sodom and his goods, and departed.
[1:10:04] And there came one that had escaped and
[1:10:07] told Abram the Hebrew. For he dwelt in
[1:10:10] the plain of Mamry, the Amorite, brother
[1:10:14] of Echel, the brother of Anar, and these
[1:10:19] were confederate with Abram.
[1:10:22] And when Abram heard that his brother
[1:10:24] was taken captive,
[1:10:27] he armed his trained servants, born in
[1:10:29] his own house, 318,
[1:10:33] and pursued them unto Dan.
[1:10:36] And he divided himself against them, he
[1:10:39] and his servants by night, and smokeote
[1:10:41] them, and pursued them unto Hoba, which
[1:10:45] is on the left hand of Damascus.
[1:10:48] And he brought back all the goods and
[1:10:50] also brought again his brother Lot and
[1:10:54] his goods. And the woman also
[1:10:58] and the people. The king of Sodom went
[1:11:01] out to meet him after his return from
[1:11:04] the slaughter of Chedor
[1:11:10] and of the kings that were with him at
[1:11:14] the valley of Shabbath, which is the
[1:11:17] king's dale.
[1:11:19] And Melzdc, king of Salem, brought forth
[1:11:23] bread and wine,
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; and he was the priest of the most high
[1:11:28] God.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; And he blessed him, and said, "Blessed
[1:11:33] be Abram of the most high God, possessor
[1:11:38] of heaven and earth. And blessed be the
[1:11:40] most high God, which hath delivered
[1:11:43] thine enemies into thine hand."
[1:11:47] And he gave him tithes of all.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; And the king of Sodom said unto Abram,
[1:11:54] "Give me the persons, and take the goods
[1:11:58] to thyself."
[1:12:00] And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I
[1:12:03] have lift up mine hand unto the Lord,
[1:12:06] the most high God, the possessor of
[1:12:09] heaven and earth,
[1:12:11] that I will not take from a thread, even
[1:12:16] to a shoe latchet, and that I will not
[1:12:19] take anything that is thine, lest thou
[1:12:23] shouldest say, I have made Abram rich.
[1:12:28] save only that which is the young men
[1:12:30] which the young men have eaten and the
[1:12:33] portion of the men which went with me
[1:12:37] anor
[1:12:38] and memory let them take their portion
[1:12:43] let's just bow one more time heavenly
[1:12:46] father we thank you Lord that we have
[1:12:48] this scripture here and we can see so
[1:12:50] many types and shadows in it father we
[1:12:53] just pray that you would take this word
[1:12:55] that's spoken and
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; written and Lord that you would break it
[1:12:58] open to us fresh once again. We just ask
[1:13:01] all these things in Jesus Christ's name
[1:13:03] we pray. Amen.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. You may be
[1:13:06] seated.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Welcome back to the house of the Lord
[1:13:09] this morning. Just a few announcements
[1:13:12] before we get into our scripture. We've
[1:13:14] got the communion service tonight, this
[1:13:16] afternoon, actually at 5:30 p.m. I was
[1:13:19] thinking about this as I was announcing
[1:13:21] it, and I know some people, they
[1:13:22] actually get upset if you don't have a
[1:13:25] communion service after 6:00 in the
[1:13:27] evening because then it's not actually a
[1:13:29] supper. It's not the Lord's supper. But,
[1:13:32] you know, I don't think that the Lord
[1:13:33] really gets too hung up on semantics
[1:13:36] when it comes to things like this. I
[1:13:38] think that's more of a legalistic
[1:13:39] perspective myself, but uh I'm sure
[1:13:42] someone would have something to say
[1:13:44] about it if they really saw it that way.
[1:13:46] And you know, we're entitled to see
[1:13:47] things the way that I guess the spirit
[1:13:49] leads us. But I think really he knows
[1:13:52] our heart and what our heart's desire is
[1:13:55] if we're willing to come and actually
[1:13:57] partake of the communion service. It'll
[1:13:59] be at 5 5:30 tonight. And uh we also
[1:14:02] have a testimony service. So, it's
[1:14:04] always a wonderful time of just I
[1:14:06] believe giving giving the Lord the
[1:14:08] praise and at the same time giving the
[1:14:09] devil a black eye
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; because we share what the Lord is
[1:14:13] actually doing in our lives today. It's
[1:14:15] not about somewhere out in the future
[1:14:17] or, you know, something in the past
[1:14:19] necessarily. It's actually what he's
[1:14:21] doing right now. And I think that's a
[1:14:23] tremendous thing. We have the youth
[1:14:26] service coming up on the 31st. While the
[1:14:28] whole world goes and celebrates
[1:14:30] Halloween and death and hell and the
[1:14:32] grave, we can get together and worship
[1:14:35] God. And that's what the uh youth
[1:14:36] service is about. We've got that on the
[1:14:39] 31st at 7:30 here in the sanctuary. And
[1:14:42] uh we have brother Cadre Diggs coming on
[1:14:44] November the 22nd at 6 PM and the 23rd
[1:14:48] at 10:00 a.m. And also uh we mentioned
[1:14:51] it on Wednesday, but we are putting
[1:14:53] together a graduation celebration for
[1:14:56] 2025 and it will actually be in May or
[1:14:59] June in 2026. So uh we also want to
[1:15:04] catch up on any of the graduates who
[1:15:06] have graduated uh who haven't been
[1:15:08] celebrated in the body here in the last
[1:15:10] few years. We certainly want to
[1:15:12] celebrate and appreciate your
[1:15:13] achievements as well. It applies to
[1:15:16] post-secary degrees or diplomas and
[1:15:18] grade 12 graduations as well. So, if you
[1:15:21] have um graduated any one of those three
[1:15:25] uh items and you would like to
[1:15:26] celebrate, we will be planning an event
[1:15:29] in May or June of uh 2026.
[1:15:33] So, God richly bless you. We'll
[1:15:34] certainly keep you posted as things
[1:15:36] develop. Are you happy this morning?
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Today I want to just talk about um
[1:15:42] a little bit about communion and I felt
[1:15:44] led to go down the road of uh Melzdc and
[1:15:48] Abram. You know it was before Abram
[1:15:51] actually had a name change. He actually
[1:15:54] met with the Lord and you know there was
[1:15:56] a few steps in his life that he had to
[1:15:58] go through and one of them was he had to
[1:16:00] actually follow the leadership of the
[1:16:01] Lord, the direction of the Lord. He told
[1:16:03] him to leave all of his family and all
[1:16:05] of his home and actually travel to a new
[1:16:07] location. And uh he did that, but he
[1:16:10] didn't actually do it exactly according
[1:16:12] to the word of God. And that's the call
[1:16:14] for the bride in the age in which we
[1:16:15] live is to follow the word exactly
[1:16:18] according to the word of God. And you
[1:16:20] know, Abram, he was blessed all the way
[1:16:23] along until there began to have strife
[1:16:26] between the herdsmen. That's what the
[1:16:27] story is, right? We're probably not
[1:16:29] going to read it today, but there was
[1:16:30] strife between the herdsmen. And why is
[1:16:32] that? Naturally speaking, you can say
[1:16:35] there wasn't enough to go around to feed
[1:16:36] all the animals. But we know spiritually
[1:16:39] speaking, the natural types the
[1:16:41] spiritual.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; When we start to feel a little bit of
[1:16:44] pressure in a natural realm, it can
[1:16:47] actually be dealing with a spiritual
[1:16:50] level in a person's life. And it isn't
[1:16:53] always, but we know in this particular
[1:16:54] case, it was for sure.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; It was definitely a spiritual matter.
[1:16:59] And Lot had to separate himself from
[1:17:02] Abram. Better yet, Abram had to separate
[1:17:05] himself from Lot because Lot was just
[1:17:07] along for the ride. And we know that
[1:17:09] Abram's brother had died. He passed away
[1:17:12] and he felt for his nephew. He wanted to
[1:17:14] look after him. But that wasn't
[1:17:16] according to the word of God. So, he had
[1:17:18] to actually separate himself. And once
[1:17:20] he did, then he began to hear from God
[1:17:22] again.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; And here we are in the situation of of
[1:17:26] him hearing from God. But, you know, in
[1:17:28] in in in light of our our day today,
[1:17:31] we're we're having the communion service
[1:17:32] tonight. I I wanted to talk a little bit
[1:17:34] about communion, and there's many
[1:17:36] different angles we could go to, and I'm
[1:17:38] probably not going to try and keep us
[1:17:39] here late today, so we'll just see how
[1:17:41] this goes. But talking about communion,
[1:17:44] and and being in the spirit of
[1:17:46] communion, I think it's a wonderful
[1:17:48] thought to be in the spirit of
[1:17:50] communion, don't you? to think that we
[1:17:53] have the ability to actually meet with
[1:17:56] Melzdc exactly like Abram did. And
[1:18:00] everyone, I'm sure, would say, "Well,
[1:18:02] it's probably going to be the deacons at
[1:18:03] the front and maybe Brother Barry's
[1:18:05] going to be here." But if that's all
[1:18:07] we're seeing, if that's all we're
[1:18:08] anticipating, we're missing the point,
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Because the word of God says to discern
[1:18:13] the Lord's body.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; And I think it's a beautiful thing. And
[1:18:17] I found a quote like I usually do, but I
[1:18:20] found a quote where brother Bradom he
[1:18:22] speaks specifically
[1:18:24] to the Lord's body. Discerning the
[1:18:26] Lord's body. It's in Cood. You can go
[1:18:28] and find it and I didn't want to bring
[1:18:29] it because it's kind of a little
[1:18:31] different angle this morning. I might
[1:18:33] tonight, but brother Bradom, he talks
[1:18:34] about it in Cood. The bride's body is
[1:18:38] actually discerning the body. Discerning
[1:18:41] the Lord's body is specifically the
[1:18:44] bride's body. That's exactly the quote
[1:18:45] brother Brandham says. I wasn't going to
[1:18:47] bring it, but I find myself doing it.
[1:18:49] It's amazing. But uh in the spirit of
[1:18:51] communion is what I want to talk about
[1:18:54] today. And you know, true communion
[1:18:56] isn't just coming and mechanically going
[1:18:58] through the motions.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; It's not just saying that I've come and
[1:19:02] I've done my deed. I I I came and and I
[1:19:06] I I I was a part I witnessed the the
[1:19:08] Holy Eucharist and I I I did things
[1:19:11] according to the way our church does it.
[1:19:13] And it's just coming and and discerning
[1:19:15] the Lord's body and and taking a few
[1:19:17] minutes and reading the scripture and
[1:19:19] then maybe we'll we'll have some wine.
[1:19:21] We'll drink a little bit of wine and eat
[1:19:22] a little bit of the bread and and then
[1:19:24] we go home and we did our duty. If
[1:19:26] that's what's going on, we're missing
[1:19:28] the point entirely.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Entirely. That is not it.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; It's all about realizing that the blood
[1:19:37] is the wine,
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; the bread is the body. This is exactly
[1:19:42] what Jesus instructed. His very last
[1:19:45] meal on this side, the very last taste
[1:19:48] of food that he had on this side of
[1:19:50] eternity in his corporal body was the
[1:19:53] communion supper, the last supper. And
[1:19:55] he instructed his disciples to do this
[1:20:00] all the while until he actually returns.
[1:20:03] So, I want to talk about the spirit of
[1:20:05] communion today and how true communion
[1:20:07] really is only through the leadership by
[1:20:10] the spirit. And uh I I just I've
[1:20:12] probably mentioned it in the past, but I
[1:20:14] think it's a a fascinating discussion
[1:20:16] when you look at the message of the
[1:20:17] hour. And is it any accident that the
[1:20:20] very last message that brother Brandham
[1:20:22] preached was communion?
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; The very last one. But what was the
[1:20:27] message just before that?
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; It was leadership.
[1:20:32] leadership was before communion.
[1:20:35] And you know, I personally believe this.
[1:20:37] This is brother Barry's view and I think
[1:20:38] it's real important because it's my
[1:20:40] view. No, I think it's important because
[1:20:42] it's the word of God. We're not going to
[1:20:44] have true communion unless we are
[1:20:46] actually led by the spirit.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; If we're not led by the spirit, if we're
[1:20:51] just doing it out of duty, then we're
[1:20:53] actually not truly having communion.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; So that's what I want to talk about
[1:20:58] today is is being led by the spirit. We
[1:21:01] we we want to get in the spirit of
[1:21:03] things. I think it's so good brother
[1:21:04] Paul said that, you know, talking about
[1:21:06] getting in the spirit. We could get in
[1:21:07] the spirit of the ball game in this
[1:21:09] world. You know, the Canadian team is
[1:21:11] actually going to the World Series.
[1:21:12] They're in the World Series. Yeah.
[1:21:16] But when we get to church, what's going
[1:21:17] on?
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Are we afraid to get excited?
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; I I'll say this. Are we afraid to get a
[1:21:23] little tempo? Are we afraid to actually
[1:21:25] move our feet? Are we afraid to dance in
[1:21:28] the spirit? It's wonder wonderful to
[1:21:30] think about other people doing it and
[1:21:31] and getting to that place, but what
[1:21:33] about us?
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; What are we going to do when we're the
[1:21:36] ones in heaven realizing that we were
[1:21:39] hanging over hell by a a link in a
[1:21:42] chain? Our souls were hanging over hell.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't anything that we did. It
[1:21:47] was just the grace of God that said, "I
[1:21:49] want that link and I want that link and
[1:21:51] I want that link and that link right
[1:21:53] there." But all the rest of them, they
[1:21:55] fall down into hell.
[1:21:59] I can tell you one thing. I I I'm not a
[1:22:02] gymnast, but I'll be doing back flips.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; I'll be shouting. I'll be screaming. I
[1:22:09] will be so thankful. But, you know, I
[1:22:12] don't want to wait till I'm there.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; I want to give them praise here. Like we
[1:22:17] say many times, this is our opportunity
[1:22:19] to practice our our most important
[1:22:22] special of our lives. Cuz when we get
[1:22:24] over there, all heaven's going to be
[1:22:26] quiet to hear our special, to hear the
[1:22:28] redeemed, praise the Lord. Oh my, that's
[1:22:31] going to be a tremendous thing.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; But you know, leadership is only going
[1:22:35] to happen the way that it's supposed to
[1:22:36] is if it is leadership by the spirit.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; And it always goes back to the spirit.
[1:22:42] All of the roads go back to the spirit.
[1:22:45] Especially when brother Barry's
[1:22:46] preaching, you got to get the Holy
[1:22:47] Ghost. If we don't get the Holy Ghost,
[1:22:48] then we're only living off of somebody
[1:22:50] else's experience,
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; right? Yes,
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; we can have a tremendous atmosphere in
[1:22:54] the building, but what good is it if
[1:22:56] it's not us bringing that atmosphere? If
[1:22:58] it's not us participating in that
[1:23:00] atmosphere. True communion is only going
[1:23:02] to be by the leadership of the spirit.
[1:23:04] And it's not just leadership by the
[1:23:06] spirit. This is where it gets really
[1:23:08] good, brothers and sisters, because I
[1:23:10] would say leadership by the spirit is is
[1:23:12] right up until the Isuza Street revival.
[1:23:16] The whole entire thing that happened in
[1:23:17] 1906, but then there was a mighty move
[1:23:21] of God. Not just speaking in tongues and
[1:23:23] an outpouring of the spirit. We know
[1:23:24] that happened in in in Ashbury. Was that
[1:23:27] down in the states just recently there
[1:23:29] was another outpouring of the spirit in
[1:23:30] a in a in a college and the news was
[1:23:33] covering it and everyone was excited
[1:23:34] about it. But what about the vindication
[1:23:37] of a vindicated prophet? What about God
[1:23:39] coming down and actually issuing a
[1:23:42] prophetic utterance to the age in which
[1:23:44] we are living in now?
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just leadership by the
[1:23:48] spirit, but by by the person of Jesus
[1:23:53] Christ now living out through his bride.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; His bride body actually manifesting in
[1:24:00] his body. And I know that gets a little
[1:24:03] bit tense sometimes to even talk like
[1:24:06] that
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; because it takes the onus off of
[1:24:09] everyone else and it puts it right on us
[1:24:11] to think how could I be that literal
[1:24:13] body? But we are his literal body.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. on earth.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; We are the manifestation of the word for
[1:24:19] our day.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; We sing that song. We are the word made
[1:24:23] flesh today. That's what the scriptures
[1:24:25] say.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Our names are seen within.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Redeemed and what?
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Perfect without sin.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; We are anointed. My
[1:24:39] I think it's wonderful.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; But we actually are manifesting his body
[1:24:43] to this world. So it goes from just
[1:24:46] being led by the spirit a and and and
[1:24:49] following the leadership of the Lord to
[1:24:51] actually being
[1:24:54] the Lord. Being the manifestation of his
[1:24:58] spirit to this world. Now I know it
[1:25:00] sounded crazy. I'm not saying that we're
[1:25:02] God. But if you've got the Holy Ghost in
[1:25:04] you, who are you?
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; He's not cohabitating with anyone.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; I think it's really important, really,
[1:25:15] really important to make sure that we
[1:25:17] know exactly where we stand.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; And and you know, we're not we're not
[1:25:22] interested in looking at at at the
[1:25:24] future and saying that, you know,
[1:25:25] somewhere way out there it's going to
[1:25:27] get really good. It's going to be so
[1:25:28] much better, even though it will be and
[1:25:30] and it's going to be. We're we know
[1:25:32] that's going to happen. But looking back
[1:25:33] and saying, you know, the the ministry
[1:25:35] of William Brham and if we could have
[1:25:37] just been in the meetings and seeing all
[1:25:38] the signs and wonders that took place,
[1:25:40] what about today? What about today?
[1:25:43] Isn't he the same yesterday, today, and
[1:25:44] forever? Hebrews 13:8 applies or it
[1:25:47] doesn't. But we're not looking at
[1:25:49] historical version of communion today.
[1:25:53] Even though we are even though we are,
[1:25:55] we're starting with the scripture in
[1:25:56] Genesis. I know. I know. Genesis chapter
[1:26:00] 14 talking about how we have Abram. He
[1:26:04] hasn't had a name change yet, but we
[1:26:06] know that he's on a journey. The Lord is
[1:26:08] leading him.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; But what what I want to get to a little
[1:26:11] bit today is understanding that when we
[1:26:14] take communion, what's actually taking
[1:26:16] place?
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; What's going on when we take communion?
[1:26:20] As we mentioned already, is it just the
[1:26:22] duty? Is it a civic duty? Is it our
[1:26:24] religious duty to just come and take the
[1:26:26] bread and to take the wine and or or is
[1:26:29] it more? I I believe it's a whole lot
[1:26:31] more.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; We're actually following the direct
[1:26:35] leadership of Jesus Christ who is God in
[1:26:39] flesh.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Breaking the bread for his brothers.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Breaking the wine into the cup and
[1:26:45] pouring it out and and giving it to them
[1:26:47] and saying, "Take, drink. This cup is my
[1:26:50] blood."
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. And they had no idea what was going
[1:26:54] on.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; The disciples didn't. But can you
[1:26:58] imagine Jesus in the moment knowing what
[1:27:00] was going to happen?
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:27:03] But understanding when we take
[1:27:05] communion, what's actually taking place?
[1:27:07] We're discerning the Lord's body.
[1:27:10] And you know, we have the opportunity
[1:27:11] when we're discerning the Lord's body to
[1:27:13] actually search our hearts to say,
[1:27:16] "Lord, is there anything inside of me
[1:27:19] that would hinder this blessing from
[1:27:22] coming upon me?" Because we know that
[1:27:24] the word says that many are sick and
[1:27:26] weakly among you. Why? Because they fail
[1:27:28] to discern the Lord's body before they
[1:27:31] take communion.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be sick and weekly, do
[1:27:36] we? None of us do. And I know I've been
[1:27:39] sick and weakly. And I'll say it this
[1:27:40] way a little bit in my body, but mostly
[1:27:42] in my soul, mostly in my spirit because
[1:27:45] I've come and done it. I'll tell you,
[1:27:47] I've come and done it out of a duty
[1:27:50] without the revelation about what's
[1:27:51] really going on. Sometimes we get into a
[1:27:54] little bit of a we'll call it a funk
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; in our lives. We can get there and we
[1:27:59] just sort of put one foot in front of
[1:28:01] the other, one foot in front of the
[1:28:02] other. But you know, there's more. We
[1:28:05] don't have to live in that state. That
[1:28:07] is not the state where God wants us to
[1:28:09] be.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; We know his word says that he would that
[1:28:13] we would prosper and be in good health.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Not being sick and and and weekly.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; So today, brothers and sisters, let's
[1:28:23] bring it right down home today. Where is
[1:28:25] the Lord's body?
[1:28:28] Where is the Lord's body?
[1:28:30] We know that the Lord's body is the
[1:28:32] bride.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; The bride is the Lord's body.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when we take communion, we
[1:28:37] know the wine represents his blood. And
[1:28:40] we know the bread represents his body.
[1:28:42] The wine represents the blood that was
[1:28:44] shed.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; The body the bread represents the body
[1:28:49] that was broken for us.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; And I think it's so amazing because if
[1:28:53] we think about it, every time when we
[1:28:55] take communion, if we can just remember
[1:28:57] it maybe tonight when we pray about it,
[1:28:59] when you hear that bread cracking, think
[1:29:02] about the Lord's body.
[1:29:04] Not one of his bones was broken, but
[1:29:07] sure, he sure took the stripes, didn't
[1:29:09] he? But why did he take those stripes?
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; For our healing,
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; not so that we could be sick and weakly.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; No, so that we could actually be
[1:29:19] thoroughly healed.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; But I think, you know, brothers and
[1:29:22] sisters, I just want to encourage us. I
[1:29:24] know it was a tremendous start to the
[1:29:25] service today. And I just think it's so
[1:29:27] good. It's exactly what brother Paul
[1:29:29] said. You know, in the world, people get
[1:29:31] into the spirit of things. And I just
[1:29:34] want to encourage us to get into the
[1:29:35] spirit of communion to to really really
[1:29:38] realize what it means. And and for us,
[1:29:41] you know, many times I'll just say it
[1:29:42] because I'm a pastor. I have to many
[1:29:44] times we'll see the church full to to
[1:29:46] this morning. But when communion service
[1:29:48] happens, it's half full. Half the people
[1:29:51] aren't here. Half the people that claim
[1:29:52] to believe the message of the hour that
[1:29:53] it's not a communion. And I don't know
[1:29:56] why. Is it because your heart condemns
[1:29:58] you? I want to say just get right with
[1:30:00] God. Just ask him. Forgive me if that's
[1:30:03] the case. Does half of the body work? I
[1:30:06] don't know. I don't know. I just want to
[1:30:07] encourage us. Don't miss out on
[1:30:09] communion. It's one of the most
[1:30:10] important services that we could ever
[1:30:11] do. And you know why? Because there's
[1:30:13] another part to it. Another part that's
[1:30:15] really really important. And that is the
[1:30:17] footwashing portion. The footwashing
[1:30:20] portion. That's that's weird. Many
[1:30:22] people would say that's so bizarre and
[1:30:23] weird. But you know, the Bible says
[1:30:25] happy are they that do these things.
[1:30:28] Happy are ye if you do these things. So,
[1:30:31] how could we just overlook it? Many
[1:30:33] times people will say, "Well, it was for
[1:30:34] a different uh culture because people
[1:30:37] wore sandals that were open and they
[1:30:39] walked on dirty streets." And sure
[1:30:40] enough, it was. But for Jesus to say
[1:30:43] that you ought to do these things,
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; u we to do it if he said, "Do it."
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; We know that's the trick of the devil in
[1:30:51] the age in which we live. You don't have
[1:30:52] to do that. You know, you you you won't
[1:30:55] die. No, you won't surely die. It'll be
[1:30:58] okay. You don't have to take communion.
[1:31:00] You don't have to go to church on
[1:31:01] Wednesday nights. You don't have to go
[1:31:02] early according to what the prophet
[1:31:04] said. You don't have to do any of that.
[1:31:06] You can worship the way that you want.
[1:31:08] When we start doing that, we let the
[1:31:09] things slip,
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Things begin to slip in our lives. And
[1:31:13] you know what we do is we rob ourselves
[1:31:15] from the power of God living out through
[1:31:17] our lives, manifesting in our lives, and
[1:31:19] before long, we find ourselves weak and
[1:31:22] sickly.
[1:31:23] You know, brother Brandham, he says it I
[1:31:25] I think I'll say it this way that the
[1:31:26] spirit says it through brother Brandham
[1:31:29] every time we listen or we read the
[1:31:31] church age book. He says don't go
[1:31:34] through the acts first. Don't go through
[1:31:37] the acts first. Don't come and take
[1:31:38] communion first. Don't don't just go to
[1:31:40] church first. Even though you should go
[1:31:42] to church. We have the conversation
[1:31:44] earlier today. Come as you are.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Come as you are. Come and get washed by
[1:31:48] the water of the word.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:51] But don't don't just go through the acts
[1:31:53] first. Get in the spirit
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; and then go through the acts
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; and watch what God will do.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Now, if this is what brother Brandham
[1:32:04] was saying, I think it's wonderful
[1:32:05] because you could see the prophet of God
[1:32:07] saying, you know, just just do it this
[1:32:09] way and just see what will happen. But
[1:32:11] if this is truly inspired word of God
[1:32:14] through a vindicated prophet, if this is
[1:32:16] a prophetic utterance saying this, then
[1:32:18] this isn't a man saying it. It's God
[1:32:20] saying, "Don't go through the acts
[1:32:21] first. Get in the spirit and then go
[1:32:25] through the acts and watch what God will
[1:32:28] do."
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; And I'll say it this way and watch what
[1:32:32] I will do.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; If it's God speaking, just watch what I
[1:32:36] will do. Come to church half an hour
[1:32:38] early. Try going to church. Sacrifice
[1:32:41] whatever it takes to go to church on
[1:32:43] Wednesday night and see if God won't
[1:32:44] pour out a blessing that you can't even
[1:32:46] contain.
[1:32:48] Tithing isn't all about money. Many
[1:32:50] times we go there and we say it's all
[1:32:51] about money and I'm going to give a
[1:32:52] certain percentage and I want to see the
[1:32:54] the golden doors in heaven open up and
[1:32:57] fill up my storehouses so they're full
[1:32:59] and No, no, no, no, no.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Do something else. Try and give God
[1:33:03] something different to honor and see if
[1:33:05] he won't.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; But don't go through the acts first. Get
[1:33:09] in the spirit first. Come to church half
[1:33:10] an hour early. Come to church earlier
[1:33:13] than the deacons.
[1:33:15] upset the deacons a little bit.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Come to church early and get in the
[1:33:20] spirit first
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; like we've already heard and see what
[1:33:24] happens. See what God will do. We know
[1:33:26] in this very church, in this very
[1:33:28] building, God manifested in such a way
[1:33:31] in a regular Wednesday night service
[1:33:33] where a woman was healed of cancer, a
[1:33:35] sister was healed of breast cancer. The
[1:33:38] word of God came to her in the middle of
[1:33:40] the song service, just in the middle of
[1:33:42] the song service and says, "Stand up and
[1:33:44] receive your healing."
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; And what'd she do?
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; She did.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; And what happened? God did. It's so
[1:33:53] beautiful.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; But don't go through the acts first. We
[1:33:56] can get so hung up on just trying to go
[1:33:59] through the acts. You know, we've got
[1:34:01] all the mechanics. All of the mechanics.
[1:34:04] We're talking about the old-timers in
[1:34:06] the message. and you know how they've
[1:34:08] seen it all. They've they've witnessed
[1:34:10] all the winds of doctrine and all the
[1:34:12] different ways of doing things.
[1:34:15] They've seen the mechanics from every
[1:34:18] single angle. I think it would be
[1:34:20] beautiful to just sit down and
[1:34:22] fellowship with them with some coffee
[1:34:24] and no time limit. But you know, many
[1:34:28] times I think that we we we can get so
[1:34:30] hung up on the mechanics and it becomes
[1:34:32] a legalistic perspective on what we're
[1:34:34] doing. We need to just get into the
[1:34:36] spirit and see what God will do because
[1:34:39] he wants to do way more than I think
[1:34:41] we're ready for many times.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; You know, talking about our scripture
[1:34:46] today, verse 18 of Genesis chapter 14,
[1:34:49] it was only after Abram, he heard there
[1:34:53] was trouble. He heard there was trouble.
[1:34:55] He heard that this sodomite condition
[1:34:59] attracted his nephew and his nephew was
[1:35:01] down there and he wasn't happy about it.
[1:35:03] And I can't help but think he just had
[1:35:05] an opportunity in his own heart to go
[1:35:07] and deliver his nephew from the clutches
[1:35:09] of this evil.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; But here he's captured and taken
[1:35:14] captive. And what did Abram do? We know
[1:35:17] that he chased the men. He chased the
[1:35:20] kings. He chased them until he actually
[1:35:22] got them. And we know that in verse 14,
[1:35:24] he says that he pursued them unto Dan.
[1:35:26] And brother Brandham, he brings it out
[1:35:28] in the message. He says that this is to
[1:35:29] the uttermost part. He went as far as he
[1:35:32] could possibly go, as far as he had to
[1:35:35] go. He got the job done. He went for his
[1:35:38] nephew. And brother Brandham, I believe
[1:35:39] he brings it out and he says, "Are we
[1:35:41] willing to do that for our brother and
[1:35:42] for our sister?"
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Are pastors willing to do that for their
[1:35:46] sheep? Are we willing to chase them to
[1:35:48] the uttermost parts?
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Bring it on. Yes.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Even when they're living in sin in a
[1:35:53] sodom condition,
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; What a terrible thing. Or do we just
[1:35:58] say, "Oh my, we don't want to get
[1:36:01] infected. We don't want to go anywhere
[1:36:02] near that." You know what? We're living
[1:36:04] in the midst of it.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; We can't help it.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; This condition that we're living in,
[1:36:09] this this age that we're living in is
[1:36:11] rampant with the Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:36:14] condition.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; It is absolutely rampant with it. And
[1:36:18] there's no escaping it.
[1:36:20] But verse 18,
[1:36:23] after the battle, after he went and slew
[1:36:27] the king, after he went and delivered
[1:36:29] his nephew, verse 18, and Melzdc, king
[1:36:32] of Salem, brought forth bread and wine,
[1:36:37] and he was priest of the most high God.
[1:36:38] And he blessed him and said, "Blessed be
[1:36:41] Abram of the most high God, possessor of
[1:36:44] heavens and earth."
[1:36:46] I just think, Lord, would you ever say
[1:36:48] that about me?
[1:36:50] Would you ever say those words about me?
[1:36:52] Could I ever fit that description? I
[1:36:54] just want to fit that description. Don't
[1:36:56] you today?
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; And he blessed him and said, "Blessed be
[1:36:59] Abram of the most high God, possessor of
[1:37:03] heaven and earth." You know, if you are
[1:37:04] elect of God, you do fit that
[1:37:06] description.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; We fit that description right there. We
[1:37:10] could put our name right there.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Verse 20. and blessed be the most high
[1:37:15] God which hath delivered thine enemies
[1:37:17] into thine hand.
[1:37:20] And he gave them tithes of all.
[1:37:23] He didn't give them tithes of some.
[1:37:25] There wasn't just a portion allocated.
[1:37:28] An exact to the penny mathematical
[1:37:31] formula calculated.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; No. No. It says he gave him tithes of
[1:37:35] all.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; All all of it because he knew where it
[1:37:38] came from.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; He knew exactly where it came from. And
[1:37:42] I I just want to say if you ever want to
[1:37:45] see God bless you, just just just don't
[1:37:47] be tight with it. See what he does.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; He will always always bless you. Let's
[1:37:55] turn over to Hebrews chapter 5 this
[1:37:58] morning talking about Melzdc.
[1:38:07] Hebrews chapter 5.
[1:38:13] talking about mazesc and the spirit of
[1:38:15] communion.
[1:38:17] Hebrews chapter 5 verse 6.
[1:38:24] as he saith also in another place,
[1:38:29] thou art a priest forever
[1:38:33] after the order of Melzdc,
[1:38:36] who in the days of his flesh,
[1:38:39] when he had offered up prayers and
[1:38:42] supplications
[1:38:44] with strong crying and tears unto him
[1:38:46] that was able to save him from death,
[1:38:50] and was heard in that he feared.
[1:38:54] Though he were a son,
[1:38:57] yet learned he obedience
[1:39:00] by the things which he suffered.
[1:39:03] And being made perfect, he became the
[1:39:06] author of eternal salvation unto all
[1:39:09] them that obey him.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; God called of God and high priest after
[1:39:15] the order of Melzdc.
[1:39:18] And we know what the order of Melzdc is.
[1:39:22] It's out without father, without mother,
[1:39:25] without beginning of days or ending of
[1:39:27] life where there's no descent. There's
[1:39:29] no tracing back the lineage of this man.
[1:39:32] Why is that? Because this man is not
[1:39:35] like any other man.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; This man that we just read about is
[1:39:40] after the order of Melzdc. This man is
[1:39:42] Jesus Christ.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; And so I think it's so beautiful. I know
[1:39:46] brother Brandham refers to it in the
[1:39:47] message when Abram actually received
[1:39:50] that bread and that wine. Who was it
[1:39:52] that actually ministered that bread and
[1:39:54] that wine to him? Now, some would say
[1:39:56] there's no way that could be Jesus
[1:39:58] Christ. And I'm not going to say it was,
[1:40:01] but I am going to say it was Jesus
[1:40:04] Christ in spirit. I think it was though
[1:40:07] the same man that did it. I think it's
[1:40:09] so beautiful.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; We can see it. We know it. But we know
[1:40:13] in this scripture here that we're
[1:40:14] reading is speaking specifically about
[1:40:17] Jesus Christ. Verse six says, "As he
[1:40:20] saith in another place, thou art a
[1:40:23] priest forever after the order of
[1:40:25] Melzdc." We know that Melzdc referring
[1:40:28] to in the story in Genesis verse 7 here
[1:40:31] who in the days of his flesh when he
[1:40:33] offered up prayers and supplications
[1:40:35] with strong crying and tears unto him
[1:40:37] that was able to save him from death.
[1:40:41] He wasn't about to die. That that one in
[1:40:43] Genesis and and he wasn't offering up
[1:40:47] strong prayers and tears because he
[1:40:52] feared that he was going to die. He
[1:40:54] wasn't actually a son
[1:40:56] that he needed to learn obedience by the
[1:40:59] things which he suffered.
[1:41:01] He was Melzdc. But this scripture here
[1:41:04] is speaking very specifically about
[1:41:06] Jesus Christ in the order of Melzdc. I
[1:41:09] think it's a beautiful beautiful thing
[1:41:11] when we look at this recognizing this is
[1:41:14] about communion.
[1:41:16] Though he were a son yet learned he
[1:41:19] obedience by the things which he
[1:41:21] suffered. And verse nine says, "And
[1:41:24] being made perfect, he became the author
[1:41:26] of eternal salvation unto all them that
[1:41:31] obey him."
[1:41:33] So I was looking up this word perfect.
[1:41:35] It's G5048
[1:41:37] pronounced tali u
[1:41:41] and it says to complete literally
[1:41:44] accomplish or figuratively
[1:41:47] consumate in character
[1:41:50] consecrate finish fulfill
[1:41:54] make perfect.
[1:41:56] I just want to throw in a word here,
[1:41:58] maybe a a an adjective for this word
[1:42:01] perfect. And yet and being yet made
[1:42:06] not perfect but yet perfect. Being made
[1:42:10] mature,
[1:42:12] being made adopted,
[1:42:15] being made perfect, he became the author
[1:42:17] of eternal salvation unto all them that
[1:42:20] obey him. Called of God and high priest
[1:42:24] after the order of Melzdc.
[1:42:26] Just thinking about this man, Melzdc.
[1:42:29] Who is this man? Let's turn over to
[1:42:31] Hebrews chapter 7.
[1:42:35] Hebrews chapter 7.
[1:42:38] Talks a bit about the scripture that we
[1:42:40] read this morning in Genesis. Hebrews
[1:42:43] chapter 7.
[1:42:46] We know this was a letter that Paul
[1:42:47] wrote to the Hebrews.
[1:42:50] For this Melzdc, verse one, being king
[1:42:52] of Salem, priest of the most high God,
[1:42:54] who met Abraham,
[1:42:57] returning from the slaughter of the
[1:42:59] kings, and blessed him,
[1:43:02] to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part
[1:43:05] of all, first being by interpretation
[1:43:09] king of righteousness, and after that
[1:43:10] also king of Salem, which is king of
[1:43:13] peace,
[1:43:15] without father, without mother, without
[1:43:17] descent, having neither beginning of
[1:43:19] days, nor ending of life, but being made
[1:43:22] like unto the Son of God, abideth a
[1:43:26] priest continually.
[1:43:29] Now consider how great this man was,
[1:43:32] unto whom even the patriarch Abraham
[1:43:35] gave the tenth of the spoils.
[1:43:39] And verily they that are of the sons of
[1:43:42] Levi, who receive the office of the
[1:43:44] priesthood, have a commandment to take
[1:43:46] the tithes of the people according to
[1:43:49] the law, that is of their brethren,
[1:43:52] though they come out of the loins of
[1:43:53] Abraham.
[1:43:55] I think it's so beautiful what he gets
[1:43:57] at here. But he whose descent is not
[1:43:59] counted from them received tithes of
[1:44:02] Abraham and blessed him that had the
[1:44:05] promises.
[1:44:06] And without all contradiction, the less
[1:44:09] is blessed of the better.
[1:44:13] And here men that die receiveth tithes
[1:44:16] receive tithes. But there he receiveth
[1:44:19] them of whom it is witnessed that he
[1:44:23] liveth.
[1:44:25] And as I may so say, Levi also who
[1:44:30] receiveth tithes
[1:44:32] paid tithes
[1:44:34] in Abraham.
[1:44:37] For he was yet in the loins of his
[1:44:40] father when Melzdc met him.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; If therefore perfection were by the
[1:44:47] Levitical priesthood, for under it if
[1:44:51] the people received the law, what
[1:44:53] further need was there that another
[1:44:55] priest should rise after the order of
[1:44:58] Melzdc and not be called after the order
[1:45:01] of Aaron?
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; I think it's just amazing. I don't want
[1:45:05] to read any more in here. I'm not going
[1:45:07] to go further with it because it uh will
[1:45:10] just take us in another direction. But I
[1:45:11] think it's just amazing to look at this
[1:45:13] to recognize paying tithes is way more
[1:45:18] than simply what's in it for me.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; And when you see a ministry that's
[1:45:24] pulling on money continually, that's
[1:45:25] just a a it's not a good ministry
[1:45:29] either. That's not the ministry of the
[1:45:31] Lord. But to understand that when we pay
[1:45:33] a tithe unto the Lord and maybe it's of
[1:45:35] our time because I'm not pulling on
[1:45:38] money. Maybe it is of money. Maybe it's
[1:45:40] of something that we do. Maybe it's
[1:45:42] prayer. Whatever it is, when we pay a
[1:45:44] tithe, truly a tithe is of money. But
[1:45:46] when we do pay a tithe, we're not
[1:45:48] looking for a blessing for ourselves.
[1:45:50] What about for our children?
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; What about for our children's children?
[1:45:55] Like Levi in the loins of Abraham. He
[1:45:58] paid tithes. How could he do that in the
[1:46:00] loins of Abraham? It's a beautiful
[1:46:03] thing. He's not in the in the lineage of
[1:46:06] man at that point. It is the elected of
[1:46:10] God that we're talking about. But when
[1:46:12] we pay tithes, we are actually seeing a
[1:46:15] blessing stored up in a different way
[1:46:17] than maybe what we can think about the
[1:46:19] way this world is set up to make us
[1:46:21] believe.
[1:46:23] You know, I I just want to read a quote
[1:46:25] out of perfection in 1956.
[1:46:28] Brother Brandham talking about this king
[1:46:29] of Salem, Melzdc.
[1:46:34] Who was the king of Salem?
[1:46:37] The great king of Jerusalem.
[1:46:40] Not the earthly, the heavenly.
[1:46:42] The earthly Jerusalem is a type of the
[1:46:46] heavenly.
[1:46:47] And here come the king of Salem, which
[1:46:50] is first the king of righteousness, the
[1:46:53] king of peace.
[1:46:56] He didn't have any father. He didn't
[1:46:58] have any mother. He didn't have
[1:46:59] beginning of life or ending of days. Oh
[1:47:02] my. Without disscent.
[1:47:05] None other than Christ himself.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Great.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; That's who the church meets when they go
[1:47:13] up in the air.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Now, I was studying this and I was just
[1:47:18] thinking about it. You know, that day is
[1:47:20] so close, brothers and sisters. Yes,
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; that day is so close
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; where that church, that group of people
[1:47:27] he's talking about are going to actually
[1:47:28] meet him in the clouds.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; It has never been closer.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; All of the signs and and and situations
[1:47:36] are actually in play right now. And we
[1:47:40] know that this is so far beyond what the
[1:47:42] prophet taught when he said, "There's
[1:47:44] only one I only see one thing left for
[1:47:46] the church of the living God,
[1:47:49] and that is for the rapture." But he
[1:47:51] says that's who's that's who the church
[1:47:55] meets when they go up in the air, none
[1:47:57] other than Christ himself. And when
[1:47:59] Abraham met him, he gave him the tithe
[1:48:03] of all that he possessed.
[1:48:06] You know what they did? The first thing
[1:48:09] they did was sat down. He says, "I feel
[1:48:12] really emotional." sat down and broke
[1:48:15] bread and drank wine and taken the
[1:48:19] communion
[1:48:20] after the battle was over.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; So, here's what I want to get to today,
[1:48:27] brothers and sisters, when we're in the
[1:48:30] midst of our lives and we're in the
[1:48:33] midst of our battles because we all have
[1:48:36] them. Some are great, some are small. We
[1:48:40] have different perspectives on different
[1:48:42] things in our lives, but when we're
[1:48:44] going through it, we're going through
[1:48:46] it. And it doesn't matter what anybody
[1:48:47] else thinks because we're the ones
[1:48:49] experiencing it. When we're going
[1:48:51] through the battle, I just want to
[1:48:53] encourage us that it's when the battle
[1:48:55] is over.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Melzdc is going to be there with you for
[1:48:59] communion.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Melzdc himself is going to bring the
[1:49:04] wine and the bread and say, "It's over.
[1:49:08] You don't have to fight anymore.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; You have ran the course. You have
[1:49:13] finished the race.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; My But brother Brandham's saying this as
[1:49:18] he's talking here. You know what they
[1:49:19] did? The first thing they did was sat
[1:49:21] down.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine this one who he's just
[1:49:26] said was none other than Jesus Christ.
[1:49:28] Sat down and broke bread and and poured
[1:49:32] out the wine. Can you imagine what kind
[1:49:33] of wine that must have been for all the
[1:49:35] wine connoisseurs in the congregation?
[1:49:40] And I know there's some people that
[1:49:41] drink wine for the stomach's sake. And
[1:49:43] you know, that's okay. It's a
[1:49:44] revelation. We drink wine for communion
[1:49:47] and that's about all. But you know,
[1:49:49] there's people that are huge wine
[1:49:51] connoisseurs. I can imagine this would
[1:49:53] be the best wine there ever was ever
[1:49:55] even thought about in the world because
[1:49:57] this was Jesus Christ offering it.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. Well, it might have been
[1:50:01] comparable, I guess, at the wedding
[1:50:03] feast, right? The first miracle of
[1:50:05] Jesus. It's probably the same same
[1:50:08] strain of wine. But you know what they
[1:50:11] did? The first thing they did was set
[1:50:13] down. He says, "I feel really
[1:50:16] emotional." And I just I personally
[1:50:18] can't help but think when you hear the
[1:50:19] prophet of God telling a story like this
[1:50:21] about something that actually took
[1:50:23] place, I just think that he must have
[1:50:24] been there. He must have witnessed it.
[1:50:26] He must have been able to visualize it
[1:50:28] through a vision, through the prophetic
[1:50:30] gift that he had. He was able to sat
[1:50:32] down and see this happen and and and sat
[1:50:35] down and see that the bread was broken
[1:50:37] and he drank the wine and took the
[1:50:39] communion. But it was after the battle
[1:50:40] was over. And the next paragraph says,
[1:50:42] "And the Bible tells us Jesus Christ did
[1:50:45] that we'll eat no more of the fruit of
[1:50:48] the vine until I eat a new with you in
[1:50:51] my father's kingdom."
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:54] that when the last battle is fought and
[1:50:57] I want to say brothers and sisters just
[1:50:59] any day now the very last battle is
[1:51:02] going to be fought
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; for the elected bride of Jesus Christ
[1:51:05] just any day now any moment now the very
[1:51:07] last battle is going to be fought in our
[1:51:10] lives let's not get weary in welloing
[1:51:12] let's fight hard while we have the
[1:51:14] ability through the baptism of the Holy
[1:51:16] Ghost to fight
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; that when the last battle is fought and
[1:51:20] the victory is won
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; I love how he says that not when the
[1:51:24] last battle's fought and you kind of
[1:51:26] lose and you go moping home. No, when
[1:51:28] the last battle is fought and won
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; and the waywards has been brought back
[1:51:34] to the kingdom of God. Why? Because
[1:51:37] we'll travel to the ends of the earth to
[1:51:39] go chase our brothers and our sisters
[1:51:41] who have gone wayward.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; I love how brother Brown talks about it
[1:51:45] in a message. I believe it's in
[1:51:47] adoption. Don't worry about those weward
[1:51:49] children. You just commit them to God.
[1:51:51] God will do the work in their lives.
[1:51:53] Amen.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; He goes on here to say that when the
[1:51:56] last battle is fought and the victory is
[1:51:58] won and the wayward's been brought back
[1:52:00] to the kingdom of God, we'll set down in
[1:52:02] the kingdom of God and with our Melzdc
[1:52:06] who has no beginning of days or ending
[1:52:08] of years. Oh my, he's the chainless
[1:52:11] eternal one.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Eat the communion again with him.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, I just want to say
[1:52:18] it. When we have communion tonight, this
[1:52:21] afternoon, whatever you want to call it,
[1:52:23] when we partake of the communion table,
[1:52:25] let's consider who is here with us.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Taking the communion.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; If we have the baptism of the Holy
[1:52:33] Ghost, which we ought to or we better
[1:52:34] not take communion,
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; because if we don't, if we're not led by
[1:52:38] the spirit, going full circle to what we
[1:52:39] said at the beginning, we need the
[1:52:41] baptism of the Holy Spirit to be
[1:52:43] partaking of this body. If we're not
[1:52:44] doing that, then we're just doing it out
[1:52:46] of motion. We're going through the
[1:52:47] motions.
[1:52:48] And that's not the way to take it
[1:52:50] because we're supposed to discern the
[1:52:51] Lord's body.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to say anyone does or
[1:52:55] doesn't. And I know some people will say
[1:52:57] you shouldn't let a child take communion
[1:52:59] before the age of 14 because it's not
[1:53:01] accountable. Or they probably be the
[1:53:04] same people that would say you should
[1:53:05] never let a child unless they're 16
[1:53:07] years of age go and get baptized in the
[1:53:09] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:53:10] remission of their sins so that they can
[1:53:12] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Both of which the prophet of God never
[1:53:17] said. Right.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; So, I want to say where did they come
[1:53:20] from?
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Yeah.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; And you know what? If we have a man's
[1:53:24] opinion, it's fine. I say my opinion
[1:53:26] many times, but it's like eating cherry
[1:53:28] pie. The prophet said, "If you're eating
[1:53:30] the pie and you're enjoying the pie and
[1:53:32] you get a pit, don't throw the pie out."
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Just throw the pit out.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; And and I would say just maybe what we
[1:53:39] could do is just politely take a napkin
[1:53:42] and just
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; and there goes the pit,
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:53:47] We don't have to
[1:53:49] cough it out and make a big hairy deal
[1:53:51] about it, do we?
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; No. Just take it out, put it down, and
[1:53:55] move on because we're brothers and
[1:53:56] sisters.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; We're all sons and daughters of God.
[1:54:00] We're all going to the same place. We're
[1:54:02] all fighting the same enemy, aren't we?
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; We are.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; You know, when we start fighting one
[1:54:07] another, we're giving the devil a day
[1:54:08] off. Who wants to give the devil a rest?
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Don't do his work.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Let's work for the kingdom of God. Amen.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; But you know, when we see these things,
[1:54:17] when we hear these things, where did
[1:54:18] they come from?
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; If they didn't come from the prophet of
[1:54:22] God, if they didn't come from the word
[1:54:23] of God, then they're irrelevant.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Even my opinion,
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; it's irrelevant. It doesn't matter.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; But when it's according to the word of
[1:54:34] God, we better listen.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; You know, I just think this is so good
[1:54:39] how we talk about Melzdc, the the one
[1:54:42] Jesus Christ himself. We just heard the
[1:54:44] prophet say it. You know, he was
[1:54:45] beginning of no beginning of days and no
[1:54:47] ending of life. This one, this one had
[1:54:50] to come himself and suffer. I I just
[1:54:55] struggle with this myself to even
[1:54:57] comprehend it. He came to suffer.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; He came to do miracles. He came to have
[1:55:02] a first and second pole of his ministry
[1:55:04] and a third pole of his ministry, but
[1:55:06] then to be taken off the scene in such a
[1:55:08] way that he would pay the price for my
[1:55:10] salvation. He was tempted in all points,
[1:55:14] wasn't he?
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; And he wasn't delivered from the
[1:55:19] temptation. What he did do was actually
[1:55:22] fought the temptation with the word of
[1:55:24] God.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Only by the word of God. That's the only
[1:55:27] way that he overcame. We know in Matthew
[1:55:29] chapter 4 after he went through the
[1:55:32] temptation,
[1:55:33] you know, the lust of the flesh, the
[1:55:34] lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.
[1:55:36] The three temptations that Satan came to
[1:55:38] him after he was hungered after 40 days
[1:55:40] of fasting.
[1:55:41] My verse 11 of Matthew chapter 4 says,
[1:55:44] "Then the devil leaveth him, and behold,
[1:55:48] angels came and ministered unto him."
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; I want to go back to the thought,
[1:55:53] brothers and sisters, once the battle is
[1:55:55] fought, once the battle is not just
[1:55:57] fought, but won. Once that battle is
[1:56:01] won, the angels will come and minister.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; They won't leave us or He won't leave us
[1:56:07] or forsake us. His angels are encamped
[1:56:09] about us. But we have to learn. If he
[1:56:11] had to come and learn things through the
[1:56:13] things that he suffered, are we going to
[1:56:15] be free? Are we going to be vacant of
[1:56:18] suffering in our lives?
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; We're going to have to suffer. We were
[1:56:22] talking about it yesterday. What what it
[1:56:24] would be like to not actually appreciate
[1:56:26] the things that we're going through in
[1:56:27] this life, but yet go and meet those
[1:56:29] virgins that had to have their breast
[1:56:32] cut off and slowly bleed out until they
[1:56:34] fell over. or the ones that had the tar
[1:56:37] put in their hair for sport in the
[1:56:40] stadiums and then have their hair lit on
[1:56:42] fire and just burn like a human torch to
[1:56:45] death. Or the families that claim
[1:56:48] Christianity, they claim to believe the
[1:56:50] message of the hour. And we know that
[1:56:53] the Romans said, "If that's what you
[1:56:54] don't want to renounce, then we're going
[1:56:56] to have to feed you to the lions."
[1:56:59] the moms and the dads and the children,
[1:57:03] all of those ones that gave their lives.
[1:57:05] We're going to go and stand and face
[1:57:07] those and say, "Oh, no, no, no, no. I I
[1:57:09] I just couldn't go through the suffering
[1:57:11] that I had to go through, the thing that
[1:57:12] I had to endure. No, it was just too
[1:57:15] much for me to No, no, no. The example
[1:57:19] that we talked about yesterday was how
[1:57:21] people were tied to a log. They were
[1:57:24] tied to a log and they were hung upside
[1:57:25] down on the log so that wild dogs could
[1:57:28] eat their bellies. I'm not saying this
[1:57:31] to try and make us sick. I'm trying to
[1:57:33] say, brothers and sisters, we're not
[1:57:34] going to go through this life unless we
[1:57:36] suffer just like he suffered just like
[1:57:39] they suffered.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; What happens when we suffer is we fight
[1:57:43] a battle.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; And when we fight the battle, we got to
[1:57:47] remember when we're fighting the battle,
[1:57:49] the battle's already won. We just have
[1:57:51] to endure to the end. Amen.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's not our battle.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; It's his battle.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; And he already won the battle.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; But when the battle's over, just like
[1:58:05] Jesus, it's scriptural in Matthew 4:11.
[1:58:08] Then the devil leaveth him. There comes
[1:58:09] a time where the devil's going to leave
[1:58:11] us.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; There comes a time where the devil's
[1:58:14] going to leave us. And and and I know
[1:58:17] that I could say names for for brothers
[1:58:19] and sisters who have gone through it,
[1:58:20] really gone through it, where the devil
[1:58:22] has just been on us and it feels like we
[1:58:25] just can't escape it. And the Lord will
[1:58:28] allow it to be that way.
[1:58:30] Boy, because he has a character inside
[1:58:33] of us
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; that he wants to bring out.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; And the only way that character is
[1:58:38] coming out is through the fiery trials
[1:58:40] in this life.
[1:58:42] But there's coming a time where the
[1:58:43] devil's going to leave us,
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; just like it left Jesus. And how did
[1:58:47] that happen? He overcame by the word.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; And as long as we're doing it the way
[1:58:52] that he instructed us to do it, the
[1:58:54] devil's going to leave us.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; In Luke 4:13, and when the devil had
[1:58:59] ended all the temptation, the devil's
[1:59:01] going to end the temptation with us.
[1:59:02] Don't worry. Just keep pressing on.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; That was the the instruction the prophet
[1:59:07] got from all the voices that were on the
[1:59:09] other side. Just keep pressing on.
[1:59:12] When the devil had ended all the
[1:59:14] temptation, he departed from him for a
[1:59:16] season. I just love this verse here.
[1:59:19] Verse 14 says, "And Jesus returned in
[1:59:22] the power of the spirit into Galilee. He
[1:59:25] didn't come back defeated because he had
[1:59:27] been tempted and he was hungered and he
[1:59:30] had to go through all the trials. He
[1:59:32] came back in the power of the spirit
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; after the trial." Amen.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; And there went out a fame of him
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; throughout all the region round about.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Now, brothers and sisters, I want to
[1:59:45] encourage us today if I can when we're
[1:59:47] going through the battle. If we can just
[1:59:50] stick with it.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Don't get weary in welloing. Understand
[1:59:54] the battle already has been won.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; We're going through the battle because
[1:59:58] he wants us to learn obedience through
[2:00:01] the things that we suffer. the things
[2:00:04] just like he had to go through. But boy
[2:00:06] oh boy, I just love the thought just
[2:00:09] like Jesus returned in the power of the
[2:00:11] spirit into Galilee after the battle was
[2:00:13] fought, after the angels came and
[2:00:15] ministered to him. The same thing as for
[2:00:17] us, brothers and sisters, when we go
[2:00:19] through the battles,
[2:00:21] God is going to come and actually
[2:00:23] minister to us
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; and and not just minister to us, but
[2:00:27] actually encourage us. We're going to
[2:00:29] have an encouragement because we're
[2:00:30] going to recognize we have allowed the
[2:00:32] Lord. We never did it. We just surrender
[2:00:34] to him to allow him to overcome whatever
[2:00:38] it is in our life that he wants us to
[2:00:40] overcome. Every one of us has something
[2:00:42] that we have to overcome. Every one of
[2:00:44] us has a punch coming from the devil.
[2:00:46] Don't we? That's what the prophet said.
[2:00:48] That's what God said through the
[2:00:49] prophet. Every one of us has a punch
[2:00:51] coming.
[2:00:53] I think it's amazing when we look at it
[2:00:55] because Jesus returned in the power of
[2:00:57] the spirit. I can't help but think we
[2:00:59] return in the power of the spirit after
[2:01:01] the battle has been fought. After the
[2:01:03] battle has been won. After we have
[2:01:05] communion in the spirit, communion
[2:01:07] through the spirit with the Lord Jesus
[2:01:09] Christ.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; I just want to say this that there went
[2:01:17] out a fame of him throughout the region
[2:01:19] all around roundabout.
[2:01:22] There will be and is a fame for all
[2:01:25] those who are actually battling the
[2:01:27] devil now
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; going through the battles in their own
[2:01:30] lives. All of our individual walks where
[2:01:33] we're struggling and we feel like we're
[2:01:35] not overcoming. You know, as long as
[2:01:37] we're fighting, as long as there's a
[2:01:39] struggle, you're overcoming. It's when
[2:01:41] you give in and there's no more
[2:01:43] struggle. That's when we've got a
[2:01:44] problem. I'll never forget brother Menow
[2:01:46] saying it the first time I ever heard
[2:01:48] it. That brother that that that said, "I
[2:01:50] just keep struggling. I just keep
[2:01:52] feeling like I can't overcome. I can't
[2:01:54] escape this temptation in my life. And
[2:01:57] brother brother Menow, he said it the
[2:01:58] first time I heard it. He said, "Do you
[2:02:00] still have a desire?" And he said,
[2:02:02] "Yeah, I do." And he said, "Well, there
[2:02:04] you go. You've got a benchmark. You got
[2:02:06] a place to go from.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; If you didn't have a desire, it would be
[2:02:10] over."
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; So, if we're in the midst of a battle,
[2:02:14] if we're in the midst of a trial today,
[2:02:15] brothers and sisters, we need to count
[2:02:17] it. more more precious than gold is what
[2:02:20] the word says.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; But when we come through the battle and
[2:02:24] when we go through the trial, when we
[2:02:26] learn obedience through the things that
[2:02:28] we're suffering, just think the devils
[2:02:31] are hearing the fame of God's success in
[2:02:35] your life. The devils all around you are
[2:02:37] going to hear a fame through the region
[2:02:40] roundabout about you, about how God can
[2:02:43] have success through you in your life.
[2:02:47] I just think it's amazing because we can
[2:02:48] see how God will do that and the devil
[2:02:52] will back off.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because Satan's busy. He's
[2:02:57] he's he's busy. He's a busy guy. He's a
[2:03:00] busy person. Uh maybe not a human, but a
[2:03:02] busy being, we'll say, right? A fallen
[2:03:05] angel. That's what he is.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; But he's busy. And so what does he do?
[2:03:09] He sends minions. He has people that he
[2:03:11] sends. And and can you think that if
[2:03:14] those minions keep coming around and
[2:03:16] keep not being able to win, keep not
[2:03:18] being able to have success? Well, they
[2:03:20] they were sent out to do send a
[2:03:22] temptation to to Benjamin Johnson. This
[2:03:24] temptation, I hope it's okay, buddy.
[2:03:27] This one thing that used to get him all
[2:03:28] the time. Suddenly, he just doesn't fall
[2:03:30] for it anymore.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Those devils aren't going to want to
[2:03:33] come and bother him because they're not
[2:03:35] going to have success.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; They're going to go and talk about
[2:03:38] what's going on. Now suddenly Benjamin
[2:03:40] he's overcoming in such a way like maybe
[2:03:43] he never did before and there's going to
[2:03:45] be a fame that goes round about in
[2:03:47] another dimension.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; You know I want to read a quote this
[2:03:54] morning just uh talking about Melzdc and
[2:03:58] and this idea of communion and and
[2:04:01] communion it only happens through
[2:04:03] leadership. If we're not being led, if
[2:04:05] we're not willing to be led according to
[2:04:06] the word of God, we can have all the
[2:04:08] motions, go through all the motions in
[2:04:10] our lives, and we're still not going to
[2:04:12] have communion.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; We're going to say it. We're going to
[2:04:15] we're going to maybe talk about it, but
[2:04:16] it's not going to be true spiritual
[2:04:19] communion. But what I want to talk about
[2:04:20] is a real life account. And we can read
[2:04:23] this here. I'm going to read it in the
[2:04:25] last little bit. It's amazing how time
[2:04:27] flies when you're having fun.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; 1965. Who is this Melzdc?
[2:04:32] How many ever seen the picture of that
[2:04:34] light? It's all over the country.
[2:04:36] Everywhere science has took it and
[2:04:38] examined it and everywhere. Now he is
[2:04:41] right here now.
[2:04:44] And I just going to say this, brothers
[2:04:45] and sisters. He's no different today, is
[2:04:47] he?
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Where two or three are gathered together
[2:04:50] in his name, he's there.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; We've already declared that we're
[2:04:54] gathered together in his name. Many
[2:04:56] people I know will say, "We hear this
[2:04:58] all the time, Brother Barry. Why do we
[2:04:59] got to go down this road?" because we
[2:05:01] all have needs. And I want to try and
[2:05:03] encourage us to recognize that we have
[2:05:05] the ability to see the very same success
[2:05:09] of God in our midst as they did here.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Even though we're talking about a
[2:05:16] vindicated prophet, but you know,
[2:05:18] brothers and sisters, if we just take it
[2:05:19] and put it off on a vindicated prophet
[2:05:21] and say that was only for the prophet,
[2:05:22] it's only going to be that way for the
[2:05:24] prophet, then we're missing the value,
[2:05:26] the entire value of the message of the
[2:05:28] hour. Because the entire message of the
[2:05:30] hour didn't come for the prophet. It
[2:05:33] came to the prophet
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; for the bride.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; So if we're the bride, then we are the
[2:05:39] full recipients of it. And if this is
[2:05:41] what was going on through the vindicated
[2:05:43] prophet, what ought to be going on
[2:05:45] through the bride today?
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; My he says science has took it and
[2:05:49] examined it everywhere. And now he's
[2:05:51] right here. Now I say the only
[2:05:53] difference between us and the vindicated
[2:05:55] prophet is he had the ability to see
[2:05:56] that light. Amen.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Because that light is either here right
[2:06:00] now or it's not.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; It's one or the other.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; Now he's right here now. Same one that
[2:06:09] said about marriage and divorce. Same
[2:06:10] one that was on the mountain, shook the
[2:06:12] hills back there. Same one that's down
[2:06:15] here at the river in 33. Same yesterday,
[2:06:18] today, and forever. He says it. He's the
[2:06:21] same.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; So, brothers and sisters, either he is
[2:06:24] or he isn't the same. Amen.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; Now, I I just felt so encouraged to get
[2:06:32] into this as I was feeling the desire to
[2:06:34] talk about the the communion that Melzdc
[2:06:38] brought Abraham and how it was only
[2:06:40] after the battle that he fought. You
[2:06:42] know, brothers and sisters, this might
[2:06:44] sound a little bit silly and some might
[2:06:46] remember me talking about this, but
[2:06:47] brother Pete Clawson was actually here
[2:06:50] in this meeting, right here in this
[2:06:52] meeting with William Brham. and and he
[2:06:55] would tell this story in such a vibrant
[2:06:58] way. And I know there was other brothers
[2:06:59] there. I think brother Mana was there.
[2:07:00] Brother George was there. I don't know
[2:07:02] the other brothers that were there, but
[2:07:04] there was other brothers and they were
[2:07:05] there. They they they just had this
[2:07:07] experience where they wanted to see the
[2:07:09] prophet of God. They were going for this
[2:07:11] series. They drove all the way to
[2:07:12] Jeffersonville from Saskatoon,
[2:07:14] Saskatchewan. And and here they were.
[2:07:17] They thought that the services weren't
[2:07:18] starting till the next day. And come to
[2:07:20] find out, the services were already on.
[2:07:22] And and what happened was they went to
[2:07:24] check it out in the door and it was
[2:07:25] full. And one of the deacons said, "We
[2:07:27] can actually get you in. You can go and
[2:07:29] sit right up near the front, but when we
[2:07:31] closed the meeting, you have to get up
[2:07:32] and leave right away because you're
[2:07:34] going to be in the emergency exit." And
[2:07:35] they said, "Okay." And they wound up
[2:07:37] getting right near the front row of this
[2:07:39] meeting, this meeting.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; Who is this Melzdc? And now I I just
[2:07:44] remember brother Pete Clawson describing
[2:07:45] this. Now there is a woman and she
[2:07:49] recognizes now that something has
[2:07:52] happened. So as I read this I just want
[2:07:54] to say brothers and sisters who was
[2:07:57] speaking
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; who was it that was speaking these
[2:08:01] words?
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; There was a man there was a voice but
[2:08:05] what was the sign behind the voice? Oh
[2:08:08] my. What was the voice behind the sign?
[2:08:11] Now there is a woman and she recognizes
[2:08:14] now that something has happened. That
[2:08:16] light is hanging right over her. She's
[2:08:18] sitting right here, green sweater on or
[2:08:22] something. I don't know the woman. I
[2:08:24] suppose we are strangers to one another.
[2:08:26] Is that right? Do you believe that God?
[2:08:29] you're in the need of something and you
[2:08:31] can believe that can and you believe
[2:08:34] that God can reveal to me what your
[2:08:37] trouble is and if he does then you'll
[2:08:40] know it'll have to be supernatural power
[2:08:43] because I don't know you and it'll have
[2:08:46] to come through supernatural.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; So when brother Pete was here, he would
[2:08:52] tell this story about how he could see
[2:08:54] that woman
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; wearing the green sweater. He could see
[2:08:58] the prophet talking about this and he
[2:09:01] had to wonder who was it that was
[2:09:03] speaking those words. Now he goes on to
[2:09:06] say depends upon what you think it is.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, he's the same
[2:09:13] yesterday, today, and forever. I want to
[2:09:15] take this story and bring it right up
[2:09:17] out of history and bring it right here
[2:09:18] today to Calvary Living Word Assembly
[2:09:21] for every single one of us in this
[2:09:23] building to contemplate.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is this just a historical event?
[2:09:28] Depends on what you think.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; Is it going to be somewhere out in the
[2:09:31] future? Depends on what you think. Is he
[2:09:34] here today the same yesterday, today,
[2:09:36] and forever? Depends on what you think.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; Depends on what you think it is. You can
[2:09:42] take your side with the priest, call it
[2:09:44] the devil
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; or brother Barry.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Or you can take the side with the
[2:09:49] believer and call it God.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; Whatever which you believe, that's where
[2:09:53] your reward will come from. Amen.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; I believe this is a fridge sticker
[2:10:00] quote.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; Depends on what you think it is.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; That's where your reward will come from.
[2:10:07] My goodness, help me to have the right
[2:10:09] perspective, Lord. If God will reveal to
[2:10:12] me your trouble, will you accept him as
[2:10:15] your atonement for that trouble?
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; I want to say it this morning. If you
[2:10:20] have trouble,
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; will you accept him as his atonement for
[2:10:24] your troubles?
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Because if you will, he is the same
[2:10:28] yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Depends on what we think about it,
[2:10:31] though, brothers and sisters.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Let's have the right mental attitude to
[2:10:35] any one of the promises of God. Because
[2:10:37] what will happen?
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; It'll bring it to pass.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; He says, "If God will reveal to me your
[2:10:44] trouble, will you accept him as your
[2:10:46] atonement for your trouble? I don't know
[2:10:48] what the trouble is, but I know and you
[2:10:51] know that something is going on. I think
[2:10:54] that's so beautiful. Imagine what that
[2:10:57] must have been like to be there
[2:10:58] witnessing that. But imagine what it's
[2:11:01] like right now witnessing it here in our
[2:11:03] midst. I'm not interested in just
[2:11:05] leaving it back there. And I don't want
[2:11:07] to put it off in the future. I don't
[2:11:08] want to be guilty of what the prophet
[2:11:10] said, looking back to what God has done,
[2:11:12] looking forward to what he's going to
[2:11:14] do, and ignoring what he's doing right
[2:11:16] now in this service.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; If we've got trouble, what are we
[2:11:20] thinking about it?
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Now, just let me tell you how you're
[2:11:25] feeling.
[2:11:27] Who says those words? That's just let me
[2:11:30] tell you how you're feeling and then
[2:11:32] you'll know. A real warm, sweet,
[2:11:35] comfortable feeling. I'm looking right
[2:11:37] straight at it. It's that light, amber
[2:11:39] light hanging from the woman. And I want
[2:11:41] to say today, I I can't tell you that I
[2:11:43] can see an amber light hanging from
[2:11:45] anybody. I I can't see it, but I just
[2:11:47] take him at his word. His word says that
[2:11:49] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:11:50] forever. He took 39 stripes for our
[2:11:53] healing. He is our deliverer. He is our
[2:11:56] comforter. He is our strength.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; I just want to take him at his word.
[2:12:01] Amen.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, "And the lady is
[2:12:05] suffering with a trouble in her stomach.
[2:12:07] It's kind of a growth like in her
[2:12:09] stomach. She is not from here." No, you
[2:12:12] you're from away. You're you you're
[2:12:14] you're you're from away from here,
[2:12:16] aren't you? That's right. You're from
[2:12:18] Wisconsin. Is that right? Sure. Now you
[2:12:20] are healed. Your faith has made you
[2:12:22] whole. Amen.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; Now tell me who the woman touched.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Because you know I remember brother Pete
[2:12:30] Clawson saying that she never touched
[2:12:31] brother Brandham.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; They never touched.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; It was simply words. It was speaking. So
[2:12:38] who did she touch? Who was it that she
[2:12:41] touched?
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; I think it's amazing brothers and
[2:12:44] sisters. We have the ability to touch
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; Melzdc.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; The priest of the most high God. The one
[2:12:51] who actually is our atonement.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; The one who is actually here in our
[2:12:57] midst today.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; Who wants to deliver us from whatever
[2:13:00] the problem is, whatever the trouble is
[2:13:02] in our life.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; But it depends on what we think about
[2:13:06] it.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; I'm going to call the musicians this
[2:13:09] morning.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, our thinking has
[2:13:12] everything to do with it.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Is it fanaticism?
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Is it just a a crank? Is it just a cult
[2:13:21] or is it truly the vindication of the
[2:13:24] word of God to the age in which we live?
[2:13:27] Is it truly the manifestation of the
[2:13:30] Revelations 10 1-7?
[2:13:34] If it truly is that, then what about 8
[2:13:37] to 11
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; or 8-13?
[2:13:41] The latter part of that scripture, take
[2:13:44] that book and eat it up. Don't just
[2:13:47] leave it. take it and make it your own.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; But what we think about it, that's what
[2:13:53] we're going to get.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; I love how he says that. I'm going to go
[2:13:56] back to what he says here. Depends on
[2:13:58] what you think it is,
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters. This could be just
[2:14:03] an ordinary service for us today.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; It depends on what you think it is.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; It could be the greatest service of our
[2:14:11] lives.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; It depends on what we think it is.
[2:14:14] Tonight when we come and partake of the
[2:14:16] communion,
[2:14:17] it could be the greatest service of our
[2:14:19] life.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; It depends on what we think it is.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; You can take your side with the priest,
[2:14:27] call it the devil, call it a cult, call
[2:14:30] it whatever you want. Or you can take
[2:14:32] the side with the believer and call it
[2:14:34] God.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me this morning as we
[2:14:38] close. Ever which you believe,
[2:14:41] that's where your reward will come from.
[2:14:43] Amen.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; I want to say, God, richly bless you
[2:14:46] today.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; As we close, let's bow in prayer.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we're so
[2:14:54] thankful Lord that you have given us
[2:14:57] your word.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, you've given us two roads
[2:15:00] that we can travel.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; Father, one by sight or one by faith.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, not to look at the
[2:15:08] natural,
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; oh Father, but to look at the
[2:15:11] supernatural.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. to look at the the word that
[2:15:14] you've given us in the day in which we
[2:15:16] live, Lord. To know that, Father,
[2:15:18] there's so much more for us, Lord. We're
[2:15:21] not looking for signs and wonders, but
[2:15:23] we are we are fully aware of who you
[2:15:27] have called us to be.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, many times even we would
[2:15:32] say that we're fully aware. Maybe we
[2:15:34] don't have a full consciousness. Maybe
[2:15:36] we just don't fully realize or
[2:15:39] comprehend it. And and if that's the
[2:15:41] case, Lord, I pray that you would help
[2:15:42] us, Lord, because we know that you said
[2:15:45] through your prophet that when the
[2:15:46] church recognizes what it is, then the
[2:15:49] rapture will go.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Father, we have many desires in this
[2:15:54] life.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; Many needs, many situations and
[2:15:58] circumstances.
[2:16:00] Oh, Father, but there's nothing greater
[2:16:02] than that marriage supper of the lamb.
[2:16:05] Father, being able to, like we read
[2:16:07] about earlier today, to meet you in the
[2:16:09] clouds,
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Father, to know that we will not hinder
[2:16:12] those that went ahead of us and sleep,
[2:16:16] Father. But in the moment, in a
[2:16:18] twinkling of an eye, they'll go first
[2:16:19] and we will be together with you in the
[2:16:23] clouds forever.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would just take
[2:16:26] the words that were spoken today,
[2:16:28] Father, and just allow them, Lord Jesus,
[2:16:31] to nourish our souls.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, I pray that you would help
[2:16:35] us, Lord, to adjust our thinking, not to
[2:16:37] our own ways, Father. Not to a a a
[2:16:40] scientific thinking, not to a a critical
[2:16:43] way of thinking according to this world.
[2:16:45] Oh, Father, according to the tree of
[2:16:47] knowledge of good and evil. Help us,
[2:16:49] Lord. Forgive us, Lord Jesus. Help us to
[2:16:52] look at it through your eyes, Lord
[2:16:54] Jesus. Through the tree of life. Help
[2:16:58] us, Lord Jesus, to see it the way that
[2:17:00] you have created it, the way that you
[2:17:02] have written it, the way that you have
[2:17:03] delivered it. Father, help us just
[2:17:06] accept it the way that you have done it.
[2:17:08] And Father, just yield ourselves to it.
[2:17:12] We pray that you would bless your
[2:17:14] children today. Be with those who
[2:17:15] couldn't be here. Father, there's so
[2:17:17] many that are away. Some are traveling.
[2:17:19] Some might be sick.
[2:17:21] Oh, Father, maybe some are hurting. We
[2:17:24] pray that you would be with them
[2:17:25] wherever they are, whatever they're
[2:17:27] doing, Lord Jesus, that you would
[2:17:29] minister to them, Father. Strengthen
[2:17:31] them and encourage them. I pray. And
[2:17:34] Father, if it be your will for us to
[2:17:36] meet again here tonight, Lord, to
[2:17:38] discern your body. Help us not to wait
[2:17:41] till tonight to discern your body. But
[2:17:43] let us get after it right now, Lord,
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; as we go forwards. Father, tonight we'll
[2:17:48] be careful to give you all the praise.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; We just love you and we thank you. We
[2:17:53] ask all these things in Jesus Christ's
[2:17:55] name we pray.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we sing that song? The winds
[2:18:04] of faith.

[2:18:18] you may take.

[2:18:31] Take the word of God
[2:18:34] or what you see.

[2:18:42] is what will be.
[2:18:47] Set your wings
[2:18:50] to the winds of faith.

[2:29:20] the potter's hand as we dismiss today.
[2:29:22] And you know, just before we sing it, I
[2:29:24] just wanted to remember what a wonderful
[2:29:27] blessing it is for us to be able to get
[2:29:29] back together again. And you know, to
[2:29:32] see the Lord take us and we go away and
[2:29:35] we come back again. We're certainly
[2:29:37] thankful for the Lord's hand in the
[2:29:39] panicker's life. That family is a
[2:29:43] wonderful family and we certainly are
[2:29:44] thankful that brother John is back in
[2:29:46] our midst. Even though I didn't mention
[2:29:48] you at the beginning of the service,
[2:29:50] brother, I mentioned you at the end. We
[2:29:51] sure love and appreciate you and your
[2:29:53] family.
[2:29:55] We just want to trust the Lord will
[2:29:57] continue leading and guiding the
[2:29:59] panickers as they integrated into
[2:30:01] Canada.
[2:30:03] Oh, beautiful Lord,
[2:30:07] wonderful Savior.
[2:30:11] I know for sure
[2:30:14] that all of my days
[2:30:17] are held in your hand.
