journey in the exposition of the seven Church ages we'll just read the first 20 verses of the first chapter of Revelation I know it's a lot of reading but what else would we rather do all right on a Wednesday night amen but read the word of God right so we'll just read the first 20 verses of the first chapter of Revelation verse one says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood blood and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the Earth shall wail because of him even so amen I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending saith the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the Almighty I John who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called patmas for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ amen I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus and unto smyna and unto pergamus and unto thyra and unto Sardis and unto Philadelphia and unto Leo deia and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks amen and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strengthen and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen amen and have the keys of hell and death and of death write the things which thou Hast seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches amen let's just bow in prayer one more time gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful for your word amen hallelujah and Lord Jesus we're just as thankful for the exposition of your word Lord the Revelation father The Apocalypse of this word and father we can read it with natural eyes but father we we depend on your spirit Lord Jesus so we just invite you to come Lord as we begin this journey into this book father we know this isn't a man's book this is a book that you chose to have published and father we pray that you would just reveal it to us father that you would speak to us as we go along the way on this journey father as long as it takes father we pray that you would just be glorified in every single study every single discussion of this book father we pray that it would just become a new book to all of us father that Lord Jesus we would be able to see you in a greater light Lord that you would just reveal yourself to us further Lord we just want to commit this service and every single other service now in the study of this book into your hands as we go forwards we love you and we thank you we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated sorry I might be drinking a little bit of water tonight I had a little Dental thing today and my mouth is a little bit raw you happy tonight amen I just think it's so wonderful you know we heard that song tonight brother faren sang a new song and can be a little bit different when we hear new things and it can seem like maybe it's a little bit different and sometimes different can equate to actual conflict and it's important to remember that just because excuse me something is a little bit different it doesn't mean mean that it's bad or it's wrong it can just be different and we need to be able to have that flexibility to trust that everything will be fine I just think it's so important for us to recognize you know uh I I think that I would say I said it but I want to say it this way I believe the spirit said it on Sunday how many enjoyed that service on Sunday I I believe we had the Lord here I believe he came and visited Calgary Living Word cuzu I could never do that on my own but just to think about it you know what we sang tonight in that new song if if if Satan is not under our feet a and we are not positioned in Heavenly places then something is wrong Satan is the one that's supposed to be under our feet he's not supposed to be anywhere else in our lives and you know if he is then we need to acknowledge that we need to rebuke him and put him back in his place amen because we don't flee we know that we're supposed to actually submit ourselves therefore unto God then resist the devil resist Satan and he has to flee and where does he have to flee I think it's so beautiful he has to flee under our feet that's his position our position is in Heavenly places in the throne not even just around the throne not even just in another maybe condo in heaven but in the throne amen that's our position and if we don't see this then we need to just take take an inventory and check it up and make sure that that Christ is our theme that we are focused on Christ that we don't lose our desire to seek Christ I just think it's beautiful the the specials tonight thank you Brothers um you know talking about this study of the the exposition of the seven Church ages we're just beginning it and uh we're just going to start here and and see how far it will go I mean we started last week but we've got 45 minutes and I don't know how far you can really get in 45 minutes especially if you have a a preacher talking maybe you'll get one paragraph of the book study in and uh we'll just see but tonight I just felt led to you know set the background read what brother Branham does in in the in the exposition of the seven Church ages he he starts the book with Revelations chapter 1 veres 1 to 20 the first 20 verses of that chapter and the only verses of that chapter but he he reads that and he just sets the background forward and isn't it wonderful to read this scripture and to recognize you know when many times we would hear people talk about God in heaven and try and separate him as a a third person or a second person or another person of some sort of of conglomeration of of godliness how how we would see him as maybe a do old grandpa he's got gray hair and and he's really kind and loving and and he doesn't really have any judgment you know that's that's the way some people would like to portray him but what we read tonight I believe is a real accurate depiction his head is his hairs are white like wool white as snow and his eyes are as a flame of fire he says were as a flame of fire but I would say and I believe we could all say it tonight they are as a flame of fire because two times in here he says which was which is and is to come he is the same yesterday today and forever but that was actually repeated twice in this chapter it's very important to remember that this is the God we're talking about he's a god of judgment he's a righteous God but he's a god of judgment a and we're not here to point fingers at anybody we're just simply here to say you know what this is the way he's depicted it and and we just receive it the way that he's given it amen but talking about this um the introduction of the the Revelation the exposition of the seven Church ages if we could go to that the introduction I believe it's chapter 1 if you were to press play you would hear chapter 1 but we're not going to do that tonight I thought about it I wasn't sure how bad my mouth would be um just to give you an idea my my half of my tongue is still numb so I might be slobbering a little bit and we'll just see how it goes here but uh revelation Ians 1: 1 to3 if you still have your Bibles open maybe we could just read that until we get it up on the screen here Revelations 1 verse one says the revelation of Jesus Christ I I had a conversation with a brother once upon a time and I thought it was so good when you want to talk to someone about Jesus you can actually just say that that first sentence the revelation of Jesus Christ what is that that is the new birth right there the revelation of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ God himself making himself known personally to the individual the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand I personally think this is just a wonderful thing whether we read this or whether we hear this we're blessed amen hallelujah So reading 20 verses tonight out of this I believe we could close our Bibles and go home and say we're blessed because that's what the word of God says it's beautiful do we have that up there there we go beautiful so the introduction of chapter 1 I'll go past the scripture here uh bear with me yeah for the time is at hand sorry I read out of my Bible not out of the the app here the Scribe not the author of this book is St John the Divine I'm sure we all know this probably preaching into the choir every single step of the the way but we're just going to talk about it like maybe someone here doesn't know it and uh just just say Amen to it I know it can seem like uh maybe a groaner if you're really used to it but it it's important this is vital to understand that not just this book but the entire Bible we were having a conversation a little while ago about it talking about the gospels and the gospels maybe sound like they're individuals and and they're not it's the gospel but it's the individuals who actually wrote it but they didn't write it they weren't the authors of it they were the scribes of it right so it's important to talk about this John is not the author of this book Jesus Christ is the author of this book the holy spirit is the author of this book amen God Almighty is the author of this book because we know they are one amen but not the Oneness style of one we're not going to going to get too far into that tonight but I think it's just important to recognize this is the revelation of Jesus Christ this is the manifestation the manifested attribute of God that he wanted to give to mankind so that mankind could actually comprehend God in in a form not just an object of worship in in in the sky in a Heavenly place somewhere but an actual man a person uh make it more personable to a human being so we could comprehend it with our our minds with our finite minds but the Scribe not the author of this book is St John the Divine historians agree that he lived the last part of his life in Ephesus though at the time of the writing of this book he was on the aisle of patmas it's not the life story of John but it is the revelation of Jesus Christ in the future ages I just think that's beautiful because even in the time this was written in 1965 is when it went to print it was it was preached in the 60s and and scribed throughout afterwards but then in 1965 it actually went to print and and here we have him talking about Jesus Christ being revealed in the future ages and here we are how many ages down the road are we how long is an age I don't know some people might put some time to it might be 40 years might be 80 years could be a hundred years I I wouldn't want to say but here we are in the future looking at this saying Amen to it it's not the life story of John but it's the revelation of Jesus Christ in the future Church ages in verse three it's called a prophecy and that is what it actually is amen we know that the Book of Revelation is actually called a book of symbols and brother brandham preaches a whole message on that I'm not excuse me going to get too far into that he goes on to say this book is usually termed the revelation of St John but but that is incorrect these are really simple points but these are things that many people have grown up believing to be different and that's why I want to just really emphasize this I know myself I grew up believing this was different this book is usually term the revelation of St John but that's incorrect it is the revelation of Jesus of Jesus Christ given to John not just for John but for all Christians of all ages it's the only book in the entire Bible that is written by Jesus himself amen through personally appearing to a scribe yes I think it's important in here as well just maybe I won't get into that yet pardon me I'll go on and read here it is the last book of the Bible and yet it tells the beginning and the end of the dispensations of the Gospel brother branam says it in this message in in this chapter I believe he says it in here that Satan hates this book more than any other book in the Bible because it talks about his destruction and and you know we we're not going to go get into that tonight but the inspiration strikes and you just kind of have to go with it but he hates the two books in the Bible the most Genesis and Revelation Genesis talks about his his beginning and how he entered into the human race and Revelation talks about the ending of it but he says it's the last book of the Bible yet it tells the beginning and end of the dispensations of the Gospel the reation of Jesus Christ he says now the Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling this unveiling is perfectly described in the example of a sculptor unveiling his work of statutary statutary exposing it to the onlooker it is an uncovering revealing what was previously hidden now if anybody hasn't heard it brother Brandon preaches two messages and I believe they're uh there I can't remember exactly what year it is it might be 64 63 the unveiling of God and then he preaches the Mighty God unveiled and he says in one of those messages sometimes God will actually say things without coming right out and saying it all the way to what it is he leaves room for us to interpret it he will say it without actually saying saying it all the way it's important for us to understand that's what the prophet was actually doing he was actually voicing for God that God is actually unveiling himself we heard it in the song tonight he's here brother bradam declared that he's here he's not coming he's already here it's beautiful but this is the unveiling amen it's an uncovering revealing what was previously hidden now the uncovering is not only the revelation of the person of Christ but it is the revelation of his Future Works in the oncoming seven Church ages I wanted to see if that was actually uh capitalized there because it is in mine I think it's important for us to catch that the revelation of his Future Works in the oncoming seven Church ages and you know we have actually seen the end or the blend whichever way you would like to say it of the leoan church age which is the last one we've got into another age brother Bram said it it's a bride Age and and we're not actually looking at our lives as one of these Church ages we've actually gone beyond that and we'll never go beyond the word of a prophet just for the record when I say go beyond that we've gone beyond where we can see all of the church ages maybe I'll bring the the the pyramid and we'll show um the layers in it but we showed it I I've talked about it many times in the past but we're still going to do that I need maybe someone to help me with that I'm not that great with computers but you know how we have the the the pyramid and then we actually show that there's an end of the pyramid at the Le oysan Church age and then we show the next pyramid coming down the Capstone we call it and that is actually God himself love you know I believe we can take those two and put them together this is just my view we can put those together and make them one we've already seen the Capstone Ministry of this word if he's here there's no space brothers and sisters between him and the bride between him and the stature of that perfect man there's no space in between I remember brother meno saying there's no mortar between that Capstone when it comes down right it's the revelation of his Future Works in the oncoming seven Church ages it's as far as I'm going to read in that tonight I have a a bunch of quotes and I have one thought that I really want to try and actually get into tonight and and it's important I believe it's very very important for us to recognize you know out of out of the scripture that we read tonight I believe it's in uh Revelations 1:1 there's a word signify in there it's it's strongs G 4591 and and it's a real simple simple one it says to indicate I think it's just important for us to talk about these things he sent and signified it by his angel or he sent and indicated it by his Angel unto his servant John this is the strong concordance for the King James version it's it's important to to see sometimes the meaning of these words it's used twice signified in the King James version of the Bible there's signify it's used many times but signified it means that it was already done he indicated it to his to his Angel unto his servant John um and I just wanted to bring another scripture just acts 11 the other one that's in the Bible Acts 11:28 and there stood up one of them named agabus and signified by the spirit or indicated by the spirit that there should be a great dir throughout all the world which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar and we know that the scripture if you want to read it maybe you don't know it it goes on to say that they actually got together and they helped the People by Barnabas and by Paul they actually helped feed the people that were starving in that time the point is that signified is the exact same word used in both scriptures and it's the exact same word in the Strong's Concordance it is g45 91 means to indicate but I think in Acts 11 here it just sort of uh kind of underscores or highlights the point that I want to get to it was signified by the spirit it wasn't signified by the church it wasn't signified ifed by John it wasn't signified by Paul it wasn't signified by anyone else other than the spirit and I think that's just such an important thing it's so beautiful and you know that's what has to happen in the life of a Believer we can't talk about this without preaching a little bit can we amen it has to be in the life of a Believer he has to come and indicate it in our lives himself that we have seen this gospel that it's been revealed to us that we understand understand what's going on in our day maybe we don't understand all of it but we have an understanding that God has come to talk to us personally and when we have that understanding brothers and sisters then we follow the word it's our desire when we follow the word we get the Holy Ghost when we get the Holy Ghost he the spirit of truth comes by and what he signifies it to us personally he indicates to us that this is correct amen amen you know Romans 8:15 for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear have you anybody afraid tonight if you're afraid if we're afraid it's a spirit and it wants to take us into bondage to say that oh no we can't let go and and worship or oh no we can't let go and and and and get into this thing that we're talking about here if that's what's going on it's a spirit brothers and sisters maybe it's just a spirit of fear that would say you know I don't know I feel like my whole life is going to collapse maybe the bank is going to come and take my house maybe I'm going to lose my job maybe I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow maybe the whole world's going to come to an end maybe I need to store up a whole bunch of food because we could have a war here in Canada you know what the devil wants us to be afraid but he's the one that's afraid the Bride of Jesus Christ ain't afraid she knows where she stands amen you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear no way no way you have received the spirit of adoption and that Spirit of adoption causes us to cry ABA father gives us the ability to worship him because the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God we can get our new spirit and we can try but you know what will happen is eventually our old man will rise up in our life and actually have control our old man will rise up and say nope you know what something's not right in there and we'll go back and we'll say Lord help me but you know I want to say this if we do have that cycle in our lives he is the chain breaker he is the cycle breaker when his Spirit gets into our lives the Holy Spirit it Bears witness his Spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God amen amen going somewhere with this tonight it's not not about just maybe saying that we need to make sure that we we we line up a certain way even though we do but what I want to say tonight is the spirit bearth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and that we believe the word of God and that we believe the message of the hour and that's what I'm getting at tonight I'm really trying to underscore the exposition of the seven Church ages as we go with this I I'm just going to preach a little bit the the other word in there that I wanted to bring out was the angel he came and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John in g32 in the Strong's Concordance that word is Angelos and it sounds pretty straightforward it's derived from g71 compared with g34 to bring Tidings a messenger especially An Angel by implication this one made me a little bit weak in the knees by implication a pastor Angel mess messenger I heard somebody mention this and uh I I didn't really know what to think about it so I had to look it up myself if anybody is interested you can look it up in the message brother brandham says that a pastor an ordained Pastor is an angel messenger that one just about put me on the floor because I don't feel like an angel messenger I don't but you know what feelings have nothing to do with it if God's called someone and there's been a vote for that person and the majority vote is for that person then you know what that's God speaking in the midst that's what the prophet of God said that's the way it works so if that's the case then I say Lord just be it unto me according to Thy word just let let let your spirit come and bear witness uh signify it indicate it to us that that's what you've got going on here and I just think it's so beautiful because really my desire brothers and sisters is to point to Christ don't point to me don't Don't point to this church don't point to anyone else don't don't don't point to Jeffersonville point to Christ because if brother bradam was Jeffersonville tonight he would say point to Christ that's what the prophet of God would say in 1950 obey the voice of the Angel it's 1950 0713 were you able to get them we can go slow someone said not long ago to me said brother Adam almost there someone said not long ago to me said brother brandham Angels was ministering spirits in the Old Testament but since the Holy Spirit has come we don't have ministering Angels anymore he says now dear friends this is not a worship of angels understand we do not believe in worship shiing Angels there's only one to be worshiped and that's God Amen and his son our Holy Spirit No Angel no not no man or No Angel to be worshiped and now the angel of God a true angel of God would not stand still to be worshiped right we're going to talk about this a little bit tonight an angel of God will not stand to be worshiped I heard something that blew me away today I heard that there's people that actually have their Pastor the pastor comes to the pulpit being carried to the pulpit could you believe that that just shocked me it's people worshiping a minister worshiping a pastor elevating something to to to somewhere they don't want to be and I personally believe I think we read a quote a little while ago brother bradam says it's not the person it's the people the people do it it's terrible but what's that Pastor saying what's that what's that teacher teaching what's that evangelist evangelizing because brother Ram says it very clearly just give it the word test if you want to know what's right give it the word test and see what that what that comes back like amen out of 1950 obey the voice of the Angel it's paragraph 12 we know that Paul had the Holy Spirit do you believe that well when he was 14 days and nights upon the sea without any moon or stars and it was all dark and he went down in the gallery to pray he come back and told the men be of a good courage for the angel of God whose servant I am came to me last night and said fear not Paul is that right not the Holy Spirit the angel of God see an angel of God sent from God and then John and then John the Revelator the whole book of Revelation when it was wrote he said I have sent my angel Jesus did and John fell down to worship the angel but the angel said stand up worship God see a true true angel of God won't stand to be worshiped right I'll just say it again A True True angel of God won't stand to be worshiped and he said that he was of the prophets and his fellow men that had been sent to signify these things therefore Angelic beings is ordained ministers of God to come to the Earth to Bear record of God and they work through mortal beings just as they did through Daniel and back through the ages there and I believe it with all my heart and we know as Believers that there's times where there's angels that have wings we know the Bible talks about angels I believe it's the seraphim I could be wrong they've got six wings two to cover their face two to cover their feet to show reverence and two to fly and their commission is to fly Before the Throne day and night and cry holy holy holy art thou oh Lord God Almighty but there's also angels that are referred to in the Bible as men many times people see angels and they referred to as Angels but they say they met a man we know just one that comes to mind I don't have a whole bunch of examples tonight in the word but I just want to try and do it as quickly as I can and the little bit of time we have but we know Paul said that one time he met a man and whether he was in the Spirit or whether he was asleep or whether he was in a vision he doesn't know he was caught up into the third heaven was it and and he just didn't know what it was but he said he met a man how could a human being take someone into another dimension it doesn't happen it was a ministering Angel the example that I'm getting at is the Bible refers to angels as men men out of 1953 0603 God commissioned ing Moses true ministry will not accept worship true ministry will actually point to Christ and that's what the prophet of God said and I'll say it this way I always do this brothers and sisters has just become so real to me recently that's what God Said through the prophet many times we can say well that's what the prophet said and we just take it right out of God's hands and we make it into a human being and we know we're talking about man being Angels but you know what this is God's word that's coming to us through this man amen amen amen paragraph 8 now tonight God is still God is he still God tonight and now when God led the children of Israel out he brought down an an angel God is always using angels in his work there's never been an angel of God worshiped for he wouldn't stand for it a true angel of God God doesn't stand to be worshiped but God has had Angels through every dispensation true angel will never accept worship but isn't it interesting when we look at this this scripture that we read here in Revelation I I think it's just so beautiful verse 17 out of Revelations chapter 1 just keep that quote there too don't take it down but Revelations 1:1 17 says and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead John did that a couple other times but not as dead but he did fall at others feet right when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last this one didn't tell him don't worship this one explained who he was but the other two in Revelations said no no no no see thou do it not I you know what don't do it that's going to get us kicked out of here don't do that right worship god brother Ram says recently a man that belongs to a fine Full Gospel Church said to me brother branam said you keep speaking of an angel that visit you I I just just got into this and I thought it's so interesting so that's why that's why I'm reading it tonight I I just think it's important he said you keep speaking of an angel that visit you I read your books and so forth an angel said son that's an error I said sir it isn't he said God don't lead any church today by angels He said he said he Daniel and the prophets and them had angels in the Old Testament but the Holy Spirit leads the church Church in this last day I said that's true but they're still Angels right he said not New Testament doctorine brother Bram I said oh brother there sure sure there is I said do you believe that the Virgin Mary was in the New Testament when the angel Gabriel up there he said but that was before the Holy Spirit came I said then do you believe Phillip had the Holy Ghost he said yes I said who was it that told him down in Samaria to go to the desert Gaza for the unic of Ethiopia was it the Holy Spirit or the angel of the Lord it was the angel of the Lord not the holy spirit so I said do you believe that St Paul had the Holy Ghost he said sure do you believe Peter had the Holy Ghost he said sure I said then when Peter was in prison he had a prayer meeting at John Mark's house who was it that came into the bars like a light and shine down on him the angel of the Lord see who was it Paul after 14 days and nights with no moon stars or nothing to show and all hopes they'd ever be saved out on the Storm was ever give up and gone and Paul went down into the gallery and he after a while he returned turned and said be of a good cheer for the angel of God whose servant I am stood by me saying fear not Paul thou must be brought before Caesar and lo Gods give all them said wherefore Brethren I believe God and it shall be just as it was shown unto me and we know this story how that ship did crash and how everybody did go ashore and how it was such a terrible tragedy in that moment but imagine what kind of Peace would have come over Paul what kind of Peace would have come over the people on the ship to recognize that not one person's going to get lost and then we know the rest of the story parts of it anyways when they're on the shore now they're freezing cold trying to get warm and they build a fire Paul goes to throw on a stick and what happened a Viper jumps out and bites him and what did he do he flicked it and we know we've heard this story many times that was a terrible terrible snake and that snake would just inflict pain that would actually kill someone the Venom from that immediately almost immediately but what happened they saw that he was actually a man of God if it wasn't in the ship getting Shipwrecked seeing the angel of the Lord that would have changed their minds out of the resurrection of Lazarus in 1953 11:22 all this is talking about tonight we don't worship an angel we don't worship a messenger there's no human being on this planet before or after aside from Jesus Christ that gets worship any other spirit that would say any other thing we know that Paul said that'll be a cursed anyone that would come and preach anything different than what Paul said 1953 the resurrection of Lazarus 11:22 he says look the aisle over on the aisle of patmas the whole book of Revelations was revealed by an Angel I Jesus has sent my angel to show you things that'll shortly come to pass is that right the whole and John started to worship the angel but a true angel will never stand to be worshiped no sir he said worship God that's true oh there's false Angels true just like there's false spirit and so forth but a true angel of God will always point you to Jesus Christ yes sir Paul said if an angel from heaven can you imagine that sometimes it's good just to think about this if an angel from heaven would preach any other gospel because we know that there's other angels that are from Heaven that would come as angels of light right and they would preach another gospel because that's where all the Angels Came From if an angel from heaven would come and preach any other gospel then that which you've already heard let them be accursed is that right so watch so watch what the angel teaches and I just want to say it tonight brothers and sisters we we've said it already brother Bram has that quote I'm not bringing it tonight because it makes me feel uncomfortable truly to think that brother bradam would say that an ordained minister would be an actual ministering Angel but if a preacher is preaching anything other than what this message says than what brother brandham brought then it's wrong right he's preaching something different it's an uncertain sound brother branam talks about it I just had this inspiration it hit me a while ago but you know how brother bradam talks about it when they cast Bells they cast Bells out of bronze and brass and they're giant Bells some are giant some are small but they all have to be be tested once they're cast and and they're cooled the hot metal is poured and and and they cool they have to pull them out of the molds and they've got a bang them to test them and if there's a crack or a blemish in that Bell it won't ring true and we know that we have to take what we hear and it's got to be rung and we've got to be able to say it resounds correctly we have to hear that certain sound and if we don't we need to make sure that we can just push it aside but we've got to know where we stand amen watch what that angel teaches if it's anything other than what William Mary and bradam said then push it aside brothers and sisters don't say that there's maybe another Vindication maybe we've got a sign maybe we saw a healing maybe we see a great ministry maybe we've got a a a great thing going on it doesn't matter if it's an angel from heaven that preaches a different gospel right that's what Paul said so I don't know how we could get any greater than that on Earth amen or fascinating Paul said if an angel from heaven will come preach any of the gospel and that which you've already heard let him be a cursed is that right so watch what the angel teaches if it's bringing along in the gospel and sound Doctrine and everything according to the Bible then believe it amen but how are you going to know if you don't have the Holy Ghost in your life how are you going to know if you don't read the Bible how you going know if you don't listen to the message of the hour says so God always sends Angelic beings to warn the world I believe that there's Angelic beings in the Earth today isn't that amazing to think about what he's saying there I believe there's Angelic beings in the Earth today did they just disappear when he disappeared I believe there's Angelic beings in in the Earth today he didn't say I'm the only Angelic being in the Earth today that's right I believe there's Angelic beings in the Earth today are warning the world of judgment to come I could go a little bit go on a little bit about your flying saucer here for just a few minutes but I won't take that much time but I will I just want to press pause brothers and sisters we know the world is blowing up over in the Middle East one of the news headlines I saw I'm sorry I'm looking at news again I just I I can see what's going on but you know one of the things I saw was that UFO sightings are up in the United States and we're watching this War break out over in Israel what's going on yes we know what's going on brother bradam said those are investigating judgment angels and they're coming down to see what's going on I'll continue on reading here that's the only thing I'm going to say about it brothers and sisters this this whole earth is shaking he says I could go a little bit on your flying saucery here for just a few minutes but I won't take that much time but anyhow did you notice before the destruction of Sodom and gomorah which is a perfect thing of today God sent Angels down there to call lot out is that true amen I'll just say it what the word of God says come out of her my people and be ye not partakers of her sins he says look just before the coming of the righteous one the great Son of God God sent an angel down and that angel come to a home that was a respected home if you want angels to visit your home be like zachariah's home amen I believe we could just preach a whole entire sermon on that right there I I heard that and I thought my I want my home to be like that don't you want your home to be like that brothers and sisters brother brandom talks about fasting and praying and how the angel of the Lord would come and visit him when he would fast and pray it's just really impressed upon my heart I want the angel of the Lord in my home and you know one of the best ways we can do it is to apply the token don't go and get a chicken and get some blood and try and do it it's not going to do it just take the word of God for your day take the message of the hour and see if that token doesn't come into your home he says look just before the coming of the righteous one the great Son of God God sent an angel down and that angel come to a home that was a respected home if you want angels to visit your home be like zachariah's home him and Sarah was living upright before the Lord and we know that probably Sarah wasn't married to Zacharias but anyways um he says him and Sarah was living upright before the Lord keeping all the statutes and all the Commandments of the Lord living in perfect obedience to the word and in the light that they had and Zacharias his office was to wave incense burning incense at the altar while the people were praying and we know that an angel came and Stood Beside the altar while he was there this is Elizabeth's husband for anyone that maybe doesn't know and Zacharias his office was to wave incense burning incense at the altar while the people were praying and while he was waving this incense standing on the right hand side of the altar stood Gabriel the great Archangel now angels can come I love this part but when you hear of Gabriel coming be ready something major is on the road Gabriel announced the first coming of Jesus and Gabriel will announce the second coming of Jesus that's right amen how is that going to happen what is that going to look like this this got me pondering for hours this afternoon what's that going to look like brothers and sisters I'm not going to say one way or the other I know there's going to be two witnesses that are going to come but Gabriel's going to announce it I just think it's amazing the angels are talked about it was an angel of the Lord that came came and actually showed John his servant came and indicated came and signified this word to his servant John and I just think it's so beautiful because we've had an angel in our day haven't we who has come and indicated and signified that this message of this hour is the true word of God for us in our day and I just think it's fantastic that's why I'm just dwelling on it I I I don't know we'll get in back into it here uh don't worry got five minutes left 1958 0214 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen we have his picture here on paper he says many of you have seen it might we we don't have time to tell you of it that's not my picture isn't that beautiful we have the prophet of God saying that's not my picture what's what's this man doing what's this angel doing he's actually separating himself and saying don't look at me look at him amen that light you see ain't me that light is not a gift that God gave me that that light is him that's with me he says we don't have time to tell you of it that's not my picture I'm your brother but it's been questioned what was that to me it was the same God that led the children of Israel by a pillar of Fire fire we all know that that was the logos that the angel of the Covenant which was Christ that led the children of Israel Christ declared it to be so he said he was the I am that was in the burning bush and he was the rock that was in the wilderness don't you just love reading the messag isn't it wonderful I know some people would say just paron the prophet I say Amen I'm going to be a real good parrot he said he was the I am that was in the burning bush and he was the rock that was in the wilderness that Pillar of Fire was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and when he was here he said I come from God and I go back to God and after his death burial and Resurrection when he appeared to Paul on the road to Damascus he had again the same logos in a pillar of fire manifesting himself and remember Paul said said who is it Lord isn't it interesting that he knew that the light was so bright that it put Paul's eyes out yet those standing by couldn't see it it was a reality to those who God would reveal it to but the others who stood by didn't know nothing about it just like the seventh seal he says they don't know nothing about it just like that A Blank Spot on the tape and he said I'm Jesus did the bible say that I am Jesus and it's hard for you to kick against the Pricks he came in as a pillar of fire and delivered Peter out of the fiery furnace says I've Heard lots of things about angels we read of Joseph Smith we know that but a true angel of God will bear record with the word of God and he will never move from the word and that my friends my brothers my sisters is why I par the prophet cuz you know what maybe someone would say that that description could fit me I wouldn't say that it would but if if if I find myself in that position as a ministering Angel it just sounds weird but if that's the case I'll say this I know I've got nothing else to say am I want to say what he said and that's all I want to say cuz there's no new revelation the only thing is the revelation of the entirety of what he's already said I just love it he says but a true angel of God will bear record with the word of God and he'll never move from the word of God and you know what's interesting because Paul himself even identified himself as an angel he referenced himself as an angel I'll call the musicians as we close tonight on study of the exposition of the seven Church ages just wanted to set the background just just really slowly go through this as I've mentioned over and over again amen we're not worshiping a man and we're not worshiping an Angel that's right he wasn't worshiping a man and he wasn't encouraging worshiping a man or an angel when he wrote this book when he was the Scribe of this book he was saying worship God Amen and we'll read the last chapter of it maybe sooner than later but if you read it he says what his intentions are at the very last paragraph of this book but Paul in Galatians 4:14 and he says and my Temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not nor rejected but receive me as an angel of God even as Jesus Christ this verse got me stimulated and it does even now maybe stand with me as we close brothers and sisters can can we do this with one another this verse here if we can say I and my father are one amen can we say you and your father are one I I can see it in you I can see him in you you and your father are one that's right and whoever it is that we worship whatever it is that we feed on that's what we're going to be that's what we're going to show amen but can we look at ourselves and say my temptation we've all got our Temptation which was in our flesh we've all got this flesh and The Temptations the problems the issues that come along with all the genetics it says Paul in his temptation which was in his flesh you despise not nor rejected are we able to do that despise not or reject the Flesh in our brother or our sister my goodness even a and received those people even as an angel of God even as Jesus Christ I think that's just that's a lot to take in that's a lot to take in I have so much more to get into I'll read one more quote we're okay for five minutes yes 1958 0223 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever he says the angel of God paragraph 51 the angel of God whose picture is back there if it doesn't bear record of Christ then it's a wrong Angel yeah that about Joseph Smith seeing an angel it didn't bear the record of Christ but a true angel of God will bear the record of Christ a true grape vine will bear grapes and a true spirit of God will manifest Jesus Christ if it doesn't then then it don't answer to the urum Thum and we know the urum Thum is this right here the urum th out of the Old Testament is actually the the thing that the high priest wore that Aaron wore and we know that it had the gems on it and when someone had a vision or a prophecy they spoke it before that urum th they brought them before that and if it flashed then it was true if it if it resonated like ringing that Bell if it had that sure sound then it was correct but if it didn't Flash and it had a a vibration in it if it sounded a little bit off then it was off and they just left it alone he talking about the ear Thum here true spirit of God will manifest Jesus Christ if it doesn't then it don't answer to the Yum thumb then it doesn't answer to the word of God then it doesn't line up with the word and we just leave it alone amen we don't go and talk about it we don't go and persecute it we just leave it alone step aside and just pray for that brother pray for that sister pray for that maybe Oh My Angel sometimes pastors can get off a little bit yes the humans We're Not Angels let's just bow in prayer tonight gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your goodness to each and every one of us we thank you for this book lord this this word that you've given us the exposition of the seven Church ages and and Lord we don't esteem it greater than your word there's
