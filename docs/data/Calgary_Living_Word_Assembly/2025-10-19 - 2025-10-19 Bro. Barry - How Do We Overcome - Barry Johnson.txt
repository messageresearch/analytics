[Music] God bless each one of you once again. God bless you. Welcome into the house of the Lord and trust the Lord's been good to you through the week. And here we are this morning once again this Sunday morning here to give him praise, give him glory, give him honor. He's worthy of so much more. I was thinking this morning as we we talk about a sacrifice of praise. That's what the the word says. But I was thinking about the Old Testament and the sacrifice that they had to make and the ritual and all the work they had to do to come to the the temple. on the on the Sabbath day. A lot of work, a lot of sacrifice, had to get the right lamb, had to kill it, and and all the all the various rituals that went forth with the priest. All we have to do this morning is praise him. I thought, wow, we got we got we get we got a pretty easy time here. We're just here to praise him just as a small word. But we're here to praise the Lord. And that's uh that's what we'll we'll start this the service this morning with. I'll enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart. And I'll just encourage you, give him the praise that you feel he deserves this morning. Well, I will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart. I will enter his courts with praise. Well, I will say this is the day that the Lord has made. I will rejoice for he has made me glad. Oh yes, he has made me glad. He has made me glad. I will rejoice for he has made me glad.

[Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Shall we bow our heads? Father God in heaven, the maker of heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; We come before you, Lord, not because we are anything, but because you have made us something, Lord. &gt;&gt; You reached down into the God hand. You raised us up. You justified us. You sanctified us. And Lord, we are here to give you praise, to give you honor, to give you all the glory that is due to your matchless and wonderful name. Father, Lord, the enemy may have tried to distract us during during this past week. May have tried to put pressures on us. May may have tried to make us forget your word. But Lord, we are here as a reminder to the devil whose side we are on. Lord, we we we thank you, Father God, &gt;&gt; for what you have done for us, &gt;&gt; for for the big things and for the little things. &gt;&gt; We thank you for even the trials &gt;&gt; that you have sent to us, Father God, to hone us into the people that you want us to be, for your soon coming, &gt;&gt; Lord, as we are here in this temple today. Father God, may you inhabit our praise. &gt;&gt; May you inhabit our glory that we have given to you, Lord. And father God, may you bless the word that you are bringing through your minister today, Father. Lord, may you bless the song leader. May you bless the musicians, Lord. Lord, may every aspect of this service be a sweet smelling savor to you, Lord. And Lord, may may not one person here live here the same way that they came here. May lives be changed. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; May miracles happen in in people's hearts &gt;&gt; that Lord, they would leave here with a renewed sense of vigor &gt;&gt; to live for you during the week. &gt;&gt; Lord, may may the anointing that is here right now that we feel. May he go with us in our schools and in our workplaces. And may our lives be the salt of the earth so that the people around us will know that this person is a Christian. Lord bless us Lord and thank you father God for we know that you are here &gt;&gt; we pray and ask all these things in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe shake someone's hand as you're seated this morning. Going to be part of the collective bride of the Lord Jesus this morning. All the licks of fire. Not just embers but licks of fire. Blessed be the name of the Lord. the Holy Ghost himself living in each of us. What a tremendous work of grace he's brought to each of us this morning. God is good all the time. If you're walking through the valley and there are shadows all around. Oh, do not fear for he will guide you. He will keep you safe and sound for he [Music] will save you and his word is true.

[Music] Thank you, Lord. Singing that last stanza, it just brings you to tears when you think about Brother Brandham's testimony of him going past the curtain. He said, "Some blind wouldn't touch it. Amazing. Wouldn't touch it. It was beyond anything you could describe with English language." And that's where we're headed. I was talking to my grandkids driving to to to church this morning. The millennium, the white throne, and the beautiful city of God. We have a tremendous future ahead of us. The the the future is bright for the children of God. Blessed be his name. Oh Lord, you're beautiful. How could we not sing this this morning? Oh Lord, you're beautiful. I don't think that's a right song. 893. Sorry, 8:26. I'm sorry. Sorry, I jumped a song. I'm sorry, brother. 8:26. Oh Lord, you're beautiful. Oh, your face is all I see. For when your eyes are on this child, your grace abounds to me. Stand with me if you would. Deacons when you come. Oh Lord, please light the fire that was burned bright and clear. Yes, Lord. We want more of you, Lord. Glory to the lamb of God and with [Music] your beautiful is all I see. Oh, your eyes are all [Music] for your [Music] Amen. Let's bow our heads and hearts. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord for each life &gt;&gt; bowed here in surrender to you today. Father, Father, my hear my ears hear victory in their voices. Father, &gt;&gt; I hear joy. I hear peace. Father, I hear thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; What an atmosphere already here today, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for your presence. Thank you, Lord, for this opportunity, Father, to tell you how much we love you. &gt;&gt; To join one in accord, Father, &gt;&gt; under your word for this day, Father, this overcoming word, Father. Lord, Father, we ask that you forgive us in our shortcomings this week, Father. Opportunities that presented themselves, Lord, and we failed to apply your word. Forgive me, Lord. We just desire, Father, to walk in the word, Father, for this day, Father, to shine it so bright, Lord. We can't do it ourselves, Father. Lord, and we just stumble and fall constantly, Lord, but thou knowest our heart love. We love you, Father. We love this word, this perfect word, Father. We love your body, Lord. Thank you for this service, Lord. one more moment, Father, that we can hold in our hands, Father, to show you and tell you how much we love you, to sit at your feet, Father, and to be circumcised once again by your word, Father. Lord, over and over again until, Father, there's none of this flesh left, Father. That the revelation, Father, won't be able to be contained in these mortal bodies, Father, that we'll just walk home. &gt;&gt; Father, there's nothing more that I want &gt;&gt; out of this life, Father, &gt;&gt; than to see your word made manifest, Father. I love you, Father. &gt;&gt; The battle's raging, Lord. &gt;&gt; And we just hide and stand in your word. &gt;&gt; And time and time again, Lord, &gt;&gt; you come on the scene and you make it manifest. &gt;&gt; And we stand with a testimony. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; that you're real. &gt;&gt; You're in the earth that's bride form. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father, for each life. Father, help us, Lord. I pray &gt;&gt; as the word comes forth, Father, may it find a resting place in our hearts, Lord. May it not just be church service, Lord, but understanding. We're being changed, &gt;&gt; but the renewing of our mind. Wash us Aresh, Lord. We bring our tithes and offerings, Lord. Thank you, Father, for what you've given. &gt;&gt; And we freely give it back, Father, with thanksgiving in our hearts, knowing that it will serve your purpose. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. By his grace I am redeemed. [Music] By his blood I am made and I now can go [Music] face to face. Yeah. I [Music] will praise the glory of his grace. for master. Oh, by his grace I am great. [Music] I am I made and I can go [Music] to fest [Music] I have [Music] Oh Christ. [Music] I will praise the glory [Music] of [Music] we come into your presence to sing a song to you. a song of praise and honor for all the things you've brought us through. You gave a life worth living and I love you and now I just love giving all of my praisees back to you. You're the father of creation. You're the Lamb of God, you're the one who walked away from that empty. And you set your people free with love and liberty. So I can walk with you every night and every day. Every night and every day. As our pastor comes, we come into your presence to sing a song to you, a song of praise and honor. All the things you've helped us through. You gave a life worth living. And I'm in love with you. And now I just stop giving all my praises back to you. You're the power of creation. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] and God bless you this morning. Welcome to the house of the Lord. Each and everyone an honor and a privilege to gather together with you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; If you have a need this morning, we just want to bring it before the throne. We have a couple of requests that we want to remember as well as an assembly. First one is for Mr. Johnson Chick. Apparently that is a a client of Sister Stella and uh it's a a real struggle. The doctor has given him a date to live and told his wife to go and pray since his wife believes in prayer. And uh so we just want to stand with his wife &gt;&gt; and sister Stella in prayer for Mr. Johnson Chick as well. It uh it kind of I guess it was shared this week on Friday that uh Sister Anderson passed away. Sister Anderson is uh Charles, brother Charles Anderson's wife and that is brother Cadre Dick's pastor in Columbia, South Carolina. So we just want to stand with Charles family and or sorry the Anderson family and the and the assembly there. It certainly is a a tumultuous time for a family losing a loved one. So, let's just go to him in prayer this morning. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you that we can gather together this way. Lord Jesus, we know that the days are numbered, that we're going to be able to do this. And we thank you for this opportunity, Lord. We don't take it lightly. This is not religion. This is not something that we just do, not something that we try and mix with anything else, Father. This is us stripping ourselves of all of our own thinking, Lord Jesus, and coming into that place, Lord Jesus, beyond the veil. Father, we thank you for the opportunity that we can do that, Lord. And this morning, Lord, we just remember each and every request that was made known unto you by the way of an uplift hand. We hold those requests before your throne this morning, Lord, knowing that you hear them and knowing that you're more than able to meet each and every one, Father, sovereignly according to your will, which is your word. And Father, this morning, we just want to stand with the Anderson family and the congregation. Lord, knowing that they've lost a saint, lost a husband or a wife and a and a mother, Lord Jesus, maybe a grandmother and an aunt. We know that there's many, many lives that have been affected by this passing, Lord. And we just want to stand with each one, Father. We know that you know best, Lord, in every situation. And we just want to ask, Father, that you would strengthen and comfort each and every one affected by this passing. Lord Jesus, we just want to stand with Mr. Johnson Chick and his wife, Lord, in prayer this morning that you would sovereignly meet the need in their life, Lord. &gt;&gt; Mr. Johnson needs a touch from you, Father. And we know that you're more than able. And Father, we know that it doesn't matter what anyone else says or thinks. Your word says that by your stripes we are healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that we were healed. It says it both ways. And we thank you, Father, that you've covered it in all directions. And Lord Jesus, we pray that they could just accept it the way that you've given it. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, this morning now, as we commit these needs into your hands, Father, and we change the order of the service, we just invite you, Father, to have the preeminence in this service. Lord, it's a bit cloudy outside and dismal as the seasons change, Father. But Lord, we just know that just beyond this cover of clouds, Lord, the sun is shining, &gt;&gt; eternal, bright, and fair. And Lord Jesus, not even so much in the natural, but truly in the spiritual, Lord Jesus. This is truly the rising of the sun. And Father, we're so thankful for that dynamic power. We just invite you, Lord, now to have the preeminence in all that we say and do in this service. And at the end, we'll be careful to give you praise. &gt;&gt; We love you and we thank you. We just commit each need and each life into your hands now for your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, musicians. Once again, if you have your Bibles, I'd like to read from Revelations chapter 3. Revelations chapter 3. We're certainly thankful to have the youth event this afternoon. We're going to host it at our house. We'll be having lunch and uh a bit of a bit of a conversation about the word and just some fellowship. Remember the communion service on the 26th at 5:30 and uh the youth service here in the sanctuary at the church on the 31st and that will be at 7:30 as well. And we also have brother Cadre Digs coming Saturday on the 22nd of November and Sunday the 23rd at 10 a.m. And the Saturday service will be at 6 PM. Revelations chapter 3 verse 20. Actually, we'll read verse 19. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. Be zealous, therefore, and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him, and will s with him, and he with me. To him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my father in his throne. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. &gt;&gt; May God add a blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated today. &gt;&gt; Just like to start the service today with a little reminder and a thank you all at the same time. We have uh a few questions that have come in. I mentioned it probably earlier in the summer, maybe even in the spring. I can't remember when I first mentioned it, but uh questions, if you have questions, please by all means write them down and submit them into the deacons or into the offering. If you just want to remain anonymous, that's fine. Um but if you if you write down questions, then we can actually find answers. And uh brother Brandham talks about how it's actually an opportunity to understand what's in the heart of the believers. &gt;&gt; If we have questions, there has to be answers. And I trust that the questions would be spiritual questions where there would actually be spiritual answers. There's natural questions and we can come up with all kinds of different natural answers because we have many varying opinions on natural circumstances. But uh sometimes there's natural questions and that's just fine. There's nothing wrong with that. But we uh we are certainly interested in the spiritual questions. If you have any, by all means. Um any questions, just write them down. We have a few and I want to just remind everyone that we have them. We haven't forgotten about them. I think I have a total of five of them right now. And I believe that, you know, if I took a service and started to talk about them, I would probably be able to, you know, deal with all four of them in the first 10 or 15 minutes and not have enough time for maybe the fifth one. So, I just want to try and get a whole bunch together and we'll do uh we'll do some some real good uh discussions about it. You know, uh just a reminder about this youth service coming up for anyone that's interested. It's all about the youth and uh anyone that wants to come, you're certainly welcome to come, but it's not going to be uh an opportunity for inputting and and seeing if we can help with how we're going to do it. We're going to do it in a very specific way. And I uh I reserve the right to actually be sort of leading the way this is going. And I think that it's actually a tremendous opportunity for the youth. But the question was raised just now. Is it for everyone? And it certainly is. Anybody that wants to come, Halloween night is just the the night for the devil. It's a celebration of the evil in this world. And if you don't want to actually be a part of that or look at that, maybe if you don't have something else to do, come to church. You're certainly welcome to &gt;&gt; you. We did uh last time we had uh we had probably three or four or five adults in the back. &gt;&gt; If there's more, forgive me. I was probably one of the juveniles. I'll say it that way. But we had the stage was full of the youth and uh we just played. There was no practice. There was no studying. There was no doing anything to try and and perform. It was simply who can play the piano, who can play the guitar, who can play the organ. And everyone volunteered, came up and we said, "Okay, let's sing this song." And guess what we did? We actually sang that song. And for those people that were here, you know full well the presence of the Lord came into the building with that worship. And it wasn't perfect by any means, but that's exactly what we're after because it's not perfection as we would think that actually brings the spirit of the Lord. It's surrender that actually does it. So, speaking to the youth service specifically, if anybody wants to come, you're certainly more than welcome to come. And if you do come, you're welcome to come and worship. And that's what's going to happen. We'll have uh a little bit of an exhortation as well as some songs. And uh maybe we'll have a little treat afterwards. We had a a little treat late after the last one. It was really good in the basement there. So, are you happy this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm uh certainly interested in the service today because I feel uh I feel like we can't go on feelings. It's really bizarre. Anybody have a hard week this week? It it it was it was not an easy week. And and you know, I can see hands going up and people nodding. Is that Brother Wilner? Brother, God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Wilner. Welcome. Amen. I thank the Lord. You know, I had such a strong feeling about Brother Wilner this morning in prayer and here he is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's wonderful. God bless you, brother. That's tremendous. My I just had uh a hard week as well. And uh we're certainly certainly cognizant of uh conscious of the struggle and the battle. And you know, it's not necessarily just one person that goes through it. When one goes through it, we all go through it. And I know that when the devil's coming around hard against me, he's coming after the sheep as well. And it's it's a difficult thing. But we're certainly thankful that we can get together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and know that he is here in our midst. I mean, where else would we rather be? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the presence of the king. My my my. This morning, I want to I want to talk about overcoming. &gt;&gt; And uh I just I guess I'm going to blend sort of the youth uh event today maybe and uh we'll just carry on a little bit with it at home when we when we meet afterwards. But I want to talk about overcoming and what it means to overcome. And you know, sometimes we can think about overcoming and we think about all of the struggles that we have in our lives and and the individual affairs that we have to go through. And you know, as we struggle and fight, we have to overcome them. And sometimes we don't actually overcome them, but what we do is go into another day. We go to sleep and and the problems seem to fade away and we go into a dream and we wake up in the morning and and we just feel better. The problems of yesterday were yesterday and now we have a brand new day. We have an opportunity to go forwards with a a clear mind and and maybe just an opportunity to look at things a little bit differently. Sometimes just a little bit of sleep goes a long long ways. &gt;&gt; But you know the greatest battleground is where? It's right here, right? It's right there. It's in the mind. That's the greatest battleground because what we do in our lives is we just make decisions. That's what we do in our lives. We're decision makers. &gt;&gt; From the moment that we wake up to the moment that we go to sleep, we are making decisions. And when we go to sleep, we're no longer making decisions. And don't get nervous. I'm not trying to get psychological. I'm not at all doing that. But what I am saying is that we are free moral agents. &gt;&gt; And he's created us to be that way, to be decision makers. We he we are created in his image to be the actual God of this earth. &gt;&gt; He's the God of the universe. But he placed man on earth in his very image to be able to till the soil to to to look after the garden. But we know through the fall we find ourselves in this circumstance and situation that we're living in where we have all of the struggles, all of the trials, all of the humanity that we have to somehow try and get over. And it's not always easy. But I think that we have uh just a real interesting key here. And I really strongly felt led to go this way today. So, I'm just trusting the Lord with it. And and that is that we have an opportunity to overcome, but it might it just might not be exactly as we suppose. It might not be about overcoming smoking and about overcoming drinking. I I I just want to start with saying that it's really truly, I believe, overcoming ourselves. &gt;&gt; It's about being able to lay down our will. &gt;&gt; Amen. and say, "Be it unto me according to thy word &gt;&gt; which is your will." &gt;&gt; But out of out of the church age book to our scripture today that we read out of our church age book, the church age book, the exposition of the seven church ages, the overcomer's throne out of the Leodysian church, and that is what brother Brham talked about in Revelations 3:21. To him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even as I also overcame. How did he overcome? &gt;&gt; It was all the way to death. &gt;&gt; But it never would have happened if he would have fought it in the garden of Gethsemane. Would it? That's where the victory truly was won. When he laid down his will, his self-will to the will of the father. When he laid that down, the victory was won. The rest of it was all it just needed to take place. Now I am no way demeaning, belittling what Jesus went through from that point at all because I don't think any other human could actually do what he did. There's no way. But it wouldn't have happened if he didn't lay down his will. &gt;&gt; Even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne. Now, this is what I want to get into. I remember brother Ken preaching on this and it just it just really struck me. As I said before this week, I'm just getting a little bit uh I don't know, melancholy. I guess this time of year just does that to me. But here here, brother Bradom, he says, "Now, what are we to overcome?" That is the normal question to ask here. But that is not the actual thought of this verse. For it is not so much what we are to overcome, but how we are to overcome. &gt;&gt; And so this is really where I'm going to go with the youth this afternoon and and with the youth right here now. All of us being youth because we're his children, right? &gt;&gt; I want to talk about this because it's not all about what we overcome. Many times we'll say, "Oh, I had this and I had that and I've got this and I've got that and and all these other things to overcome." It's got nothing to do with it. What has to do with is how we do it. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes we even said it on Wednesday. How many people have ever been sick and not been healed? There was hands that went up. People believe that they haven't been healed. But I want to say maybe you have been, but maybe just not in a way that you think. &gt;&gt; And this is the critical factor here. &gt;&gt; Even Paul had a discussion about this. We're going to get into it, but we're just going to keep keep going with this quote here. He says it's not so much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome. Now this is logical for it does not matter ho matter much what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome. It's such a critical thing to know that we have been given the ability to overcome in this age. There's a group of people that have been given the ability to overcome in every single age. There's a group of people that have been given the ability to overcome. Because at the end of every single ages exhortation in the book of Revelation, he says, "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church. He that hath an ear," only those people that hath an ear will be able to overcome. But there's overcomers in every single age. And every single age he does give the correction for that age. If people have an ear, they will hear it. Carrying on in this quote, brother Brandham says, "A quick look at these scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition." In Matthew chapter 4, wherein Jesus is tempted of the devil, he overcame the personal temptations of Satan by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love this. And by the word only. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not by some kind of external psychological teaching or not some kind of external medical teaching. It's neither one of those things. It's only by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, while we have some time still, I just need to make sure I can see the the time here. Boy, we got lots of time today. &gt;&gt; Let's turn over to Matthew. Matthew chapter 4. Matthew chapter 4. Maybe we'll start with chapter 3. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 3, but verse 16. Boy, I just want to read it all. Let's go back to 14. Jesus going to John the baptizer. We know that John was actually the he was the uh messenger to the age. He was the prophet to the age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that he was the Elijah anointing for that age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that he said in that age that I must decrease so that he can increase. The one that I'm not worthy to latch the shoes. The one that is standing amongst you now. He he identified him in many different ways, but he said that that when he comes on the scene, I I've got to decrease so that he can increase. And we know that same anointing hit this earth. And we know the same thing happened on this earth in a spiritual way, not in a natural way. Jesus has not walked on this earth again. We know that he won't touch his feet on this earth again until the actual uh Revelations chapter 19. I'm just going to throw this out there. I just I'm sorry, but if anybody has a cell phone, can you just check it and make sure that it's off? Just make sure our phones are off. I I don't believe that we should really need to say it, but sometimes we we notice that it happens. So, just check cell phones and make sure they're turned off. But here, John in verse 14, it says, "But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?" You want you want you want to be baptized by me, but I need to be baptized by you." And Jesus answering said unto him, "Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he suffered him. And he just needed to follow the scripture because of Acts 2:38. But they didn't actually understand that yet at that time. But Jesus being a fulfillment of the word, he needed to actually exemplify that. And verse 16 says, "And Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water, and lo, the heavens were open unto him, and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove, and light lightning upon him. And lo, a voice from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved son in whom I am &gt;&gt; well pleased." &gt;&gt; What a tremendous scripture. And I believe that's the desire of every single son and daughter of God. verse 17 is to hear him say that this is my beloved son. This is my beloved daughter in whom I am well pleased. Now, now chapter 4 is what I want to get to. But you know, chapter 4 wouldn't have happened unless there was this ending part of chapter 3. Jesus, a God in flesh. He was still a man. He was all man. Brother Bradam said that he was all man, but he was all God. How &gt;&gt; how do you explain that? Some people just have it nailed down. They can scientifically describe it within the message of the hour. Exactly how he was all God and exactly how he is all man. And those are the guys that can explain the Godhead to infinity and beyond. So far that they will confuse themselves. But we have Jesus going and getting baptized according to the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus was a son that had to be obedient. &gt;&gt; Jesus couldn't do it without following the father's will. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful to think the King of Kings would come down and actually do it first himself? &gt;&gt; That's why it's wonderful when you have a boss. Maybe like brother Paul, sometimes you can own a company and you get busy running the company and dealing with all of the aspects of the company. And many times you get staff that you hire to work in the company. and the staff that work in different positions in the company. I I I'll say this maybe beneath you, but not so much beneath you, but just upholding different parts of the business that you can't possibly manage yourself. You get people doing that. And sometimes those people can get a little bit of a a chip on their shoulder and and believe that they're the ones actually making the company and not realizing that the guy that started the company, he actually did that. Once upon a time, that's what he did. But every once in a while, we were having this conversation a little while ago. I hope it's okay, brother Paul. Every once in a while, it's really good for the boss to actually take the suit off and actually put on the gloves and go down and get right in the trenches and show everyone that he knows exactly what's going on. &gt;&gt; He knows what's happening. He knows how this happens. There's no surprises to him. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the rest of the staff can look around and say, "Wow, he he does know it." Okay. It it's it's it creates credibility amongst the people. But to think about it as a Christian, as a believer, to think that God himself would come down in flesh &gt;&gt; and be tempted in all points, in all ways that we would be tempted &gt;&gt; and then be able to lay down his will for us &gt;&gt; for our deliverance. &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful here. The the footnote of my Bible says the temptation of Jesus. First, he got the baptism of the Holy Ghost, right? It says that he did in the Bible, but in in chapter 4:1 says, "Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil." I think it's beautiful. It's just like Revelations chapter 4, isn't it? John, he was shown an open door in heaven &gt;&gt; and immediately he was in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Verse two. And when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights, he was afterward and hungered. And And this is one that stumbles me. I I I I it doesn't stumble me that I don't believe it. It just stumbles me to think that I could ma barely make it for three days, two days without food. Some days even one day without food. But here Jesus was, how long did it say there? He fasted 40 days and 40 nights. He was afterward hungry. He got his flesh to the weakest point that he probably could under his own will. 40 days and 40 nights. And I know there's a real significance with that. I'm not going to dig into that. There's brother brothers that could probably do a way better job than than me. But verse three, when the tempter came to him, he said, "If thou be the son of God, command that these stones be made bread." And we know that he was actually quoting scripture to Jesus. He wasn't just saying willy-nilly, I just want to tempt you. He was actually bringing the word to the word. &gt;&gt; But you're not going to fool the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Verse four says, "And he answered and said, it is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God." &gt;&gt; I think it's just amazing how we we can look at this and see this was the the the lust of the flesh. absolutely desiring to eat something. His flesh was probably just about imploding. He was so hungry. Maybe he was so hungry, he was well beyond hungry. He didn't even have any hunger. But the Bible says he was hungry. &gt;&gt; He was really really hungry. And and here the devil comes around and tries to throw scripture at him and say, you know, you could you could just make these stones bread and kaboom, you would be able to eat. You would break this this fasting that you're doing, this fasting nonsense, and you'd actually have the food. you'd be satisfied in your flesh. Go for it. But he said, "No, no, no. The word says that you know what? Man shall not live by bread alone." And he wasn't here to live by bread alone, was he? He was here to live by every single word. And so is it with the believer today, brothers and sisters. We're here to live by every single word that that proceedth out of the mouth of God. And then the devil, verse 5, taketh him into an holy city, and setth him upon a on a pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto him, If thou be the son of God, cast thyself down. For it's written, he shall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. And we know this is Psalms 91:11. Jesus said unto him, "It is written again, thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." He didn't bring his own thoughts, even though they probably were his own thoughts because he was God. He brought the word. He didn't bring something new or different. He actually brought the word back to the word, back to this perversion of the word that the devil was bringing around to him. And we know that this this is the lust of the flesh. The first one, verse four, verse 7, is is dealing with the the lust of the eyes. And we know the next one is probably the the greatest and biggest one that every single one of us has to deal with. Verse 8 says again, "The devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, and saith unto him, all these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down, and worship me." And we know that right at that point, he was a scammer. That's what we would call a scammer today, isn't it? I'm going to give you something that I don't have. He He had no authority over it. We know that he was given it just for a time, but it was never his to begin with. And it was never his to remain. &gt;&gt; It was only that title deed book that was actually taken out of the hand of man and and given back to God. But it was never given to Satan. &gt;&gt; He never had claim to that title deed. But he wants it. He wants it bad &gt;&gt; and he can never have it. &gt;&gt; But it's interesting because this is the the pride of life. this one here, seeing all of the kingdoms of the world, going to an exceeding high mountain and and showing him the kingdoms of the world and and declaring that he has the power and authority to give to him. And he knew full well that it had to be only by the blood, only by his life, only by his sacrifice. The lamb of God was the only way these kingdoms of the world were going to be restored. Then Jesus saith unto him, "Get thee, hence, Satan, for it's written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve." &gt;&gt; And I just love this because I think this is a a a direct comparison to the life of a believer. When we go through our temptations, we will go through temptations, but we will overcome. &gt;&gt; And the reason we'll overcome is because he's already overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Jesus got baptized, because he went into the wilderness, because he fasted, because he had these temptations and overcame by the word. He gave us the example himself of how to overcome. &gt;&gt; Verse 11 says, "Then the devil leaveth him." There comes a day, brothers and sisters, where the devil will leave us. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that the devil won't even know what to do with us. He said, "Sometimes the devil, he won't even be able to find you because you'll be so far hid in Christ." &gt;&gt; I say that's where I want to live. &gt;&gt; I I just want to be in a place where he can't even find me. &gt;&gt; So hid in Christ, but I guess I'm I'm still not hidden enough. &gt;&gt; My But you know, I think it's getting it's getting better and better as we go. The word is is working mightily in me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that our testimony today? &gt;&gt; No matter what the circumstance &gt;&gt; of what I feel &gt;&gt; or see. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter, does it? &gt;&gt; But it does matter. And I'll say it because we deal in this world. We're dealing with this world in our flesh. And many times we have circumstances and situations where we know the clock is ticking. And if something doesn't happen by a certain amount of time, Lord, do you want us to perish? &gt;&gt; I'll say this, maybe he does just a little bit in his flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Maybe he does just to get us to come right back to center again. &gt;&gt; Because we know that in Revelation it said, "Those I love I rebuke and I chasen." How does that happen? Natural circumstances. &gt;&gt; He allows things to happen in our life so that we will look to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I love this quote here. I just wanted to make sure that we read this here and talk a little bit about it out of Matthew chapter 4. A quick look at these scriptures. Brother Brandham speaking in the Leodysian church age involve uh a quick look at these scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in Matthew 4 where Jesus is tempted of the devil. He overcame the personal temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In each of the three major trials that correspond, I love this exactly to the temptation of the Garden of Eden, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life. Jesus overcame by the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just turn over to re uh Genesis here. Being that we have all this time, &gt;&gt; I love it. Thank you, whoever put the new clock in. We certainly appreciate all that everyone does for the body. It really makes a difference. Genesis Genesis chapter 2 actually no three. Genesis 2 talks about how God formed the the man of and and the woman and and gave Adam the woman and uh talks about the verse 24 of of chapter 2. Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh. We know this was the first wedding that took place ever. And it was ordained of God in the garden. And uh it's why the husband doesn't hold on to his parents, his mother, and and bring that relationship into the marriage. And the wife, she doesn't hold on to the relationship with her father and bring that into the marriage. It's just a man and a woman leaving their parents and coming together and becoming their own family, becoming one together. And and verse 25 says, "And they were both naked, man and his wife, and were not ashamed." It's it's a wonderful thing to know that that's the way it was in the garden. They were not ashamed. And uh we know that chapter 3 had to happen unfortunately, but it's it's the reason why we're here. We're we're we're we're in a situation where we can overcome. This isn't to destroy us. This is to give us overcoming power, a a recognition that we will actually overcome. And I think it's just amazing when we look at this how how how God does stuff, you know. When brother Brandham, he says, I just want to say this out of the quote that we read, in each of the three major trials corresponding exactly to the temptation in the garden of Eden, the lust of the flesh, lust of the eye, and pride of life, Jesus overcame by the word. Now, chapter 3 says, "Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made." And that word subtle is is interesting. I uh boy now I I went and did it. I messed it up. I'll find it. But the serpent was more subtle than any beast of a field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, "Ya hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden." So car I'll just carry on. Verse two says, "And the woman said unto the serpent, we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die." And the serpent said unto the woman, "Ye shall not surely die. For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be open, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. And here's the temptation now manifesting in the woman. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, the lust of the flesh, pleasant to the eyes, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes. Yep. It was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, the pride of life. She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and also gave unto her husband with her, and he did eat. You know, in this in this scripture here, it's it's very very condensed. And I'm so thankful that we have been given the ability to understand that we need to read between the lines and you know not read between the lines according to human knowledge and and human understanding and and and the consciousness of human awareness but to actually read by the spirit. It has got to be revelation by the spirit. And if we don't have revelation by the spirit, we're going to miss it. We're going to read this and we're going to have knowledge and say, "Yeah, the woman saw that it was it was good for food and and it was it was a piece of fruit and that's what they did." But, you know, she took of the fruit. What I want to get to, she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat. It almost sounds like she just gave it to him and and he just took it and and ate it and and because she gave it to him, he just went along with it. But that's not at all what happened. We know that that sure naturally speaking we can say that's what happened but he was not forced to take that fruit. We'll say it that way. He was not forced to just participate in what happened. He willingly participated in what happened &gt;&gt; just like a type of Jesus Christ coming down in the flesh getting baptized having the temptation and then fast forwarding going right to the garden of Gethsemane where he laid down his own will. Adam laid down his own will to step back from his first estate, to step out of eternity and step into time to save his bride who was actually a part of him. But he wasn't deceived. It was the woman that was deceived. Right? &gt;&gt; And we know that brother Brandham says the woman is a weaker vessel. And sometimes you can get people really uncomfortable with that. But that's the word of God. That's not something we're going to try and discern or or say anything against it or for it. It is what it is. It's it's just it's a spiritual thing. It's not a natural thing. Unfortunately, in this world that we live in, it's the world that we live in. There's some women that are stronger than men. Unfortunately, those men that don't eat foods right and try and act like women. Yeah, there's some women in this world that Anyways, I think it's interesting just to look at this here. We want to talk about overcoming than understanding that the only way we're going to overcome is to first be tempted. &gt;&gt; Why would we have to overcome if we didn't have temptation in our lives? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There would have to be a perfect condition, I think, if we didn't have to overcome. &gt;&gt; But we're not in that condition yet. I just think it's beautiful when we can see the the the the corresponding scriptures according to the way brother Brandham said it. how it's exactly, he says, an exact representation, an exact type of what happened in the Garden of Eden, what Jesus went through in Matthew chapter 4. You know, the the lust of the f of the flesh trying to trying to trying to get Jesus to to jump for some food. What a what a amazing thing that is. I I think it's just a beautiful thing because we can see clearly through that that the devil did not believe that was the son of God. &gt;&gt; The devil did not believe that Jesus was the son of God. I know we've talked about this in the past. That's why they put Jesus on the cross. They killed him because the devil never believed it. If the devil believed that, they never would have done it &gt;&gt; because that sealed his fate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and he knows it and so do we. It's just so beautiful when we can see it that way. But to try and tempt the son of man with some food, boy, and and and the lust of the eyes, to think that he could just be be thrown down off the temple and and somehow the angels of God would just surround him and prevent him from from from stumbling and falling and hurting himself. And then the pride of life, we know that brother Brandham said that power without character is satanic. And that's really what that is. Now, in the life of a human being outside of Jesus, because we know that he had all the character, but he had to learn obedience through the things that he suffered just like every one of us. There's no way that we're going to go through this life and just be handed a victory. There's no way that we're just going to get that character. That character is a victory. That character isn't just a gift that we're going to just we're not just given that that character as a gift from our church. We're not given that character as a gift from our parents. We don't get it from a lineage. We don't get it from tenure. It only comes by the things which we suffer &gt;&gt; only. And I I I I'm not saying it in a way today just so you know my heart as as a rebuke and as a punishment. I'm I'm saying it in such a way that we're all going to struggle. We're all going to fight. But it's important to recognize this is God's design. This is so that we can work us out of us and work him into us. &gt;&gt; Because in Revelation, in Revelation 4, we're talking about the Leodysian church age. Maybe let's just go back and and read this here uh uh from Revelations 3:14. Let's look at the condition of this church age. All of us, whether we understand it or not, whether we believe it or not, whether we see it or not, are coming out of this church age. Some people have already moved into the bride age and they can just say amen to this. They understand it fully. But some people are still stuck in this church age. And there's believers that are in this church age that are the bride of Jesus Christ. Because when that last predestinated seed comes in, then the rapture will go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what we're looking for today. But let's look at the condition of this church in all the church ages, the seventh one. And unto the angel of the church of the Leodysans, write these things, saith the amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. I know thy works. I know what you do. I know who you are. &gt;&gt; I know where you live. &gt;&gt; I know where you go to church. &gt;&gt; I know what you think. I know what you dream when your consciousness turns off. I know thy works. &gt;&gt; Amen. that thou art neither cold nor hot. I would thou weren't cold or hot. So then, because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Why will he do it? Because they're neither cold or hot. They're just indifferent. You know, whatever. I could take it or leave it. I could go to church or not. I could stream or not. I could believe it the way I want to believe it. This is the age of people's rights. The Leodysian church age is people's rights. That's what it means. We read that in the exposition of the seven church ages. People can do whatever they want. But those people who are truly elected will only do the will of the father. &gt;&gt; And the will of the father is going to be exactly according to the word of God, which is exactly according to the messenger for that age. &gt;&gt; Anything else is false. &gt;&gt; But he goes on to say in verse 17, and this is this is God, the spirit of God speaking to this age. &gt;&gt; This isn't just a man speaking. This isn't just John the Revelator just putting down his own thoughts. He's not just sitting on a on a beach in a beach chair with some smart water beside him having a scroll with his sunglasses on as some people might depict this. We know that he was on the aisle of Patmas for the testimony of Jesus Christ. Just before he went to this place where it was all of the criminals, he was boiled in oil for 24 hours. But I love what brother Brandham says. You can't boil the Holy Ghost out of nobody. just try it. And that's what they did with him. They tried to boil the Holy Ghost out of John. There was no doing it. Verse 16 says, "So then, because thou art lukewarm and neither hot or cold, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Don't want nothing to do with you." Why? Because in verse 17, because thou sayest, I am rich. I'm increased with goods, and I have need of nothing. and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked. But you know, it's interesting because in this scripture here, we can read this scripture here and say, well, there's a lot of people I don't think that there's anybody in this world that would be really walking around in this world. Not many people, there's a few. I'm I'm catching myself as I'm saying this, but there's not a lot of people that are walking around poor and blind and naked in this world, are there? And we know that he's not talking about the people maybe who are misfortunate and standing on the roadside with a sign hoping that that someone will help them out. Maybe they don't have winter clothes. Maybe they are naked and poor and maybe they are blind. But those people are very few and far between. Who's he talking to? He's talking to the people that are wearing suits, that are wearing ties, that are wearing lovely, call them tight minikirts, going to churches with high heels and earrings, acting like everything is fine because their bank accounts are full. They've got the the investments, their jobs, their their pensions, everything is fine. Maybe they've got a great inheritance coming down the pipes. All of their life is wonderful. &gt;&gt; But he's not looking at that. &gt;&gt; He's looking at the inward person. He's looking at that soul and he's telling them, "Your soul fits this description." &gt;&gt; Your soul says, "I am rich and increased with goods. There's nothing that you could teach me in this message that I don't already know. I have need of nothing." What a terrible place to be. And know it's not. You don't even know that you Oh my. that you're wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked in the sight of God. We know that all things are naked in the in the sight of God, right? There's nothing hidden before God. He can see our innermost being. He knows every single thought. We know that our thoughts, even right now as we're here together in church, are louder in heaven than than maybe my voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But here's what he says in verse 18. I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raignment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear to think about it that he would actually give us raignnt he give us a robe and we know that in the book of revelation he talks about those people under the sixth seal you know excuse me the Jews that brother bam talked about those ones that were crying for retribution. How long, oh Lord, holy and true must we wait to see these people avenged? And he just gave him a white robe and said, "Just just relax. Take it easy. Just rest for a little season until your fellow brethren are killed just like you were." And we know that's 144,000 that have to be killed just like them. And that time is coming very soon. That time is approaching really, really fast. But to think that he would counsel those people. &gt;&gt; He would counsel those souls to buy of him gold. Not gold that we could find at a bank. Not the finest, purest gold that we could find on in some market somewhere in a world in in the world, somewhere that maybe you can't even find in North America. There's probably better gold somewhere in this world, but not even that we would find maybe in the universe on a on a comet going through space. There's no gold that we could buy. I think it's amazing how he says this to the church through this Leodysian church age messenger in the church age book. He says it very clearly. I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire. That gold is our character. And I I'll go so far as to say this. That gold isn't our character. It's his character. &gt;&gt; Amen. His character that gets smelted out of us that gets burned right out of us. Our character gets burnt out and his character comes to the surface. &gt;&gt; Our character is dross on the top. Isn't that amazing to think about? We have got to see ourselves burnt up completely. I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raignnt that thou mayest be clothed &gt;&gt; and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with Isav that thou mayest see. As many as I love I rebuke and I chasen. Be zealous therefore and repent. Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that Paul, the church age messenger, he did that. He was zealous for the Lord and he repented every single day. He said, "I die to myself daily. Now follow me as I follow Christ." That's what he said. And that's all we need to do is die out to ourselves. We got to be willing to die out to ourselves. &gt;&gt; So I think today it's wonderful as we talk about this. If we want to overcome, if we've got one speck of pride in our life, we're not overcoming. &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing to say it, but it's true. &gt;&gt; We've got to be willing to humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord if we want to be lifted up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know, pride, pride of life is the the first and original sin, isn't it? That's what the devil wanted. That's what Lucifer was looking to make himself just like the most high. He was going to exalt himself to there. And I I think it's so beautiful when we look at this because he wants our position. That's exactly where we are to go to, brothers and sisters, the position that the devil wants. And he can never have that. But to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne. We're not going to sit with him necessarily in a chair. It's not the great white chair that we're necessarily going to go and sit. Maybe we are. Maybe someone could correct me on that. But I believe it this way. And and I think it's important to say it that we're going to have the authority of his throne. &gt;&gt; We're going to be judging angels. &gt;&gt; So whether we're sitting with him in a chair or standing beside it or sitting in our own chairs is irrelevant. The fact of the matter is we're going to reign with him in his power and authority. &gt;&gt; Satan wants that position worse than anything. And he can never have it. And because of that, he persecutes the bride in the day in which we live. That's where we are. Brother Brandham in in our quotes here, he goes on to say a little further. Eve fell to the personal temptation of Satan. How he doesn't have it up yet. I'll just pause here. Eve fell to the personal temptation of Satan by failing to use the word That's how she fell simply by failing to use the word. Now I think this is really good because how how did that happen? She got out of her husband and she got away from her husband and she began to make decisions on her own without first consulting her husband. But had she stood behind her husband and actually it could have simply been behind her husband's word because she knew what her husband was told by God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've often wondered if she couldn't hear it while she was still yet a part of him because they weren't separated and God came and told them you can eat of every tree in the garden. They were still one created in the image of God. Both male and female created he them. They were one and God told them, "You can eat of any tree in the garden, but leave that one tree alone." So, she got out from behind her husband's word. She got out from behind her husband's leadership, and she fell to the temptation of Satan. &gt;&gt; She was deceived. And you know, I just think it's real easy for us as the church, if we get out from the leadership of our husband. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If we do that, we're going to be deceived. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, &gt;&gt; we're going to be deceived. We're going to come into a place where God will be able to mold us and shape us if we're truly his elected sons and daughters of God. And unfortunately, we've heard it said this way. It's like going through the knot hole in the fence sideways. It's unfortunate, but sometimes we need that. Eve, she fell to the personal temptation of Satan by failing to use the word. Adam fell in direct disobedience to the word. This is what the prophet is saying. I think it's just amazing when we can look at this because sometimes we can confuse these two. We can we can confuse whether we have direct disobedience to the word or whether we're deceived by the word. Sometimes we just don't know. And that's why we need to study the word. That's why we need to have revelation by the spirit &gt;&gt; because even sometimes as an elder we can say we've heard something a 100,000 times before but something struck me today and somehow it just resonated and it did something for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's a big difference between falling in direct disobedience to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. than being deceived and not knowing the word of God. And this is where the devil's playground is. I believe these two two two little sentences here. Eve fell by the personal temptation of Satan by failing to use the word. Adam fell into direct disobedience to the word. He actually chose to step out from his first estate and save his bride. Now I want to say today one of the questions that we have been asked is uh uh very similar to these lines and and I'm not going to preach on it today but I'm going to really answer it probably just this quickly. If you truly are a son and daughter of God, if we truly are sons and daughters of God, we will not directly disobey God. &gt;&gt; Now what is disobedience? I'm going to say it's unbelief because that's truly what it is. There's many attributes to it, but the main thing is unbelief is saying that I don't believe in the word of God. I don't believe in the prophet. I can take the entire message except for that one thing. That one thing is actually going to stop. All of the power of the message that we would have with the message will stop on that one thing. We've got to be willing to unreservedly accept it all. &gt;&gt; But you know what people do generally in the day in which we live? They'll say, "My, that guy was so good. But he had such a tremendous ministry, but he was really hard on women. He was a woman hater. Yeah. He wasn't a woman hater. He just stuck to the word of God. &gt;&gt; But the whole entire world has shifted and said, "Well, it's okay. Everyone's doing it. We can do this and get away with it. Sure enough, you can for a time." But boy, when the trial time comes, it's going to be important to know exactly where we stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if we're truly sons and daughters of God, then he will rebuke and chasen us if we're not getting any trials in our life. I wonder, are we even sons and daughters of God? But because Eve felt a personal temptation of Satan by failing to use the word, that doesn't mean that she was lost because Adam stepped out directly from his first estate to save her. And I want to say this. When we feel like we've fallen, when we observe that we've fallen, when we see that we've fallen, we haven't necessarily stepped away from believing the word of God. We've had temptation in our life. And that temptation has caused us to fall. And what we do is we get back up and we repent for our fall. We repent for our our sinful nature. We repent for the thing that we've encountered in our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what happened in the Garden of Eden. But Eve didn't even realize she was deceived. And immediately when she recognized what was going on, then it became fingerpointing, right? Well, it was the serpent that you gave us. And and and then and then Adam, well, it was the woman that you gave me. And we know how it all went down. But I just think it's really important for us to recognize that our Adam, Jesus Christ, that came down and actually got the Holy Ghost. He was born and in sin. He wasn't born in sin. He was born in this world. We were born in sin. We bypassed our theophony. And he didn't. He came in a position where he actually laid down his life just like Adam. And and he didn't fall, but he chose to lay his life down directly so that he could actually save us as his wife, just like Eve. In this in this quote here that we're reading, carrying on in the quote, brother Bradom, he says, "But Jesus overcame by the word." Eve fell to the personal temptation of Satan by failing to use the word. Adam fell in direct disobedience to the word. Jesus overcame by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And right now, let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the reason we're talking about this today, brothers and sisters, is I want to encourage us. There is a way to be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; And we can recognize that we can be the overcomers. In fact, we're not going to be one day. We already are if we're sons and daughters of God because he paid the price for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the way that I want to get to with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right now, let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer. And that way is by his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By his word, we are overcomers. &gt;&gt; And so what is his word? His word is his will. &gt;&gt; And when we talk about his word, could we take any portion of his word and leave it out &gt;&gt; and still actually be recipients, the full recipients of his word? We couldn't. I was having a conversation with brother this week about the different translations of the Bible and how critical is it brothers and sisters that we stick with the version that God used with his vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; The devil wants to creep into the framework of the Christian church and say it's okay to use an NIV. Don't worry about it. Just use the NIV. But how can you use a Bible that will just completely delete a verse? right &gt;&gt; in the book of John. I'm not going to get too far into it, but if you want to go and study it out, maybe text me later and I'll show you the exact chapter and verse. There's one verse in there that they've taken out completely. And I didn't really believe it when I first was shown it. I was like, "Wow, maybe that's just because it was a screenshot of a Bible app on a phone and and I thought, my goodness." So, I went and found the the NIV Bible that I was given. It was uh that man Rory Wilson, that man that died of a ALS. &gt;&gt; Remember me talking about him? He gave me his Bible and that's why I have it. I don't have it to study the NIV. But I remember growing up and it was you could have the King James, you could have the NIV. I know in our kids schools they've got the NIV and what could be wrong with it? Well, when you start taking verses out, everything is wrong. &gt;&gt; Take one verse out of the Bible and you're wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Jesus, he overcame by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So imagine if we have a word and we just take a verse out. &gt;&gt; How are we going to overcome? &gt;&gt; What's going to happen is we wind up with liberties. Oh well, you know, the word of God, it's it's okay. We can just do this. It's not okay. We can't just do that. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just think it's amazing that we have been given the direction that we can see there is a way &gt;&gt; to become an overcomer and and we said it already, but we are already overcomers by Christ who's already come and paid the price, laid down his life, rose again, died, buried, resurrected again, sat down on the right hand of God, the the majesty on high for all of us, one sacrifice once and for all. He's done that. But I think it's important for us to recognize that we have been given the ability to understand that we are overcomers also. And that's why I'm going on today, brothers and sisters. I want to encourage us to recognize that even though it feels a certain way, the prophet of God said, "Feelings have nothing to do with it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, the Holy Ghost is without sensation. It's not about a feeling and saying that I feel God and I don't feel God. He is where you are if you have his spirit. &gt;&gt; What's the identifier? We're going to get to it in in in what we read here today, but just just for the sake of discussion here, brother Bradom talks about being able to receive the word for what? &gt;&gt; Your day &gt;&gt; is the true evidence of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; For the people that want to say, well, I'll just take I won't take the King James version of Bible. I'll only take the or I won't take the NIV Bible. I'll only take the King James version Bible and and that's going to take me to Christ. It will take you to Christ. &gt;&gt; It will, but it might not take you in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't accept God's provided way for the day in which you live, you will not receive the blessing for that age. This age has been promised that in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, right? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; There shall be a body change. There's going to be something that takes place. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I I was looking at this and I I wanted to make sure that I wasn't I wasn't actually just throwing off on this and making something up that I I just thought I went back and checked it out and somebody asked Brother Brandham, "Will you go to heaven if you don't have the Holy Ghost?" If you want to see these questions, like I said, check out uh Conduct, Order, and Doctrine. There's some zingers in there. &gt;&gt; Will you actually be saved &gt;&gt; if you don't have the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Now, this is powerful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom, he says, "Yeah, sure. Sure, you'll be saved, but you won't go in the rapture." He says it very clearly in there. And and it's 100% right, isn't it? It's exactly like we talked about, I believe, on Wednesday about the Exodus. If we don't have the token, many people say they've got it, but the only way you're going to have it is to die out to yourself will allow his will to come forward in your life and say, "Be it unto me according to your word for this day. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as long as we're willing to do that, then he will actually manifest his life in our life. &gt;&gt; But we'll begin to see his life in our life. We know that. Brother Brandham preached it. I say it all the time. It's not just an invisible union of the bride of Jesus Christ. We begin to live a life that's consecrated to God. We don't smoke. We don't drink. We don't swear. We don't do all these different things that the worldly people did that we used to do. We don't we don't do that anymore when we're truly surrendered to the Lord. Brother Brandham, he says in this quote here also, it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word can't fail. &gt;&gt; Just going to go back and read the the last sentence, but Jesus overcame by the word. And right now, let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer. Also, it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word can't fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now, I just want to be clear, brothers and sisters. How are we overcoming? &gt;&gt; There's only one way to overcome, and that's to fully surrender to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we'll say it a few times as we as we finish up our last few minutes here. The word of God says that they overcame one way. By the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And by the testimony that they held. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how they overcame. &gt;&gt; That word can't fail. And you know, I think it's really important for us to recognize that when we have a prayer and we ask the Lord to give us the answer to our prayer according to his word. Maybe it's healing in our mind, maybe it's healing in our body. And and we don't see that actual prayer come to pass the way that we would like to see it come to pass. It's not necessarily a punishment. It's not necessarily uh anything other than a gift from God really. Because if we're able to believe this word, &gt;&gt; even going through that, &gt;&gt; what's happening? We're actually having a character that's molded and shaped in the fiery furnace. &gt;&gt; That is the character that we're going to get from that. &gt;&gt; But it only comes by that. That's the trouble as believers today that we we look at it and we think, "I'm failing because I've still got this. I'm failing because of that. I'm failing. there must be something wrong in my life because God's still allowing me to go through this. We're going to get to it in a little bit. Paul spoke to it very clearly. It's important. But, you know, just because we're going through something, brothers and sisters, it don't mean that we're failing. It don't mean that his word is not as powerful as it was ever. All it means is that he's shaping his character in our lives. &gt;&gt; And through that, through that alone, we are the overcomers. If we're still able to serve him as we go through those fiery trials, we can count it better than gold, better than the finest gold we'll ever find because it's truly his character. &gt;&gt; How many people in this world can go through the fiery trials and still love God, &gt;&gt; not walk away and say, "What kind of a God is that? He would let that happen. He would allow me to go through that. He would he would have this happen. He would have that happen." Many people would say, "Forget about it. It's crazy. Why would I do that? And outside of the Holy Ghost, who could blame him? &gt;&gt; Who could blame him? For us to be able to go through trials and still love him, that is the proof of overcoming, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just necessarily saying that we can disregard what the prophet said. I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying because we believe with all of our heart the word that's given to us in the day in which we live. We're given the ability to overcome these trials. And how do you overcome? You get back up. You dust yourself off. I know maybe I failed this week. Maybe I I feel like I let the Lord down. Maybe I let my wife down. Maybe I let somebody else down. Maybe I failed at my job. Maybe I did this. I did that. I did the other. But I still get up and I go to church and I let the Lord know whose side I'm on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The young people, we're going to talk about it this afternoon. Because you see people polished up in church, don't think for a second that those souls are not scarred battlecard veterans. &gt;&gt; They have gone through the trenches. They understand what it means to make a fool of yourself. They understand what it means to have to go and eat crow and apologize. They understand what it means to rectify situations &gt;&gt; that are extremely awkward, &gt;&gt; but they still serve God. &gt;&gt; They're still coming to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think what we're talking about, brothers and sisters, is a bit of a spiritual barometer. Brother Brandham talks about understanding here. He says it's also the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word can't fail. So, I want to say this. If we want to know if we're overcoming, where's your stand on the word of God today according to the seventh angel messenger? I believe that message with all my heart. It doesn't matter what comes my way or I'm just a little bit not sure. If you're just a little bit not sure, I want to say to you today, God is still working on our character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's still a little ways to go, but it doesn't mean you're lost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's already stepped out from eternity and paid our fair. All we've got to do is accept it the way that he's given it to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if we have a little bit of a doubt about this message of the hour, he's still working on us. Aren't you thankful today that he's still working on us? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let that be a curse. Let it be a blessing. Something is causing us to be attracted to this word of God in the day in which we live. That's such a tremendous thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, there's only one way that we're going to get the right results. And we're not going to do it our own way and get the victory. We're not going to say that I'll take the message of the hour and I'll just hybridize it just a little bit with my Pentecostal upbringing. I'll just take it and I'll hybridize it just a little bit with my whatever the adjective is, whatever the denomination is, upbringing, whatever it is, my traditions, my teachings, my theories, my thinkings, I'm just going to be able to blend it a little bit and bring that in and it's going to be okay. It will not be okay. &gt;&gt; That is poison. &gt;&gt; That's the That's exactly what Satan did with Eve in the Garden of Eden. one word off &gt;&gt; caused her to actually be deceived. &gt;&gt; We're not going to do it our own way today to get the right results to get the victory. And remember that victory isn't something that I do like a video game or a a challenge where I get to the next level and when I get there I've got a victory and when I can get to the next level I get a victory and then I can move on to the championships and then I've got the victory. We're not talking about that at all. We're talking about actually going through a fiery trial. &gt;&gt; Amen. finding ourselves at the hospital and saying, "Be it unto me according to thy will. Be it unto me according to thy word. If you want me to raise up, then you're going to raise me up. &gt;&gt; I can't tell you to raise me up. &gt;&gt; But I can say I believe your word with all my heart." &gt;&gt; And if you want me to live another day, then you're going to make me live another day. And there ain't no devil in hell that's going to stop that. But to go through a fiery trial and still love the Lord, &gt;&gt; that's the victory, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; And if you ever had a fiery trial where we have had a situation in our lives where it's the trial of our faith, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I don't know how many people here this morning, I want to say it with by way of an uplift hand, but don't do it because some people might feel uncomfortable with it. I'll do it. I've had a challenge of my faith where I wonder is this message of the hour anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where the devil comes around in your darkest hours and says to you, "You fool, &gt;&gt; look what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Look at the mess you've made of your life. &gt;&gt; Why would you ever continue on with it? Why not just come back? Come back on. Just just come on. &gt;&gt; It's a bunch of nonsense anyway. He didn't even hear your prayer. &gt;&gt; But then when you can shake it off and say, "Lord, I don't understand it. &gt;&gt; I don't understand it. Why do I still have this desire to serve you with all of my heart even though my heart is broken? It feels like my heart has been torn out and put on the ground and and animals have stepped on it. That's how it feels." &gt;&gt; Oh my. But you say in the message of the hour that our feelings have nothing to do with it. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is without sensation. So I can say, "Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't understand it. I can't explain it, but I've got this desire to worship you." &gt;&gt; And then we come to a place where we recognize that's it. &gt;&gt; That is the victory, brothers and sisters. That is God himself manifesting through us &gt;&gt; through our darkest hours. Remember the prophet of God, he tried to kill himself how many times? Yeah, &gt;&gt; that spirit of suicide &gt;&gt; came after the prophet, &gt;&gt; two or three times tried to kill himself, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Maybe just two. &gt;&gt; But regardless, he was a human. &gt;&gt; Wasn't Elijah a man &gt;&gt; subject to like passions? &gt;&gt; Yes, he was. &gt;&gt; So, he would understand the feelings of our infirmities. he would understand what it means to be a human being to be able to preach to people that knew what it meant to witness the power of God not in other people's lives but in their very own life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is this to me? What does it mean to me? &gt;&gt; We're not going to get the right results if we think that we can try and blend anything with this message of the hour. &gt;&gt; It's only by his grace that we are able to believe this message of the hour. And you know sometimes brothers and sisters unfortunately this is the world in which we live in. Sometimes we need to get real weak. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For him to speak to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just for him to speak to us. Maybe better way to say it is for us to hear him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For us to actually close our mouth long enough and open our ears wide enough to listen to that spirit of God. And I say, "Lord, help me. I don't want to actually have to go through those fiery trials, but we all have to. &gt;&gt; Sometimes he allows us to get very, very weak. &gt;&gt; Why is that? &gt;&gt; Because his strength, not our strength, &gt;&gt; his strength &gt;&gt; is made perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In our weakness, &gt;&gt; his strength is made mature &gt;&gt; in our weakness. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the sooner that we can come to him and say, "Lord, I don't know. I don't have the answer. I don't pretend to. I don't want to. I want to die out to myself today and let you run the show. Every single aspect of it, then we can get somewhere." &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians chapter 12. Let's turn there this morning in our last few minutes. 2 Corinthians chapter 12 talking about overcoming and and not overcoming like we said as a a a game as a challenge. We're not talking about that. We're talking about character because that's the only way we're going to overcome is to have a new character. The only thing we're taking with us is our character. It's not our investments. It's not all the good deeds that we've done. It's not the tenure ship that we've had in the message. It's not our knowledge. It's our surrender. &gt;&gt; In 2 Corinthians chapter 12 verse 8, Paul the Apostle, the first church age messenger. This is the pattern for all the other church ages. By the way, for this thing I besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me. And what is this thing? He says that it was a thorn in his flesh. What was that thorn in his flesh? Some people said it was his nose. Some people said it was his eyes. Some people said it was his temper. There's all kinds of different discussions about what it was. I I don't know. I'm not going to go too far with that. But what I want to say is is this. I heard a brother say it at one time. Just remember, brothers and sisters, don't worry about trying to figure out what that thorn was because this flesh is the thorn. &gt;&gt; This flesh is the thorn to our soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. But God allowed it. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, "My grace is sufficient for thee." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to get this through to our young people something bad that we can recognize that his grace is sufficient. &gt;&gt; His grace is sufficient. &gt;&gt; It's not our good works. Amen. &gt;&gt; When we recognize that his grace is sufficient, it gives us the ability to come to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because it's not whether I did this this week or that this week. &gt;&gt; He He did it all. &gt;&gt; He did it all weeks and weeks ago. He He fixed it up so that he could say that his grace is sufficient. And remember, this is the church age messenger to the very first church. Brother Bradom said in the church age book, this is the pattern set out for all of the other church ages. We're not exclusive to it. &gt;&gt; The church age that we live in, my grace is sufficient for thee. &gt;&gt; I just love to put myself there. For my strength is made perfect in weakness. &gt;&gt; So what does Paul say to it? Most gladly, therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities. And that word infirmities means diseases. Therefore will I rather glory in my diseases that the power of Christ may rest upon me. &gt;&gt; His character &gt;&gt; forget about the signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; All of those things will follow. I know we're talking about gifts on Wednesday and we're not talking about celebrating the the mayy signs and wonders and the tremendous things that could happen. We know that that God sent a prophet and he had the signs and wonders in the first and second polls of his ministry. But what do we have now is the opening of the word and it's not a public show. It's an individual affair to be able to say I've got that token. I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost in my life. Doesn't matter what comes my way. I'm going to show that character that he has in me. &gt;&gt; Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me. That power of Christ isn't going to give us signs and wonders. Maybe they'll follow, but more than anything, it will give us the ability to believe this word of God. &gt;&gt; To believe &gt;&gt; infirmities is G769. Febleness. Oh my, I love this. Of mind or body. &gt;&gt; Febleness of mind or body. My by implication, &gt;&gt; malady, &gt;&gt; morality, frailty, disease, infirmity, sickness, weakness. Wow. Paul's saying this, most gladly. Therefore, how many of us will most gladly therefore? Oh my, when we're throwing up because we're so incredibly sick and our our bodies are just convulsing in pain, how many of us will gladly therefore when when we have to bury a loved one? How many of us will gladly therefore when we have to deal with all of these things in our lives? my but that's the example we've been given most gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me. You know in Revelations 3:18 he says I counsel thee to buy of me &gt;&gt; make an investment over here. Forget about the Leo and stuff. &gt;&gt; Forget about all that. And I counsel thee to start making investments over here. &gt;&gt; Investments in the sky, &gt;&gt; investments in your time, investments in your thoughts, investments in your heart, investments of the most precious things that you've got. When you're willing to do that, I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raignment that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear, and anoint thine eyes with Isav that thou mayest see. &gt;&gt; As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be zealous, therefore, and repent. Just die out to yourself daily is all it takes, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. be willing to say, "Be it unto me according to thy will." Every single day I say, "Lord, help me." We get busy. &gt;&gt; It's the life that we live. Sometimes if we sleep in, it's impossible seemingly to spend some time with the Lord. &gt;&gt; We need to capture the time whenever we can. &gt;&gt; Carrying on in the quotes, brother, he says, "This is actually before what we've all read just because I think it's it's incredible. He says, 'Now we can see why there were two vines, one true and one false. Now we can see why Abraham had two sons, one after the flesh that persecuted Isaac and one after the promise. Now we can see how out of the same parents, two boys came forth as twins. One knowing and loving things of God and the other knowing much of the same truth, but not of the same spirit &gt;&gt; and hence persecuted the child that was elect. God did not reprobate for the sake of reprobation. And we know that's isolation. That's to judge to be reprobate for the sec sake of reprobation. He reprobated for the sake of the elect &gt;&gt; to bring separation between them. He reprobated for the sake of the elect. Elect cannot persecute elect. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So just you know when you see persecution within the framework of the Christian church. Elect cannot persecute elect. &gt;&gt; Elect cannot harm elect. It is the reprobates that persecute and destroy the elect. Now, I'm just going to pause there for a second because I think it's really important to point this out. Those reprobates are not people that are raging monsters in this world. &gt;&gt; Just just to make sure we're on the same page with this, these reprobates are religious. &gt;&gt; They are smart. &gt;&gt; They're of the cane line, &gt;&gt; the serpent seed. &gt;&gt; They build their babels. And we know that's a religion, right? The tower. That's a religion. They build their babels. They build their cities. They build their empires. And all the while calling on God, they hate the true seed. &gt;&gt; And they will do all they can, even in the name of the Lord, to destroy God's elect ones. &gt;&gt; I love what he says here. &gt;&gt; This is this is where it's tough to get our heads wrapped around to understand it. He says, "But they are needed." &gt;&gt; They are needed. &gt;&gt; What is the chaff to the wheat? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; No chaff, no wheat. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You have to have the chaff. &gt;&gt; The thing about it though, brothers and sisters, is it's not up to us to determine &gt;&gt; where that chaff is. It's not up to us to determine where the wheat is. &gt;&gt; By their fruit, you shall know them. &gt;&gt; By what comes out of the chaff because the wheat doesn't separate itself from the chaff, by the way. The chaff separates itself from the wheat. &gt;&gt; It pulls away from the wheat. The wheat does not pull away from it. But anyways, what is the chaff to the wheat? No chaff. No wheat. But at the end, what happens to the chaff? It's burned with unquenchable fire. And the wheat, where is it? It's gathered in his garner. &gt;&gt; It is where he is. And we know that in the days of uh Joseph and his brethren, brother Brandham uses that illustration in I believe this part of the church age book. He says that when Joseph revealed himself to his brethren, they were alone in the palace. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. They were alone in the palace. But the interesting part is his bride, Joseph's bride, was actually apart from them. She was separate from them. She was in the palace. Maybe I'm misquing that, but she was taken and put away while he revealed himself to his brethren. And and where is the wheat? It's where he is. That is where the wheat is. So, brothers and sisters, today I just want to say this. If there's only one thing that we could remember from our service today, it's not what we overcome. Because we've got a lot of things to overcome in this world, &gt;&gt; naturally speaking, spiritually speaking, everything in between. There's a lot of things that we need to overcome. The greatest thing that we can ever do is overcome ourselves &gt;&gt; and surrender ourselves to the Lord. If we're willing to do that, then the word will do the work in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word will do that mighty work in our lives. &gt;&gt; Because it's only by the word that we're able to overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we're overcoming on our own, we're not truly overcoming. And remember, if we're getting power by seemingly overcoming on our own without the word of God in our life, it's character without the true power of God, which is satanic. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; I think it's incredible to have a quote like that because that means that there is power without the character of God. &gt;&gt; We don't want to have power over this flesh without God in it, do we? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Some might say, "Well, we've been given the power of free will. We should be able to understand it." The word of God says, "Let this mind that was also in Christ Jesus be in you." So, whose mind is driving us? &gt;&gt; If it's still our mind, then we're not quite there yet. But it's not what we overcome, it's how we overcome it, brothers and sisters. It's by the word of God. It has to be by the word of God. The word of God and only the word of God. Brother Brandham in this in this in this quote out of the Leadyian church age, he says, "Oh elect of God, beware. Study closely. Be careful. Work out your salvation with fear and trembling. Rely upon God and be strong in his might." &gt;&gt; Not in our own might. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we're strong on our own, then we're not actually allowing him to live out through us. &gt;&gt; His strength is made perfect how? &gt;&gt; In our weakness. &gt;&gt; And and that weakness isn't necessarily becoming unstrong in our flesh. We don't lift weights. We don't run. We're not healthy. We don't do that. No, no, no, no. I'm not saying go sit on your couch and just press play all the time. Don't go to work. Don't do anything because you're going to be weak. No. Don't do that. Be strong and in the power of his might. Be up and doing is what the prophet said. Be the best version of you that you can be. Be a normal human being is what the prophet of God said. And I'll say that I think God even said that through the prophet. &gt;&gt; Just be normal. &gt;&gt; Don't be so spiritual that we can't even live in this world. &gt;&gt; But don't be so worldly that you can't even be spiritual. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a balance. And he brings that balance, &gt;&gt; the true baptism of the Holy Ghost in our life. Oh elect of God, beware. Study closely. Be careful. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. Rely upon God and be strong in his might. Your adversary, the devil, is going about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what I think he's doing? He's looking to see who has the token and who doesn't. those people that have the token, he can't touch. &gt;&gt; He can scare them, maybe, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Growl at them, maybe. He might even try and bite them. &gt;&gt; But we know the prophet said that he has no teeth. &gt;&gt; But I would not want to stick my hand in the mouth of a lion with no teeth. I think they've got a pretty strong force of bite. &gt;&gt; I'll call the musicians as we close here today. Rely upon God and be strong in his might. He says, "The adversary, your adversary, the devil, is even now going about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Watch unto prayer and be steadfast." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the end time. He says, "Both the true and false vine are coming into maturity. But before the wheat matures, those ripened tears must be bound for the burning. See, they all are joining the world council of churches. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the binding. Soon the garnering of the wheat will come. But right now, the two spirits are at work in two vines. Come out from among the tears. Start to overcome. I love how he says this. Start to overcome. &gt;&gt; Start to overcome that you may be considered praiseworthy for your Lord &gt;&gt; and fit &gt;&gt; to reign and rule with him. &gt;&gt; We have the ability to be spiritually fit. We're not talking about naturally. Sure, &gt;&gt; we need to live in this world but not be of this world. We want to be fit. We want to eat properly. We want to do all that. But how much more spiritually, brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; to make sure that we have that token, to make sure that we have that life. Because through that word will bring life. &gt;&gt; The impregnation of that word in our hearts, in our souls, will bring that life. And that will give us the ability to overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me as we close today. I love how he says this. Start to overcome. Do it. Go forwards and overcome. start to overcome that you may be considered praiseworthy for your Lord and fit to reign and rule with him. Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, this morning, we thank you for your word. &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for overcoming power in the age in which we live. Father, if there's anybody of us here today, Lord Jesus, that hasn't been overcoming, I pray that you would just help us, Lord, to recognize that we've been encouraged to overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to be fruitful, to be faithful unto you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Father, if there's things in our life that we need to change, that we need to adjust, Father, we pray that you would bring on the natural circumstances to allow us to do it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, that we would be found fit, that we would be found ready for you, that we would be truly overcoming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we love you and we thank you and we Lord just want to commit each life into your hands as we go our separate ways today. Father, we pray that you would be with those who are traveling, Lord. Those who are shoulders to the wheel, bringing the word, Father, to Lethbridge today. &gt;&gt; We pray that you would bless them for their efforts, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We pray that you would, Lord, multiply the harvest in Lethbridge, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we know that you're more than able. We pray that Lord Jesus as we go forwards this week that you would just be conscious in our lives. That we would have a God consciousness &gt;&gt; everywhere that we go, every situation that we encounter. That we would remember that we're not alone. That you're with us every step of the way. That you know our thoughts, that you know our hearts, &gt;&gt; and Father, that we would bring glory to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just ask now that you would bless each one as we go our separate ways today. Bless the youth meeting this afternoon, Father, and be with those who couldn't be here today, Father, wherever they are, whatever they're doing, Father. Maybe some at work, maybe some at home, maybe some are ill, wherever they are traveling, Father, we pray that you would just keep your hand upon each one of them, Lord. And that at your appointed time, you would bring them back home safe again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we'll be careful to give you all the praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We just love you and we thank you. We just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Christ alone. In Christ alone will I glory. So I could pride myself in battles won. I've been blessed beyond measure and by his strength alone I overcome. [Music] Oh I could stop and count successes like diamonds in my hand. But those trophies could not equal to the grace by which I stand. In Christ the Lord I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the intory. Let it be said of me. My source of strength, my source of hope is Christ alone. Christ alone will I glory. For only by his grace I am redeemed. Only his tender mercies could reach beyond my weakness to my knees. And now I see no greater honor than just [Music] [Applause] my [Music] [Music] Heat my heat. [Music] Yeah. [Music] Christ alone. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Applause] Heat.
