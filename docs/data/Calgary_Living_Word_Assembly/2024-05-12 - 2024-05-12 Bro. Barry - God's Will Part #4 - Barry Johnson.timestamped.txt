[41:08] mention that is uh for Dawn
[41:11] Whitley she's a a woman who has helped
[41:13] us over the years many times with our
[41:17] children as a babysitter and just has
[41:19] become a real good friend of our family
[41:21] and she's found herself in the hospital
[41:23] and the doctors don't know why they've
[41:26] ran all the Tas and they have confirmed
[41:28] she doesn't have cancer she's clear of
[41:30] that but she's lost a lot of blood and
[41:33] she just they don't know where it's gone

[45:52] chapter 45
[46:00] we're going to Lord willing conclude the
[46:04] uh the brief study about Joseph
[46:08] today Genesis chter 45 just the first
[46:14] verse then Joseph could not refrain
[46:17] himself before all them that stood by
[46:20] him and he cried cause every man to go
[46:25] out from me and and there stood no man
[46:27] with him while Joseph made himself known
[46:31] unto his
[46:33] Brethren let's just bow one more time
[46:36] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[46:38] goodness and your mercy to us we thank
[46:40] you for the revelation of your word the

[47:27] and uh yeah as we said Happy Mother's
[47:31] Day
[47:33] um just a couple announcements we've got
[47:35] uh Men's breakfast coming up I believe
[47:37] next weekend that's going to be at our
[47:39] place just a little time of Fellowship
[47:41] around the word for just the brethren we
[47:43] got a communion service coming up on the
[47:45] 26th and we'll be hosting that at 5:30
[47:48] p.m. so we can hopefully get everybody
[47:51] out of here at a at a decent time we
[47:54] have brother Dela at delodon he's going
[47:56] going to be here June the
[47:58] 2nd and uh we have brother Jack Duff
[48:01] here on July the 12th and we're trying
[48:05] to fit brother Cadre Diggs in here he's
[48:07] going to be in Grand Prairie but I don't
[48:10] think it's going to work he wanted to
[48:11] come the weekend
[48:13] after uh the week after July 12th but
[48:16] that's uh already taken with brother
[48:18] Jack Duff so I don't know maybe he can
[48:20] come a little bit later we'll see we may
[48:22] see brother kre Diggs here um in July
[48:27] so uh God bless you this morning Amen in
[48:31] our scripture today we were just uh
[48:34] carrying on with the study
[48:36] in God's Will and understanding that you
[48:40] know even though we have a destination
[48:44] that we're all heading towards that
[48:46] we're pressing towards that that Mark
[48:49] that prize of the High Calling of of God
[48:51] in Christ Jesus that's our desire to to
[48:54] go there to go to heaven to go go to our
[48:57] Eternal destination the only place where
[49:00] there is eternal life we've talked about
[49:01] it in the past there's no eternal hell
[49:04] there is a a time and a space where hell
[49:06] will burn and that's one of the biggest
[49:08] tricks of the devil isn't it today to
[49:10] make people believe that there's no God
[49:12] there's no devil there's no Heaven
[49:13] there's no hell you can just do whatever
[49:15] you want anything goes it's just fine
[49:17] that's the biggest trick of deception of
[49:19] the devil there is a place that is
[49:21] burning with fire with unquenchable fire
[49:25] and there is a place that that is
[49:27] actually the best place that we could
[49:29] ever even imagine we can can't even
[49:31] imagine the place and and one of those
[49:33] two places is going to be our
[49:35] destination but only one of them is an
[49:37] eternal
[49:38] destination because God's life is the
[49:41] only thing that's
[49:42] Eternal but don't think for a second
[49:45] that one day we could just say well
[49:46] maybe I could just eat and drink and be
[49:48] merry for tomorrow I die it doesn't
[49:51] matter whether I serve God or not
[49:52] because it's only going to be a limited
[49:54] amount of time one moment of that time
[49:57] in that suffering will not be worth it
[50:00] not one moment so we want to make sure
[50:03] that we're pressing towards that Mark
[50:04] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[50:06] in Christ Jesus and I believe that's why
[50:08] we've all gathered here today certainly
[50:10] thankful for the will of God in our
[50:12] lives and to know that you know we are
[50:14] going to suffer we we read it that all
[50:17] who live Godly in Christ Jesus will
[50:19] suffer persecution but also make no
[50:21] mistake about it those people who don't
[50:23] actually live Godly in Christ Jesus
[50:25] suffer persec ution the only difference
[50:28] is there's no protection for those
[50:30] people it's a freef fall the devil can
[50:32] do whatever he wants to them but the
[50:35] Sons and Daughters of God they are the
[50:36] ones whose Angels God's angels are
[50:40] encamped about them all those who fear
[50:42] Him you know on 1 Thessalonians chapter
[50:45] 5 I just think uh in the will of God
[50:49] talking about the life of Joseph for
[50:50] those people who weren't here for this
[50:52] study this is part four of uh of what we
[50:55] were talking about Joseph and
[50:56] understanding that God's will is not
[50:58] necessarily exactly just a destination
[51:01] even though it is we know brother bradam
[51:03] teaches taught that every scripture has
[51:05] a compound meaning and Revelation so we
[51:08] can read a scripture today and then God
[51:10] can reveal something to us tomorrow that
[51:13] we didn't see today and it's a wonderful
[51:16] thing because that's what Revelation is
[51:17] all about but you know it just became so
[51:20] clear to me once upon a time God showed
[51:22] me this this this I'll say idea or this
[51:26] this theory that brother bradam brought
[51:28] that God's will is his word and I had
[51:31] talked to my pastor many times about
[51:33] God's will for my life because that's
[51:35] what my dad encouraged me to do when I
[51:37] was young and the Pastor said to me
[51:39] God's will is his word and so it took me
[51:41] a long time to actually catch a
[51:43] revelation from God directly about that
[51:46] and and when I caught that Revelation it
[51:47] wasn't just something that I could just
[51:49] maybe and I don't mean this to sound the
[51:51] wrong way brother dawn but it wasn't
[51:54] just something poetic that came out of
[51:55] the air and I said wow this is a
[51:57] revelation from God it was something
[51:59] that God spoke directly to my heart but
[52:01] then I I heard him say it in my heart
[52:04] you want a scripture for that don't you
[52:07] and the first part of it was take a look
[52:09] at Joseph's life Joseph the one whose
[52:12] brothers persecuted him he was a dreamer
[52:15] we know the story very well he dreamed
[52:17] dreams and he told his brothers about it
[52:19] how my sheep was in the middle and all
[52:22] of your sheep while we were harvesting
[52:24] in the field your sheep bowed down in
[52:26] obedience to my chief and of course all
[52:29] the brothers they were like really this
[52:31] guy the one who's loved by the parents
[52:34] more than anyone we know we talked about
[52:35] the mothers we talked about the
[52:36] handmaids we talked about all the
[52:38] Brethren but they were all part of the
[52:40] same family they had the same father and
[52:42] so the brothers hated him because he was
[52:44] loved more by his daddy than everyone
[52:47] else in the family and so Joseph
[52:49] suffered persecution just for being
[52:51] Joseph he didn't do anything and he was
[52:54] persecuted and uh so anyway way it was
[52:56] just just a wonderful Story the way the
[52:58] Lord has led this and given me the
[53:00] ability to see that you
[53:02] know the important thing to recognize I
[53:05] believe we're going to go to heaven when
[53:08] we're saved we're saved we're going to
[53:09] go to heaven when you believe you're
[53:11] sealed brother bam says it you're you're
[53:13] you're not really saved until you're
[53:14] sealed with the Holy Ghost brothers and
[53:16] sisters sorry to break that to us but
[53:18] that's what the prophet teaches we are
[53:20] not converted until we have the Holy
[53:21] Ghost In Our Lives when we get the Holy
[53:23] Ghost In Our Lives it's not just today
[53:25] and then tomorrow we can trip up and
[53:27] fall we could slip back into our old
[53:29] ways and lose the Holy Ghost in our
[53:30] lives that doesn't happen once you are
[53:32] sealed you're sealed till the day of
[53:34] your Redemption you don't need to fear
[53:36] you don't need to worry you are in your
[53:38] promised land and that is the Holy Ghost
[53:40] that's Christ Jesus himself not some
[53:43] scary ghost that's going to come
[53:44] floating into your life and floating out
[53:46] of your life this is the person of Jesus
[53:48] Christ he is identifiable by the life
[53:51] that's lived and that life that's lived
[53:53] is going to be exactly according to his
[53:55] word it's not going to be a spin on it
[53:57] someone else's interpretation it'll be
[53:59] exactly according to the word of God
[54:01] that was delivered through a Vindicated
[54:03] prophet in our age so there's no mixing
[54:07] it up and saying well I believe this way
[54:08] and and maybe I was taught that way
[54:10] that's that's that's not acceptable
[54:12] we're not going to be able to go and
[54:13] stand before God and say well that was
[54:14] what I was taught but did you hear the
[54:16] voice of the Vindicated prophet and if
[54:18] you did hear the voice of the Vindicated
[54:20] Prophet then did you choose to accept it
[54:22] entirely or maybe just reject portion of
[54:25] it we know that Eve she heard the voice
[54:28] of her husband and she chose to reject
[54:31] just one word and what did that do that
[54:33] caused the fall of mankind we know that
[54:36] I don't want to go too far with that but
[54:37] talking about the will of God and Joseph
[54:39] and and how I got to this conclusion how
[54:42] the Lord showed me this every single
[54:44] step of the way in Joseph's life he did
[54:46] not get angry with God he did not stop
[54:49] serving God because of the circumstances
[54:52] and you know if anybody had reason to
[54:54] get upset and maybe take his his things
[54:57] and go
[54:58] home Joseph did Where's
[55:02] God the brothers hate me just for being
[55:04] me even when he explained the second
[55:07] dream to his parents and brothers even
[55:09] his dad said you need to stop doing that
[55:12] you're actually going to say that Mom
[55:14] and I are going to Bow Down and Worship
[55:16] You are you kidding but we know the word
[55:18] of God says his dad took note of that
[55:20] and then his brothers hated him even
[55:22] more because of
[55:24] it it's interesting how God works works
[55:27] and you know he's in control of every
[55:29] single thing there's not one thing
[55:31] that's out of his control there's not
[55:32] one thing that's happening that's just
[55:34] temporarily out of his control
[55:36] everything is working towards God's will
[55:39] amen the footsteps of the righteous are
[55:41] what order of the Lord there's nobody
[55:45] acting in this
[55:47] world without God allowing it but you
[55:51] know I just couldn't help but think
[55:52] today I'm I'm going to go on a little
[55:54] bit of a rabbit hole and I think it's
[55:55] good sometimes what came to my heart
[55:58] actually was it's the Honeypot we're
[56:00] going to get into something here and
[56:01] it's just so good and you know the will
[56:03] of God whatever God's will is for our
[56:05] lives brothers and sisters it's not
[56:07] necessarily just the destination I've
[56:08] been saying this over and over again
[56:10] it's it's actually the journey
[56:14] amen God bless you Sister Rebecca it's
[56:16] good to see your face again she's been
[56:19] in Nigeria for a long
[56:21] time it's wonderful to realize that we
[56:24] can make the journey good or bad and we
[56:28] can make the journey good or bad not
[56:30] just for us but for others and what do
[56:34] we want to do do we want to make the
[56:36] journey bad for others sometimes we want
[56:38] to do that we want other people to live
[56:40] in our suffering we know we've heard the
[56:42] saying many times misery loves company
[56:44] and doesn't it doesn't it you know I'm
[56:48] saying this because I lived it I lived
[56:50] it for my life for a while for many
[56:52] years in my life I complained about my
[56:53] parents my parents weren't the way that
[56:55] I thought they should be my mother
[56:57] wasn't the way that I thought she should
[56:58] be my daddy wasn't the way that I
[57:00] thought he should be but you know what I
[57:02] came to the place one time where I was
[57:04] no longer looking at them the way I
[57:06] thought they should be they are who they
[57:08] are but now what am I going to do about
[57:10] it am I going to go and tell everybody
[57:13] what I think they should be some people
[57:16] live their whole lives doing that
[57:17] expecting other people to be different
[57:19] than they are and then getting angry at
[57:22] them when they don't become who they
[57:23] think they should be what way is that to
[57:26] to live why not just accept people for
[57:29] who they are and say God bless
[57:31] you because I know that God is working
[57:34] out his perfect will in your life just
[57:37] like he's working it out in
[57:39] mine but you know what I want to talk
[57:41] about today was the the honey pot so to
[57:43] speak and I don't mean that in a
[57:45] derogatory way I mean it like a barrel a
[57:47] bucket of honey where brother bradam
[57:48] talks about the the Bears in the tent
[57:51] and how they got into the honey tells it
[57:53] one time with honey and he tells it
[57:54] another time with molasses call it
[57:56] whatever your favorite bucket is that's
[57:58] what I want to talk about today and the
[58:00] will of God and how in everything 1
[58:02] Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 18 says in
[58:06] everything give
[58:08] thanks in everything give thanks not
[58:13] only sometimes not only most times not
[58:16] when I feel good or or when I'm on the
[58:18] Mountaintop experience not when I get a
[58:21] big bonus paycheck and not when uh maybe
[58:24] everything's going good in my life life
[58:26] but when I'm down in the pit because my
[58:28] brothers hate me for no reason when they
[58:31] take me and sell me into slavery I'm
[58:34] betrayed give
[58:36] thanks give thanks why for this is the
[58:40] will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[58:44] you
[58:46] amen so for me I had to go and make that
[58:48] leap I had to change my life and
[58:50] recognize you know what these people are
[58:52] who they are why would I get mad because
[58:54] they're they're they're not who I think
[58:56] should be that's foolish what I need to
[58:59] do is get on with living in my own life
[59:02] and make the best of it because that's
[59:04] what I've been given and you know that
[59:06] was even before I got saved but I know
[59:08] that was God working in my heart giving
[59:10] me the ability to take another step up
[59:13] the stairs towards him and that's what
[59:15] we're doing we're on a journey are we
[59:16] going to mope our way to
[59:19] heaven that's not going to happen it's a
[59:22] wonderful thing amen you know uh just
[59:26] talking about all of this I'm going to
[59:27] read a quotee out of the the the mark of
[59:29] the beast 1956 brother bradam in uh
[59:32] paragraph 43 he says was Christ in
[59:35] Joseph why he portrayed portrayed Christ
[59:38] just perfectly born loved of his father
[59:42] hated of his brother sold for
[59:44] practically 30 pieces of silver put in a
[59:47] ditch supposingly to be dead taken up
[59:51] sitting on the right hand of pharaoh the
[59:52] greatest nation in the world when he
[59:55] went forth
[59:56] they bowed the knee Joseph is
[1:00:00] approaching perfect type of
[1:00:02] Christ how his Brethren was made known
[1:00:06] to him how they wept and said this is
[1:00:09] our sin and how that was portrayed
[1:00:12] letter by letter of
[1:00:15] Christ there came a
[1:00:17] time and there's coming a time where the
[1:00:20] Brethren will say how how H how did you
[1:00:23] get those wounds that are in your hand
[1:00:26] and what's going to happen he's going to
[1:00:28] say I got them in the house of my the
[1:00:30] people who I thought were my friends my
[1:00:32] brethren those tribes of Israel those
[1:00:35] ones but we know remember we actually
[1:00:38] looked at the genealogy and they weren't
[1:00:40] all loved they were just all there I'll
[1:00:45] just say it that way there was only one
[1:00:47] that was loved and that was
[1:00:50] Rachel and I think it's just a beautiful
[1:00:52] thing we know though the the Paradox is
[1:00:56] is that the tribe of Judah which is the
[1:00:59] lineage of Christ comes through Leah how
[1:01:02] do you explain that it's incredible but
[1:01:04] it's true amen you would think it would
[1:01:07] be coming through Rachel but not
[1:01:10] so but you know in uh we'll just do a
[1:01:13] quick little recap sort of as we go and
[1:01:15] then uh then we'll get into it and
[1:01:17] really what I want to what I got into
[1:01:19] myself this is what I thought was so
[1:01:20] sweet was you know give thanks brothers
[1:01:22] and sisters give thanks amen give thanks
[1:01:25] you want to change a circumstance in
[1:01:27] your life give thanks when you're going
[1:01:29] to have a meal give thanks but when you
[1:01:32] get up in the morning give thanks when
[1:01:34] you get to go to church give thanks when
[1:01:36] you get to go to work give thanks when
[1:01:39] you get to pay your bills give thanks
[1:01:42] God is actually providing for
[1:01:45] us in chapter 39 of Genesis you know
[1:01:50] talking about Joseph he was brought down
[1:01:52] into Egypt he was already sold betrayed
[1:01:56] by his brothers he was brought down into
[1:01:57] Egypt and and we know that
[1:02:01] he he was
[1:02:03] faced with being loved above all of his
[1:02:06] Brethren and and with his dreams but he
[1:02:08] was taken down into Egypt because of it
[1:02:09] they couldn't stand him they hated him
[1:02:12] for it but we know in verse two of
[1:02:14] chapter 39 it says and the Lord was with
[1:02:19] Joseph and he was a prosperous
[1:02:22] man and he was in the house of his
[1:02:24] master the Egyptian and the ma his
[1:02:27] master saw that the Lord was with him
[1:02:30] and you know as I was going through this
[1:02:31] study I just want to encourage us I'm
[1:02:33] going to try and go quickly here but I
[1:02:34] just want to hit some high points here
[1:02:36] how many people in the world how many of
[1:02:38] our bosses can see that the Lord Is With
[1:02:40] Us brothers and sisters our masters our
[1:02:42] teachers our parents our husbands our
[1:02:44] wives how many people the neighbors can
[1:02:47] see that the Lord is with us and you
[1:02:50] know what happens Joseph he found Grace
[1:02:53] in his sight and what did he do he s
[1:02:55] served him he didn't regret going to to
[1:02:59] to be there with him God was with him
[1:03:01] and he knew it he served
[1:03:04] him you know in uh I just think it's
[1:03:09] beautiful thing in uh in uh
[1:03:14] sorry I just got a little a little uh
[1:03:18] turned around in Genesis Chapter 30 just
[1:03:23] going to read Genesis Chapter 30 verse
[1:03:25] 22
[1:03:27] I might have got a little bit ahead of
[1:03:28] myself forgive
[1:03:31] me Genesis 30 verse 2
[1:03:38] 22 to
[1:03:42] 25 talking about his mom Joseph's mom
[1:03:45] and God remembered Rachel and God
[1:03:47] hearkened to her and opened her womb and
[1:03:49] she conceived and bear a son and said
[1:03:51] God hath taken away my reproach
[1:03:56] and she called his name Joseph and said
[1:03:58] the Lord shall add to me another son and
[1:04:00] it came to pass When Rachel had born
[1:04:03] Joseph that Jacob said unto laan send me
[1:04:06] away that I might go into my own place
[1:04:09] and into my own country and we know the
[1:04:12] story from there how all of the events
[1:04:16] were orchestrated to bring this to pass
[1:04:20] God was with them all of the way even
[1:04:23] though he was he was deceived into to
[1:04:25] take in Leah as a wife and all of that
[1:04:28] we we know about that I did jump ahead
[1:04:30] and I
[1:04:31] apologize but you know Joseph was 17
[1:04:34] years
[1:04:35] old when uh when his story really
[1:04:39] began we talked about all of that I
[1:04:42] apologize but uh he was taught by his
[1:04:46] parents this is what I wanted to get
[1:04:47] into and
[1:04:49] uh I just think it's so beautiful
[1:04:52] because we need to teach our children
[1:04:53] this to give thanks yes we need to
[1:04:57] understand that all of our Lives all of
[1:05:00] our footsteps are ordered of the Lord
[1:05:02] and that is the will of
[1:05:05] God it's not just happen chance it's not
[1:05:08] just accidental you know it's just
[1:05:11] wonderful isn't it can you think about
[1:05:13] how Joseph must have felt we're going to
[1:05:15] get into this I'm jumping ahead but how
[1:05:17] did Joseph feel when he knew that his
[1:05:19] Brethren were standing before him
[1:05:22] brother brandham says it in one of the
[1:05:23] quotes I don't even know if I have it
[1:05:25] today but he said that Joseph didn't
[1:05:27] even know what he was doing he was just
[1:05:30] being Joseph he was just living his life
[1:05:33] and found himself ascending to the right
[1:05:36] hand of pharaoh to the place where we
[1:05:39] read the quote this morning where
[1:05:40] nothing happened unless they bowed the
[1:05:42] knee to Joseph when he came by what a
[1:05:45] tremendous thing that
[1:05:47] is but talking about our our our life's
[1:05:50] journey and and recognizing that we need
[1:05:53] to trust in the Lord I just looked it up
[1:05:55] and there's a a few scriptures I wanted
[1:05:56] to bring in Psalms chapter 4 you don't
[1:05:58] have to turn there I'll try and go
[1:06:00] through them quickly here because of
[1:06:01] time sake um Psalms
[1:06:05] 4:5 offer sacrifices of righteousness
[1:06:09] and put your trust in the
[1:06:12] Lord in Psalms
[1:06:14] 31 I have hated them that regard lying
[1:06:19] vanities but I trust in the
[1:06:22] Lord Psalms 37 Trust trust in the Lord
[1:06:26] and do good so shalt thou dwell in the
[1:06:32] land and verely thou shalt be
[1:06:36] fed now brothers and sisters we're not
[1:06:38] talking about moving to a a place that's
[1:06:41] really wealthy and going to a land
[1:06:43] that's going to be flowing with milk and
[1:06:45] honey because that's already happened
[1:06:47] naturally we're talking spiritually as
[1:06:49] we read these verses we're going to go
[1:06:51] to a land and we shall be fed and and
[1:06:55] that is in the Holy Ghost that's our
[1:06:58] promised land today that's what brother
[1:06:59] Bram taught is to get the Holy Ghost in
[1:07:01] our lives and then we will be fed when
[1:07:03] we go to church you know brother bradam
[1:07:05] said it if you can't go to church
[1:07:07] somewhere then go to church somewhere
[1:07:08] else and even if there isn't the church
[1:07:11] that you believe go to church right amen
[1:07:14] go to church absolutely because God will
[1:07:17] feed you there yes amen he will take
[1:07:20] that Minister that doesn't preach a
[1:07:22] certain way and he'll get him to bring
[1:07:24] the word of God enough have to feed you
[1:07:26] that's right trust in the Lord and do
[1:07:29] good so shalt thou dwell in the land
[1:07:31] dwell in the Holy Ghost and verily Thou
[1:07:34] shalt be fed he will speak to you you'll
[1:07:36] get Revelation in your life you'll be
[1:07:38] able to teach your children Psalms 40:3
[1:07:41] and he hath put a new song in my mouth
[1:07:45] even praise unto our God I love this
[1:07:49] many shall see it and fear and shall
[1:07:52] trust in the Lords
[1:07:56] 73:28 but it is good for me to draw near
[1:07:59] to God I have put my trust in the Lord
[1:08:03] God that I may declare all thy Works
[1:08:07] Psalms
[1:08:08] 11510 oh House of Aaron trust in the
[1:08:11] Lord he is their help and their Shield
[1:08:15] Psalms
[1:08:17] 1151 ye that fear the Lord trust in the
[1:08:21] Lord he is their help and their Shield
[1:08:24] Psalms
[1:08:25] 188 it's better to trust in the Lord
[1:08:29] than to put confidence in man and you
[1:08:32] know you see that you see it don't put
[1:08:35] confidence in a preacher don't put
[1:08:38] confidence in a man don't put confidence
[1:08:40] in a pastor even though you have to put
[1:08:42] confidence in
[1:08:43] Christ say Lord feed me if you're not
[1:08:46] being fed pray earnestly that God will
[1:08:48] feed you and he will it's better to
[1:08:52] trust in the Lord than to put TR
[1:08:54] confidence in a man Psalms 1189 it's
[1:08:57] better to trust in the Lord than to put
[1:08:59] confidence in
[1:09:01] princes don't trust in prime
[1:09:04] minister don't trust in president don't
[1:09:07] trust in Kings of lands don't trust in
[1:09:10] people trust in God Amen Psalms
[1:09:14] 125 I thought this was really good a
[1:09:16] song of degrees how many knows what that
[1:09:19] means song of
[1:09:21] degrees they that trust in the Lord
[1:09:24] shall be as mount Zion which cannot be
[1:09:27] removed but abideth forever the word
[1:09:31] Zion Mount Zion is actually the Lord
[1:09:34] actually the bride and the Lord as one
[1:09:38] that's Mount Zion that's the New
[1:09:39] Jerusalem City Mount Zion but you know
[1:09:42] degrees is H
[1:09:45] 4609 ma Mal I think is the pronunciation
[1:09:49] it's the
[1:09:51] feminine that is the act literally a
[1:09:54] journey to a high
[1:09:56] place isn't that what happens when we
[1:09:58] sing a song of degrees a song of worship
[1:10:03] it takes us to a higher place doesn't it
[1:10:07] it takes us closer to him it draws him
[1:10:10] closer to us we know his word says that
[1:10:12] draw nigh unto me and I'll draw nigh
[1:10:14] unto you if we're willing to do that
[1:10:17] with the fruit of our lips the sacrifice
[1:10:19] of praise then you know he'll change the
[1:10:22] order of the service for us amen but if
[1:10:25] but if we come to church and you know
[1:10:26] what those Devils make no mistake about
[1:10:28] it the Devils come to church and they'll
[1:10:30] start putting weights on your hands on
[1:10:32] your arms on your lips on your spirit
[1:10:35] they'll try and make you think about
[1:10:36] work they'll try and make you think
[1:10:37] about all the problems in life all the
[1:10:40] issues and situations they'll make your
[1:10:42] shoulders sore so you can't raise your
[1:10:44] hands maybe you can just go this far but
[1:10:46] you know what happens when it's sore
[1:10:48] lean into it lean into the pain brothers
[1:10:50] and sisters be a warrior for Christ and
[1:10:53] lean into the pain and give him the
[1:10:55] glory because he said that if you won't
[1:10:58] cry out the rocks will immediately cry
[1:11:00] out he's not going to say because of the
[1:11:02] song leader because of the music because
[1:11:05] of the temperature whatever the
[1:11:06] circumstance or situation he's not going
[1:11:09] to say that he's going to say did you
[1:11:10] worship or
[1:11:11] not and you know when we have worship
[1:11:14] then he speaks to us it's a
[1:11:17] feminine elevation that is the act
[1:11:20] literally a journey to a higher Place
[1:11:23] figuratively a thought arising or
[1:11:26] concretely the condition literally a
[1:11:30] step or grade Mark I think that's
[1:11:32] beautiful just take a step of Faith
[1:11:34] brothers and sisters try and worship
[1:11:36] maybe like you never have before and see
[1:11:38] if he won't pour out a blessing that you
[1:11:40] can't
[1:11:44] contain a step or grade Mark
[1:11:46] figuratively or
[1:11:49] superiority of
[1:11:51] station superiority of station you can
[1:11:55] just go to a place brothers and sisters
[1:11:57] mentally where you don't have to worry
[1:11:58] about this life and you know we can see
[1:12:00] the whole world is tapping into this
[1:12:02] stuff let's do
[1:12:04] yoga yeah let's do yoga why do people do
[1:12:08] yoga some people say it's so they can
[1:12:10] stretch but you know why people do yoga
[1:12:13] is because it is a worship it's a
[1:12:16] worship but it's not a worship unto
[1:12:18] God and what happens if you've ever done
[1:12:21] it I'm talking from experience I got
[1:12:23] I'll tell you straight I got challenged
[1:12:25] I talked to a girl she was my my
[1:12:27] friend's sister and she was doing yoga
[1:12:30] and I was like Yoga Yoga go for a
[1:12:34] workout man go do something useful with
[1:12:36] your life and she was like oh yeah I
[1:12:38] dare you to come and try it so I was
[1:12:41] like hard could it be
[1:12:44] okay so I went to the yoga studio and I
[1:12:48] did
[1:12:49] yoga that's all I can say I don't know
[1:12:53] but you know what I tried it I tried it
[1:12:57] and all it is is a bunch of stretches
[1:12:58] and Maneuvers and different things as
[1:13:01] you go and and they say do this and you
[1:13:03] do this pose and then you do that pose
[1:13:05] and you do all these different things
[1:13:07] but you know some of it is actually
[1:13:08] worship there's there's a couple
[1:13:10] different I'm not going to preach yoga
[1:13:11] don't get me wrong what I want to say is
[1:13:14] a couple minutes into it I was Dripping
[1:13:16] sweat I was profusely sweating a couple
[1:13:18] minut minutes into it I was trying it
[1:13:20] right but what happened was because I
[1:13:22] did that physical exertion in my body
[1:13:25] when the end of it came they have you
[1:13:27] get
[1:13:28] still they have you rest and it gets
[1:13:32] quiet just like
[1:13:34] this and all you hear is nothing just
[1:13:37] the sound of Life out there with a room
[1:13:39] full of people and what happens is you
[1:13:42] actually are meditating there's
[1:13:44] something spiritual going on and I
[1:13:45] remember thinking that and and when it
[1:13:47] was over I heard I remember hearing the
[1:13:49] little bell Ding and that it was all
[1:13:52] over and then everybody sort of wakes up
[1:13:53] and comes to and you roll your mats and
[1:13:55] you go home you know what there's people
[1:13:58] trying to make literally take a step or
[1:14:00] grade Mark figuratively to a superiority
[1:14:04] of station to another place
[1:14:07] Transcendental Meditation I think it's
[1:14:09] called but you know what brothers and
[1:14:10] sister we don't have to do that we know
[1:14:12] the Living God we can raise our voice in
[1:14:15] praise and worship unto him and he will
[1:14:18] pour out a blessing that we can't even
[1:14:21] contain a literal step or grade mark
[1:14:25] figuratively a a superiority of station
[1:14:28] specifically in a climactic progression
[1:14:31] in certain Psalms things that come up
[1:14:34] high degree deal go up St step story and
[1:14:39] you know when I was reading this and
[1:14:40] studying I just couldn't help but think
[1:14:42] about that that that brother brother
[1:14:44] meno uncle brother meno I'll call him
[1:14:48] and how he told the story about seeing
[1:14:50] his sister the dream about how he was
[1:14:53] talking to his sister and he was just
[1:14:55] taken steps that day and every time he
[1:14:57] took a step he would just go higher and
[1:14:59] higher and higher in the in the air and
[1:15:02] I believe he said this felt like the
[1:15:03] Rapture was actually taking place but he
[1:15:06] was able to experience it it just made
[1:15:07] me think about that testimony that he
[1:15:09] told us here just a wonderful thing
[1:15:12] Proverbs 3:5 trust in the Lord with all
[1:15:15] thine heart not just a part of it not
[1:15:18] just on Sundays not just on Wednesdays
[1:15:21] not just maybe when I feel like it but
[1:15:23] all the time in all thy ways trust in
[1:15:25] the Lord with all your heart and lean
[1:15:28] not unto your own understanding but if
[1:15:30] you try and lean unto your own
[1:15:32] understanding while you're trusting in
[1:15:33] the Lord are you trusting in the
[1:15:35] Lord brothers and sisters it's a serious
[1:15:38] thing many times even in a church we'll
[1:15:40] actually be looking for a spiritual
[1:15:42] answer through a natural solution oh
[1:15:45] that's not the man that I wanted to see
[1:15:46] God put into position you know what if
[1:15:49] the voice of the Holy Ghost is spoken
[1:15:51] and a man gets positioned is that not
[1:15:53] God
[1:15:56] trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[1:15:58] and lean not unto thine own
[1:16:01] understanding how can how do you think
[1:16:03] Joseph must have felt was he thinking
[1:16:06] about this verse because it wasn't just
[1:16:08] David's inspiration that wrote this
[1:16:10] verse was it I I was thinking while he
[1:16:12] was in the in the myy clay while he was
[1:16:14] in the bottom of that pit he must have
[1:16:16] been having some of these thoughts
[1:16:17] himself now maybe it's a stretch brother
[1:16:19] Barry you're going a bit far you're
[1:16:21] taking spiritual Liberty scriptural
[1:16:23] Liberty Maybe
[1:16:25] but I'll say this trust in the Lord with
[1:16:28] all thine heart and lean not unto thine
[1:16:30] own understanding and you know brothers
[1:16:32] and sisters in all thy
[1:16:34] ways all thy ways acknowledge Him and
[1:16:38] then
[1:16:39] what whose will you're going to be
[1:16:43] in you're not going to be in his
[1:16:45] permissive will brothers and sisters it
[1:16:47] doesn't matter where you're at and
[1:16:49] remember when we worry about oh perfect
[1:16:51] will permissive will even if we get
[1:16:53] ourselves out of step with him and we go
[1:16:55] and use our own understanding that's
[1:16:57] going to put you directly in your per in
[1:16:59] his permissive will use our own
[1:17:01] understanding brothers and sisters we
[1:17:02] can say we trust in God all that we want
[1:17:05] to but as soon as we actually don't use
[1:17:08] his leadership in our lives if we're not
[1:17:11] acknowledging him all the way he's not
[1:17:13] going to direct our path he'll let us
[1:17:15] stray a little bit and get into the
[1:17:16] rambles get some prickles in our lives
[1:17:19] get some problems and then we'll turn
[1:17:21] right back to him and say Lord please
[1:17:23] help please help
[1:17:25] but trust in the Lord with all thine
[1:17:27] heart lean not unto thine own
[1:17:28] understanding and you know what when
[1:17:29] you're all your ways are acknowledging
[1:17:32] him he will direct your paths he loves
[1:17:35] to take his permissive will and turn it
[1:17:38] into his perfect will his perfect will I
[1:17:43] personally think that his permissive
[1:17:45] will is part of his perfect
[1:17:47] will because he leads us if we're Sons
[1:17:51] and Daughters of God he leads us and I
[1:17:53] think it's not even really
[1:17:55] Fair we I talk to my dad about this all
[1:17:58] the time and some people might think I'm
[1:17:59] crazy because I was raised in a
[1:18:02] Pentecostal church when I was a kid I
[1:18:04] was dedicated unto the Lord
[1:18:07] period that's all and when I talked to
[1:18:10] my dad about how I strayed into the
[1:18:12] brambles I got out into different things
[1:18:14] and problems and issues in my life and
[1:18:16] completely left God my dad says every
[1:18:18] single time but God never left you but
[1:18:21] God never left you you were never as far
[1:18:24] away as you thought you were and I have
[1:18:27] to say Amen thanks Dad I mean oh what a
[1:18:31] tremendous thing it is Proverbs 28:25 he
[1:18:34] that is of a proud heart stirreth up
[1:18:40] Strife the
[1:18:42] legalists he that is of a proud heart
[1:18:44] stirreth up oh yeah I've heard it all I
[1:18:47] know it yeah there's nothing you can
[1:18:49] tell me that I haven't heard that's
[1:18:51] fine we're not talking about someone
[1:18:53] that's proud that dresses nicely or has
[1:18:56] a nice car or maybe that no no no no no
[1:18:58] this is all about who we are in our
[1:19:01] heart I've never sinned I've never gone
[1:19:03] out into the world I'm perfect are you
[1:19:07] do people know that you serve a living
[1:19:10] God do you say that I'm better because
[1:19:13] I've never gone and sinned in my life
[1:19:17] remember guilty of the least is guilty
[1:19:18] of the
[1:19:19] whole you haven't gone out and murdered
[1:19:21] someone doesn't matter you told a lie
[1:19:24] you're just as is
[1:19:26] guilty even if you haven't told a lie
[1:19:29] you're born in sin you're shaped in
[1:19:31] iniquity you come into this world
[1:19:32] speaking light nothing you can do about
[1:19:36] it but he that is of a proud heart
[1:19:38] stirreth up Strife but he that putteth
[1:19:42] his trust in the Lord amen shall be made
[1:19:46] fat and now we're not talking about fat
[1:19:48] not like brother Barry we're not talking
[1:19:51] about that we're talking about having
[1:19:53] food in your storehouse so that you can
[1:19:55] actually spiritually feed upon that word
[1:19:58] amen so that you could actually feed
[1:20:00] your children on that word so that you
[1:20:03] can actually look after your
[1:20:06] people he that is of a proud heart
[1:20:08] stirreth up Strife but he that putteth
[1:20:10] his trust in the Lord shall be made fat
[1:20:14] Proverbs 29:25 the fear of man bringeth
[1:20:18] a snare but who so putteth his trust in
[1:20:21] the Lord shall be safe amen Hallelujah
[1:20:25] aren't those wonderful scriptures
[1:20:26] brothers and sisters as we walk in our
[1:20:28] lives just put the Lord First Trust in
[1:20:31] the Lord with all thine heart lean not
[1:20:32] unto thine own understanding in all thy
[1:20:34] ways acknowledge Him and He will direct
[1:20:37] your paths when you don't know what way
[1:20:39] to go when you don't know what to say
[1:20:40] when you don't know what to do he will
[1:20:42] tell you what to do just wait upon the
[1:20:45] Lord and He will renew your
[1:20:48] strength you'll Mount up with wings as
[1:20:51] an
[1:20:52] eagle you won't be dancing around in the
[1:20:54] barn yard with the chickens we got a
[1:20:56] potluck at our house today I'm sorry I
[1:20:58] never mentioned it but brothers and
[1:21:00] sisters if you feel inclined I want to
[1:21:02] ask you if you're coming out today just
[1:21:04] take a moment and go over and look at
[1:21:06] the chicken yard if you haven't looked
[1:21:07] at a chicken yard go and look at a
[1:21:09] chicken yard and visualize the story
[1:21:11] that brother bradam tells about how you
[1:21:13] can create an atmosphere anywhere and
[1:21:16] you can take an eagle egg and put it
[1:21:17] under a hen and that hen can hatch out
[1:21:19] the eagle and the eagle can be hopping
[1:21:21] around in the chicken yard and we take a
[1:21:24] bucket in the kitchen and we put it
[1:21:25] under the sink maybe it's too much
[1:21:27] information I'm going to get it from my
[1:21:29] wife but we put all the slot The
[1:21:31] Leftovers in there the stuff that the
[1:21:33] chickens can eat who cares if it's a
[1:21:34] little moldy and a little bit whatever
[1:21:36] it's chickens and we go out to see the
[1:21:38] chickens and we just dump the bucket and
[1:21:41] it goes in all the manure and take a
[1:21:43] look some people might not want to walk
[1:21:46] in there but if you want to we'll let
[1:21:47] you hold a
[1:21:49] chicken we've got some chicks there too
[1:21:52] and they're kind of cute until they grow
[1:21:53] up
[1:21:55] and then they get really stinky but you
[1:21:57] know brother Bram talks about that story
[1:21:59] for a reason go and look at this manure
[1:22:01] that's all around they're pecking in
[1:22:02] this manure their food gets sprinkled
[1:22:04] all through the manure and that's where
[1:22:05] they're living we don't have to live our
[1:22:07] lives like that like the rest of the
[1:22:09] world does brothers and sisters we can
[1:22:11] eat Eagle food we can say the master
[1:22:14] will prepare for us a table in the
[1:22:16] presence of our enemies and it will be
[1:22:19] great triple A oh my beef and we're
[1:22:23] going to be able to just feast on that
[1:22:25] we don't have to eat slop from under
[1:22:27] under someone's
[1:22:32] table just makes me think about Joseph
[1:22:34] being tossed in that
[1:22:38] well how many has heard that
[1:22:42] song even when I don't see it you're
[1:22:47] working even when I don't feel it you're
[1:22:51] working you never stop you never stop
[1:22:54] stop
[1:22:55] working even when I don't see it you're
[1:22:58] working even when I don't feel it you're
[1:23:01] working you never stop you never stop
[1:23:04] working I just can't help but think
[1:23:07] Joseph was singing that song in his
[1:23:08] heart because he couldn't see it he was
[1:23:12] in the bottom of a pit it was dark his
[1:23:15] brothers just threw him down there they
[1:23:16] just totally rejected
[1:23:20] him but somehow he
[1:23:22] knew he knew God was with
[1:23:25] he had a relationship with God and why
[1:23:27] did he have a relationship with God
[1:23:29] brothers and sisters because his daddy
[1:23:30] taught him right the word says train
[1:23:32] them up in the way they should go and it
[1:23:34] will not depart from
[1:23:36] them in in uh sorry chapter 43 carrying
[1:23:39] on here Joseph now he sees his brethren
[1:23:42] for the first time just for time sake
[1:23:44] I'm going to try and and go through
[1:23:46] these I've got a quote or two I still
[1:23:48] want to read but in in chapter 43 Joseph
[1:23:51] he sees his brethren for the first time
[1:23:53] and there's a famine in the land and and
[1:23:56] you know brothers and sisters we we can
[1:23:58] look at this land here that we live in
[1:24:00] and we've got plenty and and we've got
[1:24:03] this opportunity we we all know about it
[1:24:05] but some people might not you could go
[1:24:07] downstairs and see the tables just full
[1:24:09] of food and in the fridge there's full
[1:24:11] of food in the freezer it's full of food
[1:24:14] there's lots of food in the land we can
[1:24:16] talk about famine and there's places in
[1:24:17] the world where there's famine but in
[1:24:19] our day and age when we talk about
[1:24:21] famine in the land we're not talking
[1:24:23] about food natural famine brothers and
[1:24:25] sisters there is a famine in the land
[1:24:28] and that famine is for the hearing of
[1:24:31] the word and the word of God people
[1:24:34] don't want to hear it and even the
[1:24:37] people that want to hear it they can go
[1:24:38] to church and they can't hear it
[1:24:42] right but there was a famine in the land
[1:24:45] and that famine caused circumstances to
[1:24:48] take place didn't it it drove them down
[1:24:51] into Egypt even though Joseph was
[1:24:54] already already there they sold him into
[1:24:56] slavery and he got taken down into Egypt
[1:24:59] they didn't know where he was going they
[1:25:00] just said get rid of him and then we
[1:25:01] don't have to deal with this this
[1:25:03] dreamer
[1:25:04] anymore and and here we have God
[1:25:07] orchestrating it what does he say in the
[1:25:08] word just be sure that your sins find
[1:25:10] you out doesn't he he says that so here
[1:25:13] we have now his Brethren coming down and
[1:25:16] seeing this Leader Joseph he's on the
[1:25:19] throne he's the one that's controlling
[1:25:21] everything in the land the famine is
[1:25:23] sore everywhere except for there because
[1:25:27] of
[1:25:28] Joseph chapter
[1:25:30] 44 we know that
[1:25:32] Joseph he he wanted to see his brother
[1:25:36] his kin brother the one who was the
[1:25:39] brother from his mother he wanted to see
[1:25:44] Benjamin and you
[1:25:46] know when he saw him he had to go back
[1:25:50] he demanded that he see him we know the
[1:25:51] story he demanded to the brothers go get
[1:25:53] go get him you say you got another one I
[1:25:54] want to see that one get him and until
[1:25:57] you get him this other one I think it
[1:25:58] was Simeon he's going to stay here he's
[1:26:00] not leaving he's going to prison and and
[1:26:03] when you come back with Benjamin then
[1:26:05] I'll release him that's fine and and we
[1:26:08] know that they were quivering because
[1:26:10] they had to go back and tell Daddy now
[1:26:12] the one that you said can't go he's got
[1:26:13] to come and if he doesn't come then he's
[1:26:15] not even going to see
[1:26:19] us and so they they went they got him
[1:26:23] they brought him back and they showed
[1:26:25] him and he was so happy to see Benjamin
[1:26:27] his brother and we know Joseph wasn't
[1:26:29] willing to let them go that easy was he
[1:26:32] yes he gave them their money back he
[1:26:33] gave them the sacks of wheat the sacks
[1:26:35] of grain on their mules and and sent
[1:26:39] them on their way but he actually got
[1:26:40] his Porter to put the the Goblet the cup
[1:26:43] inside Benjamin's sack and and here we
[1:26:47] have the story now it it's starting to
[1:26:50] pick up a little bit bear with me for a
[1:26:52] second in chapter
[1:26:57] 44 he knew what he was doing he knew
[1:27:00] exactly what what ass was going to be
[1:27:03] Benjamin's and so he put it in there on
[1:27:06] purpose and you know he sent his Porter
[1:27:09] after them he said to him up in the
[1:27:11] morning after he sent them away get
[1:27:13] after them and I want you to go and and
[1:27:15] find out who stole my cup so I'm
[1:27:18] thinking it must have been a maybe
[1:27:19] another one that did it so he really
[1:27:21] believed this happened I don't know we
[1:27:23] don't know the story but his Porter went
[1:27:25] after them and and said why do you
[1:27:28] return evil for good I was good to you
[1:27:31] and then you've done this to me who
[1:27:32] would dare do that and they said hey man
[1:27:35] we're innocent we're perfect we haven't
[1:27:37] done anything wrong all of our sin is
[1:27:40] under the
[1:27:41] blood right we're perfect there's
[1:27:44] nothing wrong whoever did such a thing
[1:27:46] let him be killed kill that man and that
[1:27:49] the rest of us be your
[1:27:51] servants just made me think while I was
[1:27:53] studying this out isn't that exactly
[1:27:55] like the children of
[1:27:56] Israel just give us a a robber and a
[1:27:59] murderer and take this one that claims
[1:28:02] to be the Messiah and just do away with
[1:28:04] him just just get rid of
[1:28:08] him but we have uh we have the brothers
[1:28:11] claiming everything's good in their life
[1:28:13] yeah no problem whoever who who
[1:28:16] whomsoever of thy servants it be found
[1:28:19] both let him die and we also will be my
[1:28:22] Lord's bondmen this is verse 10 and he
[1:28:25] said of 44 and he said now let it be
[1:28:28] according unto your words he with whom
[1:28:31] it's found shall be my servant and ye
[1:28:35] shall be
[1:28:36] blameless fully knowing what's going to
[1:28:39] happen here and they speedily this is
[1:28:42] verse 11 of 44 they speedily took took
[1:28:45] down every man his sack to the ground
[1:28:46] and opened up every man is sack and he
[1:28:49] searched and began at the eldest and
[1:28:51] left at the youngest and the cup was
[1:28:53] found in Benjamin Zach can you imagine
[1:28:56] what happened to their hearts after
[1:28:58] promising to their dad just kill our
[1:29:00] lineage if we don't bring Benjamin back
[1:29:02] don't worry about it Dad we've got this
[1:29:04] all under control now they've got to go
[1:29:06] and tell them the second time remember
[1:29:09] be sure your sins will find you
[1:29:12] out it's just
[1:29:14] incredible then they rent their clothes
[1:29:17] and laid it every man has asked and
[1:29:19] returned to the city they went right
[1:29:21] back in there they had to go and plead
[1:29:23] now for Joseph's life plead now for
[1:29:26] their lives verse 14 and Judah and his
[1:29:28] Brethren came to Joseph's house for he
[1:29:31] was yet there and they fell before him
[1:29:34] on the ground didn't those sheep pay
[1:29:39] obedience unto Joseph right there and
[1:29:43] Joseph said unto them what deed is it
[1:29:46] that ye have done what are you doing
[1:29:47] here what ye not that such a man as I
[1:29:51] can certainly Divine I mean know he
[1:29:54] wasn't divining here he was just simply
[1:29:56] acting out what he wanted to he was
[1:29:58] getting a little bit of Vengeance in not
[1:30:00] in a bad way but he was letting them
[1:30:02] know without actually revealing
[1:30:05] himself and verse 16 and Judas said what
[1:30:08] shall we say unto my Lord what shall we
[1:30:11] speak or how shall we clear ourselves
[1:30:14] God hath found out the iniquity of thy
[1:30:16] servants behold we are my Lord's
[1:30:20] servants both we and he also with whom
[1:30:23] the cup is
[1:30:25] found I think it's just beautiful
[1:30:28] looking at this you know verse 17 and he
[1:30:31] said God forbid that I should do so but
[1:30:33] the man in whose hand the cup was found
[1:30:36] he shall be my servant and as for you
[1:30:39] get up in peace unto your father just
[1:30:42] leave Benjamin here and you guys get
[1:30:44] lost because I know what that's going to
[1:30:46] do so perhaps maybe he was divining what
[1:30:49] would happen in that
[1:30:51] circumstance oh my then Judah came near
[1:30:56] unto him and now for the second time
[1:30:59] interceded for Joseph remember the first
[1:31:02] time the Brethren were like let's kill
[1:31:03] him here comes the dreamer let's just do
[1:31:05] away with him thatat Roder we hate him
[1:31:08] get rid of him we'll just put some blood
[1:31:10] on his coat and send it to Dad and and
[1:31:12] we'll all be better without him but
[1:31:14] Judah came and said no no no no not so
[1:31:16] don't kill him don't kill him we don't
[1:31:18] want his blood on our hands let's just
[1:31:20] sell him into slavery but verse 16 says
[1:31:23] a Jew Judah said what shall we say unto
[1:31:26] my Lord what shall we speak or how shall
[1:31:28] we clear ourselves for God hath found
[1:31:30] out the iniquity of thy servants and I
[1:31:33] can only imagine he was not only
[1:31:36] thinking about that cup but he was
[1:31:38] thinking about his brother because later
[1:31:40] on we know when they're there they
[1:31:43] actually have a conversation in front of
[1:31:45] Joseph and they explain you know God's
[1:31:48] found out about us God is dealing with
[1:31:50] us that's the reason we're going through
[1:31:52] all this because of what we've done to
[1:31:53] our
[1:31:54] brother he leads him that way but Judah
[1:31:57] came near in verse 18 and said unto him
[1:31:59] oh my Lord let thy servant I pray thee
[1:32:02] speak a word in my Lord's ears and let
[1:32:05] not thine anger burn against thy servant
[1:32:08] excuse me for thou art even as
[1:32:12] Pharaoh knowing that unless he said it
[1:32:15] nothing was going to
[1:32:17] happen and it's just a an interesting
[1:32:20] thing to look at this this chapter Jose
[1:32:24] has Benjamin returned to him at first
[1:32:27] they simply said just slay the one that
[1:32:29] did such a thing so so flippantly just
[1:32:32] slay him we're perfect there's nothing
[1:32:33] wrong in our heart there's no iniquity
[1:32:35] found in our hearts just go ahead and
[1:32:37] slay him and then wow now they've
[1:32:39] changed it to pleading for the life of
[1:32:42] Benjamin don't don't let us go back home
[1:32:44] and tell Daddy that Benjamin is not here
[1:32:46] because we already told him that he's
[1:32:48] coming it's not going to be a problem
[1:32:51] and it's just interesting because now
[1:32:54] now the Brethren are back in front of
[1:32:56] Joseph God completely spun the tables
[1:33:00] and now they're pleading with Master
[1:33:02] Joseph it's just beautiful how God does
[1:33:07] it chapter
[1:33:10] 45 where we read the scripture today
[1:33:13] verse one then Joseph could no longer
[1:33:16] refrain himself before all them that
[1:33:19] stood by him and he cried cause every
[1:33:22] man to go up out from me and there stood
[1:33:25] no man with him while Joseph made
[1:33:27] himself known unto his Brethren and wept
[1:33:30] aloud and the Egyptians and the house of
[1:33:33] pharaoh heard and Joseph said unto his
[1:33:35] Brethren I am Joseph does my father yet
[1:33:39] live and his brother Brethren once again
[1:33:42] could not answer him for they were
[1:33:45] troubled at his presence can you imagine
[1:33:47] what that must have felt like the roller
[1:33:50] coaster of emotions that they were on
[1:33:52] and you know I'm not feeling bad for the
[1:33:54] brothers I'm just trying to illustrate
[1:33:56] it it's interesting to think about how
[1:33:58] terrible they must have felt how God
[1:34:00] allowed all of these circumstances to
[1:34:02] play
[1:34:04] out but we know Joseph he goes on to say
[1:34:06] you know what God did send me before you
[1:34:08] to preserve life amen that's the reason
[1:34:11] why you did what you did you had no idea
[1:34:14] why you were doing what you were doing I
[1:34:16] had no idea why I was doing what I was
[1:34:19] doing we were all just acting out the
[1:34:21] roles that God has created us to do
[1:34:24] amen and alls we have to do is make sure
[1:34:27] that we acknowledge Him in all of our
[1:34:28] ways brothers and sisters verse 7 said
[1:34:31] and God sent me before you to preserve
[1:34:33] you a prosperity in the earth and to
[1:34:36] save your lives by a great
[1:34:40] Deliverance so now it was not you that
[1:34:43] sent me hither but God isn't that
[1:34:48] interesting many times in our lives we
[1:34:50] can look at our lives and say that it
[1:34:51] was so and so sending of me it was so
[1:34:55] and so's doing that caused me to act you
[1:34:58] know what it was it was God it was God's
[1:35:01] will actually coming out and being
[1:35:04] performed in our lives and we know
[1:35:07] there's many things that we don't like
[1:35:08] there's prickly things about ourselves
[1:35:10] that we don't like that God doesn't like
[1:35:11] but he knows they're there and he's
[1:35:12] going to get them out of us and how does
[1:35:14] he do it he squeezes us he allows us to
[1:35:17] go through a fire he allows us to go
[1:35:19] through a trial because things have to
[1:35:21] come out of us remember David he was the
[1:35:23] King David was a man after God's Own
[1:35:26] Heart but he had iniquity in his heart
[1:35:28] he was still a murderer wasn't he he was
[1:35:31] still an adulterer wasn't he but God
[1:35:33] took both of those right out of his
[1:35:36] heart and even when the prophet came and
[1:35:38] said to him oh I've got a a situation
[1:35:40] King live forever there's this man he he
[1:35:44] he has great herds and flocks everything
[1:35:46] in the land the Lord has looked after
[1:35:48] him so diligently but yet he saw one man
[1:35:52] across the street and he only only had
[1:35:54] one she lamb and he had to take that
[1:35:57] lamb for himself and we know the story
[1:36:02] and David said oh right away let that
[1:36:04] man die I'm going to judge that man and
[1:36:06] you know what the prophet said to him
[1:36:08] that man is
[1:36:10] you don't ever let ourselves get puffed
[1:36:12] up within ourselves brothers and sisters
[1:36:14] because the moment we do that God's
[1:36:15] going to say that's
[1:36:17] you he allows us to go through pressure
[1:36:20] to show us who's on the inside
[1:36:26] but I just love this verse 45 then
[1:36:27] Joseph could no longer refrain himself
[1:36:30] and cause every man to go out from me
[1:36:32] and you know brothers and sisters that
[1:36:34] time is nearly just upon us we know that
[1:36:37] Israel is back in the
[1:36:39] Homeland and
[1:36:41] Joseph Jesus is just about to reveal
[1:36:44] himself to his
[1:36:46] Brethren some people might be saying
[1:36:48] well first brother Barry there's got to
[1:36:50] be two prophets that go and preach the
[1:36:51] message of the hour to them and true
[1:36:54] that's going to happen first there
[1:36:55] should be a Rapture of the church true
[1:36:57] there should be those things but don't
[1:36:58] look for things to happen brothers and
[1:37:00] sisters because as soon as we start
[1:37:01] looking for natural circumstances to
[1:37:03] decide that we're going to get in the
[1:37:04] boat it's going to be too late because
[1:37:07] man doesn't close the door man doesn't
[1:37:10] call man into the boat it's the
[1:37:12] inspiration of the Holy Ghost and
[1:37:14] outside of the Holy Ghost the real
[1:37:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:37:18] inspiration is wrong we're going to have
[1:37:20] the wrong inspiration so our GPS is
[1:37:22] going to be tied into something wrong
[1:37:24] it's going to give us the wrong
[1:37:25] coordinates and we're going to drive to
[1:37:27] the wrong location thinking we're in the
[1:37:28] right place and we're going to find out
[1:37:31] the Rapture is already gone we're going
[1:37:32] to see the two witnesses in the land of
[1:37:34] Israel and we know that it's going to be
[1:37:36] three and a half years of absolute chaos
[1:37:39] like this world has never seen that is
[1:37:41] so close brothers and sisters any moment
[1:37:43] now you know the word of God says
[1:37:45] there's coming a time where Israel will
[1:37:47] be completely surrounded by the world
[1:37:50] has there ever been a time where it's
[1:37:52] like it is now
[1:37:54] the US is turning on
[1:37:56] them all the countries that were around
[1:37:59] they're calling for a uh what is it a
[1:38:01] court marshal or a issue a warrant for
[1:38:03] the arrest in the international court
[1:38:06] for Benjamin
[1:38:07] Netanyahu I would say the world is
[1:38:09] surrounding Israel right now they've got
[1:38:13] nowhere to go and uh that's why they're
[1:38:16] fighting for their life and they're not
[1:38:17] going to listen to anybody because
[1:38:18] they're going to fight for their life
[1:38:20] because there's 144,000 little Benjamins
[1:38:22] down there right now just waiting for
[1:38:24] messiah to come
[1:38:27] amen but God sent me before you to
[1:38:30] preserve a prosperity in the earth and
[1:38:32] to save your lives by a great
[1:38:35] Deliverance I just can't help but think
[1:38:37] how many people have we seen gone on
[1:38:39] before us brothers and sisters that have
[1:38:41] done things for us in our lives brother
[1:38:43] Bram laid his life down so that he could
[1:38:47] preserve a prosperity in the earth not
[1:38:50] just in Egypt but in the earth amen
[1:38:53] so that we could actually save our lives
[1:38:57] by a great Deliverance because we could
[1:38:59] get the message of the hour we could get
[1:39:01] the direction to get the baptism of the
[1:39:03] Holy
[1:39:04] Ghost because outside of that we're
[1:39:07] going to miss
[1:39:09] it I just can't imagine what that must
[1:39:11] have been like when Joseph revealed
[1:39:13] himself to his Brethren and you know
[1:39:15] that time is very very close where
[1:39:19] Joseph will reveal himself to the
[1:39:21] children of Israel once again and we
[1:39:23] know that that will call out the 144,000
[1:39:25] that there will be a nation saved in a
[1:39:27] day and it's going to be an amazing time
[1:39:30] whether we'll be here or not I don't
[1:39:32] know I'm not going to say one way or the
[1:39:33] other brother bam talks about it one way
[1:39:35] and the other way you know what we're
[1:39:37] not supposed to look at natural times no
[1:39:39] man knows the day or the hour but we can
[1:39:41] certainly see the season and this is the
[1:39:44] season brothers and sisters that fig
[1:39:46] tree has put forth its bud in in in
[1:39:49] chapter
[1:39:51] 45 Joseph could no longer refrain frin
[1:39:55] himself and caused every man to go from
[1:39:58] me this is where brother bradam I
[1:40:00] believe he does lean more to this side
[1:40:03] where when Joseph reveals himself when
[1:40:06] Christ reveals
[1:40:08] himself the bride is going to be in the
[1:40:10] palace brother bradam says it very
[1:40:12] clearly that the bride is in the palace
[1:40:15] but what exactly when that time is I'm
[1:40:18] not going to try and and and go there
[1:40:20] but I do want to say this when he is
[1:40:21] revealing himself to his Brethren to
[1:40:24] those
[1:40:26] 144,000 Benjamins the ones that really
[1:40:29] truly love the Lord he's going to cause
[1:40:32] every man to go for me and that is where
[1:40:34] he's going to cause the Gentile Church
[1:40:36] to be gone the true church will be in
[1:40:39] the palace because she is the bride and
[1:40:42] you know we know the word of God says
[1:40:43] that we need to rejoice and be very glad
[1:40:47] why is that because the marriage of the
[1:40:50] Lamb has come and what not his bride has
[1:40:54] made herself ready his wife ha made
[1:40:57] herself ready and that signals something
[1:41:00] significant brothers and sisters it's no
[1:41:02] longer the wedding ceremony now they
[1:41:05] have consummated the marriage and the
[1:41:07] Twain have become one and that is
[1:41:09] actually happening right now today
[1:41:11] brothers and sisters I know we're living
[1:41:14] in the bride age but there's got to be
[1:41:16] some people getting married to their
[1:41:19] bridegroom and when you're married to
[1:41:20] your bridegroom you become one with your
[1:41:23] bridegroom and your thoughts are his
[1:41:26] thoughts his thoughts are your thoughts
[1:41:28] he can start a sentence and you can
[1:41:31] finish the sentence because you're no
[1:41:33] longer Twain You're
[1:41:37] one then Joseph could no longer refrain
[1:41:41] himself imagine what that's going to
[1:41:44] sound like for Jesus to go back and talk
[1:41:47] to his Brethren and to have that
[1:41:49] spiritual intimacy with them where
[1:41:52] there's no distraction now the bride's
[1:41:54] gone she's in the palace nice and safe
[1:41:57] at the marriage supper of the Lamb oh my
[1:42:00] she's not going to be dealing with life
[1:42:02] anymore he doesn't have to think about
[1:42:03] her for a moment now he's going to turn
[1:42:05] his attention to these little Benjamins
[1:42:07] and while he's dealing with them can you
[1:42:09] imagine how they're going to feel when
[1:42:11] they recognize when that blindness that
[1:42:14] was that blindness was put on their eyes
[1:42:16] so that we could be saved
[1:42:18] today they're going to recognize for
[1:42:21] centuries they have thought that he was
[1:42:24] a charlatan that he was not the Messiah
[1:42:27] but there's going to be a revelation
[1:42:28] just like we've been given about this
[1:42:30] message of the hour about our own
[1:42:32] salvation about the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:42:33] Lives the same Revelation is going to
[1:42:36] strike their hearts oh my I've never
[1:42:39] been to Israel but I have heard I've
[1:42:41] seen video of them worshiping before the
[1:42:44] Wailing Wall some of us have been there
[1:42:46] to Israel and have seen such a thing can
[1:42:49] you imagine what it will be like 144,000
[1:42:53] crying out to God
[1:42:56] oh my I just think that's wonderful in
[1:42:59] chapter 46 Israel journeyed to beers
[1:43:02] Sheba Israel Jacob he decided to go and
[1:43:07] worship in beerseba according to the
[1:43:09] Lord he called him and said come and
[1:43:12] offer
[1:43:13] sacrifices in a place where your dad
[1:43:16] used to do it and so he did he went to
[1:43:18] beerseba to offer the sacrifices and God
[1:43:21] promised to him don't fear it's okay
[1:43:25] your son is down in Egypt he's got a
[1:43:27] good position there don't worry this is
[1:43:29] all under control I've got this you just
[1:43:32] go down there you just take your family
[1:43:34] down there and you're going to multiply
[1:43:35] you're going to become a great nation
[1:43:37] you are going to be just tremendous and
[1:43:40] then we go into uh chapter what was that
[1:43:43] 46 47 even in 46 we have the geneologies
[1:43:47] I'm just trying to move for time sake
[1:43:50] here in uh chapter 47 Joseph
[1:43:53] introduced his family to Pharaoh we know
[1:43:56] that he had sent Pharaoh he told Pharaoh
[1:43:59] about his family after revealing himself
[1:44:01] to his Brethren Pharaoh said just get
[1:44:04] your family bring them down here I want
[1:44:05] to meet him bring them to the Palace
[1:44:07] let's see your family I'd love to meet
[1:44:09] him like to meet your dad how did you
[1:44:11] become who you are we know somebody
[1:44:14] trained you upright in the way you
[1:44:16] should go so Joseph he introduced his
[1:44:18] family to pharaoh and you know I I just
[1:44:22] was thinking about this is struck my
[1:44:23] heart so strongly what's it going to be
[1:44:26] like one day because this maybe it's my
[1:44:27] own scriptural spiritual spin my own
[1:44:32] spiritual uh Liberty if you will but
[1:44:36] what if we as parents get to present our
[1:44:40] families to God we get to take our
[1:44:42] families to pharaoh and say yes this is
[1:44:45] my son this is my son this is my son
[1:44:49] they have all chosen to worship you they
[1:44:51] have all chosen to live listen to the
[1:44:53] teaching that I have gave them what a
[1:44:56] tremendous time that will be we know
[1:44:58] that the prophets get to take their
[1:44:59] people and introduce them don't they but
[1:45:03] here we have the scriptural version
[1:45:05] Joseph took his family and introduced
[1:45:07] them to pharaoh and you know I just
[1:45:10] believe we will in verse 5 and six of uh
[1:45:13] 47 Pharaoh said you know what Joseph
[1:45:17] just make sure your family's looked
[1:45:19] after just whatever they need don't
[1:45:21] worry about it just put it on my tab
[1:45:24] they have an open PO with the king of
[1:45:26] the land can you imagine they want a
[1:45:28] Cadillac Chariot they want the best
[1:45:30] horse they want really fine flour bread
[1:45:33] flour to bake their bread with they want
[1:45:35] the best whatever they want just give it
[1:45:38] to them just make sure they've got it
[1:45:40] Pharaoh said to them make sure you look
[1:45:42] after your family and he didn't say just
[1:45:44] look after them but he said give them
[1:45:46] the
[1:45:47] best can you imagine that that's Joseph
[1:45:51] interceding for us Jesus Christ they the
[1:45:54] family of Christ give them the best the
[1:45:57] father Pharaoh telling Jesus the Holy
[1:46:00] Ghost give them the best they're
[1:46:02] following me they're serving every
[1:46:04] ordinance that I've given them all of
[1:46:06] the Revelation that I've placed in their
[1:46:07] heart they're doing it just give them
[1:46:10] the best don't hold anything back from
[1:46:12] them in the land verse 11 to13 Joseph he
[1:46:15] placed his brethen he took the Holy
[1:46:18] Ghost and positionally placed his
[1:46:20] brethren in the land gave them the best
[1:46:22] power palaces the best houses the best
[1:46:24] everything they desired he nourished his
[1:46:27] father and Brethren with bread now this
[1:46:30] one kind of surprised me because I
[1:46:32] thought you know there is a famine in
[1:46:34] the land and there is grain there
[1:46:35] they've got lots of grain and stuff but
[1:46:37] it says in there that Joseph's family
[1:46:39] was nourished with bread verse 13 but
[1:46:42] there was no bread in all the
[1:46:45] land there was no bread in all the land
[1:46:47] even in Egypt and Canaan says that the
[1:46:51] people fainted because there was no
[1:46:53] bread there was no food but Joseph's
[1:46:55] family was looked after all of his
[1:46:57] Brethren were looked after everything
[1:46:59] was good for them trust in the Lord with
[1:47:02] all your heart brothers and sisters
[1:47:03] don't lean onto your own understanding
[1:47:05] on your journey make sure that you trust
[1:47:08] in the Lord and make sure that you
[1:47:10] worship Him amen yes don't wait for
[1:47:13] someday where I'm going to worship him
[1:47:15] when I get over there you're not going
[1:47:17] to get over there if you're not
[1:47:18] worshiping him now
[1:47:23] chapter 48 and 49 Israel blessing Israel
[1:47:27] was blessing his children Jacob took
[1:47:31] every one of the children just for time
[1:47:32] sake I'm going to blow through this but
[1:47:34] every one of them he pronounced a
[1:47:35] blessing upon them before he died the 12
[1:47:38] patriarch and you know Their Blessings
[1:47:40] weren't that great they weren't that
[1:47:42] encouraging they weren't that exciting
[1:47:44] and that was because of their names that
[1:47:46] was because of the way they acted and if
[1:47:48] you go and you read it you'll see that
[1:47:50] it wasn't really the most exciting thing
[1:47:52] thing but he did he told them I know
[1:47:55] what you did I know what you did and
[1:47:57] this is what's going to happen this is
[1:47:59] how you're going to be this is how your
[1:48:00] children will be this is what you're
[1:48:01] going to encounter but it's the path you
[1:48:04] chose didn't mean they didn't get the
[1:48:06] blessings still in their
[1:48:08] lives and that's the crazy thing you
[1:48:11] know what happens is maybe we'll still
[1:48:13] have a blessing in our life God is that
[1:48:15] merciful he did that with Kings in
[1:48:17] Israel he said you know I I I won't
[1:48:19] judge you it's okay but your children
[1:48:22] and your children's children they're
[1:48:24] going to pay for your
[1:48:26] sins it's a terrible thing we need to
[1:48:29] make sure that we have our own salvation
[1:48:31] worked out with fear and trembling
[1:48:33] because we might still have many
[1:48:35] blessings in our lives but what about
[1:48:36] our children and our children's children
[1:48:38] some might say well the Rapture is going
[1:48:40] to go and we don't have to worry about
[1:48:41] that yeah we do have to worry about that
[1:48:43] we're supposed to Hal our potatoes like
[1:48:45] he's coming A hundred years from now
[1:48:53] but he pronounced a blessing on each one
[1:48:55] of them that wasn't really the greatest
[1:48:56] blessing some might say it was even a
[1:48:58] cursing but it's the way it was for them
[1:49:00] in their lives um it's the way it worked
[1:49:03] out it was the will of God but you know
[1:49:05] we we need to be careful and understand
[1:49:08] that whatsoever we sow that's what we're
[1:49:11] going to reap amen because God will not
[1:49:13] be
[1:49:14] mocked God will not be
[1:49:16] mocked in chapter 50 this is really what
[1:49:19] I wanted to get to to draw a a close of
[1:49:23] of the the story of
[1:49:26] Joseph in chapter
[1:49:28] 50 starting at Verse
[1:49:31] 18 you
[1:49:36] know again his Brethren came this ISS
[1:49:40] after the death of of of daddy he passed
[1:49:44] away and his Brethren were able to see
[1:49:47] all of the exploits of Joseph and to
[1:49:50] recognize and I Can Only Imagine because
[1:49:52] of Verse 18 the way they say this the
[1:49:54] the word says this and his Brethren also
[1:49:57] went and fell down before his
[1:49:59] face and they said behold we be thy
[1:50:05] servants verse 17 says so shall ye say
[1:50:08] unto Joseph forgive I pray thee now the
[1:50:10] trespass of thy Brethren and their sin
[1:50:13] for they did unto thee evil and now we
[1:50:17] pray thee forgive the trespass of the
[1:50:20] Servants of the god of thy
[1:50:23] father and Joseph wept when they spake
[1:50:27] unto him and we know Verse 18 that's
[1:50:29] where they bowed down again their
[1:50:31] sheaves actually paid obedience just
[1:50:33] exactly like he said would happen in the
[1:50:36] dream that God gave him that was a Dream
[1:50:38] from God it was a prophecy from the
[1:50:41] dream but I just I just can't help but
[1:50:43] think that when they did this it was
[1:50:46] because daddy died now perhaps Joseph
[1:50:50] was just being kind to us because Daddy
[1:50:52] was here and he didn't want to upset
[1:50:54] Daddy but they didn't realize that
[1:50:57] Joseph wasn't about that at all Joseph
[1:51:00] was actually a Son of God and Joseph
[1:51:03] truly understood where he was at even
[1:51:06] though on his journey as he encountered
[1:51:09] the pitfalls the slavery the beatings
[1:51:12] the mistreatment we know the story as he
[1:51:15] went along and encountered all of that
[1:51:18] he just still kept the word of God in
[1:51:21] his heart he remembered the teaching of
[1:51:23] his daddy and and God blessed him for it
[1:51:26] amen out of faith in uh in
[1:51:31] 1956 brother Bram said and I said I see
[1:51:34] so much evil on the street when I see
[1:51:35] that evil I look at the cross and I
[1:51:38] think oh God how I love you for saving
[1:51:41] me from such a corruption that's right
[1:51:44] let him let him always be before our
[1:51:50] face now Abraham was called by election
[1:51:53] Abraham is election Isaac is
[1:51:59] justification Jacob is
[1:52:02] Grace and Joseph is perfection am and
[1:52:06] you know brothers and sisters we know we
[1:52:08] read out of Hebrews 6 let us go onto
[1:52:12] Perfection not worrying about the
[1:52:14] traditions of church laying on of hands
[1:52:17] water baptisms and we'll do all of those
[1:52:19] Lord permitting but let's go on to
[1:52:22] perfection
[1:52:23] and the only way we can go on to
[1:52:24] Perfection is through the lives of the
[1:52:27] people before
[1:52:28] us Joseph is perfection he says now in
[1:52:31] the beginning when God called Abraham he
[1:52:34] called him not because he was a good man
[1:52:37] but because God fornew Abraham God knew
[1:52:39] Abraham would do knew what Abraham would
[1:52:42] do he knowed Abraham he said I'll know
[1:52:46] what Abraham will raise his children to
[1:52:48] fear the lord God knowed him God knows
[1:52:53] you I'll say it this way God knows you
[1:52:55] thank you Lord that's the reason we as
[1:52:58] Cong Congressman Upshaw used to say we
[1:53:00] can't make ourselves something that we
[1:53:02] hate that's right no matter how much you
[1:53:06] try to impersonate you can't do it it's
[1:53:09] the Sovereign Grace of God that calls
[1:53:12] you brothers and sisters don't pretend
[1:53:14] don't fake it till you make it just give
[1:53:17] your lives unto God Just Surrender unto
[1:53:19] him see if he's not God ask him if
[1:53:22] you're God be God in my life and see if
[1:53:25] he won't reveal himself to you and
[1:53:28] through you and Abraham was called by
[1:53:31] the grace and by election and when he
[1:53:35] was called when he was was received his
[1:53:39] call he was given the Covenant of God
[1:53:42] not because he was a good man but it was
[1:53:44] given unconditionally to him and every
[1:53:48] single one of us have the very same
[1:53:49] covenant not in a natural sense but in a
[1:53:51] spiritual sense which is even better
[1:53:54] than a natural sense because we are the
[1:53:57] spiritual Seed of Abraham the spiritual
[1:54:00] Royal Seed of Abraham and that Covenant
[1:54:03] isn't a conditional covenant not if you
[1:54:06] do I will I've
[1:54:08] done I sent myself my son my expression
[1:54:12] of God to the Cross to die and pay for
[1:54:15] every single sin on the earth and that's
[1:54:18] it there's nothing that we can do to
[1:54:20] atone for sin we just need to AC except
[1:54:22] that he did
[1:54:24] it but it was given unconditionally to
[1:54:27] him he says now this is going to hurt
[1:54:29] legalist Believers just a little bit now
[1:54:33] I don't mean to pinch but we want to
[1:54:35] know the truth see there's nothing that
[1:54:37] a man can do to save himself you are
[1:54:40] already saved by grace that's right you
[1:54:42] can't stop eating meats you can't stop
[1:54:44] doing this you can't stop there's
[1:54:46] nothing you can
[1:54:48] do and I want to say this brothers and
[1:54:51] sisters We Can't Stop anything in our
[1:54:54] lives Naturally Speaking spiritually
[1:54:56] speaking Naturally Speaking we have
[1:54:58] things in our lives where we would think
[1:55:00] oh my I've tried and tried and tried and
[1:55:02] tried and tried to stop this thing I I
[1:55:04] just can't seem to overcome it you know
[1:55:06] what you never
[1:55:08] will you never will and God allows those
[1:55:11] things to be in our lives to show us
[1:55:13] that we never
[1:55:15] will but by his grace brothers and
[1:55:17] sisters if we're willing to say God be
[1:55:20] Lord in my life that means surrender in
[1:55:22] every single thought every single action
[1:55:24] every single thing that I do you're
[1:55:26] going to have control over every
[1:55:28] decision in my life because you're Lord
[1:55:31] that's different that's where you will
[1:55:32] see God come into your life and you will
[1:55:34] start losing these things that you
[1:55:36] thought you could never overcome and and
[1:55:38] the biggest one is
[1:55:41] ourselves there's nothing a man can do
[1:55:44] to save himself you are already saved by
[1:55:47] grace that's right you can't stop eating
[1:55:49] meat you can't stop doing this you can't
[1:55:51] stop there's nothing nothing you can do
[1:55:55] Christ saves you and that alone and
[1:55:57] that's right you can't even come to him
[1:56:00] I love this unless he chooses you
[1:56:04] first he said you never chose me but I
[1:56:07] chose you and no man can come to me
[1:56:09] except the father draws
[1:56:12] him brothers and sisters if you feel the
[1:56:15] father drawing you don't resist
[1:56:17] them and all that comes I'll give him
[1:56:20] everlasting life and raise him up at the
[1:56:23] last day amen that settles it oh my
[1:56:26] that that would make the Methodist get
[1:56:29] happy think of
[1:56:31] it he'll raise us up at the last day now
[1:56:35] where am I going with this I'm I'm going
[1:56:37] somewhere and I've only got 10 minutes
[1:56:39] thinking about the story of Joseph with
[1:56:41] this he says why it's not we are but
[1:56:44] what Christ is for us Christ become you
[1:56:46] and I that you and I might become him he
[1:56:49] taken our sins that we might take his is
[1:56:52] righteousness isn't that beautiful so
[1:56:55] it's nothing in my arms I bring simply
[1:56:57] to thy cross I cling nothing I could do
[1:57:00] nothing you could do it's the grace of
[1:57:02] God I just think it's so beautiful when
[1:57:05] we recognize the grace of God brothers
[1:57:06] and sisters talking about the story of
[1:57:12] Joseph verse 19 of chapter
[1:57:16] 50 his brothers came and said don't kill
[1:57:18] us now because Daddy's Gone don't do us
[1:57:21] in
[1:57:23] because they still hadn't forgiven
[1:57:24] themselves not recognizing really who
[1:57:27] Joseph was and that really he meant what
[1:57:28] he said and that was because of the
[1:57:30] iniquity in their own Hearts right
[1:57:33] because they were
[1:57:34] skunks and daddy proclaimed that
[1:57:36] blessing upon them yeah you're a skunk
[1:57:38] and this is what's going to happen in
[1:57:39] your life because of your behavior but
[1:57:42] it's God's choice it's his plan but par
[1:57:45] or sorry verse 19 of chapter 50 and
[1:57:48] Joseph said unto them fear not for I am
[1:57:51] in the place am I in the place of
[1:57:54] God verse 20 but as for you ye thought
[1:57:57] evil against me but God meant it unto
[1:58:01] good to bring to pass as it is this day
[1:58:05] to save much people
[1:58:08] alive now therefore fear ye not isn't
[1:58:12] that familiar words I go back to the
[1:58:15] Book of Joshua be strong and of a good
[1:58:18] courage don't be afraid because
[1:58:20] everywhere the soul of your foot tread
[1:58:22] in this promised land it's your
[1:58:23] possession Every Word of Promise in the
[1:58:27] book is mine and it becomes that to us
[1:58:30] brothers and sisters now therefore fear
[1:58:32] ye not I will nourish you and your
[1:58:36] little ones and he comforted them and
[1:58:39] spake kindly unto them I just can't help
[1:58:42] but think the compound Revelation for me
[1:58:44] today in this scripture is that he will
[1:58:46] nourish us and our little ones if we're
[1:58:49] willing to come if we're willing to put
[1:58:51] him first if we're willing to trust in
[1:58:54] the Lord with all of our hearts that we
[1:58:56] know that he's leading every single
[1:58:58] thing is happening according to his will
[1:59:00] and his will is according to his word
[1:59:03] now therefore fear ye not we don't have
[1:59:05] to be afraid we know that love casts out
[1:59:07] fear all fear doesn't it I will nourish
[1:59:12] you and your little ones and he
[1:59:14] comforted them and spoke kindly to them
[1:59:16] and Joseph dwelt in Egypt he and his
[1:59:19] father's house and Joseph lived and 110
[1:59:24] years isn't this
[1:59:26] beautiful and Joseph saw ephraim's
[1:59:29] Children of the third
[1:59:32] generation can you imagine that of the
[1:59:35] third
[1:59:37] generation the children also of Meer the
[1:59:41] son of Manasseh were brought upon
[1:59:44] Joseph's knees as an old man he got the
[1:59:48] great great grandchildren up upon on his
[1:59:52] knees and Joseph said unto his Brethren
[1:59:56] I die and God will surely visit you and
[2:00:00] bring you out of this
[2:00:02] land unto the land which he swear to
[2:00:06] Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob as I was
[2:00:10] reading this I thought boy oh boy if
[2:00:12] there was ever a person that ever heard
[2:00:14] the prophecy of God and believed it that
[2:00:17] was the man to think about all the
[2:00:20] things that happen in his life how God
[2:00:22] led him through every single fire every
[2:00:24] single Valley every single trial every
[2:00:28] single Victory to know that was God in
[2:00:30] his life and to know that God promised
[2:00:34] that that's going to happen in verse 25
[2:00:37] and Joseph took an oath of the children
[2:00:39] of Israel saying God will surely visit
[2:00:41] you and ye shall carry my bones from
[2:00:45] hence so Joseph died being 110 years old
[2:00:50] they inomed him and he was put in a
[2:00:53] coffin in Egypt and you know we've
[2:00:56] talked about the Exodus we've talked
[2:00:59] about it a fair bit I'm not going to
[2:01:00] preach on that today but we know the
[2:01:02] children of Israel when they left when
[2:01:04] Pharaoh finally said get out after his
[2:01:08] heart was hardened thoroughly and he
[2:01:10] said get out take you all the women all
[2:01:12] the children take all your flocks and
[2:01:14] herds take whatever you want go and take
[2:01:17] as much gold as much food just leave
[2:01:20] this land when they did did they
[2:01:22] actually went and they took Joseph as
[2:01:25] well and they took Joseph into the land
[2:01:27] of Israel I can see I'm running out of
[2:01:29] time I had a giant quote here but I
[2:01:30] don't think I'm going to read it just
[2:01:32] because it's too
[2:01:35] long but I just thought it was
[2:01:39] interesting anybody know of the place
[2:01:42] called
[2:01:44] Mella in Israel Mella some people might
[2:01:47] have visited it I think it would be a
[2:01:49] really neat place to visit this place is
[2:01:52] where the Patriarchs were buried this is
[2:01:55] the place the land that Abraham bought
[2:01:58] the cave that Abram bought Abraham
[2:02:01] bought this for his wife Sarah and
[2:02:03] apparently all of the Patriarchs are
[2:02:04] buried there and there's stories about
[2:02:06] supernatural events happening people
[2:02:08] trying to get into the tombs and and
[2:02:11] going blind people seeing lights all
[2:02:13] kinds of different things I wouldn't
[2:02:15] want to go because I'm Supernatural uh
[2:02:18] spook chaser I'm not into that at all
[2:02:21] but I just think it's interesting
[2:02:22] because this is an actual place their
[2:02:24] bones weren't just scattered to the wind
[2:02:26] they actually went to a very specific
[2:02:28] place for a very specific reason because
[2:02:31] there is coming a day brothers and
[2:02:32] sisters where those bones will rise
[2:02:34] again there's no senu on those ears but
[2:02:38] they're going to have ears to hear what
[2:02:39] the spirit saith unto the church in
[2:02:41] their day and you know what there's
[2:02:43] coming a time where someone is going to
[2:02:45] stand at that SRE and put their
[2:02:48] shoulders back and they're going to say
[2:02:50] come forth with a voice that's not a
[2:02:53] voice of a man and it's not going to be
[2:02:55] specific to any one person it's going to
[2:02:57] be to everyone who is truly elect out of
[2:03:00] all the ages and when that happens all
[2:03:02] of those graves are going to burst and
[2:03:04] all of those Patriarchs are going to
[2:03:06] come out of those tombs I just think
[2:03:08] it's pretty powerful to think there's
[2:03:10] that many Patriarchs in one place this
[2:03:13] is a burial site of the Patriarchs it
[2:03:15] says a rich folklore has developed about
[2:03:17] the shrine and its history of those
[2:03:19] buried below this is Google according to
[2:03:21] Jewish Christian Muslim Legends not only
[2:03:24] are the Patriarchs and their wives
[2:03:26] buried in Mella but also Adam and Eve
[2:03:30] right Esau and the twel sons of Jacob
[2:03:33] some Jewish Traditions hold that the
[2:03:36] path to the Garden of Eden lies within
[2:03:38] the cave right and isn't that the wisdom
[2:03:41] of man brothers and sisters because we
[2:03:43] know that we've been given away back to
[2:03:45] the tree of life and it's not through a
[2:03:48] cave it's not through a shrine that was
[2:03:50] built by some man the way back to the
[2:03:53] tree of life is through Jesus Christ the
[2:03:55] same yesterday today and forever the
[2:03:57] Holy Spirit who is Alive and Well in our
[2:04:00] midst maybe stand with me this morning
[2:04:02] as we close amen I want to get into the
[2:04:06] the stories of Daniel as we go forwards
[2:04:09] I just think it's really important
[2:04:10] remember brothers and sisters his will
[2:04:11] is his word and so long as we're willing
[2:04:14] to take his word Thy word have I hid in
[2:04:17] mine heart that I might not sin against
[2:04:21] thee th that word has got to be in our
[2:04:23] lives and so long as it is you're in his
[2:04:26] will doesn't matter what we encounter it
[2:04:28] doesn't matter what trial or tribulation
[2:04:30] comes our way because when we're in his
[2:04:33] word we can say Lord where are
[2:04:37] you and he might not answer you right
[2:04:39] now but he will answer and he will
[2:04:42] deliver he delivers us from all of the
[2:04:45] evil in our lives we have so much to be
[2:04:48] thankful for let's just bow in prayer
[2:04:51] gracious heaven father Lord we love you
[2:04:53] we thank you for the story of Joseph
[2:04:55] thank you for the Revelation Lord the

[2:05:03] allow you to be Lord in our lives we
[2:05:06] have your word we can say that we have
[2:05:09] your word but not live according to the
[2:05:12] statutes that you've given us father we
[2:05:15] pray that you would just help us Lord to
[2:05:17] to open your word and to see your
[2:05:20] reflection

[2:05:23] wouldn't see ourselves but that we would
[2:05:25] see you according to the way that you
[2:05:28] created us
[2:05:29] Lord and we know that we were created in
[2:05:32] your very
[2:05:33] image so we pray that Lord Jesus as we
[2:05:36] open your word and we begin to read it
[2:05:38] that Lord we wouldn't see ourselves
[2:05:41] father that we would stop seeing
[2:05:42] ourselves reflecting back but that we
[2:05:44] would see you more and
[2:05:47] more Lord I just want to ask that you
