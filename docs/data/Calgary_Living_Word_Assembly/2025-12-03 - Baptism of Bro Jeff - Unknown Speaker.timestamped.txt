[0:14] Praise the Lord.
[0:30] I'm sure
[0:49] both
[1:25] Thank brother Henry for his efforts to
[1:28] make this
[1:31] as accommodating as possible. I hope
[1:35] it will be. We might even get better
[1:38] Jeff just to like go on his knees here.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; If you do that, that'll work. Just go on
[1:45] your knees here and then
[1:47] I'll just pull you back. I trust you.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; Well, come on in, brother.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; Brother John.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; Wow. Big crowd. [laughter]
[2:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; Thankful to be gathered here together.
[2:12] gave brother John panicker my phone but
[2:15] we have recordings being made so we'll
[2:17] be fine it's all good bless you everyone
[2:21] as we gather together here to witness
[2:23] the the testimony of brother Jeff Page
[2:28] and his desire to actually take a stand
[2:32] for the Lord
[2:34] and uh we know many times the devil is
[2:36] absolutely against this if there's one
[2:39] thing the devil doesn't want it's for us
[2:41] to actually come according to God's
[2:42] word.
[2:43] &gt;&gt; Because if we come according to God's
[2:45] word as we have many of us experienced,
[2:48] then we truly get the gift, the ultimate
[2:51] gift of the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; And the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[2:56] going to give us the ability to line up
[2:57] with God's word. Outside of his life,
[2:59] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it's
[3:01] impossible, literally impossible for a
[3:03] human being to line up with the word of
[3:05] God. And that's why the prophet taught
[3:07] us clearly that the evidence, the true
[3:09] evidence of the Holy Ghost in our lives
[3:11] is being able to say amen to the word.
[3:13] And that means to live the word, not
[3:15] just agree to the word, but by agreeing
[3:18] to it, we
[3:19] &gt;&gt; live it.
[3:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:21] &gt;&gt; And you know, I think it's beautiful
[3:22] because it goes even further than that.
[3:23] We just become it.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; We are the word made flesh today. It's
[3:28] what the scriptures say.
[3:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:29] &gt;&gt; That's the song we sing.
[3:32] So we just uh we just are certainly
[3:34] thankful that we can gather together
[3:36] this way one more time in the presence
[3:38] of everyone. Amen.
[3:40] &gt;&gt; Uh brother Jeff's testimony on his own
[3:42] was that he wanted to do this dedication
[3:44] of his life, rededication of his life in
[3:47] front of the church body
[3:50] &gt;&gt; as witnesses for his church family that
[3:54] he's made this stand.
[3:56] &gt;&gt; And uh I just think there's no greater
[3:58] desire in the life of a believer.
[4:01] I truly count it an honor and a
[4:02] privilege to be able to stand here with
[4:04] our brother.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; He's become a real good friend of mine
[4:07] and uh I just am so thankful to be able
[4:10] to stand with my brother.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; Let's just have a word of prayer.
[4:15] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank
[4:17] you for this day. Thank you for this
[4:19] opportunity to gather, Lord, the the way
[4:22] that you've ordained for us in your
[4:23] word, Father. That
[4:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, if we are willing to take
[4:27] you at your word, then you're willing to
[4:28] bless us with your spirit.
[4:30] &gt;&gt; And Father, that's what we need in the
[4:32] age in which we live. When we talk about
[4:33] rapturing faith, it's nothing other than
[4:36] your life literally living through us.
[4:38] And [clears throat] outside of that,
[4:40] there's no way that we will see the
[4:42] rapture. Father, we pray that you would
[4:44] just be glorified in all that's said and
[4:45] done here tonight. Father, we pray that
[4:47] you would keep your hand upon Brother
[4:49] Jeff Page all the days of his life. That
[4:52] you would lead him and guide him in all
[4:53] of his decisions. Lord,
[4:55] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would just help
[4:57] erase the past from his memory.
[4:59] &gt;&gt; Father, we know there's scars in our
[5:01] lives that we can't do anything about,
[5:03] but we know that you can help.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to commit each and
[5:06] every one of those scars into your hands
[5:08] tonight in the life of Brother Jeb. Lord
[5:11] Jesus, that when the world looks at
[5:12] Brother Jeb, they wouldn't see a man
[5:14] scarred from the past, but that they
[5:16] would see the literal life of Jesus
[5:18] Christ walking on earth again. Father,
[5:21] we pray for your glory that you would
[5:22] just bless Brother Jeff in every area of
[5:25] his life. Keep sickness away, Lord. Lead
[5:27] him and guide him into all
[5:29] righteousness. We ask
[5:31] &gt;&gt; Father, most of all, we pray that you
[5:32] would just bless him with your spirit in
[5:34] a way like he's never experienced before
[5:37] in his life,
[5:38] &gt;&gt; Lord. And I'm sure he'll be careful to
[5:40] give you the praise. And Father, we as
[5:42] witnesses, as family in this assembly,
[5:44] will stand and rejoice with our
[5:46] brethren.
[5:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, we love you and we thank you.
[5:49] commit this service on our brother into
[5:52] your hands now for your glory. In Jesus
[5:54] Christ's name we pray.
[5:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; So you know in Acts chapter 2 the people
[6:04] they saw the people the believers
[6:07] spilling out of the upper room. They had
[6:09] been baptized with the Holy Ghost and it
[6:13] was visible in their lives.
[6:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; And in our lives it's visible.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. when we get the baptism of the
[6:19] Holy Ghost. It is not an invisible union
[6:23] &gt;&gt; of the heavenly bridegroom and the
[6:25] earthly bride.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; But the people in Acts chapter 2, they
[6:28] saw these people, they heard them
[6:29] speaking in their own dialects, in their
[6:31] own tongues, and they said, "How can
[6:33] this be?" And we know that Peter, he
[6:34] preached up a storm. He preached a
[6:36] sermon.
[6:37] &gt;&gt; And at the end of it, now when they
[6:39] heard this, this is verse 37 of Acts
[6:41] chapter 2, they were pricricked in their
[6:43] heart. They heard the preaching of the
[6:45] word. and they were pricricked in their
[6:46] heart and said unto Peter and to the
[6:48] rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren,
[6:50] what shall we do?"
[6:53] Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and
[6:56] be baptized every one of you in the name
[6:59] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[7:02] sins, and ye shall receive the gift of
[7:05] the Holy Ghost." For the promise is unto
[7:08] you and to your children and to all that
[7:10] are a far off. That's us. Amen.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; Even as many as the Lord our God shall
[7:16] call.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:17] &gt;&gt; So tonight
[7:18] &gt;&gt; we come according to Acts chapter 2.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; And we don't baptize in the name of the
[7:23] Father and the name of the Son, the name
[7:24] of the Holy Ghost even though we do
[7:26] because all of those are combined in the
[7:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:34] So now, Brother Jeff,
[7:36] &gt;&gt; by the profession of your own faith,
[7:39] we're going to baptize you in the name
[7:41] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; Not just so that you can get the gift of
[7:45] the Holy Ghost, but for the remission of
[7:46] your sins, for all the old scars, for
[7:49] all of the old life.
[7:50] &gt;&gt; You no longer have to look back. That
[7:52] song that I sent you.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[7:55] &gt;&gt; When God looks your way, he no longer
[7:58] sees a sinner.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[8:02] Amen.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:05] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Jeff Page,
[8:07] &gt;&gt; by the power vested in us as believers,
[8:12] &gt;&gt; we're going to baptize you in the name
[8:13] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; And when the devil comes around and
[8:17] tries to make you doubt, you just remind
[8:18] him of this night.
[8:21] &gt;&gt; And just so you know,
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Just look over there. You're being
[8:24] recorded.
[8:26] [laughter]
[8:27] &gt;&gt; So, you could look back and you can see
[8:29] it. So, if you just want to step
[8:31] forward, brother
[8:33] &gt;&gt; and uh as I said, just Yeah, just do
[8:36] that.
[8:37] &gt;&gt; We're going to have a tsunami here.
[8:40] [laughter]
[8:41] &gt;&gt; Jeff, I baptize you in the name of the
[8:43] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[8:45] your sins.
[8:53] [applause]
[9:03] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[9:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name.
[9:10] Blessed [singing] be the name [music] of
[9:14] the Lord.
[9:18] Blessed be the name. [music]
[9:22] Blessed be the name.
[9:26] Blessed be the [singing and music] name
[9:29] of the Lord.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
