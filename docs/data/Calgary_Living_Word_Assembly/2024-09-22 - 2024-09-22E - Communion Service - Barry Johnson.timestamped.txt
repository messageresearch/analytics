[42:50] tonight I know it can be a long service
[42:54] so I'll try not to keep you long if you
[42:56] turn with me to John chapter
[43:00] 6 John chapter
[43:03] 6 is where
[43:06] Jesus began to explain to the people who
[43:09] he really
[43:11] was and we know that they could not
[43:14] receive his
[43:16] explanation because they were looking at
[43:18] it truly through a a natural
[43:23] circumstance John chapter 6 verse 26
[43:30] Jesus answered them and said verily
[43:33] verily I say unto you you seek me not
[43:37] because ye saw the
[43:39] Miracles but because ye did eat of the
[43:42] Loaves and were
[43:44] filled labor not for the meat which
[43:48] perisheth but for that meat which
[43:50] endureth unto everlasting life which the
[43:54] son of man shall give unto to
[43:57] you not a man not a Ministry but the son
[44:01] of man shall give unto you for him hath
[44:07] the God the Father
[44:09] sealed then they said unto him what
[44:13] shall we do that we
[44:15] might might what shall we do that we
[44:20] might work the works of
[44:23] God Jesus answered and said unto them
[44:27] this is the work of God that ye believe
[44:31] on him whom he hath
[44:35] sent they said therefore unto him what
[44:39] sign showest thou then that we may see
[44:43] and believe thee what doest thou work
[44:48] what Dost thou work our fathers did eat
[44:52] Mana in the desert as it is written he
[44:55] gave them bread
[44:57] from Heaven to
[44:59] eat then Jesus said unto them verily
[45:02] verily I say unto you Moses gave you not
[45:07] that bread from heaven but my father
[45:10] giveth you the true bread from
[45:13] heaven for the bread of God is he which
[45:17] cometh down from heaven and giveth life
[45:20] unto the world then said they unto him
[45:24] Lord Evermore give us this
[45:28] bread excuse me and Jesus said unto them
[45:32] I am the bread of life am he that cometh
[45:35] to me shall never hunger and he that
[45:38] believeth on me shall never thirst amen
[45:41] let's just bow in prayer one more time
[45:44] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[45:45] word thank you Lord that you came down
[45:48] and you showed us father the true bread
[45:50] of life am and thank you Lord that you
[45:53] gave us the work that we should do
[45:56] father it's not by works of
[45:57] righteousness but by your grace alone
[45:59] father and we accept it the way that
[46:01] you've given it to us father and we just
[46:03] ask now that you would bless the words
[46:05] that are spoken tonight bless each one
[46:07] father for their desire to come onto
[46:10] your table tonight we love you and we
[46:13] thank you we ask all these things now in
[46:15] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen

[46:23] seated I just think it's such a a
[46:26] wonderful time to get together for the
[46:28] communion service it's something that is
[46:30] very sacred and we know the disciples
[46:33] had the opportunity of being there and
[46:36] the world today makes a mockery of this
[46:39] and we know that it's not even the world
[46:41] so much as the devil that does it and
[46:44] we're just certainly thankful that we
[46:45] have been given ears to hear what the
[46:47] spirit says unto the
[46:51] church talking about our scripture
[46:53] tonight Jesus talking to the religious
[46:58] folks and his disciples just the whole
[47:00] group who was standing around and trying
[47:03] to be partakers of what's going on the
[47:06] the meetings that were at hand and Jesus
[47:09] begins to explain to them that I am the
[47:12] bread of life amen and you think that
[47:15] Moses gave you the bread in the
[47:17] wilderness but I'm here to tell you that
[47:20] it had nothing to do with Moses it had
[47:22] everything to do with My Father which is
[47:24] in heaven and he's the one that actually
[47:27] sent me to declare him to you and as you
[47:31] partake of what I bring to you you will
[47:34] be able to actually have eternal life
[47:38] verse 36 of John chapter 6 but I said
[47:42] unto you that ye also have seen me and
[47:46] believe not all that the father giveth
[47:49] me shall come to me and him that cometh
[47:53] to me I will in no wise cast out
[47:58] these people must have been thinking at
[47:59] this time about this time who is this
[48:02] guy he's making himself sound like he's
[48:04] got some kind of authority that he has
[48:07] some sort of special placement in the
[48:09] kingdom of God but we know what they
[48:13] said just a little bit further on isn't
[48:15] this Joseph's son how could he be
[48:17] declaring these words to us that he came
[48:20] down from heaven who is this guy how
[48:23] dare he make himself equal with God
[48:27] it's just beautiful the way he did it
[48:28] though because I I I know we're probably
[48:30] very familiar with it I'm not going to
[48:32] read the quote tonight but I just want
[48:33] to throw this part in there is that when
[48:35] he started to talk this way to the
[48:37] people is when he started to declare
[48:39] that I am my father are one and that's
[48:41] when they picked up stones to kill him
[48:43] amen but this man he actually wasn't
[48:47] declaring anything other than what he
[48:50] was and that's what got them so riled up
[48:53] they could not they could not stand it
[48:56] that he would dare have such a
[48:58] Blasphemous statement that I and my
[49:00] father are one but here we have not
[49:03] Jesus as a different person as a second
[49:05] person or a third person of the Trinity
[49:08] we have God himself amen manifest In the
[49:10] Flesh speaking to the most religious
[49:13] folks of the day as well as his
[49:16] disciples and we know that 70 of these
[49:18] people they just couldn't stand it they
[49:20] just couldn't stand it they had to walk
[49:22] away because of what he says a little
[49:23] further on here I just want to read this
[49:25] just for the setting the background
[49:28] here verse 37 all that the father giveth
[49:31] me shall come to me and him that cometh
[49:34] to me will I in no wise cast out for I
[49:38] came down from heaven not to do mine own
[49:40] will but the will of him that sent me
[49:44] and this is the Father's will which hath
[49:46] sent me that all that of all which he
[49:50] hath given me I should lose nothing but
[49:53] should raise it up again at the last day
[49:56] isn't that beautiful he didn't come down
[49:58] to punish people he came down to raise
[50:01] people up at the last day am that's his
[50:03] words and this is the will of him that
[50:06] sent me that everyone which seeth the
[50:08] son and believeth on him may have
[50:11] everlasting life and I will raise him up
[50:13] at the last
[50:16] day but the Jews then murmured at him
[50:21] because he said I am the bread which
[50:23] came down from
[50:25] heaven and they said is not this
[50:28] Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and
[50:32] mother we know how is it then that he
[50:35] saith I come down from heaven and here
[50:38] we have Jesus God In the Flesh
[50:42] manifesting before
[50:44] them Jesus therefore answered and said
[50:47] unto them murmur not amongst yourselves
[50:50] can you imagine what that must have been
[50:51] for them they would have been like wow
[50:54] he's hearing us how does he know what
[50:56] what we're saying because murmuring
[50:58] isn't coming right out and saying it
[50:59] it's saying it around behind someone's
[51:01] back right in 44 he says no man can come
[51:04] to me except the Father which hath sent
[51:07] me draw him and I will raise him up at
[51:10] the last day wow who raises anyone up
[51:15] except for God we heard that this
[51:17] morning verse 45 it is written in the
[51:20] prophets and they shall be all taught of
[51:23] God every man therefore that hath heard
[51:25] and hath looked learned of the father
[51:27] cometh unto me amen not that any man
[51:31] hath seen the father save he which is of
[51:34] god he hath seen the father
[51:38] amen verily verily I say unto you he
[51:41] that believeth on me hath everlasting
[51:43] life amen and now he doesn't back away
[51:46] from these statements he actually leans
[51:49] into them he begins to present them more
[51:51] I am the bread of life let's go back and
[51:55] talk about your fathers in the
[51:56] Wilderness your fathers did eat Mana in
[51:58] the wilderness and are dead and we know
[52:01] the prophet in our day he wasn't talking
[52:03] about them passing on going to being
[52:06] buried in the cemetery with their
[52:08] fathers with their families he wasn't
[52:09] referring to that at all he was
[52:10] referring to the Eternal separation
[52:13] being eternally separated from God
[52:15] because they didn't have faith in their
[52:17] hearts to mix with the word that was
[52:19] given to them by the prophet to receive
[52:22] that
[52:23] word your fathers did eat Mana in the
[52:25] wilderness and are dead this is the
[52:28] bread which cometh down from heaven that
[52:30] a man may eat thereof and not die I am
[52:36] the living bread which came down from
[52:37] heaven If any man eat of this bread he
[52:40] shall live forever and the bread that I
[52:43] will give is my flesh which I will give
[52:47] for the life of the
[52:49] world so he's talking about the
[52:53] word the word yes and he talking about
[52:57] his flesh this flesh we all have this
[53:00] flesh the flesh had to perish his flesh
[53:05] was perfect he was the sinless one he
[53:07] was the only one without sin even when
[53:09] they put him under examination they
[53:11] could find no fault in him so what did
[53:13] they do they brought false accusations
[53:15] against him and that's the only way they
[53:17] were able to actually persecute him to
[53:19] death but what happens is here he is now
[53:23] saying that you know there is the word
[53:26] of God God and that is the meat that is
[53:29] the flesh that you need to eat it's the
[53:31] words that I bring but they had no way
[53:34] to actually separate what he was saying
[53:36] from the natural circumstances aren't
[53:38] you thankful tonight to be able to get
[53:40] the inner teacher to be able to get the
[53:42] Holy Ghost someone that would lead you
[53:44] and guide you into all truth that we
[53:47] would look at this word and be able to
[53:49] just understand that he was talking
[53:50] about the word he wasn't talking about
[53:52] the flesh but he knew exactly what he
[53:54] was doing he had to stir the them up
[53:57] amen he had to get them excited a bit so
[53:59] that they would actually persecute him
[54:01] to death and it was exactly the way that
[54:03] it needed to be he didn't force them to
[54:05] do anything right they acted as free
[54:08] will agents and that's what made him the
[54:10] sacrifice for all of us I am the living
[54:14] bread which came down from heaven If any
[54:16] man eat of this bread he shall live
[54:17] forever and the bread that I will give
[54:21] is my flesh which I will give for the
[54:24] life of the world the true tment that
[54:27] blood cell that was broken on Calvary 52
[54:30] the Jews therefore strove among
[54:32] themselves saying how can this man give
[54:33] us his flesh to eat then Jesus said unto
[54:37] them verily verily I say unto you except
[54:39] ye eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[54:42] drink his blood ye have no life in you
[54:47] who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[54:49] blood hath eternal life and I will raise
[54:51] him up at the last day for my flesh is
[54:53] meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed
[54:55] he that eateth My Flesh drinketh my
[54:58] blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the
[55:01] living father hath sent me and I live by
[55:04] the father so he that eateth me even he
[55:08] shall live by me this is the bread which
[55:11] came down from heaven not as your
[55:14] fathers did eat mana and are dead he
[55:17] that eateth of this bread shall live
[55:21] forever
[55:24] amen that would have been a a very
[55:27] stunning statement that he made that
[55:30] service there would have shocked every
[55:33] single person that would have been there
[55:35] and we know I got a couple of quotes
[55:36] here we'll quickly go through but the
[55:38] prophet said you know they they just
[55:40] didn't know what to do with them they
[55:41] didn't know what to do with them I I'll
[55:43] just read these next few verses here
[55:45] bring the quotes and then we'll just
[55:46] carry on with the service here these
[55:48] things said he in the synagogue as he
[55:50] taught in capernium many therefore of
[55:52] his disciples when they heard this they
[55:54] said this is a hard saying who can hear
[55:57] it who can hear it when Jesus knew in
[56:01] himself that his disciples murmured at
[56:03] it he said unto them does this offend
[56:06] you what and if ye shall see the son of
[56:09] man Ascend up where he was before it is
[56:12] the spirit that quickeneth amen the
[56:15] flesh profiteth nothing the words that I
[56:18] speak unto you they are spirit and they
[56:22] are life
[56:23] amen and he told them that some of them
[56:26] couldn't couldn't handle it some of them
[56:28] couldn't believe it we know that Jesus
[56:30] said to them blessed are your eyes for
[56:32] they see the things of God a and many
[56:35] people were not able to understand not
[56:37] even able to understand and truly
[56:39] probably had Hearts where they really
[56:41] wanted to they really wanted to try and
[56:44] understand but there's sometimes things
[56:46] in our lives that we're just not willing
[56:48] to give up on and we know Nicodemus was
[56:50] an example of that he was one that went
[56:52] and sought him privily after dark so
[56:54] nobody would know and he was the one
[56:56] that said to him we know Master we know
[56:58] that the things you're doing is only of
[57:00] God no one else could do these things
[57:03] except for God himself
[57:06] right we got to be willing to set aside
[57:08] our own thinking our own understanding
[57:10] am and just say hey I don't really
[57:12] understand it but I just believe the
[57:14] word and that's all out of the Seal of
[57:17] God in
[57:20] 1954
[57:22] Josephus a famous Christian historian he
[57:25] said those ible type people who have
[57:28] been eating the body of this Jesus of
[57:31] Nazareth said they hid his body away and
[57:34] they've been eating of
[57:36] it they was eating the
[57:39] communion said that they them Bunch back
[57:42] there them
[57:44] Heretics that's what they were those
[57:47] people that were eating the flesh nobody
[57:49] took the body of Jesus and started
[57:51] eating it starting cutting parts of his
[57:54] body and started eating it we know
[57:56] that's the devil trying to spin this and
[57:59] make it something that it's not he he
[58:01] spoke about the bread of life and and
[58:04] it's about taking the word we know that
[58:05] he said that man shall not live by bread
[58:08] alone but by what by every word that
[58:12] proceedeth out of the mouth of God these
[58:14] were the historians that should have
[58:15] known these words but uh they were more
[58:18] interested in their tradition they were
[58:20] more interested in the way they've
[58:21] always done things and that it should be
[58:23] done the way that it was and and truly
[58:26] they were rounding a corner and it's
[58:27] beautiful to think you know we had a
[58:29] prophet in our day say you know what
[58:31] he's not building a wall it's not just
[58:33] going straight he's actually making a
[58:34] corner and you got to follow the
[58:36] blueprint we're building a
[58:37] three-dimensional house here we're
[58:39] building the Tabernacle of the most high
[58:41] God we need to be able to not be stuck
[58:44] in Tradition and not stuck in our ways
[58:46] so much that we don't follow the word
[58:48] for our day and let go of all the things
[58:51] we heard our brother pray about it
[58:52] earlier tonight we need to forget about
[58:54] our lives forget about our years forget
[58:56] about our Ambitions and recognize
[58:58] tonight we're here to discern the Lord's
[59:00] body and where is the Lord's body
[59:03] brothers and sisters we can have the
[59:04] bread this is this is this is bread that
[59:07] was made and we have the wine and we
[59:10] know those represent things but that's
[59:11] not his body that that's in remembrance
[59:14] of today he has a body and it is the
[59:18] bride body it's our brothers and our
[59:21] sisters and we we wash one another's
[59:23] feet whose feet are we washing brothers
[59:25] and sisters
[59:26] M the voice of the sign 1964 brother
[59:29] Bram he says now we notice that that in
[59:33] the great hour he said except you eat
[59:35] the Flesh of the son of man drink his
[59:37] blood could you imagine what people
[59:40] thought is this man out of his mind
[59:43] remember the Jews they were given the
[59:45] Ten Commandments they were given the
[59:47] laws of Moses they were given very
[59:51] specific instructions and when it came
[59:52] to a dead person they weren't allowed to
[59:55] go near it that's right if they touched
[59:58] a dead body they had to go and actually
[1:00:00] cleanse it wasn't a simple thing to just
[1:00:04] go and and and and come across someone
[1:00:07] who is dead to to deal with someone
[1:00:09] else's body if they had leprosy they had
[1:00:12] Specific Instructions for it there was
[1:00:13] the law Moses gave the law God gave
[1:00:16] Moses Moses gave the law we know how it
[1:00:19] went but for these people to now hear
[1:00:22] this man who is sounding a little bit
[1:00:24] like a heretic a IC around them to be
[1:00:27] saying you got to eat my flesh and drink
[1:00:31] my
[1:00:32] blood that is that is beyond
[1:00:35] imaginable but that's what he said and
[1:00:38] you know he said it for a purpose
[1:00:39] brother Bram told us he said it because
[1:00:41] he needed to thin out the people he
[1:00:42] needed to thin out the herds he needed
[1:00:44] to get down to the place where he could
[1:00:46] really deal with the individuals that
[1:00:48] were called am and that's exactly what
[1:00:50] he's doing today now we notice that in
[1:00:52] that in that in that great hour he said
[1:00:56] except you eat the Flesh of the son of
[1:00:58] man drink his blood could you imagine
[1:01:00] what people thought is that man out of
[1:01:03] his mind does he want us all to turn
[1:01:08] Cannibal and now perhaps he'll go out
[1:01:11] somewhere and kill himself and we're
[1:01:13] supposed to eat his flesh and drink his
[1:01:15] blood see they never understood it and
[1:01:19] we know there's many many spins that
[1:01:21] were put on his death some people
[1:01:23] brother Bram talks about it I think it's
[1:01:25] in the rapture that he drank man Drake
[1:01:28] weed they gave it to him and and what he
[1:01:31] did was it put him to sleep for a few
[1:01:32] days and then he he came awake again and
[1:01:35] then ran up into India somewhere and
[1:01:37] died I I don't think that's actually
[1:01:38] what happened is it it was St Thomas
[1:01:40] that brought the gospel one of the 12
[1:01:42] that was actually there one of those
[1:01:44] guys he's the one that brought the
[1:01:46] gospel to India it wasn't Jesus that
[1:01:47] went up there to die Jesus actually his
[1:01:50] flesh he laid it down as the sacrifice
[1:01:53] in Palestine that's where it happened
[1:01:55] but could you imagine what people
[1:01:57] thought is this man out of his mind does
[1:01:59] he want us to all turn Cannibal and now
[1:02:02] perhaps he'll go out somewhere and kill
[1:02:03] himself and we're supposed to eat his
[1:02:05] flesh and drink his blood that's exactly
[1:02:07] what this Josephus said they must be
[1:02:09] eating his flesh we know that they
[1:02:12] weren't willing to accept the
[1:02:13] supernatural circumstances around the
[1:02:15] death burial and resurrection of Jesus
[1:02:17] Christ we know the centurions they fell
[1:02:19] on their face when that angel of the
[1:02:21] Lord came and broke that seal on that
[1:02:23] tomb and rolled the stone away and said
[1:02:25] now he's
[1:02:27] risen he has risen he is no longer in
[1:02:30] this grave and what happened was the
[1:02:32] leaders the religious leaders of the day
[1:02:34] they weren't ready to let go of this
[1:02:35] Theory because they didn't want to have
[1:02:37] anything to do they were caught now
[1:02:38] between the people and they were caught
[1:02:40] between Rome they didn't want an
[1:02:41] uprising so what did they say they got
[1:02:43] they paid off these these guards to say
[1:02:46] that he actually just escaped and he ran
[1:02:49] off somewhere he his disciples took him
[1:02:52] they they they took him away and nobody
[1:02:54] knows what happened to him but surely to
[1:02:56] goodness he couldn't have risen from the
[1:02:58] dead everybody wants to put their own
[1:03:01] spin on it the devil especially wants to
[1:03:03] put his own spin on it but we know as
[1:03:05] Believers we've been given the ability
[1:03:07] to partake of this body to eat this
[1:03:10] flesh and drink this blood and we know
[1:03:12] the flesh is the word and the blood is
[1:03:15] the wine the actual life that he gives
[1:03:18] us by eating the word as we eat the word
[1:03:20] we become the word and I just want to
[1:03:23] encourage us tonight to never ever be
[1:03:26] afraid of the communion table brothers
[1:03:27] and sisters this is the instruction that
[1:03:30] the lord gave us amen you know brother
[1:03:32] bradam he says it in the church age book
[1:03:34] never let anything come between you and
[1:03:38] that word and when this is an
[1:03:40] instruction of the Lord to do this this
[1:03:41] isn't something that is just a really
[1:03:44] nice ordinance of the church that's put
[1:03:46] out there and you know you can do it
[1:03:48] once in a while if you feel up to it
[1:03:50] this is an instruction of the Lord and
[1:03:52] one of the reasons for it is we can't
[1:03:55] have any guidance in our
[1:03:56] hearts we can't do this we can't come
[1:03:59] before this table because to do it it
[1:04:02] actually means that we're going to eat
[1:04:03] and drink damnation to ourselves that's
[1:04:06] why we need to take a moment and T one
[1:04:09] for another to make sure that if we've
[1:04:10] got anything in our heart that the Lord
[1:04:12] will forgive us for it but what do we
[1:04:15] feel like when we leave this communion
[1:04:17] service every single I don't think I've
[1:04:19] ever left a communion service and felt
[1:04:20] bad anybody here ever felt bad after
[1:04:22] leaving a communion
[1:04:23] service it doesn't happen does it it
[1:04:27] because happy are ye if you do these
[1:04:30] things and I'll tell you for sure 100%
[1:04:34] by experience unhappy are you if you
[1:04:40] don't when you know to do it and you
[1:04:42] don't do it it doesn't make you happy
[1:04:45] yes works is Faith
[1:04:47] expressed our works determine who we are
[1:04:50] our works show who we are works is Faith
[1:04:53] expressed 1965 except you eat the Flesh
[1:04:57] of the son of man and drink his blood he
[1:05:00] didn't explain it he didn't go to him
[1:05:02] and say well now this is the word and
[1:05:05] this is the wine and this is the blood
[1:05:07] and D D D D D D D he wanted to actually
[1:05:10] thin it out I think it's amazing how he
[1:05:12] says this he didn't explain it he said
[1:05:15] except you eat the Flesh of the son of
[1:05:17] man and drink his blood you have no life
[1:05:19] in you shocking to them why I imagine
[1:05:23] some doctors and nurses said that's
[1:05:25] fellows a vampire trying to get us to
[1:05:27] drink his blood see they didn't
[1:05:30] understand it and he knowed it but them
[1:05:33] disciples them disciples this is what
[1:05:36] got me a little bit excited when I heard
[1:05:38] brother Frank praying them disciples
[1:05:40] there's the disciples back there but
[1:05:41] then there's the disciples right here
[1:05:44] them disciples they might not have been
[1:05:46] able to explain it but they sat there
[1:05:49] and believed it anyhow amen for it was
[1:05:51] revealed to them yes sir they know it
[1:05:54] the scriptures had declared it amen so I
[1:05:58] just want to say tonight brothers and
[1:05:59] sisters God bless you because them
[1:06:02] disciples they didn't understand it they
[1:06:05] couldn't explain it but they just
[1:06:07] believed it and that's the that's the
[1:06:09] commission for us today is not
[1:06:11] necessarily to understand it all but
[1:06:13] just believe it and you know as we
[1:06:15] believe it as we eat it we become it and
[1:06:18] that is really what's happening that's
[1:06:20] what it's all about tonight I just want
[1:06:22] to change the order of the service now
[1:06:24] and go into the communion service
[1:06:27] if you will turn with me in your Bibles
[1:06:28] to 1 Corinthians
[1:06:31] 12 maybe stand to your feet as we read
[1:06:35] this as we change the order of the
[1:06:41] service if we could sing number 430
[1:06:45] marvelous Grace for the
[1:06:49] communion 1 Corinthians chap
[1:06:52] 12 actually 11 um we say
[1:06:56] 12 1 Corinthians 11:
[1:07:02] 23 it says for I have received of the
[1:07:05] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[1:07:08] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:07:11] in which he was betrayed took
[1:07:14] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:07:17] break it and said take eat this is my
[1:07:22] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:07:26] remembrance of
[1:07:27] me after the same manner also he took
[1:07:31] the cup when he had SED saying this cup
[1:07:36] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[1:07:39] ye as of as ye drink it in remembrance
[1:07:43] of
[1:07:45] me for as often as ye eat this bread and
[1:07:49] drink this cup ye do sh the Lord's death
[1:07:53] till he come amen
[1:07:56] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:07:58] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:08:01] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:08:05] and blood of the
[1:08:07] Lord but let a man examine himself and
[1:08:10] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:08:14] of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:08:17] drinketh
[1:08:18] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:08:21] to
[1:08:22] himself not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:08:26] amen for this cause
[1:08:29] many are weak and sickly among you and
[1:08:32] many sleep for if we would judge
[1:08:35] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:08:38] when we are judged we are chasen of the
[1:08:40] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:08:43] with the world Hallelujah wherefore my
[1:08:45] brethren when you come together to eat t
[1:08:48] one for another and if any man hunger
[1:08:50] let him eat at home that ye come not
[1:08:53] together unto condemnation and the rest
[1:08:57] will I set in order when I
[1:09:00] come I think it's so beautiful this is
[1:09:04] what we do here brothers and sisters if
[1:09:06] we would judge ourselves we should not
[1:09:08] be
[1:09:09] judged but when we are judged we are
[1:09:13] chasen of the Lord that we should not be
[1:09:15] condemned with the world and that's why
[1:09:17] we come here so that we can be chasen of
[1:09:20] the
[1:09:20] Lord chastening of this flesh is no good
[1:09:24] nobody likes it
[1:09:25] but it shows whose side we're on it
[1:09:27] shows who our father is when we're
[1:09:29] willing to come in subjection to this
[1:09:32] word it shows that we love him amen
