TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign God bless you um last week when we were at brother clary's church I was speaking and it was one of those moments like for the brambles say he was coming fresh and and the Lord was just making us to realize that there was a time when the blood of bulls and Rhymes and goats was what was God's provided way but God knowing that that will not bring the believer to perfection he made sure that he came in flesh to die for us and I was saying that it's it's a discredited to the blood of Jesus if we live a double life is it discredits the blood of Jesus if we come and accept this and go back with the consciousness of sin and I just want to sing this song this morning it's titled Softly and Tenderly Jesus is Calling if Jesus hasn't yet been personally revealed to you he is still calling if you have actually had the experience of receiving the Holy Ghost but the brand said if you desire more of God it's because there is more to be had may you be blessed this morning [Music] Softly and Tenderly Jesus is calling calling for you and for me [Music] see on the portals he's waiting and watching and watching for you and for me come home come home [Music] come home learn Nestle tenderly my Jesus is calling calling or seener come home why should you Terry when my Jesus is bleeding pleading for year and for me [Music] why should we linger and eat nuts his Mercy Mercy for you and for me come home come home [Music] honestly Tenderly [Music] Jesus is calling calling oh sinner come home time is now fleeting the moments are passing pass it for year and for me Shadows are coloring let alerts all coming coming for you and for me come home thank you come home come home [Music] come home come home right now oh earnestly tenderly my Jesus yes call it calling or Cedar come home oh oh for the wonderful love is promised promised for you don't we have seen my Jesus he's got a lot of mercy and pardon pardon for you and for me [Music] come home foreign [Music] oh my God endlessly eternally my Jesus is Calling calling for years [Applause]
