hands For Your Glory we love you and we thank you we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight thank you musicians if you have your Bibles I'd like to read from Revelation the first chapter as we get back into our study of the exposition of the seven Church ages I personally just can't really get enough of this it's really doing something for me I hope it is for you too Revelation chap 1 we'll just pick up from where we left off last Wednesday and uh that's the golden lampstands that's Revelation 1 verse2 and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for this word thank you for the vision you gave John and thank you Lord for the Revelation that we've been able to receive in our day for it Lord and Lord if we have any Revelation that's not in line with your word or not in line with what your messenger brought father we pray that you would just forgive us for it Lord help us to get quickly in line with the correct Revelation father for our day we love you and we thank you we just commit all these words into to your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated just a couple of announcements we've got Jim night coming up um Friday night we got a prayer meeting February the 15th that'll be at 7:30 here in the church um we have a youth event for February uh I'm not sure what the date is now we got a Youth Event coming up this month and I'll have to get back to you on that it on the 18th but I have that date wrong so forgive me uh we have the annual General men's meeting at the church in the basement here February 29th that'll be at 7:30 I believe that's a Thursday as well and uh just a good time to get together with all the brothers talk about church business are you happy tonight last week we uh finished off talking about the golden lampstands and you know about the vine and how the Vine doesn't bear fruit the branches are what bears the fruit and brother brandham goes into talking about very clearly how you get many times a grafted Affair you get uh branches that are grafted in to the church and uh I would say the church Universal the mystical body of Jesus Christ you get branches that are grafted in and they live off the life they even thrive off of the life and they bear different fruit and many times you have to scratch your head and wonder how how come is that the case but here we have a dispensational prophet that brings the answer to that they haven't actually been borne into it because when they've been borne into it what happens is the inside of the branch it has the same trunk as the original tree and even though it can live off the life when it brings forth fruit when that Branch brings forth fruit it matches the original tree it doesn't bring forth a different fruit I think it's just so amazing when we look at this brother brandham says but if the vine ever brings forth another branch of itself that Branch will be exactly like the vine itself it's not going to be bearing different fruit and saying well I believe many people believe and uh it doesn't actually line up with the word and you know brother Brown talks about that in in the message tonight we'll get into it I think it's just it's astounding when we realize that many people will claim to believe the message but have their own belief structure based around the message and because of that they don't have the same fruit that the original tree has and and it's terrible but that's true it's very true and it's so good that we had a prophet imagine if we didn't have a prophet in our day a dispensational prophet a major prophet that God would would send to the the Earth to say you know what everyone has their own way and all the churches are wrong most people if you talk to them if they have been a Christian for any while in their life if they were really honest they would say they're all kind of corrupt it's all about business and operations and and image it's all about looking good but not actually seeing the manifestation of the fruit of the spirit in their lives and that really is the bottom line that's what brother brandham brought we've got to be able to actually manifest the fruit of the spirit that's the fruit we're talking about we're not talking about oranges or apples or pears or nectarines or tangelos or anything like that we have got to have the fruit of the spirit if if we can say that we love God but yet we don't love our brother there's something wrong with our experience it's bearing a different fruit I if if we can come to church and and and maybe worship freely and and and say Amen to the word of God but then go and slander a brother or a sister there's something wrong with that fruit that's another Branch that's grafted in it's thriving off the life but it's not bearing the right fruit if we come to church and we worship and everything is is Grand it's fantastic we have a a tremendous tenure of going to church but we have a terrible family life there's something wrong with that Branch it's thriving off the life but what did a family say what does the wife say what do the children say who's daddy is he the same person that he is in church whose mommy are they the same people that everybody sees we've got to have the fruit of the spirit in our lives when we do we'll actually live it we won't even have to preach we won't even have to say a word the people around us in the world will say what is that about you do you serve God do you do you have a a religion what is the problem why do you act so different people will know it denominations which are not M directed cannot be born of God for it is the spirit not man that gives life you know brother Ram goes on to talk about it uh I I probably I won't go too far into that we'll just get into uh no longer the priest Revelations 1: 13 it's on page 50 of the exposition of the seven Church ages Revelations 1:13 says and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gir about the paps with a golden girdle there he stands one like unto the son of man as the jewel is beautified by the mounting of the ring so he is glorified in the midst of the churches isn't that just beautiful he is glorified in the midst of our church tonight right here he says it's the Lord's day for John sees him standing not as a priest but as the coming judge the golden girdle is no longer Girt around the waist where the priest must wear it as he ministers to God in the holiest place but it is now around his shoulders for he is not now the priest but the judge and you know brothers and sisters we have been given such a tremendous opportunity it just was was weighing so heavy with me today I uh I just was thinking about it what it will be like after the the Rapture of the church what the world will be like here after the Rapture of the church and and we have the opportunity right now to actually look judgment right in the face to look face to face with the Lord Jesus Christ to give ourselves on that altar right now and we have that opportunity and to have No Reservations about it but if we hold back if we have any reservations about it if we're not willing to just go all the way into Christ and get that Holy Spirit then you know what's happening is he is already judging that judge is already there his eyes are already as a flame of fire even though it hasn't actually come to pass naturally speaking it's already happened in the Lord's day now has John 5:22 come to pass for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son his service has been rendered the priest her hood is over the days of the prophecy are finished he stands girded as the judge I just can't help but think about how far down the road we are from when this book was even published 1965 how close are we to seeing that that being that's being described here that judge the white wigged one we'll get into to that in a little bit the Sevenfold Glory of his person his head and his hair were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in its strength that's Revelations 4 14- 16 1 14-6 How Deeply moving and inspiring was the appearing of Jesus to John who is in exile for the cause of the word and behold the Living Word now stands before him what an Illuminating vision for every descriptive attribute has a significance what a revelation of his glorious being I think it's so great the way brother bradam says that every single Des descriptive attribute has a significance and so he goes into it and and they're numbered one his hair as white as snow John first notices and mentions the whiteness of his hair it was white and bright as snow this was not because of his age oh no the brilliantly white hair does not signify age but experience maturity and wisdom and you know the Bible talks about the Hy head and how it has that that that person has experience and wisdom and here we have God choosing to manifest himself to identify himself in this format it's for a specific purpose it it shows it signifies The Experience maturity and the wisdom the Eternal one does not age amen what is time to God time means little to God but wisdom means much it as it is as when Solomon called to God for wisdom to judge the people of Israel now he is coming the judge of all the Earth he will be crowned with wisdom that is what the white and glistening hair signifies now he goes into Daniel chapter 7: 9-14 I beheld till the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like a fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him and a thousand thousands ministered unto him and 10,000 times 10,000 thousand stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were open I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake I beheld even till the Beast was slain and its body destroyed and given to the Burning Flame as concerning the rest of the beasts they had their Dominion taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before me and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people Nations and languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed amen he says there it is Daniel saw him with that white hair he was the judge opening the books and judging out of them Daniel saw him coming in the clouds that is exactly what John saw and isn't it beautiful because it's exactly what the disciples saw in the book of Acts when they told them the two men standing there in white apparel what what are you doing here don't stand here and look up he's gone but they saw Jesus raise up into clouds they both saw him exactly the same they saw the judge with his judgment girdle over his shoulders standing pure and holy full of wisdom fully qualified to judge the world in righteousness hallelujah amen even the world understands this symbology this always got me this always kind of surprised me when I heard this it just makes perfect sense it's a little bit like the original sin in the Garden of Eden what happened there but this here even the world understands this symbology for in ancient times the judge would appear in convene Court dressed in a white wig and a long robe that signified his complete Authority head to foot robe to meet out Justice two his eyes as fire than of it those eyes that were once dimmed with tears of sorrow and pity those eyes that wept with compassion at the grave of Lazarus those eyes that saw not the evil of the murderers who hanged him on the cross but in sorrow cried father forgive them amen now those eyes are a flame of fire amen the eyes of of the judge who will recompense those who rejected him and it's so amazing to think about brothers and sisters it's not even those who actually maybe did something terrible to him throughout the ages just those who rejected him that's who he's going to recompense all of the human emotions he manifested the most when he appeared as the son of man was this one he wept often you ever get into the presence of God Amen you ever find yourself weeping and just know there's something special going on it's something that you can't even control amen hallelujah it's such a beautiful place to be but you know you can look at this and say this is the identification this is one attribute that Jesus had when he was here he wept often yet behind that weeping and that sorrow there was still God you remember brother bradam in that story The Woman said you put too much on Jesus and he said' whatat are you talking about and she said Jesus isn't God how could he cry at the grave of Lazarus and how on Earth could God not be man and God all in one it goes beyond our human comprehension to try and even understand it we just have to believe it but if God could create the universe he could come and stand in the form of a man amen there's no question about that and I think it's so beautiful because he could even do it in the form of an Angel because the word of God says that we entertain Angels sometimes unawares sometimes we don't even know who it is we're talking to and we could be talking to an angel yes amen it's a beautiful thing yet behind that weeping and the sorrow there was still God those same eyes saw Visions they looked deep within the hearts of men and read their very thoughts and knew all their various ways blazing out of mortal eyes was God who cried to those who knew him not for what he was I think it's beautiful when we can look at this and say you know he he he he had the ability to look deep into the hearts of men and you know we even had a prophet here that was able to look deep within the hearts of men but I want to say this when we have someone in involved in the five-fold ministry and and they begin to preach and an anointing comes down they have the ability to see into the hearts of men and maybe not like the prophet did or even like Jesus did but sometimes they'll start preaching about something and they'll wonder why am I preaching about this and someone in the audience or the congregation will be saying wow something is going on maybe somebody talked about something we've we've gone on and on about this brothers and sisters that's the Lord Jesus Christ amen yes same God Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Jesus Christ that white wed one Jesus Christ the one with fire in his eyes Jesus Christ with feet as brass as fine brass representing judgment John 8:24 says if ye believe not that I am he ye shall die in your sins my John 10:37 to 38 if I do not the works of my father believe me not but if I do the works of my father though ye believe not me believe the works that's where brothers and sisters when we have the fruit of the spirit we can preach all we want but we either have the fruit or we don't have the fruit we either have the works that prove who we are or we don't have the works paragraph 51 like Jeremiah of old he was the weeping prophet for men receive not the word of God and thrust aside the Revelation and we know that that whole entire city was just decimated destroyed by the king of the north but they were warned over and over and over if you read the book of Jeremiah over and over he kept coming back excuse me he kept crying to them crying out to them just repent repent repent and they just wouldn't they didn't like him they didn't think that he was maybe polished enough for them he didn't fit into their their clicks paragraph 52 those fiery flaming eyes of the judge are even now recording the lives of All Flesh running to and fro throughout the Earth there is nothing he does not know isn't it wonderful to think that brothers and sisters every time I hear that now I just sigh and say Amen Lord you know my heart just like Peter Peter and John all of them Lord you know our hearts Do You Love Me Oh Lord you know my heart I I I fail you all the time but you know my heart I I want to serve you with all my heart my desire is there he knows the desires in the heart and what each one intends to do amen there's nothing hidden that shall not be revealed for all things are naked before him with whom we have to do think of it he knows even now what you're thinking amen I just love that because you know where we are right now isn't necessarily where we're going to be down the road and it might not necessarily be where we were in the past but right now is really what counts brothers and sisters amen it's the Difference Maker in our lives because we only have this moment and then when we go forwards second hand goes a little further then we've got that moment and every single time it's a moment that's why God came and identified him self with Moses as the I am because every single second he's present and it's the same way for us tonight he knows our very thoughts he knows what we're going to do he knows how we're going to act and it's such a beautiful thing I remember when I first heard that there was a prophet in the Land There was a prophet in the land and he had the ability to discern the hearts of uh thoughts in the heart of men and I I said it very clearly I don't even know if I said it out loud but in my mind I was shouting it I ain't never going to that church I'm never going to go there because I don't want anybody to know what I've done I've not been a good person I've been a bad person in many different ways and you know I I thought that I have to hide myself and isn't it interesting because it's exactly the way Adam and Eve were in the garden they wanted to try and hide themselves they didn't want to expose thems to to God where everything before him was naked right but now the desire of my heart is to throw myself at the Lord search me and try me let me be a new creature in Christ Jesus I don't want to be the old man I don't want to be afraid I I want to know my Lord when he comes around I want to be thankful that he's around I want to invite him around thank like we talked about on Sunday there should be nothing that we could do out in the world that we wouldn't do in here right nothing that we would be embarrassed to bring into this building you know I could bring a rifle in here I wouldn't be embarrassed about that I like to hunt but I could bring it in here I could bring my hunting gear I'm sure brother Sam could do that we could bring our fishing gear we wouldn't be embarrassed about that but what about other things that we do in our lives would be embarrassed to bring those into the church and to the congregation of the Lord if we are then why are we doing them amen leave him alone and we can hide it hide it from church but we're not hiding it from God because he knows he knows exactly where we are he knows the desires of the heart and what each one intends to do there's nothing hidden that shall not be revealed for all things are naked before him with whom we have to do think of it he knows even now what you're thinking probably brother Barry you better quit harping on that but you know it's not just me I'll tell you that it's not just me it's the Lord yes there he stands as judge with flaming eyes to meet out judgment the day of Mercy is over oh that men would repent and seek his face in righteousness while they is yet time that they might make his bosom their pillow a the world dissolves in fire I was listening to a brother preaching about love and I just thought that's so fitting wouldn't we want to lay our head on his bosom wouldn't we just want to love on him wouldn't we just want him to love on us do we do that with our spouses are we able to if we aren't why aren't we because really our relationship with with our spouse is an example of our relationship with Christ it's a direct Earthly example of our relationship with God Almighty husband and wife remember in Ephesians he spoke about that being a mystery and he talks about husbands and wives loving your loving your your wives and and reverencing your husbands and and on and on and on but right at the very end he says I'm saying all this to say to you I'm not speaking about this I'm speaking about the mystery of God and his bride he knows exactly where we are but one thing about it there should be the desire in our heart just to love on him and we I know it for sure we all want him to love on us but are we willing to love on him that's what he's looking for brothers if you ever get married you're going to want to have a wife that's going to want to love on you and and it's going to be a direct example of what God is looking for you as a husband because the husband is the one that actually sanctifies the house and if the husband isn't in love with the Lord loving on the Lord then look out three the feet of brass and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace brass is noted for its remarkable hardness there is nothing that is known that you can put with it to temper it you know I I thought about this and and so I just considered it for a little bit and I've worked a little bit with metal and for those people that have worked with metal you'll understand what I'm talking about but you know what it means to temper it it doesn't mean to quench it necessarily you can actually change the Metallurgy of metal you can change the chemical composition of metal and make metal different actual uh I don't think they're elements but Alloys I would say and I'm not claiming to be an expert about it but I know this much you can take metal that's just a regular call it a tul steel a high-speed steel which is a very strong metal it has metallic composition it's an alloy so it's made up of different Metals but you can take it and actually heat it up get it just to the right temperature just a really good Cherry orange and then quench it and the way you quench it is in oil sometimes people will do it in water it it can go too quickly and and make the metal crack but if you quench it properly in oil you can make that metal so hard on what they call the Rock scale you can make it so hard you could take that metal and drop it on a concrete floor and it would shatter like glass that's how hard and brittle that metal would be but just a few moments earlier before you did that you could drop it on the floor and it would just make a clanging sound and it would just vibrate and land and maybe have a scratch or a dent on it but what I'm saying is when you temper that metal you you you actually take it from that really uh I think it's called martinz I I could Martin Zite Maybe but you take that metal once it's been hardened to its absolute hardest point and then you take it and you put it in an oven for a few different Cycles you'll put it in the oven at a certain temperature for a certain amount of time and then pull it out and let it cool down and then put it back in the oven and get it up to temperature for a certain amount of time and pull it out and let it cool down and what happens is every time you do that it softens the metal in a controlled state but it still gives you the ability to keep it really really hard that's your metal lesson for tonight but but what I'm saying is brother Bram talks about there's nothing that you can put with brass to temper it you cannot take away the hardness of brass it's there that way for a very specific purpose and I love the way he goes into the Brazen altar in a little bit here we'll get into that but there is nothing that is known that you can put to temper it but the this brass that describes his feet is more remarkable yet in that it has stood the test of the fiery furnace maybe it's been tested to see if it could actually come down from being so hard but it's not going to be that judgment is going to remain the same exactly according to his word his feet is more remarkable yet in that it stood the test in the fiery furnace a test that no other one has gone through and that is exactly right for brass signifies Divine judgment a judgment that God decreed and brought to pass in John 3:14 to19 and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil numbers 21 8-9 and the Lord said unto Moses make thee a fiery Serpent and set it on a pole and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he lookth upon it shall live and Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he h had beheld the serpent of brass he lived now we know that Israel had sinned Israel had sinned a terrible sin and God was fed up with them and so what did he do he sent fiery serpents through the camp through the two million people to let them know I'm done with you acting the way you are behaving like you're religious but just doing whatever you want to do just doing a tradition so now you're going to deal with the fiery serpents and you know isn't that kind of a type of the way things are for us in our day we have fiery serpents we've got tormentors devils and once in a while God will say you know what it's time to put a little pressure on it's time to actually get you looking back at me not looking at all of the things in the world Hallelujah Israel had sinned and God gave them away he made a provision for them he gave them the plague and you know what Aaron and Moses they followed the word of the Lord and they were able to stay the plague because they followed the word of the Lord the prophet for their day followed the word of the Lord and then they gave the message that message to the people who had sinned who were out of control who were busy doing their own things with their own thoughts gave them the instruction just follow the prophet's word and you'll live just look at that fiery Serpent and and know that he's not going to kill you if you look at that brass serpent on the pole what a tremendous thing that is to know that there was a provision made for them there was a way that God gave them so that they could live and you know we have the ability in our day to look away to Jesus and when we say we look away to Jesus the only way we can do it is through this message of the hour because many people claim they're looking away to Jesus but they'll still go out to the bar and have a drink and say everything's fine I'm saved everything is great there's no issue with us but what kind of example are they setting Israel had sinned brother Bram says paragraph 55 sin had to be judged so God commanded Moses to place a Brazen serpent on a pole and he who looked was saved from the penalty of his sin the Brazen serpent on the pole symbolized Sin from the Garden of Eden where the serpent beguiled Eve causing her to sin brass speaks of judgment as it is seen in the Brazen altar where the penalty for sin was met in the sacrifice upon the altar do you have that slide brother Logan and I didn't bring the pointer but it doesn't matter the line the dotted line is the temple in the wilderness that's the outer court and then we have the walls of the temple here the straight lines that is the Tabernacle and over here is the Brazen altar this uh brass looking thing here on the right and that's in the outer court and that is where the people came and actually gave their sacrifice offered their sacrifice on that altar the Brazen altar made of brass signifying judgment that's what brother bradam is talking about here that Brazen altar where the penalty for sin was met in the sacrifice upon the altar many times we talk about the Altar and I know as a child I often thought that the altar was like right here the stairs at the front of the building when we speak about altar in this context that's it there there was burning coals and the Flesh of the animal the insides the outsides there's very specific directions in in the Book of Leviticus I believe it is where God shows says exactly what's going to happen with this sacrifice but that was the sin altar that's where our sins were laid down and we have the opportunity obviously to to lay our sins down on our own Brazen altar of judgment with the Lord when we judge ourselves we should not be judged right brothers and sisters where the penalty of sin was met for the sacrifice upon the altar when God judged Israel for her sins in the Days of Elijah he withheld the rain and the fiery Heavens became as brass thank you brother Logan now in this illustration we see that the serpent upon the pole represents sin already judged for It's Made of brass showing Divine judgment had already fallen upon sin then whoever looked at the serpent on the pole accepting the significance of it was made whole for this was the work or salvation of the Lord now I just as I was studying it and and as I'm talking talking about it I just can't help but think you know the people who were living in sin who were committing sin because it wasn't I don't think it was just random people that got bit by snakes it was people that were actually sinning right it was the people that weren't living right a and the snakes came and they actually bit them and and when they got bit because who can live in this world without sinning but when they got bit I can imagine they had a very Hardy look at that serpent on the pole would you think they didn't look at it just with a sideways glance it it wouldn't have been just a you know just a quick glance and look away and do their own thing they would have been very very intently looking at that brass pole they would have been looking to see where that was they might even have brought binoculars or glasses with them to make sure that they would be able to see it very Crystal Clear they wouldn't be looking at two different things at the same time I just can't help but think it's just a beautiful thing we have the ability to look at it the serpent on the pole is a type of what Jesus came into the Earth to accomplish amen he was made flesh in order to take upon himself the judgments of God for sin the foundation of the altar of sacrifice was solid brass typifying the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world judgment had already passed upon him when as yet there were no Sinners I just think that's beautiful we can look at this and say yeah praise God I'm saved before the foundation of the world I'm saved if we truly catch that Revelation then we're going to live our lives according to the word of God Amen we're not going to be doing double standards we're not going to be living one way in church and then running out in the world and doing something else it's going to be the same same it's not going to be a different thing but you know what that judgment it's already passed brothers and sisters we have reason to Rejoice we have reason to praise it was already passed upon Him Upon Jesus when he was yet there were no Sinners salvation being entirely of the Lord he trod The Wine Press of the fierceness of the wrath of God Alone his vestures were died Crimson with his own blood the fiery furnace of the just judgment and wrath of God was his portion he suffered the just for the unjust Thou Art Worthy oh Lamb of God for thou Hast redeemed Us by thine own blood Isaiah 535 and6 he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon on him and by his stripes we are healed amen and the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all I think that's so beautiful brothers and sisters we could just take that and know that every time we ask the Lord to just take the iniquity out of the way he's already done it and he's just waiting for us to come to him in in acknowledgment with what he's already done that is such a beautiful thing he suffered as no man ever suffered even before the cross he had shed great drops of sweat like blood from his body as in the intense Agony of the ordeal ahead the very blood separated in his veins can you imagine that and being in agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground Luke 224 44 I'll never forget the first time I heard brother Ken preach this he said that the very first blood that touched the Earth was in The Garden of Gethsemane where he laid down his own will where he laid down his life that was where Redemption started on Earth the Earthly manifestation of it I thought my goodness how could I ever pray that much paragraph 59 but someday those feet of brass will stand upon the Earth and you know brothers and sisters that's not the second coming of the Lord that's not the second coming of the Lord that's going to be after we meet him in the air because the second coming of the lord we meet with him in the clouds first the dead in Christ rise and we together meet them and then we meet him in the sky but someday those feet of brass will stand upon the earth and the judge of all the Earth he shall be with equity and Perfection he will judge Mankind and there will be no evading that judgment no turning of that Justice there will be no tempering of it remember tempering it's not quenching in in the oil it's not putting it out tempering is actually changing the hardness of it there's going to be no changing the hardness of his judgment when that time comes he that is unjust will be unjust still he that is filthy will be filthy still the unchanging one will not change then for he will he never has and never will those feet of brass will crush the enemy they will destroy the Antichrist the Beast and the image and all that is vile in his sight he will destroy the church systems that have taken his name only to corrupt its Brilliance and crush them along with the Antichrist I just thought man this was written in 1965 hey isn't it interesting how all the Wicked the atheists the agnostics the modness the Liberals will all be there death hell and the grave will be there yes they will for when he comes the books will be open that is when even the lukewarm church and the five foolish virgins will appear he will separate the sheep from the goats when he comes he will take over the kingdom for it is his and with him will be the thousands times 10 thousands and you know brothers and sisters when we talk about this we don't have to have any fear any children that might be listening might be afraid thinking that there's going to be something fearful in that time and it will be but you know we're not going to be in in front of that Throne we're going to be in that Throne we're going to be with him in his throne there's no fear of standing before that Throne unless you choose not to accept this message of the hour the way that it's given to us if we choose to actually just negate it in any way then we may find ourselves Standing There Brother Bron goes on to say his bride who come to minister to him glory oh it's now or never repent before it's too late wake up from amongst the dead and seek God to what to be filled with his Spirit or you will miss eternal life do it now while there's time isn't it wonderful we still have time yes we have the ability to be filled with his Spirit without his Spirit we're not going to be there we won't be in that Throne just by saying we've got the message of the hour won't put us in that Throne brothers and sisters we've got to be filled with his spirit and when we're filled with his Spirit we become a new creature in Christ Jesus and we live our lives differently do it now while there's time he goes on to number four his voice was as the sound of many Waters now what do the waters represent in Revelation 17:15 the waters which thou s are peoples and multitudes and Nations and tongues his voice was as the sound of multitude speaking what is it it is the Judgment for these are the voices of the multitudes of witnesses who by the Holy Spirit All Through the Ages have testified to Christ and preached his gospel it will be the voice of every man rising in judgment Against The Sinner who will not take warning the voices of the seven Messengers will be heard loud and clear amen and I just can't help but think as we study this those voices are being heard loud and clear amen those faithful preachers who preached the saving power of Jesus who preached water baptism in jesus' name who preached the infilling and power of the Holy Ghost who stood with the word more than they stood with their own lives all of them were the voice of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost down Through the Ages John 17:20 neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word isn't that beautiful Jesus prayed for us in the garden he prayed for us when he prayed for his disciples there he prayed for everyone all that believe on him through their word through our testimony have you ever ever thought how terrifying it is to a man drifting helplessly toward a cataract think of it now as think now of that Roar as he approaches his sure and certain doom and just exactly like that day sorry and just exactly like that is coming the day of judgment when the Roar of the multitude of voices condemns you you for not having paid heed air it was too late take heed this very hour for at this moment your thoughts are being recorded in Heaven There your thoughts speak louder than your words like the Pharisee who claimed so much with his mouth but not listening to the Lord his heart became corrupt and Evil until it was too late even now this could be your last call to hear the word and receive it unto eternal life it will be too late when you approach the Roar of the many voices of judgment and doom that's why I just was thinking tonight you know how when we come to service those people that just craved to worship God in in spirit and in truth freely and were restricted they were persecuted for it and we have full complete Liberty to do it the way that he has given in our day and for us to not give all all we've got our very best they're the ones their voices are going to be saying you actually could have worshiped you could have done that and you didn't but you believed what's wrong why wouldn't you do it it's amazing to think about even now this could be your last call to hear the word and receive it unto eternal life it'll be too late when you approach that the Roar of the many voices of judgment and doom but have you ever noticed how sweet and relaxing the sound of water can be i' like to fish I'd like to find a spot where the water is whispering in ripples do you ever do that you ever just go out in the woods and find a stream and just lay back and have a little nap beside it just listening to the water it's it's a wonderful thing if you've never done it I highly recommend it get in a beautiful day and just go and and and and enjoy it it's interesting how brother Brandon brings this comparison hey the Roar of the voices of the people the Roar of the Cataract the Roar of the Doom if you've ever been to a place where there's waterfalls it's very terrifying thing it's very loud and distracting but when you get into a place where where it's really slow and and just Rippling it's so calm and soothing it's a beautiful thing brother bradam says I can just lay back and hear it speaking peace and joy and contentment to my heart we're all real familiar with the artisian well that brother bam talks about how it just keeps bubbling up the water just keeps coming out of the ground it's bubbling it's bubbling it's bubbling in my soul that's kind of like a Believer right and he says why why are you so happy why do you keep bubbling and he's he's imagining that it's saying back to him you know it's just coming from the inside I just can't stop it it's just who I am nothing's going to stop it from coming forward I can't contain it it's beautiful he says I can just lie back and hear it speak peace and joy and contentment to my heart how glad I am to be anchored in the Haven of Rest where the voice of the Lord speaks peace as the word of waters of Separation hath declared how thankful we should be to hear his voice of love and care and guide idance and protection you know brothers and sisters it's just something that's been on my heart and I I really want to talk about it going into the future here but we we we talk about the voice of the Lord the voice of the Lord and many times we can say the voice of the Lord is the voice of the Vindicated prophet and that's true because he had thus sayith the Lord but what about the voice of the Lord in you because if you don't have the voice of the Lord in you then you don't have the Lord now that might be real tough and strong maybe it's it's wrong and and erroneous and I would certainly be interested in a conversation but we have got to have a personal relationship with him and brother bradam says it I know he says it that we've got to be willing to talk to him and go on our knees and spend time in prayer but then we've got to be just as willing to sit back and listen what are we listening for listening for his voice and if we can't hear his voice then we need to work on tuning things out in our life quieting things down maybe go and get by a brook a stream maybe go and sit on a mountain or in a valley whatever we need to do but get quiet enough to allow him to speak to us and I know brothers and sisters that he speaks to us all the time we just need to get quiet enough to hear it that's all brother Brown goes on to say some someday we will hear that same sweet voice speak not in judgment but in welcome to us whose sins have been remitted by his blood whose lives have been Spirit-filled and whose walk was in the word what could be more precious than to hear the multitudes of welcoming voices and be surrounded by those multitudes who have believed unto eternal life oh there is nothing like it I pray that you will hear his voice and Harden not not your heart but receive him as your king oh if you would only see it it was the waters that destroyed the world but it was the same Waters that saved Noah and also saved the whole earth for Noah yes listen to his voice the voice of his servants as it calls to repentance and life five in his right hand were Seven Stars I just want to go back and just uh mention this because I think it's important uh here with [Music] me maybe I won't be able to find it yeah and no sorry in his right hand were seven stars and he had in his right hand Seven Stars now of course we already know from verse 20 what the Seven Stars actually are and the Mystery of the Seven Stars are the Angels messengers of the seven churches now we couldn't make a mistake here on any account as he interprets us interprets it for us these Seven Stars Are The Messengers to the seven successive Church ages they are not called by name they are just set forth as seven one to each age from the Ephesian age on down to this leodan age each messenger brought the message of Truth to the people never failing to keep it the word of God to that particular Church age each one held to it they were steadfast in their loyalty to the original light amen and it's wonderful to think that we're steadfast as well as each age pulled away from God his faithful messenger turned that age back to the word their strength was from the Lord or they never could have stemmed the tide they were safe in his care for nothing could pluck them out of his hand and neither could anything separate them from the love of God Let It Be sickness Peril nakedness famine sword life or death they were truly yielded to him and kept by his omnipotence they were not concerned about the persecution that came their way pain and derision was but caused to give glory to God that they were counted worthy to suffer for him and in thankfulness for his salvation they burned with the light of his life and reflected his love and reflected his patience and reflected his meekness and reflected his Temperance and reflected his gentleness and reflected his faithfulness and God backed them up with wonders signs and Miracles they were accused of being Fanatics and holy rollers they were denounced by organizations and held in mockery but they kept true to the word now it's not hard to stand up and be true to a Creed it is easy for the Devil is right behind all that but it is something else to be true to God's word and to to go back to what the word originally produced at Pentecost brothers and sisters tonight I just want to say to us it is something else to go back it's something else to be true to God's word yes but we've got to be true not only to the printed word of God and the message of the hour we got to be true to that word in our heart amen and if that word in our heart is truly the word of God then it will line up with the word in print and it will line up with the message in print yes sir because the spirit and the bride will all be saying the same thing the spirit the prophet and the bride will all be speaking the same language it won't be different language it won't be something for a different age it'll be the same same same I think it's just so beautiful and in thankfulness for his salvation they burned with the light of his life and reflected his love patience meekness Temperance gentleness faithfulness and God backed them up with wonders signs and miracles and they were accused of being Fanatics holy rulers they were denounced by organizations and held in mockery but they kept true to the word amen now it's not hard to stand up and keep true to a Creed it's easy for the Devil is right behind all that but it is something else to be true to God's word and to go back to what the word originally produced at Pentecost and I believe with all my heart that all of us want to see that in our lives in our homes in our church when we see the devil come in like a flood we want to be able to stand as that standard against that enemy and and just withstand that flood and rebuke the devil and not have condemnation in our heart if we've got condemnation in our heart we can't have confidence towards God can we we have to say oh my I'm going to have to go and have a prayer meeting first before I can rebuke that devil but what about if you need that prayer right now what about that we have to be on our guard brothers and sisters the devil is going about as a roaring lion not long ago a man said to me that the Roman Catholic church had to be the true church as it had been true to what it believed over all the years and kept growing and not changing I can't help but think it can be real easy for us as message Believers to do the same thing it's the way we've done it all these years and everything is fine God blesses me I've got a good job I got a good career we got a good family we're healthy everything is fine is it if it's not in line with the word brothers and sisters we need to get in line with the word it's not just the Catholic Church brother br says that isn't so at all any church with the government behind it and with its own Creed which isn't the word at all and with no manifested Ministry to cause the devil to get aroused could surely carry on that was not a Criterion maybe I should call them musicians but when you think of that little group whose members were saw aunder fed to Lions persecuted and driven from excuse me Pillar To Post and yet stayed true to the word now definitely that would have to be God how they survived their Battle of faith and carried on still that is a miracle and yet sometimes people can maybe have someone say something to them and they'll get upset and leave church what are we going to say when we get to meet those voices of our brothers and sisters on the other side and this Comfort is not for the seven Church AG Messengers only brothers and sisters maybe stand with me as we close with this paragraph and this Comfort is not for the seven Church age Messengers only every True Believer is in the hand of God and can draw from his love and power and receive the full benefit all that God is to the believer what God gives the messenger and How He blesses and uses the messenger is an example to all believers his goodness and care to all members of his body amen it's our promise brothers and sisters don't look for someone else don't just put it off on the prophet say be it unto me according to Thy word let's just bow in prayer tonight heavenly father thank you for your goodness amen thank you for your mercy Lord thank you for giving us hearts Lord that desire to feed upon the unfailing body word oh Lord Jesus of the Lamb you have given us so much in our day father Lord we thank you for the services on Sunday Lord and the communion service with you Lord Jesus to

what it is about us but first let us live it Lord Jesus father we thank you for your goodness and your mercy to each one of us Lord we pray that you would just continue watching over us Lord as we go our separate ways tonight and if it Be Your Will for us ga again on Sunday Lord Jesus we'll be careful to give you all the praise Lord Jesus that you've placed in our hearts father we won't Reserve anything we'll give it all to you thank we love you and we thank you we just commit all of our ways into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen can we sing Turn Your Eyes Upon [Music]
