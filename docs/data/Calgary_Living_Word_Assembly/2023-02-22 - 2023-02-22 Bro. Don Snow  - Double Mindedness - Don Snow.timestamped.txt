[40:02] in your word Lord were just for me and
[40:04] my family Lord but
[40:07] it was never really enough father

[40:33] nervousness Lord
[40:35] father we know we're in your will in our
[40:38] heart fathers just the flesh lord it's

[40:41] being surrendered in this way
[40:44] father Lord we just commit ourselves

[40:48] this service father this Fellowship
[40:50] for your honor and glory Lord
[40:53] May no one look at the man father Lord
[40:57] but listen to the word and recognize
[40:59] that voice father
[41:00] your voice you said your sheep know your
[41:03] voice they recognize your voice Lord
[41:05] wherever it may come from Lord
[41:08] that always has to come out of the
[41:10] revealed word of the hour it has to be
[41:12] supported by that it has to be
[41:14] fortified by it Lord father we love you
[41:17] and appreciate you Lord and thy will be
[41:19] done this day Lord Jesus Christ's name
[41:22] amen
[41:27] greet you all in the name of the Lord
[41:29] a little bit of a surprise I guess for
[41:32] some of you was a little bit of a
[41:34] surprise for me I thought
[41:36] it wasn't going to be till March 29th
[41:38] but
[41:39] it's interesting how God does things
[41:41] because for the last two weeks he's been
[41:44] really driving me into the word to
[41:47] for this message and then yesterday the
[41:49] pastor reached out to me of course
[41:51] under the inspiration of a couple
[41:53] Services last few Services I'd go him
[41:55] and like brother I don't think I could
[41:56] wait till the 29th I don't think I can
[41:58] wait just feeling the inspiration from
[42:00] the brothers and the men of Pastor and
[42:02] that here and uh so he called me
[42:05] yesterday and he's like brother you go
[42:07] you tour I'm like I sure can I'm ready
[42:09] and willing
[42:11] so here we are so I hope it's a blessing
[42:13] to you I believe it will be a blessing
[42:14] to you this is not
[42:16] my words my thoughts
[42:19] I pray that that comes across tonight
[42:22] but what we'll do is we can turn first
[42:24] in your Bibles and we'll go to John John
[42:27] 10.
[42:37] if I was having to put a meth a title or
[42:39] something on this really the overall
[42:41] theme
[42:42] it's out of the invisible Union but it's
[42:45] about recognizing election
[42:48] but tonight the first half of the
[42:50] invisible Union it's more of a warning
[42:52] before he gets to
[42:54] the reward that's promised to us and
[42:56] it's about double-mindedness so tonight
[42:59] we're actually going to be talking uh on
[43:01] double-mindedness
[43:02] but there's a blessing on the other side
[43:04] of it if you can overcome it
[43:07] so John 10
[43:13] anyway
[43:15] verses 27 to 30.
[43:22] my sheep hear my voice
[43:25] and I know them
[43:28] and they follow me
[43:30] and I give unto them
[43:33] eternal life
[43:34] and they shall never perish
[43:38] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[43:41] my hand
[43:43] My Father which gave them me is greater
[43:46] than all and no man is able to pluck
[43:49] them out of my father's hand
[43:51] I am my father are one
[43:54] the next scripture we'll go to is John
[43:57] 13. verse 36.
[44:14] he says Simon Peter said unto him Lord
[44:18] whether goeth thou and Jesus answered
[44:20] him
[44:21] whether I go thou canst not follow me
[44:24] now
[44:24] but Thou shalt follow me afterwards
[44:28] and then the last portion of scripture
[44:31] for now Saint John 14 verse 6.
[44:38] it says Jesus said unto them I am the
[44:42] way the truth and the life no man cometh
[44:45] unto the father but by me amen
[44:49] can take your seat so I don't want to
[44:52] keep you standing
[44:55] so tonight I just want to
[44:58] share with you I call it my testimony
[45:02] but it's just places
[45:04] where
[45:06] God is really strengthened my faith and
[45:09] anchored my soul
[45:11] in such a way that I never ever thought
[45:14] possible coming from a backslidden
[45:16] condition to things that he's done for
[45:18] me
[45:19] but Above All Else he's anchored me in
[45:21] his word
[45:27] last year I started this testimony I
[45:29] gave account of the earlier stages of my
[45:32] walk but I really wanted to get to this
[45:34] portion but this part really concerns
[45:37] about my faith and where it's anchored
[45:39] I'm compelled like I said to talk to you
[45:41] about the invisible Union that he
[45:44] ministered and the things that he showed
[45:45] me in there that I pray it'll be a
[45:47] blessing to you
[45:49] and this isn't about me the man Donald
[45:51] snow it's about
[45:53] the real me the inner me identified and
[45:56] anchored in Christ
[45:58] please don't look at me don't think I
[46:00] have a real complex about me standing up
[46:02] here thinking people are going to think
[46:04] I'm that's not it at all I don't want to
[46:06] be up here I don't want to be recognized
[46:09] for anything I just want you to see him
[46:11] and hear the testimony that I have
[46:15] I no longer Harbor any thoughts of my
[46:17] own concerning this word
[46:19] I check any and all thoughts and ideas
[46:21] by the reveal word of the hour
[46:24] and if the word corrects it I drop it
[46:27] immediately
[46:28] if it proves the idea to be true I
[46:31] embrace it
[46:32] and I let it guide me into further truth
[46:34] the Roman Candle effect
[46:36] that's the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[46:38] today
[46:39] it's the washing by the word
[46:43] I believe we're all in agreement that
[46:45] after the seals opened in 1963 the
[46:48] ministry changed it was more about focus
[46:51] on calling out the bride
[46:53] and a majority of the message became
[46:55] prophetic he was started pointing to a
[46:58] time down the road it became more
[47:00] prophetic
[47:03] the word of that time clearly Vindicated
[47:05] who he was and who he is
[47:08] and the scripture told of a Time
[47:10] according to God's calendar it should
[47:13] have placed him perfectly in scripture
[47:15] according to the calendar of God's word
[47:17] and it pointed to the Future for a few
[47:20] for a further fulfillment plainly the
[47:22] prophet's message produced the great
[47:24] light
[47:25] that is prophesied to return and ripen
[47:28] the word into our hearts
[47:31] the prophet himself was a sign he was
[47:34] the wave chief
[47:35] and through the seventh Angel's message
[47:38] came the perfect revealed word of God we
[47:40] can all agree on that it's a light by
[47:42] which we have our being we move
[47:44] everything our Mortals and objectives
[47:45] everything we do we always check and see
[47:48] if it lines up to the word we're so
[47:51] we're so guaranteed in that word and
[47:53] we're so sold out to it that we always
[47:55] want to find our position in that word
[47:58] this is the perfect word for the perfect
[48:00] washing to produce perfect Faith it's
[48:03] got to come out of this word
[48:06] continually point it to another time
[48:08] when the full understanding would break
[48:10] forth upon the body of Believers and
[48:12] achieve its ultimate goal a time of
[48:15] maturity and harmony
[48:17] it was prophesied to be
[48:20] despite the body having received the
[48:22] open book
[48:24] he said a supernatural element still
[48:26] remained in this uh is this the signs of
[48:30] the end sir
[48:31] in 1962 he said the Mysteries here's the
[48:35] the mystery a mystery is a scripture
[48:37] this previously hidden truth now
[48:40] divinely revealed but which is a
[48:43] supernatural element Still Remains
[48:45] despite the revelation
[48:47] he said the greater Mysteries and the
[48:50] great Mysteries are and this is
[48:51] paragraph 244 and he starts listing he
[48:54] listens about 11 of them
[48:56] and there's the serpency there's the
[48:59] kingdom
[49:00] there's uh water baptism there's Christ
[49:03] being the fullness of the godhead baldy
[49:05] he lifts about 11 then he goes on he
[49:07] listens about another 10 but not naming
[49:10] them but he was talking about all of the
[49:12] truths that the seventh messenger was to
[49:14] clear up all the Loose Ends but he's
[49:17] saying despite those being revealed
[49:20] there's still a supernatural element
[49:22] still remained pointing to a time when
[49:25] they would come and be made manifest to
[49:28] a body of believers
[49:31] I'm just going to drop down here
[49:36] he said but the mystery though these
[49:38] Mysteries are divinely revealed as
[49:40] Supernatural elements still remained
[49:43] so simply put
[49:45] he told us that there's a difference in
[49:47] receiving the message and accepting it
[49:49] as truth the knowledge of Jesus Christ
[49:52] versus actually receiving he himself
[49:54] personally
[49:56] the person of the word the light of the
[49:59] world
[50:00] time had to be permitted for the message
[50:02] and the prophecy to mature it had to
[50:04] follow God's pattern Prophet prophecy
[50:07] then there's time permitted and then
[50:09] that prophecy comes to pass
[50:12] some of us might think it was a long
[50:13] time but according to God he actually
[50:15] shortened the days and it's been one of
[50:17] the shortest times that a prophet to
[50:19] Prophet prophecy to manifestation
[50:21] actually has taken place he said he's
[50:23] shortened the days lest no flesh be
[50:25] saved that's how dark
[50:26] the hour that we live in is
[50:30] we went through the childish times like
[50:32] a child wearing our Daddy's boots
[50:34] stumbling around impersonating via
[50:36] legalism
[50:37] then the teenage years of know-it-alls
[50:39] quoting quotes to show maybe we got
[50:41] something that no one else has splitting
[50:43] up the body into groups and clicks and
[50:45] scattering but that's all the will of
[50:47] God
[50:48] he has this every time it scatters the
[50:51] body but then God comes and he promises
[50:53] to heal and bind and restore
[50:56] and I think we can all say we've we can
[50:58] see that that that happened over the
[51:00] last 60 years
[51:04] I know I love how the Holy Spirit
[51:07] presents his mystery truths excuse me
[51:13] every word in the message
[51:15] the titles everything is carefully
[51:17] selected and thoughtful
[51:19] every detail lying within its pages are
[51:23] meaningful
[51:24] from the scriptures that he selects
[51:26] the ones that he mentions or even only
[51:28] references
[51:30] from the songs that are sung same thing
[51:32] we've seen tonight brother Joe I sure
[51:34] appreciate your your prayer brother I
[51:36] was in the back nerve you prayed all my
[51:38] nerves went away
[51:40] right I really appreciate you can see
[51:42] the how the song is the prayer it's it's
[51:45] amazing to see and it just brings such
[51:46] confidence
[51:48] knowing that you're in the will of God
[51:49] when you see things line up like that
[51:52] so even the stories and The Parables he
[51:54] talks about
[51:55] to the thoughts mentioned in the opening
[51:57] and closing prayers and sometimes the
[51:59] detail that seems out of place or
[52:01] insignificant is the very little detail
[52:04] that holds the whole truth back for from
[52:06] you or releases it to you
[52:09] but you can only for you can only fully
[52:11] see those things in the time of its
[52:13] possession
[52:15] continually opening itself you'll read
[52:17] it and you'll get something from it and
[52:19] then you'll get a revelation so and you
[52:21] go back and read it and it just keeps
[52:22] opening up opening up it's by the
[52:25] washing of the word but it's for the
[52:26] perfecting of your faith
[52:28] right he said he was hitting the tops
[52:31] the high places uh the high spots he
[52:34] said he was storing up food and he
[52:36] encouraged us to drill down into them so
[52:38] that's what I'm saying when you're
[52:39] reading a message at least that's how it
[52:41] falls upon me and my heart is to look up
[52:44] when he mentions a scripture to go look
[52:46] it up and sometimes I find it really
[52:48] really helps support the rest of the
[52:50] message you didn't have time to do it
[52:52] but he said he was just hitting the high
[52:54] points and he said drill down into it
[52:57] one of the simplest lessons of the
[52:58] revealed work is attitude and sincerity
[53:02] he said you cannot receive the full
[53:03] purpose and the full fullness of the
[53:06] message if you approach him as a novel
[53:08] or a newspaper and we're all guilty of
[53:10] it there is a blessing in that too
[53:11] sometimes I'm driving in my car and I'll
[53:14] put on the message and just as
[53:16] background music it's okay to do that
[53:18] but there's also a part of your life
[53:20] where you really need to seek God in the
[53:23] message
[53:25] said uh don't read them as a newspaper
[53:28] or diligently seek him within the pages
[53:30] it's an eternal word ever unfolding the
[53:33] letter still kills but the spirit still
[53:35] gives life
[53:36] but it's only to those that are
[53:37] procrastinated to see it truly and holy
[53:40] so as we go into the invisible Union
[53:42] I've
[53:44] Looking Back Now at the title of it
[53:46] after studying it and show seeing what
[53:47] God showed me there's three things in
[53:50] the title
[53:52] that he talks about and it's about the
[53:54] bride of Christ the Union
[53:56] and the invisible part
[53:59] so the bride if we
[54:01] we sometimes we think we know what
[54:03] certain things are but just as looking
[54:05] into them then some knowledge comes out
[54:08] about it
[54:09] says a bride is a is a woman that's just
[54:12] married or about to be married a woman
[54:14] types the church and vice versa
[54:17] that if we break down the word Christ it
[54:19] says the anointed word he's the word in
[54:21] season the illuminated word
[54:23] and then the union part is an act or
[54:26] instance of uniting or joining two or
[54:28] more things into one
[54:30] it's a uniting in marriage
[54:32] it's the growing together of severed
[54:35] Parts it's a unified condition
[54:37] combination or Junction
[54:40] a gracious Union of excellence and
[54:42] strength
[54:44] or something that is made one
[54:48] so when I think of that right away my
[54:50] heart goes to until we all come to the
[54:52] unity of the faith
[54:53] and the unity of the body members
[54:56] together but then also them to him so
[54:58] it's a marriage of the family of God
[55:02] and then we look at invisible it says
[55:04] and something that's invisible is
[55:07] incapable
[55:08] by nature of being seen not perceptible
[55:12] by vision
[55:13] inaccessible to view or hidden
[55:17] not marked by outward signs not openly
[55:20] acknowledged or made known
[55:22] not able to be recognized or identified
[55:26] and then my favorite it's of which of
[55:29] such small size or unobtrusive quality
[55:32] as to be hardly noticed
[55:35] inconspicuous
[55:37] not noticed or acknowledged treated as
[55:39] if invisible
[55:41] overlooked
[55:42] so the Unseen part there's a part there
[55:46] where it'll actually be recognized by
[55:47] some but is saying that it's
[55:48] unrecognized my question is why would it
[55:51] be unrecognized who's it on recognized
[55:53] by what why is it that they can't
[55:55] recognize it
[55:57] and then the thing about that comes to
[55:58] me is like if our gospel be hid it'll
[56:00] hit from them that are lost or laid to
[56:03] see as blind naked and don't know it or
[56:06] as we know the Jews were blinded so the
[56:08] gospel can come to us and now layer to
[56:11] see a blindness so the gospel can be
[56:12] returned back to the Jews these are all
[56:15] the things that
[56:16] I see laying in just the title but
[56:19] that's from after studying a message
[56:22] it's fair to say that the message could
[56:25] be titled and I'm not changing the title
[56:27] of it but just sometimes to hear things
[56:29] in a little different way it's the
[56:31] unrecognized marriage of the bride of
[56:33] Christ
[56:34] or the second coming of Christ in Bride
[56:37] form
[56:37] the invisible Union of the bride of
[56:39] Christ
[56:41] so Christ's coming they're always
[56:42] different than what any believer
[56:44] priests or Scholars thoughts that they
[56:47] will be we know that every time he comes
[56:49] he comes totally different than what our
[56:52] own intellect our own ideas think he
[56:55] would come
[56:56] is first coming when it transitioned
[56:58] from grace to law law to Grace they were
[57:01] singing about his coming we know that
[57:03] the prophet told us young women were
[57:05] praying that they would be the vessel
[57:06] that carried carried them
[57:09] they were quoting the very scriptures
[57:11] and the prophecies about him
[57:13] and yet they completely missed him
[57:16] he's standing in their midst
[57:18] they missed the Fulfillment of the
[57:20] prophecy how
[57:23] the prophet told us that there's a
[57:25] spiritual and carnal believer and he
[57:28] says that a carnal believer he goes he
[57:30] always sees what God has done they look
[57:32] backwards
[57:34] he said they can feel the pull of the
[57:36] hour
[57:37] but they can't fully accept the promise
[57:39] of the hour
[57:40] he goes but their hope
[57:42] mentally partially accept the word but
[57:45] their hope blinds them into missing it
[57:47] the very fulfillment looking for the
[57:49] manifestation down the road so you're
[57:51] either looking back or looking forward
[57:52] and missing what God is doing
[57:57] it says that hope
[57:59] the nature of Hope is in confidence it
[58:02] always looks forward
[58:03] but hope has to manifest into faith
[58:07] so if we I want to start into invisible
[58:09] Union it's a paragraph 23 and this is
[58:13] just where he reads the scriptural texts
[58:15] you can turn there if you want it's
[58:17] Romans 7 1-6 or I could just read it
[58:21] he says no ye not brethren for I speak
[58:23] to them that know the law
[58:26] how that the law hath dominion over a
[58:28] man as long as he liveth
[58:31] for the woman which half and husband is
[58:34] bound by the law to her husband so as
[58:36] long as he liveth but if the husband be
[58:39] dead she is loosed from the law
[58:41] and of her husband
[58:43] so then if while her husband liveth
[58:46] she be married to another man she shall
[58:48] be called an adulteress but if her
[58:50] husband be dead
[58:52] she is free from that law so that she is
[58:55] no adulteress
[58:57] though she be married to another man
[59:00] wherefore my brother and he also are
[59:03] become dead to the law by the body of
[59:05] Christ
[59:06] that ye should be married to another
[59:08] even to him who is raised from the dead
[59:11] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[59:13] God
[59:14] for when we were in the flesh the
[59:16] Motions of sins which for by the law did
[59:19] work in our members to bring forth fruit
[59:21] unto death
[59:23] and then verse 6
[59:26] but now we are delivered from the law
[59:28] that being dead wherein we were held
[59:31] that we should serve in newness of
[59:35] spirit and not in the oldness of the
[59:37] letter
[59:41] just a few things in this though I mean
[59:44] for me the main thing is verse six uh
[59:47] we'll talk I'll get to the quotes where
[59:49] brother Branham talks about this and the
[59:51] how it's kind of surprising that he
[59:54] chose this text
[59:56] but the big thing here is newness of
[59:58] spirit
[59:58] so newness can be as a compound meaning
[1:00:02] it's a it's rooted in time and class but
[1:00:05] it a newness and meaning of time it's
[1:00:07] the state of being Revel relatively
[1:00:11] new or recent with the inclination of
[1:00:14] being appropriately contemporary which
[1:00:16] is modern or currently just saying it's
[1:00:18] new in the time uh frame and then the
[1:00:21] other com meaning of it is in class it's
[1:00:23] the state of being new and different
[1:00:25] with the implication of being Superior
[1:00:28] and then he the next word is uh spirit
[1:00:31] or mind and the root meaning of that is
[1:00:34] actually inner being
[1:00:36] and then it's the non-material
[1:00:38] psychological which we know as the soul
[1:00:41] faculty which is potentially sensitive
[1:00:44] and responsive to God as an expression
[1:00:46] of the Divine and contrasts to the
[1:00:48] purely human so he's talking about the
[1:00:51] oldness of the letter versus the newness
[1:00:54] of the spirit or change of your mind
[1:00:55] it's also it talks about the way of
[1:00:58] thinking it's an attitude or disposition
[1:01:00] reflecting the way in which a person
[1:01:02] thinks about or deals with a certain
[1:01:04] matter
[1:01:06] in other words disposition attitude
[1:01:08] point of view frame of mind or way of
[1:01:10] thinking
[1:01:11] and then he goes into paragraphs 34 24
[1:01:14] to 34 and he just starts talking about
[1:01:16] the Golden Age
[1:01:18] he said if God asks them to preach at
[1:01:20] any age he would choose this age he said
[1:01:22] it's actually greater than his first
[1:01:23] coming
[1:01:25] he then he talks about Dwight Moody when
[1:01:27] he read Dwight Moody read this and he in
[1:01:29] Chicago and he ran out in the streets
[1:01:31] and he's like do you know Grace do you
[1:01:33] know Grace you're like Grace who he's
[1:01:35] like Miss Grace so he talks about that
[1:01:38] he was just finding his footing settling
[1:01:39] his spirit and then he goes into
[1:01:41] paragraph 35. he says Paul here is
[1:01:45] giving an illustration in the scripture
[1:01:46] about the law and Grace and illustrating
[1:01:49] like marriage and divorce this passage
[1:01:52] is very seldom preached on because it's
[1:01:55] more or less pertains to like marriage
[1:01:57] and divorce but
[1:01:59] it also pertains to a greater portion of
[1:02:02] marriage and divorce of how that he's
[1:02:04] trying to set an order here that we as a
[1:02:08] church can no more be married to the
[1:02:10] world
[1:02:11] and to Christ at the same time and to be
[1:02:14] legal and lawful about it so he's
[1:02:17] worried about the legal and lawful part
[1:02:19] of it then it can be for a woman to be
[1:02:22] living with a husband while she's got a
[1:02:24] living husband
[1:02:25] and she says I have my own thoughts on
[1:02:27] that and I believe that the Bible says
[1:02:29] it's truth and of course he he the Bible
[1:02:31] says that for a woman divorced her
[1:02:34] husband he has to be dead that's
[1:02:36] divorcement there is no other way uh but
[1:02:39] now he goes but I believe also it is to
[1:02:41] my belief that it unfolds one of the
[1:02:45] great mysteries of Prophecy
[1:02:48] I went back and I looked at him like I
[1:02:50] don't see it Lord open my eyes I I don't
[1:02:52] see it but he says it unfolds one of the
[1:02:55] great mysteries of Prophecy so now he's
[1:02:58] getting our attention and really and
[1:03:01] we'll get he gets into it but I'll just
[1:03:03] kind of let the cat of the bag now it's
[1:03:04] actually about double-mindedness but
[1:03:07] when God turns a corner
[1:03:09] there's an overlapping of the Aegis and
[1:03:12] the understanding of one age or when the
[1:03:14] prophecy comes to pass there's the new
[1:03:16] understanding Enlightenment further and
[1:03:18] there's the old and now you're in that
[1:03:21] overlap period you had to either stick
[1:03:23] with the old or move forward in the word
[1:03:25] it's a he actually talks about it as a
[1:03:28] double-mindedness
[1:03:31] so he said I looked up prophecy prophecy
[1:03:34] if you want to just take the just the
[1:03:36] standard form of it it's prophecy is the
[1:03:38] inspired declaration Divine will and
[1:03:40] purpose so he said it's a mystery of
[1:03:42] Prophecy
[1:03:44] so here in paragraph 40 he says may I
[1:03:47] had add to this woman Grace
[1:03:49] may I place her in the Bible that's
[1:03:52] called the lady elect Miss Grace and he
[1:03:55] used the Miss m-i-s-s which he's
[1:03:57] referring to an on married woman up to
[1:03:59] the age of 30. he goes that's who I'm
[1:04:02] going to talk about the Bible declares
[1:04:03] said that to the lady elect if you
[1:04:06] notice elect come from the word elected
[1:04:08] lady one lady amongst all other ladies
[1:04:11] was elected so he's saying chosen I
[1:04:16] never truly understood election the way
[1:04:17] I should
[1:04:18] but election just simply means selected
[1:04:20] you were selected by God
[1:04:22] when before the foundation of the world
[1:04:24] he knew
[1:04:26] whether you would receive them and
[1:04:27] accept them or not
[1:04:29] and when I read that right away my heart
[1:04:31] goes back to the sudden secret going
[1:04:33] away of the price where she had all of
[1:04:35] her cousins and they thought they were
[1:04:37] going to get the big Rancher but there
[1:04:39] was a quality in her
[1:04:41] that he was looking for
[1:04:43] then he goes on in paragraph 41 like the
[1:04:46] Virgin was to bring forth the body of
[1:04:49] God on the earth she wasn't an elected
[1:04:51] woman God chose Mary so he's just
[1:04:53] showing election means chosen
[1:04:56] and so God has chosen an elected lady
[1:04:59] which is his bride she's elected I hope
[1:05:02] we're members of that tonight across the
[1:05:04] world Across the Nation so this was a
[1:05:06] part of the series where he was actually
[1:05:07] hooked up and he was preaching uh
[1:05:09] Vancouver all across he was very many
[1:05:12] few places would actually opened their
[1:05:13] doors to him at this point so he would
[1:05:15] get on and actually have to do broadcast
[1:05:17] over the radio to try and get the
[1:05:19] message out
[1:05:21] so then he goes on and he goes into 43
[1:05:25] and this is where I've read right over
[1:05:28] the top of this so many times
[1:05:30] but he says the illustration here
[1:05:33] showing the relationship of the bride of
[1:05:35] Christ
[1:05:37] the elect lady and how she was to be
[1:05:39] brought to him where she would come from
[1:05:42] and how that she would be brought to him
[1:05:45] The church here is an illustration we've
[1:05:46] gotten view was illustrated by a woman
[1:05:48] which a woman is always the type of the
[1:05:50] church
[1:05:51] because the church is considered a bride
[1:05:53] a bride she is the Bride of the Lord
[1:05:55] Jesus Christ the son of God but when you
[1:05:57] first read that he actually mentioned
[1:05:59] four phenomenal things he said he was
[1:06:02] going to show the relationship
[1:06:05] of the Bride to Christ
[1:06:07] he said he was going to show how she was
[1:06:11] to be brought to him
[1:06:12] where she would come from and how that
[1:06:15] she would be brought to him
[1:06:17] so there was a time when he was to be
[1:06:19] brought something happened and then it
[1:06:21] was going to happen again
[1:06:23] so this message addresses all four of
[1:06:25] these questions or points kind of
[1:06:27] reminds me of the three big questions
[1:06:30] you know Where'd I come from where what
[1:06:31] am I doing here where am I going it's
[1:06:33] the same thing
[1:06:36] though I'm a student of the message for
[1:06:38] years I read over the top of points like
[1:06:40] this but the Holy Spirit lately draws my
[1:06:42] attention to the smallest of details
[1:06:45] so now he drops right into paragraph 49
[1:06:48] and he says but watch when the spiritual
[1:06:53] bride when she begins to have a Revival
[1:06:56] when she begins to come back and line
[1:06:59] herself up with the word of God watch
[1:07:02] then again you see
[1:07:04] how that the scriptures at that time
[1:07:07] there will be a message sweep out to
[1:07:09] catch that bride to catch that woman
[1:07:11] elect
[1:07:12] now we have a prophecy
[1:07:14] this he says three times he said when
[1:07:16] when when when when this happens
[1:07:19] the whole point he said of this is that
[1:07:21] he's going to reveal the mystery of
[1:07:23] Prophecy and right
[1:07:25] when you read the message very seldom is
[1:07:27] the brother Brown hit the point so hard
[1:07:28] first and then dropped back so this kind
[1:07:30] of when I saw it it struck me as odd I'm
[1:07:33] like wow that seems like the mean of the
[1:07:35] message why is he doing that so early
[1:07:37] but what it is he's giving the prophecy
[1:07:40] and then he's going to show an obstacle
[1:07:41] you have to overcome to get to the fruit
[1:07:43] or the reward of it right here he said
[1:07:47] you'd get a Revival
[1:07:49] but she has to begin to come back and
[1:07:51] line herself up with the word so there
[1:07:54] had to be a falling away
[1:07:56] there had to be and we're all identified
[1:07:58] in that you could have been in the
[1:07:59] message your whole life just came we're
[1:08:01] all represented represent in this
[1:08:03] prophecy the prophecy said that we had
[1:08:05] to come back and line up with the word
[1:08:07] you might say well I haven't done
[1:08:08] anything
[1:08:09] the prophet said we have
[1:08:11] we can only take it
[1:08:13] right so there is two parts to it
[1:08:15] there's a promised Revival but you have
[1:08:18] to recognize that you're at a step and
[1:08:19] you have to come back and line yourself
[1:08:21] up with the word
[1:08:22] so now he's going to go in and talk more
[1:08:25] about that I apologize that this format
[1:08:27] is not too you're used to but this is
[1:08:29] how the word of the Lord works on me
[1:08:32] and I'm just getting used to
[1:08:34] being doing this format so I apologize
[1:08:37] if I'm not making as much eye contact
[1:08:40] but maybe as we go on it's in my heart
[1:08:42] but I just want to make sure I hit the
[1:08:43] points okay
[1:08:45] so he promised a Revival a Revival means
[1:08:48] to revive
[1:08:49] make a live Quicken but he said this
[1:08:51] time without sensation he said he'd
[1:08:53] bring it to life
[1:08:55] so prophetic it's a this is post-profit
[1:08:58] and right when I read this my heart goes
[1:09:00] to the preview of the Bride he had that
[1:09:01] vision and he's like get back in line
[1:09:04] and when he wakes up but he's still
[1:09:06] calling that out in the room get back in
[1:09:07] line
[1:09:08] right there's no self-righteousness here
[1:09:10] there's no white at walls the bride got
[1:09:12] it a step and we're all represented
[1:09:14] there remember the Rich Young Ruler the
[1:09:17] last lesson our Prophet taught us in
[1:09:18] leadership he said he kept all the
[1:09:20] letter of the word but he said one thing
[1:09:22] thou lack us
[1:09:28] Supernatural element that he promised it
[1:09:31] was lacking it's true it brings true
[1:09:33] leadership what it is that he didn't
[1:09:35] have representation or election even
[1:09:38] though he kept all the words he still
[1:09:41] didn't have representation
[1:09:43] earlier we read that
[1:09:45] my sheep hear my voice and I know them
[1:09:49] there's a time when God reaches out and
[1:09:52] he shows that he knows you but then
[1:09:53] there's others that'll come Lord have
[1:09:54] not done this have not done he's like
[1:09:55] depart from me you workers I don't know
[1:09:58] you
[1:09:59] so we want to be sure that
[1:10:01] he knows us
[1:10:03] and he will reveal to you it's by
[1:10:05] election whether or not you're of his
[1:10:08] there comes a time when the fruit is
[1:10:10] hanging there before us and when we say
[1:10:12] we'll know them by their fruit so many
[1:10:14] times we all know that one no it's more
[1:10:16] about you knowing yourself
[1:10:19] all right
[1:10:21] amen
[1:10:25] in that same message in leadership I've
[1:10:27] read it so many times but I didn't get
[1:10:29] it
[1:10:30] but then he went to the poor old
[1:10:32] hillbilly
[1:10:33] it was a contrast it didn't seem like it
[1:10:36] was important it just seemed like a
[1:10:37] little story
[1:10:38] but it's actually the very context of
[1:10:40] what he was trying to explain
[1:10:42] the little hillbilly who never wanted
[1:10:44] anything to do with organized religion
[1:10:47] but he wanted to meet God and he wanted
[1:10:49] to talk to William Branham
[1:10:51] and when you start to understand and
[1:10:53] think about all the circumstances of how
[1:10:55] God sent that Prophet to him they went
[1:10:57] to a place for three days couldn't find
[1:10:58] a squirrel
[1:11:00] place where they're always squirrels why
[1:11:03] there was a woman on the hill his
[1:11:05] neighbor had cancer got healed from it
[1:11:06] it created the he had a desire in his
[1:11:08] heart
[1:11:10] and God sent him that prophet and he led
[1:11:13] them to the Lord
[1:11:16] this idea
[1:11:18] of the Revival aligning with the word he
[1:11:21] reinforces it now in paragraph 54.
[1:11:24] because now but you notice when the
[1:11:26] people
[1:11:27] when they begin to try
[1:11:30] to line up with the word there comes a
[1:11:32] fresh message
[1:11:33] from the word of God right straight to
[1:11:36] the people
[1:11:37] and they catch that message
[1:11:39] and they line up
[1:11:40] every time there's a guarantee in that
[1:11:43] brother
[1:11:44] there's a guarantee
[1:11:47] every time but notice he didn't say a
[1:11:50] word came to a prophet the city came
[1:11:51] straight to the people this time we're
[1:11:53] talking about a prophecy for the bride
[1:11:55] for a Revival
[1:11:58] I've been persuaded by the message of
[1:12:00] the hour I've embraced my birth weight
[1:12:01] I'm a prisoner of love I'm a prisoner to
[1:12:03] election
[1:12:04] I can't do no other neither can you
[1:12:07] there's a reason why you do what you do
[1:12:09] and while you love them the way you do
[1:12:12] you're either a prisoner of Christ or of
[1:12:13] antichrist
[1:12:15] that's where we're at it's the Seal of
[1:12:16] God or the mark of the beast
[1:12:19] and he said only one word off separates
[1:12:21] the two
[1:12:23] you we can't do that
[1:12:25] I can't live this word according to that
[1:12:29] for something in me CAM and you just
[1:12:31] have to surrender to it
[1:12:33] the Holy Spirit holds the bride on that
[1:12:35] Razor's Edge
[1:12:37] he said in hearing recognizing and
[1:12:39] acting down the word of God he said it's
[1:12:40] 100th millionth of a hair
[1:12:43] that's the fine lie
[1:12:47] the one word off
[1:12:51] in that message even though he doesn't
[1:12:53] clearly come out and say it but the
[1:12:56] whole point of that message is he's
[1:12:57] talking about
[1:12:59] third pool manifestation versus apostasy
[1:13:02] and that's that Razor's Edge
[1:13:04] because that's one of the truths of the
[1:13:06] message
[1:13:06] it's a call to line up or fall back I
[1:13:09] said get in Step it's it's get in
[1:13:11] Harmony When You Look up the word
[1:13:13] apostasy I look up a lot of words
[1:13:15] English was never ever my strong suit I
[1:13:17] come to find that I get a lot of
[1:13:18] blessing in looking up taking what
[1:13:21] Webster didn't say but with the
[1:13:23] understanding of the message
[1:13:25] right not just taking what they said but
[1:13:27] just seeing the glory of the Lord in it
[1:13:31] so he said apostasy is an act of
[1:13:34] refusing to continue to follow obey or
[1:13:37] recognize
[1:13:40] he said it's an abandonment abandonment
[1:13:42] of a previous loyalty or defection
[1:13:46] he said there have come a great Falling
[1:13:48] Away first he's prophesied or said that
[1:13:50] he would send strong delusion to for all
[1:13:52] to believe the great lie he said that
[1:13:55] they were naked blind and don't know it
[1:13:57] but on the other side of that we have
[1:13:59] the third pull which is recognition
[1:14:02] third pull is true leadership it's
[1:14:04] headship it's Oneness it's deity veiled
[1:14:07] in flesh it's a great paradox
[1:14:10] it's Harmony remember pick up your pen
[1:14:12] and write this harmony is now to exist
[1:14:18] the perfecting of our faith isn't
[1:14:20] resting in our ability to keep his word
[1:14:23] it's laying in his ability to keep his
[1:14:25] own word in US
[1:14:28] he never fails it's Grace and election
[1:14:31] that's true rest and peace my brother
[1:14:33] that's the shalom
[1:14:36] I could never live this message can you
[1:14:39] imagine even the days where I thought
[1:14:41] that I had a good day brother Brown said
[1:14:43] I sinned a thousand times
[1:14:46] it goes beyond this mental intellect
[1:14:50] but I take it and I accept it because he
[1:14:52] told us it was so I accepted as truth
[1:14:55] it's not in our I'm so thankful it's not
[1:14:57] in my ability to keep this word
[1:15:00] and it has nothing to do with this flesh
[1:15:02] it has to do with
[1:15:04] Gina God election and whether it's there
[1:15:07] or not
[1:15:08] so I wrote down a few questions and
[1:15:10] these were questions I asked myself can
[1:15:12] you surrender your will to him
[1:15:14] completely trust and rely on him
[1:15:17] pure confidence in the Living Word
[1:15:20] if you can that's the election on
[1:15:22] display
[1:15:24] and it's concerning the word when the
[1:15:26] word of Correction comes forth can you
[1:15:29] receive it can you take it can you let
[1:15:31] it move in your being can you line up to
[1:15:33] it
[1:15:34] that's what it is
[1:15:36] we stumble around in the flesh is not
[1:15:38] giving you if you never would if you're
[1:15:39] a bride of Christ
[1:15:40] you would never do anything to try and
[1:15:43] bring shame against them but you're in
[1:15:45] this flesh and you stumble around but
[1:15:47] right away you say Lord forgive me
[1:15:49] and actually the prophet in ways told us
[1:15:52] he's like what are you talking about he
[1:15:54] doesn't even know it's already cast in
[1:15:55] the sea and we'll get into that in the
[1:15:57] later part of being justified
[1:15:59] but you do it because there's a sincere
[1:16:01] desire in your heart to be right and and
[1:16:03] to repent
[1:16:05] but it's already as soon as you do it
[1:16:06] even if you just think it in your heart
[1:16:08] that is the third pull you don't even
[1:16:10] have to speak it this is what you think
[1:16:11] in your heart
[1:16:13] foreign
[1:16:15] the veil to the holiest of holies the
[1:16:18] soul of the very elect is where God
[1:16:19] resides I know we always want to talk
[1:16:21] about the Tabernacle that was a type and
[1:16:23] a shadow of the true purpose of God
[1:16:25] it was to live in in his sons and
[1:16:28] daughters in their heart and he told us
[1:16:31] that the veil to the holiest of holies
[1:16:33] is actually self-will
[1:16:35] that's why we have the diet to ourselves
[1:16:39] not my will thy be done Lord
[1:16:41] right
[1:16:42] Paul said I Die daily
[1:16:44] you might live
[1:16:46] right the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:16:48] was a type it was a shadow of the
[1:16:49] purpose of God
[1:16:50] so then I married vows you know the
[1:16:53] husband vows the love and honor his wife
[1:16:55] and the wife vows to love honor and obey
[1:16:57] her husband
[1:16:59] I'm gonna Bear My Soul a little bit here
[1:17:01] now
[1:17:02] uh I'm gonna do a confession I must
[1:17:05] confess that everything I ever thought
[1:17:07] concerning their word at the hour up
[1:17:09] until I was truly born again
[1:17:11] and received Christ's headship which was
[1:17:14] roughly three years ago I was an heir
[1:17:19] I had the knowledge of the message the
[1:17:22] knowledge of him mixed up with
[1:17:23] Pentecostal ideas
[1:17:25] old traditions my own private
[1:17:28] interpretations and those of my parents
[1:17:31] or my elders and their hopes and my
[1:17:33] hopes guesses and maybe Souls at best
[1:17:36] was at least one word off
[1:17:39] and if a little eleven eleventh the
[1:17:42] whole lump
[1:17:42] it can't
[1:17:45] if you're one word off
[1:17:47] it doesn't matter that's why the Holy
[1:17:50] Ghost is here to hold us on that Razor's
[1:17:51] Edge
[1:17:54] if we have to be lined up with the word
[1:17:56] then there has to be something come to
[1:17:58] line up too
[1:18:01] if we can't back up what we're saying or
[1:18:03] doing by the word of the hour stop
[1:18:07] line up get back in step
[1:18:09] our thoughts and opinions are worthless
[1:18:12] and won't stand
[1:18:14] if anything you'll be a stumbling block
[1:18:16] to yourself and to those around you
[1:18:20] excuse me
[1:18:23] we're not talking about legalism
[1:18:25] we're talking about the word live out
[1:18:26] through you
[1:18:28] but in his grace and because of election
[1:18:30] and his name's sake he sought me out
[1:18:32] found me in extended Mercy to me and I
[1:18:34] accepted it
[1:18:35] every correction I've take taken with a
[1:18:38] thankful heart
[1:18:39] it's glorious to be to be corrected by
[1:18:42] the word
[1:18:44] it's true praise and worship
[1:18:46] that he cares enough for you to correct
[1:18:48] you and we know that's true love
[1:18:51] it's pretty easy to let someone just do
[1:18:53] whatever they want because he doesn't
[1:18:55] have to make a stand for anything
[1:18:58] but true love is correction
[1:19:02] We Are The Most Blessed age that ever
[1:19:04] lived we're in the Golden Age The
[1:19:06] Astronaut Age The Eagle age and these
[1:19:07] are not just the words that this is
[1:19:10] it's real it's reality it's not just
[1:19:12] little things that catch people's
[1:19:14] attention not buzzwords
[1:19:16] I'll share this with you every Bible
[1:19:19] question I've asked him with a sincere
[1:19:21] heart and a pure desire to know him and
[1:19:24] serve him better he is Faithfully
[1:19:26] answered
[1:19:28] he answers my questions in private study
[1:19:31] and prayer a thought that comes
[1:19:34] to mine and runs through the entire
[1:19:36] message and Bible it comes over the
[1:19:39] pulpit comes through fellowship with
[1:19:41] those of precious like faith
[1:19:43] it always comes by the message of the
[1:19:45] hour from them
[1:19:47] I encourage you if you have a Bible
[1:19:49] question something that you've never
[1:19:50] truly understand if your heart is Right
[1:19:52] ask him and see if he doesn't answer
[1:19:54] it's the time for it
[1:19:56] you just have to diligently seek him in
[1:19:58] the word it's not just going to
[1:19:59] magically come into the air you have to
[1:20:01] put your foot forward it's laying within
[1:20:03] the message
[1:20:06] that is the greatest blessing right now
[1:20:08] having the correct understanding of the
[1:20:10] word of the hour
[1:20:11] without it you have iniquity
[1:20:14] wrong thinking concerning him
[1:20:19] you can't take this word and handle it
[1:20:20] with your own thoughts of intellect or
[1:20:23] emotions it will bear the wrong fruit
[1:20:27] paragraph 59 to 61 he actually starts
[1:20:31] talking about the father's genes
[1:20:33] uh paragraph 61 he says and therefore
[1:20:36] assures the gene had to be in your
[1:20:38] father before for your natural birth
[1:20:40] your spiritual Gene had to be in God
[1:20:44] foreign
[1:20:45] because you're an expression of the
[1:20:47] attributes of his thoughts before the
[1:20:49] foundation of the world
[1:20:50] right no way around it that's right
[1:20:54] now we notice then that life being in
[1:20:56] you God's life being in you from the
[1:21:00] foundation of the world so he's talking
[1:21:01] about an election
[1:21:02] right in the beginning was the word the
[1:21:04] Word was God the words with God
[1:21:06] then he goes to paragraph 79-92 he's
[1:21:10] just talking about the woman being in
[1:21:11] the betting ground right 92 he says no
[1:21:14] this is committed to her her sacred
[1:21:16] virtue sacred Womanhood sacred
[1:21:18] motherhood is to honor her husband so
[1:21:20] she honors all three but he's building
[1:21:22] up
[1:21:23] trying to explain and show about the
[1:21:26] invisible Union talking about how it has
[1:21:28] to be birthed
[1:21:29] right
[1:21:31] she honors her husband by all three
[1:21:34] and now he from 93 to 157 he's
[1:21:38] he's talking about Hollywood and TV and
[1:21:40] how they've tricked women into not
[1:21:43] honoring these three virtues and how the
[1:21:45] church by false teachers and that were
[1:21:47] tricked away but then he says in 157 the
[1:21:51] seed of God is operating through you
[1:21:53] that's the word of God
[1:21:56] the love of the world can't be in there
[1:21:57] at the same time it's not the written
[1:22:00] word the revealed word now he's talking
[1:22:02] about a Living Word
[1:22:04] right and that's what it's always been
[1:22:06] about what came first it was actually it
[1:22:08] was always meant to be the Living Word
[1:22:11] let's see scene of John God operating
[1:22:14] through you that's the manifested Living
[1:22:16] Word of the Day living Epistles right he
[1:22:18] reinforces it in paragraph 160 he says
[1:22:21] and the Revelation is the only thing the
[1:22:24] revelation of the word what is the what
[1:22:27] is a revelation Jesus said Upon This
[1:22:29] Rock I'll build my church and the gates
[1:22:31] of hell can't Prevail against it faith
[1:22:33] is a revelation because faith has been
[1:22:36] revealed
[1:22:37] to you
[1:22:40] we could read right over that
[1:22:42] was a pretty phenomenal statement it's
[1:22:44] not about recognizing the prophet or
[1:22:46] anything else but
[1:22:48] When Faith is revealed to you when you
[1:22:51] truly see yourself in the word he's
[1:22:53] talking about
[1:22:54] and when that happens
[1:22:56] nothing nothing can shake you
[1:23:00] know
[1:23:01] see it's not God said a Prophet this is
[1:23:03] no longer the safe haven no longer the
[1:23:06] standard the word has to be revealed to
[1:23:08] you who are you
[1:23:11] and when you go to acting on that word
[1:23:14] of Revelation Faith that's the word of
[1:23:16] God not written not revealed it's a
[1:23:19] living word right it's a personal
[1:23:21] experience personal relationship not
[1:23:23] wishful thinking or living off of past
[1:23:26] manifestation it's your positional
[1:23:28] placement you truly see yourself in the
[1:23:31] word
[1:23:34] the faith of the hour is revealed to you
[1:23:36] because it's who your very self
[1:23:39] your inner being
[1:23:42] he warned us and warned us about looking
[1:23:43] back at past manifestations and looking
[1:23:46] ahead
[1:23:47] he said don't do it you always got to
[1:23:49] believe and understand that he is and
[1:23:51] look for the I am
[1:23:54] what we're talking about he's talking
[1:23:55] about the union the marriage the second
[1:23:56] coming of Christ and the body of
[1:23:58] Believers the very purpose of Malachi 4
[1:24:00] to turn the hearts of the children back
[1:24:02] to the apostolical faith of the fathers
[1:24:05] he sent the prophet with the perfect
[1:24:06] word which is his grace to us because of
[1:24:09] election Because of Who We Are
[1:24:11] if you've received the message of the
[1:24:13] hour Christ in Bride form the final
[1:24:16] manifestation to the Gentiles before
[1:24:18] returning back to his Jew and his
[1:24:19] Brethren the final voice to the final
[1:24:21] age
[1:24:22] right that doesn't diminish
[1:24:25] the past manifestation it was to produce
[1:24:27] this it was the whole purpose that it
[1:24:29] happened the mature Brian manifestation
[1:24:31] is the final Vindication of the
[1:24:33] prophet's prophecy
[1:24:35] the prophecy has to come to pass the
[1:24:38] manifestation of the family of God
[1:24:40] he was the wave Chief the evidence of
[1:24:43] more to come in the Harvest he was the
[1:24:45] first fruits first to mature we know
[1:24:47] that that's what the message teaches but
[1:24:48] let it get into your heart into your
[1:24:50] soul
[1:24:51] it's amazing that he goes from that and
[1:24:54] he goes right and this is one of my
[1:24:56] favorite scriptures sir we all have
[1:24:58] those certain scriptures that just
[1:24:59] resonate with us
[1:25:01] but in 161 he says Abel by faith offered
[1:25:05] by Revelation he says faith offered to
[1:25:08] God a more excellent sacrifice than that
[1:25:10] of Cain
[1:25:12] he's quoting Hebrews 11 4
[1:25:14] faith is a revelation
[1:25:16] it goes back to Genesis beginning of
[1:25:19] twins the spiritual and the colonel
[1:25:21] if we go back and this is what I'm
[1:25:23] talking about where he said he's hitting
[1:25:24] the high points and when he referenced
[1:25:26] something he it's in my heart I go back
[1:25:28] and I start reading the scriptures there
[1:25:30] to see what lay there and that's what he
[1:25:32] actually he asked us to do
[1:25:34] uh so when I go back and uh
[1:25:37] I read I started at Hebrews 11 1 and he
[1:25:41] goes to now Faith is the substance of
[1:25:43] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[1:25:45] Not Seen
[1:25:46] but the question I ask is now what do
[1:25:49] you mean now when is now
[1:25:52] so
[1:25:53] upon research and the Holy Ghost where
[1:25:56] now is the appointed time of the father
[1:25:58] it's always the appointed time of the
[1:26:00] father
[1:26:01] in Psalms 105 19 it says until the time
[1:26:05] that his word came the word of the Lord
[1:26:07] tried him until
[1:26:09] the time of your word so that's the now
[1:26:11] it's always the now he says faith is the
[1:26:15] substance things hope for whatever it's
[1:26:17] you can overlap the mind he goes faith
[1:26:19] and so or substance and evidence is the
[1:26:21] exact same thing and hope and not seen
[1:26:23] are the exact same thing
[1:26:25] right so we have the uh faith is the
[1:26:29] substance the evidence it's the the
[1:26:30] nature of it it's the essence it's the
[1:26:32] real being it's the proof the reality
[1:26:34] that's what faith is it's not a hope so
[1:26:36] it's a it's actually the reality of the
[1:26:39] word
[1:26:40] and then hoped and not seen well that's
[1:26:42] invisible and unrecognized and that's
[1:26:44] why there's always a showdown between
[1:26:46] Hope and Faith it brings a showdown hope
[1:26:50] is always looking with confidence to
[1:26:53] that which is good and beneficial
[1:26:55] but it's always looking ahead looking
[1:26:57] looking that's the nature of Faith but
[1:27:00] faith
[1:27:01] pulls on the word and produces the
[1:27:04] manifestation of what was presented or
[1:27:07] what was prophesied
[1:27:09] or it rests on the promise
[1:27:12] so we have unbelief doubt looks back
[1:27:15] past fulfillment Faith recognize and
[1:27:17] declares that he is
[1:27:18] and hope looks forward to fulfillment
[1:27:21] at this time hope is our enemy you must
[1:27:23] push forward into your inheritance claim
[1:27:25] it and own it and let it Empower you
[1:27:28] God is searching for faith and when he
[1:27:31] finds it he Embraces it he fans its
[1:27:34] Embers increasing the measure unto
[1:27:35] perfection
[1:27:37] so now I go on I read on and I come to
[1:27:40] Hebrews 11 4 he says by faith Abel this
[1:27:43] is the one that he was talking about a
[1:27:45] more excellent
[1:27:46] which is just phenomenal when you think
[1:27:48] about it but he said he offered which
[1:27:50] means to present so he presented God a
[1:27:53] more appropriate or better or more
[1:27:54] acceptable sacrifice
[1:27:57] and he obtained a witness so when he
[1:27:59] obtained the witness he was he was
[1:28:01] actually sealed it's saying that he was
[1:28:03] sealed by his his testimony and all he
[1:28:06] did was but they both we know we heard
[1:28:08] the pastor talk about they both received
[1:28:10] the same message but out of that message
[1:28:13] one by Colonel thought it was the fruit
[1:28:16] and that religion is still going around
[1:28:18] in the world today and then we have can
[1:28:20] you imagine if we were back there which
[1:28:22] one would you choose here's a man over
[1:28:25] here with a rock beaten slashing open if
[1:28:28] you didn't have Revelation you would be
[1:28:30] like what's that guy doing he's crazy
[1:28:32] but when you line up with the word of
[1:28:34] God and take it always there's you seem
[1:28:36] crazy you do it's a lot of times you're
[1:28:38] the forebearer you're you're you're
[1:28:40] receiving something that still hasn't
[1:28:42] caught on if you want to say there's
[1:28:44] always those people of the pillar of it
[1:28:46] they see it first and then they start
[1:28:48] giving testimony of what they see and go
[1:28:51] and then it starts catching on to other
[1:28:53] people and they start seeing the same
[1:28:54] thing I'm not saying that's me I'm just
[1:28:56] saying that's the way God does things
[1:28:58] right
[1:29:02] so then he the next one I'm just going
[1:29:04] back this this is the thing about when
[1:29:06] you go back with the understanding of
[1:29:08] the message that you're reading and go
[1:29:09] back and read those scriptures those
[1:29:10] scriptures will open something up to you
[1:29:12] based out of that message truth that
[1:29:15] he's he's revealing right but he says
[1:29:17] without faith is impossible to please
[1:29:19] him for he that cometh of God must
[1:29:21] believe that he is so there we're seeing
[1:29:23] a faith you have to believe that he is
[1:29:25] and that he's rewarder of them that
[1:29:27] diligently seek him a lot of times we
[1:29:29] Overlook that part those that diligently
[1:29:31] seek him uh but there's a reward for
[1:29:34] that
[1:29:34] then Hebrews 11 13 he goes they all died
[1:29:38] in faith
[1:29:39] having not received the promises but
[1:29:41] have seen them far off and were
[1:29:43] persuaded of them embraced them and
[1:29:45] confessed that they were strangers and
[1:29:47] pilgrims
[1:29:48] so right there there's actually a recipe
[1:29:50] of how God reveals himself to
[1:29:52] individuals the word of God comes first
[1:29:54] it persuades you
[1:29:56] that he said brother Brown said it many
[1:29:58] times faith is a Persuader
[1:30:01] persuade you to look at this instead of
[1:30:03] this it's the beginning of faith and
[1:30:05] then you have to embrace that you have
[1:30:08] to become one with it you have to line
[1:30:10] up with it and then you have a
[1:30:12] confession of what God has revealed to
[1:30:14] you
[1:30:15] and based on that confession
[1:30:18] you go down to uh 11 16 he says now they
[1:30:22] desire a better country as a Heavenly
[1:30:23] where if God is not ashamed to be called
[1:30:25] their God
[1:30:27] see they had a testimony of that I don't
[1:30:29] belong here
[1:30:30] I'm an eternal being I want to go back
[1:30:32] there and they had the correct just like
[1:30:35] how do you write said the right thing
[1:30:36] their testimony was correct so God put a
[1:30:40] seal on them and said I'm not ashamed to
[1:30:42] be called their God and we know there's
[1:30:44] people that he can't put that seal on
[1:30:47] based on your confession of who you say
[1:30:49] he is
[1:30:51] the current manifestation in terms
[1:30:53] whether or not he's ashamed of you
[1:30:54] ashamed of you and your testimony or not
[1:30:56] whether or not you are his whether or
[1:30:58] not he receives your sacrifice your
[1:31:00] offering your worship and the mark that
[1:31:02] you receive it proves whether or not
[1:31:04] you're in harmony with him
[1:31:07] you're either sealed in or out by the
[1:31:08] Holy Ghost that's being born again the
[1:31:10] new birth you've received your
[1:31:12] identification the Union
[1:31:14] so this is my beloved Son my dwelling
[1:31:16] place here ye him and he said I am my
[1:31:19] father are one and he always asks who do
[1:31:21] you say I am
[1:31:24] can you see what makes you special what
[1:31:26] makes you do exactly what's pleasing in
[1:31:28] his sight
[1:31:29] you were predestinated to be here right
[1:31:32] now manifesting God in this age just
[1:31:34] like the Saints in the Bible
[1:31:36] you recognize your visitation
[1:31:39] you're born again a new creation called
[1:31:41] bride
[1:31:42] you've received your Birthright the eyes
[1:31:44] of your understanding be enlightened the
[1:31:47] Rapture and the change of your body the
[1:31:48] wedding supper the millennial rain
[1:31:50] Futurama those are all your birthrights
[1:31:52] rights of birth
[1:31:55] the only way
[1:31:58] you can see it as the very elect they
[1:32:00] have the fulfilled this portion of the
[1:32:01] word it's the bride word in you Christ
[1:32:03] the United word of the hour Christ in
[1:32:05] Bride form
[1:32:08] so then he goes into 163 and right back
[1:32:11] there he was he went back to Genesis and
[1:32:13] talked about Cain and Abel and how one
[1:32:15] had faith and then he goes into 163
[1:32:18] at the end time both trees are coming to
[1:32:20] the seed and proving themselves here we
[1:32:23] are right today laodicea and the bride
[1:32:26] just as clear and pretty as it can be in
[1:32:29] Scripture
[1:32:30] and right before your faces you can't
[1:32:33] serve God and Mammon you can't be a
[1:32:37] virtuous bible-believing Christian and
[1:32:40] Associate yourself in the denominational
[1:32:42] Affair you just can't do it at the same
[1:32:44] time one has got to be dead
[1:32:47] and the other one live
[1:32:49] this is actually a warning
[1:32:53] I always thought like Mammon it was but
[1:32:55] riches and stuff like that but actually
[1:32:56] if you read this carefully brother
[1:32:58] Branham just said that Mammon is
[1:33:01] denominational thinking
[1:33:04] intellectually reasoning with the word
[1:33:07] because he said laodicea Mammon
[1:33:09] denominational Affair he said bride
[1:33:13] serve God Bible believing Christian
[1:33:22] so Mammon he's calling denominational
[1:33:24] Affair Mammon denominational affairs he
[1:33:27] talked about serve and serve as to be
[1:33:29] controlled by
[1:33:31] you may not be in a denomination but you
[1:33:33] could be possessing a denominational
[1:33:34] Spirit reasoning with the word your own
[1:33:37] private interpretation
[1:33:39] early he talked about the newness of
[1:33:41] spirit and mind versus the old letter of
[1:33:44] the law
[1:33:45] I he showed me that
[1:33:48] some of my thinking wasn't correct to
[1:33:50] the message I took the message and it
[1:33:52] was just old things that were handed
[1:33:53] down
[1:33:55] that there was either taught in the
[1:33:57] message but it was old it was actually
[1:33:59] Pentecostal thoughts mixed with the
[1:34:02] message
[1:34:07] he says now let's take this is
[1:34:09] I'm glad I got to this point
[1:34:12] he gets he goes on and he's talking
[1:34:14] about he continues for from 60 164 to
[1:34:17] 170. he's talking about God versus
[1:34:18] Mammon denominational thinking and then
[1:34:21] he gets it it's very odd it almost seems
[1:34:23] out of place and he says now look
[1:34:25] take a good look for a moment with your
[1:34:28] own spiritual Insight at your soul
[1:34:31] just look around I'm speaking Across the
[1:34:33] Nation now
[1:34:34] just look for a few minutes you out
[1:34:37] there in Branham Tabernacle you and the
[1:34:39] Tabernacles on the west coast Arizona
[1:34:40] everywhere just you're at look at
[1:34:43] yourself for a few minutes
[1:34:46] you say that message you're preaching
[1:34:48] brother Branham it's wrong
[1:34:50] said look at yourself a little bit
[1:34:53] let the Holy Spirit search your minds
[1:34:56] with the word
[1:34:58] you'll agree with the message let Christ
[1:35:01] the anointed word search your own
[1:35:03] conscience let them get into you
[1:35:06] see
[1:35:07] if that's not right or not and that's
[1:35:10] just one or two things mentioned when
[1:35:12] there's hundreds of them
[1:35:15] when you take I've read over this time
[1:35:18] and time again
[1:35:19] but actually this today
[1:35:22] When I Was preparing and that the Holy
[1:35:24] Ghost
[1:35:25] revealed this to me this mind search
[1:35:27] your minds he's not talking about all
[1:35:28] your minds he's you have two minds you
[1:35:31] have an intellectual mind and you have a
[1:35:33] mind in your heart and he's saying all
[1:35:35] of this message when you start seeing
[1:35:37] it's about double-mindedness
[1:35:40] and here he's talking about up here he
[1:35:42] said Mammon being intellectual
[1:35:44] denominational thought
[1:35:46] versus
[1:35:48] God the word
[1:35:51] he was warned he's giving a warning this
[1:35:53] is the hurdle that we all have have
[1:35:55] maybe I'm preaching to myself but this
[1:35:57] is what God showed me and it really
[1:36:00] helped me if it helps one of you tonight
[1:36:02] then I'm thankful for that but he's
[1:36:04] talking about search your minds and this
[1:36:07] is actually a recipe on how to get
[1:36:09] Revival in your own life and that's what
[1:36:12] for me for three years it's been burning
[1:36:14] is that every time I read the message
[1:36:16] I'm opening up Lord show me show me Lord
[1:36:18] I Want to Be Right I want to I want to
[1:36:20] serve you correctly I want to be in line
[1:36:22] with you right it's how you line up is
[1:36:24] how you get back in Step it's the
[1:36:27] correct formula is you have to get rid
[1:36:29] of the double-mindedness
[1:36:32] every kind God turn a corner every time
[1:36:34] there's always this enemy of
[1:36:36] double-mindedness taking the word of God
[1:36:38] and mixing it with a past ages
[1:36:41] understanding brother Branham said back
[1:36:43] you know when they were blind it was a
[1:36:45] glare from another age or they're on
[1:36:46] their blind guides but you can't look at
[1:36:49] this word you can get a blessing from
[1:36:51] this word by an intellectual concept or
[1:36:52] an intellectual he goes on later this is
[1:36:55] just laying the foundation but he starts
[1:36:56] talking about Eve Eve received the
[1:36:58] intellectual conception of the word
[1:37:02] and all down through time there's been
[1:37:04] this threat of double-mindedness not
[1:37:06] going all the way on not being fully
[1:37:08] surrendered to God taking it with your
[1:37:10] own intellect taking it with your
[1:37:12] emotions
[1:37:13] and you can't but on the other side of
[1:37:15] this warning there's a great blessing
[1:37:21] he goes on and he brings actually uh
[1:37:24] from 79 to 188 he hits on the growth of
[1:37:26] the church and he brings it right up to
[1:37:29] the shuck
[1:37:31] and this is what Satan is all hell has
[1:37:34] been against this promise
[1:37:36] this is what he tries to rob us all of
[1:37:39] and it's through the Last Enemy is the
[1:37:41] double-mindedness
[1:37:44] he says and then the life comes out of
[1:37:46] that denomination goes into the grain
[1:37:50] then what happens when the grain begins
[1:37:52] to grow
[1:37:53] and to get bigger so we can cover over
[1:37:56] something the denomination pulls away I
[1:37:58] know we all are familiar with this quote
[1:38:01] why we why ain't we got a denomination
[1:38:03] eight of this
[1:38:04] they never will be it's the grain
[1:38:07] it can't go any further we're at the end
[1:38:10] time so what does it have to do now
[1:38:15] lay in the presence of the son
[1:38:18] to be ripened that's exact
[1:38:21] the word to be ripened into your heart
[1:38:24] to bring forth and live what we're
[1:38:27] talking about
[1:38:28] yes sir
[1:38:30] why did he talk about
[1:38:33] these other things about a
[1:38:35] double-mindedness or because that's
[1:38:37] what's going to write he said that she
[1:38:39] had new no dogmas no denominational
[1:38:41] Creeds no private maybe you're already
[1:38:43] there maybe this was just some but the
[1:38:45] Lord put this on my heart
[1:38:47] to speak this tonight it's someone's got
[1:38:49] to hear it
[1:38:52] see you can be robbed of this and he
[1:38:54] talks about a reward and I looked up it
[1:38:56] ripens like what does ripe I think I
[1:38:58] know what ripen means
[1:39:01] ripened means
[1:39:04] fully grown and developed
[1:39:06] mature
[1:39:08] having mature knowledge understanding or
[1:39:12] judgment
[1:39:13] it's suitable it's appropriate it's
[1:39:16] fully prepared it's ready
[1:39:18] he said this is what has to be ripened
[1:39:20] into your heart
[1:39:22] he's promising you maturity he's he's
[1:39:25] promising you phenomenal things
[1:39:29] he said brought by aging to full flavor
[1:39:33] of the best state that's what's going to
[1:39:35] be in your life
[1:39:38] never seen since the Garden of Eden well
[1:39:41] I guess we've seen it in Jesus and of
[1:39:43] course we're married to him
[1:39:47] I'm not an emotional guy but inside my
[1:39:49] heart just leaps for Joy when I read
[1:39:51] that that's what he promised and
[1:39:54] something in me says Lord give me that
[1:39:57] give me that I want it
[1:40:00] and we're receiving it
[1:40:03] this is not to be fiddling around with
[1:40:05] the word like it's a toy or something
[1:40:07] it's God has got a standard this is
[1:40:09] raising up the standard and when this
[1:40:12] maturity that happens he goes right into
[1:40:14] 191. he goes then you'll have no more
[1:40:16] doubts no more don'ts
[1:40:21] when you have no doubts you can pray the
[1:40:22] prayer of faith you can ask what you
[1:40:24] will
[1:40:25] this is a visitation that's promised to
[1:40:28] us
[1:40:29] but he puts a if it's a big if he goes
[1:40:31] then you'll have no more doubts if
[1:40:34] you let the Holy Spirit reveal it to you
[1:40:40] so if you try and take it with your own
[1:40:43] interpretation that past understandings
[1:40:45] a church age understanding
[1:40:48] it's not going to work he's got to let
[1:40:50] the Holy Spirit he said like the queen
[1:40:51] said about David talking about the
[1:40:53] interpretation of the dream what a
[1:40:55] promise
[1:40:57] have you received these are the
[1:40:58] questions I asked the Holy Ghost puts on
[1:41:00] my heart Donald Have you ever received
[1:41:02] this
[1:41:03] when's it coming
[1:41:07] a Revival what
[1:41:10] faith will clearly identify to you who
[1:41:12] you really are
[1:41:14] the word
[1:41:15] isn't that what it's all resting on when
[1:41:18] she knows her position when she knows
[1:41:21] what she is that's what lays in that
[1:41:23] promise right there the ripening it up
[1:41:24] in your heart
[1:41:26] it's the reward
[1:41:28] of getting past the double-mindedness
[1:41:30] surrendering all
[1:41:33] I used to have a little voice in the
[1:41:34] back of my head that constantly told me
[1:41:36] I'm not a son of God
[1:41:39] there were certain scriptures that
[1:41:40] people in my heart would want to believe
[1:41:42] but there was always that and I would
[1:41:44] listen to it
[1:41:45] I can honestly say today that it's been
[1:41:48] silenced for three years
[1:41:51] you can't get me that way anymore
[1:41:54] all my doubts are settled
[1:41:56] and my faith isn't based on my abilities
[1:41:58] my emotions or my feelings
[1:42:01] it's not based on that experience it's
[1:42:04] built and anchored because God said so
[1:42:08] that's where the soul takes rests that's
[1:42:11] where true rest is it's for years and
[1:42:13] years
[1:42:14] because of the only way I can reason it
[1:42:17] is we all of our Lives it's by the sweat
[1:42:20] of our brows sweat of our brow
[1:42:22] everything that we achieve in life but
[1:42:23] when it comes to this word it has
[1:42:25] nothing to do with the sweat of your
[1:42:26] brow it's God's on merited favor
[1:42:30] God's grace to us
[1:42:33] it's election the musicians want to come
[1:42:36] it's nine o'clock I don't want to keep
[1:42:38] you
[1:42:39] there is this was the beginning of their
[1:42:41] the part was actually when you really
[1:42:43] but I just wanted the when the Lord
[1:42:45] showed me this the double mindedness and
[1:42:47] that I was guilty of it
[1:42:49] he said one word off we're not capable
[1:42:51] of that there has to be if God requires
[1:42:53] that then there has to be something from
[1:42:55] God come to us to enable us to line up
[1:42:57] with the word and take it and to allow
[1:42:59] that maturity to come into our lives
[1:43:02] don't play with the word my brother and
[1:43:04] my sister
[1:43:06] come too far
[1:43:08] we've come too far
[1:43:12] I've been in the message if you want to
[1:43:14] say 25 years backslidden for about 12 of
[1:43:17] them
[1:43:18] Satan beat me down for some
[1:43:23] it was because of that voice
[1:43:25] I hadn't met him yet I heard of him
[1:43:28] heard all about them
[1:43:30] it's like me if I stood here and I held
[1:43:31] up a picture of my wife and I swear you
[1:43:34] think you know her
[1:43:35] you haven't met her
[1:43:37] that's the reality of this word you have
[1:43:40] to meet him
[1:43:41] any promise you would
[1:43:44] just have to humble yourself
[1:43:47] let them reveal to you
[1:43:50] how low you really are we're all born in
[1:43:53] sin shape there's not one good thing in
[1:43:55] US
[1:43:57] you have to recognize that if you can't
[1:43:59] recognize that then he can't work with
[1:44:01] you the song we were saying Break Me
[1:44:04] Lord
[1:44:05] he'll Build You Up he'll break you down
[1:44:07] he'll build you up I'm sorry I'm just so
[1:44:10] thankful for what God has done for me
[1:44:12] got me past that double-mindedness and I
[1:44:15] see it rampant
[1:44:17] and I'm not judging anyone or anything
[1:44:19] but when you lived it yourself you can
[1:44:21] identify it
[1:44:26] will free you from it
[1:44:28] you promised he would
[1:44:30] said you just got to line up with the
[1:44:32] word and the lining up the word is just
[1:44:34] casting down all on an understanding and
[1:44:36] just taking it the way he said it and
[1:44:38] let him lead you into it let him give
[1:44:40] you the freedom and the Liberty in it
[1:44:43] and when he does
[1:44:46] you'll stand and live like you never did
[1:44:48] because it's not you living it you no
[1:44:50] longer unders you never really think
[1:44:52] you're alone
[1:44:53] I used to I struggled from the time I
[1:44:56] was 13 years old
[1:44:57] up until three years ago with the lust
[1:45:00] of the Flesh and pornography
[1:45:02] and for a year I've wrestled and I
[1:45:04] didn't want anything to do with it
[1:45:06] and I kept running into the word running
[1:45:08] into the word for three years I haven't
[1:45:10] felt to it he burned it out of me
[1:45:12] that's all I can tell you
[1:45:16] I didn't do it myself and I'm I'm not
[1:45:19] saying he's going to do that but
[1:45:20] everything but the very Thorn In My
[1:45:22] Flesh the thing that crushed me every
[1:45:24] day
[1:45:25] Lord I don't want to do this and go back
[1:45:27] and repent and sorry Lord sorry I just I
[1:45:29] felt like such a hypocrite
[1:45:33] when I lined up with the word
[1:45:35] he burned it out of me that's all I can
[1:45:38] tell you
[1:45:39] amen what song are we
[1:45:44] want to stand with me
