them if you have a need tonight maybe make it known unto him with an uplift hand we also have a request tonight for the LA Quang family in Lethbridge and all the saints in Lethbridge that the Lord would just touch them if you would just restore them to perfect health let's just go to him in prayer tonight gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we thank you for the ability Lord one more time to come before your throne of mercy and Grace Lord Jesus father I spoke to a man this week that is just going through a dire situation and I said to him the only thing that I could do for him was pray for him and he said I don't think that there's any prayer that could ever help me father I pray tonight that you would just meet that need sovereignly Lord Jesus you know the man you know the family you know the situation Lord Jesus you know the beginning to the end father Lord I pray that you would just touch him I pray that you would just allow yourself to be made known unto him Lord Jesus Heavenly Father we pray for the LA Quang family in Lethbridge Lord Brother Johanna and sister Naomi and their children father we pray that you would just touch them Lord that you would strengthen them and encourage them Father Lord Jesus and the rest of the Saints there brother Gabriel and brother Jonathan Lord Jesus father we pray that you would just lead brother Joe's way Lord as he goes there to minister to them Father Lord we pray that you would just bless them abundantly Lord father we pray Lord Jesus for each one who is sick tonight Lord not feeling well sister Michelle Lord Jesus sister Lily brother Joel and our son Benjamin Lord father we know that the devil is roaming about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour Lord and we know that you are our healer and father we pray that you would just reveal yourself to each one Lord Jesus one more time that you are our healer father and we know that nothing can reveal that to us like getting sick Lord Jesus unfortunately it's the way we are in this flesh Lord we know this flesh has to perish this flesh will never ever make it to see O Lord Jesus Your Glory but we know that you already have a body waiting for us Lord a perfect body that will never see corruption Lord that will never be tempted that will never have sin in it Lord Jesus but father while we're here we pray that you would just grant unto each one of us Lord Jesus that Divine Healing that you promised Lord with those stripes that you took at Calvary father we pray tonight for each uplift hand Lord Jesus each need that was made known unto you father we pray that you would just Lord meet and exceed the need father in the hearts of your children tonight we just ask that you would bless our service now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight thank you musicians thank you brother Toby for stepping in found ourselves with a lack of a piano player tonight but we know the lord always provides tonight I just want to kind of go into the family discussion again if you could turn with fee in your Bibles to Ephesians chapter 5. I just want to kind of go back to where where we were some time ago talking about families Ephesians chapter 5 verse 21. submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband children obey your parents and the Lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the Earth and ye fathers provoke not your children to Wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father Lord we pray that we could just follow your word we pray that you would just take this word this word of life that we've read tonight father and that you would break it open to us fresh once again father that it would truly be our anchor point that it would truly be our Compass Lord that it would truly be our North Star because we know that you are the word father and we pray that Lord Jesus we could take this word into our heart tonight and that your spirit would come by here and Quicken it to us father that it would Quicken it to our souls we just ask that you would bless our service now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated it's like to welcome back everyone who was traveling there was a few people away certainly good to see you again I just have a couple of announcements we have a prayer meeting tomorrow evening here at the church we have the youth event Friday evening and we have a communion service on Sunday evening and uh yeah I do believe that we have brother Mervin taking the service next week is that right we have made a change but that's what's going to happen um yeah so certainly excited to see what the Lord has put upon our brother's heart and see what will happen sir enjoyed the service last week with brother Gilbert that was a wonderful service and certainly inspired me for last Sunday and next Sunday there's a lot there to talk about we've heard that Jubilee trumpet we've heard the freedom Bells we understand who we are and where we are at um just want to remember the youth banquet it's confirmed for November the 26th sorry for any confusion out there we had a little bit of a hiccup but we've got it figured out so we're going to go ahead with it and I trust it will be a blessing to everyone brother Toby has agreed to take the service for us there and we're excited to do that I believe it's going to be hosted at the shepherd Hall brother could you turn down the monitor again I believe there's a bit of an echo somehow I uh thank you I don't really need monitor myself um are you happy tonight just want to maybe get into talking about our family roles and maybe recap again and I apologize but I think it's just so critical in a day in which we live you know brother Branham talked about it how if if Satan could break motherhood then he could break the backbone of a nation and it's so important to recognize what Satan's desire is and that is to destroy the family and we can look around and see so many destroyed families it's just it's terrible and maybe I'm a little passionate about it myself because I come from a broken family I understand the implications of it and sort of what the repercussions can be in certain situations and it's not pretty and we know that that's probably one of Satan's greatest victories is to destroy families destroy marriages and so uh I just want to encourage us as family members those who are fathers those who are mothers those who are husbands and wives those who are children maybe even grandparents what what what is this all about why are we even here I think it's just a tremendous thought is to have a family that's the reason we're here and many people would say they've got all kinds of different Ambitions but once you get the spirit of the Lord when you eat the book and then his Spirit comes by and quickens it to you what happens something changes in your life and it's not what maybe you would think which is beautiful but you know I uh I just wanted to go back and and just remind us remember Ephesians parallels Joshua we talked about it for so long about going over and conquering uh the enemy getting into our promised land and knowing that when we're in our Promised Land we have total Victory there's no enemy that can stand before us but what I want to do is actually start to bring that right into the discussion now talking about families and and just to remind us that if we want to be conquering an enemy in our lives if we have an enemy that's attacking us who has an enemy that's attacking you I don't think anybody here is exclusive from that nobody is exempt from that we are created to be tempted and tried because God wants to work out his character in us he wants to squeeze out that DNA that Gene seed of God that he placed in us before the foundation of the world but if we want to conquer the enemy in our Promised Land we need to be in our position just like soldiers need to be in their position I can't say if I'm in a in a war that I want to be the pilot of the plane when I've Been Told old and trained to be the tail Gunner I'm probably the most likely to die in the situation but that's what I was trained to do so I need to go and be in my position if I'm not in my position as a tail Gunner that plane could actually wind up crashing because someone isn't doing their job we need to make sure that we are in our positions the wives to see our husbands husbands see our wives we don't have any busy pointing fingers and saying my wife my wife my wife or my husband or my husband or my husband what about us in our positions are we in our spot if we're in our spot then we go on our knees and we say prayers for something going on in our family God's going to honor our prayers but if we get self-righteous and we get prideful and say no your position is this and you need to be doing that because that's according to the word we're getting out of our position we're not going to be able to see our prayers answered the way that we think they will be we'll wind up in a trial again we'll wind up with whatever that situation is rising up and coming back to haunt us so we want to just remember that Ephesians it parallels Joshua perfectly brother Branham said it's not close he says it perfectly parallels Joshua how are we going to go and possess our Promised Land brothers and sisters we're going to go forwards in our positions the only way we can do that is to be in our positions and you know brothers and sisters if we notice that someone is out of their position why specifically if you notice your husband is out of his position that doesn't give you a right to get out of your position children if you know your parents are out of their position you still have to abide by the word but when you abide by the word and you go to go to God as a child and say heavenly father I'm I'm obeying my parents I'm doing what they told me to do and I don't like it I don't think it's right it's not according to your word because of the way their actions are if you want to see a change in your home as a child if you're in your position and you go to prayer God's going to honor your prayers wives if your husband's out of position you want to go to see God answer your prayers stay in your position you'll be in your position and then ask God to come on the scene and watch him he will what is our Promised Land our promised land is the Holy Ghost Christ in us the hope of glory you know I took a look back and I want to I want to get into husbands specifically tonight so I apologize if it really makes anybody feel uncomfortable I don't want to make anybody uncomfortable I just think we really need to remember the importance of the husbands of the fathers they're the leaders of the home and the whole entire family is dependent on the husbands and it's got nothing to do I'm not even talking about finances many people would say well the finances are the provider and so they're the boss and they've got every right to say everything about it you know what if we're doing that then we're just getting prideful we're getting out of our position right away when we start with that business we're talking about spiritual headships spiritual leadership we have got to be able to be the spiritual leadership for our homes I said Lord help me I'm walking this walk I'm talking it but I'm trying to walk it I have to but you know we can set an atmosphere in our homes and we do you know what's interesting this is an interesting thought I'm just going to throw it out there what we can see is is tremendous when we have children many times children will act one way with their parents and they'll act a totally different way outside of their family totally different why is that because the family the parents set an atmosphere and the children know it the children are the I would say almost the projectors of the atmosphere because they actually they feel it they sense it and they actually live it they they manifest whatever that is whether it's it's Joy whether it's anxiety whether it's fear whatever it is the parents have going on in their lives the the children are going to project it you can't hide it you know brother Branham says that we're creators I'm paraphrasing but when Divine love is projected what happens brothers and sisters if we want to see a change in our lives in our marriage in our families if we want to then we've got an opportunity to do something and I'll even say this we talked about having the the we had the PowerPoint on the screen there I don't know if it was last was it last week or the week before that we had it and we talked about being reverent in the house of the Lord you know we have the opportunity brothers and sisters to project Divine love in the house of the Lord instead of pointing a finger and saying they should do this or they should do that we can actually do something about it ourselves if we're in our position but if we get out of our position it's pretty tough to protect Divine love brother Branham says this out of 1957 when Divine love is projected now this is the prophet telling this story and it's a bit long but I hope you'll bear with me I got lots of quotes tonight probably won't even get through them but we'll just see what the Lord will do here brother Bradham says this in our home and try this at your home I I just stopped right there I'm like man this is the seventh angel messenger saying this instruction try this in your home and if there ever was a home that's confused and torn up as much as ours people from everywhere all over the world coming all the time in and out day and night all hours and I have noticed here some time ago my lovely little wife of 37 years old and completely great she stood between me and the public if there's any praises to be given to the Bradham family give it to her the telephone run you wild day and night and our house had been full all day and I went out and my little children little Sarah and Rebecca were fighting over some play blocks little Joseph the baby sitting on the floor screaming to the top of his voice in the kitchen with her face buried in her hands a weeping when I finally got the house emptied some in this room some in that room some in the basement and I walked in and I thought oh what a confusion she put her arms around me she said Billy I'm going crazy she said I haven't been able to get the children any dinner isn't it interesting right there being a man being a husband being in my position you know automatically I would think in my personal carnality as a believer well what were you doing right anybody else out there would be that way or is it just me and she said the children hasn't had anything to eat and I don't know what to do well I thought now there's just one thing to do now I'm tired but I'm going to do this think about this as we read this here's the seventh angel messenger there's people in the basement there's people in the bedrooms there's people all over the house he he giving discernment praying for people who knows how much he had slept here he is saying he's tired many times we'll go to work and we'll come home and say I'm tired where's my food where's my grub and she said the children hasn't had anything to eat and I don't know what to do well I thought now there's just one thing to do now I'm tired but I'm going to do this now heavenly father in my heart you help me to be what you would have me to be on this scene and I thought now if I can just get her quiet so I said Sweetheart would you rush out with me for dinner she said oh I'd I'd have to clean up all the children and this and that and you could hardly hear yourself think little Joseph just beating the floor as hard as he could so I slipped over and got an apron and put it around me and I began to help her and I just want to say this brothers and sisters I'm not saying put on an apron use the other part I began to help her I began to help her I didn't just put it all on her and say it's your problem I'm the provider you're the one that manages the house some might say this is just a prophet's wife of course she's in this situation and it's all bad that way but you know what if we're saying that I'm the provider and she keeps the home whose home is it whose home is it right what is a leader is a husband a leader or a boss we want to be the one who can actually help encourage pick up a broom do some dishes throw in a load of laundry you know maybe you'll say brother Barry you're crazy this is a message Church what are you talking that way for brother Bradham says she's your sweetheart you should treat her that way why would we expect her to be a Slave if we're doing that Brothers I would say just take a step back take a breath because the prophet said try this in your house what does she do all day I want to say this what if she works what if she holds down a job and she's not just a stay-at-home mom you know that's one of the things that this world has done too to say if you're a homemaker you don't do anything do you you have children oh you're a homemaker you're a mom a housewife you don't do anything you haven't accomplished anything you're a nobody that's a lie of the devil you have the hardest job that there is you have the most difficult job the job that's the most rewarding job that there is to be able to take children and raise them up in the fear and the admonition of the Lord Brother Branham says that the wife in the house is the pastor she's the one that gets to raise the children she's the one that gets to teach the children well Daddy's out but for Daddy to treat her like a slave on top of that is is terrible brother Bradham says try this in your own home when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace comes on the scene brothers and sisters that's the message that he's taken it out of there that I took it out of so if you've got a wife if we've got a wife that's working how much more are we to be digging in and helping if she's not home all day my my remember the quote says right at the very beginning of what I read tonight and try this at your home try and help out see what happens the Branham goes on to say and I said honey you know what I saw the prettiest dress the other day I just so wanted to get it for you and it was in a certain city just here close and we'll go get it and I want to say this this is a prophet he's not just coming out of thin air saying you know I I just want to try and distract her and say you know suddenly I saw this dress he saw the dress and he wanted to get it for her and all the time in my heart praying Heavenly Father quiet this dear quietness dear little woman and I put my hand on her not knowing her not knowing what I was doing I'd say yes honey oh it was beautiful oh Lord quiet this little woman and just kept on you know her not knowing what was I doing was projecting creating a different atmosphere walk in the love of God have Fellowship now some might say brother Barry now you're just going to tell my husband to go and do this and and change the atmosphere you know what it's his job if the things are out of control and things are upset in the home who's going to do it it's the husband's job that's what I'm talking about brothers being in our position that's the devil getting in the family mixing it up who's going to be the one to actually put out the fire and in a few moments she got quiet and then when she got quiet Sarah and Becky divided up all the play blocks Joseph got him something to play with and there was peace in the home Brother Brad I'm here he says what was it projecting love imagine if he just came in and said this is absolutely terrible you're out of your position wife get my food why aren't the kids fed why is the house dirty why aren't the dishes done on and on and on can you imagine what kind of a house that would be to live in terrible what was it projecting love whether Branham said he says they were mine they were mined my children my wife and I was God this is Brother Brown I'm saying this my children my wife and I was God you know Brothers you are Redemption for your family and without you there's no Redemption for your family that's the way it works what was it projecting love they were mine my children my wife and I was God and then God giving his spirit and through that spirit with love to my family Sovereign Grace come in and quieten the family down he says it'll do it I know it will remember he said at the beginning of this quote try it in your home it's not something that he's just saying I tried it and it worked well for me have a nice day help out Brothers help out children it's not just mom's job to slave for everybody you know what caused this situation what brought the peace in the home was the father recognizing that he had the opportunity to change it he had the opportunity to bring Redemption to the situation and you know I said it a minute ago but I'll say it this way he had the opportunity in that moment to either bring Redemption to the situation or wrath to the situation one or the other is going to happen every single time we have a situation brothers and you know what as sons of God what do we have to get upset about what is there in this world to get upset about really what's our greatest possession Brothers what's the greatest possession that we have here on Earth I will say it it's our family it's the family that God's given us because everything else in this world is going to perish outside of the word of God our family is the most precious gift that God has given us remember he has given us children on loan our children aren't our own their sons and daughters of God that he's given us to actually raise the right way and it's not up to us to actually project wrath to those children remember Billy Paul was going to spank his child he's going to spank him so hard the prophet said stop you're actually going to actually upset that boy's angel don't do it you know I I'm guilty of that times in my life where I know that I've projected a little bit too much Wrath and you know why I'll say this brothers and it's sad but it's true it's because I was out of my position and you know what happens when we're out of our position then we try and point the finger that's the way it works is what Satan does and you know when we've got things going on in our lives we talked about it on Saturday what a powerful meeting that was on Saturday for those who didn't make it hopefully we can make it to the next one but what a tremendous thing it is to recognize we're all the same there's nobody here different nobody is exclusive we're all fighting the same enemy and in the same ways it's not something that we can we can pretend that it's not happening but you know what happens is when we get secret sin in our lives I don't know why I apologize we get little things going on in our lives little secrets going on and we know that it's sinful Secrets what happens just the human nature it's the way the devil Works in our lives we'll try and project the the blame on someone else we'll put it off on someone else and usually unfortunately it winds up being our wives but we'll wind up putting it off on something else something else and really it's ourselves and if we can get ourselves out of the way we could see great success in our lives tremendous success in our families but I want to say this tonight all of us husbands and wives and children what kind of atmosphere do we project what kind of an atmosphere are we setting are we setting an atmosphere of Love Are we projecting Divine love recognizing the Divine love that our father has given us especially for husbands boy oh boy it can be easy to to point the finger and and say that we need to be in our positions and and I'm the leader and I need to be served but what has God done for us the grace that he has bestowed upon us is is beyond compare we can't even put words to it but remember the husbands are supposed to love their wives just like Christ loved the church right he gave his life for the church we come in from a day of work and we're tired and we're hungry and things are out of order and upset and going crazy how tired was Jesus when he carried that cross to Calvary the atmosphere brothers and sisters out of love in 1957 but the Branham says last summer a man was stung on a lip by a honeybee that broke up some kind of a blood Affair died before the doctor could get there Hornet will knock you flat on the ground when he stings you and hear a whole Hive of them over me but now instead of being afraid I don't know what you're going to think of me after this he says it doesn't matter because I'm telling you the truth you'll have to answer to God about what you think about it I hit them Hornets all around me and instead of wanting to fight them something happened I wasn't afraid of them what a tremendous thought you know what causes that brothers and sisters it's not just a supernatural thing for a supernatural man in a supernatural office it's for the supernatural class of people the prophetic ones the ones that just won't be deceived in the last day they have the ability to have this kind of power because it's not their power it's his power the only way that we're going to get this is to be in our position the only way we're going to see this success in our lives is to actually have a prayer life is to actually be in the word to be a part of a body to be in service the only way this is going to happen in our lives he says you've seen all them Hornets all around me and instead of wanting to fight them something happened I wasn't afraid of them I love them I thought little creatures of God stinging is the only way you got to protect yourself that's your god-given weapon and I Disturbed you out of your house I said now I've got to pray for God's sick children I'm the servant of the Lord now in the name of our creator Jesus Christ go back into your nest I'll not bother you no more he says and when I meet you at the Judgment bar them Hornets Whirled around me and took a circle I think how he says this and made a beeline and everyone went right back into their nest why the atmosphere had changed you might say brother Barry why are you saying this because we're talking about families I just want to say it this way you could take the example that brother Branham gave of his family maybe this Hornet's Hive is in your home and the Hornets are Little Devils and they're just going crazy in your home you have the ability brothers and sisters tonight to actually project love to the situation what's going to send those little Hornets back to their hive is love you can get out this water but you're probably going to get stung and it's just like that if you want to get into it with your wife and really hammer and argue and get into it and and say you're right and wrong and the other you're not going to get anywhere you're going to get stung it's just going to turn into a problem that you can avoid if you can projectifying love though because you're in your position you're going to see success but what's our greatest possession brothers and sisters I'm gonna just keep saying this like this I really want to try and encourage us Brothers tonight we have the opportunity to have leadership in our homes that this world has no idea about the whole entire world is trying to destroy the the concept of marriage the whole idea of marriage they're trying to pervert it that's what Satan's desire is you know I I heard a thing I saw a thing everyone's probably seen it how they're trying to change the law in the states how the the Mormon church now has agreed to say or maybe it's a Jehovah's Witnesses one of those two has agreed to say they're going to accept the same sex theory in their Church they're going to pass a bill in the U.S saying the same-sex marriage is going to stand all of these things are happening you know I just had a thought this week I couldn't help but wonder if maybe back in the days of lot you know it says in the Bible that as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the Lord I've always thought that it's just going to be you know maybe the the the the men in the street and and rioting but you know what they're doing is they're rioting in the street not necessarily for the Angels they're rioting over the definition of what marriage really is n't it interesting to think that the same way that it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man here we are the coming of the son of man we can recognize the day and the hour which we live in and they're doing that they're changing the definition of marriage and you know we're going to actually be raked over the coals for that I can see it loud and clear that's going to be where we have a problem in our lives as Believers of this word when we stand upon true marriage between one man and one woman and not two men or two women or whatever the personalities might be at the moment when we get into that sort of thing there's no escaping it they've already called it deemed it to be a hate crime to say anything against it so theoretically even what I'm saying is skating the line where I could be in trouble for that but you know we're going to talk about the word of God the way that he's given it to us and they're going to have to change the constitution of Canada to get us to shut up about it maybe they'll close the building maybe that will start to lose different things but they're going to have to take the Bibles away from us and say that we're not allowed to preach this word we have the ability to be different than the rest of the world we have the ability to be the leaders in our homes and we're not talking about the self-help gurus we're talking about applying the word of God according to the message of the hour in our homes understanding that that really is what it is you know in First Corinthians 11 Paul says be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ and I would say as leaders in our homes brothers that needs to be our Keystone scripture if we're not doing that if we're not following Christ in our homes our wives ain't going to respect us they're not going to follow us they're going to say I know that you say one thing when you go to church and one thing when you go home and you behave another way we have to have the congruent message we're going to fool a lot of people in our lives if we set out to do that but we won't fool our children we won't fool our wives be followers of me even as I also am of Christ how did Paul follow Christ to the death he was willing to give his life for it he knew that he ran the race that he finished the course he knew that he did everything that he needed to do he was the messenger for the age but are we following Christ as Paul followed Christ I say Lord help me how are we going to get our wives to follow us Brothers how is that leadership going to manifest in our home it's going to manifest through Trust our wives have to trust us our wives have to trust that we are actually following Christ and that we're not leading a double standard that we're not one way one time and one way another time when that happens and it's not a congruent message our wives are going to not really believe us that we're serving Christ it will become very difficult but you know for the people who aren't married if you're wondering about finding a wife or you're wondering about finding a husband people will follow the leadership that they trust and a Christian woman is looking for a man who follows Christ she is looking for a man who is going to be a leader she knows that a man who follows Christ will be a strong leader in his family in his home and and a husband is looking for a wife who is the same way who is actually willing to be led and that's just an interesting topic right there because we are the wives of Christ and we talked about it if we're going to have communion we've got to be willing to be led but some folks just won't be led they refuse to but that's okay you know it was the man in the Garden of Eden that wasn't deceived it was the woman that was out of our position in Christ in 1960 do you know ladies that it's wrong to wear slacks do you know that do you know that it's wrong to cut the locks of your hair off do you know no do do you know it's wrong mister for you to continue to smoke and act the way you do do you know it's wrong for you to not be the husband of your house your wife get a little temper spell and kick you out the door and you say bless your heart honey I'll come right back do you know how can you be a tender at the house of God when you can't even control your own house that's exactly right do you know a sister that your husband is not only your husband but he is your ruler God said so because that was the husband was not deceived the woman was deceived and you know we can get into this discussion here and and say that the woman is the weaker vessel and she needs to be led that way and we're not going there tonight but you know it's a spiritual weakness there is a physical weakness being a weaker vessel physically weaker sometimes females can be physically stronger it's just the way God created us but physically typically the female is weaker the woman is weaker but spiritually speaking it was the woman that was deceived and that's what the word is talking about so to say that a woman mentally is weaker is not a correct statement it's not I don't believe that's right entirely nope it's a spiritual thing more than anything she's weaker and brothers it's important for us to make sure that we're in our spiritual position for the weaker vessel it's not about saying that you need to actually just follow my rulership my dictatorship if that's what we're doing it's not according to the word it's not going to turn out right we'll get resentment that way like we said before Redemption it comes to the man the blood the bloodline comes through the mail we know that and it's interesting that the family doesn't take the female's name takes the male's name is that right it's a reason there's a reason for that because the husband's answer to God the husbands are the ones that will answer for their families for their wives for their own actions out of a life story brother Branham says enduring this time her mother and father had separated and I said we we went to tell her mother and I said Mrs bromback I said I found that wonderful people like that and she was sitting on the porch you know now don't get mad at me if you're here so she said she was sitting on the porch Fanning she said William I'll give you to understand I will never give my daughter permission to go out with a bunch of Holy Rollers like that oh my she said that bunch of trash said she'd never had a decent dress to put on her back I said well Mrs bromback it is an address proposition I said the thing of it is is that I feel that God wants me to do it remember this is his wife he's talking about she's saying her daughter but she didn't actually give her daughter away there and she said look why don't you go up there at the church where you've got a congregation coming and think about getting yourself a parsonage and and place to take your wife and baby too instead of pulling her out today she's got something to eat and tomorrow she's got nothing and things like this she said never indeed will I ever permit my daughter to go out like that and if she does go her mother will go to a grave brokenhearted and hope said Mama do you mean that and she said that's just what I mean that settled it hope started crying I put my arm around her and walked away I said but Mrs bromback she's my wife she said but she's my daughter said yes ma'am I walked away and went down and she looked at me hopeded she said bill that's my mother but I will go with you see I said God bless your heart she said I will go with you and she said honey I guess I'm carrying water on both shoulders I said I don't want to hurt her feelings she said what if something would happen to her and then you'd be worried all about all your life you broke your mother's heart I said maybe we'll just put it off for a little while and Friends there's where I made the worst step I ever made in my life right there we put it off a few weeks later things began to happen the flood on later from that the first thing you know wife got sick Billy got sick brother Branham is painting this picture showing that he was the man the husband of the home the leader of his wife and he allowed somebody to get in the midst of that we had talked about that in the past there can't be three people in a marriage there can only be two two people a husband and a wife and the husband has to be the leader that's the way God has instigated it from the Garden of Eden we know that that's the scripture God said that the man will rule over you after the curse after the fall when the curse was handed out but it's important to just recognize that it's solely placed on the shoulders of the husbands all of it for our whole entire family it's a very difficult position to be in but God's equipped us for it we're not going into this unequipped it's just important to recognize the gravity of it it's up to us to make sure that we're in our positions if we want to see success because really in the end who was accountable to God question and answers on Genesis in 1953 brother Bradham says now I think that would get that man and woman now a woman is let me get this in right good now he says so that you can see it see woman is subject to her husband and the Bible said that a man should rule over his wife but how they've changed that the woman rules over the man now you stay home John you're not going and that settles it yes my dear see but let me tell you something mister you are going to have to answer for your wife but your wife is never going to have to answer for you you are the head of the home and God is the head of the man and brothers when we look at that quote there I'm not saying it in such a way that we need to get the iron fist out I'll never say get the iron fist out I will say stand on the word of God present the word of God live the word of God so completely before your families that your wives will respect you that your wives will follow your leadership according to the word because if she is a Godly wife which she better be if you married her she may have the holy ghost in her life she better have it she will follow your leadership when you're in your position it's not something that's optional she will if she's a believer but that's where one of the greatest mistakes can happen in the life of a human being is to actually be a believer and marry someone and think they'll become a Believer if you think they'll become a Believer that's a mighty big risk you're taking there's no promises husbands have to answer for their wives not the other way around husbands will give account for their wives wives will not have to answer for their husbands and there can only be one leader in the home and in the family and the way that Harmony will come I'm just going to say it again is by projecting love by bringing love to the situation not an iron fist not demanding if we're demanding brothers and sisters anything but the word of God we're actually missing the mark we can actually I would say this we can actually be abusive we can take the word of God and make it a leverage against our wife or against our children and that is going to be something we'll answer for before God because Proverbs 15 1. says a soft answer turneth away Wrath but Grievous words stir up anger and if you go on further he talks about how someone who is really quick with their mouth they just get angry and burst out and have all that you can read it it's in Proverbs 15. it's not good we want to make sure that we're in our positions and that we're actually willing to offer a soft answer that we're willing to turn away Wrath that we're not going to get angry how often does God get angry with us how often does God give us the iron fist how often does God demand us as husbands anything but his word never he's a gentleman he always speaks softly to us it's always that still Small Voice it's always that that that that that love that we feel from him how could we offer anything but that to our family especially our wives that other half that one that was taken from our side our little sweetheart brother Branham says but you know the women they're not off the hook the sisters aren't off the hook I'm being pretty hard on the men tonight speaking about the leadership role and the importance of what it means to be a leader but remember sisters brother Branham and Look Away to Jesus 1963 she's always set my clothes to the cleaners talking about his wife here it's always sent my clothes to the cleaners and washed my shirts and had everything ready to go into the meeting and then she wonders how she can serve God he says you woman as you serve your husband you serve God of course and that is something that's in the desire of a woman that's something that's in the heart of a person to want to serve another we know that eternal life is living for others but we could say it this way eternal life is serving others eternal life is helping other people but Brother Brad I'm speaking specifically to the sisters to the wives as you serve your husband you serve God Annette you know he's looking at it from the perspective also that the wife is at home he spoke really strongly about sisters being out working out in the workforce he was quite strong about that and sometimes it needed to happen he said it sometimes the wives needed to work to actually make ends meet but other than that he was very strong about the women working not working staying at home to raise their children otherwise somebody else winds up raising your children it's not an easy thing I'm not saying one way or the other I say get the Holy Ghost in your life get the Holy Ghost and let him lead you you know it's like brother Branham says you know if you want to be healed why do you want to be healed what's your motive for being healed if it's just so you can go and travel the seven seas and see all the different countries in the world and and go and do all the things that you could do worldly speaking is that really the right reason or is it because you you have a position in your church or you want to serve your family or you have a purpose according to God's word what's your motive for getting healed that will dictate the outcome of your prayers when you ask for something for God and the same thing for our our husbands and our wives if we're going to actually pray for something in our family what's the motive what's the objective for it why do we want to have extra work why do we want to have extra income what's the motive and objective for that get the Holy Ghost he'll help you but the husband is the leader out of you must be born again and you woman that take another man in your arm you've marred that mold you were taken from remember that when you act like a man you're out of your place and when a man begins to get too and babying and this and that and the other he's out of his place he's the boss he's the ruler now I don't mean a floor mat I just said a ruler helpmate not to kick a woman around they're not but the Bible said God said in the creation you shall rule over you not be a boss but to be a help mate part of you Brother Brad I'm saying this here he says she's sweet and kind talking about our wives or potential future wives she's sweet and kind and tender you should lead her around sweetly because she's a part of you you go to mistreating her then you're mistreating yourself and a man mentally right won't do that we talked a little bit about it on Sunday the man the maniac from Galleria of the gadarians he lived in the cave he was naked and he ran around the Bible says that he cut himself harmed himself wasn't afraid to break the Fetters that they put on on the chains he was possessed with the devil and we know that many people know that story as Legion he had a lot of devils in him but an example of it a man doesn't mistreat himself who is in his right mind and that's an example of a man mistreating himself but I want to say what's the difference if we're cutting our wives how do we cut our wives Brothers with our words we can really cause a lot of harm with words we need to make sure that we're not mistreating her brother Branham says then you're just mistreating yourself and a man mentally right won't do that we know in Genesis 2 15 and the Lord took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest deed freely but the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for the day that thou edest thereof Thou shalt surely die why are you saying that brother Barry I'm saying it because God never told the woman that that's the point he told the man that but the woman was a part of the man so she heard that and even if she didn't have ears to hear while she was yet in him as the spirit or even in his flesh he was the one that had to make sure honey don't do that don't do that he's instructed us to never ever do that go and eat from that tree he didn't tell Eve that he told Adam God instructed the man the husband's responsibility is to be accountable to God according to the same word of God husband is to love his wife and to not be bitter against her we didn't even get into the scriptures that I wanted to read tonight we probably could that's out of Peter I believe it is the word says to love your wives husbands and not be bitter against them sometimes things can happen in our lives and we can start to develop feelings and you know we hear about it we've talked about it extensively in terms of a brother in the church brother to brother you know what if we have ought against another we ought to go to that brother right and actually deal with it according to the word of God and not let the devil get in but what about our wives and our relationship sometimes we can go down the road a long ways into our marriages through many different situations many dangers toils and snares and learn to not communicate and you know I'll just say it this way I'm I'm not afraid I don't think anybody has the the issue here but the the person that I was talking about in a prayer earlier tonight he's just separated in his relationship his wife has taken the kids and probably he'll never receive his family back they're gone and he's desperate he's in despair it's terrible but it's our responsibility Brothers to make sure that doesn't happen we can easily just point the finger and say it's the wife's but it's not it's ours because we're supposed to love our wives just like Christ loved the church willing to give his life for it but we can get so caught up in our lives that we forget to just take some time and Treat Her Like She's our sweetheart but you know the husband's responsibility is to be accountable to God for his family sometimes in our lives brother Branham says that I don't have the quote for it but every single human goes through stages sometimes our wives go through a stage where they change after the manner of a woman they go through that stage and they have a lot of different symptoms and you know sometimes husbands can get bitter against their wives and you know what brother Branham says about that when the woman comes to that change of life he says that's the time Brothers you want to be their friends that's the time they need support that's the time they need a real close friend not when someone can get bitter against them it can be so easy to actually get that way though if we're not in our positions that's why I want to try and encourage us Brothers let's have prayer meeting let's get together and do what we did on Saturday and confess our faults one to another so that we can pray one for another so that we're solid in our relationships as brothers so that we're solid shoulder to shoulder as soldiers for the cross when we know we have a problem maybe in our family maybe in our own life whatever it is the one thing we talked about was trust it's so important to be able to trust if we can't trust we'll never be able to do that but boy when we can trust I say Satan look out you know Ephesians 6 32 Paul talks about this being a mystery not about a husband and wife though he's talking about the husband and wife living together what he's talking about this great mystery is about Christ and his bride Christ and taking his very own bride and how much love unconditional he has for his bride that he would take the prophet for this age you might say brother Barry this is such a simple thing but I think it's so pertinent brothers and sisters try this at home try this in your home brother Branham said take that quote I'll give it to you if you want it brother Branham said try it in your home it works all we need to do is help out we could see a big difference out of a thinking man's filter in 1965 brother Bradham says oh for the grace of God that he'd give us such understanding of such great Mysteries as Paul spoke here further on down in Ephesians speaking of the husband and wife and said this is a mystery how the woman should be in respect to their husband even the second place I believe it is in the entire Bible that reverence was ever spoke to said the woman seeing that she reverence her husband reverence her husband then a husband ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as a son of God that a husband ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as a son of God and if he doesn't live that kind of a life well then course she wouldn't reverence him because she knows what he's made of but when it is a man that is reverent man reverent and clean with his wife and before his family a real servant of God then the woman children all should respect that servant of God with reverence and that will just happen supernaturally brothers that will happen supernaturally sisters if we have upsets in the homes let's just get into our positions and March forward together and just see what will happen all the Mysteries have been revealed if we can take the word and and apply it and not just apply it to say that I'm just going to take it and put it in my pocket I'm going to put it in my Bible I'm going to write it in my fly leaf I'm going to take that word and I'm going to eat that word and I'm going to go and live that word because I'm a part of that word that word's now a part of me I'm going to live that word I'm going to be a doer of that word not just to hear like James 1 but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves I want to say it again what kind of an atmosphere do we create we're all creators we've moved beyond the first poll we've moved beyond the second Pole now brothers and sisters we're in the third pole Ministry we're on the bride age we've gone past the layout to see an age even we're in the bride age we're in the spoken word Condition what Kind of an atmosphere are we creating in our lives we have the ability to create we are Messiah s we are creators what kind of an atmosphere do we create in our home well kind of an atmosphere do we create in our marriage what kind of an atmosphere do we create in our relationships with our children our children are solely dependent on on our relationships with them it's a totally separate topic and discussion but my goodness if we don't have a relationship if they don't feel safe if they don't have trust in us to come and talk to us about things in their life if they think that every time that they're going to come and talk to us we're just going to hammer down and preach the word to them are they going to come and talk to us are they going to confide in our lives they're not going to want to talk to us because they're just going to get preached at and when that happens what's going to happen they're going to find someone that will listen what kind of an atmosphere are we creating brothers and sisters I said now we've got to pray for this God's sick children I'm the servant of the Lord I'll call the musicians up I'm going to close here brother Branham in in in uh when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace takes a hold he says I said now I've got to pray for God's sick children I'm the servant of the Lord he had a purpose for divine love being projected he had a reason for it to be projected and I bet that every one of us have a reason to project Divine love in our lives in the name of our creator Jesus Christ go back into your nest I'll not bother you no more and when I meet you at the Judgment bar them Hornets Whirled around me took a circle and made a beeline and every one of them went right back into their nest why was that it was because the atmosphere had changed we have the ability brothers and sisters to change the atmosphere I don't know about you I can give you an example of a time in my life where I witnessed one of my boys changing the atmosphere and I believe it was the Lord living out through him brother Barry living in a condition where he had his little secret thing that was just not right before the Lord and just was upset all the time and always angry decided to Iron Fist the situation to make it better and what was happening was one of the children we're suffering for it and one of the other children jumped out and I'm talking small child four years old or less and said Daddy it's not supposed to be like this and you know what it did it changed the atmosphere in my life forever it changed my attitude in the situation I believe it was God saying you're about to hurt that boy's Angel you need to back off the atmosphere can change my goodness if a four-year-old could change an atmosphere what can we do brothers what can we do sisters maybe stand with me tonight gracious Heavenly Father Lord we love you and we thank you
