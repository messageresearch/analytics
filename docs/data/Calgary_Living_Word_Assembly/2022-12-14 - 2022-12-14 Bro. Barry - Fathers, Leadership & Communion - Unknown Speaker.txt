on Earth today Lord father we know it's not just us there's others all over the world father but Lord tonight we just want to recognize what you've done for us here Lord Jesus we thank you for your goodness to us Lord we pray that you would lead us that you would guide us father Lord that you would mold us and shape us father give us the ability Lord Jesus to see through your eyes father Lord Jesus this world would be a different place if we could see through your eyes father tonight we just ask that you would meet each and every need made known unto you father with an uplift hand Lord Jesus we know that prayer has already gone forward inviting you Lord to minister to us tonight so we just asked father that you would have your will and your way in our service we thank you for the praise report tonight Lord Jesus father we know that it's only by your grace that we're saved through faith we know that it's only by your grace that we are healed Lord Jesus we know that it's only by your grace that we're delivered father all of the afflictions of this world Lord we know we have many you will never allow us to be tempted above that which we could bear Lord Jesus Oh father but you will Deliver Us Lord you will take and use that thing father and Deliver Us from it Lord Jesus we just love you and we thank you tonight father we just ask that you would receive all the praise and all the glory tonight in this service father help me to get out of the way Lord Jesus and we just ask that you would have the preeminence now we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen welcome everyone God bless you tonight so I did have it switched one way oh it's completely off probably dead batteries sorry about that are you happy tonight sorry about the technical difficulty this thing has been giving me trouble the last couple of days that we were here first it fell apart on Sunday and now we have this but the Lord is good if this is as bad as it gets it's pretty good certainly like to welcome brother Paul and sister Elaine back home from their travels they had a wonderful time away in Louisiana I believe it was is it working now there we go all right God bless you tonight I hope it's not too loud now um wonderful if you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to just do a little bit of a different direction read from uh First Corinthians chapter 11. I have a little thought and just trust the Lord will lead us and guide us First Corinthians chapter 11. we had been taking a a long study about families and just different angles about it and last week we talked about um stumbling blocks Balaam and balak today I want to talk about leadership First Corinthians chapter 11 verse 1. be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ now I Praise You Brethren that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word we know that it's only three scriptures we've read tonight but Lord Jesus we know that just one word from you could stop the universe Lord one word from you father can create life and father we know there's many words in those three scriptures and we just ask father that you would supernaturally break them open to us that you would speak to us father from your word tonight we just ask that you would allow us father to just draw closer unto you tonight father through this service speak to us we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated you have a praise report I apologize I didn't say it earlier but I just wanted to maybe say it not in a prayer but we're thankful for the Lord sister Lane had come and asked for prayer she's had uh real issues with long covid affecting her lungs and taking her breath and not being able to function normally the way that she used to and you know we're going into 2023 now and that would have been 20 even before covid right is when you got it you got it before the pandemic basically and uh so when was that 19 or early in it was 20. yeah so we're just about a solid two years down the road but sister Lane came up for prayer and she brought a praise report today and uh the doctor said that her lungs are the best they've seen them in 17 years that's the Lord we serve that's our God right there makes it so easy to worship when we have those testimonies in our life where we know that he's dealt with us and you know what that does is it just it just drives those roots deeper we know that the the tree gets blown in the storm and and it feels like the tree is going to blow over and snap sometimes and we just don't know if God is hearing our prayers by the way he makes us wait sometimes but in the waiting it creates an Avenue for those roots to go deeper when he does answer because when that happens then it doesn't matter what comes along nobody can talk us out of it because nobody talked us into it he deals with us sovereignly it's sort of such a beautiful thing I just yeah I love praise reports I personally believe that our God he wants more praise reports than he does prayer requests and as Believers I think we have the opportunity to bring him so many praise reports we have just like we have the opportunity to bring specials we can bring praise reports for what the Lord is doing and that's one reason I love that with communion Services because you know the devil don't want us talking about what God's doing for us he wants us to think that he's a dirty old grandpa and he just isn't listening to our prayers but he hears every single word that comes out of our mouth even when it's a thought in our heart just a couple of announcements we have the last prayer meeting of 2022 tomorrow evening at 7 30 at the church for those who can come on service on the 25th I don't know what I was doing there um forgive me the 25th we're going to have service and uh it's because it's Sunday it's not because it's Christmas I don't want to adapt to being uh because it's Christmas Day we're going to have a church service that's for denominations I believe and maybe the Catholic church but we've got service coming up on the 25th and uh we it's going to be a special day we have a baby dedication at the start of the service or maybe at the end and then we have a baptism as well it's going to be a beautiful day we're certainly excited about that we have a communion service on the 31st and we'll just see what the Lord will do there certainly don't want to try and keep everyone until midnight but if you know the spirit of the Lord moves we certainly want to give him the opportunity to do what he wants to do as well um I just wanted to mention it we probably won't be in service after the 31st until probably the 18th realistically we're supposed to return on the 14th from Philippines but we uh we don't know what time we will actually get here I think it's supposed to be about 4 30 in the afternoon but if we get any delays it could be quite late or early we just don't know so likely what I'll do is just not come to service unless we get here in good enough time on the 15th but we will definitely be in service on Wednesday the 18th talk to brother Mervin today um texted brother Mervin he uh had a wonderful wonderful service yesterday already and uh he's got the itinerary booked up he is putting together the services so he's giving us a real nice mix of uh fellowship and a time of rest I really wanted to get that for Lisa and my family so the first week we're going to take a little bit of time and have a little bit of Fellowship I don't think there's going to be very much preaching but boy once that first week is out of the way the itinerary changes and we're going to have some fun preaching it'll certainly be a nice time um I think we're gonna we're gonna see brother Ray Soriano I think that's his name um and another brother I can't remember his name but it's going to be a an interesting time but brother Marvin certainly has his work cut out for him as well but that's you know that's the heart of it you know you want to go and meet the Believers and you want to talk about the things of the Lord you don't want to just go on vacation to get away from Christ and get away from church you want to find Believers and and find people of like Precious Faith so that you can pour from one vessel into the other and find out that the very thing that you've been feeding on back home is exactly what's been inspiring the people on the other side of the globe it's the same spirit it's just a beautiful thing we uh yeah so that uh I think about does it for our announcements tonight God bless you um I just want to talk about leadership again uh probably about the husbands more than the wives continuing on sort of with the the family topics but you know in a nutshell as the husbands as the fathers of the home we are the leaders of the home we are the ones that need to be making sure everything is happening we're responsible for everything the buck stops with us so to speak as the husbands as the fathers and the whole entire family looks to us and we can preach all we want and not live it our family ain't going to live it if our family lives it it's going to be a miracle but if we live it that's a different story that's where the power of Christ begins to manifest in our homes and in our lives and I just felt so inspired to you know maybe continue on with this thought of of leadership and communion you know we have we want that sweet communion with the Lord Jesus Christ every day of Our Lives sometimes maybe more when we come to church but maybe in our prayer or when we read the word but we want that sweet communion but we have got to be able to be led if we can't be led then we can't have communion that's the way the Lord set things out and it's no accident that the prophet for our age the messenger brought leadership first as the second last message that was recorded and then communion leadership brings us into communion with the Lord and as as as Paul said here be followers of me even as I also am of Christ so I've just been pondering this thought how does he follow Christ you know one of the things he says that he dies daily Paul dies daily and and and were instructed to follow him as he follows Christ so are we dying daily we know that he crucifies this flesh another way that he follows Christ my goodness how many wants to crucify the flesh that's a tough one that one but we know going back I guess in one of our other discussions maybe services that every person brother Branham in leadership talks about it how every person has to be led every person that comes into this world is led into this world and Led Out of This World we're led into the world with doctors and nurses midwives however it is with our parents we're brought into this world and we go out of this world with people helping us when we get to the age where we're sick and die maybe it's a traumatic thing whatever it is when we go out of this world when we come into this world we're LED as a child we're led into into the things that we need to learn how to deal with stuff as an adult we're we're still LED we still have employers we still have rules and governments we still have magistrates we still have leadership that we have to abide by what we want to talk about tonight is spiritual leadership we have to have spiritual leadership it's according to the word of God we want that sweet communion with God and many accept that leadership but we know there's no real communion with God if we can't be led and you know I would say it this way it's as simple as following the instruction of the Prophet for the age if we can't follow that instruction then can we really truly have that communion that we're looking for some people don't have the opportunity maybe to to be in in Fellowship I wouldn't judge anyone that way what I would do is Judge the heart of a person because brother badam says the desire in the heart should be to be in Fellowship sometimes the Lord will put us in a position where we just can't go to church and that's the way it works who's going to question God we we know that he has a way of doing things but when we have something in our hearts that wants to actually say well I can take most of that word from the messenger of the age but not all of it I'm just going to press pause there and say maybe that was a cultural thing or maybe that's something that didn't apply to maybe my family my family had a good good success rate in in everything that they did and and their bank account was full and the kids got educated and and everyone still goes to church when they get around to it kind of thing it's not like that we have got to be able to follow follow all of the word of God for our day because Paul said ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ it's got to be the instruction of God we have got to be willing to follow the word of God he he wrote an epistle to the Ephesians chapter 4 and it laid out the pattern there's prophets there's teachers there's evangelists and there's pastors and that's God's Avenue to deal with people what's it for it's for the perfecting of the Saints but when we circumnavigate that and try to do it our own way and say well maybe the prophet said something and and take it and manipulate it to fit something that we we want or or desire that's different it doesn't work that way it won't work and brother Branham said so many different things um I just want to say one thing today I'm going to press pause there I just think it's such a beautiful thought just bear with me of course I I didn't quite get it in my notes but I just think it's so beautiful I read it to my wife on the way to church I didn't drive I wasn't reading and driving my wife drove for me it was a really nice treat um I think it's just a wonderful thing you know in the message I've just been going through 1965 and in the message this day this scripture has been fulfilled brother Brown I'm right at the very end of that message he says something I think is just profound it's just exactly where I I live this is where I think every one of us does but he says this paragraph 256 I've read the scripture with a dozen or more evidences that were living in the last day the generation that will see Jesus Christ return to the Earth and I say to you tonight again this day this scripture is fulfilled in your sight not in your ears in your sight he says you and Tucson you in California you and New York on these telephone hookups this day this scripture is fulfilled in your sight what is he saying to us friends what is he saying in there wow the next paragraph the end of it he says let us be glad and make Mary for the marriage of the Lamb is at hand and her bride his bride has made herself ready brothers and sisters be ye followers of me even as I also am a follower of Christ we know that brother Bradham preached what Paul preached and that is kind of where I'm going tonight I won't say it this way I heard someone say it earlier that uh you know brother Branham was actually he was actually Paul for our day and and there's people that would say that's a uh uh the way in which you worship is what I call heresy because that would be a heretic thing to say for most people they would be on the floor to hear people say that but it's true nobody has a Vindicated Ministry to match the pattern that God set out for us do they nobody except for one and we know there isn't going to be another one because the bride hath made herself ready the marriage of the Lamb is at hand is what he said let us rejoice and be very merry is what brother Branham said we know the word says be very glad we have the reason to Rejoice brothers and sisters to recognize our position in Christ in Christ's position in us remember we were saying on Sunday if we could just step back and take a look at the situation of our lives and and and and and situations all around like the children of Israel when they were stuck on one side of the pillar of fire and the cloud and and the Egyptians were stuck on the other side pharaoh and his army but this Pillar of Fire and Cloud was right in the middle protecting them what did it look like from that Pillar of Fire if we could look at our problems from the pillar of fire I think it would just be a totally different world for us we we wouldn't be soon shaken in the problems that come our way you know brother Branham in this message this day this scripture is fulfilled he goes through and just talks about the the example of a slave and and how when you're a slave back in the day of of of the Old Testament times there was a Year of Jubilee and and when that Year of Jubilee happened everyone who is a slave anyone who had any debts everything was forgiven at that Jubilee trumpet there was a time where people had the opportunity to make a decision to leave their slavery leave their position leave everything they had and go right back to the beginning to where they were because everything was forgiven all the debts were forgiven they were no longer a slave they didn't want to be a Slave but they had a decision to make and I know that most people probably took it but brother Bradham says some people didn't some people stayed a slave they remained a slave they decided to stay in that position and once that happened they were taken down to the temple they had a whole board in their ear to mark them to say that they will not be free that they will be bound to that slave master for the rest of their lives because they rejected that Jubilee trumpet and for some people it might have been a lucrative deal for others it might not have been a very good decision at all but you know to decide not to decide is making a decision by saying that I'm not going to make a decision today I'm going to wait we're actually deciding and you know what we're deciding is to not actually hear that voice we're actually deciding to put us in the position of going down to the temple and getting a whole board in our ear and brother Branham talks about it from the spiritual perspective what it means is when that Jubilee trumpet this message of the hour brought by the messenger of the age according to the pattern God set out when that voice comes forward if we choose to reject that Jubilee trumpet we will get a spiritual whole board in our ear and our spiritual ear will no longer hear what the spirit saith unto the church and then we just get stuck with that slave master that we have whatever it is that afflicts us that's where we find ourselves the spiritual application is pretty heavy brothers and sisters we don't ever want to be in that position but it's so beautiful when we recognize that we've heard that voice and when we've responded to that voice when we say Amen to that voice we can hear a lot of other trumpets and a lot of other uncertain sounds in the world but boy when we hear the voice of the Vindicated Prophet playing something happens it stirs something inside of us my but we get a decision time when we accept it our spiritual awareness sharpens we become aware of things that we weren't aware of in the past we see things differently than we did in the past when we actually receive that Jubilee trumpet and we recognize that we're free my goodness for me one of the things and it sounds so silly brothers and sisters but I'm just going to be honest I've got to be one of the simplest things for me was to say I'm Free as a believer I'm free I don't ever have to worry ever again in this life about drinking and driving ever I don't ever have to have that fear what a stupid thing to even think but it's real by accepting that Jubilee trumpet it did something for me it created an awareness it gave me a sharpened awareness of this spiritual life and how it affects us and you know by saying amen by going to church by reading the word by listening to the message of the hour all of it works to our benefit it helps us but if we reject the word if we reject the message of the hour then we have a situation where it dulls our spiritual hearing and it doesn't stir us and it will come to the place where it will not stir us any more last week we talked about Balaam and balak and and looking at the negative and that was the the motive of of balak he wanted to get Balaam the prophet a true God Prophet to go and bless God's or curse God's people who are already blessed and and we know that his tactic was to take him and multiple times Go and show him the hinder Parts Go and show them the negative things The Faults and failures of those people who were blessed people but we know that you just cannot curse what God's blessed isn't that a beautiful thing it doesn't matter what people do it doesn't matter what people say you can't curse what God has blessed and I just I just wanted to take us back there and remind us that you know First Corinthians 15 says be not deceived evil Communications corrupt good manners if we're listening to that evil stuff brothers and sisters if we're listening to a balach trying to get us to look at the hinder parts of people because don't don't don't don't mistake it when we hear that going on when that starts to happen what that is is a balak spirit The Same Spirit that was in that King is the Same Spirit that's speaking to us through somebody else to try and get us to look at the negative parts of another person maybe it's a husband maybe it's a wife maybe it's a brother maybe it's a sister maybe it's a pastor or evangelist whoever it is don't listen to it just be followers of me even as I also have a Christ and you know this is so beautiful because in my Bible the footnote is Ephesians 5 1. it goes directly into families don't allow ourselves to get caught up in that life is too short God is too good we know that God has a very specific pattern set out every single age he has given his pattern I'm going to read a quote here it's out of the first seal I believe brother Branham says he come in the first stage the Ephesian age revealed sent the messenger notice what happens as we go along here is the plan of it the first thing happens there is an announcement in the heavens first what happens a seal is opened what's that a mystery is unfolded see and when a mystery unfolds then a trumpet sounds it declares a war a plague Falls and a church age open see what is the war part the angel of the church catches the mystery of God not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this mystery of God and then he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him just like Amos 3 7. that's me speaking The Amos 3 7 part Goes Forth to the people what does he do out there he begins to Proclaim that message and what does it start a war a spiritual war and then God takes his messenger with the elect of that age and lays them away asleep and then he drops a plague upon them who rejected it a temporary judgment outside of the first seal tonight brothers and sisters I'm reading that because I want to talk about Paul setting an example excuse me he was the first messenger the Ephesian Church age he was the one that came and set the pattern for the church he's the one be followers of me even as I also am of Christ we want to be hidden away in Christ be followers of me even as I also am of Christ now I Praise You Brethren that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you don't try and change them don't try and manipulate them don't try and make them fit our lifestyles or our Traditions just follow the ordinances that he's given us and remember we were talking about this how those millions of people on the other side of the curtain of time when brother Bradham went over there and he asked the question to that voice will Paul have to be judged the voice said yes he will and with his people he will come forward and be judged and he said amen that's good because I actually preached what Paul preached and and those millions of people on the other side the curtain of time beyond the curtain of time they all said we are counting on that and you know brothers and sisters supernaturally speaking every one of us was over there at that time that wasn't just a bunch of people that have just passed on and the other people are stuck in in another dimension don't think of it that way think of it in terms of this being the supernatural God and all of those people were you and I all of the Believers of all of the ages but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man the head of Christ is God as husbands in the home if we want to see our families follow Christ then we don't tell them what to do we show them what to do that's the way it works brothers and sisters if we want to see spiritual success in our lives we have got to be the leaders the brothers who plan to get married if you want to find the right wife the right wife is going to have the Holy Ghost don't think that she's going to get the Holy Ghost she better have the Holy Ghost and that wife is going to be looking for a strong leader with the Holy Ghost she's going to be looking for someone that lives by I am a follower of Paul even as Paul was also a follower of Christ that's the way it's got to work otherwise we could find ourselves in a real difficult situation where maybe that person that we decided to get married to just didn't have the Holy Ghost they were just in church and they were just a church member and for whatever reason they just hadn't gone all the way and boy when that happens there's no guarantees that person's going to go on to get the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and that is going to be a thorn in the soul not just the flesh that's going to be a problem but thanks be to God we have a pattern we have a an instruction about this what we can do about it you know the the the world every single age every single messenger brought their message for that age and the world has been given a very specific pattern to follow and every single age has had the opportunity to be faced with the word now maybe not every single individual I wouldn't go so far as to say that but who knows that's up to God there could be people that live on a deserted island in the middle of the ocean somewhere that maybe didn't hear this message of Paul I don't know we're not going to go there and worry about that I would just simply say that according to election everyone who is required to was given the opportunity to be faced with the word for their day and it's no different in our day we have been given that opportunity to be faced with the word and that's why we're here tonight because something inside us constrained us to say Amen to that word when we heard it well you know in the Bible there's an example the Rich Young Ruler Mark 10 verse 17 and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus saith unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear fall false witness defraud not honor thy father and thy mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have I observed from my youth and we know that Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven come take up the cross and follow me decision time he was faced with the word for his day and he had that opportunity to make the decision and it's amazing to think that he had the opportunity to accept that word for his day but he chose to reject it and I believe he chose sorrowfully to reject it he didn't reject it and say oh right oh you're crazy you're a Madman he he said there's something about this guy and he really knows the scriptures he's like the teachers but they say he's ignorant and unlearned so how could we follow him because he doesn't come according to the pattern that we're taught who is this guy it's astounding but he was given the opportunity and he stalled on it and we know that that did something for him that wasn't good but he was given that opportunity to make that decision and every one of us has the opportunity to make the decision and what's the decision for our day to accept the word for our day what's the word for our day the word for our day is Christ brothers and sisters we've read it we started with that quote brother Branham said this day this scripture has been fulfilled in your sight the coming of the Lord my goodness but the whole world is looking for something different they think it's going to be a great magnificent uh rolling back of the sky and and and God's going to descend and and everything is going to be like the children of Israel thought maybe he would come you know it's not going to be that way brothers and sisters it's the word coming of the Lord and he's already come that word coming of the Lord happened in 1963. and here we are now we know in Luke 16 is the the follow-up to the story that we just read and and verse 19 says there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple fine linen and fared sumptuously every day didn't have any problems in his life right verse 20 and there was a beggar there was a certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores and Desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels and to Abraham's bosom and the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torments and see if Abraham afar off and Lazarus and his bosom and he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am tormented in this Flame but Abraham said Son remember that thou in thy lifetime receive this thy good things and likewise Lazarus Lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormented and beside all this between us and you there is a great Gulf fixed that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that they would come from thence isn't it interesting to look at this story here and to think that here we have this this rich young man he was faced with the word for his day and he chose to stall in making a decision about it he chose to hold back and be reserved and maybe not really follow through with what the instructions were for his day and and by the stalling by the the resistance maybe but call it this way by the distraction that he had of what Jesus named was his problem he told him what his problem was his distraction was all of his wealth all of the goods that he had in his house maybe his family's business maybe he had a great degree and and created a business maybe he was a doctor maybe he was a lawyer whatever he was he he was a Rich Young Ruler he was he was a mover and a Shaker he had it going on but Jesus told him what his problem was and he wasn't willing to accept God's direction for his day and because of that distraction that he had because of that resistance to act on that word for his day here he finds himself in hell he finds himself in in Hades in this place where he's in torment and we know that he has this conversation with Abraham and Abraham says to him son remember that thou in thy lifetime receive this thy good things you had it pretty good but you had that one time that one day that one moment where you chose to actually resist the holy ghost in your day you chose to to resist the action of going forwards and following the word for your day and that caused you to lift up your eyes and hell now you're here and what do you want to have happen you had your chance brothers and sisters don't miss our chance make sure that when we hear that voice that word for our day that we act on it there can't be any distraction if there's a distraction we could find ourselves there we know the next verse 27 he says then he said I pray thee therefore father that thou would Ascend him to my father's house for I have five Brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of dormant he had a genuine now he was serious right now he wants to act on this now he wants to do something about it Abraham saith unto him they have Moses and the prophets let them hear them there's a not going to be a supernatural sign it's not going to be a great sign and wonder a ghost coming back from the dead to say you better watch out because you don't want to go to that place no God's pattern is the prophets God's pattern is his word God's pattern is to speak to man through a man according to his word Amos 3 7 we said right that's God's way of doing it not not some Supernatural thing and he said unto him if they hear not Moses or the prophets if if if their spiritual ears are poked and they just can't hear what the spirit saith unto the church if they won't hear Moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded the one rose from the dead can you imagine that they won't even be persuaded because they see a dead man come to life again a ghost come back and say watch out beware you're going to come to the pit it's gonna be hot you're not going to like it they won't even be persuaded by that it's it's it's it's it's it's the human nature and what it is is where that ear gets pierced brothers and sisters there's no going back from that we can cross the line brother Branham says that we can come to a place where we cross a line where we cannot come back from it and and that's a terrible place to be I trust that none of us are anywhere near that position tonight how did Paul follow Christ be ye followers of me as I also am a follower of Christ and we know that he was a Pharisee of Pharisees wasn't he he was the Hebrew of Hebrews he was the stock of Israel wasn't he he he started out in his his his days under gamalia and we know that he knew exactly what he was talking about when it came to the word there wasn't nobody that was going to school him about the word he was going to school anyone about the word but what it did was it caused him to come to the place where these people now coming up under this Insurrection under this this lunatic they called Jesus what he did was he said no no it's outside of the pattern now we're going to actually persecute this we're going to crush this because he was such a staunch believer of it so what did he do he went and made his Mark by persecuting the church that's what he did these people who were believers who were followers of the word for their day when they recognized there was error in the law and and there was love in and and life in Jesus Christ he wanted to crush those people but there was a time where he met that Pillar of Fire for himself and and he actually heard that voice he had that conversation himself he met we could say this way the word for his day he thought he had met the word for his day but he hadn't met that word for his day though all that he learned we know that he counted it as dung after this experience but at on the way to persecute the church he finds himself in a situation where he meets the word for his day and what happened to him we know that his sight was gone the way he saw things was changed forever he did not see things anymore the same way that light struck him down and we know that from that moment on he recognized I'm no longer a leader but I need to be led can you imagine that he recognized that God knows exactly how to get our attention so that we will be led if we are true Sons and Daughters of God we have the ability to accept it in in good time but if we are a son and daughter of God then he will make sure that we're looked after and it might even be to the point where he takes us off the scene brother Bradham talks about that Minister I don't know if he's a pastor but he is a minister and and he just got fed up with the carnality the situation whatever it was in his life and he went and got a box of beer and just decided to pull a trigger and get after it and and sure God let him he went and did it but then next week brother Branham said he found him in a hospital bed dying and and God took him home God won't allow anyone of his elect to be lost but here we have Paul the messenger the the pattern maker the one that all of the ages follow after the one that we're instructed to follow after he met the pillar of fire for himself on the road to lay waste to the church he was going after him this was going to be a great Onslaught for him a great Victory a feather in his cap if you will but we know that that word blinded him so that he had to be led himself he could no longer be that leader he could no longer do what he did what it was was a change in dispensations wasn't it brother Branham talks about it in the message I believe it's the Rapture he says that we're building a house and dispensations change they overlap and when they change you've got to know when they change you've got to be perceptive you got to be able to hear what the spirit saith unto the church but he was able to follow that leadership of the Lord into the house and he sat there and he didn't eat or drink for a couple days didn't he he sat there and he just wondered what happened to him he knows that he he knows the voice that voice he'd heard that voice his whole life but now he met that voice in person and now he can't see things the way that he used to see things but God showed him that he needed leadership and he showed him that he too needed to be prayed for that he needed leadership and after he was prayed for what happened to him he went out he didn't go out and say look at how God has has done for me look at how good God is I am now this messenger of the age he didn't go out and start beating his chest he didn't get puffed up with Revelation he got a thorn in his flesh that's what he got and and he said he sought God three times for that thorn in his flesh and God said hey you know what because of the abundance of Revelation that I'm giving you I'm giving you this thorn in your flesh so you don't get puffed up above all of this Revelation that you've been given but we have him in a situation where he goes out and he says my goodness I still remember all of the training that I had about the word and the Book of Moses and everything and how does all of this come together what is this and what does the word say he went out into Arabia he went for a few years to get all of that old Paul all Saul baked out of him and what did he do he didn't go and say I had this great lightning bulk experience Everybody follow me be followers of me as I am of Christ he went out and searched the word for himself he went and found the reality of Christ in the word for himself it became his own possession at that point and that's when he came and said hey be ye followers of me as I also am of Christ and we know that was a terrible thing for the church that was such a trial my goodness could you imagine if somebody wanted to come into our assembly and take an AK-47 and just start shooting people up and then suddenly come back and say you know what God has changed me I got struck down on the road to Damascus now I love you all forgive me for sinning against you how would that work oh my there's people that knew Stephen people were close to Stephen and they had to forgive him my goodness how does Paul follow Christ Galatians 2 20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh not in the spirit otherwise he would have said the spirit I think it's important to make sure that we get that in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God Who Loved Me and gave himself for me brothers and sisters we've got to crucify this flesh we got to crucify this flesh that's the only way we're going to see the statue of the perfect man live out through us remember brother Branham said it very clearly that we are not even converted until we get the Holy Ghost we have not received the new birth in our lives until we receive the Holy Ghost so why brother Barry do you keep harping about the Holy Ghost because we want to see people get to Christ that's why we're here and to encourage those who are he's still calling people we need to still be evangelizing we need to still be encouraging people to get into Christ be followers of me even as I also am of Christ you know if anyone could have claimed perfection Philippians chapter 3 Paul speaking here finally my brethren rejoice in the Lord to write the same things to you to me indeed is not Grievous but for you it is safe beware of dogs beware of evil workers Beware of the concision for we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh can't trust your feelings we can't trust our emotions kind of any confidence in the flesh in the way we see things here it's got to be a spiritual Revelation to us that's why we have discernment brothers and sisters in order to have discernment we've got to be in tune with the spirit we got to crucify this flesh we got to Die daily and if we do that then we can actually see God live out through us though I might have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might Trust In the Flesh I more talking about the flesh talking about reasoning and Consciousness and memory and being able to learn privilege verse 5 Philippians 3 here circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock of Israel The Tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of Hebrews as touching Allah the Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless doing the service of God but what things were gained to me those counted law those I counted lost for Christ and I count all things but the loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done that I may win Christ could we suffer the loss of all things in our lives today to win to be able to actually get that just like he said and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith remember it's by faith that we're saved through Grace not of Works lest any man should boast we know there's a lot of people who are really good in this world they do a lot of good things and they live a really good life and I I think I would be lost if it was a Works based gospel it's Grace that we live under but understanding that something causes us to respond to the word in our lives and we want to be followers of of Paul even as he was a follower of Christ and remember every time we say that we could say we want to be a follower of brother Branham even as he was a follower of Christ and we know that's a heretical heretic perspective but that's the way we worship isn't it the way in which you call heresy that's the way we worship he goes on to say that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended and I think that's the key for us to follow Christ as he followed Christ to follow him as he followed Christ is to recognize that we have not apprehended we won't apprehend until we have a new body but there's something inside of us that we have apprehended we've recognized was already there brother and I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before excuse me not looking at the hinder Parts not looking at the things in the past that have hurt us and and brought us down but recognizing verse 14 follow Paul as he followed Christ I pressed toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many be perfect be thus minded and if anything ye be otherwise minded God shall reveal this unto you it's just a wonderful thing here to say he is saying let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded we know that Jesus said be therefore perfect even as my Father in Heaven is perfect in this flesh people confuse that and say but I Fall In My Flesh I Stumble in my flesh I have thoughts in my flesh I things happen in my flesh how could I ever be perfect in My Flesh will never be perfect in our flesh that's why this flesh can never ever see Glory this flesh will never in inherit in corruption this flesh is the incorruption and remember we talked about Paul getting that thorn in his flesh we all have thorns in our flesh that we say you know and and I know I had in my life many times things where I I thought Lord why can't you just take this away from me and and I found that verse and and thought that's so comforting to recognize that you know he gave Paul the messenger of the eggs the first one the pattern Setter he gave him the sword in his flesh and we've heard varying discussion I'm sure about what that actually was but I heard something recently that just I thought was so good it just covers it all what it was was flesh the hybrid condition the thorn in our flesh is our flesh as long as we're in this flesh we've got a thorn and we're going to have it and that doesn't change the fact that we already have a body waiting because when this Tabernacle be becomes dissolved we already have one waiting for us in glory even though we struggle in this body there's something in that space that teeny spot in our heart that doesn't struggle we recognize and what it is being perfect brothers and sisters is saying Amen to the word for our day taking it according to the messenger for our age let us therefore as many be perfect be thus minded let's not think about all of the negative garbage in this world politics ain't going to get us anywhere worrying about the economic problems in this world is only going to Doom us it's going to bring us down but when we start to set our mind on Heavenly things then things will change in our lives we have an opportunity to set an atmosphere wherever we go brother Branham and God's provide away 1953 he says we're bound to sin now you will sin you're bound to sin because you just can't help it but not willful sin not willful sin not going out and getting a box of beer and saying I'm just going to go and get a box of beer and I could do that because I'm a big boy and nobody will ever know I could drive to a different town they won't know me there I could wear a mask and I could wear a hoodie and sunglasses and a hat really low and they will not be able to tell who it is I could just go and do that no no no no not that kind of sin the things that trip us up in our lives the the things that really we just struggle with habits remember we talked about habits before brother Branham said their Spirits they're just spirits that are coming around trying to oppress us they don't possess us because the Holy Ghost possesses us we're his and let's just get that right tonight we are his and and the devil can't touch us he can't take us the only thing he can do is come around and try and poke us and when he pokes us we feel like we fall those thoughts that come into our mind those aren't our thoughts and they're not God's thoughts they're the devil's thoughts but he wants us to think there are thoughts they're not our thoughts brother Bradham says now you will sin you're bound to sin because you just can't help it but not willful sin he that sins willfully after he receives the knowledge of the truth see they remaineth no more sacrifice for sin but every day you're bound to sin and we know that what brother Branham is talking about is out of Hebrews there Hebrews chapter 6 I believe it is and what that's talking about is unbelief and saying that the message of the hour just isn't uh completely right there's something just a little bit funny with it I just can't accept all of it that's what he's talking about that's willful sin saying I just can't accept it the way that God's given it and he says you're bound to be backsliding consistently constantly so it takes constant prayer to God Paul said I Die daily and if Paul had to Die daily how much more am I going am I going to have to stay there Dead all the time if Paul had to Die daily to stay right with God this just is if it's for nobody else it's for me I'm sorry it's a selfish thing tonight it's just incredible for me to think you know this is so powerful I believe this is a key to unlock the power of the Christian church in the age in which we live in we have all of the truth for our day but how does it apply in our lives brothers and sisters the battles fought on our knees brothers and sisters the leadership is fought on our knees when we have a problem in our life in our home the victory is going to be one on our knees our position is really on our knees before Christ brother Adam goes on to say and so we'll all have to do that just die out to ourselves and that's getting God's way now there's only two ways of anything that's the right way and the wrong way and them ways are your ways and God's way and you can't be in your way and God's way at the same time you've got to forget your own way to get in God's way and you got to get out of your own way to get in God's way for as long as you're in your own way you're out of his way I just think it's incredible to think about this as long as we're in our own way we're out of his way so forsake your way forsake your thoughts forsake everything and just rely one thing on thus saith the Lord that's all then you'll know you're right and you know brothers and sisters I just gonna throw this in here this is Brother Barry speaking here but we know that brother Bradham said it in the church age book and that's why the devil wants to Discount this church age book I believe it with all my heart because of that one Clause there's lots in there but just one this one here bugs him I believe it a tremendous way it rattles hell because the prophet for our day said rather God through the prophet for our day said to the church she has thus saith in mind and thus saith the Lord and the mind of Christ to know what to do with that word it's not something that's going to come we have it if we've got his Spirit within us who who is living in US Paul said I Die daily so that I die so that he can live whether Brandon goes on to say he says the on on thus saith the Lord that's all then you know you're right though you can't see it none of the senses will say it's right every one of them will say it's wrong but you know it's right because God said so that's what makes it right now his provided way now that's his provided way has been his word it is his word God's provided way for the human to live is not by your senses it's by his word this is this is pretty strong stuff here when we look at it because of course we're supposed to live according to our senses but it ain't what the prophets said it ain't what the messengers have said it's not what the word says Revelations chapter four part one it behooves us as Sons and Daughters of God to check up on ourselves every hour of the day Paul said I died daily yet I live not I but Christ lives in me see be checked up because you don't know what hour you're going to be someone to answer on high we don't know what hour just like Lazarus was carried away by the angels we don't know what hour that could happen could be any hour could be before we finish service here could be on the way home tonight could be in our bed while we're sleeping we could go to sleep tonight and think that maybe we could have spent 15 minutes in prayer before we went to sleep but instead we just lied down and and started to think about things and we just wound up going to sleep and never wake up we don't know we need to Die daily but I just have found this thought so amazing and I probably will stick on it a little bit I think there's a lot here be followers of me even as I also am of Christ you know First Corinthians 15 I protest by your rejoicing which I have Christ Jesus our lord I Die daily Paul is saying I Die daily I crucify the flesh I Lay My Life down Before the Throne of God brothers and sisters tonight the little word of encouragement that I wanted to bring I'll call up the musicians I I I just wanted to say it I think it's so important for us to recognize that our prayer counts our prayer counts for so much more than what Satan wants us to believe our spiritual success tomorrow depends on our prayer today amen amen and you know it's such an amazing thought because I I have always thought we need to have a scripture and and be able to have the ability to pray for a situation where we have the situation and yes that's true to a degree but our strength in our lives our true strength for overcoming tomorrow and the next day and the next day our strength is depending on us right now today and then next week is depending on tomorrow it doesn't work the way that we think we can just pray in the moment and God will just snap happen a solution our way and sometimes he will but more often than not brothers and sisters the success for us in our lives is depending on what we're doing right now it's depending on what we did yesterday and what we did before the day before that and what we did the day before that and you know what we were either going the way that God has given us or we were going our own way and if we were going our own way then we weren't in God's way and you know what happens is we open the door for the goats brother Branham talks about that that song that that brother Kelly sang that he preached and they said you know we we don't understand how the goats got in but what happened was they let down the bar they let down the bars and the Sheep got out and the goats got in and we know that's not a good situation because that's a type of the devil that's the type of spirits getting in and as spiritual leaders of our home we don't want to let the bars down we don't want to let the goats in our home Satan's not going to come in the way that we think he comes in he'll come in as a very flowery package but then he'll actually present himself as a bomb of some terrible disease or something that we're not expecting it's not the way it works we it doesn't happen the way we think is what I mean to say but you know how do we overcome in the moment brothers and sisters the more that we choose to Die daily that's how we overcome if we're followers of Christ as Paul is a follower of Christ he said he dies daily he said he crucified the flesh if we are willing to do that in our own lives then we will see success happen in our lives and and we were having a conversation about it you know how can we see the rubber meet the road in our lives when we have that great Temptation in our lives that comes around because every one of us has the thorn of the flesh we all suffer from many different things which is probably much more alike than we really want to actually understand but we're all created the same we're all created the same way we all came into this world through sin speaking lies having iniquity every one of us the same way but the more we choose to Die daily the greater our strength will become because he is strong in our weakness that's the song We sang tonight isn't it his strength is made perfect in our weakness not in our strength of our flesh and our understanding of knowing what to do but what happens brothers and sisters when we are looking for that delivering power the beautiful part about it this is why it's so good and I wanted to get here tonight I'm so glad that I can and I didn't talk too long but the the power the the the key the critical moment that I wanted to try and get across to us when we want to overcome these things these thorns in our flesh the Temptation the tempters that come around the Devils that come around and try and get us maybe in our temper maybe in lust maybe in whatever it is when they come around if we fortify ourselves in the word brothers and sisters we'll find ourselves in a situation where we'll say my goodness didn't that didn't that bug me before I thought that that used to bug me a year ago or six months ago we won't even be bothered by it and we'll Marvel that we were at one point it will just Dawn on us that that used to be a problem in our lives it won't be a struggle that we're trying to apply the word and find a solution and and calling someone to confess my faults because I know I've got this thing I got to deal with no way the battle spot on our knees and that fortifies us with the word and when we're fortified with the word what happens is the things that we thought we desired in this flesh we don't desire anymore those desires just vaporize they disappear and we get delivered from those Temptations those spirits that come around and and try and get us so many different ways but it all comes down to our willingness to follow Christ as Paul followed Christ and and that is dying daily getting on our knees and spending time in the word spending time in prayer prayer I think is the greatest weapon that we could ever have I know brother Branham says it I don't know if I have that quote tonight but I just believe brothers and sisters if we're willing to actually just lay down our lives in prayer we're willing to see God move in our lives in a greater way and if we've got struggles trials issues problems we can actually deal with them in a spiritual Manner and that's the only manner as a believer that we want to deal with things we don't want to uh Earthly solution a fleshly solution to a spiritual problem that's the worst thing that could ever happen we can be taught how to live with Spirits in our lives but who wants to coddle a spirit we can get rid of it in the name of Jesus Christ God bless you tonight if you'll stand with me gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight I pray that somehow some way we could have encouraged your children Lord maybe to just spend more time in prayer with you father to just maybe examine the word and see how Paul followed you after you revealed yourself to him Lord father I pray that tonight we would just be encouraged to recognize that there is overcoming power Lord Jesus and we can continually feed upon your word and as we can feed on your word we become the word and Lord Jesus there's no trick of the devil that can actually get us to stumble and fall we just thank you for your goodness to us Lord and we just ask tonight that Lord you would just take us a little higher in you and that you would just Reveal Your Word a little further to us and through US Lord Jesus and if it Be Your Will for us to gather again on Sunday we'll just be careful to give you all the praise father we love you and we thank you we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ name we pray amen draw me nearer I am thine O Lord I have heard thy voice and it told I love to be but I love rise in the arms of faith and be closer drawn to thee dropping nearer nearer blessed Lord to the Cross where thou has died Lord [Music] to thy precious [Music] consecrate me now to thy service [Music] alone [Music] [Applause]
