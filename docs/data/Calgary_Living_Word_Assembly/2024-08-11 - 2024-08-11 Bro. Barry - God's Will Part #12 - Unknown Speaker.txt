requests we wanted to bring Before the Throne before we go too far in the service today brother Steven DS brother-in-law in New Zealand he has a an illness it's uh Tri ginal neuralgia I think that's how you say it and that's what the uh doctors call it here on this side of Eternity and we know it's a devil right and we know under the authority of the Holy Spirit there's no devil that can stand and we just want to pray that Peter Bosch in New Zealand would be able to have an experience with the Holy Ghost and that brother Steven DS would be able to have the testimony that he's gone before the throne for his brother-in-law amen we also want to continue to remember brother mvin Panetta's sister who has a need to be touched by the Lord if you have a need this morning maybe just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we just love you and we thank you for your goodness and your mercy and your oh lord your longsuffering towards your children and father we just ask that if there's anything in our lives this morning that would get in the way father that would clog the channels Lord Jesus that would stop us from being able to approach you this morning in sincerity father we just ask that you would forgive us for it Lord we pray that before we go any further in this service Lord Jesus that we could just commit Our Lives unto you fresh once again Lord God that Lord we could come to you with confidence knowing that if our hearts don't condemn us then we can come unto you with confidence Lord Jesus father with trapped in this body here on this side of Eternity and we know that you know all about it and you've given it to us so that we can overcome it Lord and this morning we pray that you would just take us one step further in that overcoming of ourselves father we want to remember every need that was made known unto you this morning by way of an uplift hand Lord Jesus that you would just meet the need sovereignly father Lord we thank you for the the the ability to know that we can come unto you father with that confidence that we've already spoke about Lord knowing that there is an ending of our faith Lord and a beginning of your faith and we just pray that it would be your faith that carries us through that takes our our prayers unto you Lord Jesus this morning Father we thank you for meeting the needs we pray for brother mvin Panetta's sister Lord Jesus father you know the need you know the situation and we just thank you Father for the opportunity to speak your name once again to this situation father we'll be careful to give you the praise and the glory for your desire your will in that situation father we want to just remember brother Peter Bosch in New Zealand Lord Jesus brother Steven Down's brother-in-law we know that there is a scientific term for what's going on and Lord we know that according to mankind it's the most painful disease that there is known to the medical community Community but father we know there's nothing greater than you and your spirit and father if it would be possible Lord Jesus for a testimony unto you father we just ask that you would touch him in the name of Jesus father that Lord we would be able to give you the glory for touching him Lord and perhaps maybe he could come to know you father in The Power of your Resurrection the way that brother Steven DS has come to know you father and Lord God there would be a testimony that would now come out of this man's lips in New Zealand about the God that brother oh father that the Downs serve Lord father we love you this morning and we just Commit This need into your hands For Your Glory and Lord Jesus we just ask that you would take us Lord and lead us and guide us now as we

have an atmosphere set there's no mistaking the presence of God Revelations chapter 19 a very familiar scripture this morning verse 7 of Revelations chapter 19 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor unto him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for your goodness and your Tender Mercies to each and every one of us Lord Jesus most of all we thank you for the open word that you've given to us in this day now we just ask that Lord as we've read the the words the print on

glad that it never seems to go away um never seem to stop getting nervous when we come before the church like this but just a couple of announcements we have uh brother Andrew Glover here August 16th 17th and 18th uh the 16th will be a 7:30 p.m. service that's Friday 6:00 on Saturday and then 10:00 on Sunday God bless you brother Frank certainly good to see you brother amen wonderful to have you here as well um yeah we had the youth hike this weekend what a tremendous opportunity for everyone to get together and go and Hike once again out in the mountains and uh I understand it was a great success I didn't go but uh one of these times Lord willing I'll go I'm uh still kind of nursing a a a bum KNE but it's just the way it is right now and uh it's okay I'm glad that everyone else can get together and have the fellowship it's wonderful to see the youth get together and be in unity and it doesn't matter what church we're from it doesn't matter what province we're from we all serve the same God this morning I want to talk to us uh I just had this on my heart to get into talking about the spirit of Revival and uh you know we could say that there's times where Revival is important in our lives and there are definitely times where it's important to have Revival there's been specific revivals throughout the ages but I think that we are living in the greatest of revivals if there had to be one I would say it's this revival that we're living in right now and it's the bride's Revival and brother Branham doesn't necessarily word it that way as the bride's Revival but he does word it as the bride age and as we go further into the bride age out of the Leo see an age there is something that has to happen and that is a Revival the spirit of God stir up in the children of God and something happens we cannot come into a service and have the songs played and know what God has done for us and not have a personal Revival that is impossible for a person who knows what it means to be redeemed we know that all Heaven one day will be silent to listen to you worship to listen to me worship and it's got nothing to do with whether I Know chords or keys or notes or anything the word of God says to make a Joyful Noise and he's not going to say to us on that day my is it too cool in here for you or is it too hot in here for you to worship or is the drum beat a little bit too loud for you to worship or is the song leader just singing not the right song so you can't worship all of that's going to be irrelevant he said that if you won't worship me the rocks will immediately cry out unto me amen today we're talking about the spirit of Revival and really I'm just going to jump just the way that I do right to the punchline the spirit of Revival it needs to start right here don't look for anyone else to bring the Revival to your doorstep God's not going to do that he's going to anoint individuals with his spirit and they are going to set the world on fire but it's not even going to be a big Revival we know that's not going to happen we know that when the foolish virgin the unwise Virgin Goes looking for oil it's too late and we know she's already doing that if you look around and you can see what's happening it's already late there's already a shout behold the bridegroom cometh and we know that when that happens rise trim your lamps cuz the bridegroom's coming and we know he's already here we had a Vindicated Prophet stand on Earth and declare he is here some people are looking for for him coming but I'll tell you if you want to look for something look for his going am because that's what's going to happen that's the very next thing to happen in the in the order of events but let us just be glad brothers and sisters and rejoice amen and give honor unto him amen push aside all of the thoughts all of the carnality all of the isms all of the problems and issues he's not looking at them he's looking to see whether we're going to worship Him Hallelujah he gave us problems for a purpose so that we could overcome them and I want to say today if you've got something in your life and you just can't seem to overcome I want to say this you will overcome you have to overcome am because he won't be defeated and if you have his spirit inside of you Brothers sisters it doesn't matter what happens in this flesh remember brother bradam talks about someone who could potentially lose their mind lose their mind and go into an institution and not even be able to care for themselves but if they've got the Holy Ghost it don't matter it don't matter what happens to us in our Flesh on now the prophet for our day he was killed in a car AC no he wasn't he was injured in a car accident wasn't he right and he went into the hospital and we know many people people waited with baited breath thinking many different things were going to happen and I don't think I'd be any different had I been there at the time right but God took him home don't think that it's got to be a specific way a certain time a specific thing don't do that just allow God to move on the scene and see if he won't but just be busy being glad amen and rejoicing and giving honor unto him because the marriage of the Lamb is come it's not coming we talked about it in the past you know Jesus he he he came around and and he talked to his disciples and he called them he called them friends he said I no longer call you servants you're no longer servants I'm going to call you friends from now on because friends they tell friends Secrets they explain things to each other they help them with different things and that's what he said to his disciples you're no longer my servants following me you're now my friends and we know that it it it transpired from there it went further to to mount TR Transfiguration and he showed them some some significant Secrets there we know that a couple of them got to go with him and see Moses and Elijah and a a a time of of of adoption where Jesus was now adopted it wasn't just in the Jordan River he came and had his reignment changed he he changed he was transfigured before their eyes but we know when immediately they wanted to go into the carnal Realms didn't they Peter he he got into his his carnality and he said oh let's let's let's make a tabernacle one for you and and one for John or one for Elias and and and one for Moses let's just do this trinitarian thing let's just do this right and what did the voice out of the cloud say the Dark Cloud the bright Cloud overshadowed them and said this is my beloved Son hear ye him don't don't bother trying to do all of the carnal things that you think just just be glad and rejoice because this is an example of the marriage of the Lamb coming and the last part of it his wife isn't it interesting that brother bradam when he was here in the message of the hour he said I no longer call you church I call you bride I call you bride we know that when we have a bride our bride is before the wedding and and what happens is you get married the marriage happens and you no longer have have a bride sometimes you refer to her as a bride and there's nothing wrong with that because she's always going to be your bride but it actually moves from that and and there's a legal definition that happens she's no longer your bride she becomes your wife and the only way that can happen is by an intimate relationship and I got a little bit of inspiration for today out of the the marriage of the Lamb if you want to go and listen to that message I've got a little bit of a quote here that I'll bring from it but the marriage of the Lamb what a powerful message brothers and sisters we have the ability to be glad and rejoice and give honor unto him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and not his bride hath made herself ready his bride can't make herself ready his wife can his wife can because she's at an intimate relationship she knows exactly what he likes she knows exactly the way he likes it I say Lord help me prepare it the way that you like it I want to be in that position I don't want to be pretending I don't want to just assume to venture with without Authority I want to know that I've got it right but I just feel so inspired today just to preach to us to preach to me brothers and sisters about the spirit of Revival let there be a Revival that happens in my life and perhaps maybe somehow I could be an inspiration to one person to actually allow the spirit of God to revive in their life amen out of 1954 Jubilee Year brother bham says that no matter how much we try how great we try to or organize our people together and ban them it takes God to bring a Revival it takes God to bring a Revival that's why brothers and sisters I keep harping on it get the Holy Ghost and when you got the Holy Ghost get more Holy Ghost amen we got to make sure we have enough oil the only difference between the two virgins right the the five wise and the five unwise they all had lamps they all slumbered and slept they were all virgins they all even had oil five of them had enough oil five of them didn't how can we have enough oil if we don't follow the word for our day we need to come to church we need to get oil amen we need to sing that song In Worship here's my cup Lord I I lift it up I lift it up to you Lord because I can't get this oil anywhere else talking about Revival John Wesley you know one of the great ones one of the church age Messengers hey he said this about Revival I continue to dream and pray about a Revival of Holiness in our day that moves forth in a mission and creates authentic community in which each person can be Unleashed through the empowerment of the spirit to fulfill God's creation intentions boy that's a mouthful but I think if you if you listen to it and and maybe if you look it up or just go back and and and listen to it it's pretty powerful it's almost like the very last paragraph or a couple paragraphs of the exposition of the seven Church ages where brother bradam says I did not come to create an organization I I never once wanted to organize people what I desire is for man to have a true relationship with the one living God for man and God to have that link again that relationship and we know we've preached on it before we've all heard it I'm sure that the way to the tree of life is open now once upon a time when Adam and Eve sinned in the garden there was a flaming sword cherubims were set they were no longer allowed to have access to that tree of life when when when the son of man Ministry began to happen on earth when William Mary and Bram was here and that sword was placed back in his hand all that Adam lost he said had been restored what was lost by Adam access to that tree of life now to refuse access to that tree of life means death Once Upon a Time it meant certain death to go into it now to actually avoid it is certain death right we're not talking about physical death I'm sure that for Adam and Eve it was physical death I I don't know if anybody knows whether it was physical death or not I don't know it could be a a point of discussion but I don't think it matters today we're talking about spiritual death because we could leave this service today and say that was a wonderful service brother Barry maybe he preached good maybe he preached bad whatever happened we went and we had a little bit of worship and we heard a little bit of word and we can go on our way now and we're not going to necessarily get hit by a car because maybe we just didn't give our whole heart to God in that service maybe we had some reservations we're still going to go on and we'll still live our lives we're talking about spiritual death brothers and sisters physically we're going to survive physically we'll be okay this is about spiritual death to know that we know that we know in case we do get hit by a car glory be to God if I have to go to heaven today I've won we don't have to fear death right but that's where the devil resides in that great fear oh what if you're going to fail oh what if you die one of those two things is going to happen to you oh my what's going to happen to you I know what's going to happen I'm going to go on to Glory I'll go on and I'll see all those people who fought this fight all the way to the very end and you know not because they could it's because the spirit of God in them could and that's the only thing we've got to do is surrender to that Spirit when we do that you can't help but Rejoice There Ain't No Reservations with it I just I just love this out of the third seal in 1963 brother Bram he preached a series of of sermons The Seven Seals and some people actually might contest this and and whatever we're preaching to Believers here today out of the Seven Seals in the third seal brother bradam in paragraph 182 he says now that's what the reason today that the revivals that we're supposed to have we have de denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere that's amazing isn't it because during that time there was some pretty significant revivals wasn't there a Revival of ausa Street wasn't that a great Revival was wasn't there great revivals going on there's been revivals but here we have the Vindicated Prophet saying no it ain't nothing yet the bride hasn't had a Revival yet see there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it now and we know it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again see yeah he'll send it he promised it now watch now brothers and sisters I'm not preaching a Thunder's Doctrine I'm not saying that we've got to have anything unknown because I'm saying that everything in the message is known the entire message has been revealed to us if we're willing to take a look at it entirely it's completely open all seven seals are all the way open you can't have the first seal open unless you open the seventh seal because the seventh seal was on the outside of the scroll and when you open a scroll you actually have to open the first seal it's not on the inside it's on the outside that seventh seal seals all of them anyways I I just think it's a beautiful thing here how how we go I'm I'm just going to preach the way we do here we uh we deal with a lot of quotes and I think it's so important for us to say what the prophet ET said we we've got a bit of time left here and I I trust it's okay out of the exposition of the seven Church ages at the patmas vision brother bamy says let me just use another illustration suppose you need healing what does the word say well we have all read it countless times but did not get in the spirit when reading it right it's important to get in the spirit and I want to say the spirit of Revival this morning when we get the spirit when we get into the spirit brothers and sisters there's something that stir our hearts it stir our soul we know what the Lord has done for us suppose you need healing what does the word say well we've all read it countless times but did not get in the spirit when reading it did we did we ask God for his Spirit to teach us the real truth of it if we did we would call the Elders confess our sins be anointed and prayed for and that would be that isn't that beautiful it would that would be that it would just be it I'm sure that we've all encountered it in the past it might not come immediately but in his spirit it's all over there's no other court of appeal God will fulfill his word he says oh we need to get in the spirit and then things will be done don't go through the acts first get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch what God will do amen many times we will try to emphasize ize the mechanics we have to do the mechanics we've got to get the mechanics right if you don't get the mechanics right you can actually really upset things and I'm sort of embarking a little bit more into mechanics my own self these days and and as I look at things I think it's interesting I once upon a time was a mechanics Helper and really really got into engines and and all the timing of engines and all the moving parts inside of a internal combustion engine and you know if you get one thing off inside an internal combustion engine everything happens so quickly and so simultaneously one little thing off can cause everything to blow up we have to have mechanics but brothers and sisters it ain't going to do us any good if we don't have Dynamics and when the Dynamics come when we've got all the mechanics in place why would be we be afraid to actually turn the key and give it spark why would we be afraid of that we need to give it gas we need to give it spark but then brothers and sisters once it starts step on the gas pedal he wants us to don't go through the acts first get in the spirit and watch what will happen watch what God will do he has that in capital letters there watch what God will do am and you know talking about Services specifically when we get into church many times we have folks that are afraid to get into the spirit what what would the neighbor say what what would my family say maybe what would the deacons say right maybe what would the mus musicians say right what what would other people say maybe we're on YouTube what would people watching say brothers and sisters we got to come to the place where who cares because the only thing that matters is what he says that's all that matters amen because if we're afraid to declare him here remember the word says that he'll be afraid to declare us there right right I think it's interesting sometimes we look at little children and just see them worship freely worship they have no inhibitions they haven't maybe had situations in their lives that have changed the way they see things and uh you know the word says also that unless we're willing to come as one of them we won't even see the kingdom of God brother Brandon goes on to say have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of things that are in the world they go to their ball games I'm going to say their hockey games they go to their sporting events and their dances they enter into the spirit of it right they don't sit there like wallf flowers all dried up sticks brothers and sisters don't think that it's culturally our thing to just be quiet and just be in church and just be quiet and just be calm right I'm not trying to give us a pep rally but what I'm trying to say is if there's any place in this world that we can get excited brothers and sisters this is [Music] it I'll say this way I know people they'll just be like yeah you know amen yep maybe they'll let out an amen once in a while but if they go to a hockey game or see something on a screen somewhere and their favorite team makes a goal they're not afraid to say yeah where do we stand when we recognize what it means to be redeemed sir to know that we're not going to spend eternity in a place that was created maybe not eternity forgive me right forever and ever in a place that was created for the devil and his angels that's right we don't have to do that you don't even have to be afraid of that that's right prise the Lord we don't have to have any fear for that brother Bram he says these people in the world these people in the world they go to their ball games their sporting events and their dances and they enter right in the spirit of it and I'm going to say this and forgive me for saying it I I I was in the world world I want to tell you the spirit of Revival in another human being witnessed to me in my spirit it was not a human attraction from a man to a woman but that Spirit of Revival witnessed to me in my spirit and at that time I wasn't afraid to go to the clubs and I'll tell you something when people go to the clubs if you've ever been there they don't set still everyone is moving and into the spirit of it now I'm not saying we need to act like this is a club don't get me wrong but to actually be redeemed to know what God has done for us and and and to not be able to give him praise Or Glory or anything and just be Stone Cold and and be like a dried up stick like brother bram's talking about I believe there's something wrong he said the people in the world they enter into the spirit of it you might say brother Barry that's going a little bit too far talking that way just read what the prophet said better yet read what God Said through the prophet they enter into the spirit of it they don't sit there like wall flowers all dried up sticks they enter right into the feeli of things and become a part of things oh but how they hate Christians for getting in the spirit of God's word right right the spirit of Revival brothers and sisters let it start right here oh how they hate Christians for getting into the spirit of God's word they call us Fanatics and holy rollers there's nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but you can ignore that you can expect it right right knowing where it's coming from just go on and get in the spirit of worship and I want to say today just go on and get in the spirit of Revival the spirit of worship will take you right into the spirit of Revival and what will happen is it will become Perpetual in your life the Lord this is where I want to get to here brother brandham he says it God said through brother brandham the SP our spirit is clean brothers and sisters when we're talking about getting excited when we're talking about clapping our hands when we're talking about jumping up and down when we're talking about maybe running around the building because we just don't know what to do there's just so much inspiration so much stimulation of the Revelation that God has given us by placing an open word back in our hands remember this quote right here brother bradam says our spirit is clean it's not the filthy spirit in the club we don't have to be ashamed about standing up and saying glory to God I'm saved our spirit is clean it's fresh it's real it's not fake it's not impersonation it's not something that we're just trying to put on when you see someone get excited get excited for them if you can't get excited yourself remember it's real it's sober and serious but nonetheless full of the joy of the [Applause] Lord so here we go now we're getting into the sentence I want to say brother brandham or or the spirit of God or brother Barry who who maybe brother Vil maybe someone would want to jump up and say well he was the grammarian of the book so maybe it was brother Vil that said this the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the Lord yes amen amen amen preach it as the world is when it Savers and delights in its Pleasures amen no I'm not saying don't wear a shirt men and paint yourself Calgary Living Word colors and come to service I'll never forget brother Ken talking about that how people in Saskatchewan for the Saskatchewan Rough Riders they'll paint themselves all green and they'll go to the game and they'll just be all green they won't even have a shirt on and they'll just be doing their thing with their beer in each hand same thing for the Stampeders only they're red but where are we when we recognize what God's done for us remember he said it's real it's sober and it's serious but nonetheless just as exuberant the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the Lord as the word world is when it savors and delights in its Pleasures amen both Christians and the world are human both have emotions the difference is the Christians hearts and emotions are purely on The Lord Of Glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh so if you have any quarrels any concerns about getting excited about the word of God brothers and sisters about seeing that fire of Revival igniting your life just read this quote that's good we ought to be just as exuberant so what holds us back that's the question I want to pose to us I want to keep asking it what what's holding us back that's good from burning the roof off this building knowing what he's done for us if we're redeemed and we know what it means to be redeemed that means to be bought back not not not just purchased one day you always were his amen we always were his from before the foundation of the world and now we find ourselves purchased back out of the pawn shop out of Satan's pawn shop he chose us we never chose him that takes it to a whole another level when we start looking at it that way yes sir he chose us to have ears to hear what the spirit would say to the church in our day right that's right remember we ought to be more just as exuberant remember modesty I'll say that when you come to service just remember that don't don't be getting crazy now out of the Prophet Elisha 1954 brother bradam says now Elijah he was all that Prophet I may not have given you this one I apologize brother you know prophets get angry sometime right or he did so he got all out of humor and he being out of humor this may hurt just a little bit someone but I I say it reverently now notice he said if I didn't respect josephat I was going to get into this story today just for the record but I I didn't for time's sake because I want to focus on the spirit of Revival but here we have the prophet of God he gets talking to someone who's a a make believer I believe it's Ahab in this scenario I could be wrong it might not be Ahab but but he he he gets called to the scenario he gets called to the situation the prophet of God and and he says you know if it wasn't for this one righteous man I would not even look at you because you're a backslider and you know it you know exactly what you've done wrong you know exactly where you stand but if it wasn't for this man of God I'd have nothing to do with you now medely said notice he said if I didn't respect josephat I wouldn't even look at you nevertheless bring me a Minstrel interesting a stringed instrument bring bring the prophet a Minstrel and what was he doing he was actually warding off the evil spirits and he was calling on the holy spirit before the Holy Spirit was given right we know that bring me a Minstrel that's some music brother bradam says now some people criticize music in the church what's happening when you're criticizing music in the church brothers and sisters I want to get into this we're going to get into worship I told you we would for a long time and now we're beginning with the spirit of Revival when we're criticizing music in the church what we're doing is we're being tricked by the devil to not worship the devil is causing you to not worship right God's given us a building he's given us musicians tremendous gifts in the body absolutely tremendous gifts in the body he's given us all the instruments he's given us all the space we need he's given us the comforting the heating the air conditioning everything we need sound sound stuff we've got microphone everything we need to worship amen so what do we have what's hindering us from worshiping what's what's what's stopping us from from giving our very best all the way to God that he's looking for in our lives when the song leader comes up here and and sometimes once in a while it's just spontaneous worship it just happens but other times it's like we're waiting through a swamp oh my how do we get the people to sing oh let's raise our hands let's clap our hands brothers and sisters it shouldn't be like that the people in the audience in the congregation ought to be encouraging the song leader in fact I think the congregation has the ability to take the song leader off of his songs that he has already prepared beforeand and given to the song booth and just lead in spontaneous worship songs that weren't even on his notes remember what operates the gift it's the people if you want to see different worship Services bring it don't look for them to give it to you you're the one that brings it to them if you want to see better piano playing not that it's bad honey go on your knees and pray amen and say Lord change her heart change the way she plays if you have a a brother singing someone on the organ maybe the guitar maybe the boom box whatever it is if you want to see a change make that change make it on your knees see if God isn't God because he will come on the scene and change it but first you got to get right right but if you're busy criticizing then you're just falling for the devil you're just taking his bait and what's happening is you're missing out and you're wrecking it for everyone else come on now because we're not wrestling against flesh and blood when we come into this building brothers and sisters it's Prin principalities and powers and I guarantee you we have more in here than we can see there's more for us than there are against us but Satan comes to church and he wants to distract us he just wants to stop us from worshiping he wants us to think about that brother and what he did or what he didn't and that sister and what she did or what she didn't and that other thing and and the other way and all these different things and maybe it's not the way that I used to when I was a kid or the way my pastor did when I was young preaching now God doesn't care about all that what about right now just like we want his grace right now we want to forget we want to take all of our sin and put it in the sea of his forgetfulness why don't we just start doing that with our Traditions why don't we start taking all of our our teachings and just put them in the sea of his forgetfulness and say Lord if there's something more for me show me am be it unto me according to Thy Word but some people criticize music in the church but if music brought the spirit on the prophet then it'll do the same thing today see bring me a Minstrel my and they went and got a Minstrel and they began to play some real good hymn oh my I love this and what does he go on to say and the prophet said in there I imagine and after a minstral played a long time and the prophet got out of his bad mood and began to think on God after a while the spirit of the Lord come on him and when the spirit of the Lord come on him he began to see visions and brother that's what's the matter with the church today the reason we don't see visions and have just a little narrow-minded thought is because we don't pray long enough or do something long enough until the spirit of God comes into our midst now I'm just going to throw this in there because I'm a pastor and this is my position here I want to say this we have the prophet saying that I want to say we've got this many people they come to church on Sunday there's less people that come to church on Wednesdays and how many people come to church for a prayer meeting right right right do we want to see more of God yeah do we want to see the power of God move in our midst right brothers and sisters where are we at we've got the whole open word we've got the full access to the tree of life right don't rely on the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now some will say brother Barry you don't know my life you don't know my commitments and no I don't but I'll tell you what if you're willing to make a sacrifice right right you know I had a pastor and I'm so thankful for brother Ken because he taught me the truth he raised me up in the message of the hour the right way God bless you brother Ken but you know what he said he said any excuse is good enough when you really don't want to do something right and I know by experience brothers and sisters by owning my own business and and by being busy and all the different things in life when you want to do something you're going to do it am that's what happens you'll go into your schedule and you'll say I'm going to adjust this to here because I've got that right there and and you know what that right there is probably more important than the other thing over there amen you can do that in your life and if you think you can't just try it once try it once take a little step forwards into the kingdom of God say Lord I don't know how I'm ever going to do that I don't know how I can not take this one extra shift because it's going to help provide but I guarantee you if you do something like that for the Lord say Lord I just Commit This unto you I'm going to go to a prayer meeting I've never done it before in my life but I'm just going to put aside all of my carnality and I'm going to go and take that step guarantee you God won't leave you destitute that's right he's the god that will reward you a h hundredfold not just twofold or or tenfold look a 100 or thousandfold I'm not preaching a Prosperity Gospel what I am preaching is the the real present tense I am he's a God that Rewards that way am just try him but the reason we don't see visions and have just a little narrow-minded thought the music is too fast the music is too slow the brother reads too many quotes is because we don't pray long enough or do something long enough until the spirit of God comes into our midst if we used to sing the oldfashioned songs till tears run down our cheeks and I know some will say well that's the reason brother Barry we used to sing the old-fashioned hymns and unless we sing an old-fashioned hymn the spirit of God's not going to come is that right no it's not right no way because it's not about the song that's right right it's about the heart of the individual singing the song Amen if we've got the wrong heart we can sing an oldfashioned hymn brothers and sisters if we've got bitterness in our heart it don't matter whether we're sing in an oldfashioned hymn in our hearts and unfortunately when people want to try and put God in that type of a box and say that unless you sing songs this way unless you sing these songs I want to say this you probably got a little bit of bitterness somewhere inside there maybe you need to take a look and try and get it out of there because God will not be put in a box we serve a mighty God this is the god that hung the universe [Applause] but we used to sing the oldfashioned songs till tears run down their cheeks and sinners got saved even before the preacher got to the platform so what's happened what's changed maybe some would say well it was that time it was that revival time it was the age of the Revival was it maybe but I want to say we're not living in another Revival we're living in the bride's Revival brothers and sisters this is the age that all of the prophets they diligently searched for this Daniel he said let me look at it Lord I know it's there and we know the Lord said to him it's not for you son just just live your life in peace and know that you live to a ripe old age that Temple that you desired to see It'll be restored don't worry and everything's going to be fine but it's not for you it's for another group of people who's that other group of people hallelujah this other group of people is right here today were those people he used to sing the oldfashioned songs till tears run down their cheeks and sinners got saved even before the preacher got to the platform I can't help but think that is a powerful service before the preacher got to the platform Lord let this not be us but today we just have the old ritual oh I'm I'm going to come to service just after most of the songs are sung just so I don't have to listen to that beat just so I don't have to listen to that song leader I'm I'm just going to come and maybe glean a couple things out of the service and then I'm going to run out the door quick before I don't have to shake anybody's head nobody gets to talk to me not going to do that what are we doing why would we even bother coming to church but you know brothers and sisters what example does that set for our [Music] children but people used to get saved before the preacher even got to the platform can you imagine what kind of an atmosphere that was why am I saying it that way because I want to see it that way let's set that atmosphere brothers and sisters where people can come in off the street and get saved even before the preaching of the word just for being in the atmosphere and and I apologize if if if somebody feels like we're already there and it's already happening God bless you for putting your shoulder to the wheel and coming and and worshiping but if it pinches a little bit it pinches me a little bit it makes me think what am I doing what am I not doing I I want to see the power of God move in the service here I want to see our children get saved I want to see the husbands have such a REV in their lives that they set the example for their entire families amen where the husbands hunger and thirst for righteousness and their wives they look at their husbands and they say who are you and what have you done with my husband because I don't recognize you something's different about you that's what I want to see the husbands getting all the way into Christ and then the wives following their husbands and saying you're my Lord I want to serve you because I know that the prophet said as I serve you I serve God and it's not about slavery it's about realizing their husband is leading the family to Zion and the children have the desire to serve God with all their hearts because they know Mom and Dad serve a living God it's not just a dead tradition we go to church on Sunday we say we claim to believe the message of the hour but we don't live it yes sir you know brother bradam talks about it when a page is sealed my when a page is sealed it's sealed on both sides if you've ever seen one of those stamps we' got one in the back office for Calgary living W when we got Incorporated you can take a check and stick it in there it's for certifying checks and you stamp it and when you stamp it it stamps the stamp into the page and what happens is on both sides of the page you can see the exact stamp and it's the same with the human life brother bradam says it when a person is sealed it's sealed on both sides you're not one person at church and another person at home and if you are just say Lord help me I don't want to be that way I sure hope you don't want to be that way EXA I don't want to be that way we used to sing the oldfashioned songs till tears run down their cheeks and sinners got saved even before the preacher got to the platform but today we just have the old ritual cut and dried program we got to go through this and that and the other I'm afraid we're grieving the spirit of God away from us that's right don't you think so brothers and sisters we don't want to do that we want to say if the spirit of the Lord is moving in a song service let's sing another song Amen of course we want to be fed but it's Sunday right let's set aside Sunday for the the Lord some of us can't but if we could say just sing another song and and let that minst will be played and push back the powers of darkness and open up a a a a place for the Lord to come in and and and just give us that blessing that he wants to give us a thousand times more than we're willing to receive it if we could just do that get outside of our our tradition and just allow the Lord to move amen marriages would be healed amen relationships would be better children might want to serve the Living God but I'm afraid we're grieving the spirit of God away from us we just have an old ritual cut and dried program my I don't want to have an old ritual no I don't want a cut and dried program us we have to do it this way and we have to do it that way no way no way we've got to be willing to allow the spirit of God to move where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty amen and you know when we have Liberty that means we have freedom that's right if if the spirit of the Lord wants to worship a little longer if the spirit of the Lord wants to preach a little longer if the spirit of the Lord wants to preach a little shorter and just allow the singing to be a little longer if if the spirit of the Lord wants the singing to be a little louder if the spirit of the Lord wants to just move if we're in a cut and dried ritual brothers and sisters we're going to stifle them the spirit of the Lord is timid he's not going to bulldo his way in we've got to welcome him I don't know how many people were present just before Co took place we had a Wednesday night service those people that don't come on Wednesdays you missed out man we had a Wednesday night service where it was about 15 minutes of spontaneous worship when it came time for the minister to come to the pulpit I bet that if someone would have been here that wasn't serving God they would have wanted to serve God by that atmosphere that was here I could not even speak when I got up to the pulpit you know I don't want to look back and say well what song was that we need to go back and find the song and find the chords and find everything the way that it was no that's what we're talking about that kind of ritualistic perspective no we need to get ready the night before we need to get ready the week before we need to be thinking about how we're going to be a blessing in that service not what that service is going to be a blessing to me what are we bringing to the party brothers and sisters amen we talk about the spirit of Revival and I don't mean to sound like I'm angry I'm just trying to say my I want more of the Lord I know there's more to be had and you know I know I know I'll say it from the pulpit and on recording that I probably haven't done all that I could or should and I say Lord forgive me because I want to see the spirit of Revival happen in this church Revival comes from the word revive obviously but the definition of revive is to restore to Consciousness or life that's right to restore to Consciousness or life to restore from a depressed inactive or unused State bring back you know we were having a conversation and it was about hurts and how we can have hurts and we can have scars in our lives and and what happens is it can cause us to become inactive right right we come to church and we go home and we come to church and we go home and what happens is is we become spiritually depressed amen we get a low pressure system coming into our life storm clouds are there and we just can't seem to shake it we can't get out of the fog but I'm here to tell you and you know full well but I just want to encourage us the devil wants us to be depressed the devil wants us to be inactive right when you don't feel like worshiping that's the time to worship amen if you ever wonder should I raise my hands as high as I can maybe I've got a back problem I want to tell you that if you're willing to stretch it out and give God praise he will take and use that as an opportunity to show his healing power in your life amen but on the other hand if you want to take it and say I got a back problem and I can only raise my hands this High I can't go any higher than that you know what if you were born that way that's okay give God all you've got but then if you're going to go to a ball game and be like yeah and go a little higher for a ball game guess what he's not going to heal you so you can go to a ball game and worship because that's what you're doing when you go to a ball game you might say oh I'm just cheering my team but I'll tell you what you're spiritually worshiping whether you know it or not you know I'll never forget it I heard brother Aaron mcir talk one time about a brother who just could never seemed to get over the lust in his life never he struggled with this lust in his life and you know what came out in conversation what that brother was doing was he was listening to talk radio Sports Talk Radio Spirits travel in words brothers and sisters the devil is cunning he's not going to come as a as a roaring lion and a and a raging monster to our door he's going to be subtle he's going to look like a sports team he's going to look like a music team he's is going to look like all this different Social Media stuff it's going to just be soft and gentle and it's going to be subtle and it's going to be step by step by step and what's going to happen is we're going to become depressed and we're going to become unused we're vessels of worship we're created to worship God we prayed this morning that we would be just like back in the day of of job you know there was a time where the morning Stars sang together and that's all the Angels brother BR talks about he explains that all the angels in heaven the Heavenly hosts that were created to worship the morning Stars they sang together but you know what the sons of God they shouted for Joy the sons of God are you a Son of God today a son and daughter of God if you're a son and daughter of God then you've got every single reason to shout for Joy because you know what's happened you know what he's done for you in your life the word revive to restore to Consciousness to remember wow I I was alive Once Upon a Time My Eyes Are Open I've got breath in my lungs I'm I'm I'm back to Consciousness and life again and to restore from a depressed inactive or unused state to bring back I want to say brothers and sisters if we've got breath in our lungs if we've got consciousness of mind he is more than willing to restore to us our first estate if we have fallen he will restore us from a depressed State he'll take depression and kick it out you don't have to try and kick depression out of your life brothers and sisters all you got to do is get right with God and watch him come on the scene and depression will be gone amen you don't have to try and quit drinking alcohol the only thing you've got to do is get really honest with God and give him your entire being that's right and he will kick alcohol out the door you don't have to try and quit smoking that's right you don't have to try and quit weed you don't have to try and quit any addiction just get honest with God yes Lord and he'll restore you amen from a depressed inactive unused State Lord he'll bring you back that's the final part of number two in this definition of revive number three is to renew in the mind or memory to renew us back to our first love to take us back you know what that's what brother Bram said that's what God Said through brother brandham if you just want to get right with God and you don't know how sometimes we can go so far down a road and we just don't even know how to go and get back the only thing you got to do is go back to where you got off and if you don't know if you don't know just like we said before I I I think it's so good if we believe God to be God just ask him just ask him Lord where did I get off Lord where did I actually make the wrong turn where where did I I miss it what's what did I miss in my life what am I missing genuinely honestly with him and see if he won't actually reveal it I promise you I guarantee you he will reveal it if you're honest amen but you got to know what his voice sounds like am first you got to be able to quiet yourself enough to hear his voice amen but if you're willing to do it he's willing to do it he'll reveal it to you he'll show us and he will renew Us in the mind or in our memory he'll take us and and put us right back to our first estate remember what it was like when you first got saved come on now I say Lord help me I remember what it was like when I first got saved I wanted to go out and scream and shout all over the place and just tell anyone that would listen to me and they all thought I was a fanatic and I truly am I guess considering the way the world is today but how many wouldn't want to Revival like that in your life today it's totally available we can have that kind of a Revival making the valley full of ditches 1956 brother bradam said said if I didn't respect the presence of that righteous man the story that we talked about already josephat Ahab I wouldn't even look at you so he got himself all stirred up so you know when you get all stirred up and riled up like that it's not a good time to do any service for the Lord got to do something about it said you know what he said nevertheless go get me a Minstrel start praying playing I just want to pause there and say this brothers and sisters if we're being attacked by the enemy one of the best weapons of our Warfare is prayer it's the strongest weapon that we've got it's the strongest weapon in the universe but I want to encourage you if you can't pray in the moment just put a song on Amen put on a good worship song Amen put on a song that you know something that's soft something that's pleasing unto the Lord put on a song and just see if you won't actually change the atmosphere but I guarantee you if you do that if you if you take just a couple words breathed in prayer the word says that we should be praying continuously to pray without ceasing what does that mean it means to be having a constant relationship with the Lord we're not going to go to church and see him we bring him amen we don't come to church to meet with God even though we do what we do is we bring our licks of fire together to create the pillar of fire amen but he's with us everywhere we go if we have him in our lives if we're willing to surrender to him just breathe a couple words of prayer say Lord help me I've got this temptation and whenever that temptation is Brothers and Sisters You've been given Authority all of the authority of Heaven is behind your word if you're fully surrendered unto the Lord amen if You' got something that the devil's tempting you with then rebuke that spear in the name of Jesus Christ by The Authority that's been vested in you then put on a song and 5 minutes later you'll be scratching your head saying now what was that was I at mad was was was there a problem was there something going on Amen if you're honest if you're genuine that'll happen brother Ram says nevertheless go get me a minstral start praying playing now you believe that people you now you people that don't believe in music in the church what about that yeah said go get me a minstral I'm all riled up today my righteous indignation boiled over he must have been mad that guy come up here that borderline preacher stand out there and beating them children wrong down there and doing that oh how I could take a hold of him said I've got to see a vision now bring me a Minstrel and they went and they got all the music and they started to playing the music some real good hymn and the first thing you know when they songs returned to Zion when the music and the children began to sing from their heart yes amen it's not their tradition it's not their form it's not their Perfect Pitch right it's singing from their heart when that happened something happened when they got to singing from their heart something takes place the spirit of the Lord come on the prophet now that's good and nice to talk about the prophet isn't isn't it let's bring it home and if a real old-fashioned Godly singing and repenting would bring the spirit of God on the prophet then it'll do the same thing today am and notice he wanted to see the way out and the only way out they could do would be to have a Revival brothers and sisters I know that I spoke maybe a little bit selfishly saying I want a Revival but I can tell you by what we're reading by the words of the Prophet according to the word of God if we have problems and issues in our church we can push them back by having a Revival this isn't about putting anything on this is about giving the spirit of the Lord room to move not limiting him and saying I can't stand the way this happens and because they they play music that way I can't worship oh my that's not going to be a good enough excuse God's not going to accept that if a real oldfashioned Godly singing and repenting would bring the spirit of God on the prophet then it'll do the same today and notice he wanted to see the way out and the only way out they could do was to have a Revival so he had some repented Sinners that come in and the music played and the prophet saw a vision and the only way you're ever going to see your way out is an old-fashioned spiritual Revival if you've got a problem brothers and sisters if you've got an issue if you've got a situation I just want to say today by the power vested in me for this office there is a way out am there is a way out just have a Revival with the Lord in your own life the only way you're ever going to see your way out is an old-fashioned spiritual Revival where the Hallelujah of God God is ringing from the bottom of your heart an oldfashioned Holy Ghost sent Revival hits the place then you begin to see things then God will begin to reveal things then you'll wonder why these real Christians are hanging on why they're praying for you what a Revival and he got in the spirit now the reason that these people have dances if they didn't have a dance so they could get in the spirit of dancing you can't have a ball game unless you you're in the spirit of the ball game you've got to get in the spirit of it and we can never have a Revival in Shri board or in Calgary or anywhere else until the church gets in the spirit of Revival God can come and perform Miracles he can show wonders he can stretch forth his hand to heal the sick and The Afflicted the preacher can preach and the gospel as hard as he can but there'll never be a Revival until the Church gets in the spirit of Revival I know we've had some fantastic services and I know the Lord has spoke to us it many times but I believe there's more amen brothers and sisters there's more I've gone through and made a list myself of Believers in the Calgary area and I know there's probably maybe different places where people Fellowship but I know that there's people that are believers of this message that aren't in fellowship and you know what the spirit of Revival has the ability to draw people we're not looking for numbers that's right we're looking for a place where people can come and actually have that true relationship with Christ that true relationship that the spirit spoke through the prophet expressly at the very end of the church age book of the exposition of the seven Church ages where his desire was one thing that man could have that spiritual relationship with God that's what this is for that's what this church is about that's what the message of the hour is about amen he came to take a bride of his own choosing right and she knows what he likes the wife knows what her husband likes that's right she knows exactly what he likes that's right out of getting in the spirit 1961 that's the way you get a Revival it's when you really get in the spirit of Revival I just love the way the prophet says this here not whooping it up or something but by praying it down until there's a Revival strikes your heart until all the logs of ecclesiasticism and all the logs of fanaticism and all the logs of systems and I want to say logs of traditions all the logs of unbelief flows out and then the Waters of God comes falling down upon you there you are brothers and sisters it's for every single one of us we know that it's for whosoever will we don't have to live our lives in a state of being depressed in in a state of of of being unused in a state of just being dormant in in a state of saying that I I got this wound from maybe the way my parents treated me or maybe the way my parents didn't treat me maybe the way the pastor treated me I had all of my faith in this one pastor this one time I I was taught that everything that was good was in that man the reason that man was allowed to fall was so that you would stop looking at the man but not that you would stop looking at the man and stop looking at any man and just stay home and start playing tapes it's so that you would get your eyes off of man and get your eyes on Christ that's why he allows Ministry to fall don't look at man look at Christ get the Holy Ghost yes that's where it is and you'll get a holy man's taste amen but you know when we have a thinking man's filter that's got some sort of denominational or traditional screening in it what's going to happen is things of the world are going to get through we're not going to have the true damic power of Christ it's going to be dirty power right that's right remember the devil can impersonate any gift of God except for one thing the ability to receive this word that's it I just couldn't help but think about some scriptures that kind of talk about Revival we got a couple minutes left here are we okay in 2 chonicles 7 verse4 says if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves you know the word says to humble yourself in the sight of the Lord he'll lift you up I know we talk about this many times at home but for the people maybe who are visiting or maybe somebody else or maybe just a little bit of encouragement you know when we humble ourselves it's not coming to the altar at the front of the church and humbling ourselves and going down on our knees and and humbling ourselves to the preacher or or to the guest Ministry or to the deacons it's not about that at all humble yourself one another humble yourself to your brother or to your sister humble yourself to your wives say I'm I'm a servant to my wife I'm a servant to my family all the resources that I've got belong to my wife all the resources that I've got belong to my family step away from the control for a little while and see if God won't come on the scene because he sees you humbling yourself saying that I'm a good church member ain't humbling yourself sorry tenure in the church church I spent the whole entirety of my life in a message church so I'm a good person that don't do it what's on the inside what's in the heart amen are we willing to Humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord if we are he'll Lift us up that's his word but if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn turn from their Wicked Ways there's a few steps in there then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land amen you know brother bradam and one of the one of the things I was studying it can be so extensive you just wind up looking at so many quotes you can be confused and many times I probably look that way and I God bless you I I can't help it but you know brother Bram talks about the desert the desert things are dry and where things are dry they shrivel up and when they shrivel up they become prickly prickly prickly and you know what can happen is we can have things shrivel up spiritually in our lives and we can become prickly and you know what alls we need to do is follow the steps in 2 Chronicles 7:14 if you're his people and you're called by his name just humble yourself and pray and seek his face and turn from your wicked way sometimes Wicked brothers and sisters doesn't mean going out and and sitting at a bong and going to a bar sometimes Wicked isn't playing nasty rock and roll music sometimes Wicked is actually putting on a suit and tie and coming to church and claiming to believe the message of the hour but not believing all of it amen I'm just going to leave one or two words out I'm I'm just going to do it my way just like Frank Sinatra look at him now don't try and do the message your way do it the way that God showed us do it the way the Vindicated Prophet brought then you'll hear from heaven and forgive your sin and heal your land just I couldn't help but think about a desert a dry place all those plants are there and they're all struggling and hanging on for dear life but when the waters come what happens those plants have the opportunity to start to absorb that moisture brother badam says in one of the messages that those stickers tend to disappear the plants soften up everything that was once dry and prickly becomes soft and gentle and kind amen he will heal your land brothers and sisters we don't have to be afraid out of getting in the spirit 1961 brother bam says now now I can't tell you about your salvation you have to work that out yourself but Christ still lives and Reigns he's here tonight do you believe that what what do you have do get in the spirit and when you get in the spirit then you see the vision but as long as you say well bless God I'm a Methodist I'm going to say this bless God I'm a Baptist I don't have to put up with such I'm a Baptist I'm assemblies I'm Oneness I'm message all right go ahead you'll never see the vision but you throw that thing aside and get into the vision see Jesus coming and the church perishing there and get into the vision dig right down down brother I'm telling you something will happen to you then you will get in the spirit of Revival do you believe it I got one more quote I'll call the musicians as we close today maybe stand with me as we close 1963 how can I overcome he says now let's turn to Revelations the third chapter at the excuse me at the church ages repeating Church age but now we are well there yeah I could take this one text and with the Holy Spirit preach on it a hundred years and never get what's in it out can you imagine that yeah because in this one text like all the other texts in the Bible it's all tied together and I want to take my subject this morning of this how can I overcome how many people here ask that question question about things in their lives how can I overcome I'll tell you I do things in my life that I think Lord how can I overcome he says now I chose this because I think that it's a time we should never let the spirit of Revival die we've got to keep in Revival constantly revived every day Paul said he died he had to Die daily that Christ could live and as long as we're keeping this guy alive as long as we're saying no I only go that far I'm not going to go all that way no I I've been in the message all these years I don't I don't know I don't know if I can buy it I don't know if I can really accept it all as long as we're doing that God's going to say yeah okay that's fine but as soon as we're willing to say I surrender all unto you as long as we're willing to kill out that old man why not so that we can be a good person and and and wear our clothes just right and say Amen just right so that we can let his Spirit live amen he's not going to cohabitate he's not our co-pilot the denominational world has those bumper stickers God is my co-pilot no he is our pilot now Revelation the third chapter and beginning with the 21st verse we read this to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcome and I'm sat down with my father in his throne think about how he overcame brothers and sisters husbands when we want to be dictators think about how he overcame what did he do for his bride he laid down his life amen would we lay down our lives for our wives that might be asking a lot would we take everything that we've got and give it to her would we take everything that we've got and throw away for her he did he did he that hath an he let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches did you notice the arrangements of that see sat with me in my Throne not on my throne in my Throne we're seated in Heavenly places where in Christ Jesus we get to sit with him in his throne that means full Dominion brothers and sisters in my Throne that's his domain see and there as Christ is the ruler Throne ruler at this time of the complete domain of God so will the church be with him the bride will be with him in his throne in the entire domain see not on my throne but in my Throne see where his domain reaches a throne is over a domain and a domain reaches just as far as its boundaries does and this is from eternity to Eternity just think it it's not from this country to that country from from this coordinate to that coordinate this is eternity to Eternity that's the domain we're talking about brothers and sisters there's not one devil that can stand against you if you're fully surrendered to god let's just bow
