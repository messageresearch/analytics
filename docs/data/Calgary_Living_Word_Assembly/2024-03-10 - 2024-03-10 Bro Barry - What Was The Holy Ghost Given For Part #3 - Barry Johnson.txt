we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning thank you musicians if you have your Bibles today I would like to just continue on with our study a little bit about the uh talking about the Holy Ghost but I want to take a different maybe angle today maybe try and wrap up the the series that we've been talking about the the Holy Ghost if you could turn to Hebrews chapter 6 what uh what the Holy Ghost was given for and what is the holy ghost that brother bandam preached those two sermons I would like to move into a another sermon Lord willing and that will be questions and answers on the holy ghost that was preached uh right after Hebrews chapter 6 we'll just read the first two verses here of Hebrews chapter 6 verse one says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith towards God god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord we just invite you to have the preeminence that you desire and the words that are spoken today father I pray that I could get out of the way and just Lord allow you the opportunity father to speak to us Lord and father we just ask that Lord there would be Hearts to receive the word today father that truly you would change our hearts father all of our hearts my heart too father let us all draw nigh unto thee father Lord we just want to commit this service into your hands For Your Glory now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated um certain be thankful to be in the house of the Lord once again just a couple of announcements um before we get too far we have the ladies brunch coming up on the 23rd um Brother David dehart will be here for the Easter meetings 29th 30th and 31st we have brother Nestor Espen Neola from Philippines he'll be here April 20th and 21st and we have and brother Andrew Glover coming here in August uh that'll be August 16th 17th and 18 18th three services are you happy this morning amen there's uh so much that I'd like to get into but I just feel uh compelled to maybe do a little bit of a recap and just maybe remember go over what we've been talking about is the two sermons that brother brandham preached and and one of them is called what is the Holy Ghost and the other one is what is the Holy Ghost given for and they are a a a series that are in the message app the table two Services right together and uh I just think it's such an important one I I I just can't get away from it you know the first one is what is the Holy Ghost and and I said from the beginning it just really resonated with me it's important to not just talk about what is the Holy Ghost um although it is very important to talk about what is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is Christ the life of Jesus Christ that same Pillar of Fire that was with the children of Israel in the desert the same Pillar of Fire that protected the children of Israel from their enemies is the same Pillar of Fire that was actually recorded in the Sam Houston Coliseum and that was God himself making himself known to mankind showing that that same Pillar of Fire is back on Earth again it's not somewhere out there in the universe coming Somewhere in Time not just somewhere in the past but the present tense I am God himself back with people and so it caused me to actually go to a a place where I just couldn't get away from the thought who is the Holy Ghost because it's not just what is the Holy Ghost it's not just an intangible Spirit that's somehow someway going to come upon the church someday this is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and we know that brother bradam said that was one of the the the keystones for his ministry is to recognize that he is not somewhere in the future and somewhere in the past and and just ignore what's going on right now he is right here and and this has been on my heart for so long brothers and sisters if you want to see the Rapture of the church you're going to see it but what you're seeing is it right now this is the rapture of the church because we are going through a body change and eventually there's going to be a culmination of this body change where this wine the new wine is poured into the old Badger skins and those Badger skins these Badger skins will no longer be able to contain the revelation of Jesus Christ Lord and then we're going to have a body change we're not going to just become perfect someday Somewhere Out There it requires a bit of effort on our part but we have to have faith inside of us to mix with the word when it comes we know the children of Israel when they came out of bondage they were going towards the promise for their day but the word of God says they didn't have faith in their hearts to to mix with the word when it came and that was the downfall for them but what is the Holy Ghost is the first one who is the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ brother Bram he says that's what the Holy Ghost is it's a power it's a seal it's a comforter it's an advocate it's a sign oh my it's the assurance that God has received you I I've just got a few random ones brother Logan I'll I'll just pitch them and we'll see if you can hit him if not don't worry no pressure it's Christ brothers and sisters that's the Holy Ghost the very person of Jesus Christ and I think it can be so easy to put it off and and put it out there as something intangible and make it undefined it's the Holy Ghost and you know when it gets to that place then what happens is the devil can creep in and say well the Holy Ghost can be whatever you would like it to be the Holy Ghost can be your interpretation of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost can be my interpretation of the Holy Ghost and it could be their interpretation of the Holy Ghost we all have the Holy Ghost you know what one's going to be right the one that sticks with the word and not just the one that sticks with the word because many people will be Scholars of the word and reject the Vindicated Prophet for the day it's got to be according to that Vindication of a prophecy the prophet that God would choose to use to say hey there's a Time coming where we're going to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers and everyone in the Christian world who are Scholars especially would be able to say amen that's a scripture that's going to happen sometime but when right what if we said it's already happened amen there's a group of people that are already back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers we're not looking for for signs and wonders they just follow us but we've been in the upper room and we've been able to see that Pillar of Fire for ourselves and now that Pillar of Fire isn't just on a picture in a wall that Pillar of Fire is right here and the life Bears witness of it Amen brother bradam talks about it it's not it's not gossiping it's not going out and and doing all the things of the world it's not backbiting it's not all these different things that we used to do but somewhere somehow something happened to us we became a new creature in Christ Jesus when that Pillar of Fire came into our lives and burnt out all that stuff that's what the Holy Ghost is it's Christ the very person of Jesus Christ what was the Holy Ghost given for I want to say this who was the Holy Ghost given for for those people that have faith in their hearts am to mix with that word of a Vindicated Prophet that came in our day that's who the Holy Ghost was given for because who has the Holy Ghost today boy this could be a real maybe call it a rabbit hole of discussion and maybe a content ious issue like I said there's a lot of people that will say oh I've got the Holy Ghost I believe God sent a prophet maybe I've preached this message for for decades but do you live it do you live this message or do you just preach it brother bradam talks about the preachers they can be just as as mixed up as the as the as the leoty I say Lord help me I don't want to be bringing a false Doctrine I want to make sure it's true to the word amen but who is the Holy Ghost given for it's given for the Believers what was the Holy Ghost given for brother br he says that's what it is it's to make you you personally live a holy life not just say that I believe but then go out and destroy our brother or our sister in conversation or do a Shifty business deal and know that I'm going to come out on top maybe we go into a store and and we buy something for 99 cents and we put a dollar bill on the counter a and the person the clerk gives us change for a $10 bill and we say oh I could give them all this money back or I could say scored and actually go home and I could buy nine more of whatever it was that I just bought and the one that I just got was free isn't that nice that's not the life of a Believer the life of a Believer is going to say nope nope I I don't deserve that that's actually yours that's not mine right but you know the devil's watching and so is God that's a banana peel on our pathway bam says that's what it is to make you live holy life that's what the Holy Ghost is power for to set your affections on things above where God stands the the mind of Christ in you you can't help from seeing those things remember we were talking about this last Sunday and I didn't really want to harp on it today too hard but you know what we live in this world this world is is created in such a way that that the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and and the biggest one of all the pride of life is what we contend with in this world that's what brother bam was talking about we see these things everywhere we go he says when you look at them you turn your head that's right it's to make you you say oh I can't do it oh I just can't do it he says sure you can't and we know that this is the statement that most of call it the message believing young people that actually go out into the world they say it I just can't live it so why would I try you're 100% right even the prophet said you can't nobody can live it except for Christ and that's why we drill on this brothers and sisters get the Holy Ghost the only way you're going to be able to live it is for him to live it through you you say I can't do it oh I just can't do it sure you can't but the Holy Spirit came for that purpose amen that's what it did it come to take them out of you all them old habits and things that you're doing that old backbiting this one is I think probably the the most important brothers and sisters and forgive me for it but I think it's important we have to talk this way this is the age in which we live in it's not time to play church it's real easy to quit drinking and quit smoking figuratively to say these things that are such a big transition we can see a maybe a lightning bolt experience you no longer go and sit in the saloon you don't go to the bar you don't maybe go to the dances you don't go and do these worldly things but what about a religious spirit that loves to come and sit down in church in service and say my everything's good in my life brother bradam he says that old backbiting separating yourself saying bless God I'm a Methodist and I'm going to say this that old backbiting separating yourself saying bless God I'm a message believer it ain't enough you got to get Christ but the message believing the message will get you Christ amen and he says I I'll read the whole thing it just inspires me that old backbiting separating self saying bless God I'm a message believer he says Methodist here I won't have nothing to do with them Holy Rollers the Holy Ghost came to take that out of you that religious spirit that says you're an exclusive Christian you're not exclusive we're not exclusive the only thing that makes us exclusive is his grace in our [Music] lives it's that old time Holy Spirit the devil won't go near it right amen but that's why people fear it because they got a little bit of the devil around them and the devil won't let them go near it but boy the more you come around it you'll either get in or you'll get out that's what's going to happen and we know that's the word to the church in the back there I'm not just making this up brother Bram said it but that old backbiting separating yourself saying bless God I'm a Methodist bless God I'm a message believer I'm a good person you know what there's way better people in the world than message believers and even people filled with the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters we fall flat on our face right there's better people than people filled with the Holy Ghost when you want to judge people by works but we're not judging by works am the letter kth but the spirit giveth life you don't want to be backbiting separating ourselves saying I'm exclusive that's a bunch of rubbish saying we're exclusive you know what when we when we recognize truly what God has done for us it causes a great humility in our lives because we recognize outside of Christ but for the grace of God there go I I could be outliving on the street addicted to something but it's God's grace to us Allelujah that's what the Holy Ghost came to take that out of you brothers and sisters to deliver us from this world to overcome sin the devil and death that's what the Holy Ghost came for and and you know we're we just can't get away from this thought most of all in the day in which we live brothers and sisters the Holy Ghost what did he come for he came to Deliver us from ourselves there's this whole narrative that certain people can just divorce people in the message even divorce was written a bill of divorce was given we know Jesus talked about this this is totally off notes now it's going into a different realm but we know this whole bill of divorcement was given to Moses in in the desert and and and the children of Israel when they had Jesus in their midst and they came and they tried to tempt him and said why could why could we have a Bill of divorcement that bill of divorcement wasn't so that we could actually separate ourselves from our wives or our wives from ourselves that's a trick of the devil because the word of God says what God brings together let no man put us under amen but it was wasn't so from the beginning that that bill of divorcement that bill of divorcement was there from before the foundation of the world for the people who come so that they could divorce themselves so that they could divorce their old nature if you ever listen to Invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ you'll hear what he's talking about he's not talking about naturally separating from your husband or your wife and the whole world listening to that message took it that way and they had such tremendous outpouring of of condemnation because so many people were divorced and remarried and sure enough it's an important discussion you can't be a minister and be divorced and then and then be remarried while you're divorce that's not going to happen maybe if your your spouse passes away God takes your spouse home sure I don't want to get too far into this but brothers and sisters the Holy Ghost came to Deliver us from ourselves so that we could have a a a writing of divorcement for ourselves so it's once and and finished it's over we don't have to live with that old personality because remember brother Adam he said it very clearly God is not going to actually live with an an adulteress and unless your former husband is dead you are an adulteress so if we're trying to flirt with the word of God and pretend that we're Christians and Christianity but not willing to die out to ourselves to accept him then we are spiritually living as adulterers we've got to be willing to die out to ourselves that old man has to die so that we can observe the greatest Miracle ever amen not signs and wonders but although it is signs and wonders because it's not even normal it's not even natural the greatest Miracle of all remember brother bradam said it many times in the message and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies you don't have to look it up I'll just read it for time's sake um but brother bradam he says but that's what we are like we are now a wheat a grain of wheat in God's Garner how many wheat are here today in God's Garner we're all wheat here today but there was a time when we was a cucklebur brother Bram says when we was a cucklebur and God changed us from a cucklebur to a grain of wheat completely gave us a new DNA showed us that we're no longer a cucklebur we don't have to deal with all the things that we used to when we was a cucklebur and God changed us from a cucklebur to a grain of wheat he says makes the fruits different we don't just keep displaying the same examples of our life the same examples of our life it makes the fruits different changing your mind your ideas it's the greatest miracle that ever happened when a man or a woman is Born Again of the spirit of God and becomes a new creation in Christ Jesus amen great you know we've been focusing on the Holy Ghost a lot and I just can't get away from it because I know that we contend with spirits we contend with a lot of spirits we contend with a lot of people yes and they bring their history their their maybe culture maybe they're different things there's only one thing that's going to save us brothers and sisters and that's the Holy Ghost amen that's it a and as far as I'm concerned we could talk about the Mysteries we could talk about the seals we can talk about all the different things that there are to talk about in the message of the hour but all of it is for one purpose brothers and sisters that's to introduce the he bridegroom to his Earthly bride and the only way he's going to accept his Earthly bride is if she is he if she has his nature the only way she's going to be he and have his nature is for his Spirit to actually live inside of her amen we've been focusing on the Holy Ghost and you know it might sound like I I harp on it to the point where we just talk about the raptures being the only point I I want to just say today it's not all about that that's the culmination that's what's going to happen somewhere out there in the future it's definitely going to happen but it's also happening now we said that earlier but you know one of the reasons we focus on the Holy Ghost it's it's how we can overcome this world there is an overcoming power to every single situation in this world and we don't have to tolerate all of the devil's Antics we don't have to tolerate any of them we have to contend with them they'll come around he'll throw banana peels he'll have traps you'll have things that will try and stumble us all along the way that's going to happen but we're going to get back up and we're going to keep walking amen but as soon as we try and do it on our own without his spirit inside of us we're going to trip and fall and say man that hurt I I don't think I want to do that again I'm not going to subject myself to that kind of pain anymore but when we have his spirit inside of us there's something inside something keeps holding us isn't it doesn't something keep holding us what drags us to church on a Sunday sometimes we have so much pain and and anxiety in our lives but yet we still want to go to church right there's no way that any human could ever live this outside of Christ Living in our lives and you know brother bradam talks about it there's going to be a lot of impersonation of Christians millions and billions of impersonators of Christianity people that were never able to receive this word for their day but you know if we've been able to do it I just think it's all the more reason for us to Rejoice we have been given so much in our day if we're able to say Amen to the word for our day and you know if we're able to say say amen for the word for our day like I said near the beginning we're able to contend with our brother and our sister amen we're able to have Grace one for another am we don't actually become exclusive and say well I'm better than someone because none of us are better than anyone we're all Sinners saved by grace it's only what God has done for us amen oh my in fact I would have to say when I hear someone say that I would say I don't know if maybe there's been a real experience there because Grace hasn't really been expressed to the individual yet what true Grace really is through Christ Jesus brothers and sisters we are more than conquerors that's what the Holy Ghost is given for we need to understand it we can we can say it but do we understand it that greater is he that is in me than he that is in this world because when that happens brothers and sisters doesn't matter how far down we fall we're always going to get back up because he that's inside me is greater than my problem in my life isn't it interesting because even though we talk about falling down brother Bram he says it I would say this God says it through brother Bram the way up is what that's the way up how do we actually humble ourselves in the sight of the lord we say it all the time I just can't get away from it we humble ourselves before our brother and our sister we don't puff ourselves up and say this that the other thing it's it's it's the greatest Miracle is understanding that God has called us and and and chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world to actually be his representation here you know if we ever get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives when we get the Holy Ghost the true markers of the Holy Ghost is that we just desire to line up with this word that's all we can never do it on our own but when he the spirit of truth comes around th this is sort of just a little brief summary of of the Holy Ghost series brothers and sisters just what's on my heart how important it is for us to get into Christ because when we get into Christ we're going to love our brothers we're going to love our sisters even if we can't agree with them we're still going to shake hands and say God bless you I love you and we'll still be able to fellowship and and still be able to Fellowship can you believe that what a thing that is my goodness 1959 what was the Holy Ghost given for now we're going to get into the the quotes that I sent paragraph 150 brother brandham says one more scripture if you want to write it down John 12:24 let me quote it to you right quick what I want to do today is just wrap up sort of the end of that message and I want to get into the questions and answers into our scripture here of Hebrews chapter 6 Lord willing is it just about 11: now that time has changed just want to check if a corn of wheat falls into the ground except it die it cannot bring forth another life brother Bram he says now look one closing remark now and remember then it is absolutely now to you people it's absolutely essential and necessary and compelling and compulsory that you receive the Holy Ghost now amen I don't know how much more clear it could be said than that it's not just something Vogue that we're talking about saying yeah we'll be a better person yeah will be able to overcome as Believers of this word it is compelling it's absolutely essential that we get the Holy Ghost in our lives and necessary and compelling and compulsory that you receive the Holy Ghost now for if you don't you cannot come in the resurrection now watch God cannot break his laws we know that he follows his laws now I can't remember if I've got the quote in here but in this message brother bradam he says God he has a word and he sets the line and you tow up to that line and that's the way he does it when you want to serve him that's what we do we step up to the line that he positions for us and that's his word we don't make excuses for it and say well I I've been baptized in titles and and that's good enough what is a title you can't write a check in the name of a title you can't say I'm going to write a check in the name of my father if I did that it would mean nothing wouldn't it I would at least have to say in the name of Al Johnson for it to mean anything right I don't want to get into that sory what was the Holy Ghost given for brother Bram he goes on to say and I don't care what you look like or how things are or how unpopular or how popular you are how pretty or how ugly if you've got eternal life there you will live forever and ever and forever he says when the moon and stars is gone and the Earth has weeped itself into the mountains and the deserts and everything has hasn't it's no more and the world is toddling like a drunk man coming home at night and the Stars refuse to shine and fall from the heavens and the Moon Turns to blood and the sun blushes and hides its face when they see the son of man coming you'll shine in the righteousness of Jesus Christ to come forth from the grave as a young beautiful woman to take your mate and live forever and forever and forever and all Eternal ages you'll still be living that's what the Holy Ghost is for if you feel the least tug don't turn it away what is the Holy Ghost God in you what's it for to continue his work amongst his people to bring his church together to bring the church to a place in this day far beyond the Lutheran Methodist Pentecostals I'm going to say message Believers beyond all of that into a place to an adoption and a rapturing Grace that when this part of the church when the spirit moves into this church here it'll just raise it'll bring forth bring forth all the redeemed that's touched the spirit now I just want to be clear I don't want to be a problem brothers and sisters we believe the message of the hour we believe in William Mary and brandom we believe the message that he brought we would be considered to be message Believers but if that's as far as it goes it ain't enough because even the messenger would say don't just be a message believer get into Christ amen because when he the spirit of truth comes will be able to recognize what the messenger brought to this age and that's what the messenger brought was Christ so when I throw off when you hear me saying that about message Believers I'm talking about people that just say I believe God sent a prophet and that's as far as it goes brothers and sisters that's not enough we've got to get into Christ we've got to be willing to sing the Praises of God we've got to be willing to have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ amen we're not willing to be fundamentalists that are just good people cled in Robes of righteousness we know that's what Adam and Eve did in the beginning they tried to hide themselves they tried to say we've got a religion our religion's good our religion's no good we know that what the word of God says that our our righteousness is what filthy rags before him all things are naked before him we can't hide nothing from him even though he stands on the outside and knocks on the door he won't let himself in he could he can see right through that door he can see right down underneath the stairs in that house he can see every single hidden room right through into the most secure locked safe those places that we don't even like to go in our minds and our hearts he looks right to it and he says I just want to come in and help you I'll help you deal with all of that just open the door to me and I'll come in and Su with you right so I'm not throwing off on the message of the hour I believe the message of the hour I preach the message of the hour the message of the hour is Christ in you the hope of glory the Heavenly bridegroom now in in in I want to say a visible Union with the bride of Jesus Christ here on Earth and how is it visible she lines up with every single word she doesn't have her own Creeds she doesn't have her own dogmas she doesn't take some funky Spin and says well this is what the prophet said and this is what someone said the prophet said so that's why we do it this way there's no other messenger there's only one messenger and that's William Mary and branam and and the message that he brought was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and get into Jesus Christ and when he gets into you the greatest miracle that could ever take place will take place you will no longer be a cucklebur you won't be a religious person you will be a humble Christian you'll just simply believe the word of God for your day what was the Holy Ghost given for paragraph 134 brother Bram he says here some time ago we had a fire down in the city here I just love this because this puts put me in check brothers and sisters as we read this I want you to know this is my heart this is what we need in the Life in in the day in which we live we need message preachers like this he says here some time ago we had a fire down in the city here the the foul Oil Company caught on fire they had the Jefferson fire department down there and a friend of mine a good man never used to big fires like that he was walking there saying spad a little water over here sprad a little water over here here come a little Clarksville up there ding ding ding run up there and he said fire chief jumped off and said spurt a little water here knock this window here spur a little water there he says but across the river come a trained fireman from Louisville that big Hook and Ladder no more than stopped till the chief was at the end of the ladder when the ladder went up he was at the head throwed his ax before he got there and knocked the window out said come on boys that's it the fire went out in a few minutes brother Bram says not spurt a little water here spurt a little water there puts you in mind some of these intellectual ual preachers come along let's go I know it's the truth I've tasted seen the glory the Holy Ghost is right God is good don't try here and try there let's walk into him he's here it's for you God gave his power to his church am not to spurt out this here and spurt out you'll never get nothing done he says lead on Amen woo can't even see through through them no more it just makes me think I I want to I want to not be that one that's just spurred a little here spur a little there be an intellectual message minister to know all the quotes and know all about what was talked about in the message of the hour maybe where it was preached and what the year was and all of the Nostalgia that surrounds it we need to know Christ brothers and sisters but then all of that will come to life for us then we'll see wow look at the power of God de dealing with people's lives who else could discern the heart of man right amen but that's what the Holy Ghost was given for so that we could become new creatures in Christ Jesus amen so that we don't have to just be intellectual message Believers you know what happens when you become an intellectual message believer you know all the quotes and you know the Nostalgia you know all of that what happens is there's room for error you become lukewarm formal and Powerless because what you're doing is resting in the message of the hour and you know I said it before in the past and maybe I'll say it again this morning and I don't mean to upset people if you feel uncomfortable and you don't understand I don't make it clear here this morning please come and talk to me but sometimes I believe we can mistake the message of the hour for the Holy Ghost for the baptism of the Holy Ghost because I've got this understanding I've got an intellectual understanding of this message of the hour I'm saved you're not saved you're lost you've got to get into Christ but if you truly believe this message of the hour if you truly look at it and you truly have faith in your heart to mix with the word for our day brothers and sisters your heart will go right back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers it's not good enough to say that I just believe the message of the hour it won't save us it won't even give us overcoming power we'll be able to live as a good Christian for a while but then eventually Satan's got that one punch remember he's going to come and he's going to give it to us and that'll be the the knock that gets us off our rocker you know I don't know if I'm going to get into it this morning I hope I will we still have lots of time praise the Lord Brother Bram he talks about a death blow for Satan who wants to know what the death blow for Satan is wouldn't we want to know he it's actually a stroke a death stroke for Satan not a death blow that was my interpretation it just does something for me to think that we have that kind of overcoming power when we got the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters just being church members won't do it just saying that we're Associated won't do it just saying that we know won't do it we have to become a new creature in Christ Jesus when he gets a hold of our lives and begins to live out through us we change out of what was the Holy Ghost given for brother bradam not paragraph 159 oh please pleas let me persuade you my Christian brother or sister don't let this revival pass you you must receive the Holy Ghost isn't it beautiful too when we can look at this and say this isn't just for 1959 this isn't just for 1969 or 79 right or 89 or 99 or 19 this is for us today brothers and sisters amen this is exactly what we need and and I just I can hear his voice not just in my ears when I listen to it I can hear the voice of Jesus Calling to the hearts of his children oh please let me persuade you my Christian brother or sister don't let this revival pass you you must receive the Holy Ghost what is it it's the spirit of God what was it for to lead you to guide you to fill you to sanctify you to call you out into the church amen now we know he's not talking about a church Association he's talking about the mystical body of Jesus Christ the church the the the firstborn the general assembly that's that's what he's talking about there but anyways um just going on here I just want to wrap up this message and hit these high points here before we move on paragraph 163 he says my brother my sister as your brother as your servant in Christ let me persuade you as all my heart don't let this go over your head or you go or go by you or under you receive it in your heart and you'll be a happy person on Earth amen it's not about changing and going over there it's having overcoming power here brothers and sisters recognizing that we don't have to deal with the things that we have to deal with what if you could you could just know right now in your heart that when you leave this building even in this moment right now if you've got that thing in your life that you just can't get over I I would want to say this but don't raise your hands how many people would be able to raise their hand and say there's just this thing in my life brother Barry I just can't seem to get over it in my life it's a cycle I just fighted and I hate it it's always there how many people would have that in their lives I'd be one to say Amen to that but you know there is a delivering power right now you could receive deliverance from that if you want it am yes but I want to tell you clearly and I'm going to shout it you've got to want it you got to want it with everything that's inside of your heart and if you're wishy-washy about it oh I just don't know I'm not going to go that far maybe not that far you're sounded like a Holy Roller now if that's the way it is then you're going to go from here and you're still going to have that cycle we're still going to battle but you've got that overcoming power the Dynamics is right here where two or three are gathered together in his name he's there in the midst if we didn't say it this morning we declare this meeting in the name of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's here brothers and sisters we don't have to contend with these things that we contend with in our lives he says I'm not promising you get a million dollars no sir and for the people that think that there's a financial gain to get saved to get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives that's that's not the case at all I'm not I'm not promising you'll get a million dollars no sir brother Leo I think there's been too much of that promise now millions of dollars the things that different ones said if you'll be a Christian you'd get a million dollars and and you'd be a rich man I'm not promising you nothing I'm promising you this the only thing that I can promise you his salvation amen his grace is sufficient for every trial amen do you believe that this morning brothers and sisters am his grace is sufficient for every trial amen remember Paul he sought him Thrice for that one thorn in his flesh didn't he he sought him and earnestly wanted an answer for it and what did God say to him Paul so that you don't get so puffed up beyond all the Revelation that you've got about this message of the hour about being what it's like to be in Christ Jesus and to maybe have the the ability to be raised in a message home so you don't get so puffed up beyond all the Revelation that you've been given in your life you've got this thorn of your flesh and you know what it's there for a reason so that you recognize it's only by my grace that you are saved so if you've got Authority in your flesh brothers and sisters it's for a reason don't let it overcome you recognize why it's there but if you surrender it to God he'll give you the overcoming power for it amen hallelujah Lord now I want to start preaching want to get into Hebrews chapter 6 if we could go back to our scripture this morning brothers and sisters that's what the Holy Ghost is Has Come For that's what the Holy Ghost is for that's who the Holy Ghost is Christ Jesus again on Earth living out through his bride body so that she doesn't have to be slapped around by the devil and and even more so so that she doesn't have to be deceived by the devil to think that everything is okay in her life when she's really not living her life according to the word for her day that we can actually truly be saved by grace that we can truly have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what the spirit of Jesus Christ Has Come For that's what the Holy Ghost is for Hebrews chapter 6 verse one therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit so he saying let's not focus on all of this because we've done that already the church has already done that the church has already set in order let's actually take a step further and move into Perfection and you know brothers and sisters there's only one thing that's going to be perfect in this world that's Jesus Christ that's his word and that's why we say we have to have the Holy Ghost that's why brother bradam the the dispensation Prophet said you have to it's a it's it's not even negotiable you've got to have the spirit of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost living out through you you have to have his spirit it's essential for us but once we have that then let's let's just take a step further let's move into Perfection shall we I think it's beautiful and he says and this will we do if God permit in in in verse three now verse four is where we want to get into and and this is about the questions and answers on the Holy Ghost verse four for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh of upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned amen verse 9 says but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though thus we speak for God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which ye have showed toward his name and that ye have ministered to the Saints and do Minister where I'm going with this brothers and sisters is there's a question asked in this message bear with me for a second questions and answers on the the Holy Ghost preached after this these two sermons um bear with me here we go brother brandom please explain Hebrews 6: 4-6 so I read the scriptures before and after just to give us a little bit of a context just to zero it in verse four we'll just read it again for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame we know back in 1957 brother bradam I think it was in 57 or 58 one of the two he preached the indictment maybe it wasn't then uh it was later actually I think but what I'm getting at is he said in 57 they would reject they would choose to accept the word of God for their day America would or reject the word entirely and we know that that caused him to preach the indictment because what he said was indict this generation for the second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ and it just Falls right in line with the word the that we've read here that they should crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame and and I just love the way brother bradam deals with this he he goes right into detail with it he goes on in paragraph 161 the the question is brother Bram please explain Hebrews 64-6 you have it there beautiful he says that's one time it really see now you'll have to watch here on our faith Grace security of the Believers perseverance of the Saints perseverance rather of the Saints Hebrews 6 chapter 4-6 now as soon as soon as it finished this and I hope that God will help me to make it real clear to you I'm sorry I got my message for tonight maybe I'll preach the same thing paragraph 162 he says now this is a real sticker see now you have to watch now we remember now remember we believe and teach at this church not that everything comes up and shouts everything that speaks in tongues everything that shake hands with the preacher has got eternal life but we believe if you've got eternal life if God has give you eternal life you've got it forever see because look if it didn't Jesus is found a false teacher isn't that beautiful brothers and sisters if you've been given eternal life you've got it forever it can't be taken away from you if it's been given to you that's right it's a free gift of God in St John 5:24 he said he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall never come to the Judgment but has passed from Death unto life now argue with him isn't that beautiful it's just astounding that that he says it in this way just argue with him that's his word if you have passed from Death unto life you you you've got it until till the day of your Redemption it's forever nobody can change that and I would go so far as to say even ourselves even if we wanted to change it we couldn't and and maybe you would say how could that be you could look at the prophet he wanted to try and actually take his own life a couple times and somehow something wouldn't let him do that God has a way of dealing with us in our lives brothers and sisters he will always always see his will come to pass in our lives and we know those people people who maybe actually are believers and they try to fall away we know there's the story of of a Preacher I think it was brother bradam tells a story he wanted someone to go and get him a box of beer and he wouldn't do it he said no you're a preacher I will never do that that's not for you and the guy was found out doing it though drinking it brother bradam was disgusted by it by his life that he would even go and do that and what he said was that God will actually take you off the scene if you're not going to fulfill his word before you will be able to become an unbeliever amen you can't be lost brothers and sisters now I'm not saying because things get tough it is appropriate to go and take your own life don't do that a Believer won't want to do that some people might say well brother random did it I don't want to go down that rabbit hole today what I want to say is that God will never ever have his word not come to pass it will always come to pass and if you're a Believer today it's because of his grace in your life and if you're able to have that Grace it's forever amen it's not just one and done you're saved today and lost tomorrow it's not some kind of good works that you can do in St John 5:24 he said he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall never come into the Judgment but has passed from Death unto life now argue with him all the father has given me no man can come to me except the father draws him I'm quoting scripture all that comes no man can come to me except my father draws him first and all that my father has given me will come to me see and all that comes to me I'll give them everlasting life St John 6 and I will raise him up at the last days he says that's his words I think it's so important for us to remember brothers and sisters when when he has said these words they mean something the devil wants us to say well they were said for disciples somewhere or they were said for some Minister somewhere or they were said for someone else somewhere some other time no no they were said for you we have been given the ability to open the word of God to read the word of God to actually speak the word of God there's a reason for it it's so that that word can be ours today he wants to be ours today he doesn't want to be somewhere out there in the future doesn't want us to ignore him today so therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let's go on to Perfection how many want to go on to Perfection am there's no human being here on Earth that's ever going to be able to be perfect even though some think they are even so though some actually feel like they are and I'll say this even though some actually look like they are brothers and sisters they're not perfect there's no human being perfect we're all born in sin shaped in iniquity come into this world speaking lies because of the Fall In the Garden of Eden there is no perfection in mankind but oh blessed be the name of the Lord one of these days real soon this Revelation is going to take over in the lives of the he Heavenly bridegroom's bride here on Earth that Revelation is going to take over in her life and what's going to happen it's going to break Eternal bright and fair and when that happens brothers and sisters we're going to go into a Thousand-Year Millennium and that is where we will actually pick up where Adam and Eve left off where we will get a new body and we will live in this world and we won't be subject to sin because sin will still be around but for a thousand years sin will be bound the devil will be bound by ch chains of circumstance and brother brandham says not by big logging chains or the chains that hold anchors on ships but it will be bound by the chains of circumstance whereby you are now very perfect in the body in which you live can you imagine how comfortable we'll feel in our skin there how many people feel comfortable in your skin here you don't have to raise hands but many times I know as humans we have complexes we've got things in our lives where we just don't feel comfortable but we're coming to a day brothers and sisters where we're going to be the most comfortable we've ever been it's going to be absolute comfort and joy because we will display that thousand years of life where Adam and Eve messed up but that's the Perfection that we're talking about going to right now in our flesh we don't feel it but his word says that we already are how could we ever get there if his word didn't say that we will we're coming to a place which now already is brothers and sisters where you're perfect but you're only perfect in Christ Jesus our brothers and our sisters are perfect and they're perfect in Christ Jesus and when we can look at one another and see Christ Jesus and say no I don't see my brother I know that maybe he he does that thing all the time and it just it causes me such anxiety or or anger or fear whatever it is we can say you know what I know that's just that hybrid condition from the Garden of Eden that brother didn't desire to have any of those attributes even though he's prickly like a cactus you know what there's coming a time where he's going to actually lose those prickles and the more that we actually look at our brothers and sisters through the lens of the word of God through his Spirit brothers and sisters what happens I'll tell you what happens the way to deal with that in our brother and our sister is not to look at them is to look in the mirror amen go and stand in in the mirror a and sing that song just like we sang this morning why would we sing that song just so we could have the rapture we need to learn how to live with ourselves here change my heart oh God make it ever true you know what happens when we really do make that change in our lives where we start to think differently we start to speak differently we we become a new creature in Christ Jesus what happens is the brothers and sisters that used to offend they don't change maybe they do maybe they don't but what happens is we change and the more we change the more everyone can change amen but it starts right here brothers and sisters we cannot be saying Lord bring on a trial for my brother I know that he's got this problem and Oh my he needs to get over it no Lord help me get over me because when I can get over me I'll be able to be like that one to say not spur here not spurt there come on boys we're going to go put out that fire and I'm going to show you how get the Holy Ghost amen then we'll stop worrying about all of this this religious Behavior where we can have works and and and and tenure and all of this religious stuff we need to lay aside all of that and get into Christ Jesus brothers and sisters and recognize that we need the new birth Brother bradam Talks about the New Birth is a messy deal amen and if we've never had that in our lives how do we know we've had it he says that you don't just go and have a baby one day and forget that you had a baby don't worry about what other people think worry about what he thinks have I got the Holy Ghost have I truly died out to myself has he truly introduced himself to me because when that happens we're not the same person that we ever used to be we're not you know I heard someone say it recently and I thought it was really powerful and this is to the the children who are raised in a message home or or people who are raised around a message culture we can have the idea and the understanding of what it means to to to to live in a message world and and to know that God sent a prophet and we can have all the quotes and understandings in our lives but what can happen is we actually fear the punishment and we haven't actually really had a new birth with Jesus Christ the only thing we do is we live our lives afraid of the punishment so we live good lives because out of out of fear we're going to be punished one day and we're going to go to hell that's not what Christ is looking for Christ is looking for us to die out to ourselves and to actually Bear our entire selves to him so that we can have a personal relationship amen and when that happens there's a new birth that that thing that overshadows us the Holy Ghost the the power of the highest when he comes on the scene brothers and sisters and overshadows us there is a new creature that starts to grow inside our spiritual womb and boy oh boy what it does is it leaps it it comes to life it starts to express itself through us and as it does we show the world around us that we're no longer the same creatures that we used to be excuse me questions and answers on the Holy Ghost talking about this is it is it possible for someone who was once enlightened who has tasted of the Heavenly gift I'm not reading I'm just reading the scripture here brother Logan is it possible I'm just saying this for someone who was once enlightened who has tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance is it possible to do that that's the trick the devil plays on us to make us wonder is it possible because it's impossible it says the word of God says it's impossible for them to actually be renewed so what brother Bram he says is it sounds like you can have the Holy Ghost and then fall away and then once you do that what happens basically you blaspheme right at that point that's what it sounds like because we know there's only one unpardonable sin and that's blaspheming the Holy Ghost but it sounds like that's what could happen I love the way brother bradam deals with this he says and like I said last night when the Holy Ghost fell at Pentecost excuse me when they went down to the Jews acts 195 they had to lay hands on them that they receive it and when they went down to the Samaritans they had to lay hands on them but when they come to the Gentiles at cornelius's house while Peter yet spake these words no laying on of hands when when the little girl died gyrus his daughter the priest said come lay your hands on her and she'll live but when the Roman Centurian the Gentile said I'm not worthy you come under my roof and speak the word that's it amen syrop phenician Woman Greek actually what she was when Jesus said to her it's not me for to to for me to take the children's bread and give it to the dogs she said that's true Lord Lord but the dogs eat the crumbs from under the master's table he said for this saying the devil's left your daughter brother branam he says what say good things then say good things say something good about somebody talk about Jesus say something loyal something real that's the way to get rid of devils amen so I want to say this brothers and sisters as long as we're talking about someone as long as we're saying it and we know that it's not good it's in a negative context and maybe we're saying well let so that we can pray for them we want to be able to you know we can just say you know I want to pray for brother Emanuel I want to pray for brother Toby I want to pray for brother Peter we can say hey I've got unspoken requests God knows our heart we don't have to go and talk about a brother or a sister and plant those seeds of doubt now in their heart so that they can go and have those seeds of Doubt begin to grow no we got the prophet saying a real key here I think it's so important for us that's the way to get rid of devils say something loyal say something nice speak nice about our brothers and our sisters CU you know even as parents if we can go behind the bedroom door and close the door and and Whisper we can have Whispering discussion about our brother and sister and maybe slay them with our words in a whisper you know what our children are still falling under the spiritual leadership of of the home and if those devils are swirling in the home brothers and sisters don't think for a second the children are actually excluded from that maybe they can't hear our voice they don't have to because we're dealing with Devils it's a spiritual battle that we're fighting it's not principality it's not flesh that we're fighting we're not fighting our brothers and our sisters we're fighting principalities and Powers but hey if you want to know say something real that's the way to get rid of devils he never said he he he never prayed for the girl he never said one thing about her being healed did he he just said for this saying for this saying the devil's gone I just think this is so good then he goes on to say hady right the other day she didn't ask for nothing she was just sitting there but she said the right thing which pleased the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit spoke back and said Hade ask anything that you will whatever whatever you got and you want find out whether this is real or not ask anything the healing of the crippled sister sitting there all draw up 10 $110,000 to keep her from digging on the Hills over there youth restored to her well- rundown body whatever you want ask you ask it right now if it don't come true and give it to you right now then I'm a false prophet that's it that's something isn't it say something nice brothers and sisters know I'm going to tell you I'm a witness to it in multiple occasions as a Believer where I would you know be a believer come to church and believe and go home and believe and live my life as a Believer and try and do my very best as a Believer truly but still have this thing where I would just say smack talk about a brother you know this brother talked to me like that the sister or whatever like all these different things and and it's just there in the background you just drag it around like a ball and chain in your life and it's there it's a prickly nature brothers and sisters it's not Christ but you know what I found is God allowed me to get to a place where I couldn't stand the prickles anymore and this is why I'm preaching it because I've experienced it and what happened was I started to look in the mirror I didn't start looking at someone's picture and and I'll say it clearly this was a business deal and the more I talk bad about the person that we had as a customer the worst things got and it was bad and I had every right to be able to say it because it was truth this person was terrible to me this person was terrible to my wife how many husbands out there enjoy seeing someone terrible to your wife none not one hand went up amen but it makes it worse right so we have the discussion and it gets worse and we talk mad and it's truth this is the way they're behaving and one time the Lord I believe just spoke to me and said enough you want to change the situation speak nice talk like a Believer amen don't pretend don't be a false pretending believer demonstrate that you're a Believer yes sir hallu and my wife and I had a conversation and we changed our attitude and times would come we would have the regular conversations we had a business we had lots of conversations it was funny because we didn't have many marital conversations but we sure had lots of business conversations but you know what happened was we would still talk but then something would say oh remember you're not going to do this anymore and and maybe I would start talking and she would say remember we're not going to do this anymore Hallelujah it didn't just happen and everything was Rosy it took effort it took stumbling and falling and getting back up and stumbling and falling and getting back up but it became quicker and quicker between the Cycles to the place where suddenly this this person started to become friendly again in the midst of a storm in the midst of a tornado they started to actually become kind amen hallelujah and we had to have a conversation at home to say Look What the Lord Has Done say nice things I applied it in a situation in the church believe me brothers and sisters it works and you know you might not say things but you think things remember the prophet said how loud are your thoughts in heaven how loud are our thoughts in heaven he knows everyone's thought right here right now they're louder than my voice over the system brothers and sisters what do we think about our brothers and sisters what do we think about our spouses when our spouses just kick us where it hurts because nobody knows us like our spouse it's the devil it's just the devil and he knows our prickly nature we've all got him but you know what when we can take that thought into captivity after we've been prickled right in our heart right in our most innermost part where we feel like that was a low blow when when we can take that prickle into our heart and take that thought as a prickle and say you know what I'm taking that into captivity Lord and I'm going to trust you because that's what your word says now Lord I'm actually going to speak the word and trust that you'll come on the scene because I'm going to behave like that Christian I'm going to behave like a message believer I'm going to behave like someone who is filled with the Holy Ghost that Paul preached that's the person that I'm going to be and now I'm going to take that thought into captivity and I'm going to trust you Lord to change my heart in the situation and when that happens brothers and sisters I promise you that person will actually feel the impact of it the person that caused the impact that that inflicted the pain they will begin to feel it because now the person who would normally kick back who would normally punch back who would normally speak or yell back that person is actually changing it they're taking that and they're giving it to God and you know in in the case of a marriage we don't want to Heap coals fiery coals on the on the head of our spouse but that's what the word of God says if we're willing to give it over to God when our enemies come against us if we just follow the word of God what happens is they Heap coals of fire onto themselves right so when we take those thoughts from those words from those situations that happen in our lives and we just commit it to God and say Lord oh help me I love this person because we want to say I hate this person just be honest brothers and sisters there's times where we want to say that and that's the devil nature that's the hybrid condition from the Garden of Eden we all have it but when we stop saying that when we stop thinking that and we say no I don't want to do that anymore I want to have the mind of Christ Living out through me because I am a believer we can change that person we have the ability to make changes in our lives Hallelujah if you want to as Believers of this word remember we've all heard it before you've got the checkbook brother bradam he said it what is it the the the fundamentals the penny cost I'm going to get it mixed up one has the checkbook right and the other one has the bank account and one can say oh I've got all the money look at all the money that's here and the other one says yeah but I've got the checks look at the checks here but he says if you could ever get those two to come together if you could ever get that together what would happen you'd be able to write a check for whatever you want and know that you don't have to back it that he's already got it backed up brothers and sisters we have the ability to make change if we want it but remember what I I said earlier you got to want it and you really got to want it the devil knows when you're pretending the devil doesn't even know when you're serious because he's so used to our nature he thinks that it's so easy to manipulate us and slap us around spiritually but when we surrender Our Lives to Christ God knows and that's when he comes on the scene in our lives and that's where the devil starts to get a little bit shaky so don't think it strange when you start to see fiery trials in your lives when we see them in our lives our trials are worth more to us than precious gold tried in the fire so when we have a situation in our lives that we just can't overcome brothers and sisters There's an opportunity to just take that thought into captivity take that word into captivity we know there's Proverbs that speak about it as well right be be slow to speak and quick to think quick to hear rather that's the scripture be slow to speak and quick to hear you know a a soft answer does what it turns away wrath we have the ability to make an impact in our lives and it can be at work it can be at home it can be at church it can be anywhere we are we have the ability to change lives did you ever think that you could manipulate for lack of a better word you could manipulate someone else's life I I don't mean that in a negative way I mean that in a spiritually positive way you could manipulate someone unto Christ it's a stretch I know but you have the ability to do that but if we live our lives as as partial Believers where people see a half witness of Our Lives what are they going to think about us but if we always live the life of Jesus Christ even to a fault in front of our brothers and our sisters and the people that we work with the people we interact with in our lives if we always do that what's going to happen is they're going to see a witness they're going to see a real life being lived especially when we can admit that were're wrong amen totally went off Offroad here brother Ram says find out whether this is real or not ask anything the healing of her little crippled sister setting there all dra up $10,000 to keep her from digging on them Hills over there the youth restored to her rundown body whatever you want to ask you ask it now if it don't come and give you the right now then I'm a false prophet that's something isn't it Jesus said say to this mountain and you've heard about what's been taking place that's the ministry that we're entering into amen we're way up the road now soon the coming of the Lord Jesus and we've got to have rapturing faith in a church that can be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye to go out or will not go out but I just love how he underpins it he says don't but don't worry it'll be there don't worry brothers and sisters it'll be there it it'll be there and and when the power of this church Rises it'll bring its Brethren isn't that beautiful the power that that church Rises will bring its Brethren the power of that church will bring the other Brethren and there will be a general resurrection and we're looking forward to it am amen brothers and sisters I just think it's so beautiful because that resurrection and Rapture is happening right now what it is is the dynamic power of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever coming into the mechanics of the church and outside of a dispensational prophet wrapping up all the Loose Ends and taking the faith of the children and restoring it back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers outside of that happening it's it's probably not not going to happen but here we are it's already happened we can say praise the lord we already have that in our lives brother Bram please explain Hebrews 64-6 brother Bram in paragraph 162 he says now this is a real sticker see now you have to watch now remember we believe and teach at this church that not everything comes up and shouts everything that speaks in tongues everything that shake hands with the preacher has got eternal life but we got believe if you got eternal life if God has given you eternal life you've got it forever see because look if it didn't Jesus is found a false teacher in St John 5:24 he said he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall never come into the Judgment but has passed from Death unto life now argue with him all the father has given me no man can come to me except the father draws him I'm quoting scripture I'm quoting brother Bram all that comes no man can come to me except the father draws him first and all the father has given me will come to me see and all that comes to me I'll give them everlasting life St John 6 and will raise him up at the last days that's his words amen I know I read that twice I just wanted to emphasize it it's so important for us to recognize if he's called us he's made a provision for us and not one of his will be lost not one of his will be lost brothers and sisters amen and and you know I could just do the punchline right now if if you have tasted of the Heavenly gift if you have been once enlightened then you can't fall away it's impossible for you to fall away it's the people that actually were borderline Believers those are the ones that are being spoken about in this scripture here and there's a very clear distinction that I think I really want to drill down into and we're going to have to a lot next week or the next time we gather Lord willing we still have some time here so so we're going to carry on a little bit on questions and answers in the Holy Ghost paragraph 163 now look if I want to go back to Ephesians the first chapter Paul preaching now the Corinthians each one had a tongue and a Psalm you notice the other churches didn't have that trouble he never said nothing about it did he ever mention tongues anywhere in the Ephesian Church the Roman Church no I found this to be really interesting very interesting to think about it and and why is that it's because those churches were set in order they understood the word of God for their day it was the Corinthian Church that was mixed up and muddled up and had sin in the church and was busy doing their own things mixing mingling things with the word of God for their day but we know that Paul came to actually correct them and he wasn't shy about it he was pretty sharp he was pretty straight with the Corinthian Church setting them in order paragraph 164 brother Brown goes on to say and you say well what about the Pentecostals with the tongues then brother brandom I think they got the Holy Ghost he says sure they did all right why look you believe he's a good man Thomas said one time you know Lord I'm not going to continue reading it I'm going to jump down another little bit there but we'll just talk about Thomas for a second we know that he was was one of the 12 he was numbered with the apostles he never really did anything too terrible he wasn't Judas he he wasn't the son of predition but we know Thomas he was a doubter and he said the only way that I'll believe is if I can see the proof if I can see the evidence but we know Jesus said to him you know Thomas here's my side here's my hands come feel touch you can actually be that witness that you need to be to be able to believe and now you're a Believer aren't you Thomas because what you spoke is what you need to believe now it's manifest in front of you and now you can believe with all your heart and sure enough he did because he did that and said my Lord my God he cried before Jesus once he recognized how wrong he was for having that attitude but you know what pushed that aside it's interesting because there's people who are that way today that say unless I see a sign or a Wonder then I'm not going to believe brothers and sisters you're not going to believe if that's all you're looking for it'll never happen sir what you need to do is look to Christ don't look for a sign or a Wonder get the Holy Ghost in your life paragraph 165 he said yes Thomas after you've seen me and felt me and put my hand in your side hands in my side you believe but how much greater is their reward who have never seen and yet believe how many of us were with William Mariam Bram in his message message uh messages the sermons that he preached I don't know if anybody was but something inside of us gives us the ability to believe amen and it's not because we can say he was a good man it's not because that we can say he had the gift of healing in his life that he had the gift of discernment in his life we recognize by faith that that was the appearing of Jesus Christ back on Earth again because no man could perform those things he says how much greater is their reward who never had seen and yet believe he's a good God he gives you the desire of your heart of course he says let's just believe him and that's the death stroke to Satan when a man takes God at his word brother when a man takes God at his word that'll kill Satan every time that's the hardest hitting that Satan can get when a man will take God at his word yes sir to me that is just powerful that is astounding that is amazing to think that there is a death stroke for Satan and that's really where it comes down to where he will just want nothing to do with you he he won't want to mess with you because he knows he's not messing with you brothers and sisters that's the key he's not going to be messing with you he's going to be messing with Christ when Christ the Holy Ghost is living out through you but if it's you and Christ right the devil's going to come around and harass you and God will allow it God will allow those trials to come your way until you will overcome them so here we have brother Bram he's going on he says leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection now he's been out talking to them about the doctrines let's go and talk about the perfected things now you are perfected in God when you're sealed by the Holy Ghost until the day of your Redemption he that's born of God first John does not commit sin for he cannot sin for the seed of God remains in him when you are sealed into the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is sealed into you you cannot sin brothers and sisters and you know I'm probably not going to go too much further with it today I just think it's so important for us to recognize where we are today amen it's such an important thing to recognize that when you've been sealed by the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters you can't actually be unsealed by the Holy Ghost it's the devil that comes around to try and make us believe that Amen brother bradam I'm just going to read in paragraph 168 for the next few minutes I'll call the musicians brother Bram he says a man that's filled with the Holy Ghost not thinks he's filled but that he's born with the spirit of God does not commit sin for the seed of God is in him and he cannot sin see that is a real difficult thing to think about but remember what is sin brothers and sisters it's unbelief it's not believing the word of God it's not believing all the way unto adoption it's not believing all the way unto Perfection recognizing that we have nothing on our own in this flesh in this world that we see all that we can perceive with our our five outer senses and our five inner senses there's there's nothing that we can perceive that's going to actually do it for us the only thing that's going to do it is Faith and we know brother Brown Andi calls that a six sense that's that's a god sense that's something that he gives us because it's only by faith that we're saved he says the spirit of God he that's born of the spirit of God does not commit sin for the seed of God is in him and he cannot sin see does the bible say that so there it is you are not what you do what is what not what the world thinks of you it's what God thinks of you see you cannot how can I have an order written by the mayor of the city that I can run 40 miles an hour through the city and any policeman arrest me I can't how can I sin when there's a blood offering before God constantly where he can't even see me he can't even see maybe stand with me as we close today he says when there's a bumper before me and God a shield of blood for we are dead and our life is hid in Christ through God sealed by the Holy Ghost how in the world can you do anything wrong in the sight of God if we sin willfully in Hebrews 10 after we receive the knowledge of the truth there's no more sacrifice for sin in here it's impossible see to sin willfully I'm going to stop there and we will continue on next time with 169 I hope this is okay I just think it's so important brothers and sisters we need to recognize what is the Holy Ghost what the Holy Ghost was given for and to recognize that if you've ever been sealed with the Holy Ghost you can never ever be unsealed because if you've been sealed by the Holy Ghost your gods and he has claimed you for his own and that's forever there's no getting away even if we want to let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for your goodness and your mercy to us today Lord we thank you Father that we can truly have the baptism of your Holy Spirit Lord and we can have the true markers to show us whether we do or we don't and father when we do we know that we will always always always line up

greater way for you Lord that you would just allow them to do that Lord that they could lay down their life fresh once again for you on the altar this morning Lord maybe not with a physical laying down but a spiritual laying down father Lord you know our hearts you know our minds Lord Jesus we know that you're already here in this building Lord Jesus seeking who would be willing to open the door to you father that you could come in unto them Lord and Su with them and father just lead them and guide them Father Lord I pray that we could just raise our cups unto you once again Lord for
