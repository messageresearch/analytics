[12:48] see him. He'll he he'll he he'll he'll
[12:52] he'll welcome us in, but those those
[12:54] hands are nail scarred. When you think
[12:56] about the trials, I think about this
[12:57] often, how the trials that we go through
[13:00] life, you think about how tough they
[13:02] are. Just think about the fact that when
[13:04] he shakes your hand and he embraces you
[13:05] in glory. Those are with nails scarred.
[13:08] Think about the price he paid. That's
[13:10] the price that he paid for us. How could

[13:14] brother. Oh, I want to see him. Look
[13:22] upon his face.
[13:26] Oh, there to sing
[13:30] forever of his saving
[13:35] grace on the streets of
[13:39] glory. Let me lift my

[19:52] to brother Don. I many of you know of
[19:55] course those of you that come here often
[19:57] you know that brother Don's got quite a
[19:58] gift of poetry and he just had something
[20:01] come on his heart I just saw the post
[20:03] this week and some of the sisters were
[20:05] asking about a prayer and he just
[20:06] created a poem like that's an incredible
[20:09] incredible gift and it's not just poem
[20:10] it can be put to music as well but Don's
[20:13] got a poem for us or a an encouragement
[20:16] I'll say it that way and then the older
[20:17] lean sisters you have a special if you
[20:18] come right after God bless
[20:21] [Music]
[20:23] Amen. I wasn't going to read this today,
[20:26] but the last couple weeks it's been on
[20:28] my heart. Once I got in the
[20:31] sanctuary, I just felt led to read it.
[20:34] It's called the word in my boots. And we
[20:36] know the prophet taught us the Holy
[20:38] Ghost is the action of the word in us.
[20:42] I was driving slow that evening, my
[20:45] heart heavy, my mind wide, turning over
[20:48] verses from the good book that provoked
[20:51] me deep
[20:52] inside. See, I'd read a line that lit me
[20:55] up like fire in my chest. Revelation
[20:58] ain't just knowledge. It's faith that's
[21:01] walked and dressed. Now, that got me
[21:04] thinking hard, friend, about a fellow I
[21:07] once knew. He talked real deep about
[21:10] scripture.
[21:11] quoted Paul and Moses too. He said the
[21:14] word had been revealed. The scrolls had
[21:17] lost their seal. But somehow in his
[21:20] daily life and never quite turned real.
[21:25] He preached about the glory, about the
[21:27] mysteries up above. Yet in his house,
[21:31] his family shivered, not from the cold,
[21:34] but from lack of love. He knew the
[21:37] truth. He spoke it loud but never let it
[21:40] live. He held the fire close enough to
[21:43] warm but never let it give. Now don't
[21:46] get me wrong, I ain't judging. Lord
[21:49] knows it's me I'm referring to cuz faith
[21:52] and revelation,
[21:54] friend, they ain't just things we view.
[21:57] It's not enough to see the light or hear
[22:00] that still small voice. The power comes
[22:03] and live in it. That's when you make the
[22:05] choice. Because revelation brings a
[22:08] cross, not just a shout or
[22:11] song. And if you see it but will not do,
[22:14] you're walking dead and wrong. To know
[22:17] his name but not his way. To speak but
[22:20] never show. That's like a field that's
[22:22] never plowed. Where nothing good can
[22:25] grow. I guess what I'm trying to say. If
[22:29] he's lit up your soul, don't just sit
[22:31] there glowing.
[22:33] Start walking toward the goal. Let the
[22:36] word become your footsteps. Let his
[22:38] voice become your breath. Because living
[22:40] truth is what he meant from manger unto
[22:43] death. Now I'm checking my heart each
[22:46] time I read these books. Not just to
[22:49] gain a quote or two, but take a deeper
[22:51] look. Do I love like he has loved me? Do
[22:55] I walk how he has bled?
[22:58] If the word is truly in me, it ought to
[23:01] be how I'm led.
[23:03] And if someday they lay me down and
[23:06] folks stand up to speak, I don't need
[23:08] him saying he knew much. Or boy, he sure
[23:11] could preach. Just let him say he lived
[23:14] it out. That light he used to talk. He
[23:17] wasn't just a man who heard. He let the
[23:20] word simply walk. Lord bless you.
[23:24] [Applause]
[23:32] Thank you, brother Don. Thank you,
[23:34] brother Don. Sisters, would you come
[24:04] [Music]
[24:24] I thank the Lord for my
[24:30] blessings for all the ways he has kept
[24:34] me.
[24:36] Oh, I can't
[24:39] forget how
[24:41] he
[24:45] soul. Praise the Lord.
[24:51] I thank the Lord. He is
[24:57] faithful and alone. He is
[25:01] faithful.
[25:04] Oh, I was alone. Well, he opened up the
[25:09] door. I found a
[25:11] reason to praise the
[25:14] Lord. He woke me. Woke me up this
[25:19] morning. A testimony. Gave me a
[25:22] testimony. I've got a reason. I've got a

[26:24] anchor. And through the rain is my
[26:28] shelter.
[26:31] Oh, when trouble comes, I can rest in
[26:35] the storm. I've got a reason to praise
[26:41] the Lord. Cuz he woke me up. Say, woke

[30:36] that clay clay that wet clay and the

[38:39] You know when I was in
[38:41] Jerusalem is just a small
[38:44] city and at
[38:48] midnight there was a thousand of people
[38:50] with
[38:51] kids going to worship
[38:54] God one day and this is
[38:59] soon the song we singing today it will
[39:03] be a reality our
[39:06] lifeal Hallelujah. Yes.
[39:10] That will be the end of everything.
[39:13] I always say that. I always say that in
[39:16] this world we need
[39:18] money. We need
[39:20] it. You can say don't think about that.
[39:24] You will need
[39:25] it. And brother and sister, you need a
[39:30] car or you need a houses. We are not a
[39:35] Lazarus who was begging
[39:40] money who was
[39:42] homeless
[39:44] but he was in
[39:47] heaven and on this world you need God
[39:51] grace before to

[39:58] Zion. Let's pray otherwise I I will go
[40:02] over
[40:03] already. My goodness. Let's bow our head
[40:06] and
[40:08] pray. Father God, creator of heaven and
[40:11] earth. Before to open the book and read
[40:14] it, we come to you the author of the
[40:17] everything.
[40:19] Father bless the service
[40:21] as we
[40:23] approach to celebrating your
[40:26] life before to cross the other side and
[40:31] to be in Zion
[40:34] and to spend time and eternity with
[40:38] you. Bless the
[40:40] service. Bless our pastor and bless
[40:44] everyone in this church. Even those who
[40:47] are online, bless them in Jesus
[40:51] name. Amen. God bless you. God bless all
[40:56] the
[40:57] [Music]
[40:58] musician. May you seat please.
[41:09] I'll give first the announcement before
[41:11] I go move on on my
[41:14] preaching. Last time I was going in my
[41:19] car and I was singing in my
[41:24] car and later
[41:26] on there was no more space in my car
[41:29] anymore to sing and to
[41:33] dance. I said, "Lord, I'm stacking now.
[41:35] I was singing in my car and I stopped
[41:38] the car on the road." I know if you
[41:42] maybe you can see it on YouTube or
[41:43] somewhere. I don't know. Because I
[41:45] stopped my car on the road and I went
[41:48] out of the car and I start
[41:51] dancing. I said, "Lord, in the car, I
[41:54] don't have more space. So, I need to go
[41:57] out, get out of my car and start dancing
[41:59] for you."
[42:01] Sometimes happen in your
[42:03] life. Sometime in the
[42:07] church something's telling you stand up
[42:11] and dance and you you you
[42:14] hesitate that is you miss your
[42:18] blessing. And I was going at
[42:21] work in the parking
[42:24] area. I was so exciting about the grace
[42:28] of God.
[42:29] I just get out of the car and I start
[42:32] dancing. People were sad watching me.
[42:35] They say, "What's happening to you?" I
[42:37] say, "I'm just feeling
[42:38] good." Because we we we going soon.
[42:44] One day we will stop thinking about
[42:47] everything on this world.
[42:49] One day and it's coming soon.
[42:54] Okay, let me give the announcement
[42:55] before I go. I'm already in my
[42:58] preaching.
[43:00] So, so greeting from pastor Barry
[43:03] Johnson, our pastor who is now in
[43:05] Edmonton. So, he told me to greet all
[43:08] the saint in Calgary living with
[43:10] Assembly. Did you accept it?
[43:16] Come on.
[43:18] Your pastor, brother Barry Johnson, is
[43:22] sending you a greeting and you say,
[43:27] Thank
[43:28] you. Is there any visitor
[43:31] today? Brother or sister who come for
[43:33] the first time to visit
[43:36] us?
[43:39] Anyone? We have some
[43:41] visitors. Can I see your hand please?
[43:44] Cuz I didn't see you. Oh, God bless you.
[43:47] God bless you. Welcome to the house of
[43:49] the
[43:51] Lords. So, Phil, welcome. This is your
[43:54] house.
[43:56] You see this place is called the house
[43:59] of the Lord. Brother Barry have his own
[44:03] house. So we have our own houses. But
[44:06] this place is a house of the Lord. So is
[44:10] a house of your father. Feel free. If
[44:13] you want to jump jump, don't forget to
[44:16] say amen of the word.
[44:21] So if there's anyone else who want to be
[44:24] baptized in the water or in the Holy
[44:28] Ghost, is there anyone who want to be
[44:30] baptized in the
[44:31] water or someone want to be baptized
[44:34] with Holy
[44:35] Ghost? Because if you are not baptized
[44:38] with the Holy Ghost, you not going to go
[44:40] to
[44:41] heaven. Forget about heaven. Because
[44:44] there's a difference to John the church
[44:47] and to John the body of Christ.
[44:52] Coming to the church that is doesn't
[44:54] mean you are in the body of Christ. So
[44:57] make sure you join the body of Christ by
[45:01] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. There you
[45:04] are candidate for heaven.
[45:08] And the last
[45:10] one, there's a service to change the
[45:13] windows. So there's a changing windows
[45:16] services. It will happen on Thursday
[45:19] 22nd and Friday 23rd this week. So we
[45:23] need brother and
[45:25] sister if you are you are available to
[45:28] come to help for the service. So you
[45:31] would like to I would like to brother
[45:34] Paul can you stand up so people can see
[45:36] you? No help for that. So you are
[45:40] good. Oh, on June 14. So sorry, my
[45:44] apologize. So it was not
[45:48] on this Friday, but June 14th. Okay. So
[45:52] you don't need help. You're
[45:55] good. Okay. God bless
[46:00] you. I think this is was the
[46:03] announcement. I will go straight away in
[46:06] the words. So could you stand up so we
[46:09] can read the words of
[46:19] God. Let's take the book of St. Luke
[46:22] chapter
[46:24] 24 verse 13-
[46:31] 27. Are you there?
[46:36] How many people have a
[46:43] Bible? I'm talking about the
[46:47] Bible. Okay. How many people have a
[46:51] phone with a Bible
[46:57] inside?
[46:58] Okay, let's read. Brother, can you put
[47:02] it on there? So everybody can
[47:07] see. And
[47:10] behold, two of them went that same day
[47:13] to the village called Emus, which was
[47:16] from Jerusalem about the three score
[47:21] follow everybody's
[47:24] there.
[47:26] 14th and they talking together of all
[47:29] these things which has happened. And it
[47:32] came to pass that where they commun
[47:35] together and resigning, Jesus
[47:39] himself, did you
[47:44] notice Jesus
[47:47] himself, the one who was with
[47:51] them few days
[47:58] ago, draw near and went with them. But
[48:03] their eyes were ordered that they should
[48:06] not know
[48:08] him. And he said unto them, What manner
[48:13] of communication are this day he have
[48:16] one to another, and she walk and has
[48:19] sat? And the one of them whose name was
[48:22] Cropas answering said unto him, "Ha died
[48:27] only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hence
[48:31] not knowing the things which shall come
[48:33] to pass this
[48:36] days. He's talking to Jesus. He's
[48:39] talking to his
[48:40] master. He's talking to the one who was
[48:43] preaching them. Is like a me." Okay, how
[48:47] many people know about me?
[48:51] Okay. So, can you miss my face after 3
[48:54] days? Can you forget about me after 3
[48:58] days? But they forget about
[49:01] Jesus after 3 days
[49:06] only. 19th and he said unto them, "What
[49:11] things?"
[49:13] And they answer, they say unto him
[49:15] concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was
[49:19] a prophet mighty indeed, and word before
[49:23] God and all the people, and now the
[49:26] chief priests and our rulers deliver him
[49:29] to the to be condemned to death, and
[49:32] have crucified him. But we trust we we
[49:40] trust that he has be the which should
[49:43] have redeem Israel. And beside all
[49:48] this, today is the third day since these
[49:51] things was done. Yeah. A certain woman
[49:56] also always human. So I didn't say happy
[49:59] woman days to you. So this is my day
[50:01] now. So happy woman's days.
[50:07] Yeah. A certain woman also of our
[50:10] company made
[50:13] astonish at the sepulra. And when they
[50:17] found not his body, they come saying
[50:20] that he has also seen a vision of angels
[50:24] which say that he was alive. And certain
[50:28] of them which was with him with us went
[50:31] to the sea and found him. it even so as
[50:35] the woman had say, but him they saw
[50:39] not. Then he said unto them, "Oh foolish
[50:45] and slow of heart to believe all that
[50:48] the prophet has
[50:49] spoken, heart not Christ to have to
[50:52] suffer these things and to enter into
[50:55] his glory?" and beginning at Moses and
[51:00] all the
[51:01] prophets is export unto them in all the
[51:05] scripture that things concerning
[51:17] himself. They were with
[51:19] Jesus. They talked to
[51:22] him. They was a disciple of Jesus
[51:25] Christ. But they forget about
[51:29] Jesus. Let God bless the words. Maybe
[51:33] you see
[51:39] it. This is what's always happening in
[51:43] the
[51:45] world. When you talking about
[51:48] Jesus, he will come. Even when you
[51:52] thinking about Jesus, he will come.
[51:58] But listen to this
[52:03] one.
[52:07] Now if I can call my subject I will call
[52:10] it the modern
[52:13] events are made clear by
[52:19] prophecy. Modern events are made clear
[52:23] by prophecy.
[52:26] Now it's always be God's and changing
[52:31] and changing
[52:32] God's let his people know before certain
[52:35] events happen. So this is the way God's
[52:39] always deal with his
[52:42] people is always give a
[52:45] prophecy always tell people in advance
[52:49] what can happen in few days in the
[52:52] future. So people of God will prepare
[52:55] themsel to wait until that prophecy will
[52:59] be
[53:02] fulfilled. If these
[53:05] people, people of Jerusalem, if they
[53:09] knew that
[53:10] Jesus was God's, they will never kill
[53:14] him.
[53:17] Modern
[53:20] events are
[53:22] made clear by the prophecy.
[53:27] Sometimes things happening in the world
[53:30] and we think it's just normal things and
[53:33] we say it's okay Trump you want to
[53:35] change Canada to become a 51 state of
[53:38] United States of America and people say
[53:41] some people okay I don't I don't I don't
[53:44] accusing someone so
[53:46] yeah are you with me
[53:49] yeah cuz I remember sometime ago there
[53:53] was a people from FBI and the CA they
[53:55] come to Calgary and look it for me
[53:57] because I give them what the Lord
[54:01] says. For six months they was checking
[54:04] for me and they found my place and they
[54:07] saw me and they was checking with me. So
[54:10] I knew that those people come from FBI
[54:12] and CA. So I was quiet because I didn't
[54:15] do something wrong. I just tell them
[54:18] what say the Lord.
[54:20] That's
[54:22] all. And I don't care but people so some
[54:26] people
[54:27] agree that Canada will become the 51
[54:31] state of United States of
[54:33] America and there was a
[54:36] fight. I saw when President Trump say
[54:39] about that everybody all the premier
[54:42] they went to Washington DC they was on
[54:44] the line waiting for the meeting. I say
[54:48] we need to thank God for the prophet we
[54:55] have. What I read is in the
[54:59] Bible is a story. It's not something
[55:03] extraordinary. No, it was a normal
[55:05] things events in the
[55:08] city. Jesus was not the first person to
[55:11] be crucified. No, there was people
[55:14] crucified before Jesus.
[55:18] He was not the only
[55:22] one. Brother Baram say, let me read it
[55:25] quickly. Modern events are made clear by
[55:29] prophecy.
[55:31] 61206. Okay, let me
[55:35] start
[55:37] 17. Brother, do you get
[55:39] it? Okay, let me go on.
[55:44] 651206 modern events are made clear by
[55:48] prophecy. Now I take I call subjects I
[55:52] like to take this the
[55:55] events modern events are made clear by
[55:58] prophecy. Now it always be God's the
[56:02] unchangeable unchanging God's way to let
[56:05] his people fall before certain events
[56:09] happen.
[56:12] If the people in that day of the Lord
[56:15] Jesus have only sound gods and knowing
[56:19] what was just about to take place, they
[56:22] will not have condemn Jesus to death.
[56:27] But the reason was because you see the
[56:31] reason why they killed Jesus. They
[56:35] didn't know that that was a plan. That
[56:38] was a prophecy that was already make by
[56:42] God. They didn't know
[56:44] that. But the reason of why they killed
[56:49] Jesus because the scripture has to be
[56:53] filled because the Jews had to be blind.
[56:57] We all are aware of
[57:00] that. 19. Do you realize that promise
[57:05] again in this very age that we're living
[57:09] the loud age church age the seventh
[57:12] church age that we we are in now we in
[57:18] 2025 we are in
[57:21] now the same as blinding them back there
[57:27] for the purpose of getting his message
[57:29] through to the elected
[57:32] people is promised to do the same thing
[57:38] today. Is doing the same thing
[57:43] today. Is doing the same things
[57:49] today. Brother Brham
[57:51] say when they reading the Bible, you
[57:55] have to say
[57:58] amen.
[58:01] Because the spirit of God in you, he
[58:05] will push you to say amen to the
[58:10] words. The spirit of God in you will
[58:14] push you to say amen to the words.
[58:18] And when we reading also brother Brham
[58:21] the same spirits will tell you to
[58:27] say
[58:29] 20 same preaching and if I say this true
[58:34] respect to all the brethren and sister
[58:36] in Christ one of these days somebody
[58:41] going to say isn't it written that
[58:43] things should happen
[58:45] first the thing I show you today people
[58:49] will say that later it was
[58:54] written someone talk already about that
[58:57] we didn't know that but there will not
[59:00] going to be any
[59:02] excuse even for our government in
[59:06] Canada even to United States of America
[59:09] myself I send them a
[59:12] message that's why they CA and FBI to
[59:15] check about me to check who is this guy.
[59:18] I sent them a message to tell them what
[59:21] do you see today in your country my
[59:25] prophets my prophets you already say
[59:29] that these things will
[59:37] happen
[59:39] 21 and it will be the same way it was
[59:43] then verily I say unto you is already
[59:48] come and they have did what they
[59:51] listened to
[59:53] him when they ask him. They ask
[59:57] Jesus say why the scribes say and the
[1:00:02] scripture say that Eliah must come first
[1:00:06] they say that to Jesus. Do you remember
[1:00:10] that? Do you remember that?
[1:00:13] Okay.
[1:00:15] 24. Now we went to post. Oh no no no let
[1:00:19] me go to
[1:00:20] 23. He said he's already come and you
[1:00:24] didn't know him. See in that per the way
[1:00:28] is still hands up to
[1:00:32] again. So the same thing happened to
[1:00:36] Jesus. They said to him but Jesus you
[1:00:39] you
[1:00:40] say that you are the Messiah.
[1:00:44] We know that before the messiah
[1:00:48] come, Elijah must come
[1:00:51] first. That is the scriptures never
[1:00:54] change. The prophecy never
[1:00:57] change. If you are the Messiah, before
[1:01:00] you come to this
[1:01:02] place, Elijah the prophet must come
[1:01:06] first before
[1:01:07] you. And Jesus said to
[1:01:10] them, that is true. is the prophecy and
[1:01:14] is
[1:01:15] true. But Elijah was with you guys. He
[1:01:20] was here. You kill
[1:01:22] him. You kill Elijah. The one you was
[1:01:26] waiting
[1:01:27] for. And you asking me if I'm a messiah.
[1:01:31] I
[1:01:32] am. And the one you guys was waiting
[1:01:35] for, his name was
[1:01:37] not Elijah. He was a John.
[1:01:42] just the name was
[1:01:44] changed and today brother Bam say it's
[1:01:48] happening
[1:01:50] again brother give me a picture the
[1:01:52] first one I want to talk about my
[1:01:56] preaching is the events the modern
[1:02:00] events are made clear by the prophecy so
[1:02:05] there's a two
[1:02:07] things no no the first
[1:02:10] one. This is the second one. Go to the
[1:02:13] first one. Yes. Thank
[1:02:19] you. First of all, we need to know the
[1:02:22] different there's the events modern
[1:02:25] events means the normal things happening
[1:02:28] in the city or things happening in the
[1:02:31] world. It's a events and we take it
[1:02:34] normals. It's a part of life.
[1:02:38] It was the same thing happened in the
[1:02:40] time of Jesus when they killed Jesus. It
[1:02:43] was a it's not something special. It was
[1:02:45] a normal things. They know this guy was
[1:02:48] making trouble in the city so kill him.
[1:02:51] That was over. End of story. And for
[1:02:55] them was normal things events. It was a
[1:02:59] model events in the
[1:03:01] city. But there's a second
[1:03:04] part that
[1:03:06] events can be
[1:03:09] maybe be made clear by the prophecy. So
[1:03:13] any events in the city or in the world
[1:03:17] we need to go to check what our prophet
[1:03:23] say. When Kamala Aris she become a vice
[1:03:28] president. By the way, before that there
[1:03:31] was
[1:03:32] a I think everybody knows about the man
[1:03:36] Martin Luther King Jr. in US. How many
[1:03:40] people know about the guy? Thank you.
[1:03:43] Because they even teach us at
[1:03:46] school. He say I have a
[1:03:49] dream. They ask him why. There was a big
[1:03:52] speech that is the most big speech in
[1:03:54] the United States of Martin.
[1:03:58] I have a dream. They say what dream? I
[1:04:02] dream that whites and black people will
[1:04:05] come together in this country. They say
[1:04:09] okay you're
[1:04:10] dreaming. And he said the second
[1:04:13] thing I saw a black man in the white
[1:04:17] house as a president. They said forget
[1:04:20] about
[1:04:21] that. We can come together but to be a
[1:04:24] president forget about that.
[1:04:27] One
[1:04:29] day this man called
[1:04:31] Obama become the first black president
[1:04:36] in United States of
[1:04:38] America. That's why make Obama
[1:04:41] popular because that was a dream of a
[1:04:45] black leader. He become true in this in
[1:04:48] the
[1:04:49] country. But we in the
[1:04:54] message we we went to check because this
[1:04:58] is the
[1:05:00] Bible. This is the
[1:05:02] message. You see here is the
[1:05:05] message. You don't have access to
[1:05:07] internet on this one. Nothing. Only the
[1:05:12] message. This is the Bible.
[1:05:16] So
[1:05:17] when this beautiful lady Kamala Aris
[1:05:21] become a vice president, we took the
[1:05:26] Bible and we went to check what the
[1:05:29] Bible say about this lady.
[1:05:32] We check there was a
[1:05:35] nothing nothing I say nothing in the
[1:05:38] Bible about Kamala
[1:05:41] Aris. We put it on this
[1:05:46] side. We went to the
[1:05:49] message preached by the prophet of God
[1:05:52] William Mariam Brham.
[1:05:55] We say is there anything about this lady
[1:05:59] in the
[1:06:02] message? This is the news. This is the
[1:06:05] modern events in the news. United States
[1:06:09] of
[1:06:11] America. Why Vice President Kamala Aris
[1:06:14] Royal Purple inauguration day of lift is
[1:06:17] symbolic to many. Aris honoring rise
[1:06:21] black fashion designer Christopher John
[1:06:23] Rogers for his for her history making
[1:06:26] moment in Capitol
[1:06:28] Hill. This is a normal story. It's on
[1:06:32] the
[1:06:33] news. So people will see but what is the
[1:06:37] manner with this with the message or
[1:06:40] with the Bible?
[1:06:42] We say
[1:06:45] okay we want to check that is our
[1:06:49] responsibility to
[1:06:51] check if these events the modern
[1:06:55] events it's made clear by the
[1:07:00] prophecy our responsibility we need to
[1:07:04] check there was a brother called me for
[1:07:06] United States he said brother
[1:07:08] Joshua did you see on the news I say yes
[1:07:11] sir
[1:07:12] What do you think? I said I don't think
[1:07:17] anything. I don't think anything.
[1:07:21] But I went to
[1:07:23] check in the message of William Maro
[1:07:27] Brown. What is he
[1:07:29] saying? You see this picture
[1:07:32] here? Is anything here about the Bible
[1:07:35] verse? Anything here? No.
[1:07:39] Is there anything with the message of
[1:07:41] the
[1:07:42] hour?
[1:07:44] No. So we went to check now what the
[1:07:47] prophet of God say. That is where the
[1:07:50] beginning of the problem
[1:07:53] starts. Brother, give me a
[1:07:56] quote. Now we starting the
[1:08:01] preaching. What the prophet of God say
[1:08:04] the 70th week of
[1:08:07] Daniel. You saw the picture
[1:08:09] correct that was in the
[1:08:12] news. But what the prophet now say and
[1:08:17] that day as you see the picture Kamala
[1:08:20] Aris she want she want us to honor the
[1:08:23] black community. That's all she say. I
[1:08:26] always dress with
[1:08:27] pants like a Jezebel, but today I want
[1:08:32] to make something different to be royal
[1:08:35] lady. And Kamala Harris, she's not fun
[1:08:39] with a purple color. No, she always wear
[1:08:43] black or uh brown. That is her color.
[1:08:47] But on that day, she said, "Today is
[1:08:50] inauguration of my my my my position. To
[1:08:54] get my position as a vice president, I
[1:08:56] need to dress nicely to honor uh
[1:09:00] Rogers." Uh to dress nicely like a royal
[1:09:03] lady, to be like a
[1:09:06] queen. They ask her, "What color you
[1:09:09] need?" She said, "Purp." She didn't know
[1:09:12] anything, nothing.
[1:09:18] This message is a
[1:09:21] true before even Kamala Irish because
[1:09:24] she's born uh in 19
[1:09:28] 1960. This prophecy it was made
[1:09:35] in
[1:09:36] 61
[1:09:40] 0806. This is what brother Brham now
[1:09:43] say.
[1:09:45] Listen
[1:09:48] now. I predict and have say I saw a
[1:09:53] great woman stand up beautiful looking.
[1:09:58] She's not
[1:09:59] beautiful. She's not
[1:10:02] beautiful. Don't be scared. Your brother
[1:10:04] not going to do anything.
[1:10:06] So she's blurry beautiful looking. By
[1:10:10] the way, by the way, before I before I
[1:10:12] forget, brother, I was so excited when I
[1:10:15] get the news for my sister. I was
[1:10:18] telling brother Emmanuel, forget about
[1:10:20] all the three, they are
[1:10:22] going. Not only one, they are going.
[1:10:28] Amen.
[1:10:32] We always pray. We want to see them to
[1:10:34] get buried. And some brother and sister
[1:10:37] also on this place. But brother wake up.
[1:10:40] They are
[1:10:47] going. The thing you are looking for
[1:10:49] first of all the sister must be filled
[1:10:52] with the Holy Ghost. They have the Holy
[1:10:53] Spirit here. My sisters here. Where's
[1:10:56] that other sister? She going to I think
[1:10:57] to
[1:10:58] German. There was a sister supposed to
[1:11:00] go to German somewhere in Europe.
[1:11:08] Where? To Ghana for a wedding. You see
[1:11:11] another one. She's
[1:11:14] gone. Brother, wake up. You need someone
[1:11:18] with the Holy Spirit. They have a Holy
[1:11:20] Spirit. Okay. One more
[1:11:23] thing. You want someone to look nice.
[1:11:26] They are beautiful.
[1:11:32] Oh, they are going brothers.
[1:11:38] You will be late when you start praying.
[1:11:40] The Lord say there was here you miss
[1:11:43] her. That was the one I prepared for
[1:11:45] your life. The one you will
[1:11:48] take. Okay. I I don't know
[1:11:55] what I saw a great woman stand up
[1:11:59] beautiful looking dressing in real
[1:12:03] highly royal like
[1:12:08] what and I got little paradise down
[1:12:12] here. She was a great ruler in the
[1:12:15] United States. Prefer the Catholic
[1:12:17] Church. A woman, some woman. I don't
[1:12:21] know. It still be the Catholic Church. I
[1:12:24] don't know. I can I can't say. Only
[1:12:27] thing I see I see a woman that was
[1:12:34] whole. How can someone already pass
[1:12:38] away? Can you imagine? Someone was
[1:12:42] prophesized with dict of
[1:12:45] dressing. She say she was look
[1:12:50] beautiful dressing in
[1:12:52] [Music]
[1:12:55] purple and for for many people it was
[1:12:58] just
[1:12:59] normal for us. When we check the message
[1:13:04] brother say it will happen.
[1:13:08] This thing become clear by
[1:13:12] prophecy. Someone said to me, "Brother
[1:13:15] Joshua, that is not the exactly what
[1:13:19] brother said it's happened. It's just
[1:13:22] she's just the vice president. She's
[1:13:25] nothing else." I say, "Brother, when
[1:13:28] brother say
[1:13:30] something that will be
[1:13:34] faithful, it will come true. It doesn't
[1:13:37] matter how long will take. They say,
[1:13:38] "No, no, no, no. She's just a vice
[1:13:42] president." I say, "Okay, brother, give
[1:13:45] me the second
[1:13:49] picture." People will say, "Brother
[1:13:50] Joshua, you the one who make it." No, I
[1:13:52] didn't make any
[1:13:54] pictures. This is from the
[1:13:58] news. The news called the 19th United
[1:14:02] States of America.
[1:14:05] Kamala Harris is the first woman to
[1:14:08] officially be acting US
[1:14:12] president. They didn't say vice
[1:14:14] president. US
[1:14:17] president. Before I go home, when John
[1:14:22] Biden was a president in United States,
[1:14:24] they traveling with President Trump in
[1:14:27] Paris.
[1:14:29] Trump was already elected president but
[1:14:32] in office he was a John Biden when they
[1:14:35] arrived from the white house you are not
[1:14:38] allowed to take the air force one if you
[1:14:40] are not the
[1:14:42] president when the president reach the
[1:14:45] air force one that's the that is the
[1:14:48] time that plane become a air force
[1:14:53] one this news they say President John
[1:14:58] Biden briefly transfer power to the vice
[1:15:02] president Aris while he was under
[1:15:07] anesthesia. In the United States there
[1:15:09] is a
[1:15:11] law when the president is sick or is not
[1:15:15] able anymore to do that his office he
[1:15:19] will transfer the power to the vice
[1:15:22] president.
[1:15:26] Kam Harris was just the vice president.
[1:15:28] Like the brother said to me, "Brother
[1:15:30] Joshua, you taking brother Brandham like
[1:15:32] I don't know you you you're talking more
[1:15:33] about brother Brham and you I said I'm
[1:15:36] not talking about the brother. I'm
[1:15:38] reading. That is my problem."
[1:15:42] Reading. It's not I say, it's he
[1:15:47] say. This is the news. Look at this
[1:15:51] part. The 25th amendment has made the
[1:15:53] temporary transfer of power to vice
[1:15:56] presidents and more routine and office
[1:16:00] official offer. George
[1:16:03] WW and I'm
[1:16:05] going until
[1:16:07] Yeah. Aris was acting president for 1
[1:16:11] hour and 25 minutes. The White House
[1:16:17] say for one hour 25
[1:16:20] minutes that lady become the first
[1:16:24] black president of United States of
[1:16:28] America.
[1:16:29] Everything it was under her control. If
[1:16:33] she say yes it's yes. That's when you
[1:16:36] say when President Trump he said from
[1:16:39] now 25% everywhere was a trouble because
[1:16:44] he's a woman president of United
[1:16:47] States. So Kamala become the first woman
[1:16:52] president in United States of
[1:16:55] America for the news. It's normal is a
[1:16:59] events. It's normal events. Nothing
[1:17:01] change. So it's a part of life. It's a
[1:17:04] part of
[1:17:05] administration. But we believe all the
[1:17:08] message.
[1:17:11] We went
[1:17:13] again in the message to check why Kamala
[1:17:18] Aris she was a vice president and now
[1:17:22] she acting as a president of United
[1:17:25] States of
[1:17:26] America what the prophet say about
[1:17:30] that brother but give me a quote let's
[1:17:33] go to from that
[1:17:35] [Music]
[1:17:37] time what the prophet
[1:17:41] Okay.
[1:17:43] 16716 paragraph
[1:17:46] 23. What the prophet of God say about
[1:17:50] that.
[1:18:03] from that
[1:18:04] time
[1:18:07] 60716
[1:18:09] 213. This is what the prophet
[1:18:12] say. And
[1:18:14] so did you get
[1:18:19] it from that
[1:18:22] time 60 0716 paragraph 1
[1:18:29] 213 and so I won't have time in this
[1:18:33] meeting to tell you in
[1:18:36] 1933 did you hear
[1:18:38] that 1933
[1:18:45] Three. This is a woman's
[1:18:49] nations is the number 13 in appear in
[1:18:52] the 13th chapter of
[1:18:55] Revelation. This is brother
[1:18:57] Brham. 13 star 13 strip 13 everything is
[1:19:01] 13. Everything is human. And
[1:19:06] remember, thou saith the
[1:19:09] Lord. I think you will say amen.
[1:19:14] Thus sayaith the Lord. That mean is not
[1:19:19] Brham is the
[1:19:21] Lord who push Kamala to dress in pop on
[1:19:25] that day.
[1:19:29] is gods who push the government to be
[1:19:32] sick, the presidents to be sick and to
[1:19:36] transfer the power to that lady just to
[1:19:39] make this prophecy to be
[1:19:42] fulfilled. Thus sayith the
[1:19:46] Lord, there will be a woman ruler before
[1:19:50] the end of time. She will either be
[1:19:54] president, vice president
[1:19:58] or okay I want to make it clear here
[1:20:00] just stop brother stop here okay the
[1:20:03] lord they that says the lord there will
[1:20:07] be a woman ruler before the end time
[1:20:11] she'll either be president vigor vice
[1:20:16] president vigor
[1:20:18] or it be the catholic age as a woman. I
[1:20:23] see
[1:20:25] her a great woman. The nation power to
[1:20:30] her. It will be one before the end time.
[1:20:35] Thus say the
[1:20:37] Lord. Write it down and find out. You
[1:20:42] young
[1:20:44] people. 1933.
[1:20:50] Did you catch me?
[1:20:54] 1933. This is the prophecy. And she he
[1:20:58] say that say the
[1:21:01] Lord. You young people see if is not if
[1:21:06] it happen if his needs I am a false
[1:21:13] prophet. So if this lady not become a
[1:21:17] president of United States of America.
[1:21:19] Branam is a false
[1:21:24] prophet and he said this is th sayeth
[1:21:27] the
[1:21:33] lord. Let me jump to another one. This
[1:21:36] is was what say about kamala aris. It
[1:21:40] was a part of his story. It was a part
[1:21:44] of news. So we saw the news and we know
[1:21:46] that no more is the events modern events
[1:21:51] in the world but this become clear by
[1:21:54] the
[1:21:57] prophecy only the prophecy can make
[1:21:59] things clear. So now you understand that
[1:22:03] was said the
[1:22:06] lord that is a privilege we have in the
[1:22:09] message. Anything can happen in the
[1:22:12] world. If we check, we will know exactly
[1:22:16] what is the meaning of
[1:22:19] that. I saw the President Trump dressing
[1:22:23] in po in in
[1:22:26] pop.
[1:22:27] Brother, give me the picture. I want to
[1:22:30] talk with picture today. I don't want
[1:22:32] FBI to follow me again. So if they they
[1:22:36] found the video, it's not me. Everything
[1:22:38] is here.
[1:22:43] How many people saw this picture on the
[1:22:47] news? I didn't make it. People will say,
[1:22:51] "You make the I to make a pope." No,
[1:22:53] it's not me. Especially on this
[1:22:56] day, it's terrible to United States of
[1:22:59] America. I used to travel to to to to
[1:23:03] travel to United States of America. But
[1:23:04] this time, they ask me so many
[1:23:07] questions. What's going on here?
[1:23:10] My wife, she said, "Anie, can we go to
[1:23:12] to United States?" I say, "Okay." Oh,
[1:23:14] yeah. This is a come just now for
[1:23:16] sisters. Make it write it down, please.
[1:23:19] Sisters. She said to me, "Anie, I want
[1:23:22] to go to United States of America." I
[1:23:24] said, "Okay, so what do you mean?" She
[1:23:26] said, "Can you book the flight for me?"
[1:23:29] I said, "Okay, give me the date." She
[1:23:31] gave me a
[1:23:34] date. I was ready to book the ticket. So
[1:23:37] I say, "Oh." And she ch, she said, "No,
[1:23:39] can you come with me?" I say, "Oh, okay.
[1:23:42] I'll come with you. It's
[1:23:44] okay." And she
[1:23:46] say, "Women are
[1:23:52] different." Brother, when you want to
[1:23:54] marry, make sure you understand the
[1:23:58] woman. She said to me, "Make
[1:24:02] sure." She said to me, "Anig, she's the
[1:24:05] one who called me. She's the one who
[1:24:06] said to me she want to travel. I say
[1:24:09] okay. And she's the one who say book the
[1:24:11] ticket. I say okay. And she's the one
[1:24:13] who say can you come with me? I say
[1:24:15] okay. I say no. I say yes. I will go
[1:24:17] with you. It's okay. She said did you
[1:24:20] check the price? I say yes ma'am. Did
[1:24:23] you press did you check everything? I
[1:24:24] say yes. Okay.
[1:24:26] So I say do you want me just to book the
[1:24:29] flight or to book also the hotel? She
[1:24:31] said no no you need also to book the
[1:24:33] hotel. I said yes. Okay. I check the
[1:24:35] price of the ticket. I check the price
[1:24:37] of the hotel. So I she said for how many
[1:24:39] days? She say four days. I say thank
[1:24:40] you. So when I finish I say now for the
[1:24:46] payment. She said the Bible
[1:24:49] says every woman desire to be to his
[1:24:57] husband. I was stuck. I couldn't say
[1:24:59] anything else. I have just to say amen.
[1:25:06] She say you need to book the flight,
[1:25:10] book the hotel. And I and I say okay,
[1:25:13] okay, I will do for men. We need to
[1:25:15] protect the wife. So I say okay, I will
[1:25:17] book the flight and I'll book the hotel
[1:25:19] and I'll book the car. She say
[1:25:22] good payment. She said like I said to
[1:25:25] her, so for the payment, she
[1:25:28] said you always say that because it's
[1:25:30] the Bible.
[1:25:32] All the woman desire will be upon his
[1:25:36] husband. That was the answer for
[1:25:41] payment. And I
[1:25:43] say
[1:25:45] amen because it's a Bible. She read the
[1:25:47] scripture. You can't say anything
[1:25:50] brother. You can't
[1:25:53] say you can't say no. You see, brother,
[1:25:56] the Bible say no. No, no, it's not. The
[1:25:58] Bible say all the woman desire will be
[1:26:01] to
[1:26:02] his
[1:26:04] husband. So brother you have to say
[1:26:08] brother you have to say
[1:26:12] okay if she say you have to buy the
[1:26:15] private jet are you want to
[1:26:17] say
[1:26:20] yes. You know I give you the secret
[1:26:22] before I
[1:26:24] continue. Every time when your wife ask
[1:26:27] you something, is it difficult for you?
[1:26:30] You know what you want to do? Go to God.
[1:26:33] Say, "Lord, you the one who said that."
[1:26:36] And she asked me about what you already
[1:26:40] say. So I need
[1:26:43] it not for me, but she need it. And all
[1:26:46] high desire will be upon me. And I'm
[1:26:50] depending on you. So give her what she
[1:26:53] want.
[1:26:55] That is the secret of my life. If you
[1:26:59] read the Bible, I will say
[1:27:03] amen. And the Lord will
[1:27:06] provide. You saw this
[1:27:10] picture. This was President
[1:27:13] [Music]
[1:27:15] Trump one day
[1:27:17] before to elect a new pope in Roma.
[1:27:24] himself the president who published
[1:27:29] this he say is the high who make him a
[1:27:34] pope and he was so exciting to to see
[1:27:37] this picture and he published
[1:27:39] this and the white house everything's
[1:27:44] going to the white house become
[1:27:46] official that is what we need to know
[1:27:50] everything when is published by the
[1:27:52] White House it mean that is the office
[1:27:54] of the president he become
[1:27:58] official. They ask President Trump about
[1:28:00] the picture. They say but are you the
[1:28:04] pope? He say no but I
[1:28:07] wish to become a pope because the pope
[1:28:11] is more powerful person in the world. I
[1:28:14] wish to be a pope. And this was
[1:28:18] published on his
[1:28:20] account, social
[1:28:22] account. And the White House took
[1:28:25] advantage of this picture and they
[1:28:28] publish it in the White House to make it
[1:28:34] official. This is one day before they
[1:28:37] vote a pope in
[1:28:39] Roma. Brother, send me the second
[1:28:41] picture. after
[1:28:44] this after the election if in in Roma
[1:28:48] they elect a
[1:28:52] pope it's normal what is matter with
[1:28:55] this it's
[1:28:57] nothing they elect a new pope the one
[1:28:59] who pass away the new one come it's
[1:29:01] normal is a modern events in the world
[1:29:05] everybody was talking about that it's
[1:29:08] nothing this is what they
[1:29:11] Hey, who is Robert Privos the new pope
[1:29:14] Leon 14th? Even before his name was
[1:29:18] announced from the balcony of St.
[1:29:20] Peter's basilica, the crown below below
[1:29:24] where chaching viva
[1:29:26] ilapa long life the
[1:29:29] pope robert Francis previous 69 has
[1:29:33] become the
[1:29:35] 267th occupied of the throne of St. pill
[1:29:39] and he will be known as a Leon 14th. He
[1:29:42] is the first American to fill the role
[1:29:46] of pope. Author is considering as much
[1:29:49] as a cardinal from Latin America because
[1:29:52] of many years he spent as a missionary
[1:29:55] in Peru. Born in Chicago in 1955 to Per
[1:30:00] of Spanish and Franco Italian
[1:30:02] descent. I'm stopped there.
[1:30:06] What is mean to to the
[1:30:09] church? It's like a you and
[1:30:12] me. His parents was from Italies and
[1:30:15] Spanish. He born in Chicago in America.
[1:30:20] It's
[1:30:21] nothing. We going to talk about this
[1:30:23] man. We are in the church end time
[1:30:26] message church. We need to talk about
[1:30:27] the word of God. How many people believe
[1:30:30] the message is the word of God? I want
[1:30:33] to hear your amen. Amen.
[1:30:38] This was in the
[1:30:40] news. They talk about that and we saw
[1:30:43] the
[1:30:45] news as a believer.
[1:30:48] Now, is there anything about this in the
[1:30:52] message? Yes
[1:30:56] sir. That was the modern
[1:30:59] events. But we want to see if the
[1:31:02] prophecy will make it clear for us.
[1:31:08] Brother, give
[1:31:10] me act of the Holy
[1:31:13] Ghost. 50 54 12 19th
[1:31:24] evening. How many people will say amen?
[1:31:28] Okay, listen now to what the prophet say
[1:31:33] about the new pope of United States of
[1:31:36] America. Are you ready?
[1:31:39] I believe one of these glorious
[1:31:42] days when the United Confederation of
[1:31:46] Churches going
[1:31:47] together and the new pope is brought up
[1:31:52] out of United States and put over there.
[1:31:56] According to the
[1:32:00] prophecy. Did you hear
[1:32:03] me? According to the
[1:32:10] prophecy, just keep this for now,
[1:32:15] brother. Catholic
[1:32:17] church, the pope pass away. It's normal.
[1:32:21] He's a human being. He's not going to
[1:32:23] stay there forever. he die. They say,
[1:32:27] "Okay, as the pope die, we need to
[1:32:30] organize
[1:32:31] ourself. We need to elect a new
[1:32:34] pope." They went to the congress and
[1:32:37] they come together. They decide to vote
[1:32:41] a new pope. But one day before the
[1:32:46] election day, President Trump, he
[1:32:50] published his picture as a pope.
[1:32:56] They ask him a question. But president,
[1:32:59] you are not even a
[1:33:01] Catholic. You are not even Catholic. You
[1:33:03] never even go to Catholic church. You
[1:33:06] never even go. Only when the ceremony so
[1:33:09] you can get some vote.
[1:33:11] So that is normally happening. So even I
[1:33:15] I saw some people are Christian, they
[1:33:18] become lesbian, they become homosexual
[1:33:21] just to get a vote.
[1:33:24] That is the picture and he looks so can
[1:33:27] you imagine this is not a
[1:33:29] pop dressing like a pop and they say are
[1:33:35] you the one who want this to be like
[1:33:38] this he said no that was you made it but
[1:33:41] I like
[1:33:43] it they say are you sure but because you
[1:33:46] are the president when you are president
[1:33:48] of United States you can't make any
[1:33:50] mistake anything you say people will
[1:33:53] take it
[1:33:54] seriously and when is a published by the
[1:33:58] white house that mean he become
[1:34:04] official you say I wish to be a
[1:34:09] pope they say okay and it's
[1:34:13] pass they don't talk about that
[1:34:15] anymore is a part of
[1:34:19] story but for us believer of the message
[1:34:23] we went to check why why that's he
[1:34:27] dressing himself as a pope and why we
[1:34:30] have a a
[1:34:32] a pope in the story that is the
[1:34:38] first American pope in the
[1:34:42] story there was another one is a
[1:34:46] Latino is also
[1:34:49] American but the prophecy
[1:34:52] say when there will be a new
[1:34:55] pope from the United States of
[1:35:00] America. There's no two United States of
[1:35:02] America. No, only
[1:35:05] one. So what the prophets say about him?
[1:35:09] Brother, go
[1:35:11] back on my court.
[1:35:18] I believe one of these glorious
[1:35:21] days when this United Confederation of
[1:35:24] Church going together and the new pope
[1:35:29] is brought out of the United States and
[1:35:32] put over there according to the
[1:35:35] prophecy, then they will form a image
[1:35:40] like unto the beast.
[1:35:51] Now things become
[1:35:54] serious. People don't know why why why
[1:35:57] Trump is going around everybody. Why?
[1:36:01] Why is doing all these thing to people
[1:36:03] even to Canadian? Can you imagine last
[1:36:07] time in
[1:36:09] BC the border between Seattle and uh and
[1:36:12] Vancouver all that place people used to
[1:36:16] driving normally you want to go to
[1:36:18] United States you just show your
[1:36:19] passports and you pass that's all they
[1:36:22] say on the news they block the way you
[1:36:25] need to have a secondary you know when
[1:36:27] they put you on secondary that mean you
[1:36:30] are in trouble
[1:36:35] I have a Nexus card. How many people
[1:36:38] have a Nexus
[1:36:41] card? Nexus card mean you have a access
[1:36:44] in the airport. You are someone they
[1:36:47] trust
[1:36:49] 100%. I can forget my passport at home.
[1:36:52] I'll just take my Nexus card, go to the
[1:36:55] airport. They don't I don't need to to
[1:36:57] take off my shoes. I don't need to take
[1:36:59] my jacket off. I don't need to take off
[1:37:02] my laptop. Nothing. I will go through
[1:37:05] and there's a special line for Nexus
[1:37:08] people. People can be thousand on the
[1:37:11] line. They will wait there. But when you
[1:37:13] have a nexus card, there's a special
[1:37:15] place. So there are people special in
[1:37:18] the wall. They make the line for them.
[1:37:21] So when you come, you're not stopping.
[1:37:22] You just go straight. They don't take
[1:37:24] your shoes, jacket, laptop out. No, you
[1:37:27] go
[1:37:28] straight. But when I was making the
[1:37:31] application this time just to let them
[1:37:33] know that I'm coming to you to to
[1:37:35] America, they say, "Can you confirm that
[1:37:38] it's you?" Say, "But you have it on my
[1:37:41] on your data." They say, "Yes, but we
[1:37:44] need the selfie from
[1:37:45] you." Say, "This is the way it's coming
[1:37:48] now." They said, "No, no, you still have
[1:37:50] your privilege. Everything's nothing
[1:37:52] changed just to make sure it's you." I
[1:37:54] say, "Why?" because they say this is a
[1:37:57] new law in the United States of America.
[1:38:00] Can you imagine the way the United
[1:38:02] States is stretching
[1:38:05] Canada? Canada. They call it the mother
[1:38:08] of the the
[1:38:10] they the children of the same
[1:38:13] mother. Canada. Trump said no
[1:38:18] more things are
[1:38:20] changed. Why is changing everything? Not
[1:38:23] only Canada, even Mexico, he changed
[1:38:26] everything. China, Europe, the world is
[1:38:29] in trouble. They say why we vote for
[1:38:31] this man.
[1:38:34] Why? Everything is in the
[1:38:37] prophecy. Thus says the
[1:38:43] Lord and tell you the truth. Church of
[1:38:46] God will be dropped together. The
[1:38:49] real true believer out of Methodist,
[1:38:54] Baptist, Presbyisterian, Pentecostal,
[1:38:56] Nazaran, pilgrim, holiness, what'sever
[1:39:00] they will be will go
[1:39:03] together and cemented by the love of God
[1:39:08] that will make the body of the Lord
[1:39:10] Jesus Christ.
[1:39:12] all the
[1:39:16] believer and I not think and swallow him
[1:39:21] mining will be cast to one side. They go
[1:39:25] right on into the confederation of
[1:39:29] churches.
[1:39:32] 88
[1:39:34] and ants mean you're talking about
[1:39:38] something and you need to add something
[1:39:41] also
[1:39:43] important and I are real I read the
[1:39:47] other day even the assembly of God went
[1:39:50] into the confederation of churches oh my
[1:39:54] have to deny their evangelistical
[1:39:57] doctrine to do so that's Right? And all
[1:40:01] they Pentecostal sign and wonders
[1:40:04] principle they have to deny that to be
[1:40:08] in the confederation of churches have to
[1:40:11] deny it. Oh brother to have a
[1:40:21] privilege. The United States of America
[1:40:24] they say you don't need to bring a
[1:40:26] passport anymore in the airport. You
[1:40:28] don't need to bring the tickets, flight
[1:40:30] tickets.
[1:40:31] No. There is a
[1:40:33] system. They're calling
[1:40:36] face program. They have your face in the
[1:40:41] system. You don't need passport. You
[1:40:43] don't need You just go through to the
[1:40:45] airport. There's a special place. They
[1:40:49] they will just scan your first and you
[1:40:51] go to the airplane. That's all. You
[1:40:53] don't need passport. They have all your
[1:40:55] information.
[1:41:00] I read and I have said many times, lay
[1:41:04] on my stomach and drink branch water and
[1:41:08] eat soda crackers and be popular with
[1:41:11] God and to be his servant of God than to
[1:41:14] have the best there is this world
[1:41:18] givers. inherits to compromise of any fa
[1:41:22] my faith in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:26] and his Bible. I believe this is a
[1:41:30] fireable word of God and every word of
[1:41:33] his is right. Yes
[1:41:44] sir. Why I'm reading all these things?
[1:41:48] Why I'm telling you those things? I
[1:41:50] didn't make it by
[1:41:51] myself. I read and you are tested. You
[1:41:55] are my
[1:41:57] witness. Is thus sayith the
[1:42:00] Lord. Since
[1:42:03] 1933, brother was talking about those
[1:42:07] things. So what is the important of
[1:42:10] these things in our means?
[1:42:15] Time is coming tough. Nothing will be
[1:42:18] good anymore.
[1:42:20] Nothing. Don't think change things will
[1:42:23] be better. Nothing will be
[1:42:26] better. And the reason why I send the
[1:42:29] message to the White House, I send it to
[1:42:31] Kamala Harris by
[1:42:33] herself. I say that was before she
[1:42:37] become the president of United States of
[1:42:39] America. Before that I sent her a
[1:42:42] message to say you will be the first
[1:42:46] woman president of United States of
[1:42:49] America. They say how you know that
[1:42:54] because she's just became the vice
[1:42:57] president.
[1:42:59] When you become the first president of
[1:43:02] the United States of America,
[1:43:04] remember brother Brham gave seventh
[1:43:09] vision and the last one I said to them
[1:43:12] don't say brother Joshua did you say
[1:43:14] that? Yes. I told
[1:43:17] them Russia will burn United
[1:43:23] States is thus sayith the Lord it will
[1:43:26] happen. It doesn't matter why
[1:43:29] configuration how the the they the
[1:43:32] coming together to do all things is will
[1:43:34] it will never change anything. I want
[1:43:36] just to make it clear when brother Brown
[1:43:39] talking about the Russia is not talking
[1:43:42] about the president of the Russia.
[1:43:46] No, the one who will be the president of
[1:43:50] Russia on his time is the one who send
[1:43:54] all these atomic bomb in United
[1:43:59] States. So what is the important of
[1:44:01] these things for
[1:44:03] us? Brother say all the believer in the
[1:44:08] world not in the church.
[1:44:13] That one you can see some Catholic
[1:44:15] people they believe in the
[1:44:18] message they trust the
[1:44:21] message. You will see Pentecostal people
[1:44:24] they believe what can happen. God
[1:44:28] himself he will
[1:44:30] bring everyone together in one accord.
[1:44:36] They will believe everything the
[1:44:38] prophets
[1:44:40] say in
[1:44:43] love. That one you need to love your
[1:44:46] brother. You need to love your
[1:44:50] sister is a part of the
[1:44:54] prophecy. Make
[1:44:56] clear those events. You can see how
[1:44:59] people had become enemy hating one
[1:45:02] another for nothing.
[1:45:06] for
[1:45:09] nothing. I give you the
[1:45:12] testimony and even the sister she's here
[1:45:14] but she didn't know that I will say
[1:45:16] about that and she not even imagine I
[1:45:19] will say
[1:45:21] that we were to bad berry house we was
[1:45:26] talking and the sister was saying it's
[1:45:29] just part of the story she was just
[1:45:31] talking nothing
[1:45:33] special and she said for
[1:45:36] me sometime they call me for emergency
[1:45:39] See they say we need people at work. We
[1:45:43] need you to come please. So I say it's
[1:45:46] okay I can come even
[1:45:48] Saturday. So I'll go to work and when I
[1:45:52] come back home I'm tired. It's a body.
[1:45:54] I'm tired. So I need to sleep and woke
[1:45:57] up in the morning Sunday to go to the
[1:45:59] church is tough. But because I love my
[1:46:02] god I will make it. It become a
[1:46:06] sacrifice. That mean you are not free.
[1:46:08] You are tired. The body is tired. But
[1:46:10] you make it sacrifice to go to worship
[1:46:12] your
[1:46:13] God. And she didn't know when she was
[1:46:17] testifying. She was
[1:46:19] saying sometime I wake I'm just come to
[1:46:22] the church from
[1:46:24] work straight to the church. Just go
[1:46:27] home and fix kids arrange something and
[1:46:30] then come to church. My heart was
[1:46:33] burning. I said Lord forgive me.
[1:46:36] What I call sacrifice for me is not even
[1:46:40] sacrifice for other
[1:46:41] people. They're coming straight from
[1:46:44] work to the
[1:46:45] church. The body is
[1:46:49] tired. She didn't even
[1:46:51] sleep from work straight away to the
[1:46:54] church. Sister, do you believe now and
[1:46:56] again? You remember
[1:46:58] that? Amen. She didn't know about
[1:47:01] that. She remember just now in the
[1:47:04] church. She said that but for me become
[1:47:08] a
[1:47:10] testimony. For me become encouragement.
[1:47:13] So you you making something for the
[1:47:15] Lord, you can make it more for your
[1:47:18] God. You singing but you can make more
[1:47:21] for your God. You serving the Lord, you
[1:47:24] can make more for your God because this
[1:47:26] is the end time. Brother Abraham said
[1:47:29] all the things will happen in the end
[1:47:33] time where we living
[1:47:36] now brother make it your first thing to
[1:47:41] do in your
[1:47:43] life. You was coming to the church. Make
[1:47:45] it
[1:47:46] more. You was praying. This is not the
[1:47:49] time you can sleep. You need to pray
[1:47:55] now. It's normal to the world. People
[1:47:57] are driving. They didn't know exactly as
[1:48:00] it was in the time of
[1:48:03] Jesus. The Lord's your father, your God,
[1:48:07] your master who was with you, preaching
[1:48:10] you three days. You can't even see him.
[1:48:14] You not even recognize him. And he
[1:48:17] talking to you. Listen, sometimes Jesus
[1:48:20] will come and ask you, "Oh, you think is
[1:48:22] it
[1:48:24] true?" He said to them, "Oh, what are
[1:48:28] you talking about?" Did you think Jesus
[1:48:30] didn't know
[1:48:31] that? They're talking about him and he
[1:48:35] was there, but he's still asking them,
[1:48:39] "What are you talking about?" They say,
[1:48:41] "Oh, are you the holy one in Jerusalem?
[1:48:44] Did he know about what's happening three
[1:48:46] days ago?" You say, "What's
[1:48:50] happening?" Jesus asking means disciple
[1:48:54] what's happening. They say they're
[1:48:56] talking about Jesus, the one we we
[1:49:00] believe he was the Messiah. We believe
[1:49:04] he was the master. We believe he come to
[1:49:07] free Israel. We believe. But now he's
[1:49:15] dead and they kill
[1:49:18] him.
[1:49:21] Now we hear from
[1:49:24] woman. You
[1:49:26] know women are diff different with
[1:49:29] men. That is the secret of marriage. I'm
[1:49:33] I'm 17 years in the
[1:49:36] marriage. I was so young when I was
[1:49:38] married. People was asking me why you
[1:49:40] are so young what are you why because
[1:49:42] you have a money or you want to marry
[1:49:43] why stay wait don't rush you have a more
[1:49:48] time cuz I was on the 20th 20 I didn't
[1:49:51] reach 30 when I was
[1:49:55] married for whom when they get news in
[1:49:59] few minutes you will hear that even in
[1:50:01] United States you will hear it
[1:50:05] immediately it was already spread
[1:50:07] everywhere They say the woman they went
[1:50:10] to the sea and they they didn't saw
[1:50:13] Jesus but someone tell
[1:50:16] them and Peter and John they say are you
[1:50:21] serious we are the leader of the church
[1:50:24] how is appear to you just a you're just
[1:50:27] a woman so why I appear to you they say
[1:50:31] he even call me by my name
[1:50:34] Mary so we need to go to check to make
[1:50:38] sure if is it
[1:50:40] true. When they arrive, they think was
[1:50:43] real, but they didn't see
[1:50:50] Jesus. They didn't see Jesus. He just
[1:50:54] called Mary by the name. But when Peter
[1:50:58] was there with John, he didn't show up
[1:51:00] to say, "Peter, okay, now you are here."
[1:51:02] Because I was talking just to those
[1:51:04] ladies. Now you are here, Peter and
[1:51:06] John. So I will talk to you
[1:51:09] nothing. God can re reveal himself to
[1:51:14] who he
[1:51:15] wants. He enter message God reveal
[1:51:19] himself to William Mariam
[1:51:22] Brham. He can give this prophecy to
[1:51:25] someone else but he said no I will give
[1:51:28] it to the small group. They will know
[1:51:32] the modern event are made clear by the
[1:51:37] prophecy. People don't know what's
[1:51:39] happening. They say is a news is a part
[1:51:43] of reality. Things are going on
[1:51:46] everything. But for you, you know is a
[1:51:49] prophecy.
[1:51:54] So what can happen now? Things are
[1:51:57] changed.
[1:51:59] You need to pray more. You need to read
[1:52:02] the Bible more.
[1:52:04] Even is
[1:52:07] not this
[1:52:10] Bible. You can read it in on your phone.
[1:52:13] Read
[1:52:16] it. Read
[1:52:18] it.
[1:52:20] Pray. This is not the time to joke. That
[1:52:23] one the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a
[1:52:25] very
[1:52:27] important. By the
[1:52:29] way, brother
[1:52:33] say the baptism of Holy
[1:52:36] Ghost
[1:52:37] normally we get it when you went to the
[1:52:42] water. When you get it from the water,
[1:52:45] you come out. That is the moment you be
[1:52:49] filled with the Holy Ghost. That is the
[1:52:52] first
[1:52:53] condition. If you miss, your confession
[1:52:56] was not
[1:52:58] right, then he will baptize you when a
[1:53:02] ministers preaching or when they lay
[1:53:04] their head on you to receive the Holy
[1:53:07] Ghost.
[1:53:09] That is another
[1:53:11] condition. But the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:14] Ghost is just the beginning of the
[1:53:17] Christian life.
[1:53:20] It's just the beginning. That mean you
[1:53:23] are born in the body of
[1:53:26] Christ. So now you need to start
[1:53:31] walking. It doesn't mean that when you
[1:53:33] have a Holy Ghost, you're not going to
[1:53:35] sin. It will happen because you're still
[1:53:37] a
[1:53:37] baby. For baby from here to walk there
[1:53:42] is a is a is a
[1:53:45] sacrifice. It will fail many times to
[1:53:47] reach there. But for you it become a
[1:53:50] normal. Why? Because you grow in the
[1:53:55] spirits in your life. When you reading
[1:53:57] the Bible, you will hear the Lord
[1:54:00] speaking to
[1:54:01] you. I'll give you a few testimony
[1:54:04] before I
[1:54:08] close. That is not the
[1:54:11] Bible. Is not the
[1:54:15] message. Now I'm talking about me.
[1:54:19] Why I believe brother
[1:54:21] Brham with no
[1:54:24] [Music]
[1:54:26] hesitation even if brother Brham say
[1:54:30] that we found it the message can one day
[1:54:33] we will start walking by the hand not by
[1:54:36] the foot I will say
[1:54:39] amen I don't know how can happen but if
[1:54:42] he say that I will say amen
[1:54:47] can Can you imagine how people become a
[1:54:49] naked in this world? You can't even
[1:54:52] sometime in my
[1:54:54] life there's a three place I always go
[1:54:58] three. If I'm not at work, I will be in
[1:55:01] my
[1:55:02] house. If I'm not in my house, I'll be
[1:55:05] at church. That's
[1:55:07] all. At least I go with my family. We go
[1:55:10] somewhere. The sin sin is everywhere.
[1:55:14] You can't even you close your eyes you
[1:55:16] can hear the
[1:55:19] sin is
[1:55:22] everywhere. I was saying I want to
[1:55:24] close one day last uh holy communion we
[1:55:30] had in the church I was
[1:55:33] praying.
[1:55:36] So I come to sit on the face where my
[1:55:39] daughter she is now. She's my my my
[1:55:41] pretty daughter. She was playing piano
[1:55:44] in in Lech Bridge. She said, "Brother
[1:55:46] Joshua, I can't play." I said, "No, no,
[1:55:47] no. I'll pray for you. You play nicely
[1:55:50] like your father." She said, "I don't
[1:55:52] think so." I said, "Can I pray for you?"
[1:55:54] She said, "Yes." Okay, I pray for her.
[1:55:56] She was the keyboard player in
[1:55:57] Leedbridge. Now, are you playing still
[1:55:59] now? Okay, thank God. That's good. So I
[1:56:03] was sitting
[1:56:04] there first of all I was sitting down
[1:56:06] there and I say okay let me move so I
[1:56:10] can help brother to organize things in
[1:56:12] the service. When I finish, I sit on
[1:56:14] this place and I hear
[1:56:17] something telling me, "Go back to your
[1:56:20] seat." And I went to sit
[1:56:23] back and I was
[1:56:27] waiting and I see the brother was next
[1:56:30] to
[1:56:32] me. I was hope we will do the service
[1:56:35] with him.
[1:56:38] After a few minutes there was there was
[1:56:40] another brother in this line who called
[1:56:42] the brother say brother can you do foot
[1:56:45] wash with me and the brother say yes I
[1:56:47] say oh no I'm I'm leaving I'm I'm alone
[1:56:52] now and the lord told me someone will
[1:56:56] come to you and you pray for him only
[1:56:59] for two things not three because
[1:57:01] sometime we mixing prayer but if you ask
[1:57:04] lord lord what can I pray for my brother
[1:57:08] or for my
[1:57:09] sister. What can I
[1:57:11] say? The Lord told me, "You pray only
[1:57:14] for two
[1:57:16] things." And I say, "Okay, but I don't
[1:57:18] know the
[1:57:19] person." And later when I saw brother
[1:57:22] Peter, he come to me say, "Brother, are
[1:57:26] you do you have someone to do the foot
[1:57:27] wash?" I said, "No, brother." He say,
[1:57:29] "Okay, you do it for me, so we'll do
[1:57:31] together." I say, "Okay, thank you." So,
[1:57:34] we come to do the food. That was a
[1:57:36] normal service.
[1:57:40] When I start praying the things the Lord
[1:57:43] told me to pray for my brother. But
[1:57:46] before even that I say the Lord told me
[1:57:48] pray for brother Peter for the house and
[1:57:51] for the car. I said I know brother
[1:57:55] Peter. I know him. I know brother Peter.
[1:57:58] I have a car and he have a house. The
[1:58:01] Lord say that what I'm asking you to
[1:58:03] pray for. Sometime the Lord can wake up
[1:58:06] you at the night. That's what I want to
[1:58:08] tell you the truth. Sometime the Lord
[1:58:11] can make you wake up at night and he's
[1:58:14] pushing you to pray and the first things
[1:58:17] coming to your mind if he's your brother
[1:58:20] pray for him. If is your sister pray for
[1:58:24] him. The Lord knows
[1:58:28] why. And when we start praying with
[1:58:31] brother Peter, when I finished to pray,
[1:58:34] brother Peter said, "Brother, you didn't
[1:58:37] even know what was going on in my
[1:58:40] life. The thing you pray, this is
[1:58:43] exactly what I was looking
[1:58:45] for. I have this this this this
[1:58:48] situation. I was asking the Lord as you
[1:58:51] pray, I believe everything will happen."
[1:58:55] But it's true. It's true.
[1:59:01] The other thing is happening today.
[1:59:07] I was in the
[1:59:09] office. I was asking even before brother
[1:59:12] Barry asked me to preach. I was say Lord
[1:59:15] what can I preach? He said preach about
[1:59:17] this this this.
[1:59:21] In my
[1:59:23] office, I see brother
[1:59:26] John who come to me. I said, "Brother,
[1:59:29] can you ask the song leader to sing this
[1:59:32] song before I come to
[1:59:34] preach?" He said, "Brother, he just
[1:59:39] come." He said, "Brother, you don't know
[1:59:41] what you're talking about. That is a
[1:59:43] exactly what I was preparing myself to
[1:59:46] do." So, this is a confirmation from
[1:59:49] God.
[1:59:54] When the prophet says something is
[1:59:57] always be
[1:59:58] true events more than events make clear
[2:00:03] by
[2:00:04] prophecy. So that mean you need to have
[2:00:07] more love for
[2:00:09] now brother. If you have to go get
[2:00:12] married go to get
[2:00:14] married. You need a job go get it. Soon
[2:00:18] we will leave all these things. We are
[2:00:21] marching to Zion. It's not a story
[2:00:24] anymore. Is but does say the Lord.
[2:00:29] We're going home. You have a business,
[2:00:32] make a plan, do it because we're going
[2:00:35] soon. You want to buy a house, buy it.
[2:00:38] We're going soon. Don't lose your
[2:00:42] time. I read what the Bible says and
[2:00:46] what the message say.
[2:00:51] events made clear by the
[2:00:56] prophecy. Sometime the Lord is speaking
[2:00:58] to
[2:01:00] us. Stand up and say amen. You hesitate.
[2:01:04] You miss your
[2:01:06] blessing. The Lord says clap your hands.
[2:01:09] You you
[2:01:10] hesitating. How many time when you was
[2:01:12] in the world you are screaming when you
[2:01:14] watching soccer or something like this?
[2:01:17] How many time how many time when he was
[2:01:20] in the party you was dancing you was
[2:01:22] enjoying you was free to do everything.
[2:01:25] What about your
[2:01:27] God? You're feeling shame in the house
[2:01:30] of your father.
[2:01:33] You are not feeling free not even to say
[2:01:35] amen to the
[2:01:37] words. This is the time if you have to
[2:01:39] say amen to say it more.
[2:01:43] If you have to pray pray more. We going
[2:01:47] home, my brother and my
[2:01:50] sisters. The Lord is
[2:01:53] coming and we need to
[2:01:56] prepare. Make sure you have a Holy
[2:01:59] Ghost. Make
[2:02:02] sure you have it because if you pass
[2:02:07] away, that will be the end.
[2:02:11] I saw rich people,
[2:02:14] billionaire, when they pass away, he
[2:02:17] didn't even take
[2:02:18] $1. They don't want even to put it in
[2:02:22] his pocket. They don't want to give him
[2:02:23] his money. But he's the one who
[2:02:26] suffer, no sleep, working so hard to get
[2:02:30] this money. And now when he pass away,
[2:02:32] they keep all the money. They don't want
[2:02:34] even to give
[2:02:36] him. Not even $1.
[2:02:39] This world is I don't know how can I say
[2:02:43] that not even to to not even
[2:02:47] coins just to say you make more so
[2:02:49] sacrifice to make this money you keep
[2:02:52] this one on your coffee there you can
[2:02:54] go nothing they say we keep
[2:02:58] everything and if you make mistake when
[2:03:01] you signing all your paper in the bank
[2:03:04] they will catch all your
[2:03:06] money they will keep
[2:03:08] it. You will go to the
[2:03:11] foundations and organizations, they will
[2:03:14] say because you didn't sign this paper.
[2:03:17] Make sure when you signing a paper in
[2:03:20] the in the banks or financial
[2:03:22] institution, make sure you know the
[2:03:24] person after you who can get that
[2:03:29] money. Why the world become so crazy?
[2:03:35] This is the
[2:03:37] end. Love your brother and your sister.
[2:03:40] Brother say all the believer will come
[2:03:46] together. That's when you see people
[2:03:48] division everywhere.
[2:03:50] People things are going mess in the
[2:03:54] world because the prophecy say only the
[2:03:58] few people will take serious the will of
[2:04:02] God.
[2:04:05] Only few people will take it
[2:04:08] serious
[2:04:10] because
[2:04:11] this modern
[2:04:14] events are made clear by the
[2:04:19] prophecy. Brother and sister, what do
[2:04:22] you want the Lord to do for you? What do
[2:04:25] you need
[2:04:26] more? What do you need from God for your
[2:04:30] Christian
[2:04:32] life? What do you need? Pray
[2:04:35] more, read more the
[2:04:38] word, be close to
[2:04:41] God. That is what we need on this
[2:04:45] time. Can you stand up? So we will
[2:04:49] pray. I want you to
[2:04:53] pray. I'll call the musician. I want you
[2:04:57] to pray for your your your desire, your
[2:04:59] heart desire. That one I didn't ask the
[2:05:03] church to pray. No, I want to make it to
[2:05:07] the end. That must be your desire, your
[2:05:10] prayer. Now that will come from your
[2:05:14] heart. What you need from
[2:05:20] God. Let's close our eyes.
[2:05:30] God knows what you
[2:05:33] need but he want also you to
[2:05:37] speak to him when brother playing this
[2:05:40] the
[2:05:42] music. I'll ask you to pray for what you
[2:05:45] need your heart
[2:05:48] desires. If your life is not close to
[2:05:52] Jesus, the way you was praying
[2:05:57] before hours in the presence of the
[2:06:00] Lord, you was reading the
[2:06:03] Bible, but now is no
[2:06:06] more. You was praying by
[2:06:10] yourself, spending time with the
[2:06:13] Lord. Why did you
[2:06:16] stop the pressure of the world?
[2:06:21] things with the world that is stopping
[2:06:23] you to
[2:06:27] [Music]
[2:06:29] pray. Where are you now with your
[2:06:33] God? How are you feeling shamed to
[2:06:35] worship God? Why are you feeling shamed
[2:06:38] to say amen to the
[2:06:40] words? Why you feeling shamed to read
[2:06:43] the
[2:06:44] Bible, to read the message?
[2:06:49] [Music]
[2:06:52] Now you have a free
[2:06:53] [Music]
[2:06:56] minutes to say to God what is your heart
[2:07:00] [Music]
[2:07:03] desire. Let's pray together
[2:07:06] now. Say to Lord what you
[2:07:11] need. Pray to God when the musician they
[2:07:14] are playing.
[2:07:16] telling me what you
[2:07:19] need. God, I need you more than
[2:07:26] myself. Father, as I'm standing here, I
[2:07:29] pray Lord, help
[2:07:31] me. Help me, Lord, to be close to you
[2:07:35] like
[2:07:36] before where I was able to pray more.
[2:07:41] Lord, the thing of the world is stopping
[2:07:44] me to pray more, to spend more time with
[2:07:47] you.
[2:07:48] Lord, I ask you to forgive me.
[2:07:51] Father, be merciful to
[2:07:53] me. But when we can see the
[2:07:58] prophecy, it make clear those events. We
[2:08:02] was here in the world, we didn't know
[2:08:05] that it was already a prophecy. But now
[2:08:07] we know Lords is coming soon. Soon we
[2:08:11] going
[2:08:12] home. Soon we leaving this world. Father
[2:08:16] I pray be merciful to me. Be merciful to
[2:08:20] me Lord. Help me to be close to you.
[2:08:24] Help me to read more Bible. Help me to
[2:08:27] pray. Help me to live a Christian life
[2:08:30] every way in the church, at work, every
[2:08:34] way.
[2:08:37] Father, thank you for the
[2:08:39] message. Thank you for the
[2:08:42] message. Thank you for sending a
[2:08:46] prophet and those
[2:08:48] events become clear by the
[2:08:53] prophecy. We thank you
[2:08:57] Lord in Jesus name.
[2:09:01] How many people would like that I can
[2:09:04] pray for them? Brother Joshua, I need a
[2:09:07] prayer. Let me see your hand
[2:09:10] now. Father, I put also my hand
[2:09:13] up because I need you too for my life,
[2:09:18] Lord. The pressure of the world, things
[2:09:21] of the world, pressure of everything we
[2:09:25] see in the news. Father we
[2:09:28] pray help us Lord to be close to you to
[2:09:34] read more Bibles to read more the
[2:09:37] message to pray more than anything else
[2:09:41] and to put you first in everything. If
[2:09:44] someone didn't have a Holy Ghost Lord I
[2:09:47] pray could baptize him with the Holy
[2:09:50] Ghost in the mighty name of Lord Jesus
[2:09:52] Christ. Amen.
[2:09:55] If someone who forgets to come close to
[2:09:59] you, I pray Lord bring him back in Jesus
[2:10:03] name.
[2:10:06] Those who are sick, oh Lord, you are the
[2:10:09] healer. Heal them in Jesus name. Those
[2:10:14] who have want to travel, Lord, be
[2:10:16] merciful to them. those who want to be
[2:10:19] closer to you
[2:10:21] again, help them in Jesus name.
[2:10:26] Father, we thank
[2:10:27] you and we surrender this week in your
[2:10:30] hands.
[2:10:33] We know that the devil is not
[2:10:36] happy. He will continue to fight
[2:10:39] us because the prophet say this world is
[2:10:43] the Eden of
[2:10:46] Satan. There's a Satan who control the
[2:10:48] world is Satan who control everything in
[2:10:51] this world. And we pray Lord be with us.
[2:10:57] Protect us. Keep us
[2:11:00] by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[2:11:05] Bless this
[2:11:06] week. As tomorrow we celebrating
[2:11:09] Victoria Day, we pray Lord be with us.
[2:11:13] People will drive terrible. People will
[2:11:16] drink, people will do whatever. And
[2:11:19] there was there will be mess up
[2:11:21] everywhere as they always be in the TV,
[2:11:24] in the radio, in the news, everywhere.
[2:11:28] Lord, protect even your servant. Where
[2:11:31] is it? In Edmonton, protect him when we
[2:11:34] come back with the family. And I pray
[2:11:36] for our brothers in Leed preach. Be with
[2:11:39] them also, Lord. And we pray for all the
[2:11:42] sense in the
[2:11:45] world. Keep us safe.
[2:11:48] You know our heart desire.
[2:11:51] Lord grant it in Jesus name.
[2:11:56] Amen. God bless you.
[2:12:00] And I
[2:12:01] think God willing I will see you again
[2:12:05] soon. So I would like brother Paul to
[2:12:07] come to take the service back when we
[2:12:11] singing like a few song before we
[2:12:12] [Music]
[2:12:15] finish. Say God bless you to your
[2:12:17] brother. Say God bless you to your
[2:12:21] sister. Soon I will see you again.

[2:13:39] [Music]
[2:13:43] God. Holy
[2:13:46] word, long
[2:13:49] preserved for our
[2:13:52] walk in this world.
[2:13:56] They
[2:13:57] resound with God's own
[2:14:00] heart. Oh, let the ancient words
[2:14:06] impart. Word of
[2:14:09] God, ever
[2:14:12] true. It's changing
[2:14:15] me and it's changing
[2:14:18] you. We have
[2:14:21] come with open hearts.
[2:14:25] Oh, let the word of God.
[2:14:30] Maybe bow with me as we close in prayer
[2:14:32] just before we sing the next verse.
[2:14:34] Father, we just thank you this morning,
[2:14:36] Lord. We know that certainly that the
[2:14:40] prophecies have made your word come to
[2:14:42] pass, Lord, and we've we've seen it
[2:14:44] clearly, Lord, for all these years. But
[2:14:46] Lord, as our brother has reminded us of
[2:14:47] the lateness of the hour, it's just
[2:14:49] certainly been amazing to see how you've
[2:14:52] brought even things Lord prophesied in
[2:14:55] 1933. We've all been watching those
[2:14:58] things, realizing they're they're just
[2:15:00] around the corner. And here they are,
[2:15:01] Lord, happening right around us. We
[2:15:03] thank you, Lord, that our eyes have been
[2:15:06] opened, Lord. As we started this this
[2:15:08] this service with a song, Lord, we're
[2:15:11] we're we're blessed, oh God. We are so
[2:15:13] blessed to have the eyes of our hearts
[2:15:15] enlightened according to Ephesians,
[2:15:17] speaking that, Lord. Father, would you
[2:15:19] take the word, Lord, anchored in the
[2:15:21] hearts of each one. Lord, we we've been
[2:15:23] called upon to to step a little higher,
[2:15:26] Lord. You you you said that through your
[2:15:27] servant this morning, Lord. May each of
[2:15:29] us just examine ourselves, Lord. I know
[2:15:32] myself, oh God, your br your prophet
[2:15:34] talked about the bride's revival. Lord,
[2:15:37] we desire the trash to be pushed out of
[2:15:39] our lives and for you to take more
[2:15:41] precedence, Lord, in every area of our
[2:15:43] life. May we take the word of God with
[2:15:45] us, that beautiful word of God, that
[2:15:47] it's the only thing that'll change us,
[2:15:50] Father. May we take it with us as a
[2:15:52] shield from every snare as well. Oh God,
[2:15:54] each one that's here this morning, may
[2:15:56] you bless them, Lord. If there's someone
[2:15:58] that's got questions, Father, may you
[2:16:00] answer. Lord, you said to cast our care
[2:16:02] upon you because you care for us. Lord,
[2:16:05] I think that's just such a paradox. Why
[2:16:07] would you, the God of the universe, want
[2:16:09] the cares of all of us? And Lord, it's
[2:16:12] it's it's the way you are. It's your
[2:16:13] attribute. You love us that much, oh
[2:16:15] God, that you want us just to cast our
[2:16:17] care upon upon you, Lord. May we do that
[2:16:20] through this week, Lord. May we look to
[2:16:22] you, the author and finisher of our
[2:16:24] faith. Lord, you're so wonderful and we
[2:16:26] want to give you the glory, the honor,
[2:16:28] Lord, even through our lives. May our
[2:16:30] lives represent your word living itself
[2:16:33] through us, Lord. And we so we're so
[2:16:35] thankful that we have the word of God in
[2:16:37] us. We have the faith of God in us.
[2:16:39] Lord, it's living through us. May you
[2:16:40] grant grace to each one here that's
[2:16:42] gathered this morning. Bless them as
[2:16:44] they go their ways. Lord, as our
[2:16:46] brothers even prayed for journeying
[2:16:47] mercies for our pastor and his family,
[2:16:49] Lord, all of us as we go, we know how
[2:16:51] quickly just a just a a flick of a
[2:16:54] steering wheel can make such a
[2:16:56] difference. We can be in a real bad
[2:16:57] spot, Lord. Father, protect each of us,
[2:17:00] Lord, as we travel home. We'll give you
[2:17:02] the glory for it, Lord. We love you. We
[2:17:04] appreciate you. We love each other,
[2:17:05] Lord. And we thank you for your precious
[2:17:07] word this morning. Grant these mercies
[2:17:09] we pray in Jesus precious name. Amen.
[2:17:13] Amen. Second verse. Words of
[2:17:16] life, words of
[2:17:19] hope, give us
[2:17:22] strength. Help us
[2:17:25] go in this
[2:17:28] world where we
[2:17:31] roam. The word of God will guide us
[2:17:36] home. Isn't that great news? For word of
[2:17:40] God, it's ever true.
[2:17:44] is changing
[2:17:46] me and it's changing
[2:17:49] you. We have
[2:17:52] come with open
[2:17:55] hearts. Oh, let the word of God impart.
[2:18:00] Oh word of
[2:18:03] God ever true. God bless you. It's
[2:18:07] changing me.
