Isaiah uh the book of Isaiah excuse me Isaiah Chapter 19 Verse 1-3 Isaiah chapter 19 1-3 and then from there we'll move on to uh 2 Corinthians uh chapter 10 or maybe before we do that yeah we can do that then we'll read another scripture um Isaiah chapter 19 1 to3 the burden of Egypt behold the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud and shall come into Egypt and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it and out set the Egyptians against Egyptians and they shall fight everyone against his brother and everyone against his neighbor City against City and Kingdom against Kingdom the spirit of Egypt shall F fail in the midst thereof and I'll destroy the counil thereof and they shall seek to the idols and to the Charmers and to them that are familiar spirits and to the Wizards 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verse three for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our welfare or Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled let's go to uh uh Exodus chapter 14 Exodus chapter 14 amen we zero in verse 12 uh Exodus 14 ver2 and then we jump uh uh after we jump over to 24th uh uh 24th uh verse um uh and listen to the uh children of Israel murmuring and complaining now is not this the word the word that we did tell the the in Egypt saying let us alone that we may save the Egyptians for it had been better for us to save the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness Moses responded here and Moses said unto the people fear not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will to you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you and you shall be at PE you shall hold your peace 24 and it came to pass that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of Egyptians through the pillar of fire how many believe that the pillar of fire is still here and of the cloud and troubled the host of the Egyptians other versions say confused the host of the Egyptians and took off their chariot wheels that they drove them heavily so that the Egyptians said let us flee from the uh place of Israel from the face of Israel for the Lord fighteth for them and against the Egyptians amen may the Lord add blessing to the reading of his word we may take our seats uh May our hearts be blessed this morning may we say like those two to EMAs that did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us on the word I believe uh our God is not just the god of the elderly I I I believe he not just the O the god of the mothers the fathers he's also the god of the children I believe he's a personal God this morning that whatever you are going through whether you're a child whether you're middle age whether you're elderly Our God can address you in a personal way and at a personal level you love the Lord this morning I can see that this church is already on fire it reminds me of back home already and and I love a church that's on fire for the Living God brother Brenham says God hats a powerless religion and we are not a powerless people we are not a a fearful people the Bible says fear not and today I want to bring my uh if it's okay brother Barry I know you that way too but but this puppet was made for preachers to walk on so if I go back and forth my brother just follow with me your eyes with me and and let's go together on this little trip and we are all buckled up right now and ready for takeoff but but my my title this morning is total confusion in the camp of your enemies I pray that by the end of this service there would be total confusion in the camp of your enemies this morning and I don't care what enemy you have but that enemy is under your feet as a Christian you believe that this morning that our God is more than able to deliver you he's more than able to give you your heart's desire this morning he's more than able to drive out all those demons that are bothering you and your children total confusion in the camp of your enemy the Bible says I'll make Egyptians fight against Egyptians I'll make your enemies fight against each other may I say this my brother if the enemy is trying to get at you to today if he's trying to get at your family today we are living in a time that our marriages are being compromised we are living in a time that the devil is coming in between husband and wife we're living in a time that the divorce cases are so on the much on the increase we're living in a time where mental uh issues are on the rise my brothers my sisters young and old alike the spirit of uh uh uh uh uh suicide and depression is on the increase we have heard about cancer we've heard about blood pressure diabetes all those things but the most one on the increase right now is mental illness and I pray that we have not been given that kind of a spirit the Bible says we've been given the spirit of boldness and of love and of a sound mind my brother may there be a sound mind in each and every one of you today that when you walk out of here it doesn't matter what the world thinks about you this morning I'm looking at a people that have totally resigned to the enemy you're not looking at the mechanizations of the enemy you are looking up to God because in these times that we're living in the Bible says look up for your Redemption dwth night you love the Lord this morning may I encourage you this morning you are not over born woman this morning you are a free people you're of a free woman and where the spirit of God is there is Liberty my brother where the spirit of God is the demons are driven away the spirits are cast down that's the business we are in is to bring down strongholds and Cast Away every spirit that doesn't recognize Jesus Christ in our lives Hallelujah this morning God help us this morning may our young people be filled with the Holy Ghost that's the ticket you need to go to heaven my brother my sister and it doesn't matter what age you are at my brother you can be filled you children here with the Holy Ghost why is it that our churches are so full of dead dead children spiritually speaking God help us God bring the spirit of Elijah that we may believe this message and have the Holy Ghost on our young people amen then you can conquer that devil at your school you can conquer that devil at work what you what we need young and old alike oh somebody says I got the Holy Spirit 20 years ago but what about now what about now

kingdom of God comes without observation amen where did Jesus go to school what about Peter he couldn't even write his name the Bible says it's by the Holy Ghost my brother that's when you get filled with the Holy Ghost a man who couldn't preach or do anything or write his name on the day of Pentecost yes sir he was the one to speak to those people we are not drunk as you suppose but this is what the prophet Joel prophesied am and that Spirit has never left the prophet says each one of you when we come to we come to church each one of us bring a liak of fire amen a liak of Fire a leak of fire

your in your in your life my brother my sister Hallelujah when you are running that 4 by really I was a cross country Champion for many years in my province in during my high school years so I know a little bit about running when they give that baton when they line them for Runners the first one is usually the second fastest then the second and third they're not the fastest and the last one is the fastest so when they give him that second fastest has to do the best he can or she can to give to these other two that are not the fastest and the job of the the fourth Runner they call him the anchor the job of that one is two fold one is to maintain the lead if they're still leading the second is to run as fast to outrun the ones if the other two maybe they they were overrun you can they can run and still be number one amen that's four but God is not fulfilled in four he's fulfilled in seven amen we had Paul right at the start then we had all these Dark Ages come through but we had the seventh messenger my brother who Rose above everything else my brother by God's grace it right into he wasn't just a prophet he was a prophet messenger amen but not just a prophet messenger he was a sear somebody that could talk to God right lip to ear and listen to this in the Garden of Eden in the beginning what language was God speaking with Adam because language started at the Tower of Babel that's right that's right that's right it was a thought language that's why God would ask Adam and say what do you think that tree what what did you name it oh it's a bobab tree and God said that's exactly right because why God knew what it was and Adam had to tap into God's mind amen and my brother when you can see some of the things what happened to Abraham and Sarah right the Bible doesn't said until Revelation strikes that they were changed Amen to a young man and a young woman amen what happened in the garden of Edom they didn't eat a pear amen wasn't some apple until Revelation struck of what actually happened serpent seed amen We Believe those things because they line up with scripture and look at that when you look at that into God's mind today we have the fullness of the word like the brother was saying we are not looking Darkly now we're not we're not in darkness we're not we're not guessing or second guessing we have the full revelation of the word of God Amen

500 sheep and another one the neighbor with only one sheep one with 500 kills the one and to get that that other neighbor's sheep and David was angry that can't happen in My Kingdom that man must die amen and Nathan looked him right in the stet with those squinted eyes of a prophet amen and say David you're not going to die then David realized it was him had 500 wives the other one had only one and David was so ashamed you know when you're ashamed your head is down right it's down with shame David the inspiration to sing he was the chief musician left him he didn't have appetite to go to church may I encourage everybody go to church brother Brenham says Church helps but it doesn't save you but it helps we need each other my brother we need each other like this we need to to to to keep hot at it in this message of the hour and David stayed at home didn't do anything much months later or time later his friends you know when something wrong happens with you that's when you see who your true friends are right look at job but when job rose up he said I know my redeemer liveth amen David was in a corner by himself and his friends begin to ask themselves has anybody been in t touch with David of L this one said no that one says no guys something is wrong with us remember when I was down there it was David who lifted me up and another one said the same another one he said let's go now let's go to David's house let's find out let's be interested in his welfare yes he fell yes he committed such a a thing terrible thing but let's go and talk to him amen that's the way of a true Christian my brother yes and they went to David's house to the Palace they found David there and they said David we're sorry you can search it brother bam dramatizes it that but we can't just leave you like this let's go for Fellowship David amen you children this message it's not about dos and don'ts it's about you can dance to the Lord when I was D dancing in those PBS before but now I can dance for the Lord in the house of the [Applause] Lord I used to sing them regular songs and all this filthy of the world but now I can sing songs of Zion let me tell you the truth they went to David then they said David today we are going to the house of the Lord whether you like it or not if we have to manhandle you we're going to manand but we are going to the house of the Lord Brother sister that's the way of a true Christian hold each other up let's go for Fellowship amen amen that's right and if it's prayer night let's go for prayer night because we put down strongholds when we pray brother Brenham says the prayer of a son or daughter of God is a million times more powerful than a prayer of an Angel because why you've been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ thank you Lord and they went to David and David said I'm not going I know what I did said David burdens are lifted at Calvary Hallelujah let's go to the house of the Lord they went there David they said BR said David didn't even go up here sat in a corner with with his head down then the music started playing tenderly and without realizing it David started tapping his his foot down to the music before he realized it was both both feet he was tapping them before he realized he was doing like this and before he knew it he was worshiping the Lord when church was over he went home then inspiration came back again and David pained the song I was glad very glad when they say to me let us go to the house of the Lord they'll be singing they'll be shouting there'll be Victory may I say Let There Be victory in this room this day May there be shouting in the camp because why our God is more than Victorious then in Psalms chapter 3 David says the Lord God is the lifter of my head from one that was looking down now

in both parts of the world reasoning and doubt yes stubbornness the Bible says is as a spirit of Witchcraft amen amen when you hear the word don't Harden your heart either way you won't go out of here the same way you can either you go better off or worse off that's right amen may I say this as a servant of the Living God and like the prophet would say I take every Spirit under my control I don't care whether a spirit have met with Wizards and Witchcraft in Africa there but by the power of the Living God well they would be coming and I would be coming going this way different directions I came to find out by some of them who brought their charms they couldn't face me because it was all they were seeing was light they had to Branch off to go into the into Into the Wilderness and let the Son

had clopped feet or whatever and they're walking and they walked by faith hallelujah amen even if they had leprosy they were still children of Israel amen amen they started walking the Bible says amen each step they took caused rumbling on the ground am by the time that sounds of the rumbling reached the syrians it was a loud loud rumbling that they had ever heard am a step of a leper wow caused that much confusion amen with the syrians and the Syrian says oh I think they've hired the Egyptians and this and this group to come and attack us let's flee and the syrians flee that area and they left all the merchandise the food and everything their horses they left them when the lepers got there there was plenty to eat it had been prophesied by the Prophet Elijah brother we are the micas of
