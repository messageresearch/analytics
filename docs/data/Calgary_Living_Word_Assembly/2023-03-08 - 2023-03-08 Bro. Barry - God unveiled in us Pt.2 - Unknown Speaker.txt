green but you know what's coming I uh I just want to bring you greetings from down south we'll get into that a little bit later tonight I guess but certainly glad to be back if you have a need tonight maybe just make it known unto the Lord with an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your goodness to us Lord father I don't think we would ever have enough words to thank you Father for what you've done for us in this day Lord God we're just so grateful and tonight father we've count this a tremendous honor and a privilege Lord to gather together in the name above every name father Lord we sang the song Lord we desire for you to fill this place with your spirit Lord but father let it not be this building Lord Jesus let it be truly the hearts of your children tonight father let that be the place that you fill with your spirit Lord God outside of that Lord Jesus it's all for naught so father we just asked tonight that you would just fill us with your spirit if we've never had that experience tonight Lord I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you would Grant it and father we pray that Lord many of us myself included we need a filling up Lord Jesus of that oil Lord of your Holy Ghost your spirit Lord Jesus none of us are exempt from it that's why we come to church Lord so we can take our cups and lift them up unto you and say Lord top me up father because I know some time you're coming and unless I'm full of oil I will not be able to go with you father when you take your bride so tonight we just ask father that you would just bless us one more time with your presence father that you would fill us with your spirit that you would bless us with your word father Lord that you would just pour yourself out father without measure tonight Lord knowing that you have just as much and more to give us father as we desire we know that your Prophet said that where there's a deep calling there's a deep to respond and tonight father we deeply call unto you that you would respond father in a mighty way Lord we ask that you admit each request that is made known unto you tonight with an uplift hand father that you would be with those who were traveling father that you would give them traveling mercies father that you would just Lord be with those who couldn't come tonight for whatever the reason Lord Jesus you know and we pray that you would just bless them Father Lord we ask all these things now in the name above every name that our Lord Jesus Christ amen bless you tonight welcome welcome welcome certainly glad to be home and uh excited for the word tonight thank you musicians do you have your Bibles I'd like to read from First Peter chapter 3. similar topic just a different angle talking about husbands and wives and children and Sons and Daughters of God bride of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost the word for our day First Peter chapter 3 verse 1. says likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning of planting planting the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a Meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God a great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement likewise the husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word thank you for this word Lord that was given throughout the ages Lord translated father through many different hands and minds and and mouths Lord Jesus father it's come through so many different channels Lord Jesus but we know that for today it's the word that you had prepared for us before the foundation of the world Lord Jesus so that we could receive it the way that we need to receive it father there's no other word there's no other direction there's no other place that you've provided other than your word and father we take it and we accept it the way that you've given it to us Lord and we just ask now that you would just open our eyes of understanding father that you would just take this bread of life that we have read again one more time tonight and just make it real unto us father Lord we'll be careful to give you all the praise and all the glory we just ask that we could Commit This service now into your hands that you would have the preeminence and all that's said and done in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated I just wanted to bring a couple of announcements um first off we have already achieved or arrived at that place where this Sunday the clocks we go ahead by one hour we lose an hour so our service starts one hour earlier on Sunday morning so uh clock change this this weekend praise the Lord that means springtime uh we have a uh what do we have on the 15th we've got brother Mervin taking the service next Wednesday and we also have a prayer meeting on the 16th we have the 17th is the Youth Event and then uh on the 19th we're actually going to have two Services it'll be one in the morning and one in the afternoon six o'clock and it's going to be a praise and worship service so if you have a special or something you would like to bring by all means come and just Express what's on your heart let the joy of the Lord be your strength just make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord and I'm sure that if you have the right motive and the right objective that he will receive it if we come and we want to do something according to the world or something that we've been influenced from from the outside it's it's maybe not going to be well received but it's for if it's from the inside of the inside then that's where we're going to actually bring a Joyful Noise unto the Lord so on the 19th we're going to have one of those special services again I just think it's wonderful every time we sing that song uh Lord feed your children I can't help but think about brother mental Friesen I remember him singing that song when he was here it just uh does something to me when we sing that song makes me think of the Old Timers the generals that have been on the on the front lines for decades and decades and uh the things that they've gone through and you know just to remain balanced in in the midst of it all not not to skew one way or the other and some people might say that uh some of the old timers get a little bit harder but I think what happens they don't necessarily get harder they get less tolerant for nonsense and I think that that's really uh it's not a bad thing because sometimes you can get caught up dealing with distractions the devil wants anything that can distract our attention he'll use it and and he'll stir something up over here in the church and get us to go over here and try and deal with this thing and while we're dealing with that then he'll stir something up over there and while that's happening over there it's just uh it's just a devil and we recognize his tactics and we know that we have the greatest thing that's ever happened to this world that's the word of God that's what we have and that's what's in our midst and I'm going to bring the quote tonight but brothers and sisters I just want to say it this way I believe that truly we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst we're not looking for a greater word we're not looking for another word some people might be but I'm sorry I can't bring anything different than what the prophet said and I will never intend to I will only Endeavor to bring what the prophet said for our age because somebody has to be the recipient of what the word said for us in our day someone has to be the one that's going to go on the Rapture some people will go on the grave and that's the Lord's choice but we know that they will rise first and and then we who are alive and remain will will gather together with them and meet him in the air meet Jesus Christ in the air and I heard something so fantastic in in in in in in the South this this weekend and I thought it was just good it was brother Wayne it was you know just down home preaching and in the South it was so neat to see him in his element but you know what he said was that the Lord Jesus and there's a quote for it but the Lord has actually there will come a time when the Rapture happens where he just expands Heaven down and what happens is the dimension is not somewhere way out there beyond the universe it's right here that Dimension is right here and this Dimension will slightly speed up and that Dimension will slightly slow down and he will expand Heaven he'll stretch heaven and he'll use that Jacob's Ladder and I'm not going to try and preach his sermon tonight but I just found it so so fascinating because someone is going to be there someone has to be there for the Rapture to happen someone has to be alive on Earth to see the dead come forth from the grace brother Branham said it 30 to 40 days about a month he said 30 to 40 days some some people are going to start seeing people and you know he said it on the weekend brother Wayne did and I just I believe that it goes beyond brother Wayne speaking I believe that it was the Holy Ghost speaker I want to hear from the Lord when I went to church on Sunday and I believe that he spoke to me and he said just any minute now just any minute now don't don't don't be waiting for 10 years or 15 years just live like he's coming right now because any moment now everything in our lives could change I mean we saw it happen with covet here in Calgary just in a moment we heard people talking about it they were talking about it oh yeah there's talk about it there was talk about it but then eventually it happened and everything shut down we've talked about the Rapture we've talked about the message we've talked about the word and one of these days brothers and sisters it's going and I just want to be one of them and I want to try and encourage everyone who is here to be one of them and I'll say it it's not up to us it's not up to me to put anyone in or out I just want to bring as many with me as I can that's all when uh we we had such a wonderful time it was just my goodness thank you for your patience with me to be able to go I I really have something very clear on my heart now um that I've discovered since traveling even when we went to Philippines and and that is it goes back to even Australia when I went there you know maybe it sounds fascinating that I've put on Miles and I've gone to these places and met the people and it's it's neat to say that we've done that but my heart's desire is right here it's not out on the road somewhere traveling I believe that the Lord has a five-fold Ministry for a purpose and people have a desire in their heart to go and travel and to take the word and they're called evangelists some are teachers some can teach here or or away and some are pastors and I think I've just discovered that really my calling is not abroad it's right here this is my desire every time I go away I just can't help but think about here but I want to say tonight to everyone aren't we thankful for the church we have aren't we thankful for the body of Believers we have in Calgary here this is the Lord's work I'll give a hand clap too because it's unto the Lord you know sometimes when we go to a different place and you start to hear some of the different stories in and amongst the churches goodness sakes we are very blessed here brothers and sisters very blessed here and I'm not trying to blow any horn except forgive God all the praise and all the glory we've said it for years I've heard it said there's nothing that would ordinarily take us out of the world if we weren't Believers and make us Fellowship together the thing we have in common here is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but to see the unity in the body here is tremendous God bless each one of you you know I want to say it this way too the devil just wants to get us distracted I've already said it but he wants to get us distracted that's his tactics and he's going to use anything within his power to distract us from the word because there's only one thing that's going to save our bodies change our bodies in this age it's the word the word and the word alone we're not going to be able to do it on our own I caught a tremendous Revelation and I'm not afraid to say it that that it's simply this I thought for the longest time there was some way that I needed to pray there is somehow that I needed to pray there was some thing that I needed to pray in order to see my prayer get answered before the Lord I had to maybe behave good for a week or two or three or four or five or ten or maybe 10 years I had to have a certain Behavior to see the the activation of God's word come to pass in my life if I was to pray for something you know what that's that's not true that's a lie of the devil what that is is its works and we were talking about this before I just think it's so clear the distraction from the devil if if we're we're we're needling on works and saying that this has to happen and if it doesn't happen according to the way that I think it should happen then it's not gonna it's not gonna be the spirit of God if we're doing that brothers and sisters what's happening is we're just getting caught up in in needing milk we need a bottle according to the word of God when we should be at the place where we're eating steaks where we're eating strong meat because the little things aren't going to bother us we're going to come to church and we're going to shout for Joy just like the sons of God shouted for Joy back when job saw before the foundation of the world the morning star sang together and the sons of God Shadow for Joy the prophet in our day said that was us the sons of God were shouting for joy we're going to make a Joyful Noise why wait till we're over there I had a wonderful time away on our commission here now today brothers and sisters is to find that last predestinated seat that's what it is if we're worried about all these other things in in our lives and in the church we're missing the point what what my great Revelation is that I want to tell you is that we don't have anything that we can do in our lives to bring to pass God's word I honestly thought for the longest time that my behavior was either going to activate or deactivate God's word and that's not the case what's going to happen is we're going to pray the prayer of faith and we're going to lay hands on the sick and the word says if you pray the prayer of faith then the Lord shall deliver them if you lay your hands on the sick they shall recover that's it we do our part he'll do his but if we get caught up trying to do his part brothers and sisters he can't do it he's going to stand back and say when are you going to let me do it you're too busy trying to do my part why don't you get into your position and just pray the prayer of faith and just lay your hands on the sick and let them just recover because that's my word it just hit me so hard it's just phenomenal and if anybody else has ever had a revelation like that I say amen and I hope someone else has had a revelation like that I'm not the only one and I know it's not the case and and I don't mean to sound in any way Pious or anything by that but sometimes it's just tremendous to give God the glory because the prophet said that we can never overemphasize the importance of Revelation to a True Believer my goodness I trust that all of us are getting revelation not just tonight but every time we go to church every time you listen to the word every time we we pray we're getting more and more and more that's why we do it it's just wonderful one of the things that came out also just I have oh my I have over 20 pages of nuggets so I'm not going to bore you with them all tonight but one other thing that came down that was just so good good to think about it the wrath of God could not fall on Jericho until who came out the Harlot right and not just the Harlot but for those people who struggle with their families her and her whole family she said give me a token I want to take that token and he said hey if you want it you got it but don't deviate from the from the token here don't deviate from the contract if you're true to your word then you and your family will be saved my goodness she was a harlot she wasn't the most religious person in the city and it's interesting because when spies came to her she said do you know that the whole enemy's Hearts melt within themselves because they know that God that is with you that God that you represent my all of the enemies melt and I I just think it's tremendous because brothers and sisters when we're in our position and we're not trying to bring to pass the word of God in our lives through little works that we want to try and do and little behaviors that we think should happen and all these things that we want to try and bring to pass when we're not doing all that and we're just simply being in our position as Believers as Sons and Daughters of the most high God trusting that he is responsible to bring his word to pass then all the devils in hell are going to melt before you they're going to scatter just like cockroaches when we're in Philippines we turn on the light and open the door in a hotel room and there was a cockroach just scattering for its life but he was a little too slow we had the boys with us so uh anyways enough of the preamble we certainly had a wonderful time and I almost felt guilty because down there they are in full full-fledged spring daffodils are up the grass is green it was about 20 degrees outside and just just an amazing time with the the brothers down there it was held at the apost apostolic Tabernacle in in Newton North Carolina I flew into Charlotte North Carolina and I I got in on Friday night I left Friday morning at about two in the morning I left my house and excuse me I just took the least expensive flight that I could find and it's not always the most convenient but I got there and I was able to get there just in time for the last half of the service while brother Wayne was preaching and uh it was just a wonderful time and what what the whole weekend was geared towards is a Minister's enrichment weekend is what they called it and they just talked directly to pastors and evangelists it was about evangelizing the end time message and and bringing the word of God to the Bride of Jesus Christ and then going into the field and trying to find that last predestinated seed there was so many really good nuggets for evangelists and and pastors so um the pastor of this church is brother Joshua Bennett I don't know if anybody is familiar with him they have quite a mix there they have a church that is made up of three different churches they had their own little church like this and then two other big churches in the area split over the years and so they have thirds and it's an interesting Dynamic but it works for them and they were there in their church for the second weekend and it's a brand new church building I don't have any pictures of it on hand but the building is just tremendous just a beautiful brand new building and the thing that I found encouraging was the place was full Sunday morning it was full and I believe there's probably 400 seats in that sanctuary and it was just loaded and uh yeah just a wonderful time so Pastor Joshua Bennett Josh Bennett sends his greetings to Calgary Living Word he he said make sure you greet the Saints there Lord willing I'd like to get him to come up here I think he's a little bit younger than myself and uh we'll just see Lord willing in time we'll see if he'll come brother Daryl Ward was there it was brother Wayne Lawson and brother Daryl Ward they took the services and they actually spoke to the the ministers that were present so we had a Friday evening service then we had a Saturday morning service and a Saturday evening service and Saturday in the midday after we went had lunch we came back to the church for a question and answer sort of uh discussion and the brother there said that that's a very dangerous thing to do and and I didn't really understand why I'm so thankful that's why I say I'm so thankful for this body of Believers here ignorance truly is bliss there was ministers there with all manner of different full spectrum of ministers in there people from tapes people from from going back to Pentecost to people that completely believe the word and all its its power for our day all the ministers were there there was I don't know maybe 30 or 40 of them and and they said that it was kind of a dangerous thing to open it up to questions and answers but there were some really good encouragement there things that maybe people hadn't thought about and uh I just thought it was so good one little nugget I'll give out for free he talked about to evangelists very specifically if you're not willing this was brother Daryl Ward saying if you're not willing to go and evangelize at a church with six people then you should not be going to a church with 600 because you got the wrong spirit you should be going to all of the Bride if there is someone that's laboring for the word then we need to take it to them so after that we had a Sunday morning service and a Sunday evening service and uh I just want to say you know where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty and uh boy oh boy if we think we're loud here I mean they they they really worship there it was very very different than what we see here very different and I think it was such an amazing sight to see I've seen that one other time at brother Danny steaman's church we went to Sarasota Florida one time and you know what when the spirit of the Lord Falls people can't stand it it's impossible to remain normal when the spirit of the Lord Falls and it doesn't matter who you are or where you're at when you see it happen it's tremendous I've seen a lot of uh Pentecostal behavior that way where you know that it's maybe not exactly according to the word at the time I didn't know it it was just normal for me as a child but to know the message of the hour and to see people behave that way now you say well I get it brother Branham preached you know the anointed ones at the end time brings it out very clearly it's the right anointing it's the same anointing just on the wrong vessel so brothers and sisters I want to say tonight how much more important how much greater is it when we preach the word of God and we worship in spirit and in truth and the spirit of the Lord falls on a group of people we should be able to just Rejoice with Liberty to know that that's the spirit of the Lord Satan don't want no part of that in our midst I just think it's so wonderful and I mean goodness if we can't get excited about this what gets us excited in this world where do we get our Thrills because if this doesn't thrill us then there's a problem I think it's just amazing you know how we ended it brother brother Wayne said to me stick around another day one more day if you can and we'll go and tour the Billy Graham Library and so we did that and you know it might maybe sound carnal and and stuff and maybe some of it was but the reality for me was simply this they call Billy Graham America's pastor and the world's evangelist and the reason for that is the millions of people he led to Christ and many people would say but he didn't lead them to the word uh the word for our day and I'll say yeah he will but you know what I had the overwhelming feeling with when I was at the end of the tour the end of the library was simply this that there's two books right brother Branham says they're two separate and he says that they're one and the same both of those things are in the message of the hour one is The Book of Life people and one is the the Lamb's Book of Life people The Book of Life people can have their name added or taken off blotted on or blotted out and the Lamb's Book of Life people their name was written there before the foundation of the world and you know what if we find our name written there on the Lamb's Book of Life then we are not the ones who are evangelized by these two ministers that went down to Sodom by Oral Roberts or Billy Graham we know that that's what the prophet clearly identified in our day they were the two ministering angels that went down and preached the gospel but they preached to people blind to the truth for our day millions and millions of people the the things that that they showed there it was tremendous you know and I don't know if it would be necessarily his prayer I kind of think it might be one of the things that I saw was the interview and and they interviewed him over and over again I'm sure you could probably find the videos on YouTube if you really wanted to Billy Graham being interviewed by talk show host like Phil Donahue by by oh I can't remember the names but some of the hardliners some of the guys that really try and poke and ask the tough questions and really upset people and you know what he did he simply smiled and said you know what Jesus Christ loves you too and you yourself could be saved if you wanted to all you have to do is just ask him into your heart and he'll save you this moment and and nobody could shake him and all the different interviews he had the same anointing of that ministering Angel to Smite the nation blind while the rest of the Bride just received the word gladly only because he chose her before the foundation of the world it actually moved me to tears to get to that place where I recognized wow look at all these people and they believe they're saved and and truly they are to an extent but they just haven't been called to the calling that maybe everyone has been my goodness I'll just read a couple of quotes about this it just really spoke to me brother Branham he says that's what he did there he was standing there he eat the Flesh of a calf drank the milk from a cow eat bread then the two preachers the angels modern Billy Graham Orel Roberts preachers they had a message for the world so they looked towards Sodom and they went down there not much Miracles done but they blinded the people many people would say well they could see other people could see maybe the people in Sodom could see maybe they couldn't see the word says they were blind I don't want to dispute the fact that maybe their their natural vision was gone or or their spiritual vision was gone the prophet of God is bringing this to a natural time that we're living in the actual age and where we're at saying that it's Billy Graham and Oral Roberts they had a message for the world so they looked towards Sodom they went down there not much Miracles but they blinded the people preaching the gospel does blind the people that's what the Bible says he says look at let's look at this one that was sent to the church called out the elect Abraham's church he said unto Abraham now remember he was a stranger Abraham where is your wife Sarah how did he know he had a wife how did he know her name was Sarah and this is the sign this is the Messianic sign that brother Branham is bringing that he was able to discern the heart and these two Messengers to Sodom they weren't Discerning nothing they were simply going and preaching the gospel and blinding the people to the truth if you were to talk about the prophet of God in our age those people would be shocked they wouldn't have anything to do with it and they won't still another one says he'd come down and I want you to notice two of those angels a modern Billy Graham and so forth went out and preached to the sodomites is that right and there was only one Miracle they performed smiting them blind and the preaching of the Gospel smites blind them who doesn't believe but he showed them that sign to them down there the gospel being preached to come out he didn't call Abraham out I found this to just be beautiful he didn't call Abraham oh did he he was already out oh I'm so glad Abraham represented the elected Church the called out Church but one stayed behind with Abraham and he'd done a sign I want you to see what kind of a sign he'd done to the elected church and I'm not going into that too far tonight but I just wanted to say it very clearly that these two men this this looking at this this whole museum that they built for this man the whole world recognizes Billy Graham and the work that he did he went into the stadium when there was communism communist Russia he was able to get a visa to go into the country but he was forbidden to preach this was back in the 70s and full communism was fully underway there and it shows a picture of him praying in the Olympic stadium in Russia praying and and they said that he prayed that one day maybe he would be able to come and hold a campaign in this stadium and two decades later they have video of him there holding a campaign in that Stadium evangelizing the people blinding them smiting them blind with the word of God it's amazing to think about but you know the Lamb's Book of Life brothers and sisters I just can't help but but go here tonight I just feel it the Lamb's Book of Life equals humility because you can't put your name on it and you can't take your name off it he has called you before the foundation of the world there's something that he has done in your life and you cannot resist the word of God you cannot resist it when it comes to you and and you get that Revelation that we talked about earlier about maybe an area in your life or something about the word or something about the message of the hour when that Revelation strikes your heart humility comes in and you say oh my Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and and whatever I need to do to make it better whatever I need to do to change it I want to do that I don't want to to say oh no I've got it like yeah I've had it for years I don't know what you're talking about I can just remain the same way not the last book of life people the The Book of Life people I would say that because they would say there's some kind of word that I can do there's some kind of work that I can do thank you brother is that a sign I'll take a breath I'm not coughing this time I think it's tremendous but you know the Lamb's Book of Life people they're not puffed up by some kind of a tradition Matthew 15. verse 8. this people drawth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far away from me I would say that's Book of Life people Book of Life people are the ones that really they have a religious covering they they do the same thing that that Adam and Eve did in the garden they know that God's there they they know that there's a word of God but still they have their own idea their own theory that they want to apply instead of just saying be it unto me according to Thy word for the day and you know brothers and sisters I can't express this enough just coming to church and and coming to the message church and and having the message in our lives and and just being a part of an association doesn't put you in that position the only thing that's going to do it is the new birth and the new birth brothers and sisters isn't just saying that I believe Christ died on Calvary and he died and he's going to rise or he rose again and one day he's coming back that's what the evangelists that smote the people blind with that's what they preach but we believe that he's here we believe that he's come we believe that he has actually come through a prophet and represented his word in a way that this world has never seen before this word has been fully opened for verse 9 of Matthew 15 says but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men and and that's I just want to stress that tonight that there's no works that we're going to be able to do we're not going to be able to come and preach the doctrine uh and say this is my tradition and it's going to be good enough you know what that does is it makes us a lodge it makes us an association it it takes the power of God that Dynamic power that you talk we talk about in the it is the rising of the Sun and some of the other messages what it does is it takes that power and it grounds it out and it will pass right by us it won't even have any effect on us if we do that we need to make sure that we are not teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men you know if you're here that's why I don't I don't really want to harp on it too much but to say that you know we're going to come after you if you're not here exactly one half hour before service then something's wrong with you we're going to get the deacons to come to you if you don't turn up for service we're going to send the deacons to your house someone's going to be texting you someone's going to be phoning you there's going to be problems teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men you don't have a tie on just right you're maybe not wearing a jacket your pants your skirts your heels on and on and on we can go but I want to say this brothers and sisters if we get people to Christ truly according to the word for our day if we get the Holy Ghost if we get the new birth we're not going to have to tell anybody anything because they're going to know and you know what if we do say something on the off chance that we do we're going to say oh my okay let me consider that it's not going to be oh my how could you say that to me how am I going to be all offended you know what that is that's not the spirit of Christ the spirit of Christ is going to have unity and want to have the bond of peace endeavoring to keep that Spirit that's what the spirit of Christ is talking about our scripture tonight I'm going to stop with that I just thought it was fascinating fascinating to see the the the the story behind one of those ministering angels that smote that the world blind we know that brother brownham went around the world seven times it's no accident that he went around the world this this word went around the world um but here we have one of those ministering angels that brother Branham said in two quotes one of those men those angels they went around the world too and smote the Nations blind with Christ dying on Calvary and Rising again and just saying that if you prayer Pray the Prayer of Salvation that you're going to be saved and all is going to be well and you can just carry on however you want it's not the case but it's not for everyone either we've been called to a special place and I just think it's wonderful to recognize our provided place of worship in our day is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever it's not saying that we worship brother Branham we worship that that that light that was above Brother Brad and we worship the god that allowed himself to be captured in that picture one time we worship the god whose face we see if you look at it properly if you turn it right you see his face inside that cloud that's the God we worship the god that William Mary and Branham came and represented and said don't don't look at me look at him I must decrease so that he must increase that's the god that we worship tonight talking about our scripture I just think it's such a beautiful thing going back to our our study about husbands and wives we've got a few minutes left I apologize for taking so much time talking about that but you know in uh in verse one I just think it's so wonderful looking at this likewise out of First Peter chapter three likewise he wives be in subjection to your own husbands and you know that semicolon is there and the semicolon I just think it's interesting when you look at that there's no accidents with punctuation in the word of God there's no accidents with with capitals and and and with lower case it's all for a very specific purpose this the small punctuation mark the semicolon in grammatical terms represents a place where a sentence could end but it continues on likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word that they Also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives meaning that the wives can actually do something for their husbands the wives have the ability even if their husbands aren't actually on the word even if their husbands are actually outside of their position even if the husbands I'll say it this way and I'll just say it this way even if the husbands are wrong because sometimes they are even if the husbands are wrong if that wife is willing to actually stay in her position and follow the word of God then what will happen is she can actually save her husband she can actually do something to prevent Calamity in their lives it's such a beautiful beautiful thought I just I just think it's amazing you know we will we could just read the scripture we'll just carry on with it there verse 2 says while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear while who beholds your Chase conversation coupled with fear yeah the husbands the family children everyone around that's one of the biggest things is the family conversations the family conversations we can say what we want when we're in public in front of everyone but the truth comes out children are honest children say what happens around the dinner table and you know we don't want to have different conversation around the dinner table and think well we've got our private sanctuary and we can just say whatever we want you know we believe the word of God but we could just say what we want you know there was a group of people that did that one time and a whole bunch of children lost their lives two she Bears came in from the prophet and brother Branham said it very clearly it was from their dinner time conversation from the way those parents talked about the prophet and the prophet's Ministry but it's that that that people who actually see that behavior in that wife and and I just think let's let's take it and zoom out maybe from the the natural spiritual let's just go spiritual and say the wife the wife the one who maybe thought that she could do something and and cause the word of God cause her husband's word to come to pass nope the chase conversation is you know what I just simply put myself in my position and I trust his word with all my heart and it's up to him he's obligated to only one thing not my behavior he's obligated to his word and his word is what will come to pass in due time if I'm willing to put that first in my life my Chase conversation can cause his word to come to pass it sounds like maybe I'm I'm saying one thing and and saying a total opposite thing I'm not I'm saying that the only thing that I can do as his bride is simply say it's his word and his word alone that's all humble myself to his word verse 3 who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plating of the hair and wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but not not doing something on our own not trying to muster something up and and make it happen we can't do that on our own it's got to be the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives it has to be him doing it it's got to be washed white not whitewashed right we need to make sure that it's not an outward adorning that's making us who we are it's actually the life that comes from when inside of us and and I don't even know if I have the quote here but you know Jesus said to his disciples it's not what actually goes into the man that defiles his body according to the law we know that it says it is right if they ate pork or they ate anything unclean according to the law for their day that's what defiled them but Jesus said it's what comes out of the mouth that defiles the man so we need to be careful what we speak talking about the third poll third pole people Book of Life people we've got the third pull in our midst we understand the power of the spoken word one day we're going to speak meals maybe restore limbs have all this stuff but but do we get ourselves caught up in the negative context of talking negative about things and speaking things that aren't according to his word it's that chase conversation brothers and sisters that's going to make things happen verse 4 says but let it be the hidden man of the heart I thought we were talking about wives here Let It Be The Hidden man of the heart in in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God a great price so we can say this this scripture has a compound meaning and revelation we can say sure enough it's talking about a wife that's the way I want my wife to be yeah she has the ornament of a Meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God a great price every husband wants their wife to be that way but what about us as his wife are we putting ourselves in that position because if we're not putting ourselves in that position that don't even bother talking about your wife like that I I don't know maybe I'm going too far by saying that but I just believe it with all my heart we have got to be the one setting the example in our homes and if we're not doing it talk us cheap brothers and sisters we've got to be the ones that are really setting the example how are our children ever going to learn the behavior that they need to follow according to the word of God if we're living something different it's got to be that hidden man of the heart the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ so how can we ever live the word of God we can't that's why people get so upset about the message of the hour you'll never be able to live it never but when that hidden man of the heart when he starts living out through your life you will start to actually live this word and you know it's going to be the life lived it's not going to be the sermon preached we can talk all we want but we've got to be able to live it and the only way we're going to live it is to have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives Bar None there's no action that we can do go on to verse 5 for after this manner in the old time the holy women who trusted in God adorned themselves being subjection unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are he just goes in and out of it being spiritual and natural I just love it even Sarah or who obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any amazement don't be afraid of the word of God just let the word of God live out in your lives but then it goes into kind of what I wanted to get into tonight likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor to the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of that Grace of life that your prayers be not hindered we have talked about this in the past and how the husbands can sometimes say well she's the weaker vessel she was the one that was tempted she was the one that was deceived Adam wasn't uh the wife maybe my wife could be deceived but I can't I I would say this in in a lot of cases brothers and sisters some of the women are just a little sharper than some of the men and I'm not saying that in a way that that I mean it to be bad but I'm just saying women are not stupid women are not dumb women are very very smart and we need to honor them we need to give honor unto them we need to dwell with them according to knowledge and giving honor unto the wife as being the weaker vessel and recognizing that it was Eve that was deceived Adam went willingly understanding by knowledge by teaching how do we get knowledge we get knowledge by teaching we get knowledge by reading we get knowledge by hearing the word of God we need to know that the wife is the weaker vessel spiritually speaking I know people would maybe challenge me on that but that's why the husbands have to be the ones actually digging in and being the ones who are strong in in the word and making sure that they're fortifying their house fortifying their family we can't be bringing things into our homes and saying it's okay it's like in the olden days if we have a castle and we've got it fortified we've got all the gates and everything if the king were to bring in a bad guy and say it's okay you could just come into the castle and just be here with us you know you're friendly and I kind of like you the way you make me laugh and and all these different things maybe there's some fun stuff that he does you can just come in and dwell with us what's going to happen when that bad guy gets in the castle he's going to start finding out secrets and telling weak stories about weaknesses and he's going to send messages to his buddies and eventually he's going to start bringing friends into the castle as husbands as fathers we've got to be doing that four to five buying our homes with the word of God we can't bring worldly into our home and think that we're going to be spiritually strong we're going to be looking for a solution in the wrong way we'll we'll just be taking ourselves backwards we have to recognize that we are the ones We're The Gatekeepers the husbands are The Gatekeepers husbands dwell with them according to knowledge being smarter than this world smarter than the devil that's going to come around and maybe try and deceive our wives spiritually speaking giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and being heirs together of the grace of life not just one not just the other but both heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered I just think it's such a beautiful thing because what he's saying here is just get in your position get in your position spiritually and naturally when we're in our position we're going to see the lord of the Lord move in our lives then we'll see our prayers not hindered it's possible that our prayers are hindered though brothers and sisters because of the way he words this that your prayers be not hindered verse 8 finally be all of One mind having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful and courteous talking about the wife and the husband just being kind one to another and not having hurtful words I'm angry so I can just have hurtful words I can just speak Angry Words and it's going to be okay it's not going to be okay brothers and sisters it's not going to be okay it's not it's going to hurt and it can take a long time for the hurt to disappear we sow seeds with our mouth it's not what goes into the mouth remember that defiles a man it's what comes out but we need to be of one mind we're on the same teen having compassion one for another love his Brethren be pitiful and courteous if someone trips and falls be pitiful and be courteous and help them up if you see that they're going to trip and fall clear the path call out to them hey that's going to be bad don't go that way that's you're gonna you know we have the ability to do that and verse 9 I think is the most critical for all of this not rendering evil for evil this world says evil for evil and people some people would say well an eye for an eye right well that's the Old Testament law if you want to live under the law you're going to die under the law but if you want to live under grace the word that we're talking about tonight then you're going to be pitiful and you're going to be courteous we're going to behave that way according to the word not rendering evil for evil well you did this to me so I can do that to you or I never got this so you can't have that or or this or that all of that is is is I would say it's Child's Play if we're actually behaving like that in our homes in our marriage in our relationships you know we need to we we need to we need to read this word not rendering evil for evil or rallying railing for railing sorry not rallying but railing for railing the contrary wise blessing knowing that ye are there unto called that ye should inherit a blessing I'm I'm going to inherit a blessing so I don't want to render evil because maybe my wife renders evil to me I I want to bless her and I'm sorry I I'm not saying that she does but I think she looks after me in an incredible way and just to be honest since we've started talking about all of this husbands and wives our marriage has changed it's been tremendous and I think it's beautiful I just will be totally completely transparent with it all and I hope it's okay with everyone but I only ever want to be that way I never want to have anything hidden from anyone if if anybody feels like maybe there is but you know talking about all of this there was a time where I thought you know I understand that we need to have uh uh teaching solid teaching and encouragement about marriage and and positions in the home and everything and and I thought well we could probably get a good minister to come in I know a few that probably could bring a whole series and maybe have a seminar and a learning session and it might not be a bad idea to do that but I believe the Lord spoke to me and said what about you you can bring somebody in but if you can't talk about this if you don't know this then it's not going to do any good to bring somebody else in so that's where I was humbled and I thought boy it's time for me to actually dig in and do some learning and I truly have it's been wonderful and and what it's done is allowed me to get into my position a little better and in doing so it causes everyone to fall in line with the word it's not actually saying that you need to get in line with the word to anyone in the home as a husband we're the trendsetter We're The Gatekeepers we're the ones that actually set excuse me we set the example for this verse 10 says for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile it's not what goes in it's what comes out verse 11 says let him issue evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it let them find peace and and when maybe we start to get upset we do something different about it I I found a quote in in in the in the message when I was down there and I thought it was so interesting about you know just Birds Brother Brad I'm talking about the Robin and how the robin they probably look at humans and they say I wonder I don't know how brother Branham says it exactly I'll just paraphrase it quickly for time's sake but brother Branham says he talks about the robins and how they consider human beings and and how the human beings they get high blood pressure and he says I bet you never one want not not one Robin has ever had to go to the hospital for high blood pressure not one Robin has ever died of a heart attack because of a temper not one Robin has ever had an issue in their lives according to what the human condition is but here these humans they suffer from all of this and you know what it is it's a distraction the devil wants to just get us distracted if he can do it then we're going to actually have words that come out of our mouths they're going to cause problems and those problems are going to give the devil a day off and and all we're going to do is be going in circles running on our hamster wheel and we don't have to do that we can just focus on this word let us issue evil just like job we know that he was upright in the sight of God he he was fine in all of his ways and he he was a man who issued evil if he saw Evil coming his way he did everything he could to get out of the way so he could go around it brother Brown I'm in the church age book talking about the knowledge the word Smyrna out of the Sumerian Church age it means bitter being derived from the word myrrh myrrh was used in embalming the Dead thus we have a two-fold significance found in the name of this age it was a an IT twofold significance found in the name of this age it was a bitter age filled with death two Vines within the framework of the church we're drifting further apart with an increased bitterness toward the True Vine on the part of the false I just can't help but think you know brother Bradham says it very clearly he says that when the bride starts to declare the wheat starts to declare I and my father are one then the shuck will start to pull away the wheat's not going to pull away but the shock's gonna start saying now there you go making yourself God again but don't don't you realize that I know all your faults and failures I can see your flesh and I can see your parents and I know your lineage I know all about you but you go and make yourself God one of these days brothers and sisters the Rapture is going to go it's gonna happen brother Bradham says out of this quote here the two Vines within the framework of the church were drifting further apart with an increased bitterness toward the True Vine on the part of the false death was not only the seed of the false Vine but even in the True Vine there was a creeping paralysis and impotence because they had already drifted from the unadulterated truth of the first few years after Pentecost brother Branham says and no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive then his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God what's the pure word of God in our day brothers and sisters it's the message of the hour it's understanding this knowing that our knowledge of it and adherence to it is what will make the difference in our lives and when we read this scripture here where if if we deal with our wives according to knowledge how are we going to deal with our wives I think this just takes it to a whole new level we're not talking about dealing with our wives according to the knowledge we're going to pick up from from reading books from the library and and maybe study materials we might get in University anything outside of the message of the hour brothers and sisters anything outside of the message of the hour brothers and sisters is the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil this is from Satan anything in the message of the hour is going to be of the word this is the knowledge that we're talking about when we read this scripture verse 7 we can say there's a psychological aspect and there is there's things that we deal with in our bodies and there are there's different chem buckles that get released and they happen but you know what the only thing that's going to Deliver Us from them all is the word of God that's the only thing no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive than his knowledge of an adherence to the pure word of God as seen by multitudes of examples in the Old Testament organization was growing a pace confirming and augmenting the death of the membership for the Holy Ghost leadership was deposed and the Word was replaced by Creeds dogmas and man-made ritual and I just want to say tonight brothers and sisters if we've got a list of do's and don'ts that we think we should or shouldn't do and that's what's holding us together that's what's keeping us going with the word of God maybe just take a step backwards and ask God to fill you with his holy spirit because if we're looking at do's and don'ts we've actually I want to say this and maybe we'll have a discussion about it I like it we should if we're doing do's and don'ts brothers and sisters I truly believe with all my heart we don't have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives because if we've got the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we're just going to be at rest we're just going to know that God's going to work it all out for his glory you know if you want to challenge that let's take a look at the the woman who was taken and thrown at Jesus feet she was caught in the act of adultery if you want to talk about works she should have been taken out and stoned but I heard somebody say it recently they took her to the wrong man was it your brother that said that they brought her to the wrong man they brought her to Grace they didn't realize it but he was there to atone for all of that sin for all of that natural ability you know the only thing that God wants he wants our spirit he wants our soul he wants all of us except for one thing and that's our natural ability he doesn't want anything to do with our natural ability if we've got a natural ability he wants to take us take it and throw it away because he can't use us for his glory and that was one of the things they brought out about Ministry if we're going to preach the gospel he doesn't want any of us he doesn't want our natural ability our natural ability is going to get in the way of the word of God but all of this the Holy Ghost leadership was deposed put aside just dismissed you know what they're just a little bit fundamental we're getting a little bit too loud in the service we need to just push aside the Holy Ghost leadership and actually replace it with what we had you know what this one time we we had service and and it was so good and it was just this way and it can be anything that happens it can be really louder it can be really quiet but if we saw the Lord God move in that moment and we said you know what we need to just replicate that we need to sing the same song we need to play the same way we need to do it just this way when we start to get our man-made ideas in there brothers and sisters we're limiting God we're grounding out the power that Dynamic power of the Lord Jesus Christ from moving in our midst we don't want to depose the Holy Ghost leadership in our lives we want to loose the Holy Ghost leadership in our lives We Want To Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord we're not interested in Creed's dogmas or man-made rituals we want to see the liberty of the Holy Ghost live in our our services live in our homes live in our families we want to see the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives I've been looking at the the book of Jeremiah and the the Prophet Jeremiah and what he had to go through it's a tremendous story but to know I just was so so so shocked when I saw this there's there's a bunch of scriptures in Jeremiah where he talks about pastors specifically and every one of them he talks about how the children of Israel had fallen away they'd they'd deposed the spirit the Holy Ghost spirit in their day now just bear with me I know the Holy Ghost wasn't yet given but he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new is the Holy Ghost in you we know that we're talking about Elohim that self-existing one and the way that he chose to express himself and and their way their day was the word they were given according to the law but they had set aside all of that and decided to do their own thing and Jeremiah was called out and told to go and tell these people you know what unless you're willing to repent and get back to that true word that original direction that God has given you are going to be destroyed and he cried out and cried out and cried out it's just the sort of the the cause notes version of it but eight times pastors are mentioned in the book of Jeremiah I believe maybe at seven and one is in Ephesians but this six of them in Jeremiah are crying out you're wrong you need to get back to the word but only one of them says and I will give you pastors according to Mine Heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding there's a purpose for having a five-fold Ministry there's a purpose for having a pastor and a church that you call your own if you don't have that brothers and sisters how are you going to find that knowledge and gain that understanding what you're doing is deposing the Holy Spirit and saying I want to create a Dogma or some other way some tradition that I think is going to work for me but it won't work it won't work brother Branham says I am the word if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word I just think this this brings it down right home to where we live maybe just just to me where I live but don't don't if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word and I'll say it this way welcome and receive the message of the hour welcome and receive it and what will happen is you'll welcome and receive the holy ghost in your life if you follow this message of the hour but if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word I just think it's beautiful it's tremendous this which I am giving you brother Branham has in Brackets the word is a revelation of myself now I said that in in such a way that sounded like it was brother Branham but it's not brother Branham it's Jesus Christ the word in Brackets is a revelation of myself I am the word remember that the church age book here you know there's a part of it where brother Brown was told to pick up his pen and write I'm not going to read that tonight but just to sort of verify who is talking when we read this stuff when we read quotes when we talk about the message of the hour who is talking it's not just a man it's not just William Mary and Branham it's not just a message it's Jesus Christ expressing himself in word form in in life in living people in the ministry for the people in their day brother Branham goes on to say I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst if we're looking for a Creed or a Dogma Lord help us don't ever let it be found in our midst here not not in our camp as long as I'm around if there's a Creed or a Dogma we need to get rid of it the only Creator the only Dogma that I would want to see is that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever would be alive and well in every one of our lives and every one of our hearts and if anybody ever needs more of him there's more of him to be had the only thing we need to do is just ask for him just invite him and and he will come and and the Beautiful part about it brothers and sisters is we are just a little group and we're talking about the Lord Jesus Christ and and we have these great evangelists that have gone around and around the world and talk to millions of people and change the hearts and millions of people but they will never be able to receive the word that we receive that we have the ability to hear and to receive it's it's just a tremendous thought tonight I just can't I just can't even express the the feeling of of of overwhelming joy to recognize what we have in our midst we have got such a tremendous opportunity brothers and sisters and that opportunity is just to encourage that word in one another encourage that word in our homes and you know if I have said anything that really has upset anyone I'm certainly open to discussion I really don't ever want to do that I just want to encourage us for a closer walk with Christ because that's the only thing that's going to help us in our homes that's the only thing that's going to help us in our our our school and our business and everything that we conduct ourselves in because really what it comes down to is it's not what we do it's not what comes out of out of out of our actions in our lives it's what comes out of our mouths that's what's going to make the difference and if we can have the confession of the word if we can have that chaste conversation I believe that we have the opportunity to see the Lord move in a great way I'm not interested in pushing us back to Pentecost I just want to say this that penny cost was an experience it wasn't a denomination and when that experience happens in our lives brothers and sisters you can't hardly contain it you can't hardly contain it when the spirit of Christ comes on the scene you have a reason to shout you have a reason to move and I've said it before in the past I'll keep saying it as long as we're here we have every right to worship God according to the Revelation that he's given us in in this building here that's why this building is here it's not so that we can come here and and see Jesus Christ if you come to this building looking for Jesus Christ we're missing it we bring Jesus Christ with us that's why we need to come prayed up that's why we need to come maybe a few minutes early so that we can clean out all the things in our lives but the reason we come to this building is so that we can shout so loud that the people outside can potentially hear us that's what this building has created for a place that we can worship God in spirit and in truth without fear and not have to worry this is the place where we can let off the pressure where we can actually really give him the praise and the glory that he desires so if you ever want to shout don't be shy do you ever want to just give God praise don't don't be bashful this is the place to do it if there was ever a place brothers and sisters this is it right here I'm not trying to pull you you just do what the Lord leads you to do but if someone gets excited don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't get worried about it just trust the Lord because this is like I said brothers and sisters this this is not an environment where devils like to be they don't like to be where the Lord Jesus Christ is and when we come into a place like this and we start worshiping God the Devils want to try and get in the way they're gonna they're gonna say no you got that problem remember your arm is sore you can't lift it to God or maybe your voice is sore and if you sing too loud you're not going to be able to talk on Monday and all these different reasons and things are going to come your way and it's just going to be to hinder you from worshiping but when you see that thing when you hear that thing and when you actually say I know my arm is going to hurt if I lift it and and give God the praise and the glory but when you do that when you push Beyond it when brother Branham he says it do the opposite when you have a feeling when you start doing that brothers and sisters all those Devils fall off your arms because they're grabbing onto your arms and they're pulling your arm down real hard to keep you from worshiping because your man better upset or your arm is sore whatever it is push through and actually go forwards and watch the Lord Watch What Happens watch and see if the Lord doesn't receive your worship push those Devils out I'm going to ask you to stand tonight I won't keep you any longer we'll invite the musicians brother Branham he he said it I I I'm wondering if we're sufficiently impressed with the word and I I just wonder brothers and sisters if we are sufficiently impressed with the word if we are sufficiently impressed with the word then we've got every single reason in our lives to rejoice to sing Glory unto the Lord because we know what he's done for us we know what this word is we know it's the pearl of great price and and we know that story about the man when he found that pearl of great price he gave it all away everything that he had he had no desire for it anymore there was no need to hang on to anything because he found that pearl of great price when we find this word for our our lives and our families and our homes boy oh boy there's nothing that's going to hold us back from it you love them tonight let's just go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness to us Lord thank you Father that you would give unto us pastors Lord that would that would lead us according to knowledge father that they would Lord be able to take us and and guide us the direction that we need to go father I want to thank you for a pastor that took me and and led me Lord Jesus and gave me the ability to recognize my position to recognize who I am father I know that he's with you in your house tonight and father I pray that you would just be glorified in all Lord Jesus that he taught and all father that he did Father we know it wasn't in vain we thank you for brother Ken Lord thank you for your goodness to us Lord thank you for all the good pastors that are out there father the Shepherds that you have called from before the foundation of the world to fill the positions that they're in Lord all of the Evangelist Lord Jesus all of the teachers father Lord what an amazing thing it is to stand for you in this age Lord in this age of confusion Lord this age where all of the lines in the world are blurred father every country we know now is affected by the Sodom condition Lord whether it's it's by social media creeping in or whether it's by the changing of the laws we know that no country is exempt from all of that but we also know that every single country in this world has heard about the message of the hour father Lord Jesus we know that while the enemy comes in like a flood you have designed Lord Jesus a bride that will be raised as a standard above that flood of the enemy father and we know that that is your bride Lord and I pray that tonight father not as Noah pitched with with pitch father tonight I pray that we could pitch ourselves with your spirit Lord Jesus father that we would rise above every fanatical every fanaticism every single sinful nature every single problem and issue Lord that we would be able to transcend all of that Lord and just see you father Lord I pray that we would be able to look at one another husbands and wives children and parents father brothers and sisters that we would look at one another and see Jesus Christ that we would not see Badger skins Lord that we wouldn't see ramskins died red but that we would see Jesus Christ that we would be able to turn the picture of each one of us Lord in our lives to turn it right and see you father Lord that we wouldn't be stumbling at the veil father help us if we're stumbling at the veil Lord Jesus I pray that you would just take us and and give us other just a fresh filling of your spirit Lord where we have kindness Lord and compassion and Tender Mercies one to another father just like you have for each one of us Lord father we know that your Prophet was was in that position where he was in that Diner Lord and he saw that vision of the sinful people in that Diner and he saw oh father he saw your face and he saw the the sins hitting your face and and he said are those sins those sins of those sinful people and you said no they're your sins as the prophet they're your sins hitting my face how much more do I protect those people father I pray that we would have the desire to recognize our position and outside of you and your protection that bumper of blood that you provided Lord oh Father every one of us would be doomed father tonight I pray that you would just be glorified in all that we say and do as we go forwards Lord that we would consider the magnitude that we would consider the gravity of having your Holy Spirit in us oh Father not just with us and not just come and have a good anointed service Lord but that we could bring you to each service and take you with each service and take you to our homes and take you to our work and take you to our school and take you to our private places Lord where we can just be ourselves and father change our our Natures Lord change our very Natures where we would desire to look at that thing that that desire would just fall away father when we desire to say a certain thing but that desire would change and we would just have compassion one for another father we just ask that you would go with us now as we go our separate ways father we love you and we thank you and father we could never give you enough praise and glory and honor for what you've done for us in this day Lord to know that you have a Lamb's Book of Life and you have a book of life and father some people were placed on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and father there's nothing they could do to put their name there take it off father we love you and we thank you tonight we ask all these things in the name above every name
