And as we gather even at the closing of time, Father, we realize the battle lights are drawn, Father. And we come this morning to show which side we are on. We come to declare victory. Father, when we sing, when we shout, when we say that we shall not be moved, we are not talking of our ability. We are talking about confidence in your power to deliver. We are talking about our faith in your word. So father as we gather this morning comes once more. Manifest yourself once more. Do as you please. Oh Lord. Take control of this service. Father forgive our mistakes, forgive our weaknesses and shall father and and be pleased with the service with pleased with the praise. Be pleased with every aspect of this service oh God. And when you come among us, Father, bless your children, Father. Grant us revelation in your word, oh God. Give us a heart of understanding to receive substance of eternal value from you. Because that is why we gather here, oh Lord. Have your way in all we do, Father. And at the end of it all, we shall not forget to thank you, Father. Bless the musicians and the singing goes forth. Bless the preaching of the word and the listening, Father. Every aspect of this service, Father, may it be pleasing to you. We love and appreciate you, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. Father, even as the Titan offerings are coming, Father, may you bless it to your glory in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, just a few announcements. Um, uh, let's remember brother Mvin for 24th of August is taking the service and on the 30th and 31st is brother Danny Delundo. So the 30th will be in the evening. Now on the same 31st, which is a Sunday, there is that picnic at Prairie Winds. Yeah, Prairie Winds Park. September 7th, Brother Gift Marufu, who was formerly in Saskatchewan will be here. Um 12, 13th, and 14th, Brother Andrew Glover. So 7:30 on the Friday, 6:00 p.m. on the Saturday, and Sunday morning as well. And then November have it in mind 22nd 23rd. Brother Kyra Js, God bless you. [Music] And these are the days of Elijah declaring the word of the Lord. When only heard the voice of the seventh angel righteousness being restored. And for these are days of great tri. Oh famine and darkness has fall. We are the voice in the desert. Prepare the way of the Lord. Be holy. Oh, riding all the time. Oh, shining like the sun. The trumpet. Oh, let's go. Oh, is the hero jubilee. Oh, still salvation come. And these are the kings of Ezekiel. The trials becoming as flesh were and these are the king of the threeling the temple of gra. Oh, and these are the taste of the harvest. The fields are as riveting your word. And we are your neighbors in your fingert [Music] sound. There's no God like Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah. The glory comes over running. Oh, shining like the sun. I had the trumpet. [Music] Oh, is the year of heart salvation. Behold, behold he [Music] shining like the sun. I have to trump before your voice to believe. For out of hill salvation comes. Amen. You may have receipts. Brother Don, if you can bring your special Amen. Lord bless you all. I pray this blesses someone else as much as it blessed me when it came to me earlier this week. It's called sweet communion. I wake to the sunlight, but brighter still are the thoughts that the spirit begins to fill. Not just in my study or kneeling in prayer, but all through the morning, his voice is there. I'm washing the dishes. I'm walking the street. Yet heaven is whispering, gentle and sweet. A verse from the Bible, a line from the word becomes so alive like a song I've heard. The message I read just the night before opens again as I walk through the door. The seed that he planted now becomes blooms in my heart with colors and truth of the heavenly part. I'm driving to work and my heart takes flight on thoughts of his mercy, his power, his light. The traffic may slow, but his spirit flows free and feeds me with things that no eye can see. The way he weaves it is perfect and true and sure. Each thought is a promise, comforting and pure. They anchor my steps. They brighten my tone. They make even strangers feel like my own. The day's little trials don't trouble me long. For my heart haunts a steady, unending song. Not made by the world, nor fading away, but born of the spirit and fresh every day. So walking or working at rest or at pace, I'm living each moment in his embrace. The word is my bread and his thoughts are my wine and they turn common hours into moments divine. And when night has come and the stars fill the skies, the thoughts still are blooming where his seed lies. For this is the life the bride loves to live, receiving each thought that our Lord longs to give. Lord bless you all. [Applause] Amen. What a blessing. If you please please stand with me as we change the order of the service, just the the course. Amen. We've all been there where that one anchor is all that holds us. Amen. The songs I believe this the writer was so inspired when he wrote the song. It always it's always a powerful meaning, a powerful feeling every time we sing it. Amen. We've all been there. Oh, the anchor hold. Though the ship is battered, [Music] the anger holds. Though the sails are to I have fallen on my knees as I life's raging seas the anger in spite in spite of The storm. The anchor holds. The anchor holds. Though the ship is bashful. That's our testimony this morning. Holy anor [Music] sails. Though the sails. Aren't we a blessed people this morning? Oh, I have fallen all night high. Oh, as I face life's rage, the anor in spite of the storm. One more time. Holy anchor. [Music] Amen. Though the ship is patch or we thought we were lost, the anchor holds [Music] the sails. Oh, I have fallen on mine. Oh, as I face life's raging sea, the anor in spite just our voices. Oh, the anchor, he loves his praise. Though the ship is batter, [Music] &gt;&gt; oh, [Music] &gt;&gt; let's sing this testimony. &gt;&gt; Though the s are to [Music] I have fallen on mine. Oh, as I life's raging sea the anor in spite of the storm. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we serve a living God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Going home as brother Barry comes. [Music] I'm going home. Yes, I'm going home. There is nothingless to hold me here. Bless you. Bless you. How a glimpse of my Oh, praise God. I am going going home and I Oh yes, we are going. &gt;&gt; There is nothing There is nothing to hold. What could it be for our hearts? Oh my heart. Oh my heavenly. &gt;&gt; Oh praise. I am going home. Wonderful. Going home. I'm going home. There's nothing [Music] here. I want a glimpse of my heavenly home. Praise God. I am going home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. Welcome each and everyone to the house of the Lord. My goodness, what an honor and a privilege it is to gather together in his name freely knowing that we don't have to suffer persecution as some do. This morning we just have some prayer requests that uh I wanted to bring. Firstly, we wanted to bring a praise report to the body. Brother Peter uh wanted to bring a praise report. He says, "I'm thanking the Lord for healing me of malaria." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [Applause] He says, "I also want to thank the church for your prayers and for your encouraging words." He was just in Ghana and uh a mosquito must have got him. I guess we can say now, Brother Peter, you're truly Canadian. We're certainly thankful that we can bring praise reports instead of just a laundry list of needs to the Lord. I'd just like to continue to remember my mom, Sharon Clark, who's in the Peter Law Heath Center. She needs a touch from the Lord. want to pray for the Hebington family. Uh this young man, 37 years old, Jesse Hebington, has uh has uh a very grim prognosis, naturally speaking. I'm going to go and visit him after service, Lord willing, and uh hopefully have some words of encouragement for him. But uh if something doesn't change, he'll be going home in a matter of days. We certainly want to I just want to ask that we could remember these two requests and uh all those who are traveling. If you have a need this morning, maybe just defy gravity and make it known unto him by the way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we are so thankful that we can gather together in your name according to your word. Where two or three are gathered, we know that you're there. So, Father, we welcome you here because we already declared this meeting to be in your name and there's many. Father, we're so thankful that we can come to you with our needs. But Lord, more than anything, we're so thankful that you are God, that we know you as our God. Father, we just want to thank you for the needs that you allow to happen in our lives, Lord. They're the the reason that we understand that you you have many attributes because of the needs that we have, Lord. the complex problems and situations that we just as humans can't figure out. We know that you're more than able to. So, Father, we just pray that you would meet each and every need that was made known unto you today by the way of an uplift hand. Father, we thank you for meeting those needs. Lord Jesus, we just want to remember my mom one more time, Sharon Clark. We thank you for touching her body. Thank you, Lord Jesus, that she is so willing to speak to you, Father. What an encouragement it is. We pray that you would just bring her comfort even now in that hospital. And Father, we just want to remember the Hebington family, Jesse Hebington. Lord, without a touch from you, he will be changing his location. Lord, we know that, Father, we can really never die, but we just change our location. Death is just a buggy, Lord. that's designed to take us from one dimension to another. And Father, we pray that you would just be with the Hebington family, be with Michelle and her children, Lord. And even Jesse as he prepares, Lord. Father, we just love you and we thank you, Lord. We pray for those who are traveling today. There's many from our midst who are gone. And it's amazing because you just bring more into our midst, Lord. Father, we thank you for the lives represented here. We pray that you would just watch over our travelers that are here, Lord, and be with those who are away. That you would just bless each one's time, Lord. And Father, now as we turn to your word, we pray that you would just be glorified in all that's said and done. Lord, we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Thank you, musicians. God bless you all. Well, if you have your Bibles, I would just like to read from Genesis and uh carry on in our our discussion around the uh covenant. I just cannot get away from the thought of the covenant. and uh we'll just I guess get into it. But out of Genesis chapter 17, this is when Abram, he still had not received a name change. He was still the old man. It's just beautiful how the Lord does things, isn't it? When we were yet dead in sins and trespasses, that's when he came and made himself known to us. &gt;&gt; Not when we were perfect saints sitting in the church, saved and sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost. It's no different. But I love the way that the Bible is written because it it starts the covenant back when he was the old man. In verse seven of Genesis chapter 17, God speaking here. He says, "And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a god unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, just the way that we read this scripture here, Father, we invite you to be our God. Lord, we just invite you to come by our way and Father, open this this word to us. Lord, we know that the only way we're ever going to be able to understand this word is by revelation from you. And we know that no school of theology could ever teach that revelation. And we know that's what you told your disciple. Father, we just ask that you would break this open to us fresh once again. That you would minister to our souls. that when we leave here today, we would say truly that you spoke to us as you walked with us along the way. &gt;&gt; We just love you and we thank you. We ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. You may be seated. We just like to welcome all of our visitors. I probably will miss someone but the ables's my brother John Perazark. God bless you and your family. Certainly wonderful to have the uh hoofers here with us. Sister Pamela, God bless you. Did you bring your husband today? He's working. Yeah, certainly wonderful to see everyone. uh brother Marco, the Carpan family, and we have the Hinkles with us, some special guests. And uh for those people that might recall, we had prayer once upon a time for my cousin Troy Hinkle. And uh here he is. Certainly wonderful to see what the Lord can do. You know, brother brother Marco has been a a strong witness in Fort McMurray and and the area up there. And it's just incredible to see how the Lord does things. But when he first mentioned that he was witnessing to these people, I was just fellowshipping over at Brother Mvin's house and I heard this name Hinkle and I said, "Man, I haven't heard that name for years." And I don't know if that's the same person or not even. And uh so we began talking and and uh through the process of time come to find out that back and forth yes indeed it's uh he's from my my home in Claris home Alberta and uh we went on vacation together. I'll never forget it. Car broke down and we had an extended stay down in uh down in the Crestston area. Just a wonderful wonderful time. But we're certainly thankful to have you here with us and I trust you feel right at home today. I'll stop talking about you because I don't want you to make you any more uncomfortable. we can get into the word today and uh certainly thankful for this word and the thought about the covenant and you know we have been taking the the discussion about the covenant that God gave to Abram and uh we know that he gave him this covenant in a few different places and told him that if he would just follow him that he would grant him a possession that there would be an inheritance and it would be an everlasting covenant. And we know that that covenant that was mentioned here in Genesis 17 so many thousands of years ago is still in force today. &gt;&gt; That very same covenant is still in force today. We know it's an everlasting covenant. So it's not in force forever because it's not eternal. There's only one thing that's eternal and that is God's own life, Zoey, God's life. But this is an everlasting covenant that as long as there is time, there is a covenant. &gt;&gt; And I think it's so beautiful when we talk about how we we did in the past and maybe we'll get into it a little bit and and how God refers to how strong this covenant is. I believe in Jeremiah. We'll get into that just a little bit further. But you know, we're talking about this word covenant in uh in the concordance in in it's the Hebrew 1285. It's bareth and it's from 1262 in the sense of cutting a compact because made by passing between pieces of flesh confederacy covenant league. This is the definition of this word from the Hebrew uh lexicon. And I just think it's it's wonderful to look at this because we know that there is a time further back in Genesis when God was making himself known to Abraham. He told him that if he would just simply follow him that he would actually make him a leader of a great nation. And he gave him the description of it of how they would be able to take over the land. And I'm not going to go back over it like we did so many times in the past here recently for time sake. I'm just going to try and press forward a little bit. But speaking about this covenant, Abraham fell into a dark sleep, a deep sleep. And he said, you know, he he he beheld a a smoking furnace and a and a really dark place and a a frightful scene. And we know that brother Brandham said that was actually a description of death, how humans have to die. This flesh has to perish. And I just going to put this in here today. I think it's so important for us to remember that this flesh still has to perish. This flesh will never ever inherit in corruption. &gt;&gt; This flesh will never ever see God and live &gt;&gt; ever. &gt;&gt; So, we might as well stop trying to act like this flesh should be perfect because it never will be perfect. &gt;&gt; The only thing that's perfect is God's word. And that word we have got to hide in our heart that we might not sin against him. That's the word of God. It's the only thing that will change us into a new body is his word. &gt;&gt; That's it. But I so appreciate how we can look at it and and think, you know, someday maybe if I keep in going to church and I keep reading my Bible and I keep praying that one day I'll become like an angel. I'll become an angel. You know what? We'll never be an angel. Sometimes you hear about people when they pass away that they they're now an angel, an angelic being. They are never going to be an angelic being. They are a human being. They were created in the image of God. Angels were not created in the image of God. But brothers and sisters, why not stop trying to be an angel here on this side of eternity and just live in the image of God? Maybe it's just for the kids here today, but maybe there's some big kids in our midst, is there? &gt;&gt; I know I am. The first time I heard that, I thought, man, that's a that's amazing. Why would I want to try and act like an angel because I'm not one? &gt;&gt; Why would we want to act like another creature than what we are? Let's just be humans in the image of God and recognize what redemption is. When we truly recognize the revelation of redemption, brothers and sisters, my I think there's a series right there, the revelation of redemption. All heaven's going to be quiet to hear our song special. &gt;&gt; Right? Isn't that the word of God? &gt;&gt; So, we might as well get busy practicing right here, right now. &gt;&gt; Who cares what's going on in the world? Who cares who is sitting beside us, in front of us, or behind us? We're only here for one purpose, aren't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's to worship the King of Kings. And remember, &gt;&gt; we're kings and priests according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful to think that he's the king of these kings &gt;&gt; and the Lord of Lords? My goodness. You know, I just want to welcome our friends also up in Tunnel Mountain this morning. God bless you and each one who is tuning in. Oh my. You know, we uh we picked up this this thought from Jeremiah chapter 31 the last couple of services. And just for time sake, I'm going to quickly go over it here. Jeremiah 31:33, God speaking through his prophet. But this this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel. After those days, sayaeth the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall be my people. and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother, saying, "Know the Lord." &gt;&gt; There's coming a time where we aren't going to do the same either. We're not going to go up into heaven and have prayer meetings. We're not going to go up into heaven and be preaching to the lost because we're all going to be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to be different. We're going to be in glory. But it's interesting if you look at what's going on in the world today, you can see the spirit of God lifting off of the gentile church and moving back to Israel. Why is it that the whole world now is rallying to cry out against the Jews? &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because there is an anointing that's coming on the Jews, brothers and sisters. It's this message of Jesus Christ. Verse 34 says, "And they shall teach no more, every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for they shall know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord, for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more." Now, now, let's not take this and put this off to them quite yet, because the spirit of the Lord hasn't completely lifted off of the Gentile church yet. And how do we know that? Because the rapture hasn't taken place. Once that happens, then look out. &gt;&gt; But we're not there yet. Praise the Lord. He's still calling. It's a wonderful thing to know that. But we we really kind of tried to drill down on this last time, and I think it's so important, and I just want to set the background, maybe lay a little bit of foundation here. He says that I will forgive their iniquity and will remember their sin no more. Remember that every single verse has a a compound meaning and revelation. And we know that we should see ourselves from Genesis to Revelation. We know the prophet says that we should see Jesus Christ from Genesis to Revelation. Absolutely. But guess what? I believe it goes even a little bit further. We've got to be able to see ourselves in this scripture, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; It's not just going to be for the Jews. It's going to be for the Gentiles as well. Hebrews chapter 8:10. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel. After those days, sayaeth the Lord, I will put my laws into their mind. Write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? &gt;&gt; What a tremendous blessing that is. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 10 11. And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins. God bless you brother. Safe travels. Every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftent times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins. Remember, the Jews are still living under this exact same covenant &gt;&gt; under the the blood of bulls and goats. And why is that? Not because something changed. It's because they chose to stay there. They decided to accept the law instead of grace. And why is that? That was so that we could be saved. &gt;&gt; Boy, I heard it recently this week. I I was shocked about it. Some denominational Christians were throwing off on the Jews because of what they did to Christ. They've got a an attitude problem about what the Jewish people did to Christ. Don't they know the word says they were blinded for our sake? &gt;&gt; But what it is, somebody has taught them that they're wrong. Somebody taught them that they were bad. Somebody taught them they were erroneous. And sure enough, maybe the the most religious people, we know brother Bradom preached that message and he says it very clearly there the most religious place they the most religious people crucified the greatest one. Those people they did it sure enough but we know that they were influenced by spirits and the reason they did it was so that we could actually have this grace. &gt;&gt; Outside of them doing that we would never have this grace. How could anybody ever throw off on the Jewish race? &gt;&gt; We got a prophet in our day that says they're our brothers &gt;&gt; and our sisters. &gt;&gt; And you know, just like we're elected, they are also elected. &gt;&gt; They are also elected. &gt;&gt; They're not the bride. Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that. But uh I just think, you know, this is where they live in Hebrews 10:11. And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins. It'll never change their desire. And you know brothers and sisters it's progressed so far now the building of the third temple. They actually have the red heer genetically sound in Israel and they're planning to offer one as a sacrifice according to the Levitical priesthood. It's coming up real soon. &gt;&gt; But it's not going to take away their desire. Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 12 says, "But this man, wow, one man, this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God." &gt;&gt; And we know that is resting. And not just resting, but resting in power in his position from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foottool. It doesn't matter how long it takes because the triumph has already happened. The victory is already won. He already descended down into hell, knocked on that door and said, "Open up. I'm the one." He preached to those people who were lost and said, "You know what? That one that Noah was preaching about, that one that Jeremiah was preaching about, that one that Adam spoke of, that one that all of the prophets and sages spoke about, I am him." and Satan, you have to hand over those keys of death and hell. &gt;&gt; That victory was won. So he went and sat down in his position. He took his position. For by one offering he hath what? Perfected forever them that are &gt;&gt; sanctified. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; So we're going to get into that in a little bit, but we'll just carry on here. Verse 15 says, "Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us, for after that he had said before, this is the covenant that I will make with them after those days." I just love how the word of God ties this together. As much as brother Barry wants to try and tie this covenant together with the Holy Ghost, this is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Wherefore the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's preaching to the Hebrews, but we know this is to the Gentiles also. &gt;&gt; This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, sayeth the Lord. What does he say? He says exactly what was said. He goes back to the prophet Jeremiah. And that's exactly what brother Brham did. He went right back to this as well. I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them, &gt;&gt; and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. Isn't it beautiful to think, brothers and sisters, that is our covenant right there. &gt;&gt; That's our covenant right there. That he will put his laws into our hearts and into their minds. Will I write them? That's why legalism is a waste of time. &gt;&gt; Some people might say, "Brother Barry, how could you ever say that?" You know what? He said he'll write his laws in our hearts and in our minds. So why do we need to be taught? You have to dress like this. You have to act like this. You have to do the other. How about we just get the Holy Ghost and him, the spirit of truth, when he comes, he will lead us and guide us into all truth. &gt;&gt; How about enough of of the measuring stick? Brother Brandham says enough away with the plum line of works. Let's get into grace. That grace is him writing those in our hearts, writing his laws in our hearts and and bringing it to our mind. When we do something wrong, something is going to come from our heart to our mind back up and say, "I didn't like that. You need to go make that right." &gt;&gt; We talked about it last time. And I'll tr I I I can only tell you the truth. I I don't I don't feel led to go that way today, but last time we talked about unforgiveness and and and that idea of resentment that we can hold on to things and just carry things around from people that have stepped on our toes and hurt us and it's okay. and and and it just hurts so much. And you know, Brother Barry, as you're preaching, here we go. I guess maybe you don't know how much it hurt. How hurt I am. You don't know what I went through. I don't. But he does. &gt;&gt; And by the way, do you know what he went through? &gt;&gt; We want to talk about hurt. &gt;&gt; The whole world against you. &gt;&gt; Everybody turning on you. All of your disciples, the followers just completely turning their backs on you. And one one thing will happen in our life and we'll say, "My, I'm hurt. I've got the right. I I'm entitled to carry around this hurt or this anger or this this this sadness or what whatever it is." I just think it's amazing though. This scripture here says that I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them. And when he does that, you know, brothers and sisters, we don't have to teach people that your skirt is too short, that your skirt is too tight, that that your top is too tight, that that you shouldn't look at this, that brother, you shouldn't act like that, you you shouldn't go to that other place. Why, brothers, would you want to try and talk gangster? Brothers, why would you want to go and watch this? Why would you want to do that? Why do we have to teach everyone that? Of course, we have to teach certain things in our lives, but there comes a point in time of accountability where we have to become mature sons and daughters. And when we are mature sons and daughters, then his laws are written in our hearts. &gt;&gt; He will show us that he doesn't like things. And you know what? We'll change our ways because he speaks to us and we answer. And you know, that is the truest part of the covenant, brothers and sisters. It's one thing to have someone tell you over and over, over and over, over and over, you got to do this, you got to do that, you got right to be continually taught. It's one thing to have that, but it's another thing altogether. This is where it gets shaky ground, where people get uneasy because, you know, we've got to go to the place where we know what the minister is preaching and we can say amen to it because we've had a real experience ourselves. And it's not just a 40year-old experience that happened 40 years ago somewhere. It happens every single day. He speaks to me and I respond. I speak to him and he speaks back. There's actually a relationship. And when he says, "I don't want you to do that." You don't do it. &gt;&gt; But many times we do in our flesh. &gt;&gt; Many times we do. But what happens when that happens? Is he surprised? We talked about this in the past. Sometimes we surprise ourselves. You ever surprise yourself? Maybe not. But I know I've surprised myself. I've come to the place where I can't even look at myself in the mirror. I think, who are you? Why would you do that? &gt;&gt; But I never surprised him. Not for a second. &gt;&gt; He knew that I would be that way. He knew that that's exactly the way his flesh would be. He knew that's how I would be created and all the environment around me would shape me and mold me and cause me to become this creature. But we got to become a new creature. We've got to be born again. &gt;&gt; We cannot remain the same person and say, you know, I know that it's okay. I I don't have to have an experience. I don't have to shout. I don't have to sing. I don't have to clap. Why would we not want to shout and sing and clap when we know what he's done for us? &gt;&gt; Especially when we read verse 17 here of of this this scripture that we're reading in Hebrews chapter 10. He says, "And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more." &gt;&gt; That's why I say, brothers and sisters, how dare we ever hold on to anything against anyone when he won't hold it against us? &gt;&gt; And remember, that's why he told his disciples, the way that you judge people, caution, that's the way that you're going to be judged. &gt;&gt; I just think it's so beautiful. And and you know I I'll I'll tell you as we preach those people who do minister, you know what I'm talking about. Sometimes we preach to ourselves and I'll say this is one of them. I want to say this today, brothers and sisters. I want to look at my brothers and sisters and not remember their iniquities, &gt;&gt; not remember their sins, not remember how maybe they said something behind my back and thought that the pastor never heard it. But guess what? He hears it. But I don't want to remember it because I want to say exactly what brother Brandham said. You know, I don't think they meant it. I just don't. &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful. James talks about it. You know, how you can have the the big huge ships and they have just a little tiny rudder and that'll move the ship around. Oh my, how great a fire &gt;&gt; can one of these little tongues kindle. &gt;&gt; It's not what goes into the human being. We, you know, Jesus said that, right? That what we eat doesn't defile us. It's what comes out of us that does. Yes, &gt;&gt; I just feel so so impressed about it. I can never get away from it. You know, parents, it wasn't actually the preaching of the word. It wasn't a minister that caused those 42 kids to get killed by the she bears. Was it? Brother Bradom said it was those dinnertime conversations that the parents were having amongst themselves and their children were listening. And that's why they went out and started to mock God's prophet, the man for the day. And what happened? The children died. &gt;&gt; But you know, today we don't have to worry about death naturally &gt;&gt; because we'll live. We'll thrive. Everything is good. We're living in the Leodysian church age for some people. Other people are living in the bride age. But there's always a blet of the ages and it becomes a revelation to us. But you know, we don't have to worry about our children actually being consumed by she bears. Maybe unless they go out and hang out in Tunnel Mountain without bear spray for long. But you know what we can do is worry about another thing. And that is that that devil that's going about as a roaring lion &gt;&gt; seeking whom he may devour. And who's he going to devour? He's going for the elderly and the young. He's going to go for the sick and the afflicted. He's going to go for all of the what we would call the lowhanging fruit. &gt;&gt; He's going to take the easy way because he's a coward. &gt;&gt; He knows he can't get through the strong ones. He knows he can't get through those who recognize that they're sanctified, that they're already justified, that they're already seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. So what does he do? He goes for the weaker ones. &gt;&gt; That's why, you know, he doesn't change his tactics. &gt;&gt; That's what he did. the very first thing, his very first order of business in the garden of Eden. After we talked about the iniquity after iniquity was found in his heart and he was cast down, he found himself in the garden of God. We know it was Satan, the devil. That's where he found himself. And what happened when he was there? He tried to hand that iniquity off to Eve. And what did he do? He succeeded. The only reason he succeeded is because she was not behind her husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. if she would have got behind her husband in her position and said, "I think that we should go back to my husband and have a conversation about what your proposal is here. Let's see what he has to say about things." But she took things into her own hands and tried to manage. And guess what? She was deceived. &gt;&gt; And it's beautiful because it's a type of Christ in his church. We know it had to happen. The fall had to happen so he could express his attributes to us and through us. A true husband isn't just going to let his wife fall, let her go. No way. Adam wasn't in the transgression. That's what the word of God says. Adam knew she was a part of him. And he was not about to let her go. Not for a second. &gt;&gt; But I think this scripture is so beautiful here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. I I say, Lord, help me live my life where I look at my brothers and my sisters through those eyes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let those eyes be the ones that look out and around in this world. I I believe we would have a different world if we could do that ourselves. Recognize that he's not recognizing our sins and iniquities. So, how could we recognize theirs? &gt;&gt; We know that Jesus disciples asked him, you know, how many times should I forgive my brother who just continually steps on my toe, continually sins against me? What did Jesus say? 70 times. Seven times. &gt;&gt; Not just seven times. According to the Old Testament law. No, no. According to the magnified law that I bring in my flesh, 70* 7. Because the way that you judge is how you're going to be judged. We need to make sure that we're looking through these eyes. We know probably preaching to the choir here, but true prophets, they only say what has been said. They don't bring a new message. They only point back to the original message. And on Wednesday, we had such a tremendous service. If anybody is interested, I highly recommend streaming it. Listen to it. It's on YouTube. I'm not trying to promote YouTube. And us, it's Brother Timothy Ashang from Ghana. He's a general in this word. He's been preaching this gospel for 40 years. And he just simply said, "Listen, shake yourself. Check up your experience and make sure that it still fits the original pattern. And if it doesn't, why doesn't it? &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful. I want to shake myself. The way that he preached that was so glorious. Let me shake myself and check myself." This isn't a time to be playing church and thinking that everything is okay. We can just make excuses and do what we want. This is no time for playing. One of these days there's going to be two witnesses in Israel. &gt;&gt; And when those witnesses are in Israel, the bride's already gone. So if we witness those Israel witnesses, it's too late. &gt;&gt; The only way that we're going to make it is to give our lives. &gt;&gt; But we don't have to do that. I think it's so amazing how we're here today and he's not remembering our sins and iniquities no more. They're in the sea of his forgetfulness. And this is what we really talked about last time. When we have something in our heart, we got something that just we can't get rid of. Let's just take it and give it to God so that he can put it in the sea of his forgetfulness. We'll never be able to forget, but we can actually choose to dig up those memories. And we can choose to entertain them. And we can choose to open up the volumes and go through line by line. They said this, they did this, they went there, did that. Blah blah blah blah. Or we can close the book and throw it into the sea of God's forgetfulness and say, "Nope, that's my brother or my sister, and I don't remember their sin or their iniquity anymore, just like he doesn't remember my sin or my iniquity anymore." We have a choice. We can choose, brothers and sisters. True prophets only say what's been said. Paul preached what Jeremiah preached and brother Brham, he preached what Paul preached. So setting that as a background, I just would like to move forward out of Hebrews 10. I'd like to just go a little bit further if we can. Let's jump down to verse 18 in Hebrews chapter 10. We know that they lived under the old old law. The Jews lived under the Old Testament covenant where there was there was sacrifices that were made continually every year and they can do everything exactly right according to the law and and when they did it was it was accepted. Their sacrifice was accepted but it didn't change their behavior. It didn't change their desire. They still desired to sin. But in Hebrews 10 verse 18 and we know that this is the transition. This is the changing of the dispensation going from the Jews to the Gentiles. Verse 18 says, "Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering of sin. This is what happened at Calvary, the cross between the Jews and the Gentiles." Verse 19 says, "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus." This is such a foreign word to those people who were on the ground in the day. Remember, they had the Levitical priesthood, the Old Testament law, they had the temple. A and can you imagine what happened? Many times I think we we we preach about how when Jesus his very first order of business God in flesh when his flesh was torn when he bowed his head and said it's finished and we know the word says that he gave up the ghost when that ghost would was given up what did it do it didn't shoot up into heaven it shot into the temple and it tore that veil &gt;&gt; from the top to the bottom &gt;&gt; to make an example that there's no more veil between God and man &gt;&gt; there's No more cherubams guarding that tree of life. &gt;&gt; I think it's amazing that that was his first order of business. I've preached that many times. But I just can't help but think, you know, the the religiosity of man, what would they have done in that day? You can only imagine because they didn't believe Jesus at all. So much so they actually said to the disciples, you better to the guards, I mean, you better shut your mouths about him actually coming out of the grave and we're going to pay you large is what the word says that you will shut your mouth and if you do say anything to anyone, we're going to actually hold you accountable for letting him escape. They didn't want to accept Jesus at all in any way. &gt;&gt; So what did they do? You can only imagine. They got everyone together and they got out the needles and the thread and they mended that curtain, that veil, put it right back to its religious beauty. And let's not do that today, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; I think it can be so easy to to want to actually stitch that veil up and and create a holy place that maybe only a few people can get through. Maybe a a a great ministry or or maybe an evangelist or or maybe just the parents or or maybe just a husband or maybe just a wife. No, no, that veil was torn. The word of God says that was the first thing that he did. Let's keep it torn. Let's recognize that now it is actually death to stay outside of that holy place. &gt;&gt; But talking about this verse here in in Hebrews 19 here now, uh I believe this is Hebrews 10:1 19. Having therefore, brethren, boldness, enter in to the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way. Back in that day, this was completely foreign to them. They were used to the religiosity, the the most religious people, the the the animal sacrifice, the blood of bulls and goats, the old covenant. They were used to that. And they even called themselves the seed of Abraham, didn't they? They said, "We have Abraham as our father, and and you say that in three days you're going to raise this temple back up." not recognizing who he truly was. And he wasn't talking about the stones. He was talking about this temple in three days. Indeed, he will raise it back up again. But because of that, now he's saying, Paul is saying to the Hebrews, he's saying to the Gentiles, he's saying to everyone, having, brethren, boldness, enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus. recognize now by the blood of this one sacrifice, we can go in to the holy place by a new and living way, not an old dead way. Not because an animal was killed and our desires haven't changed. When we accept this one sacrifice that was offered on our behalf, it changes our ways. &gt;&gt; It changes our desires. &gt;&gt; That's the difference between the old covenant and the new covenant. Having therefore, brethren, boldness, enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus. What is the holiest that we can enter into, brothers and sisters? Some people might say, well, it's it's a church building. Maybe it's Calgary Living Word Assembly. And others here maybe from Saskatoon would say, "No, no, it's Saskatoon Tabernacle." And others here might say, "No, no, no. It's Ed end time message tabernacle." And and there could be all manner of different descriptions of what that holy place could be. But we know we had a prophet, a vindicated prophet, one that had a ministry that showed around the world seven times that God is with him. He said the only place that God has chosen to put his name is in Jesus Christ. The only place that God has chosen for us to worship is in Jesus Christ. How do we get into Jesus Christ today, brothers and sisters? It's by a new and living way and that is by getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He is the one that gives witness that we have actually entered into that place. Anything else is false. We know brother Bradom said it that all else is false. &gt;&gt; Mark 16 in action. The Holy Ghost, the acts of the Holy Ghost working in and through the body is the only church that he calls his own in the day in which we live. All else is false. And we know there's a lot of false in this world in which we live in. My goodness. But you know, we have been given a boldness &gt;&gt; because we understand this that there is a new covenant. Verse 20 says, "By a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us." This is where I think it's so beautiful when we talk to the legalists and we try to consecrate. We do want to consecrate, but we can only consecrate so far because he's done it all. The only thing we can do is surrender to his consecration &gt;&gt; and say, "Be it unto me according to thy word, Lord." That's all. Come and and and fill me. Come by my way. Here's my cup, Lord. I lift it up. &gt;&gt; Maybe I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost once upon a time, but I just need a little more oil today. That's why we come to church, brothers and sisters. Not just to hear some good preaching, not just to hear some good anointed preaching. Even though we do, I trust that we come to church so that we can top up our experience of the Holy Ghost in our life. We all need to have that oil. We know that the shout has already gone forward. &gt;&gt; The shout, the voice, the trumpet, the rapture being an experience. That shout has already taken place. And now there's a voice. Where's that voice? Some people would say in Jeffersonville, Indiana. Some people would say just in the vindicated prophets. Some people would say only in the ministry. I'll tell you the voice is inside the bride of Jesus Christ. The ones who have that new and living way inside of them. The true baptism of the Holy Ghost is that voice. And that voice is going to be just like Lazarus coming forth from the grave. There was one man that some people want to argue that he was man. And some people want to say that he is God. He was all God. an all man is what the prophet said in our day. And he was all man when he cried for his friend that died. But he was all God when he put his shoulders back and stood at that tomb and said, "Lazarus, come forth." It's going to be the same voice that was in that man that is in the bride of Jesus Christ that actually brings the trump of God. And it's not going to be a moment sooner or a moment later than what God has for ordained before the foundation of the world. It's just up to her to be in step with his word. We know the prophet of God gave that vision of the bride, right? The true bride, the church was given two previews. The first one, she was all over the place. And we know there was a bunch in the middle of impostors, impersonators, and it grossed the prophet out. He was so sad and sick to say that is this really what all of this preaching has come to, Lord? And he said, you know, there was one more vision and it was the bride &gt;&gt; marching to onward Christian soldiers, right? But he said, even that preview, there was still a couple getting out of step. And what did he come out of that vision? Screaming, "Stay in line. &gt;&gt; Check the pattern. &gt;&gt; Shake yourself. Make sure that we fit the pattern." &gt;&gt; We don't want to check and make sure the pattern fits us. And I think many times that's the problem in the Christian experience. we could just go church shopping. I could just find a church that'll just fit my pattern and and you know it'll be okay. Sure enough, they'll tell you it'll be just fine. But I think it's wonderful if you've heard that God sent a prophet. What did the prophet say? I think it's wow. It's so inspiring to think that we can change ourselves. Better yet, he can change us. He has to change us, brothers and sisters, to fit that pattern. We know we're hearing that on Wednesday night. I don't know if anybody else kind of went there in their own mind, but thinking about it, when we go and get on an airline, if you're going to carry on a bag, everybody here has flown, I'm sure you know that your bag has to fit that little rack. And if it doesn't fit that little rack, why would you try and carry it on? Even though there's still people that try and do it, and it causes delays and problems and upsets and so on and so forth, but they've got a pattern, don't they? It's got to fit that that rack. And if it doesn't fit, it doesn't fly. &gt;&gt; I just can't help but think the same thing for us, brothers and sisters. They don't take that rack and make it fit our bag. Even though sometimes we would like it if they could, but they never will. But we've been given the ability in the day in which we live to have boldness to enter into the holiest. Not by our blood, not by any other sacrifice, but by the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how we get in there. It's by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us. He did it, brothers and sisters, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh. Don't stumble at the veil. We know the word of God says to know no man after the flesh. Just just look at that man and say that's an attribute of God there. &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful to think that brother Brandham said it that you don't see the real me? I I'm so glad that you don't see the real me. &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to say I'm so glad that I don't see the real you because that could be taken wrong. But you know, brothers and sisters, we don't see each other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't see the true real us the way that he created us. But it's beautiful because that's the only way he sees us. He doesn't see us the way we see ourselves. &gt;&gt; And that's the trick the devil has. That's the trick that he does. He tries to say that he sees you. Brother Bradam said it that he doesn't see you. He only hears you. He sees your theophony body the way that he created us before the foundation of the world. My by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh. and having an high priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. And what is that water, brothers and sisters? The water of the word. &gt;&gt; Let that word wash over us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let that word change us. When it does, we can draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith. Alls we have to do is die out to oursel daily. I think that's the critical key. That's all we have to do is die daily. Recognize there. We cannot walk in this world without this flesh stumbling us without this flesh tripping us up. But it doesn't matter whether it stumbles or triple trips this flesh up. It will never stumble or trip our soul. If we ever truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost, we will never be able to walk away from this word. Why is that? Because we will never grieve the Holy Spirit to the place where we are not sealed till the day of our redemption. We will be sealed until the day of our redemption. We know many different religious organizations around the world teach that that you know you can be saved today, but if you sin, then you'll have to come and repent tomorrow because you'll be lost. No, no, no. You won't be lost. If you get saved today, you are saved until the day of your redemption, until you cross over. And you know, alls we do is we recognize that we sin. We recognize that we fall. And we recognize that there's only one way that we can make sure that we can draw near with a true heart with full assurance. That's recognizing that we've been washed by the water of the word, that it's his blood that sanctifies us. Verse 23 says, "Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering. Isn't that beautiful? Let us do it, brothers and sisters. And I know we do, but I just hope that maybe we can just encourage one another today with these words. We know that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, right? &gt;&gt; But what did he do? He was strong in faith, giving glory to God. He was willing to praise the Lord even when he didn't feel like it. Even when he did stumble, he did stagger at the word. He was a backslider. Remember when he went down into Egypt? Remember that? And he said, "You know what, Sarah, my beautiful wife, now that you've had a body change, you you got to tell them that you're my sister, because if you tell them, if if if we say that you're my wife, they're going to kill me because you're so beautiful, they're going to want to take you and make you one of theirs." This is God's prophet. Even though he did that, the word of God says that he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief. I think it's beautiful because when uh she went down there, when he went down there, Brother Brandham brings that out. I don't think anybody else ever preached this, but they had a body change, didn't they? &gt;&gt; Someone met them on the plains of memory. And he identified who it was. &gt;&gt; He said it was God, Elohim. &gt;&gt; And we know that his nephew, he couldn't recognize it. He said two lords, two Lord doctrine started way back there. But we had this one who visited them, told them that I'm going to visit you according to the time of I promised you that you were going to have a promised seat. He had already tried to make it happen by getting with Hagar and and having Ishmamail and all of that. But here we have him actually going down the road with this one and and he met him and changed his body and changed her body. And this is so beautiful for me. I didn't understand this until I heard brother Brandham say it. Why would a king of another land desire Sarah, his wife, an old grandma? No offense to the grandmas here. &gt;&gt; But why would he? It's because her body was changed back. She was a young girl again. &gt;&gt; How did she give birth from her womb? It's because she had a body change. &gt;&gt; How do we give birth in our womb, brothers and sisters? We have a body change. We become a new creature in Christ Jesus. There's a new birth that takes place. It's not about saying that I just I I'll accept whatever the church believes and put my name on the page and call her good and go home. Bless God, I'm saved. We know that there's millions and billions of those impersonators in this world. But there's a few people that are actually willing to go all the way to a body change. Not not necessarily over there, but right here. How does the body change happen? I'll tell you how it happens. We get a new character inside of us. When the new birth happens in our life, this body no longer desires to do the things that it once did. &gt;&gt; Our desires completely change. It becomes a new creature in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Verse 22 says, "Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience." We don't have to come to church thinking that I'm an evil man. We don't have to live in the world thinking that I'm an evil person and I just need to do some sort of pentance pentance to to make it better. I I need to continually stagger at the promise because I just don't see it in my flesh. As long as we do that, we will never see it. But when we look away to Jesus, &gt;&gt; when we stop looking at the problems in our lives, &gt;&gt; when we stop looking at the waves and the sea, remember the disciples were in the boat and the sea was contrary and and and Jesus drew near. And and they thought, "Oh, it's a spirit. Oh no, look." But then they recognized him. Peter said, "If it's you, Lord, bid me to come." And what did Jesus say? "Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on." &gt;&gt; And what did he do? He stepped out of the boat. The word of God says that he stepped down out of the boat and he began to step on the water. Peter even walked on water. &gt;&gt; But what did he do? Instead of looking at Jesus, he started to look at the sea. &gt;&gt; As soon as he started to look at the circumstances, down he went. &gt;&gt; And what did Jesus do? He didn't let him fall. He grabbed him and said, "Oh man, ye of little faith. Goodness, I say, Lord, increase our faith. Help us to look away to Jesus today and not look at the circumstances or situations. And and I take that to my own heart and soul, brothers and sisters. My Let's hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering. Let's hold on to that and stagger. Not at the promise of God through unbelief. We're going to stagger, but not at the promise of God through unbelief. What is unbelief? Unbelief is sin. Unbelief is what's going to take us away. If we've truly been baptized with the Holy Ghost, there's no unbelief that can take root in our lives. &gt;&gt; Verse 24, I think it's so beautiful. And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works. What a tremendous scripture. I I think it speaks for itself. Are we doing that? Are we applying that in our lives? Verse 25, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is. Let's not forget this middle part in here, but exhorting one another. Many times that's left out and it's just, you know, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together. Even more so as you see the day approaching. What it is is a legalistic interpretation of this scripture. There's people that don't have the revelation yet of what it means to come to church to get your oil topped up. It's not coming to church so that I can actually just say I'm a good church member. What we do is we come to church so that we can get our oil topped up. And sometimes, brothers and sisters, when we come to church, we've said it before in the past, it's not even for ourselves. We come to church so that we can be an encouragement to the brothers and sisters who are really going through a struggle. &gt;&gt; And they look around and see, wow, there's more people that are struggling, too. There's more people that believe this thing that is is compelling me to come to church. &gt;&gt; Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another. Didn't that just say that there? Let's consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works. My isn't it interesting how this scripture here could just be taken and spun in just a little tiny bit. Leave out just one or two word. We know that's what Satan does, isn't it? &gt;&gt; We don't want to take this and apply it the way that it's not intended. We want to take the whole word of God because that's what's going to change our bodies. Verse 26 says, "For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remainth no more sacrifice for sins." And we can go back to Hebrews 6 and know that Brother Brandham preaches on that. He talks about the the sewer of the seed. We know the the man in white going around the earth that's dissed up and he's throwing his seed out. And right after that, he goes around the curvature of the earth. There's another one that's sinister man coming in black and he's sewing seeds as well as he goes around behind the one in the white and and brother Bradam talks about it. Those people who are once enlightened and have tasted of this heavenly gift it's impossible for them to come back and renew themselves. Once we have truly tasted of this heavenly gift, brothers and sisters, there ain't no going back. &gt;&gt; We sing that song, I'm going home because we know that's where we're going. And it doesn't matter what comes our way. Whether it's life or whether it's death, it doesn't matter. We recognize that death is simply a buggy that is hooked up to take us from the presence of this world into the presence of God. Because we know as believers to be absent in the body is to be present with the Lord. &gt;&gt; What a tremendous blessing that is. &gt;&gt; But if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remainth no more sacrifice for sins. That's why I think it's so treacherous when we look at the the word of God and the message of the hour from a a legalistic perspective. We we actually I believe we actually skirt with this scripture here. Because what's happening is we're judging others. The word of God says to judge not lest ye be judged also. Look away to Jesus. That's all we got to do is look away to Jesus. get the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and we'll have grace because that's what saves us. It's grace. It's the grace of God. And and the only reason we are able to know that God sent a prophet. The only reason we're able to receive this message of the hour is because of his grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not because our parents taught it to us, even though it is. It's not because we stumbled into a mission on the corner, even though it is. &gt;&gt; It's neither one of those. Brother Brandham talks about it. We're going to get into it with the last few minutes we've got here. I think it's so beautiful. But if we willfully sin after we've received the knowledge of the truth, what is the knowledge of the truth in a day in which we live? It's grace. &gt;&gt; It's the grace of God. &gt;&gt; It's not legalism. It's not my I've done this so I'm entitled or or or I've done that or I tithe or I I come to church and I do this in service and whatever whatever. None of that. It's a stench in the nostril of God's nose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we don't have grace, if we have grace, &gt;&gt; then I believe he receives it as a sweet sacrifice. &gt;&gt; But you know, brothers and sisters, there is an absolute and that's the word of God. And and that word is first &gt;&gt; and above all else. &gt;&gt; The word first above all else. You know, I sent the brothers some quotes here that I wanted to bring up, and I I just got them backwards today. So, we'll start with number three. I numbered them out of why we are not a denomination in 1958 0927. The message I believe Brother Brandham preaches for the most part in in almost every single sermon that he preaches, just about the entirety of the message, if you really listen, it's so beautiful the way he brings it. But in in this message, he says this here. He says, "Now look way back way back before this world started in them Adam's back yonder when God seen what was going to take place right there, he saw you." &gt;&gt; This this this message, this kind of talking, this kind of description takes the word of God to a whole new level. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Way back before this world started in them, Adam's back yonder, when God seen what was going to take place right there, he saw you. &gt;&gt; He saw me. &gt;&gt; He saw every flea, every fly, every frog, every gnat. I I think about this myself and I think really that mosquito that I saw this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; All of them. All of them. He's God. &gt;&gt; His ways are are beyond our comprehension. &gt;&gt; But he saw us. &gt;&gt; He saw us before there was even a speck of stardust. He says in another place in the message everything would ever be on earth. He saw it right then. Sure he did. He says now he never said I'll send my son down and let him die and maybe somebody will have pity on him and it'll be such a pitiful case perhaps maybe somebody might get saved. We were having a conversation about funerals and uh you know it's interesting because I had heard it said before. I I I was shocked to hear it even that it's a thing, but actually it's a real thing that you know, you can have a funeral and you can actually have paid mourers that will attend the funeral. I was talking to brother Timothy about it actually and uh he said, you know, sometimes they won't even know whether it's a man or a woman. They'll be mourning and then someone will say, did you know them? And and and and they'll say, you know, they'll just start crying again because they don't know whether it's a man or a woman. There's no description other than they're there to mourn. But isn't it an interesting thing, brothers and sisters, that that this is not the way it is with Jesus. &gt;&gt; This is not the way it is because Jesus was God coming down in flesh to express himself to this world and more than anything to be the perfect sacrifice to redeem his brethren as a kinsman redeemer. The only way that he could do it himself. But I just love how he says this here. Now, he never said, "I'll send my son and let him die, and maybe somebody will have pity on him, and it'll be such a pitiful case. Perhaps somebody might get saved." Why not? He forneew who would be saved. &gt;&gt; And this gets some people uncomfortable. I I I I pray that it won't hear today. To be fornown is actually a beautiful thing. &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing. And that's really the only thing for a believer. In fact, we're not a believer if we're not fornown. That's the way it is. He forneew who would be saved. Yes, sir. Oh my, this is hard. He said, "Esau I hate and Jacob I love." And we know the word of God says, "Neither one of them having either one doing good or evil yet." &gt;&gt; That's what the word of God says. Neither one even had a chance to express themselves. But that's the way he saw them &gt;&gt; before either one ever had a chance to prove what they was because he knowed what they was. He knew. He knows everything. He knew what you would do before you were born or when the world began. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I want to say this, brothers and sisters. When we fall down, remember, we're surprised, but he ain't. &gt;&gt; He is never surprised. &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what we'll do about it. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we'll fall down and it'll go for days where we just know what we need to do, but this thing inside of us just wants to hold on. Remember, it's an evil spirit. The longer you hold on to it, the more you're entertaining the devil. &gt;&gt; Tell the devil to beat it. Tell him &gt;&gt; that you rebuke him in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; You don't have to scream and shout. You don't have to have a prayer meeting. You don't even need to come to the front of the church. You could just say it yourself. &gt;&gt; And remember, that's the bride's commission is to speak the word, the spoken word condition. &gt;&gt; That's the world in which we live in. The whole world is tapping into that through AI technology and so on and so forth. But here we have the bride of Jesus Christ. She has been given up to half of the kingdom. She's been given the king's ring. And the king said, "I'm not going to speak. You speak." &gt;&gt; Hmon wants to put you on the gallows. &gt;&gt; We can't rewrite the law. But you can say something. &gt;&gt; You can say something about it. &gt;&gt; The devil wants to take us and put us on the gallows. He wants to try and make us all upset and think that I I I just can't do it. You're 100% right if you think you can't do it because you never can. The only way we have success is because he lives in us. &gt;&gt; We sing that song. Because he lives. &gt;&gt; I can face tomorrow. Where does he live, brothers and sisters? &gt;&gt; We're not looking to heaven. &gt;&gt; We don't need him in heaven. Even though we're going to be with him in heaven, we need him right here. &gt;&gt; Where does he live? He lives in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Now remember, the devil, he can't create. He can only pervert. &gt;&gt; The only thing that he can do is pervert. And that's exactly what he did at the very beginning was he perverted the word of God in the garden of God. He said one word off. And what did that do? That unleashed Satan's kingdom. It changed the world forever. &gt;&gt; But the devil can't create. And as I was preparing these notes, I I had a a thought and I just I'm so glad when the Lord inspires us. I I think it's important to say this, too. The devil can't read our thoughts. &gt;&gt; For the longest time, I thought he could because suddenly there would be this temptation that maybe I'm thinking about. But you know what that is? That's the devil trying to put his thoughts in our mind. &gt;&gt; Those aren't our thoughts. &gt;&gt; But he's going to say, "Oh, I know what you were thinking." No, you don't know what I was thinking. &gt;&gt; Because if you did, you wouldn't have been putting that thought there in my mind. &gt;&gt; But here's the thing. When those thoughts come, do we act on them? Because if we act on them, then what we do is we show him that we actually receive them. &gt;&gt; Then we receive those thoughts. And the more we receive those thoughts, the more he's going to pour them out. He's going to call us boys and say, "Look, look, look, we're getting success with this over here. Let's bolster this. Call in the the reinforcements. We got to make sure we're getting through to this believer &gt;&gt; because we want to trick him. We know he's a believer, but we want to trick him into thinking that he's not a believer. &gt;&gt; And that's the way he works. He can't create. He can't read our minds. &gt;&gt; The only thing he can do is take and twist the word of God, try and pervert it in our minds, try and make us think that there's some holy act that we can do to make ourselves good Christian people. The only thing that we can do is die to ourselves. and give him the full preeminence that he desires in our life. &gt;&gt; But he's going to take and twist the word. And you know, it's the reason why so many people are tossed about. &gt;&gt; So many people are tossed about. It's the reason why so many Christians find it hard to live the Christian life &gt;&gt; because they're busy trying to do it themselves. They're not giving him the preeminence that he desires. &gt;&gt; And and how does that work, brothers and sisters? I'll tell you how it works. It's not easy. But it's why some people cannot keep the victory. &gt;&gt; And if you're wondering, these are all messages that Brother Brandham preached. &gt;&gt; Why some people cannot keep the victory. Why so many Christians find it hard to live the Christian life. why so many people are tossed about. You have to go and listen to them and see what Brother Brandham has to say about it. But I'll just try and put it in a nutshell here for us. It's because people are not dying out to themselves entirely. &gt;&gt; They're still holding on to some tradition. &gt;&gt; Back there where we had that church, that time that that day in which we lived, we did it this way. Or or or maybe even my parents taught it that way. You know what? If either one of those don't line up with this word for our day, let it go. &gt;&gt; Because as long as we hold on to those things, we're not allowing him to actually hold us. &gt;&gt; We're busy holding on to the thing that we think is right. But what happens is it makes it impossible for a Christian to live the life. And I think it's beautiful because of the way God has it set up. It is impossible for us to live it. It has to be him. That's the only way that we will ever be able to measure up with this word is for him to live it through us. &gt;&gt; But what happens is the devil comes and gives some kind of perverted version of the word. And I'm not talking about a sexual perversion. I'm talking about just simply twisting one word, getting one word off. We know that he did it with Eve. Thou shalt not surely die. &gt;&gt; But that one word put the whole human race into chaos. Brothers and sisters, don't allow a perverted teaching of the word of God throw us off. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We just have to die to our thinkings, to our traditions. Even unfortunately, I think it's so true. We have to die to our religion. &gt;&gt; We've got to die to our religion. Sometimes we have a religion. Even in the message, we'll say, "I I I'm a message believer, but I say this, that's nice. Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe? &gt;&gt; Is that what's happened? Or have we just received the message? Have we just got the head knowledge that God sent a prophet and and we know all about the quotes and we know all about the books and the tapes and the history and all the different people that had time spent with the prophet of God. That ain't going to save us because he never died for our sins. That's right. &gt;&gt; He brought us a message and that message was get into Christ. &gt;&gt; Better yet, get Christ into you. &gt;&gt; And I I just love that message that we heard on Wednesday. Let's check our experience. Let's check up and make sure that we fit the pattern. We've been given the pattern. Let's shake ourselves. Let's die out to all those things and allow the peace of God to prevail in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when we stop trying to do it ourselves and he does it, then we get a peace that passes all understanding. &gt;&gt; It goes beyond our comprehension. It goes way beyond anything we could ever imagine. People that once knew us will say, "Who are you and what have you done with my brother or my sister? Why are you such a different thing?" You can tell them, "Because I am a new creature in Christ Jesus." Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful. We just need to allow the perfect peace of God to prevail in our lives when he, the spirit of truth, comes into our life, brothers and sisters. He, the personal pronoun, &gt;&gt; so beautiful how the prophet back in the day was already using that lingo. Isn't it good? What's your pronoun? I think about it today. If somebody ever asked me that question, I'm going to tell them I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am. Because it's not me you're talking to. &gt;&gt; It's the Christ that lives inside of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the one that's right here. &gt;&gt; But he, the personal pronoun, the spirit of truth, he will lead us and guide us into all truth. Our wisdom and understanding will lead us astray, brothers and sisters. We'll make a wrong turn. We'll go off the edge. We'll hit a guardrail and spin out. There's no way that we'll be able to manage on our own &gt;&gt; out of why are we not a denomination? This is number two. Says, see where the Jehovah Witnesses would be so far wrong there to think that the new birth is the resurrection of the body. You see, it couldn't be. It's got to be something. And he he doesn't say exactly what it is there. I think it's so beautiful because he does go on to say a little more here. He says you you're in a time space and the only thing that's eternal is something that had no beginning or no end. &gt;&gt; So even talking about the eternal is something that we just have as a a a concept that we try to talk about and and explain. But unless we actually can be eternal, we can't really understand this on our own in in a human sense. with a faith sense we can. Faith is the substance. &gt;&gt; It's the evidence. Oh my. I don't want to go too far. He says you're in a time space and you're and the only thing that's eternal is something that had no beginning or no end. Anything eternal never had a beginning or it never will have an end. See, so if you're a part of God, &gt;&gt; the spirit that's in you never had a beginning or it never will have an end. And you're eternal with the spirit that's in you. See, isn't that beautiful? It's like we just are able to become to know ourselves. We get introduced to ourselves when we hear a teaching like this to think that I I'm not even my own. I I'm I don't even know who I am. But we have a description of the character of ourselves when we look at ourselves like this by the character and description of Jesus Christ. He says like the agapo love when it comes down to the felio love and then down to lust love the digression of this life. It just keeps going on down and on down, perverting on down till it's become just a conglomeration to one mess. And you know, we don't have to look very far and we can say that's exactly where we are today. We were in B on Friday and I had to apologize to my son sitting in the front of of the vehicle as we watched I'll say a human being walk in front of the vehicle. Right? He was there. He saw it. I I had to apologize that this is the condition of life that we live in. This is how far down it's digressed. It's gone down that ladder. It's beyond just human lust. It's it's it's crazy is what it is naturally speaking. But it has to be that way in the day in which we live. &gt;&gt; But he says this like like the agapo love when it comes down to filio love. Agapo love is the love of Christ when it comes down to from the Christ to human love and and and that's the filio love and then it goes down to lust love and it gets down to I'll say maybe an animal thing and and it just keeps going down and down perverting until it's become just a conglomeration to one mess and I can't help but think that's where we live today brothers and sisters exactly that description &gt;&gt; in that mess &gt;&gt; well the only way Jesus came down that same ladder down here to pick up and take back up to the highest form, from the lowest form, from death unto life, &gt;&gt; from sickness unto health, &gt;&gt; from unrighteousness to righteousness. See, &gt;&gt; the perversion to the perfect. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; First, it went from the perfect to the perversion. But he came down himself. He didn't send another angel, did he? He came himself to take it and bring it back to where it's supposed to be to its original estate. And we know in 1963 something happened. It wasn't God's prophet that happened. &gt;&gt; He came himself to actually take it back to that perfection. &gt;&gt; He come from the highest to the lowest that he might bring the lowest to the highest. He become me that I might through his what? his grace become him an heir of the throne in glory. See what I mean? These things. Oh my, I think this is just so beautiful. You know, in the book of Acts talking about the promise, Acts 2:38 and 39. We know that's some of the most famous scriptures that we talk about. We know that that this is the the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. But I want to talk about verse 39 here in Acts chapter 2. It says, "For the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are a far off, even as many as not some ministry will call." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even as many as the Lord our God shall call. Why would he call them? Because they were fornown in him. &gt;&gt; My goodness. Let's turn over to Romans chapter 8. Now, I want to preach Romans chapter 8. I think it's absolutely beautiful. This is really where we live, brothers and sisters. I I hope it's where we live because it's the story of our lives when we can see that this is the word for our day. Some people are stuck in Romans chapter 7. And I know that and I live there myself, but I just say it over and over again. You know, there's there's there's going to be emnity between this flesh and the spirit. That's the way it is. This flesh is against the spirit. The spirit is against the flesh. It will be that way until our bodies change. But we can continually feed upon this word to the place where this flesh has very little strength. Not our spirit, but our our our flesh can have very little power over the creature. But just for the sake of time, I want to say this. Maybe if you want to see where I'm coming from, just go home and read Romans chapter 8. We we look at Romans chapter 7. It says, "Oh Lord, who can deliver me from this vile body?" We know I'm just paraphrasing there, but in verse one, it says of chapter 8, there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. That's why I say, brothers and sisters, let's not look around at brothers and sisters. Let's look away to Jesus. Let's look away to the word of God. Because if we're following the word of God, we're not going to be looking at our brothers and sisters according to their natural lives. But in Romans 8 verse 28, brother Brandham in this message, why are we not a denomination? He takes this scripture here. It's just so beautiful. Verse 28, he says, "And we know that all things work together for the good." &gt;&gt; Now, we need to make sure that we remember there's more to this scripture. All things work together for the good. Not just period, but to those who those who love God. to them who are the called according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not everyone is called according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; So all things don't always work together for the good. But if we're called according to his purpose, if we're given a trial, we know that he's working out that character, that gold that he counseledled us to buy of him that's tried in the fire of fiery afflictions. Woo. It's terrible when we look at it as a human, but it's glorious when we look at it as a believer. We know that all things work together for good to them that are called, them, sorry, them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, &gt;&gt; not to the image of a church. And I'll say this, not even to the image of a prophet, &gt;&gt; the image of his son. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called. Whom he called, them he also justified, and whom he also justified them, he also glorified. &gt;&gt; Now, don't get me wrong. I ain't throwing off on brother Brandham, &gt;&gt; but I know if I I if he was sitting here right today, he'd be saying, "Amen. Look away to Jesus. Don't look at me. He even said it when he was here in his flesh. I must decrease so that he must increase. And you know, brothers and sisters, spirits don't die. There's spirits alive today where people still follow John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; Some people want to follow Eleazar. &gt;&gt; Others want to follow Christ. &gt;&gt; If we truly follow the teachings of William, Miriam, Brandham, he said, "Follow Christ." &gt;&gt; Behold the bridegroom. It's beautiful. &gt;&gt; But you know brothers and sisters, verse 31 says, "What shall we say? What shall we then say to these things? Oh my, if God be for us, who can be against us? &gt;&gt; What can be against us? If God is for us, brothers and sisters, if we already have the fornowledge to know that he has called us unto adoption, who could be against us? It doesn't matter what comes our way. It doesn't matter what devil starts boasting down in the valley. We know that we can pick up a stone and go down there and kill him. &gt;&gt; He's a squatter. He's got no rights. &gt;&gt; Out of why we are not a denomination. This is quote number one. Brother Brandham, he says, "Now, how what kind of people ought we to be?" Notice how these things take place. Now, those who he forneew, he called. Those who he called, he justified those when Was it when we went to church the first time? The first time our parents taught us. First time we picked up a Bible? No. When was it? When was it? Now, those who he forneew, he called, those who he called, he justified those when before the foundation of the world. Before the world ever began, he says, "Now, if we could take this scripture and really justify it, we'd take hours on it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we don't want to do that. But all this unrighteousness here is righteousness perverted. Isn't that interesting to think about? &gt;&gt; This world that we live in, brothers and sisters, he says that's what the devil does. Now, when you come to the age of accountability and you know what's right and wrong and right, you're supposed to turn from your wrong because you're born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come to the world speaking lies, then you're actually born as a sexual desire, and then you must be born again &gt;&gt; as a human being. We don't have a choice. The way we come into this world, &gt;&gt; we're born in sin, shaped iniquity. We come into this world speaking lies. Period. &gt;&gt; Nothing we can do about that. We need to come to the place where we're able to say amen to that. And that's the first step. When we can recognize that, then we can realize we need to be born again. &gt;&gt; That's what being born again is, is having a new spirit placed within us. But not just a new spirit. Because we know, brother Bradom said, you could be mistaken. Because before his holy spirit comes, you get a new spirit. Why do you get a new spirit? Because your spirit can't even get along with your own spirit. We can't even get along with ourselves many times. That's why we need a new spirit to be able to behold the lamb of God when he comes into our life as the Holy Ghost. But he says in order to receive a new birth to enter into heaven because this kind of a birth you have here. It's the way that we're born here. But I love this scripture in Romans chapter 8:31. What shall we say then to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, brothers and sisters, two halves make the whole. And we know the very beginning of all this teaching about the covenant was about how how Abraham he he was given the instruction. God said to him, I want you to lay out the sacrifice in array. And when you do, everything is going to be in place. I'm going to come down and visit you upon it. And we know that he he had to wait. We talked about it how the devils came around the birds and tried to mess with his sacrifice and what he shued them away. He had to wait upon the Lord. Those who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. But with all of this, there came a time where there was a lamp that came down and investigated all of that sacrifice that came between the two halves. And I can't help but think today, there is a pillar of fire. The exact same pattern that comes down and gets right between the two halves, between the soul and the spirit. The word of God is quicker and more powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, and it gets right in between all of the joints in the marrow, even to the discerning of the hearts of men. He knows our thoughts. Right now, our thoughts are louder in heaven than voices that we could actually throw here on earth. &gt;&gt; But you know, the two halves always make the hole. There has to come a time where we can see and say that this covenant is not for some people in a foreign land somewhere else. &gt;&gt; This covenant is my covenant. This is what I want to preach today, brothers and sisters. This is my covenant. I can't help but think about how Caleb got to the place after they had crossed over. They were already in the promised land. What did Caleb do? He actually had eternal life. Well, he was there in the promised land, didn't he? The prophet of God said what eternal life is. &gt;&gt; It's living for others. &gt;&gt; And what what did he do? Caleb, a type of the bride. He followed the teachings of Joshua, a type of the Holy Ghost. He followed him. And what did he do? He helped positionally place all of his brethren and sisters in the land. Everybody got their place. But there came a time where he recognized, "Wait a second. Wait a second. and there's a covenant for me. And I just want to try and encourage us, brothers and sisters. Let's be like Caleb. And let's say, you know what, even though I know that I was 40 years younger when I came into this promised land, I I've labored a long time, but you know, there's still a mountain with my name on it, and I know the giants are there, but I know by the spirit of God that's living in me that I'm more than able to take that covenant because it's my covenant. &gt;&gt; He has given it to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And even though in my flesh I might be 80 and four years old, I'm just as strong as the first day that I went across Jordan and got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now give me my mountain. &gt;&gt; Just beautiful to think about this. I'll call the musicians as we end here in Joshua 14 10. And now, behold, the Lord hath kept me alive. A as he said these 40 and five years, even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness, and now, lo, I am this day four score and five years old. I'm sorry, he was 85. My I just can't help but think, if you're listening, Dad, you feel like you could climb a mountain and slay giants? My dad's 85 years old. As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me. As my strength was then, even so is my strength now for war, both to go out and to come in. Now therefore give me this mountain. &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me as we close here today. Wherefore the Lord spake in that day, for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were the giants, and that the cities were great and fenced. If so be the Lord be with me, then shall I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said. And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb, the son of Japuna, Hebron, for an inheritance. Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb, the son of Jeffuna, the Kennesite, unto this day, because that he followed that he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel. But we know, brothers and sisters, this was exactly what happened at Kadesh Barnea, isn't it? &gt;&gt; There was a deciding time. I either have to believe that this true baptism of the Holy Ghost is for me or or I just can't do it. Even though God said I could do it, maybe I want to substitute it with something else. He's he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And I want to encourage us, brothers and sisters. Even if we don't understand it, don't don't talk about bad about it. just ask God to reveal it to us, you know. And Hebrews 11, boy, I' I've got so many notes. I just I'm going to end. Hebrews 11, brothers and sisters, faith is the substance of things hoped for. It's the evidence of things not seen. &gt;&gt; For by it, the elders obtained a good report. &gt;&gt; I I want to encourage us to obtain a good report. I I have Ephesians 1, Ephesians chapter 1. Go and read Ephesians chapter 1 and think about the covenant. Ephesians chapter 4. Uh my it's so amazing. You know, brothers and sisters, I might sound like a fanatic when I get into it like this, but I I don't know much. I'm not theologically trained, but I can tell you exactly how it got lit. And how it got lit was by full surrender. by saying that I don't understand it and I I can't even comprehend it, but I know the word of God says that he will lead me and guide me into all truth. And so, I'm going to put it on him to lead me and guide me into all this truth that we're talking about today. And I guarantee you, he certainly will. &gt;&gt; God, richly bless you today. Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for your word. We thank you, Lord Jesus, that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. that you never change, Lord. That heavens and earth will pass away, but your word will remain. So, Father, help us to take the book and eat it up just like we read in the book of Revelation chapter 10. Help us, Lord Jesus, to recognize that's the only thing that's going to separate us from the rest of this world is to have a new birth. Oh, Father, that that word, oh Lord, living out through us your very life, &gt;&gt; Zoe, God's own life, &gt;&gt; through the baptism of our Holy Spirit. Father, we pray that you would just be with those who are away today, Father, wherever they are, those who might be tuning in. We know that you're more than able. You You fill all time and space, Lord. You're not bound by anything. And we just ask, Lord, that you would be with them and and comfort them, Lord. that you'd keep your hand upon them and bless their time away. And oh, Father, at the appointed time that you would bring them back safely. And Father, for our visitors here today, we pray that Lord, something of eternal value was ministered, Lord, that would encourage them. That Lord, they would just go with a a spring in their step, Lord, saying that they heard from you today. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would grant them traveling mercies as they go and have their time away as well, Father. Lord, we just want to ask that you would keep your hand upon each one of us, Father, as we go our separate ways today. Give us strength and encouragement, Lord. Help us, Lord, to draw from that inexhaustible fountain of the life that you have given us. Lord, help us, Lord Jesus, to recognize full surrender. Oh Lord, full obedience to the complete word of God entitles us to that token to be sealed until the day of our redemption. We love you and we thank you. We just commit each life into your hands now for your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Marvelous grace, marvelous grace of our loving Lord. grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt. Yonder on Calaryies Mount poured there where the blood of the lamb was split. Grace, grace. God's grace. Grace that will pardon and cleanse with him. Grace, grace. God's grace, grace that is greater than all our sin. Sin and despair like the sea waves cold threaten the soul with infinite loss. [Music] Yes, grace untold points to the refuge the mighty cross. Grace, grace God's grace, grace that pardon and cleanse. Amen. Praise God's grace. Grace that is greater than all my sin. [Music] Dark is the stain that we cannot hide. What can a veil to wash it away? Look, there is flowing a crimson tide, whiter than snow you make me today. Grace, grace. God's grace. Pardon plans within grace. grace. God's grace. Grace that is greater than all our sin. Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace freely bestowed. [Music] that are longing to see his face. Will you this moment his grace receive grace grace God's grace grace that will pardon and cleanse within grace. grace. God's grace. Grace that is greater than all our sin. Isn't it beautiful that that grace will wash us white? It won't whitewash us. It'll wash us from the inside out. &gt;&gt; Because of that grace, we can sing this song by Revelation. I'll fly away. Some glad morning when this life is over. &gt;&gt; Oh, some glad morning when this life is over, I I'll fly away to a home on God's celestial shore. I fly away. Are you going to fly? Hallelujah. I'll fly away. Oh, glory. I'll fly away. I'll never die. Halleluah. By and by, high. I'll fly away. And the shadows of this life have thrown up my way. Hallelujah. Like a bird from prison bars has flown. I fly away. I fly away. Oh glory. I'll fly away. I'll never die. Hallelujah. By and by, I'll fly away. Just a few.

By and by I fly away. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you ever think about that? That time where we recognize it's happening. This is it, brothers and sisters. It's going to happen. And the only reason it can happen is because of the original life. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that song today. It sounds like we want to sing. God's attributes. God's attributes were manifested to his bride. In this last age, we have caught the revelation by the last prophet's message. And we know who we are and what we're raised up for. Praise the Lord. It's the original life. Hallelujah. The original seed, Abraham's royal seed, glory. The son of man is revealed. The seventh seal is unveiled. The original life, the original sea. We are the word made flesh today. Book of Ephesians. Our names are seen within. Hallelujah. Yes, we are anointed and we are inspired by our God who's the original life, the original life, the original seed. The original word, it's what I believe. The son of man is revealed. The seventh seal is unveiled. The original light, the original seed. [Music] Saints will wake and join us for translation in this hour. Gentile days soon will be over. Glory hallelujah to our God. The original life. The original life. The original seed, the original word. It's what I believe. The son of man is revealed. The seventh seal is unveiled. The original life, the original seed. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Maybe as we close today, we'll just sing that song. You deserve the glory. You deserve the gloryy [Music] and the honor. Thank you, Lord.
