Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord welcome to church once again this time on a Sunday night for no other reason than to worship as brother Phil prayed one more time to Worship the Lord what an honor and a privilege it is to be here greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the name above every name God's chosen place of worship in our day in our age we're certainly thankful that we have Brethren that want to come together and put their shoulder to the wheel we know that this is a lot of pressure for everyone who's not used to doing it everyone from sound technicians to musicians to deacons and to Ministry but we trust that the Lord will be pleased that his will will be accomplished in our lives here this is uh this is the the age the only age where Satan was declared the God of this evil age and we have been chosen to be manifest in this age and you know uh it's just been spoken recently and it's just resounded with me that you know the more Satan comes against the bride in our day he doesn't wear the bride out what he does is he spins his wheels because what happens is every time he comes against the bride what he does is he pushes her closer to him he causes a greater Worship in her all she does is pushes her right back to the Tree of Life once again what an honor and a privilege it is to be recognized as the Bride of Jesus Christ not because of something we've done just because that seat Gene of God was in her from before the foundation of the world and that time that he came and sat down beside her and said get me a drink there is something inside her that just said my goodness I can't help it I I feel like I could get started but it's not my time tonight it's brother Toby's brother Toby we've come expecting we're excited we distrust that the Lord will bless the service tonight in a real special way that as we go forward that our our brothers and our sisters will have the opportunity to have more time to gather together to Fellowship this way we're certainly excited can we sing I love him as we invite brother Toby to come tonight just to take his Liberty speak to us What the Lord Has put on his heart just a course tonight [Music] I love him out I am because [Music] first lovely [Music] [Applause] tonight I've seen that once again I love him [Music] because he first love me and purchased mine solving on call Grace tree the Lord bless you brothers and sisters just a few of us here but I know um it's just a great opportunity to be in church on a Sunday evening I was thinking about it um you know based on what brother brand told us the first person to start an evening service was God himself he said in the cool of the evening it will come and have Fellowship with Adam and Eve and it's such a privilege for us to be gathered tonight and forgot to lay it in the heart of our pastor for us to have Sunday evening services I'm particularly thrilled that we have this opportunity I know there's something special that God has for us um in every service but of course when we have the evening service as well his presence will be as much here as he's always been bow with me this evening to say a few words to him dear father foreign to spend part of our day in your presence Lord we know your presence is always with us but it was also the word that told us their lord Jesus that we should redeem the time knowing that the days are evil and Lord that's interpretation Lord Jesus of the original Greek word Lord talks about time not as a space Lord Jesus of period Lord put more of an opportunity that every opportunity that we have to spend with you to build our relationship with you to be closer to you their lord Jesus to hear something that is good Lord in your sights that we take advantage of that opportunity that's what we're doing tonight dear Lord Jesus is not something we are used to to regarded Lord Jesus perhaps in the homes Lord around the screen their father listening to the word of God on a Sunday evening but Lord we've identified another opportunity their lord Jesus to to spend time with you because the days are getting more and more evil their lord Jesus and Lord we want to take advantage of every opportunity to get closer to you to hear more about you to hear less about the world and the things of the world we just pray you be with us tonight dear Lord Jesus Take me out of the way there Lord Jesus I've got nothing to present to your people Lord other than what you have Lord if it's from me Lord it will be a waste of time oh master I just pray there Lord Jesus let me step out of the way completely dear Lord Jesus and speak to us tonight dear Lord Jesus everyone there father Lord who's gathered here in the in the sanctuary Lord or even in their homes Lord May the presence of the Lord be there maybe felt their lord Jesus May everything become Lord that everyone will listen to the word that you have to say to us for this short period of time tonight dear Lord be with us dear father wherever your Saints are gathered Lord Jesus oh I've gathered Lord during the day May the words though Jesus Christ have been spoken May the mind of God has been expressed to the bride of Christ today their lord Jesus Builder up Lord until she be thoroughly furnished unto all good works according to the scriptures do this for us tonight their lord Jesus in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you thank you so much musicians the Lord bless you greatly you will please turn with me tonight I've got two portions of scripture to read first Joshua chapter 5 will take three verses Joshua 5 and verse 13. we go into verse 15. Joshua 5 from verse 13. and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that a lifted up his eyes and looked and behold Theirs to the man over against him with a sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him as thou for us or for our anniversaries and he said nay but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship and said unto him worship my Lord unto his servants and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua lose thy sure from off thy foot for the place we are on thou standest is Holy and Joshua did so let's just read Ephesians chapter 6 if you don't mind just four verses from there Ephesians 6 and verse 10. I'll read on to verse 13. says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the old armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the walls of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood and I want us to note here that he's saying that our contexts our contests or fight or our position is not against flesh and blood it's not against humans it's not against people that have flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places those are the things that we're going to fight that we're meant to fight against wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand let's speak to the author of the word their lord your Prophet said Lord Jesus is such a profound statement that any man can open the pages of the scripture and read something Lord out of it but Lord Jesus without the context of this scripture the reason for which you give the scripture is just theology we don't want theology tonight their lord Jesus we want Lord Jesus the real thing which is revelation Lord may you bring the revelation of your word to us tonight dear father that when we leave this place our feet will be light because we know that without an encounter like Jacob did their father when he met with you and his walk entirely changed let that be Lord Jesus Christ a refreshing of that anointing of the Holy Spirit Upon Our Lives their lord Jesus deep down within our souls their lord Jesus that will know that you've truly visited us tonight may you hear a prayer there Lord in Jesus name we pray amen may please be seated tonight I want to speak um on the weapons of our Warfare for adoption the weapons of our Warfare for adoption and tonight I want to hopefully by the grace of God will be done in good time I try not to hold people back on the evening service should be a short service I totally agree with that and I'm trusting the Lord to just say something to us tonight that will be a blessing um first part of my thought is from adoption you know brother Brian put the message adoption and the second path part of it program actually preached a couple messages that had to do with putting all the old Armor of God he preached putting on the whole armor of God but also preached on the greatest battle ever fought and we see in Joshua the first place we read you know brother Brahm told us in adoption that Joshua parallels Ephesians and the reason Weber LeBron said that is that in Joshua we found Joshua the seventh of Moses I always get fascinated by that you know the Bible explaining that Joshua was the seventh of Moses and Moses being the servant of God and Joshua the seventh of Moses was given a task that task was to take the people of Israel across Jordan but mainly the responsibility was for him to positionally place them in the Promised Land and the Brahma also told us that in our own age the Holy Spirit bringing us over Jordan Crossing Jordan from a life of sin to a life of righteousness brings us into a place where the Holy Spirit takes us and positionally placed Us in the body of Christ and looking at how this is also said that when Josh shouted them across the river Jordan and they go to the promised land they didn't just start to find their place they had to fight for every inch of ground and that's the same thing that happens when we become Christians when we become filled with the Holy Ghost when we become enlisted into the army of the Lord we are brought into a place where we've got to fight for every inch of ground so tonight I want to kind of take us into you know this the responsibility we have as soldiers of the Cross and when we're coming you know in the car we had gone out um before I came here with family um and my son was saying in the car Matthias was saying Oh Daddy I hear you preaching tonight and I said yes and he said Daddy what are you going to talk about I said well you just listen when I talk and you get to know what I'm going to talk about and he said Daddy I hope you tell us stories so I'm going to try to bring some form of story but actually what I want to do tonight is paint a picture of a drummer um dramatized this what I would call a mission briefing you know if you look at Joshua he would have had we ever read Joshua had already been given the commission it was given the commission to take the children of Israel into the promised land and positionally placed them but where we read showed us that cross Jordan that was when he had an encounter with a man and because Joshua had that Commission he had no fear he had no fear he came in there and the first thing he said to the man is are you for us or against us are you part of us or you are enemy because he had been given a commission that if you are my enemy you're gone you know he had no doubts there was no fear in his heart he didn't look at the stature of the man he didn't look at the weapons that the man had he had a commission that once I have anyone that's against me that person cannot stand and then he discovered that this person was actually the captain and if we go on to chapter 6 of Joshua he started by saying that the Lord told Joshua what to do God told Joshua you know that was when God actually gave instructions on how they were going to conquer Jericho but first he had to meet the captain of the Lost hosts and tonight I want us to also realize that The Holy Spirits is our commander-in-chief is the captain of the Lost host but in this Bible he has also told us what to do like the captain of the Lost horse came and told Joshua this is how we are going to conquer Jericho Jericho you've got enemies in Jericho the way you are going to actually get this is not just something that you're going to guess human intellects will say well we need to have a strategy we are going into a war this is how we're going to do it but the captain of the host of the Lord it was the only one that was qualified to give instruction I'm not never been on the military I've never been in any power military organizations such to say but we'll realize that in those organizations they don't just come together and go to a war for no you know without any instructions and I want to bring a bit to you know of of what I found online that this people this kind of military organizations do um when they're going to go into like an operation or a mission um so this is talking about Mission briefing here as the key to effective communication the few things I found fascinating and and we'll bring it and then we bring it to the world and let's see what the word has told us what has the war the word of God told us about how we should fight our enemy what are the things we need to know because when we know these things it brings us to an awareness now it says here nobody likes being in the dark the mind can play terrible games when you find yourself operating in a communication vacuum indeed the most carefully plans can be on the Mind by poor communication the feeling of anxiety brought on by an emergency or a rapid changing environment is what fighter pilots refer to as tumbleweed picture or tumble with blowing aimlessly at the mercy of the Wind when you tumble weed in the jet fighter that's exactly how you feel when I was reading that I was saying to myself that many times you get in situations and just because we are not Discerning of that situation based on what God has told us in the word we are in kind of a tumbleweed we don't know what's going on sometimes we put that blame on our brother sometimes on our sister sometimes on our spouses because the world has told us that we do not wrestle against flesh and blood many times because of our lack of awareness we focus on the flesh and blood now he said adrift with no situational awareness you are of no value to the mission or the team going dark and not knowing exactly what is happening can reduce even the seasoned combat pilot to a powerless ineffective second guesser and wreak havoc on your mission in combat and in business just because of lack of awareness he said the opposite of being in the dark is having high situational awareness or essay as we call it in the fighter pilot world situational awareness is the lifeblood of a mission being aware of the situation being aware of what's going on being aware of how to react being aware of the taxes of your enemy being aware of your own weapons as well what have we been given he said does the lifeblood of emission and it's a byproduct of knowing where you and your winged men are where you're going and all the variables that can affect the mission feral location of enemy to reign when you're situational awareness is high you can adapt to changes quickly and maintain Mission effectiveness without it you're useless now let's go to the word and just let's have a picture of the Holy Spirit giving us a brief you know Mission briefing tonight as soldiers of the cross that we are and I've got a few points here which I took from what the ram said in those messages there are five of them the first point is we are in a war LeBron said that the message testimony raisin dead boy 53 1203 he said you've got to go do it you've got to go fight for every inch of ground that you have every man in here that's born again of the spirit of God knows that you've had to fight for every inch of ground toward the mark to conform rigorously to a rule or standard that's the definition of to the mark with Satan we've got to tow the mark with Satan we know that I used to say that Satan is very aggressive and pushy and enforcing you know compared to the spirit of God that is very timid God will never Force his will on man but Satan forces his will we have daily comebacks with Satan like Paul said when I will do good evil is present he said my heart in my heart I desire to do what is right but when I want to do what is right evil is present he said it's clear it is not me that wants to do the wrong I'm not the one doing the wrong is the evil in me that is doing what is wrong but the problem said he's in that's right friends this is not a picnic this is a Battleground see we never come here to eat cookies and so forth we're in a battle and the first thing we need to understand is we're in a battle we face it every day many times when our situational awareness is low we don't realize that we're in the battle and then what happens is we are totally clueless we cannot interpret the situation correctly the second thing that you said soldiers of the cross is that the enemy can meet you anywhere the enemy this enemy that we are fighting it can meet us anywhere and if you actually think about soldiers um back in Africa when in Nigeria specifically um I think the Nigerian Army is well recognized for like ground level combats because you've got a rainforest so now in Nigeria there's a lot of um there's there's some Insurgency that's going on in the northern part of Nigeria we've got terrorist groups and because these people kind of hide under you know in the forest and all these soldiers need to actually get on the ground and attack the enemy and you realize that this kind of soldiers they've got to be aware of what's happening in their environment because a little lack of awareness could mean that they're going to lose their life so we must realize that we are in that kind of situation Satan comes to us and meets us just in any place it meets us on our mobile phones when we are actually trying to do something that is right it meets us when we're I think I should just let Robert Brown speak here but the brand said in putting on the old armor of God and so Paul here is speaking of a soldier dressing going to war and that's further down you know where we read if you actually go to verse 14 of Ephesians 6 it starts to talk about you know the putting on the old Armor of God what actually are those brother Paul was using an example of a Roman soldier to talk about the armor that we've got to wear as Christians and we'll get to that so brother Brown said Paul here speaking of a soldier dressing going to war a soldier getting himself in armor preparing for the battle and I kind of like the way that he places it preparation he said you know I believe it was Lincoln that said one time in the time of peace prepare for war or it might have been he but it sounds like seems to me rather it was he that made that statement in the time of peace prepare for war and that will be a good thing for us to think about in time when everything is running smooth you better get ready for Satan isn't going to let it run smooth very long you know I used to say to myself when I see my prayer life going down that's I shouldn't wait for God to bring a trial before I start to pray sometimes you see a trial comes to the family maybe someone is sick and that's when we actually get into having our prayer meeting our personal prayer meetings our personal night visuals that's why without the status is saying here that we should be ready before the battle actually comes you better get ready for Satan isn't going to let it run smooth very long you are in a convention now so that we're in a convention when program was preaching this message and everything will just pull along fine but you're going to live here in a few days and you are going to meet the enemy it might not even wait till you get ready to leave he might attack any time is wicked and ruthless it just carries on whenever he can whatever he can say or do he does it right now so it's best to be dressed all the time now but Abraham is giving us examples of where we can meet this devil you might meet him out on the streets how many of us have Mexican on the streets yeah it's getting to Summer now and you're going to see all the women dressed naked and you can hardly just focus because distractions there and there there's no way you look at they're all naked he said you might meet him in the car sometimes you're driving you're just doing the right thing and someone feels you've done something wrong and they use curse words on you you might meet him in the car remember I said we are not wrestling against flesh and blood those people are just vessels being used by Satan but God is there watching what our reaction is going to be because that itself is the battle remember what we are fighting for is the character of Christ what we are fighting for is to get to that place where we can say that we are fully conformed to the image of the son of God that's the promise that we've been given and that's what we are fighting for and that's what Satan is preventing us from getting to the brand said he will meet you right in the seats there and me writes are the pulpit here you know the first time I read it I said isn't Satan's kids to meet the prophet of the pulpit but the prophet said yes it could be a thought coming it could be him wandering away it could be him feeling less of himself and Satan telling him you know the people are not even listening to you that is the accuser of the brethren Iran said he might meet me and me right out of open here anywhere is just Wicked and he doesn't care so we want to be prepared for it amen glory to God let's hear the third point I think this will make us very excited he said our captain of the host knows the enemy so well and has given us the best weapon to fight the enemy with he knows the enemy so well that he has given us the best weapon to fight the enemy with but the brand says in the same message paragraph 23 so we find out that this secretes agents of the enemy that sits around each Nation now will equip its man with the latest equipment the very latest and they study and they do everything they are trying to counteract the other fellow's weapons and to get a little more modern weapons something with a little more punch to it from the bow and arrow to a musket and from a musket to a modern rifle and from that to an atomic they just keep building and it keeps them busy all the time and it's the nation's business if they want to survive they want to equip their soldiers with the best equipment that there is that's why a small nation that has that is even depending on let's say the US to supply military equipment to them will not just one day get crazy and say well I'm going to try and go fight the US because they know that they don't have the weapons that's as strong as what the US has got well God you know is infinite see it doesn't have to think anything better he just got the best to begin with see the nations are thinking about how to get better weapons how they move from boy and arrow all the way to atomic bombs now and even maybe some more but God doesn't have to get better God kneel it all from the beginning is not reducing the knowledge and wisdom is not increasing in knowledge and wisdom so you can't improve on it nothing to be done about it it just give us the best and I'm so happy that that's so simple because the same weapon he gave to Adam and Eve on the garden is the same weapon he has given to us that weapon is as potent as it was in the beginning is still as potent today so you can't improve on it nothing to be done about it it just gives us the best that is his word the weapon that God has given us is as simple as knowing that is just the word and if we look into you know I believe Matthew chapter 4 and I guess Mark chapter 4 as well we saw Jesus actually get into his own battle you know brother I believe brother James that said you know in the Bible that all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the Lost of the eyes the pride of life and if you go back to see the Temptation that Jesus went through you will realize that all that Satan tempted Jesus with were those three things the loss of the flesh if you are the Son of God take the stones and turn it to bread why because his body was hungry the flesh wanted food and he told him listen to your flesh rather than listen to the word and what Jesus did was he brought the word and said well this is my weapon this is what I've been given this will defeat Satan any day any time under any circumstance and when Jesus presented the word he defeated the enemy this next thing he told him I'll take you up to the temple you know look at everything the three has cast yourself down pride of life so that I can show that he's that powerful you know lust of the eyes he told him look at everything that's in this world take a short course I'll give them to you now Jesus didn't contest the fact that Satan owned everything in the world sit and claim that this is all mine the kingdoms of the world are mine Jesus they say no that's not true because actually Satan is the God of this evil age and Jesus admitted that that's true so these three things which were the three things that he fell for if you go to Genesis when he talked about the fruits you're going to see how the Bible described it it was good for food Pleasant to the eyes um and it was going to make one wise same thing lust of the flesh lost of the highest pride of life if failed to present the word but Jesus showed us the example you know we're going to also see what Eve said um and why she was wrong so God gives his people the best the very best and that's what he chose for his children the very very best but the program said I'm so glad of that I see God our Father and the kingdom that we are delegates of is infinite so the third thing let's remember a captain of the hosts are seeing C the commander-in-chief the Holy Ghost he knows the enemy so well and because it's infinite and knows all the things that will ever happen to us he knew it from the beginning he found the best weapon which is his word and gave that to us now the next point is your enemy will attack your weapon your enemy will attack your weapon so your enemy is aware that you have a very strong weapon and what the enemy is actually doing brothers and sisters Satan is not out to attack you Satan is out to attack your faith in the world because Satan knows that if you can doubt that word then he has no more work to do is just going to go on a vacation because everything we start crumbling because you have been disarmed he has taken your weapon from you so we've got to be aware that our enemy Satan will attack our weapon which is the word of God Abraham said here now we find out God gave his children the best and therefore you don't have to improve it it never changes he hasn't changed one bit since the first time he gave for his children his protection there's war in heaven you have to kick out Satan then you come down the Earth and fortified his children with his word I want to ask you something just think now if did not while she's standing on this great Fortress of his word now Satan was on the outside trying to use some kind of a technique to get her out of there for as long as she stayed behind the word everything was fine was looking for a technique to get Eve out of standing behind the work he knew that all he needed to do is just make her doubt the word that's where we make our mistake we make a mistake when we get from behind the world so I believe all Bible Believers think it that way we get from behind the word then we get in trouble but as long as we keep the word ahead of us LeBron said don't get ahead of the word let the word get ahead of you see you just let it go first and you just live right behind it let the word go first let the word direct her path David said your word is a lamp unto my feet and the light onto my path that word will guide me I will follow what the word says if the word tells me that whenever the doors are open I should be there then I shall be there because he knows what is best for me so Satan we attack our weapon sometimes we try everything he can to make us doubt the word Satan will try everything he can to make us not to even know the words because when you don't know the word then how can you brother Gilbert that told us that weeks back Faith comment by hearing the words if we fail to hear the word we cannot have faith so Satan we attack your weapon so we must be conscious of that we must have so much confidence in the weapon that we don't we guard it with all of our might and don't let Satan come to take us out of behind the world now the last one says to come out of this war as an overcomer every armor that has been given to you must be worn at all times we might not get the time to actually dig in into each of this armor that brother Paul talked about in Ephesians 6 but let's just read what program said as Bill Bram explained it in the message the greatest battle ever thought your mom said now listen all ye soldiers now how many of us are soldiers of the cross absolutely we have been enlisted into the army of God the Braham said that once you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have been enlisted into the army of God yes Satan was after you before you got the Holy Ghost but that was just Child's Play compared to what happens after you get the Holy Ghost but when I said that some people will tell you when you become a Christian it's a flowery Bed of Roses he said that's not true he said it's either that it's either they've not experienced it or they are telling you a lie he said when you become a Christian then Satan turns to you all of his weapons any way that he can get you it focuses his entire attention on you because then he knows that you are now an enlisted enemy now for us as soldiers of the cross The Prophet by the holy spirit is telling us this evening now listen to All You Soldiers now just before we start the prayer line take unto you the w h o l e the all not just part of it the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day but Abraham said the evil day is the day we are living in so can we say that God intentionally gave this inspiration to Paul the Apostle thousands of years ago to put this down write this letter to the Ephesians and God ensure that it was recorded so we can get this information to give us the situation awareness the situational awareness that we can't do without any of this um armor that we've been given but Iran said the evil day that's the day we are living in and having done all to stand stand amen get that see honey brother Brahman speaks to the Sick Sister when you don't know you can do to stand then stand don't move stand don't the only way that Roman soldier can keep standing is when he's still in good States because when the hour of the enemy hits it in a bad spot it can continue to stand it's going to fall now he's telling us how we can stand there for having your loins but the Bible said listen at this listen here what this is your loins that's your middle part here says guarded about with truth what is the truth the word of God that's right Thy word is truth all right and having on the breastplate of righteousness that is do what rights God the word of God in you doing what's right the bless the breastplate of righteousness and looking at the breastplate for the soldier covers the chest area and that protects the hearts because venara comes through you know without the breastplate on it goes straight into the heart that is instant death that is a do what's right God's the word of God in you doing what is right the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shut with the preparation of the gospel of peace and we probably don't appreciate you know the importance of wearing shoes but back in the day when they didn't have all the things that we had I think there was actually a story about maybe the Second World War I kind of or the first World War that's a particular set of soldiers had more Advantage because they had shoes on and that's why they were able to you know win the war your future to the preparation of the gospel of peace but the Brahm said go anywhere any place any time feet shot what the gospel see and look above all above all of it take the shield of faith and if we look at the shield out of all this armor that's brother Paul explained here you know apart from the only offensive one which is the sword of the spirit The Shield is the only movable Armory is the only one that you can you know there's an arrow coming you can turn this way to the back and use the shields to stop it and that's why he said above all take the shield of Faith that's the one that knocks off the dirts see the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fairy darts of the weekend and he said and take the helmet of salvation and I like the way that Abraham explained this here he said that's the soul the mind in here the head covers the head because your element is used to cover your head right and the sword of the spirits which is the word of God you know steps back a little bit to explain the helmet of salvation how are you going to get this element what it does it's a protection what is the Airmen made of brass brass can't even be tempered hard harder than iron a brass headpiece the Salvation now he explains it knowledge of knowing this so what's the element of Salvation the knowledge of knowing this and my healing comes from God my salvation comes from God my experience matches his word not the church's idea the word amen there you are covered over with a protection the ailment of Salvation Deliverance the knowledge of knowing that I'm a Child of God no matter what Satan is telling me no matter what my label is remember we talked about that the last time Satan can label us several things you're a compromiser you are this you get angry all the time but what's your identity your identity is who God says you are and having that knowledge of that identity identity is that element of salvation don't lose it don't let Satan take it away from you but if I'm saying now watch now I got hurried but I got to get in this Inn Satan's Army brings diseases That's what Satan is he's a destroyer Satan the whole Kingdom of Satan is sickness death and sorrow and frustrations and worry all on Satan God is life faith joy peace over here see now that's the two great forces that is coming together right now they are battling they are battling rights here in the building right now the battle day by day with you every Force so every day we are faced with circumstances I'll ask the musicians to come now we're faced with circumstances we are faced with situations where God is trying to build this character in US sometimes as a co-worker sometimes it's our spouses sometimes it's our children but let's remember it said we do not wrestle against flesh and blood we must be Discerning of the situation we must know that this that is coming against me is not my brother it's not my sister God is trying to test me what will Jesus do in this situation because we've got to realize like what the prayer was saying this morning the closest of the world we see of Jesus Is Us but Abraham said that in the seven Church ages the church had broke but the brown said that Jesus did not finish his work when he was here in flesh he let the rest for the church and that is as true as what it means Jesus did not finish his work Jesus did the part that he wanted to do by predestination but there's a whole lot that has been left imagine my neighbor will never ever see the physical Jesus I've even not had a chance to do it but how will Jesus represent himself to that neighbor he's got to be in me my wife might never see Jesus in the real sense of the physical Jesus she didn't live in Jesus's day but Jesus wants to be in me demonstrating himself to her Jesus wants to be in her demonstrating himself to me and that is what Satan attacks that is the battle that is the battle between right and wrong the right is US reflecting the Light of Christ you know I I I I actually listened to a message that preached years ago and and a bit of research I did about the Son and the Moon and we're talking about it you know just recently and to find out that the moon has its orbits and it goes around these orbits it has no light of his own it reflects the light from the Sun but then the amount of lights that the Moon is able to reflect reflects the Earth is based on the position of the Moon compared to the Earth and he says that anytime we have a super moon that moon is an opposition that is closer to the Sun and it's able to reflect 20 percent more light and when I read that I remember that the Brahm said that there is going to be a super Church a super race as we near the headstone what does that mean as we are nearing the coming of the Lord more of the character of Christ must be reflected in my life I must reflect more of Christ than the first church age than the second Church Aid and the third then the fourth and fifth the sixth because I am the one that is closest to the headstone so it's a huge calling but today in this age and in this time in this generation we are the ones that have been called and brother Brown said the evil days are now it's tougher for us than it was for the Saints of old there's so many things to contend with but one thing I'm most grateful for is that the weapon that was delivered to them is still as potent today as it was then if Jesus used it against the devil and was able to conquer the devil if I use the word of God against the devil today I will definitely conquer the devil so that's the briefing tonight the Holy Spirit has given us a briefing I trust that we have a better situational awareness remember he said that that devil that enemy he can meet you anywhere right here on the seats as you go out sometimes someone will do something and Satan will start to tell you in your heart to you do you know that that person doesn't love you yeah I once had the experience I went somewhere to preach and whilst I was waiting I don't know if I said the story before a brother came to me um in the in the pastor's office and said he had something to tell me that some time ago we I think everyone was together he wanted to greet me and I didn't answer him and he felt that I had something against him and that was many months I mean months before was when it happened he felt I had heard something about his family and when that thought dropped into him because I wasn't even a minister dead something told him that if this brother becomes a minister tomorrow what will happen and months down the line there I was visiting the church to preach and he came to tell me I said to him brother I don't even know your name apart from your first name I know nothing about your family but Satan dropped that in his heart and gave him a complex so we have this battle happening in our lives every day brings argument between a husband and wife something later happens a misunderstanding and Satan starts to take you bring kind of thoughts I mean I'm speaking to myself and that is that is the foundation of depression [Music] those thoughts that Satan will bring the things he tells you that are not real tells you about the other person tells you about your situation tells you about the future you realize that faith and fear are both about the future one is the truth about the future the other is a lie about the future you never fear what is past you always fear what is going to happen and that is Satan telling you trying to you know another way I like to explain it which I heard someone say is just take fear as an acronym it means false evidence appearing real it is false it is not true but Satan is pushing that to you to tell you this is going to happen but what is faith the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not sin both of them are evidences one is true by the word of God the other one is false because Satan is the one bringing it so we've got to encounter these things day by day it is the way the Lord designed it to be the inspiration that came on the brother that wrote only believe one of the verses said your Shepherds selected the path you must trade because he knows that he's leading the right way to get us to a place where we become conformed to the image of his son with me tonight [Music] let's all just take a moment to speak to the Lord is the captain of The Host is our commander-in-chief [Music] is giving us [Music] a briefing tonight so to say spoken to us as soldiers of the cross enlisted to the army of the Lord [Music] let's just respond to him and say Lord I agree I agree that the things you have said are true but I need Grace I need your help to do just what you've instructed me to do your grace [Music] foreign Lord Jesus for speaking to us tonight Lord appears very simple straightforward but Lord Jesus We Know by your word that you hide yourself in simplicity and you reveal yourself in the same Lord Jesus thank you may you take this word from letter and may you reveal it by your spirit in our hearts you said the words that I speak unto you their spirit and their life Lord just help us when we when we get into those situations when our enemy law just comes against us may this just Lord be brought back to our memory you said to the disciples their Lord Jesus it's so remarkable there father help those men had trusted so much in you that literally Lord Jesus tied their lives around you they got asked questions about tasks about about tax Lord Jesus it was you that told them what to do Lord the Pharisees blame them accuse them of things nor they run to you Lord you speak in Parables they don't understand what you've said to the multitude and Lord Jesus when they get together with you alone they ask you questions and one day you looked at them and said you're going to depart and Lord I can only imagine how sad that they felt their lord Jesus but you gave them Lord a promise you said I'll send the comforter Lord what you literally told them is that I'm your comforter today but I'm going to send my spirit which will be me in spirit form to be your comforter so you won't have to miss me Lord we have no excuse dear Lord Jesus you've given us the Holy Spirit is as good as you were here there Lord Jesus and one of the things he said the holy spirit will do is that the things you have told us including what you have told us tonight the holy spirit will bring you to our remembrance Lord at that time our own guarded moments when the flesh is about to take over and do what the flesh will do May the Holy Spirit bring this words to our remembrance dear Lord may we do the right thing there Lord Jesus according to the word may we show the character of Christ may we do what Jesus will do in those situations dear Lord thank you dear father for this opportunity to come in your presence Lord this evening and we know their lord Jesus that truly your presence has been with us may you your presence Lord forever go with us dear Lord Jesus we don't want to be outside of your presence there Lord Jesus Moses said if your presence will not go with us then then then let us remain here Lord Let Your Presence go with us make us not what you want us to be and help us Lord Jesus to continue to realize that we are not fighting a battle that we are not sure what will happen but we are fighting from victory because you've given us the victory already let us Lord Jesus just know that by revelation thank you Lord Jesus bless everyone that's Lord sacrificed their time lord Jesus they have redeemed the time and Lord gathered around whether I be there screens in the home Lord computers all those have even been here in church their lord Jesus bless everyone May the reason that why we are doing this dear Lord Jesus may not be in be in vain dear Lord Jesus thank you Father for such a wonderful time tonight we give you all the glory and the praise knowing that you will give us a wonderful week Lord where will world where we will see your grace dear Lord Jesus just bring the word of God to pass in our lives thank you Father for all you've done Jesus Christ then we'll pray amen Victorious mind victory is mine make a big day is mine you've got the right to tell him I

definitely heard from the Lord tonight we're certainly thankful thank you brother Toby for surrendering yourself thank you I just have to read a scripture I have to second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare or not carnal but they're Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ understanding that either fear or faith is going to take hold in our lives brothers and sisters and they're both about the future and one is truth and one is a lie what a tremendous point that is that's going to stick with me forever one is truth and one is a lie we're certainly thankful for The Healing Hand of the mighty Jehovah that we know we're thankful for his healing and in all of our lives so many different ways we definitely want to go forwards With Victory brothers and sisters not go forwards with fear doesn't matter what's happened around us doesn't matter what's happening in anybody else's life it's only about me that's what this walk is about can we sing one more song before we are dismissed people might laugh at this but I don't really mind because you know what we heard it tonight we said it this morning we've said it before we are the only Christ that many people will see in this world this one's for the kids [Music] This Little Light of Mine [Music] This Little Light of Mine I'm gonna let it shine This Little Light of Mine I'm
