Is there a heart that is waiting
Longing for pardon today
Hear the glad message we bring you
Jesus is passing this way

Jesus is passing this way
This way today
Jesus is passing this way

Coming in love and in mercy
Quickly now unto Him go
Open your heart to receive Him
Pardon and peace He'll bestow

Trust in God's mercy and live

He is so near you today
Open your heart to receive Him
While He is passing this way
