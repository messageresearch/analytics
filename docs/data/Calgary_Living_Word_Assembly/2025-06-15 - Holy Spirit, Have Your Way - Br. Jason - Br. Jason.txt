========================================

[Music] Long after the tears fall, I'm still your child. I put down my defensees and lay down my pride. Love and forgiveness flowing deep and wide. So I'll run to you and surrender all as I lay down my life and pick up my cross. What a joy it is to give my life away to you. All that I need and all that I seek is you here with me. Holy Spirit, have your way in me. [Music] In times of trouble, though trials may come, the rock of ages still standing strong. I'm fighting battles, but the war is won. So I'll run to you and surrender now as I lay down my life and pick up my cross. What a joy it is to give my life away to you. All that I need and all that I see is you here with me. Holy Spirit, have your way in me. Hallelujah. More of you and less of me. God, more of you and less of me. God, more of you and less of me, my God. More of you overflowing [Music] as I lay down my life and take up my cross. What a joy it is to give my life away to you. All that I need and all that I see is you here with me. Holy Spirit. As I lay down my life and pick up my cross, my joy is to give my life away. [Music] All that I need and all that I see is you here with me, Holy Spirit. Spirit, have your way in me over and over again. Holy Spirit, Lord Jesus, have your way in me. [Music] [Applause]
