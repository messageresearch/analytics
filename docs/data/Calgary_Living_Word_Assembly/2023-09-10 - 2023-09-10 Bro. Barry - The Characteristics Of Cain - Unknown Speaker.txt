that that imprinting by the parents God bless your parents for the work that you do to do that with your children God bless you stand with me if you would as we call our pastor this morning word of God ever true that holy word has been preserved Through the Ages it's been said by critics that the Bible's been written by many different people how could it be consistent well it's the same author that's so what's so wonderful it's the same author same holy ghost that spoke through those prophets of old spoke through the New Testament it's been preserved we've been so blessed if you haven't seen this I don't know if I've advocated movie but the movie of John uh starting Martin Luther is quite amazing to see how he he the passion he had to get the Bible in print form it was in German but then of course it was translated in English just a wonderful story of how much labor he put into making sure we had the holy word preserved in our in our hands oi ticket for granted I have how many bibles in my home but here we are today holy word it's preserved and it's preserved in our hearts this morning well holy word long prison for our walk in this world what an instruction book it is

welcome to the house of the Lord we know the word says that we're two or three are gathered together in his name that he's there in the midst you know that wasn't just a story about the apostles in a home hidden away in Jerusalem that's the word of God for us today so I believe he's right here in our midst he's with us right now anyone who might be listening online if you've gathered together in the name of Jesus Christ he is there with you what a tremendous blessing it is if you have a need this morning maybe just make it known unto him with an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word thank you for the sacrifice Lord that was made throughout all of the ages Lord Jesus for your word or to think that there's people that were saw in asunder they were fed to Lions Lord Jesus so that we could have that word today oh Father help us to just cherish that word Lord help us to follow your word and esteem that word greater than even Your Name Lord father we love you and we thank you for your goodness to each and every one of us Lord we all have needs in our lives and father we pray that as we sang this song that it wouldn't just be a song we sing that but Lord that you would change us as we hear your word today Father Lord that you would change our hearts Lord that we would not leave this building that we would not leave our living rooms wherever we are whatever we're doing if we're a part of this service that we would not be the same when it's over lord Jesus father we know that we can't be we cannot come in contact with

these bodies have to fail on this side but father we know that your word will never fail and there comes a time appointed of the father where Lord we have to either go by the way of the sky or the way of the grave but we know neither one will stop your word from coming to pass in our lives and father we just want to pray that you would be with sister vanderplast that you would give her strength

you we'd also like to welcome sister Lou Lucio Rosa from Cameroon she's with brother Joe's way and sister Becky today welcome sister we look forward to getting to know you spend a little bit of time please be sure to welcome our sisters in our midst and I would just like to take a moment and thank thank sister feifei where's sister Fife is she with us here sister Zoe and brother Jason thank you for that special today amen you know I know some churches that are very closed and very cautious and and very not interested in letting the little people take part in the service and I want to say this from my position in my office I'll say it that if we don't involve the little people while they're little people who's going to be there to worship when they get to be old people what's going to happen is they're going to leave they're gonna say it's an old People's Church and I don't want to live in an old person's church I want to live in a church that's got a spirit of people that are about 19 or 20 years old because that's the spirit of Christ that's where we're going brothers and sisters we don't want to be starchy folks here that are dried up old sticks we want to be happy and on fire for the Lord and what better way to do it than encourage the little children my goodness I just think it's wonderful I just want to encourage all the children if you feel led of the Lord you want to sing a special you're welcome to but make it reverent we don't do it to show we're not interested in trying to perform we want to bring a sacrifice of praise to the Lord when we sing a special it's to the Lord Jesus Christ God richly bless you each one my goodness one more little announcement we have a baptism today after service certainly looking forward to this thank you and I know our dear sister jar main is looking forward to this it's her son brother Doty kakuji Hallelujah what a glorious thing for the Revelation to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not in in in in a bunch of titles but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's tremendous so we have little baptism after service and uh yeah let's just get into the word sorry to keep everyone thank you musicians I want to continue on where we left off last week I just believe there's a still a little bit of anointing there so we'll read from Genesis chapter 4. Genesis chapter 4. we'll just start with verse one and Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived in Bear Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord and she again bear his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of the Sheep but Cain was the tiller of the ground and in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the first Links of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very Roth and his countenance fell my Bible says on the sideline there that he was angry and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou Wrath and why is thy countenance Fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him and Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord so thankful for your word so thankful that you've given us the ability to read your word Lord with spiritual understanding Lord I know many people have been trained according to theological studies many people can speak eloquently Lord and father we desire to not be tillers of the ground and to be eloquent but we desire to live by Revelation father and we just pray that one more time you would just Reveal Your word to us as we go forwards Lord Jesus that when we leave this building we would say that truly we heard from you we just want to commit this service into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated just a few quick announcements we have the Youth Event this afternoon at the Clawson residence and I'm sure everyone has the information if you don't by all means reach out it's for the Youth um starts at two o'clock and ends at five I do apologize if the baptism holds people up it's the way it works we can't change these things and we're certainly uh thrilled that somebody wants to get baptized so by all means if you need to rush away then feel free to do that we don't want to keep anyone the time is from 2 P.M to 5 p.m lunch will be served and uh yeah I think it's a wonderful thing to have it on a Sunday because we have Monday the next day and it's important for everyone to recognize we have responsibilities and even the hosts they don't really want to have people too late in their house they have responsibilities the children have to go to school Etc so it'll be a wonderful time this afternoon I'm sure of fun and fellowship Thursday September the 14th we've got a prayer meeting at 7 30 at the church here Sunday September the 17th we have a 6 PM communion service and Wednesday September the 28th we have brother James new Vande Bandy here and certainly look forward to seeing him I really enjoyed seeing uh our other brother that was here I don't know why I'm drawing a blank right now yeah brother Herbert mccobba we had such a wonderful time we actually had a little birthday celebration and we took him with us uh after service the next day it was really kind of fun we went to a bike track and we had brother Herbert riding a bike on the track he had a wonderful time it was just real good so uh are you happy this morning uh one more thing I wanted to mention is uh you know starting in October I felt led for a little while to do it and uh so we're gonna go for it I believe the blessing of the Lord is upon it we're going to do an in-depth study on the uh revelation of the seven Church ages that'll be a Wednesday night study and I believe it's going to be in depth and it's going to take a long time because I want to go cover to cover from the very first word to the very last word of that book and just trust that the Lord will bless it and uh you know maybe we'll take a break here and there just to maybe just preach a little bit but I think it's important to understand what that book has to say and it's important to understand what what that book means to the believer today so we'll just take Wednesday services and we'll just go through that and just take our time and I'm sure questions will rise along the way and uh you know we'll just deal with everything accordingly and I just wanted to mention if anybody doesn't have a book like a hard copy book of the revelation of the seven Church ages we're happy to get them we have 10 copies right now in the church but we'll get more if you would like them if you don't if you just want to study digital that's fine likely we'll have the quotes up on the screen so um I think it will work out just fine but there's so much in there I believe it really is the essence of the message of the hour it gives us the ability to just study a little bit further on some of these doctrinal things that we believe and why why we believe them we don't believe them just because somebody said we should believe them we believe them because they've been revealed to us and how do they get revealed to us we can say that you know we hear maybe a man put it in a book and he's written it down and he said it but we can take everything that's said in that book and bring it right back to here it's not just something that we're saying wow it's it's a man's book and and he got some special glasses and he found some some Golden Plates and an angel came around and revealed something to him no that would be just fine Brother Branham says I have no doubt that that happened speaking about Joseph Smith and and the Mormon doctrine that would be just fine Brother Bradham says I have no doubt that that happened that an angel came and revealed a furtherance to a word but it wasn't taking it back to the word and that's the critical difference and if someone would just take the moment to listen to what is said in that book they would see that it's exactly what the Bible says and I think when you believe the Bible and you have a man that actually brings something that actually opens up the word I don't know how you can look away and say it's just a man it just causes something on the inside of the inside to say Amen to that word so anyways uh starting in October on the fourth we'll uh just begin that call it a series and we'll just see what the Lord will do um there's many many points inside there that I really am excited to get into but we'll get there talking about our scripture this morning we didn't really go further with it but we can now as we come back to the word maybe we'll just start with verse 8. of Genesis chapter 4 . I didn't really get to where I wanted to um because I wanted you to sit down I didn't want to have all the announcements and keep you standing and it's better if we don't get nervous if we can just relax around the things of the Lord we want to have peace verse 8 of Genesis chapter four says and Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper I want to go back to where we were last week and talking about this the characteristics of that answer is not of God that is not The Offspring of Adam that is not even a human answer that's a satanic answer to cough it up to God to his face to say to him I know not I'm just going to lie first actually first I'll murder them or actually first I'll get angry because you tried to correct me but because I'm not a child of God I can't receive correction when it comes to me so I'll reject it I'll Rebel and then I'll go and kill my brother because I know he has the true revelation and you know we heard brother Branham say it we can kill people just by assassinating their character we don't have to actually go and kill him physically and you know it gets really important and really heavy because really fast too I believe because the blaspheme the Holy Ghost is the unpardonable sin isn't it and you know what that is to call The Works of God The Works of the devil so God is working in a brother or a sister what happened here is Cain blaspheme the Holy Ghost we'll call it the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost wasn't given yet I know that I get it I know people are looking at me but you know what the Holy Ghost is God isn't it isn't it God and isn't that Jesus Jesus wasn't standing there but it was God it was the spirit of Jesus that came down and spoke to him in the garden and said you know Cain where's your brother knowing full well where he was but what happened was he said his blood speaks and we talked about it last week isn't it wonderful that the blood speaks there's some quotes for it but it's tremendous that the blood speaks I'll just read from the token in 630901 m Paul tells that the blood speaks it's paragraph 355. Paul tells us that the blood speaks that anyone knows that the blood is actually itself it can't speak it's a chemistry is that right how many knows that but how many knows that the blood speaks if you want to put that down Genesis 4 10 God said what about your brother said his blood cries from the earth against you is that right his blood is speaking Hallelujah God said what about him and he said am I My Brother's Keeper can you imagine that right excuse me right to the face of God said and his blood is crying out his blood is crying out it's a token it's a token that he had been killed his blood was crying out against him now if you get that in Genesis 4 10 then in Hebrews 12 24 start reading Hebrews 10 12 24 said the blood of Jesus speaketh better things than that of Abel Abel had a revelation that it had to be a lamb to sacrifice to atone for the sin of man to atone for the sin of his parents imagine that brothers and sisters job was making sacrifice for his children but what about the children making a sacrifice for the parents maybe the parents just don't have the Revelation maybe the parents just don't have the ability to see what we can see oh my but I believe the children have the opportunity to make a sacrifice for the parents see Abel he was a righteous man he died innocent because he was in the way he was in the way standing for the real Revelation he had and isn't it wonderful he wasn't given the instructions he wasn't told go and take a lamb and sacrifice it it was a revelation that came to him and it was magnified in the gospels when Jesus asked Peter he asked his disciples who who do people say that I am and some said Elias and some said a prophet and and some said other things maybe a pastor a good man but he said now let's let's bring it down to home it's nice to talk about what everyone else is saying but who do you say that I am and one of the disciples had a revelation and he said Thou Art the Christ the sent one the son of the Living God the scent anointed one Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and God or God Jesus said to him he said it to him directly wow Flesh and Blood hath not revealed that to you Peter Simon barjona but my Father in Heaven My Father which is in heaven has given you a spiritual Revelation the same thing that happened to Abel he was given a spiritual Revelation but look at the characteristics of this brother of his his brother was a liar his brother was a murderer and the manifestations of that had to come out in his life it's terrible isn't it oh my but look at the lineage of Jesus Christ David had adultery and David had had murder inside of him that Jesus God had to get out of him but it didn't change the word of God it didn't change the Throne of David we know we talk about the Son of God the son of man the son of David the son of man Ministry is what we're under right now son of man Ministry I don't want to go too far with that but see Abel was a righteous man he died innocent because he was in the way he was in the way standing for the real Revelation he had he it's he spoke it cried out the Justice blood of Abel cried out against Cain but the blood of Jesus Christ not only cried out it redeemed amen that speaketh better things it makes you Sons and Daughters it hides you from the wrath of God see the blood of Abel could not hide Cain see but the blood of Jesus can amen so old Cain came out today if you've been a persecutor against the word say the days of Miracles has passed the thing is all nonsense and things it's crying out you see the blood of Jesus Christ Cries Out but there is forgiveness in it if you'll just accept it wish we could stay a little while on that see the blood speaketh better thing I think we can stay a little while on that today I don't think we have to rush away from that I think it's important for us to recognize even though we're not talking about a Dodie old grandpa that's sitting on a cloud playing a harp and having Angels worshiping him he's he's not in that position is he even though he is on the throne and even though he does have the white wig of supreme deity supreme justice he has love and he wishes Grace and peace unto you his bride he's not looking to judge us the only thing that's going to happen is he's going to judge all of the people who choose to not judge themselves here on this side the people who choose to not judge themselves according to the word of God on this side that was given by a Vindicated Prophet through every single age there was no change to that there's there's this idea that somewhere along the way God stopped using prophets I don't know why or where that came in because we can see we've talked about it many times where God started using prophets it was because mankind cried out and said it's too frightening don't let God speak let Moses speak because if God speaks we want to die so God said all right if that's what you want I'll give you a prophet no problem but when he says thus saith the Lord you better perk up your ears and listen to what he has to say and only some people have the ability to do that why is it because it's a spiritual revelation and that spiritual Revelation I'm so thankful for a prophet in our day that would say that spiritual Revelation it doesn't cause people to puff up it causes people to become humble to recognize that outside of the goodness of God the grace of God to individuals personally they would never hear that voice we'd never be able to say that God sent a prophet but isn't it wonderful to think that there's a blood that cries out for us even right now that blood is still on The Mercy Seat crying out that blood is still calling people there's still people that want to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we know we know full well there's coming a day it's never been closer where there's going to be a general resurrection and rapture the church is going to go into Glory that certain group of people that was elected to do it it's not up to us to say anybody's in or out it's it's up to God and God alone but those who are elected to go in that will subject themselves to the word we look at judgment in the face right here and judgment here is the word of God you know you many times you'll hear people say well I could never live it and you know what we can never live it that's why we say you've got to get the Holy Ghost because you'll never live it on your own you'll try it and you'll fall down flat on your face but those with the Holy Ghost will get back up again those are the Holy Ghost will go back to church again and they'll have the desire in their heart to say Lord forgive me judge me here search me and try me because I want to be right I want to be judged here I don't want to stand before that white Throne of judgment because if we stand there brothers and sisters it'd be better for us to not have known about this message here on this side of Eternity oh my God because there'll be people over there that never heard of it that have never heard of it but they'll stand before that white Throne of judgment and they'll know that it's a word judgment between that step where they're at in front of that throne and the Lake of Fire one word of judgment but isn't it wonderful to think that we have been given that ability now to have that word of grace to the people around us we can say that that rock that was rejected by the builders they had that became the corner has come down and it didn't cry I'm gonna destroy you it cried Grace Grace unto it we've been given the ability to recognize it's only by Grace We're saved through faith because there's a blood that cries out for us I just think it's wonderful looking at this scripture here just to see the identity the characteristics of Cain's father the characteristics of Cain's father is that he's a murderer he's a liar and he's not afraid to just stand right in the face of God and just say to him it's not my problem am I My Brother's Keeper it's not my problem why don't you go look for them yourself that's exactly what he was saying without saying it am I My Brother's Keeper we are our Brother's Keeper we are our Sister's Keeper it is up to us we will answer for our behavior on this side my goodness it's so important for us don't ever blaspheme the work of God and a brother or a sister don't ever do it brothers and sisters I would say that is thin thin ice that's getting right out there on a very thin Branch you might not be able to come back on the tree you might just snap off and fall down we want to make sure that we understand God is going to move and when God moves it's going to be according to his word it's not going to be according to our thinking it's not going to be according to what we think should happen maybe our Traditions sometimes we have family traditions sometimes we have church Traditions I want to say we're having some fellowship this week brothers and sisters don't try and take Calgary Living Word assemblies Spirit take the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ into your heart that's the only thing that will save you even saying that you're a part of the message of the hour won't save you unless you actually believe what the message of the hour was sent for yeah right that's to get you the baptism of the Holy Ghost so you've got the token so you can say hey I've got that token and I can take that token and I can remind the Lord that I've got that token he gave it to me and I've got it and I also want Satan to know I've got that token and you know as a father as a husband I'm going to take that token and I'm going to hold it over my family I'm going to hold it over every single child when I pray for them that they will have the desire someday to come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost because that's the only thing that's going to save them brothers and sisters not going to church not saying I've got books and tapes not saying I've been to Jeffersonville not saying I've done anything other than I've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost my goodness I just want to say it if you don't got it get it you don't understand ask because it's the only thing that's going to save us whether we go by the way of the Grave or whether we go by the way of the sky if you don't want to stand before that white Throne of judgment get the baptism of the Holy Spirit and what is the baptism of the holy spirit it's the spirit of Jesus Christ it's it's the life the literal life of Jesus Christ Living out through his bride body but you know it's a nasty trick of the devil for people to think that they can get baptized in the name of a father and of a son and of a Holy Ghost and and that they would truly receive the Holy Ghost in their lives because the formula is to get baptized in the name and not names not a plurality in a name and we know full well if we think it's fine and good just next time I've said it many times I'll say it again just go and write a check and write father sign father on that check and and and give it what will happen we all know what will happen that check will bounce the people who checked checks who do the Sorting Center they'll say that's weird who is a father and they'll send it back nobody wants to have service charges why why couldn't we write a check in the name of father but we can go and say I'm going to get the Holy Ghost by the name of father who's the father who's the son who's the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ and anything else brothers and sisters is a trick it's deception it's it's a trick of the devil to get us to believe that everything is okay don't worry you shall not surely die if you partake of that fruit in the garden don't don't worry just one word if you want to see how how deceitful Satan is it's not a whole volume it's not a brand new Bible even though some charlatans have come around and done new books and different things it's it's not that it's one word off it's destruction one word off is judgment one word off caused the fall of all Humanity but there's a blood crying out for us if we're willing to accept it if we're willing to come his provided way and here's the thing I just want to say this it's just and then I'll move on I'll stop if you don't understand water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's not like we're saying you know if you've been baptized in titles and and we want to encourage you to come according to the right formula it's not like we're saying just go and get baptized in the name of of Barry Allen Johnson go and do it you'll get the baptism of the Holy Ghost that'd be crazy wouldn't it we're not saying that we're saying get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins so that you and your family could be saved so that you can receive the baptism the Holy Ghost I know many people here have been I know many people get this I know there's some people that don't though and I think it's incredible because it's our only ticket out of here it's the only way that we will be saved brothers and sisters and this is a time to preach fire and brimstone it's not a time to say it's okay we're just all inclusive let's just get together and and sing Kumbaya this is time to get in the boat what was it like in the in the 124th year that Noah was there preaching the gospel about get in the boat get in the ark do you think he got quieter I can only imagine he got loudspeakers and he set him up all around the ark get in the boat it's gonna rain but they all said oh he said charlatan he's he's a Madman he's up there he's got sunstroke on his bald head listen to the old man beating on the wood there saying it's gonna rain we can scientifically prove that there's a father and a son and a Holy Ghost and you'll get the Holy Ghost just the same way you're not the only Pebble on the beach look at our boat we've got a boat over here that we've built that's just as big and just as strong but it wasn't God's it wasn't the way God wanted it there was eight Souls saved out of how many millions of people that was the message for that day the message for today is get the Holy Ghost or perish or perish but right now we're so lucky we've got a blood that cries out for us looking at this characteristics of Cain the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wrath and why why are you angry why did thy countenance fall it says if thou do us well Thou shalt shall thou not be accepted and if thou doest not will sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall shall be his desire and and shall Thou shalt rule over him that means that his father will actually be what his desire is and we know that his father was Satan it's a big discussion but it's true we know that it can make people uncomfortable but it's true because any of these attributes are not of God and any of these attributes are not of Adam and we know that Adam was the son of God directly we could say maybe somewhere there's a mutation because Eve was came out of the side of Adam and she wasn't created directly by God no only because he had a different father it's another discussion we're not going to get into now I just don't feel too led to go that way but I just want to say it this way isn't it interesting to see the attributes of him as soon as correction is brought he gets angry so we can look to the back of the Bible and see very clearly that those people who refuse chastisement they have that nature don't they oh my I'm rich I'm increased with Goods I don't have need of anything you got to tell me my pastor told me my parents taught me we've got the religion we've got everything we need our fridges full our bank accounts are great we've got rrsps until the cows come home there's nothing going to happen here maybe we've even got a bunker underground in the mountains because we know things are going to go sideways somewhere along the way we've got a Year's worth of provision everything is fine but is it miserable wretched blind and don't even know it we know that it says in the word I counsel thee to buy of me gold that's tried in the fire the pure word of God take that and and put it on take that and put it inside of you but just looking at these attributes here how Cain had these attributes and and he just he couldn't be corrected you ever know anybody that just can't be corrected doesn't matter what you say it all just gets spun around this gets twisted and and and spun around to match a certain way you know we all need to be corrected every single one of us the word says how how much do we endure are parents correcting and maybe that's part of the problem sometimes parents didn't correct us maybe I never got spanked enough I know there was a time in my life where I got it at school and I got it at home and I deserved it but that's the way it goes we we have our lives to live and if we can't accept the correction in our lives then we're not going to be very good children but the word of God says that if we can't accept chastening of the Lord the word of God can't sort us out then we're not his children so when the word of God comes you're knocking on my door I hear it I think oh Lord have mercy I I know that I failed you in this point and in that point and in the other point and I look back in my life and think about all the points and I think Lord have mercy when the word comes around what do I want to do I want to line up with it I don't want to say oh no it's all good I'm fine don't don't pick on me preacher I'm I'm fine everything in my life is good when we take that approach whose nature do we have whose nature is knocking at our door and what lieth at our door if we have that nature we know the word of God says sin lieth at our door so I just want to fast forward a little bit let's turn over to Matthew chapter 18 real familiar scripture we I think we kind of got into it last time we know that uh the the first part or maybe the middle part of Matthew chapter 18 is commonly referred to is how you deal with the situation in the church and you know I don't really want to go too far into that but you know if somebody does something wrong God has a provision for us a direction and instruction if somebody does something wrong then you go to your brothers what the word of God says you don't go to his neighbor and you don't go to somebody else and tell them what they did and how you're offended and what the problem is you go to your brother you go to your sister and you make that problem right but if that person won't hear you then you take a witness you bring someone with you and say look I tried to make this right and they won't listen it's according to the word of God I know this thing is wrong and and they just won't listen to me so now we bring a witness and if they still won't hear you then you bring it to the church and say look this brother the sister this thing they just you know and and of course there's a word of God and it gives us instruction how to do it we're not looking to find people to put out I've had a contentious issue over this at one point and I'm not interested in really trying to have a contentious issue but it is contentious many times people are real anxious to put people out and I think we need to just take a step back myself my opinion my view Jesus he took a woman who was caught in the act of adultery and what did he do to throw her out of the temple by her hair down the stairs and said you rotten woman get lost go get right and come back to church no he said woman where are thine accusers he who hath no sin in your life you just go ahead and cast the first stone that's the way the Lord deals with us and I think it's so amazing because I don't really find very many examples of even brother Branham putting people out of the church he did say there was a son that wouldn't listen he was an unruly boy and he wouldn't listen and he started running around and doing bad things and he still wouldn't listen and they took a witness and he still wouldn't listen and they put him out of the church and he said that you take someone and you put him out from under the blood and you watch him come crawling back if they're a true son and daughter of God they will but this isn't our agenda we're not interested in throwing people out this is an instruction to how to deal with sin in the church and every true son and daughter of God will reconcile and when a son and daughter sins which how many of us don't sin right every one of us does a provision for us when we do sin all we do is repent we make it right it's all we have to do so I don't want to get too far into that we know the next you know after it that that part of Matthew chapter 18 says verily it's Verse 18 verily I say unto you whatsoever you're bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven if it were two or three are gathered together in my name there I am in the midst of them that's why we gather together in church that's why we gather together and have prayer meetings because we want to ask our petitions together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we want to see the Lord move in our lives we want to see the Lord help us in our time of need but really where I want to get to brothers and sisters is verse 21 I want to read this story this morning and and we'll just start with verse 21 here then came Peter to him and said Lord how oft shall my brothers sin against me and I forgive him until seven times Jesus saith unto him I say not unto thee until seven times but until Seventy Times Seven so I kind of threw it out there last time and it just really inspired me to to think about it so I did a little a little figuring and maybe I'm wrong but I don't know I think I probably got it right so 70 times 7 is 490 times I know brother Ken preached this a long time ago and I think it's good just to stir up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance I I believe there's some people here that maybe haven't heard this before and you know so if you take 490 times and you divide it by 24 hours that equals 20.41 times in an hour a brother or sister can sin and you can still forgive them according to the word of God according to what Jesus said but you know we live in a real world we're not awake 24 hours a day are we we're not up 24 hours a day really typically if it were possible I think we would all like to sleep a minimum of eight hours some of us sleep less but if you just said eight there's still 16 hours left to wake so if you take 490 and divide that by 16 where you're awake that's 30.62 times an hour someone can come and step on your toes and and will you forgive them of course to think about that though God knew all this math like it's just it's probably given him a headache to hear me talk about this but for me I'm thinking wow when I look at this 30.62 times that's over 30 and a half times an hour someone can come and step on your toes someone can come and sin right against you and still you'll forgive them and you know there's some times where people one thing happens to them one time many years ago and they're still dragging it around 30 years later they're still bringing it to the surface and saying but you know really you don't know how bad that was you you weren't there I I was there that happened to me and you don't know how badly I was hurt but if you did deal with it according to the word of God you would just let it go and it would be there right so if you take it and go a little bit further 60 minutes in an hour divided by 30.62 that's point five one times a minute can you imagine that half an offense every single minute every every single minute of the day someone's bringing half of an offense every time you're awake but you're still supposed to forgive them still supposed to forgive them the point I believe that brother Ken brought out and that I want to get to today is that it doesn't matter how many times this shows that it's an impossibility to ever be able to not forgive somebody and think about it if this is what God is saying to us through Jesus Christ how ought we to behave when we have who the spirit of who living out through us the spirit of Christ Living in our very bodies in that little teeny spot that we heard about in in the heart of man that's not in any other creature in this Earth so that he himself who created that spot can come and take up the Abode in that spot we call it the throne in the heart of man how much more are we to be forgiven people we know the the story here let's let's just go on and read this here what what Jesus says he tells a story a parable verse 23 of Matthew 18. therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven likened unto a certain King which would take account of his servants and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents my Bible says that's 52 million dollars 52 million 800 if silver that's a lot of money am I reading that right I am 52 million almost 53 million dollars if silver goodness verse 25. so this King he recognized going through and checking everyone oh this one guy is really out of order we need to go and talk to him verse 25 but for as much as he had not to pay his Lord commanded him to be sold his wife and his children and all that he had and payment to be made and we know that that probably wouldn't be anywhere near enough verse 26 the servant therefore did what he fell down and worshiped him saying Lord have patience with me and I will pay thee all then the Lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt how many of us would forgive 53 million dollar debt that's I don't know would we be able to do that say don't worry about it it's only 53 million bucks it's all good we're brothers right but that's what it should be we know we've heard the prophet say we should be able to come to the place where we can chew each other's gum I don't know about that but I believe I'll just close my eyes maybe and hopefully get it when it's fresh oh man but the same servant verse 28 went out and found one of his fellow servants which owed him a hundred Pence you know my Bible says 44 dollars forty four dollars you know the word of God says that will strain at a gnat in our brother's eye oh my but we've got a beam in our own eye help us Lord but the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants which owed him forty four dollars and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat whose Spirit are we talking about here took him by the throat saying pay me that thou oest and his fellow servant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and I will repay thee all exactly what this fella did with a bigger debt and he would not but he went and cast him into prison until he should pay the debt teach him a lesson so when this fellow servants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done that is Lord after he had called him said unto him oh thou Wicked servant I forgave thee all that debt 53 54 million dollars but because thou desirest me I did it should us not thou have also had compassion on thy fellow servant even as I had pity on thee and his Lord was Wrath and delivered him unto the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you and this is the thing he's not talking about debt here it's not talking about money so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespass I don't think that leaves a lot of room now I want to say this we're humans I'm human we get hurt people step on our toes and I'm saying that Loosely people really wound us people really hurt us and it's up to us to forgive them because if we don't forgive them from our hearts and what that means is not saying you know I'll just tuck it under the blood and I know it's all fine everything is good you've got to genuinely come to the place where you know you have forgiven and how will you know when you've forgiven I'll Tell You by experience some people might want to contest it and dispute it but I'll tell you from experience how you will know you have forgiven them you'll forget about it there will be times where you'll remember something will come up and you'll be like oh yeah you know I used to be mad about that but I'm not anymore praise the Lord isn't it wonderful how he delivers us but as long as we're saying oh I'm upset um I'm coming to church and I'm just going to be upset and I'm going to pretend that everything's fine but everyone around can see that we're not happy we don't hide it but when we have those things brothers and sisters and maybe we do hide it and nobody can see it God sees it God sees it and as long as we're actually holding on to it we're disobeying God it's Disobedience to hold on to it because his word says that if you don't forgive from your heart you know what we want to see him take our sin and forget about it don't we how often should our brother be able to sin against us oh my and we offer forgiveness freely just freely forgiveness here you go I know you did that and I know you probably didn't mean to because I know that who I'm looking at isn't the real you and you're not looking at the real me so that when I offend you I'm potentially offending the Lord Jesus Christ if you've got the holy ghost in your life and if I don't actually ask you to forgive who am I what's gonna happen I just think it's amazing here to think that he said so likewise shall my heavenly father do unto you if you eat from your hearts do not forgive one of his brother the trespasses and and I like the way he says that because remember the main debt that was forgiven by the Lord was huge humongous a fortune and yet the other person this is the comparison that Jesus is giving in his comparison the other thing is just a teeny little thing 44 bucks isn't it interesting how it goes you look at the world it's the world we live in today people will get so upset in traffic and how meaningful is traffic when we're just driving from A to B we're going to go from here to there but sometimes there's such anger such hatred Rises up oh man that guy cut you off I've got to make sure that he can't get past me oh where does that come from brothers and sisters we got to recognize that's the spirit of the devil you know we could find ourselves in a situation that we can't go back on very easily if that situation actually begins to really unfold and manifest but remember he forgave the e so how many people can we forgive you know we can look at forgiveness I didn't even think about this being the Forgiveness message but you know what it is because if we forgive people what it does is it gives us Liberty ourselves we can look at it from a selfish perspective many people will say that as a psychological thing if you forgive people it's not different it's not for them and sometimes it's not but it's for you it gives you the Liberty to say Lord I've taken you at your word and I don't understand the circumstance I don't understand the situation but I know you've got all things under your control and I just committed unto you and trust that it will be for your glory in this situation and if I feel that brother has done wrong or that sister has done wrong and something needs to happen then it's up to you God to deal with it because all I can do is come according to your word and just forgive them freely it costs a lot it's not that easy to do but I just want to think about this and and talk about it this way just in a simple sort of a way brothers and sisters if we're dealing with situations in our lives and we have the spirit of Cain it's the wrong spirit if there's any element of Cain there in the way that we're delivering our our Behavior to the world around us to our family members to our friends to our co-workers if that spirit's there it's not the right spirit and just ask the Lord if you don't want to have the wrong Spirit just ask him to take it out of you and I guarantee you if you come with a genuine heart you'll take it out of you and I guarantee you you'll be able to come to the place one day where you'll be able to say that I've taken those hurts and I've thrown them into the sea of God's forgetfulness I've committed them unto God and because I've done that I have complete Liberty I don't walk around every day thinking about how I've been hurt how I've been wronged how this person how that person should have could have or would have it's got nothing to do with it man I'm the one with my life I'm serving God I'm praising the Lord you know when you hold a grudge probably all heard it said but I think it's just real good I'm going to say it now it's it's just like taking poison ourselves and saying I'm going to take that poison and wait for that person to get sick and wait for that person to get dead you know what's going to happen is that person's just going to carry on living their life they're just going to carry on being happy being who they are doing what they do and maybe they're just going to carry on doing wrong they're going to keep stumbling around and hurting people maybe that's gonna happen but that's not up to you to sort out it's up to us to just come in line with the word of God for our day and as long as we're willing to do that then we're not drinking the poison I think it's terrible to drink that poison I've done it I think it takes years off your life there's times where we can get to the place brothers and sisters where we can actually Lament to have a brother or a sister phone us we see their phone we see them calling us and there's something that just burns inside of us and we're like oh not again it's not the right spirit but I can tell you God will take that away if you want them to the only way he'll do it is you've got to say Lord first forgive me Lord I want to be right with you just forgive me Lord for dragging that around take that out of my life Lord and I can promise you it will take away headaches it will take away sleepless nights it will take away indigestion it will give you your joy you will be happier I don't know why I'm going this way but I can just say I've experienced it brothers and sisters it's possible and how will you know when you've forgiven I'll say it again you won't be dragging it around thinking about it one day you'll look back and think my goodness I used to be so mad about such a stupid thing or maybe that thing really did hurt me but I know it wasn't them it was the devil it was Cain spirit in that person that actually caused them to do it but it was only so that God could prove that I'm truly a son or daughter of God and I have the ability to forgive not me on my own but his spirit that liveth out through me he's the one that can give me the ability to do that it's beautiful he wants us to forgive and if we're not willing to forgive then he's not it's that simple that's really heavy but it's true if we believe his word to be true brothers and sisters he says it really plainly if you don't forgive those forty four dollar debts if you're not willing to do that and why I'm willing to forgive a 53 million dollar debt just like that because you actually had the right approach but we're not willing to forgive a 44 debt oh my that chump change is going to take our soul and chain it it's going to chain it down we need to make sure that we're willing to forgive freely from our hearts to cast it into the sea of God's forgetfulness how do you do that you just ask God to take it out of you ask God to take it from you forgive that brother that sister earnestly in your hearts freely forgive from your heart and say Lord I don't even know how to deal with it just take it out of me I know you do I promise you he will he will totally take it out in such a way that you will be uh you won't even believe it one day you'll look back and think my goodness it's just like having an addiction it's just like having something that you just can't get Beyond something in your life maybe this thing just drags around for years and years and years but one day something happens one day you look back in your life and you say didn't I have that thing wasn't there that thing chasing me my whole entire life and now I can just say I've got the Glorious Liberty of Freedom it doesn't bother me anymore you forget about it he wants us to forget about it he doesn't want us to talk about it he doesn't want us to think about it but remember Satan's going to come around and say who am I brother don't you remember don't you remember that time that place remember how it made you feel what do you think you could say to that person now what would you say to them oh I bet you could straighten them out real good now especially according to the word you probably have some extra quotes that you could bring you could really lay it in there and just bring it on them and really convict that person couldn't you that's the voice of Cain that's the devil coming around trying to remind us but we just need to say Satan here's both barrels the Old Testament and the New Testament get lost he's going to come and try and Roost in your nest in your tree I mean make a nest but you don't have to let them be there you know my dad's Farm they have they have magpies and how do they get rid of the magpies the magpies come around the springtime and they try and nest in the caraganas here's a 12 gauge shotgun and some ear protection and a box of shells go get rid of those nests that they're building and you just have to do it two or three times do the circuit two or three times and they'll go but you know what happens a little bit later on they still come back they just keep coming back those birds are Relentless and the devils are the same way they're Relentless they will continually keep coming back but the Son and Daughter of God's gonna just pull out that shotgun and say get out of here I rebuke you with this 12 gauge shell and you know what happens when you hit one of those nests with that gun it just vaporizes it literally turns to powder when you hit it with that gun and you know what we don't we don't have to let the devil come and Roost in our heads in our minds and Tangle up our minds and occupy our thoughts and take us from being productive members of our family and and being in our relationships as husbands and wives because we've got these complexes that are continually dragging us down committed unto the Lord say Lord if you're God take this complex from me in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke that devil and see if he won't leave see if God won't come on the scene he's just waiting for us to say Lord I want you to do this brother Bradham says somewhere in the message he's a thousand times more willing to do it than we are to receive it 1960-0925 that day on Calvary paragraph 127. it says now watch Jesus said watch how he stated it The Works that I'm doing now Healing The Sick raising the dead opening the eyes of the blind these Works shall you do also you'll do these if you believe in me you do these works and a greater than this shall you do for I go to my father paragraph 128. a little while and the world won't see me no more yet you'll see me I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world I will not leave you comfortless I'll pray the father he'll send you another comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the world cannot receive yet you can receive him just to think about that you can receive him and brothers and sisters when you can receive him but Branham says it in the church age book that why when you take the word of God the pure word of God for your day and and you actually speak it he says why that's deity speaking 129 now notice the Greater Works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick of by prayer cast out Devils by prayer I love this but to impart eternal life to the Believers and you know brothers and sisters I just think this is really where I want to get to today that's the purpose of getting together in church that's the purpose of believing the message of the hour it's so that we can have eternal life imparted to us but that we can forgive others so that we can impart eternal life to them because maybe some people just can't have the Liberty that we have but if we have the ability to say I just freely forgive you according to the word of God just the way that Jesus instructed his disciples uh just exactly according to that Parable I don't understand it necessarily but that Spirit that's inside of me oh my goodness there's a blood that cryeth out and it just has Mercy for all those people that will come and I'm just willing to take him at his word and just forgive so freely my goodness I feel like according to what brother Mervin said someone's going to come and step on my feet remember brother Mervin when he brought that message I can't remember all of them but he said if you want patience you're going to get trials you pray for patience and watch what happens I'm saying I'm praying for forgiveness Lord have mercy now notice paragraph 129 the Greater Works was to have power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to the Believers the Holy Ghost was coming and giving into the hands of the church to impart life oh that's what Calvary meant it took stoked degraded men and women and lifted them into a place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick and to impart eternal life I just when I read this I say my goodness isn't it so so easy to see why Satan doesn't like this isn't it so easy to see why the religious people would be the ones that would come right against the word that William Mary and Branham brought because he wasn't bringing some sort of false Doctrine he's bringing the truth how can you say that this is wrong that this is false Doctrine he's talking about Sons and Daughters of God people coming to the full realization of who they are about what the word of God is for to bring and impart eternal life to the believer that's what Calvary meant it took it stooped degraded men and women lifted them into a place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick and to impart eternal life brothers and sisters that's the key I believe that's the critical Factor that's why we're here to impart eternal life to bring it to our children to bring it to our spouses to bring it to our parents to bring it to our neighbors to bring it to our co-workers to our bosses oh my to our schools whoever wherever just to impart eternal life and sometimes as we live our lives maybe we'll have to say a few words but most times we'll just have to live our lives our lives will speak volumes but to impart life not to impart judgment and unforgiveness judgment and unforgiveness brothers and sisters I'm sorry that's that's the wrong spirit it's not right I love the way that he says this too lifted them into the place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick so you know what we're not just looking for Healing The Sick are we we're not just looking for signs and wonders not looking for people to speak in tongues to say that they've got it we're not looking for limbs to be restored to say that they've got it to be able to speak squirrels into existence to be able to speak food into existence we're not looking for any of that we're just simply looking to impart eternal life because we want internal life imparted to us and as we're willing to actually forgive then we'll be forgiven as we're willing to judge then we will be judged there's coming a time I believe it with all my heart and I'm sure that we've all experienced it I think you could probably say Amen to it if you have but you know brothers and sisters we know this third pole Ministry it's not a public show we're not looking for great ministry to say that Calgary living words got the move of the Holy Spirit just like what was it was it Ashbury Tennessee people would say oh my we got to go and experience that and see it and you know sure there's an anointing with that but can they take the word are there people there fully forgiving everyone freely I don't know I'm not going to judge them and say no but I'm going to say do they believe the prophet do they believe the word sent by a Vindicated Prophet the one that said thus saith the Lord for this age because if they don't I don't know what are they doing we know that there will be many people in this world that will have great signs and wonders they're not what we're after that's not what we're looking for but I was saying it a little couple minutes earlier and I just get sidetracked but you know I can I'm sure that every one of us will be able to say I have experienced the third pull in my own life I have experienced speaking the word and watching it come to manifest right before my very eyes if you've experienced that say Amen this morning it's not a public show and you know as times get tougher brothers and sisters testimonies are going to get greater and greater maybe they will stop the ability to go and get groceries maybe they will stop the ability to go and get gasoline in our cars maybe they will stop some of these things to happen but you watch the true Sons and Daughters of God then when we need to go and be in service for the king Watch What Happens there will be a book of Acts written behind us but what we're talking about is imparting life forgiving freely I think it's just so beautiful brother Branham says oh my we'll just carry on a place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient believers men who are once unbelievers be made Believers and impart spiritual eternal life 130 how much greater is it to say this sick woman laying here I can pray a prayer of faith and shall be healed that's a great thing that's what he was doing then but said greater than this shall you do I'm going to give you power not only to raise up for a while but to give him eternal life which will be Eternal forever how much greater is it brothers and sisters that's what we're talking about is to see the souls saved to see people come according to the word of God to truly get baptized with the Holy Ghost and I'll say it I don't know if if brother Doty has ever heard it said before but I'll say it I'm sure you must have there's times where you can get the Holy Ghost before you even hit water because what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost is the ability to receive the word for your day and you know the truth of the matter is when you receive the word for your day you're going to live it yeah you're not just gonna say I believe it I receive it you're going to live it because when you've received it it becomes a part of you and when it becomes a part of you you have to express it you cannot express it because that's the life that's inside of you every seed will bring forth after his own kind the only thing we've got to do is just pour on that word just stay straight with the word just like the prophet said I think it's so beautiful like Andrew Glover said I'll just keep saying this you know what if we want to say something fantastic and new we're just going to say what the prophet said because that is fantastic and new most people aren't even talking about it anymore they're trying to put some kind of a spin on it and you know what it is brothers and sisters it's because they're just not sufficiently impressed with the word but how many people here today are sufficiently impressed with the word if we can say that we're sufficiently impressed with the word oh my then there ain't no devil in hell or on Earth it can stand in your way brothers and sisters [Music] not one greater than this shall you do I'm going to give you power not only to raise them up for a while but to give him eternal life which will be Eternal forever you know how brother Bradham he had the healing lines and the and the major campaigns and and the many mighty services and tremendous healings that went on but how many of those people actually truly went on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's many signs and wonders many people were healed but many people died and we know that you you had to confess your sin before you went before the prophet I remember hearing about this this guy this man and I thought boy oh boy if he could discern the thoughts that were in the heart of a man thinking that it was actually a man that was Discerning the thoughts that were in the heart of a man thinking about it carnally knocking at the surface not realizing what's actually happening you know what it did for me it caused me to be afraid I had fear because it was something that I didn't know it was something undefinable to me it was something that was out there and and the thing about it is I knew that I had sin I had things hidden in my life and that that man would expose it and I wouldn't be able to hide from it if it's true what was being said about this man but you know it goes deeper than that it wasn't a man because no man can do that only God can do that we know Satan can impersonate it but only God can do it consistently effectively over and over and over and never make a mistake with it and many people will say oh I'm sure that the prophet made mistakes not in discernment he was a man but never one time was he off with the discernment maybe he did things I'm not here to say criticize him I'm not interested in that what I am interested in is saying that there was a Vindicated prophet in our age and he was able to bring a word that brought us to the place where we can be positionally placed as Sons and Daughters of God where we can heal the sick where we can have the prayer of faith and the sick will be raised up but more importantly than that we will have the word out front of us and we'll see people have eternal life imparted to them where they can truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when they do get the baptism of the Holy Ghost whether it's before they hit water or whether it's after they hit water or whether it's during the time they're underwater it doesn't matter when they get the baptism of the Holy Ghost they're sealed until the day of their Redemption it's not until tomorrow when you fall and become human being again and you get away from the church experience it's not about that at all it's about receiving the word for your day and when you do nothing can change it because nobody ever talked you into it it's a beautiful thing when you get that baptism of the Holy Ghost that day on Calvary paragraph 131 same message zero nine two five poor blind wretched people how do you miss that don't you see what the greater thing is that's the greatest thing ever could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others can a man do that Son of God can yeah isn't it wonderful how did people get saved in the Bible after Jesus went up on a cloud after he was taken up into heaven and those two angels were standing there saying you know ye men of Galilee what are you looking at what are you doing here go on get busy go and do your thing go into Jerusalem and tell people about this go go and spread the gospel it has to be men telling men God uses men sons of God can impart eternal life we got into this last time I'm I'm running out of time here I'm not even really getting into it again but we'll get there I'm just going to touch on it paragraph 132 Jesus said who's so ever sins you remit to them they are remitted whosoever sin ye retain to them they are retained now here is where the Catholic church and many others made their big mistake they go out and say I forgive your sins that wasn't it how did they get sins forgiven in the Bible Peter answered that question on the day of Pentecost they said what can we do to be saved how can we get this that you all got he laid down the prescription he told them what to do he said repent every one of you towards God and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what for for the remission of your sin there's the Greater Works and there's the Greater Works what a man is willing to lay down his pride and lay down his life and say I want to be baptized and I want to say maybe I don't understand this titles thing and and maybe the name of Jesus Christ thing maybe I don't completely understand it but I just know the word of God says it so I want to see if God will be God and make it real to me in my life and the reason I say that brothers and sisters is I did that I did that exact thing I didn't come and and have a counseling session with the pastor to say that you know have you read this scripture and have you read this quote and have you read this scripture and have you read this quote and and have you been in the church X number of days and and have you done this and should have you have done that there was none of that it was through a conversation that the word of God says that you should be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and I thought wow I was baptized in the name of the father but what name is that I don't know what I'm saying is that sometimes we can make get so balled up in the doctrine of things and miss the main point the main point is we want to see people get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and if we're willing to come according to say Saint Peter's prescription here then we're going to actually get the right results then we truly will get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know we were talking about a little bit you know brother Branham says it uh people have been concerned about children getting baptized and sometimes children will do it because other children want to do it but you know the children want to do it let them do it brother Bradham says they may never ask again and who will be accountable for that I wouldn't want to be that person to say my son wanted to get baptized but I thought he should reach at least this certain age and this certain Milestone and have this certain way what if it's just God in the heart of the child saying get me baptized because I know that I can get the baptism of the Holy Ghost or maybe I've already got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I just want to come according to what the scripture says that it behooves all scripture to fulfill all scripture I got that wrong but we have to come according to the scripture and just get baptized in water it's possible to receive the Holy Ghost before you do just look at the story of Cornelius him and his house they got baptized after they received the gift of the Holy Ghost I just want to say don't get balled up in Doctrine and dogmone ideas and theories just get the Holy Ghost get to know the author of this book personally let him reveal it to you personally come according to his word and ask him to reveal it to me personally so that not so that I can just have eternal life so that I can have it imparted to me so that I could impart it to other people my neighbor might be struggling with something and just by being there at the right time there could be a word fitly spoken that would change his life forever paragraph 135 he said repent every one of you towards God and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for what for for the remission of your sin there's the greater work how many you preachers this morning how many you listening to my word on Magnetic Tape I just love that are willing to go to Calvary this morning and look what God did there for you and forsake your denominational Creeds and preach the gospel hallelujah it's in your lap now what are you going to do with it for repentance and remission of sins must be preached in his name to all the world beginning at Jerusalem Hallelujah Glory there you are what does Calvary mean to you what did that day do to you and I want to say this morning Calgary Living Word what did that day do to you what did it do to us did it stuff you out with some theology did it make you a stuffed shirt or did it make you a Christian sold out Hallelujah did it take us and pop us up because if we're getting puffed up for any reason brothers and sisters it's a wrong spirit that's Cain spirit I'm Not My Brother's Keeper no I don't have to worry about him no that's the wrong Spirit we don't want to have that in our lives don't want to have it in our homes we don't have it around our families I think one of the most important things for our family is to have a daddy that is willing to be humble enough to ask for forgiveness I believe that will make all the difference in the world in a home to have a daddy that will say I did wrong and I know it will you forgive me but when you get a daddy that will say nope I never did wrong I'm the daddy everything I do is right it's going to cause dissension we just need to forgive each other brothers and sisters not because somebody says so because our hearts are very hearts desire to and what that is is eternal life that we're imparting to others 19620318 spoken word is the Original Seed Saint John chapter 20. I believe that's what I got marked down here and beginning with the 19th verse now listen close I challenge you to believe it oh I just feel good oh if I just wish I could see the Holy Spirit just huddle over here like that say now it's me listen can you imagine that push aside William Mary and Branham push aside Barry Bush aside all the humanity and just say just speak to me Holy Spirit just let it be you speaking to me I believe he will I challenge you to believe it oh I just I it feel good I just wish I could see the Holy Spirit just huddle over here like that say now listen the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for the fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and said unto them peace be unto you and when he had said so he showed unto them his hands and his side when his disciples let's see his side and and when there were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord when they recognized him remember they were upside down they were living in fear they were hiding their best friend the teacher and Rabbi he was killed even though he preached the word to them they were frightened they were hiding and rightfully so they probably would have been thrashed too if they were identified as one of his followers then said Jesus unto them peace be unto you oh are you ready as my father hath sent me he's the word the seed word seed so send I you I think it's a beautiful thing to hear Amen to that because many people would say oh it's just the disciples he's just talking to the disciples he's not he's speaking to Sons and Daughters of God the True Believers are the ones that are going to say Amen to that he says you believe it don't stop there's more of it and when they had said this he breathed on them and said unto them received ye the Holy Ghost whosoever sins you remit to them they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained is that the truth I just want to take that scripture pause for a second as we I guess we pretty much need to get ready to close maybe I'll call the musicians and we'll pick this up later I guess but to think about this whosoever sins you remit they shall be remitted but whoever sins you don't remit they shall be kept they'll be retained is what the word says which is kept held onto when somebody sins against you remember the scripture that we read in Matthew 18 then came Peter unto him and said Lord how oft shall my brother sin against me how often shall he sin against me we went through the math we know there's way more times than we could ever possibly keep on top of it's just impossible for a brother to sin more times than we have forgiveness for if we're truly Sons and Daughters of God but if we don't actually have that forgiveness if we just can't come up without forgiveness then there's something wrong because honestly brothers and sisters it's not even us forgiving it's the spirit of Christ inside of us forgiving so if whoever sins you hold on to they're the sins that you're going to keep because the way that you judge people is the way that you'll be judged it's pretty heavy but it's important for us to recognize we're all living in this Human Condition and we're going to have our our feet stepped on we're going to have all these problems but you know I don't even know if it's in this quote I might not even finish reading this quote here but I just think when we think about how our brother our sister could could do things to us how much more did Jesus have things done to him the one that was actually hit in the head the one that was spit on had a crown of thorns pounded onto his head was thrown to the ground was forced to crawl up the street bloody almost dead but he wouldn't give up he hauled that cross why did he haul it so that we could have that in impartment of internal life that eternal life could come to us and we would want to hold something against a brother or a sister bye we did nothing to Jesus did we and he still went to Calvary for us maybe stand with me as we close today brothers and sisters forgive freely and I'll say this if you forgive freely not just that Jesus will actually forgive you because he will but I think we've gone well beyond that in terms of where we are in the sands of time understanding the church ages and all we know about the word for our day if we're not willing to forgive then I don't think we have the spirit of Christ wow that's good really hard but I want to say it plain and clear Cain's spirit will manifest Cain's Spirit the spirit of Christ will manifest the spirit of Christ you can't say that I'm going to live my life according to Cain's spirit and demonstrate this way and go to church and say praise the Lord I'm saved Hallelujah I got the Holy Ghost you might have an anointing we want to see people have eternal life imparted to them we want to see people know that they know that they know exactly where they stand I just can't can't express it the way I believe the Lord has given it to me but brothers and sisters just forgive just be willing to forgive freely that will demonstrate the life that's inside of you and you know if you've held on to things let him go you don't want nothing to hold you down we were hiking the other day and I just was finding all these really interesting rocks really really interesting rocks and it wasn't before long that I thought you know if I keep picking up rocks I'm not going to be able to carry them and I just I just thought in the moment you know isn't that a little bit like our lives and our burdens we can just keep picking up things we're supposed to lay them down don't pick them up and carry them with you they'll drag you down brothers and sisters just forgive freely and God will forgive you let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we love you and we thank you for your word and father we thank you for your forgiveness Lord for your willingness to impart eternal life unto us whether we can look at the signs and the Wonders and all the Mysteries and all the things but father help us to get the ABCs right down pat Lord Jesus help us to understand oh Father there's no way that you're going to forgive us if we're willing to hold on to stuff in our lives while there may be there's unbelievers that have hurt us so deeply and father even worse maybe there's Believers that have help us to deal with them according to your word father you've given us a provision now it's up to us it behooves us to come according to your word father I pray that you would just Lord continue to impart eternal life father Lord even though the hour is late even though the Rapture is near father we know you're still calling and I pray that Lord we could just father plead for those people that we love and lot because we want to see them conform but Lord that we could just extend Grace unto them knowing that you have it all in control and you're just looking for our response our response will either attract or detract people to your kingdom father we love you and we thank you
