========================================

I just want to use this opportunity to appreciate God for helping me. I'm officially done with college and even though when I felt like I was about to be a failure, God saw me too. [Music] [Music] Lord. Glory, glory, glory to the lamb. [Music] Glory, glory, glory to thee. For you are glorious and worthy to be praised. You are the lamb upon the throne [Music] and onto you. I lift my voice in praise. You are living upon the throne. [Music] Glory, glory, glory to the lamb. Glory, glory, glory to the lamb. For you are glorious and worthy to be praised. You are the lamb upon the throne and to I lift my voice in praise. You are the lamb upon the throne. Glorious and worthy to be praised. You are the lamb upon the throne and unto you. I lift my voice to praise. You are the lamb upon the throne. You are the lamb upon the throne. You are the lamb upon the throne. Hallelujah. [Applause]
