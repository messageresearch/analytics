better to get home home is where our heart truly is I bring you greetings from Saskatoon Tabernacle and everyone that was there brother Dwayne fair I know that brother Mena was here and he offered greetings and uh yeah it was just a wonderful time last Wednesday at Saskatoon Tabernacle and uh straight away after service we began the journey we drove for two hours North and began the whole entire thing but we're certainly thankful to be here tonight we have uh just one prayer request we wanted to bring before the church I certainly want to thank everyone as well for your prayers for my nephew Zachary um certainly difficult many times in life we don't understand why the Lord allows things the way he allows them oh we know that's his perfect will nothing happens unless he first allows it to happen and for my mother to be allowed to have muscular dystrophy for my sister to be allowed to have Muscular Dystrophy and my nephew to be allowed to have muscular dystrophy how is that how does it happen it's the Lord's will not for us to be sick his will is that we would be well that we would prosper and be in good health but we know it's for a purpose and I just want to thank everyone for your prayers he's back home from the hospital he had a broken femur and was in tremendous amounts of pain and now they're trying to manage phlegm from becoming pneumonia there's all the doctor's terminology but we know the great physician and tonight I just want to ask that we could just one more time intercede for Zach at home with his family they're under great pressure tremendous pressure trying to care for their son it's more than they can bear but they're doing their very best and if you can just remember a special request for his daddy Brad you know many times in this world men can just leave relationships because they don't go the way they want but this man has been a soldier he has stood firm in his position as the dad and he is not backed down not one bit from caring for his wife or his son I believe that man is a champion and if you could just thank the Lord for Brad nadarach you have a need tonight let's just go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful for your goodness tonight we heard about it and we sang it father and Lord I believe it was more than just lips from her lungs it was truly from our hearts Lord not from our hearts but from the heart that you put inside of us father your word says that you'll take out the Stony heart and you'll replace it with a flesh a heart of Flesh Lord and we know that it's not even our flesh it's yours father and tonight we're so thankful for your goodness to us Lord one more time to be able to gather together in your name in your presence father Lord we just want to remember every uplift hand

hour and understand that you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord father we thank you for the testimony Lord we thank you for each member of the family Lord and we know that it's for your

bless Kelly Lord and that you would just uplift Brad father that he would just have a supernatural encouragement in his life father that maybe he wouldn't even understand what it is Lord oh but father one day maybe he would understand the prayers of the Saints father will be careful to give you the praise oh Father we just invite you to have your will in your way in this service one more time

then that's very good okay we can now stand up so standing all right brother yeah yeah thank you thank you so standing up like that we shall turn to our Bibles and read from the book of Matthew chapter 10 it will be good for us to read three scriptures so that well I I will be Matthew chapter 10 Matthew chapter 10 let's read verse 40 uh one he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet he shall receive a prophet is a reward and he that receiveth the righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man is reward then the book of uh Romans chapter 10 verse 14 and 15. how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed the how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher the rest we shall read after we have sat down there our heavenly father I won't raise up a prayer after reading this scripture here that father Lord God you may open up the inner mind about this message that I'm about to preach further that it may come and a view of great impact to our souls our bodies and our spirits bless the whole congregation and take me out of the way just use my voice and use my lips because I am thine I am yours father forgive me in anything that may be contrary but rather take up stand with your word as a promise speak to us then we shall say you have been with us in Jesus name Lord we pray amen we may be seated okay now our subject tonight says line up accurately to receive a promissory word line up accurately to receive a prophetess I mean a prophet is reward you have to line up accurately you need not to be crooked you need to be in line how is it going to happen just pay attention that we may look into this holy scriptures ah our Lord Jesus Christ is the one who spoke and I said he that receives a prophet he that receives a prophet in ah the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and I he that receives the righteous man in the name of our Testament shall receiver a testament his reward so how do we line up how do we line up and I get this reward we have some of us not all of us some of us in this world as it is wide we have been going crooked leaving the line and then we miss the reward but I already said he who will receive so you can put yourself in that place oh whoever I know you have a name here you may be Patrick you may be Sister Lisa you can't be there maybe I can use Paul and others oh whoever then you put yourself there wherever and I say that is in me uh-huh then we can put whoever receive a prophet okay then we can also add a prophet to be number two that's right then also uh we add that one who promised who said whoever was that one saying that was our Lord Jesus Christ so we find that there are three now so it's Jesus Christ who commanded and we are going to start with him because he is a perfect person in him there is no any Rebellion in him there is no any guile in him there's no any spot in him there is no any stain there is no any question mark that we can question he is ever omnipotent omnisayan he is perfect so we have got him now we need the two who are remaining the two are remaining must also line up so that we get a reward now Edward is our promise what is a reward any word is anything that you lack in your life whether you need it it is a need it's not a demand any word is in it even going to raptures in it because some people say I wish I get out of here I am tired of this I'm tired of this so you have a need you need a proper place you need another good body you need that everything so we find out that any word comes after the three have lined up accurately now we have found that God has never changed he is always perfect so now he needs also he needs a proper prophet he needs someone then we see here in the Bible that God arrangs everything because when we read the book of uh of romanism he said like this it was Roman 4 10 14. how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed who are these These are the Believers now how can they call on Jesus how can they call on God how can they believe in him because there's no one who revealed God to them no one who has preached to them so what God does first of all he prepares a prophet he arrangs someone remember we are learning with the prophet but the scripture talked about too a prophet and a righteous man but let's go with the prophet first of all so it is God who prepares a prophet and when he prepares him then that's number two then number three he prepares those who can receive a prophet yes yes then he says how can they the Believers how can they know God how can they trust God how can they call god without a preacher or without a prophet so God prepares this prophet then the Bible says that um and how shall they preach except they be sent now it's good again who sense these preachers who sends these Prophets he is the one who sends them now after we have got that clear picture we shall go to the book of uh of First Kings chapter 17 to find out a guru example then we shall discover that if we can keep on lining up because I remember in the message there's somewhere where brother Branham saw in the end of time when some The Pride some members of the Bride group were deviating out of the line then he said stay in the line that's right so we can now go and find out a good example is in the book of First Kings chapter 17 if you will start from uh chapter 17 if you can start from verse 2 says and the word of the Lord came unto him this is Elijah now and the word of the Lord he came unto him saying that is before Jordan and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the Brook and I have Commit commanded the robins to feed everywhere so he went and did according unto the word of the Lord for he went and dwelt by the Brook Terrace that's before Jordan here is Elijah God is sending him he is preparing him he is equipping him to make him be of great value to someone to a receiver so then we find out that God being a true God he also needs a true prophet now a true Prophet how does he become a true Prophet God always walks on him to start what we call an obedient Foundation to be started it's like borrow said I have laid the foundation but whoever builds son let him be careful you see now here God takes a prophet Prophet Elijah and I sense him to the river he did not send him to a certain mansion or anything but that's a river whereby if you see the circumstances of the river what things stay by the river you you will wander by the river snakes tortoise ah maybe even some spiders mosquitos and so on and to Adam he also said I have commanded the Revenant not doves because people they keep dancing their homes they are good birds and so on they cooperate but okay sir I've never in America he is it Canada they love they love what they call pets and so on but I don't see people keeping grabbing each other they are pets and whatever because the way how the rabbits behave they eat from garbage and one of them has a bad history in the time of Noah when Noah said to one of them it never came back so it had a bad history and this is a thing that God is telling he's a prophet I have commanded them he did not say maybe no he said I would redirect it it cannot change it has been done by me and I am a true God what you do is to follow my instructions I have commanded I have done it already amen so here we don't find any answering we don't find any why and how we don't find those kind of fuming or grumbling no the Bible has told us in in verse 5 so he went and did according to the word of God you see such kind of a foundation that God is laying you'll see such kind of obedience you see when God wants to use something he prepares it he cleanses it he makes it a blessing to to a blessing to other people so in other times I would say uh God is the source of blessings God is the source of the rewards but when he's sending them he must use something so any cause to use a human being he must deal with that human being until he reaches a quality that is worthy to send the blessing to someone through that person praise the Lord yeah so therefore this is someone you know God has what we call terms under condition Sometimes some conditions that he gives you you can ask yourself why but being a creature a Creator a creature yourself you are created by Him you have nothing to ask him you just be obedient because you are just easy creation so I wonder how sometimes it doesn't like in the time of if you remember Elijah Elijah when he sent gay has to go and take the road and put on that tuna Mighty Zoo boy that him he said don't greet don't do this he gave him conditions why because he knows that God deals with good good good obedience he gives things to create and obedience in someone that's why they couldn't have gone sometimes they are tried they are tried so that God is building an obedience Foundation anywhere they were tense around they were good houses around but see how God is sailing Elijah to a river there were some people who can feed him around but see how he's saying these birds will do these parts also have their own fresh way at again when you see buzzards on the road when you see Revenue somewhere they are feeding on things that are already dead but this is what God did to Elijah why was he doing that he was preparing him to be an obedient verse so he was preparing him to be a good something that blessings can go through without any Grumble or without an obstacle praise the Lord that's what he did so therefore now we have seen God is number one omnipotent who is he perfect he has the resources of rewards blessings he wants to send them somewhere he wants to create Faith somewhere he wants to create a a good collaboration or good relationship somewhere and I uses that remember we have said in the Book of Romans that how can they call on him whom they have never known even then he prepares someone who can go and tell them so they can believe in him so now we get to we have got God now we have got Elijah okay so what is the intention the Final Destination was not reworkative but there was a woman somewhere we know very well the story where God was intending to send Elijah that this woman shall receive a reward praise the Lord any Hard Times where people were assessing famine where people were becoming so skinny because you know you eat to because to be good but when you don't eat how can you look good you eat building food then everything which makes your skin look good and I will tell everything has a purpose so maybe the the life of that woman changed and her own son was they were to die so they had an expectation that death is going to occur on us but praise the Lord life is going to occur on them [Applause] then after that after God is seeing that now Elijah is already in the line so he was looking for the third person because three is a number of perfection so he was looking for the third person to stand in the line so that His blessings goes through without any obstacle but that it might flow very smoothly that it might go where it is going then here he comes here he arrives now God tells him now you have done according to my word I want you to go somewhere that that person will also do according to your word but it's not your word it is my word praise the Lord barely hear this man of God because and when he reaches there because of his tough situation things were not good this human here the Widow she started to have some answer some reasoning capacities that she had around the atmosphere she looked at the atmosphere she said this is a trial how can you come and ask me food yet it's only our expectation for me and my son after we eat this remember that she mentioned that then we die but what Elijah did let me uh someone give me a quote of brother Branham about this woman when there's something like that reaction to an action that message book reaction to an action then she had she started to turn again under she had the voice saying but bringing me one fast what do we learn here amen okay put it there yes if it can be here where someone can see all right then she under she had a voice saying but bring me one fast you see this is now a prophet trying to correct this woman here because she was standing aside he wants her to be accurate in the line to be a true receiver because Jesus said whoever will receive our prophet so she wanted not to receive a prophet because if you don't receive a word of a prophet then we have refused to receive the prophet then here a prophet tries to correct to bring her back in the line then he said bring me one fast I'm still reading ah so what do we learn here what do we run here seek you fast the kingdom of God how will I make it I can't tell you but you put God first seek you from the kingdom of God and his righteousness all these things other things will be added okay but bring me one fast look she didn't have to go down and get her last penny she had to go down bread she didn't have to go for this all of that or maybe King doctors or so forth some retro in silicone thing but she had to go to the only thing that stood between her and the death and her child bring me a little cake fast in your hand I can see I know they are ahead obedience obedient that is what God requires you get the word under the spirit mixed together self-sacrifice obedience when God is the prophet to say the certain thing do it hold on to it that is it praise the Lord yes that's why I told you that God looks for an obedience God could create he created the manner in the wilderness he made the bread and the people ate it he couldn't do anything for Elijah to eat but he is asking for this woman bringing me fast trying to correct her and bring her in the line so when she allowed to come in the line she received a prophet's reward what happened miracles what happened and he said over death life because she didn't die she lived and what happened she became a question among the community what makes your life to change we are different we are dying but you are always so happy and so good and so heresy what makes you alive change her answer is I received a prophet [Applause] [Applause] thank you praise the Lord now maybe before we go very far if you can again also in this uh question and answers paid 101 100 1042 question and answers page 1042 it's brother Branham if you have time please explain in Matthew 10 41 the one we have been reading so bring for us that one we see what the prophet is going to talk about here I have it it's already written down here with me but we can't he says if you have time please explain imagine 10 41 I would like to know what is a prophet is the reward well now Jesus said who's ever receive a prophet in the name of our Prophet receiver Prophet is the reward a prophet is reward is to be a friend with the prophet whosoever receives the righteous man in the name of our richest man receiver that just man is the reward is that right and if they want to know what a prophet's reward is to be a friend to the prophet see that's the reward he is your friend like a mighty woman it might come in hand sometimes see it didn't with her see what he got his servants aha oh you have been following there that is right so someone asked brother brought him a question to explain where I have been reading she did that on our behalf it is like when Paul said but he must remember that in the any time perias times will come timof is not here amen so that was for us because we are the ones who are living in the end time so that question was asked on your behalf because many people would deviate from the line during the any time and we have seen it it is happening they are going astray from the line they are making it complicated to God to send his rewards his promises to let it go through and the God cannot contradict himself praise the Lord he cannot contradict his system always remains good and perfect and he wants it to run that way amen so she asked the prophet a question then he brought an example like a shunamite woman so that means it's like this becoming a friend is another level when God made Abraham to be his friend it was another level when Jesus made the disciples to be his friends it was another level so becoming a friend is a level that you have been elevated to after being tried and I have been proven to be true I must try and I was proven to be true and the god called him Abraham is my friend and can I hide him anything that I'm about to do so when we become God's friends he cannot hide anything to do he reveals everything to us because we are his friends amen so when God makes a prophet to be his friend then a prophet also says I will make more friends for you if our Prophet becomes God is a friend then we also who receives his message we become God's friends Korea praise the Lord even the Book of James he proves the same that God called Abraham his friend in the book of second Chronicles chapter 20 verse 7 the Bible says art not thou Our God who did his drive out to the inhabitants of this land before thy People Israel and I gave a city to the Seed of Abraham thy friend forever that's now uh one witness think that another witness Isaiah 41 verse 8 but thou Israel at my servant Jacob whom I have chosen the seed of Abram my friend that's another second witness another sadly Witness James chapter 2 verse 23 and the scripture was fulfilled which says Abram believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and that he was called the friend of God okay that's another level now here comes our prophet answering like that then he refers to a shuna matuma so then we go back at the sunamite woman what happened she she had no account they were getting all the stricken old no child but her advice was hey my husband we have believed in God's word we are believing God is Prophet but why can't we line up and become a friend to a prophet maybe something hard can happen maybe we can get a reward understands she lined up when she lined up because number one God is a perfect true God second his Prophet are always true Prophets then she knew that if I can line up there's nothing impossible then she made Elisha to be a friend and then she also became a friend of God can I hide can I refuse your anything since she's in the life and I can see the conduit is a perfect shoe he sent the reward to her even when they tell it again things went I tell you what we do is stay in the line praise the Lord what do we do we don't want shortcuts we can go back can we go back again in the book of First Kings chapter 17 we shall read verses 2 verse 5 and verse 15. verse 5 and verse 15. okay as we go there put that then we can see verse 5. verse 5 is going to say he went yes First Kings 17 verse 5. 17 verse 5. the Bible says so he went and I did it according unto the word of the Lord that is Elijah now let's go verse 15. this is you now whoever will receive that is you now and as she went and I did according to the saying of Elijah so you see she did not jump she followed the message Hallelujah she respected the word of God she respected the prophet of God she gave him food or not so that she cannot contradict herself she knew that as long as that word is from God she believed it she did not jump she don't call herself wise she did not blame she did not correct she did not assume she did not say ah he's a false prophet no praise the Lord that is how things must go my dear friends and the sisters we are seeing things going by Zach different in this anytime people are getting tired of waiting they are deviating from the line and then therefore when they do that they are missing their Rewards if they miss that the economists even rapture because Paul said like this in the book of Hebrews chapter 10 verse 24 35 says cast not our confidence your confidence which has agreed reward so when he says cast not away there are some things that are really threatening the bride or the Believers until they are tired they want to raise up they want to surrender don't surrender don't surrender even if you see people are going getting away they are tired but God's word is still perfect [Applause] here's the system is still the same here's the system is still very good we can't do anything outside over the system pray the Lord let's see somewhere where the Lord is again blaming he's blaming the receivers they are refusing to line up and then he's blaming them in the Book of Luke chapter 4 verse 24 let's read Luke 4 24 bring for us Luke 24 chapter 4 verse 24 he is blaming them then we shall read the verse 24 25 and 26. look okay chapter four let me see okay and I said verily I said to you no Prophet is accepted in his own country he is blaming them already he's there he wants them to line up they are not sick this is written the book of Deuteronomy you are God shall rise up a prophet like you Moses whoever will not listen to him [Music] so they don't want to listen to him he is there in the room of a prophet fulfilling the scripture but they are not listening he want to give them some memory words that's why brother Brahma said many miracles we are done by Jesus that's true many miracles would have been done by Jesus but because they did not believe in him they deviated from the line from the system goddess system is three Perfection another three is he God prophet the you all of you stand in the line amen and amen but when God sends their blessings you he sends the reward and then you you do like this then God says Ah no no how am I going to send it praise the Lord there's a prophet there's a prophet who wanted it to stand in the middle just to cut the blessings of children of Israel we call him balam he said oh then back the king of uh there was a moabs or whatever he came and I said ah I can see God he can't do anything can you come understand in the middle so that he can send the castings to devour these people away so when he came God said no since you are a prophet I will make that office at good you are self you are not good but in that office amen yeah you know pray the Lord so you cannot stray the trophies God said when you stood there and then he was ready to cast and the God said then the the the power came and he said oh no I know Israel no one he was too cast but he didn't because why because God don't want wrong things to be in that light praise the Lord okay I was saying Luke chapter 4 verse 24 here is a prophet he is a true prophet and now I want these people to stand in their life they are refusing under he wants to remind them he wants to remind them like he reminded others about Sodom and the Gomorrah when they refuse he can remind them now he wants to meet them about that woman what did she do let's read verse 25 but I tell you of the truth many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias when the heaven is worshiped up three years and the six months when great feminine was throughout all the land but unto none of them was Elias sent save unto serapita a city of sidon and to a woman that was a widow you see Jesus is reminding them and I said if you can look back you would understand what is happening right now and I would stand in the line but is reminding them their eyes were blinded they did not see even today many Pentecostals Methodist you tell them what is happening today let us stand in the line they don't see they want to jump and they say we know God they don't want the middle god is perfect three is a perfect number whoever that's you receive a prophet that's number two and then who sent who said his number so we must be three three three three three my dear brothers and the sisters therefore you are not in the wrong place you are in the right place according to the scriptures you are in the right place honored that to keep your mind in the mid uh in the life don't listen to other voices praise the Lord He also mentioned Naman let's go all these little people that they mentioned the message brought their life to a better life that woman ate that she lived is going to be let's read let's read he's reminding us uh-huh verse 26 I'm in verse 27. Adams Where in Israel in the time of Elias the prophet and none of them was clear saving Naman the Syrian you see he's also mentioning Naman the Syria Naman is a gentile we are the Gentiles we are not a Jews we are the Normans we are the Normans especially today who who cannot see when the prophet face to face a prophet speaks from inside the house you hear just The Voice so what what am I saying we go back at the store of Naman what happened from Israel God used her and she tells the mistress stress can you tell Dad tell my master that if he can you know she did not mention that but I'm the one mentioning it but it's the same thing if we can go in Israel I'd line up behind the prophet he will receive the reward amen then went then when he went he thought those things can be also bribed by money how much you have or how much gifts you have I tell you God's gift is free and that is his love so pick out the things under whatever maybe he put on his uniform with all the ranks the stars and everything and they also had to go with some escorts and so on why it's because he is a someone of a great Lanka he is visiting another Nation so he has to go with everything then he went and when he went he did not go and line up behind the prophet so he thought maybe these are political issues where they have something they can help him because uh you know in this world Kings or presidents they also seek for some assistances too so he went there and when the prophet of Israel I mean Kingdom of Israel he saw that he cried because that was another section that he cannot do those are things that pertains only with Prophets but good enough the rumors wreaked Elias and I said send him here that he may stand behind and we line up then he came so when he came what happened Eliza did not come out so that this mind can gain Faith by looking at him no amen Elise I wanted him to believe this spoken word [Applause] Hallelujah so he hid himself inside the house and I said he must believe the word and line up and I said what is he saying what is he who's that prophet and who is behind him God praise the Lord so then he came so any Rick the premise says it there and then the prophet spoke go and borrow yourself seven times into Jordan ah he said that's that's a different Doctrine amen and we don't do things like that ah then he started comparing ah we have Urban the beautiful river that we have decorated which is so beautiful it has no even crashes or maybe ah then he started comparing right you see God is things you have to follow what obedient when a prophet tells you something do it do it as he said to the shunamite woman ah so then when he was doing like that then when God looked at the line he said uh I want to heal this man but it is still outside the line and I can't I don't do shortcuts until you do what I want right but then the Bible says God we are co-workers together with him and the Bible says the common people had Jesus gladly it's because they didn't see any greatness they have they just knew all by God is the grace it's like we here God is so nothing good in us but by his grace he saved us by his grace he loved us that is it those are the common people you see for them they say oh we don't have any greatness whatever but we just follow Jesus and he loves us and whatever that is true so good enough no money had to travel with the common people who can understand very well the message of Elijah then they turned around and they said so maybe they gave him all those kind of respects and so on if a prophet tells you to do something can't you do sir you do it because this is not Syria this is not our country this is different and and under the one above that is God himself he knows how to make his laws maybe why can't you oh I they convinced him until he came in the line coming in the line is to go and do according to the saying of the prophet then he went to Jordan because Jordan has a meaning says Jordan means death and a true life because there's a court because we don't have time but this quote about that yeah they are we shall read just few and then we're about to finish okay he says like this let's read uh letting of pressure letting off pressure at the message letting of pressure he says now one day the human race was in a truck under there comes someone to the Earth by the name of Jesus Christ Jesus mean is Jehovah savior and he went down the Jordan of death went over the Jordan any death and raise up on Easter morning with the evidence that a man can live after he dies Hallelujah death is not the end Jesus proved it that a man can live after he died so you see now Naman must live again with a good life but he must go where the symbol means he must go to Jordan not in his own River in their area no not in something another substitute no if a prophet saying to your dad it must be Jordan and when he said 70 times it must be 70 times there is no question why why can't it be free sir no you don't say three or four it must be seven because everything that God does or he says has a meaning purpose praise the Lord then he went and they dipped himself seven times after that he received a changed the body Hallelujah [Music] he received that changing the body we want to receive change the bodies but what we do is to remain lining up [Music] in the line and the follow God's instructions we need not to reason or to complain or whatever already has to be obedient amen and we need not to say we want him to come back brother Branham to come back and preach again for what he is in the house that's enough we need to just a voice praise the Lord yeah that's how we can gain our faith is just believing what a prophet said then someone say oh if I hear I wish I could have been the time of brother brothers held me of this sickness I tell you just stay in the line the reward shall come things will flow amen what you do is to tell God God I have not deviated from the right I am in the life look at that woman in Memphis down there that black woman that's right she had the faith in God she prayed the whole night but God is saying the only way how can I flow the reward or a miracle I want you to line up behind the prophet amen amen I want to be alive and I can do anything I can even ground the planes not to go praise the Lord and that happened and the problem said I can hear someone saying go go go then I said where am I going but he's saying go go go there is a woman who is waiting for you she's waiting to line up she wants a reward she has a problem and when he went and she believed in the Bible who knows he says oh yeah that's true yeah and they lined up and our son was healed monster hearty when a prophet was picking something about the screw hunting oh she responded to pick you up praise the Lord there's nothing God With God that word made God happy because when God looked down the other men were there but they were still ah doubting a bit how can it be but when she responded so quickly that means she is turning the line so quickly and when God looked the line is so perfect he said ah what else again please I'm a true God you're a true Prophet tell her what she needs and I will send to her I want salvation of my two kids there it happened praise the Lord brothers and assistance we need to stay in the life [Music] people are tired they are going astray I have seen that is happening in the whole world but a very good picture in the Bible is there we shall receive a prophet is the reward as long as we stay behind the message God bless you tonight [Applause] ah I love him ah because [Music] [Music] oh God boring [Music] sing again I love him more oh yes yes [Music] tomorrow [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] let's pray father what
