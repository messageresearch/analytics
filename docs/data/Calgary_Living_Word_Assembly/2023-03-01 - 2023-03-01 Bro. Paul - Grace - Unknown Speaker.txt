comfortable I am no problem with God so take me out of the window I stick to arsenals thank you Father Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen so um before I start this evening um let me introduce myself I think you all know me very well but um my work I'm doing is my next name and so when you go home and you see the doctor and I'm going to be confused like who is in your life and so although I I sometimes use tall because this kind of easy for people to understand so that can you connect you know it's first of all I don't speak very well because hahaha and you also think that I don't speak very well anyway I Was Born This Way foreign three times and in field three times uh however God who need to mentioned he knows how to use his people's life I'm not coming to call someone like me who cannot speak well and say we are going to be like a legendary it doesn't make sense it's not possible first of all I against people secondly um I'm fine I'm never exactly when I was praying you not took me to Exodus chapter 4. um you know Moses speaking like he said God give me everyone to speak for me foreign right but beyond the Miracles God will voice speaking and so those that are coming to the to the Miracles must Miss The Voice because they are looking only at the miracle amen but worldwide in Numbers Chapter 14. chapter 14. when um um moves from 12 styles to clean up right and this selected so it wasn't in London out of every class of Israel well let me make it still play this man my elders in the truck there are men who have been in the message for a long time and so they understood everything and I was like they were chosen they are professions they knew the laws they use everything that muscles use and so they are influencer and so they were chosen you know because it was a missed multitude two people go who are following Moses because of the sign and those following muscles because of The Voice two now listen closely those foreign what and so when we have 12 people because all the return because all their hearts were in the science of Miracles Giants what things are Madness muscles does not have or the science that we have seen before is not enough to conquer these people because they are looking at the size and so when you came back they said Moses everything you told us is true they did not deny the fact want to shake is true God remember that's why and when when the husband came to eat okay did God tell you that was that was wonderful but book book the devil always as a conjunction to the word of God ask something to me he does not really good night I thought healed the roof and crumble and that way in Latin cancer form when you came to Christ he created this Christmas and so the brother used to cook very well no when the women who came out and when they were coming I said Moses but we shot Giants and we saw things the report that we had convict all Israel foreign far away and so foreign was too powerful that the prophet of the day was not held and I think again I said the salon got those 10 people got the message of that game was no hand what was love we've come to another time you know uh the American Medical uh uh in the men's group when he said that um the world is promoting for things men men want to become women and women want to become men and guys anything right foreign [Music] long long horse in the car to the airport to the rocket and then that's how the message has moved down the edges and you can say that we are now in the locker right in time that we the last coming time not listening now the world is closing things foreign [Music] [Music] and crying against the abdomination in the world Holy Ghost those who feel and so the most dear people that requires times against that abomination not to complain not tomorrow but men can be underneath crying against the solution and that is where we are today you've got you can join yourself Gomorrah we are in such a situation to come to destroy that City is Nick James James yeah the other thing does not invite us man every day he was crying in hanging every day the field of the city and we are in in before our you know and you figure you see the things like things but right before our very eyes we see both things that a man did not marry a man a woman reminding a woman an animal he doesn't make sense because like that to show them but people think that it's not true but now before our eyes we see those things dimensions that is our reaction to it the angel when God do to shine to to people and stand on those that are trying against the abomination in life now I would try to introduce myself open floor foreign do what are his work so um okay fine foreign foreign because God has done this all titles upon them and God shall not in all the things all your life amen oh I want to stick on drinks and then I'm not just sticking on doing like doing with all your games I just want to bring about something that the grace of God is playing purpose now Adam what was that is now at this point mindfulness I want to look at himself I think that he was naked this is a man he got the Dominion in fact that was a perfect man man that's what it means physical so Adam had this castle of a perfect man and that was perfect he had dominion over all in time of Adam what we call Supernatural to bring was natural do you understand foreign [Music] animal everything he learned them because he had the authority now Adam had the authority of God on Earth right okay no what happened that is in the word of God because right because the water the other thing that God has necessity his world and goes his own name do you understand God Has Lifted his own world as those his own land no no Adam coming down and in his basement missions the Bible says that the man was not refused because the woman being translation So Adam knew what he was doing when he didn't ask and then the cause of the wife you know to Adam this woman to tackle me I thought if this woman will die let me die tell us again you see that God lost Fellowship now it is God came down for Fellowship right as of course Owings to to bring God only some kinds of services why God lost Fellowship and what that evening God came I think he did not know what happened God knew what happened so Adam where are you now foreign [Music] to the devil if you have to remove it it is not to the devil that was why Adam was I don't know I don't want to hide the focus is good because he looks like a sweet dreams of course I could not cover him foreign [Music] foreign God did not attribute to the Earth to agonize the Act was to be second and gotten justification they never did it in your first name turn to the circus is not asking many questions no at that time the girl who became confused because the devil has its own plan and at that time his home plan he thought that he has gotten what he was looking for his plan was actually in English [Music] because in resignation this doesn't make us to understand that before the world ever to God that will not go swimming right I wish together new and so when God came down to four things I don't drink yet remember because God that came looking for Adam not Adam looking for God can you have messed up he was hiding and then God came to him okay it was not of work that animal will do and then as I'm doing a perfect type of life why Eve was making sure quiet dying for when you can't go from America before God would like what we are saying is not I'm not I'm not trying to to use food and make magical I'm trying to show you from the scriptures to us so that we can have confidence in the word of God and when you think you speak with confidence because look at what you are saying is in the world no because foreign [Music] [Music] Genesis of God and so yes there was fornication in the garden of England but the thing was underneath because the woman God gave it that Lord God shall not equal this and all that is that he came to do was to make sure that she is [Music] the very word of God because that work and make him because that's what he stopped the world as he came into being that same world we turn our backwards now don't bring was there even before the world ever to God no because Noah and I will see that all we read the class not all well every every day but look at how it looks like no when you are hungry the other thing that you are free for 120 years never found something that made them convinced and confirmed 120 years will come from that every day you are thinking 120 years Americans I'm like sometimes while 20 times four of my age and this man every day he will go with his microphone because the marketplace I'm speaking God is calling just this act every day look on that no contact then it doesn't make sense that you have the word of God and it is not conducting people but what makes sense but those he met something that many convenes that this is God's word you see so you are not even pass some time for wonders well yet he was so shocking of the word of God for like 20 years so at the time you can ask and in those days they are good scientists good scientists the science I hope they look over they saw everything from animals using influence let me show something here foreign foreign I really care no because when he was speaking the last time he stood on groups being a covenant now I want to look forward not according to the clothing life like I made in the father and the day because foreign what how that came and then today we want to make the mission in mental stuff so when I have one line one thousand one hundred uh Commandments like that until the message becomes a relation to you amen you have to be a reservation to be revealed and until you come to that point you are not a Christian but anything that is going without food anything I mean anything that is done without faith in sin and so meaning that for a Believer every step that he says he must give that resolution and so we need to understand when we say we are in the message we need to understand what we are talking about [Music] in English in that time again a new heart and then if you think and then I'll give my experience in them foreign [Music] that is the message the Bible says that the message is the Holy Ghost foreign logically because that's what we have to do people the slave message in a logical sequence right this is right and so and so today this Castle comes into exhausting doctors mental yoga and I will put my love in the mind and write them in their heart is not good but you come in Houston Texas right before man life in your heart that thing this is Christianity I'm trying to think of something that this is Christianity when Christ why would he tell Joshua this one day and night and when you Google you have good questions let's be written in the presence of your heart I you you ever wonder the program told us that the greatest that you ever fought foreign I know because we have something else in our heart that is not the world and that was like when the guy said something he said the reason why you don't hear the voice of God it was because they are hearing and another voice and your love's wife of God or you're hearing another one that's what you see all these things are in the message but we don't have time for the message because we also lose the message okay and they shall not treat every nice middle or it is the work of God God doing it now let me go to Abraham Joshua Joshua where he was about to die or something yeah and told them the fella of Abraham Taylor was uh an agonica so Abraham came from an angle Washington family foreign no nothing foreign what because when he was born even his father his grandfather foreign foreign [Music] if you walking with God every step of the way little family lives use everything what am I going through I don't know and God showed me something and then he kept moving a lot oh lots of network and then they kept moving now as I was 75 years when God called him seven to five years an old man and then the brother called me they didn't make any promise he called me informed me online I don't know foreign [Music] [Music] no if those of God to whom you are supposed to bring and I was trying to understand things so the the length of employment and that what was God doing first of all the damn Christian missions now the work of God also in concentration foreign now this is 24 years this man has been working with God and God has made him a promise of his son for 24 years 199 years now and God will come back soon I want to go and Destroy them when you see my friends your friend new song The God Who made the heaven in order to have your friend yes you cannot give me a shot you thank God foreign and if government says that a man walking with the greatest god 25 years looking and guys God came back after Abraham my friend in that situation my friend had to have two things it is not just Christians it's not just about nothing but your character while working hahaha your character while working that is thankful so ever ever have in all this information when God came to destruction a man who has no no child oh that's good for them was worse than that every time because I can find 10. everyone was ready to go and to show them to drive around your life now everyone how to happen because God has been Abraham in front right then after 12 years God thank God okay and it came to talk Abraham foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] looking for now God doesn't sacrifice them now let's burn him yeah this is my life about God he took Isaac why do you have is painful but now what was God going this is the highest level of succession where a man can die to walk in love for God What is love what was love because if you love me pick my Commandments Commandments and so if they have otherwise [Music] even even Isaac did not know why he was going through and everyone in his heart was crying oh God I am going to happen a lot of walking foreign [Music] now the grace of God when you look at Hebrews the account of God on your behalf because he he will not right laughs Hallelujah okay very well he was not just an adult right and then in that mission I'm not on the universe so that on the user of on the losers so from a group of the river a great one so when you go to classical and ask for a harlot you will not show you rehab so not just normal okay now foreign talking because oh yes and Christ came from her Christ came from the language of New York in Hollywood of hollow now John chapter 4 drunk after Inc ground four the woman and well American right two of us and I don't know how to do things we have four horsemen but the one that you have now is not inside foreign [Music] [Music] lost so who foreign work in her heart he said no you threw some people and you look as well they are gone they are dead you go to the conditions that they are into it one day I I went to Marble station um so when I was struggling I saw this homeless people and I was trying to like avoid them in my room I think of God in that situation and what we have spoken to him I would have been an expression of the grace of God to him at that time but I did not oh um the power of God is greater than God's power foreign this one was talked in the act and so let us hear what you have to say now the government mistake that morning in doesn't make a mistake because to Christ [Laughter] Anna because was present at that time for that woman and so when the sound shoes who were at that time the highest level of Christianity I don't understand that did you put delivery assistant so let's not do that but the other one that called the summer as well as at that time according to restriction that woman was meant to die [Music] yeah it was a mental knowledge because assuming they knew the grace of God recognize that you thank you standing before them was very brilliant we are looking for was calling and the terrible woman and the dragon was that it was a conclusion for Christ classical music they are looking like an adult life could be five things and so why you are holding your stroke at all that kind of measures when clients choose dimensions all of them it was hot in their heart yesterday foreign [Music] and then that woman you cannot tell her that what should make that game was not good because on mental she was supposed to die in fact God has lost my last day on Earth I hope to die according to the scriptures after that time and so foreign go home no more no I've been talking about all the results doesn't a thing you know how you start from under your skin first of all the first respect was to bring the ark not in the way of God gospel do not the problem now when I was looking after I was laughing I was talking in my room doesn't Israel went to war baby who is the pastor did not go so he came home why he was supposed to bring the battlefield to stay home and then the Dragon so when he went out he saw that woman well that's another point foreign now because David is a seed of God God has to get this and immorganisms Morgan adultery I don't know how big of God's eye absolutely he never had there's no person for that girl to return he was okay with it yo the guy who can bring you africanisms I want you to return from this but God who is God had to send a process because remind him now when he went to church David's own government condemned him and so David was supposed to die that's something by his own government now I was talking so much time but I want to have to make I want someone anymore now I will not go up here oh I'm just trying to do nothing the work of Grace why was God bringing everyone to that point to him why was God bringing Moses to that point where God Called Moses you cannot encounter all these years now but one mistake he's talking about twice [Music] [Music] let me show you something when Moses died the devil came to Texas governor it doesn't have to let God right for that problem has sinned as well at that time you got Paul when God bring power to for where he was to employ it like I said foreign gospel of God oh any man who has worked with God must come to report how before die how many people can die two times Escape when the angel went back and to do some time to die so he went back knowing that he was going to die imagine surrender to God Is So Many important but what I'm saying that language I mean important Miss God if it comes through a manuscripts meeting together the one figure when it happens that if you can knock life down to a call what was God doing back together the grace of God is to bring us to a place where you can come only important to do I was talking right now um foreign with me what we are talking about testimony of God or for your life and that's all that matters that the drug will be the last voice amen it's lovable it means that God will scoop through the drive in this day now remember that the reason why we are the reason why there is still calmness everywhere is because of the blind nothing from the floor if those because of the elect this is something right and because it's very illegal Syria the grace of God will come upon the Earth right now why we are here how do we express that grace of God are we not supposed to be an expression of God bless ings of Jesus Christ everything he went to God preaching the gospel of the world but how come a song that loses his server is of no use user when you are not testing you you you you you go past like there's no sound of you are you you're happy with the problem of Christianity [Music] no [Music] Jesus [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] I believe we heard from Heaven tonight it's amazing how even though we can have maybe a speech impediment and still have the ability to connect spiritually and say Amen to that word my the resounding thought that I have tonight I I could I got so many points but the resounding thought I have is you know what Don't Preach me a message live it that's what we need to be doing in this day when we walk past the lame and the halt the drug addicts the homeless live a message live the message of Jesus Christ my goodness show that walk of Grace oh and then we can bring it right down home to our home here you know how how will the world know that you love me you have loved one for another we're not backbiting and talking and fighting and arguing and bickering and all that no no we're extending Grace We're living that walk of Grace my goodness maybe we'll just sing that song faithful one as we close tonight we'll just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're so thankful for your grace tonight Lord father we know that when the spies met the Harlot father that she took the time to express to them that the enemy's Hearts melt within them because they know oh Father they know who's in their land and father we thank you for that tonight we thank you for your lineage Lord we thank you for your Plan of Redemption Lord Jesus right from the book of Genesis all the way through to Revelation Lord Jesus recognizing that seventh seal is wide open before our wandering eyes and father we know that there was there was two types of people one wanted to see The Works father oh but Lord there was one that just wanted to hear your word and I believe tonight father that's our desire is just to hear your word father Lord just tell us one more time father that we are the sinless Spotless virtuous bride that you have chosen to be your expression to this age Lord oh Father it's even gone beyond the prophet and I know people will shake it those words but it's not about going beyond the word of the Prophet it's the life that's gone beyond the prophet now into the bride and father we're so thankful that we can recognize our position in you we just pray that tonight father you would bless brother Paul that you would restore his strength father that you would just bless his walk father bless his way all of the interests in his life

will for us to gather again on Sunday Lord we will be so thankful father to give you all the praise and all the glory of our hearts we ask that you would just bless brother Toby father with a fresh call off the altar Lord that he would feed your children one more time we love you we thank you Lord Jesus we ask all of these things now in the name above every name the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
