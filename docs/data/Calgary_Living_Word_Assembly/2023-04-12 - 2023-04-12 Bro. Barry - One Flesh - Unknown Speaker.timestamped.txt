[22:04] there's nobody that we adore more
[22:07] and father the only way we can say that
[22:09] is because you predestinated that seed
[22:11] in us to accept the word that you
[22:13] delivered in this hour Lord you
[22:16] descended yourself oh God you didn't
[22:18] trust a man but you came down yourself
[22:20] oh God just like in the times of Abraham
[22:23] and the plains of mamara Lord You Came
[22:25] Down spoke through a man told the
[22:27] secrets of the heart told the secrets
[22:29] behind our beloved beloved Prophet Lord
[22:32] you did all these things delivered a
[22:34] word that we could count on a Vindicated
[22:37] word is Lord we we we heard in this one

[39:27] enjoyed this special tonight
[39:30] 's voice if you have a need tonight
[39:33] maybe just make it known unto the Lord
[39:34] with an uplift hand as we go to him in
[39:36] prayer just have a few requests we want
[39:38] to remember
[39:40] Frank I want to keep him before the Lord
[39:42] sister Michelle Livesey has a pulled
[39:46] back
[39:47] they're back home but they're just not
[39:49] feeling well so they're at home
[39:53] and I just want to continue to remember
[39:55] brother Isaiah
[39:58] and brother Koshi and his family
[40:01] if you have a need just make it known
[40:03] unto him as we go
[40:05] gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[40:07] tonight we're so thankful that we have
[40:09] the ability Lord
[40:11] to look away to Jesus
[40:13] [Music]
[40:14] rather that we could look upon you Lord
[40:17] Jesus and we know that in the world that
[40:21] we live in there's so many different
[40:22] ideas and so many different flavors
[40:26] of how that could be how we could look
[40:29] upon you father
[40:31] but we know that you are the same
[40:34] yesterday today and forever
[40:37] and you'd change not Lord and that's one
[40:39] of the greatest tricks of the devil is
[40:42] to try and get us to believe that you
[40:44] change but we know that heavens and
[40:46] earth will pass away but your word will
[40:48] remain so father we thank you for
[40:51] sending us a prophet thank you for
[40:52] speaking to us through him thank you for
[40:54] giving us ears to hear and hearts to
[40:56] receive the word for our day Lord
[40:59] tonight we just want to remember each
[41:01] hand that was made known unto you father
[41:03] each need behind the hand that was
[41:05] lifted to you father tonight we just ask
[41:08] that you would meet the need father
[41:09] behind the request Lord we want to
[41:13] continue to remember Isaiah before your
[41:16] throne Lord Jesus
[41:18] father we know that we have a story in
[41:21] your your Bible about how the disciples
[41:24] tried to cast out that devil and and
[41:27] they couldn't do it and they came to you
[41:29] the father came to you distraught and
[41:31] asked why could they not
[41:34] and we know that you said it was because
[41:36] of their unbelief
[41:37] but there was a way
[41:40] father we just pray that you would touch
[41:42] that boy in the name of Jesus
[41:44] that you would bring healing to the
[41:45] family Lord that you would bring rest
[41:47] Lord
[41:48] father we thank you for your goodness we
[41:51] just want to remember brother Frank
[41:52] Cronkite Lord before your throne we
[41:54] thank you for your leadership we thank
[41:56] you for your guidance your direction and
[41:58] most of all your healing touch Lord we
[42:01] know our bodies need healing but more
[42:03] than anything our souls do father and we
[42:05] thank you for touching our brother Lord
[42:08] we pray that you would just raise him up
[42:10] father in the name of Jesus
[42:13] whether we want to also remember sister
[42:15] Michelle
[42:16] he's got a sore back lord and we know
[42:19] that can be super painful and we just
[42:21] pray that you would take away the pain
[42:22] in the name of Jesus that you would
[42:24] restore her health back lord in the name
[42:27] of Jesus we pray that you would be with
[42:29] all those who are traveling Lord that
[42:31] you would keep your hand upon them that
[42:32] you would bring them back home safely at
[42:35] the appointed time and now father we
[42:37] just ask that you would bless our
[42:39] service with your presence we know we've
[42:41] already invited you and we know that
[42:43] we're two or three are gathered together
[42:45] in your name according to your word that
[42:47] you're there and tonight father we just
[42:49] welcome you father we greet you father
[42:51] we want to wash your feet Lord and
[42:54] appreciate you Lord Jesus we want to
[42:56] greet you with a kiss Lord and we want
[42:58] to anoint you Lord Jesus we want you to
[43:01] feel welcome here in our midst Lord we
[43:03] don't want to just invite you Lord and
[43:06] seat you in a corner and just ignore you
[43:08] father we pray that Lord we would just
[43:10] have that Dynamic relationship of
[43:12] intimacy with you tonight father that
[43:15] you would speak to us Lord and father
[43:17] we'll be careful to give you all the
[43:19] praise and all the glory we just ask
[43:21] that you would bless our service now in
[43:23] a supernatural way in Jesus Christ's
[43:26] name we pray amen
[43:29] amen
[43:30] God bless you tonight thank you
[43:32] musicians
[43:33] you have your Bibles I would like to go
[43:36] back to
[43:37] the book of Ephesians
[43:42] and I would like to talk about our
[43:45] positions
[43:47] a little further tonight
[43:53] book of Ephesians chapter 5.
[43:57] sorry I didn't say that
[44:01] Ephesians chapter 5.
[44:05] and I just I keep going a little bit
[44:08] further and further backwards but the
[44:10] word just keeps speaking to me and so if
[44:13] we could start reading from verse 20 in
[44:15] Ephesians chapter 5.
[44:17] I think that'd be good
[44:19] it says giving thanks always for all
[44:22] things unto God and the father in the
[44:25] name of our Lord Jesus Christ I believe
[44:28] we could just stop right there and say
[44:30] Amen it's just a beautiful thing to just
[44:33] be able to give thanks for all things
[44:35] verse 21 submitting yourselves one to
[44:38] another in the fear of God
[44:41] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[44:43] husbands as unto the Lord
[44:46] for the husband is the head of the wife
[44:48] even as Christ is the head of the church
[44:50] and he is the savior of the body
[44:52] therefore as the church is subject unto
[44:55] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[44:58] husbands in every thing
[45:00] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[45:03] also loved the church and gave himself
[45:06] for it
[45:07] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[45:09] with the washing of the Water by the
[45:12] word
[45:13] that he might present it to himself a
[45:17] glorious church not having spot or
[45:19] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[45:21] should be holy and without blemish
[45:24] so ought men to love their wives as
[45:26] their own bodies
[45:28] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[45:31] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[45:34] but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as
[45:38] the Lord the church
[45:40] for we are members of his body of his
[45:43] flesh and of his bones
[45:46] for this cause shall a man leave his
[45:48] father and mother and shall be joined
[45:50] unto his wife and they too shall be one
[45:53] flesh
[45:54] this is a great mystery but I speak
[45:56] concerning Christ and the church
[45:59] nevertheless let every one of you in
[46:01] particular so love his wife even as
[46:04] himself and the wife
[46:06] see that she reverence her husband
[46:09] chapter 6. children obey your parents in
[46:13] the Lord for this is right
[46:16] honor thy father and mother which is the
[46:20] first commandment with promise that it
[46:22] may be well with thee and thou mayest
[46:25] live long on the Earth
[46:27] and ye fathers provoke not your children
[46:30] to wrath but bring them up in the
[46:32] nurture and admonition of the Lord
[46:36] let's just bow in prayer one more time
[46:39] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[46:41] word Lord we thank you for the
[46:43] Revelation behind it thank you for your
[46:46] goodness to us Lord and that we can
[46:47] rejoice in all things father because we
[46:50] know that you have ordained us to be
[46:52] here this day father to hear this word
[46:55] Lord Jesus to be the living witness of
[46:58] your life here on Earth
[47:00] and father we pray that one more time
[47:02] you would just break this bread of life
[47:03] open to us fresh father that you would
[47:06] just reveal it to us Lord we can try and
[47:08] talk about it all we want and we can
[47:10] walk around in circles and point at it
[47:13] and poke at it but father unless you
[47:15] reveal it Lord we're just going to have
[47:17] a study but when you come father we know
[47:20] that changes everything so we just
[47:22] invite you Lord Jesus to take the full
[47:24] preeminence that you desire tonight in
[47:27] your word in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[47:29] amen God bless you tonight you may be
[47:32] seated
[47:33] if I had to title it tonight I talk
[47:36] about our positions a lot we've talked
[47:39] about husbands we've talked about wives
[47:41] we've talked about children and I think
[47:43] we will do all of that tonight but I
[47:46] want to talk about this mystery that
[47:48] Paul is talking about here to the
[47:50] Ephesian church this is a great mystery
[47:54] but I speak concerning Christ in the
[47:56] church
[47:57] and how important it is to recognize our
[47:59] position in him
[48:01] so if I had to title it tonight I want
[48:03] to title it one flesh
[48:05] the ending of verse 31 for this cause
[48:08] shall a man leave his father and mother
[48:11] and shall be joined unto his wife
[48:14] and they too shall be one flesh
[48:18] I think it's amazing when you look at
[48:20] that we know that traditionally
[48:22] according to uh I would say even a
[48:25] Christian marriage
[48:27] the wife takes the name of the husband
[48:30] and it's not the other way around the
[48:32] husband does not take the name of the
[48:34] wife
[48:35] but we know that the way the times have
[48:38] changed and and traditions have evolved
[48:41] the devil has eroded the way things had
[48:44] been done for so many years that it's
[48:47] it's changed and now you can keep both
[48:50] names
[48:51] and you can hyphenate the names and
[48:54] sometimes the husband will just take the
[48:57] wife's name but it's for a strange
[49:00] purpose because the way it was ordained
[49:02] from the beginning it was simple it was
[49:05] that the wife took the husband's name
[49:07] and that is the way it works with the
[49:10] word of God I think it's such a
[49:12] beautiful thing because none of this is
[49:13] in my notes this whole name thing but
[49:16] isn't it wonderful that we take his name
[49:19] we take the name of Jesus Christ and if
[49:22] we take any other name then we're
[49:23] missing the point we're missing all of
[49:26] this mystery we're missing the
[49:27] revelation
[49:29] and I just think it's a beautiful thing
[49:32] you know um I just was thinking about it
[49:34] tonight and and I just wanted to mention
[49:36] something I got a quote that came to
[49:39] mind before I even get into that I get
[49:41] excited I'm sorry
[49:43] it's wonderful I love the word
[49:45] um we have announcement
[49:47] um we have brother Dale Smith I spoke to
[49:49] him today he sends a big greetings to
[49:51] the church and he's coming to Canada in
[49:54] June and uh so he'll be coming by
[49:58] Calgary uh on the seventh he's going to
[50:00] take the service it'll be a Wednesday
[50:01] night then he's going to travel up to
[50:03] Edmonton and do a little fishing and a
[50:05] little bit of church up there and then
[50:07] he will be traveling back home again so
[50:10] we had such a tremendous conversation
[50:12] this morning he just wanted to send his
[50:14] greetings and let you know he thinks
[50:16] about us and prays for us and it's
[50:19] certainly wonderful to have a friend
[50:21] that remembers us
[50:24] but you know talking about prayer just
[50:27] getting into uh sort of a for free
[50:29] thought tonight when we talk about
[50:31] prayer I just wanted to encourage us
[50:33] brothers and sisters we're not living in
[50:36] a situation where
[50:38] um
[50:39] we should expect to see miraculous great
[50:42] signs and wonders we talk about this a
[50:44] fair bit but you know we prayed for
[50:47] Isaiah the other night there and uh the
[50:50] boy with severe autism so much so that
[50:52] his parents don't sleep at night and and
[50:55] and they're afraid to come to church
[50:56] because he will disrupt service so they
[50:59] haven't come to church anywhere for a
[51:02] long time and you know it's kind of
[51:05] troubled me a little bit in terms of we
[51:08] pray for him and he goes away the same
[51:10] and keeping in touch with uh brother
[51:13] koshy find out that not much has changed
[51:16] in the house in fact it's gotten a
[51:17] little worse and and I said to him you
[51:20] know I don't want to celebrate that but
[51:22] I do want to remind you that that's
[51:24] actually a sign that something's
[51:26] changing
[51:27] we don't want to actually give up and
[51:29] say that nothing has happened because
[51:31] we've had prayer that nothing has
[51:33] happened but the Branham talks about it
[51:35] and we know in the Bible full well that
[51:38] Daniel Prayed for help Daniel Prayed For
[51:40] assistance and we know the angel of the
[51:42] Lord came his way but he had to fight
[51:44] through the Prince of Persia and it was
[51:46] 21 days of waiting before he heard an
[51:50] answer to his prayer we don't
[51:52] necessarily see miraculous in our day
[51:55] sometimes we do and sometimes we don't
[51:58] but we know one thing is for sure God
[52:00] always hears our prayers
[52:03] I just want to read a quote about this
[52:06] sometimes brother random says it
[52:08] sometimes God is spontaneous and
[52:10] sometimes he's not
[52:11] sometimes it just happens and sometimes
[52:13] it just doesn't
[52:15] and I personally have seen both and I'm
[52:17] sure we all have in our lives
[52:19] but he says this and and one morning
[52:22] after I guess five weeks or more four or
[52:26] five weeks I forget just what she said
[52:28] telling the story about two sisters that
[52:31] God prayed for
[52:32] but nothing happened in their lives
[52:34] nothing changed
[52:37] he says I forget what she said she was
[52:39] washing the dishes one morning the
[52:41] children had gone to school
[52:43] and all of a sudden she had a real
[52:45] strange feeling strike her this is a
[52:48] sister that couldn't eat
[52:49] she could not eat food
[52:51] she was withering away she was starving
[52:54] to death literally
[52:56] but she had a real strange feeling
[52:58] striker one morning it was just in the
[53:00] normal course of life
[53:02] a real strange feeling struck her she
[53:05] thought what is this
[53:08] she felt real blessed
[53:10] so then she thought well maybe it's just
[53:13] the Lord blessing me
[53:15] just dovetails with our scripture you
[53:17] know we can have joy we can just rejoice
[53:19] in all things for What the Lord Has Done
[53:21] For Us right she was a very fine
[53:24] Christian woman young woman in about her
[53:26] 30s and she got real hungry
[53:29] and she said oh how I would like to be
[53:32] able to eat just a little piece of toast
[53:34] can you imagine that not even being able
[53:37] to eat a little piece of toast just like
[53:39] to eat a little piece of toast and she
[53:41] sat down and eat the toast just in a few
[53:44] moments it come up
[53:46] would have done it but that time it
[53:49] stayed down
[53:50] felt good
[53:52] well she thought you know
[53:54] if that's so I believe I'll just eat
[53:57] some of these oats here that some of the
[53:59] children left in their plate
[54:01] so she sets down and eats the oats
[54:05] now you know what oatmeal would do on an
[54:08] acid stomach and she weighed about 15 or
[54:11] 20 minutes and it never bothered her
[54:14] so she sat down and had her a real
[54:18] gastronomical Jubilee she fried her some
[54:22] eggs got her a cup of coffee and just
[54:25] really enjoyed it and she waited about
[54:27] 20 or 30 minutes and usually in five
[54:30] minutes she done threw it up
[54:33] and she felt so good
[54:35] she said you know I just can't keep this
[54:38] good thing to myself
[54:40] so I went down the street and she went
[54:42] to a neighbor that had been praying
[54:44] for the same night who had been prayed
[54:47] for the same night who had a growth on
[54:49] the side of her neck
[54:51] well her husband was retired they'd
[54:53] gotten up late
[54:55] and when she got
[54:57] to such a house a few doors below her
[55:01] she thought they had the Salvation Army
[55:03] in there
[55:04] she never heard so much shouting and
[55:06] going on in all her life
[55:08] she thought well what's wrong
[55:11] she runs in and says Lydia what's the
[55:13] matter
[55:15] she said oh Bertha I want to tell you I
[55:18] just got up I was laying here I'd been
[55:21] awake for a little while I felt real
[55:24] strange feeling and we shook even the
[55:27] bed sheets on the bed we can't find that
[55:29] lump it's gone
[55:33] well she told her her story
[55:36] and they just got all enthused and got
[55:39] themselves somebody in the neighborhood
[55:41] and come into one of my meetings which
[55:43] was about a thousand miles away and they
[55:46] gave their testimony
[55:47] but the Branham says now what happened
[55:50] the angel of God
[55:53] who had pronounced that blessing had
[55:56] passed through the neighborhood
[55:57] confirming it
[56:00] many people would say well wasn't that
[56:02] angel of the Lord William Branham no
[56:05] he was just standing there when he came
[56:08] right isn't that the truth brothers and
[56:10] sisters
[56:12] and when tonight we're talking about one
[56:14] flesh
[56:15] this is the life we're living this is
[56:18] the reality of Who We Are
[56:20] when we pray for someone it's not even
[56:23] us praying brothers and sisters
[56:26] and if it is us praying then we've
[56:28] missed the mark
[56:30] because it's got to be his Spirit living
[56:33] out through us
[56:36] he says now what happened the angel of
[56:38] God
[56:39] who had pronounced that blessing
[56:41] had passed through the neighborhood
[56:43] confirming it you see
[56:45] what if they would have give up
[56:48] don't give up you believe stay with it
[56:51] God will bring it to pass
[56:54] sometimes God isn't spontaneously on
[56:57] things how many knows that Daniel Prayed
[57:00] and it taken I believe it was 28 days
[57:02] the angel said for he could get to him
[57:04] is that right 21 days that's right thank
[57:07] you sir 21 days before he could get
[57:10] there but he heard him
[57:13] and every time that you move towards god
[57:16] with faith God knows it see
[57:19] just don't worry
[57:21] be real full of faith and just keep
[57:24] believing
[57:25] brothers and sisters tonight I just want
[57:28] to encourage us
[57:30] don't give up on any one of our prayers
[57:33] just keep believing
[57:37] and you know if our faith starts to fail
[57:39] I want to say this that's a good thing
[57:42] because our faith has to fail we have to
[57:45] find the end of our faith because our
[57:47] faith won't get us out of here we know
[57:49] that in our age we need more faith than
[57:52] any other age
[57:54] we need rapturing faith brother Branham
[57:56] said that's the only way we're going to
[57:58] get there and that kind of Faith
[57:59] brothers and sisters it's not something
[58:00] we're going to drum up we're not going
[58:02] to have a worship service and just work
[58:04] it out of us that's what the
[58:05] Pentecostals are trying to do the only
[58:07] thing that's going to do and I'm so
[58:09] thankful I heard brother Paul say it
[58:10] it's his word that's the only thing
[58:13] that's going to do it we talked about it
[58:14] on Sunday it's the word to the word it's
[58:17] that spoken word from the angel to that
[58:20] genetic see Gene word of God down on the
[58:23] inside of the inside of the believer
[58:25] that when they hear it they just can't
[58:27] handle it it changes them from the
[58:30] inside out
[58:32] so I just wanted to encourage us don't
[58:34] don't worry Don't Be Afraid don't get
[58:36] impatient just keep believing and
[58:38] confessing we know that we had that that
[58:41] story that John Ryan I just can't get it
[58:44] out of my mind because I can relate to
[58:46] the guy once upon a time I was a blind
[58:48] shoe cobbler literally but you know I
[58:51] was never blind sorry figuratively but I
[58:54] was a shoe cobbler but I was blind to
[58:56] the word of God I had no idea who I was
[58:59] living in the world living in sin
[59:01] completely out in the world but you know
[59:04] one time I heard the truth
[59:06] and we know that this guy he heard the
[59:07] truth as well he was blind physically
[59:10] and he couldn't see and he went up and
[59:12] got prayed for by the prophet where all
[59:15] the healings were happening and he
[59:17] walked away from the from the platform
[59:19] and he was still blind and then he came
[59:21] back in the prayer line and we had know
[59:23] the conversation really well I keep
[59:25] talking about it but I think it's
[59:26] important to remind us stir up our Pure
[59:28] Minds by way of remembrance this is
[59:30] something that happened in our
[59:31] generation he came back and said to
[59:33] William Mary and Branham hey I I I'm not
[59:36] I'm not I can't see I'm still blind
[59:39] but I think it's beautiful when we look
[59:41] at this because it wasn't William
[59:42] Bradham that pronounced that healing on
[59:43] those two sisters was it it was the
[59:45] angel of the Lord so who was it that he
[59:47] was speaking to in that moment when he
[59:50] said I thought you said I was healed
[59:53] that voice said to him I thought you
[59:55] said you believed we have to have
[59:58] unwavering Faith brothers and sisters
[1:00:00] and you know when when when it gets to
[1:00:02] be shaky that's when we get strong
[1:00:04] because his strength is made perfect in
[1:00:08] our weakness that's where we see his
[1:00:11] strength and when we get to our weakest
[1:00:13] moments of Faith where we don't know we
[1:00:15] just don't know because we've never
[1:00:17] experienced it before just take that
[1:00:19] step
[1:00:20] and he'll have that stare for our foot
[1:00:22] to land on he will make sure that it
[1:00:24] happens for us
[1:00:26] I just want to encourage us don't give
[1:00:28] up don't don't doubt don't don't think
[1:00:31] that it's not going to happen
[1:00:33] it has to happen that word was
[1:00:35] pronounced we prayed God heard our
[1:00:38] prayers
[1:00:41] are you happy tonight
[1:00:44] today I want to talk about our position
[1:00:45] and our position is that we will be one
[1:00:47] flesh with him
[1:00:49] I am my father are one
[1:00:51] we have to be and and that's the
[1:00:54] beautiful part it's not optional that's
[1:00:56] where I want to get to with that tonight
[1:00:57] is not that we're going to uh
[1:00:59] potentially have a partial relation it's
[1:01:03] going to be the full deal it has to be
[1:01:05] the full deal it has to be Christ in us
[1:01:07] and and there's a few interesting quotes
[1:01:09] that I found but you know we we've
[1:01:11] talked about our position and uh
[1:01:13] understanding that we we have been given
[1:01:16] very specific directions in the word of
[1:01:18] God how to be a husband and we've had it
[1:01:21] magnified Amplified broken down in many
[1:01:24] different ways by the prophet of God how
[1:01:26] to be a wife how to be children how to
[1:01:28] be brothers and sisters Elders in the
[1:01:31] church spiritual offices all of these
[1:01:33] things have been talked about in the
[1:01:34] word of God and then magnified Amplified
[1:01:37] explained by the prophet in our day so
[1:01:40] we really don't have any questions about
[1:01:42] we shouldn't have any questions about
[1:01:44] the way things are and if we do have a
[1:01:46] question about the Bible there is a
[1:01:48] Bible answer that's the one thing that
[1:01:49] brother Branham brought out real clear
[1:01:51] for us if there is a Biblical question
[1:01:53] if there is a spiritual question there
[1:01:55] is a Biblical or spiritual answer for us
[1:01:58] we don't have to wander around we don't
[1:02:00] have to bumble around in darkness now
[1:02:02] because all of the Loose Ends have been
[1:02:04] tied up in our day
[1:02:06] but you know in order for us to be able
[1:02:08] to to live our lives like this in order
[1:02:10] for us to find our position as a husband
[1:02:13] as a wife as a child specifically in the
[1:02:16] family unit the only way we're going to
[1:02:18] be able to take these words out of
[1:02:19] Ephesians and and and I believe it's
[1:02:22] Colossians and out of First Peter and
[1:02:24] all of the word in the Bible that
[1:02:26] pertains to Family Positions the only
[1:02:28] way it's going to happen is that for it
[1:02:29] to be a revelation to us there comes a
[1:02:32] point in time where we have to say as we
[1:02:33] just said a minute or ago it's no longer
[1:02:36] our faith it's it's God's faith living
[1:02:38] out through us
[1:02:41] it has to be our position is a
[1:02:44] revelation and and it might sound funny
[1:02:45] to some but it's true
[1:02:47] the battle says when when the Great
[1:02:50] Ransom body through all the ages comes
[1:02:53] up then that's going to be a great
[1:02:54] Throne there Revelation 7 express it
[1:02:57] great number which no man could number
[1:02:59] through all the ages has come up them
[1:03:01] that's walked in the light of the Bible
[1:03:04] as far as it was revealed to them and
[1:03:06] and now we know that Wesley had more
[1:03:09] light than Luther did and we know
[1:03:11] Pentecost outshine Wesley see certainly
[1:03:15] does now where do we stand brothers and
[1:03:17] sisters if we've had all the loose ends
[1:03:20] tied up for us if we've had all the
[1:03:22] Mysteries revealed if if this mystery is
[1:03:25] history now that this is a great mystery
[1:03:27] but I speak concerning Christ in the
[1:03:29] church how much responsibility is on us
[1:03:33] how much light do we have
[1:03:36] I think it's beautiful
[1:03:38] it's amazing when we think about it
[1:03:40] because it's not something that we're
[1:03:42] going to be able to just study and learn
[1:03:43] it's got to be a revelation when we get
[1:03:45] that Revelation I just personally
[1:03:47] believe this when we get that Revelation
[1:03:49] about all of the mystery being history
[1:03:51] and that we know who we are and what
[1:03:54] we're raised up for is the original life
[1:03:56] living out through us that we can
[1:03:58] actually recognize this brothers and
[1:03:59] sisters there's no shame in jumping up
[1:04:02] and down there's no shame in shouting or
[1:04:03] running around the building when you
[1:04:05] recognize that you're redeemed that
[1:04:07] you're going to be one of the ones that
[1:04:08] are one of the few that stand in heaven
[1:04:10] and say you know what I know that my
[1:04:13] redeemer lives because I live also and
[1:04:16] all of Heaven is going to be quiet to
[1:04:17] listen to you worship there but you
[1:04:19] don't have to actually wait till you're
[1:04:21] there to show your worship to show your
[1:04:24] appreciation personally I believe when
[1:04:26] we get that real Revelation down in our
[1:04:28] hearts it's going to change the way we
[1:04:30] behave church is not going to be
[1:04:32] something that we just labor into church
[1:04:34] is going to be something we desire to do
[1:04:36] David said I was glad sad when I said
[1:04:40] let's go to the house of the Lord
[1:04:42] something inside him leapt because he
[1:04:44] knew he was going to worship God
[1:04:47] and that's the only way that we're going
[1:04:49] to be able to have one flesh and I can
[1:04:51] see this is going to patch over into it
[1:04:53] I really am studying worship and I want
[1:04:55] to get right into studying worship and
[1:04:58] and really drill down on it brothers and
[1:05:00] sisters and just try and encourage us to
[1:05:02] step out of our shells don't worry about
[1:05:04] what other people are thinking and don't
[1:05:06] worry about traditions and and the way
[1:05:08] things have been in the past because
[1:05:10] we're going over Jordan we're going into
[1:05:13] the promised land and nobody has ever
[1:05:15] gone there before no one in the Gentile
[1:05:17] church has ever taken all of these
[1:05:19] unraveled Mysteries that have been tied
[1:05:22] up in in the age that we live in and
[1:05:24] gone where we're going no one has ever
[1:05:27] done it it's a personal Affair so don't
[1:05:30] worry about getting out of order brother
[1:05:32] Branham says it I didn't bring the quote
[1:05:33] tonight but I'll bring it on Sunday
[1:05:34] brother Branham says I I think it'd be a
[1:05:37] good thing if we would just get out of
[1:05:38] order once in a while so that we could
[1:05:40] actually just let the spirit of God move
[1:05:43] but many times he wants to move and
[1:05:45] we're just too reserved we don't want to
[1:05:47] move we don't want to change what would
[1:05:50] someone think about us if we got up and
[1:05:52] and shouted I I know there's people that
[1:05:54] when when the spirit of God strikes they
[1:05:57] just can't contain themselves
[1:05:59] maybe it sounds like brother Barry's
[1:06:01] just trying to trump it up into a
[1:06:02] Pentecostal slant but if you think about
[1:06:04] it if if if one of those Church ages
[1:06:07] outshine the other one and and the other
[1:06:09] one outshine the other one and here we
[1:06:11] are with all of the Mysteries being made
[1:06:13] known to us what does it do to us when
[1:06:15] we actually get in the presence of the
[1:06:17] Lord brothers and sisters we've said it
[1:06:19] before and I just think it's amazing
[1:06:21] when you look at a hockey game how
[1:06:22] people will jump up out of their seats
[1:06:25] and jump up and down he's getting he's
[1:06:27] on a breakaway he's going in and he's
[1:06:29] going to score a goal oh he didn't score
[1:06:32] a goal and they'll sit back down again
[1:06:33] and then it will go back down to the
[1:06:35] other end and then it'll start winding
[1:06:36] up and then suddenly it'll be he's
[1:06:38] scarred and then everybody jumps up and
[1:06:40] they make so much noise over a stupid
[1:06:43] piece of rubber
[1:06:45] on ice
[1:06:47] while they're drinking listening to
[1:06:50] Metallica
[1:06:52] but the Church of the Living God can get
[1:06:55] together and worship in spirit and in
[1:06:58] truth
[1:07:00] I think it's so beautiful because I'm
[1:07:02] going to get some of those diagrams that
[1:07:04] Brothers brought you know what we have
[1:07:06] the body and we have the spirit and we
[1:07:08] have the soul we're going when you're
[1:07:10] worshiping in spirit and in truth you're
[1:07:12] actually on the inside of that outside
[1:07:14] realm oh you're not worshiping brothers
[1:07:16] and sisters now we might have a
[1:07:18] discussion afterwards but you know what
[1:07:20] it's got to be that way we've got to
[1:07:22] Worship in spirit or truth and if we're
[1:07:24] not worshiping that way we're not truly
[1:07:26] worshiping God
[1:07:27] you know brother Branham says it that
[1:07:29] millions and billions of people will be
[1:07:31] worshiping but they're going to be
[1:07:32] worshiping Satan and not even knowing it
[1:07:34] and knoweth it not they don't understand
[1:07:38] I just think it's an amazing thing
[1:07:40] though to realize the magnitude of what
[1:07:42] we have what we know
[1:07:45] and not to say who we are because it's
[1:07:48] not something we want to say I'm
[1:07:50] somebody because I've got no we're
[1:07:52] nobody we recognize how little we really
[1:07:55] are by the more revelation we get the
[1:07:58] more revelation we get the smaller we
[1:08:00] become because we recognize there's
[1:08:02] nothing we could do to Merit his grace
[1:08:05] wow
[1:08:07] brother random says because it just
[1:08:09] gradually let loose as it did down
[1:08:10] through the prophets and so forth till
[1:08:12] it was perfectly made known the godhead
[1:08:15] bodily in Christ
[1:08:18] and now Christ in the church is just
[1:08:20] being made known
[1:08:23] the whole thing
[1:08:25] is the revelation of God to take Eve
[1:08:29] back to her right position again with
[1:08:33] her husband
[1:08:35] I just love this this is right where
[1:08:38] we're living brothers and sisters
[1:08:39] because we know Eve isn't on Earth
[1:08:42] right he she's not here on Earth and he
[1:08:45] didn't come down in the garden and take
[1:08:47] her back so so what's he saying here
[1:08:49] he's saying there's going to be a
[1:08:52] physical
[1:08:53] manifestation of the spirit of God where
[1:08:56] he's taking his bride back to his side
[1:09:00] and now Christ in the church is just
[1:09:02] being made known the whole thing is a
[1:09:04] revelation of God to take Eve back to
[1:09:07] her right position again with her
[1:09:10] husband notice and God is the husband of
[1:09:14] the church
[1:09:15] and the church is his bride this is
[1:09:18] Christ The Mystery of God revealed 1963.
[1:09:22] I just was thinking while I was thinking
[1:09:24] and uh you know sometimes it's good to
[1:09:28] have just a little comparison sometimes
[1:09:29] a little bit of a type or an explanation
[1:09:31] and you know sometimes when you have a
[1:09:34] job
[1:09:36] an employer
[1:09:37] can actually give you your job
[1:09:40] description and and you can have your
[1:09:42] job description and you can read it you
[1:09:45] can be trained in a field and and you
[1:09:47] can have the job that matches what
[1:09:50] you're supposed to do and and you can
[1:09:52] read their job description every job
[1:09:54] description is going to be just a little
[1:09:55] bit different because of the way every
[1:09:57] single company operates but there's
[1:09:59] going to be certain things inside that
[1:10:01] job description that matches what you're
[1:10:03] trained to do
[1:10:04] most of the time
[1:10:06] but when an employer explains a job to
[1:10:09] the employee
[1:10:11] it's simply text it's an explanation and
[1:10:14] and the employee can do the job to the
[1:10:18] best of their ability according to what
[1:10:20] is is written in the job description and
[1:10:22] what was explained to them
[1:10:24] and the first little while when you
[1:10:27] start the job and you work at it you you
[1:10:29] work according to what was described to
[1:10:32] you and maybe what the what the
[1:10:34] requirements are for that position
[1:10:37] but then after a little bit of time goes
[1:10:40] by
[1:10:40] you start to actually see how you need
[1:10:44] to do things a little bit here and a
[1:10:47] little bit here and a little bit here
[1:10:49] that don't actually they're not written
[1:10:52] in the job description
[1:10:54] fill in the blanks is kind of what I was
[1:10:56] thinking as I was talking about it and
[1:10:58] we've had discussions about it before
[1:10:59] there's certain gray areas sometimes in
[1:11:01] companies and small companies tend to
[1:11:03] have more gray areas than larger
[1:11:06] companies where there's more people to
[1:11:07] do the work but you wind up actually
[1:11:09] getting what I was thinking today is a
[1:11:11] bit of a revelation about your position
[1:11:14] in the company and when you get that
[1:11:16] Revelation in your position you can
[1:11:19] actually become happy in your position
[1:11:21] because you know the things that need to
[1:11:23] be done according to the job description
[1:11:25] and you know what other things need to
[1:11:27] be done to help you do that that aren't
[1:11:29] written in the job description and you
[1:11:31] just go about it because you have that
[1:11:33] Revelation about how to make it happen
[1:11:35] how to make it flow and usually when you
[1:11:38] get that Revelation about your position
[1:11:39] you can make it easier on other people
[1:11:43] other people's lives become easier and
[1:11:45] what happens is the employer can say wow
[1:11:49] look at this person look at what they're
[1:11:51] doing and then the employer will say you
[1:11:52] know what I don't think I pay you enough
[1:11:54] because I know you're doing more than
[1:11:56] what I've asked you to do
[1:11:58] but imagine how you can take that
[1:11:59] analogy that comparison brothers and
[1:12:01] sisters and put it into the family unit
[1:12:04] as a husband as a wife as a child the
[1:12:07] word of God gives us just a baseline of
[1:12:10] what we should do and and if that's how
[1:12:12] we live our lives and our families as
[1:12:14] just the Baseline that's all I do
[1:12:16] because that's what the word of God says
[1:12:18] then maybe we're letting things slip
[1:12:19] through the cracks maybe we're not
[1:12:21] making it a an easy time for the other
[1:12:24] people in the company
[1:12:26] so to speak
[1:12:28] but imagine if we just did a little bit
[1:12:30] more if we just look for those gray
[1:12:32] areas in our family and thought you know
[1:12:34] what I'm meeting the requirements
[1:12:35] according to the word but I know it's
[1:12:37] going to make my wife just that much
[1:12:39] happier if I just do a little bit more I
[1:12:41] know that she's supposed to look after
[1:12:42] the house and keep the family and and do
[1:12:44] all of that but what if I just did a
[1:12:45] little bit more secretly without even
[1:12:47] telling her
[1:12:48] or what if the wife did something for
[1:12:50] the husband and what if the children did
[1:12:52] something for the parents
[1:12:54] what if the brother did something for
[1:12:55] the sister we know the word of God says
[1:12:57] not to let the right hand know the left
[1:12:59] hand's doing
[1:13:01] sometimes we have the ability to
[1:13:04] actually go beyond just the mechanical
[1:13:05] and just keeping it mechanical
[1:13:07] mechanical mechanical mechanical when
[1:13:09] the Dynamics set in I believe we have
[1:13:11] the opportunity to make something really
[1:13:13] happen something really change and you
[1:13:16] know I just was thinking about it today
[1:13:17] if we could actually get that Dynamics
[1:13:20] and not just say let's have the Dynamics
[1:13:21] in church every time we come to service
[1:13:23] let's get the mechanics and the Dynamics
[1:13:25] together what about getting the
[1:13:26] mechanics and the Dynamics together in
[1:13:27] our positions and our families
[1:13:30] as a husband as a wife as the children
[1:13:33] to think about it as parents you know
[1:13:35] maybe I don't need to spend that much
[1:13:37] time away maybe I could actually just
[1:13:40] take another minute or two with the
[1:13:42] children you know as a child I think
[1:13:44] back in my life there's times where
[1:13:46] someone
[1:13:47] um I had an aunt I'll give you an actual
[1:13:49] example I had an aunt and and she had a
[1:13:52] boyfriend and he had this little car it
[1:13:53] was an MJB and it was a convertible it
[1:13:56] was a two-seater car and and that guy
[1:13:59] his name was rich and he came and he
[1:14:03] picked me up from school he picked me up
[1:14:04] at lunch time took me to McDonald's and
[1:14:06] then took me back to school and for him
[1:14:08] it was probably just like yeah whatever
[1:14:09] this little kid my you know his
[1:14:12] girlfriend's nephew and uh you know it
[1:14:15] was just one time one hour but you know
[1:14:17] that one time that one hour here I am 45
[1:14:20] years later still talking about it it's
[1:14:23] amazing what we can do with just a tiny
[1:14:25] little bit of effort is what I'm trying
[1:14:27] to get at brothers and sisters I'm not
[1:14:29] saying we don't I just was these are
[1:14:31] just thoughts while I was thinking
[1:14:33] that's all things just come to me and I
[1:14:35] was just just contemplating it how
[1:14:37] incredible it can be if we just go
[1:14:40] beyond looking at it as just black and
[1:14:42] white text and this is our job
[1:14:43] description and this is the way we do it
[1:14:45] if we can actually just go a little bit
[1:14:47] further and try a little harder maybe do
[1:14:49] a little more we might see a little bit
[1:14:52] of a difference and that spills right
[1:14:53] over into church right over into church
[1:14:56] services that spills right over into our
[1:14:58] jobs
[1:15:00] right into our jobs I was talking to
[1:15:02] someone on the weekend who works for the
[1:15:03] City of Calgary and they're talking
[1:15:04] about being in the union and and and how
[1:15:07] there's so much wastage and and you went
[1:15:11] on and on and on I don't need to bore
[1:15:13] you with the details but I just I just
[1:15:15] thought how people work to rule and and
[1:15:18] and and just to the letter of of what's
[1:15:20] written there in the job description and
[1:15:22] they do no more nothing more and and
[1:15:25] it's kind of sad because it winds up
[1:15:27] being a financial waste but what about
[1:15:29] the time that we have on Earth
[1:15:31] it doesn't compare money can never
[1:15:34] compare to the time that we have with
[1:15:36] our family
[1:15:37] with our wives with our children we
[1:15:39] don't know what tomorrow holds
[1:15:41] you know brother Branham says it talking
[1:15:43] about Revelation he says the new birth
[1:15:46] is Christ
[1:15:47] is a revelation God has revealed to you
[1:15:52] this great mystery
[1:15:55] and that's a new birth
[1:15:57] and I just can't help but think brothers
[1:15:58] and sisters we know this comes out of
[1:16:00] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:16:02] but this dovetails with this scripture
[1:16:05] in Ephesians chapter 31 many times we
[1:16:07] look at it and say well this is exactly
[1:16:09] what we would say at a at a wedding
[1:16:11] because it's exactly what happens when
[1:16:13] the husband and the wife they they come
[1:16:15] together they have a relationship and
[1:16:17] then they have a child and and the two
[1:16:18] become one they both are represented in
[1:16:21] that child and and that's the way it is
[1:16:24] God wanted it that way because it was
[1:16:26] exactly what he wanted to do from the
[1:16:28] very beginning with his bride
[1:16:32] but this scripture here dovetails with
[1:16:35] this message quote here
[1:16:38] verse 31 for this cause shall a man
[1:16:40] leave his father and mother and shall be
[1:16:43] joined unto his wife and they too shall
[1:16:45] be one flesh this is a great mystery
[1:16:49] but I speak concerning Christ in the
[1:16:51] church I don't speak concerning a man
[1:16:54] and a wife I speak concerning Christ in
[1:16:56] the church but we know that this
[1:16:58] scripture was laying there for thousands
[1:17:01] of years for something yet to come and
[1:17:03] you know brothers and sisters we know we
[1:17:06] know that here we are we know that this
[1:17:09] is the day the Lord hath made this is
[1:17:11] the time for the bride to unite with
[1:17:14] Christ
[1:17:17] it's going to happen sometime out there
[1:17:18] maybe in a little bit of a different way
[1:17:20] but you know what brothers and sisters
[1:17:22] the more we talk about it I think the
[1:17:24] more it actually happens the more we
[1:17:26] recognize it the more it becomes a
[1:17:28] revelation the more that Dynamic can
[1:17:30] actually come upon the mechanic and the
[1:17:33] more we begin to recognize who we are
[1:17:35] there's so many symbolism uh so many
[1:17:39] types in the message of the hour that
[1:17:41] brother Branham talks about recognizing
[1:17:43] your position recognizing what God is
[1:17:46] actually doing but you know brother
[1:17:48] Branham he very carefully doesn't come
[1:17:50] right out and say it all the time
[1:17:53] he talks around it because it's not yet
[1:17:56] time and that's why the seventh seal was
[1:17:59] preached the way it was he got so far
[1:18:01] and the angel of the Lord told him stop
[1:18:03] don't go any further if you go any
[1:18:06] further it's going to actually not be
[1:18:08] timed because there's still people to
[1:18:10] come in you're going to actually cause
[1:18:12] the Rapture of the of the church there's
[1:18:14] still things that need to happen he was
[1:18:16] told to stop but
[1:18:18] in future preaching he explained it he
[1:18:21] explains it very well
[1:18:23] but you know brothers and sisters are
[1:18:25] true blessings
[1:18:27] they lie in us being in our position
[1:18:30] and being outside of our position we rob
[1:18:32] ourselves of our blessings
[1:18:36] and and I just wanted to say just like
[1:18:39] Harmony in the home it's like
[1:18:42] harmony with Christ
[1:18:45] because when we've got harmony with
[1:18:46] Christ we know that he's going to look
[1:18:48] after us and we know that he's going to
[1:18:51] lead us and we know that he's going to
[1:18:53] guide us
[1:18:55] but only if we're willing to let them
[1:19:00] sometimes in a marriage
[1:19:03] we can see
[1:19:05] it difficult for that to happen
[1:19:07] for many different reasons
[1:19:10] but we have to be able to trust
[1:19:13] we absolutely have to be able to trust
[1:19:14] and if we can trust
[1:19:16] then we can be in our positions we have
[1:19:19] to be willing to trust our husbands
[1:19:22] our husbands have to be willing to trust
[1:19:25] God
[1:19:26] and our children need to be able to
[1:19:27] trust our parents
[1:19:29] and and if we can't do that it becomes a
[1:19:33] very tragic situation
[1:19:36] you know Eve I think it was so good I
[1:19:38] think it was brother Mervin that brought
[1:19:39] it out
[1:19:40] over the the weekend boy the meetings
[1:19:43] last week were fantastic
[1:19:46] so good
[1:19:47] Eve
[1:19:49] she had her position and her husband
[1:19:52] and we know that God actually did the
[1:19:54] operation
[1:19:55] no I think it was brother Gilbert that
[1:19:57] brought it by cesarean he said the first
[1:20:00] operation the first Caesarean happened
[1:20:01] God took Eve out of Adam
[1:20:06] and when she was in Adam she was
[1:20:09] completely safe
[1:20:10] when she was in her husband
[1:20:13] Satan couldn't touch her
[1:20:14] because Satan had to get through the
[1:20:16] husband
[1:20:18] and you know as husbands and wives in
[1:20:21] this life
[1:20:22] as a husband
[1:20:24] if I'm in Christ
[1:20:26] then Satan can't get at my family
[1:20:29] unless he goes through Christ first
[1:20:32] but if I get outside of God look out
[1:20:36] that's where all manner of trouble can
[1:20:39] come on the scene
[1:20:40] but as long as Eve was in her husband
[1:20:41] she could not fall at all there was no
[1:20:44] way Satan could do it because he was a
[1:20:46] Son of God right
[1:20:48] but it's one she was separated that's
[1:20:50] when Satan came around why did he do
[1:20:53] that we know that God created him to be
[1:20:55] that way but he did it that way because
[1:20:57] he's a coward
[1:20:58] let's let's let's label him as he is
[1:21:02] that's why he did it that way because he
[1:21:04] knew that when she was separated that's
[1:21:05] when he could get at her
[1:21:09] but as long as she obeyed the word of
[1:21:10] God
[1:21:11] I think this is such an interesting
[1:21:13] discussion as long as she obeyed the
[1:21:15] word of God
[1:21:17] on her husband's lips
[1:21:20] she was okay even when she was separated
[1:21:22] from him
[1:21:24] and isn't it interesting because he
[1:21:27] didn't say it doesn't say in the word of
[1:21:28] God that Adam said to Eve don't eat of
[1:21:31] that fruit
[1:21:33] we're okay to eat everything in the
[1:21:34] garden honey but just don't touch that
[1:21:36] one let's not do that let's not eat from
[1:21:39] that tree
[1:21:41] the word of God says that he told Adam
[1:21:43] God told Adam when they were yet one
[1:21:47] so she knew it she had to know it it was
[1:21:50] already there but as long as she obeyed
[1:21:52] her husband's voice God in her husband
[1:21:55] she was still okay outside but as soon
[1:21:58] as she stepped out from the instructions
[1:22:00] of her husband
[1:22:02] she was doomed they they they could not
[1:22:06] fall so long as they followed the word
[1:22:07] of God
[1:22:09] I just think it's a beautiful thing when
[1:22:11] we when we look at this and recognize
[1:22:13] that this great mystery is speaking
[1:22:15] concerning Christ in the church and we
[1:22:17] know this is the day for that to happen
[1:22:20] brothers and sisters this is the day of
[1:22:22] recognizing that we're crossing over
[1:22:24] Jordan any day now we're going to see
[1:22:26] The Rapture of the church
[1:22:29] you know I just got into questions and
[1:22:31] answers this week and and I came across
[1:22:33] this and I just I had to stop and Rewind
[1:22:35] and play and stop and Rewind and play
[1:22:38] and think am I am I actually hearing
[1:22:40] this the way that brother Branham is
[1:22:41] saying it
[1:22:43] this is uh paragraph 329 out of
[1:22:45] questions and answers 1964.
[1:22:48] it says please explain people are saying
[1:22:50] brother Branham is more than a man
[1:22:53] he can create
[1:22:54] and Jesus
[1:22:56] can look just like brother Branham
[1:23:00] this is another point that uh brother
[1:23:02] Mervin brought out
[1:23:03] um months ago and I just think it's so
[1:23:05] beautiful brother Branham actually says
[1:23:06] it here I don't know if you brought that
[1:23:08] out if you brought this quote brother
[1:23:09] brother Mervin but uh he just says it so
[1:23:12] clearly you know when Christ was on
[1:23:14] Earth he created fish from Fish and
[1:23:16] bread from bread
[1:23:18] but where did those squirrels come from
[1:23:21] brother Branham says it here in this
[1:23:23] message
[1:23:25] but I'll just read this quote here that
[1:23:26] was just uh for free please explain
[1:23:29] people are saying brother Branham is
[1:23:30] more than a man he can create and Jesus
[1:23:34] can look just like brother Branham he
[1:23:37] says now let me the person said this
[1:23:39] whoever it might be I don't know but I
[1:23:41] am your brother see Jesus is your savior
[1:23:45] I cannot be your savior for he has
[1:23:49] already saved you
[1:23:52] and we know before the seals were open
[1:23:55] the Antichrist Spirit got in there that
[1:23:57] deity spirit and tried to make brother
[1:23:59] Branham
[1:24:01] Christ
[1:24:02] tried to label him that way and we know
[1:24:05] that he was faced with that same thing
[1:24:06] that Jesus was faced with when he was
[1:24:08] out in the desert he could have accepted
[1:24:09] it and said yeah sure
[1:24:12] that's cool and kept going but because
[1:24:14] he believed because he was who he was he
[1:24:17] was a true servant of the Living God he
[1:24:20] couldn't accept it and he said you know
[1:24:21] what you're going to make me Antichrist
[1:24:22] and there's no way that I can go forth
[1:24:24] with my Ministry so I'm going to pull
[1:24:25] myself off the scene if that's the way
[1:24:26] you're going to behave until we get this
[1:24:28] straightened out and he did and he
[1:24:30] straightened it up and then he went
[1:24:31] forward and preached the seals isn't it
[1:24:33] interesting how God would not let the
[1:24:35] seals be unraveled Unwound in error it
[1:24:38] had to be truth
[1:24:41] he says he has already saved you
[1:24:44] now you're so close to being the truth
[1:24:48] there
[1:24:49] and yet so far from the truth
[1:24:52] the person that told this person this he
[1:24:55] says now it's just a looks to me like
[1:24:59] it's a woman's handwriting very
[1:25:01] beautiful handwriting and I'd say that's
[1:25:02] a woman's handwriting wouldn't you
[1:25:04] brother Capps wouldn't you think that's
[1:25:05] a woman's handwrite a pretty handwrite
[1:25:07] and I don't know who it is see
[1:25:10] now brother Branham could Jesus look
[1:25:12] like you or you be Jesus or something
[1:25:15] like that
[1:25:17] I like I said I had to rewind fast
[1:25:20] forward
[1:25:21] um or rewind and play he says one sense
[1:25:23] of the word
[1:25:25] sorry I'll just read it again now
[1:25:27] brother Branham could Jesus look like
[1:25:29] you or you be Jesus or something like
[1:25:33] that
[1:25:35] one sense of the word that's exactly
[1:25:37] truth
[1:25:39] another sense of the word it's
[1:25:40] Antichrist
[1:25:42] that's the difference between right and
[1:25:44] wrong to make me the person of the Lord
[1:25:46] Jesus Christ would be an antichrist see
[1:25:48] for that person of the Lord Jesus is
[1:25:50] sitting at the right hand of the Majesty
[1:25:52] on high and will come again in great
[1:25:53] power and Glory
[1:25:55] but for his life that was in him being
[1:25:59] upon me and upon you who have him it's
[1:26:03] exactly the truth
[1:26:06] and you become Christ
[1:26:09] you don't become like Christ
[1:26:12] you become Christ
[1:26:16] so brothers and sisters I want to say to
[1:26:17] us tonight don't don't don't don't
[1:26:19] stumble at the badger skin
[1:26:21] don't look at your brother and sister
[1:26:22] and think oh that brother said this or
[1:26:24] that sister said that I'll say it all
[1:26:26] the time don't look at the badger skin
[1:26:27] don't do it because you're going to
[1:26:29] stumble and fall look at the word inside
[1:26:32] that Badger skin give it the word test
[1:26:35] brother Branham said if you can actually
[1:26:37] give it the word test and see a response
[1:26:39] according to the word then guess what
[1:26:41] that's Christ
[1:26:43] I know that's bizarre but brothers and
[1:26:46] sisters if you're looking for the word
[1:26:47] you're going to find the word
[1:26:50] and one day it's going to be that way I
[1:26:54] think we're going to say that when we
[1:26:55] look for the word in our brother and our
[1:26:57] sister and we say when we see that word
[1:26:59] in our brother and our sister and we can
[1:27:01] say that's Christ
[1:27:03] there's going to be a shout in the camp
[1:27:05] because it's a revelation it's not
[1:27:07] something that we can just say you know
[1:27:09] someone's going to tell you you're going
[1:27:10] to put it in your pocket and you get it
[1:27:12] and you're going to just be fine like
[1:27:13] that no it's got to be revealed to us
[1:27:15] individually that that new birth makes
[1:27:18] us one flesh not with our husband and
[1:27:21] our wife because Paul said I speak
[1:27:23] concerning a great mystery and that
[1:27:24] mystery is Christ in the church
[1:27:27] I no longer call you servants I call you
[1:27:30] friends
[1:27:31] I no longer call you church or friends
[1:27:35] but I call you bride
[1:27:37] so that you'll understand right but then
[1:27:40] we know it goes from bride to wife
[1:27:42] there's a transition happening and
[1:27:44] brothers and sisters we're right in that
[1:27:46] spot right now where we're going from
[1:27:48] bride to wife
[1:27:51] but it's a revelation
[1:27:54] Saint John 10 30 has to be
[1:27:58] for those who don't know it it's I am my
[1:28:00] father are one
[1:28:01] a real simple verse
[1:28:04] Saint John 10 30 I and my father are one
[1:28:07] and you know I think as the Devil comes
[1:28:10] around and starts talking to us and
[1:28:12] taunting us and poking at us and says
[1:28:14] well why would you do that why would you
[1:28:16] say that why would you think that why
[1:28:17] would you go there why would you have
[1:28:19] said that why would you have acted that
[1:28:21] way why would all of that have happened
[1:28:22] if you were Christ if you were God
[1:28:26] just keep saying it I am my father are
[1:28:28] one
[1:28:29] that's what the word of God says
[1:28:31] it doesn't matter
[1:28:32] you know I think it's interesting
[1:28:34] because we can look at I've got a bunch
[1:28:36] of notes here and I don't think I'll be
[1:28:37] able to get into it tonight but it's got
[1:28:40] to be this great mystery revealed to us
[1:28:43] individually
[1:28:44] Paul's fate concerning Christ and his
[1:28:47] church
[1:28:50] I just love it how he said that I no
[1:28:52] longer call you servants
[1:28:55] you know brother uh I think it was
[1:28:57] brother Gilbert as well that brought
[1:28:58] this out he said you know it's out of
[1:29:00] the Easter seal
[1:29:02] we've got to be able to tell
[1:29:04] we've got to be able to show and we've
[1:29:06] got to be able to prove
[1:29:08] the life that we're living that we're
[1:29:10] Believers that we believe the message of
[1:29:12] the hour and and I think that when it
[1:29:15] comes to telling and showing it can be
[1:29:17] pretty easy to do relatively speaking
[1:29:20] because we can tell people that we've
[1:29:22] been saved we can tell people that God
[1:29:23] sent a prophet we can tell people that
[1:29:25] we attend a church we can tell people
[1:29:26] that you know God's done certain things
[1:29:28] for us in our lives then we can show all
[1:29:31] kinds of quotes we can show all manner
[1:29:34] of scriptures that have been revealed to
[1:29:36] us we can show friends and family that
[1:29:39] believe this message of the hour we can
[1:29:41] tell and show a lot
[1:29:43] but how do we prove it
[1:29:46] how do we prove it brothers and sisters
[1:29:48] this is where the rubber meets the road
[1:29:50] or the brass tacks or the hard part of
[1:29:52] the conversation and this is just what
[1:29:54] the Lord I think is showing me and I'm
[1:29:56] certainly open to conversation about it
[1:29:58] but I believe it with all my heart
[1:29:59] brothers and sisters the tell and the
[1:30:01] show is pretty easy but the proof is a
[1:30:04] little bit more difficult but that proof
[1:30:06] is in our lives it's in the lives that
[1:30:08] we live it's in the examples that we
[1:30:10] show to all of the people around us and
[1:30:12] we can have like we've said many times a
[1:30:14] really good church attendance and really
[1:30:16] good polished behavior in church and we
[1:30:19] can tell and we can show but who are we
[1:30:21] with our family
[1:30:24] who are we with our enemies I think
[1:30:26] brother Gilbert says it all the time
[1:30:27] would our enemies have a good report of
[1:30:29] us in our lives
[1:30:30] the people that don't believe that work
[1:30:32] around us that work with us would they
[1:30:34] be able to say
[1:30:36] that's a believer
[1:30:38] and this questions and answers brother
[1:30:39] Bradham talks about the story about how
[1:30:42] there's the guys down at the bar the
[1:30:43] drunks they're there at the at the bar
[1:30:45] and he names the bar and names that the
[1:30:47] bar was renamed and knows exactly where
[1:30:49] it's at and and who is in there he tells
[1:30:52] it very clearly but then he says they're
[1:30:54] having a conversation in there and they
[1:30:55] start talking about the holy rollers and
[1:30:57] they say there's no such thing as a real
[1:30:58] Christian on earth now and they're all
[1:31:00] drunk talking about this I've I've
[1:31:02] experienced it brothers and sisters
[1:31:03] people love to get theological with
[1:31:06] alcohol it's bizarre but it's true and
[1:31:09] you know they're having this
[1:31:10] conversation in the bar whooping it up
[1:31:12] saying there's no such thing as a real
[1:31:13] Christian and there's one guy even even
[1:31:15] in the midst of being drunk he says oh
[1:31:17] no no no no there is I I know there is
[1:31:20] and I can show you I'll prove it to you
[1:31:22] come back to my house and he gives that
[1:31:25] example about how he treated his wife
[1:31:27] terrible
[1:31:28] and you know
[1:31:30] I wouldn't doubt that that that man call
[1:31:33] him a brother that that man he was used
[1:31:35] to that behavior
[1:31:37] he was used to treating his wife like a
[1:31:39] doormat treating her terrible like that
[1:31:41] he was used to it and so was she
[1:31:44] but you know there was a difference
[1:31:45] between the two of them he wasn't
[1:31:47] converted but she was
[1:31:50] and what happened they go back and and
[1:31:52] he said come on I'll show you we'll go
[1:31:54] back and we'll get drunk and we'll go
[1:31:55] back and and I'll show you that she's a
[1:31:57] real Christian and fix us some eggs
[1:31:59] honey and and when she did she made them
[1:32:01] all eggs I couldn't imagine that coming
[1:32:03] back after hours and just demanding that
[1:32:05] the wife would do all that but anyways
[1:32:07] they did and the wife fixed the eggs and
[1:32:09] what does he do he throws it on the
[1:32:11] floor and says that's garbage I can't
[1:32:12] believe you would do that you would make
[1:32:14] my eggs that way it's not the way I like
[1:32:15] them blah blah blah smash it on the
[1:32:17] floor and what did she do
[1:32:20] she just cleaned it up
[1:32:22] she started singing
[1:32:24] she started singing in her heart and
[1:32:26] expressing the life that was inside her
[1:32:27] don't worry honey I'll fix it for you
[1:32:29] I'll make it better for you honey
[1:32:31] because I love you don't worry I'll just
[1:32:33] make it better
[1:32:35] and she could have kicked him
[1:32:37] could have kicked him out said you're
[1:32:39] drunk you skunk get out of here but she
[1:32:42] didn't she expressed that life she was
[1:32:43] proving that life
[1:32:46] she didn't have to she didn't have to
[1:32:48] tell she didn't have to show because he
[1:32:50] did all of that and all she had to do
[1:32:52] was just be who she was she just had to
[1:32:54] live her life and by living her life she
[1:32:57] proved that there was truly christ-like
[1:33:00] people on Earth there truly was a
[1:33:02] representation of Christ Living out
[1:33:05] but to tell and show and prove it's got
[1:33:07] to be more than just telling someone
[1:33:08] it's got to be more than just telling
[1:33:10] and showing it's got to be more than
[1:33:12] Church quotes and church attendance and
[1:33:13] good dress and nice people
[1:33:16] I want to say this brothers and sisters
[1:33:18] we've got to be able to prove it
[1:33:21] we can show and tell all we want
[1:33:25] this is just just kind of fresh and I
[1:33:28] pray that you'd forgive me for it but
[1:33:29] you know
[1:33:31] elementary students have show and tell
[1:33:35] not mature Christians
[1:33:37] mature Christians just live their lives
[1:33:40] and by doing that they prove it they
[1:33:43] prove it to their children they prove it
[1:33:44] to their wives they prove it to their
[1:33:45] husbands they prove it to their brothers
[1:33:47] and sisters
[1:33:49] things don't flustrate them
[1:33:51] would you imagine that how many people
[1:33:52] will tolerate that a man just smashing
[1:33:54] his plate on the floor and saying that's
[1:33:55] garbage I can't believe you would do
[1:33:57] that
[1:33:58] can you imagine
[1:34:00] sometimes if the music is a little bit
[1:34:02] too loud in church people get upset
[1:34:03] sometimes if somebody sings the same
[1:34:05] song Too Much somebody gets upset
[1:34:07] sometimes if somebody doesn't shake your
[1:34:09] hand at the door somebody could get
[1:34:10] upset how many different little things
[1:34:12] can actually get us upset brothers and
[1:34:13] sisters are we mature Sons and Daughters
[1:34:16] of God are we there do our lives prove
[1:34:19] Who We Are
[1:34:21] how we conduct ourselves and our
[1:34:23] positions brothers and sisters I believe
[1:34:24] it proves that we recognize this great
[1:34:27] mystery it proves that we understand
[1:34:30] about one flesh
[1:34:34] you know
[1:34:35] um some of the study that I got into was
[1:34:37] talking about having having maybe having
[1:34:39] a temper and and getting upset and all
[1:34:42] the different things that can happen and
[1:34:43] you know we can cause a nervous
[1:34:45] condition and the people around us by
[1:34:47] having a temper and and it's not going
[1:34:49] to do anybody any good I'm not going to
[1:34:52] go there for time's sake I just want to
[1:34:54] encourage us brothers and sisters to
[1:34:56] recognize that even if we have a temper
[1:34:57] even if we have a situation in our lives
[1:35:00] where maybe it's just us in our flesh
[1:35:02] and we just don't know how to tame it
[1:35:04] because we can be good for weeks and
[1:35:06] months and then all of a sudden
[1:35:07] something will happen and snap the
[1:35:09] breaker flips and and we just see a red
[1:35:12] mist and we just go crazy again and turn
[1:35:15] into this person that we hate
[1:35:18] it doesn't mean that we're lost
[1:35:20] and it doesn't mean that we're not saved
[1:35:22] and brother Branham says it I'm just
[1:35:25] going to fast forward to the good stuff
[1:35:27] because I don't I don't want to say bad
[1:35:30] about any of us
[1:35:32] and remember when I talk about this
[1:35:35] stuff it's because I experience it
[1:35:38] I know what it means to have a temper
[1:35:39] and it does us no good
[1:35:44] brother random says this
[1:35:46] now a righteous man
[1:35:49] is not a sinless man
[1:35:51] if you notice he said Elijah was a man
[1:35:55] subject to like passions as we are
[1:35:58] he had his ups and his downs and his
[1:36:00] differences
[1:36:01] and the scripture of his life proves
[1:36:05] that he had his ups and downs like we do
[1:36:07] and he had his times of wandering
[1:36:10] he had his times that his temper got
[1:36:13] away from him
[1:36:14] and what he's referring to there is the
[1:36:16] she bears
[1:36:18] destroying those 42 kids
[1:36:20] that mocked him for not going up in the
[1:36:22] Rapture when his teacher went up
[1:36:27] he had his time
[1:36:29] he said and his times when his temper
[1:36:31] got away from him and there are a lot of
[1:36:33] things that went wrong
[1:36:35] brother Bradham says but he was still a
[1:36:37] righteous man
[1:36:39] because he confessed his unworthiness
[1:36:41] and believed in God
[1:36:44] so that's what made him righteous
[1:36:46] you know brothers and sisters if we can
[1:36:48] do that ourselves just recognize how
[1:36:50] little we really are
[1:36:52] and be willing to confess our faults one
[1:36:54] to another and pray for one another
[1:36:58] that our prayers might be heard and that
[1:37:00] we might be healed if we're willing to
[1:37:01] do that we're going to be proving the
[1:37:04] life that's inside of us
[1:37:07] but if we just hold it back and reserve
[1:37:09] it and say I never did nothing wrong you
[1:37:10] did something wrong
[1:37:12] you need to repent you need to say sorry
[1:37:14] you you you
[1:37:16] when I get anywhere we're still in Show
[1:37:19] and Tell right we still haven't Show and
[1:37:21] Tell with the class we don't want to be
[1:37:23] doing that we want to be proving just
[1:37:24] living our life just like we talked
[1:37:26] about with the the Sheep they just
[1:37:29] produce wool they don't try to produce
[1:37:31] wool
[1:37:32] doves they're just White
[1:37:34] they just are it's because of what's
[1:37:37] inside them it's the oil inside of them
[1:37:39] and I believe that with all my heart
[1:37:41] that we have the oil of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:43] Inside of us and that's why we gather
[1:37:45] together that's why we come to church
[1:37:47] that's why we worship together so that
[1:37:49] we can actually fill our cups that we
[1:37:51] can have the oil we know the difference
[1:37:52] between the virgins the five wise the
[1:37:54] five unwise of both of them had oil
[1:37:57] just that some of them ran out and the
[1:38:00] other ones went in God oil they actually
[1:38:02] made sure they had their oil topped up
[1:38:04] they were trimming their lap they made
[1:38:06] sure that they had it they were taking
[1:38:08] inventory all the time
[1:38:10] but you know he was still a righteous
[1:38:12] man and I want to say that tonight
[1:38:13] brothers and sisters
[1:38:15] just because we have ups and downs in
[1:38:17] our lives it doesn't mean we're not
[1:38:18] righteous it doesn't mean that we're not
[1:38:21] Sons and Daughters of God doesn't mean
[1:38:23] that we're not still currently showing
[1:38:26] and telling and proving Our Lives I
[1:38:29] don't mean to Discount that in any way
[1:38:31] by the way but I just wanted to try and
[1:38:33] magnify that one part if that's all
[1:38:35] we're doing then then we're missing the
[1:38:37] main point the main point is proving our
[1:38:40] lives and not proving our lives but
[1:38:42] proving his life proving that we are one
[1:38:45] the Twain have become one that this
[1:38:47] mystery is no longer a mystery through
[1:38:49] the revealing of the word for our day
[1:38:53] but you know in order to get this
[1:38:54] Revelation that we've talked about it
[1:38:56] takes the Holy Ghost in our lives and
[1:38:58] and and we'll go back to this every
[1:38:59] single time we will it takes the Holy
[1:39:01] Ghost it's got to be a revelation it's
[1:39:03] got to be revealed to us personally we
[1:39:06] heard brother Branham say it earlier
[1:39:08] that's the new birth the new birth is
[1:39:10] Christ but it's not just re realizing
[1:39:13] that God sent a prophet and there's all
[1:39:15] these Mysteries that have been revealed
[1:39:16] and the seals are unraveled and and and
[1:39:18] all of that has happened in our day and
[1:39:21] we can say that it's great it's not that
[1:39:23] it's recognizing that Christ and I are
[1:39:27] one that I invite Christ to come and
[1:39:29] live inside my heart and it's not just
[1:39:31] going to be an oath that I take and a
[1:39:33] badge that I wear it's not it at all
[1:39:35] it's simply that I invite him to be the
[1:39:38] the the life inside of me and and as we
[1:39:41] live our lives that way he will take
[1:39:44] over he will Express his life through us
[1:39:48] but it's not some crazy fundamental
[1:39:50] thing either
[1:39:51] at one time I thought that it was that
[1:39:53] it was something that would be so so
[1:39:55] dramatic and and so maybe legalistic and
[1:39:59] so so strange remember Jesus wasn't
[1:40:02] legalistic at all Jesus was the opposite
[1:40:05] of the law wasn't he even though didn't
[1:40:06] he come to magnify the law oh but what
[1:40:09] law
[1:40:10] not the Commandments of men that they
[1:40:12] were teaching for Doctrine no no no he
[1:40:14] was coming to magnify the Old Testament
[1:40:16] law to say that you know what there will
[1:40:18] be a lamb that will be offered there
[1:40:20] will be one sacrifice that will happen
[1:40:22] for all of sinful men and that's all
[1:40:25] that's going to require and that's why
[1:40:27] we've said it before his very first
[1:40:28] order of business after this last
[1:40:30] weekend that went down when he went to
[1:40:33] the Cross when he finally bowed his head
[1:40:35] and said it's finished and gave up the
[1:40:36] ghost he went directly from the cross
[1:40:38] into the temple and rent that Veil top
[1:40:41] to bottom and and that was to show
[1:40:43] openly that he triumphed over all of his
[1:40:47] enemies that there was no longer any
[1:40:49] separation between God and man
[1:40:52] and that veil has never been put back by
[1:40:55] God man has thoroughly put it back in
[1:40:58] place and we don't want to find
[1:41:00] ourselves with that Veil we don't want
[1:41:01] to be hiding behind a veil we don't want
[1:41:04] to have anything to do with the veil we
[1:41:06] just want to have the Life of Christ
[1:41:07] Living out through us and if we can do
[1:41:10] that brothers and sisters if we can
[1:41:11] formally surrender Our Lives to the Lord
[1:41:15] Jesus Christ in our day fully Embrace
[1:41:18] this word for our day then we will truly
[1:41:21] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[1:41:24] once we do it will become a revelation
[1:41:26] of who we are and when we recognize what
[1:41:28] we are that's what the message of the
[1:41:30] hour says I was going to bring that
[1:41:31] quote it's right after that when he says
[1:41:33] Christ is the new birth
[1:41:35] uh he says when when the bride
[1:41:38] recognizes its position
[1:41:40] what it is then the Rapture will go and
[1:41:43] I don't think we can ever get bored of
[1:41:44] talking about that because that's that's
[1:41:46] our life that's where we stand and and
[1:41:48] that's why I want to try and encourage
[1:41:49] us tonight brothers and sisters as I
[1:41:51] call the musicians to to consider our
[1:41:54] positions consider our positions as
[1:41:57] husbands and wives but now consider our
[1:41:59] positions with Christ to recognize that
[1:42:02] as we
[1:42:04] as we near that headstone
[1:42:06] will be just like him and and I believe
[1:42:10] according to the quote we've read
[1:42:12] tonight that we won't be just like him
[1:42:14] we will be him
[1:42:16] we will be him and we're not going to be
[1:42:18] the Savior that died brother Branham
[1:42:20] said that and I'll just clarify that
[1:42:21] will never be the Savior it's not going
[1:42:24] to be that we're not going to change our
[1:42:26] flesh and and and turn into a different
[1:42:28] human being although all of our
[1:42:31] mannerisms
[1:42:33] will change they'll be altered there
[1:42:35] will be a different you and a different
[1:42:37] me living out through our lives
[1:42:39] and I believe for most of us if not all
[1:42:42] of us it's already taken place we're
[1:42:44] already living a different life we're
[1:42:46] already seeing things in a totally
[1:42:48] different perspective and that's one
[1:42:49] thing that we have talked about it
[1:42:51] living in a message home being raised
[1:42:53] being fed the pure word of God it can be
[1:42:57] so deceiving for Satan to come around
[1:43:00] and say well you never really did have a
[1:43:02] lightning bolt experience it never
[1:43:03] really did change your life entirely but
[1:43:06] something keeps holding you
[1:43:09] as a sister if you wear skirts and you
[1:43:12] want to if you have long hair that's
[1:43:14] never been cut and you want it that way
[1:43:16] what's causing that
[1:43:18] there's something on the inside of the
[1:43:20] inside that's causing that if you have a
[1:43:23] desire to go and now do that differently
[1:43:25] to go wear pants and to to behave
[1:43:28] differently if men have the desire to go
[1:43:30] and and shoot pool in a bar and maybe
[1:43:32] have the odd beer or or go and listen to
[1:43:35] the odd song and and watch the odd thing
[1:43:38] and do all these different things if
[1:43:40] we've got these desires there's still
[1:43:42] some work to do there's still some steps
[1:43:44] to take
[1:43:45] but it doesn't mean we're not righteous
[1:43:48] we're just on our journey maybe stand
[1:43:50] with me tonight as we close
[1:43:52] I just want to encourage us brothers and
[1:43:54] sisters to draw draw nigh unto God and
[1:43:57] He will draw nigh unto you and when we
[1:44:00] draw nigh unto him just think about it
[1:44:03] this great mystery it's that the two
[1:44:06] shall be one flesh that it's going to be
[1:44:10] Christ Living out through his bride body
[1:44:13] the many membered bride body of
[1:44:17] Believers simply taking him had his word
[1:44:20] God bless you tonight let's pray
[1:44:23] gracious Heavenly Father Lord tonight we
[1:44:25] just want to thank you for your goodness
[1:44:27] to us Lord thank you for your words of
[1:44:30] encouragement Lord to recognize that as
[1:44:33] much as we would like to try and and
[1:44:35] prove something Lord we can't do it
[1:44:38] we have to rely on you we have to trust
[1:44:41] in you entirely with our entire being
[1:44:44] Lord Jesus and we know that Satan is
[1:44:47] roaming as a roaring lion father and he
[1:44:50] he desires to devour our families he
[1:44:54] desires to devour our lives he wants to
[1:44:57] destroy our church he wants to destroy
[1:45:00] every single good thing about us but we
[1:45:03] know father you
[1:45:05] your life
[1:45:06] stops him you've said it in your word so
[1:45:10] many different ways that you you would
[1:45:12] simply rebuke the Devourer for our sakes
[1:45:16] and father we're so thankful that we can
[1:45:17] just take you at your word tonight
[1:45:19] Lord we pray that you would just help us

[1:45:30] that position Lord as a as a wife as a

[1:45:37] forwards and if it Be Your Will for us
[1:45:39] to gather again Lord on Sunday
