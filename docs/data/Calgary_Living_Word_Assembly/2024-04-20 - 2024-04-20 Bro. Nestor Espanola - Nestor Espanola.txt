understanding Lord God Amen Lord we thank you Lord Jesus again bless your people and bless Thy Word in Jesus name I pray amen amen so before we seated let's open our Bible in Psalm 127 verse 1 to2 amen Psalm 127 verse 1-2 yeah I want to speak about let us go unto Perfection praise God yeah go on to Perfection yeah okay good says a song of degrees of Solomon except the Lord build a house they labored in vain that built it except the Lord keep the city The Watchman wake it but in vain it is vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat bread of Sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep may the Lord add a blessing from the reading of the scripture you all may be seated amen praise God hallelujah amen there you go that's right amen so the scripture is very clear okay so except the Lord build the house except the Lord who call you see uh what what we did what we are going to do it's all in vain see praise God see like I say you know uh like like same like with the minister if your denomination call you see so definitely that your denomination will support you and you will also preach the teaching of your denomination see then if you call yourself then you will support yourself then you will teach your own teaching praise God but then if God call you definitely he will support you amen see and you will preach what God's want you to preach amen what's the word of God is okay that's why when I go out you know the first time I go into the uh in the ministry I'm already in the mission field see praise God I have no background ground I mean I never went into any Bible school and even when I'm studying in University you know you know in high school we have no religion see I have I know nothing about religion I know that there is God and what the problem where is God Is praise God hallelujah so when he called me into the ministry I only asked him I said Lord if you want me to go in the ministry first you teach me secondly you support me I said to the Lord once my wife and my children complain I will stop see once my children my family got you know hungry I will go out and work I know how to work praise God I've been working since how I'm 15 years old see so when the Lord called me I say uh that's a two thing that I'm required for him to do teach me see praise God then he gave me this scripture okay he said except the Lord build a house they labor in vain say it's all in vain praise God even he said if you rise up early you sit up late you eat the bread of Sorrow it's all in vain but to his beloved he will give them rest see then he said except the Lord keep the city The Watchman Wicked but invade see you know uh if you try to uh um how do you say it praise God uh to protect prot yourself from this false Doctrine or this teaching and this teaching praise God see unless the Lord keep you see even even if you do uh if you work hard even if you do this if you do that everything will be in vain so everything is of the Lord okay praise God see so we have no problem if God call you we we have no problem if God establish you see whatever whatever happened praise God you are standing on the Solid Rock Amen praise God see now it says here praise the Lord this it says in Hebrew chapter 6 verse 1-3 amen see therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go unto Perfection now not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptism and of Li laying of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this we will do if God permit see so there is really you know uh praise God that's why I've been saying now this message is different okay this is not about the justification message this is not the sanctification message nor the baptism of the Holy Ghost message we have more than that okay praise God see and then the prophet said this is a prophetic message praise God see when you say this is a prophetic message praise God it has something to do prophecy has something to do with the events past present and future events then as a Christian praise God Paul said we need to progress praise God see laying aside the basic teaching there is really a basic teaching see that's why Paul said Hallelujah not laying us again the foundation of repentance from dead Works Faith baptism healing resurrection of death and eternal judgment he said you need to go unto Perfection see same thing that's why I've been saying to the people this message is different this is Progressive a lot of things the prophet said during his time but the people can see it yet praise God Amen but in our age we can see it very clear praise the Lord see but it is still in the message amen remember that we cannot go outside the message we cannot go outside the Bible okay praise God but now I just want to speak about you know the let us go unto Perfection okay see we need to go unto Perfection see now the Greek Lexicon praise God hallelujah it says here Perfection came from the Greek word teos see meaning it say of men full grown adult of full age mature see praise God hallelujah so we need to go I mean uh you need we need to be mature right right praise God see I want to share this subject because I want you to I I want uh we need to know the message is uh it's a different okay praise God the message will always tell you what you are praise God in that way you can you can understand where you are see praise God after this uh after this I do believe you will understand where you are okay praise God see Christian are being processed see praise God Hallelujah to the young people then you will understand it okay Hallelujah also to the parents Hallelujah sometimes we love our young uh our young people okay praise God but sometimes they just don't understand what's happening see and I'm I'm always saying most of the young people they are not yet born again see that's a problem with the parents sometimes they are trying to they are asking the children to live a born again life see when they are not yet born again how can you do that see that's why the prophet keep on say how can you draw blood out of the turnip see praise God hallelujah see to the young people I I I'm just always telling them just come to the church listen come to the church listen sit there and listen don't you worry Faith cometh by hearing see praise God hallelujah see so to the parents I've been always telling it to them don't be to legalist you know don't ask a born again life from your children when they are not yet born again see and most of the children 85% are not yet born again they are born in the message through praise God see we discipline them we teach them Hallelujah but unless praise God they be born again Hallelujah all these things are just uh information for them praise God hallelujah amen see praise God but to them that are born in the spirit now you start growing okay and and Paul says you need to go unto Perfection you need to mature praise God see if after 20 years your pastor pastor Barry keep on preaching keep on telling you you need to be Sanctified then there is a problem Hallelujah see Hallelujah you need to go onto Perfection this is laying aside those things good works Faith praise God if up to I if up to now I've been I I'm going to teach preach about faith Hallelujah see we too late praise the Lord see you need to go unto maturity okay now see even the Bible is keep telling us he says here we know we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for for whom he did forn he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified okay so all things will will going to work together for good to us to them that love God all God will use everything amen okay praise God sometimes we look at is something bad things that happening in our life but God is trying to do something in your life so that you will grow amen see praise God because we are predestinated to conform in the image of his son praise God Amen see Hallelujah again it says here in one more scripture it says here 2 Corinthians 3:18 but we all with open face beholding us in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed amen into the same image from glory to glory praise God God is going to change that see even as by the spirit of the Lord see you will not change yourself okay don't change yourself I've been always in telling it to the people praise God see Hallelujah you know one time our church we are renting in uh in an old house in the Philippines see it's a you know uh the old house in the Philippines made of food and it's big okay then uh we are the second floor uh during the time our church still small we only have um 10 people you know praise God and for [Laughter] Minister praise God okay I'll just put it there see and you know uh there is a stair going up to the second floor and there is a what do you call not the landing you know but uh uh when you go up there they have enough room see for people to drink praise God while we are while we are upstair praising the Lord they are down they are downstair uh drinking wine you know they are drunkard see then one day one that that person go up you know see a drun card went up to the you know and he talked to me he said Pastor said I want to join your church I said yeah you are very much welcome see but my problem he says if I come here see when I go down my friend will again ask me to drink I said praise the Lord what's the problem see he said I know it is not uh allow in your church to drink see I said who tell you that then he looked at me he was surprised when I when I when I tell it when I asked that question he said is it allowed to your church I said okay what is better see you go down and keep on drinking and did not heard hear the message the gospel or you come up here you listen to the gospel and then you go down and drink what is better see so he was he was surprised you know he was curious he said is it it is allow in your church I said yeah see can I do that am I not adding sin to my sin I said no see this is what you need to do next week you come up here and listen to the gospel then after you leave after the service you go down and drink see then drink all the wine that you can drink see don't stop it just keep drinking until you get tired then when you get tired you come back to me again he said am I not add sin to my sin I said no see because sinner cannot sin right how can you make black black that's why the prophet said it cannot be black is already black see how you condemn it condemn no way see he needs the good news amen right see I told them don't change yourself okay just do what you want to do see when you get tired you come back to me then we will sit and we will talk again see you can't understand it definitely that s sinner cannot sin that's why I've been telling it to the people you know see the church is for the sinner right praise God hallelujah see praise God that's why I've been telling it also the people you know if you don't want to serve the Lord you better go out and rob a bankk see in that way if you can if you rub a bank then you can get a lot of money right see you can maybe you can buy a plane you can have a private plane and do all these things see praise God in that way when you die when the Lord ask you where you going you will just say I know Lord I know where I am going see praise God Amen see hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord see so we are you know God is changing us not US changing ourself don't change yourself amen okay he promis it he will going to change us from glory to glory by the spirit of the Lord see I never change myself okay praise God you know I'm not a drun card I drink uh occasion Al I'm not a gambler I went but I went into Casino see praise God I don't play with we with women I don't even know how to court you can ask my wife praise God and I'm a good boy okay praise God my only my my only weakness is I always curse you know every time I speak I will curse first see then in the middle of the speech I keep on cursing then I will finish cursing you so when the Lord called me into the ministry my goodness I said Lord if I got [Laughter] excited see but God take it out from my sister see that's why I know what I am saying it take it out of my system praise God I did not take it out I did not stop it he just took it out praise God hallelujah see he's going to change us from glory to glory amen okay praise the Lord then now Hallelujah see we know it Christian are being processed there is no such thing as instant Christian okay because a lot of uh you know when I first come into the Lord he said just raise your hand just accept the Lord then you're born again see praise God so we keep on raise our hand you know then the next Sunday the pastor will ask again who wants to accept the Lord definitely I want to accept the Lord I raise him again Hallelujah see Christian are being processed okay praise God there is no such thing as instant Christian yeah see we have instant coffee instant noodle praise God hallelujah but there is no such thing as instant Christian Christian is being processed okay we are being processed that's why that's why the the message told us there there there are three step of Grace right justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost okay praise God and then now Hallelujah see we have this type in Shadow okay the Old Testament is a shadow so praise God see sometimes we need the shadow okay in that way in that way it will check we need to have a check and balance remember that praise God everything that's happening in our age you can see that in the New Testament you can also see that in Old Testament praise God see hallelujah amen because the Bible said for the law having a shadow of good things to come see and not the very image of the things can now see it is not the very image of the things but it is praise God a sh shadow of something good will coming out praise God hallelujah God show us you know praise God that's why Jesus Keep on uh uh explaining to them you know sometimes he he explain it in Parable sometimes uh uh he explain it through Shadow praise God because he said if I will tell you directly you will not understand me see that's why God gave us this shadow in that way we can understand praise God hallelujah see now it says here you know so we are going to study about how the Christian grow okay praise God see now when God asked Moses in Exodus 25:8 to9 Hallelujah see he says here and let them make me a sanctuary that I May dwell among them see the purpose of this Sanctuary is so so that God can dwell with his people okay but he said according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all instrument thereof even so shall ye make it see so God commanded Moses and this is the Tabernacle okay praise God that uh Moses built in the wilderness praise God see God said you will do it according praise God see to the pattern that I show you in heaven okay so now praise God there is no one idea came from Moses Hallelujah right that's no one idea praise God you know Moses say Lord why should we use gold it's dangerous why not just wood see in that way people will you know will not rob it people will will will not have an will not have interest you know praise God see and then even the laborer even the worker it is God would choose it that's right right praise God see Moses can re recomend his siblings you know Lord you know my nephew my uncle but no even the laborer even the worker it is God who choose it see and even the color right it is God who choose it not Moses see praise God Moses maybe can say it Lord the green color is much better than the red see but no Hallelujah everything came from God okay praise God if you can see this Tabernacle of God hallelujah see praise God you see you see him that's you and that's me praise God we are outside of the Tabernacle of God okay praise praise God hallelujah and what is that place the scripture the scripture say uh the message said you know the church is the outer Court okay see now then a Believer coming now that's out of Fellowship away from God away from the main Fellowship what does he do he comes to the outer courts first and to this clean place where the water of Separation was waiting for him a type of the church today see praise God this is the outer Court where the water of separation will be served amen praise God see and the water of Separation today is the word see praise God now Paul in Ephesians 5:26 said that God had purchased the church by the washing of the Water by the word and the word is Christ in the beginning was the word the Word was God and the Word was God and is God yet and the Waters of Separation that separates you from your iniquity and so forth is the preaching of the word in the courts you see it praise God so this is the courts this is where the water of separation is right this is where the word of God being preached to the people to separate you from iniquity amen praise God Amen Hallelujah when you said iniquity you know know it is right and you're not doing it you know it's wrong and you keep on doing it praise God that's why we we come to the church need to be reminded okay that's how important the church is praise God hallelujah here's a good thing for the pastor now I'm looking this way I'll better look this away the Waters of Separation was to be kept in a clean Place The Church Must Be a clean Place see praise God you need to have a home Church okay and that home Church must be clean not the habitation of every foul bird all kinds of things going on fastings that right a clean place the water was to be kept praise God see Hallelujah sometimes people you know they said oh I will just stay home then there is a direct quotation you know see you cannot stay home amen and then you will say the prophet said then you will said I will stay home and live a a Christian Life he said you cannot do that see there is something about the church praise God see remember that Good Samaritan when that fellow he came from Jerusalem then went to Jericho in between praise God hallelujah see that Good Samaritan found him okay he was beaten praise God maybe by the levit by the religious group right see by the Publican those smart people there he was beaten and the Bible said now he's half dead then the prophets half dead is physically alive but spiritually dead yeah Hallelujah see then the Good Samaritan give him the first aid first right then he carry him where into a into an inn right and what is an inn that is the home Church it is God who carry you not you coming here okay God will give give you a home church amen praise God and then see the inkeeper was commissioned to take good care of the ship praise God and God gave him two pence and that's the only New Testament right and he said take good care take good care of this person see praise God that's why I've been telling it to sometimes to the ministers don't worry about the ministry a lot of a lot of people are looking for a for the Min for a Ministry I've been telling it to them you look for the lost soul amen and ministry will follow amen praise God see when I went out I just want people I just want people to be saved I don't want to be any I don't want to be a minister I don't even call myself minister during that time people just called me Pastor my people just called me Pastor I did not tell them to call me pastor but they want to call me Pastor see like brother branam said just call me brother I just telling them call me brother but they don't want it see praise God hallelujah see it is not they say it is not that lifting you up but it is sign of our respect to you that's all see praise God everybody need to have a home church it's very important see you cannot stay home and become a Christian see there is no such thing as a home Christian Hallelujah see you need to have a home Church see Hallelujah say one time I Shar about the Battle the house of God see you know the batt that is where the the the Jacob laders you know it was hooked in heaven and then it was planted on Earth you cannot go in heaven without going to the battle praise God hallelujah see sometimes people just don't understand what church is Right praise God exactly see okay Jesus said Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gate of Heaven cannot Prevail see praise God and the Gate of Heaven meaning that is also a gate see the church that Jesus is going is going to build is a gate that's why it has a key praise God see who got the key see and people don't understand it praise God they don't know what church is they don't know what Pastor is they think Pastor is just somebody who will stand behind the pulpit and keep on giving the sermon praise God hallelujah see that's why pro the prophet said the pastor is the representative he represent God Amen to the people Allelujah see so how can you go into heaven without passing through the gate no way Hallelujah see that's why the church that gate need to be clean amen praise God and then the word is to keep in a clean place a clean heart a pure conscience that be given out to the hearer see so the one that will H the world it must have a clean heart praise God see that's why sometimes you know I feel I'm angry okay when I saw this kind of ministers committing adultery see stealing God's money I can't understand it see praise God and they claiming to be Pastor see they said if you cannot respect the person respect the office I said but he has no office praise God do you can you believe that a pastor committing adultery is a born again see he's not even born again how can he be a minister and then he's quoting David Solomon see praise God hallelujah that's why the message is very clear here see if you are doing it the prophet said you know when you are born again you cannot do this things this things and these things see now we reverse it if you do it it means that you are not born again that's right see praise God hallelujah see it must be handled by a clean hand with a good with a clean conscience with a clean heart with a pure heart okay that's why the pastor praise God hallelujah see the pastor heart is different it is full of compassion praise God hallelujah his heart is always with the people no pastor wants his people to go to hell no pastor wants it even how naughty or how this be or what praise God see I've been telling it to my church all I want everybody will be in the Rapture amen nobody will be left behind praise God see even to my children all I want to my children I told them I I don't care if you finish your schooling if you did not finish your SCH schooling I don't care if you become poor or Rich that's not a problem see praise God it's not sin to be poor right that's right Hallelujah see all I want for them is to go to heaven to be saved and go to heaven that's all I want praise God see and by the grace of God all my children they finish his schooling see that's why when they are studying I been I always telling them don't study hard just relax praise God see it's not a problem you know praise God if you are not smart right it's also a gift right it's a gift imagine if there are 50 50 student in one room and you are the the dumbest it's a gift imagine Hallelujah you're one in a 50 praise God hallelujah so don't worry I've been telling it to them see just study don't study hard okay praise God see but by the grace of God all my children they are very good in the school I don't pressure them I don't force them praise God when they go out and work I've been telling them also just work don't work hard see a lot of people they're trying they are working hard until they got sick to pay the doctor you know don't do it okay just work enjoy life right enjoy your life praise the Lord see now says here again one more quote okay still early right okay then it says here now the church is the outer Court then we will go into Fellowship see I'm just reading the quote first then we will go to the visual it that way praise God you will know that I am not uh uh teaching it in my own self see we are uh we are following the message because we are message people okay remember you're in the courts now but the next thing is to enter into the fellowship with the Believers on the common ground of fellowship and before they could enter through after the Waters of Separation after the Waters of Separation what is that preaching of the word had separated them from the sin then they had to go through the public testimony of seven Stripes of blood showing that death went before them to pay the way and every believer after hearing the word has to come to the recognition of the Lord Jesus Christ that going before them to bring them into the fellowship then inside coming through the sprinkled blood at the door remember it was seven stripes and seven Stripes spoke of The Seven Ages seven Church ages that also seven is God's perfect number no other way of redemption only through the blood through the seven years 6,000 years even to the Millennium nothing but the blood will be recognized any time a public testimony to the blood comes life and they had to enter through every age through the blood and after entering the blood they come into Fellowship see what a beautiful thing here praise God now Hallelujah see so now you're here there you are see and if you will notice there is this is the courtyard okay and and this is the holy place and we call it holy of holies okay praise God hallelujah see first you heard the gospel okay the word of God that will separate you from from your sin praise God see then you know this this gate it has the seven stripe praise God of the blood of the Lamb see it shows uh it shows that the in every Church ages seven Church ages we need the blood no exception same thing with us see praise God but then you are still here you need to go in here and in that area there is an altar see again there are three altar first the burnt offering the second is the altar of incense and the third is the Ark of the Covenant see and God was not on on this first altar not on the second altar also but on the third altar okay praise God hallelujah then there are three kinds of light here we have the natural light meaning the sunlight the moonl praise God see when you are here praise God see you need to go in if you will not go in oh oh I receive the Lord I receive the Lord praise God you're holding the lamb the lamb of God but you are only here oh the lamb is so beautiful oh the word of God is so nice praise God you need to move on okay when you move on there is an altar see the altar of burn burnt offering see and there there is the Brazen labor that's why all Christian praise God you need to cross and go in here when you go in here praise God the first altar that you will meet is the altar of burnt offering see but you need to have a lamb see you cannot go there and stroll or you will die see this is not a CG Park Hallelujah see and then praise God you will give the lamb to the priest and he will not burn the whole lamb he will cut the feet of the lamb and he will take the inwards see praise God hallelujah so when the Christian go into this place bringing the lamb praise God you need to be [Music] baptized see praise God you need to be wash see praise God see when when you then they will cut the feet of the animal meaning to say you know before your feet right when you are still here where did your feet taking you every Sunday right before your feet take you to the movie house take you to a drinking spree dancing praise God but now your feet take you to the church see it will be cut praise God then your inwards see will be burned it will take the inward and it they will burn it praise God that's why that's why the scripture said I will give you a new spirit in a new heart amen praise God see that's the only thing that they will going to burn okay praise God hallelujah now it has a natural life when a Christian is in this place you are controlled by the Natural Things praise God when the light shine shine bright you can H you can jump high praise the Lord hallelujah see but when there's clouds In Heaven There is storm in your life Hallelujah see when you are still here praise God you are like like like you are like a salt you know you know the salt s a l t praise God once the rain pour the salt will be dissolved then when the sunshine when there is strong Sunshine then the salt will appear see Hallelujah when you're still here you you are controlled by your by the natural thing see oh I have no money oh I have no food oh I have no this and this and this all this natural will affect you amen praise God how can I go to the church I have no money to pay for the go lead praise God maybe you can walk right praise God see but when you are here you're being controlled by the natural light praise God hallelujah amen see and here there is there is a food that you're you're going to eat the Heavenly Mana see and the Bible said the Heavenly Mana tastes good it's sweet see so when a Christian see is here like when you are still here like when we go out and evangelize the people we said oh God loves God's love God's God loves you see praise God God will heal you God will bless you oh people said oh I want to accept the Lord see so when a Christian is still here that's all he can eat he only want to listen and he only want to listen those good things God will bless you brother God will bless you Sister see but then when there's storm in your life sister why why did not you are not in the church what happened Hallelujah you so many excuses right where were you you are just here see praise God hallelujah see you only want to hear that kind of message see then now inside we have this what we call them seven seven golden Candlestick see we have this seven golden Candlestick then we have this another another altar see praise God this is where uh the altar of incense and then we have this uh uh uh un living bread okay you know this is man-made light okay so when you go into this place praise God okay when the priest go into that place he will change his Rob see praise God and then that robe you cannot sweat once you sweat you die see praise God hallelujah that's a spal robe see when the Christian go into this area we call it the holy place that is where you stop drinking see stop gambling stop smoking see that's why we call it holy Place praise God Hallelujah see a lot of people can come into the first right here in the outside Court praise God hallelujah but in this area praise God when you go into here all your all all your vies will stop amen that's the people that's why the people think oh I'm now born again right see God is with me now not yet amen see there is no God here God is in this area praise God hallelujah so when you go in here praise God you have also something to eat the unliving bread see so when the Christian go into this place now he will start eat the unle bread what is the UNL bread the word of God see where did the where is the B where where in the Bible that said that the woman cannot cut their hair see then you will ask the manmade light see praise God that's why Jesus said you enjoy the light of John right but I am the True Light see ministers are light praise God hallelujah that's why I've been telling you to the people you know you don't need to encourage the congregation you just need to encourage the pastor and the church will be encouraged you don't need to revive the church you revive the pastor praise God see imagine if your pastor every time he will come here and he he got a long face oh my my oh my my what a life what a life what will happen to the congregation see everybody is a long face also see when you go out of the church all are sad see praise God that's why anywhere I go in the mission field I want to make sure the pastor will be encouraged because he will the he is the one that will encourage his people not the people to encourage the pastor see sometimes the pastor is asking the people to encourage him no you are the leader praise God see you must show them that you're strong you cannot even show them you know praise God that you're crying you need to show them that I'm strong even inside you're crying Hallelujah see praise God he is the man-made light that's why if there is some problem you will go to your pastor when you are inside the SE there is the altar of incense it represent the prayer when you go into that area now you become prayerful before you go out you will pray praise God see before you eat you pray before you go anywhere you want to ask the Lord then you will go to your light to the manmade light Pastor I'm going to this area Pastor I I I'm going to do this Hallelujah see that's why when the oil in that lamb see praise God become few what will happen then the light will become small see that's why when the pastor he is the light of this church praise God if the oil become few then his light will become small then the church praise God will become dark Hallelujah see praise God that's why now see when a Christian go into that area you're not going to eat you not you now want to read the the scripture you know now you want to see where where the scriptures said it but when you are in the outer Court you just want to listen Faith come to Faith cometh by hearing Faith cometh by hearing see praise God hallelujah that's why there is time in our life see we want to read the we want to read the Bible when you come into this place you will become legalist see I know it see when the pastor read the scripture oh I know what is going to preach Hallelujah who are you you are now in this area right praise God hallelujah see that's why I've been telling you to the people to become legalist is normal see praise God but you need to know your position okay don't don't disrespect your pastor praise God you don't know what what you are doing if you are disrespect your pastor praise God see that's why the prophet is very very clear respect respect the pastor see the Bible is also very clear praise God see Hallelujah listen to your pastor he will be accountable to your soul see praise God okay he will be accountable not you to your soul do you understand that English praise God the pastor is accountable that's why it's very praise God important you find the right home church right Pastor am praise God he will be responsible to you yes sir praise God you know when the prophet go beyond the curtain of time right then he said oh I want to see Jesus then those people behind him praise God he asked the the angel asked do you know them I said no I don't know them they are your people oh they are or Brams no they are your converts see and he said I want to see Jesus then those people said not yet time and time will come you will go and face him see you will face him and then he will prove you yes sir praise God Amen if he found that you preach the right message of you or if you tell the truth to the people or if you preach the gospel then he said you will come back for us you will bring us where you are going Hallelujah they did not said after God prove you then we will go next no that's a message praise God hallelujah see that's how important a pastor is praise God hallelujah see so you need to be praise God you need to do it see respect them they are accountable to your soul praise God see if you if you think in in our church okay not in this church I've been telling it to my people if you think that I am not your pastor you better go out see if you think you know more than me me I am not your pastor you better go out I just want you to be in the Rapture that's all in my heart right see if my Ministry cannot make you grow then go out and find a church and find your pastor am but if you think that I am your pastor then respect me praise God I am God representative to you see Hallelujah so it's very important okay Hallelujah then see next thing we have what we call the supernatural light so you need to move on you know like I say when you are here it is like uh the testimony of the sea you know praise God first they said about oh Jesus healed this Jesus healed this oh you know you see this miracle you see this miracle then praise God suddenly they have nothing to testify fight now become quiet see that's why sometime in the life of a Christian it seems like we know everything right like I told you when a pastor open the Scripture it seems like you know it already praise God see I just been telling it to the people don't do it just move on move on see when you are in this area it seems like God is not answering your prayer anymore see when you are in the outer Court everything is very fantastic oh God loves me oh God bless me oh God heal me but when you go into this area sometimes you are you know you are like those Apostle in the testimony of the sea it seems like God is not answering your prayer anymore no he's now watching you you see what are you going to do praise God see just move on don't stop just move on so when you are here praise God that's why you have a pastor okay pastor I feel this way I feel that way see and a good pastor will always encourage you will always point you to to Christ remember that praise God hallelujah see see that's why you have this altar of incense once you go into this place you become prayerful you always want to pray you always want to pray right oh before we start we are going to pray you go to praise God amen hallelujah amen see praise God but you are only here you need to move on when you move on there now we have that CH kind of Glory we call it the supernatural light okay praise God here we are we have the Heavenly Mana we have the Sho bread and then praise the Lord okay there it is see here we have the hidden Mana see in this area there is only one Furniture see the Ark of the Covenant amen see but inside that furniture There are three things yes okay here you can see all the furniture the altar of a burnt offering the BR and labor excuse me that's why when that's why when uh you're here then you will go in see a lot of people can go into this place okay see that's why in this area Israel only the chosen people of God can go in praise God and Israel is the whole country okay that's why a lot of people can come into this outer Court in the courtyard I mean praise God see but God is not there right right here you can you can listen to the word of God see that's why I've been telling it to the people you know if you have a friend if they have a have so many problem then you approach him you share to him the word of God he feel Enlighten he said I like it I like where is your church now they want to go to the church see praise God why because they are eating the Heavenly Mana you're sharing them the Heavenly Mana praise God hallelujah but they are only here the the we have Heavenly Mana here we are also have Heavenly Mana here the same the same food that you're going to eat so when you go into this place praise God hallelujah all you want to do is to listen praise God you don't want to read the Bible but when you go in here now you you're now interested in the reading of the Bible praise God hallelujah who's now reading the Bible see Hallelujah but then when you go in here now we have the hidden Mana amen praise God hallelujah see that's why we message people we are not satisfied with the Heavenly Mana we are not satisfied with the UNL Mana we are satisfied we you know the only thing that can satisfi us is the hidden Mana praise God hallelujah yeah see that's why when I when I go out into the denominational people when we have this uh pra seminar I've been telling it to them see even the Bible is telling you to grow praise God see you know in the hidden Mana that is the original right then I will ask them this question okay if Adam blood types is eight and Eve came from Adam so his blood must be type A also right see then how come in the whole world there are only two major types of blood see sometimes you just need to wet their appetite praise God see how come see America suppos USA suppos their blood should supposed to be Type U right Filipino type f Japan type J see in Africa there are so many country Ghana type G Nigerian Type n but how come that the African people can give their blood to the American white people see meaning to say that we come from Adam and Eve see but the question where is that second type of blood come from when there are only two people Adam and Eve where is that type B come from Hallelujah see then they will ask the question see that is the hidden Mana Hallelujah see that's why I've been telling it to the people it's different now sharing the gospel now it's not in this area not not Heavenly Mana not sh bread okay praise God it's about the hidden Mana now see when you go out you oh God loves you everybody knows it right when you go out then then you will say oh God will bless you Hallelujah they said oh even our God can bless us Buddha can bless us Allah can bless us Allelujah what the difference that's why the prophet said what is now the difference between you and them see they have the same God that can bless them you have the same God you know Hallelujah see that's why in our age is different the way we share the message is different now see when we go out when we share like brother Paul said we study the seven Church ages when I go out I've been asking them you know when you go into that denominational churches they will ask you what you're going to preach see they will not just let you preach see they will you know they will investigate praise God when they asked me what are you going to preach I said I'm going to preach about history Hallelujah see the seven Church the history of Christianity see then you will start sharing them the seven Church ages see praise God that is the hidden Mana praise God that's why the the message believer you know like I've been always saying that that's why the prophet said you cannot you cannot uh uh preach uh to the message people people this wishy-washy you know praise God see Mage minister they they they study right praise God before they come to the church they pray then they study they Hallelujah see because a message people they are very demanding that's a problem Hallelujah see amen praise God hallelujah but but like I'm saying you know there's a lot of thing that we we we can share we can tell we can preach in the message amen praise God this is this is just very basic okay I'm just telling you praise that you need we need to grow okay this is good for the young people in that way you will understand where you where you are where you're standing see because sometimes they thought that oh I'm born again no not yet maybe you are here maybe you're here see praise God hallelujah born again will happen in this area amen praise God see that's why you know the the the rod of Aon what's inside that uh Ark of the Covenant the rod of Aeron that is a dead Rod but it's it bed amen then it bring fruits amen praise God hallelujah see hallelujah look here a lot of people can come in but in this area only the lits see the liit they are anointed they are uh they are Sanctified okay praise God that's why when you got Sanctified you are now in this area like the Levites but then like I told you they will change their clothes their robe special robe they are going to wear a robe that cannot you know if you sweat you die praise God see that's why some sisters some brothers said oh the sister will say oh I cannot oh praise God I want still wants to cut their hair he still want to put makeup and the brother also now praise God hallelujah before you know you you don't tell to to to to to the brother not to wear an earring but today you need to you need to tell it to them also don't we earring Brothers see before you're just telling it to the W to the sister Hallelujah see praise God then sometimes the sister oh I cannot do it I cannot do it Hallelujah see you don't you don't need to do it like I told you like like when God took that out of me about the cursing see Allelujah he took it out I did not I did not stop it amen okay he took it out praise God see no sweat okay praise God if you're still sweating to live a holy life you die amen praise God see Hallelujah but then you will know it praise God once you go inside that Holy of holy place see your life will just be Sanctified that's why I've been telling you know when I was uh in one country the Pastor said you know brother N I listen to you see I've been telling it to the people I've been telling it to the sister don't cut their hair see don't put makeup but they are sin doing it I told to the brother you know the only thing you need to do is just to share them the message amen see amen was see that's why when I go out on the mission field I know if the pastor is preaching the message or not amen see because if you if they teach the message to the people the message will going to produce the S justification will produce the sanctification say will produce the baptism of the Holy Ghost see you don't need to go out and preach about justification or sanctification just preach the message and it will bear fruit of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost unto adoption see praise God hallelujah see so once you go into that holy of holies now you are in the presence of God see you know like the prophet said that wall that curtain is so thick that you can hear anything outside of that uh room amen see you are in the presence of God and you know when you are in this area you're doing a lot of things see you bring the animal you kill the animal and you do this and you do that then when you when you go into this holy Place praise God you're still doing something you will light the you will clean the you know the Seven Candle Stick the the the the shoe bread and this but a little bit lighter right but when you go to the holy of holies you are not going to do anything you will just sit there in the presence of God and then you will eat a handful of hidden Manana you'll just eat there eat and eat Hallelujah see see that's why the prophet said you know Christianity is based upon rest see praise God when you go inside that uh in that holy of holies you're not going to do anything anymore see Hallelujah that's why Paul said it is not me it is him right greater is he that's in me than he that is in the world praise God hallelujah see praise the Lord hallelujah so the this is what the prophet said okay we're almost done says here on the outside there what light did they have they had the light of the stars at night okay see okay here we have the Levites here we have one nation then in the Holy place there is only one tribes but then in the holy of holies there is only one person amen see it's getting fewer and fewer and fewer see praise God that's why what can we do that is the that is the shadow okay praise God see that's why they are saying oh you're just few amen because according to the shadow only one person can go into the holy of holies right praise God but thank be to God if God will add more soul to this church okay we are not against it also but even though God will F this with people still we are still in minority see even if you get all the number of in the whole world the message people my goodness we are still just a small number compared to those religious group okay praise God hallelujah see one nation one tribes one person praise God hallelujah see now this is what the prophet said on the outside what light did they have they had the light of the stars and night the light of the Moon they had the light of the sun any kind of the cloud could come over and upset the whole thing they could not see how to walk the night sometimes Cloud shut out of the moon and stars at daytime the sun won't shine for days and weeks that's the way the experience is out y That's right let little trouble comes up and you backslide where were you you were just out the outside that's right see a little trouble you backslide a little trouble you will not come to the church anymore oh I will just stay home see right live streaming Hallelujah see there is something about the church amen you know when the pandemic hit us the moment the moment our government close everything we are already on live streaming we never stop see and I told you brother I enjoy it amen yeah you don't need to be here to to uh to how to Hur you know because you're already there at home that's right see my children will set set up all this uh video C and everything praise God hallelujah then you will you will just stand in front of that camera and finish and after we done it's so nice see then when the government open up I said Lord you know we are we we rent we are renting a place see that's why I tell it to my people I tell it I'm asking the Lord so if we can if it can be done like that what we are trying what we are going to do I said Lord we're just going to have this uh online service and then once a month we're going to rent a place then everybody can come in that way we can save a lot of money see in that way the church will not be burdened see but the Bible is very clear don't forsake the assembly see because the it is where God will are are training us it is where God will will mold our character see Hallelujah that stat of a perfect man right praise God when you read that when you study that a per statute of a perfect man he says patience patient what patient for your brother see praise God hallelujah right temper to control your tongue see to work to your brother and sister that even you're so angry you will go you will just say praise the Lord praise the Lord sister I'm so angry with you but Hallelujah amen you are my sister godliness see where are you going to

trouble comes up and you backside and you go up here Y and you go from one Church to another and pack your paper from one place to another and I won't go to the Baptist no more because I tell you I just don't like it over there see praise God and that's the problem if you don't know what church is that's okay Hallelujah better make up your mind amen see if this is your home church this is the gate see Hallelujah the pastor you know God said to Peter Peter do you love me Peter said yes Lord pet my lamb next Peter you love me yes Lord feed my sheep again he said Peter do you love me Peter was so upset he said Lord you know my heart but Jesus said feed my sheep see who's feeding the ship who's holding the key okay Hallelujah see praise God Amen you go of Yonder from one Church to another you don't have the revelation of what the church is right okay true I hope you can read between the line see then he says here now no I've come farther than that brother branam I've tasted of the Lord I know he's good that's good all right you're here at the first altar then you are at the holy place now you went into the holy place but remember they had life too but it was artificial light they had a seveno light to give light them light sometimes go low sometimes they smoke up you know what a light is sometimes it went out see praise God hallelujah see so when the pastor i' been telling it to you you know that's why you need to encourage it is you need to encourage the pastor Pastor don't worry it is that the pastor oh CH don't you worry no Hallelujah both ways okay amen praise God hallelujah you need to encourage one another praise God next it says here okay but look on the inside of brother man that once went in there what did what did he come in there see every Earthly light every artificial light was shut off from him and the only light he was was under the wings of the cherubims was the shik light a real s Holy Light that never went out so when you go into that area from in the holy of holies and now everything will be fine see there is no clouds you don't need the oil see there is the glory of God am the ever presence of God hallelujah see and then he

talk about I I don't really want to even though I do want to preach it's only quarter after 8 my I don't want to keep us tonight we have service tomorrow but you know brothers and sisters I think it's just a beautiful beautiful description we heard tonight about the Tabernacle and there's no shortcuts as a Christian we all have to come in from the outside Wilderness into the outer Court we have to identify with that sacrifice we've got to feel the life leave our sacrifice identify with that life that was in that animal with our lamb but then we've got to go into that Holy place and and our brother said it he touched on it I'm probably going to preach on this as we go forwards but many people get stuck in there they believe God's done so much for them and he has but we can't stay there it's man-made it's God ordained but it's still man-made we've got to go all the way into Christ we've got to get away from all the artificial and the one that really hit me tonight was so good it goes Al along with what I was talking about how many people get so offended in the message in churches oh my I'm offended you know when you get in behind that inner Veil you can't hear anymore the things on the outside you can't hear the chatter anymore it's gone because you're not listening to that you're there fellowshipping with that shakina a glory and you know brothers and sisters I say help me I'm human being too we all are on a journey and it's all a process just like the Rapture is a process isn't that beautiful it's not just an event we have got to mature just keep marching brothers and sisters I just I'm so happy about the service tonight all the songs they just were exactly in align with what we heard just beautiful do you love them tonight amen maybe we could just sing that song there's a fountain before we sing that song we'll just close in prayer let's just bow Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we thank you for the word that we've heard Lord Jesus help us to take it to heart Lord to not shovel it over our shoulder and think that everything is good with me in my life it's got to be for someone else oh Father it's for us every single one of us can take and eat of the table tonight that you've prepared for us father help us to just take the word Lord Jesus take it to our hearts and digest it father because we know it's setting the stage for what you have in store

the message tonight we thank you for sending us a prophet who didn't Point himself point to himself he pointed everyone to you Lord and tonight we preach that same gospel we know that that Prophet went behind the beyond the curtain of time and and and he said will Paul have to be judged for what he preached and we know Lord Jesus that prophet he preached what Paul preached and we're so thank thankful that we have that Anchor Point in our lives because we preach the same thing oh Lord there's nothing new Under the Sun and we certainly thank you for your goodness we thank you for the Revelation that you've given us because we know the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against the revelation of who we are when we have you in our lives help us Lord Jesus to go all the way into the holy
