Earth in this universe that you're not aware of and father we're so thankful that you have something special for us tonight Lord you have that word that we need Lord father we heard last night that we have your unchanging hand that you have reached down to man and you have granted that that firm grip of support Lord Jesus and to know that it's not some some hand floating through the air and it's not necessarily even another human being but it's the word that you have given us for our day Lord Jesus and that word has taken a hold of Our Lives Lord and taken us up father Lord there's so many

around tonight and amen we see that there's more than two or three here but amen there's a a church full of Believers that believe Jesus Christ amen is the same yesterday today and forever and they believe he's here in the power of his resurrection amen I believe he's here tonight to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or thank amen and we do want to say God bless you all this evening we do count it a real honor and the privilege to be here with you once again and we just pray something was said last night to be a blessing to you and to be an encouragement in your walk with

amen in the book of 1 John chapter 4 and maybe before we read the word we just buy our hearts together tonight and let's just invite the spirit of the Holy Ghost in This building to do something special for us Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here this afternoon and Lord we are very well aware that we're not here just to fulfill a religious Duty and Lord to take up time in the evening but Lord we're here father to hear from you to receive from your word Lord to fill the angels of God as they would brush across the congregation father bearing witness in our spirits that we are the children of God lord as we're here tonight to move into promises Lord I pray Lord that the spirit of the enemy would be bound tonight father I pray you would bring a strength into our lives

thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen amen and amen God bless you tonight the book of First John the 4th chapter I want to begin reading here in the first verse the Bible says beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they have whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world Amen now hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God now this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world but ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them so those that are of the world speak according to the world and the world hears them because they actually belong to the world but we are of God and he that knoweth God heareth us and he that is not of God heareth not us now hereby know we now I want you to notice here we're not guessing but hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats here tonight I I want you by the help of the Lord for just a few moment moments if I could amen if I would take a title tonight I want to speak to you on Conquering the Antichrist Spirit by spiritual discernment Conquering the Antichrist Spirit by spiritual discernment now we read there in 1 John chapter 4 and verse one where John says he says now beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirit whether they of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world now when you look here at this word try it actually means to prove or to discern it means to test to examine it means to scrutinize to see whether a thing is genuine or not now when you actually speak of this word trying you can actually take it to actually precious metals and that actually means to recognize amen as genuine after examination it means to prove or to deem worthy so when you actually try something amen or you discern it or you Pro prove it what you're doing is you're actually seeing if it's actually real amen or if it's false now brother brand preaches very uh two very powerful amen uh wonderful sermons on the subject of discernment Amen in 1959 he preaches a sermon called Discerning the body of the Lord how many has ever heard that sermon amen Discerning the body of the Lord then he comes and follows that up in 1960 and preaches the sermon called discernment of spirit so he actually says we are to discern amen the body of the Lord but then we are to discern the spirit amen that is motivating those who are actually members or are claiming to be amen members of the body of the Lord now amen he actually makes some very powerful statements in those sermons and I just want to read a few of them to you Amen in 1959 Discerning the body of the Lord he says now our Eternal destination amen is not altogether determined by what we see amen and what we hear but it is determined on what discernment we have amen of what we see and of what we hear again he says there we need discernment see amen we need the Discerning by the word amen the word is right how many can agree tonight that the word amen is right the word is right see amen so take the word amen because God's word is always right regardless of what you're looking at or regardless of what you're hearing amen what the word says about what you're seeing and what the word says about what you're hearing is right regardless amen of what the world thinks about it what religion thinks about it amen the word of God is the absolute and did his right in Discerning the body of the Lord again he says now we cannot discern by what people think amen what intellectual tells us or what psychiatrists tell us amen we got to go amen by What God Says see man shall not live by bread alone but by every word amen that proceedeth out of the mouth of God he said now not deserve turning the Lord's body and many are weakly and sick amen and many are asleep amen see they are dead spiritually dead amen because the last plague that hits the Earth amen is spiritual death y'all remember amen the last plague that hit Egypt was death right amen then the last plague that will hit the church is spiritual death he said what we need today is a spiritual awakening amen A Spiritual Awakening to discernment amen now watch this a prophet is not say Amen believe every spirit and follow every Spirit but rather he's saying try the spirits and prove whether they are of God or whether they are of the devil another place she says we have an order from God how many believes that we have an order from God Amen and it is for the Discerning amen of the spirit amen the trying of the spirit he said I believe that is a very great lesson for the church today amen is to try the spirit of anything amen so don't believe the spirit of everything amen but try the spirit of everything amen see have discernment of the spirit now when you look here at that word discernment amen it is the ability to judge well Amen in Christian context it is perception Amen in the absence of judgment with a view Amen to obtaining spiritual guidance and understanding now in 1 John chapter 4 I find it very amazing that John says amen beloved believe not every spirit amen but he says try the spirits now amen John actually uses the word spirit amen as plural which means there's going to be more than one amen but let's just go ahead and say what a prophet said he said but there's really only two Spirits amen so there's more than one amen but there's not more than two amen now you say preacher how can you say that amen because the prophet said one of them is God's holy spirit amen and the other one is the devil spirit amen that is working in deception amen and the people of the Earth are now amen making their choice see the holy spirit is here and he's calling out a bride for Christ how is he doing it amen by vindicating his Word of Promise to her amen for this age amen showing that it is Christ if it is a finger supposed to move the finger will move if the foot is supposed to move amen the foot will move if the eye is to see amen the eye will see amen the spirit of God as it is grown into the full stature of God Amen is the age that we are now living in he said see the holy spirit is here and he is vindicating the message of the hour the holy spirit is doing this so that the people amen that believe God will be called out amen of this chaos now how many can agree that the world is full of chaos amen Leia is full of Chaos chaos amen America and Canada and every nation amen is full of chaos amen but there is a spirit of of God that has come among the church amen to call us out of the chaos amen that we may walk in the light of the word amen and not stumble in the darkness of leosia listen it's the devil's Unholy spirit and he is here amen how is he calling his church amen he's calling his church by error amen is it okay to preach tonight is that okay amen he's calling his church by error so God is calling a church amen by vindicating the word amen and the devil is calling the church amen by taking the word and tur it into error as usual by perversion of the word of God Amen like he did at the beginning he said now see it coming right back Amen to that seed time again amen from Eden here it is again so we've actually gone all the way from Eden amen Back to Eden which in the first Eden was the was the seeds Amen in infancy but in this time amen what was in infancy has now come into maturity amen and the two trees that was in the garden amen symbol one symbolizing God the other one symbolizing the devil he said now see everything in the Earth today amen is traced back Amen to those two trees amen every spirit in the Earth today amen is traced all the way back to those two trees which was one the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and the other was the tree of life now brother says this in the church age book he said now the second thought that must be impressed on our hearts is that the seven Church ages amen started out with the Antichrist Spirit as well as the Holy Spirit who is to be blessed forever amen the the seven Church ages began amen by the Antichrist Spirit but it also began with a holy Spirit now John says there in first John he says there are many false prophets that are gone out into the world how many knows in Matthew 24 and 24 it said there shall arise amen there shall arise many false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much amen that if it were possible amen they shall deceive the very elect amen so there you see the devil Spirit of error amen working in deception that if it was possible it would deceive the very elect brother B comes along in the church AG book and says thus at this very moment we are in the complete fulfillment of Matthew 24:24 right we're not coming into it we're already in it and who it is that shall attempt to deceive the very elect amen why the spirit of antichrist Amen in the false anointed ones of this last day he said these false ones have already come in jesus' name claiming they have been anointed of God for the last day amen they are false Messiahs amen anointed ones they claim they are prophets amen but are they one with the word never they have added to or taken from it amen no one denies that the spirit of God Amen manifesting in gifts is upon them but like balam they all have their programs they make their appeal for money they exercise their gifts amen but they deny the word or bypass it for fear amen that a controversy might be their chances amen for greater gain yet they preach salvation and deliverance through the power of God Amen just like Judas amen with a Ministry imparted by Christ but because they are our wrong seed amen then consequently they have a wrong spirit amen motivating them so to every seed amen there is a spirit behind that seed he said see religious oh my they outshine the elect in effort and Zeal but it is lay out of sin it is not of Christ see for it looks for big crowds big programs amen startling signs amongst them listen they preach the second coming of Christ amen but they deny amen the Advent of the Prophet messenger though power and signs and true Revelation amen he Eclipse them all yes this false spirit in the last day is so close to the real that it can be distinguished only by its deviation from the word and wherever it called in being anti- it falls back on the one argument amen we have already shown to be false but we get results don't we amen so we have to be of God let me say results amen is not the sign amen of vindication of the spirit of God re said like this he said well they say well our churches of the Lord he said we're growing by Leaps and Bounds brother said I read in the newspaper this morning amen that prostitution is at the highest percentage it's ever been in the nation he said see so growth is not the sign amen God is with a move amen but the word being fulfilled in the power of the authority of the Holy Ghost amen is a direct evidence that God Amen is with the church now amen I believe that Jesus said in this last in time he said the two Spirits would be real close together again right amen the two Spirits would be real close together again now like it was two trees amen they stood side by side in the Garden of Eden is that right amen now notice it will be closer amen than that was so in the last days you all imagine Eve amen as she's walking through the garden amen and there's the tree of life there's the tree of knowledge and God has said do not partake of the tree of knowledge right amen so they're walking through the garden here these two trees amen are standing side by side now catch this brother B says in the last days he said the spirits will be closer than the trees were now think about that you are in the last days and he said oh children God have mercy upon us it would be so real to it would deceive amen the very elected if possible he said now how do we tell it in them days how are you going to tell it today amen the same way you stay with the word Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now I believe sometimes that we as Christians amen I believe that we forget what we should remember and I believe we remember what we should forget that's good now I believe all I believe we all need reminders from time to time in St John 14: 26 Jesus said amen that the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name amen he shall teach you all things and he will bring all things to your remembrance so the spirit of Truth amen will come among the church as the comforter and he will bring all things to your remembrance amen whatsoever I have said unto you in this discernment of spirit brother said who did it amen Christ said that the revelation of God the Holy Spirit would bring it to you a little while and I'll leave you but I'll pray the father and he'll send you the comforter and will bring these things to your remembrance now listen is that right amen that's what he's doing this morning and well what what will he do amen he will show you things to come see the holy spirit in the church amen in the last day so the holy spirit in the church in the last day amen is here to do more amen just make us shout or just make us dance amen or just make us feel good amen but the Holy Ghost has come into the church amen to reveal amen the word of God in the age that we're living in that's why God would send a prophet Amen to remind the church amen in 1 John 4 he said do not believe every spirit amen but try the spirits I love this quote you all know it by heart and the revelation of Jesus Christ he says now remember this amen I love how he says that now amen remember this he says Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts amen but the Book of Revelation shows amen how that the Antichrist spirit amen would come into the church and would defile it making it lukor formal and Powerless see it exposes Satan revealing his works and the attempted destruction amen of God's people and the discrediting of God's word amen right down to the time that he is cast into the Lake of Fire amen he fights that he cannot stand it because he knows that if the people get the true Revelation here it is amen if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works amen she will be an invincible Army if they get get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit amen discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit amen then Satan will be powerless before her listen he will be as definitely forwarded today as when Christ was stood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert amen yes Satan hates Revelation amen but we love it amen the devil hates re re ation amen but we love it because with true Revelation in our lives amen the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us amen but we will prevail over them I say thank God for the spirit of truth that anointed the seventh angel to remind the church amen that there is an anointing upon you and it's not an anointing to lay down to the Antichrist it's not an anointing to lay down to the confusion it's not an anointing to believe the spirit of er it is an anointing of the word of God Amen to discern that devil and conquer him yes sir where does our strength come from our strength comes from the true Revelation somebody shout the true Revelation our strength it comes from the true Revelation now brother picks this up with the God of this evil age he says now he speaking the God of this evil age amen he keeps you from seeing the true Revelation and the faith of God's word being revealed amen and Vindicated today how does he do it by his schools by his libraries by literature hospitals and so forth see he keeps you from it he is now interpreting as he did to pharo amen trying to keep you from seeing amen the meaning of the Vindicated word of this promised age in the evening light amen Vindicated and proved he is Tried by his knowledge and schools and better educated people in ethics and so forth Amen to keep you from seeing that amen anything so that you won't look at that and see that's Jesus Christ amen the devil wants you to look at anything amen except the word of God Amen so you will not see amen that it's not a man amen it's not a cult amen it's not a fall of people amen it's Jesus Christ and he'll tack any dirty name on it he can see he'll call it holy rollers and everything else am many Even Called Jesus be they call the master of the house beug then how much more are they going to call his disciples says it very beautiful he said behind everything there is a spirit there is a motive and an objective amen behind everything there is a spirit there is a motive and there is an objective amen he said this church comes here Amen to greatly exalt some human system or something then its motive is not right amen but if it's put here Amen to try to achieve something for the kingdom of God Amen then the motive and objective is Right amen if the motive is directed that way let me say the last days amen is a battle for the bride amen the last day battle for the bride amen will not be a natural Warfare amen it will be a spiritual warfare he said I do not think the war will be a missile Warfare amen but I think it'll be a spiritual warfare that'll come in and just take the nation over amen and put them to sleep amen till they get in and get a hold he said well if they get a hold there and take the United States amen then Canada is a small thing listen therefore there's nothing really in the world that we can build our hopes upon see amen upon any achievement we could give in this world because there isn't no hopes for it there is only one hope amen and that is Jesus Christ amen there's no hope in politics amen there's no hope in education amen help me preach a little bit if it's okay amen there's no hope in America there's no hope in a presidential change amen there's no hope in a leadership change for Canada amen the only hope of the church is the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ Listen America's headed down nations are headed down Israel's in a war nations are breaking Israel's Awakening hey but there is a message of the hour that has come among the church in the last days Amen to bring a reality of Jesus Christ you say who is it am then will be in this spiritual warfare it'll be the bride you say when will this spiritual warfare take place well according to 2 Timothy 3:1 he said this know also this know also that in the last days amen perilous time shall come look at this brother said now this no also in the last days he said now you underline that amen last days he said that's when it's going to happen when's it going to happen Amen in the last days when perilous time shall come listen what the prophet says he says we are in it amen listen we're not looking for perilous times we are in perilous times we are not looking for the last days we are in the last days I say we are living in the L of sin age amen which according to the prophet of God and the word of God is the most decept age that's right it's the most deceptive age of all Seven Ages now you all remember the part of God talks about Martin he says how that Martin was there and he said this Angel come to him and he said when this Angel come he came with a gold crown and he had shoes golden shoes inl and he was all golden up and he said now here Martin he said I'm your lord he said Fall Down and Worship me remember said he said that to him about two or three times he said but then all of a sudden amen Martin remembered that Christ did not promise to come like that he said see Martin took it to the word he said see you got to stay on the word amen because the great battle is at hand you got to stay on the word because the great battle is at hand he said we played church for years amen but the hour has come now that when Janice and jambers will with send Moses as the Bible said they would amen it's going to be a spiritual battle amen a conflict they'll just be continue on Amen the denominational Church just move right on into denomination and go on the way it does but I mean the real True Believer amen is coming to the battlefield listen how many real true believers amen have I got here tonight amen then a real True Believer is not following denomination amen into denomination a real True Believer is not following end time signs amen into more confusion but a real True Believer has come to the Battlegrounds of the spiritual warfare the final showdown amen between Christ and the Antichrist and they're standing on the word of God and they're defeating the devil amen not by the way they feel not by the way things are going not by the things way things are looking they are defeating the devil amen by spiritual discernment of the word of God to say this is God and this is God and this is God and that's the devil and we refuse to follow any trick or any device or any scheme of hell that's right come on the real True Believer is coming to the battlefield you'd better be first and know what you're doing or you could take on an evil spirit you could take on an evil spirit so easy and not know see if it's contrary to the word then don't you believe it now come on Church how hard is that hello how hard is that if it's contrary to the word right then don't believe it see you stay with that word now let me ask you this in the last days what it going to take to stand well the prophet of God said it's going to take a scriptural trained Church on the line for there's going to be carnal impersonations rise now I love this because the prophet breaks it down very beautiful and he says see many people they open their hearts to the wrong thing he said now you get a spirit all right but many times it contradicts the word and they'll say things like the days of Miracles is passed there's no such a thing as that amen remember are you hearing me remember that's a devil under the disguising of Christianity God help us when we get down to this after a bit that you'll see it's an evil spirit in the disguising of Christianity but it isn't the spirit of Christ because the spirit Spirit of Christ comes to the word every time he cannot deny his word listen Church what is his word amen his word is his voice and John said in 10:27 Jesus speaking my Sheep amen they hear my voice and I know them and they follow me listen the Sheep don't follow what the world says they don't follow what the church says they don't follow what a man says they don't follow what the Pope says or what a bishop says or what the Cardinal says hey if you are a sheep you will only follow what the word says amen because the word is your absolute see how will the people believe him amen unless they're constantly in the word he said now how he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word amen so that the bride will know her husband will know her mate the revealed word listen church if you are the bride you are not married to a preacher you are not married to a prophet you are not married to an influential man you are married to the word of God and you follow the word on your good days you follow the word and on your bad days you follow the word when you feel like it you follow it and when you don't feel like it amen because you're married to the word you have eyes for no other you have ears for no other you have a heart for no other yes sir we are pound to this word by the grace of God we are to be the children of light amen amen we are to be the children of light and the light is the word which is made light for this age how do we know light except it comes from the word amen the word made flesh the word made flesh is the light of the age when you see it now in the church age book remember the pro of God says that Revelation amen will show how the Antichrist Spirit would come in the church the framework of the Christian church and would defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless amen now watch what the prophet says he says we might as well face it the churches are cooling off well we just might as well face it the churches are cooling off he said see more preaching is being done than ever in the world and less practice than we ever did in all the world now listen I believe though that though we are in this world we are not of the world world I believe that Leota age amen is the age of the Turning time in the sil the Antichrist he says now to my opinion this is the age of the Turning time it's a time when men are either will come into the kingdom of God or they will be sealed out of the kingdom of God listen you're either going to be in Christ or you're going to be out of Christ and then there is no in between he said I believe that the Antichrist seals a person we're taught in the scripture Revelation 9 If any man receives his seal or his Mark or the letter of his name is doomed amen is sealed out of the kingdom of God and the spirit of Christ when Once sealed with that is sealed in the kingdom of God and just as sure as you can be sealed out with one you can be sealed in with another and tonight we're going to talk about now listen what the prophet says amen the sealing out and he says tomorrow about the ceiling in amen so there's two ceilings taking place there's a ceiling out amen but there's also a sealing in he said and you draw your own opinion as I try to keep it strictly on the word amen not opinions but the word now let's just go ahead and break it down real simple amen the Holy Ghost is the Seal of God that seals a man into Christ and seals the devil out Ephesians 4:30 said grieve not the spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of your Redemption listen this is not a temporary seal this is not a church seal this is an eternal seal when a man once receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost on his soul it'll sealing for Time and Eternity it'll seal the world out and it'll seal caught in listen I tell you what we need to do is we need to start preaching the Seal of God again and quit preaching psychology and quit preaching relaxing sermons and trying to hug well I might as well preach I'm here amen relax the atmosphere amen and get a little warm fuzzy feeling I say preach the fire of God Amen till the Holy Ghost comes to the church and burns out lukewarmness it burns out L come on we might as well preach or here amen some folks are getting little lay out of seeing amen and church is becoming optional the house of God is becoming optional amen going to church is only when we can make it amen I tell you what that is amen it's lay out of sea and it's creping the church even around the ranks of this message well we might as well preach and then we got parents putting their kids in sports and missing the house of God for ball games oh God come on somebody amen it's lay to seea amen we got Sports and televisions and everything else amen coming right back in our homes it's because somewhere somebody quit preaching that there's a seal in the church that can seal the devil out and can seal a Revival in I tell you what a seal does according to the Bible amen a seal will place someone Beyond doubt the direct definition of sealed amen is beyond doubt amen so ye are placed Beyond doubt until the day of your Redemption when you receive the Seal of God upon your life the Seal of God places you Bey on the doubt of the devil Bey on the confusion the listen I think it's time to move Beyond amen just going to church and paying our ties and singing a few songs and put some money in the offering amen and fellowship a little bit I think it's time to move into a place with God where we can walk unconscious of doubt we can walk unconscious of fear we can walk unconscious of unbelief come on Church we're not church members we are end time Believers and we're not at a picnic we're on a battlefield but there's a sword in our hand the captain of the host of the Lord is among the church I say arise and shine that light has come and the glory of the Lord has arisen upon you if been a time to fight amen now is a time to fight if there's ever been a season to believe hey now is a season to believe the word has returned to the church in Purity in thority and in reality Hallelujah I'm talking about a church who has gone beyond the Realms of Doubt they've gone beyond the Realms of feelings yes sir what are you you're not Hing buggy drivers right right you're not automobile drivers you're not even airplane pilots Come On You Are Spiritual astronauts brother said what is this m what is this ministry done amen this astronaut sees things the astronaut sees things oh God that the planes and everything is out of date so if you're still trying to ride in a horse and buggy amen you're out of date now we just actually a few days ago was over in in in Amish Country there in V vist

is amen bless your heart but you're stuck in a previous age amen there's been an advancment come there's been a breakthrough come there's been a release of power and we've Advanced beyond the air beond the horse and buggy into the automobile but listen let's go to the spiritual amen you can't stand the automobile because there was more than sanctification there was a baptism of the holy ghost underneath an airplane anointing and it got Pentecost up off the ground but let's just go ahead and say it amen right now we got people amen wanting to fly around in airplanes and bump around in the gifts a little bit amen and they're getting mad at people who are standing up saying amen but this is beyond Pentecost this is beyond their PL this is an astronaut listen I'm not the problem because I'm in an astronaut ship amen the problem is you've allowed Some Devil Amen to Blind your eyes to the reality that God has more for the church prob God say so does the spiritual astronaut he goes beyond the clouds he goes beyond the Creeds he goes beyond the doubt he goes out into outer space amen Beyond unbelief amen where there's no chatter chatter he said we are living in an astronaut age come on Church we're living in an astronaut age we have gone beyond just speaking in tongues come on we ought to be able to preach a little bit we've gone beyond just a feeling come on you all know I'm in the message you read it right you know brother stands there an astronaut and countdown and he stands there and preaches the countdown he comes in of in 1964 and discerns a woman's heart discerns the situation of her life discerns exact details and says now what do you need speaking in tongues for he said the word is in the church so oh God he said the word out now somebody take that and say praise God the tongues is out am then no the tongues is not out but a prophet put them in order they're not the leadership of the body amen the word is the headship to the church listen if you are a spiritual astronaut that means you're a part of an end time people and Peter said which according to of His abundant Mercy ha begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead Amen to an inheritance that is Incorruptible undefiled and that fadeth not away and it is reserved in heaven for you who are kept somebody shout who are kept amen they are kept by the power of God through faith and the salvation and they are ready to be revealed in the last time come on this message is more than just revealing the Mysteries it's the revealing of the end time people who will believe the Mysteries that's revealed in the season that you're living in what good does it do to reveal something if there's not somebody to follow it and somebody to believe it but if God revealed Malachi 4 that means somebody on the Earth has got eyes to see it if he revealed Revelation 10 if he revealed John 14 somebody somewhere oh Hallelujah Hallelujah that's got eyes to see they got ears to hear they got a heart to believe they got a mouth to confess come on and they got feet Amen to put some Footsteps in the land of inheritance Lord come on this inheritance is not reserved for you on the earth it's reserved in heaven hallelujah it's reserved in heaven which means if you're going to partake of it you got to get out of Earthly influences and get into heaven places now I love what he says who are kept somebody say kept they are kept by the power of God through faith and salvation and they are ready shout ready ready to be revealed in the last time says in this last in the closing section here L Us in church age he said we must seriously consider these two thoughts first this age will have one Prophet messenger how many one okay he says now watch Revelation 10:7 says when he singular shall begin to S there has never been an age where God gave his people two Major Prophets at one time so anybody tells you oh God I'm going get in trouble anybody tells you there's now a person taking brother's place Amen to lead the bridey on the world is an antichrist Spirit true he gave Enoch alone he gave Noah alone he gave Moses and he alone had the word though others prophesied amen there was John the Baptist came along now in this last day there is to be a prophet not a prophetess though in the age are more women according to give God's revelation than men but in the infallible word says that he the prophet will reveal the Mysteries to the Endtime people listen he will reveal the Mysteries to the end time people now watch and will turn the hearts of the children back to the father listen the revelation of the Mysteries is the Turning of the heart to the fathers can I say this the end time people the end time people will have eyes to see the end time Revelation if you are a part of that reserved group who are kept by the power of God through the spirit of God you will have eyes to see the revelation of the word living listen amen Noah didn't walk in Enoch's Revelation and Moses didn't walk in Noah's Revelation amen but Moses walked in Moses day and Enoch walked in Enoch's day and Noah walked in Noah's day well come on church amen I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ which is the wife of Ephesians 5 of the Lord Jesus Christ will walk in the word for her day yes sir now let me say this the revelation will come and by the Revelation coming it will turn the hearts of the children amen back to the faith of the fathers now you all know you can read it when you get home Revelation 5 you will read there that there says there is a book and that book is closed right but in Revelation 10 it says the book that was closed is now open now watch what the prophet says he said in Revelation 107 the great mystery of the book was to be unfolded by the seventh Angel's message so the seventh Angel's message is the unfolding of the mystery in the Great Book see what is that when the seals are broken The Mystery of the book is revealed can I say this to you amen Revelation is something that is made known of something are you with me amen Revelation is something that is made known of something it's not something you made up it's not something you Pro long enough until you thought this sounds good about this scripture No Revelation is something amen that is made known of something can I say this and the Revelation is closed until the last days but Malachi 4 will come and he will restore the revelation of the church and the very first revelation he's going to restore is that I am the Lord and I change not and he goes to Hebrews 138 and says that Jesus Christ is the same amen yesterday to today and forever he says that is the Keystone of the Bible it is the Revelation amen that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is amen can I just shout it to you tonight everything changes except God and his mind about his word listen politics are changing denominations are changing schools are changing religion is changing people's changing jobs everything is changing but you ought to be able to lift your hand and say thank God there is an unchangeable God there is an unchanging way there is a Vindicated method there is a reality of Jesus Christ among the church and here it is he's the same yesterday today and forever are you hearing me he's the same yesterday today and forever you say you're talking about a prophet lot I am it's Malachi 45 and 6 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great Dreadful day and he will turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the fathers lest th come and smout the Earth with a curse now I know somebody somebody say well heyen excuse me that was John the Baptist okay tell me one Revelation tell me one thing that John the Baptist restored he did not he turned the hearts of the fathers to the children but according to Malachi 4 there's got to come a message that will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers listen friends amen so God would send a prophet who was born underneath a pillar of fire which was the same Pillar of Fire that was with Moses that was with Paul amen has returned in this age and he stood on platforms around the world and listen over and over he says this Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever listen he was not standing there amen preaching in Easy atmospheres he was standing there preaching in cold amen iCal atmospheres that were Bound by the spirits of error Bound by the spirits of unbelief but he stood there and he said but I come here to say this Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever if he ever saved he's still saving if he ever healed he's still healing if he ever gave the Holy Ghost he's still giv the Holy Ghost if he ever raised the dead he's still able to raise the dead if he ever open blinded eyes he's still able he's the same yesterday today and forever amen where did he get that yeah a seminary a school a library a lecture he got it in the Bible that's right now I love what he says so we really believe that God never changed his mind about what he said he always keeps it true I want you to think about something a Prophet come among the church in an age where the spirit of error had people reading Mark 16 reading about the Widow of na son we reading about the Blind barus and about Gus's daughter the spirit of error literally had people reading those scriptures and saying this well the days and miracles are passed yeah exactly hello right reading the word of God and saying the days of Miracles are passed can I say something to you what it is is its Eve's interpreter returning among the church in the false interpretation of the word of God a few years ago brother brother Shawn Martin our pastor there in Virginia Amen brother Shawn Martin and maybe some of you know brother Sean amen we were out doing some meetings in Pennsylvania and we were there and there was a brother uh who host those meetings and he ran at a campground and so brother Sean was sitting on his porch one day and there was a guy sitting there I think it was maybe a uh I want to say maybe Church of Christ or Church of God something like that anyhow amen the the there was a cabin next to brother Sean's and there's a guy sitting on his porch and while he's sitting on his porch brother Shawn comes out and he says hey he says I see you all in our Campground for the week and he said yes sir he said well I got a question for you he said said what do you all believe brother Sean said well he said we're Full Gospel people we believe in all the Bible he said we believe in the revelation of Jesus Christ he said we believe that God sent a prophet and he said we believe in the in the power of revelation we believe in the power of Miracles he said we we believe in the Supernatural so here's a guy that sits there sitting on his porch he been believing that he's a Christian and he says these words he says you know I don't believe in the Supernatural he says I don't believe in all that Miracles and stuff he said now what do you he said now how do you all base that he said well if you brother Sean says if you're reading the Bible amen that in the Old Testament there was Miracles Amen in the New Testament there was Miracles he said so we believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now brother this is amazing to me is the man looks at brother Sean and he says you really believe Hebrews 13:8 that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he said yes sir I do he said do you realize that that scripture don't even make place or don't even make sense where it's chronologically placed in the Bible he said have you ever read Hebrews 13 brother son said yes he said have you ever read how this man asked him he said have you ever read how you're reading about all these social duties and spiritual duties and about marriage and then all of a sudden right there Amen in the middle of all that it says Jesus Christ amen is the same yesterday forever and then he says it picks right back up he said do you realize that historians and theologians have proved amen that Hebrews 13:8 is out of place in the Bible therefore it's not relevant to today I said my goodness and then this guy claiming to be a Christian claiming to be a follower of God is saying that God put something in his word that's out of order out of place and is not relevant to today you know what I I got to think about that brother Sean told me about it he said I looked at the man and I said well sir you've come too late to tell me that he said because do you see my daughter amen walking through the campground he said an was born without a hip socket he said she was up for a surgery he said but the Holy Ghost came by and we laid our hands upon her he said and God the Creator put a hip socket he said you'll see her this weekend amen she's not crippled amen she's walking on two good legs he said this entire Campground amen it's full of Miracles it's full of manifestations of the supernatural amen I got home and I got to ponder that brother Barry and ponder that and thinking about it amen How could somebody amen say that that is out a place well then I got to studying brother brandham and brother br's going along and he says now Paul wrote some powerful letters he said he wrote the Romans and the Corinthians and the Ephesians he said but to my Revelation he said the book of Hebrews is Paul's key letter I said oh God Amen he said it's Paul's key letter then I go to the church age book and he said here is the Keystone of the entire Bible that Hebrews 138 is Jesus Christ same yesterday today and forever I thought oh God Amen he's connecting Hebrews 138 Amen to a key well then I went to a sermon called a key to the door and B says these words he says if you need a key it's because the door is locked and he said there's something on the other side of the door amen that's worthwhile he said but what you do is you lock the door amen and you give somebody a key to unlock the door and to go into what is worthwhile I said Oh Glory to God I got to thinking amen any of y'all ever left your house and maybe somebody coming by or they're going to go in and check on the water check on the animals amen and what you do amen is you go hide a key underneath a rock or underneath a mat or underneath a bush or something amen now listen when you have that key amen sister Susan you don't go walking through the neighborhood saying hey hey everybody I'm leaving town amen I'm leaving my house I'm going away for two weeks there's a key underneath the match if you want to go in the key no you don't tell the entire neighborhood because that key is not for the entire neighborhood it's for one predestinated [Applause] [Music] person it's for one person that you have chosen to go into your house so what you do is you call them on the phone and you secretly tell them where the key is you say it's underneath the mat it's underneath the rug it's underneath a rock amen and they go get the key as a chosen one and they go into to what is locked behind the door I got to thinking about that amen here is theologians and they're trying to probe into Revelation they're trying to probe into the mysteries of God they're trying to probe into the Rapture they're trying to prob and into all these things amen but they don't have the key amen but God sends a prophet a simple Hill belly born in the hills of Kentucky and he walks behind a pull pit and says Church here's where the key is it's Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever listen friends you ain't got to stay on the outside tonight you have been authorized by the power of the Seal of God to go into every Divine promise you ain't got to stay out of healing tonight you can move into it you ain't got to stay out of Joy tonight you can move into it you ain't got to stay out of Revelation tonight you can move into it you ain't got to stay out of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the anointing of God you can move into it tonight yes sir if the word of God never changes can I say this The Works of God Don't Change John 10:37 if I do not the works of my father then believe me not but if I do yes if I do though ye believe not me believe the work that you may know and believe that the father is in me and IU in him so I ask you a question what is the works of God oh yes the father of God said I truly believe the works of God has many phases to it I believe church is a work of God missionary is a work of God evangelist is a work of God but Above All Soul Saving is the works of God Amen Divine Healing is the works of God the gifts of the Spirit is the work of God it could be talked on many different Outlets but listen but Healing The Sick is not the sign of the Messiah for the prophets healed the sick before the Messiah come and in this last days Healing The Sick in this great Revival Divine Healing is not one of the outstanding signs of the coming of Jesus for we've had Divine Healing through 2,000 years right amen since the going way of the Messiah at Pentecost or Jerusalem and the r return of him again but there was a sign can I can I have your attention there was a sign that was the sign of the Messiah and the closing of the age so the the Messiah sign appears at the closing of the age so in the last days or the closing of the age amen The Works of God and the works of the devil are going to be revealed 1 John 3:8 see he that committed sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose purp the Son of God was manifested for this purpose was the son of God manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil so the Son of God was manifested that the works of the devil might be destroyed look at this word destroyed it means to loose it means to let go from bondage so the works of the devil had gripped Humanity but the manifestation of the son of God was the destroying of the works of the devil Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil is that right you believe that what was he God's word which destroys the works of the hybrid the devil he was done to do that he was born to be that Amen to destroy the works of the devil how many will raise your hand and agree that Jesus Christ the son of God was born to destroy the works of the devil he was born to destroy The Works of the devil now can I say this a prophet turns a corner and says now his body is to do the same now you raised your hand that he was born amen but now can you raise your hand and say but I was born as well Amen to destroy the works of the devil listen somebody's going to destroy cancer somebody's going to destroy depression somebody is going to destroy the Antichrist Spirit somebody is going to destroy Le somebody is going to tear down the devil's Kingdom he was born now he is born his body do the same because the head and the body is together that's right if Christ is the head hallah which was the word then his body has to be the same thing as his head [Applause] was so his head will not be Victorious and his body defeated his head will not have authority and his body be walking under under guessing but if the head was Victorious then the body will be victorious if the head was an overcomer then the body will be an overcomer if the head was the word come on church if the head was the word then the body will be the word as well see a church of the word born of the word he said not denom now virgin born from the word the way the body operates is by the head now says this and you all know this there were three pools right there was the first pool which was healing there was the second pool which was prophesied which broke out into a discernment right but then there was a third pull which was the opening of the word the revealing Mysteries if there's any questions amen you'd be glad to talk to me or brother Barry amen we we're not just making these things up says the Holy Spirit giving the gift of going forth of discerning spiritual things now listen they come through healing everybody shouted at the healing right you you go on YouTube or go on on Wikipedia and read about the prophet and they say my he was big in healing he was a he was the forefather he was the uh the uh one of the uh founding fathers of the he healing campaign revivals broke out in the 40s and the 50s Amen in the 60s amen now you watch they all rallied around the healing remember the sign in the hand amen God bless you brother murin good to see you amen amen they rallied around the the sign of the hand amen but then he goes from the sign of the hand to the deser of spirit and he could stand on a platform and tell people what they were thinking what they had been through what color of hair the kid had what type of doctor was talking am because he broke into that furtherance of the ministry and so now they said man God was with him in the healing now let's go in the prophesying under the discernment he said but there was something greater coming he said see there was a third pull which would be the open of the word of the revealing Mysteries he said now listen you went forth with me in the discernment of spirit and things he said but now it's come to the place where I want to tell you the truth about things right oh God so under the third pull is where he begin to tell the truth about marriage and divorce under the third pull is where he told the truth about MDC under the third P come on church amen under the first and second pull he preached Revelation 61 and2 as the Christ amen the white horse rider but under the third pole is where his spirit of God corrected him and he said it's not the Christ it's the Antichrist he said see so what was it it was the son of man which is Christ the head returned at the Clos of the age or at the changing of dispensations to identify the body by Revelation listen your pull was not the first pull your pull was not the second pull but your pull was the third pull which was made known under the opening of the word the revealing of the son of man can you prove that by the Bible Luke 17:30 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed brother says revealed or made known see the son of man Ministry may say the son of man Ministry it can only go to a certain type of people he said you understand why a Ministry like this can't go to the full can only go to the Full Gospel people when something struck my heart I had discernment that that was the word of God he made it manifest amen there's a revelation written in Mysteries like this to the outside world to the world knows nothing about it but you precious Brethren and you precious sister you are not children of the darkness you're not Children of the Night you're Children of the light walking in the light as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another can I can I say this to you amen walk in the light is his like listen then we have Fellowship one with another while the blood of Jesus Christ God's son cleanses us all our sins there you are you are Servants of the Lord try the spirit now I'll say this to you in closing and maybe we'll pick it up in the morning the seventh age is a very busy age it's an age when both spirits will be revealed and will be manifested in other words it's the time when the spirits will be revealed they'll be made known but there'll be somebody on the earth to discern them in other words the time has come that the devil can no longer get away with doing what he wants to for years he ran free yes for years he did what he wanted to do come on now he taught what he wanted to taught teach right he promoted what he wanted to promote but in the end time underneath the message of Malachi 4 Revelation 10 Luke 17 the word would be restored to the church spiritual discernment would come back can I say this to you y'all got y all got your your table at go listen to them we are he he preaches the great warrior David one night follows it up with the great warrior John Joshua I'm going to get on Joshua in the morning maybe Lord willing but I want to close on David he says there's David he says David was a warrior he was elected chosen anointed and placed he said now listen he said there were Goliath he said now if there are goliaths then there are some Davids if there are goliaths then there are some Davids now I want you to remember what he said he said the Antichrist Spirit would come in the church church and would defile the church would make it lukewarm cold formal and Powerless right would make it formal cold lukewarm and powless he said but God's spirit would come to the true people who had true Revelation and they would discern can I say this they would discern and amen amen hallelujah withstand so we're not just Discerning the spirit but we're actually withstanding the spirit somebody say what do you mean well David walked out there and he said who is this uncircumsized philistin that would defy the armies of the Living God do you know the problem of God said right there David discerned Goliath he identified that the spirit motivating this man was a was a devil to defy the Living God but you know what David didn't do he didn't walk out there and say oh there's there's Goliath and he's come to defy the armies of the and cross his arms and go back in and sit down and say somebody go fight him no David discerned him David judged him David scrutinized him David examined him David proved that the spirit behind Goliath was a spirit from the pits of hell and he said listen I will not lay down and let this uncircumcised Philistine amen defy the Living God you know what David done when he said he's an uncircumcised Philistine he discerned Goliath but when he went over there and got his slingshot and he picked up five smooth Stones Hallelujah he picked up five smooth Stones he is no longer just Discerning Goliath he's now withstanding Goliath he's now saying listen here buddy you've defied the wrong remember said those words fell on the wrong ears he said David picked up five smooth Stones he said he got that slingshot and he be to sling it you know what I love I love what the prop of God said he said David danced his way amen R into the battle come on David didn't stand there and walk with his head down David didn't walk in there depressed David didn't walk in there confused he walked in there as a warrior he walked in there as an overcomer brother said he danced his way amen right into the battle listen David knew Goliath was going to fall before he slung one stone he knew Goliath was coming down before he slung one Stone Church of the Living God I think it's time to put our dancing shoes on I think it's time to quit running from the battle I think it's time to S crying over the battle I think it's time to dance right into the face of the Antichrist spirit with an anointed Revelation and say you chose the wrong group devil you chose the wrong Church we're not here believing every Spirit we have received a keystone we can discern the spirit hallelujah hallelujah that Goliath's got to come down that Goliath has got to come down what are you saying preacher I'm saying this conquer your Goliath you now have the Revelation to do it the two Spirits are close but greater is he that's in you amen amen than he that's in the world let our musicians come tonight I believe it I believe both Spirits have been revealed amen I believe both Spirits have been revealed the spirit of God and the spirit of the Antichrist I believe the spirit of God is here calling his church how by vindicating the promised word of the age we're living in how's the devil calling his church by the spirit of error but hereby know we the spirit of God amen hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error can I just say this to you the Antichrist was dreading the time of the seventh angel that's right because Daniel said thou old Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end for many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased listen knowledge shall be increased another other words they're going to run to and fro and knowledge is going to increase but there will be no Authority by the word to defeat the Devil but when a prophet comes among the church he goes over in the Bible and he finds the Keystone he finds the key Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and you know what he says he says and any spirit that contradicts that is a seed of discrepancy that's right right amen any spirit that says Jesus Christ is not the same yesterday Dan forever is a seed of discrepancy he said now what is discrepancy he says it means to say something contrary to what's already been said come on Friends the word of God was said years before brother Brandon was born brother BR didn't write the Bible he come and revealed the Bible amen but you know what he did he took this Bible right here and he didn't say one thing contrary to what had already been said he said here oh Israel the Lord our God is one God he said man is saved by the blood atonement somebody say well you've lost your mind no I had I'm dressed right you know why the devil hates you it's because you're not just talking about your author Authority you're wearing itall you're not just talking about your position you're wearing your Authority remember the Bible said that Jesus was actually speaking in the temple and the scribes and Pharisees were astonished remember that they were astonished at his Doctrine because they said these words they said he spoke as one having Authority he spoke as one having not looking for having Authority I got to looking at that word having one day brother Barry and I found the definition of it the word having is related to one wearing I said dear God somebody wearing their Authority and then I got to thinking where the proud of God said these words he said oh if I can just get her to stand still long enough I'll dress her I'll dress her in the clothe of the word of God y'all remember the book of Isaiah I think it's Isaiah 4 and verse1 the Bible said in the last days there would be seven women he said they would say these things they would say we'll eat our own food we'll wear our own clothes he said but we just want your name he said to Bear to remove the reproach so in other words they didn't want to eat spiritual food in due season and they didn't want to wear the garments of the word they wanted his name his authority to remove their reproach I got to to studying that one day and it dawned on me amen whenever you go somewhere amen you got to be dressed for the occasion listen amen if you go to a ball game you don't go out there to play quarterback in a suit and tie come on am mean if you go to Rodeo am mean you don't go you don't go get on a bull and ride a bull Amen in a c or in a in a in a a football uniform amen you wear the clothes appropriate to the occasion listen friends do you realize amen that when God robe someone in authority he changes their clothes I want you to catch something Isaiah 4:1 they said we'll eat our own bread and we we'll wear our own clothes but we'll take your name but you realize in Luke 15 the Bible says amen that there was a prodal come home and the Bible says the prodal come home and before he went to supper amen the father changed his [Applause] clothes the father said listen bring forth the best robe and put a pair of shoes upon his feet and put a ring upon his hand for this my son was lost but he is now found and then they went to supper hey before they ate they changed their clothes I got to read the Revelation the Bible says amen that unto her was granted fine linen clean and white amen and the fine linen is the righteousness of God which is the righteousness of the Saints amen they changed the clothes and the very next lines amen and she went to the married supper of the Lamb listen friends if you have been called amen by the Vindication of the Holy Ghost in the message of the hour he has changed your clothes you're no longer wearing doctrines of man and ideas of the Antichrist you're wearing the Robes of authority hallelujah hallelujah somebody say I'm dressed for supper Hallelujah won't you stand to your feet tonight I believe it thank you I believe the word I believe the word I believe it is dress the bride I believe she's clothed she's not clothed with man's ideas she's clothed with a revelation yesen that Revelation is God is unchanging his ways are unchanging Hallelujah his word is unchanging amen his power is unchanging amen how many say tonight Lord I Want A Spiritual Awakening Amen to spiritual discernment amen you know tonight I'll say this brother said you can have the right act with the wrong discernment he said and that's what changes it he said you see what's happened is churches they've put the church above the word he says but in reality the word is above the church that's right so because the church says it's okay people say it's okay but it don't matter what the word says but in the last days God would hide a [Music] key when he had Paul writing Hebrews Paul underneath the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and he's writing about this and he comes down to Hebrews 13 13:7 and he says let your conversation be this at the end of all matters and Paul's writing along and he stops him and he says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and Paul goes right on writing they've debated the book of Hebrews for years they've argued who wrote it they've argued where it come from they've argued if it even should be in the Bible or not but God would send a prophet and he would turn over there and he would find it he would pull it out and he would say now here you go here's your key to the rapture amen here's your key to the to the Millennium thank you Lord Jesus Christ and he said you take the church and put it under the word don't you put the word under the church you put the word over the church and if it don't line up with God's word you walk away from it you love him tonight how many can say Lord give me that discernment not to stand up and call people out tell them what they had for breakfast what color carpet they got in their house and what color no give me that discernment Lord to look at something and see the spirit is it God the Holy Spirit or is it the devil the spirit of error right and brother BR said prove all things he said in other words when it's proven right hold fast to it he said get a grip on it he said don't turn it loose he said if it's proven wrong he said drop it right fast how many tonight could say Lord I want to do that you know sometimes you get a grip on things right and the word of God begins to be preached and you got a grip on that and the word begins to go forth yes listen if you're a part of this end time revelation when the word proves what you got a hold of is wrong you'll drop it right I can stop preach all over again right here people get a hold of things right and a spirit of error proves to them it's okay and the spirit of Truth proves it's wrong and they argue with the spirit of truth but I raise my hands tonight and I say Lord when your word proves it's wrong I'll drop it amen amen amen am when your word proves a Doctrine I'm believeing is wrong I'll drop it when I believe something and a prophet says something contrary to what I believe and he shows it to me by the word what I believe is gone I got to stay with his word you love him tonight amen almighty God we bow our hearts in your presence tonight Lord L father as we come here tonight Lord to the close of this service Lord amen father laying some thought out from your word that Lord you would send a prophet in this age Lord he would come among the church not to promote himself not to promote another idea but Lord to have the courage Christian spiritual courage spiritual deser Lord to stand in the face of the enemy Amen to stand in the face of the spirit of error and say listen that's wrong that's wrong and that's wrong Lord as I heard him today standing there in 1955 in Los Angeles preaching on the Seal of the Antichrist and he says here the other day a teaching broke Out Among the people that a baby that's born from holy parents that are believers and dies before it comes to age of accountability to be reborn he said they teach that baby could be lost he said then they're teaching this other Doctrine about a baby that's born of Unholy parents and it's it don't come to the age of accountability it's lost he said that's so wrong he said now here's the truth of it Lord as I sat there in the motel room I couldn't help but just thank you Lord I Thank you for sending the spirit of truth among the church Lord to bring us away from the condemnation of religion from the condemnation of man's ideas Lord that you would reserve a people unto yourself that when this Revelation would begin to come when it would begin to break on the church there would be eyes to see it Lord Lord there would be ears to hear it father Lord there would be people that would submit themselves they would surrender theirselves holy and fully to the word of God lord I want to raise my hands before you tonight and say Lord don't ever let me get to a spot that something can be proven wrong and I'll hold on to it in the face of what's been proven M right Lord give me the grace to do as your Prophet said and drop it real quick and Let It Go Lord if it goes against my feelings let me Let It Go Lord your word is above my feelings if it goes above the emotions of the crowd let me Let It Go Lord your word is above the emotions of the crowd Lord I want to hold your word I want to hold your word and your word alone father I want to hold this message I
