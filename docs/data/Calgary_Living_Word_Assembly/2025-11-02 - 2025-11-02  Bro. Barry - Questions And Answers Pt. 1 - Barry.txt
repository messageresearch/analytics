I just love the songs of Fanny Crosby. But the Lord the Lord just I put this on my heart. What can wash away our sin? [music] Aren't you glad for the blood of Jesus this morning? &gt;&gt; Nothing nothing stands in the way of that blood. I plead the blood [music] every single day when I'm down on my knees just before going to bed. &gt;&gt; I said, "Lord, would you cover me once more? &gt;&gt; Would you cover my family?" &gt;&gt; Like to Job, cover my family with that precious blood. The prophet talked about that bumper of blood. Remember when he was criticizing [music] that lady and God showed him that bumper blood and said, "That's your sin." &gt;&gt; There's a prophet of God that needed the [music] bumper blood. How much for us? &gt;&gt; Let's sing it this morning with Revelation. Well, what can wash [music] away my sin? Nothing but the blood of Jesus. [music] Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] [singing] Heat.

How could the blood do that? Well, it's not the physical blood. It's the life in the blood. How does it give me strength? Well, not the blood. It's not a physical sample of it, but the spirit that was in it. It's called the Holy Ghost. It's called the Holy Ghost. That's what gives us strength. Blessed be his name this morning. Stand with me if you would. Going to sing that once more as the deacons come this morning. Well, it reaches [singing] to the highest [music] mountain [singing and music] when you come. Oh, that same blood that gives me strength from day [music] [singing] to day. [music] God bless you saints. We have a promise. We have a blood. &gt;&gt; It doesn't lose its power. Let's pray. Our dear heavenly father, what a privilege. What an honor this morning to know that you came to die for us, Lord. &gt;&gt; And the same blood doesn't lose its power. This morning, Father, we are here once again in your name &gt;&gt; to worship you, Lord, &gt;&gt; to transform our lives, Lord Jesus, by the hearing of the word, Lord. Father, we don't want to have any mixed signals that we are believers and sometimes we are doing otherwise. So, we ask you to help us, Lord, &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; to leave the word that we believe this morning, Father. That is why we have come here Lord that you help us to perfect our lives Lord to reflect you. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; we want to thank you once again for this great opportunity given to us to assemble in your name. Lord, we've come with individual needs. Lord, we've come with our praises and our worship. Lord, we've come as we are. Lord, &gt;&gt; some are sick, but they made it here because they know that you are going to be here this morning because you promised to be here. &gt;&gt; Some have come to bring their thanksgiving because they traveled and they are home and they want to come and say, "Lord, thank you for your travel mercy." Father, this morning once again, &gt;&gt; as your word is coming to us, Lord, may we have a place in our hearts to receive the word, Lord. If we have done anything wrong, Father, this morning, which we are, we ask you to forgive us this morning as we approach you once again. Bless each and everyone that made the effort to come here this morning. Those that could not make it for whatever reason, may you bless them as well. Father, we have many here and you have a servant that is going to come here and speak to us, Lord. I pray that Lord you help him Lord that we can have something from what he has for us this morning. Lord we know that Lord you can provide for each and everyone here. &gt;&gt; How do we know that even the birds in the air before you created them before you formed them they are going to stand on the electric line and not be electrocuted? You know it before the foundation of the world. That is why you provided something for them to hold the electric lines and not be electrocuted. And the same God that we serve this morning, you are able to provide for each and everyone that is meeting here this morning. We serve that God this morning. Only if we can believe you. Help us to believe you this morning. Once again, Father, we are bringing our tithes and offering. We pray that Lord, you receive it. Pray for brother Paul and the song the musicians behind me. They are doing their best. May we tap into that gift &gt;&gt; for in Jesus name that we pray over this offering. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you brother Peter. Oh Lord, I come to you today. Oh, with a simple [singing] prayer to pray. [music] Oh, that's [singing] in it. everything [music] that I do. Oh, [music] let my eyes, oh Lord, [music] praise you. Yes, Lord. Oh, let it praise [music] you, Lord. Praise you. [music] Oh, let [music] [singing] praise [music] you. Praise you, [music] Lord. Praise you. [music] Oh, let my [music] [singing] oh Lord praise [music] you. May you have your seats this morning as we sing the second verse. Ask brother Dawn to come. Lord, [singing] you for [music] me now of clay for [music] your glory I was made. Is this our prayer now? Oh, use this [music] face. So, you choose. [music] Oh, let [music] praise you. Oh, praise [singing] you. [music] [music and singing] Praise [music and singing] you. [music] [music] Let my heart [music] praise [music] you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Beautiful. After Friday night's service, I was just so inspired and so encouraged that on my way home, I messaged Brother Paul. I'm like, "Brother Paul, I have to do a special on Sunday." Okay. So, this is a word of encouragement for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This poem is called Born to Overcome. &gt;&gt; I think this is something that we always need to remember and focus on. Before the dawn had kissed the world, before the stars took flame, he knew your heart. He called your soul. He spoke and wrote your name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His word was planted deep within his life. You're a living son. You always was. You always are a child born to overcome. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're here for a purpose. It's to overcome all of the struggles and trials of this life. &gt;&gt; And you can do it. &gt;&gt; Just surrender to him. &gt;&gt; When you first breathe that newborn air and learn to walk and fall, his hand was near. Though you knew not the one who guided all through childhood dreams and wandering steps, his light would softly come. For deep within, the seed declared, "You're born to overcome." &gt;&gt; You chased the world. You played its games. You sought its fleeting prize. But mercy found you &gt;&gt; where you fell and opened up your eyes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Though you were lost in shadows hold, his purpose still would run. For what was sown before all time, must rise to overcome. Amen. &gt;&gt; In youth you stumbled, failed, and wept. Your pride would rise and fade. Yet every fall just proved again the work his hand has made. For even when you turned away and doubted what he done, the seed of God within your soul was growing to overcome. &gt;&gt; Then grace revealed the cross to you, our Savior's crimson plan. The word made flesh, the spotless lamb, the sun became your stand. And when you saw his victory through blood and spirit won, &gt;&gt; you knew &gt;&gt; that you're chosen by him &gt;&gt; and born to overcome. &gt;&gt; Now daily life becomes our ground where faith and patience grow and quiet work in simple ways. This kingdom starts to show. Each choice we make, each word we speak, each battle faced and won reveals the life that's in the seed. The life that overcomes. No storm can shake what God has swn. No trial turns us back. For every test just proves his strength and keeps us on the tracks. The spirit leads through calm and flame till all his will be done. And we reflect our father's life. His nature overcomes. So we will praise him all our days &gt;&gt; through fire, joy, and rain. &gt;&gt; For we were his before the world, &gt;&gt; and ever shall remain. &gt;&gt; The seed he spoke before all time [snorts] will shine like morning sun. For we are born of God himself and here to overcome. &gt;&gt; Lord bless you all. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, my brother. Brother Farah, would you come? I was thinking of the of the two gifts. Here's brother Don with an amazing gift of poetry. Those of you who've been around for a long time know how many poems he's recited. I don't know if we have a collection of them, but they're incredible and they're they're they're inspired, very uniquely [music] inspired. And then we have a brother Faren that can sing like an angel. So somehow it's amazing what God does. He brings that gift and then this gift. So brother Faren, God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you everyone. Why should [singing and music] I feel discoura? [singing] Should my heart [singing] feel [music] on me and for heaven and then [singing and music] Jesus is my [singing] Grand is [music] his [singing] eyes on the sparrow and I know [singing and music] he watches me. I sing [music] [singing] because I'm happy. I sing [singing] because I'm [music] free his eyes on [music] the spell. [singing] And [music] I know he watches me. [singing] &gt;&gt; Now let not [singing] your heart [music] be troubled. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; He [singing] tender word I he [music] and [singing] resting on his goodness I begin to [singing and music] lose all my doubts and fears. go by the path you [singing] lead. But one step by [singing] mercy, [music] his eyes [singing] on the sparrow. [singing] [music] And I know he watches me. [singing] [music] His eyes [singing] on the spiral and I [singing] know he watches [music] me. You can join us and swing the cross again. Oh, [singing] I see [music] the &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. [singing] I see [music] &gt;&gt; because I'm free. Oh, [singing] he's on the [music and singing] sorrow. Oh, yes. And I know he [music and singing] watches me. &gt;&gt; Let's sing this last one together. Whenever I am tempted, [music and singing] whenever [music] the [singing] clouds arise, [music] when [singing] songs give place to sign, [music] when [singing] hope within me [music] die. I draw [singing] closer to him [music and singing] from care. He set his free. [music and singing] his eyes on the spiral. [singing] And I know [singing and music] he watches me. His eyes [singing] on the sparrow and know [music and singing] he watches me. All together let's sing. I sing because of I [singing] sing.

[singing] [music] His eyes on the [singing] spir. [music] And I know [singing] he watches [music] over me. [singing] Just one more song today. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand. [applause] Thank you. Josh. [applause] Amen. Amen. Just one more part. I have the song in mind. I'm just going to use a backing track here. If you've been asking God for something, this song is an encouragement for you to pray on. &gt;&gt; Pray on. The end is near, nearer than you think. Amen. Go ahead. The army [singing] of Judah was paralyzed by fear when they heard a [singing] mighty multitude was quickly drawing near. But [music] as they prayed [singing] for deliverance, the victory would begin. For when we call [singing and music] upon the Lord, we summon all of heaven. Pray on for you [singing and music] are who the Lord is looking for. Pray on for this will Jesus mighty strongholds down. Stay on [singing] your knees for this is where the battle is won. Very soon you [music and singing] win the victory. Pray on. When Daniel faced the lions for worshiping [music and singing] the Lord, it seemed there was no hope at all for what will be [singing] in store. [music] But when we stand on holy ground, our smallest praise is [singing] heard. Instead of forest circumstances, our eyes on the Lord. [singing] Pray on for you are who the Lord is looking [music] for. Ray on. See, tear them mighty strongholds down. Stay on your knees for this is where the battle is won. Very soon you'll win the victory. Pray on now. When your questions go unanswered [music and singing] and your prayers may seem in vain, they don't seem to make a difference. They don't seem to make a change. Just rest assured. God knows your needs and he is each time you pray. Your prayers are reaching heaven and the answers [singing] on the way. Pray on [music] for you are who the Lord is looking for. Pray on tear the mighty [singing] struggles down. Stay on your knees for this is where the battle is won. There's no better place for you [music] to be than seeking the father prayerfully. Very soon you'll win the victory. Oh, [singing] pray on. [music] Oh, pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Farah, brother Dylan. Just wonderful encouragements to us this morning. Wonderful to have the gifts that we have in the body this morning and just just how faithful the Lord is. I'm just thinking as you were singing, Brother Pharah, the scripture says when you don't have an all to stand, just stand. &gt;&gt; The prayer seems to go unanswered. It's not being unanswered. It's being answered. &gt;&gt; Maybe a little different than we want it to be. But just stand. Just stand with the word. God bless you. Stand as if you would if with me if you would. &gt;&gt; Let's sing this song. Lord, I want to love you more as our pastor comes. I think [music] my desire I've said this for a couple of years now. Maybe just the Lord just put it on my heart, but my entire intention for coming to church is to [music] leave one just to leave loving him more. Like if I feel like the through the ministry of the word, [music] &gt;&gt; through the gathering together, that that's how I leave. I believe the Lord's pleased for me. I need to leave here loving [music] him more. Trust you do as well. That's what he desires. He's a He's a He's an incredible husband. Just so incredible in every way. It's us that fail, but he never holds us down. He's not that kind of husband. He's not an abusive father. He's [music] none of that. He's loving. He's encouraging. And here we are this morning. We're here to receive from him. &gt;&gt; And boy, when the word comes forth, let's just pull on it because it's trans it's transforming. It will literally transform each of us. Let's sing it this morning. Lord, Lord, [singing and music] I want to love you more. [singing] [music] More than I ever have before. [music] You're so easy to adore. Is that the truth? Lord, I want to love you more. [music] I just want to serve you. Lord, I want to serve you more. [music and singing] More than I [music] ever have before. [music] You're so easy [singing] to adore. Lord, [music] I want to serve you. I want to know you more. [music] And I want [singing] to know you more. More than [music] I ever have before. [music] You're so easy to adore. [music] Oh Lord, I want to know you more. [music] I want to know you more. Lord, I want to know you more. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; So easy to adore. Lord, I [music] want to [singing] know you more. I want to love you more. You want to love him more. Lord, I want [music] to love you more than [music] I ever have before. [music] You're so easy to adore, Lord. I want to [music] love you. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. Welcome to the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Is it on? Sometimes I can hear it, sometimes I can't. We're certainly thankful to be gathered together one more time in the name above every name. That is our provided place of worship. &gt;&gt; We certainly are thankful for our visitors in our midst. Uh God richly bless you. Um our friends from Texas. God bless you. &gt;&gt; We uh it's sorry it's uh I think it's is it brother op your brother right? And his wife his family. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Welcome. Um yeah, [applause] visiting from the Lone Star State. Um we'd also just like to warmly welcome uh the Kikuis in our midst um after the passing of their mama and grandma. You know, it's just been a week since she crossed over into glory and certainly thankful for her testimony and the life that she lived and &gt;&gt; the word says to train the children up in the way they should go. &gt;&gt; And it won't depart from them. And &gt;&gt; certainly thankful to see you here today and we trust &gt;&gt; that you want to love the Lord more through it. &gt;&gt; We know that the the trials of this life are not easy. And when we lose a loved one, that's a hole that can never be filled on this side of eternity. There's no getting over it. There's not even really getting used to it. It's just learning how to live with the new normal. And uh we certainly already miss Sister Gmaine, but we know she's in glory. &gt;&gt; And you know, we have the promise that we'll see her again. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we just want to hold that promise close to our hearts for every one of our lives. We all [music] have loved ones that have gone on and uh we just certainly trust the Lord. If you have a need this morning, maybe just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer. Our gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank you for this another opportunity, Lord, to worship in your provided space, Lord, in the age in which we live. Father, we don't take it for granted or count it lightly. We know that you're here in our midst, Father. And this is another opportunity, Lord, to worship you &gt;&gt; in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like never before, Lord Jesus. We've been given the whole entire book open to us. And if we would just be willing to allow you to reveal it to us, Father, it would become a new book to our lives. it would change our bodies from the inside out. And Father, this morning, one more time, we just invite you, Lord, to have the preeminence in the words that are spoken. Lord, we already know you're here according to your word because that's your will. And Father, we just esteem that greater than any thought or any tradition or any idea. We esteem your will greater than anything we could imagine. And Lord Jesus, we just accept it the way that you've given it to us. Lord, &gt;&gt; and Father, we pray that your will would be done even in this service this morning, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, that hearts would be changed. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, that we none of us, myself included, Lord, that we wouldn't leave this building the same way that we came in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, that you would draw us closer unto you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, our desire is to hear from you. And Lord, I pray that you would just help every one of us to get out of the way and just give you the preeminence, give you the leadership, give you the headship as our husband, Lord, as a husband desires. &gt;&gt; That when you speak, Father, we would hear it. Not just with our ears, but with our heart. &gt;&gt; Father, we love you and we thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We pray that you would meet each and every need, Lord, that was made known unto you today by the way of an uplift hand. Father, maybe some that weren't even mentioned, Father, that weren't even acknowledged. Lord, we pray that you would sovereignly meet the needs in the hearts of your children. &gt;&gt; We pray, Lord, that you would be with all those who are traveling, Lord Jesus. Some in Ireland, Father, some in Nigeria, Lord Jesus. Oh, maybe some locally around here, Father. Lord Jesus, we also want to remember the the persecution of your Christians, Lord Jesus, all around the world, Father, to think that, Lord, they're persecuted because of your name's sake. We know that that is what you said in your word. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; But, Father, to think that they are giving their lives even still today. We pray for those families. We pray for the congregations, Lord, that are enduring those dark trials. Father, we don't know what tomorrow holds, but we know that you have it in your complete control, Lord Jesus. And we trust you like that. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to remember each and every person here this morning, Father. Those that might be in person, maybe some are tuning in, Father, and maybe some would watch afterwards. Father, &gt;&gt; whatever your will is, Lord, we pray that you would sovereignly speak to our hearts today, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, we love you and we thank you. We just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you musicians. Thank you so much once again for putting your shoulders to the wheel. If you have your Bibles, I'd like to read from St. John chapter 4. &gt;&gt; St. John chapter 4 today. We'll just start with uh start with the verse verse 21 of St. John chapter 4. Jesus saith unto her,"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem worship the Father." Ye worship, ye know not what we wor, sorry, ye worship, ye know not what we know what we worship, &gt;&gt; for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the Father seeketh such to worship him. And God is a spirit. And they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh, which is called Christ. When he has come, he will tell us all things. &gt;&gt; Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Turn over into the book of Revelations with me. Revelation chapter 10. What we would call a very familiar scripture I believe dovetales with what we just read. Revelations 10 verse 7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As he hath declared to his servants, the prophets. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly Father, we're so thankful that the mystery about you is finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, we know that it's just a gleaning time. Father, your prophet said that he doesn't see anything left for the gentile church except for the rapture back in 1965. And here we are, Lord Jesus, this many years down the road. We know that the days are coming very, very short. And that's why the devil is going about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. Oh Lord Jesus, beguiling silly women. Oh father, help us to just be obedient sons and daughters. Help us to take your word into our heart. Father, that Lord Jesus, we could hide it there that we might not sin against you. &gt;&gt; We just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. You may be seated. Just uh want to announce brother Cadre Diggs will be here November the 22nd at 6 PM and uh November the 23rd at 10:00 a.m. And I would just like to kindly remind everyone if you don't mind just hit that mute button on your phone. Let's not have them ringing and distracting while we're in the presence of the King. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's easy to happen and uh to be honest, I've I've had it happen. So, just a friendly reminder. But the cadre digs will be here Saturday, November the 22nd at 6:00 p.m. and uh Sunday, November the 23rd at 10:00 a.m. And uh we've got the graduation celebration coming up. That's going to be in uh June, Saturday, June 27th, 2026. That'll be at 6 PM at the Glenmore Inn and uh we're starting to firm up details which is really nice. Uh we have the graduate dinners will be covered by the church. We're happy to do that in celebration of the graduates. And as we've mentioned in the past, we'll continue to mention it. It's for the people who have graduated high school and those people who have a post-secary degree or diploma that did not celebrate with the church. We certainly would like to uh appreciate you. So, um anyone else who would like to attend, it's looking like the tickets will likely be $30 each and we'll have a banquet. It'll be at the Glenmore Inn, Lord willing. Are you happy this morning? &gt;&gt; We uh we have uh a pretty amazing time that we live in looking at what's going on in this world. And you know um just so you kind of know my direction today. I plan to get into some questions and answers. We had mentioned this in the past and uh it the offer is always open. If anybody has a question, there has to be an answer to the question and we certainly would like to to bring that opportunity to you. If you do have a question, if there's a spiritual question, there has to be a spiritual answer. &gt;&gt; That's that's the way we believe. That's what we believe. and we're certainly thankful for that. So, we have had uh probably six or seven questions come in and I don't want to just flippantly try and answer them. I want to meditate on them and think about them and see what the prophet said about them and see what the word says about them because if there is a scriptural question, there has to be a scriptural answer. So, we're talking about scriptural questions is what we want to answer this way. If if it's maybe just a church matter, uh we can have a conversation about it. if it's the functionality of the church, but if it's a scriptural question, by all means, we want to have uh uh uh just submit it. And I've had some come in the form of text messages, and some are written on the offering or not the offering, the prayer request um sheets. So, you could just drop those in the offering uh bag if you wanted to. But where there's a a question, there has to be an answer. And uh so, anyways, that's kind of where we're going to go today. I just want to uh I guess maybe start out with just making it perfectly clear. Really what we're after as the bride of Jesus Christ, as the the church in the day in which we live, is to understand that the mystery of God is finished according to Revelation chapter 10. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, when we have a mystery still around, when you hear people talking about mysterious things around this message, I want to say that the devil's not afraid to come to church. The devil is not afraid to actually come right inside the framework of the message because we know that brother Random said it very clearly that the the Antichrist spirit, what's the antichrist spirit? &gt;&gt; It's not just a human. It's the devil. Yes, &gt;&gt; just call it what it is. It's the devil. And that's the most religious spirit that there is. The Antichrist spirit is going to get in to the framework of the Christian church. And it's going to cause it to become lukewarm, formal, and powerless. And we read the church age book as a church. And if you have any questions about how that will happen, I'll tell you, we'll summarize it in a real easy format. It's going to happen. It is happening all around the world. Even while we speak right now, that's happening. The Antichrist spirit is creeping its way into the Christian church, causing it to become lukewarm, formal empowers. And the way it's doing it is through politics, &gt;&gt; politics, &gt;&gt; men in the church trying to dictate the way the church should be run. Maybe it's women in the church, and we're going to get into that in the future. &gt;&gt; The dominating female spirit, the Thotyan spirit is alive and well. That's the age we live in. And you know, many times that happens. And I I heard a brother preaching and I was just saying, "Amen. Lay it down, brother. Lay it down." Because, you know, it can it's not just women. It's a spirit. &gt;&gt; It's a dominating female spirit. Let's be real clear about that. The Thotyan spirit. The the Leodysian church age is a culmination of all of the ages, and that was one of the ages. But that dominating female spirit, it can be in women. Oh my. It can be in men. &gt;&gt; I feel like if I was Brother Codre, I'd be going like this. It could be in men. The dominating female spirit can be in men. It can be in organizations. And you know the worst thing, brothers and sisters, is if the dominating female spirit gets into a pastor, gets into a preacher. Because when that happens, I guarantee you that church will become lukewarm, formal, and powerless. either that or a pastor is going to have some big cleanup on aisle number one after that minister leaves, right? Because words travel, spirits travel in words. Sorry. That's how spirits travel in words. And if you wonder how that works, if you talk about the meal time conversations where maybe a husband and a wife will have a conversation and say that nobody, nobody from the church is here. We can just destroy that brother from the sound booth because he should have turned that song quicker. If I was in the sound booth, I would have done it whatever and go on and on and on. And maybe that brother, I tried to correct him and he just wouldn't listen to me. He's got a defiant spirit. Maybe he's got a a thotiry and dominating female spirit in him because he can't be corrected because true sons and daughters will always be corrected, right? The chastisement of the Lord. But you know what happens is now the husband and the wife are having that conversation and there's a spirit associated with that conversation. Don't think there isn't because there is. That spirit goes back and forth and unfortunately the little ears hear it. And the troubling part is now those ears are subject to that spirit because the parents are the Holy Ghost. They're the gatekeepers to the family. And when they allow those conversations to happen when no one else is listening, &gt;&gt; it's not hurting anyone else. It's hurting their family. &gt;&gt; How is it hurting their family? Because now that child or wife or husband is going to have this opinion formed. They're going to have an opinion formed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, if we have an opinion formed and it's outside of the word of God, it's a spirit. &gt;&gt; Spirits love to just sit anchored as an opinion in our brains. &gt;&gt; Love it. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; Let it be the Holy Spirit, brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; because that Holy Spirit is going to kick out any other spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Lord, forgive us if we've ever had a conversation like that. I'm I'm so glad that I can say that. I'm not going to say it because I'd be lying if I said that. I wish I could say that. I've never had a conversation like that. I'm a human. And you know, there was a time in my life where I thought I was I was just smarter than every other human. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; And you know what? We all go through it. &gt;&gt; And Lord willing, we'll all grow out of that and recognize that we're all sinners just saved by grace. And if we have a word of wisdom in our lives, it's only because he gave it to us. &gt;&gt; We're flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; We're bags of bones and skin. THERE'S NOTHING GOOD INSIDE OF US outside of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But sometimes we get that air about ourselves. We're just smarter than everybody else. &gt;&gt; And you know what happens is people don't like hanging out with people like that. &gt;&gt; But you know, Brother Brandham says it that birds of a feather, they flock together. Many times you'll get the people that are just smarter than everyone else. They'll just hang together with everyone else. And sometimes you'll get the people that are the most religious ones, more religious than anyone else. They'll just be religious with everyone else. Who is like that, right? Birds of a feather flock together. But I want to encourage us, brothers and sisters. Let's just dress ourselves down, not in a perverted way, but in a Christian way, and allow the washing of the water of the word to come over our hearts and our minds &gt;&gt; and our souls &gt;&gt; so that the word can change us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, this woman at the well, she was taught she she wasn't ignorant. She wasn't an ignorant woman. Let's go back to John St. John chapter 4. St. John chapter 4. We're going to get to questions and answers. Not just questions, but answers, too. We're going to get there. I just felt to get into this a little bit because this woman had a question, but I think it's awesome because she didn't really come out and ask it. She didn't seek Jesus, did she? And that's the way it is, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Many times as believers, we don't seek the Lord. The Lord seeks us &gt;&gt; and I apologize. Welcome back, brother Stephen and Sister Judith. &gt;&gt; We missed you. It's good to see you again. Hope you had a wonderful time. St. John chapter 4 verse 1. When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, though Jesus himself [snorts] baptized not, but his disciples. He left Judea and departed again into Galilee. Isn't that interesting that he would just put that in the scripture there because these Pharisees must have been just in a flat because now this is all getting out of hand. Everybody's got this new doctrine of water baptism. It's amazing to see it. Verse three says, "He left Judea and departed into Galilee and he must needs go through Samaria." You can imagine that his disciples were like, "Why do you want to go through Samaria? Why do you want to do that? Because it wasn't where they really wanted to be as Jews. &gt;&gt; Verse five. Then cometh he to a city of Samaria which is called Saikar near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour. Isn't it beautiful to think that &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; We all have our lives to live. We all have our regular duties that we have to do. We have all of the things that just need to be done. And in the midst of all of that, Jesus himself, he knows where his children are. He knows when his children need to be spoken to and he will come and put himself right in our path. &gt;&gt; Himself right in our path. &gt;&gt; Just like this woman. &gt;&gt; Verse seven. No coincidence for those people who are into the sevens. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith unto her, "Give me to drink." Yes. &gt;&gt; For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat. Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou being a Jew askest, drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. No doubt they thought they were filthy people. Verse 10. Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou kneest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou would have wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. And we know what's going on here. He's actually taking some time with her. Isn't it wonderful that he's that kind of a God? Yes, &gt;&gt; he's willing to take his time with us. And sometimes it's in just a couple of words just like this. And sometimes it's in just a couple of services. And sometimes it's in just a couple of decades, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But he always puts himself in front of us and makes sure that he is a gentleman to us. &gt;&gt; The woman saith unto him, "Sir, we know we've gone over this in the past. The natural circumstances now are just everywhere. They're just all natural circumstances. The woman saith unto him, "Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep, from whence thou hast that living water. Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?" So, she knew, right? She had been taught. She had religion. Jesus answered and said unto her, "Whosoever drinkketh of this water shall thirst again." He takes her right into the natural circumstances. I agree. We're living in a natural world. And that's why I came and planted myself right in front of you &gt;&gt; because I understand your circumstances. I understand your need. There's nothing happening that I'm surprised by. Whosoever drinkkeeth of this water shall thirst again. Verse 14. But whosoever drinkketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst. But the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. And we know at one time I believe I said that that that she said this in a sarcastic fashion. Sure, give me that water. I would love to have that water. Like who's got that water? Nobody in this world has that water. Without recognizing who she really was speaking to. &gt;&gt; Jesus saith unto her, "Go call thy husband." Now he's contacted her spirit, &gt;&gt; and now he's going to speak to her spirit. He's going to speak to the innermost part of her being. And that is exactly the way Jesus is. That's exactly the way God is. That's exactly the way the Holy Ghost is. That's exactly why we come to church because he wants to contact us on a natural level. He wants us to open up our minds, our hearts, and our souls so that he can actually contact us and change us. But the beautiful part is I'm going to get to it. I always jump ahead like this is he doesn't force us. &gt;&gt; He doesn't correct us. He doesn't chastise us and shake us down. What he does is acts like a gentleman. And he loves us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He doesn't hurt us. He doesn't slap us around. He's not that kind of a husband. He's not berating. Jesus saith unto her, "Go call thy husband and come hither." The woman answered and said,"I have no husband." Can you imagine that? She's just being herself. I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, "Thou hast well said, I have no husband." Discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thou hast well said, I have no husband. For thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou hast is not thy husband, and that saidest thou truly, totally discerning her heart. But not so that he could beat her up, not so that he could condemn her, so that he could reveal who he was to her. &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. I believe this is such an example of a true Christian's testimony. Someone who has really gone on to being positionally placed in the land, who has gone on to adoption. I know there's many people here that would say, "I'm an adopted son and daughter of God." Amen. But my life just doesn't quite line up. There's just a little bit of an inongruity there. We're going to get into that later. But you know, someone who is truly adopted, they actually live the life. &gt;&gt; Period. You don't even have to ask them, "Are you a Christian?" They don't have to say, "I'm a Christian." They exude Christianity. And what is Christianity? It's not church membership. It's the literal life of Jesus Christ living out through his bride because she has accepted that word into her heart just like Mary did from the angel messenger. And we're no different in the day in which we live, brothers and sisters. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He has a program and he always conducts himself exactly according to the program. When we hear that word from a vindicated prophet in the day in which we live, he is the messenger to this age. When we take that word and say amen to that word, it causes a life to come forward inside of us. Just like Mary had a womb and naturally gave birth, we know that brother Brandham, he said it that the natural type's the spiritual, that natural birth of Jesus Christ is the spiritual birth of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's the same thing, but it's just a spiritual birth that happens. Now, I say just a spiritual birth. There's nothing greater on earth that could take place, brothers and sisters. Many people would say, "Well, the literal life of Jesus, Christ on earth was good." But what about now? That was 2,000 years ago, but what about now? What about now being the literal life of Jesus Christ happening to people? And that's literally what's happening in this world. And we know, Brother Brandham said it under the uncction of the Holy Ghost. When the church recognizes what it is, what is it? What's the church? What's the true church of the living God? What is going to cause the rapture to go forward? It's not going to be because I'm a good person. It's not going to be because I pay so many tithes. Oh, and I've got so much offering and I come and do all these things for the church. It's not going to be any of that. &gt;&gt; It's going to be because the death angels flying over the land looking for the token. &gt;&gt; Who's got the token? Only the adopted sons and daughters are going to have the token. And many many people will claim to have the token but very few will have it. &gt;&gt; But here in the story the woman said saith unto him this is verse 19. Sir I perceive I I can see something is different. Not with my eyes but with my ears and not with my eyes and my ears but with my heart. I perceive that thou art a prophet. Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. Jesus saith unto her,"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither worship in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews and we know that he met another woman I thought it was so good the other woman she came behind him and she just wanted something from him and what did she want she wanted the healing of her daughter and he said you know what it's not meat for me to cast the children's bread to dogs how many of us could tolerate something like that if we got into church And we heard Jesus say that to us. If a pastor said something, if a preacher said something that maybe just didn't tickle our ears the right way, oh my, we might just get offended and run away and go and find another church that would just tickle our ears. &gt;&gt; But here we got a a a messiah that would call a woman a dog. And she said, "Yay, Lord. Even the dogs, they get to eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table." Amen. &gt;&gt; A true son and daughter of God, they're not going to get offended. &gt;&gt; It just it shocks me when you start to hear how many people they're offended. So many people get offended. They're offended. You know what the word says that offenses must come. &gt;&gt; That's a scripture. So I I I say maybe we ought to get over it and be rugged sons and daughters of God, not house flowers, &gt;&gt; right? something that's maybe what we would call a native plant. When when all of the bugs and the temperatures and everything would happen around us, the environment would get rough, &gt;&gt; we still flourish. &gt;&gt; And you know what's beautiful, brothers and sisters? We might have a smaller flower, but it's more beautiful. &gt;&gt; We might have a smaller fruit, but it's sweeter. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you look at the hot house flowers and and fruits, great fruits, but not nearly as sweet as something that's grown naturally. But this woman here, let's go back to our scripture. Verse 22. Ye worship, ye know not what. We know what we worship. For salvation is of the Jews. And we know that Jesus was identifying himself as a Jew in that moment. We know that he was neither Jew or Gentile. To be clear, verse 23 says, "But the hour cometh, and now is." &gt;&gt; How could it be now then? Because God was manifest in flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father seeketh such to worship him, and God is his spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. Do you ever think about that verse 24 &gt;&gt; of St. John chapter 4? Just a conversation happening between Jesus, the Messiah, and and the woman at the well. Just that happening. and and and sometimes it can actually be that way. But I think let's let's maybe zoom in a little bit and and talk about it in the way that, you know, it's not just about them. Let's let's take that and make it right personal and make it about us. We need to recognize that the only way we're going to worship him is in spirit and in truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says it very clearly. Just like all the people are reveling in in in World Series game seven, &gt;&gt; six, whatever the World Series game is into overtime innings. Everybody was sitting there just saying, "Yeah, good. Go team. Someone's gonna win." Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. Those people were probably screaming. Many people probably don't even have a voice today because they wanted their team to win so bad. Brother Bradom said it very clearly that we ought to get in the spirit just as much as they do. &gt;&gt; In fact, the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and &gt;&gt; more &gt;&gt; is what he said. &gt;&gt; Don't be bashful. This is the house of the Lord. This is the place where we can let our hair down. We can let the pressure off. We can take our coats off. We can roll up our sleeves. WE CAN JUST BE OURSELVES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We've come to worship. Did you come to WORSHIP TODAY? IF WE'VE COME TO WORSHIP, WE'VE COME TO worship in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't come to worship in spirit and in truth, guess what? You are not worshiping the way that he wants to be worshiped. &gt;&gt; But you know, &gt;&gt; the only way that we can do that is to have faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And faith cometh by hearing. &gt;&gt; Hearing of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know, brothers and sisters, it's impossible to please him without faith. &gt;&gt; Verse 25 says, "The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah has cometh, which is called Christ, when he has come, when he has come, he will tell us all things." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know the rest of the story. I'm not going to go through the rest of it. I just wanted to get to that place there by reading the rest of it from verse one onwards just just to show that when when we have a question in our heart, this woman had a question in her heart. And God knew it. God knew that she would have that question in her heart that day before the foundation of the world. He knew that she would be there. He knew they would have that conversation. He knew all about it. But he also knew what she would choose. And that's what the difference between election is. Election and unelection. The people that aren't elected, he knows what choice they'll make, but he doesn't make their choice for them. And the people who are elected, he knows what choice they'll make, but he doesn't make the choice for them. He's God. He's sovereign. And what he does is allows us to be free moral agents. Now, I could bring out a quote for that, and I'm not going to do it. That's just uh for free, a sidebar. That's just the anointing of the Holy Ghost. And I think it's beautiful when that happens because he wants us to know these things. Brothers and sisters, there's no more mystery with this message of the hour. There's no more mystery with the word of God. You know, if there is, then it's just because maybe we're ignorant. Not in a bad way. We just don't know. We're not aware. He hasn't revealed it to us. And all we have to do is ask him, just reveal it to me. Because, you know, if we turn back over to Revelation, let's do that. Let's turn over to Revelation chapter 4. Let's let's go over to Revelation chapter 4. We celebrate Revelation chapter 10. Excuse me. I hope I got that mic off for that. That's terrible if I sneezed in your ear like that. Oh, [snorts] Revelation chapter 4. When we read Revelation chapter 10, to know that that mystery is is is revealed, let's take a look at the way it actually unfolded. We know that the church ages were laid out in Revelations chapter 2 and chapter 3. The last church age being the Leodysian church. But in chapter 4, John after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven. The first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me, which said, "Come up hither, and I will show thee things which much must be hereafter." So there was the invitation to John and verse two says it immediately I was in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we try and understand these things outside of the spirit, we're not going to understand them. It is going to be mysterious. It will be mysterious. There will still be mysteries outside of the spirit because we know that we could talk about the the the scroll the scrolls the seals. When when the seals are open, there was a seal on on the back side and on the front and the seal on the inside was written, but there was a seal on the backside that wasn't written. The written word that we have is the seal that was written. And the seal that wasn't written, no, I'm not taking and making a a a 14 seals doctrine, just for the record. We're not going there. Not doing that. Some people have and and we know it happens. But the seal on the back side, brothers and sisters, is the revelation of the seal on the front side. &gt;&gt; It's the revelation of that word that's been given to us freely. We know that John once he was in the spirit. What did he see? He saw in verse chapter 5 verse one says, "And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals." Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know the story full well. If you don't, I would say go read it. I'm just going to talk a little bit about it. We know that he heard the voice in heaven say, "Who is worthy to go and take the book out of him that sits on the throne?" And nobody was worthy found in heaven, under heaven, in the earth, under the earth. Nobody was worthy. And John, being a type of the bride, wept much because he recognized that his name was in that book. That was the book of redemption. But we know that he heard that voice say to him, "John, weep not. The lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's worthy &gt;&gt; to take the book &gt;&gt; and to loose the seals thereof. &gt;&gt; So when we read Revelations chapter 10, we can read verse one. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed in a cloud. I think it's so beautiful. In like manner as you see him go is what the disciples saw when Jesus was received up to heaven in a cloud. In like manner as you see him go. I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head. And I probably didn't read that in Revelation in the beginning of Revelation. The one that was sitting on the throne, he had a rainbow round about. We know that. And his feet his face as was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open. [clears throat] So when we read this word of God, when we read this message of the hour, brothers and sisters, the book is open. All seven seals are open. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The prophet says it. All seven seals are open. Some people want to take and double down on certain quotes and say that there's really only six seals open. In the seventh seal, he says he has to stop. And sure enough, he does has to stop in in in 1963 in in the preaching of that and he even goes into a hotel room and does an altered version, an edit to that tape, the last 20 minutes of the seventh seal. If you ever listen to it, you'll hear that there's an amendment to it. It wasn't the time. Brother Brandham felt really checked about it in his life. But if you just stop there, you're going to say, "Sure enough, all six seals are open." But that seventh one, he stopped. He didn't open it. And sure enough, he didn't. according to the word of God, according to what was recorded. But if you go from 1963 onwards, 1964, especially in 1964, 1965, 1964, what happens is he just shows the discernment. &gt;&gt; God standing there discerning the hearts of the people. &gt;&gt; Who can actually do that? Nobody could do that but God. &gt;&gt; Over and over and over and over without one time missing. We get a lot of people in the day in which we live which maybe have prophetic gifts and prophetic insight and maybe some of the gifts in the spirit like we were talking about and they're able to say things about people and say things and discern things and bring things. Maybe they have dreams and and and visions even they could have them because that's what the word of God says, right? We're not ignorant of that. But if they miss one time, &gt;&gt; it's wrong. &gt;&gt; The word of God says to not hear them. Unfortunately, that's what it says. I just want to say today, the revelation of God is no longer a mystery. &gt;&gt; Who God is and where he is at is no longer a mystery. And if it is, it still needs to be revealed to you. Just ask him and see if he won't reveal it. See if he won't show us exactly who we are and what we're raised up for. Because you know, Revelations 10:1-7 is kind of like the buzz message scripture. Revelations 10:7 in the days of the voice. We we know that it's in in in excuse me, even in in Jeffersonville, so much is in and around Revelation 10. And we know it's the identification of Malachi 4 5 and 6. We know that it's actually all one and the same. We're not going to confuse them. And and I'm not going to try and belittle it either. I want to just point out that there's no longer any mystery. And if we take it a little bit further, it doesn't stop at verse seven. It's most important for the day in which we live, brothers and sisters, as adopted sons and daughters of God, which is what I believe we all want to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I trust that we can all say that we are. And if not, let's ask the Lord to show us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's a little bit of work for us to do. Verse eight. And the voice, this is out of Revelation 10:8. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, John being a type of the bride, remember this, and said, "Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. Go and get that little book. Go take it out of his hand." So the book was in the hand of him that was on the throne. Then it was in the hand of the lamb. Then it was in the hand of that mighty angel that came down from heaven. Now it's going from the hand of that mighty angel right into the hand of man. &gt;&gt; Take that book. Go and get that book yourself. Go take the little book which is open, not closed, in the hand of the angel which standeth upon this upon the sea and upon the earth. And we know the sea is the people. The earth is actually the world. And I went unto the angel and said unto him, give me the little book. How many people have done that today? Amen. &gt;&gt; Gone to that angel and said, "Give to me that little book that's open. REVEAL TO ME IN MY HEART THIS mystery that I keep hearing about." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take it and eat it up. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. Verse nine says, "And I went unto the angel and said unto him, Give me the little book." And he said unto me, Take it and eat it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, &gt;&gt; but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up. And it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. We We know this scripture very well. Perhaps there's somebody here today that doesn't really understand it. &gt;&gt; It's going to increase our spirit. &gt;&gt; Actually, our spirit's going to decrease and his spirit will increase in our life when we eat this book. But if we don't eat this book, it's not going to change our bodies. &gt;&gt; Now, you don't have to be a scholar of the word of God. You don't have to memorize all the scripture. Just take it and eat it. It didn't say take the book and memorize it, John. It said take the book and eat it up. &gt;&gt; That's all we need to do. I heard an elder minister, someone asking him saying, you know, what would what would be your advice for uh young ministers in the church today? What would be your advice? And and he said two things. This is an elder minister, someone that's been around and seen it all. And what did he say? He said two things. One of them, know your Bible. And the other one, pray. &gt;&gt; And the rest of it will all fall in line. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you don't pray and you don't read your Bible, how can you preach? &gt;&gt; How can you actually go and do what the word says in verse 10? And I took the little book out of the angel's hand. I ate it up. It was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it up, it made my belly bitter. And he said unto me, thou must prophesy again before many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings. &gt;&gt; And we know that word prophesy is the same as preach. We have to be able to preach. My &gt;&gt; I just love the word of God. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Yeah, man. &gt;&gt; Aside from the scripture, I haven't even touched the notes today. This woman, she had religion, didn't she? And she believed something, which I think is so beautiful. As I was studying this, it came to me. She believed something that she didn't even know. And I just think that's exactly the life of a Christian. There's something in our heart that we believe. We just don't even know it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There's a hunger and a thirst for something. There's a hunger and thirst for more, but we just don't even know what it is. But there comes a day where we actually get to meet him face to face when we have that hunger. He will never ever leave us or forsake us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She did not know what it was that she was believing in. Because Jesus even said to them, you're worshiping in in in in a way that you don't even know. You don't even know what you're worshiping. Is it warm in here? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It feels really warm in here. When that happens, I have to wonder. I'm just going to be honest with you. I wonder if I'm actually going off and and there's sort of a spiritual battle going on or if maybe it is really warm in here. And I I just don't know. Uh sometimes I heard brother Toby say it. Sometimes we just need to jump up and shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If we're starting to get sleepy, brothers and sisters, let's just praise the Lord for a minute. Let's not tolerate it. The devil wants us to go to sleep. [applause] &gt;&gt; If we have to, we can turn the fans on and open the door. I'm not throwing off on anyone. I just feel like it's hot in here. You know, I'm serious about that. But I know what it's like to work and I know what it's like to work hard and I know what it's like to come to church and to be tired. When you've worked all week long and you come and you sit down and you start to get in the presence of the Lord and that washing of the water of the word starts to happen, it can become very soothing. When you come into a place like this, which is a place of rest, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You come out of the world of of darkness and you get into a place like this. This is the place that we desire to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not necessarily the devil that's trying to make us go to sleep. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's just natural circumstances. It's just warm in here. &gt;&gt; But praise the Lord, we're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This woman, she didn't even know what she believed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But she believed. &gt;&gt; I think it's such a beautiful thing because it's really a type of a believer in the day in which we live. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But like I said, there came a day where she came face to face. And that thing that she believed revealed itself himself directly to her. &gt;&gt; And he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And he wants to reveal himself today &gt;&gt; in the fullness of this revelation and the fullness of this mystery causing it to no longer be mysterious. But I think it's so beautiful. Don't you? Jesus didn't scold her. He never once scolded her, did he? He didn't tell her, "You're a filthy sinner. &gt;&gt; You've had five husbands and the one that you're with isn't yours either. You're a whore." He never said that, did he? But you know, many times Christian people can start to get a little bit of an air about themselves and say, "Look at that woman. She's ill- famed." I say, "Lord, help us." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you know what? Spiritually speaking, invisible union of the BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. ANYBODY THAT'S GOT ANY OTHER thought or any other worldly attraction besides the word of God, they shall be called an adulteress according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we'll just take that and put it off naturally and say, "Well, you know what? If a a woman has a living husband and she gets married again, then she shall be called an adulteress." That's not what the invisible union of the bride is talking about, brothers and sisters. He's talking about a spiritual union of the bride on earth with the heavenly bridegroom. &gt;&gt; And what happens? There's a new birth. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about that very clearly in the invisible union of the bride of Jesus Christ. But we can begin to get a little bit of an air in our lives if we're not careful. And if we do get that air in our lives, it's not his spirit. I'll tell you, we're not adopted yet. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Because there is a crossing over. I keep going back to it. I can't get away from adoption. I was talking to the deacons about it. It's just so beautiful. I I can't get away from adoption, brothers and sisters. I believe full well that's the age in which we live. The mysteries have been revealed. The seals have been open. We know all of those things and and all the signs and wonders have happened in the message and around the world. Seven times it's happened. We've got all the books and tapes. We've got all THE APPS. BUT DO WE HAVE THE LIFE? &gt;&gt; Cuz that's what's happening now. We're talking about adoption being positionally placed in the land. And if you listen to what Brother Brandham says in adoption, he says, "We're talking to mature Christians now. &gt;&gt; We're not talking to babies anymore. &gt;&gt; We're talking TO MATURE SONS AND DAUGHTERS that need to be positionally placed into their inheritance." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And boy, I got a quote that's a zinger today. I'm going to bring it later. &gt;&gt; But you know, we're talking about questions and answers. &gt;&gt; But the questions and answers are what's going to take us and positionally place us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we can get a spiritual question in our life, we can have a spiritual answer. Don't think for a second that God wants to leave us or forsake us. That he just won't tell us when we have a question in our hearts. There comes a day where we will be face to face with the question that we have in our hearts. So I want to say what's what's the question that we have in our hearts? Because if we have a question, he's got an answer and he'll give it to us. But Jesus didn't scold this woman, this ill-famed woman. She was an ill-famed woman. So the prophet called her. What did he do? He contacted her spirit. &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, help me." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To contact people's spirit. To take the time to talk to people. Many times I want to just scoot past people holding those signs. You know the ones on the side of the road. Those ones, some of them are needy and some of them aren't. Some of them are just pretending. But you know, they're out there and they're doing that. And you can tell some of them are really rough individuals. Do we look them in the eye and and pray for them or do we just look the other way and hope that quickly that light changes so we don't have to contend with them? Those are the people that need it. &gt;&gt; Preaching to myself here now. [laughter] &gt;&gt; That wasn't for you. That was for me. &gt;&gt; But you know what Jesus did? He contacted her spirit. &gt;&gt; He didn't tell her she was ill famed to get away from me, you Samaritan. It's not meat for us to to throw the children's bread to dogs. No, he never said that. This woman, she had this question in her heart. And you know, let's just bring it forward now. From then to now, we'll say now, "Brother Brown, I'm a 1960 uh 53, sorry, 1953. Questions and answers. If you type in now, if anyone's got questions and I'll let you bring it up. I didn't send it to the boys this morning. I apologize. It's not on them. It's on me." So, when you have the conversations about the sound booth, it's it's it's right here. But don't say anything too bad about the pastor. Questions and answers in 1953. Now, if anyone's got any questions that they want to hand in, why just push them right on up? Let some child bring them or whatever you want to do. Why would he say that? Just so they would be anonymous, right? Cuz you don't want to actually single people out and and say, you know, you don't want that. He says, just push them right on up. let some child bring them or whatever you want to do. Or maybe if we get through I I got about six here on one page and then over here then we got two over there. Now we want to find out. The reason we do this is to find out what's on the people's mind. We want to contact your spirit. I want to contact your spirit. Now, brother Brandon wanted to contact people's spirits. Tell us what's on your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to be able to help. tell us what's on the people's mind, what they're thinking about. See, and that's what makes a good, strong church. So, this is where my ears perk up because I want to see a good, strong church. I want to see a good praying church. I want to see a body of believers that are strong in the faith, a good, strong church. He says, you've got to have the times just like you got to comb the cuckle out. Did you ever get a cucklebur in your jacket or on on your hair even? You ever get those little burrs? Sometimes you just have to walk through something and then you've got like a hundred burrs down your legs. Sometimes you got to just comb them out. Sometimes we just walk through some traditions. Sometimes we have some ideas that are planted in our lives and you know, brother Bradom talks about it here. You just need to comb them out. That's all. We just need to comb out the cuckle birds, you know, and and everything and get all the things out of the way so that you can move steadily. Because remember, brothers and sisters, we're talking about adoption. That is my theme, I think, in terms of ministry. I can't get away from it. I know we're in a one room schoolhouse. Some people don't even have uh have never taken water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ. Some people have done that and they've never actually been able to identify that they truly have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their life. That's that's the reality of where we're at. I understand that fully. But we're not actually preaching and stopping there. Where we're stopping is rapture. &gt;&gt; Because once we make it in the rapture, our job's over. &gt;&gt; We just want to see people get in the rapture. That's where it's at. &gt;&gt; You know, there's people that are going to go into the tribulation. I don't want to preach people into the tribulation. Why would I do that? Why would any minister want to do that? &gt;&gt; We want to preach people into the rapture. And the thing that's going to do that is for them to recognize who they are. &gt;&gt; And I'm so very, very, very thankful the more that I think about it that I was introduced to this message through a pastor that preached the truth for our day. &gt;&gt; That he preached adoption. He preached being positionally placed. I t talked about a little while ago, you know, on July 27th, 2005 was my very first service ever hearing that, you know, there was a a a prophet being preached about and and so on and so forth. But, you know, Brother Ken didn't even really preach too much about the prophet. But in that service is where I got converted. That's where I actually got in in love with Jesus Christ again in my life because I was like the woman at the well. I was a spiritual adulterer. I I truly was completely out there. But he came and he positionally placed himself right in my pathway. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm a living witness of it the same way. Brothers and sisters, he doesn't change his ways. He's as immutable in his nature as he is in his ways. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So for people to maybe think that I just don't know whether I've got the Holy Ghost. I want to tell you, ask him and he will show you. &gt;&gt; It's not a mystery. &gt;&gt; That's why his prophets SAID IT'S LIKE HAVING A BABY. If you have a baby, you don't forget that you had a baby. And anybody that's ever experienced what it's like to see a birth coming forth, let alone feeling what it means to have a baby, you can't forget that. &gt;&gt; It's awfully quiet. &gt;&gt; But it's true. &gt;&gt; So if you have a question, he's got an answer. If there's a question about whether I'm saved, he's going to answer it. He'll tell you how you know that you're saved. If we've got a question on whether I'm on the right track with his word, he will give us an answer to show us that we're on the right track with his word. If he's we got a question in our marriage, he'll show us. If we've got a question in how we're rearing our children, he'll show us. He's not going to leave us and and and leave us in a abandoned state where we're questioning, wondering what's going on. But what I wanted to say was that service, I actually found it on the computer years ago and I thought, you know, one day I'm going to go back and listen to it. and I never did. I just burned it on a CD and took it home and I cleaning stuff up the other day. I came across it and I thought, man, I want to listen to this. And I don't know, it just did something for me. And uh so I asked brother Josh if he would take it and just save it on the computer here. So if anybody's interested, we could share the link and you'll probably listen to it and think, I don't even know what happened there. [laughter] But it was my appointed time. That's all I can say. &gt;&gt; God used brother Ken to speak to me. God used brother Ken to discern my heart at the well. &gt;&gt; And I just think it's so beautiful because I had a question. Is there a God? And if there is a God, where is the God? How could I ever find that guy? I would just love to know where that God is. But I have no idea where because I can see the false over here and I can see the false over there and everything in between. And I'm not interested in finding the false. I want to do it right. If I'm ever going to do it, I want to do it right. Isn't it wonderful how he answers his questions? I'm not saying that I'm anything. I'm saying that he's everything. And when I actually had that question, he brought me to it. It took me years. It took me years, but I got there. He took me and actually showed me. &gt;&gt; Brother Brad, I'm going on this quote here. He says, "So now, now that's the reason we have question night once in a while is to find out." And it's so beautiful. We have these question nights. They're actually documented for anybody that wants it. It's called Cood. It's on the church app or the the sorry, the the &gt;&gt; table the table app. If you go into the volumes section and you look it up, there's adoption is at the top of it, by the way. I don't think that's any accident that it's called adoption. A it's a great series. &gt;&gt; Adoption number one through four. But that's not what I wanted to point out. The one that I wanted to point out is the volume of questions and answers. And uh there's a whole bunch of questions and answers. And if you don't read, if you can't read, if you just are busy and you can only listen, you can listen to how brother Brandham actually answers. And the voice inflection and the discernment is so wonderful. But if you could ever just listen and then read at the same time, there is volumes of books called COD, conduct, order, and doctrine they're called. And uh it's just questions and answers. people asking questions, looking for answers. And this is brother Brandham setting the church back in order. This is the Holy Ghost setting the church back in order just like Paul in the first church age. Brother Bradam says, "So now that's the question. We have question night once in a while. Now if there's any questions now this time I kind of opened it up way wide and I say now used to be I'd say now if anybody just anything pertaining to scripture answer ask it says thank you brother and I said just anything pertaining to a scripture answer see and we would answer it and and that's my desire brothers and sisters for this local church or even people maybe who are sort of associated with the local church if you got a question, bring it forward. If you associate with us, by all means, bring it forward and and let's see what the Lord will do. Now, I hope we don't get a whole bunch of online questions. I just want to say this to the brothers. I don't monitor the the YouTube feed, so if if if questions do come up, if you could forward them to me, that would be tremendous. I would just hate for them to linger there. &gt;&gt; But the first question that was brought up, and uh is it really 10 to 12 already? Is that right? We sure that it's not 10 to 11 cuz I haven't even gotten into the question yet. &gt;&gt; You know, it's just setting. Yeah, maybe it's a new clock. It's just a little fast. It's about 40 45 minutes fast. &gt;&gt; 49 minutes fast. &gt;&gt; I don't even know if I can do this justice at this point. My &gt;&gt; can we stay till two &gt;&gt; or one &gt;&gt; ignore the clock &gt;&gt; you know yeah I will &gt;&gt; I just want to be respectful you know people have commitments and I don't know I just love the inspiration of the spirit maybe a little too much I guess um it's a question that came forward I don't know who wrote it and I don't want to and uh I I think that it should be that way we don't want to know who has written the question. We just want to know that the question's on someone's heart. So the question is, can girls shave? Can girls shave? And it says, this is part of the question. Can girls shave? I cannot find anything about that in the message. So I want to say this, there actually is an answer directly about that in the message. And if whoever wrote this either looked on conduct, order, and doctrine, questions and answers, or just typed it in as a table app search, it would come up with the answer. But this took me in a direction that I think is really good. And I maybe I'll just set the background for it and and not keep us too long. But, you know, I think there's there's a scriptural question. There's got to be a scriptural answer, right? And uh we know that there was a time in in the Levitical priesthood where people shaved their heads and that was typically when they were either in mourning or when they actually had leprosy. They would have to shave their bodies entirely if they had leprosy. But the question that we have here in our local church is can girls shave? I cannot find anything about that in the message. So maybe I'll jump to the quote. I I kind of put it as the the last thing because I wanted to go into uh uh bear with me for a second here. There it is. So, this is in questions and answers in 1964. Questions and answers number four 0830. Brother Brham, is it wrong for a woman to shave her legs? So, this is a question that's being asked directly to the prophet. This isn't the question that's local to here, but I just have to bring it together and say it's about shaving. Now, does a woman shave whatever? I don't know. I'm not interested. The fact is, some people might shave their face. Some people might shave their legs. I don't know and it doesn't matter. But listen to what brother Brandham says about shaving for a woman. Brother [snorts] Brandham, is it wrong for a woman to shave her legs? This is what brother Brandham says. Am I seeing things? [laughter] He talks about it. It's it's mentioned here. Am I seeing things? Is this right? Does that say that? He says, I can't. He says, I don't know. I'm going to leave that with you. Isn't that beautiful? Now, I want to say this because it's important. I don't want to actually make humor or light of the legitimate question that came. And if it's somebody just messing around to try and mess with me, it's okay. I'm okay with that, too. I believe me, I think about all of the different things and and I trust that nobody would do that. I would trust that it would be a genuine, honest question. &gt;&gt; And I want to bring a genuine honest answer. Right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham didn't say that it was wrong. &gt;&gt; So if it's something that you do, okay, I'm not going to say one way or the other. I I just think it takes me right back to the way my pastor taught me where I'm not going to tell you. [laughter] Why would he say that? He wouldn't come right out and say it. And I'm so thankful that he wouldn't come right out and say it that way, &gt;&gt; but he would say, "You know what? God needs to reveal that to you. &gt;&gt; And if we ask him, he'll show you. &gt;&gt; And I believe if God's prophet saw something wrong with that, do you not think that he would have said, "Nope. &gt;&gt; Don't you dare do that." &gt;&gt; And this is where I haven't even started to really answer this question the way that I wanted to. Let's just do this for the sake of discussion because I really don't want to keep everyone here. But uh where is it? Bear with me. Okay. Can girls shave? I cannot find anything about that in the message. Brother Bradom, first he was shocked to see it. Then he said, "Is this real?" Then he said, "I'm going to leave that to you." If it was wrong, he would have said, "Don't do it." &gt;&gt; And we'll give you an example for that. Let's turn over to First Corinthians. First Corinthians, chapter 11. All you veterans out there, you know exactly where I'm going right now. 1 Corinthians chapter 11. And we'll probably have a part two on this uh just because I want to be respectful. But we'll see what the Lord will do here. 1 Corinthians chap 11. Be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ. Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you. Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; If we ever wonder, I wanted to get into it and uh I think I will. We'll we'll do it. Verse three. But I would have you to know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of every woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God. Every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonorth his head. And that's this is exactly why brothers and sisters if somebody comes into the congregation wearing a hat who is a man we're going to say please remove that because really you are actually dishonoring God by wearing a covering on your head when you come into the presence of God if you're praying. Some people aren't praying and you know maybe it just is the way it is for them. But every man, verse four, every man praying or prophesying, having his head coverth, dishonorth his head. So what's his head? &gt;&gt; Christ. &gt;&gt; He's dishonoring Christ by doing that. And you know what? We can put any excuse behind that if we want to. It's not going to be relevant. He's going to say, "My word said that you don't." Verse 5 says, "But every woman that prayth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonereth her head, for that is even all one as if she were shaven." For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn. So that that speaks specifically to if a woman's going to cut her hair, she has hair, but if she's going to cut her head, the word says that it would be better if she actually had her head shaved. But if she be if it sorry, but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered, let her have her hair. For a man indeed ought not to cover his head. For as much as he is the image and glory of God, &gt;&gt; but the woman is the glory of the man. &gt;&gt; That to me is just wow. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord for a wife that can be the glory of the man. &gt;&gt; Because really, [laughter] men aren't nothing to look at, are they? My when we get the man that says, "I'm pretty good to look at." There's something wrong there. Maybe his head's covered. Verse eight says, "For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man. Neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man. The woman was created for the man. For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels. Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man in the Lord. For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman, but all things of God. So this verse 12, I believe, could be uh a sermon all to itself because the woman is of the man. She was taken out of his side, right? So that she could be his bride. That's why she was taken out of his he took a rib was the very first surgery that happened. It was the very first marriage that took place. The woman was of the man, but the man also by the woman born in sin, shaped in iniquity, &gt;&gt; come into the world, speaking lies. The man is of the woman. The man comes through this earth through the woman. &gt;&gt; But isn't it wonderful? All things, all things of God. I just got into this a little bit and I started looking at, you know, in verse five, every woman that prayth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonorth her head, for that is even all for her head. For that is even all one as if she were shaven. And we know that that is what would actually save her in her praying or prophesying. anyone that that do it publicly. So I got into this and I started looking at this. What what is it that if she does it's actually incorrect? Every woman that prayth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonereth her head. Now I said that publicly but uh I think it's interesting as I was studying this here. Oh my, I mix myself up sometimes. It happens so easy. I got into the Amplified Bible with this. Uh, bear with me for a second. It's verse five. Now, I'm sorry, but I have to do this. In in the Amplified Bible, it says, "And any woman," this is verse 5, "any who publicly prays or prophesies, teaches, refutes, reproves, reproves, sorry, admonishes, or comforts when she is bareheaded, dishonors her head, her husband." It is the same as if her head were shaved. it it's the same as if she didn't even have a head is what the word is saying with that. But looking at this discussion about is it okay for someone to shave, I trust with all my heart that we're not talking about a woman shaving her head because the hair of the woman is the glory of the woman which is the glory of the man. And to shave one's head is a sign of something. And and I would say that it's it's a pretty significant sign. And I'm not going to go too far down that road, but I I just wanted to talk about these two things in verse 5. Prayeth or prophesieth. Going into the the Greek lexicon and G3 G4336. The word prayeth is to pray to God, to supplicate, to worship, pray earnestly, or make prayer or prophesieth is G4395 to foretell events divine, speak under inspiration, exercise the prophetic office or prophesy. And and some might say that's pretty crazy. But I'll tell you what, even in and around the message of the hour, I have heard of many, not just a couple, but a few women who fit this description. They like to foretell events divine. They speak under inspiration and exercise a prophetic office. Now, this is what the word says. A woman that does that, that cuts her hair, dishonereth her head. &gt;&gt; And and what's that going to do? do that's going to embarrass her husband. And if she doesn't have a husband, what's that going to do? It's going to embarrass her dad. And if she doesn't have a husband or a dad, what's that going to do? It's going to embarrass &gt;&gt; Christ. &gt;&gt; I think it's wonderful how, brother Brandham, he says this, you know, it it it just I'm going to leave it with you. Let the Holy Ghost reveal it. &gt;&gt; Let let him, the person of Jesus Christ, come into your life and reveal it to you. So, whoever had that question today, don't worry. The prophet never spoke out against it. And if it was wrong, I guarantee you he would have said, "No, don't do it." &gt;&gt; But what he did talk about very very in-depth and and I'll probably not get too far into it. Next time I'm going to pick it up. We're going to talk about this because I am going to get into the Thotyan spirit and and their hand in a glove. Where's Christopher? Their hand in a glove. For those people that missed the service on Friday, that was a pretty powerful little service from a pretty powerful little fella. &gt;&gt; We actually put the stool here so he could stand on it. And he preached a sermon about a hand to a glove and how a glove is basically nothing without a hand to fit inside it. But when it fits inside it, oh boy, I could preach it, brother, but I'm not going to. But he talked about it and that's what it is. When a woman dishonors her head by cutting her hair, what's she saying? She's saying, "I don't need leadership. &gt;&gt; I don't need leadership. I can dishonor my head." &gt;&gt; But you know what she's going to say in the world is, "I don't have to dishonor my head by cutting my hair. I'm not doing that. I still love Jesus Christ. If you loved him, you would keep his commandments." That's what he said. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you love me, keep my commandments. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know, many people are really close to them with their lips, but they're miles and miles away with their heart. &gt;&gt; It's because the knowledge hasn't made it all the way down that longest journey that has to happen right down into the heart. And like we're talking about, brothers and sisters, there's only one thing that that that's going to change our bodies in the day in which we live. And and that is the faith of Jesus Christ living out through us. And the only way that's going to happen is to humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord. How is that going to happen? Is to just say, "Be it unto me according to thy word, according to thy messenger." Because that's the way he chose to do things. You know, some would say that brother Brandham was really hard on women about cutting hair. He would people would say that brother Brandham was really hard about women wearing a garment that pertained to a man. That's what that's what people will say. But you know, let's just be clear, brothers and sisters. It's not brother Brandham that said that. &gt;&gt; Alls he did is what prophets do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Prophets only say what's already been said. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; If you want to say it, who humanly said it first? Paul said it first. But yet somehow someway we can just take out the the words of Paul to suit our life and say, "Well, this is our tradition. This is the way we've done it." I mean, I grew up with that. I grew up with that with shorts and bikinis and all of it in the world. I I never wore a bikini for the record. Strike that from the record. But it was normal for women to wear slacks and pants. It was normal for women to have short hair, permed hair. It was just normal for that to be. Women could wear garments that pertain to a man. And and you know, I think it's so important for us to re recognize that this wasn't some some some crazy doctrine that William Brham brought. All he did was point back to the scripture &gt;&gt; and said, you know what? We got to let the scripture be our absolute. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I think it's so beautiful because when the ministerial association decided they were going to challenge God's prophet about this about the word of God on water baptism and they set a trap for him, but the spirit of God came around and told them a couple days before the day before, you know what? You're trying to set a trap and it ain't going to work. You're going to lose your deposit. The building that you had rented isn't going to work out. And we know they got all upset because he started to discern their heart, the spirit of God and the prophet. But what he said to them when he got on stage there for that meeting, he told them, "I challenge any one of you that wants to challenge me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ about water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Get your Bible, put it under your arm, and come and stand on the platform right beside me and let's talk about it." &gt;&gt; And I heard it said recently, and I just think, man, amen. And I believe that with all my heart that you know what? The reason men didn't come up there was the spirits inside of them recognized they would probably fall dead at the presence of the angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because God will not be mocked. &gt;&gt; God won't be mocked. &gt;&gt; This wasn't some crazy doctrine that some crazy crank from the back woods of Kentucky brought to the world. THIS WAS WHAT PAUL PREACHED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And you know, just for the sake of it, I'm going to clench the nail here, brothers and sisters, and then I'll call the musicians. I'm going to clench the nail here. Deuteronomy chapter 22:5. Deuteronomy 22:5. Brother Brham was hard on women about cutting hair, &gt;&gt; which we read out of 1 Corinthians chapter 11. We know Paul was setting the Corinthian church in order. He was the pattern that all of the other church ages were to follow after. He was the pioneer, so to speak, for the gentile church. But you know, in Deuteronomy chapter 22, alls that Paul did was say what what excuse me, God said to his prophet Moses. He didn't bring a new doctrine. What he said was out of Deuteronomy chapter 22, excuse me, verse 5, the woman shall not wear that which pertainth unto a man. And we hear that all the time, but I think it's important to actually read the whole verse. Don't you? Especially in the day in which we live. &gt;&gt; The woman shall not wear that which pertainth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment, for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if the Lord isn't your God, then I guess it's not an abomination, is it? &gt;&gt; Now, I think it's important to say this. Really important to say this. Deuteronomy 22:5, there's a word in there, for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God. Let's go over to Leviticus. Leviticus chapter 20. I'm sorry we're going a little bit longer, but I just I felt like I had to go here and I didn't get too much push back about it. Leviticus 20:3, especially in the day in which we live, if a man lie also lie with mankind, as he lith with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, in the day in which we live, this doesn't really apply because people aren't going to be put to death for some countries maybe they will be. And maybe some people out there will try and do that. But, you know, back in this day, it was the law and they lived according to this law. So, as I read these words, I want you to understand full well that brother Barry isn't saying that we need to go and put people to death because that's not up to us to do. Some people believe that we need to get so fanatical about Christianity that we're going to have to go and put people to DEATH AND EVEN BELIEVE THAT WE'RE SERVING GOD DOING IT. That's the influence of an evil spirit. &gt;&gt; What we're talking about here is a spiritual death. &gt;&gt; The day in which we live, those people that conduct themselves in this unorderly fashion, I'll say they're committing exactly what the word says, abomination before God. and they're going to actually perish. &gt;&gt; But you know, they have the opportunity to repent just like anybody else does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What would HAPPEN IF SOMEBODY LIVED that life and came into the framework of the Christian church here, Calvary Living Word? Would we be able to say, "WELCOME, BROTHER. GET WASHED BY the water of the word." Or would we say, "OH, LOOK AT THAT." because they are looking for the exact same grace that we are thriving on. &gt;&gt; It's not different grace. &gt;&gt; But this this word I want to talk about abomination. I heard brother Aaron McGiri say it the first time and it's just resonated with me and I've gone over it and over it and over it and it just means so much. If you ever have anybody saying anything to you about this, you can remind them of what the lexicon says. H8441 abomination in the word of God. It says properly something disgusting morally that is as noun an abborance especially idolatry or concretely an idol abominal custom thing abomination. It's exactly the same word for someone that wears a garment that pertains to a man or if a mankind or a woman kind lays with the same kind. It's the same word. But we have so many times people in Christianity, Christianity would say, good Christian people would say THIS IS A CULT. WHAT YOU'RE FOLLOWING IS IS WHAT YOU'RE FOLLOWING IS ABOMINATION. But it ain't. the commandment of God through his servant, the prophets. &gt;&gt; We know that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished. Where's that mystery going to be hit? Brothers and sisters, this is one of the greatest revelations that came through the ministry of William, Mary, and Brandham is that there isn't going to be something new added to the word to open those seals. It's already in the word. It just takes the revelation by THE SPIRIT TO REVEAL IT to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if anybody wonders why we don't cut our hair, because the word says so, &gt;&gt; not because Brandham said so. &gt;&gt; If anybody wonders why the women, they wear skirts all the time. They don't wear garments that pertain to a man. If anybody wonders why men don't wear dresses that pertain TO A WOMAN, BECAUSE THE WORD SAYS SO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's not because any man said so. &gt;&gt; God said so first. Paul said so second. &gt;&gt; Brandom said so third. And I could say, hey, we say so fourth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; WE JUST BELIEVE WHAT [screaming] PAUL PREACHED. THAT'S ALL. [applause] &gt;&gt; So to summarize this question ever who it was, just like brother Brandham would say, you know, it's up to you. Just ask the Lord. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But the prophet didn't come out and say it's wrong for a woman to shave. So God bless you. go on your way. I would say just remain exactly the way you are. [laughter] Don't try and be something one way or something the other way. Just don't wear a garment that pertains to a man and don't do the other thing and I think we'll be okay. Most of all, GET THE HOLY GHOST AND LET HIM REVEAL IT TO you &gt;&gt; and we'll all be good. I'll call the musicians. Sorry we went a little bit long today. I just think it's such encouragement to know that once upon a time I had a a Christian fellow have us over for dinner, my wife and I, and him and his wife were very involved in their church and they're wonderful people. But he actually singled out my wife after supper, after dessert, when everyone was happy and relaxed. And he said, "So, what is it about the skirts? What is it about the hair? Why is it that you do that? And and you're Christians, but yet we're Christians and my wife wears jeans." &gt;&gt; He really tried to nail it down. And I felt like he was actually attacking my wife. And unfortunately, I got a little bit in the flesh. But too bad for him. I actually had already heard this from brother Aaron. And I believe it was from the Lord because it gave me such a courage to simply say, "Listen, man. It is exactly the same word. Do you believe in homosexuality?" No. Why certainly not? Well, shockingly, it's exactly the same word that's used in God's eyes. The one that commits that act in God's eyes is doing the same thing by wearing garments that pertain to a man. Now, I'm not saying this. The word is saying this. &gt;&gt; How can WE REFUTE THAT THE WORD SAYS THIS? &gt;&gt; I'll tell you how. &gt;&gt; Start getting into different versions of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Just get into different versions of the Bible. I really started to study this recently and you know it's shocking to me. You take the NIV. &gt;&gt; There's verses that are just missing. Just like an elevator will go the first floor all the way up to the 10th floor, the 11th floor, the 12th floor, then it's the 14th floor and the 15th floor. Where'd the 13th go? How could you just skip a floor? &gt;&gt; They do it in the NIV Bible. They just skip verses. I'm not going to try and go into them right now. I will eventually. If you want to do a quick search, just go and ask chat GPT, give me a detailed summary of the difference between the NIV Bible and the King James Version Bible, and you'll be surprised to see, but some of the verses are actually key verses, &gt;&gt; very important verses. And people will say, scholars will say, well, you know, it it actually is just duplicate uh uh translation. And and the reason why we've taken it out is because it just says it twice. And it doesn't need to say it twice. The verse before and the verse after they just pick it up. Why would God give his prophet that little book that was open, the King James version, to actually give to the people? Why would he do that? I guess first you have to believe that God uses prophets. But, you know, the actual translations have a lot to do with it. I was looking at one recently from Brother Jeff. He was in Arizona and he gave me a copy. I actually paid for it, but I got a copy of the I think it's the 1611 Bible. And and I was talking to brother John Panicker about this. When you look at where the Old Testament ends, maybe other Bibles say this, I haven't seen it. Where the Old Testament ends and the New Testament begins. the Old Testament, Malachi, right below Malachi on the page, it says the end of the prophets. &gt;&gt; I was surprised to see that because that's exactly where a lot of people lie. They say there's no such thing as prophets. Now, &gt;&gt; maybe there's a gift of prophecy in the church, but there's no major prophets. But yet, it's interesting because Malachi 4:5 and 6, what does it say there? &gt;&gt; Behold, I send who? YOU, ELIJAH, THE prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, there's still one more prophet. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad today that you know &gt;&gt; that you know what you know? &gt;&gt; And if you don't know, if you have a mystery, I trust that God will reveal it to you. Maybe stand with me as we close today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Gracious heavenly father, we're so thankful, Lord, for the word that you have handed down through the ages, Lord. [music] That ancient word, Father. It's it's been given to change our bodies, Lord. And Father, we know that it's not just to give us a body change, and that will create a character change. It's the other way around. It's given to create a character change. Oh, Father, to change our characters into your very image. That's the way you created man. Help us, Lord Jesus, to take the book and eat it up and to change our character to be after yours, Lord Jesus. Because once our characters all come in line with yours, oh, then you're going to take your bride home. We which are alive and remain will not hinder those who sleep. Oh, Father, we long to see those who have fallen before us, Lord, who sleep in the dust of the earth. We know they're in paradise waiting. They're never been more alive, Father. But Lord, we long for them. And Lord Jesus, we pray that you would just allow this word that was spoken today to resonate in our hearts, Lord. That we would consider these thoughts, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, that if we have a question in our heart, that we would be able to have courage enough to ask you to answer it &gt;&gt; in our church, Lord. Not in a vague way, but in a very specific fashion, that we could just have peace in our heart, Lord. If the devil troubles us and makes us feel like we're doing something wrong or out of order, maybe it's not and it's just the devil. Father, I thank you for whoever wrote that question. I pray that you would bless their heart, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Father, if there's any other questions, I pray that you would just allow them to be manifest as we read about, Lord, if we have to get a little child to bring them up, Lord, so nobody knows who it's from, let it be so. Father, I pray that you would just keep your hand upon us now as we go our separate ways. That Lord, we would esteem you greater than our our thoughts and than our ideas. And oh, Father, we know that the children of Israel in the in Gan, they esteemed the token greater than all of their thoughts and all of their traditions because they knew the death angel was coming. And how did they know? It's because your prophet told them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for letting us know that we can take the token, too. We can take the token and apply it in our lives. &gt;&gt; Father, I pray that you would just keep your hand upon each one of us. Lord, be with those who are traveling. Lord, those who are away, maybe some sick in their bodies, maybe some are just traveling, visiting, wherever they are. Father, we just thank you for them and we pray that you would bless them abundantly. as we go our separate ways. Father, just receive some worship now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we sing that song? Word of God ever true.
