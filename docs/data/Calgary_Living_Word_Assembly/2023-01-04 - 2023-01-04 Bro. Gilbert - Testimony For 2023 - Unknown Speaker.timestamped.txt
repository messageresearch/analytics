[32:53] [Music]
[33:15] let's repeat that stanza your plans are
[33:17] perfect
[33:19] [Music]
[33:27] oh sometimes
[33:29] [Music]
[33:57] I will follow
[34:00] [Music]

[34:25] God bless you thank you musicians thank
[34:27] you
[34:48] God bless you Saints
[34:50] Happy New Year
[34:53] I feel a little bit nervous
[34:57] for taking the first service of the year
[35:03] I prefer the pastor taking the first
[35:06] service for the year so that at least he
[35:08] gives Direction
[35:10] for the other ministers to follow
[35:13] but now
[35:15] here it has fallen my Lord I don't know
[35:17] which side to go
[35:19] but I'm just trusting that uh God will
[35:23] come down and say something that will
[35:25] help you
[35:30] uh
[35:33] I was thinking now what what where do I
[35:36] go
[35:38] then I remembered people on 31st they
[35:43] gave testimonies
[35:44] and we enjoyed them
[35:46] so I'm also going to give now my
[35:49] testimony
[35:52] but if you feel comfortable and say that
[35:54] will be too personal
[35:56] then you can give it a different title
[35:59] because the Pastor said God's calls the
[36:04] said call for the year 2023.
[36:07] so God has set a call for 2023 so you
[36:12] can make that one to be your your
[36:13] subject but me I'll call it my personal
[36:16] testimony
[36:21] so I but uh I've borrowed
[36:27] from the subject we covered in late
[36:29] preach
[36:30] which we called God's covenant
[36:37] so for those who are Inlet preach please
[36:40] don't switch off and say with your
[36:42] right-handed please remember the
[36:45] inspiration is the same but the
[36:47] anointing is different
[36:49] foreign
[36:56] encourage me
[36:58] to preach
[37:00] so that at least we can see what God has
[37:04] for us this fast service of 2023
[37:08] let's turn to our bypass Hebrews chapter
[37:10] 8.
[37:23] Hebrews chapter 8.
[37:33] amen
[37:38] good
[37:41] all the time
[37:44] okay from verse 8
[37:49] for finding fold with them he sayeth
[37:52] behold the days come says the Lord when
[37:55] I will make a New Covenant with the
[37:58] house of Israel and with the house of
[38:00] Judah not according to the Covenant that
[38:04] I met with their fathers in the day when
[38:07] I took them by the hand to lead them out
[38:09] of the land of Egypt because they
[38:12] continued not in my Covenant
[38:14] and I recorded them not says the Lord
[38:17] for this is the Covenant that I will
[38:20] make with the house of Israel after
[38:23] those days says the Lord
[38:25] I'll put my laws into their mind and
[38:28] write them in their hearts and I will be
[38:31] to them a God and they shall be to me a
[38:34] people
[38:35] and they shall not teach every man his
[38:38] neighbor and every man his brother
[38:40] saying know the Lord For All Shall know
[38:43] me from the least to the greatest for
[38:47] I'll be merciful to their
[38:49] unrighteousness and their sins and their
[38:52] iniquities will I remember no more
[38:55] in in that he saith a New Covenant he
[38:59] has met the first old now that which
[39:03] decayeth waxes old is ready to vanish
[39:07] away let us pray
[39:10] our most gracious father
[39:13] we call upon thy name
[39:16] because you told us to call and you will
[39:19] answer
[39:20] and you are not a man that you can lie
[39:23] your what is true your promises are yeah
[39:27] and amen so we believe as we call upon
[39:30] thee you are going to answer at the
[39:33] cries of our souls this after this
[39:35] evening Lord we want to commit the
[39:37] service in your hands father Lord Jesus
[39:40] we have seen you on many occasions we
[39:43] have called upon thee and you have
[39:45] always you have never failed us father
[39:47] you have always come down to speak to
[39:49] our hearts Lord Jesus even as our
[39:52] brother prayed earlier on May you do
[39:54] something as you did to those who came
[39:56] from a mouse when you opened their eyes
[39:59] and they knew you father Lord may you
[40:02] break the Word of Life unto us this
[40:04] evening so that we can know you better
[40:06] than we have known you before father I
[40:08] commit myself now in your hands just
[40:10] take hold of me Father take me take me
[40:13] away Lord Jesus so that you come down
[40:16] and speak to your children father there
[40:18] is nothing I can offer them Lord but you
[40:21] have something for them so Lord Jesus
[40:23] grass as they come hunkering and fasting
[40:26] to hear from you master may you honor
[40:29] the cries of their souls so that you
[40:31] speak to them Father bless the reading
[40:33] of the word as we commit it now in your
[40:35] hands for it's in Jesus Christ's name we
[40:37] pray
[40:38] you can take your seats sorry for
[40:40] keeping you standing
[40:48] okay
[40:51] what is a covenant
[40:55] a covenant is an agreement entered into
[41:01] by two or more parties
[41:05] and you cannot just enter into a
[41:07] covenant for nothing there must be
[41:09] something you want to achieve
[41:12] so when God enters into a covenant with
[41:15] man there must be something that he
[41:17] wants to achieve
[41:22] now
[41:25] people make different Covenants
[41:30] we have marriage covenant
[41:34] you can put in any other Covenant that
[41:37] you know of
[41:38] we don't have time to go into details
[41:42] but people make different Covenants
[41:45] and the prophet says in the orient times
[41:49] how they used to make a Covenants in the
[41:53] message Israel in Egypt but the Oriental
[41:56] custom was to kill a beast and stand in
[42:00] between this beast and then write out
[42:02] over here you find it in Leviticus and
[42:06] they write out their agreement
[42:10] and that agreement is stored into two
[42:12] over this dead beast and they take an
[42:16] oath over the dead Beast that if they
[42:19] break this Covenant May their body be as
[42:22] this dead beast and they give each one a
[42:26] piece and they send them away
[42:30] you can imagine
[42:32] you kill an animal
[42:34] you stand on this side and your partner
[42:37] stands on the other side and as you look
[42:39] at the dead animal you say if you fail
[42:43] to honor This Promise may you die the
[42:46] way this animal is dead
[42:48] and because people fear death
[42:52] people will honor that argument
[42:57] but
[43:00] we have advanced so much
[43:02] until nowadays we will sign
[43:06] but because you don't want to honor the
[43:09] agreement you say can you prove that
[43:12] actually this signature is mine
[43:16] why you don't want to fulfill the
[43:18] agreement
[43:20] but God is faithful
[43:22] when he makes an agreement he fulfills
[43:25] his part
[43:29] amen
[43:30] now
[43:33] we've had different Covenants
[43:37] there was adamic Covenant
[43:40] there was Noah's Covenant
[43:43] there was abrahamic Covenant
[43:47] now
[43:48] the prophet says adamic Covenant it
[43:52] failed
[43:53] why because
[43:56] God made an argument with man
[44:00] and any time God makes an agreement with
[44:03] man man will always fail his part
[44:09] I can prove it
[44:12] how many times have you met ackermans or
[44:15] covenants with God that I'll be being
[44:17] the first person to come to church and
[44:19] you find yourself the last person
[44:23] you've already broken the agreement
[44:26] oh this year I will do this you find
[44:30] yourself doing the opposite
[44:32] which means as long as you remain a man
[44:35] or a woman there is no way you are going
[44:39] to fulfill God's covenant
[44:41] you will always fail
[44:45] so
[44:48] in conclusion we can say
[44:51] for God to make an agreement
[44:54] that will be binding it has to be it has
[44:57] to be God making a covenant with God
[45:02] remember we are following my testimony
[45:07] so in a nutshell I'm saying for me to
[45:11] make a covenant with God I must become
[45:13] God
[45:18] anything short of that there is no way
[45:20] you are going to fulfill you are part of
[45:23] the agreement
[45:28] may God help us
[45:31] oh my
[45:33] now
[45:41] in the message called Covenant with
[45:43] Abraham paragraph E7 and I want you to
[45:47] notice that God said in here
[45:49] I will now when God as we were speaking
[45:53] last evening he met a covenant I joined
[45:56] Covenant with the children but with a
[45:59] fast fast parent the hidden Covenant it
[46:03] was conditional Covenant God when he
[46:07] spoke to Adam and the Blessed Adam he
[46:10] made a covenant between he and Adam if
[46:14] Adam would do a certain thing he would
[46:16] do a certain thing and then we find out
[46:19] that Adam broke his part of the promise
[46:25] so if you are going to remain a human
[46:28] being
[46:29] there is no way you are going to fulfill
[46:32] your part of the Covenant
[46:36] but God wants to make a covenant
[46:39] as we shall see may God help us
[46:43] are we following
[46:45] okay
[46:47] amen now when it came to Noah
[46:52] Noah's Covenant it also fails that is
[46:54] the prophet who says that
[46:57] so the prophet says Noah's Covenant Noah
[47:02] failed
[47:04] and that's why the scripture where we
[47:06] read the Bible says a new covenant
[47:11] why because the only one it failed but
[47:15] God doesn't want to fail
[47:17] so he had to make another Covenant and
[47:21] that's why he came now with abrahamic
[47:25] Covenant
[47:26] now how did abrahamic covenant not fail
[47:31] God had to take part of his name and
[47:35] joined it to Abram to make it Abraham
[47:39] so that now when he's making a covenant
[47:43] he's not making a covenant with Abram as
[47:46] a man he's making a covenant with God
[47:49] himself
[47:57] I love it
[47:59] laughs
[48:01] so that was Abraham
[48:05] that God had to take part of his name
[48:08] and join it to apram to make it Abraham
[48:14] so by that now he's not making a
[48:17] covenant with man but he's making a
[48:20] covenant with God and now because he was
[48:23] making a covenant with God that Covenant
[48:26] was eternal it could not fail
[48:30] may God help us
[48:32] remember he wants to make a covenant
[48:35] he wants to make a covenant with you and
[48:37] we say it okay by the way this is just a
[48:41] background of the sermon that is coming
[48:43] because I've been preparing it for quite
[48:45] some time so I just wanted this one to
[48:47] be an introduction
[48:50] so if you catch this one then when the
[48:52] other one comes you will say Amen
[48:55] or else I might remain by myself to say
[48:57] Amen
[49:01] oh yes
[49:03] so that was Opera
[49:07] now listen to this
[49:09] the prophet says
[49:13] in the message this day this day this
[49:16] scripture is fulfilled paragraph 235 not
[49:19] one time has the history Church of the
[49:22] world ever had an evangelist to go to it
[49:26] with a name ending ham
[49:31] until this day
[49:36] oh my
[49:39] so for Abraham God had to identify
[49:45] himself
[49:46] with apram before he could make a
[49:49] covenant with him
[49:51] now here the prophet is saying
[49:54] there has never been
[49:59] I'm evangelist
[50:02] with a name ending in harm but with
[50:06] seven letters
[50:08] Graham had six letters
[50:12] so we have Branham
[50:15] seven letters
[50:17] so we can say God has taken part of his
[50:21] name
[50:22] and joined it to this man
[50:26] so that now he can make a covenant with
[50:29] him
[50:31] now how do we become beneficiaries of
[50:34] that Covenant
[50:37] the scripture says he who receives a
[50:40] prophet in the name of the Prophet
[50:42] receives the prophet's reward
[50:46] I wonder how many people have received
[50:49] the prophet
[50:55] we
[50:57] he who receives the prophet for you to
[51:00] become a beneficiary of that Covenant
[51:02] then you must receive the prophet
[51:05] so if you have received the prophet
[51:08] William Marion pranham
[51:13] there is one thing to say you have
[51:14] received the prophet
[51:16] then there is another thing to live the
[51:19] life of the message that he brought
[51:23] so for you to say that you have received
[51:26] that message or for you to say you have
[51:29] received the prophet then you must live
[51:31] the life
[51:34] it is your life
[51:36] that will prove
[51:38] whether you have received the prophet
[51:41] may God help us
[51:45] oh my
[51:48] so far so good
[51:49] are you following my testimony
[51:55] may God help me to bring this testimony
[51:58] in the right way
[52:00] that people will get it
[52:06] but don't pick up quarrel with me it's
[52:08] my my it's my testimony
[52:10] so you can also make yours
[52:12] [Laughter]
[52:16] amen may may God help us
[52:25] I will not be long tonight
[52:27] being the first fast service of the year
[52:30] but if I stretch a little bit you bear
[52:32] with me
[52:36] because I remember
[52:38] my friend was was my my friend came
[52:41] where I was seated and then he was like
[52:42] why can't you say something I couldn't
[52:44] say something at that time because I
[52:46] knew I will have time to give my
[52:48] testimony
[52:49] so I have all the time
[52:53] but I'm following the thought of our
[52:55] pastor that God has said the calls for
[53:00] 2023.
[53:02] so we are following which is which is
[53:04] this core
[53:06] and thank you forever brother Paul you
[53:09] say that you sang that song
[53:11] he has called me and I've answered
[53:14] so I will follow all the way
[53:17] so you have to follow all the way until
[53:22] your character becomes God's character
[53:30] if I may go ahead of my someone let's
[53:33] read this scripture because this is
[53:35] going to be our
[53:37] our subject for today
[53:40] John chapter 10.
[53:53] John chapter 10.
[54:02] verse 30.
[54:05] it says I and my father are one
[54:18] I and my father are one
[54:23] when Jesus Christ said I and my father
[54:27] are one
[54:31] the Pharisees picked up quarrel
[54:36] oh
[54:40] so if you miss anything in our service
[54:42] tonight take that scripture that I and
[54:46] my father are one
[54:49] if you can come to that point my brother
[54:51] my sister where you can say I and my
[54:55] father are one
[54:56] even the Pharisees in our meetings will
[54:59] pick a quarter with you
[55:05] so that is the climax of our calling
[55:09] I and my father are one
[55:13] and that is all that God is looking for
[55:16] in our meetings for us to get to a point
[55:19] where you can say I and my father are
[55:22] one
[55:23] at that time the human element is not
[55:26] there
[55:27] at that time you are no longer a human
[55:30] being
[55:31] you will be seated here you can talk you
[55:35] can shake hands but you are not here
[55:38] when you come to a point where you can
[55:41] say I and my father are one
[55:49] so that is the set call for our 2023
[55:53] Lord lead me until I come to a point
[55:57] where I can say I and my father are one
[56:04] it's gonna happen
[56:06] that's why we come for for the service
[56:07] so that he's we are work in progress
[56:11] so as we approach the year 2023 let that
[56:15] be your prayer I want to hit that Mark
[56:17] where I can say I and my father are one
[56:24] anything short of that you are just a
[56:26] church member
[56:35] foreign
[56:37] [Music]
[56:42] now
[56:44] we talked about that agreement
[56:47] that
[56:48] how the Chinese used to use to make
[56:52] covenants our agreements
[56:55] they could take a piece of paper
[56:57] you take your laundry
[56:59] then because they didn't know how to
[57:00] write so they just used to take a piece
[57:03] of paper
[57:04] and they tear that piece of paper
[57:07] so they give you your part and the other
[57:10] part remains in the in the cleaning or
[57:13] in the dry cleaning
[57:15] so when you come to claim your property
[57:19] you have to come with what you are given
[57:25] oh my
[57:29] I expected a very big amen
[57:31] you have to come with what you are given
[57:37] so they take what you are given they
[57:41] match it what with what remained in
[57:44] their laundry
[57:47] if it doesn't match
[57:51] you are told go away you are a pretender
[58:04] please don't don't pick a call with my
[58:07] testimony
[58:09] we are coming closer Home
[58:12] this is my inspiration for 2023
[58:18] I want to come to a point where I can
[58:20] say I and my father are one
[58:29] okay
[58:34] oh my okay
[58:43] listen to this
[58:52] there in the message Israel in Egypt
[58:55] there God showed Abram
[58:58] what he was going to do that through the
[59:01] seed of Isaac he would bring forth his
[59:04] only begotten son Christ and was slain
[59:07] Yonder between the heavens and the Earth
[59:10] when the sun went down the Blackness
[59:13] over the Earth and there he tore his
[59:16] part
[59:16] God pulled his soul out of him and he
[59:20] wrote a covenant with the families of
[59:22] the earth I hope we were part of that
[59:25] family okay
[59:26] when that precious and adulteriorated
[59:30] blood of the almighty God dribbling from
[59:33] Emmanuel's veins he tore that soul out
[59:36] of him he said my God my God why hast
[59:40] Thou forsaken me his face full of
[59:42] mockery speed the crown of quail mockery
[59:45] pulled down over his his Pro his nails
[59:49] drove was Roman spikes his his back
[59:53] ribbon until his ribs shot through
[59:56] swinging on the cross screaming dying
[1:00:00] Cena's death the sin of the world upon
[1:00:03] him and there God rivaled his sights
[1:00:07] tore his soul out of him when he said
[1:00:10] into the enhance I commend my spirit and
[1:00:13] he dropped his head under the Earth
[1:00:15] Shook and Purge belched out its rocks
[1:00:19] there he is there God was making a
[1:00:23] covenant
[1:00:31] now
[1:00:33] paragraph 94 of the same message now
[1:00:36] here he comes don't Riven tour to Pieces
[1:00:39] his soul went to God God blessed him and
[1:00:43] then his soul returned back in the form
[1:00:46] of the baptism of the holy ghost that
[1:00:48] comes into every believer
[1:00:51] to sanctify clean up their mind clean up
[1:00:55] their heart live a portion of the Holy
[1:00:58] Ghost in there here and there and when
[1:01:02] the Holy Ghost is given out that same
[1:01:04] holy spirit that brought the body of
[1:01:06] Jesus Christ out of the Grave will will
[1:01:10] rupture and that Covenant has to
[1:01:13] dovetail as he taught as he taught there
[1:01:17] and became the body went back to God and
[1:01:20] the Spirit came back to the Earth then
[1:01:23] your spirit will have to be the same
[1:01:26] kind of spirit
[1:01:28] or it will miss that place all together
[1:01:33] remember we said the Chinese they had to
[1:01:37] give you a piece you go with it so that
[1:01:40] is what you will bring
[1:01:42] so he has given you the holy spirit so
[1:01:45] that spirit that was in him
[1:01:48] it has to be the same Spirit In You
[1:01:52] and the prophet is using the word
[1:01:53] dovetail so this it has to be the same
[1:01:58] what was in him has to be in you
[1:02:02] then by that you can say I and my father
[1:02:06] are the same
[1:02:09] or I and my father are one
[1:02:14] can it happen
[1:02:18] can it happen
[1:02:20] that's what he's looking for
[1:02:22] that is the purpose of the Covenant
[1:02:25] so he wants to make a covenant how he
[1:02:29] can only make a covenant remember we say
[1:02:31] it as long as you remain a man or a
[1:02:34] woman there is no way you will feel you
[1:02:36] will fulfill you are part of the
[1:02:37] Covenant
[1:02:39] so it has to be God making a covenant
[1:02:43] with God
[1:02:47] and we started by saying you make an
[1:02:49] agreement for something
[1:02:52] to achieve something
[1:02:54] so that's what we what we will look for
[1:02:56] or that's what we will discuss next time
[1:03:00] why he has made a covenant with you what
[1:03:04] does he want to achieve
[1:03:09] for those who are in let's preach we we
[1:03:11] talked about it briefly we said he makes
[1:03:15] a covenant with you so that you can
[1:03:19] fulfill in the message what the
[1:03:21] Holocaust was given for he says so that
[1:03:23] you can continue the work that he did
[1:03:27] not finish
[1:03:29] what was part of that work
[1:03:32] he was to forgive sins
[1:03:34] so if you have an unforgiving spirit
[1:03:38] there is no way he can make a covenant
[1:03:39] with you and there's more thing you walk
[1:03:42] away there is no way he can make a
[1:03:44] covenant with you
[1:03:48] he was to impart eternal life
[1:03:55] so you are here if he makes a covenant
[1:03:58] with you he wants you to impart eternal
[1:04:00] life
[1:04:01] somebody talks to you then
[1:04:05] you talk you talk to him back or harm
[1:04:08] it changes the person
[1:04:11] that is if he has met a covenant with
[1:04:13] you
[1:04:17] amen so far so good
[1:04:21] I hope you are following my testimony
[1:04:26] oh my goodness
[1:04:29] okay
[1:04:38] still in the message faith
[1:04:42] paragraph e45 the prophet says then what
[1:04:46] did God do at Calvary he took Christ
[1:04:49] Jesus his son and put him on the cross
[1:04:52] and he tore him in two he rented the
[1:04:56] soul from the body and he took the body
[1:04:59] up into heaven and sent back the Holy
[1:05:02] Ghost to the church that on that day The
[1:05:05] Same Spirit that was upon Christ Jesus
[1:05:08] has to be in the church
[1:05:12] is that too much for us
[1:05:19] if we can hit to that point where you
[1:05:22] can say I and my father are one
[1:05:27] if we if each one of us can get to that
[1:05:30] point it will make the work for the
[1:05:32] pastor easier
[1:05:36] where you can say I and my father are
[1:05:40] one
[1:05:43] okay
[1:05:45] so that on that day The Same Spirit that
[1:05:49] was upon Christ Jesus has to be in his
[1:05:53] church to dovetail one with the other on
[1:05:55] that day and the god swore by himself
[1:05:58] that he he would raise that church up a
[1:06:02] glorious Church how can it fail that is
[1:06:05] God's Everlasting Eternal Covenant he
[1:06:08] swore by himself
[1:06:13] he cannot make a covenant with man
[1:06:17] he wants to make a covenant with God
[1:06:20] I want to make I want God to make a
[1:06:22] covenant with me
[1:06:24] but remember he can only make a covenant
[1:06:27] with me if the human element has to be
[1:06:30] taken away
[1:06:34] amen
[1:06:37] hey
[1:06:39] now listen to this love story I love it
[1:06:42] so much
[1:06:43] I hope you'll also love it
[1:06:46] that's why I included it in in my
[1:06:48] testimony
[1:06:49] okay
[1:06:51] the prophet says in the message Hebrews
[1:06:54] chapter 7
[1:06:55] from paragraph 3 57. how did David
[1:06:59] Livingstone make a covenant with the
[1:07:02] African negro to go into his land he
[1:07:05] went and got the chief that he could
[1:07:08] pass through up there to preach the
[1:07:10] gospel and to do the work and they took
[1:07:14] a glass of wine here is the Covenant of
[1:07:17] the Negro in Africa they had a class of
[1:07:20] wine and the nickel Chief blocked his
[1:07:23] own veins and bled them out in this
[1:07:27] glass of wine and David Livingston
[1:07:29] plucked his own veins and bled it out in
[1:07:33] the class of wine
[1:07:36] this tired it up
[1:07:39] Livingstone drunk half of it and the
[1:07:42] necro Chief drank half of it then they
[1:07:46] give a present one to another
[1:07:51] this is the part I love
[1:07:54] David Livingston said
[1:07:58] to the chief what do you require of me
[1:08:04] then he said that white court that you
[1:08:07] caught on saw Livingston took his coat
[1:08:10] off and give it to the necro chief he
[1:08:13] said what do you require
[1:08:16] allow me to explain this
[1:08:19] the chief he was interested in the White
[1:08:23] Court
[1:08:24] of doctor Livingston
[1:08:27] why he was interested in the gift of
[1:08:31] healing
[1:08:38] what that gift of healing
[1:08:41] no wonder most of our testimonies are
[1:08:44] centered around healing
[1:08:46] so it shows if we were there on which
[1:08:49] side we could have been
[1:08:51] because here are two people
[1:08:54] the African chief and David Livingstone
[1:08:58] Livingstone when
[1:09:01] he when he asked the when the African
[1:09:03] Chief asked what do you want from me
[1:09:09] David Livingston said I want that spear
[1:09:17] okay
[1:09:18] allow me to say this the spear under the
[1:09:21] sword can do the same the same job
[1:09:24] if somebody comes here with a spear I'm
[1:09:27] sure all these seats will be vacant
[1:09:31] and if somebody comes here with a sword
[1:09:34] the same the same thing will happen
[1:09:37] so which means the spear under the sword
[1:09:40] will do the same job
[1:09:43] so we can reframe it and say David
[1:09:45] Livingstone said give me that sword
[1:09:51] okay listen to the story now
[1:09:58] a great spear that you caught in your
[1:10:00] hand because he knowed he could go in
[1:10:03] with art so that he took the spear and
[1:10:07] they were brothers because they met a
[1:10:09] covenant
[1:10:11] the Covenant was not just drinking the
[1:10:14] wine
[1:10:17] the Covenant was exchanging the gifts
[1:10:22] now when it comes to exchanging the
[1:10:24] gifts what do you ask
[1:10:29] David Livingstone he knew
[1:10:32] that when he gets that sword or that
[1:10:35] spear he can now go with the spear
[1:10:40] let me read the story
[1:10:44] and as we are and as he went forth the
[1:10:47] tribes would run out to kill him he
[1:10:49] raised this sacred spear
[1:10:52] and they knew who is the owner of the
[1:10:56] spear
[1:11:05] you raised the sword
[1:11:09] and the enemy will know who is the owner
[1:11:12] of this world
[1:11:17] so instead of asking for the white coat
[1:11:23] ask for the sword
[1:11:28] so what happens when you have the sword
[1:11:30] the enemy will know Who is the
[1:11:39] is there okay
[1:11:43] so now we can start
[1:11:46] in the message indictment the prophet
[1:11:48] says paragraph 62 I am you as Lord I lay
[1:11:52] myself on this order just as consecrated
[1:11:55] as I know how to make myself
[1:11:59] take the world from me Lord
[1:12:02] make the things from me that is
[1:12:05] perishable
[1:12:06] give me the imperishable things the word
[1:12:09] of God
[1:12:11] may I be able to live that word so
[1:12:14] closely till the word will be in me and
[1:12:18] I in the word
[1:12:24] granted Lord may I never turn from it
[1:12:27] may I hold that King's sword so right so
[1:12:31] tightly creep it so closely granted Lord
[1:12:36] I went up in Canyon
[1:12:39] climbed I climbed Plum up where the ecos
[1:12:43] was flying around
[1:12:45] I was watching some deer standing there
[1:12:49] I knelt down to pray and raised up my
[1:12:52] hands and a sword struck my hand I
[1:12:56] looked around I thought what is that am
[1:13:00] I am I not beside myself here is that
[1:13:04] sword in my hand
[1:13:08] bright shiny crystalline in the sun I
[1:13:12] say it now there is not people in in
[1:13:15] miles or away from me from here this
[1:13:18] Canyon where could that have come from I
[1:13:22] had a voice said that is the King's
[1:13:24] sword
[1:13:29] oh I said a king's night a man with a
[1:13:33] sword
[1:13:34] he The Voice came back said not a king
[1:13:37] sword but the Kings sword the word of
[1:13:42] the Lord
[1:13:43] said fear not it is only the third pool
[1:13:50] okay
[1:13:52] a brother you can give us that slight
[1:13:54] now
[1:13:57] flight number 13.
[1:14:02] brother mavin presented this one and I
[1:14:04] picked this one from here so
[1:14:07] okay
[1:14:08] now
[1:14:12] the first pool
[1:14:14] was to conduct the body
[1:14:18] are you following
[1:14:20] the first pool was to conduct the body
[1:14:23] what for sign in the hand that is for
[1:14:27] healing
[1:14:30] hello
[1:14:34] second pool was discernment
[1:14:38] brother what do you say
[1:14:41] I I I I I I
[1:14:43] wish I I came with that Court where the
[1:14:47] Prophet says
[1:14:48] there was a case then I think I think it
[1:14:51] was Sister woods so her mother was sick
[1:14:54] then they went to the prophet and said
[1:14:58] has God shown you anything
[1:15:02] has God spoken to you about the case
[1:15:06] then the prophet says he was rebuked
[1:15:09] for waiting for a sign
[1:15:11] instead of relying on the promise
[1:15:14] so the promise is more sure than the
[1:15:18] sign
[1:15:19] the sign is to attract the small fish
[1:15:26] are we following Saints
[1:15:28] so the first pool under the second pool
[1:15:32] is just for the body
[1:15:35] or the spirit
[1:15:36] but the 30 pool now is to conduct the
[1:15:40] soul and that's why now the sword that
[1:15:45] came in the hands of the Prophet when
[1:15:47] you get that swallow that sword where
[1:15:50] does it direct it directs to the soul
[1:15:55] and once it changes you from inside
[1:15:58] then you can come to a point where you
[1:16:01] can say I and my father are one
[1:16:10] are we following Saints
[1:16:13] okay
[1:16:19] amen
[1:16:25] oh and Justin I thought now ever who
[1:16:28] that is has talked to me all my life
[1:16:31] since a little a little bit baby boy
[1:16:34] he's standing right here and I can't see
[1:16:37] him at all I said the Kings sword
[1:16:42] that would be God is the king and what
[1:16:46] is this what the word
[1:16:51] so let me
[1:16:52] ask we enter
[1:16:55] 2023
[1:16:57] let this this is now my prayer let me
[1:17:01] live so close to the word until I become
[1:17:05] that word
[1:17:08] so that I can now get to a point where I
[1:17:11] can say I and my father are one
[1:17:17] so that is the call
[1:17:19] for 2023 God has set the call for us
[1:17:24] as a church as a family as an individual
[1:17:28] God has set the call
[1:17:33] I told you I I told our pastor you don't
[1:17:35] know what that statement means because I
[1:17:38] told him that would be my my sermon
[1:17:42] so he wherever he is he's okay with me
[1:17:46] thank you
[1:17:49] okay
[1:17:51] now do you see the call
[1:17:54] that is the call
[1:17:56] God has said for us
[1:18:00] until we come to a point where you can
[1:18:04] say I and my father are one
[1:18:11] amen
[1:18:14] may God help us
[1:18:16] okay
[1:18:19] listen to this
[1:18:21] now in the message Revelation chapter 4
[1:18:24] part 2 paragraph 198 notice in half
[1:18:28] circle half's not yet half is not yet
[1:18:31] known now surely these things represent
[1:18:35] something
[1:18:36] all these things I've been talking about
[1:18:38] they represent something
[1:18:40] now let's see the picture
[1:18:43] because if you are just seeing there the
[1:18:46] negative you need to see the positive
[1:18:49] okay now in Exodus chapter 23 verse 13
[1:18:53] and in Hebrews 6 12 God made a covenant
[1:18:56] with himself
[1:18:58] and the sword by himself Hebrews 13
[1:19:01] tells us that or Hebrews and 9 13 but it
[1:19:05] was eight that he swore by himself there
[1:19:08] was no greater swear
[1:19:11] swear by when he told Abraham and Isaac
[1:19:14] there he told Abram that he would make a
[1:19:17] covenant with him an Everlasting
[1:19:20] Covenant a covenant is always made by an
[1:19:24] earth so there is nobody you take an
[1:19:27] Earth by somebody greater than you take
[1:19:30] an Earth by your mother take an Earth by
[1:19:33] your nation take an Earth by something
[1:19:35] take an oath by God but you can't take
[1:19:38] an oath unless it is somebody greater
[1:19:41] than you
[1:19:44] and there was nobody greater than God so
[1:19:48] he took an earth himself
[1:19:53] what an assurance
[1:19:57] that he took an oath by himself
[1:20:00] so in that case he wants to make a
[1:20:03] covenant with himself
[1:20:06] anything short of that you are just a
[1:20:08] church member God have mercy on me
[1:20:14] he wants to make a covenant
[1:20:17] 2023 God wants to make a covenant
[1:20:23] somebody will surrender himself or
[1:20:25] herself
[1:20:27] until he or she comes to a point where
[1:20:30] he or she can say I and my father are
[1:20:34] one
[1:20:37] somebody will do it
[1:20:40] and that's why I said my testimony
[1:20:43] that is where I want to be
[1:20:46] that is my prayer that is my desire that
[1:20:50] is where I want to be
[1:20:52] anything short of that I'll just be a
[1:20:54] church member
[1:20:55] and they don't help me yeah you can help
[1:20:58] to keep to keep company
[1:21:00] yeah
[1:21:01] I was saying this I think it was in
[1:21:03] Edmonton
[1:21:05] that uh
[1:21:08] when you start thinking about the
[1:21:10] rapture
[1:21:13] when you start seriously thinking about
[1:21:15] the rapture
[1:21:17] then you hear WhatsApp clip click
[1:21:19] when you check it is a reminder about
[1:21:21] potluck
[1:21:23] so it changes your mind from thinking
[1:21:25] about the rapture now you start planning
[1:21:27] what you take to the airport lock
[1:21:31] because the devil knows when you start
[1:21:34] thinking so close you just feel I wish
[1:21:37] the Rapture could come tomorrow
[1:21:40] when you come to that point and the
[1:21:42] devil knows so he brings something that
[1:21:45] will distract your attention
[1:21:48] so that you change your mind
[1:21:50] foreign
[1:21:58] may we not be at the mercy of the devil
[1:22:05] amen
[1:22:09] in the message Jehovah childre
[1:22:12] but this Covenant was not met between
[1:22:15] God and man God made this Covenant with
[1:22:18] himself it is all together by grace
[1:22:25] it is not what you have done or what you
[1:22:28] can do it is by grace
[1:22:33] there is no law to eat at all he never
[1:22:36] said if you do a certain thing he said I
[1:22:39] have already blessed thee
[1:22:42] and that now brings us to pretestination
[1:22:47] how will you know
[1:22:49] that you are pretestinated
[1:22:55] he flushes your citizenship
[1:23:00] and you realize you don't belong here
[1:23:12] amen
[1:23:14] now
[1:23:16] back now to our scripture Saint John
[1:23:18] chapter 10.
[1:23:21] please to encourage those ones who are
[1:23:23] already thinking home we are almost
[1:23:25] concluding so you can wake up
[1:23:30] let's finish now this scripture
[1:23:32] I know you have been reading about it
[1:23:34] but let's look at it now from a
[1:23:36] different angle
[1:23:38] verse 30. I and my father are one
[1:23:43] then the Jews two cup stones again to
[1:23:47] Stone him
[1:23:48] Jesus answered them
[1:23:50] any good works have I shot you from my
[1:23:54] father for which of those Works do you
[1:23:57] stunn me
[1:24:00] now we just this good works
[1:24:04] I was reading in the morning then I I
[1:24:06] pumped into the
[1:24:08] Matthew chapter 4.
[1:24:10] okay you can read it at your own time
[1:24:13] which are these good works
[1:24:16] they said for the good works we have no
[1:24:18] problem
[1:24:20] now which are these good works
[1:24:24] when they were hungry he multiplied the
[1:24:26] bread
[1:24:28] that was a good work
[1:24:31] when they were sick he healed their sick
[1:24:36] you can imagine you can even imagine
[1:24:38] those ones who brought there sick person
[1:24:40] over the roof and dropped him they were
[1:24:43] serious
[1:24:44] yeah they wanted their person to get
[1:24:46] healed so that was a good work
[1:24:49] they had no problem with that
[1:24:51] so as far as
[1:24:53] getting food is concerned we have no
[1:24:55] problem with that
[1:24:57] as far as healing in the sick we have no
[1:25:00] problem with that
[1:25:01] oh my goodness he even raised the Dead
[1:25:05] oh we have no problem with that that was
[1:25:07] good
[1:25:10] then as far as the good works are
[1:25:13] concerned they had no problem
[1:25:17] so we can also bring it closer Home as
[1:25:19] far as the good works are concerned
[1:25:22] we have no problem
[1:25:24] where it will become a problem is when
[1:25:27] one of us
[1:25:29] says I and my father are one
[1:25:38] We Are One in our meetings
[1:25:40] will come to a point where he or she can
[1:25:43] say I and my father are
[1:25:48] I will not be surprised if the
[1:25:51] they need to be careful some of the
[1:25:53] statements you can very easily blaspheme
[1:25:56] and they say they say to him
[1:25:59] for the good works we have no problem
[1:26:01] but for blasphemy
[1:26:03] you being a man you call yourself God
[1:26:13] so
[1:26:16] I
[1:26:18] and my father
[1:26:20] are one
[1:26:24] can we get to that point
[1:26:28] can we get to that point
[1:26:30] where you can say I
[1:26:32] and my father are one
[1:26:34] leave around the good things the good
[1:26:36] works
[1:26:39] those ones are okay they will help the
[1:26:41] body yeah
[1:26:43] but where you come to a point that you
[1:26:47] can say I and my father are one
[1:26:53] you would be in this world but you don't
[1:26:55] belong in this world
[1:27:01] we can prefer shipping here but you are
[1:27:03] not here
[1:27:04] we can talk about so many things but you
[1:27:07] are not here
[1:27:08] why because from inside
[1:27:13] he was the word
[1:27:15] now you have to become the one
[1:27:19] for God to make a covenant with God God
[1:27:22] is the word so you become the word then
[1:27:24] he makes a covenant with the word
[1:27:27] and until you become the word there is
[1:27:29] no way you will say I and my father are
[1:27:32] one
[1:27:33] so now that is the challenge for us for
[1:27:36] 2023
[1:27:39] .
[1:27:42] can we make now that one to pay our
[1:27:44] testimony
[1:27:47] that was what mutated's testimony
[1:27:50] can you also make it your testimony
[1:27:54] but I want to come to a point where I
[1:27:58] can say I and my father are one
[1:28:05] can it happen
[1:28:08] can it happen
[1:28:11] he has shown us the way
[1:28:13] he cannot just leave us in the
[1:28:14] wilderness no he has shown us the way
[1:28:17] how we can do it
[1:28:19] and we can become we can become that
[1:28:22] because he wants to make a covenant
[1:28:27] I wonder how many of us
[1:28:30] are ready for God to make a covenant
[1:28:32] with them
[1:28:40] he met a covenant with the prophet
[1:28:45] and why he met a covenant with a prophet
[1:28:49] Peter Paul said
[1:28:51] you could not differentiate the way he
[1:28:53] treated an enemy and the way he treated
[1:28:56] a friend
[1:29:00] so by that he could say I and my father
[1:29:04] are one
[1:29:07] he could say I was not the one but I was
[1:29:11] only there
[1:29:16] yeah
[1:29:19] I was not the one
[1:29:20] I was not the one who did this I was
[1:29:23] only there
[1:29:26] then we can say he could say or he could
[1:29:29] have said I and my father I
[1:29:38] that is my testimony
[1:29:40] that is my prayer for 2023. let us stand
[1:29:44] up
[1:29:48] [Applause]
[1:29:52] I and my father
[1:29:55] are one
[1:29:57] that is my target
[1:29:59] that is my prayer
[1:30:03] so let this year be idea with that
[1:30:07] difference
[1:30:11] let it not be ah no more thing oh it is
[1:30:15] another awareness day we are going to
[1:30:16] each other oh it is another Sunday no
[1:30:19] let's have a different vision
[1:30:23] I
[1:30:24] and my father are one
[1:30:27] the prophet says when you come to that
[1:30:31] point where you can say I and my father
[1:30:35] are one then the Jews will have to
[1:30:37] manifest themselves in our meetings
[1:30:40] those who will pick up quarrel with you
[1:30:42] and say oh no you are almost you are
[1:30:44] almost blasphemy
[1:30:47] if it means that if that means
[1:30:49] blaspheming let me blaspheme it that way
[1:30:52] where I can say I and my father
[1:30:57] or happy day
[1:31:00] let's let's sing this let's let's let's
[1:31:03] look at the words of this song There is
[1:31:05] a verse that I like which says
[1:31:08] uh the great transaction is already made
[1:31:12] I am my Lord and He is mine
[1:31:16] if you can make it that way if you can
[1:31:19] make a resolution don't make up don't
[1:31:22] make oh people make resolution or from
[1:31:24] this no no no no no no no be supper and
[1:31:27] they know exactly what you are doing
[1:31:29] if you can say I and my father are one
[1:31:34] is my target for 2023.
[1:31:38] don't just let it not be emotional no we
[1:31:43] have seen people come with emotions but
[1:31:46] they end up living a life that brings
[1:31:49] reproach to the word of God
[1:31:53] so you have to be supper
[1:31:56] whether it means going in your closet
[1:32:00] and say Lord that is now my target for
[1:32:05] 2023 I want to Crucify My Flesh until I
[1:32:10] come to a point where I can say I and my
[1:32:14] father are one
[1:32:19] I've always looked forward
[1:32:22] for somebody to give us our testimony
[1:32:24] and say I have been praying for the
[1:32:27] baptism of the Holocaust and the court
[1:32:29] has answered my prayer if you are a
[1:32:32] doubting Thomases watch my life
[1:32:42] I will love such a person and I will
[1:32:46] love such a testimony and that's what I
[1:32:48] want to hear
[1:32:50] watch my life

[1:33:19] do you know when it comes to saying
[1:33:22] watch my life
[1:33:24] that is not just asleep by a slip of the
[1:33:26] tongue
[1:33:28] it must be something you have searched
[1:33:30] yourself

[1:36:09] before we go to the last stanza
[1:36:12] I would like us to make this service to
[1:36:14] be authentication to our lives
[1:36:18] for the year 2023
[1:36:22] I and my Lord are one
[1:36:27] so let us be sober as I asked brother
[1:36:31] Peter to come and pray for us let this
[1:36:34] be authentication Service
[1:36:37] it's the first year first service for
[1:36:40] 2023 but let it be a dedicational
[1:36:43] service
[1:36:45] I want to look different brother Peter
[1:36:47] Khan As we sing the last stanza
[1:36:52] my Lord
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:36:58] fixed on this place
[1:37:01] [Music]
[1:37:21] happy day

[1:37:45] sing every day
[1:37:56] when Jesus
[1:37:58] [Music]
[1:38:09] I believe
[1:38:11] it is no brother Gilbert that is
[1:38:13] speaking to us this evening
[1:38:17] I believe that God is speaking to us
[1:38:21] and this is a challenge to each and
[1:38:23] every one
[1:38:25] that we can boldly say
[1:38:28] I and my father are one
[1:38:35] we have a song that we used to sing back
[1:38:37] home
[1:38:39] in a different way
[1:38:41] that what I'm doing
[1:38:44] would Jesus be pleased with whatever
[1:38:46] that I'm doing
[1:38:48] you always have to ask yourself
[1:38:51] whatever that you are doing
[1:38:54] would God be pleased
[1:38:56] if God will not be pleased then we stop
[1:39:00] I think our former Pastor used to say
[1:39:03] that anything that you are doing when
[1:39:06] you are by yourself that you cannot show
[1:39:09] somebody
[1:39:11] that means you're not supposed to do it
[1:39:13] oh yes Lord
[1:39:15] as we bow our heads
[1:39:17] I want us all to pray yes
[1:39:21] [Music]
[1:39:24] yes and tell the Lord to help us
[1:39:29] that as we enter into this year
[1:39:32] that we can boldly say

[1:39:50] Lord we never come before you
[1:39:53] that you leave us orphans

[1:40:18] and father brother Gilbert has come
[1:40:20] tonight even if we don't have anything
[1:40:23] he is come
[1:40:25] to help us to study the year

[1:40:35] by telling our children yes
[1:40:38] yes that watch my life
[1:40:43] for somebody to come out and say that
