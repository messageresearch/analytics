[43:05] I covet for your prayers
[43:09] let's turn to our bypass
[43:12] Colossians
[43:17] far Colossians 1
[43:37] if you are there you can say Amen
[43:40] okay good
[43:42] past 24. who now rejoice in my
[43:46] sufferings for you and fill up that
[43:49] which is behind of the afflictions of
[43:51] Christ in my flesh
[43:53] for his body's sake which is the charge
[43:57] wherefore I have met a minister
[44:00] according to the dispensations of God
[44:02] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[44:06] the word of God even the mystery which
[44:10] has been hit from HS and from
[44:12] Generations but now is made manifest to
[44:16] his Saints
[44:18] scripture
[44:20] I'll read it again even the mystery
[44:23] which has been hit from HS and from
[44:26] Generations but now is made manifest to
[44:30] his Saints
[44:32] to whom God would make known what is the
[44:36] riches of the glory of this mystery
[44:38] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[44:42] you the hope of glory chapter 2 verse 9.
[44:48] for in him
[44:50] dwareth all the fullness of the godhead
[44:54] bodily
[44:56] let's also turn to
[44:58] Saint Luke chapter 17 verse 30. the
[45:03] scripture we know very well
[45:13] Saint Luke 17 30.
[45:25] even thus shall it be in the day when
[45:29] the son of man is revealed
[45:33] may God bless the reading of the what
[45:35] you can take your seats
[45:46] now this evening
[45:49] I want to change a little bit
[45:52] men have known me and they called me or
[45:55] they refer they refer to me as an
[45:57] evangelist
[45:59] but tonight I'm going to teach
[46:01] [Laughter]
[46:03] so I want to join my other colleagues
[46:07] what who teach and actually I have been
[46:11] teaching all along
[46:13] and what happens if you stay without if
[46:15] you live without with a teacher by
[46:17] osmosis you also become a teacher
[46:23] so now this evening
[46:26] I wonder how many of us knows that Saint
[46:31] Luke 17 30 and what it means
[46:34] don't raise your hand I don't want to
[46:37] how many of us knows exactly what that
[46:40] scripture means to us
[46:44] and I wonder
[46:46] how many are not sure they know exactly
[46:50] what that scripture means to us
[46:55] don't assume that you know it
[47:00] and I wonder how men are here and they
[47:03] have no idea even those ones who are on
[47:06] the internet they have no idea what that
[47:08] scripture means to us
[47:11] we always quote it oh Saint Luke 17 30
[47:14] Saint Luke 17 30. but what is it
[47:21] so
[47:22] in continuation with what the pastor has
[47:25] been preaching and what we started what
[47:27] we were talking about during the the
[47:29] meetings
[47:32] um just going to take a little bit Step
[47:34] Ahead
[47:36] or further than where we left about the
[47:39] resurrection
[47:40] now
[47:42] two thousand years ago Jesus rose from
[47:45] the dead
[47:49] he had been a crucified and his body had
[47:52] been buried in the grave
[47:54] but on Sunday morning at the rising of
[47:58] the Sun that is s-u-n the quickening
[48:01] power came from Heaven rolled the stone
[48:05] away then United with the body and he
[48:10] resurrected
[48:15] the quickening power
[48:18] remember the scripture that the person
[48:22] read for us on Sunday
[48:24] Romans 8 11.
[48:28] if that Spirit dwareth In You
[48:31] then it will Quicken your mortal body
[48:34] now it is it was that quickening power
[48:38] that went into the grave
[48:41] rolled away the stone went into the
[48:44] grave United with the body and raised
[48:48] him up
[48:51] now what is that quickening power
[49:02] amen now
[49:05] the Easter seal was broken when he rose
[49:08] up
[49:10] what was the Easter serum
[49:13] nobody knew whether there was life after
[49:17] death
[49:18] why all the heroes of the Old Testament
[49:24] they had conquered everything you can
[49:27] talk of Moses how he conquered almost
[49:29] everything you can talk of Daniel you
[49:32] can talk of many of them but the thing
[49:35] that overcame them was death
[49:38] but now here comes Jesus Christ he dies
[49:43] and the quickening power comes and
[49:47] raises him up
[49:54] amen
[49:56] God help us
[49:58] now
[49:59] we are here to prove that we are
[50:03] beneficiaries of the Resurrection
[50:07] and we are here to prove that he's alive
[50:13] if you cannot prove that he is alive by
[50:15] your life
[50:17] then your experience has a question mark
[50:22] right sorry I didn't want to go that
[50:24] line
[50:26] I wanted to be a gentleman
[50:30] amen
[50:34] now
[50:37] May brother give me that the fastest
[50:39] light huh
[50:43] okay
[50:46] the body of Jesus Christ
[50:49] the prophet says
[50:51] a hundred percent Jesus Christ was human
[50:56] and a hundred percent he was God
[51:03] so now that's what we want to prove this
[51:05] evening
[51:06] so that the body that was born by Mary
[51:11] a hundred percent it was human being
[51:14] but now what made him God was when the
[51:19] scripture where we read in Colossians
[51:21] that the fullness of the Court had
[51:24] bodily dwelled in him
[51:27] when that fullness of the godhead came
[51:30] in him now it made him God
[51:38] so that the body was just like any other
[51:41] body he had their Temptations He had
[51:44] trials and everything in every way he
[51:47] was tempted
[51:48] but inside him that weakening power that
[51:53] God had
[51:56] that it dwelled in him that is what made
[51:58] the difference
[52:01] so now we can say
[52:03] the body plus the fullness of the
[52:08] godhead bodily makes him the son of man
[52:12] that is what made him the son of man
[52:15] the fullness of the godhead when it
[52:18] unites with the body
[52:21] hello
[52:25] just where we meet with me we'll get the
[52:27] direction we are going there
[52:28] we want to see
[52:30] how the ministry of the son of man is
[52:34] working today
[52:36] because when we say in Saint Luke 17 30
[52:40] oh Saint Luke 17 30. even so thus when
[52:44] the son of man shall be revealed now we
[52:47] are living in the days of the ministry
[52:50] of the son of man
[52:52] so now how does that Ministry come about
[52:56] if I may go ahead of my someone that
[52:59] Ministry comes when the fullness of the
[53:02] godhead bodily comes and unites with the
[53:06] body then it deforms now the son of man
[53:18] may God help us
[53:22] so that if
[53:23] the stiffness of the Court head bodily
[53:26] is what we are calling now the
[53:28] quickening power
[53:32] outside that or without that quickening
[53:36] power or without that the court head
[53:39] bodily in the body of in your body or in
[53:43] my body you are just like in any other
[53:46] normal human being
[53:48] and there is no difference
[53:50] with the drunkards outside
[53:52] the only difference maybe you come to
[53:54] church
[54:02] the ministry of the son of man
[54:06] when the fullness of godhead bodily
[54:09] dwelled in him he was called the son of
[54:13] man
[54:15] now
[54:17] whether the body died
[54:20] and it was buried
[54:22] it was that fullness of the godhead
[54:26] bodily that went in the grave United
[54:30] with the body and make him now to rise
[54:33] up
[54:34] for the resurrection
[54:36] it is that fullness of the godhead
[54:39] bodily which we can call in another
[54:42] words the quickening power or the entire
[54:46] Holy Spirit
[54:50] in another quote the prophet says now in
[54:55] this day the entire Holy Spirit has come
[55:00] so which means in the seven Church ages
[55:03] they didn't have the entire Holy Spirit
[55:13] amen
[55:16] now
[55:19] Matthew 27
[55:30] this one I I I I if I don't finish I
[55:34] will negotiate with the pastor so that I
[55:35] come and pursue this thought
[55:38] because we must know where we are
[55:43] Matthew 27 verse 50.
[55:50] Jesus when he had cried again with a
[55:53] loud voice yielded up the ghost
[55:57] and behold the vein of the temple was
[56:00] reigned in Twain From the top to the
[56:03] bottom and the Earth did quick and the
[56:06] Rocks reigned and the graves were opened
[56:09] and the many bodies of the Saints which
[56:12] slept a rose
[56:16] and came out of the graves after his
[56:20] resurrection and went into the holy city
[56:23] and appeared unto many
[56:26] now we say when he resurrected he was
[56:31] waived
[56:33] the other time we talked about
[56:35] being waved now when he was weaved as
[56:38] the son of man he died as the son of man
[56:42] let me try to refresh that one
[56:46] in The Cutting of kedesmani
[56:51] the fullness of the courthead bottle
[56:54] left him
[56:56] because you cannot kill God
[57:00] so when the fullness of the godhead left
[57:03] him he cried my father
[57:11] but now that the fullness of the godhead
[57:14] bodily left him for a while
[57:19] so that he couldn't so that he could
[57:22] fulfill the purpose
[57:24] he was sent for
[57:27] he was sent to die
[57:29] so that he can
[57:34] okay
[57:36] now
[57:41] when he rose up
[57:44] and he was waved
[57:47] many bodies of the Saints Resurrected
[57:52] but not everybody Resurrected
[57:56] those who are resurrected are only those
[58:00] who were buried in macapella
[58:10] where is macapella that is the place
[58:14] where Abraham bought for the burial
[58:17] place
[58:18] Sarah was buried in that place
[58:21] Abraham was buried in that place Isaac
[58:25] was buried in that place even Joseph
[58:27] when he was in Egypt he said when I die
[58:30] make sure you carry my bones
[58:33] and take them to philistine why the
[58:37] prophet says it is not written in the
[58:39] Bible you read between the lines
[58:41] why they had a revelation of where the
[58:45] resurrection will take place
[58:48] [Applause]
[58:50] so those who resurrected when Jesus
[58:53] Christ was waved to their to to them are
[58:57] only those who are buried in macapella
[59:01] and those who will resurrect from us are
[59:05] only those who are buried in Christ
[59:09] [Music]
[59:12] so you have to make sure you are buried
[59:14] in Christ
[59:17] any other place there is no Resurrection
[59:19] for you
[59:21] sorry for that for that
[59:24] so you have to make sure you are buried
[59:27] in Christ
[59:30] and the Paul tells us in Corinthians
[59:32] that by one Spirit we are
[59:37] baptized into
[59:43] one of these days we will talk about the
[59:45] mystical body
[59:47] there is the body the local body and
[59:50] there is the mystical body
[59:52] you can be in a local body but you are
[59:54] not in the mystical body
[59:57] so what is important is for you to find
[1:00:00] yourself in the mystical body
[1:00:07] that's the only thing that will help you
[1:00:09] my brother my sister
[1:00:11] to make sure you are in the mystical
[1:00:13] body and that's where Paul is saying
[1:00:16] by one spirit
[1:00:19] now if we are baptized into that body by
[1:00:22] one spirit
[1:00:23] can there be differences amongst us
[1:00:35] God help us
[1:00:38] oh my
[1:00:41] okay
[1:00:42] in the message
[1:00:44] it is the rising of the Sun
[1:00:47] it is not s-u-n anymore it is the s o n
[1:00:52] day the sun day s-o-n that that cone of
[1:00:57] wheat God's first one up from the dead
[1:01:00] is to be waved over the congregation
[1:01:02] that we are his seed and that is the
[1:01:07] first of the seed of those that slept
[1:01:10] weft upon the first day of the week on
[1:01:14] Sunday he raised up wept goodbye and and
[1:01:18] ascended up on high in the presence of
[1:01:21] the people
[1:01:24] okay
[1:01:26] so
[1:01:28] when he died
[1:01:31] let's try to say let's let's look at
[1:01:33] this one
[1:01:34] now when you take the fullness of
[1:01:37] godhead Botley
[1:01:39] inside that body we have the mayor and
[1:01:43] the female part
[1:01:51] okay let me allow that one to sink
[1:01:53] because I can see you are fighting with
[1:01:55] it in your in your minds
[1:01:58] in Genesis
[1:02:00] let's read it
[1:02:04] Genesis 1.
[1:02:13] this scripture was being quoted by the
[1:02:15] pastor the other day and nobody said
[1:02:16] amen so and I think I can now understand
[1:02:19] why you are doubting
[1:02:21] okay Genesis 1.
[1:02:27] 27 so God created man in his own image
[1:02:31] in the image of God created he him male
[1:02:35] and female created he them
[1:02:39] there are two parts
[1:02:42] one part is the bridegroom and the other
[1:02:46] part is the bride
[1:02:49] hello
[1:02:54] please follow it up with me
[1:02:57] because if you miss this part
[1:02:59] then where we are going it will be very
[1:03:01] slippery for you
[1:03:03] [Laughter]
[1:03:04] I wonder
[1:03:11] of the Court head it had two parts the
[1:03:15] bright groom and the bride
[1:03:24] okay
[1:03:26] now
[1:03:27] The Pride was in him
[1:03:31] when Jesus Christ was here walking on
[1:03:34] two feet The Pride was in him
[1:03:39] we said last time that in the beginning
[1:03:42] it was through cesarean that the pride
[1:03:45] was extracted from Adam
[1:03:49] now Christ also had to undercoat the
[1:03:53] same Caesarean to get to release to
[1:03:56] release the pride
[1:03:58] so which means the pride was in him
[1:04:03] now if the pride was in him which means
[1:04:06] when he was being crucified the gripe
[1:04:09] the bride was in him you were in him
[1:04:13] now if you are in him then when he
[1:04:16] resurrected you are also in him
[1:04:24] okay
[1:04:28] let me go ahead of my salmon now
[1:04:33] when you when Jesus Christ was walking
[1:04:38] The Pride was in him
[1:04:42] now
[1:04:45] the prophet says the pride coming of
[1:04:48] Christ
[1:04:49] now if we have the pride today
[1:04:54] then that is where the mystery is huh
[1:04:56] so if we have the pride today
[1:04:59] then where is the project room The Pride
[1:05:02] groom is now in the pride
[1:05:05] but when you see you see the pride
[1:05:09] but inside the bride there is the
[1:05:12] bridegroom
[1:05:15] if we cannot see that then our believing
[1:05:18] of the message is nothing
[1:05:22] because we are going to see now how the
[1:05:24] bridegroom comes in you
[1:05:27] we are saying the
[1:05:30] fullness of the Court heck boatly
[1:05:34] it had two parts
[1:05:36] when that fullness which we are calling
[1:05:39] the quickening power or the entire
[1:05:41] spirit
[1:05:42] came in the body when it United with the
[1:05:46] body
[1:05:46] it made him the son of man
[1:05:53] are we together so far
[1:05:57] can you say that you can now see
[1:06:00] yourself being inside the bright groom
[1:06:03] and the pride in you
[1:06:05] because if you cannot reconcile that
[1:06:07] equation okay the mathematicians maybe
[1:06:09] they are here they will challenge me if
[1:06:11] you cannot reconcile that equation that
[1:06:14] I and my father are one in that day he
[1:06:18] shall know
[1:06:19] that I am in the father
[1:06:22] the father in me and you him
[1:06:26] that reconciliation if you cannot
[1:06:28] reconcile that that that that that
[1:06:30] statement
[1:06:33] then
[1:06:35] we are just doing at the service being
[1:06:38] here
[1:06:39] because we need now to know who we are
[1:06:42] how shall We Know Who We Are
[1:06:46] when
[1:06:47] if the scripture says in that day which
[1:06:50] day
[1:06:55] which day
[1:06:56] this day
[1:06:58] so you can stand and say this day this
[1:07:01] scripture is fulfilled
[1:07:03] how is it fulfilled you can say it is
[1:07:06] now fulfilled in me
[1:07:10] you now personalize it
[1:07:14] and those are the people those are the
[1:07:16] only people who have been there in the
[1:07:17] resurrection
[1:07:20] because why there is there is erection
[1:07:22] we say it there is a letter in words
[1:07:25] when the fullness of the Court head
[1:07:28] bodily came to unite with the body it
[1:07:31] raised him up
[1:07:35] now partly we can say that is that
[1:07:39] fullness of the godhead for body was
[1:07:42] waived when it was waved over the
[1:07:45] denominations you came out of the crebes
[1:07:48] of the denominations
[1:07:54] then what next
[1:07:59] is to come to a point
[1:08:01] where
[1:08:03] you can say this day this scripture is
[1:08:07] fulfilled in me
[1:08:12] we have to come to a point where you now
[1:08:16] personalize it
[1:08:19] you have to come to a point where saying
[1:08:22] we no it is not we
[1:08:25] you even don't know whether the person
[1:08:27] seated next to you is is is part of that
[1:08:31] body
[1:08:33] so it is time to say it is me
[1:08:39] it is a personal revelation this thing
[1:08:43] has been personally revealed to you and
[1:08:46] you hold it between life and death
[1:08:51] take away anything from me but give me
[1:08:54] Jesus
[1:09:03] oh if I correct that I will not reach to
[1:09:06] where I wanted to
[1:09:10] amen
[1:09:12] okay
[1:09:18] okay
[1:09:28] now
[1:09:30] Jesus was the first to resurrect and
[1:09:33] never to die again unlike Lazarus
[1:09:38] Lazarus died and he died again
[1:09:43] and that's why if you can allow me I'll
[1:09:45] repeat this statement
[1:09:48] please don't go for the gifts
[1:09:52] call for The Giver of the gifts
[1:09:56] you can have a gift of healing
[1:10:00] you can be prayed for you get healed and
[1:10:03] tomorrow you come here you come again
[1:10:05] here for prayers right
[1:10:08] but if you get The Giver of the gifts
[1:10:11] whether this body is drowned in the
[1:10:13] ocean it doesn't matter what matters is
[1:10:16] that weakening power
[1:10:18] if you have that quickening power
[1:10:20] wherever you will be you will be
[1:10:22] Resurrected
[1:10:25] may God help us
[1:10:29] okay
[1:10:32] hey amen
[1:10:40] okay now Jesus who died was called the
[1:10:44] son of man
[1:10:46] there is nowhere he referred to himself
[1:10:49] as the son of God
[1:10:52] he always referred to himself as the son
[1:10:55] of man
[1:10:59] Now who is the son of man it is the
[1:11:03] fullness of the godhead bodily United
[1:11:06] with the flesh
[1:11:10] I want us to get that one
[1:11:12] when the fullness of godhead bodily
[1:11:16] unites with your flesh
[1:11:20] then who do you become
[1:11:25] okay
[1:11:29] on the day of Pentecost he was not waved
[1:11:32] as the son of man
[1:11:39] let me read the quotes now
[1:11:45] okay
[1:11:48] the Mighty God unveiled before us
[1:11:54] Prophet says then we find after his
[1:11:57] death burial and Resurrection he came on
[1:12:00] the day of Pentecost as Son of God
[1:12:04] the spirit in the form
[1:12:07] Holocaust what was he doing he was
[1:12:11] changing himself making himself known to
[1:12:14] his people in a different form like the
[1:12:18] Holy Spirit which is God he came to deal
[1:12:21] through the church edges as the son of
[1:12:24] God
[1:12:26] on the day of Pentecost
[1:12:30] he came down okay now let me explain
[1:12:32] that one
[1:12:36] he died
[1:12:37] as the son of man
[1:12:40] he rose as the son of man
[1:12:43] why he had the fullness of the godhead
[1:12:47] bodily in him
[1:12:48] he walked here for 40 days
[1:12:53] then he was resurrected he he he was
[1:12:56] raptured
[1:12:57] after he was ruptured then he came on
[1:13:01] the day of Pentecost now when he came
[1:13:04] back on the day of Pentecost he did not
[1:13:09] come with the whole fullness of the
[1:13:12] godhead portly the feminist Spirit left
[1:13:17] him come down now as the bride
[1:13:22] now when the feminist Spirit they came
[1:13:25] from him now he changed the form from
[1:13:29] the son of man to Son of God
[1:13:33] now he dwelled in the seven Church ages
[1:13:37] as the Son of God until
[1:13:42] in the lautition church age when they
[1:13:45] rejected him
[1:13:46] now after they rejected him they
[1:13:49] rejected who the son of God
[1:13:53] so after they rejected him as the Son of
[1:13:56] God now he had to change the form again
[1:14:01] why
[1:14:07] okay I have so many quotes but I don't
[1:14:10] have time to read everything on the day
[1:14:13] of Pentecost he came as the Son of God
[1:14:17] he did not come as the son of man why
[1:14:21] because
[1:14:25] he saw this day that you are living in
[1:14:30] what happened so he came now on Mount
[1:14:34] Sunset as the fullness of the godhead
[1:14:38] bodily why he came as the head and where
[1:14:43] was the body the body was here
[1:14:48] so now when that
[1:14:50] fullness of God God had bodily came on
[1:14:55] Mount the sunset
[1:14:57] for what so that the head now can Unite
[1:15:01] with the body now when the head unite
[1:15:04] when the head unites with the body what
[1:15:07] we say we now say the son of man so now
[1:15:12] he changed from the Son of God to Son of
[1:15:15] Man
[1:15:21] here
[1:15:23] as the son of man
[1:15:26] why the fullness of the coat head bodily
[1:15:31] came down on Mount sunset
[1:15:34] it did not remain on Mount sunset
[1:15:39] you don't have to go to mount Sunset to
[1:15:41] receive it he's here
[1:15:44] as the head
[1:15:46] for what purpose so that he can now
[1:15:49] Unite with the body
[1:15:51] and when he unites with the body now he
[1:15:54] changes the form to the son of man now
[1:15:59] we are in the ministry of the son of man
[1:16:06] that is not the mystery I have not even
[1:16:07] reached the minister Mister because the
[1:16:10] scripture we read it was talking about
[1:16:12] the mystery
[1:16:14] so I've not even come to the mystery
[1:16:17] I was just laying the foundation I'm a
[1:16:19] poor teacher
[1:16:21] I take so long
[1:16:23] to come to my point but at least now you
[1:16:26] can see where we are
[1:16:29] he's here
[1:16:32] in the ministry
[1:16:34] of the son of man
[1:16:38] why now you can see Luke 17 30 has now
[1:16:44] been fulfilled
[1:16:51] oh my
[1:16:53] now you can say I am the Fulfillment of
[1:16:57] Saint Luke 17 30.
[1:17:01] why you can now see yourself in the
[1:17:05] Fulfillment of Saint Luke 17 30.
[1:17:10] okay
[1:17:14] amen okay
[1:17:20] okay
[1:17:22] so far so good you can SN you can now
[1:17:25] see yourself
[1:17:26] now in that Ministry
[1:17:31] when he was waived
[1:17:33] after the resurrection he resurrected
[1:17:37] the Old Testament Saints
[1:17:40] now what happens if he is waved again
[1:17:44] today what will happen
[1:17:47] he will resurrect the New Testament
[1:17:49] Saints
[1:17:52] so now do you see the work that you have
[1:17:57] somebody somewhere is waiting on you
[1:18:01] somebody in the grave is waiting on you
[1:18:08] but we become so touchy
[1:18:11] we don't want to release ourselves
[1:18:13] so that he can use us
[1:18:16] we don't want to allow him to have
[1:18:18] preeminence
[1:18:22] okay
[1:18:27] that one now brings us to
[1:18:31] where I wanted to
[1:18:33] he came as the fullness of godhead
[1:18:35] bodily the head
[1:18:37] Revelation 10 1.
[1:18:40] when they rejected him as the Son of God
[1:18:43] now he came in Revelation 10 1 as the
[1:18:48] head as the Archangel the mighty angel
[1:18:52] for what purpose
[1:18:54] because the body is here so he came as
[1:18:57] the head now to unite with the body
[1:19:02] can we allow him to unite with us
[1:19:04] it is uniting time and sign
[1:19:11] but the good thing is it is an invisible
[1:19:14] Union
[1:19:17] you may not see somebody shouting crying
[1:19:20] or doing what but inside that person
[1:19:24] there is a change that is going on
[1:19:29] there is a change that is going on
[1:19:33] God help us
[1:19:36] okay
[1:19:40] oh my
[1:19:45] oh just skip so that uh
[1:19:50] okay
[1:19:51] in the message unveiling of God
[1:19:54] for
[1:19:56] for his ACT he changes his form then he
[1:20:00] came the form of a son of man
[1:20:02] for the reformers age Wesley Luda and
[1:20:06] down through them we find out that they
[1:20:08] got it so bundled up just like the
[1:20:12] Israelites did till when he does appear
[1:20:15] in the last days in the Pentecostal age
[1:20:17] as the Holy Spirit they rejected it they
[1:20:21] did the same thing as Israel did
[1:20:25] okay
[1:20:29] now can you give me the the other slide
[1:20:32] to the last one now
[1:20:34] because I want us to come to
[1:20:38] okay
[1:20:39] now in seven Church edges
[1:20:42] we have established that he was in the
[1:20:45] office of the son of God
[1:20:49] until
[1:20:51] the age of laautitia when they rejected
[1:20:55] him now he went outside to the church
[1:20:59] but he's no King
[1:21:02] for the last one that is still out there
[1:21:06] if he can hit to their voice
[1:21:09] that is calling thank you brother hope
[1:21:13] you sung for us that Jesus is Calling
[1:21:15] he's pleading with you
[1:21:18] yeah
[1:21:19] you are in the church but you are not
[1:21:21] sure
[1:21:23] you have United with him
[1:21:25] you are not sure but this quickening
[1:21:28] power can work in you
[1:21:32] you have a chance
[1:21:35] you have a chance
[1:21:38] that the body is still on the massive
[1:21:40] City
[1:21:41] For What in the sitting for you
[1:21:44] when you do something that is wrong
[1:21:47] that is worthy a punishment
[1:21:50] the fullness of the godhead reportedly
[1:21:53] the father he looks at he looks at the
[1:21:56] body on The Mercy Seat
[1:21:58] and that's what happened the the
[1:22:00] quickening power or the fullness of the
[1:22:03] godhead
[1:22:05] bodily left the body on the massive seat
[1:22:09] and he sneaked out
[1:22:11] I'm going to explain because that is now
[1:22:14] the mystery that we read in the book of
[1:22:16] Colossians and that is where we have in
[1:22:20] the message Christ is the mystery of God
[1:22:23] revealed it is a sacred
[1:22:26] it is a mystery but this mystery has now
[1:22:30] been made known
[1:22:32] only to the bride
[1:22:36] let me explain that one
[1:22:41] you can be in the house
[1:22:42] we have visitors we have children
[1:22:46] and we have the father there
[1:22:48] he looks at the wife
[1:22:51] and the wife understands what he wants
[1:22:58] and she starts acting
[1:23:01] there was no communication
[1:23:04] [Laughter]
[1:23:05] but she understood
[1:23:08] what he meant
[1:23:10] it is only the pride who understands
[1:23:14] what the pride groom wants
[1:23:18] why when he up when the seven seal was
[1:23:23] opened there was silence in heaven but
[1:23:26] in the course of that silence the pride
[1:23:29] can understand what is the pride groom
[1:23:31] wants
[1:23:35] you can interpret what is the bridegroom
[1:23:38] wants so the practicum is communicating
[1:23:42] with the bride
[1:23:47] God help us
[1:23:50] okay
[1:23:54] now in the message Christ is the mystery
[1:23:56] of God revealed
[1:23:58] paragraph one or five the prophet says
[1:24:00] now God had a purpose in the hidden
[1:24:03] Mystery remember in the book of
[1:24:06] Colossians we said the mystery is the
[1:24:10] Christ
[1:24:11] the hope of glory
[1:24:14] Christ the hope of glory in you
[1:24:18] that was the great mystery now here the
[1:24:21] prophet saying God in his mind the back
[1:24:25] part of his mind he had a purpose that
[1:24:30] was divided into three mysteries
[1:24:35] so that mystery but out of these three
[1:24:39] mysteries let's now try to expound on
[1:24:42] those Mysteries so that now we see where
[1:24:45] we are the first one the prophet says
[1:24:48] God wanted to reveal himself
[1:24:51] now how was he going to reveal himself
[1:24:53] the fullness of the Court head bodily
[1:24:57] comes in the body and the two unite now
[1:25:01] Jesus Christ was walking here
[1:25:03] representing God
[1:25:07] so he unveiled himself he revealed
[1:25:11] himself that was the first grateful
[1:25:14] purpose that God wanted to fulfill
[1:25:19] then the second grateful purpose
[1:25:22] that he wanted to have preeminence in
[1:25:26] the body of believers now how is he
[1:25:29] going to achieve that
[1:25:34] for him to achieve that the
[1:25:38] quickening power
[1:25:40] or the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:25:44] now comes down
[1:25:47] as we have said it came down on Mount
[1:25:50] sunset
[1:25:52] for what
[1:25:53] we have preeminence in the body of
[1:25:57] believers
[1:26:00] can anyone can any one of us say that
[1:26:03] God has preeminence in me
[1:26:12] can you come to a point where you can
[1:26:14] say it is not I who liveth
[1:26:21] God help us
[1:26:27] that second fault purpose
[1:26:30] it's what is delaying the rapture
[1:26:36] we have never allowed him to have
[1:26:39] preeminence
[1:26:44] and he must achieve that
[1:26:47] God cannot fail
[1:26:49] he has to achieve that
[1:26:51] whether you fail or I fail somebody will
[1:26:54] fulfill it
[1:26:57] somebody will meet that requirement
[1:26:59] may God help me to be that one person
[1:27:05] may God help me to be that one person
[1:27:09] where God can have free eminence
[1:27:14] where I can say it is not I
[1:27:18] I cannot use my internet my anything no
[1:27:22] on everything I look at what the word
[1:27:25] says
[1:27:27] why because the word has preeminence in
[1:27:30] me
[1:27:32] may God help us
[1:27:35] so is the problem
[1:27:39] is this guy
[1:27:42] and that's why the prophet says the
[1:27:44] greatest enemy
[1:27:46] was pranham
[1:27:49] always standing between him and the god
[1:27:52] this flesh
[1:27:55] if we can die
[1:27:59] I I I wish I was able to sing that song
[1:28:01] he died to make men holy
[1:28:04] let us die to make men free
[1:28:07] if you can die you will save people free
[1:28:13] but in many times we are standing in the
[1:28:16] way
[1:28:18] God have mercy on us
[1:28:21] God have mercy on me
[1:28:24] I need to die
[1:28:27] I just need to die
[1:28:29] if I can die people will see Christ in
[1:28:31] me
[1:28:39] God help us
[1:28:42] so
[1:28:43] now from Seven Church ages
[1:28:46] he changed now
[1:28:50] to the ministry
[1:28:52] of the son of man
[1:28:55] and now we come to the bright age
[1:28:58] now we are in the bright age
[1:29:03] in the bright age he is operating in the
[1:29:06] office of the son of man
[1:29:09] now if he's operating in the office of
[1:29:12] the son of man what is remaining is to
[1:29:15] go to the Millennium where he will now
[1:29:17] change to the office of the son of David
[1:29:24] now
[1:29:26] in the son of man
[1:29:31] the bride was inside him
[1:29:37] in the sun in the seven Church ages the
[1:29:40] Holy Spirit he operated in the office of
[1:29:42] the Holy Spirit where he was dwelling in
[1:29:46] the hearts of men
[1:29:49] now in the Millennium it will be now the
[1:29:52] wife or the Queen Under The King both of
[1:29:56] them Seated on the throne
[1:30:01] the prophet says do we see how close we
[1:30:04] are
[1:30:08] how many beliefs were in the bright age
[1:30:16] still has a problem with us
[1:30:20] we are still looking back
[1:30:25] but the ministry has changed
[1:30:28] he has changed the form he has changed
[1:30:30] the office he is now operating in a
[1:30:32] different office let us move on
[1:30:36] let us move on
[1:30:39] let us recognize who we are now
[1:30:42] who are we
[1:30:44] the fullness of the godhead Pottery has
[1:30:47] come down to unite with the body
[1:30:54] for what purpose so that he can now
[1:30:57] fulfill the second faulty purpose that
[1:31:01] he had in the back part of his mind
[1:31:06] we are privileged people that we can go
[1:31:09] in the back part of the mind of God and
[1:31:12] see
[1:31:12] what he had before the foundation of the
[1:31:15] world
[1:31:17] may God help us
[1:31:20] may God have mercy on us it is later
[1:31:23] than we think
[1:31:25] so if there is anything you can do
[1:31:28] just lay aside every weight of sin
[1:31:31] any unbelief let us move on let us allow
[1:31:36] him to have preeminence
[1:31:40] because that second fold purpose until
[1:31:42] it is fulfilled we are going nowhere
[1:31:48] that may not be a hindrance
[1:31:52] if it means to die let me die
[1:31:57] so that Christ can be seen in me
[1:32:00] that is all that he's waiting for
[1:32:04] yes we can do all other things but until
[1:32:08] we allow him to have preeminence
[1:32:14] how so that in every situation
[1:32:18] it is him first
[1:32:23] can we
[1:32:27] can it happen
[1:32:30] do we see where the problem is
[1:32:34] that second for the purpose
[1:32:39] if we can allow it
[1:32:41] to be fulfilled
[1:32:43] but the prophet says it is later than we
[1:32:45] think do we see how late we are how late
[1:32:48] it is
[1:32:52] then if it is so late
[1:32:55] what we need to do
[1:32:57] let us surrender so that he can have
[1:32:59] preeminence
[1:33:03] let this word richly dwell in you
[1:33:11] allow him
[1:33:14] let's allow him
[1:33:23] oh my goodness
[1:33:25] God help us
[1:33:29] amen the prophet says in the same
[1:33:31] message he continues to say
[1:33:33] pipo has been in type
[1:33:36] and expressing what God's Great call is
[1:33:39] and now in this last day he has revealed
[1:33:43] it and shows it and the Court's help we
[1:33:47] will see it right here this morning what
[1:33:50] the Lord had in his mind all along
[1:33:55] is to be fulfilled today
[1:34:00] so can we say this day this scripture is
[1:34:04] fulfilled in me
[1:34:08] I don't know about my neighbor
[1:34:10] I don't know
[1:34:12] it is now me
[1:34:16] if there will be one
[1:34:19] let me be that one
[1:34:22] let me just be that one
[1:34:26] may God help us
[1:34:28] it is later than we think
[1:34:31] it's time to shake ourselves
[1:34:33] tinge ourselves and see how we are
[1:34:35] standing
[1:34:37] God help us
[1:34:42] I'll stop there if I continue like that
[1:34:44] I will have no many friends in our
[1:34:46] meetings
[1:34:49] so for the sake of having more friends I
[1:34:51] will stop there
[1:34:53] blessing in the resurrection morning
[1:34:56] we shall rise how many are sure they
[1:34:58] will write our rights
[1:35:02] only if that
[1:35:05] fullness of godhead bodily
[1:35:09] you have allowed that fullness
[1:35:13] let us stand musicians you can come
[1:35:17] in the resurrection morning we shall
[1:35:19] rise
[1:35:29] faster you can come
[1:35:36] in the resurrection morning when the
[1:35:41] Trump of culture sound we shall rise
[1:35:45] Hallelujah
[1:35:50] been the Saints we come rejoicing on our
[1:35:54] notice we ever be found we shall rise
[1:35:59] Hallelujah
[1:36:04] [Music]
[1:36:27] foreign
[1:36:29] I don't know that song
[1:36:32] but I can learn it
[1:36:34] but probably not tonight did you enjoy
[1:36:36] that tonight
[1:36:45] some of the words that were spoken we
[1:36:48] could say that was pretty hard words
[1:36:50] from Brother Gilbert
[1:36:53] or we could say those were beautiful
[1:36:54] words from God
[1:36:57] and if we say those are words from
[1:36:59] Brother Gilbert then I do believe we
[1:37:02] need to check that quickening power
[1:37:04] but if we can say those words were from
[1:37:07] God
[1:37:08] maybe to shake us I feel I want to shake
[1:37:12] have a little bit of a
[1:37:15] inward look
[1:37:18] I just couldn't help but think about one
[1:37:21] scripture as brother Gilbert was
[1:37:22] preaching tonight you know
[1:37:24] it's interesting some of the timelines
[1:37:27] that he was speaking about how
[1:37:29] you know there was a change from the Son
[1:37:31] of God Ministry to the son of man
[1:37:34] Ministry and that time changed in our
[1:37:39] generation
[1:37:40] when he preached the indictment when
[1:37:43] brother Branham preached the indictment
[1:37:44] for the second crucifixion of the Lord
[1:37:47] Jesus Christ that was a very significant
[1:37:50] change but it was only because they
[1:37:52] rejected the opening of the word which
[1:37:54] is what happened on Mount Sunset it
[1:37:56] wasn't a supernatural experience that we
[1:37:59] just have a picture of and and we call
[1:38:01] it something that's just just
[1:38:02] memorabilia about the message of the
[1:38:04] hour no no no that was the opening of
[1:38:07] the word that's what that was
[1:38:09] but you know out of Ephesians I just
[1:38:11] can't help but think about being
[1:38:12] positionally placed in our promised land
[1:38:15] in Christ Jesus
[1:38:16] in Ephesians chapter 3 verse 16 it says
[1:38:21] that he would Grant you according to the
[1:38:24] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[1:38:26] with might by his spirit in the inner
[1:38:29] man that Christ May dwell in your hearts
[1:38:31] by faith that ye being rooted and
[1:38:34] grounded in love
[1:38:36] may be able to comprehend he wants us to
[1:38:39] comprehend this he wants us to get this
[1:38:41] this isn't something that's mysterious
[1:38:43] and out there those people that have
[1:38:45] that quickening power able to say Amen
[1:38:48] we understand what happened on Sunset
[1:38:50] Mountain Verse 18 says may be able to
[1:38:52] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[1:38:54] breadth and length and depth and height
[1:38:57] and to know the love of Christ which
[1:38:59] passeth knowledge
[1:39:01] to be able to go beyond all that we
[1:39:04] think we know
[1:39:05] by faith being rooted and grounded in
[1:39:07] love in Christ
[1:39:09] which passeth knowledge that ye might be
[1:39:13] filled with all the fullness of God
[1:39:18] that you might be filled with all the
[1:39:20] fullness of God it's not something
[1:39:22] mysterious brother Gilbert was talking
[1:39:24] about tonight that the Lord was bringing
[1:39:25] to us brothers and sisters this is
[1:39:27] scripture we can say it this day this
[1:39:30] scripture is fulfilled in me I might not
[1:39:32] feel like it I might not look like it
[1:39:34] but his word says it and I say Amen to
[1:39:37] that that's the only thing that needs to
[1:39:39] happen Satan wants to say no you don't
[1:39:40] you you don't look like it no you you
[1:39:43] don't feel like it I know when I came to
[1:39:45] church before I came to church there was
[1:39:46] a dark cloud that tried to settle down
[1:39:48] on me I was talking to my wife about
[1:39:50] that I was talking to another brother
[1:39:52] about that and you know what wasn't just
[1:39:54] me but it's for a reason Satan doesn't
[1:39:56] want us to get this Revelation because
[1:39:58] when we get this Revelation we're going
[1:40:00] up and when we go up he's cast down
[1:40:05] he knows his time is short
[1:40:07] brothers and sisters when we go forwards
[1:40:09] maybe the words were hard tonight to
[1:40:11] think that maybe we need to do something
[1:40:13] the only thing we need to do is look
[1:40:15] away to Jesus don't look at our faults
[1:40:17] and failures don't worry about all of
[1:40:19] the things in this life that we worry
[1:40:21] about worry about being right with the
[1:40:23] Lord worry about having that quickening
[1:40:25] power worry about having the token and
[1:40:27] when the Devil comes to try and tell us
[1:40:29] that we failed and there's no hope just
[1:40:32] remember God doesn't look at you he
[1:40:34] doesn't look at me God only looks at the
[1:40:37] sacrifice
[1:40:38] that's the only thing he sees as long as
[1:40:42] Jesus is interceding for us the only
[1:40:44] thing he sees is what Jesus did Satan
[1:40:47] wants us to think it's what we've done
[1:40:48] we couldn't do it we can't die for our
[1:40:50] sins he already paid them
[1:40:52] all of them
[1:40:53] anyways tonight I just feel inspired
[1:40:56] certainly thankful for that I feel
[1:40:57] shaken up I want to die out to myself
[1:40:59] more I want more of Christ in me so that
[1:41:03] we can potentially find that last
[1:41:05] predestinated seed
[1:41:07] let's just bow a prayer tonight gracious
[1:41:09] Heavenly Father we thank you for
[1:41:11] speaking to us Lord thank you for coming
[1:41:13] by here Lord for using our brother Lord
[1:41:15] to just shake us up a little bit Lord to
[1:41:18] help us to not be comfortable not to be
[1:41:21] in a laodiceem condition Lord Jesus we
[1:41:24] know that time is short we know that
[1:41:26] it's later than we thank Father and we
[1:41:28] know that you have given us all that we
