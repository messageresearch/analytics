[1:28:15] church praise the Lord
[1:28:20] amen the next question is when will the
[1:28:23] two two
[1:28:25] prophets and the 144,000 Jews will be
[1:28:29] killed Daniel chapter
[1:28:32] 9:27 and he shall confirm the Covenant
[1:28:35] with many for one week seven years and
[1:28:40] in the midst of the week three and one
[1:28:42] half he shall cause the sacrifice and
[1:28:45] the oblation to
[1:28:47] cease and for the overspreading of
[1:28:50] abomination he shall make it desolate
[1:28:53] even until the
[1:28:55] consumation and that determined shall be
[1:28:58] poured upon the

[1:29:06] says and they shall have finished and
[1:29:09] when they shall have finished their
[1:29:12] testimony the Beast the Antichrist that
[1:29:14] ascended out of the bottomless pit shall
[1:29:17] make war against them and shall overcome
[1:29:21] them and kill them and their dead bodies
[1:29:25] shall lie in the street of the great
[1:29:27] city which is spiritually is called
[1:29:30] Sodom and Egypt where our where also our
[1:29:34] Lord was
[1:29:37] crucified and they of the people and
[1:29:39] Kindred and tongues and Nations shall
[1:29:41] see their dead bodies three days and a
[1:29:44] half and shall not suffer their dead
[1:29:47] bodies to be put in Graves see how cruel
[1:29:51] the word will be and they that dwell D
[1:29:54] upon the Earth shall rejoice over them
[1:29:57] and make Merry and shall send gifts one
[1:30:01] to another because these two prophets
[1:30:05] tormented
[1:30:07] them with
[1:30:09] plagues to be put that dwell on the
[1:30:13] earth and after three days and a half
[1:30:15] the spirit of life from God entered into
[1:30:18] them and they stood upon their feet and
[1:30:21] great fear fell upon them with saw them
[1:30:25] and they heard a great voice from Heaven
[1:30:27] saying unto them come up heeter and they
[1:30:30] ascended up
[1:30:32] Hallelujah that's the six Rapture up to
[1:30:35] heaven in a cloud and their enemies
[1:30:38] beheld them to God be praised to God be
[1:30:40] the glory
[1:30:42] amen now after the three and one half
[1:30:46] years tribulation the prophet of God
[1:30:48] said then the Antichrist turns on the
[1:30:52] Jews and and that is what the Bible
[1:30:55] calls Jacob's
[1:30:56] trouble if you read in the Holy Bible
[1:30:59] the Jacob's trouble comes after the
[1:31:01] great Revelation when the Antichrist
[1:31:04] begins to kill the two prophets and the
[1:31:08] 144,000 question and answer
[1:31:10] 1964 the church is ending and has
[1:31:14] blacked out the bride is called we have
[1:31:17] already entered into the tribulation
[1:31:19] period no no no no no I wish I could
[1:31:22] just have more time on that
[1:31:24] the
[1:31:25] bride when she is taken from the
[1:31:29] church then the church AIDS will
[1:31:33] cease Le leoda goes into chaos the bride
[1:31:39] goes to
[1:31:41] glory and the tribulation sets upon
[1:31:46] tribulation period sets in upon the
[1:31:49] sleeping virgin for how many years for
[1:31:52] three and a half years
[1:31:57] while while Israel is getting its
[1:32:03] prophecy then tribulation sets in upon
[1:32:09] Israel see they are not at the same time
[1:32:12] the tribulation or Jacob's trouble does
[1:32:15] not happen at the same time as the
[1:32:18] foolish virgins because the prophet of
[1:32:20] God said while there is tribulation to
[1:32:23] the foolish virgins the two prophets are
[1:32:27] preaching
[1:32:28] peacefully amen no plagues to the
[1:32:31] Israelites amen but they're just
[1:32:34] sounding the seven
[1:32:36] trumpets okay to call out the
[1:32:40] 144,000 Israelites amen I hope we can
[1:32:43] follow that from the message of the
[1:32:45] Prophet
[1:32:47] amen so the Jacob's trouble happened
[1:32:50] after the Great Tribulation
[1:32:55] and at that time shall Michael let's get
[1:32:57] Daniel 12th chapter of Daniel and at
[1:33:00] that time shall Michael who is Michael
[1:33:03] the prophet of God said Michael is
[1:33:06] Christ amen
[1:33:08] amen and you know who who that is shall
[1:33:12] stand up the great Prince which standeth
[1:33:16] for the children of thy people and there
[1:33:19] shall be a time of trouble what is it
[1:33:23] right after
[1:33:25] this
[1:33:27] tribulation see that's a Jacob trouble
[1:33:29] there brothers and sisters amen when the
[1:33:33] Antichrist the prophet of God said break
[1:33:35] his Covenant in the midst that's after 3
[1:33:37] and one years that's when he persecutes
[1:33:40] and kills the two prophets Moses and
[1:33:43] Elijah and the
[1:33:46] 144,000 praise the Lord amen I hope the
[1:33:49] holy spirit is is clear on these things
[1:33:52] my brothers amen
[1:33:54] all right and that will happen after the
[1:33:57] wedding ceremony in heaven question and
[1:34:01] answer
[1:34:03] 1964 even his wife was in the palace the
[1:34:07] type that the bride will be in the
[1:34:09] palace in glory at that
[1:34:13] time then Jesus makes himself known to
[1:34:18] the Jews after the wedding ceremony
[1:34:24] the three and a half years in Jacob's
[1:34:28] trouble that three and a half years the
[1:34:32] end of the 70th week of Daniel praise
[1:34:37] the Lord
[1:34:38] amen to God be the
[1:34:43] glory and the prophet of God
[1:34:46] said in the message 70th week of Daniel
[1:34:50] 1961 he said
[1:34:53] notice these two prophets what will they
[1:34:56] do it's Moses and
[1:34:58] Elijah that will rise on the scene they
[1:35:02] will tell those Jews their mistake and
[1:35:05] out of that Jewish bands that's there
[1:35:09] now to be 144,000 God will call by this
[1:35:15] prophets what is it the spirit of
[1:35:19] Elijah of this Gentile
[1:35:22] Church listen the spirit of
[1:35:25] Elijah will just from the Gentile church
[1:35:29] will just
[1:35:31] continue Hallelujah right into that
[1:35:34] Jewish Church go right on in and call
[1:35:40] Moses with them Hallelujah you see it
[1:35:43] and he will preach the same message of
[1:35:47] Pentecost to those Jews this same
[1:35:50] message amen amen
[1:35:54] will be preached to those 144,000 that
[1:35:57] they rejected the Messiah amen you see
[1:36:00] it it will be the same Pentecostal
[1:36:04] message that these Jews will preach
[1:36:07] right over to them and they will hate
[1:36:10] those Jews so bad till they killed
[1:36:13] them and they were hated by All
[1:36:17] Nations and in the mids of the week
[1:36:21] because that they had raised up a great
[1:36:24] powerful 144,000 they had the Holy Ghost
[1:36:28] and brother you talk about doing
[1:36:31] Miracles they did
[1:36:34] them they stopped the heavens and it did
[1:36:38] not rain in the days of their prophecy
[1:36:41] smoke the Earth with plags as of as they
[1:36:45] want to they give plags and everything
[1:36:49] else they'll give them Romans a hard way
[1:36:53] to go but finally they'll be killed our
[1:36:57] God is a terrible God when he is
[1:37:01] angered but remember that's
[1:37:04] over in the 70th week and the church is
[1:37:08] in glory amen the wedding supper is
[1:37:11] going on yes the 17th week this G goes
[1:37:16] on during the 70th week in threee in the
[1:37:20] tree in the middle of it he breaks
[1:37:23] because he he kills see after breaking
[1:37:25] the Covenant because he kills those two
[1:37:30] Pentecostal
[1:37:32] prophets blessed be the word of the Lord
[1:37:35] amen now who are these two prophets
[1:37:40] okay Revelation 11:4 these are the two
[1:37:43] olive
[1:37:44] trees and the two candlesticks standing
[1:37:47] before the god of the earth and who is
[1:37:49] the god of the earth Matthew
[1:37:52] 171-3 and after six days Jesus taketh
[1:37:55] Peter James and John his brother and
[1:37:57] bringeth them up into an high mountain
[1:38:01] apart and was
[1:38:04] transfigured before them and his face
[1:38:07] did shine as the sun and his reignment
[1:38:11] was white as the light and behold there
[1:38:15] appeared unto them
[1:38:17] Moses and Elijah talking with him who is
[1:38:22] the god of the Earth
[1:38:24] none other our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:38:27] Christ amen hallelujah and the two o of
[1:38:31] trees the two prophets standing beside
[1:38:33] him now there are many interpretation to
[1:38:37] Moses and Elijah to the denomination
[1:38:40] they said Moses and Elijah is the old
[1:38:43] and the New Testament that's what they
[1:38:46] believe it's not a person it's the old
[1:38:49] and the New Testament but we know that
[1:38:52] is wrong
[1:38:54] now even in this message there are many
[1:38:58] interpretation to Moses and Elijah they
[1:39:00] said that reading about what the prophet
[1:39:03] of God
[1:39:05] said about Moses and Elijah I would not
[1:39:07] want to add any of my thoughts here
[1:39:09] that's why all these quotations are
[1:39:12] compiled before you I don't want to add
[1:39:15] anything from my own thoughts because I
[1:39:18] believe that the Bible and the message
[1:39:21] of the hour can interpret itself
[1:39:23] you don't need to add to it you just
[1:39:26] have to have patience in reading and
[1:39:30] searching and praying for the leading of
[1:39:32] the Holy Spirit to bring these things to
[1:39:34] the people not your own thoughts I I
[1:39:37] don't want to add my own thoughts on
[1:39:39] anything of this my brothers and my
[1:39:40] sisters it's very
[1:39:43] dangerous for a preacher to put any
[1:39:47] interpretation to this
[1:39:50] amen and this is we know that the
[1:39:54] prophet said said this about Moses and
[1:39:56] Elijah hear ye him Peter got all excited
[1:40:00] the supernatural had been done there
[1:40:03] stood Moses and Elijah but been dead for
[1:40:09] years here they were standing
[1:40:12] alive standing there with Jesus
[1:40:15] witnesses to of the mightest prophets
[1:40:18] that ever walk on the earth standing by
[1:40:21] the side to watch God adopt his own
[1:40:28] son and another quotation question in
[1:40:31] answer
[1:40:32] 1957 okay the first one is
[1:40:35] 1958 the second one is
[1:40:38] 1957 the prophet said
[1:40:40] this and after a while down from heaven
[1:40:43] come one Chariot of fire and angels of
[1:40:45] fire horses of fire and Elijah stepped
[1:40:48] on and went up into Glory he never
[1:40:51] tested that he was
[1:40:56] translated then the prophet said he's
[1:40:58] got to
[1:40:59] die and then in paragraph
[1:41:03] 726 he said there stood both Moses and
[1:41:06] Elijah standing there talking to him
[1:41:09] certainly they did they're not dead they
[1:41:13] had never died they're Mortals they got
[1:41:15] to die that's what the prophet of God
[1:41:17] said there but in 19 in another
[1:41:20] quotation the prophet of God said here
[1:41:23] he was asked if the two prophets are
[1:41:26] literally Moses and Elijah or the Jews
[1:41:30] and this is what he said the six
[1:41:32] seal now here are these two prophets
[1:41:35] standing here with the word of God to do
[1:41:38] anything to Nature they want to and they
[1:41:42] shake the Earth and it shows exactly who
[1:41:44] does it it's Moses and
[1:41:48] Elijah
[1:41:50] re patterned again
[1:41:54] amen and in the six 1963 it's Moses and
[1:41:59] Elijah cuz there is there is their
[1:42:02] Ministry re
[1:42:06] impersonated it's both
[1:42:08] men and then in this one quote question
[1:42:12] and answer 1963 the prophet said this
[1:42:14] brother Bram it was
[1:42:16] asked if all of The Godly was taken up
[1:42:19] in the Rapture where will Elijah and
[1:42:21] Moses come from will they be Jews or
[1:42:24] will our Elijah given to us be with
[1:42:27] them he said the Gentile that will be
[1:42:32] Anointed with this Spirit to call out
[1:42:36] the Gentiles will be taken away because
[1:42:39] the whole church has been taken
[1:42:41] up these two
[1:42:43] prophets the 11th chapter is brought
[1:42:47] down and the day of Grace is ended with
[1:42:51] the Gentile
[1:42:53] and being sent to the
[1:42:55] Jews
[1:42:57] no it won't be the same man I'm pretty
[1:43:02] sure of that remember they're just the
[1:43:07] best of my knowledge see what the
[1:43:09] prophet said before that he said the
[1:43:12] spirit of Elijah that was on the
[1:43:14] Gentiles will move on
[1:43:17] Amen to the
[1:43:20] 144,000 amen so so I remain with this
[1:43:24] quotes of the Prophet because
[1:43:27] why
[1:43:29] because
[1:43:31] Elijah like Enoch has been translated to
[1:43:34] Heaven a long time ago
[1:43:37] amen and you cannot enter Heaven without
[1:43:40] being glorified because 1 Corinthians
[1:43:43] 15:50 says now this I say Brethren the
[1:43:47] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[1:43:50] kingdom of God neither do corruption
[1:43:54] inherit
[1:43:55] corruption see they have to be
[1:43:58] translated they have to be
[1:43:59] changed because flesh and
[1:44:02] blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of
[1:44:05] Heaven
[1:44:08] amen and again we know that the prophet
[1:44:12] that the Bible
[1:44:14] says here there are six raptures that
[1:44:18] happened amen about to happen the
[1:44:21] prophet of God said three rapture in the
[1:44:23] Old
[1:44:24] Testament and three
[1:44:27] Rapture on the New Testament the first
[1:44:30] Rapture is Enoch Genesis
[1:44:33] 5:24 the second Rapture is Elijah 2
[1:44:36] Kings 2:11 the third Rapture is Jesus
[1:44:39] Christ acts 1:9 now we have already had
[1:44:44] three raptures in the Old Testament did
[1:44:46] you know that Enoch was one Elijah was
[1:44:50] the other one and Jesus Hallelujah was
[1:44:54] the other one can we say Amen brothers
[1:44:56] and
[1:44:57] sisters and in the New
[1:45:00] Testament the first Rapture is Matthew
[1:45:03] 27:45 to 53 that's the Old Testament
[1:45:07] Church
[1:45:09] resurrected after our Lord raised from
[1:45:13] the dead
[1:45:14] amen and the prophet said that the New
[1:45:18] Testament 1 Thessalonians 4:12 to18 is
[1:45:21] the second Rapture of the New Testament
[1:45:23] amen and the third Rapture is revelation
[1:45:27] 111-12 the two prophets amen now there
[1:45:30] has been one Rapture already passed and
[1:45:33] that's Matthew 27 and the graves were
[1:45:36] open and many of the bodies of the
[1:45:38] saints that slept arose and came out of
[1:45:41] the graves after his resurrection and
[1:45:45] went into the holy city and appeared
[1:45:47] unto many one Rapture dis passed that's
[1:45:51] the Old Testament
[1:45:53] the second is fulfilled in 2
[1:45:56] Thessalonians 4 and that's our Rapture
[1:45:59] hallelujah amen and that's under the
[1:46:02] seven seal the opening Hallelujah of the
[1:46:07] word and the third the prophet of God
[1:46:10] said is revelation
[1:46:12] 11:11 amen there is your three raptures
[1:46:15] of the New Testament three raptures of
[1:46:19] the Old Testament all of them now okay
[1:46:23] okay passed but of course the Rapture of
[1:46:26] the church is we are waiting amen
[1:46:29] everybody say praise the Lord are you
[1:46:31] ready for the rupture of the church
[1:46:34] amen now the next question is who else
[1:46:38] is under the
[1:46:39] altar who
[1:46:41] else is under the
[1:46:46] altar this is what the prophet of God
[1:46:49] said Hebrews 1957
[1:46:54] just remember how many has died in each
[1:46:57] generation that has been Christians down
[1:47:00] through the age they're all
[1:47:03] resurrect that makes up the
[1:47:07] body you expect there be a 100 billion
[1:47:10] in this America come out or some other
[1:47:13] this world today there might not be 50
[1:47:16] come
[1:47:17] out but the great Ransom church is
[1:47:20] laying in the dust a waiting they are
[1:47:25] God's they are God's Jewel that's
[1:47:27] resting in the dust but their
[1:47:32] soul are under the altar of God Amen
[1:47:36] they are not in their right
[1:47:40] state they're in a body truly but a
[1:47:45] theop and they C cry out to God how long
[1:47:49] they could see one another but they
[1:47:52] could not shake each other's hands that
[1:47:55] kind of
[1:47:56] body
[1:48:00] amen I I I I believe the prophet's quote

[2:01:22] in Christ shall rise and that
[2:01:25] body that I once live in that theop

[2:02:22] one waiting we enter into that we'll

[2:02:35] body and we are now we are in a
[2:02:38] Celestial
[2:02:42] body body Hebrews chapter 6 again now
[2:02:46] when we go from here there's Tabernacle
[2:02:48] a theop just an image of a man that
[2:02:52] don't eat Don't drink don't sleep and
[2:02:55] awake forever that's what the prophet of
[2:02:57] God said that's how he defined and
[2:03:00] explain the theop and
[2:03:02] Celestial without adding my thoughts on
[2:03:05] it my brothers and my sisters because I
[2:03:07] believe the message is complete you
[2:03:09] don't have to interpret it let it
[2:03:11] interpret itself the Holy Ghost can
[2:03:14] interpret itself he doesn't need any man
[2:03:18] know to interpret the Holy Ghost can
[2:03:20] interpret by just the dailing the
[2:03:22] scriptures and the quotations there you
[2:03:25] go the revelation of the Prophet from
[2:03:27] God is given to the bride in these last
[2:03:29] days now the souls under the altar are
[2:03:32] they in their right State even though
[2:03:35] they are in theop even though they are
[2:03:37] in the heavenly bodies Hebrews chapter 4
[2:03:41] again the prophet of God said the the
[2:03:43] great ransome church is laying in the
[2:03:45] dust awaiting there are God's Jewels
[2:03:47] that's resting in the dust but their
[2:03:49] souls are under the

[2:04:01] Tate amen they are in a
[2:04:04] body truly but a theop and they cry out

[2:04:34] not all the Believers will die some of
[2:04:36] the Believers will be waiting here for a
[2:04:39] chance for the coming of the Lord
[2:04:43] amen but we are not scared to
[2:04:46] die to go under the souls on under the
[2:04:49] altar right amen and this is what the
[2:04:52] prophet of God said how long shall they
[2:04:55] stay in that
[2:04:56] body God perfect perfecting his church
[2:05:00] when a saint
[2:05:01] dies I'm not able to tell you what kind
[2:05:04] of a body he receives but it's not a
[2:05:09] glorified body it's not a spirit but
[2:05:12] it's some kind of a
[2:05:17] body that will last
[2:05:24] that will
[2:05:26] last until the
[2:05:31] resurrection amen it's a temporary
[2:05:35] body the first one that we have read
[2:05:37] from the message of the Prophet it will
[2:05:40] last until the
[2:05:44] resurrection and that body is not
[2:05:47] complete according to the
[2:05:49] prophet God's only provided place of
[2:05:51] worship
[2:05:53] 1965 amen and there's one body here then
[2:05:58] that body
[2:06:00] there which is the celestial
[2:06:03] body amen the open Celestial and then

[2:06:22] that makes it
[2:06:25] complete amen it's a temporal
[2:06:29] body that will last until the
[2:06:31] resurrection then it will become
[2:06:34] complete when it picks up the glorified
[2:06:37] body in the resurrection everybody say
[2:06:39] praise the Lord brothers and
[2:06:40] sisters and the prophet of God in
[2:06:43] another
[2:06:44] message in the question and answer 1953
[2:06:47] he said see Let Me continue let me go
[2:06:51] Direct to that paragraph
[2:06:53] 87 but now here's the Glorious part
[2:06:57] hallelujah amen on the return of Jesus
[2:07:02] at the
[2:07:03] resurrection it won't be that
[2:07:07] body that body then that supernatural
[2:07:11] being that God created in the beginning
[2:07:14] that will return to the Earth to get a
[2:07:20] another body

[2:08:09] made for
[2:08:11] heaven
[2:08:13] hallelujah amen we were made for Earth
[2:08:19] we are Earth people
[2:08:22] do you remember in the Bible Souls under
[2:08:24] the altar

[2:08:31] body shake hands with another hand and
[2:08:35] eat and
[2:08:36] fellowship that's what we were
[2:08:39] made that's how what we were made for
[2:08:44] hallelujah amen W it made for heavens we
[2:08:48] are made for Earth our soul
[2:08:51] is from heaven but our body it came from
[2:08:55] the

[2:09:08] hallelujah we were not going to stay in
[2:09:11] heaven we are going to stay here Amen
[2:09:15] Let It Be The Name Of The Lord so we was
[2:09:18] not made for heaven and that part of
[2:09:19] that body that's what the prophet of God
[2:09:22] said amen making a way someday he will
[2:09:27] rise Hallelujah in that Corporal body he
[2:09:32] will rise my brothers and my sisters
[2:09:37] amen he will rise in that Corporal
[2:09:41] body and when he returns back this
[2:09:45] celestial
[2:09:46] bodies which were under the

[2:09:55] him and we will live forever in that
[2:09:59] body amen
[2:10:01] hallelujah hear his voice
[2:10:04] 1958 but then when that body kind of
[2:10:08] celestial body when it returns back to
[2:10:10] Earth it picks up the substance that it
[2:10:13] once lived then it becomes a glorified
[2:10:17] body and that body Hallelujah is is the
[2:10:21] one that we will see our lord Jesus in

[2:12:53] word when the
[2:12:55] theop becomes Immortal flesh
[2:13:00] again like it was in the
[2:13:07] beginning what
[2:13:10] beginning when was this
[2:13:13] beginning when we had this Immortal
[2:13:18] body brothers and sisters

[2:13:44] and these people down here on Earth we
[2:13:48] are waiting for that Corporal body
[2:13:51] to stand but the prophet of God said it
[2:13:54] will not stand there it will wait for
[2:13:57] the last name to be called to be washed
[2:14:01] by the blood to receive the baptism of
[2:14:03] the Holy Ghost then we can all go to the
[2:14:06] Rapture you see and that's why and
[2:14:09] that's why we need to go out and preach
[2:14:13] the gospel to all the world because
[2:14:16] that's how the Lord will call that last
[2:14:20] name
[2:14:22] amen and the prophet of God said if you
[2:14:23] can go because you're so busy amen you
[2:14:27] know what he said there
[2:14:30] amen
[2:14:32] hallelujah you can go send somebody amen
[2:14:36] amen somebody that will look for the
[2:14:39] soul not to make their pocket
[2:14:43] fat because of your
[2:14:46] support and to make them themselves
[2:14:48] rich and above all the rest of the
[2:14:52] ministers
[2:14:54] no
[2:14:56] amen sometimes we have to be careful
[2:14:58] with our money brothers and sisters
[2:15:01] amen
[2:15:03] hallelujah make sure it's going to the
[2:15:06] lost
[2:15:07] souls and that's going to the wallet and
[2:15:10] the
[2:15:11] pocket of the people who enrich
[2:15:14] themselves

[2:15:27] my brothers and sisters amen thank you
[2:15:29] for your
[2:15:31] patience
[2:15:33] now what is really AR theophany this is
[2:15:37] one of the question has been lingering
[2:15:39] in the minds of many ministers and
[2:15:41] members as well this really AR
[2:15:43] theop now you will be
[2:15:46] surprised when you read this Co more
[2:15:49] prophet teaching clearly what is the
[2:15:53] opening
[2:15:55] okay prophet of God
[2:15:58] said
[2:16:05] okay let me go to this when God made man
[2:16:09] he made him
[2:16:10] aop in the message Hebrews question
[2:16:14] answers on Hebrews part 3 1957 God help
[2:16:18] us
[2:16:19] please continue your focus to this it is
[2:16:22] very important my brothers and sisters
[2:16:25] on this part of the message it's very
[2:16:27] important to really focus your attention
[2:16:31] here CU there's so much misunderstanding
[2:16:33] about the theop now in this message but
[2:16:36] we don't want to interpret anything we
[2:16:38] just want the prophet speak for itself
[2:16:40] the word of God
[2:16:42] Amen and this is what the prophet of God
[2:16:47] said
[2:16:49] paragraph 8:22 when he the logos went
[2:16:52] out of God which was God coming from
[2:16:56] this one big Fountain into a body in the
[2:17:00] form of a man and it made the
[2:17:04] logos which we call
[2:17:07] theop okay so God the spirit has a
[2:17:11] body and it's a the prophet of God said
[2:17:14] it is a form of a man logos theop
[2:17:19] amen paragraph 824 if you take the
[2:17:23] theophany when you're looking at that
[2:17:26] that's a
[2:17:28] man
[2:17:29] see that's what we were in the
[2:17:34] beginning okay now you do not understand
[2:17:37] it now but you was back there in the
[2:17:40] beginning that
[2:17:42] way when God made Man In His
[2:17:46] Image he made him a theop
[2:17:52] and he only placed him in
[2:17:56] flesh when God made Man In His Image in
[2:18:00] his likeness Genesis 2 or Genesis 1 128
[2:18:03] I believe there was no man yet to till
[2:18:07] the
[2:18:08] soil and
[2:18:10] God had done made male and
[2:18:15] female that's right no man to te the
[2:18:17] soil amen amen see
[2:18:22] 825 then God brought man a little
[2:18:27] lower and put him in animal life that's
[2:18:32] this
[2:18:33] body
[2:18:38] amen just like the animals so that he
[2:18:40] could till the soil could
[2:18:45] touch that theop doesn't
[2:18:49] touch he
[2:18:51] doesn't see taste smell and hear the
[2:18:54] senses that we have so God put man down
[2:19:00] there to touch and to
[2:19:03] F
[2:19:04] amen see the combination of the
[2:19:08] theophany and the body Genesis 1:28
[2:19:12] 26-28 and Genesis 2:7 God for man from
[2:19:16] the dust of the
[2:19:18] earth 826
[2:19:21] now listen to this church please
[2:19:24] amen and he walked through the Garden of
[2:19:31] Eden
[2:19:33] first as a
[2:19:37] Theo like the holy spirit is in here now
[2:19:40] walking in here it led the animal life
[2:19:43] it controlled everything but it could
[2:19:46] not till the
[2:19:48] soil see theop walking in the
[2:19:52] Garden but it could not till the soil so
[2:19:55] what God did to the
[2:19:57] theop
[2:19:59] amen are you still there brothers and
[2:20:01] sisters thank you so God put him in
[2:20:07] flesh what did he what did he put in
[2:20:09] flesh that the he put him in flesh so
[2:20:14] that he could tell the
[2:20:17] soil give him five senses to till the
[2:20:21] soil The Vineyards and so
[2:20:24] forth and the man still look
[2:20:27] Lonesome oh this is a beautiful picture
[2:20:30] paragraph 8-7 notice
[2:20:34] now when he first made he made two
[2:20:37] people together he was made both male
[2:20:40] and female that man was the Bible said
[2:20:42] he was God made both male and female he
[2:20:45] created he him notice now when man was
[2:20:49] separated
[2:20:51] from the theop and put in
[2:20:54] flesh he was not just allog together
[2:20:58] there part of his being was still at the
[2:21:07] open but it did not look
[2:21:11] right part of his being was still a
[2:21:16] theop but it did not look right the
[2:21:20] prophet of God
[2:21:21] said that's why that's why he put him in
[2:21:24] the flesh not
[2:21:26] theop he
[2:21:28] said
[2:21:30] okay
[2:21:33] right let me go to paragraph 8:30 now my
[2:21:36] brothers see she was part of him in the
[2:21:40] beginning in the
[2:21:42] creation in
[2:21:46] aop she was part down here in this
[2:21:49] creation she could not be divided in
[2:21:52] other creation she had to be made in the
[2:21:54] same
[2:21:55] creation okay and
[2:21:58] paragraph now let's let's let let us go
[2:22:01] to this next quotation here this is
[2:22:04] going to shock some of us if not all
[2:22:08] Hebrews chapter 2
[2:22:11] 1957 okay let me go back go down to the
[2:22:17] yellow to the last paragraph
[2:22:22] then God made man out of Out of the Dust
[2:22:24] of the earth now okay let me go let me
[2:22:27] read it here in to paragraph 278 to
[2:22:30] complete now the
[2:22:31] logos that went out of God the logos all
[2:22:36] this begin to form into a body shape and
[2:22:40] this body shape was called in the
[2:22:42] scholar
[2:22:44] logos
[2:22:45] theop that went out of God in other
[2:22:48] words a better word for it it was what
[2:22:51] we call a
[2:22:54] theop now close
[2:22:57] parenthesis
[2:23:00] theop is a human
[2:23:05] body that's
[2:23:06] glorified that is the complete
[2:23:09] theophany amen theophany alone soul and
[2:23:14] Celestial is not complete it has to have
[2:23:17] a glorified body amen and when we pick
[2:23:21] up that glorified body the prophet of
[2:23:24] God said
[2:23:26] Hallelujah the is a human body that's
[2:23:31] been
[2:23:33] glorified
[2:23:36] amen that is what the prophet of God and
[2:23:38] this last paragraph
[2:23:40] says amen
[2:23:43] hallelujah but the difference between an
[2:23:46] animal and a
[2:23:47] man God put put a soul in a
[2:23:53] man and he did not put it in the
[2:23:58] animal because the
[2:24:05] soul that was in the
[2:24:10] man is that
[2:24:12] theophany youbody say praise the
[2:24:14] Lord
[2:24:16] see what is our theop our soul that so
[2:24:20] when we die this soul that the prophet
[2:24:23] of God called will go directly to the
[2:24:25] souls Under The Altar and wait for that
[2:24:29] Celestial body for a while until the
[2:24:33] resurrection a theop without the spirit
[2:24:36] a theop the prophet of God said not
[2:24:39] complete a
[2:24:41] theop that you cannot shake your hands
[2:24:45] and it waits for the
[2:24:46] resurrection that's why the prophet of
[2:24:48] God said theop
[2:24:51] is a human body
[2:24:52] Hallelujah that's glorified that's the
[2:24:56] complete the body that God has planned
[2:25:00] before the foundation of the world my
[2:25:02] brothers and my sisters amen
[2:25:05] hallelujah and notice the prophet of God
[2:25:08] said before we
[2:25:09] close
[2:25:12] amen prophet of God said before we close
[2:25:15] we bypass our theop that's right many of
[2:25:18] us know that quote but
[2:25:20] we must interpret that cot not with our
[2:25:23] own intelligence but with what the
[2:25:25] prophet of God said because you can get
[2:25:28] wrong because some people are thinking
[2:25:31] that we left your te open in
[2:25:35] heaven be careful of that my brothers
[2:25:37] and sisters let's follow the teaching of
[2:25:40] the Holy Ghost in the
[2:25:41] prophet God said when God he created man
[2:25:44] he did the soul and that soul in that
[2:25:48] man is is the opening
[2:25:51] amen so when we die that soul is
[2:25:54] released and temporarily waits in Souls
[2:25:57] under the Elder it's not complete it's
[2:26:00] going to wait for his glorified body
[2:26:03] before he can become complete to open
[2:26:05] open now the prophet of God said we
[2:26:08] bypass our theop let's let's read
[2:26:10] that see who is this milk
[2:26:14] acidic you see come right regular before
[2:26:17] the foundation of the world his name is
[2:26:19] put on the Lambs Book of Life he become
[2:26:22] the word the
[2:26:24] theop what kind of
[2:26:26] theop that could
[2:26:28] appear and disappear see that's theop
[2:26:32] body of God it could appear and
[2:26:36] disappear amen that's the body that's
[2:26:40] the theop the prophet is talking about
[2:26:44] the theop body that could
[2:26:46] appear and
[2:26:48] disappear amen but what did the prophet
[2:26:51] of God said he became the word that
[2:26:53] theop that could appear and disappear
[2:26:57] amen then he become flesh and returned
[2:26:59] back again resurrected in the same body
[2:27:01] in a glorified condition but you bypass
[2:27:03] that theophany that kind of body that
[2:27:05] could appear and disappear you become
[2:27:07] pleased man to be
[2:27:10] tempted by
[2:27:12] sin see we bypass that kind of body that
[2:27:19] could appear in this
[2:27:21] the prophet of God
[2:27:22] said we came directly into flesh like
[2:27:26] Adam everybody can follow that right and
[2:27:29] this is what the prophet of God said
[2:27:32] what is theop body he said theop it's
[2:27:35] called a word
[2:27:37] body this then is the state he was in
[2:27:40] when he made
[2:27:42] Abraham was called
[2:27:44] mesc he was in the form of theop see
[2:27:49] theop
[2:27:50] is not complete without a body a form
[2:27:56] and that's why God showed
[2:27:59] himself to
[2:28:01] Abraham in a theop body visible physical
[2:28:07] tangible that's what we
[2:28:10] bypass prophet of God we went directly
[2:28:12] to flesh can you say can we follow that
[2:28:16] amen
[2:28:17] now
[2:28:19] see God is Not Without a body God has a
[2:28:22] body it looks like a man in to men see
[2:28:27] so the prophet of God said he had a body
[2:28:29] he was B father Holy Ghost and dwelt in
[2:28:31] human form the theop of God the great
[2:28:34] image of God that he made man then he
[2:28:36] plac him in the earth he had a body God
[2:28:40] is Not Without a body God has got a body
[2:28:43] and it looks like a
[2:28:45] man see that brothers and sisters when
[2:28:48] you talk about theop you don't talk
[2:28:50] about the soul only you talk about the
[2:28:52] physical form of
[2:28:55] God showing himself and he could appear
[2:28:58] and disappear at the same time if he
[2:29:00] wants see the prophet of God that's what
[2:29:03] we
[2:29:04] bypassed we went directly into
[2:29:07] flesh the prophet of God called the
[2:29:10] spirit and the soul of Jesus Christ
[2:29:12] theop inment his soul his Spirit his
[2:29:16] theop of his own being went down to hell
[2:29:19] but his body was
[2:29:22] left in the grave right but his soul his
[2:29:26] Spirit his theop see God called that
[2:29:30] theop the spirit and the soul of Jesus
[2:29:32] Christ that
[2:29:34] went to hell but the body was still
[2:29:37] laying on the grave see you see
[2:29:40] understand that the open it is the
[2:29:42] spirit and the soul and the
[2:29:45] combination of a glorified body that's
[2:29:49] the complete re reation of theop
[2:29:51] brothers and sisters
[2:29:53] amen hallelujah and the prophet of God
[2:29:55] called that word form body
[2:29:59] theop he said we have not yet entered
[2:30:04] into that word form
[2:30:06] body amen but a
[2:30:09] theop see we are a theop but we have not
[2:30:12] yet entered into that word form
[2:30:15] body okay but you see in order to stand
[2:30:18] Temptation you had to byass that theop
[2:30:21] that body see you had to come down here
[2:30:24] in flesh to be tempted by
[2:30:27] sin then the prophet of God
[2:30:31] said then from that paragraph 770 he
[2:30:35] became the word the theophany that could
[2:30:37] appear and disappear and then he become
[2:30:40] flesh and returned back again
[2:30:42] resurrected that same body in a
[2:30:44] glorified condition but you bypass the
[2:30:48] theop and become man to be tempted by
[2:30:51] sin we have not yet that bodies we have
[2:30:55] not yet entered the word form
[2:30:57] see so the prophet of God
[2:31:01] said how that theop is formed now

[2:34:25] was he see prophet of God

[2:35:36] perfect spoken
[2:35:38] word and a spoken word cannot
[2:35:41] sin
[2:35:46] see one time they was not that way
[2:35:50] where did Adam fell Adam fell from
[2:35:52] eternal life then when Nature and people
[2:35:55] the Bible says are groaning they're not
[2:35:57] in their ought to be condition see they
[2:36:01] haven't fallen they have fallen from
[2:36:03] somewhere now we don't need anybody to
[2:36:05] interpret that for us we know it was
[2:36:08] eternal life they had fallen from and
[2:36:10] they lost their claims of eternal life
[2:36:13] by the fall of Adam and Eve who fell
[2:36:15] from eternal life to
[2:36:17] death in the Garden of Eden and brought
[2:36:20] all nature under them to
[2:36:22] death a tree never died before Adam an
[2:36:26] animal would not die before Adam he was
[2:36:30] given premoral agency he was given to
[2:36:34] them amen you see that's what the
[2:36:37] prophet of God
[2:36:40] said amen and the prophet of God said he
[2:36:44] could control the
[2:36:47] nature amen amen he said Adam could say
[2:36:50] to this mountain move there and it would
[2:36:53] Adam could say let this tree be pled and
[2:36:55] planted over it would do it for he had
[2:36:57] complete Supreme control as a minor God
[2:37:01] under our god what happened to the body
[2:37:04] of Adam that cannot die after he sin
[2:37:07] this is what the prophet of God Jesus
[2:37:08] Christ the same yesterday today and
[2:37:10] forever but sin after the fall blinded
[2:37:14] every fiber in his body his mind his
[2:37:18] heart but now don't never try to study
[2:37:21] it out you cannot figure it out see
[2:37:24] prophet of God said it blinded the whole
[2:37:28] body of
[2:37:29] Adam amen it blinded everything after he
[2:37:34] become he become unconscious because of
[2:37:37] the sin all of his great channels clug
[2:37:41] up now through the fall he lost that
[2:37:44] power he become unconscious of the fact
[2:37:47] after losing his relationship and
[2:37:50] friendship fellowship with the father
[2:37:52] then he lost that and all of his great
[2:37:56] channels become clug up and he could not
[2:38:00] get through that's what happened to the
[2:38:02] body of Adam it's not supposed to
[2:38:05] die but because of sin all his great
[2:38:09] channels of
[2:38:11] God were clug
[2:38:13] up and the prophet of God said that's
[2:38:16] what clogging us also this day
[2:38:21] the teachings of denomination the Creeds
[2:38:23] and dogmas and our worries about this
[2:38:25] life is clogging the channels of God
[2:38:28] within
[2:38:31] us and the prophet of God said if the
[2:38:35] devil can work
[2:38:38] mightily in a person under his
[2:38:42] possession how much more God can work if
[2:38:46] he could find one man and a woman
[2:38:49] that would let the chel of the holy
[2:38:52] spirit in his whole body God can do many
[2:38:57] wondrous Miracles brothers and sisters

[2:44:55] you hear from your theophonic
[2:44:57] [Music]
[2:45:05] [Music]
[2:45:19] thought and Revelation for us to come to
[2:45:22] in our minds and our hearts to recognize
[2:45:26] that this flesh will never see where
[2:45:29] we're going this flesh is a part of this
[2:45:32] corrupt Earth and this flesh will remain
[2:45:35] here in this earth only in corruption
[2:45:40] will go to the other
[2:45:42] side but when the
[2:45:44] incorruption our soul goes to meet with
[2:45:48] our the
[2:45:50] bodies then we have the perfected body
[2:45:53] it's a tremendous thing I I just really
[2:45:55] enjoyed the thought that right now we
[2:45:57] are forming that word image body we just
[2:46:01] need to unclog the
[2:46:02] channels and you know what's the best
[2:46:04] way to unclog the channels brothers and
[2:46:06] sisters just go on our knees and speak
[2:46:09] to the Lord but we can allow the things
[2:46:12] in this life to become too busy to give
[2:46:15] us the opportunity to do that I'm
[2:46:17] preaching to myself here here remember
[2:46:20] the prayer meeting on the 7th come
[2:46:22] unclog the
[2:46:24] channels we just uh want to remind
[2:46:27] everyone we have a baptism this morning
[2:46:29] this afternoon a real special day sister
[2:46:32] Linda kabanda has the Revelation that
[2:46:36] it's her time to be baptized to be
[2:46:38] identified in a watery grave and we know
[2:46:41] this is the very first step to seeing
[2:46:44] that word image body form in our lives
[2:46:48] amen and we know that this is not where
[2:46:50] the battle stops this is merely where
[2:46:52] the battle
[2:46:53] starts but we know that he will actually
[2:46:57] guard us that he will look after us how
[2:46:59] many are going to pray for sister Linda
[2:47:01] kabanda today after she gets baptized
[2:47:05] and the days coming forward the devil
[2:47:06] doesn't want her to go on to receive the
[2:47:09] Holy Ghost we're so thankful that she
[2:47:11] wants to work on that word image body
[2:47:14] here let's just bow in a word of prayer
[2:47:16] as we close the service
[2:47:19] gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we
[2:47:21] thank you for the words we heard today
[2:47:24] Lord I believe that we did hear from our
[2:47:26] theophany bodies Hallelujah Lord it's
[2:47:28] important for us to recognize who we are
[2:47:31] and where we stand and Lord we we thank
[2:47:35] you Father that you have created us in
[2:47:37] your image and Lord you gave us the
[2:47:40] opportunity to bypass our theophanies
[2:47:43] Lord that we could come to Earth to be
[2:47:45] tried and to be tested to be born in sin
[2:47:48] shaped in iniquity it and come into this
[2:47:50] world speaking lies in this hybrid
[2:47:52] condition father but Lord nothing could
[2:47:55] change that Gene that you put inside of
[2:47:58] us from before the foundation of the
[2:47:59] world and Lord when we hear this word it
[2:48:02] causes something to LEAP inside our womb
[2:48:06] and father there's a life that Springs
[2:48:07] forward and that life the only form of
[2:48:12] incorruptable life is your very life
[2:48:15] Lord Jesus and that's what Springs to
[2:48:17] life inside of us we thank you you for
[2:48:19] that Lord thank you for our theophany
[2:48:21] bodies thank you for the ability to rise
[2:48:24] above all of the sin and the corruption

[2:48:59] that you would go with us as we go
[2:49:01] forwards with the baptism for sister
[2:49:03] Linda kabanda father that you would just
[2:49:05] bless her abundantly Lord that you would
[2:49:07] just push back the powers of Darkness
[2:49:09] father and allow her to have just a real
[2:49:12] relationship with you father like she's
[2:49:14] never experienced Lord father we love
