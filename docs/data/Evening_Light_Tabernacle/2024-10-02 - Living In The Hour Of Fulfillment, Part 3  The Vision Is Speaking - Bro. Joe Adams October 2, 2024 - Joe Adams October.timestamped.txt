[37:20] continues to do what he is he still is
[37:23] or what he was he is what he did he
[37:25] still does proven that Jesus Christ is
[37:28] the same yesterday today and forever and
[37:31] if he was faithful yesterday then we
[37:33] will find him faithful today we will
[37:35] find him faithful tomorrow in the last
[37:37] service we spoke on under the cover of
[37:40] darkness and we brought out how that the
[37:42] end time conditions would be of the
[37:45] world the condition of the world at the
[37:46] end time how Darkness will cover the
[37:48] Earth but gross Darkness to people and
[37:51] we find that it's in that darkness that
[37:53] deception takes place and we spoke about
[37:55] the boycott and the image of the Beast
[37:57] and how all the churches will be
[37:59] gathered into the World Council of
[38:00] churches and everything that will
[38:02] transpire at that time but tonight I
[38:04] want to speak to you on that the vision
[38:07] is speaking yes sir the vision is
[38:10] speaking amen habc 2 we find again I
[38:13] want to read it habca 2 and verse three
[38:15] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[38:17] time but at the end it shall speak yes
[38:21] this is a prophetic scripture here look
[38:24] we're living in the day where the we're
[38:26] living in the hour of fulfillment and
[38:29] the vision is speaking we're not waiting
[38:31] for it to speak we're watching the
[38:33] prophecies manifest in front of our eyes
[38:36] day after day week after week month
[38:39] after month we are seeing prophetic
[38:41] scriptures being made manifest right in
[38:44] front of our eyes that's right so we
[38:47] look here this word speak means to break
[38:49] out or Break Forth breathe out to come
[38:51] to pass and we understand that the
[38:53] vision is yet for an appointed time but
[38:55] at the end it shall bring forth right
[38:59] all right at the appointed time that God
[39:02] has allotted that this vision is going
[39:04] to speak or is going to manifest and and
[39:07] we find here don't be disappointed by a
[39:10] lack of expectation maybe you've never
[39:12] kept up with the news you never kept up
[39:14] with what's going on the in today in
[39:16] World politics and and what's going on
[39:18] in overseas and Israel but notice now I
[39:21] want you to understand prophecies are
[39:23] beginning to be made manifest even as of
[39:26] yesterday we find Iran attacked Israel
[39:29] and we find the scriptures regarding
[39:31] Israel that she would become a
[39:33] burdensome stone is being made manifest
[39:36] daily you recognize that her borderers
[39:39] she surrounded on every border by her
[39:42] enemy and yet she's still living let me
[39:46] tell you you're surrounded by your enemy
[39:48] and yet you're still living the bride of
[39:50] Christ is being attacked day after day
[39:53] after day the enemy is dropping bombs
[39:55] after bombs missile attack after missile
[39:58] attack mind battle after mind battle but
[40:01] little bride you're still here you're
[40:03] still living you're still overcoming and
[40:05] that which was spoken of Israel as the
[40:08] the natural bride is also speaks of you
[40:10] as the spiritual bride right the spirit
[40:13] and the voice of God is saying come and
[40:16] what is it doing it's manifesting the
[40:18] word of God for this
[40:20] hour now I'm going to try to slow down
[40:22] and teach a little bit of this tonight
[40:23] but I'm just a little bit caught up with
[40:25] it we look here in Daniel Daniel Daniel
[40:28] 9 and understand when I was gone brother
[40:30] Tim did a phenomenal job of picking this
[40:32] up and running with it I'm not going to
[40:34] do that kind of job tonight so I'm not
[40:36] going to disappoint you but I'm going to
[40:37] go into some other topics and maybe not
[40:39] quite like he did but we're a team so it
[40:42] it does US good to have some of this
[40:44] stuff reiterated to us but we find in
[40:46] Daniel 9 verse1 it says in the first
[40:48] year of Darius the son of
[40:51] azerus however you say that excuse me
[40:53] I'm not a theologian the seed of the
[40:56] mees which was made King over the realm
[40:58] of the Chans in the first year of his
[41:01] Reign I Daniel understood by books the
[41:04] number of years whereof the word of the
[41:06] Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that
[41:09] he would accomplish 70 years in the
[41:12] desolations of Israel so we find Daniel
[41:15] begin to look back at the writings of
[41:17] Jeremiah to gain understanding in
[41:20] regards to those 70 years when will this
[41:25] be
[41:25] accomplished what will be the manif he's
[41:28] looking to find when that time comes
[41:30] notice just think about it like this
[41:33] Daniel in his day was looking for modern
[41:35] events to be made clear by the prophecy
[41:37] of
[41:37] Jeremiah come on
[41:39] church and we can learn and many
[41:42] prophets they will look back at the
[41:44] writings or the the the scriptures from
[41:46] the pre their predecessors and they
[41:48] would see what they prophesied and
[41:51] notice one Prophet can't prophesy
[41:53] something contrary to another and can be
[41:56] a God's a god called prophet he must his
[41:59] his prophecies must line up and we find
[42:02] Daniel looking back to what Jeremiah
[42:06] said so what brother Joe what did
[42:08] Jeremiah say we go to Jeremiah 25 and
[42:11] verse 7 I know I'm going a little bit
[42:14] fast I got a lot of ground to cover but
[42:15] I will slow down at some
[42:17] point Jeremiah 25 and: 7 yet you have
[42:21] not hearken unto me sayeth the Lord that
[42:24] you might provoke me to anger with the
[42:26] works of your hand hands to your own
[42:28] hurt therefore thus sayith the Lord of
[42:30] hosts because you have not heard my
[42:32] words notice the key element here you
[42:35] have not heard my words Behold I will
[42:38] send and take all the families of the
[42:40] north sayeth the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar
[42:42] the king of Babylon my servant and will
[42:45] bring them against the land and against
[42:47] the inhabitants thereof and against all
[42:49] these nations round about and will
[42:51] utterly destroy them and make them an
[42:53] astonishment and a hissing and a
[42:56] Perpetual desolation
[42:57] moreover I will take from them the voice
[43:00] of merth and the voice of gladness the
[43:02] voice of the bridegroom the voice of the
[43:04] Bride the sounds of the millstones in
[43:07] the light of the candle and this whole
[43:09] land shall be a
[43:12] desolation and an astonishment and these
[43:15] nations Shall Serve the king of Babylon
[43:18] 70
[43:20] years and it shall come to pass when 70
[43:23] years are accomplished that I will
[43:25] punish the king of Babylon and that
[43:27] Nation saith the Lord for their iniquity
[43:29] and the land of the Chans will I make it
[43:32] a Perpetual desolation go to verse 10
[43:35] for thus sayeth the Lord that after 70
[43:37] years be accomplished at Babylon I will
[43:40] visit you and I will perform my good
[43:42] word toward you in causing you to return
[43:46] to this place so Daniel is looking back
[43:49] to Jeremiah to gain understanding of
[43:53] when will this happen will when the
[43:56] destruction of Nebuchadnezzar and the
[43:58] Babylonian Empire be made manifest but
[44:01] not only the destruction he's more
[44:04] concerned about when will Israel return
[44:07] back to our
[44:08] homeland so we find now Israel's been
[44:11] exiled taken captive by Babylonian or
[44:14] the B Babylonians in Nebuchadnezzar due
[44:17] to their Disobedience to God that's
[44:20] right you have not hearkened unto me
[44:23] sayeth the Lord that you might provoke
[44:24] me to anger with your works and your
[44:26] hands so we find their Disobedience
[44:29] provoked God so God scattered them God
[44:34] God s another Nation to come and to
[44:37] overtake them and bring them captive and
[44:39] make them slaves but I want you to
[44:41] understand here in verse 10 that after
[44:44] the 70 years be accomplished at Babylon
[44:47] we have a promise now that God will
[44:50] visit and that we will perform his good
[44:52] word toward you and causing you to
[44:55] return to the land amen God has given a
[44:59] promise to Israel and that same promise
[45:02] lies with the supernatural bride today
[45:04] that you're not going to be indentured
[45:06] servants you're not going to be in
[45:08] slavery indefinitely but God has
[45:10] promised you when this time has been
[45:12] fulfilled when the time of the the
[45:14] prophecy has come to pass he will bring
[45:17] you back to the land of
[45:20] promise so every Prophet looks back to
[45:22] see what the prophets before them would
[45:25] say and we find here Daniel looks back
[45:28] at Jeremiah he's looking to see when is
[45:30] this going to be accomplished not merely
[45:33] the destruction like I said of Babylon
[45:35] in the land of Chad but the time that
[45:37] the Jews are going to return back to
[45:39] their Homeland now for many of
[45:42] us Jew the Jews have always been in
[45:46] Israel okay for most of us here tonight
[45:49] many of us we grew up only knowing that
[45:51] the Jews are in their Homeland so we're
[45:54] going to we're going to jump off here
[45:57] we're going to spend the rest of the
[45:58] service dealing with the Jews because I
[46:00] want you to understand tonight you're a
[46:03] type okay little bride you're they're
[46:06] your type that's the natural bride
[46:09] you're the spiritual bride yes sir don't
[46:12] miss that tonight recognize where they
[46:15] are recognize where they've been
[46:18] recognize they've been taken captive
[46:20] generations and generations 70 years no
[46:24] not just 70 years in Babylon but it
[46:26] actually has a compound two-fold purpose
[46:29] that they're prophesying Daniel that
[46:31] there was going to be an end time when
[46:33] God is going to wrap all of it up and
[46:35] bring destruction to your adversary oh
[46:39] Hallelujah tonight God ain't going to
[46:41] let that enemy go unpunished for his
[46:43] attack to you tonight that's
[46:46] right so notice here we find that God
[46:50] has promise I'm going to cause you to
[46:52] return or I'm going to cause in to
[46:55] return to the place
[46:57] and never did God bless Israel outside
[47:01] of her promised
[47:02] land and God young person God will never
[47:06] bless you outside of the promised land
[47:09] you may drive a fancy car you may make
[47:11] lots of money you may have a knockout
[47:14] wife for a a wife it doesn't matter but
[47:17] all I can tell you that ain't God's
[47:19] blessing your blessing lies in the land
[47:22] of
[47:23] promise look Abraham left the land of
[47:26] promise and the prophet God said there
[47:27] was not one miracle done there that's
[47:30] right all right but see we may be
[47:32] blessed we may be successful but that's
[47:34] not a sign of God's blessing in the
[47:37] message be certain of God brother B will
[47:39] tell us like this and so is our Modern
[47:41] Trend today falling away from the things
[47:44] of God and has brought the world to one
[47:47] greatest ulies that we've had and he
[47:49] calls it it's idleness just idling
[47:52] around great is the iniquity of the
[47:54] people today making plenty of money and
[47:57] think that God's blessing us because
[47:58] he's prospered
[48:00] us he said that's no sign of God's
[48:03] blessing not at all right then again he
[48:08] goes and he says now what we need today
[48:09] is not a lot of material
[48:12] things not a lot of amens on that one
[48:15] did
[48:16] we we have that we don't need greater
[48:19] churches we don't need greater
[48:21] congregations we don't need more Radio
[48:23] and on television we don't need so many
[48:26] more of these things but what we need
[48:28] today to be spiritual is a person that
[48:31] will humble themselves before God come
[48:34] on church if they haven't got a penny
[48:38] and will pray till the spirit within
[48:40] them is satisfied with the goodness of
[48:42] God and the Revival takes place on the
[48:44] inside of their heart that changes their
[48:47] attitudes and the atmosphere that they
[48:49] live
[48:50] in he goes you might not have a pair of
[48:52] shoes on your feet you might be dressed
[48:54] in raged but something in your heart is
[48:57] singing The Melodies of God I'd rather
[48:59] have that than all the money in the
[49:02] world yes sir oh Hallelujah so you can't
[49:06] say that Natural Things is always a sign
[49:10] of God's blessing that's
[49:12] right but notice God never blessed
[49:16] Israel
[49:17] outside of her
[49:19] Homeland and God promised Israel in
[49:21] Genesis 15 and verse 18 if you could go
[49:24] there God promised Abraham seed a land
[49:29] right yes so we find this early on in
[49:34] human existence in the origin which is
[49:37] Genesis means the origin of the Bible so
[49:39] we or the origin so we find here Genesis
[49:42] 15 and verse 18 in the same day that the
[49:45] Lord made a covenant with Abram saying
[49:47] unto thy seed have I given this land
[49:50] from the
[49:51] river of the river of Egypt unto the
[49:54] Great River the river Euphrates the
[49:56] kenites the kites the catamites and the
[49:59] Hittites and the perizzites the rumes
[50:01] and the amorites and the Canaanites and
[50:03] the gites and the jebusites so God
[50:06] promised Israel this little stretch of
[50:10] land what's the big
[50:13] deal God promised them this
[50:17] land yes sir it's their land though they
[50:22] didn't occupy it already had squatters
[50:25] on the land it had tenants already on
[50:28] the land but yet God had already
[50:30] searched out the land god already made
[50:32] sure that it was a good land it was a
[50:35] plenteous land it was a land that flowed
[50:37] with milk and honey it was a land fit
[50:40] for his people otherwise God didn't want
[50:43] his people living in any other land but
[50:46] this little stretch of land let me tell
[50:49] you little bride God don't want you
[50:50] living off in some denominational
[50:52] existence God placed you in the promised
[50:55] land of the word of God and he sent you
[50:58] a message to bring you back to that
[51:00] little bitt Promised Land of the word
[51:03] and in that little land you're
[51:06] blessed hallelujah look little Israel
[51:08] she may have gone all through Europe and
[51:11] all through the Arab Nations and been
[51:13] successful but she never was blessed
[51:15] until she got back in her
[51:17] Homeland and little bride you'll never
[51:19] be blessed until you get back into the
[51:21] homeland of this world quit thinking
[51:24] about your own ideas and how Traditions
[51:27] that's been handed down from society or
[51:29] Generations it ain't about generational
[51:32] so uh hand me downs it ain't about
[51:34] generational of curses it ain't about
[51:36] man-made CES and dog it's about getting
[51:39] back to the homeland of the word of
[51:42] God then you'll be
[51:45] blessed then you can say Amen to the
[51:47] word then you don't mind getting a
[51:49] little excited a little emotional a
[51:51] little bit of Joy coming to the house of
[51:53] God cuz when you realize that's where
[51:56] your blessings
[51:58] l oh
[52:00] Hallelujah think about this the total
[52:03] area of the state of Israel is
[52:06] 22,45 KM or
[52:09] 8,630 square miles not very
[52:15] big
[52:16] Israel from from one point to the next
[52:19] the length of it is 420 km or 263 mies
[52:25] not very big
[52:27] and it's 72 mies across and the country
[52:31] is bordered by Lebanon to the north
[52:33] Syria to the North East Jordan to the
[52:35] east Egypt to the southwest and the
[52:37] Mediterranean Sea to the west and the
[52:40] mountains and plains and fertile land
[52:41] desert are often minutes apart so it's a
[52:44] blessed land fertile
[52:47] land and they say you can drive from
[52:50] east to west or from across it in 90
[52:52] minutes and to make the trip from north
[52:54] to south it takes n hours not a very big
[52:57] country not a very big country at all
[53:00] but God promised them that
[53:03] land what am I telling you God has
[53:05] promised you the same it may not appear
[53:09] to much it may not look like much to a
[53:11] lot of other people but to us we
[53:13] recognize God gave us the promise of it
[53:17] and we're only going to be blessed
[53:19] inside of that land that's right but
[53:22] what we find due to Israel's
[53:25] Disobedience God dispersed them and
[53:28] there's a term that is used called the
[53:30] dispora or the Exile or the displacement
[53:33] and the Jewish dispora or Exile is a
[53:36] dispersion of Israelite or Jews out of
[53:39] their ancient ancestral Homeland the
[53:41] land of Israel and their subsequent
[53:43] settlement in other parts of the globe
[53:46] the term Exile here denotes the fate of
[53:48] the Israelites who were taken into Exile
[53:51] from the Kingdom of Israel during the
[53:52] 8th
[53:54] Century okay that's a long time ago go
[53:57] folks and the Judit from the kingdom of
[54:00] Judah who were taken into Exile during
[54:02] the 6th Century BCE so the first Exile
[54:06] was the Assyrian Exile the explosion
[54:09] from the Kingdom of Israel began by
[54:11] tiglath Pizer III of Assyria in 733
[54:17] BCE this process was completed by Sargon
[54:20] I second with the destruction of the
[54:22] Kingdom in
[54:23] 722 after a threeyear Siege against
[54:25] Samaria and we also had the next
[54:28] experience of Exile was the Babylonian
[54:30] captivity in which portions of the
[54:32] population of the kingdom of Judah they
[54:34] were deported in 597 and again in 586 by
[54:39] the Neo Babylonian empire under the rule
[54:42] of Nebuchadnezzar the second so the
[54:44] Jewish dispor started long before the
[54:47] Romans got
[54:48] there okay but when the Assyrians
[54:52] conquered ear on 7:22 the Hebrew
[54:55] inhabitants were scattered all over the
[54:56] Middle East and these early victims of
[54:59] the dispersion disappeared utterly from
[55:01] the pages of
[55:02] History I want you to I'm trying to
[55:05] capitalize I want you to see way
[55:08] before even Christ came on the
[55:12] scene God's elect people were scattered
[55:15] that's right they were not in their
[55:17] Homeland right they were not in a place
[55:19] that they could be
[55:21] blessed a lot of it had to do with their
[55:23] Disobedience but we find here they say
[55:26] the historians would say it like this so
[55:28] from 597 onwards there were three
[55:31] distinctive groups of Hebrews a group in
[55:34] Babylon and other parts of the Middle
[55:35] East a group in Judea and another group
[55:38] in Egypt thus 597 is considered the
[55:42] beginning of the date of the Jewish
[55:45] dispora kicked out of their
[55:47] land and just as the Jews have been
[55:50] dispersed from their Homeland for more
[55:52] than 2500 years and Scattered throughout
[55:55] all the Arab Nations Egypt and European
[55:57] countries the true bride of Christ has
[56:00] been dispersed from her Homeland the
[56:02] word of God through seven Church
[56:06] ages she's been dispersed that's right
[56:09] she's been scattered because she
[56:11] followed ideas of man and we find here
[56:15] but God had promised just as he promised
[56:18] that Israel would be uh brought back to
[56:20] their Homeland God also promised that
[56:23] there would be a restoration of the brid
[56:25] tree
[56:27] notice in Ephesians
[56:29] 5:27 he said that he might present it to
[56:32] himself a glorious
[56:34] Church come on somebody say
[56:37] Amen he's talking about you he's going
[56:39] to present himself a glorious Church
[56:42] otherwise he's going to make ready a
[56:45] bride he's obligated to put you right
[56:48] where you can be blessed right where
[56:50] there be no spot there'll be no wrinkle
[56:52] there'll be no blemish you'll be
[56:54] perfectly lined up with the word of God
[56:57] for your hour remember brother Aaron
[57:00] said just last past Sunday it's the
[57:02] message of the hour that's right it
[57:05] brings the enlightenment for the hour
[57:08] and so we find here God had promised
[57:10] this and God be to deal with the Jews
[57:13] after the first world
[57:17] war and he dealt with them again after
[57:19] the second world war so the first world
[57:23] war 1915 191771 18 along those lines I
[57:26] want you to see this I'm going to bring
[57:27] some things out and I'm trying to hurry
[57:29] but I'm trying not to go too fast on
[57:32] thank you I will do that but we find he
[57:35] begins to deal with the Jews really we
[57:38] find a lot of it in the 1930s and the
[57:40] 1940s and I hope you understand what I'm
[57:42] alluding to there in the second world
[57:44] war but God began to do things and to
[57:47] Usher that little bride into her
[57:51] Homeland so at the same time God is
[57:54] beginning early in 19
[57:56] 175 in the first World War I want you to
[57:59] notice what comes on the scene for the
[58:01] spiritual bride in 1909 a prophet is
[58:05] born in 1933 at the age of 24 that
[58:10] Prophet preaches his first sermon in
[58:12] this that same year in 1933 he had seven
[58:16] continuous
[58:18] Visions then in
[58:20] 1936 he built brandom Tabernacle and was
[58:23] the
[58:23] pastor but notice things begin to shift
[58:27] and begin to change in 1946 he received
[58:30] an Angelic visitation on May the 7th of
[58:33] 1946 commissioning his worldwide
[58:36] Ministry and launching his campaign
[58:38] career into mid
[58:40] 1946
[58:42] right
[58:43] so no longer now was it a local
[58:48] Ministry no longer was it just contained
[58:50] to Jeffersonville Indiana New Albany now
[58:54] the commission
[58:56] because God was calling not just the
[58:58] Jeffersonville people not just the
[59:00] people in New Aly and and Louisville
[59:03] Kentucky now God was raising up a
[59:06] messenger to scatter around the world to
[59:09] call those that have been dispersed
[59:11] throughout all the lands to call
[59:13] Hallelujah call them back to the
[59:15] promised land of the word of God and we
[59:19] find here his first sermon that he
[59:22] preached in
[59:23] 1947 as we would consider well under his
[59:26] commission now he preaches faith is the
[59:29] substance yes sir then we drop down from
[59:32] a few years here if you don't if you
[59:34] allow me to as we kind of get into the
[59:36] meat of the context of brother Brand's
[59:38] Ministry 1962 the restoration of the
[59:41] brid tree I want you to see God is
[59:44] beginning to call out a spiritual bride
[59:47] and these sermon titles are showing what
[59:49] is he doing he's calling it out in the
[59:52] 1962 why am I against organized religion
[59:56] because organized religion is the
[59:58] foreign lands let me tell you little
[1:00:00] bride you don't belong in a foreign land
[1:00:02] you belong in the land of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:05] you belong in the land of the
[1:00:08] word then he preachers in 62 is this the
[1:00:12] sign of the end
[1:00:14] s now he's trying to bring things down
[1:00:16] cuz showing look he's W God is going to
[1:00:18] be wrapping things up here in a few
[1:00:20] short years then in 63 the way of a true
[1:00:23] Prophet showing that you can have faith
[1:00:25] in this prophet that this is what you to
[1:00:26] look for then God hiding himself in
[1:00:31] Simplicity yes sir cuz see the
[1:00:33] theologians over complicated things and
[1:00:35] today a lot of people want to over
[1:00:37] complicate this message but it's not
[1:00:40] complicated oh Hallelujah in 63 the
[1:00:43] miraculous takes place the seals are
[1:00:45] revealed he preaches the seals he also
[1:00:48] preaches in 63 the indictment but why
[1:00:51] why did he indict to generation why did
[1:00:53] he indict to religious leaders because a
[1:00:55] Cru crucified the word of God they
[1:00:59] crucified your Homeland they were
[1:01:01] throwing bombs in your Homeland say that
[1:01:04] God don't do these things anymore the
[1:01:06] Holy Ghost don't act the way it used to
[1:01:08] act signs and wonders are something of
[1:01:10] yesterday but God sent a prophet to tell
[1:01:12] you it belongs Hallelujah in the
[1:01:14] Homeland healing belongs in the Homeland
[1:01:17] Deliverance belongs in the Homeland the
[1:01:20] prodical belong in the Homeland your
[1:01:22] destroyed marriage can be restored in
[1:01:25] the Homeland
[1:01:26] land
[1:01:29] Hallelujah notice then in 63 he preaches
[1:01:31] the uniting time and sign then the token
[1:01:35] the literal Life of Christ dwelling in
[1:01:36] the bride then he preaches Christ is the
[1:01:39] mystery of God revealed and in 64 God
[1:01:43] God's provided way for this day CU he
[1:01:46] don't want you to miss it that's right
[1:01:48] Sister Jenny he don't want you to miss
[1:01:49] it God's provided way for this day not
[1:01:53] Paul's day not Luther's day not Wesley's
[1:01:55] day today this day little
[1:01:58] church notice then he preaches the
[1:02:01] Mighty God unveiled before us oh these
[1:02:04] are beautiful sermon titles but it's
[1:02:07] more than a title it's God calling on
[1:02:10] that elect seed that's right God the
[1:02:13] Mighty God unveiled before us then in 64
[1:02:16] the identified Masterpiece of God here
[1:02:19] he shows that the bride is his
[1:02:23] Masterpiece oh brother Aaron did it so
[1:02:25] wonderful for Sunday showing that many
[1:02:27] people have made this message about a
[1:02:29] prophet about a prophet about a prophet
[1:02:30] it never was about a prophet but it was
[1:02:33] about a prophet raising up and going
[1:02:35] into the far ends of the world to call
[1:02:38] out the elect to call out the disperse
[1:02:40] to call out that genuine true bride
[1:02:43] that's been disported through the lands
[1:02:45] and bring her back to the homeland of
[1:02:47] the word of God it never was about
[1:02:49] William brand it's always been about you
[1:02:51] little bride he's calling natural Israel
[1:02:55] and he's call call in spiritualism come
[1:02:57] home to the word come home to the land
[1:03:00] and let me bless you tonight let me pour
[1:03:03] out my blessing that's where you'll be
[1:03:04] blessed is in the land of
[1:03:09] promise then he preaches the sea is not
[1:03:12] air with the
[1:03:14] shut 1965 then he preaches the anointed
[1:03:17] ones at the end time showing there's
[1:03:19] going to be anointed ones the anointing
[1:03:22] is true but they're
[1:03:24] false but but there is a genuine
[1:03:26] anointing at the end
[1:03:28] time then he preaches Christ is revealed
[1:03:31] in his own word right
[1:03:33] here Christ is not the denomination not
[1:03:37] man's idea not man's view not your idea
[1:03:39] your view but Christ is revealed right
[1:03:42] here how when it comes to
[1:03:44] pass when the word is
[1:03:48] fulfilled amen amen then in 65 he
[1:03:51] preaches the invisible Union of the
[1:03:53] bride of Christ where there is an
[1:03:55] visible Union takes place before the
[1:03:58] Rapture let me tell you little bride you
[1:04:00] better have that Union tonight don't
[1:04:04] wait then in ' 65 toward the end of 1965
[1:04:08] I believe it was in December he preaches
[1:04:11] the Rapture the secret snatching away of
[1:04:15] the Bride then he preaches things that
[1:04:18] are to be and in modern events made
[1:04:20] clear by
[1:04:22] prophecy all of this to to get a bride
[1:04:26] yeah to bring you back to the homeland
[1:04:30] of the word we call it the message of
[1:04:33] the
[1:04:33] hour that's our homeland that's where
[1:04:36] we're blessed the Jews call it
[1:04:39] Israel it's a little land it's despised
[1:04:43] it's hated by its enemies they're all
[1:04:45] around trying to destroy it let me tell
[1:04:47] you but for you it's a glorious land and
[1:04:51] for Israel it's a glorious land for them
[1:04:56] brother B says in 1947 experience the
[1:04:58] church has failed see instead of
[1:05:00] bringing the people together as one body
[1:05:03] it's separated them out so the church
[1:05:07] will never take the people over
[1:05:09] Jordan you believe that the church will
[1:05:12] never take the people over Jordan
[1:05:15] because the Baptist are going to take
[1:05:16] you to a Baptist view the Methodist are
[1:05:18] going to give you a Methodist few the
[1:05:20] Pentecostals give you a lot of
[1:05:22] excitement but ain't going to give you
[1:05:23] no word and then you got the Lutheran
[1:05:25] and the Holiness they're all going to
[1:05:27] give you their
[1:05:28] view oh but when God sends a prophet and
[1:05:32] God sends a messenger he's not giving
[1:05:34] you that view and that view and that
[1:05:36] dogma and that Creed and that idea he's
[1:05:39] giv you God's revelation for the word so
[1:05:43] that you can be blessed in the Homeland
[1:05:45] and if you got a need it's in the word
[1:05:47] you got a need for healing it lays in
[1:05:50] the word that he is the same yesterday
[1:05:52] today and forever and what God did he
[1:05:56] does and what he is or what he was he
[1:05:58] still is little
[1:06:01] bride notice this
[1:06:03] Propet begins to call out and and we
[1:06:06] find the scriptures come out of her my
[1:06:09] people so notice you don't belong to the
[1:06:12] systems you belong to God come out of
[1:06:16] her come out of the denominational
[1:06:18] systems come out of the foreign lands
[1:06:20] come out of Egypt come out of the Arab
[1:06:22] Nations come out of all the European
[1:06:24] countries that you've been dispersed to
[1:06:26] little bride and come back to the word
[1:06:29] of God and be not partakers with her
[1:06:33] plagge so we find as early as
[1:06:37] 1947 God be to
[1:06:41] restore a bride amen all right word on
[1:06:45] top of word on top of word on top of
[1:06:48] word on top of
[1:06:50] word begin to Resto how important are
[1:06:53] you little church I mean come on how
[1:06:58] maybe you woke up this morning you
[1:06:59] didn't feel very important but God sent
[1:07:02] you a message to pull you out of that
[1:07:05] nonsense to pull you out of your own
[1:07:08] thinking to pull you out of that system
[1:07:10] of religion that maybe you've been tied
[1:07:12] up in some of you come out of the
[1:07:13] Baptist some of the older ones some of
[1:07:15] you young ones you ain't never known
[1:07:16] nothing but a message Pew but for some
[1:07:18] of us we come out of those man-made
[1:07:20] Creeds we come out of those foreign
[1:07:22] lands and let me tell you I know what it
[1:07:24] was in the Baptist Church I know what it
[1:07:26] was like in a Pentecostal church I know
[1:07:28] how dead it was in the Methodist church
[1:07:30] but I now I know how it is to be in the
[1:07:32] homeland of the word I know the joy of
[1:07:34] serving the Living God I know the
[1:07:36] realities of the Holy Ghost I know
[1:07:38] healing I know Deliverance I know the
[1:07:41] manifestation in this hour cuz why cuz
[1:07:44] we're in the whole land of the word of
[1:07:47] God oh
[1:07:50] Hallelujah so no longer was it a local
[1:07:54] Ministry now become a
[1:07:56] worldwide Ministry to call out the
[1:08:00] elect oh Hallelujah and brother man will
[1:08:02] tell us this and I'm going to try to go
[1:08:05] probably 45 minutes so 45 more minutes
[1:08:09] just putting y'all own flash leave it
[1:08:11] don't look at that
[1:08:16] clock notice he says God deals with the
[1:08:19] Gentiles as individuals
[1:08:23] yes Israel as a nation
[1:08:26] so he deals with you personally
[1:08:29] amen so Jay you can't get in on brother
[1:08:32] L Joseph you're not going to get in on
[1:08:35] me Jude as good as you are nice looking
[1:08:38] tall dark and handsome you're not
[1:08:39] getting in on your
[1:08:40] daddy girls you're not going to make it
[1:08:42] on Mama God deals with us as individuals
[1:08:47] but he deals with Israel as a
[1:08:51] nation notice now in Matthew 2 4 and
[1:08:55] verse one and Jesus went out and he
[1:08:57] departed from the temple and his
[1:08:59] disciples came to him for to show him
[1:09:02] the building of the
[1:09:04] temple and Jesus said unto them see you
[1:09:06] not all these things for verily I say
[1:09:08] unto you there shall not be left one
[1:09:11] stone upon another that shall not be
[1:09:13] thrown down and he sat and in verse
[1:09:16] three he said he sat in the Mount of
[1:09:17] Olives and the disciples came unto him
[1:09:19] properly saying tell us they're
[1:09:22] inquisitive tell us when shall these
[1:09:25] things be and what shall be the sign of
[1:09:27] thy coming and the end of the world and
[1:09:31] we're still wanting to know the end of
[1:09:32] the
[1:09:33] world I'm giving you a clue tonight if
[1:09:35] you just watch you'll find your time
[1:09:40] piece Matthew 24:1 15 notice they ask
[1:09:44] when will it be in Jesus in 24:15 he
[1:09:47] says when you therefore shall see the
[1:09:49] abomination of desolation spoken by
[1:09:52] Daniel the
[1:09:54] Prophet and then Gabriel's instructions
[1:09:56] to Daniel brother BR says now he's
[1:09:58] talking to the Jews they want to know
[1:10:01] what about this Temple when will it be
[1:10:04] destroyed when will it be rebuilt when
[1:10:06] will there come a time that there won't
[1:10:08] be one stone left on another how long
[1:10:10] will it last otherwise when will the end
[1:10:13] time
[1:10:15] come and brother B says now this is one
[1:10:18] of the most important scriptures in the
[1:10:21] book don't let this go over your head
[1:10:23] tonight church he said this is one of
[1:10:25] the most important scriptures in the big
[1:10:27] what does he do it tells the closing of
[1:10:30] the Jewish Nations referring to Daniel 9
[1:10:33] the the closing of the Jewish Nation the
[1:10:35] Jewish people this scripture the 70
[1:10:38] weeks it discloses and tells exactly
[1:10:41] from the time that Daniel started there
[1:10:43] until the end of the consummation and he
[1:10:46] says it's one of the greatest time
[1:10:49] pieces so if you want to know where we
[1:10:52] are
[1:10:55] if you want to know what day of the week
[1:10:57] it is you look at the calendar if you
[1:10:59] wanted to know what time it is it is
[1:11:01] practically 801 I look at my clock but
[1:11:04] if you want to know where we are in time
[1:11:06] in the essence of the end time you watch
[1:11:12] Israel Israel is your time piece
[1:11:15] there're your watch there're your clock
[1:11:17] that's why it's so important for us to
[1:11:20] understand Daniel's 70 weeks look it
[1:11:22] doesn't pertain to the Gentiles it
[1:11:25] doesn't pertain to us at all it pertains
[1:11:27] to the Jews but you can watch the Jews
[1:11:30] you can watch where Israel's at she's
[1:11:32] been been dispersed throughout many
[1:11:34] lands but now today she's back in the
[1:11:39] Homeland I'm not going to try to get
[1:11:41] ahead of myself he said it has nothing
[1:11:43] to do with the Gentiles those Seven
[1:11:45] Seals seven plagues seven woes seven
[1:11:47] trumpets has not one thing to do the
[1:11:50] Gentile church will be in glory at that
[1:11:53] time oh come on somebody yeah that
[1:11:56] Gentile church we ain't going to be here
[1:11:58] when destruction comes let me tell you
[1:12:00] when when we leave we're going to wave
[1:12:02] at those atomic nuclear bombs byebye
[1:12:06] hope you hit your target we're gone
[1:12:08] brother BR would tell us and I spoke of
[1:12:10] it last time she's up at the in the
[1:12:12] eternities up in heaven getting
[1:12:15] married oh come on some of you little
[1:12:17] brides yes sir you just waiting for that
[1:12:21] day man got to go check my venue out got
[1:12:25] to make sure it's going to satisfy all
[1:12:27] my guests let me tell you he saids I go
[1:12:30] to prepare a place for you and if it
[1:12:32] were not so I would have told you let me
[1:12:34] tell it's a great land let me tell you
[1:12:36] where we're going is a great land little
[1:12:38] bride but you got to come back to this
[1:12:40] land before you get to that land come on
[1:12:43] some of you put a smile on your face
[1:12:44] it's Wednesday
[1:12:46] night it don't pertain to us but we can
[1:12:49] watch the
[1:12:50] clock and we can see exactly where we
[1:12:54] are that's right oh I love this he said
[1:12:57] it discloses the facts that God Deals
[1:13:00] Only with the Jews when they are in the
[1:13:02] Homeland
[1:13:04] hallelujah oh yes so we look at Isaiah
[1:13:07] 11:11 you don't have to turn there but I
[1:13:09] just want to paraphrase so Isaiah 11:11
[1:13:12] is a scripture that predicts or
[1:13:14] prophesies that God will gather the
[1:13:16] children of Israel back to their
[1:13:18] Homeland so God ain't going to leave his
[1:13:21] elect
[1:13:22] dispersed oh come on
[1:13:25] I mean some of you got wer children out
[1:13:27] there God ain't going to leave that seed
[1:13:30] dispersed uhuh a Son of God can go a
[1:13:33] long time brother Daryl before he
[1:13:34] recognized he's a Son of God but apps a
[1:13:37] seed in there he belongs in the Homeland
[1:13:39] he belongs in the word he may be on
[1:13:42] their deathbed but let me tell you he's
[1:13:43] coming back cuz God's got a prophecy
[1:13:46] over him God's got a word over him and
[1:13:49] that word will not return for but he
[1:13:51] will go and snatch up that little seat
[1:13:56] they may be two breaths away from
[1:13:58] entering to the other side before they
[1:13:59] give their heart to God but God's
[1:14:02] determined right let me just say it like
[1:14:04] this God is determined to get his bride
[1:14:06] in the Homeland God is determined to get
[1:14:09] the elect into a land that he can bless
[1:14:11] them why is all this Beall me God's
[1:14:14] trying to get you in a
[1:14:16] land oh my Jeremiah 29 And1 as we read
[1:14:19] the Prophet Jeremiah predicts that
[1:14:21] Israel will return to their Homeland
[1:14:23] after the 70 years of captivity then
[1:14:26] Genesis 17 god affirms with Abraham the
[1:14:29] Covenant I've given you this land not
[1:14:33] just a land not just any land this
[1:14:38] land something special but that little
[1:14:41] sliver of
[1:14:42] Landen notice brother man says I've
[1:14:45] always told you if you want to know what
[1:14:47] day of the week it is look at the
[1:14:49] calender but if you want to know the
[1:14:51] time we're living in watch those Jews
[1:14:55] that's the only time piece God LED no
[1:14:59] certain time for the Gentile there was
[1:15:01] no certain space of time he says and
[1:15:04] that's where I think that many great
[1:15:05] writers mixed it up trying to apply this
[1:15:07] to the Jew and Gentile because he said
[1:15:09] thy people but he was talking to Daniel
[1:15:13] not to the church Daniel's people is the
[1:15:15] Jew that's right so he was talking to
[1:15:18] the church see he goes if he was talking
[1:15:20] to the church you can't make that run
[1:15:22] nowhere you're you're way way back he
[1:15:25] says even before the coming of Christ
[1:15:26] it'll run right out any kind of
[1:15:28] prophetic weeks you want to you want to
[1:15:30] put it in it's already run out but he
[1:15:33] was talking to the Jews so therefore the
[1:15:35] Jews is God's time
[1:15:38] pieace so Daniel 70 weeks has nothing to
[1:15:41] do with the church the 70 weeks has
[1:15:43] nothing to do with the church so why is
[1:15:46] it so important because they are your
[1:15:47] time
[1:15:48] piece some of you know what day it is
[1:15:51] today October the what how'd you know
[1:15:54] that I don't
[1:16:02] know some people you need to get a
[1:16:05] calendar but you know it's October 2nd
[1:16:08] because you woke up many of us have
[1:16:09] iPhones and right on the front screen it
[1:16:12] tells you October 2nd and it tells you
[1:16:14] the time so now Gentiles brother B says
[1:16:17] was not a lot at a certain time the time
[1:16:20] of the Gentiles and when we find out
[1:16:22] Jesus didn't lot them time for we find
[1:16:24] out in Luke and he goes to Luke 21- 24
[1:16:27] and they shall fall by the edge of the
[1:16:28] sword and shall be led away captive and
[1:16:31] to all the nations of Jerusalem shall be
[1:16:33] trien down of the Gentiles until the
[1:16:35] time of the Gentiles is fulfilled so we
[1:16:37] don't know how long that time is but we
[1:16:40] do know that there was 70 weeks a lotted
[1:16:42] to the Jews that's right so if you want
[1:16:45] to know where we are you just put your
[1:16:47] eyes on little
[1:16:48] Israel and you keep your eyes on little
[1:16:51] Israel and that's why you don't curse
[1:16:53] Israel because he that cursed her will
[1:16:55] cursed and he that blessed her will be
[1:16:56] blessed
[1:16:57] amen he said there isn't a lot of time
[1:17:00] but nobody knows when it will be talking
[1:17:03] about the Gentile now he said the
[1:17:04] Gentile time but the Jews we cannot tell
[1:17:07] time by what the church whether it's
[1:17:09] backslid or whether it's going on or
[1:17:10] what it's doing you can't tell by that
[1:17:13] but look at the Jews that's the time
[1:17:16] calendar do you see it God did lot them
[1:17:19] exactly a day an hour of time but he
[1:17:21] never the Gentile he did the Jews so
[1:17:24] let's watch the Jews
[1:17:26] amen then you'll see where you're at and
[1:17:30] in Matthew 24:32 he says now learn a
[1:17:33] parable of the Fig Tree when his branch
[1:17:35] is yet tender he putteth forth his
[1:17:38] leaves and you know that summer is not
[1:17:42] and before we get to Matthew
[1:17:44] 24:32 we find Jesus he speaks of the
[1:17:47] signs of the end in Matthew 24
[1:17:50] 3-14 the abomination of desolation in
[1:17:52] Matthew 24:1 15-28 and the coming of the
[1:17:55] son of man in Matthew 24:
[1:17:57] 29-31 so we find all this he wraps it
[1:18:00] all up in Matthew
[1:18:02] 24 what is how it's exactly going to
[1:18:05] play
[1:18:06] out so we find there's going to be a
[1:18:08] signs of the end there's going to be the
[1:18:09] Abomination desolation but during that
[1:18:11] time God's going to there's going to be
[1:18:12] the coming of the son of man and the Fig
[1:18:15] Tree is going to put forth
[1:18:18] buds cuz he's giving you something to
[1:18:20] look for he's giving you something a
[1:18:23] road Mark when you drive down the
[1:18:25] highway you know before we had
[1:18:28] GPS you know before we had atlases that
[1:18:30] we toted around in our cars they would
[1:18:33] say turn a certain certain place you're
[1:18:34] going to see this big sign here and
[1:18:36] you're going to turn and take it right
[1:18:37] there or this here and so we find that
[1:18:40] this budding fourth of the Fig Tree is a
[1:18:42] marker telling us where we are on the
[1:18:44] road map that's that you're close to
[1:18:47] going home
[1:18:48] that's so Israel he says now here in
[1:18:53] 1960 and I want you to the clue in here
[1:18:55] I'm paying attention to that clock trust
[1:18:57] me and Israel for her first time for
[1:19:01] 2500 years is restored again to
[1:19:05] Jerusalem he says oh people don't let
[1:19:08] that go over your head right that's the
[1:19:11] Fig Tree putting forth its buz this
[1:19:14] generation he says 40 years is declared
[1:19:17] a generation and it's already been a
[1:19:19] long time way into 10 to 12 years he
[1:19:22] says we're into the last generation
[1:19:24] ation he preached this in 1960 so now
[1:19:27] Israel is 76 years old as a nation and I
[1:19:31] ask you Church how close are
[1:19:35] we we're 76 years Israel is as a nation
[1:19:39] how close are we don't let this go over
[1:19:41] your head don't let what happened
[1:19:43] yesterday to Israel being attacked by
[1:19:46] Iran being in war with Hezbollah don't
[1:19:48] let these things go over your head watch
[1:19:51] up yeah look and see what's happening
[1:19:54] because any moment God can come and
[1:19:56] snatch away this little bride because
[1:19:58] she is the time
[1:20:00] piece we don't know the hour we don't
[1:20:02] know the day no man knows the Bible says
[1:20:05] the day that you think not but one thing
[1:20:06] we do know you can put your eyes on
[1:20:09] little Israel and you can see God
[1:20:11] dealing with her and that's your time
[1:20:13] piece let me tell you the coming of the
[1:20:15] Lord just throw everybody in the church
[1:20:17] tonight into desperation Lord I Want My
[1:20:20] My Heart Right Lord I want to live a
[1:20:22] true life in case you come tonight I

[1:20:28] don't want to be left down here I don't
[1:20:30] want to be left for
[1:20:32] Destruction he says here sir we will see
[1:20:35] Jesus a nation will be saved when Israel
[1:20:38] comes it will be just borned overnight
[1:20:40] when Israel will come to God at one time
[1:20:43] and in May 14th 1948 Israel was
[1:20:47] officially declared an independent state
[1:20:49] with David benguan the head of the
[1:20:51] Jewish agency as the Prime Minister and
[1:20:53] notice in May 1948 Israel declared its
[1:20:56] independence and was immediately invaded
[1:20:59] by armies of five Arab
[1:21:03] Nations as soon as it declared its
[1:21:06] independence it was invaded let me tell
[1:21:08] you the enemy has done everything it can
[1:21:10] to destroy Israel and your enemy has
[1:21:12] done everything it can to destroy you
[1:21:15] but she still
[1:21:17] standing there was over 200 missiles
[1:21:20] thre at her yesterday and she has three
[1:21:22] Defense Forces and all three of them
[1:21:25] operated simultaneously they said it was
[1:21:27] an act of God just like The Parting of
[1:21:29] the Red Sea not one missile landed in a
[1:21:33] particular place they let it in sand
[1:21:35] they let it in water and it caused no
[1:21:37] destruction to Israel you telling me
[1:21:40] that Iran got it so figured out that
[1:21:42] they can't bomb a little land like this
[1:21:44] they can't hit the target what am I
[1:21:46] telling you the devil can't hit his
[1:21:48] Target tonight he can't hit you tonight
[1:21:51] your God's elect
[1:21:55] you're God's elect tonight he's got to
[1:21:57] go before your father to get permission
[1:22:00] before he Touch One hair on your
[1:22:01] [Applause]
[1:22:03] head let me get just a tad bit more
[1:22:05] volume because my little controller
[1:22:07] ain't
[1:22:08] working oh Hallelujah God deals with
[1:22:10] Israel only when she is in the her
[1:22:14] Homeland pay
[1:22:16] attention only when she is in her
[1:22:20] Homeland Abraham left a Homeland and
[1:22:22] went to Egypt what happened he walked
[1:22:24] away from the will of God never was
[1:22:26] blessed till he returned back to the
[1:22:28] Homeland God never dealt with him not
[1:22:31] One Vision not one nothing else till he
[1:22:34] was back in the Homeland right so why
[1:22:38] does the nominal system don't have what
[1:22:41] we
[1:22:42] have it's not the
[1:22:45] Homeland oh church not trying to set
[1:22:49] ourselves apart make something big of
[1:22:51] ourselves God placed us here God gave us
[1:22:55] this message God sent you a prophet to
[1:22:57] call you out of those systems he says oh
[1:23:00] God we're glad today to see Israel
[1:23:02] coming to our homeland of nation the old
[1:23:05] Sixpoint star David flying under them
[1:23:07] Jews were turning say they'll never come
[1:23:10] back in to die in the Homeland but they
[1:23:12] come back to see the
[1:23:14] Messiah oh hallelujah oh they come back
[1:23:18] to see the Messiah he said now he said
[1:23:20] God we know then that our hour our days
[1:23:23] are number we're watching watching just
[1:23:25] as Noah watched Enoch and not
[1:23:26] immediately after Enoch come to judgment
[1:23:28] was going to strike the Earth we see the
[1:23:31] Ark of the Jew being prepared again we
[1:23:33] know that the translation is at
[1:23:38] hand then we find in the seventh week of
[1:23:43] Daniel brother B says after the first
[1:23:45] world war so God be to deal with the
[1:23:49] Jews so for 40 years they began to come
[1:23:52] into their Homeland then we get into
[1:23:53] 1930 33 and there become a man who rose
[1:23:56] on the scene over in Germany by the name
[1:23:58] of Adolf Hitler but before him in 1922
[1:24:01] 25 there's a man named melini that rises
[1:24:04] on the scene and we go into a whole
[1:24:06] another story on them maybe another
[1:24:08] service but for tonight brother BR said
[1:24:11] God went to harden melini's heart
[1:24:14] Hitler's heart Stalin's heart hearts of
[1:24:16] men all over the country hating the Jews
[1:24:20] why why did God go to harden their
[1:24:23] hearts
[1:24:27] push him get back get to the
[1:24:31] Homeland oh get back in the Homeland get
[1:24:34] back where I can bless you so he be to
[1:24:36] harden man's
[1:24:38] heart no he said it was in Germany up in
[1:24:41] Russia Italy the people raised up Joseph
[1:24:45] Hitler stal melini who hated the Jews
[1:24:47] they had to go back to their Homeland he
[1:24:50] said God you got ways of doing things
[1:24:53] that we don't understand understand
[1:24:55] that's right and you press them no home
[1:24:58] in Germany everything taken away from
[1:25:01] them also in Italy Russia no place to go
[1:25:04] they were sent back to their Homeland
[1:25:06] just to fulfill the
[1:25:10] word and so is it for the
[1:25:13] bride you have no home in the Baptist
[1:25:17] system you have no home in the
[1:25:19] Pentecostal Church you have no home in
[1:25:23] Wesley's Methodist system our Luther's
[1:25:26] Lutheran system our homeland is the word
[1:25:29] of
[1:25:33] God and in this word there's signs
[1:25:36] there's wonders there's healings there's
[1:25:37] Miracles there's Deliverance whatever
[1:25:40] you have all the precious Promises of
[1:25:43] God lay in the
[1:25:45] homand then he says in the third exod oh
[1:25:48] the loving hand of God how sometimes it
[1:25:51] looks cruel the way that people suffer
[1:25:54] but it still it's the tender hand of
[1:26:00] Jehovah you're telling me that a great
[1:26:02] world war is the tender hand of
[1:26:07] Jehovah World War II was a deest
[1:26:10] military
[1:26:11] conflict in terms of total dead 75
[1:26:15] million people casualties included
[1:26:18] military and civilian around 3% of the
[1:26:20] world's population died as a result of
[1:26:24] World War II many civilians died because
[1:26:27] of deliberate genocide massacres Mass
[1:26:29] bombings disease and starvation the
[1:26:31] Soviet Union lost 27 million people
[1:26:34] during the war 8.7 military 19 million
[1:26:39] civilians Germany sustained 5.3 military
[1:26:42] losses mostly on the Eastern Front
[1:26:45] fighting fighting Russia and we find
[1:26:48] Nazi Germany as part of the deliberate
[1:26:50] program of extermination systematically
[1:26:52] killed over 11 million people and six
[1:26:55] million Jews of that 11 million so in
[1:26:59] addition to Nazi concentration camps the
[1:27:01] Soviet Googs or labor camps led to the
[1:27:04] death of
[1:27:05] 3.6 million
[1:27:08] people yet after all this death after
[1:27:10] all this destruction after all this
[1:27:13] cruelty it's the tender hand of Jehovah
[1:27:17] that's
[1:27:18] right yet some of us would disagree how
[1:27:22] could God do that how could God permit
[1:27:25] that cuz God is determined to get his
[1:27:27] people back in the home God's determined
[1:27:30] where he can get them to bless them
[1:27:32] notice they were never going to see the
[1:27:34] Messiah in in the Arab Nations they were
[1:27:37] never going to see the Messiah in Egypt
[1:27:39] they were never going to see the Messiah
[1:27:41] in those European countries they were
[1:27:43] only going to see the prophecy said only
[1:27:46] in the land of promise that God already
[1:27:49] picked out searched out and dedicated
[1:27:52] and deed it over to them they only see
[1:27:55] the Messiah in that land that's where
[1:27:58] the blessing is that's where the
[1:27:59] blessing lies it's not with wealth and
[1:28:01] prosperity but it lies and seeing church
[1:28:04] it's seeing the Messiah and in the
[1:28:06] promised land of this word we're going
[1:28:07] to see our Messiah we're going to see
[1:28:10] our Jesus we're going to Rapture out of
[1:28:12] here in the land of promise that's why
[1:28:15] we got to get back that's why we got to
[1:28:17] encourage the Y get back to the word get
[1:28:20] back to the Homeland
[1:28:24] don't be ashamed of the emotion don't be
[1:28:26] ashamed of this message don't be ashamed
[1:28:29] of the excitement it brings it brings a
[1:28:31] reality we're not going back to the
[1:28:33] Homeland to die we're going brother to
[1:28:36] see the
[1:28:37] Messiah we're going to meet Jesus we're
[1:28:40] going to a wedding
[1:28:42] supper
[1:28:43] Hallelujah the tender hand of Jehovah
[1:28:46] leading his children back to the
[1:28:50] Homeland God is more determined than you
[1:28:53] are to make sure you're where you need
[1:28:55] to
[1:28:57] be did you hear that God is more than
[1:29:01] termined why does he let certain things
[1:29:04] happen to your offspring that are
[1:29:07] wavered why does he let certain

[1:29:43] been for Stalin have it not been for a

[1:35:20] donkeys thank God we don't live in yeman
[1:35:24] he said the village all Jewish very
[1:35:26] close proximity to all rare Village made
[1:35:29] up about 40 Jewish families all inter
[1:35:31] married with each other because they
[1:35:33] were disconnected from other Jewish
[1:35:35] community so everyone was related to
[1:35:37] everyone to Market toown was a big city
[1:35:40] at TZ which my grandmother said was
[1:35:42] about half a donkeys ride away well this
[1:35:46] is how you measure
[1:35:47] time once on the road notice once on the
[1:35:50] road the two men Mr oi's father named n
[1:35:54] which means Miracles met a stranger also
[1:35:57] on donkey back that man was a esan Jew
[1:36:02] he didn't look Jewish but he said Shalom
[1:36:05] malum to them and they just looked at
[1:36:08] him and startled they said who are you
[1:36:10] he said I am a shile a messenger from
[1:36:14] Israel from Israel he says from Israel a
[1:36:17] state of whose existence they had not
[1:36:19] heard although it was a land where they
[1:36:21] believed someday their descendants would
[1:36:22] visit they said you don't look Jewish
[1:36:25] but the shelite he started reciting the
[1:36:28] sheima and by the end of their first
[1:36:30] paragraph they said we believe you and
[1:36:34] the shac said you should go back to your
[1:36:36] Homeland look he told him we have our
[1:36:38] own State now we have a leader whose
[1:36:40] name is David Ben gurian and another
[1:36:41] leader who is MOSI and he goes now said
[1:36:44] they ask well how would we get there and
[1:36:47] he said the airplanes will be waiting
[1:36:50] for you in Aiden the British control y
[1:36:53] seap Port about two week donkey ride
[1:36:55] away so they asked him what is an
[1:36:58] airplane and he took out a piece of
[1:37:00] paper out of his pocket and he drew on
[1:37:01] it and they looked at it and they said
[1:37:03] it looks like an
[1:37:06] eagle so I'm trying to P I'm trying to
[1:37:08] bring your reality when you hear brother
[1:37:10] Brandon quote these quotes now you can
[1:37:12] see the images in which he saw now you
[1:37:15] can see the detail in which they live
[1:37:17] notice now he says that's what God
[1:37:19] promised to send us to take us there
[1:37:21] Exodus 19 God talks about bringing
[1:37:24] Israelites out of Egypt On Eagle's Wings
[1:37:26] and the promise of in the Gathering of
[1:37:28] the Exiles on Eagle wings Echoes into
[1:37:31] the Jewish dreams he goes back on the
[1:37:33] dusty road to Y the man pulled out a
[1:37:35] loaf of bread out of a bag and he said
[1:37:36] this is what I brought you so take it
[1:37:38] back to the village and show them and
[1:37:40] tell them he said so my father and his
[1:37:42] friend they turned around they went back
[1:37:44] to the Village they told the rabbi the
[1:37:46] rabbi said assemble everyone in the
[1:37:47] synagogue they said to haleel in a
[1:37:50] service of gratitude and Thanksgiving on
[1:37:52] the that set on holiday days and they
[1:37:54] said the blessing for the New Year's and
[1:37:56] then the rabbi told everybody to be
[1:37:57] ready to move in 5
[1:38:00] days see there was something in their
[1:38:02] heart they didn't have to debate about
[1:38:04] it they were ready to get back to a
[1:38:06] Homeland that they never seen they
[1:38:09] didn't even know existed but something
[1:38:11] inside of them called them back to it oh
[1:38:14] Hallelujah he say so we went to Aiden he
[1:38:17] goes in 5 days they left they rode their
[1:38:19] donkeys to Aiden and so we went to Aiden
[1:38:22] and the jdc the Jewish agency took good
[1:38:24] care of them and they prayed that God
[1:38:26] would send the Eagles and that was the
[1:38:29] air lft sometimes known as operation
[1:38:31] flying carpet but known to the people
[1:38:33] who had brought new lives as on the
[1:38:36] wings of
[1:38:37] eagles and this is where brother Brown
[1:38:40] says that old Rabbi stood there and he
[1:38:42] said remember our Prophet said when we
[1:38:44] go back to the Homeland we're going to
[1:38:46] be carried back on the wings of an
[1:38:49] eagle so it's the Homeland church and
[1:38:52] brother brand almost went to Israel but
[1:38:56] I want you to know Israel was never
[1:38:57] promised a gentile Prophet they were
[1:38:59] promised a Jewish Prophet so he couldn't
[1:39:02] go he said I made a split second
[1:39:04] decision but he said the spirit spoke to
[1:39:06] me says not now this is not the time the
[1:39:10] cup of iniquity of the Gentiles is not
[1:39:12] yet full go back oh because God has two
[1:39:16] prophets ready for
[1:39:19] Israel and notice in 1948 Israel's
[1:39:22] population was 800 6,000 today is 9.8
[1:39:26] million people with 75% being Jews yes
[1:39:30] sir oh Hallelujah prise God 2500 years
[1:39:34] the Jews has been scattered to every
[1:39:36] nation under Heaven God hardened
[1:39:38] Pharaoh's heart bringing them back he
[1:39:40] hardened Hitler's heart melini's heart
[1:39:43] and so forth till he drove them back to
[1:39:45] Palestine coming back they had made them
[1:39:47] a nation again on May the 6th 1947 the
[1:39:51] Jewish flag was raised over for the
[1:39:53] first time for 2500 years the oldest
[1:39:57] flag in the world was raised for the
[1:39:59] first time in 2500 years are you coming
[1:40:02] back to the Homeland to die they said no
[1:40:05] we're coming back to see the
[1:40:08] Messiah Allelujah he said the Fig Tree
[1:40:11] is putting forth its
[1:40:13] buds he goes oh the great Church of the
[1:40:15] Living God notice he parallels this down
[1:40:18] to the bride he said the great Church of
[1:40:19] the Living God will be raised like on
[1:40:21] wings of an eagle packed out out yonder
[1:40:23] into Glory why did God send you a
[1:40:26] prophet he sent you an eagle because
[1:40:29] what he does in the natural he also does
[1:40:31] it in the spiritual that's right when is
[1:40:34] God going to start this last week
[1:40:36] speaking of the 70 weeks of Daniel it
[1:40:39] may be today it may be before the sunset
[1:40:41] tonight God will declare he says we are
[1:40:45] at the Homeland the Jews are in the
[1:40:47] Homeland we're at the End of the Age
[1:40:49] ready for the Rapture the Rapture comes
[1:40:51] the church goes up we're caught up to
[1:40:53] meet him in the air we know that the
[1:40:55] stone that was cut out of the mountain
[1:40:57] is ready to come at any time and when it
[1:40:59] comes what does it do it does away with
[1:41:01] the Gentile age it's all over and God
[1:41:04] completely quits dealing with them let
[1:41:06] him that be filthy be filthy still and
[1:41:08] him that Holy be holy still so the
[1:41:10] Gentile church is in the leot Dean age
[1:41:12] we're at the end of the leot Dean age
[1:41:15] the Jews are in their Homeland the
[1:41:17] Gentile apostate is already taken place
[1:41:19] he says we have a president like we have
[1:41:21] we have a nation that has broke up like
[1:41:23] have we have atomic bombs hanging in the
[1:41:25] hangers we have a church that lukewarm
[1:41:27] we have a church of people that draws
[1:41:30] theirselves together we have a Ministry
[1:41:32] that patterns the ministry of Jesus
[1:41:33] Christ for to catch the stone when it
[1:41:36] comes what's left to happen it might be
[1:41:38] any minute there isn't nothing left
[1:41:40] we're at the
[1:41:42] end but we got a Time
[1:41:46] piece he said and it's time for the
[1:41:51] Rapture don't don't you remember as soon
[1:41:54] as the church goes then the Jews take
[1:41:56] hold of and it comes first the next
[1:41:57] thing is order is the mighty nation a
[1:41:59] national Revival he goes it's not a a
[1:42:01] mighty nation or a national Revival for
[1:42:03] amongst the Gentiles the next thing in
[1:42:04] order is the coming of the Kingdom the
[1:42:06] coming of Christ amen and I'm going to
[1:42:09] bring this to a close here in 1
[1:42:11] Thessalonians 4 and verse 6 the Lord
[1:42:14] himself shall descend from heaven with
[1:42:16] the shout and the voice of an archangel
[1:42:18] with the Trump of God and the dead in
[1:42:20] Christ shall rise first then they which
[1:42:22] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:42:25] together with him in the clouds to meet
[1:42:26] the Lord in the air so shall we ever be
[1:42:29] with the Lord wherefore Comfort one
[1:42:30] another with these words that word
[1:42:33] caught there is harpazo which means to
[1:42:35] take by force to catch away to plug to
[1:42:38] carry off by force to seiz to claim for
[1:42:41] oneself
[1:42:42] eagerly to snatch out of the way he goes
[1:42:46] I believe we're living in the
[1:42:49] coming days of the Lord and he goes to
[1:42:52] church
[1:42:53] has got to go completely into
[1:42:55] desperation he goes now in the end the
[1:42:58] messages see the action of the great
[1:43:00] Holy Spirit we see him come down visible
[1:43:03] among the people even taking its picture
[1:43:04] it's working and showing it's not a man
[1:43:07] it's not just a preacher it's not a
[1:43:08] certain congregation it's the Holy
[1:43:11] Spirit showing the same thing it did
[1:43:13] when it was embodied in the body of
[1:43:14] Jesus Christ now it's embodied in the
[1:43:16] body of the bride and it should throw us
[1:43:19] into desperation
[1:43:24] all
[1:43:25] church but when he comes the day of the
[1:43:28] Lord he comes with three
[1:43:31] things the Bible says in 1 Thessalonians
[1:43:34] 5:2 for yourselves know perfectly that
[1:43:36] the day of the Lord comes as a thief in
[1:43:39] the
[1:43:40] night see a thief not only he doesn't
[1:43:43] give a notice of when he's coming he's
[1:43:45] knocking on your window he's not
[1:43:46] knocking on your door he's coming in so
[1:43:49] secretly that you don't even know he's
[1:43:51] there and the coming of the Lord is so
[1:43:55] secretly that you don't know he's there
[1:43:58] for some of us we look over in Israel
[1:44:00] and we don't think anything about
[1:44:02] it but he's
[1:44:04] coming so secretly but all along he's
[1:44:07] given you signs all along he showed you
[1:44:10] she's in her Homeland you're in your
[1:44:12] Homeland I've sent you a
[1:44:14] message notice now but God has said in
[1:44:19] his word that it would be like a thief
[1:44:20] in the night coming and that would be
[1:44:23] people the people of the world think
[1:44:25] well you know it's just I got plenty of
[1:44:27] time it'll be all announced but you see
[1:44:30] it's announc but it's a secret
[1:44:33] announcing amen it's just those who are
[1:44:35] willing to hear it those who are willing
[1:44:37] to consider it those who love the Lord
[1:44:41] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:44:44] heaven notice he descends musicians can
[1:44:47] make your way
[1:44:49] back with a
[1:44:51] shout what is a shout brother the first
[1:44:53] thing that comes is he starts descending
[1:44:56] from Heaven there's a shout what is it a
[1:44:58] message right it's a message to get the
[1:45:02] people together a message comes forth
[1:45:04] first it's lamp trimming time rise and
[1:45:07] trim your lamps he said some of them
[1:45:09] found they didn't have oil in their
[1:45:11] lamps but it's lamp trimming time it's
[1:45:13] Malachi 4 time and we find the second
[1:45:17] thing happens is that there is a voice
[1:45:20] of the Resurrection the same voice loud
[1:45:22] voes in St John 11:38 that called
[1:45:25] Lazarus from the grave getting the bride
[1:45:27] together then the resurrection of the
[1:45:29] Dead Sea caught up with it see now watch
[1:45:32] the three things take place next is what
[1:45:35] a
[1:45:35] trumpet see the third thing is a trumpet
[1:45:38] which always is at the Feast of the
[1:45:40] trumpet is calling the people to a
[1:45:42] feast and that'll be the bride supper
[1:45:45] the lamb supper with the bride in the
[1:45:48] sky oh he says we're right there ready
[1:45:50] now the only thing the church is coming
