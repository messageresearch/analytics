this is the will of god even your sanctification that you shapely abstain from fornication we better be going it's time for bible study like and our parents are going to be there what is up with that yeah i guess we better head out i'm surprised you even go to that that dumb bible study the bible is just a superstitious fairy tale you know the opiate of the masses religion is a joke it's just a crutch for feeble-minded people so they can cope with the harsh reality of their meaningless lives i mean do you really believe in god if god was real why would he allow all the suffering in the world yeah yeah i think i know what you mean but our parents are gonna be there like she said and we'll be in big trouble if we don't show up they'll tell the pastor and then he'll lecture us about forsaking the gathering of ourselves together and all that it's just easier for us to go through the motions rather than to put up with all that heat you know whatever i'll see you tomorrow but whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven hey guys how's it going i haven't seen you much since you've been dating yeah well some maybe sometime we

good and to love into good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning in the end i will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death so and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that hearers say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life

of you can testify that you've been touched already in these meetings amen as we've heard this morning the devil may be telling you you've already missed your opportunity but he's lying to you if you've missed an opportunity so far you still have more opportunities but don't let it pass you by amen you know most of us have probably never been in a real courtroom during a real court trial but today we're going to take you inside of a courtroom and not just for any court trial but for the greatest trial of all time and you may be saying to yourself great right this is going to be good who is it that's on trial well it's you you're on trial today because whether you realize it or not every single day there is a great accuser who is accusing you day and night and he's bringing constant attacks and he's bringing false accusations against your claim that you are a child of god now this courtroom that we're going to go into today it's not just any old regular courtroom because it's actually located on a battlefield and then that battlefield is actually located in your mind and you fight on this battlefield constantly you fight for your rights of redemption rights of salvation rights of healing your right to be delivered you're right for the baptism of the holy ghost and we're all fighting for that body change not only are you going to see a court scene up here today but there's also going to be a church folks are going to sit in that church and they're going to watch this court scene just like you do and i believe that many of you today are going to be able to relate to the thoughts that they express as the cases play out before you today there's going to be those that will testify on your behalf and i ask you to listen closely listen with an open heart listen to the evidence and decide whether or not you will be found guilty or innocent whether you will stay stay bound up in chains or whether you will go free today ladies and gentlemen we present to you the rigged court [Applause] [Music] [Music] all rise be seated for when our man wants taste of christ do the things so early by no means he has any desire to go back into that what does he do the life paul said that i once lived i live no more yet i live not neither christ in me why he raised him from this low level of worldly sin up to a place that we ourselves can look back and see where we come from back and see where we once lived now we live different to assure us that we are dead and our lives are hitting christ through god that are sealed by the holy ghost and raised above those things then we are a lie with the same evidence that he come back with to prove to us our first case here today will be repentant sinners versus satan defendants the witness stand please place right hand on the bible do you selling this word to tell the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth so i be god i watch i'll be seated but there's no chairs okay devil state your case your honor these that are here today are sinners and should go to hell the law demands that they die what do you have to say in your defense your honor i was a sinner the devil reminds me of those days regularly i walked in darkness living a miserable ungodly life but one day a friend of mine invited me to church and i repented and was baptized in the name of our lord jesus christ just exactly like it says in acts 2 38 god filled me with the holy ghost it gave me overcoming power his precious blood is greater than all my sin and i am no longer a slave to sin or the fear of going to hell your honor i too was a sinner i wasn't even worthy to live but i repented devil and you know it because you're now under my feet the tables have turned and the sin that once ruled me i rule it now by the blood of jesus christ and it's by that blood that i am a devil defeater your honor i used to go to church but the lust for worldly pleasure and sin pulled me out and took me further than i ever wanted to go i was living a wicked and ugly life but one day in church god's amazing grace and mercy found me changed me and my life forever i have never been the same since i don't even have the desire to do those things since devil you lose again i am now filled with the holy ghost and i walk in the light thank you god for the blood objection your honor these sinners are lying now that's funny don't you know the word of god declares you to be the father of lies you're the liar satan you told me i'd gone too far and i believed you he made a wreck out of my life until one day i cried out to my god in desperation he reached way down and pulled me from your nasty grip on my life all the sins you've tried to place on my head they'll be put back on you and you're a liar and there's no truth in you that's right you're a liar [Applause] everybody just calm down chill and sit down [Music] one two three devils is it not the truth that you lied you drank smoked did drugs porn you message believers lived him poorly were rebellious and disobedient should i say more your honor we need your help we've repented of all these things help us please devil i have no remembrance of these sins objection overruled and furthermore case dismissed [Applause] me [Applause] i'm sorry to stop the rejoicing and the shouting and dancing you know how much i love that praise and worship gives you strength for war but we have another battle to win and another case to resolve then he anointed you with the holy spirit a nice place you in the body of christ each one of these davids where's the god who's the goliath brother branham that cancer's eating you up that's right that tumor that's hanging on you then cataracts on your eyes that arm everything looks at it and says it can't be done the devil said you might as well quit believing you might as well settle down because you can't never no more get well your doctor said so all the rest of them said so you can't get well but the christ stop your drinking smoking lying stealing that saves you from a life of drunkenness from rowling from sin in a devil's grave if god can do that for you he can save you from your tv and from your cancer he's like wow don't take this boat stand in the name of the lord jesus and challenging your showdown amen [Music] i feel religious our next case is divine healing and miracles versus satan will the defendants please take the stand the defendants have made false claims that god still miraculously heals the sick and delivers from demon spirits why they even line people up and pray for them they get so emotional screaming shouting running even speaking in tongues intelligent minds know that only modern science and medicine can heal the sick they're an embarrassment to the world and must be stopped smart move devil but let's hear what the defendants have to say in response to your charge your honor my defense today is my testimony of the miraculous power of god first of all i'd like to explain the definition of the word miracle a surprising and welcome event that is not explicable by natural and scientific laws and is therefore considered to be the work of a divine agency i had an autoimmune disease called alopecia which caused me to go completely bald devil you said that only intelligent minds know that medicine science can heal the sick but in my case medicine and science has no cure for alopecia you said that i would just have to live with being bald because god doesn't heal anymore but you are a liar satan do you see the hair that i have on my head today that was my god and he alone has destroyed my groove and there was nothing you can do to stop him witnesses from the audience if i may objection your honor those people are not in this skit objectionable this is not a skit this is reality defend it you may continue have any of you ever experienced in your own life or in the life of your family the supernatural healing power of god if you have please stand your feet did it make you happy and rejoice did you get emotional with thanksgiving in your heart you may be seated i would like for my mom to please stand devil do you remember her uh well she she does look a little familiar but i i can't be for certain you're lying devil you know exactly who she is you attacked her with cancer and lungs and lymph nodes she faced goliath with a victory dance around the church took the sword of god's word and cut your head off cancer-free [Applause] your honor i would like to share some of my testimony for the past year i have been bound by fear and it has held me that i can never go forward i can never get past it satan always came against me attacked my mind and told me i would never make it told me why go to heaven you're scared but you lied i went to a camp a few months ago and the lord gave me complete deliverance i'm no longer bound by that stupid fear you're trying to put on my life satan i'm free it seems you have a bad memory now i remind you of all the many challenges you and your fellow demons made here at this very camp three years ago young people bound by fear doubt depression and suicide we're all set free by the mighty name of jesus and you most assuredly lose every battle this year let me just remind you not even cancer [Applause] [Applause] your honor the infallible word of god declares that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he is still the god that heals all our diseases and the prayer of faith still saves the sick that is a promise and part of our inheritance as believers the devil has no legal right to take that away and furthermore all the devils in hell can't take it away we will not be denied [Applause] stand up you cowards [Applause] your honor and i'll do disrespect my colleagues and i find this courtroom and trial proceedings to be rigged in the defendant's favor i realize that i don't normally do this but i couldn't agree with you more but it is your claims that are false not the defendants case is missed your honor before we proceed to the final case i beg you for a recess i need to regroup and call in a few reinforcements well i honestly don't see where any more support for you would change the outcome of this trial but permission granted however you must hurry for your time is short [Applause] oh my word i can hardly believe what we've been seeing and hearing those young people are so strong and excited about serving god they're not afraid to stand up to the devil but i'm just too weak and afraid i'll never be an overcomer yeah and not only that but they claim victory over sin i mean come on i thought i'd always be a sinner that god loves me in my sin and accepts me the way i am how can you be free from sin and also how can you be sure well they talk about how the holy ghost gives them power to overcome sin and become a new creation whatever that means i've never been told that i really needed the holy ghost and i was raised in the message and went to church just like the rest of you but i never really lived a christian life oh god save me me too i just accepted jesus as my savior and i believe god's prophet but i just went on living that same old way nothing really changed i get so depressed and ashamed of the way i live i didn't even know i could really be set free oh lord i am ready to surrender well it's obvious that those dividends are free from the devil's rule and i can be too if i truly repent he will fill me with the holy ghost so that i can be an overcomer i mean just look at this insane world i don't want to be identified with it i just can't remain where i'm at anymore i have to rise up and walk towards the promises of god really i'm so sick and tired of drifting along and pretending to be a believer but yet living a hidden life of sin and shame honestly i've always believed i've gone too far i've turned that call down so many times but yet something keeps drawing me not yet now's not the time for you i guess i'll just wait what about the miraculous healings they talked about my church never has a prayer line or altar calls for that matter i know i would really like the opportunity to be prayed for and experience the healing and delivering power of god i hear about others being delivered and healed just never really believed it for myself but i do now well all i know is i want what they've got can't y'all see god's raising up a mighty army to defeat the devil and tear his kingdom down it's time we take hold of what's rightfully ours we have played around long enough and we've been believing the devil's lies for far too long this is my time hey don't just settle down and think rational just a minute they're just getting all worked up and emotional in that trial they're making you scared no need for that fanaticism you've all made a profession of faith you go to church you believe god sent a prophet that's all you need you know jesus died on the cross for your sins so just keep loving jesus do the best you can god will forgive you nobody's perfect hey y'all i think the trial's about to start again let's go back inside and watch all rise be seated did you notice what the angel said i can't do nothing till you've come hither wow message of the livers and before one speck of fire could fall from heaven locked had to get out of sodom and before one drop of rain fell from heaven noah went into the ark and before the atom bomb can strike this nation the church will go in the rapture to meet the lord jesus [Applause] and the missiles are set up and the hammers are pulled back the angels are all standing in order hallelujah the great partners of heaven is crowded full the hearts are all in tune the great bands are already packed us up there's a homecoming time pretty soon for the church of the living god who's been waiting his coming i'm so bad i'm getting so tired hold for that great hour our last case today is satan versus the rapture well satan i see you have brought some more prosecutors and accusers with you yes i have and we fully expect to convince these young people that they are guilty and will not see a rapture and who are my defendants today in this on their case your honor very well take the stand and the oath please which right hand on the bible do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth so i be god thank you satan what is your argument concerning the rapture and just for the record an argument is all you have your honor the rapture is a fairy tale a made-up fantasy and these defendants are believing false information and giving false hope to people around the world that there's a way of escape what do my defendants have to say about this your honor i'll have the devil to know that the only one here with no way of escape is him you gave us a promise of a rapture and i claim it we will be changed and rise to meet the lord but you devil will be seized and bound in chains for one thousand years only to be thrown into the lake of fire after that [Applause] do you recall what happened on calvary satan you thought that you had taken down our champion but just like our lord promised there was a resurrection and a rapture of the saints exactly what will take place again for us today you couldn't stop it then and you can't stop it now our destiny is sealed with the blood of jesus objection your honor we stop people for believing this nonsense on a regular basis we stop and divide families churches and ministries we cause people to lose their vision of this impossible dumb dream of a body change objection overruled you have never stopped one of my words from being fulfilled nor have you stopped warning my children from believing the promised word for this hour your arrogance and stupidity never ceases to amaze me defendants you may continue your honor we have been chosen and predestinated to fulfill the promised word of the hour this is the rapture age and satan does not have enough to keep us from that promise of the rapture and your word declares that we will overcome and sit with you on your throne devil you know my god can't lie [Music] your honor our focus is not on those who have fallen away we keep our eyes on jesus as we press towards the mark of the rapture this is our calling and we will keep walking until our body is changed we are an invincible army and no weapon formed against us shall prosper [Applause] no retreat [Music] so very true and well said defendants you know what that's it i'm convinced that we serve a living present god and i want all he has for me this could be my last opportunity and i'm not leaving camp the same way i came lily wait i'm going with you i refuse to listen to the devil any longer i am not turning this call down i want a new life i want the holy ghost y'all wait for me i want to surrender my life fully to jesus and i refuse to get left behind stop you know what you're asking for don't you you will be laughed at scoffed at and called a fanatic cult member you will lose all your friends listen to me you're a liar satan i'm done with you devil i'm not your slave anymore we will stop you you will fail all of you we will destroy you get out of my way you worthless creatures i can handle this i'll convince them my name is apollyon king of the bottomless pit and i have been given permission to lose thousands upon thousands of demons against this age and the bride of christ evil reigns throughout this land i have all of mankind in a state of insanity i have disease sickness calamities and war destroying the world there is simply no way of escape young people nothing awaits you but death hell and the grave you're wasting your time at this camp i'm in charge here just read the news mercy said no [Applause] know why you're mad it's because you know we're in the season for a rapture and you know you can't stop it another mighty angel has come down in revelation 10 with the message you give us faith for rapture we have seen our names written in the open book we have even been given the title to a body change and all that awaits you and your little buddies is a burning hell [Applause] your honor that ain't nothing but the truth like that right [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow that's impossible it's just impossible that can't happen to us it just can't be he said we would win that ain't looking too good for us you lied to us you said we would defeat these young people you're a liar well i mean so are you you're all liars too right that's just what we do yeah you're a liar you couldn't keep those young people from believing neither could you lousy devil you turned out to be hey don't talk to my friend like that those are fine words well what are we waiting for [Applause] pick them up and stand them before me goodbye devil you have been conquered the gates of hell shall not prevail [Applause] you have come here today with accusations against my bride i don't take kindly to those who lie about and run down my wife miss jesus christ however this has given these redeemed young people the opportunity to declare victory over you and all your schemes you have been soundly defeated by the holy ghost-filled young people who know their god this court has reached a verdict to all those accused i pronounce you not guilty on all accounts and to you demons of darkness i banish you from this youth camp and sentence you to everlasting destruction in the lake of fire now throw them out of here [Applause] [Applause] well done brian you have been set free

the baptism of the holy ghost he said taste dismiss you can have it because the word said you can have it oh hey man as they were going over that skit this quote kept coming into my mind i looked it up brother branham says he says when he becomes both judge jury and the attorney he pleaded our case we found guilty by his own law and he come and took the guilty person's place that was in the sanctuary he took his sin he took it upon himself and died and he paid the price and shed his blood and gave back his own token his own life why we are perfect the case is dismissed there is no more sin to the believer amen he says oh god have mercy if the people can see that there is no more case he that heareth my words and believeth he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life and shall not come to the judgment but has passed from death unto life there's the case you've passed from death unto life he said there's the case case dismissed no more case to it amen amen oh what's the devil been telling you what lies he didn't putting over your family what cancers you've been putting over your family what anxiety what change today we declare to you case dismiss into red court we can't lose we can't lose hallelujah why would we retreat why would we turn back when we already had the answer oh he says i've released millions and millions and millions of demons into this age yeah and god let all the forces of pharaoh gather at the red sea what was it brother ronnie there's a setup it's a set up he's let them all into this age why because those ones that devil that's been tormenting you that one that's been holding you down the tears you've cried at night the tormentor you see today you will see no more forever hallelujah hey the prison doors open the prison door's open it was a governor that came down to that boy and offered him a pardon and he didn't accept it there's way more than a governor here today there's way more than any president here today but the king of kings and the lord of lords says they don't even have to go to trial case dismissed you don't even have to stand before the judgment and it's up to you prison doors open case dismissed you can be free [Music] you are free you are free i've heard brother joe say it many times will you just take one step just take one step prison doors open you can't be held [Music] every right he ever had was stripped that day on cap [Music] there's still time in this camp meeting there's still time this weekend there's still time right now you got something that's been holding you you want to be free from it why wait there's ministers in the building right now you want to be free from i'm telling you the doors are open the doors are open and there's a voice telling you walk out walk out step out of that prison don't stay there any longer he's sitting there telling you wait a little longer wait a little longer wait a little longer how much more time do we have

out of it today you got to be willing you got to be willing to move he did his part he did his part he stripped the devil at calvary he sent a message in this day once again to show you night after night after night after night that the devil has no power he's a toothless lion he's got a bow and no arrows he can't hold you he can't defeat you you are overcomers why is he in your ear why is he lying to you the prophet of god would say because he knows that if they ever get the true revelation of who they are what they they can do the greater works he knows so he's got to keep you from knowing he tries to keep you from knowing because he said once they know they will be not might be i hope they'll be they will be an invincible army where's that army at brother aaron i'm looking at it you are that invincible army you know who you are you know where you has placed you in a are of power satan is a defeated being he is a lower being and he's been placed under your feet pace dismissed case dismissed as we approach the service tonight once again you're going to see a miracle you're gonna see a man stand up here and preach [Music] that's supposed to be dead you're gonna be minute by dead man tonight that was their testimony [Music] but my god still showing up at the tomb of every lazarus he's still rolling stones away and as much as i appreciate the miracle in brother ron spencer's life what about your miracle what about your moment you walk in here tonight walk in knowing the case is dismissed there is now no condemnation that over you holding over because he knows if you ever find out for yourself he can't stop you he knows that the case has been dismissed and now you know come tonight with that attitude nothing's going to hinder me nothing's going to stop me maybe jesus has went on by and he's down the road a little bit prophet of god said there's no way jesus hurt him with these ears the mob was too loud the mob was too loud brother brandon described it as him throwing fruits and vegetables and hollering and screaming you know sometimes people may think you get a little too pentecostal a little out of order all i know is bartimaeus got so loud that in the middle of a riot they asked him to calm down he got so loud he was screaming some of a riot in the middle of a mob they said this guy's out of order but he said this is my moment this is my one chance he's passing by forever jesus jesus there was a desperation will you come tonight with desperation will you come tonight saying jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and my need in my moment in my time of desperation the case has been dismissed but he's got to hear your voice say i accept it i accept it will you accept it today be accepted as we go before him in prayer now heavenly father lord lord only you could wipe away my sins lord only you can heal my body lord only you could give it wretch like me lord clean me up and give me the baptism of the holy ghost only
