prayer father we come to you today just asking that you would come once again and speak to our hearts Lord and touch us Lord in our lives father we have need of you cuz we are truly needful of you Lord and no matter how long we've served you no matter how long we've been along the road in this gospel Lord we still need you and need you more than ever before in this world that we're living in because it's seemingly every moment getting darker and darker and going deeper and deeper and Insanity Lord but Lord we want to be one that's counted worthy to escape the things that are upon coming upon this Earth Lord commit Lord everything to be said and done For Your Glory and Honor you would lift our spirits up you'd lift our hearts up to serve you to take another step to encourage someone we pray in Jesus name amen amen let's turn to Luke 8 and verse 22 amen Luke 8 and verse 22 said now it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a ship with his disciples and he said unto them let us go over unto the other side of the lake and they launched forth but as they sailed he fell asleep and there came down a storm of wind on the lake and they were filled with water and were in Jeopardy and they came to him and awoke him saying master master we perish then he arose and rebuked the winds and the Raging of the waters and they ceased and they were calm and he said unto them where is your faith and they being afraid wondered saying one to another what manner of man is this for he commandeth even the winds and Waters and they obey him amen let you be seated just like to speak to you this evening on Faith's decree decree is an official order issued by a legal Authority it's official order issued by a legal Authority you know the song says and I I was listen listening to a tape and heard brother brandham sing this or quote it there's the song you know when they ring those golden bells for you and me said there's a land beyond the river that we call all the sweet forever and we only reach that Shore by Faith's decree and we will only reach that sweet Forever by Faith's decree and what what is Faith decree it is the word of God it is not my word or my wishes or what I want or what I might say but it is the word of God and because he has spoken it we will reach that Shore just as disciples as he would tell them let us go into the other side and then when they begin to quit he didn't tell them about what was coming you know God doesn't do that he doesn't always tell you about the things you're going to go through but he said let's go to the other side that was actual a decree let's go to the other side of the lake and and if they would have took him at what he said they would have known that no matter what come or what went on or what happened they were going to make it to the other side and so we will only reach that place that is so that place is that is so impossible to describe with the these human limited abilities we we haven't been there and even if we did go there for a moment and come back it would still be hard to describe the grander and the beauty that awaits a Believer who goes to that place and and that's just a portion of what awaits us amen but you but you will only see it by living by faith speaking by faith speaking Faith decree and facei decree is a decree it's official order given by a legal Authority it's the the decree is the word of God it's the word of God that's what faith speaks that's where Faith Finds Its place to rest you know Faith always looks to the word that's the only stable place faith can find to rest upon amen Faith places itself upon the unmovable Rock that's God's Eternal Word Faith doesn't look at reason I don't care how much you can show it we be better or something else would be more realistic if the word says no faith rests right there if the word says yes Faith rest right there that is the sanctuary of Faith's resting place now a place of rest is a place of stability now I I don't know if you where where you like to find places of rest but you want a place where you feel safe and you feel that things around you are okay and everything's you know for a moment that you can get some rest you want to lay down in that place amen I I I I I look at some of these people that go and sleep on a on a side of a cliff hanging out and they want to see that I I don't care nothing about being there because that's not someplace I think I can get some rest but I want to be in my own bed or a place that I feel like amen there's a safe place where I can close my eyes and just rest and what in the night and I that's how faith it looks for a place amen not on things that are unstable which is our reasonings or our own thoughts or our own thinking but it looks for a place where it can just close its eyes of the whatever the word says it it just takes what the word says if it says yes it's yes if it says no it's no and it just rests right there upon that you know I I've been looking I've been learning some things there at home turn with using the lathe and something struck me the other day as I was turning I I you know I made pens some of y'all have seen some of those saying and and you know have a little block of wood spinning around at a high rate speed is not all that scary you got a face shield on or whatever it's just a little small piece that you make a pen out of but then I decided you know I I want a bigger lathe and I I want want to make bigger things and make bowls or whatever and so I I just thought well man if I can make a pen I can make a bowl but it's a whole lot of whole lot of difference between the two one the wood that's spinning around it's not just just like that it's woo woo woo and you're looking at this wood and you don't want that thing coming off and slinging you and hit you in the face and the tools are different that you use but there's something That Remains the Same that with whatever size of Lathe or whatever thing that you you you whatever size that you use there's one thing that's Remains the Same is called the rest and and it's a place where you can place your tool upon and you can turn it wherever you want it and maneuver it from that place but if that tool is not on that rest then you're going to be in a world of hurt there's going to be wood flying there's going to be things that are how they get a catch as they call it and those things are very scary I've got a few of them because why I realized I didn't have that tool in the place where it was supposed to be I was trying on my own abilities to do something but if I would just lay that tool upon the rest and just move it across on that rest and it would carve it right out and I got to thinking about that as I was watching it take place before my eyes because I watch you know watched a lot of YouTube and trying to figure it out and and and and watching watching something and doing something's two totally different things but as I begin to do it I begin to realize if I turn it this way but as long as I keep that thing on that rest then it's really not my personal ability to hold it or to do it but it's on the rest and on there it can cut the wood as it's supposed to do and I thought God if we can just keep ourself upon our rest and that is the word of God then when we come across hard times or we come across things that we don't know how to handle and it seems to be going woo woo woo in our life amen if we just lay there upon the rest God will carve that out God will move it God will change it amen because we but we have to be say centered in that place of rest and that place of rest is only the word of God it's not a good book it's not a it's not somebody's thoughts or somebody's thinking it's only on what God has declared now you you can rely on Hope but you know if you just rely on hope you know what hope is Hope is something that puts something out further out there somewhere brother BR talks about he said when you rely on Hope You Hinder Faith he said hope is something that's looking for something way off but Faith looks at it as right now Faith said God says so and it's mine amen that settles it I don't care if I'm still crippled if I'm still blind if I'm still sick they don't have nothing to do with it I believe it anyhow it's mine to have God said it and it's settled that's Faith Hope says what God said so and I'm expecting to get it somewhere somehow someday but as long as Satan can put you off on to another day he'll just keep that going on day after day after day and you'll never get it but if you'll just believe it's right now now my personal property faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen Faith acts right now it's positive he said I tell you sickness and everything else when Faith steps in it just like snowballs on a hot stove everything else just melts away because faith has come and took its place of rest faith has rested upon the word of God When Faith speaks every else keeps still these old sicknesses this Burling around like this and saying days of Miracles are pass or you might get it another day but let Faith Step Up R time and pull its muscles back and say I'm here to take over he said I tell you the rest of them things will keep still When Faith does that that's the fellow we want to deal with that's Faith amen we want faith we don't want just hope we don't want to just hope so or hope God might do it or hope maybe to happen we want to believe that God's already said it it's already already done it's already finished and I can have it right now that's what my faith is declaring the word of God Amen how do we get faith faith comes by hearing hearing what the word of God Amen that's right you can base it on nothing else but the word of God but you know faith has a voice faith has a voice amen it's a declaration that has to there's there's a difference between a declaration and a decree if you'll study the two words amen there's there the faith has a voice it has to actually declare what the word has said amen Matthew 17 would say Jesus would say if you have faith you shall say to this mountain not look at the mountain not come the next day and look at the mountain but say to the mountain you shall say I love how he put it he didn't say go get you a preacher and say or go get a prophet and say but he said if you have faith you can say to this mountain be thou removed see the action of Bible faith is speaking the word of God the decree and standing on that statement of faith amen Jesus said if you have faith you will speak well there's no no such you know there's no such a thing as silently believing I'll say that again there's no such a thing as just silently believing amen what you believe will come out amen if you don't have enough confidence to say yet you really don't believe it that's just the it's in the word John Luke chapter 17 the Lord said if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you might say to this sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the root and be planted in the sea and it should obey you Matthew 21 again says if you have faith and don't doubt if you say to this mountain it shall happen so according to Jesus for Faith to operate it must be released through spoken words words amen it must be released through spoken word what you speak is the evidence of your faith come on somebody another word of say another way of saying it is your speech reveals what you truly believe your speech reveals what you truly believe it says in 2 Corinthians 4 it says but having the same Spirit of Faith according to what is written I believe therefore I spoke we also believe therefore we also o speak amen so if you believe you will therefore speak amen there will be a declaration it will be something a voice speaking against that sickness and speaking against that enemy and speaking against that doubt and speaking against that fear and what is not speaking your own thoughts or what you think ought to happen but what the word of God says therefore I can look at sickness and say by his stripes I am healed because it is a decree written by almighty God and given for me to declare Luke Luke 64 verse 4 45 says a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil Treasure of heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh amen he would look at the uh uh the Pharisees he said in Matthew 12:34 he said oh generation of vipers how can you be evil speaking good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and the evil man out of the evil treasure bring forth evil things but I say unto you that Every Idle Word that a man shall speak they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words Thou Art Justified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned so it was very simple teaching Amen in the scriptures that our words have power it's the whole sermon in itself our words have power the life and death in the tongue we you can either Speak Life or you can speak death you can speak your justification or you be justified by what you speak or you can be condemned by the words that you speak so you can look at the word at the thing that you're going through and if you'll look and speak the word of faith amen decree that is given there then you will be justified it will you will come come out of that thing but if you don't and you begin to look and all you can see and speak is your symptoms and and your problems and the situations around you and all the negativity around you you will be condemned amen why because out of your mouth power comes forth you speak what you believe in your heart now of course you can pretend and lie you know and say anything that's not what I'm talking about but when when you speak sometime you know people I'll just say it when you put your guard down and you speak spontaneously without thinking you will say what you believe in your heart oh yeah you'll say what you believe in your heart you know a lot of people say well I ain't got no filter well hey man some people need to get a get a think of man's filter amen Romans 10 ver8 say but what sayith that the word is n thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thy heart that God has raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation so with your mouth speaking amen my man heart the heart man believeth under righteousness and the mouth is conf confessing that I'm saved I'm delivered I I'm set free I I'm not bound no more I my chains are broke amen I I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not that old man no more that's not who I am no more he's dead now amen you start declaring the decree of God and God brings the the power to bind that enemy in your life where is the word of faith Faith well we just read it it's in the heart and in the mouth for Faith to work properly it must come from both places when you believe in your heart what you believe in your heart must be expressed through your mouth for it to produce salvation means Deliverance so this is the way scriptures tell people can be delivered and set free believing and then speaking with their mouth amen that's why it's important Amen to even respond to the word of God that's saying you agree with it and it's Faith amen amen that's what what happened to hadie right it was her response that released the power if she'd have sat there like a bump on the log and said well that's a pretty good story man that's quite quite quite Grand but that's not her attitude she was listening she believed this man's a Prophet this man has thus sayth the Lord and he's not going to lie to me and she's sitting there and she hears this amazing story of squirrel World being created listen if you don't believe that you might as well not even believe in God cuz God can do the impossible God is still the Creator he's still the same yesterday today and forever he can still provide when there ain't no Provisions he can still heal when there ain't nothing but sickness around you he can still do impossible things amen if we can believe and here she is this is nothing but the truth and it costs God to move on her behalf what did what she spoke out of her mouth come on somebody we want God to do things we want God to move and we just sit there and just watch it all we ain't we ain't we ain't here to be bystanders sitting on the sidelines what will be will be I tell you no sir we are to put the word of God in our mouth speak against that enemy not what I think but what God has said God has said he shall and Satan shall be bruised under your feet God spoke that what do you say in Matthew 16 and verse 13 Jesus is with the disciples and he asked the question whom whom does men say that I am I the son of man am and they said well some say you know John the Baptist some Elias some jeremi I one or one of the prophets that's okay good but who do you say that I am and Simon Peter answered said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and now notice his response and what comes from the response blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood is not revealed this unto thee but my Father which is in heaven that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not Prevail against it and now we know the Catholic teaching is that that's Peter that the church is built on but the rock is the rock of Revelation and he heard and he spoke and from that Revelation came amen as he spoke the word of God came this I will give to thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven Faith spoke and power was released amen Faith the Creed and power was loosed to bind and to loose listen God's not interested in who what you think everybody else thinks about him God's not interested in what you think everybody else thinks about this service tonight God's interested in what you think he's wantan to know what do you say who do you say that I am who who well I tell you I he's he's God I saw him I saw in Sister Lanta man she test she got a great testimony that's wonderful we we tell it all the time it is a great testimony but God wants to know what you say about him not what sister at Lanta says about him or sister so and so or brother so and so or whoever he wants to know what do you who do you say that I am well I tell you this is just a B I tell you what you are you're just you're just a bunch of church work up that's what you are is that really what you think about it no I believe believe you are the Christ the son of the Living God and you have come down in this generation to show yourself that you are the sa yesterday today and forever that you still heal that you still deliver that you still set free that you still do all of these things that you've done from the beginning cuz you're still God that's who I believe you are he would say it like this Jesus Christ is in the building tonight to perform Miracles praise the Lord he but he does it through his church his people you know he didn't say through his prophet and he did do it through his Prophet but he said through his church his people they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover in my name they shall cast out evil spirits that is a commission that is a decree I didn't make that decree you didn't make that decree there ain't no man on this Earth that's red letter decree so if you got a problem with that decree you got a problem with the one who made it come on somebody amen people want to have a problem with this listen it's it's the the the last commission the last decree given to the church they shall cast out devils and today message preachers are making fun of that you know why cuz they're scared of it but give me a man that ain't scared of a devil that can recognize him when he rises up and say devil you ain't got no right holding this child of God come out of him in the name of Jesus Christ amen listen it's real it's the the things that we're going through is the last commission the last decree given to the Church of the Living God he wouldn't say cast out Devils if it wasn't going to be no Devils to cast out he wouldn't lay say lay hands on the sick if there wasn't going to be no sick to lay hands on come on somebody amen he wouldn't have said none of that if it wasn't going to be he it was a decree it was a word just just as let's go to the other side if you knew positionally who you are and what you are tonight he said there wouldn't be a feeble person in the next five minutes hello somebody well why is this got to be just 60 years ago you know why because we put it 60 years ago if we know our position and who we are there'll not be a feeble one in the next five minutes come on now that's the kind of he's the same yesterday today and forever that's who I believe he is he said you're looking off to the Millennium for something to happen when it's already here now we are sons of God that is a decree now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that is a decree not we will be we are right now right now this very minute we're seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen you need to tell that devil right now I am a Son of God right now I am a daughter of God you can't make no decree over my life any longer matter of fact devil your power is broken 2,000 years ago you cannot have one more say over my life my God that can only decree what he wants over my [Applause] life if you would only recognize that the supreme authority that Jesus Christ is given to every Prophet no that ain't what he said he said the the supreme authority Jesus Christ has given to every believer how many Believers we got the supreme authority Jesus Christ has given to every believer anything you have desire of need of only thing you have to do is ask and you'll receive it yes sir do you know how much peace you'll have tonight if you'll just go home and rest on that right there I ask it and I'm going to get it Heen cuz my my father's not some evil man and when I ask him for bread he's going to give me a stone no if I ask for healing he going to give me healing if I ask for Joy he going to give me joy if I ask for peace he's going to give me peace if I ask for my family well they'll give me that cuz it's in the word of God rest upon the word going back to Turning wood I've look I've watched it and if you don't get that thing on that rest P properly you talking about a lot of Racket it's get scary I mean I'm telling you it's a little different with a big old piece of wood whirling around your face than it is from a little pin blank that ain't nothing you don't even think about it but I I mean you must have mess up and watch videos of accidents then you probably wouldn't never do it because the people that either got too confident in themselves and their abilities and they made the wrong move and they snapped something slung it all things can kind of happen you got to you got to stay on that rest or otherwise it's and all kind of stuff can go on get all squirly really quick that do not sound like us when we get off of the place of rest and we get on our own abilities and our own thoughts and our own thinking and you know hello our own emotions and we got we tearing up wood and stuff everywhere stuff's flying everywhere why cuz we got off our place of rest there's only one place of believer can rest that's on his word you know what them disciples should have done if they saw him sleeping they should have been sleeping he said let's go to the other side you know what he does goes back there and lays down and goes to sleep he's tired he's resting and they're up there paddling you know and next thing you know they're talking about you it went really quick from them talking about a good testimony and all the things that they had son seen and the Miracles and the signs and the Wonders and all sudden man you feel feel that wind it just changed wow and the way all a sudden there boat sinking wait a minute how quickly they forgot he said let's go to the other side and then when he gets up and he and he makes the wave this is what bounds me he makes the waves and everything cease and they Marvel and they're afraid and they're like are you kidding me how do what kind of man is this well he's the same kind of man that just fed 5,000 he's the same man that just opened the eyes they witnessing all kind of Miracles that taking place water in the wine all kinds of things we don't understand the authority we have to use the word the rest to have peace in our lives to not get so stirred up brother Tim been on that I I'm not trying just part of this well I will I mean that that was that was I tell you I think about that all the time going up there and the angel says not your time to come yet go back and rest more well I can tell you what I told him I said well you doing too much you need to go out to the lake and you know what I did I texted all the three sisters I said look this a dream dad had this ain't good just being open and honest right now this ain't good church then Sunday he comes and says it ain't about resting and I and I'd been actually thinking some of those things but I I thought well he just he still needs it I don't care he needs it you know brother Brown talks about it said ain't rested at a seashore and all that I mean all that listen you can take a hundred vacations and still come back War slap out worried and fretting and carrying on how many times have you ever come home from a vacation wanting to go back on needing a vacation from your vacation wore out and tore up and you come back and it's still reality still know this and know that and this going on that's happening and you're still all tore up but if you can get to the place of true rest this is what a Believer has at their fingertips true rest when you see Darkness around you rest amen when you see all the people tore up and and ships on the coast and and all of this stuff going on and you know it's about to happen just rest you know why I can rest cuz he promised there's a body change coming it's a decree it ain't my decree I didn't say it I ain't made it up God said it and the same God who fed the 5,000 the same God who healed the lame the same God that made the lame walk and the blind SE the same one that come in this generation and the declare I am here it's the same God that's going to change these bodies one morning I can't make it happen but I can rest in his word which has he asked a question which has the greatest Authority an angel from heaven or an angel in the pull pit the angel at the pull pit Direct quote Paul said if an angel from heaven comes and preaches any other gospel to you than this which I've already preached let him be a cursed so the angel Anointed with the Holy Spirit and the word stands next to God that's right in heaven his authority all powers in Heaven and Earth is given to my hand go and I'll go with you whatsoever you bind on Earth I will bind in heaven whatsoever you loose on Earth I will Loos in heaven and notice how he goes he said if the great holy church only realized its power to do this these things and notice they didn't just leave it with the clergy amen but if the great holy church only realized his power to do these things there's no such there would be no not so but there's so much doubt and fear and trembling wondering if it will could it happen as long as that exists the church will never stand upright and when every talk of fear is vanished and the Holy Spirit is in complete control of the church then all fears are gone and that P church has the poy why they have everything that heaven owns behind them oh Jesus help me help me behave they have everything that heaven Bel owns behind them all power that heaven has is behind them why because they are ambassadors of the throne an ambassador of Christ has the authority and everything that Christ owned belonged to that Ambassador he said go ye into the world you are my Witnesses after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and what is a witness it is an ambassador it is to come and witness something the whole the whole powers of Heaven is right in your hands that's right he said the church is baring we just sit dormant it's because we don't recognize these things well I'm going to tell you right now if I was a dis disciple I'd know who he you'd be just like those disciples were CU you're doing the same thing now we don't really truly recognize what God has done among us who we got in our boat you know who's in our boat the one that heals cancer the one that could create eyeballs ask you what color you want amen The God Who can multiply amen the fishes and the loaves create squirrels amen save children that's who's in our boat this message amen we we haven't went off without Jesus I mean you can you can study it brother brother Tims went over about the two stories of one that he came walking to him one that he was in the boat some went off without him he said but some went with him but just just forgot who he was he's with us he's around us he's moving Among Us God help us to recognize who you are in this day oh it's easy to recognize him back 60 years ago or 2,000 years ago some of you probably watched The Chosen and laughed at the disciples like how could they be that blind Meanwhile we're suffering with our own blindness Christ is the head of the body wherever the head is the body's with it wherever My head goes it my body's with it where Jesus is the church is with him he don't get out of his word he stays in his word he watches over to make sure it comes to pass his church is with him and look what you say with brother brandom I'm the least one that's the souls of his feet but remember he triumphed with you he triumphed with you over every bit of it even The Souls of his feet even The Souls of his feet you might feel insignificant tonight you might feel like you're the least on the totem pole and you're the last of the last of the last every sickness every devil even death itself is under you amen even death itself is under you you say well I don't feel like I've got all of that but it's the truth it's a decree and when he put his foot down if you're the bottom of his foot every devil is under you Hallelujah I say God put your foot down tonight put it down on cancer put it down on diseases Among Us put it down on family issue put it down on what's holding our children put it [Applause] down you said brother BR might have no power he said neither do I well I'm a weakly so am I but I'm not dependent on my strength it ain't my strength I'm depending on my authority that's been given me I'm not strong I'm he's strong I'm his talks about the policeman's you know cars running up down Louisville Highway zoom zoom zoom 60 M hour and he ain't got nothing he's a little old bitty guy might be you know what he say 10 and something pounds soaking wet he said but there's enough power to stop every car why because of the authority that's been given him it ain't his power it ain't what he can do if he stepped out there it would demolish him but let him raise his hand under and be being dressed in that power and that Authority with that badge every driver recognizes that uniform brother they recognize it breaks look it's his authority why because the whole system of the city is behind him the law enforcement is behind him the mayor is behind him now that was 60 years ago it ain't so anymore seems like but what that's what the devil's doing he's trying to pollute things he's the natural look at it look at it now you can't even use that quote well let me tell you something devil God's still behind us he ain't no fickle mayor fickle Town counsel that'll turn with every kind of thing that wants to blow through a town and every kind of thought that the devil can put forth he ain't he ain't bwing down to know that devil every Power in heaven is still behind the Bride of Jesus Christ every Power Of Heaven is still behind you tonight he ain't turned and walked away from you he ain't defunding you come on somebody he hasn't defunded this bride thank you Lord he hasn't defunded this bride he hasn't strip one ounce of power away from her she still has the same Authority she did in the first church age that's right in the first church age read about it they cast out Devils they healed the py the lame man walked people were giv back their families and families were restored amen why because of the power that was in the church that power is still in the church it has been restored in this hour that we're living in we have the same Authority that they have we have the same power to use that they have we have the same blood we have every Power Of Heaven behind you tonight there ain't a devil that has a right to stand before the Church of the Living God hallelujah you need to look at that devil and say stop he ain't going to stop because of you he going to stop because what's standing behind you cuz behind you is a same angel that came to Peter it's the same angel that came to William bradam it's the same Angel that's in this building and you have the right to throw up your hand and say stop Devil youve Went far enough Hallelujah we have been dressed by the word of God we have the badge the right the authority he is not taking one ounce away he is not taking one dollar if I can say that away not one I mean notice what has happened in those cities amen that they've defunded the police crime is risen people running in and out of homes and in and out of apartment stores taking what they want doing what they want why cuz they took away the power that protected them come on somebody that's why we as a message church and a message movement need to be careful that we don't defund the police who is the police it's the Holy Ghost amen who's the power it's the Holy Ghost amen we got to make sure he's in full operation full Freedom full abilities we ain't limiting him at all if he wants to drop in this building and save everybody I say so be if he wants to drop in this building and heal everybody I say so be Let It Be unto me according to Thy word hallelujah let there be a release from your heart devil I'm not taking your nonsense no more you're not walking in and out of my house like you've been and like you've been doing you're not coming in my room you're not coming in my car this is mine it's a decree given to me by almighty God all Devils slam their brakes Hallelujah I hear cancer slamming the brakes woo I hear depression slamming his brakes suicide just slammed on his brakes why cuz it's not welcome in this street it's not welcome in this path straight and narrows away devil you're not welcome in this [Applause] P when you're raised in sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the devil recognizes that every slides its breaks when them hands go up you know why cuz he remembers the last time hands went up and they were nailed to a cross he thought he did that that he didn't do that the word decreed it the word said it would hang Between Heaven and Earth the word said it would be a lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world and here he's thinking he's doing this ha I got him just like I did every prophet and he puts some hands up but when them hands went up and that voice spoke out it is finished Oh Glory right there cancer was finished sugar diabetes was C it was was cancelled it was over withed right there drugs was finished right there pain was finished right there kind of pressure was finished why cuz he said it was he decreed it was in Matthew 8 and verse 5 Jesus goes to Capernaum the centor Centurion came to him begging for his help this is Amplified saying Lord my servant is laying her home paralyzed with intense and terrible torment and pain and Jesus well I'll come and heal him Centurion replied and said Lord I'm not worthy to have you come under my roof but only say the word my servant will be healed for I am a man subject to authority of higher rank with soldiers subject to me say go and he goes come come and he comes to my slave do this and he does it when Jesus heard this he was amazed and said to those which were follow I truthfully tell you I have not found such great faith as this with anyone in Israel I say to you many Gentiles will come from the East and the west and will sit down and feast at the table and enjoy God's promises with Abraham Isaac Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven because they accepted me as their savior I think that was a decree I'm I'm 100% sure that was a decree red letter check red red letter words again I'm not saying black letter words ain't but just understand what I'm saying I say to you that many Gentiles will come from east and west and the South and the North and will sit down and feast at the table and enjoy God's promises Hallelujah with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven because they accept me as their savior while the sons and hirs of the Kingdom the descendants of Abraham who will not recognize me as Messiah will be thrown into the outer Darkness into that place which which is farthest removed from the kingdom and there will be weeping and sorrow and pain and grinding of teeth and distress and anger and Jesus said to the Centurion go and it will be done for you as you have believed now I'm just going to say it because I I was studying this The Chosen just put that out and I thought they did a really good job at it that man heard them words and he went prepared for a party he started buying gifts buying food he went home he blowed out all the scandals to his gods and his wife comes running says oh you you ought to heard what's happening he said I already know hallelujah amen if there can be faith of that kind of man tonight that I say I already know what he said what he said is going to happen what he said is going to be and what he said is already done it doesn't matter matter what goes on in here and there and there I'm preparing for a party of Victory I'm preparing Amen to shout and give God praise cuz I know it's already finished it doesn't matter what I see around me it doesn't matter what anybody else says it only matters what he has said too many are listening to Satan's lies and he's putting them as decrees over their life and they're not decrees unless you allow them to be so hello somebody because his words is not thus sayith the Lord there's thus saith Satan and he is a liar and the prince of liars matter of fact what he says to you you might as well take exactly opposite if he say you're not Overcomer that's probably meaning you're whooping his tail all over the place if he's telling you that you're still sick and you're worse and you'll never get well that's probably because he already knows it's done it's finished but he's trying to get you to believe his lie but if you'll cast that down and realize that's not a decree because that is not given by somebody that has authority over me he has lost all of his Authority he has lost all of his ability he has no rights he's nothing but a bluff he said I like the attitude of the Centurion he was a man that felt unworthy he said as long as you feel Unworthy of a blessing you're asking you're pretty apt to get it he said but when you get to the place where you think that God owes it to you that's when you're mistaken we're in debt to God not God in debt to us we're indebted to God this Roman Italian whatever he was he said Lord I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof neither thought I worthy to come face you in other words I sent your church to meet you and ask you these questions but I have faith I know that you're a man of Authority for I'm a I'm a man of authority I speak in his son I say to this one he goes this one he stays whatever he said I'm a man that can say these things you go do it it happens and he knew that that was a Son of God and that every sickness and every demon was under him and all all he had to do is speak the word not pray speak the word that's all and it would be done because every demon would have to obey him do you believe that tonight how many believes that every demon will obey God it has to how many believe that tonight everything obeys God how many believes that tonight and everything will obey you if you have faith wow finishing this thought he would come and he would speak on the restoration of the Bride tree and he' talk about restoration means to bring back to restore the claim a claim can be enforced and bring back to his rightful owner where it belongs some way it went away from somehow it went away from the rightful owner and can wander around but to restore for is to bring it back to who it really owns it and bring it back to its right estate where it was at the first time bring it back to its right condition in order to do this we have to have we have the right to enforce if there's a law to enforce the rightful condition of restoration to restore like if somebody stole property and they're holding property captive when you take the law and go to this person and the law will enforce this person to restore this property back to his natural owner you notice how the devil was doing I've said it before like talking about the police now he's giving squatters more rights than people actually own the place in the natural so if it's happened in the natural you know he's trying to do it in the spiritual well you got to you can't just kick anybody out you and you have the pl you have the deed to the place you have the rights to the place and these people ain't got no rights they're just sitting there on what's rightfully yours and in this time and place that we're living in in some places getting to be more and more you go there and you cannot kick them out the law cannot make them move that's amazing and the devil wants to come in the time that we're living in and say he don't have to move he wants to sit there on a god-given right a god-given decree I listen your healing is god-given it's a god-given right because it's a god-given decree amen your deliverance and your salvation is a god-given right enforce it we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us for God has a law yeah he has a law and his word is the law and God and His word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Satan and say give it back give it back he has to do it because can't take God's agent the Holy Spirit and go right down on our knees and say this thus sayith the Lord he's got to give it up because the holy spirit's there to make him do it the law of the land is to enforce Is by The Land by the law of the the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan to give back what he unrightfully deceitfully taken from us by and and Souls of men he took and Souls of women and children hello somebody May by unrightfully and deceitfully taken from God Souls of men he took Souls of women and children sickness of the body he's placed upon people where God made them in the image to be like him and the church has given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and to enforce this claim upon their rights I believe I just quoted he said in the last meeting not sure but a brother from Louisville Come and Talk talks about the stolen car where they had come and the man had stole it big racket that was going on stealing cars and they're still doing that today painting them and such and so they were having a terrible time and we got down on our knees now Jesus wouldn't have had to do that for he was the word now we're not the word so we get down on our knees he said the word of the Lord came to the prophets and they wasn't the word but the word came to them but Jesus was the word you see he didn't have to pray he was God himself but we are His prophets his servants who the word of the Lord comes to and we pray and we had scripture where Jesus said whatsoever two or three two or more gathered in my name they agree I'll be in their midst and if they agree touching any certain thing and ask and don't doubt it shall be given what they ask amen what was he doing he was invoking the decree amen and here they were this man had unrightfully taking what was his not his and taking this brother's car we got on our knees about five men together four or five we nailed down and I pleaded this case before God and I took the Word of Promise and I sent it forth Hallelujah I sent it forth and that great Holy Spirit as he took the word to serve the summons a vision broke and I saw a man going toward Bowling Green Kentucky with a yellow shirt on driving this truck and the Holy Spirit came upon Him condemned him for what he' done and he turned he was about halfway and he turned around and I saw him come back and park that car on a certain street over the river there and I raised up and said told the brother that thus sayith the Lord and when they started out they went on the road and there was sitting there half empty with gasoline with a tank half 50 where had been filled up just enough to take him halfway to Bowling Green and bring it back these men are sitting right here this morning as a witness what was it in forcing giving it back what was God doing he he ain't necessarily I mean yeah he's concerned about everything in our life and he's concerned somebody stole our car yes but he's more concerned about your children that car has no Eternal value that car is going to one day probably even a day you can't even find a scrap of it it's probably gone by now it might be might be an antique somebody's got sitting on the shower room but one day it's going to be gone but God would return that back he was showing if I can do that I'll bring you children back let me tell you vision's broke tonight amen there's children that's being held unrightfully the devil has deceitfully deceived them and they're sitting in places they don't belong but if we'll grab this cup full of blessings and just send them forth and pray tonight God you see our children you see the prodical we ask Lord that you bring them back in the name of Jesus amen the holy spirit will go to where they're at I don't care if they're in a barroom or they out on the floor drunk are they out there doped up are they just out so far out they don't even believe in God no more and they might be a good citizen but they have totally walked away from God there is a power that is strong enough there is an enforcer in this building that has a right if somebody say hey devil turn my child loose turn my wife loose turn my husband loose turn it loose in the name of Jesus Christ you cannot have them it's my god-given [Applause] rights Satan's robbed you maybe of a privilege of being a son or daughter of God you have a right to be one just what this morning by the Holy Spirit to enforce that claim of God if he Afflicted you and made you sick you have a right before God to enforce the laws of God by his stripes I am healed bring it back turn it loose you're taking him out yonder to death we claim him bring him back that is that that that's enforcement restore it back to his natural condition man sick baby sick woman sick they're out of their natural condition maybe you're away from God you're out of your natural condition because you were born and formed to be in the image of God well said well brother brother Timothy I mean I've been through a lot of problem situations I'm not worthy neither was this man he said it I ain't worthy for you to even come to my house what he was who he was what he did I don't know the scripture don't say it but I say he had a lot of wrong done a lot of wrong as each and every one none of us was worthy for him to come to our house there ain't a person sitting in this building that was worthy for him to come to your house but he did it anyhow he found you anyhow he walked down to where you was anyhow he might have had to walk through a lot of slop to get to you but it got to you anyhow some somehow people come to a church and they think man everybody in here is Holy there ain't nobody ever done nothing wrong we got the same stories most everybody else has had every one of us was one born Sinners every one of us had done things wrong come on time to take your angel wings off for just a moment every one of us was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to this world speaking lies some of us was out in sin some of us was committing adulteries and fornication some of us was drinking some of us was yeah we was doing all of it but it came anyhow he found me anyhow he walked down to where I was anyhow it was God rich and mercy what was it he had some claims there in this earth and the devil had put a false claim but he said devil that one ain't yours that one that one that one that one ain't yours ain't none of these yours Hallelujah you need to look at that devil and say devil
