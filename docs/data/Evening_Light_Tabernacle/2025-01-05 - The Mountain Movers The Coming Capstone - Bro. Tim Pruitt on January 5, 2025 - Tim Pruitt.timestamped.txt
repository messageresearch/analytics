[53:48] we're we're I'm going to ask you to
[53:51] pardon me while I read again from
[53:53] Zechariah 4 and verse 1
[53:57] and because these are modern events and
[54:00] things happen in the day that are made
[54:02] clear by this prophecy so we're going to
[54:06] be looking into that today and looking
[54:09] into the word and seeing um our day our
[54:12] hour and what the holy spirit is doing
[54:15] today and Zechariah 4:1 and the angel
[54:20] that talked with me came again and wake
[54:23] me as a man that is wakened out of his
[54:26] sleep and said unto me what seest thou
[54:30] and I said I have looked and behold a
[54:33] Candlestick all of gold and a bowl upon
[54:36] the top of it and the Seven lamps
[54:38] thereof and seven pipes to the seven
[54:40] lamps which are up on the top thereof
[54:44] and two olive trees by it one upon the
[54:48] right side of the bowl and the other
[54:50] upon the left side thereof and so I
[54:54] answered and spake to the angel that
[54:56] talked with me saying what are these my
[54:59] Lord and then the angel that talked with
[55:01] me answered and said knowest thou not
[55:04] what these be and I said no my Lord and
[55:07] then he answered and spake unto me
[55:09] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[55:13] zerubabel saying not by might nor by
[55:16] power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord
[55:20] of host who art thou oh great Mountain
[55:23] before zerubabel Thou shalt become a
[55:26] plane and he shall bring forth The
[55:30] Headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[55:34] Grace Grace unto it amen God bless you
[55:38] you can be seated today we're going to
[55:41] be speaking on the coming Capstone as
[55:44] you see in zachariah's Prophecy where he
[55:48] said that um that he shall bring forth
[55:52] the headstones with shoutings cry in
[55:57] Grace Grace unto it and of course um
[56:01] Grace upon Grace bringing uh again the
[56:05] Sha the the great Capstone now this
[56:08] message today will will be a moment of
[56:13] reflection um upon the past and
[56:16] meditating upon the future and asking
[56:20] ourselves um where are we in time and
[56:24] what is the present state
[56:26] of the church and so this will be kind
[56:30] of be a New Year's message this morning
[56:33] as I I really in some ways kind of um
[56:37] step aside from my my next part on this
[56:41] um this series on the mountain movers
[56:43] and bring this in as I speak on the
[56:46] coming Capstone this morning but being
[56:49] this is a new year service kind of
[56:51] honing in on some thoughts that has to
[56:54] do with where we are in time and a
[56:58] little bit of reflection upon um that uh
[57:03] and and of course you know as um we've
[57:06] just had some wonderful meetings with
[57:08] our brother Murphy Wong and and uh just
[57:12] was a glorious time hearing the word and
[57:15] we were refreshed by it and blessed by
[57:17] it and I know you were um as I heard
[57:21] back from many of you that were so
[57:23] blessed by his ministry and uh
[57:26] you know we um had um of course the New
[57:30] Year service and then I took him out to
[57:34] um to Lakeside there for a few days of
[57:38] RNR and and uh just spend a little
[57:41] personal time together and of course
[57:44] then as the first light of the morning
[57:47] dawned in
[57:49] 2025 my thoughts were
[57:53] 2025 think of it you you know as I went
[57:58] back in my mind and was reflecting I
[58:01] thought about 50 years ago on a Tuesday
[58:05] night and I'll tell you a little bit
[58:08] about it it was February the 18th
[58:11] 1975 and it's forever blazoned on my on
[58:16] my memory um it was a a night where we
[58:20] at that time had four Services a week we
[58:24] had a Sunday morning and Sunday night
[58:26] and then Tuesday night where we would
[58:28] play a a tape and Wednesday uh then
[58:31] Thursday night where we would have a a
[58:33] midweek service and um so you know we it
[58:38] was our routine there to meet together
[58:40] on that Tuesday night and and um that
[58:44] day I had I in preparation for church
[58:48] you know we were just out on a big farm
[58:51] and it was mostly well it was just
[58:53] family basically that met together with
[58:56] us and um you know so I I wasn't
[59:00] expecting anybody but just the the the
[59:04] family which would be about 12 or 13 of
[59:06] us at the time that would meet in the
[59:08] old um white frame Church there on White
[59:12] Oak Road and and uh you know we we had
[59:15] been meeting now for about 3 years in
[59:17] that building and and um we're you just
[59:21] plowing along and and um just doing the
[59:24] best we could with what God gave us and
[59:28] um you know we had no no facilities
[59:31] there running water we had electricity
[59:34] you know I've told you many times six
[59:36] light bulbs from the ceiling and and um
[59:39] and then one plug in and the whole thing
[59:42] so you know it was um that was all the
[59:45] convenience we had and we would heat
[59:47] with old Barrel um uh stoves that we had
[59:50] made out of 55 gallon drums and and
[59:54] turned on the side and built legs on my
[59:56] father and my brothers did and Welding
[59:59] it together and and putting pipes out
[1:00:01] the window and heating the best we could
[1:00:04] the old the old building that was
[1:00:06] uninsulated and rough floors that you
[1:00:09] could see through and uh sometimes uh
[1:00:12] just where there were holes in it and so
[1:00:15] on like that no no modern conveniences
[1:00:18] you know uh there was a song that was
[1:00:20] even written during that time and um we
[1:00:24] had visitors like um the Young family
[1:00:26] came and from um brother Roy Phillips
[1:00:29] church at that time what became brother
[1:00:31] Donnie Ran's church and um they visited
[1:00:34] us and and S sang for us and while they
[1:00:38] were singing um there and looking around
[1:00:42] at the old building that was rustic and
[1:00:45] um everything very primitive um you know
[1:00:50] we they looked around and seeing the
[1:00:52] broken window panes and that we would
[1:00:55] try had a patch up because the windows
[1:00:58] the old frames were so rotted that they
[1:01:00] would not no longer hold the paines good
[1:01:02] and they would wind would come and blow
[1:01:05] them out so we must have had some some
[1:01:07] of them that had been broken or out that
[1:01:09] day when they visited because they
[1:01:12] sister geralene y would write a song and
[1:01:16] said you know in an old country church
[1:01:19] with broken window of pains and then she
[1:01:22] would tell again you know how that the
[1:01:26] you know they've got him back in the
[1:01:27] manger once again it said just a I saw
[1:01:31] as the Saints would praise the Lord back
[1:01:33] in something like a cattle stall and and
[1:01:36] you know she make the song and write it
[1:01:38] it was a beautiful song but they got him
[1:01:41] back in the manger once again this old
[1:01:44] church World they didn't want him they
[1:01:46] didn't then and you know so she said as
[1:01:50] the tears fell down my feet upon on my
[1:01:53] face I saw it all I saw my Lord once
[1:01:56] again in a cattle stall you know we were
[1:01:59] we were there we had um uh been pushed
[1:02:02] out of the the churches that we were in
[1:02:06] and we had to find a place where the
[1:02:08] word of God would be preached and where
[1:02:11] it would be welcomed and received and
[1:02:14] and on that particular night I I would
[1:02:17] like I said preparing for church I
[1:02:20] reached in and got a long sleeve Shir
[1:02:22] shirt it was cool at the time and
[1:02:25] grabbed it
[1:02:26] and um as I put it on quickly for church
[1:02:29] I noticed it was too big for me my dad
[1:02:32] and I had one the same color and they it
[1:02:35] got hung in my closet and so I just
[1:02:37] grabbed it and put it on and so it's
[1:02:39] down below my shoulders and sleeves too
[1:02:41] long and bulky around and and um you
[1:02:45] know I uh I said oh you know I'm in a
[1:02:48] hurry we'll just go to church and and as
[1:02:51] we were starting the service as we
[1:02:54] customarily did sit and and prayed and
[1:02:58] waited on the Lord and and and
[1:03:00] prayerfully waited here comes a couple
[1:03:03] walking in the door uh with three
[1:03:06] children and that would be brother
[1:03:08] LoveIt and Sister Louise butts and what
[1:03:11] would become my wife Karen and Denette
[1:03:13] my sister-in-law and brother Tim buts um
[1:03:17] I think he's he's here this morning and
[1:03:20] um you know they would all come into the
[1:03:22] church for the first time and I I would
[1:03:25] look over my older brother who also
[1:03:28] would Minister with me at that time and
[1:03:30] he's 9 years older and I say hey you
[1:03:33] know you got anything to preach tonight
[1:03:35] and he said no he said I don't said we
[1:03:38] were we were going to play a tape and I
[1:03:40] I have nothing to say and I said well I
[1:03:43] said you get up and lead some songs and
[1:03:46] I said I'll
[1:03:47] preach so I just you know open my bible
[1:03:52] and um went to Revelation chapter uh to
[1:03:56] and and the message to the Overcomers
[1:03:59] and I just took from my Bible and
[1:04:02] preached that you know just as he in
[1:04:05] that few moments I just gathered my
[1:04:07] thoughts together and and then I jumped
[1:04:09] up and I preached on the the message to
[1:04:12] the Overcomers and and I took each one
[1:04:15] of them down to the ages and the time
[1:04:17] and at the end I asked brother buts if
[1:04:19] he would standing and um give a
[1:04:23] testimony and and he said yes I I am I'm
[1:04:26] really happy to be here I've been
[1:04:28] looking for a church like this that we
[1:04:31] could go to who believe this message and
[1:04:34] he said I I have come for that reason
[1:04:36] and I've heard the word of the Lord
[1:04:39] tonight and um you know we we're just
[1:04:42] going to come and be with you well the
[1:04:44] following Sunday I think it was or the
[1:04:48] one the following Sunday brother Jerome
[1:04:51] buts and his young family would come and
[1:04:54] you know that that event would change my
[1:04:56] life and their lives forever and we
[1:05:00] would be permanently intertwined
[1:05:02] together this year sister Karen and I
[1:05:05] would have celebrated 50 years of
[1:05:08] marriage sorry um and as as I just
[1:05:13] reflected on where time has gone I
[1:05:16] thought back you know of yeah 55 years
[1:05:22] ago now um February the 1st on on
[1:05:26] February the 1st 55 years ago where I
[1:05:30] first started out in full-time Ministry
[1:05:33] I would preach my very first sermon we
[1:05:36] have people that are here that were
[1:05:38] there at that time brother Jim Morgan
[1:05:40] and back over here brother Daryl Baxter
[1:05:43] they were there in the service when I
[1:05:46] preached my first sermon and you know I
[1:05:50] I thought about it you know through and
[1:05:52] reflected back over the many
[1:05:56] years and Miles that we have come and
[1:06:00] now 55 years of ministry here I stand
[1:06:04] today you know um this year looking and
[1:06:09] and expecting and preaching the coming
[1:06:11] of the Lord Jesus just as I did then and
[1:06:15] I believe that we're closer now than
[1:06:18] when we first believed and uh you know I
[1:06:21] I mean from my earliest Ministry my
[1:06:24] earliest min memory rather I I I'd
[1:06:28] always known I was called to preach it
[1:06:30] was just something that it was never an
[1:06:33] angel come hit me with a sword or I
[1:06:36] Heard a Voice or whatever it was just
[1:06:38] something that was in me from a young
[1:06:41] child in my earliest memory I cannot
[1:06:43] remember a time not knowing that I was
[1:06:47] called to preach the gospel when I was
[1:06:50] turned 11 I asked for a Bible with my
[1:06:52] name on in a suit for my birthday and I
[1:06:55] was was already making preparation but
[1:06:58] while still 15 I preached my first
[1:07:01] sermon and I preached it from First
[1:07:03] Corinthians 10 where God LED Israel
[1:07:07] calling them from Egypt and it says it
[1:07:10] like this in First Corinthians 10:1
[1:07:13] moreover Brethren I would not that you
[1:07:16] should be ignorant how that our fathers
[1:07:19] were under the cloud and all passed
[1:07:21] through the sea and were all baptized un
[1:07:25] Moses in the cloud and in the sea and
[1:07:28] all did eat the same spiritual meat and
[1:07:31] all did drink that same spiritual drink
[1:07:35] for they drank of that spiritual rock
[1:07:37] that followed them and that rock was
[1:07:41] Christ but many of them God was not well
[1:07:44] pleased for they were overthrown in the
[1:07:46] wilderness now these things were our
[1:07:50] examples to the intent we should not
[1:07:52] lust after evil things as they also so
[1:07:56] lusted and so as we as I ministered from
[1:08:01] that subject at the old blocker Chapel
[1:08:04] there in serupa Louisiana you know I I I
[1:08:08] thought about where that I started and
[1:08:12] and where that I've come and what I
[1:08:14] began with and even even the text that I
[1:08:19] preached at that time of you know these
[1:08:22] were an example the men who drank from
[1:08:25] that rock who Aid of that mana and yet
[1:08:30] many of them God was not well pleased
[1:08:33] with them and they were overthrown in
[1:08:35] the wilderness and you know for as it
[1:08:38] goes on to say that they would rise up
[1:08:41] to eat and then they rose up to play and
[1:08:45] and so you know I as I I thought of that
[1:08:48] you know where that we have come and and
[1:08:51] it had always my been my desire we don't
[1:08:54] play Church you know but we put
[1:08:57] everything that we have into it if God
[1:09:00] is worth serving he's worth giving all
[1:09:03] of our heart everything we are and this
[1:09:07] past weeks I've spent time with
[1:09:09] ministers like our brother Craig Bo and
[1:09:12] our brother Murphy Wong and they were
[1:09:14] both asking me where are we recognizing
[1:09:18] it's a time of trouble a deceiving age
[1:09:22] where perilous times are here and and
[1:09:24] where are are we and what is next now
[1:09:28] when I and I'm speaking today about
[1:09:31] things and it will anger many I know you
[1:09:34] know it'll bring vinant com condemnation
[1:09:37] from some but this message movement is
[1:09:42] dying and will completely go down into
[1:09:46] death even if it's never drawn up on
[1:09:49] papers this movement will adopt the at
[1:09:51] least the spirit of
[1:09:54] denomination and and we're we're in a
[1:09:56] cycle where that as a movement we're
[1:09:59] going down into death and and and as
[1:10:03] brother Brandon would say it isn't the
[1:10:05] people in there that I'm striking at but
[1:10:07] it's that dominating spirit that makes
[1:10:10] the people think we are the people and
[1:10:13] this is what divides us into sects into
[1:10:16] Cults and aligns us with uh doctrinal
[1:10:19] divisions and of course um there are
[1:10:23] many that are are are
[1:10:25] are um living off of their past
[1:10:30] reputations I I would think of of that
[1:10:33] in in 55 years ago of um even our our
[1:10:39] United States government and and the
[1:10:42] concern of that time was that we were so
[1:10:45] deep in debt and even brother Brandon
[1:10:47] would bring it out and and tell and and
[1:10:50] of course the national debt in 1975 was
[1:10:54] 5 billion
[1:10:56] dollar now we're 36
[1:11:00] trillion and you know as as we look you
[1:11:04] know we people are that's exactly what
[1:11:06] is going on in the economy the world
[1:11:09] economy today we are living off of our
[1:11:12] past
[1:11:13] reputation and and of course the church
[1:11:16] is doing the same thing you know the
[1:11:18] church not the bride but the church is
[1:11:21] living off a past reput reputation uh
[1:11:25] under the ministry of of the lion time
[1:11:28] or we're the church or we're the mother
[1:11:30] church and you know we we're the first
[1:11:32] one that got started and and it's living
[1:11:35] off a past repetition the methodists
[1:11:37] living off of their reputation Baptist
[1:11:39] living off their reputation the
[1:11:41] Pentecostal living off of their glory to
[1:11:44] God one day one time back there a long
[1:11:47] time ago the Saints would dance in the
[1:11:49] spirit and they did this they did that
[1:11:52] oh they were marvelous wonderful moves
[1:11:55] of God and and it's now something past
[1:11:59] and you know um but we because we've all
[1:12:02] got big now and you know and and and of
[1:12:06] course in these 55 years we have
[1:12:10] established churches and we have nice
[1:12:13] buildings and we're growing in number
[1:12:17] but many times the power of the spirit
[1:12:20] is not there and the power of the spirit
[1:12:23] is the life the life of every true move
[1:12:26] of God you know it must be there but we
[1:12:30] see it is Lifting and the movement is
[1:12:33] experiencing the same death that every
[1:12:36] other movement before has experienced it
[1:12:40] is a cycle of Revival and death it has
[1:12:44] always been you know even even I I was
[1:12:48] um reading a little bit because brother
[1:12:50] Craig had asked me about the outpouring
[1:12:52] of the spirit in Russia I've not been
[1:12:54] able to find that he said well I'll tell
[1:12:56] you I can show you the historical events
[1:12:59] it was or demon sharan wrote of the
[1:13:03] outpouring of the spirit in Russia and
[1:13:06] how it moved from there into Armenia and
[1:13:09] um it's a it's a wonderful read if you
[1:13:12] ever want to read it where that he he
[1:13:15] speaks on the happiest people on Earth
[1:13:18] and of course that is people who find
[1:13:20] their place and position and where God
[1:13:22] wants them to move and do and so he
[1:13:25] wrote a book called the happiest people
[1:13:27] on Earth and he told about the
[1:13:29] outpouring of the spirit and how that um
[1:13:33] that from Russia that would come men and
[1:13:36] women every year that were they acted
[1:13:39] strange they were speaking in other
[1:13:42] tongues they were dancing in the spirit
[1:13:45] they had prophecies and miraculous that
[1:13:48] was taking place and and um you know it
[1:13:51] would take a little while to convince
[1:13:54] those Armenians who were
[1:13:57] Presbyterian of the of the of the the
[1:14:00] truth of of Pentecost and and the
[1:14:03] outpouring of the spirit and and they
[1:14:06] they would certainly um uh it would take
[1:14:10] some time it would take actually
[1:14:12] miraculous things that would happen one
[1:14:15] of the brothers would um one of the
[1:14:18] shakarian brothers and Uncle tmus would
[1:14:21] have a prophecy and and um you know
[1:14:25] uh because they were longing for the
[1:14:27] spirit of God and he had experienced
[1:14:30] this with these Russian Believers and
[1:14:32] and deus's father was a staunch um
[1:14:36] Armenian would not accept it at all and
[1:14:39] was not convinced and so you know the
[1:14:42] spirit of God moved upon him and he and
[1:14:46] he and he stood stood up and prophesied
[1:14:49] on this day this very next year you will
[1:14:53] Embrace a son son well they had had a
[1:14:56] bunch of daughters but never a son and
[1:14:59] so you will Embrace a son on this day
[1:15:02] this is thus sayeth the Lord and it
[1:15:04] happened exactly the way it was that it
[1:15:07] said said you know it was actually a
[1:15:09] disgrace among their culture for a man
[1:15:12] not to have a son and and here would be
[1:15:15] the first son that would be born in in
[1:15:18] that family and um and so it it would be
[1:15:21] deus's this would be that was uh sorry
[1:15:25] that was deus's father that was
[1:15:27] prophesied so it' be his grandfather
[1:15:29] that was resisting and then you know but
[1:15:31] he was still unconvinced and and so the
[1:15:35] next year or so he also um uh was going
[1:15:39] to receive them so he thought they would
[1:15:42] be a host to all of these people that
[1:15:44] were coming in from Russia and and would
[1:15:47] provide for them and and so he went out
[1:15:50] to pick out a a calf um out of his herd
[1:15:55] and and there was none finer none finer
[1:15:58] in the herd that would feed everybody
[1:16:00] that was needed and could be slaughtered
[1:16:02] except for one but it had a blemish of a
[1:16:05] blind eye and he said I he he he said I
[1:16:09] know not to offer unto God that which is
[1:16:12] blind and and that has a blemish but I
[1:16:16] tell you what it's the best that I have
[1:16:18] and I I want to I want to take it and
[1:16:20] I'll hide this I will hide this from
[1:16:24] from everybody went so he slaughtered
[1:16:26] the the the calf and and the the large
[1:16:30] steer he he slaughtered it and hid its
[1:16:33] hid its head under a pile of hay and
[1:16:36] where that it could not be found and and
[1:16:38] he prepared it and had it all there and
[1:16:41] the people arrived and they had their
[1:16:44] their prayer and and they were customary
[1:16:46] before they did anything that they would
[1:16:49] they would pray until the spirit moved
[1:16:51] and when the spirit moved for then then
[1:16:53] they would all um move into the spirit
[1:16:56] and and then would they bless the food
[1:16:59] and then they would eat and as they were
[1:17:01] praying the spirit of God Came Upon one
[1:17:04] of them the the the leader there moved
[1:17:07] upon him and he said just a minute there
[1:17:10] is unrighteousness in the camp and he he
[1:17:13] walked right straight over to the barn
[1:17:16] uncovered the the the the Bull's Head
[1:17:19] and showed the blemish there and he said
[1:17:21] see you have offered that which is
[1:17:23] blemished before God and and doing so M
[1:17:28] the Elder sharan fell down and and and
[1:17:32] and surrendered his heart completely to
[1:17:35] God and had the same experience like
[1:17:38] they had and so this would be the
[1:17:41] beginning and in that time there was a
[1:17:43] young man that would raise up he was
[1:17:45] like 11 years old and he would have a
[1:17:47] prophecy and this prophecy would come to
[1:17:51] him in the form of a vision he was not
[1:17:53] able to read or right but he saw in a
[1:17:57] vision these funny letters and so he
[1:18:00] would take and he would write and copy
[1:18:03] each one of them down painfully as and
[1:18:07] and looking into the vision and writing
[1:18:09] it down upon on paper not knowing what
[1:18:12] it meant and he went and showed it to
[1:18:14] others what he had seen in this vision
[1:18:17] and it was in perfect Russian and it was
[1:18:20] that that there was coming a a time
[1:18:24] where there that that there would be
[1:18:26] great persecution upon the Armenian
[1:18:30] country and before this was happened
[1:18:33] they were to move from Armenia and go
[1:18:37] all the way to the east coast of a far
[1:18:40] country and then when they would across
[1:18:43] the sea and when they arrived at that
[1:18:46] that place they would travel all the way
[1:18:48] from the East to the west and they would
[1:18:51] settle there on the west coast and and
[1:18:55] so it would you know that this was
[1:18:58] amazing that they had received this
[1:19:01] prophecy in such a way that a young boy
[1:19:03] of course some would discount it and and
[1:19:06] and not not think anything about it but
[1:19:09] here when some 50 years later when the
[1:19:13] Holy Spirit again appeared and said it's
[1:19:16] time now to leave and so all those
[1:19:19] families sold their houses their lands
[1:19:23] that had been generational homes for
[1:19:26] years and years and years and years and
[1:19:29] they been in their in their lands uh and
[1:19:32] their family names and they sold their
[1:19:34] plows and their cattle and everything
[1:19:37] Livestock in barrel and they moved and
[1:19:39] they moved all the way from from Armenia
[1:19:42] while they were mocked and made fun of
[1:19:44] by others and ridiculed and everything
[1:19:47] else for following this Vision because
[1:19:50] the spirit of God had said now it is
[1:19:52] time you know it was given now some 50
[1:19:55] years ago is now time it is now time to
[1:19:58] make that move and they made that move
[1:20:01] and just within just within years of
[1:20:04] that just in a short time the Turks the
[1:20:07] Muslim Turks would come and they would
[1:20:09] do a genocide in the in the country of
[1:20:12] Armenia and they would wipe out every
[1:20:14] Christian family and rape and pillage
[1:20:17] and take over lands and property and and
[1:20:20] take the women make them wives of the
[1:20:22] Muslims and children and SL them and
[1:20:25] make them into into Muslims and
[1:20:28] everything else and totally a complete
[1:20:31] genocide in fact in during Biden's time
[1:20:34] he um actually recognized for the first
[1:20:37] time that in turkey that there was a um
[1:20:41] a genocide and they called it a genocide
[1:20:44] in the country of Armenia that was
[1:20:45] swallowed up by the chch and you know
[1:20:48] this is history where they killed
[1:20:50] millions of people and they were
[1:20:53] slaughtered and they and so but they
[1:20:55] moved to the West Coast and and of
[1:20:58] course you that you might know it was
[1:21:01] also written and sealed that that there
[1:21:04] will come another time where that there
[1:21:05] would be another persecution and they
[1:21:08] again would would face similar things
[1:21:11] and of course we know there's a
[1:21:13] tribulation that is that is set for
[1:21:15] those that are left behind but anyway
[1:21:18] they happen to be there right at the
[1:21:20] same time as a churches that were uh
[1:21:24] were
[1:21:25] experiencing prophecies and workings of
[1:21:28] the Holy Spirit and and um speaking in
[1:21:31] tongues and all that and one day some of
[1:21:33] them walked by the the um the Zeo of
[1:21:37] mission and they heard strange things
[1:21:39] going on and went in there and they
[1:21:41] found that the Holy Spirit had now
[1:21:43] fallen on others than the Armenians and
[1:21:46] so they you know in in a sense would
[1:21:48] join in with the Pentecostal isua
[1:21:52] Revival so you know again um but however
[1:21:58] by the 1940s when Deus was coming along
[1:22:02] he he found that everything had so
[1:22:07] denominated had come to a place that
[1:22:09] there was a coldness that had come to
[1:22:12] the church and the Armenians was only
[1:22:15] they were concerned about their little
[1:22:17] four and no more and it was UN Armenian
[1:22:20] to even go out and preach to others and
[1:22:22] try to get them in because they remained
[1:22:25] a separate people and and um you know to
[1:22:28] themselves and but you know as uh as um
[1:22:33] as he wrote In the book and I just want
[1:22:35] to share this phrase be this this little
[1:22:38] paragraph is why I have background this
[1:22:41] and he said for the fact was as as he
[1:22:45] tried to as he tried to have meetings as
[1:22:48] he tried to have you know where that he
[1:22:50] could Tred to get other people filled
[1:22:53] with the spirit and and people to to he
[1:22:57] would actually found the Full Gospel
[1:22:59] businessmen and as you know which would
[1:23:01] be an oasis for brother Brandon's
[1:23:04] meetings and a a place that the word
[1:23:07] could be preached and and so on like
[1:23:10] that when he would be pushed out of the
[1:23:12] churches and the inner Circles of
[1:23:14] Pentecost the Full Gospel businessmen
[1:23:16] would still receive him because they
[1:23:18] recognized him as a prophet because they
[1:23:21] already believed in prophets it had a
[1:23:23] prophet that and their Prophet was um
[1:23:26] was was one who had saw this Vision in
[1:23:29] in Russian and told them to move and and
[1:23:32] all of these things and so they believed
[1:23:34] in prophets and they saw the prophetic
[1:23:37] Ministry of brother brandom and they
[1:23:38] embraced it and they received it even
[1:23:41] though they did not receive his message
[1:23:44] but but but they they had got so tied
[1:23:47] down in the way that they did things
[1:23:51] until now it would it had become Creeds
[1:23:55] which is statements of faith and they're
[1:23:58] based on truths but where men become and
[1:24:02] make them dogmas where they're dogmatic
[1:24:05] about it and rigid and and unbendable
[1:24:09] and and to the point that it puts uh the
[1:24:12] Holy Spirit In Chains as it was as you
[1:24:16] know brother Bram told us in the Feast
[1:24:17] of the trumpets he said that the Holy
[1:24:20] Spirit has been bound by these
[1:24:23] denominational Rivers
[1:24:25] for 2,000 years and and he says you know
[1:24:29] when and it and he said but it's now
[1:24:31] being loosed by the end time message but
[1:24:35] you you see you see the cycle continues
[1:24:39] where chains again get put back up on
[1:24:44] the spirit of God and and he gets
[1:24:46] hindered and kept back and not able to
[1:24:49] work among the people and do what he
[1:24:52] once did and so deamus was saying there
[1:24:56] he said for the fact was that the wind
[1:24:59] of Pentecost which had blown out of
[1:25:01] Russia into Armenia nearly a century
[1:25:04] before had dwindled by now into a
[1:25:07] denomination as rigid as any other it
[1:25:11] was always this way all through history
[1:25:15] each fresh outpouring of the spirit soon
[1:25:18] became in human hands a new
[1:25:22] Orthodoxy and the great Revival on isza
[1:25:25] street for example here in this very
[1:25:28] city of Los Angeles which started out in
[1:25:31] Freedom and joy and a breaking down of
[1:25:34] barriers had solidified by the 1940s
[1:25:38] into a number of self-contained churches
[1:25:41] who could who couldn't communicate even
[1:25:44] with each other let alone the world as a
[1:25:47] whole and so you see by by that time by
[1:25:51] even the
[1:25:53] 1940s when which is scarcely what um 35
[1:25:58] years from the outpouring in
[1:26:01] 1906 you know um again it is had become
[1:26:07] by then so rigid so so bound down with
[1:26:12] Traditions with with with Creeds with
[1:26:16] things that were taken from truths that
[1:26:19] was meant to bring freedom that was
[1:26:22] meant to bring Liberty
[1:26:24] and turned it around and make it into
[1:26:27] bondage you know this is what happened
[1:26:30] with Israel they were given a Sabbath
[1:26:32] where they could take off and rest but
[1:26:35] they made it where till that was to be
[1:26:37] the very thing they would use to crucify
[1:26:41] Jesus Christ because they had made it in
[1:26:44] such a tight ritual and a rule until
[1:26:47] there was no room for the spirit and
[1:26:50] even even God himself who had made the
[1:26:53] Sabbath and he said May the the
[1:26:57] Sabbath the Sabbath was made to give a
[1:27:00] rest and here I am the lord of the
[1:27:03] Harvest and the lord of the Sabbath and
[1:27:05] here they want to condemn me because we
[1:27:08] dare to even pick something to eat on
[1:27:12] the Sabbath day and and and again are to
[1:27:15] loose a daughter of Israel who were
[1:27:18] bound was bound and and and was and was
[1:27:21] there uh crippled and and he said you
[1:27:25] you would you on the Sabbath day you
[1:27:27] would loosen ox and go get him water on
[1:27:30] the Sabbath day you would get one out of
[1:27:33] the ditch well how much more this
[1:27:35] daughter of Abraham for me to release
[1:27:38] her from the bondage of this Affliction
[1:27:42] but you see by then they had taken it
[1:27:45] and made it into rules and regulations
[1:27:49] and laws until even the lord of the
[1:27:53] Sabbath was condemned by his own
[1:28:01] words and I
[1:28:03] wonder now this year we have been we
[1:28:07] have done 60 years since the seventh
[1:28:10] angel finished sounding his
[1:28:13] message what have we done in these past
[1:28:17] 60 years and remember I'm
[1:28:21] reflecting well at first
[1:28:25] we didn't have very much of the
[1:28:27] message a set of tape sermons cost as
[1:28:30] much as two new pickup
[1:28:32] trucks there were no
[1:28:35] churches there were none just a few one
[1:28:38] one Jeffersonville one over in in
[1:28:41] Phoenix area at Mesa and another at
[1:28:44] Tucson that was about it a few here
[1:28:47] maybe one up in New York or somewhere
[1:28:49] else there were no
[1:28:51] churches our own church here would
[1:28:54] wouldn't be we wouldn't even start it to
[1:28:56] 72 and in a building out of a coming out
[1:28:59] of a home but there were no churches
[1:29:02] during that time ministry we all uh they
[1:29:05] were very much like Jesus disciples
[1:29:07] before his death burial and resurrection
[1:29:09] and and they were all arguing arguing on
[1:29:13] who was going to be the
[1:29:14] greatest they were all all saying you
[1:29:18] know getting angry and fighting over
[1:29:20] position and joying for position you
[1:29:23] know maneuvering aggressively for a
[1:29:25] place of preeminence and and the mother
[1:29:28] of James and John coming in and saying
[1:29:31] you know hey Grant my sons give me give
[1:29:34] give me this grant I want this was Grant
[1:29:37] my son one of them to sit on your right
[1:29:39] and the other on the left in your
[1:29:41] kingdom and and Jesus Jesus would say
[1:29:46] that's not even for me to give you know
[1:29:48] and and he said if you you want to be if
[1:29:51] you want to be great become humble
[1:29:55] you know bow down worship um surrender
[1:29:59] be a
[1:30:00] servant you you're going at this all
[1:30:02] backwards and all
[1:30:06] wrong as I said the ministry joing for
[1:30:10] position maneuvering aggressively for a
[1:30:13] place of
[1:30:14] preeminence one to be the Joshua it
[1:30:18] would be men rise that would be the
[1:30:20] Joshua needed to place the mystery truth
[1:30:24] and as the Apostle then set it all in
[1:30:27] order and the other was to be as a would
[1:30:30] rise up and he's an Aaron as Aaron was
[1:30:32] to Moses and as the teacher would bring
[1:30:35] new understanding to its
[1:30:37] truths and and be able to say it you
[1:30:40] know in an educated manner where that
[1:30:43] Moses had an impediment of speech you
[1:30:46] can read between the
[1:30:47] lines and each one would be each one
[1:30:51] would be the one to perfect the bride
[1:30:54] and and now the bride was for one of
[1:30:57] them to
[1:30:59] impregnate with their own IDE ideology
[1:31:02] and beliefs and then arises others who
[1:31:06] who um you know in reaction to that who
[1:31:10] just go to tape only and do away with
[1:31:12] the ministry all together proclaiming
[1:31:15] that brother bradam said Rapture in
[1:31:17] faith lays on the tapes and so therefore
[1:31:20] we don't even need the ministry and
[1:31:23] preachers to preach and I want you to
[1:31:25] say let me go on record there's not one
[1:31:29] quote as a student of this message I say
[1:31:33] there's not one quote that says
[1:31:36] rapturing faith lays on the tapes it
[1:31:40] doesn't say that it you know I'll read
[1:31:42] it to you he said in the message
[1:31:45] absolute and I remember when he swept
[1:31:48] down there in that big light standing
[1:31:51] Yonder at the bottom of the river 1933
[1:31:54] in June when he said as John the Baptist
[1:31:57] was sent forth and forun the first
[1:31:59] coming of Christ I send you with a
[1:32:01] message to the world to forerun the
[1:32:04] second coming of Christ and a world
[1:32:06] around the world
[1:32:08] she's feminine speaking of his ministry
[1:32:11] she's went when Revival fires has been
[1:32:15] built for 15 years near on nearly every
[1:32:19] Mountain Divine Healing Across the
[1:32:21] Nation and power and restoration
[1:32:24] and I believe she speaking of his
[1:32:26] ministry is ready to strike that final
[1:32:30] CL climax Yonder to bring forth a faith
[1:32:33] that Rapture the church into glory and
[1:32:36] she his ministry is laying in the
[1:32:39] messages were really in the end time and
[1:32:42] I just submit indeed he had been laying
[1:32:45] in one message after another after
[1:32:48] another building up to that final climax
[1:32:51] where the seven thunders of Revelation
[1:32:53] 10 would reveal the symbols of the seal
[1:32:56] to bring forth the faith the original
[1:32:58] Faith the words are restored to what
[1:33:01] Paul preached so he would take and build
[1:33:04] upon his statue of a perfect man spoken
[1:33:07] word his Original Seed wisdom versus
[1:33:10] Faith he was just laying in even
[1:33:12] messages like the church ages Daniel 70
[1:33:15] weeks and placing all of them he was
[1:33:18] laying in the
[1:33:19] messages getting them you know building
[1:33:22] getting people ready for the final
[1:33:25] climax which would be of his ministry
[1:33:28] which would be the third pull which
[1:33:31] would be the opening of those Seven
[1:33:33] Seals and the revealing of the Min the
[1:33:36] mysteries of God and of course that
[1:33:39] would produce a faith turn us back to
[1:33:42] the original Pentecostal faith that Paul
[1:33:48] preached but it's taken today well
[1:33:50] Raptor and fat lays on the tape so
[1:33:53] you're not going to get it from hearing
[1:33:54] a preacher so don't listen to any
[1:33:56] preacher just play a tape you see that's
[1:33:59] a
[1:34:03] Creed that is a dogma of man and it's
[1:34:07] done to hinder and to thwart and to
[1:34:10] choke the Holy
[1:34:14] Spirit now how do we get in all of this
[1:34:19] well if you go with me to Jude chapter
[1:34:22] 1 I'll read from the fifth
[1:34:25] verse I will therefore put you in
[1:34:28] remembrance this is going to remind you
[1:34:30] 1 Corinthians
[1:34:34] 10 though you once knew this how the
[1:34:38] Lord having saved the people out of the
[1:34:40] land of Egypt afterward destroyed them
[1:34:43] that believed it
[1:34:45] not and the angels which kept not their
[1:34:48] first estate but left their own
[1:34:52] habitation he had reserved in
[1:34:55] Everlasting chains under Darkness unto
[1:34:58] the Judgment of the great day now
[1:35:01] remember this has always been what Satan
[1:35:05] has
[1:35:06] done all the way from the beginning
[1:35:08] we're not even talking about in Eden
[1:35:11] we're talking about prior to Eden in the
[1:35:14] heavens we know what Lucifer did he
[1:35:17] exalted himself above God in all that is
[1:35:21] called God he did not keep his first
[1:35:25] estate as a protector of the word is a
[1:35:28] covering cherub he was not happy where
[1:35:31] he was but he wanted worship
[1:35:35] himself so he exalted himself and and so
[1:35:38] these are angels that kept not their
[1:35:41] first estate and I just want you to know
[1:35:44] this is the definition and
[1:35:46] identification of Fallen Angels men who
[1:35:50] will not stay in their position
[1:35:54] who want to exalt themselves over the
[1:35:57] word of God and even over Vindicated
[1:36:02] Messengers that they've got to be the
[1:36:05] one to bring Clarity and understanding
[1:36:07] to it and they've got to be the one who
[1:36:10] who sets it in order and they've got to
[1:36:12] be one who who can say it uh when he
[1:36:16] couldn't say
[1:36:17] it it is Angels who kept not their first
[1:36:21] estate and they when they do that they
[1:36:23] are Fallen
[1:36:30] Angels remember brother bradam and
[1:36:32] Christ of mystery picks us up and he
[1:36:34] said notice in the last days and that's
[1:36:36] where we are Lucifer is doing the same
[1:36:38] thing can you see it the devil doing the
[1:36:41] same thing building up a hybrid church I
[1:36:43] want you to watch this it'll be a theme
[1:36:45] throughout this sermon hybrid Church a
[1:36:48] hybrid by hybrid members hybrid by
[1:36:51] knowledge instead of the word here's the
[1:36:55] way they're going to be hybrid
[1:37:00] knowledge instead of the
[1:37:04] word now watch this by intellectual
[1:37:09] men instead of Born Again
[1:37:12] men building an intellectual Kingdom
[1:37:16] that will outshine Christ's little bitty
[1:37:19] flock what did that see fallen angels
[1:37:23] the Bible said it was Fallen Angels who
[1:37:25] listened to Lucifer instead of Christ
[1:37:27] who they once belonged to is that right
[1:37:30] now listen close Fallen Angels what kind
[1:37:33] of angels Luther Wesley Catholic
[1:37:37] Pentecostals and Y well I say even
[1:37:41] message amen message who kept not there
[1:37:45] first to
[1:37:47] State and and like the Angels did and
[1:37:50] has fell into organization
[1:37:53] like Lucifer's main hold at NAA and what
[1:37:56] have they done they've organized a great
[1:37:59] eom unical Association of minister to
[1:38:02] make an image to the Beast as the Bible
[1:38:04] said and building a Christian economy
[1:38:06] that'll close the doors of this church
[1:38:07] and others like it see Lucifer at his
[1:38:10] work he said what they do they sold out
[1:38:13] the reason of wisdom and education like
[1:38:17] Eve did what's now like Eve did Fallen
[1:38:21] Angels did wesle a man of God but what
[1:38:24] followed him Fallen Angels got into it
[1:38:28] what was it first what was Angels first
[1:38:31] created beings of God but fell for
[1:38:33] Lucifer's wisdom fell for Lu Lucifer's
[1:38:37] wisdom and you see what they become
[1:38:38] fallen angels and organizations from Men
[1:38:41] of God who went out to establish truths
[1:38:44] in the Earth but before that truth could
[1:38:46] go on and proclamate and get on to the
[1:38:49] real revelation of God Fallen Angels
[1:38:51] come in it and took it over and made
[1:38:53] denominations out of it and that's the
[1:38:56] reason the revelation of the Sevenfold
[1:38:58] mystery the seven mystery seal mystery
[1:39:01] had to be
[1:39:02] unfolded now you see it what they left
[1:39:04] off what Luther would have went would
[1:39:07] have
[1:39:07] had what L if Luther would have went on
[1:39:11] it would have been here if Wesley would
[1:39:12] have been on if Pentecost would have
[1:39:14] went on what what would they have done
[1:39:17] but now the only thing can happen there
[1:39:18] has to be a message at the end time when
[1:39:21] nothing else can follow it
[1:39:24] and now the ecumenical world has set up
[1:39:26] such a regime that there is no can be no
[1:39:29] denomination nothing else follow it and
[1:39:31] you're either in it or you're not you're
[1:39:33] not in it and the fruit is at the top of
[1:39:35] the tree and the light is shining on it
[1:39:38] and on that predestinated fruit and
[1:39:41] she's ripening into a Christlike fruit
[1:39:45] bringing forth the same melness and
[1:39:47] sweetness and the same spirit that he
[1:39:51] had in him
[1:39:53] oh my think of that here we are in in
[1:39:57] time you know when I think where we make
[1:40:02] traditions we we make uh we make
[1:40:05] Creeds you know you just come up and say
[1:40:09] I believe Malachi 4 I believe the
[1:40:11] message well you got the Holy Ghost in
[1:40:13] and still living dirty sinful
[1:40:17] lives you know just just make a claim
[1:40:20] and say you got it and by Faith by faith
[1:40:23] say say you got it let me tell you it
[1:40:24] was never by faith nothing it was an
[1:40:28] experience it wasn't a make believe it
[1:40:30] wasn't a guess
[1:40:32] work God came in their lives and they
[1:40:35] were radically
[1:40:37] changed that's what you're looking for
[1:40:39] in your life amen is a radical change
[1:40:43] where you're a new creature in
[1:40:45] Christ he said in world falling apart
[1:40:49] preached it right here in sort he said
[1:40:51] our educational system our
[1:40:53] denominational system has took the place
[1:40:57] of the Holy Spirit leading in the church
[1:40:59] and I want you to think of that our
[1:41:02] great fine training of ministers and
[1:41:05] things has taken the place of all night
[1:41:09] prayer
[1:41:10] meetings and the oldtime way we used to
[1:41:13] get to God and now instead of having
[1:41:16] preachers we got
[1:41:18] lectures men who knows the word just as
[1:41:21] well they can sit there and put it
[1:41:23] together together in such a way it's
[1:41:25] astounding how they can do it they know
[1:41:27] the mechanics but that ain't the
[1:41:31] Dynamics we want the Dynamics I don't
[1:41:34] care about the mechanics I want to know
[1:41:36] the Dynamics what does it do I don't
[1:41:39] know how that car runs out there runs
[1:41:42] out there it's got pistons and cylinders
[1:41:44] I don't know how much pressure it is
[1:41:46] used the only thing I know is that
[1:41:48] Dynamics put her out there and drive it
[1:41:52] and that's what we know God made a
[1:41:54] promise I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[1:41:57] Flesh your sons and daughters shall
[1:41:59] prophesy how's he going to do it I can't
[1:42:02] tell you I just want to know the
[1:42:04] Dynamics of God's system that's the main
[1:42:07] thing today we've studied the mechanics
[1:42:10] until that's all
[1:42:12] mechanical and and what is good in an
[1:42:15] automobile without something in it to
[1:42:17] drive it what good is lights are the
[1:42:20] fixture if there's no current to go in
[1:42:22] it see we all got mechanics we got
[1:42:25] schools and Educators that can train man
[1:42:28] till he can stand in the Pulpit with
[1:42:30] such manners till he's an eloquent
[1:42:33] person that still don't bring the power
[1:42:35] of God where is the power of God that
[1:42:37] used to be in the church where is that
[1:42:40] Pentecostal blessing that used to flow
[1:42:42] through the churches that's the reason
[1:42:45] our world is falling apart because we
[1:42:47] got away from the real principle of God
[1:42:50] and educated men in the systems and
[1:42:52] things and that's what God is in
[1:42:54] condition we are today and I believe
[1:42:57] that's why our world is falling
[1:43:01] apart you say brother Tim but we don't
[1:43:04] have seminaries like that we made
[1:43:06] churches
[1:43:08] seminaries we've trained them we trained
[1:43:12] them to understand this concept and that
[1:43:15] concept and whatever and then you have
[1:43:17] men who have have never been never been
[1:43:20] in the presence of God up in the Pulpit
[1:43:23] trying to preach the word of
[1:43:26] God can you imagine that men who go out
[1:43:30] without the Holy Ghost without his
[1:43:32] anointing intellectually put together
[1:43:36] sermons let me tell you what happens
[1:43:38] there them were dead sermons and dead
[1:43:40] sermons
[1:43:42] kill false prophets bring forth false
[1:43:46] births and it's a false birth just to
[1:43:48] make a confession of faith and say I got
[1:43:51] the Holy Ghost that's a false birth
[1:43:56] but you see even in the first age there
[1:43:59] become a departing for the
[1:44:01] truth I think of it you know as the book
[1:44:04] what that was given on the day of
[1:44:07] Pentecost the word that was revealed it
[1:44:10] was the word coming down it was spirit
[1:44:12] and truth and Paul even years later
[1:44:15] would say listen I'm showing you
[1:44:18] Mysteries I'm showing you the the
[1:44:20] doctrine the truths of it but I want you
[1:44:22] to know this word this gospel did not
[1:44:25] come in word only but it came in power
[1:44:29] and much
[1:44:30] Assurance it wasn't just a intellectual
[1:44:33] gospel it was a lifechanging a power
[1:44:37] driven a gospel that changed lives
[1:44:41] radically Chang them and put a faith in
[1:44:43] them that faith that we now sa was once
[1:44:46] deliver to the Saints and that's what we
[1:44:49] must contend for today
[1:44:53] but he would
[1:44:54] say as it rocked along and as I said
[1:44:58] Paul had it he was ready for Rapture
[1:45:01] they were the grain to be taken in the
[1:45:04] Garner and all they lacked was
[1:45:10] us could not close up Redemption and
[1:45:14] finish it because we're
[1:45:17] missing we hadn't been manifested on the
[1:45:19] earth so instead of coming back Jesus
[1:45:22] Bec a mediator and begins to
[1:45:26] intercede and he's soon sending back the
[1:45:28] Holy Spirit now to dwell in the church
[1:45:31] to work in it until every predestinated
[1:45:34] seed can be found and when the last one
[1:45:36] comes in the Rapture will go that's when
[1:45:40] mercy will be over that's when he that
[1:45:42] is filthy will be filthy still and he
[1:45:44] that is righteous will be righteous
[1:45:45] still and he that is Holy be holy still
[1:45:47] but don't close the door till that last
[1:45:50] one comes in
[1:45:56] because I'll tell you to try to close
[1:45:58] the doors to go against
[1:46:00] God because he said when I open no man
[1:46:04] can shut it and no when I shut it no man
[1:46:07] can open
[1:46:09] it one day he'll shut it the last one
[1:46:13] will be in like the door that sealed
[1:46:15] Noah in the
[1:46:16] ark and there won't be
[1:46:21] another by this first
[1:46:23] AG we're not even we're not even yet out
[1:46:27] of the first Ag and they go into this
[1:46:30] cycle of Decay and
[1:46:33] death Revelation 2:4 says
[1:46:37] nevertheless I have somewhat against
[1:46:40] thee I have somewhat against thee
[1:46:43] because thou H has left thy first
[1:46:46] love oh church if there's anything get
[1:46:51] that love back in your life
[1:46:54] get that passion to please God that
[1:46:57] fervency to serve him with all your
[1:46:59] heart that cry for the reaching of the
[1:47:02] spirit that that that way were that you
[1:47:06] were led by the Holy Ghost where you can
[1:47:09] be sensitive to the spirit of God and
[1:47:12] and all and he can pour out his spirit
[1:47:14] so that old men dream dreams and young
[1:47:16] men see visions and All My Sons and
[1:47:18] Daughters I will pour out my spirit and
[1:47:21] they'll prophesy
[1:47:24] so to understand this you must realize
[1:47:27] he was not speaking to the original
[1:47:29] Saints of Ephesus alone that it was to
[1:47:32] that entire age he was talking about and
[1:47:35] it would be all the generations in that
[1:47:37] span Now history keeps repeating itself
[1:47:41] in in the generations of Israel we see
[1:47:45] Revival in one generation only do you
[1:47:47] see the fire is fading in the next and
[1:47:50] the third generation Embers may be
[1:47:52] glowing slightly but in the fourth there
[1:47:54] may be no vestage whatever of that
[1:47:56] original flame and just think about it
[1:47:59] David David a man after God's Own Heart
[1:48:02] David a king in his likeness a David of
[1:48:05] whom he would say the Messiah would be a
[1:48:07] son of David and would sit on his
[1:48:10] throne and now the Next Generation you
[1:48:13] see the fire Fades and then the next and
[1:48:17] you see Solomon bringing in other gods
[1:48:20] and the religion becoming contaminated
[1:48:22] and hybrid and and and altars to other
[1:48:25] gods in in in the very city of Jerusalem
[1:48:29] itself and and all and in the third
[1:48:32] generation Embers only slightly in the
[1:48:34] fourth there may not be no vestage
[1:48:36] whatever of that original flame and then
[1:48:39] God will light the fire again and you
[1:48:41] will have revivals and men will rise up
[1:48:45] you know like Hezekiah or Godly Uzziah
[1:48:49] or Josiah or men like that and there'll
[1:48:52] be a reval
[1:48:53] and and and he light the fire again but
[1:48:55] this the same process is repeated and
[1:48:58] it's simply the manifestation of the
[1:49:01] truth that God has no
[1:49:06] grandchildren salvation cannot be
[1:49:09] passed by natural
[1:49:11] birth it isn't in the
[1:49:14] word if there is any message that we
[1:49:17] need to get across to our young people
[1:49:19] you're born in sin shaping in inequity
[1:49:23] you don't have a right to nothing
[1:49:24] because you were born in the in the in
[1:49:26] this church amen you have no right to
[1:49:29] anything you're but you're blessed to be
[1:49:33] able to have an
[1:49:35] opportunity Amen to be filled with the
[1:49:37] spirit yourself where that you won't be
[1:49:39] a grandchild of the message but you'll
[1:49:42] be a child of God
[1:49:46] yourself but you see you start out with
[1:49:48] truly Born Again Believers and Next
[1:49:51] Generation comes along and they're no
[1:49:54] more just plain Christians but now they
[1:49:57] take on a denominational name and are
[1:49:59] now Baptist
[1:50:01] methodists and that's exactly what they
[1:50:03] are too because they're not Christians
[1:50:06] you see they're living a name they have
[1:50:08] a name that they're living the Bible
[1:50:11] said but they're
[1:50:14] dead you see and and there are many
[1:50:16] people that want to come under that that
[1:50:19] uh that umbrella well I'm in the message
[1:50:23] I I believe the
[1:50:24] message it's a
[1:50:26] name amen and it's a claim to life but
[1:50:30] you can be
[1:50:31] dead never have an experience God
[1:50:36] yourself and you know what happens when
[1:50:39] you have it coming along like that and
[1:50:42] so many bypassing a new birth then the
[1:50:45] church becomes as described in the Book
[1:50:47] of Revelation a cage of ever unclean and
[1:50:52] hateful bird people who cheat and lie
[1:50:55] and steal and do crooked business deals
[1:50:58] and and and adultery and
[1:51:01] fornication and pornography and and
[1:51:04] every kind of lust spirit and everything
[1:51:06] else all
[1:51:10] claiming to be in the same cage with the
[1:51:16] others and they become a cage full of
[1:51:19] unclean and hateful Birds
[1:51:23] oh brother Tim you're too Melancholy for
[1:51:26] me this morning I'm reflecting for a
[1:51:29] moment I'm looking at the
[1:51:32] soberness as we see we see people
[1:51:36] dying Generations dying we see churches
[1:51:41] dying we see families
[1:51:51] dying you see these folks are coming now
[1:51:54] together by the will of
[1:51:56] Man by being physically Born Into the
[1:51:59] message Community they're born by the
[1:52:01] will of man they're just raised up that
[1:52:04] way they just accept it as truth it's a
[1:52:07] it's a a tradition passed on to them by
[1:52:09] their parents there's no Zeal to know
[1:52:12] the word for themselves no Zeal to know
[1:52:15] his truth they you know they're just
[1:52:18] satisfied with a denominational
[1:52:21] lifestyle
[1:52:23] what do you mean by that what is a
[1:52:25] denominational life just come to church
[1:52:27] pay your dues be a good person you know
[1:52:31] belong to something we belong to the
[1:52:33] Society of the church brother you're not
[1:52:37] this church ain't going in the Rapture
[1:52:39] it's going to be left behind but there's
[1:52:42] a bride that's going to be taken out of
[1:52:44] here and I say Lord don't let me fail I
[1:52:48] want to be in that bride I don't want to
[1:52:50] just be a member of a church
[1:52:53] and a lukewarm member and cold and
[1:52:55] former and with void of the power of God
[1:52:58] I want God in my life working in my life
[1:53:01] the power of God and
[1:53:03] salvation that's what I
[1:53:05] want oh yeah I'm not saying that there's
[1:53:08] that some right with God not for a
[1:53:10] minute there are many there are many
[1:53:12] raised up on a on a message Pew that
[1:53:15] come and and they too get that glorious
[1:53:18] New Birth but oh we must be careful that
[1:53:22] they original Fire doesn't burn down it
[1:53:25] doesn't matter even if we're oldtimers
[1:53:27] we got to make sure the log of the word
[1:53:30] of God is kept on our fires and we build
[1:53:33] up
[1:53:34] high amen that it be a flaming fire
[1:53:37] within our hearts amen that there's
[1:53:40] enough steam that is created by the fire
[1:53:43] within us it blows out the whistle and
[1:53:46] it drives down to healing and miracles
[1:53:49] and signs and wonders until it takes us
[1:53:51] into a r
[1:53:56] but you know how it is the fervent
[1:53:58] desire to please God that passion to
[1:54:00] know his word the cry for reaching out
[1:54:02] in the spirit it begins to fade and
[1:54:05] pretty soon the church instead a bit on
[1:54:08] fire with the fire of God becomes cooled
[1:54:11] off and a bit
[1:54:14] formal amen it's a little bit formal
[1:54:22] and the moment the moment that fire is
[1:54:25] even
[1:54:26] seen the moment there's even enough to
[1:54:28] blow it out the Whistle the moment it
[1:54:31] even happens it Dan somebody danc in the
[1:54:34] spirit somebody goes to call the fire
[1:54:37] department put the thing out we don't
[1:54:41] want no such nonsense as that around
[1:54:43] here we we don't want no fire in the in
[1:54:46] the engine you know that's Wildfire let
[1:54:49] me tell you it's fire it was lit by the
[1:54:51] fire of God and it's controlled by the
[1:54:54] Holy Spirit and it'll drive down the
[1:54:57] healing and the Miracles and the signs
[1:55:00] and
[1:55:04] wonders but that's what was happening in
[1:55:06] the Ephesian age they were getting a bit
[1:55:08] formal that abandonment to God was dying
[1:55:11] out and first thing you know people are
[1:55:13] not too careful about what God thought
[1:55:15] of
[1:55:17] them second generation like Israel
[1:55:20] and they demand the King now we don't
[1:55:23] call them Kings we make them Apostles we
[1:55:27] make them teachers we make them the
[1:55:29] Joshua next or this other one next you
[1:55:32] know the the the Aaron now you know
[1:55:35] whatever else all kinds of names we give
[1:55:37] them but it's a
[1:55:39] king so they can be like all the rest of
[1:55:42] the
[1:55:43] Nations you know again you know when the
[1:55:47] church starts thinking more of
[1:55:49] conforming to the world instead of
[1:55:51] conforming to God
[1:55:52] it didn't long you see them stop doing
[1:55:55] things they used to do and start doing
[1:55:57] things they wouldn't do initially and
[1:55:58] and first thing you know uh the spirit
[1:56:01] of worldliness comes in and they change
[1:56:03] their manner of dress and attitudes and
[1:56:06] behavior and they get relaxed and that's
[1:56:08] what Ephesus means is relaxed and
[1:56:12] drifting and let me quote from the
[1:56:14] prophet the cycle of Revival and death
[1:56:18] has never failed and he said all you
[1:56:21] have to do is look back to isusa Street
[1:56:24] just this last move and you can see that
[1:56:27] you know
[1:56:29] they they were they prayed all night
[1:56:31] they went to church they took on street
[1:56:33] corners they wern't ashamed of the
[1:56:35] manifestations of the spirit they left
[1:56:37] their own dead churches they worshiped
[1:56:40] in home and store buildings but they had
[1:56:44] reality it wasn't long until they got
[1:56:47] enough money to be able find new
[1:56:48] churches they put on a choir and a choir
[1:56:51] in s singing to God for themselves they
[1:56:54] put on gowns on the choir they organiz a
[1:56:57] movement ran it by man and soon they
[1:56:59] begin to read books it wasn't fit to
[1:57:01] read and they let down the bars and the
[1:57:02] goats come in and took it over and the
[1:57:04] cow of Joy was gone the freedom of the
[1:57:06] spirit was gone but oh they kept on with
[1:57:09] the form but all the fire had died down
[1:57:12] and the Blackness of Ashes is all about
[1:57:14] this
[1:57:15] left now God isn't against us having
[1:57:19] buildings
[1:57:22] places of
[1:57:23] worship God isn't even against a a group
[1:57:26] of you singing a song which we call a
[1:57:30] choir God's not against that but what
[1:57:34] he's against is when we lose the
[1:57:40] spirit when the spirit is no longer in
[1:57:43] our
[1:57:44] worship when the freedom of God is no
[1:57:47] longer in our
[1:57:48] praise you know the the Apostle John he
[1:57:52] was Apostle of love and he said this is
[1:57:55] the love of God that we keep his
[1:57:57] Commandments his word and so he knew
[1:58:00] what love was about so he said one
[1:58:02] little deviation from God from God's
[1:58:06] word was a step away from Christ and
[1:58:09] people say they they love God they go to
[1:58:11] church they will even shout and rejoice
[1:58:13] and sing and even a great emotional time
[1:58:16] but when it's all over watch and see if
[1:58:18] they're in that word walking in it
[1:58:20] living in it if they go through all the
[1:58:21] other and don't walk in that word they
[1:58:24] can say they love God but their lives
[1:58:26] tell a different story and he told me he
[1:58:29] said something was happening they were
[1:58:31] doing so suddenly you couldn't see it
[1:58:34] they hadn't made a move so big that you
[1:58:36] could that you could see it out there
[1:58:37] and the open it was under cover and they
[1:58:39] were bringing it by the way of reasoning
[1:58:41] and human understanding and it'll take
[1:58:44] over unless you refuse it go back to
[1:58:47] Pentecost before it's too
[1:58:49] late and he said but usually
[1:58:52] people as usual people don't heed God's
[1:58:56] warning and you know and and I'm going
[1:58:59] to tell you I'm going to tell you going
[1:59:02] back to Pentecost is not an
[1:59:04] option for many of them they ain't going
[1:59:07] to go
[1:59:09] there they ain't going they ain't going
[1:59:12] there they they're going to go as far
[1:59:14] away from there as they possibly can and
[1:59:16] I'm not even talking about isusa street
[1:59:19] I'm talking about Acts 2 Church being
[1:59:21] filled with the spirit power in fact
[1:59:23] this movement will fulfill the scripture
[1:59:26] listen to me carefully this movement
[1:59:29] will fulfill the scripture of having a
[1:59:33] form of godliness and denying the power
[1:59:42] thereof you will see it more and more
[1:59:46] you'll see the spirit of God move less
[1:59:48] and less you will see it in chains and
[1:59:53] put out and
[1:59:55] rejected I can show you and show you in
[1:59:57] the Bible is true Leo DEA shows that
[2:00:02] he's outside his own
[2:00:05] church knocking trying to get
[2:00:08] in
[2:00:10] amen and and I you know as I can share
[2:00:13] with you the the many quotes and I if I
[2:00:15] had the time and it looks like I'm I'm
[2:00:18] just going so slowly at this this
[2:00:21] morning so
[2:00:22] methodically trying to lay this down
[2:00:24] that I won't get to it but he said but
[2:00:26] he said Christ is on outside the door
[2:00:30] with
[2:00:31] Pentecost trying to get back in and
[2:00:35] we're not talking about isusa Street
[2:00:37] we're talking about the original word
[2:00:39] the original Power in the book of Acts
[2:00:44] church but they don't want
[2:00:50] it they forgot their origin the origin
[2:00:54] of the first age was Pentecost they had
[2:00:56] fallen from
[2:00:58] it he said theyve forgotten the glory
[2:01:01] The Wonder of it it was time to go back
[2:01:04] when he says remember remember go back
[2:01:07] and mind and the reality back to where
[2:01:10] it says for me to live as Christ back to
[2:01:13] Purity when Anis and the Safar and an i
[2:01:16] of fire were dealt with back to the gate
[2:01:18] called beautiful what a reproach it is
[2:01:20] to drift from God
[2:01:22] so what is the way back it's the way of
[2:01:25] repentance amen it's a it's a way of
[2:01:29] recognizing we we have went off in the
[2:01:31] wrong direction turn around and come
[2:01:34] back amen and you see that it would in
[2:01:38] Ephesus it would it would degrade it
[2:01:41] would go down and it would start dying
[2:01:43] and and even the city would long to the
[2:01:46] city was in ruined and his glorious
[2:01:48] temples a shapeless mass and the land
[2:01:51] become a
[2:01:52] uninhabited um uh Marsh inhabited by um
[2:01:56] a water fou the and the population was
[2:01:59] gone except for a few Believers in a
[2:02:01] squal village there wasn't one Christian
[2:02:04] left the lamp was rent from his
[2:02:08] place and he said don't mean she
[2:02:10] couldn't have repent and he said don't
[2:02:12] mean we can't
[2:02:13] repent we can but it must be quickly and
[2:02:17] it must be a true heart cry to God but
[2:02:20] let me just bring it forward now that
[2:02:22] was
[2:02:24] Ephesus but what if
[2:02:26] we and I'm reflecting again we've spent
[2:02:30] the last 60 Years
[2:02:33] Learning
[2:02:35] emphasizing the
[2:02:37] truths examining the
[2:02:41] mechanics with so little of the
[2:02:44] Dynamics
[2:02:47] until until as by by and large the
[2:02:51] message Community is out of
[2:02:54] balance today we're so afraid of the
[2:02:57] Dynamics until we'll dismiss it by
[2:03:00] saying well there's there's going to be
[2:03:02] a great deception in the last day with
[2:03:04] signs and wonders and and and and that
[2:03:07] will be preached to
[2:03:10] discourage signs and wonders among
[2:03:13] Believers when he said these signs shall
[2:03:16] follow them that believe but we'll point
[2:03:18] to the false and said watch out you'll
[2:03:20] be deceived by signs of Wonder but if
[2:03:22] you don't have them you are
[2:03:28] deceived how could you a Believer be a
[2:03:30] believer and not have signs and wonders
[2:03:32] among
[2:03:33] you come on Church you look at this for
[2:03:37] a moment and realize that we're we're
[2:03:39] we're quickly dis we'll quickly dismiss
[2:03:42] it because we'll pull out a
[2:03:46] Creed an established belief well the
[2:03:50] false the false brother Tim that false
[2:03:52] Vine they're going to have signs and
[2:03:54] wonders and miracles and we'll deceived
[2:03:56] by them that's
[2:03:58] right but why are you pointing to
[2:04:01] that amen why don't you point that the
[2:04:04] rain on the unjust was not even sent for
[2:04:08] them it was sent for the wheat the
[2:04:11] just and if they are rejoicing we ought
[2:04:14] to be rejoicing and if they are shouting
[2:04:17] over the anointing they get we ought to
[2:04:20] have the anointing and Shout over what
[2:04:22] we
[2:04:23] [Applause]
[2:04:28] have so what if it produces a faith in
[2:04:31] them that they can make that part of the
[2:04:33] way word work we ought to be making all
[2:04:35] of the word
[2:04:40] work and if there is worship shouting
[2:04:44] and rejoicing well that's just emotion
[2:04:46] and and it ain't in
[2:04:48] emotions let me tell you brother Brandon
[2:04:50] brought a correction because Pent the of
[2:04:53] meetings where we full of emotion and
[2:04:56] relying on emotions and denying the word
[2:04:59] but we're not word
[2:05:01] deniers we're word Believers and if
[2:05:04] there's anybody ought to have some joy
[2:05:06] and shouting and rejoicing come on it's
[2:05:09] the mo it's not a new found religion it
[2:05:12] ain't just some phenomenal you got at
[2:05:14] Youth Camp it's the oldest religion
[2:05:16] there ever was because in the mind of
[2:05:19] God he saw you shouting and
[2:05:27] rejoicing and if there's healing and
[2:05:29] miracles they're dismissed because false
[2:05:32] anointed have them see we got the word
[2:05:35] well if you really had the word you'd
[2:05:36] have
[2:05:37] Miracles if God be with you then where
[2:05:40] are the
[2:05:41] Miracles amen now you know some will get
[2:05:44] get their nose all out of joint with me
[2:05:46] preaching that and said well brother Tim
[2:05:48] you're you're making like you're the
[2:05:49] only one that's got miracles no I am not
[2:05:52] doing no such a thing you know don't
[2:05:54] take all the medicine on the Shelf if
[2:05:56] that ain't for you well then realize
[2:05:59] it's for somebody
[2:06:02] else amen but you see you you see again
[2:06:07] again we're we're right here in this
[2:06:09] time if there's prophecies or
[2:06:11] manifestation of the gifts of spirit
[2:06:13] they're quickly dismiss as
[2:06:15] Pentecostalism baby stuff immature and
[2:06:18] you'll be told real quickly gifts are on
[2:06:21] the Shelf and the prophet put him there
[2:06:23] how dare you to take them
[2:06:26] off well that's a lie of the devil and I
[2:06:30] don't care who said it it's a lie of the
[2:06:34] devil the prophet of God never preached
[2:06:37] that never taught that and if he did he
[2:06:39] was contradicting what Paul preached and
[2:06:41] he's
[2:06:43] cursed and he couldn't do
[2:06:48] that it's so Li the devil the prophet
[2:06:50] never put the gifts of the Spirit on the
[2:06:53] Shelf he did say that one glorious day
[2:06:58] when the preaching the day of preaching
[2:07:00] is
[2:07:01] over listen carefully when the day of
[2:07:04] preaching is over that there would they
[2:07:07] would be laid on the mantle and divine
[2:07:10] love would heal
[2:07:12] everybody and of course Divine Love Is
[2:07:16] Heaven brother R when he went beyond a
[2:07:19] garden of time he said this he said
[2:07:21] everything was just full of with perfect
[2:07:23] love he said this is what you preach is
[2:07:24] the Holy Ghost he said and So Divine
[2:07:27] love is heaven and and all that is there
[2:07:30] it is the Holy Ghost and when we are
[2:07:33] changed we will not need preaching
[2:07:37] anymore every preaching gift will be
[2:07:39] laid on The
[2:07:42] Mantel well brother Tim I can't wait
[2:07:45] till we get to heaven man you'll have
[2:07:47] eternity to preach no I'll hang it up
[2:07:51] amen amen I'll not do any preaching you
[2:07:54] won't need preaching for you will all
[2:07:56] know him from the least to the
[2:08:00] greatest amen amen and and so you know
[2:08:05] again knowledge will
[2:08:08] cease am the need to expound deep
[2:08:11] Mysteries will be
[2:08:13] over we will know as we are known
[2:08:17] tongues that need to be interpreted will
[2:08:20] no longer be
[2:08:22] needed prophecies will cease and prayer
[2:08:26] for the sick will no longer be offered
[2:08:29] thank
[2:08:33] God Amen but that ain't
[2:08:35] now right now we're still preaching and
[2:08:39] as long as there's preaching there's
[2:08:41] laying hands on the sick and they shall
[2:08:44] recover as long as there's preaching
[2:08:46] there are altar calls and people getting
[2:08:49] the Holy Ghost as long as there is pre
[2:08:51] preaching there is prophecy as long as
[2:08:54] there's preaching there's tongues and
[2:08:57] interpretation as long as there is
[2:08:59] preaching the Full Gospel is in
[2:09:02] effect but when we're perfected no one
[2:09:06] will need to prophesy to you the
[2:09:14] future of course when brother bandam
[2:09:16] said that in
[2:09:19] 1957 none of the gifts were laid on the
[2:09:22] manle none of them he continued to
[2:09:26] prophesy again and again almost in every
[2:09:29] service when Danny Henry would prophesy
[2:09:32] over him in pure French and it would be
[2:09:35] interpreted right Gifts of healing
[2:09:39] continued prayer lines continued and
[2:09:42] they should today because the gifts are
[2:09:45] not on the M they are always to be in
[2:09:49] the
[2:09:49] church and it do matter how impersonated
[2:09:53] they have been amen that there is as
[2:09:56] brother bam would say that here the
[2:09:59] gifts that returned to church that's
[2:10:01] Divine Healing prophecy speaking with
[2:10:03] tongues interpretation and though it's
[2:10:05] been misrepresented terrifically yet
[2:10:08] that don't take away there's a good one
[2:10:11] there's a true one of a genuine real
[2:10:14] genuine gift of speaking in tongues is
[2:10:17] always supposed to be in the church we
[2:10:20] are always to be an Apostolic
[2:10:23] order the days of the Apostles is not
[2:10:26] over days of Miracles are not passed
[2:10:29] Divine Healing is not over gifts and
[2:10:32] miracles are not finished there's still
[2:10:35] Miracles ready to happen May
[2:10:38] 2025 be a year of Miracles where we see
[2:10:42] God move in signs and wonders and
[2:10:44] healings and deliverance and people
[2:10:47] filled with the spirit
[2:10:55] yet it's the devil's job to
[2:11:00] distorted Apostle Paul he set the church
[2:11:04] in order and he taught the proper use of
[2:11:07] the gifts of the Spirit and confirmed
[2:11:10] that they were to remain in the church
[2:11:11] till Jesus came direct
[2:11:15] quote so it must be that if you will
[2:11:19] study and I'll give you a little
[2:11:20] homework
[2:11:22] go back and listen to the five definite
[2:11:24] identifications of the True Church of
[2:11:26] the Living God you'll find out what kind
[2:11:29] of church where to be you'll find this
[2:11:32] must be in the church because if the
[2:11:35] vine puts forth another Branch it will
[2:11:37] write another book of Acts behind
[2:11:40] it and of course if we're just a branch
[2:11:42] off of some denomination we'll just
[2:11:45] produce a denominational life but if we
[2:11:48] are a branch of the original tree we're
[2:11:51] going to write a book of Acts not the
[2:11:54] you say well brother Tim the acts of man
[2:11:56] no the acts of the Holy Ghost
[2:12:00] inen that's what we're talking about cuz
[2:12:03] if the vine ever brings forth another
[2:12:06] branch of itself that Branch will be
[2:12:08] exactly like the vine itself it'll be
[2:12:10] the it'll be the same kind of branch
[2:12:12] that brought forth at Pentecost it will
[2:12:15] speak in tongues prophesy have the power
[2:12:18] and signs of the resurrected Jesus
[2:12:20] Christ in it why because it's thriving
[2:12:24] on the natural resource of the V Vine
[2:12:26] itself you see it wasn't grafted in the
[2:12:28] vine it was born in the
[2:12:35] vine but instead of the pure word and
[2:12:40] they'll scream stay with the word stay
[2:12:42] with the word stay it's the word it's
[2:12:43] the word it's the word and we wind up
[2:12:46] with message
[2:12:48] Creeds statements of Doctrine
[2:12:51] that are only founded on partial
[2:12:55] truths for example let me give you an
[2:12:59] example here's a here's here's a Creed
[2:13:03] it's the Creed of most all
[2:13:07] protestantism it's in their Apostles
[2:13:10] Creed for example baptism using titles
[2:13:14] of Father Son and Holy Ghost are Creeds
[2:13:17] of
[2:13:18] denomination formed by taking one one
[2:13:21] quote of Jesus and not taking the rest
[2:13:24] of the
[2:13:26] scripture and the improper use of quotes
[2:13:31] as righteous and holy are as they
[2:13:33] are and true as they are makes
[2:13:40] Creeds and these Creeds are used to bind
[2:13:44] the Holy
[2:13:47] Spirit and this makes a hybrid gospel
[2:13:50] which has no life in
[2:13:53] it that means it's
[2:13:56] dead and
[2:13:58] dying
[2:14:00] now again you know the the rest of the
[2:14:03] scripture if you take Acts chapter 238
[2:14:05] repent to every one of you be baptized
[2:14:07] in the name of Jesus Christ remission of
[2:14:09] sin you shall receive the gift of the
[2:14:10] Holy Ghost you will see their house of
[2:14:12] Cornus they baptized in the name of
[2:14:14] Jesus Christ Acts 19 I can take you
[2:14:17] through through every place in the Bible
[2:14:19] where they were baptized and they were
[2:14:22] all baptized using the
[2:14:24] name of Jesus
[2:14:27] Christ because you had to recognize God
[2:14:30] in the manifestation of his
[2:14:33] deity and he came as Jehovah the Savior
[2:14:38] Jesus Thou shalt call his name Jesus for
[2:14:43] he will save his people from their sins
[2:14:46] and quoting the Bible there is no
[2:14:49] salvation in any other
[2:14:52] name but Creeds have changed
[2:14:59] it and guess what they bind people from
[2:15:03] receiving the Holy
[2:15:07] Ghost now so brother Brandon was very
[2:15:11] careful about this he told us that the
[2:15:15] spoken word the word was the original
[2:15:16] seed that was the original but it would
[2:15:19] then become hybrid it would be become
[2:15:22] mixed and he said to mix would bring a
[2:15:25] hybrid crop a hybrid crop is a dead crop
[2:15:29] go as far as rebreeding because it can't
[2:15:31] breed itself back right it won't rebreed
[2:15:34] itself and and and so you you see um it
[2:15:39] the church right there will die because
[2:15:41] it will hybrid itself and it gets mixed
[2:15:44] and you can't do nothing with it it's
[2:15:46] dead and that's why listen each
[2:15:49] generation has its own Revival a chance
[2:15:52] of the word why because every age will
[2:15:56] rise up and they'll mix it they'll have
[2:15:59] fallen angels get in it and the next
[2:16:01] thing you know is a powerless
[2:16:04] religion next thing you know it's built
[2:16:06] on
[2:16:08] Creeds and it's hybridized and it's dead
[2:16:12] and the spirit moves it and so another
[2:16:14] generation gets a fresh
[2:16:18] Revival it's own chance of the word
[2:16:21] and that way you know brother brandham
[2:16:23] said you know um he said the Catholics
[2:16:27] will raise up behind Luther or or
[2:16:29] irenius Martin poop and those will stand
[2:16:32] for judgment for H breing the word to
[2:16:34] dogmas this group of lutherans that
[2:16:36] fought Lutheran's Revival will answer
[2:16:38] the same thing that booted group of
[2:16:40] Baptists that followed John Smith's
[2:16:42] Revival will do the same Alexander
[2:16:44] camels will do the same and the
[2:16:46] Pentecostal will do the same that
[2:16:49] original Revival when the Holy SC fell
[2:16:51] called out of people and God's trying to
[2:16:53] get it get his word to it and they
[2:16:55] organized it and sat over here and
[2:16:58] denominated and it died and but every
[2:17:01] generation has to have its Revival and
[2:17:04] God raises up a man sets him with his
[2:17:07] word starts him on with a message of
[2:17:09] that age and soon as that man is taken
[2:17:12] off the scene somebody else catches it
[2:17:15] and hybrids it this is the
[2:17:18] cycle somebody else catches it and hbes
[2:17:22] it mixes it go back exactly that's the
[2:17:24] way it started all the way back to
[2:17:27] Genesis God set forth this crop of human
[2:17:30] race and Eve hiber it so see what
[2:17:33] happened so there's judgment for Eve Now
[2:17:36] Eve was not eternally lost that but it
[2:17:39] said death in the human race and the
[2:17:42] promised Heaven of an Eden was lost and
[2:17:44] man's vision and contact with God become
[2:17:47] uh clouded and
[2:17:49] obscured so you see each generation is
[2:17:54] receiving because it's repeating right
[2:17:56] back to Adam and Eve again so God will
[2:17:59] bring a Revival and they'll start off
[2:18:01] with
[2:18:02] freshness all new and there'll be new
[2:18:06] churches and the gospel May spread and
[2:18:09] there will be that message will go out
[2:18:12] but if they don't stay pure with the
[2:18:14] word it don't take long no not hardly a
[2:18:18] generation to where it becomes
[2:18:21] hybridized and watered down and diluted
[2:18:25] and the methodists who got the
[2:18:27] experience were were of sanctification
[2:18:30] where they shouted and rejoiced and fall
[2:18:33] out under the spirit and they take water
[2:18:36] and pour it in their faces to bring them
[2:18:37] up brother Brandon said if they had let
[2:18:39] them alone they went all the way through
[2:18:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost but they
[2:18:43] didn't and and and and yet they would
[2:18:46] they would raise up great men that that
[2:18:49] you hear of like buddy Rock
[2:18:51] and others that would Herald the message
[2:18:54] faith and would carry the gospel light
[2:18:58] at that time but another generation
[2:19:00] would rise and another generation and
[2:19:03] the next thing you know we don't want
[2:19:05] those camp meeting experiences we we
[2:19:08] that that's undignified that don't fit
[2:19:10] in our churches we no longer want that
[2:19:13] to happen where people get excited about
[2:19:16] the salvation and and overflow and
[2:19:19] whatever you can just come and make a
[2:19:21] confession of faith and we sprinkle you
[2:19:23] with a few drops of water and you're
[2:19:25] Sanctified and they're still living
[2:19:27] every kind of dirty lives until the
[2:19:30] churches are full of every kind of
[2:19:33] Sin from sodomites all the way
[2:19:40] down and you know that's the
[2:19:43] truth why every generation has Revival
[2:19:51] brother Jason this a quote you sent me
[2:19:54] but in the face of all of that there's a
[2:19:57] real bride God spring him
[2:19:59] forth each time there's been a
[2:20:01] Reformation there's been so much of the
[2:20:03] words spread forth and each generation
[2:20:05] gets his time did you ever notice there
[2:20:08] be a man of God come along that'll
[2:20:10] strike fire with God and there'll be a
[2:20:12] great Revival sweep the land and what
[2:20:14] happens immediately after they take
[2:20:16] man's ideas and denominate it and bring
[2:20:19] in Creeds and mix it there she dies and
[2:20:21] never rises again it's always been
[2:20:24] always will be every time but each
[2:20:26] generation what does it get it's
[2:20:29] opportunity at a fresh word of God each
[2:20:32] time like Luther under justification
[2:20:34] like Wesley under sanctification the
[2:20:36] Pentecostal move on the baptism of the
[2:20:38] Holy Ghost see each one gets its chance
[2:20:41] then what does men do that follows those
[2:20:43] great reformers denominate it organize
[2:20:46] it mix Creeds with it a little bit here
[2:20:49] and a little bit there a new bunch of
[2:20:51] School Scholars coming along with a
[2:20:53] bunch of
[2:20:55] psychology just the same as he was
[2:20:57] trying to find some new light to mix up
[2:21:00] with the word of God death and Away went
[2:21:03] the organization and died spiritually
[2:21:05] and that's EXA right has always been and
[2:21:10] church it repeats itself and is
[2:21:13] continually repeating itself as brother
[2:21:16] brandham said if you notice though every
[2:21:19] three years after a great meeting what
[2:21:21] takes place a
[2:21:22] denomination now actually it would
[2:21:26] be it would be the Armenians would join
[2:21:29] in with theza Street the next big one
[2:21:31] would be the Church of God uh would join
[2:21:34] in and accept Thea blessing and the next
[2:21:37] one the Assembly of God would be formed
[2:21:39] seven years after 1906 and 1913 or 14
[2:21:43] and so s years later here you got the
[2:21:45] first organization and he says if I dear
[2:21:49] dying lamb he said this is 20 years and
[2:21:52] no denomination dear dying lamb may it
[2:21:55] never do that if I go in this generation
[2:21:59] May the people who believe this message
[2:22:01] never stand still for a denomination you
[2:22:04] will die right in your
[2:22:08] track wow I can I can
[2:22:14] hear as he said the very hour you
[2:22:16] mentioned denomination among you I don't
[2:22:19] care how sincere you are take Man For
[2:22:21] Your Leader instead of the Holy Spirit
[2:22:23] to confirm his word that's the hour you
[2:22:25] die now the genuine seed cannot because
[2:22:27] there's nothing left after the seed it's
[2:22:30] the same thing that was at the be back
[2:22:32] at the beginning it's the bride that
[2:22:34] fell into the ground to bring forth the
[2:22:35] corn of weat again so you see as as
[2:22:39] brother Bram would say as he preached
[2:22:40] the church ages he says and he talks
[2:22:44] about the nicians and he says oh and
[2:22:48] I'll show you the Messenger to this
[2:22:51] church age will hate
[2:22:55] denominations the spirit will raise up
[2:22:58] in the children it's always
[2:23:06] been the messenger would hate it but the
[2:23:12] spirit would raise up in his
[2:23:14] children ah you know I can hear some of
[2:23:18] your they ain't know denomination in
[2:23:20] this message brother Tim ain't nobody
[2:23:23] nobody would dare to sign up a piece of
[2:23:25] paper and and draw draw up a charter and
[2:23:27] do that it's not the
[2:23:32] paper it's the
[2:23:35] spirit it's like I tell people about
[2:23:37] divorce they come all worried because in
[2:23:40] order to make a man pay the child
[2:23:43] support a woman I have to sue a husband
[2:23:45] for for divorce so oh brother Tim God
[2:23:48] hates that God doesn't hate that he
[2:23:50] don't hate that paper that ain't what
[2:23:52] God hates God hates that behavior that's
[2:23:55] he he hates it when a man will abandon
[2:23:59] his wife or wife or husband and leave
[2:24:02] the word of God and destroy a home
[2:24:05] that's what God hates he hates the
[2:24:08] behavior that that that leads up to the
[2:24:13] divorce it Ain it ain't the
[2:24:15] paper it's your be it's your
[2:24:18] actions that's what God said I hate
[2:24:21] putting
[2:24:22] away amen I hate that I despise that I I
[2:24:26] want my people to be whole I want
[2:24:28] families behold I don't want children
[2:24:30] raised up without a daddy or mother I I
[2:24:33] don't want divided
[2:24:34] families but the devil gets
[2:24:37] in and pulls them
[2:24:41] apart oh W you know if you sign this
[2:24:44] paper that's what God hates no it ain't
[2:24:45] sign in the paper it was your wicked
[2:24:48] Deeds
[2:24:53] and that's the same thing it's the
[2:24:57] spirit nobody's going to draw up a paper
[2:24:59] they wouldn't
[2:25:03] dare they wouldn't
[2:25:05] dare but they got the spirit of
[2:25:10] it and brother brandham tells us in the
[2:25:13] world falling
[2:25:14] apart that God will raise up a prophet
[2:25:18] and he
[2:25:19] says and and he says let me just read it
[2:25:22] he said just exactly what Jesus said
[2:25:25] when he come to the Earth he said God
[2:25:27] sent them prophets down to the age every
[2:25:30] time that the world system would fall
[2:25:32] apart the religious system and what did
[2:25:34] you do with him God sent a prophet you
[2:25:36] put him in a tomb exactly and then after
[2:25:39] another generation you wake up realize
[2:25:41] that was a prophet and then what do you
[2:25:42] do you garnish the tomb what do you do
[2:25:45] make a tradition of his life and that's
[2:25:48] exactly what Israel has done had taken
[2:25:50] the prophet Moses and had made a
[2:25:52] tradition of his life and that's the way
[2:25:54] we do Martin Martin Luther John Wesley
[2:25:57] other men and we're always looking back
[2:25:59] and see those things and you make a
[2:26:01] tradition of their life and garnish the
[2:26:03] tombs of them and their their message
[2:26:05] was for another day and by the time you
[2:26:07] wake up that day is done live by and
[2:26:09] we're in another
[2:26:14] day and that's exactly what has
[2:26:16] happened is that you know God used a man
[2:26:19] in this generation and we garnish his
[2:26:22] tomb and we we talk about his life and
[2:26:24] his ministry and what he was and what he
[2:26:26] did and we we make a you know we we make
[2:26:29] a great man of him and a tradition out
[2:26:31] of his
[2:26:40] life and now that same vicious cycle
[2:26:44] begins as we begin to
[2:26:47] hybrid but let me just say this
[2:26:53] I want to bring this
[2:26:54] down but God has said he will restore
[2:26:59] and he'll have a church without spot a
[2:27:03] wrinkle and it will not only be the word
[2:27:06] even manifested the power for to be the
[2:27:09] true word it has to be spirit and in
[2:27:12] truth and this is where there again
[2:27:15] there where Satan gets in to make it all
[2:27:17] mechanics and no Dynamics are back all
[2:27:20] Dynamics and no mechanics but we got to
[2:27:22] get it
[2:27:23] together and I am not in all at any W
[2:27:26] you're saying forfeit the word for the
[2:27:29] Dynamics I'm saying if you got the word
[2:27:32] then let it
[2:27:34] work and that's a Capstone that I'm
[2:27:37] talking about it ain't going to be
[2:27:40] another man raising up with another
[2:27:43] message amen when you come to the top
[2:27:46] there ain't nothing to follow it
[2:27:50] and we've come through seven ages and
[2:27:52] there's not another to follow it I don't
[2:27:54] care and you know it'll go every one of
[2:27:55] them will go down into death there'll
[2:27:57] not be another man rise another Joshua
[2:28:00] another Moses another this another that
[2:28:03] you can name whatever it's
[2:28:06] finished and like it or not I didn't
[2:28:09] like it I'll just tell you I didn't like
[2:28:11] it and I still don't like
[2:28:14] it but God ended the seventh Angel's
[2:28:17] Ministry and took him home
[2:28:21] I didn't take him out of the pulpit God
[2:28:26] did and I can't put him back in the
[2:28:29] pulpit and nobody else can and playing
[2:28:33] his tapes will not put him in the
[2:28:36] Pulpit do you hear me amen you know
[2:28:40] again Traditions they will make
[2:28:43] traditions out of the message to where
[2:28:46] even the gift of ministry is denied
[2:28:51] what is that it is hybridizing what we
[2:28:54] have you you saywell brother Tim you've
[2:28:57] spent time this morning talking about
[2:28:58] Fallen Angels that's true but always
[2:29:02] remember there's going to be
[2:29:05] somebody that is going to be true there
[2:29:08] is somebody going to be faithful there
[2:29:11] is somebody going to rightly divide the
[2:29:14] word of Truth
[2:29:20] spoke with a dear friend one time whose
[2:29:22] son was a minister he said well brother
[2:29:26] he sat me down he said listen Tim want
[2:29:28] to find out about you my daughter comes
[2:29:30] to your church I said
[2:29:33] yeah we're happy to have them and he
[2:29:36] said
[2:29:37] well I want to let you know to begin
[2:29:39] with I don't believe in
[2:29:43] Preachers I said
[2:29:46] oh I said that ain't true
[2:29:52] and he looked back at me he said listen
[2:29:55] you don't know what I've been through
[2:29:57] I've had preachers lie to
[2:29:59] me
[2:30:01] thevery I've had them deceive and
[2:30:04] they're all about their self money women
[2:30:06] are
[2:30:07] popularity and he says I don't believe
[2:30:10] in
[2:30:13] Preachers and I guess I know what I
[2:30:15] believe and I said that isn't true
[2:30:21] and he looked back at me and he said
[2:30:24] well it is too
[2:30:26] true I said then you got a bigger
[2:30:29] problem than I
[2:30:32] thought because if that's true your God
[2:30:35] is a little bitty God and you ain't
[2:30:38] serving the one I'm
[2:30:41] serving he looked at me and he said oh
[2:30:44] how so I said because if your God isn't
[2:30:47] able to keep a Ministry true
[2:30:51] if you're God who put it in the church I
[2:30:54] give you Apostles prophets teachers
[2:30:56] evangelists and pastors I I'll put I'll
[2:30:58] put them I'll put even New Testament
[2:31:01] prophets in the church I I'll have them
[2:31:03] all they will be in my church I I'm
[2:31:07] going away but I'm sending gifts back to
[2:31:09] men and if God can't keep a true one
[2:31:11] then he's a little bitty God and he
[2:31:14] ain't able to keep his word and I'm
[2:31:16] telling you if God isn't able to keep a
[2:31:19] bride without SP BTO Rico or blemish and
[2:31:21] have a people for his name's sake he's a
[2:31:23] little bitty
[2:31:25] God but my God is big enough in the most
[2:31:29] evil age in the most wicked generation
[2:31:32] to have a people standing on the earth
[2:31:35] who believe all the word who stand for
[2:31:37] the truth in the
[2:31:40] hour I said God has to have
[2:31:44] somebody and I'm telling you this
[2:31:46] morning we made Ain all lost and it
[2:31:49] ain't all gone there's a real bright
[2:31:51] somewhere there's somebody going to
[2:31:54] believe the word there's somebody going
[2:31:56] to receive the truth in this hour
[2:31:58] there's somebody who's not only going to
[2:32:01] have the mechanics and believe all the
[2:32:03] word but have the Dynamics to go with it
[2:32:06] thank God for 60 years of teaching but
[2:32:10] oh time friends it's time now for The
[2:32:12] Headstone to unite with the body and
[2:32:14] when that full power of the Holy Ghost
[2:32:16] comes upon that body it'll be a
[2:32:19] refilling of the holy ghost that we
[2:32:21] worked in a small measure as a Capstone
[2:32:23] was coming down but then amen it it'll
[2:32:27] come and sat down upon that church and
[2:32:29] even the dead in Christ for seven years
[2:32:31] seven ages will rise up and we'll all go
[2:32:36] up to meet
[2:32:40] him that's my New Year's Message Church
[2:32:44] it'll be the stone though the builders
[2:32:46] will disallow it'll be the it'll be the
[2:32:50] one where they will crucify the
[2:32:53] word amen that they will crucify the
[2:32:56] effects of the word they won't say the
[2:32:59] word is wrong they'll just crucify his
[2:33:01] effects they will say it was oh oh it
[2:33:04] was for yesterday it was for another
[2:33:06] time but it's not today but I'm going to
[2:33:08] tell you he's the same yesterday today
[2:33:11] and forever the Lord Our God who changes
[2:33:13] not and he's here today to perform his
[2:33:16] word just like he always did

[2:33:42] message will do like they did 2,000
[2:33:45] years
[2:33:46] ago when they called for his blood
[2:33:50] and crucified
[2:33:52] him not him as a
[2:33:55] person the word by killing the effects
[2:34:00] of the
[2:34:02] word oh yeah you can go back and listen
[2:34:05] to the indictment there's some homework
[2:34:08] go back and listen to the Leo to
[2:34:11] cnh there's you some
[2:34:14] homework I'm talking about his brother
[2:34:16] Brandon priesthood go back and listen to
[2:34:18] it he he will tell you exactly what will
[2:34:21] happen in this last day remember it was
[2:34:24] there it was there when he would
[2:34:27] standing there even a message of Grace
[2:34:30] where you'd see the seven rainbows and
[2:34:32] all of that and it would be it would be
[2:34:34] experience like that in Sportsman Hollow
[2:34:37] where that he would receive the
[2:34:38] revelation of the seven Church ages and
[2:34:41] and see its Messengers and write it out
[2:34:43] and he would come out from there you
[2:34:45] watch what I'm saying go back and search
[2:34:47] it yourself it would be from there he
[2:34:49] would come out and say Malachi 4 has to
[2:34:51] be fulfilled an Elijah has to come to
[2:34:54] restore the word
[2:34:59] back and under that Elijah Ministry he
[2:35:02] come out and he preached of church ages
[2:35:05] showing us where we'd got off and
[2:35:07] bringing us on a long journey to where
[2:35:09] we are in the leoan age and then he
[2:35:11] would come and he' say okay the last
[2:35:14] stage they will put Christ
[2:35:18] out said when I I saw it I laid over on
[2:35:22] my chair and wept like a
[2:35:24] baby the very one who gave his
[2:35:28] life and they crucified him and turned
[2:35:31] him away they will do the same
[2:35:35] thing and he said it'll be
[2:35:37] Jesus again with dirty
[2:35:41] feet unwanted unw
[2:35:45] unaccepted nobody to pour that will pour
[2:35:48] fragrance upon him
[2:35:50] wash the dirt that his smile smashed on
[2:35:53] his name Holy Roller you old
[2:35:57] Pentecostal whatever else wash all that
[2:36:00] dirt off of
[2:36:02] him me like our brother preached the
[2:36:05] other day become one with that anointing
[2:36:07] and that anointing that you anointed him
[2:36:09] with becomes on you his anointing comes
[2:36:12] on your
[2:36:15] life it'll be it'll be wrong Romans chap
[2:36:20] 11 you see we are living in the
[2:36:24] Fulfillment of the
[2:36:25] Gentiles when the Gentile dispensation
[2:36:28] is fulfilled that's when the seven
[2:36:30] Church ages will be
[2:36:32] over and until then we're still in the
[2:36:34] seventh
[2:36:37] age guess who else who else is going to
[2:36:40] wear the white
[2:36:43] robe who else is going to be the
[2:36:45] Overcomer who else is going to have the
[2:36:48] gold who else else is going to sit on
[2:36:50] the throne the bride in Le
[2:36:53] oia an elect
[2:36:56] lady the living in this last
[2:36:59] age let me just look for a moment Revel
[2:37:02] Romans 11 he talks about how the gospel
[2:37:07] is turned to the
[2:37:08] Gentiles until the fullness of the
[2:37:10] Gentiles come in and he said God took
[2:37:14] and grafted On A Wild Olive
[2:37:17] Branch and he says that was you Gentiles
[2:37:22] he said you have no reason to boast it
[2:37:24] was the grace of God that put you in the
[2:37:29] vine but he said one day the fullness
[2:37:32] will come and he says the Gentiles will
[2:37:35] be cut off and the gosp the the branch
[2:37:39] will put forth another and that Branch
[2:37:42] will be again the gospel turned into the
[2:37:44] Jews now he said why were they cut off
[2:37:48] because Jesus said you make fun of me
[2:37:51] you ridicule me and he said it'll be
[2:37:54] forgiven but when the when the Holy
[2:37:57] Ghost comes to say a word against it he
[2:38:00] said you you you it will not be forgiven
[2:38:04] in this world or the world to come and
[2:38:06] he said that day at Pentecost when the
[2:38:09] Holy Spirit was poured out and they
[2:38:12] mocked it and made fun and said it's
[2:38:14] some kind of new wine and ridiculed this
[2:38:18] what God was doing he said they
[2:38:20] blasphemed the Holy Ghost and God cut
[2:38:22] him off and he said the same thing Jesus
[2:38:26] is trying to get back in the church with
[2:38:31] Pentecost not isza Street they were in
[2:38:36] Pentecost with
[2:38:39] Pentecost and they close him out and
[2:38:43] they want let him in and they re
[2:38:45] ridicule it and they make fun of it
[2:38:48] altar calls and prayer lines and worship
[2:38:52] and shouting and dancing of the spirit
[2:38:54] and they dismiss it let me tell you
[2:38:57] they're blaspheming the Holy Ghost and
[2:38:59] they will go into the
[2:39:02] tribulation for
[2:39:04] purging whether they make it there or
[2:39:06] not I don't know but that's why he cut
[2:39:09] off the Jewish and that's why he will
[2:39:12] cut off the
[2:39:17] Gentiles and we're here at a time time
[2:39:20] where the spirit will be lifting
[2:39:27] everywhere let me
[2:39:29] prophesy the spirit will lift from
[2:39:32] churches yes even message churches even
[2:39:35] more and they will just go on into
[2:39:37] formalism Creeds traditions of
[2:39:43] man I want to tell you the message
[2:39:46] movement will die amen
[2:39:51] but not the
[2:39:53] message but not the message the message
[2:39:57] is God the message is the word and the
[2:40:00] message will live on the message cannot
[2:40:02] be stumped out and pushed out amen the
[2:40:04] message cannot be deprived it cannot be
[2:40:08] rejected it will be accepted by somebody
[2:40:11] and somebody's going to be that bride
[2:40:13] who is married to the lamb and United
[2:40:16] with him and carried home
