the hearts and lives of your children let her bring healing and deliverance Lord whether it be in the realm of the spirit the mind whether it be the realm of the Soul that would need saving or whether it be in the realm of the body the flesh that gets so weary and weak now father we're your children today and we are asking for your grace upon us as we would read your word together we pray that you would anoint your hearts make it live step out of the pages of the Bible walk here among us today reveal yourself to the word Lord and may we oh God take that word to our heart and become one with it Lord I pray for the little bride around the world those that are listening into Lord I pray that you would bless them in a mighty way our shut-ins that aren't able to be here some in nursing homes and different places but Lord you are there you're with them because you said I'll never leave you a forsake you and I pray that you'll meet them in a very special way today that you'll just come down lord to wherever they are in their room and minister to them in a special way I pray God for these that are here in the church some of them have great burdens upon their lives and we ask the Lord that you would just lift those burdens today as we cast all our cares upon you because we are assured you care for us in Jesus name amen amen God bless you amen isn't it good to be in the house of the Lord today is this a place that we have dedicated to him and thanks be to God for his goodness amen so appreciated brother Craig praying a moment ago and happy to have him sister Anna and the whole family here with us today and um also brother Kenneth is back there my goodness that shining face I love you brother Kenneth God bless you and we're so happy that you was able to come today and um you know he's uh I've been close to death a number of times but he's still here this morning and amen is a testimony of the grace of God and his healing power so we thank the Lord for that also um brother Timothy and I will be leaving for Germany on Wednesday May the 24th that's just coming up and we'll be going through Wednesday May 31st so be in prayer for us there's special meetings there and um as brother gerd wrote a walled and so um you know in some 25 years ago I think it was we were part of his dedication services so we're back again to try to be a blessing to the people there so you know what it is when others come here and what a blessing they are to us amen so we in turn you know want to be able to be a blessing there Genesis chapter 18 verse 9. and uh praying that God will bless you in a very special way today as we look into his word and look for his anointing upon it a man that God will speak to you in a very personal way today Genesis 18 verse 9 and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he will he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were well old and well-stricken in AIDS and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old and shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of assured he bear a child which I'm old is there anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son and then Sarah denied saying I laugh not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou did US life God bless you can be seated today I want to speak on changing our heart our mouth and our confession I touched a nerve last time I ministered I preached on Sarah what's your tongue you see God's word must be believed and like the old woman Sarah sitting in her unbelief scoffing at the promise her heart had to be changed from doubting to believing and it took the manifestation of God in the form of a man to discern her heart and turn it from the unbelief and that it held her it's so great and unbelief that in fact it was years of accumulated unbelief that that she when she would hear it from God himself she would actually scoff or laugh in the face of an all-knowing God and then try to cover it up by lying we went through it last week of the quotes for brother Branham said God would should have killed her right there but he said he couldn't do it because she's part of Abraham and he said the same with us the grace of God holds us even in our moments of unbelief and are doubting and confusion and and we had you to listen to the sermon speak to this mountain in San Jose where brother Branham you know went over the the third pull of his ministry and God was trying to show him the truth of Mark 11 23 and and the speaking of the word and and he you know I stumbled over that and disbelieved it and said well it wasn't even in the atonement and and so on because of unbelief that he had to even struggle and to believe that that scripture could be for us and then God trying to show it to him and steal in all of those moments of bumbling and stumbling and questioning and doubting and disbelieving and whatever else but God's grace overrode all of that amen and still honored the words of a man that was that spoke things into creation and and so it gives us a lot of Hope for ourselves when we realize that we how weak we are as human beings and how often that we doubt and Ponder and question and you know second guess and and uh uh doubt the promises of God and you know and so I'm like Sarah you know the old the woman the old woman the church she's not been Barren for 2 000 years and she's been waiting on the promised son and for Jesus to return and and um she receives a visitation to turn her heart from acute years of accumulated doubts of misinterpreted Theology and unbelief back to the faith of when she was a young girl a young church so that she in her heart must return to being the bride that she was at Pentecost and remember you know I I can think of her you know remember what it was like to skip like a young girl to Sport with your husband uh remember what it was like to laugh and rejoice Sarah You're gonna laugh again you don't remember what it was to be beautiful and desirable and you're going to be so desirable that Jesus is coming back for you amen and so she is that little faith woman yes she's been a doubter but and it looks like God would have given up on her a long time ago but he can't because she is a part of Christ and what he had in his mind of her before the foundation of the world and she's going to be everything God said she would be and I want just to read what the prophet said and share what he could see with prophetic eyes and and these are a paraphrase of his word but this is taken from God of this evil age and he says a bride to church the word a people called out from here there for his name's sake will Unite with the body of Christ and the kingdom of the Antichrist will be taken and destroyed and Christ shall take the throne and set upon the throne of his father David and Reign upon the Earth for a thousand years and then present the church to God without spotter blemish sometimes I wonder how in the world is he going to do it with as many blemishes and spots and troubles and you know misunderstandings and doubtings and confusions and Men rising up with their own ideas and everything else and yet God said I'm going to do it amen that's what gives me a lot of Courage this morning for myself and for you too amen and he says I'll picture the bride of Christ now now the humble little bride of Christ is simply believes the word whoever she is the bride is made up of individuals and I hope and trust there's many sitting present missing he listening in and I hope that myself and every one of you all are part of that bride and and all that's been ordained to that will be that because it's their nature they see they recognize the word can only recognize the word now as he describes her he says her beautiful long or long hair Nazarite vowel shows his vow to God her beautiful gown of his promised word for the age that she's living in wrapped around her vindicating her with himself of Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and as she is part of the word groom true to him in every point the bride of Christ has vowed to Christ and he is the word a woman should not even wink at another man she should make no signs no emotions at all toward him for he is she is absolutely a bride to one bridegroom you listen to only one voice my sheep know my voice a stranger they will not follow and what is the voice any man's voice is his word and this is it the Bible not one word to be added to it or taken from it just stay right with that voice a stranger they will not follow a denomination as a she is a part of the groom true to him and every Point waiting for the wedding uniting in the sky at the wedding supper she's been given and revealed to her the seven seal Mysteries of the Bible and she sees the Folly of the deceiver so very close to the truth that almost deceived the elected see the real true Christian has Revelation or faith in his word she makes no claim of knowledge and they say well I've been got a doctor's degree makes no claim I believe his word doesn't claim to be educated doesn't belong to any denomination or any party or any sect she belongs to Christ she's his wife not the wife of a denomination but in obedience and this is what I want you to hear that little faith woman that lives by faith the bride believes the word she is obedience and waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed she's watching for it she's a part of that word and she's watching for her life to manifest that word amen can you imagine here God speaking of you is brother Branham envisioned the bride that little faith woman now you may not feel like a little faith woman or a Little Faith Church is you know or whatever but we are the Bride of Jesus Christ and we and we have been called a little faith woman and the body said which is the word is waiting for the life which is the spirit to confirm it or make it alive that's what she's waiting for there's no other life for working her she came to come to life any other way yet she feels it out there and she knows it's going to happen then here it happens and then she wakes up and God says Let There Be and she come forth like the first one come forth so you see God is still creating the bride in His image and the word of the Angel put Sarah in position of a princess a stately dignified Lady of high rank but for too long she can only see herself as a failure as having gone too far too far gone or too old or unable undesirable why she couldn't even be desired even if as a wife to a hundred-year-old man you know she just wasn't desirable anymore and certainly two unable to fulfill the prophecy you see you see in her mind she was too weak she was too faithless to to even believe Hope was gone Not only was her body dead her faith was dead how do I know her faith was dead because faith without works is dead and she had no Works she had no belief you know she saw herself as one thing but God saw her as another that's what I want you to see about yourself today you may see yourself as one thing but I want you to understand the way God sees you you may see yourself as weak and unable and I don't have the ability to be an overcomer but God says you are Mighty in faith you're that little faith woman you're a people of a Rapture you are people of an end time word that has been manifested in the flesh today you see she would see herself as one thing but God was seeing her as another oh if today we can just see ourselves if as God sees us amen God didn't see a woman too old he didn't see a woman too feeble he didn't see a woman too unable he didn't see her too weak or too much doubt too much unbelief even though when he heard her unbelief and his Senator unbelief and called it out he said but that's not who you are you are not a doubter amen you are a Believer and the visitation of the angel came to turn her heart to believing again that's what this message has come to do amen it comes to Eternal hearts to believe in and the word calls us things that we don't even recognize about ourselves that we that couldn't possibly be me and the word says we are but now that couldn't possibly be me and there in a heart we just Ponder him Wonder scoff question maybe we don't even say it out loud but we have difficulty like Gideon back there hiding hiding there you know is uh and threshing a crop and and hiding away from fear of being seen and being stolen what he had and and robbed by the midianites and and and here hiding away and he he gets a visitation from an angel that says the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor amen I imagine Gideon looked around to see who he was talking about because this couldn't surely be me he didn't feel like a mighty man of Valor he was over here scared and hiding and their threshing is weak but he was a mighty man of ours you see God was calling out the potential that was in him and that's the thing that I want you to know the message maybe you don't lie enough to it maybe you don't mess her up but God isn't talking about what you are now God is calling out the potential that it lays within that predestinated seed things that you can't even see things that you don't even recognize about yourself and yet the word of God said this is what you are brother Branham could not recognize himself as one who could speak to a mountain who could create a squirrel with words but God is true with showing him the potential that lays in the power of His word in spite of your unbelief listen God's going to have a Rapture he's going to have a bride in spite of yourself amen where is Sarah thy wife where's your wife where's the princess that's what he called her princess Sarah says I don't feel like no princess she laughs within herself too long you know she was identified as that barren woman that fruitless woman that woman it was never to be achiever the other that one that could only do it in a surrogate way the one who was always of failure and she laughs within her heart you know and within herself or within her heart but I want you to understand Sarah this 2000 year old bride you see your heart needed to be turned this is why he said in Malachi 4 5 behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great and the Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn what the heart amen that that inside part where you're scorning within yourself where you're laughing within yourself where you're questioning within yourself where you you know things you wouldn't even speak out loud but you're wondering you're questioning possibly could I do it would I can I ever measure up can I ever be a part can I really ever but he comes to turn your heart what to the fathers of the fathers to the children the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse I want you to turn with me to Isaiah 55 and verse 7 and let's learn something about our own self let's learn something about our thoughts and God's thoughts our our ideas and yet how Eternal God's word is you see the heart has to be turned back to the original faith that was once delivered to the Saints but it's not just the word is the theology but it's the word in power Isaiah 55 and 7 says let the wicked forsake his way you know to be a Christian you've got to forsake your way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and to become a Christian you got to quit thinking your old thoughts you got to have what's called in the Bible a renewing of your mind a change of your mindset and so he said and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God and he will abundantly pardon you see the moment you forsake your way the moment you forsake your thoughts and you turn to the Lord that's when he will have mercy upon you and he and he will abundantly pardon the unbelief that you have held in your heart hallelujah amen when does that come when you start forsaking your way when they forget when it becomes where you forsake your own thoughts I'm unable God could never use me who am I Lord I'm too little I'm too insignificant I really ain't that important listen God says my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts are are higher than your thoughts so God says my thoughts is Way Beyond this is why he said that he is able to do exceedingly abundantly above that which you are able to seek or ask you can't ask of God something big enough something hard enough something difficult enough come on this God there's nothing too hard for him amen and your problem isn't too insignificant brother Branham said God would raise up under the third pull a little insignificant minnow fish little nothing and show he has resurrection and life that God cares about little things I want you to know God cares about your little things Force the rain coming down in the snow from the heaven and returning not thither but water at the Earth and make it that come down and Bud bring forth and Bud that it may bring give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whether I sweathered to I sin it for you shall go out with joy and shall be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the fields have clapped the hands Sarah you're going to laugh again Sarah you're coming to the springtime you talk about changing of the season this is restoration hour Hallelujah were leaves will break out into singing amen the hills separate before and singing and they shall clap their hands and there's going to be a it's a time of rejoice in the Bible calls at the time of refreshing from the presence of the Lord instead of thorns it shall come up a fir tree something usable instead of a briar another Thorn it shall be come up for a myrtle tree and it shall beads of the Lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off so the word will not return to God empty it shall accomplish what he sent it to do I want to reassure you today in the moments of great calamity in the moment where the world is nervous in the moment where governments and economies are about to fall and collapse in the moments when we're being lied to on every hand and and and the rising of evil like you've never seen I want you to know the word God sent in this day will not return to him empty it's going to accomplish getting a bride for his namesake amen amen now don't look like he has much to work with a 2 000 year old woman with color with accumulated unbelief hey man it don't look like he has much to work with but God showed you what he he can do little as much he can he's the God who can take Five Loaves and two fishes and feed five thousand he's a God that can take and take things that you think's impossible and turn them around making your impossibly impossibilities possibilities Hallelujah praise the Lord you'll never get too old you never get two people it's not just for young people it's for the it's for the old age the decrepit the feeble the weary the beat down the broken down the broken situation the broken home the broken marriage the broken relationships I don't care how broken Hallelujah he's the resurrection and the life [Applause] first Thessalonians 2 and 13 says for this cause we thank god without cease and because when you receive the word of God which you've heard of us you received it not as the word of man but as in truth the word of God you see when you take your Bible that's why you got to take it you got to take it not as a word of man Even though men wrote it moved on by the Holy Ghost you've got to take it as it is the truth the word of God which effectually works in you when you believe come on now amen look another translation said when you have faith the word of God is a living power in you let me say it again when you have faith the word of God is a living power in you amen the word became a living power within Sarah arresting her thoughts changing her attitude amen enlarging her faith and finally changing her body come on Church you know that she was 90. she couldn't help that baby God had to change the body he had to bring her back to where she was can I say it this way the bright she wasn't Pentecost he had to read now her again he had to restore her and he had to fix the problem that caused her to stray to begin with to be barren when the angel came Sarah was faithless hopeless bitter angry old set in her ways but he turned her heart and she began to see herself as God saw her God said I don't see this old woman I see a young woman I don't see I don't see somebody that's feeble and and got a problem and hunts back and old and I Tremor in her voice I see a young woman I see one capable of bringing forth a child of chasing a baby of washing diapers amen of getting up during the night and tending to a little one yeah come on I see her I see her something different than it is and and he had to turn her heart where she could begin to see herself as God saw her she was a princess that's what God called her he made her name princess chosen come on elect desirable no longer a forsaken woman but a sought after woman not even just by her husband even but a young king would look upon her and she was so beautiful a beauty that had to come first on the inside trying to get something to you it had to first turn her heart and her heart become beautiful and her thoughts and become beautiful and then our words become beautiful Hallelujah and then her whole body began to become beautiful I'm trying to tell you something friends when your heart gets turned and began then to speak from the heart from the from the heart the mouth begins to speak amen and you begin to speak amen I am what he says I am I can do all things to Christ I am more than an overcomer I am I'm not a defeated person I am a conqueror I am an overcomer amen but it has to come first on the inside you see Sarah had a change in her heart first before the change of her body she started believing she was a princess amen not one by a substitution through a child of Hagar but that she was indeed absolutely indeed the Queen Mother of the abrahamic race brother when she began to think different she started walking with her shoulders back amen her head held up high and and God had called her a princess well if God calls me a princess I'm gonna act like a princess if God calls me bride I'm going to act like bride if God says I'm his son or his daughter I'm going to act like a son or daughter I'm going to behave like he called me amen God had called her a princess and that nagging feeling of I'll never be good enough I'm too weak my faith isn't that strong I'll never have enough I can never please God enough it's too much God expects too much of me you know it's that spirit of fear that that wants to sneak up on you and overwhelm you and keep you trying to pry its Wicked fingers off of your neck you know it's that spirit of fear that wants to choke you down and hold you back God wants you to know you're loved you're cared about he says in Isaiah 43 and 4 you are precious in my eyes and you are honored and I love you isn't that wonderful you are precious in my eyes you are honored and I love you God wants you to know I love you amen God the psalm says God is within her and she shall not fall Jesus said in John 15 9 he said the father as a father has loved me so have I loved you abide in my love this is what God wants for you to know that you're loved that he cares about you as he would say cast all your cares on me because I care for you but in spite of that you feel doubtful how can he love me I've never done anything worthy of being loved but this is what the god the Bible says says you are worthy in fact the matter is he says you're somebody I'll fight for he said the Lord will fight for you and you only need to be still amen you don't have to do a thing but just trust in me amen that's all you have to do just stay be still amen and trust in me and I'm going to fight for you can you imagine God fighting on your behalf that you're worse you're worth fighting over come on now if Michael would fight over the dead body of Moses amen that don't you know God's gonna fight over the body of his bride Hallelujah don't you know he's fighting for you this morning as God says you're worth fighting for he says are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins and not one of them is forgotten before God he said I want you to know they out there said there's two of them that are that are sold for just you know five sparrows sold for two copper coins they're almost worthless but he says none of them are forgotten by God amen I'm the god of the insignificant I'm the god of even those that people don't think anything of and he said but he said about you now now wait a minute you you're very hairs of your head are numbered that's how close I know you that's how intimate I am with you amen that I that the very hairs of your head are numbered so don't fear no more he said you're more value than sparrows they're so insignificant man will sell them for nothing for pennies but for you oh my amount you're you're not insignificant you are worthy you are mine you are sought after you are cared about you are loved you are wanted you are desirable you are needed [Music] Hallelujah it's the God who goes before you it's the Lord who goes before you he will be with you he will never leave you or forsake you do not fear or be dismayed listen to these words that's Deuteronomy 31 and 8 but nevertheless these words are saying you you know you know that you are valuable that you're admirable that you're precious that you're worthwhile it's so hard sometimes to see ourselves in that light are you are you just you're so afraid that you just don't measure up somehow dude you know you have difficulty understanding how could I be valuable in God's eyes you see with Sarah there had to be something else rural or hard oh sitting in this tent if you hear Brother Branham talk about it um I think it's in the messages anything too hard for the Lord he tells about the mood that Sarah was in yeah you know and and the house he was thinking you know how left out she was and how Lot's wife got this and how'd this happen you know looking out at others and she was feeling this feelings of of uh being overlooked being uncared for God that just passed over her yeah Abraham had this son and and you know he had to Hagar as a as a surrogate mother and yet you know you know in years to come Sarah's not going to be the mother of the race Hagar is right now we're just given lift service Sarah's mother she's the wife she's the woman but Hagar is the real mother and all of this unbelief was ruling her heart but you see they had to come and turn into the heart where the peace of God began to rule her heart no longer did negative thoughts rule her heart as brother Brandon said you can never get anything from God with a negative thought he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him keep thinking that if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things you see the the word of the son of man God includes of a man God and human does his word began to rule her heart this is what we got to do as message Believers start letting the word rule our hearts not what's set on CNN or Fox News or in your bank account or what in the economy or the inflation all of that rule in your heart but let the peace of God rule your heart into which you're called in one body and be thankful as he sounds in Colossians 3 16 let the word of God dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your heart let you know the verse before it said let the peace of God rule then we'll let the word dwell in you richly how in the world is the peace of God going to rule when your mind is full of all the negativity that's in the world amen the negativity that maybe somebody said about you or belittled you or maybe from your childhood of feeling neglected maybe a father who is not a uh who is not a father in the home and never could show love and or maybe a mother who abandoned you I don't know what situation you may have come from come on you may have been unwanted as a child undesirable reject it don't let those thoughts rule your mind and heart let the peace of God rule your heart let the word of God dwell in you richly in all wisdom and teaching and admonishing and Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and singing sound like whatever thoughts you're getting out of the words causing you to rejoice come on now amen causing you to sing amen now you go to the doctor's report said this but if we get back on the word you can sing in the very face of a bad report are you with me church amen the word is to dwell in you richly Hallelujah Isaiah said 26 and verse 3 thou will keep him in perfect peace here's how to have your peace whose mind has stayed on thee because he trusts Us in thee amen don't let your mind Wonder Don't Let It race don't let it go out to the wrong kind of thinking arrest those thoughts brother Brandon said it's birds that are flying over him and they want to come there in your mind and and and you know and and but he said you can't help that but he said don't let them Roost take you a double barrel shotgun of Old and New Testament and loaded amen notice he said he said thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind has stayed on thee because he trusts Us in the trust in the Lord forever for the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength Hallelujah put your trust in him amen some men will trust in horses the Old Testament said that was their power then some will trust in their armies but our trust is in the name of the Lord God of Israel you see of course the spirit of God is the word and that one and the same we are we are a word bride amen and that's and what's coming forth in this hour is in the church is a word bride it's in the sermon of birth pains brother Brandon said she's fixing to bring forth the perfect word and the groom the word is coming for the word Bride As a woman is part of a man so the church will have to be a word abiding church every word of the Bible a word abiding Church letting the word dwell in you richly amen so every word that is spoke of the Virgin must be fulfilled in this bride she is the absolute embodiment of all the scriptures and all the types that spoke of a bride amen so you know it doesn't matter whether it's Sarah or Rebecca or Esther or who she is embodiments of all that ever spoke of the Bride you know it's a the Malachi 4 says our hearts are to be turned to that Churn it when I when I take my mind off of my enemies and my oppression and my mind turns to the word of God to thy statutes you know it becomes a heart that is fixed or heart that is established amen not an unsettled heart not a questioning heart not a doubting heart but a settled heart Psalms 57 7 my heart is fixed so God my heart is fixed I will sing and give praise in other words I'm keeping my heart on You O God therefore I will sing

doctor's report take the scripture with you he shall not be afraid of evil Tidings his heart is fixed trusting in the Lord amen his heart is established he shall not be afraid until he sees his desire upon his enemies amen isn't that wonderful the Bible is saying you're going to see your desire upon your enemy what's going to happen to cancer what's going to happen to trouble come on what's going to happen to the devil you're going to see your desire upon your enemy amen your heart is fixed now brother Branham tells us in the pergamian church age he gives us a few Keys here and he says Jesus knew that there was going to be a terrible Drift from the word in the pergamian age as it was 200 years off of the past from the Patmos Vision he knew the drift would cause him to go in the Dark Ages he knew that the way that man originally got away from God was my first leaving the word now here here's the source of any problem you'll have leaving the word come on leaving the word if you leave that word you've left God so it's backsliding thus he is presenting himself to the church at Perkins indeed to all the churches of all ages that's us I am the word what's now if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word hello don't let anything or anyone get between you and that word this is which I'm giving you the word is a revelation of myself I am the word remember that well brother Tim glory to God we have received the message and man we have welcomed the word the seals and Mysteries the Rebellion Revelation and how to dress and and God sent a prophet Hallelujah well what about his word about healing amen what about his word about healing I'm asking the Bible said in Deuteronomy 7 15 and the Lord will take away from you all sickness and will afflict you with none of the terrible diseases of Egypt which you have known so you see he's going to take away all sickness are you with me now amen if you're sick welcome that word amen welcome that word if you because what that brings deity in on the scene when you welcome and receive the word the Lord will take away all your sickness and will afflict you with none of the terrible diseases of Egypt which you've known now let me just say this no sickness is from God the Bible said he takes away sickness not that he brings sickness he promised that he would not afflict us with any of the terrible diseases of Egypt all sicknesses of the devil God did not bring it but he will take it away amen it's a foreign life it's a demonic life amen but we have the right to cast it out but the only way you'll ever cast it out is you've got to First believe the word oh brother Timmy brother Joe we just lay handsome and give me a private work it's not that's a secondary a prophet Vision or a prophet word even if Brother Brad and brother Brandon said the Visions I don't have them the thing is a secondary way of God speaking even in preaching like I'm preaching this morning is a secondary way of God speaking but he said God's first way of speaking is his Bible the word of God this is as fast and it can't go different I don't care what a prophet said or anybody else said if an angel comes from Heaven says any other thing he's accursed yes if you want God to come on to sing welcome the word receive it quit thinking well I'm sick God what did I do this time how did I fail you what did I do why are we always blaming our relationship with God like he's just watching now for you to slip up somewhere so he can get you all his eyes on us brother Tim he's looking out he's trying to find an excuse to punish us send us to help balance this forever why are we blaming our relationship with God every time that something has I I'm sick though I must have failed God you're sick I'm going to tell you why you're sick because you're human and your body was perverted from perfection when God originally made man he couldn't get sick God didn't listen to all sicknesses of the devil amen and because your body was perverted from Perfection it's now open to the tormenting Spirit of the devil so Satan's Army brings diseases that's what he is he's a destroyer Satan the kingdom of Satan is sickness death sorrow frustration worry all on Satan God is life Faith peace Joy amen and those are the two forces coming together right now and they're battling right now not just in this building but right in your mind amen because that's where the greatest battle has ever fought amen and the only way that you're going to win the Battle Is by changing your mind to start believing what God's word said [Applause] amen or Heather either you're given weapons to the devil to destroy you they battle right here day by day every day Satan his brother Branham said following you along that great big kingly Priestly Goliath trying to scare the liver out of you well I'll tell you what don't look on the internet to see about your problem you'll get your liver and your gizzard and everything else cared out of you amen look in the Bible to see about your situation [Music] amen you you know be fortified with the gospel with the word of truths around your loin amen a Hellman of Salvation a shield of Faith a sword weaving in your hand and say Satan I'm coming to meet you in the name of Jesus Christ so brother Brandon says I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst I wonder God's trying to show us the power in it for he even brings the word he shows us the power it healed the blind the deaf the dumb cripples walk those as hideously in in crippled shape you know turned and made human again it did buns crack everything else spines that were Twisted come together God's showing us for even brings the message he's first showing us the power of it then before the third pull in the opening of The Seven Seals which is the revealing of the word which was the third phase he shows you the power of it amen what will it do it'll create it'll resurrects it'll save it'll heal it'll change atmospheres Hallelujah amen it'll qualm the storms in your life now brother Branham tells us to fulfill his word he must keep his word I've often wondered when they would see his word manifested what would they do about it and say oh well some says it's to telepathy others said it's a wild imagination pretty good imagination they called out names and afflictions and troubles and what the doctor said that's pretty good imagination amen telepathy that's pretty good mind reading examine it by the word God's word promised it all heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall never fail open that door of faith when Jesus was on the earth he knew that that scripture pertained to him would said if you destroy this body I'll raise it up again in three days the prophet said I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell he knew that scripture pertained to him and he was for he was the Messiah and he knew it his unfailing faith put him in position to know that he was the perfect born son of God if your faith will put you in position to know that every Divine promise of God's Bible is for you just just as sure as it pertained to him every promise pertains to you oh this ought to change your attitude about the written word amen you're healing your salvation your freedom from sin your selfishness and your your indifference your little turtle shell you want to pull yourself into Christ come in to be Lord and ruler to set you free from those things but we won't do it and he said the reason why is because people are fulfilling the scripture of being lukewarm cold and formal I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst we received a message from an angel do we believe what it said let me give you a thought here he says how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer yet in first John 5 14 we're told this is a confidence we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us you know the first thing you got to do is decide whether it's God's will or not well I don't know if it's God's will to heal me well then you better figure it out the Bible said it is God showed his will in Jesus he healed the sick everywhere he went he was he was the Divine will of God made manifest his attitude toward the sick is the same today as it was then because he's the same yesterday today and forever somebody help me preach so the first thing you got to do is that God's will to heal me yes it's God's will to heal me he said it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and again in this word so this is a confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he Hearth his we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions we desire to him so now we ask what is the will of God there's only one way to know his will and that's by the word of God so what's the word of God about healing what's the word about he gifts what's the word about miracles what is the word of God about your your needs what is the word of God about you are you just happen sense did you just accidentally come are you just a second thought you were in his thinking before the foundation of the world you're chosen you've been called you've been placed in this age not to be a failure come on Sarah you viewed yourself as a failure way too long quit looking at yourself as I can't and begin to realize God placed me here because he knew I could lamentation 3 37 who is he that saith and he come to pass when the Lord commanded not therefore there it is if it isn't in the words you can't have it we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it's in his name there it is again Jesus the name is the word the will you can't separate God in his word they are one so I can have healing because it's in the word I can have peace because it's in the word amen John 14 27 peace I leave with you my peace I've given to you not as the world giveth I give I to you let not your heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid now here's what God is saying now listen if you are capable of becoming this he could never say it but the very fact that he said it makes you capable of coming this Amen Let not your heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid so then he brings it right down to the word he left behind on pretty page so here you go take your Bible open it up here's the word of God he's left behind on printed page it is a part of him when you accept it by faith into a Spirit-filled life he said his word was life that's exactly what he is he says I'm the way the truth and the life he says in Romans If any man have multiple Spirit of Christ he's none of his therefore he is Spirit he is life that's exactly what the word is that's exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born I mean Spirit born spear-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips while that is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man Hallelujah taken the word of printed Pages believing it in the heart placing upon your lips every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before it is written it is written it is written it is written if the church way back in the third age it only held on to the Revelation see that's what the devil's trying to do to us get us to let go of the revelation of the Living Word in our midst Living Word not dead word not a Creed not just a message with no life in it a word with power the power of God would have never faded as it did in those dark cases and right today how many is ready for this right today when the church returns to the word in faith we can say without a doubt that the glory of God and the Wonder sacks of God will be in her midst again Hallelujah let me announce it loud and clear when she returns in faith that little faith woman this one that one here there that bride this one here there whoever you are individuals when you return in faith Hallelujah the glory of God in this wonderful acts of God will be in amidst again she will because she is that little fake woman [Applause] and she must understand and know her position as Princess David knew his position he had been anointed I wish I was you have amen come on Church a prophet anointed you as much as come on you know that as much as anointed David you've been anointed by message in this last day the laodice in his last day to sit with him on his throne so anything between here and the Rapture to get you away any Goliath any devil his head's coming off if he dares to challenge the Servants of the Living God if he dares to resist that name if he steps out in boldness walking out to try to defeat this bride his head will come off not us to feed it we have been anointed to sit on the throne David knew his position every morning every morning every person should get up and pick up five stones you know I can I can walk right out here not find the stone but I know some places I can find a stone so I go to that place because I'm not going to just find the right Stone anywhere but I'm going to find the right Stone amen you're not going to get it on CNN but then I got to have my news all you get is more unbelief doubt confusion lies lies lies I don't care if it comes from Fox lies he's a slow Fox liar but we got to get our daily dose what's happening in the world what's happening in the word what's happening in the bride what's God going to do for me today where am I going to see you move where am I going to use the Holy Ghost to defeat an enemy I've got to get prepared amen I'm going to go right down to the brook of his promise Hallelujah pick up me five stones amen five promises of God you know what I want to do with that I'm going to put it in my sling of prayer hallelujah hallelujah I'm going to put it in my sling of prayer and I'm going to sling that with a hand of faith oh Hallelujah don't be afraid to let it go it'll hit the target don't be afraid it'll heal the sick here to bring your lost one you know come on here to save the Lost you're gonna deliver the people of God Don't Be Afraid Let It Go Hallelujah Hallelujah David was a dancing before he ever met Goliath he was dancing out to battle he had a song in his heart he had to replace it I am who he said I am I am I am the king where is that Goliath where is that country eating you up where is those cataracts where is that crippled are where is that problem where is that devil the devil said well you might as well settle down and quit believing the doctor said this and that listen the Christ that made you stop drinking that's made you stop smoking and lying and stealing that saved your life from a life of drunkenness from sin and from a devil's grave if that God could do that for you Hallelujah he will save you from your cancer your TP your old age Problem whatever it is I have been laughed after saying it but I'm gonna say it again you do not have to die sick [Applause] you can die healthy and well and change dimensions Hallelujah amen I'll tell you what church don't you give up on me don't you just discount me don't you say well he's just too old and and yeah just a little bit too feeble you know to carry the load no I ain't [Applause] in the world Hallelujah I'm here to the end Hallelujah but you've got to position yourself in the Word of Promise the promise of the word so the restoration promise is a a promise of a word of returning to the word in faith and then no doubt without a doubt the glory and wonderful acts of God will be in her head so the word is not simply theology we have turned this message into theology into Creeds dogmas anytime you hear Brother Branham called Creeds and dogmas that's what men have turned the message into you know it's just a statement of faith this is what we believe but there's no power to it and by the way God hates a powerless religion and God the only thing that will please him is when people believe him amen I know this bride is going to please him amen listen listen Jesus Jesus did more than just teaching you see to teach only is is just denominationalism we just turned this into lectures you know and and God you know don't have no power in it so we got to incorporate from the denominations there's psychology to fix our problems and you know but I want you to remember I always keep this in mind that the difference between two doctrines true Doctrine and Pharisee Doctrine is a true doctrine of Jesus is not in word only but it is that the word in action or the word in power you see Matthew 7 29 said the people were astonished at his Doctrine because he taught it whereas one have an authority you see there was an authority when he preached the word there again when in Mark 1 27 they were all amazed in so much the question among themselves saying what thing is this what new doctrine is this for with authority commandeth he even the evil unclean spirits and they do obey him true Doctrine gives power over unclean spirits that's why I know men are not preaching true Doctrine when they have to go to psychology to find Deliverance for their people I know they're not preaching the truths oh well they're quoting the quotes the devil does too but it's a word without power it's a word without life now so you see true Doctrine gives you authority over the devil I'll say well brother Tim we've got great revelation we we actually know more than anybody else watch you we leave the denominations and the dust praise God you know but it's the revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil so true Revelation gives you authority over the devil and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil oh he said if you can only believe what God has given and if you're seated there you will use it for your ordained to do what you are to do now Jesus of course would read himself right into the scripture hello I'm trying to get you to crack your Bible open dust it off Jesus read himself right into the scripture he relied upon knowing he was the word you see he had faith in God who made him the word this bridey is a word bride she has faith in God who said you are the word amen you are the word of restoration you are the word of power you're the Word of Deliverance amen and you see they that gave him Faith because he understood his position you see princes has a position pride has a position come on you have a position because of the relationship son or daughter has a position amen so he knew what he said he knew who he was because the scripture said he was at and and hear every scripture tied in see it wasn't just one scripture but all the scripture tying in over and over and again and he knew exactly what the scripture said that it would be in fact the matter is he said search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life but they are testifying of me amen listen there again this is what you must do yourself the bride must be able to say the same thing search the scripture for they testify of who I am amen God said he would have a bride in this day and if he then then of course he said if he did that with that he relied upon what God made him if he did that that can't we rely on what God made us as Believers these signs shall follow them that believe he had faith in what he was and if you're a Believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer have faith in yourself as a believer not a doubter not weak Come on talk in the devil's language I'm weak I don't have very much faith my faith isn't very strong don't let your heart condemn you let your heart be turned you see you're letting your heart be condemned let not your heart be troubled believe D look what he's saying of course if you're doing things wrong repent Amen Let Him remove Sims as far as the East is from the West because otherwise you can't have confidence that he hears you amen so you if there's something you did wrong well repent well I search and assertion of search and I quit I couldn't find that quit searching then and it's except forgiveness but when your heart couldn't can't don't condemn you and you know you're a Believer there's nothing between you and God you can ask what you will and know it'll be given because this the word that's been has given to you just like it was those disciples because it's the words it's given to you just like it was to those disciples could you could you accept that that this Bible this word is given to me just like it was to Peter James and John just like it was to Rahab or Elizabeth or whoever in the Bible come on the word is given to you just like it was to those now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are amen because whatever the word said about me that's what I am though I don't see it yet that's what I am and Jesus had faith in the word that said what he was is written of me and he said didn't David in the Psalms and the prophet and all them speak of him said I'm the bread of life that come down from God out of Heaven I am the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden I am all of these things I am that I am now so you see a Believer he said is the faith of God that moves in you so because you are a Believer the faith of God is moving in you it's an action first Peter 3 and 12 sister Genie sent me this this week and it blessed my heart for the eyes of the Lord are all are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers that ought to make everyone of you shout the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers God listens when you talk even Sarah when you just kind of set it in your heart and it was scoring it God listen it hurt amen but when you say things that pleases him when you're agreeing with the word come on now amen his ears are open oh you got my attention you saying what I said amen you're in agreement with me your heart is in turn hey man it's been turned and it's in tune amen listen we're not to turn this message into a powerless religion you see it's the word of God and the word of God is quick or Alive the word of God is living and Powerful it is sharper than any two-edged sword the Bible said in second Timothy 3 16 and just let me quote it like this for all scripture is breathed out by God foreign how did I speak I breathed out words amen come on the word scripture had to come from God first and he breathed it out and spoke it and is profitable for teaching if I reproof for correction for training and righteousness that the man of God may be complete and equipped forever good work so again God gave you breathe God breathed words that have power in them Amen to equip you forever good work amen it's a living power and it's interject energy energetic and active listen brother Branham talked about it he said I read the Bible and here's his attitude toward it he said I read the Bible and I get up and run around the chair and scream to the top of my voice and cried a little bit and sat down and read a little more and get up and run around again don't sound like to me he's listening to the news don't sound like me he was listening to CNN he said I read the Bible and I get up and run around the chair scream to the top of my voice cry a little bit sit down read a little more and get up and run again around again he's I guess it's a mate or somebody come by they would think they had a maniac shut up in that room but you know I feel I I like it no matter what I what I act like here I feel good I'm going to another land and I like to hear about it and you can see a vision I mean you're like see a vision oh my wouldn't that be great brother Joe to see a vision man man I mean a a real Vision like I see a vision I mean a real one not imagination a real Vision but Joe wouldn't you like that oh you love to have a vision and you can see a vision anytime you look into the Bible [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah you can see a vision of any time you can a if you're sick you can see a vision of a perfectly healed person and step by step walk into that Hallelujah don't limit the Bible to be in just a book of History a book of moral code it's a vision it's a prophecy when he speaks he's speaking about me read division what did it save you search the scripture Jesus look at the grave said I'll be in there three days because he said he'll not leave my soul in hell neither will I allow my Holy One to seek corruption right amen you can look in the scripture and say by his stripes I'm Healed by the doctor but the doctors report but whose report you believe I can look in the scripture and say I'm raptured and I'm not left here for the tribulation I'm not going to make it I've already made it amen it's written Satan Jesus told Satan it is written and that mentally by every word and then of course Satan comes around tries to get him to doubt his experience isn't that the way it is you know no matter how great an experience you can have you can be baptized by a prophet a forerunner wrote of in the scripture and here he's standing there and and he sees the dove come down and the boy in heaven opened and a voice speak out this is my beloved Son this is the son I love I'm coming to dwell in him Hallelujah and he baptized he's baptized in John's as he's going to ask Behold the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world well brother that's a pretty good experience ain't it amen wouldn't you like to have that experience at your baptism amen Jesus Sarah had that experience walks out with that great experience and doubts it you say he doubted it words are coming to him now you see he doesn't it's it defines that other person that is there that's not him but if you were just there you wouldn't see the devil and here he's having thoughts if you are really what haven't said you were then prove it you're hungry make these stones into bread come on what was it Satan was right there do you know the Bible said God led him into the wilderness other scriptures said you know it's found in Matthew 4 4 and Luke 4 4. so then so here here again what what do you find in the scripture there is saying that Jesus one of them says he was led of the spirit the other said he was driven of the spirit he was led and he was driven to go faith and adversary not a record devil but Satan himself nothing some little devil that might be assigned to you but the Devil Himself comes along and said now if you're the Son of God play trying to get him to doubt his experience you see that's the devil's job know who that is I'm doubting my experience no you're not the devil is putting doubts in your mind of your experience recognize who's speaking it ain't God never takes away what he gives you he's not an Indian giver somebody help me preach amen if God gave you the Holy Ghost I wish I had that experience listen every time listen to me real close every time that a person is born again the same thing happens Heaven opens the devil ascended and it's God saying when he gives you the Holy Ghost is God saying this is the son I love and I'm pleased to dwell in you otherwise he ain't coming to dwell but every person is ever born again has had that Jesus experience on the River Jordan come on amen what was it the heavens open the dove descended come on the voice says what is his voices the voices of his word this is my beloved Son and I'm happy I'm pleased to come live in him I'm giving him the Holy Ghost if you got the Holy Ghost that's what he said about you now that God said I love you the devil says he don't who are you going to believe [Applause] so you see faith you know sometimes when we look at the Bible we look at it as a book oh it's just hard to understand but God's word becomes very simple when we regard every word is true and then we act accordingly it's staggered truths of power and authority granted to the church then becomes a living reality faith is simply believing that God will do what he said he would do I said well I don't have much Faith well wait a minute what is Faith it's believing that God is able come on God didn't say to Sarah Sarah now you know you're 90 years old and you know you're strong enough you can do this girl and you can change and you can become Young and you can marry this child and you you can do this you got this God didn't say this God said I got this he didn't say is this too hard for you Sarah he knew it was too hard for Sarah God knows it's too hard for you it's too hard for you to live a Christian Life it's too hard for you to make a Rapture it's too hard for it come on it's too hard for you you can't heal yourself you can't save yourself but there's nothing too hard for the Lord change your mind your focus of who we're talking about [Applause] faith is believed in God will do what he said in his word he will do and Sarah receives strength when she judged him faithful she believed what God would say would do what he said she still didn't know how it still seemed unreasonable the circumstances were still there her hands still wrinkled her stoop seal in her shoulder but her heart began to believe and and this is what Abraham did Abraham simply believed that God would do what he said he would do and and God imputed it for righteousness and and the Book of Romans would say that David you know described the blessedness of a man whom God imputes righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered you see he would not impute sin to sell no matter how much I believe she had he would not impute sin to her instead he imputed Grace to her you know listen you're going to receive the promise the son of promise Jesus is coming back for you in this evil day in spite of the fact that you've laughed in your heart and said it's not possible for the whole unbelieving church like me to be one that Jesus brings that brings Jesus back to the Earth you see don't don't say I'm unworthy I'm not righteous enough I haven't done anything to deserve it but be happy that your iniquities are forgiven and your sins are covered be happy and rejoice because the Lord will not impute sin to you amen not not that you're not like brother Branham bumbling and frustrated and questioning and wondering and what and God God sets all of that aside and uses a man's voice to speak a word of creation what's now he said of you you are without spot or blemish or any such thing amen you are my sinless bride you're perfect in my eyes you've got to start viewing yourself as God views you you know years ago brother biscos told a story of a Tin Cow bride is actually wasn't his if he heard it from somewhere else it's actually all over the Internet you can go and research it and whatever but that was this young girl that was rather homely maybe not the most desirable one and she she kind of you know felt that way about herself and was shy and you know backward and and and didn't real felt real insignificant and nobody and and so the story goes on that there was a man that saw her and loved her and he said you know you know they he he usually for a bride that Dowry would be maybe one or two cows depending on her value you know maybe someone that was maybe not that pretty not that wanted and wasn't didn't feel that valuable they didn't feel was maybe others didn't think she was that valuable that he just gives one one cow or two cows he's more she's real pretty and you know really nice and ever form and desirable and got lots of suitors or the price goes up you know yeah you know brother Joe you got high prices for your girls yeah amen and so he you know maybe maybe for that one you get five but this

Zephaniah 3 you can write that down for a reference but I'm just going to kind of quote it to you as we go along here's God talking about the restoration of Israel who represented his bride at that time said sing Old Daughter of Zion Shadow Israel be glad and rejoice with all your heart o daughter of Jerusalem the Lord is taking away your judgments he has cast out your enemies the king of the of

with joy and he will rest in his love he will Joy over thee with singing did you think of that God sings God sings you sing you sing because of your joy over him but he said he's going to sing because of his Joy over you Hallelujah you you make God sing when he looks at you he sings Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 10 for we are God's workmanship his handiwork his craftsmanship his own Masterwork a work of art a masterpiece created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God prepared in advance for us to do so we are God's accomplishment hello don't talk bad about God's accomplishments don't think bad about God's handiwork don't criticize his masterpiece did he and a sloppy Workman now could you imagine God doing bad workmanship huh now if you're still breathing check and see yeah I am if you're still breathing he's not still he's not through working on you you are his craftsmanship you are his you are his Masterpiece he is handiwork his master work his work of art amen amen well but my faith is not too strong shut up and let him work he through he's fixing that and he gets when he gets through with your faith that little tiny Mustard Seed of Faith a little spot of Faith a little bitty faith that you got today but will become raptured in faith [Applause] hallelujah amen so God rejoices and he works and he sings while he's working over you I'm in a psalm hmm oh no no no that that wrinkle of bitterness ah nope you got to smooth that out and none of that fear no that's not me that has torment fear ain't a God I ain't lying nope nope shove that out of there um and he smiling as he sings working on you working on you molding you when you awake you're going to awaken His image we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is amen and he smiles as he sings Oh I wanna see her and just look up on her face there I'll sing forever of her beauty and her grace and on the streets of Glory we'll shout him we will rejoice Satan's bound My Brightest Crown together we'll lift our voice and he's working and he's working and he's moving that out no you can't think like that uh change I'm going to turn your heart got to turn that heart a little bit I'm sending a message there before you believe what I am able to do I can do exceed in abundance yeah I got this yeah I've got your problem yeah I got your marriage yeah I got your kids yeah they're going to be Mighty in the land Hallelujah your Offspring is going to be blessed I'm going to bless you going in and coming out everything I'm going to bless you in every way come on I'm taking all this out of you amen hallelujah so he works along oh I can't wait to see her happy and complete there with me forever my raptured bride should be will honeymoon together for a thousand years of Peace sins all past we'll Reign at last throughout eternity you got to quit thinking the wrong thinking oh it's not for me I can't believe it I'll never be perfect my faith is so little that's the devil's language you've been talking listen the Bible tells you the wisdom of the wise and that Satan will be brought to naught what's the symbol for naught for nothing zero he will be brought to zero oh everything he said about you is going to be brought to you all the threats he's had against she's going to be brought to nothing all your inferiority complex it comes from a devil maybe your daddy tried to put it on your mother your this or that somebody else said this it's gonna be nothing come on you need to tell the devil devil you're nothing and look down when you say it because he's under your feet Hallelujah he's going to be brought tonight and all the while God is singing about you rejoicing over you thinking oh my God did you hear what she did the other day do you hear what my brothers do did you hear the other day when when my bride got got faced with the cancer they got they cast him out did you hear that goodness what I said they would do there I mean they even have their sons in my image they're just like me they're starting to believe and actually believe the more I can bless them because I can release blessings when they believe Hallelujah the quitting is fear because fear has no value fear is not of God fear hath torment fear is of the devil I never put fear on you I did not come to bring you fear and failure I came to bring you loud and courage and ability My bride is mighty in faith convinced my power thou fulfill my promises I'm convinced I'm convinced her faith will become rapturing faith when and I'm convinced of that this morning are you convinced I'm convinced when I lay my hands on the sick they shall recover not because of the magic of the Mystic power of my hands but because he said I would do this when I command evil spirits to leave to leave they will leave not because I'm a holy man and have a perfect record but because my righteousness of him and he said to me and my name you will cast out Devils of all kinds shapes varieties porn Devils lost Devils fear Devils doubting Devils demons of sickness of all kinds when I speak they have to go this is the faith of those that are truly born again that that fact it places Faith within the The Riches of the simplest child when we conclude that the written word that anything and everything that God said in his Bible is God's revealed wheel to us amen for everything that he longs to do for us then we treasure that word we stand on it and expect God to make it good without wavering or doubting or worrying we take her position as a bride of Christ amen now so as we go into this for a moment and I'm trying to bring it down you know where that I can finish this and I'm only halfway through and so it is a bad dilemma but I want you to get it you see Satan will do everything he can to cause you to doubt Jeremiah 32 17 says oh Lord God behold thou mayest heavens and the Earth by thy great power and stretched out the arm and there is nothing too hard for thee surely if he made the heavens and the Earth then he can handle your puny little insignificant problem but of course Satan loves us some New Year tactics he wants to use smear tactics on this church and he will smear even the name of Pentecost until you don't want to be identified with it to keep you beat down so that you won't use your Faith Hill he'll make a mockery of gifts speaking in tongues until it becomes considered baby talk something only the mature that the material would never do and this of course removes from you the power the intercession of the Holy Spirit through our lips you see the devil knows that Mark 16 an action is the word in action amen and he he don't care how much word word you have as long as it never goes into action as long as your sword is just a pretty ornaments on your side he he has nothing to fear and that's why Satan hates altar calls and Holy Ghost experience that's why Satan despises prayer lines he knows when you put the word into action he's going to be cast out oh but this is a word Revival yet but it's not a dead form of or theology Revival you can't revive that it's a dead and rotten this is a word Revival of the faith what's delivered to the Saints so it's a word in action not the word for decoration you see and so we have not been called to fear but we have we have been called to trust the more I trust him the more I love him and I show my love to him by my trust now I want to get something to you we should not fear God we should reverence God we should not be afraid of him as a boy just honestly I was afraid of my daddy when he came home from work we scattered I long for his approval but I've found none he was a good man he did many great things for me but I could never measure up I could never meet his approval but you know what I did with that I broke the cycle I want my children to know they are my joy that I'm proud of them my girls their Daddy's Girls you know when I got married I I wondered what I my home be like my the home that I grew up in I had Christian parents you know I I I love my mother but I was afraid of my dad and and you know I never had relationship with him and I thought God I don't want I don't want my wife I want her to have a relationship I want her to help me loved but I I don't I don't want them to love her more I want them to love me as much as they do her I I want to be loved and I want them to know I love them that I care about them that I'm proud of them that they're my joy you know so my my daughters their Daddy's Girls I've let them known throughout the years you know and and just more than just words but in actions and deeds you're my pride you're my joy my son is my pride you see he's uh he's the apple of my eye as my girls are they don't have to guess about it they don't have to wonder I tell them that I show them that I let them know they are loved a man who can't tell his sons and daughters that they are loved is not a father he is a sperm Donovan he not you know you see like I said he's not a father let me say it again he's a sperm donor he's never been a father a father is nurturing a father tells his children I love you he's not too prideful he's not too shy he's not too backwards he's not too bit he's not too warped that he can't release love you see you see he shows them he expresses him maybe you had a father that that abandons him maybe he had a father that didn't care about you that never never could say I love you never never had you know never praised you never spoke well of you maybe you have that kind of relationship and whatever but you don't have to keep that today you can start today and break the cycle be a real man a real man can love it's not a to man a man can love a man can care a man can have compassion a man can nurture he's a father and the reason I know I can do that because my heavenly father does that and this goes on down to my grandchildren my grandson they're my sons my granddaughters are my daughters and I'll tell you Papa's proud they make me proud and I am proud to be their papa amen come on now I want you to I want you to understand I don't want them afraid of me I want them to trust me I want them to love me and God is the same kind he does not want his children afraid of him he wants them to know they have his support [Applause] they have his love that they are the apple of his eye that they are his Joy that he would leave all of Heaven just for you he would come from Glory this morning just for you he would come speak the word just for you that you are imparted in his eyes you cannot be forgotten you cannot be forsaken you cannot be neglected your request cannot be turned down what you say to him is valuable he listens every time you cry I'll be away next Sunday I would have probably preached long anyway but I'm going to take a little bit from next Sunday whoever preaches here can cut it a little short I'm going to steal some of their time but I would borrow from next Sunday even if I was going to be here Paul would sum it up in Romans 7 about the struggle of our flesh you see in the Old Testament under the law there was only one birth and man was birthed in the Sin and there was no new birth that would birth you into righteousness so righteousness under the law of his works you could not be born into righteousness but in the New Testament that's not so we have a new birth and now that birth says replaces Us in relationship with God we are actually his offspring I pray that Revelation Dawns on your heart I am his offspring I'm his DNA I mean it's genetics I'm his kind I cannot help but come into His image Paul summed it up in Romans 7 the struggle between our flesh this born of our first birth and showed us how through Christ that we have broke through we broke free of sins bondage and now we experience that glorious Liberty of freedom from the Yoke of sin now under the law we we differed nothing from a servant we were servants but under grace we are not treated as servants we are treated as Sons as Offspring now remember if you're a lady remember you're still sons of God just like I'm bride of Christ because of being in the church so you're we're all sons of God male and female sons of God just like as I said I'm bride of Christ not physically but because I'm in the church and the church is the bride because God would use one man to symbolize his work as the groom he would use a multitudes of people to symbolize his work as a bride as a people it's called a church so under the law we were servants but under grace we are treated as Sons under the law was blessings and cursings bless if we obeyed cursed if we didn't and we didn't have the power to completely obey you see this made us wretched men but when Jesus came and provided a way out of servanthood into the Glorious Liberty of Jesus Christ it it left it left us to ourselves as almost like two people that our flesh is aligned with the law of sin but now our renewed mind is fixed on submitted to God's righteous truth so we are the inside has been born again yet the outside still needs a change or its own New Birth so we will be born again into a new body that would never smoke never drank never had evil thought it's a match to our soul now so the Bible tells us and I'm not even going to refer to the scripture because I well I'll refer to it it'll be Romans 8 but I don't want you putting it on the screen I want you just to listen because I'm going to paraphrase it because he brings it down and he says now the case is closed there remains no accusing voice of accusation against those who are joined in life Union with Christ Jesus so there's no accusing voice of condemnation that comes to God under the law there was always condemnation you can never measure up try as hard as you could you could not keep it perfectly and there was only one birth under there but under the birth of the New Testament we are born again and when we're born again we are born of a righteous line and we are righteous because of of our birth he has made us righteous the Bible's actually said he became our sins that we could become his righteousness so you look over at your neighbor right now and just say I am the righteousness of God therefore you can pray the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous man it back because you are the righteousness of God not because you did everything right but because of your New Birth by faith he has imputed righteousness to you that in spite of your weaknesses he is making up Sarah for your weaknesses to make you strong so the law uh the law of the spirit of life has liberated us from the law of sin and death and for God achieved what the law was unable to accomplish because the law was limited by weakness of human nature yet God sent his son in human form to identify with human nature and human weakness where he was tempted in all points like we are clothed with Humanity he gave his body to be a sin offering so that God could once and all condemn the guilt and the power of sin so God condemned the guilt and the power of sin at Calvary and he bore the price for your Redemption the punishment that you deserve was upon him so already he cannot punish you he took your punishment he cannot send you the hell he went to hell for you somebody with me so every righteous requirement of the law is now fulfilled in Christ living his life in us and we are free to live not according to our flesh but by the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost and now Christ lives his life in you and even though your body may be dead because of the effects of sin his life-given Spirit imparts Light to you because you are accepted by God look at your neighbor and said I have been accepted by God that's what the Holy Ghost did when he came it was his word I have accepted you and you did not receive the spirit of God ever being good enough and never being able but you received the spirit of full acceptance and folded you into the family of God and you will never feel orphaned as he rises up within us our Spirits join with him with words of tender words saying beloved father [Music] the spirit itself Bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God God owns us as his own and we're children then we are Heirs of God and join us with Christ listen to brother Branham and I'm closing real close now so I'm convinced that every detail of Our Lives is completely continually woven together to fit into God's perfect plan of bringing good into our lives for we're lovers who have been called to fulfill his design purpose what's now and brother Brandon said how much faith can you use the trouble of it is I found that with with the fundamentalists and independent positionally they know where they are or who they are or what they are but the next is Pentecostals they have faith and and yet they don't know who they are he said it's like a man that's got a lot of money in the bank but he can't write a check and others God he can write it check but they ain't got no money in the bank if I could ever get them two together right in other words if I could get a person to realize his position in Christ that he's not rejected he's not orphaned he's not on his own he God's not out to give me he's a loving father he loves us he knows how to show his love somebody help me now then if I could get them to precisely know who they are and then have the faith that the Pentecostals have and bring them together faith in their position somebody with me Faith in what God Said I am faith in my forgiveness faith in his Mercy faith in his healing if I could ever get them together he said this nation would see a shaking like it never before signs and wonders would appear everywhere if you could get Pentecostal faith and fundamental people together so this message it's designed is to get take fundamental truths and doctrines but then we neglect faith because people go one way or the other so brother random said Satan will try to make it all mechanics and no Dynamics are all Dynamics and no mechanics if I can get the two together somebody knowing their position the Pentecostals receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that makes them part fellowship with in relationship with God that's born again and the son and daughter of God tell them out the Bible and they believe it the thing of it is they forget who they are they think well I don't know oh brother you that's born again your sons and daughters of God co-equal With Jesus Christ in his present that's what makes the Devils angry is Let the Church of God realize who they are oh you great Living Church of living God you have claimed to have kissed the blessings off the realm of the Cross sometimes I wonder God would ever take you his gospel and Shake you to a place to realize who you are and the rights that you have been given Hallelujah so we are heirs with him notice here he says for he knew all about us before we were born and he destined us from the beginning to share the likeness of Jesus Christ this is what you're going to be I don't care where you're at this morning this is what you're going to be you're going to be like Jesus but I have this right you're going to you're going to be like him amen listen this means that he's the oldest amongst the vast family of brothers and sisters who come become just like him having determined our destiny ahead of time he called us to himself he transferred his perfect righteousness to everyone he called and those who possessed his perfect righteousness he glorified with his son watch now once you catch this so he co-glorified you he made you co-equal with Jesus Christ he made you to be sin or he made him to be sin for us who knew no sin so that you could become his righteousness so how can he cast us away how can he refuse this audience how can he refuse our request he is a good good father asking you shall receive shall be opened every persistent person will get what he asked for every persistent Seeker would discover what he needs everyone who knocks persistently will will find the door open amen he says look I know I know I'm a father let me ask you this this is the words of Jesus can I get you with me just one few more minutes just a few let me ask you this do you know of any father this is the words of Jesus do you know of any father that would give his son a snake a serpent on a plate when he asked for fish of course not do you know of any father that would give his son a scorpion when he asked for an egg I'm hungry Daddy give him a scorpion I'm hungry Daddy give him a snake he says if imperfect parents know how to lovingly take care of their children and give them what they need how much more will the perfect Heavenly Father give the holy spirit's fullness when his children ask him amen so he says the Lord will give Grace and Glory and and no good thing well he withhold from them that walk uprightly and the only ones who cannot walk uprightly are sons of the blood is cleansed now let's go back to Roman star so what does all this mean if God has determined to stand with us tell me then who could ever stand against us if God has proved This Love To Us by giving up his greatest treasure the gift of his son and freely offered him as a sacrifice for us all amen he certainly won't withhold anything else that he has to give if he gave Christ come on if he gave himself wouldn't he give you healing would he give you finances when he supplied her needs come on if God proved if my given is greater his love won't he give you freely all things who would dare who would dare accuse Those whom God has chosen and loved to be his God is himself as a judge who has issued the final verdict not guilty Hallelujah this is a Justice the judge's final version verdict not guilty Satan they're not guilty if they didn't disrespect they're not guilty but I saw not guilty [Applause] [Music] charges against them have been laid on me I have paid the debt as they are free to go then if God will not accept the devil's accusation then who is left to condemn us certainly not Jesus amen he gave his life for us and even more than that he conquered death and has not risen exalted and thrown at God's right hand so how could he possibly be because different since he is continually praying for our victory [Applause] he is what continually praying for our victory continually pray you're going to overcome how can I fail when Jesus is praying for me is like interceding sitting at the right hand of God praying continually they're gonna win they're going to win they 'll win they're gonna win Hallelujah Hallelujah Moses with his hands lifted high was the sign it's all well the battle's going good we are winning he got Wings men come along and propped it up but Jesus went to Calvary and had his hands nailed to the cross amen hallelujah it's a sign to us you are winning you're not losing you're winning you're gonna overcome this you're coming through this you will not be defeated who then could ever separate us from the Endless Love Of Christ absolutely no one nothing in the universe has the power to diminish his love toward us troubles Treasures problems are unable to come between us and Heaven's love what about persecutions and the deprivations and dangers and death threats oh no they're no longer they they are all important to hinder omnipotent love even as though it's written for all day long we Face threats to yourself for your sake of God we're considered to be nothing more than sweet sheep to the slaughter yet in the midst of all these things we try up over them all but God has made us to be more than conquerors come on let the musicians come amen me and made us be more than conquerors say it with me more than conquerors and is demonstrated aloud is our glorious victory over everything else so now I live in confidence that there is nothing in the universe with the power that separate us from God's love I'm convinced his love will triumph over death more for life's Trouble Over evil Fallen Angels over sin over sickness over dark rulers in the heavens there is nothing present or future circumstances that can weaken his love and his attitude toward me there is no power above us or beneath us no power can be found in the universe that can distance us from God's passionate love which is lavished on us by our father the Lord Jesus Christ the anointed one Hallelujah lavished on you lavished on you there's no reason to fear amen there's no reason to fear you're standing complete the virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ if you're his workmanship his craftsmanship his masterpiece when he chose your lump of clay he knew exactly the potentials that he would bring out of you when other looked at it and said that Joe he's a worthless boy he described his self the other day in lawyers I'm not going to use but there was a sinner lost people say no chance no hope but God had him in his mind before the world began Aaron and an idolatry a worshiper false gods a man and sin aimless without Direction didn't look like he would ever amount to nothing but God saw potential Tim Pruitt man a boy he'll never amount to nothing he'll be a forever kid well I He makes himself the way he is he wants to be petted he cares about he's so lazy somebody else all the things said about me lies but I didn't become none of them because my heart got turned you do not have to become what the devil has lied over you the neglect of some father or mother or her brother or sister this and did this or that one did that and and I was harmed and I was abused and I I forget it look at his love he said I'll never leave you or for sick I'm not going to obey you you'll never be an orphan I'll never be to leave you alone you're mine and I claim you you're my child you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the Living God every man or woman that's born to the spirit of God washed in the blood of Jesus and believes every
