mistakes you would make he knew the failures that you would have but he still loved you he didn't care how far and sin he was going to go he still loved you and that just amazes me every time i think about it the grace of god the look beyond all my faults to save me amen if you have your bibles let's turn to isaiah 54 and 16 it's good to be here again this evening it's good to have my wife and my little my little guy with me ethan it's it's uh always wonderful to have them travel with me i'm sure as brother joe knows you go to new places you don't know too many people but there's one person you're going to know everywhere you go and that's your wife so there's nobody else to talk to you can always talk to your wife so i always enjoy her traveling around with me amen before we read let's bow our heads dear heavenly father lord it's an honor coming to your house and into your presence lord as we've sang songs of worship father and we feel your presence and your your anointing here lord god there's no doubt there's many needs that are here father lord the neighbor might not know the needs lord me as a minister might not know the needs father but you know exactly each one of the needs that are in this building father and as i lay myself aside i ask that you would anoint this vessel father you place the gift on the inside of my life lord and i lay thy gift back in your hands father speak to the people tonight we ask these things in your precious name amen isaiah 54 and 16 behold i have created myth that bloweth the coals and the fire that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and i have created the waster to destroy no weapon that has formed against thee shall prosper and you may be seated this evening i like i said sunday i'm just a simple preacher so i have a a simple subject tonight my subject would be the contrast and i just want to start off by saying that i believe every son and daughter of god is born with a purpose you're not here just by accident you're not here just for just for any reason but you're here for a purpose and god has a purpose for your life that nobody else can fulfill brother branham would say we are made for a purpose this church was built for a purpose the foundation was not dug the cornerstone laid the blocks laid in the building the roof and the interior was not put here just to see if it could be done but it was pit here for a purpose for by a purpose for a purpose your home that you live in was not just accidentally put there or somebody just wasting time your home was made for a purpose to serve a purpose and i started to think about it this building was prettier for a purpose how much more are you and i put here for a purpose the devil would like to come in and tell young people tell adults to say you know you're here by accident mom and dad didn't really they don't love you this one don't love you you're here you've got no purpose on the earth but i'm here to tell you that you want to be here unless you have a purpose brother branham goes on to say that the car we drive was made for a purpose it wasn't just made to see if it could be done but it was made for a purpose the materials wasn't made by man our mother wasn't made by men just to see if it could be done but it was made for a purpose and he says we're not here just to eat food that god has grown we're not here just to drive cars that man has made i live in a house that man has made but he says we're here for a specific purpose and nobody else can fulfill the purpose that god has placed on each one of our lives brother branham says that nature has a purpose nature is just expressing what god is doing in the believer's life he says does that the tree dies the plant dies he says as easter comes around they come back again that's expressing what god is doing in the believer's heart when we pass away we're going to rise up again that is just it's just a type of us so if that has a purpose for them just being a type of us how much more do we have a purpose being here on earth brother branham would say no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are how unimportant you are you are here to serve a purpose just as my finger is here for a purpose my nail or my finger is for a purpose my eye every part of our body is to serve a purpose it was not just put here to see what it would look like but it was put here to serve its purpose it was god's divine plan to do so and i like how he puts that no matter how big you are how little you are how important you are how unimportant you are so it don't matter if you feel the lowest of the lowest you've got a purpose or if you feel like you're the greatest of the greatest you've got a purpose and just bear with me as i lay a little foundation here but nothing happens by accident brother branham would say you were all pre-planned by god nothing happens by chance with god he knows all about it it's all pre-play and planned from many generations back so that you can be here tonight did you know that my that distract me he says god has been working for or for for your life for your purpose for your nature for many generations back so nothing happens by accident you may say well my mom and daddy got divorced or or this happened and that happened it all happened for a purpose so that you can be here you know brother branham would say that he his mama and dad was put together for a purpose his grandparents were put together so that he would have the nature that he would have and i don't believe that's just for the prophet but god has been working on your purpose on your nature for many generations back and let me say this the devil cannot does not have enough power enough ability to destroy the purpose that god has on your life you know brother branham would say that god knew your hair color he would knew the stature that you would have he knew the makeup he knew if you would have freckles he knew if you would have red hair god knows everything about us and then we limit god to our circumstances we limit god to what we go through we limit god to our trials but let me say this evening if we take the limits of god just watch what god will do in our lives the trial ain't too big for god the circumstance ain't too big for god the lies that the devil is telling you ain't too big for god but take the limits off of god and know that no matter what you go through god knew you would be going through it brother branham would say god knows the end from the beginning therefore he could plan everything that would work out for his glory that gives us courage to know no matter what comes or what goes god is making everything the time is or the clunk is ticking just exactly on time but then he says sometimes we get weary upset we get hastily we think oh we must do that or we must do this but remember god's clock will be just exactly on time therefore he can make everything work according to his big time clock that is ticking away he could foretell the yen from the beginning therefore he know we will live in this day he knew this would be our day and he's got plans for this day he's got planned plans for every day and nothing ever has one of his plans ever failed he's always on time oh that place is the courage of my heart if i'm in the valley of the shadow of death that don't destroy the purpose if i'm in the lion's den that don't destroy the purpose if i'm in a fiery furnace that don't destroy the purpose and when we're on the mountaintop that doesn't mean we've got a greater purpose our purpose never changes no matter how high we are how low we are the purpose of god never changes and we go we don't go a day without him knowing about it isaiah 46 and 9 remember the former things of ode for i am god and there was none else i am god and there was none like me declaring the end from the beginning from ancient times to things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure like i said we put limits on god he knows the end from the beginning he knew you'd be sitting in this building you know why he knew you'd be sitting in this building because he knows the end from the beginning so the devil thinks that he can pull one on god and put you through trials and put you through circumstances but god knew exactly what the devil would put you through he didn't just know it but he allowed the devil to put you through hard times he allows he thinks the devil thinks he's bigger than what he really is and we think the devil is bigger than what he really is but he can't do nothing to your life unless he asks god permission oh my and if he asks god's permission then he knows you've got the strength to make you through it oh come on somebody he knows you've got enough strength to make it through it or what's the bible say you don't put more on us than what we can bear you may see brother josh you don't know where i'm at this morning i don't but i know the same god that was with the three hebrew boys he's in the fiery furnace with you take the limits off god receive them take the limits of god in your life and watch what god would do oh my the bible says in isaiah 58 or 55 and 8 for i know that for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither my ways your ways saith the lord and oh my that place is the courage in my heart because sometimes i wake up and i don't feel like a son of god i wake up i don't feel like i'm going to make a rapture i wake up and i feel like i'm backslidden though my thoughts change concerning me god's thoughts never change concerning me oh my the thoughts of god are eternal so if god's thoughts towards you is eternal that means no matter what comes against you your purpose will never be destroyed the next verse for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways my thoughts higher than your thoughts so that means i might not understand everything but i know one thing his ways are higher than my ways and his thoughts are higher than my parts but i like my opening scripture behold i have created the the one that bringeth forth the instrument but i've also created the waster to destroy so he's talking about the contrast but then he stops and he says no weapon that is formed against you is going to prosper you know i never put two and two together i've read about the contrast and i read about that next scripture but that just stood out to me he's given the devil permission to destroy the world he's given the devil permission to destroy this life to destroy that life but once it comes to my instruments no weapon that you're gonna form against my instrument ain't gonna prosper i don't care what you put them through i've got a purpose in their life and i'm going to give you some things i'm going to i'm going to let you touch job's life you can take his family away you can take his livelihood stalk away you can you can i'm going to give you permission to touch his body but once it comes to his purpose when it comes to his life you cannot touch his life oh even his wife turned against job this greatest companion turned against him but god says that's as far as you're going to go you can't touch his purpose your friends may have turned against you your family members may have turned against you your parents may have turned against you your wife may have turned against you your husband may have turned against you but he cannot touch the purpose that is on your life come on somebody get a courage about yourself and say devil no weapon that's your formula this my life is going to prosper because i've got a purpose i'm not here by accident i'm here to destroy the gates of hell i'm here to bring down every stronghold i'm here to bring down the enemy and devil i don't care what you put me through it's not touching my purpose hallelujah that's a revelation that we can grab a hold of and say devil back up oh you remember the story but i brought the brand we had a vision i believe and there was a little devil that come up to him and he would say boo and brother branham jumped back and the devil got bigger and he says it again boo brother branham jumped back and that devil got bigger and kept getting bigger and bigger and all of a sudden brother branham came to himself and something struck and he stopped and he says boo back to the devil the devil got bigger got smaller and brother branham got bigger he realized that no weapon that was formed against him was going to prosper and this evening no weapon get some courage about yourself in the midst of the contrast in the midst of the hard times don't back up against the devil turn to the devil and say boo i've got a purpose boo i'm predestinated boo i'm elected now watch that devil have to go back to hell where he belongs the devil don't belong in your mind that devil don't belong in your thoughts that devil don't belong in your body that devil belongs in hell and let me say you've got the power to send that devil back to where he belongs you don't get to listen to that lie any longer come on somebody you don't gotta listen to those spots any longer for greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world oh glory to god you see both are taking place god is building up the devil is destroying but i don't matter how strong the waster is he can't destroy the purpose on your life and this is a scripture that we've all memorized but too many times we read scripture time and time and time again and we fail to see the true meaning behind scripture romans 8 29 says for whom he did for no he also did predestinate so he's saying here you're not here by accident you've got a purpose you mean therefore no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of the son that he might be the firstborn among many brothers moreover whom he did predestinate then me also called whom he called then he also justified whom he justified he also glorified so he sees he's making a statement here he's making this clear you've got a purpose you're not here by accident then he says what shall we say to these things if god before us if we've got a purpose if you're elected if you're predestinated if you're chosen for this moment what waster can be against you and i say this even if god before you if you've got a purpose i don't care what the waster is sending your way nothing could destroy the purpose oh my the 35th verse who shall separate us from the love of god oh my nothing's going to separate me from the love of god or tribulation or distress persecution famine necklace pearl sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay and all of these things in the midst of the contrast in the midst of the waster and they and all of these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded we need to get some people that's persuaded not just guessing not just not not just thinking about it but persuading i'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor angel principalities powers nor things present uh the circumstance i'm in or the circumstance that i'm going to go in will never be able to destroy the purpose that god has in my life oh my well more than conquerors brother branham would say now we want to draw this first into our minds that there is not one thing that can destroy us until the purpose of he who created us he who created us has been fulfilled but that would then create you come on somebody the waster didn't create you they the god created you and that means no matter what you go through it can never destroy the purpose you may see what about those ones that are die that is with the way of the grave their purpose was fulfilled oh my oh grave where was your sting death where was your victory this was somebody their purpose on earth was fulfilled but now they've got a greater purpose they've got a greater purpose so death thinks he pulls one on god but god says oh no their purpose on earth is fulfilled now i'm calling them up to a higher purpose oh hallelujah you see the contrast ain't meant to destroy the purpose it's meant to magnify the purpose you know in our laundry room loretta painted three of the walls white and one of the wall is a dark blue and what that does it creates a contrast and that dark wall pops but in this case there's more darkness than there is light there's sin there's perversions there's this and there's that but all that is doing is making the bride of christ pop in the midst of the contrast in the midst of the perversion there's a privacy not going down she's going up there's a bride that's not being defeated but she's overcoming oh my so what the devil is doing he don't realize that i'm gonna pull a timothy prince dumbo devil he thinks he's destroying the purpose but all he is doing is magnifying the purpose so every trial you go through says thank you devil you're just magnifying my purpose on earth thank you waster you're just magnifying what god has called me to do how could you fight devils if no devils come against you how could you overcome sicknesses if you was never sick how could you die how could you break the shackles if you was never bound but it takes the contrast to reveal greater is he that is in you don't curse god in the hard times don't curse god in the trial don't curse god but look to god and say thank you for having confidence in me oh it was god i told the devil asked him what are you up to oh just roaming to and fro seeking one i may desire seeking who i'm going to destroy then god says you know what i'm going to allow a contrast there's somebody on earth that has a purpose and i want to show the devil his true purpose come on now i want to show the devil his true purpose so we asked him have you considered my servant job have you ever have you considered him he goes oh yeah but you've got a hedge around me he goes you know what fine fine i'm gonna make you a deal i'm going to take the hedge off of him i'm going to take the hedge off of him you try to destroy him he goes oh yeah you just watch i'm going to make him curse him curse you to your face and god says oh no in the back of his mind he knew the purpose was greater than the waster god knows you're not going to curse god this let me turn away that one may turn away this one may blaspheme but god knows there's something inside of you that can't turn away from the message can't turn away from his grace can't turn away from his love and the only thing that the devil is doing is showing that the purpose can never be destroyed but you notice you notice what job said after the trial the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be thy holy name the contrast never took his praise away the contrast never took his worship away he lost his lively stock he lost his he lost his children he lost his wife and we stubbed our toe when we lose our worship i'm preaching now we stubbed our toe where we our co-worker gets an attitude and we lose our worship we need to grow up and realize our purpose ain't to be defeated our person our purpose is to rise above every circumstance rise above every child rise above everything we go through and give god the glory in the midst of it all the lord giveth and the lord taketh away but waster you're not taking my praise come on somebody you're not taking my praise you're not taking my worship it may be the midnight hour i may be in a jail cell but i'm still going to praise god then what did he say i have heard of god by the hearing of the year but now my eye seethy so it took the contrast to get job from just hearing about god now to seeing god it took the hard times for job to realize this ain't just the god of moses it ain't the god of elijah it ain't the god of abraham but this is the god of job but how did he realize that because of the contrast oh my how like i said earlier how would you know god could heal if he was never sick but it takes the contrast to magnify the beauty of the power of god there's been many times when he was first married there was times we didn't have money for our bills and we called to be called the bank to see if we could push our loan back a few weeks and to get us some so we can get some more money and uh and we call the bank and the bank says what do you mean the loan's paid for for the month oh my what we didn't pay it we didn't have the money for it but that took the contrast the show no matter what we go through everything is in his control another time we knew we had a certain amount in the bank we called the bank to make sure it was doubled it was the contrast that revealed to us that no matter what we go through what we go through god is always in the midst of the contrast but how could i tell those testimonies if we didn't go through it at the time we thought those were going to destroy us we didn't know how was going to make it through it but you notice what the contrast did it drove us to our knees hey it takes the circumstances to get us on our knees too many times it's the truth anyhow but it was this contrast that caused us to get to our knees and say god i don't know what we're going to do i got laid off from my job it was the winter time so i couldn't go i do landscape in the summer times so i couldn't go and do landscape i felt helpless as a man it's not always there's not a worse feeling than knowing you can't provide for your family but they took that to get me to the lowest of the lowest where i couldn't look down anymore the only way i can lower the only direction i can look was up it took the contrast to get me to look up don't curse god in the hard times he's wanting to reveal himself to you in a greater way you know brother branham says that before the world was created the god inside of god was attributes attributes to be a healer a deliverer a savior a father but he was god alone he was elohim i believe and since he was god alone there was nobody to reveal those attributes to and so what happened when god allowed the devil to come into the garden and cause the contrast and now that they're sin their sickness because there's sin there's bondage because there's sin there's this and there's that now god can show himself as a deliverer he can reveal himself as a healer so god allowed the devil to come in the garden so that he can reveal himself the devil can't do nothing without god knowing about it oh my and so now that the devil caused eve to fall there's man that's going to hell so now god said yes i can reveal myself as a redeemer there's man with the with the fallen nature now i can show myself as a savior but it took the contrast oh this is okay this evening it took the contrast for god to reveal himself you look at romans 9 and 17 for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this same purpose have i raised thee up that i might show my power in thee inside of pharaoh how's this even possible god was allowing pharaoh to harden his heart so that god can reveal himself through the children of israel that i might show my power in thee that my name might be declared throughout all of the earth you notice you notice when the spies got in the jericho what did we have the harlot say we have heard what y'all did to the egyptians and the men's hearts have become fainted how did that take place because of the contrast how come the devil's afraid of this pride because of the contrast [Applause] hey it's the truth anyhow how come he knows that no weapon formed against you is going to prosper because of the contrast but at the same time this is going on exodus 9 and 12 and the lord heart in the heart of pharaoh and he hearken not unto them as the lord hath spoken to moses and the lord said unto moses so as his heart was being hardened he didn't leave moses by himself oh my your circumstances may be getting hard but god hasn't left you by yourself he's still there the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning stand before pharaoh and say unto him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me so at the same time pharaoh was saying no god was given moses a visitation god can still visit you in the hard times dawkins still speak to you in the fiery furnace oh my god you know you notice oh this is okay nebuchadnezzar looked down and i believe it was nebuchadnezzar i hope i got the right person look down in the fiery furnace it says i thought we threw three in there how come there's a fourth one in there that looks like the son of god even the waster knows there's a god on earth because of the contrast i know it's simple but it's good preaching it was because of the contrast that the waster knew that he couldn't destroy the purpose but you think the devil will learn that he can't destroy the purpose oh my you notice the definition of waster this just stood out to me to destroy to corrupt to ruin to decay to pervert that definition stood out to me waster is too perverted brother branham says that the devil can't create he can only pervert so he takes what god has created and perverts it for his own gain brother branham says satan's only power he's god is the perverted power of god it isn't a real power oh my it isn't a real power it's a perversion of god's power everything that satan has death is only a perverted life a lie is only the truth mistoad adultery is an act misused a righteous act misused see everything that satan has god is something that is perverted but it's a power and here we are today sitting here one or the other power is going to control us so let us cast out the evil one let's take our position like the stars of the heavens oh my so the power that the devil's got is only a perversion so that means it don't got the authority that the original is god so why would we want to come under the power of a knockoff when we can come under the authority of the genuine like i said sunday there's there there's many counterfeits out there but there's no counterfeit 44 bill because there's not a genuine out there but you notice the five counterfeit five dollar bill don't got the purchasing power that a real five dollar bill's got so the devil may thinks he's got you but he's got no power to hold you until you realize that he's a fake the only way you can realize the only way that you come to a realization that you're that you've got a counterfeit is to match the two together then you realize i've got a counterfeit i've got no power then you got to get the genuine because the one you've got that's no power and that's the way it is with the perverted power of the devil you've got to realize this is a perversion there's an original out there somewhere that can pull me out of this trial that could pull me out of this hard time oh my you look at the the disciples was on the on the sea fearing for their lives the waves were starting to roar and now the boats were starting to rock back and forth but you notice before the waves or before the storm was the water before the storm was that was the rain before the storm was the wind so the devil took what god had created and created the va and took that and perverted it you see the water wasn't created to destroy the boat the wind wasn't created to destroy the boat the water wasn't created to destroy the boat but the perverter took what god created the original and perverted it but it didn't matter how big thou storm was brother branham says there was thousands of demons now swore to take that boat to the bottom of the ocean but they couldn't you know why because jesus says let us go to the other side he gave a command he gave them a purpose we're not going across the ocean by accident we're not just going to see what's on the other side but i'm giving you a purpose let us go to the other side and what happened as long as the disciples was looking up the perversion jesus remained asleep as long as you're looking at the perversion jesus is going to remain asleep you need to quit looking at the trials quit looking out the circumstances quit looking at the perverter and wake up the creator [Applause] what happened they woke up jesus it says do you care that we perish he got up and he says where's your faith don't you know who i am but since they didn't know who he really was they were focused on the perverter too many people lack an experience with god so every trial they go through their backslide every circumstance they go through their backside that curse god but you'll get an experience not of a perverted power but of the original power it anchors something on the inside that god's never going to leave me he's never going to forsake me but he's going to be with me to the end of the world what happened jesus got up and he says peace be still and what happened the perversion went back to its original state the water went back to the way it was before the perversion oh i hope you're catching it this evening the creators in the building look away from the perversion and let the original creator take the perversion and restore it back to the original the trial ain't meant to destroy you the circumstances meant to destroy you but let the creator take the contrast what do the disciples say what manner about man is this that the winds and the waves obey him it was the contrast that revealed to them that he was god it took the hard times to reveal to them that he was god oh my but you notice what was on the other side of that storm on the other side of that storm was the man that needed to get in front of jesus what if they wouldn't have pressed through that storm what if god was like us too many times says oh it ain't worth it i'm not going to go to church oh i'm not going to read my bible i'm not going to pray i'm not going to do this if god had the same attitude that we had too many times where would we be tonight oh this is okay but there was a man on the other side of the storm that was in a perversion that needed to be restored to the original so that means they had to press many times we got to press we got to press through the storm we got to press through the winds we gotta press through the waves so that we can get in front of the creator you know brother branham says the legion had a wife and some children so what happened once he got in front of god and got in front of christ he was set free and brother brandon says he went back to his wife and children so he went back to the state that he was in before the perversion that's what happens when you left the creator to deal with the perversion we're not meant to deal with the perversion god is meant to deal with the perversion as long as the disciples was trying to keep the boat afloat yeah always get that mixed up as long as they were trying to do it themselves the creator couldn't take the perversion but that when they stopped and says god we can't do this that's when the creator came on the scene we need to stop trying to whip up on the devil in iron ability it's not going to happen you're not going to do it you're not smarter than the devil you're not stronger than the devil but there's the creator that can take every circumstance and turn it for your good take every trial and turn it for your good take everything you go through and turn it for your good we're looking up the perversion and look to the creator oh hallelujah look to the creator so i'm gonna move on and make it a little more personal what's a complex a complex is the original thoughts of god that the devil has perverted and now we're so focused on the perversion we can't come to church no more hope this is okay brother joe we're so focused on the perversion we can't go to youth gatherings no more we're so focused on the perversion we can't listen to the pastor no more because he's got something against me you know it's like the story in the bible in the old testament i believe it was the syrians had sieged samaria and they had cut off their water supply they had surrounded the city and they were inside of a wall city that they had created to defend themselves they didn't want to get hurt so they created a wall city to defend themselves and that's what a complex is you don't want to get hurt so you build up walled city but what happened on the inside of the wall city the bible says a famine took place a drought took place it got so bad that women were starting to eat their babies they were eating their own children because of the walled city and what happens though in a complex the ones you love the most get hurt your family members get hurt your parents get hurt your children gets hurt because of a walled city that you built up to protect yourself while everybody was stuck inside of this city there was some lepers that sit at the gate that says you know what are we going to sit here till we die are we just going to sit here in this perversion are we going to let this complex take every bit of christ out of us are we going to let their sickness take every bit of faith out of me or we going to fight this thing we need to quit giving in to the devil and get some grit about us and say i'm not backing down i'm not laying down but i'm going to fight for every inch of ground i'm going to press my way to christ so that the creator can take the perversion and turn it back to the original what happened so these lepers says are we going to sit here till we die they walked out of the city and there was nobody there that's what a complex is you build up a wall because your friends don't like you you build up a wall because the pastor don't like you you build up a wall because brother joe don't like you but in reality there's nothing even there just walk out of the walls walk out of the city walk out of those complexes walk out of that perversion because outside of the wall is water inside of that complex you're thirsting for fellowship at the inside of that complex you're hungering for the move of god but you can't have it inside of that wall city but walk out of the wall city there's food there's water there's fellowship there's a renewing for you there's the holy ghost for you there's deliverance for you there's salvation for you walk out of that wall city are we going to sit here until we die walk out of the perversion and get some food this evening god loves you the pastor loves you mama loves you walk out of that perversion and let the creator take the perversion and turn it back to the original oh my no weapon that has formed against you that includes complexes is going to prosper i don't care what those thoughts are that says you're not good enough you're too ugly you're too fat you're too skinny i'm sure there's some complexes that says you're too purty a complex is going to turn anything you can against you but walk out of the perversion walk out of the perversion god made you exactly the way he wanted you what happens when you're in a complex you can't fulfill the purpose that god has for you that's the devil knows he can't destroy the purpose so he puts you in a situation where you can't fulfill your purpose hey that's pretty good he can't destroy it but he allows a perversion to create around your mind you build up you're working for the devil you're working for the devil he's handing you the brick and you're piling up there you're getting some mortar you're piling it on there and the devil was right behind you laughing at you i got him now he's building his own prison cell he's proved he's building his own prison wall but they're seeing the devil we're walking out of the city the creator has opened up the prison cell opened up the walls so that we can walk out of the perversion oh my jeremiah 29 and 11 for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord fonts of peace not of evil to give you an expected end not thoughts of evil water complexes fonts of evil but that's not the original thoughts of god that's a perversion that the devilish took off of the original oh my but the branham says there has been so much mockery in the name of divine healing there's been so much mockery in the phrase of religion but there's a real power of the holy spirit that delivers the human being glory to god that delivers the human being from the bondage of sin there's a real power of the holy spirit that delivers the sufferer from his suffering the devil's got a perverted power but there is the real power that can take you from complexes take you from anxiety let's deal with anxiety what's the anxiety it's the peace the pathophile understanding that's been perverted now you're scared to even drive you're scared to walk out of your home you're scared to go here you're you're scared to get close to somebody because you're afraid they're going to hurt you you're afraid of this and afraid of that that's a perversion that wasn't myth for you you're meant to have a peace a sound mind a power oh come on somebody i'm saying this evening you don't got to stay in the perversion walk out of the perversion and start to manifest the purpose that god has for you oh hallelujah ii timothy 1 7 for god has not given us a spirit of fear but a power of love and of a sound mind that's the real spirit i'm talking about of power of love you know you don't know what that person done to me you know what we did to christ we're the ones that put him on the cross and so what happens bitterness starts to come in i hope this is okay tonight bitterness starts to come in because that one did you wrong and so what that is doing is a perversion that's perverting your life it's starting to corrupt you from the inside like a cancer you can't see cancer from the outside but on the inside it's eating away that's what bitterness does you don't know what so-and-so did to me 20 years ago i don't care what so-and-so did i know what god did god paid the price so bitterness can be destroyed christ paid the price so that hatred toward your loved one towards your family member whoever it is can be dealt with it's a perversion that's not meant for you let the creator take you to the original oh my let the creator take it back to the original you're saying we don't got no choice to go through trials we don't got a choice to go through perversions but we do have a choice to let the perversion comes on the inside what's the devil after he's after your faith the trials that you go through it's him trying to destroy your confidence in god it's him trying to destroy your confidence in his work so when you go through trials you don't get a choice but you do have a choice to let that come on the inside and disrupt your faith and start to pervert your faith oh what's the bible say in first peter 1 5 who were kept by the power of god through faith you are kept by faith so if the devil can disrupt your faith there's nothing to anchor you no more oh my but as long as you don't let the perversion affect your faith you're anchored you're solid and nothing can move you nothing can shake you under salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein ye greatly rejoice lord now for our season if need be you're in heaviness through manifold temptation the trial of your faith being much more precious than of god that perished though it betrayed with fire might be found in a praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ the trying of your faith is worth more than goals we don't realize the necessity of faith too many times we can't be healed without faith we're not going to see a body change without faith we're not going to see a rapture without faith we can't take the message off of the tape players and manifested without faith and so the trials is trying to destroy your faith are you catching me this evening but we don't gotta we don't gotta allow the devil to destroy our faith oh my brother branham says you see we're either going to let the trial build up our faith or destroy our faith you look at brother branham and his trainer his boxing trainer he was going through trial after trial of the tribal that branham says his trainer would beat up on him hit him knock him out of the ring and brother branham says he got up one time and says are you trying to kill me what is it what are you trying to do he says i'm equipping your body he says the big blows stops the blood and he says once your blood stops you're going to pass out but i'm equipping your body right now with these big blows so that when you're on the ring you can take big blows and while the other ones are falling down for the count you can get back up so brother branham could have seen you know i'm not made for this and walked out of the ring or he could say you know what i'm going to allow the trials to build up my purpose we can either quit in the trial and walk away or we could say i'm going to keep pressing on and let the trial build up my faith you see the trainer wasn't trying to destroy his purpose he was trying to equip him for his purpose oh my god ain't trying to destroy the purpose he's allowing the devil to put you through hard times to equip you for your purpose so now brother branham he was undefeated he won the championship he could gum street got knocked down many times but because of his training he could get back up the other ones will lay down and walk away and the other one your friends may be walking away your loved ones may be walking away but because of your training you're still here because of the trials you're still standing strong on your faith oh my you look at the shooting my woman the street of my woman wasn't able to have a child she wasn't able to look like god was punishing her it looked like god was was sending her through hard times for no reason but it was that trial that created the faith for another trial you know what i'm talking about she wasn't able to have a child so the prophet gave her a child she was barren she couldn't have no children but the prophet gave her a child and later on in the story the child dies but since god gave her a child when she wasn't able to have one she knew that child created the faith if god gave me a trial if god brought me through that one he can take me through this one so what happens she goes to the prophet the prophet says all is well with you all is well all is well with your husband all his will all is well with your baby all is well i know if i can just get in front of the prophet come on somebody if i can just get in front of the one that gave me the promise god gave you a promise he's never going to leave you he's never going to forsake you but he's going to be with you if you can just get in front of the creator this evening the perversion can be re returned back to the original but it took the training to equip her faith it was that trial that built up a faith you see it was in the midst of her brokenness too many times we allow the devil to work in our brokenness we're at our lowest of the lowest the weakest of the weakest and right there we're at a vulnerable point the devil's going to come in and whisper lies to us and he's going to take advantage of our brokenness but god wants to take advantage of your brokenness you may say you don't know where i'm at my heart's crushed i'm this i'm that god's right there to bring you through it but he's waiting for somebody to look to him oh my you see it was jonah's brokenness that god used to win a city you know brother branham says whenever he went to nineveh he says that nineveh worshiped the sea gods and so whenever that well came up and brother branham says he wrote his tongue on the sea or on his hand and jonah came walking off the tongue and he says repent or perish brother branham says they seen their sea god spit out a prophet that says repent or perish it was it was jonah's brokenness that god used to win a city i could just imagine it was just dramatizing for a second jonah's walking out and these men come walking up to him what are you doing why are you here he says repent or perish why well why why does god care about us why is he why did he send you here to save us then he could tell his testimony and say you know what i was running from god i was running for my purpose i was running for my calling but the same god that gave me a second chance he's here to give you a second chance it was his brokenness that god used to win a city and god can use your brokenness to win somebody to christ god can use your brokenness to win your neighbor to win a family member so instead of letting the devil take the brokenness let god take the brokenness the woman up the well used her brokenness to win many souls she ran into the city and says come see a man who told me all that i ever done the bible says in john 4 39 many of the samaritans of the city believed on him for the saying of the woman he told me all i ever done it was her brokenness that god used to win a city you notice christ never went inside of the city but he won somebody through their brokenness and they went into the city don't ever be ashamed of your testimony don't be ashamed of what god did for you you know too many people think well i'm not a preacher god can't use me i'm not a singer god can't use me gifts and callings are without repentance each one of us is here with a calling you may not have any gifts that you can point to but you're still called he separates the two gifts and callings you may say i don't play music i don't sing i don't preach i don't do this that doesn't mean you're not called god's called you for a purpose that the ones with gifts can't fulfill me as the preacher don't get your testimony me as a preacher don't get your testimony but god has given you a calling that i can do hey my brother my brother caleb's not a preacher mean quote we are preachers we're singers we're song leaders we're playing music caleb sometimes feels left out but i told him you've got a testimony i don't got so me as a preacher can't fulfill a purpose that you've got because you've got another calling we need to quit comparing ourselves to this one quit comparing yourselves to that one we're comparing yourselves to each other you've got a calling that you can't only you can fulfill so now when somebody's in drugs i've never been bound to drugs so i can't tell them how god delivered me but caleb can no one ever whenever somebody's bound by drinking i've never been bound by drinking but kayla passed so now he's got something through his brokenness that god can use to save somebody you've got something through your brokenness that god can use for your purpose all things work together for the good according to his purpose so a purpose is never destroyed oh my so we can let that pervert our faith but the brandon says there's a certain amount of faith that goes with satan in order to accept satan you've got to believe satan so there's a perverted faith to a perverted faith so in order for bitterness to set in complex is the set in these other things to set in you've got to accept it you've got no choice to go through it but you do got a choice to let it come in and pervert your faith you know brother branham says in order to believe a lie you've got to reject the truth so in order to believe those complexes you gotta reject what god thinks towards you oh come on somebody in order to accept that anxiety you gotta reject the peace that god's got for you and let me tell you this the complexes are taking you down but god's peace will take you up that faith is going to take you up don't don't let the devil take that away from you what do paul say i've ran my course i finished the race and i've kept my faith he went through shipwreck he was beaten he was scorched he was stoned but none of the perversions took his faith away and he could stand at the end of the day and say devil you tried to destroy me you tried to pervert me but i'm not allowing the perversion to come on the inside i'm going to keep my faith in the word of god i'm going to keep my faith in sight of the word of god inside of my purpose brother branham says he says salvation lasts as long as faith lasts divine healing lasts as long as faith lasts oh my he says your experience 40 years ago forgot you ever had an experience and go out here tonight and say i don't believe in it i'm not god's servant now more watch how long your experience lasts certainly your experience lasts as long as your faith lasts so if you allow the devil to pervert your faith brother branham says a perverted faith is unbelief so whenever your faith starts to be perverted unbelief's coming in and now you're losing your salvation you're losing your joy you're losing your peace you're losing your happiness but you don't got to leave the same way the creators in the building that they restore your peace restore the joy restore the long suffering and give you a revival like never before give your renewing like never before hey too many times we have more expectation for the building cover revival than we do for us to have a revival hey it's something i've been thinking we have a revival this weekend and i started thinking about it we get all prepared i hope it's okay we get all prepared we get food cooked we get a building we get our building set up and everything and we get more expectation for the building than we do for us we have more expectations for this one to be healed this one will be set free than we do we come to church just expecting to hear a good sermon but let's put our expectations a little more personal i don't want just to hear a good sermon i want the god of the sermon to touch me one more time i want the guard of the sermon to renew me revive the fire hey the fire's still there i made us got a little dim but you just need a wind but then brandon says what's the revival he says it's not bringing new converts in it's not fellowshipping he says those things come with them our revival is to revive what you already got so that fire may be a little dim ashamed you look at in the beginning the bible says the spirit of the lord moved on the face of the waters so the spirit of the lord took chaos and made paradise just like we was in chaos and the spirit of the lord took chaos and made paradise for god to live in but you notice the devil came into the garden and because of sin paradise started to be perverted but god ain't going to allow the earth just to pervert away brother branham says the fire that's going to burn the earth is a baptism of fire so it's going to get a renewing even though the spirit of the lord moved in the beginning because of sin his needs are renewing you may have got a touch 30 years ago you may have gone to touch 50 years ago but if the perverter has perverted your faith you need another touch and you're not too old for another touch you're not too young for a touch oh we get in our minds well i've been in the message for 50 years i can't get nothing else from god you're perverted you're perverting oh my i i haven't felt the presence of the lord in 20 years you're perverted but the shame that the creators in the building to take the perversion that you're in and restore the joy of your salvation rekindle the flame that you had 30 years ago rekindle the flame that you had back whenever you first give your heart to god [Applause] brother brandon i i don't got the quote in front of me he says you may say i got touched 30 years ago but he says what about today he says that experience got wiggletails in it oh my that means it's starting to rot it's starting to be perverted so we can't rely on an experience that we got 30 years ago because it's going to start to pervert itself but you need experience today you need one sunday you need one next week oh my it's an experience that god can give us on a daily basis too many times we put our period on we put a period on our experience we're not meant to put a period in our experience our experience is still going to be going when we're on the rapture we're going to experience things we've never experienced before so if we're putting our putting a period on our experience as the musicians come if we're putting an experience or a period in our experience that means god can't do nothing for us anymore but let's take the limits off god let's take the period off and say you know what god there are some things in my life i'm not happy with the perverter has come and perverted some things but tonight i recognize your presence i may not even i may not be able to feel your presence tonight lord because i'm so perverted but tonight i want to feel your presence again i want to have that peace again i want to have that long suffering again i want to have that joy again i want to have that love again walk out of the city tonight walk out of the perversion and allow the creator to restore your joy you know brother branham says that david didn't lose his salvation he lost the joy of his salvation you may have not lost the holy ghost you may have lost the joy of it what's the mean to lose the joy of the holy ghost you're not proud to be a christian no more you're not proud to wear your long skirts no more you're not proud not to wear that makeup no more you're not proud for young men not to wear skinny jeans no more you're perverted you just need a renewing let the holy ghost that fell five years ago last year at youth camp let it come and give you another renewing and let the perverter go away so that the creator can come in let's bow our heads tonight can you just play something soft sister if there's somebody i know this was really chopped up and scattered but if there's somebody that when i say brother josh i want the creator to come by my way there's hands everywhere say brother josh the pervert has come in and it's perverting my joy perverting my peace perverting the fire that i once had but tonight i want the creator to come in their heavenly father lord you see the hands you see the ones that come to the altar lord they don't want to stay in the perversion any longer they don't want to stay in the walled city any longer but they're saying shall we sit here till we die no i'm not going to sit here in this perversion any longer but i'm walking out of this perversion so that the creator can restore my joy lord may the fire of the holy ghost come and touch each individual lord like never before rekindle that flame lord like never before ask these things in your name [Music] can we just lift our hands and sing it tonight is that your desired [Music] me me [Music] me [Music] me [Music] singing [Music]
