========================================

we're so glad that you have joined with us today we're the ministry team of Eden and like Tabernacle and we're discussing some wonderful things today about prophecy about the Word of God and we'd like you to share this with your friends and let them know that we're on today and talking about the good things of the Word of God we we've been talking about the clothes of the Jewish dispensation and how that it came tune in and how that the gospel now would turn to the Gentiles and we find out that when Jesus was there looking at the the temple and and they had showed him the great magnificent temple that Herod had built and and where they were worshiping and and Jesus said it's going to come to pass that there won't be one stone left upon another and so you know after this you know he said they asked him questions about it because there's a whole list of events that Jesus speaks about the end time and a lot of people just kind of glossed through all of them but actually they're broken down into three different answers as Jesus answers three different questions and because they said tell us when shall these things be they've not one stone will be left upon another the temple will be destroyed and then what shall be the sign of that coming and of the end of the world so actually three things that Jesus is dealing with so let's talk about those that's a very good observation when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and the end of the world many times many get confused because when Jesus speaks in Matthew 24 he is speaking to everyone answers to every one of these questions and people misplace time these events with endtime events for example Jesus said pray that your flight not be in the winter nor on the Sabbath day and some people apply that to the world well what why would you apply pray that it not be winter on the Sabbath day if you're in the tropical area you know or what you know pray that your flight not be in the winter if you're in the tropical area or why on the Sabbath day to people that you know this was speaking this particular portion of Matthew 24 was speaking directly to the Jews yes because he knew that Titus was going to come in by prophecy and he said your house is left desolate mm-hmm he knew Titus would come in and actually catch them on the inside of Jerusalem and he was talking to the believers you pray yeah and you watch this side and you pray that your flight not being the winner nor on a Sabbath day because they would the gates would be closed today to be long let me just read it for reference here maybe it would just kind of congeal it for us in Matthew 24 16 then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains let him which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house neither let him which is in the field returned back to take his clothes and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days but pray that your flight be not in the winter neither on the Sabbath day so so this was specifically speaking of the destruction of Jerusalem right absolutely correct Titus 80 70 Jesus prophesied in Luke chapter 19 41 an incredible accurate prophecy and this is one of the greatest destructions the world has ever seen and Jesus spoke of it it's historical in Luke chapter 19 verse 41 he said and when he come near he beheld the city and he wept over it weeping over Jerusalem right saying if thou had known at least this thy day the things which belong in to thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes for the days shall come upon thee that thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compassed the amount and keep thee in on every side and shall lay thee even to the ground by children within thee and they shall not leave in the one stone upon the other because thou knewest not the time of the visitation thy visitation so Jesus is looking 37 years ahead to the Roman general Titus 8070 coming in and he literally built a siege wall around Jerusalem starved him out completely and the people ate their own children they ate the bark off the trees they weeds and he killed according to Josephus I believe it was 1.1 million right Jews those that tried to escape they crucified him and hung them around the city and this horrific judgment was spoke up not just by Jesus but this is where Titus brings the temple down to the ground it was it was terrible they they took over 25,000 Jews and made him fight wild beasts in the amphitheaters right they let off thousands and thousands and into captivity yes it was and it's not that they weren't warned Jesus himself had given them a warning well what does it do to us we don't heed the warnings and the word of God but what about the believers what about those who did hear good question because according to Josephus there there was not one Christian less found inside there because they watch for the sign that Jesus spoke of amazing and he said you pray that your flight not been the winner they were praying they were watching and when they saw the sign they took off and not one was caught in that judgment so you know there was an abomination that makes desolate and of course there's a lot of theories and so on about that and maybe different application but I think of one application that is that is real true the abomination that made Israel our Jerusalem desolate was the rejection of the Messiah when there he came standing in the Holy Place and they rejected him this was truly the real abomination that made Jerusalem desolate is because they did not recognize their day their message and their power of visitation that's right and we saw what it did to them I mean they dispersed them and went everywhere they that was scattered scattered I mean it you had 2,000 years of tribulation for the Jews that's right an unbelievable thing I've been in bucking off and off switch and all them death camps and things that's just part of the history but incredible things they dealt with for you terrible persecution because they did not recognize their day in their hour of visitation yes now you just realize what it's going to happen when a rapture takes place and God takes his elect and then the whole world goes into tribulation where the wrath of God is poured out upon a world and upon a people in the vials the bowls of judgment has been stored up and waiting for that time will be poured out on the earth because once again people did the same thing they make they do the abomination that makes desolate yes that is I reject the Messiah well you see what happened to the Jews for that rejection and you think God is gonna take it any less or take it lightly when the Gentiles have done the same thing when they've rejected yes what he's done for them and rejected the word and then turned to their own ideas their own creeds their own traditions they're gonna suffer the same fate that Israel suffered but in a much shorter amount of time he has to be poured out rapidly upon the world yes so then the Ezekiel a prophesy about this is when one of the most accurate prophecies not accurate but one of the most profound prophecies of the Bible he spoke of Titus in depth in Ezekiel chapter 9 and in verse 1 he says he cried also in my ears if you read Ezekiel 8 you'll find that they had desecrated the temple mm-hmm and now the glory of God is departing from the temple mm-hmm and in Ezekiel 9 1 he said he cried in my ears with a loud voice saying every man with a destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lieth toward the north and every man a slaughtering weapon in his hand one man among them clothed with linen with a writer's inkhorn by his side and they went in and stood beside the brazen altar this man in white with the writers inkhorn is the holy spirit and he's going to mark as we read on and the glory of God of Israel was gone from the cherubim whereupon he was of the to the threshold of the house and he called a man clothed with linen which had the writers inkhorn by his side and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for the abominations done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in my hearing go ye after him after the sealing angel through the city and smite and let not your eyes neither have pity slay utterly old and young both maids little children and women but come not near any man upon whom the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house and he said unto them to file the house and fill the courts with the slain go you therefore I go ye forth and they went forth and slew in the city my god and Titus had filled the courts with the slain and it came to pass while they were slaying them I was left I fell upon my face and cried O Lord God wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in the pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem and he goes on talking about the iniquity of the land this was a direct fulfillment of Titus but before Titus judgment come God sent the sealing angel which was the Holy Spirit which was giving them an opportunity to escape before the judgment God always sends mercy before judgment right this is what is amazing as they saw Jesus and the sign of the Messiah tell the very thoughts of the heart my God and tell them there the the very sins and and seen the healing in the sign of the Messiah and they made fun of it and he said they called him belzebub and he said I'll forgive you but there's one coming after me one word against it see it was before the atonement but after the atonement and God sent the Holy Spirit when the Jews rejected the Holy Spirit and rejected Pentecost yes sir which was the sealing angel right because the seal is the baptism of the Holy Ghost mm-hmm then when a man rejects the light the only thing left is darkness and judgment so we come to another end time and we see also the closing of the Gentile dispensation and the church caught up in tradition and all kinds of different worship that is not scriptural and Biblical kind of very similar to what it is described in Ezekiel chapter 8 and then we see the glory of the Lord leaving between the cherub in other words the Spirit of God is departing from the church system and and there he he's standing at the threshold he's at the door and this is where we find Jesus standing at the door and the outside of the church in laodicea and we find that also the prophecy in Thessalonians where he says the Holy Spirit is lifting he says when they you know let he that let all hell let it and when ìletís will let until he be taken out of the way and so we find the Holy Spirit's lifting from the whole Gentile people yes as the gospel turns back to the Jews but the thing about it is when he is lifting you know we've got to make sure we're part of it that that is lifting with it yes as the world is falling around us that there's a people ascending amen amen amen it's not a part of this fallen world so but there again to go back in this day and reject Pentecost to reject that original experience to turn down the gospel of Christ and the restoration that has happened in this last day leads us to nothing but tribulation once again judgment well Pentecost itself was the pouring out of Jesus spirit from directly from the mercy seat and so essentially when a man receives the Holy Spirit he passes from judgment unto life the Bible said he will not come into the condemnation or judgment but is passed from death unto life so if I am not in Christ I must go to the judgement to answer but if Christ took my judgment then I'm as I am as free as freaking baby so to reject that Pentecostal experience that baptism of the Holy Ghost that seal of the Holy Spirit that becoming a new creature then all there's left his judgment right right but the same as the Ceylon angel there in Jerusalem went through as in Zico's prophecy and then we find though and just so c4 saying no one believer was found there one survivor was find the same in this day when when the rapture takes place every believers going this is exactly right so will be found in the hood imarco knows who's sigh and prophets him not for the abominations done in the city for the sin that's been done you know there there's something that's got to be a part of the real Christian experience today that sin makes you sick yeah yeah absolutely that makes you sigh and cry for the sins that are being done that you know sin literally makes you sick did you say I'm not a part of this yes okay the Bible says to abhor that which is evil to hate you that which is evil and if the Holy Spirit is in us then we are going to yeah well let's see that that goes back to where that we are in our dispensation of time where that you know people are are preaching that we are just saved at sinners that we still have to sin and live in sin and we're we're sinners that were all sinners and that we are but save sinners that the grace of God just is a blanket covering over all of our sins but that's really not the way the gospel works is it that was never the New Testament teaching sure cheapens the blood of Jesus says yes and that's a bad way to describe it right and so you know this is sin you know it they it's just been given a license to sin we just we can't live above it we're going to do it anyway and jesus knows all about it but he shed his blood for us and we're saved sinners but but there should be something that changes the nature that gives a power of overcomes the new birth a new birth and what happiness religion has changed the meaning of the new birth tourists no longer I mean a new birth is a nude as a new nature is the very first doctrine Jesus teach exactly you must be born in other words your law is not going to cut it you he's talking as a Pharisee your laws not it doesn't matter how good you are you must be you must have a nature change a mess so is a seal an angel going forth today absolutely yes and I believe that this is a compound prophecy yeah I believe justice God rung down the curtain on the juice he's ringing down the curtain on the Gentiles mm-hm and I believe that history is repeating itself yeah and there is a sealing angel going through marking those who sign cry for the abominations that are done in this year and just as that there was an abomination that made Jerusalem desolate so so is there an abomination today that make a desolation that will cause massive millions of people to be thrust into tribulation just like the Jews have been for the past 2,000 years and so um we're living in a very serious hour were that we should really make her call an election soon man because we must be filled with the spirit lamps trimmed and clear right because this is the day of redemption that's right this is now the time when the Holy Spirit is lifting from the Gentiles yeah and we turn him back to the Jews again and but when it lifts and as it lifts we want to go with it I mean we want to be a part of that ascension jesus said that we should pray always that we should can escape the things that are coming on this earth and be accounted worthy to stand before the Son of Man racing and how can we be accounted worthy and that's only by the shed blood of Jesus right not just covering our sins and forgiven us of our past but changing our nature annihilate in sin in our life and sin nature and putting us in us the nature of Jesus Christ hey man hey man well god bless you today it's been really good to have this discussion together and share these things and we want you to if you have
