========================================

[Music] When the steps I take are trustful. It's hard to lean on faith when the doubt grows. When the fear of the unknown won't let me go, I will turn to hope to lead me home. I look to Jesus, he's the only way. I look to Jesus, there's power in his name. And any time I lift my eyes, I see darkness turned a light. Every shadow shows me just how much I need him. I look to Jesus. I look to Jesus. Oh, in the highest highs and the lowest lows. He's the reason why I don't walk alone. My struggles are so real, but he is true. I will trust in him to see me through. I look to Jesus. He's the only way. I look to Jesus. There's power in his power in his name. Any time I lift my eyes, I see darkness turn to light. Every shadow shows me just how much I need him. I look to Jesus. Oh, I look to Jesus. [Music] Oh, when mirales I pray for feel like they're out of reach. I know he's moving mountains, making waves in front of me. He's walked his path before me. I'll follow where he leads me. He sees everything. I look to Jesus. He's the only way. He's the only way. I look to Jesus. There's power in his name. And any time I lift my eyes, I see darkness turn to light. Every shadow shows me just how much I need him. I look to Jesus. Oh, I look to Jesus. [Music] Oh, when mirales are prayed for, feel like they're out of reach. I know he's moving mountains, making ways in front of me. He's walked his path before me. I'll follow where he leads me. He sees everything. I look to Jesus. He's the only way. He's the only way. I look to Jesus. There's power in his name. Any time I lift my eyes, I see darkness turn to light. Every shadow shows me just how much I need him. I look to Jesus. Oh, I look to Jesus. [Music] I look to Jesus. Hallelujah. [Applause]
