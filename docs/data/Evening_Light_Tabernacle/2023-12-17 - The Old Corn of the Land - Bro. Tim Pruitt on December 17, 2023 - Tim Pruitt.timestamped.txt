[1:00:55] let's turn to Joshua chap 5 and we'll
[1:00:58] read from verse 10 this morning Joshua
[1:01:01] 5: 10 I'm going to be speaking on the
[1:01:04] the old corn of the land and uh we're
[1:01:07] going to look here into the word of God
[1:01:10] today and praying that he will just
[1:01:12] speak to you in a wonderful way today
[1:01:15] and reveal himself and uh as we speak
[1:01:19] the word you know faith comes by hearing
[1:01:21] and hearing of the word of God and and
[1:01:24] that we wanting to just Place us where
[1:01:27] we are in time and what God is doing in
[1:01:31] the day and hour that we're living in
[1:01:34] and remember remember my little story
[1:01:36] that I had of going on a trip and and uh
[1:01:41] you know and and needing a map and yet
[1:01:46] as we went along on the journey there uh
[1:01:50] we got lost along the way and and uh the
[1:01:53] brother asked me said uh well brother
[1:01:55] Tim look on this map and tell us where
[1:01:57] we are and I said well no can't do it
[1:01:59] that way you have to know where you're
[1:02:01] at I said so you since you got lost go
[1:02:04] in there and ask him where are we so
[1:02:07] once we found out where we were I could
[1:02:09] find on the map and get where we were
[1:02:11] going that brother was George Hamilton
[1:02:14] you know that amen we told the story
[1:02:16] many many times God bless you brother
[1:02:18] George you have blessed many many with
[1:02:21] that little incident he says I
[1:02:22] embellished that story
[1:02:25] and I should have really told it right
[1:02:27] but um because we could you know we
[1:02:30] could have a lot of good times with that
[1:02:32] but anyway you know it took in this
[1:02:36] day God to send us a prophet we had a
[1:02:39] road map but it took us a a prophet in
[1:02:42] this day to open up the scripture and
[1:02:45] say okay here's where you come from and
[1:02:49] now here's where you're at you're way
[1:02:51] over here in the back of the book at the
[1:02:52] last Church age
[1:02:55] and where the seventh angel sounds his
[1:02:58] message and and of course and laying
[1:03:01] beyond that is the Tribulation period
[1:03:03] that thank God we're raptured and don't
[1:03:05] go through and and then finally over
[1:03:08] into the battle of Armageddon which we
[1:03:10] will be a part
[1:03:12] of we're already the
[1:03:14] winners amen it's already said in the
[1:03:17] book we win then we we're going to come
[1:03:21] come on down to to all the way to the
[1:03:23] new heaven heavens and the new Earth and
[1:03:26] my you know the word of God is so rich
[1:03:29] and so full and I'm so glad that we can
[1:03:32] be a part of that today Joshua
[1:03:35] 5:10 and the children of Israel encamped
[1:03:38] in gilgal and kept the Passover on the
[1:03:42] 14th day of the month at even in the
[1:03:46] plains of Jericho and they did eat of
[1:03:49] the old corn of the land on the tomorrow
[1:03:52] after the Sabbath
[1:03:56] uh on the tomorrow after the Passover
[1:03:58] and unleavened cakes and parts corn in
[1:04:02] the S same day and the Mana ceased on
[1:04:05] the tomorrow after they had eaten of the
[1:04:09] old corn of the land neither had the
[1:04:13] children of Israel Mana anymore but they
[1:04:16] did eat of the fruit of the land of
[1:04:20] Canaan that year God bless you as you
[1:04:23] are seated
[1:04:25] now we we have used the type of Israel's
[1:04:29] Journey as we have traveled you know
[1:04:32] from um uh all the way from Egypt to the
[1:04:37] promised land and you know and and of
[1:04:40] course that is a shadow of the church as
[1:04:45] it takes its Journey leaving Egypt and
[1:04:48] his and then of course the Wilderness
[1:04:50] Journey where the Mana is poured out we
[1:04:54] and we use this type in this way that we
[1:04:58] we have been on the journey and we have
[1:05:00] left Egypt and of course we will go to
[1:05:04] the Millennium and until the Millennium
[1:05:06] there is Mana which is a type of the
[1:05:09] Holy Ghost he would pour out the holy
[1:05:11] spirit all the way to the Millennium so
[1:05:15] if you just stop and think about it he
[1:05:17] even seals in
[1:05:19] 144,000 with the Holy Spirit after the
[1:05:23] Gentiles leave so the Holy Spirit still
[1:05:25] keeps falling uh and it ends for the
[1:05:28] Gentiles and then we'll go to the Jews
[1:05:31] so you know we have used it in that way
[1:05:33] today we're going to use the type
[1:05:36] differently and and this is one reason
[1:05:39] why that I have chosen to do the uh
[1:05:42] overhead we're going to be using the
[1:05:45] types uh we're going to be speaking
[1:05:47] about Moses and where he types in this
[1:05:50] picture um where that uh they come up to
[1:05:54] to Kadesh Baria and continued on Into
[1:05:57] the
[1:05:58] Wilderness and then and of course um but
[1:06:02] today we're going to use a type
[1:06:03] differently of the Mana or the food
[1:06:06] during the Wilderness the Mana that
[1:06:08] would only last for the day for for each
[1:06:11] age like of Luther or Wesley or
[1:06:14] Pentecost having fresh Mana every day
[1:06:17] you could not keep Luther's message over
[1:06:20] to Wesley's day because it had
[1:06:22] denominated and it it bred worms and it
[1:06:25] stank and and Mana cannot be held over
[1:06:29] unto another day so the types we're
[1:06:32] going to use today is originally the the
[1:06:37] church was like the family of Abraham so
[1:06:40] journeying in the land of promise now
[1:06:43] they didn't fully possess it um and you
[1:06:47] know they it was the promise was given
[1:06:49] they walked over it they claimed it and
[1:06:53] um and of course then they were taken
[1:06:55] down into Egypt for 400 years and so but
[1:06:59] there um the the church has been like
[1:07:03] the family of Abraham originally we were
[1:07:07] in the promised land the church was in
[1:07:10] the fullness of the word of God Amen the
[1:07:14] the Mysteries had been revealed to the
[1:07:16] Apostle Paul the truth of the word now
[1:07:19] of course the symbols and the things in
[1:07:21] the Book of Revelation that would speak
[1:07:23] in our day he did know of that but
[1:07:25] things like predestination the security
[1:07:28] of the believer or water baptism by
[1:07:31] immersion these truths that got lost
[1:07:34] down to the ages Paul understood that
[1:07:37] and brought it to the church so you know
[1:07:40] they in effect they are the old corn are
[1:07:45] the produce of the land so you see we we
[1:07:49] are coming now to where we are again R
[1:07:53] returned turning to the land eating of
[1:07:56] the old produce of the land what what
[1:07:59] the land provides what the word of God
[1:08:02] which is our Promised Land provides for
[1:08:05] us it all Lays in the word of God we
[1:08:09] we're not just having a temporary
[1:08:11] blessing of Mana coming down and and
[1:08:14] then that getting old and stinking and
[1:08:17] and and have to be renewed and refreshed
[1:08:20] and with another move of God and but no
[1:08:23] this is where we enter into the land of
[1:08:26] promise uh we into the promised land of
[1:08:30] the entire word of God and here we have
[1:08:35] every divine blessing we are like
[1:08:39] Ephesians 1 we are blessed with all
[1:08:41] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[1:08:45] in Christ Jesus so you see we just as
[1:08:51] Israel um Jacob and his family would be
[1:08:54] taken down to Egypt and and they would
[1:08:58] die down there and of course live for
[1:09:01] 400 years so the first age left its
[1:09:05] first love and it started
[1:09:08] drifting but now that there has been a
[1:09:12] journey that has been taking place
[1:09:15] actually since the
[1:09:17] reformation and the Church of course has
[1:09:20] went down to um you know is went down to
[1:09:24] Egypt at n of Rome and uh but however
[1:09:28] there's been was a Deliverance made from
[1:09:31] Egypt's bondage and so now to come out
[1:09:36] was not the promised land but they were
[1:09:40] headed toward it they were making a
[1:09:43] journey toward it and so Luther's
[1:09:46] message was a great message in that it
[1:09:49] would deliver them from the the the
[1:09:52] bonds of of Egyptian if we'd call it or
[1:09:55] Babylonian or you could call it
[1:09:58] Roman
[1:10:00] bondage where the church had been down
[1:10:03] in slavery now under popes and Bishops
[1:10:07] and ideas of man now for hundreds of
[1:10:10] years but now God was bringing an exodus
[1:10:14] out of that into the promised land and
[1:10:17] the the church would start its Journey
[1:10:20] at the
[1:10:21] Reformation beginning with Luther and
[1:10:24] and uh go back to to head toward coming
[1:10:28] closer to you know Miran are looking
[1:10:32] toward that land of Peter James John and
[1:10:37] Paul right amen so but now of course as
[1:10:42] Israel would leave the land of Egypt and
[1:10:46] start along the journey they would have
[1:10:49] camps along the road they would camp in
[1:10:52] different places the these camps would
[1:10:54] have different names that were given to
[1:10:56] them they would be camped at the springs
[1:10:59] or the Waters of Mara or they would be
[1:11:02] camped finally at kades Baria and then
[1:11:05] then on other camps in the wilderness
[1:11:08] now of course you know the camps along
[1:11:11] the road for us has been Luther and
[1:11:15] Wesley and isusa street now these are
[1:11:18] just the major camps or the major stops
[1:11:21] along the journey they are now over
[1:11:24] 40,000
[1:11:26] denominations are places where the
[1:11:29] church is camped that's now you know you
[1:11:33] you can still see the ashes of the camps
[1:11:37] you know the the Baptist ashes of
[1:11:39] Methodist ashes where the memories of
[1:11:43] you know where Luther was or Wesley was
[1:11:46] or how God moved in the ages past and so
[1:11:51] you can still find those relics and you
[1:11:56] know memorial stones or you know where
[1:11:59] where they were at and one of them's
[1:12:02] called Luther or Wesley or zeza street
[1:12:05] but now again you know you know each one
[1:12:10] of them in their
[1:12:12] time has always has every one of them
[1:12:16] have come to their own Cades
[1:12:20] Baria in other words to a judgment seat
[1:12:23] where the decision was made and where we
[1:12:27] are today is no longer journeying from
[1:12:29] one Camp to a another camp this message
[1:12:34] is not about building another
[1:12:37] denomination it is not another station
[1:12:40] along or stopping place in the desert or
[1:12:44] in the wilderness but the bride of
[1:12:46] Christ I would like to say today is no
[1:12:50] longer a Wilderness dweller they're no
[1:12:53] longer wandering in the wilderness we
[1:12:56] have arrived to the land of milk and
[1:13:00] honey we are now eating the produce of
[1:13:04] the land spoke of here as the old corn
[1:13:07] of the land it wasn't that it was old
[1:13:09] but it's what it's what Abraham ate it's
[1:13:12] what Isaac had it's what what all of
[1:13:15] them down to the the in the past had
[1:13:18] that's why they're calling it old corn
[1:13:21] you see this wasn't a part of their
[1:13:23] Wilderness diet are you with me they had
[1:13:26] mana and which was temporary blessings
[1:13:30] that was coming down and if they tried
[1:13:32] to keep it over to the next day it would
[1:13:35] breed worms and
[1:13:37] stink amen so it had to be renewed they
[1:13:40] would have to again every day get a new
[1:13:44] Supply now now I I just want to say we
[1:13:47] are no longer wandering in the
[1:13:49] wilderness but
[1:13:51] unfortunately that all who claim the
[1:13:54] message have not crossed over into this
[1:13:57] land of abundant resources they're still
[1:14:00] on the other side in camps where that
[1:14:03] they have elected leaders to take them
[1:14:06] back to
[1:14:08] Egypt in other words to have the similar
[1:14:11] bondage to have the similar things but
[1:14:15] to go back to the way it
[1:14:17] was under the spirit of Catholicism and
[1:14:20] this of course is called Nick ISM to
[1:14:24] conquer the Ley to bring them into
[1:14:27] bondage to take away from them the
[1:14:29] Glorious Freedom that belongs to us in
[1:14:34] Christ now as I said each
[1:14:38] movement has had is Cades Baria every
[1:14:42] denomination has come to its Jordan
[1:14:46] where it
[1:14:47] died refusing to go in the land and said
[1:14:51] not one of them will cross over
[1:14:55] now let's let's understand the Joshua
[1:14:59] commission and and we're we're want to
[1:15:03] look at here because we have to have a
[1:15:06] Joshua to lead us into this promised
[1:15:09] land that would be need to be a
[1:15:12] transition from the Wilderness journey
[1:15:15] to possessing the promises now so the
[1:15:19] Book of Joshua starts out Moses my
[1:15:22] servant is dead now if you if you just
[1:15:25] see here Moses and the type we we will
[1:15:28] see that it types the denominations and
[1:15:31] the ages now I know you don't like to
[1:15:34] think of that but this is the way that
[1:15:36] brother Bram typed it he said Moses
[1:15:38] coming through the Wilderness here would
[1:15:40] actually type the denominations and the
[1:15:44] ages but and the Book of Joshua starts
[1:15:47] out Moses my servant is dead now Moses
[1:15:51] would represent the law and assist
[1:15:53] system of religion that had come to its
[1:15:56] Jordan and it had led them right up to
[1:16:00] the Border but it could not take them
[1:16:04] over remember this no denomination or a
[1:16:07] man-made system can ever take you over
[1:16:11] into the full promise only the
[1:16:14] supernatural workings of almighty God
[1:16:16] can do
[1:16:17] that
[1:16:19] amen now so you see um so now we're
[1:16:24] going to we're going to speak about
[1:16:25] Joshua in the type here in a moment but
[1:16:28] brother bradam says about him he said
[1:16:30] how Joshua must have felt standing that
[1:16:33] morning talk to God I will not fail thee
[1:16:37] that as I was with Moses so will I be
[1:16:40] with you in other words as I I blessed
[1:16:44] them leaving the bondage of
[1:16:47] denominationalism and and starting out
[1:16:50] you know on the journey toward the
[1:16:52] Promised Land and the miraculous things
[1:16:54] that I did so will I be with you as I
[1:16:58] was with Moses I'll be with you no man
[1:17:00] shall stand before you all the days of
[1:17:01] your life he said I want to make that
[1:17:03] way clear only be strong and courageous
[1:17:07] don't be afraid I'm with you and I'll
[1:17:09] see you through what a commission this
[1:17:12] was given to the new man called Joshua
[1:17:16] so there's been lots of types here we
[1:17:18] could go into but he said we can we'll
[1:17:21] bypass some of them for instance MOS was
[1:17:23] like the church age that brought them to
[1:17:26] SI to their Theology of last night Moses
[1:17:30] was not permitted to take the children
[1:17:33] of Israel over into the promised land
[1:17:37] because he had
[1:17:40] failed now again he continues to explain
[1:17:44] and the church organizations and
[1:17:47] denominations has failed they will not
[1:17:51] take the church over God God will raise
[1:17:53] up a new system an inter denominational
[1:17:56] system in other words not you know a a a
[1:18:00] a Believers made up of all walks of life
[1:18:05] Baptist Methodist Presbyterian catholic
[1:18:08] whatever coming you know many times
[1:18:10] people are saying oh that we could just
[1:18:12] have that Unity brother brandom talked
[1:18:14] about well if you look out here this
[1:18:16] morning you will see Baptist and
[1:18:19] Methodist and Pentecostals and Catholic
[1:18:21] all worshiping in the same building
[1:18:24] under the unity of the spirit the very
[1:18:28] thing that he desired to see is happen
[1:18:31] because we heard a voice that said come
[1:18:34] out of her my people and we have all
[1:18:38] entered into this Promised Land yes sir
[1:18:41] Hallelujah so you see and and again so
[1:18:45] he said it would it'll tell God would
[1:18:47] raise up a new system in denominational
[1:18:50] system by the power of God that it take
[1:18:52] the church into the promised land now
[1:18:55] Moses had failed and he was a lawgiver
[1:18:59] Joshua was called a Grace and he took
[1:19:02] the church over Moses failed he could
[1:19:05] not take them over this is something
[1:19:09] brother Brandon would hammer over and
[1:19:11] over again that that it would be
[1:19:15] impossible for them to take it over just
[1:19:17] a minute let me just look at my slides
[1:19:19] just a minute let me see where we're at
[1:19:21] here I want to just I just want to see
[1:19:27] um where where we're at
[1:19:30] here
[1:19:33] okay I didn't quite get all the the
[1:19:35] quotes that I wanted in here but
[1:19:37] nevertheless we will paraphrase them as
[1:19:39] we go along so now again as we as we
[1:19:44] look at this the J the Book of Joshua he
[1:19:48] said was the Ephesians of the Old
[1:19:51] Testament now let's look at it
[1:19:53] like this you know Joshua was the book
[1:19:57] in the Bible where God placed the people
[1:20:01] into their inheritance where they took
[1:20:03] over their land of promise the book of
[1:20:06] Ephesians for the New Testament is the
[1:20:09] book like Joshua that places us in our
[1:20:15] inheritance what what is it do it begins
[1:20:18] that you were chosen in him before the
[1:20:21] foundation of the world what's he doing
[1:20:23] he's placing you as to where your origin
[1:20:27] is so that you would know your destiny
[1:20:30] yes sir are you with me you knew you
[1:20:32] came from God and you're going back to
[1:20:35] God no matter what's in between here and
[1:20:38] there that doesn't matter no matter how
[1:20:41] many Falls and bumbles and mistakes you
[1:20:43] make along the way it doesn't matter
[1:20:47] what matters is you were there and his
[1:20:49] thinking there and he's already seen
[1:20:52] your D Destiny your destiny has been set
[1:20:56] to complete adoption of sons by Jesus
[1:20:59] Christ in other words recognition that
[1:21:02] you're a child of God that you are an
[1:21:05] heir to the promises of God so therefore
[1:21:08] he has blessed you with all spiritual
[1:21:11] blessings in Heavenly
[1:21:13] places in Christ Jesus you are a blessed
[1:21:19] people in this land
[1:21:23] so again you see the Joshua of the Old
[1:21:26] Testament was the Ephesians of the of is
[1:21:30] if like the Ephesians of the new it's a
[1:21:32] a book of redemption so he says again
[1:21:36] that book of Ephesians of the Old
[1:21:39] Testament Joshua where Moses represented
[1:21:42] the law could save no one but Grace
[1:21:44] could and Joshua is here the same word
[1:21:48] like Jesus Jehovah savior now we find
[1:21:50] out when we come to another another
[1:21:52] other Ephesians where that in that our
[1:21:55] intellectual denominations and so forth
[1:21:58] all our educational program has come to
[1:22:02] its Jordan and then we must have an
[1:22:06] Ephesians again you see this is what
[1:22:09] brother Brandon was was telling us that
[1:22:12] that all systems of man have come to his
[1:22:18] Jordan you know it it has come to his
[1:22:21] time of death and and and there if they
[1:22:23] wouldn't go in the land they went back
[1:22:25] into
[1:22:26] wanderings you know we we passed many
[1:22:30] churches on our way to church today and
[1:22:33] and I I just say God bless them all you
[1:22:36] know I I I don't want in my heart to
[1:22:38] criticize any of them or look down my
[1:22:41] nose at them and I don't want you to you
[1:22:44] know they're struggling wanding around
[1:22:47] the Wilderness many of them circling
[1:22:49] around the same mountain of doctrines
[1:22:52] over and over and over
[1:22:54] again because
[1:22:57] somebody somebody in the in the where
[1:23:00] God was moving at that time they came to
[1:23:02] their Cades and refused to go
[1:23:05] in but even then there may be a Joshua
[1:23:08] or a Caleb among them that God will pull
[1:23:12] out and take them
[1:23:14] [Applause]
[1:23:15] in so we don't throw out criticism at it
[1:23:19] there's many many many that are like
[1:23:21] that and God have mercy upon them
[1:23:23] because and may there be life for them
[1:23:25] in the in the Great Tribulation or
[1:23:27] wherever you know at the white judgment
[1:23:30] Throne judgment to come that's not
[1:23:32] that's not for me to decide what my
[1:23:35] decision is what I'm decide is I must I
[1:23:40] must take my
[1:23:44] inheritance you can't just look at the
[1:23:46] them and thou and them those and what
[1:23:49] them and look at them and them what
[1:23:50] about you that's
[1:23:53] are you possessing everything that God
[1:23:55] said for
[1:23:56] you you see so he would tell us in the
[1:24:00] breach between the seals he said that
[1:24:04] that this book this this seven sealed
[1:24:08] book this book of redemption which is
[1:24:10] the Bible is not revealed until the
[1:24:13] church ages and denominational ages has
[1:24:15] run
[1:24:17] out and there's no more time it's
[1:24:20] revealed after the Church ages and
[1:24:23] denominational ages has run out in other
[1:24:26] words we we have run out of Ages we've
[1:24:28] come one two three four five six S no
[1:24:34] more ages ages are over Church ages are
[1:24:37] done we're here at the very end before
[1:24:40] the Rapture we're standing right here as
[1:24:43] the Overcomers to be caught up before
[1:24:45] him in the throne and experience
[1:24:48] Revelation 41 and I heard a trumpet
[1:24:51] likee voice from Heaven saying come up
[1:24:54] hither that's what the trumpet says if
[1:24:58] you want to know when the trumpet sounds
[1:25:00] it's going to say something what it is
[1:25:02] it is the call to come up here to leave
[1:25:06] the Earth to leave the the world of sin
[1:25:10] that you're in and be caught up and that
[1:25:12] happens right at the close of the leoan
[1:25:17] age and we have arrived yes I can point
[1:25:21] on the map and say here we are not by my
[1:25:25] authority a prophet told
[1:25:29] me amen now but he said but that's the
[1:25:33] reason that things in such a scruple
[1:25:36] tonight he said they pick up a little
[1:25:39] doctor and they run off on this side and
[1:25:40] say this is it and another picks up
[1:25:43] another doctor and runs off this side
[1:25:45] say this is it and each one builds a
[1:25:48] denomination under until we got hundreds
[1:25:50] of denomination but still it's all all
[1:25:52] all of it to see the confusion the
[1:25:55] people are wondering what is the
[1:25:57] truth and and that's it if you went on
[1:26:00] the quest today how are you going to
[1:26:02] find
[1:26:04] truth there's 40,000
[1:26:08] denominations and by the time you sort
[1:26:10] through all of them your lifetime is
[1:26:13] over visiting that one go here you know
[1:26:17] studying this one how how are you going
[1:26:19] to
[1:26:21] know this this is why God vindicates a
[1:26:26] message to show you with so you will not
[1:26:30] have a
[1:26:31] doubt amen that this is my voice this is
[1:26:35] my servant this is my
[1:26:41] way
[1:26:44] now what is the ti why is the type of
[1:26:47] Joshua entering in the land and
[1:26:51] possessing divided an inheritance why is
[1:26:53] that so important to us why are we even
[1:26:56] looking at that because it is a prophecy
[1:27:01] of our day and represents our message
[1:27:05] now stop for a minute remember remember
[1:27:07] I I try to bring it to you over and over
[1:27:10] again that which is that which has been
[1:27:12] done in the Bible every character of The
[1:27:14] Bible all down to the scripture is a
[1:27:18] shadow there's something that is coming
[1:27:21] and as it approaches it makes a
[1:27:25] shadow so just like you see the Shadow
[1:27:28] on my Bible you know it shows that there
[1:27:31] is something that is approaching and
[1:27:34] it's making a shadow and the the closer
[1:27:38] it comes the more defined the shadow is
[1:27:42] if you'll look right here you know you
[1:27:44] can look and sometimes it looks like
[1:27:46] there's actually two or three shadows
[1:27:48] right there and this is where people get
[1:27:51] two or three three Gods because in the
[1:27:54] shadow is not
[1:27:58] plain amen but when the word comes and
[1:28:03] as it the more it approaches the clearer
[1:28:06] and the more defined that it
[1:28:09] gets until the two the two becomes
[1:28:16] one and I want you to know that we are
[1:28:19] not typing another generation to come we
[1:28:24] are the positive of those negatives they
[1:28:28] were prophesying of us we are not
[1:28:32] prophesying of another age but we are
[1:28:35] the age of the Fulfillment of all
[1:28:42] prophecies so the prophecy of our day of
[1:28:45] course would be found in the scripture
[1:28:47] this is why we're looking at the at
[1:28:50] Joshua because brother brandham said you
[1:28:52] know it's the Ephesians of the Old
[1:28:55] Testament it's the placing in the land
[1:28:58] and if you go look and see what God did
[1:29:00] you'll get an idea of what he's doing
[1:29:03] now
[1:29:05] now as we as we look it is a prophecy
[1:29:10] because we too have returned to the land
[1:29:13] of our
[1:29:16] fathers after the church so Journey Down
[1:29:19] in
[1:29:20] Egypt learning Egyptian ways getting
[1:29:25] confused on
[1:29:26] deity having a trinity
[1:29:29] baptism having everything scrup and
[1:29:32] messed
[1:29:33] up and God has been bringing us on a
[1:29:36] journey the church on a journey to the
[1:29:39] promised land to the land of full
[1:29:43] inheritance it is the land of the New
[1:29:45] Covenant of Jesus Peter James John and
[1:29:49] Paul it is it is the land of the
[1:29:52] prophets of Elijah Isaiah Ezekiel the
[1:29:56] land of the Patriarchs of Abraham Isaac
[1:29:59] and Jacob it is our
[1:30:02] land you know this is where Israel is
[1:30:05] today there they they go over there and
[1:30:07] they dig up at Shiloh and and they find
[1:30:09] it the the ancient names of of the the
[1:30:13] place and ancient names of the people
[1:30:16] that was there and little Clues here and
[1:30:18] little Clues there Philistines can't do
[1:30:21] that pales Ians can't do that do do you
[1:30:24] hear what I'm saying all the Arabs can't
[1:30:27] do that only the Jews can do
[1:30:30] that right because that's their
[1:30:34] forefathers this was their land predated
[1:30:38] before any of them and I I want to say
[1:30:42] this that this was our line before the
[1:30:45] Catholics messed it
[1:30:47] up before the Baptists the Presbyterians
[1:30:50] the others made made a mess out of
[1:30:52] things come on Amen this was our land
[1:30:56] first and we have returned to the land
[1:30:59] of the
[1:31:01] Bible Amen to where every Divine promise
[1:31:05] of God that lays in the Land Is
[1:31:08] Ours where that we are fulfilling every
[1:31:11] type that spoke of the
[1:31:15] Bride now so now as we're looking at
[1:31:18] this we're we're going to we've talked
[1:31:22] about Moses and the type now he does he
[1:31:25] does not type and I want to get this
[1:31:28] clear he does not in this in in this way
[1:31:31] at all type brother brandom he is typing
[1:31:34] the denominational system I just read
[1:31:37] you quotes I intended to have them up
[1:31:39] but I didn't get them so I read them to
[1:31:41] you but nevertheless as we look here Al
[1:31:44] also in Joshua about Joshua Joshua will
[1:31:49] type the end time leader to take us into
[1:31:53] the promised land I'll read this quote
[1:31:56] again another time it might be a little
[1:31:58] redundant on it but let me just say you
[1:32:00] know here in this in this instance where
[1:32:05] where that Joshua and the type brother
[1:32:08] brandham as you know he would receive
[1:32:11] the a hand come down out of heaven and
[1:32:14] I'll go into more details in that I saw
[1:32:17] the Bible in hand come come down in the
[1:32:20] room and St where I at a hand from above
[1:32:24] came down and parted the
[1:32:27] pages and turned them out and come
[1:32:31] slowly to Joshua 1 to the 9th
[1:32:36] verse and stop going down slowly so he
[1:32:39] would actually the hand would come down
[1:32:43] out of heaven and point to brother
[1:32:45] branam his
[1:32:48] commission now remember I want you to
[1:32:51] say say it types the end time leader
[1:32:54] that will take us into the promised land
[1:32:58] now
[1:33:00] so again Joshua in the
[1:33:04] type it it it shows that in Joshua in
[1:33:08] the Hebrew means savior it represents
[1:33:10] the promis Endtime leader to take the
[1:33:12] church over Caleb represents the True
[1:33:17] Believer who stayed with Joshua remember
[1:33:20] not just Joshua took the land but there
[1:33:22] was also the some
[1:33:24] calebs amen a Caleb that also stood with
[1:33:28] him and said we can do it amen so every
[1:33:31] person has to have their kades Baria
[1:33:34] moment and go and say we can take this
[1:33:37] land This Is Our Land now again Joshua
[1:33:42] means Jehovah's Savior and he represents
[1:33:44] the end time leader that will come to
[1:33:46] the church even as Paul came as the
[1:33:49] original leader and Caleb rep represents
[1:33:52] Caleb represents that
[1:33:55] now so here again Joshua is not brother
[1:33:59] Brandon you say well but you just said
[1:34:02] he was no he's the end time leader that
[1:34:07] uses a
[1:34:11] man stop just for a moment it was not it
[1:34:15] was not Joshua who won the Battle of
[1:34:20] Jericho
[1:34:22] there was the Lord
[1:34:24] himself came
[1:34:26] down sword in his hands and said this is
[1:34:30] my battle that's right and I'm in charge
[1:34:33] I'm the captain I am the leader I want
[1:34:37] you to understand this this we are not
[1:34:40] following a man and his message we are
[1:34:44] following God and his
[1:34:48] message but he happens to use a man I'm
[1:34:51] going to do a work in that day and
[1:34:53] you'll no wise believe it because a man
[1:34:55] will bring it so man you know have that
[1:34:59] trouble you know of of accepting but
[1:35:01] Joshua is the holy spirit that would
[1:35:04] lead the church through his servant the
[1:35:07] prophet the one in charge is the Lord
[1:35:11] Jesus
[1:35:14] Christ Hallelujah he stands with his
[1:35:17] sword drawn Furnishing the battle plans
[1:35:20] to remove move every devil off of the
[1:35:24] land of
[1:35:26] promis come on I want to just say today
[1:35:30] he's still in
[1:35:31] charge he's still with us even
[1:35:34] now amen he's still the mighty Jehovah
[1:35:38] with his sword drawn to chase every
[1:35:41] devil off your land to give you the
[1:35:42] battle plan of how to defeat your enemy

[1:35:48] is I don't care what kind of unbelief it
[1:35:51] is is I don't care what kind of cancer
[1:35:53] or disease or what he is in charge and
[1:35:58] he is leading the battle he knows how to
[1:36:00] defeat the enemy and he knows exactly
[1:36:03] the
[1:36:04] [Applause]
[1:36:05] time and sometimes he'll just tell you
[1:36:08] to March around in silence till I tell
[1:36:10] you to shout the
[1:36:13] victory but whatever it is don't murmur
[1:36:16] and complain and fuss and wonder and
[1:36:18] Ponder and say well God ain't doing
[1:36:21] nothing yes he is just keep marching
[1:36:24] like he
[1:36:26] said now let's remember why
[1:36:30] Joshua was
[1:36:32] chosen Moses had
[1:36:34] died Moses represented the law in the
[1:36:38] wilderness Journey he represents the
[1:36:39] many camps along the journey as I said
[1:36:43] 40,000
[1:36:45] denominations God had used him he done
[1:36:48] marvelous
[1:36:50] things
[1:36:52] great
[1:36:53] things as he says in Israel in the
[1:36:56] church that Martin Luther saw the pillar
[1:37:00] of fire move and when he came out of the
[1:37:02] Catholic church he followed the pillar
[1:37:04] of fire and he brought 10, thousands of
[1:37:07] them out and then Martin Luther built
[1:37:10] under that Pillar of Fire and when he
[1:37:12] got down there first thing he made he
[1:37:13] made a a great organization in other
[1:37:16] words a camp they Camp there called the
[1:37:19] Lutheran Church both one day the pillar
[1:37:22] of fire began to move again but Martin
[1:37:26] Luther couldn't move because he was
[1:37:29] organized he had to stay there that's
[1:37:31] right and a little fell into England by
[1:37:33] the name of John Wesley and saw it and
[1:37:35] Martin Luther said the just shall live
[1:37:37] by faith and now John Wesley said that
[1:37:40] Jesus suffered within the out the gates
[1:37:42] that he might sanctify the people with
[1:37:44] his own blood he seen sanctification the
[1:37:46] pillar of fire moved on but Luther
[1:37:48] couldn't move because he was organized
[1:37:53] and then he goes on to say they then
[1:37:56] they couldn't move so John Wesley saw
[1:37:58] the pillar of fire and he moved after it
[1:38:00] he saved the Nation about three or four
[1:38:01] nations was in moral Decay and John
[1:38:03] Wesley saw the pillar of fire and
[1:38:06] started the Wesley Revival that swept
[1:38:08] around the world and come out here him
[1:38:10] and Asbury and them and save the day and
[1:38:13] then the first thing you know John
[1:38:14] Wesley organized so tight the pillar of
[1:38:17] fire began to move
[1:38:20] again and and
[1:38:23] um and Wesley couldn't move because he
[1:38:26] was organized and the Pentecostal people
[1:38:28] saw it and away they went that's right
[1:38:31] it left Wesley sitting in the shade and
[1:38:33] God laid him on the Shelf with Luther
[1:38:36] all right now the first thing you know
[1:38:38] they had a great Revival a Pentecost
[1:38:40] Revival restoration of the gifts and so
[1:38:43] forth and the first thing you know the
[1:38:45] pillar of fire has began to move again
[1:38:47] but Pentecost is so
[1:38:49] organized it can't go brother that hurt
[1:38:52] didn't it that's good it's so organized
[1:38:54] crystallized so it can't go that's right
[1:38:57] that's true but the pillar of fire is
[1:38:59] moving out brother and there's people
[1:39:02] that's going with it Hallelujah we are
[1:39:05] bound for the promised
[1:39:09] land so you see at cadus Baria they were
[1:39:12] to go up and take the land but they
[1:39:14] didn't they said they were unable and
[1:39:16] they brought back an evil report of the
[1:39:20] land
[1:39:21] you know what they said let's bring it
[1:39:24] modernize it a little bit they said it
[1:39:26] was only for God's
[1:39:30] Prophet it was only for his
[1:39:33] days you know it was only to vindicate
[1:39:38] him that John 14:12 was only for him to
[1:39:43] fulfill that prayer lines were for days
[1:39:47] past this is the evil
[1:39:49] report that tongues and other gifts of
[1:39:52] the Spirit was only for Spiritual babies
[1:39:54] and the immature that all spiritual
[1:39:57] gifts were on the
[1:39:59] shelf that that which is perfect had
[1:40:01] come and everything else is done away
[1:40:03] with that we don't receive the Holy
[1:40:06] Ghost as it did on the day of Pentecost
[1:40:07] that we Gentiles just believe the word
[1:40:10] that we called the Holy Ghost just
[1:40:14] fleshly
[1:40:16] emotions and evil
[1:40:19] report notice this as we go in there
[1:40:24] this this is what happened that the
[1:40:27] Bible said that in the Book of Numbers
[1:40:30] remember when they left Kadesh and
[1:40:34] started their
[1:40:35] wandering that immediately they got to
[1:40:39] thirsting and they spake against God and
[1:40:42] Moses and said wherefore have you
[1:40:44] brought us up out of this Egypt to die
[1:40:47] in the wilderness for there is no bread
[1:40:50] neither there is in water and our soul
[1:40:52] Lo is is like bread even the revelations
[1:40:56] and the truths that they had received
[1:40:59] now
[1:40:59] [Music]
[1:41:01] become
[1:41:05] disdained and the Lord sent fiery
[1:41:09] serpents among them and they bit the
[1:41:12] people and much of the people
[1:41:17] died and this made for had church
[1:41:23] members don't hang up on me this is what
[1:41:27] happened this made they they you know
[1:41:30] God was sending Mana but they complained
[1:41:33] about that so God sent them fiery
[1:41:36] serpents and they were bit of them and
[1:41:38] this made dead church members for
[1:41:41] instead of God sending the fire of the
[1:41:43] outpouring of the Holy Spirit he let
[1:41:45] them suffer the fire of
[1:41:48] serpents and now they were bitten and
[1:41:51] they die they become mortified on the
[1:41:55] Pew
[1:41:57] crystallized
[1:42:00] dead amen sermons become dead church
[1:42:04] members become dead dead sermons you
[1:42:08] know make for dead
[1:42:10] people dead sermons
[1:42:12] kill are you with me this made for
[1:42:15] denominational Pew waren and Christians
[1:42:18] who lusted for the leaks and garlics
[1:42:22] wanting the flavor of
[1:42:25] Education every denomination made their
[1:42:28] schools and Seminary to educate their
[1:42:30] Ministry in culinary skills to flavor
[1:42:34] the food served in their
[1:42:40] churches
[1:42:42] well let me just quote some of the
[1:42:45] flavor well the Bible's not to be taken
[1:42:48] literally some Miracles were explained
[1:42:51] way Moses really didn't cross through
[1:42:53] the Red Sea but through a sea of
[1:42:58] reeds before long the miraculous was
[1:43:00] explained way so flavored with Egypt's
[1:43:03] garlic until not even the Virgin birth
[1:43:06] was
[1:43:08] believed see even even some some years
[1:43:11] ago brother Bram talks about it and it's
[1:43:13] true that the Methodist wanted anything
[1:43:15] about the blood taken out of their song
[1:43:19] books cuz they didn't want no bloody
[1:43:21] gory
[1:43:23] religion you know
[1:43:26] some and and you got where church
[1:43:28] members out many of them will not even
[1:43:30] believe in the Virgin
[1:43:34] birth and even I'm going to bring it now
[1:43:36] this is a little bit hard but some
[1:43:38] within the message Community now
[1:43:41] minimize the Corporal physical return of
[1:43:47] Christ saying he's already came when the
[1:43:49] word was open
[1:43:51] and of course he did he came in the form
[1:43:53] of the word but there's still a Corporal
[1:43:55] coming that's right are you with me amen
[1:43:58] so again others deny the working of
[1:44:00] Miracles and gifts of the Spirit and say
[1:44:02] that were only for the apostles or or
[1:44:05] the prophet to vindicate the New
[1:44:07] Testament that's what they would say in
[1:44:08] denomination they say it in the message
[1:44:10] community that was only now for the
[1:44:13] prophet and you know that which is
[1:44:14] perfect is come we have perfect word and
[1:44:17] So speaking in tongues is done away with
[1:44:19] that's not what the prophet
[1:44:21] said the prophet said now we do have
[1:44:24] today by by Divine Vindication the the
[1:44:29] perfect interpretation of the word of
[1:44:32] God so jumping up and down like a kid
[1:44:35] and trying to speak with tongues is
[1:44:41] over so trying to speak with tongues
[1:44:44] getting somebody down the Altar and
[1:44:46] jiggle their chin up and down and
[1:44:48] manufacture a gift that's over
[1:44:51] but tongues can't be over that's Bible
[1:44:55] That's Right a prophet could not even
[1:44:57] dismiss it and say it's no more
[1:45:01] applicable it's the Bible Paul said I I
[1:45:04] would did you all spoke in tongues
[1:45:05] rather but rather that you
[1:45:10] prophesied so the fiery serpents there
[1:45:13] among many remove the gifts of the
[1:45:16] Spirit and and and and tries to with the
[1:45:20] bites bring that poison in you see every
[1:45:24] generation comes to his cadesh Baria I
[1:45:29] can bring out quotes to you where
[1:45:30] brother brandham would say brandham
[1:45:32] Tabernacle you are at kades barnea
[1:45:35] Pentecost you are at kades Baria you
[1:45:38] know again in every every age every time
[1:45:43] has their own Revival every move has its
[1:45:46] own chance at the word and so everyone
[1:45:49] will come to their Cades Baria and
[1:45:52] say
[1:45:55] well we just can't take it it ain't the
[1:45:59] season it's not the right time we this
[1:46:02] ain't for us and they'll go back into
[1:46:05] wandering every generation has the
[1:46:08] opportunity to go into the fullness of
[1:46:10] the word you have it this
[1:46:13] morning every person sitting on your
[1:46:16] this Pew today are in in it's your own
[1:46:19] right hasn't had to have your Cades
[1:46:21] Baria
[1:46:23] moment amen the lutherans came out of
[1:46:25] the Catholic Move whose Mana had bred
[1:46:28] worms and stank and and they the
[1:46:31] Catholics that stood at Cades and were
[1:46:34] refused they were offered to taste the
[1:46:37] the taste of justification and refus to
[1:46:40] go on and they fulfill the scripture let
[1:46:43] me see if I have the scripture
[1:46:45] up excuse me here just a
[1:46:49] minute
[1:46:55] all right so Hebrews 6 which it says for
[1:47:00] it is impossible here they fulfill this
[1:47:03] scripture it is impossible for those who
[1:47:06] were once enlightened tasted of the
[1:47:09] Heavenly gift Catholics would taste of
[1:47:12] justification you don't have to be saved
[1:47:14] by crawling on your hands and knees
[1:47:17] doing
[1:47:18] Penance you can be Justified and
[1:47:21] forgiven by
[1:47:22] Faith No More do you have to B buy a
[1:47:25] candle and burn for for a loved one
[1:47:28] they're forgiven by
[1:47:30] Grace but you see that would come to
[1:47:33] that Cades moment and refuse to go in
[1:47:36] and they would die in the
[1:47:40] wilderness now again he said and they
[1:47:43] have tasted of the good word of God and
[1:47:45] the powers of the world will come if
[1:47:47] they shall fall away to renew them to
[1:47:49] repent to see and they crucify the Son
[1:47:52] of God of fresh and put him to an open
[1:47:54] shame and every movement down there
[1:47:57] there can be no Revival you will not be
[1:48:00] a Revival Catholic Methodist Baptist
[1:48:03] none of them none of them will have a
[1:48:06] Revival the only Revival that there will
[1:48:10] be is a bride's
[1:48:12] Revival and we're in
[1:48:14] it we're a part of it and it didn't
[1:48:17] start at evening like Tabernacle it
[1:48:19] started because the lamb took the book
[1:48:21] and opened up the Seven Seals revealing
[1:48:24] the mysteries of God that started the
[1:48:27] bride's Revival now so the Lutheran came
[1:48:30] to Kadesh Baria when when Wesley brought
[1:48:33] the fruit of sanctification and offered
[1:48:36] it to them to taste and they stayed with
[1:48:38] their organizational system saying well
[1:48:41] we've received from Heaven this mana and
[1:48:42] it was Mana from heaven but they had
[1:48:45] kept it over for another day and it
[1:48:48] stank and bread w worms Wesley with his
[1:48:52] sanctification movement went forward but
[1:48:55] they also came to their Cades refusing
[1:48:57] speaking in tongues and they also
[1:49:00] fulfilled the same scripture it's
[1:49:02] impossible to renew
[1:49:04] yourselves because they refused speaking
[1:49:07] in tongues and the outpouring of the
[1:49:08] Holy Spirit at ausa street so they also
[1:49:12] fulfilled Hebrews 6 and
[1:49:14] 4 and then lusus Street got the taste of
[1:49:17] the powers of the world to come standing
[1:49:19] at their Cades and refused to go over
[1:49:23] once again you see once again it was
[1:49:27] here here there was at cadesh and they
[1:49:30] turned back in the wilderness and what's
[1:49:33] now they will go out there and they will
[1:49:35] get
[1:49:36] thirsty and Moses will Smite The
[1:49:40] Rock to try to bring them some new
[1:49:44] thing remember the original atonement is
[1:49:49] to where was where The Rock was
[1:49:52] smitten that was 2,000 years ago at
[1:49:56] Calvary you do not have to Smite The
[1:49:58] Rock again you speak to the Rock it's
[1:50:02] already been smitten but you see every
[1:50:06] movement comes along and it's another
[1:50:08] smiting of the rock bringing trying to
[1:50:11] bring something new out of
[1:50:14] Christ trying to bring a new doctrine
[1:50:18] trying to bring a new teaching starting
[1:50:20] a new system of organization another man
[1:50:23] as a
[1:50:25] leader so lack of water at kades caused
[1:50:28] Moses to Smite The Rock and there was
[1:50:32] plenty of water in the promised land but
[1:50:33] they refused to go
[1:50:36] over did you hear what I said if they'
[1:50:39] have went in the promised land there was
[1:50:41] plenty of
[1:50:43] water there was streams and rivers and
[1:50:48] abundance m land flowing of milk and
[1:50:51] honey but in the
[1:50:53] wilderness they get thirsty
[1:50:56] again now it's in the wilderness that
[1:51:01] Moses glorifies himself and this is the
[1:51:04] problem you see those movements have men
[1:51:08] as their leaders and what they do is
[1:51:10] glorify
[1:51:11] themselves look who we are we're the
[1:51:14] great church and they Smite The Rock
[1:51:18] trying to bring out l
[1:51:21] to the people and it's not Abundant Life
[1:51:25] come on no it's not AB the Abundant Life
[1:51:28] lays in the promised land flowing with
[1:51:30] milk and honey this is Desert out
[1:51:34] here now so Moses brother brandom tells
[1:51:37] us a message of Grace he said Moses that
[1:51:39] great leader God should have killed him
[1:51:42] when he went down there to glorify
[1:51:44] himself by smiting The Rock and he said
[1:51:46] you see what I can do in other words you
[1:51:49] rebels must we fetch you water from this
[1:51:52] rock and he smoted it and the waters
[1:51:54] didn't come and he smoted it again what
[1:51:57] did he do he testified of the weakness
[1:51:59] of Christ because Christ was that rock
[1:52:01] that's a headstone instead of speaking
[1:52:04] to it it was smitten once that's when it
[1:52:07] was to be remember God told Moses over
[1:52:10] in Exodus go and I'll Stand before you
[1:52:12] before the rock Smite The Rock and then
[1:52:15] he smoked the Rock and it brought forth
[1:52:16] Waters the next time you go speak the
[1:52:18] rock it'll bring forth those Waters but
[1:52:20] Moses wanted to show he had a little
[1:52:23] authority a little power and he said
[1:52:26] I'll bring you water out of this rock
[1:52:29] and God should have killed him for it
[1:52:31] God should have separated him there he
[1:52:34] broke God's law there because he spoke
[1:52:36] of the weakness of Christ he had to be
[1:52:39] has to be smitten the second time Christ
[1:52:41] was only smitten once now we speak the
[1:52:43] Rock and it bring forth this water so in
[1:52:46] the ever presentes water from the Rock
[1:52:48] brother bandam talks about this how that
[1:52:50] then when they wandered off the path
[1:52:52] when they refused to go in at cadus
[1:52:55] barnea you know that and they got into
[1:52:58] ISM and adopted things like Apostles
[1:53:00] Creed and and catechism and and
[1:53:03] denominations instead of experience and
[1:53:06] shaking hands instead of a born again
[1:53:09] experience adopted sprinkling instead of
[1:53:12] water baptism they adopted an evil form
[1:53:15] of Father Son and Holy Ghost when
[1:53:16] there's no such a thing in the Bible the
[1:53:18] Bible said in the name name of Jesus
[1:53:20] Christ there's only one thing to do if
[1:53:22] you want to if you want that same water
[1:53:24] is come back to the path
[1:53:27] again now so he goes on to tell he said
[1:53:30] you take the Creeds in the stead of
[1:53:32] Christ you wander off in Tantrums one
[1:53:35] said I'm a Methodist the other said I'm
[1:53:37] a Baptist that shows you're not a
[1:53:39] Christian then we are Christ we belong
[1:53:41] to him well if me a Baptist it's all
[1:53:44] right if that's all you are then you're
[1:53:46] none of Christ you're a Baptist well I'm
[1:53:48] Pentecostal if you're just Pentecostal
[1:53:50] by denomination that's all you are but
[1:53:53] if you got the Pentecostal experience
[1:53:55] and the Pentecostal word will bring for
[1:53:58] the Pentecostal experience follow the
[1:54:00] same thing those disciples did stay
[1:54:02] there till you get filled with the Holy
[1:54:04] Ghost and then if you if that you get
[1:54:08] contrary to the word that spirit in you
[1:54:09] goes contrary to what the word said then
[1:54:11] it isn't the holy spirit it's the devil
[1:54:14] impersonating the holy
[1:54:17] spirit so he continues on and he said
[1:54:20] Christ was to be smitten once and he
[1:54:23] said he smoted him now the second time
[1:54:25] and he said Moses was setting up
[1:54:28] something
[1:54:29] new trying to make a new thing and
[1:54:34] that's the way our clergymen have done
[1:54:37] they tried to make something new and
[1:54:39] we'll make ourselves the Assembly of God
[1:54:41] we'll make ourselves the Pentecostal
[1:54:43] Church of God we'll make oursel the
[1:54:45] general counsel we'll make oursel this
[1:54:46] that or the other that's not what God
[1:54:48] did that was not his idea now if you
[1:54:51] bring it bring that forward what have we
[1:54:54] done many the message Community came to
[1:54:57] its on Cades Maria and we make ourselves
[1:55:00] tape only our Coleman's Thunders our
[1:55:04] veils perua or two Lord you know what it
[1:55:07] is it's smiting The Rock again it will
[1:55:10] water a thirst and people but it doesn't
[1:55:13] bring them into the promised land people
[1:55:16] get excited and have a little Revival
[1:55:19] over this new doctrine but he don't
[1:55:22] bring them into the fullness of the
[1:55:24] promise they're still in the
[1:55:28] wilderness you see Christ was to be
[1:55:30] smitten once that's the original
[1:55:33] experience
[1:55:35] amen and and and every everyone must
[1:55:38] have that experience that's the original
[1:55:40] way Peter said on the day of Pentecost
[1:55:43] repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:55:45] in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:55:47] remission of sin and we'll spray we
[1:55:49] sprinkle Father Son and Holy Ghost and
[1:55:51] give all kinds of Creeds and whatever
[1:55:53] when we get off the word you know that's
[1:55:55] what happens you wind up in wanderings
[1:55:58] and the same thing has happened in the
[1:56:00] message
[1:56:01] Community you see God is trying to bring
[1:56:04] us to place where where that we we are
[1:56:07] in the land of promise and subject to
[1:56:10] everything that is
[1:56:12] there you see that but he said they're
[1:56:14] smiting The Rock again to start
[1:56:16] something new we don't need a new doctor
[1:56:21] and the last thing the message Community
[1:56:23] needs is another man to raise up that
[1:56:27] knows it all going to be the Joshua to
[1:56:30] lead us in and really it's just a
[1:56:32] captain to take you back to Egypt again
[1:56:35] we've already had the Joshua that's and
[1:56:39] by now you should have crossed over into
[1:56:41] the land yes sir and if you're not there
[1:56:44] the opportunity is still there the
[1:56:46] stragglers there they can still come
[1:56:48] across the Jordan still come into the
[1:56:51] promised land where all things are
[1:56:54] possible to them that believe where that
[1:56:57] Every Word of Promise can be
[1:57:02] yours Hallelujah were the same signs
[1:57:04] that followed them follows you amen but
[1:57:08] but there again this is what happens is
[1:57:11] that that man come along and raise up
[1:57:15] and try to bring you down take you to
[1:57:17] another Camp hidden always
[1:57:20] away from the promised land remember
[1:57:22] when they came out to get us they moved
[1:57:24] away from the promised land and go to
[1:57:27] circle around and around the
[1:57:30] mountain now we have journeyed a long
[1:57:34] time and we needed a
[1:57:40] Joshua amen and we know that right now
[1:57:44] even the promised land is in sight and
[1:57:48] and you know we've had men that raised
[1:57:50] up to the ages denominational ages you
[1:57:54] know but the Bible promise that in the
[1:57:58] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:58:00] when he sounds his message then the
[1:58:04] mystery of God would be finished then
[1:58:06] there would be a people that would be
[1:58:08] back in the land and I I just want you
[1:58:11] to know that God already has his
[1:58:16] Joshua the end time leader to take us
[1:58:18] into the
[1:58:20] prise now this was of
[1:58:23] course would be the prophet of Malachi 4
[1:58:27] he was sent to restore us to the faith
[1:58:30] of the fathers what Abraham Isaac and
[1:58:32] Jacob had this is what Israel would get
[1:58:35] come on when they left Egypt and got
[1:58:37] into the land the same thing that had on
[1:58:40] the day of Pentecost this is what we are
[1:58:42] to have right here in the land every
[1:58:45] promise that lays in the Bible belongs
[1:58:48] to us do the prophet bringing
[1:58:51] restoration of Malachi 4 so now God had
[1:58:55] chosen brother brandham to to take a
[1:58:57] message of Divine Healing listen I I
[1:59:00] don't know how we get away from the
[1:59:03] supernatural when this message is rooted
[1:59:07] in the
[1:59:09] Supernatural listen this is not it it is
[1:59:12] not rooted and somebody just had a good
[1:59:15] thought or or you know studied the Bible
[1:59:18] and come up with this or that idea what
[1:59:20] happened there was a man there in
[1:59:24] 1946 being told of his misunderstood
[1:59:27] ways and you know that he was of the
[1:59:30] devil and he wanted all of these things
[1:59:32] to to leave him these these visions that
[1:59:36] he was having he was told it was of the
[1:59:37] devil and he he went away to pray about
[1:59:41] it and when he did there in the middle
[1:59:44] of the night here come a light into into
[1:59:49] the
[1:59:50] room and out of that light walked a 6ot
[1:59:54] tall man an angel of
[1:59:58] God in white robe hair to shoulders
[2:00:01] looking there at him and said that I
[2:00:04] have come from been sent from the
[2:00:06] presence of God to tell you of your
[2:00:09] misunderstood
[2:00:11] life and I'm sending you with a message
[2:00:14] of Divine Healing and this is going to
[2:00:18] forun the second coming of Christ this
[2:00:21] is going to
[2:00:22] initiate the second coming of Christ and
[2:00:24] I wanted just to say we're in
[2:00:27] it as a result of that visitation we are
[2:00:31] in it in that you know right in that
[2:00:34] same time frame 1946 1948 do you know in
[2:00:38] that same time frame here come Israel as
[2:00:41] a
[2:00:42] nation you know the Bible said that the
[2:00:44] tree that when you see the tree the Fig
[2:00:47] Tree puts forth his buds
[2:00:49] Israel's a viig tree and then it says in
[2:00:52] all the other trees so you had then a
[2:00:56] Revival that started taking a place in
[2:00:58] the denomination Billy Graham raises
[2:01:01] up come on you have all Roberts for the
[2:01:04] Pentecostal and they've been getting put
[2:01:06] forth
[2:01:07] branches right come on Amen the United
[2:01:11] Nation would start there and Gathering
[2:01:13] the Nations together and and they're all
[2:01:16] in this the World Council of churches
[2:01:18] would started the same time all
[2:01:21] Gathering Together are you with me a
[2:01:23] Revival was going on and at the same
[2:01:26] time the angel of God appeared first to
[2:01:28] a prophet of God sending a
[2:01:33] message and if you can look at see
[2:01:35] Israel in their rev having a Revival in
[2:01:38] their land and the Baptists and the
[2:01:40] Pentecostals have their Revival come on
[2:01:43] then what about the bride because that's
[2:01:45] what he said I will restore sayeth the
[2:01:48] Lord
[2:01:53] so already God had chose him to take a
[2:01:55] message in
[2:01:57] 1946 now in 1951 he would visit South
[2:02:03] Africa and he would learned there a very
[2:02:06] important
[2:02:08] lesson because he had you know tried to
[2:02:12] be inner denomination you know I don't
[2:02:14] care if you're one H hump two H hump
[2:02:16] camel whatever whatever you you believe
[2:02:18] Jesus coming on cloud you believe he's
[2:02:20] coming on a horse you know as long as
[2:02:21] you believe he's
[2:02:23] coming which is actually the framework
[2:02:26] of charismatic movement today we don't
[2:02:27] really care what you believe just as
[2:02:29] long as you believe in the gifts long as
[2:02:31] you believe in
[2:02:34] healing
[2:02:36] so in 1951 he would go to South
[2:02:41] Africa and he would learn there a very
[2:02:43] important
[2:02:45] lesson he would find out that
[2:02:47] denominations with political men would
[2:02:51] exalt themselves over the Vindicated
[2:02:54] word and would cause him to stray from
[2:02:57] the Vindicated
[2:03:01] path it was in September
[2:03:04] 1951 which is the beginning of summer
[2:03:07] for South
[2:03:09] Africa brother Sydney
[2:03:13] Jackson he was a man that you might have
[2:03:16] heard of brother brandham talks about
[2:03:18] him on tape but he was sitting there
[2:03:20] well you know one day praying and he
[2:03:23] heard himself say William Marian branam
[2:03:27] well this surprised him he had read
[2:03:28] about William brandham the American
[2:03:30] evangelist though had not been on his
[2:03:32] mind said but who was Marian brandham
[2:03:34] was that his wife or you know and and
[2:03:37] what did what did they have to do with
[2:03:39] missionaries in
[2:03:40] Africa and he knew that God was trying
[2:03:43] to tell him something but at the moment
[2:03:44] he didn't know what it was well the
[2:03:47] following night it was followed up by a
[2:03:49] dream that he saw where brother brandham
[2:03:52] was sitting in a stadium seat and he was
[2:03:55] smoking a cigarette well I troubled him
[2:04:00] because William brandham had a worldwide
[2:04:03] reputation as a man of God well you know
[2:04:05] why would he dream of such a godly man
[2:04:07] doing something as such so Unholy as
[2:04:10] smoking what in the world was God trying
[2:04:13] to tell him few weeks later he would
[2:04:16] find out that William brandham would be
[2:04:18] visit in South Africa in
[2:04:21] October they had a National Committee
[2:04:24] that
[2:04:24] was formed and it was composed of church
[2:04:27] leaders from South Africa's three
[2:04:30] largest Christian denominations the
[2:04:32] Dutch Reformed Church the English church
[2:04:34] in the Apostolic Faith Mission and they
[2:04:37] were sponsoring a two-month tour that
[2:04:41] would settle brother brandham around to
[2:04:43] 11 African cities and the tour would
[2:04:46] begin in Johannesburg on October the 3D
[2:04:50] and in 1951 and a program had been set
[2:04:53] up by the National Committee that had
[2:04:55] approved brother brandom's trip to South
[2:04:58] Africa and those days you would have to
[2:05:00] have somebody to sponsor you to come in
[2:05:03] because to gather a large group of
[2:05:05] people especially the blacks and the
[2:05:07] whites there was uh civil unrest in
[2:05:10] those days and it could cause riots and
[2:05:12] breaking out and so you know it was
[2:05:14] tightly controlled by the
[2:05:15] government but before to leave in South
[2:05:18] Africa
[2:05:19] brother brandham had received a prophecy
[2:05:21] in spport right here in sort
[2:05:25] Louisiana and God warned him in a dream
[2:05:28] or actually warned him uh in a prophecy
[2:05:33] that Satan was going to lay a trap for
[2:05:35] him in South Africa well you know he
[2:05:37] assumed the Trap would have something to
[2:05:40] do with doctors and demons and you know
[2:05:43] he asked the saints of God to pray you
[2:05:46] know somebody's going to oppose my gift
[2:05:48] to Divine healing or I'll be challenged
[2:05:50] by Devils I don't know what I'm going to
[2:05:52] face but you know the prophecy had rung
[2:05:54] out in spport that Satan was going to
[2:05:56] lay a trap for him well he arrived in
[2:05:59] South
[2:06:00] Africa you know he asked about his
[2:06:02] location and he found that the meetings
[2:06:05] were in
[2:06:07] Johannesburg and God had told him to go
[2:06:10] to
[2:06:11] Durban and and he you know he had a
[2:06:15] desire to go he he he really didn't want
[2:06:18] to just
[2:06:19] preached to the whites he was wanting to
[2:06:21] preach to the poor blacks who didn't
[2:06:24] have real opportunity and was was um you
[2:06:27] know living a suppressed
[2:06:30] lifestyle well in Johannesburg they
[2:06:33] would not allow whites and blacks to
[2:06:36] meet together in a meeting only in
[2:06:38] Durban was this able but the meetings
[2:06:41] were started there in marinan park
[2:06:43] Tabernacle it was not really an
[2:06:45] auditorium but it was a enormous op
[2:06:49] sided steel structure with a galvanized
[2:06:52] roof and it had once been the
[2:06:54] Johannesburg railway station but the
[2:06:57] Apostolic Faith Mission the largest
[2:07:00] Pentecostal denomination in South Africa
[2:07:03] had purchased this for Conference Center
[2:07:06] and and the Tabernacle covered a a you
[2:07:10] know a part of a crowd numbering around
[2:07:12] about 15,000 people well and then I I
[2:07:17] suppose outside of that could be set
[2:07:20] many more others but anyway when brother
[2:07:23] Bram found out what he where he was he
[2:07:25] says but all I know is that the Lord has
[2:07:28] spoke to me to go to
[2:07:30] Durban like I said he would find out
[2:07:33] later that he would be able to minister
[2:07:36] not just to the white population but
[2:07:38] also the Indian population that was
[2:07:40] there and the black population and it
[2:07:43] would be the only place in South Africa
[2:07:46] that he would be able to do this and and
[2:07:49] so but the National Committee of these
[2:07:53] denominational men refused to hear the
[2:07:57] word from the Lord that the angel
[2:07:59] instructed him you know to stay in
[2:08:02] Johannesburg and then rest take a rest
[2:08:06] with Sydney Jackson and and uh then
[2:08:10] after recuperating a bit from the
[2:08:11] strains of the meeting go to Durban and
[2:08:14] then God said I'll give you the country
[2:08:17] the angel had come and give him exact
[2:08:20] instructions on what to
[2:08:22] do now by the time he had met brother
[2:08:25] Sydney Jackson you know he actually
[2:08:27] would meet him as he was walking him and
[2:08:30] his wife was walking along uh uh the
[2:08:33] road and and he' stopped at the car and
[2:08:35] said jump out and he said I want to talk
[2:08:38] to this man and he he walks over and he
[2:08:40] introduces himself your name your name
[2:08:42] is Sydney Jackson I've seen you in a
[2:08:44] vision and he said I don't smoke but
[2:08:47] your dream me means that I'm listening
[2:08:49] to man instead of the Holy Spirit and
[2:08:52] besides my middle name is
[2:08:56] Maran and you know then he would then he
[2:09:00] then he would tell the the men over and
[2:09:02] again it is not the will of God for us
[2:09:05] to take this tour of 11 cities I am to
[2:09:08] minister here in Jo Johannesburg I am to
[2:09:11] go to rest with brother Jackson and
[2:09:13] recuperate from the meetings and then
[2:09:15] I'm going to to Durban and God said I'll
[2:09:17] give you the
[2:09:18] country but the National Committee was
[2:09:22] was
[2:09:23] indignant to think that this man
[2:09:27] thought that God only spoke to
[2:09:31] him God speaks to us too and God led us
[2:09:35] to take this
[2:09:37] itinerary and of course their itinerary
[2:09:40] was denominational minded it was based
[2:09:43] on political favors to certain pastors
[2:09:47] and of course thousand thousands of
[2:09:48] dollars had been spent on advert
[2:09:51] advertisings and meeting halls and
[2:09:53] rentals and and everything else and so
[2:09:56] they had quite a bit invested already
[2:09:58] and made these plans and made these
[2:10:00] promises we'll be here this night and
[2:10:02] there and people were making vacations
[2:10:04] and plans and whatever to to come to
[2:10:06] those meetings and here brother Brandon
[2:10:08] said I'm not to do
[2:10:11] it and he said God may have led you to
[2:10:13] follow this itinerary but he told me not
[2:10:15] to do
[2:10:17] it so he then he would show sign after
[2:10:21] sign of vindications telling them things
[2:10:24] of events we're going to go and we're
[2:10:26] going to we're going to stop here at a
[2:10:29] little trinket place along the road and
[2:10:31] we'll see a woman there with a scar on
[2:10:34] her face and then just as soon as we see
[2:10:37] her there will be some kind of a bird
[2:10:41] I'm not familiar with with it makes a
[2:10:43] big squawking noise that will fly
[2:10:46] over well the man he he told him you
[2:10:49] know about that and he said well I'll
[2:10:51] tell you he said there's a lot of them
[2:10:52] vendors along the way they didn't see
[2:10:55] any of them and here they get to the
[2:10:56] outskirts of where they're going and and
[2:10:58] here here he he says hey there's there's
[2:11:02] a stand right there so they turn around
[2:11:05] and go back and they go back and they
[2:11:07] said see here's that woman with that
[2:11:09] scarf
[2:11:10] face and it just as he said that here
[2:11:13] comes a big wild peacock flying over
[2:11:17] squawking and there would be sign after
[2:11:20] sign after sign he would break off
[2:11:23] branches as they were headed toward uh
[2:11:26] toward the city taking him to a city
[2:11:29] that he didn't that he was told not to
[2:11:31] go to and he break off branches and hit
[2:11:33] them on the feet and say thus sayith the
[2:11:36] Lord we're out of the will of
[2:11:38] God so we'll have nothing but trouble
[2:11:40] from on
[2:11:41] them and and so the committee however
[2:11:45] had set up their own itinerary to go
[2:11:48] from one small City to
[2:11:50] another and it turns out they would
[2:11:54] dismiss this meeting of thousands where
[2:11:57] the newspaper was writing favorable
[2:11:59] articles where the doctor's Association
[2:12:02] was supporting them and and everything
[2:12:04] else and they had the support of the
[2:12:07] whole people and they would close that
[2:12:08] meeting these men and go to another
[2:12:11] little town that wouldn't accommodate 3
[2:12:14] or 400 people in the church because they
[2:12:17] promised Brothers so and so we're going
[2:12:18] to take him there and they had to
[2:12:21] scratch his back and and and the backs
[2:12:24] of different denomination you'll have
[2:12:25] him one night and then we'll have them
[2:12:27] another night and you'll have them
[2:12:28] another night and even brother Bosworth
[2:12:32] spoke against the instructions of the
[2:12:34] Angel of the Lord after seeing thousands
[2:12:37] upon thousands of times and he said I
[2:12:39] believe if you'll go with this these men
[2:12:41] and do what they said you know you're
[2:12:43] going to see the exceeding abundantly
[2:12:45] and they had nothing but trouble after
[2:12:47] that
[2:12:49] you see and and the deal of it is here
[2:12:51] he is in a strange country he has no
[2:12:54] money and he couldn't do nothing by
[2:12:57] himself and now they've dismissed the
[2:12:59] meetings at
[2:13:01] Johannesburg he would have to have the
[2:13:03] same Corporation of the the corporation
[2:13:05] of the same men who were now opposing
[2:13:08] the his move to to go back he was in a
[2:13:10] terrible fix and and and as he sat there
[2:13:14] he remembered the
[2:13:15] prophecy Satan's got a trap La for you
[2:13:19] and he realized here was a trap right
[2:13:22] here among his Christian Brethren the
[2:13:24] political jaws of the denominational
[2:13:27] system had snap closed around him
[2:13:30] holding him firmly in their cold
[2:13:32] unyielding teeth keeping him from doing
[2:13:34] what the Lord had told him to do and his
[2:13:37] situation seemed
[2:13:39] hopeless and so
[2:13:42] trapped he told you know he couldn't do
[2:13:45] anything and said here I am strange
[2:13:48] country no money I the these are one
[2:13:50] funded they won't cooperate God told me
[2:13:52] not to do it they're taking me anyway
[2:13:55] what am I to
[2:13:57] do and so he so told the brother said
[2:14:00] we'll have nothing but trouble we're out
[2:14:02] of the will of God we're in this
[2:14:04] permissive will so well if it's his
[2:14:05] permissive will W don't you go ask God
[2:14:07] if we can have his permissive
[2:14:09] will let me tell you something you
[2:14:12] always want to walk in God's perfect
[2:14:16] will permiss I will will cause you a lot
[2:14:19] of trouble now if you're predestinated
[2:14:23] you'll finally get back on the path of
[2:14:24] the perfect
[2:14:27] will but you didn't have to go come on I
[2:14:30] want to say this Jonah you know Jonah
[2:14:33] could have done what God said he didn't
[2:14:36] have to take a ship to Tarsus he didn't
[2:14:39] have to take a ride in the
[2:14:41] whale he didn't have to have three days
[2:14:44] and nights in a dark belly of a well and
[2:14:46] seaweed and bombit around he didn't have
[2:14:49] to suffer like that he could have just
[2:14:51] did what God
[2:14:53] Said but he was stubborn and he wanted
[2:14:56] his own way and he ran from the presence
[2:14:58] of God and what happened he got into
[2:15:01] trouble and so will
[2:15:03] you you want to stay in God's perfect
[2:15:08] will come on Amen you know so tra he he
[2:15:14] he he had to ask for God's permission of
[2:15:18] will the angel of God came and he said
[2:15:21] the men want to know can I go can you
[2:15:25] give me your permissive will he said you
[2:15:29] can go but you will pay for
[2:15:33] it now listen he was training his
[2:15:37] Prophet for a greater
[2:15:44] job and brother brandham would suffer
[2:15:47] for months and months almost dying from
[2:15:50] an
[2:15:51] amoeba and although the meetings were
[2:15:54] tremendous and miraculous he finally did
[2:15:56] get to to Durban but it didn't even come
[2:16:00] close to God's full
[2:16:03] blessings and after his return to the
[2:16:05] states the doctors tried to cure him and
[2:16:07] he came close to the point of death and
[2:16:10] the angel Lord would not speak to him he
[2:16:12] would go for months and the angel would
[2:16:15] not visit
[2:16:16] him and after months and months of
[2:16:19] suffering even the doctor said you're
[2:16:22] just so close to it get in your blood
[2:16:24] once he get in that blood stream you're
[2:16:26] dead and you're so close it's breaking
[2:16:29] out now and there's nothing we can do
[2:16:31] it's you know you you're You're gone you
[2:16:34] might better put your house in order CU
[2:16:35] you're you're a dying
[2:16:37] man and there after pleading repenting
[2:16:42] calling on God finally the angel of the
[2:16:45] Lord appeared and he told him he was
[2:16:46] forgiven
[2:16:49] and he would have no further issues from
[2:16:50] the amoeba he would actually go back to
[2:16:53] the doctor that day and get another test
[2:16:56] said do another test well we did it
[2:16:58] yesterday well get another one said the
[2:17:00] Lord visited me did another test said I
[2:17:03] don't know what to say but you don't
[2:17:04] have not one
[2:17:07] sign but during the visitation from the
[2:17:11] Lord he was startled to see his Bible
[2:17:15] rise up all for the night stand by the
[2:17:18] bed and Float across the room and sto in
[2:17:22] front of him and it would and and as it
[2:17:26] was still hanging there it was open to
[2:17:28] Acts chapter 27 where Paul was speaking
[2:17:32] to the crew of his prison ship during a
[2:17:35] ter terrible storm and and and a and
[2:17:39] there a hand appeared above the text and
[2:17:42] pointed to the verses while he
[2:17:44] read Paul stood in the midst of them and
[2:17:47] said s you should have hearkened to me
[2:17:50] and not loose from creit to have gained
[2:17:53] this harm and loss now I exhort you to
[2:17:56] be of good cheer for there should be no
[2:17:58] loss of any man's life among you but of
[2:18:00] the ship for there stood be by me this
[2:18:03] night the angel of God who said who I am
[2:18:06] and whom I serve saying fear not Paul
[2:18:08] thou must be brought before Caesar and
[2:18:10] lo God has given thee all them that sail
[2:18:13] with thee wherefore serves be of good
[2:18:15] cheer for I believe God that it shall be
[2:18:17] even as he told me and as soon as he
[2:18:21] finished reading this portion of
[2:18:23] scripture that same floating hand took
[2:18:27] and flipped the Bible right over to
[2:18:28] Joshua chapter 1 and it pointed at verse
[2:18:32] two and followed down the lines and said
[2:18:34] Moses my servant is dead now
[2:18:39] arise and go over this Jordan thou and
[2:18:41] all this people to the land which I give
[2:18:43] them even to the children of Israel
[2:18:47] every place place that the soul of your
[2:18:48] foot shall tread upon have I given to
[2:18:50] you and then he seemed to stress verse
[2:18:53] five and six there shall not be any man
[2:18:55] be able to stay stand before thee all
[2:18:57] the days of thy life as I was with Moses
[2:19:00] so will I be with thee I will not fail
[2:19:02] thee nor forsake the be strong and of
[2:19:05] good courage For unto this people Thou
[2:19:07] shalt divide an inheritance which I
[2:19:10] swear unto their fathers to give them I
[2:19:13] want you to notice here's a commission
[2:19:15] here the finger is going right down
[2:19:17] Joshua chapter 1 and as it is it's given
[2:19:21] him a
[2:19:22] commission and said you will divide for
[2:19:26] inheritance the land which I swear to
[2:19:30] their fathers to give them just be
[2:19:32] strong and courageous that thou May
[2:19:35] observe to do according to all the law
[2:19:37] which Moses my servant commanded thee
[2:19:39] turn not from the right hand to the left
[2:19:42] that thou May Prosper wherever thou
[2:19:44] goest this book of the law shall not
[2:19:46] depart out of thy mouth but thou shall
[2:19:47] meditate in day and night that thou
[2:19:49] mayest observe to do according to all
[2:19:52] that's written therein for then Thou
[2:19:54] shalt make thy way prosperous and then
[2:19:56] thou shall have good success have not I
[2:19:58] commanded thee be strong and of good
[2:20:01] courage Be not
[2:20:04] Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the
[2:20:07] Lord thy God is with thee wherever you
[2:20:09] go so you know now reading that he had
[2:20:13] to understand how that Joshua chapter
[2:20:16] one appli to him as I was with Moses as
[2:20:20] I as I have led them out of bondage as I
[2:20:23] brought him to this place so will I be
[2:20:26] with you and it was God's Declaration of
[2:20:31] his commitment to this ministry and and
[2:20:35] he and here he was showing a specific
[2:20:39] connection between his ministry and
[2:20:42] Joshua that's why I hear why I say you
[2:20:44] hear anybody else said well we're the
[2:20:46] Joshua rais up you know that ain't true
[2:20:49] God already sent the Bible down and the
[2:20:52] angel of God come on a hand going right
[2:20:56] down and saying as I was with Moses so
[2:21:00] shall I be with you it was God
[2:21:02] commissioning him to lead the church
[2:21:05] into a spiritual Promised Land the same
[2:21:08] way that Joshua had had led Israel into
[2:21:12] a natural promised land so he said be of
[2:21:16] good courage you know Thou shalt and
[2:21:19] this people shalt divide for an
[2:21:21] inheritance of the land so this would be
[2:21:24] the job or the work of the seventh angel
[2:21:28] messenger he would be sent to do what to
[2:21:32] divide the
[2:21:35] inheritance now you say brother T why
[2:21:38] would the inheritance need to be divided
[2:21:41] why would it need to be defined you know
[2:21:46] why would he I have to okay Joshua would
[2:21:49] have to know what belonged to Israel
[2:21:53] What lands they were to possess are you
[2:21:56] with me so they would he would have to
[2:21:58] know what lands so he he would tell them
[2:22:02] now Moab don't bother them I've given
[2:22:05] the children of lot an inheritance leave
[2:22:09] them alone he would say of Esau Edom he
[2:22:13] said leave Esau alone I have given him
[2:22:17] the mount sier don't try to take
[2:22:21] that here is the definition of your
[2:22:23] borders from the river Euphrates to the
[2:22:26] Sea and he would go and Define the
[2:22:29] borders to tell them what belonged to
[2:22:33] Israel what was theirs to possess now
[2:22:37] you say but how's that applicable to us
[2:22:40] well how in the world do you think then
[2:22:43] that we how in the world do you think at
[2:22:46] all that we as as a people of God would
[2:22:49] know what to possess if we're over here
[2:22:51] trying to be the
[2:22:53] 144,000 or if we're trying to be the
[2:22:56] multitude without number coming out of
[2:22:58] Great
[2:23:00] Tribulation amen we have to know what is
[2:23:04] our inheritance what is our
[2:23:08] borders I'm glad to know that our
[2:23:10] borders do not
[2:23:12] extend over into the
[2:23:16] tribulation
[2:23:18] amen that you're that the Rapture takes
[2:23:20] place before the
[2:23:22] tribulation amen how do we know that
[2:23:24] because we have had a Joshua and said
[2:23:28] that does not belong to the bride it
[2:23:30] belongs to the church who will go
[2:23:33] through the tribulation but for you
[2:23:35] there is nothing of that don't worry
[2:23:38] about it at all no matter how hot the
[2:23:41] Winds of tribulation are blowing and
[2:23:44] what you feel around you a
[2:23:46] pre-tribulation and problems that are
[2:23:48] coming you can know this amen he's got
[2:23:51] to stop because it's not our
[2:23:55] land you're going to be raptured out of
[2:23:57] here before that
[2:23:59] time you don't have to be the 144,000
[2:24:03] you don't have to be a tribulation Saint
[2:24:06] you have been called to a promised land
[2:24:09] and God has defined your
[2:24:12] [Applause]
[2:24:14] borders well but everything in the book
[2:24:17] is mine no the great ain't
[2:24:21] yours her destruction ain't yours
[2:24:24] tribulation ain't yours we say every
[2:24:27] promise you know in the book is mine no
[2:24:29] every promise for the bride is
[2:24:34] mine there's some things I don't
[2:24:37] want there's some things that ain't for
[2:24:40] us are you with me so you see again
[2:24:45] again what lays in the land I mean what
[2:24:47] are we looking forward to Israel would
[2:24:50] go back to their land in
[2:24:53] 1948 and they would say we have come to
[2:24:57] see the
[2:24:59] Messiah and that's what I want you to
[2:25:02] know here we have returned to this land
[2:25:06] to see the Messiah to have a people
[2:25:09] ready for his name's sake it is time for
[2:25:12] this scripture to be fulfilled Brethren
[2:25:15] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[2:25:17] kingdom of God neither do corruption
[2:25:20] inherit corruption but behold I show you
[2:25:22] a mystery we will not all sleep I'm
[2:25:26] telling you what's in the land we shall
[2:25:29] not all sleep but we shall all be
[2:25:31] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[2:25:35] eye at the last Trump and that last
[2:25:38] Trump shall sound and Revelation 4 says
[2:25:41] it says come up hither amen and the dead
[2:25:43] shall rise Incorruptible and we shall be
[2:25:47] changed for this corruption must put on
[2:25:51] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[2:25:55] immortality
[2:25:57] Hallelujah that lays in the land now we
[2:26:02] know now we know who it was that God
[2:26:06] would
[2:26:07] use to by the Holy Spirit remember it's
[2:26:11] the holy spirit's the leader is the holy
[2:26:14] spirit still here brother Brandon may be
[2:26:17] gone but the holy spirit is still here
[2:26:19] but it's the Holy Spirit still here
[2:26:21] using a vessel look so so he would he
[2:26:26] would tell us you know that it would
[2:26:29] represent the end time leader now so now
[2:26:32] in there we we see that the promised
[2:26:35] land is now coming in
[2:26:39] sight as as he as he said
[2:26:44] I lost my thing
[2:26:48] well it's under my Bible yeah there it
[2:26:53] is so you know you know I now he said
[2:26:56] let's stand like Joshua and Caleb our
[2:27:00] promised land is coming in sight as
[2:27:03] theirs
[2:27:04] did that Joshua means Jehovah Savior and
[2:27:09] he represents the end time leader that
[2:27:11] will come to the church even as Paul
[2:27:13] came as original leader now then notice
[2:27:15] here in the message Paradox he would
[2:27:18] have he would have a vision there as as
[2:27:22] um there he said I was coming down to
[2:27:25] the Jordan it looked like I was standing
[2:27:28] on the map of Palestine and as I was
[2:27:31] coming to the Jordan it seemed like I
[2:27:34] could
[2:27:35] hear I could hear them sing the song I
[2:27:39] am going down to the Jordan someone was
[2:27:42] singing it and as I drew near the river
[2:27:45] I looked back and seen which way I'd
[2:27:48] come and I was 2third of the way there
[2:27:52] to the Jordan and I looked across Jordan
[2:27:56] and I said oh praise God just on the
[2:28:01] other
[2:28:02] side is where all the promises lay every
[2:28:07] promise lays in the promised land can't
[2:28:11] you see now this is why we want to be in
[2:28:15] the promised land because it's there
[2:28:17] every promis is laid now then he would
[2:28:20] have the vision of The Binding of the of
[2:28:23] the of the Mamba serpent you know which
[2:28:26] is death and when for the serpent is to
[2:28:29] be bound and death is defeated by an end
[2:28:33] time people for we are to be alive and
[2:28:36] remain at the come of the Lord and be
[2:28:38] changed in a moment and a twinkling I
[2:28:41] the only people as a group who defi
[2:28:45] death who defeats
[2:28:48] death are you with me so he comes down
[2:28:52] the end of his sermon now in Paradox now
[2:28:54] you see what coming down to Jordan meant
[2:28:57] we're down here now let's cross over
[2:29:00] let's quit playing this is good
[2:29:02] admonition for all of you let's cross on
[2:29:05] the other side cuz it all belongs to us
[2:29:07] it is all ours the business has never
[2:29:09] failed they can't fail because they come
[2:29:11] from God I believe it with all that's
[2:29:13] within me we're not the hireling that
[2:29:16] are run back in the wilderness we'll
[2:29:18] cross Jordan to separation then he says
[2:29:21] God break to us the seals that's on the
[2:29:24] back of the book let us enter into this
[2:29:27] great place now for Joshua divided to
[2:29:30] the people their inheritance that God
[2:29:33] left for them amen so again what was it
[2:29:38] now notice what it be it would God
[2:29:40] breaking the
[2:29:41] seals that would bring us across Jordan
[2:29:47] the book The Land had to been
[2:29:50] open it had been sealed with Seven
[2:29:53] Seals amen the mysteries of it were not
[2:29:57] known many had proved at it but they
[2:30:00] didn't know it they could not know it
[2:30:03] until the days of the voice of the
[2:30:05] seventh angel when he began to sound his
[2:30:07] message are you with me now so there
[2:30:11] again our Ephesian our Joshua which
[2:30:13] means the Holy Spirit Joshua means
[2:30:15] Jehovah's savior Joshua means the Holy
[2:30:18] Spirit represented as the spiritual as
[2:30:21] it was in the natural and he's our great
[2:30:23] warrior he's our great leader as Joshua
[2:30:26] God was with Joshua so is God in the
[2:30:30] Holy Spirit moving us about and When sin
[2:30:33] comes in the camp the Holy Spirit
[2:30:35] Demands a halt what's wrong in this
[2:30:37] church something's wrong now oh can't
[2:30:41] you see how we got too many sons of Kiss
[2:30:43] now too many Sauls coming from SIM
[2:30:46] minaries and Theological schools and
[2:30:48] going out and teaching perverse things
[2:30:50] as the Bible said they would do
[2:30:53] seemingly not having the faith
[2:30:55] separating themselves from you having no
[2:30:57] fellowship with you and having a form of
[2:30:59] godliness and denying the power thereof
[2:31:01] from such turn away I just want to say
[2:31:04] how many Souls have we seen raised
[2:31:07] up men who men men that were made King
[2:31:11] by the
[2:31:13] people are you with me amen but just
[2:31:17] just just again they come from from
[2:31:20] theological School in other words
[2:31:22] educated men educating themselves into
[2:31:26] the truth and they wind up bringing
[2:31:28] perverse things and then they separate
[2:31:31] themselves and now you got to come to us
[2:31:33] or you don't you're not a part of
[2:31:39] it and where is the
[2:31:42] power where is the courage to defeat G
[2:31:47] lith where is the power in the church
[2:31:51] amen to cast out
[2:31:53] Devils what is it been too many Souls
[2:31:57] have risen
[2:31:58] up men who were not called of God and
[2:32:01] ordained of God Amen now notice here as
[2:32:06] we go on in the message adoption he said
[2:32:09] he speaks of this how that Moses the
[2:32:11] great miracle performer brought them
[2:32:13] down down Israel down to the land
[2:32:15] brought them to to the promised land but
[2:32:17] did not Place their inheritance to them
[2:32:19] he did not give them their inheritance
[2:32:20] he led them up to the land but Joshua
[2:32:22] divided the land to the people is that
[2:32:24] right and Christ brought the church up
[2:32:26] to a place where their possession was
[2:32:28] made to them was given to them just the
[2:32:30] Jordan to cross but the holy spirit is
[2:32:32] the one who sets the church in order the
[2:32:35] Joshua today puts the church in its
[2:32:37] order given to each one not taken
[2:32:41] away given to each one gifts places
[2:32:45] position and he is the voice of God
[2:32:48] speaking to the inner man that Christ
[2:32:50] has saved the Holy Spirit now you get
[2:32:52] that that much of it where we're getting
[2:32:54] over into the book of Ephesians that
[2:32:56] that's the way he positionally plac in
[2:32:58] the church where they belong and Joshua
[2:33:01] placed them in that natural land and the
[2:33:02] Holy Spirit is placing the church
[2:33:05] positionally in the land that in the
[2:33:08] position they belong in their
[2:33:11] inheritance amen now so again as we as
[2:33:16] we look at this and I'm just going to
[2:33:18] skip down through some of this right
[2:33:19] here because we are I I want to get to
[2:33:22] get so to to some of this as we go
[2:33:26] along
[2:33:29] now going here you know you cannot you
[2:33:32] cannot break one of these
[2:33:34] types there has to be a people in this
[2:33:37] last day cross over and like I said I
[2:33:41] believe we have I believe that's what
[2:33:43] this message has done I believe it sent
[2:33:46] us to Joshua of this day the holy spirit
[2:33:49] that lead us to the land and and has to
[2:33:52] speak through
[2:33:53] somebody because he's a spirit so God
[2:33:57] would choose a messenger of Malachi 4 to
[2:34:00] do that right amen so the Holy Spirit
[2:34:04] would come among the church to get the
[2:34:07] people ready get among the people to get
[2:34:08] her ready to go up now let's go on down
[2:34:12] just a little
[2:34:14] bit but what is the old
[2:34:19] horn in the
[2:34:22] wilderness they had the
[2:34:24] Mana but in the promised land they ate
[2:34:28] the grain produced in
[2:34:31] Canaan no longer Wilderness food but the
[2:34:34] same food that Abraham had eaten if you
[2:34:38] watch this translation it doesn't say
[2:34:41] old corn it mean it says they ate the
[2:34:44] fruit of the land
[2:34:47] notice here you know the first thing
[2:34:49] that would happen would be the Passover
[2:34:51] think about it they couldn't have the
[2:34:52] Passover in the wilderness there was no
[2:34:58] grain come on only
[2:35:01] Mana there was no grain they couldn't
[2:35:03] make bread unleavened
[2:35:05] bread so it was only till when they come
[2:35:08] into the land could they come now into
[2:35:12] the
[2:35:13] Passover only in there would they circum
[2:35:16] eyes the new generation only in there in
[2:35:20] the land are you with me amen would
[2:35:23] would would be there where that they
[2:35:25] would now come and eat of the old
[2:35:29] produce the same thing the same food the
[2:35:32] same food that Isaac Drew and during a
[2:35:36] famine he planted rather than going down
[2:35:38] to Egypt but stayed in the land where
[2:35:40] God told him and during the famine
[2:35:42] reaped a h hundredfold you know that
[2:35:46] tell you stay in the promised land stay
[2:35:49] in the word you want to be blessed
[2:35:51] that's where you're going to find your
[2:35:53] blessing amen now so again again stay in
[2:35:58] that promised land now the Book of
[2:36:00] Joshua starts out Moses my servant is
[2:36:03] dead I'm going to go I'm going to go
[2:36:06] just a little longer now just so hold on
[2:36:08] your seat I hope you brought a big
[2:36:13] vessel the Book of Joshua starts out
[2:36:16] Moses my servant is dead remember it
[2:36:19] represented the law a system of religion
[2:36:21] it was dead it come its Jordan it left
[2:36:24] him right right up to the
[2:36:26] border and in the land the whole word
[2:36:29] would be opened up even the seven
[2:36:32] thunders of Revelation
[2:36:35] 10 the Thunders of the voice of God
[2:36:38] sealed up for the last age for those
[2:36:42] that entered the land they would they
[2:36:44] would be heard and and and revealed and
[2:36:48] opened the seven sealed Book of
[2:36:50] Revelation in other words open the
[2:36:53] entire word of God back to us
[2:36:56] again amen now so the Book of Joshua
[2:37:00] starts out Moses my servant is death now
[2:37:03] this has been used by every Kingdom
[2:37:06] Builder who builds their own many
[2:37:09] denomination they they take brother
[2:37:11] brandom and type him as Moses say okay
[2:37:14] the prophet's dead Moses Moes is dead so
[2:37:17] now I'm going to lead the bride into the
[2:37:19] land of
[2:37:21] promise but Moses didn't type brother
[2:37:25] brandham Jo Joshua was his
[2:37:29] type the angel said as I was with Moses
[2:37:33] as I've used down to the ages as the
[2:37:36] spirit has moved and led them from place
[2:37:39] to place to this land I will be with you
[2:37:42] same Pillar of Fire
[2:37:44] leading are you with me
[2:37:46] amen but as I was with Moses I'll be
[2:37:48] with you you are the Joshua with a
[2:37:51] commission to place the people in their
[2:37:55] inheritance now some of you might have
[2:37:58] heard of of Brother Joseph Coleman who
[2:38:01] back in the 70s he started the seven
[2:38:04] Thunder
[2:38:05] movement and uh and and then and then
[2:38:10] with the seven Thunder movement there he
[2:38:12] he um said that they were the seven
[2:38:15] virtues that Peter wrote and they and
[2:38:18] they there's a whole movement out there
[2:38:20] a whole Camp still out in the wilderness
[2:38:23] wandering around that claimed that
[2:38:26] brother Coleman was to Joshua after
[2:38:28] brother brandham that like Moses was
[2:38:31] dead now he was to lead the bride over
[2:38:33] to place her into inheritance he thought
[2:38:36] his ministry was needed to be bring
[2:38:40] Clarity and it only muddled the
[2:38:43] truth until many of more many people
[2:38:46] will not even mention the seven Thunders
[2:38:48] cuz they don't want to be identified
[2:38:49] with that and it's become a
[2:38:53] scarecrow now again I want you to
[2:38:56] remember every time one of these
[2:38:57] movements rise up it is smiting The Rock
[2:39:02] again and it's a man exalting himself
[2:39:05] see what I can
[2:39:06] do and when it does yeah people get a
[2:39:10] Revival and people jump and shout and
[2:39:12] people go on but it don't take them to
[2:39:14] the promised land
[2:39:16] from there they get bit with fiery
[2:39:20] serpents
[2:39:23] now let's go a little further in
[2:39:25] this as far as the Thunders being
[2:39:29] virtues there's not one place in the
[2:39:32] message where brother brandham says the
[2:39:34] Thunders with the Seven
[2:39:36] Virtues because how could Peter write
[2:39:39] what John was forbidden
[2:39:43] to now some of you maybe you don't
[2:39:48] know and and maybe maybe I should take a
[2:39:52] little more time with this but maybe
[2:39:55] maybe sometimes you don't know and you
[2:39:57] don't understand what the Seven Virtues
[2:40:00] are but Peter said right here he said
[2:40:04] and besides all of this did I miss it
[2:40:08] it's right
[2:40:10] there yeah Peter Peter remember Peter
[2:40:15] Peter wrote and said besides all this
[2:40:16] given all diligence add your faith
[2:40:19] virtue to Virtue knowledge knowledge
[2:40:21] Temperance Temperance patience patience
[2:40:23] godliness and godliness brotherly
[2:40:25] kindness and brotherly kindness charity
[2:40:27] so you see there are seven ads Seven
[2:40:30] Virtues to add to your faith so you know
[2:40:33] they are virtue knowledge Temperance
[2:40:36] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[2:40:38] and charity and they propose that these
[2:40:40] are the Thunders and of course that was
[2:40:42] wrong they are not the
[2:40:44] Thunders now what are the seven Thunders
[2:40:48] and why are they important to us because
[2:40:52] we needed the voice of
[2:40:54] God which a thunder is a voice of God
[2:40:58] but it's something that was said that
[2:41:00] wasn't meant for that
[2:41:03] time and so it was sealed
[2:41:07] up until the days of the voice of the
[2:41:10] seventh angel when he begins the sound
[2:41:13] now so you see so this this is why
[2:41:16] brother brandom you know is asked the
[2:41:19] question he said have the seven Thunders
[2:41:21] which equal the seven Mysteries already
[2:41:23] been revealed were they revealed in the
[2:41:25] Seven Seals but not known yet yet to
[2:41:28] Thunders yet no they were revealed in
[2:41:32] the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders
[2:41:35] was about so if you want to know what
[2:41:37] the Thunders
[2:41:40] are they were revealed in the Seven
[2:41:44] Seals You See It Was Written in
[2:41:49] symbols but the mystery couldn't be made
[2:41:52] known to the last day because it would
[2:41:56] be for the people who came back to the
[2:41:58] land to open up the land to unseal the
[2:42:03] book to bring us into the fullness of
[2:42:07] the word so you see they were revealed
[2:42:10] in the Seven Seals that's what the
[2:42:13] Thunders was about now if you want to
[2:42:16] know what the Thunders are there it
[2:42:21] is and guess what it didn't take me to
[2:42:23] bring it that's right come on it didn't
[2:42:27] take some other preacher to rise up
[2:42:29] that's it didn't take somebody else a
[2:42:32] prophet in this day heard the voice of
[2:42:37] God every every day I was about to make
[2:42:42] a horrible mistake I was going to take
[2:42:44] what others had said said about the seal
[2:42:46] and i' read there about Smith and this
[2:42:49] and the other but about that time he
[2:42:51] came in the room and he changed my
[2:42:54] thinking entirely and now we know that
[2:42:58] which was written in symbol amen which
[2:43:02] was left for a later day amen and the
[2:43:06] interpretation left for another day but
[2:43:09] had to be written in the Bible cuz you
[2:43:11] can't put an addition to the word of God
[2:43:13] so it had to be written in the word so
[2:43:16] now a prophet comes in the last day with
[2:43:19] Divine
[2:43:20] interpretation and says here you are
[2:43:23] here is the ver seal and it is not
[2:43:27] Christ it is the Antichrist and it's not
[2:43:30] writing in the tribulation is starting
[2:43:33] out over here in this first age and
[2:43:36] begins his ride and it's the
[2:43:40] Antichrist how did we know that the
[2:43:44] Thunder the voice of God
[2:43:48] spoken what was once
[2:43:51] misunderstood now becomes
[2:43:54] revealed
[2:43:56] amen now then notice this the seven
[2:44:00] Thunders are the revelations contained
[2:44:02] in the Seven Seals the messenger of
[2:44:05] Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going
[2:44:08] to do two things one according to
[2:44:10] Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the
[2:44:12] children to the fathers two he will
[2:44:15] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[2:44:17] thunders in Revelation 10 which are the
[2:44:21] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[2:44:25] it will be these divinely mystery
[2:44:29] revealed truths that literally turn the
[2:44:33] hearts of the children to the
[2:44:34] Pentecostal fathers exactly so so you
[2:44:38] see it's really
[2:44:40] important it's not something to be
[2:44:42] glossed over it's something that that
[2:44:45] must become understood what is a thunder
[2:44:49] a thunder is When God Says something but
[2:44:53] he doesn't want it known
[2:44:55] yet or he says something and it's not
[2:44:59] for those that are nearby it's for a
[2:45:02] particular person now I want you to
[2:45:05] understand the seven Thunders was not
[2:45:08] for the first eight the second the third
[2:45:10] the fourth the fifth the sixth the seven
[2:45:13] Thunders would be re served to the
[2:45:16] people of the end time look here Jesus
[2:45:19] said now is my soul trouble he's on the
[2:45:22] way to the cross and what shall I say
[2:45:24] father save me from this hour but for
[2:45:26] this cause came out in the world father
[2:45:28] glorify thy name then there came a voice
[2:45:31] from Heaven saying I have both glorified
[2:45:34] it and will glorify it again the people
[2:45:36] therefore that stood by and heard it
[2:45:40] said it
[2:45:43] thundered others said an angel
[2:45:47] spoke but Jesus knew what it meant it
[2:45:51] was a message to him amen saying I have
[2:45:55] both glorified and will glorified again
[2:45:58] and the others standing by only heard of
[2:46:01] Thunder that's right now for Seven Ages
[2:46:04] that's all we heard was Thunder God had
[2:46:08] said something but we didn't know what
[2:46:11] it meant because it wasn't for them
[2:46:17] do you realize what I'm talking about
[2:46:19] now because it's for you it's for you
[2:46:23] it's a word reserved for an end time
[2:46:27] people are you with me so God would hold
[2:46:30] it
[2:46:33] back you see because in it it would have
[2:46:36] to tell you you're this is the last AG
[2:46:39] well he couldn't let them know in that
[2:46:42] first age now there's going to be 2,000
[2:46:44] years and seven Church ages so he wrote
[2:46:48] it in symbols unto the angel of Church
[2:46:51] of Ephesus and the angel of Church of
[2:46:53] Smyrna and and the Seven Stars in the
[2:46:55] hand of John oh nobody knows what all of
[2:46:57] this means or when it applies I've heard
[2:47:00] preachers preach United Pentecostal
[2:47:02] preacher one of their one of their top
[2:47:04] men was I heard him preach and said well
[2:47:06] I believe we are in the Philadelphian
[2:47:08] Church age I said you're an age behind
[2:47:11] buddy but you don't know I wouldn't know
[2:47:16] that's right but God sent a prophet and
[2:47:18] Vindicated him so I would
[2:47:20] know because it is given to you to know
[2:47:24] the mysteries of the Kingdom but to them
[2:47:27] it is not given so he would write it in
[2:47:29] Parables and symbol that would not be
[2:47:32] understood until the last day when a
[2:47:36] people had come back to the land again
[2:47:39] and the land that would be open up that
[2:47:41] would open up every promise of God
[2:47:46] hallu
[2:47:49] Hallelujah so let's just look at this
[2:47:51] for a minute I'd like to carry this one
[2:47:54] more scripture down hope you can read
[2:47:56] this but it says and I saw another
[2:47:59] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[2:48:01] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow upon
[2:48:03] his head and his face was as it were the
[2:48:05] sun his feet is pillars of fire and I've
[2:48:07] been through this many times with you
[2:48:09] and he had in his hand a little book
[2:48:11] open and he set his right hand upon the
[2:48:14] sea and his left foot on the earth and
[2:48:16] he cried with a loud voice as a lion
[2:48:18] roar and when he had cried seven
[2:48:20] Thunders uttered their voices and when
[2:48:22] the seven Thunders had uttered their
[2:48:24] voices I was about to write and I I
[2:48:28] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying to me
[2:48:31] seal up those things which the seven
[2:48:33] Thunders uttered I want you to see
[2:48:35] something here there are seven seals
[2:48:37] right
[2:48:39] there right seal up those things seven
[2:48:44] Thunder Vo vo is sealed up Seven
[2:48:47] Seals what's now and I Heard a Voice
[2:48:50] from Heaven saying let me seal up those
[2:48:52] things with the seven Thunders UT and
[2:48:54] write them not and the angel which I saw
[2:48:57] stand upon the sea upon the Earth lifted
[2:48:59] up his hand to Heaven swear by him that
[2:49:01] lives forever who created heaven the
[2:49:02] things that therein are and the earth
[2:49:04] and the things which are therein are and
[2:49:06] the Sea and the things which are therein
[2:49:08] that there should be time no
[2:49:12] longer and actually if you look at the
[2:49:16] translation it says that there would be
[2:49:18] no more
[2:49:20] delay because God was
[2:49:24] delaying the understanding of this voice
[2:49:27] of God until the last
[2:49:31] days and then he says but now wait a
[2:49:35] minute it says up here in verse 5 or be
[2:49:40] verse six try it again no verse four
[2:49:44] seal up the the things with those seven
[2:49:45] Thunders UT and write them not and then
[2:49:48] explains that he declared though it
[2:49:51] wouldn't always remain
[2:49:53] closed so he lifts up his hand to heaven
[2:49:56] and swears there's going to come a time
[2:50:00] when I'm not going to hold this back any
[2:50:03] longer when there the people on the
[2:50:06] Earth to possess the land of promise who
[2:50:10] are going to go into their
[2:50:13] inheritance and when does what is going
[2:50:16] to happen seal it up now watch and
[2:50:20] there's coming a Time there'll be no
[2:50:21] more delay
[2:50:23] but in the days of the
[2:50:27] voice you
[2:50:29] know I think brother Aaron is a pretty
[2:50:31] good fellow
[2:50:37] but I think brother Joe does pretty good
[2:50:40] with his money
[2:50:42] but I think David but is
[2:50:45] a he works does a has an important job
[2:50:49] at the hospital
[2:50:51] but wonder what's coming
[2:50:56] after you never start a complete thought
[2:50:59] with
[2:51:01] butt but I love brother
[2:51:13] Joe
[2:51:17] but you don't start a complete thought
[2:51:20] with but people pull this one scripture
[2:51:23] right out and they start with
[2:51:25] but and they believe this part here but
[2:51:29] but
[2:51:31] what but what seven Thunders have been
[2:51:35] sealed up that's and I'm telling you you
[2:51:39] know don't write it
[2:51:43] but
[2:51:45] but in the days of the voice of the
[2:51:48] seventh angel when he starts sounding
[2:51:51] his message this mystery this
[2:51:56] mystery will no longer be a secret I'm
[2:52:00] going to make it known to an end time
[2:52:02] people so they will hear the voice of
[2:52:06] God for the last days to know they are
