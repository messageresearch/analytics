here this morning lord because i have needs in my life i have need of greater revelation lord well quicken your word to me this morning oh my let's just go before the lord in prayer heavenly father how we love you and we thank you for all that you have done for us lord just to think that you paid the price that we could never pay when you stretched forth your arms there on calvary and you said it is finished lord you paid the penalty for our sin lord when we should have been the one there lord you loved us we're in this great love lord that you've showed to us and we just want to tell you that we love you lord we thank you lord jesus we just want to surrender our thoughts and our ideas lord and just lay it all down at your feet this morning and ask that you would come now lord that you would break the bread of life as only you can lord we just surrender ourselves to you now god we just pray a blessing upon our precious brother tim and brother timothy and sister ruth as their way that you would be their portion lord god may your angels just be encamped about them to keep them safe on the roads lord we just pray a special blessing upon your people that have come to the house of god and those that haven't been able to make it maybe many are online streaming lord we pray that you'd be their portion now we ask all these blessings in your name the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord my if you just want to grab your bibles we'll be reading out of first john chapter 4 as you're doing that we just want to bring you greetings from our pastor brother david mcgeary in bedford texas at christian life tabernacle and the saints there we certainly love each of you and just hold you dear to our hearts and and also we we just are humbled by the invitation by brother tim just to be able to serve in his absence and stand before you it's we don't take it lightly but it's a great responsibility to stand before the redeemed purchase of almighty god you're special you're the ones he died for you are his victory yes sir you're the proof of his resurrection you're the proof of the message oh when you hear words like that you are his victory well behold i send you elijah there had to be a you to receive the message of elijah and the very proof of the message that elijah brought is the ones that have received it come on the ones that are standing here this morning in the face of all opposition and declaring that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever oh my what a blessed people we are amen my praise the lord amen just maybe in settling myself just to tell you that uh we we've come to know brother tim and the family and just hold them really dear to our hearts we started to serve the lord and in december of 1999 and from that time we would come over to be in fellowship with the saints here and brother tim and and my uh i cherish the uh some of those early years i'd come over and brother tim would take me to some goat shows so his goats could show this little city boy around the arena and uh you know some of his prized goats received best of show for for uh showing a little city boy what it was like to to to go into a goat show and into the country and i just look back on those little times of fellowship we had and and how much they've meant to me down through the ages and down through the time and you look back and you reflect on it and my life seems to get busy and and you get a family and you don't maybe have the the the ability to travel or take the time out like you used to but my you certainly cherish those and so we're just so thankful to be here we're just reading out of john uh first john chapter four and be reading to you uh verse one through four out of first john four verses one through four and it reads here it says beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whither they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is the spirit of the antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world year of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen and let's also just read out of revelations chapter 3 and verse 20 and 21 it says behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and set down with my father and his throne amen you may be seated we ask a blessing upon the reading of the word brother branham would take this these texts these scriptures and he would preach the message called how can i overcome and my what a what a statement how can i overcome i mean when you read the title there's something in my heart that says lord i want to overcome how can i overcome and i think this is very profound here as the prophet would read these texts and he would say i want to take my subject this morning of this how can i overcome now i chose this because that i think it's a time that we should never let the spirit of revival die we've got to keep in revival constantly revived every day paul said he had to die daily that christ could live and we must never let the revival die within us oh my here here's the question how can i overcome i mean that's a good question concerning the day and age that we're living in you know the pressure of the age the nervous tension the always uh reaching for riches enough is never enough oh my does anybody know what i'm talking about it seems like there's just a constant pressure to do more to have more uh to go more places and and why you could even uh maybe have nice things and you can have a nice car and a nice career but mine just seems like there's a pressure on the age and a nervous tension that's that's always a pressure in you to to have more and to do more and and listen to what the prophet is saying here he says we've got to keep in revival constantly revived every day constantly revived every day so not just sunday not just wednesday not during the special services but every day we got to be constantly revived because god is wanting to have fellowship with you god is wanting to have communion with you now and it's not just in the sunday service it's not just in the wednesday service but oh we got to stay constantly revived we got to be in a relationship constantly walking with the lord in a revival now maybe god did something for you maybe on a saturday night and god came by and touched you and he did something specific for you there but as i thought about that you know there came a time that i'd given a promise to my wife and i said i'm i'm going to come to ohio and i'm going to marry you and it happened to be on a saturday where we went before the altar we made our vows and we were married but you know what i didn't leave her at the altar it was a saturday but i came there with a purpose and i came there to marry her because i wanted to spend the rest of my life with her and i want to tell you when god comes by your way and he touches you in a specific way and maybe it was on a friday night maybe it was on a saturday night maybe it'll be in a sunday morning service god is not touching you to leave you there at the altar but god is wanting to become one flesh with you he's wanting you to be born of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life and power of his power god means business [Applause] he didn't come to just touch you and be a one-time thing but god has a purpose that he is wanting to do in your life and he's wanting to live with you he's wanting to be in communion with you he's wanting you to be lived constantly in revival every single day he said i will never leave you nor forsake you but i'll be with you even in you until the end of the world the prophet would say something along these lines that god pouring his spirit out into you he said not just one baptism not one little baptism of baptism after baptism he said not a revelation of justification not a revelation of sanctification not a revelation of the pouring out of the gifts and the pouring out of the spirit but he said revelation after revelation and power after power and glory after glory that is what god is wanting to enter in with you is a relationship where he's constantly every day revealing himself to you and speaking to you lifting you up guiding you oh that's the kind of relationship that god is wanting to have with this bride here in the end time well it's not just for the sunday night service it's not just for the wednesday night service it's not just for the camp meetings but god is wanting to live in a union with you every single day all that you can feel this presence that you can feel the power of god and then it'd be so real for you you might go through some time you might go through some dry spells where you don't feel them you don't know that uh you can't feel his presence but something has happened something has been quickened there is a seed that has come alive and in the face of the whole adversary in the face of the enemy when it seems like everything is going wrong and all hell is breaking loose you can stand right there in the face of the enemy say i know my redeemer living why i met him he came to me he revealed himself to me oh greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world oh those that hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled the prophet goes on to say here and how can i overcome so if we are trying to follow the message of the hour or at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the life of christ see because if you don't you lay around and know that these things that you're supposed to do and you don't do it oh now the lord's talking to somebody if he ain't talking to you he's talking to me he says we should live constantly in the life of christ see because if you don't you lay around and know that these things that you're supposed to do and don't do it the bible said that he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin then you become doty rotten and you're separated from the life of god so strive with all that's in you to stay in the life of christ that you would be fruit-bearing now we wonder why many times in our life we're not bearing the fruits of christ it's because we're not doing the things that we know we should do well that's pretty simple brother matthew yes and it's a simple truth that we need to take to heart and be obedient to the word of god and there's things that the pastor and the ministry here will deal with and they'll preach at over and over and you'll hear those things and maybe you'll adhere to do it one time or two time or you do good for a week or two weeks or maybe three months but god is wanting to call you to more than that he's wanting to call you into a life as an overcomer where those things are dead to you they don't tip you anymore and if they do tempt you you don't let that thought roost there in your mind but you look to the word that you might have the victory over it oh my maybe god is going to work in your life and maybe the things of the world they don't have a pull on you but you know it can be in the simple things where where god is calling us to a life of prayer and we know that god has told you over and over that you just feel like in your heart you know i need to get up early in the morning and i need to spend at least 30 45 minutes reading my bible and being in prayer in the presence of god that i could just start out my day in a sweet communion with the lord and you know that the lord has been dealing with you in those things and you wonder why you've been in frustration you wonder why the atmosphere in your home hasn't been just quite quite right and you wonder why you're not bearing the fruits in your life that you should be bearing it could be simply that god is just wanting you to be obedient to that still small voice that is calling you into prayer or calling you to a fellowship and you know to do those things oh brother matthew this doesn't sound like some big deep revelation well if we're not being faithful to the little things just like the prophet always said how in the world am i going to teach you algebra if you won't learn your abcs oh my we live in an age of such pressure and demand on the flesh and the time that we're living in i wonder if we were to calculate it all up and if we were to add it how many times you're on the internet versus how many hours you spend in prayer how many times are you looking at these other things of the world and i'm not even saying they have to be sin it could be talking to friends it could be talking to loved ones it could be shopping it could be uh looking to buy things you know there's so much in this world now to entertain you there's so much in you to build your portfolio and to pin this here and to like this and to follow this and you find out that if you're not careful you're on some of these social media platforms and you know what everybody else is doing but you don't even know what the lord god is doing in your own life i know where so and so is i know where they're on vacation i know where they went to all i know about those church meetings over there and then you find out that in your own life you're not bearing the fruits of christ because so you're so involved with everybody else's life and now the word of the lord is coming and telling you that you've got to constantly remain in the life of christ constantly being in revival god help us to be faithful in these little things we're talking about being an overcomer oh because if you just lay around and you don't do these things you become doty you become rotten and often you find yourself in a position or making a decision or something like that and you wonder like how did i even get here i thought i was past this i thought i was beyond this and oh then the devil starts to heap on that that condemnation and that conviction onto your life because you start to question oh do i really have it you start to question your experience with god because oh what did the prophet say the devil has a punch coming and if we're not guarding ourselves well how do you guard yourself brother matthew oh you guard yourself by the word of god being obedient to the word of god staying in prayer staying in fellowship staying in the word oh paul would say it like this he'd say this i say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh of church we need to get in the spirit if you walk in the spirit you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh that's right oh the prophet of god said when you get in the spirit then you see the vision i was like well you see the vision what are you talking about well the prophet said that the vision is the word of the lord and the word of the lord comes to the prophet therefore this message is the very vision for your life the word says where there is no vision that people perish god has not left you without a vision god has not left you without a purpose god hasn't left the bride here wondering what's going on or what's going to happen where did i come from where did i go but god has revealed the whole secret purpose of his mind to the bride of jesus christ and she knows where she's standing she has the mind of god she has thus saith the lord or she stands still come on now oh we're talking about being overcomers about living in the spirit the prophet would say that overcome means to recognize the devil and every single one of his tricks but he didn't leave it there there's a lot of people that can recognize the devil they can recognize the silent times that we're living and they can look out there and and see the political scene and the sickness and everything that's in the land and they can recognize the devil is on a tear well they can point it out and look at how corrupt everything is but he said an overcome means to recognize that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so yes you might recognize the devil in all of his tricks but we got to recognize and have a revelation to know that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world the prophet would go on to say this we see this age that we're living in it's one of the grandest ages of all ages this lady you'll see a church age is the grandest of all the church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of eternity and then it's the greatest sinful age it's more sin in this age than there's ever been well i'm not going to debate that nor would i ever debate with the prophet right not to go on a tangent but it's funny how some people can it's more sin in this age than there ever been and the powers of satan is many times harder to fight against than it was in any age now we're looking at our text here it says to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me and my throne even as i also overcame well to be an overcomer you have to have something to overcome [Music] to be an overcomer you have to have something to overcome and here the prophet is showing us that the age that we're living in there's never been an age with more sin there's never been an age that has had such darkness upon it he said the the power of satan is harder to fight against than it was in any age that there ever was oh my it makes me think of the the prophet isaiah there in uh uh chapter 61 verse two and he say in gross darkness upon the land and gross darkness upon the people the prophet would pick that up and say that is a prophecy concerning the day and age that we're living in and he would tie that scripture there in the beginning of how the world laid there in darkness and chaos he said the earth was without form and it was without void but oh underneath all of that chaos underneath all of that darkness that was laying there there was a spoken word seed that was laying there and something had this transpired in the midst of all of that darkness for the seed and that life that was laying there on the bottom of all of that chaos and all of that darkness and the scripture would read like this it would say that and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light oh i see oh god may the spirit of god move upon me move upon my life move upon my chaos move upon my family move upon my friends live upon my family lord move upon my day from waking to envy lord i want to constantly live in revival oh god may your spirit move upon me oh we see all the darkness we see all the chaos out there but in that same scripture what does it say arise and shine for thy light has come it says gross darkness upon the land and gross darkness upon the people but the prophet ties that together with ezekiel or zechariah 14 he says that in the evening time oh there's going to be a day that's neither day or night he said it's because of the presence of the darkness and the presence of the light that makes it a day that's neither day or night but he said in the evening time oh it shall be light you don't have to worry and fret because of the condition of the world you don't have to worry about these uh diseases and things that are going through the world you don't have to be sitting there and wondering about your job am i ever going to be able to pay my bills am i ever going to be able to afford this or for that you're allowing the nervous tension of the age to pressing upon you but there is a message that is shining the gospel light that's saying arise and shine you are not called to be part of the darkness you are not called to be part of ladies here but god has called you out of the darkness he has called you to lie the message of the hour has come to quicken that seed inside of you and bring you forth alive oh thank god that the gospel light is shining in its full strength and power thank you jesus oh glory to god you don't have to be up and down you don't have to be in and out you got an anchor oh sure you might have trials you might have uh persecutions and disappointments and heartaches sickness and pain come on does anybody know what i'm talking about oh but there's an anchor there we're gonna have trials we're gonna have sickness we're gonna have pain but is that gonna discourage you from serving the lord are you gonna back up are you gonna quit well i was fellowship with brother aaron about that song i have decided to follow jesus oh my you know when you when you find out the meaning behind the songs you're singing oh it can it can well a well spring up inside of you oh it's about 150 years ago after the welsh revival had broken out there were some american baptist ministers uh they wanted to spread the gospel and so they went into the northeast part of india there and they were going to to spread the gospel into the tribes and uh you know those the tribal indians there they were they were primitive and they were very territorial and and then i believe it was the assam tribes up there in that region that they wanted to come into well i'm going to tell it and i don't know how they would get up in that region there and and these missionary baptists wanted to to preach the gospel of jesus christ a god of love a god of forgiveness and one of these missionaries had success he had found a family and this man he he was married and had two boys and he accepted jesus christ as a savior and he was living there in his tribe and and all of a sudden you know he that god was moving in his life and and he started to have an effect on the other people in his community and actually other people started to receive the gospel they started to believe on the lord jesus christ and it caused such a stir in the tribe and the community that the chief he called him and said hey come here and they had a town meeting right they said you're causing a lot of raucous you're kind of a lot of nonsense and he took this man this is a true story i'm told he took this man and his wife and his two kids and set them there before the city and said you must renounce your faith in jesus christ he said or i will kill you and his response as the holy ghost moved upon him he said i have decided to follow jesus and there the chief had given the signal and there the archers sent forth their ball and it struck both of his sons there and they fell over laying on their ground and they were twitching there in front of him and the chief looked at him and he said now i'll give you another chance to renounce your faith and jesus christ or your wife is next and the man standing there he looked up and said vo none go with me still i will follow and there the arrow struck his own wife and she was laying there and the chief looked at him and said i'll give you one chance more to renounce your faith in this jesus and there the man standing there in the face of death he said the cross before me the world behind me no turning back oh and as the story goes and arrow struck him and he laid down there and he died with his family you say what's the point of the of the story brother matthew well there's several points we can gain from it but that's man's devotion to his faith there struck that indian chief he sat there and thought how can a man allow his whole family to go by the way of the grave he thought this faith in jesus christ must be something real and he sought after it and he said i too will be a follower of jesus christ and the chief in the presence of the whole community fell down there and actually received the word in that hour jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i wonder if we in the face of death can say as this man maybe in the face of your friends maybe in the face of your colleagues maybe you're at work and and people are are saying things just to try to get at you and they're they're trying to to see what you believe and they're trying to pull it out at you and maybe you're just being a little reluctantly you're like well maybe if i tell them exactly what i believe you know they're not going to befriend me anymore but i wonder if there's a life if there's a spirit inside of you that could say like this man that can say i have decided to follow jesus oh the cross before me the world behind me there's no turning back i want to tell you i made a decision a long time ago there's no turning back i'm going to come too far the devil's going to try to put you down he's going to try to put out that spirit of revival that's living inside of you people oh but you have made your decision why don't you just go ahead tell the devil there's no turning back i've come too far he's already done way too much for me oh hallelujah let's walk before me the world brightly there's no turning back oh get a good look at some people that are overcoming and lady garcia in the face of their jobs in the face of their friends in the face of adversity they're gonna tell that old devil i won't turn back oh come on somebody i'm talking about the spirit of revival i'm talking about the spirit of god the fire god shut up in your bones oh glory no turning back thank you jesus oh hallelujah this ain't no fairy tale this ain't a fake gospel my god is real oh how do you know israel i feel them in my soul oh glory to god ain't no turning back church i have decided to follow jesus oh in the face of adversity in the face of torment in the face of being brokenhearted i have decided yeah you know i i was under a little juniper tree if i could just be honest with you this week and i was just thinking about how maybe the way things are and maybe how things could be different and just maybe things that have transpired over the last few years you know and i started feeling down and i started feeling a little discouraged you know and and here you know god's puts a message on my heart the spirit of revival well all right the spirit of revival i was like well lord i need some reviving myself lord i need something to raise up within me lord i'm feeling a little down and i just i started thinking there in the word you know what did david do yeah david was discouraged one time and i was looking at that you know david had a lot more to be discouraged about than i did there he's coming back from the battle of ziklag there and he's coming back and and no no doubt as they're coming down the trail there they can see the smoke and the fire coming up and no doubt just their energy spent from being in battle and here they come to where uh their homes were and their families and their kids and everything has been taken everything is gone and his own men those mighty men that fought with david they were so grieved and so vets that they were even starting to speak of stoning david and here david all of his friends all of the ones he fought in battle with all the ones he had gone to church and had church service with and they'd sat with him on the front row and he was just wondering how am i going to make it another day the very ones that i've preached the meetings with they're talking about stoning me they're trying to kill my character they're trying to tell me i should have never led them to the battle we should have never went this way david it's all your fault that's the reason why we're in this mess and there david oh he's discouraged but oh we can learn a great principle of this david the scripture says encouraged himself in the lord david said now where's that he fought at go ahead and bring me the ephod i want to know what god says about it oh i believe that ought to be the heart cry of the believer if you're discouraged or you're going through something i want to tell you you want to find out what does god say about it what does god say about my condition what does god say about it you are not cast down you are not defeated what can separate you from the love of god if god before us who can be against us always that he will work all things out to the good to those who love god and are called according to this purpose well if i could encourage you with anything i want to tell you good's coming yes oh maybe you're in your darkest trial you have a broken heart you don't know how you're going to make it another day oh but i want to be like david did i want to look into the word of god i want to say what is god saying god god says good's coming he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you but i'll be with you i'll even be with you until the end of the work good is coming oh my god is good he's real and he has something special in store for you oh you can encourage your heart you can comfort your heart with these words to know that jesus christ has your best interest in mind jesus would say it like this in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world oh greater is he that is in you oh let that sink down now greater is he that is in you the scripture would say something like this don't go out there and look for the kingdom way off somewhere jesus said don't go out there and look for the kingdom where is the kingdom of god the kingdom of god is within you oh you want to know why you can constantly live in revival oh come on church you can live in revival every day because jesus christ the kingdom of heaven the word of god has made its abode right there in your heart oh thank you jesus oh my how can i overcome god has called you to be an overcomer and the scriptures would say like this in matthew 3 11 you say i indeed baptize you with water under repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i oh look i can baptize you the brothers can baptize you you can be baptized by good church services but he that cometh after me is mightier than i he that cometh after me is mightier than i we want to build on our experience church we want to build on the word of god that's being revealed in our lives and know that god has more force maybe you've come to a place of justification maybe you've come to a place of sanctification but god is wanting to baptize you with the holy ghost he says but he that cometh after me is mightier than i oh he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and fire i was just dwelling on that oh i just love the principle of fire brother branham tells that story about the little turtle right he said he got a hold of that turtle and he wanted to make that turtle move so what did he do he started to beat it with the willow stick he started to tell that little turtle hey this is how you ought to dress you shouldn't cut your hair you should wear long dresses you shouldn't wear splits in them you know you should go to church on sunday and wednesday starting to give the message to it lay it over to that turtle over and over and over and as long as he laid that out to that turtle that turtle wouldn't even move well maybe i'll take the turtle on down to the water i'll go ahead and baptize it in the water i'll go take it down to some meetings i'll go ahead and get it in the atmosphere and i'll just see if i can get this turtle to move and he went down there and he dunked the turtle in the water and pulled it out but nothing would move that turtle he just was sank back in that shell oh but i like how he tells a story you know then i got the idea i went to go ahead and build me a little fire under it and when i built that little fire and i set that turtle on top of that fire all of a sudden he began to move oh you don't have to beg it to go to church you ain't got to plead with him to go to church you ain't got to tell her how to dress right you ain't got to tell her how to act right there is a fire that is shut up in your pose that's causing you to act right it's causing you to talk right it's causing you to refute the devil on any stance he'll take against you and tell him that this message is true i'm not backing up i'm not giving way oh there's a fire in me there's a spirit of revival it wasn't given to me by my mama it wasn't given to me by my daddy it wasn't given to me my church it wasn't giving me to myself campground oh many times when you think about a revival maybe you start to think about the camp services we've had some mighty camps we've had some mighty special meetings power of god moved down amongst us oh we witnessed the supernatural but you know when when the lights are shut off and everybody's gone home where's the spirit of revival then where is the fire of god then it's a good question to ask where is the fire but he that cometh after me is mightier than i he shall baptize you with the holy ghost in fire of the very life of god oh my i'm thankful for the atmosphere that god creates when his people get together things can happen people are wondering what has happened to these people why are the people acting different what what's what's causing all this ruckus why are these young people giving their lives to god why they're renouncing all the things of the world it's because they've got fire in them there's a spirit of revival that's broke out in them there's something that's changed and there's something that made makes them different i'm not talking about some strange fire like in leviticus 10 where where the priest offered some strange fire before the lord the prophet of god said that's denominational fire this ain't no denominational fire this is the power of god to transform a life this is that great ish oh in sunlight that would shine down upon a predestinated seed and bring all the potentials that was lying in the seed to the manifestation of what god called it to be that's what we're seeing in this hour we're ripening in the presence of the sun and we're seeing sons and daughters coming into their position coming into the maturity and manifested the word that has been spoken by malachi 4 5 that's what this is all about this is the word take it on flesh the prophet of god would say this he would say you call for revivals you wait for your church to have a revival well that ain't the revival for you the revival ought to begin right in you when you begin to thirst for god there might not be another member of the church wanting the revival it breaks out in you and if it breaks out of you he says it'll break out in other places oh my praise god if it breaks out in you it'll break out in other places what does that mean i'm not talking about an event i'm not talking about a church building i'm not talking about a place where revival started but i'm talking about a people the bible says the angel of the lord and campeth round about them that fear him and deliver them oh i'm talking about the purchase blood pot redeemed saints of almighty god oh you say brother matthew how dare you say the angel of the lord is here that was reversed special for the prophet no i'm quoting the bible the bible said i want to ask you this morning do you believe the bible do you believe the word of the god it says the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and deliver them that means the angel of the lord is here oh come on the prophet of god said god still sends his men with the angel before them to prepare the way oh you want to wonder why we have such a good time you want to wonder why there's a revival you want to wonder why why because the angel of the lord is here the angels are here and camping around about the saints of god oh hallelujah it ain't the church building that brought the angel come on now it ain't the church building that brought the revival it ain't the campground that brought the angel it's god's people getting together and a divine promise from almighty god that said where two or three are gathered there i'll be in their midst oh what do you expect to happen you're there in the presence of almighty god what do you expect to happen when the angel of the lord comes what do you expect to happen when jesus christ shows up on the scene and he means business oh come on now people will be in bondage they'll be set free people are being bonded to pornography they'll be set free people will be sick they will be delivered wow because that's a divine promise from almighty god oh that's why it's not because what i've done it's all because of what he's done that's the reason for it oh praise god he said these signs shall follow them that belief oh in my name they shall cast out devils they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover oh praise god that's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever what are you talking about brother matthew i'm saying the same angel the same god who led the children of israel by a pillar of fire and a cloud by day is here this morning amen the same jesus who was walking down the street one time and the crowd was all around him and people were throwing it upon him and touching them all sudden jesus stopped and said who touched me who touched me the disciples are wondering what do you mean lord who touched you there's people everywhere he said no i perceive virtue has gone from me and there was a lady who had had a blood issue i believe for 12 years that had reached out and touched the hem of his garment and she was healed well that's what i'm saying i'm saying the same jesus the same jesus christ is here right now so then what about your problem what about your sickness what about your trial what about your discouragement i'm telling you jesus christ is passing by well if we can just have a faith in our heart now to take god at his word and say oh my maybe i've been in a lot of services before maybe i've been but tonight's this morning's my time this is my turn i'm going to reach out i'm going to touch the end of his garment because i've heard the word go forth and it says that the angel of the lord is here that he encampeth round about those that fear it and he delivereth them that means my god is in the building so whenever you and i meet him i'm asking i'm telling somebody whatever you have needed this morning why don't you just go ahead and claim it why don't you just go ahead and accept it why don't you just go ahead and reach out because jesus christ is passing by your way oh the same god that part of the red sea the same god that spoke to elijah said i have commanded a widow woman to sustain thee hear a widow woman about to make two cakes and die this story don't even make sense what do you mean you've commanded a woman to sustain my life who doesn't even know she's been commanded and doesn't even have the substance to sustain me the same god that could command a widow woman who is about to eat two cakes and die to sustain a prophet is the same god i'm talking about when the prophet come down there and said oh give me something to drink and now she turned away maybe she could have handled that but go ahead and bring me a cake first oh but what do you mean see she didn't even realize she was part of the predestinated plan of god she didn't even realize that the word had already commanded her to sustain the prophet's message oh come on now you didn't even know that you were laying here lady elsia there was a seed of god that he had planted but god had commanded these stones god had commanded these seeds you wouldn't even know that you were called by god you didn't even know that you were elected and you were chosen but the word of god had prophesied the word of god had been spoken and the word went forth and there is a pride to receive that word and all of a sudden she said all right nonetheless i will give it to you first oh and that's what the bride of jesus christ is doing although none go with me still i will follow i will give my whole heart to this message i'll follow with everything that's within me if my daddy falls away so be it if my mommy falls away so be it if my church falls away i'm not giving up i'm not backing up i have decided to follow jesus i am going on with god i'll keep believing them until the chains of my body and if i go into the grave i'm coming out again because the spirit of revival is shown up in my bones oh glory to god hallelujah it's not i'd have heaven but christ liveth in me praise the lord glory to god oh hallelujah if that same spirit church that raised up jesus christ from the dead dwell in you it shall quicken your mortal body it shall quicken your mortal body that ain't just limited to the grave but when you get that quickening power on you oh my something begins to happen it begins to change the way that you act it begins to change the way that you think it becomes to change the way that you talk does anybody know what i'm talking about oh i've been there i've been there all the spirit of god if it dwell in you it shall quicken your mortal bodies the prophet would say this out of perfect faith he was saying now we become anointed with that same spirit anointed messiahs messiahs of the last day to shine forth the resurrection of jesus christ to show that he is not dead but in the form of the holy ghost he's in his people moving among his bride with a love affair to her pouring out into her himself they are becoming one for the wedding supper the same signs promised by the same god and the same word is making the same manifestations oh praise god church you have been anointed this is a reality this ain't a hope so message i'm not i'm not wondering abraham wasn't wondering if he was going to have a promised son he was expecting the promised son the bride is not wondering she's expecting why because she's been impregnated with the word we have received the word in this hour oh what did the prophet say he said here is the secret here is the secret the word is in the bride as it was in mary what you ever think about that he's speaking to you here is the secret the word is in you as it was in mary that means that word that is in you is going to bring forth none other than jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever well how did it get there how did it get there all i know is that when the angel came to mary and told her the message she said be it unto me according to thy word thou art highly favored among women god has placed his word seed inside of it of you you don't have to struggle with that church you don't have to wonder you don't have to wonder if you're in or out or is that is the message for me god placed that word inside of you oh he chose you before the foundation of the world he elected you he called you he placed his word in there and what he's wanting you to do is say lord be it unto me according to thy word oh maybe you say brother matthew you don't understand i you've you've come to you've come too late i've made too many mistakes i've fallen this spirit of revival you're talking about i was living in revival i had it in my life and i see people rejoicing in the presence of the lord and i want to get back into the presence i want to get i want to get my life right but i've just missed my opportunity you know it kind of reminds me of when i was a little boy i was at some some camp services it's a place down in dry creek louisiana maybe some of y'all have heard about it they have some camp services down there and and i had an experience with the lord but i had come back from that and though i had an experience and i i had felt the presence and something had taken place i knew it was real but i came back and i didn't feed the fire i didn't i didn't feed the fire and i found out after a little bit a while that you know that that revival fire had went out but i'm so thankful for that god never gave up on me but god was waiting there until i would come to that time of a full surrender and i want to just be a word of encouragement to you god has not given up on you maybe you're sitting in this church service right now and you're feeling all alone and you feel like you missed your chance and you missed your opportunity but i'm giving you the word of the lord to tell you that you haven't missed your chance you haven't missed your opportunity god has not given up on you he's just wanting you to accept him he's just wanting you to take him out of your way he's oh but what about all my faults brother matthew what about all my failures what about all the things that i've done what does the scripture say therefore is now no condemnation to them who are in christ jesus oh my bible tells me sin will not have dominion over you i want to encourage you i don't care how far you've fallen god said sin will not have dominion over you that is the reason he died at calvary he paid the penalty for that sin so that you don't have to keep living in condemnation oh it's not too late this is the time this is the hour that god is calling you he's wanting to revive you he's wanting that spirit of revival to come upon your life and put you in action oh don't let the devil beat you up about your past you're not alone god's here for you you say oh i bet i missed you i missed my chest no look i don't care where you're at in your walk the word tells us that only the elect can be reborn right the prophet of god says that in the church book he says in non-seed there's nothing to be quickened so i don't care where you're at god placed that seed here is the secret the word is in you as it was in mary there is something that god is wanting to quicken inside of you if you can just forsake your faults forsake your failures forsake your own ideas forsake whatever it is that's holding you back why don't you just go ahead and get the victory this morning and say once and for all i'm going to lay it all down lord jesus i know that i gave up on you but you never gave up on me and right now i'm going to turn my heart back to you god and say i'm coming lord i'm coming with everything that's in me oh just fill me with that spirit of god set my heart on fire let the spirit of god revival break out on me oh and i know if it breaks out in me it'll break out in other places it'll break out in my family it might break out in my job it might break out of my school but oh god just set me on fire lord let me be living in the spirit of god oh constantly living in revival oh it's for you church you can have it the scripture says and be not drunk with wine wearing an access but be filled with the spirit oh i like how it runs off of that it says be not drunk with wine well the next statement is saying we're in an access but be filled with the spirit that means there's some stimulation of this revelation oh you ever seen a drunk man i was staying at a hotel not too long ago i saw some guy walking through the parking lot and my goodness gracious he couldn't even walk a straight line but he couldn't even he couldn't even make it there he was trying oh my he he was having a fit but you want to know what he was on his own little world there had an intoxication had come over him something had grabbed a hold of his life he wasn't even aware of his surroundings come on there's a spirit of god that can strike you it'll make you talk different it'll make you active you won't even worry about the world around you something will just break out in you you start walking different you're still acting different you are talking different why because it's the spirit of god you might start screaming you might start shouting you might start running oh but you're not worried about it wow where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty there is liberty in the house of god this morning there is liberty why did you praise him why don't you regard people oh hallelujah redeemed on the lord's side so it'll make you act different it'll make you talk different oh i have decided to follow jesus oh praise this wonderful man hallelujah glory hallelujah well the devil keeps trying to tell me i'm just trying to work up the people you're just trying to work up the people you're just trying to get them all excited oh my you know there's a spirit out there that wants to kill your influence there's a spirit out there that wants to kill this revival that's why the word of the lord is coming to you and it's saying don't let that spirit of revival die why because the devil hates it why because you're tormenting demons you're shaking the walls of hell because he knows someday in a moment in a twinkling of an eye there's going to be a people that are changed you're going to put death under your feet it'll be swallowed up in victory oh great where is your victory oh death where is your skin hallelujah glory why don't you praise the lord hallelujah oh glory you can't be shut up church you're going to be taken up you can't be shut up you're going up oh praise the lord the prophet of god would say this hallelujah he said it takes the spirit of god to bring life and that life must not come out of just the intellectual revival well glory to god brother aaron you're telling me you can have an intellectual revival i guess you can the prophet just said it he said the life must not come out of just the intellectual revival you know there's a whole lot of kind of revivals out there but the bride is interested in just one kind of revival there's only one revival the bride is interested in he said it got to come out of the bible word revival and that word is the same yesterday today and forever and when it falls today it quickens you get the same results you did in acts 2 always has and always will be because it's the spirit of god that conditions the atmosphere oh glory to god oh my stick around a little bit there's an atmosphere here it takes the atmosphere to do things that's the reason you men are always taught bring your children here well certainly that's right i was glad to see my daughter rebecca come in and sit down just a few minutes ago some of you seen me wink out a woman it was my daughter so she come in and sat down now listen to this is the prophet listen what he's saying here he's saying i want her to receive the baptism of the spirit and that's why she is here in the meeting that's the purpose of it it takes atmosphere well people can go on and criticize they can go ahead and call us fanatics they can call us holy rollers but my prophet told me that it takes atmosphere to bring forth a birth and when you get god's people together and they start singing the praises of almighty god and you know that by divine promise the angel of god is in the building now just for a little side note here you know the devil always wants to cause you to to doubt the word of god what do you mean brother matthew the angel the lord is in the building you know there's a bunch of y'all having church all over the world how can the angel of the lord be in every place at the same time well i just got to thinking about it well like you know devil i mean i see maybe your reasoning point but i just thought you know i'm gonna look up and see how fast light travels and i looked it up and it said that in one second light can travel around the world seven and a half times and one second and i thought my certainly the one who created light can travel a whole lot faster than light so if it takes one second come on now if it takes one second for light to travel around the world seven and a half times oh god just needs a second he just needs a millisecond he'll flash this way or flash that way he'll come right down to your aisle right down your pew and he'll touch you and in a moment you'll be changed in a moment you'll be different all things will pass away all things will become new why just one moment in his presence everything will be different that's the god i serve oh my just a little bit of atmosphere all things are possible you realize right now where you're sitting you're sitting in the presence in an atmosphere where all things are possible well as we opened up the service the prophet is saying not just a revelation but revelation after revelation this is a word revival why do we purpose in our heart lord jesus i know you're not done with me i know you have more for me let's start being an expectation for the word to continue to unfold deeper and deeper greater and greater one baptism after another many baptisms many refillings revelation after revelations paul said i came not to you with enticing words of man's wisdom but in power and demonstration right that's what we're talking about power and demonstration of the word just moving towards a close here really quick the word says in john 6 63 it says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life he said brother matthew what are you talking about what's moving this revival it's not an intellectual revival it's not an emotional revival oh sure if we just came to church and all we did was work up an atmosphere and and all we did is get a bunch of people excited then what then what are we doing yeah maybe we're just having an intellectual revival maybe we're just having a little bit of an emotional revival but all there is a people who have given the word first place in their life they have given the word preeminence and it is a word revival the bible says in matthew 24 27 it says for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall the coming of the son of man be for wheresoever the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered oh that's what we're gathered around we're gathered around the revealed word of the hour the prophet would say there in the first seal he says oh there's coming a messenger that's going to take all the loose ends he's going to tie him all together and what is it going to do it's going to reveal the whole secret of god and it's going to gather the bride together for the rapture for rapturing faith and then he comes there in the third seal and he says oh the bride has i had no revival yet here this is 1963's he's preaching the third seal he says the bride hasn't had no revival yet he says it's going to take those seven unknown thunders to wake her up this is 1963 oh the bride hasn't had no revival yet it's going to take those seven unknown thunders to wake her up and then he comes in in 1964 preaching recognizing your day in its message and he says all the church seeing the church world they're out there praying fast and pray fast and pray for some great awakening but what does the prophet say he says they have missed it they have not recognized the awakening of the bride they have not recognized the awaking of the bridal they didn't recognize the opening of the word that's what this revival is about this revival is about the word that has been opened up to us in this day the third pool the revealing of those seven seals that had your name on the book and it's called your name that's what this revival is about this is the bride's revival this ain't about going back to another age this is about going into a rapture this is about going into a body change this is about recognizing who you are in your position in the revealed word of the hour oh that'll cause a revival oh hallelujah we've got to get down into that word feed on it the prophet said if you want deity in your midst welcome and receive the word oh how many years say lord i want to welcome and receive the word hallelujah amen we'll just come to a close if the musicians would come oh praise the lord the prophet would say this he says in recognizing your day and its message he says the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upward the spirit of god which is the word of god my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in christ we'll put her in her place no national force will do it but national force did drive israel to her homeland the national force of council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of god will raise the bride into glory and out of it oh aren't you thankful for
