with believers amen and to see you here with us today is a special honor for you to be with us and um I wanted just to um before that I went into my message this morning I wanted just to speak to you just uh a little bit about um the the continued missionary and Outreach that we are doing here at evening like Tabernacle as you know during the building of this church we um were able to send those to go into Japan God provided that and and made a way for every step of the way and today there is a a church a gathering of Believers in Japan if you'll just show that picture of the Believers Gathering there and these are the Believers that are gathering there now um that um as the brothers went forth and began to bring the word and begin to labor then um this little you know we we saw fruits to the laborer and now there's a nice little group of Believers I'm meeting there in Yokohama area of Japan and um they are growing they're adding to the the church daily as such and um so we just recently sponsored a meeting of brother Danny del mundo from the Philippines to for him and his wife to fly into um Japan from the Philippines and to spend their I think they spent about 10 days to a couple of weeks there and they met in about three different places where that they were out reaching from Yokohama they had meetings here with the Believers here and then then branched out into different other places and while they were there um they baptized another believer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and this is a Japanese believer married to a Filipino wife but he is a Japanese person and he took on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we thanked the Lord for adding another soul to the kingdom of God amen and of course they have been baptizing regularly and and so on but this is in one of the outreaches there in the outer line areas of Japan it was quite a few different places that they went and um right now we are um we are I want to show the little picture of the little church building there that they have just rented a house because they um there's not really a church that they can buy or median or building like that so they actually rented a house in those two-story house and using the living room that is set up specifically for their meetings this was important and a great step for them as Believers because it provides them a regular meeting place or regular worship place where that it's set up and dedicated for that purpose while brother Danny del mundo was there he dedicated it unto the Lord and and so we are monthly helping to pay rent on this house and um that they can median so it's a it's an infant Church an infant work and it's a growing work and we of course have not been able to go back there because of covid I think you have to have three if not four vaccinations and so we have not met the requirements of all that they require because of covid rules and they just barely has opened up in fact we had to delay the meetings that were due in September over into October in order in order to or November rather so that um so that that brother Danny could go there because they had still had traveled restrictions into the nation of Japan this is now opening back up and Believers of course are are able to gather and Worship the Lord and rather than having to find a venue every every few weeks or every week you know and this week this this little room's available in this week is a small room this is a larger room you know back and forth now they have a permanent place that they have at least some for a year and so I just wanted you to know that we were helping to do this I left my paper in my room but I think we have a right at about 71 or two translations of sermons of brother branham's that we have sponsored this month I mean this year and this year that we've got like 71 or two that have been translated from English into the Japanese language these are put on the message hub you know sometimes people will criticize the use of the internet but you know um this is where the people from around the world that are japanese-speaking people can go to the message Hub actually you can go the message Hub and get French or English translation English French um all different kinds of languages Japanese now so so we got several hundred that we have been able to do this now that was at a cost of of um between sponsoring the meeting and and between um the translations we have spent um around fifteen thousand dollars last year just on on the um the missions for Japan and that's not to say of what we have done for other places um but you know while I'm talking about Japan I just want to just talk about the the spirit of God is moving there it's adding souls to the kingdom their healings that are taking place it was a Japanese sister with tumors in her lungs her dad died of the same condition it was a horrible condition and she was in a dying condition they laid hands on her and prayed far went back to the doctors all the tumors are gone so you know the signs followed the word and so there are healing Miracles and things of encouragement and I also wanted to say yesterday that I I sent a 1113 dollars for the two sermons of paradox and invisible Union to be translated into the Arabic language in Egypt so these will actually go and be able to help spread the gospel you know Paradox is a miracle and what you're actually seeing is a miracle take place and um as the gospel is going forth into all the world and so we did that yesterday um uh I also wanted to to mention that we pay monthly for the house rental of one of your favorite leading evangelists and I'll give you a hint he doesn't attend church here so it's not one of our brothers but you know we have an interest in others and other needs in other situations so we have been doing that on a monthly basis to provide help for uh and to help sponsor one of our evangelists on the field provide a provide that his rent is taken care of so that he doesn't have to worry about that he's got a he's got a roof over his head and of course um as you know we we support for ministers here in the church myself included and sending out two full-time evangelists as well and and uh so you know we are we're doing everything thing that we know to to reach the world with the Gospel of Jesus Christ and I want to just say I believe we've got the one of the best I'm just going to say one of the best Ministry teams in all the Earth amen that God has blessed us with here at evening light Tabernacle and I wanted to say also that you know um last month I was able to send ten thousand dollars to help the Believers in Newfoundland to purchase a church building that's a way up in the uh the the far northeast corner of North America in Newfoundland and they're they've been a a very dedicated group for many years under the pastor brother Gerald Lush they have a um a young Minister there a brother Jonathan curlette that is also now helping out and and the church is advancing they're moving they're adding Believers and the the church is growing and you know the the Catholic Church um actually in that area got into the whole diocese got into a big lawsuit because of the sex scenes of the priest and they lost a lot of their bill buildings and so they went they went and were were liquidated and to pay some of the some of the cost of their litigations and so on like that well it just so happens their losses are gained so one of those Catholic churches is now a message Church so God provides and so we were happy to help them out in this time we've also printed booklets and Outreach materials for Uganda as uh there is a mighty Revival that is sweeping that land and there are there are tremendous needs there we've helped you know um we've helped rebuild churches in the Philippines after the typhoons had destroyed them so you know I'm only saying this you know because God has blessed us in so many ways and provided for us and that I just wanted you to know when you give to missions we're trying to get this gospel out to the world because the gospel of this Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness and to All Nations and then shall the End come amen so you know if you if you pray about it and you think about it and God puts an extra uh dime in your pocket that you could give just write it on an envelope for Missions or on your check memo for Missions and drop it an offering and then we pray about it and try to send it out where that it can be we uh we know that God's people will be blessed by it and helped and we have a responsibility to others you say why would we want to be interested in others well I'll tell you why because we can't go into Rapture without them as I've said you know I I got the Holy Ghost and you didn't get it that day perhaps you got the holy ghost on a day and God met you and somebody else didn't receive it on that same day but when the Rapture takes place is not something we're doing individually it's something we're doing collectively that means then I can't go until you're ready to go so that's why I have an interest in the world that's why we have an interest in others that's why that we want to see the body of Christ Prosper around the world Amen so you know um for those online I know some people will wonder well how can we help well I'll just tell you if you feel to help on that PayPal charges us about three or four percent if you want to donate some to them that's fine but an old-fashioned check wrote out it'll all get to missions so anyway some it's good sometimes to be just old-fashioned right amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord today I wanted to say as a pastor thank you for all your help and labors of love to help with the wedding yesterday and not just to help but your generosity and the contributions um in every way your attendance your part it meant a lot to us as a family and as a church body and and I know you know when the time comes we'll be there for your young person as we as we um you know I talked with brother Buzz Bosey from Uganda and and of course there you know they expect a dowry and and so uh you know and so it's a really hard for young people to get started so most of them don't get started until in their 30s you know in a marriage because they got a save for Dowry to to pay for the the dad for the daughter well I said you know so I said it's not like Uganda we don't require uh 10 cows and 20 goats and um you know a bunch of gifts to give to the parents I said we help our kids get started and so I he wrote me back and he said that's a good custom I wish we had it here so you know it's a different in different parts of the world but you know the thing about it is God has a people around the world that he's calling for his namesake and I want to say I'm thankful that God has raised up young people in this church as they stood there you could tell that kiss was not practiced right everybody get down left that one had never been practiced before so you know they stood in front of the the pastor and right in front of the pastor took their first kiss and uh that's the kind of young people we want to raise is people who have dedicated themselves to the Lord and kept themselves and um for the for the purpose of uh serving Jesus and the gospel of Christ so let's stand together as we turn to Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 9 I want just to look into the word of God today and just see again something some nugget from the scripture that we can get out Genesis 18 and verse 9. yeah and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life I love those words they just resonate Within Me I will certainly this is an assurance will return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him and Abraham and Sarah were old and well-stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I'm old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also may God bless his words you can't be seated as we look into the today I'm going to speak on when the promise is delayed and if you don't mind I would like to turn to First Peter chapter 3 and verse 18. for some further reading as we look to this time and and it says for Christ also had suffered once for sins that just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the Spirit by which he uh also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison which were sometimes uh which sometimes were disobedient when Once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the art was a preparing wherein few and that is eight Souls were saved by water so I want you to notice from this scripture that he speaks of the long suffering of God wadeth so it goes to show us that when a promise is delayed that there is a purpose God has a purpose and a plan and there is something that he is doing that he's working all the time behind the scenes to bring the promise into fruition and though it may look like the promises forgotten really it's the long suffering of God that that will wait until you know given every opportunity moving every stone getting everything just right if you go to The Second Epistle of Peter chapter 3 and verse 1 he will say this Second Epistle Brethren I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure Minds by the way of remembrance that you may be mindful of The Words which was spoken before by the holy prophets and the Commandments of us the Apostles of the Lord and savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust so we're going to see in this that there's there's got to be adversity in the time of the Fulfillment of problems so here again he would tell us that that first now first I want to establish you're going to have opposition there's going to be difficulties it's not it's not going to come easy and there's going to be disagreements there's going to be those that scoff at the promise yeah actually brother Brandon when he preaches the Rapture sermon he first deals and almost the first half of his sermon with scoffers arising that will scoff at the promise of God and and as he was saying that will say where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers have fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation so again we find that it's going to have a an air to it or seemingly that everything is just the same as has always been that there's really nothing happening there's really been no changes there's really nothing taking place that you know it's a just a time of silence and God isn't doing anything and God isn't moving and um you know that it seemed like that maybe God went on vacation or perhaps um he made a promise and went back in the heavens and he just forgot it all but I want you to know that he would tell you then that they are willingly ignorant so there are some facts that they're overlooking that there are things that they're not putting in the equation when they're scoffing because there are other things that would that if you looked at it this way that it would balance out the view that you're having so he said they're willingly ignorant of that the word of by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and Perdition of ungodly men so he said just as the world was brought forth by the word God the word holds actually the is kept in store reserved unto the fire against the day of judgment so God has actually reserved things or holds things back to be revealed or made known in a certain hour so he says then he said but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day with the Lord is has a thousand years and a thousand years is one day so God isn't on your time and he doesn't count times like you count it and it really doesn't matter to God because he's Timeless he's eternal so the time that you have spent waiting on the promise it's it doesn't mean anything to God it's going to come to pass anyway and nothing's going to stop it because so next word said the Lord is not slack concerning his promise you see he's always working in in when you don't see him working he's he's moving when you're not seeing him move he's he's putting things into place that that has to be there in order for things to happen so he's not slack according to his promise but as some men count slackness but his long-suffering to us word he doesn't want to bring it premature he knows exactly the right time exactly the right moment for your deliverance for your freedom for your Liberty for your healing or whatever it is that you're calling upon God for waiting on the coming of the Lord but you see it is his long-suffering toward us not willing that any should perish that all should come to repentance this is the kind of God that we serve he's a God that will even let things go into overtime in order to in order to save those because he's not willing that any should perish he wants all to be saved he's a lot different from us so you know we get a little bit carnal minded with us for and no more and we could care less that the world went to hell in a handbasket you know but God isn't that a way he's not willing that it is to perish amen he his whole desire is that men might be saved sure he wants a bride and he wants her without spot or recall but God's even bigger than that he's got people wrote in his book that are not his bride they're a multitude without number you can't even number them for the multitude he's got such a big heart he was not willing that any should perish but that all might have eternal life this is a God we served he's a god of Grace he's a god of Mercy he's the God of Peace he's a god of love and he reaches down Way Beyond your thinking and and your abilities I'm even able to love and God can love the unlovable and when you were unlovable he died for you [Applause] and one thing about this God he don't ever leave you where he found you but his whole purpose is to lift you up into a higher place he's not slacked toward his promise but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with the great noise and the elements shall melt with a fervent Heat and the Earth and all the works that are darians shall be burned up seeing that all these shall be dissolved these things shall be dissolved what manner of person's ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness now the amplifier says it this way and it's the way I want to kind of emphasize it in this service since all these things are thus in the process are being dissolved there is a process that God has he has a method he has a plan he has a purpose he has a purpose for us facing 2023 right ahead he has a purpose for why he has kept us as long as he has he has a purpose for the gospel going to Japan and to all these other places and reaching out into the far places because his long suffered he's not willing that any should perish in fact there are others that has been seen in the vision Walking In step with the word and some of them are out of stealth and they're out of harmony with God but he's not forgiving them he's not casting them aside even those that are not walking right is void the boy screams out get back in line get back in line you see what it is it's the mercies of God that is reaching out Way Beyond human comprehension now so as we see that the process of being resolved what kind of people ought each of you to be in the meanwhile and consecrated and holy behavior and devout and godly qualities so what kind of people are we to be seeing everything's coming to an end sin is going to come as a thief in the night seeing that it grinds slow but sure but it's coming what kind of people are we to be again it says since all these things will be destroyed in this way what kind of people should you be your lives should be holy and dedicated to God another translation or the next verse says looking for in Hasting unto the coming of the day of God we're in the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with the fervent Heat I like it this when it says it this way in the in the Amplified as you wait for the day of God do your best or do your part to make it come soon so when you're looking at the coming of the Lord do you be ready don't let you be the hindrance amen do your best to make it come soon amen because you know again the day will come when the heavens will burn up and be destroyed and the heavenly bodies will be melt will melt by the fervent heat but nevertheless we according to his promise we look for new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness where that righteousness will be at home you can look around in this world and you can see this is not our home the more you stay here the less welcome you feel your values the things you believe the things you hold true the lest you feel welcome you don't fit in you're not a part wherefore beloved sin that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blame us an account that the long suffering of Our Lord is salvation even as a beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him that's written unto you and also in his epistle speaking in them are things in which are some things hard to be understood and which they that are learned or unstable rest as they do also the other scriptures to their own destruction yet ye therefore beloved sin you know these things before bewareless also ye also being led astray with the era of the wickedness fall from your own steadfastness but grow in Grace in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory for now but now and forever so these are the words of Peter as he admonishes that to look toward the end times and we are living in the Fulfillment of the word of God and and it's been a long delay of 2 000 years yeah we've come down through seven churches and this made this made things you know in Our Generations as things begin to change and you you could The Winds of chains begin to blow and the moving of the Holy Spirit as The Farmer in the latter rain began to be poured out you can see it even begin but 1906 in our own um laodicea and AIDS where the Holy Spirit would be poured out there in Azusa Street and and then you know that would be it seemed like a time where they would just kind of sink down and despair and make another denomination and forget the original um uh call that they had and and didn't then we would see God move on the scene and he would send a an angel to a a man and would meet with him a prophet of God and an ordain him and send him out with a message of Divine Healing and this made men such as Jack Moore and Gordon Lindsay to write in their book Bible days are here again because they could see now scriptures that were literally being fulfilled and it caused a a Revival in a and uh and uh you know a and a time of of a real excitement as they looked into the promises of God and saw you know God is not just the god of the Bible but he's a god of today now so you know we we of course have seen many great things that have happened in this last age and Sarah and Abraham they also have seen great things happen and God had called Abraham 25 years before this at 75 years old and and Sarah was 65 and now the promise had been delayed for 25 years when God gave him the promise of a son and being a great nation he was already an old man he was 75 as I said and even then when the promise was given it seemed impossible and that's the way it is when it comes to God's promises is always something that doesn't seem likely it just doesn't fit in the regular routine or doesn't fit with man's thinking and so it seemed impossible but you know even in there Satan would delay this promise even more in brother random would talk about this and I know my redeemer to liveth he said when Abraham was 75 he got the promise of God and he told him to Sarah and the devil said you know what I'm just going to delay that for a while I believe if I could just get them so old they'll lose faith and they'll know it can happen if they're already shaking at 75 if I can just keep it that way for a while and he kept it away until Abraham and Sarah were stooped in aged gray hair and stoop-shouldered but you know one thing the Devil May throw a stumbling block and a hindrance but he cannot stop the promise of God the promise of God is going to come to pass no matter what kind of obstacles the devil puts in the way her body was old her it was wrinkled the milk veins were dried up her heart was so weak it could not have went through labor but God lets us know his purpose will not be defeated a man he he changed Sarah made her back to a young woman again to the man a hundred years old turned it back to his youth now that may seem unreasonable but you see God gave a promise and the Bible looked at it for gave Abraham's mistakes and his stumbles along the way and he would write of him and Abraham started not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong given for God praise for he judged him faithful and that he was able to perform what he promised now you know it seems there's always a delay when it comes to God's promises that's when you've got to be certain of God you may be looking maybe for something to happen maybe a husband to be saved maybe your children that are lost to come back you may be looking for a change in your finances or troubles in your home or or something that take place maybe you're Barren and you're looking for a child or you know something that that is that that is there that that you have an Earnest hope and expectation for but you just remember that that it seems that there's always a delay when it comes to God's promises but that's when you need to be certain of God you've got to be certain that he keeps his word that he's going to do what he said he would do there are delays sometimes when you pray that it don't seem that God will answer and that's again when you have to be certain of God you've got to be sure of him amen as brother Branham told us and be certain of God he said you know when we can confess our sins and we met a requirement that God requires we believed on God there's a circumstances that has to be met and it's according to his will and we confessed our sins and we made all the wrongs that we did right and we've done everything we know how to do every requirement that God had made or asked and we met that requirement and yet he remains silent he just don't answer us and he said I'm sure I'm speaking to people this morning who's come to that place and brother Brandon said I've been there myself many times when I went back and I traced my life and I've turned over every stone and I find that I did something's wrong and I go confess that and Lord God I'll make that right and I'll go do it and come back say now Lord You're God and you'll answer me surely I've met every request that you required me to do and every requirement that and I've met it and still he won't move he just seems to set silent that's what you got to be sure you've got to be sure that he's God don't be discouraged the only thing is that your heart is to be certain of God amen so when God gives a promise he doesn't say when he just says I'm going to do it and it's on my time not on your time and you're gonna wait and you're gonna have to have some patience but I'm going to bring it to pass but I'm going to teach you you know to to to wait and I'm going to teach you to have patience and I'm going to teach you so that you can run one day and not be weary and walk in that fate I'm going to teach you that you don't just easily give up you just don't throw in the towel and quit but you persevere perseverance holding on to the promise that when you take a hold it like Jacob did he was he was known as his other name was heel Grabber because he come out with his hand on his mother's heel he was a little bit late but he was grabbing to out there trying to be the first Amanda you know he was reaching out and though he was a little bit late as a he'll grab her he didn't give up he wanted that blessing he wanted the birthright he wanted the promise and he got the blessing of the firstborn because that he was perseverant [Music] amen God it looked like it was for somebody else it looked like it would be delayed but God gave it to him because of his perseverance habaka two and three says for the vision is for an appointed time God has an appointed time he's as a set time for your promise to be fulfilled it wasn't fulfilled this year well he's got to set time for it your healing didn't come to yep today he's got to set time for it your children wasn't saved yet and hadn't come in he's got to set time for it amen you you've got the you need a new job or you need to be blessed God's got to set time for it you know your whole deal is to be certain of God be certain that he has the perfect timing that he won't bring it prematurely amen but everything's going to be in place he's a god of order that places things in the right place amen because he said at the end it shall speak and not lie though it Terry wait for it because it will surely come it will not carry so you see he said the vision is for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak you see this is when the vision Speaks now that not during the delay but when when the end comes then you see the reason speaking and it will not lie it'll it though it Parry wait for it because it will surely come God's promises surely come to pass the Bible said in Hebrews 6 and 12 he that we are to be followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promise you say brother Tim I believe yes you believe but God requires some patience to go along with your faith a lot of people just say well I've got the faith for it I believe God I accept it is my promise but then they give up because they don't have patience but I want you to notice this through faith and patience that you inherit the promise for when God made the promise of Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself and when he swerved himself what he did he was pledging all that he was he was saying Out of Heaven is behind us all my Majesty all my power all my glory all my honor is all behind the promise that I'm giving and because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself and so he said Saiyan surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and I said so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise what he had to First patiently endure it didn't just come with the snap of the finger God give the promise and that was it but no he had to patiently endure but listen to his word that all happened is behind us with blessing I will bless you can't you take that promise to yourself amen you're the Seed of Abraham if God gave this promise to Abraham he gave it to you too that blessing I Will Bless thee and I'm going to multiply you I'm going to make you greater than where you are that you're not going to stand in mediocrity you're not going to remain where you are in this moment but I'm going to add to you you're going to be blessed you're going to be honored you're going to be lifted up you're not on your way down you're on your way up I want you to know you are not the people of the dissension that is falling we have a world that is falling it is falling into sin it is falling in unbelief but you are not that kind of people you are the people who will rise you are the people of the Ascension you are the people of the rapture but it takes faith and takes patience now let me say it this way first you've got to get in agreement with God that's your first step Lord you promised you would bust me you promised no good thing would you hold from them to walk uprightly you promised Lord you you would bless me in the field you'd bless me you know in the city you would bless me and everywhere you you promised your blessings your blessings is upon me God the spirit of the Lord is upon me I can't help but be blessed I'm the son of prosperity I'm like Joseph in the Bible no matter what comes against me I'm going to prosper doesn't matter if I'm sold into Egypt or throw down in a pit first I'm going to be blessed am I blessed with life and lived out in Egypt blessed there to become a servant and a slave I gotta learn the language I got to learn the custom I gotta start at the bottom people want to start at the top and God said I'm going to bring you through some series of things so that when you reach the position that I want you in you have the character to go with it [Applause] I'm not going to just Elevate you from a young boy you know with a dream and a vision and oh I saw you kneel down to me and I'm going to be in this great position and you know and wear this coat a little color of Many Colors and strutting around God said no no I can't put you there yet I got some things to do for you there's got to be some working on your character there's got to be changings in your attitudes I'm going to teach you something in this trial you to never learned by somebody telling you you're going to go through some things that are going to hone you and give you a character that you can help others that you're going to be a beacon that you're going to be a light and a testimony say well brother Tim my family isn't served in God and my servant my family is all broke apart and my mom and dad they won't even speak to each other but God allowing you to go through that so that you can break the cycle that you can show that out of weakness God can make strength that God can show that out of your life he can have an overcomer no matter what kind of evil that you were set in and the troubles that were against you amen God comes through to produce a character in your life to make you an overcomer to be ever said a light a testimony that others might see after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise it takes faith and patience not just Faith well brother Tim I've got faith I received the Revelation glory to God we got the faith of this message we got the faith we are got the original Faith well God's giving you some patience you're going to have to learn some patience to go along with it but first thing I want to say you're going to have to get in agreement with God and then the battle is from then on to stay in agreement with God got to give you a promise maybe it's the promise of healing and and you agree with it yes amen but then the doctor's report comes then the negative report comes then the opposition comes that's the battle to stay in agreement you've got to stay in agreement with God and I want to say this the promise has got to get in your spirit first you see once it's in your spirit then it becomes your confession a lot of people that never let the promise of God become in their Spirit you can tell you know oh they're still in their Wilds see whilst he Woos are still in their troubles and they're all my heartaches and I spin this way all my life like I was preaching last Sunday you're in the darkness of the tent and God's calling you to come and do the light amen let the light shine on the Promises of God for you but but you see you you've got to get in your spirit first this is the way that Sarah was she had heard the promise but it had never got in her spirit she sat back in her doldrums in her wowzy wowzy Woos in her lukewarmness and she laid back their inner despondency it'll never be me it'll never happen for me if my others get blessed but I don't ever get blessed look like when healing the angel comes by and there's healing in the church somebody else gets a blessing but I don't get it amen where where is there a blind part of mass that'll sit by the wayside and hear Jesus is present and screams out thou son of David Don't Pass Me By amen somebody that'll get an agreement amen he's the Redeemer he's the Savior but he's not just the Savior and the Redeemer but he's my savior and he's my redeemer he's my God [Applause] wants your spirit once it's in your spirit it becomes your confession then you start confessing that I'm Healed yes I have my troubles yes maybe today's not been the best day but it's still I'm still healed his word is still true I know this is just part of my story this is just part of my journey amen this is part of the steps that I have to take I've got to go down into the low valleys in order to get up on the mountains come on Amen I've got to go through the hardships in order to enjoy the blessings you seek to believe is a commitment and you have to have the boldness to believe when you believe a promise you're committing yourself to it come on God gives a vow and he said I'm not giving up I'm putting all in heaven listen when you enter into Covenant with God you need to come with the same thing with the same tenacity God you gave a promise and I'm not giving up on it if you're pledging all you have to fulfill this then I'm pledging all I have to see that it's fulfilled I'm going to do my part people look for evidence I need evidence the Bible said faith is the evidence of Things Not Seen that's the only evidence you need is faith be uncertain of God knowing god said it he said he was wounded for my transgressions he said he was bruised from my iniquities he said he took his my weapons that I should have got he took them upon himself and with his stripes I am healed amen you know I may not see it yet but that's I'm already healed hey man I'm already here's Abraham I'm a father of Nations would secede Abraham don't have one yet but I'm a father of Nations God gave me a promise and I'm going to wear that name come on amen you got to change your name and your identity from being I'm the sick one I'm the troubled one I'm the one I'm always all of hell is against me and I you know always poor mouth you've got to change your confession I'm a son of the most high God Amen I'm a child of Glory I am the redeemed of the Lord I am the blessed to God I am all that he said that I am I am who he said I am I need evidence your faith is the evidence of Things Not Seen faith is the evidence of things you only could hope for you have the evidence when you have faith When you pray you might be like Elijah you pray and there's there's no cloud you send the you send the guy out looking and you pray with all your heart the Bible said that that Elijah was a man of like passion as we are and he prayed earnestly and here he would pray earnestly one time and it didn't happen sin is serving out what do you see I don't see nothing you mean Elijah prayed and nothing happened yeah Elijah prayed and nothing happened but God had given a promise I'm going to send rain and Abraham I mean Elijah was not going to give up on that promise he didn't see it the first time he didn't see it the second time he didn't see it the third time he didn't see it the fourth time he didn't see it the fifth time he didn't see it the sixth time but the seventh time the servant come back and said yeah I see something it ain't much it ain't a big sign you know but but I wanted you to know your delay is over I did see a cloud and it's the size of a man's hand that's all I need I don't need anything else go prepare go tell me how prepare his Chariot amen girl I'm gonna run before him that gave him such energy he said I hear the sound of the abundance of rain [Music] Hallelujah when you see just a little bit of move you begin to say I can hear back here get ready coming I hear the blessing coming I hear the power coming I don't need a great move I just see a little something happen I just see God is on the scene it may not move much but gotta take something that is little and he'll make it big I'll tell you it's about time for Godly in your drought it's about time for the famine to be over it's about time for you to come into your blessings isn't that time that the god of Elijah saw himself to be the same yesterday today and forever you see victory lays on the other side of your struggle victory is on the other side of your trial I want to tell you there will always be a red sea in your way there will always be Giants in the land that God gave you to inherit sometimes it is so dark you can't see your hand in front of your face and brother Brandon would tell us that very words and he said but there is a man here that God is present to turn on the lights that any moment that suddenly things could change and I want you to begin to look in your life for a sudden change for things that you have prayed for dreamed about had visions of Lord you long far for suddenly you see the Lord certainly will come to his Temple there's things that God does that he you know that he you know it seemed like there's been a delay and I'll hold him back and then suddenly everything begins to change suddenly there's a cloud the size of a man's hand Mary and Martha they were friends of Jesus but they experienced a delay Jesus would delay his coming you know why Jesus would delay his coming so he could be a part of their story where he could show I am the resurrection and the life so that he could come right down there and man move right into the story of their life and then life their story would have never been the same had my life was died nobody would have known that he was a resurrection in the life amen that a man for days dead and four days on his journey into the regions of the dead here would be called back nobody would have ever known that we'd never experienced that unless there was a delay but God had a purpose he had a plan and he says I gotta wait here because I've got a moment I'm going to show up I want you to look at the moment when God shows up and he shows out I want to tell you today God's about to show up in your life and when God shows up he shows out Hallelujah he the drought becomes over the rain comes and you ought to be hearing it tomorrow this morning as the word comes forward that's the sound that's the sound it's the sound the rain's coming it's a sad blessings are about to fall that the promise is about to be fulfilled in my life [Applause] God wants to write himself in your story there will be your Red Sea that he comes and fights for you that he say this battle's not yours it's mine I'm personally involved in your life you're not on your own you're not just a drift in life C but I'm the guide I'm your director I'm Your Leader I'm there for you I'll never leave you or forsake you as it was in the days of Noah there was delay Peter refers to this as while the ark wasn't preparing while things were being made ready for that great climatic change that was going to happen and Jesus warned us of this day as he said as it was in the days of Noah and it is now time as you know for the cleansing of the Earth for the millennium but this time it is by fire there'd be nuclear destruction there's never been an age where that the Beast has power as recorded in Revelation 13 to be do miracles in the sight of the World by bringing fire down out of heaven there's never been a time like in the book of Zechariah where the plague would be that that as the nuclear destruction comes across that men would be standing and their flesh would just melt off of their bones and their eyes and their sockets never been a day like we're in where we're so close on the edge of the burning 90 years ago it was spoken it'll be 90 in this next year in June of 1933 it was seen in the vision smoke bombs and craters all over the land of America as far as the eye could see but I want just to know that's just part of the burning of the Earth America will burn the Bible said Rome will burn but then the whole earth will burn and the righteous will walk out on the ashes of the wicked and never forget that part of Malachi 4 says that God will send the light to the prophet before the coming of the day of the Lord right now is men's day but the day of the Lord brings a Day of Reckoning and the Bible tells you there that that the that the Earth will burn as an oven and that the righteous will walk out on the ashes of the wicked for the great Millennial ring and he said I'm going to send you a lie to the prophet before this happens because there's got to be a people's heart that'll turn back to the gospel of Christ amen there's got to be the true gospel restored in order for the people to be made ready because I'm not just going to destroy the Earth but without taking a Remnant I'm gonna do what I said I'm going to have a bride and she'll be without spa or without wrinkle or without blemish but to do this the world's in confusion the world's in darkness the world's in trouble the world's split up and 40 something thousand denominational views you have a difficult time weighing yourself well I want to find the truth brother Tim I want to find the real truth well go out there forty thousand denominations go search them all out how many lifetimes that going to take to listen to all this this and says this and this and says that your yo-yo up and down don't know what to believe that's why God had to vindicate a word in this day to take all the guessing out of it amen God wanted you to know of assured you what his word was by confirming it with signs following amen so I want you to forget that part of Malachi 4 that says that God will send the lives of the Prophet before the coming of the day of the Lord that there Comes a Day of Reckoning and we're in a Day of Reckoning the Bible tells you and we'll turn to Revelation 16 15. I want to read a few verses here but you know again the Bible tells you that there are vials or bowls of Judgment of stored up judgments that are just waiting to be poured out isn't that amazing that God would have actually both shown symbolically in the Book of Revelation as vials or bowls of judgment that are stored up that are waiting to be poured out you often wonder why does God delay and pouring it out why does God wait until certain time I can think down to the Dark Ages when men and women were at the at the the stocks being beat and whipped women's hair dipped and tired and burnt the breasts cut off babies cut out gamble over the sex treated him like worse than animals 68 million down to the Dark Ages killed and slaughtered let me tell you the only reason they could do it was because they were anointed to do so I want you to get the picture they didn't do that on their own there was a the ox anointing or the calf anointing of the four anointings of the spirit of God the lion the ox the man and the eagle and that day the ox anointing that Holy Spirit the cherubim had turned and looked toward them that way and said my Deliverance is going to be for you through death a beast of sacrifice and I'll deliver my people but they'll be faithful unto death I'll brother Tim I'll tell you what I I can't live this message I'll tell you what I'll just go I'm not going to make the Rapture I'll just make it in the defibrillation you can't live for it now how are you going to die for it then I wouldn't make plans for that amen right now there's an anointing and it's not an ox anointing it's an eagle anointing and it's not a Sitting Duck it's a flying eagle amen and don't worry about crossing the river and then it flies right over between death right into the other dimensions it crosses right over amen is said of you that they that wait of the Lord they will renew their strength and they will Mount up with wings as an eagle they'll run and not be weary they'll walk and not faint this is called the anointing upon this age it's the eagle anointing it's the miracle anointing it's where he snatches the people away it's his Escape I want you to know the Rapture is an escape some people say well I don't look as a Rapture as an escape it is an escape the Bible said we should pray always Jesus I pray always to be counted worthy to escape the things that are coming upon this Earth and God has provided a way out for you just as he provided away through the Red Sea and Escape for Israel God has provided an escape for you in this day you'll not go through the tribulation little children you're going to go into Rapture amen you're going to escape the judgments because I've got to judge the world but I can't judge it yet you see I can't judge it I can't pour out those judgments on the earth until I get my people out of there why God would you delay here they are screaming out against that Beast system against the great against the evils that are done calling on the name of the Lord watching their children killed and slaughtered murdered and all this God why don't you answer and how come you won't judge them and how come you don't move and God says I'm reserving it because there's a part the great has to play in the end time I can't wipe her out yet she's got a part to fulfill so therefore what I'm going to do is all these curses all of these speaking against us God don't let them fall to the ground he stores it up and he holds it in bowls of judgment to be poured out in the tribulation you see the Bible tells you that you know that we should rest with him concerning the coming of the Lord because that that God he is he he's not unrighteous to forget he's a he's a Kinsman he's a kinsman redeemer but yes he's a Kinsman Avenger and he says I'm going to avenge that which is done wrong I want you to know today the devil and none of his angels will ever get by with anything they've ever done to a child of God I want you to know that God is on the trail because his kids but Redeemer it's his honor to right the wrongs that's been done to you not only will Satan have a jail time of a thousand years but he's going to have an end but glory to God you don't have an end and you don't have any jail time amen you're going to be a journey enjoying a millennium a thousand years of Peace reigning with him as king of kings and Lord of Lord the Queen by his side amen you're you are people of the Ascension amen you're ascending into Glory you're not going down you're going up [Applause] verse 15 of chapter 16. behold I come as a thief these are the words that Peter had said he comes as a thief comes in suddenly quietly he gets what he wants and goes I'm coming as a thief oh you said brother to him when he comes ever I will see him and every tongue will confess wrong coming they'll look on him when they appears from coming yes do you know we're we're not just in one coming in this day you know you know right in this in this last day there are more than one coming of the Lord really yeah there's more than one coming there's a coming he came two thousand years ago to redeem a church amen then he comes for a church and then he comes back with his church so in this day there's actually not very many years difference or between the Coming Far and they're coming back with amen we are in the day of a double coming he's coming for you and you're coming back with him you're going away for a marriage supper of the Lamb and then you spend three and a half years with him in glory I don't know how it's going to be but I kind of Envision it like this as we're all sitting down there you know there are seven there are seven plagues there there are the seven seven vials of place of startup judgments if you read real carefully there are seven angels these seven angel or seven churches Messengers these seven angels there they also hold seven bias because he said one said to me which held one of the seven vials uh he said to me come and let me show you the Lamb's wife come let me show you the Judgment of the great and he was so much like Christ and he bowed down to worship Him John who knew better than to worship Angels or anything else this one is so much like Christ he bowed down the words of enemy because he got sins of Ministry of Christ in this man and he bowed down the word somebody said don't you do it I'm a prophet like you are I'm one of your fellow servants so a man was holding the vials of judgment he's called a messenger an angel you see angels can be Earthly men or Heavenly Creatures behold I send my messenger my angel before my face that was John the Baptist he was an angel he was a messenger it wasn't winged angel he was in a Heavenly Angel he was an Earthly angel seven angels seven Church ages seven Messengers these are two Seven Ages what is God doing he's bringing a message and I can Envision as we're all sitting down there at the great marriage supper of the Lamb I can hear him almost down at this side of the table as he wipes away all tears and takes for my remembrance and they look over across and some of them looks and say well you know how we were persecuted and what happened and how you died and you know and here we are look at us we're enjoying the marriage supper of the Lamb it wasn't in vain brother when you stood on the ice and you went down naked there and freezing and and you stood there and you would not deny his name and you live for what you knew you stood for the gospel it was been worth it all has it brother about that time one of the messengers stands up and said time for a little entertainment he picks up his bowl of judgment and he walks over between the corners of Heaven and Earth he pours out a judgment and there's all kinds of hell that is Unleashed on the Earth as judgment comes on the Earth and he walks back and he takes a seat at the table and the whole process is repeating until all the judgments of God is poured out this all happens in the great wedding supper I'm coming as a thief as I said how does the thief come you know I'll know when he's coming brother tell me I know you better be watching there is one word that is given concerned in his company he said watch don't go to sleep Don't Close Your Eyes don't pretend it's always going to be the way it is today it ain't change is about to happen foreign you can already see seasons is changing you can know storms are coming you look out there you know and you can feel the humidity in the air and you can feel the pressure you know the barometric pressure you can feel all of this you know you know it's not summertime you know that there's a storm coming you know Monster is building up for a big class in the heavens and you know with the trouble that's on the earth When sin is reaching its height you know that it's all building up with a great war in the heavens and the devil will be cast down and a pride will go up it cannot always remain the way it is these are changing and we can feel the whims of change how does the teeth come you know how I described it before you're laying in your bed there's a big picture window in your room Here Comes a thief in the middle of the night he takes this big rock talking about that big finds a brick or a bat and he comes and he smashes that windows and he jumps in and screams on apathy what's he shaking your head for you Google that you know Google will probably tell you that Miss Google don't get everything right that's not a way a thief comes our thief comes in secret he comes in he gets what he wants and he leaves and nobody even knew he was there and it may be a month later oh that jewelry that money I had that stored away under the bed or in the closet or here there in my Hiding Place and it's not there did you get it Johnny did you see it James did you John you know who who was it who got this no we never said Mama I had never touched it finally you realize it was a thief and that's where the Rapture is going to be God's going to come and take his little bride his prized possession like a thief in the night and he is going to take his bride out of here and the world will go on just like it always has it won't be reported in Fox News not on CNN so don't be watching for the news to see if the Rapture took place raptures don't happen in CNN you get drugged down not taken up and that's where it's coming his coming the way he says in fact you may not think we know the day of the hour of his coming but I'm I'm one who does when this hour of his coming well let me tell you the Bible the hour you think not when you're least expecting it the change is coming when you when others have given up and scoffed the change is coming amen you said well brother Tim yard clueless no we're not we've already seen the sign amen the size of a man's hand we already know the atmosphere is changing we know already we keep feeling home in this world anymore we already know Sodom is increasing the fire is about to fall nuclear destruction relates they threaten it every day blessed is the one who remains awake or who watch us and keepeth His Garment lest he walk naked and they see his shame verse 16 and he gathered them all together to a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon you see there is a gathering and right now Satan is gathered his forces right now people are it's in a choosing time this is the only time you can choose do you know even after the Rapture you will not be able to choose only right now is your only opportunity to choose today is the day of salvation to wait until then it's going to be too late the Bible said that he that is filthy will be filthy still he that is Holy will be holy still there'll be no change and so only right now is the only opportunity you have it all to make preparations for the going to be ready to be watching and he's going to come to those who love his appearing and there's got to be a people who love is coming and I don't just mean out there but even as coming to church that welcome his appearance they welcome him in the song they welcome into the preaching that welcoming in their worship you say what are these people shouting about brother Tim they are welcoming him they love him he appears so he gathered them to a place called Armageddon you are either being gathered for one war one side of the war or the other side brother Branham would tell us even the rock and roll music of Pat Boone and some of these Elvis Presleys and others he said they're actually Gathering people to Armageddon you're being gathered in your worship you see the Gathering you see people are taking their sides now you today are taking your sides now you're making your choice now you're preparing now absolutely you're making preparations to go into Rapture or to miss the rapture to be honest with you you know to be lost you have to really work hard at it because God's done everything in the wood that he could do to save you and you have to walk over every promise of God to be lost you have to fight your way to hell you say well I believe brother Tim I believe the message where's the commitment where is the life that is dedicated a consecration of surrenderings and obedience where is that that calls you to prayer that calls you to walk with God where is it that he works with you in spiritual ways in spiritual dreams and visions and anointings of the holy spirit so well that's passed by the Tim you're making a decision and your decision is to believe in a god of the past rather than the god of the present and you're being gathered to Armageddon but God has gathered the people to his word and his word has power in it it sets the captive free it opens the eyes of the blind it anoints men and women it sets them forward it puts a fire in their life it gives them a passion for truth he gathered him into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon and you can see people being gathered people taking their side and the seventh angel poured out his Bowlers vial into the air into the atmosphere and there as he did there came a voice how the temple great voice of the Temple of Heaven saying it is done the plants have been poured out the judgment is finished the Fate is sealed and there were voices and Thunders and Lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as not since men were upon the Earth some might be an earthquake and so great and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the Nations fell and great Babylon came and remembers before God God don't forget that he's going to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his Wrath and every island fled away in the mountains were not found and their fallible men of great hell out of Heaven every stone about the weight of a talent and Men blasphemed God because of the palate the plague of a great hell this hail Stones weighing a hundred pounds right about a hundred pounds apiece coming down out of the heavens because God will judge the great and he will do exactly like he did in the Old Testament when he spelled them with stones he was Stone them with hailstones because the rejection of his word it's a serious hand thing to fall in the hands of an Angry God the Bible tells you that Rome will burn in an hour there's a lot of this that we could go on but I want you to go with me to Revelation 18 because it's part of the scriptures for our age it's part of the Prophecies of the end time Revelation 18 and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of there my people that's why we're here today amen that's why we're here yes we came out we met in Little Homes amen we found little places like they do in Japan now we we we we we went through our home meetings we went into our old abandoned churches and man fixed them up and and made them word that we could try to meet there and we built buildings we won the place where the word of God could be preached and men like to choose when they left out of Europe and was going into Israel they wanted a Homeland well what they believed would be appreciated and loved and they could have freedom to believe that we wanted that freedom and the Bible said come out of her my people we obeyed that call that's why we're here today why that you don't be partakers of her sins and receive not of her plagues that's why we come out because the plagues that is coming upon them are not for us I want you to understand God is going to get you out of here before the pledge fall the fire is going to fall but I'm going to take a Rapture I'm going to have a people amen that are prepared that are ready that are watching they're not the people of neglect they're not a people who who are scoffing young finding fault oh this ain't right that ain't right and I can't find anywhere to go to church but you know that that even more that you see that day approaching is somebody with me now you're sipping together you're encouraging and edifying others you're teaching your children but God first have a priorities right amen we're we're not in this world we're not like the Heathen out there we go and worship God we've come to the house of God we worship him when we come we don't sit in our Pew and draw on paper we get in there and we clap our hands we raise our hands and worship we participate foreign my people we're not the receiver of our Plex for your sins have reached into heaven and God hath to remembered oh God I'm so glad that our sins and our iniquities he remembers no more but if there's no repentance if there's no and your repentance is not a turning from then he will remember your iniquities rewarder even if she rewarded you and doubled to her double according to works I'm not just going to pair back I'm gonna double up on it Amen in the cup which she is filled filled her double how much is glorified herself and lived luxuriously and deliciously in so much torment and sorrow Giver for she said in the heart I sit as a queen and I am no Widow and shall see no sorrow therefore her plague shall come in one day deaths and mourning and famine and she saw her utterly burned with fire for strong is the Lord who judges her and the kings of the earth who committed fornication who lived luxuriously deliciously with her shall be well or lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her burning standing afar off for the fear of her torment and saith alasis last that great City Babylon that Mighty City for one hour is our judgment come think about it one hour she comes to waste one hour is over with one hour just think about that brother Brandon would preach sermons like from that time on he says from from that from from today in five years you could be you could be cleaning the spit Tunes in the inner in a a in a in a saloon five years from today you could be a drunk on the street five years today your marriage could be in shambles your home destroyed or five years today you could be a real Christian it all starts today but it's going to catch up with you whatever Choice you're making is going to catch up with you you've got to decide today because in one hour things can change it'll happen so quickly and the Bible says then the merchants of the Earth shall weep and mourn over for no man buy it for merchandise anymore the merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine lemon and purple and silk and Scarlet and find wood and all minors or kinds of of vessels of Ivory and all kinds of manner of vessels and most precious wood and bronze and brass and and iron and marble and cinnamon and the incense and goes on and on and on and on you know listening and then verse 15 the merchants of these who have made Rich by her stand to far off for fear of her torment weeping and wailing saying the last alas that great city that was clothed in fine linen and purple and Scarlet and be decked and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls in one hour so great riches has come to nothing and every shipmaster in the company and the ships and the sailors and many in this trade by Seas to the far off and cried when the saw the smoke of a burning sand what city is like that great City and they cast dust on their Earth on their heads and who cried and weeping and wailing said alas alas that great City and which was made Rich all that had ships in the sea by reason or the costliness in one hour she's made desolate come Somebody's Crying over but I want you to notice the next verse says and rejoice over her thou heaven and ye Holy Apostles and Prophets for God has Avenged you on her God is going to pay back every room that's ever been done to you God remembers he's writing an account you don't have to do the paying back he said vengeance is mine I will repay yourself the Lord but I'll tell you what God's going to pay back he's not going to forget one thing that's been done against his bride his elect his people he's a Kinsman Avenger they're going to face the Wrath of the Lamb he says and the mighty Angel verse 21 a mighty Angel took a stone like a millstone great Millstone cast in the sea it's a dust with violence shall that great City Babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all and the voice of Harpers and minstrels musicians and the flute players of Pipers and the trumpeters shall be heard no more at all indeed and no Craftsmen or whatever craft he'd be so be found any more indeed and the sounds of a millstone shall be heard indeed no more and the light of the Lamb a candle shall light shine no more at all indeed and the voice of the Bride Drew and the voice of the Bride so be heard no more at all of the for thy Merchants were the Great Men of the Earth for by thy sorceries where all the nations deceived and then her was found all the blood of prophets and Saints and all that are slain upon the Earth and nobody fits that description like Rome does all the days of judgment are heaping up waiting for the bride of Christ to be raptured so that they can be poured out the scripture says concerning is coming he that letteth will land until he be taken away this Feats of the Holy Spirit and brother Branham attributed that to the holy spirit being on the bride when he ministered the seals so he says he that let us will let until she be taken out of the way because this is where that God is working and he's moving he's moving in a people and he's going to allow the mystery of iniquity to work until the bride is taken out of the way but one day he's going to take her out and when he does the man of sin will be revealed the man a position and that the Son of Perdition and there he will he will he will be as soon in Revelation 12. Satan will be cast down under the Earth and he will come down have a great Wrath because he has but a short time the devil don't have much longer I want to announce to you the devil is out of time Hallelujah the devil is out of time we've reached the hour where the delay is coming over the time even for your temptation is coming to an end the times of your trouble the time of the accuser of the brothers to accuse you his time of accusation is coming to an end in fact of the matter I want to just announce it's already over because God is set to a prophet you are the sinless ventures bright in Jesus Christ you never did it in the first place Hallelujah and the time of his accusation the time of the scoffing not over one day they'll scoff for the last time I think about this bride is very happy Rahab was a harlot Rahab was a gentile Rahab would be such a woman of faith she be wrote as a hero of faith God took a harlot and made a woman of Faith out of her that's the kind of Miracles my God does take a prostitute and he'll vain woman make her hero God can take a life of shambles and turn it around he can do that for you he can do that for your children he did this for Rahab he provided salvation for her and her house because she believed the report you know the city was trembling because the devil the devil's the demons there in that City they had heard what he'd done at the Red Sea and they knew it was true they'd heard how he defeated their enemies and they knew it was true they heard how he provided bread out of Heaven they knew it was true and they knew he could bring water from a rock and he just crossed him over Jordan in the flood stage and they said we've heard we've heard what your God did we've heard what kind of God I believe that I want that God save me don't let me and my family be lost and he says she saved and sent out to spies on the other side of her battle that day at the Battle of Jericho her family was saved her house was saved it was on the wall that was the only thing that didn't crumble because when you're when your house is built in faith it'll never fall down and here even when judgments was falling around and then and Joshua the Judgment Angel was coming into the city and going to Destroyer there was a remnant God always has a remnant and here in this moment in his time Here Comes Rahab there's a young man there by the name of Simone some might call it salmon salmon in the Bible just so I'm not calling him a fish so salmon you know he he falls in love with this Rahab and I can imagine the wedding ceremony coming on the standing before Joshua and the wedding suppers on and and and and and and the ceremonies going on is there any reason is there any impediment is there any reason why this woman shouldn't be married to this man somebody comes up yep if he was a harlot yep she had a dirty life yep she's not worthy yep she getting married be married into the tribe but Judah don't you know through that seed line will come Christ and she'll be the mother of the Messiah see not worthy to be that and Joshua would turn around and look he said woman where are your accusers [Applause] bring the Accuser bring them out bring those men that slept with you bring all of that that was of your past bring all that evil now bring them up and let us see you let's examine that they're all dead Hallelujah what's it going to be that day whenever one of your enemy is dead they don't let people that bothered you that oh that old drug problem that you have got a wife or whatever it was your past is all gone you you know accuser they can accuse and I'm talking about surprise I'm talking about don't get there to be delayed those that be hold backs I'm gonna come seeing that it's ever going to come to pass that with patience hold and wait on the promise let's bring the musicians right now when the promise is delayed sometimes it looks like it's a far off but I want to tell you it's nearer now than when we first believed say brother Tim you preach that come to the Lord since you was a boy yeah and he's come for many it's been a many that's laid right here in front of the pulpit that he came for he could come for you today don't you want to be a part of that great Rapture of the church don't you want to be a pardon under the eagle anointing be anointed by the Holy Spirit to overcome in this day don't you want to do your part to make it come soon don't you want to have a Godly life that others can take Courage by don't you want to press forward what others can take hope because you didn't give up I want you to Bow your heads just a moment part of the end time is scoffers will be in the land Are you a scoffer are you one that says well it'll never happen maybe you believe it'll just never happen for me it could never be for me I'll never get my healing I'll I'll never get my salvation I'll I'll never I'll never receive my children saved I'll never have my home right it can never be listen we serve a god of Miracles and God wants you to believe it could be suddenly I want to repeat back to you suddenly you just grinding right along just slow but sure maybe you prayed the six times and nothing's happened but suddenly it's about to change suddenly things are about to be different suddenly God's going to promote you bring you into a greater area of your life than you've ever been and you look back at the trials that you've been through and say this prepared me for the throne suddenly he will come on the wings of a morning suddenly he'll rise as the sun pops up and breaks over with this early morning Wings shining over the Earth you'll see the sun rise into a glorious day some golden Daybreak Jesus Will Come are you doing your part are we waiting on you are you dragging your feet are you holding the church back well I'll just quit by the Tim although I just won't go to church there if I'm holding y'all back I'll just no if you're a part you can't quit you can't leave you got to get in step wherever you are in your walk Wherever You Are don't let it become or that when God himself stands in front of you like Sarah and she laughs can't believe that I'm too old could never happen to me God I'm past my time it's over with for me you don't have to be that way with you but if you are Sarah if you are that way he's passing by this moment he's coming by your way he's standing at your tent door and say though the promise has been delayed the vision is tarried yet it's going to come to pass Lord help me to believe and forgive me of my unbelief would there be those in this service today that would raise a hand toward God and say Lord forgive me I've got a little cold I've got a little bit of doubting I've had a lot of fears I've had some unbelief there that slipped in I I I'm taking the wrong side even sometimes I've been a scoffer and a doubter but today I want my house in order today I want things that are wrong right in my life I want to come with a new consecration I've seen the promise delayed but I remember you remember I've been reminded that you're a God that don't forget you're a God that pays back our enemies your God that remembers our labors your God that remembers that commitment we made to him when we accepted him as our Lord and savior and he's not given up on us he's not given up on you this morning he's a God that won't give up but all I stand at the door knock If any man will open the door you see it lays within your power to open the doors he knocks why don't you just ask him Lord reveal yourself to me in a greater way I've got a little backslid and a little cold in my life I I'm just not fervent I've become a little bit lukewarm Lord I've let people hurt me I've let things set to be said to me that I took personal and but Lord you never said those things people hurt me preachers hurt me friends hurt me but you Lord you said I'll never leave you or forsake you you're a God who cares [Music] you're right on the verge of your blessing you're right on the verge of your breakthrough you're right on the verge of God moving in your life breaking every barrier breaking every fed her breaking that seal and that doubt of your life you're right on the verge you can hear we can hear the sound of abundance of rain we see the Lord working we see healings in our midst we hear I've been moving there in cave churches down in China preaching down in underground churches we hear a brothers sisters over there that are embracing the truth under terrible persecution them standing for God we hear them going down into the dark jungles of Africa over there in the Far Corners of Asia and down into Burma we hear of it moving in the islands of the Philippines God's moving his calling is elect while he's doing it there's healings there's Miracles there are things that are happening people being filled with the Holy Ghost God's spirit is moving all over the world God's moving right here in the evening like Tabernacle amen there are souls we can look back in this year and we can see Souls that have been saved you know there are many churches go for years not a baptism not a convert you realize how bachelor in the church is that doesn't have converts and baptisms and people come to the Lord that's a backslidden church oh we're little it doesn't matter if you're if you're five or six or twelve if you've got a fire in you you're gonna cause another fire to burn like the candle Wherever You Are what about in your own life how's it shining out to others how's it moving do your part to make it come soon are you in step have you been out a little bit I'll step in your life little void of the spirit hadn't had a breakthrough in years and years isn't a Time isn't it time when the promise is delayed don't scoff don't get cold have patience Lord I don't know how you're going to do it it's bigger than what it ever was but I know you're going to do it it's a greater Miracle than it ever could have been but I know you're going to do it you smoke it I'm gonna have that promise I'm going to embrace it can be mine is my promise I'm not letting go of it I'm a heel grabber and I'm gonna grab hold if it don't come that way I'll do anything I do whatever it takes to get that Birthright I'll get that everything it takes to have that blessing I'm going to be blessed I'm gonna walk in God's blessings I want to see his power in my life will be part of the change taking sides with Jesus ask him today invite him invite him to your pew maybe it looks like you've taken the long way should have got to the promised land a long time ago but God's had to lead you through Red Seas so that you could see his power God had to lead you to desert places we could show you his provider he had to show you third make you thirsty so you'd call out for his water that only he can give he's not allow you to go through Dark Places to bring you out in the light but I've got an announcement the delay doesn't last forever certainly sadly he shows up sadly he moves suddenly comes or if I could have got to it today to realize you know the lamb has taken the book and opened the seals he's brought the revelation of this last day after delaying for thousands of years and now the seven Thunders have uttered their voices and we have heard now what was once mystery not revealed God preparing you for his coming so you wouldn't be behind in any of these spiritual gift God equipping you for Rapture time God turned in your heart to believe again let him turn your heart to believe this morning I want you to say Lord deal with the doubt in my heart deal with the unbelief right there Lord see you know brother Brandon would have to pray all the time God forgive me of sins he never was praying God forgive me I smoked today I drank today I cussed today how long would he's praying we all stumble with unbelief stagger at the promise of God and we have to say Lord I'm sorry I uttered that wrong Lord I I I staggered at the promise forgive me Forgive Me Lord you let me go through this trial and I didn't behave myself wisely but today I want things to be different I mean you're part of a change suddenly suddenly things are different suddenly he moves father take these words today speak to hearts and lives Lord let the Holy Spirit just have its way Lord with him let them just realize that they're in the hour of your coming and in that hour Lord scoffers rise and even sometimes golfers scoffing in our own Hearts like Sarah did scoffing at the promise how could this be may we not scoff may we believe forgive us of unbelief there's times we're down there's times where we're so human we're too human we've been but we've been burnt to be sons of God to rise up with eagles wings May your children that have been beat down and down and in the opponent of the low limbs Feel The Winds of the current of the Holy Spirit today Flex their wing muscles and fly in the heavens for all things are possible in Jesus name amen come Jesus come oh even so come Lord Jesus come amount invite him to take your ride away [Music] it belongs to be with you in mind [Music] even

Jesus comes come on worship with me again one more time [Music] thank you from Lord Jesus come Hallelujah Jesus even so take your right away [Music] even so if I'm Lord Jesus come you know he's talking about the vials being poured out of judgments but when I think about this song we're singing today come Lord Jesus come the last Prayer in the Bible is still a prayer waiting to be answered and that was the prayer of John that said even so come Lord Jesus come [Music] do you know if that's the last prayer of our book The Book of Revelation that's got to be the prayer of our hour there's got to be gotta be people that are praying that same thing saying oh God [Music] leave me here amen I don't want to be left behind the judgments coming on this world troubles us it's keeping up wrath in the Nations trouble the Brewing everywhere storm clouds everywhere but come Lord Jesus come you know when the last seal is was opened it opened up the silence [Music] and in that time what the opening up of the silence there were prayers that were mixed with much incense which are the prayers of the Saints and they ascended it before God and then things began to happen on Earth of thunder lightning and earthquakes [Music] and when I think of that I think of one prayer a prayer that's been [Music] just like biles and judgments that have been stored up waiting for the bride to leave but there are prayers that were stored up the Bible said they were there was a bowl of prayers or vial a prayer a vessel of prayers and these prayers were taken and mixed with much incense and they ascended to God and when he heard them and received them he began to do things on the Earth and there's one prayer that I know he stored up [Music] even so come Lord Jesus come can't you imagine the Saints down to the ages John said it come Lord Jesus come I mean you said it come at my age Lord Paul said we wish our lives and remain Luther said surely he's coming to my age it's my prayer Lord come for the lutherans Wesleyan said his Sanctified us come Lord we're a holy people unto you the Pentecostal set in Azusa Street you poured out gifts surely it's your coming thank you but God had to wait until sin and a prophet in this day to turn our hearts back to the original faith to turn our hearts back to the word again but it's the hour and the time where those prayers are to be mixed within sense and here we are in the coming of the Lord as he brings about his coming and here how did he come in his first time his first coming was with John the Baptist before he comes as a messiah he came with a messenger to prepare the way and here he comes and bright for him in this day and before he does he sends Elijah the prophet I want you to know we are here in the very cycle of his coming and those prayers are being answered and things are happening right now on the earth to pray about the coming of the Lord and it only be our prayer today Lord let me help make it come soon amen
