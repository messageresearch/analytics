[37:20] father truly that's where the hope of
[37:21] the believer is today
[37:24] what i hope is not in the world around
[37:26] us our hope is not in
[37:28] lord
[37:30] politics and things that goes on in this
[37:32] world
[37:34] things may get better
[37:37] things may improve that's that's not
[37:39] where our hope is lord
[37:41] our hope is in you lord
[37:44] our hope is in your return father to
[37:46] come back
[37:48] take us out of this so evil sinful place
[37:52] lord we can leave this place behind lord
[37:54] to go
[37:55] into the eternal realms with you lord
[37:57] that's what we're groaning and longing
[38:00] for father
[38:02] that is the hope of the believer
[38:04] lord we ask father you just help us
[38:06] tonight lord to
[38:08] just follow your unction lord your
[38:10] leadership
[38:11] lord just help us you know the battles
[38:13] we've been in the things lord the
[38:15] devil's tried to do but lord we know
[38:18] that you're more than
[38:19] able to face any situation
[38:22] you're the conqueror of conquerors the
[38:24] god of god and the lord of lords
[38:27] well there's nothing too hard for you
[38:29] father
[38:30] we commit this time into your hands lord
[38:33] bless each and every heart we pray
[38:36] in jesus name
[38:38] amen
[38:40] amen let's turn to psalms 68 and verse
[38:43] 1.
[38:48] [Music]
[38:55] i
[38:57] went to bed last night
[38:59] praying for brother ron just
[39:01] just was really on my heart just
[39:04] all evening pretty much thinking about
[39:06] him and
[39:07] and looking for god to move on his
[39:09] behalf and his situation
[39:11] you know i went to a fellow sleep
[39:13] praying for him and
[39:15] early this morning i was dreaming about
[39:17] him
[39:18] and uh don't really remember anything
[39:20] particular about the dream
[39:23] but uh these words woke me up as if
[39:25] someone spoke to me
[39:27] let god arise
[39:29] and let his enemies be scattered
[39:33] amen let god arise and let his enemies
[39:36] be scattered
[39:37] let them also that hate him fleef before
[39:41] him as smoke is driven away so drive
[39:44] them away
[39:45] as the wax melted before the fire so let
[39:48] the wicked perish at the presence of god
[39:52] but let the righteous be glad
[39:54] let them rejoice before god
[39:57] yea let them exceedingly rejoice
[40:00] sing unto god sing praises to his name
[40:04] extolled unto him that writeth upon the
[40:06] heavens by his name jah or jehovah
[40:09] and rejoice
[40:11] before him
[40:13] amen we let you be seated
[40:18] but these uh these words would ring out
[40:21] in my ears
[40:22] as if somebody was in the room speaking
[40:24] them to me and it would wake me up
[40:27] let god arise
[40:29] and his enemies be scattered
[40:31] to arise is to become powerful
[40:34] in that moment or in that situation to
[40:36] come on the scene
[40:38] scattered means to break or to shatter
[40:41] to dash to pieces
[40:43] and that's what we need
[40:45] today is our god to come on the scene
[40:47] and on our behalf and to become powerful
[40:50] on our behalf
[40:52] to arise amen to scatter the enemies and
[40:55] we know that there is no enemy that can
[40:57] stand before him
[40:59] as the scripture would say is as the
[41:01] smoke their enemy would stand before him
[41:03] as smoke driven away by the wind or as
[41:06] wax would melt before fire so there's
[41:09] nothing that can stand before god
[41:12] there's no sickness there's no sin
[41:14] there's no enemy of any kind there's no
[41:16] demon of any kind there's no satan
[41:18] himself cannot stand before the i am
[41:21] amen and so we see that he he has to
[41:25] come and to become powerful on our
[41:28] behalf in the hour that we're living in
[41:30] that's what it means for god to arise we
[41:33] can go through the scriptures and we can
[41:35] see god arising in the past we can see
[41:37] god moving in the past we can see
[41:40] all the testimonies and things that we
[41:42] can bring up and some that we will but
[41:44] amen we don't really need just the god
[41:46] of the past
[41:48] amen we don't need a god who healed
[41:50] cancer even four or five years ago we
[41:52] need a god who heals cancer today and
[41:55] i'm here to say he's still that same
[41:57] kind of god it doesn't matter what
[41:59] critics may say it doesn't matter what
[42:01] doctor's reports may say it doesn't
[42:03] matter what anybody else has to say god
[42:06] is still god
[42:07] amen when god moves he moves amen amen
[42:11] and so we're looking for him to arise
[42:13] we're looking for him to show himself
[42:15] powerful in the day that we are living
[42:18] them you know it was in jairus house
[42:20] where the doctors had come to their last
[42:22] moments and they had tried all that they
[42:24] had could do and they failed they they
[42:26] had given over the little girl amen to
[42:29] death and and death had come and taken
[42:31] her and had taken his bitter toll and
[42:33] taken the only child of that home away
[42:35] from that family and there she laid
[42:38] stretched out on the couch on the on the
[42:40] couch dead
[42:41] and her broken-hearted daddy a little
[42:43] preacher
[42:44] you know and he had to be he was
[42:46] forsaken by all of his friends and and
[42:48] forsaken by
[42:49] all of his church but he remembered
[42:52] there was a god of history
[42:54] he remembered that there was a god who
[42:55] had raised the dead before he he had
[42:58] read the scripture where god had went to
[43:00] the shunamite woman's house and god had
[43:02] raised that little boy who had died so
[43:04] he said if i could find that god and
[43:06] he's still the same god the same god
[43:09] that raised that boy will raise my girl
[43:11] amen amen and we know the scripture says
[43:14] seek and you shall find knock and it
[43:16] shall be opened unto you and it shall be
[43:18] and ask and it shall be given to you so
[43:21] if you want a god like that start
[43:22] seeking a god like that if you want a
[43:25] god like that start knocking on the
[43:27] doors for a god like that if you want a
[43:29] god to come on your on the behalf of
[43:31] your family or your situation ask and
[43:34] you'll find a god like that he's still
[43:36] the same god amen he said when this god
[43:39] dwelling in a body called jesus the son
[43:41] of god when he was called on the scene
[43:44] therefore jairus called up out of
[43:46] history a god who could raise the dead
[43:49] in the old testament was now standing in
[43:51] flesh in the new amen and he amen and
[43:54] this dead baby through a prophet that
[43:57] that god could come and raise him up to
[43:59] life again and that baby laying on the
[44:02] bed stretched out in little jairus house
[44:04] him knowing that the shunamite woman got
[44:06] her baby back he said that god of
[44:08] history if he could ever be called into
[44:11] action he's the same god today
[44:14] and searching through the land he heard
[44:16] of a man who who had they claimed to
[44:18] have the power and this was jesus
[44:20] called of nazareth whom they all hated
[44:23] but he had called him on the scene for
[44:25] he was the closest representative he
[44:27] could find of a living god
[44:30] and when he was called on the scene a
[44:32] historical god was called up and when he
[44:34] was caught up to the present he acted
[44:37] the same way he did in the past
[44:41] when he spoke to elijah over a dead baby
[44:44] he said let me say this today my brother
[44:46] or sister in this present day when
[44:48] crisis is on at hand when cancer is
[44:51] eating the world up when diseases of all
[44:53] kinds if that same historical god who
[44:57] cleansed the leopard that same god who
[44:59] healed the sick that same god who raised
[45:02] the dead is the same god today
[45:05] he's waiting anxiously for his people to
[45:09] call him on the scene of action
[45:12] i believe this morning it woke me up to
[45:15] say amen i believe god is wanting his
[45:17] people to start calling on him
[45:19] we have a need
[45:21] we have needs in the body we have
[45:23] sicknesses around us we have one of our
[45:26] generals that's been struck down by this
[45:28] cancer amen it's time that we open our
[45:31] mouth and say let the god of history
[45:34] come forth to the present
[45:37] let the same one that healed atlanta
[45:39] buzz go to virginia grotto virginia and
[45:42] heal that man let the same god come on
[45:45] the scene

[45:51] his people to call him on the scene

[45:57] heart that'll stir you to say i gotta

[46:06] one before i gotta find that one who
[46:09] healed this or healed that who delivered
[46:11] this one i gotta find that same jesus

[46:18] amen and you'll find when you find him
[46:21] you'll find a god who's ready to go to
[46:22] battle for you
[46:24] oh hallelujah amen when god fights for
[46:27] his people the enemy is as helpless
[46:30] before them as smoke is before wind
[46:34] come on now amen when god stands up when
[46:37] god arises for his people the enemy no
[46:40] matter what name it is is as helpless as
[46:43] smoke is before wind
[46:46] smoke cannot stand before wind
[46:49] or as helpless as a wax is before fire
[46:52] nothing can stop him as he rises to do
[46:56] battle
[46:58] nothing can stand before him when he
[47:00] decides it's time to rise up
[47:06] oh hallelujah i believe we're at the
[47:08] moment of the greatest rising of god out
[47:11] of history
[47:13] listen i'm looking for the god who has
[47:15] the power of resurrection
[47:18] amen i believe there's a people that's
[47:20] calling for their power and say i want
[47:23] that power in my life
[47:32] the bible says when you see him begin to
[47:35] move
[47:36] he said rejoice
[47:38] because he's here to prove his word as
[47:40] he did in other days
[47:43] hallelujah
[47:44] we can read in mark chapter 4 and verse
[47:47] 35
[47:48] as these thoughts begin to go through my
[47:50] mind early in the morning i thought
[47:51] about this this particular occasion that
[47:54] happened in scripture
[47:57] so the same day when the evening was
[47:59] come
[48:01] he said unto them let us pass over unto
[48:04] the other side now notice he left a lot
[48:07] of
[48:09] details out in that statement
[48:11] but god is not always concerned in all
[48:13] the details
[48:15] because in the details is the enemy and
[48:17] the details of the trials and the
[48:18] details is the situations you're going
[48:20] to face he's just saying let's go on
[48:22] over to the other side in other words no
[48:24] matter what you're going to face i've
[48:26] got the answer for it
[48:28] amen listen jesus knew the winds and
[48:31] waves were coming
[48:33] amen he knew because he knew who was on
[48:35] the other side it was a little maniac
[48:37] over there amen that was crawl calling
[48:40] out for help
[48:41] and that call amen from that man who was
[48:44] caught in that place amen brother
[48:46] branham said every once in a while who
[48:47] would come to himself and he would say
[48:49] lord have mercy on me
[48:52] and that call would go across the sea
[48:54] and reach a god that was now not just a
[48:57] god of history but a god of the presence
[49:01] and that call would cause him to leave
[49:03] and to go to the other side now he
[49:05] wasn't worried about the winds and the
[49:07] waves and the things that were going to
[49:08] go on in between he just knew i had a
[49:11] place i have a place to be and i'm going
[49:13] to be
[49:14] there come on somebody i have a place to
[49:18] be and i'm going to be there i have a
[49:20] marriage supper of the lamb to go to and
[49:23] i'm going to be there it doesn't matter
[49:25] about the winds and the waves and the
[49:27] things that's going on around us what
[49:29] matters he's with us
[49:34] amen
[49:36] this scripture actually
[49:38] let god arise and his enemies be
[49:40] scattered would actually be what moses
[49:42] would even speak there when the when the
[49:45] ark would begin to move when the cloud
[49:48] would begin to move and when that cloud
[49:50] began to move they knew it was time to
[49:51] go
[49:53] and they and they knew that it was you
[49:55] couldn't wait a mile just go the next
[49:57] day you wait till the next day to pack
[49:59] up you'll be left
[50:00] amen they knew when that clout began to
[50:03] move they began to put everything
[50:04] together the tent was folded up things
[50:07] when you saw that happening you started
[50:09] putting your tent up started packing
[50:11] your mules you started putting it all
[50:13] together because you saw that cloud
[50:14] moving and when that ark was put on
[50:16] those priests amen on the priest's
[50:19] shoulders moses would scream out let god
[50:22] arise and his enemies be scattered
[50:26] oh hallelujah amen that's exactly what
[50:29] takes place amen when the priest puts
[50:32] the word on his shoulders and it goes
[50:34] out to preach the word of god amen
[50:36] there's a voice crying out let god arise
[50:40] and an enemy be scattered that's why
[50:42] when the word goes forth cancer can fall
[50:45] off sugar diabetes can fall off sin can
[50:48] fall off because why the word is being
[50:51] packed on the shoulder of the priest
[51:02] when you saw the word move you moved
[51:05] that's where people's getting their
[51:06] problems are they they're not moving
[51:08] with the word
[51:09] they're wanting to camp out on their own
[51:11] ideas and their own thoughts and their
[51:13] own things and they find themselves
[51:15] sometimes in a real predicament
[51:18] could you imagine you thought well
[51:21] today i don't feel like packing up my
[51:23] tent
[51:24] you're out in the desert there and you
[51:25] saw the priests you saw the clouds start

[51:29] start grabbing their stuff start putting
[51:31] it together packing the tent up putting
[51:33] in this place everything in this florida

[51:37] shoulder of the levites and it's going
[51:39] out to following this cloud you know not
[51:41] today
[51:43] now i'm going to stay here
[51:45] and all of a sudden you're watching this
[51:46] as it goes away
[51:48] and you realize that you know the
[51:49] desert's a lot hotter now
[51:52] why because the cloud amen was sitting
[51:55] there keeping those harmful rays off of

[52:01] going to get up and i'm going i'm going

[53:11] realize we're really quick
[53:13] you know what there was some protection
[53:15] under there i miss now
[53:18] it's a little hotter than it used to be

[53:23] they used to get
[53:24] not getting much water as you
[53:26] nourishment and things that i used to
[53:27] get what's happened the clouds moved
[53:33] amen
[53:34] mercy
[53:36] so he says let's go over to the other
[53:38] side
[53:39] it was just as if as he did to there to
[53:42] the children of israel i'm going to take
[53:44] you out of a land i'm going to take you
[53:45] into a land

[53:55] other side
[53:57] hey man let's walk we might be over here
[53:59] in cancer over here and sugar diabetes
[54:02] over here in doubts over here in fear oh
[54:05] let's go on over to the other side
[54:07] because on the other side is full
[54:09] deliverance on the other side there's
[54:11] enough power that'll deliver a man
[54:13] possessed with thousands of demons
[54:16] [Applause]
[54:20] pass on over to the other side
[54:24] when they had sent away the multitude
[54:25] they took him even as he was in his ship
[54:28] and there also were him other little
[54:30] ships
[54:31] and there arose a great storm of wind
[54:33] and waves beat into the ship so it's now
[54:36] full
[54:37] and he was in the honda part of the ship
[54:39] asleep on a pillow and they awakened him
[54:42] and awakened him and said unto him
[54:44] master carest thou not that we perish
[54:47] and he arose
[54:50] he arose
[54:51] and rebuked the wind and said unto the
[54:53] sea peace be still
[54:56] and the wind ceased and there was a
[54:58] great calm
[55:00] let god arise and the enemies be
[55:03] scattered
[55:04] let god arise and cancer have to bow
[55:07] down to him let god arise and depression
[55:10] has to fall away let god arise and peace
[55:14] be still
[55:19] the brandon said i can imagine how he
[55:20] felt
[55:22] he'd had a great day tired
[55:24] been speaking all that day teaching the
[55:26] parables
[55:28] he's exhausted
[55:30] mentally physically
[55:32] in every kind of way because his flesh
[55:34] was a man
[55:37] he got tired as a man
[55:39] he got sleepy as a man
[55:43] that's why it makes him such a great god
[55:46] because he knows what it's like
[55:48] to feel how we feel
[55:52] he knows what it's like to come out of a
[55:54] great amen meeting and how things are
[55:57] wonderful and go back home again
[56:00] amen and have issues and things arise
[56:03] and you don't feel all the hype and the
[56:05] things that went on and you feel so wore
[56:07] out and tired sometimes he knows all
[56:09] about it
[56:11] that's what makes him great
[56:19] he don't just tell you that he knows
[56:22] he knows what you know
[56:26] it's kind of like this
[56:28] and i say this very tenderly
[56:31] because every word it does it doesn't
[56:33] mean a lot but you know people want to
[56:35] give you their sympathy when you've lost
[56:37] a loved one
[56:38] but unless they really been through it
[56:41] they don't know how it feels
[56:43] they try to support they try to do all
[56:45] they can and that's wonderful and
[56:46] thankful for everyone
[56:48] but when somebody comes to you and
[56:50] they've suffered great loss
[56:52] and they've been down that same road
[56:53] they know what that's like to be walking
[56:56] in the shoes you're walking in
[56:59] and they know what it feels like they
[57:00] know the loneliness and the things
[57:02] you're going through and the myths and
[57:04] then and all the problems and situations
[57:06] that arise that you the other folks
[57:08] don't haven't even thought about they've
[57:10] never been there but listen this is god
[57:12] he knows what it's like
[57:15] he's been there
[57:18] he's been through depression he's been
[57:20] through anxiety
[57:22] come on somebody i gotta make you shout
[57:24] when you know your god's been there
[57:27] he's been through sicknesses he's been
[57:30] through strives he's been through
[57:32] arguments he's been through church
[57:34] troubles
[57:34] [Applause]
[57:36] he's been through it all
[57:41] here he is laying in a boat
[57:43] had a great day of healing the sick and
[57:46] teaching his physical strength
[57:48] remember
[57:49] he was just a man in flesh
[57:52] but in spirit he was god
[57:55] all that god had dwelt in that body
[57:58] therefore his body was human it was
[58:00] subject to temptations subject to
[58:03] sicknesses
[58:04] just the same as ours so he knew what
[58:06] it's like to have a headache
[58:08] he knew what it was like for your neck
[58:10] to ache he knew what it was like to have
[58:12] back problems
[58:15] he knew what all these things were like
[58:18] he was a human a man but then on the
[58:20] spirit he was god i and my father are
[58:23] one my father dwelleth in me when john
[58:25] baptized them on the river jordan we see
[58:28] god descended from heaven like a dove
[58:30] and the voice said this is my beloved
[58:32] son in whom i am pleased to dwell in
[58:38] i'm pleased to dwell in
[58:42] so god dwelt in christ and in him was
[58:45] the fullness of the godhead bodily god
[58:46] expressing himself through jesus jesus
[58:50] was the very vindication of god
[58:54] god being a man though jesus being a man
[58:56] physically was tired and weary
[58:59] virtue was gone
[59:02] he said well how could it be god and be
[59:04] a man there's the mystery
[59:07] man dwelling in
[59:09] god dwelling in man
[59:11] same as today the mystery of christ
[59:14] revealed
[59:18] but you see
[59:19] we find him
[59:22] back there resting knowing there was
[59:23] another day ahead of him
[59:25] going to meet this maniac
[59:28] been cutting himself and living out
[59:30] among the devils
[59:33] brothers i believe he knew all about it
[59:36] the father had sent him over there to
[59:37] take care of it but now he's tired and
[59:39] weary and it goes back and it takes his
[59:41] opportunity for a little rest
[59:43] oh crossing the seas
[59:46] head on a pillow
[59:48] don't look much like god resting there
[59:51] the disciples said you know well
[59:53] our day's journey is about over i work
[59:55] for him now we can take up our regular
[59:57] tests let's just start pulling the boat
[1:00:01] let's just put our hands to the oars and
[1:00:02] start pulling the boat
[1:00:05] brother adam said it's just about like a
[1:00:06] bunch of disciples today
[1:00:08] after revival is over
[1:00:11] you know you might as well just settle
[1:00:12] in and you know we're just gleaning from
[1:00:14] it and and you know each man back to his
[1:00:17] own church and take up his own job again
[1:00:20] just pulling at the boat
[1:00:23] amen we find that's what they did while
[1:00:25] jesus was taking his rest and they began
[1:00:27] to talk about the things they had saw
[1:00:29] and how great he was and how wonderful
[1:00:32] the miracles and signs and things had
[1:00:34] had taken place i mean they saw some
[1:00:36] incredible things
[1:00:38] they saw blind eyes be brought back to
[1:00:41] sight again they saw deaf ears uh here
[1:00:43] again they they saw the dumb speak they
[1:00:46] saw the epilepsy but boy that was being
[1:00:48] throwed in the fire be delivered
[1:00:51] they saw some great things
[1:00:54] surely this must be the messiah
[1:00:57] has to be
[1:00:59] they begin to talk to others that wasn't
[1:01:01] even in their group and they find that
[1:01:03] others thought well surely there's no
[1:01:05] man could do this for god it it has to
[1:01:07] be and then they'd find others and say
[1:01:08] well he's a beelzebub he's a fortune
[1:01:11] teller he's nobody
[1:01:13] he's a liar he makes up stories he
[1:01:16] exaggerates the truth
[1:01:24] they saw him cleanse the leper they had
[1:01:27] saw him raise the dead
[1:01:28] they saw him feed five thousand
[1:01:31] with five loaves
[1:01:33] and two fishes
[1:01:35] i read what brother branham talked about
[1:01:36] he said there was somebody that tried to
[1:01:38] say well you don't know how they used to
[1:01:40] make loaves back then
[1:01:41] it was a big load he said well i i'm
[1:01:44] here to tell you a boy brought him in
[1:01:45] his lunch
[1:01:48] a little boy brought him in his lunch
[1:01:50] and you're trying to tell me that these
[1:01:51] was five loaves big enough to feed 5 000
[1:01:58] some lunch box
[1:02:04] amen could you imagine that little boy
[1:02:07] at school
[1:02:09] here comes john in his lunch box again
[1:02:12] feed 5 000.

[1:04:30] going to call it you can call it
[1:04:30] whatever you want to call it all i know
[1:04:32] is once my girl was bald-headed and now
[1:04:34] she got a full head of hair
[1:04:36] and the doctor said there wasn't nothing
[1:04:38] he could do about it so call it what you

[1:05:09] they've seen all these things take place
[1:05:15] and they begin to think about all the
[1:05:17] negative things around him and think
[1:05:18] about that and
[1:05:20] he said brother adam said but you know
[1:05:21] there was this young john there on the
[1:05:23] boat
[1:05:25] his heart was maybe not so scarred with
[1:05:27] so much theology
[1:05:29] no doubt as he screamed out he said

[1:05:34] right here in the ship
[1:05:36] is the one who did all of that

[1:09:21] hind end and get going
[1:09:25] because you're not gonna let somebody
[1:09:26] with stage four cancer outpraise you

[1:09:37] words
[1:09:38] amen there ought to be something within
[1:09:40] you when you see a man in that condition

[1:10:06] say i give up i walk i'm not giving up
[1:10:11] if god be for us who can be against us
[1:10:17] he's still on the ship
[1:10:22] i'm going to tell you right now he's
[1:10:23] proved it more to me
[1:10:25] that he's on the ship
[1:10:26] in these last few months i've lived in
[1:10:28] at any time in my life
[1:10:33] well what about when your mother was
[1:10:34] healed
[1:10:35] and we rejoiced about it didn't that

[1:10:39] but when i can go through storms
[1:10:42] and i know he's still there
[1:10:44] and he's moving even when i can't see
[1:10:47] him working he's working
[1:10:49] even when i can't feel him he's still
[1:10:52] working
[1:11:00] these disciples discussing what they had
[1:11:02] saw and all sudden trouble rose
[1:11:05] he said that's satan
[1:11:06] he ain't going to let you rest very long
[1:11:13] maybe you find yourself resting tonight
[1:11:14] don't worry it's not going to last very
[1:11:16] long
[1:11:17] unless you're on the wrong side maybe
[1:11:20] but if you on the side of the i am he's
[1:11:22] not going to let you
[1:11:24] rest very long
[1:11:26] somebody said it like this said you're
[1:11:27] either in a tr in a trial right now or
[1:11:30] you're just coming out of one or you're
[1:11:32] about to go in another

[1:11:50] water filled up the boat trouble is at
[1:11:53] hand and it happened so suddenly
[1:11:58] all hopes are from survival was gone

[1:12:04] make it
[1:12:08] though they had seen them do all those
[1:12:10] things still trouble stroke struck
[1:12:15] and he said many times when that happens
[1:12:17] that's when you forget
[1:12:19] what he's done
[1:12:21] and who he is
[1:12:22] and he's in your ship
[1:12:26] they had just been talking about him
[1:12:29] they had just been expressing their love
[1:12:31] and appreciation and how and all of a
[1:12:34] sudden we're grounded

[1:12:59] here

[1:13:03] worried about the rigging of republicans
[1:13:05] versus democrats all i know is i've read
[1:13:07] the book of the back of the book and
[1:13:09] it's already been written i'm going to
[1:13:11] be seen over there

[1:13:15] white praising the lamb of god and
[1:13:17] worshipping him with all my heart
[1:13:20] singing a song unto him that the angels
[1:13:22] cannot sing
[1:13:30] he said he said it's about the attitude
[1:13:32] of people we come to church shout praise
[1:13:34] god and our brothers and so forth speak
[1:13:36] the word we can hear the promises we
[1:13:38] praise god for what he's done listen the
[1:13:40] testimonies of one saying i once was
[1:13:42] blind but now i see doctor gave me up
[1:13:44] for cancer two weeks or two days or
[1:13:46] something like that there's one now

[1:13:51] find it no more i i lay bound up in a
[1:13:53] wheelchair paralyzed i walk as good we
[1:13:56] hear all those testimonies but let it

[1:14:02] been enjoying and all those great things
[1:14:04] because it's us now
[1:14:07] but those things happen for a purpose
[1:14:10] they happen to try you
[1:14:12] trouble that we can't remedy it seems
[1:14:14] like the doctors can't remedy it there's
[1:14:16] nothing that it tries to pull ourselves
[1:14:18] away it breaks our oars it fills our
[1:14:21] ships up satan was determined to destroy
[1:14:24] them
[1:14:26] and he's all sort of time don't think
[1:14:27] he's not he is determined to try to
[1:14:29] destroy you
[1:14:39] every time he gets a chance
[1:14:41] here he comes
[1:14:44] as a prophet of god's word every time he
[1:14:47] gets a chance

[1:15:29] and who he is and where he is
[1:15:36] when trouble comes in you can't find a
[1:15:38] remedy that's when fear sets in
[1:15:41] that's what even covert was really about
[1:15:42] we felt like you know people they put
[1:15:44] out there there's no remedy
