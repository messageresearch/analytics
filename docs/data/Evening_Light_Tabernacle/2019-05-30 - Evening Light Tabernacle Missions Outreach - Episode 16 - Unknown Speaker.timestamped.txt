[0:04] we're so glad that you have joined with
[0:07] us today we're the ministry team of Eden
[0:10] and like Tabernacle and we're discussing
[0:12] some wonderful things today about
[0:14] prophecy about the Word of God and we'd
[0:18] like you to share this with your friends
[0:21] and let them know that we're on today
[0:24] and talking about the good things of the
[0:26] Word of God we we've been talking about
[0:29] the clothes of the Jewish dispensation
[0:34] and how that it came tune in and how
[0:37] that the gospel now would turn to the
[0:40] Gentiles and we find out that when Jesus
[0:45] was there looking at the the temple and
[0:50] and they had showed him the great
[0:53] magnificent temple that Herod had built
[0:56] and and where they were worshiping and
[1:00] and Jesus said it's going to come to
[1:05] pass that there won't be one stone left
[1:09] upon another and so you know after this
[1:15] you know he said they asked him
[1:19] questions about it because there's a
[1:21] whole list of events that Jesus speaks
[1:25] about the end time and a lot of people
[1:28] just kind of glossed through all of them
[1:30] but actually they're broken down into
[1:34] three different answers as Jesus answers
[1:37] three different questions and because
[1:39] they said tell us when shall these
[1:41] things be they've not one stone will be
[1:44] left upon another the temple will be
[1:46] destroyed and then what shall be the
[1:48] sign of that coming and of the end of
[1:50] the world so actually three things that
[1:53] Jesus is dealing with so let's talk
[1:56] about those that's a very good
[2:00] observation when shall these things be
[2:04] what shall be the sign of thy coming
[2:06] and the end of the world many times many
[2:11] get confused because when Jesus speaks
[2:14] in Matthew 24 he is speaking to everyone
[2:18] answers to every one of these questions
[2:20] and people misplace time these events
[2:24] with endtime events for example Jesus
[2:28] said pray that your flight not be in the
[2:31] winter nor on the Sabbath day and some
[2:36] people apply that to the world well what
[2:41] why would you apply pray that it not be
[2:44] winter on the Sabbath day if you're in
[2:46] the tropical area you know or what you
[2:49] know pray that your flight not be in the
[2:50] winter if you're in the tropical area or
[2:52] why on the Sabbath day to people that
[2:55] you know this was speaking this
[2:57] particular portion of Matthew 24 was
[3:00] speaking directly to the Jews yes
[3:02] because he knew that Titus was going to
[3:05] come in by prophecy and he said your
[3:07] house is left desolate mm-hmm he knew
[3:10] Titus would come in and actually catch
[3:12] them on the inside of Jerusalem and he
[3:15] was talking to the believers you pray
[3:17] yeah and you watch this side and you
[3:21] pray that your flight not being the
[3:23] winner nor on a Sabbath day because they
[3:25] would the gates would be closed today to
[3:26] be long let me just read it for
[3:28] reference here maybe it would just kind
[3:31] of congeal it for us in Matthew 24 16
[3:34] then let them which be in Judea flee
[3:37] into the mountains let him which is on
[3:40] the housetop not come down to take
[3:42] anything out of his house neither let
[3:44] him which is in the field returned back
[3:47] to take his clothes and woe unto them
[3:49] that are with child and to them that
[3:51] give suck in those days but pray that
[3:54] your flight be not in the winter neither
[3:56] on the Sabbath day so so this was
[4:02] specifically speaking of the destruction
[4:06] of Jerusalem right absolutely correct
[4:08] Titus 80 70 Jesus prophesied in Luke
[4:12] chapter 19 41 an incredible accurate
[4:16] prophecy and this is one of the greatest
[4:21] destructions the world has ever seen and
[4:24] Jesus spoke of it it's historical in
[4:26] Luke chapter 19 verse 41 he said and
[4:29] when he come near he beheld the city and
[4:32] he wept over it weeping over Jerusalem
[4:34] right saying if thou had known at least
[4:37] this thy day the things which belong in
[4:40] to thy peace but now they are hid from
[4:42] thine eyes for the days shall come upon
[4:45] thee that thy enemies shall cast a
[4:47] trench about thee and compassed the
[4:50] amount and keep thee in on every side
[4:53] and shall lay thee even to the ground by
[4:56] children within thee and they shall not
[4:58] leave in the one stone upon the other
[5:00] because thou knewest not the time of the
[5:04] visitation thy visitation
[5:06] so Jesus is looking 37 years ahead to
[5:10] the Roman general Titus 8070 coming in
[5:15] and he literally built a siege wall
[5:18] around Jerusalem starved him out
[5:21] completely and the people ate their own
[5:24] children they ate the bark off the trees
[5:27] they weeds and he killed according to
[5:31] Josephus I believe it was 1.1 million
[5:34] right Jews those that tried to escape
[5:37] they crucified him and hung them around
[5:40] the city and this horrific judgment was
[5:45] spoke up not just by Jesus but this is
[5:48] where Titus brings the temple down to
[5:51] the ground it was it was terrible they
[5:54] they took over 25,000 Jews and made him
[5:57] fight wild beasts in the amphitheaters
[5:59] right they let off thousands and
[6:02] thousands and into captivity yes it was
[6:05] and it's not that they weren't warned
[6:08] Jesus himself had given them a warning
[6:12] well what does it do to us we don't heed
[6:15] the warnings and the word of God but
[6:18] what about the believers what about
[6:20] those who did hear good question because
[6:23] according to Josephus there there was
[6:26] not one Christian less
[6:28] found inside there because they watch
[6:31] for the sign that Jesus spoke of amazing
[6:33] and he said you pray that your flight
[6:35] not been the winner they were praying
[6:37] they were watching and when they saw the
[6:39] sign
[6:39] they took off and not one was caught in
[6:43] that judgment so you know there was an
[6:46] abomination that makes desolate and of
[6:50] course there's a lot of theories and so
[6:51] on about that and maybe different
[6:53] application but I think of one
[6:55] application that is that is real true
[7:01] the abomination that made Israel our
[7:05] Jerusalem desolate was the rejection of
[7:08] the Messiah when there he came standing
[7:12] in the Holy Place and they rejected him
[7:16] this was truly the real abomination that
[7:21] made Jerusalem desolate is because they
[7:25] did not recognize their day their
[7:27] message and their power of visitation
[7:30] that's right and we saw what it did to
[7:33] them I mean they dispersed them and went
[7:36] everywhere they that was scattered
[7:39] scattered I mean it you had 2,000 years
[7:42] of tribulation for the Jews that's right
[7:44] an unbelievable thing I've been in
[7:46] bucking off and off switch and all them
[7:49] death camps and things that's just part
[7:51] of the history but incredible things
[7:53] they dealt with for you terrible
[7:54] persecution because they did not
[7:58] recognize their day in their hour of
[8:00] visitation yes now you just realize what
[8:03] it's going to happen when a rapture
[8:05] takes place and God takes his elect and
[8:08] then the whole world goes into
[8:10] tribulation where the wrath of God is
[8:13] poured out upon a world and upon a
[8:16] people in the vials the bowls of
[8:18] judgment has been stored up and waiting
[8:21] for that time will be poured out on the
[8:24] earth because once again people did the
[8:28] same thing they make they do the
[8:31] abomination that makes desolate yes that
[8:34] is
[8:35] I reject the Messiah well you see what
[8:38] happened to the Jews for that rejection
[8:40] and you think God is gonna take it any
[8:43] less or take it lightly when the
[8:46] Gentiles have done the same thing when
[8:49] they've rejected yes what he's done for
[8:50] them and rejected the word and then
[8:52] turned to their own ideas their own
[8:54] creeds their own traditions they're
[8:56] gonna suffer the same fate that Israel
[8:59] suffered but in a much shorter amount of
[9:01] time
[9:01] he has to be poured out rapidly upon the
[9:04] world yes so then the Ezekiel a prophesy
[9:08] about this is when one of the most
[9:10] accurate prophecies not accurate but one
[9:12] of the most profound prophecies of the
[9:14] Bible he spoke of Titus in depth in
[9:17] Ezekiel chapter 9 and in verse 1 he says
[9:23] he cried also in my ears if you read
[9:26] Ezekiel 8 you'll find that they had
[9:29] desecrated the temple mm-hmm and now the
[9:32] glory of God is departing from the
[9:34] temple mm-hmm and in Ezekiel 9 1 he said
[9:36] he cried in my ears with a loud voice
[9:38] saying every man with a destroying
[9:40] weapon in his hand and behold six men
[9:42] came from the way of the higher gate
[9:44] which lieth toward the north and every
[9:47] man a slaughtering weapon in his hand
[9:49] one man among them clothed with linen
[9:52] with a writer's inkhorn by his side and
[9:56] they went in and stood beside the brazen
[9:59] altar this man in white with the writers
[10:02] inkhorn is the holy spirit and he's
[10:05] going to mark as we read on and the
[10:09] glory of God of Israel was gone from the
[10:12] cherubim whereupon he was of the to the
[10:15] threshold of the house and he called a
[10:17] man clothed with linen which had the
[10:20] writers inkhorn by his side and the Lord
[10:23] said unto him go through the midst of
[10:25] the city through the midst of Jerusalem
[10:27] and set a mark upon the foreheads of the
[10:31] men that sigh and cry for the
[10:32] abominations done in the midst thereof
[10:35] and to the others he said in my hearing
[10:38] go ye after him after the sealing angel
[10:43] through the city and smite and let not
[10:46] your eyes
[10:47] neither have pity slay utterly old and
[10:50] young both maids little children and
[10:52] women but come not near any man upon
[10:57] whom the mark and begin at my sanctuary
[11:01] then they began at the ancient men which
[11:04] were before the house and he said unto
[11:06] them to file the house and fill the
[11:08] courts with the slain go you therefore I
[11:11] go ye forth and they went forth and slew
[11:14] in the city my god and Titus had filled
[11:17] the courts with the slain and it came to
[11:20] pass while they were slaying them I was
[11:21] left I fell upon my face and cried O
[11:23] Lord God wilt thou destroy all the
[11:26] residue of Israel in the pouring out of
[11:28] thy fury upon Jerusalem and he goes on
[11:31] talking about the iniquity of the land
[11:33] this was a direct fulfillment of Titus
[11:36] but before Titus judgment come God sent
[11:41] the sealing angel which was the Holy
[11:43] Spirit which was giving them an
[11:46] opportunity to escape before the
[11:48] judgment God always sends mercy before
[11:50] judgment right this is what is amazing
[11:53] as they saw Jesus and the sign of the
[11:56] Messiah tell the very thoughts of the
[11:58] heart my God and tell them there the the
[12:02] very sins and and seen the healing in
[12:05] the sign of the Messiah and they made
[12:08] fun of it and he said they called him
[12:10] belzebub
[12:11] and he said I'll forgive you but there's
[12:13] one coming after me one word against it
[12:16] see it was before the atonement but
[12:18] after the atonement and God sent the
[12:21] Holy Spirit when the Jews rejected the
[12:24] Holy Spirit and rejected Pentecost yes
[12:26] sir
[12:27] which was the sealing angel right
[12:29] because the seal is the baptism of the
[12:32] Holy Ghost mm-hmm then when a man
[12:35] rejects the light the only thing left is
[12:37] darkness and judgment so we come to
[12:40] another end time and we see also the
[12:44] closing of the Gentile dispensation and
[12:46] the church caught up in tradition and
[12:50] all kinds of different worship that is
[12:53] not scriptural and Biblical kind of very
[12:56] similar to
[12:57] what it is described in Ezekiel chapter
[12:59] 8 and then we see the glory of the Lord
[13:02] leaving between the cherub in other
[13:05] words the Spirit of God is departing
[13:07] from the church system and and there he
[13:12] he's standing at the threshold he's at
[13:15] the door and this is where we find Jesus
[13:17] standing at the door and the outside of
[13:20] the church in laodicea and we find that
[13:23] also the prophecy in Thessalonians where
[13:26] he says the Holy Spirit is lifting he
[13:29] says when they you know let he that let
[13:31] all hell let it and when ìletís will let
[13:34] until he be taken out of the way and so
[13:37] we find the Holy Spirit's lifting from
[13:39] the whole Gentile people yes as the
[13:43] gospel turns back to the Jews but the
[13:45] thing about it is when he is lifting you
[13:49] know we've got to make sure we're part
[13:52] of it that that is lifting with it yes
[13:55] as the world is falling around us that
[13:59] there's a people ascending amen amen
[14:01] amen
[14:02] it's not a part of this fallen world so
[14:05] but there again to go back in this day
[14:07] and reject Pentecost to reject that
[14:10] original experience to turn down the
[14:14] gospel of Christ and the restoration
[14:17] that has happened in this last day leads
[14:19] us to nothing but tribulation once again
[14:22] judgment well Pentecost itself was the
[14:26] pouring out of Jesus spirit from
[14:30] directly from the mercy seat and so
[14:32] essentially when a man receives the Holy
[14:35] Spirit he passes from judgment unto life
[14:39] the Bible said he will not come into the
[14:41] condemnation or judgment but is passed
[14:44] from death unto life so if I am not in
[14:47] Christ I must go to the judgement to
[14:50] answer but if Christ took my judgment
[14:53] then I'm as I am as free as freaking
[14:58] baby so to reject that Pentecostal
[15:02] experience that baptism of the Holy
[15:04] Ghost that seal of the Holy Spirit
[15:07] that becoming a new creature then all
[15:10] there's left his judgment right right
[15:14] but the same as the Ceylon angel there
[15:16] in Jerusalem went through as in Zico's
[15:18] prophecy and then we find though and
[15:21] just so c4 saying no one believer was
[15:24] found there one survivor was find the
[15:26] same in this day when when the rapture
[15:29] takes place every believers going this
[15:31] is exactly right so will be found in the
[15:34] hood imarco knows who's sigh and
[15:37] prophets him not for the abominations
[15:39] done in the city for the sin that's been
[15:42] done you know there there's something
[15:43] that's got to be a part of the real
[15:46] Christian experience today that sin
[15:48] makes you sick yeah yeah absolutely that
[15:50] makes you sigh and cry for the sins that
[15:53] are being done that you know sin
[15:55] literally makes you sick did you say I'm
[15:58] not a part of this yes okay
[16:00] the Bible says to abhor that which is
[16:02] evil to hate you that which is evil and
[16:04] if the Holy Spirit is in us then we are
[16:07] going to yeah well let's see that that
[16:11] goes back to where that we are in our
[16:14] dispensation of time where that you know
[16:17] people are are preaching that we are
[16:20] just saved at sinners that we still have
[16:24] to sin and live in sin and we're we're
[16:27] sinners that were all sinners and that
[16:29] we are but save sinners that the grace
[16:32] of God just is a blanket covering over
[16:35] all of our sins but that's really not
[16:38] the way the gospel works is it that was
[16:40] never the New Testament teaching sure
[16:42] cheapens the blood of Jesus says yes and
[16:44] that's a bad way to describe it right
[16:47] and so you know this is sin you know it
[16:53] they it's just been given a license to
[16:56] sin we just we can't live above it we're
[16:59] going to do it anyway and jesus knows
[17:01] all about it but he shed his blood for
[17:03] us and we're saved sinners but but there
[17:07] should be something that changes the
[17:09] nature that gives a power of overcomes
[17:11] the new birth a new birth and what
[17:14] happiness religion has changed the
[17:17] meaning of the new birth tourists no
[17:19] longer I mean a new birth is a nude as a
[17:23] new nature is the very first doctrine
[17:26] Jesus teach exactly you must be born in
[17:29] other words your law is not going to cut
[17:30] it you he's talking as a Pharisee your
[17:33] laws not it doesn't matter how good you
[17:35] are you must be you must have a nature
[17:37] change a mess so is a seal an angel
[17:40] going forth today absolutely yes and I
[17:43] believe that this is a compound prophecy
[17:45] yeah I believe justice God rung down the
[17:48] curtain on the juice he's ringing down
[17:51] the curtain on the Gentiles
[17:52] mm-hm and I believe that history is
[17:55] repeating itself yeah and there is a
[17:57] sealing angel going through marking
[17:59] those who sign cry for the abominations
[18:01] that are done in this year and just as
[18:04] that there was an abomination that made
[18:07] Jerusalem desolate so so is there an
[18:11] abomination today that make a desolation
[18:14] that will cause massive millions of
[18:20] people to be thrust into tribulation
[18:22] just like the Jews have been for the
[18:24] past 2,000 years and so um we're living
[18:28] in a very serious hour were that we
[18:30] should really make her call an election
[18:33] soon man because we must be filled with
[18:36] the spirit lamps trimmed and clear right
[18:38] because this is the day of redemption
[18:40] that's right this is now the time when
[18:42] the Holy Spirit is lifting from the
[18:44] Gentiles yeah and we turn him back to
[18:46] the Jews again and but when it lifts and
[18:51] as it lifts we want to go with it I mean
[18:55] we want to be a part of that ascension
[18:56] jesus said that we should pray always
[18:59] that we should can escape the things
[19:04] that are coming on this earth and be
[19:06] accounted worthy to stand before the Son
[19:08] of Man racing and how can we be
[19:10] accounted worthy and that's only by the
[19:13] shed blood of Jesus right not just
[19:15] covering our sins and forgiven us of our
[19:18] past but changing our nature
[19:20] annihilate
[19:21] in sin in our life and sin nature and
[19:25] putting us in us the nature of Jesus
[19:27] Christ hey man hey man well god bless
