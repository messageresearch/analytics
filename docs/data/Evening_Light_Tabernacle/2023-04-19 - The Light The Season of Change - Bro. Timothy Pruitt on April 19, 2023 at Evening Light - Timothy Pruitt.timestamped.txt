[37:50] you believe he's great
[37:52] do you know he's great
[37:54] he's a great God Amen and he's worthy to
[37:57] be praised amen that's just by our
[38:00] hearts to him and let's ask the Lord to
[38:03] take preeminence in his service and
[38:05] father we just want to say how much we
[38:08] love you
[38:09] how much we appreciate you and thank you
[38:12] for all that you've done in our lives
[38:14] Lord where would we be without you lord
[38:17] directing and moving and touching we
[38:20] asked father that you had come this
[38:22] evening in a very special way
[38:24] I've asked you Lord to come and touch
[38:26] hearts and lives and I know you've heard
[38:29] my prayer and my request
[38:31] and I asked father that you would just
[38:33] touch lives Lord in a Great and Mighty
[38:36] way father and lift our heads Lord
[38:39] towards the things of God and
[38:41] off of our doubts and off of our fears
[38:43] and unbeliefs and worries and and look
[38:46] to the hills which cometh our help
[38:48] because our Help Cometh From The Lord
[38:51] we as father you take Lord these words
[38:53] and anoint them to our hearts we pray we
[38:56] ask these things in Jesus name
[38:58] [Music]
[39:02] let's turn to habakkuk 2 and verse 2 if
[39:05] you would
[39:06] amen
[39:07] it's good to be thank you good to be in
[39:10] the house of the Lord and
[39:12] and like David I was glad when they said
[39:15] it to me it's time
[39:17] Amen to go to his house and and to hear
[39:20] from him and amen I believe that's what
[39:23] happens amen when a man can set aside
[39:26] his time and energies and labor for the
[39:30] Lord and ask what he what what he would
[39:32] say I believe that's amen the order of
[39:35] the church and the Order of God to speak
[39:37] through a man amen and you but the thing
[39:40] of it is men have to realize it's not
[39:42] just a man it's God speaking
[39:44] amen and so then it can be something to
[39:48] you to help you in a spiritual way I
[39:51] want to say what Lord Willam will be
[39:53] leaving this coming week going to
[39:55] brother Sean Martin's tent meeting and
[39:57] then on to brother Ron Spencer so we
[40:00] covet your prayers and amen with a
[40:02] little bit weakened body but we thank
[40:04] the Lord will recovering and getting
[40:05] stronger so we thank the Lord for that
[40:09] um
[40:09] habakkuk 2 and verse 2 says and the Lord
[40:13] answered me and said write the vision
[40:15] and make it plain upon tables that he
[40:19] may run that readeth it for the vision
[40:22] is yet for an important time
[40:24] but at the end it shall speak and not
[40:28] lie though it Tarry wait for it because
[40:32] it will surely come it will not tarry in
[40:36] other words though it tarry it's worth
[40:38] waiting for
[40:40] amen it's worth waiting for we'll let
[40:43] you be seated like to speak to you on
[40:45] the light the season of change
[40:48] we talked about last Wednesday about the
[40:50] change of seasons and we know many of us
[40:53] we could ask
[40:55] um we could see very quickly in this
[40:58] building there's many
[41:00] people in all various types of seasons
[41:03] of their lives
[41:04] there's many that would be in a winter
[41:07] season as we talked about our summer
[41:09] season but amen as we know seasons
[41:12] change and and God is the god over the
[41:15] season so no matter what season that
[41:17] you're in God is in that moment and in
[41:19] that time and whether it be suffering
[41:21] he's there whether it be heartache he's
[41:23] there whether it be happiness or Joy or
[41:26] or dancing or shouting he's there amen
[41:29] he's in every season of your life and so
[41:33] we know that the word is spoken amen for
[41:35] an appointed time in this time again is
[41:38] a time appointed or time set aside and
[41:41] and so we're not careful as we said last
[41:43] Wednesday we get in a hurry and we want
[41:46] God to change it before he's ready to
[41:48] change it and therefore we'll try to
[41:50] manipulate things or turn things in our
[41:53] own favor to turn things that God is
[41:55] actually trying to do in our lives but
[41:57] as it said though at Terry it is and
[42:00] it's it seems like it's taken a while
[42:02] wait for it and I like that out on it
[42:05] because it's worth waiting for amen when
[42:08] God brings something to fulfillment in
[42:10] your life it's worth waiting for amen
[42:12] because it's for your good amen because
[42:14] it will surely come and it will not tear
[42:17] because what is it saying when the time
[42:19] comes it will not wait another moment
[42:22] amen it won't tarry another moment it
[42:24] may have been years coming to that
[42:26] moment but when that moment is there
[42:27] there's not nothing that can delay it
[42:29] any longer or make it a little go you
[42:32] know go go out further in your life but
[42:34] when God brings that moment in your life
[42:36] it'll happen amen and and sometimes
[42:39] you'll look back and like wow that was
[42:41] so quick that was so amazing how God did
[42:44] that you know and I look at that same
[42:46] word on weight as in Isaiah 40 and verse
[42:49] 28 it says hast thou not known has thou
[42:51] not heard that the Everlasting God the
[42:54] Lord the creator of the ends of the
[42:57] Earth fainteth not neither is weary
[42:59] there is no searching of his
[43:01] understanding he giveth power to the
[43:04] faint and to them that have no might he
[43:06] increases strength amen even the youth
[43:09] shall faint and be weary and the young
[43:11] men shall utterly fail but they that
[43:13] wait they that wait amen that weight is
[43:17] to remain in place in readiness
[43:20] amen that's what the word means it means
[43:23] to remain in place and Readiness or
[43:26] expectation of something or wait your
[43:29] turn or wait your orders or oh wait it's
[43:32] also where the word waiter comes from or
[43:34] waitress comes from it's also has an
[43:37] application of a servitude in these
[43:39] moments amen it's not that you're just
[43:42] dry and Barren and you have nothing to
[43:44] offer but in your waiting moments God
[43:46] can still work through your life God can
[43:48] still touch others in your life God can
[43:51] still minister to others in your life
[43:53] through the times that you're going
[43:55] through it's time that you feel are so
[43:56] hard sometimes people are watching and
[43:59] they're seeing how you react they're
[44:00] seeing what you do during those times
[44:02] and in that it is giving them strength
[44:05] to continue on look at brother Ron he's
[44:07] in the season of seemingly waiting I
[44:09] mean for a moment of a healing of a
[44:12] complete deliverance but during that
[44:13] time of waiting how much does God use
[44:15] that man to stand and proclaim the The
[44:19] Virtuous powers of Almighty God Amen
[44:22] there with that sickness in his body but
[44:24] still saying God still heals God still
[44:26] delivers amen during that waiting God is
[44:29] using him for his glory amen but when
[44:33] the time comes for that appointment that
[44:35] healing they ain't a devil in hell that
[44:37] can stop him amen they can't add one
[44:39] more moment to it he can't add one more
[44:42] second to it but the word will be
[44:44] fulfilled in his life so many times as
[44:46] we said last last week Wednesday many
[44:48] times we find ourselves in seasons of
[44:51] waiting we're waiting on the Lord to
[44:53] move it in a hard situation or a certain
[44:55] situation or maybe some
[44:58] financial help
[45:00] we're often we're waiting on God for
[45:02] many things and but in those seasons of
[45:05] waiting God is there he is using those
[45:07] times just as effectively as effectively
[45:10] as he uses the good times or the hard
[45:13] times he is transforming Us by the power
[45:16] of almighty God into the likeness of
[45:19] Jesus Christ therefore the times of
[45:21] waiting are not wasted
[45:24] they're not wasted amen you may feel
[45:26] like amen you're in a time of Sorrow
[45:28] it's not wasted amen God is working
[45:32] something out of your life and in your
[45:34] life you know I look at the the the
[45:36] children of Israel when they were
[45:38] carried off into Babylon and and I want
[45:40] to go into that for a moment in Psalms
[45:42] 137 and verse 1. amen they found
[45:45] themselves amen now in captivity and a
[45:48] season of captivity in a in a season
[45:51] that wasn't very nice to them they had
[45:53] been taken away from their homes and
[45:54] their lands and and all the things that
[45:57] were familiar to them and they were in
[45:59] sorrow and great sorrow and it says here
[46:01] in Psalms 137 and verse 1 it says by the
[46:04] Rivers of Babylon there we sat down yay
[46:07] we wept when we remembered Zion we hung
[46:10] or hanged our Harps upon the Willows in
[46:12] the midst thereof for their they that
[46:15] for their they that carried us away
[46:17] captive required of us a song and they
[46:20] that wasted us required of us Merc
[46:22] saying sing us one of the songs of Zion
[46:24] how shall we sing the Lord's song in
[46:27] such a Strange Land now they hung their
[46:30] Harps up their song was taken they they
[46:33] seemed that their Destiny or their
[46:34] purpose or their future was in doubt and
[46:37] they were captives both physically and
[46:39] emotionally to them God was far away and
[46:43] he wasn't going to return amen this is
[46:45] where they were in their season as they
[46:47] were taken out in times a time when they
[46:50] didn't feel the worship and the joy they
[46:52] had once felt before they had been
[46:55] brought into this season because of
[46:57] their sin amen you said well what's that
[46:59] have to do with us we have been brought
[47:01] into this falling world because of
[47:04] Adam's sin amen therefore we were born
[47:07] in captivity we were born in sin and
[47:10] shaped in iniquity we we were exiled
[47:13] from the presence of almighty God many
[47:15] times the signs of living in captivity
[47:17] you know is the loss of your dream or
[47:19] the loss of your life or the loss of
[47:22] your joy or the loss of your testimony
[47:24] or the loss of your hope or the loss of
[47:27] your fruitfulness but remember you don't
[47:29] change Seasons you adjust the seasons
[47:33] when it's winter and cold what do you do
[47:35] you go put on a coat when it's summer
[47:37] you take or Springtime comes you take it
[47:39] off and then there's days in the spring
[47:41] you don't know what to wear but you just
[47:42] adjust to what's going on but the good
[47:45] news amen if you're in a winter spring
[47:47] is about to happen and it can happen
[47:49] very suddenly in your life amen it can
[47:52] happen in just a moment the season can
[47:54] change and you look back and you say how
[47:57] did I even make it through winter time
[47:58] and here you are now standing in Spring
[48:01] but God was watching over your life and
[48:04] ordaining you during that season to walk
[48:06] a certain time but when the time come to
[48:09] change it change and the moment changed
[48:12] in your life suddenly amen you can be
[48:14] full of sorrow and suddenly you become
[48:17] become full of joy suddenly change can
[48:20] fall off and freedom be released
[48:22] suddenly you can be Barren and suddenly
[48:25] you can be full of life amen yea this is
[48:28] what the change of season I want to go
[48:30] through some of these changes of this
[48:32] word and and 2 and verse 1 and again I'm
[48:35] gonna go through a bunch of scriptures
[48:36] so yeah you just just follow along as
[48:38] you can with the day of Pentecost was
[48:40] fully come they were with all all with
[48:43] one Accord in one place and suddenly
[48:46] there came a sound from Heaven as a
[48:48] rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all
[48:51] that in the house they were sitting and
[48:53] they appeared unto them cloven tongues
[48:55] like as a fire and it's set upon each
[48:57] one of them and they were all filled
[48:59] with the Holy Ghost and begin to speak
[49:01] in other tongues and spirit gave them
[49:03] mutters and and and so listen at one
[49:06] time we had deniers
[49:08] we had people that had walked away we
[49:11] had all kinds of things but they began
[49:13] to move in another a moment another time
[49:15] and and focus their attention not
[49:18] towards their faults and towards their
[49:19] failures but towards their God and how
[49:21] he told them to tarry in Jerusalem and
[49:24] they were both over their focus began to
[49:26] move into that realm and suddenly they
[49:29] were no longer deniers they were Sons
[49:31] and Daughters of God they were no longer
[49:34] Sinners and away from God they had been
[49:36] changed their season of Life had changed
[49:39] very suddenly amen Paul as he was known
[49:42] as Saul was on his way to persecute the
[49:45] Church of the Living God he throwed many
[49:47] in jail he'd gave many stripes but the
[49:49] Bible says in Acts chapter 9 and verse 3
[49:52] it says as he journeyed he came near
[49:54] Damascus and suddenly they're shined
[49:57] around him about a light from heaven and
[50:00] he fell to the Earth and heard a voice
[50:01] saying Saul Saul why persecuted me and
[50:04] he said who art thou Lord and the Lord
[50:06] said I am Jesus whom thou persecuted is
[50:09] it hard for you to kick against the
[50:11] Pricks and he trembling astonished said
[50:13] Lord what will you have me do and the
[50:16] Lord said arise and go into the City and
[50:19] it shall be told what thou must do so oh
[50:22] one at one moment he's on his high horse
[50:24] suddenly is down in the ground looking
[50:27] up at a light and everything changed in
[50:29] his life
[50:31] amen it can happen suddenly
[50:35] can I drop this in about your children
[50:38] they may be on their high horse right
[50:40] now they may be on their road down the
[50:42] wrong path and doing the wrong things

[51:07] omnipotence speaks the miraculous takes
[51:10] place I believe we're at the season of
[51:12] change amen we say well what's the
[51:15] season of change the change of these
[51:17] mortal bodies and omnipotence is going
[51:20] to speak and when it speaks miraculous

[52:59] came a leper and worship him saying Lord
[53:01] if thou will thou can't make me clean
[53:04] and Jesus put forth his hand and touched
[53:08] him saying I will
[53:10] be thou clean and what immediately his

[53:21] was cleansed listen that leprosy is a
[53:24] type of sin

[54:30] the son of man hath power on the earth
[54:32] to forgive sins he said that to the sick
[54:35] of the palsy I say unto thee arise and

[54:41] house and immediately he rose and he
[54:44] took up his bed
[54:48] say what you want to about the chosen
[54:50] but when they portrayed that down there
[54:51] at that pool of Bethesda and Peter come
[54:54] up to that man and said you know he told
[54:56] you to take up your bed because you're
[54:58] not coming back
[55:01] oh my God Amen too many times God will
[55:04] lift us up and we'll leave our bed there
[55:07] as a crutch to go back to

[55:15] to linger you'll go right back to them
[55:17] listen people can be delivered in a
[55:19] prayer line and walk out delivered and
[55:21] the next day filled with Spirits again
[55:25] demons have ever had all kind of Hell
[55:27] taking over their bodies why they didn't
[55:29] get rid of the bed
[55:32] what they've laid on for years and
[55:34] they've lagged around on and they've
[55:36] been a crutch to them he did this to me
[55:38] and he done that to me it's nothing but
[55:40] a bear Jesus said you're healed get rid
[55:43] of the bed
[55:45] allow forgiveness to flow through your
[55:48] life
[55:50] or you'll go back
[55:53] and he went he immediately arose and
[55:56] took up the bed and went for it before
[55:58] them all ain't so much they were all
[56:00] amazed and glorified God saying we never
[56:02] saw it on this fashion
[56:06] well you let me tell you they never saw
[56:09] it on the fashion that's about to happen
[56:14] all of a sudden gray hair is going to go
[56:16] back wrinkles are going to disappear old
[56:19] age is going to disappear spirits of of
[56:23] hell are going to be bound
[56:25] they ain't never gonna they've never saw
[56:27] it on the fashion that's about to take
[56:29] place amen you're talking about
[56:31] amazement Mark chapter 10 and verse 46
[56:33] and said they come to Jericho and as he
[56:36] went out of Jericho with the disciples
[56:37] and a great number of people blind
[56:39] Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus said by
[56:42] the highway side begging and when he
[56:44] heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he
[56:46] began to cry out and say Jesus thou son
[56:49] of David have mercy on me and many
[56:52] charged him to hold his peace
[56:54] you know who was charging him to hold
[56:56] his peace those who had eyes
[57:01] come on now
[57:03] they wasn't the blind man
[57:05] they hadn't been in that season
[57:08] they hadn't been in that moment and
[57:10] they're saying hold your peace you're
[57:12] talking to me I've been born blind and I
[57:15] have this blindness and I have an
[57:16] opportunity that I can receive healing
[57:18] and you want me to remain quiet
[57:23] This Is My Season of change
[57:26] reminds me of the young boy that brother
[57:28] Brandon prayed for in the wheelchair I
[57:30] believe it was and he was going around
[57:32] testifying of of the of the power of God
[57:35] still in a wheelchair
[57:37] but testifying and then you know it's
[57:40] supposedly putting a stain on the gospel
[57:42] as they said and he said you're making a
[57:44] mockery of it and he said why would you
[57:46] take from me the only hope that I got
[57:50] why would you take from me the only hope
[57:52] that I've got and he said in the name of
[57:54] Jesus Christ I'm Healed
[57:57] and at that moment he stepped up out of
[57:59] that wheelchair and walked out of there
[58:04] come on now when you recognize it's not
[58:07] just a man coming through the building
[58:08] it's Jesus and I need a season of change
[58:12] I need a marked moment in my life that I
[58:15] know God Made Me
[58:18] why would you hold me back
[58:29] Jesus that cry
[58:32] brother Brown said stopped heaven
[58:39] that cry
[58:41] stopped heaven
[58:43] and Jesus Stood Still
[58:46] others were mocking him others were
[58:48] saying all kinds of things about him
[58:50] others were trying to quieten it down
[58:51] others are trying to do whatever they
[58:53] wanted to do but this blind man stopped
[58:55] Jesus
[58:57] by cry
[58:58] and commanded him to be called in the
[59:01] blood they called the blind man saying
[59:03] unto them be of good Comfort rise and he
[59:06] called a thee and he casting away His
[59:09] Garment
[59:12] he knew he wasn't going to need that
[59:13] Beggar's garment no more
[59:15] his season was about to change he rose
[59:19] and he came to Jesus amen and Jesus said
[59:23] what will thou should do to thee and the
[59:25] blind said Lord that I might receive my
[59:27] sight and Jesus said go thy way thy
[59:30] faith has made thee whole and
[59:32] immediately he received a sight
[59:35] hallelujah amen Luke chapter 8 and verse
[59:38] 43 says a woman having an issue of blood
[59:41] 12 years which has spent all over living
[59:43] upon position neither could be healed of
[59:45] any but came behind him and touched the
[59:48] border of His Garment and admittedly her
[59:50] issue of blood stopped
[59:56] others were trying to keep her away
[59:59] they knew what it would be for a bloody
[1:00:01] woman to touch a priest or to touch him
[1:00:04] and you would be unclean
[1:00:09] she had a need
[1:00:14] I don't care how vital Center you are
[1:00:17] Jesus is willing to take on your
[1:00:19] uncleanness
[1:00:23] it doesn't matter
[1:00:25] he's able
[1:00:27] this Blood
[1:00:29] is powerful enough
[1:00:32] amen
[1:00:33] Hallelujah
[1:00:34] Acts chapter 3 and verse 6 Peter said
[1:00:37] Silver and Gold Have I None
[1:00:40] but such as I have give I to thee in the
[1:00:43] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up
[1:00:46] and walk
[1:00:47] and he took him by the right hand and he
[1:00:49] lifted him up and immediately his feet
[1:00:51] and ankle bones receive strength and he
[1:00:53] leaped up stood and walked and entered
[1:00:55] with him to the temple walking and
[1:00:57] leaping and praising God and all the
[1:00:59] people saw him walking and praising God
[1:01:01] and they knew that it was he that sat by
[1:01:03] the arms of beautiful gate of the temple
[1:01:06] and they were filled with wonder and
[1:01:08] amazement of that which had happened
[1:01:10] unto him
[1:01:12] but God rich in Mercy
[1:01:16] but going back to Israel
[1:01:22] they didn't stay in captivity forever
[1:01:25] God had a promise over their life and
[1:01:28] there was a time the season was going to
[1:01:30] change
[1:01:32] God was going to remember his people
[1:01:34] or did another couple Wednesdays tonight
[1:01:36] my brother Carmen God remembers
[1:01:40] it's not that he's forgotten it's just a
[1:01:42] time for something to be fulfilled
[1:01:45] so God remembers and then I want to read
[1:01:47] about them coming back in Psalms 126 he
[1:01:51] said when the Lord turned again the
[1:01:52] Captivity of Zion we were like them that
[1:01:56] dream
[1:01:58] you ever been there
[1:01:59] you have something so good to you has
[1:02:01] happened it's almost like you're
[1:02:03] dreaming
[1:02:04] that's how you're painting yourself and
[1:02:06] like is this really real and you're
[1:02:08] trying to look around he said we were
[1:02:10] like them that dream
[1:02:12] then was our mouth filled with laughter
[1:02:15] and our tongue was singing then said
[1:02:19] they among the Heathen the Lord hath
[1:02:21] done great things for them
[1:02:26] the Lord had done so much for them that
[1:02:28] the Heathen had to testify
[1:02:31] God's at work this is the Lord's doing
[1:02:35] Hallelujah this is the Lord's doing only
[1:02:38] God can do this
[1:02:41] Hallelujah and the Lord hath done great
[1:02:44] things for us whereof we are glad he has
[1:02:47] turned our captivity oh Lord as the
[1:02:50] streams in the South and they that sow
[1:02:52] in tears
[1:02:54] listen to the season change shall reap
[1:02:57] enjoy
[1:02:57] [Applause]
[1:02:58] [Music]
[1:03:00] Hallelujah you may have been balling
[1:03:03] buckets of Tears this way but don't
[1:03:05] worry
[1:03:07] you're just seeing the suffering but get
[1:03:09] ready for the glory
[1:03:12] the glory of God is about to be released
[1:03:15] and your tears will be turned to Joy
[1:03:20] Hallelujah and he that goeth forth and
[1:03:23] weepeth bearing precious seed shall
[1:03:27] doubtless come again with rejoicing
[1:03:29] bringing in the sheafs
[1:03:33] Hallelujah you don't know the power of
[1:03:35] the sea that's on the inside of you is
[1:03:37] not to just have one little tiny plant
[1:03:39] one little tiny piece of fruit one
[1:03:42] little tiny thing in your life no sir
[1:03:44] it's a is that things that seed lays
[1:03:47] Every Blessing of almighty God in that
[1:03:49] moment of your life in that little place
[1:03:51] of your life lays everything God has for
[1:03:53] you
[1:03:56] there's power in the sea and you might

[1:06:54] a footnote about the harps
[1:06:58] it says here
[1:06:59] we hanged our Harps upon the Willows
[1:07:03] this man said these
[1:07:05] words are not without great probability
[1:07:08] but and and are the words of some holy
[1:07:10] Levites who were been accustomed to
[1:07:13] music both vocal and instrumental in the
[1:07:16] temple of God
[1:07:17] he said Harps are put here speaking of
[1:07:20] all instruments of music
[1:07:22] he said it is further to be observed
[1:07:25] that Harps were used by the Greeks in
[1:07:28] mourning
[1:07:29] but they were used by the Hebrews in
[1:07:32] rejoicing
[1:07:36] Hallelujah I don't want to be a Greek
[1:07:39] apologize I don't want to be one I want
[1:07:42] I am a blood-bought Son of God Amen I am

[1:07:47] spiritual seed spiritual Israel amen
[1:07:50] that's who I am
[1:07:51] therefore I will not use amen my but my
[1:07:55] gift or what God has given or the the
[1:07:57] instruments for mourning no sir they are
[1:08:00] to rejoice and see the Praises of
[1:08:03] almighty God

[1:10:27] just listening to the Supernatural
[1:10:29] series and brother Branham was you know
[1:10:31] at the beginning of all that he started
[1:10:32] bringing he said give me your hard case
[1:10:34] hardest cases
[1:10:36] and he'd bring him up and he would he
[1:10:38] would show that God was a God sometimes
[1:10:40] he prayed an hour and 45 minutes
[1:10:42] and then all of a sudden it would break
[1:10:44] and then they started having Miracle
[1:10:45] lines after even the angel warned him
[1:10:48] said don't do that
[1:10:49] he said because you're putting you're
[1:10:51] putting what it was that he was making
[1:10:53] it where the people would only have
[1:10:55] faith if they saw a miracle
[1:10:59] that's not what God wants
[1:11:01] God wants you to have faith before
[1:11:04] miracle
[1:11:08] and so after he would come to the moment
[1:11:10] and it goes down to the point he asked
[1:11:12] God he said Lord if I've been wrong show
[1:11:14] it to me let me tell you God showed him
[1:11:16] very plainly because they had a miracle
[1:11:18] line the girl there was deaf and barely
[1:11:20] could hear before it was over she
[1:11:22] couldn't hear lick
[1:11:23] got worse and worse second person he had
[1:11:25] to shut it down and he began he had to
[1:11:27] repent before God and make it right he
[1:11:30] come he actually came back and he said
[1:11:33] look I've been wrong I'm thankful for a
[1:11:36] prophet like that
[1:11:37] I've been wrong I've done something God
[1:11:39] told me not to do he's then he began to
[1:11:41] explain he said listen God Wants You
[1:11:43] amen not to have faith because you saw
[1:11:46] something God wants you to have faith
[1:11:48] even before you see anything happen
[1:11:52] see he said I'm the one that prays he
[1:11:54] said but you're the one that has faith
[1:11:57] come on now listen it ain't all about
[1:12:00] all that's going on up here or out there
[1:12:02] you have to have the faith I believe
[1:12:05] right now a season can change so quickly
[1:12:07] in this service and it'd be over with
[1:12:11] but all it says Lord be somebody to say
[1:12:14] God I need that moment with you I need
[1:12:17] that to come on my mind my bench my Pew
[1:12:20] my heart
[1:12:30] so when we come there to that great
[1:12:31] wedding supper
[1:12:33] the season of change
[1:12:35] and we look across the table at one
[1:12:37] another
[1:12:38] oh God
[1:12:40] just a slip a little handshake over with
[1:12:42] tears of joy running down our cheeks
[1:12:45] but the king will come out in his Beauty
[1:12:48] and he'll wipe every tear from our eyes
[1:12:52] and he'll say don't cry
[1:12:54] it's all over now
[1:12:56] there'll be no more healing campaigns
[1:12:59] no more tired restless nights no more
[1:13:02] wheelchairs Graves or sickness oh that
[1:13:05] great day when you'll say father enter
[1:13:08] into the joys of the Lord I long to hear
[1:13:10] you say that
[1:13:12] we are in that season
[1:13:15] when the Great supper set and we sit
[1:13:17] across the table the wedding supper I
[1:13:19] look across the table I say I recognize
[1:13:21] him he's from Finland I recognize him
[1:13:22] he's in that area meeting I reach across
[1:13:24] the table and I take you by the hand and
[1:13:26] we shed a few tears won't you won't we
[1:13:28] he said the first thing you know the
[1:13:30] king will walk out and all his Beauty
[1:13:32] he'll take his hands and he'll wipe all
[1:13:34] the tears from our eyes he'll put his
[1:13:36] arm around you and say don't cry now
[1:13:38] it's all over he said there won't be no
[1:13:41] more healing Services no more hot nights
[1:13:43] No More Tears no more wheelchairs no
[1:13:46] more crutches it'll all be over enter
[1:13:49] you into the joys of the Lord I want to
[1:13:52] be there
[1:13:53] don't you
[1:13:58] said thinking that sometime when life is
[1:14:00] all over the last prayer is set on here
[1:14:02] on Earth
[1:14:03] and the Bible's closed
[1:14:06] and we come down to the end of the road
[1:14:08] and we enter into his Joys up there
[1:14:11] I just wonder when that great supper
[1:14:13] said that last supper setting down lines
[1:14:15] thousands of miles
[1:14:17] crosses will sit across the table
[1:14:18] because I'm telling you now it's going
[1:14:21] to be a glorious time
[1:14:23] we'll look across the table to one
[1:14:25] another and see those veterans who
[1:14:27] fought to win the prize sail through
[1:14:29] bloody Seas I guess we'll shake each
[1:14:31] other's hand no doubt
[1:14:33] a little tear will drop down our cheeks
[1:14:36] King will come out
[1:14:37] and he'll wipe the tears from our eyes
[1:14:40] and say don't cry
[1:14:42] it's over now
[1:14:45] we're in the season of change
[1:14:50] many times you know we get under
[1:14:52] pressure
[1:14:54] we get under things in our lives we have
[1:14:57] worries we have doubts we're still human
[1:14:59] Daniel was put in a pressurized moment
[1:15:02] in Daniel 2 and verse 19.
[1:15:05] and his life was actually laying on the
[1:15:07] line
[1:15:09] and it says then was the secret revealed
[1:15:12] unto Daniel in a night vision
[1:15:16] in other words when it was night God
[1:15:18] still gave him sight
[1:15:21] in The Darkest Hours God still got
[1:15:23] Daniels
[1:15:24] that can look through the darkness and
[1:15:27] God give them Vision in the night he
[1:15:29] said then Daniel blessed the god of
[1:15:31] heaven and Daniel answered and said
[1:15:33] blessed be the name of our God forever
[1:15:35] and ever for wisdom and might are his
[1:15:39] he changes the times and the seasons
[1:15:42] he removed with Kings and he Sabbath up
[1:15:45] Kings
[1:15:48] hello somebody
[1:15:50] he allows things to rise and he'll tear
[1:15:53] them down
[1:15:54] he'll allow walls to be built around his
[1:15:56] children but when it was a time for
[1:15:58] their freedom they were tore down
[1:16:01] he rises raises Kings and he set it down
[1:16:04] Kings he'd give us wisdom to the wise
[1:16:07] and knowledge to them that no
[1:16:08] understanding he revealeth the deep and
[1:16:10] secret things he knoweth what is in the
[1:16:13] Darkness
[1:16:19] a dark moment he knows what's in there
[1:16:24] Hallelujah he's already got the answer
[1:16:26] for you and the light dwelleth with him
[1:16:28] I think the impraisal Lord oh god of my
[1:16:31] fathers who have given me wisdom in my
[1:16:34] and hath made known unto me now what we
[1:16:36] desire of thee for thou has no now made
[1:16:40] known unto us the king's not
[1:16:45] we are
[1:16:46] then we're walking in darkness but God's
[1:16:48] given us a vision to see
[1:16:51] and he's made known to us not some
[1:16:54] Earthly King not some King that is has
[1:16:57] our evil dominion over our no no he's
[1:17:00] given us amen the king's matter he's
[1:17:03] allowed us to see what it's all about
[1:17:05] where we are the times and the seasons
[1:17:09] what's about to happen and we can say
[1:17:11] hey A change is about to take place
[1:17:16] he's made known to us the king's matter
[1:17:25] the king knows what season you're in
[1:17:32] I I want you to understand
[1:17:35] these notes and things have been on this
[1:17:37] iPad since about Friday
[1:17:40] Saturday and Sunday
[1:17:42] was a culmination of some real emotions
[1:17:46] in my life
[1:17:47] and we'll be real real for a moment
[1:17:53] about four years ago I was looking to go
[1:17:55] into business and seemed like the Lord
[1:17:57] was setting up some things
[1:17:59] very it just looked like the Lord
[1:18:02] and so I had made these plans the plans
[1:18:05] were in place and things were moving and
[1:18:07] I went up to brother Rollins to minister
[1:18:10] and went and ate dinner with him at his
[1:18:12] house
[1:18:13] next morning at the service or the next
[1:18:16] morning actually when they had Sunday
[1:18:17] night Saturday night Sunday night at
[1:18:19] that time
[1:18:20] but we went up on the mountain on a
[1:18:22] Sunday morning and he said
[1:18:24] y'all heard y'all heard the testimony at
[1:18:26] camp
[1:18:27] about without and I think there's a name
[1:18:30] held it
[1:18:31] oh no the brothers got the greenhouse
[1:18:35] Aiden really Aiden
[1:18:37] and that was powerful how big was it
[1:18:41] when I prayed 10 by 20. how big is it
[1:18:44] now five acres Greenhouse
[1:18:48] and so he pulled me aside on the side of
[1:18:51] that mountain was looking over that
[1:18:52] beautiful Shenandoah Valley
[1:18:55] and he said this is the time he said
[1:18:56] brother Timothy I'm just going to tell
[1:18:57] you he said I went to lay down after you
[1:19:00] left yesterday and said I couldn't sleep
[1:19:01] went in my office and I um
[1:19:05] just got quiet before the Lord and he
[1:19:07] began to speak to me about you
[1:19:09] and I hadn't spoken a word to brother
[1:19:11] Ron
[1:19:12] about what I was my plans
[1:19:14] and he says God said to you're not to go
[1:19:16] into business
[1:19:18] he said but God said tell him he's my
[1:19:20] servant I'll take care of him
[1:19:25] he said now I've talked to brother Aiden
[1:19:27] I've talked to another brother up in BC
[1:19:29] and God has exploded their business he
[1:19:31] said even you know me and my sons we
[1:19:34] have a thing that we do he said but
[1:19:36] that's not for you that's not what the
[1:19:37] Lord this is I'm just telling you what
[1:19:39] the Lord told I took it it's from the
[1:19:41] Lord
[1:19:42] and I saw very quickly my situation
[1:19:45] changed
[1:19:47] and and God provided all these four
[1:19:49] years he's provided over and abundantly
[1:19:51] but just in these last couple of months
[1:19:54] things begin to change and I saw the
[1:19:57] change that was taking place and and I
[1:19:59] saw that very quickly things were
[1:20:00] changing financially and unexpected
[1:20:02] things were happening and I'm wondering
[1:20:04] what do I do and so you're trying to in
[1:20:07] your moments of worry and fear you try
[1:20:09] to figure this out and you're digging
[1:20:10] yourself deeper and you're digging
[1:20:12] yourself deeper and then the devil's on
[1:20:14] you're like well see you could go do
[1:20:15] this and you could go do that and I you
[1:20:17] know you left this job that was paid now
[1:20:19] paying this much see what you know the
[1:20:21] Lord's really taken care of you and all
[1:20:22] this stuff you know mind battles
[1:20:27] and then you know Sister Ruth going
[1:20:29] through what she's going through and and
[1:20:30] the devil's laughing at me about that
[1:20:32] and all that so Saturday evening my
[1:20:34] emotions are so raw and they come to the
[1:20:36] front and then Sunday after I led to
[1:20:38] sing and I went to the back and I just
[1:20:40] got on that couch back there and I just
[1:20:41] cried out to God I said God I I need
[1:20:44] some I need you to move
[1:20:46] I said because I don't want to get
[1:20:48] bitter I I want to stay right in this
[1:20:50] season I I know it's a test and I I
[1:20:53] don't want to fail this test
[1:20:55] but Lord I'm at my end I don't know what
[1:20:57] to do
[1:20:58] I don't know where to turn
[1:21:01] and so
[1:21:02] fast forward to Monday morning me and
[1:21:05] brother Tim decided to go get some
[1:21:06] groceries I jumped in the car with him I
[1:21:08] went and got a few for our house and we
[1:21:10] come back we saw sister Ruth and and
[1:21:12] Katie and his sister Emily walking up
[1:21:15] the highway and so we went on into the
[1:21:17] house and took the groceries in and I
[1:21:19] was sitting there on the couch and just
[1:21:21] had got a text or something or just
[1:21:22] finished talking and by the time my wife
[1:21:24] walks in she said hey here's a card for
[1:21:27] you
[1:21:28] I said car and I looked at it
[1:21:30] and uh

[1:21:48] I don't I don't go to the mailbox sister
[1:21:50] Ruth she gets aggravated with me
[1:21:53] sometime when we drive by and I was like
[1:21:54] ain't stopping
[1:21:59] so I get this card it says with
[1:22:01] appreciation some lives are true
[1:22:02] reflections of God's love
[1:22:05] sending a prayer of thanks to God and a
[1:22:07] note of thanks to you brother Timothy
[1:22:09] God knew what he was doing when he put
[1:22:11] you in our lives

[1:22:24] I flipped that thing over

[1:24:58] brother Jason Jackson would send me this
[1:25:00] note on Monday he said I got a thought
[1:25:02] yesterday I was studying on today your
[1:25:04] moment with the King
[1:25:07] Esther seven and eight she got to
[1:25:10] express to King what her problem was and
[1:25:12] he granted her every request she had
[1:25:16] he said you had your moment when you was
[1:25:19] pouring out your heart to him but today
[1:25:21] he's hung Cayman
[1:25:27] season changed he said but as an
[1:25:29] Esther's case there wasn't the dearest
[1:25:32] that wasn't the deer's need it was to
[1:25:34] spare her people from a decree that
[1:25:37] could not be reversed but what the king
[1:25:40] did he put a degree in effect before the
[1:25:43] first could come into effect
[1:25:46] Hallelujah I want you to tell that devil
[1:25:49] you may have decrees over my life but
[1:25:51] there's a decree over me before you ever
[1:25:54] spoke
[1:25:56] Hallelujah and you don't dictate what
[1:26:00] season I am the king first
[1:26:03] says where I'm at the king says who I am
[1:26:06] I am a Son of God I have a daughter of
[1:26:09] God this is my season and for certain
[1:26:12] time is it I have been placed here
[1:26:18] Hallelujah I want you to know there's a
[1:26:21] decree over your life before the devil
[1:26:24] ever said anything about you
[1:26:25] [Applause]
[1:26:28] Paris there's a decree over your
[1:26:31] children before the devil ever had one
[1:26:33] thing to do with him
[1:26:36] Hallelujah and you don't know the moment
[1:26:38] it's going to change
[1:26:44] again in the history don't give up on
[1:26:47] the promise

[1:27:07] let me tell you parents that God gave me
[1:27:10] something that's just a temporary thing
[1:27:13] and he was concerned about a temporary
[1:27:15] matter

[1:27:31] concerned about your Eternal thing

[1:27:37] shall be there and they're Offspring
