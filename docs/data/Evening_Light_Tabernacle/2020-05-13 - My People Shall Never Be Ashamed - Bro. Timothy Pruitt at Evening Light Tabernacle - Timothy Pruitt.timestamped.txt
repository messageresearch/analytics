[9:10] evening able to come to your home
[9:12] wherever you are let the Holy Spirit
[9:15] just move in your life and your heart I
[9:17] pray that you'll just enter into this
[9:20] service with all your heart tonight I
[9:22] believe he's worthy of being praised and
[9:24] his name glorified so let us lift up the
[9:28] name of Jesus we also want to remember
[9:31] the needs tonight of the bride around
[9:34] the world of course as many of them are
[9:37] suffering because of the situations that
[9:40] are going on I received requests from
[9:43] different places asking for help because
[9:47] they can't work they don't have food so
[9:50] there's many many needs that are
[9:52] different places around the world and
[9:54] we're blessed tonight and we want to
[9:59] tonight just remember those that are in
[10:01] need those that are in prison for the
[10:04] gospel of Christ there's a young man
[10:06] with a wife and a young child that's in
[10:10] the nation of Turkey and his visa has
[10:13] been rejected and he's gonna be sent
[10:16] back to Iran and he is sure to be
[10:20] imprisoned and beaten just for preaching
[10:23] the gospel of Jesus Christ and so he has
[10:28] appealed his case but unfortunately the
[10:30] cases they the courts are all closed so
[10:32] it's really going to take a miracle for
[10:34] him not to be deported and and it's a
[10:37] very very situation bad situation also
[10:40] there are those that are in the other
[10:43] type of prison and chains maybe it's a
[10:47] sickness in their body our brother Ron
[10:49] Spencer still needs a touch some of the
[10:52] Lord and we're believing for him our
[10:54] brother Vernon winters the last report I
[10:57] got he was in the hospital and
[10:59] I was talking about doing further
[11:01] surgery so the Lord knows every
[11:03] situation he knows how to reach you
[11:05] where you are
[11:06] he's knows how to speak to your heart
[11:09] and generate that faith in your heart to
[11:12] believe God and I'm just pray that it'll
[11:14] be tonight there's something to happen
[11:16] on your behalf and then wherever you are
[11:19] wherever you're gathered we're gathered
[11:22] in his name and when we gather there in
[11:25] his name he comes in our midst and when
[11:28] he comes something good always happens
[11:31] let's talk to the Lord right now father
[11:36] thou knowest ever need you know the
[11:40] situation's Lord many dire needs and
[11:44] terrible situations that people are in
[11:48] Lord there are those that are threatened
[11:51] with prison there are those that are in
[11:54] prison and there are those that lord it
[11:58] because of sickness there's some kind of
[12:01] chain upon them a prison that they are
[12:04] in but we believe that you come to set
[12:07] the prisoners free Lord to open up those
[12:12] who have been in bondage Oh God to set
[12:16] them free to serve the Living God to
[12:18] open up the eyes of the blind though you
[12:20] spear the Lord is upon us and he is
[12:23] anointed us to do this and we believe
[12:26] that you'll break every chain of
[12:28] darkness and unbelief tonight
[12:30] you know the hearts of your people Lord
[12:33] you know the situations that are in
[12:35] maybe a mom dad crying out for a loved
[12:39] one a child someone that's in the
[12:42] bondage of sin Lord will you just bring
[12:45] deliverance father made this be a night
[12:48] of deliverance worth it's a season where
[12:51] the angel of God comes in a season and
[12:55] here he comes and moves and brings
[12:57] deliveries
[12:58] and may this be the season of a revival
[13:01] a season of a renewal of the Holy Spirit
[13:05] in people's lives and hearts and Lord
[13:08] while this renewal is going forth in the
[13:10] angel is moving make chains drop off
[13:13] those that are imprisoned over in China
[13:16] that it would be set free and those that
[13:19] are faced and imprisonment from from

[13:24] deported may you just blind eyes of the
[13:27] officials Lord word that can be set free

[28:51] sicknesses there reach down and touch
[28:53] them I pray father we commit them into
[28:56] your hands for your glory and for your
[28:58] honor in Jesus name Amen let's turn to
[29:03] Joel chapter 2 and verse 25 says and I
[29:14] will restore to you the years that the
[29:17] locusts had eaten the cankerworm the
[29:20] caterpillar and the Palma worm my great
[29:22] army which I sent among you and ye shall
[29:25] eat him plenty and be satisfied and
[29:28] praise the name of the Lord your God
[29:30] that has dealt wondrously with you and
[29:34] my people shall never be ashamed and you
[29:38] shall know that I'm in the midst of
[29:40] Israel and not it that I am the Lord
[29:42] your God and none else and my people
[29:46] shall never be ashamed and it shall come
[29:49] to pass afterward that I will pour out
[29:51] my spirit upon all flesh and your sons
[29:54] and your daughters shall prophesy and
[29:56] your old men shall dream dreams and your
[29:59] young men shall see visions and also
[30:02] upon the servants and upon the
[30:03] hands made in those days well I pour out
[30:06] my spirit and I'll show wonders in the
[30:09] heaven and the earth blood and fire and
[30:11] pillars of smoke and the Sun shall be
[30:14] turned into darkness and the moon into
[30:16] blood before the great and terrible day
[30:19] of the Lord come and it shall come to
[30:21] pass that whosoever shall call on the
[30:24] name of the Lord shall be delivered for
[30:28] in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be
[30:30] deliverance as the Lord has said and in
[30:34] the remnant whom the Lord shall call
[30:37] amen we'll let you be seated this
[30:39] evening I'd like to speak to you out of
[30:43] these couple of verses where's in
[30:46] back-to-back verses I believe it
[30:49] mentions this and my people shall never
[30:52] be ashamed people shall never be ashamed
[30:56] this word a shame means to be put to
[30:59] shame or to be concerted disconcerted
[31:03] which is unsettled or to be disappointed
[31:06] in other words with him you'll never
[31:08] leave disappointed but God had come and
[31:11] meets you and whatever needs you have
[31:14] need of and also and Paul would speak
[31:17] about this you would say as it is
[31:18] written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling
[31:22] stone or rock of offense and whosoever
[31:24] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[31:28] this is the same word shall not be
[31:30] disappointed or be disconcerted or
[31:33] unsettled now it does not mean you won't
[31:35] have unsettling times but in those
[31:38] uncertain times you can be certainly
[31:40] ma'am and in Jesus would even use this
[31:42] when he would say in John chapter 3 and
[31:45] verse 18 he said he that believeth on
[31:48] him is not condemned as condemned is
[31:51] speaking of coming into judgment but
[31:54] also to come into judgment to be
[31:56] unsettled it's along the same word to be
[31:59] put to shame or to be disappointed you
[32:02] know there's gonna be many that will
[32:04] come into judgment I'm glad I'm not one
[32:06] of those or not pointed appointed to
[32:08] that place but they will come to that
[32:10] moment and though they may feel like
[32:12] they got it all handled they may feel
[32:14] like they got it all figured out they
[32:16] realize they've become
[32:17] that moment very ashamed or disconcerted
[32:21] or unsettling no doubt in that in the
[32:23] time of judgment but he said he because
[32:25] he said he that believeth not is
[32:26] condemned already this word condemned is
[32:29] what the word I'm speaking about an
[32:31] unsettled or be ashamed because he has
[32:34] not believed in the name of the only
[32:36] begotten son of God and this is the
[32:38] condemnation that the light has come
[32:40] into the world and the men loved
[32:42] darkness rather than light because their
[32:44] deeds were evil for everyone that death
[32:47] evil hated the light neither cometh the
[32:49] light lest his deeds should be reproved
[32:51] but he that does truth he that doeth
[32:54] truth cometh the light that his deeds
[32:56] may be made manifest that they are
[32:59] wrought in God so amen so we're speaking
[33:02] of this as we look into the scripture
[33:04] here in Joel as he's talking about all
[33:07] the things that had happened the enemy
[33:09] had come this great army the cankerworm
[33:11] and the caterpillar and the parma worm
[33:13] and had stripped all the bark off all
[33:16] the leaves off and and left the plant in
[33:18] a very shameful condition or is very
[33:20] shameful place and brother brandon would
[33:23] speak about this and equate it or bring
[33:25] it as call according to what the church
[33:27] had become how the enemy had come down
[33:29] through the dark ages and stripped off
[33:31] the power of God but the Holy Spirit was
[33:33] once again in this hour released to the
[33:35] church again to bring it back to what it
[33:38] was at the beginning amen and so all
[33:41] that had been taken off or all that had
[33:43] been lost or all that had been stripped
[33:45] away was brought back amen the shame
[33:47] that had been brought was now taken away
[33:50] the reproach was taken away and she was
[33:52] placed back in her rightful position or
[33:54] a rightful place amen and you know I
[33:57] believe that there's a people here upon
[33:59] this earth that that don't have to be
[34:01] ashamed of the God that they serve or
[34:03] don't have to be ashamed of the worship
[34:05] to the worship that they give to the God
[34:07] that they serve you know the lamb you
[34:09] know the world that we live in there
[34:11] definitely don't seem to have any shame
[34:13] on them when they serve the gods of of
[34:15] different men's ideas or man's own
[34:18] doings and they give their bodies that
[34:21] give their soul they give their mind
[34:22] they give their money and there seems to
[34:25] be no shame to that you know they they
[34:26] do everything they can the worship that
[34:28] God and I believe this is a piece
[34:31] but we can come to the house of God or
[34:32] wherever at tonight and we don't have to
[34:34] have any shame and how we worship or who
[34:37] we are how what God has called us to be
[34:40] in this hour amen
[34:41] and we don't have to be unsettled than
[34:43] that God has called a people to worship
[34:46] Him in spirit and in truth amen
[34:48] and I believe all those things have been
[34:50] restored to the church again I believe
[34:52] prayer has been restored
[34:54] I believe they men worship has been
[34:56] restored I believe all these things has
[34:58] been lost down through the ages it's
[35:00] back in the body again and we don't have
[35:03] to be ashamed of what God does among us
[35:05] or how God operates among us or how God
[35:08] sees fit to operate among us amen amen
[35:10] we're going to worship Him in spirit and
[35:13] in truth
[35:14] amen so you know when you come to him
[35:16] you know brother Branham would talk
[35:17] about how about this disappointment you
[35:19] know sometimes you face disappointments
[35:22] in your life and we all have
[35:23] disappointments we we have times of
[35:26] disappointments times of uncertainties
[35:28] and brother Brandon would speak about a
[35:30] man who would come a man into a prayer
[35:32] line and he said one limb was about two
[35:35] inches or three inches shorter than the
[35:37] other one and he wore a high shoe one of
[35:39] those big built-up shoes and he said but
[35:41] he brought him a new pair of shoes and
[35:44] he brought it to the meetin so he could
[35:46] wear that new pair home and he says God
[35:50] will never disappoint anybody with that
[35:53] kind of faith and I believe we can be
[35:56] that kind of people that have that kind
[35:58] of faith to believe that God's going to
[36:00] do what he said he would do and I don't
[36:02] have to be ashamed about Amen it may be
[36:04] a month it may be two months maybe two
[36:06] years ten years but God's gonna do what
[36:09] he said he was going to do and I don't
[36:11] have to be ashamed about it it's not my
[36:13] reproach it's not my word I don't have
[36:15] to worry about it
[36:16] God spoke it God to bring it to pass now
[36:19] we may face times of disappointments and
[36:21] no doubt you know there's been a lot of
[36:23] memes and things about year 2020 and you
[36:26] had a lot of plans and little things and
[36:28] things seemingly it turned upside-down
[36:29] and times of uncertainty but we are to
[36:33] be certain in uncertain times or in
[36:36] times of uncertainty and and
[36:38] recounting some of the sermons that
[36:40] we've heard we are to have an
[36:42] expectation of no matter what the
[36:45] situation William that should not change
[36:47] our expectation of God it was a good
[36:51] year or bad year it does not change our
[36:53] expectation of God and His Word Amen of
[36:57] times around us and things around us are
[36:59] good or they're bad that should not
[37:00] change our expectation amen and God is
[37:04] going to fulfill what he said it would
[37:06] do God is going to have a bride without
[37:08] spot without wrinkle God's going to have
[37:10] a person or a people Amen in full bloom
[37:13] in full authority and for a men to use
[37:16] the Word of God turn and her disposal as
[37:18] we heard Sunday God's going to have that
[37:21] kind of people upon this earth and I
[37:23] don't have to be ashamed about it
[37:25] amen so and we're also to hold the line
[37:28] amen when things are coming and things
[37:30] are pushing us and and we're being
[37:32] pushed similar whatever just hold the
[37:34] line
[37:34] faith has a resting place and this
[37:38] resting place is not dependent upon
[37:40] governments this resting place is not
[37:42] dependent upon the government is good to
[37:44] you or bad to you if the month is good
[37:46] to you're bad to you this is not the
[37:48] resting place

[39:31] more and we let our faith anchor in its
[39:34] eternal resting place and you won't be
[39:37] ashamed it don't mean you want me to

[39:46] ashamed God's still gonna fulfill his
[39:48] word I'm still gonna bring things to
[39:50] pass you know the Sarah Phoenician woman
[39:53] you know had come to Jesus and she was
[39:55] trying to get to him and you know she
[39:57] had a lot of things she had to get
[39:59] through you know and brother bana would
[40:01] say he said faith find sources that
[40:03] others don't see when she heard she
[40:06] believed she might have heard of a
[40:08] neighbor's girl being healed of epilepsy
[40:10] ur which a child had or they might have
[40:13] heard of an epileptic being healed
[40:15] somewhere
[40:15] our daughter too had need of healing but
[40:17] she just heard Jesus could do it see her
[40:24] Jesus could do it so she wanted to give
[40:26] him a chance to do it hey man so amen
[40:30] our faith has got to stay there to give
[40:32] him a chance
[40:33] I mean her faith has got to hold the
[40:35] line to give him a chance
[40:36] amen so he said you know he said he for
[40:40] he was God's Word made flesh in the
[40:42] beginning was the word and the word was
[40:43] god and the word was with god and the
[40:45] word was god and the word was made flesh
[40:47] and dwelt among us the same yesterday
[40:49] today and forever he was there to reveal
[40:52] the promises of God for his
[40:54] and he is here tonight to vindicate and
[40:58] reveal the promises of God made for this
[41:01] age he is here to do it he was in the
[41:05] days of the prophets he was with Moses
[41:07] he was with David he was with Elijah he
[41:09] was with the rest of them the reveal
[41:11] God's promise of that age what God had
[41:13] promised he brought to pass and in this
[41:16] day he's here to do the same but he's
[41:19] just looking for somebody that can
[41:21] that's heard he can do it
[41:24] hallelujah and she believed this no
[41:26] matter how much people didn't believe it
[41:28] she believed it anyway because faith
[41:30] finds a source that other people know
[41:33] nothing about I don't know you when a
[41:35] man has got faith in God he's got a hold
[41:38] of something that he can't explain it's
[41:41] something he's got ahold of he can't
[41:42] push it shove it pull it it just takes
[41:45] him right to where God is
[41:46] that's the way faith is when a man's
[41:48] really got faith in God it finds a
[41:51] source that others can't see his word as
[41:55] a sword is word is sharper and it goes
[41:57] right down into the thoughts and intents
[41:59] of the heart a man who saw her she came
[42:03] right there right there to Jesus she had
[42:07] many hindrances but her faith in have
[42:10] any see faith don't Hatton had knows no
[42:13] hindrance faith knows no hindrance
[42:17] she had her faith she had hindrances but
[42:21] her faith didn't have any hallelujah she
[42:25] had disappointments but her faith didn't
[42:28] have disappointments she has reasons to
[42:31] doubt but her faith held on there was
[42:35] plenty of reasons to give up Lord oh she
[42:37] got to him and no how would he told her
[42:39] I didn't come to you
[42:41] amen listen this is and we you may have
[42:44] hindrances but if you've got faith it
[42:47] knows no defeat it's positive no matter
[42:51] how negative it gets come on somebody
[42:55] it's positive no how about how negative
[42:58] gifts just look at some of our hinders
[43:00] just for a moment some of them might

[43:12] denomination it was she was a human
[43:15] being being been that had been created

[43:25] human being created by God and God said

[43:34] this one took from in that took God said
[43:37] he would whether a denomination was
[43:41] cooperating and not made her no
[43:43] difference she didn't she wasn't worried
[43:45] about that she might have come to
[43:47] another critic might have made her down
[43:49] the line and said well don't you know
[43:50] days of miracles are past we don't have
[43:53] miracles no more that could have been a
[43:55] Jew after she got in there's this
[43:56] country Jesus was in you know saying
[43:59] days of miracles are past there's no
[44:01] such a thing but she just kept moving on
[44:03] her faith just kept pushing her own amen
[44:06] just going right on beyond the
[44:08] disappointments right on beyond all of
[44:11] that right on beyond that she didn't
[44:13] have to be ashamed hallelujah he said if
[44:17] you can only hold that in your heart
[44:19] that God is here to give you the desires
[44:22] of your heart and when you meet his
[44:24] conditions nothing can stand against
[44:27] that hallelujah there might have been a

[47:04] then said Jesus to her
[47:06] I'm not even sent to your race the very
[47:10] one she came believing in turned her
[47:13] down he said now that's a lesson right
[47:16] there she went through all these gates
[47:19] of sorrows and disappointments and and
[47:23] problems and this one but something
[47:25] pulsating inside of her telling her to
[47:28] go and we
[47:29] she got there he turned her down and
[47:32] besides that he said her race was
[47:34] nothing but a bunch of dogs mercy it's
[47:40] not meat for me to take what's the
[47:42] children's bread and feed it to the dogs
[47:44] he said what if he'd had called you that
[47:47] a dog he said I don't know what what
[47:52] would happen if he'd call the
[47:54] pentecostal the dog or if you'd have
[47:55] said Methodist dogs or Baptist dogs my
[47:58] opinion he says went back and told the
[48:00] pastor he was right after all there
[48:02] wasn't nothing to this fella you know
[48:04] that's what they would say if you got a
[48:06] hold something but if he but if you got
[48:07] a hold something's gonna hold you no
[48:10] matter what certain and uncertain times
[48:19] I'm not sent to you race of dogs not me

[48:28] your company you know I'm not sent to
[48:31] you it isn't meat for me my time for you
[48:34] is not now it isn't my time for you why
[48:39] should I waste my time on you good Lance
[48:44] what a disappointment what a timesheet
[48:49] it's okay I got here I went through all
[48:51] that and he says he what he came he
[48:53] won't do it what a disappointment I
[48:56] would have been to the woman that didn't
[48:59] have faith hello did you gets that what
[49:06] a disappointment it would have been to a
[49:08] woman that didn't have faith that wasn't
[49:14] determined he said oh if the church
[49:17] could only see that that no matter what
[49:20] faith is still there no matter if it
[49:24] looks like he's turned around faith is
[49:27] still there no matter if it looks like
[49:29] it's not gonna happen in my generation
[49:31] it's not going to happen
[49:32] faith is still there no matter if it
[49:35] looks like I'm just going to go down
[49:36] into a gray faith is still there
[49:39] no matter if it looks like the case is
[49:42] hopeless and it's impossible and it's
[49:44] impossible to happen the doctor says it
[49:46] ain't gonna happen this one says that
[49:48] ain't gonna happen this one says and
[49:49] it's impossible faith is still there
[49:55] what was the difference he said brother
[49:58] Brennan said she wasn't a hothouse plant
[50:00] it had to be babied and sprayed and keep
[50:03] the bugs off a good healthy plant you
[50:06] don't have to spray at a good healthy
[50:07] plant the bug can't get to its full of
[50:09] health and he said a good born-again
[50:12] faith in God a real genuine Holy Ghost
[50:15] faith nothing is going to turn it down I
[50:20] mean he's got some good Holy Ghost faith
[50:23] nothing is going to turn it down a man
[50:27] is going to go anyhow she wasn't a
[50:30] hybrid you know hybrids they they breed
[50:32] this one is this one it and they get
[50:34] weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker
[50:35] and weaker might get a better looking
[50:37] grain might look all prettier but it's
[50:39] and they can't reproduce nothing it's
[50:41] just dead as midnight that's what I hope
[50:45] she was she was a real seed and he goes
[50:50] on he says see so does a Jinyu I'm born
[50:54] to Kris born-again Christian know where
[50:57] he's from
[50:57] he knows his origin wasn't John Wesley
[51:01] or Luther or that or anybody else it
[51:05] began on the day of Pentecost when God
[51:08] Himself came to his people that's the
[51:12] faith he's looking for that faith when
[51:16] God Himself came into his people a man
[51:19] he made his work manifest and it hears
[51:22] the word and it'll say a man the woman
[51:25] wasn't a hybrid plant she got a hold of
[51:27] something you didn't have to baby her
[51:29] you have to spray her and say now
[51:31] darling please let me beg you to do
[51:32] right let me beg you to do everything
[51:35] tried to hinder I but a real Christian
[51:38] fights for his position fights he has to
[51:43] stand alone sometimes seemingly him and
[51:46] himself and then him and God but he'll
[51:48] fight every
[51:49] so you don't have to baby him
[51:51] around he just holds their winds of hell
[51:56] or blowing and he's staying there see my
[52:00] God has turned around and he's staying
[52:02] there seem like it's impossible but he's
[52:05] staying there
[52:06] this is why I said blessed is he that
[52:08] knocks and keeps on knocking six and
[52:11] keeps on seeking askins keeps on asking
[52:14] he doesn't matter if you've been turned
[52:16] down a hundred time ask again if he
[52:20] knocked a hundred times knock a hundred
[52:22] one time and say God I'm here and your
[52:25] word says this your word says I'm healed
[52:29] and therefore I'm waiting on you to move
[52:31] on my behalf
[52:36] and you won't be ashamed faith always
[52:43] amidst the word is right this is what
[52:47] she did what did she do when he said I
[52:50] wasn't even sent to your race to the
[52:52] dogs
[52:53] what did she do she admitted he was
[52:56] right
[52:57] she said yes Lord faith always missed
[53:01] the word is right he says if your faith
[53:06] don't punctuate every word of God with
[53:08] an a man there's something wrong with
[53:09] your experience the Bible said he's the
[53:11] same yesterday today and forever
[53:13] if you don't say amen to that then
[53:14] something is wrong the work but Jesus
[53:16] said the works that I do show you do say
[53:17] tell you do also me don't say a man to
[53:19] that sand something's wrong if it don't
[53:21] punctuate every word every promise
[53:24] within a man there's something wrong she
[53:26] admitted she was right he was right she
[53:29] admitted she wasn't nothing but a dog
[53:31] she admitted that she was there but even
[53:35] you're right Lord but even the dogs get
[53:40] the crumbs and if all I can get a crumb
[53:44] tonight I'm gonna get a crime hallelujah
[53:47] cuz I know what a crumb will do just a
[53:50] little movement just a little movement
[53:52] of fears will rewrite everything he said
[53:55] what he said mind what would happen what
[53:57] a difference she was put back shut back
[54:01] now put aside put outside she just kept
[54:04] on going something on the insider told
[54:06] her she was gonna get it regardless of
[54:09] how long she had to wait she was after
[54:15] the crumbs yes the dogs eat the crumbs
[54:19] on the master's table that's the way to
[54:21] do it
[54:22] we're not we don't have to take a high
[54:24] seat take the backseat just get a seat
[54:26] and let God move that's the way it is he
[54:29] that humbles himself shall be exalted
[54:32] shall be exalted you won't be ashamed
[54:35] but if you exalt yourself you'll be a
[54:37] base that's a shame
[54:39] and the way up is down hey man she's
[54:41] never seen a miracle she was a Gentile
[54:43] but she had faith she had something
[54:45] along the lines of what Ray I've had had
[54:48] faith Rahab didn't say well wait I see
[54:51] how Joshua combs his hair how the
[54:53] generals look or what the swords look
[54:55] like or what kind of thing but she said
[54:57] I've heard that your God is with you and
[54:59] I've heard of what he even can do and
[55:01] that's good enough for me I want mercy
[55:04] and she being called it out for a man
[55:08] this is what God had done for her you
[55:10] may be a dog but I want to crumb I want
[55:15] what you have for me whatever you see
[55:17] whatever you call me Lord yes your word
[55:21] is true but I want it
[55:26] faith omits the word is right you know
[55:32] we had a little family Martha and Mary
[55:35] who ashamed they've become friends with
[55:38] Jesus close the brothers Lazarus get
[55:42] sick and they'd called for him and
[55:44] people were watching and looking and
[55:46] seeing well surely here come you know to
[55:48] be be he's friends he'll be here to help
[55:51] he's helped this when he's helped that
[55:52] when he's helped the beggar over here
[55:54] surely come help his friends and next
[55:56] thing you know Lazarus dies and one day
[55:58] next day in June it seemed like more and
[56:00] more shame is being hooked heaped upon
[56:02] the family and it seemed like impossible
[56:04] and getting more and more impossible
[56:06] Lazarus now deteriorating in the gray
[56:08] noses dropped in flesh just fell off his
[56:11] bones dead
[56:15] and here comes Jesus walking up what
[56:21] happened when he came corruption knew
[56:25] his master the sole newest creator four
[56:29] days journey somewhere
[56:31] didn't matter there was a voice that
[56:33] could speak and bring him right back
[56:35] again he was a man a man sure Jesus
[56:39] being a man came off the mountain hungry
[56:42] can't come down looking for a tree
[56:44] cutting something off of fruit of a tree
[56:45] it wasn't there he cursed that he was a
[56:47] man when he's hungry but he took five
[56:49] biscuits and two fish and fed 5,000 he
[56:52] was a man when he laden the ship on the
[56:54] back of their sick tired from preaching
[56:56] all day long healing the sick Burt you
[56:58] out of it but he was more than a man
[57:00] when those Devils tried to drown him and
[57:03] he stepped up on the BAS savelic bow
[57:05] that boat it said peace be still and the
[57:07] winds and the waves went down - wasn't
[57:09] even a ripple he was a more than a man
[57:13] and here he come walking up to Martha
[57:16] Martha feeling the shame of the eyes
[57:18] upon her and feeling all the things
[57:20] around in the mocking and making fun oh
[57:23] sure God's really for you sure God
[57:25] really is he Jesus is really your friend
[57:27] look what he did he's left to your
[57:29] brothers in the gray remember me if you
[57:31] believe and you hold on he said and
[57:34] those that believe in him will not be
[57:37] ashamed and here he come walking to the
[57:40] grave and Martha said yes Lord I believe
[57:43] you are the resurrection of life but
[57:46] even now even now in the middle it seems
[57:49] to Fargo but even now what was it faith
[57:55] had found an anchor in place somewhere
[57:58] and it wasn't dependent upon a good day
[58:00] or bad air four days five days ten days
[58:03] one week whatever he wasn't dependent
[58:05] upon that he was dependent upon who was
[58:07] standing in front of her and here she is
[58:13] even now she found something to hold on
[58:16] to in the middle of her storm the
[58:22] shunammite warm in the same way shame
[58:28] right in the middle of it this baby that
[58:30] the Lord had spoke for her dies don't
[58:34] you know the mouth and the things that
[58:36] went on around her and the mocking and
[58:38] the making fun shame
[58:43] but he says whosoever believeth in me
[58:46] shall not be ashamed as we said Martha
[58:51] shamed her shame tried to come
[58:54] disappointment I just thought he would
