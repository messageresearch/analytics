[14:45] instance
[14:47] it went in to fight to try to find the
[14:49] cancer couldn't find a bit of it
[14:51] because god had done a work then we

[44:16] here alive today 2020 he's alive
[44:20] glory 2 000 years ago it was a little
[44:24] manger
[44:25] it was just a little baby simeon held
[44:28] him as a little baby like brother
[44:30] tim held brother enoch this morning but

[44:57] let's just forget around
[44:58] everyone else and all the shepherds and
[45:01] all the
[45:02] wise men all the noise and invite him
[45:06] lord we just want to open our our hearts
[45:09] to you today
[45:11] this message has gone around the world
[45:14] and it's not a little infant
[45:16] message lord a prophet speaking to
[45:19] denominational people
[45:20] but you're speaking now to people that
[45:22] have been living
[45:24] under this presence the rising of the
[45:26] sun
[45:27] this maturing word for many many years
[45:30] and today

[45:33] praises
[45:35] for your blessed presence and your
[45:37] nearness that we sense in this building
[45:40] the angel of the lord that was present
[45:43] in every meeting the pillar of fire that
[45:45] circled the auditoriums
[45:49] brother branham said in one place if you
[45:51] could see the angels that line these
[45:53] walls
[45:54] oh jesus appear to us today lord

[46:14] it's not a picture of you on a cross
[46:17] that will save anyone it's you today
[46:19] in the building making your presence
[46:21] known to an individual
[46:23] that will say save me lord
[46:26] somebody needs filling you're the filler
[46:29] somebody needs deliverance you're
[46:31] passing by this moment
[46:33] if we could touch the hem of that
[46:35] garment bless this congregation
[46:38] bless the atmosphere they create for you
[46:41] and you would feel
[46:42] comfortable and welcome that nervousness
[46:44] and anxieties could leave that we could
[46:47] all be
[46:48] the gifts that you would desire us to be
[46:50] for 2021
[46:52] lord this is our first sunday service so
[46:54] we want to consecrate
[46:56] ourselves dedicate ourselves
[46:59] one year ago if we would have known what
[47:01] was hap going to happen in just a few
[47:04] weeks
[47:05] in 2020 oh jesus would we have been more
[47:09] serious would we have
[47:11] leaned forward in our chairs would we
[47:14] have soaked in every moment that we
[47:16] could have had if we would have only
[47:18] known
[47:19] today we stand in your presence speaking
[47:22] to you
[47:24] you are revealing to us your mind and
[47:26] the season

[47:54] amen god bless you would you just have
[47:57] your seats for just a moment i
[48:00] greet you this is very um
[48:04] surprise that we're here this morning um
[48:08] it wasn't planned just actually a few
[48:11] moments
[48:12] before uh the service i think your
[48:14] service on thursday we were making the
[48:16] final
[48:17] plan so this is all a surprise to us
[48:20] even those in our church that might be
[48:22] streaming you're probably as surprised
[48:24] as
[48:24] as i am so god bless you today
[48:27] and it's nice to see your faces six
[48:29] months ago we were here on a sunday
[48:32] morning and
[48:32] brother tim wasn't here he was at the
[48:35] hospital
[48:36] with the first lady of the church sister
[48:39] karen but i'm so happy that on this
[48:41] sunday
[48:42] she could come to church with you
[48:43] brother tim she could be in the house of
[48:46] god and
[48:47] we give you glory lord give you praises
[48:50] and brother chris smith i don't know if
[48:53] i've met you
[48:54] very much but it was a wonderful
[48:57] baby dedication for your son wasn't it
[48:59] who enjoyed that i
[49:00] i've got to hear brother chris's
[49:02] testimony
[49:08] and when i drove to church today with
[49:10] brother tim and sister karen there was
[49:11] room for a car seat in the back seat so
[49:14] i'm sure
[49:14] but brother tim uh wasn't joking when he
[49:17] said if you ever
[49:20] but when the little girls the sisters
[49:22] thought about brother tim taking him
[49:24] home i don't think they were very
[49:25] excited about that so
[49:28] god bless brother enoch elijah what a
[49:31] name
[49:32] with a name like that you know i feel
[49:34] like just sliding into the back row
[49:36] somewhere and
[49:37] enoch elijah may the lord bless the
[49:40] family and brother chris god bless you
[49:41] maybe
[49:42] i'll hear your testimony on the way to
[49:45] the airport amen but
[49:46] i think a deacon is going to drive me in
[49:48] a few minutes i've got to leave right
[49:50] away
[49:50] to be back home and right back into
[49:53] where we're supposed to be
[49:55] and so god bless you today and i just
[49:57] wanted to greet you from our hearts and
[50:00] when we come here um
[50:02] [Music]
[50:03] we know you usually from seeing you on
[50:06] the screens
[50:07] because we stream your services and we
[50:09] ask the brothers and the sisters about
[50:11] you
[50:12] and your faces and so i don't want you
[50:15] to ever think that you're just someone
[50:16] that sits in the assembly and no one
[50:18] notices
[50:20] uh there's a cloud of many witnesses
[50:23] that
[50:24] and believers that love you our assembly
[50:27] loves you i bring you greetings from
[50:28] many in our assembly that love you
[50:30] dearly
[50:31] and we've been able to share over the
[50:33] years
[50:34] uh sacred moments uh with your assembly
[50:38] and i want to thank you from the bottom
[50:40] of my heart and from our family
[50:43] and to the thousands i was talking to
[50:46] brother tim and sister
[50:47] karen about the thousands of young
[50:49] people
[50:51] that you have influenced from just your
[50:53] easter meetings and it's gone around the
[50:55] world
[50:56] and just throughout the years you've you
[50:58] have
[50:59] went from a little church in the
[51:03] in the forest in the woods to now god
[51:06] has brought his vision
[51:08] more clearer into the front lines
[51:11] and now there are literally many
[51:15] that stream your services or have been
[51:17] affected by your assembly you're not
[51:19] a little church in the woods anymore
[51:22] but you're an assembly do you all know
[51:24] that
[51:25] god has brought your testimonies and the
[51:28] miracles and the healings and the
[51:30] salvation and the
[51:32] impulses of faith that comes through
[51:34] this assembly
[51:35] it's gone global so whether you realize
[51:38] it or not
[51:39] god has called you to be on the front
[51:41] lines and this morning
[51:43] um speaking from our hearts if you see
[51:45] us with some notepads it's because the
[51:47] the message is so fresh as we were
[51:50] coming through
[51:51] christmas season we spoke a couple
[51:54] messages on
[51:55] christmas one in seattle a church and
[51:57] then one in our camp
[51:59] um a place where we worship on the u.s
[52:02] side of the border
[52:03] and there was just a phrase out of luke
[52:05] chapter one
[52:07] that was where we're going to be reading
[52:09] just a phrase
[52:11] brother johnny just a phrase that caught
[52:13] me
[52:14] and i thought maybe there would be
[52:16] another place or a place that i would
[52:18] minister that and i didn't know i would
[52:19] be here standing today
[52:21] i want to speak this morning on 2021
[52:25] blessed is she
[52:28] blessed is she and uh
[52:31] is of course blessed is she is mary out
[52:34] of the scripture but blessed
[52:36] is she blessed is the bride blessed are
[52:39] you
[52:41] it wasn't and we're going to read the
[52:42] scripture i want you to notice it wasn't
[52:44] blessed
[52:46] is just the womb but blessed is the
[52:48] fruit of the womb
[52:50] blessed is the life that's going to come
[52:52] out of this womb
[52:54] so from a teenage young lady in the
[52:56] message
[52:57] came a savior hallelujah
[53:02] blessed is she and we can look back and
[53:05] look back but today i want you to
[53:07] we have all arrived to 2021
[53:12] and if you see me looking in my notes
[53:14] it's because there's been
[53:15] things personal even on the airplane and
[53:17] coming that is very personal for this
[53:20] morning
[53:20] our whole lives have come down to this
[53:23] year
[53:25] all of our lives have come down to this
[53:27] year
[53:28] so blessed is she blessed are you in
[53:31] 2020 god bless you you can
[53:33] stand to your feet if you'd like to turn
[53:35] to the scripture thank you musicians and
[53:38] brother michael into the assembly
[53:42] luke chapter 1 as we have prayed already
[53:48] you're blessed and
[53:52] may the lord open our hearts to that
[53:54] reality today more than uh
[53:56] words on a new year's card or
[53:59] blessed are you or i seen new year's
[54:01] blessings
[54:03] more than a virtual uh something that we
[54:06] would have with our families and
[54:07] everybody would be clapping
[54:08] and smiling and you know sometimes it
[54:11] has to be virtual
[54:13] celebrations have become virtual
[54:15] everyone becomes distancing
[54:16] and they want to cover everything but
[54:19] right in that season
[54:20] of darkness comes a message blessed are
[54:23] you
[54:26] luke chapter 1 verse
[54:30] 26 if you can have some patience to read
[54:33] with me
[54:34] a few words of the scripture in luke
[54:36] chapter 1
[54:37] verse 26 this was after elizabeth had
[54:41] become
[54:41] expecting and in the sixth month the
[54:44] angel gabriel
[54:46] was sent from god into a city of galilee
[54:50] called nazareth
[54:53] to a virgin
[54:56] espoused to a man engaged to a man whose
[54:59] name was joseph
[55:00] of the house of david and the virgin's
[55:02] name was
[55:04] mary and the angel came in unto her
[55:09] watch each verse here the angel gabriel
[55:12] came in unto her and said hail saluted
[55:14] thou
[55:15] that art highly favored the lord is with
[55:18] thee
[55:20] he didn't ask her do you feel blessed do
[55:23] you feel favored his brother
[55:25] aaron has been speaking on highly
[55:26] favored he didn't ask her
[55:28] her opinion do you feel special
[55:31] he said the lord is with thee
[55:37] blessed art thou among women
[55:41] and when she saw him
[55:44] she was just a teenager she was troubled
[55:48] at the same and cast in her mind what
[55:50] manner of salutation
[55:52] this should be and the angel said unto
[55:54] her fear not
[55:56] mary or don't have no fear
[55:59] 2021 fear not mary
[56:03] for thou hast found favor with god and
[56:05] behold
[56:07] thou shalt conceive in thy womb and
[56:09] bring forth a son and shall call his
[56:12] name
[56:12] jesus can we all say that name together
[56:16] he shall be great and shall be called
[56:19] the son of the highest
[56:21] and the lord god shall give unto him the
[56:23] throne of his father david
[56:25] and he shall reign over the house of
[56:28] jacob forever
[56:29] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[56:33] so that means it's still alive today
[56:36] does this assembly believe that of his
[56:38] kingdom there shall be no end
[56:41] hallelujah and then said mary i want you
[56:45] to look at verse 34
[56:47] then said mary unto the angel how shall
[56:50] this be
[56:51] seen i know not a man i'm a virgin
[56:55] i don't know a man and the angel
[56:56] answered and said unto her the holy
[56:58] ghost
[56:59] shall come upon thee and the power of
[57:02] the highest shall overshadow thee
[57:05] therefore also that holy thing which
[57:08] shall be born of thee
[57:09] shall be called the son of god and
[57:12] behold
[57:13] my cousin elizabeth
[57:17] oh what a wonderful sister elizabeth
[57:21] an elder in the message a well stricken
[57:24] sister in the church she hath also
[57:27] conceived a son in her old age
[57:30] and this is the sixth month with her who
[57:32] was called barren
[57:34] for with god nothing shall be impossible
[57:38] and mary said behold the hands made of
[57:41] the lord
[57:41] be it unto me according to thy word
[57:44] and the angel departed from her
[57:47] and mary arose in those days and went
[57:49] into the hill country with
[57:51] haste into a city of judah and entered
[57:54] into the house of zacharias
[57:56] and saluted elizabeth and it came to
[57:59] pass that when elizabeth
[58:01] heard the salutation of mary the babe
[58:04] leaped in her womb and elizabeth
[58:08] was filled with the holy ghost wouldn't
[58:10] that be great if that happened today for
[58:12] every believer just
[58:14] as the word was being spoken they were
[58:16] all all
[58:17] all filled with the holy ghost
[58:20] just at the sound of jesus
[58:26] there's so much power not just in those
[58:28] letters or
[58:29] if there's power in his presence
[58:32] blessed is she that would receive this
[58:36] into their womb
[58:38] and when she began to speak about it and
[58:41] talk about it
[58:42] life came power came and elizabeth
[58:45] was filled with the holy ghost and she
[58:47] spake out now watch
[58:49] these next few verses and she spake out
[58:51] with a loud voice and said
[58:53] blessed art thou among women elizabeth
[58:56] is
[58:57] speaking to mary blessed art thou among
[59:00] women
[59:01] and blessed is the fruit of thy womb
[59:05] whence is this to me that the mother of
[59:07] my
[59:08] lord should come to me
[59:12] for lo as soon as the voice of thy
[59:16] salutation sounded in my ears
[59:20] welcome to church today as soon as the
[59:23] word begins to go spoken through your
[59:25] ears something happens
[59:27] inside of a believer as soon as the
[59:31] voice of thy salutation
[59:33] sounded in my ears the babe leaped in my
[59:35] womb for joy
[59:37] and our last verse and this was the
[59:39] verse that stopped me
[59:41] a few weeks ago and bless it
[59:44] is she blessed is she
[59:48] that believed for there shall be a
[59:52] performance
[59:53] of those things which were told her from
[59:56] the lord
[59:57] we read all of these verses for that
[59:59] last verse blessed
[1:00:01] is she that believed and god bless you
[1:00:04] that believe today
[1:00:06] and god bless your 20 21
[1:00:09] to you that believe god bless you you
[1:00:12] can have your seats together
[1:00:22] she was just a teenager
[1:00:28] mary was just a teenager
[1:00:35] and we see the morning sun coming up
[1:00:38] over the horizon
[1:00:40] and mary is walking down the road
[1:00:44] just a teenager as i was kneeling
[1:00:48] in our chair this morning in this room
[1:00:51] where i was and had opened the shades
[1:00:52] and the window was coming across the
[1:00:54] frosted grass
[1:00:56] and i i was just kneeling looking at
[1:00:58] these words of brother branham
[1:01:00] and the morning sun here is mary
[1:01:05] just a young lady
[1:01:08] her mother had passed away we're told
[1:01:12] and she was being raised by her father
[1:01:15] so life hadn't always been easy for mary
[1:01:20] sometimes brother branham would say she
[1:01:22] was 15 years old and
[1:01:24] other places maybe 16 and another place
[1:01:28] 18 but as mary is coming and the
[1:01:31] sun is rising she's making her way down
[1:01:34] a pathway
[1:01:36] she was thinking about what had happened
[1:01:38] the day before
[1:01:40] after coming from church see mary was a
[1:01:44] believer
[1:01:46] she was a teenager in the message
[1:01:50] but she was a virgin that was looking to
[1:01:52] the word
[1:01:53] as she was pondering as she was thinking
[1:01:57] about
[1:01:57] the word that had been spoken at the
[1:02:00] synagogue
[1:02:01] and we would say church today she was
[1:02:03] thinking about the day before
[1:02:06] and as the priest had took the scroll of
[1:02:09] isaiah
[1:02:11] was it isaiah chapter 7 verse 14
[1:02:15] that he took a virgin shall conceive
[1:02:20] and in that service brother branham said
[1:02:22] the priest
[1:02:23] read the scripture and then there wasn't
[1:02:25] a lot of faith
[1:02:26] being mixed with the word that day she
[1:02:29] still had a question
[1:02:30] how's a virgin gonna conceive this has
[1:02:33] never
[1:02:34] happened before this has never happened
[1:02:36] that a virgin would
[1:02:37] bring forth a child that's impossible
[1:02:41] that a virgin shall conceive
[1:02:45] how is this gonna be and so now it's the
[1:02:48] day after and
[1:02:49] mary is with her engaged husband his
[1:02:52] name was joseph
[1:02:54] and joseph was a carpenter
[1:02:57] and they were engaged to be married so
[1:02:59] they were planning
[1:03:00] they were actually building their house
[1:03:04] if you read brother branham's message
[1:03:05] you would brother branham said
[1:03:07] they were already building on their new
[1:03:08] home so they were already planning ahead
[1:03:11] for the future and they
[1:03:13] came together on the day after the
[1:03:15] service and they were
[1:03:16] talking about isaiah and talking about
[1:03:18] what had been spoken in the service
[1:03:20] about he said the morning service and
[1:03:23] they were reading out of the book of
[1:03:25] isaiah and mary asked the question
[1:03:27] because they were having devotion
[1:03:30] that's what brother branham said so
[1:03:32] these were two believers they were
[1:03:34] interested
[1:03:35] about the season they were living in not
[1:03:37] just about isaiah's day
[1:03:39] but about their day welcome to 2021
[1:03:45] it's not just looking back and
[1:03:46] describing the manger and
[1:03:49] describing shepherds and then talking
[1:03:51] about wise men that traveled two years
[1:03:54] and came to a little boy in a house that
[1:03:57] was maybe
[1:03:58] pulling at the at their uh you know
[1:04:00] looking at their sandals and
[1:04:02] he was maybe more excited about their
[1:04:04] camels than anything he's just
[1:04:06] a two-year-old boy that maybe got
[1:04:08] disinterested after a while because
[1:04:11] these men are giving gold frankincense
[1:04:15] and myrrh but he didn't understand he's
[1:04:17] just like any other
[1:04:18] two-year-old a child of evening like
[1:04:21] tabernacle
[1:04:23] we can look back and make dramas and
[1:04:25] have big plays
[1:04:26] and see it on a screen and we can talk
[1:04:29] about
[1:04:30] it and fantasize about what happened but
[1:04:33] friends we are living in reality today
[1:04:36] let's all wake up that it's 20 21.
[1:04:40] one year ago there was not be any of us
[1:04:45] that would have known what was going to
[1:04:46] happen in 2020
[1:04:49] it just seemed like the world was going
[1:04:51] on and money was being made and families
[1:04:53] were
[1:04:54] being raised and things were churches
[1:04:56] were gathering
[1:04:57] and you were going to work and the
[1:04:58] hospitals were you'd say
[1:05:00] just normally feel but now something
[1:05:02] happened
[1:05:03] and and it causes a change it causes a
[1:05:06] global shift
[1:05:09] so today we're being forced to not just
[1:05:11] look back and
[1:05:12] then try to understand why and all of
[1:05:15] that but here we are this morning
[1:05:17] our whole life has come down to this
[1:05:20] year right now
[1:05:23] and i pray a blessing for you
[1:05:27] evening like tabernacle that eternity
[1:05:30] would ring through time this year
[1:05:35] that if you have been in a fog or been
[1:05:37] in kind of just going along
[1:05:39] that the lord jesus would make this
[1:05:41] season
[1:05:42] and his presence to you so real
[1:05:46] that while we are hearing the messages
[1:05:49] well
[1:05:50] you have the privilege of hearing the
[1:05:54] word like you do
[1:05:56] that we grab ahold of that and say god
[1:05:58] let this season
[1:06:00] of our lives be more real can we all
[1:06:04] agree like that i mean
[1:06:05] the the reason that brother john is here
[1:06:07] is because our
[1:06:08] side of the border cannot have a service
[1:06:11] today normally
[1:06:12] there might be a service tonight or we'd
[1:06:14] be able to gather we haven't been able
[1:06:16] to gather like that and it's not normal
[1:06:18] definitely not in canada
[1:06:20] at cloverdale bible way our church
[1:06:23] they're just down to the technicians and
[1:06:25] the
[1:06:26] speaker and it's down to just having the
[1:06:28] essential ones for the meeting and
[1:06:30] people are calling the police and you
[1:06:32] know there's cars in the parking lot and
[1:06:34] what's happening this is the climate
[1:06:36] we're living in
[1:06:38] the borders are shut down we cannot go
[1:06:41] to our church we cannot gather with
[1:06:43] other believers we cannot sing and
[1:06:45] raise our hands excuse me if we're a
[1:06:48] little bit kind of rusty this morning
[1:06:50] it's because
[1:06:50] we haven't been able to be in a church
[1:06:53] live service
[1:06:54] every week like you have
[1:06:58] i think we said that six months ago
[1:06:59] didn't we hadn't been in a service for a
[1:07:02] long time well with six months later and
[1:07:04] and there's times that we gather and
[1:07:05] times that we meet but in our certain
[1:07:07] state you know the governor
[1:07:09] and it's just like jesus's day when
[1:07:11] augusta wanted to attacks and it was a
[1:07:13] not an easy time it was not an opportune
[1:07:16] time
[1:07:17] to be a believer
[1:07:20] the government is saying you've got to
[1:07:22] go back to your town you've got to go
[1:07:23] back to
[1:07:24] city to be taxed and do you remember
[1:07:26] mary and joseph were from bethlehem
[1:07:30] but if you just are spiritual you'll
[1:07:32] find in the scripture
[1:07:33] so that it might be fulfilled what the
[1:07:36] scripture had said
[1:07:37] they didn't even realize when they
[1:07:39] stopped at the mountain just turning the
[1:07:42] the corner coming out of the mountain
[1:07:44] coming overlooking bethlehem and
[1:07:47] you know mary was just pregnant now with
[1:07:49] these months and
[1:07:51] and it's told that joseph just took her
[1:07:53] off the donkey for just a little rest
[1:07:57] she's a teenager just a little rest and
[1:08:01] is it possible that there would be room
[1:08:04] tonight that i'm just feeling such a
[1:08:06] heaviness such a burden
[1:08:10] it was a season they were in and and
[1:08:13] they could have been talking about
[1:08:15] politics they could have been speaking
[1:08:18] about the ruler and he was so
[1:08:20] mean and nasty to have us all go on the
[1:08:23] back of a camel
[1:08:24] and like you know there could have been
[1:08:25] excuses that you know there could have
[1:08:27] been
[1:08:28] billboards of you know the bethlehem
[1:08:30] eaglets are having a
[1:08:31] basketball game and they're going
[1:08:33] against the nazareth pinto
[1:08:35] lights or whatever and and you know all
[1:08:38] the
[1:08:38] designs and the things they could have
[1:08:40] been attracted to you know
[1:08:41] the camel races or whatever but their
[1:08:44] minds was not on
[1:08:46] the camel races it wasn't on lsu
[1:08:50] versus arkansas or it wasn't on the
[1:08:52] local governor
[1:08:53] what's happening in louisiana what's
[1:08:55] happening in california who's going to
[1:08:57] be president in a few days like
[1:09:00] they didn't talk about that it wasn't
[1:09:01] the main thing
[1:09:04] you say how do you know that it's
[1:09:05] because they were young people that had
[1:09:08] been
[1:09:08] birthed in their season they they were
[1:09:11] totally captivated with
[1:09:13] i'm trying to understand what would be
[1:09:15] the mind of the lord
[1:09:19] and you know the story there was no room
[1:09:21] in the end
[1:09:23] jesus was born in a manger
[1:09:27] and why why did it have to be shepherds
[1:09:32] we're going to get into that just in a
[1:09:33] little bit why little bethlehem
[1:09:37] and if you look at brother branham's
[1:09:38] last christmas message
[1:09:41] who do you say that this is 1964. do you
[1:09:44] brother branham went through the
[1:09:45] christmas season that and if you just
[1:09:48] are interested to look back in the month
[1:09:50] of december
[1:09:51] in the message you'll find a lot of wise
[1:09:55] why little bethlehem he preached that
[1:09:58] twice
[1:09:58] why little bethlehem why did it have to
[1:10:01] be
[1:10:02] shepherds this is his last christmas
[1:10:05] message and he was saying i spoke the
[1:10:07] other night
[1:10:08] in tucson why did it have to be
[1:10:10] shepherds and
[1:10:11] a few years ago why was it little
[1:10:14] bethlehem and he said the lord willing
[1:10:16] this is his last christmas message in
[1:10:19] december now he would never see 1965
[1:10:24] christmas but the lord willing next
[1:10:27] christmas i want to preach on
[1:10:29] why did it have to be the wise men
[1:10:32] is that incredible he's already he's
[1:10:35] already projecting out there
[1:10:36] there was already burdens on his heart
[1:10:38] there was already
[1:10:39] inspiration friends we are blessed
[1:10:44] whatever happened yesterday we're
[1:10:46] blessed whatever happens today

[1:11:16] and you know last six months ago we came
[1:11:19] here
[1:11:20] we did not know when we were coming that
[1:11:22] on the very
[1:11:23] hours before we would come sister karen
[1:11:25] would be in the hospital with a brain
[1:11:27] bleed and
[1:11:28] we would be standing here and brother
[1:11:29] tim wouldn't be at the serb we didn't
[1:11:31] know that
[1:11:33] and now we talk about it and say that
[1:11:35] was god just orchestrate
[1:11:37] today i didn't know but just a few hours
[1:11:39] ago we would be here

[1:11:59] with so many of our elders in the

[1:12:04] revelation of this message
[1:12:06] deal with us now in 2021
[1:12:11] can we unite around that we could i'll
[1:12:13] get out of the way long enough and say
[1:12:15] lord

[1:12:22] he was already speaking about the next
[1:12:24] christmas why did it have to be the wise
[1:12:26] men these wise
[1:12:28] these wise wise he said they've got
[1:12:30] answers to them and they're right here
[1:12:32] in the bible
[1:12:34] he said here we find ourselves at
[1:12:36] christmas just about like they did in
[1:12:37] the first christmas
[1:12:39] the world's just about ready to fall
[1:12:41] apart brother joe couldn't have he had
[1:12:43] preached that this morning the world's
[1:12:44] falling apart
[1:12:45] who agrees with that well the world is
[1:12:48] collapsing
[1:12:51] don't get caught up in the collapse when
[1:12:54] they're going down
[1:12:56] we're going up when all the numbers are
[1:12:59] trending down
[1:13:00] and the stress and the nervousness and
[1:13:02] the sin and the morals is going down
[1:13:06] i'm glad that god sent a messenger to
[1:13:09] you
[1:13:09] and i'm here today to announce blessed
[1:13:12] is she
[1:13:14] blessed are you that have a womb
[1:13:19] to receive the word so that when it's
[1:13:22] spoken
[1:13:23] something ignites you and you become
[1:13:26] jesus
[1:13:26] in flesh aren't you happy about that
[1:13:29] mary
[1:13:30] blessed are you well how is this going
[1:13:34] to be and i don't understand
[1:13:36] that was a question how is this going to
[1:13:39] happen i'm just
[1:13:40] i'm a virgin and i don't know a man
[1:13:49] as she's walking down the road
[1:13:53] this was just what was on her heart she
[1:13:55] was pondering these things this is mary
[1:14:00] she's just a teenager
[1:14:03] we would say that under an inspiration
[1:14:05] even hearing it this morning when i
[1:14:07] first woke up and brother bradham said
[1:14:08] she was just a teenager
[1:14:10] and i was thinking about that but the
[1:14:12] world would say she was
[1:14:14] just a teenager looking down
[1:14:18] scoffing how could something so great
[1:14:21] come out of something so young
[1:14:27] brother branham described it like this
[1:14:29] her walking down
[1:14:30] the pathway and all of a sudden the
[1:14:33] light started flickering
[1:14:37] this is a teenager just pondering the
[1:14:40] sunday message and
[1:14:41] being with her engaged husband and
[1:14:44] thinking about their new home
[1:14:47] but it's not like she was all caught up
[1:14:49] in the coloring and
[1:14:51] the interior deck and the lighting and
[1:14:53] it wasn't that she was all caught up in
[1:14:55] that
[1:14:56] it was around her we have jobs we we
[1:14:59] have college we have
[1:15:00] school we all have finances is that true
[1:15:05] but mary was pondering the word
[1:15:10] not that mary was not stressed she was a
[1:15:13] teenager she was going through
[1:15:15] changes of life she was looking forward
[1:15:17] to marriage
[1:15:18] we we all have stress
[1:15:22] 2021 may very well have more stress
[1:15:26] and i'm just being very honest with you
[1:15:29] today in some of my notes i
[1:15:31] i mentioned about uh we
[1:15:34] we want to be personal
[1:15:38] as a minister that's very positive
[1:15:42] birth by a token that's very positive
[1:15:45] and we speak very positive that's even
[1:15:47] our nature
[1:15:48] to be positive but 2021 for the world
[1:15:51] looks very grim
[1:15:54] it looks very negative in fact what's
[1:15:57] going to happen in america is not all
[1:15:59] joy to the world and you might have
[1:16:03] heard that song in december
[1:16:04] in your local malls joy to the world but
[1:16:07] they have no idea
[1:16:08] they have rejected joy it's not in drugs
[1:16:12] it's not an alcohol it's not in sexual
[1:16:15] perversion it's not impartial and we see
[1:16:19] even it's not just churches that are
[1:16:21] being under these lockdowns but
[1:16:23] their whole economies their whole
[1:16:25] pleasure
[1:16:27] churches of stadiums full of of
[1:16:31] cheering roaring crowds
[1:16:36] even on a saturday even
[1:16:39] even today when they are still trying to
[1:16:42] squeeze
[1:16:43] out a little bit of pleasure from their
[1:16:46] nfl gods or
[1:16:47] they're nba gods but if if you look from
[1:16:50] one year ago
[1:16:51] the crowds that were cheering and
[1:16:53] roaring and the tailgate parties and all
[1:16:55] the enthusiasm
[1:16:57] now even the world is being squeezed
[1:16:59] down
[1:17:00] squeezed down is that true
[1:17:03] so don't get it in your mind some
[1:17:05] religious spirits that it's just
[1:17:07] people in the message that are in a
[1:17:09] squeeze
[1:17:12] the world is sensing a change
[1:17:16] we have come to another season
[1:17:22] and to you that are spiritual today
[1:17:25] locally
[1:17:25] and globally
[1:17:30] blessed are you they have received the
[1:17:34] angel
[1:17:35] in your day and the light started
[1:17:39] flickering
[1:17:42] and gabriel the angel
[1:17:46] was following her hallelujah
[1:17:49] brother tim if you want to find what
[1:17:52] brother john is speaking of today it's
[1:17:54] three messages of brother branham
[1:17:56] he spoke on mary's belief 1959 in
[1:18:00] april 1960 in march and 1961
[1:18:04] in january here brother branham is
[1:18:06] coming through the whole year and in all
[1:18:08] three messages
[1:18:09] it's bursting into the first few months
[1:18:11] of the year he's speaking about mary's
[1:18:13] belief
[1:18:16] bless it is she it was like he was
[1:18:19] putting before the people
[1:18:21] this is the capstone god give us more
[1:18:25] memories in our lives
[1:18:30] gabriel the angel standing
[1:18:33] in front of her and brother branham said
[1:18:36] the angel
[1:18:37] was following her lord jesus
[1:18:41] let this be a blessing on each one of
[1:18:43] you today
[1:18:44] and throughout this year that god's
[1:18:46] angels
[1:18:47] would be dispatched to your life
[1:18:50] come on friends that whatever you have
[1:18:53] need of that it's not just you
[1:18:55] running to an angel or running to him
[1:18:57] but it's
[1:18:58] following you god's grace is catching up
[1:19:02] to you
[1:19:03] god's mercy is new every morning
[1:19:08] and that includes 2021.
[1:19:13] and we might be in a sunday morning
[1:19:15] service and
[1:19:16] kind of here now and it's 12 22 and
[1:19:19] we're just kind of
[1:19:20] sensing out the meeting and everything
[1:19:22] but little do you realize
[1:19:25] when we just calm ourselves
[1:19:29] and let our nervous frustration and our
[1:19:31] anxious
[1:19:32] hearts and sometimes our upsettingness
[1:19:34] just begins to
[1:19:36] kind of melt away brother haven
[1:19:40] just kind of melts away and we're in his
[1:19:43] presence
[1:19:47] but then there's just walking down the
[1:19:49] pathway of our life we're back to our
[1:19:52] thoughts and back to our day and back to
[1:19:54] our living
[1:19:56] little did we know
[1:19:59] little did mary know that was the day
[1:20:03] that god was dispatching to her visible
[1:20:06] sight
[1:20:06] an angel that was standing there lights
[1:20:09] flickering
[1:20:12] and we don't need hollywood to dramatize
[1:20:15] it for us
[1:20:16] she was a believer you're a believer
[1:20:18] [Applause]
[1:20:20] god made those angels appear to us
[1:20:23] and may we have a heart that says i
[1:20:25] believe that
[1:20:27] i believe what you're saying
[1:20:31] i don't even need to see it with my eyes
[1:20:34] but there's just
[1:20:35] a confirmation in my heart and there's a
[1:20:38] vindication
[1:20:39] something is real there
[1:20:43] and when you hear that about a brother
[1:20:46] it was
[1:20:47] the brother that was coming into the
[1:20:49] room to put in the microphone the
[1:20:50] batteries
[1:20:51] he's 20 years old brother butts and when
[1:20:54] we just begin to talk a little bit
[1:20:56] together you could already just
[1:21:00] sense that vindication in his life
[1:21:03] i don't need to know drama i don't need
[1:21:05] to talk to him about
[1:21:06] what happened since the last youth camp
[1:21:08] and you couldn't have youth camp last
[1:21:11] you know year and are we going to have
[1:21:13] it this year i don't need to know all
[1:21:14] about his family
[1:21:16] and his grades or the decisions he's
[1:21:19] making in his
[1:21:20] career it's just a few moments
[1:21:25] because people that are spiritual look
[1:21:27] beyond the dress
[1:21:29] look beyond the skirt they look beyond
[1:21:32] the hair
[1:21:33] they look beyond the cancer they look
[1:21:35] beyond the pain
[1:21:36] they look beyond the frustration of 2020
[1:21:39] or whatever happened
[1:21:40] and they say as for me and this house
[1:21:43] we are going to serve the lord
[1:21:45] [Applause]
[1:21:47] and that's not just for the fathers or
[1:21:49] the mothers or the elders it's for
[1:21:51] all of us children and young people
[1:21:56] you are blessed
[1:22:01] the angel was following her
[1:22:04] i trust that 2021 is filled with
[1:22:07] supernatural events
[1:22:09] that the friends that i'm around the
[1:22:11] people that we associate with
[1:22:13] the circle that is texting or emailing
[1:22:16] or calling
[1:22:16] that you make your life around that it
[1:22:19] is people that is godly
[1:22:20] that is cheering you on that is
[1:22:22] encouraging you
[1:22:24] we have found out very quick how shallow
[1:22:27] the world is
[1:22:29] what a degree can do for somebody
[1:22:33] you know what making six figures meant a
[1:22:35] year ago and what it means today to
[1:22:37] someone that has
[1:22:38] now stayed at home and looked at a
[1:22:40] screen for the last 10 months
[1:22:44] and the violence and the domestic
[1:22:46] violence and the alcoholism that has
[1:22:48] spiked over 30 percent
[1:22:50] and the mental things that people are
[1:22:52] going through and the stress on families
[1:22:55] and i'm not talking about worldly people
[1:22:57] only
[1:23:00] i was just with a couple in the message
[1:23:02] that are married and have children from
[1:23:04] europe and i just spent a few hours with
[1:23:06] them
[1:23:06] a few days ago and we were just
[1:23:08] discussing about what this has all
[1:23:10] had an effect on them and on their
[1:23:12] families and you know streaming services
[1:23:15] only or they have little children and
[1:23:16] how do they connect and how how are they
[1:23:18] doing with their
[1:23:20] teenagers in their church and things
[1:23:22] that this is the very
[1:23:24] meetings that brother timothy pruitt was
[1:23:26] at a year ago right now
[1:23:29] and brother danny steeman they were at
[1:23:32] these meetings and
[1:23:33] you know you hear the music and you hear
[1:23:35] the services and there's hundreds
[1:23:37] of young people and it's gone global the
[1:23:39] effects but now
[1:23:41] today it is silent that room is silent
[1:23:48] where they had the prayer lines
[1:23:52] for the gym where they had the he were
[1:23:54] people that desired salvation
[1:23:56] that room is silent where people were
[1:23:59] filled with the holy ghost
[1:24:01] but i can tell you one thing or more
[1:24:03] than one thing but one of the young men
[1:24:05] that gave his heart to the lord in those
[1:24:07] services
[1:24:07] is serving god today his wife was
[1:24:10] baptized this past year
[1:24:12] they're serving god going on with god
[1:24:14] blessed is he
[1:24:18] blessed is that family blessed is that
[1:24:20] church that though they can't even
[1:24:22] gather
[1:24:22] like this in the congregation there are
[1:24:25] still people going on with god
[1:24:27] they are blessed so don't let your
[1:24:29] environment
[1:24:30] dictate to you your future
[1:24:36] if brother chris would have allowed his
[1:24:38] past to dictate his future
[1:24:40] he wouldn't even have been here today
[1:24:43] but brother enoch elijah has been given
[1:24:46] to the lord with a great
[1:24:47] opportunity to have believers and to
[1:24:51] have saints that are supportive and
[1:24:54] are cheering him on and i don't even
[1:24:55] know the family very well but
[1:24:58] to know that there's believers and sons
[1:25:00] and daughters of god that are cheering
[1:25:02] saying
[1:25:02] you are blessed and lord we give this
[1:25:05] little child
[1:25:06] back into your arms and if you notice
[1:25:09] brother tim's words in closing
[1:25:11] that he would be healthy that he would
[1:25:13] be strong
[1:25:15] i believe those blessings follow an
[1:25:17] assembly
[1:25:19] they follow families do you all believe
[1:25:21] that here i believe you are part of of
[1:25:23] that great
[1:25:24] success you are blessed today
[1:25:32] i don't know brothers and sisters i'm
[1:25:35] sure it is with you
[1:25:36] as the year 2020 ended
[1:25:40] and the new year of 2021 came in and
[1:25:44] maybe you've received a lot of well
[1:25:46] wishes
[1:25:48] and blessings from many friends family
[1:25:50] maybe other believers
[1:25:52] did you all receive some blessings half
[1:25:55] of you
[1:25:56] did you all receive blessings people
[1:25:59] texting emailing cards come in the mail
[1:26:01] and
[1:26:03] from from around the world and then
[1:26:05] locally
[1:26:07] good messages they're blessings
[1:26:11] well let me say it like this what if it
[1:26:14] would have been opposite
[1:26:17] what if you just would have got a bunch
[1:26:18] of cursings and swearings
[1:26:22] what if your circle would have been well
[1:26:24] just go to and it was a place you don't
[1:26:26] want to go to
[1:26:30] what if it would have been a gun in your
[1:26:31] face
[1:26:33] what if it would have been under a
[1:26:35] bridge somewhere that's where you live
[1:26:40] i drove into seattle it was three
[1:26:42] o'clock in the morning
[1:26:44] on friday morning coming to seattle to
[1:26:46] fly here
[1:26:47] and as when you come into seattle on the
[1:26:49] main interstate now
[1:26:54] now you have tents and you have tarps
[1:26:56] and you have people living homeless and
[1:26:58] under bridges and on the side of the
[1:26:59] road
[1:27:01] that's where the economy is that's where
[1:27:03] it's going
[1:27:06] i i think often a brother branham that
[1:27:08] saw the vision of his brother-in-law
[1:27:10] that
[1:27:11] on this side of the road there was just
[1:27:13] you know
[1:27:14] all kinds of little fires and things and
[1:27:16] he had tried to help his brother-in-law
[1:27:17] and
[1:27:18] try you remember that brother aaron he
[1:27:19] tried to help him and he'd just
[1:27:21] give up for alcohol in his life he had
[1:27:23] thrown it away and his wife left him
[1:27:25] and his children left him
[1:27:28] and brother branham was looking at that
[1:27:30] and then he looked to this side
[1:27:31] there in mount montana and he saw the
[1:27:33] peaks
[1:27:35] and he said your name your future is in
[1:27:39] that mountain
[1:27:40] do you remember that it had to do with
[1:27:42] the third pole in his life
[1:27:44] and all the dips and then the valleys
[1:27:46] and then the mountains and
[1:27:48] he had all of that but the voice said to
[1:27:51] him
[1:27:51] look on this side that's exactly what
[1:27:54] you'll be
[1:27:54] like if you go where you're planning to
[1:27:58] go
[1:27:58] and what you want to do in your life
[1:28:00] that's what you're going to be
[1:28:04] i thank god today we are surrounded by
[1:28:07] men and women
[1:28:08] that love the lord just give me jesus i
[1:28:11] mean
[1:28:11] we we kind of so think that oh it goes
[1:28:14] without saying right we're in church
[1:28:16] but to have a song leader say that's why
[1:28:19] we're here today
[1:28:20] do you just want more of the lord
[1:28:25] when some of you i know we're in the
[1:28:27] rock concerts and in the parties and at
[1:28:29] the
[1:28:30] places of amusement and you were just so
[1:28:32] energetic and trying to find
[1:28:34] your blessing your blessing and it
[1:28:37] turned to be a curse
[1:28:40] to know that god has turned that around
[1:28:43] in 2021
[1:28:44] and stopped with an angel
[1:28:47] [Applause]
[1:28:49] you have been interrupted by a message
[1:28:52] that has said you don't need to go that
[1:28:54] way i know your future
[1:28:56] i know what lies ahead turn
[1:29:01] turn
[1:29:06] you don't belong in the pigpen you don't
[1:29:08] belong in this place
[1:29:12] even a believer let me stretch it out a
[1:29:14] little bit even a believer
[1:29:16] that goes through a time of sickness and
[1:29:18] goes to a time of pain and
[1:29:20] maybe something attacks them they're not
[1:29:23] called to be like
[1:29:24] that and they're groaning they're just
[1:29:27] stretching they're saying why
[1:29:28] and they're fighting against this
[1:29:30] something whatever it is
[1:29:32] say why is that it's a new body
[1:29:36] it's another place calling to you it's
[1:29:39] your blessing it's your final
[1:29:41] blessing one day but now we have trouble
[1:29:46] now we're in a robe of flesh oh yeah six
[1:29:49] months ago
[1:29:51] a year ago i remember
[1:29:54] brother tim the last sunday night that
[1:29:57] we were here
[1:29:59] and it was before your last youth camp
[1:30:01] and we were speaking about
[1:30:03] wine and oil and how you had been a
[1:30:06] blessing
[1:30:07] to countless many that were coming i
[1:30:09] think the very next week and you were
[1:30:11] sharing your wine and you were sharing
[1:30:14] your your church you were sharing your
[1:30:16] your ministry you were sharing you were
[1:30:18] to bless others
[1:30:21] and you you were to be you were giving
[1:30:23] that wine that stimulation so that
[1:30:25] somebody else
[1:30:26] could receive what you had and what does
[1:30:30] that create for you
[1:30:31] a blessing it's more blessed to give
[1:30:36] than to receive blessed is she
[1:30:40] have you been blessed
[1:30:46] gabriel
[1:30:51] it's while she's meditating and
[1:30:53] pondering on i don't understand how this
[1:30:55] could all be happening in my body and in
[1:30:57] my life
[1:30:57] that i bring forth a virgin you're gonna
[1:31:00] bring
[1:31:01] forth emmanuel
[1:31:06] an angel is talking to her do we believe
[1:31:10] the met the bible
[1:31:11] you know what brother branham said it's
[1:31:13] usually while you are thinking on these
[1:31:15] things
[1:31:16] the reason you don't see more of this
[1:31:18] we've got our minds on
[1:31:20] too many other things i just say god
[1:31:23] help us
[1:31:25] let's turn let's not just turn a new
[1:31:27] calendar
[1:31:28] from the very first sunday let us say
[1:31:31] lord
[1:31:31] i am i am consecrating myself this year
[1:31:36] that my mind not be on so many other
[1:31:38] things
[1:31:40] can we all agree on that this is january
[1:31:43] the very first
[1:31:44] sunday the reason that angels appeared
[1:31:47] to mary
[1:31:48] she was pondering the word she was
[1:31:50] thinking about the promises
[1:31:52] and that's when angels we it's usually
[1:31:56] why we are thinking on these things
[1:31:59] not following our our feed and our news
[1:32:02] feed and
[1:32:03] you know now our lives have changed you
[1:32:04] got certain time and if you give that to
[1:32:07] youtube
[1:32:07] if you give that to certain other things
[1:32:09] it's just empty it's just there's no
[1:32:12] power there
[1:32:13] there's no life there and you and you
[1:32:15] wonder why your life becomes
[1:32:17] powerless while you start to lose the
[1:32:19] joy
[1:32:20] why do you lose connection with people
[1:32:25] because you're more connected with a
[1:32:26] device
[1:32:31] god help us this year it's just an angel
[1:32:34] bringing that to our attention it's
[1:32:36] reality that
[1:32:37] angels appear to those that have their
[1:32:39] minds on
[1:32:40] the word
[1:32:44] let's go back to luke chapter one i
[1:32:46] wanted to just bring something to your
[1:32:48] attention
[1:32:53] luke chapter 1 verse 7. i want to bring
[1:32:56] something to your attention
[1:32:59] and this has to do with relationships
[1:33:02] zachariah and elizabeth were older ones
[1:33:05] in the message
[1:33:07] he was the high priest in verse 7 luke 1
[1:33:11] 7 they had no child because elizabeth
[1:33:13] was barren and they were
[1:33:15] both were now well stricken in years
[1:33:24] do you in verse 11 up there appeared
[1:33:27] unto zechariah an
[1:33:28] angel of the lord standing on the right
[1:33:30] side of the altar
[1:33:32] wow you talk about going to church and
[1:33:34] an angel is standing right
[1:33:36] there and he's got your attention and he
[1:33:38] tells you you're going to bring forth a
[1:33:40] son
[1:33:42] is that incredible your wife is barren
[1:33:45] i i looked it up how old they were and
[1:33:48] it's not real clear
[1:33:49] they they they were at least in their
[1:33:51] 50s or 60s or maybe even older
[1:33:55] it's incredible these were i'm speaking
[1:33:58] about the elders and the message and the
[1:34:00] older ones that have
[1:34:01] stayed strong and they were stalwarts
[1:34:03] zechariah was the high priest
[1:34:05] elizabeth was a believer
[1:34:09] and now an angel appears and says you're
[1:34:12] going to bring forth a son now
[1:34:14] i'm just bridging this over to something
[1:34:16] very important
[1:34:18] zechariah is going to ask a question
[1:34:21] he's going to ask a question and god was
[1:34:23] not happy with that
[1:34:25] and he smote him dumb
[1:34:29] for months until finally john was born
[1:34:33] or the word came to pass
[1:34:35] and he was able to take out a little
[1:34:37] tablet and say his name shall be john
[1:34:39] and he came
[1:34:40] his speech came out glory to god
[1:34:44] he was able to hallelujah and it came
[1:34:46] hallelujah
[1:34:47] i want to show you though how a question
[1:34:50] to one person
[1:34:52] can cause you to become dumb
[1:34:56] but a question that mary had a question
[1:35:00] how can these things be but brother
[1:35:03] david i don't understand
[1:35:06] it shows how you can have a question
[1:35:08] that is skeptical
[1:35:09] that is coming negative i mean zechariah
[1:35:12] was a believer
[1:35:15] but he questioned it in a way that
[1:35:17] caused him to be dumb
[1:35:21] here's mary a teenager that was younger
[1:35:24] that had
[1:35:25] a similar question how is this going to
[1:35:27] be i'm a virgin
[1:35:28] how is how are these things going to be
[1:35:32] but it brought forth life
[1:35:38] in verse 18 luke 1 18 and zechariah said
[1:35:41] unto the angel
[1:35:42] whereby shall i know this for i am an
[1:35:46] old man and my wife well stricken in
[1:35:49] years
[1:35:50] and the angel answering said unto him i
[1:35:53] am gaber and it goes on to speak about
[1:35:54] this wonderful wonderful
[1:35:56] this is wonderful this is the message
[1:35:58] this is the bible
[1:36:01] but what i wanted to bring to your
[1:36:03] attention
[1:36:04] is that he became dumb he couldn't speak
[1:36:07] for months
[1:36:08] because of a question and as it goes on
[1:36:12] in verse 26
[1:36:13] an angel same angel gabriel appeared
[1:36:16] verse 27 to mary to a virgin
[1:36:21] and begins to speak to her verse 28 and
[1:36:24] the angel came unto her and
[1:36:26] saluted her and says you are favored you
[1:36:28] are blessed of the lord
[1:36:29] and verse 34 this is luke 1 34
[1:36:33] then said mary unto the angel how shall
[1:36:37] this be
[1:36:39] seen i know not a a man is there a
[1:36:42] question mark there
[1:36:44] bible trivia question real open book
[1:36:47] question it's on the screen
[1:36:49] there's a question mark there right it's
[1:36:51] a question
[1:36:53] did god get angry with her
[1:36:58] did god strike her dumb did god do
[1:37:00] something that would cause his sharp
[1:37:02] rebuke for
[1:37:03] a teenager that should have caught it in
[1:37:05] the last meeting or
[1:37:06] you know the last meeting brother joe
[1:37:08] took a few weeks ago you should have
[1:37:09] caught it or the last youth meeting
[1:37:11] you should have caught it did he rebuke
[1:37:13] mary
[1:37:14] i'm asking a question
[1:37:18] so you can ask a question and it be
[1:37:22] with something's just not right
[1:37:24] zechariah could have says i believe you
[1:37:26] i don't understand it but
[1:37:28] yes lord this is he could have started
[1:37:30] weeping and saying that was the desire
[1:37:32] of elizabeth and my heart for many many
[1:37:34] years but it came from an
[1:37:36] unbelief and i'm going to major on that
[1:37:39] there was something in his heart that
[1:37:41] even though he was a high priest a
[1:37:43] minister
[1:37:43] an elder all of those years when it came
[1:37:47] to that year
[1:37:49] how was this going to be and god stroke
[1:37:52] him dumb
[1:37:54] but because god was moving in mary's
[1:37:56] heart
[1:37:57] and i want to bridge this with elizabeth
[1:38:00] now being
[1:38:01] older and well stricken in years
[1:38:04] mary being a teenager yet they had a
[1:38:07] relationship
[1:38:09] and luke chapter 1 verse 39
[1:38:12] you'll find after the mayor the angel
[1:38:15] spoke to mary and mary arose in those
[1:38:17] days and went into the hill country
[1:38:19] verse 40
[1:38:20] and she entered into the house of
[1:38:21] zechariah and saluted elizabeth so you
[1:38:24] have
[1:38:25] just a teenager heard from an angel
[1:38:30] coming to an elder in the message 60
[1:38:33] years old maybe 70
[1:38:35] she she also had had her husband
[1:38:38] had saw an angel had a pier and she was
[1:38:41] pregnant
[1:38:42] but there was there had not been a lot
[1:38:44] of movement
[1:38:45] in that season
[1:38:49] there hadn't been a lot of movement in
[1:38:51] the season
[1:38:52] elizabeth had the word she had the
[1:38:55] promise there had even been an angel up
[1:38:57] here
[1:38:58] to her husband but when she went home
[1:39:01] to talk about it her husband was dumb
[1:39:07] god help us but now a younger generation
[1:39:11] was coming up that believed the word
[1:39:12] they took a hold of that there was life
[1:39:14] and
[1:39:14] now they're coming together i'm not
[1:39:16] speaking anything negative
[1:39:17] this is actually very positive there was
[1:39:20] a relationship there was a connection
[1:39:23] it wasn't like mary ran to her teenage
[1:39:25] friends
[1:39:26] she ran to someone that was having the
[1:39:29] experience of the word
[1:39:30] at the same time hallelujah
[1:39:34] god give us friends this year that are
[1:39:36] spiritual
[1:39:38] let's rejoice together say i don't have
[1:39:40] a friend or
[1:39:41] i don't have a connection well why don't
[1:39:43] you just ask him
[1:39:44] on the first sunday of the year you've
[1:39:47] had a lot of friends
[1:39:48] break your trust they're not they break
[1:39:50] your confidence
[1:39:52] they do thumbs down they might be a
[1:39:55] christian but when you get around them
[1:39:57] they're negative they they're talking
[1:39:58] about you know the politics or the
[1:40:00] lsu or the camelites or whatever or
[1:40:03] they're talking about their truck or
[1:40:04] their car
[1:40:05] and you just want reality
[1:40:08] why don't you ask god for a friend like
[1:40:10] that this year
[1:40:14] just somebody you can share your heart
[1:40:20] with
[1:40:25] do you know what i got a note right here
[1:40:26] in front of me it's from my wife
[1:40:28] don't preach too long
[1:40:33] i got it right here brother tim
[1:40:38] she's probably streaming she probably
[1:40:39] just logged off right now
[1:40:45] but there's a lot of things we could
[1:40:46] speak about that
[1:40:49] about a confidant
[1:40:53] a confidant or a counselor someone you
[1:40:56] can
[1:40:57] share a secret or private matters with
[1:40:59] it
[1:41:01] you're trusting them not to repeat it to
[1:41:03] others
[1:41:06] you say this person was a close
[1:41:07] confidant of the president or
[1:41:10] the princes just she had a close
[1:41:13] confidant a best friend
[1:41:16] or a close associate and some of you
[1:41:19] might say where are you coming from
[1:41:21] do you know this comes right out of the
[1:41:23] book of isaiah speaking about
[1:41:25] jesus christ that his name shall be
[1:41:29] called
[1:41:30] wonderful he's a mighty god he's the
[1:41:34] prince of peace
[1:41:35] but he's also a counselor
[1:41:38] how many know the bible says that that's
[1:41:40] right out of the book of isaiah
[1:41:46] maybe mary wish she had a friend that
[1:41:48] sunday morning and
[1:41:49] when he they read out of the book of
[1:41:50] isaiah that said wonderful
[1:41:52] and she was saying i want to wonder i
[1:41:54] wish i had a friend that was wonderful
[1:41:56] i wish i had peace not as the world
[1:42:00] gives but
[1:42:01] i want some peace
[1:42:05] and then something struck his name shall
[1:42:07] be called
[1:42:08] counselor a confidant
[1:42:13] someone i can talk to and share my
[1:42:16] innermost feelings with and know
[1:42:19] that when we walk out of the room or we
[1:42:21] get out of their car or we leave
[1:42:23] you know the table that it's not going
[1:42:24] to be texted to three
[1:42:26] and five in the chat group
[1:42:31] and two days go by and you find out half
[1:42:33] the church knows
[1:42:34] and in a week you find out everyone in
[1:42:36] the message knows it's like that is not
[1:42:38] a confident you have
[1:42:39] just broke i will never
[1:42:42] trust you again
[1:42:46] it was in this season of christmas
[1:42:53] when god was giving a promise that i'm
[1:42:56] gonna send you
[1:42:57] a counselor i i know he wasn't born in
[1:43:01] december he wasn't born on december 25th
[1:43:05] but when jesus came he was expressing
[1:43:08] the counselor has arrived your peace has
[1:43:10] arrived
[1:43:11] your mercy has arrived your healing has
[1:43:14] arrived
[1:43:14] if you need the holy ghost today he's
[1:43:17] present
[1:43:18] in the building do we believe that
[1:43:22] blessed are you that would open up your
[1:43:24] womb that
[1:43:25] an angel could speak to you and you say
[1:43:27] be it unto me lord
[1:43:31] i trust you i believe that you're gonna
[1:43:35] hold these things
[1:43:36] in your heart
[1:43:39] it is an intimate partner somebody that
[1:43:43] is very familiar with you
[1:43:47] maybe it could be a mentor an advisor a
[1:43:50] friend you can trust you can tell
[1:43:51] anything
[1:43:57] but i just want to end this right here
[1:43:59] but to break confidence
[1:44:01] is a bad character
[1:44:05] someone share something with you or
[1:44:07] something that you you think if i go to
[1:44:09] someone else and tell them it's going to
[1:44:10] win some points or you're going to
[1:44:12] somehow rise up and no you have just
[1:44:14] shown that you need more of the life of
[1:44:16] jesus
[1:44:17] that's not the nature of christ
[1:44:20] it's the nature of christ to hold that
[1:44:22] in your heart pray about that
[1:44:23] seek and if someone is in danger if
[1:44:26] there is a need that you go
[1:44:27] to someone else that is a maybe a senior
[1:44:30] confidant or someone and you can share
[1:44:32] that family's in danger that child is in
[1:44:34] danger
[1:44:35] that sister there's things going on
[1:44:37] let's get some help
[1:44:39] but i'm here to announce to you today it
[1:44:41] has to do with
[1:44:42] jesus
[1:44:46] that might sound shocking
[1:44:49] but 2021 is a year for you to just open
[1:44:52] up your heart
[1:44:53] you say well i do brother john in prayer
[1:44:54] i open it he's my counselor i
[1:44:57] i talk to him he knows all about me and
[1:44:59] he still loves me and we can get all in
[1:45:01] that realm of
[1:45:02] god knows all about me and he still
[1:45:04] loves me when we can get all but there's
[1:45:05] situations you go through as a believer
[1:45:11] that you need god with skin on him
[1:45:14] on her and let me just turn it right
[1:45:17] away i don't know who this is for
[1:45:19] the last seven minutes i don't know who
[1:45:20] it's for but may this year
[1:45:23] you be a person that you could be jesus
[1:45:25] to someone else
[1:45:27] and manifest isaiah scripture and be
[1:45:30] peace to someone else be a counselor be
[1:45:33] a confident
[1:45:35] be quiet
[1:45:38] and just listen
[1:45:50] maybe my wife's logged back on now and
[1:45:52] she can
[1:45:53] say don't be too long
[1:46:01] oh don't you want that freshness this
[1:46:03] year
[1:46:04] don't you just want to come out of an
[1:46:06] experience with god where his presence
[1:46:08] is so near his anointing
[1:46:10] where it's something that's sweet and
[1:46:13] smelling savior it's the holy spirit on
[1:46:15] you
[1:46:16] that when you begin to talk when you
[1:46:18] begin your attitude is different your
[1:46:20] life is different that means
[1:46:24] mary
[1:46:26] don't let it just be words on a sunday
[1:46:30] don't let it just be something you would
[1:46:32] share with your friend and
[1:46:34] talk about the word
[1:46:37] or that you can look to another person
[1:46:39] and say that's a great man of god
[1:46:42] that's a great lady that's a real great
[1:46:45] woman
[1:46:46] and let it stop there but let 2021
[1:46:50] i'm seeking to to minister to you a
[1:46:52] blessing let
[1:46:54] 2021 be a year
[1:46:58] where god can speak to you remember
[1:47:01] it wasn't just the womb that was being
[1:47:04] blessed
[1:47:07] it was the fruit of the womb
[1:47:10] it was what was going to come inside of
[1:47:12] that womb
[1:47:14] it was the life of god that was going to
[1:47:16] come inside of mary
[1:47:18] that was going to be the savior the
[1:47:20] healer the deliverer
[1:47:22] though it's just in seed form
[1:47:27] and that is what zechariah did not
[1:47:30] believe
[1:47:31] could happen they were old they were
[1:47:34] well stricken how can this be
[1:47:35] and god smote him it was a question
[1:47:39] sometimes you wonder why the holy spirit
[1:47:42] just maybe pulls back or why he's not
[1:47:44] maybe we need to just turn and be more
[1:47:46] like mary where we just believe the word
[1:47:48] of god
[1:47:49] well we just say lord for the next 20
[1:47:51] minutes i'm going to turn on a message
[1:47:52] i'm going to read
[1:47:53] whatever you say to me but don't be all
[1:47:56] religious and all
[1:47:57] in some spiritual fanaticism where you
[1:47:59] just take it
[1:48:00] and that's not the will of god you say i
[1:48:03] read my bible
[1:48:04] i i fasted i prayed be sensitive
[1:48:07] let it be thus saith the lord i had this
[1:48:10] on my heart brother tim and we shared it
[1:48:12] together i know he
[1:48:14] has spoken to you as your pastor but as
[1:48:16] i had it for the new year
[1:48:18] and brother branham in the last
[1:48:19] christmas message of his whole ministry
[1:48:22] he said god give me a church that's so
[1:48:24] completely anointed with god
[1:48:27] till their every action and move is thus
[1:48:30] saith the lord
[1:48:35] now some of us have just we just cut off
[1:48:38] right there
[1:48:39] every action i mean brother john
[1:48:42] every action brother
[1:48:46] james how can these things be every
[1:48:50] action
[1:48:52] every move is thus saith the lord
[1:48:56] that that's a too high of a bar it's
[1:48:59] like trying to pole vault and it's 24
[1:49:02] feet and you're just
[1:49:03] no no i'm not even going to try i'm not
[1:49:04] even going to run that's what a lot of
[1:49:06] us do
[1:49:08] we hear the word we hear great preaching
[1:49:10] we can be in dynamic services and then
[1:49:13] as for me and then we go out to our van
[1:49:15] or out to our cars
[1:49:16] no way brother joe can jump that high
[1:49:20] brother aaron is really growing brother
[1:49:22] brother tim brother timothy look at how
[1:49:24] their
[1:49:24] ministries have just but when it comes
[1:49:26] down to you it's kind of like
[1:49:28] short circuit kind of like the question
[1:49:30] mark and that is where zechariah
[1:49:32] failed and become dumb and and the power
[1:49:36] was lost let's be like mary's
[1:49:41] that have that quick heart to say i
[1:49:43] believe
[1:49:45] and it's not cutting off everyone else
[1:49:47] and i wish we had more time but
[1:49:50] i want to say that again about elizabeth
[1:49:51] and mary they had a relationship
[1:49:54] and mary went to her elder sister and
[1:49:56] they were rejoicing
[1:49:57] if you hear brother branham talk about
[1:49:59] it they ran to one another
[1:50:01] and elizabeth looked out her window and
[1:50:03] saw her cousin
[1:50:04] cousin mary coming to the house she was
[1:50:07] so happy
[1:50:08] she ran out there and hugged one another
[1:50:12] it wasn't all this you know static and
[1:50:15] thing
[1:50:15] but god gave us more relationships like
[1:50:17] that they believed one another and it's
[1:50:19] like how can this be
[1:50:21] mary you're expecting but i didn't know
[1:50:24] you were married and i didn't even get
[1:50:25] him
[1:50:26] uninvited sister adams
[1:50:29] i didn't even get in i'm your cousin no
[1:50:32] no it's not like that it's not like that
[1:50:35] i had an angel appear to me
[1:50:38] that said you're going to bring forth a
[1:50:40] child and his name shall be called
[1:50:43] jesus
[1:50:47] verse 41 luke 1 41 and while they were
[1:50:51] speaking some of you just thought a
[1:50:52] salutation was like i salute you you
[1:50:54] know i salute you but
[1:50:55] the salutation has to do with the words
[1:50:57] that are spoken
[1:50:58] it has to do with intercourse and a
[1:51:00] conversation they begin to talk about
[1:51:03] this
[1:51:04] his name shall be called jesus
[1:51:07] she's given her testimony
[1:51:12] this is what happened
[1:51:15] nervous nervous i never saw an angel
[1:51:18] like
[1:51:18] that before and the lights and the flick
[1:51:21] and i was trembling
[1:51:22] well what did you say well i said
[1:51:24] exactly what the bible says
[1:51:26] how shall this be i don't know a man i'm
[1:51:29] innocent
[1:51:30] i'm innocent you know what elizabeth
[1:51:33] she's hearing this you know
[1:51:35] but you're expecting but i i didn't know
[1:51:38] you were married no we're not married
[1:51:40] we're not married this was huge
[1:51:44] i this christmas i have got more respect
[1:51:47] for joseph
[1:51:48] than ever
[1:51:51] if you go to the book of matthew when
[1:51:53] you got some time math
[1:51:55] when joseph which was an older man than
[1:51:57] mary when he heard
[1:51:59] that his wife was pregnant my beautiful
[1:52:03] young lady in the message that she's a
[1:52:05] virgin
[1:52:06] and she's expecting the bible says he
[1:52:08] was going to put her away
[1:52:11] privately not on facebook not on
[1:52:14] instagram
[1:52:16] not with a broken heart symbol and send
[1:52:19] it to the church and to the message chat
[1:52:22] joseph was a man of character
[1:52:26] and he just realized i just get my
[1:52:29] hearts broken
[1:52:31] we'll just take care of this privately
[1:52:34] and by the way i'm crushed
[1:52:39] i'll never marry again that's what's
[1:52:42] going through his mind
[1:52:44] do you all know that that's what
[1:52:46] matthew's talking about
[1:52:51] he didn't want to make her a public
[1:52:52] example and embarrass her
[1:52:55] i'll let her go on and be a believer but
[1:52:57] i will not
[1:52:59] embarrass her
[1:53:02] but while he thought on these things
[1:53:06] he's pondering how can i handle this
[1:53:09] she's a believer i'm a believer she's
[1:53:12] expecting
[1:53:13] i don't believe you that you've been not
[1:53:16] been with another person
[1:53:18] mary how could you be this way and no no
[1:53:21] that
[1:53:22] there was a believing hearts there was
[1:53:24] believing hearts
[1:53:29] you know we don't have the we don't have
[1:53:31] the bankrolls of hollywood and we don't
[1:53:33] have all the millions and billions to
[1:53:35] make this more real
[1:53:36] but i pray the holy ghost so make this
[1:53:38] real the first sunday of the year
[1:53:40] how blessed you are joseph you're
[1:53:42] blessed you're handling this
[1:53:44] with dignity and he's ready to put her
[1:53:46] away and that
[1:53:47] very season while he's thinking about
[1:53:50] this the angel of the lord
[1:53:54] brother andrew while you're praying
[1:53:57] about this
[1:53:57] and lord what should i do what would
[1:54:00] bring the most
[1:54:00] glory brother george to your name lord
[1:54:04] you know my life you know everything
[1:54:06] lord
[1:54:09] and i know that i failed you i i'm not
[1:54:12] the best
[1:54:13] christian i'm not the most beautiful
[1:54:15] person in the church i'm not the
[1:54:17] best singer or the best preacher we all
[1:54:20] go through that emotion
[1:54:22] don't we say i'm embarrassed lord
[1:54:25] 2020 if i look back and you say
[1:54:29] is your life worthy of the gospel
[1:54:33] maybe some would say believers would say
[1:54:35] i'm embarrassed
[1:54:37] well i hope the the minister don't know
[1:54:40] or i hope the deacons
[1:54:41] don't find out we can kind of live under
[1:54:43] that
[1:54:44] but let's start out 2021 with a full
[1:54:47] consecration
[1:54:49] dedication and say i'm blessed that
[1:54:52] god's even talking to me like this
[1:54:54] that in your season of distress little
[1:54:57] do you know
[1:54:58] angels are already being dispatched go
[1:55:01] talk to that sister
[1:55:02] go talk to that brother let the opening
[1:55:05] song be this
[1:55:10] let the minister say something that i
[1:55:12] know
[1:55:13] that would be for me
[1:55:17] do we still believe in the same god that
[1:55:19] can speak through a
[1:55:20] dumb animal like a donkey
[1:55:24] to a person that should have known
[1:55:26] better a man of god that was going
[1:55:28] on a mission and and this donkey you all
[1:55:31] know the bible word for that right the
[1:55:32] donkey and he was
[1:55:33] slamming the guy's leg up against the
[1:55:35] wall there was an angel
[1:55:37] standing in front of me don't you see
[1:55:39] this angel
[1:55:42] he's talking to me
[1:55:46] the man of god that should have known
[1:55:48] better
[1:55:51] now an animal's having to talk to you
[1:55:54] and tell there's an angel standing in
[1:55:57] the pathway
[1:56:00] with a great big sword and saying you
[1:56:02] step another i'ma take your head off
[1:56:04] can't you see this angel and and and the
[1:56:07] prophet probably looked at this animal
[1:56:08] you and he's beating the
[1:56:10] poor animal god help us this year god
[1:56:14] help us
[1:56:15] we can get so stubborn so hard-headed so
[1:56:18] seeing it your way
[1:56:19] my way but the highway
[1:56:23] until finally god says you're going to
[1:56:25] walk down the highway then you're going
[1:56:28] to have that kind of attitude you're
[1:56:29] going to sow these kind of seeds
[1:56:31] that's what's going to come up in your
[1:56:32] garden
[1:56:36] you know friends only the blood of jesus
[1:56:40] has the power to cover 2020.
[1:56:44] only the blood of jesus has the power
[1:56:47] and authority
[1:56:48] to say you never did it let's wipe that
[1:56:50] clean let's go on
[1:56:51] let's turn not just turn a page but god
[1:56:54] fill us lord
[1:56:55] with that kind of character that kind of
[1:56:58] nature that will say lord
[1:56:59] be it unto me according into your word
[1:57:02] whatever you say
[1:57:04] i'll do that not a man
[1:57:08] god himself
[1:57:11] god give us more mary's and joseph like
[1:57:15] i was saying i was driving
[1:57:16] into our subdivision these last couple
[1:57:18] of weeks and joseph just
[1:57:20] came into my heart i thought my what a
[1:57:22] man
[1:57:23] joseph
[1:57:26] that just held himself in kind of a
[1:57:28] character that angels could appear to
[1:57:31] him
[1:57:32] can you put that up sister abigail
[1:57:34] matthew 1
[1:57:36] 20. matthew 1 20 while he thought on
[1:57:39] these things
[1:57:41] behold the angel of the lord appeared
[1:57:42] unto him in a dream
[1:57:45] saying joseph thou son of david fear not
[1:57:47] to take unto thee mary thy wife for that
[1:57:49] which is
[1:57:49] conceived in her as of the holy ghost
[1:57:53] wow all this all the churning
[1:57:57] ends all the wondering all the questions
[1:58:00] she just lays it all down there and says
[1:58:01] that's it
[1:58:04] amen wouldn't it be fantastic if it was
[1:58:07] all in one verse the whole
[1:58:08] everything you prayed for there it is
[1:58:13] it's called a divine intervention
[1:58:17] it's called being interrupted by an
[1:58:20] angel
[1:58:21] it's a teenager that's just taken a walk
[1:58:27] her life totally changes forever
[1:58:32] and he goes on to speak in matthew
[1:58:34] chapter
[1:58:35] 1 verse 20.
[1:58:39] verse 24 is exactly what 2021 needs to
[1:58:42] be for all of us
[1:58:43] then joseph being raised from sleep did
[1:58:45] as the angel of the lord had bid in him
[1:58:47] and took unto him his wife and knew her
[1:58:49] not
[1:58:50] till she had brought forth her firstborn
[1:58:52] son and he called his name
[1:58:54] jesus who would want to bring forth
[1:58:57] jesus this year
[1:59:00] blessed are you that you even have this
[1:59:04] kind of
[1:59:04] desire as we wind down now at the end of
[1:59:08] our
[1:59:08] service now as we come down to 2020 as
[1:59:11] we come down
[1:59:12] to us and a prophet says just ending his
[1:59:14] last christmas message saying
[1:59:16] lord give me a church that's so
[1:59:18] completely anointed with god
[1:59:20] till their every action and move is thus
[1:59:23] saith the lord
[1:59:24] where they walk in that shekinah glory
[1:59:26] and i'll show you a messiah
[1:59:28] an anointed one of god standing upon the
[1:59:31] earth
[1:59:32] does jesus deserve to have a bride like
[1:59:35] that
[1:59:36] in 2021 that will say be it unto me lord
[1:59:39] how many believe he's worthy he is
[1:59:42] worthy
[1:59:48] this is what i say to you today
[1:59:51] for your prayer life for your time alone
[1:59:55] with the lord and your secret time this
[1:59:57] year from this
[1:59:58] moment on
[2:00:01] may there be a presence of god
[2:00:04] and an anointing of a sweet smelling
[2:00:08] savor
[2:00:09] upon your life
[2:00:13] may the holy spirit visit you
[2:00:17] and may a message from god
[2:00:20] to your hungry waiting hearts
[2:00:24] be so clear that you would be walk
[2:00:28] out of that experience and say god spoke
[2:00:30] to me
[2:00:33] can we all agree hello everyone you got
[2:00:36] texts you got
[2:00:37] cards you got all kinds of blessings i
[2:00:39] bless you i bless you
[2:00:40] and all kinds of greetings and things
[2:00:43] brother john even put it in these notes
[2:00:45] today we have all kinds of
[2:00:46] well wishes and blessings from friends
[2:00:49] family
[2:00:49] believers
[2:00:52] but today when we really look into the
[2:00:54] deep parts of our hearts
[2:00:56] we are all blessed
[2:01:01] but when you hear all of these things
[2:01:03] that i just gone through and
[2:01:05] they have virtual celebrations and new
[2:01:08] year's resolutions and
[2:01:09] all the lights and the whistles and the
[2:01:11] salutations of people
[2:01:13] but the bride is going for something
[2:01:15] much deeper than that
[2:01:17] something beyond just the surface happy
[2:01:20] new year
[2:01:20] sister jessica happy new year and we
[2:01:23] smile we know oh that's nice thank you
[2:01:25] we get a text and we thank you we
[2:01:27] respond and thank you very much happy
[2:01:29] new year
[2:01:30] god bless your 2021 maybe two lines or
[2:01:33] three lines and then it's over
[2:01:38] god may this blessing be much deeper
[2:01:42] than that
[2:01:47] because blessed is more than just a
[2:01:49] touch
[2:01:50] to be blessed is more than just a
[2:01:52] passing blessing i bless you sister
[2:01:54] anita
[2:01:55] nice to see you this afternoon now and
[2:01:59] god bless your family
[2:02:00] and then we go and we fly away but the
[2:02:04] blessing that i'm speaking about blessed
[2:02:06] is she
[2:02:08] is now god's heart to the bride
[2:02:12] mary was blessed because she believed
[2:02:15] but the bride has been declared blessed
[2:02:18] because she believes the believers of
[2:02:22] this message are blessed
[2:02:24] because they believe but this morning
[2:02:27] that today
[2:02:28] it's more than a passing blessing it's
[2:02:31] more than just saying
[2:02:32] uh here's a good blessing i bless you
[2:02:35] but it goes
[2:02:36] then it goes away and it's no more or
[2:02:39] it's just a visit
[2:02:41] you know the family visited or jesus
[2:02:43] visited us today but then he's gone
[2:02:46] and i'm kind of back to my life i'm kind
[2:02:48] of back to my thoughts i'm back to my
[2:02:51] that's not a real blessing you say that
[2:02:55] song really blessed me that sermon
[2:02:57] really blessed me but a momentary
[2:02:59] blessing is not what the bride
[2:03:01] is craving for just help us now when
[2:03:05] when let's just turn back to luke
[2:03:07] chapter
[2:03:08] one now as we just see what elizabeth
[2:03:11] was saying in
[2:03:12] luke 1 41 and it came to pass that when
[2:03:15] elizabeth heard the salutation of mary
[2:03:17] the babe leaped in her womb
[2:03:20] and elizabeth was filled with the holy
[2:03:22] ghost
[2:03:23] and she spake out with a loud voice and
[2:03:26] said blessed
[2:03:26] art thou among women and blessed is the
[2:03:29] fruit of thy womb it wasn't just a
[2:03:31] momentary shout shout o
[2:03:33] glory to god just like
[2:03:36] it was like wow mary
[2:03:42] don't you know how blessed you are
[2:03:47] that the fruit of your womb is
[2:03:50] jesus he's emmanuel it means god is
[2:03:53] going to be with us forever
[2:03:56] does everybody understand what brother
[2:03:58] john's trying to say that a blessing is
[2:04:00] more than god bless you brother and
[2:04:01] now we can't even hardly shake hands we
[2:04:03] say you know i can't even see you after
[2:04:05] service harley to
[2:04:06] shake your hand and just give me a big
[2:04:08] hug but it's like you know
[2:04:09] when we do this you know and it's like
[2:04:11] really
[2:04:15] really and the world's saying yeah
[2:04:18] really in fact we're going to tighten it
[2:04:19] down more and
[2:04:20] we don't know what's going to happen at
[2:04:21] the end of the month or february
[2:04:24] this is the moment when you hear god say
[2:04:28] after an angel has spoken to you
[2:04:30] that the lord has come to your womb and
[2:04:32] you're blessed
[2:04:33] for that full realization to become more
[2:04:36] than just a passing feeling
[2:04:38] and my the hairs came up on the on my
[2:04:40] arm or on the back of my
[2:04:41] it's more than that a blessing this is
[2:04:44] what elizabeth was saying
[2:04:46] blessed is the fruit of thy womb
[2:04:50] not your womb is blessed but the fruit
[2:04:52] what's inside of you
[2:04:54] is blessed
[2:04:57] verse 43 is a humbling verse and when
[2:05:00] says this to me
[2:05:01] that the mother of my lord should come
[2:05:03] to me
[2:05:04] she's an elder in the message saying
[2:05:07] this to a teenager
[2:05:09] it's like i'm blessed that you would
[2:05:11] even come and tell me about it
[2:05:13] what god's done for you
[2:05:16] that's an incredible testimony of how
[2:05:19] god has healed you
[2:05:23] right it's incredible it's a blessing
[2:05:26] like
[2:05:26] you say god did this for me and now
[2:05:29] we're through that
[2:05:32] god healed us from this certain thing
[2:05:33] and 2020 was a year and
[2:05:37] i hope 21. yeah i'm glad 2020 is over
[2:05:40] and now the birth of 21.
[2:05:45] but unless that revelation really drops
[2:05:47] deeper and
[2:05:48] sinks way down how blessed you really
[2:05:50] are that jesus christ
[2:05:53] has chosen your womb your life to be
[2:05:55] born in
[2:05:57] and to live the rest of your life
[2:06:01] he wants to live the rest of your life
[2:06:04] say how long is that for eternity
[2:06:08] does everyone believe that here eternal
[2:06:10] life is forever
[2:06:12] so you might take my body
[2:06:16] you might destroy it but inside of this
[2:06:19] womb is a life that is blessed
[2:06:23] and i'm a male brother saying that and
[2:06:26] so i'm not talking about physically
[2:06:27] i'm talking about in my soul in the
[2:06:30] innermost being in the inner
[2:06:32] heart of the heart is a life of god
[2:06:35] that has been birthed in this hour and
[2:06:38] i'm not ashamed of it
[2:06:40] we ought to be able to tell the world
[2:06:43] jesus is alive
[2:06:45] and others around us ought to see the
[2:06:47] blessings of god
[2:06:49] in your decisions they don't need to
[2:06:52] know all the details
[2:06:53] it's like wow i can see it on your face
[2:07:03] i i could just tell that sister
[2:07:06] she's living in another world
[2:07:13] because what was in her womb has now
[2:07:15] become
[2:07:16] what was private has now become public
[2:07:20] and you can see she's a great woman
[2:07:25] and we don't have time to turn to that
[2:07:26] but that's in first the second kings the
[2:07:28] bible says in shunam
[2:07:30] the shunamite woman she was a great
[2:07:32] woman
[2:07:33] the bible says that she was a great
[2:07:35] woman
[2:07:36] because she made room for the prophet a
[2:07:39] little bed
[2:07:40] a little lamp we would say a little
[2:07:43] light a little torch a little
[2:07:44] desk right she's a great woman
[2:07:49] and this year you are a great person
[2:07:53] when you make room for god's word
[2:07:57] friends you only have one life 24 hours
[2:08:00] you can do
[2:08:00] whatever you want to with 2021
[2:08:05] it's like an open calendar and there's
[2:08:07] just a few exes now you know the first
[2:08:09] and the second
[2:08:10] here we are on the first sunday and
[2:08:12] you've got a few exes
[2:08:14] when i go home that's what brother john
[2:08:16] will do and i'll go in my office
[2:08:17] and i got a calendar from brother harold
[2:08:19] hildebrant and i'll go x
[2:08:22] x and i was in louisiana in the third x
[2:08:24] but now it's monday
[2:08:29] and you've got a life in front of you
[2:08:30] you've got a life in front of you
[2:08:33] don't you want to just just ponder and
[2:08:35] meditate
[2:08:36] on the blessing of god and the blessing
[2:08:38] is not oh i bless you
[2:08:40] it's not that we want a visitor that's
[2:08:42] just passing blessings we want more than
[2:08:44] just
[2:08:44] a good feeling that leaves but a
[2:08:46] blessing is to be a touch
[2:08:48] a touch that lingers
[2:08:53] it's an influence that stays
[2:08:57] to stay monday
[2:09:00] tuesday wednesday morning i'm thinking
[2:09:03] about what sister karen said
[2:09:05] this morning or yesterday it's that is a
[2:09:08] blessing
[2:09:09] that is mormon a momentary blessing it's
[2:09:12] a testimony
[2:09:14] i've been with the counselor
[2:09:17] on sunday what happened to you i was
[2:09:19] with the prince of peace
[2:09:21] when everybody's anxious and upset and
[2:09:24] don't know if you're gonna get laid off
[2:09:26] this this month or what's gonna happen
[2:09:28] with our finances
[2:09:29] and and what's going to go on in the
[2:09:32] schools are we going to do it virtual
[2:09:34] are we going to be at home are we going
[2:09:36] to go are we what
[2:09:37] what and we can get so caught up and
[2:09:39] consumed like that
[2:09:41] that we forget the blessing
[2:09:44] the blessing is something that just
[2:09:45] lingers it's like a hand on your
[2:09:47] shoulder
[2:09:50] it's an eternal deposit
[2:09:53] that brings interest to you that are
[2:09:55] bankers or interested in that
[2:09:58] the the blessing that i'm speaking about
[2:10:00] today is an eternal deposit
[2:10:03] that brings interest you just look and
[2:10:05] that just says more
[2:10:06] then it's more then it's more and it
[2:10:09] grows
[2:10:10] and it's like wow that's incredible did
[2:10:12] you hear what that minister said
[2:10:14] honey did you know this is what he said
[2:10:17] that's what the word says it's so great
[2:10:21] it's so much
[2:10:21] better than fussing and fighting
[2:10:25] i have it right here but brother branham
[2:10:26] said don't fuss
[2:10:28] don't get in family fusses angels don't
[2:10:32] appear to people that fuss
[2:10:34] families that are always fussing and
[2:10:36] fighting and throwing things and
[2:10:39] angels won't appear then they wonder why
[2:10:41] angels aren't following them why
[2:10:43] why they don't have help why do why is
[2:10:45] it always an emergency why is it always
[2:10:48] 9-1-1
[2:10:50] lord send angels that follow us this
[2:10:52] year
[2:10:53] follow our attitude follow our spirit we
[2:10:56] try to go to a place that he doesn't
[2:10:57] want to go in
[2:10:58] we just feel something grabbing a hold
[2:11:00] of our belt and yanking us out of there
[2:11:02] we're like whoa
[2:11:03] lord you saved me you delivered me and
[2:11:05] not with some bad attitude i'm going
[2:11:07] anyway i'm going
[2:11:09] who are you to talk to me who are you to
[2:11:11] you know sometimes you need a friend
[2:11:13] that will tell you opposite than what
[2:11:14] you want to hear
[2:11:19] you need somebody that'll be really
[2:11:20] really strong with you
[2:11:22] and you're just kind of cringing and
[2:11:24] kind of like wow and you're wanting to
[2:11:26] defend yourself
[2:11:29] but maybe this year you could be a
[2:11:31] friend that would just be able to take
[2:11:33] it
[2:11:35] and then maybe it's something you're not
[2:11:36] even guilty of
[2:11:38] and it's being all spread around you
[2:11:40] know this happened she said this he said
[2:11:43] that
[2:11:43] but your character can just be one that
[2:11:45] you know what that's okay
[2:11:49] just let it go we're kind of quiet today
[2:11:54] but do you realize that's the blessing
[2:11:56] of god on you
[2:11:57] that's a deposit on you that is a lot
[2:12:00] more money than you had six months ago
[2:12:02] because six months ago you would have
[2:12:03] ranted waved and there would have been
[2:12:05] all kinds of
[2:12:06] e-men things that went out and they went
[2:12:08] back wow their phone lit up after that
[2:12:10] well
[2:12:11] now it's just silence because you're
[2:12:14] blessed
[2:12:16] you realize god's given you so much more
[2:12:18] you don't even need to go down that
[2:12:20] pathway
[2:12:23] in fact god's got a better friend for
[2:12:25] you
[2:12:26] that'll keep your confidence and keep
[2:12:29] your trust
[2:12:31] and if you're constantly trying to hold
[2:12:32] up some relationship
[2:12:34] where they're backbiting and seeing your
[2:12:36] hind your parts and telling you
[2:12:37] you're not a good christian you need
[2:12:39] another friend
[2:12:41] you need somebody that'll build you up
[2:12:43] to encourage you
[2:12:48] thank you jesus so as we close with
[2:12:52] these verses
[2:12:53] luke 1 verse 44 for lo as soon as the
[2:12:57] voice of thy salutation
[2:12:59] sounded in mine ears the babe leaped
[2:13:02] in my womb for sadness
[2:13:05] they were such mourning and horrible
[2:13:07] just so
[2:13:09] is that what it was john the baptist

[2:13:15] cousin to jesus
[2:13:17] he's gonna be born first he has six
[2:13:19] months
[2:13:20] ahead but there's no life
[2:13:23] it's like he's laying right in the womb
[2:13:27] of a wonderful lady elizabeth and
[2:13:29] zachariah
[2:13:30] it's a wonderful family but there's no
[2:13:33] life
[2:13:34] they've heard a lot of things and been
[2:13:36] down the road
[2:13:37] but there's no life but as soon as they
[2:13:40] got in an atmosphere
[2:13:41] where jesus was let's talk about jesus
[2:13:46] what's god's done for you does anybody
[2:13:48] have a testimony
