[50:53] prophecies are now being fulfilled
[50:56] and the word of god is now being made
[50:58] manifested

[51:07] the revelation that christ has come
[51:10] and he's here today in bride form
[51:14] and he's coming again we'll meet him in
[51:15] the air
[51:17] and ascend with him with all the

[51:27] the promise has come
[51:30] i pray lord today
[51:32] that you'll just move in a mighty way
[51:36] father that you'll move the man part out
[51:38] and just let us be an oracle of god
[51:42] and father that you'll also deal with
[51:44] here that you'll give them ears to hear
[51:46] what the spirit is saying
[51:48] may every person make a place in their
[51:50] heart to receive the word today
[51:54] if it's just getting a little rid of a
[51:57] little self or
[51:59] a little pride or little ambition or
[52:02] something that isn't right
[52:04] lord let it be that
[52:07] everything gets moved aside so that
[52:09] there's room for christ in their life
[52:12] i pray lord for healing for those that
[52:14] are sick
[52:15] deliverance for your children lord
[52:18] that you cause the weary hands that hang
[52:21] down to be raised

[52:26] so that it reached the level of the
[52:27] promise
[52:29] that you'll cause your people lord to be
[52:31] what they're called believers

[52:44] listening in
[52:45] father we ask that you would bless them
[52:48] in a mighty way some of them have
[52:49] written
[52:50] expressing their
[52:52] anticipation for this service today
[52:54] they've already met in their local
[52:56] churches
[52:57] and now it's across the world and their
[53:00] time
[53:01] is evening time i pray lord that as the
[53:03] message goes forth
[53:05] you'll stir their hearts to believe
[53:07] and to receive from you
[53:09] now in jesus name we ask these things as
[53:13] we open up the word today open up our
[53:15] hearts to receive
[53:17] in jesus name amen
[53:19] amen god bless you
[53:21] if you'll turn with me to chapter mark
[53:23] chapter 4 we'll read from the 26th verse
[53:26] and then we'll let you be seated
[53:30] man what wonderful hours that we're
[53:32] living in if you give me a little more
[53:34] sound up here there's none
[53:37] mark chapter 4 verse 26
[53:40] and he said so is the kingdom of god as
[53:44] if a man should cast seed into the
[53:46] ground
[53:47] and should sleep and rise day night and
[53:50] day and the siege should spring and grow
[53:52] up
[53:53] he knoweth not how for the earth
[53:55] bringeth forth fruit of herself first
[53:58] the blade then the ear after that to
[54:02] full corn in the ear
[54:04] but when the fruit is brought forth
[54:07] immediately he putteth in the sickle
[54:10] because harvest is come
[54:13] amen may god bless you can be seated be
[54:16] turning with me to genesis chapter 17.
[54:19] as we just speak about that harvest has
[54:22] come i believe we are in a very
[54:25] wonderful hour where it is a harvest
[54:27] season
[54:29] we are seeing the
[54:31] um
[54:31] [Music]
[54:33] visions that have been spoken of for
[54:35] this hour come to fruition
[54:38] we um we
[54:40] know that already there's driverless
[54:42] cars and taxis in the streets of america
[54:46] we see a woman vice president
[54:49] that
[54:50] is in the high offices of
[54:52] of our country
[54:54] we also have a catholic president
[54:57] and so we have certainly
[55:00] behind him a beautiful but cruel woman
[55:03] pulling the strings in the white house
[55:05] and so we we see a gathering together as
[55:09] they
[55:10] as they um
[55:11] bind themselves together with
[55:13] the gold to
[55:15] stop climate change but i just got news
[55:19] for them the climate's going to change
[55:22] this world is going to burn with fire
[55:25] and so nothing nothing they can do can
[55:27] prevent that because they've sent away
[55:29] their day of grace
[55:31] and um the word of god is against them
[55:35] in the meantime we we've been told to
[55:37] watch russia
[55:39] watch russia keep our eyes on the king
[55:41] of the north
[55:43] and uh of course we are watching the
[55:45] world is watching everybody's eyes is on
[55:48] russia right now
[55:49] as she gathers up her cubs the old
[55:51] mother bear
[55:53] uh gathering up her cubs and
[55:56] forcing the rest of the world into a
[55:58] union
[56:00] and um and america of course is turned
[56:03] to speak as a dragon we've never heard
[56:05] her speak so devilish in her life
[56:08] as she comes against um religious
[56:11] freedoms and freedoms of all sorts
[56:14] um you know as she goes running over
[56:17] every everything we see an economy
[56:20] that's falling
[56:21] we see the world that is falling all
[56:23] around us in many many ways
[56:26] and um as it is happening of course
[56:29] russia's invading the ukraine
[56:33] and that now has caused israel to do a
[56:35] gathering
[56:37] and right now israel is gathering
[56:39] hundreds if not thousands of her
[56:42] of her jewish people gather those
[56:45] those last stragglers back
[56:47] to their promised land
[56:50] and that's not all of it but in this
[56:53] harvest time there's also a bride that
[56:55] is gathering
[56:57] a revival that is happening and i'm glad
[56:59] to be a part of that revival
[57:02] and and so we should possess to
[57:06] for our promises as the spirit of
[57:08] prophecy is among us
[57:11] wednesday night i'm sure you noticed i
[57:13] knew that the spirit of prophecy was
[57:15] here among us and
[57:17] and god speaking and revealing himself
[57:20] and we want to just continue to move on
[57:23] this into the things of god today and
[57:26] just look and see where we are in time
[57:29] now last sunday i was speaking or was
[57:31] trying to
[57:33] breach the subject on
[57:36] abraham coming to el shaddai
[57:39] and today we want to take that a little
[57:41] further so if you'll turn with me to
[57:43] genesis chapter 17
[57:45] i would like to read from there this
[57:47] morning
[57:48] and when abram was 90 years old and nine
[57:52] the lords appeared to abram and said
[57:54] unto him i am the almighty god
[57:57] walk before me and be thou perfect
[58:00] and i will make my covenant between me
[58:03] and thee and will multiply thee
[58:05] exceedingly
[58:07] and abram fell on his face and god
[58:09] talked with him saying
[58:11] as for me
[58:12] behold my covenant is with thee
[58:15] and thou shalt be a father of many
[58:18] nations
[58:19] neither shall thy name any more be
[58:22] called abram but
[58:23] thy name shall be abraham
[58:26] for father of many nations have i made
[58:29] thee
[58:30] and i will make the exceeding fruitful
[58:33] and i will make nations of these and
[58:36] kings shall come out of thee
[58:39] and i will establish my covenant between
[58:42] me and thee and thy seed after thee in
[58:45] their generations for
[58:47] an everlasting covenant to be a god unto
[58:50] thee and to thy seed after thee
[58:53] and i will give unto thee unto thy seed
[58:55] after thee the land wherein thou art a
[58:58] stranger
[58:59] and all the land of canaan
[59:02] for an everlasting possession and i will
[59:05] be
[59:07] their god
[59:09] and ame and god said to abraham thou
[59:12] shalt keep my covenant therefore thou
[59:15] and thy seed after thee in their
[59:17] generations
[59:18] this is my covenant which she shall keep
[59:20] between
[59:22] me and you and thy seed after thee
[59:25] every man
[59:26] child among you shall be circumcised and
[59:29] ye shall circumcise the flesh of your
[59:32] foreskin
[59:33] and it shall be a token
[59:36] of the covenant betwixt me and you
[59:39] and he that is eight days old shall be
[59:41] circumcised among you every man child in
[59:44] your generations
[59:46] and he that is born in the house are
[59:49] bought with money of any stranger which
[59:51] is not of
[59:52] that which is not of thy seed he that is
[59:55] born in thy house and he that is bought
[59:58] with thy money must needs be circumcised
[1:00:01] and my covenant shall be in your flesh
[1:00:03] for an everlasting covenant
[1:00:05] and the uncircumcised man-child whose
[1:00:09] flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised
[1:00:12] that soul shall be cut off from his
[1:00:14] people he hath broken my covenant and
[1:00:17] god said unto abraham as far as
[1:00:21] as for sarah thy wife thou shalt not
[1:00:24] call her name sarai
[1:00:26] but
[1:00:27] sarah shall her name be and i will bless
[1:00:30] her and give thee a son also of her yea
[1:00:33] i will bless her and she shall be a
[1:00:36] mother of nations and kings a people
[1:00:39] shall be of her
[1:00:40] then abraham fell on his face and
[1:00:42] laughed and said in his heart shall it
[1:00:44] shall be born unto him that is a hundred
[1:00:47] years old and shall sarah that is 90
[1:00:50] years old bear and abraham said unto god
[1:00:53] all that ismail might live before thee
[1:00:57] and god said
[1:00:58] sarah thy wife shall bear
[1:01:01] us thee a son indeed thou shalt call his
[1:01:03] name isaac
[1:01:05] and i will establish my covenant with
[1:01:07] him for an everlasting covenant and with
[1:01:10] his seed after him and as for ishmael i
[1:01:13] have heard thee behold i have blessed
[1:01:16] him and will make him fruitful and will
[1:01:18] multiply him exceedingly twelve princes
[1:01:21] shall he beget and i will make him a
[1:01:23] great nation
[1:01:25] but my covenant will i establish with
[1:01:27] isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee
[1:01:30] at this set time
[1:01:31] in the next year and he left off talking
[1:01:34] with him and god went up from abraham
[1:01:38] amen these are wonderful words that we
[1:01:41] have read today and
[1:01:44] sharing in this
[1:01:45] first of all we spoke of the church
[1:01:48] jesus did
[1:01:50] he
[1:01:50] compared it with
[1:01:52] with a wheat plant as it goes from
[1:01:55] from the grain back to the grain again
[1:01:58] and he said the kingdom of heaven will
[1:02:00] be like this
[1:02:02] then we would see that how that abraham
[1:02:05] brings it starts on his journey we took
[1:02:07] it last sunday we were dealing with
[1:02:10] justification and sanctification and the
[1:02:13] stations of abraham's
[1:02:15] life and his walk with god
[1:02:18] and remember it is a walk
[1:02:20] you know remember god called him to walk
[1:02:23] with him and that's the thing no matter
[1:02:25] where you are
[1:02:27] you must walk with him you cannot stay
[1:02:30] in one place
[1:02:32] and too many stay have stayed in one
[1:02:34] place way too long
[1:02:36] amen and but you know as as abraham
[1:02:40] would come to a place he would build an
[1:02:42] altar and dig a well and certainly
[1:02:45] perhaps you had worship there and you
[1:02:47] had revival there
[1:02:49] but it's time for you to make another
[1:02:51] step forward
[1:02:53] and you know the the assumption is that
[1:02:56] that once we
[1:02:57] lose that experience of that first
[1:03:00] meeting that joy that came with it that
[1:03:03] feeling of relief of sins forgiven
[1:03:07] it becomes stale and stagnant it's so
[1:03:10] that the flow becomes choked or blocked
[1:03:13] somehow
[1:03:14] and this is very common too common with
[1:03:17] too many christians
[1:03:19] you know there was a mountaintop
[1:03:20] experience a a period of the reality of
[1:03:24] christ it was unmistakable and and then
[1:03:28] there comes a slow drifting away
[1:03:30] and and then there was a brief moment of
[1:03:33] intense love and of joy and deep running
[1:03:37] peace and and a period of of wholeness
[1:03:41] when without straining you you found
[1:03:44] yourself patient and kind and gentle you
[1:03:47] see it was a time of believing
[1:03:49] and then a dull dryness takes over
[1:03:52] and and i just um you know as we think
[1:03:56] of that i i ponder really
[1:03:59] are christians or believers supposed to
[1:04:01] just live on a memory
[1:04:03] of what they experienced in the past
[1:04:06] you know memories fade and they become
[1:04:09] confused
[1:04:10] but contrary to that the holy ghost is
[1:04:13] is described as a river of living water
[1:04:17] and it doesn't come stale or stagnant
[1:04:20] it's a flowing stream
[1:04:23] and god was trying to bring abraham in
[1:04:25] his walk to a place where he met
[1:04:28] on el shaddai as a flowing stream as the
[1:04:33] as the god who
[1:04:35] supplied all his needs as the god who is
[1:04:39] more than enough
[1:04:41] that from him would supply
[1:04:43] nutrients and and a continual flow of
[1:04:47] goodness
[1:04:48] you know um
[1:04:49] you see
[1:04:50] in the early church there was always an
[1:04:53] excitement
[1:04:54] a stern of life in that early church
[1:04:57] and the church today by and large has
[1:05:00] has lost this
[1:05:02] many times we look around and we ask
[1:05:05] where are the changed lives and where
[1:05:08] where is a belief that men will die for
[1:05:11] those early believers in the book of
[1:05:13] acts they received their vitality from
[1:05:16] the spirit of god
[1:05:17] from an experience and that experience
[1:05:20] was called the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:05:23] and that's what else shady i is it's the
[1:05:25] place where in type that abraham was
[1:05:29] baptized with the holy ghost he meets el
[1:05:32] shaddai who is the breasted god we'll go
[1:05:35] into that a little more but from him
[1:05:37] came resources of life
[1:05:40] and it was an inexhaustible resource it
[1:05:43] wasn't a one-and-done thing it was there
[1:05:46] for every moment every hour for a daily
[1:05:49] walk for a continual consecration
[1:05:52] and so you see in that early church they
[1:05:55] went from glory to glory because on the
[1:05:57] day of pentecost they met the almighty
[1:06:00] god who empowered them with strength and
[1:06:04] change their name and gave them a seal
[1:06:06] of circumcision gave them a guarantee of
[1:06:10] the covenant within their own la their
[1:06:12] own set maybe others couldn't see it but
[1:06:15] they knew
[1:06:16] they had experienced it they had had it
[1:06:19] they knew the the pain of being
[1:06:21] separated from the world and from sin
[1:06:24] and the and and the the dying of the old
[1:06:27] man but they knew also the joy of being
[1:06:30] marked by god and by claimed by the holy
[1:06:34] ghost
[1:06:35] and so you see this is what happened on
[1:06:38] the day of pentecost it was that it was
[1:06:40] that grain of wheat it was that harvest
[1:06:44] season it was a time of renew of renewal
[1:06:48] where where it comes to
[1:06:50] fruition of every promise being
[1:06:53] manifested things that have been laying
[1:06:56] hidden in the scriptures now
[1:06:58] come to light as
[1:07:00] as even peter will preach and he'll pull
[1:07:04] out of joel's prophecy and say this is
[1:07:06] that
[1:07:07] he'll look back in other scriptures and
[1:07:09] he'll identify what god is doing because
[1:07:13] it's all now coming in a seed form
[1:07:16] but eventually through the successive
[1:07:19] years that followed the church began to
[1:07:22] drift
[1:07:23] it began to lose its first love
[1:07:25] and it would crumple into a backslidden
[1:07:28] church until it becomes so buried in era
[1:07:32] so in blatant falsehoods and formalisms
[1:07:37] and that original church then became
[1:07:40] like a buried seed that began to
[1:07:42] deteriorate and soon it was nothing like
[1:07:46] nothing like the original church
[1:07:48] and finally a fledgling leaf would
[1:07:51] struggle from the ground into the light
[1:07:54] and and of course that was luther and
[1:07:57] and as we brought with abraham the same
[1:08:00] thing that divine call to the promised
[1:08:03] land of the holy ghost was justification
[1:08:06] now justification is an act of god
[1:08:09] whereby he pronounces a sinner to be
[1:08:12] righteous because of that sinner's faith
[1:08:15] in christ
[1:08:17] justification is a release from sin
[1:08:21] and though it is not the baptism of the
[1:08:23] holy ghost it is an experience of the
[1:08:26] holy ghost
[1:08:28] amen justification does come by the
[1:08:31] spirit of god
[1:08:32] justification per se does not make
[1:08:35] anybody holy
[1:08:37] it simply declares him as not guilty
[1:08:40] before god and therefore he is treated
[1:08:42] as holy the actual change toward
[1:08:45] holiness in the center occurs in
[1:08:48] sanctification
[1:08:49] it is like brother branham would use the
[1:08:52] the
[1:08:53] illustration of a cup that he would find
[1:08:56] in a chicken pin he would pick it up and
[1:08:58] he said it's a good cup
[1:09:01] you know it may be even mama's best
[1:09:03] china
[1:09:04] it's a good cup
[1:09:07] there's nothing wrong with the cup it's
[1:09:09] dirty
[1:09:10] it's filthy you see justification picks
[1:09:13] you up
[1:09:14] and man he picked you up and identified
[1:09:17] you
[1:09:18] and it said you are your good cup
[1:09:22] amen and and you're i'm going to justify
[1:09:26] you're justified you could be used in
[1:09:29] mama's kitchen again
[1:09:31] but you see you're dirty so you need
[1:09:33] sanctifying
[1:09:35] so with the bleach and the cleansing and
[1:09:37] the washing and the purging and whatever
[1:09:40] you had to do to clean it up you rest
[1:09:42] you restore it and you set it in mama's
[1:09:45] in mama's kitchen right but you see it's
[1:09:49] now sanctified and set
[1:09:52] apart for service
[1:09:54] but that's not the end of the cut the
[1:09:57] cup will be filled
[1:10:00] amen and put into the master use
[1:10:03] are you with me that's the baptism of
[1:10:05] the holy ghost to be filled with him
[1:10:09] now
[1:10:10] of course as you know
[1:10:12] i it's like playing the the game of
[1:10:15] baseball you can't skip a base
[1:10:19] you can't jump from justification and
[1:10:21] then get filled with the holy ghost
[1:10:25] they account it don't happen
[1:10:26] you have to be sanctified
[1:10:29] amen in the days of of wesley the church
[1:10:33] advanced from a justified state to a
[1:10:36] sanctified state
[1:10:38] now to sanctify something is to set it
[1:10:40] apart for special use
[1:10:43] to sanctify a person is to make him holy
[1:10:46] now brother branham would tell us in the
[1:10:48] message that countdown he would tell us
[1:10:51] these experiences were real
[1:10:54] let me let me just go and cap them over
[1:10:57] for a minute by this quote he said i
[1:10:59] want you to remember
[1:11:00] that the church called church is not the
[1:11:03] church the church is the church
[1:11:05] spiritual
[1:11:06] and ten thousand times ten thousands of
[1:11:09] lutherans that joined the church knew no
[1:11:11] more about justification than a hog knew
[1:11:14] about a side saddle
[1:11:16] they knew nothing of it and in the
[1:11:18] wesley age how tens of thousands profess
[1:11:20] sanctification they knew nothing more
[1:11:23] about the sanctification power of god
[1:11:26] and a rabbit does about snowshoes they
[1:11:28] absolutely didn't know it
[1:11:30] but there was a people who achieved it
[1:11:34] i want you to get this in mind even
[1:11:36] though you look and you see failures
[1:11:38] there's somebody going to achieve it
[1:11:42] amen he said now you see where i'm
[1:11:44] getting to there was somebody who knew
[1:11:46] what justified meant in the sight of god
[1:11:49] having peace with god through our lord
[1:11:51] jesus christ there was some of those
[1:11:54] lutherans who were loyal they believed
[1:11:56] it no matter what the catholic church
[1:11:58] said they believed god's word they stood
[1:12:00] on it because the messenger that is
[1:12:03] preached the just shall live by faith
[1:12:06] and they believed in a justified state
[1:12:09] and they were able by the grace of god
[1:12:11] to achieve justification having peace
[1:12:14] with god to our lord jesus christ and
[1:12:17] then along came the methodists with
[1:12:20] sanctification there was many of those
[1:12:22] methodists were actually sanctified now
[1:12:25] a lot of them claimed they claimed it
[1:12:28] and knew nothing about it the methodist
[1:12:30] church taught sanctification they they
[1:12:33] said they got down and they cried and
[1:12:35] they got back up and said glory to god
[1:12:37] i'm sanctified and they went right on
[1:12:39] living like they always did but some of
[1:12:41] those men and women was actually
[1:12:44] sanctified from the things of the world
[1:12:47] and lived a consecrated set apart life
[1:12:52] now you see
[1:12:54] those would be the bride of that age
[1:12:57] there would be those who will come up in
[1:12:59] the great resurrection and be
[1:13:01] resurrected and go in the rapture with
[1:13:04] us
[1:13:05] now they're because they are people who
[1:13:08] had a real experience with god
[1:13:11] now through the experience of
[1:13:13] sanctification the the wheat plant was
[1:13:16] moving back toward the original grain
[1:13:19] and wesley became like the tassel it was
[1:13:22] a pollination age and the gospel would
[1:13:24] spread worldwide and missionary
[1:13:27] societies would raise up and and bible
[1:13:30] societies and and and the gospel would
[1:13:33] be spread everywhere it was the pollen
[1:13:35] age
[1:13:36] now you see in your walk with god you
[1:13:40] cannot bypass sanctification
[1:13:43] you must be cleansed and die up to your
[1:13:46] bad habits
[1:13:49] out to the world
[1:13:50] now and this is what brother branham
[1:13:52] told us in countdown he said if a man
[1:13:55] sets a thought on just justification in
[1:13:57] other words believing on the lord
[1:14:00] or just receiving the message
[1:14:04] or just saying god sent a prophet
[1:14:07] or i believe a certain theology
[1:14:10] or certain aspects of the doctrines of
[1:14:12] the message
[1:14:14] that's all you got to have he's wrong he
[1:14:16] said if a man sits on the thought of
[1:14:18] just justification is all you got to
[1:14:20] have he's wrong
[1:14:22] he's got to be wrong and if the church
[1:14:25] believes like many of the pentecostals
[1:14:27] he talked about the full gospel
[1:14:29] charismatic that the holy ghost is it
[1:14:32] that's just repent and get the holy
[1:14:34] ghost that's wrong because you got to
[1:14:37] get sanctification in there to cleanse
[1:14:40] before the holy ghost comes in if you
[1:14:42] don't you leave out the blood
[1:14:44] so again again this would be the issue
[1:14:48] that we would face as there would be
[1:14:51] millions
[1:14:53] millions of people added to uh to the
[1:14:57] the church that would be how they
[1:15:00] have a um an experience of what they
[1:15:02] call baptism in the holy ghost and they
[1:15:05] would do it and not even be sanctified
[1:15:09] they would do it and not and not even
[1:15:11] their lives changed
[1:15:13] they would speak in tongues and have a
[1:15:15] gift to the spirit without having the
[1:15:17] spirit
[1:15:20] now originally though the original
[1:15:23] movement at azusa street they all
[1:15:26] believed in the sanctified life
[1:15:29] they did not bypass sanctification they
[1:15:31] believed in holiness that was their
[1:15:33] roots
[1:15:34] they all came from the holiness movement
[1:15:37] women didn't cut their hair
[1:15:39] men didn't follow hippie fats
[1:15:42] but you know the war came and and the
[1:15:45] women went to the factories
[1:15:47] and while while the men were at war
[1:15:49] and for some their uniforms would
[1:15:51] require pants
[1:15:53] and cross dressing began to be popular
[1:15:56] it began to be accepted as a as a you
[1:15:59] know
[1:16:00] i mean today people look and they still
[1:16:02] kind of frown on a man cross-dressing
[1:16:05] but women do it all the time
[1:16:08] and man but cross-dressing began to be
[1:16:10] popular
[1:16:12] certain women were wearing pants to
[1:16:13] everything but but formal events
[1:16:17] and
[1:16:17] you know there again um they they begin
[1:16:21] to
[1:16:22] um
[1:16:23] they didn't go they didn't wear them to
[1:16:25] church
[1:16:26] and among the pentecostal churches like
[1:16:28] the assembly of god and other trinity
[1:16:30] pentecostal churches they began to
[1:16:32] embrace a new doctrine and it was called
[1:16:35] women's liberation
[1:16:38] and the women's liberation as they
[1:16:40] embraced it they shed their holiness
[1:16:44] beliefs
[1:16:45] and the women began to cut their hair
[1:16:47] and paint their face and cross-dress
[1:16:49] wearing men's apparel taking man's
[1:16:52] position and the traditional family was
[1:16:55] gone from the pentecostal churches
[1:16:58] all the while still claiming to receive
[1:17:01] the holy ghost
[1:17:03] because he spoke in tongues
[1:17:05] because he had a gift from the spirit
[1:17:08] and not the spirit himself
[1:17:11] the spirit of god leads you into
[1:17:13] sanctification
[1:17:15] now a modern device called television
[1:17:18] crept into people's homes and and it
[1:17:20] made sin absolutely beautiful and
[1:17:23] glamorous
[1:17:25] you know it made it oh it was the trick
[1:17:28] thing to do is the popular thing to do
[1:17:31] as brother branham has said the devil
[1:17:33] landed here a few years ago and with his
[1:17:36] great army and hit in hollywood
[1:17:38] california and he's invaded the united
[1:17:41] states with his demon powers and
[1:17:44] and it gave them all one mind you
[1:17:47] remember this is the working of the
[1:17:49] beast
[1:17:50] to give them all one mind where they all
[1:17:53] think alike
[1:17:56] and so it has happened that that that it
[1:17:59] has changed the thinking
[1:18:01] of the other christians even today
[1:18:04] where and and look back and we can see
[1:18:07] programs that we can look back on as now
[1:18:09] is something that looks very innocent
[1:18:12] like i love lucy they were
[1:18:15] they
[1:18:16] they were among the first though that
[1:18:18] mocked and belittled the housewife and
[1:18:21] before you know it traditional marriage
[1:18:24] and traditional families were mocked and
[1:18:26] scorned and soon people had one mind
[1:18:30] from that one vision of hell
[1:18:33] and hollywood stars were
[1:18:35] that hollywood stars were patterned
[1:18:38] after they patterned after an
[1:18:39] inspiration from hell
[1:18:43] and and they and and now
[1:18:46] again in the churches they begin to
[1:18:49] pattern after that vision
[1:18:52] and they patterned their dress they wore
[1:18:55] their makeup to look like them
[1:18:57] and as early as 1954 brother branham
[1:19:00] when he's preaching on abraham he talks
[1:19:03] about how abraham strayed from the
[1:19:05] promised land and he said so at the
[1:19:08] church until the church had become
[1:19:11] backslidden
[1:19:12] and and so
[1:19:14] they were so backslidden until even the
[1:19:17] baptist whose doctrine was founded on
[1:19:20] justification by faith in christ
[1:19:22] backslid over eternal security that were
[1:19:26] once saved always saved
[1:19:29] you know there was
[1:19:31] there is a true there is a true eternal
[1:19:34] security where once you're truly filled
[1:19:36] with the holy ghost you're sealed to the
[1:19:38] day of redemption you are sealed in with
[1:19:42] christ and the devil is sealed out
[1:19:45] so there is a truth to eternal security
[1:19:48] but they took eternal security to of
[1:19:52] once saved always saved to the extreme
[1:19:55] and begin to look at sin as though it
[1:19:59] didn't matter it was something you know
[1:20:01] everybody has
[1:20:03] that we can overcome it's just frivolous
[1:20:06] you know it didn't matter what you do
[1:20:08] because you confess jesus as your savior
[1:20:12] so it don't make any difference how you
[1:20:14] live make no difference how you dress
[1:20:16] god doesn't look on the outside god
[1:20:19] looks on the inside
[1:20:20] and so
[1:20:22] you know they they would say that
[1:20:24] doesn't make any difference to me
[1:20:26] about sin a little beer in the
[1:20:28] refrigerator a little cocktail with the
[1:20:31] boss a little uh
[1:20:33] extra kiss with the secretary a little
[1:20:36] bit you know married two or three four
[1:20:38] times that doesn't really matter god
[1:20:40] looks on the heart
[1:20:41] and i'm justified i accept him as savior
[1:20:45] and so they begin to believe that they
[1:20:47] were saved in their sins not from their
[1:20:50] sins
[1:20:51] and so again when if you're really truly
[1:20:54] saved you don't want to do those things
[1:20:57] you see sin desire has to be dealt with
[1:21:01] or you cannot be truly saved
[1:21:05] now so the baptist would lose their
[1:21:07] holiness
[1:21:08] those people wouldn't go to dances they
[1:21:11] used to maybe trim their hair but they
[1:21:14] wouldn't bob it
[1:21:15] women wore skirts too and especially to
[1:21:18] church
[1:21:19] and they became so secure in believing
[1:21:21] once they'd always say
[1:21:23] i had a baptist man tell me as he lift
[1:21:26] one cigarette off of another he was
[1:21:28] divorced twice and was contemplating the
[1:21:31] third marriage and a few weeks before
[1:21:33] he'd been arrested for drunk driving and
[1:21:36] and and he he was um he was saying you
[1:21:40] know brother tim i am sure of my
[1:21:42] salvation if the rapture would happen
[1:21:45] this minute i know i would go up to meet
[1:21:48] the lord i'm anticipating to come in the
[1:21:51] lord any day
[1:21:53] now
[1:21:54] so sure was he
[1:21:57] of his justification
[1:22:01] that his sins were forgiven
[1:22:04] that he was he was convinced he was
[1:22:07] ready to meet god that moment and needed
[1:22:12] nothing further
[1:22:16] now you see
[1:22:18] the christian church begin to look more
[1:22:20] like the world
[1:22:22] dressing like the world losing his holy
[1:22:25] life you you often wonder why did
[1:22:27] brother branham's constantly strike out
[1:22:30] against it it was where the church was
[1:22:32] going and he was he was hollering and
[1:22:35] screaming to them don't go over that
[1:22:37] waterfall
[1:22:38] turn around before it's too late he was
[1:22:41] trying to get them to repent and to come
[1:22:43] back to god and finally he couldn't get
[1:22:46] him to repent so he said get out of that
[1:22:48] boat come out of her my people
[1:22:53] amen that's going over into the
[1:22:55] tribulation
[1:22:56] that's going to seek out yonder
[1:22:58] somewhere get out of it while you got a
[1:23:00] chance and flee to the ark of safety get
[1:23:03] into jesus christ
[1:23:06] now
[1:23:08] all of them
[1:23:09] the baptist methodists
[1:23:11] the pentecostal the feminist movement
[1:23:14] affected the church
[1:23:16] even the pentecostal the liberation of
[1:23:18] women had begun they were removing this
[1:23:20] what they thought was shackles and
[1:23:23] chains of holiness
[1:23:25] and this just transformed the women
[1:23:28] thrusting them into a modern feminist
[1:23:31] move
[1:23:32] and soon ever spread
[1:23:34] of a holy dress and every a holy look
[1:23:37] was totally gone from them
[1:23:40] and brother branham was constantly
[1:23:42] crying out against it
[1:23:44] you wonder sometimes why he would be so
[1:23:47] hard you know why it was he saw where
[1:23:50] the church was going
[1:23:52] and and he saw that they were bypassing
[1:23:55] the very works of sanctification as he
[1:23:59] as he said on an unconditional covenant
[1:24:01] those things such as bob are dancing and
[1:24:04] and card parties and and playing and
[1:24:07] bobbing your hair and painting your lips
[1:24:10] and manicure in your face and all that
[1:24:12] thing is the attributes of unbelief
[1:24:15] and that hurts pentecost but that's
[1:24:17] what's good for your brother that's
[1:24:18] right couldn't walk the old narrow path
[1:24:21] just like a hog going to swallow a dog
[1:24:23] to its vomit and there's where the
[1:24:25] pentecostal churches return oh you don't
[1:24:28] hear very many amen but i tell you
[1:24:29] brother it's the honest and good truth
[1:24:32] you see they they were rejecting that
[1:24:35] they were turning them around here he
[1:24:37] was a voice of warning the voice of god
[1:24:40] speaking out in that day and time that
[1:24:43] the whole world matters
[1:24:47] every word matters man shall live by
[1:24:50] every word not just some of it but every
[1:24:53] word and it all matters
[1:24:58] he said what the trouble of it is the
[1:24:59] devil landed up here in hollywood and
[1:25:01] come through television stripped off our
[1:25:03] women and done everything that was and
[1:25:05] ungodly to be done and and people call
[1:25:08] it all right
[1:25:09] and here come your ladder rain
[1:25:11] scattering or whatever it was and
[1:25:13] actually it was the full gospel move
[1:25:15] calling themselves a letter ring and and
[1:25:18] that became the big charismatic move
[1:25:21] called liberation of women and
[1:25:23] everything like that and he said it's a
[1:25:24] disgrace it's the works of the devil you
[1:25:28] ain't going to love me after the night
[1:25:29] brother but when i meet you at the
[1:25:31] judgment bar i'll be clean of the thing
[1:25:33] and that's one thing sure i'm going to
[1:25:35] tell you the truth about it
[1:25:37] amen the word amen means so be it
[1:25:40] and that's why brother branham preached
[1:25:42] so hard against cutting hair what the
[1:25:45] bible says about it
[1:25:47] amen this is what the bible said the
[1:25:49] pain in the face he used example of
[1:25:52] jezebel and and vamping men and the
[1:25:55] whole sexual revolution that began
[1:25:58] and then the cross-dressing
[1:26:01] which was a spirit of perversion that
[1:26:04] grew from out of that until men don't
[1:26:06] even know how to be a man anymore
[1:26:11] now so yet they still spoke in tongues
[1:26:14] and prophesied
[1:26:16] they were still claiming the holy ghost
[1:26:19] and receiving the baptism without
[1:26:22] sanctification
[1:26:26] now as he said there's this great
[1:26:28] doctrine among the pentecostal people of
[1:26:30] the liberation of women they're wearing
[1:26:32] great long earrings
[1:26:34] and doing all kinds of dressings
[1:26:37] a young fella sat in front of my house a
[1:26:39] few days ago in a little truck
[1:26:41] crying that his wife pentecostal speaks
[1:26:43] with tongues gives prophecy and said the
[1:26:46] whole church wears shorts and she goes
[1:26:49] right on
[1:26:50] the street at eight or nine o'clock at
[1:26:52] night picking up little cigarette stumps
[1:26:54] that others have thrown away and smoking
[1:26:56] and still shouting praising the lord and
[1:26:58] giving prophecies
[1:27:02] now prophecies and tones
[1:27:05] are gifts of the holy spirit
[1:27:09] they are not the holy spirit
[1:27:13] now so here was the church now
[1:27:17] again they had stopped
[1:27:19] at justification all the way trying to
[1:27:22] claim
[1:27:25] the holy ghost
[1:27:27] but instead of getting the holy ghost
[1:27:28] and we'll get into our lesson this
[1:27:30] morning they took the breath of
[1:27:32] denomination instead
[1:27:35] a dogma that if you speak in tongues
[1:27:37] that you got the holy ghost
[1:27:41] now
[1:27:42] so again
[1:27:43] but abraham
[1:27:44] was led by god he went through and as
[1:27:47] we've been to it the the uh
[1:27:50] where the divine call to the altar age
[1:27:53] now we're coming to the age of the holy
[1:27:55] ghost
[1:27:56] genesis 17 1.
[1:27:58] i did that for a little background now
[1:28:08] and when abram was 90 years old and nine
[1:28:13] the lord appeared to abram and said in
[1:28:15] him i am almighty god this word is el
[1:28:19] shaddai
[1:28:22] wall before me and be thou perfect
[1:28:25] now this word almighty god el shaddai in
[1:28:29] the hebrew
[1:28:30] it comes from a root word shed
[1:28:34] and that word shad means breast
[1:28:38] so there
[1:28:40] there there again is is
[1:28:43] we're seeing a son of abraham that had
[1:28:46] already come from abraham
[1:28:48] but it came from abraham's strength that
[1:28:51] was ishmael
[1:28:52] but now there is a promise given that
[1:28:56] there will be one born of the
[1:28:58] supernatural
[1:29:00] and to be born of the supernatural is to
[1:29:03] be born of the word
[1:29:06] now the full word had not yet come there
[1:29:10] was parts of the words revealed
[1:29:12] justification
[1:29:14] more light revealed sanctification now
[1:29:17] gifts of the spirit were being light was
[1:29:19] shown on them and a baptism as they
[1:29:22] called it in the holy ghost
[1:29:24] but again you know the full word had not
[1:29:28] yet come
[1:29:29] there were mysteries that were not yet
[1:29:31] revealed
[1:29:32] there were truths that were not yet
[1:29:34] given
[1:29:35] but brother branham tells us at the
[1:29:37] opening of the seven seals revelation 10
[1:29:41] the full word
[1:29:43] is to be born in the manifestation again
[1:29:46] and vindicated by the spirit of god in
[1:29:49] full strength i want you to get some of
[1:29:51] these points
[1:29:52] the full word is to be born
[1:29:55] into manifestation
[1:29:58] and it will be in its full strength
[1:30:01] amen as it was when it was here on earth
[1:30:04] manifesting the same way doing the same
[1:30:07] things it did when it was here on earth
[1:30:09] amen hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same
[1:30:12] yesterday today and forever luke 17 30
[1:30:15] jesus said in the days the last days as
[1:30:18] it was in the days of sodom when the son
[1:30:21] of man that's the word will be revealing
[1:30:23] himself again it'll be the same thing
[1:30:26] so now there's a promise that god would
[1:30:29] reveal himself in his fullness
[1:30:33] that the full word would come
[1:30:37] now the full word would come so that
[1:30:39] there could be
[1:30:41] of a child born of and by that word
[1:30:48] i'm trying to make this plain to you
[1:30:50] today
[1:30:50] that this message produces a birth
[1:30:55] and it is a word birth
[1:30:59] now brother branham told us in birth
[1:31:02] pains he said we're in the laodicean
[1:31:05] church age
[1:31:06] and her messenger is promised in malachi
[1:31:09] the fourth chapter he promised to do it
[1:31:11] the message is to bring back the word
[1:31:14] bring the people back to the word
[1:31:16] birth to be she is to be delivered of a
[1:31:19] new birth according to
[1:31:22] malachi 4.
[1:31:25] so we we've had
[1:31:27] you know wesley or luther with
[1:31:29] [Applause]
[1:31:31] what he called a new birth
[1:31:33] which was justification and
[1:31:35] sanctification would come and now that
[1:31:37] the gifts would come but brother branham
[1:31:39] tells us
[1:31:40] that there is to be a people
[1:31:43] that it comes of a new birth
[1:31:47] of malachi 4
[1:31:50] and malachi 4 used to restore the hearts
[1:31:53] of the children back to the original
[1:31:56] apostolic fathers
[1:31:58] so again there would be a people
[1:32:00] restored back and have the same kind of
[1:32:04] birth that they did on the day of
[1:32:06] pentecost
[1:32:09] now he says in birth pains the word must
[1:32:12] deliver the word bride church
[1:32:15] the church has got to be delivered out
[1:32:17] of her a bride for christ
[1:32:21] she's fixing to bring forth the perfect
[1:32:23] word back there and the word is coming
[1:32:27] for the word bride
[1:32:29] as a woman is a part of a man taken from
[1:32:33] him so the church will have to be a word
[1:32:35] abiding church every word of the bible
[1:32:39] not systems dogmas nothing added to it
[1:32:42] it'll have to be in an unadulterated
[1:32:46] pure virgin word
[1:32:49] so again the word he said is going to
[1:32:52] give birth to a word
[1:32:55] pride
[1:32:57] the message is coming is going to give
[1:33:00] birth there's a new birth of malachi 4
[1:33:04] and it is the same birth that they had
[1:33:07] back in the beginning
[1:33:10] now god of this evil age word bride
[1:33:13] heading up in the person of the word of
[1:33:15] god made manifest in the evil age we're
[1:33:18] living
[1:33:19] so this bride will be the person of the
[1:33:21] word made manifested
[1:33:24] manifesting all the word every promise
[1:33:28] every gift
[1:33:29] his righteousness his holiness without
[1:33:32] which no man can see the lord
[1:33:35] a child of the supernatural was promised
[1:33:39] you notice this
[1:33:41] god is promising here without shadow i'm
[1:33:44] going to give you a child
[1:33:47] and it this one your body is now dead
[1:33:50] you can't do this on your own
[1:33:53] this is going to be without works
[1:33:56] without human effort
[1:33:58] it won't be something worked up
[1:34:01] it won't be something imagined it won't
[1:34:03] come by shaking the preacher's hand or
[1:34:06] joining a church it will be an
[1:34:08] absolutely supernatural birth
[1:34:13] but you notice
[1:34:14] before this could happen
[1:34:16] and the promised son came
[1:34:19] because of sarah's unbelief they got
[1:34:21] ahead of the promise
[1:34:23] and abraham had a son of his own flesh
[1:34:26] born of a bombs woman
[1:34:29] and not of the free woman
[1:34:34] ismail was abraham's fleshly strength
[1:34:37] why isaac could have come only through
[1:34:39] the supernatural because
[1:34:41] sarah was now 90.
[1:34:43] abraham a hundred
[1:34:45] god would have to restore their bodies
[1:34:48] and and heal sarah of her barrenness
[1:34:52] what was god doing god was prophesying
[1:34:55] portraying through them foreshadowing
[1:34:58] through their lives
[1:35:00] that what he would do at the end time
[1:35:03] that he would change the body of the
[1:35:05] living church and resurrect the dead in
[1:35:08] christ
[1:35:09] in order to bring forth the long-awaited
[1:35:12] promised son but before he could come
[1:35:15] there would have to be a bride born out
[1:35:17] of that word to present to him
[1:35:20] and abraham was used to show us that the
[1:35:22] promised son would be born of the
[1:35:25] supernatural
[1:35:27] and not a man's strength
[1:35:30] turn with me to genesis 16 and verse 2
[1:35:33] and sarah said unto abram behold now the
[1:35:36] lord has restrained me from barren
[1:35:39] now she's going to blame god i'm not
[1:35:41] able to do it god didn't make provisions
[1:35:45] i pray thee go in unto my maid that it
[1:35:47] may be that i may obtain children by her
[1:35:49] and abram abram hearken to the voice of
[1:35:52] sarai
[1:35:54] now through disbelieving the promise of
[1:35:57] god
[1:35:57] was for her
[1:35:59] sarah i decided to help god out a little
[1:36:02] bit
[1:36:05] by offering
[1:36:06] a denomination a bounce woman
[1:36:10] to bring forth christ
[1:36:14] now that's what men have done they have
[1:36:16] wanted to help god out
[1:36:19] do it by human efforts instead of by the
[1:36:22] supernatural
[1:36:24] now instead of coming to know god
[1:36:26] personally by an experience of
[1:36:28] justification it was changing shaking
[1:36:31] hands with the preacher
[1:36:34] making intellectual confession of faith
[1:36:36] and joining a church and outward
[1:36:39] baptisms and works and human efforts
[1:36:44] again with sanctification instead of
[1:36:46] coming to know god personally by an
[1:36:48] experience of sanctification it became
[1:36:51] self-righteous
[1:36:53] manufactured holiness
[1:36:56] instead of coming to god know him
[1:36:58] personally by an experience of the
[1:37:01] baptism of the holy ghost pentecost the
[1:37:04] associate movement they substituted
[1:37:07] speaking in tongues
[1:37:09] and many times this was something
[1:37:12] manufactured
[1:37:15] a confusion of language
[1:37:19] just a senseless jabber
[1:37:23] now ishmael was something abraham could
[1:37:26] produce by his own strength
[1:37:29] that's the pentecostal age
[1:37:31] this is where the real twin comes into
[1:37:34] view
[1:37:35] because he would come the supernatural
[1:37:37] as the word was coming into view for
[1:37:40] people to be be born with
[1:37:42] and let me just say it a little
[1:37:44] differently this layout of cnh is the
[1:37:47] age of pentecost this age of pentecost
[1:37:49] would also be the harvest age
[1:37:52] where the church returns to what it was
[1:37:54] in the book of acts
[1:37:56] but before the grain could come
[1:37:59] there's another stage called the shock
[1:38:03] now the shuck is the stage of the grain
[1:38:06] that
[1:38:07] it is a twin
[1:38:09] to the grain itself
[1:38:12] it looks like original grain it can be
[1:38:14] mistaken
[1:38:16] four million for original grain
[1:38:18] but it is not the grain
[1:38:22] and and because the true grain is where
[1:38:25] the bride returns
[1:38:27] to the bride she was at pentecost
[1:38:30] and azusa street fell short of that
[1:38:35] now like ishmael looked like and he was
[1:38:37] accepted as a fulfillment of the promise
[1:38:40] but he was not the fulfillment of the
[1:38:42] promise he was only the shock
[1:38:45] that came before the grave
[1:38:48] now god promises the greater wheat that
[1:38:50] he planted at pentecost in the book of
[1:38:52] acts would return back to grain again
[1:38:57] now these other stages of the wheat
[1:38:59] plant that we read about from jesus own
[1:39:01] word of the blade and the toss on the
[1:39:03] shelf they were not the promised
[1:39:05] restoration
[1:39:07] even as ishmael was not the promised son
[1:39:10] neither was the souza street pentecostal
[1:39:13] the restoration of pentecost
[1:39:16] they were called pentecost like ishmael
[1:39:19] was called abraham's seed
[1:39:22] but he was not of the promise he was not
[1:39:24] the one that god was bringing a rapture
[1:39:28] for
[1:39:29] are you with me now so again in the
[1:39:32] exposition of the church age she said
[1:39:34] the lutheran age did not restore the
[1:39:36] church it started a reformation
[1:39:39] the western age did not restore
[1:39:43] then then this then speaking of the
[1:39:45] azusa's movement he says the pentecostal
[1:39:47] age did not restore
[1:39:49] but god has to restore for he cannot
[1:39:52] deny his word i i want to get this to
[1:39:54] you god still has to do what he said
[1:39:59] even though we got an ishmael
[1:40:02] even though we got an abraham seed and
[1:40:04] some would say well just let let him be
[1:40:07] the one let him you know let let him
[1:40:09] live before you i'll bless him
[1:40:13] but he's not what i'm after
[1:40:16] i'm after one that's going to come by
[1:40:18] the supernatural
[1:40:20] and it's going to be by you drinking
[1:40:22] from el shaddai
[1:40:25] it's you going to take the promises of
[1:40:28] the world
[1:40:29] and these words there are going to be
[1:40:31] made manifest in a bribe people
[1:40:35] listen here he said
[1:40:37] he said that
[1:40:38] god has to restore because he cannot
[1:40:41] deny his word god will take the church
[1:40:45] right back to pentecost of the beginning
[1:40:49] so no matter what anybody says
[1:40:52] what how many ishmaels are there how
[1:40:54] many wild offsprings that are there amen
[1:40:57] how many that shout and didn't get it
[1:40:59] how many that believed and didn't get it
[1:41:02] how many to speak in tongues and didn't
[1:41:04] get it god is going to bring a people
[1:41:08] amen back to pentecost of the beginning
[1:41:12] the word will give birth
[1:41:16] amen and it'll be a word birth
[1:41:19] just like it was on the day of pentecost
[1:41:24] now in jehovah jair brother bradham
[1:41:26] explains this and i'm going to read this
[1:41:28] in its entirety here he said we'll
[1:41:30] finish
[1:41:31] this but he said the covenant has to be
[1:41:34] confirmed with the royal seed of abraham
[1:41:37] which are the people out of the gentile
[1:41:39] not jews the people of the gentiles for
[1:41:41] his namesake taking it for his name
[1:41:45] the church that's got his name
[1:41:48] will come back into him because that who
[1:41:51] she is her life
[1:41:54] listen when the holy ghost fell on the
[1:41:56] day of pentecost the life was given to
[1:41:59] the church and that church went right
[1:42:01] out and produced they wrote a book
[1:42:03] behind that church a book of acts and
[1:42:05] what it did because it was as christ in
[1:42:08] the apostles now jesus said in john
[1:42:11] 15 i am the vine you're the branches and
[1:42:14] the vine does not bear fruit the branch
[1:42:18] bears the fruit it is energized by the
[1:42:20] vine
[1:42:21] well now if that limb first one come out
[1:42:25] on that tree produced a book of acts if
[1:42:28] it ever puts out another limb it'll be
[1:42:31] the same life
[1:42:33] and he uses example of what he saw at
[1:42:35] john sheriff's farm where he took him
[1:42:38] into his citrus grove and he showed him
[1:42:40] a tree that he was experimenting with
[1:42:44] and it was an orange tree and had
[1:42:46] oranges and lemons and grapefruits and
[1:42:50] tangerines and tangelos about nine or
[1:42:53] ten different fruits
[1:42:55] and brother brandon asked him what kind
[1:42:57] of fruit this tree is at
[1:42:58] and he said oh this is my experiment
[1:43:01] and he said but it's an orange tree
[1:43:04] he said well what are all these other
[1:43:06] fruits doing on there he said well i
[1:43:08] drafted on there and he said um said so
[1:43:13] next year when it blossoms and brings
[1:43:15] forth fruit then this that is bearing
[1:43:18] lemons here will bear oranges right and
[1:43:20] he said no
[1:43:22] it won't bear oranges it'll bear lemons
[1:43:26] and he says oh well
[1:43:28] you know
[1:43:29] it's coming out of an orange tree i
[1:43:31] don't see how i can do it he said well
[1:43:33] because it's been grafted in
[1:43:35] and it's uh it's nature is lemon
[1:43:38] and he said you know but what what about
[1:43:41] it he said if that tree puts forth a
[1:43:44] branch of its own he said it'll bear
[1:43:47] oranges
[1:43:49] just like the original root wasps
[1:43:54] now he said oh brother that when the
[1:43:56] holy spirit come up onto that vine a
[1:43:59] producer is fine the first branch they
[1:44:01] wrote a book of acts behind it
[1:44:04] is that tree ever puts forth another
[1:44:06] original limb
[1:44:08] if that tree
[1:44:09] it'll throw the same thing it'll be
[1:44:12] jesus christ now we've got methodist
[1:44:14] presbyterian baptist lutheran everything
[1:44:17] else was grafted into it barren
[1:44:19] denominational fruit but if it ever puts
[1:44:21] forth another branch she will be a
[1:44:24] genuine
[1:44:25] christ-filled
[1:44:27] christ-centered
[1:44:28] word of god
[1:44:31] amen that's what the bride used to be a
[1:44:34] man genuine
[1:44:35] christ-filled
[1:44:37] christ-centered
[1:44:39] word of god
[1:44:40] amen then he talks about the the bride
[1:44:43] tree and this message on that and he
[1:44:45] said well what the palmer when he ate
[1:44:47] the cankerworm you know
[1:44:49] what one left the other and eight and
[1:44:52] and he said until the whole thing was
[1:44:54] eaten down the method is eight and the
[1:44:56] baptism eight and they each took their
[1:44:57] part and the whole thing is cut down but
[1:45:00] that's not the end of the tree
[1:45:03] the word says i
[1:45:05] will restore
[1:45:07] saith the lord
[1:45:09] hallelujah all the years i will send
[1:45:11] back another church i'm quoting now i'll
[1:45:14] send back another church in the last
[1:45:16] days
[1:45:18] hallelujah amen i will restore that
[1:45:21] original power again
[1:45:24] in the evening time it shall be light
[1:45:27] down in the heart of the tree no matter
[1:45:29] how many branches have been pruned that
[1:45:31] will come forth the royal seed of
[1:45:34] abraham
[1:45:36] god promised that he would do it i will
[1:45:38] restore all the years denominations say
[1:45:41] i will restore all the years i prune the
[1:45:43] thing off but yet there will come a vine
[1:45:46] or a branch out of the heart of it
[1:45:49] and that branch he said will be like a
[1:45:51] tree planted by the rivers of water
[1:45:55] it'll bring forth its fruits in its
[1:45:57] season it will not its sleep will not
[1:46:00] wither amen it will it will not it will
[1:46:03] not die and decay are you with me amen
[1:46:06] it'll be an everlasting eternal tree
[1:46:10] and he said that the branch it will be
[1:46:13] energized by the life of the vine
[1:46:16] jesus having no lips but your lips
[1:46:19] no eyes but yours and mine
[1:46:22] amen no hands but yours and mine he
[1:46:25] energizes us oh listen that's the power
[1:46:28] of the holy ghost
[1:46:30] energizing the people
[1:46:32] setting them on fire
[1:46:34] are you with me now amen whether it's
[1:46:36] preaching the gospel well whatever it is
[1:46:39] about or seeing a vision by the eye
[1:46:42] laying hands on the sick it's christ
[1:46:45] working through the branches of that
[1:46:47] church every office literally
[1:46:50] electrified by his presence
[1:46:53] hallelujah you don't have to live a
[1:46:55] backslidden complacent life
[1:46:58] unless you've been cut off of the tree
[1:47:00] but i'll tell you if you're in the tree
[1:47:02] the light that is in that tree will
[1:47:05] energize the branch and bring put the
[1:47:08] power out of that branch
[1:47:10] hallelujah listen it has been prophesied
[1:47:13] the promised seed will come
[1:47:18] amen there has to be somebody that is in
[1:47:21] the image of the lord there has to be a
[1:47:23] church
[1:47:24] that believes in the full gospel there
[1:47:27] has to be a church that has the full
[1:47:29] word manifest in itself not just part of
[1:47:32] the word the full word manifested
[1:47:35] through a bright people because she's a
[1:47:37] word bride
[1:47:41] but there will also be another
[1:47:44] who will not be of the promise
[1:47:50] that was this is a pentecost
[1:47:53] it was not the seed
[1:47:55] and although like ishmael was the seed
[1:47:57] of abraham
[1:47:59] it's not the promised seed
[1:48:02] yet
[1:48:04] god would appear to hagar i'm trying to
[1:48:06] get something to it
[1:48:09] because you're gonna you know there will
[1:48:11] be signs wonders miracles
[1:48:14] there will be
[1:48:15] manifestations
[1:48:18] will be healings
[1:48:19] when people believe
[1:48:22] are you with me
[1:48:23] amen yeah and so you know the angel
[1:48:26] appeared to hagar
[1:48:29] and showed her springs of water revivals
[1:48:33] they will have revivals
[1:48:35] great meetings
[1:48:37] miracles signs wonders
[1:48:41] but so will the bride
[1:48:45] come on amen it's
[1:48:47] not just the angel appearing to out here
[1:48:50] to hagar
[1:48:51] it's not just blessing on them it's on
[1:48:54] isaac in isaac shall i see be blessed
[1:48:57] [Applause]
[1:48:58] don't lose sight of who we are
[1:49:06] genesis 17 20.
[1:49:08] as far as ishmael i've heard thee
[1:49:11] behold i will bless him
[1:49:13] i've made him fruitful i'll make him a
[1:49:15] great nation
[1:49:16] i make great denominations out of them
[1:49:20] and they get blessed prosper
[1:49:23] big buildings great programs they do
[1:49:25] great things they're gathering
[1:49:28] don't count all of them out some of them
[1:49:30] are in the book of life
[1:49:34] some of them wind up at the white throne
[1:49:35] judgment after the tribulation
[1:49:38] on the other side of the millennium and
[1:49:40] they're given life
[1:49:45] but they're not isaac
[1:49:47] they're not the promised seed
[1:49:51] i want to get you i want to get you here
[1:49:52] because my covenant verse 21
[1:49:55] i will i establish with isaac
[1:50:00] the supernatural seed
[1:50:03] amen yet there will be great gatherings
[1:50:05] there will be great moves
[1:50:08] there will be great bindings
[1:50:12] great harvest time
[1:50:14] some will be
[1:50:16] bound together and their common thread
[1:50:18] will be
[1:50:19] gifts of the spirit
[1:50:21] speaking in tongues
[1:50:23] others will be bound together by by
[1:50:26] their methods of justification or
[1:50:28] sanctification and it'll bind them all
[1:50:31] together and and they all come together
[1:50:34] as one and bundled together
[1:50:36] but there's also being a bride gathered
[1:50:40] don't forget and all of this what god's
[1:50:43] real purpose is sometimes we look out
[1:50:46] here and we're so we're so about
[1:50:49] identifying them and identifying oh they
[1:50:52] got miracles and signs and watch out and
[1:50:54] what tell listen it ain't the signs and
[1:50:56] wonders to watch out for
[1:51:00] the signs and wonders are yours
[1:51:03] they're your inheritance
[1:51:05] the angel was not
[1:51:06] yes and because she was a part of
[1:51:09] abraham's group
[1:51:11] she got some of the blessings and the
[1:51:13] the angel came by and the angels spoke
[1:51:17] and the angels sold sell thousands of
[1:51:19] water and the angel the angel bless them
[1:51:27] but that's not
[1:51:28] what god's purpose and plan was
[1:51:31] god's promise and purpose is get a bride
[1:51:33] in a rapture
[1:51:36] and she's not going to be a weak
[1:51:38] powerless group of people
[1:51:40] whose only weapon is argument
[1:51:47] that she got a better argument than
[1:51:48] somebody else
[1:51:50] about the godhead or about the original
[1:51:52] sin or about water baptism or
[1:51:55] that's not it
[1:51:58] are you with me
[1:51:59] now both ishmael and isaac are called
[1:52:01] abraham's seed but god makes a
[1:52:03] distinction
[1:52:06] and he actually brings a separation
[1:52:09] and he says the children of the bombs
[1:52:11] woman will not be heir with the free
[1:52:14] woman
[1:52:16] they will not go in the rapture together
[1:52:20] i've got a body change for one i've got
[1:52:22] come on
[1:52:24] i've got an appearance and i've gotten
[1:52:26] revealed of the mysteries to one there's
[1:52:29] one that this is what i came for this is
[1:52:32] my purpose this is my plan but yeah i'll
[1:52:35] save them too
[1:52:36] yes i remember it's meal too
[1:52:47] now
[1:52:50] this is what makes it really hard
[1:52:53] because of scissor street pentecost
[1:52:56] and the bride people the bride age are
[1:53:00] also called pentecost
[1:53:04] and one is the original
[1:53:07] and the other has made the first claim
[1:53:09] on it
[1:53:12] now here comes the wheat plant again
[1:53:14] just before the grain of wheat comes
[1:53:17] there's a stage that looks exactly like
[1:53:20] the grain
[1:53:21] and can be mistaken for the full corn
[1:53:24] but it's not
[1:53:26] it's the shout out
[1:53:28] now brother branham tells us in resume
[1:53:30] of the ages that this age started just
[1:53:34] after the turn of the 20th century
[1:53:36] and it was to be the age in which the
[1:53:38] true church would return to being the
[1:53:40] bride she was at pentecost and let me
[1:53:42] tell you it still is
[1:53:44] god hadn't given up on this promise
[1:53:47] we know that there must be a necessity
[1:53:50] of necessity to be a return to dynamic
[1:53:52] power the believers sensed this in their
[1:53:55] spirits and began crying out to god for
[1:53:58] new outpourings such as was at the first
[1:54:00] century
[1:54:01] and what seemed
[1:54:03] to be the answer it wasn't the answer
[1:54:06] but it seemed to be the answer
[1:54:09] came as many begin to speak in tongues
[1:54:11] and manifest the gifts of the spirit it
[1:54:13] was then believed that this was the
[1:54:15] long-awaited restoration it was not
[1:54:20] now i want you to get from your
[1:54:21] messenger azusa pentecost was not
[1:54:26] the restoration
[1:54:29] so they were not the book of acts
[1:54:31] and they were not the true pentecost
[1:54:34] but there is one that is
[1:54:38] she is about
[1:54:40] come on now his word can't fall to the
[1:54:42] ground yeah you've got issue but that's
[1:54:45] not what i intended
[1:54:47] that never was my plan i've got a
[1:54:50] greater plan than that
[1:54:52] and yeah i'll save him too but there's
[1:54:54] more that i'm going to do with the
[1:54:56] bright elect people
[1:55:00] and he said that's what was thought to
[1:55:02] be a restoration and final quicken into
[1:55:04] the rapture had not come
[1:55:07] it was a mixture of unrighteous
[1:55:10] partaking with spiritual blessings and
[1:55:12] manifesting the holy ghost
[1:55:14] or the mixture the unrighteous partaking
[1:55:16] of spiritual blessings manifesting in
[1:55:18] the holy ghost
[1:55:20] it was devil power
[1:55:22] also devil power as men were under the
[1:55:24] control of devils yet no one seemed to
[1:55:27] realize it and then to prove it was not
[1:55:30] real
[1:55:31] these people before a second generation
[1:55:33] had appeared organized and wrote their
[1:55:36] unscriptural doctrines and built their
[1:55:38] own fences as every group ahead of them
[1:55:40] did
[1:55:42] so again he gives identification he said
[1:55:45] they become a bounce woman
[1:55:49] there wasn't a free woman
[1:55:51] they identified them as a hagar
[1:55:53] themselves as a hagar not a sarah
[1:55:57] so these pentecostal charismatic full
[1:56:01] gospel people
[1:56:02] were given the promise of el shaddai god
[1:56:06] was leading them right there
[1:56:09] notice this the open book
[1:56:13] about the old and the new testament
[1:56:18] but they took the breast of denomination
[1:56:22] specifically
[1:56:24] the dogma of speaking in tongues as the
[1:56:27] initial evidence
[1:56:28] and they denied the birth of the word
[1:56:35] now
[1:56:37] brother brandon says some very startling
[1:56:39] statements and i want you to get this
[1:56:42] he watched the pentecost slate after he
[1:56:45] comes there he made the promise of el
[1:56:47] shaddai
[1:56:49] nurse for me let's stop here just a
[1:56:51] minute remember shaddai comes from the
[1:56:54] root word breast
[1:56:56] well you say what does god have to do
[1:56:58] with breast he god
[1:57:00] god there
[1:57:02] god was giving birth so in the type he
[1:57:05] is shown himself as
[1:57:07] one who has given birth to a child
[1:57:11] abraham you're 99 but you're just a baby
[1:57:14] to me
[1:57:15] and because you're mine i got the right
[1:57:18] to name you
[1:57:20] so he gets a new name
[1:57:24] come on
[1:57:25] amen i'm going to give you my covenant
[1:57:28] which is a seal of circumcision
[1:57:31] amen that you that the world is cut off
[1:57:34] and you're marked by me you are mine
[1:57:37] are you with me
[1:57:39] and i'm changing your name and i'm
[1:57:41] changing sarah's name
[1:57:43] and i'm giving you now the full promise
[1:57:47] i'm going to give you both breasts of
[1:57:50] the old testament and the new testament
[1:57:52] i'm going to give you of the full word
[1:57:55] of god
[1:57:58] i'm going to give you the full gospel
[1:58:00] the whole word
[1:58:01] every promise
[1:58:03] every provision
[1:58:06] are you with me
[1:58:08] amen and that was offered to the
[1:58:11] pentecostals to have a real birth
[1:58:15] and but they didn't do it they grabbed
[1:58:17] the breasts from denomination where they
[1:58:20] come out of i'm quoting but then the
[1:58:22] real seed real seed
[1:58:25] came to nurse on that breast
[1:58:32] now the azusa movement organized on the
[1:58:35] evidence of the holy ghost being
[1:58:37] speaking in tongues
[1:58:39] even daddy bosworth
[1:58:40] knew this was wrong and lost his
[1:58:42] position among him he got kicked out of
[1:58:44] the assembly of god because of his
[1:58:46] position
[1:58:48] but they took the breasts to
[1:58:49] denomination by
[1:58:50] nursing
[1:58:52] for their strength a dogma of the church
[1:58:55] of the initial evidence of the holy
[1:58:57] ghost
[1:58:58] now this is where
[1:58:59] they pentecos gets the azusa movement
[1:59:02] gets their strength from i spoke in
[1:59:04] tongues
[1:59:08] and if they need strength again they
[1:59:10] just go back and speak in tongues again
[1:59:14] they draw from the dogma
[1:59:16] a dogma is a a a a
[1:59:20] a belief
[1:59:22] that is that is set aside by the church
[1:59:25] and they draw from the belief of the
[1:59:27] church that that is the initial evidence
[1:59:30] and the bible never places it as the
[1:59:33] initial evidence
[1:59:36] now
[1:59:37] so again
[1:59:38] you see
[1:59:40] it is not
[1:59:42] tongues is not the evidence of the holy
[1:59:44] ghost tongues is a gift
[1:59:47] of the spirit
[1:59:48] and not the spirit
[1:59:51] and yet they can still speak with
[1:59:53] tongues bob there
[1:59:55] paint their face
[1:59:57] drink their cocktails cross dress
[1:59:59] sniff a little cocaine marry divorce
[2:00:02] remarry
[2:00:05] drink alcohol
[2:00:07] get drunk get rescued for drunk driving
[2:00:10] and even even sometimes they didn't even
[2:00:13] have to many times to leave their
[2:00:14] denomination they could still be
[2:00:16] episcopalian
[2:00:18] catholic
[2:00:20] and yet recruit re and reject the truths
[2:00:23] of the word of god
[2:00:26] brother branham's telling us over again
[2:00:27] the holy ghost cannot deny himself
[2:00:31] let's get it straight the holy ghost
[2:00:33] will agree with every word of god
[2:00:37] seed not arab with the shock he said but
[2:00:39] when you come to say i and my father won
[2:00:42] remember that's what jesus did he come
[2:00:44] and brought further part of the word
[2:00:47] and when he said i my father won they
[2:00:49] all left him so we can't receive this
[2:00:52] and so when they come to i am my father
[2:00:55] one these other things like original sin
[2:00:58] baptism in the name of jesus christ
[2:01:01] one god
[2:01:02] the shock the shock mocks that that's
[2:01:06] right
[2:01:06] and then the chuck pulls away from that
[2:01:10] but then he says the real genuine bride
[2:01:13] church will bring forth the entire
[2:01:16] word of god in its fullness and in
[2:01:19] strength for he is the same yesterday
[2:01:22] today and forever
[2:01:24] so i want you to get it the real genuine
[2:01:27] bride church will bring forth
[2:01:30] the entire word of god
[2:01:33] amen in its fullness in its strength for
[2:01:37] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:01:39] forever
[2:01:40] amen
[2:01:42] now
[2:01:43] as he said in seed not air with the
[2:01:45] shell pentecost took speaking in tongues
[2:01:49] and they denied the birth of the word
[2:01:52] that's exactly what they did they'll
[2:01:54] take so much of it
[2:01:55] but they won't take the rest of it
[2:01:57] denied the birth of the word like mary
[2:01:58] did watch there won't be no more
[2:02:00] organizations after this no notice what
[2:02:02] they did they took
[2:02:05] they took from the breast of
[2:02:06] denomination here here instead of a seed
[2:02:09] coming that came from el shaddai from
[2:02:13] the supernatural
[2:02:14] and from abraham nursing his strength
[2:02:17] here it comes from a bones woman
[2:02:21] and the strength they're getting comes
[2:02:23] from the bones woman
[2:02:25] of an initial evidence
[2:02:28] of speaking in tongues
[2:02:32] now
[2:02:33] but what there will be no more
[2:02:35] organizations after this
[2:02:38] you see ishmael came by reasoning
[2:02:41] and by man's own human efforts to bring
[2:02:43] the word to
[2:02:44] pass instead of the supernatural
[2:02:48] the azusa bunch like abraham did they
[2:02:51] took speaking in tongues they worked up
[2:02:53] emotions with manufactured tongues
[2:02:55] instead of waiting for the real
[2:02:57] manifestations of god
[2:03:00] but what
[2:03:01] there will be no more organizations
[2:03:03] after this
[2:03:05] god won't deal with another
[2:03:07] that don't mean there won't be another
[2:03:09] form that means god will not deal with
[2:03:11] another
[2:03:13] the move of god will not come through
[2:03:15] another
[2:03:17] now so again that
[2:03:19] that means that god will not use another
[2:03:22] organization to bring his word through
[2:03:27] now physically
[2:03:28] the israelites today are a great nation
[2:03:31] of arabs
[2:03:32] that surround isaac the jews
[2:03:35] they demand to receive the inheritance
[2:03:37] only given to israel
[2:03:40] right so is the church billions
[2:03:44] compared to the bride
[2:03:47] are you with me and they are claiming
[2:03:49] the same inheritance
[2:03:51] they're trying to put their foot on the
[2:03:53] ever promise the rapture the body change
[2:03:57] divine healing anything that belongs to
[2:04:00] the bride of christ they want it too
[2:04:03] they are israelites
[2:04:06] now there are
[2:04:09] i'm going to just use some facts here
[2:04:10] for a minute
[2:04:12] there are
[2:04:13] 2.3 billion christians in the world
[2:04:16] today
[2:04:18] in terms of overall number
[2:04:21] the world christian
[2:04:23] currently counts
[2:04:25] 644
[2:04:27] million of them
[2:04:29] are pentecostal charismatics worldwide
[2:04:32] including all the members of
[2:04:34] pentecostalism's
[2:04:36] 19000 300 denominations and fellowships
[2:04:45] so the movement that began in 1906
[2:04:51] has now grown and has mighty branches
[2:04:56] 19
[2:04:57] 300
[2:04:59] denominations
[2:05:01] and fellowships
[2:05:04] out of them have come
[2:05:06] more than a half a billion converts
[2:05:10] now you don't me if you don't think that
[2:05:13] they become a great people
[2:05:17] think about what
[2:05:18] think about these numbers if you can
[2:05:20] wrap your mind around it for a minute
[2:05:23] that they're you know we have
[2:05:26] 8.3 percent of the world's population
[2:05:30] that's what we're talking about
[2:05:32] one in 12 persons today is pentecostal
[2:05:35] or charismatic
[2:05:39] one in 12.
[2:05:41] and looking at the current global
[2:05:43] distribution of pentecostal charismatic
[2:05:46] christians
[2:05:47] the encyclopedia counts 230 million in
[2:05:50] africa 195 million in latin america 125
[2:05:53] million in asia 68 million north america
[2:05:57] uh 21 million in europe and 4.5 million
[2:06:01] in australia and oceania
[2:06:03] now you're not going to tell me friends
[2:06:05] that god hadn't blessed them
[2:06:08] and there hadn't been a huge gathering
[2:06:12] brother branham told us he said even
[2:06:14] when it was happening he said i foresee
[2:06:16] it as as the foolish virgins being
[2:06:20] gathered
[2:06:22] because they are not getting the oil
[2:06:26] you see they they might have a
[2:06:28] profession of fire but their light goes
[2:06:31] out
[2:06:36] now the pentecostal charismatic
[2:06:39] movements one of the fastest growing
[2:06:40] trends in the world chris of
[2:06:42] christianity today
[2:06:44] you know it has been for some time it
[2:06:46] grew from 58 million in 1970
[2:06:49] and now is 6.56
[2:06:53] million or six six five uh 656 million
[2:06:57] 6.56 billion
[2:07:00] think about that or half a billion
[2:07:02] little over
[2:07:04] 0.65 million billion
[2:07:07] now
[2:07:08] 0.65 billion they've added
[2:07:10] six million people
[2:07:14] since 1970.
[2:07:17] now if you don't think there's been a
[2:07:18] revival
[2:07:23] if you don't think there's been a stir
[2:07:26] if you don't think there's been
[2:07:28] something happening
[2:07:30] it's been happening
[2:07:34] now
[2:07:35] and
[2:07:36] and how did they do this
[2:07:38] through speaking in tongues
[2:07:40] and in many cases
[2:07:42] i want to get this
[2:07:44] it started out as genuine
[2:07:50] but then impersonations followed
[2:07:54] until today
[2:07:56] there's hardly a thread of it
[2:07:59] but what that is real and becomes just
[2:08:01] worked up emotion
[2:08:03] until there is now
[2:08:05] 19
[2:08:06] 300 denominations
[2:08:08] and fellowships
[2:08:11] pentecost
[2:08:13] is a form of christianity that
[2:08:15] emphasizes the work of the spirit and
[2:08:17] the direct experience of the presence of
[2:08:19] god by the believers pentecostals
[2:08:21] believe that faith must be powerful
[2:08:23] powerfully
[2:08:25] experiential and not something found
[2:08:28] merely through ritual or thinking
[2:08:29] pentecostalism is energetic and dynamic
[2:08:33] therefore it is a different experience
[2:08:35] you have with the person of christ and
[2:08:37] no certain uncertain time is a
[2:08:38] life-changing moment you can't come to
[2:08:41] through to true christianity through
[2:08:43] your intellect you have to be willing to
[2:08:46] experience it first
[2:08:48] and that's exactly what our message
[2:08:50] teaches
[2:08:57] that you can't come
[2:08:59] with just your intellect
[2:09:01] you've got to experience it first
[2:09:04] and it's a life-changing moment
[2:09:08] and it's a devin experience with the
[2:09:09] person of christ
[2:09:12] and it's energetic and it's dynamic
[2:09:15] it's something that you know
[2:09:19] brother branham types it as a world
[2:09:22] being renewed for the new earth is not a
[2:09:24] reformed earth
[2:09:25] through a reformation but a
[2:09:27] transformation it's not a dried-eyed
[2:09:29] confession but the igniting of the fire
[2:09:33] so he states that the baptism of the
[2:09:35] holy spirit
[2:09:37] is a definite experience that a person
[2:09:40] must receive
[2:09:42] and he tells us he explains this in
[2:09:44] future home he tells us it is an
[2:09:47] experience he said it's just like the
[2:09:49] world when the world gets renovated for
[2:09:51] the new heavens and the new earth he
[2:09:53] said you talk about explosion he said
[2:09:56] why the heavens will catch on fire
[2:09:58] he said that it'll pass away with a
[2:10:00] great noise
[2:10:02] and and it'll be an explosion it will
[2:10:04] rock the whole thing got to kill every
[2:10:06] disease and every thistle and every
[2:10:09] thorn and the fire will burn it up and
[2:10:11] remember he said it's not just a literal
[2:10:13] fire it's a holy fire
[2:10:16] and we're not talking about the burning
[2:10:18] for the millennium now we're talking
[2:10:19] about the new heavens and new earth
[2:10:21] where god comes to live on it
[2:10:23] and he types it out with the same thing
[2:10:25] he said when a man receives the baptism
[2:10:28] of fire there's a lot of noise around
[2:10:30] there
[2:10:31] they think it's a shame to hear people
[2:10:33] scream and shout like that but just wait
[2:10:35] until the earth gets her baptism
[2:10:39] so he types at the same thing you know
[2:10:41] that that sin nature is burned off
[2:10:44] every shred of the devil
[2:10:46] ever
[2:10:47] come on now every disease of sin
[2:10:50] every evil thing gets burned away
[2:10:54] and christ comes to live upon it and
[2:10:56] it's an explosion
[2:11:00] are you with me
[2:11:02] so brother branham taught us the same
[2:11:04] thing he said you cannot receive the
[2:11:06] baptism of the holy ghost without an
[2:11:09] experience when it happens
[2:11:13] now if you believe say you believe every
[2:11:14] speck of the word you say you say you
[2:11:16] believe every speck of it then the word
[2:11:18] is laying in there waiting for the holy
[2:11:20] spirit to put it to work but it takes
[2:11:22] the light into the candle
[2:11:24] here's a candle with a wick and the
[2:11:26] tallow and everything in that candle
[2:11:28] to make that candle and he said then the
[2:11:31] fire comes on it but until it comes it
[2:11:33] will not shine any light no matter how
[2:11:35] perfect the candle is how perfect it'll
[2:11:37] burn it's got to be litten and then it
[2:11:40] burns and when you believe and are made
[2:11:42] up of the instructions and the holy
[2:11:44] spirit of love joy peace long suffering
[2:11:46] goodness the fruits that bears out until
[2:11:49] the holy spirit with a fiery experience
[2:11:52] comes down and lights that candle you
[2:11:55] haven't received the holy ghost you've
[2:11:57] got to have the experience
[2:12:00] to have the holy ghost
[2:12:04] say brother tim that's pentecostal yes
[2:12:06] they preach an experience we should be
[2:12:08] preaching experience too
[2:12:10] we certainly should not be preaching
[2:12:13] baptist doctrine
[2:12:14] or you just believe the message and you
[2:12:16] got it
[2:12:20] you see it's not just simply believing
[2:12:24] and then confessing you have it
[2:12:26] the token is the holy ghost and let me
[2:12:29] tell you the fullness of it didn't come
[2:12:31] to the evening time when the full word
[2:12:35] was born into manifestation by the
[2:12:37] opening of the seventh seal do you
[2:12:39] realize that you are a people
[2:12:42] who for the first time
[2:12:44] in seven ages
[2:12:46] since the fall of the church can have
[2:12:49] the same baptism
[2:12:51] of the holy ghost that they did on the
[2:12:54] day of pentecost
[2:12:56] do you realize it come because the full
[2:12:59] word has been restored and out of that
[2:13:02] word is coming to birth
[2:13:04] a supernatural birth
[2:13:06] [Applause]
[2:13:14] you must have the token the holy ghost
[2:13:16] if you just substitute the word token
[2:13:18] for holy ghost that's what the word
[2:13:20] token is the holy ghost
[2:13:23] you must have the holy ghost just plain
[2:13:25] without it all your believing is in vain
[2:13:28] you'll live a good life you listen to
[2:13:29] what the word said you go to church you
[2:13:31] try to live right that's fine but that's
[2:13:33] not it when i see the blood that's the
[2:13:35] token you say why the blood because on
[2:13:38] the day there on the day of pentecost or
[2:13:41] at calvary the blood cell was split open
[2:13:45] releasing the life of god and on the day
[2:13:47] of pentecost they were born of the birth
[2:13:50] of god
[2:13:52] born of the blood
[2:13:53] the light that was in the blood came
[2:13:55] back upon the believers
[2:13:57] now you say well i believe every word
[2:13:59] brother branham every word said
[2:14:02] brother branham that's good but that's
[2:14:03] just being able to read
[2:14:05] you look in the bible
[2:14:07] you know they did not receive the holy
[2:14:09] ghost when they believed but after they
[2:14:11] believed
[2:14:13] you see down in samaria let's go to acts
[2:14:16] chapter 8 and verse 13. i'll just give
[2:14:19] an example there's two places in there
[2:14:21] where you were sealed by the holy spirit
[2:14:23] of god
[2:14:24] after believing but watch down in
[2:14:26] samaria they had received the word but
[2:14:29] had not received the holy ghost
[2:14:31] they had believed and received the word
[2:14:33] but still needed the experience
[2:14:35] acts chapter 8 verse 13 and simon
[2:14:38] himself believed also and was baptized
[2:14:42] in a few minutes he gets to be called a
[2:14:45] child of the devil
[2:14:48] because he tries to buy the gift
[2:14:51] amen but he also believed and when he
[2:14:54] was by and when he was baptized he
[2:14:56] continued with philip wandered behold in
[2:14:59] the miracles and signs that were done
[2:15:01] and when the apostles were at jerusalem
[2:15:03] heard that samara had received the word
[2:15:06] of god did you notice they had received
[2:15:09] the message
[2:15:12] amen today we would say well that
[2:15:14] brothers believe the serpent seed
[2:15:17] that brother has believed god sent a
[2:15:19] prophet but that brother believes the
[2:15:20] seals is open that brother has accepted
[2:15:23] and embraced only he believes and now in
[2:15:26] baptism in jesus name we baptize he's
[2:15:28] got the holy ghost no he doesn't
[2:15:33] he has received the word not the spirit
[2:15:36] he has received and recognized and
[2:15:38] believed on the theology
[2:15:41] but he has not received the holy ghost
[2:15:43] it's an experience
[2:15:48] watch
[2:15:50] so mary had received the word of god
[2:15:52] they sent them john peter and john who
[2:15:55] when they were come down prayed for them
[2:15:57] that they might receive the holy ghost
[2:15:58] far as yet he was falling upon none of
[2:16:01] them only they were baptized in the name
[2:16:04] of the lord jesus and then they laid
[2:16:06] their hands on them and they received
[2:16:09] the holy ghost
[2:16:11] so i want you to notice they believed
[2:16:13] received the word embraced its doctrines
[2:16:15] accepted its truth and still needed the
[2:16:17] spirit
[2:16:20] and that's the problem in many message
[2:16:22] churches today
[2:16:24] they've done all of that and ain't got
[2:16:26] the holy ghost
[2:16:28] therefore they're not living overcoming
[2:16:30] lives
[2:16:34] now jesus speaking of the holy ghost in
[2:16:36] that day he told us yes in that day ye
[2:16:40] shall know
[2:16:44] not guess
[2:16:45] not hope not imagine
[2:16:48] not believe because the preacher said go
[2:16:50] back to your seat boy you got it
[2:16:54] i want you to get this
[2:16:56] jesus said you will know that i'm in the
[2:16:59] father the father me and i and you
[2:17:03] so the holy ghost is something you can
[2:17:05] know
[2:17:06] paul said in philippians chapter 3 and
[2:17:09] verse 9
[2:17:10] and and being found in him not having my
[2:17:13] known righteousness which is of the law
[2:17:15] but that which is through the faith of
[2:17:17] christ the righteousness which is of god
[2:17:19] by faith and he says that i might know
[2:17:24] him
[2:17:28] what and the power of his resurrection
[2:17:33] now notice that i may
[2:17:35] know him
[2:17:37] this says this is not a guest this is
[2:17:40] not an imagination
[2:17:42] this is a knowledge you know him
[2:17:47] notice this and that i might know him
[2:17:49] and the power of his resurrection
[2:17:54] how do you know the power of his
[2:17:56] resurrection
[2:17:58] is when you yourself died to sin
[2:18:02] and raise up triumphantly over sin
[2:18:05] just as he rose up triumphant over death
[2:18:09] hell and the grave
[2:18:13] notice now we've got to know him in the
[2:18:15] power of his resurrection i once was
[2:18:17] dead
[2:18:18] i can point to a dead man but i'm alive
[2:18:20] now
[2:18:22] and i have the keys to death and of hell
[2:18:24] come on that's that's the experience of
[2:18:26] every true baptized born again believer
[2:18:30] are you with me so now again in the in
[2:18:32] the late
[2:18:33] 19th late 1800s i'm gonna get this as we
[2:18:37] kind of move right down into this
[2:18:39] thought now
[2:18:40] in the late
[2:18:42] in the late 1800s in preparation for the
[2:18:44] last age
[2:18:46] there was an open door the bible speaks
[2:18:48] to this an open door that was set before
[2:18:50] the world and the holy ghost began to be
[2:18:53] poured out
[2:18:55] now
[2:18:57] this will explain to you why the world
[2:19:00] is in the condition it's in
[2:19:04] and he tells you in jubilee year
[2:19:06] he said the baptism of the holy spirit
[2:19:09] fell the first time since pentecost in
[2:19:12] russia
[2:19:16] back a hundred years ago which that
[2:19:18] would be about by his calculation then
[2:19:22] would be 1854.
[2:19:25] and that's history now
[2:19:26] i've been i've done quite a bit of
[2:19:28] history on that
[2:19:29] that those russians would spill over
[2:19:31] into armenia
[2:19:33] and armenia there would receive the
[2:19:35] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:19:37] and through a prophecy given by a boy
[2:19:40] prophet of eight years old who
[2:19:42] prophesied you're going to have to leave
[2:19:45] armenia and flee to the west
[2:19:48] and go and he describes a country never
[2:19:50] seen a map and describes how to get
[2:19:53] there and you will land on the east side
[2:19:55] and you will
[2:19:56] you will go in the west side and you
[2:19:58] will be blessed
[2:20:00] and it's there that there will be a
[2:20:01] blessing that will fall that will bless
[2:20:04] the world
[2:20:07] and demonstration
[2:20:12] of armenian descent
[2:20:14] was a grandson
[2:20:16] of those who moved from armenia
[2:20:20] because they listened to a prophecy
[2:20:23] that was given by the holy spirit
[2:20:26] as they there had received the spirit
[2:20:29] from there from the visitation of the
[2:20:31] russians and received the message of
[2:20:34] pentecost and now they come over there
[2:20:36] and then they find there that the same
[2:20:38] tongues and gifts and things are
[2:20:40] happening on azusa street
[2:20:42] and there demon secarion would in 1952
[2:20:45] begin the full gospel businessmen that
[2:20:48] would be an oasis for brother branham
[2:20:50] where that the voice could be heard
[2:20:54] the voice the midnight cry
[2:20:57] amen to the to the all the virgins all
[2:21:00] the virgins the wise and the foolish go
[2:21:03] you out to meet him the bridegroom
[2:21:05] cometh the message of his coming
[2:21:09] and it would be herald and there would
[2:21:11] be an awakening among the foolish and
[2:21:13] that would realize we don't have the
[2:21:15] holy ghost we don't have the oil and
[2:21:17] instead of getting it they get tongues
[2:21:19] instead
[2:21:21] and it binds them together and they
[2:21:23] never hear the call come out of her my
[2:21:25] people
[2:21:29] they never get the prophecy
[2:21:31] so they wind up in the tribulation
[2:21:36] but there
[2:21:38] in in russia the holy spirit fell and i
[2:21:41] want you to think moves over to armenia
[2:21:43] these people hear it
[2:21:45] they will they will receive it they will
[2:21:47] embrace it prophecy falls among them
[2:21:49] real prophecy
[2:21:51] and with this prophecy they will cross
[2:21:53] crossed the sea and they would come and
[2:21:56] they would wind up in l.a
[2:21:58] and while there
[2:22:00] while there that because of heeding that
[2:22:03] prophecy
[2:22:04] because it would be 50 years later after
[2:22:06] the prophecy that the
[2:22:08] that that that boy prophet now a man
[2:22:11] would say now the lord is revealed as
[2:22:13] the time let's flee now and they sold
[2:22:15] out sold out their farms their heritage
[2:22:17] their family heritage everything moved
[2:22:19] across the seas
[2:22:21] it was driven
[2:22:24] to get out of there
[2:22:26] you know why
[2:22:27] a persecution was coming
[2:22:30] and and then you know what happened in
[2:22:32] armenia if you know history they
[2:22:34] extermina and terminated on a million of
[2:22:37] them a genocide of the whole people and
[2:22:39] wiped out
[2:22:41] the whole countryside
[2:22:44] the turks did it that's right
[2:22:48] now so the holy spirit fell there in
[2:22:51] russia now watch brother branham said
[2:22:54] the baptism of the holy ghost fell
[2:22:56] the first time since pentecost in russia
[2:22:59] 100 years ago that's right that's
[2:23:01] history and they had the baptism of the
[2:23:04] holy spirit worked signs and wonders a
[2:23:06] hundred years ago and
[2:23:08] rejected it
[2:23:10] russia
[2:23:11] as a nation and turned it down and when
[2:23:14] they did they have now turned to an
[2:23:16] anti-god
[2:23:18] anti-religious
[2:23:20] become communists cold
[2:23:22] brutal hearted
[2:23:24] if you won't listen to god he'll give
[2:23:26] you over to a spirit that'll condemn you
[2:23:29] and be turned over to a reprobate mine
[2:23:31] to believe a lie and be damned by it and
[2:23:33] that's where the russian stands tonight
[2:23:36] is damned in the sight of god because it
[2:23:39] failed to receive the jubilee message of
[2:23:42] the baptism of the holy spirit that were
[2:23:45] turned over to a reprobate mind they
[2:23:47] believed a lie and are down by it in the
[2:23:50] sight of god that's russia
[2:23:54] that's the condition of that country
[2:23:57] all americans can now clap their hands
[2:24:00] and say oh yeah you know down with
[2:24:02] russian up with ukraine and up with this
[2:24:05] and up with america well listen to this
[2:24:08] and it's your life worthy of the gospel
[2:24:10] i want you to listen to this indictment
[2:24:12] against the nations
[2:24:15] because remember in our generation
[2:24:18] they are rejecting the seal of god
[2:24:21] remember laodicea turns christ down
[2:24:27] now if russia had accepted the
[2:24:29] pentecostal blessing 75 years ago when
[2:24:32] the holy ghost fell in russia there
[2:24:34] wouldn't be communists today now 75
[2:24:37] years ago they had a great revival in
[2:24:38] russia god came among them they had
[2:24:40] great revivals weigh into siberia what
[2:24:43] did they do they rejected it
[2:24:45] and today the country is gone and the
[2:24:47] churches can't have church only under
[2:24:49] permission and they're doomed under into
[2:24:51] judgment has gone off in this wild
[2:24:53] tantrum of communism and sold out to the
[2:24:56] devil
[2:24:58] yay rushes of the devil
[2:25:03] 50 years ago the holy ghost fell in
[2:25:05] england
[2:25:07] just after that came george jeffries and
[2:25:10] f.l bosworth and charles price and smith
[2:25:13] wigglesworth and those great warriors of
[2:25:15] the faith 50 years ago and offered the
[2:25:17] england the holy ghost revival
[2:25:21] but what they do they laughed at them
[2:25:23] they put them in jail they called them
[2:25:24] crazy thought they'd lost their minds
[2:25:26] the churches refused the people to come
[2:25:28] hear them they were healed of they
[2:25:30] healed the sick and they cast out devils
[2:25:32] they'd done great work and because that
[2:25:35] because at england as a nation rejected
[2:25:38] the gospel her sins is known throughout
[2:25:41] the world there's hardly a more apostate
[2:25:43] nation in the world even including rome
[2:25:45] and france and then england she is a
[2:25:47] mother of apostasy right where finney
[2:25:50] and many of the great men preached in
[2:25:52] the hay market and charles g finney and
[2:25:54] wesley and on down and she turned it
[2:25:56] down
[2:25:58] and even last week in the paper she find
[2:26:00] out great men so weak into the sex of
[2:26:02] women until spies come in and their head
[2:26:04] man found some of them mowered them and
[2:26:07] their magazines just packed it in their
[2:26:09] sin scandals and right in their
[2:26:11] government is so disgrateful name their
[2:26:14] disgraceful name across the world she's
[2:26:16] rejected the truth she has her at her
[2:26:19] excuse and she finished she's finished
[2:26:23] the england is all washed up with god a
[2:26:25] long time ago
[2:26:28] yay
[2:26:30] england
[2:26:33] america
[2:26:34] 15 years ago
[2:26:36] nothing to say of azusa street
[2:26:39] but just 15 years ago this is 63 when
[2:26:42] the great divine healing revival
[2:26:44] continued on from pentecost to jesus
[2:26:46] street broke out in the nation and there
[2:26:48] was revivals in the capitals

[2:30:10] disgrace look at our nation today look
[2:30:12] at the condition of our nation look
[2:30:14] where she's went to how she has sunk
[2:30:17] and that was minor to what's going on

[2:30:22] it's not just in the governments in your
[2:30:25] neighborhood it's in your schools it's
[2:30:28] everywhere you look
[2:30:32] look at the religious system how can it
[2:30:34] be that the churches can ever get in
[2:30:36] that condition area now because they
[2:30:38] have rejected and refused the message of
[2:30:41] god the invitation to come to the feast
[2:30:45] could you call that a life worthy of the
[2:30:47] gospel that you could you call a life
[2:30:49] that would set and permit the people to
[2:30:52] do the things and smoke cigarettes and
[2:30:54] then he tells about a church
[2:30:56] you know what down at a ballgame they
[2:30:58] were having the pastor smoked cigarettes
[2:31:00] after another another baptist church
[2:31:03] they had to let out the for the church
[2:31:05] from sunday school and extra 15 minutes
[2:31:07] so they could smoke
[2:31:09] and he said john the john smith the
[2:31:11] founder that church prayed so hard that
[2:31:13] god sent a revival till his eyes swole
[2:31:16] at night and his wife had to lead him to
[2:31:18] the table and feed him with a spoon that
[2:31:21] man would turn over his grave if he knew
[2:31:22] the church that church had got in that
[2:31:25] condition that's the only thing remember
[2:31:27] jesus said those that were bidden and
[2:31:29] turned it down would not chase his
[2:31:32] supper
[2:31:34] when god i want you to hear this when
[2:31:37] god sends the holy ghost
[2:31:39] and he knocks at a man's door
[2:31:42] and he deliberately turns it down
[2:31:44] sometime he'll turn it down for his last
[2:31:48] time
[2:31:49] amen then you won't be a privileged
[2:31:51] character you can sit in church and
[2:31:53] listen to the gospel agree with the
[2:31:54] gospel it might be so much to say i know
[2:31:57] it's right but never put a finger to it
[2:31:59] to help yourself
[2:32:00] you just listen to it you know i believe
[2:32:03] it's right that's just sympathizing with
[2:32:05] i he said i can believe that's the ten
[2:32:06] thousand dollars or i could believe
[2:32:08] that's good water to drink i mean you
[2:32:11] know but refuse to drink it you know
[2:32:13] what i mean this is eternal life and to
[2:32:15] refuse it one day you'll cross the line
[2:32:18] between judgment and mercy you won't be
[2:32:21] privileged then to come and receive it
[2:32:23] let me tell you we're really close
[2:32:28] to letting those with our filthy be
[2:32:30] filthy still
[2:32:32] and those that are holy be holy still
[2:32:35] there comes a time where the line gets
[2:32:39] crossed there will be a day in the near
[2:32:42] future there'll not be another soul
[2:32:44] saved
[2:32:47] are you with me there's a day in the new
[2:32:50] fear near future not another opportunity
[2:32:53] will be given to really receive the life
[2:32:56] of jesus christ
[2:32:58] the last one will be receive the token
[2:33:01] the ticket the holy ghost to go in the
[2:33:04] rapture
[2:33:05] and you can't go without it
[2:33:08] are you with me we are in a serious hour
[2:33:12] and when the nation is condemned why
[2:33:14] don't we clap for america too because
[2:33:16] our nation is
[2:33:18] condemned she is lost she's crossed the
[2:33:21] line between judgment and mercy you
[2:33:24] can't vote somebody in that are changing
[2:33:28] you can't elect a president
[2:33:31] even the scallywag we got in with mr
[2:33:34] trump he couldn't do anything they
[2:33:36] fought him on every hand for every good
[2:33:38] thing he tried to do
[2:33:40] and they wrecked everything just as soon
[2:33:42] as they come in and wrecked it until we
[2:33:44] have a wrecked economy
[2:33:45] a wrecked nation
[2:33:47] wreck value
[2:33:50] wrecked police force wrecked everywhere
[2:33:52] erect political system everything is in
[2:33:55] shambles and there is no hope in this
[2:33:57] country the only hope there is is a
[2:34:00] rapture
[2:34:02] that's why it is so important for you
[2:34:04] today to be nursing from el shaddai
[2:34:07] to take your promises to get your
[2:34:10] strength from the holy ghost and pull
[2:34:12] from the word of god
[2:34:14] amen that's why it is important for you
[2:34:17] to nurse on that holy ghost until your
[2:34:20] body is changed until your experience is
[2:34:23] no more stale and stagnant and
[2:34:26] yesterday's memory but it is a fresh and
[2:34:29] it is up today it is something that
[2:34:31] you're getting straight from today
[2:34:33] [Applause]
[2:34:43] by rejecting your day of visitation
[2:34:46] it separates you from god
[2:34:55] now
[2:35:01] i've been laying these things in very
[2:35:03] methodically and very carefully
[2:35:07] i have been doing more teaching than
[2:35:09] preaching
[2:35:11] some of these brothers will pick up on
[2:35:13] some of these things and they'll catch
[2:35:14] the inspiration of it and they will
[2:35:16] preach it evangelistically
[2:35:19] but these things have got to be laid out
[2:35:23] where you fully understand where you're
[2:35:25] standing
[2:35:28] where you know your day your hour your
[2:35:30] visitation
[2:35:31] and what's important in this time
[2:35:34] when you preach you hit the surface of
[2:35:36] things
[2:35:38] now i'm going to go just a little
[2:35:40] further
[2:35:42] because i know i know our time is now
[2:35:44] running out
[2:35:46] and i haven't really got into where i
[2:35:48] want to go
[2:35:50] but i'll recap it back off when i come
[2:35:52] again next week i'll be in phoenix
[2:35:54] but i'll come back again
[2:35:56] and i'll recap some of this
[2:35:59] but i want you to know
[2:36:02] i want you just i want you to realize
[2:36:05] as we go through these things don't
[2:36:08] dismiss
[2:36:09] these move of gods in the past
[2:36:12] as something that wasn't real
[2:36:15] and that their experiences are unneeded
[2:36:20] in the early 1900s god dealt with the
[2:36:24] pentecostals
[2:36:25] with an outpouring of the holy ghost
[2:36:28] and since there's a bride of all ages
[2:36:31] there were elect pentecostals who
[2:36:33] received the message of the baptism of
[2:36:35] the holy ghost and they were elect men
[2:36:38] at their time don't look back at azusa
[2:36:40] street and say oh they're just a bunch
[2:36:42] of backwash that was a false move
[2:36:45] it was a real move
[2:36:47] it's where the life of god was at that
[2:36:50] time
[2:36:53] elect men
[2:36:55] among those elect was john g lake
[2:36:58] apostle to south africa great man of
[2:37:01] faith
[2:37:02] smith wigglesworth f bosworth
[2:37:06] host of many others
[2:37:08] there were also hundreds of other men
[2:37:10] and women who wrote on that wave of
[2:37:12] revival
[2:37:13] and they were born of the word for their
[2:37:16] age
[2:37:18] the truths that were being released at
[2:37:20] that time
[2:37:22] and let me just tell you of them they
[2:37:24] will make up them and be part of that
[2:37:27] great ransom throng in the
[2:37:30] resurrection they will be joined by
[2:37:33] wesley and the methodist age the luther
[2:37:35] and the lutheran age and the others from
[2:37:37] previous ages and they're just as much
[2:37:39] bright as we are
[2:37:42] they'll be at the marriage supper of the
[2:37:43] lamb
[2:37:46] however it is that same pentecostal
[2:37:50] azusa age
[2:37:51] not these elect women
[2:37:53] but
[2:37:55] the pentecostals who are that
[2:37:57] lukewarm portion
[2:37:59] who reject truth
[2:38:01] and are spewed out of the mouth of god
[2:38:05] and the real glory is gone the real
[2:38:07] outpouring of the spirit is void and
[2:38:10] many times it's just left even brother
[2:38:12] branham would make note of this with
[2:38:14] just a bunch of whooped up music where
[2:38:16] people are worked up
[2:38:19] and the tongues were given given away
[2:38:21] from the original to a worked up bunch
[2:38:23] of nonsense or a confusion of language
[2:38:28] i never received the holy ghost in a
[2:38:30] pentecostal meeting
[2:38:32] i went to pentecostal meetings till i
[2:38:33] was 9 years old 13
[2:38:36] 11 11 years old
[2:38:38] i've been the altar there i tried to get
[2:38:40] the holy ghost there
[2:38:45] i had my experience of being
[2:38:48] beat on the back
[2:38:51] my
[2:38:52] chin dribbled
[2:38:55] my
[2:38:56] instructions to say jesus jesus jesus
[2:38:59] jesus until you get a confusion of
[2:39:00] language i never could speak in tongues
[2:39:05] i have
[2:39:06] but i never did it there
[2:39:12] but let me tell you something it didn't
[2:39:14] start out that way
[2:39:18] and i'm going to just tell you our
[2:39:20] message did not start out as a powerless
[2:39:22] message
[2:39:25] without healing without miracles without
[2:39:28] signs without wonders without power
[2:39:31] it did not start out just
[2:39:34] simply believing the message is right
[2:39:37] and you got the holy ghost it didn't
[2:39:38] start that way
[2:39:43] the pentecostal movement
[2:39:46] if i could just go with you just for a
[2:39:47] moment
[2:39:49] because i want you to understand
[2:39:52] that though there is a false
[2:39:54] there is real
[2:39:58] and even brother branham would tell us
[2:40:00] in 1963 and stand in the gap he said
[2:40:02] though has been
[2:40:04] though it's been impersonated
[2:40:06] there's always to be a real genuine
[2:40:09] gift of speaking in tongues in the
[2:40:12] church
[2:40:13] but we as a message community have
[2:40:16] largely dismissed it
[2:40:18] all as being false
[2:40:20] and we threw out the baby with the
[2:40:22] bathwater
[2:40:27] but it didn't start out that way to be
[2:40:29] jabber and gibberish
[2:40:32] it started out as a genuine move of god
[2:40:37] genuine tongues that could be
[2:40:39] understood
[2:40:41] when the holy ghost fell it fell
[2:40:43] first in topeka canyon or topeka kansas
[2:40:48] under charles parnum
[2:40:50] this would happen about 1900 1906 would
[2:40:53] be azusa street
[2:40:55] it would start in that movement from a
[2:40:58] black brother who was a convert under
[2:41:00] charles parnum and was a
[2:41:03] who had been taught in his schools
[2:41:06] because he had he taught classes on the
[2:41:08] holy ghost
[2:41:12] and brother seymour would be
[2:41:14] would be um would receive that
[2:41:17] experience and then he would go to
[2:41:19] to azusa street preach these things or
[2:41:22] he would hear these things hear the
[2:41:23] priest and then would have that
[2:41:24] experience in 1906
[2:41:29] but when it fell in topeka canyon
[2:41:32] kansas
[2:41:33] i don't think there's even a canyon
[2:41:35] there
[2:41:36] but under charles parnum
[2:41:39] he talked about
[2:41:40] you know the history of that movement
[2:41:43] talks about a woman who rose in the
[2:41:45] meeting
[2:41:46] and spoke for 10 minutes
[2:41:48] no one in the audience knowing what she
[2:41:51] said
[2:41:52] and an indian who had come there and was
[2:41:55] visiting from the pawnee reservation
[2:41:57] in the territory that day and he visited
[2:42:00] the services
[2:42:02] she stated that she heard him speaking
[2:42:05] in the language of her tribe
[2:42:09] and that he could understand every word
[2:42:12] of the testimony
[2:42:16] there are no zeus street when the holy
[2:42:18] ghost fell there
[2:42:20] people traveled from all the world to
[2:42:22] investigate what was happening
[2:42:24] it was a large
[2:42:26] um
[2:42:27] probably more medium-sized auditorium
[2:42:30] with a upper room upstairs and
[2:42:33] the the place was open day and night for
[2:42:35] several years
[2:42:37] they would have preaching two or three
[2:42:38] times a day and the people would be in
[2:42:41] the prayer room day and night there was
[2:42:43] a prayer prayer going on night and day
[2:42:46] at the close of the preaching the crowds
[2:42:48] would
[2:42:49] would retire to the upper room to pray
[2:42:51] some more and
[2:42:52] when the time came from preaching every
[2:42:55] service the people had to be called from
[2:42:58] the from the upper room of the place
[2:43:00] and someone would ring a bell they'd all
[2:43:02] come downstairs for the service
[2:43:05] there was a young teenage girl there by
[2:43:08] the name of kathleen scott
[2:43:10] she was there praying in that upper room
[2:43:13] of the azusa mission
[2:43:15] there was a man that entered the
[2:43:16] building and hearing prayers he he went
[2:43:18] upstairs to the prayer room
[2:43:21] and the moment he entered
[2:43:23] kathleen moved by the spirit of rose and
[2:43:26] she began to point at the man as he
[2:43:28] stood at the head of the stairway
[2:43:30] and spoke in a language
[2:43:34] other than her own for several minutes
[2:43:39] then the ringing of the bell started
[2:43:40] calling the people to the preaching
[2:43:42] service he interrupted it
[2:43:44] and
[2:43:45] the man grabbed a hold of kathleen
[2:43:48] and went downstairs
[2:43:51] and waited until the order was restored
[2:43:53] in the auditorium as it was getting
[2:43:56] ready for the preaching and he testified
[2:43:58] he said i am a jew
[2:44:00] i came to this this city to investigate
[2:44:04] the speaking in tongues
[2:44:07] no person in this city knows my first or
[2:44:09] my last name
[2:44:11] and i'm here under an assumed name
[2:44:16] nobody knows my occupation or anything
[2:44:19] about me i go to hear preachers
[2:44:21] for the purpose of taking their sermons
[2:44:23] apart and using them in lecturing
[2:44:25] against christian religion
[2:44:28] but said this girl
[2:44:30] as i entered the room
[2:44:32] she started speaking in a hebrew
[2:44:34] language
[2:44:35] she told me my first name and my last
[2:44:38] name
[2:44:39] she told me why i was in the city and
[2:44:41] what my occupation was in life and
[2:44:44] called me to repent and she told me the
[2:44:46] things about my life that would be
[2:44:48] impossible for any person in this city
[2:44:50] to know
[2:44:51] and then he dropped to his knees and
[2:44:53] prayed as though his heart would break
[2:45:02] that's jesus christ the same
[2:45:09] there was a man by the name of jacob
[2:45:11] robert
[2:45:15] the jew he was a christian
[2:45:19] but a guilty one
[2:45:20] because he hid his christianity he's a
[2:45:22] rabbi
[2:45:23] he didn't want anybody to know
[2:45:25] that he believed in christ he had his
[2:45:27] deep split within himself
[2:45:31] one swelter night in 1960 of july 1960
[2:45:35] remember the healing revival still going
[2:45:37] on
[2:45:38] he's invited by my friend to the first
[2:45:41] assembly of god church in pasadena texas
[2:45:44] while that revival was in progress
[2:45:48] he was invited to go to it and he was a
[2:45:50] little reluctant to go because
[2:45:53] he was wary of their emotionalism he
[2:45:56] heard about
[2:45:57] but he agreed to go
[2:45:59] the service was a typical pentecostal
[2:46:01] service it was songs testimonies hand
[2:46:03] clapping
[2:46:04] finally a sermon
[2:46:06] and at the end of the sermon
[2:46:08] the evangelist invited anyone present
[2:46:11] who had a personal problem to come to
[2:46:13] the altar
[2:46:14] and receive prayers received the prayers
[2:46:17] of the congregation
[2:46:18] and suddenly he was this jacob he was
[2:46:22] seized with a whole longing a great
[2:46:24] longing to lay down this burden some
[2:46:26] double life
[2:46:27] he had carried so long to resolve once
[2:46:30] and for all that conflict that was in
[2:46:32] him
[2:46:34] when the preacher asked about his
[2:46:36] special need and what it was
[2:46:38] he didn't say anything he just remained
[2:46:40] silent
[2:46:42] and the
[2:46:43] evangelist said that's all right god
[2:46:44] knows your needs better than you know
[2:46:46] yourself and turn in the congregation he
[2:46:49] requested to the to the the people that
[2:46:52] come stood around him
[2:46:54] to to pray in the spirit form and at
[2:46:56] that there was several men left their
[2:46:58] seats and come to stand behind the
[2:47:00] kneeling rabbi
[2:47:02] some stood behind him some
[2:47:04] son stood by sightings a few laid their
[2:47:07] hands on his head and shoulders and
[2:47:09] others just simply bowed their heads
[2:47:11] and they began to pray and speak in
[2:47:13] simon simultaneously some was in english
[2:47:15] others was in tongues and suddenly jacob
[2:47:18] raised up from there and turned to look
[2:47:20] behind him and his cheeks were flushed
[2:47:22] and wet
[2:47:24] and he said that was beautiful
[2:47:26] which one of you is jewish
[2:47:29] he looked around said well which one of
[2:47:30] you knows me
[2:47:32] you forgive me i i don't recognize you
[2:47:35] who is it that knows me among you men
[2:47:38] here you were just talking there was
[2:47:39] still no answer
[2:47:40] the church became silent said it came
[2:47:42] right here right here from behind me is
[2:47:45] that just exactly where you're standing
[2:47:47] he said to one of the man are you jewish
[2:47:49] and he said me he said no
[2:47:51] i'm irish my name is john grubber
[2:47:54] said you speak hebrew he said
[2:47:57] no he said i
[2:47:59] i don't speak hebrews but that's the
[2:48:01] voice that's the voice right there
[2:48:04] said i don't understand a word in hebrew
[2:48:06] and he stood up and he said you were
[2:48:07] speaking hebrew right then
[2:48:09] and he told the story his voice was full
[2:48:11] of emotion
[2:48:12] he said can you imagine
[2:48:15] and and john and and jacob would say
[2:48:17] later and said can you imagine that big
[2:48:19] irishman behind me speaking the most
[2:48:21] beautiful hebrew i'd ever heard could
[2:48:23] you imagine an irishman speak in hebrew
[2:48:26] at all
[2:48:27] and he said how do you know my father's
[2:48:29] name no one in texas knew my family but
[2:48:32] here he said i've dreamed a dream and
[2:48:34] hebrews said it perfect hebrew i've
[2:48:35] dreamed a dream that you will go into
[2:48:38] the big populated places and there you
[2:48:40] will preach and there will be ones that
[2:48:42] will
[2:48:43] that have not heard will understand you
[2:48:45] because you jacob son of rabbi ezequal
[2:48:48] will come in the full fullness of the
[2:48:51] blessings of the gospel of jesus christ
[2:48:53] and the rabbi looked at us and said what
[2:48:55] do you make of that
[2:48:57] and there that man turned there from his
[2:49:00] split decision there of trying to hide
[2:49:03] as a jew and be a christian become a
[2:49:05] real christian
[2:49:09] so no it wasn't just gibberish or jabber
[2:49:11] there was real genuine speaking in
[2:49:14] tongues
[2:49:16] and the prophet of god said it's always
[2:49:18] supposed to be in the church
[2:49:25] now
[2:49:26] i just want to say if that happened in
[2:49:29] the plant
[2:49:30] while it was the shuck
[2:49:33] what about when it's in full grain
[2:49:38] i just want to say
[2:49:40] you know we think
[2:49:42] so many times oh but it's drying time
[2:49:44] now
[2:49:45] you know that just can't happen today we
[2:49:47] don't need that today that you see that
[2:49:49] was when the plant was green and we're
[2:49:52] the golden grain and all the moisture
[2:49:54] has now been baked out and we're laying
[2:49:57] in the presence of the sun and ripened
[2:50:02] and you didn't ripen you rotted
[2:50:10] that's not what that means
[2:50:14] it means all the immaturity is baked out
[2:50:19] the greenness immaturity parcel word has
[2:50:22] now given away to full word
[2:50:26] partial inheritance to full inheritance
[2:50:29] like brother branham said we now have
[2:50:31] the perfect divine interpretation of the
[2:50:33] word of god
[2:50:35] and he said and jumping up and down
[2:50:36] trying to speak with tongues is over
[2:50:38] with
[2:50:40] jumping up and down like a kid he said
[2:50:42] trying to speak in tongues is over with
[2:50:46] it's not that tongues is over with
[2:50:49] i mean goodness that's part of the word
[2:50:52] how could we leave part of the word
[2:50:54] behind
[2:50:55] it's trying to speak with tongues by
[2:50:58] jumping up and down working up an
[2:50:59] emotion you see the greenness has been
[2:51:02] baked out
[2:51:04] we do not have to have a we do not have
[2:51:08] to have a
[2:51:09] an impersonation we can have the real
[2:51:12] that impersonation is over with this is
[2:51:15] when it comes back to genuine grain
[2:51:17] again
[2:51:19] brother branham told us in the third
[2:51:21] exodus
[2:51:22] he told us he said he equated it like
[2:51:25] the brothers of joseph when they sow
[2:51:28] that dreamer down to egypt and said we
[2:51:30] won't need your visions boy we won't
[2:51:32] need your dreams yeah your dream ha ha
[2:51:35] ha you know you what what's going to
[2:51:37] come up now you're going to be a slave
[2:51:39] down in egypt we were going to kill you
[2:51:41] but we can make some money out of this
[2:51:44] we don't want prophecy we don't want
[2:51:47] speaking in tongues
[2:51:50] and he said he said you see what i mean
[2:51:52] he said i'm sure you can catch that
[2:51:54] that's a reason of it is because they
[2:51:56] thought they would never need it
[2:51:59] they thought they would never need that
[2:52:01] dreamer they'd never need the holy
[2:52:04] spirit to speak
[2:52:05] they were seed of abraham they were
[2:52:08] prosperous
[2:52:09] but they didn't know there was a famine
[2:52:12] coming they didn't know that the
[2:52:15] prophecy was still going to be fulfilled
[2:52:17] are you with me and he said that's the
[2:52:19] reason they thought they'd never need it
[2:52:20] we don't need speakers with tongues oh
[2:52:23] no this is after the seals he said we we
[2:52:26] don't need interpretation interpreters
[2:52:28] of tongue we no no longer need old
[2:52:31] testament prophets to set us in order by
[2:52:33] the holy spirit we understand it they've
[2:52:35] adopted man-made systems to take the
[2:52:38] place of the holy spirit therefore
[2:52:41] listen this
[2:52:42] therefore there are people that's
[2:52:45] elected
[2:52:47] who has their names on the lamb's book
[2:52:49] of life
[2:52:51] they can't go for that
[2:52:54] they are spiritual minded therefore they
[2:52:57] cannot go for that they cannot stand it
[2:53:00] they no matter if their fathers and
[2:53:02] mothers was lived in whatever
[2:53:03] organizational church
[2:53:07] you see
[2:53:08] brother branham in his clothes in prayer
[2:53:10] and it is rising of the sun he would
[2:53:13] pray this he would ask god to pour out
[2:53:16] the quickening power of the holy ghost
[2:53:18] upon his saying quicken their mortal
[2:53:21] bodies
[2:53:22] then we shall hear genuine new tongues
[2:53:25] powers of god
[2:53:27] love and told dying grace living grace
[2:53:31] and a resurrected christ a body of bride
[2:53:34] representing him on the earth
[2:53:37] that was brother brandon's prayer over
[2:53:39] us
[2:53:40] are you with me in in condemnation by
[2:53:44] representation again a prayer over his
[2:53:46] church in jeffersonville granted father
[2:53:49] healed the sick and afflicted bring them
[2:53:52] back to the old-fashioned revival type
[2:53:55] of the people today of people today
[2:53:57] bring them back to original pentecost
[2:53:59] bring them back to the blessing bring
[2:54:01] them back like pentecostal in a.d 33
[2:54:06] give them the pentecostal blessing may
[2:54:08] the power of god come into the church
[2:54:11] may there be divine healing gifts give
[2:54:13] to the church may there be speakers with
[2:54:16] tongues interpreters or tongues may
[2:54:19] there be gifts of prophecy and all
[2:54:21] different manifestations and not make
[2:54:24] believe or try to believe or put on but
[2:54:27] may it be real genuine coming with the
[2:54:29] word the word of god made known
[2:54:32] prophesying things that comes to pass
[2:54:36] amen let me just say it as we try to sum
[2:54:39] it up if the light that was in the stump
[2:54:42] produce justification want the seed be
[2:54:45] justified
[2:54:47] if the life that was in the apostle
[2:54:49] produced sanctification won't the seed
[2:54:52] also be holy
[2:54:54] if the light that was in the shop
[2:54:56] produced the gifts of the spirit won't
[2:54:58] the seed have the same
[2:55:01] amen how can we deny any part of this
[2:55:04] word
[2:55:05] all of the word will be summed up headed
[2:55:08] up into the grain
[2:55:10] hallelujah he speaks of this maturity
[2:55:12] and by the way he refers us all the way
[2:55:15] through his his ministry it's a
[2:55:17] scripture that is seldom preached to
[2:55:20] anymore today you hardly ever hear a
[2:55:22] message preacher refer to this scripture
[2:55:24] and brother branham did it all the way
[2:55:26] to his last sermon in 1965 and now it's
[2:55:30] an overlooked forgotten scripture
[2:55:34] now y'all sparked your curiosity long
[2:55:36] enough to kind of get your attention
[2:55:38] just before i close
[2:55:40] isaiah 28 9.
[2:55:47] whom
[2:55:48] shall he teach knowledge
[2:55:50] and whom shall he make to understand
[2:55:52] doctrine
[2:55:54] them that are weaned from the milk and
[2:55:55] drawn from the breast
[2:55:58] what's now
[2:56:00] he's going to have somebody
[2:56:02] he can teach knowledge
[2:56:05] there is a people that know their god
[2:56:08] who will do exploits
[2:56:12] amen there will be a people none of the
[2:56:14] wicked will understand but the wise
[2:56:16] shall understand
[2:56:19] you say brother tim you've been
[2:56:21] preaching about
[2:56:22] drinking from el shaddai this is totally
[2:56:24] different this is now the scripture
[2:56:26] referring to something here as
[2:56:29] immaturity
[2:56:30] and he said who shall he teach knowledge
[2:56:32] and whom shall he make to understand
[2:56:34] doctrine them
[2:56:36] that are coming to maturity if we're in
[2:56:38] the grain we should understand doctrine
[2:56:42] amen we should have received the
[2:56:44] knowledge of the truth
[2:56:47] amen for precept must be upon precept
[2:56:50] that means command that must be upon
[2:56:53] command
[2:56:54] anymore if what bible commands that a
[2:56:57] woman not to cut her hair they don't cut
[2:56:59] their hair
[2:57:00] if it commands they don't paint your
[2:57:02] face they'll paint their face
[2:57:04] if it says that a man should cut his
[2:57:07] hair he don't wear his hair long like a
[2:57:09] hippie come on somebody amen if the
[2:57:12] bible commands something if he commands
[2:57:15] me baptized in the name of jesus christ
[2:57:17] for remission of sin we obey what he
[2:57:20] said if he said you shall receive the
[2:57:22] gift of the holy ghost there's somebody
[2:57:24] going to receive it amen for command
[2:57:27] must be upon command and line or rule
[2:57:31] upon rule here a little very little
[2:57:35] hallelujah amen that's the whole gospel
[2:57:38] it comes from genesis to revelation
[2:57:41] and the whole gospel must be brought out
[2:57:44] the full gospel must begin here and they
[2:57:47] preached it and when they did the power
[2:57:48] of the holy ghost came
[2:57:50] look word upon word scripture upon
[2:57:53] scripture it almost compiled together
[2:57:56] amen oh my you see and our experience
[2:58:00] then must tie with the scripture
[2:58:02] what's now far with stammering lips
[2:58:07] another tongue
[2:58:09] will he speak to this people
[2:58:11] to whom he said
[2:58:13] this is the rest
[2:58:19] hallelujah
[2:58:20] this is what the holy ghost does
[2:58:23] this is the rest the repressing
[2:58:27] amen wherewith you may call
[2:58:30] the weary to rest and this is refreshing
[2:58:33] but they wouldn't hear it
[2:58:35] now again brother branham preaches this
[2:58:38] and brings it out even in his message
[2:58:39] communion
[2:58:41] and he said when did that happen he said
[2:58:44] when was this scripture here fulfilled
[2:58:46] seven hundred and twelve years later on
[2:58:48] the day of pentecost stammering lips set
[2:58:50] upon the people and they were filled
[2:58:52] with the holy ghost and began to speak
[2:58:53] with other tongues and the holy ghost
[2:58:55] took their lives over and they ceased
[2:58:57] from their worldly thing then they
[2:58:59] entered into a rest with christ this is
[2:59:02] the finished work hallelujah this is a
[2:59:04] seal this is the sabbath
[2:59:07] and paul applies the scripture to how
[2:59:10] the holy ghost speaks
[2:59:12] in tongues
[2:59:13] look in first corinthians 14 21 in the
[2:59:16] law it is written with men of other
[2:59:18] tongues and other lips will i speak into
[2:59:21] this people yet for all of that they
[2:59:23] will not hear me saith the lord
[2:59:24] wherefore tongues are for a sign and
[2:59:28] then he goes on he said it's a sign to
[2:59:30] them that believe not
[2:59:33] amen but nevertheless it is a sign
[2:59:36] it is there it is a it is a sign it is
[2:59:39] there with a with stamina lips and
[2:59:42] another tongue i will speak to this
[2:59:44] people
[2:59:45] again i'm showing you if god still
[2:59:48] speaks in genuine tongues no it's not
[2:59:52] the initial evidence of the holy ghost
[2:59:54] it's just one of the evidences of the
[2:59:58] holy ghost the holy ghost says many
[3:00:00] things the holy ghost is the word in the
[3:00:03] word is the power amen these signs will
[3:00:06] follow them that believe that is the sa
[3:00:08] that is the sign of a holy ghost church
[3:00:12] they will lay hands on the sick that is
[3:00:14] a sign of the holy ghost church in
[3:00:17] action amen if they will cast out devils
[3:00:20] they will have power to make satan flee
[3:00:23] that is a sign of a holy ghost church
[3:00:26] they will speak with new tongues that is
[3:00:28] a sign of a holy ghost church
[3:00:32] though it's been though it's been
[3:00:34] totally impersonated
[3:00:37] though it has been confused you today
[3:00:40] can still drink from el shaddai
[3:00:42] you still can receive from the full word
[3:00:45] of god amen there will be in this bright
[3:00:49] tongue's interpretation prophecy gifts
[3:00:52] of the spirit because it's in the word
[3:00:55] that will be word of knowledge come on
[3:00:58] amen there will be word of wisdom there
[3:01:01] will be laying hands on the sick and
[3:01:02] they shall recover there will be power
[3:01:05] abram that is laying in that drive that
[3:01:08] will be overcoming power living in his
[3:01:11] people even she will not be a powerless
[3:01:14] group of people that leave out of here
[3:01:17] but she'll be a people with genuine
[3:01:20] movement fullness of the holy ghost with
[3:01:23] full power full anointing full presence
[3:01:26] of the almighty god amen i'll tell you
[3:01:29] get ready for it because all the
[3:01:31] freeness and immaturity is going out of
[3:01:34] the church and she will produce
[3:01:36] everything that is said in this world
