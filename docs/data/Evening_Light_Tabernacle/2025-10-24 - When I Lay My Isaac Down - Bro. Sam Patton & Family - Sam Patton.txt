So when I lay my eyes down with a broken heart, but my heart is round. and all the solder where he lay just to find that it wasn't him. God wanted me. Now most of us I dare to say we've got an eyes extending in God's way. But it's on this soldier you too can prove that it's not your Isaac that God wants. Won't you lay my eyes again with a broken heart from my father's brother and on this where he lay justify It wasn't you. God won with me. Oh, to Jesus. I surrender all to him. I freely give. I will ever love and I'll trust him. His presence daily with I surrender all. I surrender all to thee my blessed savior I surrender.
