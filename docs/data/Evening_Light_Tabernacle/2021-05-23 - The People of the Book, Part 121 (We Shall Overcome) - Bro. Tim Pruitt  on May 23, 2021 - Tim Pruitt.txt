Description:
Bro. Tim Pruitt ministers on "The People of the Book, Part 121 - We Shall Overcome" on Sunday, May 23rd, 2021 at Evening Light Tabernacle. For information, service archives, and more, please visit the church website at www.eveninglight.net

We welcome you to visit us during any of our services. We believe in taking the Scriptures for what they say and presenting Jesus Christ—not only in our teachings and in our services—but , most importantly, in our lives. We believe that all Christians must have a new birth whereby their nature is changed into the very image of Christ Himself. We are living in the last space of time allotted to the Gentile age before Christ’s return. Hence, the name, Evening Light Tabernacle, for we truly are at the evening time. However, the Scriptures contain the promise that at the evening time, there shall be light

Lo invitamos a visitarnos durante cualquiera de nuestros servicios. Creemos en tomar las Escrituras por lo que dicen y presentar a Jesucristo, no solo en nuestras enseñanzas y en nuestros servicios, sino, lo más importante, en nuestras vidas. Creemos que todos los cristianos deben tener un nuevo nacimiento mediante el cual su naturaleza se transforma en la imagen misma de Cristo mismo. Estamos viviendo en el último espacio de tiempo asignado a la era de los gentiles antes del regreso de Cristo. De ahí el nombre, Evening Light Tabernacle, porque realmente estamos a la hora de la tarde. Sin embargo, las Escrituras contienen la promesa de que al anochecer habrá luz

to him may he speak back to you today father we're your children who have gathered in your name once more and it's sunday we have come on this first day of the week to honor the resurrection [Music] also it's the day 50 days after our easter which they call pentecost lord may today be a pentecost in the hearts and lives of men and women across this congregation across the world lord thou knowest every need of your people i pray that you would just speak to them to date and that they would know you're the god that's in control of every situation that there is no lack for the promises of god are sure and the word of god is a living word it's alive to bring forth what it was sent to do lord we know that it must accomplish what it's been released for and there was words that has been released for our day scripture that has been made alive that has been enlightened that light has shone on pages of the word that was written and maybe has been left in obscurity for years and years and years as men did not know its meanings but we come into a time where light is shining on the word of god and illuminating every promise from genesis to revelation and we pray lord that you'll illuminate it to our hearts today that you'll reveal yourself to us through the word we pray heal the sick among us lord those out on the internet and around the world that are in need today and they need a touch i pray that you'll touch them lord may they realize that even though they can't be in physically here in the service that by the holy spirit by the work of grace that they can enter into an atmosphere of believing where that all things are possible to them that believe i ask lord that you'll minister to every person that is here you see the guests that's in our midst today as well as those that did not get to attend for one reason or another not in the service i pray that you had blessed them all and lord we commit it in your hand i'm your servant lord i can only do as you will anoint but when the anointing comes anointing will break the yoke so break the yoke of every sin doubt and unbelief in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you if you will turn with me to daniel chapter 12 and verse 1 we actually left off on this last week as we concluded our service and trust in today that we can just um receive something from the lord we're going to be speaking today we had spoke last week on the lord is a man of war and this this week we are today we're going to be speaking on we shall overcome amen so knowing if the lord is on our side then who or what can be against us amen daniel chapter 12 and verse 1 we want to read from there today and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that should be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall will shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever but thou wilt daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased amen we'll let you have your seats you pray for me as we look into the word today i just wanted to share with you a dream that i had on this past tuesday morning i woke up to this and just bask in the presence of the lord for a while but i was dreaming that i was going to meet him somewhere where i was going to preach and i was laying out things to take and i laid out a weapon it was a custom fit gun that just fit me perfectly and you know there was someone else that said in the dream that another gun would be better but i knew that gun would shot a pattern that would hit the target and every ball of lead in it from genesis to revelation would hit the target and i was demonstrating of how i could pick this gun up and shoulder and shoot it by instinct just by sighting the barrel and i could do it better and quicker with this gun that fit me and as i was in this dream as dreams go i i said timothy and i will be taking the meetings but i'm going to be preaching from the inspiration of christ the mystery of god revealed because brother branham said if you miss it come back to this tape and and i said then i said this is the threefold purpose and i went over them to reveal himself in christ to redeem a bride and to get preeminence in his people and then to take them back to eden and i and then and i the dream continued and i said this will fulfill his other great sermon of god in the universe god in his word god and his son and then finally god and his people and this will bring them back to eden condition and i'll tell you i i believe that we're living in a very wonderful hour and a very wonderful time where we're about to turn from time back into eternity so what an hour what a day that we are in it you know even our dreams our our things that we think upon begin to reflect this and i i thought as i read this scripture this morning from daniel chapter 12 that it was a time where there was a battle but in the heavens and this would be in the earlier chapters of daniel where daniel had set his face to pray and he wanted to know exactly what god was doing in that hour of fulfilling the word of promise that had been given and so he set his face to pray and to fast and you know it was many days before he got an answer and yet um he received a finally an angel came to him that told him daniel you are greatly beloved i want you just to think of this just because that you are hanging on to promise don't give up on it amen the the message finally comes through your greatly beloved and he said i would have been here from the day you prayed but there was a battle in the heavens and this battle in the heavens delayed my coming and i would not be here except for michael the archangel came to help me and so and and so you know this sets the stage for daniel chapter 12 where that michael now is is standing up and it shows um that there has been a battle in heaven and then as he stands up where he arises he stands up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and that word stand up means to rise to come on the scene to stand forth to appear to rise against or rise up and rise against so you know it's a it's an hour where that we're living in a time of trouble as the bible said like there's never been and you can expect things to get worse and worse and worse as we face the end time but you remember it's in that hour that michael stands up and he arises and of course when he does i want you to notice that he tells us already you know the outcome of the battle and thy people shall be delivered this word delivered means they shall escape and you remember the rapture um is very much similar to the red sea that we have been preaching about where they escaped through the red sea and it closed up upon the enemy and they were on the other side and and the rapture is very much an escape up from the things that are coming up on the earth the bible said that you should pray always that you might be accounted worthy to escape the things that are coming upon the earth because he said that like a snare it shall come upon the earth and he said don't be caught with drunken and sophieting and and the cares of this life don't let that overtake you but get ready to leave from here and i think if there was ever a time that we should prepare to go forward to go through to to to meet the challenge of the hour it is now and the bible said that every one that shall be found written in the book shall be delivered so if you notice here a bible uh michael's standing up a book and everyone whose name in the written in the book shall be delivered so this this again as we was paralleling with with it last week with revelation chapter 5 and we will speak up just a little bit about that again today but i i want you just to to to kind of understand that we are here in the fulfilling of these prophecies the things that were written before time they were written for our admonition and to prepare us for the end time where we could see that god has the road map already written out in his bible now the bible said that day that be wise that means um that day that be wise shall shine and i want to just look on all of this for a moment they shall shine look they that be wise that word means to have insight wise means to have insight to have comprehension so there is a people that will actually comprehend or have revelation of what god is saying now remember this is christ the mystery of god revealed brother branham established it totally through that sermon that it is it is not a group a revelation it is not something you get from an organization it is in teachings that is passed down it is absolutely a revelation of jesus christ personally to you and so again they that be wise that has this insight that has the ears to hear what the spirit is saying that has eyes to see when the rest of the world is blinded that has comprehension because they have the mind of god that these that are wise they shall shine and that word shine means to warn to teach to shine to send out a light to be shining there as the brightness of the permanent as all the stars of the heavens and this word stars means right here the brothers of the messiah amen so we'll shine as the brothers of the messiah think about this day there's a people who will shine as abraham shown in his day as he stood out from among the heathen as isaac jacob joseph all the the men down to the bible elijah moses whoever they were the stars before us they met the sons of the messiah amen as they have shown also will the wise in this day shine as sons of the messiah they've been doing exploits in this day and then because they are the stars that shine forever and ever as brothers of the messiah now remember from last sunday that this is again the pentecost of pentecost it is the jubilee of jubilees and let me show you what god is doing at this pentecost is where he stands up and and and as an as an overcomer as a mighty conqueror as a bloody lamb notice revelation 5 shows him as the the oh hymn that has overcome death hell and the grave revelation 5 and 6 and i beheld in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain so you have daniel 12 which is michael standing up you have the lamb now standing but notice he doesn't stand as a victim he doesn't stand as one who is dead a dead lamb doesn't stand but he was slain but in his death he won a victory amen and verse 9 tells us that the the victory the lamb's victory has redeemed us to god by that blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth amen now this is what the message of god does for us as the lamb stands up notice what he does he redeems us but he makes us into our god have a dominion we reign as kings and priests and it's not just something that's going to happen in the far off or by and by way outshonder in the great future but we shall reign on the earth amen we'll reign over the flesh over sin over the devil over our own earth now so when when this message was given i want you to remember it was a declaration of war against the the established systems of the day against the satanic kingdoms it was a declaration of war that was was a trumpet call for every one of us to prepare for battle amen now remember this brother branham told us in the fifth seal the angel of god um this is first seal the angel of god catches the mystery of god not yet fully revealed and but when he does he catches the mystery of god and then goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him he goes forth to the people what does he do there he proclaims a message and what does it do what does it start it starts a war a spiritual war now remember this time this last day that we are in is a time of war and the message that you have received is a call to battle it is a trumpet call preparing yourself for battle amen now you can see it's not just in the physical but it's also in the heavenlies because again the angels themselves are there there's war in heaven amen and we're going to be looking at this this morning a little bit later in revelation 12 but right now i want you to understand that we are in a battle and we're depicted you know of uh of how we will be in this battle what the battle array will be now i want you to see him when he comes with his army to take the world over for the millennium this is going to be a future scripture but the scripture as i said does not pertain to now but when he comes back with his saints and we're talking about revelation 19 and verse 11 and he says and i saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true we heard last wednesday night on the faithful god this is him coming he is faithful and he is true and in righteousness he to judge and make war i want you to understand our god is a warrior god and he is leading us into battle this is not a time of making peace with the enemy this is a time of battle a great war a great strike there is strife in the earth there is strife in the heavens amen everywhere that you whoever where you look there is a conflict we see the forces of hell that is gathered and brother branham would tell us all hell is against this teaching so we know all of hell we can see the raid on many fronts we can see it there with the perversion of sodom we can see it there in our government in the perversion of our laws we can see it in the world condition as nations gather themselves against jerusalem and the world criticizes her even defending her own self and her territory are you with me amen there is battlefronts everywhere that you look you cannot look anywhere in this world and see that there is peace it is a time of war it is a time of great strife and i want you to understand that you know rather than being discouraged because of war i mean you should be encouraged because we are in the battle for the rapture we are in the battle for the body change we are in the battle for the greatest divine healing movement that ever struck the earth where men and women will be standing on their feet and old age will go away and they'll be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye you were in a battle for your life and you must lay hold on eternal life amen you must be persevere and persistent you must not give up you're not must not be a quitter you must not be a peacekeeper you must not allow the enemy to have one ounce of territory on any promise of god but you're gonna stand there and you're gonna resist the devil so that he will flee from you you already got the word what's going to happen when you resist he will flee from you he judges and make war judges and makes war now listen this is the word of god and i'm telling you he that rides his horse his name is called the word of god so as the word comes in any age and any time he judges and makes war he judges and makes war are you with me and his eyes was as a flame of fire we're just going to stop here just a moment let's let's just kind of uh digest some of this ruminate on it for a little bit his eyes were as a flame of fire dude did you notice last sunday we were talking about him looking through the pillar of fire when he looked through that pillar of fire and he judged the egyptians and then he declared war on him saying that your enemy that you have had the egyptians that you've seen your slave masters you will see them from this day no more amen and and so his eyes are a flame of fire so when he looks through the pillar of fire and i want you to i want you to remember and bring this connection because this is the day that we saw vividly the pillar of fire and his picture was taken in mind his his identification was their service after service and we saw what he did when he looked through the pillar of fire and when glottal looks through the pillar of fire every thought is exposed no demon can hide faith or unbelief is revealed every sin that is exposed are you with me amen like like when i i was a young boy i was in jack moore's church and like tabernacle we didn't attend there but i went to this meeting where that mr teenage america was that came to life tabernacle and his claim to fame was demonstrating his great strength by taking this report phone book which is about time at that time was about as thick as my bible his was a big book we don't have that's almost obsolete you hardly know what a phone book is anymore but anyway you know they that mr teenage america he would demonstrate his great strength before everybody by taking and tearing a shreveport phone book in two and and so i i saw him do that at live tabernacle as i said at jack morris church and then just a little later in brother branson's meetings or right about that time in the presence of the pillar of fire i want you to get this looking through that brother bradham turned to him on the platform and and he said you know about last night and he cried out oh god forgive me and brother branham said well since you've asked forgiveness i won't expose you all right amen now this was witness this is actually not on tape but it was witnessed by people that were there are you with me amen but what was it it was in the presence of the pillar of fire as brother as sister jamie camp was there in that meeting and went through the prayer line and someone a lady just before desiring a baby and brother branham said but you've got a habit that you need to get rid of and that's smoking what was it it was looking through the pillar of fire and finding the root of unbelief that with his symptoms of sin which was smoking and it was exposed so that she could be delivered are you with me and when sicknesses were exposed over and over and over again devils couldn't hide i i just went as i was reminiscing on this and thinking of it i went back and i thought of some of the prayer lines where brother bradley said i can't see some kind of room it's it's a white looking oh you were operated on and um you know you they've done something the doctors have it's caused a bowel condition isn't that right they made a mistake there but god is here to correct it you believe it satan you thought you could hide from the doctor but you can't hide from god come out of the woman in the name of jesus christ so you know it not only you know it exposed even the mistake the doctors made are you with me it showed right down into the operating room it shows that once god looks to the pillar of fire he can see every sin every fault every problem because he does judge come on and then he made war satan you thought you could hide from the doctrine and the the diseases and devils they do a pretty good job of hiding from the doctors but he said you can't hide from god come out of the woman now again you know um many times that these spirits would call out to each other i remember and i told this before but i used to preach when i was a lot younger back in the 70s early 70s in fact wayne lawson when i was in some of my meetings as a five-year-old boy and he could remember me kept me coming he said you had something on your foot brother tim said i remember that and then i had had surgeries and i was in a walking cast and i was preaching for henry darris a revival meeting and a walking cast and and so as i as i was preaching this meeting uh you know then then um brother darris shared with me a personal testimony of how that he was in uh brother branham's meetings how he went there in in the early days in jonesboro on arkansas and he was in a tent meeting and he couldn't get a seat he had cancer and it was in his throat and it had ate and eaten out the lining of his throat and and he had difficulty there swallowing and because he was looking for healing he he was came and was leading up against the tent post and standing in the meeting because he couldn't get a seat and was wanting to be close so he found a place by tentpost and was standing there leaning against it and as the meeting went on there was a lady come in the prayer line or a person came in the prayer line and they had cancer in her body and his brother branham began to discern he said wait a minute he said there's a black streak going from this woman to that man right over there she has cancer and this man has cancer and the demon in this person is calling for the demon that is afflicting this man to to come and help and congregate for unbelief and he said but satan you have been exposed so come out of them in the name of jesus christ and henry darris was healed in that meeting because again god was looking through the pillar of fire calling things what they were now you see again i'm this is from one of the prayer lines brother brandon said moving up close to me now is comes the spirit of death it's black it's hideous the veil is parting back i see a woman examined is a cancer and it's come to take your life but jesus christ come to give you life and when who who do you believe tonight the lord jesus ever cancer suffer in the building stand to their feet at this time for the defeat of one of the arch enemies of the human race will you stand your feet doubt demon called cancer you might hide from the doctrine but you can't hide from god you're exposed come out of these people in the name of jesus christ you are defeated what was we showing we were showing a warrior god at work because in a time of trouble amen in a time when doctors can't do anything about it and then here he comes on the scene he stands up on the behalf of his people and don't keep this back in the past bring this right down to this building this morning or wherever you are sitting or staying at at this moment bring it right down to your pew or to your chair and remember there's a living god who is bringing that battle right down to your pew and then to defeat your enemy to overcome we shall not be defeated but we shall overcome [Applause] hallelujah the healing line brother branham said he talked to a man as he would often do it do and he said you know there's nothing i could do to help you in the way of healing you look like a good strong man to me but perhaps you're not i don't know but our lord jesus knows and he knows me and and if you believe that he's here his presence is here you believe he's here and then he said it's a cancerous condition now wait a minute the obvious signs on the outside was a healthy man but here when the pillar of fire looks at it he sees more than a healthy man he sees a demon hiding there a cancer's condition and then he points out to the audience and he says that man sitting right there has the same thing and these demons are screaming one to another for pity for mercy they're calling and so is the angel of god calling and the battle is here and now your faith will determine which way it goes and that's exactly the way it is in the battle your faith you decide you can decide this morning amen you can decide this is a day i'm gonna walk in freedom this is the day i'm gonna have my deliverance this is the day i'll have victory in my family this is the day the enemy stops right here the decision is yours amen now speaking to another he says brother coming with you comes a black spirit which is death it's a devil cancer there's a lady sitting there also with a cancer a cancer on the pelvic bone and i hear somebody your name is mrs roy zekes or zuke or zekes or something like that isn't that right now listen he's here and he's trying to catch what has been said i hear this said and he said isn't that right wave your hand that's right now the devil's pulling between you and it's off of both of you now it's light between you now go believing with all your heart amen what happened the pillar of fire stood between them this is exactly what happened with egypt and his throat the pillar of fire was between him all night amen the pillar of fire can come and stand between you remember the song of all the fire about me i have nothing now to fear amen again another one he said satan lost that bible hallelujah those that did the devil calls one to another they're screaming and calling for help that's the reason i called for your prayer pray for me help keep praying you see it's a power it's a battle it's the devil fighting wrong fighting against right right against wrong quit being a skeptic believe with all your heart be expecting to be next amen the holy spirit is healing all through the building being expecting to be next that ought to be your expectation this morning i'm next in line my number's being called this is my moment amen come on wake up your neighbor this morning not preaching the sleeping virgin i'm preaching to the bride of christ amen be expected to be next now what the outcome of that is i know not i know the thing left them there's a dart there was a dark streak between them and this one calling for mercy listen he could hear them saying help help help keep him from believing keep him from believing and i looked down to see where it was and i seen the woman and i've seen another woman calling her and i don't know what it was calling something another i couldn't make it out just right and that dark streak all left and it turned light and the holy spirit was moving between them the light the life of it left have faith hallelujah isn't it time that there be a people of faith oh that god would come to evening like tabernacle and find what he's looking for when the son of man cometh will i find somebody who will believe again i want to just bring this out because it shows not only the the disease but the sin many times he would say i see a black shadow but i see a darker shadow you're not a christian and the greater than solomon is here this is a 61 sermon he said i suppose we're strangers to one another you know how brother branham often did the lord jesus can reveal to me what your trouble is will you believe me i hate to tell you this you want me to tell you anyhow you're shadowed cancer you're shattered to death you had some habits to give up that you've got to give up that's right will you do it let me show you i feel another spirit coming in the devil you're trying to get right with god now here this person's trying to get right with god he said frankly you just got baptized to get straight so he's already making steps toward it but again a dark shadow was still over them and they still had habits to give up you see again the light is shining the eyes as a flame of fire this is also described in revelation chapter one his eyes are as a flame of fire this is what we have seen him as in this generation amen he not only sees the sins and diseases of the people but he sees the sins and the diseases of the church who was steeped in unbelief and darkness of creeds and darkness and was able to discern the unbelief to bring us back to faith again and he said let me show you something i feel another spirit in in here you're trying to get right with god frankly you've just been baptized that lady there and he points to the congregation will you be with leukemia you believe jesus christ will make you well if you have faith he will do you you accept it you believe he'll heal you and make you well if you've got a prayer card and she said no and he said you don't well it's a cancer too sister you don't have to have a prayer card raise up your hand to christ and say the lady's sitting there with a little red coat laying across their laps don't you see that light hanging over that woman i want to ask you something you be honest with me when i spoke cancer and death something strange happened to you is that right you had a funny feeling like come over you is that right if that's right then wave your hands to the people see it's death too on that woman it's leukemia or that's what the doctor said and he's right and you both are under the shadows of death this dar that dark streak coming from this one what is it it's a that devil in here that's called cancer cancer's a medical word means a crab but it's a devil it's a killer it's a tormentor is on this man and in that woman and he was calling for help to try to get this man to disbelieve it and the holy spirit beat him to it and threw faith on the woman and she touched something and the devil thought he could get by with it but when you both believe on jesus christ and accept him as your healer then in the name of jesus christ i condemn that devil to leave you both and you go and be well in the name of jesus christ what was it again god looking through the pillar of fire discerning the hearts even what the doctor said and the doctor said it's leukemia but then he said and he's right now you see again this is this is something that we got to understand church that we're living in a day in a time where that god has turned the fire and looking at his enemy he is seeing the enemy now as for what he really is it's a time where he dresses as the avenger as he starts to finish his redemption work oh brother i can't wait till the day he looks on our bodies and he avenges us of every gray hair of every false teeth of every eye trouble come on of every joint problem and man as he changes us from mortal to immortality i can't wait because we're living in a time the pillar of fire is about to direct its attention right on mortality itself are you with me amen now so you see the this is this is where that there is a battle that is going on every service was a battle every service you come to is a battle you're going to be battle against unbelief you're going to be battle against thoughts you're going to be battling against a sleepy devil you know you're going to be battling against the tiredness of this age and the weariness of your flesh you're going to be battling you're going to be battling on every front but i want you to remember we shall overcome and remember because we're not in this battle alone i guarantee you if you start praying right in your seat right now god come to my side amen let me see you in your power come to my pew right now and you seek god come in a miraculous way to touch your heart to change your life to change situations now satan hates to be exposed and that's why when you have two books in the bible the book of genesis and the book of revelation that those two books exposes the devil amen more than any other books in the bible and satan hates them he hates genesis he tries his best to to do everything he can to discredit it amen to say it isn't right to question the creation to question the god of creation amen you know i i i heard i i read the other day where somebody said who wants to believe in some phony belief if you eat a fruit from a magic tree and all men die well i understand their pain who doesn't want to believe that it's not a magic fruit it was sin in the garden and but it's been exposed all the fairy tales come on and mythology that tried to attach itself to the book has been exposed and now we know what the real sin in the garden was amen now again again you see again the reason he hates genesis and revelation is because both of them expose it it shows his beginning and it shows us in and i'm reading i'm going to be reading in revelation 12 in a minute which shows you the casting down of satan because it shows his defeat amen you are a people that already know the outcome of the battle before you go in there but that wasn't unique to you this is what he told israel amen i give you that land amen it's a good land and you will drive them out and i'm gonna go before you and i will lead you in the battle amen and you will drive them out i've given you this land they already know that victory is theirs before they even fight the first fight are you with me but unbelief would keep them from the promise they would take the promise and not mix it with faith and this would keep them out of the divine promise now remember when the church disbelieves satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the gates of hell cannot prevail against her that's why that god does these things in this day revelation revelation revealing the thoughts revealing the hearts revealing the word if you can have confidence that he knows the heart that he knows the thought that he can judge the sin that he can tell the diseases that he can call the name if you can have confidence that he knows the address then you surely got to have confidence he knows his word and his word is even more vital importance to be revealed to the people at the end time than the problem you have in your life amen so so again you know even when names are called and diseases revealed satan hates it and that's one thing you know satan is doing everything he can to undermine the revelation and the authority of the word he's doing everything he can to get you to doubt to bring confusion amen but but now notice again you know you know he it can discern diseases it can expose the devil remember what about faith can't the holy spirit recognize faith you know when god looks to the eyes of the pillar of fire can he tell that you are a believer he could tell that some were sinners i mean he could tell what their disease was he could tell their habits some of them he would have to move away from the microphone and say you know i remember and as i was with moses he talks to betty daughtery and and she had been healed in an earlier meeting now she's a grown woman that was when she's a child now she's a grown woman and something had come up and he pulled her aside he said are you living for god betty is everything right between you and he pulls her aside i don't know what he tells her but her heart is exposed he says i want to look deep down in your soul now you know this this is when hypocrisy and hypocrites and the facade is all stripped away and you're naked exposed now wait a minute brother branham told us we're one of the last things he says in the message communion when the last sermon he leaves us just like jesus took communion with his disciples went to the cross went to his death brother branham takes communion and goes to his death and the last sermon in communion he comes right down to it and he says church there's going to be an anonymous sapphire repeat sin is not going to be allowed to stay in the presence of believers a day when playing church is over with hiding sin and the pew under the cloak of religion amen when god looks through those eyes of the pillar of our can he tell that you are a believer as brother branham said you know and i'm just going to go through some of these for a moment just to kind of show you he says in the prayer line you are a christian believer because your spirit feels so welcome and i know this is the holy spirit here and i know it welcomes you hallelujah think about that you welcomed by the holy spirit amen inviting you into his presence i suppose we're strange with each other we don't know one another but you're a believer i can tell just as soon as you come here your faith is welcoming to me and i know you're a christian again i perceive now you're a christian because your spirit feels welcome and i know it's a christian spirit in you and god knows all about you isn't that right she's feeling the presence of his being which is going to her she's a christian a believer a spirit-filled christian and she's believing and that's why she's feeling the operation of that being standing near her is that right lady you're a believer that is right because your spirit is welcome the angel of the lord which is now on both of us is making me see your spirit is welcoming amen no wonder he comes when two or more gather in his name because they welcome him they invite him they want him they're calling through night to me come to me oppressor savior evan come to me again he said as soon as i go to talk and i find out one thing about you you're a christian believer you're a christian because your spirit is welcome and i feel the anointing of the holy spirit that you're a born-again believer that's right because your spirit feels welcome to the angel of the lord my goodness amen a people who he feels welcome with don't you want to be that kind of person that you just welcome him you invite him he he just he feels at home with you again he said he said to a lady he said you believe with all your heart only if your faith in jesus can help your sister he said reason i regard your sister because you're a believer and you're a christian if it wasn't your spirit would be moving back being dark around you but it turns light you're a believer and your spirit is welcomed by the spirit that's anointed me if you was in a christian if you wasn't a believer you would be your spirit would be moving back i wonder sometimes what is happening when people recoil and draw back when the word of god is preached maybe on holiness it may be on things you don't like to hear but it's the word of god and you recall back amen if your spirit moving back you're but but you are a believer because it turns light in other words he says he said now god knows us both sister and he said i hesitated about sister for a minute to say that but i realize now you are it's the first thing you know that you're christian because as soon as i caught your spirit it come in like that you as a christian your spirit was welcome if it kept turning dark and cloudy i know you wasn't and therefore i wouldn't have called you my sister said like philip said to nathanael when he's called up and jesus said behold an israelite a believer in whom there's no guile how do i know you as an israelite a true believer that's the same spirit the woman could have been a rank sinner but i know she's a christian because the first thing her spirit when this anointing that's here now it caught right quick you see i see it was a christian and it made it welcome you see it didn't doubt and disbelieve it made it welcome amen now you know we're all prone to skepticism is that right amen we're prone to question we're prone to you know to to even doubt i hear brother branham's praying often god forgive me in my unbelief we all struggle with it it's part of our human makeup it's our unconverted part but there's something on the inside of us that calls us to believe is that right amen even when we don't understand even when we say well to whom could we go we don't have any other place to go there's a lot of the skeptics out there today you know that say that bring all of their accusations against the prophet and his message and they and they got all their reasons and their thoughts all lined up as to why brother branham is not a true prophet and you know and sometimes you seem like you don't even know what to say to them and i don't care if we don't have an answer we believe anyhow where are we believing from not from up here we may not understand that here we understand it here we know only god can do these things and beside all of that you know what have you got that is better than what i got where are you going to take me what kind of path of sin am i going to go down just like i told a bunch of them that broke me the other day and i said go drink your beers and go wear your shorts and laugh your way to hell but i ain't going your direction i know in whom i have believed amen i am persuaded amen i'm persuaded that he that knows the heart he that discerns a heart he that time after time was never wrong and he was never wrong oh man and it comes and it's never wrong you say oh brother jim this never happened only you know this this isn't even scientific i don't care if it's the first time ever it ever happened it's never wrong now but as i was saying that my father-in-law jerome butts we called him love it some people did that's his middle name his mother was a lovett and he was named after his mother's family so love it but he was a young i call him a young man you know these men they were they have sojourned among us they were believers just like us they just ran out of time but a meeting there in in mississippi where that he where brother branham was preaching in mississippi and he drove over to the meeting and brother branham was saying some things and and whatever and he said i sat there and he said i i kind of was a skeptic and i said you know i didn't say it out loud i just thought it you know that that ain't right that can't be true and he said something hit me right in the stomach he said when it did he said i turned from my unbelief right then and i embraced it i knew it was right because the holy spirit witnessed it back to me amen now again you know there there it is again you know some of us come to place is there anything good can come out of nazareth but then we come back around and say we may not put it together we may not understand why he's from nazareth and not from bethlehem we may not have all the facts we cannot go back to history we can't talk to his mother but we know this he's the messiah we can't explain everything but we know it's the truth amen because why we saw him look through the pillar of fire and there was something in you that welcome notice now said i see your christian is turning real light around you that means your spirit is welcoming me he said can't you see that people me and the woman the light moving whipping around that holy spirit you don't see it perhaps yourself but in your spirit you know it's there you don't see it perhaps but in your spirit let you know it's there now that's the thing that heals you not me it's your faith in him i want to get just a couple of these he says to this this another woman i said i i he said sister looked this way he said i called you sister when i looked around i had my back turn you but i felt the spirit on you that you're christian you're a believer i don't know you but i know you're a christian because the spirit that's on you and the spirit that's on me is a relative and you just feel like you're welcome you know you're just making it feel good you're welcome the spirit that's on you and the spirit of me is a relative hallelujah well isn't that right every one of you born of the spirit of god your sister your brother more than that you're a daughter or son of god amen you're a relative oh my oh let me get this one he says he said um i this lady is a stranger to me we are strangers to each other but the lord jesus knows us both it's a perfect picture here's a picture of saint john four a colored woman a white man that day there was a samaritan and a jew two races of people jesus let her know quickly there was no difference we're all god's creatures the country we live in changing our color has nothing to do with it the god wanted his people that way he made man white black black brown yellow red he made them all that way that's his business and he loves us all what a great thing amen but here here's a perfect picture two people that's never met before in our first time two different races and i perceive that you are a believer you are a christian because your spirit is welcome and that great angel of god would not welcome nothing that was wrong certainly not you see that picture there that angel on that picture that light up above that where i'm standing and this is what makes you feel the way that you're feeling now just coming down over you the woman is a christian because from her comes a feeling of friendship her spirit is in that's in her is welcoming the spirit that is in me your welcome spirit is vibrating warmly your spirit has begun to witness to me you're a christian it feels welcome if it wasn't to be pushed away you ever notice when sinners come and things that see uh how it pushes away from them like that is it'll just right now it'll tell them you're a sinner you do such and such or you do so and so we're man and you're a woman and he said with the spirit you're a christian i can feel the vibration there with your spirit you know it's just moving and i know you're not a hitchhiker and he says you're a christian and he said now what i mean a hitchhiker is just jump from place to place in other words someone a hitchhiker is someone who for a little rides a little while with you and gets off before you reach the destination is that right they're just along for the ride and it's as soon as you find out what he thinks is a flaw in the message he gets off is that right amen that's a hitchhiker people who are not fully christian are hitchhikers they just along for the ride they're just taking up space in a church amen they're not going the same place they're just going along for a few weeks a few months sometimes a few years sometimes for years but at some point they're going to get off because they never ever really sold out their hitchhikers every man you know he said but you're born again you're a real christian i can feel your welcome and the holy spirit here welcomes that spirit because it's a kindred spirit and we're brother and sister i say church why don't we be real we got enough hitchhikers we got enough hitchhikers along the way amen people that are just going along for the ride for a little while but they're not completely sold out i mean they won't give their all they won't give everything and god sees it he knows your attitude toward the word he knows your attitude toward tithing he knows that you just think that tithing is an old testament scripture when jesus placed it in the new and he said these things you ought to have done and not let the others undone you miss it when that that you're not paying to a man or to a church but you're paying tithes to melchizedek to eternal priesthood and god recognizes it you failed to forget what god established in his word because you're just a hitchhiker you've never been sold out to god never surrendered your life to him so you hold things back like ananias and sapphira where they held back portions that belong to god are you with me amen but i want you to know that god's calling a people today that are not hitchhikers they're just not along the way for a little ride they're in for the journey we're going in a rapture we're going to the marriage supper the lamb we will be in the millennium we will come back with him come on somebody and we will ride amen in victory all the way everywhere every step of the way and the bible said and on his head were many crowns i spent a long time on those eyes but i want you just to get it on his head were many crowns you see abraham's victory was his victory moses victory was his victory am i down to the ages that wasn't their victory therefore that crown really didn't belong to them it belonged to him and on his head was many crowns because he had many victories he overcome oh hallelujah he overcome an abel's day can i preach just for a moment he preached if i preach on this a minute that he overcome in abel's day when it was a time of darkness when sin had entered in and mortality now had cursed the human race and and darkness was there holding the people back but i want you to remember in that time there was a man who got a revelation he got a revelation that it was not fruits but it was blood that took him out of the garden come on church and he did what he comes back and he offers a lamb as a substitute a living breathing animal and he kills him there that there will be something die in my place and he offers back to god blood and he cuts a hole through the darkness in that hour hallelujah as an overcomer in his day i want you to know god has never had an age where he didn't have overcomers never never never has he ever had an age where he didn't have overcomers [Applause] and man enables jay he took the sword of that word i don't know how he did it darkness was all around myths was so great satan's kingdom was established on the earth being was gone from them and they didn't even know they wasn't hearing from god anymore but here in this moment he believed and by faith he began to cut through the darkness and he cut through the darkness and he cut through the darkness until he saw calvary he saw the land of a slain before the foundation of the world and he cut his way through that darkness and he come back and he offered a sacrifice hallelujah why because god is determined in every age to have an overcomer amen brother braddon would preach the sermon what is that in thine hand amen because what is it you know it's a step that's in your hand how are you gonna whip egypt with a stick well i'll tell you god has always done it in every age he's always had somebody that would overcome in his day that would defeat the devil in his time come on his people has always been conquerors because why he has many crowns he has many crowds i'm talking about this one that's coming let me just read the scripture just for a minute give me now then the next verse because he's here he had a name that was written that no man knew but he that received but he that knew it or received it now and he had a vesture dipped in blood in his name is called the word of god next verse give me the and the armies in heaven which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean amen i want to depict exactly who you are we're talking about now where the pillar of fire places you the armies follow him i want you to know there's never been an age that people overcame by themselves it was every one of them by a personal revelation remember as he says in hebrews 11 by faith by faith by faith this is why the satanic attack is on the personal experience with god that every person must have if you get you to trade that for just a little um social gathering a joining of a club or belonging to a society of a church or saying you believe a confession of faith without an action of revelation remember because only revelation will defeat the devil come on church amen the word of god is absolutely of no use to anybody unless it's held in the hand of faith the bible said of them with israel and the word the word did not profit them because it was not mixed with faith in them that heard it is that right so again he has many crowns amen my goodness here's a man we just take him for a moment his name is enoch the bible said enoch walked with god and was not the world has his astronauts the world is sending vehicles to mars but they're not the first we had a was not in space long before there was an astronaut is that right and then it started with a man walking with god you say brother tim it's impossible for there to be a rapture in this last day enoch shows us it's not impossible when the sons of god were taken daughters of men enoch was walking with god you say i can't overcome this pornography i can't overcome the sins of this age i'm trying to tell you right now it ain't dead but you say but my failures brother to my past it's weighing me down and i've had my past and my past has been a sinful past and you know over and over i fight against this path and i fight against this path and either live 365 days or years it meant 365 years amen but he only what with god 300 so enoch had a path and he still took a rapture he still walked with god and he still took territory he still took one step at a time he didn't stop in his experience oh backslidden bus back church member here today who is vaccine in your in your experience you don't have to be like that and then you can be an enoch you can be a dedicated and that's what his name is dedicated i am dedicated to a rapture i'm dedicated with walking with god i'm dedicating him taking another step some of you stop at justification some of you stop at sanctification some of you stop at one place another why don't you go all the way you say my brother it's him i've got the baptism of the holy ghost then keep on going keep on walking have an adventure with god go to another exploit take another land expand your border take another step don't stay where you are don't be stacking they'll be lukewarm you gotta move this is no stopping place they ought to see it is not a stopping place oh man this last age is not a stopping place amen you've got to put another step forward you're an overcomer you took this land then you take another you took this promise you take another you take that promise you take another you keep on walking with god you keep on walking [Applause] hallelujah amen i'll tell you what if i were you sitting where i was sitting this morning i'd be welcoming the holy spirit by responding back to him saying amen that's the truth that's nothing but the truth i'd be a hatty right sitting out there in my pew saying that's the truth brother tim i'm taking another step today i'm moving a little higher i'm having a greater experience i'm going to have greater joy i've had joys before i'm going to have greater joy i've had peace before i'm going to have greater peace i've had victory before i'm gonna have greater victory i'm not stopping where i am i'm not turning around i am not quitting i am not giving up ground i am not retreating i am going forward my name is zena i'm the seventh from the second adam hallelujah amen i will shine as the stars in heaven amen i am a son of messiah and it's a sign of the messiah outside for the light that in the time of darkness i can prove light to his end-time people hallelujah you are not sons of darkness you are not children of darkness you are children of the light sons of the messiah this is what he said in daniel 12 that we will shine as the permanent forever that means we will shine as the stars he says i look back to this another star in the days of noah and in noah's day amen noah found grace in the sight of the lord amen his weapon of faith his revelation gave him an escape amen come on church in each way they all are speaking of the sons of god in the last day as brother branham would say in christ's mystery that christ is revealed in every portion of the scripture that every event every character all the way down to the ages has been speaking of this hour it's been prophesied of you so noah would prophesy of you it might build an ark it's going to rain but it ain't never rain well the world's going to burn with fire but it's never burned with fire it doesn't matter whether it's never been this may be a new thing but it's going to happen because the word of god can never fail in every age it overcomes hallelujah and what did noah do noah took there and he built an ark he built it there there in three different levels he took wood that was impossible to float it's impossible for you to make a rapture a man that you're just a human how are you going to do it porous humanity porous wood go for wood it'll soak up all of the waters it won't float it's going to sink amen but take an evergreen tree and cut it down and take the light out of the evergreen and put it in the wood hallelujah at calgary he was cut down for us his light was poured out and when it was poured out he was poured out into porous humanity [Music] hallelujah somebody that could soak it in that's what god hey you know what it was you when you was just a little boy or girl you soaked in the wrong kind of music you soaked in sin you soaked in unbelief you soaked it up everywhere you know everything of sin you soaked you soaked you soaked amen because god made you to soak but you were just soaking the wrong kind of life amen but that day when you met jesus amen you that he gave you a revelation of why you were so thirsty why was you such a thirsty woman all the time well i lived and i had this husband and then i had another and then i had a child out of wedlock and then i had this problem you were soaking it all up because you were a thirsty woman hallelujah like the woman at the well you were a thirsty woman but you found the one who can provide the river of life who can satisfy the curse in the human soul [Music] hallelujah so then he soaks up that wood with that life of the evergreen eternal life and it makes a hard wood now it's going to go in the ark but i'll tell you how i want it done i want it like this i want it but built in three levels you're gonna have three different floors and man three different levels you're gonna have justification you're gonna have sanctification you're gonna have the baptism of the holy ghost where the heavens is open there and you and god fellowship and i guarantee you no matter what kind of waters you go through hallelujah amen you're going to make it to the dry land no matter what kind of trouble's there come on you're going to make it through cause god hey he didn't tell you to build an ark to seek you he didn't give you the holy ghost to leave you behind amen he didn't send an angel with a pillow fire to abandon the bride and leave her in an awful condition no sir in every age god had overcomers it didn't matter where it was if it was just a stick that's right as i quoted a while ago when when he was going to go fight with with israel commissioner to as an israeli to fight with the egyptians moses being sent back to egypt and pharaoh and he said what do you got in your hand well i got a rod i'm going to use that rod to defeat the devil with amen that rod will turn to a serpent and he will swallow up all the other serpents say brother them thy type don't even fit yes it does jesus became sin for you amen to swallow up all the other sins [Music] and there's not a sin that he didn't conquer come on he became sin he became flesh he came in the likeness of a sinful man to pay the price of redemption for you and at that age he had an overcomer well what about your age ain't he going to have overcomers now so everywhere down to the ages it doesn't matter who it was if it's paul he could stand at the end and say i fought a good fight i was not a quitter because i kept the faith come on when the church was against me when my brothers was against me when i was in perils was i was a you know we want complaint we want to complain about what we're going through why don't you just look at the apostle paul beaten with stripes three times beat him until one more would have taken his life stoned let down a wall of the city escape in a basket in perils and see in perils on the line in perils and false brethren the man was in trouble everywhere he went trouble come everywhere he came i want to say it this way though the the devil was in trouble everywhere paul went [Applause] and that's the way it's got to be with you the devil's got to be in trouble we've got to make up our minds that the devil is the one in trouble i am not letting nothing separate me amen i'm not letting nothing drive me out i'm not letting anything take me away from the word and obedience to the word [Applause] some of you will go back through things in your past where you made an awful mistake and you know god will bring you right back to that same awful mistake and let you repeat it so that this time you can do it right because you're going to overcome you're not just going to be passed brother tim you're in the wall why are we going through what we're going it's a battle amen and you're equipped for this battle in fact to the matter you're not even leading the battle one has already went before you look way up ahead amen right up there well you know way way there at calvary what happened there he defeated every bit of it he showed you no matter what you're going through it can be overcome not because i'm that strong macho man you know i can control what my parents couldn't control my parents my family had anger they had temper problems they had this and i can handle it you can't handle it you cannot handle it not as a human but if you'll get born again you'll step over into a new race and in that new race you'll have a power that is in you that will overcome the devil amen you said but my family's had hot passing my grandma she was a prostitute literally brother tim she did this and she did that she couldn't keep her skirts down she was an awful person and that sex spirit has just followed my family right on down it stops here it stops here amen not because that i'm another human born in that line and i'm going to stop it but because greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world because i have come to be a cycle breaker a devil defeater i have come to be an overcomer i didn't come here to be defeated i didn't come here to back down i didn't come to this age for this age and this lukewarmness to overtake me and give me an apathy i have come here to win i have come here to battle i come here to draw my sword i have to come here to face that enemy and one of you will chase a thousand and two of you will chase ten thousand amen because why he's in you he's in his church he's in his people he's that overcomer and he's here this morning to be that overcomer in your life hallelujah hallelujah stand here be the worst of god and whatever you sustained that mountain be thou removed to be thou camps in the sea and shall not doubt in your heart but believe that those things that you said shall come to pass you will have whatsoever you have asked because he promises amen i say take your mountain this morning i say take your promise walk in that victory [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah the redeemed ought to be saying so amen that's right it's nothing but the truth [Applause] i'm welcoming his spirit i'm repulsing sin and unbelief let the musicians come what is it he turned the heart of us i was born wrong to begin with amen i was like a magnet there within my heart and i had two poles one that pulled and one that was resistant i was born in sin resisting the truth pushing back and pushing back i was one of those that brother brandon described pushed back and pushed back i was a sinner i pushed him away well i wouldn't come to an altar i pushed him away where i said it could be another time i pushed him away with my excuses but one day brother he came into my life and he turned my heart amen now where i was once pulled by sin now i'm told by god i'm called into his presence i pull that killer of fire i pull this present right to me because i am a son or daughter of god we shall over we shall triumph the trumpet sounds prepare for battle you can't see it maybe you've never seen inside but inside this door every time i step down to this pulpit i look at this sign and i'm reminded you have been anointed to tear satan's kingdom down [Applause] [Music] i'm opening the door of that promise to you this morning and i'm saying not only are you am i anointed but you are knowing that you are knighted just tear it down satan your kingdom is coming down don't settle for nothing but victory don't settle but nothing but the promise to be fulfilled you

and for this truth i'll tell you what if you ever if you ever let go if you ever start burning down i'm going to take a club to you and beat you in i ain't never had to worry about that club i feel like old caleb this morning amen he said i'm as strong today as i was back then and i didn't want to say i'm a stronger greater preacher than what i was i'm a born devil defeater i've got more battle

the one that said it but he said you're gonna die with this sickness i say it's worth fighting for i have not come this far to fail i have come to win because i am an overcomer [Music] you know why i've got my eye on the throne david could fight goliath even more when he learned what would be done for the man who killed goliath what will be done for him he could fight even with greater tenacity and boldness because he knew with the winning of this battle he would get the king's daughter and jesus and jesus yes amen when he went to the cross he despised the shame because he had one thing on his mind he was going to get the king's daughter for a bride by whipping this devil [Music] you are his trophy you are his trophy and you think he's gonna let his trophy be destroyed now you will
