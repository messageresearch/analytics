[10:07] him together in prayer
[10:10] there's nothing like his touch have you
[10:14] experienced his touch in your life this
[10:16] morning once you've experienced that you
[10:18] can never be the same and once he moves
[10:21] in a situation it'll never be the same
[10:23] so we're gonna ask him to move for these
[10:26] needs and that these people that we
[10:28] heard about over the these requests that
[10:30] they'll experience his touch today and
[10:33] for this service I know there's many
[10:35] needs right here in this building I have
[10:36] needs and I'm saying Lord touch me today
[10:40] touch me today I know he will let's go
[10:42] to prayer gracious father Lord how we
[10:46] longed for your touch Lord we've
[10:48] experienced it many times or where you'd
[10:50] move on the scene and situations that
[10:52] seem hopeless nor God times when we're
[10:55] sick or times when we're down and that
[10:57] the touch comes from the Almighty God
[10:59] Norden that touch makes all the
[11:01] difference in the world Lord Lorne we've
[11:04] gathered here today Lord God just to
[11:07] worship You Lord to God and to lift up
[11:09] your name because you're worthy Lord of
[11:11] all praise and honor and glory Lord God
[11:14] and we're expecting Lord God that as we
[11:17] do that and as your presence begins to
[11:19] move that each and every one in this
[11:20] building a bill to say somebody touched
[11:23] me Lord that's our desire this morning
[11:26] or we didn't gather here this morning to
[11:28] see one another Lord even though we love
[11:30] our brothers and sisters Lord that's not
[11:32] why we're here nor we didn't gather in
[11:35] Lord God just to just to hear good good
[11:37] singing and in music although we're
[11:39] thankful for all those things Lord today
[11:41] we've gathered to be touched by the hand
[11:43] of Almighty God nor we've gathered today
[11:45] Lord to hear from heaven Lord in order

[45:54] ministering a little church there and
[45:56] brother Eric reeks and and hooves
[45:59] driving left is driving home on Monday
[46:02] morning and just came really strong on
[46:04] my heart to call my father and talk to
[46:07] him about things and about brother Ron
[46:10] in the situation that was taking place
[46:12] there and to tell him you know we just
[46:14] had made the decision not to go to Japan
[46:16] and to the Philippines that right now
[46:19] has been postponed actually it's not
[46:21] canceled but postponed till June so I'll
[46:26] just be praying about that the first of
[46:27] June we're looking to go there still and
[46:30] we're just believing brother Ron's gonna
[46:32] go with us amen that's the kind of god I
[46:35] serve a man and so but Monday morning
[46:40] really feeling the urge and the unction
[46:42] to tell him that I you know I really
[46:44] felt he needed to go be with brother on
[46:47] this weekend and and he would soon
[46:50] thereafter decide to go and to buy
[46:52] tickets to go and and they arrived there
[46:55] on Thursday morning they left out right
[47:00] after you know the Wednesday Thursday
[47:01] left out to go there it was to be a
[47:05] surprise for brother Ron nobody was I
[47:07] think the whole world seemed to know but
[47:09] he didn't know somehow but anyway was
[47:11] able to keep it that way and but he did
[47:13] wake up I think on Monday or Tuesday
[47:15] brother I think it was Tuesday brother
[47:18] Andrew texted me said this guy he said
[47:20] he'd come up this morning told me said I
[47:22] really feel like some of my friends are
[47:24] about to come see me and so he had he
[47:26] kind of had a little unction there
[47:28] himself but you know as they would they
[47:30] would come to the
[47:32] Airport to meet them that was just a
[47:35] very emotional moment as you can imagine
[47:37] he had been getting a lot of bad news in
[47:41] the last few weeks just every week and
[47:43] but they would they would go there to
[47:45] the to the airport and meet my father
[47:48] and sister Karen and they would have a
[47:51] quiet embrace and a moment there
[47:53] together as brother ron was just
[47:57] overwhelmed by what was taking place and
[48:01] he had actually got up that morning and
[48:03] and just as he would pray he would said
[48:05] lord I need a boost I need I need
[48:08] something today that just because he
[48:10] just kept getting bad news after bad
[48:12] news and and he said while what a boost
[48:14] he said when your buddy comes to see you
[48:17] like that and then they would they would
[48:18] get in the car and go home and go to
[48:20] brother Ron's and and the brother there
[48:23] one of the nephews of brother Ron I
[48:25] believe it is or actually sister Connie
[48:28] had opened the door and when they walked
[48:31] in he had let brother Donnie and sister
[48:33] Carol in there so they was in the house
[48:35] waiting on them and they begin to talk
[48:38] about the things of God and God came on
[48:40] the scene and just came into the place
[48:42] and they knelt down and prayed and
[48:44] cursed that devil and I believe the
[48:48] healing is taking place even now a man
[48:59] we got this from Billy Ron today he said
[49:03] this week the doctors have declared that
[49:06] mast mast melanoma cancer is in the
[49:09] lymph nodes in both lungs they're
[49:12] surgical biopsy two different procedures

[49:19] treatments treatment recommendations but
[49:22] he said here's God's report on Thursday
[49:25] morning I got down on my knees and I

[49:30] news each week worse and worse but God
[49:34] was already on the move brother Joe
[49:36] Greene was able to come to every surgery

[51:23] three classes I had dear my graduate
[51:26] studies he's a philosopher and has
[51:29] always said you must have scientific
[51:31] evidence to prove anything but the
[51:34] dissertation for English literature had
[51:37] already been accepted I was very
[51:38] thankful and we had year-in-review on
[51:40] Monday and Tuesday and I shared with him
[51:43] that contrary to many opinions the
[51:47] supernatural occurred several times in
[51:49] history without sin scientific
[51:51] understanding I used several examples in
[51:54] the Bible know in the art regardless of
[51:56] scientific proof it rained 40 days and
[51:58] night God shut the door not knowing
[52:00] another example was Joshua and the son
[52:03] standing still and the question was
[52:05] asked how when scientific research says
[52:08] there had to be movement I stated I
[52:11] don't know how God did it I just know it
[52:14] happened he said but before leaving the
[52:16] campus I shared that I would be at J mu
[52:19] which is a college there near by brother
[52:20] on visiting special friends and church
[52:23] family in Elkton I shared the you tink
[52:26] youtube link and expressed you could

[52:36] my phone kept vibrating I knew it must
[52:38] be urgent as my family knew I was in
[52:40] church so I checked my phone it was dr.
[52:43] u he had decided to check out the
[52:46] youtube link and
[52:47] brother Pruitt's comments about Joshua
[52:50] and the son standing steel and he's
[52:52] shared that he was so overwhelmed by
[52:54] presents they came in his room that he
[52:57] fell on his knees and gave his heart to
[52:59] the Lord
[53:08] hallelujah
[53:15] he was thankful that the Lord understood
[53:18] him as he had never prayed he had never
[53:22] prayed he asked me what should I do next
[53:24] I replied be baptized in the name of the
[53:27] Lord Jesus Christ and he quickly said
[53:29] that he knew someone who could do that
[53:31] so thankfully so thanks I'm so thankful
[53:34] to share the good news with others we're
[53:36] looking for the last one I'm thankful
[53:38] that our paths crossed who knew I would
[53:40] complete my graduate studies and would
[53:42] encourage him to listen to the truth God
[53:44] knew and I'm so thankful
[53:56] brother Tim writes this this morning he
[53:58] said as you all know I was supposed to
[54:00] be leaving to minister in Japan but God
[54:03] had other plans and he sent me on a
[54:05] mission and a while here God has saved a
[54:08] Japanese professor this is an incredible
[54:11] miracle I just think it's so amazing I
[54:13] forfeited going to Japan to come here
[54:15] and God still saves a Japanese answering
[54:19] his question discerning his hearts and
[54:22] he's experienced salvation what a mighty
[54:24] God whose vision were walking in like
[54:26] Philip leaving a meeting to minister to
[54:29] one man the ministry continues
[54:40] so what shall we say we're writing
[54:43] another book of Acts hallelujah you know
[54:48] when you speak sometimes feeling the
[54:51] anointing of God the devil loves to come
[54:53] and whisper in your ear and just say
[54:54] well you just made all that up you just
[54:56] kind of got a little feeling got a
[54:58] little excited but when God comes behind
[55:00] it and backs it up with healing and
[55:03] salvation that'll shut the mouth of the
[55:06] enemy hallelujah we are writing another

[58:14] be unto you and peace from him which is
[58:16] which was and which is to come from the
[58:20] seven spirits which are before his
[58:22] throne and from Jesus Christ who is the

[58:56] a man I am Alpha and Omega the beginning
[59:01] and the ending saith the LORD which is
[59:05] which was and which is to come the
[59:07] Almighty and I John who also am your
[59:11] brother and companion companion in
[59:13] tribulation and in kingdom and patience
[59:16] of Jesus Christ which was in the isle
[59:18] that is called Patmos for the word of
[59:20] God and for the testimony of Jesus
[59:22] Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[59:26] Day and behind heard behind me a great
[59:28] voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha
[59:31] and Omega the first and the last and
[59:35] what they'll see us write in the book
[59:37] and send it into the seven churches
[59:38] which are in Asia to Ephesus Smyrna
[59:41] Pergamum Thyatira unto Sardis unto
[59:44] Philadelphia and the Laodicea and I
[59:47] turned and see it and turned to see the
[59:49] voice that spake with me and being
[59:51] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[59:54] and in the midst of the seven
[59:56] candlesticks was one like unto the Son
[59:58] of man clothed in a garment down to the
[1:00:01] foot and Girt around about the paps with
[1:00:04] a golden girdle his head and his hairs
[1:00:06] were like white like wool as white as
[1:00:10] snow and his eyes were as a flame of
[1:00:12] fire and his feet like unto fine brass
[1:00:15] as they were burned in a furnace and his
[1:00:18] voice as the sound of many waters and he
[1:00:21] had in his right hand seven stars and
[1:00:24] out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged
[1:00:28] sword and his countless were as the
[1:00:30] sunshine lethen his strength and when I
[1:00:33] saw him I fell at his feet as dead and
[1:00:36] he laid his right hand upon me saying
[1:00:39] unto me fear not I am the first and the
[1:00:43] last I am he that liveth and was dead
[1:00:46] and behold I am Alive for evermore amen
[1:00:49] and have the keys of hell and of death
[1:00:54] amen let me let you be seated today
[1:01:03] as we look at this picture of the Son of
[1:01:08] Man clothed with a garment down to his
[1:01:11] foot and Girt about the paps with a
[1:01:14] golden girdle his head and his hairs
[1:01:16] were like white wool signifying as a
[1:01:19] judge representing the judges white as
[1:01:22] snow and his eyes were as flames of fire
[1:01:25] and his feet were like unto fine brass
[1:01:29] in other words it was very heavy they
[1:01:32] were very big and bold they were they
[1:01:34] were feet that were ready he meant to
[1:01:37] stand upon anything that would rise up
[1:01:39] against it and as they an age they
[1:01:41] burned in the furnace and his feet and
[1:01:44] his voice as a sound of many waters and
[1:01:47] he had in his right hand seven stars and
[1:01:50] out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged
[1:01:52] sword so as we will read later on and
[1:01:55] just full of the angel that stood there
[1:01:57] and we'd read it here in the last couple
[1:01:58] of services but the angel that stood
[1:02:01] there with a sword that was drawn he was
[1:02:03] showing or signifying that he had come
[1:02:06] down to be a men to place himself in the
[1:02:09] battle to place himself a man with you
[1:02:13] or with Joshua amen as we read here he
[1:02:16] may send a message to all seven Church
[1:02:18] ages so we believe that we are in the
[1:02:20] label to see in the last church age but
[1:02:22] he showed in this first this first
[1:02:25] chapter of Revelations showing very Amen
[1:02:28] significantly significantly and very
[1:02:31] openly that he was in every church age
[1:02:34] that it was not you trying to order
[1:02:37] those to the cert 7 church age he is
[1:02:39] trying to battle long or trying to war
[1:02:41] by themselves but he placed himself
[1:02:43] there with them and he placed himself
[1:02:46] amen in a in a posture of war in a
[1:02:51] posture Amen of supreme dominance and a
[1:02:54] posture of supreme authority amen his
[1:02:57] authority as a judge Authority as a
[1:02:59] warrior amen and but not only did he do
[1:03:02] that he also placed you as kings and
[1:03:05] priests he meant to have a dominion over
[1:03:08] something you know and you know and as
[1:03:10] he would say here I
[1:03:11] he said it through here many times I am
[1:03:13] Alpha and Omega I am the first and the
[1:03:16] last he was showing I'm the one who
[1:03:19] started the work is the one who's going
[1:03:21] to finish the work and nowhere in
[1:03:23] between will I not be present he meant
[1:03:25] so nowhere where you're at no matter
[1:03:27] what you're in your trouble your
[1:03:29] tribulation or your trial just as he
[1:03:31] showed that the the Israelites as they
[1:03:34] would come through the wilderness he
[1:03:36] says he said I'm taking you out and I'm
[1:03:38] taking you in I'm the first I'm the last
[1:03:40] I'm the Alpha I'm the Omega a man he was
[1:03:43] showing he was putting himself in every
[1:03:46] footstep along the journey he was
[1:03:48] putting himself in every situation and
[1:03:51] every day every moment every minute
[1:03:53] listen this God is not a god somewhere
[1:03:55] way off somewhere ain't meant so in the
[1:03:57] far distant land or some other galaxy
[1:04:00] but he's showing you he's ever-present
[1:04:02] help right now in the time of trouble
[1:04:05] and he's saying I am he that was the Fed
[1:04:07] is the first and the last I am he that
[1:04:11] liveth was dead but behold I'm alive
[1:04:14] forevermore
[1:04:15] all right what was he speaking of I am
[1:04:18] the resurrection and the life I am the
[1:04:22] resurrection of the life he come down to
[1:04:24] show he is a conquering man he's come
[1:04:27] down to show that he was not to be
[1:04:29] conquered but he was to conquer now in
[1:04:32] his life as he lives on here on earth
[1:04:34] when we would look at him as he would go
[1:04:36] and he would willingly give himself to
[1:04:38] Pilate he would willingly give himself
[1:04:40] to judgment he would willingly give
[1:04:42] himself to this stripes on his back and
[1:04:45] the thorns upon his head and the nails
[1:04:47] on his feet in his hand it looked like
[1:04:49] he was going down defeated it looked
[1:04:51] like Satan had cut I was going to take
[1:04:53] him down into death just like he took
[1:04:55] any my other man but God has a greater
[1:04:57] plan and as we've heard even this
[1:04:59] morning that even though times in our
[1:05:02] lives it looked like we're going to go
[1:05:03] down and destruction it looks like our
[1:05:05] boats about to go down it looks like
[1:05:08] sickness is about to overtake us God has
[1:05:10] a plan and God has you from your first
[1:05:13] breath to your last breath
[1:05:16] God has you from your first moments of
[1:05:18] time in life and things you go through
[1:05:19] and trials and tribulations at your face
[1:05:22] he has you from the first moment to your
[1:05:25] last moment hey man you know when he was
[1:05:28] on here on earth
[1:05:29] Adams race had many fears you know they
[1:05:32] had fears and things and they still have
[1:05:33] them today and brother Brown said they
[1:05:35] shouldn't have them because Christ won
[1:05:38] it all at Calvary he won the victory at
[1:05:42] Calvary you know when he was here on
[1:05:44] earth he walked up to a sick man and
[1:05:46] sickness had bound the human race and he
[1:05:49] said thou spirit about DevOps II come
[1:05:53] out of the man what was it he came to
[1:05:56] conquer every devil he came down not to
[1:06:00] be defeated he came down to be
[1:06:03] victorious he came down in human flesh
[1:06:06] to take on human battles to know what
[1:06:08] you're going through this morning to
[1:06:09] know the trials of your life to
[1:06:11] understand what it's like for you to go
[1:06:14] through what you go through he wanted to
[1:06:16] be a God of every day he wanted to be a
[1:06:19] God of every moment he wanted to be a
[1:06:21] God who can have compassion upon you and
[1:06:23] know what it's like to have a headache
[1:06:25] know what it's like for your blood
[1:06:27] pressure to be you know what it's like
[1:06:29] when your body's turning against you
[1:06:31] things are happening he wanted to know
[1:06:33] about it so he came down to conquer
[1:06:36] every disease and we see here when he
[1:06:39] was on earth he would speak not to her
[1:06:41] he wouldn't save you blood pressure or
[1:06:43] or use cancer or are you blindness or
[1:06:46] then he would say thou spirit without
[1:06:49] devil he meant what was it he was coming
[1:06:52] down to show us it's not a flesh and
[1:06:54] blood affair but we were fighting
[1:06:56] against principalities against powers up
[1:06:59] against all kind of darkness and high
[1:07:01] places
[1:07:01] amen but he came to show us amen that we
[1:07:05] can beat more than conquerors as he was
[1:07:07] he conquered a devil when he laid at the
[1:07:10] grave of a dead man he conquered death
[1:07:13] for the man or sickness amen are some
[1:07:16] kind of spirit that would overtake a
[1:07:17] maniac and just try to destroy him he
[1:07:20] came down to conquer him he conquered a
[1:07:24] death
[1:07:24] everywhere he met him he conquered the
[1:07:31] devil everywhere he met him and I want
[1:07:35] you to understand he still does that
[1:07:37] today he conquers the devil everywhere
[1:07:42] he meets him if he meets him in a church
[1:07:45] service or he meets him in the prayer
[1:07:46] line or it meets him in a living room
[1:07:49] and then cancer is trying to eat up a
[1:07:51] body that devil has to be conquered and
[1:07:54] put under our feet hallelujah he
[1:07:57] conquered the devil everywhere he met
[1:08:00] him and he not only conquered in himself
[1:08:03] but he left the Commission to you the
[1:08:06] church and said you shall lay hands upon
[1:08:09] the sick and they shall recover
[1:08:13] hallelujah how could he put that in the
[1:08:16] scripture without backing up what he
[1:08:18] said and I know they got scholars and
[1:08:22] social gospel preachers that want to say
[1:08:24] that that's not ain't been anointed
[1:08:26] anymore but it's amazing what God can do
[1:08:28] with a nun anointed Scripture any man if
[1:08:32] that's not an order that's amazing what
[1:08:34] God can do with a nun anointed Scripture
[1:08:36] but I'm here to tell you it is anointed
[1:08:38] it came from the very voice of Almighty
[1:08:41] God and even as he would speak out of a
[1:08:44] flesh by man named Jesus and he would
[1:08:47] say you shall lay hands I love how I
[1:08:50] said it he once again as he would use
[1:08:52] the word all he didn't put a bunch of
[1:08:54] clauses in there and say a preacher or a
[1:08:57] minister or an angel this for that or
[1:09:00] something you gotta have so many px
[1:09:02] there he said you how many use do we
[1:09:05] have in the building hallelujah Amen you
[1:09:10] shall lay hands ask anything in my name
[1:09:13] and I'll do it so see what he said what
[1:09:15] what needs to take place is you need to
[1:09:18] start fighting with what's in your hands
[1:09:22] do you realize when you have given your
[1:09:24] heart to God and you lay hands upon
[1:09:26] there there's actually Amen portions of
[1:09:29] the Holy Ghost anointing of God that
[1:09:32] floats from those
[1:09:33] and begins to move upon a sick person
[1:09:36] listen to those hands that's been filled
[1:09:39] with the Holy Ghost it's no different
[1:09:41] than the hands are stood on a brown the
[1:09:43] boat and said peace be still
[1:09:46] hallelujah it's the same power of God
[1:09:49] because this is word working in his
[1:09:51] people I know people got now so full of
[1:09:55] doubt they don't want to do they don't
[1:09:57] want to believe that all things are
[1:09:58] possible why because they doubting
[1:10:00] themselves but I'm here to tell you that
[1:10:03] it is everything is possible you know I
[1:10:07] got a call yes your other day from a
[1:10:10] young man and he called me and he just
[1:10:12] he just had to move Church because his
[1:10:16] pastors been began to move away from the
[1:10:18] message he said I just had to call you
[1:10:21] said because I I went to Walmart and I
[1:10:24] was that Walmart getting a few things
[1:10:25] and I met this lady that was from my
[1:10:27] former church and he said you know III
[1:10:31] begin to till we were getting to talk
[1:10:32] how you doing this setting the other and
[1:10:34] next thing you know it led one thing led
[1:10:35] to another and she said well we're just
[1:10:37] happy other Tim brothers easiest having
[1:10:39] to get away from preaching the message
[1:10:40] because you know it's not producing
[1:10:43] overcoming life and young people you
[1:10:47] know his brother said yeah I had to stop
[1:10:48] Reese and I'll pay your gas
[1:10:50] he said won't you drive to Louisiana
[1:10:53] they even the light Tabernacle he said
[1:10:55] I'll show you a church where a message
[1:10:58] is produced and overcoming life and
[1:11:00] young people he said if you don't want
[1:11:02] to go there you go to brother Ron
[1:11:04] Spencer's brother John spirits go
[1:11:06] wherever he said I'm telling you this
[1:11:08] message works
[1:11:12] hallelujah he said you know you said the
[1:11:15] reason why I had to leave the same place
[1:11:17] you're at he said because I thought I
[1:11:19] was weak side and then convinced myself
[1:11:20] I was back slid there was no hope for me
[1:11:23] it was nothing I can do about it he said
[1:11:26] but then I begin to realize I was
[1:11:27] hearing the wrong message he said today
[1:11:31] I can see I can be saved my family can
[1:11:35] be saved my daughters can be saved my
[1:11:37] son can be safe because there is a
[1:11:39] message that works hallelujah I know
[1:11:46] we're living in the day whether you
[1:11:48] brother any would call it a social
[1:11:50] gospel make anymore peace and make any
[1:11:53] more livable listen this word of God is
[1:11:57] only livable by the Holy Ghost
[1:12:01] you won't educate yourself into it you
[1:12:04] won't get enough degrees to make
[1:12:06] yourself believe it even you won't you
[1:12:09] know Matt enough message theology sooner
[1:12:11] or later somebody else smarter come
[1:12:13] along and talk to you out of it we're
[1:12:14] not interested in a social gospel I'm
[1:12:20] interested in the same gospel Jesus
[1:12:22] preached hallelujah amen he said what he
[1:12:28] said what happened he said churches are
[1:12:29] denying themselves making it a social
[1:12:31] religion he said it's a terrible day
[1:12:34] they're trying to take all the deity out
[1:12:36] of it all the glory away from Christ
[1:12:39] trying to make him just a prophet if
[1:12:41] Christ was just a prophet where I ever
[1:12:43] won lost Liz Lena's going on in message
[1:12:48] churches right now trying to make Jesus
[1:12:52] just another man a prophet somewhere
[1:12:54] listen if he was just a prophet we're
[1:12:56] all lost
[1:12:57] he died in vain come on now but he was
[1:13:03] more than a prophet
[1:13:05] a woman told him you know brother
[1:13:07] branham there's one thing that I do not
[1:13:08] like about your speaking and said what
[1:13:10] is that
[1:13:10] he said you try to magnify Christ too
[1:13:12] much you brag on him too much you try to
[1:13:14] make him more than what he is
[1:13:16] I said if I had 10,000 languages I could
[1:13:19] exhaust them and never explained what he
[1:13:21] really is he's worthy of every praise
[1:13:25] that I could ever give him and I want
[1:13:28] you to understand this message that we
[1:13:30] preach is not the message of William
[1:13:32] Branham it's the message of Jesus Christ
[1:13:37] hallelujah I don't know where people get
[1:13:39] the idea that we preaches something
[1:13:41] other than Jesus this message is Jesus
[1:13:44] he showed himself all the way down
[1:13:46] through every Church age showing himself
[1:13:48] that he's in our midst hallelujah she
[1:13:57] said well I heard you say the platform
[1:13:59] you know he said if you if you said she
[1:14:02] said if I explained to you improved you
[1:14:04] by the word he was just a man you try to
[1:14:06] make him dear to us that he was deity
[1:14:08] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:14:11] to himself if he is just a prophet we're
[1:14:13] all lost he said I prove to you we
[1:14:16] acceptance is sure with the Bible said
[1:14:18] it I accepted
[1:14:19] she said well when we went down to the
[1:14:21] grave of Lazarus the Bible says he wept
[1:14:24] if he'd have been deity he couldn't we
[1:14:27] so that made him nothing but just an
[1:14:29] ordinary good man I said sister your
[1:14:31] arguments no good at all
[1:14:33] I said you failed to see you solve a man
[1:14:37] but you fail to see the God in the man I
[1:14:40] said it's the truth when he went down
[1:14:42] the grave of Lazarus he wept like a man
[1:14:45] but when he pulled those little
[1:14:46] shoulders back and he pulled himself
[1:14:49] together and he looked at the face of a
[1:14:52] dead man and had been on a journey for
[1:14:54] four days and he said Lazarus come
[1:14:57] forward and a dead man stood to his feet
[1:14:59] again that was more
[1:15:01] than a man speaking that was the mighty
[1:15:03] Conqueror
[1:15:07] what happened God had come down to fight
[1:15:10] Lazarus battle the dead man stood to his
[1:15:16] feet that was God speaking through his
[1:15:19] son he was a man but when it came off
[1:15:21] the mountain that night hungry had
[1:15:23] nothing to he looked around with a fig
[1:15:25] tree to find something he was a man when
[1:15:27] he was a hungry
[1:15:28] but when he took five biscuits and two
[1:15:31] little fish and fed 5,000 that was more
[1:15:34] than a man that was God speaking
[1:15:39] hallelujah listen I've heard man speak
[1:15:42] but I've also heard God speak and God
[1:15:46] speaking said it's going to be this way
[1:15:48] and it happened it's still happening our
[1:15:51] generation in our church truly he was a
[1:15:58] man when he was on the back of that
[1:16:00] little boat Ten Thousand Devils the sea
[1:16:03] swore they'd drown him flopping around
[1:16:05] there like a little bottle on a mighty
[1:16:07] seeing the devil saying now we got him
[1:16:09] but when he woke mm he put his foot on
[1:16:15] the braille of that boat and looked up
[1:16:17] and said peace be still and the waves
[1:16:20] and the winds obeyed him he was more
[1:16:23] than a man he was a man when he called
[1:16:26] for mercy of the cross he died like a
[1:16:28] man but on Easter morning when the seals
[1:16:30] of the Roman government had tried to
[1:16:32] keep him in a tomb and he broke every
[1:16:35] seal and he rose again that he might
[1:16:38] have died like a man but he raised again
[1:16:40] like God he was more than a man he was
[1:16:45] God's mighty Conqueror he said all we
[1:16:48] should love him how he should praise him
[1:16:50] how we should love him as he loved us
[1:16:53] and gave himself for us that we might be
[1:16:56] made more than conquerors listen either
[1:17:00] one of just conquering one man he wanted
[1:17:02] to come conquering many men
[1:17:06] is here he was he never preached the
[1:17:11] funeral what a conquer i'm gonna conquer
[1:17:17] this microphone in just a minute he
[1:17:20] never preached the funeral death
[1:17:22] couldn't stay in his presence how could
[1:17:27] death and life dwell together they can't
[1:17:29] do it that's the reason today when the
[1:17:31] church listen this the church is born
[1:17:35] again of the Spirit of God death and
[1:17:37] life can't hold together no more
[1:17:39] something takes place Christ comes in
[1:17:43] and conquers our passion he conquers our
[1:17:45] desire he conquers all this ungodly his
[1:17:48] vitals because he lives we live also
[1:17:51] I'm the resurrection and the life
[1:17:53] because he lives we live also he
[1:17:56] conquers everything that's ungodly he
[1:17:59] already did it it's laying in our hand
[1:18:01] just to receive it we see him in his
[1:18:03] earthly ministry as a conqueror
[1:18:05] certainly do but let's watch him after
[1:18:08] he died he still went on conquering even
[1:18:13] in death he conquered it didn't it at
[1:18:15] the grave while he was in the grave he
[1:18:17] was still conquer Bible said his soul
[1:18:21] sinning in Hell and he preached the
[1:18:23] spirits that were in prison that
[1:18:25] represents that we've not Reaper did not
[1:18:27] repent in the long suffering days of
[1:18:29] Noah I can see him as heaven and earth
[1:18:31] turning black rocks belching out the
[1:18:34] whole heavens giving up and just crying
[1:18:36] out as he went down descending down to
[1:18:39] the lost souls and those people who
[1:18:41] laughed and made fun of Enoch who made
[1:18:43] fun of Noah I can hear him say I am the
[1:18:46] one that know Enoch said would come with
[1:18:48] ten thousand of it says why didn't you
[1:18:51] believe him why didn't you believe Noah
[1:18:57] he's gonna ask some people same
[1:18:59] questions in this day everything I know
[1:19:02] that had had to know that he conquered
[1:19:05] when he shut the door on them and the
[1:19:07] days of Mercy was over and on down the
[1:19:10] it's pits of hell he went he knocked on
[1:19:12] those doors of the devil's hell
[1:19:14] and the devil came to the door and he
[1:19:16] said well here you are

[1:19:20] killed the prophets I'm sure I had you
[1:19:22] and John head was cut off but after all

[1:19:30] devil's an idiot because they didn't
[1:19:32] know he was in trouble at the moment he
[1:19:34] said I can hear himself he straightened
[1:19:36] himself up and he said Satan I'm the
[1:19:39] Virgin born son of the Living God my
[1:19:42] blood still wet on the cross I paid the
[1:19:44] price I've conquered it and I've come

[1:19:51] I've come down to take over and to strip
[1:19:54] you of everything you claim that you had
[1:19:56] and it reached on his side and he

[1:20:01] off of him and kicked him back in the

[1:26:07] swords drawn in my hand it's not covered
[1:26:10] up it's revealed this is the time of
[1:26:13] Revelation this is a time of revealing
[1:26:15] and the sword that was representing the
[1:26:18] Word of God for their moment and that
[1:26:22] sword was speaking not of their
[1:26:24] destruction but of Jericho's destruction
[1:26:27] he was speaking that they were gonna
[1:26:29] walk out victorious he was saying that a
[1:26:32] menace he would come down and declare
[1:26:34] I'm not on your side but you're on my
[1:26:37] side and I have
[1:26:40] that'll bring the destruction of Jericho
[1:26:43] now Jericho is a perfect type of the
[1:26:46] seals it's typed out in the Bible the
[1:26:49] seven seals were typed out all through
[1:26:50] the Bible Jericho was a stronghold it
[1:26:52] was the key to the rest of the promised
[1:26:54] land and without him coming hoping the
[1:26:58] rest of the land wouldn't be open and no
[1:27:00] doubt others had probed at it they tried
[1:27:02] to conquer Jericho they tried to have
[1:27:04] come against it trying to tear the walls
[1:27:06] down but it was sealed but one day a
[1:27:09] sword came down transferred from the
[1:27:12] angel of the Lord to the hand of Joshua
[1:27:14] hey man a battle plan to bring the walls
[1:27:18] down why was so God so concerned Warner
[1:27:24] would open up the promised land another
[1:27:26] he was concerned about those walls
[1:27:28] because there was a seat of God on the
[1:27:30] inside and he'll do whatever it takes to
[1:27:34] get to that seat he'll cancel trips
[1:27:38] he'll do whatever it takes he'll take a
[1:27:40] man tray translate him all the way over
[1:27:43] to somewhere else to minister to one
[1:27:44] person my goodness if we're not living
[1:27:49] in another book of Acts I don't know
[1:27:51] what's happening
[1:27:52] a sword came down now we know a sword
[1:27:55] came down in our generation brother
[1:27:58] Brandon would speak about he said I was
[1:28:00] standing in prayer this isn't the first
[1:28:01] time I mentioned the breach between the
[1:28:03] seven church ages and seven seals
[1:28:05] mentions a couple of times afterwards so
[1:28:07] standing in prayer something happened
[1:28:09] something fell into my hand he said if
[1:28:11] you don't understand spiritual things as
[1:28:13] may seem very strange but something
[1:28:15] struck my hand and when I looked it was
[1:28:17] a sword and the handle was made of pearl
[1:28:20] the prettiest pearl ever seen the guard
[1:28:22] was gold the sabres blade wasn't too
[1:28:25] long but it was just razor sharp just
[1:28:32] right for cutting Devils heads off
[1:28:35] just right for going in there and
[1:28:37] cutting darkness off of people's hearts
[1:28:41] this sword was so sharp in Joshua's day
[1:28:45] that it would knock the walls of Jericho
[1:28:47] down beset one house the word is the
[1:28:53] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:28:55] the heart
[1:28:55] you think the word didn't know where she
[1:28:57] was at come on now the word knew exactly
[1:29:01] where she was at knew exactly what house
[1:29:04] she was in what a dresser was where she
[1:29:07] was what she was doing and told her you
[1:29:09] get in that house and you stay in that
[1:29:11] house because these walls are going to
[1:29:13] fit God is going to bring us in here and
[1:29:15] if you ain't in that house with that
[1:29:16] scarlet cloak cord down Amen you're
[1:29:19] gonna die but if you do is we have
[1:29:21] commanded you you live that sword was so
[1:29:26] sharp he would go in between the brick
[1:29:28] and the mortar and cut it apart
[1:29:30] amen to leave one outstanding he's still
[1:29:34] a discern of the hearts he still knows
[1:29:36] how to go into where you're at you
[1:29:39] remember when that sword come here to
[1:29:41] where you was that and begin to cut off
[1:29:42] the chains of darkness and the spirits
[1:29:45] around you and the things that said you
[1:29:47] would never be anything and you would
[1:29:48] never make it and it was impossible just
[1:29:50] quit trying but a sword came in and it
[1:29:54] beginning to cut it all off
[1:29:55] Amen what was that it was a sword of God
[1:29:58] that's been delivered in this hour it
[1:30:04] was a sword that would cut the seals off
[1:30:06] a book razor sharp glistening Silver's a
[1:30:11] prettiest thing ever seen and it fit my
[1:30:14] hand exactly and I was holding it and I
[1:30:17] said isn't that pretty but you know he
[1:30:20] said I was afraid of a sword and I was
[1:30:21] kind of I was real glad I didn't live in
[1:30:23] the days when they used them I'm same
[1:30:26] way and I thought what would I do with
[1:30:28] that and while I was holding it a voice
[1:30:31] spoke and said this is the King's sword
[1:30:35] and then he left me and I wonder what it
[1:30:39] meant that is the Kings sword and I
[1:30:42] thought if it was a
[1:30:44] taking sword it might have been that I
[1:30:46] would understood it but it said the
[1:30:48] Kings sword and I thought the only one
[1:30:52] there's only one the king and that's God
[1:30:56] and his sword is this sharper than a
[1:31:00] two-edged sword his word as we read
[1:31:03] revelations 160 he said in his right
[1:31:06] hand seven stars and I was mouth went a
[1:31:09] sharp two-edged sword and his
[1:31:12] countenance was as a sunshine Athena's
[1:31:14] in his strength
[1:31:15] amen in Hebrews 4:12 said the word of
[1:31:18] God is quick and powerful and sharper
[1:31:20] than any two-edged sword and I want you
[1:31:24] to understand this morning we don't have
[1:31:25] just a sword we have the Kings sword we
[1:31:29] don't have just a king sword I was over
[1:31:33] there in France I saw their swords and
[1:31:34] the things you were so proud of held by
[1:31:36] kings of their day and people that held
[1:31:39] dominion and reign for just a moment but
[1:31:41] we have not been given a sword of some
[1:31:43] King gone dead long ago of some
[1:31:45] perversion of some perverted Kingdom we
[1:31:48] have been given a sword in this day it
[1:31:50] is a sword of Almighty God it is a sword
[1:31:54] of the king and that sword has been
[1:31:56] brought down not for our destruction but
[1:32:00] that the walls that had bound you and
[1:32:02] the walls of things that hold you might
[1:32:05] crumble around you hallelujah he said as
[1:32:12] a sharp two-edged sword piercing even
[1:32:14] dividing asunder the soul and spirit of
[1:32:17] the joints in marble you know what it
[1:32:19] feels like for that sword to come on you
[1:32:21] reach right in there and discern your
[1:32:23] heart oh I know out of his mouth went a
[1:32:27] sharp two-edged so now Jay and Joshua
[1:32:30] was they they was fighting a physical
[1:32:31] enemy so he'd come down in the hand of a
[1:32:35] man but now he's saying it's in his
[1:32:38] mouth because we don't fight a physical
[1:32:42] winner it'd be really easy sometimes if
[1:32:44] you could see a devil and grab a sword
[1:32:45] and go cut his head off
[1:32:47] go fight but with us sometimes it just
[1:32:53] sees eeky eeky those things that comes
[1:32:55] around
[1:32:56] and thoughts become to come to our mind
[1:32:59] fear begins to take over us and we begin
[1:33:02] to wilt and we don't even recognize
[1:33:05] before too long it's a devil it's a
[1:33:10] spirit that's attacking you
[1:33:11] you've been under attack you've been
[1:33:16] going through things night after night
[1:33:17] after night spirits haunting here but
[1:33:20] there's a sordid and it's not just a
[1:33:24] sword it's the king sword
[1:33:27] we're not talking about just any man's
[1:33:30] word we're not preaching any man's word
[1:33:33] this was this was signifying a word that
[1:33:36] was coming down to open up the seals to
[1:33:39] open up the book so we can understand
[1:33:40] what God was doing through seven Church
[1:33:43] ages we can understand his love and
[1:33:45] mercy his grace how he was orchestrating
[1:33:47] how he's going to be how and brother
[1:33:49] Brendan sent when those things open to
[1:33:50] him he said the Bible became a new book
[1:33:53] it opened the rest of the promised land
[1:33:56] hallelujah and this is what he's saying
[1:33:58] here and but in Revelations nineteen
[1:34:01] eleven and said I saw heaven opened and
[1:34:02] behold a white horse and he that sat
[1:34:04] upon him was called faithful and true
[1:34:06] and in righteousness he doth judge and
[1:34:10] make war oh yeah here you go again
[1:34:13] he is a lord a man of war and his eyes
[1:34:16] were flame of fire and on his head were
[1:34:18] many crowns and he had a name written
[1:34:21] that no man knew but he himself and he
[1:34:23] was clothed with a vesture dipped in
[1:34:25] blood and his name is called the Word of
[1:34:29] God and the armies which are in heaven
[1:34:31] followed him upon a white horse clothes
[1:34:34] and fine linen white and clean and out
[1:34:36] of his mouth goes a sharp sword that
[1:34:40] with it he would smite the nation's he
[1:34:43] would rule them with a rod of hide he
[1:34:45] would tread upon the winepress of the
[1:34:47] fierceness and the wrath of Almighty God
[1:34:48] and he hath on his vesture and on his
[1:34:51] thigh a name written king
[1:34:54] of kings and Lord of lords and he still
[1:34:58] King of Kings he's still Lord of lords
[1:35:01] we met what you need to do is look at
[1:35:04] when you see your problem before you say
[1:35:06] he's still King he's still Lord you're
[1:35:09] still conquered devil you're still
[1:35:12] conquered it ain't changed this because
[1:35:14] he's not here as far as visibly and
[1:35:16] sometimes we can't see him sometimes we
[1:35:18] can't see it
[1:35:18] that'll mean he ain't working that'll
[1:35:20] mean he ain't moving that ain't
[1:35:22] immediately orchestrating things on your
[1:35:24] behalf and behind the scene pushing
[1:35:26] buttons pulling cords doing whatever
[1:35:28] he's got to do to make sure you make it
[1:35:31] [Applause]
[1:35:34] mercy when it comes that word will come
[1:35:39] against all nations all men and none
[1:35:43] will be able to stand against it they
[1:35:46] may make God these social gospel lights
[1:35:49] and Goliath intellectual Giants might be
[1:35:52] making a bunch of noise and raising
[1:35:54] their voices and screaming that ain't so
[1:35:57] god don't do do anything like that
[1:35:59] anymore you know and there's no more
[1:36:00] prayer lines there's no more altar calls
[1:36:03] there's no more this this is where
[1:36:07] things are trying to go but this is
[1:36:12] where he's at
[1:36:13] he said it will reveal what was in every
[1:36:17] heart as he did Nathanael the Word of
[1:36:20] God will show who did the will of God
[1:36:22] and who didn't
[1:36:22] it'll make known the secret works of
[1:36:24] every man and why he did them it would
[1:36:26] divide asunder that's why it says in
[1:36:28] Romans 2 3 Oh think it's now this old
[1:36:30] man that judges them which does such
[1:36:32] thing and does not the same that thou
[1:36:33] shalt escape the judgment of God then it
[1:36:36] goes on to say how God is going to judge
[1:36:37] men it's hard infinite heart will be
[1:36:40] judged the works will be judged the
[1:36:43] motives of Judge there won't be any
[1:36:44] respect before God but all will be
[1:36:46] judged by the word no one is keeping it
[1:36:48] those who heard and what listen will be
[1:36:50] judged by what they heard those who
[1:36:52] rested in saying they believed it but
[1:36:54] didn't live it will be judged every
[1:36:56] secret will come out and they're hoping
[1:36:57] to be shout it from the housetops oh we
[1:36:59] really will we will
[1:37:01] really understand history then there
[1:37:03] won't be a mystery left from all the
[1:37:05] ages he said but how you know how do you
[1:37:08] know he's revealing the hearts secrets
[1:37:10] of men and women in the age in which
[1:37:12] were living
[1:37:13] who else could reveal the secrets of the
[1:37:15] heart but the word himself this is what
[1:37:21] blows my mind wouldn't you Pierre you
[1:37:22] hear the things that went on in our
[1:37:24] generation and people don't know who
[1:37:25] that was it was God speaking through a
[1:37:28] man only God can know your address no
[1:37:33] exactly the day you moved know exactly
[1:37:37] what's going on you can read it time
[1:37:39] after time never miss why the Word of
[1:37:46] God is quick and powerful and sharper
[1:37:47] than two it is so what it is the word it
[1:37:51] was performing it was performing where
[1:37:53] unto it was sent for the word for it the
[1:37:56] word is full of power full of power it's
[1:38:01] the same spirit that was in Jesus that's
[1:38:03] present again in the church in this last
[1:38:05] days as the last sign trying to head the
[1:38:08] people off from judgment for they that
[1:38:10] rebec reject him the word are now ready
[1:38:12] to come into judgment crucifying himself
[1:38:15] a fretful crucify him fresh again he
[1:38:17] said but now Paul said that the word
[1:38:20] came in power as well as voice the word
[1:38:23] priests actually demonstrates itself
[1:38:27] how many as witness that the word
[1:38:30] preached demonstrates herself
[1:38:33] demonstrations healing salvation cutting
[1:38:36] us loose from complexes spirits of
[1:38:38] torment what is it the word going forth
[1:38:41] demonstrating like a flaming cutting
[1:38:45] sword it goes to the conscious of
[1:38:47] meaning like a surgeon's knife to cut
[1:38:49] out diseases and set captives free
[1:38:51] everywhere those early believers when
[1:38:53] they went preaching the gospel God
[1:38:55] confirming the word with signs following
[1:38:57] it the sick were healed the devils were
[1:38:59] cast out they spoke in new tongues that
[1:39:02] was the word in
[1:39:04] and if you have any other gospel you
[1:39:07] don't have the word in action the word
[1:39:12] listen this the word has never failed in
[1:39:17] the mouth of believing Christians and in
[1:39:24] this last age it's here stronger and
[1:39:27] greater than ever I don't a pump some
[1:39:34] courage in our hearts this man to face
[1:39:37] our adversaries this word is greater
[1:39:41] than stronger and ever in the true word
[1:39:46] Bride
[1:39:48] so what does happen this word has been
[1:39:50] transferred from an angel to a prophet
[1:39:53] to a people hey man
[1:39:57] in Joshua it was transferred to Joshua
[1:40:00] but at some point it was to be
[1:40:01] transferred to the people we can read
[1:40:04] about in Joshua 6 and verse 1 he says
[1:40:09] now Jericho was straightly shut up
[1:40:11] because the children of Israel none went
[1:40:13] out and none come in and the Lord said
[1:40:16] unto John you reckon you reckon Satan
[1:40:19] was scared oh yeah and the Lord said
[1:40:23] unto Joshua see I have given unto thee
[1:40:26] not unto thine hand Jericho and the king
[1:40:30] thereof and the mighty men of valor so
[1:40:33] I've given you everything no matter
[1:40:38] where your feet trod
[1:40:40] that's your possession I have given you
[1:40:42] everything this is a promise that came
[1:40:46] from Abraham down through Israel to
[1:40:48] George Jacob Israel all the way down to
[1:40:50] Moses and then to Joshua as I was with
[1:40:53] Moses so shall be with you and he's
[1:40:55] telling him I'm gonna give you this land
[1:40:58] I'm gonna give it to you I'm gonna give
[1:41:01] you what's in it
[1:41:02] to give you all of it and ye shall
[1:41:04] compassed the city
[1:41:06] all you men of war and go about the city
[1:41:08] once the south I'll do six days and
[1:41:11] seven priests shall bear before their
[1:41:13] heart now notice seven trumpets of rams
[1:41:16] horn now notice how quick closely these
[1:41:18] things are tied together and seventh day
[1:41:20] you shall come pass the city seven times
[1:41:23] and the priests shall blow with the
[1:41:25] trumpets and it shall come to pass and
[1:41:28] when they make a long blast from the
[1:41:30] ram's horns this is the word this is a
[1:41:32] sword that's being transferred to Joshua
[1:41:34] a man and what you follow and when they
[1:41:38] made a long blast with the ram's horn
[1:41:40] when they hear the sound of the trumpet
[1:41:41] all the people shall shout with a great
[1:41:45] shout so sooner or later it's going to
[1:41:48] go from the angel to Joshua to the
[1:41:51] people amen and the wall of the city
[1:41:56] shall fall down flat and the people
[1:41:59] shall sing upon every man straight
[1:42:01] before him and Joshua the son of nun
[1:42:03] called the priest and said take up the
[1:42:05] Ark of the Covenant let seven priests
[1:42:07] bear seven trumpets of rams horns before
[1:42:10] the Ark of the Lord and he said unto the
[1:42:12] people pass on and compassed the city
[1:42:15] and let him that his arm pass before the
[1:42:17] Ark of the Lord and it came to pass that
[1:42:19] Joshua had spoken unto the people that
[1:42:22] the seven priests band the seven
[1:42:23] trumpets of rams horn passed before the
[1:42:26] Lord and blew the trumpets in the Ark of
[1:42:28] the Lord Oh coming to the Lord followed
[1:42:30] them and the armed men with and all the
[1:42:32] ones rearward from the art the priests
[1:42:34] going don't blow it with trumpets and
[1:42:35] Joshua had commanded the people saying
[1:42:38] ye shall not shout nor make any noise
[1:42:41] why your voice neither shall any word
[1:42:43] proceed out of your mouth until the day
[1:42:46] I bid you shout then ye shout shout Oh
[1:42:52] hallelujah on that day you will speak to
[1:42:55] your mountain and your mountain will
[1:42:59] obey your voice
[1:43:01] Oh hallelujah amen what was the seven
[1:43:05] times around and on the seventh day
[1:43:07] seven times around and at that last
[1:43:09] moment shout in that seventh age or that
[1:43:14] seventh time there was a transfer that
[1:43:17] took place from a prophet to a people
[1:43:19] that we have a voice and it's not our
[1:43:24] voice but it's the voice of the
[1:43:26] resurrection speaking inside of us we
[1:43:31] have a force and I call them from the
[1:43:33] grave we have a voice and I call our
[1:43:35] children back we have a voice and I
[1:43:39] speak and the bear give life we have a
[1:43:42] voice that'll speak to cancer and it'll
[1:43:45] have to COO we have a voice and I don't
[1:43:48] say there'd be so much money and it was
[1:43:49] we have a voice that says build a church
[1:43:52] and we did and let me tell you he's
[1:44:00] still the god of miracles he's been
[1:44:03] through us with us through every step of
[1:44:05] the journey look around he's been with
[1:44:08] us and even this week were meeting with
[1:44:13] a group that's taken over the over the
[1:44:16] graveyard and they're buying our old
[1:44:19] church since buildings from us giving us
[1:44:24] money enough that we'll better finish
[1:44:34] that building over there dead free
[1:44:37] [Applause]
[1:44:48] do we have a voice in her in her church
[1:44:52] ain't the voice of man is the voice of
[1:44:54] Resurrection hallelujah
[1:44:58] in Joshua on the seventh day Joshua rose
[1:45:01] early in the morning the priest took her
[1:45:03] put the Ark of the Lord and seven
[1:45:05] priests bearing seven trumpets of rams
[1:45:06] horns or the Ark of the Lord went on
[1:45:08] continued and blew the trumpet the armed
[1:45:10] men went before them but rearward came
[1:45:13] the Ark of the Lord and priests going on
[1:45:14] blowing the ark second day all the way
[1:45:16] down seventh day they rose early the
[1:45:18] dawning of the day it is the rising of
[1:45:20] the Sun the dawning of the day and
[1:45:23] compassed the City after the same manner
[1:45:24] seven times and on that day that can
[1:45:27] pass the city seven times and it came to
