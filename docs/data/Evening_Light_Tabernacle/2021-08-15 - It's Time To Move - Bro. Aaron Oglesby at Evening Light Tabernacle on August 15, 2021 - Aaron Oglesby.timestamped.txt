[1:06:08] like to thank the the church body here
[1:06:11] for the outpouring of love and support

[1:06:16] experienced in the last couple of weeks

[1:06:25] we say thank you from the bottom of our
[1:06:27] hearts
[1:06:29] it's wonderful to be associated with
[1:06:31] god's people
[1:06:32] amen
[1:06:34] exodus 14
[1:06:36] verse 15.
[1:06:38] it says i'm going to read one verse here
[1:06:40] and it says and the lord said unto moses
[1:06:44] wherefore christ thou unto me
[1:06:46] speak unto the children of israel
[1:06:49] that they go forward emphasizing there
[1:06:52] that they
[1:06:54] go forward
[1:06:55] deuteronomy the first chapter
[1:06:57] and the fifth verse
[1:07:01] it says on this side jordan in the land
[1:07:03] of moab began moses to declare this law
[1:07:07] saying
[1:07:08] the lord our god spake unto us in horeb
[1:07:10] saying ye have dwelt long enough in this
[1:07:14] mount
[1:07:16] turn you
[1:07:17] right there turn you
[1:07:19] there's a turn made there's a corner
[1:07:21] turn in other words quit doing
[1:07:24] what you've been doing
[1:07:26] it's time to do something different
[1:07:28] you've been where you're at long enough
[1:07:30] it's time to turn
[1:07:31] turn ye and take your journey and go to
[1:07:34] the mount of the amorites and to all the
[1:07:36] places neither unto
[1:07:38] in the plain in the hills and in the
[1:07:40] veil and in the south and by the seaside
[1:07:42] to the land of the canaanites and unto
[1:07:45] lebanon unto the great river the river
[1:07:47] euphrates behold i have set the land
[1:07:50] before you
[1:07:52] go in and possess the land which the
[1:07:54] lord swear unto your fathers abraham
[1:07:58] isaac and jacob to give unto them and to
[1:08:00] their seed after them amen
[1:08:04] may god add his blessings to the reading
[1:08:06] of the word as you have your seats
[1:08:12] so many scriptures as i looked through
[1:08:14] this
[1:08:16] this week so many scriptures that i
[1:08:17] could have used or could have read
[1:08:20] but these two here succinctly really
[1:08:22] summed up the theme for what i want to
[1:08:24] speak on
[1:08:26] today
[1:08:27] and if i give this a title today it
[1:08:29] would be it's time to move
[1:08:32] it's time
[1:08:34] to move
[1:08:35] there in the first scripture in exodus
[1:08:37] 14 and 15 it says the lord said unto
[1:08:39] moses wherefore christ unto me speak
[1:08:42] unto the children of israel that
[1:08:44] they
[1:08:45] go
[1:08:46] forward notice in this he doesn't he
[1:08:48] didn't say i realize it's going to be
[1:08:50] difficult i realize there's something in
[1:08:51] front of them i see this i see that i
[1:08:53] see these circumstances he just said
[1:08:56] they need to go forward they need to
[1:08:59] move on and then the next scripture the
[1:09:01] lord spake unto you and says you have
[1:09:04] gone round this mountain long enough
[1:09:06] it's time for you to move now i don't
[1:09:09] really know where you're at this morning
[1:09:12] i don't know each and every one of you's
[1:09:13] personal experience with the lord we're
[1:09:15] all at different stages along the
[1:09:17] journey obviously but wherever you are
[1:09:19] today
[1:09:20] you can't stay there wherever you are
[1:09:22] whether you're the most saintly of
[1:09:24] saints among us whether you're a
[1:09:25] borderline believer a backslider or
[1:09:27] shall i say even a sinner that has never
[1:09:29] accepted the lord jesus you cannot stay
[1:09:32] where you're at today you must go
[1:09:34] forward you must move the word of the
[1:09:36] lord is calling out to you today saying
[1:09:39] go forward leave where you're at take a
[1:09:41] turn do something different and walk
[1:09:43] forward in the lord today
[1:09:46] the entire
[1:09:47] history or story that we of the bible
[1:09:50] deals with god moving
[1:09:52] and god calling
[1:09:54] us people to move and also it deals with
[1:09:57] the response of the people that he is
[1:09:59] dealing with
[1:10:00] and in this we find that god is always
[1:10:02] trying to get his people to move
[1:10:05] according to his leading you know many
[1:10:07] times people move but they're moving on
[1:10:09] their own accord many times people are
[1:10:11] moving and they're going here and
[1:10:12] they're doing that it's because what
[1:10:14] they think and according to their
[1:10:15] understanding and i think i should do
[1:10:17] this and i think i should do that but i
[1:10:19] believe in this day with the pillar of
[1:10:21] fire return to the back in the church
[1:10:23] again that we should be a people that
[1:10:24] are led by the pillar of fire a people
[1:10:27] that are led by the holy spirit
[1:10:30] and in this interaction with god and his
[1:10:33] people he's always trying to get them to
[1:10:34] move according to his leading and he's
[1:10:37] always calling them out of something or
[1:10:40] else he's calling them into something
[1:10:42] and these two things go hand in hand and
[1:10:44] these things go together because he's
[1:10:47] always trying to get you to come to
[1:10:49] something better god's always trying to
[1:10:51] get you to come to something better so
[1:10:53] many times we're holding on oh but god
[1:10:55] this is good god this is a blessing i
[1:10:57] don't want to let it go and if you could
[1:10:59] just see what he's trying to call you to
[1:11:02] if you could just see where he's trying
[1:11:04] to trying to call you to you would
[1:11:05] recognize he's always trying to call you
[1:11:08] and lead you into something more and
[1:11:10] into something better he calls us out of
[1:11:14] bondage and he brings us to deliverance
[1:11:16] he calls us out of sickness and he
[1:11:17] brings us into health he calls you out
[1:11:19] of a lost condition and he brings you
[1:11:21] into salvation he'll lead you from
[1:11:23] justification to sanctification to the
[1:11:26] baptism of the holy ghost he's always
[1:11:28] trying to lead you into something more
[1:11:30] something deeper something greater in
[1:11:33] his spirit
[1:11:34] when we walk with god we find that he
[1:11:37] doesn't take you to a lesser place it's
[1:11:40] always to a greater place because our
[1:11:42] god is a rewarder our god is a rewarder
[1:11:45] of those who serve him our god is a
[1:11:47] rewarder of those who diligently seek
[1:11:49] him our god is a rewarder he will be
[1:11:51] indebted to no man and he's always
[1:11:54] rewarding you he's always leading you to
[1:11:56] something greater first samuel two and
[1:11:59] eight says he raiseth up the poor out of
[1:12:01] the dust and lifted up the beggar from
[1:12:03] the dunghill to set them among princes
[1:12:06] and to make them inherit
[1:12:08] the throne of glory
[1:12:10] he wants you to move from whatever
[1:12:13] condition you're in today
[1:12:15] to the next
[1:12:16] because by nature our god is a great
[1:12:19] shepherd
[1:12:20] and the shepherd wants to lead
[1:12:22] and a shepherd wants to protect
[1:12:24] and many times it's us that get
[1:12:26] ourselves in trouble the reason he had
[1:12:28] to leave the 99 and go find the one is
[1:12:31] because the one thought he knew a better
[1:12:32] way
[1:12:33] the one thought he could find his way
[1:12:35] better the one hard-headed one how many
[1:12:37] of us have been that one before thought
[1:12:39] we could go and do what we want to do
[1:12:40] and i've got plans and i've got ideas
[1:12:42] and i need to do this and he had to come
[1:12:44] bail you out because he is the great
[1:12:47] shepherd and he needs a people we must
[1:12:50] be a people that are willing to follow
[1:12:53] his leadership
[1:12:54] god leads we follow that's how this
[1:12:57] thing works out you want to know how to
[1:12:59] make it a lot easier god leads you
[1:13:01] follow
[1:13:02] wherever he tries to get you to go just
[1:13:04] go look if you're his child he's going
[1:13:06] to get you there in the end he may have
[1:13:08] to take you through all kind of stuff he
[1:13:09] may have to save you many times because
[1:13:11] you thought you knew better the easy way
[1:13:13] is god leads i'm going to follow lord
[1:13:16] wherever you lead me today i'm going to
[1:13:19] follow you
[1:13:21] we speak and we believe and we say that
[1:13:24] we are a people of faith
[1:13:28] but faith
[1:13:29] doesn't always just mean believing for
[1:13:31] miracles
[1:13:33] sure we need that
[1:13:35] and we do
[1:13:36] but faith isn't always just believing
[1:13:38] for miracles faith is believing that if
[1:13:40] he said let's get in the boat and cross
[1:13:42] over to the other side
[1:13:44] that we're going to cross over to the
[1:13:45] other side no matter what comes no
[1:13:47] matter what happens that's what faith is
[1:13:49] that's why they're in mark 4 when the
[1:13:51] disciples begin to question and they
[1:13:52] begin to worry and they begin to doubt
[1:13:54] he comes up and he asks them he says why
[1:13:56] don't you have any
[1:13:57] faith
[1:13:59] why don't you have any faith we're a
[1:14:01] people of faith we can trust it listen
[1:14:03] this is an eternal god with an eternal
[1:14:05] word and if he said it he said it then
[1:14:07] it's going to happen listen there is no
[1:14:09] devil in hell that can stop an eternal
[1:14:11] word of god there is no devil in hell
[1:14:13] that can stop a seed gene of god if he
[1:14:15] said you're going to make it you're
[1:14:17] going to make it if he said i'll have a
[1:14:18] bride without spot or wrinkle it might
[1:14:20] as well be me if god said by my stripes
[1:14:23] you're healed then by you his stripes
[1:14:25] you are healed there is no devil in hell
[1:14:28] that can stop an eternal word of god and
[1:14:31] god said get in the boat we're going
[1:14:33] over and i say let's get in the boat
[1:14:35] this morning and let's trust no matter
[1:14:36] what ways come no matter what storms
[1:14:39] come we're going over because nothing
[1:14:41] can stop the eternal word of god
[1:14:45] you can have faith in this god today
[1:14:47] you can have faith for your situation
[1:14:50] because this god has never failed i
[1:14:52] failed many times you have failed many
[1:14:54] times man has failed all through the
[1:14:56] ages but this god has never failed and
[1:14:59] you can put your faith in him today
[1:15:04] and he's calling us today
[1:15:06] to move
[1:15:09] many times we become comfortable where
[1:15:10] we are
[1:15:12] because we're so much different than the
[1:15:15] world
[1:15:16] there's such a difference there we're
[1:15:18] separated from the world we feel like
[1:15:19] we've done what we need to do
[1:15:22] but you have to understand the world is
[1:15:23] not your standard
[1:15:25] the world don't look at the world and go
[1:15:27] look how good i am listen they are no
[1:15:29] standard to measure yourself against
[1:15:32] the only time you should worry about
[1:15:33] what the world looks like if there's
[1:15:34] somehow some way you start looking like
[1:15:36] them then you got problems
[1:15:38] but don't judge your christianity based
[1:15:41] off how much you have separated from the
[1:15:43] world sometimes we feel like look how
[1:15:45] far i've come so i'm good enough i'm
[1:15:47] comfortable and we set down right there
[1:15:50] and we begin to occupy a position
[1:15:52] we began to go on the defensive and i
[1:15:54] have this and i'm setting up my
[1:15:56] fortification and woo the devil ain't
[1:15:58] gonna take this from me that's good but
[1:16:01] you've turned your back on where you're
[1:16:02] supposed to be going you got here and
[1:16:04] you set up a fortification and said i'm
[1:16:06] not giving this up that's fine don't
[1:16:08] give that up but move on take another
[1:16:10] step go further go deeper go to more
[1:16:13] he's expecting you to come further with
[1:16:16] him this morning because he has so much
[1:16:19] more to give you he has so much more to
[1:16:21] offer you
[1:16:22] don't settle down where you are this
[1:16:24] morning
[1:16:27] we sat down right there and we began to
[1:16:29] occupy a position
[1:16:31] but this morning i want to say god is
[1:16:33] calling
[1:16:35] god is calling some of you this morning
[1:16:37] to repentance
[1:16:40] god is calling some of you this morning
[1:16:42] to walk with him like never before
[1:16:45] he's calling some of you this morning to
[1:16:46] step out in faith and trust him for a
[1:16:49] situation
[1:16:51] he's saying you've been in that mountain
[1:16:53] too long
[1:16:54] you've been in that situation too long
[1:16:57] i've been pushing and i've been prodding
[1:16:59] and i've been trying to make it this way
[1:17:01] so you would see and i've been trying to
[1:17:03] call you out so you would see i've been
[1:17:05] trying to make you miserable so you
[1:17:06] would see and this morning he's just
[1:17:07] saying it's time to move
[1:17:09] it's time for you to look at this
[1:17:11] situation and realize i've been here too
[1:17:13] long i've put up with this long enough
[1:17:15] this morning i'm taking the step i need
[1:17:17] to take and i'm walking out in faith i'm
[1:17:20] doing what you're calling me to do i
[1:17:21] know you put it in my heart lord and i
[1:17:23] just haven't been able to do that but
[1:17:24] today i'm pushing aside fear i'm pushing
[1:17:27] aside anxiety i'm pushing inside doubt
[1:17:30] i'm pushing aside worry and i'm going to
[1:17:32] step out to what you're calling me to do
[1:17:34] i'm stepping out into this situation and
[1:17:36] i'm going to trust you this morning
[1:17:38] he's calling you to make a move
[1:17:43] and when god calls you to move
[1:17:46] it's time to move
[1:17:49] genesis 12 1
[1:17:51] now the lord god said unto abram get
[1:17:53] thee out of that country
[1:17:55] and from thy kindred and from thy
[1:17:57] father's house and to a land that i will
[1:17:59] show thee
[1:18:00] and i will make of thee a great nation
[1:18:02] and i will bless thee and make thy name
[1:18:04] great and thou shalt be a blessing
[1:18:07] and i will bless them that bless thee
[1:18:08] and curse him that curseth thee
[1:18:10] and in thee shall all families of the
[1:18:12] earth be blessed
[1:18:14] so
[1:18:15] abram
[1:18:18] stayed there
[1:18:21] thank you lord for this promise
[1:18:23] i know you're going to fulfill it but
[1:18:25] i don't know what's out there
[1:18:28] i don't know how you're going to provide
[1:18:29] for me
[1:18:31] what about my family
[1:18:33] we make a good living here
[1:18:37] i like this church this is the church
[1:18:38] i've been in my whole life
[1:18:42] this is all i know i'm comfortable
[1:18:46] the first verse said get thee out
[1:18:50] and so abram departed
[1:18:53] as the lord had spoken unto him
[1:18:56] abram depart i want you to notice here
[1:18:59] there was a part
[1:19:00] he had to play
[1:19:03] look there was a promise given but it
[1:19:05] came with a part for you to play
[1:19:07] he had to be willing to move
[1:19:10] and i want you to notice it's not always
[1:19:12] in the instant that you move and not
[1:19:14] always in the instant that you obey that
[1:19:17] all of a sudden this thing that you need
[1:19:18] or this blessing you're expecting or
[1:19:20] whatever it is god has for you is just
[1:19:21] poured out upon you
[1:19:24] all right but no place you've never went
[1:19:26] anywhere that it didn't start with a
[1:19:27] step
[1:19:29] you got up this morning out of bed and
[1:19:30] you took a step and you wasn't in the
[1:19:32] church house
[1:19:34] but it was the first step to getting
[1:19:35] here
[1:19:37] it was the first step to being where you
[1:19:38] are
[1:19:39] and when he caused you to move many
[1:19:41] times we get impatient because we take
[1:19:42] that step and then another step and the
[1:19:44] blessings aren't just overflowing all
[1:19:46] over so we're like god why
[1:19:48] what no god said move
[1:19:50] so now you just trust him put your faith
[1:19:52] in him he said get in the boat we're
[1:19:53] going to the other side he said move
[1:19:55] just move just keep walking keep being
[1:19:57] led by the pillar of fire keep being led
[1:19:59] by the holy ghost and when the time
[1:20:01] comes when the appointed time arrives
[1:20:04] he's going to pour out the blessing on
[1:20:06] you that he's promised for you he told
[1:20:07] abram all this stuff all these blessings
[1:20:10] that he was going to all these promises
[1:20:11] that he said move and abram had to move
[1:20:13] for a really long time before it came to
[1:20:16] pass but it came to pass he said we're
[1:20:19] going over so we're going over he said
[1:20:22] you can have your children so you could
[1:20:23] have your children he said you could
[1:20:25] that the mothers wouldn't be bearing so
[1:20:27] you won't be buried he gave promises
[1:20:29] just keep holding on and at the time
[1:20:31] appointed those things will come to pass
[1:20:34] just keep moving just keep walking but
[1:20:36] you got to move this morning
[1:20:42] relationship with god
[1:20:44] is progressing with god
[1:20:47] you do not have a relationship or shall
[1:20:51] i say a healthy relationship
[1:20:54] if you're not progressing
[1:20:57] genesis 5 22
[1:20:59] and enoch walked with god after he beget
[1:21:01] methuselah 300 years and begets sons and
[1:21:04] daughters
[1:21:05] and all the days of enoch were 365 years
[1:21:10] and in it
[1:21:11] walked with god and he was not for god
[1:21:15] took him in other words notice there was
[1:21:17] movement
[1:21:19] brother brown said let's take another
[1:21:20] man with this quickening power there was
[1:21:22] a man way long ago by the name of enoch
[1:21:25] when a new thing come along when
[1:21:27] something come along and said well now
[1:21:28] we have to go back
[1:21:30] to the old school or this or that the
[1:21:32] other enoch walked with god
[1:21:35] whatever god said do enoch never missed
[1:21:38] one word he walked with god what was he
[1:21:41] he was a son
[1:21:43] of god
[1:21:45] oh enoch was some super special powerful
[1:21:48] that's why he was able to walk that's
[1:21:49] why he was what was he brother branham
[1:21:51] said
[1:21:52] he was a son
[1:21:54] of god
[1:21:55] he was an eagle that had been called for
[1:21:58] that day
[1:22:00] everything that god told him to do he
[1:22:03] went and done it no argument about it he
[1:22:07] just
[1:22:08] went
[1:22:09] and done it
[1:22:11] help me lord
[1:22:14] because i feel like that's one of the
[1:22:15] biggest issues how many times does god
[1:22:17] move on our heart to do something
[1:22:20] and maybe it's just small
[1:22:22] maybe it's just an unction
[1:22:25] and so
[1:22:26] we push it away
[1:22:27] we figure nah nah surely not
[1:22:31] when enoch heard an auction from god he
[1:22:33] just went and done it
[1:22:36] church today we have to learn how to
[1:22:37] hear that unction again too many of us
[1:22:39] have gotten out of tune with that
[1:22:40] unction it's because what we feed on
[1:22:42] what we listen to there's so many voices
[1:22:44] maybe not even sinful voices maybe not
[1:22:46] even worldly things but it's this voice
[1:22:48] and that voice and politics and news and
[1:22:51] this and that and we're missing the
[1:22:52] unction because those voices are so loud
[1:22:54] those voices are blaring those voices
[1:22:56] are out there and there's an unction
[1:22:57] telling you move
[1:22:59] move today move deeper in me move away
[1:23:02] from those things move deeper into the
[1:23:04] promises of god
[1:23:07] we have to do more here than live
[1:23:10] the beginning of these verses talk about
[1:23:11] enoch living
[1:23:13] but at the end it talks about enoch
[1:23:14] walking
[1:23:15] so we have to do more than live we have
[1:23:17] to do more than occupy we have to be
[1:23:20] progressing we have to be led and being
[1:23:24] led means that you are moving
[1:23:27] all right no matter i could put a rope
[1:23:28] around brother joe and i could pull on
[1:23:30] him as hard as i want to he's not being
[1:23:32] led as long as he sits in that chair
[1:23:34] there is someone trying to lead him
[1:23:36] there is someone pulling at his heart
[1:23:38] too many times we we mistake the pulling
[1:23:40] on our heart as us being led that's not
[1:23:42] being led that's god trying to lead you
[1:23:45] all right but it's not just leadership
[1:23:46] we have to be willing to submit to that
[1:23:49] leadership how many times do things get
[1:23:51] turned sideways and upside down and we
[1:23:53] say why god why why didn't you say
[1:23:55] something he's going are you kidding me
[1:23:59] i've been trying to move you away from
[1:24:00] that situation for a decade
[1:24:03] i've been trying to move you away from
[1:24:04] there for years for months and weeks and
[1:24:06] you just wouldn't listen you weren't
[1:24:08] willing to move
[1:24:10] your lips may have said you were this
[1:24:11] may have said you were but you were not
[1:24:13] willing to do what i ask you to do
[1:24:17] we have to be led
[1:24:19] we have to be moving that means you must
[1:24:22] be growing
[1:24:23] you must be walking you must be
[1:24:26] performing the will of god it means we
[1:24:29] are not to be where we were 10 years ago
[1:24:36] it means you are not to be where you
[1:24:37] were five years ago
[1:24:39] you are not to be where you were one
[1:24:42] year ago
[1:24:44] if you are
[1:24:46] it's time to move
[1:24:48] it's time to move
[1:24:50] listen god is always moving and yet he's
[1:24:53] never changing
[1:24:56] his promises are true his promises are
[1:24:58] steadfast he doesn't move away from
[1:25:00] those promises but he moves into them he
[1:25:03] moves deeper into his word he moves
[1:25:05] farther into the promised land he moves
[1:25:08] further away from egypt he is constantly
[1:25:10] moving and yet he is never changing and
[1:25:13] he's always leading his people forward
[1:25:16] where to where are we going brother
[1:25:17] aaron towards the ultimate goal he's
[1:25:19] leading you towards a rapture he's
[1:25:21] leading you towards a body change so
[1:25:23] many times we're holding on to these
[1:25:25] little bitty things and he's saying
[1:25:27] child don't you see what's right here at
[1:25:28] the end of the road i have a body change
[1:25:30] for you i have a deliverance for you i
[1:25:33] have the ultimate healing for you it's a
[1:25:35] body change it's a rapture i've gone to
[1:25:37] prepare a place for you can we not this
[1:25:39] morning just release our wants release
[1:25:42] our desires release the things we're
[1:25:43] holding on to and say god take me to
[1:25:45] that i'm hungry for that i'm desiring
[1:25:48] that i want to go home i want to change
[1:25:50] i want a new body but you got to let go
[1:25:52] this morning and begin moving
[1:25:55] begin walking
[1:25:59] we got to be moving towards the finish
[1:26:01] line
[1:26:02] and we can't be a people who drive our
[1:26:04] tent stakes down too deep
[1:26:07] to where we get too comfortable right
[1:26:08] where we're camped at
[1:26:10] even if it's at a place of great victory
[1:26:15] even if it's a place of great victory
[1:26:17] look many of us have experienced great
[1:26:19] victories where we're walking with god
[1:26:21] and god came down and did something so
[1:26:23] mighty and miraculous in our life and it
[1:26:25] was so wonderful and yet we stay
[1:26:28] right there
[1:26:30] we glory and we praise the lord for it
[1:26:33] and yet we look up and five years later
[1:26:34] that's our last testimony
[1:26:36] that's the last time god spoke to us
[1:26:38] that's the last time we've moved it's a
[1:26:40] wonderful thing that happened i believe
[1:26:42] in testifying of the past i believe in
[1:26:44] pointing to it as a god that does
[1:26:47] wonderful things but what has he done
[1:26:48] for you today what has been your
[1:26:50] communication with god today what has he
[1:26:52] spoken to your heart today where has he
[1:26:54] moved you from today
[1:26:56] and yet many people are camped down at
[1:26:58] their last great victory
[1:27:01] or even they've camped down at the place
[1:27:03] of a great truth
[1:27:05] that's what happened to men down through
[1:27:06] the ages
[1:27:08] they camped on a great truth a wonderful
[1:27:10] revelation
[1:27:12] listen standing where you were standing
[1:27:15] 15 years ago and preaching the exact
[1:27:17] same thing you preached 15 years ago is
[1:27:19] not something to be proud of
[1:27:23] you have not had anything deeper or more
[1:27:26] opened up to you
[1:27:28] as a christian you haven't walked you
[1:27:29] have an advance i'm standing right where
[1:27:31] i stood 15 years ago brother shame
[1:27:35] why haven't we moved why haven't we
[1:27:37] progressed why haven't we went further
[1:27:38] why haven't we grown
[1:27:45] we can't be there
[1:27:47] many have great testimonies of what god
[1:27:49] did and yet that's where they still are
[1:27:52] and on the other side of that many
[1:27:53] people get stuck
[1:27:55] in the place of great tragedy
[1:27:58] in a great tragedy will strike their
[1:28:00] family and the rest of their life their
[1:28:02] life is formed and revolves around that
[1:28:04] tragedy
[1:28:05] well i am this way because this is what
[1:28:07] happened to me no no you are the way you
[1:28:09] are because we choose to be what we are
[1:28:16] i know i know what about i was raised in
[1:28:19] this home and i was done this and this
[1:28:20] happened you are the way you are because
[1:28:23] you choose to be what you are
[1:28:26] that's why you are the way you are
[1:28:30] and yet we camp down on this hurt or
[1:28:32] this thing that happened we allow it to
[1:28:34] mold us because we never allowed
[1:28:36] ourselves to be led out of that
[1:28:38] situation by the pillar of fire that
[1:28:40] says child i know that hurts i know
[1:28:42] that's horrible but come with me i'll be
[1:28:44] the bomb in gilead come with me i'll
[1:28:45] heal that hurt come with me i'll wrap my
[1:28:47] arms around you move on from that place
[1:28:49] i've got greater things for you walk
[1:28:51] with me grow with me and suddenly even
[1:28:54] though that thing will always be a part
[1:28:56] of your life it is not what defines your
[1:28:58] life but your relationship with jesus
[1:29:00] christ defines your life because you're
[1:29:01] walking and you're growing and you're
[1:29:03] moving and he's changing you from glory
[1:29:05] to glory and you're becoming more and
[1:29:07] more like jesus christ
[1:29:15] down through the ages we find both kinds
[1:29:17] of people
[1:29:20] those willing to move
[1:29:23] and those unwilling to move
[1:29:26] god would send a messenger direct to
[1:29:29] each age
[1:29:31] with greater illumination and greater
[1:29:32] revelation than the last
[1:29:35] he would send a messenger with a mighty
[1:29:37] message but when that man
[1:29:39] would depart and go off the scene
[1:29:41] instantly they would organize that work
[1:29:43] and they would stake their tents down
[1:29:45] right there
[1:29:47] and the light would move on to the next
[1:29:48] messenger in the next age
[1:29:51] and amongst those who would receive that
[1:29:53] message
[1:29:54] some would walk and grow with it
[1:29:58] i want you to get that they would walk
[1:30:00] and grow with it
[1:30:05] some would camp down on the very first
[1:30:06] part they heard and say this is the
[1:30:08] truth and i won't move from it
[1:30:10] well they were right they did have a
[1:30:12] truth
[1:30:14] they camped down on a truth
[1:30:16] that is absolutely correct
[1:30:18] but in that truth they drove down their
[1:30:20] tent stakes so deep that they were
[1:30:22] unable to move on to further revelation
[1:30:26] even within each age within each message
[1:30:29] there is
[1:30:31] growth
[1:30:35] there is to be progression
[1:30:37] the growth isn't just from age to age
[1:30:43] it's not just from age to age but within
[1:30:45] each age within each stage there is to
[1:30:48] be growth
[1:30:50] because in each age there is further
[1:30:52] unveiling of god that takes place to
[1:30:54] each individual
[1:30:56] but there is a certain amount of growth
[1:30:58] that takes place once again within
[1:31:01] each stage so many times we think
[1:31:03] martin had
[1:31:05] this and it was that little thing and
[1:31:07] they got it all at once and then it
[1:31:08] moved
[1:31:09] and then we got this and it was all
[1:31:11] revealed all at once and then that's all
[1:31:13] of it
[1:31:14] but no there's growth that takes place
[1:31:17] so there was those that followed the
[1:31:19] message of luther's day that advanced
[1:31:22] and grew more than others that claimed
[1:31:24] to believe the same message
[1:31:27] there were followers of luther that were
[1:31:30] more advanced than other followers of
[1:31:32] luther
[1:31:33] there were followers of wesley that were
[1:31:36] true followers that were more advanced
[1:31:38] than other followers of wesley although
[1:31:40] they were under the same message
[1:31:42] they were walking under and moving under
[1:31:45] that message
[1:31:47] listen on the way to the promised land
[1:31:49] and we'll say this more than once today
[1:31:51] they had to move constantly that didn't
[1:31:52] mean they had a new messenger
[1:31:54] it didn't mean the message changed but
[1:31:57] underneath that message the pillar of
[1:31:58] fire moved underneath that message
[1:32:01] corners were turned
[1:32:03] underneath that message one day they
[1:32:05] were worshiping one way and the next day
[1:32:07] they were dancing on the banks of the
[1:32:08] red sea
[1:32:10] because they moved underneath that
[1:32:13] message and that messenger
[1:32:16] because they were walking with god they
[1:32:19] progressed further than those who staked
[1:32:22] down
[1:32:23] they didn't put a period after their
[1:32:25] revelation but they allowed it to
[1:32:26] continually unfold as god allowed it to
[1:32:30] as far as god was allowed to underneath
[1:32:32] the revelation for that day
[1:32:36] and then as the wheat grew
[1:32:38] there was an advancement into wesley's
[1:32:40] day and the message for that hour
[1:32:43] and those willing to move moved right in
[1:32:46] those not willing dried up right there
[1:32:49] where they were
[1:32:52] and some come in and said this is the
[1:32:53] truth right here and they buried their
[1:32:55] tent stakes and they grew no more
[1:32:58] that's where they stayed
[1:33:00] but those willing to move grew in the
[1:33:02] light of the word as it advanced within
[1:33:04] its stage towards the next stage
[1:33:08] and even if they were someone that was
[1:33:10] called under that age and they couldn't
[1:33:12] advance to the next stage themselves or
[1:33:13] see the next one they grew as far as
[1:33:16] that light would allow them to
[1:33:19] all right understand that it's not just
[1:33:21] here's the revelation for the age but
[1:33:23] they walked as far as they were able to
[1:33:26] walk in the light of that day whereas
[1:33:29] some people staked down as soon as they
[1:33:30] saw the first little bit of light
[1:33:33] but they walked
[1:33:34] and they grew and that's the exact same
[1:33:37] thing that has happened in our day there
[1:33:39] is a moving and there is a growing that
[1:33:42] has taken place in this age in this hour
[1:33:46] there is revelation that has come to
[1:33:48] this age not not a new revelation that
[1:33:51] the prophet didn't bring we're not
[1:33:53] saying that any anyway but a people who
[1:33:55] actually eat from the book that became
[1:33:58] opened
[1:33:59] people that actually saw the book is
[1:34:01] open instead of going
[1:34:03] [Applause]
[1:34:08] yay
[1:34:10] did you know the book's open brother joe
[1:34:13] so does everyone else that proclaims to
[1:34:15] believe the message but most of them
[1:34:16] don't know what's in it
[1:34:20] because that's as far as they went the
[1:34:22] book's open
[1:34:23] but he's calling you today he's saying
[1:34:24] now come come take the book there's a
[1:34:26] part for you to play you gotta move you
[1:34:28] gotta feed you gotta come take the book
[1:34:31] got to move in this word you got to let
[1:34:32] this word take on flesh you have to
[1:34:34] become the the bone of his bone and the
[1:34:36] flesh of his flesh you you not just yea

[1:34:55] you have to move it's not just god sent
[1:34:57] a prophet thank god he sent a prophet
[1:35:00] thank god he did but at that point when
[1:35:03] people accepted that and they stopped
[1:35:04] there they stayed in an infant state but
[1:35:07] god can't come back he's not coming back
[1:35:09] to marry an infant there is to be a
[1:35:11] mature word bride living and breathing
[1:35:14] and walking on the earth that has fed on
[1:35:16] the word and who has grown up in
[1:35:18] maturity because they have walked and
[1:35:20] they have continued to grow in the light
[1:35:22] of this last day
[1:35:24] it's not an infant broad on the earth
[1:35:28] because there's a people instead of just
[1:35:30] saying god sent a prophet and his name
[1:35:32] is william branham that they've actually
[1:35:34] grown and moved on underneath the
[1:35:37] message that he actually delivered
[1:35:40] they've actually allowed it to come in
[1:35:42] them and change their life and grow from
[1:35:44] glory to glory
[1:35:50] to where it's not just an infant bride
[1:35:52] on the earth anymore
[1:35:54] but it's a mature
[1:35:56] elect lady
[1:35:58] that is coming to her position growing
[1:36:00] and moving under the message of malachi
[1:36:02] 4.
[1:36:04] oh but brother aaron you don't
[1:36:05] understand
[1:36:07] we've
[1:36:08] arrived
[1:36:10] we're here
[1:36:12] there is nothing more for us to attain
[1:36:15] that's the exact same attitude that
[1:36:17] denominated every other age
[1:36:20] it's the exact same attitude that caused
[1:36:22] them to dry up and die every age prior
[1:36:24] to us couldn't go any further because
[1:36:26] they said
[1:36:27] this is it
[1:36:29] there is no more
[1:36:30] and when when god would move on they
[1:36:32] would say that's not of god
[1:36:35] this is god
[1:36:36] that's not god this is that's why when
[1:36:39] people are won't move with the spirit
[1:36:40] and they see you move they see you run
[1:36:42] shout dance they go that's not god
[1:36:47] because they're unwilling to move
[1:36:52] he said in deuteronomy 1 7
[1:36:55] turn you
[1:36:58] not a new message
[1:37:00] not a new messenger
[1:37:02] but a corner was turned
[1:37:04] a direction changed
[1:37:06] and you know men in our nature have
[1:37:09] problems
[1:37:11] not picking on the men humanity how
[1:37:13] about that
[1:37:14] in our nature have problems turning
[1:37:16] corners
[1:37:18] we have problems when god moves in a
[1:37:20] certain way for so long
[1:37:22] accepting when he moves in another way
[1:37:25] or when he does something else
[1:37:27] no no no that's not god because this is
[1:37:29] god
[1:37:31] well why can't this be god and that be
[1:37:34] god
[1:37:38] why does he have to move within your
[1:37:39] little shoebox within your little box of
[1:37:41] how god does things god said turn
[1:37:45] he said turn you've been in that same
[1:37:47] place way too long you've been standing
[1:37:49] there too long and he's telling you to
[1:37:50] turn a direction has been changed and
[1:37:53] people have a problem changing
[1:37:55] directions and usually what you'll find
[1:37:57] is men who can't turn corners will
[1:38:00] always criticize those that do
[1:38:04] men who can't turn a corner will always
[1:38:06] point at the ones who do turn corners
[1:38:08] and say they're compromisers or they're
[1:38:10] going backwards or they've gotten off
[1:38:12] the word when in reality the ones who
[1:38:14] turn the corners or the one who saw the
[1:38:16] movement of the pillar of fire and they
[1:38:17] said come on church take up your kent
[1:38:19] stakes pack up the camp it's time to
[1:38:21] move this morning it's time to go god's
[1:38:23] doing something and i don't want to be
[1:38:25] left right here i don't want to be left
[1:38:27] behind he's moving on
[1:38:30] can you imagine can you imagine being
[1:38:32] there in egypt
[1:38:34] and and putting blood upon the doorpost
[1:38:37] because that's what the message told you
[1:38:39] to do
[1:38:40] and then the next day they gather
[1:38:42] everyone together and they're marching
[1:38:44] out
[1:38:45] and we're standing there going
[1:38:47] look at them fanatics
[1:38:49] the message was to put blood on the
[1:38:51] doorpost
[1:38:52] where are y'all going
[1:38:55] you're leaving the message
[1:38:57] you're leaving them as the message put
[1:38:59] said put blood on the doorpost so i'm
[1:39:00] going to stay here every day and put
[1:39:02] blood on the doorpost where do you think
[1:39:04] you're going fanatics
[1:39:08] why are you moving what's wrong with
[1:39:10] them did the message not say put blood
[1:39:12] on the doorpost i'm with the message
[1:39:20] but the message turned the corner and
[1:39:23] said it's time to leave it's time to go
[1:39:26] and people who can see you said i'm
[1:39:28] going i'm leaving i'm not staying here
[1:39:30] another day i thank god for the flood on
[1:39:32] the dorm post i thank god for that but
[1:39:35] today the message said get up and get
[1:39:37] out and i'm moving with the pillar of
[1:39:40] fire today
[1:39:40] [Applause]
[1:39:47] i'm glad that we're at a place where
[1:39:48] we're allowed to grow
[1:39:51] i'm glad that we can advance
[1:39:53] because as long as we're still here
[1:39:55] there's more to accomplish
[1:39:56] if we had achieved it all we wouldn't
[1:39:59] still be here
[1:40:00] but there's more to grass more to
[1:40:02] accomplish more people to reach
[1:40:04] there's more power of the gospel for
[1:40:06] each and every one of us there's more
[1:40:08] for us to experience there's more for
[1:40:09] evening like tabernacle to do there's
[1:40:11] more for the bride of jesus christ to do
[1:40:13] that's why we're still here
[1:40:15] that's why we have to continue moving
[1:40:18] look you're never going to get to the
[1:40:20] promised land staying where you're at
[1:40:23] unless you think where you're at is the
[1:40:25] promised land
[1:40:27] you got ripped off
[1:40:36] branham says
[1:40:37] i've noticed among our brethren that
[1:40:39] many of you
[1:40:40] as coming into the full gospel people
[1:40:42] coming from the baptist church myself
[1:40:45] excuse me
[1:40:47] and accepting the doctrine of the
[1:40:48] baptism of the holy ghost being a
[1:40:50] separate work of the holy spirit
[1:40:53] and i thought then
[1:40:55] when the martin luther reached
[1:40:56] justification by faith he thought that
[1:40:58] settled it
[1:41:00] that was the light for his day and he
[1:41:02] preached it and believed it and held on
[1:41:04] to it and it was the light of that day
[1:41:05] then he entered another veil a man john
[1:41:07] wesley
[1:41:08] when calvinism began to sweep the nation
[1:41:12] and they'd settle down to saying what
[1:41:14] god's going to do he will do and it does
[1:41:16] that's no good to have a revival god
[1:41:18] raised up john wesley and he certainly
[1:41:20] smashed calvinism to the ground
[1:41:23] to the other places where it ought to
[1:41:24] have been in its right balance under the
[1:41:27] works of sanctification the second work
[1:41:29] of grace nazarene's carried it on and
[1:41:31] along come the pentecostals then next
[1:41:33] and the baptism of the holy ghost moving
[1:41:36] on up into higher heights
[1:41:39] and now when the brethren received the
[1:41:41] baptism of the holy ghost they said this
[1:41:42] is the summit this is all of it but
[1:41:45] brethren that's wrong see
[1:41:48] there is no summit to god's power
[1:41:53] there is no summit we move on and on and
[1:41:57] on it's the unlimited resources of god
[1:42:01] has never been tapped yet blessings and
[1:42:04] powers that we know nothing about it's
[1:42:06] never even been revealed to archangels
[1:42:09] and it's laying just ahead for his
[1:42:11] church that will believe i think i'll
[1:42:14] stay right here no sir he said it's
[1:42:16] laying just ahead things that hadn't
[1:42:18] even been revealed to archangels he said
[1:42:20] there's no limit to it i say today we
[1:42:22] move towards it i say today we get up
[1:42:24] and we go and we march and we don't stop
[1:42:27] until we're living in the glories of god
[1:42:29] living overcoming lives living and
[1:42:32] breathing victorious christians the
[1:42:34] bride of jesus christ in flesh because
[1:42:37] it's all just ahead of us
[1:42:39] but you're not gonna get it sitting
[1:42:40] where you're at this morning
[1:42:42] he says for i has not seen ear has not
[1:42:44] heard neither has it entered the hearts
[1:42:46] of men what god has for them
[1:42:49] in store that love him so let's move up
[1:42:52] and claim our rights as god opens the
[1:42:54] gates and swings out the welcome mat
[1:42:56] let's move on up into deeper depths and
[1:42:58] never colonize ourselves to organize
[1:43:00] ourselves
[1:43:01] and to get into a place where this is
[1:43:04] well we believe this and that's all
[1:43:06] let's believe this
[1:43:08] plus how much more we can hear from god
[1:43:12] let's believe this
[1:43:14] plus
[1:43:15] let's believe in door blood on the
[1:43:17] doorpost plus leave in egypt
[1:43:20] let's believe what god has today plus i
[1:43:23] think that ought to be the motive of
[1:43:24] every man and woman that loves the lord
[1:43:26] jesus
[1:43:27] to receive all that you can from the
[1:43:30] hand of his bountiful mercies that's
[1:43:33] my heart he says
[1:43:37] in churches many times they'd never say
[1:43:39] it
[1:43:40] but you can see the attitude of well
[1:43:43] this is all there is to it
[1:43:45] by the fact that the church is dead
[1:43:47] that's right
[1:43:49] there is no moving in the spirit there
[1:43:50] are no baptisms there are no repentances
[1:43:52] there are no healings there is no
[1:43:54] nothing
[1:43:56] and there's nothing going on
[1:43:58] nothing
[1:44:00] brother aaron you just want every
[1:44:02] service to be people running and
[1:44:03] shouting absolutely not
[1:44:06] but i expect there to be life
[1:44:09] i expect to see lives changed
[1:44:11] i expect to see overcomers i expect to
[1:44:14] see sinners weeping their way to calvary
[1:44:16] i expect to see the things the gospel
[1:44:18] promised actually happen
[1:44:20] forgive me for believing that the word
[1:44:22] is true
[1:44:24] and that those things are supposed to
[1:44:25] happen amongst believers
[1:44:27] it's not often spoken but it reflects in
[1:44:30] the fact that there's a dead church
[1:44:32] and once you settle down to that you
[1:44:34] become comfortable with that then the
[1:44:35] pillar of fire moves on
[1:44:37] the pillar of fire will not settle over
[1:44:40] a dead church
[1:44:42] brother brown says they followed the
[1:44:44] pillar of fire they kept it in the will
[1:44:46] of the lord by do they kept in the will
[1:44:48] of the lord by doing so how beautiful
[1:44:52] through 1500 years of dark ages though
[1:44:54] they failed to see it but there was a
[1:44:56] fellow one day by the name of martin
[1:44:57] luther he saw the pillar of fire and
[1:44:59] away he went on the first reformation
[1:45:02] but you know what he organized his
[1:45:04] church so tight it began to be
[1:45:07] to only the lutheran church you was
[1:45:09] either lutheran or you wasn't in it
[1:45:11] pillar of fire won't hang over nothing
[1:45:13] like that
[1:45:14] so away it went luther couldn't follow
[1:45:16] it because luther had been dead for
[1:45:18] years and another round of servants and
[1:45:20] apostles or apostles of the church in
[1:45:22] another round and another round weakened
[1:45:24] down just like the disciples and the
[1:45:27] pillar of fire moved away from the
[1:45:29] lutheran church luther couldn't go
[1:45:31] because he had all his rituals and
[1:45:33] everything rode up
[1:45:36] then there was a little fellow by the
[1:45:37] name of john wesley in england he saw it
[1:45:40] and the way he went and he had a revival
[1:45:42] that saved england the united states the
[1:45:44] english known world in that day the
[1:45:46] wesley revival wesley george whitfield
[1:45:48] oh asbury many of them they had that
[1:45:51] great revival and then the first thing
[1:45:52] you know they got so organized down
[1:45:55] until they began to get after to get
[1:45:57] after a few rounds just as cold and
[1:46:00] starchy as they could be
[1:46:02] why is it that he always equates cold
[1:46:05] and starchy with denominationalism
[1:46:08] because it's den
[1:46:12] brother aaron what do you think every
[1:46:14] message church should be
[1:46:15] alive
[1:46:18] how that life shows itself in your
[1:46:20] church is not for me to say
[1:46:22] but i know that it always showed itself
[1:46:24] the same in the bible
[1:46:25] so if we're going to go by the bible
[1:46:27] standard i have a pretty good idea of
[1:46:29] how it should show itself alive in your
[1:46:30] church and it should not be cold and
[1:46:32] starchy
[1:46:35] he said that's right the pillar of fire
[1:46:37] won't hang over that let's read that
[1:46:39] again
[1:46:40] they was just as cold and starchy as
[1:46:42] they could be that's right the pillar of
[1:46:45] fire won't hang over that so away it
[1:46:48] went and a bunch of people called
[1:46:49] pentecostals seen it and away they went
[1:46:51] after it and they built them a church
[1:46:53] under it but you know the sad part the
[1:46:55] pentecostals are so organized the pillow
[1:46:57] fire is moving out again and they can't
[1:46:59] go that's right but the pillar of fire
[1:47:02] is moving anyhow
[1:47:03] god said it would that's right they had
[1:47:05] the sign of the fire by night and the
[1:47:07] cloud by day that led them listen the
[1:47:09] pillar of fire is moving anyhow you can
[1:47:13] try to sit down on it you can sit there
[1:47:15] and fold your arms and say i ain't going
[1:47:17] that's okay somebody always sees it and
[1:47:19] goes with it some sat down and said this
[1:47:22] is it i won't move i'm not gonna worship
[1:47:24] like that that's okay you won't hinder
[1:47:26] me because the pillar of fire is moving
[1:47:28] on anyhow and i'm going with it today
[1:47:31] i'm marching where the pillar of fire
[1:47:33] tells me to go
[1:47:36] and that's been the problem so many have
[1:47:38] camped down through the ages but there's
[1:47:40] always been somebody that was willing to
[1:47:42] go
[1:47:43] always somebody who wasn't ashamed to
[1:47:45] walk in the light always been somebody
[1:47:47] who wasn't ashamed to worship in spirit
[1:47:51] and in truth
[1:47:52] [Music]
[1:47:53] i believe there's a people today all
[1:47:54] around the world that are still growing
[1:47:56] that are still progressing that are
[1:47:58] still maturing that are still being led
[1:48:00] by the holy spirit in this day
[1:48:02] why because we cannot continue to
[1:48:04] perpetuate the ages we can't do what the
[1:48:07] other ages did they didn't rapture you
[1:48:10] won't either if you do the same thing
[1:48:13] but god said i will have a bride he said
[1:48:17] there will be overcomers in laodicea i
[1:48:20] say it might as well be me it might as
[1:48:22] well be you i'm going to set my eyes on
[1:48:24] the pillar of fire and i'm going to move
[1:48:26] today i'm going to go where it goes i'm
[1:48:29] going to stop where it stops but i'm
[1:48:31] always going to be ready to move when it
[1:48:33] moves again
[1:48:34] [Music]
[1:48:39] there is a people moving forward today
[1:48:41] under the leadership of the pillar of
[1:48:43] fire
[1:48:44] people who are looking away from
[1:48:46] circumstances
[1:48:47] people who are willing to look away from
[1:48:49] politics
[1:48:50] and get their eyes on the fact that the
[1:48:52] pillar of fire is still moving
[1:48:54] oh but there's a c in the way he said
[1:48:56] speak that they go
[1:48:58] forward but what are we going to do
[1:49:00] about food when we get over there go
[1:49:02] forward
[1:49:03] what about water there's no water in the
[1:49:05] desert go forward but what about go
[1:49:07] forward
[1:49:08] but you don't understand go forward
[1:49:11] we could have a lot of what ifs in the
[1:49:12] day we live
[1:49:13] oh but there's so many people falling
[1:49:15] away go forward
[1:49:16] there's ten thousand fallen on this side
[1:49:18] and a thousand go forward today but look
[1:49:21] at politics in the government and covet
[1:49:23] go forward
[1:49:24] but what about my situation go forward
[1:49:26] trust the pillar of fire he said we were
[1:49:28] going to the other side i say go forward
[1:49:32] you can trust this god today you can
[1:49:34] have faith in him today just go forward
[1:49:39] that's what a mature bride does
[1:49:41] she presses on a mature people willing
[1:49:44] to move when the pillar of fire moves
[1:49:48] the move
[1:49:50] is on
[1:49:51] for the bride
[1:49:54] he says some of you people that really
[1:49:55] believe this to be the truth that we're
[1:49:57] entering another age we're entering the
[1:49:59] rapture age you know the church can't go
[1:50:01] in its condition and it can't get any
[1:50:03] better it must get worse how many knows
[1:50:06] that
[1:50:08] it's got to get worse it can't go like
[1:50:10] this see it's got to be something and
[1:50:12] it's moving right now friend
[1:50:15] it's
[1:50:16] it's on

[1:50:19] truth that's thus

[1:50:34] moment that the move is on for the bride

[1:50:38] getting closer than it's ever been to
[1:50:39] going home time the prophet would say
[1:50:41] the train is in the blocks it's the
[1:50:43] flashing red lights but the sign of is

[1:51:10] in egypt for 400 years
[1:51:13] and all things seemed to be as they had
[1:51:15] always been
[1:51:17] to those that can't see with a spiritual
[1:51:19] eye
[1:51:21] and those who have lost their faith and
[1:51:23] lost their way

[1:51:42] because the complex of how fat i am
[1:51:44] but then i looked in the mirror and
[1:51:45] realized it didn't help
[1:51:47] so i might as well take it off
[1:51:51] nice
[1:51:52] might as well be cool
[1:51:53] that jacket didn't help nothing
[1:52:01] you get your eye off of spiritual things
[1:52:04] get in trouble
[1:52:06] they get their awful spiritual things
[1:52:08] and they don't see that nothing's going
[1:52:09] on
[1:52:10] they don't realize that nothing's
[1:52:11] happening
[1:52:12] to the point that most didn't even
[1:52:15] think about a delivery anymore
[1:52:17] i wonder truly and i know there's many
[1:52:19] of you you can say oh i do i do and i
[1:52:20] believe you
[1:52:22] i wonder if every one of us every single
[1:52:25] day spend a lot of time thinking about
[1:52:27] the rapture
[1:52:31] or if we've gotten so beat down
[1:52:33] so caught up in life so trapped in a
[1:52:35] slave mentality if i gotta go make
[1:52:36] bricks for pharaoh
[1:52:39] that we forgot there's a deliverance
[1:52:40] promise
[1:52:41] we forgot there's a promise and we
[1:52:44] forgot that it's gonna happen no matter
[1:52:47] what's going on on thursday at work
[1:52:49] no matter what happened on tuesday at
[1:52:51] work no matter what went on in the
[1:52:53] argument that happened in your home
[1:52:56] that has nothing to do with the promise
[1:52:59] and some got to the point where they
[1:53:01] didn't even think about the deliverer
[1:53:02] anymore
[1:53:03] so beat down consumed with the slave
[1:53:06] mentality
[1:53:07] but there were still some there that
[1:53:08] were ready to move
[1:53:10] there was some that hadn't given up hope
[1:53:14] i'm one of those this morning
[1:53:16] prophet of god says little old frail
[1:53:17] body lost a lot of weight
[1:53:20] up the creaky steps he goes he goes over
[1:53:22] there and kneels down
[1:53:24] and he says oh jehovah
[1:53:26] and i love the way brother brown says
[1:53:28] that he speaks to jehovah
[1:53:31] because it's in real talk
[1:53:34] you don't got to be fancy
[1:53:36] listen to what brother brown says he
[1:53:38] says
[1:53:39] he prayed like he'd never prayed before
[1:53:41] he said jehovah
[1:53:43] looky here
[1:53:46] looky here
[1:53:48] you're a real god
[1:53:50] we believe you got ears we believe you
[1:53:52] got eyes and you know all things and we
[1:53:55] believe you're the god of the hebrews
[1:53:57] and we're the people of the promise we
[1:53:59] believe you keep your word said look at
[1:54:01] the heathens out here and how they're
[1:54:03] taking cheap labor and building great
[1:54:05] big roads and idols and everything you
[1:54:07] jehovah would you sit in heaven and let
[1:54:09] the heathen rule over us i don't believe
[1:54:12] you'll do it amen brother brown says i
[1:54:14] still don't believe he'll do it amen
[1:54:16] when the devil comes in god is still god
[1:54:20] remember that this morning when the
[1:54:22] devil's coming after you god is still
[1:54:24] god you are still his child you still
[1:54:27] have every right promise to you you have
[1:54:29] the authority to stand look the devil in
[1:54:31] the eye and say back up get off my
[1:54:33] property i'm moving this morning i'm
[1:54:35] taking another step you back off because
[1:54:38] god is still god
[1:54:40] he says right he will not permit the
[1:54:42] devil to do that i believe it's the day
[1:54:45] that when fashion and nonsense and all
[1:54:47] this tommy rot's going on still god
[1:54:50] reigns and he's still god right what we
[1:54:53] need somebody like hamram got the burden
[1:54:55] on their heart who will stay there and
[1:54:57] pray it through until the heavens has
[1:54:59] split open you under god comes down and
[1:55:02] answers prayers amen
[1:55:05] evening like tabernacle move today move
[1:55:08] under a burden of prayer move to a
[1:55:10] deeper sincerity move to a deeper
[1:55:12] consecration somebody that'll begin to
[1:55:14] pray god this is your word fulfill your
[1:55:17] word move lord you see how the heathen
[1:55:19] rage you see how they're trying to ruin
[1:55:21] this and ruin that and keep us down but
[1:55:23] i don't believe you're gonna let it
[1:55:25] happen today because god is still god
[1:55:28] there's gonna be somebody that falls to
[1:55:30] their knees and begins to pray god
[1:55:32] fulfill your word god move in our life
[1:55:34] god send a rapture god send deliver us
[1:55:37] we're believing we're praying we haven't
[1:55:39] given up we're holding on we're moving
[1:55:41] today we're pressing the battle
[1:55:44] fulfill your word lord
[1:55:47] you promised it we believe it
[1:55:49] [Applause]
[1:55:53] you got to be more like amram
[1:55:56] god you are still god
[1:56:01] that burden had taken a hold of amram's
[1:56:03] heart
[1:56:05] a moving was taking place in his heart
[1:56:08] oh god fulfill your word
[1:56:11] because the time of the promise was
[1:56:13] drawing nigh
[1:56:15] brother brown says also he was told by
[1:56:16] his mother
[1:56:17] of his mysterious birth and how that
[1:56:20] the time of hand had come
[1:56:25] close to the hour that there was to be a
[1:56:27] deliverance amram and joshua the sons
[1:56:30] and daughters of levi began to pray to
[1:56:32] god to send the deliverer
[1:56:35] when you see the time of the promised
[1:56:37] drawing nigh
[1:56:39] it sets people to praying
[1:56:41] and hungering
[1:56:45] acts 7 17 says but when the time of the
[1:56:48] promise
[1:56:49] drew now
[1:56:51] which god had sworn to abraham the
[1:56:53] people grew
[1:56:54] and multiplied in egypt
[1:56:57] the
[1:56:59] time
[1:57:02] hopefully this will give
[1:57:04] faith to some people holding on for
[1:57:05] things
[1:57:08] he's very specific
[1:57:10] when he says the time
[1:57:13] it's amazing to me that an eternal god
[1:57:16] spoke an eternal word that so often
[1:57:18] references time
[1:57:21] all throughout the scriptures we find it
[1:57:24] and it's because that even though he is
[1:57:25] not a time being
[1:57:27] he is a god of perfect timing
[1:57:30] because he recognizes the fact that you
[1:57:32] have to live in a body subject to time
[1:57:35] and so he's a god of perfect timing and
[1:57:37] he has placed something on the inside of
[1:57:39] us that allows us to recognize those
[1:57:42] moments
[1:57:43] predestinated moments in time
[1:57:46] that you an eternal being
[1:57:48] dwelling in a time body
[1:57:50] are able to recognize because god put
[1:57:52] that seed gene on the inside of you
[1:57:55] i can remember the night that my son
[1:57:56] jude was healed of his kidney trouble
[1:57:59] lydia had been out
[1:58:01] and the nursery changing changing him
[1:58:04] and most of you know how his kidneys
[1:58:05] worked or didn't work and how one-on-one
[1:58:07] worked at eight percent and they had
[1:58:08] talked about removing it and
[1:58:11] but she walked in the back door to come
[1:58:12] sit back down service was almost over
[1:58:14] and as she walked in the door she went
[1:58:15] to turn right and the lord spoke to her
[1:58:17] and said it's his time
[1:58:20] now she didn't wait to see if there'd be
[1:58:22] a prayer line
[1:58:23] she didn't wait to see she dropped the
[1:58:25] bags
[1:58:26] right there at the floor on the door
[1:58:28] dropped and to the front she went
[1:58:30] because something on the inside of her
[1:58:31] recognized a predestinated moment how
[1:58:34] wonderful our god is an eternal god with
[1:58:36] an eternal world dealing with eternal
[1:58:38] beings trapped in time bodies and yet he
[1:58:40] puts a seed gene on the inside of us
[1:58:41] that allows us to recognize time moments
[1:58:45] when we have need of him and i'll never
[1:58:48] forget the powerful moment and i
[1:58:50] remember after it was over i remember
[1:58:51] sister vicki telling lydia i know he's
[1:58:54] healed i felt the power of god fall in
[1:58:55] the place it's just little things like
[1:58:57] that that you remember as time goes on
[1:58:59] we take him back to the doctor not too
[1:59:01] long after that and the very doctor that
[1:59:03] had been treating him begins to try to
[1:59:04] explain to us that there's been some
[1:59:06] kind of mistakes and somewhere along the
[1:59:08] way somebody misdiagnosed him
[1:59:11] man you've been treating him for six
[1:59:12] months i don't know
[1:59:19] i found him
[1:59:23] but god allowed her to recognize a
[1:59:24] moment
[1:59:26] he is very time specific
[1:59:29] he
[1:59:30] fulfills his eternal word but it's in
[1:59:32] time moments and over and over and over
[1:59:34] scripture would say at the time
[1:59:37] appointed
[1:59:38] oh brother heron i've been holding on
[1:59:40] for this promise so long
[1:59:42] what he's saying genesis 18 14 is there
[1:59:44] anything too hard for the lord
[1:59:46] at the time appointed
[1:59:50] i will return unto thee according to the
[1:59:52] time of life and sarah shall have a son
[1:59:55] let me encourage you in your struggle
[1:59:58] where you're at what you're dealing with
[1:59:59] there is a point in time for your
[2:00:01] deliverance there's an appointed time
[2:00:03] for your miracle there is a point in
[2:00:04] time that's coming there's a point in
[2:00:06] time for salvation there's an appointed
[2:00:07] time for your children there is an
[2:00:09] appointed time that god's going to move
[2:00:11] on the scene for you and exactly what
[2:00:13] you have need of is going to be taken
[2:00:14] care of in a moment and i believe that
[2:00:15] each and every one of you are going to
[2:00:16] recognize that moment something's going
[2:00:18] to flash on that seat gene you're going
[2:00:20] to say this is it this is the time this
[2:00:22] is the moment and when he moves on your
[2:00:23] behalf you're going to be able to walk
[2:00:25] right into it and play your part and
[2:00:27] move because something is speaking down
[2:00:29] to you that word's calling out to that
[2:00:31] word that life's calling out to that
[2:00:33] life you say this is it i've held on
[2:00:35] i've prayed i believe and here i am my
[2:00:38] moment my miracle my moment right here
[2:00:41] in the presence of almighty god he has a
[2:00:44] time appointed for each and every one of
[2:00:46] you and what you're holding on for
[2:00:53] and the time of the promise had drawn
[2:00:55] now
[2:00:56] and god was going to send a deliverer a
[2:00:58] mighty message
[2:01:00] one that would take them out but one
[2:01:01] that would also take them in
[2:01:04] on this journey there would be times
[2:01:06] that they made camp and stopped
[2:01:10] why brother aaron
[2:01:12] because the pillar of fire stopped
[2:01:15] the pillar of fire stopped and it was
[2:01:16] the pillar of fire doing the leading not
[2:01:19] moses
[2:01:20] and if we could get that back in our
[2:01:22] pulpits
[2:01:23] and we could get that back in our homes
[2:01:26] it's where it was the pillar of fire
[2:01:27] doing the leading
[2:01:28] it was the pillar of fire the holy
[2:01:30] spirit doing the directing
[2:01:32] and it wasn't man going i think this and
[2:01:34] i'm gonna do that and i'm gonna take
[2:01:35] this job and i'm gonna leave this church
[2:01:37] and this and this and this without any
[2:01:39] leadership whatsoever
[2:01:41] then we'd be a place to where we're
[2:01:42] moving and progressing in god instead of
[2:01:44] stuck in a camp somewhere or wandering
[2:01:46] around a mountain that we've been
[2:01:47] wandering around for 40 years and god's
[2:01:49] saying turn this morning
[2:01:51] turn away from that get back under the
[2:01:54] leadership of the holy spirit and begin
[2:01:55] to move
[2:01:58] numbers 9 15
[2:02:00] and on the day that the tabernacle was
[2:02:02] reared up the cloud covered the
[2:02:04] tabernacle
[2:02:05] namely the tent of the testimony
[2:02:08] and at even there was upon the
[2:02:09] tabernacle as it were the appearance of
[2:02:11] fire until the morning
[2:02:13] so it was alway the cloud covered it by
[2:02:16] day in the appearance of fire by night
[2:02:18] and when the cloud was taken up from the
[2:02:20] tabernacle then after that the children
[2:02:22] of israel journeyed and in the place
[2:02:24] where the cloud abode there the children
[2:02:26] of israel pitched their tents
[2:02:29] at the commandment of the lord the
[2:02:30] children of israel journeyed and at the
[2:02:32] commandment of the lord they pitched
[2:02:35] as long as the cloud abode upon the
[2:02:37] tabernacle they rested in their tents
[2:02:40] and when the cloud carried long upon the
[2:02:42] tabernacle many days and the children of
[2:02:44] israel kept the charge of the lord and
[2:02:46] journeyed not
[2:02:47] and so it was when the cloud was a few
[2:02:49] days upon the tabernacle according to
[2:02:50] the commandment of the lord they abode
[2:02:52] in their tents and according to the
[2:02:53] commandments of the lord they journeyed
[2:02:56] and so it was when the cloud abode from
[2:02:59] even until the morning that the cloud
[2:03:01] was taken up in the morning then they
[2:03:03] journeyed whether it was by day or by
[2:03:05] night that the cloud was taken up they
[2:03:07] journeyed or whether it were two days a
[2:03:09] month or a year that the cloud carried
[2:03:11] upon the tabernacle remaining there on
[2:03:13] the children of israel abode in their
[2:03:14] tents
[2:03:15] and journey not but when it was taken up
[2:03:18] they journeyed
[2:03:20] no it wasn't
[2:03:22] it was taken up and they went
[2:03:25] yeah i bet if i stay here a couple more
[2:03:26] days i can catch them
[2:03:28] i can catch up to them i like it here
[2:03:30] this is a nice oasis
[2:03:33] really
[2:03:34] the pillar fires moving at 2 am
[2:03:39] and i gotta move
[2:03:42] no they journeyed
[2:03:44] when it moved they moved when it stopped
[2:03:47] they stopped we have to be a people once
[2:03:49] again led by the pillar of fire
[2:03:52] they were led by the pillar of fire and
[2:03:54] they had to be ready to move whether it
[2:03:56] was convenient whether it was
[2:03:58] unconvenient whether it was comfortable
[2:04:00] whether it was uncomfortable and it
[2:04:02] didn't matter what everybody else in the
[2:04:03] camp thought
[2:04:04] but it's a wednesday night brother aaron
[2:04:06] and it's really it's a teaching service
[2:04:07] and there's nothing going on and the
[2:04:09] lord's moving on me right now i don't
[2:04:10] know what to do i better sit still
[2:04:13] doesn't matter whatever else is doing
[2:04:16] it doesn't really matter
[2:04:18] but the lord moved on me and i was about
[2:04:19] to speak in tongues but i quinced it
[2:04:22] really
[2:04:24] you just admitted that the lord
[2:04:28] moved on you and you quenched it
[2:04:31] boy i wanted to get out of my seat and
[2:04:32] run
[2:04:33] not bad enough
[2:04:35] because you didn't move i saw you
[2:04:40] aaron you're dealing with the motion
[2:04:42] okay
[2:04:43] what i'm dealing with is if god moves on
[2:04:45] you to do something do it
[2:04:47] he moved on me yesterday to go to prayer
[2:04:49] and i had somebody in my heart and i
[2:04:50] knew i should have done it but i got
[2:04:52] caught up in this
[2:04:54] now it doesn't matter when it moves
[2:04:56] it doesn't matter how unreal it seems to
[2:04:58] you or it doesn't make sense just move
[2:05:00] and do what he's asking you to do
[2:05:03] be willing and able to move whenever he
[2:05:07] moves
[2:05:08] it doesn't matter what everyone else is
[2:05:11] doing you can't care what everyone else
[2:05:13] is doing the one who is leading you is
[2:05:15] telling you today it's time for you to
[2:05:18] move is he talking to me you
[2:05:22] it's time for you to move if the pillar
[2:05:24] of fire moves you have to move
[2:05:28] and that's been the failure of the
[2:05:30] church all down through the ages and we
[2:05:32] see in the failure of the church rising
[2:05:34] up once again they camp down on a truth
[2:05:36] they put a period at the end of their
[2:05:38] experience and in so doing they lose the
[2:05:41] leadership of the holy ghost because the
[2:05:43] pillar of fire moves on and they're so
[2:05:45] concerned with where they set up their
[2:05:46] camp they've camped down they put their
[2:05:49] stakes in too deep and the pillar of
[2:05:51] fire moves
[2:05:52] and there they stay
[2:05:55] camp down on truth
[2:05:57] camp down on truth and yet getting no
[2:05:59] closer to the pillar of fire brother joe
[2:06:02] if my ultimate goal
[2:06:04] is to make it out that back door
[2:06:07] and i say but this chair is comfortable
[2:06:12] is that true or these chairs pretty
[2:06:13] comfortable bro joe
[2:06:15] it's a truth it's comfortable
[2:06:17] but you're supposed to go out that back
[2:06:18] door now you don't understand how true
[2:06:20] this is
[2:06:23] this chair is comfortable
[2:06:25] and no matter how long i sit here
[2:06:28] on this truth i will never get any
[2:06:31] closer to that back door
[2:06:33] no matter how long they stayed camped
[2:06:35] down and their truth and it is a truth
[2:06:38] they're not moving towards the promised
[2:06:39] land they are making no progress
[2:06:43] church i don't want to be a sitting duck
[2:06:44] today
[2:06:45] i don't want to be stuck there on the
[2:06:47] ground not willing and not able to move
[2:06:49] sitting still while the enemy gathers
[2:06:51] around sitting still making myself a
[2:06:53] target sitting there while depression
[2:06:55] circles me like hungry wolves
[2:06:57] sitting still why am i so depressed
[2:06:58] because you've been in the same spot for
[2:07:00] 10 years
[2:07:01] you hadn't moved in five years
[2:07:02] depression's got me bound down well
[2:07:04] today get up and move away from that
[2:07:06] spirit move away from that thing move
[2:07:08] away from sickness move away from
[2:07:10] anxiety people get hung up on the same
[2:07:13] old stuff because they're in the same
[2:07:14] old place and they haven't moved in
[2:07:16] years and years and years and they
[2:07:19] wonder why can't i overcome you've never
[2:07:21] got out of the reach of the taskmasters
[2:07:24] you've never moved far enough away from
[2:07:26] egypt
[2:07:29] you're still right there
[2:07:31] they're like whoo-hoo i left egypt the
[2:07:33] egyptians like i see you

[2:08:03] your if your home says you're going to
[2:08:04] be fanatical go forward the church turns
[2:08:07] you out go forward there's no retreating
[2:08:09] back go forward speak go forward speak
[2:08:12] what his word and go forward thus saith
[2:08:16] the lord and move on
[2:08:19] thus saith the lord and move on i love
[2:08:21] that this morning this is going on
[2:08:23] that's going on my trials my trust thus
[2:08:25] saith the lord and move on
[2:08:28] move away from that thing this morning
[2:08:31] the pillar of fire has come back into
[2:08:33] the church and it's still moving and
[2:08:35] it's still leading and it's guiding and
[2:08:36] it's doing the same exact things that it
[2:08:38] did in the bible
[2:08:40] it's producing the exact same works that
[2:08:42] it did in brother branham's ministry
[2:08:44] the word is preached and healings take
[2:08:46] place
[2:08:47] the word is preached and people are
[2:08:48] filled with the holy ghost the word is
[2:08:50] preached and you see deliverances
[2:08:52] the word is priests and there's
[2:08:53] salvation the word is preached and you
[2:08:56] see an outpouring of the gifts of the
[2:08:58] spirit i'm not ashamed to say that
[2:09:00] you see the gifts poured out when the
[2:09:02] word is preached and if you aren't
[2:09:04] seeing those things if you aren't
[2:09:06] experiencing those things it's because
[2:09:08] you've camped out where you are right
[2:09:10] now for far too long
[2:09:13] you've been there too long and
[2:09:15] you can't become a mature word bride
[2:09:18] sitting there at the age of seven
[2:09:21] you've grown none you've moved none
[2:09:25] and yet we are to be a mature word bride
[2:09:27] we say he's coming back for me you gotta
[2:09:28] reach maturity
[2:09:32] oh we're a mature word broad church
[2:09:34] brother aaron and yet the law sit there
[2:09:36] and stay lost
[2:09:39] demons torment the young people
[2:09:41] lust and pornography runs unchecked
[2:09:44] nothing's said about it nothing dealt
[2:09:46] with
[2:09:47] maybe because the same problems in the
[2:09:49] leadership
[2:09:51] afraid to speak out against things
[2:09:54] there's no shout of the king in the camp
[2:09:58] oh we're on this journey are you
[2:10:01] we must be on
[2:10:02] different roads
[2:10:06] there's to be a shout of the king in the
[2:10:08] camp because there's victory in the camp
[2:10:10] because the enemy can't stand before us
[2:10:11] because we're moving forward to onward
[2:10:13] christian soldier slaying any enemy that
[2:10:15] comes up against us not backing up not
[2:10:18] backing down if it rises up we cut it
[2:10:19] down there is rejoicing there is
[2:10:21] overcoming there is power in the house
[2:10:24] of god because we've moved forward
[2:10:26] underneath the anointing of the holy
[2:10:28] spirit
[2:10:29] we are to be a church on the move a
[2:10:31] church that makes the demons tremble
[2:10:34] listen rahab didn't give that testimony
[2:10:37] to the spies because she heard about how
[2:10:38] nice their camp was
[2:10:41] there is fear in everybody and strength
[2:10:43] left and nobody because y'all's tents
[2:10:45] are awesome
[2:10:48] i mean i've seen how y'all lay in those
[2:10:49] tents
[2:10:50] comfy
[2:10:54] cause we heard how the red sea parted
[2:10:56] how you came across and how you crushed
[2:10:58] this king and crushed that king and you
[2:11:00] moved forward and you came forward and
[2:11:02] the demons know you're getting closer
[2:11:03] and the demons know you're taking more
[2:11:05] ground and you're taking more ground and
[2:11:07] you're possessing this and you're
[2:11:08] possessing that and you're taking this
[2:11:10] and you're taking it back and you're
[2:11:11] cutting this one and you're killing that
[2:11:13] one and you're marching on and on and
[2:11:15] they know you're getting closer and
[2:11:16] closer and closer and they're trembling
[2:11:19] and there's fear and there's no courage
[2:11:21] left and they can't stand before you
[2:11:23] because you're a living church a
[2:11:24] breathing church a powerful church
[2:11:27] moving on underneath the anointing of
[2:11:29] the holy spirit

[2:12:17] holy ghost
[2:12:18] revival what we need today is an old
[2:12:21] time shaking again of the power of god
[2:12:23] a movement of the mulberry mush bushes
[2:12:26] to go forward to battle again
[2:12:29] god's given the moving if people would
[2:12:31] just listen to it
[2:12:33] and believe it

[2:12:39] i hear russell
[2:12:41] i hear russ that's what's been happening
[2:12:43] i hear things going forward
[2:12:45] you look at a different interpretation
[2:12:46] there and actually a movie is the sound
[2:12:49] of marching soldiers in the treetops
[2:12:51] you're encamped about by angels
[2:12:54] and he's gone before you what do you
[2:12:55] have to fear

[2:12:58] waiting to move okay it's time
[2:13:00] he's telling you this morning i've gone
[2:13:01] before you i'm taking care of the enemy
[2:13:04] now it's time for you to move and come
[2:13:05] on
[2:13:06] move with me don't be afraid move
[2:13:09] you hear the russell means he's gone
[2:13:10] before you it's a moving it's one step
[2:13:12] closer
[2:13:13] they moved with moses underneath the
[2:13:15] same message
[2:13:17] not something new
[2:13:19] it's a coming out but it's a going in
[2:13:22] the coming out was great church but i'm
[2:13:24] ready for the going in
[2:13:26] i enjoyed the coming out i enjoyed
[2:13:27] seeing those kingdoms tore down but i'm
[2:13:29] ready for a going in and in order to go
[2:13:32] in you're going to have to move and it's
[2:13:33] in this time it's in this hour under
[2:13:36] this message that we're going to cross
[2:13:38] over and we're going to go in and we're
[2:13:39] going to possess all that was promised
[2:13:41] to us
[2:13:43] it's not something new
[2:13:45] i'm just telling you something's
[2:13:46] happening
[2:13:48] i'm just telling you you don't don't put
[2:13:50] your tent states buried too deep in your
[2:13:52] own conceptions of how things are
[2:13:53] supposed to be
[2:13:54] because there's something happening
[2:13:56] it's time to move well brother aaron
[2:13:58] it's been happening well sure it's been
[2:13:59] happening
[2:14:00] it's the greatest message to ever strike
[2:14:02] the face of the earth and it struck the
[2:14:03] earth a good while ago now it's been
[2:14:05] happening
[2:14:06] the move is on that's thus saith the
[2:14:07] lord that was spoken right here in
[2:14:08] shreveport in 1965 so the move has been
[2:14:11] on since that time
[2:14:13] i'm not trying to tell you this is a new
[2:14:14] move i'm just saying if you can't feel
[2:14:16] the change in the air
[2:14:17] come on now i'm just telling you if you
[2:14:19] can't feel the change in the air if your
[2:14:20] soul isn't just a little bit excited if
[2:14:22] there ain't something telling you that
[2:14:24] it's happening if there ain't something
[2:14:26] telling you there's a shaking going on
[2:14:28] if there ain't something telling you
[2:14:29] that wraps your day is just around the
[2:14:31] corner i don't know what to tell you
[2:14:32] because i feel it in my bones i feel it
[2:14:34] in my soul i realize we're right here i
[2:14:37] realize there's a wrestling he's gone
[2:14:38] before us there's no devil can stop us
[2:14:41] now we're moving now we're walking
[2:14:43] towards that other ram now we're right
[2:14:44] on the virgin any day
[2:14:48] we're going to take that final step
[2:14:51] we're going to cross over
[2:14:52] it's not a new move i'm just telling you
[2:14:54] get ready
[2:14:55] get ready get ready to move you'll be
[2:14:58] ready to move because the move can be
[2:15:00] happening all it wants to and if you
[2:15:01] ain't moving with it it's doing you no
[2:15:03] good
[2:15:08] people are being shook like never before
[2:15:13] people are finding freedom they've never
[2:15:14] had
[2:15:16] miraculous is happening all around us
[2:15:19] brother branham says oh my the time is
[2:15:20] here now to speak i believe the time is
[2:15:22] here for us to speak don't you think so
[2:15:25] i believe the time that the church
[2:15:26] should move up
[2:15:27] or is going back
[2:15:29] i believe the time that the signs of
[2:15:31] mark 16 ought to be following the
[2:15:32] believer don't you believe so
[2:15:34] [Music]
[2:15:35] church the patriarchs longed to see this
[2:15:38] day
[2:15:39] they were excited and they wanted to be
[2:15:41] a part of this moment and you have that
[2:15:42] opportunity and yet brother branham
[2:15:44] looked at it and said the church is
[2:15:45] afraid to move
[2:15:48] he said the church is afraid to move
[2:15:51] he said so wrapped up in tradition
[2:15:53] don't be afraid to make that move church
[2:15:57] if you do you're going to dry up if you
[2:15:59] don't move you're going to drive right
[2:16:00] where you sit
[2:16:02] you got to be willing to move with the
[2:16:03] spirit move with the message move with
[2:16:07] the moving
[2:16:09] move with the moving we got to learn
[2:16:11] from ages going by
[2:16:13] great and powerful moves of god that
[2:16:14] just dried up
[2:16:16] to nothing
[2:16:18] dried up to nothing because they were
[2:16:20] unwilling to move when there was a
[2:16:22] further unveiling or when light shed on
[2:16:24] something that they had not seen before
[2:16:26] even if it had come through the message
[2:16:27] of their hour but because they hadn't
[2:16:29] seen it originally
[2:16:32] when light shines on something move to
[2:16:35] it
[2:16:35] walk in the light that's what you're
[2:16:38] called to do
[2:16:39] some people are so stuck
[2:16:43] forgive me but some people are so stuck
[2:16:45] on god's sent a prophet
[2:16:47] that they have no desire to move from
[2:16:50] that revelation there
[2:16:52] brothers branham said believe that
[2:16:55] plus
[2:16:57] believe that well what's the danger
[2:17:00] again stay in that a good thing that god
[2:17:01] sent a prophet absolutely
[2:17:04] in my study and i came across this and
[2:17:06] it kind of shocked me talking about
[2:17:07] being stuck in place
[2:17:09] that all the way through the end of the
[2:17:11] second century they were still devout
[2:17:13] followers of john the baptist
[2:17:16] that believed
[2:17:18] he was it
[2:17:20] and never were able to even look and see
[2:17:23] what his message had pointed to
[2:17:25] but they walked with john they walked
[2:17:29] with john it was all about john and john
[2:17:32] and john and john and they never would
[2:17:35] accept
[2:17:36] what he actually pointed to that he was
[2:17:38] the forerunner of the coming of jesus
[2:17:41] christ the messiah
[2:17:43] and they walked under this revelation
[2:17:45] that john was a prophet and it was a
[2:17:47] truth
[2:17:48] but they never got any closer to heaven
[2:17:51] walking in that belief
[2:17:53] because there was one he pointed to that
[2:17:55] said i am the truth and i am the life
[2:17:58] he is the way
[2:17:59] but they were stuck on john and they
[2:18:02] were unable to move
[2:18:04] then you got others that that are that
[2:18:05] are stuck in pharaoh worship
[2:18:08] which means sure you can worship but
[2:18:09] only go so far
[2:18:11] only go a little bit they put limits on
[2:18:13] how god moves they limit how you're
[2:18:16] allowed to respond they limit how far
[2:18:18] you're allowed to go and therefore they
[2:18:20] limit their own victory
[2:18:22] and they try to hold people in fear and
[2:18:24] they try to hold people in bondage
[2:18:25] because they're kingdom builders is what
[2:18:27] they are
[2:18:28] they're kingdom builders and they're
[2:18:29] trying to hold people under their self
[2:18:31] and so they point at other ministries
[2:18:32] and they run them down and they point to
[2:18:34] other things and they point to miracles
[2:18:35] and they say this isn't needed and that
[2:18:36] isn't needed and it's all excused
[2:18:38] because it's not happening in their
[2:18:39] church and it's not happening in their
[2:18:40] church because a long time ago the
[2:18:42] pillar of fire moved and they were
[2:18:43] camped down
[2:18:44] and they were unable and unwilling to
[2:18:46] move at the time and so they try to hold
[2:18:48] people by fear and yet i believe that
[2:18:50] true seed of god won't stay there true
[2:18:52] sea of god won't stand for that brother
[2:18:54] brown says
[2:18:55] but the world is beginning to find where
[2:18:57] your secret is what makes that power
[2:19:00] what's these fellows doing they're
[2:19:02] finding and trying to say that the days
[2:19:04] of miracles has passed there's no such
[2:19:06] thing as divine healing now listen close
[2:19:09] and all this here shouting and praising
[2:19:12] the lord and all these signs and wonders
[2:19:14] are not right and it's because they
[2:19:16] don't know god
[2:19:19] they've never been born again
[2:19:22] i'm gonna read that again
[2:19:24] they say there's no such thing as divine
[2:19:25] healing in all this here shouting and
[2:19:28] praising the lord and all these signs
[2:19:29] and wonders are not right
[2:19:31] and it's because they don't know god
[2:19:33] they've never been born again
[2:19:36] god's bible says that he's the same
[2:19:38] yesterday today and forever and his
[2:19:40] power is the same they've come too late
[2:19:42] to tell me about it i've experienced it
[2:19:44] and i know what i'm talking about
[2:19:47] listen man does not orchestrate this
[2:19:49] movement of the holy spirit so therefore
[2:19:51] man will not be able to stop it they may
[2:19:53] can stop it in their little corner they
[2:19:54] might can stomp it out in their little
[2:19:56] church and watch it shrivel up and die
[2:19:58] but what's going to happen is those
[2:19:59] people those true seeds of god they're
[2:20:01] not going to stand for that and they're
[2:20:02] going to go somewhere and find somewhere
[2:20:04] where the holy spirit is moving where
[2:20:05] there's life flowing where there's lives
[2:20:07] changed where they can be delivered
[2:20:09] where they can be set free because
[2:20:10] there's something that longs on the
[2:20:12] inside of them to be with a living god
[2:20:14] in a living presence in a living
[2:20:16] atmosphere it's not orchestrated a man
[2:20:18] and so man cannot stop it
[2:20:21] look i don't want to argue with them if
[2:20:22] that's where they want to operate let
[2:20:24] them operate right there i don't have
[2:20:25] time i'm moving
[2:20:27] i'm moving on brother branham says don
[2:20:29] wells the one that wrote me received the
[2:20:31] holy ghost
[2:20:33] dr rodhead the president
[2:20:35] of the great sudan missions received the
[2:20:36] baptism of the holy ghost in my front
[2:20:38] room see
[2:20:39] now he said brother branham the move is
[2:20:41] on
[2:20:42] so some of them when i said lee they
[2:20:45] thought it was dr lee at memphis so they
[2:20:47] wrote that they wrote there and told
[2:20:49] them oh no certainly dr lee wouldn't
[2:20:51] believe that i said what about it
[2:20:55] i said if he wants to travel in an ox
[2:20:57] cart let him go
[2:20:59] we're on a jet plane let's move on
[2:21:02] we're a different type of baptist let's
[2:21:04] go on the move is on god is moving among
[2:21:08] his people i say if they want to travel
[2:21:10] in a horse and buggy let them alone
[2:21:12] if they want to travel in an ox cart let
[2:21:14] them all but i say today that the move
[2:21:16] is on and there's a people that are no
[2:21:18] longer bound to earth but they're in a
[2:21:20] jet plane they're in the astronaut age
[2:21:22] and they're moving on look the move is
[2:21:24] on that's thus saith the lord and people
[2:21:26] are moving out and they're looking for
[2:21:28] life and they're fine in life because
[2:21:30] the spirit's being poured out in the
[2:21:31] last days upon all flesh and they're
[2:21:33] willing to do whatever it takes to get
[2:21:35] in the atmosphere of life and they're
[2:21:37] moving and they're looking and they're
[2:21:38] searching and they refuse to be held
[2:21:40] down they refuse to be held in bondage
[2:21:42] they refuse to be held there they say i
[2:21:44] gotta move i gotta go i gotta go the
[2:21:46] pillar of fire is moving and i'm going
[2:21:48] with it i'm moving with it i won't be
[2:21:50] caught sitting here
[2:21:55] they're going to places where life is
[2:21:57] because the move is on
[2:21:59] where the holy spirit has preeminence
[2:22:01] where there's worship in spirit
[2:22:03] and in truth
[2:22:05] you say well that's just tommy rot oh
[2:22:08] that is emotion that dancing and
[2:22:10] carry-on is idiotic
[2:22:14] it was actually a quote where brother
[2:22:15] brown agrees with that
[2:22:18] it calls it idiotic i'll read it to you
[2:22:21] and if jesus was considered a holy
[2:22:23] roller himself
[2:22:25] he died on the cross as a heretic
[2:22:28] and the early church was considered a
[2:22:29] bunch of nitwits
[2:22:32] paul told agrippa in the way that's
[2:22:34] called heresy so worship by the god of
[2:22:36] our fathers
[2:22:37] i'm glad tonight to join with and say
[2:22:41] in the way that's called holy rollers
[2:22:43] crazy nonsense idiotic worship i'm going
[2:22:47] to worship
[2:22:48] jesus christ in the power of his
[2:22:50] resurrection by the holy ghost amen in
[2:22:53] the way that's called idiotic count me
[2:22:55] in if that's what you want to call it
[2:22:56] the prophet of god said that's how he
[2:22:58] was going to worship that's how i'm
[2:22:59] going to worship if you don't like it
[2:23:01] you want to call me an idiot that's fine
[2:23:03] i'll be over here with brother brad i'm
[2:23:05] you calling what you want to i'm just
[2:23:06] saying i'm doing what he said do if you
[2:23:09] don't like it you can take it up with
[2:23:10] the prophet because that's not an errand
[2:23:12] quote
[2:23:13] i've got a lot of those but i don't
[2:23:15] bring those over the pulpit
[2:23:19] that's the prophet of god and he said
[2:23:21] that's how
[2:23:22] i'm gonna worship
[2:23:24] i think i'd rather have a little joy
[2:23:27] i think i'd rather have a little
[2:23:28] shouting i think i'd rather have a
[2:23:30] little dancing i think i'd rather have a
[2:23:32] little bit of holy ghost worship and
[2:23:34] take all the criticism in the world than
[2:23:36] sit there in a place that's dried up
[2:23:38] dead more than just sitting there don't
[2:23:40] move like a bunch of bumps on a pickle
[2:23:42] sitting there just staring at the pulpit
[2:23:43] don't know what's going on ain't moved
[2:23:45] in years and years and years and years
[2:23:46] and you're dead
[2:23:48] that's fine call me an idiot i'd rather
[2:23:50] have a little emotion i'd rather have a
[2:23:52] little running around the church a
[2:23:53] little shouting a little praising
[2:23:54] because i've seen the fruits of it you
[2:23:56] say it's emotion i say i've seen the
[2:23:58] sick healed you say it's emotion i say
[2:24:00] i've seen people feel with the holy
[2:24:01] ghost you say it's emotion i say i've
[2:24:03] seen people save i've seen lives changed
[2:24:06] i've seen people completely their lives
[2:24:08] revolutionized and changed in a moment
[2:24:11] if you want to call it emotion i'll take
[2:24:13] that kind of emotion it makes me
[2:24:16] emotional thank you jesus when you move
[2:24:19] thank you for saving thank you for
[2:24:20] calling
[2:24:21] we're a church that's willing and able
[2:24:24] to move
[2:24:38] the pillar of fire moves on
[2:24:41] it's a quote
[2:24:42] the pillar of fire moves on and god
[2:24:44] moves with it and somebody sees it
[2:24:47] and goes on
[2:24:52] i skipped a lot
[2:24:53] so bear with me here hopefully i can
[2:24:55] bring this right back in
[2:24:58] see there are movements
[2:25:00] against the movement
[2:25:04] movements against the moving of the
[2:25:05] spirit
[2:25:07] the brown says they got people to obey
[2:25:09] them until the time came that their way
[2:25:11] of worship did not in any way at all
[2:25:13] resemble the early days of pentecost
[2:25:16] and that's why we hammer against it so
[2:25:18] much
[2:25:19] he says that the bride of the last day
[2:25:21] is going to move
[2:25:23] and will return to the power of
[2:25:24] pentecost to welcome back the lord jesus
[2:25:26] christ
[2:25:28] but see that spirit of denomination will
[2:25:29] work itself in and bring formalism
[2:25:33] and try to formalize the worship
[2:25:34] denomination is not a headquarters
[2:25:36] somewhere
[2:25:38] all right denomination doesn't mean you
[2:25:40] have soup suppers on tuesday and you go
[2:25:42] feed the old people on thursday and you
[2:25:45] do this and and then you report to
[2:25:48] headquarters and
[2:25:50] the nomination is a spirit
[2:25:54] that binds the moving of the holy spirit
[2:25:59] it drives tent stakes down really deep
[2:26:02] it puts everything in a box
[2:26:05] it puts a period at the end of
[2:26:06] experiences
[2:26:09] and hating programs
[2:26:11] becomes your program
[2:26:13] bless god we're not a denomination
[2:26:16] are you not
[2:26:18] that becomes all you stand for
[2:26:21] when it gets to the point that all you
[2:26:23] stand for is standing against things
[2:26:25] then you're not standing for anything
[2:26:29] don't tell me look if you have something
[2:26:31] so amazing
[2:26:35] then point to it
[2:26:40] tell me what you have
[2:26:42] show me the life
[2:26:45] that's exactly right preach the gospel
[2:26:49] when hating everything becomes your
[2:26:51] gospel you have no gospel to give
[2:26:55] and that's the spirit of denomination
[2:26:58] to where your services become so
[2:27:00] ritualistic that it's like a catholic
[2:27:02] mass
[2:27:05] oh not so brother aaron
[2:27:07] is it not predictable
[2:27:10] we're going to sing this many songs
[2:27:12] we're always going to invite the
[2:27:13] preacher out on this song he's going to
[2:27:15] preach about 45 minutes we're gonna have
[2:27:17] two songs at the end we're gonna dismiss
[2:27:21] when's the last time that the spirit had
[2:27:23] such control of the service that you
[2:27:25] were shocked at how it went
[2:27:30] i can't believe that happened
[2:27:33] and i don't mean the preacher went five
[2:27:34] minutes too long
[2:27:38] but the lord moved in a way that blew
[2:27:40] your mind because it wasn't put in a box
[2:27:45] that is the spirit of denominationalism
[2:27:48] brother branham says
[2:27:50] that's the commission of the church
[2:27:51] today lay aside every weight and the sin
[2:27:53] that does so easily beset us that we
[2:27:55] might run
[2:27:56] the race with patience that is set
[2:27:58] before us hebrews 12 said seeing we're
[2:28:00] compassed about with such a great crowd
[2:28:02] crowd of witnesses
[2:28:03] how the miracles was done by faith said
[2:28:06] let us lay aside every weight and the
[2:28:07] sin that so easily beset us we're
[2:28:09] stopping too much for little social
[2:28:11] things we're stopping too much and
[2:28:13] tolerate with the world we're stopping
[2:28:15] too much to see if we don't get a little
[2:28:17] bit too fanatical
[2:28:19] i'm scared more i'm more afraid of a
[2:28:22] person that's afraid
[2:28:25] then i am the person that's a fanatic
[2:28:28] that's right i'd rather have a little
[2:28:30] wildfire than have no fire at all sure i
[2:28:32] would i'd rather be around a fire that's
[2:28:35] popping and jumping anytime if the
[2:28:37] world's cold than to be around an
[2:28:39] iceberg certainly don't paint a fire you
[2:28:42] can't get warm by a painted fire you got
[2:28:44] to have some real
[2:28:46] fire
[2:28:48] church i'm more afraid of people that
[2:28:50] are afraid of being fanatical
[2:28:53] than i am of the fanatical
[2:28:56] because someone who's afraid of the
[2:28:57] fanatical will never be able to move
[2:28:59] even when it is
[2:29:02] the real thing
[2:29:03] the real spirit of god moves and they're
[2:29:05] sitting there going i don't want to be a
[2:29:06] fanatic
[2:29:09] is it not okay to be a fanatic for jesus
[2:29:13] is it not okay
[2:29:15] we got to be a church on the move
[2:29:16] evening light tabernacle
[2:29:18] marching to the orders of the word sold
[2:29:21] out separated moving from glory to glory
[2:29:24] from victory to victory following the
[2:29:27] leading of the pillar of fire
[2:29:31] i believe that this church moves
[2:29:34] i believe that you are a living
[2:29:36] testimony
[2:29:37] that the message of malachi 4 works
[2:29:41] i believe that you are a testimony of
[2:29:43] hebrews 13 and 8.
[2:29:45] i believe you're a testimony of john 14
[2:29:48] 12.
[2:29:49] believe you're a testimony that by his
[2:29:51] stripes
[2:29:52] we are healed
[2:29:57] you hear the critic
[2:29:59] critics say what about
[2:30:01] when you pray and pray and pray and it
[2:30:03] doesn't work
[2:30:05] and you lose someone like this church
[2:30:07] lost sister karen
[2:30:12] see that's not how i see it
[2:30:17] brain bleeds brother joe
[2:30:19] had tried time after time
[2:30:22] and failed
[2:30:25] because by his stripes
[2:30:26] i'm healed
[2:30:29] they came and attacked our sister karen
[2:30:32] and couldn't take her
[2:30:34] so that brain bleed you know what it
[2:30:35] tried to do it tried to take her sight
[2:30:37] and cause blindness
[2:30:39] couldn't even take her sight
[2:30:40] as a matter of fact in the midst of its
[2:30:42] attack trying to take her sight not only
[2:30:43] does she receive a healing and a
[2:30:45] deliverance but a little boy got up and
[2:30:46] walked and ran been walking and running
[2:30:48] just fine ever since he's fast just
[2:30:50] asking
[2:30:54] he says cheetah
[2:30:58] brain bleeds brought an attack against
[2:31:00] our sister karen and out of it we got a
[2:31:02] testimony because by his stripes we are
[2:31:04] healed because hebrews 13 8 were a
[2:31:06] living testimony of it
[2:31:08] they couldn't even take her sight it
[2:31:10] couldn't even take her joy so it comes
[2:31:12] back again in a bigger batter more
[2:31:14] menacing attack and it comes in and it
[2:31:16] hits her and it causes a midline shift
[2:31:18] and it says this time i got her she's
[2:31:20] only got five minutes to live and even
[2:31:22] if she lives past that she'll be a
[2:31:24] vegetable wrong again devil
[2:31:27] once again hebrews 13 8 once again by
[2:31:30] his stripes i'm healed he raises her
[2:31:31] right up from that she makes a complete
[2:31:32] recovery she travels the world she
[2:31:35] testifies of god's healing and his
[2:31:36] mercies she runs around this church as a
[2:31:38] testimony that by his stripes i am
[2:31:41] healed she testifies by a life lived
[2:31:44] with her shoulders back and head up let
[2:31:46] me remind the devil that he failed i
[2:31:50] would like to tell him that his brain
[2:31:51] bleeds failed all that happened was
[2:31:54] sister karen was used by the lord jesus
[2:31:56] to remind us once again that divine
[2:31:58] healing is real that divine healing is
[2:32:01] the truth and that is the earnest of a
[2:32:03] new body sister karen testifies to you
[2:32:06] there is a resurrection there is a new
[2:32:08] body there is life
[2:32:10] satan you failed out of everything you
[2:32:13] did there is a church that saw divine
[2:32:16] healing and the reality of it and then
[2:32:18] it was a testimony there is a
[2:32:20] resurrection
[2:32:21] it was the earnest that i have a new
[2:32:24] body waiting for me
[2:32:28] and she did her job you said and brain
[2:32:30] bleeds took her nope brain bleeds didn't
[2:32:33] take her the lord jesus said you've done
[2:32:34] your job sister karen come
[2:32:36] on well done my good and faithful
[2:32:39] servant you ran a good race
[2:32:42] she testified a living testimony by his
[2:32:46] stripes
[2:32:48] i am healed
[2:32:53] and although we're always going to
[2:32:55] remember her
[2:32:56] and we will always honor a life
[2:32:59] a remarkable life
[2:33:01] live for the lord jesus you will not
[2:33:03] find this family nor will you find this
[2:33:06] church camp down in mourning
[2:33:08] we're moving
[2:33:10] you're not going to find us camp down
[2:33:11] here camp down in sadness camp down and
[2:33:13] woe is me we're going to keep right on
[2:33:15] moving proclaiming god's a healer god's
[2:33:17] a savior he fills with the holy ghost he
[2:33:20] heals in every situation we're going to
[2:33:21] keep preaching this glorious gospel of
[2:33:23] the lord jesus because it's the truth
[2:33:25] and because it works and in sister
[2:33:27] karen's life it proves that it works
[2:33:30] so we're not going to camp down there
[2:33:32] we're going to move on because she won
[2:33:34] church she won
[2:33:36] we're all gonna win you can't fail if
[2:33:38] you're moving on if you're following the
[2:33:39] pillar of fire you win that's how this
[2:33:42] thing works brother brown said we
[2:33:43] believe that through divine healings we
[2:33:46] have the earnest of our redeemed bodies
[2:33:49] and if there is no divine healing now
[2:33:50] there is no resurrection of the body
[2:33:52] divine healing is the earnest of our
[2:33:54] redeemed body did you ever think of that
[2:33:56] if there's no divine healing then when
[2:33:58] we go to the grave that's all of it
[2:34:00] you'll be there forever and your dust
[2:34:01] will go away and there'll be no more of
[2:34:03] you see
[2:34:04] but look at the day we're living in
[2:34:06] what's promised for this day where are
[2:34:08] we we've moved on up
[2:34:10] the pillar of fire moves and the
[2:34:11] children of israel moved with the pillar
[2:34:13] of fire
[2:34:14] or they went back to egypt
[2:34:18] oh moses this is a good spot let's camp
[2:34:20] right here
[2:34:22] the lord just opened the red sea
[2:34:24] this is where the power of god is let's
[2:34:26] camp right here let's stay right here
[2:34:29] god's moving right here surely god is
[2:34:31] here
[2:34:32] moses god just rained down manna for the
[2:34:34] first time ever do you realize that
[2:34:36] baked bread just don't fall out of the
[2:34:37] sky
[2:34:40] what's wrong with you moses is a big
[2:34:41] deal we should stay here
[2:34:45] but the pillar of fire moved
[2:34:47] and he moved on
[2:34:49] moses why do we have to move
[2:34:52] why do we have to move moses because it
[2:34:53] was more than signs and wonders
[2:34:56] because it was about more than the red
[2:34:58] sea opening it was about more than
[2:34:59] leaving egypt it was more than man it
[2:35:02] was more than water in the rock it was
[2:35:04] more than all that it was about a bride
[2:35:06] marching to a new home
[2:35:08] we can't stay here it's about more than
[2:35:11] all of this it's about going home it's
[2:35:14] about leaving it's not just about
[2:35:16] staying those things are just allowed to
[2:35:18] give you the strength to take another
[2:35:20] step move another day fight through
[2:35:22] another obstacle overcome another enemy
[2:35:24] it's about a bride on the earth onward
[2:35:27] christian soldier bone of his bone
[2:35:29] fighting moving moving moving moving
[2:35:33] we can't stay here because it wasn't
[2:35:35] just about coming out
[2:35:38] it's about going in
[2:35:45] i'm gonna start bringing this down i
[2:35:46] know i've been a while
[2:35:49] and we may
[2:35:52] i just felt led to go this way
[2:35:54] it may take a little bit of a turn
[2:36:02] now is the time for these things
[2:36:06] then why would we not want these things
[2:36:08] in our services
[2:36:10] and not just in our services
[2:36:14] in our lives
[2:36:20] the moving of the spirit is not
[2:36:22] just for church services
[2:36:26] the point of great church services isn't
[2:36:28] to have great church services
[2:36:31] that's not what it's about
[2:36:34] oh the spirit moved why whoo so we could
[2:36:36] have fun in church so we could run and
[2:36:37] shout and
[2:36:40] now the point of great church services
[2:36:42] isn't to have great church services
[2:36:44] it's those people's lives can be changed
[2:36:46] and it can carry on beyond the church
[2:36:49] service it's so people can encounter a
[2:36:51] living god
[2:36:52] is to allow the spirit to have free
[2:36:54] reigns so that births can take place
[2:36:57] so that the holy s in that holy spirit
[2:36:59] atmosphere people can receive a new
[2:37:00] birth and from there people can move
[2:37:02] above sin from there people can live
[2:37:05] above temptation i'm not too much
[2:37:06] worried about how you live sunday and
[2:37:08] wednesday although you better live good
[2:37:09] those two days too but what about the
[2:37:11] other five days of the week
[2:37:13] is the spirit moving in your home and in
[2:37:15] your life the other five days of the
[2:37:17] week
[2:37:18] are you able to move out above and claim
[2:37:21] your promises in church you here claim
[2:37:22] your promise claim your promise you're
[2:37:23] like yeah yeah yeah claim a promise on
[2:37:25] monday you're like
[2:37:28] so far
[2:37:30] so much
[2:37:31] it's just easier to stay camped right
[2:37:32] here
[2:37:33] the good camp
[2:37:40] i long for the spirit to move in our
[2:37:42] services
[2:37:44] i love it when he moves down amongst us
[2:37:46] and there's believers and there's
[2:37:47] rejoicing and they're shouting in the
[2:37:49] shout of the king and praise and worship
[2:37:52] but i want it to be more than that
[2:37:54] i want it for you to be more than a
[2:37:56] church jump i want for you to be more
[2:37:58] than a church shout i want it for you to
[2:38:00] be more than a church dance but i want
[2:38:03] you to allow him to move every single
[2:38:05] day in your life
[2:38:07] and allow the spirit to begin to move
[2:38:09] you higher
[2:38:11] not move by run shout dance jump
[2:38:13] wonderful i love those things but is it
[2:38:16] moving you closer to that land
[2:38:18] are you moving closer in a relationship
[2:38:20] with god is it moving you into a deeper
[2:38:23] and more sincere
[2:38:25] relationship
[2:38:27] if the prophet of god was told he needed
[2:38:28] to be more sincere
[2:38:31] then what does that say about you and i
[2:38:36] the one that we hold in
[2:38:38] high respect high regard
[2:38:40] you have to be more sincere
[2:38:42] lord help me
[2:38:45] lord help me
[2:38:48] get you to the point to where you begin
[2:38:50] to live your life in an atmosphere not
[2:38:53] just church services you live your life
[2:38:55] in an atmosphere where all things are
[2:38:58] possible
[2:38:59] are all things possible in the
[2:39:00] atmosphere you live in on tuesday at 9
[2:39:03] 30.
[2:39:04] that's tough ain't it
[2:39:07] i know buddy
[2:39:09] i'm surrounded by a thousand heathens at
[2:39:10] 9 30 on tuesdays
[2:39:13] bless their hearts
[2:39:16] it's hard to walk in that atmosphere
[2:39:19] but we're not supposed to leave the holy
[2:39:20] ghost in that atmosphere right here
[2:39:23] what kind of atmosphere men do you bring
[2:39:25] to your home from work
[2:39:30] what are we producing
[2:39:32] when we talk about we want to see the
[2:39:34] spirit move in church

[2:39:56] a real sincere
[2:39:58] get back to god holy ghost move
[2:40:01] where we die out to our ideas we die out
[2:40:03] to our thinking we die out to our
[2:40:05] worldly pleasures and the things that we
[2:40:06] think are okay and this and that when we
[2:40:08] die out and say god i need a move in my
[2:40:10] life
[2:40:12] we need to move in the lives of the
[2:40:13] people of evening light tabernacle we
[2:40:15] need to move to consecration
[2:40:18] we need to move to dedication to where
[2:40:20] we can at least get people to show up
[2:40:22] for the services we have i mean we only
[2:40:24] have two a week
[2:40:29] can we get dedicated enough to be in the
[2:40:31] house of god on a regular basis
[2:40:35] don't tell me that your prayer life is
[2:40:37] where it's supposed to be don't tell me
[2:40:39] that your family alters where it's
[2:40:40] supposed to be on those nights of the
[2:40:42] week and you can't show up on wednesday
[2:40:45] because you didn't stay home because you
[2:40:46] was having family prayer
[2:40:52] there's got to be a move to dedication
[2:40:54] and a move to sincerity
[2:40:56] yes we want to move yes we want to move
[2:40:57] yes we want to move but where is it
[2:40:59] taking us to
[2:41:01] what's it doing for us
[2:41:02] church is time to move
[2:41:05] the lord is already moving
[2:41:08] oh my how the lord loves to move and see
[2:41:10] his people move with him
[2:41:12] see his people take up the tent stakes
[2:41:13] and say lord i'll go
[2:41:15] lord i'll move where you're moving
[2:41:18] it's time to move and you're not going
[2:41:19] to get to that promised land going
[2:41:21] around the same mountain you've been
[2:41:22] going around over and over and over
[2:41:25] again
[2:41:26] i don't just want to see you move in
[2:41:28] church i want you to put it in action
[2:41:31] i want you moving on monday i want to
[2:41:32] see you moving on tuesday wednesday
[2:41:34] thursday friday i want to see you moving
[2:41:36] each and every day
[2:41:37] growing and progressing
[2:41:40] getting what you asked for going on the
[2:41:42] offensive for too long it's been all
[2:41:44] about i'll protect my home that's fine
[2:41:46] you should but we're not to be a people
[2:41:48] that's just great at defending what we
[2:41:50] have we are to be gaining ground
[2:41:52] taking it from the enemy taking the
[2:41:54] attack to the enemy
[2:41:56] i love how it was brought out the other
[2:41:57] day that the gates of hell will not
[2:41:59] withstand that means that the gates of
[2:42:01] hell were under attack
[2:42:03] because they couldn't withstand it it's
[2:42:04] time to go on the offensive church it's
[2:42:06] time to move out from your comfort zone
[2:42:08] and move out against the enemy
[2:42:15] let's get personal
[2:42:17] let's buckle up for a moment
[2:42:20] how about you
[2:42:23] you
[2:42:24] when's the last time
[2:42:26] you progressed
[2:42:28] i didn't say when's the last time you
[2:42:29] held your testimony
[2:42:32] i didn't say have you fallen
[2:42:35] i said when's the last time you
[2:42:36] progressed till you can honestly look
[2:42:38] back and go man i've come a long way
[2:42:43] when's the last time you progressed and
[2:42:46] you
[2:42:47] moved
[2:42:48] not backwards not on your own
[2:42:51] but following the pillar of fire is
[2:42:54] there a marked difference in where you
[2:42:55] are today versus where you were a year
[2:42:57] ago
[2:42:59] are you more dedicated
[2:43:01] are you more sincere
[2:43:06] because there's got to be a pressing
[2:43:08] forward i press towards the mark
[2:43:12] not i got this testimony and i'm
[2:43:13] standing here bless god and heaven's
[2:43:15] going to come to me one day
[2:43:16] now you're pressing
[2:43:18] you're pushing
[2:43:20] not just occupying
[2:43:23] not just staying still but gaining new
[2:43:25] ground
[2:43:26] have you advanced
[2:43:30] have you taken another step
[2:43:32] like we said not to a new message not to
[2:43:34] a new doctrine not to a new gospel
[2:43:36] this is the gospel paul preached
[2:43:40] they shouted back to brother branham
[2:43:41] we're resting on that
[2:43:43] this is the gospel paul priest i'm not
[2:43:44] telling you to move out from another i'm
[2:43:45] telling you to move in it
[2:43:47] move under it feed on it let it take you
[2:43:50] where it's supposed to be taking you
[2:43:53] brother joe told us wednesday night this
[2:43:55] is not a picnic this is war
[2:43:57] you don't win wars sitting still
[2:44:00] and you don't win wars camp down
[2:44:02] you win wars advancing
[2:44:06] have you gathered a fresh experience
[2:44:08] today or does your experience have
[2:44:10] wiggletails in it
[2:44:14] have you been gathering fresh mana
[2:44:18] i want us just for a minute to move away
[2:44:19] from the group mentality
[2:44:24] and please don't think i'm in any way
[2:44:25] trying to beat anybody over the head
[2:44:26] this just came to me so strong this week
[2:44:28] i said lord just help me deliver this
[2:44:30] in a manner of love is we got to be
[2:44:32] moving
[2:44:35] and it probably spoke to me more than
[2:44:36] it'll ever speak to you
[2:44:39] i got to move
[2:44:41] i have to move
[2:44:44] but let's get away from the group
[2:44:45] mentality because a lot of times what we
[2:44:47] what we like to do
[2:44:54] is we see that the group is moving
[2:44:55] forward
[2:44:57] we see that the bride is progressing
[2:45:00] and many times we take comfort in the
[2:45:02] success of the group
[2:45:04] and so we deflect our own shortcomings
[2:45:06] by focusing on the success of what we've
[2:45:08] affiliated ourselves with
[2:45:11] kind of like the guy celebrating the
[2:45:13] super bowl championship and he was on
[2:45:15] the practice squad
[2:45:17] really he didn't do anything
[2:45:20] just to make a point
[2:45:21] we sit there and go man the bride is
[2:45:23] moving forward
[2:45:25] the bride is overcoming
[2:45:27] our church is on fire evening like
[2:45:29] tabernacle is on fire the services are
[2:45:32] incredible the sick are healed people
[2:45:34] are being filled with the spirit we've
[2:45:35] had baptisms the spirit is moving in our
[2:45:38] church
[2:45:38] and i say is the spirit moving in you
[2:45:44] right now this isn't about evening like
[2:45:45] tabernacle this isn't about the bride
[2:45:47] world why this about you as an
[2:45:49] individual
[2:45:53] has the spirit been moving in you and
[2:45:55] have you been moving with the spirit
[2:45:58] brother aaron you're talking to the
[2:45:59] sinners you talking to the backsliders
[2:46:03] talking to every one of us
[2:46:07] because we all have to be going forward
[2:46:10] i wonder how long some of us have been
[2:46:11] camped out exactly where we're camped
[2:46:13] out this morning
[2:46:14] where you're currently at how long have
[2:46:16] we been there
[2:46:18] you know many people recognize they need
[2:46:20] to move and sometimes we're afraid to
[2:46:21] move
[2:46:24] because we feel safe where we're at we
[2:46:25] feel comfortable where we're at
[2:46:27] we feel comfortable with what we've done
[2:46:29] we've conformed i dress right
[2:46:31] i don't curse
[2:46:33] i talk right i don't tell dirty jokes i
[2:46:34] listen to tapes i come to church i
[2:46:37] believe the message
[2:46:38] good steps
[2:46:42] believe this
[2:46:43] plus
[2:46:46] can you add to that today
[2:46:48] can you take another step today i've
[2:46:50] been filled with the spirit and i've
[2:46:51] walked with god for many years
[2:46:53] how's that fire burning today
[2:46:56] how was that hunger when you woke up
[2:46:58] this morning
[2:46:59] how's it going to be in the morning
[2:47:03] that spot that you're currently in may
[2:47:05] be a spot
[2:47:06] that god led you to
[2:47:09] i'm not saying you're in an ungodly
[2:47:11] place
[2:47:12] there were many places that the pillar
[2:47:14] of fire led the people to and stopped
[2:47:18] and they camped
[2:47:19] the place you're in may be a place that
[2:47:21] god has led you to he brought you
[2:47:23] exactly to where you're at
[2:47:26] he stopped
[2:47:28] and it was a place where you were
[2:47:29] supposed to be
[2:47:32] you stopped obediently
[2:47:34] but i asked you where's the pillar of
[2:47:35] fire at today
[2:47:39] did it move on
[2:47:42] did you stay camped
[2:47:45] did it move on at some point and you
[2:47:47] remain behind look maybe you danced on
[2:47:49] the banks of the red sea
[2:47:52] what a wonderful wonderful thing
[2:47:55] i believe we literally almost witnessed
[2:47:57] a reenactment of that that time when
[2:47:59] sister ruth took that tambourine at the
[2:48:00] end of that service during our meetings
[2:48:04] in my mind i could see the the sisters
[2:48:06] dancing on the banks of the red sea was
[2:48:08] incredible
[2:48:09] it was incredible to see even here i can
[2:48:11] only imagine what was like there maybe
[2:48:12] you danced there maybe you saw your
[2:48:14] taskmasters dead
[2:48:16] maybe you were prayed for and demons
[2:48:18] fell off and you shouted and you jumped
[2:48:20] maybe it happened in your seat at the
[2:48:21] altar and you saw him drown you were set
[2:48:24] free
[2:48:25] and today you find yourself still
[2:48:27] standing on the banks of the red sea
[2:48:29] you haven't progressed
[2:48:31] from that point
[2:48:36] maybe at first you fell in love with the
[2:48:37] message it was manna
[2:48:40] you love to gather it you love to eat it
[2:48:42] and now it's tough for you to even get
[2:48:43] through a tape
[2:48:46] look i'm glad you came out
[2:48:48] i'm glad you accepted this truth i'm
[2:48:51] glad you accepted this message whether
[2:48:52] it was in 1983 1991
[2:48:55] 1976-2006 i'm glad it cleaned you up i'm
[2:48:57] glad you're here
[2:48:58] we're on this journey together but i'm
[2:49:00] asking are you moving
[2:49:03] have you moved lately
[2:49:04] have you taken steps
[2:49:06] look i'm sincerely glad
[2:49:08] i'm not knocking you i'm proud of what
[2:49:10] you've done i'm proud of how far you've
[2:49:12] come and i'm saying it's time to take
[2:49:13] another step
[2:49:15] i'm just telling you to move today
[2:49:16] that's all i'm saying when's the last
[2:49:18] time you purposely said god i'm taking
[2:49:20] another step i'm devin deeper than ever
[2:49:23] before i'm being more sincere than ever
[2:49:25] before i'm dedicating myself more than
[2:49:27] ever before
[2:49:28] it's time to move it's time to walk it's
[2:49:30] time to grow it's time to seek it's time
[2:49:32] to move
[2:49:34] look this isn't a motivational speech
[2:49:36] i'm sorry but i'm here to tell you you
[2:49:38] can do it
[2:49:40] you can do it
[2:49:42] just step out beyond that fear and step
[2:49:44] out beyond that thing when's the last
[2:49:45] time you came to an altar brother aaron
[2:49:47] i've been in the message 30 years so
[2:49:51] the altar isn't just a place for sinners
[2:49:53] that's a place you just need to go have
[2:49:54] a talk with the lord
[2:49:56] say lord i'm here today help me take
[2:49:57] another step
[2:49:59] lord i'm just trying to walk a little
[2:50:00] further with you
[2:50:01] it's time that you take a step move out
[2:50:04] move out from those personal things
[2:50:05] holding you back how long have you been
[2:50:06] camped down with a complex
[2:50:09] sitting there and that's as far as
[2:50:10] you'll go because that complex hold you
[2:50:13] how long you been sitting there with
[2:50:14] those with those family things that held
[2:50:16] you down with that bitterness in your
[2:50:18] heart
[2:50:21] you can walk away from that critical
[2:50:23] spirit right now
[2:50:25] critical spirits go hand in hand with
[2:50:27] people who refuse to move
[2:50:29] they got time to see everything and
[2:50:31] everybody because they ain't got to
[2:50:32] watch the road they ain't going nowhere
[2:50:36] and so they look at everybody else
[2:50:39] and they find
[2:50:41] faults with every church member
[2:50:43] with the leadership of the church with
[2:50:45] the deacons with the ministry
[2:50:47] with the piano player and the organ
[2:50:49] player and this player
[2:50:54] why
[2:50:56] if you've sold out and you're worshiping
[2:50:58] it's kind of hard to notice all that
[2:50:59] stuff
[2:51:02] if you're focusing on overcoming it's
[2:51:03] kind of hard to notice where other
[2:51:05] people are falling
[2:51:08] quit picking everything apart
[2:51:10] and move
[2:51:12] i don't mean just come to church
[2:51:14] i mean are you fellowshipping with god
[2:51:17] would jesus have been comfortable
[2:51:19] walking around in your skin for the last
[2:51:21] month
[2:51:33] have a hard time answering that one
[2:51:36] would jesus have been comfortable
[2:51:38] walking around in your skin for the last
[2:51:39] month
[2:51:43] brother brown says don't try to say well
[2:51:44] i joined the church 10 years ago brother
[2:51:46] branham i've been a good faithful member
[2:51:48] that's fine i appreciate that
[2:51:50] but let's move on tonight
[2:51:52] god's moving on
[2:51:54] he said let's move on god's moving on
[2:51:57] you can't go in church if you don't move
[2:52:00] you got to take that next step greater
[2:52:02] sincerity more of god seek
[2:52:06] you once moved you're here because you
[2:52:08] once moved
[2:52:10] it's time
[2:52:12] to move again
[2:52:14] how long are you going to stay where
[2:52:15] you're at lukewarm bitter hurt
[2:52:18] don't sit still
[2:52:19] i'm asking you to move today
[2:52:23] don't be a sitting duck allowing things
[2:52:25] to encircle and circle you and take you
[2:52:27] down
[2:52:28] it's time for your deliverance today
[2:52:31] deliverance from what
[2:52:33] deliverance from the fact that you
[2:52:34] hadn't moved in five years deliverance
[2:52:36] from a lukewarm condition deliverance
[2:52:38] from all the things holding you in that
[2:52:40] place
[2:52:42] it's time for your salvation today look
[2:52:44] some of you have never made a move
[2:52:48] some of you have never taken the first
[2:52:49] step
[2:52:50] today's the day to move
[2:52:52] today is the day of salvation
[2:52:54] it's time you make a move towards god
[2:52:56] and you watch him move and respond
[2:52:58] back to you he'll do it brother joe
[2:53:00] every time
[2:53:02] you got to move
[2:53:04] you got to wake up and take a step
[2:53:05] brother aaron why the urgency why do we
[2:53:07] got to move today because it won't be
[2:53:09] long and you'll wish you could have this
[2:53:10] opportunity again
[2:53:12] it won't be long and you'll say lord i
[2:53:13] wish i could have just got a little
[2:53:15] closer
[2:53:16] do you want to meet jesus the way you
[2:53:18] are right this second i'm not saying or
[2:53:20] are you saved i believe you're saved
[2:53:23] i'm saying you have the opportunity to
[2:53:25] take another step with him today if
[2:53:27] you're not saved i'm saying salvation is
[2:53:29] here for you today but you got a part to
[2:53:31] play just like abram you got to move
[2:53:34] today
[2:53:35] the opportunity is here jesus is calling
[2:53:38] you he's wound you and he's saying you
[2:53:39] got to move today church
[2:53:41] every one of us have to move today
[2:53:44] what if you're a borderline believer
[2:53:47] move
[2:53:49] what if you're the saintliest christian
[2:53:51] here today
[2:53:52] move
[2:53:54] brother brown said there was borderline
[2:53:56] believers that used to attend the
[2:53:57] meetings of noah in other words they
[2:53:59] went to church
[2:54:01] just like there is now and people sit
[2:54:03] around all the time in the church but
[2:54:04] they never make a move to come forward
[2:54:07] they enjoy hearing the pastor preach and
[2:54:09] something another but they never make a
[2:54:10] move forward
[2:54:12] so then the first thing they never want
[2:54:13] you
[2:54:14] want to put their hands in it
[2:54:16] and they don't want to be identified
[2:54:18] with it
[2:54:19] i asked you this morning if you're a
[2:54:21] sinner or a backslider in the building
[2:54:24] listen to brother branham
[2:54:27] you'll either go out of the door a
[2:54:28] better man or woman than what you come
[2:54:30] in
[2:54:31] or you'll go out worse than you was when
[2:54:32] you come in you can't stay mediocre
[2:54:36] you've got to make it
[2:54:38] this was on my heart
[2:54:40] it was on my heart now it's on your
[2:54:42] hands
[2:54:43] you've got to make your decision you've
[2:54:44] got to make a decision
[2:54:48] you got to make a decision you've been
[2:54:51] maybe a good church member maybe you've
[2:54:53] always longed that you wanted more of
[2:54:54] god you might wanted to do something for
[2:54:57] god remember you're only mortal once and
[2:55:00] that one time is the only time you're
[2:55:02] going to be mortal this may be the time
[2:55:04] that you've got to make your decision
[2:55:06] you're either going to move up with god
[2:55:07] or stay where you're at you may have to
[2:55:09] make your decision tonight if it is i
[2:55:11] pray that you'll throw everything loose
[2:55:14] remember i don't care what it is if it's
[2:55:16] a job if it's family if it's loved ones
[2:55:18] if it's associates if it's your partners
[2:55:20] whatever it is
[2:55:21] turn loose of everything today
[2:55:23] won't you move
[2:55:26] the holy spirit's asking you today won't
[2:55:27] you
[2:55:28] move one word of god misplaced or
[2:55:31] misconstrued or it's not accepted breaks
[2:55:33] the whole chain
[2:55:34] man should not live by bread alone by
[2:55:36] every word that proceedeth out of the
[2:55:37] mouth of god
[2:55:38] why is it women you hear me preach
[2:55:40] against these things wearing shorts and
[2:55:42] paints and hairdos of this bobbed hair
[2:55:45] and all that kind of stuff and then
[2:55:46] every year i come back and you're still
[2:55:48] sitting in the same condition
[2:55:50] it's because you're leaning to your own
[2:55:52] understanding instead of the word of god
[2:55:57] but won't you move today
[2:56:04] what did he do
[2:56:05] he's talking about
[2:56:09] the prodigal
[2:56:11] he done something about it oh brother
[2:56:13] sister do you see what i mean he didn't
[2:56:15] just sit there and say
[2:56:17] god said so he done something about it
[2:56:19] if you want to get saved this morning
[2:56:21] god promised salvation
[2:56:24] then do something about it don't just
[2:56:26] sit there
[2:56:28] it's time for you to move
[2:56:31] whatever situation you find yourself in
[2:56:33] today what i want you to take from this
[2:56:35] is it's time for you to move and you
[2:56:36] have an opportunity right now in this
[2:56:38] moment to take another step with god
[2:56:40] it's time for you to quit living below
