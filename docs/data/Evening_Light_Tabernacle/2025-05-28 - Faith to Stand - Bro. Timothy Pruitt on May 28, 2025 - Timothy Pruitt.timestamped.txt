[5:22] [Music]
[7:26] [Music]
[8:32] Heat. Heat.
[8:34] [Music]
[9:16] Just
[9:18] suppose God
[9:20] serves throughout heaven.
[9:26] and couldn't
[9:29] find one
[9:31] willing to
[9:34] [Music]
[9:36] be the
[9:39] brave sacrifice that was needed.
[9:48] that would
[9:49] buy eternal life for you and me.
[9:58] and had it got
[10:00] there for a
[10:02] place called Mount Calary.
[10:08] and had it not
[10:10] been for an old
[10:13] rug
[10:17] cross. Oh, had
[10:20] enough for a man. Oh, called
[10:27] Jesus. Then
[10:31] forever my soul would be. Sing it again.
[10:36] had it
[10:37] nothing. Oh, and had it not
[10:41] been for a place called Mount
[10:48] Calary. And had it not
[10:51] been for the
[10:54] old cross.
[10:59] had
[11:01] enough for a
[11:04] man called
[11:08] Jesus. Oh,
[11:11] forever my soul will be
[11:18] lost. And I'm so
[11:21] glad he was
[11:23] willing. Drink that bitter cup.
[11:29] Although he
[11:31] prayed, "Father, let it pass from
[11:38] me." I'm so glad he didn't
[11:43] call heaven's angels.
[11:49] from my
[11:50] hands. Pull these nails and set me
[11:56] free.
[11:58] Oh, had it not
[12:00] been for a place called th
[12:07] Calary? And had it not been for the
[12:13] old cross.
[12:18] Oh, had it not
[12:22] been oh called
[12:27] Jesus then
[12:30] forever my soul will be
[12:35] lost. And if that is in
[12:41] love, then the
[12:45] ocean is
[12:49] bright. There's no stars in the
[12:56] sky and the
[12:59] sparrow can fly.
[13:04] Oh, if that is in
[13:10] [Music]
[13:12] love in
[13:16] heaven, there's no
[13:19] feeling like
[13:23] this. Oh, if that is Oh, let's sing that
[13:28] again now.
[13:29] say, "Oh, if that is in
[13:36] love, then the
[13:39] ocean is
[13:44] dry. There's no stars in the sky.
[13:52] And the
[13:54] sparrow can't
[13:59] fly if that is in
[14:05] love.
[14:08] Oh, it's a
[14:11] man. There's no
[14:13] feeling like this.

[42:18] [Music]
[42:20] That's why we offer him my
[42:23] [Applause]
[42:25] everything. That's why we bow down and
[42:29] worship this king. For he gave
[42:34] his
[42:35] [Music]
[42:36] name. Yes, he gave. Oh, that's why we
[42:40] praise
[42:42] him. Oh, that's why we praise him.
[42:47] That's why we sing.
[42:50] That's why
[42:52] [Music]
[42:55] we That's why we bow down and worship
[43:00] this
[43:01] king. For he gave his
[43:06] everything. Yes, he
[43:09] gave his everything.
[43:14] Hallelujah. I'm thankful he did. He gave
[43:17] us everything. Gave his life.
[43:19] Amen. For me, aren't you glad that he
[43:22] did that for you, too? Amen. Let's go to
[43:24] a prayer. Father, just want to thank you
[43:27] again. How much we appreciate you and
[43:30] thank you for your grace and mercy and
[43:32] love and kindness that you bestowed upon
[43:35] us, Lord. The grace that we feel tonight
[43:38] in our lives, Lord. How how wonderful
[43:41] that is, Lord. We just want to ask you
[43:42] once again to come by and speak to our
[43:45] hearts. you know the needs of the people
[43:47] that's gathered here tonight. You know
[43:49] the visitors that are among us, their
[43:50] hearts cry, their needs. We just ask,
[43:53] Lord, that you would come and minister
[43:55] to each one. Father, Lord, you'll take
[43:57] me out of the way, Lord. If there be
[43:59] anything we've done or said that not be
[44:01] pleasing to you, Father, we just want to
[44:04] ask God, you bring your forgiveness and
[44:05] mercy and grace once again upon our
[44:08] lives, we ask you for your glory in
[44:11] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. in Ephesians
[44:15] chapter 6, also Exodus 14, if you
[44:24] would. Amen.
[44:28] Lord, Amen. gave me the sermon during
[44:32] the night. He just spoke these words to
[44:33] me as I was dreaming that I was
[44:35] ministering. I heard myself speak these
[44:37] words on faith to stand. Amen. And I
[44:40] believe we got to have faith to stand in
[44:42] this hour that we're living in. Amen.
[44:45] Ephesians 6 and verse 10 says, "Finally,
[44:47] my brethren, be strong in the Lord and
[44:50] in the power of his might and put on the
[44:54] whole armor of God that you may be able
[44:55] to stand against the ws of the devil.
[44:58] For we wrestle not against flesh and
[45:00] blood, but against
[45:01] principalities, against powers, against
[45:04] rulers of the darkness of this world,
[45:06] against spiritual wickedness in high
[45:08] places.
[45:10] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[45:12] of God, that you may be you may a be
[45:15] able to withstand in the evil day, and
[45:18] having done all to stand, stand
[45:21] therefore. Also in Exodus 14 and verse
[45:25] 13, and Moses said unto the people, fear
[45:28] ye not, stand still, and see the
[45:31] salvation of the Lord, which he will
[45:34] show to you today. For the Egyptians
[45:36] whom you've seen today, you shall see
[45:38] them again. no more forever. And the
[45:41] Lord shall fight for you and ye shall
[45:43] hold your peace. Amen. We'll let you be
[45:51] seated. We, as we know, are in a
[45:54] constant battle, constant fight. The
[45:57] enemy, as we read here, we were warned
[46:00] against powers and principalities, not
[46:03] against flesh and blood as as we could
[46:05] read about David and the mighty men did
[46:07] as they fought the Philistines or
[46:09] different ones or the Egyptians, but we
[46:12] fight against a power that is unseen but
[46:14] yet is very real. I I I I uh it's
[46:19] wonderful to know that even even
[46:21] sicknesses and things are actually uh is
[46:24] a spirit, brother. Uh Jesus would look
[46:26] at that and he would say, "Thou spirit
[46:28] come out of them. Thou infirmity, thy
[46:29] spirit come out." Then he would show us
[46:31] that we're wrestling, amen, against
[46:34] spiritual principalities, against
[46:36] powers, against the rulers of the
[46:38] darkness of this world, against
[46:40] spiritual wickedness in high places. And
[46:43] and and that's where he's trying to keep
[46:45] us from is that high place. Amen. That
[46:47] place where we belong, seated together
[46:49] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. So
[46:52] we're therefore in a constant fight. And
[46:54] the enemy is waring against us
[46:56] constantly. And it seems sometimes, you
[46:58] know, we can fight in the same battle
[47:00] for days and weeks and sometimes, you
[47:03] know, even years. And the darts of the
[47:05] enemy just keep coming and coming and
[47:07] sometimes it feels like you fight till
[47:10] you have nothing left to fight with. All
[47:12] your strength is gone. So, you know, you
[47:14] ask the question, what do I do? Stand.
[47:18] Stand therefore. Now, you know, you just
[47:20] say, "Well, am I just supposed to stand
[47:21] here and make it easier for the enemy to
[47:23] hit me?" That's what it would sound
[47:25] like, right? Amen. Usually, a a target
[47:28] that is is just in one place is is a lot
[47:31] easier to hit than a moving target. But
[47:33] this is not what he's what he's even
[47:35] talking about. He he's speaking about
[47:37] stand is to stand firm or to be constant
[47:40] or to persevere. Amen. It's it's not
[47:43] just to stand there in a passive
[47:45] position, but it's actually an active
[47:48] position. He didn't say do nothing, but
[47:50] he said stand firm. You're standing firm
[47:53] in the faith and faith on the word of
[47:56] God. And and then this place where your
[47:58] strength ends and it's the place where
[48:00] your strength ends and the power of God
[48:03] takes over you. Amen. because he was
[48:05] saying at the beginning of our reading,
[48:07] he said, "We're standing, amen, in a
[48:09] place, a a place, a position, amen, in
[48:13] the power of his might." If you're
[48:16] standing today, it's not because you
[48:17] have any strength. It's not because
[48:19] you've done anything or you you you
[48:22] accomplished something on your own.
[48:23] You're standing today because of the
[48:26] power of his might. Amen. And so we we
[48:29] we see in other places as we would look
[48:31] into this thought on standing and we see
[48:33] the children of Israel uh uh all
[48:36] surrounded by the enemy on all sides and
[48:38] it looked hopeless and it looked
[48:40] impossible. And I want to break into
[48:41] that for a moment. I'm I'm kind of
[48:44] change a little bit. 2 Corinthia or
[48:45] Chronicles 20 and verse one. And the mo
[48:48] children of Moab and the children of
[48:49] Ammon and and the Amorites were all
[48:52] against them and against Jehoshaphat in
[48:54] the battle. And and you know it seemed
[48:56] impossible. It was a great multitude and
[48:58] and this is what Jehoshaphat even said.
[49:00] He said, "It's a great h multitude
[49:02] that's become against us." And and he
[49:04] feared and he set himself aside to seek
[49:07] the Lord. And and he began to proclaim a
[49:09] fast throughout all Judah. And Judah
[49:12] gathered himself together and asked help
[49:14] of the Lord. And you know, Jehoshaphat
[49:16] stood in the congregation and he began
[49:18] to cry out these words. He said, "Oh
[49:20] Lord God of our fathers, art now thou
[49:22] not God in heaven and rulest not thou
[49:25] over all the kingdoms of heaven? In thy
[49:27] hand is there not power and might so
[49:29] that none is able to withstand thee? Art
[49:32] thou not our God who does drive out the
[49:35] inhabitants of the land before the
[49:36] people of Israel and gave this for a
[49:39] seed to the thy seed of Abraham thy
[49:41] friend forever?" and he begins to unload
[49:44] his heart and he begins to call upon God
[49:46] and he begins to praise him for what
[49:48] he's done and he begins to look back and
[49:51] say, "Hey God, you did this so I know if
[49:53] you did it then you can do it now."
[49:56] He's standing in a place but he's not
[49:58] standing there passively or just a open
[50:01] target, but he's seeking God and he's
[50:03] asking God to move on his behalf and and
[50:06] and and he stood there and he said, "Oh
[50:08] God, Amen. We're our our eyes are looked
[50:11] towards you." Amen. We're our eyes are
[50:13] upon thee. We don't know where else to
[50:15] turn. And and you know that's not a bad
[50:17] place to be. Amen. Because sometimes our
[50:19] eyes are on what a doctor says or what
[50:21] our own thought says or what everybody
[50:23] else says. Amen. But many times God gets
[50:26] us to a place that we can only turn our
[50:28] eyes towards where he's at. Amen. And he
[50:31] said, and when they turn their eyes
[50:33] towards him, then they heard from
[50:35] heaven. And Jehazel, Amen. And the the
[50:38] spirit of God came upon and he said,
[50:40] "Hearken all ye Judah and inhabitants of
[50:43] Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat,
[50:45] thus saeth the Lord unto you, be not
[50:48] afraid, nor dismayed by reason of this
[50:50] great multitude, for the battle is not
[50:53] yours, but God's."
[50:56] Amen. The battle is not yours, but
[50:58] God's. But you'll go down against them,
[51:00] and you'll find them. He told him where
[51:02] they was going to be. And you'll need
[51:04] not fight in this battle, but set
[51:06] yourselves and stand ye still and see
[51:09] the salvation of the Lord. Oh Judah and
[51:11] Jerusalem, fear not, nor be dismayed.
[51:14] Tomorrow go out against them, and the
[51:16] Lord will be with you.
[51:20] Hallelujah. Amen. See, they begin to
[51:22] they begin to go out and they and
[51:24] Jehoshhatz, he put worshippers before
[51:27] them and praisers before them. Amen.
[51:29] See, standing firm, praising God in the
[51:32] face of being surrounded by the enemy.
[51:35] That's powerful. Amen. That you can look
[51:37] at your enemy and praise God.
[51:41] That you can look at your circumstances
[51:43] and praise God regardless. Amen. Because
[51:46] your God is greater than your problem.
[51:49] Your God is greater than your
[51:51] circumstances. See, praise is not what
[51:53] comes after. It's what takes you to the
[51:56] victory.
[51:58] Come on, somebody. Somebody said it like
[52:00] this is that praise is not a caboose
[52:02] that comes after, but it's actually the
[52:04] engine that takes you to victory.
[52:08] Come on, somebody. Amen. This is what
[52:10] we're talking about. We're not talking
[52:11] about standing as a standing still
[52:13] target and the devil's got a more of a
[52:15] bullseye on you. No, I'm standing there,
[52:17] but I'm standing behind the word of God.
[52:20] And I'm have my hands lifted. And I'm
[52:22] I'm praising him in spite of my
[52:24] circumstances. And I'm praising him in
[52:26] spite of my fears. And I'm praising him
[52:28] in spite of my sickness. And I'm
[52:30] praising him in spite of all the enemy I
[52:33] see around me. I'm praising him in spite
[52:35] of the doctor's report.
[52:37] I'm praising him in spite if I have to
[52:39] have surgery or if I don't have to have
[52:41] surgery. If I have to take medicine, if
[52:43] I don't have to take it. I am still
[52:45] praising God no matter what.
[52:51] Amen. And so and through their praises,
[52:53] Amen. It was in their praises God set
[52:56] ambushments against their enemies and he
[52:58] slew every one of them.
[53:01] Amen. Sometimes we don't understand how
[53:03] powerful praise really is.
[53:06] Hallelujah. Amen. You know, but many
[53:08] times we ask God to do things and we ask
[53:11] him to heal. We ask him to deliver. ask
[53:13] him to say and then if he don't do it
[53:15] just the way we ask it or we might say
[53:17] he never answered. When we do that, it
[53:20] weakens our faith in God.
[53:23] Amen. It weakens our testimony when we
[53:25] don't just take him at his word and
[53:28] stand there.
[53:30] Just stand there. God always answers.
[53:35] God always answers. Can you bump these
[53:37] up a little bit? They work good. God
[53:39] always answers. Jesus said, "Ask and ye
[53:42] shall receive. Seek and you shall find.
[53:45] Everyone that asks will receive.
[53:46] Everyone that seeks shall find. Anyone
[53:48] that knocks, it will be open to him."
[53:50] The only way to get anything from God is
[53:53] to take him at his word and believe it
[53:55] the way he sends it.
[53:58] Amen. He not he may not send the answer
[54:00] the way you thought it was going to
[54:01] come, but God always answers. Amen. As
[54:05] long as you can stand upon the word of
[54:06] God. He said, "But if we just not take
[54:08] him at, you know, just the way we think
[54:10] it ought to be and the way we've asked
[54:12] for it be. We've made God into an idol.
[54:14] That God does it the way we asked him to
[54:16] do it. He's got the answer. It's
[54:17] according to our ways." Well, it's just
[54:19] no good. It didn't answer me because you
[54:21] know why? It didn't come the way I
[54:22] thought it was going to come or or the
[54:24] way I expected it was going to come. God
[54:26] answers in many ways.
[54:30] Sometimes, you know, we want we want God
[54:32] to heal. And I how many believes God's a
[54:34] healer? But God answers many different
[54:36] ways.
[54:38] Amen. He can answer sometimes with a
[54:40] miracle and take it completely out of
[54:42] your body. Or he can answer through
[54:44] healing. And healing can come in many
[54:46] ways. He can use doctors. He can answer
[54:48] that way. He can use medicine. He can
[54:50] answer that way. He can use Amen. Amen.
[54:52] Just the healing power of God. But no
[54:54] matter what, it's God's healing power
[54:57] working on the inside of you.
[55:00] Because we know doctors only assist.
[55:02] Medicine only assists. It's not the
[55:04] healing powers. God's a healer. Amen.
[55:08] Amen. So, we see, you know, we see that
[55:10] many times things comes in a peculiar
[55:13] way and and everything kind of odd. We
[55:15] don't don't expect it that way. You
[55:17] know, you can look at Moses's life and
[55:19] and Moses was 80 years old. And many of
[55:21] us would think, well, that's too old for
[55:23] God to deal with, you know, to do
[55:25] anything with him. He's an old man. He's
[55:27] unexpected. It's unexpected his age to
[55:29] be to God to use him. Another thing, you
[55:32] know, he came to Mount Horb as an
[55:33] unexpected place. God met him in an
[55:36] unexpected time, an unexpected place, in
[55:38] an unexpected way. God didn't meet Moses
[55:41] the way he usually met men. He met Moses
[55:44] in an unusual way, the way he chose to
[55:47] meet Moses.
[55:48] Come on. That's the way he answers our
[55:51] prayers is the way he chooses to answer
[55:53] our prayers. It ain't the way I choose
[55:56] it. It's the way he chooses it. It ain't
[55:58] the time I choose. It's the time he
[56:00] chooses.
[56:03] Amen. Some of you have dealt with things
[56:05] for years, uh sicknesses for years, or
[56:07] or you've been crying out to God for
[56:09] your salvation of your children for
[56:11] years. Just stand therefore.
[56:14] Stand on it anyhow. It doesn't matter if
[56:17] the wind seem to get stronger and and
[56:19] the storm seems to get worse and and the
[56:21] problem seem to persist night after
[56:23] night and day after day. Stand on the
[56:26] word. His word said by my stripes I am
[56:30] healed.
[56:34] By his stripes I'm healed. That's the
[56:36] way it's all. He's always right.
[56:40] God is always right. His timing is
[56:43] always right.
[56:46] It may not be our timing the way we want
[56:48] it and the way we expect it, but God is
[56:51] always right.
[56:54] makes us, you know, if if we don't if we
[56:56] think it will it ought to happen this
[56:57] way, then it makes us let loose and we
[57:00] fall back and we don't stand. But let's
[57:03] ask God and then stand on the word
[57:07] and don't back off of that word. Doesn't
[57:09] matter if the fever gets worse or the
[57:11] swelling gets worse or the problem gets
[57:13] worse or or your child gets worse. It
[57:15] doesn't matter. Those are just
[57:17] circumstances.
[57:20] And people are real good about praising
[57:22] circumstances and and lifting up
[57:24] circumstances and exalting
[57:25] circumstances. I ain't here to exalt
[57:28] circumstances. I'm here to exalt the
[57:30] greatest God. Amen. The most powerful
[57:33] force that's ever been known to man. The
[57:36] most powerful thing that you can stand
[57:38] upon, the word of God.
[57:43] His word remains when the doctor's
[57:45] report changes.
[57:50] His word remains when your child comes
[57:53] home. His word is still the same. Or if
[57:56] they don't come home, he's still the
[57:57] same. Or if it's months or years that
[58:00] you're you've been asking God and you've
[58:01] been seeking God and you've been looking
[58:03] for God and you've been wondering, "How
[58:05] is this going to be?" God's got the
[58:06] right time. God's got the right moment.
[58:09] He's got the answer and it may be on the
[58:11] way.
[58:13] That ain't the time to give up when the
[58:15] answer's on the way. That ain't the time
[58:17] to say, "Well, maybe it ain't so. Maybe
[58:19] it's just another time. Maybe I'll get
[58:21] it." No, I'm standing up on the word of
[58:23] God. When he comes, will he find faith?
[58:32] Many times it becomes in a way it's kind
[58:35] of disguised and we thought wow how
[58:37] could was that God? But no matter the
[58:40] way it comes if we have asked we shall
[58:42] receive.
[58:45] He did not say ask and you might
[58:47] receive.
[58:50] He didn't say that. He said you shall
[58:52] receive.
[58:54] Amen. So
[58:57] who if you ask you will receive God said
[58:59] so and that settles it forever if God
[59:01] said it. When you get to talking to God
[59:03] like that and believing it. Moses what
[59:06] if he had said well I prayed for God to
[59:07] make me a military
[59:09] man and here he's told me I got a
[59:14] stick. I asked him for an army and he
[59:16] gave me a donkey and a child and a
[59:20] wife. I asked him for shields and swords
[59:23] and all I got to show for myself was a
[59:29] rod. It was an unexpected thing. It how
[59:33] it was very unexpected for Moses. Amen.
[59:35] He was hiding from God, matter of fact.
[59:38] And he was out on the back side of the
[59:40] desert. It was an unexpected morning
[59:42] that that God came down on a hillside
[59:44] and and a burning bush started coming
[59:46] appearing and he said, "I'm going to
[59:48] turn aside and see what this is because
[59:49] this bush has been on fire and it ain't
[59:51] burned up yet. Something's up." And so
[59:52] he walks up there and a voice speaks out
[59:55] of it.
[59:57] And calls him Moses.
[1:00:01] Hello. Did you catch that? He didn't
[1:00:04] call him Bob or John or He called him
[1:00:06] Moses.
[1:00:08] God knew who he was. Yeah, Moses might
[1:00:11] have forgot about it. Moses might have
[1:00:13] forgot who he was and what he was sent
[1:00:15] to do. He had been told all of his life
[1:00:16] he was born to be a deliverer and he
[1:00:18] tried to do it. But 40 years on the back
[1:00:20] side of a desert, he might have forgot
[1:00:22] all about it. But God never forgot.
[1:00:25] And he said, "Moses, take off your shoes
[1:00:28] cuz the ground you're standing on is
[1:00:30] holy ground."
[1:00:32] That was
[1:00:34] unexpected. Not every day do you walk
[1:00:36] out in the bush burning. It's on fire
[1:00:38] but ain't consumed. Is that happen? Is
[1:00:41] that every day occurrence? No. No. No.
[1:00:43] Matter of fact, it's only happened about
[1:00:45] one time in recorded
[1:00:49] history. There's another bush that got a
[1:00:51] whirling wind in it. I know
[1:00:54] that. Amen. But see, it was
[1:00:57] unexpected. Moses could have looked at
[1:00:59] that and said,
[1:01:02] "Well, it wasn't exactly how I thought
[1:01:04] it was going to be.
[1:01:06] That wasn't exactly the way I thought I
[1:01:08] was going to get healed or or thought it
[1:01:10] would happened a long time ago. I
[1:01:11] thought God had delivered 40 years ago,
[1:01:16] but it was God's timing. God had said it
[1:01:19] for over 400 years ago that he's going
[1:01:22] to bring them out with a mighty hand. He
[1:01:23] wasn't going to let that promise fall to
[1:01:24] the ground. He was going to fulfill it.
[1:01:28] Amen. So, he just waited for the right
[1:01:30] time. Amen. For the man to get in the
[1:01:32] right place. What do you mean the right
[1:01:34] place? He was on the back side of the
[1:01:36] desert. I'm talking about on the inside
[1:01:37] where he could receive something.
[1:01:41] Come on, somebody. Where he could
[1:01:43] receive, Amen. the voice to speak to
[1:01:45] him. God has allowed some of y'all to go
[1:01:47] through things in your life to get you
[1:01:49] to the right place that the I am can go
[1:01:51] to talking to you. That the I am can go
[1:01:55] to revealing himself to you and show
[1:01:57] you, I still know who you are. You might
[1:02:00] have been in a sickness a long time, but
[1:02:02] I still know who you are. Amen. Your
[1:02:04] sons and your daughters are out there,
[1:02:06] but I still know their name.
[1:02:13] So many times we get all in a place
[1:02:15] where we can't stand still. We get all
[1:02:18] nervous and tore
[1:02:20] up. You know, just as we start to do
[1:02:22] something good, trouble comes.
[1:02:26] Yeah, that's the way it is. That's the
[1:02:28] devil trying to upset the program of
[1:02:30] God. You find that in your individual
[1:02:32] lives. You see it in the church world.
[1:02:35] You see it even in in the political
[1:02:37] realms. Stuff is getting stirred up.
[1:02:40] Who's doing it? Well, it's them
[1:02:42] Democrats. No, it's the devil.
[1:02:46] Republicans or Democrats.
[1:02:49] Come on. Well, it's Russia. No, it's the
[1:02:52] devil.
[1:02:53] Well, it's Trump. No, it's the devil.
[1:02:56] He's the ruler of the kingdoms.
[1:03:00] Amen. So he keeps it all stirred up and
[1:03:03] the church world is stirred up and you
[1:03:05] know it's the way we get it. But he said
[1:03:07] if we we can know that when we're
[1:03:09] getting ready to do right wrong is
[1:03:11] always there to resist.
[1:03:14] Come on. You know how it was when you
[1:03:16] started to feel in the pull to give your
[1:03:18] heart to God. It was a spirit that said,
[1:03:20] "No, not this service. Maybe next
[1:03:22] Sunday. Maybe maybe on the next not not
[1:03:24] this one. No, don't go for prayer
[1:03:27] tonight. Don't do that tonight. go. You
[1:03:29] know, it's like to carry it out there in
[1:03:30] front of the horses on to the next
[1:03:32] service. On to the next service. And the
[1:03:33] devil will keep you defeated for a long
[1:03:35] time. Amen. But when you realize, hey,
[1:03:38] tonight's my night. This is my time.
[1:03:41] This is my service. Amen. I can have an
[1:03:43] answer from God. I can have what I've
[1:03:45] been requesting. I've been looking for.
[1:03:47] Amen. Maybe tonight is my night. So, I'm
[1:03:50] going to stand upon the word of God.
[1:03:57] This great hour of frustration and
[1:03:59] frustration, the Lord
[1:04:01] spoke, spoke through
[1:04:03] Jehaziel, stand still and see the
[1:04:06] salvation of the Lord. You'll not fight
[1:04:09] this
[1:04:11] battle. You'll not fight this battle.
[1:04:14] You know he said in this great hour
[1:04:16] where the great church people and great
[1:04:18] churches are stewing and fussing with
[1:04:20] each other and denominational barriers
[1:04:21] are breaking us apart and we battle from
[1:04:23] this side to that side. It's time to
[1:04:25] stand still.
[1:04:27] Stand on the word of God. It's God's
[1:04:29] battle. It ain't my battle who's going
[1:04:32] to be in the bride.
[1:04:35] Ain't my battle who's in and who's out.
[1:04:38] He said all the father has given me will
[1:04:40] come.
[1:04:42] That's his battle. The battle is the
[1:04:44] Lord's.
[1:04:46] Sure. He wants to keep us all stirred up
[1:04:48] and worried and freating. How's it going
[1:04:50] to be? How is this going to come to
[1:04:51] pass? How that How are we going to get
[1:04:53] to this place? How what's it going to
[1:04:55] take? What what it ain't my battle. It's
[1:04:58] God's battle.
[1:05:02] Children of Israel had to have faith to
[1:05:05] stand. As we read at the Red Sea, they
[1:05:08] were trapped. Could look in cliffs and
[1:05:10] mountains on both sides, the sea in
[1:05:12] front of them. Maybe that's the way you
[1:05:13] feel tonight. There ain't no way out of
[1:05:15] this situation. I'm in brother Timothy.
[1:05:17] See in front of them Pharaoh and his
[1:05:19] army behind them all covered on all four
[1:05:22] sides. But they they forgot for just a
[1:05:25] moment there was an angel that was with
[1:05:27] them.
[1:05:30] Because they begin to cry out, murmur
[1:05:31] and complain, you know, is there not any
[1:05:33] graves in Egypt? We could just die
[1:05:34] there. All of our forefathers are be
[1:05:37] buried there anyway. Is there not could
[1:05:39] was there not another spot for me to be
[1:05:40] buried there? Why' I have to come out
[1:05:41] here and die? and they begin to complain
[1:05:43] and fuss and murmur and all of a sudden
[1:05:46] that whirl of fire that had been leading
[1:05:48] them and they I I'm sorry I I I I don't
[1:05:52] I can't hardly compute to a people that
[1:05:55] could be in that that condition that
[1:05:57] that would have a fire leading them and
[1:06:00] then go stand between them and their
[1:06:02] enemy
[1:06:03] and still fussing and carrying
[1:06:07] on. Come on. Well, let me tell you, we
[1:06:10] got the same kind of fire.
[1:06:13] That fire has not left the church of the
[1:06:16] living God. I want you to understand, if
[1:06:18] you have prayed the prayer of faith,
[1:06:19] that fire is standing between you and
[1:06:21] that sickness.
[1:06:23] If you have called on God, amen, for
[1:06:25] your children, that fire is standing
[1:06:27] between your children in hell.
[1:06:30] That fire is standing there. It is still
[1:06:33] standing there today. And many times we
[1:06:35] think our circumstance or our enemy is
[1:06:37] between us and our God. No, no. It's God
[1:06:40] that's standing between us and our
[1:06:42] enemy. It's God that is standing between
[1:06:45] you and that sickness or it destroyed
[1:06:48] you a long time ago.
[1:06:53] One time when the test was on, covenant
[1:06:55] people would come out of Egypt led by
[1:06:57] the Holy Spirit.
[1:07:00] They come they come through they come
[1:07:02] through the Red Sea and they had went in
[1:07:04] through the wilderness and we we save
[1:07:07] time but they come to another crossing
[1:07:10] the Jordan
[1:07:11] River and Moses has sent 12 spies across
[1:07:15] there and 10 of them come back said wait
[1:07:17] wait wait a minute we they they're too
[1:07:20] big we're too
[1:07:22] small this is
[1:07:24] impossible but there were two that went
[1:07:26] over there and they came back with a
[1:07:29] different report Now there's 10 that
[1:07:30] says nope impossible. Two that says
[1:07:33] possible. We're more than able.
[1:07:37] Not even talking about possible. We're
[1:07:39] talking about more than able.
[1:07:41] We're not talking about might be. We're
[1:07:43] talking about more than able.
[1:07:47] Come on. Amen. The church world for the
[1:07:49] majority in this hour saying, "Amen. The
[1:07:51] days of miracles are passed." They're
[1:07:53] saying, "God doesn't heal like he used
[1:07:55] to. God doesn't save like he used to."
[1:07:57] But there's still some that's standing
[1:07:59] here today said we're not just able. Our
[1:08:01] God's not just able. He's more than
[1:08:03] able.
[1:08:05] Listen, I'll stand in the face of cancer
[1:08:07] and defy that devil. I don't care how
[1:08:09] loud it scream. I'll stand in the face
[1:08:11] of brain. I don't care how loud it
[1:08:13] scream. Amen. My God's not just able.
[1:08:16] He's more than
[1:08:19] able.
[1:08:22] Apparently, they they got to looking at
[1:08:24] how big their enemy was and they forgot
[1:08:26] how big their God was. Listen, that's
[1:08:29] what the mountain wants you to do. You
[1:08:31] got a mountain before you. It might be
[1:08:33] brain issues. It might be sugar I be. It
[1:08:35] might be whatever it is. It can be right
[1:08:37] before you and that mountain begin to
[1:08:39] squall and holler and scream at you just
[1:08:41] as like like that like that spirit or
[1:08:43] that demon did to that man. He said,
[1:08:45] "Boo." move, you know, and he didn't
[1:08:46] jump back. And he said when he did, he
[1:08:48] got smaller and the spirit got bigger.
[1:08:50] He said, "Well, all of a sudden, he hit
[1:08:51] up against something."
[1:08:54] Kept going back, getting smaller and
[1:08:55] smaller and smaller till he's getting
[1:08:57] almost felt like I ain't no way I'm
[1:08:59] going to get out of this situation. He's
[1:09:01] too big. But all of a sudden, he said
[1:09:03] something that was bigger.
[1:09:06] And he grabbed a hold of that word, he
[1:09:08] said, "Boo devil." And when he said it,
[1:09:10] amen, the devil got smaller and he got
[1:09:12] bigger. Boo devil. He got small, bigger,
[1:09:14] and the devil got smaller. Amen. I think
[1:09:17] it's time we start continuing with the
[1:09:19] promises of God.
[1:09:21] That cancer wants to scream boo. I
[1:09:23] scream boo back. By his stripes, we are
[1:09:26] healed.
[1:09:29] That devil wants to say your children's
[1:09:30] never coming home. I say boo back.
[1:09:33] That's right. I say boo back. They shall
[1:09:36] be there and their offspring with them.
[1:09:39] That's right. It's time we take the word
[1:09:41] of God and we stand upon it. It doesn't
[1:09:44] matter how I feel. It doesn't matter
[1:09:46] what I feel, what I see around me. It
[1:09:49] only matters what he
[1:09:52] said. Hallelujah. It's time we deny our
[1:09:56] feelings and make our God bigger than
[1:09:58] our feelings. It's time we deny our
[1:10:00] circumstances and make our God bigger
[1:10:02] than our circumstances.
[1:10:09] Caleb stealed the people and says, "We
[1:10:11] are well able to go over and take it."
[1:10:13] Matter of fact, I found a good spot to
[1:10:16] build a house.
[1:10:18] Where was that? Right on that mountain.
[1:10:21] Well, Caleb, don't you know there's
[1:10:23] giants up in that mountain? Yep. Sons of
[1:10:25] Anoch.
[1:10:26] But my God said he gave it.
[1:10:33] That's what somebody needs to do today.
[1:10:36] That giant got your child by the throat
[1:10:38] and he's saying he ain't going to let
[1:10:39] him go, but my God gave it.
[1:10:43] That's my inheritance. That's what God
[1:10:45] gave me. I'm not backing up. I'm not
[1:10:48] bowing. I'm not bending. I don't care
[1:10:50] how bad it looks and how bad the
[1:10:51] circumstances look. I could care less
[1:10:53] what the devil looks like.
[1:10:56] I could care less if he's got one or a
[1:10:58] thousand or 10,000 or 10 million. I know
[1:11:01] there's more with me than there is
[1:11:03] against me.
[1:11:05] And if God be for us, who can be against
[1:11:07] us?
[1:11:20] Many times we don't recognize it to be
[1:11:21] God. When he
[1:11:24] answers, we must recognize that he is
[1:11:27] God and he changes not.
[1:11:31] He said, "I think that's a very needy
[1:11:33] thing today is for the people to stand
[1:11:37] still and see what God has promised.
[1:11:43] Remember his promises. They are true and
[1:11:46] amen. It's a day that God, this is a day
[1:11:49] that God is fulfilling his promises." So
[1:11:52] all this worry and fear and every
[1:11:53] anxiety and turmoil around us, these
[1:11:55] things must be part of the prophecy.
[1:11:59] Amen. the governments and wars and
[1:12:01] rumors of wars and all this stuff that's
[1:12:03] going on. These things must be
[1:12:07] amen. They they've got to come. But in
[1:12:09] the middle of it, don't forget God is
[1:12:11] still fulfilling his promises.
[1:12:14] All that stuff happens to try to keep
[1:12:15] our eyes off of what's really important.
[1:12:18] That in the middle of all this turmoil,
[1:12:20] in the middle of all this stuff going on
[1:12:21] around us, God is constantly fulfilling
[1:12:23] the prophecies, checking them off one by
[1:12:26] one by one by one by one. Come on. We've
[1:12:29] seen it happen. Amen. So when we see
[1:12:31] those things, you must just stand there
[1:12:33] and watch the promise and not the
[1:12:35] circumstance.
[1:12:38] Come on. Oh, hallelujah. If you can get
[1:12:41] your eyes off the circumstance and get
[1:12:43] your eyes on the promise, God promised
[1:12:46] you that he could heal you and he would.
[1:12:49] So get your eyes on that and get it off
[1:12:51] the circumstances.
[1:12:56] I want to read something to you that I I
[1:12:57] I read today. It's in the Passion
[1:13:00] translation, so forgive me if you don't
[1:13:01] like it, but I love it. Psalms 46 and
[1:13:04] verse one. God, you're such a safe and
[1:13:08] powerful place to find
[1:13:10] refuge. You're a proven help in time of
[1:13:14] trouble, more than enough, and always
[1:13:18] available whenever I need you.
[1:13:24] That right there's enough to just go on
[1:13:26] just have a good old shouting time.
[1:13:29] He's a proven help in the time of
[1:13:31] trouble more than enough and always
[1:13:34] available whenever I need you. So when
[1:13:38] we will never feel fear even if every
[1:13:42] structure of support has crumbled away.
[1:13:47] Huh?
[1:13:49] We will not fear when the earth quakes
[1:13:51] and shakes and there's movement of
[1:13:53] mountains and casting them into the sea.
[1:13:56] For the roaring raging roar of stormy
[1:13:58] winds and for the crashing waves cannot
[1:14:01] erode our faith in
[1:14:04] you. And David says these this word
[1:14:08] saw you know what that means? That means
[1:14:10] to pause and calmly think about it.
[1:14:15] Wait a minute. Wait, let me
[1:14:19] read. Structures of fellow crumbled,
[1:14:22] fear, earthquakes, mountains going into
[1:14:25] the sea, stormy winds, crashing waves.
[1:14:28] I'm supposed to calm, pause, and calmly
[1:14:32] think about this. You're looked at the
[1:14:34] wrong parts.
[1:14:38] We will never fear.
[1:14:43] We will not fear.
[1:14:47] because that can never erode our faith
[1:14:50] away from you.
[1:14:54] Pause and calm and think about that.
[1:14:56] It's going to take a stronger win.
[1:15:01] Hello.
[1:15:03] Listen, the devil's been trying for
[1:15:05] 6,000 years to stop it. He ain't stopped
[1:15:07] it yet. What makes you think he going to
[1:15:09] get down to 6,0001 or whatever we're at
[1:15:12] and say, "Now I got to stop." He ain't
[1:15:14] stopped it yet. said he ain't going to
[1:15:15] stop it ever.
[1:15:19] Come on. He didn't stop it with a fall.
[1:15:22] He didn't stop it with none of the
[1:15:24] nonsense he brought upon the earth. He
[1:15:26] didn't stop it with all the sin he
[1:15:27] brought upon the earth. He hasn't
[1:15:28] stopped it with a thousand time thousand
[1:15:30] demons being released. He ain't stopped
[1:15:32] it yet. He ain't going to stop it never.
[1:15:36] This word will be fulfilled.
[1:15:42] Pause and calmly. Think about that.
[1:15:45] God has constantly is a has a constantly
[1:15:49] flowing river which sparkling streams
[1:15:51] bring joy and delight to his people. His
[1:15:54] river flows right through the city of
[1:15:55] God's most high of God most high into
[1:15:58] his holy dwelling places. And God is in
[1:16:00] the midst of his city, secure and never
[1:16:03] shaken. At daybreak, his help will be
[1:16:06] seen with the appearing of the dawn.
[1:16:09] What it is? the rising of the
[1:16:13] sun. Come on. Got to look at this a
[1:16:16] little different than most people look
[1:16:17] at it, right? His help will be seen with
[1:16:20] the appearing of the dawn. It is a
[1:16:23] rising of the sun. When the nations are
[1:16:25] in uproar with their tottering kingdoms,
[1:16:27] God simply raises his voice and the
[1:16:30] earth begins to disintegrate before him.
[1:16:32] Here he comes, the commander, the mighty
[1:16:35] Lord of angel armies is on our side.
[1:16:38] Hallelujah. The God of Jacob, he fights
[1:16:41] for us. Pause and calmly. Think about
[1:16:44] that. That's right.
[1:16:47] Amen. Cancer, you're fighting us. Brain
[1:16:49] tumors, you're fighting us. Every kind
[1:16:51] of spirit is fighting us. Every kind of
[1:16:53] sickness is fighting us, which is a
[1:16:55] spirit. Amen. Every one of them are
[1:16:57] against us. But the here he comes, the
[1:16:59] commander,
[1:17:01] the mighty Lord of angel armies.
[1:17:05] Hallelujah. Of angel armies. That's the
[1:17:08] one that is on your side.
[1:17:11] I'm here to tell you the one, the God of
[1:17:13] angel armies is bigger than the God of
[1:17:15] cancer. The God of angel armies is
[1:17:17] bigger than the God of depression. The
[1:17:19] God of angel armies is bigger than the
[1:17:21] God of
[1:17:26] fear. Everyone look, come and see the
[1:17:30] breathtaking wonders of our God. For he
[1:17:33] brings both ruin and revival. He's the
[1:17:36] one who makes conflicts in throughout
[1:17:38] the earth, breaking and burning every
[1:17:39] weapon of war. Surrender your anxiety.
[1:17:45] Hello. Surrender your anxiety. Be
[1:17:49] silent. Stop your striving and you'll
[1:17:51] see that I am God. I am the God above
[1:17:54] all nations and I'll be exalted
[1:17:56] throughout the whole earth. Here he
[1:17:58] stands, the commander, the mighty Lord
[1:18:01] of angel armies. He's the one that's on
[1:18:04] our side. the God of Jacob who fights
[1:18:06] for us. I'll read in the King James
[1:18:08] version. Be still
[1:18:11] and know that I am God.
[1:18:14] When you're in sickness, know he's God.
[1:18:18] When you're surrounded and enemy all
[1:18:19] around you, still know he's God. He's in
[1:18:23] control of every situation, every
[1:18:25] sickness, every problem, anything that
[1:18:27] can come upon you.
[1:18:30] But when God gets ready to do something,
[1:18:32] the people gets tore up.
[1:18:35] That's the reason they were tore up on
[1:18:36] their journeys because, you know, they
[1:18:39] they had a mixed multitude. There was
[1:18:40] believers and
[1:18:42] non-believers. There was all kinds of
[1:18:43] things. God, you know, wants to make a
[1:18:46] move, he says, and there's usually some
[1:18:48] mixed multitude, you know, attracts the
[1:18:50] attention of a lot of different people.
[1:18:53] But when God makes a
[1:18:54] move, said you'll find isms, you'll find
[1:18:58] everything moving with it. But then the
[1:19:00] testing time
[1:19:02] comes. That's when you'll find who's
[1:19:04] truly a son or a daughter.
[1:19:07] Those who can withstand the testings.
[1:19:10] Amen. God gives them gives you a test to
[1:19:12] prove you. But when God is ready to
[1:19:14] speak, he has to steal the people and
[1:19:17] just say, "Hold up for a moment. I'm
[1:19:20] about to do something." Stand still and
[1:19:22] see the glory of God or the salvation of
[1:19:24] God. when coming up to the Red Sea. What
[1:19:26] a what a wonderful time the covenant
[1:19:28] people with the promise of God standing
[1:19:30] firm on the promise. And it's so strange
[1:19:32] to see that when people take a stand for
[1:19:34] God looks like the devil throws
[1:19:36] everything in their way. When you stand
[1:19:39] upon the word, he's going to scream.
[1:19:41] He's going to holler. He's going to try
[1:19:43] to make you
[1:19:46] doubt. It's true. It's been seen in the
[1:19:49] unseen world.
[1:19:52] In the ministry of William Brandham, he
[1:19:54] saw it. He saw he saw this cancers begin
[1:19:57] to scream out to
[1:19:58] another. Come and come and help me help
[1:20:01] me help me to make them disbelieve. They
[1:20:04] said what it was it the devil saw faith
[1:20:06] was beginning to rise in the heart and
[1:20:08] he knew when faith come up he had to go
[1:20:11] out.
[1:20:12] So he begins to scream and holler and
[1:20:14] begin to pull. This is why it's very
[1:20:16] important that atmospheres and churches
[1:20:18] you got to be very conscious of them.
[1:20:19] Amen. Because sometimes it's the devil
[1:20:21] trying to pull or the devil trying to do
[1:20:23] Amen. We don't we don't want to give
[1:20:24] heed to anything he wants.
[1:20:27] Amen. Nothing to what he desires or how
[1:20:29] he wants something to go. We mean we
[1:20:31] want to be surrendered to God and how he
[1:20:33] wants to go and how he wants to feel and
[1:20:35] how he wants to move and who he wants to
[1:20:37] touch.
[1:20:43] Some of the greatest experience you can
[1:20:44] have is when you can't get over it or
[1:20:46] under it. You just stand still and God
[1:20:49] will make a way through it.
[1:20:52] He hasn't failed yet and he never will
[1:20:53] fail. God cannot fail. It seemed the
[1:20:56] children of Israel had got up to the Red
[1:20:58] Sea and the pillar of fire leading them
[1:21:00] in armies behind them and mountains and
[1:21:02] seas and everything cutting them off. It
[1:21:04] seemed like it was impossible. Sometimes
[1:21:06] God's pl path leads right to such
[1:21:10] places. He'll lead you to the point of
[1:21:13] no return.
[1:21:16] And you have to make a choice.
[1:21:20] But you know why he does that? You know
[1:21:22] why he brings you to the places of
[1:21:23] sickness or allows you to get to those
[1:21:25] places or allows you to get in
[1:21:27] circumstances? Because God loves to
[1:21:28] display his
[1:21:34] power. I've used this before. It's such
[1:21:37] a wonderful story. Brother talk about
[1:21:39] little Joseph, his little girls. He
[1:21:42] said, "Let them come sit on his lap."
[1:21:44] You don't know how it makes me feel. One
[1:21:46] of them say, "Draw your muscles up,
[1:21:47] daddy.
[1:21:49] Draw your muscles up. Oh, you got such
[1:21:52] big
[1:21:53] muscles. Big muscles. He said, "Now,
[1:21:56] there ain't much there now, but as long
[1:21:58] as they think
[1:22:01] that, that makes me feel real
[1:22:04] good." Our heavenly father likes for his
[1:22:07] children to know he's got big muscles.
[1:22:11] He can do things for you. Sometimes he
[1:22:14] said, "I'll even bring the conversation
[1:22:16] up with my children that it'll lead just
[1:22:18] to
[1:22:20] that." Come on, somebody. Amen. I just
[1:22:24] love to hear him say it. He said, "I
[1:22:25] used to be a boxer." He said, "But I'm
[1:22:27] getting old and I'm fat and flabby and
[1:22:29] decrepit." I've seen him. I don't know
[1:22:30] what he would think about some of
[1:22:33] us, but he said, "I'm fat and flabby and
[1:22:35] decrepit now, but I still like to think
[1:22:38] that I'm back like I used to
[1:22:40] be. That I'm still got what I used to
[1:22:42] have. I still have that youth and that
[1:22:44] vigor that I used to have. But there's
[1:22:46] one thing about God.
[1:22:50] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:22:52] forever. There is no old age in him.
[1:22:56] There is no decline in him.
[1:22:59] There is no stoop in him.
[1:23:02] There is no saggy bad baggy skin in him.
[1:23:05] He's not lost a bit of his strength.
[1:23:07] He's not lost a bit of his muscle. Amen.
[1:23:10] Amen. He's as just as eternal as he ever
[1:23:13] was. And if he's eternal as he ever was,
[1:23:16] he's still as great as he ever was. And
[1:23:19] if he's still as great as he ever was,
[1:23:21] he has just as power much power as he
[1:23:24] ever had. And if he has just as much
[1:23:27] power as he ever had, he can heal today
[1:23:29] just like he did yesterday. He can save
[1:23:32] today just like he did yesterday.
[1:23:36] Hallelujah. Sometimes he allows you to
[1:23:39] come to those places in your life. He
[1:23:42] can show you I have big muscles.
[1:23:46] I still have the abilities.
[1:23:51] I still have the abilities to open up
[1:23:53] the Red Sea. I still have the abilities
[1:23:56] to supply needs and bring down food and
[1:23:59] bring down water. I I still have the
[1:24:01] abilities, Amen, to to to just go and
[1:24:04] set ambushments against your enemy.
[1:24:08] Oh my God. I still got the ability to
[1:24:11] heal the leper. And I still got the
[1:24:13] ability to heal the blind. I still have
[1:24:16] the ability to raise the dead.
[1:24:21] If he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:24:22] forever, he still has every one of those
[1:24:24] abilities.
[1:24:26] And that's what the Bible says. So if
[1:24:28] you don't believe that, just tear it out
[1:24:29] your Bible and throw it in the trash.
[1:24:32] But I believe it and I've witnessed it.
[1:24:36] There's no old age in him. Everything
[1:24:39] that he had at the beginning, he has
[1:24:41] now. As they got to the Red Sea, God
[1:24:44] wanted to display his power. So he had
[1:24:47] the Red Sea to stand still.
[1:24:51] and he walled itself up and stand
[1:24:53] attention while that covenant little
[1:24:56] bunch of holy rollers marched through
[1:24:57] the breast of it to
[1:25:01] victory. Did you catch what he's saying?
[1:25:04] You go listen to the on the tapes on
[1:25:06] stand still or stand still and see the
[1:25:08] salvation of the Lord and couple other
[1:25:11] titles. He he begins to make a transfer.
[1:25:14] You standing still and then your enemy
[1:25:17] standing still.
[1:25:22] But the only way you going to get to
[1:25:24] your enemy standing still is you got to
[1:25:26] stand
[1:25:28] still. He said, "Watch what happened."
[1:25:31] He made the Red Sea stand
[1:25:34] still. As they begin to watch, you say,
[1:25:37] "Holy Rollers?" Yes, they were holy
[1:25:38] rollers. When they got on another side,
[1:25:40] they seen what God did. They acted like
[1:25:42] a bunch of holy rollers. You don't like
[1:25:44] holy rollers, you don't like us. One
[1:25:46] singing in the spirit, one dancing in
[1:25:48] the spirit, beating tambourines. But God
[1:25:50] had the Red Sea to stand still and watch
[1:25:53] him display deliverance to his people.
[1:25:55] His people today would only listen to
[1:25:57] him stand still to see his promise.
[1:25:59] He'll He likes to display the same thing
[1:26:01] to them today. He'll deliver his people
[1:26:03] from their bondage of sin, from their
[1:26:05] doubt, from their frustration, from
[1:26:07] their sicknesses. Every redemptive
[1:26:09] blessing that Jesus died for belongs to
[1:26:11] you.
[1:26:13] Amen. Amen. He made the sun stand still.
[1:26:16] He made the earth. He made it all stand
[1:26:18] still so God's people could be
[1:26:21] delivered.
[1:26:28] He made the fiery furnace stand still.
[1:26:31] Children of Israel are the three Hebrew
[1:26:33] children. They they made a declaration.
[1:26:35] We're not going to bow. We're not going
[1:26:36] to bend. We're not we're not worshiping
[1:26:38] that idol. We're not called We're not
[1:26:39] idol worshippers. We worship the one
[1:26:41] true living God. So do what you want to,
[1:26:43] king, but we ain't
[1:26:45] bowing. So he commanded to be heated
[1:26:47] seven times
[1:26:51] hotter. Throw them in
[1:26:55] it. Do you notice that the only thing it
[1:26:57] did any harm or killed was the ones who
[1:26:59] threw them in
[1:27:02] and it took their bands
[1:27:04] off? Next thing you know, they're loose
[1:27:06] walking around. You said, "How could
[1:27:07] these things be?" God did it. That's
[1:27:09] all.
[1:27:11] That's the only thing I can tell you. If
[1:27:13] you don't believe in that kind of God, I
[1:27:14] don't know what you I don't I don't know
[1:27:16] what you're going to
[1:27:18] do. He did it when the when Dan Daniel
[1:27:21] was thrown in the lion's den. He made
[1:27:22] the lion stand
[1:27:24] still. Hungry beasts, they had they
[1:27:27] wasn't getting fed pork chops and t-bone
[1:27:29] steaks every night. No, they were made
[1:27:30] to be hungry that when they throw
[1:27:32] somebody in, they'd go eat them. And he
[1:27:34] gets thrown in for
[1:27:36] praying, for doing something that was
[1:27:38] trapped that was set up. and he see and
[1:27:40] he gets thrown in and and he's in that
[1:27:43] lion's den and what happened? God made
[1:27:45] the lion stand still
[1:27:49] and watches his prophet. Amen. Daniel
[1:27:52] begin to pray to God in a lion's
[1:27:55] den. God allows you to get in places.
[1:27:58] But if you can get to that place, amen,
[1:28:00] to where you can just stand upon the
[1:28:02] word of God,
[1:28:04] then all of a sudden he'll make cancer
[1:28:06] stand still.
[1:28:11] Come on. We saw it happen in this very
[1:28:13] church.
[1:28:15] We saw a little woman that got under the
[1:28:17] power of the Holy Ghost apparently
[1:28:18] because there was no way she had any
[1:28:20] strength to do what she did. She was a
[1:28:21] 90 lb frail woman ate up with cancer in
[1:28:24] her lungs. But we begin to sing a song
[1:28:26] leaning on the everlasting arm. And it
[1:28:28] struck her heart on what have I to
[1:28:30] dread? What have I to fear? And out of
[1:28:32] that mezzanine she came and she began to
[1:28:34] wand run around the building giving
[1:28:37] praise to God.
[1:28:39] Come on. Giving praise to God. Somewhere
[1:28:42] between there and there cancer stood
[1:28:44] still
[1:28:46] and she left it behind.
[1:28:49] Hallelujah. Cuz she went the next day to
[1:28:51] the doctors and they took scans of her
[1:28:53] and it was all gone.
[1:28:57] Well, I say if he did it then, he can do
[1:28:59] it again. Cuz he's the same God today.
[1:29:10] You said, "Well, what I got to do?"
[1:29:11] Stand on the word.
[1:29:21] There was a blind man that was standing
[1:29:23] sitting there in Jericho. As he began to
[1:29:26] hear a
[1:29:28] noise, he be to cry out, "Thou son of
[1:29:31] David, have mercy on me." And heaven
[1:29:34] stood
[1:29:36] still. Heaven
[1:29:40] stood. As he was headed toward the
[1:29:42] cross, he hears a
[1:29:45] cry. He
[1:29:49] stops. He turned around. He says, "Who
[1:29:52] is that?" And they told him who it was.
[1:29:53] Said, "Go get him." He went and got him.
[1:29:55] He came and he touched him and he made
[1:29:59] blindness blindness stand
[1:30:02] still while man walked away with his
[1:30:05] sight. He made leprosy stand still while
[1:30:08] they walked away
[1:30:10] clean. Amen. He's that kind of God. He
[1:30:12] he he he still does that. He even made
[1:30:15] death stand still. He did it at the
[1:30:18] grave called Lazarus as he was standing
[1:30:20] there and he be to weep and cry. And
[1:30:21] people want to say, "Well, that's just a
[1:30:23] he's cuz he was human." Yeah, but he was
[1:30:24] human. I'm going to tell you what now.
[1:30:26] He was also God because God spoke and
[1:30:29] said, "Lazarus, come out of the grave."
[1:30:31] And he came out
[1:30:34] because he said, "I am the resurrection
[1:30:36] and the life." God made death stand
[1:30:38] still and Lazarus walk out.
[1:30:43] Hallelujah.
[1:30:50] I don't know how I'm gonna read this
[1:30:53] without just having a
[1:30:56] conion. Maybe I should read the warning
[1:30:58] label before I read this. God will make
[1:31:02] every sin that you ever
[1:31:04] committed. He'll make the devil that's
[1:31:06] called your soul for his own. He'll make
[1:31:08] that devil and the sin stand still
[1:31:11] tonight. Watch the power of God come
[1:31:14] down. He'll take away your sin and
[1:31:16] iniquity and he'll give you the baptism
[1:31:18] of the Holy Ghost. He'll surely do it.
[1:31:20] He'll make every cancer drop.
[1:31:22] He'll make every blind eye come open.
[1:31:25] He'll make the cripples walk. He'll let
[1:31:27] the devil who afflicted you stand still
[1:31:31] and see the glory of God. Cuz it's not
[1:31:34] your battle.
[1:31:37] This is God's battle. Don't be
[1:31:39] frustrated. Don't be frustrated. Amen.
[1:31:42] Don't be upset. Stand
[1:31:56] still. God will test you. He'll bring
[1:31:58] you to some places. We heard it last
[1:32:00] Wednesday how he did
[1:32:02] Job. I love how brother Job brought that
[1:32:04] out. He said God laid claim to him. He
[1:32:06] said, "My servant Job."
[1:32:11] But he brought him to a place. But in
[1:32:14] all of it, God, Job knew he met God's
[1:32:17] requirements. He knew he had offered a
[1:32:19] sacrifice. He confessed his sin. He had
[1:32:22] done what was right. And God said,
[1:32:24] "There's none like him in all the earth.
[1:32:27] He won't curse me no matter what you
[1:32:30] do." Maybe if your healing's lingered a
[1:32:33] little
[1:32:34] bit, it means God's got confidence in
[1:32:37] you that you'll hold on.
[1:32:43] Oh, I just love to smack that devil one
[1:32:45] more time.
[1:32:47] It ain't because you're a secret sinner
[1:32:48] or you got you done something wrong or
[1:32:50] the devil or God's mad at you. Yeah, the
[1:32:52] devil might be mad, but God ain't mad at
[1:32:54] you. It ain't because none of that. You
[1:32:57] if it has lingered for just a little
[1:32:59] bit, direct quote. God's got confidence
[1:33:02] in you that you will hold on and you
[1:33:05] will believe that the Holy Spirit brings
[1:33:07] the signs and wonders that he promised
[1:33:09] was be do that he would do and you will
[1:33:12] accept it and you will hold on because
[1:33:14] you met God's requirement.
[1:33:27] But anyway, we
[1:33:30] see it said stand still means to stand
[1:33:33] firm or to
[1:33:35] persevere. Persevere means to be
[1:33:38] persistent in a
[1:33:41] goal. It means to be fully
[1:33:45] persuaded. Doesn't matter what goes on
[1:33:48] around me, I'm going to be still
[1:33:51] persuaded. Doesn't matter if it's a
[1:33:53] strong wind that blows against me for 30
[1:33:56] years. I'm still persuaded
[1:33:58] God's still a healer.
[1:34:06] I I don't know. Maybe Brother Kenny, it
[1:34:09] ain't no accident you're here tonight.
[1:34:14] This is a dream. In my in my dream last
[1:34:16] night, I was dreaming standing here
[1:34:18] saying, "You be
[1:34:19] persistent. Stand there. Stand on the
[1:34:22] word. Don't back off from it.
[1:34:25] It'll be worth it.
[1:34:28] Stand in the faith.
[1:34:30] Hallelujah. Stand in the faith. When all
[1:34:32] hell is against you, stand. When the
[1:34:35] devil says it ain't possible, stand.
[1:34:37] When he says it's going to fall apart,
[1:34:39] stand. When he says your family will
[1:34:41] never be together, stand. When he says
[1:34:44] your children ain't coming home, stand.
[1:34:47] Hallelujah. He says you'll never be
[1:34:49] healed, stand.
[1:34:52] If he says it's impossible, it's not
[1:34:55] going to happen, I'm going to take you
[1:34:56] into death. I'm going to stand therefore
[1:34:59] in the promises of God, and I'm going to
[1:35:02] be strong in the faith, fully
[1:35:05] persuaded that my God's not able. He's
[1:35:08] more than able.
[1:35:12] Hallelujah. He wasn't just able, Brother
[1:35:15] Kenny. He's more than able tonight. He's
[1:35:19] not just able tonight to kill to heal
[1:35:21] cancer. He's more than able.
[1:35:27] Stand.
[1:35:29] Stand on the liberty that God has
[1:35:31] afforded you through the word of God.
[1:35:34] You don't have to bow down to that devil
[1:35:36] of fear. You don't have to bow down to
[1:35:38] that devil anxiety. Well, what about my
[1:35:40] child? What about this? What about that?
[1:35:42] What about it?
[1:35:44] What did God say? That's what you look
[1:35:46] at.
[1:35:48] Hallelujah. God said it.
[1:35:52] I believe it.
[1:35:54] God said it. It's done.
[1:35:58] Well, it may be 30 years. It's done.
[1:36:02] It's finished.
[1:36:04] How do you know it's finished? Because
[1:36:05] when he raised those two arms in
[1:36:08] victory, he said, "It is finished."
[1:36:12] What was he talking about? Sin no longer
[1:36:15] can reign in a mortal body. But there's
[1:36:17] a power that'll cast Satan out. That's
[1:36:20] right. Well, if it cast sin out of your
[1:36:22] life and it cast unbelief out of your
[1:36:24] life, it'll cast the devils under him
[1:36:26] out of your life.
[1:36:29] Therefore, it cast out cancer. It'll
[1:36:32] cast out brain tumors. It'll cast out
[1:36:34] every kind of thing. I've seen it
[1:36:36] happen. I know he done it and I know he
[1:36:38] will.
[1:36:41] Hallelujah. Stand still.
[1:36:47] 1 Corinthians 16:13 says, "Watch ye
[1:36:50] stand fast in the faith. Quit you like
[1:36:54] men. Be
[1:36:56] strong." 1 Corinthians 2:5 says that
[1:36:59] your faith should not stand in the
[1:37:02] wisdom of man, but in the power of God.
[1:37:06] That's where we got to stand in his
[1:37:08] power. Why are you still Why is there
[1:37:11] going to be somebody that's going to be
[1:37:12] remaining? because they're standing in
[1:37:13] his power.
[1:37:16] Because they didn't have his we didn't
[1:37:17] have his power, his life, we'd be washed
[1:37:21] away just like anybody else.
[1:37:23] God in his grace and mercy made our sin
[1:37:27] stand still. Made our unbelief stand
[1:37:30] still. Made every demon in hell that
[1:37:32] tried to hold us stand still while we
[1:37:34] walk free.
[1:37:36] So stand fast in the liberty that God
[1:37:38] has given you.
[1:37:40] He said it, I believe. Let's sing that.
[1:37:42] You believe what he said?
[1:37:45] They say mountains can't be moved,
[1:37:48] but it can.
[1:37:51] They say chain, these chains will never
[1:37:53] break, but they have.
[1:37:57] But they don't know you like we do.
[1:38:00] Cuz we're not standing in our own
[1:38:02] abilities. We're standing in the power
[1:38:04] of almighty God.
[1:38:07] [Music]
[1:38:10] They
[1:38:16] say they say these chains
[1:38:20] [Music]
[1:38:24] are but they don't know you like we do.

[2:01:03] Just want to give a little
[2:01:05] testimony I want to share with you.
[2:01:08] Sister Jennifer Mason wrote me the other
[2:01:11] day. She said, "I was healed instantly
[2:01:15] of arthritis when I went through the
[2:01:17] prayer line." This is from camp. said,
[2:01:21] "I've hurt for several months now. So
[2:01:25] much that I've had to sit in recliner
[2:01:27] about half the day because of the pain.
[2:01:30] I've been on
[2:01:31] Moxyan to slow the progression. The
[2:01:34] weekend of youth camp was the hardest
[2:01:36] ever, severe joint
[2:01:39] achiness. After the prayer line, I
[2:01:42] noticed all pain was gone, and I've
[2:01:44] hadn't had any joint pain
[2:01:47] since." I was praying in my heart that
[2:01:50] God would heal me because I have so much
[2:01:53] that I still have to do on a daily
[2:01:55] basis. I was also praying for my family.
[2:01:58] When you verbally rebuked the spirit of
[2:02:01] arthritis, it left. Honestly, honestly,
[2:02:06] I expected a gradual healing, but God
[2:02:09] gave me a miracle. And I'm so grateful.
[2:02:12] And I've stopped medication because I
[2:02:14] know I will not need it. It damages
[2:02:18] kidneys and liver after years of
[2:02:20] use. And I have been testifying to
[2:02:23] everyone of what God has done for me.
[2:02:27] Amen. I just asked today, you know,
[2:02:29] about it. I said, "Are you still walking
[2:02:31] in victory?" She said, "Absolutely. I've
[2:02:34] had no joint pain or inflammation since
[2:02:36] that night. It was really a miracle. And
[2:02:39] I thank can't thank God enough. I
[2:02:41] believe all arthritis has stopped in his
[2:02:45] tracks. Amen. Is stop in his tracks.
[2:02:50] Amen. Our God reigns. Our God's a
[2:02:52] healer. Our God's a deliverer. If he'll
[2:02:55] do it once, he'll do it twice. If he
[2:02:58] does it twice, he'll do it three times.
[2:03:00] He's a God of one chance, two chances,
[2:03:03] three chances, four chances. This God is
[2:03:05] a God who will not quit. He keeps
[2:03:08] pouring out his blessings. Amen. I want
[2:03:11] you to lay hands on one another right
[2:03:13] now while we pray. Father, in the name
[2:03:15] of Jesus Christ, I stand here as a
[2:03:18] redeemed son of God under the blood of
[2:03:21] Jesus Christ with the divine commission
[2:03:24] given to me to cast Satan out. And Lord,
[2:03:27] you know the enemy has come up against
[2:03:30] your children. And we have come tonight
[2:03:33] and heard a message as you interrupted a
[2:03:36] man's sleep to speak to him even through
[2:03:39] a spiritual dream. For you said that you
[2:03:41] that that old men would dream dreams and
[2:03:44] young men would see visions and I would
[2:03:46] pour out my spirit upon all flesh. Now
[2:03:49] Lord, while you're pouring out your
[2:03:51] spirit, oh God, drive out every enemy.
[2:03:54] Drive out every demon power, every
[2:03:57] spirit of the enemy. They go in the name
[2:03:59] of Jesus Christ and people walk in
[2:04:02] victory in Jesus name. May the sick be
[2:04:05] healed. Those that are seeking the Holy
[2:04:07] Ghost be filled. Those in needs a
[2:04:10] refreshing in and renewing in their
[2:04:12] spirit, renew it tonight, Lord. We give
[2:04:15] it to you now in Jesus name. Amen. Thank
[2:04:19] you, Lord. We believe. Hallelujah.
[2:04:22] Hallelujah. Amen. Give him
[2:04:29] [Music]
[2:04:33] praise. Hallelujah.
[2:04:35] Well, I get joy when I think about what
[2:04:39] he's done for me. I get joy when I think
[2:04:45] about Oh, I get joy when I think
[2:04:50] about Oh, what the Lord has done for
[2:04:55] me. You see, you don't know like I know
[2:05:00] what he's done for me.
[2:05:03] You don't know like I
[2:05:06] know. Oh, you don't know like I know
[2:05:11] what he's done for me. What the Lord has
