presence Lord the anointed of God we invite you now father we thank you Lord for the Gathering Together of like Precious Faith Lord we have a common theme a common desire a common a common goal today fathers believers Lord enough to put our Humanity aside and allow the word of God to work through us to hear from heaven Lord as your Prophet we'll say to hear from our theophonies we invite you now father we we lord just set aside whatever amount of time we have today God we just want to allow you the freedom to to move in our midst to deal with hearts and lives Lord however it would be however you would flow through us today God may we not hinder the movement of the spirit God made we just allow ourselves to be free free to worship not only in song but Lord as the word is going forth God may we worship you as the word God begins to flow through and come through the channel of the thought Lord Through the Bible the channel of the Mind into the depths of the spirit down into the soul father is your problem saying that's what has life in it and that brings life into us so God now may your spirit just grab hold of the word today Lord and may our Spirits grab hold of it today Father may it bring life into us God may we put our attention away from all the cares of this life and things that are going on outside of these walls today Lord and allow your allow yourself just to move Lord allow your spirit to move today God may we not hinder you today we ask it in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles this morning we're going to have you turn here to First Corinthians 15 and we're going to start at verse 35 and kind of skip around here but I want to pick back up on what I spoke to you last time on I want to speak to in your on a restored for our change restored for our change last time we spoke on Satan can't stop our change this time I want to speak on restored for our change and we look here it says in verse 35 but some man will say how are the dead raised up and what body do they come you know thank God we had a prophet because we would all Ponder this thought what body would they come in he said thou food that which sow us is not quick and accept it die and that which thou soweth thou soweth not the body that shall be but bear grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain but God giveth it a body as it had pleased him and to every seed of his own body All Flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of Flesh of men another flesh of beasts and other fishes and another of birds there is also celestial bodies and bodies of terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one in the glory of the terrestrial is another there is one glory of the son and another glory of the Moon and another glory of the stars from one star different from another star in glory so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown and incorruption or it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonor it is raised in the glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown in a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit how be it that was not the first which is spiritual but that which is natural and that word that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth Earthly the second man is of the Lord From Heaven as it is earthy such are they also that are Earthly and that is Heavenly search are they also that are Heavenly and we have borne the image of the earthy how many can say Amen to that he says we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly praise the Lord Church now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither through with corruption inherit incorruption but I'll show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound of the Dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on in corruption and this Mortal must put on immortality God bless you you can have your seats this morning mm-hmm [Music] this word changed here remember the last time we spoke it actually means to exchange from one form to another form it means to transform and brother Brandon would tell us in the message the invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says now when you see the women just go on the Rampage he says just doing anything that they want to do wash the church is doing the same thing so I bring this out because we realize the day in which we're living in we're seeing that it's a woman's age correct and we realize we're only able to see and the prophet that God will see us or would tell us a little to see a means woman in the Greek this is a woman's world it's a woman's church it's a woman's age we find out now that she's idolized she's worshiped she can pretty much do anything that she wants women have broken the glass ceiling we find women now are in in professional careers they're they're coaching professional sports or umpire professional games games that were intended only for males now the females are in that she's she's able to do whatever she wants and this is no bash against you sisters but we find that it's it's a woman's world today and when you see the woman doing that right the prophet of God will tell us but when you watch the spiritual bride he says when she begins to have a Revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God he says now watch then again you see how the scriptures at that time he said there'll be a message sweep out and catch that bride come on little bride so you just look around and you can see it's a woman's age and she's elevated she's been elevated to a place and when she's elevated to that place it's only a type that God is going to send a message and it may say God has already sent a message to catch the bride of Christ he says to catch that woman the elect so this message that God sent was to catch you to pull you out of denominational thinking to pull you out of the things of the world that's why God sent a message see this message was to catch that elect lady to catch you and draw you out of the filth of the Lord to let you know that you are of that elect to let you know that you are the bride of Christ and he says now when the people begin to try to align with the word he said there comes a fresh message so notice a fresh message not a dead letter not a message from previous ages but a fresh message a message that has life in it see a message this message wasn't just sent to tell you who you were he wasn't just sent to tell you that your bride but this message was sent to prepare your way out this message was sent to provide you a way of Escape before Israel can leave Egypt they had to have a message and before we can take our Exodus God has to send us a a message and I believe he's done that so this message was sent to change your life how many can say Amen to that it was sent to change your life change your nature change your desires and finally change your body see it was sent to restore us back to the thoughts that God had of us when it was in the back part of his mind that's what this message was sent for it wasn't sent here just so you can sit on a Pew and say I believe God sent a prophet but it was sent to do more for you than that this message was sent to to restore us back to what God had intended us to be in the beginning and notice Satan fights it he fights this little group of people he doesn't want you to be restored back to that original word he doesn't want you to be restored back to that original life he's doing everything he can to hinder the movement of the spirit and he comes even an even like Tabernacle and he'll set a critical spirit in the midst and cause the church to not Prosper cause the the word to not go forth because why because he has got a desire to keep a people beat down he's got to die keeping the people living below their privileges he's got a desire to keep the people from realizing that you're being restored back to the original word back to a body change we're not meant to be here Church we're not Earthbound chickens but we're Eagles [Applause] oh notice now he's fighting that because he knows when this change takes place his destruction is coming you say brother Joe I need a scripture on that second Thessalonians 2 and verse 7. it says for the mystery of iniquity doeth already worked only he who now let us will let until he be taken out of the way who is he the Holy Ghost where's the Holy Ghost in you this morning then shall the wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming so we find when we're taken out of the way total Destruction is coming his destruction is coming and so he's fighting every day he's fighting you he's he's combating you he may come with your children or come with your marriage or come with your finances or come with some form passion or some way but Satan is fighting you he doesn't want you to reach that place of restoration but there's been a word already pronounced over a people there's been a word already has gone forth over a people that I will restore saith the Lord there ain't enough devils in Hell there ain't enough trials and tribulations that you're going to go through in life that word has already been spoken over you brother it's already been spoken over you sister and let me just tell you you might as well get ready for the changes coming [Applause] the change is coming out some of us don't like change all y'all realize that I'm one of those somebody's that don't like change but this change I'm embracing this change I'm looking for every morning I get up between six and nine I'm waiting for a change could this be the day that I step into a new body can this be the day when all the wrinkles Panic could this be the day that my hair returns back in all the great leads can this be the day that I'm living in a new body drawing in a new place Philadelphia take some of the highs out up here that'd be great we'll look here in John 14 and verse 1 and this scripture has been on my thought all week when I was out of town just sitting there many hours on a deer stand and I was just thinking in my father's house what a place In My Father's House notice he says now John 14 and verse 1 let not your heart be troubled don't be agitated don't be distressed and anxious about what's going on around us we have a message a fresh message let me just tell you it works this message Works what about it brother Mike doesn't it work what a brother brother lingo doesn't it work this message works it changes life sister Lana doesn't work it heals cancer it delivers does it work I'll tell you this morning this message works and what God has done in a temporal he's going to do the supernatural if he can heal from cancer what about when we step into a new body when we're completely restored notice now let not your heart be anxious and trouble you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions man I gotta mention brother Derek you know I want to be tall dark and handsome I can't be Andrew Glover it's just not in the works so I just got to be who I am short Stumpy and cute but you know it works I'm married 20 plus years we're happy it's all right but I got a mansion over there about this tall oh yeah I'll tell you what I can't wait to step into that new mansion I go around and look in it you know what the old back problems are gone the knee problems are gone the wrinkles are gone the hair is back it's a new mansion it's a new body and I'm going to it and what about you brother what about you that's where we're headed a mansion on the hillside imagining Glory let me tell you ain't no Devils can keep you from that Mansion okay no child keep you from that message that's where we're headed in My Father's House and my father's told me there's a mansion waiting on me I got a body waiting on me oh Hallelujah I got a place waiting on me [Applause] oh my and he says if it were not so I would have told you but I go to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I will come again and I will receive you unto myself otherwise I will join you to myself oh my God oh my church don't get so distressed with the things of life look what the word is telling us I've gone to prepare a place for you and that where I am you're going to be there also I mean not just you but they and their offspring come on don't leave The Offspring out we're not leaving the hoof behind children Israel he said go get them all in we're not leaving a hoof behind and you might as well go tell the Israel we won't go we want silver we're not going out weak we're not going out into head but we're going out in abundance we're going out in Victory we're going out on top what are we going through to a new body oh we're gonna pack out stuff just have a change notice we received the message it's a life-changing message and then I'll come again and I'll receive you I'll join you to myself that where I am there you may be also now brother Brown tells us in the message Fellowship by Redemption he goes I never believed that heaven was a place where there's a bunch of buildings how many of you believed that back in the day oh come on just be honest don't be so messes theologies that you oh y'all never thought that in my father's house I'm gonna have me imagine I'm gonna tell you it's gonna be the biggest mansion on the Block hit no but he says I never thought or believed that heaven was a place where there's a bunch of buildings where there's a bunch of houses up there made with mortar and adopt with paper and paint on the wall he goes I'll never believed that that a supernatural being would live in a literal house but I believe when Jesus spoke in John 14 in my father's house is many mansions he meant a body a Dwelling Place oh I just love that for the scriptures verify the same thing if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting come on this is time for some of you older people say amen yes it's okay it's all right if time should tarry you got a new body waiting on you you know the older I get the more this becomes a reality we're not meant to live forever in these bodies but I know if this Earthly Tabernacle beat us off I got a new body waiting on me it don't matter how old this body gets how beat down this body gets how the crap and how it deteriorates I got a new body weight what a promise oh one one breath outside of this life when I take my last breath I'm into a new body oh well body a body that'll never get sick a body that'll never deteriorate a body that'll never perish a body that'll never grow old a body that'll never weaken Under Pressure I'm stepping into a new body a theophany body the body that God intended for us to live in and that's where you head in church and God is in the process of restoring a bride back to that body he says now mortal beings is the only one who lives in mortal habitations Immortal beings live in in Immortal habitations then the place that we go into until we return back is not a place of brick and mortar and clay and precious stones or Jewels it's a place of condition that we move out of this Dimension that we live in into another dimension it's a house a tabernacle a Dwelling Place see he has gone to prepare a place for every believer how many are believers this morning it should be a hundred percent hands up or 200 because you hopefully most of you got two hands all right he has gone to prepare a place for every believer that the very moment we step out of these mortal regions we don't go out into some myth or some Supernatural Spirit but we go into a tabernacle a dwelling place and that might be right here he said and that might be right here in this building this morning a place that no other radio activity or nothing could touch that is solely fixed by God Alone he said Moses have been dead for 800 years Elijah had been dead for around six or seven hundred years and they stood on Mount Transfiguration both of them in their mortal looks talking to Jesus just before he went to Calvary so they were in their theophany Immortal bodies he says now he goes I got a revelation the other day standing up there on Mount polymer at the observatory and seeing time and space over to Mars and to the last continents and so forth like traveling at so many thousand miles per second he said now if an angel started from the furthest storm coming here it would take billions times billions times billions of years to get here if he started From Mars and he'd come here flying at the speed of light space or the light speed it would take him billions of years to get here he goes now I cannot believe that there is a house way out yonder but I believe that that house that God was speaking of is present right here now oh my God oh my there's a dimension church that we can't see right now and the problem would tell us when when that Dimension slows down and this one speeds up what's going to happen that's going to be a transition a transition take place oh and that that Dimension slows down he's always just above your head right now it's just a few feet above you that's how close we are to the body change that's how close we are to a well body that's how close we are for living in the father's house he goes you go millions and millions of miles beyond that Dimension you'll get into a place that's just as real as television pictures here's in the room this morning if there's the Lord Jesus Christ the resurrected Son of God standing here and the reason that you can't see him is because your heart hasn't become tuned down to it and the reason we can't see the television pictures we're in our bodies we're not instruments to pick up the mechanical scent things but when our body becomes in tune with God but coming apart of him then our soul can pick up the power of the Holy Spirit to vindicate the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ and all of his power and omnipotence he has risen from the dead he lives among us today he wants Fellowship back with his people again his great Majesty his glory is now spreading forth he is Desiring Fellowship again with his people like he did in the Garden of Eden so that's why he sent a message was to he to restore Fellowship so that we once again can be on speak in terms with our savior because we understand due to the fall and separated Humanity from their God and now we fine he goes now I know that there is a lamb beyond the river there's a region Yonder somewhere that the Glorious persons of the great angels of God and his beings are fellowshipping together oh we're headed back to that we're headed back tonight I don't know what you think about about heaven I don't know what you think about these things but I'll tell you what we had a Prophet come and tell us we had a Prophet come and tell us oh let me just tell you right he says now I go to prepare a place to receive them it shows that he was speaking to them and see there's a life after this life has ended there's a life after this life has ended and what a consolation that ought to give all of us to know that after this life is over there is a life there is a life brother Ross cancer is trying to destroy your body there's a life after this one of these mornings between six and nine one of these mornings you're gonna see that life stepping through the door you're gonna wake up maybe you're sitting there at the stove cooking eggs biscuits and gravy we don't do that at my house we have burritos and and as you all heard the other day I sent brother Tim a picture this morning we were having an Arizona breakfast tortillas and eggs and it was just wonderful hot sauce I'm telling you what but one of these mornings you're gonna see that loved one that had been going on for 10 15 20 years come stepping through the door in a new body and when they come stepping in all my a change will be all what's happening while we're being restored back through the message God is placed us he's giving us something to look forward to in the morning we don't wake up every day empty-handed we wake up with an expectation oh my is this gonna be the day this is the Karen Pruitt walks through the door is this going to be the day that Gerald show walks through the door not in that old body none of that body that was grasping for breath and fighting to live put in a new body an 18 year old body a body that'll never weaken a body that'll never take a fight for breath a body that'll never have a brain bleed again but a new body a well body a the opposite body a hill body a delivered body a saved body a glorious body talking about a body talking about a tank and what's happening to the turkey she is being restored back by the message to that body oh my God he says now and as you get older he says now that becomes more of a reality to you so I'm not picking on you whole people but as you get older why that new body looks good When You're 15 17 18 you don't know what we're talking about you and your new body what y'all people talking about this is great but when you start climbing that ladder and getting north of 50 60. 70. and then the devil jumps on you with all his feet and power and everything that he has to to do and he strikes your body with cancer and that 70 year old body don't handle cancer that great and then you you used to be all tall strapping and now you're bent over now you're hobbling now you're walking on support systems and things of that name now your cabinets are full of Medicine that new body looks good a new body is all that you wake up under expectation for is this my day you know it's like when he was a kid you waited for Christmas I know many of y'all didn't do Christmas way back when let me just tell you how I did it we did man on Christmas Eve we couldn't hardly go to sleep on 24th of December man we wanted to see Santa even though he was alive we didn't know that at the time I didn't realize that until I came to this church and realized man he was a phony oh my god I've been lied to all my life who ate them cookies we left for him I told my kids I ain't giving that man no credit for all the money I spent on y'all's gifts

cave Church I'm looking forward with excitement I'm not gonna open up a new package but I'll turn into a new body I'll be walking into Heatley I'm gonna be dancing on the other side I'm gonna be treading those streets to go it don't matter you make me kind of oh Hallelujah I'm here to worship my God I'm not looking at Tinsel I'm not looking at gift I'm looking at the giver face to face in a new body in a new land oh my God we got something to look forward to [Applause] he goes as you begin to see the days of your life drawing close then it begins to you begin to pack up closer getting ready for that great event he said it's now it's continuing of this same life notice it's continuing of this same life in another life not a big mansion over there your house is bigger my house your place is better than my place no it's not there but it's another he says now he's continuing of this same life in another world another place what we are here is what we're going to be there only in a Immortal body with Orlando all that gray won't be there no sister Gina those spring that you used to have when you used to play basketball when you was 18 it's going to be returned restored back what a God what a God and it took a profit it took a profit to prepare this body for restoration because if you go to the nominations they're not they don't believe this there's going to be trains planes and Automobiles crashing and people going I mean they got it all messed up but we have a Vindicated message that's doing what restoring us back for our change he says now things that are to be I want you to catch this things that are to be he says the bride in the Rapture will come forth that's things that are to be he says and there he is all and there is all pre-planned by God all backed up from the beginning he knowed every man every place who was sent all about it it's all pre-planned God knew it would be he made it that way and so when we get there he's going to prepare a place for us when we get there it'll all be prepared just even like this die he says this night is prepared like this hour is prepared yes his great for knowledge tells him all these things by foreknowledge things that are to be I'll go prepare a place for you take you out of this pest house and deliver you into my father's house oh my aren't you waiting for that some of you just get up in the mornings and you think about man look at this old past house you look in the mirror you think my mama so run down house I've been on a hunting trip for the last five days I'm gonna tell you it'll wear you out it's like all I did was sit but I sat so long I got tired of sitting I'll walk up them Hills and then mile you know you just this body can't handle it his body wasn't meant to handle it oh but when we get in that new body man we're going to get to the tallest hill on the other side we're going to look at look at him we're going to see all of eternity he said we made it we made it because God restored us back God had thoughts of us before the foundation of the world and what you are now you're only coming into that thought you're only being restored back to that thought of what God had of you you are not what you are now but you're going to be there you're going to be in a new body a new dwelling place with eternal Thoughts with eternal value what Eternal promises in an eternal God ruling and reigning with an eternal savior that's where we're headed Church he says I'll go to prepare a place for you and take you out of this pest house and deliver you into my father's house see there you are take you out of this old Earthly past house he's gone to prepare a place a perfect place where no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exists and no death exists things that are to be and the old people in the church says hallelujah come on old people it's okay if you're north of 50 brother Tim that means you Hallelujah it's okay Hallelujah that's where we're headed there'll be no pain there'll be no sickness there'll be none of these things no he says we're going to a new body he said it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection you have to be perfect to get there the Bible said Jesus said be you therefore perfect even as your father and Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand to be married to a perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect bride and you can't be perfect in your own ability as much as you try as hard as you try oh Church you can't do it on your own effort some of you that have been struggling with pornography you can't do it on your own efforts no you can lay it down for so long but if you hadn't been changed if your thought hadn't been changed and your nature hadn't been changed and your desires hadn't been changed you're gonna fall back to it but we've got a word that's going to restore us back so you don't think those old thoughts you don't have those old actions in those old desires but you begin to be renewed in your mind your mind begins to be restored your heart begins to be restored and the last thing that takes place is this body because in a full restoration and we step into a new body and then there'll be no dirty thoughts there'll be no uh evil thinking of anything like that you'll be thinking God's way in God's thoughts and believing God's promised word for that hour but he says now notice so how we're supposed to be perfect and brother Derek you can't do it on your own it takes a perfect god with the perfect message to come and make his people perfect and that's why we got to surrender our rights we're Lambs surrender your rights to do his will he goes now look it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people because you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect bride things that are to be so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sins he says that's right the blood of Jesus Christ think of it dripping bloody word amen the blood the word of God bleeding blood to wash the bride in she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place amen she was trapped into it now sometimes we can take this thought especially as a young person and think well I'm Justified but your desires hadn't changed yet just because you think well I still didn't even like Tabernacle I go to a message church and I believe God sent a prophet that I'm Justified it takes more than that justification means the things that you did you don't do them anymore you're declared Justified you never done it in the first place the old desires that you had to do it are no longer there you've got a new thinking a new mind a whole new nature and a new desires and he says now she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place so what brought us back to nomination didn't bring you to that place the Baptist Church didn't bring you to that thinking the Methodist Church didn't bring us to that thinking but the messes of the hour brought you back to that thinking Troy you realize that God's thought that he had of you in the beginning now you stand Justified now you stand now you stand predestinated of God to be back in the thoughts of God and these are things that are to be it's at the end of his roads when the last sermons that he preaches and he's telling us these are things that are coming there's going to be a bride and there's going to be a Rapture and all these things have to take place that has to be restored on this side that we can take that body change these are things that are to be not maybe not should be but these are things that will be there's a change coming from this body he said notice in Fellowship by Redemption sin separated Adam and Eve they went off in sin and and God had only one preparation for a sinful man to reach a holy God and that wasn't by self-righteousness it wasn't about patching up an old thing it was by the death and the resurrection the only way God condemned the man in the Garden of Eden because he had sinned in his whole body was full of mire and he says and never can you ever turn a new page you know people you can't turn a new page turn a new pages ain't come get the job done you know I tried turning new pages in my early Christian years it doesn't work some of you you try turning new pages you made decrees I'm not going to do it I'm not going to do it I'm not going to do it and sure enough because you hadn't been changed you did it you fell to it that's why we got to have a change and that change is only the first step of restoration God restoring you back and he starts in your mind to be renewed in your mind notice what he says he goes I don't care how much you join Church how many good things you do them as all fine you buy the Widow coal when she's cold you buy her food when she's hungry you take the little kids off the street that's good nothing to say light of that he goes but my brother sister you're a miserable being until that old Foundation is swept out the whole Foundation to swept out and you become a new creature in Christ Jesus in order for that Soul can be in contact with God for Fellowship you see he goes then when you get into that wonderful glorious Fellowship of his being all the little things just pass away and it seems all petty so childlike that's why we have trouble that's why we have professed Christians living just today they're all right tomorrow they're wrong the next day they're this he says it's because they never tore the old Foundation down Church's time to tear the old Foundation down it's time to sweep out the house and sweep out the foundation he says when he had when he had sinned God felt sorry for the poor fella see him and Eve going away without it going out there in Fellowship are going out of the fellowship they would have to shift for themselves what could they do they had a loving father who would take care of them but now through Disobedience cut off to a fellowship no more Fellowship they had to make a way for themselves they had to till the soul earn the living by a sweat of their brow they had to get sick and die in all kind of troubles and heartaches and disappointments why they severed the fellowship no more fellowship with God it couldn't be but God gave us a message I will restore Malachi 4 I'm going to restore you back to the faith of the fathers and when we restore back to that Faith we're stored back to the fellowship he says now that's where man stands today that's the reason you see them on the street working on Sunday that's why the reason you see them out going fishing and hunting on Sunday that's the reason you see them out there horse racing and automobile racing while you see them in the Poo rooms and Dives and so forth there is something in a man hungering for something that he can't find it see in this world can't produce it and the church can't produce it on mental theology they can't do it but a real child of God is hungering and thirsting why if there's something in your heart telling you that you want it and it needs in its needs there and he goes it just shows there's something pulsating trying to pull you there there's a body there that this one is a type of here he goes what are you using this one for to glorify the devil and the world and the fascisms and things are you looking towards heaven there's something up there if you're glorifying god with your life so notice why are you here this morning because there's something inside of you hungering there's something inside of you thirsting there's something pulling you into a new body that's why you're here the pastors away but you're here today why wasn't that oh you were coming to hear brother Joe no you brother Joe has nothing to do with it but there's something inside of you there's a desire inside of you that's pulling you to a new body and I'm here to tell you these are things that are to be but there's going to be a people she's going to be that pool is going to be so strong one day we're going to be pulled right on into it are you gonna step out of this old mortal flesh and you're going to step into a whole new body a well body of the liver body a body that don't think ugly thought but a body that thinks God thoughts then we're going to start traveling like a thought and that sounds really good right now notice but a real kind to God he's hungering and thirsting he says in my father's house are many mansions not us for no more because there's many mansions brother EJ one bald-headed about that tall kind of a mansion over there what was God done in the last three years in brother EJ's life restored him if I don't feel a very difficult time we thought his life was going to fall apart but God was processed of restoration because God has included brother EJ in the change and we see so many who has been added to the to the body here at the local body because one God is bringing a restoration see he says now in my father's house are many mansions if it wasn't so I would have told you I'll go to prepare a place for you and I come again to receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be awesome things that are to be these things that are now are only potential calling for the things that are to be oh my a real child of God hungering for a change a real child of God but each passing day this Mortal body deteriorates but they're longing this old Earthly Tabernacle that we have is groaning for something different it's groaning the Bible Will Tell Us in second Corinthians 5 and verse 1 for we know that at this Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God notice a house a Dwelling Place not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this sweet grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house it's your house oh my be close with your house that one that God thought of when God thought about having a family brother Derek he thought of you he thought he was going to be so tall so big so this so that nature this way and that way when God thought of it God thought of you in and yet our bodies are groaning to be cold with this house to be cold with this Dwelling Place see we've grown church and that's why we're here in church this morning we're groaning to get back into that body we're growing to live in the Eternal Realms we're groaning to take on a theophany body we want to be clothed not with somebody else's body not with somebody else's talks not with somebody else's ideas but code with their own theophany body so we can live as God wanted us to live from the beginning he says so now in verse 3 if so be that we're being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle we do grown being burdened not for that which we could not be uncloged but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life see man has to get man's got to tear down the old Foundation man's got to be regenerated and born again and come back to God and it's a process and it's called restoration and we're in that process and we're being restored we're not turning new pages you'll never do it it might be good he goes I have nothing against that good works that you do but that won't do it join the church won't do it taking your children to church won't do it until it becomes an individual affair it's got to be individual whether my wife makes it whether she doesn't make it it doesn't hinder me I have to to have that determination of my own we it has to be an individual Affair until you become back into Fellowship then we know we pass from Death unto life for our spirit Bears record with his spirit that we are Sons and Daughters of God and in the message of the invisible Union but prophet of God will tell us and any son is an attribute of his father now you look at my son good looking at me tip off the whole block well he's a big chip off a little bitty block over here tall he's trapping strong good looking putting the plug in for you son what we find to see any sun is an attribute of his father see there's things that we name and we may not look identical there's attributes in him that are in me there's attributes in my children that are in me and some of them are stronger than others are more prevalent than others but the prophet of God will say any son is the attribute of his father just as you were in the genes of your father in the body of your father when he was a young boy you were in him yet you cannot have fellowship with him because you didn't know him but through the bedding grounds of your mother you were brought forth into the Earth and becoming the image of your father then he could have fellowship with you and he says and we were and so were you sons of God and Daughters of God before there ever was a moon stars are molecule you were Sons and Daughters of God for you were only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God in the beginning he says there's only one form of eternal life and that was you wow there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before notice before you don't know nothing about it neither did you know when you was in your Earthly father but you were manifested too In His Image in the image of God all you made and you were manifested for the glory and The Fellowship Of God therefore as sure as the gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual Dean had to be in God because you are an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world and notice we come in corruptable bodies but the Bible says we were made in the image of God and if God is sinless and god is perfect and God is Immortal that ensures us that we're going back to that see God is not corruptable he's not sinful and therefore we must be restored back to that kind of life but that's why Satan is fighting us so hard Satan doesn't want you to leave his Eden look what he's offered you you can have anything you want in laodicea you can come to church you can stay home and stream and said you had church you can whatever you want to do you can come in and sit on the Pew in the great preaching and never move a word never be a participant always just sitting there be a spectator but never be a participator and I know some of that could offends some of you because your participal or your Spectators but God has designed more out of us than just spectating God is wanting to restore us back to the thoughts that he had in the beginning in that restoration job where was you Joe where was you when the sons of God shouted for Joy they weren't sitting there with their head down no but when the word was coming forth they were shouting and rejoicing over the word of God over realizing we've been restored back we come down through the fall we received the Vindicated word and that word changed our thoughts it changed our desires and now it's changing our bodies we're being restored back to that and one of these let me tell you that should excite you this morning that that's what God has called you to he didn't call you to live in laodicea he didn't call you to remain down here in the chicken yard but God has called you to fire to lift those Heavenly Wings and soar into the supernatural elements that's something to shout about well I don't shout stub your toe give me a hammer and let me put your hand your thumb on and we'll see if you shout or not I'm not trying to be ugly and be mean to be critical but come on God is restoring us this is something to be happy about it shall Exhilarate you well you say brother don't that's your message that's how God gave it to you no that's your message that's what God is given to you I'm only an instrument God put the thought in my heart to deliver to you this one to tell you you're being restored by for a change that change take place here your thinking has to change your worship has to change [Applause] your worship has to change not just in a song service that you stand and sing and open up your mouth but during the preaching of the word I like how brother Brandon said it that man criticized him because he got so loud he goes if I didn't know they if they didn't do that I wouldn't know they were getting anything out of it but what about our worship doesn't he deserve doesn't he deserve look what he's doing brother hell my Mississippi the armpit of America and he brought you here because you're part of the restoration sister Felicia he brought your family here because you're part of the restoration home what is God doing why did he bring you from Arizona why did he bring you from Washington God is doing a job he is through restoring of people he's restoring families oh come on somebody God is in the process of restoring and what he's doing here is only a tip of the hyper of what's going to happen on the other side that's going to be family it's going to be restored prodigal is going to be to restore homes are going to be restored Finance is going to be restored there's going to be a restoration take place in one morning we're gonna be goldters stop talking to that should excite you this morning that's under Rejoice about this one well I don't shout Brothers well you need to start shouting let it be a sacrifice of praise I know you like to sit down I know you don't want to work but I'm here to tell you this morning if you'll put something in it you'll get something out of it that's smart let's create an atmosphere that's Holy Ghost he comes down and changes he's just it changes that'll change you this morning and he'll change on the other side it's okay to worship it's okay to Rejoice it's okay to come to here it's okay to shout it's okay where are you going wherever you be like having that when I saw you shouting when I saw your rejoice when I saw your worshiping me there we are restoration the restoration of the Browns she's been restored back yeah it seems fine but he can't stop it he can't stop us he's fighting but he can't stop he can't stop your change we're going back to the original thought oh look he can't stop it listen with the prophet of God says see Satan don't want you to live a life of victory in these bodies he doesn't want you to live victorious in this body but let me just tell you where we're headed back to this is in the church hate he says that's the way the church is let me just skip down but if Divine ever the Vine come on Vine I'm not talking to vine this morning not some denomination I'll buy not some bad news Vine not some Raptor in the end Pentecostal by I'm talking about the porn again fine of Jesus Christ he said but if that vine ever brings forth another branch they gonna dance oh yeah they're gonna shout Glory Hallelujah They're Gonna Worship Praise by God in the way that they call heresy is the way that I serve my God you can look at me and call me a fool but I have a food for Jesus cause I know what he's done for me whoa buddy if they ever hit that vine ever brings forth another branch of itself that Branch will be exactly I said that by will be exactly like the first five what the first church was in Paul's day this church is going to be there she's going to be the same bone of his bone fresh of his friends power of his power she is him restored back to her virtue restore it back to Pentecost he will be the same kind of branch that was brought forth at Pentecost but what they do at Pentecost sat there no I'm sorry I got the wrong image of Pentecost now at Pentecost there were signs there was wonders Pentecost some of you know oh my some of y'all you knew how it was to get drunk I mean yeah hell you stumbled out then you out of that Ballroom you stumbled out walking all silly acting all silly didn't have a care in the world come on let me have the biggest man I'm ready to fight let me tell you that's what he's restoring us back to to Pentecost you don't care what somebody thinks about you you're here to worship you're going to serve God you don't care what's down with your faith ain't no matter how big he is my godfather I'll take you home because I know who I am I've got them the spirit and I've been received a change I received a word from my dog about the other has spoken to me oh yes sir I've heard from heaven and I know the change is all and in a moment in the tweaking of an alcohol flooring to God we're going to be Cancer all streets of gold we're gonna be speaking another come it's gonna be a hallelujah it's going to be a glorious day too forth another break you can't sit down French no don't break her license [Applause] it's got life today thank you I'll talk to you about a restored Church oh my oh my it will speak in tongues I know you need a prophet to tell you that those on the Stream there you have it it will speak in tongues prophesy and had the power of signs of the resurrected Jesus Christ in it why because it's thriving what are you here for cause you're thriving not only improve it not on Timothy Pruitt not on Aaron Oglesby or Joe Evans you're thriving notice you're thriving on the natural resource of the vine itself you're thriving on the life of the Vine if all you are is Baptist that's all you're ever going to be oh my because of your Baptist theology is only grafted in to the life that's being stirred right here that's why you don't stand that's why you don't shout that's why you don't Rejoice but you can ever get born into that vine and not graft it in oh you're a shout you'll sing praises your worship a living God [Applause] he says you see it wasn't grafted into the vine it was born in the Vine when those other branches were grafted he had all they could do was Bear their own fruit for what they were born of that vine they don't know nothing about the original life of the original Fruit see they cannot know it for they were not born of it but if they had been born of it that same life that was in the original stem Jesus would come through them and manifest through them John 14 12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me and the works that I do shall he do also see notice the Masterpiece now at the Harvest Time the seed is back to the original life back to the Bible Malachi 4 said it would be brought that way oh my church let me go look like a little bit further see Satan doesn't want you to be restored for your change he likes that critical spirit some of you come in with what we ain't got all that way my goodness could you see us acting that way what would they think on live stream what would they think on YouTube if they saw us all acting like brother Joe right now well they would think one thing were free but if you've ever been where I've been if you ever was hit it where I was headed I know that song we may sing it up but you don't know like I know what he done for me I know where I was hit I know where God I know what God had done for me I know the voice that came down and spoke to me in my car I know it was God it wasn't a man I didn't have no man to hold my hand lead me to Christ no I knew it was God that came down and done it I know what he'd done for me that's why I worship that's why I have no hope it doesn't bother me I don't care what you think I don't care what you think I don't care what you say I'm not here to worship you I'm here to worship God I'm in a worship my Lord I'm here to worship him I'll sing with everything I got I'll voice it would ever think I got I'll praise him with everything I got it don't matter cause you don't know I said you don't know like I know what it does for me all that day he said in the street I was headed to see in the devil's hell but I got that free person every day I was in prison all glory to God [Applause] but now I'm free you don't know like I know [Applause] what my God can do it's only it's only restoration this restoration restoration power is in the church this morning his Saints Can't Stop I say the Kingston he can't stop your change he can't stop he can't stop the restoration he can't stop the rapture he can't stop what he didn't start he didn't call you Satan didn't cognitive God calls before and if God called you God's going to finish God's gonna finish God started his church the way he wanted it and now he's going to have his church the way he started it notice Satan can't stop in Matthew 16. and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon son of Jonah flesh and blood has not revealed this unto thee but my father but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock This Revelation I'm going to build my church and the gates of hell can't stop it Satan can't stop it cancer can't stop it politics can't stop it War can't stop it Seekers can't stop I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna have a church and she's gonna be without a spot and she's going to be without women she's going to be when I see it why because Satan can't stop but God started he says let me tell you something brother listen to this and I say this respect hallelujah oh hell can't stop it all hell can't stop it stop what the restoration the restoration of what the bride tree see God has built his church he started his church and now he's going to have his church the way he planted it in Ephesians you may not like the way the church is today but if you can only go back to Ephesus and see how Paul's church was oh brother Orlando they had freedom in Paul's Church Paul preached one night all night somebody felt dead they didn't give up they went down to laid hands on them brought them back and they finished service what are you saying brother Joe you're going to preach long I don't know but I'm here to tell you the bride that was in the beginning is going to be the same bride today we've already been seen in a vision think about a pro God let a prophet see the bride in preview oh when she came in preview she was a glorious Church a wonderful church had worship my she was she was just a beautiful a beautiful article of worship of what God's creation and then you see what man's Church brought down the Church of this in Asia and this one and that one and then you see the American Church so we saw what the church was in Paul's day then we see what happened in laodicea and we see the church that man created coming to the tune of rock and roll but the spirit of God will say no the bride is going to come in preview one more time one more time and he said what she was in this one is exactly what she was in that one what was it a restored Church same power same word same everything church that's where we're headed same message but see the prophet of God said that church that bride had to be planted had to go into the ground so it could come up through the ages and produce what we have today just like Christ had to go into the ground see hell can't stop a cancer can't stop and none of these things can stop him he goes we got to have a message sweep back and bring the people out all these denominational conditions back to the original genuine Pentecostal faith he's going to bring forth a little bride this is in the masterpiece so that's right that's smitten right back to the side of the original word and there he is there is the Masterpiece the family back together again in the Garden of Eden the family or stores though ages separated oh but he's going to restore that church right back oh my notice what he says now God is going to have a virtuous church just exactly a bride in Ephesians 5 and 27 he's going to present to himself a glorious church not having spot wrinkle or any such thing but that should be holy without blemish and we find that word present means to stand by the bring near he's gonna bring a brand near him and not only is she going to be brought near but she's going to worship with him she's going to rule with him she's going to reign with him because why she is bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she is him you talking about A Change of Atmosphere why are we having convention style services on Wednesday nights and on Sundays with our normal people do you feel Restoration in the air so you feel change in the air do you feel the atmosphere changing some of you oh my let that atmosphere get a hold of you I had to get a hold of you maybe a little bit starchy that's okay loosen yourself up a little bit let the atmosphere get a hold of you I know you got a human nature you don't like some of this but that's okay you let the atmosphere just get a hold of it get caught up in it I promise you ever go to a sporting event you you don't sit there and just like all soured up no you paid money you know how much it cost to get into college football game these days I don't know I don't go if I just imagine let's just say you got good tickets let's just say Tennessee and Alabama's playing I'm a Tennessee guy they're playing tickets on the sideline where fifteen hundred dollars a seat I'll tell you what if I paid that kind of money I'm gonna have a good time I mean a real good time I'm about to run down there and say coach let me call a play no you put that much time in it you saved your hard on money and you went to that sporting event you didn't just go and sit down I was what are they shouting for what happened what did they just do did they score a touchdown did they get a first what you mean a first down second down what's all these Downs about no you know what's going on you know what's taking place you're on the sidelines come on team come on team and when you come to the house of God let me tell you if you know the cost the price that he paid so that you can send that seat you should come with some excitement you should go all highly freaking brother Joe preach it preach it preach it preach it yes sir you got the devil on the run you preaching brother we're gonna be tagged we're gonna be restored put something in it you'll get something out of it there's an atmosphere a change in the roof restoration has taken place God is restoring the church he says we have the answer to the devil's question oh yes sir don't you worry God's gonna do it he's going to do it he's going to have that church notice here once more don't you worry she is going to be there she is going to be there there'll be people there you didn't think would be there oh my I can't wait to see who made it I can't wait because see I'm not putting them in and I'm not taking them out God puts them in and God keeps them out oh but he said don't you worry she's going to be there just make sure you're part of the restoration make sure you're part of the change see the holy spirit will be moving so in the church to the church in Christ will be the same spirit oh we had the answer God has Vindicated himself God has proved himself to his promise in this day Hallelujah the headship is here Christ the Risen Lord is here in the same power of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself there's the devil's answer it ain't you fighting this battle by yourself the headship is here the headship in the body has become one unit oh my see the home the husband and wife are to be one unit kids come to mama mom I want to do this now then they run to Daddy if Daddy said something different that's not one unit but when Daddy says I said what's your mama say why you always gotta ask what mama said because we one unit and what mama said papa says and when Papa said Mama says the headship is here and what the what the heck the bride from the head is saying so is the pride saying it and what does he saying restoration is in in the future Church we're going to be restored for a change and it may just take it the headship is here we had the answer to the devil's question he can't stop you he can't stop this word he can't stop this change he can't stop the supernatural he can't stop your healing he can't stop your deliverance he can't stop us we're an invincible Army we're an unruly forced when it comes to hell all right it's a headship in the body has become one unit it's God manifesting in his people that's the reason the husband and wife is no longer Twain but they've come one notice I'm gonna go just a little bit further I know I preached him only an hour last time and y'all were all excited for those preaching again I might keep it a little longer today I'm feeling inspired notice now he says we stand justified in Christ before him because he cannot pass judgment he's already judged that body in which I'm part of oh my some of you should have shouted amen real loud right there man you know you got things in your life and you felt crummy all week oh but he's already judged that body I said he's already judged that body he's already declared you perfect there you are there's the body of Christ Living standing redeemed justified in his sight this is Christ and Mr God revealed why are we Justified we are his victory well I don't feel like nobody's Victory about Joe you are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in the last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we're a proof of his victory notice now when we see him coming down living among the church that's his victory shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave and he can't keep us in the grave while our church is having the services we have because we're proof of his victory was a holy ghost Freedom move in this church because we're proof of his victory God is going to have a pride and that bride is giving herself to her bride group and she's not holding anything back she's not critical of the spirit she's not selfish in her own makeup no whatever he wants she does she has thus saith the Lord or she keeps still that's the word of God for this hour and I say little brother let yourself go to the Lord let yourself be free to worship cause what she is he is and what he is she is he says we're bound right we're already potentially erased because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denominational increase to the Eternal Word Eternal God which is him himself working through US manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever Church you are proof of his victory through all your ups and downs your proof of his victory through all your failures and your mistakes you're still proof of his victory you are here this morning showing that you are proof of his victory you are here see the scars that you have on your life the family strange that's passed down well you should have quit a long time ago you are here this morning declared that I am proof family strange can't keep me down stars can't keep me down failures can't keep me down mistakes won't keep me I have proof this money that he's alive because well I have proof of his victory he came down and he changed me he changed my thoughts and one day Church there's gonna be another change take place I'm proof you're proof we are proof that this word works where is Victory this morning she's bearing his name displaying his character manifesting his word with signs and wonders now as I bring this down to a close I'll stop with this I didn't say I was stopping I said I will stop with this that means I'm gonna carry on comma and today there is a bride tree it started back there at the beginning way back at the day of Pentecost oh you got to go back to Pentecost again well that's where it was planted check your spirit if you don't like Pentecost maybe you got planted in the wrong place maybe you're still playing in a dominational tree maybe you just graft it in I'm talking about Pentecost we have freedom in Pentecost oh my I wish I had a time machine I'll travel back there I'll give Paul a good amen come on Amen Church man you could travel back and hear Paul preach and that's all you can do Mercy oh my man first church age mission is set in a church in order that's something to shout about he said the church never started and I see Romans started in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost the day of Pentecost not the denomination but the spirit of Pentecost the power of God then what did they do they just kept organizing keep cutting it off the branches then they organized the Lutheran cut off the branches Wesley cut off the branches Pentecost they cut off the branches until it come notice every age they just cut more off and cut more off and cut more off until you finally get down to the layout of cnh there's nothing left but a stump oh my can I stop right here is that good enough or do you want me to finish notice what he says turn your Bibles job 2 verse 21. he says fear not old land and be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things I said the Lord will do great things and the people that know that God they're gonna do exploits they're the people will do exploits they're going to do great things it ain't just for the Lord but it's for the Lord's people as somebody in the land today brother there has two in marvelous things great things unbelievable things The Impossible is become possible the reality of the word has been made manifest he said fear not on land and be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things let me tell you restoration is a great thing Oh my he says Be not Afraid you beast of the field for the pastors of the Wilderness do spring for the tree bearth her fruit and the Fig Tree and the vine do yield their strength believe God then you children of Zion rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former aim moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat oh my oh my God full of wheat oh what a harvest season we're not going to be hinting we're not going to be Barren but we're going to be full of we we're going to be full of the supernatural power of God come on even like Tabernacle you might as well get ready oh the days of the famine is over he's gonna give you the form of rain and the latter rain and we're going to be the fact that the they can't contain what's about to be poured out we're gonna be full of wheat oh and the fish shall overflow with one and all oh what oh the fats all overflow with stimulation of Revelation and the pooper out of the supernatural element of the Holy Ghost whine and all I'll tell you what you don't like stimulation you may want to leave [Applause] we're about to have an overflowing the light I say we're about to happen overflow that's gonna be weak there's a tablespread there's a milk a pie and there's a spirit and the wild glory to God that's gonna be a supernatural why just God he's about to restore I said he's about to restore verse 25. he says and I will restore to you all the years I've been restored to you the years that the locusts has eaten that can't worm the caterpillar upon more migrate Army which I sent among Satan has done his best you can be seated Satan has done his best to keep this bride tree from coming forth he doesn't want her to reach her potential to recognize her full power and her Authority and the jurisdiction that she has over him he doesn't want her to step into that restore new body but he can't stop it because God is going to do great things come on Church great things oh my it's harvest season sister Loretta great things man the fats are full of oil and wine notice he says now what does the Locust do the Locust eats off the lead that's right the Locust takes onto the leaves he cut off the fellowship off that's right took all the fellowship what is fellowship what did the leaves do make it cool well the birds fly under the leaves oh cool off there your tree again he says there's your tree again he shall be like a tree that's planted oh wow there's people that can come and sit down under the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit and cool off a little bit you're all frustrated and don't know what's happening whether you die whether you're saved or not you don't know whether the church is right or this is right you just come under that tree that got some leaves on it what are we doing at evening light Tabernacle oh we're growing out leaves brother Brown brother Tim keeps preaching about a big oak tree quit fighting against it let's be a big oak tree where it's cool the leaves have been restored back oh my I'm gonna restore the leaves back to my Brier tree she's going to be a big oak tree again where others can come and have fellowship and relax and take in a wonderful service and be stimulated cool off not worrying about this and worried about that notice I'm going to restore to you all the years at the Locust but not only the Locust he's not going to just stop there and give you a partial restoration but I'm going to restore it to you what the canker worm what did the canker worm do he goes into the bar that's the lifeline there yes sir he goes into the bark and it destroys the covering of the tree the religion see the cakeworm after he's got among the congregation got them all dignified some of y'all cankers need to get out of here oh don't be calling us names brother Joe I'm just telling you if you identify with this you can change he's a notice the canker worm we got amongst all the congregation got them all dignified then he took all the fellowship away from in the form of the locus and now he comes around he takes their very religion and make dogmas out of it and sets an unorthodox words forms himself a religion gets a bunch of men together and put down a Creed there he takes a very religious strips it off the god tree the very bark that bears the South that comes up and takes it away and now there's no more now there's no life in the church there's no prayer lines in the church there's no altar calls in the church it's only intellectual idea what happened they had stripped a bark off the tree but he said I'm going to restore True Religion I'm going to restore true worship to my Bright Tree it'll no longer just be an intellectual understanding but she's going to have the very life flowing through her again see I'll send the prophet down with anointed word and he would turn to heart away from man's ideas man's Creeds man's dogmas and turn her back to the original Faith back to the original word notice then he says end the caterpillar see what is the caterpillar he's a sucker he sucks the life the spirit I the spirit the life that's what he does he gets down and he holds the pulp and he goes to sucking the caterpillar here he is who who's going to call him a denomination or he says who are going to call him a denomination that's that guy right that's his name why he's a good story he sucks the life out of it but he have a promise I'm going to restore back the life to my church it's not

heart one Accord we bought the supernatural and look I will pull the gloves off we're gonna go we're gonna have the spirit of God it's gonna be free to move here I look at what other churches have done I see dead churches out there and I see a live church out there I don't want to be a morgue we ain't putting dead bodies in the grave we're putting we're about to have a change of the body he says now look notice now some of these embalming fluids so-called dodging Creeds pumped into their veins where the spirit of God ought to be their running where the old church Creed pumped in there no wonder they're so icy and cold and dead spiritual thermometer 90 below zero yeah somebody say Amen now everybody stretch their neck around like some Goose or something want to know what it said it's a shame when the spirit of God ought to be Joy peace love but this little old bug started eating on it I don't like the way they run around church I can't believe brother Joe just took off did you see

would never restored by them he's going to grow it right up out of the stump I will restore saith the Lord it won't come out of any Creed it won't but it will come out of God I will store these Palmer worms the canker worms and so forth that eat the God's heritages has eat down the stump but I will not come through these neither will I use them he will come right from the stump right up with it I will restore he's going to restore the faith in the people the musicians if you would come Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever when the Fig Tree puts forth its Buzz there she is the nation with their own money everything else currency own Army everything first time for 2500 years Jesus said when you see putting forth them butts forth we're at the end time we see the coldness of the church we see the denomination of growing when you see the Fig Tree and all these other trees budding forth their Buzz Jews returning the Fig Tree Jews returning to their Nation their own country he says get ready that's the time when we see that the coming to pass that's when God is fixing to call the elect in church we have seen Israel back in our homeland since 1948 she's had her own money find her own flag how's our own military one of the greatest militaries in the world today and leads Nations and technological advances and if that's that tree the Fig Tree what about the bright tree the natural type in the spiritual the Church of God knows them what he says beginning in any of the Gentile dispensations the Church of God is putting forth buds the Church of God she's blooming out into her power again the Palm worm eat part of it they can't worm eat part of the hookworm eat part of it the caterpillar eat part of it but God said it will live again she is putting forth buds now that's what's happening the restoration of our change God sent the Holy Ghost the life of God to be in you not in a statue but you are the god that God wants to live in he will restore back church just play something sister lauriana if he would he says we know that we can only build a church first upon the material that God gave us to build it with that's all we have he goes I know this is strong it's going to take hundreds of people around the world we're here but before we can ever have a building of the Church of God we will have to restore back all the things that these insects has eaten out of we'd have to go back and find out what the insects eat and before the vine of the Lord the Grapevine he's Divine we are the branches and before he can ever find out or the church can stand in a formal in its formal and original Power we'll have to go back and find out what these insects ain't and that church will have to be restored back to that or it will never stand in the power and Glory of its first standing if the bark is tore off the tree we got to get back to the bark again on it grow back to Bart first you can't have apples till you grow the Bark for the bark is the sap line the sap is in the life of the line the scripture is the holy he said God's holy Bible is the lifeline of the church how could we ever bring in a great sap through a sycamore's bark you just won't work we got to have Grapevine bark we've got to have the original bark there's only one way that that bar can ever come back on the vine that's when God grows it himself we can't make some put on won't work he said it won't work no man's scheme will ever work it'll take God's way or it'll never live man-made schemes will not work he might wrap a rag around the tree and say Let It Grow the rag wasn't God's program it's got a bark on a Lifeline when it comes from the roots it'll produce the same life that was in the tree he says I will no wonder one will say oh this and know that and
