something to praise him about and we're thankful we can go to him with every need and he hears in the answers let's go to him together in prayer amen there's some great needs this morning but we serve a great god no matter what the need is no matter what the fear that the devil would try to attach to that need the god that we serve is not only bigger but he's greater and i believe that that same god is present with us this morning he's here right here in this building and if we can be like that lady just reach out and touch to him and miss garment you'll find that he's the same god otherwise the bible wouldn't tell us that he's the same yesterday today and he'll be the same for us tomorrow so we got some great needs but we serve a great big god let's just take these needs before him in prayer take your need and trust and believe don't pray half-heartedly but pray believing that god is going to meet that need the god that we serve is here he's manifested himself time and time again father how we thank you this morning lord we hear the reports many that are suffering in our bodies lord sickness is on the rampage and covetous lord seem like it's off the leash and has taken many of the believers from this dimension to the next but father we know that's only a portal by which you chose to use a call of believer home and we're just asking father that those that were left behind the family members of friends the churches that those lives impacted you would comfort them lord today and tomorrow in the many days ahead as lord as they greed the lost of their loved one but lord as i read the account of jude murray's sister elizabeth murray's sister lord and how she stayed the course and never denied the faith no matter what the hand that was the dealt her father she remained faithful to the call and no doubt many of these other believers as well lord as they would cross this dimension to the other they they remained steadfast because they had met the god of yesterday and he was the god for them today and you're going to be the god for those left behind tomorrow so father i'm asking today that there be a mighty move of the spirit of god not only and even like tabernacle but across the world where the gospel is being ministered lord may the healing hand just begin to sweep over the body lord lord you're the one who formed and who fashioned the very intricate details of our bodies you know how each and every one operate and how this part moves in conjunction with this part and god we believe you're here today to be not only our our great physician but our healer our deliverer our provider and we pray for these needs dear god and we're asking for the hand of god to come down and administer healing to those that need that touch god you see our pastor in the back office and the need in his body we believe you to be a great big god this morning that can go back there into the room father and begin to administer healing to that body lord you know how you performed it and how you operate and how you put it together and i'm asking for the great physician to come by this morning i'm asking for the one that knows the very details of our lives to come by and touch every request lord every hand that was lifted to you this morning father it may have not been a physical need maybe it's a spiritual need but you're still god you still heal lord you still mend the brokenhearted you still save the loss and lord i'm asking this morning that you'll turn your spirit loose upon the bride of christ this morning that we can see you in a whole new way father may our eyes become open to this lord to the rim of the supernatural this morning father may you just come in our midst this morning father and just make yourself visible among us lord you tell us in your word that you didn't leave us comfortless but you sent us another comforter you provided us the holy spirit in this hour lord knowing that lord at the last days it would be a wicked time and there would be a people that would need lord they would need that assurance they would need that the holy spirit to get through this trying time and i believe you're here this morning lord i believe you're not only here to heal but i'm here to believe that you're going to feel those that are in need of the holy spirit i believe you the same yesterday you're the same today father you're the same tomorrow god and if you came in an upper room some 2000 years ago i believe you're god today and you'll come in this upper room or the upper room of our hearts today lord to take care of our young people you know their struggles god but i believe you're here to feel for the older folks god i believe you're here to deliver them this morning and feel what the holy ghost i believe you're here to move lord god i believe you're here to show yourself faithful to those that reach out and touch to him in your garment for whatever need for whatever request from whatever circumstance i believe you're still god and i'm asking lord for a mighty move of the spirit a mighty display of your word this morning father lord many times as i i just recall last week father brother tim brought out it's not just in signs and wonders put us in the preaching of the gospel it's the same gospel and if it's preached the same way then it has to bring the same effects it breaks the bonds lord god of the enemy that would hold a believer down it looses the shackles lord god of the captive it lets him go out and realize there is freedom in christ so god we don't preach an intellectual gospel preach a gospel that is backed by the the holy spirit is backed by heaven and we just ask this morning god use our pastor use the song service brother mike as he will lead us in worship god lord may we just let go of our own humanity and just let ourselves lord be loosed in the spirit to worship you this morning for what you have done for us can't we just give you a little bit of worship this

every single one of them had been answered amen brother branham said one time the prayers of the saints grandparents that may have gone on years ago are still being answered today amen i believe that

today to know we're part of the redeemed body of jesus christ called according to his purpose i'm so glad he's got a purpose he's got a purpose in everything about our lives otherwise he would be the author of frustration and not a peace but he's got a purpose he's got a plan we just want to find that plan for our lives and walk in that amen let's talk to the lord today perhaps you have a burden upon your heart and need and you just need to say lord i i need you to pass by my way would you just come to my pew today and speak to me in a special way i i need to hear from you he can do it maybe a still small voice it may be something that is said the need that you have just pulls the gift of god to minister to you personally speak to your need but he's god he's got a way to talk to you he wants to reveal himself let him do it to you father we love you today and we thank you for your blessings to us your grace is always sufficient as always always you're the provider even though lord in this life we receive blow after blow as long as we're mortal it'll happen sickness will come troubles will come we're not exempt from them but lord we have a savior and a healer and a deliverer and we're looking to you today lord that you'll just reveal your purpose in our lives or whatever it is the needs that are there to speak lord i'm i'm just as helpless as i can be without you i can do nothing but lord i just prayed today that you would anoint me and anoint the 90s lips to speak the word of life let me find that vein that avenue of anointing let me not minister just by intellectual reason in the flesh but by the working of the holy spirit pray for brother timothy way up in northern arkansas today brother jason jackson's i pray you'll use him lord as he ministers now and every neither your people god we hear these requests some dying with kobe some close to be putting on ventilators lord some have already died and their loved ones are are suffering oh god i'm wondering why why why has why has this happened i pray oh god that you'll just comfort them and that's the only way you can in the manner only you can do father we know we're here in the great hour and it's the last days and we've seen fulfillment of your word lord it's happening all around us even the things that we hear in the news and the calamities that are happening is all fulfillment a prophecy that spoke of this last day we're walking in the vision lord we're the one now with the green checkered shirt on and realizing that waking up to the reality we're we're in the vision we're walking right there in the very path of god i pray today that you'll speak now speak to the hearts speak to those lord that are that are needed an answer from you lord that their hearts are maybe today troubled troubled in their spirit may it be today you minister to them in a great way they're those lord that are in the valley of the seasons and this decision can cause them trouble for their lifetime i pray lord that you would help them to make the right decision lord we want to be in the path of your will because it's there we're blessed we get out of that and the permissive will and that's there we lose the blessings of god until we come back to your perfect will i pray lord that you'll bless your people now speak to them speak to us to the word blessed to our hearts heal your people and comfort them strengthen us now in jesus name amen amen god bless you it's good to be in the house of the lord amen and be in his presence today and we just want to say we are welcome we're glad to see each one of you that is assembled with us praying that god will speak to you in a very very special way today i want just to remind you we have our meetings that are coming up and there is um brother daryl was telling me a little meeting after the church for the ladies there to kind of in preparation for that is you know we try to provide some sack lunches and things for the people knowing that there's not a lot of restaurants to go especially when we have church because uh we get out kind of late sometimes and so um rather than sending the people away hungry well we try to provide a little something so they'll be talking about that and and uh got to brother ron spencer brother donnie reagan brother wayne lawson going to come for those just the weekend before that but the david mayer will be here from switzerland and minister to us again and you'll be blessed by that and so we have some wonderful things that just lay right ahead for us in the month of october and a lot of things to look forward to amen and uh well all of his goodness ain't laying the next month we still got some in this amen and even for today amen revelation chapter 3 verse 14 we're going to turn to the scripture to the very place where we are at today now i want you to remember when when we read about the church ages when god would um address each age jesus would address both the true and the false vine so you know in in there when you say well i'm i'm not a laodicean well that is true in the sense that we're not the lukewarm former former powerless uh ones that that are have been christ rejectors but we are those ones that have received i salve and from the seventh angel's message and uh we the shame of our nakedness has been covered by the robe of his righteousness and you know um all of the all of the things and we are the ones that have been granted to sit with him and on his throne so we're here in this fulfillment of scripture today and we're going to look at this together as he addressed both the true and the false vine and so revelation 3 14 and to the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things sayeth the amen this is going to be the final say god's going to put an amen on all the other messages down to the ages and so this is his final voice that will come to the final age these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness and we would see god do that time after time when when he would put an amen to a prophet when he'd bring a message and then he would be a faithful and true witness telling exactly who they were where they come from everything with a way with very detailed um insight into their lives is a word discern the thoughts in the intents of the heart so he's a faithful and true witness and the beginning of the creation of god and so as we this is of course the revelation of deity because he is the beginner of a new creation i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that thou were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because i says i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and no not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes out that thou may see as many as i love sounds like he's going to love somebody in this age amen so it's not just to the false vine that he is speaking to as many as i love i rebuke and chasten and then he gives an admonition be zealous therefore and repent this is very very important because you must have the ability to repent every time that you're faced with the word you must change your mind no matter what you think about things no matter what the world is saying about it you have to change your mind and and have a complete a complete mind change a paradigm shift amen to take what the word says over what you even believe to be the truth even what you see or hear around you that is supposed to be the truth you take what the word said now notice i i be zealous therefore and repent this is my attitude every time i listen to a tape every time i read a book every time i read a scripture this is my attitude i i'm looking at that not to change the word but to be changed by the word now behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh so there's going to be somebody overcome the laodicean lukewarm spirit christ rejecting spirit to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am sat down with my father in his strong and then he tells us somebody's going to hear what the spirit said it's not going to be a message not going to come and it'd be in vain somebody's going to hear it so he that an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen may god bless you as you're seated today i'm going to be laying some foundation in order to get to the thought that i want to bring but i'm going to be working toward this thought as we minister today on behold the word bride now so you know behold the word bright in other words even as he said behold the lamb of god to take away the sin of the world we're wanting now to look and see the form that christ is in today now there's a meeting in the air and we're not doing away without that's what believers believe we'll meet a physical lord jesus amen and we will meet him in the air that's what believers believe oh no the world won't see it or you know they won't see the saint of dead when they come forth they won't see this disappear and this is something only the elect will see will be caught up to meet him in the air now after that we'll come back with him after the three and a half years of of the great tribulation here upon the earth and the marriage supper in the of the lamb in heaven we'll come back with him this is revelation 19 where that will return with him and there ever i will see him and every tongue will confess but you see you know as the church world 2000 years ago they were looking for the wrong coming and it blinded them as to what god was doing so it's very important that you keep your mind and your eyes and know what god is doing in our generation now this scripture that we have read defines our age well it foretells the condition of the last day church who is rich has got lots of goods but as at the same time as lukewarm unto unenthusiastic indifferent cool half-hearted lackadaisical unconcerned apathetic tepid uninterested impassive dispassionate emotionless passionless limp noncommittal unresponsive unmoved laid back and couldn't care less that's all what lukewarm means and this is a condition of the last day church now so and it's in it's her attitude toward the word of god and toward the spirit now when we say word we're not we want you to understand the word is not a book the word the word is not something even on tape the word is a person so therefore worship has to be in spirit and in truth it's not just word only or or knowledge only or intellectualism but it is in spirit as well so that is that again is the person so when we're talking about a word bride we're not talking about one that just simply is is a walking bible that just um quoting quotes and and and knows it has a bunch of knowledge we're talking about the the person of jesus christ manifested in a people now now as we look at the condition of this last day church who couldn't care less is unmoved laid back non-committal emotionless um impassive unconcerned half-hearted and you know he cannot let me just say it he cannot take this church for a bride she refuses to be washed by the water of the word she says i have needed nothing even her attitude toward god is you know i'm self-sufficient i've got what i need and god i don't need you now she you know so that's her assessment of herself so but he his assessment of her is that she is wretched miserable poor blind and naked in other words she is repulsive to him therefore she actually jesus until she is spewed out of his mouth now what does that mean you know um there there again what does it mean to be the mouth of god you know what does it mean to be in his mouth they in other words in the past the baptist the methodists the pentecostals the denominations they have spoke for him in their time but they will no longer this church will no longer be the voice that speaks for god because of their lukewarmness they are spewed out of the mouth of god meaning they are no longer the instrument that he speaks through as brother branham said in the laodicean church age in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word and the lutheran spoke for god at that time and they organized and again the pure word was lost for organizational tens toward dogma and creeds and not simple word and they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day and the people who took his revelation from god um became living epistles read and known of all men for their generation and when the methodist failed god raised up others and so has it gone on through the years what's now until this one this last day there is another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age god's still going to have a voice no matter whether the church has rejected him no matter whether their church has failed him no matter whether church has been is now repulsive to him to they're no longer his voice god will have a voice in this end time who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age now because of the rejection of the voice of god or the word of god that has opened up the book to us understand it had to be first rejected by the denominational system in order for god to call a bride out from among them so you see the the denominations were judged and rejected just like vasta in the book of esther the church has had her own feast to which god is not wanted nor invited and this is the problem that we are seeing today across the land even in many message churches god isn't wanted and he isn't invited they don't want his holy spirit they don't want his gifts they don't want his miracles they don't want anything but their little creeds and their dogmas of man and some little hierarchy you know some self-made pope sitting standing in the pulpit somewhere with a personality cult fallen but god says that nauseates him they become lukewarm formal and cold and powerless this is something that we should be praying all the time god whatever don't let me get in that laxadaisical lukewarm unconcerned condition let me be one thing on fire for god as brother branham would say and i quote him he said this bride by no means will be a layover to see she will be on fire for god amen and i'll tell you if you don't have a fire it's time for you to get your fire lit you know i was just hearing today about a revival that has been going on in uganda and they have been baptizing tens of thousands who are now embracing the message and and of course there is signs and wonders and even the dead has been raised among them great things has happened but i i i just want to just say even though we rejoice in many being baptized that's only the first step amen oh god don't let them stop there let the let the ugandans and all the world say i've been baptized and i believed on the lord and i received his word but i've got to receive him i've got to have the person of the holy ghost in my life that ought to be the ring and that is ringing out an evening like tabernacle today i've been baptized i've been taken on his name i've embraced the message but i gotta have him in my life that personal experience the baptism of the holy ghost that puts a fire on the inside of me that trials can put out amen the troubles can't put out amen that that that the rejecters cannot put a cold blanket on amen but something that causes me to have a passion for god and a passion for his word amen now brother brethren would tell us in the indictment he said that christ is god's provided lamb notice how appropriate was showing that jerusalem was ceasing now we're going to be doing some comparing here in a moment ago with the last could we call it church age or the last church group there in jesus day and then this last age that we're in because both of them are christ's rejecters both of them are christ rejected like i said people are worried about covet vaccine that ain't the thing to worry about the thing to worry about is getting that seal of god in your life to turn down the seal of god is to take the mark of the beast i'm more concerned about people being cold and formal and powerless without a passion without a zeal in my way there's no response to the word the dead is 12 o'clock midnight their experiences something that happened 15 20 years ago and their musk back like an old turtle there that you know just been in there so long until mosses growed all over him they ain't moved in years i'm telling you they're in backslidden condition that's not a rapture-ready church amen a church that is going in a rapture is a people that on fire for god they got a passion they got a zeal to know the truth to change their lives together they're zealous to repent now crisis he said it was that he talks about how appropriate was showing now that jerusalem was ceased now we've got to every denomination has made their own group the jerusalem here's where everybody's got to come due to worship every one of these little cultists movements in the message they make their own little group the jerusalem and jerusalem he said was ceasing when it was effect it was in effect until that hour the blood of the lamb was that's the woolly lamb was all right until that day but now at the crucifixion it changes the old system is done there was a new one and the lamb was at the sacrifice the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds and they were condemning and doing the very things there that they had to do that's right and he says god be blessed for seeing this wonderful heavenly light in this last day because the churches is doing the same thing until the hour that organization religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing christ's words and from then on comes the word and the word only not a philosophy not our intellectual learning so where amen the word and the word only from that old paschal lamb passed away and that christ become our lamb at the day of crucifixion and today that denominations crucified the word of god and accepted a creed instead of the word of god that's the day the word come into full effect and he says that's just been done recently and of course you know that was all because it opened up the seven seals now the rejection of the church was necessary for a bride to be called out from among them again the rejection of vasti you know was necessary for esther to come on the scene now before a kingdom before a new kingdom can come in the religious system of the day has to be terminated in other words you know god can't deal with both of them so you know before another kingdom can come in where god is a king and he has the preeminence then the religious systems of the day has to be terminated the coming of the kingdom terminates the religious systems of that day now remember what is the kingdom it is not meat and drink right amen but but what is it it's the holy ghost that's exactly what the kingdom of god is it is the holy ghost so the coming again of the holy ghost pouring out of the spirit in this last days to make this a wheat seed mature grain bride amen it comes into to and it terminates it brings a termination to the religious systems of the day just think about it before a president can come in there has to be an ending or going out of the form of administration amen now jesus foretold the ending of the of the of that present kingdom of israel when he was there he would tell them exactly your kingdom this kingdom is coming to an end your system of worship is coming to an end the whole thing you say right now to the woman at the well he said right now he said all men go to worship at jerusalem amen this is where you're to worship but he said that time is coming and now is that day that worship the father must worship him in what spirit and truth so so again he was telling them there was even a new order of worship and that the old worship and the old lamb and the old way of doing thing and the old place to find the mercy would now be changed the other made obsolete now if you'll turn with me to matthew 23 37 he would look at jerusalem now jerusalem represents it's there where the temple is and it's representing now the very headquarters are very the the very headquarters of that religion and he says oh jerusalem jerusalem thou that kill us the prophets stone us them which are sin unto thee how often would i have gathered my thy children together even as a hand gathered their chickens and their wings and you would not behold your house is left unto you desolate for i say to you you will not see me henceforth till you shall see blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord so here he is saying you israel you know there is a change that is happening and you i'm coming to your house and you'll not see me no more until until you will till i come with ten thousands of the saints and you will look on him to in revelation was it one eighth where that look upon him that thou is pierce and mourn is one as mourning for his only son so now from on now on comes blindness and the darkness begins to hover over the temple of god and jesus is declaring you are rejected for you israel your light has turned to darkness the veil was rent showing god wasn't there come on there was no pillar of fire there no shekinah glory there god had left the system and there he was the new lamb the true lamb hanging on a cross the one they had rejected now i wonder how many churches including some message churches or houses left desolate now when jesus leaves this temple he comes he departs from there to return no more let me tell you when god leaves a place that's serious when god leaves a home amen come on now when god leaves a marriage some people don't want god in their marriage amen yeah yeah you know a lot of times we have a man wanting the woman to be subjected to him but what about him being subjected to the word what about him be a real example of a real christian and a real leader in the home and a real father [Applause] come on amen you know but when god leaves a home that house is left desolate when god leaves a church that church is left desolate so that's why it's important that god never leaves us amen we should everyone strive to ever serve us get in the spirit amen uh preaching is no good it is even is it even it is not even preaching without the spirit the anointing has to be there a lot of people think you know that they can they can just get up and and talk a little sermon and give a little thought and that's preaching that ain't preaching amen it takes the anointing of god to preach and that's not a intellectual you say well it ain't screaming and shouting well i'll tell you what it ain't in lectures either sure i've seen men screaming shouting not a lick of anointing but i've seen i've seen too much of this in this day just getting up with a formal talk never get in the spirit of god never find the anointing it's the anointing that breaks the yoke every minister should seek that anointing every church member should seek that anointing you ought to come in every service lord whatever let me come under your anointing [Music] amen but when god leaves a place or home or church or religious system it is desolate and there's no desolation like that desolation jesus says concerning concerning the temple your house is no longer my house it's left desolate i'm leaving it desolate means solitary lonely uninhabited deserted deprived of aid and protection is like a flock deserted by a shepherd of a woman neglected by her husband or from whom the husband withholds himself you see this is a condition of desolation and when that happens she no longer brings for children there's no more births in the church or i'm not talking about additions because we dedicate them at an altar i i'm not talking about additions because we baptize them in a pool i'm talking about births where there's a dine out to sin and men and women are born again by the spirit of god filled with the holy ghost amen so you see you know with the church he withdraws himself from her she'll never no longer bear a seed of his she'll never no more have a child born in her in her movement that is fired by him he no longer will be her husband he no longer will be her caregiver what happens to church when god says your your lukewarmness nauseates me this church is no longer my church god puts her away you see israel was the woman that god had entered into covenant with this happened on mount sinai when he gave the law and god entered into covenant with them he would he would address her with through jeremiah ezekiel hosea as his wife and then he would tell she's going to whoring she's become a prostitute and then of course you see you say brother tim but that that's a that was israel back there but that's the problem with the last day people that all call themselves christians but according to the bible there are they are prostitutes and harlots the great and her daughters and there's a reason they're called that because they rejected his headship they don't want his children and that's what brother branham told us that in the invisible union he said there's some people coming together whether the invisible union and god is uniting and there's a marriage that is going on but there are others that have rejected him they don't want his children they don't want acts 2 38 blabbering streaming's yelling the youngins they don't want none of them but he said that's the only kind the word can bring forth now in marriage and divorce brother branham gets pretty plain and he you know he's talking about marriage and relationships and so on and he says now he can put her away but she cannot put him away he did it and proved it in the days when luther wesley pentecost when they have refused to become a further part of him by having a spiritual sexual affair to become pregnated with further part of the word you understand she refused the lutheran church refused for christ to have any more desire with her luther refused it and you're let me say this you're going to call me something anyhow so it is today with every one of them they fail to take that word they refuse christ and any woman that refuses a man is child has no right to be a wife to him amen remember in the bible when when the king married esther because the queen refused he just got him another one what happened when she refused to come out with the king and obey him the same thing it is with a woman that refuses to be a wife to her husband now this is very important i i don't want you to go sideways on this because there's a lot of problems in marriages today and and you say well brother tim that just fit our situation but let me tell you something i just wonder have you been treating that woman like a queen have you really been a prince in your home is there really some godly leadership is the love that that you owe being given i could i i could say a lot of things right here but it's a mixed crowd but i just want you to understand this ain't a one-way street you see now again but the church let's get our thoughts back on the church this is the church she has she has refused him and refused his child she didn't want him she didn't want his births she didn't want his spirit she don't want his worship come on this is the condition of the last day church now i'm trying to get this to you because there is a reason that god put them away and is called you understand there is a reason god's done what he's done in this day amen because there the church has become a christ rejecter a man crucify him again put his put him to an open shame rejected his word rejects his headship rejects his leadership come on amen don't want it don't want his spirit in their midst refuses his word now look here at israel now in jerusalem now it's 70 years 70 years before jerusalem is actually destroyed but god is already saying you're finished now you went there the next day there's no more there's no changes they're still bringing sacrifices they're still offering animals they're still you know do all the rituals everything else it looks like everything's going on just like normal and you're saying to me brother tim you're you're you're declaring that god has rejected the denominational system and they keep on and they're growing and they got more members and they're getting bigger and they got more money and they got more programs and all of this when god said it's finished it's over and it's 70 years before it's destroyed but god has already declared judgment on them and the church went on with their ceremonies and went to the same altar and offered the same sacrifice but at the day of crucifixion from then on their offerings was no longer accepted the same offers abraham gave the same offerings that isaac offered the same offerings that samuel would offer the same offerings that jeremiah ezekiel priest right down to the ages we would all offer now and let me tell you it brought salvation to that time it brought a blood cleansing but all of a sudden it changes and now you can offer the same thing your granddaddy offered go to the same altar your granddaddy went to my mother went to this church and my grandfather and my great-grandpa you can go to the same place and find no mercy find nothing to save you from the judgment coming now so you see matthew 24 verse 1 and jesus went out and departed from the temple now he would depart from this temple never to return again his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple and jesus said unto them see not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down he's speaking judgment now why would the jewish church in its temple have such an indictment and such a judgment because christ was spurned the sent the word made flesh rejected amen now no longer would they represent him there would never be another prophet that would rise up out of their movement their system there would never be they would no longer be god's voice although there was a long list of saints sages prophets that had come from her abraham great prophets david a prophet king you know on and on and on i say jeremiah and daniel and ezekiel and oh my prophet after prophet word afterward but now there would no more ever be another prophet come from them no longer would the voice of god ever speak through them they would no longer be god's represented representation amen because of the rejection of christ they too would become rejected now i want you to look with me to in psalms 69 20. let's get a picture of the rejected christ i hope i don't background too much so that i don't get into what i want to speak about but psalm 69 20. reproach has broken my heart and i'm full of heaviness i look for something to take pity but there is none for comforters and i found none they gave me also calls for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink left their table become a snare before them that and that which should have been for their welfare let it become a trap in other words the table that they ate from let the very things that they fed upon become a snare to them you know again you know that which should have been for their welfare if i understand right there when the romans did come in and destroy jerusalem they gathered all of the people into the temple and and every you know surely god's going to save us their little ones are children now all of them they gathered them all in there but i want you to know a word had came before that that it told them that jerusalem would be surrounded and they would lay trenches around her and when you see them start coming down and you flee from here let him that's on the housetop not go back and give anything in other words run get out of there flee i want you to understand that's been the voice that god used in this day right away get out get out of those systems get out of that lukewarmness get out of that that rebellion against god get out of that move that won't let god move get out because we see him surrounding we see the enemy surrounded and about to pull the church into the tribulation and the bible talks about the tribulation of those days he said never again would there be tribulation like upon one group of people like it was there and those jews went into not just a few days of tribulation they have been under persecution and tribulation now for 2 000 years why because they rejected their messiah and what will happen to the gentiles because of rejection the word for their day they will go to the tribulation but right now they're still there amen there's still an opportunity and to flee from there am i don't don't let your shirt hit your back get out move run get into the word flee into christ you know people fled from california it wasn't california to run from it was getting to christ what difference does it make if you go down in the in the in you know in the the waves of the sea or whatever else if your soul is right with god let the table let let the very things that they've been eating from let the very words that they've been taken for themselves condemn them let the very bible that they hold to be true judge them and that would should have been for their welfare let it be a strap let their eyes be darkened if that's not prophesied again of the last day what is let their eyes be darkened that they see not let their loins continually to shake pour out that indignation upon them let thy wrathful anger take a hold of them let their habitation be desolate amen and let none dwell in their tents for they persecute him whom thou is smitten and they talk to grief of those whom thou has wounded add an iniquity to their iniquity and let them not come into thy righteousness let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous my goodness this is what happens to the christ rejecters this is what would happen to the pharisees sadducees the men of that day that were pious and religious and catholicism who could even sometimes you know prophesy and so on like that let it now become desolate let god no longer dwell in their tents let the spirit never move in there again and you talk about rejection now brother branham talks the same thing and and he tells us and know it not and he he looks there and he sees the condition of the church world and the condition they are and he says the higher that you rise in god the more sinful everything looks you know there again it depends on where you're at if you're you're on level with them you don't see the sin but you start moving higher in god you begin to see the things that are wrong amen the higher you rise in god the more sinful everything gets and he said sometimes in prayer you can imagine when the holy spirit takes you into a sphere then the whole thing looks chaos and then you come back and the people think you're a rascal or or sarcastic or you're full you stand out as a crank always rebuking the people but if you ever climb into those fears one time when you can be in the presence of god not through emotion but through genuine holy spirit lifting up the whole thing is wrote ichabod the glory of the lord has departed from the whole denominational outfit now this is what a prophet would look and he says i've been lifted up in the place and here in this place and the higher i get the more sinful that thing looks the more evil it becomes and he says until i can pronounce it's ichabod and the glory of the lord has departed from the whole denominational outfit remember in the days of eli remember what it was and when the priest had become his sons had become um unlawful in doing evil things and molesting the women at the cords and and stealing from the sacrifices and taking what was not theirs and and cheating and everything else and there was all kinds of sin in the ministry and amen and then and then the judgment came by the word of the prophet and remember a baby is born during that time and that baby is born what happens the ark of the lord is taken amen the word is gone it's taken out from their midst it's captured is taken down into philistine in the philistine and here the word is taken the word is departed now the priest the old priest dies and as it does a baby is born and the child the offspring of all of that heartache of all that trouble was ichabod meaning the glory of the lord has departed now this thing repeats again this last day now ezekiel foretold the destruction of the temple and the rejection of israel i'd like you to go with me to ezekiel 9 verse 1. now brother branham would parallel this scripture for our day as well but this actually you know it physically becomes fulfilled in the um in the destruction of jerusalem ezekiel 9 1. and he cried within my ear with a loud voice saying cause him to have charge of the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand the whole six men came by the way of the higher gate was light toward the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen and with a writer's ink horn by his side and they went in and stood by the brazen altar now brother branham describes this as the holy ghost he's the one that's marking and the glory of the the god of israel was gone up from the cherub now wait a minute let's get the picture the shekinah glory leaves leaves the leaves the cherubims where the ark of the covenant is come on that is supposed to be hovering over the the chair the ark of the covenant which contains the word and it it leaves look where that and he goes to the threshold so he is leaving the church and he called to the man with the clothed with lennon which had the writer's incorn by his side and the lord said unto him go through the mississippi to the midst of jerusalem set a mark upon the foreheads of them the men that signed cried for all the abominations that's done in the midst of thereof and to the others he said in mine here go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have pity slay utterly young old and young both maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom the mark and begin where at my sanctuary because judgment begins at the house of god amen and then they begin to at the ancient men which were before the house and he said defile the hard the house and fill the courts with the slain and go you forth and they went forth and slew the in the city now here god says defile defile the house defile the temple now why does he do this because in the in the chapter before in chapter eight they have set up all kinds of the idol worship in the house of god having rejected jehovah and god said i'm leaving cause i'm not sharing my love with another amen i'm gonna have a bride she'll be without spot or wrinkle i'm not sharing my love with another you my my wife with another man i'm not putting up with that come on and he leaves and as he leaves he says defy the house you've defiled it you've divided with your false doctrines your creeds your dumbness all the things against the spirit now i'm going to defile it and he would say not one stone to be left on another now and it came to pass while they were slaying i was left and i fell upon my face and cried and i said oh lord god will i destroy all the residue of israel in that pouring out of that fury and he said unto me the iniquity of the house of israel in judah is exceeding great the land is full of blood the city full of perverseness for they say the lord has forsaken the earth and the lord see it not they're saying he's not the same yesterday today and forever and as for me also my eyes shall not spare neither will i have pity but i will recompense their way upon their head and behold the man clothed with linen which had the ink horn by his side reported the matters that i have done as thou has commanded me so god spoke judgment and because of the sin that had entered the house of god amen then judgment had to begin at the temple and the glory of the lord had to leave this kind of glory the pillar of fire left the cherub and moved to the door leaving the church israel exactly like revelation 3. i'll spew you out of my mouth you've rejected me you've turned my word down you don't want my spirit now i'm rejecting you you see what a serious thing it is to reject the move of the spirit of god now let me back up this for a moment we've had things that god has spoken about in this day there's a man um and i and i told this some years ago but there's a man by the name of clayton's son moore he wrote a book called show the house to the house and in there he told of a personal testimony of spending time he said three hours with brother branham while he was in jamaica in february of 1958 and brother branham would speak to him concerning the world uh political and and spiritual events including what part certain individuals and organizations would would play and some more had this to say he said to my knowledge every insight brother branham related that day has been fulfilled exactly as prophesied even to the very year the holy spirit showed him that such events would take place mr sun more further stated are related that the hour of darkness descended in or beyond 1977 was so black that brother branham could see no further and it was a point that he maintained to his to his death now if the man is right in what he says then we are now 44 years advanced into the hour of darkness so it's getting so dark that brother branham said you come where we couldn't see our hand in front of our face we're here we're talking about how many people are going home we're talking about coveting economies world everything crumbling are you with me we are now 44 years advanced into the hour of darkness now i want to stop for a minute and talk about 1977 because you know it's a place that everybody goes to in order to dismiss brother branham as being a prophet they love to say they just love to say he failed uh prophecy concerning 1977. well i'll just tell you this if that was his only failure well then i i'll i'll just say this to him he was more accurate than any of them i just put him up besides their prophets and you know let me just say actually you know if a person is fair and wants to judge everything the same then billy graham is also a false prophet because he predicted the lord would come in 1959. i got that in my library in his book that they wrote said he's learned after that not to make such predictions but we know of the seven major convicted visions that brother branham had in 1933 and i want to just speak about the moment to just show you where we're at and he would talk about the laodicean age began around the turn of the century perhaps 1906 and said how long will it last as a servant of god is that multitudes of visions with which none has failed let me predict i did not say prophesy but predicted this age will end around 1977. and he said if you pardon a personal note here i base this prediction on seven major continuous visions it came to me one sunday morning in june 1933 and the lord jesus spoke to me and said that the coming of the lord was drawing nigh but before that he came seven major events would transpire i wrote them all down and that morning i gave forth the revelation of the lord the first was mussolini mussolini would invade ethiopia and that nation would fall as it steps that vision surely did cause some repercussions and some were very angry when i said it would not believe it but it happened that way he just walked in there with his modern arms and took it over and the natives didn't have a chance but the vision all said mussolini would come to a horrible end with his own people turning on him and that came to pass just exactly as it said the next vision foretold in austria by the name of adolf hitler who would rise up as dictator over germany and he would draw the world into war and it showed the secret line how the troops would have a terrible time to overcome it it showed that hitler would come to mysterious end the third vision was in the realm of world politics showed me there would be three great isms fascism and nazism communism but the two would be swallowed up in the third and the voice admonish watch russia watch russia keep your eyes on the king of the north the fourth vision would show great advances in science that would come forth after the second world war it was headed up in the vision of a plastic bubble top car that was running down beautiful highways under remote control so people were seated in this car without a steering wheel and they were playing some type of game to muse themselves we're here and the fifth mission had to do with the moral problem of our age centered mostly around women god showed me that women began to be out of their place with the granting of the vote this ain't popular today then they began to cut off their hair which signified they were no longer under the authority of a man but insisted on either equal rights or in most cases more than equal rights she adopted men's clothing went to a state of undress until the last picture i saw was a woman naked except for a little big leaf type apron and with this vision i saw the terrible perversion and moral plight of the whole world which all includes even the homosexual sodomite movement because if you don't believe that's sodomite the women were the first cross-dressers then in the sixth vision there are rose up in america most beautiful but cruel woman she held in her the people in her complete power i believe this was the rise of the roman catholic church so i knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in america do a popular vote by women and he says again the 70th week he said i predicted and said i saw a great woman stand up beautiful looking dressed and high royals like purple she's a great ruler in the united states and i said perhaps the catholic church i don't know her to be the catholic church i don't know i can't say only thing i've seen i've seen the woman that was all and then again from that time he said remember he said thus saith the lord there will be a woman ruled before the end time she'll either be president or vice president or be the catholic church as a woman i've seen her a great woman the nation is bowed to her it'll be one before the end time just saith the lord write it down and find out your young people see if it happens if it isn't then i'm a false prophet and we're here right down to the color of dress the woman wore and then the seventh and last vision was i heard a most terrible explosion and i turned to look and i saw nothing but debris and craters and smoke all over the land of america and then he would say based on these seven visions along with the rapid changes which i swept which have swept the world in the last 50 years i predict i do not prophesy that these visions will have come to pass by 1977. now we know there's definitely some of them didn't make it but predict can mean prophesy or divine but brother branham was clear this is not a prophecy the definition of the word predict is not always prophesy or divine though predict can mean speculate envision invisage imagine picture estimate conjecture guess or hazard a guest so since he said it's not prophecy he's saying i'm hazard in the guests you know i'm estimating i'm imagining you know this is i'm speculating on this now in 70 weeks of daniel he was clear he said now i don't want anyone to go away misunderstanding this tape's still playing i don't want anyone to misunderstand this don't unders misunderstand now and say brother branham said jesus would come in 1977. i've never said no such a thing jesus may come today but i predicted that between 33 and 77 something would take place that these things that i've seen come to pass in the vision would take place and five of them has already taken place getting the laodicean church age as he preached it remember the church's book is a paraphrase and and a grammarization of what he said so he said we believe that churches started in a.d 1906. now i predict now remember predict especially you listen to the table i don't say it will be but i predict that it will end by 1977 that the church will go into into completely into apostasy bear that in mind the church will go completely into apostasy now and he says and she will be ousted out of the mouth of god and the second coming of the rapture of the church of christ might come any time now i could miss that a year i can miss that 20 years i could miss it 100 years i don't know where but i just predict going to the vision he showed me taking the time the way it's progressing and i say it'll be somewhere between 33 and 77 this great nation is going to strike a war that's going to blow us to peace at least this great nation is going to strike a war that are going to blow it to bits now it's pretty close it's awful close and i could be wrong i'm predicting everybody understand say amen if you do now this again i'm going to read this from the exposition of the seven church ages as you know as i said was a paraphrasing of what he said on tape brother level took the things he taught and made grammatical changes and he says it in here based on these seven visions along with rapid changes which has swept the world that i predict i do not prophesy these visions will have all come to pass by 1977 and though many feel this is irresponsible statement and view of the fact that jesus said no man know it the day or the hour i still maintain this prediction after 30 years because jesus did not say no man could not know the year the month of the week and which is coming was to be completed so i repeat i sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the word along with divine inspiration that's 1977 art and that word ought means a probability but not a certainty to terminate the world's systems and usher in the millennium now listen let's get some understanding first of all he said i as i i i sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the word along with divine inspiration now you know years ago we stopped right there and see that was prophecy see he had divine inspiration to say that no the divine inspiration was the seven visions so he's saying i as a private student of the word along with having seen seven visions of the end time that 77 ought or is a probability but not a certainty terminate the world's systems and usher in the millennium now so now let's notice here some things now of course we have seen where he says i don't say it will be i am not prophesying this is a prediction this is i'm hazarding a guess amen but i can miss it a year or 20 years i can miss it a hundred years i don't know where and i could be wrong i'm predicting which again he said is not prophecy so i'm not using the word predict as a prophecy i'm using it as i'm not divining here i'm not prophesying i'm not saying god said this i am saying i'm hazarding a guest in other words the sun lord would say it it got so dark he couldn't see beyond that that we would advance into the hour of darkness until a prophet couldn't even see beyond that but he told us that there were going to be things that would happen and that the church would go completely into apostasy and be ousted out of the mouth of god now i want just to get your thoughts on this he said it would terminate world systems now you learn to keep things in context so when you got to seven churches book and brother branham uses the phrase terminate world systems well then what does that mean i mean i've said you know we still got the united states government we still got the russian governments we still got china we still got you know the catholic church we got all kinds of things that are still going on right but what is the world's system now he was so keep it in context with his thoughts in the sardisian church age he said now they had what the world could not have jesus said when he went away he would send his spirit which the world could not receive that's right the world or world system could not receive him that's what organization is it is a world system and you show me a world church system that is full of the holy ghost i want to see it if you can show me such a church you'll find a mistake in the word no sir not one of these messengers were organized either they were put out or got out because they were convicted of the sin of organization how can the holy spirit possibly be in an organization when it is the organization that takes the place of the spirit and denominations take the place of the word remember organization is death it just can't be any other way if the world takes over the spirit departs so now what happened amen what happened god brought an end terminating world systems he left the systems of religion come on now and he vindicated a word he opened the book and loosed the seals come on now are you with me now amen and when doing so he absolutely terminates the world systems of religion every one of them and they're no longer his voice they no longer speak for him and to so he calls out a bride who will be his boss [Applause] man she will be one with the word because she is a word born bride now world systems were indicted and terminated 14 years before 1977. i sit out of the mouth of god because in the year 1963 when the book was that was shown as sealed with seven sealed mystery was unsealed and the word was revealed god terminated and brought to an end every organizational spirit now the opening of the book terminated and made obsolete every teaching of man and every doctrine of man and god put away the church now i'm just going to say to you stack up all the books stack them all up if you ever go in the bible bookstore just look at the hundreds commentaries books writings on this writing on that writing on predestination writing on eternal security writing on baptism uh you take all of the doctrinal thesis bible commentaries books on christ coming books on the tribulation books on being left behind books on the apocalypse books on all of that and they were rendered obsolete because i'll tell you this all of them were hazarding the gas but when god spoke opening up the seven seals it was no longer a gas it was not a man come on now it did not come from the thinking of man it came from god out of heaven out of heaven came seven ninety angels hallelujah representing the seven church ages were fearless or completed that we had reached the end and that brings about the changing of a dispensation and this happens in this last day now if you think i'm preaching something new i'm not i started i preached i preached these sermons back in 1999-2000 long long before that but this this this is something that we believe and i'm just refreshing you as to where we're at in this hour of darkness i'm trying to show you again and re-emphasize to you who where is the voice of god today where is god where is god at show us the father that's what i was preaching last sunday show us the father where is he at and they were looking at him and didn't know when you see me you seen the father and today the people are looking for jesus and he's here but where is he are you with me he's not coming walking down the aisle with nail scars he's in a people you see that's what he said show us the father the last days is god in his people [Applause] behold the word bride that is his body that's who he's speaking through that's who he's revealing that's who he's walking through that's who's doing the miracles hey man it's your hands laid on the sick and they shall recover it's your voice taking the word and speaking it against your enemy it is you it brings about the dispensation of the fullness of times now where everything is brought to its fullness where partial word gives gives way to the fullness of the word in the in ephesians chapter 1 verse 9 heaven made known to us the mystery of his will this is what god has done one more time he's brought paul's gospel and restored it making known to you the mystery of his will according to good pleasure which he had purpose in himself that in the dispensation notice this the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him so everything is going to be gathered into him there's going to be a uniting of all that he is every promise that he is everywhere he is all of his people into him now he can't gather the church because she don't need him she don't want him but he swore i'll have a church washed and cleansed by the word and paul declares he will gather in the one things that are in heaven and things on the earth and would gather them all into himself so we are in the hour of the harvest season of the gathering where he'll even gather the saints going on with the saints that are living and bring them all together in him to catch them up together to him this is rapture hour in this hour of darkness now so you see again with regard to the fullness of time you know that's the end of history it's the climaxes of the ages is that right to bring all things together in christ both things that are in heaven and things on the earth so so again you know this is what he's doing is we are here in the climax of the ages now brother branham would use the pyramid to to to to describe or to type three different things he would type the church or individuals let me start with the individual he would type us as being believing by faith accepting the lord adding the faith virgin virgin knowledge becoming the tabernacle living god's dwelling place the holy ghost uniting you and god together sealing you together as one so you know the capstone of the believer is the baptism of the holy ghost it's the token without it you're not complete you might have started believing in the lord but you are an incomplete until you get the holy ghost it's the seal of god it's the capstone now then number two he would do what he would finish the mysteries how many is with me now so we've had mysteries that had started being restored down to the ages and luther got justification wesley thank you i'm just hitting some of the high points and we come right up up to the top and it gets capped off with seven thunders which were the revelations that were contained in the seven seals come on now so the final mystery opens the book or completes all the mysteries of god so god will use the prophet to cap off all the mysteries once he comes there are no more mysteries that's why i don't like mystery preachers because when you get through it's still a mystery amen but brother we're not preaching mysteries anymore we're preaching revelation we're preaching revealed truth are you with me now amen now this is this is important to understand it's capped off the seven seals would open up and bring to light every every truth of the bible concerning the bride are you with me now then of course there is the third one which types out what god will do he's come through seven ages and man comes down we're the last age and we're the lad we're the age that meets the capstone and the capstone is the physical return of christ so again when we say capstone what are we talking about amen it can mean the physical return of christ uniting of the bride and the groom amen and all seven angels being raised up to meet him in the air that's the capstone we're looking for that's the one that hadn't come amen we're looking for the coming of the lord we're going to meet him in the air but we have been capped by the holy ghost we are a sealed unit we're part of the promise every one of you fit right in the pyramid fit right there in the promise of god amen a rapture ready church going to meet him in the air amen waiting for the coming of the lord and remember the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost which is what we have worked in a small measure as as the body come up from through the capstone but when he comes he will seal her off until even the dead in christ for thousands of years will rise up [Applause] and we're living in the hour oh my the holy ghost has come you can receive the capstone for your life and man the thunders and mysteries have been revealed and there's no more mystery who is capped off it's a finish there's one more cat so we're waiting on and that's for jesus to come back hallelujah and when he comes we will fit him exactly as bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh and life of his life and power of his power do you know we are living in the hour where time is no more well in the world you mean by that let's go to revelation 10 verse 1. this is another scripture for our day we're standing right here is where we're at in the fulfillment of this scripture this is our day and i saw another mighty angel this is in comparison to revelation 9 where abaddon apollyon there raises up all where all the world is worshiping and then idolatry and it's shown there and we look away from there and said now and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven he's clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head his face was as it were the sun his feet as pillars of fire all of this is symbology and he as in his hand a little book open what was sealed in revelation 5 is now open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth so where the two beast powers come from the sea and the earth he sets his feet upon them and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth so he shouts so as he descends he does three things first thessalonians 4. shout voice trumpet and when he cried or he shouts with a loud voice and it's like when a lion roared because it's the king speaking and when he cried in this shout seven thunders utter their voices so when this message comes mysteries are revealed now this a thunder is when god says something but it isn't time for it to be made known so you don't want it known yet we're not in the days of the thunder we're in the days of the voice where it becomes a known truth now what and the seven thunders what had uttered their voices and i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying seal up it's not time john you can't write it seal up the things with seven thunders uttered write them not and the angel which i saw stand up on the sea upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven oh my he's making a sworn affidavit he is absolutely making a vow and he swore by himself because he's the one that liveth forever and ever who created heaven the things that there are him to see and so on that there should be time no longer we are in that hour time is no more amen but watch now the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery of god shall be finished as he had declared to his servants a prophet so now what happens the time you say brother tim time time's no more what do you got a calendar for how come you still got to watch on and how come there's still time in the millennium and yet time is no more what does this mean it means the time to keep the silence the time to keep this a mystery keep it in contact the kind the time to keep this quiet is over with and you're in the hour for the time for mysteries is over with amen the silence has been broken amen by what god sent in a prophet it wasn't me that opened the seals it even when brother branham did over to the seal it was christ that opened the seals but it was open to a prophet the word came to a prophet and that's why the first phase of the rapture is a shout it is a prophet bringing a message it's a message to awaken to the people amen is to awaken you to your rights it's awaken your understanding it's awakened to you to who you are to where you are in this hour are you with me now so revelation 10 declares the system of men is over with that men have had their ideas they've had their doctrines for thousands of years but now christ comes down with an open book for god is his own interpreter are you with me christ the son of man the word comes down with the open book he's got his left feet on the land in the sea and he declares when one swears with an oath the time shall be no more in the days of the voice of this of the seventh angel when he sounds his message the mystery of god will be finished the time virtually mystery is over with hallelujah do you know you're in the hour where christ is not withholding anything from you but he is revealing his entire deity to the people of the last age [Applause] do you know he couldn't reveal his mind to some lady that was or some little girl that was you're going to be a bride a six seven-year-old girl he had to wait until we come to the maturity now so now christ puts his foot on the land of the sea swears with an oath time shall be no more or another other translation said there will be no more delay in other words the delaying of this mystery is over i've delayed it i've held it back the other agents didn't know it but you know it it's been revealed to you like i said don't throw away your we're still in time we will be until the millennium but i want you to hear him from the breach he said we'll see later is the end time when time has run out no denomination has a right for the interpretation of the book no man has a right to interpret it it is the lamb who interprets it what brother branham said himself i would have made a horrible mistake i had some ideas and some notes and i was going to walk out and i said well that's the best i can do to best start my knowledge this is what others have said and i'll tell you this is why i know and about that time he came in the room and here it came contrary to my own thinking because no man has a right to interpret it not even brother branham it is the lamb who interprets and the lamb is the one who speaks it and the lamb makes the word to be made known to be known by the vindicating and bringing the word of life notice again he continues notice is not revealed until this book is not revealed until the church ages and denominational agents has run out and there's time no more it's only revealed after church ages and denominational ages has run out that's the reason they the things in such a scruple tonight they pick up a little doctor and they run over this side and say this is it and another picks up another doctor and runs over this side and said this is it and each one believe it builds a denomination under it until we got hundreds of denominations but still in all of it to see confusion the people are wondering what is truth and that ain't the condition today notice what he said notice what he says he said the book is not revealed until denominational ages has run out when he terminates it then he reveals it now again this is the age that we're living in this is the day where god is called a heart a halt to men's idea this is what the day when god is his own interpreter we've had a luther that interpreted the word and some of it he got correct we had the john smith to interpret the word for the anna baptist and here's some of it he got correct a lot of it he's wrong on amen but but again we are coming the day where there's no more guessing amen the same one that never guessed telling names addresses diseases what the doctor looked like everything else told the future told the past could go back 40 years what was he showing he could go back into the mind of god and even tell you things your great-grandfather did come on amen what was it if god could do that then god could go all the way back to where things were sealed up and open it up all the way down to the end revealing the entire program of god to a people in the last days now notice this is the day that god calls to halt men's ideas your house is left desolate 70 years goes by but when god said it's finished it's finished i don't accept your worship it's over with there is nothing left there to rapture them many of them go into the tribulation period and i believe some of them perhaps will be saved during the tribulation those that are really sincere in their hearts will be not saved in the tribulation but because they've had a profession of faith they'll watch the robes in the blood of the lamb and by their works they'll be judged be given life amen that's god's mercy he's more merciful than you ever thought not only was he merciful to call you out to take you in a rapture but he was also merciful to those who were blinded some way by false prophets misunderstood and wind up in the tribulation and he still gives some of them life multitude without a number he said god that even when the jews reject him he gives them another chance and here the benjamin group comes in on the last day and 144 000 is sealed god is the god rich in mercy when the lamb took the book the mighty angel came down and made this declaration world systems were terminated church systems were terminated it was the beginning of the end and god was calling out a bride who would be a word bride now it's the hour of the seventh seal because the seventh seal is is coming but this but it's not a singular event i'm trying to get something i'm trying to so your heart won't be troubled you're looking and say well when when's jesus going to come in when's there going to be an end to all of this trouble and when i'm telling you we're in the end i'm telling you things are winding up i'm telling you prophecies are being fulfilled i'm telling don't let your heart be troubled he's at work he hasn't abandoned the project he didn't come and say i'm sending a forerunner and i'm sitting and sending him with a with a message and then forget it all go back in the heavens and close the doors and say well i give up no no even though the church rejects him i'll have some overcomers even though the church don't want him i'll have somebody who wants their eyes with eyes out amen the the the word of god i'll wash their eyes with they're going to see in a time of darkness when everybody else is blind they're going to see what god's doing a little while the world has seen me no more but you'll see me i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world others won't see it but i you'll see me i'm going to be wide right in your midst i'm going to be healing your sick amen i'm going to be casting out devils hallelujah i'm going to be speaking with new tongues i'm going to be working there among the believers i'm going to be in you unto the end of the world i'm not going to leave you comfortless i will come to you i will be the one working in you i'll be the one living in you i'll be one manifesto myself i have come down hallelujah i have come down to deliver you amen and i've got a message saying let my people sin can't hold them i believe can't hold them darkness can't hold us know that nothing of the world can hold up let my people go hallelujah we've got a message to the devil today that we are under the anointing of a mighty angel and there ain't enough devils in hell that can stop this bride she's not going back she's not turning around she's progressing she's moving forward she's not backsliding she's not getting lukewarm she's not getting cold and formal she's not gonna she's not gonna go down into the cycle of death she will defeat death itself because she's been called and ordained and predestinated for the day and hour that we're living in i say hallelujah amen the world systems are terminated but god hasn't terminated you he said i'm taking you in a rapture i'm not gonna leave you behind that a hoof is gonna leave be left behind i'm taking your loved ones i'm taking your children i'm taking your wife i'm taking your husband i'm taking your grandchildren i'm taking off and we're all going we're not going to be left behind we are going we're on our way to the promised land and there's nothing the devil can do to stop it hallelujah he can't stop divine healing he can't stop the power of god he can't stop true worship he can't stop the joy of the lord he can't stop the power of his christ he can't stop it he ain't got enough the devil don't have enough but the god you serve has put enough more than enough he's el shadia he's more than enough he's the provider he's the savior he's everything you have hallelujah we're here at the end of all things everything is winding up seventh seal opens and it breaks the silence don't start silence it finishes the silence and when it does it starts unfolding the end time you look around what you look and see is the end time unfold let not your hearts be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many theophanies yours is coming back for you others have left to go to it and they'll bring their bodies back here or that's often are here to meet their bodies but we'll be changed the voice of the resurrection there is a people of god who's speaking for him let him move in your life look don't speak for the world don't speak for sin don't speak for fornication and adultery and filthiness of the flesh and pornography don't speak for that speak his word speak his promise let it be manifested in your life father today commit this service in your hands speak to hearts lord then lord let it so anoint us till we speak do people begin to speak to
