Lord and be brought into your place a place of service for you father we ask Lord you'll just help us this evening give us strength and our body and our voice Lord and just minister to your people we pray in Jesus name amen let's turn to Hebrews chap 11 and verse 1 also Matthew chapter 15 and verse 22 amen like to speak to you this evening been been been reading a lot on this and and delling on this a lot about faith I believe faith is a wonderful thing to have especially in a faithless generation ation in a faithless world in a world that doesn't even get more and more to be less that believe in God and the things of God and and to be one that is still standing in spite of it all that's a wonderful thing amen Hebrews chap 11 and verse one says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so the things which are seen were not made of things which do not appear also Matthew chap 15 and verse 22 said behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crith after us but he answered and said I not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel then came she and got mad and angry and walked away and stomped her feet no she came and and she came and worshiped him can you imagine this he just said I wasn't sent to you but she still came and worshiped him saying Lord help me she must understood that was her only source of help amen but but he answered and said it is not meat to take the L children's bread and to cast it to the dogs and she said well that's the way you feel about it I'm done no she said truth truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table then Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour amen God bless you you can be seated I I've I've been just going through tons of quotes and I'm still not through just uh reading things where brother Brown spoke about faith I mean that's of course the theme of his entire Ministry was Faith bringing the people to believe am mean that's what he was to do is to bring us back to the faith of the fathers so is no doubt or it's understandable that that would be uh the thread that's all the way through his ministry is Faith is Faith to believe for salvation Faith to believe for Rapture Faith to believe for healing Faith Amen to believe for the things of God and and so I've been looking at these things and I I just want to read this in the um uh in the Amplified version of HEB Hebrews chapter one chapter 11 and verse one in the Amplified I was kind of where it started with me it says now Faith is the Assurance or the title deed or confirmation of things that are hoped for that are divinely guaranteed the evidence of Things Not Seen but it's the conviction of their reality Faith comprehends as fact what cannot be experienced by physical senses for by this kind of Faith the men of old gain Divine approval by faith that is the with an inherent trust and enduring confidence and the power and wisdom and goodness of God we understand that the worlds universes and Ages were framed in created they were formed and put in order and equipped for the intended purpose by the word of God so the things which are seen now are were made were was not made out of things which are visible in other words what we see today with our natural eyes one day there was a DA that you couldn't see them with these natural eyes but they were literally spoken to existence by the word of God and so we know Faith finds sources that thing that our eyes cannot see it finds a place amen that it can hold on to that no matter what our senses declare or does not declare it has an anchor there Faith sees what blind people doesn't see amen and and I'm not talking about blind as far as with your eyes but there are actually blind people we know that actually could see more than people that could see with natural eyes because they had Faith to believe we we know the blind man in the Bible that was was born blind is one of my favorite stories or one of my favorite healings and of Jesus's Ministry was the blind man who who were born blind and and they asked him was he born blind because of he of his sin or or or because of his mother or father sin he said no but that the glory of God might be revealed in him and and we know the story of how Jesus would bend down and take some good dirt and the and the Very elements it would take to make those eyes and and to cre the Creator back doing his creation and his creative work and building eyeballs and placing them there in those sockets and he tells him to go wash and he came back seeing amen you know and and he begins to testify of that and people begin to ask questions and they wonder why and what you know how could this be and and and it comes down to it and all their question he just shakes his head and you said you know this is a marvelous thing that never since before the Earth since the Earth been created has a man man been born blind given his sight but yet you don't know who that is in other words I know who he is because I was once a blind man I once had no eyeballs I once had nothing but empty sockets but God only God could do what that man did amen there ain't nobody else upon this earth that could do what he did there's no uh uh medical intervention there's nothing that could do what creative power can do and so that blind man saw what more more than what men with natural eyesight could see they saw a man that would they would call him a illegitimate child they would call him a a b elub they would call him all kind of names but this man had an experience and a faith that anchored deeper than what he could see with the natural eyes and I I believe that's what we have to be the same kind of people that no matter if we see or if we feel or if we hear that has nothing to do with it our faith is anchored because we have an experience with God and God has showed us who he really is in the time that we're living in amen and we have been placed in this place not because of of who we are what we've done but God has placed Us in this place that we are in for the glory of God he's placed you in the battle that you're in he's placed you in the situation that you're in or the or the trouble or the trial or the sickness or whatever it is it's only for one reason that's for the glory of God that God's glory can be revealed in you if it's a sickness it's so the glory of healing God's healing can be revealed in you amen if it's if it's sin is so the glory of God's salvation can be revealed in you that later on in life you'll begin to realize there's a deeper anchor than what you can see because there'll be a time you don't know long you may not feel God's presence for a while you may not see it you may not see the supernatural or see the the visible manifestations of the supernatural but that has nothing to do with it because your faith is anchored deeper than what your eyesight can declare or what your senses can declare amen there's of faith that rest there on the Eternal Promises of God now these five senses we all need them to operate in this world but these five senses that we were given were given to us for one reason and that was to contact the Earthly world that was the only reason was given it's these five senses was not given to you to contact the supernatural realm Can You Feel the supernatural yes sometimes you can feel the moving of the spirit sometimes you can see it sometimes you can see the spiritual uh cloud or the spiritual fire sometimes God allows those things to happen but that is not what God gave you to Anchor amen he gave you a faith to believe no matter if you don't see it if you don't feel it if you don't understand it no matter what you have an anchor that'll hold there regardless of the storm regardless of the feelings regardless of of this that and the other it does not matter amen there's a there's a faith there's a substance there that goes beyond what you can see goes beyond what you can taste goes beyond what you can smell or here amen goes beyond what is seen by the natural senses of the man amen Faith tells you that it's so no matter what your eyesight declares amen Faith tells you that it's Soul no matter what your body declares or no matter what your feelings declare amen faith can declare to you that you're healed and you still just feel just as sick as you ever felt amen you may look just as sick as you ever ever look but faith will come down upon your heart now we know what faith is faith is the revelation of God's word and I want you to understand it is the Revelation that God's word is God heals God delivers God sets free amen God faith say stands there and Faith doesn't reason it Faith knows where it's at so Faith acts and it holds on and it doesn't move from that it don't matter what says what or what does what it doesn't matter who walks away or who says that it matters not Faith hold holds on anyhow I don't care whatever says this or whoever says that it doesn't move a bit it stays right there well wait wait it don't make any difference amen what is faith faith is something that is revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be come on somebody amen it's not yet but you believe it will be so if you believe it will be it's as good as yet amen and you're going to stand there until it's done no matter what comes your way no matter how many doubters arise no matter how much circumstances says it ain't so doesn't matter how many symptoms denies it doesn't matter what how many doctors reports Den I it it doesn't matter what anything anything else says faith stands there on the Eternal Word of God and it does not waver it does not matter how many winds come how many waves bash against it it'll stand there no matter how long it takes for the answer to come amen this is what he said in Luke chapter 18 and verse one he said he spake a parable unto them this end that men ought to always pray and to not faint he said saying there was in a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversaries and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God nor regard guard man yet because this Widow troubles me I will avenge her lest by her continual coming she wees me and the Lord said hear what the unjudged just said he shall and shall not God avenge his own elect amen I I'm here to tell Satan he's got a day of Vengeance coming Hallelujah which cried day and night unto him though he bear along with him I tell you I tell you not me I tell you he tells you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth amen you notice he didn't say will I find righteousness or will I find churches or will I find holy people will I find faith in other words faith will be something of Great Value and very precious and very rare there would be very rare that somebody will be on his hands day and night that somebody will be calling on him and says I'm going to be here no matter what you say if you don't say anything I'm still going to be knocking come on somebody we give up too quickly on our promises we give up too quickly on the word of God and we say well he didn't answer me in that service well I just I don't know how it's going to it doesn't matter if he answers this service it might be tomorrow it might be the next day but when he comes will he find Faith too many times we give up and the answer is on the way amen somebody that keep on praying in spite of an answer that comes soon enough or not amen Amen brother Timothy someone with enough Faith to knock and keep on knocking not just faith enough to knock once but to keep knocking come on now amen that'll keep asking that'll keep on his hands day and night Lord I I need you to heal this person I I need you to touch this person I I this cancer is after this one Lord come on this one's after this one Lord I I need you to go after this one father I need an answer here Lord I I I'm still here this is another day Lord but I'm still here I still need an answer God and I I'm still calling on you I'm still knowing that you're going to answer cuz you said you will avenge me of my enemies Hallelujah I'm here to tell you that devil that's been against you he's not going to get away with it he's is not going to get away with the torment he's put on the children of the Living God he's not going to get away with the sickness that he's put Upon Our People Upon Our upon our our husbands and our wives he's not going to get away with it but there is an Avenger on his Trail amen there's a little woman of faith that is there knocking saying God do you see what the devil's doing over here do you see what he's doing over here go get him that's the way you want to get God be on his hands not some laical attitude but every morning every night every day all the time constantly just keep seeking keep asking keep knocking some people think if they asked more than twice they denied their faith this is not what he said he said be on his hands be on his hands amen but stand there in faith knowing he's going to answer amen don't go up knocking and know and so discouraged by the time you finally get your nerve up to knock I told this other day somewhere but brother Tim's told this story somewhere I've heard it of the man who who had that flat tire remember that story and he gets that flat tire out in the middle of nowhere and he sees this little light up on a porch way off somewhere and it's late at night and it's it's past midnight and and he don't have a Jack finds out he don't have the tools and he's like man I'm stranded but there's a light up there and if I go up there maybe knock maybe that old farmer up there help me and he starts walking up that way and he said you know by the time I get up there he going to be mad cuz he's already went to bed and he's already he's already you know he's he's got his nightclothes on he ain't going to want to get out in this old weather he ain't going to go out to his barn or wherever it is and he ain't going to want to answer me he ain't going to want to meet me he ain't going to want he ain't going to he ain't going to and all these things are going through his mind by the time he gets up there he didn't talked himself out of it he knocks on the door and the man answered and he said oh just keep your old Jack that's the way we go to God sometimes amen we by the time we get there we done talked oursel out of it and we we we've talked our out of the blessing that God has for us and by the time we'll just keep your old healing keep it all amen because it didn't come in our time frame or it didn't come the moment the way we thought it should listen it ain't got to it ain't about how we think what we want or how we want it God's going to answer he promised that he would and I know he answers preach that before the god that answers listen he brother remember talked about he said God always answers he said many times an unexpected time and an unexpect expected place in an unexpected way but when he comes will he find Faith amen man we look we push that all the way till when he returns but I believe it's a little deeper than that because many times we give up when he's coming hey it's happened many times go go back and read listen to the tapes brother brandom talks about discernment he said that one missed it got up and left as the answer was on the way would have received something if they just stayed right there and held that Faith come on now amen well when when he comes to our services will he find Faith or will he find our doubts and our frustrations and and our past our past times of not getting the answer and all of this in our mind and we you just keep your old Jack Hallelujah anyhow I'm feeling good y'all feeling good okay I just checking keep on knocking it's Wednesday night and I ain't feeling like it we'll do it anyhow yeah well it's Wednesday night and things didn't go the way I thought they ought to go and this all this over here is it doesn't matter that has nothing to do with it amen what you get out on out of service on a Wednesday night really has nothing to do with how good or how bad your day was it has to do with if you have faith when he comes when he comes and he promised he would be he said he would be here tonight I'm just taking him at his word he said where two or three are gathered in my name there I'll be so when he comes I want to have faith to believe and get the answer I've been looking for not come in my old attitude and just keep your old Jack maybe I'll get it Sunday from you maybe I'll get it another day when I'm feeling good I don't feel like toting that Jack noow maybe he had tow it for youall come on somebody hey man we're going to stay on that Jack Amen you know we we have such a weird attitude about things sometimes and not realizing our attitude determines many times what we're going to get CU our attitude is a reflection of our faith hello somebody it's exactly with this sarap phenician woman her attitude was a reflection of her faith amen she could have had a bad attitude very quickly and very really with a righteous cause I mean good LS he called her a dog first he told her I didn't even come to you so just leave and she pressed through that you know and she got on through the song service and she's like well I'm just going to you know I'm going just Lord I just want to worship you he said boy I I I come to the house of Israel I didn't come to a bunch of dogs boy we wouldn't want no Pastor like that would we I didn't come to that she said but yay Lord that's true I am a dog if we'd realize who we really are when we get down to it we nothing we are nothing and we we're just broken down Humanity that undeserving of anything that we don't have nothing we we don't deserve it for him to come down and meet with us we don't deserve for him to walk among us and and to talk to us and to speak to us and and and we don't deserve that that he would come and and put some on a man's heart and deal with him and deal with him and deal with him we don't deserve none of that but he does it anyhow and he comes down and he speaks to us and it's our old attitude that blocks him from doing what he wants to do come on somebody listen he wants to do just as much on a Wednesday night that he wants to do in any special service amen I don't care he wants to do just as much if they ain't but two people on these pews then this building filled with people has nothing to do with it it's the attitude to receive and say God I want to have faith when you come to receive something from God that's why I came that's why I'm here I I have a need I I have something in my life I have my daughter I have this what something going on Lord he said pray this right you say this while you're knocking just keep standing there knock a little while get tired go no just keep standing there say Lord I'm here and I'm not going to leave I'm on your hands now I'm I'm going to stay right here you getting tired of listening hello somebody you get tired of listening I'm having a great time knocking cuz I know you're coming Hallelujah I know if I'll keep my attitude right and I'll stand there and say God I'm still here come on now if there was ever a time for the Church of the Living God to stay knocking for Ron Spencer's healing it's right now we ought to be on his hands day and night God he still has a need he's weak in his body Lord he has sickness there and the old cancer is still eating him up amen but I know you're coming I know you're coming Lord because you said you would you promised it and I'm you tired of listening I'm still here knocking the difference sometimes is if I can say this the right way we and and we're all guilty of it is the need is not as great unless it's our need you understand what I'm saying if it's your daughter or it's your daddy or it's your son then the need is great that's why brother brand talked about he said if I can say it right how he said it he said I always try to put my my myself in their shoes how would you pray if that was your daddy how would you pray if that was your mama or your or your sibling or how would you how would you be asking God Amen if this was your situation come on somebody amen if it was you going through this and it was you dealing with this and it was you day and night never having having separation from it amen many times we have separation and therefore when we have that we forget about it we go days on in before we remember listen there's there's things that we need to bring back to our remembrance amen Satan's always trying to put something else more important he tried to put things more important than healings and deliverances and salvations and prodical coming home and and those things that are truly really important he wants to put your money and your job and this thing that temporary stuff that's not important but buddy if you get out of job you'll pray if you get out of money you'll pray if you get out of things that natural things in your life you'll pray how much more the spiritual things of God how much more of the things amen that really have something to do with something amen that goes beyond what we see or we taste or we smell or we hear how much more the supernatural realm should we ought to be moving into that place Hallelujah anyhow yes but see Satan's always trying to disrupt your faith to belittle your faith or to minimize your faith or to stop your faith or to hinder your faith because he knows God's going to come he has witnessed it too many times he has witnessed it over and over where he thought he had the God's people bound and he thought it was beyond hope he thought it was beyond it wasn't it wasn't even possible anymore that they would be saved they'd been slaves too long or they'd been this that whatever too long but he knows by amen by history that when the people of God begin to call on the name of the Lord amen and then and the Lord begins to move there ain't nothing he's going to be able to do about it and he knows that if he if he if if you really realize who you are and that you're not just a dog or some worthless pup or nobody or nothing but you're a child of God and you're there knocking on the door of your daddy hello somebody amen we're not just knocking on the door of an unjust judge that was only a parable we are knocking on the door of our father amen he not somebody that don't care about what we're going through or don't know the issues and don't know what he knows all about it he's just asking somebody to call and when he comes he wants faith that you're still there knocking Faith he said let me finish that quote he said I'm having a great time knocking cuz I know you're coming that's when something happens he has to get you off his hands so he comes out to answer you Hallelujah faith is not based upon a myth it's not well just go do this or do that or on the words of some man but Faith takes its Eternal resting place upon God's word which is the Bible so if you if you get all tore up in your spirit and you don't know where your your faith seems to kind of lost its anchor you go back to the Bible what does the word say about it by a strip some healed and you put it right back upon it Faith anchor to the word of God puts a perseverance in someone to hold on to the promise it puts a stubbornness about him it puts a fight about them amen when their faith is not anchored in in what some man said or some man's Creed but it's anchored in something that has never failed this word of God has never failed come on somebody it is the power to heal it has the power to save it has the power to set set free it has all the power that we have need of is in this word and if you'll anchor your faith upon the word of God it will not fail it will come to pass no matter what the symptoms say or what the issues are his word said this but unbelief it relies on reasoning I like this it says right here he just he puts it like this unbelief relies on reasons present day things you know why you miss him when he comes sometimes CU unbelief come into your life maybe something happened on a Wednesday and it caused a stir to go a certain way and something happened and all a sudden you're reasoning all kinds of things out and and and you got all this big thing built up in your mind and before you know it when he comes he didn't find Faith he found reasoning he found doubt he found unbelief he found murmuring he found complaining he found all kinds of things but Faith he said Faith won't do that Faith looks at the word faith places itself upon that unmovable Rock God's Eternal Word Faith doesn't look at reasons Faith doesn't need a reason to believe that's deeper than what you think it is Faith doesn't need a reason to believe faith has the word amen there for it's already done it's already settled it's already the purchase price has already been paid you know some people say well I just don't know I believe God will heal but I don't know if it's his will to heal well let me tell you the will of God is his word so if the word of God is his will then the will of God is by his stripes you are healed many times people use the will of God for a copout because of their unbelief well but I believe God will but I don't know if he I believe God can but I don't know if he will well his will is his word it's the only place that faith can lay on and rest that's the only sanctuary of Faith's resting place faith comes by hearing hearing the word of God so Faith finds the word it's sanctuary of rest it moves right up to the top of that Eternal Rock Christ Jesus the word and lays down on it and rests boy I love that because we in some unrestful days and it ain't going to get any more restful it's going to be more unrestful it's like I told said back in 2020 people kept saying man I'll be glad when this year is over I'm like how you know next year is going to be any better and it ain't got any better it's got worse and it's getting worse and it's getting darker and it's getting darker all the time amen that's why you have to have faith faith is that anchor on the ship amen is down there beded down there attached to that Bedrock down there beneath it and you can't see it you can't you don't know it's there you don't know what is but you know something's hooked and a ship amen is is out there in the ocean but it sets down that anchor and it gets a real hold and storms begin to come and begin to blow against it and it just keeps moving back and forth and back and forth but it that ship can only go so far cuz that faith has anchored that ship yes amen and that's exactly what's with the believer amen storms can come against this church it can come against your family it can come against all kinds of things it can blow it can howl it can burn at whatever he wants to do but if your faith is anchored in the word you will crest every wave you will rise right above it you will go right over it he said let the winds how let the storm Shake She is safe Evermore Hallelujah she rests right there on that word that's where Faith genuine Christian faith rest is on the word amen for it knows God will prove himself Superior over every one of his enemies I that's shouting ground right there how many's faced an enemy this week amen God will prove himself Superior over every one of his enemies just hold on God's going to prove he's Superior over that God's going to prove he's in his hands God's going to prove he's got the ability to pull it off and cast it off at any moment at any time sickness can flee I believe sickness can flee and I believe it does at the preaching of the word cuz Faith comes by hearing amen I was preaching a sermon one time at brother Josh Bennett and there was a man that was sitting on the second row and he had his feet his feet were so swollen and he couldn't even tie his tennis shoes and barely could walk into church and it was all swollen his leg was swollen and at the preaching of the word he testified he said all of a sudden he realized something was different and he be to he be to worship and praise the Lord at a certain point he said I begin to realize something's different and I looked down and my feet had become normal again all the swelling was gone he said I just reached down and I tied my tennis shoes hallelujah amen what happened Faith came by hearing and Faith was there and when Faith had found an anchor place when that Spirit come by it finish the work Hallelujah that's where you want to be found with faith every service Faith to believe this is my moment what kind of service would we have right now if every question or every every need was answered right now well I believe we can have those type of services I know they did in the prophets day I know he said many times he said look at that everyone in the whole building was healed what happened Faith got in the building they for you know what they begin to forget about tomorrow and everything else they didn't care Faith was in the building they saw something real or reality and they saw the their faith begin to grow and he said look it's just almost milky in here because of of the faith that's in the building and he said what's happening people are beginning to believe that they can have their need answered they're beginning to believe that this is their service oh so there's some keys there if you want to have that kind of service that everyone's needs can be answered with we got to start believing that way we got to start believing that he's a God over every situation they ain't a devil too big they ain't a sickness too strong they ain't a situation too hard am I preaching to somebody or are we just sitting there having class they ain't a devil that's strong enough they ain't a devil that can hold you they the sickness that can hold you they ain't a devil he will show up and show he has dominion over if we have the faith to believe when he comes no matter how bad it looks has nothing to do with it no matter how defeated we feel right hello somebody going be honest with you this week I felt pretty defeated but that ain't got nothing to do with it I ain't up here preaching like I'm defeated or feeling like I'm not preaching like I'm feeling I'm defeated CU it ain't got nothing to do with it I've had bad dreams that kept me up all night woke up this morning about 3: in the morning sick at my stomach because of un some torment and spirit that have been after me in my dreams but it ain't got nothing to do with it I know there's a God that's got dominion over that I know there's a God that's greater than the spirits of the night that wants to T torment our minds and torment our hearts I know there's a God that's greater than any sin in this building this evening I know there's a God that's greater than any sickness in this building I know there's a God that's greater than any marriage trouble I know there's a God that's greater than cancer I know there's a God that's greater than any sickness name him right now our God has dominion over here I know there's a God that's great than any trouble you're going through let the winds how let the Ship Rock we are anchored in the word of almighty [Applause] God I know there's a God that's greater than any enemy that wants to come against you there's a God that's greater than any problem wants to come against your family Faith still knows it don't matter how much you look defeated hallelujah hallelujah you may feel defeated tonight but that don't mean you are woo Hallelujah you may not feel like much that don't mean you ain't come on somebody you don't may you may not feel healed tonight but that don't mean that you're not healed you may not feel delivered tonight but that doesn't mean you're not delivered when he comes and I say he's here tonight I say he's moving Among Us will he find that [Applause] Faith it's a resting place we need a resting place in Iowa that we're living in can't find it in the news can't find it in society you can't find it around you you can't find it nowhere the only place you can find rest is in the word of God that's why I'm so thankful for that word I don't understand anybody that don't want the word of God in this world we're living in Mercy I mean so much unrest is so boiling up the seas are so tural that to in such turmoil that people don't even know who they are no more amen it's so dark you know brother talked about in the guide he said people can get so lost so they forget even they they even go out of their own minds they get so lost and and Panic sets in and all of this and you know what they're trying to do why Panic is sitting in they're trying to say I'm okay it's all right I know my way I know how to get out of here I know this I've been here before and they're relying on themselves and they're trying with their best brother brandham got in that spot was a hurricane mountains on the name of it got in that spot in that storm and he said he begin to go on an Indian Death March he'd go around and come right back to the same spot go around come right back to the same spot and know I'm going to set myself this way I know it's this way and he'll go with everything with him what One Direction come right back to the same spot talk about make you want to lose your mind no wonder the world's in this condition they're lost yes sir they're so lost that they don't know if they're what gender they are they don't know what pronouns to go by they don't know they have they're having to rearr rearrange vocabulary and the dictionary and everything because they're so lost it's so dark like that little boy laying on that bed mhis Mama it's dark it's so dark I don't know where am I Mama something inside of them because why it has gotten dark there ain't no lights ain't nothing to guide them there's nothing there brother brand said I'd have been that way myself he said but a hand reached and grab me oh Jesus how many remembers of that moment when a hand reached and grabbed you and it turned you around and he said when he got turned around he was headed in the wrong direction going to go right off a cliff somewhere he said but he turned around and he caught sight of Hurricane Mountain the fog had BR back just enough to catch a a glimpse of that mountain because he knew between him and that mountain was a lifeline he said he put his hands up straight in the air and begin to go straight to that Lifeline just as hard as he could go oh come on somebody no wonder the devil don't want you praising God no wonder he don't want your hands lifted cuz he knows you're get trying to get a hold of a Lifeline Hallelujah if you can just get past it and keep walking with your hands up Wednesday night with your hands up Sunday with your hands up come on somebody and when you're in the the battle with your hands up and all of a sudden you'll hit a line I got a hold of it I got a hold of it and it's got a hold on me and it led him directly to safety I'm here to tell you if you'll keep your hands up woo and keep praising the Lord your God and keep thanking him for all that he's done you might be in a battle tonight you might be in despair tonight you might be so down you don't know what to do just lift up those hands just lift up those hands and keep walking towards that mountain cuz between here and there there's a lifeline and this might be your night to grab a hold of it Hallelujah you might have been all all disoriented before this service and you didn't know how you was going to keep your head up and Ain about your head right now it's about your hands keep them in the air and say God I'm coming to you I'm coming to you with my whole heart I'm laying it all aside and I want that Lifeline I want you let the winds how let the storm Shake she's safe ever more when you're resting upon the word this word ain't going to sink so you just lay yourself on it on the storms of life just lay yourself in there somewhere in Isaiah chapter 53 whatever just lay yourself down in there get some rest quit worrying about it quit fighting about it have faith and believe and just knock I I want you to understand the faith he's talking about is not knock because you're word knock cuz you need him to come and you know he's on the way because he will not turn me down that is my father come on somebody I I said we're not going to some unjust judge amen tonight tonight I was I came to church early and I was in there just regular old clothes waiting for my wife and S sister Ruth and sister Katie bring some church clothes and and I get this knock and I locked the bolt on it cuz I'd laid down a few minutes and so I'd gotten up and sitting there studying and the boolt was still locked I got this knock and I said who is it it's Katie I'll go away Katie you ain't going to turn me down I'm your daughter you're my this what she said you're my daddy she didn't walk off all huffy and mad cuz I told her to go away no she knew her position she knew is her position had nothing to do with her it was of God's choosing God placed her there and God put her there and God made her my daughter and she knew beyond that door that voice was not the voice of some stranger that voice was not the voice of somebody she barely knew that voice was the voice of her father and she knew he she knew his nature she knew he was just joking with her and he was just playing with her so she stands there knowing her position I'm not saying God's joking with you tonight but I'm saying you need to stand there at the door knowing who you are and you know who you are therefore you know who he is I'm a son I'm a daughter therefore that's my father in there and he's going to answer it might not be tonight but it doesn't matter I'll be here tomorrow it doesn't matter if it's tomorrow it don't matter if it's 25 years I'm going to be there cuz I know he will answer his word cuz he promised his word will not return into him void but it will accomplish that which is sent to do you're not going in there to some stranger but if we have a high priest who has come down and became one of us and he knows what it's like to Bear the things that we bear he said to you sick people I'd like to drive this home when you catch that faith that you're going to be healed every circumstance everything else all signs all symptoms can point you're dying you won't move from that it's a resting place in the sanctuary of God's word When Faith genuine genuine Faith sits there not make believe now but Faith Hope out there hoping was hoping it Hop's out there hoping it was in faith is already in looking at it saying it's done it's done that's Faith that's where Faith takes his rest in place for it knows God will never let the enemy R over the top of him he never has Faith knows that so regardless of what it looks like Noah knew that the ark would float why because it was thus sayith the Lord it wasn't some manufactured something Noah decided to dream up on his own and say you know what boys I got a good idea today we're going to build an ark what for it's going to rain what in the world are you talking about you lost your mind it's going to rain on a Wednesday night it's going to it's going to something's going to happen tonight are you crazy that wasn't Noah's resting place Noah was resting on the word brother Tim you mean we can have a wonderful service and healings and deliverances and things take place every service on a Wednesday on a Sunday yeah not because I said so it's because he said so amen so I rest upon that Daniel knew that God was going to close the lion's mouth hallelujah hallelujah the Hebrew children knew that God would stop the fire Jesus knew that God would raise him up again cuz the word said I'll leave his soul and I'll leave not leave is soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption he knew corruption said in about 72 hours and he said within 3 days I'll raise it up again it took its Eternal resting place in the sanctuary of God's word you need rest tonight go to the word not Fox News not Google listen you get a symptom and go to Google you ain't going to find no rest you read the doctor's report most of the time you're not going to find no rest but you read God's report and you go stretch out a little bit kind of take in these coverage right quick get all comfortable because I know he said it and if he said it I believe it it doesn't matter what comes my way it doesn't matter matter what happens it circumstances does not mean anything circumstances does not define who you are neither does it Define who God is God is on the throne God is God and His word is still the truth and I have faith to believe it therefore I rest let's Stand Together where's your faith do you only have faith when the preaching is how you want it he said things just as perfectly nothing hurt my feelings I got faith no he's looking sometimes to see if you got faith when stuff does hurt your feelings I got a scripture for it he's got faith whether the service went the exact he wants he wants to know if there's Faith whether the service goes how you thought it was going to go or how this one thought it doesn't matter when he comes will he find Faith don't quit quit putting that off when he comes it's when he comes when he comes in our midst will he find a little woman that Reach Out And Touch the him of His Garment will he find somebody that's there still putting a nail in the rock or in the ark will he say find somebody there still holding a rod and speaking to the waters will he find somebody is still there defying That Old King that said I'm going to burn you well do what you want to O King but as for me and my house I'm going to serve God will he find faith will he find somebody that believes no matter how many goes by the way of the Grave that has nothing to do with it I think sometimes we get the wrong impression because somebody died that they didn't have faith some people say they're anti- bunch of nonsense but that's the greatest healing that could ever happen to somebody and just because they went by by the grave does not mean that they didn't have faith brother Tim said it at that funeral sister Erica her faith took her there it's been said by our pastor before and I've used it many times because it's gave me great comfort when Jesus standing at the grave of Lazarus and he wept he wasn't weeping because of unbelief or this that and the other he done faced all kinds of unbelief but he knew he was going to bring that man back from a place of perfect health a place to never have another mind battle to never have another sin another doubt another unbelief and he's going to bring him back to live this old wretched life all over again there ain't a one of them that wants to come back here but how many of us wants to go there will he find Faith let's bow our hands Lord just been dealing with my heart father even about my own faith my own thoughts and thinking Lord you know when we go through things old ugly serpent the Old Devil tries to come and attach himself to our hurts and scars wants to put depression there anxiety and he wants to come in the M night the night time and deal with us in our subconscious wants to torment us every way he can but Lord we don't yield to him we don't yield to what he says we don't yield to his nonsense we rest upon your word Lord you promised me you promised me you would be in the fire and I know you are still God of your promise and I know Lord no matter what we go through in the situations of life you showed us very clearly you're here with us Lord Jesus let our faith just rise to such a level yes Lord there may be naysayers that wants to say all kinds of things against us may want to accuse us false accus us say all kinds of things but it matters not what they say it matters not their opinion it matters not what they feel it matters not anything what they do it only matters what the master says Lord we like that little boy as we're playing that violin and we get through with it Lord tonight we just want to look up and see if you're pleased that's all that matters and Lord if you're pleased will you please come by now and just reach down and touch hearts Lord May Faith come to such a level tonight Lord that people can grab a hold of things they wered about for years and dealt with for years and battles have been going through and God In This Moment it can just be all over with and finished because you're that kind of God lord we love you with all of our our hearts Lord we believe help thou our unbelief Lord unbelief wants to come in and reason and doubt and figure this out and that out and say this is that and that's this and mind battles of all kinds wants to attach themselves but Lord we want to be found faithful because truly you are faithful you're a faithful God we love you father let sing that all my life you have been faithful is Worship the
