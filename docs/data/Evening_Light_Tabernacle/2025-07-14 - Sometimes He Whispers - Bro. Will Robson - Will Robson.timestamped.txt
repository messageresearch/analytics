[0:01] [Music]
[0:15] It's been one of those days
[0:19] that drives me to my knees.
[0:24] There's more questions than answers.
[0:30] And all of the things
[0:34] I can't figure out
[0:38] leave me with more tears and laughter.
[0:44] I don't know
[0:47] how he's going to move,
[0:52] but I know
[0:55] he knows what I need.
[0:59] Sometimes he's water
[1:03] to the thirsty,
[1:07] sometimes his fire.
[1:10] Oh,
[1:11] consuming.
[1:14] And sometimes his voice
[1:17] is louder than thunder.
[1:24] Sometimes
[1:29] sometimes he whispers.
[1:34] [Music]
[1:37] [Applause]
[1:40] [Music]
[1:44] So I'll be listening
[1:47] while waiting on him.
[1:52] I'll choose to trust and believe.
[1:58] The same one who spoke
[2:02] the world into place is the same one who
[2:07] speaks peace to me.
[2:11] I don't know
[2:14] how he's going to move,
[2:18] but I know
[2:21] he knows what I need.
[2:25] Sometimes he's water
[2:30] to the thirsty.
[2:33] Sometimes he's fire.
[2:36] Oh, consume me.
[2:40] Sometimes his voice
[2:43] is louder than thunder.
[2:49] Sometimes
[2:54] sometimes he whispers.
[3:01] Sometimes he's water
[3:05] to the thirsty.
[3:08] Sometimes he's fire.
[3:11] Oh, consume me.
[3:15] Sometimes his voice
[3:18] is louder than thunder.
[3:25] Sometimes
[3:29] sometimes he whispers
[3:33] [Music]
[3:38] and sometimes
[3:44] sometimes he whisperers
[3:47] [Music]
[3:49] [Applause]
