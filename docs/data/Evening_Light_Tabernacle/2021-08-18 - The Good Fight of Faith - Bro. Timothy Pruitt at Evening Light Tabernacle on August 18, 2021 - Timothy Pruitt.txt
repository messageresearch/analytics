and done in jesus name amen amen turn to first timothy six and also hebrews 11. amen i would also like to add my voice of thanks to each and every one of you that has supported us during this difficult time seemed like we've heard from literally seemingly thousands around the world and how important of love has meant a lot to us and every prayer matters amen when you're going through things in your life every prayer matters and we're sure thankful for that amen but it's good to be in the house of the lord amen we got the young people that's going to be leaving this evening and we'll be following up tomorrow morning me and sister ruth will be getting on a plane about six something in the morning so to be up there and with brother andrew spencer so just be in prayer for these meetings and the lord had just come down in a special way amen i believe he does that still amen and i believe he still answers prayers and he still saves and i believe i know we got some young people that needs a real touch from god and i need a touch from him every one of us do amen every day of our lives so we're just looking unto him amen for these meetings first timothy 6 and verse 12 says fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life where unto thou art also called oh my aren't you glad to be called to eternal life and has professed a good profession before many witnesses hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so the things which are seen were not made of things which would are seen were not made of things which do appear amen we'll let you be seated i actually was looking at this thought some months ago and just kind of had it laying there lord willing will pick up again on jesus christ the same but tonight i i just felt in my heart that this was a good place to stand tonight as we're coming past the time that we've been in and and i i want to i want you to understand the world to understand that we're still fighting the good fight of faith amen our faith is not wavering our faith is not down our faith is not defeated but our faith is still in the word of god you know brother branham would talk about the good fight of faith and he would talk about the christian walk and he says remember we're not on a picnic we're in a battlefield i said many people just think that when you become a christian that's all that they need to do and that settles it forever and they are a christian and everything's going to come easy he said don't ever get that in your head he said for i become for i become a christian to fight amen to fight the good fight of faith i become a christian to get in the battle lines we're christian soldiers we we have been trained we've been brought up to know all the techniques of the enemy to know how to fortify to know how to fight the fight we can only do what the holy spirit has revealed unto us we cannot take something somebody you know if our nation goes to war they're not to take some other nation's idea or somebody else's opinion but he said just as that we're we're only to take the holy spirit and how he would direct us what ideas he would give us because he is the commanding chief of the army of the christians amen but i say we are in a battle but it will be worth it all amen we are in a war but it'll be worth every fight it'll be worth every mile it'll be worth everything that we ever go through in life's journey when we get over onto the other side amen you know i this just this week brother george and brother tim would take me and brother george brother tim winters would take me and brother tim my dad to colorado and you know we'd see some pretty country and and and go into some very to me it felt very scary situations as we would i you know i'm from the lowlands so i'm not used to a whole lot of heights and we'd go up on a place you know up in the rocky mountain national park and then also to pike's peak and 14 000 feet and it was a lot of scary highways you know we'd give brother tim a hard time about driving and be keep your eyes on the road you know don't you don't you don't have to look we'll look for you because you know in those places there would be some hairpin turns there would be some very dangerous seemingly you know i don't really understand they would build these mountains these roads on the side of the mountain and there's no guard rail and i'm riding i'm looking straight down this mountain and the road is right on the edge of the mountain it seems like just the wrong turn you'll fall off and you know many times that's like our journey in life it's a fight to get up the hill it's a fight to get to where we're going but i'll say it'll be worth the view amen when we get to that last mile and we get to that last turn which i believe with all my heart we're very close to that last turn or that last place amen but it's a struggle many times and and anxieties and fears tries to set in because you see all the dangers that are around you but it's not our eyes is not to get on our on the dangers our eye our goal is for our eyes to get on the goal amen to where we're going somebody would say it like this it says the lives of the heroes of faith in hebrews 11 had their share of hairpin turns and humdrum situations and dangerous situations but they pressed on and they did not turn back their destination heaven our destination is not pike's peak or the rocky mountain national park i mean that's a beautiful place here on earth but we got something even more grand than that something more greater than that's ever been amen our destination is heaven a city which has foundations whose builder and maker is god amen and i'm here to say again it'll be worth every battle it'll be worth every scar it'll be worth every tier it'll be worth every struggle it'll be worth every persecution it'll be worth every kind of thing every temptation that's ever come against us it will be worth it all paul would say it like this he said i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us amen if we would realize what is at the end there would be no thoughts of giving up there'll be no thoughts of turning around if we realize what is right before us we would press with everything that we have amen you know and brother brown would bring it down to the end as he said we would get to that table and he said we would look across and say god bless you brother my he said we'll have a little cry maybe don't you believe so we'll just cry a little bit for joy as we sit there at that table and then at the head of the table will come our king in his majesty he will walk down among us he'll put his arms around us he'll say you suffered much you went through much for me but he'll take that hand and he'll wipe every tear away from our eyes and he'll say now don't cry anymore it's all over it's all over he said that's why we're here isn't it want to be wonderful to feel that arm come around you and say don't cry no more enter into the joys of the lord you fought the good fight you fought the good fight he said so while we're here and we've got this opportunity let's make it a good fight oh hallelujah let's make it a real fight let's put everything that we have into it just like the old uh the patriarchs of old let's give everything we got our last breath our last hope our last everything our last bit of energy our last bit of uh of mental strength everything that we got because we know there's something very great ahead of us amen we know that it's not just a pipe uh you know pipe dreams and air castles that we're talking about but there's something real more real than what we're sitting here experiencing more real than the things that we have seen every day there's a land beyond the river and it's worth going to it's worth fighting for amen if you've already if you're a red-blooded american male uh your blood on the inside of you will get to bowling over a land that you've lived in you're born in and you want to fight and defend it how much more should a christian have a fight in them to know there's a land that don't have the things that we're going through in the and the sin and the unbelief and the worry and the fear there's a land beyond all of that and it's worth fighting for it's worth fighting to get there you say well i i don't want to fight well let me tell you something you'll fight your way to hell it's a fight no matter what amen hebrews 11 as we go through these very quickly by faith abel offered unto god it was by faith enoch it was a fight of faith listen enoch's walk was not an easy walk it was in a time even similar to what we're living in sin was abounding it was worse than it's ever been as as noah was coming it was a flood as the flood was at the very gates of the earth and it was about to overtake the earth and but yet enoch by faith amen by faith was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god translated him before because before his translation he had this testimony he pleased god and he had a fight to do that he had a fight to to take a stand he had to stand against all kinds of things that was there upon upon the earth amen and the sins and the you know why would jesus say as it was in the days of noah so shall it be amen homosexuality and perversion and everything he had to fight through it listen he had a fight to turn his head he had to fight amen to to push day after day amen but when it was worth it all because one day he went for a walk and he never returned amen there's a bride that's the same as any guards is now standing upon the earth and they're fighting every step they're fighting and they're fighting on wednesday night they're fighting on monday they're fighting on on sunday they're fighting every day every hour we're fighting but one day we're going to take a walk and we're not coming back hallelujah and we're going to walk above every sin i better ever doubt about every word and anxiety and mind battle and every spirit of hell that's trying to hold you it's going to be broke loose one of these days and this whole body's going to change just like any change but you're going to have to fight to get there i mean we can't we can't expect if our brothers had to fight that we're going to go on some flowery bit of ease and we're going to have a wonderful time in laodicea and this is going to be so easy there's not going to be no mind battles there's not going to be no spirits to haunt at you there's not going to be no anxiety no this or that in the other no no we got to fight you got to fight to get something out of service amen because there's so there's clouds that's trying to push over you and you got to fight through them he says without faith is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that digi diligently seek him by faith noah think about that man's fight to build something a boat to to come against something that had never happened before to stand there as a memorial that a flood is coming but we got a boat well god said build a certain boat well won't our boat work no he said you got to do it this way he had to fight he had he had been given a blueprint and he had to fight to stay there on that line that god had drawn for him he had to do everything he could to push aside somebody else's idea how a boat ought to be built and how it ought to be done and how this ought to take place he had to fight past all of that listen we got to fight past intellectual ideas we got to fight beyond people's ideals of what the holy ghost is and how it acts and how it ought to be our service ought to be we got to fight past all of that we got to fight by past all the critics all their naysaying and manoa had it every day nobody no doubt somebody come up there and made fun of and mocked him and if they had youtube they had youtube videos about him every day of how that you know their their services are better than the camp services and how they can do it better our boat's better in your boat our services do better things than your services do and you know these critics want to point to every mistake and every problem and everything you know they want to point to those that came to a camp and they shouted and they came back and it wasn't changed but why don't we start pointing to those who was changed [Applause] right why don't why don't we start pointing to those that that that have went to those places and and they experienced that same shouting they experience that same emotion they experience that same movement of the holy ghost and their lives have never been the same just talk to brother david and brother matthew mcgarry of their experience at camp and how they said they've got in their presence and their lives have never been what about them what about andrew glover that was born filled with the holy ghost at a camp meeting what about him and that's just a few there's thousands of them that have been in those places and changed forever but noah being warned of god of things not yet seen moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became the heir of the righteousness which is by faith amen noah had to fight to save his family what's wrong with our fathers who won't fight to save their families won't do something when their daughters are wearing things they shouldn't wear doing things they shouldn't do and their sons are doing why won't you fight for them it's a good fight of faith it will be worth it all by faith abraham when he's called to go out into a place which he should have to receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he's sojourn in the land of a promise as an estranged country dwelling in the tabernacles of isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations whose builder and maker is god through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed she had to fight to get there she had to fight pastor moodiness she had to fight pastor her attitude she had to fight pastor old age she had to fight past it all to receive the promise but it was worth it amen because she judged and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprang there even one of one of him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and multitude and as a sand which is by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promise but haven't seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed them that were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country for they that have this fight are saying i'm seeking a better place i'm not comfortable living here no more this is not where i belong i belong in another land i mean think about it drop one of y'all off on the third world country somewhere in haiti right now and see how you'll fight or afghanistan for goodness sake and see how you fight there's men we're willing some of them willing to fight to grab onto an airplane to get somewhere else we got to have that same tenacity i'll do whatever it takes i'll do whatever it takes i'm going to go on with jesus if this one don't go it ain't going to hinder me if that one don't go i'm still going on it don't matter who falls to the right who falls to the left i'm going to go on with jesus for now and truly if they had been mindful of that country from which they come out they might have had opportunity to return in other words if everything was in their mind what they left they would have turned back but they had to fight to put that out of their mind nathan and corey couldn't do that fight all those that follow him they died because they could not put egypt out of their mind out of their hearts out of their thinking out of their desires i don't listen we're called to be a separated people but we're seeing some of them among us still has a desire for laodicea has it you say how do you know can you see it on your outward appearance that your heart is still towards laodicea amen just like uh lot's wife she was looking towards sodom she looked towards it before she got there but her desires and things she started looking and desired and no doubt sodom started moving on her and and and started on her outward appearance and things and her thoughts and all that kind of stuff why she couldn't put it out of her mind she couldn't get it out of her heart you got to fight but now they desired a better country oh my that is a heavenly country wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he hath prepared for them a city oh hallelujah for by faith abraham when he was tried offered of isaac that he received the promise offered up his only begotten son who has said that in isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from which he also received him in figure by faith isaac blessed jacob and he saw concerning things to come by faith jacob when he was dying blessed both the sons of joseph and worship leaning on the top of the staff by faith joseph when he died made mention of the department of israel gave commandment concerning his bones by faith moses amen all he had to fight all the way down they had to fight to the red sea they had to fight through the walls of jericho they had to rahab had to fight and what shall we say more and time would fail to tell of gideon and bayrack and of samson and jephthah and david and samuel the prophets who through faith subdued subdued kingdoms this is what we're being brought here for to tear satan's kingdom down to subdue it to bring it powerless you say satan's kingdom becoming powerless yes it is in a people oh sure he's got power out there in laodicea but in a people he's lost power because their hearts not on his kingdom their hearts on a heavenly land they're looking for a heavenly place and they're fighting towards it and if i got to put my foot on that devil so be it and am i going to put my foot on that one so be it i'm going to overcome every one of them and push towards heaven as hard as i can go [Applause] subdue kingdoms wrought righteousness obtain promises stopped the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weaknesses were made strong waxed violent valiant in what fight turned to flight the armies of aliens women's received their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection others had trials of cruel walkings and scourgings moreover bonds and imprisonments they were stoned they were sown asunder they were tempted they were slain with a sword they wondered about in sheepskin and goatskins being destitute afflicted and tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and mountains and dens and caves of the earth and these all haven't obtained a good report through faith received not the promise god having provided something better some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect but wherefore seeing where also are compassed about with so great a cloud of fighters that have said i've done it you can do it i fought them you can fight them i overcome them you can overcome them i say goliath you can slay goliath oh hallelujah i took the line by the throat and i cut his neck off you can do it i've witnessed the healing the power of god you can witness the healing power of god i witness the overcoming power of god that changed my life from a sinner to a son or daughter of god therefore you can have that as well i received a child though i was dead you can do it as well it's a cloud of fighters of witnesses saying now you need what you need to do is lay aside every weight lay aside the sin that would so easily beset you and run with patience a racist set before you looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for joy has that was was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and it sat down at the right hand of the throne of god and i stood there at my mother's bedside and they were they told us she was going to be taking her last breaths i grabbed her by the hand i didn't know i was i didn't know she could still hear me or not didn't matter felt like that baby she could and they said that's the last thing that leaves is the hearing i said mama you get over on the other side you tell them we're coming you tell them we're not stopping preaching the full gospel of christ we're not stopping to preach faith i'm not going to back up i'm not going to turn around i'm not going to give up and say it ain't so i know and so i saw the resurrection power working her life i know he's a god who heals i know he's a god who says hallelujah amen there's a crowd of witnesses saying come on you can make it what are you going to say to them i'm coming i'm not turning around i'm not backing up i'm not giving in i'm going on with everything that i got to fight the good fight of faith it means to remain true to god to remain true to his word even in the face of opposition oh it's very easy to remain true when all things are just fine and dandy but what about in the face of opposition children at school why are you wearing a dress why is your hair so long why you look like that you all look like an old foggy oppression to remain true to god and his word in the middle of our prayer opposition and oppression and adversity it means to have an unwavering allegiance to the cause of christ in the middle of hostilities both internal and external hello somebody fighting the good fight of faith means to have a firm determination i'm going to pursue righteousness i'm going to pursue godliness i'm going to have faith and love and perseverance and gentleness at all times and in all situations wow according to first timothy 6 12 it says to fight the good fight of faith almo also means that you will by the grace of god practice the spiritual disciplines of desire patience endurance perseverance for an imperishable crown of righteousness fight the good fight of faith take hold on eternal life and we're so quick to take hold of all kinds of stuff what about eternal life we take hold of our feelings we take hold of our pride we take hold of our arrogance we take hold of our uh you know it's my world we take what about eternal life take hold on eternal life to which you are called about what you're made the good profession in the presence of many witnesses you know paul would write this to timothy i've done some study this is some of the history of it he would write this to timothy from a roman prison and timothy was a young man in charge of the church of ephesus and i'll be honest with you my name is timothy so the book of timothy is very important to me matter of fact when i went overseas for the first time to guyana and uh you know just just barely in into the ministry and went with brother danny steam and brother jackie benton and we split up in the city there jamestown i think the name of it is and we all three on a sunday went to three different churches and i'd met this pastor at the airport when they picked us up didn't really know him but just shook his hand so i'm sitting in the back getting ready to come out and i'm just sitting in the back of the audience back there waiting for him to call me up and he says he says you know he says thanks we have a special treat he said we have brother timothy oh brother timothy brother timothy he said if you know what you were going to get this morning go read the book of timothy rebuke jason oh lord maybe i need to read the book of timothy so i read the book of timothy he's a young man in charge of the church there at ephesus ephesus with a prosperous roman city a strategic position of the city created a new unique environment of trading to thrive many of the city's inhabitants were wealthy because the increased commercial activities in that busy port a few wealthy individuals from the city had converted to christianity and among them were some who trusted in their wealth and not their god and paul would instruct timothy to warn him you need to fight the good fight of faith and you need to instruct these new believers to not trust in uncertain riches but trust in god ephesus was the headquarter even also the headquarter of the fertility cult of diana ephesus city boasted of having one of the most celebrated pagan temples in the ancient world sounds a lot like our day the the temple of our artemis was one of the swirl seven wonders these pagan influence and trappings were probably the reason why paul warned timothy to fight the good fight of faith to keep guard keep your guard up to keep that which had been committed to you amen to keep the word of god near and dear to your heart so from this background of the ephesus church you can start gleaning clues in chapter six and hints of what it meant to fight a good fight of faith well based on first timothy 6 you can go through this later and you can see it all down to the scriptures as he could come down and say fight the good fight of faith one would be in first timothy six and verse the first couple verses would be to maintain a godly character to fight the good fight of faith to maintain a good godly character no matter what the circumstances are no matter who's around you oh i got a godly character but yeah it's in church but what about when you're at school or work or what behind the scenes amen paul urges faithfulness to god no matter if you found yourself a rich man or slave he actually addresses both a rich man or a slave you were to conduct yourself no matter what as a son or daughter of god put me in remembrance brother man i'm talking about the slave the son of a king how he came over here you know and he he held himself in a different manner he acted a different way he didn't look like a normal slave and the man came to buy something he's like what's the difference do you feed him different do you do you treat him different he said no he eats with the rest of me i treat him just like everybody else he said well what makes that man different he said well i actually wondered that myself but one day i found out that man is the son of a king over there in africa and he said he presents himself or conducts himself as a son of a king come on somebody amen so it does not matter where you find yourself whether you got 100 bucks in the bank or no bucks in the bank or a million bucks in the bank you need to conduct yourself where you came from as a son of a king a daughter of a king it doesn't matter if he was in his father's kingdom or if he was a slave in a foreign land he was going to maintain his position i'm a son of a king come on somebody so it doesn't matter if you got a lot of money or no money or so but some money that ain't that has no bearings on who you are right it doesn't matter if you've got a lot of land no land or you rent some land it does not change who you are another one would be to reject false doctrines to stand there and be well rooted in the word so that when you seen these things come he would instruct timothy you want to fight the fight of faith you maintain a godly character and you reject false doctrines you don't play around with them you reject them and you stand with the word no matter how many comes he would also instruct him to seek godliness with contentment it means to draw satisfaction for by living a godly life as to pose to a world filled with goods our satisfaction is not from goods our joy should never be from earthly things because all of us gonna just burn only what's done for christ will last you know i i i'll say it like this what gives me joy or or a fondness or anything is not necessarily a picture of my mom or something that she used to have or anything like that what gives me joy is to know where she's at what gives me joy is to know i'm going to see her again that's eternal i was walking out my my door there off the patio walking down the dad's there i think it was friday morning of the weekend there and just talking to the lord and i just said mom one of these days i'm going to see you walk down this road you're not coming back in that old frail body as you was walking with a little stick trying to gain strength as you would walk and she'd walk down the mailbox you'd stop as i was building that that patio and sit there and watch me and and talk and things and i said you're not coming back like that but you're coming back in a whale body young body never to be like that again i'd walk in the dad's house and brother andrew spencer would hit me with a text and he said i'm praying for you this morning he said i want to let you know one of these days your mama's going to come walking down that road mercy me i'm looking for that matter of fact i think every morning i'll have me a cup of coffee out there amen because i believe it's any day now so we need to seek godliness with contentment in other words whatever state you find yourself he's but paul would say it like this he said you know he's lived paul personally lived out his principle and his principle in his life despite the hostility and lack he experienced he kept the faith he said in philippians 4 you'd say i know how to be brought low i know how to abound and any in every circumstance i've learned the secret of facing plenty i've learned of facing hunger and abundance and need i faced it every way he had the taste of both worlds he knew firsthand abundance and he knew what deprivation was that's why he would say with confidence godliness with contentment is gain another one he would struck would say no to the greed for riches for though he would say it there again but those who desire to be rich fall into temptation into a snare into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction for the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil some people eager for money have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs so how is the money a root of all evil it's the love of money it's putting that above god well i gotta have it to survive well you'd never put it before god because god will help you survive when money can't hey we got a scriptures for that we got the woman i got it here and and be certain of god the woman who was out there picking up her last couple of sticks and her last meal and last she didn't have money she would have if she'd have had money she probably couldn't have bought anything listen i don't know where we're going in this world but it seems to be crashing pretty hard and you can have all the money you want and it's a fine fine how to do but don't put your trust in it because it can be gone in a flash i don't know what all we're going to face as i said last year people was talking about how bad year 220 was to 2020. i'd say what do you think two you think 2021 is going to be any better and for me it wasn't is 2022 going to be any better i hope we can get past this pandemic listen we're going down to destruction this world is we shouldn't be surprised this world is being set up to be burned with unquenchable fire that sounds like destruction to the whatever degree there's not going to be nothing left as i said in 2020 the only thing that will make 2021 a better year is the rapture and it can still happen 2022 25 whatever we face the only thing that's going to make that a better year is the rapture and we better be prepared to leave here and you better fight with everything you've got to get on that boat i like i said before i that would have that would have been an army to keep me off the boat with noah because i mean because brother brown talks about what you are here is what you'll be there amen i tell you if i would have been there and i saw those supernatural things happening and all of a sudden out of the woods comes these animals walking two by two going into the ark i'm in line and ain't nobody keeping me off that boat and that ought to be our attitude saints if nobody else goes i'm going if nobody else is going to make it i'm going to make it i'm going to fight with everything i got i'm gonna lay aside every way every sin that was so easy to beset me and run run listen it's time to get yourself in high gear and push towards righteousness with all your hearts push towards holiness with all your heart push towards the body change with all your hearts that's right listen the bible and god is not the god in the bible is not against acquiring wealth it's against putting your confidence in your wealth it ain't against you being rich or you being wealthy or you being poor there was all kind of those in the bible but it's against you depending on that instead of depending on god there's plenty of examples of wealthy men through the bible abraham was very wealthy isaac jacob all those down joseph was right there at the site of pharaoh moses even had wealth at one time and all the i mean think about abraham was rich enough to feed about 318 battle-trained men not counting women and children daily from his table imagine how many sheeps and goats and cattle they slaughtered the fact that he could feed all of that proved he was a very wealthy man but abraham didn't put his confidence in his wealth he put it in his god because no amount of money was going to produce a body change the only thing was going to produce a body change is having faith and an unlimited god that god would produce and say do exactly what he said he would do paul would say it like this to those who would trust in their riches flee from these things pursue righteousness godliness faith love perseverance and gentleness another place keep your life free from the love of money and be content with what you have for he has said i will never leave you or forsake you money will leave you money will forsake you but he won't oh i don't know i'm a testify i can testify to that he promised me he came down in the fire and he's been with us every step of the way hallelujah he's never left us another one he would say is contest for the faith defend the faith fight for it you know this word contend was also a word that was actually used in different places as an athletic sense or in a race it was to contend for the faith to fight the good fight of faith was to contend to take hold to to give everything you got it would say it differently in other translations it would say run your best in the race of faith compete well in another translation strive earnestly another one would say exert all your strength and energy in other words don't leave nothing reserved in the tank give everything you got and this is what i would say to the young people is going to this camp you put everything you got into it every service make it the best service make it the most important service say god i come here for one thing and that's to get something from you you're going to have to fight for it you have to fight through all the other oppressions and spirits and things for there to be the right atmosphere but if you'll fight and you'll hold on and you'll say god i'm here for you he will respond to you he will touch you he will fill you with the holy ghost got a fight paul would say it let's even portray himself in this as being spiritually engaged or involved in a marathon as an athlete he said so i do not run aimlessly i do not box as one beat in the air but i discipline my body and keep it under control lest after preaching to others i myself should be disqualified or cast away the language used by paul is also is borrowed straight from athletics paul draws parallels between an athlete athlete's discipline and spiritual discipline athletes put their body through things why the physical body because they're fighting a physical race or they're running a physical race or they're they're doing fighting a physical fight they're they're training their body to take hits they're training their body to push it just a little harder than somebody else they're putting the right food they're doing everything they can why because they want to win a little medal around their throat to have the prestige for a few years of winning a medal want to matter great but that's not what we're in the raid this race for we're not in this race to get on the other side and say look what medal i won it's not a corruptable medal that one day will be sold in an auction or found in a trash pit somewhere or hanging on a wall somewhere or some decoration that's not what we're in this race for we're in this race in this fight not for a temporary crowd but for a crown of eternal life that's something worth fighting for that's worth something that's something worth putting your energies into [Applause] your heart into your life into everything you got and lay it all aside so i got a goal in mind my goal ain't a gold medal or bronze or silver my goal is eternal life paul would talk about the athletes and the crown as we said aspiring athletes would exercise and strive against themselves and against other competitors to win the ultimate victor's prize a crown made from the wreaths of garland leaves worn on a victor's head it's called a stephanos crown was a symbolic of a symbol of victory and exaltation in the athletic athletic world the fame and glory attached to it was enough motivation for athletes to endure hardships to endure intensive training for months to win a crown of leaves how many pick flowers they don't last that long these men would put themselves through hardships you can take a vase of flowers and have it in maybe a couple of weeks at best put in the refrigerator maybe keep it a little longer these men would run they would do they'd beat their bodies into subjection they would put their hearts in it to put this little wreath of leaves around their head and their chest would puff out for a few days and you can hardly name one of them now if you can but yet these other men that were seeking a city whose builder and maker with god you can still read their names paul would say that the christians are running a better race have a better aim it's the imperishable crown of righteousness it's a better aim and a better race to make the christian fight the good fight of faith with an aim with a goal with a keeping a discipline to keep your faith alive to keep holding on to keep going when the going gets rough to seem like you can't make another step you make another step why because there's a goal in mind it's called eternal life i mean i get amazed something like goals people get in line for days sometimes to get into a store on a black friday or something special camp out do all kinds of things fight think about the fights we witnessed over toilet paper seriously let's think about that a minute just a minute over toilet paper fight and you mean i can't fight for what i'm gonna tell what i'm going to obtain you mean i can't fight to have a spiritual service that my child can experience the same god i experienced in you mean i can't fight that my children my whole household can be saved and delivered and stand for righteousness and godliness and persevere through impossible situations yeah i can fight and we're going to fight a man named benjamin beckett would say it like this he said the christian is not permitted to float leisurely down the stream of the world and so reach the haven where his soul would be he must swim against the current and he must swim for his very life the faith which he professes with his lips he must adorn with his life the christian life is a battle against principalities and powers and darkness your faith will be tested and tried you will face stiff oppositions from the world and from people around you troubles trials tribulations temptations christ had this in mind when he said the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence but the violent taketh by force yeah there's going to be violence there's going to be fights against you but there's going to be something on the inside of you when the going gets rough and and you feel like i need to give up there's gonna be something to say nope this ain't the day for that take another step forward defeat another devil you've been called for this moment this is your moment paul he was living proof of what it means to fight the good fight of faith he was stoned at lystra but continued to witness he was shipwrecked but he continued serving god he was whipped and beated and beat and humiliated by whipping five times but he kept the faith paul's faith was tried and tested but nothing could hold him back he testified none of these things moved me neither count out my life dear unto myself so that i may might finish my course with joy and the ministry i've received to the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god he was unmoved in his belief that he declared none of these things move me but i kept the faith the good fight is good because in this fight god is glorified the good fight is good because it ultimately leads to eternal life to fight the good fight means you will move and continue to fight with everything that's in you no matter what the situation another one was to guard that sacred trust this word to guard that sacred trust has been given to you to avoid pretentious arguments to continue in prayer this was the fight in other words to fight the good fight of faith means to maintain it means maintaining a godly character even in forbidden and hostile circumstances it means to reject error and to produce pursue righteousness and godliness and faith and love and perseverance and gentleness fighting the good fight means to find joy and contentment in whatever god place god has given you rather than greed and money and riches it is the life it is to live your life above reproach and to bear a good report before believers and non-believers it is to guard the sacred trust and avoid pretentious arguments that seek to unsettle your faith in christ jesus it means to fight and keep on fighting and never quit as we said we could talk about the little woman who gathered that last meal she had to fight you talking about mind battles her little child's over there dying and all of a sudden then brother brandon would describe it he said a little man with a a skin lamb skin or something laid over and come walking up to the gate and said hey get me a drink and make me some bread she had to fight that wasn't the easiest thing to look at your kid and look at this man look at your kid and look at something on the inside of her realize something else is going on here something else is moving something else he said he broke around and said how horrible it was watching her little child die inch by inch she had prayed she had waited he said i can see her take her nap wake up look at that little thin body as it's getting thinner see those great ditches in his face from hunger she could hardly stagger around herself just about a bucket of water and one handful of meal and a spoonful of oil stood between her and death he said isn't that strange how god lets his children get right down to the last moment sometimes he permits to see permits that to see what your reaction will be will you continue to fight amen he said if we cannot stand the chastisement of god then we're illegitimate and not the children of god we're born but we're born of the spirit of god and our faith in god holds on to his word no matter what she goes to the kitchen she scrapes down the bottom of the barrel she gets a handful of meal said he'll wake up in a few minutes i got to cook this so he can have his last little breakfast she went out and there began to grab that meal said i'm going to make the last bit the prophet had come towards the city with a vision and he was trying to find a yard that had a woman in it mercy jesus i wonder if god's coming tonight to see if he still finds faith is there somebody that's still believing there's somebody that's still holding on an impossible situation there's somebody that hadn't given up yet he said it come as he walking down the streets before he's walking now down the street the vision that showed him and at the same time she's coming out of her house she picks up these sticks and she was going to build a little fire and put this little meal and oil on it to make a little piece of bread and she heard a voice and she turned and she hears that she sees this old bald-headed man leaning over a gate with a piece of sheepskin wrapped around him said would you fetch me just a drink of water he said what's that god-fearing person always willing to divide what they have she looked at him he was just a little different than lots of men there was something about a christian that's different he said i can imagine her saying the voice just sounds something different to me she nodded ahead in politeness that she'd get him some water and divide it with him and then she started to go she heard the voice again and said in your hand fetch me a little morsel of bread and it's no doubt tears began to come in her eyes said this is why i was out in the yard with these two sticks i got one little handful of meal one little spoonful of oil i mixed it together and dressed it i got these two sticks to make a fire we was going to eat and die he said but first make me a cake brother brown said see seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all things will be added unto you put god first put his word first and you're going to have to fight to do that in this age that we're living in you're going to have to fight to put god's word first bring me some little cakes she said she would she turned and started the house and as she turned to go to the house she heard that voice speak again and said thus saith the lord the barrel will not be empty neither the crews run dry until the day of the lord god sends water upon the earth again she was willing but she had to fight and she put god first and god did something for her he'd say like they said many times disappointments and trouble strikes our home he said it's a blessing in disguise sometimes it's hard to see how is this a blessing why would he say that because paul said all things work together for the good to them that are the called according to the word of god so it has to be a blessing or it can't be good come on now i know we're slowing down a minute he said but many times trouble strikes our home and we wonder how is this a blessing some people might say well you're sick just because you're not right with god that don't mean that job was right with god and he was sick but many times it's god testing you putting you to a test to see what you'll do maybe let the doctor say that was for a purpose and see what you'll do we're nearing the coming of the lord god is coming for a church he never asked him question will i have a church will i have righteousness but he asked will i find faith will i find faith when i come god is putting you to test to try your faith in all her trouble and death that the door turned with one thus saith the lord she had many hindrances but she fought brother brandon would talk about the serophonician woman and we're not going to go into all of that tonight but how that she had to fight to get to him and then when she got to him he turns around and said i'm not even sent to your race that'd have been a good opportunity to say okay i'm sorry and go home but not this woman there was some fight in her she would cry out and he said i it's not rightful to give the bread amen to the dogs that have been another good opportunity to turn around and go home but there was not this woman there was some fight in her oh the preacher hurt my feelings i'm going to go home and pout and tell everybody how terribly what not this woman it was some fight in her but even the dogs get the crumbs brother brown said i'm a crumb seeker he said i want everything that god would have for me if it's just a little crumb i want it and i'm going to fight to get it whatever it is on a wednesday night or a sunday or during the week when god was there and he just puts out a little crumb you got to fight but it'll be worth it all it'll give you strength for the journey it'll give you life inside of you to take another step to push a little harder and say i'm not stopping i'm not sitting down i'm not wallowing around in my wowzy wowsy wooz but i've been called for this moment and i'm going to stand and when i've done all i can do i'm going to stand therefore and i'm going to fight think of it like this there's many services sister karen led a bunch of charges run around this church inspire a lot of people here and on the internet to see her and her place and her condition and things she was going through to fight through it i told her at the end mama i didn't know you was such a warrior she was a warrior i want to be that kind of warrior that'll fight through impossible odds that'll fight through hormones and fight through amen brain bleed six of them fight fight she fought the good fight of faith now she's in that cloud of witnesses understand just sometimes some years ago in a skit at her youth camp she stood in that banister given the charge to fight we didn't know that that was going to come to fruition but she's there tonight and if we could hear her voice she'd say even light don't you give up don't you stop don't you stop worshiping god don't you let those critics and things that tell you that ain't right and that's a bunch of holy rolling stuff and that's a bunch of fanaticism don't you stop because there is a land that is far beyond your imagination it's worth fighting for it's worth going for it's worth laying aside everything that you're going through and say i must fight if i must reign increase my courage lord how many would say lord give me something within me that no matter what i go through what challenges i face i am going to fight with everything i got to you don't know you don't know when that last hill is going to be here you don't know when that last curve's coming you don't know when that last devil's going to be in front of you and you take his head off and right behind him is the eternal gates of heaven and it will be worth it all every tear every fight every struggle every time you lay in your bed and you cried why god it'll be worth it all right you got to have some perseverance about you i'm just going to tell you you better buckle up pull up that that buckle on you brother josh the other day would say on a minister's uh a chat there he said it's time to take the sword out of the sheath and never put it back we'll lay our armor down one day but today ain't the but one day we'll lay it over on the sides of glory and lay our shields and our swords down never to fight again but until that day i'm gonna fight i'm gonna fight discouragement i'm gonna fight mind battles i'm gonna fight spirits of every kind of hell that would come against the bride of jesus christ intellectual demons that wants to rise up and say it can't be that our children can have an experience with the holy ghost i'm gonna fight against that i'm going to fight against formalism i'm going to fight against sauls stand against them and say it ain't so it wasn't so from the beginning it's worth going to i'm so thankful to have this experience to tell me that this land is real brother branham would say it like this as we bring this down to a close he said he had an experience he said it's changed me he said i can't be the same brother branham that i was he said he'd woke up from a dream and kind of kicked his head back on the headboard and put his hands behind his head thinking about his life you know here i am 50 years old and hadn't done nothing for the lord where's that put us he said all of a sudden he heard something kept saying you're just starting press the battle keep pressing the battle so i shook my head a minute i thought well probably just thinking this you know a person can get some imaginations i'd probably just imagine they imagine that and here come again press the battle keep going keep going keep going i said man maybe maybe i said that he said so he put his lips between his teeth and his hand over his mouth and there it came again just keep pressing on if he only knew what was at the end of the road it seemed like i could hear graham snellings or somebody that sang the song like this they sang it here all of you know i'm homesick and blue and i want to see jesus i would like to hear those sweet harbor bells chime it would brighten my path and vanish all fears lord let me look past the curtain of time i said you've heard it saying here at church heard somebody say would you like to see just beyond the curtain i said it would help me so much and i looked in just a moment one breath i came into a little place that was slanted and i looked back and there i was laying on the bed and i said wow this is strange he said this is before my church my sheep that i'm pastoring whether i was in this body or out whether it was a translation it wasn't like any vision i ever had i hit that little place seen so many people come running and screaming oh our precious brother and i looked and young women maybe in their early 20s they were throwing their arms around me screaming our precious brother oh mercy here come young men and the brilliance of young manhood and their eyes glistening looking like stars on the darkest night and their teeth as white as pearl and they were screaming and grabbing me and screaming oh our precious brother and i stopped and looked and i was young i looked back at my whole body laying there with my hands behind my head i said i don't understand this he said when young women were throwing their arms around me so i realized there's a mixed audience and he said i say this with sweetness and melaness of spirit man can i put your arm around a woman without a human sensation but it wasn't there there was no yesterday there was no tomorrow they didn't get tired so i've never seen such pretty women in all my life they had hair down to their waistline waistline long skirts their feet they were just hugging me and i wasn't hugged like even my own sister seeing there would hug me they were not kissing me i wouldn't was not kissing them or something he said i i don't even have the vocabulary i haven't got enough words i can say it perfection wouldn't touch it superb wouldn't describe it you just have to be there hello you just have to be there i looked this way in that way and they were coming by the thousands and here come hope my first wife she run over she never said my husband she said my precious brother when she hugged me there was another woman standing there to hug me and hope hug this woman and each one this is something different i thought it can't be as some oh and i thought my i don't ever want to go back to that old carcass again here's a man 50 years old he's not laying there with a brain bleed he's not laying there in a decrepit situation he's still got years on his life he could live for years but he said i don't want to go back to that old carcass i looked around and i thought what is this i look real good i said i can't understand it hope seemed to be like a guest of honor or something but not really different but like a guest of honor in other words she stood out something was different said i heard a voice then that spoke to me that was in the room and said this is what you preached was the holy ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter without it and i am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there there's no jealousy there's no tiredness there's no death sickness can never get there mortality can never make you old you'll never cry it's just one joy oh my precious brother they took me up and set me on a great big high place and i thought i'm not dreaming i'm looking back at my body laying on the bed i said i shouldn't set up here and one one here come women and men from side just in the bloom of you screaming oh my precious brother we're so happy to see you here i said i don't understand this and the voice said you know it's written in the bible that the prophets are together with their people i see i remember that why this is when you will be gathered with your people i said then they'll be real and i can feel them oh yes there's millions there's not that many branhams he said they're not branhams they're your converts that's the one you led to the lord i said some of them women they said and that boy said some of them women there you think are so beautiful were better than 90 years old when you led them to the lord no wonder they're screaming oh my precious brother they screamed all at once if you hadn't went we wouldn't be here and i looked around and thought well i don't get it where's jesus i want to see jesus said he's a little higher right up the way someday he'll come but you're sent to be a leader and god will come when he does he'll judge you according to what you taught first whether they go in or not we all go in according to your teaching i said oh i'm so glad that paul had to stand like this does peter have to stand like this said yes and i preached every word that they preached i never divided from it one side or the other were they baptized in the name of jesus christ i baptized them the name of jesus christ where they taught the baptism of the holy ghost i did too whatever they taught i did too then people screamed back we know that and we are resting on that we know we're going with you someday back to earth jesus will come and you'll be judged according to the word that you preached to us then if you're accepted which you will be hallelujah then you will present us to him as your trophies of your ministry and you will guide us to him all together as we gather we go back to earth to live forever i said do i have to return back now hearing his voice do i have to return back to a healthy body do i have to return back now to a wife laying beside him to children in the bed do i have to return back now yes but keep pressing on i looked and i could see people coming as far still as wanting to hug me screaming our precious brother then the voice that all that you've loved never loved will be god will give it to you he's seen his horse and he's seen his little dog i felt myself move from that little beautiful place and looked around and said are you awake honey she was still asleep and i thought oh god help me never let me compromise with one word let me stay straight right on that word and preach it i don't care what comes or goes how many souls rise how many sons of kiss rise how many this or that or another lord let me press with all my heart into that place [Applause] hallelujah i've never got to experience that but that there's good enough for me and if he had that desired vision in there i have that same desire god let me press with everything i got into that place do you have that same desire tonight i wonder how many would say lord i want to fight the good fight of faith i want to pick up my sword again i want to fight a little harder i want to go a little harder i want to give more of my energies to you i want to give more of myself in service unto you that'd be your desire tonight can you stand to your feet and say lord that's me i want to fight a little harder i want to go a little harder father with all my heart with all my heart with all my heart i don't want to hold back none lord i want to go with all that's in me hallelujah oh hallelujah he said all fear of death is now gone as i say this with my bible before me i got a little boy about four years old to be raised nine-year-old girl teenager i'm thankful for this turned the way of the lord god let me live to bring them up in the admonition of god above that the whole world seems to scream
