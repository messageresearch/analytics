[54:06] how long you've been a Christian there
[54:09] are things that can be Rewritten in your
[54:12] life things that God can deal with
[54:16] and adjustments that can be made and if
[54:19] you're not a Christian today I would
[54:22] pray for you you would leave this

[54:26] that you would know that your names are
[54:28] written in heaven before the foundation
[54:30] of the world that that Revelation become
[54:33] real to you that you are chosen of
[54:37] God may he speak to you today he's our
[54:41] healer as brother Tim winter sung so
[54:44] beautifully a moment ago Jehovah
[54:47] Rafa and I want you just to realize he
[54:50] can heal your
[54:52] situation that there is no problem that
[54:54] is too big for our God
[54:57] it doesn't matter whether it's age
[54:59] related situations or whether you're
[55:02] young it doesn't matter if it's a
[55:04] teenage problem a marriage problem a
[55:07] financial situation this God cares about
[55:12] you and your need he's a personal
[55:16] God I was just speaking with brother
[55:19] Andrew
[55:20] Glover and he just kind of told me this
[55:22] story as he just came from Brother bcll
[55:26] where he was spend a little time with
[55:28] him brother bisc just reiterated some
[55:31] experiences with him that he had with
[55:34] brother bradam and remember to pray for
[55:37] brother Bisal he'll be 90 this year and
[55:39] you know age is not kind to any of us so
[55:44] remember him in prayer but he just he he
[55:47] just shared with him said you know we
[55:50] were up among the Indians and there in
[55:53] British Colombia and some of them were
[55:55] not able to get help from the government
[55:58] cuz they didn't know their date of birth
[56:00] and they didn't know their um even you
[56:04] know any of their personal informations
[56:08] of when when they were born and and um
[56:11] and things that that was needed to fill
[56:13] out the forms for the for the assistance
[56:16] and they were living in extreme poverty
[56:19] because of it brother brandham sat down
[56:22] with them one by one and told them their
[56:25] date of birth
[56:27] when they were born filled out their
[56:29] forms where they could get the
[56:32] assistance that they needed you know
[56:34] what that tells me that God is a
[56:36] personal God he knows when you were born
[56:40] he knows exactly what your situation
[56:43] is he knows the answer to your problem
[56:47] the god that we serve is a big God but
[56:51] he wasn't so big that he just remained
[56:53] in heaven aloof from all of us but he
[56:56] become one of us to give his life on our
[57:00] on our behalf to rewrite our lives so
[57:04] let him rewrite your life today let him
[57:07] speak to you in a special way as We
[57:10] Worship the Lord together as brother

[58:37] where we would be if it wasn't for the
[58:39] mercy of God you I'm so grateful when we
[58:43] think about Mercy though we don't think
[58:46] about what we can do and get by with as
[58:50] far as wrong and sin and all of that and
[58:54] that God will be merciful to us
[58:56] a person that's really experienced that
[59:00] it changes their life changes their life
[59:03] about Grace about forgiveness about
[59:06] Mercy we're so grateful for that today
[59:09] had a little glitch in my computer so I
[59:11] won't be singing it right
[59:13] now turn with me to U Genesis CH 3:
[59:23] 6 I know out in the old west a lot of
[59:26] guys used to carry U two six guns I
[59:30] carry two
[59:33] iPads cuz I was fixing to walk out just
[59:35] a minute ago and my other one went crazy
[59:38] so I've got another one then if that
[59:41] goes down I've got it on my
[59:43] phone
[59:45] so God bless you we certainly appreciate
[59:48] the opportunity to get to be with you
[59:49] today and once again with my dear friend
[59:52] brother Tim I'm really sorry brother
[59:54] Timothy couldn't be with this service
[59:57] today I was looking so forward to seeing
[59:58] him again
[1:00:00] too Genesis 3:
[1:00:03] 6 I want to speak to you today by the
[1:00:06] help of the Lord on
[1:00:08] dressed for the
[1:00:12] occasion and when the woman saw that the
[1:00:14] tree was good for
[1:00:17] food that it was pleasant to the eyes
[1:00:20] and a tree to be desired to make
[1:00:24] one
[1:00:26] wise she took the fruit thereof and did
[1:00:29] eat and gave also unto her husband with
[1:00:31] her and he did eat and the eyes of them
[1:00:35] both were opened and they knew that they
[1:00:38] were
[1:00:39] naked and they sowed fig leaves together
[1:00:44] and made themselves aprons verse
[1:00:48] 21 now that's what they
[1:00:51] did this is what God
[1:00:53] did unto Adam also so and to his
[1:00:58] wife did the Lord God make coats of
[1:01:04] skins and closed
[1:01:08] them so they covered thems with one
[1:01:12] thing botney life could not bleed could
[1:01:16] not suffer but God closed him with
[1:01:20] something else the first time that we
[1:01:23] see the word close or CL clothed used in
[1:01:27] the
[1:01:29] Bible and in this case the occasion was
[1:01:35] Redemption let's bow our heads
[1:01:38] together Heavenly Father we so love you
[1:01:41] today we're truly thankful we're blessed
[1:01:45] people to be able to gather together
[1:01:48] once again in the the house of God we're
[1:01:51] grateful Lord that we also realize the
[1:01:54] house of God is not just this
[1:01:57] building but it's this mystical body
[1:02:00] that's sitting here today that
[1:02:02] individually we've been baptized into
[1:02:05] Christ Jesus for that we are so thankful
[1:02:09] may you take the service today may you
[1:02:11] help us Lord you know the needs of all
[1:02:13] your
[1:02:14] children father I pray if there's a need
[1:02:17] that lays out of the confines that I've
[1:02:21] studied today make me sensitive that I
[1:02:25] would be able to go out maybe to a
[1:02:28] little straying sheep Lord maybe to one
[1:02:31] that's heartbroken or heavy lad it may
[1:02:35] not be but five words or 10 but it would
[1:02:38] be something that would touch them yes
[1:02:41] Lord Make Me sensitive I pray father not
[1:02:44] only me but help the people here today
[1:02:48] help them to realize that the preacher
[1:02:49] does not bring a service in his
[1:02:51] briefcase or on his iPad but a great
[1:02:54] portion of the service so be determined
[1:02:57] by them
[1:02:58] too we are so needy but our God is so
[1:03:02] great and so wonderful would you speak
[1:03:04] to us today Father in the name of the
[1:03:06] Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints
[1:03:10] said God bless you you may be
[1:03:20] seated all of us of course can
[1:03:24] appreciate what God did for Adam and Eve
[1:03:27] there in the Garden of
[1:03:29] Eden we're all aware and very common to
[1:03:34] us as far as certain clothes that we
[1:03:38] wear to certain things some of you all
[1:03:41] were at the wedding that we had
[1:03:44] yesterday and as I looked out and saw
[1:03:48] the people when I first got there and
[1:03:50] watching them continue to arrive and I
[1:03:54] seen men that I knew were not really
[1:03:57] comfortable in a
[1:04:00] suit you know we just have that look
[1:04:03] about us don't we when you were just you
[1:04:05] know U some of them did not have a suit
[1:04:08] on but they had on a dress shirt and a
[1:04:10] tie because the way they looked at it
[1:04:14] there was something about the
[1:04:17] occasion that they felt like it would be
[1:04:20] worse
[1:04:22] inconveniencing thems in order to to
[1:04:25] dress in a way that would suit the
[1:04:29] occasion now had I walked out in my
[1:04:32] favorite clothes my favorite clothes are
[1:04:35] blue jeans a T-shirt and a pair of
[1:04:39] Sketcher
[1:04:41] shoes but if I would have walked out
[1:04:44] that way and I would have come out and
[1:04:45] Stood Beside brother Tim and those of
[1:04:48] you that were there and the other people
[1:04:49] that were there and they would have
[1:04:51] looked at me and thought what in the
[1:04:53] world is the matter with that
[1:04:56] preacher why would he wear well what if
[1:04:59] I would have said well these are my
[1:05:01] favorite clothes Carol told me the other
[1:05:04] day I've got a t-shirt that I wear down
[1:05:06] the basement whenever I'm staining and
[1:05:08] refinishing and whatever I'm doing down
[1:05:10] there and it's got two or three holes
[1:05:12] right up here where the buttons are it's
[1:05:14] got two or three holes right here she
[1:05:16] said you're going to have to get rid of
[1:05:17] that shirt I said that's one of my most
[1:05:20] favorite
[1:05:21] shirts it's just getting broke in she
[1:05:24] said how long you had it 20 years years
[1:05:27] 25 but to be comfortable is not always
[1:05:33] right now leoda is very comfortable in
[1:05:38] what they are
[1:05:40] wearing as a matter of fact they're
[1:05:43] wearing
[1:05:44] nothing in the eyes of God they are
[1:05:48] naked and yet they feel like they are
[1:05:52] dressed for the occasion of the marriage
[1:05:57] supper so if we would have had the
[1:05:59] wedding yesterday and we would have went
[1:06:01] through it all and then we go over to
[1:06:02] the place where we're going to have the
[1:06:04] reception and there's people in there
[1:06:07] that's not even got any clothes on at
[1:06:10] all would you all have sat down with
[1:06:12] them well how you doing been a while
[1:06:14] since I've seen you so good to see you
[1:06:16] nice to see
[1:06:19] you you know the sad part about Leo deia
[1:06:23] is she's totally convinced
[1:06:26] she's
[1:06:27] closed Rapture Ready Now may I say when
[1:06:31] I refer to Leo deia I'm not just talking
[1:06:34] about denominational
[1:06:36] people the sad part about it is we've
[1:06:38] got folks sitting in message churches
[1:06:41] that are as Leo deia as they can be
[1:06:45] they're blind wretched miserable poor
[1:06:50] and
[1:06:50] naked but yet the way they look at it
[1:06:53] well I I believe God sent a prophet but
[1:06:55] I I believe that you know I believe
[1:06:58] every word he said yeah and he said you
[1:07:00] could do that and that's just being able
[1:07:02] to
[1:07:04] read so if we're going to meet the Lord
[1:07:08] and we believe of course that we're
[1:07:09] living in that time when the Rapture is
[1:07:12] going to be we certainly do not want to
[1:07:14] meet him in the way that Adam and Eve
[1:07:17] met him it was the first time that they
[1:07:21] had ever
[1:07:22] experienced this type of emotion yeah
[1:07:26] every day prior to this we don't know
[1:07:28] how long that they had lived in the
[1:07:30] Garden of Eden in this perfect
[1:07:33] setting but every day in the evening
[1:07:36] Papa would come down
[1:07:38] yes and the little fire would start
[1:07:41] burning and the bushs would start moving
[1:07:43] and he had settle down and Adam would
[1:07:46] grab her by the hand and say sweetheart
[1:07:49] it's time for us to go up to church and
[1:07:53] worship and their Church wasn't a place
[1:07:55] like this of course but a Cathedral of
[1:07:59] trees and every day they did this for
[1:08:03] thousands of years maybe who knows we
[1:08:05] don't know for
[1:08:06] sure but on this
[1:08:09] day God showed
[1:08:11] up but Adam wasn't in
[1:08:14] church God showed up but Eve wasn't in
[1:08:19] church now the omnipotence and
[1:08:21] omnipresence of God he knew where they
[1:08:24] were
[1:08:26] but he wanted to give them an
[1:08:28] opportunity to come
[1:08:30] clean and be reckoned with him so the
[1:08:34] prophet said one of the saddest
[1:08:35] scriptures in the Bible was God running
[1:08:39] can you imagine God running God running
[1:08:43] through the Garden of Eden
[1:08:45] screaming
[1:08:47] Adam
[1:08:50] Adam God may have passed the bush that
[1:08:54] he was H hiding by behind four or five
[1:08:57] times but just went right by as if
[1:09:01] though he didn't know where he
[1:09:03] was
[1:09:05] [Music]
[1:09:06] Adam where are you
[1:09:09] son finally he mustered up enough
[1:09:12] courage to
[1:09:13] say I'm over here
[1:09:16] Lord I hid
[1:09:19] myself because I'm
[1:09:23] afraid most of and small
[1:09:27] children started
[1:09:29] experiencing that
[1:09:31] emotion
[1:09:33] fear but this man is an adult maybe
[1:09:36] hundreds of years old thousands of years
[1:09:38] old we don't know and the first time he
[1:09:42] experienced it it must have been such
[1:09:45] trauma that it was
[1:09:48] overwhelming he felt so
[1:09:52] afraid so his response was instead of
[1:09:56] coming out to meet
[1:09:58] God the way You' done every day before
[1:10:02] was to hide right he didn't know
[1:10:05] anything else to
[1:10:06] do just a reaction in Fallen man to hide
[1:10:13] that's so he takes her by the hand and
[1:10:16] they go over and they
[1:10:21] hide his heart
[1:10:23] racing his blood pressure
[1:10:26] fluctuating flushing in his
[1:10:29] skin her standing behind him
[1:10:34] terrified of the very same
[1:10:37] being that there's waiting for him the
[1:10:39] day before with
[1:10:46] anticipation so the prophet said I can
[1:10:49] imagine seeing that portal Eve when she
[1:10:52] looked at Adam her long blonde hair
[1:10:56] hanging down her at her back those
[1:10:58] bright blue eyes that look like the
[1:11:02] skies where God had made them tears
[1:11:06] pouring down mixing with the blood on
[1:11:09] the
[1:11:11] garments now God knew that what they had
[1:11:13] done was an appropriation of their own
[1:11:17] works but it would never stand up in the
[1:11:21] presence of
[1:11:23] God so they took fig leaves and begin to
[1:11:27] sew them together and we know that they
[1:11:31] put the Fig leaves around the guilty
[1:11:36] part of their
[1:11:38] Anatomy which was not their
[1:11:43] mouths Adam and Eve did not come out
[1:11:46] from behind the bushes with a covid-19
[1:11:49] mask
[1:11:52] on because they didn't need a
[1:11:56] mask but they covered what to them was
[1:12:01] the guilty part of their
[1:12:03] sin and if you look at the Hebrew word
[1:12:06] it is a loin
[1:12:10] cloth not a
[1:12:15] mask so
[1:12:19] God got a
[1:12:24] lamb and killed that
[1:12:27] lamb and took the skin off of
[1:12:31] it and throw it in behind the bushes and
[1:12:35] said Put it
[1:12:39] on and come
[1:12:46] out the prophet
[1:12:49] said eve and Adam his strong body body
[1:12:52] caught her she leaned over on his bosom
[1:12:56] there are the tears mingling
[1:12:59] falling as it run through the sheep
[1:13:02] skins blood dripping
[1:13:05] down so here they come out in the
[1:13:08] presence of God and they're afraid to
[1:13:10] look at him they're ashamed they're
[1:13:12] embarrassed they're
[1:13:15] humiliated but at
[1:13:16] least they were
[1:13:19] properly
[1:13:22] dressed I'm so glad when I came to the
[1:13:24] Lord Lord so many many years
[1:13:29] ago I wasn't raised in church and didn't
[1:13:31] know anything about church I had to ask
[1:13:34] my mama how to even get saved I didn't
[1:13:38] know
[1:13:39] how but when I went up to that Altar and
[1:13:42] that little Pentecostal
[1:13:44] church I found myself being
[1:13:48] clothed in a
[1:13:50] cloak of
[1:13:52] repentance and sorrow right and sadness
[1:13:57] how many knows what I'm talking about
[1:13:58] today so even before you met him he
[1:14:03] provided for you a cloak that would be
[1:14:07] able to bring a broken and a contract
[1:14:11] spirit in his presence why that's what
[1:14:14] he requires that's right and we realize
[1:14:18] as we go on in time we're preaching more
[1:14:20] and more and more to educated message
[1:14:24] people yeah that whenever a preacher
[1:14:26] goes to start quoting a quote they can
[1:14:29] just about finish it for you but the
[1:14:32] disadvantage to that is it's not always
[1:14:35] what we know oh I know I know I know I
[1:14:38] should do this I know I should do that I
[1:14:40] know I should do that but knowledge
[1:14:43] alone will never set us free that's
[1:14:46] right we have to take what we know and
[1:14:49] apply it to our
[1:14:52] lives look the prophet said now he says
[1:14:56] you have to
[1:14:58] depart out of my presence can you
[1:15:01] imagine that they heard a tone in God's
[1:15:05] voice they' never heard it
[1:15:09] before every day prior to this the
[1:15:12] prophet just dramatizes it for us and
[1:15:14] said Papa would come down and say
[1:15:18] children have you enjoyed your stay on
[1:15:20] Earth
[1:15:21] today and they'd say oh papa
[1:15:25] it's been so
[1:15:27] wonderful how was everything oh
[1:15:30] everything was fine it was so
[1:15:34] wonderful and he said I've come down to
[1:15:37] kiss you good
[1:15:39] night so he would lay Adam down in the
[1:15:42] Garden of
[1:15:43] Eden and he would lay Eve down at his
[1:15:46] arm so he'd stretch his arm out maybe
[1:15:48] something like this and God would lay
[1:15:51] her down on his
[1:15:52] arm and papa would reach over
[1:15:57] I
[1:15:58] Adam I love
[1:16:02] you I'll see you
[1:16:05] tomorrow and Eve say papa you going to
[1:16:08] kiss me good
[1:16:11] night come here
[1:16:14] e good night my
[1:16:16] children I love you so
[1:16:23] much you imagine Miss he would step back
[1:16:27] and the angels of God would look at him
[1:16:29] and say
[1:16:31] Papa he looks just like
[1:16:37] you Papa's heart would
[1:16:42] race because they had everything they
[1:16:46] needed in this
[1:16:48] dispensation of
[1:16:52] Innocence but now they hear the rais
[1:16:55] in Papa's voice that they never heard
[1:16:58] before come
[1:17:02] out you know people wonder sometimes why
[1:17:05] that a preacher will maybe have to raise
[1:17:07] his
[1:17:08] voice maybe he'll have to even when he's
[1:17:11] counseling them have to get a little bit
[1:17:13] Stern with them and have to say things
[1:17:16] that he doesn't even want to say and the
[1:17:19] tenor of his voice may have to be in
[1:17:22] such a way that it actually breaks his
[1:17:24] heart heart to have to say it but what
[1:17:28] is it that determines
[1:17:31] that you and
[1:17:34] I you see it was not that God
[1:17:38] wanted to be upset that
[1:17:42] day God never wanted to have to tell
[1:17:45] them get
[1:17:49] out
[1:17:52] leave do you hear me me I
[1:17:57] said
[1:18:04] leave the prophet said when he stole
[1:18:09] it did he come down before
[1:18:13] them and he stood
[1:18:17] there looking at such
[1:18:21] love and he said I promise
[1:18:26] you I will bring you
[1:18:34] back aren't you
[1:18:40] glad and then God does something so
[1:18:44] strange he
[1:18:45] turns and he speaks to the
[1:18:50] woman to the
[1:18:53] woman
[1:18:55] and he promises through
[1:18:57] her will come forth the
[1:19:03] Redeemer notice brother Bren goes on to
[1:19:05] say I can see Eve and Adam their arms
[1:19:08] around one
[1:19:09] another moving out like this them old
[1:19:13] sheep skins flopping against their legs
[1:19:17] bloody
[1:19:18] beating brother R claps his hands
[1:19:22] together I can see that all space which
[1:19:25] was God which had no beginning of days
[1:19:27] or ending of years I can see all that
[1:19:30] great space begin to move together like
[1:19:32] this coming down to a funnel
[1:19:38] shape as he be to eye that little couple
[1:19:41] going down through the garden the bloody
[1:19:43] skins flopping against their leg he
[1:19:46] couldn't stand
[1:19:48] it oh it moved down it moved down the
[1:19:52] very heart of God and spelled
[1:19:55] l o
[1:19:59] v
[1:20:02] e so here he come in the act of
[1:20:07] condensation and he founded himself down
[1:20:09] from all this great space of time and he
[1:20:13] just kept getting smaller and smaller
[1:20:15] and smaller and smaller even the very
[1:20:17] symbol he came in was a sign of
[1:20:20] reconciliation this is what I must
[1:20:23] do to get you back I will become from
[1:20:26] the great Eternal I will come down and
[1:20:29] embody
[1:20:31] myself in a body of
[1:20:36] time
[1:20:39] Hallelujah and he called them back and
[1:20:41] said I'm going to put between imity
[1:20:43] between your seed and Satan's seed this
[1:20:47] was done at Calvary when God himself
[1:20:50] came down through a woman born of a Virg
[1:20:55] virgin now listen how God looked at this
[1:20:58] human
[1:20:59] love when God looked down and seen that
[1:21:02] love of a human being it was so
[1:21:06] great he couldn't stand it
[1:21:12] himself I love the Song of
[1:21:15] Solomon it has been called by the Jews
[1:21:18] for many
[1:21:20] Millennium the holy of
[1:21:23] holies the Song of Solomon the holy of
[1:21:27] holies they will not allow their
[1:21:29] children to read it until they're adults
[1:21:33] because of the contents of the
[1:21:36] book and one of my favorite verses there
[1:21:40] is when the bridegroom looks at the
[1:21:44] bride and he says I have come into my
[1:21:48] garden and there they are together in
[1:21:51] this
[1:21:52] space and she looks at him and when she
[1:21:55] does he says oh my
[1:21:59] sister my fair
[1:22:01] one my
[1:22:04] undefiled turn your eye away from
[1:22:09] me for your ey has caught
[1:22:13] me and the word that Solomon used there
[1:22:16] in the Hebrew it's it's it's a
[1:22:19] phenomenal
[1:22:21] word it's that the word that he chose to
[1:22:24] use caught me when I looked at your eye
[1:22:28] you captured
[1:22:30] me I have no
[1:22:33] will to resist
[1:22:36] you oh children I
[1:22:39] know I know we want to go to heaven so
[1:22:42] bad we long for the Rapture every day
[1:22:45] don't
[1:22:47] we but that's only half the story yes
[1:22:51] sir the other half is
[1:22:55] can you imagine the
[1:22:57] anticipation that he has for you this
[1:23:02] morning we know and understand by the
[1:23:04] teaching of the scriptures and of the
[1:23:06] message of the hour that when the saints
[1:23:08] of God pass beyond this life and go into
[1:23:10] the sixth Dimension they actually do not
[1:23:12] go into the seventh where God is Paul
[1:23:15] has never yet seen the Lord Jesus Peter
[1:23:19] did not go directly into where Jesus was
[1:23:22] nor did Brother randam no do any of the
[1:23:24] same of this day but they're under the
[1:23:26] altar or as he calls it in the sixth
[1:23:29] Dimension there they are waiting it
[1:23:32] would be
[1:23:33] Unbecoming for them to see him as he's
[1:23:36] still acting out the part of the
[1:23:39] mediatorial work in the office of high
[1:23:42] priest that's right right so when his
[1:23:46] bride sees him we will all see him at
[1:23:50] once when Paul catches his first glimpse
[1:23:54] of the King it'll be the same time you
[1:23:56] see him and we all will gather there
[1:24:00] together and stand before him Hallelujah
[1:24:03] not as a high priest but as our great
[1:24:06] resurrected king of kings and
[1:24:10] Lord of
[1:24:13] lords look at how God tried to relate to
[1:24:17] this love it was so great that he
[1:24:19] couldn't stand it himself and he
[1:24:22] said I'll come
[1:24:25] yeah and go
[1:24:27] to now you know what Adam
[1:24:31] did God had made man on the sixth day of
[1:24:35] his creation so he was the finale of
[1:24:38] God's
[1:24:39] work then God s Sanctified and hallowed
[1:24:43] the seventh
[1:24:45] day which was 7,000 or Thousand
[1:24:49] Years God entered into his millennium
[1:24:55] right when Adam was placed in the Garden
[1:24:57] of
[1:24:58] Eden and Adam's sin called God out of
[1:25:04] his
[1:25:05] Millennium and God stopped
[1:25:10] it don't you understand why we cannot
[1:25:14] jump from the sixth Dimension and go
[1:25:16] straight into the Eighth
[1:25:19] Day the Millennium must be lived out yes
[1:25:25] it has never yet been lived out but it
[1:25:28] will
[1:25:29] be I said it will
[1:25:32] be so God simply put it on hold the fall
[1:25:38] of Man called God out of his Millennium
[1:25:44] now in the Millennium of course Ezekiel
[1:25:46] 44-48 the temple will be rebuilt it will
[1:25:49] be all there for Memorial and all that
[1:25:51] you've read it I know and I know brother
[1:25:53] Tim has telling to you many times but in
[1:25:56] the seventh day the Heathen which has
[1:25:58] never heard the gospel will be raised
[1:26:02] not people that's heard it and turned it
[1:26:04] down and get a second chance only those
[1:26:07] who's never heard it remember Psalm
[1:26:10] whenever he said sit thou at my right
[1:26:12] hand until I make thine enemies thy foot
[1:26:16] stol and it will be there of course that
[1:26:19] the Prophecies of Isaiah of Zachariah
[1:26:21] and many of the Messianic prophecies I'm
[1:26:24] under the reign of the son of David in
[1:26:26] the Millennium will be lived out upon
[1:26:29] the thy Throne God told David by the
[1:26:31] fruit of thy body will I set upon thy
[1:26:35] Throne there we will reign in glorified
[1:26:39] bodies that will be the other people
[1:26:40] living on the earth in human bodies can
[1:26:44] you imagine they will live for a
[1:26:45] thousand years and at the end of that
[1:26:47] Thousand Years there's no devil there is
[1:26:50] no devil Bound by a chain of
[1:26:53] circumstance there's no demons
[1:26:55] infiltrating people's minds there's no
[1:26:57] cigarettes there's no drinking there's
[1:26:59] no Honky Tonks there's no bars there's
[1:27:01] no televisions there's no vow there's
[1:27:03] nothing there and at the end of that
[1:27:06] Thousand Years them people will make up
[1:27:09] their mind they hate Jesus
[1:27:14] Christ can you imagine living on the
[1:27:16] earth with people and glorified bodies
[1:27:18] so if you decide you want to go on the
[1:27:20] other side of the earth you think about
[1:27:22] it and go you're gone they see you
[1:27:24] disappear they see you you've not aged
[1:27:27] one day you're there in Eternal
[1:27:30] bodies and they've lived under this
[1:27:33] domain and remember if they don't come
[1:27:34] up at the Feast of Tabernacles to
[1:27:36] worship the sons of God in full
[1:27:38] manifestation of adoption they will not
[1:27:41] allow any rain on their crops God's
[1:27:44] really picky about us going to church
[1:27:47] sir he's going to be pretty picky about
[1:27:49] it in the Millennium so if folks don't
[1:27:51] go to church in the Millennium them
[1:27:53] people that's living outside there if
[1:27:55] they don't go to church the sons of God
[1:27:57] will be the magistrates and and then the
[1:27:59] governors over the Earth and God will
[1:28:02] relate to them you know our son go over
[1:28:04] there and tell them people in Babylon
[1:28:06] they wouldn't a church last Feast of
[1:28:08] Tabernacles tell them because of that
[1:28:10] they're not going to get no rain for a
[1:28:13] while that's what your Bible
[1:28:15] says now why because God wants to
[1:28:19] fulfill every word well why not jump
[1:28:21] just from the church e on over to the A
[1:28:24] day no he's perfect in all of his
[1:28:27] promises and remember we must be dressed
[1:28:31] in the proper
[1:28:33] attire as I stood there yesterday beside
[1:28:35] your pastor and I watched each one of
[1:28:37] the the groomsmen come in and I watched
[1:28:39] the Bridesmaids and the little girls and
[1:28:42] how cute they all were but there's one
[1:28:44] thing I noticed and those of you that
[1:28:45] were there and you've noticed it as well
[1:28:47] and other weddings that you've seen that
[1:28:49] was only one beautiful young lady
[1:28:54] that had on the wedding
[1:28:58] garment there were friends there were
[1:29:00] families there was preachers there was
[1:29:02] all types of other people the wedding
[1:29:05] coordinator so on and so on and so on
[1:29:08] but only one young lady had on oh
[1:29:12] Hallelujah there's churches churches
[1:29:15] Brides brides churches churches Brides
[1:29:18] but there must come one that has both
[1:29:21] mechanics and Dynamics
[1:29:24] oh there's many that have attended
[1:29:26] church today in different parts of the
[1:29:28] world and the Earth and they'll say oh
[1:29:30] we're the Church of the Living God we
[1:29:32] the bride show us the clothes you wear
[1:29:35] we'll tell you if you're the bride or
[1:29:37] not I ain't talking about now just the
[1:29:39] natural clothes I'm talking about the
[1:29:41] spiritual CLA of the word and remember
[1:29:44] the attire changed in every age so God
[1:29:49] would send a certain messenger and say
[1:29:51] this is the cause of the word that
[1:29:54] messenger would put together what God
[1:29:56] wanted the people to be clothed in in
[1:29:59] that hour but in the last days the
[1:30:02] seventh angel didn't have a certain
[1:30:04] message but he was to gather all the
[1:30:07] Loose Ends the ends of Luther the ends
[1:30:09] of Wesley the ends of Pentecost is that
[1:30:12] right why he's making a special garment
[1:30:16] for that resurrected bride because Paul
[1:30:19] can have no Resurrection if God don't
[1:30:23] complete a bride in this age I know you
[1:30:26] already know it but I'm here just to
[1:30:27] remind you of things that you already
[1:30:29] know but let me just remind you the Lord
[1:30:32] God is Not anxious he's not nervous he's
[1:30:35] not worried about the bride not being
[1:30:38] ready as a matter of fact he knows she
[1:30:40] will be there's not enough devils in
[1:30:43] Hell the devil ain't got enough power
[1:30:46] there's not enough smoking there ain't
[1:30:48] enough drinking there ain't enough
[1:30:49] alcohol there ain't enough lying it will
[1:30:53] come to pass last because Almighty God's
[1:30:57] reputation is at hand St if God don't
[1:31:01] produce a bride that'll be able to call
[1:31:04] forth the resurrection of tens of
[1:31:07] millions of saints of God God's
[1:31:09] reputation will be
[1:31:13] ruined yes
[1:31:15] sirl but don't
[1:31:17] worry I'll tell you how worried the Lord
[1:31:20] is about
[1:31:22] this he said it 2,000 years ago let not
[1:31:27] your heart be troubled you believe in
[1:31:30] God believe also in me for in my
[1:31:32] father's house are many mansions or
[1:31:35] Tabernacles if it were not so I would
[1:31:38] have told you I go away to prepare a
[1:31:41] place for you and if I go away to
[1:31:44] prepare a place for you I will come
[1:31:46] again and receive you unto myself that
[1:31:49] where I am there you may be also now
[1:31:52] he's really concerned is he he's really
[1:31:55] tore up afraid that the powers is going
[1:31:57] to get so bad uhuh no that's exact
[1:32:00] opposite you remember when the children
[1:32:01] of Israel was right up to the brink of
[1:32:04] going over in the land and they saw all
[1:32:06] the cities and they saw all the things
[1:32:08] that went on little did they know years
[1:32:12] later whenever Rahab was told that the
[1:32:15] the children of Israel was coming in and
[1:32:17] they'd sent some Messengers down there
[1:32:20] and Rahab begin to testify of what they
[1:32:24] had heard 40 years ago and you know what
[1:32:27] it was they was terrified of the
[1:32:29] children of Israel they were scared to
[1:32:32] death but remember the prophet said the
[1:32:34] the Devil's weapon against you listen to
[1:32:37] this his weapon against you is to get
[1:32:41] you to doubt your weapon it's not like
[1:32:45] he's got a great big armor in he's got
[1:32:47] all this great power and he's got all
[1:32:50] this no he has one simple thing to give
[1:32:53] get you to doubt your weapon he don't
[1:32:57] have to have power he does not have to
[1:32:59] have a lot of weapons all he has to have
[1:33:02] is doubt and whenever we look at our
[1:33:04] circumstances and things that are around
[1:33:06] us and we say oh no how am I going to
[1:33:08] get through this how is this going to
[1:33:10] happen how is that going to happen I
[1:33:12] don't have a clue how it's all going to
[1:33:14] happen but we serve a God that can make
[1:33:17] whatever needs to happen happen and
[1:33:19] there's things no doubt that you and I
[1:33:21] think needs to happen this way and that
[1:33:23] way God said no you got it all wrong and
[1:33:26] I've just come to a spot I realized Lord
[1:33:28] I don't know how it's supposed to work I
[1:33:30] don't know how a lot of these things are
[1:33:31] going to be that I just commit myself to
[1:33:34] you you're the one who orchestrated this
[1:33:37] plan I'm just playing this real real
[1:33:39] tiny tiny part but aren't you glad
[1:33:41] you're a part this morning I'm so glad
[1:33:44] saints that by the grace of God the Lord
[1:33:47] Jesus has called us himself we were not
[1:33:51] called by brother brandom you were not
[1:33:53] called by your pastor you were not
[1:33:55] called by some other great Minister but
[1:33:57] the Lord God himself called your
[1:34:00] [Applause]
[1:34:03] name
[1:34:05] Hallelujah notice Joseph in Genesis 414
[1:34:10] then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph and
[1:34:12] they brought him hastily out of the
[1:34:13] dungeon he shaved
[1:34:17] himself and changed his reignment and
[1:34:21] came unto pharaoh Genesis 41:42 and
[1:34:25] Pharaoh took off his
[1:34:28] ring from his hand and put it on
[1:34:31] Joseph's hand and arrayed him in
[1:34:36] vestures of fine linen and put a gold
[1:34:40] chain about his
[1:34:43] neck you see the changing of the clothes
[1:34:46] is a significance of
[1:34:49] changing
[1:34:51] positions now no doubt the prison
[1:34:53] clothes that he wore was very fitting
[1:34:57] for where he was but they would not
[1:35:00] match his new
[1:35:02] position now in reality when you look at
[1:35:05] it really what Lea has on it matches
[1:35:09] where she is but it don't match a son or
[1:35:11] daughter of God it will never produce
[1:35:15] the clo that is fittting for the Bride
[1:35:19] of Jesus Christ that's why we had to
[1:35:21] come out ruths chapter 3 verse two and
[1:35:25] now is not Boaz our Kindred with whose
[1:35:28] maidens thou was behold he went with
[1:35:30] barley tonight in the threshing floor
[1:35:34] wash thyself therefore and anoint thee
[1:35:38] and put thy reignment upon thee and get
[1:35:42] thee down to the FL but make not thyself
[1:35:45] known unto the man un he have done
[1:35:48] eating and drinking now remember she had
[1:35:51] on clothes that was very suited to her
[1:35:55] position and it was clothes of
[1:35:58] widowhood so she was a widow so when you
[1:36:02] looked at her you would know them
[1:36:04] whenever she come from the land of Moab
[1:36:06] she would have on these widow's clothes
[1:36:08] so every person knew okay this woman is
[1:36:11] a widow her husband has got killed she
[1:36:13] her husband has passed away but notice
[1:36:16] her mother-in-law and they only well
[1:36:18] trained in the word and she was getting
[1:36:20] her to this point why she's going to
[1:36:23] leave her to marriage what's she telling
[1:36:26] her go down and whenever you get that
[1:36:29] don't make yourself known well mother
[1:36:32] should I wear these clothes no take off
[1:36:35] your black hat take off your Veil take
[1:36:39] off your black clothes you know it's a
[1:36:41] sad thing to realize that many of the
[1:36:43] folks have come to the message but
[1:36:45] they've still gone on their old clothes
[1:36:46] of widowhood and they're not acting like
[1:36:49] a newly married bride of Jesus Christ
[1:36:52] but still acting like were servants out
[1:36:54] of there you remember the children of
[1:36:55] Israel come out of the land of Egypt and
[1:36:57] God had a much easier time of bringing
[1:37:00] them out of Egypt than he did getting
[1:37:02] Egypt out of them and we come out from
[1:37:05] under the slavery and the bondage of the
[1:37:07] world but have we got that slavery and
[1:37:10] bondage out of us come on somebody I
[1:37:13] ain't talking about free to sin I'm
[1:37:15] talking about free to live right free to
[1:37:18] walk in a place oh you imagine if
[1:37:21] Abraham would have been here this
[1:37:22] morning can you imagine if little little
[1:37:25] David would attended this service the
[1:37:27] deacons would done had to carry him out
[1:37:29] probably 27 times hit him in shouting
[1:37:31] and a running and a jumping David just
[1:37:34] by the law David said I love thy law
[1:37:37] better than my necessary food oh he said
[1:37:39] is sweet as honeycomb the law Thou shalt
[1:37:43] not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not oh if
[1:37:46] he would have been here this morning and
[1:37:48] evening light you folks would have been
[1:37:50] ashamed probably he'd have been up and
[1:37:52] around and around glory to God glory to
[1:37:55] God somebody give me my heart the Lord
[1:37:57] is my shepherd I shall not want he makes
[1:37:59] me to lie down and G pastor and David
[1:38:02] would have been over there and up there
[1:38:03] and out there and back there oh
[1:38:06] Hallelujah why because he loved the Lord
[1:38:09] so
[1:38:12] much and just had on a garment of Thou
[1:38:16] shalt not and thou shalt
[1:38:20] not young man if David would have had
[1:38:22] your hope Holy
[1:38:24] Ghost and you imagine he danced and
[1:38:27] shouted and
[1:38:31] rejoiced so Ruth had to remove her
[1:38:36] clothes of widowhood look at Esther
[1:38:39] chapter 5 verse one now it came to pass
[1:38:42] on the third day that Esther put on her
[1:38:46] royal
[1:38:48] apparel why she's dressing for the
[1:38:52] occasion amen
[1:38:54] I don't know about you I get sick and
[1:38:56] tired of being sick and
[1:38:58] tired I get so sick and tired of God's
[1:39:01] people being sick and beat down and you
[1:39:03] know not living an overcoming life I do
[1:39:05] not believe that the Lord Jesus wants us
[1:39:08] to close out this age barely hanging on
[1:39:12] from one service to another I believe in
[1:39:15] Repentance I thank God for it I thank
[1:39:17] God for the blood that's there whenever
[1:39:19] we make a mistake but I believe that
[1:39:22] there is another sphere in God that a
[1:39:25] child of God can live so close to the
[1:39:28] presence of God that the devil don't
[1:39:31] even know what to do with you that is a
[1:39:33] direct quote so I I I just thank God for
[1:39:36] all of that but I believe we can live in
[1:39:38] a a presence of the Lord Jesus that
[1:39:41] Satan is scared of you when you get up
[1:39:43] in the morning and your feet touch the
[1:39:45] floor and them Devils go to running
[1:39:48] right and left oh Lord here they come
[1:39:50] here they come they live through another
[1:39:52] night I'll tell you one thing if I go by
[1:39:54] the way of the grave and I die and Y all
[1:39:57] come to see me or hear brother Tim
[1:39:58] preach my funeral whoever I hope not
[1:40:01] only if I got a witness in heaven but I
[1:40:03] hope down in hell then devils are a
[1:40:06] running and a screaming and a holling
[1:40:08] hallelujah hallelujah he's dead cuz I
[1:40:11] believe I was born to torment the devil
[1:40:14] I was born to cast out Devils I was born
[1:40:18] Hallelujah to be an overcomer in this
[1:40:21] age I was born to we the garments of
[1:40:24] loyalty not only I but you were and you
[1:40:28] were and you were were born to be
[1:40:31] dressed in the CL of the word of this
[1:40:34] day and when you come in demons begin to
[1:40:38] [Applause]
[1:40:47] tremble but it's not just
[1:40:50] you it's your clothes that's right
[1:40:58] it's your
[1:41:00] clothes you see clothes can reflect true
[1:41:04] prophecy or false you remember St Martin
[1:41:08] the church has messenger whenever the
[1:41:09] devil appeared before him he said
[1:41:13] Martin I'm your lord Jesus worship me
[1:41:17] remember he had a crown on his head and
[1:41:19] dressed up like a king all that sort of
[1:41:21] thing Martin looked at him looked at at
[1:41:23] him now Martin is judging this by the
[1:41:27] word Martin don't you know me I'm your
[1:41:31] Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:41:34] Christ but he looks at him and looks at
[1:41:36] him he said Satan get out of here you
[1:41:40] got a crown on your head and he ain't
[1:41:42] got one yet but the Saints are going to
[1:41:45] crown him so clothes can prophesy
[1:41:49] against you or they can prophesy for you
[1:41:53] now it's much easier sometimes for
[1:41:55] people to come to a message church and
[1:41:57] you know they get rid of this out of
[1:41:58] their closet and that out of their
[1:42:00] closet and they start wearing dresses if
[1:42:01] they're women letting their hair grow
[1:42:03] out and if they're men hopefully they
[1:42:04] never did wear dresses but you never
[1:42:06] know this day but anyway they start
[1:42:07] looking Godly too but sometimes it's the
[1:42:10] clothes on the inside that can take
[1:42:13] years and years to ever get rid of
[1:42:16] bitterness and grudges and envy and
[1:42:18] strife Amen brother Donnie you see the
[1:42:21] Lord wants us to have on on the
[1:42:24] reflection of the outside what is
[1:42:27] already been clothed in the soul from
[1:42:30] the
[1:42:31] inside oh my so notice Now esther is
[1:42:36] going before the
[1:42:37] king she's not given a direct invitation
[1:42:41] which is deaths to do so that's
[1:42:45] right so you reckon she got up at
[1:42:47] morning said well I'm going to go see
[1:42:49] the king and her rollers is still in her
[1:42:52] hair
[1:42:54] and she's got on her old wore out house
[1:42:57] shoes she's got on that old gown that
[1:43:00] she's had on for 30 years that old house
[1:43:03] coat where you going going to see the
[1:43:07] king I'm his wife Hallelujah I'm the
[1:43:10] bride I'm married her I'm she knew not
[1:43:14] only her
[1:43:15] position but she must be clothed not
[1:43:18] only with dignity but
[1:43:22] humility
[1:43:25] imagine when she comes out and she just
[1:43:29] alls the people is say look at her I
[1:43:33] imagine she has on this beautiful
[1:43:35] beautiful dress and this you know stick
[1:43:37] in her hand and well G to
[1:43:43] God how you doing old King I want to
[1:43:46] talk to you buddy you got a little time
[1:43:49] for me I'm your
[1:43:52] wifey
[1:43:57] imagine every
[1:43:59] step it was a step of
[1:44:03] royalty she knew who she
[1:44:07] was and her clothes matched her
[1:44:13] opinion that's why when you get on your
[1:44:15] knees to pray if you approach it
[1:44:18] right the devil will try to talk you out
[1:44:20] of praying and it ain't no wonder ain't
[1:44:23] no wonder he don't want you to pray if I
[1:44:25] was a devil I wouldn't want you to pray
[1:44:27] neither you imagine the angels of God
[1:44:29] are hushed in
[1:44:33] heaven when you get on your knees to
[1:44:36] pray and your'll fight sleep and you'll
[1:44:39] fight this and that and the other when
[1:44:41] you go to pray it ain't no wonder the
[1:44:43] queen is
[1:44:45] approaching her King this is why the
[1:44:48] prophet tells us when we pray we should
[1:44:50] offer a little bit of worship we're
[1:44:52] priest right and we should offer a
[1:44:54] little bit of worship and we enter into
[1:44:56] his courts with praise and thanksgiving
[1:45:00] then we come and we make our petition
[1:45:04] known and it was so when the king
[1:45:08] saw
[1:45:11] Esther the queen standing in the court
[1:45:15] now remember it was not what she said
[1:45:18] yet but when
[1:45:20] he saw her
[1:45:24] I don't you understand if she would have
[1:45:26] come with her house clothes on and her
[1:45:30] slippers and all that sort of
[1:45:32] thing it would have been such
[1:45:38] reproach are you kidding
[1:45:40] me you disgrace me this
[1:45:44] way I wonder how sometimes our father
[1:45:47] feels when we go before him and we're
[1:45:49] like Beggars I'm not worthy I'm not
[1:45:52] worthy oh God I I'm not worthy I'm not
[1:45:55] good enough Lord here here I am again I
[1:45:58] I hate to even bother you I hate to even
[1:46:00] trouble you got so many you got so many
[1:46:02] more important people to deal with
[1:46:05] where'd you get that idea there ain't
[1:46:08] nobody any more important than you are
[1:46:11] you're a son and daughter of God on that
[1:46:13] Plateau we all stand at the same level
[1:46:15] brother Tim ain't more of a Son of God
[1:46:17] than I am I ain't more of a Son of God
[1:46:19] than any one of you Brothers here today
[1:46:21] our position and all that yes yes that's
[1:46:23] different but when we approach the Lord
[1:46:25] Jesus we stand right there with the same
[1:46:28] Robes of dignity and honor and whenever
[1:46:31] we call out upon his name we are a
[1:46:33] spiritual priesthood for he has made us
[1:46:36] Kings and Priests unto our God and we
[1:46:39] shall reign on the earth sisters in the
[1:46:42] Old Testament only men could be priests
[1:46:45] but the Lord God made a special
[1:46:47] inclusion in this new covenant because
[1:46:50] not only are the brothers priests but
[1:46:52] the sisters stand right there and you
[1:46:54] can grab a hold oh Hallelujah of your
[1:46:58] position as a daughter of God and be
[1:47:00] able to pray oh my and watch God Shake
[1:47:04] hell at the prayer of a daughter of God
[1:47:07] you remember whenever the woman had a
[1:47:09] baby and there was up in the in the
[1:47:10] balcony and there was a little woman
[1:47:12] sitting there and this woman was walking
[1:47:14] back and forth and back and forth and
[1:47:15] the baby was crying and brother Brown
[1:47:17] was meeting and she said here honey you
[1:47:19] take my chair you take it oh thank you
[1:47:21] sister thank you and she said honey I
[1:47:24] just keep feeling this in my heart could
[1:47:26] could I pray for your baby I know you
[1:47:28] got a prayer card and you on my little
[1:47:29] prayer wouldn't be nothing but could I
[1:47:31] pray for you anyway and she said sure
[1:47:33] honey you pray for her and the woman
[1:47:35] come down later you remember the story
[1:47:37] come down later in the Prine brother
[1:47:39] said that baby is already healed that
[1:47:41] woman right up there in that balcony God
[1:47:44] heard her prayer and he said why would
[1:47:46] God do it being a mother she could have
[1:47:49] a feeling of compassion that maybe
[1:47:51] brother brandom couldn't I want wonder I
[1:47:54] wonder sometimes if the trials and the
[1:47:56] tests and the things that we go through
[1:47:59] that if God is Not preparing us to be
[1:48:01] able to enter into a greater place as
[1:48:04] priests I've always hated cancer cancer
[1:48:07] took my mama cancer took my grandmother
[1:48:10] but I've got a new reason to hate it now
[1:48:13] cancer my baby girl figh oh no the devil
[1:48:15] couldn't take her I'm the God was done
[1:48:18] with and I thank you all for every
[1:48:19] prayer that you pray that I've got more
[1:48:21] of a hatred now for that devil that I've
[1:48:24] ever had in my entire life cancer has
[1:48:26] Afflicted one of my brothers brother Ron
[1:48:29] Spencer and I hate that devil amen when
[1:48:32] people come up for prayer I've got
[1:48:35] something there brother de that I didn't
[1:48:37] have before I've got something there
[1:48:39] what did it do it dressed me more
[1:48:42] fitting it dressed me in a way where I
[1:48:45] can meet this enemy it's the same with
[1:48:48] your trials and your test don't let
[1:48:50] Satan beat you down with them but
[1:48:52] realize God is molding you Esther God is
[1:48:57] molding you why for such a
[1:49:07] time so put on your word
[1:49:12] garments and take those prayer
[1:49:16] requests with your broken
[1:49:21] heart
[1:49:23] I remember hearing brother random say it
[1:49:26] years and years ago and it puzzled
[1:49:28] me when he said
[1:49:31] God you have broken my
[1:49:34] heart
[1:49:36] time and time
[1:49:39] again but I thank you for
[1:49:43] it you remember this little baby laying
[1:49:47] there
[1:49:48] dying her eyes
[1:49:51] Crossing
[1:49:54] the devil no doubt rejoiced and
[1:49:58] laughed but he didn't
[1:50:01] laugh when one after another after
[1:50:05] another cross-side babies would come
[1:50:08] across that platform and not a one of
[1:50:11] them walk away without being
[1:50:17] healed God was closing his Prophet with
[1:50:21] something in the cost of his
[1:50:24] word there's something about suffering
[1:50:28] there's something about it being woven
[1:50:30] in our garments are Divine but they are
[1:50:34] human as well are they not in this
[1:50:37] attire that we wear as the elect of God
[1:50:41] we are are so privileged to be able to
[1:50:44] sit in Heavenly places in him and hear
[1:50:47] things that no other age has been able
[1:50:50] to hear but on the contrast side of that
[1:50:53] we will be tried sometimes to such a
[1:50:58] place it seemed like the heavens have
[1:51:01] shut themselves said my God won't even
[1:51:04] hear you no
[1:51:07] more but it's only part of the woven
[1:51:11] tapestry that will come together to make
[1:51:14] the cost of the
[1:51:16] word for was there air of people that
[1:51:19] was ever tried like him remember
[1:51:23] you're reflected by the antitype of the
[1:51:25] beaten golden Candlestick that your life
[1:51:27] will be so
[1:51:29] beaten my little brother sitting behind
[1:51:31] me here how many trials and tests has he
[1:51:33] been
[1:51:37] through would he have ever thought the
[1:51:40] Lord would have taken away his
[1:51:43] Queen and he would have to go through
[1:51:46] how many ever months years that it'll be
[1:51:48] of this
[1:51:49] journey without her by his side
[1:51:54] there's things about the will of God
[1:51:57] that are
[1:51:58] frightening there's things about the
[1:52:01] will of God we will never
[1:52:05] understand but I learned a long time ago
[1:52:09] even when I don't understand I still
[1:52:12] trust
[1:52:14] him understanding is a great thing but
[1:52:18] there's sometimes understanding is not
[1:52:21] what we need but we actually need
[1:52:27] trust Esther's life was on the line you
[1:52:31] imagine her contemplating
[1:52:34] this so she' fasted up to this
[1:52:38] time and they would wear certain clothes
[1:52:42] dressed for the occasion she would not
[1:52:44] put on a robe and have a diam and her
[1:52:47] crown when she's down fasting but get
[1:52:51] down and sacla and ashes and take the
[1:52:53] ashes and throw them over them
[1:52:56] themselves like this so you imagine when
[1:52:57] they would get up and they were weeping
[1:53:00] and crying oh I don't I oh I don't I I
[1:53:07] don't Elohim Elohim Adon and they' take
[1:53:12] them ashes and throw it all over
[1:53:14] themselves and it would run down their
[1:53:16] face and mixed with the sweat and the
[1:53:18] tears that was on their body but they
[1:53:21] had on their apprpriate attire what was
[1:53:24] it a broken
[1:53:27] Spirit reaching out to
[1:53:30] God but now she must
[1:53:33] step into her dressing
[1:53:38] room she must wash away all the
[1:53:43] ashes wipe away the
[1:53:45] tears the persperation of ardan's
[1:53:50] prayer and dress
[1:53:53] like a queen in
[1:53:55] presentation not a queen in
[1:54:07] morning it must have been quite a
[1:54:09] transition for
[1:54:12] her cuz as she stands there feeling I
[1:54:16] must
[1:54:17] change I must change God help me how can
[1:54:21] I get from this mind ET how can I get
[1:54:23] from this
[1:54:25] mindset your clothes might
[1:54:31] help so you lay them aside and you start
[1:54:35] with the base layer of
[1:54:38] justification and you put on
[1:54:41] sanctification true baptism of the Holy
[1:54:43] Ghost then you go to getting all the
[1:54:45] adornments you know all the gifts and
[1:54:47] the specialities of the
[1:54:50] attire and then you look in the mirror
[1:54:52] and you
[1:54:53] say daddy is that
[1:54:59] me is that truly
[1:55:03] me because a while ago you looked in the
[1:55:05] mirror and you saw a Broken Man a broken
[1:55:09] woman your countenance was so fallen and
[1:55:12] you were so
[1:55:14] sad but now you step back in front of
[1:55:17] the mirror and you say is that really
[1:55:21] me
[1:55:25] I don't know exactly what day of the
[1:55:27] week it'll be I don't really
[1:55:29] care I don't know what time it'll be
[1:55:32] Eastern Central Pacific New Zealand time
[1:55:37] I don't really care about that either
[1:55:40] but one of these
[1:55:41] days we will start to see our loved
[1:55:45] ones appear before
[1:55:50] us I've been in Johnson City now for
[1:55:52] many years one of the sisters deacons
[1:55:54] wives always kept a record of how many
[1:55:56] funerals I've preached since I've been
[1:55:58] there 144 I think it is
[1:56:01] Carol 144 people I've buried it's pretty
[1:56:05] good sized Church ain't it since I've
[1:56:07] been
[1:56:09] there so on that Resurrection
[1:56:12] morning I got plans for a big
[1:56:20] visitation Hallelujah
[1:56:23] notice what she's doing she's
[1:56:26] dressing in a
[1:56:28] way that will
[1:56:30] please her
[1:56:34] husband and bear the dignity and honor
[1:56:38] that he himself
[1:56:40] expresses from his position she wants to
[1:56:43] match
[1:56:47] him praise God look at Mark chapter 1
[1:56:51] verse 6
[1:56:53] and John was clothed with camel's hair
[1:56:56] and a girdle of skin about his
[1:56:59] loins and did eat
[1:57:01] Locust and wild
[1:57:03] honey you can tell John wasn't going to
[1:57:07] a
[1:57:08] wedding he's going to a
[1:57:12] thrashing I mean he's a sword slanging
[1:57:15] head chopped off profit he's fixing to
[1:57:18] Flay them he's fixing to cut him down
[1:57:21] and he's dressed
[1:57:22] for the
[1:57:24] occasion it wouldn't have been fitting
[1:57:26] for him to walk out in a suit like I
[1:57:29] have on today or any of these other
[1:57:31] brothers here it would have not been
[1:57:33] becoming at all it would have not been
[1:57:37] becoming for him in his diet to pulled
[1:57:40] up through McDonald's and ordered you
[1:57:42] know whatever your favorite thing is and
[1:57:45] your latte you know all them things that
[1:57:47] y'all drink it would have not been
[1:57:49] fitting he had a crude diet for a crude
[1:57:52] man preaching a crude message to A Lost
[1:57:56] Generation but it was so fitting for
[1:57:59] what God chose for the hour notice in
[1:58:03] Luke chap 2: 7 birth of Jesus and she
[1:58:07] brought forth her firstborn son and
[1:58:09] wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[1:58:12] laid him in a Manger because there was
[1:58:14] no room for him in the end what was it
[1:58:18] clothes fit for the occasion so it was
[1:58:22] wasn't born in a Marriott he was not
[1:58:24] born in an InterContinental hotel but he
[1:58:27] was born and laid in a Manger so his
[1:58:30] attire was very fitting for the Lamb of
[1:58:35] God is that right notice that he himself
[1:58:38] dresses to match the occasion keep that
[1:58:43] in mind Mark chapter 9:2 and after six
[1:58:46] days Jesus take us with him Peter and
[1:58:48] James and John and leads them into a
[1:58:51] high mountain apart by themselves and he
[1:58:53] was
[1:58:55] transfigured before them the word
[1:58:57] transfigured means to transform to
[1:59:00] changed into another form Christ's
[1:59:03] appearance was changed and was with
[1:59:05] resplendant is the word there
[1:59:07] resplendant with Divine brightness on
[1:59:10] the Mount of transfiguration now notice
[1:59:13] he's fixing to typify the great Rapture
[1:59:17] and the resurrection so the swaddling
[1:59:20] cloth would not be the proper attire for
[1:59:23] him to wear on that Transfiguration now
[1:59:26] no doubt he walked up there with that
[1:59:28] one piece woven garment that he wore for
[1:59:30] many many years of his life and whenever
[1:59:33] he walked up there it was perfectly
[1:59:34] fitting for a humble lowly servant of
[1:59:37] God but even God would not allow him to
[1:59:41] stand there in the type until his
[1:59:44] garments had been changed to match the
[1:59:48] occasion now if the Lord Jesus could not
[1:59:51] stand there with his old garments on
[1:59:54] what convinces us we can stand there
[1:59:56] with ours on we will not be able to do
[1:59:59] it so he himself had to be changed into
[2:00:04] Oh Glory an an outfit that would match
[2:00:08] the occasion is that right so he was
[2:00:12] transfigured or changed and it was him
[2:00:16] receiving of course the placing of a son
[2:00:19] and his reignment did Shine and the
[2:00:21] glory of God was upon him now the verb
[2:00:24] there that that uh that Mark used
[2:00:26] whenever he wrote that was metamorph
[2:00:28] which denotes a transformation of the
[2:00:32] essential form proceeding from within
[2:00:37] and it's the same word that Paul uses in
[2:00:40] the Book of Romans I beseech you
[2:00:41] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[2:00:43] that you present your bodies a Living
[2:00:45] Sacrifice holding acceptable unto the
[2:00:48] Lord which is only your reasonable
[2:00:50] service being not conformed to this
[2:00:52] world but be ye transformed metamorph so
[2:00:57] we are to be transformed where not from
[2:01:00] the outside in from the inside out and
[2:01:04] if you've got the right thing on the
[2:01:05] inside it brings this outside subject to
[2:01:08] the word of God now remember your body
[2:01:11] is like them people that live in the
[2:01:12] Millennium it ain't got the Holy Ghost
[2:01:14] and it never will get the Holy Ghost but
[2:01:17] the spirit of God inside of us makes
[2:01:19] this old man right here go to church
[2:01:21] that's right yes that's right my soul
[2:01:23] wants to worship God but my soul ain't
[2:01:26] got a mouse my soul wants to praise God
[2:01:29] but my soul Ain't Got No Hands my soul
[2:01:31] every now and then wants to dance but my
[2:01:33] soul ain't got no feet so you know what
[2:01:36] my soul tells my body give me yourself
[2:01:40] but I don't want to dance I don't want
[2:01:42] to praise God I said give me yourself
[2:01:45] and shut up and do what I tell you to do
[2:01:48] I want to clap hands this morning what
[2:01:50] am I going to do all right then my soul
[2:01:53] is the control to oh I wish somebody
[2:01:55] would preach with me this morning you
[2:01:56] see my clothes in my soul is making my
[2:02:01] body obey and it shows that I'm truly
[2:02:04] going in the Rapture and whenever I act
[2:02:07] it out by the grace of God I get a
[2:02:10] little bit of touch of my new
[2:02:14] outfit praise the Lord praise the
[2:02:19] Lord amen this is why we believe in
[2:02:22] miracles this is why we believe in
[2:02:25] Healing The Sick every time we see
[2:02:27] somebody heal it is a little bit of a
[2:02:30] down payment of the Resurrection we see
[2:02:33] the Lord doing in a moment of time what
[2:02:36] he's fixing to do to all of
[2:02:38] [Applause]
[2:02:41] us
[2:02:43] hallelujah one of our Deacon Brothers
[2:02:45] come up just for last service when I was
[2:02:47] there at the church been having a
[2:02:49] pinched nerve up here on the top of his

[2:03:27] my hands his clothing come out and

[2:03:32] ministers come out and run through their
[2:03:34] hands and the spirit of God used our
[2:03:37] hands to perform a great Supernatural
[2:03:41] [Applause]
[2:03:41] [Music]
[2:03:44] move Oh Glory to God so the Lord Jesus
[2:03:49] put on a robe of
[2:03:53] immortality and stepped into
[2:03:56] it and they looked at
[2:03:59] him Peter James and John they said
[2:04:02] there's Moses and Elijah now I want to
[2:04:04] ask you one question how did they know
[2:04:10] that there was no pictures of
[2:04:13] Moses there was no pictures of
[2:04:17] Elijah it's not like they had it on
[2:04:19] their iPhone every day and you know
[2:04:20] every day they get up you know memories
[2:04:22] of yesterday and memories of 2500 years
[2:04:25] ago how did they know
[2:04:28] it them three standing on the mountain
[2:04:31] so impacted them dressed in
[2:04:36] immortality it gave them a foresight of
[2:04:39] what it's going to be on that day that
[2:04:40] we will know as we are known
[2:04:47] that's
[2:04:49] Hallelujah 2 Corinthians chapter 3 Verse
[2:04:52] 18 let's read there if you
[2:04:53] would but we
[2:04:56] all with open
[2:04:59] face
[2:05:01] beholding as in a
[2:05:04] glass the
[2:05:07] glory of the Lord we all with open face
[2:05:13] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[2:05:17] Lord are changed into the same image
[2:05:22] from glory to glory even as by the
[2:05:28] spirit of the
[2:05:30] Lord praise God mark 9:3 his reignment
[2:05:35] became shining exceeding white as snow
[2:05:38] so as no Fuller on Earth can whiten
[2:05:41] Revelation
[2:05:42] 101 and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[2:05:46] down from
[2:05:48] heaven you say it with me
[2:05:52] clothes
[2:05:55] ah well this Lord Jesus is a man of many
[2:05:59] costumes in
[2:06:02] it swaddling
[2:06:04] cloth glorified body and the here we see
[2:06:08] him introducing our time Hallelujah and
[2:06:12] what's he got on this time clothed with
[2:06:16] a
[2:06:18] cloud isn't it amazing that John does
[2:06:20] not pluralize that
[2:06:23] and say there was clouds
[2:06:25] everywhere but it was one
[2:06:27] Cloud closed with a
[2:06:31] cloud I know you've seen that
[2:06:34] picture him with his wig
[2:06:37] on haven't you I'm sure you've looked at
[2:06:40] it many many times and I'm sure you've
[2:06:43] noticed that whenever it's turned the
[2:06:45] right way his head is looking down on
[2:06:49] the
[2:06:50] Earth wonder what he's looking for the
[2:06:53] rest of his
[2:07:00] body what's he looking for the rest of
[2:07:03] his body what's his ministry in US
[2:07:07] looking for the rest of his body we're
[2:07:09] not here to build a kingdom we're not
[2:07:11] here to build you know something for for
[2:07:13] us ministers we're not here for that we
[2:07:15] are here looking for that last one so we
[2:07:18] can go home we're here looking for his
[2:07:21] body that's the anointing all the
[2:07:23] anointing you know of Kingdom Builders
[2:07:25] is totally different from that it's all
[2:07:26] about them and their Ministry and so on
[2:07:28] and so on and so on but the real move of
[2:07:30] God what is it about it's about getting
[2:07:33] that last one in getting them filled
[2:07:36] with the Holy Ghost getting them to
[2:07:38] their position in Christ Jesus so we can
[2:07:41] leave this world Hallelujah and the
[2:07:44] devil can have it I said the devil can
[2:07:48] have it I don't know about you I'm
[2:07:49] looking for the coming of the Lord more
[2:07:51] than I've ever in my entire life I want
[2:07:54] to leave this place it's unfitted place
[2:07:57] for us to live it's ungodly it's Unholy
[2:08:02] it's unclean it's
[2:08:05] filthy it's not
[2:08:08] conducive for my
[2:08:10] beautiful pure white
[2:08:14] clothes so can you
[2:08:16] imagine here you're dressed in these
[2:08:19] beautiful glistening Gard gments
[2:08:22] and everywhere's around you is black
[2:08:27] smudy
[2:08:29] fils you can't already go through a
[2:08:31] Walmart checkout with being insulted by
[2:08:34] pictures on a magazine or some woman
[2:08:35] standing
[2:08:38] there everywhere you can't even go to
[2:08:40] the grocery store and buy your groceries
[2:08:43] without them playing rock and roll music
[2:08:44] I've never understood what does bacon
[2:08:46] have to do with rock and roll what in
[2:08:49] the world of SpaghettiOs and cereal what
[2:08:51] in the world don't you understand it's
[2:08:53] invading it's invading it's clothing
[2:08:57] them their music is preparing them it's
[2:09:01] closing
[2:09:04] them just as ours is helping clothe
[2:09:11] us I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[2:09:13] from heaven clothed with the cloud and a
[2:09:16] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[2:09:19] as it were the Sun and his feet
[2:09:21] as pillars of fire Revelation
[2:09:26] 19:13 now watch him again now he's going
[2:09:29] to come dress like something totally
[2:09:32] different in Revelation 10 he was
[2:09:34] clothed with a vesture dipping blood and
[2:09:38] his name is called the word of God
[2:09:43] uhoh and the armies
[2:09:47] plural which were in
[2:09:50] heaven followed him upon white horses
[2:09:54] now look how they're
[2:09:58] dressed look at the significance of John
[2:10:01] seeing what clothes he had on and what
[2:10:05] they had
[2:10:09] on now you see the marriage supper has
[2:10:12] done took place so we're not all sitting
[2:10:14] around the
[2:10:17] reception oh don't you long for that
[2:10:23] Carol and I left the wedding practice
[2:10:24] the other day after we had ate and
[2:10:28] everybody was standing up and telling
[2:10:30] the different things you know about the
[2:10:31] bride and the groom and all that I
[2:10:34] started going out to my vehicle I just
[2:10:36] started crying I'm a baby you see I just
[2:10:39] started crying I told her she what
[2:10:41] what's the matter I said I just got to
[2:10:44] thinking wonder what it would be like
[2:10:46] when we all sat at that great table that
[2:10:50] day
[2:10:52] and we going talking about the different
[2:10:55] things how we
[2:10:57] overcome we reach across the table and

[2:11:01] grab a hold of mine we'll both be the
[2:11:03] same
[2:11:05] age and then all of a sudden the door
[2:11:10] opens and here he
[2:11:14] comes and he walks out the
[2:11:17] king and he's great
[2:11:20] splendor
[2:11:22] and they start up at the head of the
[2:11:24] table and come down through there and
[2:11:26] each one of them gets their
[2:11:28] time and they go look it up at
[2:11:32] him what you going to
[2:11:36] say how you going to
[2:11:39] feel when you get your
[2:11:41] time and he may lay his hand over on
[2:11:44] your shoulder and call you by your real
[2:11:46] word
[2:11:48] name and you're sitting there and tears
[2:11:50] running out your eyes

[2:15:21] trolls on read a little bit history no
[2:15:22] close in Christ
[2:15:24] time the families of the bride and the
[2:15:27] groom would
[2:15:28] meet with some Elders there as Witnesses
[2:15:32] the young man would give the young woman
[2:15:35] either a gold ring or some article of
[2:15:39] value simply sometimes a document which
[2:15:42] will be a promise to marry
[2:15:46] her so as job said in job 29:14 I put on
[2:15:50] righteous and it clothed me my judgment
[2:15:53] was a robe and a diadem Paul in Romans
[2:15:57] 13:14 said but put ye on the Lord Jesus
[2:16:01] Christ I'm sure you've looked at this
[2:16:03] brother Tim I love this word it's in uo
[2:16:05] which means to be clothed in to
[2:16:10] sink into
[2:16:13] clothing so put on the Lord Jesus
[2:16:16] Christ and you actually
[2:16:19] sink in into clothing and your
[2:16:23] clothes is the Lord Jesus that's why
[2:16:25] Paul would say in Thessalonians I pray
[2:16:27] your whole Spirit soul and body be
[2:16:32] preserved
[2:16:33] blameless to the
[2:16:35] day of Jesus
[2:16:39] Christ don't you appreciate
[2:16:41] him notice in Samuel Jonathan stripped
[2:16:45] himself of the robe that was upon him
[2:16:48] and gave it to David and his garments he
[2:16:53] gave to David and even his sword and his
[2:16:56] bow and his
[2:16:58] girdle so David was seen wearing
[2:17:02] Jonathan's
[2:17:06] clothes so he was
[2:17:09] Jonathan by
[2:17:13] representation praise be to
[2:17:17] God and then Jonathan put on David's
[2:17:20] clothes
[2:17:23] for he who knew no
[2:17:25] sin became
[2:17:28] sin that we might become the
[2:17:30] righteousness of
[2:17:33] God in
[2:17:36] him let me
[2:17:38] close there was an old brother brother
[2:17:40] Tim that I knew in Pentecost and
[2:17:44] he his name was brother Moran he was a
[2:17:47] preacher preached for many many years
[2:17:50] every time this brother would get up
[2:17:51] either to testify or to preach he'd take
[2:17:55] his right
[2:17:57] hand and he'd stand there like
[2:18:00] this whether he was just testifying or
[2:18:03] whether he would preach and he would rub
[2:18:07] like
[2:18:09] that so I asked him I was just a young
[2:18:11] guy so I asked him I asked my uncle
[2:18:15] about it was was the pastor first he
[2:18:16] said he kind of told me the story he
[2:18:18] said Donnie ask him let him tell you
[2:18:20] about it
[2:18:22] so this man when he was
[2:18:24] younger he had a dream and in this dream
[2:18:27] he walked up before the Lord it was a
[2:18:31] dream and everything about him was
[2:18:34] glistening
[2:18:36] white except for one
[2:18:39] spot right there in his
[2:18:42] trousers near his pocket almost a
[2:18:45] perfect arms
[2:18:48] length and he hadn't even noticed it
[2:18:50] till he got into the presence of that
[2:18:52] light and he walked into the presence of
[2:18:55] that light and he looked down and he saw
[2:18:57] that and he took his hand and tried to
[2:19:01] hide
[2:19:03] it so even when he would preach he would
[2:19:06] get up as a
[2:19:08] reminder just to remind him you don't
[2:19:11] want no
[2:19:14] spots can we bow our heads this
[2:19:19] morning
[2:19:29] hallelujah praise the Lord
[2:19:33] Jesus praise the Lord
[2:19:37] Jesus I wonder how many here today you
[2:19:40] just said brother Donnie with all my
[2:19:44] heart I want to be clothed in his
[2:19:47] righteousness just raise your hand to
[2:19:49] the Lord there
[2:19:51] maybe you know of a spot maybe you know
[2:19:54] of something there in your life
[2:19:56] that you needed to be taken care of
[2:20:00] today just let the presence of God meet
[2:20:05] you I know it's a great challenge in
[2:20:07] this day because everywhere we look
[2:20:10] around us
[2:20:11] it's all the darkness and the filth of
[2:20:14] the
[2:20:14] world if your soul is sealed today in
[2:20:17] the presence of God Satan can never
[2:20:20] never get the that
[2:20:21] soul but if he can affect your spirit
[2:20:25] and you pick up things in your spirit or
[2:20:27] your attitude or you pick up things in
[2:20:29] the flesh that Grieves the spirit of
[2:20:34] God oh God will correct you and he'll
[2:20:36] straighten you out but just affects your
[2:20:39] walk with the Lord and your fellowship
[2:20:41] with the
[2:20:43] Lord and the rest of you may be here
[2:20:45] today say Lord I don't want nothing in

[2:22:21] and then when they turn older that's
[2:22:23] when they go to getting off either
