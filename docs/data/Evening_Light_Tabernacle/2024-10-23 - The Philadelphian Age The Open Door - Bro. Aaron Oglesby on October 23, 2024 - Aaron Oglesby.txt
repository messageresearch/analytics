just came off the road oursel last night and uh but we're here tonight and we're thankful for each one of you that that has come out tonight with us and and uh tonight we want to get into to the the church ages a little bit uh it's been a while since I was able to do a church age study with schedules and different camps and different things but I want to look into it a little bit tonight and try to get back on track with the study that we've been doing so if you have your Bibles and you'd like to turn with me to Revelation 3 and verse 7 we're going to read 7 through1 13 we're going to speak to tonight on the Philadelphian age the the open door we're going to speak on the open door tonight amen amen a't God good to us amen his word is so rich and there's so many wonderful things that we can find in it and I just pray that he'll open our eyes tonight to to some things verse 7 says unto the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things saith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee verse 10 because thou has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take thy crown him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God in the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from God and I will write upon him my name my new name he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen you can have your seats tonight aren't you thankful that the Lord has anointed us and given us ears to hear in this day you know it just seems so simple he that hath an ear we know that doesn't mean physically because everybody has ears everybody physically can hear but but because that the Lord has anointed our ears and because he sent a prophet in this day let's just be honest to to break these things down it's allowed us to see and to understand what what's going on in our day and one thing that we have found as as we've studied that that's very important not just to this study of the church ages but just to study the Bible in general is the unchanging character of God brother brandom says it is the Revelation that God never changes and he he said this was the key to his whole study this is how he knew who the messengers were this is this is how he um got into this to to the church ages and understood things he said it was the whole key the Revelation that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is amen the very the very um uh I wouldn't say theme the very theme of the message was Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever brother Brandon would would take this and say not even necessarily referencing the church ages but but he would say that it is the Keystone of the whole Bible he the Keystone of the whole Bible is that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and I'm thankful tonight that our God doesn't change I'm thankful that what he says stands and what he think stands and and whatever thought he had of you it still stands in the eternals when he saw you as a son tonight he still thinks of you as a son and you may say well I've had these failures and I've had these ups and downs and I've had these the the these struggles his thoughts of you can not change you you are a part of God you're an attribute of God and so he still looks at you tonight as son he looks at you tonight as daughter now if you're in a backsliding condition he's not going to leave you there he's not going to let you get by with it but he's also not going to change what he thinks about you amen I'm thankful that what he says stands he isn't like a man who can change his mind and one day you're this and your buddies and the next day he's mad at you and and you're cut off but but tonight you have an open door to God you you have the ability to to have a relationship with God because he's open that door amen his word is sure and we can rejoice in that tonight amen so tonight we're going we're going to look at the the city of Philadelphia and the age that that City represents and brother brand would say these seven churches located in Asia Minor contain certain characteristics within them and at that ancient date so he's looking back to the city and they had these characteristics at that ancient date which became mature fruit in later ages amen amen so as we look at this each City had characteristics about them and maybe they were little small things things that it took a prophet to recognize little small things maybe things that that we would never notice and those characteristics were like seeds and then they were there in that City and they would become manifest in an age to come years later so so one thing I want us to stay focused on tonight is we may talk about a city but it only represents the age that we're studying amen but the prophet could look back in there and see it talking about this city and go but it's going to represent a period of time way down the road amen so we've we've come to we've studied five of the churches and tonight we come to Philadelphia and you can see it right there on the right hand side in between Sardis and Le oosa it was the sixth age it lasted from 1750 to 1906 and it's known as the age of Brotherly Love and and as brother brandham teaches on on the Philadelphian age he spends a bit of time at the beginning making sure that we understand even though I have dates up there he he makes sure that we understand that the ages blend there is no exact this age ended on this day and this age started on this day but the ages overlap and he talks about that a lot during this study and he says there's an overlapping of the ages and and he begins to show as these ages overlap he also begins to talk about the rep repetition of the false Vine in each age in other words as the religions and the false doctrines that begin way back at the earliest ages he shows that they continue on age after age after age because remember Spirits don't die spirits don't die then they don't they don't go away so so maybe it had a new name attached to it maybe it came with with a little different way and and attacked in a different side and it disguised itself differently but it's the same devil in every age the same devil that come against Adam and Eve is the same devil coming against you in this day amen that those Spirits never die you can Trail him from Genesis all the way to Revelation and as it relates to the church ages you can find him right there in Ephesus and you can find him coming down attacking the True Vine all the way down to the age of Leo deia amen so we're talking about the city of Philadelphia and it was built in a famous wine growing District second largest city in ancient Lydia suffered frequent earthquakes and yet it was the longest lasting city of all the Seven Cities of Revelation as a matter of fact it still stands today under a different name that I can't pronounce so I didn't even put up there but it's still standing to to this day Philadelphia is still there and and interesting enough brother brandham takes and he begins to talk about the coins of the city and I found this very interesting he begins to talk about the coins and he says the mage of the coins suggests the deity of the city to be bakas he says now bakas is the same as nenus or Nimrod now if you were remember in the last age that we talked about Sardis and Sardis worship Cil and I'm just going to lay this out for just a second and that City Sardis was used to represent that age because the characteristic of that age was the worship of the Jezebel system okay so they worshiped cibil and it was used to represent that age because they were going to worship The Jezebel system and we saw Martin Luther begin to protest in the last age and he began to break fre fre or break off from the Catholic church and one thing we know in the scripture called it out and and it held it against him is they didn't break completely free from the Catholic Church they didn't come all the way out even though they they protested there was too many Catholic Traditions that was carried right on over into protestantism amen and so they didn't break free but but but but they were getting loose just a little bit they they they just didn't go all the way back to the original they didn't go all the way back listen Church we've come a long way but we can't stop short of going all the way back to the original We Can't Stop I'm thankful for how far we've come and and and but we didn't get called out just to be called out the same message that calls you out takes you in amen there was a lot of people in the days of of Moses that came out under a pillar of fire there was a lot of people that left Egypt that never made it to a promise land they they ended up stuck in the wilderness they end up grumbling they end up complaining they saw the Miracles but they didn't go all the way church we got to be willing to go all the way tonight don't stop short of all the way back to where this message was taking us amen but Luther they were breaking free but they weren't going all the way back to the original word they were being snared by the spirit of organization that they became the daughters of that system and and they are so much like the mother church that the Bible refers to those Church systems as Harless well Justice Jezebel we studied it before Justice Jezebel had a daughter named aalia who carried on just like her mother now the Catholic church had daughters and they were churches with new names they were just like Mama but they had new names and brother brandom says this about the coins he says what illumination this brings to our minds he said here is a coin and these coins had bakas on one side and the mother on the other he said here a coin with the God on one side and the Priestess or propheus on the other he says Now flip a coin does it matter which way it comes down no sir it's still the same coin that is the Roman religion of Jesus and Mary so if we trace this back we know that bakas was the same as Nimrod and if we remember Nimrod was the one who started the mother son or the mother God worship to begin with amen and so what I love talking about trailing this all the way down Through the Ages once again we can see the roots of that Catholic Church tied right back into Nimrod you can see the roots of it tied right back in to Pagan worship listen there's nothing Christian about it it's Pagan from the core it's Pagan at its roots you can trace it all the way back to Nimrod brother Bram says and now at this point in this age he says we're not thinking about Rome only no there's not only the great heart charlot certainly not for she by her fornication has become a mother her daughters are now coins of the same minage think about they make a mint and then every coin that comes through there is exactly the same they come out exactly the same listen I'm so thankful tonight we heard a call that said come out of her my people we're not mened like that system we're not mened like that church but we're mened all we're mened like our father we're we're copies of our father were're Sons and Daughters of the king we're we're called chosen bought with the price filled with the spirit of God tonight we're minted Sons and Daughters of God tonight amen we've returned to the homeland of the original word hallelujah I'm so thankful that we're not carbon copies said come out of her that you be not partakers of her plagues amen so during this age we know that the messenger was John Wesley I love how brother brandham says this he says the messenger to this age was without doubt John Wesley and I just that just struck me just the without doubt part how awesome is it tonight to be beli in what you believe without doubt we had a prophet coming this day and he said you know I maybe I look at it and there was a lot it could be he said no without doubt it's John Wesley I'm telling you we got a message tonight we can believe without doubt without doubt there's going to be a body change without doubt there's going to be a Rapture without doubt he still heals without doubt he still fills with the spirit without doubt we serve a living God tonight we can stand firm tonight without doubt heyen you don't you don't have to question it you don't have to worry about it tonight we have something we can believe without doubt he says the messenger John Wesley John Wesley is an incredible person from a historical standpoint point I could have just stood up here and talked about him all night but I just pulled some things that were intriguing to me and hopefully you find it interesting as well he lived to the age somewhere between 87 and 88 it's not exactly exactly clear but he was one of 19 children rode 4,500 miles a year on Horseback in his lifetime he preached more than 40,000 sermons I read that and I think I'm like at 108 I'm not going to get there and I'm not going to do it on a horse 40,000 sermons I just found this interesting there's nothing spiritual about this he coined the phrase agree to disagree and I loved it because it said the reason why is so many of his brothers now remember this the age of Brotherly Love so so many of people he called Brothers disagreed with him so many of them would come and come at him and argue and debate and he instead of of making it something ugly and letting it tear him apart he came up with the term we're just going to agree to disagree because he wanted to remain in Fellowship he didn't want to allow disagreements to tear him apart and he came up with agree to disagree and I love that in the age of Brotherly Love he he was going to let his Brotherly Love show forth and not be well you disagree with me we can't Fellowship we don't see it the same listen we're grown-ups we got to be able to see things different and love one another we got to be able to see things different and say let's just agree to disagree in his lifetime he rode 250,000 miles on a horse let me put that in perspective that would take him around the globe 10 times he had a god of Works strict set of rules that that he belied believe should and things that should not be done they were called Methods hence the name Methodist that was actually a derogatory term used against him early in then his ministry it was they were methodists and it was something they threw at him in an ugly way he was ostracized by his colleagues and his students at Oxford he was banned by Churches so he preached in the fields he was attacked by rioter many times who tried to kill him mobs would often burst into his meetings and attack him with clubs and Stones he had large chunks of his hair pulled out while he tried to preach the gospel he was attacked by a bull that was intentionally released into his meetings I'm at 108 and if that [Music] happens we can't have no bull coming in the church can you imagine sometimes we take for granted we talk about how easy we have it there's not people coming in here with clubs and stones and turning Bulls loose in the back door but listen to what he says this is amazing to me all that happened and he says of himself that he could not remember to have felt lowness of spirit for even a quarter of an hour that's 15 minutes since he was born the way you feel I'm going to say this and I understand it's a blanket statement don't get me wrong we have bad days we have but you have a choice you have a choice if you want to walk around moping you have a choice if you go through hardships with your head held high he couldn't remember feeling lowness of spirit for 15 minutes since he was born he slept no more than six hours a day arose in time to start preaching at 5: all right first of all I'm not going to be here to preach at 5 Sunday but if I was I wonder how many of y'all would be here with me yeah don't lie we're in church come on that's right start preaching at 5: every day of his ministry preached up to four times a day so that in a year he averaged 800 sermons I say Lord give give us more Zeal Lord give us more Fire Lord give us more Drive we're right here at the Crossing of the Finish Line we've been given more than anybody's everever we got more fuel to put in the tank than anybody's everever had before and we got people in the past ages that have really outshined us I say I'll speak for me Lord help me help me have more Zeal help me have more fire help me be willing to go wherever you want me to go and do whatever you want me to do and not get lowly in spirit and not get put out and put down we're going to have disagreements we're we're going to have rough days we're going to have bad days but I'm saved by the blood of Jesus Christ I'm called and chosen I got a body change coming I got a Rapture coming my children are going to be there my family's going to be saved I got so many promises the seals have been opened what do I have to be lowly about Hallelujah we are without excuse with everything that the Lord has given us in this day and if you look at the scripture trials and tribulations and attacks aren't even an excuse for us to have a bad attitude or a low attitude or a down attitude they're not an excuse for woe is me James 1:2 my brethren count it all depressing count it all joy yeah when you fall into diverse Temptations I goes that's counterintuitive to the human mind that don't make no sense well that's because we're looking at it through human eyes but he explains why knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience John 16:33 these things I have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulations but be of good cheer you're going to have troubles but be of good cheer look John Wesley lived these verses and God used him mightily despite the oppos position despite the attacks the work went on and it was a mighty work the spirit of God was manifested the the sick were prayed for with Incredible results listen listen laying hands on the sick and they shall recover that's worked ever since the day it was spoken and it hadn't quit working in this day I'm telling you it's not time to back off our promises it's not time to back off the word it's not time to expect to see less of the power of God listen we're coming up on the day where I got to have faith for this body to change back into a young man for an entire sweep to come over and there the greatest Divine Healing that's ever taken place is the change of the body of the Bride of Jesus Christ worldwide and you think it's going to get less and less no no no no it's going to get more and more and more and more and it's going to build up to that day when each and every one of us receive the greatest Divine Healing that's ever taken place on the face of the Earth I'm looking for more of God more power more healing more Deliverance more than I've ever seen before he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so I say if it work then it'll work today and it's also going to work for you tomorrow what's the key to the whole thing he doesn't change if he did it one way brother Brown said he's obligated to continue doing it the same way if he ever was he still is if he ever was he still is my children are lost if he ever was a savior he still is well there's sickness in my home if he ever was a Healer he still is I'm bound tonight with anxiety if he ever was a deliverer he still is tonight Hallelujah that's why he says if the vine puts forth another Branch it'll write another book of Acts because it's going to do the same things amen it's the pattern it's the pattern he makes it very clear in the church age book he says the true church will always try to be like the original at Pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate the first one my so I'm just saying if you're not there if we're not there that don't give us an excuse to not be trying to be he said the true church will always try to be exactly like that first church was the salutation we read this we're going to read it again and we'll probably be in this verse the rest of the evening says unto the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things saith he that is Holy he that is true and he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man open it what an incredible description of our Lord Jesus he's holy he's true he has the Key of David he opens it no man shutteth he shutteth and no man open I'm I'm going to look here at the first part that says he that is Holy I want to look at that what is Holiness you know I think sometimes we have different ideas of you know that that sister she's a really she's really holy or that brother he he has a really holy life and and those are proper ways to use that word for sure but where does the Holiness come from what is it that we're judging as holy because if we don't know a person maybe we're judging by their outward appearance things of that nature maybe conversations you've had you can pick up real quick I'll say this you can pick up real quick if somebody's not holy you can pick that up real quick but what is Holiness because Wesley himself he lived a very clean life he lived what we would call a holy life a life of sacrifice a life of self-denial and yet he goes to America on a mission trip and it's a complete failure it's a complete failure and on the way back he makes this statement or when he gets back he says I went to America to convert the Indians he says but oh who shall convert me because he began to realize that all the rules he was following all the meth methods he was following all the Holiness that he could put on and there was no God there it actually angered his brother when he started telling his brother Charles I got to get saved his brother it upset him because he's like he knew the life he lived he's like if this isn't saved then what is but could that not have we said the same thing about the Pharisees if that isn't holy then they dressed perfect they follow the law perfect but the problem is they were doing it Wesley was doing it it was him that was doing it see he began to realize there was no Holiness in his works there was no Holiness in his self-denial but then he got the Revelation that it wasn't in the dos and the don'ts it wasn't in the rules and the regulations although don't don't get it twisted we believe in In Living a a a clean life according to the word of God Amen we we believe in that but true sanctification is a work of Grace and once he came to that realization then brother Brown says he was born again then he was truly saved brother Brown says what did the Lutheran do after the death of Luther that they met Satan and they made a denomination out of it and they died she never done anything else after that she was done he says but then God picked her up again in the days of John Wesley with with another truth to reflect what did he do he said sanctification is the second work of Grace and what did God do he blessed it see Holiness is of the Lord there's nothing you can do tonight that's holy the only one that's Holiness is the Lord our only source of Holiness is the Lord listen you can you can dress to the tea you can do everything right you can walk around the most Pious person in the world and your heart full of absolute evil I've said it before you can you can live life to a perfect te and have somebody that has in your eyes standards a little lower than your own and they have the Holy Ghost and you not because it's what you're doing it's what you're putting on you can't produce Holiness yourself he is the only source of Holiness amen these things saith he that is Holy see that's where the Jews made their mistake brother brownon this is this is Brother Brown speaking the Jews did not call him holy then they do not call him holy now but he is the Holy One Psalms 16 and10 for thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption now he's talking about the Jews they sought their their righteousness after the law and failed miserably for by the law can no flesh be justified by the law can no man be made holy Holiness is of the Lord they had all the works they had all the sacrifices And yet when the Holy One came they rejected him when the one who could truly make them holy came they turned it down it was Christ or perish and brother brand says they perished because they refused him church it's Christ or perish today it's Christ or listen in their day they found refuge in their synagogue worship and that's where they found their refuge and in the in the day of Philadelphia that they found refuge in their new big organizations and in their churches and and they joined the church and that's where they found Refuge listen don't find Refuge because you believe the message don't find Refuge cuz you go to a message Church you haven't found Refuge because you go to evening light Tabernacle there is but one place of Refuge you got to get into Jesus Christ you got to know Jesus Christ you got to let him change your life and let him change you from the inside it's a work of Grace you can sit here every service and I hope you do sit here every service but that's not it you got to let the word change you and mold you into the image of Christ amen hallelujah there's no holiness and saying I believe the message you must be born again brother Brown says it's not join a church that counts the life is not in the church the life is in Christ this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life man is made holy by the spirit it is the spirit of Holiness that raised Jesus from the dead that indwells us and makes us holy with his Holiness so what is Holiness what is true sanctification it's God working in you not you working to please God God working in you not you working to please God he's the Holy One and it's it's his work in you that will produce a true sanctification a true sanctification brother brand says oh I'm so glad that my Holiness is not of myself oh thank you Jesus I'd be in a bad place tonight I'd be in a bad place tonight he says I'm glad that I'm in Christ and with all his wonderful attributes of righteousness imputed yay imparted unto me blessed be God forever I'm thankful tonight that it's all in him aren't you amen the next part of Revelation 37 that we read said he that is true and as I studied this it was a huge Enlightenment to me because I looked at it as true versus false he's true because he's not false he's not a liar he tells the truth and there's nothing wrong with seeing it that way but brother Brown says that's not what this word means he says here these things saith he that is true now this word true is a very wonderful word it does not mean true in just the sense that is opposite to false it expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with its partial realization now we'll go into it a little deeper but just so so you instantly know where we're at all the scriptures of the Old Testament being partial when he came he was the fullness of all that so he was truth he was all of it he was the perfect realization of what each one of those had in part so he is the truth he's the perfect realization of everything amen so I want you to notice these scriptures here as we look at them with that thought in mind of what the word true means because it's Jesus that is true or Jesus is the perfect realization of what was only a partial type look at these then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from Heaven bread that you won't hunger again because this is true bread that was partial this is true this is the perfect realization of what he was trying to tell you back there I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman 1 John 2:8 again a new commandment I write unto you which thing is true in him and in you because the darkness is pass and the True Light now shineth so I want to go back to what I just made comment on we'll look at Mana for just a second Mana was Angels food sent down from heaven but it didn't actually satisfy not not long term it was good for a day it worked for one day and if and and you got hungry again the next day that's how it tends to happen and if you left it over it would spoil and and ruin it was only good for a moment and those who ate it got hungry again he fed 5,000 with bread that mana and that bread were only partial realizations it was a partial realization of a truth that God was giving his people look I'm giving you bread but that's ain't this ain't what I want to give you I'm feeding you but this ain't really what I'm wanting to feed you this ain't what it's all about wake up and open your eyes that what I'm really wanting to give you is myself the true bread the living bread the Eternal bread that right there is only going to last a day but if you eat this bread if you drink from this water you'll never thirst again because it's the perfect realization of a partial truth it's the reality of all of it amen John 6:35 and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst brother brand says but Jesus is the true bread from Heaven whereof Mana was just a type and if any man eats of that bread that came from Heaven he'll never hunger again he does not need to come back and eat again the moment he partook he had eternal life here indeed was reality no no no need any longer for a shadow need for partial salvation here is the whole of it just like Jesus isn't part of God He Is God When Jesus came there was there was no need for a shadow anymore there was no need to say when he comes he'll be like this and when he comes he'll be like that no here he was he was the perfect realization of it I'm telling you there's been a lot of scriptures that says when she comes she'll be like this and when the bride gets here she'll be like this but I'm telling you we're at the place where types and shadows aren't needed anymore because here she is the perfect realization of what was a paral truth down Through the Ages hallelujah hallelujah Israel had light if you go back in Egypt when it was Darkness everywhere who had light Israel when it was dark they had light down through the Old Testament the prophets brought light by the scriptures but when Jesus came that light had been partial brother brandham says it had been but a glowing word he said but when Jesus came the Fulfillment of the light has come and that word broke forth in the brightness of God manifested amongst his people the light was now that had been partial was now manifested in the godhead bodily he was the perfect realization he was all of it they had sacrifices that were partial they had bulls and goats that were partial once again though what was it doing it was pointing to a reality it was pointing to the real thing it it was pointing to the fact that there was a true sacrifice coming and when that sacrifice came and that blood was shed that sacrifice was like you and me so that Spirit was going to come back on the worshipper come back on the believer and it was going to break you free from the law of sin and death and you were going to walk out completely delivered saved Hallelujah set free because it wasn't a partial it was a complete realization of the true sacrifice hey man perfect life had now come and now the believer was free from the law of sin and death brother brandham says but the Jews back there in the time of Jesus did not want to accept that sacrifice the blood of wolves and goats made nothing perfect it was once God's ordained method but now Christ having appeared in the flesh and by the shedding of his own blood has put away sin and by that offering of himself has made us perfect the Jews would not take that but what about the Philadelphian age and yes other ages too did they really accept this reality in Christ no sir even though Luther brought the truth of justification the Roman Church and its eastern counterpart the Orthodox Church still clung to works now works are fine he says but they don't save you they don't make you perfect it's Christ or perish and it's not even Christ and works it's Christ Alone he says now I believe in Good Conduct see because some people can take these and say see our works don't matter that's not what he's saying he says I believe in Good Conduct if you are saved you will do righteously you will do righteously but just because you do righteously doesn't mean you're saved you see he says we have already gone gone over that but let me tell you now salvation is not Jesus plus it is Jesus alone listen guys sometimes we complicate things I thank God for the Mysteries I thank God the seals are open I believe we should preach it I believe we should teach it but every now and then it's good to just remember salvation is in Jesus alone those who believe on the Lord shall be saved look I believe in teaching people the Mysteries but let's get them to Calvary let's get them to Jesus Christ let's get them saved let's Point them once again it's not complicated just repent of your sins lay them down at the altar be washed in the blood of Jesus and you shall be saved it's simple salvation is of the Lord from start to finish it's all God let his life be in me let it be his blood that cleanses me let it be his spirit that fills me let it be his word in my heart and mouth let it be his stripes that heal me Let It Be Jesus and Jesus alone not by works of righteousness which I have done no sir Christ is my life amen so Jesus is he that is true he is the perfect realization of the truth that God satisfies our every need he's the perfect realization of the truth that God satisfies our every thirst and satisfies our every desire Perfection or let me say it to you even like this completion is in Christ men here of you many young people hungering and thirsting for that completion that that satisfa it's in Christ that's where you're going to find it without him we can do nothing I want to encourage you I I say this to the young people but it's not too late if you're an old person give your hopes to Jesus give your dreams to Jesus give your Ambitions to Jesus give your marriage to Jesus give everything you've got to Jesus seek ye first the kingdom of God then the rest of the stuff he's not saying that you know you can't have those things he's not saying you can't have a good job and a good home and you can't go on vacation that's not what he's saying seek ye first the kingdom of God I'll add all this other stuff to you I'll give you all this other stuff but first fall in love with Jesus make him your everything he alone can satisfy your heart's desire once you have him you have everything but if you don't have him you've got nothing the next part says that he that has the Key of David now I put both scriptures up here we've already read Revelation 3:7 but I just want you to notice how similar they are where it says these things I'm on the bottom when these things saith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shth and shth and no man openeth go back to Isaiah 22:22 and the key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shall shut and he shall shut and None Shall open notice how similar they are here brother Brown says this scripture has to do with our Lord after his resurrection not his Earthly pilgrimage he says but what does this key signify and I love I love this part the answer lies in the position of the key where is the key it's on his shoulder but what does his shoulder have to do with it think about who carries the key on the their shoulder for under us a child is born un us a son is given given the government shall be upon his shoulder his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace and what brother Bram says here we're looking at it we're thinking politics government on his shoulder you know that's how the Jews looked at it they never recognized it as a love story they thought he was going to come overthrow the Romans and set up this Earthly government it's a love story and brother brandham takes it back to wedding ceremonies of the East and he says what it is is when the bride has committed to the groom she takes her veil off and lays it across his shoulder why it shows that he is now her head and that he if he allows her to do that he is accepting responsibility for her her he's going to care for her he's going to provide for her he's going to protect her no one else has any say in her responsibility little bride you've got a great provider little bride you've got a great protector you got one watching over your children tonight you got one watching over your home the devil's brought an attack that's okay you got a protector tonight you got one that says I'm going to heal you already I took responsibility for you I promise to watch it I know money's getting tight but I'm a provider I said i' take care of it I'm the one responsible for your needs amen thank you Lord Brother Brown says she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he's talking about Christ and the bride he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and to him alone she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation that right there fires me up brother Aaron I got so much trouble in my life he accepts the obligation you my life falling apart he has accepted the obligation I'm torn down I've made so many Stakes mistakes I don't know where to stand he accepts the obligation tonight he says I got you I got you just trust in me don't forget whose hands is holding you tonight he is her head for Christ is the head of his church as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that he is her Lord he speaks and she obeys for that is her Delight just want to drop this in here if you're in that place to where keeping the word of God is a struggle and it's a burden to you we need to find a place of repentance because doing what he asked is her Delight he says my burden my yoke is light because we love to do it because of all he did for us we love to do it now look let's be real it says when you eat up the book it's going to make your belly bitter there's things that don't always sit well and you're like that hurts a little bit that didn't feel good but we don't do it begrudgingly well I guess I have to no we love him and we know all he's done for us so we're willing Lord what whatever makes you happy Lord whatever pleases you and that's the place we got to get even in life and I thought about this a lot recently with my own self we don't want to get into a place where we're saying does God really care if I do this does God really God probably ain't G to send you to hell for it I don't even know what we're talking about they might I don't know what you're thinking about but I'm just talking about those things that you don't know you're can I get away with it why are we wondering that the question we should ask ourselves is does this please him does this please God Amen so it's Christ that has the key not a church hierarchy not a pope not a preacher nobody controls this bride he controls this bride this bride ain't going to be manhandled this bride ain't going to be put underneath a a man's thumb the devil don't have no say in this he says he's the one that opens and he's the one that shuts the devil can't put you out listen the devil keeps telling you're not going to make it you're not good enough you're not going to make it you're not good listen the devil don't get a say the devil don't have a key to his own house much less the house I'm going to he was stripped of the keys of death and hell he don't even have keys to his own house but the man who holds the key to tonight said I can come in the man who owes the key tonight said you're going to make it I've opened the door and I'm not shutting it on you come on in come on in but I'm struggling I'm holding the door open for you tonight the man who has the key said you can come in Hallelujah can't no devil keep you out can't no church keep you out can't no preacher keep you out the door is open you just got to come into the door tonight quit listening to all the other voices there's one voice tonight call call in your name and he says I open the door and I shut the door no other man can close it tonight Hallelujah Christ has the key and he's opened the door for you and no man can shut it he's accepted responsibility for your life tonight brother Bram says he bought the bride he owns her she is his and his alone he cares for her he is our King and I love this and we are his kingdom his eternal possession amen next part verse eight talks about the age of the open door and this will this will be the last section that we'll cover tonight says I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an Open Door no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name now remember at the very beginning I I said how brother Bram talks about the ages overlapping and we're not going to get much into the overlap tonight or if at all but here brother brandham really begins to to to lay in on that point as he goes into this verse and he says there is an overlapping a melting or Fading Into rather than an Abrupt end and a clearcut start he says this age particularly flows into the next age that would be our age Le Osa now listen to this not only does this age overflow into the last age but the last age is in many respects simply a carrying on of the sixth age so with that in mind there's so many things being spoken to the sixth age that we can take and apply because it's just a carrying on into the seventh age he he spends a lot of time here also focusing on the open door that no man can shut and he deals with it in sever several different ways but tonight we're only going to have time to deal with the first one and and he starts by looking at the open door as signifying the great missionary effort that went out during the Philadelphia age because Paul had spoken uh one of his missionary trips where he had the opportunity to go somewhere and and I'm off of memory can't remember it but he says a door was open unto me in other words I had the opportunity to go and Minister and and and so brother brand says this Open Door signifying the great missionary effort that went out during the Philadelphia age he says they opened up many doors during that age the door to the gospel the door to the mission Fields the door back to Christ and everything was opened up during that age and you can see what they did the Brethren done a great job out of it it was the greatest spreading of the word that the world had ever seen Luther began to open that door in the previous age but it's during this age the doors just busted wide open and men with a burden begin to take the word around the world it's the age of you've heard the term the Great Awakening it's the age of the Great Awakening men like George Whitefield Jonathan Edwards Charles finny it was it was the open door to truth and it began to spread like wildfire but brother Brown makes an interesting statement I just want to bring this down to us tonight as we begin to wind this down he says the word of the Lord now has its day he's talking about then of course the fifth age had set the stage for this Mighty move as that age gave us exploration colonization the printing of books Etc so he says the word of the Lord has had its day now I want to ask you a simple question question maybe not so simple how should the gospel be preached is there a a way no I'm not talking about a style I understand there's teachers there's people that get really really really really excited there's people that get kind of excited there there's all kind of different styles of delivery I'm not talking about a style of delivery I'm talking about what should the gospel come with what should accompany in it because he didn't say go get give lectures he was very specific about how the gospel was supposed to go forth amen well we we just need to to give them the word and we just need to tell them about Jesus and and tell them that God sent a prophet if you do those things those things are great not here to knock any of that but just notice he says for the past 150 years great missionaries like of no other time or age before has covered the entire Earth think of that every nation under the heavens has heard the word that's what the prophet said every nation has heard the word it completed many many many years ago well there's a lot of people going we got to get the word out we got to get the word out I'm not going to argue with you I'm just saying he said that was completed many many many years ago see but not the gospel wait what there's a difference absolutely because the gospel comes in power and demonstration the letter kth but the spirit giveth life see my he actually comments right here and I didn't put it in a slide he said he he he commends the age for all that they did and says but it's too bad they didn't do it according to the pattern of Pentecost where the power of God is demonstrated where the power of God is preached to the people where Mark 16 is put in action don't let that ever be said about us that that that we we give people the word but there's no power there's no gospel in it because it's supposed to be delivered like like brother brandham says Mark 16 in action is the true church he says all else is false it has to be it's a direct quote so what is 16 in action these signs shall follow them that believe they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover what's the Bible say the Bible says and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them confirming the word with signs following amen he never said go start a program I actually have a direct quote right here from Brother Bram he never said Go pass out literature not against that he's just telling you that's not preaching the gospel that's all he's saying he's not saying those things aren't good matter of fact he makes it a point to say that's fine but that's not what he meant when he said go preach the gospel into the whole world he said preach the gospel and signs will follow why because our ministry is supposed to be when I say our our not just the pull pit our ministry is to be a continuation of the ministry of Christ and when you read how his ministry went it says he went about to all the cities teaching preaching healing every sickness and every disease amongst the people and then he says John 14:12 The Works that I do shall you do also brother Brown says yes the Bible Way is the real way of the open door we can't be satisfied with the power of God laying dormant we can't be satisfied putting those things on a shelf but he don't heal like he used to yes he does he doesn't change he doesn't save like he used to yes he does he doesn't change he doesn't fill people with the Holy Ghost like he did in the upper room yes he does he does not change we've got to stick with the original pattern amen he goes in he he spends the next Pages talking about his trip to South Africa there in Durban he says there was over 100,000 people in attendance and I'm going to just summarize this for you briefly he said there was a missionary there there with him and he told Brother Bram that he had seen one muhamad converted in 30 years one that was his life's work was 30 years there and he had one convert brother Brown says it's like a packed amongst them once a muhammadan always a muhammadan they stick together and so brother brandham gets up there and he asks the crowd he says have the missionaries he holds up the Bible read to you out of this book and all the missionaries were there and he says through the translators the people respond yes he says' and have they told you that Jesus came to save you and they all said yes now you got to understand he's dealing with people that they've been told this but they don't believe none of them have converted but they've been told the word over and over 30 years he said but did they also tell you that this same Jesus was a mighty healer and that he would live in his people down Through the Ages until he came again to receive them unto himself did they tell you that because of that same spirit in them that was in Jesus that they would be able to do Mighty works even as Jesus did did they tell you that you can be healed even as you can be saved how many of you would like to see the same Jesus come down amongst us and do the same thing that he did when he was here on Earth long to go they all wanted that they all listen the world that'll make the world thirsty you show them a living God and not just a dead letter you begin to let them know that God still heals God still delivers look I'll never forget I was asked to give a a devotion one time at a little basketball game where Jude was playing and I'm sitting there in front of several hundred Baptist folks man I got to testifying about Jude's kidney being healed and how God created new kidneys in his body and I was just talking about it and you could heard a pin drop except for this one old woman she must have been like 80 and she was over in the corner going amen yay man I'm like hey I got one I'll get one listen if it only touches one tell them about it God still heals God still saves he's the same the same way you can be saved you can be healed the same way you were saved you can be delivered the power has not changed he said they all wanted that and so he had a sister right there and he begins to speak with this sister and he begins to discern her by the power of the Holy Ghost and he begins to tell her her trouble what the doctors found what the doctor looked like what the diagnosis was he says I asked her and this is after he discerned her how is it you came to me a Christian why didn't you go to your Muhammad and Prophet she said I think you can help me I said I can't help you but if you receive Jesus Christ as your savior he who is here now and knows all about you he'll help you she said I accept Jesus as my savior that did it see how simple it is that did it now notice he didn't stand up there and break down all the doctrines and break you know what he did he showed them a living Christ he showed them a living God and the next part says she was healed and about 10,000 muhammadans came to Christ that day because the gospel was preached in both word and power God never told a man to labor 30 years and harvest nothing my he gave us the open door of word and power and that is what we're supposed to use I say Get It Off the Shelf tonight we got something we're supposed to use we got word we got power we got mechanics we got Dynamics we got a power that'll bring the lost in that'll heal the sick that'll relieve your anxiety deliver you from depression he's the same God tonight tonight he says that's what we're supposed to use Hallelujah what' Paul say my preaching was not with enticing words but in demonstration of the spirit and power yes we should preach the word yes we should give them the word but it has to be brought by the original Open Door of Pentecost the open door of word and power church this word has life in it this isn't a dead word this word has life in it it has power in it it'll change your life how many can testify it'll change your life I was a nothing nobody lost and Bound for hell wrapped up in so much sin what a filthy life but one day one moment in his presence changed all of that how frustrating it must be for the devil to pour decade after decade after decade into a life and say I got them covered up there's no way this one's coming out but one moment in the presence of God oh how's he going to get my son one moment how's he going to get my daughter one moment that's all it takes is one moment in the presence of God don't over complicate it don't build it up too high he just needs a moment Hallelujah he just needs a moment why would we want to settle for anything less than the open door of word and power I want it all there's power to overcome in that day brother Brown says the word was well preached but it did not have the open door of power that it ought to have had the power of the spirit was missing he says the power of the spirit was missing in that age the word was well preached he was well able to make Souls wise unto salvation but the great power of God that showed forth his mighty works that made bear his arm in behalf of his own was missing except amongst the scattered groups woo I see myself in this one I see myself there he says yet praise God it was growing and had increased over what they had in the Reformation I read that and I got so excited I thought man that was the last age and the prophet looked at and said it was growing that seed had gone from the ground that went in in Ephesus and it was growing it wasn't there yet but it was growing that there was some life in them scattered groups and you begin to look back now knowing what we know and you can see a foundation being laid you can see a foundation laying a there's there's power about to be restored there's fullness on the horizon there's a message coming promised by Malachi 4 that's going to take the people all the way back to the original and you can look at it there in Philadelphia and say no that ain't it but it's growing that ain't a it but it's growing that ain't it but Satan hadn't been able to stop it the false Vine hadn't been able to stop it listen I going to leave you with this Satan has never been able to stop the plan of God and I got news for you because you're an attribute you are a part of the plan of God that means Satan cannot

which thou Hast that no man take thy Crown I let you know there's people after it there's Spirits after it he says hold on fast you know I look at the church ages and it's just me and and you look back in Ephesus you know that original church that that the word speaks of so highly that brother Bram says it's the pattern and yet they fell and you look at it and you say why' they fall how'd they fall brother Bron makes it clear go back and read the Ephesian age he calls about nickan ism and a hierarchy over the church he said they began to make Church formal and it began to squeeze the life out of it and make it all about just the word of course then they begin to pervert the word as well but at first he said that squeeze the life like a boowa constrictor or a python by making their worship formal by taking the power of God out of and I got to think and I said you know and this is just me but the devil looks around he sees a group of people on the Earth and he says I I ain't seen something like that in 2,000 years I ain't seen a group like that since that first age now how did I get them oh I made them cold I made them formal I made them powerless I made them just focus on just give them the word and if it works in that age I'mma get them again but this eve this bride she's predestinated not to fall we had a Prophet come he told us don't be formal don't be cold keep your fire lit keep your fire lit don't be lukewarm oh stay on fire for God Church ask him toight Lord just rekindle the fire refill me with the Holy Ghost Light me once again don't let me be cold and
