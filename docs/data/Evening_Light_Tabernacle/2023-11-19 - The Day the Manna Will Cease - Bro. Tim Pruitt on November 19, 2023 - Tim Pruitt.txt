spirit is already here we've welcomed you we've sung the songs of Zion Lord we believe that we're in the vein of your anointing today as we just step forward oh God taking authority over every Spirit

anoint the word today anoint our hearts to receive God let us just be anointed today anointed lips circumcised by the Holy Spirit anointed ears circumcised by the Holy Spirit to hear what the spirit

par person don't want let one be lost Lord we know it's the heart of God to save all so Lord we just extend Mercy because you said blessed are the merciful for they shall receive mercy so we extend Mercy Lord let the hungry the the the Desiring Lord the burdened let them come find that that Mercy at the foot of the cross today I ask Lord in Jesus name Direct our words straight to the point in Jesus name amen amen God bless you good to be in the house of the Lord this morning may my what a wonderful time we had yesterday and I want to thank all of you that participated in that and was a part of that you uh you blessed many and we were all blessed and enjoyed it amen and I couldn't be more proud of you and thankful to you for um the provisions that you have provided and the facilities that you provided and helped us to have and whatever we could have such a wonderful time together and it was just wonderful and I could um I want to just say especially brother Timothy sister Lydia they poured out their heart in organizing that and I just um uh just you know we could just see with them and all that others that participated you you know I I think sometimes of the Unseen host and the ones that um maybe work in the be background that you never see they're never visible you know so it's kind of like um heart and lungs and liver and you know intestines things you don't ever see but they're vitally important you know and so that's the way it is every one of you are important to the body of Christ and we want to say we appreciate you very very much I I think about how often the the brothers up in the sound booth and the security cameras and recordings and and the overhead for the Sisters there that different ones that help you know how how important you are in making this service what it is musicians and uh deacons trustees and you the worshipper coming together without you I'll tell you what Co showed me it's hard to preach to an empty building you know and and I I really I really love to see um you know people to preach to amen I uh had my first experience of that really you know when I was in Uganda and they asked me to preach to on the radio and and so they would give me a signal you know to start here and then you know it was a free uh program so we had to break for a commercial and so you know you speak for a few minutes and he'd give you the signal and you had to wind down your thought and then and and bring it to and then the commercial and then pick up your thought and go again I'm glad we don't have to break for commercials here amen I'll take a break anytime with shouting and rejoicing in the things of God but no commercials here okay amen other than worshiping our lord Jesus who gave It All To Us amen we'll break for our sponsor right now the Lord Jesus provided all of this for you by by his grace amen amen amen we so love the Lord and so love you and so appreciate you will you turn with me to Joshua chapter 5 and and verse 10 and let's just um look in the things of God today have several scriptures I want to read maybe uh won't keep his standing long but we we stand like this not in honor cuz I come out you know that but in honor for the for the reading of the word of God they did this in the book of Ezra and when they read the law the people stood and worshiped God so you know many stand in honor to the flag and salute the flag and we are standing here to salute the word of God and to lift it high and say it's a holy word and it's applicable for our day for our hour we can look in this and see and we'll be looking at it today and see that it's prophecy and then we are the interpretation of that so when we talk about types and fulfillment of types that's what we're talking about type is is a shadow I wish I could show you a shadow how how the light you know comes and and and something gets in the way of the light and as it's approaching though you know it puts a shadow and and so the shadow is what we're reading in the Bible it's a foreshadowing as Paul said these things are an example of things to come and and so he would look in there and actually pull from there things that he could see was being fulfilled in his hour that's why we go to the Bible like we do it's not just reading history it's not just reading uh something in the old text or what no it's a prophecy it's a shadow because something greater was coming you see and it's just portraying that which is coming you can look at the Shadow and get an idea of what is promised and what's being fulfilled so you know Paul would speak of this uh Jesus would use Parables and Paul would say these things were given to you for examples and and so then he would use these uh the things that happened in the heavens and Moses saw was a pattern of what he built the temple on the Earth all these things that are laid in there for our understanding now let's go to Joshua chap 5 and verse 10 and the children of Israel encamped in gilgal and kept the Passover on the 14th day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the marrow after the Passover unle cakes and parched corn in the self same day and and the Mana ceased on the tomorrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of Israel Mana anymore but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year God bless you you can be seated and if you will kindly turn with me to Exodus chapter 16 and we'll read from verse 14 to just continue some of the scriptures that I want to reference today so um this is of course after they have left Egypt now they've cross through the Red Sea and and uh you know the enemies is dead and so here comes um the outpouring of God's blessings look at verse 14 Exodus 16:14 and when the Dew that lay was going up behold upon the face of the Wilderness there lay a small round thing as small as the hor frost on the ground and when the children of Israel saw it they said to one another it is mana and for they wish not what it was it actually means uh what is this you know they didn't know what it was this had never been seen before and Moses said unto them this is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat and this is the thing which the Lord hath commanded gather it of every man according to his eating and Homer for every man according to the number of your persons take ye every man for them which are in his tents and the children of Israel did so and gathered some more some less and when they did meet it with an OM he that gathered much had nothing left over and he that gathered little Had No Lack and they gathered every man according to his eating and Moses said let no man leave of it till the morning not withstanding they hearkened not to Moses but some of them left of it until the morning and it bred worms and stank and Moses was wroth with them skip down to verse 31 now and the house of Israel called called the name thereof mana and it was like coriander seed White and the taste of it was like Wafers made with honey and Moses said this is the thing which the Lord commandeth fill an of it to be kept for your Generations that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt and Moses said unto a Aon take the pot take a pot and put a full of Mana therein and lay it up before the Lord to be kept for your generations and as the Lord commanded Moses so Aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept and the children of Israel did eat Mana 40 years until they came to a land inhabited they did eat Mana until they came unto the borders of the land land of Canaan amen now I'm going to speak to you this morning on as you saw us in in Joshua's account and they had come into the canaan's land and there the Mana ceased I'm going to speak today on the day that Mana will cease so you know Mana would have had to be a complete diet it had to be full of minerals and vitamins and you know eating eating on it the Bible tells us that none would be old or feeble Psalms 105:37 where he records that the Egyptians were stripped and he brought them forth with um um silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes so you see they when God brought them out he not only brought them out but they got back pay for the years and years of slavery you know I I I think of that a lot of times we think about coming to Christ and oh well we're going to have to pay for all the sins and the problems and the the things of our past but actually you know the this type shows you you're going to get some back pay what the devil has taken from you God is about to restore and he's going to do more than that but you're going to get the blessings the back PID that the devil robbed of you how many's ready for some back payback amen that you know things that the devil has stolen from you and taken from you that God is about not just to restore you but give you extra blessings send you back with the back pay as the Bible said they would leave out with the gold and silver I mean they stripped the Egyptians as they borrowed every man for their neighbor but you know they wouldn't stealing anything they was actually getting payment for the years and years of slavery and the blessings of God when God gives you the blessings of Calvary he brings it such abundance such greatness until you you can start expecting some paybacks instead of still suffering because of your past you look back and say no you know for those years that I I've spent in slavery and in sin and darkness and whipped by the devil I'm expecting some Payback amen for the blessings of God to be come upon my life upon my home upon my upon anything my family a restoration but more than restoration payback amen and I'm looking for a great day when a real payback's coming now the of course um as we see the Holy Ghost is our Mana today which is the word made spirit and power and it has sustaining strength and power in it the Divine energy for the journey so that there won't be one feeble one among us but all strong committed faithful Christians that's what God wants in his in his people amen we Invision of people that are not feeble that are not weak Christians but strong Believers in the faith knows where they stand because they are partaking of heavenly mana and that Mana has all the vitamins and all the minerals and everything needed for the journey in Psalm 78 and verse 23 he said though he commanded the clouds from above and opened the doors of heaven isn't this wonderful God opening the doors of heaven and rained down Mana upon them to eat had given them the corn of Heaven man did eat Angels food he sent them meat to the full now of course that's not only promised in the Old Testament but it's also promised in the new so let's look over here in Revelation 2:17 where to the Overcomer is also given mana and he that ha an ear let him hear what the spirit said to the churches to him that overcometh will I give to E e of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and that stone a new name written which no man knoweth sa in he that receives it so you see it's not just Mana that Falls Daily but Mana that is also stored up behind the veil that only the priest could eat for he ha made us under our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign upon the Earth for you are a holy nation a royal priesthood that we should show forth the Praises of him who have called us out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light now as we said about types A type can be used in many ways in our message today we're going to type leaving Egypt which was leaving the law and going into Grace the gospel of grace now has taken us down a long journey through seven Church ages and and of course we're now here at the end of the Ages which is the leoan age and and and of course we're we're here on the edge now as we type it this way this morning of the promised land in the Millennium ahead when we will enter the millennial Reign and that's when the Mana will cease the Holy Ghost is the Mana that we have received and it will and will it will cease falling and there will be no more Mana now if you're a student of the message you know the promised land types the Holy Ghost and and not the Millennium but in this case it does and I have many quotes where brother bradam uses it in this way as regarded to the subject at hand so the the the use of the type today will type Mana as the Holy Ghost and the land that we're going to the Millennium amen so now Israel has left Egypt and has journeyed through the Wilderness they are sustained by a daily outpouring of Mana from Heaven they will go from Passover in Egypt to experience Passover again as soon as they enter into the promised land the first Passover in Egypt and then the first Passover in the promised land and we too we go from Passover to Passover amen there at just before Jesus would go to Calvary of course you know he was a Passover Lamb and he celebrates the Passover with his disciples and and he says the fruit of the Vine I won't drink it with you again until I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom so Matthew 26:26 it tells of the account of the Passover and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and and break it and gave it to his disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them and said drink you all of it and and he says for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but I say unto you I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day that I will drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom so again here again you know we we see Israel coming now into the promised land and the first thing they do is celebrate the Passover and when we get home oh I look for the time when we get home when we enter into the millennial Reign and and peace comes upon the Earth and we enter into into that blessed r oh where God has had it in his mind before the foundational world have his kingdom here upon the earth and the great Millennial Reign and we long today with ancient heart thinking of the great time where we'll sit together at the Lord's supper and drink the fruit of the vine and eat a new the food in the Kingdom oh my to sit at that table described as a table thousands of miles long where we look across at each other and we shake one another's hands and little tear drop run down our cheek yes Hallelujah as we look at at one another and say here we are celebrating celebrating what Calvary did for us celebrating the lamb remembering remember what brought us into this Kingdom and the tears come down our face and hear the king will come down and with his in his white robe and walk around the table and wipe all the tears from our eyes what a day that's going to be where he'll say enter into the joys of the lord it's been prepared for you since the foundation of the world now this type represents Christ who is our Passover and he is the bread for the Passover and the drink notice he is also the bread for our journey you remember just as just as they had bread for their journey and we're on the way and we have been on the way through the Wilderness from Seven Church ages and now about to enter into the the great coming of the Lord and the marriage supper of the Lamb that we just described in the and and then again into the the millennium ahe but listen Jesus declares himself as that bread look here in John 6:48 I am that bread of life amen your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead but this is the bread which cometh down from heaven a man that a man may eat thereof and not die I am the living bread which came down from heaven if a man eateth this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world as a living father has sent me I live by the father and so he that eateth me even shall live by me and this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever so we know what the bread is it's eternal life amen it's the very Spirit of Jesus how in the world else could you eat him you can't eat his his literal flesh or drink his literal blood but you can receive his life into you and the strength of that and the strength coming from him is for the journey notice that this Mana it fell on the day of Pentecost when God opened up the windows of Heaven amen as we read there in Psalms 78 23 though he had commanded the clouds from heaven above and opened the doors of heaven and rained down Mana from upon them to eat and given them of the Corn of Heaven you see what a beautiful type this is because the same thing happens for the New Testament Church after you come through the Red Sea of sanctification after you leave the Egypt of the world and and you pass through the Red Sea what happens when the heavens open and when the heaven open what happened there come a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind amen and the and the bread came down from heaven holy Mana the spirit of God the D that the church has to live upon amen and that Holy Ghost was poured out hallelujah it's our life sustaining resource that only comes by the Holy Ghost and as soon as the OST Les had crossed out all the fear and the doubt and the confusion and gathered in the upper room God gave them the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when it fell down it was our Mana coming from God out of Heaven it came like a rushan Mighty Wind and all the house that they were sitting clothing tongues like fire set upon them amen just think about that this is the Holy Ghost amen this is the very spirit of God coming down and as he does he divides each one his portion hallelujah amen there's enough for all

will prophesy amen come on Amen they will D they old old men will dream dreams and young men will see Visions because I'm going to pour out my spirit I'll tell you there's enough of Mana for today he hasn't run out and windows of heaven will open even this morning in this church and feel ever hungry Soul Hallelujah there's enough for the journey every day every day every day of your Christian life not just one day a week but every day Hallelujah sustainance strength empowering vitamins hallelujah amen God working miracles yes sir as they went out testifying of the what God had done oh my but

children there's Mana for those that are far off Hallelujah as many as the Lord Our God shall call Hallelujah that means there's Mana stored up even for every generation hall hallelujah amen doesn't matter if maybe ain't F falling out in the world and maybe it ain't fallen out there maybe it ain't never fell in your home and a but you can come behind the veil Hallelujah there is Mana that's been stored up for every generation that's huah that every person every person then when you're born again of the spirit of God you become a priest remember behind the veil it was only for a priest only for the priest nobody else could go there but a priest that's but when you're born again you are a royal priesthood a holy nation called to God to be priest and King somebody help me preach amen and then you have a right to go behind the veil and there get some of the original Mana the same thing they got on the day of Pentecost you can have it too you can get not just a whole mouthful amen but a

that he said what does it represent all us all when they got drunk on this new Mana oh you said oh now wait a minute brother Tim mana mana was corand seed like and it was just bread no remember the bread we get has wine and bread come on Amen now so brother Brandon talks about this Hallelujah and just to quote him he says the Holy Ghost Gospel is nothing but one great big Powerhouse of joy and I didn't tell him to put that up there amen God did the Holy Ghost Gospel is a perfect intoxication for every man that's got the blues hallelujah amen we all get the blues Elijah Got the Blues Brother bam got the blues but I tell you if you go to eatting on this you go to drinking on this it's the perfect intoxication where you forget your Blues all your worries you can cast all your cares on him because he cares for you he cares for you well the doctor gave me up the doctor said I have kidney disease the doctor says I have cancer the doctor said well the doctor said all of this and it's enough to give you the blues but let me tell you something I can read right here I am the Lord God that Health all of thy diseases cast all your cares on me because I care for you I tell you we are we are serving a God who cares he cares about the young he cares about the old he cares about the teenager and the trial that they're going through this is a God that cares about the drugs he cares about the homosexual he cares he cares he's a God that save he's a God that delivers he's a God that set free this is a god who's not willing that any should perish amen you take a drink of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and be filled with the Holy Ghost you're drunk until you leave this world amen I hope I'm preaching to a bunch of drunk people this morning amen I I tell you the Bible tells you that you're going to be drunk one way or the other amen there are some that are going to be drunk on the martyrs of the Saints we got we got evil people in this world that are drunk on the Marty of the Jews hey that that they're drunk on it are you with me we got others that are drunk on the on the the on the on the wine of the fornication of the great that has poured out her false doctrines to the ages and they're drunk on it so you going to be drunk on something why not be drunk on the spirit why I get so filled with the Holy Ghost until you forget your blues and be filled with the joy until you leave this world joy unspeakable and full of Glory there's a constant stimulation it's a constant intoxication D drunk day and night amen that's the word of God Amen now the Bible equates this with the spirit it had the same effect as wine now you know I I know a lot of times you preach like this and you think you know people come across well you know you're I I tell you what you're you're just not a very revelated Church you're not really revelated you know you you're you're way back behind you're you're Pentecostal you better be Pentecostal or you're not saved amen that's God's original way that's the way the church starts out that's the way church has to end whatever planet is what comes up and if you got something is being produced in your church other than Pentecost it is not the Holy Ghost it ain't the word of God Amen now the now brother brandham when he goes to preach the third and the fourth seal as the mysteries of God are being broken now the Deep mystery truth broke into the people people brought out in the scripture amen and and and as he brings out the scripture of the black horse rider and he goes forth to conquer with his Darkness are you with me now and as he does he goes to block out with Darkness the knowledge of the word with a with a black horse rider but there's something that screamed forth during in that time of darkness and it comes from the very heart of the Lamb himself and it screams out but don't you hurt the oil and the wine now how can you say you have true Revelation and the oil of the Holy Spirit and the wine of Revelation isn't there to stimulate the believer now I I mean in too many message is it's dead dead dead dead amen now this is supposed to be a restored brid tree not a dead brid tree she was eat down to a stump remember amen but this is supposed to be the restoration of the brid tree not the desecration of the brid tree so he said in there in restoration of the Bride tree As He restored it he says so we look that the Antichrist that old worm that that old Palmer worm or caterpillar he took away the joy you know David one time lost the joy of his salvation he didn't lose his salvation but he just lost the joy of it and he cried Lord restore to me the joy of my salvation there's something that we ought to be able to cry out to God today if we're saved Lord just give me some more joy amen so this little p wor begin to eat that fruit of joy out now look here you people make too much noise I'm quoting I tell you all this crying saying amen and this shouting that's nonsense there's nothing to that the first thing you know he sat in a big morg you know sitting there them all dead that's right some of these emalin fluids of so-called doctrine of Creeds pumped up in their veins where the spirit of God ought to be running hello were the old church Creed pumped in there no wonder they're icy cold and dead spiritual thermometer 90 de below zero yeah somebody say amen and everybody stretched their neck around like some Goose want to know why who said that it's a shame but when the spirit of God ought to be joy peace and love but this little old bug started eating on it and he ate all the joy away well I tell you what it's a shame to say but many of they're so ate down thinking they got a knowledge of the message and this knowledge of the message you know the letter has killed him and there's no Spirit left it all but listen to what he said in the third seal as as this was being broke open hurt not the oil of the wine he said when a truth of the promised word of God has been truly revealed to his saints that is filled with oil that's the Holy Ghost you know they all get stimulated amen wine is a stimulation Glory I feel it right now same effect amen stimulated with shouts and joy and when it does it has a same effect oh listen to this the same effect upon them that winders on the natural man woo Amen brother when you get this Bread of Heaven amen it is not just the bread it's the wine that goes with it come on Amen because in this when the Mana comes down it's it's not just dead word come on it is it is not dead letter that kills it's the spirit that makes alive and when it does brother it brings out the shouts of Hallelujah the glory to God I was once lost in sin I was once sick with cancer I was once bound I was once defeated but now I'm alive in Christ Jesus hallelujah oh he says wine is a stimulation Glory I feel it right now amen it has the same effect upon them that wine does upon a natural man woo the same effect that wine does on a natural man because when the Revelation has been given of a truth of God and the True Believer filled with oil and the Revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that it makes him behave himself unnormal that's right Glory it may maybe that's what's matter with them now that's right it makes them behave their themselves unseemingly wo you say well we're a revelation people well I tell you what I can tell a lot of people whatever you're preaching with it's a dud there ain't no zip to it the life has all gone out of it it don't bring any stimulation come on it don't have this same effect on you that wine does Amen why the wine of the Holy Ghost will make you forget all your problems it'll make you love everybody it'll make you shout it'll take away the blues it'll cause you to put your head up high and know you can whip every devil know that you're more than a conqueror know that you are an overcomer know that greater is he that is in you that he that is in the world know who you are know that you're called know that you're ordained know that you have Hallelujah been set free by the glory of God and it'll make you shout and it'll make you behave yourself abnormally oh [Applause] yeah we believe the prophet brother Tim you don't believe this is evidenced by your behavior you never had a drink come on you never got drunk on the spirit you never tasted a new wine now he said if you want to just if you want scripture for this brother brandham just want scripture just start reading acts two what what they have they had the promise that had been given when all the promise of the Holy Spirit was poured out upon them it was scripturally a Vindicated amen what happened it made themel behave unseemingly they were drunk on new wine yes sir come on Amen they came out with a testimony they came out on fire they were not lukewarm and cold and formal I tell you what if your church ain't pattern after Acts 2 it's a dead dead dead [Applause] church amen amen now the Bible said in in Ephesians 5:18 and here he equates it he equates the spirit of God with being drunk on wine watch what he said and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess now he's making a comparison but be filled with the spirit amen be filled with the spirit don't be drunk with wine which is excess but be filled with the spirit so he equates the coming of the spirit with being drunk on wine amen it's a perfect intoxication for anybody that's got the blues amen oh my when you come when you come into the presence of God you'll forget all your troubles amen you'll even love your enemies you make you love everybody it takes all the odd out of your heart come on it causes you to worship and behave yourself unseemingly they get stimulated by Revelation you can tell you know a lot of people's what they call Revelation ain't got no life in it there's no zip in it now I'll just quote brother brandom be not drunk drunk upon strong drink but be drunk on the spirit Hallelujah that's what we need today is an oldfashioned drunken baptism of the Holy Ghost that burns out sin double cure and oldtime Backwoods spy blue sin killing religion amen oh my some of us just really need to get as he called it sa drunk amen do you forget all your troubles do you forget who's who's and what's what and whatever else amen until God becomes so great in your life and the devil becomes so little amen that you're drunk on that new one come on it's like it's like the mouse that was always chased around by a cat always chased around around and around and around one day he got a he got there there was a party going on he got up on the edge of a glass and he fell down in the wine well the only way he was going to get out of it was drink a you know and after a while he drags himself out and he says how where's that cat amen I tell you when you get the Holy Ghost when you get the power of God in your life the devil won't come looking for you you go looking for the devil and it say it's time it's time for you to flee because we submit our that God we resist the devil and he frees from us hallelujah hallelujah people that got a hold of the power and the devil don't know what to do with them they are stimulated by the Revelation you have a people that start believing they can defeat cancer they can defeat homosexual Spirits they can defeat adultery our kids don't have to live in fornication they don't have to live in sin and darkness amen because we got the power that can defeat any devil any sin amen and bringing obedience to the foot of the cross they got full of new wine these bunch of scared men and women hiding up in the upper room are you with me scared of the Jews Jesus done been crucified up there arguing over who should be the next leader and the next Apostle and who can we sit here and there and all the other formalities and I don't know how you got 120 Jews in one mind in one Accord but 120 people got in one mind in one Accord they wasn't voting on the bishop now they wasn't voting on the next Apostle now they was it wasn't Church politics now it wasn't worried about who's giv the most money in the plate come on now what it was what what was it they got in one mind and one Accord oh yeah if they'd have been here maybe some of them would have been Dem marats some of them would have been publicans big siners they might have been in this political field or that some Pharisees and some Sadducees you know some were pretty fair they believed in the resurrection some didn't they were Sadducees you'll get that tomorrow some of you buns but nevertheless here they're gathered together how you get one a a bunch of Jews in one mind and one Accord I don't know on who who's got the most money in their pocket you know well they always let this one say the most because he he pays them the biggest in the plate but they got 120 in one mind in one Accord you know what it was God we want your fulfillment of your word we want your word fulfilled you said in the last days you would pour out your spirit pour it out Lord we want that spirit and 120 of them got drunk on the Holy Ghost and come staggering out of the upper room speaking in other languages every one of them praising God Amen the Bible said be not drunk on strong drink which is excess but be drunk on the spirit be filled with the spirit God the spirit of God makes you so drunk you forget your enemies and you begin to Everybody's In Love With You amen you don't care who about who's standing around you you you know you're the biggest man in the country right then I I don't care listen brother Brandon would say it this way I don't care if your neighbor sitting next to you went to some dignified church just let the Holy Ghost get on you one time see what takes place get right get real good sa drunk and you'll see what takes place amen I don't know but I guess that's pretty em emed or imbibed or whatever they call it I ain't never been drunk like that thank God I was you know God kept me from those kind of things but maybe you have but nevertheless when God comes amen you get on you get on an intoxication you never get off of Amen you get a filled with the spirit drunk on new wine amen you you say S I got it you want it too yes sir something to take place you know the mother of Jesus was in that upper room too yeah we have some of these lying backsliding preachers today that want to take the power of the new birth away and say well now we just receive the Holy Ghost like Mary did you know without sensation without any feeling without nothing you know that that live was promoted by backslid preacher who now denies the message Mary didn't get a sensation when she was conceived and pregnancy of course but when but but I tell you what there in the upper room she got drunk too just like the others did amen that got got on something they call must be some kind of new wine I wonder if your religion has ever brought you to that place where you forget amen where you forget who you are and who's who and what's what and all the other thing and Jesus becomes the main thing in your life come on and you're in love with your enemies and you hate sin and you love God Amen so drunk on the spirit Hallelujah for you just believe anything God says oh Hallelujah I think I hope we can pass a new wine out this morning the Holy Ghost amen you forget how bad cancer is and remember how good God is you forget about how how evil sins are and what they can do to you and remember there's a God who forgives all iniquities amen now if God brother Brandon said this he said let me tell you right now Virgin Mary and all of them was was among them and if God wouldn't respect the holy Virgin Mary to get in heaven any other ways besides rece the Holy Ghost woman what about you that's right you'll have to pay the same price get the same experience had the same thing that they had back there at the beginning yes sir they got all so drunk a new wine listen some of your sister do you know that the Blessed Virgin Mary was in that now she had to go up there the mother of Jesus had to go up there and be included in that bunch of people so drunk on the spirit till she staggered like she was drunk on whiskey or something and you think you're going to get to Heaven by slipping over to the church putting your song book under your arm and walking every Sunday morning and the bell's to and sit and listen to some of the and walk back you'll never do it you'll have to come that same route because that's the only route God ever laid down and ever has you'll walk it or you won't be there I'm not your judge but I'm preaching the gospel that's exactly the truth the Blessed Virgin was right there acted just as idiotic as the rest of them did just as drunk as the rest of them these men and women every one of them was full of new wine if God ever changed that program put your finger on the scripture for me it isn't there no sir it was plumbed to the end of the age that way plumbed right to the end of the Bible and it will be the same thing until Jesus comes hallelujah hallelujah I believe we can have a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit right now this morning his promises are just real today amen the Bible said God Reign bread out of Heaven well Acts 2 said he reigned the Holy Ghost which is a Heavenly manner out of heaven and of course when it rained down Moses instructed Aaron said now listen what I want you boys to do I want you to go out there and I want you to get some HR full of this mana and you know and and I want you to take it into the holiest of holies and because there under the sh kind of Glory it won't deteriorate if it's kept in the Holy place so what's it far that all down to your generation that every priest that's ordained to be a priest that comes into the holy place that you can go in there with these rers and pick up some of that original mana and come out and lay it on his tongue let him have a taste because he's a priest and now has come behind the veil and he will have a taste to the original Mana at the beginning isn't that amazing God SED out that every generation could have the same taste of the same holy ghost that was out on the day of Pentecost amen and he said what's what's that got to do with Pentecost oh when they were all eating good with that good manner and screaming and shouting and carrying on like that like a bunch of drunk people watch somebody said what can we do and Peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost father promises to you to you to you to you to you to you to them that are far off no matter how far you stay amen as many as the Lord Our God shall call and every man that meets God's condition becomes a priest is to come behind the veil separate himself from the world receive not just a mouthful but a heartful of the original Mana that fell on the day of Pentecost not something that looks like it but the real thing amen how long's it going to last until Jesus comes the Mana lasted until they hit the other land and got some of the old corn amen notice it's a perfect type of our feeding today that Mana has never ceased well we don't let it happen in our church it's never ceased well our denomination don't have it it never ceases well in our church we don't believe that it never ceases God is going to have somebody some real spiritual Israelites come on where the Mana will fall oh God I say let it fall today in this service let the Holy Ghost get poured out like it happened in the upper room we're not in the upper room but I tell you we're here in the last St at the top of the pyramid we're right here before the coming of the Lord and we can still eat of the original Mana the original Holy Ghost yes they went out there screaming and acting like drunk men dancing staggering screaming and slobbering and everything else and they thought they were drunk I said they thought they were drunk when's your church you know people actually thought you were drunk amen they thought they were drunk hello and they said must be some kind of new wine cuz we ain't never seen anybody drunk quite like this must be some kind of new wine and they were actually mocking calling new wine and he says you know these men are not drunk like you're supposing see and this is the third hour of the day but this is that which the prophet Joel spoke of uh you know in the last days hallelujah the last 2,000 years I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and my sons and daughters shall prophesy they will speak with new tongues amen oh no I know we're grown up today we don't believe that some of you some people have never heard speaking in tongue some of have never experienced it you can have it you let some backsliding preacher keep you from it amen but you can have it you can have it just exactly like they had on the day of Pentecost the original Mana is still falling that's right come on somebody amen well brother Tim I'm afraid I'll just get it on my spirit well I'll tell you what if you don't get it on your spirit first it'll never get in your soul so you might as well go ahead and get it on your spirit so it can get saturated right down your soul well brother Tim I know some of them young people they just got you know with the spirit of God and and there they were acting like drunk people then they went back and said yeah they just got it on the spirit get a little deeper boys let it come on a little deeper let it come down in the soul down on the inside of the inside amen and your'll never walk darkness and sin again it'll put a new desire in your heart you have a longing for Jesus how long was

Christmas because you won't see them till Christmas time you know every a little celebration deal then they come you're not to be Baptist Methodist preeran denominational Believers come on you need enough God in you that brings you to the house of God you get God in your life you want to come to the house of God you won't want to miss a service because when you do you miss Jesus because you know he's going to be in church Jesus will never miss a service M don't try to get enough religion one day you know to last you till next year at we skep over got wiggle Tails we ain't seen you for a while well I tell you need some fresh Mana but get enough of it this time down in there that you get a real good taste for it it till you want to come back again and again and again amen that's what's the matter with a lot of our churches today you got wiggle Tails trying to go on an experience you had years ago that's why I believe in a fresh and up toate experience that's why I believe in having communion with Christ and that it's not you know just a wafering and wine that we take that's a symbol symbology of of what we're supposed to be doing daily taken in the spirit of God a fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost amen I know there's many of you that are sitting right here cold in your spirit you need a fresh anointing you need a freshness of the Holy Spirit remember the Mana never ceased from the day from that day till they entered the promised land and the holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost will never cease falling on the church till the Millennium comes Jesus comes in power the old corn again oh wow well brother Tim I tell you what you know we we're we're here in the word today we're here in the in the word today the Mana will never quit falling the same Holy Ghost said fell on the day of Pentecost will never cease falling on the church till the millennial comes well I don't know about you but last time I checked we're not in the Millennium I know there's been some cooks that have preached were already in the Millennium they're idiots sorry just good Southern language they're idiots if this a millennium I'm disappointed in it amen this is no millennium no no no yeah we do we do when we receive the Holy Ghost we do enter into our Sabbath rest but friends we're right here in in the in this horrible age of Leo deia there's no Millennium yet and we need in this time a fresh anointing of the Holy Spirit we ought to expect it every service actually we can have it every day amen we're not just Christians on Sunday and Wednesday we're Christians every day of the week amen and should expect a new anointing a fresh anointing the windows of Heaven just to open up amen and let him pour down but you know today we've changed it we just want it too classy we just shake hands join the church say I believe the message you know might as well be sprinkled or baptized or something they're afraid of the the new birth brother Brandon told it about his own church he said I'm afraid brandham Tabernacle is afraid of the new birth he said you know we know what a birth is said I don't care what it is or where whereabouts it's a mess if a baby's born on a Chuck pile or on a hard floor a pink decorated hospital room it's a mess anyway a Caff a a birth of a c for birth of anything is a mess and a new birth is nothing less than a mess but people get so stue we'll go over where they shake hands we'll go over where they don't ball and cry and beat on the Altar and cry out he said you want to be too human I'll tell you being too human is what got you in the trouble you're in amen God wants a new birth on the inside where you're born not another human but a son and daughter of God filled with the spirit why he said don't be drunk on wine which is excess but be filled with the spirit so he equates being filled with the spirit as drunk on wine Hallelujah you live a different life it'll make you forget all listen brother brandom said it's the perfect intoxication for anyone who's got the blues Hallelujah just get drunk on the Holy Ghost it'll take all them worries away amen you know you can take an old seed potato you know you you put it out in the ground but that old potato's got to rot before it can give life a mean you take corn you can put this beautiful grain of corn down but it's got to rot and Decay for life to come out of it come on a corn can't produce a new life until it rots away amen and you can't produce a new birth until your intellectual and your own dead self is rotten and dead and you dial out on the Altar and scream and get all messed up to a place as the starch gets out of your collar amen and you're born again by the spirit listen to your Prophet I don't care if you Squall speak when tongues jump up and down flop like a chicken with his head off you're bringing forth new life but we substituted something for it something classical a classy way that's why brother Brandon priest a new birth is a mess mhm it'll mess up you're drinking it'll mess up your hobbies it it'll mess up your social life amen it'll even mess up your your dating come on it it'll mess up it'll mess up everything of sin come on Amen but it'll make a new new creature out of you it'll give you a love for the things of God and the things that you used to love you'll hate and the things you used to hate you'll love you pass from death into life now you know here they crossed over Jordan which means separation from this Earthly Journey the Mana which was a spiritual thing ceased and they ate the old corn they ate the fruit of the land again and in the Millennium see we're eating spiritual Mana now but we won't need spiritual Mana in that time we'll eat the fruit of the vine again and the field of the Field of Corn the Bible said we'll build houses and we'll inhabit it we'll plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them when we come to the Millennium that thousand years of rest when there be Wars and troubles and sickness and death will'll flee from the world we'll return on this Earth and be with Christ a thousand years right here before we go go to glory amen so you see there again you know where there again we we we're looking for the time when the Mana will cease when is it going to cease when will God quit pouring out his Spirit it'll be in the millennial Reign amen amen there right now is the day of salvation right now is the time he's pouring out his Spirit right now right now he is taking and making new creatures out of us to live in that place amen now so you see there there they that Mana will never cease to fall until the Millennium the same Mana fell constantly every day of course except Saturday and the the seventh day every day the same until they went to the Millennium the type over into the promised land and that's where all the Hebrew prophets through the years have looked toward for the Millennium and the same Holy Ghost which is a type that that fell on the day of Pentecost will continue the same until the Millennium set in men will still have the Holy Ghost and the same things will take place all the way through that's right until the Millennium age well as far as I know and last time I checked this is sure not the Millennium so the Holy Ghost is still falling hallah and until the last member is brought in the body are you with me the Holy Ghost is going to fall amen may it fall today amen may it come like an upper room experience we don't need them brother Tim oh well I'm worse than you think amen you need the same experience that they had her you won't be there that's right only those that are born again of Jes Jesus will be there with Jesus amen when they entered that land the the Mana ceased to fall a beautiful type is the holy spirit Fallen today which is a Mana from Heaven the day we enter the Millennium Christ the son of David will sit on David's Throne amen won't need any Holy Spirit there because Christ will be there himself in a body form as King Jesus then all the nation is going to beat their plowshares and are there pruning and and and to pruning Hooks and swords into the plow shares and the war is over then going to have some rest around here the whole world's going to rejoice and the Jubilee will come hallelujah what a day we're looking forward amen we're looking for a time friend where where that we we will come into that Millennial rain but friends sad to say this is not the Millennium sad to say this is not the Millennium yet we are still on the journey and for the journey we have to have Mana we've got to have the spirit falling we've got to have the Holy Ghost we got to have the Wafers that taste like Honey Hallelujah we got to have the spirit without measure poured out amen everybody in the New Testament then becomes a new testament priest Born Again of the spirit you become a priest to God and you you give the sacrifice of your lips giving praise to his name you say well I don't feel like it you do it

drunk they forget their problem they forget how big the devil is and realize how big God is they forget about sickness and realize we got a Healer in our mess they forget about their their poverty and
