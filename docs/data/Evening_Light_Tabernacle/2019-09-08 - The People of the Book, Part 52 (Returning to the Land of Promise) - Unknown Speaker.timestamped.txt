[43:59] [Applause]
[44:10] [Music]
[44:15] they talk for that change a man will you
[44:19] turn with me to the Leviticus chapter 26
[44:21] we're gonna read from the first verse
[44:23] this morning right down to about mo
[44:27] verse 11 or 12 so we just thirteen
[44:30] actually is where we'll go to but I want
[44:33] to read from Leviticus for our opening
[44:36] scripture today is we just prepare our
[44:39] hearts to for the Lord to speak to us at
[44:43] the conclusion of my message today and
[44:45] I'm not going to speak long because I
[44:48] want to give time for this this is
[44:50] something we've been waiting for a long
[44:51] long time and we have been waiting for
[44:55] the testimony to be completed that we
[44:58] have recorded of sister Alana butts who
[45:01] is healed of Hodgkin's lymphoma and and
[45:06] we we have made a making a DVD of that
[45:11] of course and putting it on a living God
[45:14] come just to testify what God has done
[45:17] amen because we know he is the same
[45:19] yesterday today and forever amen he's
[45:23] still God he still meets the needs of
[45:26] his people don't matter where we are
[45:28] what the situation is I have in my hands
[45:31] today to prayer cloths one is going to
[45:34] go to over into India and another is
[45:37] going to go into Nigeria where requests
[45:40] have come in for desperate needs or that
[45:43] they needed touch from God and I'm
[45:45] believing for for Daniel and also for so
[45:50] long that is in India Daniel in Nigeria
[45:53] and and Shalom that is in India and we
[45:58] believe that God will bring a healing to
[46:00] them this is according to Acts chapter
[46:01] 19 that they took aprons of cloths from
[46:05] the body of Paul and we're not Paul but
[46:08] he's the same Lord Jesus laid him on the
[46:11] sick and the devils fled from them and
[46:13] they were healed amen so we're looking
[46:16] today to the Word of God and for the
[46:18] promise of his word a man to just be
[46:21] manifest among us Leviticus 26 verse 1
[46:24] you shall make you no idols nor graven
[46:28] image
[46:29] neither rare up a standing image neither
[46:33] shall you set up an any image of stone
[46:35] in your land to bow down to it for I am
[46:39] the Lord your God you shall keep my
[46:43] Sabbath's and reverence my sanctuary I
[46:46] am the Lord that's what to hear today
[46:49] for us to reverence his sanctuary this
[46:53] is a commandment of God you shall keep
[46:55] my Sabbath's and know that we don't
[46:57] worship on Saturday we we worship on
[47:00] Sunday because of the resurrection for
[47:03] we are declaring that he rose from the
[47:06] dead on the first day of the week but we
[47:08] are here to keep to keep and make holy
[47:12] this day in remembrance of him and to
[47:15] reverence his sanctuary and I don't I
[47:19] can't think you know how could we show
[47:21] dis reverence by not being assembling
[47:24] together with the rest of the believers
[47:25] worshiping God I think that's really a
[47:28] part of reverence if you walk in my
[47:31] statues and keep my Commandments and do
[47:33] them then I will give you rain and Dew
[47:36] season and the land shall yield her
[47:39] increased and the trees of the field
[47:41] shall yield their fruit and your

[47:48] sowing time and you shall eat your bread
[47:51] to the full and dwell in your land
[47:54] safely and I will give peace and the
[47:58] land and you shall lie down and none
[48:01] shall make you afraid and I will read
[48:04] the evil beast out of the land and
[48:06] neither shall the sword go through your
[48:09] land and ye shall chase your enemies and
[48:13] they shall fall before you by the sword
[48:15] and five of you shall chase on hundred
[48:19] and a hundred of you shall put ten
[48:21] thousand to flight amen and your enemies
[48:25] shall fall before you by the sword for I
[48:28] will have respect unto you and will make
[48:32] you fruitful and multiply you and
[48:34] establish my covenant with you and you
[48:37] shall eat old story and bring forth the
[48:40] old because
[48:41] the new and I was setting my Tabernacle
[48:44] among you and my soul shall not abhor
[48:46] you and I will walk among you and I will
[48:48] be your God and you shall be my people I
[48:50] am the Lord your God which brought you
[48:54] forth out of the land of Egypt that you

[49:00] have broken the bands of your yoke and
[49:03] made you go upright amen let's bow our
[49:07] heads just for a moment father
[49:09] I'll hold in my hands today these two
[49:11] prayer cloths that will be going to
[49:14] little hearts little believers Lord that
[49:17] are desperately in need of touching from
[49:19] you and today Lord as we send forth
[49:22] Oh God on the wings of this prayer we

[49:28] because you said in my name they will
[49:30] cast out Devils amen and we believe that
[49:33] word Lord we know that no enemy that can
[49:36] that's can stand before us and no weapon
[49:40] shall prosper Lord oh god this is this
[49:44] is the inheritance of the saints none
[49:47] that is formed against us shall prosper
[49:49] and the enemy will have to flee before
[49:52] us because you are mighty Lord and your
[49:55] word is true I pray God that you'll
[49:58] bring healing and deliverance to your
[50:00] children today around the world wherever
[50:02] they are and whatever needed to have is
[50:04] they hear this message today may lord
[50:07] their hearts just be turned into joy
[50:08] knowing that there's a mighty God on
[50:11] their side today in Jesus name Amen amen
[50:15] god bless you you can be seated man good
[50:20] to be in the house of the Lord once more
[50:22] you know I as I was contemplating this
[50:26] service today and as I've been traveling
[50:30] for the last several weeks and and
[50:34] coming back to home and of course the
[50:36] many catch-up things that you have to do
[50:38] coming back home it was with the with
[50:41] the Baxter family in their time of need
[50:43] and different situations that arose but
[50:48] I was i yesterday as I
[50:51] I'm looking at perhaps something else -
[50:53] Minister bong I was sent the same video
[50:56] clip of from three different people that
[51:00] wouldn't would send it actually all of
[51:02] these came to me personally from either
[51:05] South Africa or Africa and they were
[51:07] showing up 240 Jewish people making
[51:12] their Aliyah and they were returning to
[51:15] their homeland the Land of Israel and
[51:19] one of these Jews who were interviewed
[51:21] said it's about the Bible coming to life
[51:24] about the in gathering bringing the
[51:27] Jewish people home and when we're all
[51:29] together in our homeland that brings the
[51:31] most light to the whole world and of
[51:34] course you know I believe that we are a
[51:37] spiritual counterpart that as the Bible
[51:40] would speak of Israel as a nation that
[51:43] God he speaks of his the the election
[51:47] tiles as a people that is called out for
[51:51] his namesake and so therefore you know
[51:54] as we look into the promises of God some
[51:57] of it may apply to Israel physically but
[52:00] it all applies to us in the spiritual
[52:02] manner it is ours to believe and receive
[52:05] and this will return to their homeland
[52:08] is nothing short of miraculous
[52:11] we do have returned to homeland and that
[52:14] is a homeland of of the Bible hey man
[52:18] you know when I think of the homeland of
[52:21] the Bible that is a place where miracles
[52:23] happen where great things happen for
[52:26] God's people where salvation takes place
[52:29] and deliverance happens when when you
[52:33] are in your homeland of the Word of God
[52:37] and of the Holy Ghost and I believe that
[52:40] you know as we are think about it today
[52:42] I can hardly think of even this place
[52:47] without thinking of how this church was
[52:50] built on the miraculous you know and
[52:53] because it's built on the miraculous uh
[52:55] you know we we can expect God to do
[52:59] extreme things
[53:01] because God has done some extreme things
[53:05] in this generation to get our hearts to
[53:07] believe in you see it is promised
[53:11] according to Malachi 4 that he said
[53:13] Behold our sins you Elijah the Prophet
[53:15] before the coming of the Great and
[53:17] dreadful day of the Lord and he said
[53:19] turn your hearts back to the faith of
[53:22] the fathers and I believe we're in that
[53:24] hour of a great restoration and a
[53:27] renewing of the Holy Ghost you and this
[53:30] building around the world wherever
[53:32] you're hearing this message today I want
[53:35] you to know this message is one of
[53:37] deliverance it is a message that will
[53:40] bring freedom from slavery of sin it is
[53:43] a message that will give light in the
[53:45] time of your darkness that there is
[53:48] nothing that is too hard for our Lord a
[53:51] man and as I said that you know we we
[53:54] are here in the last age of the Gentile
[53:57] dispensation in the seventh and last the
[54:00] Laodicean Church age when God is showing
[54:03] his great power raising our faith he has
[54:07] to do that to prepare us for the great
[54:09] rapture we believe here that the rapture
[54:13] is not just something we talk about or
[54:15] just a funeral scripture that is given
[54:17] for comfort but we believe that it is
[54:19] real and then it is alive and there is
[54:23] something that will take place in our
[54:25] generation you say well brother Tim they
[54:28] have looked for this for 2,000 years but
[54:31] yeah we are traverse now seven church
[54:33] ages beginning from Ephesus down the
[54:36] Laodicea and we are now here in the end
[54:39] time and all the signs showed the end
[54:42] time never has there been a time that
[54:45] the world could burn with fire with just
[54:47] with just a few pushes of the button yet
[54:50] the Bible prophesied that it would
[54:52] happen never has there been a time like
[54:55] it has been again the repeat of the days
[54:58] of Noah and the days of Sodom which work
[55:01] both hours of destruction and I'll tell
[55:04] you we are in a time of where that there
[55:06] will be great destruction come upon the
[55:08] earth but
[55:09] for that time God's going to rapture out
[55:12] of people and I'll tell you that is the
[55:14] promise that we'll look for we cannot
[55:16] put our I hope into anything else man we
[55:20] appreciate good men that will stand for
[55:23] righteousness but I'll tell you all the
[55:25] men you can line up we'll never turn the
[55:27] nation back to God and then because it
[55:31] is prophesied of this end time that it's
[55:33] all coming down to the end but there it
[55:37] is not the end for you it's only the end
[55:39] for the devil it's only the end for his
[55:42] kingdom it's only the end for his
[55:44] children but it's not the end for you
[55:46] it'll suddenly beginning for every child
[55:49] of God we can look forward to that
[55:54] promise but while we're here we still
[55:57] need the miraculous working power of God
[56:00] and as I said this church was built on
[56:03] miracles you know I was established as I
[56:07] had thought back and I had to go look up
[56:10] the paperwork to see but we six years
[56:14] ago we bought this property here and we
[56:17] just and it was there that we would
[56:19] decide to build a church and would move
[56:22] from Cleveland parish over here and of
[56:25] course many of our folks is not from
[56:27] Claiborne parish there they're from
[56:29] Webster they're from Boger they're from
[56:31] Caddo they're from Louisiana Mississippi
[56:34] and Arkansas and you know many other
[56:38] places that will gather in here today
[56:40] and and be in the service with us many
[56:44] are connected across the world that some
[56:47] of some settings that won't wouldn't be
[56:50] able to attend church but they're able
[56:52] to be in service with us today amen but
[56:55] it was about it was about seven years
[56:58] ago now that brother Gary stanky here
[57:01] right - raise your hand brother Gary and
[57:03] I want you to stand up god bless you
[57:05] it's so good to have you again
[57:11] these folks come down from Manny
[57:13] Louisiana Drive in two hours to be in
[57:16] service and he said to me one day
[57:18] brother Jim he said a church alive is
[57:20] worth the drive a man aren't you glad to
[57:24] serve a living God is because he's among
[57:27] us is why we have life but brother Gary
[57:30] stank he was hospitalized because of a
[57:33] blockage in his colon the good the
[57:36] doctors did surgeries to remove it but
[57:38] he went a total of three weeks without
[57:40] food and he was in a dying condition as
[57:43] the stomach would not digest food and he
[57:46] had a an experience while he was in a
[57:49] hospital just seemed like you know he
[57:51] reached a very low in weak point and in
[57:54] that moment every kind of demon started
[57:57] coming into his room he had this
[57:58] horrible not another sleep nightmare but
[58:02] a nightmare where he wasn't asleep and
[58:04] all these Devils were howling at him and
[58:07] threatening to take his life and to be
[58:10] quite honest with you when I heard of
[58:11] that I I thought you know brother Gary's
[58:14] a man passed 70 and if God wants to take
[58:17] him a man that's a great deliverance we
[58:20] believe in life after death man we
[58:23] believe in an instant health once we
[58:26] cross this veil of sorrow amen we
[58:30] believe that he would move right into a
[58:32] new theophany body man and add but
[58:36] however I'm we're not wasn't afraid of
[58:38] him dying but we just didn't want the
[58:40] devil to torment him it is right a man
[58:44] for a child of God to be haunted and
[58:47] tormented by the devil I'm just telling
[58:50] you today it isn't right it isn't right
[58:53] if you're tormented if you're afflicted
[58:55] it isn't right
[58:57] quint jesus paid it off
[59:00] hallelujah what we're thinking like
[59:02] Jesus I just read the the the sign up
[59:05] here let this mind be in you which was
[59:07] also in Christ Jesus and Jesus didn't
[59:10] think it right command of the sick that
[59:13] they would not be healed the blind that
[59:16] their eyes would not come open or the
[59:18] crippled will not walk you said I won't
[59:20] happen in this day you can come too late
[59:23] to tell me I've done seen a Living God
[59:26] I'd see them in the power of his
[59:28] resurrection if I've seen him heal the
[59:31] sick batsy to take the loss and save
[59:34] them that takes her life that makes a
[59:37] new creation in Christ hallelujah why
[59:42] just yesterday one of our evangelists
[59:44] brother Darrell Ward came back from
[59:46] Poland and they sent him a report said
[59:49] as you walked off the platform brother
[59:51] Darrell a man was standing there with
[59:53] crippled and he said he had he had died
[59:56] his canes there that he had to walk with
[59:58] and you stopped and prayed for him I
[1:00:00] want you to know that today he don't
[1:00:03] walk with canes anymore he walks
[1:00:05] normally and healed God just working in
[1:00:12] one person is God working in a body
[1:00:14] ministry around the world a man but he
[1:00:19] had that brother Gary had this
[1:00:20] experience where demons coming in his
[1:00:23] room and it made me angry I'm beyond the
[1:00:26] sweetie it just made me mad you know
[1:00:29] sometimes you just got to get angry with
[1:00:30] the devil man how many has ever been so
[1:00:35] sick and tired of being sick and tired
[1:00:36] that you're sick and tired of being sick
[1:00:38] and tired maybe you're that way in this
[1:00:42] moment maybe there's a habit in your
[1:00:44] life a situation that is there a problem
[1:00:47] in your life but you've got to get the
[1:00:48] point where you're sick and tired of
[1:00:50] being sick and tired of being sick and
[1:00:52] tired of being sick and tired you got to
[1:00:56] become you gotta come to the place you
[1:00:58] no longer want to be in bondage anymore
[1:01:02] hallelujah but in a way I got angry and
[1:01:07] I'll tell you I walked into that that
[1:01:10] hospital room that day with my wife and
[1:01:12] you know the story I texted brother
[1:01:14] Timothy and I said pray with me before I
[1:01:17] go as I go in and he said dad remember
[1:01:20] we're right in the book of Acts in not
[1:01:24] what the churches to do in that the last
[1:01:27] commission that Jesus gave the church
[1:01:29] marked 16 these signs shall follow them
[1:01:32] that believe in my name they will cast
[1:01:34] out Devils in my name they will speak
[1:01:37] with new tongues in my name if they
[1:01:39] drink any deadly thing it won't hurt
[1:01:41] them
[1:01:42] come on and they'll take up serpents and
[1:01:44] they will not harm them and he says his
[1:01:47] disciples I give you power to tread on
[1:01:49] scorpions and upon serpents and nothing
[1:01:52] by any means shall harm you I'll tell
[1:01:55] you there's so many precious promises
[1:01:57] that lies in this land that's what I'm
[1:02:01] preaching on today is a return returning
[1:02:05] to the land of promise but the Gary's
[1:02:07] voice was so low you can imagine he had
[1:02:09] natan 21 days
[1:02:11] the doctors would later tell him you
[1:02:14] were dying and I drew up a chair beside
[1:02:19] his bed and he began to share his heart
[1:02:21] about having a place for people to come
[1:02:24] and where they can stay even overnight
[1:02:26] and one of his great concerns was the
[1:02:29] young people and others not having a
[1:02:31] place to stay where they could go to
[1:02:33] youth meetings he said I'd be willing to
[1:02:35] help any way I could if we could just do
[1:02:38] something and I'll tell you whatever he
[1:02:41] said please the Lord because I knew when
[1:02:44] it happened the Holy Spirit dropped
[1:02:46] right down in that room that day
[1:02:48] it gave me that gave me gave me the
[1:02:52] words to curse that devil by that
[1:02:54] evening he was I think it was that
[1:02:56] evening not there early next morning he
[1:02:58] started eating a little bit of jell-o
[1:03:00] and a little bit of this natin
[1:03:02] immediately he started on the road to
[1:03:04] men and did the process of healing he's
[1:03:07] returned back to health again
[1:03:08] [Applause]
[1:03:14] because of this I knew I had a mandate
[1:03:17] from God to do something we were
[1:03:19] landlocked and we were as I purchased
[1:03:22] this property for the church and and the
[1:03:24] decision was made for a new building and
[1:03:27] we saw a miracle after miracle after
[1:03:29] miracle to follow until we're right here
[1:03:31] today a man with a building that has
[1:03:35] completely paid for and since then we've
[1:03:38] been building our youth activities
[1:03:40] building and we'll own no debt on when
[1:03:43] we complete it and we hope that'll be
[1:03:45] soon
[1:03:46] amen that is completed but we have
[1:03:49] learned together through all of these
[1:03:51] times the power of unity and believers
[1:03:54] agreeing together when you see this
[1:03:58] video today that we're going to be
[1:04:00] showing in a few minutes and I'm
[1:04:01] conscious of time I know because it's
[1:04:05] it's a the testimony is has some a
[1:04:08] little bit of link to it but it's worth
[1:04:10] every minute of it you've got to see it
[1:04:12] but we've learned the power of unity and
[1:04:14] believers agree and together and and and
[1:04:17] this is a result of a believing Church
[1:04:20] standing together on the end the breach
[1:04:23] for the need of another jesus said in
[1:04:27] Matthew 18:18 verily I say to you
[1:04:30] whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall
[1:04:32] be bound in heaven and whatever you
[1:04:35] loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
[1:04:37] and again I say to you that if any two
[1:04:41] of you shall agree on earth and touching
[1:04:44] anything that they shall ask and it
[1:04:46] shall be done of them of my father which
[1:04:49] is in heaven amen God has done so many
[1:04:54] great things in our age to enable us to
[1:04:57] believe he's done it not just to show
[1:05:01] off but to to enlarge our faith to
[1:05:04] believe for the impossible
[1:05:06] why would start 1946 with an angel of
[1:05:10] God coming to a man by the name of
[1:05:13] William Branham and that was spirit that
[1:05:16] was causing a divine healing movement
[1:05:18] and
[1:05:18] him would come would come men like all
[1:05:23] Robertson and others that would go out
[1:05:26] and preach that God is a healer and God
[1:05:30] is a deliverer and God has taught us to
[1:05:34] believe in the impossible in fact Jesus
[1:05:37] words in mark 11:23 he says for verily I
[1:05:41] say unto you that whosoever are you one
[1:05:45] of them that whosoever shall say unto
[1:05:48] this mountain be thou removed and be
[1:05:51] thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt
[1:05:54] in his heart but believe that those
[1:05:56] states which he saith shall come to pass
[1:05:58] he shall have whatsoever he saith can
[1:06:03] you imagine that God that gave you that
[1:06:06] power as a believing Christian a man to
[1:06:09] proclaim his words and take his words
[1:06:11] and put in your mouth against the enemy
[1:06:15] and that would that we can have
[1:06:18] whatsoever we say that's what it is in
[1:06:22] that what Jesus said my Matthew 17:20
[1:06:26] said for verily I say to you if you have
[1:06:28] faith as a grain of mustard seed you
[1:06:31] shall say unto this mountain remove
[1:06:33] hence to yonder place and it shall
[1:06:36] remove and nothing somebody say nothing
[1:06:39] nothing shall be impossible to you
[1:06:42] notice this it didn't even say nothing
[1:06:44] is impossible that God said if I can get
[1:06:48] you to believe if you will start
[1:06:51] believing and confessing and standing on
[1:06:53] the Word of God if you take me at my
[1:06:55] word nothing will be impossible to you
[1:07:00] what a promise that he is now God wants
[1:07:05] us to know that He loves us and then all
[1:07:09] the time he just drops his little love
[1:07:11] gifts along the way a man you know I
[1:07:16] realize the Bible said God so loved the
[1:07:19] world and that's often that's awesome
[1:07:22] that is awesome that is an awesome
[1:07:25] thought the world
[1:07:26] but when I'm throwing I look at it I
[1:07:29] have to bring that personal to me God to
[1:07:31] love me you know the word really doesn't
[1:07:37] mean anything unless it becomes personal
[1:07:40] God so love me and I am of course I
[1:07:45] believe that's why that he has brought
[1:07:47] us back to the land of promise in order
[1:07:51] to show his love to us he wants you to
[1:07:54] know you're his beloved you have been
[1:07:57] chosen in him before the foundation of
[1:07:59] the world you have been selected and
[1:08:02] hand-picked by God you have been called
[1:08:05] in ordained to a purpose what before the
[1:08:08] world began he knew you and he calls you
[1:08:11] and he put your name in the Lamb's Book
[1:08:13] of Life
[1:08:14] hallelujah oh it's down to the altar
[1:08:17] sometimes that we realize who our real
[1:08:19] father is of where we really come from
[1:08:22] but God had this a long time before we
[1:08:25] knew about it he already plans your
[1:08:28] coming he knew exactly what your need
[1:08:30] would be he knew exactly what to provide
[1:08:33] for your salvation and your deliverance
[1:08:36] this God is a God of purpose he's a God
[1:08:40] with a plan and he's got a plan for your
[1:08:44] life today first John 3 and 1 he says
[1:08:48] behold what manner of love have the
[1:08:51] fathers bestowed upon us that we should
[1:08:53] be called the sons of God therefore the
[1:08:56] world knoweth us not because it knew him
[1:08:59] not beloved now we are the sons of God
[1:09:02] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:09:05] be but we know that when we saw he shall
[1:09:09] appear we shall be like him for we shall
[1:09:12] see him as he is another translation
[1:09:17] would say it this way see what great
[1:09:20] love the father has lavished upon us I
[1:09:25] love to think of that God wants to
[1:09:27] lavish upon his children
[1:09:30] I'm a no good thing will he withhold
[1:09:33] from you our man the trousers give an
[1:09:37] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:09:40] all of these Wayne what manner of love
[1:09:43] the great love the father has lavished
[1:09:46] on us that we should be called the
[1:09:49] children of God and that's what we are
[1:09:52] the reason the world don't know us is
[1:09:55] because it didn't know him hey man oh
[1:09:59] yeah when he came they didn't know him
[1:10:02] and man when and he said the world won't
[1:10:06] know you either a man but nevertheless
[1:10:09] he says what manner of love
[1:10:12] I was bestow I lavish on my children you
[1:10:20] know sometimes do we get the thought
[1:10:22] somehow another that God hates us and
[1:10:25] God wants to destroy but God doesn't
[1:10:28] hate any of his own man you know what
[1:10:32] man said to me one time in the counted
[1:10:34] as I sat down and was discussing with
[1:10:36] him my taxes and and he said to me he
[1:10:39] said you know brother Purdy's that I
[1:10:41] just don't believe a loving father would
[1:10:43] send any of his children to hell I said
[1:10:46] neither do i I said there won't be on
[1:10:50] one of his children there hallelujah
[1:10:56] amen all of those that are begotten that
[1:10:59] God will never be in hell hell was not
[1:11:02] even made for you hell was made for the
[1:11:05] devil and his angels it wasn't made for
[1:11:07] the sons of God a man and he said what
[1:11:11] man of love I wouldn't lavish on you or
[1:11:15] if you're a sinner today and you're away
[1:11:17] from God and you don't know him let me
[1:11:19] tell you he wants to lavish love on you
[1:11:22] it's all I'm greedy he'll take gifts
[1:11:25] away in that away listen he he's not
[1:11:27] wanting to take away he's wanting to add
[1:11:29] to you
[1:11:31] man he's wanting to add to you oh yeah
[1:11:35] you know you may take away your smoking
[1:11:38] your drink in your line your cussin and
[1:11:40] you're doping in your adult horizon and
[1:11:42] you're fornicating and your homosexual
[1:11:44] lifestyle and he may take all of that
[1:11:47] away but all you replace it with so much
[1:11:49] more this will be the greatest trade you
[1:11:53] ever made in your life to change to
[1:11:56] trader your sins for his righteousness
[1:12:02] Zechariah said he he for he that touch
[1:12:06] of you touches the apple of his eye
[1:12:08] that's what he thinks about you the
[1:12:11] apple of his eye
[1:12:13] you talk about love God wants us to know
[1:12:15] that He loves us man I'm looking out
[1:12:19] across the audience today and I see
[1:12:21] brother Kenneth the middle didn't hear
[1:12:23] god bless you brother Kenneth he shared
[1:12:26] with me a testimony the other day but I
[1:12:29] just want to just talk about him just
[1:12:31] for a moment you know brother Kenneth is
[1:12:35] he's a he's one of those real Christians
[1:12:39] hey man there's something really real
[1:12:41] about him and but there's been a lot of
[1:12:44] love lavished on him amen
[1:12:48] you know the Bible and I tell you I
[1:12:50] believe he loves much because the Bible
[1:12:52] said if you're forgiven much you love
[1:12:55] much hey man and brother Kenneth is a
[1:12:59] young man he was a Christian but he fell
[1:13:01] away in the sin and straight away from
[1:13:03] God many years later he came back to God
[1:13:06] on his bed crippled unable to walk
[1:13:11] without a walker I walked into his room
[1:13:13] that day of the hospital and I said you
[1:13:16] know Kenneth there's still hope for you
[1:13:18] he said is her brother Jim I said yes
[1:13:20] there's hope
[1:13:21] I said God's a God of mercy he'll bring
[1:13:23] you back to him that day we prayed with
[1:13:27] him and and of course you know he again
[1:13:32] he was a broken man crippled unable to
[1:13:34] walk most the time wheelchair bound but
[1:13:39] because of his terrible sin Layton pass
[1:13:41] he struggled with being forgiven you
[1:13:43] know there's
[1:13:45] I want you to realize forgiveness God is
[1:13:48] God that will forgive and he not only
[1:13:51] forgives but he forgets in the first
[1:14:02] place this is the God is merciful of
[1:14:06] mercy said as far as East is from the
[1:14:09] West I'll remove your sins from you what
[1:14:13] a God and what a savior and but because
[1:14:18] of his terrible sin Lillian Pratt has he
[1:14:20] struggled oh god do you love me and one
[1:14:24] day he was sitting by the phone and free
[1:14:27] and just telling the Lord Lord I love
[1:14:29] you you know that but I just like to
[1:14:31] hear you say I love you
[1:14:33] you know sometimes that's the way it is
[1:14:35] we tell God all the time we love him but
[1:14:38] we just need that assurance we just need
[1:14:42] that little special touch and he sighed
[1:14:45] and got up from with his Walker and
[1:14:47] painfully struggled to the refrigerator
[1:14:49] to reveal his mug with tea or coffee
[1:14:52] whatever he's drinking scooted his mug
[1:14:55] along the kitchen counter praying the
[1:14:57] same prayer over and over Lord I love
[1:14:58] you and you know that but I just like to
[1:15:01] hear you say to me I love you could you
[1:15:07] do it please this once and finally with
[1:15:10] difficulty he puts the mug along the
[1:15:12] counter back to his chair praying as he
[1:15:14] went reaching the chair he sat down and
[1:15:18] say Amen and was about to take a drink
[1:15:22] out of his mug and he said the phone
[1:15:27] rang I happened to be in my barn that
[1:15:30] day am doing morning chores and the
[1:15:32] voice of God spoke to me and said go and
[1:15:34] call Kenneth and tell him these words I
[1:15:36] love you and I quickly ran to the phone
[1:15:41] and I made a call and said Kenneth I
[1:15:43] don't know what all this is about
[1:15:44] but God just spoke to me these words and
[1:15:47] I know it was him and he said to tell
[1:15:49] you these words I love you and he began
[1:15:52] to shout and have a revival
[1:15:54] filled with assurance that God did
[1:15:56] indeed love him hallelujah
[1:16:02] but God's got many ways of letting you
[1:16:05] know he loves you man in my he would go
[1:16:08] to the cross and give up everything and
[1:16:12] but give them all of heaven just to show
[1:16:15] you how God loves you we find that in
[1:16:19] Zechariah 2 it says for this is what
[1:16:23] they Almighty God the Lord Almighty says
[1:16:26] after the glorious one has sent me
[1:16:28] against the nation's that have plundered
[1:16:30] you whoever touches you touches the
[1:16:33] apple of his eye
[1:16:34] what a wonderful scripture that we quote
[1:16:36] again the apple of his eye mom we don't
[1:16:41] have to look at ourselves as the scum of
[1:16:43] the earth and the down-and-out and
[1:16:46] nobody loves me you know we all goes
[1:16:51] through those things sometimes I was
[1:16:54] there with Amanda and Caleb's little
[1:16:57] children and you know some of the
[1:16:59] children was there at the Lakeside and
[1:17:01] they were of fishing and and the
[1:17:04] littlest one back there I wanted to say
[1:17:06] you know I never get to fish and since
[1:17:11] what you know will you let me have a
[1:17:13] turn so what my sister would never do it
[1:17:16] she's she's bigger than me and she never
[1:17:19] gives me anything and you know I you
[1:17:22] know she don't ever treat me right and
[1:17:24] she don't even say she's sorry when she
[1:17:26] does things she was just feeling so down
[1:17:28] and out mate trying to make us feel so
[1:17:31] down and out so we'd give her a fishing
[1:17:33] boat when she got her chance but you
[1:17:36] know that's why did we want to feel
[1:17:38] loved sometimes we want to know God
[1:17:40] loves us that he cares about us that he
[1:17:44] understands our humanity that he's able
[1:17:47] to reach further down than what we can
[1:17:49] even look up
[1:17:50] this is the kind of God that we serve
[1:17:53] aren't you glad to serve Him brother
[1:17:57] Kenneth spoke to me this past week he
[1:17:59] said I can't wait for you to get home
[1:18:01] and he said I was gonna let you get home
[1:18:03] and tell you this but he said since you
[1:18:06] called me on the phone said I got to
[1:18:08] tell you and he said you know four
[1:18:11] months ago the doctor said he said I had
[1:18:14] cancer in the blood Leukemia Lymphoma
[1:18:16] and it spread to one-third of my bones
[1:18:20] and the lymph nodes and my stomach was
[1:18:22] so large he said his stomach had swelled
[1:18:25] out and the doctor said hey that might
[1:18:28] burst and spread to his body any moment
[1:18:30] and doctors told him he had cancer in
[1:18:33] 50% of his body and the doctor put him
[1:18:37] on a little small pill to boost his
[1:18:39] immune system but he he has had no chemo
[1:18:42] or radiation two weeks ago now it's been
[1:18:47] a little over two weeks now
[1:18:48] he went had a doctor's visit when the
[1:18:52] doctor came into the room in the
[1:18:53] examination room he came in smiling and
[1:18:56] he says you know having this test in his
[1:18:59] hands he said I want to let me let me
[1:19:01] shake the hands of an awesome man he
[1:19:04] said wow wow wow wow

[1:19:29] I can't explain how he's gone but he's
[1:19:31] gone said your left nodes are normal now

[1:19:42] Kenneth laid on his deathbed they were
[1:19:44] calling in the family who called her son
[1:19:46] his son Brian all the way from Montana
[1:19:49] because he was at the point of death and
[1:19:52] he's calling the family but I preached
[1:19:55] that morning old that we are the sons of
[1:19:59] God a man and that there there was a
[1:20:03] power that was in the blood that would
[1:20:05] heal and deliver and that we only needed
[1:20:08] just to claim what God gave us in his
[1:20:11] promise
[1:20:12] hey ma'am and so me and the ministry
[1:20:16] team went down that day to the hospital

[1:20:26] prayed for you this morning but we come
[1:20:28] together to lay hands upon you and
[1:20:30] believe together in this hospital room
[1:20:32] that God will do the miraculous you know
[1:20:38] just because the doctor gives you that
[1:20:40] don't mean God gives you it God is the
[1:20:43] one who never lost a patient

[1:20:51] life than we are here are you with me
[1:20:55] Amen but brother Kenneth I I said now I
[1:20:58] said now what I want you to do is I want
[1:21:00] you to ask me in you to say what your
[1:21:03] desire yes because whatever you say

[1:21:31] stents

[1:21:46] your shows me that your heart is now
[1:21:49] operating perfectly
[1:21:50] he said he explained the heart is a
[1:21:53] muscle and that this just does not
[1:21:55] happen it does not reveal itself but
[1:21:58] your heart is restored in I don't know
[1:22:01] what's going on but this just don't
[1:22:03] happen what's going on
[1:22:08] [Applause]
[1:22:18] [Applause]
[1:22:23] [Applause]
[1:22:33] thanks be to God I just want to tell you
[1:22:39] restorations on the beginning I'm
[1:22:41] believing of a complete cold deliverance
[1:22:45] total deliveries in this land of
[1:22:52] promises the land of our father this
[1:22:55] land this land the promise is the land
[1:22:58] of Samson if you can't find it find me I
[1:23:02] meant to do this but find me that that
[1:23:05] that picture of Moriah for a moment here
[1:23:08] and I just I want to just talk about it
[1:23:11] for a minute because we have returned to
[1:23:13] the land of promise in the land of
[1:23:16] promise it was a man by the name of
[1:23:18] Samson he had long hair because of a
[1:23:21] Nazarite vow it was uncut this land of a
[1:23:24] people and I wanted to say this is a
[1:23:27] land of the people who are under a
[1:23:30] Nazarite vow in other words they are
[1:23:33] holy unto the Lord they're set apart for
[1:23:36] a purpose that's what Christians are
[1:23:39] supposed to be a people set apart from
[1:23:42] the world a man identified with him
[1:23:46] their holy unto the Lord and they are to
[1:23:49] show they are different from the world
[1:23:51] in the way they dress and the way they
[1:23:53] live and the way they act
[1:23:55] Samson of course departed from the
[1:23:57] promise of the land because he tempted
[1:24:00] sin and finally was lulled to sleep in
[1:24:04] the lap of Delilah and his hair was cut
[1:24:07] and he lost his power with God
[1:24:11] you know Delilah was and they're the
[1:24:14] Philistines won't know what is the
[1:24:16] secret of your power Samson and I want
[1:24:20] to remind this church what is the secret
[1:24:22] of our power it isn't because we're
[1:24:25] better than somebody else it isn't
[1:24:27] because we're more intelligent or we got
[1:24:30] a room more full people with great
[1:24:33] college education
[1:24:35] standing a world knowledge and her great
[1:24:38] great great man's out of the world
[1:24:40] that's not the source of our power our
[1:24:42] source of our power is our relationship
[1:24:45] with Jesus Christ and I'll tell you what
[1:24:48] that's a that is what a good eye is find
[1:24:52] in the weak jellyfish of a young man or
[1:24:56] young woman that cannot resist the evils
[1:24:59] of the world and the Holy Ghost will put
[1:25:02] us find in them what they think it stand
[1:25:05] for righteousness and stand for truth
[1:25:10] but you know Samson laid his head down
[1:25:15] in the lap of Delilah and she discovered
[1:25:19] his secret and that it was his covenant
[1:25:22] with God which was represented in his
[1:25:25] seven locks that he was separated unto
[1:25:28] God
[1:25:29] there's a Nazarite you know what
[1:25:32] happened Samson was blinded and
[1:25:34] imprisoned made to grind at the wheel to
[1:25:37] grind for the Philistines but one day
[1:25:41] been taken to a festival for the gods of
[1:25:44] the village team to celebrate victory
[1:25:46] over Jehovah he returned he returned his
[1:25:50] promise and he began to think about the
[1:25:54] Lord and he began to reach back and he
[1:25:57] realize dumb Philistines and let his
[1:26:01] hair grow out again a man and his glory
[1:26:05] was returning and with it his power
[1:26:09] now you see the reason I'm preaching
[1:26:13] about this I believe we're in the land
[1:26:15] of Samson we're in the Bible and we're
[1:26:19] Bible promises come to life Amen that
[1:26:23] their proper sign of an endtime people
[1:26:25] or people who who will who will be
[1:26:28] restored back to their power after the
[1:26:31] church that's lead in the lap of Delilah
[1:26:34] for so long and sold their virtues
[1:26:37] and the church has done this they sold
[1:26:39] their virtues with programs
[1:26:41] denominational ideas and I didn't
[1:26:44] thoughts of man and then I think they
[1:26:46] come to the point that they're so
[1:26:48] politically correct about everything
[1:26:50] they lost their virtues but I tell you I
[1:26:54] believe that God is restoring the glory
[1:26:57] to some men and women to the power of
[1:27:02] God who realize I don't have to sell
[1:27:05] myself out to the world
[1:27:07] I can stand for Jesus and just let the
[1:27:09] world go by
[1:27:11] I can here brother Branham say and God
[1:27:17] send us another church just before the
[1:27:20] end time that the power of the Holy
[1:27:22] Ghost can come into her and the
[1:27:24] demonstrations of the Spirit and March
[1:27:26] 16 can follow the church acts 2 and 4
[1:27:30] acts 2:38 and all of it would be
[1:27:33] following right along with the church
[1:27:34] signs and wonders accompanied that
[1:27:37] apostles great signs of his resurrection
[1:27:39] accompanied them while we're in prison
[1:27:42] surely God's growing a crop somewhere
[1:27:44] for the last kill may it be you my
[1:27:47] Christian friend here this morning may
[1:27:49] your strength the may it be your
[1:27:51] strength has begun to grow and I pray
[1:27:53] this message this morning out in the
[1:27:55] land the word this will go I trust this
[1:27:58] message will help bring the vitamin to
[1:28:00] your system that'll grow a spirit of
[1:28:02] power back into your life again
[1:28:06] hallelujah a man here we are
[1:28:09] Mariah Pruett had alopecia the day and
[1:28:15] and this wasn't the worst up and it went
[1:28:18] right on down until her hairs were gone
[1:28:20] from her head she prayed she was prayed
[1:28:25] for huh I'll never remember the service
[1:28:27] we were in the old church in Claiborne
[1:28:29] parish and I was preaching about 1st
[1:28:32] Corinthians 11 and the hair being the
[1:28:35] glory of God for the woman and how that
[1:28:38] she's a Nazarite unto the Lord and as I
[1:28:40] preached those scriptures and then spoke
[1:28:43] of those things I look back out there
[1:28:46] and I saw a girl
[1:28:48] with a just a handkerchief on her head
[1:28:50] that the devil had robbed her of her
[1:28:53] glory shame that embarrassed and all of
[1:28:58] this a young girl but that day we call
[1:29:02] her down to the altar there and I said
[1:29:04] you know God put this in the Bible that
[1:29:08] women were to have long hair and it was
[1:29:11] her glory and the devil has wrapped this
[1:29:13] from this daughter of God
[1:29:15] but we're here to cast Satan out we
[1:29:19] gathered around and prayed for her that
[1:29:21] day and faith began to work within her
[1:29:24] heart and then if I can I will I do
[1:29:28] believe that jesus heals me now come on
[1:29:33] hey man and they came over and Easter
[1:29:36] just some months later on this little
[1:29:38] bald-headed Mariah with a holding three
[1:29:41] little hair pins in her hands walks
[1:29:44] there in the prayer line and says some
[1:29:46] other Timothy I want to wear these what
[1:29:53] was he doing
[1:29:54] she was staking her claim in the land of
[1:29:57] promise a man she was takin her claim in
[1:30:02] the land of promise somebody with me

[1:30:11] right they see us right in front of me

[1:30:17] the glory
[1:30:22] a member consistent for clay vandal and
[1:30:26] the promise is somebody with me now
[1:30:30] I'm telling you friends I look more than
[1:30:33] just for a little girl to her glory
[1:30:35] start I look for the glory to be
[1:30:38] restored to a New Testament church
[1:30:41] people who walk in the power of God
[1:30:44] people Daniel because God is God because
[1:30:55] he abundantly loves you and he has a
[1:30:58] passion for his people he's a God who
[1:31:01] cares who said cast all your cares upon
[1:31:05] me for he cares for you remember God
[1:31:12] never forgets a promise hey man what
[1:31:17] time got started well then you're
[1:31:21] wondering what time I'm finished hey man
[1:31:24] I almost feel like John Paul Jones right
[1:31:28] now I just started to fight you say God
[1:31:33] never forgets a promise you see Israel
[1:31:36] but language down in Egypt for 400 years
[1:31:40] but God hadn't forgot when the time a
[1:31:43] promise true nod that which God had
[1:31:45] sworn Abraham the people grew and
[1:31:47] multiplied and Egypt and God sent a
[1:31:50] deliverer in preparation but the time is
[1:31:53] promised God began to move he would he
[1:31:56] would prepare it for it by sending gifts
[1:32:00] on the earth to prepare for his coming
[1:32:03] and for their return to the land and so
[1:32:06] God would do the same thing here there's
[1:32:09] got to be a time of preparation where a
[1:32:11] hearts are turned back to believing
[1:32:13] again and the first section is Godman
[1:32:17] send the Prophet visited him with a
[1:32:18] pillar of fire in a burning bush and
[1:32:21] spoke to him giving him the message of
[1:32:24] the Exodus with a message to Pharaoh let
[1:32:27] my people go and if you don't I'll
[1:32:32] pledge yes
[1:32:33] until you do you know I think sometimes
[1:32:37] it's time to just turn the tables on the
[1:32:40] devil with Jesus come that's what he did
[1:32:43] him a devil scream at his presence they
[1:32:48] screamed out and said what have we doing
[1:32:51] with you that son of God the religious
[1:32:54] men we're calling him a devil and the
[1:32:56] Devils were calling him God sometimes
[1:33:00] theologians don't know and nearly as
[1:33:02] much as what they think they know you
[1:33:05] see it would be them that would reject
[1:33:06] our the Messiah then I wonder today if
[1:33:11] we just need to come down in humility
[1:33:13] and realize that God is God the Bible
[1:33:20] said the Lord is never slack
[1:33:22] according you know concerning his
[1:33:25] promise as men count slackness you see
[1:33:30] the the angel came to Zechariah the
[1:33:32] father john the baptist's because he
[1:33:35] refused to believe and God said his
[1:33:38] mouth to keep him from uttering anymore
[1:33:41] unbelief and I think sometimes for
[1:33:44] because of our own foolish talk and
[1:33:47] compared and negative confessions God
[1:33:50] needs to shut our mouth that's what I
[1:33:53] bring God shut my mouth don't let me say
[1:33:56] anything that would be against your word
[1:33:58] that's what a negative confession is I
[1:34:00] want to confess God is real God is true
[1:34:04] God is merciful God is a healer God is a
[1:34:07] deliverer that's what I want to confess
[1:34:10] man I want to confess that he is my
[1:34:13] righteousness that he became my sin that
[1:34:16] I might become his righteousness so
[1:34:19] therefore I'm holy because he's holy and
[1:34:22] I'm righteous because he is righteous
[1:34:25] you see this time you know where where
[1:34:30] the these words were I had to be full
[1:34:33] filled in their season and I believe
[1:34:35] God's got words that are being fulfilled
[1:34:37] right now in this season I believe we're
[1:34:40] in the season of revival ever a season
[1:34:42] of renewal
[1:34:44] refreshing from the presence of the Lord
[1:34:46] because Peter said before Jesus comes
[1:34:49] back that there would become a times of
[1:34:51] refreshing from the presence of the Lord
[1:34:53] and I say I want to be a part of that
[1:34:57] refreshing a man because the words of
[1:35:00] God are fulfilled in their season you
[1:35:04] said well why didn't it happen when Paul
[1:35:06] said we which are alive and remain some
[1:35:09] two thousand years ago well thank God
[1:35:11] for the sovereignty of God and then
[1:35:13] hills for knowledge because Vidur
[1:35:15] happened then you wouldn't be here right
[1:35:19] remember God has let it come right along
[1:35:22] until ever name that's on the Lamb's
[1:35:24] Book of Life will be manifested on the
[1:35:26] earth and what's that last name is
[1:35:28] manifested on the earth and dipped in
[1:35:30] blood he'll call it to a halt you say
[1:35:35] why why would God have names on the
[1:35:37] Lamb's Book of Life because God knew you
[1:35:41] were coming and he made plans for you
[1:35:45] man
[1:35:46] this is what Jeremiah said in Jeremiah
[1:35:48] 29 I know the plans I have for you
[1:35:51] declares the Lord plans to prosper you
[1:35:54] and not to harm you plans to give you a
[1:35:56] hope and a future a manager you know
[1:36:00] Joshua he would say to Joshua have not I
[1:36:02] commanded you and this is the Lord
[1:36:04] commands early be strong and courageous
[1:36:06] and be not frightened and do not be
[1:36:09] dismayed for the Lord your God is with
[1:36:12] you wherever you go
[1:36:14] a man you see we're know that we are we
[1:36:19] are to speak faith and speak very
[1:36:23] positive of the promises of God you know
[1:36:27] you sometimes weak and false I'm weak
[1:36:30] and faith but we should never say this
[1:36:32] we should say this instead Isaiah 40 29
[1:36:35] he gives power to the faint and to him
[1:36:38] who has no might he increases strength
[1:36:40] and then then he would say in verse 31
[1:36:43] but they the weight of
[1:36:44] the Lord shall renew their strength and
[1:36:47] they shall mount up with wings like
[1:36:48] eagles and they surround and not be
[1:36:51] weary and and they shall walk and shall
[1:36:55] not say hallelujah not you know let me
[1:37:00] just tell you today we we must women we
[1:37:03] must not be passive about this we must
[1:37:05] have a passion about it and that you
[1:37:09] don't stop for nothing that you keep
[1:37:11] moving forward someone said one time if
[1:37:15] you can't fly then run and if you can't
[1:37:16] run then walk and if you can't walk then
[1:37:19] crawl but whatever you do you have to
[1:37:21] keep moving forward amen so what I'm
[1:37:25] saying to you so crawl until you can
[1:37:27] walk and walk until you can run and run
[1:37:29] until you get fried but whatever you do
[1:37:32] quit sitting there in your unbelief in
[1:37:34] your pouch in your fear get up from
[1:37:37] there and move forward
[1:37:39] you never never never never give up you
[1:37:45] never quit believe it you say brother
[1:37:48] Tim where does your street come from it
[1:37:51] would be said in Exodus the Lord is my
[1:37:53] strength and my song and he has become
[1:37:55] my salvation this is my god and I will
[1:37:59] praise him my father's God and I will
[1:38:01] exalt him where is your strength the
[1:38:04] Lord is my strength how can you lose
[1:38:07] when God is on your side DL Moody said
[1:38:11] if a man hasn't been partner with God he
[1:38:15] better have some big plans and I believe
[1:38:18] that God wants us to have big plans and
[1:38:22] plans to overcome plans rise above plans
[1:38:26] to excel plans to move forward this land
[1:38:31] we return to is a land of miracles it's
[1:38:36] a land of the Living God you know where
[1:38:39] he says I'm the LORD thy God that
[1:38:41] healeth all thy diseases we read in
[1:38:44] Leviticus chapter 26 and verse 4 he said
[1:38:47] I'll give you rain and Dew season and
[1:38:50] the land shall yield her increase and
[1:38:52] the trees of the field shall yield their
[1:38:54] fruit so this is a land that will be one
[1:38:57] of constant revival the land of renewing
[1:39:00] the land of refreshing from the presence
[1:39:03] of the Lord it is a land of plenty for
[1:39:06] he says in verse 5 and your threshing to
[1:39:08] reach into the vintage and the miniature
[1:39:10] reach into the sowing time and ye shall
[1:39:13] eat your bread to the full and dwell in
[1:39:15] your land safely no man what is God
[1:39:18] saying to you
[1:39:19] Amen you're not going to have any luck
[1:39:21] I'm gonna supply all your knees your
[1:39:24] threats since I'll reach through the
[1:39:26] wine vintage and the wine vintage sound
[1:39:28] of sowing time and you show you two
[1:39:30] bread to the floor I mean we don't have
[1:39:34] to look at our lives as being half empty
[1:39:37] come on we can look at God would support
[1:39:40] out into us his fullness
[1:39:43] jaunt in and tear he said I have come
[1:39:46] that they might have life and that they
[1:39:48] might have it more abundantly and that
[1:39:50] word abundantly means exceeding any
[1:39:53] number of measurement Ephesians 3:20
[1:40:00] tells us of his ability he is able to do
[1:40:04] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[1:40:06] think or ask or think according to the
[1:40:09] power that worketh within us why is that
[1:40:12] so important to know what he is because
[1:40:15] he says in Deuteronomy 20 and 4 for the
[1:40:18] Lord your God is he who goes with you to
[1:40:21] fight for you against your enemies and
[1:40:23] to give you the victory are you with me
[1:40:26] now this is why he goes before you to
[1:40:29] deliver you from your enemies and give
[1:40:32] you the victory hallelujah that's what
[1:40:35] it means to save you to give you victory
[1:40:38] God's not going to happen to feeted
[1:40:40] people he's gonna happen overcoming
[1:40:41] people a people who believe so we have
[1:40:45] returned to a land of miracles where he
[1:40:48] heals all diseases a man he says in
[1:40:51] verse verse 5 and your we read that on
[1:40:55] the threshing floor let's move on down
[1:40:57] to verse 6 and I will get peace in the
[1:40:59] land you shall light down and none of
[1:41:01] you none shall make you afraid and I
[1:41:04] will rear the evil beast out of the land
[1:41:06] and neither shall the sword go through
[1:41:08] your land so look at these promises
[1:41:11] I'll rid the evil Beast out of the land
[1:41:14] listen and this land Devils are cast out
[1:41:17] Jesus
[1:41:18] any man ever where he went he called it
[1:41:21] sickness Devils come on man their
[1:41:25] sickness of the soul that's in there is
[1:41:28] sickness of the Spirit that's depression
[1:41:30] there is sickness of the body and that's
[1:41:34] all manner of diseases and the principle
[1:41:37] work of the Church of Jesus Christ is to
[1:41:40] rid the land of beasts
[1:41:44] i'ma never spirit that will exalt itself
[1:41:46] against a word of God we are given a
[1:41:49] commission not to live with them but to
[1:41:51] cast them out that's what we stand as
[1:41:54] the children of God Exodus 15:26 he said
[1:41:58] if you will diligently hear the voice of
[1:42:01] the Lord your God and do what's right in
[1:42:03] your sight and give ear to His
[1:42:05] commandments and keep all his statutes I
[1:42:07] will put none of these diseases on you
[1:42:09] which I brought on the Egyptians for I
[1:42:11] am the Lord who heals you do to remedy
[1:42:15] 32:39 now see that I even I am he and
[1:42:20] there is no God beside me I kill and I
[1:42:23] make alive I wound and I heal nor is
[1:42:26] there any who can deliver from my hand
[1:42:28] I'll tell you when God gets after the
[1:42:30] devil they no hope for him
[1:42:34] Alleluia amen when the Saints get to
[1:42:37] pray and things happen and then this is
[1:42:40] the land of Hezekiah who is sick unto
[1:42:42] death who the word the Lord said thus
[1:42:44] said the Lord the God of David your
[1:42:46] father I have heard your prayer I have
[1:42:49] seen your tears and surely I will heal
[1:42:53] you and we can take that for our
[1:42:56] families that are need of healing our
[1:42:59] children that are need of salvation
[1:43:01] amen situations in your home and the
[1:43:04] problems that are there that we can look
[1:43:06] at and just take that to our own selves
[1:43:09] it that he has heard our prayers that he
[1:43:11] has seen our tears and surely I will
[1:43:15] heal you hey man this is a land of David
[1:43:18] where he would say in some sturdy verse
[1:43:21] 1 I will extol you O Lord for you have
[1:43:23] lifted me up and have let not let my
[1:43:26] foes rejoice over me O Lord my god I
[1:43:29] cried out to you and you healed me O
[1:43:31] Lord you brought up my soul from the
[1:43:33] grave you have kept me alive that I
[1:43:35] should not go down to the pit sums 103
[1:43:39] is a exceeding great precious promise
[1:43:42] verse 2 that says bless the Lord O my
[1:43:45] soul and forget not all his benefits who
[1:43:48] forgives all your iniquities who heals
[1:43:51] all your diseases
[1:43:52] who
[1:43:53] your life from destruction who crowns
[1:43:55] you with loving-kindness and tender
[1:43:57] mercy who satisfies your mouth with good
[1:44:00] things so that your users renewed like
[1:44:03] the Eagles the Lord executes
[1:44:05] righteousness and justice for all who
[1:44:07] are oppressed
[1:44:08] are you press this morning he executes
[1:44:12] righteousness and judgment for you that
[1:44:15] are oppressed verse 1 of chapter 107
[1:44:18] verse 17 fools because of their
[1:44:20] transgression because of their iniquity
[1:44:22] is worth like to their souls abhorred
[1:44:25] all manner of food is he and they drew
[1:44:27] near the gates of death then they cried
[1:44:30] to the Lord and the trouble and it saved
[1:44:32] them out of their distresses he sent His
[1:44:34] Word and healed them and delivered them
[1:44:37] from their destructions oh that men
[1:44:39] would give thanks to the Lord for His
[1:44:41] goodness and for his wonderful works to
[1:44:44] the children of men that's what we're
[1:44:46] here today for we're here to give thanks
[1:44:49] back to God for something great he did
[1:44:52] among us a man showing himself as a
[1:44:55] healer a man showing himself is
[1:44:58] delivered we see him from proverbs 3 and
[1:45:01] verse 5 trust in the Lord with all your
[1:45:03] heart lean not on your own understanding
[1:45:05] and all your ways acknowledge him and he
[1:45:08] shall direct your path don't be wise in
[1:45:11] your own eyes fear the Lord and depart
[1:45:13] from evil it'll be helped to your bones
[1:45:15] or help to your flesh since trick to
[1:45:18] your bones it would be Isaiah that would
[1:45:21] see him coming our delivers on his way
[1:45:24] surely he would be he had borne our
[1:45:27] griefs isaiah 53:4 and it's carried our
[1:45:30] sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken
[1:45:33] smitten by God and afflicted but he was
[1:45:36] wounded for our transgressions he was
[1:45:39] bruised for our iniquities the
[1:45:41] chastisement for our peace was upon him
[1:45:44] and by His stripes we are healed all we
[1:45:49] like sheep have gone astray we have
[1:45:51] turned every one to his own way and the
[1:45:53] Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us
[1:45:56] all it would be Isaiah 61 that would
[1:46:00] prophesy of him saying the spear the
[1:46:02] Lord is upon me because the Lord
[1:46:05] anointed me to preach good tidings to
[1:46:07] the poor he sent me to heal the
[1:46:09] brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the
[1:46:12] captives and open and the prison to
[1:46:14] those that are who are bound to proclaim
[1:46:16] the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:46:18] and the day of vengeance of our God and
[1:46:20] to comfort all that mourn I say what a
[1:46:23] savior we have today a man the healer is
[1:46:27] in the house
[1:46:28] and that's why we can proclaim what
[1:46:31] Jeremiah said in 1714 heal me O Lord and
[1:46:35] I shall be healed
[1:46:37] save me and I shall be saved for you or
[1:46:40] my praise Jim I would say in chapter 30
[1:46:44] in verse 17 for I will restore health to
[1:46:46] you and heal you of your wounds saith
[1:46:49] the Lord because they called you an
[1:46:52] outcast saying this is ioan no one seeks
[1:46:55] her verse 6 of chapter 33 sym behold I
[1:46:59] will bring health and healing I will
[1:47:01] heal them and reveal to them the
[1:47:03] abundance of peace and truth Hosea
[1:47:07] 6 and once has come and let us return to
[1:47:10] the Lord for he at thorn and he will
[1:47:12] heal as he was speaking but he will bind
[1:47:13] us up after two days he will revive us
[1:47:16] on the third day he will raise us up
[1:47:18] that we may live in his sight let us
[1:47:20] know let us pursue the knowledge of the
[1:47:23] Lord his going forth is established as
[1:47:26] the morning he will come to us like the
[1:47:28] rain like the ladder and the former rain
[1:47:30] to the earth this was a land of victory
[1:47:34] this in this land of promise I'm come
[1:47:37] battle and the promise now they're
[1:47:39] making their Aliyah they're coming back

[1:50:13] for God and he's coming back again for
[1:50:16] people who have made her separating and
[1:50:20] until he comes we're gonna lean on the
[1:50:22] everlasting arms hallelujah
[1:50:27] hey man they get ready to start this
[1:50:31] film right now I want you just to say

[1:50:45] David you're here I want you to stand
[1:50:47] this is her husband we have no reason to
[1:50:53] fear anything now when we got a God like
[1:50:56] ours now the David's a medical
[1:51:00] professional profession he knows what it
[1:51:03] is to have the diagnosis his wife had oh
[1:51:07] yeah there was those times of
[1:51:09] desperation when he got down on his
[1:51:11] knees fell on the floor sobbing and
[1:51:14] crying and God heard their cries they
[1:51:21] leaned on those everlasting arms I want
[1:51:25] you to listen today is I encourage you
[1:51:27] to do the same thing lean on those
[1:51:30] everlasting farm arms there's nothing
[1:51:32] for you to dread nothing for you to fear

[1:51:40] like ours Jesus Christ the same
[1:51:43] yesterday today and forever
[1:51:56] [Music]
[1:52:05] [Music]
[1:52:25] we made an appointment with my primary
[1:52:28] care physician who had ordered the
[1:52:30] allergy testing to start with
[1:52:32] and she just I told her about my cough
[1:52:35] that was going on and that had gotten
[1:52:39] worse I told her about the fatigue that
[1:52:41] was bothering me the aversion to food
[1:52:43] and about
[1:52:44] just overall malaise that I was dealing
[1:52:47] with and she automatically just ordered
[1:52:49] a chest x-ray I showed her the lumps on
[1:52:52] my chest and she thought it might be in
[1:52:53] the rib cage in the bone and so she
[1:52:57] decided to order chest x-ray and who
[1:52:59] wanted it kind of a strange angle that
[1:53:00] actually shows the bone structure as
[1:53:02] well and fell so I went to the hospital
[1:53:06] and had that done and David was in there
[1:53:09] with me when I had the x-ray done and
[1:53:12] when he saw the x-ray he was very
[1:53:15] alarmed because the hole right long area
[1:53:19] was totally white and being in the
[1:53:23] medical field himself he's seen x-rays
[1:53:25] many x-rays before and he knew that this
[1:53:28] was not just a little cough problem
[1:53:31] anymore and so um the next day the
[1:53:37] doctor called me in she fed Elana she
[1:53:40] said I'm looking at your report of your
[1:53:42] x-ray and she said I do not like what
[1:53:46] I'm what I see here and she said there's
[1:53:51] a mass in your lung and she said it
[1:53:55] looks like cancer she said now I want
[1:53:58] you to see an oncologist but and I she
[1:54:01] said I can't say for sure that it's
[1:54:03] cancer I've been wrong twice this year I
[1:54:06] sent somebody to an oncology and call
[1:54:08] oncologists who thought it was I thought
[1:54:11] it was lung cancer and it turned out
[1:54:13] that it was not it was a strange
[1:54:15] infection she said so I could be wrong
[1:54:17] on this but I do want you to be prepared
[1:54:19] that it's quite possible that this is
[1:54:21] what is going on here and so you can
[1:54:25] imagine the shock that we felt at
[1:54:28] something that we felt was probably just
[1:54:30] going to be a routine checkup and
[1:54:33] some pneumonia or something like that
[1:54:35] and so this was a Friday and we had the
[1:54:38] weekend to digest this information and
[1:54:42] so we let family and friends know I
[1:54:44] called my mom and told her and she she
[1:54:47] said Elena she said you can tell me
[1:54:50] these things before they escalate to a
[1:54:51] point like this and I said mom you've
[1:54:53] known everything that has happened I
[1:54:55] said you know as much as I've known but
[1:54:57] I didn't realize either I had no idea it
[1:54:59] happened so gradually I didn't realize
[1:55:01] that these symptoms were all together
[1:55:04] pointing to something that potentially
[1:55:08] so anyway and we we told people in the
[1:55:11] church and they began praying and things
[1:55:13] and um we didn't get very much sleep
[1:55:16] that night as we considered the
[1:55:19] possibilities of course your mind just
[1:55:21] tends to go very extreme in a case like
[1:55:27] that and so David was up walking the
[1:55:30] driveway 3:30 the next morning and it
[1:55:34] was actually very hard to look at each
[1:55:35] other um during that weekend because you
[1:55:39] know that it could be something that
[1:55:44] would take you away from each other and
[1:55:47] um
[1:55:50] it was something that's actually
[1:55:51] indescribable unless you've gone through
[1:55:53] it but I just I just felt like God is
[1:56:00] God and I felt like this time I could
[1:56:03] trust him and from the beginning I made
[1:56:06] a decision that I was going to look to
[1:56:08] the Word of God and that I was not going
[1:56:10] to fear this thing and of course you
[1:56:13] cannot stop the thoughts that come into
[1:56:14] your mind at a moment like this but when
[1:56:17] they would come in I would say but the
[1:56:19] Word of God says he's a healer of all my
[1:56:21] diseases and so Saturday the next day we
[1:56:27] sat down with our children in the living
[1:56:28] room and we told them we said they've
[1:56:33] all been raised in a Christian home they
[1:56:35] you know from the day they were born and
[1:56:37] we said this is what the doctor is found
[1:56:40] it could be an infection and it could be
[1:56:43] cancer and we believe we're believing
[1:56:45] for it to be an infection but we said if
[1:56:48] it's not God is still God and we're
[1:56:51] making a choice to just believe him
[1:56:53] we're not gonna fear this thing we said
[1:56:56] all the shouting and praising the Lord
[1:56:58] that we do in church all the singing
[1:57:00] that we do it's all about this moment
[1:57:02] we've not had huge trials in our family
[1:57:05] and if this is our moment we're going to
[1:57:07] trust God and we're gonna be real
[1:57:08] soldiers and do it with all our heart
[1:57:10] and so we were talking to them and David
[1:57:14] said some things to them along the same
[1:57:16] lines and the Holy Spirit just came down
[1:57:18] in that room
[1:57:21] and it brought such comfort to my heart
[1:57:25] I've always wondered you know we have a
[1:57:28] lady and a couple in our church who has
[1:57:31] who lost a child and through sickness
[1:57:35] and heart problems and I wondered at the
[1:57:38] time how do they walk through this with
[1:57:39] such dignity and in that moment I knew
[1:57:43] how you do it because God is a comforter
[1:57:47] such peace in my life I felt at that
[1:57:50] moment
[1:57:51] so we just talked with the family and
[1:57:54] prayed together and then everybody went
[1:57:57] away and then David went outside and
[1:57:59] proceeded to mow all 20 acres of our
[1:58:01] property I was concerned about the trees
[1:58:04] and everything as he just digested all
[1:58:07] of this and started to fight his own
[1:58:09] battle which is unique to somebody who
[1:58:11] works in the medical field but I was
[1:58:14] texting a friend later on and I told her
[1:58:17] I said I can walk through anything if
[1:58:19] that presence is with me like it was
[1:58:21] today but this time there was a banker
[1:58:29] that have been missing the year before
[1:58:41] so next I was scheduled to start seeing
[1:58:44] an oncologist and so I did that we went
[1:58:48] to my first appointment and he asked me
[1:58:50] of course about all my symptoms and all
[1:58:52] of that and I just as as we were there
[1:58:56] he just said I don't think you had lung
[1:58:58] cancer and I said oh so you don't think
[1:59:00] I have cancer he said no I don't think
[1:59:01] you have lung cancer he said your
[1:59:03] symptoms don't fit that he said perhaps
[1:59:05] lymphoma he said perhaps tuberculosis or
[1:59:08] some infection like that we really don't
[1:59:10] know and so we're gonna start running
[1:59:11] some tests so they did a whole series of
[1:59:16] blood work you know vials for blood work
[1:59:18] and and started doing some testing and
[1:59:22] ordered a CT scan and that showed up
[1:59:26] that I had a lymph node swollen under my
[1:59:28] arm which turned out to be 2 or 3
[1:59:30] centimeters in size but I didn't know
[1:59:33] about it was deep enough and so he
[1:59:35] ordered a he ordered a biopsy of that
[1:59:39] lymph node now as I said I've never
[1:59:42] really had any procedures done or
[1:59:44] anything and just the thought of that
[1:59:46] was very unnerving to me and I just I
[1:59:48] told people I don't do pain you know
[1:59:50] they sound uncomfortable I don't do pain
[1:59:52] you know and so it was everything from
[1:59:57] the ground up was a new experience to me
[2:00:00] and it was very frightening at the onset
[2:00:02] and I just said God I'm looking to you
[2:00:05] for everything that I go through you
[2:00:07] will be with me whether I feel it or not
[2:00:09] these different hospitals that I'm being
[2:00:11] sent to in different clinics they're all
[2:00:14] they all have their own atmosphere and
[2:00:16] many of them are not atmospheres of
[2:00:18] faith and you kind of feel like you're
[2:00:20] you know the only one in there but that
[2:00:23] that believes but
[2:00:26] somehow I just believe the Lord would be
[2:00:28] with me and now and then I did have a
[2:00:31] really nice experience with somebody who
[2:00:33] was a Christian
[2:00:34] the lady who drew my blood at the
[2:00:35] oncologist that she drew it she said
[2:00:38] we're just gonna pray that every one of
[2:00:40] these comes back negative and it would
[2:00:41] just be a very positive thing in your
[2:00:43] day as you were fighting your mind
[2:00:46] battles they did the biopsy under my arm
[2:00:49] they did a bronchoscopy where they went
[2:00:53] down and biopsied inside my lung and did
[2:00:57] some took some cultures out of there to
[2:00:59] test for infection they were very
[2:01:01] perplexed by my case because my symptoms
[2:01:03] didn't specifically match cancer or
[2:01:06] infection and meanwhile I was just
[2:01:10] feeling worse and worse all the time
[2:01:12] Mike off had gotten very bad and then I
[2:01:15] started to have a weight in my stomach
[2:01:18] almost like when you're expecting a baby
[2:01:19] that is so I felt like I needed to
[2:01:21] stretch out like this a lot of the time
[2:01:23] and at this time I can only figure that
[2:01:26] it had something to do with my lung not
[2:01:28] wanting to expand properly but my
[2:01:32] appetite was just I had no appetite
[2:01:35] whatsoever as they did these different
[2:01:37] tests everything came back negative they
[2:01:41] just were as I said very perplexed by it
[2:01:45] and finally they decided that I needed
[2:01:47] to have a lung surgery called a vat done
[2:01:49] where they go in from the side and they
[2:01:51] take pretty impressive wedges out of
[2:01:54] your lung and test that for infection
[2:01:58] and for any sort of cancer and so
[2:02:02] meanwhile my mom having found out that I
[2:02:05] had the mass in my lung decided to come
[2:02:07] visit and she lives in Canada where I am
[2:02:09] originally from and so she decided to
[2:02:12] come stay with me if only to cook
[2:02:13] because if I cooked my own food it made
[2:02:16] it that much harder to eat it so um she
[2:02:19] came and stayed with me and started
[2:02:20] helping with the housework and helping
[2:02:22] with the children because I was
[2:02:25] just becoming less and less able to care
[2:02:28] for myself and just losing interest in
[2:02:31] life in general
[2:02:32] and so um she came and stayed with me
[2:02:34] and and so when I had the surgery she
[2:02:38] stayed with the children and the surgery
[2:02:41] went very well and they did some testing
[2:02:43] during the surgery and found out that
[2:02:45] there was nothing everything was coming
[2:02:47] back negative and so after my um
[2:02:51] after the surgery was over I had a
[2:02:54] follow-up appointment this by now we're
[2:02:56] into December from October to December
[2:02:58] they were doing all this testing I'd
[2:03:01] seen a couple of pulmonologists
[2:03:03] different pulmonologists and was kind of
[2:03:06] being passed around from one facility to
[2:03:07] another while I did testing the day that
[2:03:10] I went in to have my surgery done of
[2:03:14] course this was a bigger deal even and
[2:03:16] the other procedures that I'd had done
[2:03:18] and naturally I wasn't looking forward
[2:03:20] to it and I read a sermon by William
[2:03:25] Brennan which is something that I do
[2:03:27] regularly because I I feed on those
[2:03:29] sermons they're a lifeline to me they're
[2:03:32] so inspired by God and and he was
[2:03:35] speaking about Satan and he said Satan
[2:03:37] following you along that great big king
[2:03:40] kingly priestly colide trying to scare
[2:03:44] the liver right of you but you're
[2:03:46] fortified by the word and as I went in
[2:03:49] for this surgery
[2:03:50] I said yes that is exactly what it is
[2:03:52] this Goliath is trying to scare the
[2:03:54] liver out of me
[2:03:55] and I refuse to bow to that and I have
[2:03:58] the Word of God that is going to protect
[2:03:59] me no matter what I go through and that
[2:04:02] is what I told people when they'd asked
[2:04:04] how I was doing I would say I feel
[2:04:05] rotten
[2:04:06] I have no appetite and God is with me
[2:04:09] and God is my healer and that was my
[2:04:11] confession throughout this entire
[2:04:14] or deal and it wasn't what I always felt
[2:04:17] but it's what I always believed
[2:04:18] so a week after my surgery I had a
[2:04:23] follow-up appointment by now we were
[2:04:24] into well into December and so when I
[2:04:29] went there the doctor said he said we've
[2:04:32] sent you're the cultures and biopsies
[2:04:35] and things off to the University of
[2:04:37] Michigan for a second opinion on them
[2:04:39] and he said I don't think you have
[2:04:40] cancer he said maybe you'll have just an
[2:04:44] interesting infection named after you
[2:04:46] and it was kind of a light-hearted
[2:04:48] conversation but it's very positive he
[2:04:50] said those results will take about two
[2:04:52] weeks to get back or could take up to
[2:04:54] two weeks and so I left and the very
[2:04:58] next day I had an appointment at another
[2:05:00] hospital and this was a follow-up from a
[2:05:02] previous bronchoscopy that I'd had done
[2:05:06] it was a lesser test and we already had
[2:05:09] gotten all the results back from that
[2:05:11] and everything had been negative on
[2:05:13] infection and so we actually thought
[2:05:15] about not showing up for that
[2:05:17] appointment and just calling and
[2:05:18] cancelling it because we were past that
[2:05:20] into the bigger surgery but decided just
[2:05:22] to keep the appointment and these this
[2:05:25] pulmonologist had been in contact with
[2:05:27] the surgeon who had just done the major
[2:05:29] surgery and they'd been talking back and
[2:05:31] forth about the results
[2:05:33] so David and I went to this appointment
[2:05:35] at hospital and the appointment it the
[2:05:39] wait was very long the children were at
[2:05:41] home waiting for supper and hours were
[2:05:43] passing I felt as sick as a dog I would
[2:05:46] get up and walk around to feel a little
[2:05:48] better and then I'd sit down trying to
[2:05:50] feel a little better and I was just
[2:05:51] feeling bad by this time I was having
[2:05:53] severe sweats where I would just soak
[2:05:56] through a whole layer of clothes just
[2:05:58] when everybody else was freezing and so
[2:06:00] I was sweating profusely when the doctor
[2:06:03] came in he sat down and he said so
[2:06:06] you've you've gotten your results that
[2:06:07] you have Hodgkin's lymphoma and I just
[2:06:10] stared at him I said no I said I think
[2:06:12] that was being considered but they've
[2:06:14] sent the results off to the University
[2:06:16] of Michigan and it will be a few weeks
[2:06:17] before we get them back and he said no
[2:06:19] these are the results from the
[2:06:21] University of Michigan they just came in
[2:06:23] and he said you have vodka and some FOMA
[2:06:24] and he had assumed that we knew this
[2:06:28] and I was just in shock I could just
[2:06:31] feel my face just turning hot you know
[2:06:33] moving up and David was just staring at
[2:06:36] him and he started to talk about what
[2:06:40] Hodgkin's lymphoma was classical
[2:06:42] Hodgkin's lymphoma and he said it's the
[2:06:46] good news is that it's treatable he said
[2:06:48] you should regain back lung function and
[2:06:51] he said we treat it with chemotherapy
[2:06:53] and radiation and he said your doctor
[2:06:57] your oncologist has been informed and
[2:06:59] about that time David's phone started
[2:07:01] ringing and it was already my oncologist
[2:07:02] calling him and we were just stunned and
[2:07:07] he said you have any questions and I
[2:07:10] said well I just need some time to
[2:07:12] digest this I I guess I just need to
[2:07:14] think about it before I come up with
[2:07:16] questions and he said I'm sorry to
[2:07:18] deliver this news to you week before
[2:07:21] Christmas and I said well no you can't
[2:07:22] help that we drove home and
[2:07:26] he said you can you talk to the kids cuz
[2:07:29] you tell them what you want them to know
[2:07:30] okay we went in and we told the kids we
[2:07:34] said the doctors have talked to us and
[2:07:36] they've told us I do have cancer and we
[2:07:39] said this changes nothing we said what
[2:07:41] we told you about this situation at the
[2:07:44] beginning is what we hold to right now
[2:07:46] is that God is a healer we are not gonna
[2:07:48] fear this thing we said mama mama might
[2:07:52] get really sick for a while and we need
[2:07:54] you guys to be the very best you can be
[2:07:57] but you know things might look a little
[2:08:00] rough around here for a while but we're
[2:08:01] gonna just work together
[2:08:03] and we're just gonna trust God that
[2:08:05] everything's gonna be okay
[2:08:07] and my mom had actually gone back home
[2:08:09] when I'd had this lung surgery after it
[2:08:12] was over she'd gone back home we thought
[2:08:14] oh we were gonna get I was gonna take
[2:08:16] some antibiotics and everything was
[2:08:17] going to be fine and so she had not
[2:08:20] planned to come back but we we called
[2:08:24] her and let her know what was gonna
[2:08:25] happen
[2:08:25] what was happening and told the family
[2:08:27] in the church and in and so that just
[2:08:32] opened a whole new chapter for us
[2:08:44] the oncologist wanted to meet with us
[2:08:46] right away after after everything this
[2:08:50] diagnosis so the next day we met with
[2:08:52] him and he sat down and she gave me the
[2:08:54] papers with what drugs I would be
[2:08:57] receiving he told me that I would
[2:09:00] probably require radiation because the
[2:09:03] tumor in my lung was about seven
[2:09:06] centimeters big and he said with that
[2:09:09] tumor burden that's how he referred to
[2:09:11] it he said usually we do radiation but
[2:09:15] because of its location you would
[2:09:17] actually be injuring the breast as well
[2:09:19] and a lot of times women will end up
[2:09:21] having breast cancer from the radiation
[2:09:23] years down the road if they're young
[2:09:24] enough to live that long and he already
[2:09:28] had three patients who had that problem
[2:09:30] from having had radiation so he was
[2:09:32] hesitant to do that but yet felt like it
[2:09:35] might be necessary
[2:09:37] regardless he said I would need the full
[2:09:40] regimen of chemotherapy for Hodgkin's
[2:09:42] lymphoma he said it was Stage four
[2:09:44] because it was already in an organ and
[2:09:47] he said that would include 12 treatments
[2:09:50] two weeks apart and it was four separate
[2:09:53] drugs he said they'd recently switched
[2:09:56] out one drug because it was better on
[2:10:00] the lung than what the previous drug had
[2:10:02] been and this was a very recent
[2:10:04] development although it it had been
[2:10:05] studied for a few years but that was
[2:10:08] good news to me because my problem was
[2:10:09] literally in the lung and I didn't need
[2:10:11] more problems in my lung as well but he
[2:10:14] just said I'm gonna sit down and tell
[2:10:16] you what you can expect with
[2:10:17] chemotherapy and he said when you've had
[2:10:19] enough you tell me because this is very
[2:10:21] overwhelming information and
[2:10:24] I understand that and we can pick up
[2:10:26] another time if you know when you've had
[2:10:29] enough so he started to write down the
[2:10:32] side effects that I would deal with and
[2:10:34] how I would feel this day and you know
[2:10:37] just launched into it and it was just
[2:10:40] surreal really you picture other people
[2:10:44] going through this sort of thing but you
[2:10:45] never picture yourself in that situation
[2:10:47] but somehow when I came away from that
[2:10:51] appointment for some reason I actually
[2:10:53] felt a little better I guess
[2:10:56] unknown can be more fearful than being
[2:10:59] told exactly what to expect and he is a
[2:11:00] very gentle very gentle doctor and very
[2:11:05] kind and understanding and so he just
[2:11:07] explained what to expect and I realized
[2:11:09] that he does this every day and anyway
[2:11:12] somehow I came away not feeling like I
[2:11:15] was going to make it I I don't know how
[2:11:18] to explain the fact that you can feel
[2:11:21] like you're on a runaway cart while you
[2:11:23] also feel like God is in control and so
[2:11:29] after that I was put through a series of
[2:11:33] tests I had to have my lungs tested to
[2:11:36] see if they could stand up to
[2:11:38] chemotherapy they did a heart test as
[2:11:41] well they I met with a doctor to have my
[2:11:45] port put in which they would use to put
[2:11:48] the chemotherapy into my body and all of
[2:11:51] this was just of course very a lot to
[2:11:54] take in in just a couple of days
[2:11:55] especially when I thought I was going to
[2:11:58] go on antibiotics for an infection and
[2:12:00] so that we received the diagnosis on
[2:12:03] Tuesday met with the doctor on Wednesday
[2:12:05] before Christmas and had appointments
[2:12:09] the next day and so by Friday it was a
[2:12:13] first day for me to be home quietly
[2:12:15] since my diagnosis I hadn't really had a
[2:12:18] good cry about it I hadn't had time to
[2:12:19] think much about it but that day I had
[2:12:22] some time to myself and it started to
[2:12:24] sink in as to what was ahead of me and I
[2:12:26] was feeling very sick already and I just
[2:12:30] felt like I would not be able to fight
[2:12:33] you have to fight through chemotherapy
[2:12:36] and I thought I don't have fight in me
[2:12:38] I'm already sick and tired of being sick
[2:12:41] and tired and so I was overwhelmed by
[2:12:44] what was ahead of me and frankly I
[2:12:47] started to become frightened
[2:12:49] and I was just thinking about it and I
[2:12:51] just thought I cannot do this I said
[2:12:53] lord I know you're gonna be with me you
[2:12:55] said you would be but I don't want to go
[2:12:57] through it and so the next morning David
[2:12:59] was doing some work in the garage and I
[2:13:01] went out and that's what I told him I
[2:13:03] said David I just I started to cry I
[2:13:05] said I don't want to go through this I
[2:13:08] know God is gonna help me I don't doubt
[2:13:10] that for a second but I just don't even
[2:13:11] want to go near it he said I wish I
[2:13:14] could take some of it from you and I
[2:13:15] said I wish you could too
[2:13:17] I was desperate at that point but um he
[2:13:21] just held me for a few minutes and I had
[2:13:22] a little cry and I went back in the
[2:13:25] house and I picked up my phone and there
[2:13:27] was a screenshot that Naomi will send a
[2:13:30] girl in our church and sent me and it
[2:13:33] was a little potation from a sermon
[2:13:35] called hear his voice and it said don't
[2:13:38] be scared honey God is watching you the
[2:13:40] devil may try to do something to you but
[2:13:42] God's greater and it was taken from the
[2:13:45] sermon where William Branham was talking
[2:13:48] about Marion putting Moses in the
[2:13:50] bulrushes and that's what I felt that's
[2:13:54] how I felt at that moment is that I was
[2:13:56] launching out into something way out of
[2:13:58] my control and way out of just beyond
[2:14:03] anything that I felt like I was prepared
[2:14:06] for but yet when that came through on my
[2:14:08] phone phone I knew that was God that
[2:14:10] caused her to send that to me and I felt
[2:14:14] it was supernatural just like reading
[2:14:16] about the girl healed of Hodgkin's
[2:14:18] lymphoma I knew that was a supernatural
[2:14:20] moment because we serve a supernatural
[2:14:24] God and He will be there for you and
[2:14:26] whatever you go through and in your most
[2:14:28] desperate and dark times
[2:14:30] and I felt that found that for myself it
[2:14:35] just gave me courage once again to know
[2:14:37] that he was gonna be with me so this was
[2:14:39] Saturday the following Monday was
[2:14:41] Christmas and it was the strangest
[2:14:43] Christmas of my life I felt as sick as a
[2:14:45] dog I saw on social media everybody's
[2:14:48] celebrating with their families and I
[2:14:50] felt so strange I felt like nothing in
[2:14:52] my life was recognizable anymore nothing
[2:14:54] in my body was recognizable anymore
[2:14:57] and I almost didn't know how to interact
[2:14:59] with my family because I thought what if
[2:15:01] I am to be taken away from them there's
[2:15:04] there's all these thoughts that go
[2:15:05] through your mind you know but I just
[2:15:08] when I'd have these thoughts I would
[2:15:09] just turn from them and say God you are
[2:15:11] my healer you said you'd be with me I
[2:15:13] don't know where this is going to take
[2:15:14] me but you said you would be with me and
[2:15:16] that's I kept going back to that and
[2:15:18] kept going back to that I thought I'm
[2:15:21] gonna be a real soldier and a real child
[2:15:23] of God and I put my trust in the fact
[2:15:25] that he loves me whether I was feeling
[2:15:28] it at that moment or not he's his
[2:15:30] promises to his children are full of
[2:15:32] love and compassion and so that's what I
[2:15:35] trusted and in those moments where the
[2:15:38] things life was very overwhelming
[2:15:40] the day after Christmas I went in for
[2:15:43] surgery to have my port inserted into my
[2:15:45] shoulder area and when I got up that
[2:15:50] morning on my phone there there was a
[2:15:53] scripture I because I have the Bible app
[2:15:55] and it was Isaiah 41:10 feared though
[2:15:59] not for I'm with thee be not dismayed
[2:16:01] for I am thy God I will strengthen thee
[2:16:03] yea I will help thee yea I will uphold
[2:16:06] thee with the right my right hand of
[2:16:08] righteousness
[2:16:09] and I felt like God gave me that
[2:16:12] scripture for that day and that is a
[2:16:14] scripture that carried me through my
[2:16:16] chemotherapy I posted all over my house
[2:16:19] and read it daily
[2:16:20] many times a day sometimes I will help
[2:16:22] thee that when I needed help I'd say God
[2:16:25] I'd hold him to it I think God you said
[2:16:27] you would help me and I am looking to
[2:16:29] you for that help I need it this moment
[2:16:31] and that day that morning when I went in
[2:16:37] for surgery
[2:16:38] Beth Adams a girl in our church sent me
[2:16:40] that same scripture she also had the
[2:16:42] Bible app and it popped up on her phone
[2:16:44] and she sent it to me and I set out of
[2:16:46] the mouth of two or three witnesses it
[2:16:48] was like God in an audible voice with
[2:16:50] telling me I've got this and we're gonna
[2:16:52] be okay
[2:16:54] [Music]
[2:17:02] the next day was Wednesday I was
[2:17:05] scheduled for a PET scan and that shows
[2:17:08] where cancer is located in your body
[2:17:09] because they knew it was in the lung but
[2:17:11] they didn't know where else and they
[2:17:13] didn't do it prior to this time because
[2:17:15] insurance will not cover it unless they
[2:17:17] already know you have cancer and so I
[2:17:21] went from my PET scan and I came home I
[2:17:26] was there a few hours and I came home
[2:17:28] and I was resting from that because they
[2:17:30] give you valium and David came home from
[2:17:33] work he said doctor the doctor wants you
[2:17:35] to come in and start chemotherapy today
[2:17:37] and I was like here we go okay let's go
[2:17:42] so I got up right then we left the
[2:17:45] children at home and we went in for my
[2:17:47] first chemotherapy appointment every
[2:17:52] treatment I took David and I just prayed
[2:17:54] over it
[2:17:55] we we'd always said if it ever came to
[2:17:58] the time when we had cancer or anything
[2:18:01] we probably wouldn't take any more
[2:18:02] therapy we we discussed it a few times I
[2:18:04] would hate to go through that it just
[2:18:06] wouldn't be worth it but when it was
[2:18:08] when I found out I had cancer there was
[2:18:11] no question in my mind that I was to
[2:18:13] take the chemotherapy I did not feel
[2:18:15] like I was to take the radiation and I
[2:18:17] felt from the beginning that that was
[2:18:19] not an option for me and I didn't tell
[2:18:21] the doctor that but I told other people
[2:18:23] I won't be taking the radiation I'm
[2:18:25] gonna trust God with that part that
[2:18:26] he'll take care of that so we prayed
[2:18:30] over the chemotherapy treatment that it
[2:18:32] would go right to its mark and do it it
[2:18:34] was supposed to do and that I would not
[2:18:36] have to deal with horrible side effects
[2:18:38] and I always am amazed that in the Old
[2:18:42] Testament God would say to the
[2:18:44] Israelites the diseases that come upon
[2:18:47] the other nations will not come upon you
[2:18:49] and the things that they deal with it's
[2:18:52] different for you and I felt
[2:18:53] I'm his every every bit his child as
[2:18:56] much as what those people were and so I
[2:18:58] can have expectations that I get special
[2:19:01] treatment not because I'm better than
[2:19:03] anybody else but just because I'm his
[2:19:05] child
[2:19:06] and that is not unique to me it's just
[2:19:08] unique to his children and that's
[2:19:10] something that I began to just believe
[2:19:12] for myself so they told me each
[2:19:16] treatment is gonna you're gonna feel a
[2:19:18] little worse they put a little bit more
[2:19:21] of the medication in every time your
[2:19:23] body it's very foreign to your body and
[2:19:25] your body's not gonna like it
[2:19:26] and so they said you could feel
[2:19:30] progressively worse with each treatment
[2:19:31] a lot of medications to help me get
[2:19:34] through the treatments the stomach
[2:19:35] problems that they expect you to have
[2:19:37] the nausea to ward off any vomiting and
[2:19:41] things like that they tell you're gonna
[2:19:43] feel very fatigued you know they just
[2:19:47] prepare you for all sorts of things and
[2:19:49] they actually don't prepare you for
[2:19:50] everything
[2:19:50] only the top five and so um I went home
[2:19:55] and it started a whole new cycle for me
[2:19:58] because not only was i dealing with
[2:20:00] lymphoma
[2:20:00] I was also dealing with the chemotherapy
[2:20:02] treatments and so
[2:20:05] by this time I was so sick that I was
[2:20:08] talking very little around the house if
[2:20:12] the kids wanted to know can I can we go
[2:20:13] here can we do this I'd say ask a bath
[2:20:15] daddy that's about as much as I wanted
[2:20:17] to say I did not want to make decisions
[2:20:19] I'd lost interest in all of that I cared
[2:20:22] about my kids but I could not I felt too
[2:20:24] sick to even make basic decisions with
[2:20:27] regards to them and then like I said
[2:20:30] there is all sorts of other things that
[2:20:32] started happening literally from the
[2:20:33] moment the chemotherapy goes into your
[2:20:36] body you start to notice things and I
[2:20:39] just began turning these things over to
[2:20:42] God you know they said watch for
[2:20:43] tingling and numbness in your fingers
[2:20:45] and in your toes for neuropathy and so
[2:20:49] when I'd start to feel the tingling I'd
[2:20:51] say god I can't do anything about this
[2:20:53] but you said you would help me and you
[2:20:55] said you're a healer and I'm praying
[2:20:56] that you will take care of my
[2:20:58] extremities my lung by this time felt
[2:21:01] like it was made of lead it felt like
[2:21:03] there was no expansion in it it got
[2:21:05] worse I would get up at night and I
[2:21:08] would when I would breathe in those
[2:21:10] first few breaths when I got out of bed
[2:21:11] at night it felt like the breath came
[2:21:14] out in in three pieces it was like and
[2:21:19] before it would really start coming out
[2:21:21] normal and I felt like it was scraping
[2:21:23] over bones I don't really know what to
[2:21:25] this day what was happening but it felt
[2:21:27] like it was scraping over something
[2:21:28] inside and it was very frightening in
[2:21:30] itself
[2:21:31] and I just thought I am NOT gonna worry
[2:21:33] about this
[2:21:34] I cannot worry about this God you
[2:21:35] created my lung I believe that you're
[2:21:37] gonna heal it and I would go to the
[2:21:40] restroom do what I had to do and go back
[2:21:41] to bed and just go back to sleep and
[2:21:44] that's what I did all day every day when
[2:21:47] I had to eat a meal which was one of the
[2:21:50] most horrific things that I dealt with
[2:21:52] during this entire time was having to
[2:21:53] make myself eat and
[2:21:56] I would say God just get me through this
[2:21:58] Emil help me to get it down because I've
[2:21:59] got to keep this weight on by the time I
[2:22:03] was at the end of my first treatment I
[2:22:05] was I had dropped about nine pounds from
[2:22:09] my pre fitness weight which on my frame
[2:22:12] who is very significant and worrisome I
[2:22:15] no longer was recognizing my body the
[2:22:18] way it felt even sitting on a chair was
[2:22:20] uncomfortable and it was overwhelming
[2:22:24] and I said God I'm looking to you to
[2:22:26] help me with my meals to help me gain
[2:22:28] weight
[2:22:28] I was um at 2,000 calories a day I was
[2:22:32] still losing weight I had to get over
[2:22:35] 2,000 I had to get 2,000 calories to
[2:22:38] maintain weight at least and to gain it
[2:22:41] was more like 2300 calories a day and I
[2:22:43] was doing nothing so my body was just
[2:22:46] working through an unbelievable rate and
[2:22:51] my mom spent a good part of her day
[2:22:52] trying to get fat into me she would pour
[2:22:55] oil over my lasagna she would give me a
[2:22:58] glass of orange juice with oil in them I
[2:23:00] would have cereal with heavy whipping
[2:23:02] cream on them we would just do anything
[2:23:04] we could to make to get extreme amounts
[2:23:08] of calories in small amounts of food
[2:23:10] because I could not take in large
[2:23:12] amounts of food so my bathroom started
[2:23:16] to look like a pharmacy with all the
[2:23:19] medications that the doctor given me
[2:23:20] I've never been one to take more than
[2:23:22] one ibuprofen at a time thankfully I've
[2:23:24] been very healthy and rarely needed it
[2:23:26] and I hated to even take any of the
[2:23:30] medications to keep things moving in my
[2:23:32] body and keep them functioning properly
[2:23:34] but I just said God even if I take these
[2:23:37] will you just take care of my body you
[2:23:39] know in the same way that I believe you
[2:23:41] are with the chemotherapy the first the
[2:23:46] first treatment left me it was very
[2:23:50] difficult on my body because of the
[2:23:51] lymphoma symptoms at the same time I
[2:23:53] missed the first three church services
[2:23:55] which were very difficult for me I hated
[2:23:58] to see the family go off and leave me at
[2:24:00] home but
[2:24:02] I just began to pray that the Lord would
[2:24:04] help me to be able to go to church and
[2:24:06] and that those were the only church
[2:24:10] services I missed the whole time I went
[2:24:12] through chemotherapy I made it to every
[2:24:14] single service after that sometimes I
[2:24:16] would be laying on the couch at two
[2:24:17] o'clock on a Wednesday evening and the
[2:24:20] kids that say mom you're gonna go to
[2:24:21] church and I'd say I'm sure gonna try my
[2:24:23] stomach is hurting so bad but I'm gonna
[2:24:24] try and but about three o'clock I'd feel
[2:24:27] a little better and I'd get up and get
[2:24:29] ready for church and heat a little
[2:24:31] something and I was able to go and I
[2:24:34] usually felt terrible while I was there
[2:24:36] but I it was such a lifeline for me and
[2:24:39] the things that would ministered
[2:24:42] wouldn't minister to me so deeply I
[2:24:44] didn't care who was around me but they
[2:24:47] administered that God is God is bigger
[2:24:50] and that you can speak to your Mountain
[2:24:52] I would stand up and I'd showed that's
[2:24:55] me Lord
[2:24:56] but I felt it so deeply because I'm his
[2:25:00] child and these things that were being
[2:25:02] preached applied to me in my situation
[2:25:03] and I knew it and I claimed it from my
[2:25:06] own and I knew that God was moving in my
[2:25:09] life and even though I had many doubts
[2:25:13] and many fears and may thoughts pass
[2:25:15] through my head you're not gonna make it
[2:25:17] to your 41st birthday you know and you
[2:25:20] got cancer for your 40th birthday and
[2:25:21] you're not gonna make it I had thoughts
[2:25:23] upon thoughts and that changed nothing
[2:25:25] I'd say Satan you are a liar
[2:25:27] those are your thoughts I believe the
[2:25:29] Word of God and I didn't always feel
[2:25:32] spiritual I didn't sometimes the text
[2:25:34] would come through and somebody would
[2:25:35] give me a scripture and I'd read it and
[2:25:37] I just put it down I couldn't even
[2:25:38] digest it and later on I'd go back and
[2:25:41] read it and say yes Lord that is true
[2:25:43] and it would encourage me the people in
[2:25:45] the church would send me cards with
[2:25:47] scriptures in them I would lay on the
[2:25:49] couch and just have them on the table
[2:25:50] and read them over and over till I had
[2:25:52] to memorize and the text that came
[2:25:55] through
[2:25:55] sometimes it was supernatural the things
[2:25:58] that it said would be exactly what I've
[2:26:00] been dealing with and so how can you
[2:26:02] doubt a God who speaks to you like that
[2:26:04] and he was so present in your worst
[2:26:08] [Music]
[2:26:18] gradually it got to the place I got
[2:26:22] through that first treatment it was very
[2:26:25] difficult but by the second treatment
[2:26:30] brother Tim our pastor sent a text to
[2:26:34] david and i and it was a scripture
[2:26:37] second chronicles 20 verse 15
[2:26:41] and in it says the battle is yours but
[2:26:43] gods
[2:26:44] and I thought about that and I thought
[2:26:47] how can the battle be his if I'm the one
[2:26:49] fighting I'm the one who's down here
[2:26:52] just working away at overcoming this
[2:26:54] thing and getting through this how can
[2:26:56] this battle be God but I saw in the Old
[2:26:59] Testament where the Israelites dealt in
[2:27:04] a physical realm things that we deal
[2:27:05] with in a spiritual realm and I saw how
[2:27:08] they just had to call on God and say
[2:27:10] look what they're saying about us look
[2:27:11] with the enemy feet about us and he'd
[2:27:13] say go to sleep I've got this don't
[2:27:15] worry about it and the next morning they
[2:27:16] get up and their enemy was dead like
[2:27:18] they just all be dead on the ground and
[2:27:20] I thought God if you'd do that for them
[2:27:23] you do that sort of thing today because
[2:27:25] you'd never change the word says you
[2:27:27] never change
[2:27:27] and so I said God I'm looking to you to
[2:27:32] fight my battle well that evening I got
[2:27:35] a card from a sister in our church Mary
[2:27:37] Katherine she had told me when I first
[2:27:39] got fixed she said I will be sending new
[2:27:41] cards regularly with scriptures and
[2:27:43] written encouragement in them and that
[2:27:45] evening she sent me I received a card
[2:27:48] and it had the exact same scripture
[2:27:51] second chronicles 20 verse 15 the battle
[2:27:53] isn't yours but gods and she wrote
[2:27:56] declare war on the devil no no retreat
[2:27:58] and I
[2:28:00] you're telling me that you're gonna
[2:28:01] fight my battle and I don't know how
[2:28:03] you're gonna do it I don't understand
[2:28:05] because I feel like right now I'm the
[2:28:06] one who's going through all this stuff
[2:28:07] but if you tell me you're gonna fight my
[2:28:09] battle I believe you have something
[2:28:11] supernatural for me and from that moment
[2:28:14] on I didn't just believe for a healing I
[2:28:16] started to believe for something over
[2:28:18] and above something miraculous and the
[2:28:21] only thing that I could think of that
[2:28:23] would be him taking on my battle it was
[2:28:25] for him to take away the chemotherapy
[2:28:27] completely and I thought the only way
[2:28:30] that that's gonna happen would be for me
[2:28:31] to get a clear PET scan and I said god I
[2:28:34] don't want to put you in a box perhaps
[2:28:36] there's other another way you could do
[2:28:38] it because you're that kind of God you
[2:28:39] can come up with something but I knew
[2:28:42] that after four treatments I would have
[2:28:43] a PET scan and then I'd have no more PET
[2:28:46] scans until after
[2:28:49] twelve treatments are complete so maybe
[2:28:52] you have something else for me but all I
[2:28:53] know is I'm believing for something
[2:28:55] supernatural and that you're taking on
[2:28:56] my battle
[2:28:59] meanwhile I I started my second
[2:29:03] treatment and I began to lose my hair
[2:29:04] the doctor told me that by the third
[2:29:07] treatment I would have no hair left
[2:29:09] and so right before church on a
[2:29:12] Wednesday night I was brushing my hair
[2:29:13] and the first the hair brush came out
[2:29:16] full of hair and I just looked at that I
[2:29:19] took a picture of it I said this is
[2:29:21] gonna mean something to me like this is
[2:29:24] the beginning of something you know that
[2:29:26] I've never had to deal with before and I
[2:29:29] looked at it it would seem very surreal
[2:29:31] I already had this aversion to food and
[2:29:33] all of a sudden this was turning my
[2:29:36] stomach to be losing this kind of hair
[2:29:38] and I just got her to look at it
[2:29:40] hereand this and melon rudder so every
[2:29:44] time I brush my hair after that it would
[2:29:45] fall out
[2:29:46] I would braid it and I touch up here and
[2:29:49] it would all just come loose and it
[2:29:50] would be stuck in the braid but would
[2:29:52] just be loose I couldn't even keep my
[2:29:53] hair tidy during that time and so for
[2:29:56] the next week and a half my hair was
[2:29:58] just falling out constantly
[2:29:59] it became bald in the front and in the
[2:30:01] back first and so I started to wear a
[2:30:03] headband around it just to get me
[2:30:06] through and I'd have it just braided in
[2:30:08] the back loosely mom and I actually had
[2:30:11] a very funny moment one night I was
[2:30:14] getting ready we were about to go to bed
[2:30:16] but we were talking for a minute and I
[2:30:18] was sitting in the living room and I
[2:30:19] sneezed and my head just fell forward
[2:30:22] and we just laughed we said don't sneeze
[2:30:24] to her the whole braid is gonna fly off
[2:30:26] you know so we just giggle a little bit
[2:30:29] about that and then we thought this is
[2:30:30] really sick that we're fighting us the
[2:30:32] Solis but amusing but we did anyway one
[2:30:38] morning during this time I got up and
[2:30:40] written on the chalkboard was a
[2:30:42] scripture of debt every hair on your
[2:30:44] head is numbered
[2:30:45] my husband had written that his
[2:30:47] encouragement to me he stood by my side
[2:30:51] in all of this I told the Lord but I was
[2:30:56] going through this I said would I come
[2:30:58] out will you help me to be the best
[2:31:03] waves that I can be because of the way
[2:31:05] that he stood by my side and it all
[2:31:07] backrubs many times a day when my back
[2:31:10] would ache so bad from the chemotherapy
[2:31:11] he waited on the end in foot and he
[2:31:15] wrote scriptures on the chalkboard to
[2:31:17] encourage me that he'd read that morning
[2:31:19] when he got up to go to work and I
[2:31:23] believed that every hair on my head if
[2:31:26] the deed number I knew that
[2:31:28] [Music]
[2:31:35] [Laughter]
[2:31:37] thankfully my treatments were actually
[2:31:40] better than what most people experience
[2:31:42] they were horrific every day was a
[2:31:46] battle and every day was different the
[2:31:50] way chemotherapy cycles work as you deal
[2:31:52] with different symptoms at different
[2:31:53] times in your cycle and so you never
[2:31:57] knew what was ahead of you although you
[2:31:58] did recognize a bit of a pattern and
[2:32:00] after you'd had a couple of cycles of
[2:32:02] chemotherapy I was in the process of
[2:32:07] losing my hair it took about a week and
[2:32:09] a half for most of it to come out I I
[2:32:13] was avoiding washing it for a while
[2:32:16] because my scalp hurt a lot and because
[2:32:19] I knew that it was going to make a huge
[2:32:20] mess when I wash it because I knew a lot
[2:32:22] was gonna come out but finally I'd had
[2:32:25] enough and I washed it one day on a
[2:32:26] Thursday and when I was done I began to
[2:32:29] brush it and most of the remaining hair
[2:32:32] came all out in the next 30 minutes and
[2:32:35] it was a horrific process to really
[2:32:40] realize the finality of it I did not
[2:32:42] recognize myself in the mirror because
[2:32:44] there were strands still hanging down
[2:32:46] just at the back I looked like something
[2:32:47] out of a horror movie and it was a
[2:32:51] definitely a difficult process but I
[2:32:54] made a decision to ask one of the ladies
[2:32:56] in our church to come shave my head my
[2:32:58] scalp was quite tender at this time and
[2:33:01] she came over it saved mom and David
[2:33:04] emotional
[2:33:06] situation of having to be the ones to do
[2:33:09] it so the sister came over because she
[2:33:12] had done it once before to another for
[2:33:14] another that you had cancer and so I had
[2:33:22] a piece of my heart but my body hadn't
[2:33:25] quite caught up with me and I sweated
[2:33:27] the whole time I was having my head
[2:33:29] shaved soaked through the entire set of
[2:33:31] clothes she prayed before we did it and
[2:33:35] it was a beautiful prayer and very
[2:33:37] comforting and then she shaved my head
[2:33:39] while my mom cleaned the hair up off the
[2:33:41] floor and we cried together and it was
[2:33:44] over another short while and then I felt
[2:33:47] so much better it was behind me I felt
[2:33:49] clean bald head is better than a few
[2:33:52] strands let me tell you it's a lot less
[2:33:54] frightening I felt clean and good and I
[2:33:57] felt like I could move on so I began to
[2:33:59] wear hats I bought several different
[2:34:02] colors and things to go with my
[2:34:03] different outfits and I knew that God
[2:34:06] would restore my hair so as the days
[2:34:10] went on and I dealt with the things that
[2:34:11] you deal with in chemotherapy there's
[2:34:14] not a part of your body that doesn't
[2:34:16] ache itch hurt tingle burn there is
[2:34:22] literally not one part of my body that
[2:34:24] in some way was not affected by the
[2:34:25] chemotherapy or the lymphoma and so each
[2:34:30] day
[2:34:31] came down two hours and sometimes
[2:34:33] minutes to just get through that working
[2:34:35] to try to get through my food trying not
[2:34:39] to look too miserable I had stomach
[2:34:40] pains that were kind of unique to this
[2:34:43] kind of chemotherapy and the doctor did
[2:34:45] try different things with it
[2:34:46] but sometimes only certain positions
[2:34:49] would relieve the pain a little bit
[2:34:51] so as funny as it sounds coming at this
[2:34:55] time one of my kids would walk by my
[2:34:58] room and I'd be crawling around on the
[2:34:59] floor and they're like mom are you okay
[2:35:02] and I'm like just pray for mommy and I'm
[2:35:04] sure it had to be very frightening for
[2:35:06] them to see me act so strangely you know
[2:35:09] and there were a few nights I literally
[2:35:12] slept in a recliner upside down with my
[2:35:14] legs up the back of my my head and the
[2:35:16] foot of the recliner because it was the
[2:35:17] only position I could get comfortable in
[2:35:19] until all the blood drained in my head
[2:35:21] and then I had to change position but
[2:35:24] there was all sorts of non dignifying
[2:35:29] things that take place during
[2:35:31] chemotherapy and thankfully the Lord was
[2:35:34] with me oh and I would tell him about my
[2:35:37] symptoms over and over again I would say
[2:35:39] God I can't do anything about my lid
[2:35:41] long but you're my healer I can't do
[2:35:43] anything about neuropathy but you are my
[2:35:45] healer and I'd say I'm sorry if I'm
[2:35:47] repeating this too much but it makes me
[2:35:49] feel better to tell you about it and
[2:35:51] that way I won't have to overburden my
[2:35:53] husband with it and worry him more and
[2:35:55] he listened I knew he did and I felt
[2:35:58] this pleasure when I would trust him
[2:36:00] with the things I was going for I would
[2:36:03] feel him draw close and I told my dad
[2:36:05] who is not a Christian I said dad that
[2:36:08] you an angel is so close sometimes I can
[2:36:10] touch it I can almost touch him that's
[2:36:13] how much I believed that he was there
[2:36:15] but it did not make the situation easy
[2:36:17] it did not keep thoughts from coming in
[2:36:21] my mind lest anybody think that I'm
[2:36:23] super-spiritual or anything somebody
[2:36:25] said to me oh you'll make it through
[2:36:27] you're strong and I thought you have no
[2:36:29] idea I'm this weak as a kitten right now
[2:36:32] I feel like I couldn't I feel it's a
[2:36:35] weak as a kitten but God said he would
[2:36:36] be strong when I'm weak and that's what
[2:36:39] I was depending on anyway I told people
[2:36:42] I said this is Micah live I'm picking up
[2:36:44] stones and I'm about to cut his head off
[2:36:46] they're just something began to rise up
[2:36:49] in me and the more I fed it the more it
[2:36:51] rose up and the more pulsated and came
[2:36:53] out and it wasn't just me there was a
[2:36:55] whole church behind me growling around
[2:36:57] me they'd had people say to me I have my
[2:37:00] doubts too and then the Lord said this
[2:37:02] to me or show me this or this song came
[2:37:04] to me and I say I know it we're in it
[2:37:06] together and we're believing together
[2:37:07] and God is going to work one day my mom
[2:37:11] was working in the kitchen and I came
[2:37:13] into the living room to get something
[2:37:14] and she was there and I started to walk
[2:37:17] back to my bedroom and I turned around
[2:37:20] and I said mom I said I believe God is
[2:37:24] working in my situation I was thinking
[2:37:27] about that scripture brother Tim had
[2:37:28] sent about the battle and Mary Katherine
[2:37:30] had sent about the battle is the Lord's
[2:37:32] I said I believe God is working in my
[2:37:34] situation she said I do too I said no I
[2:37:36] mean something supernatural I believe
[2:37:39] God is gonna do something supernatural
[2:37:40] and tears came to her eyes and she said
[2:37:42] I do too we would share scriptures all
[2:37:45] of us would share scriptures the kids
[2:37:47] would write things on the board devil
[2:37:48] how a liar you are weed right yes that
[2:37:50] amen and things like that and we'd feed
[2:37:53] on that and I had cards from the church
[2:37:56] all strung across our fireplace and I'd
[2:37:58] stop and read them during the day and it
[2:38:01] would encourage my hurt all over again
[2:38:03] the church was bringing food by and
[2:38:05] doing many things to help me they had a
[2:38:08] food train we actually had a humorous
[2:38:11] moment one day when we looked at the
[2:38:12] chalkboard and it said appetizers it was
[2:38:15] a little chart and said appetizers and
[2:38:16] main courses and it said soup soup soup
[2:38:19] soup soup soup soup soup which delaney
[2:38:22] or eleven-year-old had written on there
[2:38:23] and that week we'd had a lot of serve
[2:38:25] podcasts
[2:38:26] we all kind of giggled at that we had
[2:38:30] some funny moments it wasn't all just
[2:38:32] heaviness after I lost my hair I well
[2:38:38] always on Sundays I'll start getting
[2:38:40] ready for church and inevitably about
[2:38:42] the time I close my bedroom door there's
[2:38:43] gonna be a knock from one of our five
[2:38:45] children and so I thought one day I
[2:38:47] thought I'm gonna get them so I shut the
[2:38:50] door and sure enough a minute later
[2:38:51] there was a knock on the door I said
[2:38:54] come in unbold
[2:38:55] and there's this pause and silence and
[2:38:59] then a little boy said oh that's okay
[2:39:01] and I was like oh didn't work you know
[2:39:03] but but we did get a laugh out of that
[2:39:05] and I did have a few ball jokes that I
[2:39:08] was allowed to say but the kids and
[2:39:11] David were not
[2:39:12] [Music]
[2:39:22] in thinking about um God fighting my
[2:39:25] battle I began to realize my mom had to
[2:39:27] leave to go back to Canada on February
[2:39:29] 28th she works in the accounting
[2:39:32] business and it was gonna be the start
[2:39:34] of tax season and so as she was not
[2:39:36] going to be able to stay and I started
[2:39:38] thinking about this he was also getting
[2:39:41] closer to the time of my my PET scan
[2:39:44] which they do after four treatments it's
[2:39:47] a way of monitoring how well your body
[2:39:49] is responding to lymphoma to the
[2:39:51] treatments for lymphoma they may also
[2:39:54] use it to decide whether they're gonna
[2:39:56] do radiation or how much and so um it's
[2:40:00] just a way of checking your progress and
[2:40:02] after that they just continue the rest
[2:40:04] of your treatments no questions asked
[2:40:06] and do a PET scan finally after your 12
[2:40:08] treatments so it was approaching the
[2:40:11] time I'd had four treatments
[2:40:13] thankfully I had not that had the severe
[2:40:15] nausea and vomiting and things like that
[2:40:18] my fourth treatment I was going through
[2:40:21] a little Gethsemane not looking forward
[2:40:24] to it you know a couple of nights before
[2:40:27] that I thought I do not want to go
[2:40:29] through this next treatment I felt like
[2:40:31] I was still kind of recovering from the
[2:40:33] last one and and then I thought I don't
[2:40:36] have to accept it the fourth one's gonna
[2:40:38] be worse they told me they'll get
[2:40:40] progressively worse but I just thought
[2:40:42] I'm not going to sign up for that I'm
[2:40:43] gonna believe that this is going to be
[2:40:44] the best treatment and believe it or not
[2:40:47] it was it was my easiest one I can
[2:40:50] honestly say that so we went to church
[2:40:55] well to back up on Saturday February
[2:40:58] 17th I was getting ready for bed and my
[2:41:02] heart was so full of the goodness of God
[2:41:04] the things he'd done for me many of
[2:41:07] which that I've relayed to you and it
[2:41:10] was just overflowing and I was by myself
[2:41:12] and I thought God how can I ever thank
[2:41:15] you for your presence and all of this I
[2:41:17] know you're gonna do something
[2:41:19] supernatural for me but even beyond that
[2:41:22] just the way you've helped me and
[2:41:23] comforted me and sent things to me I
[2:41:25] know it's you and I know you're real and
[2:41:27] it just my heart was so full and I
[2:41:29] didn't know how to express it and I said
[2:41:32] how can I show people now while I'm sick
[2:41:34] I want to be able to show them how
[2:41:36] thankful I am to you and how grateful
[2:41:38] and that you're there for people when
[2:41:40] they go through a hard time I said I
[2:41:42] want to be able to express that somehow
[2:41:43] but I can't other than just in a text
[2:41:46] tell somebody God's healing my body and
[2:41:48] I believe his word or whatever so my
[2:41:51] heart was just very full in the next day
[2:41:53] February 18th we went to church and our
[2:41:57] pastor preached that God will do extreme
[2:41:59] things to get his people to believe and
[2:42:01] I knew I knew it was true I knew it was
[2:42:05] for me and my heart was so full what was

[2:45:54] [Music]
[2:46:00] to rise with him after service we were
[2:46:05] just worshipping and thanking God I had
[2:46:07] to sit in an isolated area of the church
[2:46:10] the mezzanine seating so that I wouldn't
[2:46:12] have to wear masks during that time a
[2:46:15] mask is very warm and I just was it
[2:46:21] prevented me from having to I could
[2:46:23] interact at a distance so I was sitting
[2:46:27] up in the mezzanine seating with my
[2:46:28] family and brother Tim was singing
[2:46:32] leading singing and he changed his song
[2:46:35] to leaning on the everlasting arms and
[2:46:37] something welled up in me my heart was
[2:46:41] already so full and it just welled up
[2:46:43] that that's what I've been doing it's
[2:46:44] leaning on the everlasting arms and what
[2:46:47] a fellowship and enjoy divine and
[2:46:50] overwhelming to my heart and a little
[2:46:53] boys petite step out a busy I didn't
[2:46:56] know what I was gonna do and that Joey
[2:47:04] to come and go around the church there
[2:47:10] was such a determination people say my
[2:47:13] vote in my face was almost fiercely that
[2:47:16] I was so determined to serve God and to
[2:47:19] show the devil
[2:47:22] [Applause]
[2:47:22] [Music]
[2:47:27] [Applause]
[2:47:32] [Applause]
[2:47:33] [Music]
[2:47:38] [Applause]
[2:47:39] [Music]
[2:47:49] what you don't see on the video is the
[2:47:52] real atmosphere that was there you don't
[2:47:55] see the responses people started to
[2:47:57] rejoice with me after as they started to
[2:48:00] see what was going on there was a whole
[2:48:03] atmosphere there that you can sense some
[2:48:05] of it but not nearly like it was there
[2:48:07] and even after it was all over the
[2:48:10] worship that came out of my mouth as
[2:48:12] they dismiss people it was just flowing
[2:48:15] out of me such an expression of
[2:48:18] beautiful words that were just coming
[2:48:19] out of me and thanks to God for all that
[2:48:22] he was doing in my life
[2:48:23] [Music]
[2:49:43] so many things had improved but I still
[2:49:48] have many symptoms my my lung still felt
[2:49:50] like it was me to bled but I was not
[2:49:53] looking at that I said God you're my
[2:49:54] healer I don't know what you have in
[2:49:56] store for me I did not know even what
[2:49:59] the results of the PET scan would be but
[2:50:01] I just believed that God was in control
[2:50:02] and that he had something supernatural
[2:50:04] and I felt like this could be it because
[2:50:06] Mom was about to leave it just all lined
[2:50:08] up and because I believed I just
[2:50:10] believed God was moving
[2:50:11] so why not now I guess maybe was what I
[2:50:14] was thinking so I was I went into that
[2:50:17] PET scan and trying to read you know the
[2:50:20] lady who does the PET scan you're trying
[2:50:22] to read her reaction and she just acted
[2:50:24] the same as she went in when she came
[2:50:25] out I guess you're ready for your burger
[2:50:27] she said you know because you can't eat
[2:50:28] before PET scan and I couldn't read
[2:50:30] anything from her reaction so that was
[2:50:34] fine and I went home
[2:50:35] and the next day I met with my
[2:50:38] oncologist and David was with me and who
[2:50:42] went into the appointment and when he
[2:50:44] came into the room the doctor came in he
[2:50:46] said he was seen your skin and we said
[2:50:48] no he said um he said the cancer is gone
[2:50:51] he said the cancer is gone this is
[2:50:53] dramatic he said here come look
[2:50:55] community took us over to a computer and
[2:50:57] showed us a side-by-side to scan showing
[2:51:01] the mass of my lung that from the scan
[2:51:04] they taken two days after Christmas and
[2:51:08] then this was February the 19th skin and
[2:51:11] every spot of lymphoma every lymph node
[2:51:14] that was affected was totally clear the
[2:51:17] seventh centimeter tumor was totally
[2:51:20] clear from cancer the report was
[2:51:22] absolutely beautiful it was clear and he
[2:51:25] said this is dramatic and I thought yes
[2:51:28] because sometimes God is very dramatic
[2:51:31] [Applause]
[2:51:32] [Music]
[2:51:35] I just I thank God to this day that he
[2:51:39] spared me all those treatments I've been
[2:51:42] in contact with another woman who's
[2:51:45] going through this exact same regimen
[2:51:47] and the vomiting and the mafia that that
[2:51:50] poor lady is doing with I'm no special
[2:51:53] person I should have gone through that
[2:51:54] and yet God spared bats
[2:51:57] and every night before I go to bed I
[2:52:00] think in force very few
[2:52:03] because that was so very sick having
[2:52:05] some very tired of nothing
[2:52:07] and he gave me a special treatment just
[2:52:10] because I'm his child and because I
[2:52:13] believe him and that's something that he
[2:52:16] promises to anybody who will believe him
[2:52:18] I took him at his word and he butts
[2:52:21] right there to meet it and so
[2:52:25] the recovery actually has been rapid
[2:52:29] every day I've felt better and it was
[2:52:32] amazing how quickly my energy came back
[2:52:34] once the chemotherapy was over I
[2:52:38] wondered I wondered how long it would
[2:52:41] take for my lung to start expanding
[2:52:43] again and there's just been it's
[2:52:46] improved by leaps and bounds and all the
[2:52:50] chemotherapy
[2:52:52] side effects are totally gone you know I
[2:52:56] sometimes I'm going through my day doing
[2:52:59] the normal things of life and I can't
[2:53:00] believe that I feel normal and that I
[2:53:02] have food cravings that I'm hungry I
[2:53:06] haven't had not had that in almost two
[2:53:08] years a year and a half to two years I'd
[2:53:11] not felt in normal in many of these
[2:53:13] areas and I just thank God for his
[2:53:17] beauty and for His grace to me and I
[2:53:20] know that explains it to anybody else
