[1:04:59] and so appreciate you thank you amen if
[1:05:02] you'll turn with me to Revelation
[1:05:04] chapter 9 I'm going to I'm going to read
[1:05:08] from this book of symbols that is
[1:05:12] something that has uh been left for the
[1:05:14] end time
[1:05:17] prophesied um and written even after the
[1:05:21] Apostle Paul had left the scene and uh
[1:05:24] here John it's a revelation of the end
[1:05:27] time and what God would do in the end
[1:05:30] time and some of it most of it was
[1:05:32] written in in shrouded in symbols
[1:05:35] because God made it that way that it
[1:05:38] would not be made known until the
[1:05:40] evening light so these many things would
[1:05:43] be obscure and and clouded and darkened
[1:05:47] and and um
[1:05:49] being as as we say in dark words and
[1:05:52] symbolic forms or Shadows or um Jesus
[1:05:56] would many times speak in Parables that
[1:06:00] they wouldn't understand they wouldn't
[1:06:01] get the meaning of but he said it's
[1:06:03] given to you to know the mysteries of
[1:06:05] the kingdom and here we are in the last
[1:06:07] day to see the Fulfillment of the word
[1:06:10] of God and how precious it is to us
[1:06:13] Revelation 9 verse1 and the fifth angel
[1:06:16] sounded and I saw a star fall from
[1:06:19] Heaven unto the Earth and to him was
[1:06:22] given the key of the bottomless pit so
[1:06:26] here is the fall of of a of an Angel and
[1:06:31] to him was given a key or permission to
[1:06:35] open up the bottomless pit and he opened
[1:06:37] the bottomless pit and There Rose a
[1:06:40] smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a
[1:06:42] great furnace and the Sun and the air
[1:06:46] were darkened by the reason of the smoke
[1:06:49] of the pit so it brings a great darkness
[1:06:53] and there came out of the smoke focused
[1:06:56] upon the Earth and unto them were given
[1:06:58] power as the Scorpions of the Earth have
[1:07:00] power and it was commanded them that
[1:07:02] they should not hurt the grass of the
[1:07:04] earth neither any green thing neither
[1:07:07] any tree but only those men who have not
[1:07:11] the Seal of God in their foreheads and
[1:07:14] to them it was given that they should
[1:07:16] not kill them but they should be
[1:07:17] tormented five months and their torment
[1:07:20] was as the torment of a scorpion and
[1:07:22] when he striketh a man and in those days
[1:07:25] shall man seek death and shall not find
[1:07:27] it and shall desire to die and Death
[1:07:30] Shall flee from them and the shape of
[1:07:32] the Locust were liken the horses
[1:07:36] prepared un battle and on their heads
[1:07:39] were as it were crowns like gold and
[1:07:43] their faces were as faces of men and
[1:07:46] they had hair as the hair of women and
[1:07:49] their teeth were as teeth of lions and
[1:07:52] they had breastplates as it were
[1:07:54] breastplates of iron and the sound of
[1:07:57] their wings was as a sound of Chariots
[1:08:00] of many horses running to battle and
[1:08:04] they had tails liken to scorpions and
[1:08:07] there were stings in their tails and
[1:08:10] their power was to hurt in 5 months and
[1:08:13] they had a king over them which is the
[1:08:15] Angel of the bottomless pit whose name
[1:08:19] in the Hebrew tongue is aaden but in the
[1:08:23] Greek tongue his name is apolon
[1:08:26] one woe is passed behold there come two
[1:08:29] woes more Hereafter and the sixth Angels
[1:08:33] sounded and I Heard a Voice from the
[1:08:36] horns of the golden altar which is
[1:08:39] before God saying to the sixth Angels
[1:08:43] which had the trumpet loose the Four
[1:08:45] Angels which are bound in the great
[1:08:47] river Euphrates and the Four Angels were
[1:08:51] loosed which were prepared for an hour
[1:08:54] and a day and and a month and a year for
[1:08:57] to slay the third part of men and the
[1:09:00] number of the army of the horsemen were
[1:09:03] 200,000,000 and I heard the number of
[1:09:06] them and thus I saw the horses in the
[1:09:10] vision and them that sat on them having
[1:09:12] breastplates of fire and Jason and
[1:09:15] brimstone and the heads of the horses
[1:09:18] were as the heads of lions and out of
[1:09:21] their mouths issued fire and smoke and
[1:09:24] brimstone by these men or by these three
[1:09:27] were was the third part of men killed by
[1:09:31] the fire by the Smoke by the brimstone
[1:09:34] which issued out of their mouths for
[1:09:37] their power is in their mouth and in
[1:09:40] their tails for their tails were likened
[1:09:42] to serpents and had heads and with them
[1:09:45] they do hurt and the rest of the men
[1:09:48] which were not killed by these plagues
[1:09:51] yet repented not of the works of their
[1:09:54] hands that they should not worship
[1:09:56] devils and Idols of gold and silver and
[1:09:59] brass and stone and of wood which
[1:10:02] neither can see nor hear nor walk
[1:10:06] neither repented they of their murders
[1:10:09] nor of their sorceries nor of their
[1:10:12] fornication nor of their thefts and I
[1:10:16] saw another Mighty Angel come down from
[1:10:20] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:10:22] rainbow was upon his head and his his
[1:10:25] face was as it were the Sun and his feet
[1:10:28] as pillars of fire and he had in his
[1:10:31] hand a little book open and he set his
[1:10:34] right foot upon the sea and his left
[1:10:36] foot upon on the earth and cried with a
[1:10:39] loud voice as when a lion Roth and when
[1:10:42] he had cried seven Thunders uttered
[1:10:45] their voices amen may God bless you can
[1:10:48] you can be
[1:10:49] seated today I'm going to be speaking
[1:10:52] onto you about our faith
[1:10:56] our
[1:10:57] vision and here we have read of a vision
[1:11:02] of the end
[1:11:03] time and in this we see the coming of
[1:11:07] two
[1:11:08] angels that are that come into this
[1:11:12] Dimension and uh in in Revelation 11 or
[1:11:16] chapter 9 and 11 they had a one of them
[1:11:20] had a king over them this great host of
[1:11:23] demonic Powers had a King over them
[1:11:26] which is the Angel of the bottomless pit
[1:11:29] whose name in the Hebrew tongue is aaden
[1:11:31] but in the Greek tongue his name is
[1:11:33] aolon and from his Abyss that he is a
[1:11:36] king over comes a blinding
[1:11:40] delusion a smoke that permeates
[1:11:44] everything and it permeates every crack
[1:11:47] every crevice of humanity and every
[1:11:50] fabric of
[1:11:52] society and it comes to Cloud the vision
[1:11:54] for to keep men from seeing the light of
[1:11:58] truth if you notice it it this smoke
[1:12:01] would would blind or or darken the Sun
[1:12:05] and block out the light but then we see
[1:12:08] um also coming after that or in the same
[1:12:13] time period of a um in Revelation 10:1
[1:12:18] the coming of the mighty Angel and only
[1:12:21] Christ this could be he is the light for
[1:12:24] his face is as it were the son he is the
[1:12:27] Angel of the Covenant for he is clothed
[1:12:30] with a rainbow he comes um as the light
[1:12:34] for his face is as it were the Sun and
[1:12:38] he comes with truth for as he shouts are
[1:12:42] the Bible uses the word Christ there are
[1:12:45] voices of Thunders that are heard
[1:12:47] mysteries of God which will re which
[1:12:51] will reveal and open up the contents of
[1:12:54] the book and of course every human being
[1:12:58] today is influenced by one of these
[1:13:03] angels either the Destroyer the king of
[1:13:06] the Abyss which is Lord over your life
[1:13:09] or the mighty Angel which is Christ the
[1:13:13] lord and this Mighty angel of course we
[1:13:16] see him holding back the powers of
[1:13:19] Darkness there is his feet is upon the
[1:13:23] land and upon the sea from where in
[1:13:26] Revelation 13 if we would read that it
[1:13:29] would tell us of a great Beast that rose
[1:13:32] out of the sea and another rose out of
[1:13:34] the land and so here in Revelation 10 it
[1:13:38] shows that he has his feet which means
[1:13:42] possession holding down the very powers
[1:13:45] of hell and these beasts that are rising
[1:13:48] up that are that are to be spirits in
[1:13:52] the end time that brings about the um
[1:13:56] the mark of the beast and the end time
[1:13:59] process and so he he comes there to
[1:14:03] deceive those whose names are written
[1:14:07] are not written in the Book of Life
[1:14:10] notice this those those names that are
[1:14:12] written in the Lamb's Book of Life they
[1:14:15] are taken from the earth they are in a
[1:14:18] great planned Escape because you see
[1:14:23] Jesus said we we should always pray pray
[1:14:26] always to escape the things that are
[1:14:28] coming on this Earth and to be accounted
[1:14:31] worthy to stand before the son of man so
[1:14:35] you see it is a plan Escape that God has
[1:14:39] a Rapture of his church where Christ
[1:14:42] will take his bride amen where he will
[1:14:45] rescue her from the powers of Darkness
[1:14:49] as hell will establish itself upon the
[1:14:51] Earth and Satan will be given a short SE
[1:14:55] season of complete Dominion you will see
[1:14:58] this in Revelation 12 again we couldn't
[1:15:01] read all of this in our open and reading
[1:15:04] but the the study of all of this was
[1:15:06] show even Revelation 12 and 12 of the
[1:15:09] response when the saints are are been
[1:15:12] gathered into heaven it says therefore
[1:15:14] Rejoice your heavens and you that dwell
[1:15:16] in them and woe to the inhabiters of the
[1:15:19] earth and of the sea for the Devil is
[1:15:22] come down to you having great Wrath
[1:15:25] because he knoweth he hath but a short
[1:15:27] time so you see those who will miss the
[1:15:31] Rapture those who are Sanctified but not
[1:15:34] spirit filled they they will go through
[1:15:37] the Great Tribulation they will they
[1:15:39] will be left behind when the Rapture
[1:15:41] takes place because the Rapture is only
[1:15:44] for those who have the token that is the
[1:15:47] literal life of Jesus Christ the holy
[1:15:50] spirit amen now and of course you can
[1:15:52] see this again it's it's spelled out in
[1:15:55] the Bible what will happen in Revelation
[1:15:57] 12:17 said the dragon was wro with the
[1:16:01] woman and went to make war with the
[1:16:03] remnant of her seed which keep the
[1:16:05] Commandments of God and have the
[1:16:06] testimony of Jesus Christ so these are
[1:16:09] people who have a testimony of Jesus
[1:16:11] Christ and he goes to make war with them
[1:16:14] and and of course he will overcome them
[1:16:17] because the Bible said in Revelation 13
[1:16:19] and verse 7 it was given power unto him
[1:16:22] to make war with the Saints and to to
[1:16:25] overcome them and power was given un him
[1:16:27] over all kindreds and tongues and
[1:16:29] Nations and all that dwell upon the
[1:16:32] Earth shall worship Him whose names are
[1:16:34] not written in the Book of Life of the
[1:16:36] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[1:16:39] world so here again we we see Bible
[1:16:43] prophecy coming down of of um of of
[1:16:47] great things as God delivers his people
[1:16:51] the bride and he also will deliver his
[1:16:54] people isra Israel there's
[1:16:56] 144,000 elect that will not be deceived
[1:17:00] and that will
[1:17:02] will once again recognize him them him
[1:17:06] whom they have pierced and the Bible
[1:17:09] tells you in Revelation
[1:17:10] 123 of this preparation for he said when
[1:17:14] the dragon saw he was he was cast in the
[1:17:18] earth he persecuted the woman Israel
[1:17:21] which had brought forth the Manchild
[1:17:23] Jesus Christ and to the woman was given
[1:17:26] two wings of a great Eagle we can see
[1:17:29] this in the Bible in Revelation 11 there
[1:17:31] were two witnesses given which which
[1:17:35] represents Elijah and Moses the law and
[1:17:38] the prophets and in other words a
[1:17:41] complete word of God for the Jewish
[1:17:43] people and and here they will come and
[1:17:46] reveal to them their Messiah and so
[1:17:48] they're given two wings of a great Eagle
[1:17:50] that she might fly into the Wilderness
[1:17:53] into replace where she is nourished for
[1:17:56] a time and a times and a half times as a
[1:17:59] time one year times two years and a half
[1:18:02] times three and a half years from the
[1:18:03] face of the
[1:18:05] serpent so God has a provision sir he
[1:18:09] has a provision for us that's an
[1:18:13] escape amen he has a
[1:18:16] provision for even the foolish virgins
[1:18:18] who will give their life in the
[1:18:20] tribulation will wind up at the white
[1:18:21] Throne judgment and be judged according
[1:18:23] to the Deeds Done in their body
[1:18:25] he has a provision for the Jewish people
[1:18:28] and so you see for them he will send the
[1:18:33] you know again give to her the wings of
[1:18:36] an of of an eagle two wings of a great
[1:18:39] Eagle to fly into her place where she
[1:18:44] will be cared for or nourished and
[1:18:47] protected and given and and given life
[1:18:51] we will see her in she'll be part of the
[1:18:54] Great
[1:18:55] Millennial Reign ahead as the servants
[1:18:58] to the bride of Christ but now when we
[1:19:01] look at at the land of Israel we see a
[1:19:04] nation that has been attacked on every
[1:19:08] side and all of this is in the vision
[1:19:12] now this this is what I'm trying to
[1:19:14] focus on today is the vision and then
[1:19:17] our faith as we as we see our faith is
[1:19:22] the it gives us the ability to to see
[1:19:25] the vision as the vision is manifested
[1:19:30] so you if you look there in the land of
[1:19:32] Israel and what is even happening today
[1:19:35] it's all in the vision the Bible said in
[1:19:38] Zechariah 12:1 the burden of the word of
[1:19:41] the Lord for Israel sayeth the Lord
[1:19:43] which stretches forth the heavens and
[1:19:46] layeth the foundation of the earth and
[1:19:48] forth the spirit of man within him
[1:19:50] behold I will make Jerusalem a cup of
[1:19:53] trembling into all people round about
[1:19:56] when they shall be in the seeds both
[1:19:58] against Judah that's the Jews and
[1:20:00] against Jerusalem and in that day I will
[1:20:04] make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for
[1:20:08] all
[1:20:10] people and all that burden themselves
[1:20:13] with it shall be cut in pieces though
[1:20:16] all the people of the earth be gathered
[1:20:18] together against it so this is what the
[1:20:21] vision says the vision says Israel will
[1:20:25] be the burdensome Stone of all the
[1:20:30] nations amen now this is a spiritual
[1:20:34] battle and it is
[1:20:36] War I want you to understand that and
[1:20:39] the Warfare even with with Israel is
[1:20:42] more than a natural battle it is a
[1:20:45] spiritual
[1:20:47] battle and and the Warfare is on every
[1:20:50] side it comes from Iran from Hezbollah
[1:20:53] from Hamas the pales iians from all the
[1:20:56] Arab Nations and and and in our country
[1:20:59] as well where public sentiment is
[1:21:02] against them and riots have been in the
[1:21:04] streets and here in the United States
[1:21:07] the world opinion is against Israel
[1:21:11] Israel is being attacked as though they
[1:21:13] were the aggressors they there's so many
[1:21:16] of fronts with this war even with the
[1:21:19] turmoil uh within the Israeli Israeli
[1:21:23] people they're rioting in the streets
[1:21:25] they're screaming to free the hostages
[1:21:29] as if Israel is the one that can do this
[1:21:32] you see Israel doesn't have the
[1:21:37] hostages amen they don't have the
[1:21:39] hostages their their governor is not one
[1:21:42] to holding them a hostage it is the
[1:21:44] enemy out here and they're writing
[1:21:47] against their own government because
[1:21:49] they're so blinded against or by the
[1:21:53] smoke of the ill
[1:21:55] usion and and remember you can watch
[1:21:58] Israel and watch he is physically and
[1:22:02] realize that we are her
[1:22:05] counterpart so then therefore you know
[1:22:09] whatever she is naturally we are
[1:22:13] spiritually actually when you read the
[1:22:16] scripture in Joel chapter 2 it is
[1:22:18] speaking of about Israel naturally when
[1:22:21] he says I will restore unto you all the
[1:22:24] years of the cankerworm the borm the cus
[1:22:27] and the caterpillar but you see it was
[1:22:29] Peter on the day of Pentecost that took
[1:22:31] and applied that spiritually and said
[1:22:34] this is that because he could see the
[1:22:37] spiritual application of what what was a
[1:22:41] natural
[1:22:43] promise amen now so again again it was
[1:22:47] it spoken to Israel as a nation but to
[1:22:49] the bride also because she is spiritual
[1:22:52] Israel we are her spiritual
[1:22:55] counterpart and she has been gathered
[1:22:57] from the Nations back to her Homeland
[1:23:02] and even so God is gathering his bride
[1:23:06] from the
[1:23:08] denominations back to the homeland of
[1:23:10] the
[1:23:11] Bible this is what God is doing now in
[1:23:15] the midst of all of this there is the
[1:23:18] mystery of iniquity that is at work now
[1:23:22] remember God has his mystery
[1:23:25] and and Satan also is coming under his
[1:23:27] guys and and and here under his cover of
[1:23:31] smoke in darkness here he's working you
[1:23:34] know working among the the people in the
[1:23:38] world today and then the book of
[1:23:40] Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse one
[1:23:44] Paul would talk about the coming of the
[1:23:46] Lord and he said we beseech you brother
[1:23:48] by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:50] by gathering together to him that you be
[1:23:52] soon not shaken or betrayed troubled
[1:23:55] neither by Spirit nor by word nor by
[1:23:57] letter as from us as the day of Christ
[1:24:00] is at hand let no man deceive you by any
[1:24:05] means for that day shall not come except
[1:24:10] there come a falling away
[1:24:14] first and that man of sin be revealed
[1:24:17] the son of predition that's right amen
[1:24:20] so notice Paul has this Vision this is
[1:24:24] his
[1:24:25] insight and they were looking for the
[1:24:27] come of the Lord and Paul said now
[1:24:29] listen don't be shaken by what they're
[1:24:31] saying for the coming cannot happen
[1:24:35] until there's a fallen away
[1:24:38] first so they were looking and expecting
[1:24:41] the Lord Jesus they had seen him go away
[1:24:43] he had said I'm coming again in like
[1:24:45] manner the as you have seen me go away I
[1:24:48] will come again they had watched him
[1:24:50] depart and clouds received him out of
[1:24:53] their sight and so you know they were
[1:24:55] looking for his return and and and and
[1:24:58] there were even things that they were
[1:25:01] saying you know ideas among the people
[1:25:05] of that for example because that Jesus
[1:25:09] had said about John you know um uh and
[1:25:13] Peter cuz he he spoke to Peter and said
[1:25:16] you know one day he said when you're
[1:25:18] when you're old they're going to lead
[1:25:20] you to places that you don't want to go
[1:25:22] you're this is the way you're going to
[1:25:24] die and he and he said well what what
[1:25:26] have come of this man and he spoke unto
[1:25:29] about John and he said it's it's not for
[1:25:31] you to know that what did what if what
[1:25:35] would it be what what would it be if he
[1:25:37] just lived till I come so there went for
[1:25:40] the
[1:25:41] saying that went forth the saying ah
[1:25:44] John's still here that's right so we
[1:25:48] know then if John's still here the Lord
[1:25:52] is still coming he hadn't come
[1:25:55] yet and so there went abroad this saying
[1:25:58] but as John corrected it he said he said
[1:26:01] he didn't say I would be here when he
[1:26:03] come he said what is it to the if I live
[1:26:07] till he comes that's right so John tried
[1:26:09] to correct those sayings you know but
[1:26:12] people were anxious about to come to the
[1:26:14] Lord and I think as as we come toward
[1:26:18] the end the more anxious we get that's
[1:26:22] right you know we we're wanting to see
[1:26:24] we want to pry back the curtain as it
[1:26:27] was or you know take a peek into the
[1:26:30] future you know uh some understand what
[1:26:33] is about to
[1:26:35] happen what is going to take place and
[1:26:39] and so you know again we we want today
[1:26:42] to to look into the vision of God's word
[1:26:47] and try to get an understanding now when
[1:26:50] Paul Paul knew of course the church
[1:26:53] would have first before his coming he
[1:26:55] said now according to my vision
[1:26:58] according to what God showed me are you
[1:27:01] with me the vision uh he's
[1:27:05] going he's not coming back until there's
[1:27:08] a big falling
[1:27:10] away and and then in verse five he said
[1:27:13] remember ye not when I was yet with you
[1:27:16] I told you these things so there were
[1:27:20] things he was telling them you know
[1:27:23] maybe even things that aren't even
[1:27:25] recorded in the scripture that he had
[1:27:27] told them before but he had told them
[1:27:29] been talking to them and he said I told
[1:27:32] you these things and and of course he
[1:27:34] did to the Corinthians in 2 Corinthians
[1:27:37] 11:1 he says I'm jealous over
[1:27:40] you with a Godly jealousy for I've
[1:27:44] espoused you to one husband that I may
[1:27:47] present you as a Chase virgin to Christ
[1:27:52] but I fear what I'm afraid of lest by
[1:27:55] any means and he looks back at the
[1:27:58] prophecy he looks back at what happened
[1:28:01] in Eden and he says as a serpent begal
[1:28:04] leave through his subtlety so your mind
[1:28:07] should be corrupted from the Simplicity
[1:28:09] that is in Christ so you see he sees her
[1:28:13] and he's afraid she is going to give her
[1:28:18] womb to another and become polluted and
[1:28:22] and become a fallen
[1:28:25] woman we're talking about the church now
[1:28:28] amen because the woman represents the
[1:28:30] church the man represents Christ and God
[1:28:33] will use this he will use this in
[1:28:35] Ephesians 5 and he he says husbands love
[1:28:38] your wives even as Christ loved the
[1:28:40] church gave himself for and and that's
[1:28:42] what a man is to do he is to love his
[1:28:44] wife and give
[1:28:46] himself amen he's to give himself for
[1:28:49] her for his children he's not to live
[1:28:52] for himself amen he's not he's not out
[1:28:55] to to take his his own vices and gamble
[1:28:58] away his money and spend his money on
[1:29:00] alcohol and tobacco and all this other
[1:29:02] stuff but he's to nurture and love and
[1:29:05] to take care of his wife and that's what
[1:29:08] Christ is to do and any man that is not
[1:29:11] doing that is a fallen man he is not in
[1:29:14] the image of Christ that is a fallen man
[1:29:18] but but again he said I'm here Paul
[1:29:21] would say I'm jealous I I'm worried
[1:29:23] about you I'm I'm I am jealous over you
[1:29:26] for his sake because you're going to be
[1:29:29] like Eve you're going to give your womb
[1:29:31] to another and there'll be a Life come
[1:29:33] out of there that will not be PR
[1:29:35] producing The Life of
[1:29:37] Christ now John also sees the vision and
[1:29:42] sees the church as a fallen woman he
[1:29:45] sees her and the Bible calls her John
[1:29:49] calls her a a woman who has lost
[1:29:53] her
[1:29:54] virtue a woman who has given her herself
[1:29:59] to receive the seed of
[1:30:04] another now I I want to just get this
[1:30:07] with you because christum as we know it
[1:30:11] today has
[1:30:13] fallen she is a fallen
[1:30:17] woman described in the Bible as a
[1:30:21] and her daughters that came out of her
[1:30:24] which would be the Protestant system is
[1:30:27] is Fallen with her that's right they're
[1:30:31] called
[1:30:32] harlets they took on the nature and
[1:30:36] emulated the life of their mother so in
[1:30:39] Revelation 171 one of the Angels Came
[1:30:43] one of the angels to me which had the
[1:30:44] seven viles and talk with me saying come
[1:30:47] hither I will show you the Judgment of
[1:30:49] the great that sth upon many
[1:30:51] Waters now these are symbolic things
[1:30:53] when you see many Waters like this is
[1:30:55] multitudes and Nations and tongues and
[1:30:59] people and so when you understand the
[1:31:02] symbology of it then you you will be
[1:31:05] able to read it as you see and you see
[1:31:07] well he said she sets upon many Waters
[1:31:10] in other words she rules over many
[1:31:13] nations upon multitudes of people right
[1:31:17] about four billion in our life today the
[1:31:20] the world today is what Rome rules over
[1:31:24] and and he says again he said um uh and
[1:31:28] he said with whom the kings of the Earth
[1:31:32] have committed fornication now watch
[1:31:36] they they have committed fornication
[1:31:38] which is a which is a a sex act of of
[1:31:42] not being married it's an adultery and
[1:31:45] the inhabitants of the world have been
[1:31:47] made drunk with the wine of her
[1:31:51] fornication and this is true all the way
[1:31:54] back from 325 ad when they begin to
[1:31:58] organize the the first Catholic Church
[1:32:01] raising it up and they become drunk on
[1:32:05] the wine of their
[1:32:07] fornication and they're formulated a
[1:32:10] trinity Doctrine and a trinity of gods
[1:32:14] and a Rome baptism and infant baptism
[1:32:18] and all other kinds of things and the
[1:32:20] worship of Saints and the worship of
[1:32:22] Mary
[1:32:25] amen and all kinds of things that they
[1:32:28] incorporated into that until today the
[1:32:31] world is
[1:32:35] drunk again she is the biggest cult in
[1:32:38] the
[1:32:39] world let me just say it clear she's the
[1:32:42] biggest cult in the world you say oh
[1:32:44] brother Tim I'm telling you what you you
[1:32:47] people you follow a prophet you're a
[1:32:49] cult well what about this that follows
[1:32:50] one man a pope 4 billion three3 to four
[1:32:54] a billion
[1:32:57] people and they owe their allegiance to
[1:33:00] him they have killed in his name
[1:33:03] murdered throughout the years she's a
[1:33:06] murderer and Wicked at
[1:33:08] heart amen now I know she's being pro
[1:33:12] promoted today as being you know the
[1:33:15] holy mother the conservative one the one
[1:33:18] with virtues and and she looks good
[1:33:21] compared to the far left
[1:33:24] but let me tell you she is Wicked at
[1:33:27] heart it's been proven all the way down
[1:33:30] when she when she's in power she rules
[1:33:35] ruthlessly she kills she murders she she
[1:33:39] ravishes she ruins she
[1:33:43] wrecks now now again again her daughters
[1:33:48] have been as guilty of some of the same
[1:33:50] thing and but I want to get this to you
[1:33:52] because Paul said when he said this
[1:33:55] about this woman and he the church he
[1:33:59] said I'm afraid I I I'm jealous over you
[1:34:04] that you're going to do what mother Eve
[1:34:06] did and watch now in verse four of
[1:34:08] chapter 11 2 Corinthians 11:4 for if he
[1:34:13] preacheth
[1:34:14] another
[1:34:17] Jesus notice this Paul would come along
[1:34:21] and he says actually what what's going
[1:34:24] to happen is there will be another one
[1:34:29] another Jesus one who we didn't
[1:34:34] preach come on right and and another
[1:34:39] Spirit which is not the Holy Spirit
[1:34:42] which you have not received or another
[1:34:43] gospel so Paul said it's another spirit
[1:34:46] it's another gospel it's another Jesus
[1:34:49] that's right
[1:34:53] now it's all all calling the name of
[1:34:57] Jesus but the worship is not the Jesus
[1:35:01] Paul
[1:35:03] preached that's why there needed come a
[1:35:05] restoration in this day to restore us
[1:35:09] back to the gospel Paul preached and
[1:35:12] introduce us to the Jesus that Paul
[1:35:17] preached because the
[1:35:20] Jesus let me let me explain to you let
[1:35:23] me just take a minute here you see what
[1:35:25] they did the theologians of Rome they
[1:35:29] took
[1:35:30] Jesus the one and they made him into a
[1:35:35] Catholic
[1:35:36] Jesus one that Minds his
[1:35:41] mama that you don't even pray to him you
[1:35:44] pray to Mary and she will pray to Jesus
[1:35:49] who will get the angry father to change
[1:35:51] his mind about killing you
[1:35:56] exactly you know there there again she
[1:35:59] will take him and cut him into
[1:36:01] three and make three deities out of
[1:36:05] him which is
[1:36:07] idolatry and then she will turn around
[1:36:10] and she she will make listen a Baptist
[1:36:12] Jesus will take Jesus Jesus he don't
[1:36:15] care about what you look like how you
[1:36:18] dress how you
[1:36:20] act just as long as you say I believe in
[1:36:23] the
[1:36:24] Jesus you make your confession of Faith
[1:36:28] you can still go to your dances you can
[1:36:30] still go to your your beard
[1:36:32] parties you can still go do your other
[1:36:35] things because this Jesus doesn't
[1:36:39] care this Jesus is going to save you no
[1:36:42] matter what you
[1:36:45] do and once that you said I believe
[1:36:48] you're always saved no matter how you
[1:36:50] live
[1:36:53] amen
[1:36:55] MH now so Paul would would bring this
[1:37:00] out and we go back to 2 Thessalonians
[1:37:03] and he says now he talks about this one
[1:37:08] that would oppose and exalt himself
[1:37:12] above all that is called God or that is
[1:37:16] worshiped so that he as God sits in the
[1:37:21] temple of God showing himself that he is
[1:37:25] God Amen now that's 2 Thessalonians
[1:37:29] chapter 2 and and what's now in verse
[1:37:33] four we were reading I want you to put
[1:37:35] it up where they can see it so he
[1:37:38] opposes and exalts himself above all
[1:37:41] that is called
[1:37:43] God amen amen exalts himself above the
[1:37:47] Holy Apostles what the Bible says you
[1:37:51] can't find one place in the entire Bible
[1:37:54] where anybody was ever baptized in
[1:37:56] titles they were ever bapt all baptized
[1:37:59] in the name of Jesus
[1:38:02] Christ amen but they oppose that and
[1:38:05] exalt themselves above that or that is
[1:38:08] worshiped all that is called God so that
[1:38:11] he as God sth in the temple of God
[1:38:14] showing himself that he's is God so
[1:38:17] another Jesus will sit in the
[1:38:20] church that's right and he will be
[1:38:22] worshiped
[1:38:24] and he'll be worshiped by
[1:38:26] millions amen and he said now you know
[1:38:30] what withholdeth verse
[1:38:32] 6 that he might be revealed in his
[1:38:35] time so there would be actually a time
[1:38:39] where he would be under such
[1:38:42] disguise but in the last day when when
[1:38:46] the light comes for it says in
[1:38:48] Zechariah 14:7 that when in the evening
[1:38:52] time it shall be light yes and it makes
[1:38:55] it clear also that this mighty one
[1:38:58] coming down in Revelation 10 his face is
[1:39:00] as it were the
[1:39:02] Sun and there's somebody going to hear
[1:39:04] his
[1:39:05] voice amen there's somebody somewhere or
[1:39:09] some seed somewhere that his light will
[1:39:12] penetrate through the
[1:39:13] darkness of the age that's
[1:39:16] right yeah and we'll recognize the truth
[1:39:20] that's right and recognize things for
[1:39:22] what they are
[1:39:24] yeah now so you see you and you know
[1:39:28] what withholdeth that he might be
[1:39:30] revealed in his
[1:39:31] time and for the mystery of iniquity
[1:39:35] here's where it is Mystery of iniquity
[1:39:38] it's already
[1:39:39] working you know Paul John would say
[1:39:42] Brethren the Antichrist is Among
[1:39:45] Us he would start out in that first age
[1:39:48] we don't have time to get into the seals
[1:39:50] but in the first seal he would come out
[1:39:53] and on a white horse looking like Christ
[1:39:56] going forth to conquer and it was that
[1:39:58] Antichrist
[1:39:59] Spirit but it looked like
[1:40:02] Jesus that's right amen now as you look
[1:40:06] at it here it comes a mystery of
[1:40:09] iniquity already working only he who
[1:40:12] leth will let that's the Holy Spirit
[1:40:15] until he be taken away do you know the
[1:40:17] holy spirit is lifting from the world
[1:40:19] that we're living in do you know it's
[1:40:22] lifting from the Fab of society do you
[1:40:25] know it's lifting from the homes and the
[1:40:28] and our our government our everything
[1:40:30] that we we have that once was once held
[1:40:33] true to to some semblance of of truth
[1:40:38] that's right and here again the here you
[1:40:41] go again the it's lifting and I want to
[1:40:44] give something to you when it
[1:40:47] lifts there's a people going with him
[1:40:53] amen so as he is as he is being pulled
[1:40:57] out or lifted out of there there's
[1:41:00] another people that is being lifted with
[1:41:02] him that's right you see we're not part
[1:41:05] of the Fallen World we are part of the
[1:41:08] world of the people that will rise we're
[1:41:12] part of the
[1:41:14] resurrection and then he said when he is
[1:41:16] taken out the way then shall that Wicked
[1:41:18] one be revealed here's when he'll be
[1:41:20] manifest whom the Lord shall consume
[1:41:22] with the spirit of his mouth and destroy
[1:41:24] him with the brightness of his coming of
[1:41:25] course that's Armageddon even his whose
[1:41:28] coming is after the working of Satan
[1:41:30] with all power and signs and lion
[1:41:32] wonders and with all deceivableness of
[1:41:35] of unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:41:38] what because they receive not the love
[1:41:42] of the truth that they might be
[1:41:44] saved brother you've got to be a truth
[1:41:46] lover in this day that's who I'm
[1:41:49] preaching today today I'm convinced I'm
[1:41:51] preaching to people who want
[1:41:54] truth might hurt sometimes amen it might
[1:41:57] go against your thinking sometimes it
[1:42:00] might go against the society and what is
[1:42:02] being promoted out there amen but you
[1:42:06] want
[1:42:07] truth give me truth Lord amen but he
[1:42:11] says and for this cause because they
[1:42:13] don't have a love for the truth God
[1:42:15] shall send them a strong delusion which
[1:42:19] we read in Revelation chapter n the
[1:42:23] opening of the bottomless
[1:42:28] pit that they might believe a lie that
[1:42:31] they should all be damned who had not
[1:42:33] believed the truth but had pleasure in
[1:42:38] unrighteousness so in the Book of
[1:42:40] Revelation chapter 9 there are these
[1:42:44] Spirits Bound in
[1:42:46] Euphrates that are released in this last
[1:42:49] day it's a it's an
[1:42:51] army it's an army
[1:42:53] it comes to reinforce the Demonic
[1:42:58] realm with 200 million Supernatural
[1:43:04] Devils here they come out of the
[1:43:08] Abyss so that the last
[1:43:12] age faces more
[1:43:16] opposition than any other
[1:43:19] age even the age is of persecution
[1:43:22] that's right even the ages of the great
[1:43:25] horrible Trials of the Dark Ages and
[1:43:28] this last age will will actually face
[1:43:32] the supernatural influx of demonic
[1:43:37] powers that will come against the people
[1:43:40] of
[1:43:40] God and will bring a strong delusion in
[1:43:44] the world that you're living in until
[1:43:47] they will grope into a insanity
[1:43:54] and the Bible said and I saw the horses
[1:43:57] and the Visions who those who setled
[1:43:59] them breastplates of fiery red and hent
[1:44:02] blue and sulfur yellow and the heads of
[1:44:04] them were like heads of lion out of
[1:44:06] their mouth came fire and smoke and
[1:44:09] brimstone it was spiritual
[1:44:12] horses these are not natural creatures
[1:44:15] did you ever see a horse like
[1:44:17] this no these are not natural these are
[1:44:21] things that that are are coming out of
[1:44:24] the
[1:44:26] pit and they're spiritual Devils or
[1:44:29] Chargers that has been bound in the
[1:44:31] Euphrates all these years Supernatural
[1:44:37] Devils that's what they
[1:44:39] are and some of them have the shape of
[1:44:43] locusts like horses prepared for battle
[1:44:47] and on their heads are crowns of of
[1:44:49] something like gold their faces were
[1:44:51] like faces of men they had hair like
[1:44:53] women's hair and their their teeth were
[1:44:55] like lion's teeth they had breastplates
[1:44:58] like breastplates of iron sound of their
[1:45:00] wings was like sounded chariots with
[1:45:02] many horses running to battles and the
[1:45:04] Tails had like scorpions and there were
[1:45:07] stings in their tails and they torment
[1:45:12] men and I want you to understand this is
[1:45:18] mentally spirits of insanity striking
[1:45:22] the people
[1:45:25] people notice it's also physical because
[1:45:30] the Bible said they'll kill a third part
[1:45:32] of
[1:45:32] men and and and let me just remind you
[1:45:36] that you know here again A lot of times
[1:45:39] when the Bible is speaking he's speaking
[1:45:40] to the Jewish people as well in instead
[1:45:44] of the whole world and so he will speak
[1:45:46] in kind of in a personal we but let me
[1:45:48] just say they killed a third part of men
[1:45:50] and during the Holocaust did you know
[1:45:52] there was a third part of the world's
[1:45:55] Jewish population wiped
[1:46:00] out now why why the river
[1:46:05] Euphrates what does that have to do with
[1:46:08] it the Euphrates River was a key factor
[1:46:12] for
[1:46:14] developing in developing early
[1:46:16] civilizations like the Babylonian
[1:46:19] Assyrian Empires and you know it was a
[1:46:22] home to many of the ancient
[1:46:25] cities that were once major centers of
[1:46:28] civilization including her which Abraham
[1:46:32] came from Babylon and Nineveh and
[1:46:35] Euphrates it was one of the four rivers
[1:46:39] that flow from the Garden of Eden in
[1:46:41] Genesis 15 and verse 18 it mentions the
[1:46:44] Euphrates as one of the boundaries of
[1:46:48] the land God promised to Abraham so I
[1:46:52] want you to understand they are not in
[1:46:54] the promised
[1:46:55] land but they are on the other
[1:46:59] side and they're bound and not able to
[1:47:02] get in because the Euphrates is a
[1:47:06] boundary that they cannot cross so on
[1:47:10] one side is the river of the river is
[1:47:13] are the Heathen condition that Abraham
[1:47:16] left a multiple deities and and idol
[1:47:19] worship it also on that other side is
[1:47:22] back
[1:47:23] the place of
[1:47:26] confusion amen where where is ARS where
[1:47:29] is where is knowledge where where his uh
[1:47:33] uh deities and multo deities and and
[1:47:36] idol worship there would would would
[1:47:39] come it would be the nation that would
[1:47:41] come and destroy Israel and take them
[1:47:44] captive and remove them from the from
[1:47:46] the promised land to Babylon and let me
[1:47:49] just say on the other counterpart
[1:47:52] remember that that's exactly what had
[1:47:54] happened with the with the the people of
[1:47:57] God the Gentile Church they were taken
[1:48:01] captive that's right and they were
[1:48:03] hauled to Babylon
[1:48:05] yeah and every one of them things out
[1:48:08] there is a Babylonian system yeah and
[1:48:11] that's why that in this day there has
[1:48:14] been a call to go back to the homeland
[1:48:18] of the
[1:48:20] Bible back to what Paul preached
[1:48:24] right because the rest of them are in
[1:48:27] Babylon and yeah there were real Jews in
[1:48:31] Babylon there was Daniel in Babylon
[1:48:33] there was there was Ezekiel in Babylon
[1:48:36] and there was Luther in Babylon and
[1:48:39] there was Wesley in
[1:48:41] Babylon somebody with me but in this day
[1:48:44] there's been a return to restore us back
[1:48:48] to our ancestral homeland of Peter Paul
[1:48:53] James and John the land of
[1:48:56] Jesus somebody with me and to restore us
[1:49:00] back Amen to worshiping unto the one
[1:49:02] true name of
[1:49:04] God Amen which is Jesus Christ Jehovah
[1:49:08] [Applause]
[1:49:10] Savior and bring us back to that
[1:49:13] original place of worship again which is
[1:49:16] in Christ that's
[1:49:19] right now on the other side of the river
[1:49:23] Riv lays B one side of the River lays
[1:49:26] Babylon the other side of the River lays
[1:49:29] the land of
[1:49:30] promise let me just tell you the little
[1:49:33] bitty piece that Israel owns of that
[1:49:35] land ain't near what God promised
[1:49:39] Abraham it would go all the way to the
[1:49:41] river
[1:49:43] Euphrates and let me but on the other
[1:49:45] side of the river is lay a land of
[1:49:49] promise wherever promise of the Bible I
[1:49:52] want to just say it where even promises
[1:49:55] we have not yet fully possessed
[1:50:00] lay because there are still promises
[1:50:04] there like the Resurrection the change
[1:50:07] of our body the
[1:50:10] Rapture now these Spirits Bound in EES
[1:50:14] were prevented from going into the land
[1:50:18] and it was something that bound them but
[1:50:21] now they're loosed in the the last day
[1:50:23] and and they bring a physical
[1:50:26] persecution against the Jews and and it
[1:50:29] drives them back into their Promised
[1:50:32] Land but it don't end there it's just
[1:50:35] constantly there trying to keep them
[1:50:38] from possessing what God promised them
[1:50:42] right and I I want you to understand you
[1:50:45] know something that bound them but
[1:50:46] they're loosing this last day and I and
[1:50:48] I want you to see even naturally we are
[1:50:52] in the vision that's
[1:50:54] [Music]
[1:50:56] right now the end is upon
[1:51:00] us and I want you to understand as well
[1:51:03] that those same evil spirits that are
[1:51:05] against the Jews possessing all that
[1:51:08] belongs to them is against
[1:51:11] us the bride of Christ from possessing
[1:51:14] everything that belongs to
[1:51:19] us he'll use every method as he can
[1:51:24] even like he's doing stirring up the own
[1:51:27] Jewish people you know to against to to
[1:51:30] you know to to to try to make a
[1:51:34] peace to try to make a peace which they
[1:51:37] know will not
[1:51:39] last which they know they just rearmed
[1:51:41] themselves
[1:51:43] again and that Philadelphia Corridor
[1:51:46] there is seven miles but on the border
[1:51:49] of Israel and and Egypt Egypt had
[1:51:51] promised to be in a treaty and at peace
[1:51:54] with with Israel and they have
[1:51:57] dug
[1:51:59] thousands hundreds if not thousands of
[1:52:02] of big tunnels under there and shuffling
[1:52:05] in arms and weaponry and everything and
[1:52:08] even during this time of resupplying
[1:52:13] Hamas uh you know with with arms and
[1:52:16] everything else because their hatred I I
[1:52:20] want you to know something the devil
[1:52:22] hates hat God's people whether it be the
[1:52:25] natural Israel or the spiritual Israel
[1:52:27] the devil hates you that's right and
[1:52:29] he's against you he wants to destroy you
[1:52:32] he'll have no mercy on your family your
[1:52:35] little ones your children right the AG
[1:52:39] it doesn't
[1:52:43] matter they want one thing you
[1:52:46] eradicated that's they will not be happy
[1:52:49] until every Jewish person is dead
[1:52:55] because they want to wipe out that Seed
[1:52:58] of
[1:53:00] Abraham because Satan don't want the
[1:53:02] word of God fulfilled because
[1:53:05] zachariah's prophecy said that one day
[1:53:08] they'll get a revelation and they will
[1:53:09] mourn in their houses for the ones that
[1:53:11] they
[1:53:12] pierced and they will look on him whom
[1:53:15] they have pierced and they will mourn as
[1:53:17] if it was for their only son and they'll
[1:53:19] recognize their Messiah this was that
[1:53:22] they were blinded far but so we could
[1:53:26] come in and now the Gentiles are being
[1:53:28] blinded under the strong
[1:53:34] delusion because now it's faing to turn
[1:53:37] back you see we are the last of the
[1:53:40] Gentile age Le oia and the age is not
[1:53:43] over because it's a part of the Gentile
[1:53:46] dispensation and as long as the Gentile
[1:53:48] dispensation is on that we are in the
[1:53:51] leoan age that's right so well I'm in it
[1:53:55] but I'm not a part of it you're crazy
[1:53:57] that's foolish talking if you are in it
[1:54:00] you're a part of it you're either the
[1:54:01] Overcomer in
[1:54:04] it or you're the other one that's right
[1:54:07] that is wretched miserable blind and
[1:54:09] naked you're either the one going to sit
[1:54:11] on the throne with
[1:54:13] him or you're the one that's going to be
[1:54:16] rejected that's right because of your
[1:54:19] naked condition so you when when we see
[1:54:22] here is a part of the insanity of the
[1:54:24] age is what it is but you know the
[1:54:26] seventh seal with his open breaks the
[1:54:29] Silence of his coming and it ushers in
[1:54:31] the end time events and there Satan will
[1:54:34] have his final stand and the world that
[1:54:37] we know will crumble under its
[1:54:42] wrath
[1:54:44] now there have been seven continuous
[1:54:47] visions that I want to point out that
[1:54:51] God's Prophet had in this
[1:54:55] day and the reason why that we believe
[1:54:58] him to be a
[1:54:59] prophet is
[1:55:02] because because the bible
[1:55:05] promises Revelation 10:7 that in the
[1:55:08] days the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:55:10] he sounds the mystery of God would be
[1:55:12] finished God promises a Leo to and age
[1:55:15] messenger the seventh one God promises
[1:55:19] that before the coming of the great and
[1:55:21] Dreadful day of the Lord I'll send you
[1:55:22] Elijah the prophet and Elijah was a
[1:55:25] restorer so he would restore them back
[1:55:28] to true worship ter you know tear down
[1:55:31] the idols of Baal and rebuild the The
[1:55:34] Altar and put the sacrifice in the right
[1:55:36] place and the fire would fall and he
[1:55:38] would be Vindicated then by a pillar of
[1:55:41] fire so you know we there there's
[1:55:44] there's multiple reasons but another is
[1:55:47] because all of his Visions come to pass
[1:55:56] standing on the platform day after day I
[1:55:59] was just going back through just going
[1:56:02] back through some things this week in my
[1:56:05] mind as I went back thinking of as a boy
[1:56:09] being in brother Brandon's
[1:56:11] meetings thinking of the events that
[1:56:14] went on I called A A friend of mine um
[1:56:18] that I've known he was a son of the
[1:56:20] associate pastor to um Life
[1:56:25] Tabernacle and and
[1:56:28] um and so you know as as we as we talked
[1:56:32] and we visited there for some times I I
[1:56:36] was asking him just kind of put in his
[1:56:38] memory of the way that things
[1:56:41] went and and so as um as we talked and
[1:56:46] and visited um you know I I I could
[1:56:50] recall and go back over some some of the
[1:56:53] events and I went back and done some
[1:56:55] searches and thinking about the woman
[1:56:58] the woman that I as a boy
[1:57:01] 1963 I can remember brother brandham I
[1:57:04] can remember brother brandham there
[1:57:06] turning his back to the congregation and
[1:57:08] showing us as it was in the days of
[1:57:10] Sodom and calling people out one of them
[1:57:13] was a lady that that I went to church
[1:57:15] with her name was Sister Boyd called her
[1:57:18] by name said to here you you're
[1:57:21] Afflicted with Bur cus and she had btis
[1:57:23] in her arm and God healed her in that
[1:57:27] meeting she was a woman that I sat with
[1:57:30] in church many times would lay my head
[1:57:32] over on in her lap as a little kid and
[1:57:34] go to sleep sometimes during service
[1:57:36] take a little nap you know sometimes us
[1:57:39] kids need a nap even if they're old
[1:57:43] kids but anyway you know as I was going
[1:57:47] through that I I mean I I remembered I
[1:57:49] remembered different things
[1:57:52] different things that I I went through
[1:57:54] as a as a child and and remember why it
[1:57:58] is remember going over one more time
[1:58:01] what it is that we know these things are
[1:58:06] true you know I I I was in a meeting and
[1:58:09] Jimbo you might remember but there was a
[1:58:11] man by the name of Wayne Coleman in the
[1:58:15] meeting and Wayne was known as um he he
[1:58:21] went he he was a a wrestler and he be
[1:58:23] won awards as a Mr teenage America and
[1:58:28] and the and the strongest man I think he
[1:58:31] he um was right next to the the highest
[1:58:34] weight lifter somewhere around he could
[1:58:36] bench press like 605 lounds where the
[1:58:38] other got about 10 more pounds than
[1:58:40] him and and you know he was he he was
[1:58:44] there in the meeting he was preaching to
[1:58:47] the youth I went to his youth meeting he
[1:58:50] took a three point phone book which was
[1:58:53] about twice the size and ripped it in
[1:58:56] two in front of us showing his power and
[1:58:59] his strength and then he was speaking
[1:59:02] you know to the young
[1:59:04] people I read articles about him he died
[1:59:07] a couple of years ago he died now A
[1:59:10] couple of years ago with liver failure
[1:59:12] and after taking steroids and having
[1:59:15] hepatitis and other issues that went and
[1:59:17] he had a liver transplant and but he he
[1:59:20] he went under the the name
[1:59:22] his his stage name was Billy Graham he
[1:59:26] named him named himself after the that
[1:59:29] Evangelist Billy Graham and that was his
[1:59:32] stage name but he he was there in
[1:59:35] brother bram's
[1:59:37] meetings and it's on
[1:59:40] tape and Brother brandham Talks you know
[1:59:43] is speaking there and and and and that
[1:59:46] meeting and he and he turns to him and
[1:59:49] he says you he said something with your
[1:59:53] wife he said oh I see it now and the man
[1:59:56] at the moment he bows his head and says
[1:59:59] God forgive
[2:00:00] me and and when he when he does brother
[2:00:04] bradam said it's confessed now I was
[2:00:06] going to say it out out here before the
[2:00:08] public but I won't now but in the
[2:00:11] newspaper said you know he quit the
[2:00:14] ministry because he didn't pay enough
[2:00:17] and because he bed too many of his
[2:00:21] female flock
[2:00:24] so you know it was those kind of things
[2:00:26] that we would see in the in those
[2:00:29] meetings like that where where where God
[2:00:32] would discern the thoughts and intents
[2:00:35] of the heart and and things that was so
[2:00:38] accurate and so pinpoint because only
[2:00:41] the word can do this but anyway there
[2:00:43] was seven continuous visions that was
[2:00:46] given and brother bradam said as a
[2:00:47] servant of God I've had multitudes of
[2:00:50] visions of which none has ever failed
[2:00:52] and that's what they said of over and
[2:00:55] over and over and over of the accounts
[2:00:58] of his ministry nothing nothing ever
[2:01:02] failed and he said I there was seven
[2:01:05] major continuous visions that came to
[2:01:08] him one morning in June of
[2:01:10] 1933 the Lord Jesus spoke to him that
[2:01:14] and said that the coming the Lord was
[2:01:16] drawing nigh and the before that he came
[2:01:19] seven major events would transpire
[2:01:23] and he said I wrote them all down that
[2:01:24] morning I gave forth a revelation of the
[2:01:27] Lord and the first Vision that melini
[2:01:29] would invade Ethiopia and that nations
[2:01:32] would fall at his steps and that Vision
[2:01:33] surely did cause some repercussions some
[2:01:36] were very angry when I said it and would
[2:01:38] not believe it but it happened that way
[2:01:40] he just walked in there with his modern
[2:01:41] arms took over and the natives didn't
[2:01:43] have a chance but the vision also said
[2:01:45] mellan would come to a horrible end with
[2:01:47] his own people turning on him this came
[2:01:50] to pass exactly as it said the next
[2:01:52] vision for told that an Austrian by the
[2:01:55] name of Adolf Hitler would rise up as a
[2:01:57] dictator over Germany and that he would
[2:02:01] draw the world into war it showed the
[2:02:03] SEC GRE line and how our troops would
[2:02:06] have a terrible time to overcome it and
[2:02:08] then it showed that Hitler would come to
[2:02:11] mysterious end the third Vision was in
[2:02:14] the Realms of world politics for it
[2:02:16] showed me that there would be three
[2:02:18] great ISM fascism Nazism communism and
[2:02:21] the ver two would be swallowed up into
[2:02:23] the third in the voice admonish watch
[2:02:26] Russia watch Russia keep your eye on the
[2:02:30] King of the North and I want you to
[2:02:32] remember she's got a part in
[2:02:34] this the fourth Vision showed great
[2:02:38] advances in science it would come after
[2:02:40] the the second world war it was headed
[2:02:42] up by vision of a of a bubbletop car
[2:02:45] that was running down beautiful highways
[2:02:47] under uh remote control that people
[2:02:50] appeared to be seated in in this car
[2:02:52] without a steering wheel and they were
[2:02:54] playing some sort of game to amuse
[2:02:58] themselves and I just ask where are
[2:03:02] we when we now have
[2:03:04] airplanes that are taking off Landing
[2:03:07] doing all their drills
[2:03:10] unmanned I'm not I'm not talking about
[2:03:12] drones I'm talking about full-fledged
[2:03:15] Fighters and and and then we then he
[2:03:19] said the fifth Vision had to do with the
[2:03:21] moral problem of our age centered mostly
[2:03:25] around women and God showed me that
[2:03:28] women began to be out of their place
[2:03:30] with the graning of the vote and then
[2:03:31] they cut off their hair and it signified
[2:03:34] they were no longer under the authority
[2:03:35] of man but insisted on equal rights and
[2:03:38] are in most cases more than equal rights
[2:03:42] and she adopted men's clothing went to a
[2:03:44] state of undress till the last picture I
[2:03:46] saw was this woman naked except for a
[2:03:49] little fig leaf type apron and with this
[2:03:52] Vision I saw the terrible perversion and
[2:03:55] moral plight of the whole world watch
[2:03:57] now the the whole world coming under
[2:04:02] terrible perversion and moral plight
[2:04:06] listen then the six Vision There Rose up
[2:04:09] in America a most beautiful but cruel
[2:04:13] woman she held the people in a complete
[2:04:15] power and I believe this was the rise of
[2:04:18] the Roman Catholic Church though I knew
[2:04:20] it could possibly be a vision vision of
[2:04:22] some some woman rising in great power
[2:04:25] due to the popular vote by women and the
[2:04:28] last and the seventh Vision wherein I
[2:04:31] heard a most terrible explosion and I
[2:04:35] turned to look and I saw nothing but
[2:04:38] debris craters and smoke all over the
[2:04:42] land of
[2:04:44] America now church we are here in the
[2:04:49] end time and this
[2:04:52] is the
[2:04:56] vision and when we're looking at it we
[2:04:59] want to understand where are we in this
[2:05:03] Vision so we know where to place our
[2:05:08] faith now I'm going to cover some things
[2:05:12] today I'm going to try to do it within
[2:05:14] this next hour because I don't want to
[2:05:15] take a part two on this
[2:05:18] part but I want to cover some things
[2:05:20] that that we'll try to help you place
[2:05:23] and get some understanding of where we
[2:05:25] are in this day but as brother Brenham
[2:05:28] told us years ago and and I want you to
[2:05:30] look at his prophetic
[2:05:32] insight and and many times brother
[2:05:36] brandham would give what we might call
[2:05:40] opinions and a lot of times you want to
[2:05:43] say well that's just an
[2:05:46] opinion but you know if you have an
[2:05:48] opinion it's influenced or formed by by
[2:05:51] something that's
[2:05:54] right amen so it might be influenced by
[2:05:58] social media something you heard on the
[2:06:01] news could be something your parents
[2:06:03] taught you something you learned at
[2:06:05] church or at school or anywhere your
[2:06:08] opinion is made up of things that you
[2:06:12] have been exposed
[2:06:14] to so you develop an opinion may be
[2:06:18] right may be wrong so you say well this
[2:06:22] was the man's opinion well I tell you uh
[2:06:26] I would really be careful before I just
[2:06:29] dismissed
[2:06:31] it because the opinion of a godly man
[2:06:35] yeah is one much times greater than the
[2:06:39] opinion of an ungodly man and the
[2:06:42] opinion of a man influenced by the angel
[2:06:45] of the
[2:06:46] Lord and by thousands of
[2:06:49] Visions is a lot greater worth and value
[2:06:54] than somebody who ain't spiritual at
[2:07:00] all so
[2:07:02] now let's
[2:07:04] just take everything for what it's worth
[2:07:08] and try to go forward into this and
[2:07:11] understand where we want to place our
[2:07:14] faith now brother bramman he and
[2:07:17] recognized and acting on the word he
[2:07:19] said I wonder what takes place when the
[2:07:21] next president comes in of course he's
[2:07:23] on the eve of of Kennedy he said uh he
[2:07:27] said God gave us one Godly Man old
[2:07:29] Dwight eyes and hour what's the next
[2:07:30] thing comes in we might have a rat the
[2:07:32] next time sure enough but there's coming
[2:07:36] a pharaoh who doesn't know Joseph now
[2:07:38] that's
[2:07:40] prophecy well what prophecy the Bible I
[2:07:44] keep trying to tell you what's in the
[2:07:47] Bible is
[2:07:49] prophesying of the
[2:07:53] time so now so again he says he said
[2:07:57] they coming a pharaoh who doesn't know
[2:07:58] Joseph remember I'll get to that in a
[2:08:00] second politics is corrupted we know
[2:08:02] that and yeah you know Kennedy was our
[2:08:06] first Catholic President who knew not
[2:08:09] the freedom of religion as a
[2:08:11] Catholic being a Catholic he KN he knew
[2:08:15] not what he didn't know freedom of
[2:08:17] religion he came over we came here as a
[2:08:21] pro as a Protestant people there because
[2:08:24] we wanted
[2:08:26] freedom from the tyranny of
[2:08:30] Rome amen and even our daughters the
[2:08:33] Church of England which is patterned
[2:08:35] after
[2:08:36] Rome so again that's why we came that's
[2:08:39] why the Plymouth Rock that's why that's
[2:08:41] why the pilgrim fathers that's why all
[2:08:44] of these things that wanted a land
[2:08:46] where they could be free to believe what
[2:08:49] they
[2:08:50] wanted so we had the first president and
[2:08:54] that he did not have that for his he was
[2:08:58] a pharaoh who knew not our
[2:09:03] struggles and he said I believe you'll
[2:09:05] make a good president it's not him it's
[2:09:07] that system behind him wait till she
[2:09:09] gets wormed in the cabinet ever Waits
[2:09:13] again and then watch what happened but
[2:09:16] now I'm going to stop and just take a
[2:09:19] side
[2:09:20] step you talking about a pharaoh who not
[2:09:23] knew not Joseph right now we got a woman
[2:09:26] rising in
[2:09:27] power and she's now the vice president
[2:09:30] and looks soon looks like soon will be
[2:09:32] the the
[2:09:34] president and she has no ties listen to
[2:09:37] me she has no ties to our nation's proud
[2:09:42] history you know she's born to a woman
[2:09:44] who was not a citizen a dad from Jamaica
[2:09:47] who at some point became a naturalized
[2:09:49] citizen but it all points to that she
[2:09:51] was was born to parents who was just
[2:09:53] resided in America and were not citizens
[2:09:56] and by and by the way her her father
[2:09:58] Donald Harris is described as being a
[2:10:01] combative Marxist in Economist who is
[2:10:05] against our American way of
[2:10:08] life that's what they Herald him as so
[2:10:11] being born in America to immigrants she
[2:10:13] was she's deemed a natural born
[2:10:18] citizen and so they say that makes her
[2:10:21] elg of now and so after and of course
[2:10:25] that's to a new interpretation of the
[2:10:27] Constitution but after her parents
[2:10:29] divorced in 1972 at the age of seven she
[2:10:32] was raised in
[2:10:34] Canada and so then she comes back to
[2:10:37] America and she a a woman is a woman who
[2:10:40] is not connected to our
[2:10:43] forefathers to our American
[2:10:46] Heritage she wants freedom from religion
[2:10:51] no freedom of
[2:10:54] religion now you know they're all
[2:10:57] screaming
[2:10:58] democracy they're all screaming freedom
[2:11:01] and and and they're you know going to
[2:11:04] stand for our freedom what the freedoms
[2:11:06] is is the freedom to kill their
[2:11:11] babies the freedom to to marry same-sex
[2:11:17] Partners this freedom to change your
[2:11:20] children
[2:11:22] from a boy to a girl or a girl to a
[2:11:26] boy that's the freedoms they're talking
[2:11:29] about they're not talking about the
[2:11:31] freedoms that our GI has fought
[2:11:34] for to keep the world free right they
[2:11:38] want to destroy the very fabric of
[2:11:43] humanity now after the vision after this
[2:11:47] the vision shows that America will lay
[2:11:50] in ashes
[2:11:52] so we know that really War's an end you
[2:11:55] know I mean come on B and laugh at
[2:11:58] people because they wanted to their
[2:11:59] their second amendment Amendment you

[2:15:56] I'm sorry I'm I'm I'm I'm fed up with
[2:15:59] some of the things that are going on in
[2:16:00] this world and if if I get a little
[2:16:02] strong in my
[2:16:08] speech maybe you can pull down a little
[2:16:10] Grace and say God help brother Tim have
[2:16:12] some Grace this morning but brother
[2:16:15] brandham said you can't go down here to
[2:16:17] school and get a kid with the education
[2:16:18] he's twofold more child of hell when he
[2:16:21] comes out then when he goes in that was
[2:16:23] 1960 when I started to
[2:16:27] school and I'm 70 years old
[2:16:31] now and I went to school on my first my
[2:16:35] sixth birthday September the 3rd
[2:16:40] 1960 but he said you can't send a kid to
[2:16:44] school and get him with the education
[2:16:45] he's twofold more child of hell when he
[2:16:48] comes out than when he went in that's
[2:16:49] right he's said let the teacher say
[2:16:52] something about it he said he'll get
[2:16:55] killed they'll form a little cluck and
[2:16:58] go out there and shoot the teacher and
[2:17:00] take him and string him up and and and
[2:17:03] he he talks about he said give give
[2:17:05] college education these kids he said
[2:17:07] they do need it but the devil's got
[2:17:11] them amen it it isn't it isn't the the
[2:17:15] fundamentals of Education that will be
[2:17:17] helpful in getting jobs it's all the
[2:17:20] liberal Arts it's all the leftist agenda
[2:17:24] that our educators are now demons in the
[2:17:27] school system demonizing your
[2:17:33] kids that's why you get the Holy Ghost
[2:17:35] before you go
[2:17:38] there amen and then he says childbearing
[2:17:41] at the end that Womanhood motherhood why
[2:17:44] birth controls practice everywhere
[2:17:45] little dogs took his
[2:17:47] place now we understand about
[2:17:51] Family Family Planning and and so on
[2:17:55] things like that but we're not talking
[2:17:57] about
[2:18:00] abortion we we're we're we're not
[2:18:03] talking about not raising children for
[2:18:07] and nurture them in the things of
[2:18:09] God and if you think that the love for
[2:18:11] family and children has been
[2:18:13] diminished out
[2:18:15] there then I want to say what about
[2:18:19] spiritually if the family has been
[2:18:21] attacked like that what about the church
[2:18:23] even message churches don't want those
[2:18:25] screaming shouting acts 238 blabbering
[2:18:28] screaming
[2:18:29] youngans come on now and they're
[2:18:32] practicing in our Church's spiritual
[2:18:35] birth
[2:18:38] control cuz they don't want them brought
[2:18:40] to
[2:18:42] birth
[2:18:44] amen morals there are no morals women
[2:18:47] dressing evil come through television
[2:18:49] all kinds of impers ation of evil
[2:18:51] persons people of Hollywood and it only
[2:18:54] got worse with social media and all
[2:18:56] these
[2:18:57] influences educations at the end
[2:18:59] politics at the end Wars at the end
[2:19:01] civilizations at the end all these
[2:19:03] things are at the end but what can we do
[2:19:06] what is next we at the end of all
[2:19:09] things let me tell you if you hadn't
[2:19:11] known it you are in the leoan age and
[2:19:15] there's not another age
[2:19:19] right the times that the Gentile ends
[2:19:22] with the leodan
[2:19:24] age that's what a prophet
[2:19:27] said now you think of the evil spirit of
[2:19:29] insanity in the
[2:19:31] world you know that evil spirit of
[2:19:34] insanity that can take a baby in the
[2:19:37] womb and they've now done this by the
[2:19:40] millions not one not two not a half a
[2:19:43] dozen
[2:19:44] Millions you know take a baby in the
[2:19:47] womb and kill
[2:19:48] it and yet to destroy an eagle's egg
[2:19:52] would be one year in prison and a $5,000
[2:19:56] fine and under federal law a first
[2:19:58] offense of killing a bald eagle can
[2:20:00] bring up to a year in prison and a
[2:20:02] $100,000 fine I I say protect the Eagles
[2:20:06] that's fine but look what they're doing
[2:20:09] to the kids this is
[2:20:12] insanity we have a world that is groping
[2:20:16] in in Insanity Whoever thought
[2:20:21] that a Supreme Court Justice would not
[2:20:24] be able to Define what a woman
[2:20:29] is who would ever thought that people
[2:20:31] would be go so insane that they could
[2:20:34] believe that a girl could change to a be
[2:20:37] a boy or male could decide to be a
[2:20:38] female or a cat or a
[2:20:43] dog brother or that a man could run as
[2:20:47] vice president who supported putting
[2:20:50] tampons and boys
[2:20:54] bathrooms that's sick I said that's
[2:20:59] sick who could have predicted the
[2:21:02] society would become insane but the
[2:21:05] Bible said it would he said they would
[2:21:07] be wretched miserable naked and not know
[2:21:11] it that's right could you imagine people
[2:21:15] becoming naked and not knowing it yet
[2:21:18] that's what Revelation 3 says the they
[2:21:20] to see
[2:21:21] age that they would not have the state
[2:21:24] of mind to know it that's how strong
[2:21:27] Insanity would be in the last day you
[2:21:29] said brother you've lost me in my sermon
[2:21:31] okay all of these demons coming out of
[2:21:34] the
[2:21:35] Abyss spirits of insanity I done told
[2:21:38] you what it is coming upon
[2:21:41] people amen taking over their lives
[2:21:44] running their homes in their marriages
[2:21:46] in their schools everywhere that you
[2:21:48] look yeah till we are living in an
[2:21:52] insane
[2:21:58] world the world is in a Sodom condition
[2:22:02] brother Bram would talk about it 1963 he
[2:22:05] said I was in my motel today out there
[2:22:08] laid a woman with not enough clothes to
[2:22:10] water a musket
[2:22:14] shotgun well you probably didn't
[2:22:17] understand that but you know a musket
[2:22:21] they had to they put the a wad and they
[2:22:23] packed the the pack with powder and put
[2:22:25] a wad on top and then you know it would
[2:22:29] it would fire it would fire there
[2:22:31] against that and and and then a bullet
[2:22:33] on top of the wad and and it would fire
[2:22:35] against that and and out it would go and
[2:22:37] he said there's not
[2:22:39] enough enough clothes on to wad that's
[2:22:42] about a piece about like a quarter to
[2:22:45] water a musket
[2:22:47] shotgun and he said don't you realize
[2:22:49] that's the de
[2:22:51] yeah and he said her husband was laying
[2:22:54] out the same way that cold wind they
[2:22:55] think their body's so pretty they have
[2:22:57] to show it don't you realize that's the
[2:22:59] devil's stripping their clothes off only
[2:23:01] the insane does
[2:23:03] that Legion did it because he was
[2:23:07] crazy and he said but we have that and
[2:23:10] we call it
[2:23:13] style that's called modern we call it
[2:23:16] the
[2:23:17] devil I wonder come on is there message
[2:23:21] Believers here today that could agree
[2:23:23] with that and say it's the
[2:23:26] devil it's not style it's not
[2:23:31] modern amen it's the devil and he said
[2:23:35] it's the devil possession demon
[2:23:38] possession not
[2:23:42] oppression so it's even went beyond just
[2:23:44] being oppressed they're
[2:23:47] possessed said sex sex is
[2:23:51] appeal he said is practice in school in
[2:23:53] churches and pastors are afraid to
[2:23:55] rebuke it and he said they get their own
[2:23:58] ideas because at their morg they never
[2:24:01] rebuke
[2:24:02] it buddy I tell you if you quit
[2:24:05] listening to the prophet then you you
[2:24:07] are you are get shocked by some of the
[2:24:09] things that I'm saying you better be
[2:24:12] listening to
[2:24:14] it amen he said I heard a minister say
[2:24:17] when they invented this blue stuff for
[2:24:18] the eyes and red lips and made it pretty
[2:24:20] your world a minister of the Gospel in
[2:24:22] the Pulpit would make a remark like that
[2:24:24] he needs a trip to Calvary that's
[2:24:27] exactly right when the Bible condemns it
[2:24:29] I I heard a man preaching the other day
[2:24:31] on the radio and said wow even a barn
[2:24:34] looks better with paint on
[2:24:37] it I said my wife ain't no
[2:24:41] Barn am Hallelujah I kind of Wonder the
[2:24:44] way God made
[2:24:47] her not some false front
[2:24:51] come on Amen because it comes and he
[2:24:54] said the Pentecostal group told his
[2:24:56] sister not this come into Pentecost now
[2:24:59] you got to understand that that is the
[2:25:03] last move of God Be Where God sent a
[2:25:07] prophet to them to bring them into
[2:25:11] further restoration cuz they had
[2:25:13] restoration of
[2:25:15] gifts they were really part of the
[2:25:17] Reformation but they had a restoration
[2:25:19] of gifts but but God was going to
[2:25:21] restore it all so he sends a prophet and
[2:25:24] he said a Pentecostal group told his
[2:25:26] sister to come to the place crying cuz
[2:25:29] she had her hair done up in the back of
[2:25:30] her head with long hair said your your
[2:25:32] spare tire might get deflated you must
[2:25:34] cut that hair off cuz the Bible said
[2:25:36] Isaiah 50 chap 5th chapter had round
[2:25:39] tires like a moon and now how can the
[2:25:41] bible say that a woman
[2:25:44] does now how can the bible say that a
[2:25:47] woman does an uncommon thing she's not
[2:25:49] fit to live with when she cuts her hair
[2:25:51] she proves and she dishonors her head
[2:25:54] and then long hair and then how can you
[2:25:57] make the Bible say something like that
[2:25:59] what's the matter with our
[2:26:02] Pentecostal women you've seen too much
[2:26:06] television you've seen too much of the
[2:26:09] world and not enough of God's word
[2:26:11] interest you now that's what the Bible
[2:26:13] said that's what the Bible said that's
[2:26:15] not me that's the
[2:26:16] Bible but you see you see it was like I
[2:26:20] was talking to that brother brother Neil
[2:26:21] Palmer from down in Manny that I was
[2:26:23] telling you was at Life
[2:26:25] Tabernacle you know it was once the
[2:26:28] whole of chrisom believed in
[2:26:32] Holiness you know Wesley brought this
[2:26:36] truth and HD it to the
[2:26:39] world that's right amen Holiness men do
[2:26:43] not smoke they're
[2:26:45] Sanctified you cannot have the Holy
[2:26:47] Ghost and suck cigarettes there's a
[2:26:49] demon on the end inside of you calling
[2:26:51] for
[2:26:52] that and it's got to be cast out and
[2:26:55] there is Deliverance for
[2:26:57] it amen you got to realize what it is
[2:27:01] it's killing you it's destroying
[2:27:04] you and and but I mean that's just
[2:27:07] that's that's just where Satan gets in
[2:27:09] the mild form he'll let you be a good
[2:27:12] person or whatever as long as you miss
[2:27:13] that
[2:27:14] life but you see it used to be the whole
[2:27:18] of chrisom believed in holiness ly
[2:27:20] brought this truth he he Herald it
[2:27:22] through the world you know uh they they
[2:27:26] taught that without Holiness no man
[2:27:29] shall see the Lord that's a Bible
[2:27:31] scripture by the way you see Holiness
[2:27:34] was not something new that brother
[2:27:35] brandham taught he was just defending
[2:27:38] the principles of
[2:27:41] Faith the things that they always and
[2:27:44] all had in common but now because and
[2:27:49] because with the women's lib here comes
[2:27:53] in with the women's lib uh the women's
[2:27:57] movement affect the church watch these
[2:28:00] demons out of hell coming now and
[2:28:04] calling it liberating women and comes
[2:28:07] right into the church and going to
[2:28:10] liberate the
[2:28:13] sisters and you know so what I found was
[2:28:16] with my with my cousins that was you
[2:28:19] know part of were and and my dad and his
[2:28:23] family part of his family was was oness
[2:28:25] people the other people on the other
[2:28:27] side were were Trinity and they were all
[2:28:29] Pentecostals but the ones that went pent
[2:28:32] went into the Trinity they all began to
[2:28:34] cut their hair paint their face wear
[2:28:36] trousers and next thing you know you
[2:28:38] know my my first cousins that were girl
[2:28:41] ministers in the church were wearing Min
[2:28:43] skirts that would make anybody blush
[2:28:50] why was
[2:28:51] that because the
[2:28:54] spirit got in the
[2:28:57] church pulling the women down why cuz
[2:29:01] she's a
[2:29:02] type of the
[2:29:05] bride and she is to reflect in her life
[2:29:09] the bride of Christ where the man is to
[2:29:12] reflect the groom the head of the
[2:29:16] body now so you see it got right in to
[2:29:20] there and he said what the trouble was
[2:29:22] he said the devil landed up here in
[2:29:24] Hollywood and come through television
[2:29:26] stripped off our women and done
[2:29:27] everything ungodly to be done and people
[2:29:30] call it all
[2:29:31] right you see and then he said then they
[2:29:34] called it liberation of women and he
[2:29:36] said it's a disgrace it is the works of
[2:29:39] the devil amen and because the headship
[2:29:43] of Christ was rejected in the church
[2:29:47] causing her lewdness and un addess and
[2:29:51] reject your husband then the woman who
[2:29:54] is representative of the Church begin to
[2:29:57] rebel against the headship of her
[2:30:00] husband now let me stop here just for a
[2:30:02] minute because a lot of times we got men
[2:30:05] want to stand up and they want they want
[2:30:07] to exert their Authority with headship
[2:30:11] let me tell you where headship lies and
[2:30:14] that is if your head is Christ right
[2:30:17] amen then your wife is supposed to be
[2:30:19] subject to
[2:30:21] you amen because you're going to rule by
[2:30:24] the word of God you're going to lead
[2:30:26] you're going to guide by the word of God
[2:30:29] you'll have those principles in your
[2:30:31] life you will follow that man as as he
[2:30:33] follows
[2:30:35] Christ amen but but you know you you you
[2:30:39] know some some of these backslid men
[2:30:41] want to get up and say well you got to
[2:30:43] do what I say no you don't you got to do
[2:30:46] what the word of God said the word of
[2:30:47] God takes preeminence over what any man
[2:30:50] say I don't care if he's your
[2:30:53] pastor that's
[2:30:56] right
[2:30:57] now and no Pastor let me just straighten
[2:31:00] that out no Pastor is ahead of the Bride
[2:31:03] either Christ is ahead of the
[2:31:07] Bride
[2:31:08] amen now so you know she's not for his
[2:31:13] seed to produce more like him she's to
[2:31:16] produce more like
[2:31:17] Christ right he's to he's to be a
[2:31:21] unic with no seeds of his own amen
[2:31:24] present the word of God and let her let
[2:31:26] the word of God be in the but anyway you
[2:31:29] know there again brother Brandon would
[2:31:31] tell us he says that that the I believe
[2:31:34] the world is gone completely insane you
[2:31:38] know it's the truth you know it's a time
[2:31:40] that people can't judge between right
[2:31:43] and wrong or truth and error and this is
[2:31:46] what the Bible said he said it would be
[2:31:49] they would call right wrong and they
[2:31:51] would make wrong
[2:31:53] right so now again he said you know he
[2:31:57] would give illustration he said woman 50
[2:32:00] years ago if she'd have walked out like
[2:32:02] they're walking out now in their shorts
[2:32:05] or pikinis or whatever they call them
[2:32:07] said they would put them in a mental
[2:32:09] institution they would arrest them
[2:32:11] because they had lost their
[2:32:14] minds amen and he said it's still a
[2:32:17] mental deficiency yeah
[2:32:20] what will you say where's it coming from
[2:32:22] brother Tim is it just perverted food no
[2:32:25] it's the perverted gospel that is being
[2:32:28] preached that has caused them to have a
[2:32:31] mental deficiency and an
[2:32:34] insanity now L let's just let's go
[2:32:37] quickly I I'll tell you what they won't
[2:32:39] acknowledge it but that's a prostitute
[2:32:42] Spirit upon them that want to address
[2:32:43] that way now their mother taught them to
[2:32:46] do like that you know you had this woman
[2:32:49] Dolly Parton
[2:32:51] she's a granddaughter of a Holiness
[2:32:53] preacher she defied
[2:32:55] him and her church because she wanted to
[2:32:58] dress like the woman of the
[2:33:02] night now we have a whole world dressing
[2:33:07] like women of the
[2:33:09] night and they're actually naked and
[2:33:13] don't know
[2:33:15] it I mean do you know walking out with
[2:33:17] these shorts on it's just like walking
[2:33:20] out in their in their
[2:33:22] underclothes they're
[2:33:24] naked and they don't realize that I mean
[2:33:27] oh they would freak out you know if they
[2:33:29] were caught maybe in their panties but
[2:33:31] let me tell you what they're
[2:33:33] wearing is this as luden crud is
[2:33:37] that come on now amen and do you know
[2:33:41] it's an evil spirit that's anointing
[2:33:44] them and it comes from the
[2:33:47] abyss amen now like I said 100 years ago
[2:33:50] people knew that was
[2:33:53] wrong amen we we should nature itself
[2:33:56] should teach you that's
[2:33:59] wrong come on the only man in the Bible
[2:34:02] took his clothes off like that was
[2:34:04] Legion and and when he got his right
[2:34:05] mind he put clothes
[2:34:07] on so it just shows you when devil
[2:34:10] possession takes over and people are
[2:34:12] innocent in the sense that they are
[2:34:14] brought up that way they're taught oh
[2:34:17] this is cute and you know and from
[2:34:19] little girls are taught to walk out in
[2:34:21] the before the public in their in their
[2:34:25] underclothes scany
[2:34:29] dressed and it's
[2:34:32] insanity and it's because it is a part
[2:34:36] of what has come out of the
[2:34:39] Abyss now there's hideous things like
[2:34:44] the Bible said like Locust with long
[2:34:46] hair and it's to torment those women who
[2:34:49] cut their hair off and wait until we
[2:34:53] leave from here because what you see now
[2:34:56] is only
[2:34:58] amateure to what is going to be loosed
[2:35:01] in the
[2:35:02] tribulation they will go so crazy
[2:35:04] brother Bram told us he said they would
[2:35:06] see birds with a with wingspread of of
[2:35:09] of a mile long he said they would see
[2:35:12] ants the size of mountains he he said
[2:35:15] it'll be in their mind because they will
[2:35:17] go totally insane
[2:35:20] so the insanity that you see now is only
[2:35:24] amature to what is
[2:35:27] coming because it only magnifies you

[2:41:22] realm and what is doing to

[2:41:28] to kill and
[2:41:35] destroy I talked to an old friend

[2:41:43] life he surrendered his heart to the
[2:41:46] Lord and he's just a baby Christian just
[2:41:49] started out but
[2:41:51] he God took away drinking from
[2:41:54] him I took a I took a look at him and
[2:41:58] spoke to him a few minutes I said that's
[2:42:00] a beautiful car you got he said yeah
[2:42:02] that's what you get when you get quit
[2:42:06] drinking said you have things you're
[2:42:12] blessed but you know when a man's out
[2:42:15] there in his mind filled
[2:42:19] and ebbed
[2:42:22] contaminated with the drunkenness of
[2:42:24] this
[2:42:25] world everything
[2:42:28] good he lose sight of
[2:42:33] it what God wants as men in His
[2:42:38] image men that will be real
[2:42:43] fathers men that will
[2:42:46] be supporters of their families
[2:42:50] that will lead them in
[2:42:53] righteousness that will reflect Jesus
[2:43:03] Christ what God wants for a woman is for
[2:43:06] her to be reflecting the Bride of Jesus
[2:43:11] Christ we're right here on the edge of
[2:43:16] Prophecy being fulfilled
[2:43:19] now I I don't know if this one that's
[2:43:22] running now will be that one I can't
[2:43:26] say sure looks like
[2:43:29] it but if she's she's not listen we've
[2:43:33] already had enough years to set our
[2:43:36] nation on the course of
[2:43:40] Destruction but what if she does get
[2:43:42] eight
[2:43:43] years where will we be
[2:43:46] then I don't know I know it happens
[2:43:49] right at the same time that autonomous
[2:43:52] Cars come
[2:43:53] out and we're seeing that and it comes
[2:43:57] out right at the same time that she
[2:44:00] rises in
[2:44:01] [Music]
[2:44:05] power she's prophesied to be
[2:44:11] evil a murderer rule as a queen that's a
[2:44:15] dictator she's prophesied she spoke of I
[2:44:19] you know I went through everything and
[2:44:21] maybe I'll bring it out in another
[2:44:23] another service brought brought through
[2:44:25] everything that brother brandom said
[2:44:26] about it every
[2:44:30] description and we're
[2:44:33] here we're in the
[2:44:38] [Music]
[2:44:44] vision the next thing the next vision is
[2:44:51] destruction well where are
[2:44:54] we do you know we now have in in our
[2:44:58] cabinet a woman that has been placed in
[2:45:02] [Music]
[2:45:07] [Music]
[2:45:09] there and she she wants to feminize the
[2:45:13] nuclear program
[2:45:21] she wants to make it where you know that
[2:45:23] we we lose our strength as a
[2:45:26] nation and that where we're vulnerable
[2:45:29] to the attacks of the
[2:45:31] enemy all in the quest of feeling good
[2:45:34] about
[2:45:35] it running on emotions rather than
[2:45:40] reality what kind of day are we living
[2:45:43] in what is the hour that we're in
[2:45:49] what what what what time is
[2:45:56] it what hour are we
[2:46:00] [Music]
[2:46:02] in when we see all of these things come
[2:46:05] to
[2:46:06] pass don't you
[2:46:09] [Music]
[2:46:11] realize that our only
[2:46:14] hope is to leave
[2:46:17] here are you ready
[2:46:20] let me just sum up whoever this woman
[2:46:24] is she's been prophesied to be vulgar
[2:46:28] immoral she has no Integrity she is a
[2:46:31] liar she's cruel and Wicked at
[2:46:34] heart she would Dominate and Rule as a
[2:46:36] dictator a wicked Queen and make the
[2:46:39] nation go at her
[2:46:40] steps and the nation will literally bow
[2:46:43] to her whims and wishes and by her
[2:46:46] wickedness lies and deception she will
[2:46:49] dominate and overpower her political
[2:46:52] opponents I got all of that that's a
[2:46:56] [Music]
[2:46:58] summary of what the prophet said would
[2:47:02] happen she's going to the nation will
[2:47:04] sink under
[2:47:06] influence as she pollutes our nation's
[2:47:09] Christian values until she causes this
[2:47:12] complete
[2:47:13] ruins and
[2:47:15] collapse and shortly after that
[2:47:19] the United States of America will cease
[2:47:21] to exist her power
[2:47:25] broken her military
[2:47:29] weakened so that our nation suffers
[2:47:31] nuclear destruction it's already been
