[52:03] in a multi-membered body
[52:05] we thank you for that thank you for
[52:06] every healing deliverance
[52:08] thank you for the miracle of salvation
[52:10] lord
[52:11] for the baptism of the holy ghost that
[52:14] empowers us as sons of god
[52:17] we are asking in jesus name
[52:20] amen
[52:21] amen
[52:23] amen thank you
[52:27] if you turn with me to genesis chapter
[52:29] 17 we'll read from verse 5 down to verse
[52:32] 7 then i want to pick up in verse 15.
[52:36] so right now we'll just look at genesis
[52:38] 17
[52:40] 5 and i've just got a couple more
[52:42] services on this and we'll move on
[52:45] but
[52:46] you know i
[52:47] a lot of times um teaching is
[52:49] establishing us in the in the present
[52:52] truth we use sunday morning for that a
[52:54] lot
[52:55] um because um you know wednesday night
[52:58] we usually
[52:59] have um
[53:00] one of our other brothers to minister
[53:03] and many times it's an evangelistic
[53:06] service
[53:07] so um but you know teaching grounds us
[53:09] in the word of god
[53:11] and so we want to be grounded in the
[53:13] scripture in the bible
[53:15] amen we in fact to the matter is we want
[53:18] our bible to be our absolute
[53:20] so that when we point to
[53:22] um any doctrine that we believe that we
[53:25] go back to the bible because that is our
[53:29] absolute
[53:30] genesis 17 verse 5 neither shall thy
[53:33] name any more be called abram but thy
[53:36] name shall be abraham for a father of
[53:38] many nations have i made thee
[53:41] and i will make the exceeding fruitful
[53:43] and i will make
[53:45] nations of thee
[53:47] and kings shall come out of thee and i
[53:49] will establish my covenant between me
[53:52] and thee and thy seed after thee
[53:54] in their generations for an everlasting
[53:57] covenant to be a god unto thee
[53:59] and to thy seed after thee and verse 15
[54:03] and god said unto abraham as far as
[54:05] sarah thy wife thou shalt not call her
[54:08] name sarah sarai but sarah shall be her
[54:12] name shall her name be and i will bless
[54:16] her and give thee a son also of her yea
[54:19] i will bless her and she shall be a
[54:22] mother of nation and kings of people
[54:26] shall be of her
[54:28] amen god bless you can be seated
[54:31] today we're going to be speaking on the
[54:34] children
[54:35] born of el shaddai
[54:38] and um as we speak of these children we
[54:42] are speaking of a bride
[54:44] who is bringing forth christ here upon
[54:47] the earth
[54:48] and manifesting i himself in his power
[54:52] in his glory and
[54:54] producing offspring
[54:57] that is of his that is of his gene
[55:01] amen as we look right here we've got a
[55:04] written up when the bride will get back
[55:07] to being a word bride what's these
[55:09] things a word bright she will produce
[55:12] the very works that jesus produced
[55:16] so you see there is the whole goal is to
[55:19] be a word bride
[55:21] amen to and therefore in this bring
[55:24] forth a people
[55:26] from that who are the children of el
[55:30] shaddai the almighty god
[55:32] now as a bride coming approaches which
[55:34] that's where i believe that we're at
[55:37] we are in the bride coming of christ
[55:40] where that christ will manifest himself
[55:43] completely and fully
[55:45] in bright form and then the rapture will
[55:47] take place
[55:49] and revelation 10 7 tells us that in the
[55:52] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[55:55] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[55:57] of god should be finished
[55:59] in other words the whole counsel of god
[56:03] would be made known
[56:05] and the light would be shown on
[56:07] scripture from genesis to revelation
[56:10] man and that brings us back to the full
[56:14] word into manifestation
[56:17] with the fullness of the word then comes
[56:19] the fullness of the power
[56:21] so therefore you know we cannot expect
[56:24] to walk in for a word without without
[56:26] also
[56:27] anticipating and experiencing
[56:30] the full power of the word
[56:32] now here in genesis 17 we are actually
[56:37] seeing children in type
[56:40] born of el
[56:43] in shaddai
[56:43] words the almighty god was in tight
[56:46] giving birth to sons
[56:49] and this is shown as he names his
[56:52] children we didn't read it but he would
[56:54] also name isaac
[56:56] and uh and and but he would change the
[56:59] name of abram to abraham by putting a
[57:03] letter of his own name into there also
[57:06] he would do the same for sarah because
[57:08] he was showing in type i am coming down
[57:12] into you
[57:14] in type of the baptism of the holy ghost
[57:17] so
[57:18] that you will bring forth an offspring
[57:21] of the supernatural
[57:23] now so this is shown as he names his
[57:25] children and um and names
[57:29] the three of them as abraham sarah and
[57:32] isaac because all of god's children are
[57:36] named by him he has a right to name
[57:40] his own
[57:41] then god gives them their name this
[57:44] shows god as a father giving birth to
[57:47] sons or to children
[57:50] now of course when we're talking about
[57:52] sons we're talking about who we are in
[57:54] christ we are sons of god we are also
[57:57] the bride of christ it all depends on
[58:00] how we're referring to it but it's all
[58:02] the same sons of god amen include all
[58:06] the all men and women who are born of
[58:08] the spirit of god they are the sons of
[58:10] god the bride of christ includes all men
[58:13] and women that are part of that body
[58:15] they are the bride of christ now this is
[58:18] why god refers now to the children of
[58:21] denomination as names of blasphemy
[58:26] they have a name of their mother but not
[58:28] the name of a father
[58:31] if you'll turn with me to revelation 17
[58:34] 3 and he carried me away in the spirit
[58:36] into the wilderness and i saw a woman
[58:39] set up on a scarlet colored beast full
[58:41] of names of blasphemy heaven has seven
[58:45] heads and ten horns now this is symbolic
[58:48] we know that so there are
[58:50] names of blasphemy that that she is full
[58:53] of she's sitting on a scarlet colored
[58:55] beast and it's a woman and verse 5 is
[58:59] said and upon her forehead was the name
[59:01] written
[59:02] mystery babylon the great the mother of
[59:05] harlots and abominations of the earth
[59:08] now this mystery woman whose roots were
[59:12] in pagan babylonian religion is the
[59:15] catholic church
[59:17] and she went whoring and of course she
[59:19] produced offsprings and as she did she
[59:23] became the mother of harlots and these
[59:26] harlots are churches too and her
[59:28] daughters are the protestant
[59:30] denominations that came out of her
[59:33] so you see they're all guilty before god
[59:36] that's why god is calling a bride who
[59:38] will be a virgin to his word
[59:41] you see she claims to be the wife of
[59:44] almighty god but she has taken in the
[59:47] seeds of man through their through their
[59:50] dogmas and creeds and and seminary
[59:53] teachings and everything else mixing and
[59:55] hybridizing the word of god and they
[59:58] enter offspring are illegitimate
[1:00:02] so rather than god naming them he they
[1:00:06] take on the name of an an identification
[1:00:10] for of their rebellion they are actually
[1:00:13] identified
[1:00:14] with their rebellion against their
[1:00:16] mother her mother got so wicked they had
[1:00:19] to leave her
[1:00:20] and so instead of taking on the name of
[1:00:22] christ then you see they take on a name
[1:00:26] from their protest of their mother's
[1:00:28] wickedness
[1:00:30] and although they tried to reform their
[1:00:32] mother they too became a harlot like her
[1:00:35] by again
[1:00:37] when they come to marriage age they
[1:00:40] married a denomination instead
[1:00:43] and and their and their
[1:00:45] take on their own name of baptist and
[1:00:48] methodist and presbyterian episcopalian
[1:00:51] and nazarene or pentecostal and these
[1:00:54] are blasphemous names
[1:00:57] why are they blasphemous names because
[1:00:59] it is blasphemous for the bride the
[1:01:03] church of jesus christ the children of
[1:01:05] god to be called up by any other name
[1:01:08] than the name of jesus christ
[1:01:11] you see they must take on the name of
[1:01:14] their father
[1:01:16] and they're not they're taking on the
[1:01:18] name of their mother because she's a
[1:01:21] headless woman who rejects the word of
[1:01:24] god this is why we're baptized in the
[1:01:27] name of jesus christ
[1:01:29] is because that we are taking on the
[1:01:32] name
[1:01:33] of our savior
[1:01:35] we are walking out identified we have
[1:01:37] now been identified and named after him
[1:01:41] with our new life
[1:01:43] amen now when a child comes from forth
[1:01:46] from el shaddai when the word brings
[1:01:49] forth it you see it will bring forth the
[1:01:51] word in its fullness
[1:01:54] and will be called by his name
[1:01:58] now these are sons
[1:02:00] they are not grandsons
[1:02:03] you see brother branham got a statement
[1:02:05] that he garnered from david duplis who
[1:02:08] was also known
[1:02:10] named mr pentecost and and uh he he was
[1:02:13] a preacher back in the the 60s moved a
[1:02:16] lot of people into the ecumenical
[1:02:18] um circles he actually wound up uniting
[1:02:23] the gospel movement with the catholics
[1:02:26] and so on with the economical move but
[1:02:28] nevertheless you know he realized he
[1:02:32] realized himself as he spoke of it god
[1:02:35] has no grandchildren he realized the
[1:02:39] danger of people coming in the church
[1:02:42] and not getting an experience with god
[1:02:45] therefore becoming grandchildren and i
[1:02:48] wonder today if history is not repeating
[1:02:51] itself
[1:02:52] and see that we see uh that there's not
[1:02:56] and we see that there's again another
[1:02:59] new generation of grandchildren this is
[1:03:02] why we strive so hard to get you to have
[1:03:05] a real genuine holy ghost experience
[1:03:09] with god because you cannot just simply
[1:03:12] accept this message on the basis that's
[1:03:14] where your mom and dad took you to
[1:03:16] church and you were born on the pew
[1:03:18] you've got to have your own experience
[1:03:21] with god and become a child of god
[1:03:24] because god has no grandchildren
[1:03:27] now i'm going to read this excerpt from
[1:03:30] his article because brother branham was
[1:03:32] quoting from it and i i just want to
[1:03:34] share with you just a little bit from it
[1:03:36] where you can kind of see where he was
[1:03:38] coming from when he repeated and used
[1:03:41] brother uh duplicitous statement on god
[1:03:44] has no grandchildren you'll find this in
[1:03:46] a in a full gospel businessman's voice
[1:03:50] magazine but in his article he he said
[1:03:53] every gentile that came into the
[1:03:56] christian church did so by repentance or
[1:03:59] conversion or being born of the spirit
[1:04:02] everyone had a definite very definite
[1:04:05] encounter with the living christ the
[1:04:07] resurrected son of god this record in
[1:04:10] acts also shows that they received the
[1:04:14] holy spirit and of this paul was so sure
[1:04:17] that when he met the disciples at
[1:04:20] ephesus he asked him have you received
[1:04:22] the holy ghost since you believed
[1:04:24] this revival continued and the church
[1:04:26] grew and christianity swept the world of
[1:04:29] that time then some jew or some gentile
[1:04:33] begin to reason i was a jew or a gentile
[1:04:37] whichever the case and became a
[1:04:39] christian by repentance for sin and
[1:04:41] conversion from judaism or paganism
[1:04:44] again whatever the case was and so is my
[1:04:47] wife but this boy of mine he's never
[1:04:50] been a jew he's never been a pagan he
[1:04:53] didn't grow up in the temple he was born
[1:04:56] from christian parents in a christian
[1:04:58] home and was brought up in a christian
[1:05:01] church he is born a christian
[1:05:05] now this may be all true
[1:05:08] but he has never been born of the spirit
[1:05:12] and that child is not repented as a
[1:05:15] sinner because he has had a strict
[1:05:18] training as the son of christian parents
[1:05:24] he was taught to try and live like a
[1:05:27] christian
[1:05:28] for he is the son of god's children
[1:05:31] the nicest thing you could say about him
[1:05:34] is that being the son of two of god's
[1:05:36] children who became a son or daughter of
[1:05:39] god by regeneration he is now a grandson
[1:05:43] of god
[1:05:44] but there it is god has no grandsons so
[1:05:48] gradually the early church began to
[1:05:50] accept members into their churches
[1:05:53] their well-trained but unregenerated
[1:05:56] children until the pews were packed with
[1:06:00] members that had no encounter with
[1:06:02] christ as savior and much less a
[1:06:05] pentecostal experience
[1:06:07] they were not born of the spirit
[1:06:09] therefore it could not be filled with
[1:06:11] the spirit god said it's not by power
[1:06:13] nor by might nor by but by my spirit the
[1:06:16] spirit found no more blood cleansed
[1:06:18] hearts in the church to dwell in and the
[1:06:20] church cooled off spiritually until even
[1:06:24] in the pulpit
[1:06:26] stood unregenerated
[1:06:28] but well-trained preachers
[1:06:31] that spoke the letter but had not the
[1:06:34] spirit
[1:06:36] when emperor constantine caused his
[1:06:38] whole army to be baptized into the
[1:06:41] church
[1:06:42] the church was so already dead with a
[1:06:45] generation of unregenerated
[1:06:48] grandsons that these sinful soldiers
[1:06:52] fell right at home in the christian
[1:06:55] society
[1:06:56] spiritually the church was dead
[1:06:59] but god didn't leave it at that time and
[1:07:01] time again the holy spirit found a heart
[1:07:03] through which he could reach the ears of
[1:07:05] the people and such men were the
[1:07:07] exception and were looked upon as
[1:07:09] fanatics
[1:07:10] and usually they were persecuted or
[1:07:13] martyred and there came for instance
[1:07:15] martin luther and out of his ministry
[1:07:17] came to reformation and there seemed to
[1:07:19] come into
[1:07:21] and there seemed to come into life a new
[1:07:23] church with membership that had a fresh
[1:07:26] and very real encounter with christ
[1:07:29] and with the holy spirit but however it
[1:07:31] was not long before
[1:07:33] some of the lutheran parents begin to
[1:07:36] reason and say but our children have
[1:07:39] never been born roman catholics and they
[1:07:42] have never been born lutherans and right
[1:07:44] there was it began again
[1:07:47] grandsons forgot in the lutheran
[1:07:49] reformation churches
[1:07:51] then john wesley in england we had a
[1:07:53] wesley revival when he came and again
[1:07:56] men and women were challenged to seek
[1:07:58] god and be born in the spirit but after
[1:08:00] two or three generations some parents
[1:08:03] began to reason our children have never
[1:08:05] been anglicans or lutherans our roman
[1:08:09] catholics they're born wesleyans are
[1:08:12] methodists and soon grandsons filled the
[1:08:15] church and the revival is over
[1:08:19] so now you look at the condition of that
[1:08:21] church what do you have in that church
[1:08:24] you have sin of every kind
[1:08:28] things that are against the bible the
[1:08:29] word of god and then he said now at the
[1:08:32] very turn of this century came the
[1:08:34] pentecostal revival and all we're called
[1:08:37] to repentance and everyone that was born
[1:08:39] of the spirit was now encouraged to seek
[1:08:42] and receive the baptism in the spirit
[1:08:44] with the new testament evidence of
[1:08:46] speaking in tongues remember this is a
[1:08:48] pentecostal writing this with
[1:08:50] manifestations of the holy spirit such
[1:08:52] as prophecy and healing no matter how
[1:08:55] the older churches objected the revival
[1:08:57] spread it was the same in catholic
[1:08:59] countries as protestant countries and
[1:09:02] and in pagan lands and when people are
[1:09:04] born of the spirit
[1:09:06] they live
[1:09:08] and when such people are filled with the
[1:09:09] spirit they receive power to become
[1:09:11] witnesses
[1:09:13] but what is happening now we find that
[1:09:15] in the beginning this revival 50 years
[1:09:17] ago everyone was expected to be filled
[1:09:20] with the spirit with the confirmation of
[1:09:22] tongues before they could hold any
[1:09:24] office in a pentecostal church or a
[1:09:25] pentecostal assembly but today the sons
[1:09:28] and grandsons of pentecostal pioneers
[1:09:32] who are teaching in sunday school and
[1:09:34] holding all kinds of offices in the
[1:09:36] local church without ever having a real
[1:09:39] baptism of the spirit according to acts
[1:09:41] 2 and 4. these waves the waves of
[1:09:44] pentecost of power and revival are
[1:09:46] receding fast there is no there is a
[1:09:50] danger that in another generation we may
[1:09:53] be just a pentecostal movement
[1:09:56] without pentecost
[1:09:59] and that is without the experience but
[1:10:01] still holding to the letter
[1:10:04] the doctrine just like the other revival
[1:10:07] still emphasize some other some other
[1:10:10] truth but
[1:10:12] never experience it revivals crystallize
[1:10:15] into societies and and establish
[1:10:18] churches when grandsons take over but
[1:10:21] god has no grandsons
[1:10:26] now brother branham would quote him like
[1:10:29] this for example in the message why in
[1:10:32] hot springs in 63 as david duplessis
[1:10:35] once said god don't have no
[1:10:37] grandchildren that's right where our
[1:10:39] pentecostal brothers are becoming their
[1:10:42] children come into church and just say
[1:10:44] well we're pentecostal because papa was
[1:10:47] if papa was a pentecostal got the
[1:10:49] baptism of the holy ghost you'll have to
[1:10:51] get it the same way papa did he don't
[1:10:53] have grandchildren he just has sons and
[1:10:55] daughters not grandsons and
[1:10:57] granddaughters just sons and daughters
[1:11:00] is true so you've got to do the same
[1:11:02] thing they did on the day of pentecost
[1:11:05] you got to have the same experience
[1:11:08] you've got to have the same thing they
[1:11:10] had god don't never change his program
[1:11:13] he never changes his ways he just does
[1:11:17] the same thing all the time the way he
[1:11:20] lays down his program it must toe to
[1:11:22] that each time
[1:11:24] it's got to be the same thing and if you
[1:11:27] will do the same thing the same results
[1:11:30] will come
[1:11:31] amen so again in question answer 64 he
[1:11:35] has answers a question in his own church
[1:11:38] do your children have to have an
[1:11:40] experience with the holy ghost or to
[1:11:42] have the holy ghost or holy spirit if
[1:11:45] they see the end time message do they
[1:11:48] have the holy spirit
[1:11:50] now this is what is commonly thought
[1:11:52] today if they see
[1:11:55] the end time message they already got it
[1:12:00] and he he replies to this question
[1:12:03] everyone must have an experience
[1:12:06] your children cannot go in on no other
[1:12:09] way but the same way you do they've got
[1:12:12] to be born again there's no
[1:12:14] grandchildren in the kingdom of god
[1:12:17] they're all children they must have it
[1:12:19] you must have an experience with god to
[1:12:21] go in just the same as you
[1:12:26] so
[1:12:27] you know
[1:12:28] we we're living in a very hour of
[1:12:31] deception
[1:12:33] where that the devil is doing everything
[1:12:36] to destroy the children
[1:12:39] amen
[1:12:40] amen
[1:12:41] amen they've set it up in schools
[1:12:44] they've set it up in colleges
[1:12:46] to do the same thing they did in the
[1:12:48] days of moses to try to kill the
[1:12:50] children as soon as they're born
[1:12:52] they want to wipe god out of their lives
[1:12:55] out of their mind they want to reason it
[1:12:58] out
[1:12:59] and turn them into a bunch of
[1:13:02] of reprobates
[1:13:04] amen now you know you know the first
[1:13:07] seed was the early church that was a
[1:13:10] mature grain
[1:13:11] that could have been raptured but were
[1:13:14] sown as a seed
[1:13:16] for an end-time crop
[1:13:19] amen so that sea church went in the
[1:13:21] ground and it began to decay and and
[1:13:25] part of that decay was men not getting
[1:13:28] the same experience and this and having
[1:13:30] the same vision that the early fathers
[1:13:33] had
[1:13:34] and jude was warning before the age
[1:13:36] would even end you know let us earnestly
[1:13:39] contend
[1:13:40] for the faith that was once delivered to
[1:13:43] the saints
[1:13:45] now
[1:13:46] you know this this was even in that age
[1:13:49] he was seeing a cooling off
[1:13:52] because the church was decayed
[1:13:56] but i want you to know this church is
[1:13:58] not to go down in decay
[1:14:01] it is not being planted
[1:14:04] it is predestined for a rapture
[1:14:08] hallelujah so there's going to be a
[1:14:10] grain taken a rapture that has no decay
[1:14:13] in it
[1:14:14] [Applause]
[1:14:19] i'd like you to
[1:14:21] look at some of the problems in the
[1:14:23] early church
[1:14:24] acts chapter 15 and verse 1.
[1:14:26] and we're not going to read the whole
[1:14:28] chapter but you could and certain men
[1:14:30] which came down from judea taught the
[1:14:33] brethren
[1:14:34] except to be circumcised after the
[1:14:37] manner of moses you cannot be saved
[1:14:41] now i want you to notice this they were
[1:14:44] bringing the messages of the age past
[1:14:48] it would be like
[1:14:50] someone standing and saying well you
[1:14:52] know if you believe the message you got
[1:14:54] the holy ghost
[1:15:00] because why that was the message of the
[1:15:02] evangelicals or reformers
[1:15:05] just be baptized and believe on christ
[1:15:07] and you got it
[1:15:10] amen or it would be like someone come
[1:15:12] and say well you got to speak in tongues
[1:15:14] to get the holy ghost
[1:15:17] because what they are drawing from their
[1:15:20] past
[1:15:22] i'm glad i don't have a pass to draw
[1:15:25] from
[1:15:25] except what was in god's mind before the
[1:15:28] foundation of the world
[1:15:30] say brother tim you preached like you do
[1:15:32] because you were at pentecost i was born
[1:15:34] again in this message i've never
[1:15:36] preached anything but this message
[1:15:41] amen i've never been schooled in any of
[1:15:44] their teachings
[1:15:46] amen my schooling that i have received
[1:15:48] is from the message of the hour
[1:15:51] amen with this transforming power that's
[1:15:54] where i got the holy ghost
[1:15:58] amen
[1:15:59] in acts 15 and 5
[1:16:01] but there rose up
[1:16:04] a certain of the sect of the pharisees
[1:16:06] which believed
[1:16:08] saying that it was needful to circumcise
[1:16:10] them and command them to keep the law of
[1:16:12] moses
[1:16:13] now this was a law men couldn't keep on
[1:16:15] their own
[1:16:16] this was circumstance
[1:16:18] circumcision that was to no avail
[1:16:21] because now it had been fulfilled
[1:16:24] by the circumcision of the heart
[1:16:27] you may circumcise the flesh all you
[1:16:29] want to
[1:16:30] in the foreskin of the flesh that don't
[1:16:32] save you don't leave the circumcision of
[1:16:34] the heart
[1:16:35] so a corner had been turned
[1:16:38] but i want you to know that there were
[1:16:41] certain other set of pharisees which
[1:16:44] believed
[1:16:47] now my question has always been why were
[1:16:50] there still pharisees within the church
[1:16:57] if they had got the new birth they would
[1:16:59] have no longer been a pharisee
[1:17:03] they would have no longer been trying to
[1:17:05] bring the message of an age past
[1:17:07] circumcision was all right up to the day
[1:17:09] jesus died
[1:17:15] so why were they still pharisees
[1:17:18] they had missed a new birth
[1:17:21] they had missed the holy ghost
[1:17:24] that's why they were still pharisees and
[1:17:26] this is why we're having problems today
[1:17:28] even in the around the ranks the message
[1:17:30] we still got people are a baptist or
[1:17:32] lutheran or whatever they'll say what
[1:17:34] came in and they try to hybridize the
[1:17:36] message
[1:17:39] with their past
[1:17:41] and you can't mix it
[1:17:43] that was good for that time
[1:17:46] but it's not good today
[1:17:49] amen look paul paul would say of himself
[1:17:52] he said look i was a pharisee listen
[1:17:55] philippians 3 and 5 i was circumcised
[1:17:57] the eighth day of the stock of israel of
[1:17:59] the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of the
[1:18:01] hebrew it's touching the law of pharisee
[1:18:05] verse seven but what things were gained
[1:18:08] to me
[1:18:09] those i counted lost for christ
[1:18:12] yea doubtless i counted all things as lo
[1:18:15] but lost for the excellency of the
[1:18:17] knowledge of christ jesus my lord for
[1:18:20] whom i've suffered the loss of all
[1:18:22] things and to count them as
[1:18:24] done that i might win christ
[1:18:28] you see this is a reflection of a new
[1:18:31] birth of a real baptism of the holy
[1:18:33] ghost that washes you from the sins of
[1:18:37] the of the wickedness of false doctrines
[1:18:40] of the past
[1:18:42] amen but you know there are still those
[1:18:45] who
[1:18:46] who are still
[1:18:47] evangelical in their beliefs they have
[1:18:49] an easy believism
[1:18:51] a easy believism mentality they've been
[1:18:53] brought over as an unconverted pharisee
[1:18:56] from baptist methodist presbyterian
[1:18:58] saying the baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:19:01] not an experience just accept the
[1:19:03] message and you got it
[1:19:07] this is why that he would say to that
[1:19:10] first age revelation two and four
[1:19:13] nevertheless i have somewhat against
[1:19:15] thee because thou has left thy first
[1:19:18] love
[1:19:21] now again you see it wasn't the children
[1:19:24] losing it it was the grandchildren
[1:19:28] the church he's talking to
[1:19:30] the church now
[1:19:32] in general has now lost that first
[1:19:35] passion
[1:19:37] that verse
[1:19:39] igniting of the spirit
[1:19:41] that real experience with god they've
[1:19:44] lost it
[1:19:46] see what the devil wants to do to us
[1:19:48] children take away that from us
[1:19:52] take that away
[1:19:53] remove it from us just have a bunch of
[1:19:55] grandkids in the church
[1:19:57] that are grandfathered into the church
[1:20:00] you know can do anything and live any
[1:20:02] kind of life
[1:20:03] listen the very name ephesus has a
[1:20:06] strange compound meaning it means aimed
[1:20:09] at and relaxed you see they aimed at the
[1:20:12] high calling because when they had high
[1:20:14] aspirations at the beginning of this age
[1:20:18] that it began with the fullness of the
[1:20:20] spirit
[1:20:21] and then in before it was the depth of
[1:20:24] god and i tell you that's what god left
[1:20:27] us with with a message
[1:20:30] come on church that was the depths of
[1:20:32] god
[1:20:34] amen and we began with full aspiration
[1:20:37] you know we're going to be everything
[1:20:39] that word said we could be
[1:20:44] but then while
[1:20:46] they begin to give way to a less
[1:20:49] watchful attitude
[1:20:52] a less ardent following of jesus christ
[1:20:55] began to manifest itself as an omen
[1:20:58] that the future ages
[1:21:00] in the future ages the physical vehicle
[1:21:03] called the church would sink to the
[1:21:05] awfulness of the depth of satan
[1:21:08] amen
[1:21:10] actually what i read to you about
[1:21:12] was the church that started on the day
[1:21:14] of pentecost
[1:21:17] that decayed
[1:21:19] into a catholic church
[1:21:24] come on
[1:21:25] amen they they they want to say we were
[1:21:27] the original they started out but then
[1:21:31] brought in grandchildren
[1:21:35] men without the same vision without the
[1:21:38] same passion without the same experience
[1:21:42] that brings that passion
[1:21:44] and they're lost because they had aimed
[1:21:47] at the high calling and relaxed
[1:21:49] brother we have aimed at a rapture
[1:21:52] we've aimed at the chains of the body
[1:21:55] we've aimed at the fullness of his power
[1:21:58] don't let go of it
[1:22:01] [Applause]
[1:22:06] you see
[1:22:08] it become relaxed and drifting
[1:22:12] it left his first love
[1:22:14] the tiny seed planted in the feast and
[1:22:16] age would one that grow into a spirit of
[1:22:19] era until all the foul birds are there
[1:22:21] i'm quoting from the church book you
[1:22:23] know
[1:22:24] who would roost in its branches
[1:22:27] so inoffensive to human reasoning would
[1:22:29] be that little plant would appear to
[1:22:32] that new eat
[1:22:34] the new church and again she would be
[1:22:36] deceived by satan
[1:22:39] and the fees and age had presented to
[1:22:41] her the
[1:22:42] opportunity for god's best and after for
[1:22:45] a while she prevailed and then she
[1:22:47] relaxed and in that unguarded moment
[1:22:50] satan planted the seed of complete
[1:22:52] ruination
[1:22:55] you know you say well brother tim how
[1:22:57] could the catholic church be be there in
[1:23:00] the book of acts i just read it to you
[1:23:02] from acts
[1:23:04] 15. that's right
[1:23:06] it was men that come in without getting
[1:23:09] that same experience
[1:23:12] and the first thing you know here it's
[1:23:15] it's like a vine you know the false vine
[1:23:18] twisting itself around the real plant
[1:23:24] now
[1:23:25] he would come down to say i have
[1:23:27] somewhat against you you left us first
[1:23:29] your first love he said now to realize
[1:23:31] this
[1:23:32] to understand this you must realize the
[1:23:34] spirit is not speaking to the original
[1:23:36] saints of ephesus alone this message is
[1:23:39] to the entire age which lasted about 120
[1:23:42] years its message then is to all
[1:23:44] generations in that span
[1:23:47] now history keeps repeating itself
[1:23:50] and in the generations of israel
[1:23:53] we see the revival in one generation
[1:23:57] only to see the fires fading in the next
[1:23:59] in the third generation's embers may be
[1:24:02] glowing slightly but in the fourth there
[1:24:04] may be no vestige water whatsoever of
[1:24:07] the original flame then god lights the
[1:24:10] fire again and the same process is
[1:24:12] repeated
[1:24:13] it's simply the manifestation of the
[1:24:16] truth that god has no grandchildren he's
[1:24:20] still again quoting david duplicious
[1:24:22] saints salvation is not passed on by
[1:24:25] natural birth you start out with
[1:24:27] truly born again believers and when the
[1:24:30] next generation comes along they are no
[1:24:33] longer just plain christians but they're
[1:24:34] taking on a denominational name and are
[1:24:37] now baptist methods and so forth this
[1:24:39] that is exactly what they are to they
[1:24:41] are not christian
[1:24:43] you have to be born of the of the will
[1:24:45] of god not the will of man to be saved
[1:24:47] but these folks are coming together not
[1:24:50] by the will of man and i don't say that
[1:24:52] some of them aren't right with god not
[1:24:53] to a minute do i say that but the
[1:24:55] original fire has died down they're not
[1:24:59] the same anymore
[1:25:02] and i i just want to say that there's
[1:25:04] still maybe good people out there in
[1:25:06] that we're not we're not castigating
[1:25:08] them or condemning them we're just
[1:25:10] saying that the original fire has gone
[1:25:13] down
[1:25:15] they lose their passion and that passion
[1:25:18] is one of the greatest evidences
[1:25:21] of a spirit-filled
[1:25:23] church
[1:25:27] i want that to sink
[1:25:30] amen they lose their passion and that
[1:25:33] passion is one of the greatest evidences
[1:25:37] of a spirit-filled church
[1:25:42] that fervent desire to please god
[1:25:44] the passion to know his word the cry for
[1:25:47] reaching out in the spirit
[1:25:49] it all begins to fade
[1:25:52] and instead of that church being on fire
[1:25:55] with the fire god it cools off and it's
[1:25:58] become a bit formal
[1:26:01] and that was what was happening back in
[1:26:02] ephesus
[1:26:04] they were getting a little bit farmer
[1:26:06] formal the abandonment to god was dying
[1:26:08] now people weren't too careful about
[1:26:10] what god taught them as they began to be
[1:26:12] careful about what the world thought of
[1:26:14] them that second generation coming on
[1:26:16] was just like israel they demanded the
[1:26:18] king to be like other nations when they
[1:26:21] did that they rejected god but they did
[1:26:23] it anyway that's the history of the
[1:26:25] church when it thinks more of conforming
[1:26:27] to the world instead of conforming to
[1:26:29] god it isn't long until you see them
[1:26:32] stop doing things that used to do and
[1:26:34] start doing things they wouldn't do
[1:26:36] initially
[1:26:37] and
[1:26:38] and they changed their manner of dress
[1:26:42] their attitudes and their behavior
[1:26:45] they get lacks
[1:26:48] that's what ephesus means relaxed and
[1:26:51] drifting
[1:26:52] so the cycle of revival and death has
[1:26:55] never failed
[1:26:57] but i'm telling you today
[1:27:00] that there are going to be a people
[1:27:02] could i say unto you there is a people
[1:27:06] that is going to break that cycle
[1:27:09] where the rest of them had revival and
[1:27:12] death there is a people leaving out of
[1:27:14] here within revival
[1:27:17] still have a passion
[1:27:19] they'll still have a drive within them
[1:27:24] they still have an ambition to see the
[1:27:27] word
[1:27:28] reign and preeminence
[1:27:31] all you have to do is recall this last
[1:27:33] move of god and he's referring back now
[1:27:35] to the pentecostals
[1:27:36] the last move of god in the spirit when
[1:27:39] men and women dress like christians that
[1:27:41] went to church prayed all night took to
[1:27:43] the street corners wasn't ashamed of the
[1:27:45] manifestations of the spirit
[1:27:48] they left their old dead churches and
[1:27:50] worshiped in homes or old store
[1:27:51] buildings they had reality but it wasn't
[1:27:53] too long a time until they began to get
[1:27:56] enough enough money to build find new
[1:27:58] churches
[1:28:01] and they put in a choir instead of
[1:28:03] singing them to god from zeal now
[1:28:04] brother branham built his own self a new
[1:28:06] church he also had choirs
[1:28:09] that's not what he's talking about he's
[1:28:10] talking about how what they did as they
[1:28:13] began to move out because in indebting
[1:28:16] the church
[1:28:18] it made them to have to compromise
[1:28:22] for membership
[1:28:24] i dare not preach on this i lose that
[1:28:26] one and we got this note to pay and you
[1:28:28] know i don't want to offend so-and-so
[1:28:32] that's why this church has always been
[1:28:34] debt-free because i will not be enslaved
[1:28:37] to anyone
[1:28:40] amen that's why we paid cash for every
[1:28:43] building because we won't be obligated
[1:28:45] to nobody
[1:28:47] nobody will pull the strings of this
[1:28:49] ministry
[1:28:50] we'll preach what god put on our heart
[1:28:53] we'll proclaim the word of god
[1:28:56] we will do it without fear or favor
[1:29:01] but he said you know they organized the
[1:29:04] movement and ran it by man and soon to
[1:29:06] begin to read books that weren't fit to
[1:29:08] read they left down the bars and goats
[1:29:11] came in and took over and the cry of joy
[1:29:13] was gone
[1:29:16] and the freedom of the spirit was gone
[1:29:17] am i talking to some of these message
[1:29:20] churches today i think i am
[1:29:22] amen oh they kept on with the thorn
[1:29:26] but the fire had died down and the
[1:29:28] blackness of ashes is all about that is
[1:29:31] left
[1:29:34] but you see this is a word born bride
[1:29:37] she's not a harlot
[1:29:39] she's a virgin to the word and she has
[1:29:41] precious virtues
[1:29:43] and that virtue is to reproduce christ
[1:29:46] to bring forth sons
[1:29:48] and daughters of god word sons who the
[1:29:52] signs follow
[1:29:54] word sons that are endowed with gifts
[1:29:58] word sons that have his power
[1:30:01] they look like him they talk like him
[1:30:04] they believe like him they cast out
[1:30:07] devils like him they feel like him they
[1:30:11] are in his image and in his likeness
[1:30:16] and the church
[1:30:17] has been entrusted to bring forth his
[1:30:20] children
[1:30:22] remember brother madam tells us this an
[1:30:24] invisible union is a sermon that he
[1:30:27] would have preached in his own church
[1:30:29] but he didn't have time he was running
[1:30:31] out of time and he said i've got to
[1:30:32] preach this important message here at
[1:30:35] life tabernacle i have to be present in
[1:30:38] that service when many people walked out
[1:30:42] because of what he was preaching
[1:30:44] what of sacred trust
[1:30:47] what a responsibility to a woman
[1:30:50] see why she's a type of the church which
[1:30:53] has the same responsibility as a woman
[1:30:56] as a sacred responsibility to her
[1:30:58] motherhood
[1:31:00] to her virtues to her husband
[1:31:03] the church has the same sacred
[1:31:05] responsibility to prayer and to the word
[1:31:09] and to christ
[1:31:10] and christ is the anointing
[1:31:15] just the same as a woman has
[1:31:17] responsibilities the church has sacred
[1:31:19] responsibilities
[1:31:22] she is a type she
[1:31:24] has the same precious virtues by spirit
[1:31:27] given to her to preserve the spirit and
[1:31:31] the word notice what not just preserve
[1:31:34] the word
[1:31:35] and the doctrine but preserve the spirit
[1:31:38] and the word
[1:31:40] and never commit adultery with anything
[1:31:42] in the world stay virgin to the word as
[1:31:46] a woman is to say virtuster husband it's
[1:31:48] a sacred trust to honor her lord's word
[1:31:52] above every man-made creed wisdom
[1:31:56] denomination there is the church is
[1:31:58] given that trust
[1:32:01] now i want you to watch what the trust
[1:32:03] is
[1:32:04] if they say
[1:32:06] well my church
[1:32:08] he said i don't care what your church
[1:32:11] believes it is contrary to the word stay
[1:32:14] away from it
[1:32:16] then he explains and emphasizes what he
[1:32:19] means the bible said jesus christ is the
[1:32:23] same yesterday today and forever
[1:32:25] mark 16 said these signs shall follow
[1:32:28] them that believe
[1:32:30] if a church preaches different from that
[1:32:34] don't you you die to that thing
[1:32:37] be born again into the word of god go
[1:32:40] into all the world preach the gospel to
[1:32:41] every creature that's how far it was to
[1:32:43] go these signs shall follow them that
[1:32:46] believe in all the world and every
[1:32:48] creature that will believe see how we've
[1:32:50] got away from it
[1:32:52] but she's responsible for it think about
[1:32:55] it we and even like tabernacle are to be
[1:32:58] a chaste virgin to god
[1:33:00] and preserve the word and the spirit
[1:33:04] amen and the church is responsible to
[1:33:08] motherhood
[1:33:10] to bring forth offspring of el salvador
[1:33:15] amen
[1:33:16] not offspring of the church
[1:33:20] because that's grandchildren offspring
[1:33:22] of el shaddai
[1:33:24] the almighty
[1:33:26] you see that the church is bringing
[1:33:28] forth children but what kind of children
[1:33:32] you see brother branham said she's
[1:33:34] impregnated with something
[1:33:37] and it's cause she's bringing forth
[1:33:38] members all the time
[1:33:40] but she don't want any of them screaming
[1:33:43] hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable
[1:33:45] creatures she thinks they are it was
[1:33:48] certainly
[1:33:49] her it would ruin her and her educated
[1:33:52] ethical scientific society church that
[1:33:54] she belongs to here they would throw her
[1:33:57] out at the next council that she can't
[1:33:59] have it so she don't want to be
[1:34:01] impregnated with the word because that's
[1:34:04] the only kind
[1:34:06] that the word can bring forth born of
[1:34:09] the spirit of god it has the spirit of
[1:34:11] god in it no intellectual church joined
[1:34:14] creed going bob hair painted faith
[1:34:16] there's no such a thing as that at all
[1:34:19] you don't find that in the word of god
[1:34:21] you find an old-fashioned sanctified
[1:34:24] holy ghost-filled child born of the
[1:34:27] spirit of god screaming hollering
[1:34:30] shouting praising god
[1:34:32] [Applause]
[1:34:33] hallelujah
[1:34:34] amen and another thing notice what kind
[1:34:37] of children should bear that tells what
[1:34:39] their papa is whether it's the first
[1:34:41] adam or the second adam if the church
[1:34:44] brings forth the child of the second
[1:34:46] item he acts the second adam's way of
[1:34:49] acting like they did on the day of
[1:34:51] pentecost that is a really true
[1:34:54] second adam's children
[1:34:58] amen
[1:35:00] look at the trouble we're having in our
[1:35:02] land
[1:35:03] look at the supreme court of our land
[1:35:06] has had to have to have has actually had
[1:35:09] to tell women that not to kill their
[1:35:11] babies can you imagine the insanity
[1:35:14] can you imagine they have cast down roe
[1:35:16] versus wade and
[1:35:18] and women are now rioting in the street
[1:35:22] screaming
[1:35:24] demanding the right
[1:35:26] to kill their children
[1:35:30] and their pennywise men are right behind
[1:35:33] them screaming and they're all saying
[1:35:35] it's my body
[1:35:36] it's the woman's rights
[1:35:43] and preachers are in the pulpit
[1:35:45] screaming we don't want live-borne
[1:35:47] children
[1:35:49] kill them in the womb
[1:35:51] let them be still born instead of acts
[1:35:53] 238 saudi blabbering screaming tongue
[1:35:56] talking children we don't want no such
[1:35:58] thing we don't want live children
[1:36:01] we want a dead dead dead dead
[1:36:10] amen
[1:36:12] listen we all believe the word you know
[1:36:14] we wanna and if we believe all the word
[1:36:17] we want all the spirit
[1:36:22] hallelujah now there is a true church
[1:36:26] that will bring forth children that will
[1:36:29] nurse oh now shed eye on almighty god as
[1:36:32] brother joe pointed out there's 8 810
[1:36:35] promises
[1:36:37] lay in there
[1:36:39] for you there's enough vitamins for
[1:36:41] healing
[1:36:42] not vitamins to
[1:36:44] destroy every spirit of the enemy enough
[1:36:47] antibiotics in it to deal with
[1:36:49] pornography and sin and sex sin and
[1:36:53] habits of the word come on
[1:36:55] there's enough power in it
[1:36:58] to energize a person to give them power
[1:37:01] over sin and gladness
[1:37:06] so there has to be a true church
[1:37:08] that will nurse
[1:37:10] from el salvador
[1:37:12] and the nurse from both sides
[1:37:14] loved that song they sang just a minute
[1:37:16] ago
[1:37:17] amen you see they nurse from both sides
[1:37:21] from
[1:37:22] because the god of the old is the god of
[1:37:24] the new
[1:37:25] come on somebody help me preach
[1:37:28] amen the jehovah the old testament is
[1:37:30] the jesus of the new
[1:37:32] so they mercy from both sides they are
[1:37:35] balanced
[1:37:36] both word and spirit drink it from both
[1:37:39] sides word and spirit they're not
[1:37:42] deniers of the word and they're not
[1:37:44] deniers of the spirit
[1:37:47] all the word
[1:37:49] yes
[1:37:51] we believe in this
[1:37:52] all the word
[1:37:55] all the word
[1:37:58] when we get back to being a word bride
[1:38:01] all the word
[1:38:04] you see
[1:38:06] so we believe
[1:38:08] in his personal presence
[1:38:12] we believe
[1:38:14] in the seven thunders and the revelation
[1:38:16] that was given
[1:38:19] we believe that not some of the book is
[1:38:21] open we believe every promise of god is
[1:38:24] open to us
[1:38:26] that all the book is open
[1:38:28] we believe in the mystery truths
[1:38:30] but we believe in healing
[1:38:33] and we believe in miracles we believe in
[1:38:36] holiness
[1:38:37] and we believe in gifts of the spirit we
[1:38:40] believe it all
[1:38:41] and that's the bride a people who
[1:38:44] believes it all
[1:38:45] [Applause]
[1:38:52] brother branham would say there's only
[1:38:54] one evidence of the spirit i know of and
[1:38:56] that's a genuine faith in the promised
[1:38:58] word of god and he promises it all
[1:39:02] everything from our healing to our
[1:39:04] salvation
[1:39:06] and there
[1:39:07] and there is altar calls
[1:39:10] amen come on and there's prayer lines
[1:39:14] i don't see no prayer line in the bible
[1:39:15] well what do you think they did
[1:39:18] one come up for prayer for jesus for
[1:39:20] jesus to pray for him another got behind
[1:39:22] him for his turn next one got behind
[1:39:24] that one
[1:39:26] we still believe in prayer lines because
[1:39:28] we believe in casting out devils
[1:39:31] and notice here the promised word of
[1:39:35] malachi 4 turns our heart back to the
[1:39:38] faith of the pentecostal fathers
[1:39:42] because brother branham would see her by
[1:39:44] vision
[1:39:45] and he would see her coming out that
[1:39:48] virtuous woman and step with the word
[1:39:50] then he would see her degenerate into uh
[1:39:53] awful women all the way down into miss
[1:39:56] america and then if i finally see that
[1:39:58] same bride come back again
[1:40:02] and he said what is it she should be the
[1:40:04] same bride the same kind built under the
[1:40:07] same kind of material that she was in
[1:40:09] the first place he said now read malachi
[1:40:12] 4 and see if we're not to have a message
[1:40:14] in the last day that had turned the
[1:40:16] hearts of the children back to the
[1:40:18] fathers back to the original pentecostal
[1:40:21] message word by word
[1:40:25] and he says brothers we are here
[1:40:30] and i want to say we're here
[1:40:34] we have been turned back
[1:40:38] listen the spirit of god
[1:40:40] will make you believe the message
[1:40:43] but everything that professes to believe
[1:40:46] doesn't have the spirit
[1:40:50] the same is true
[1:40:52] the the spirit of god will cause you to
[1:40:55] shout or speak with tongues or dance in
[1:40:57] the spirit but everything that speaks in
[1:40:59] tongues or dances and shouts
[1:41:02] isn't the holy ghost
[1:41:06] and brother branham would deal with this
[1:41:09] when he's dealing with the passion
[1:41:11] notice he would tell about uh in ezekiel
[1:41:15] how that ezekiel would see the holy
[1:41:18] spirit going forth with a um with a
[1:41:22] with uh an ink horn and marking those
[1:41:25] who sighed and cried for the
[1:41:27] abominations that were done in the city
[1:41:32] and let me just say before we go on we
[1:41:34] we can talk about sin you know it's
[1:41:36] abomination we should be crying about
[1:41:38] all these children being aborted and we
[1:41:40] should cry about our laws you know being
[1:41:43] being
[1:41:44] abused and stealing and robbing and and
[1:41:47] raping and everything and we should cry
[1:41:48] but i tell you we all also be crying
[1:41:52] because the word of god is not being
[1:41:53] given preeminence
[1:41:57] because faith isn't in the church
[1:41:59] to heal the sick
[1:42:01] and there ain't enough there isn't
[1:42:03] enough of the atmosphere of the holy
[1:42:05] ghost to birth the sun
[1:42:08] them are abominations
[1:42:14] listen jesus has nothing but sheep i'm
[1:42:17] quoting from brother branham in question
[1:42:18] answer 54 10 years later he picks up
[1:42:21] this same thing he never changes in this
[1:42:24] he says
[1:42:26] the shepherd knows his sheep anyone here
[1:42:28] anybody in here ever hear a goat cry
[1:42:31] brother you better be a shepherd if you
[1:42:33] want to know the difference a goat will
[1:42:34] cry just exactly like a sheep on huh
[1:42:37] let an old billy go get hung up out
[1:42:39] there and little sheep going
[1:42:41] on one side going bye bye they sound the
[1:42:44] same he said i've heard them down the
[1:42:46] altar
[1:42:47] just to crying and crying oh god sobbing
[1:42:50] away like that oh god and a goat all the
[1:42:53] time
[1:42:54] that's right shouting i've seen them
[1:42:56] shout just as uh until they've run
[1:42:58] across the floor and jump up and down
[1:43:00] the shout
[1:43:01] now you say brother branham you don't
[1:43:02] believe in crying don't take me wrong
[1:43:05] sure i believe in crying but that's no
[1:43:07] evidence
[1:43:09] because both cry i've seen them shout
[1:43:11] just as hard as they could shout and
[1:43:13] just carry on like that that's a long
[1:43:14] way from you you know what i'm talking
[1:43:16] about i've heard them speak with tongues
[1:43:18] and go out and live any kind of life
[1:43:20] just do anything there was no sign
[1:43:23] you've heard me tell you've heard me
[1:43:25] tell of a woman who had was demon
[1:43:28] possessed because of
[1:43:30] that
[1:43:31] by the grace of god that we cast out but
[1:43:33] she was she was there a pentecostal girl
[1:43:36] that chased men and lived you know one i
[1:43:40] think she had four husbands and living
[1:43:42] with a fifth one and when i came to when
[1:43:45] i came to know her and she she was about
[1:43:47] to run out and marry that one and got
[1:43:48] convicted come back brother said brother
[1:43:50] tim i got to have some help
[1:43:52] i got a devil
[1:43:54] and i went to praying for her and she
[1:43:57] began to speak in other tongues
[1:44:00] i stood and watched that for a minute i
[1:44:02] just a young preacher myself still
[1:44:04] probably in my 20s and i said
[1:44:06] satan
[1:44:08] you've hid behind tongues all these
[1:44:09] times
[1:44:12] you you you brought this girl you get
[1:44:15] one man and and and then leave him and
[1:44:17] then get her another and then go back
[1:44:20] and speak in tongues and you is all
[1:44:21] right i've seen you before
[1:44:24] now you're exposed come out of her in
[1:44:26] the name of jesus christ
[1:44:28] she bowed to me about seven times to the
[1:44:31] name of jesus christ and claps on the
[1:44:33] floor never to live that kind of life
[1:44:35] again
[1:44:36] delivered
[1:44:39] that's the power of the gospel but satan
[1:44:42] will try to hide but behind what
[1:44:46] seemingly is manifestations of the
[1:44:48] spirit
[1:44:52] oh yeah
[1:44:54] i'd seen them in my time where boys
[1:44:56] would come to the altar
[1:44:58] and and i saw them as a
[1:45:00] at least heard my parents talk about
[1:45:02] them when they were young pentecostal
[1:45:03] boy the girl wouldn't marry him because
[1:45:05] he had never got the holy ghost see
[1:45:07] comes up and speaks in tongues and and
[1:45:08] gets the holy ghost and goes out and
[1:45:10] lives a drunken life
[1:45:14] gets what he wants
[1:45:17] you see
[1:45:18] again
[1:45:19] that was no sign
[1:45:21] and brother brandon said well then you
[1:45:23] say you're against it
[1:45:26] no i'm not
[1:45:27] i believe in speaking in tongues it's
[1:45:30] god's gift in the church if i took it
[1:45:32] out i'd take part of blood out
[1:45:35] if i had if i take my tongue out of my
[1:45:37] body here i wouldn't have a complete
[1:45:39] body the body of jesus christ has
[1:45:42] tongues in it
[1:45:44] the body of jesus christ here has
[1:45:46] tongues and and you take it out you take
[1:45:48] part of christ out and you still can't
[1:45:51] say that that's the body tongues is not
[1:45:53] the body
[1:45:55] but it's part of it
[1:45:57] but he said it's accepting the person
[1:45:59] christ jesus and then all these other
[1:46:02] things will come right with it
[1:46:04] and fit together
[1:46:07] now
[1:46:08] you see let let every member in this
[1:46:11] body this morning
[1:46:12] let this little group of people if we
[1:46:14] could pull the curtains down along on
[1:46:17] each side and every person in here
[1:46:19] receive
[1:46:21] a person the person of christ jesus
[1:46:23] there'd never be a flesh it wouldn't be
[1:46:25] an argument there'd be perfect love
[1:46:27] you'd still believe this or that and
[1:46:29] believe that but it'd be full of love
[1:46:32] see jesus said by your fruit you will
[1:46:34] know them and the fruit of the spirit is
[1:46:36] love joy peace long suffering goodness
[1:46:37] meekness gentleness now he said i'm
[1:46:40] going to give you my estimation of what
[1:46:42] i think
[1:46:43] the closest thing to an evidence that a
[1:46:46] man that is a christian
[1:46:49] that anything i know of you know what it
[1:46:51] is
[1:46:52] it's travail of soul
[1:46:54] a person that's always so hungering and
[1:46:58] thirsting for god
[1:47:00] they just simply day and night they
[1:47:02] can't stand it they just got to do
[1:47:05] something for god they're full of love
[1:47:06] they just told travail travailing all
[1:47:08] the time the bible said he that goes
[1:47:11] forth sowing in tears well doubtless
[1:47:13] return again rejoicing bringing with him
[1:47:15] precious sheeps
[1:47:17] is that right
[1:47:18] now he said if i said this morning of
[1:47:21] the to this little group of people he's
[1:47:23] talking to his church now look
[1:47:25] god would say look william branham i'm
[1:47:27] going to make you answer for that group
[1:47:29] of people
[1:47:30] what would you tell them
[1:47:33] now do you want them all to shout and he
[1:47:35] said sure i want them to shout
[1:47:40] now he's answering god god's asking the
[1:47:42] question do you want them to shout yes
[1:47:45] i want them to shout
[1:47:47] do you want them all to speak with
[1:47:48] tongues i want every one of them to
[1:47:52] paul said that too
[1:47:55] i wouldn't that you all spoke with
[1:47:56] tongues
[1:47:58] dude do you want them to all dance in
[1:48:00] the spirit i want all of them too
[1:48:05] all right well very good but what would
[1:48:07] you rather them do
[1:48:09] i'd rather have a church
[1:48:11] that had such a burden on their heart
[1:48:13] for prayer they stated this altar would
[1:48:16] be here day and night and everything in
[1:48:18] their house
[1:48:19] and was constantly in prayer and humble
[1:48:21] and trying to get people to god
[1:48:24] and making calls the hospital business
[1:48:26] sick and trying to get people to come to
[1:48:28] church and do right i'd rather have that
[1:48:31] than all of the other put together
[1:48:36] although the other is right it belongs
[1:48:38] in the church in other words he said i
[1:48:40] would rather see people with a passion
[1:48:43] for god
[1:48:45] than to speak in tongues prophesy dance
[1:48:47] in the spirit but to have that passion
[1:48:51] notice what he goes on to say
[1:48:54] and and then speaking of an evidence but
[1:48:56] if i had to have it
[1:48:58] i put that soul travail first
[1:49:01] because if you got that
[1:49:03] the other will take place
[1:49:07] if you got that if you just get so
[1:49:09] hungry for god shouting will take place
[1:49:13] if you get so hungry for god's speaking
[1:49:15] in tongues will take place
[1:49:17] if you get so hungry for god you know
[1:49:20] and just keep on hunger and keep
[1:49:22] yourself and you go to se but now
[1:49:24] remember if you see yourself getting
[1:49:26] indifferent
[1:49:29] then there's another spirit trying to
[1:49:31] work itself in there
[1:49:33] so you see this is what he didn't want

[1:51:44] evidence that he points to in 1964 after
[1:51:48] the seals so it didn't change

[1:51:52] twister who has the holy ghost raise

[1:52:11] that day and night you weep and cry for
[1:52:15] the abominations
[1:52:18] what about your own self and your own
[1:52:20] experience i'm not trying to condemn you
[1:52:22] i'm trying to point out something
[1:52:24] that our passion must continue
[1:52:29] you know how long has it been
[1:52:33] since you yourself drank from el shaddai
[1:52:37] and received that energizing force
[1:52:40] coming down to your mortal body
[1:52:42] quickening
[1:52:46] can't rest day and night so full of joy

[1:53:34] [Applause]
[1:53:41] don't think for a moment
[1:53:43] that it ain't that way in your life
[1:53:48] because why you hate sin
[1:53:50] you don't want to be that way
[1:53:52] you want to be cleansed
[1:53:54] purged a real son of god not even an
[1:53:57] evil thought or anything anything will
[1:53:59] so wound you why the holy spirit is
[1:54:02] there
[1:54:05] saying that sin that's wrong
[1:54:07] and the devil's trying to come along and
[1:54:09] say but that's you that's you it's not
[1:54:11] me
[1:54:13] amen i'm dead to that i'm no more that
[1:54:16] this is not me i'm a son of god i've
[1:54:18] been birthed by the spirit i'm not in
[1:54:20] the world i belong to christ
[1:54:26] that's those he marks
[1:54:30] when joshua entered the land of canaan
[1:54:33] he said don't let one of them live
[1:54:36] there's a cute little baby i'm still
[1:54:38] quoting from brother branham reading
[1:54:39] from him a malachite or amorite kill it
[1:54:43] remember he'll grow up to be
[1:54:45] an adult amalekite he'll pollute the
[1:54:48] camp
[1:54:49] and will when little things come in like
[1:54:52] that disagreeing with the word get rid
[1:54:54] of the things
[1:54:57] notice that
[1:54:59] you see if the ceiling angel
[1:55:02] now i'm gonna i'm gonna get a little
[1:55:04] tough here
[1:55:06] you might think this is a little stern
[1:55:09] but the sealant angel the holy ghost
[1:55:12] if it can't put his seal of approval on
[1:55:16] your movie
[1:55:19] kill it
[1:55:25] if you can't put his seal of approval on
[1:55:28] your video game
[1:55:30] kill it
[1:55:34] if he can't put his seal of approval
[1:55:36] listen he's marking those come on and if
[1:55:38] you can't put seal of approval on your
[1:55:41] dress
[1:55:42] kill it
[1:55:45] [Applause]
[1:55:50] on your hair
[1:55:51] boy or girl kill it
[1:55:56] friendship with certain people kill that
[1:55:58] friendship
[1:56:01] come on now
[1:56:02] if you love the world or the things the
[1:56:04] world the love of god isn't in you
[1:56:07] and so you see the passion is the drive
[1:56:10] is is drive out ever inhabited of the
[1:56:14] land
[1:56:15] that would hold me back from my promise
[1:56:18] so i'm going to be as holy as god is
[1:56:20] holy righteous as he is righteous
[1:56:23] spirit-filled as he is spirit-filled
[1:56:25] have the faith of god in my heart come
[1:56:27] on somebody help me preach
[1:56:35] he said well they're good people i don't
[1:56:36] care how good they are
[1:56:38] if they contrary that word get it out of
[1:56:40] you
[1:56:42] it's growing a little a malachi
[1:56:45] well i'll tell you what this
[1:56:46] denominational person either good he's
[1:56:48] going to go to heaven well maybe he will
[1:56:50] but are you counting yourself just going
[1:56:52] to heaven are you going to be part of
[1:56:53] the bride in the new jerusalem
[1:56:58] don't let anything of the world
[1:56:59] influence you
[1:57:02] friends school teaching whatever else
[1:57:06] let only the word of god have
[1:57:07] preeminence in your life amen remember
[1:57:10] anything that denies the word stay away
[1:57:13] from it have nothing to do with it at
[1:57:15] all
[1:57:17] oh yeah
[1:57:19] so he said he spoke about signing crying
[1:57:22] for the abominations
[1:57:24] he said i'd i'd show you ten thousand
[1:57:27] speaking in tongues
[1:57:28] to one that's really burdened for sin
[1:57:30] that can't pray an hour
[1:57:32] but did you know the bible said to mark
[1:57:34] only those who sighed and cried for the
[1:57:36] abominations done the city
[1:57:38] that was the holy spirit coming to mark
[1:57:40] the people
[1:57:41] said to destroy an angel go forth and
[1:57:43] destroy everything that doesn't have a
[1:57:45] mark upon it and the mark of god is the
[1:57:47] holy ghost is the seal of god
[1:57:49] where are them people that's interested
[1:57:51] i can show you people that jump up and
[1:57:52] down crying church i can show you people
[1:57:54] shout and run over the building i can
[1:57:57] show you people that are prophesying
[1:57:58] they come to pass i can show you those
[1:58:00] that speak in tongues and run up and
[1:58:01] down the building and say things that
[1:58:02] actually interpret and come to pass but
[1:58:04] where is that person that sides in
[1:58:06] christ where are the people
[1:58:08] that the word has preeminence
[1:58:11] that believes the full word
[1:58:13] where is that burdened soul
[1:58:15] now and i didn't want to say what
[1:58:18] brother branham was describing used to
[1:58:20] be the case
[1:58:22] people did jump and shout and run all
[1:58:24] over the building prophesied yet didn't
[1:58:26] live it at home or work
[1:58:28] it was so superficial that religion
[1:58:30] didn't go home with him
[1:58:33] it stayed in the church it wouldn't live
[1:58:35] through the week
[1:58:38] but
[1:58:39] i'd like to say
[1:58:41] in 2022
[1:58:43] not so anymore
[1:58:45] oh that might be so in a few
[1:58:48] charismatic or pentecostal churches
[1:58:51] but we have so advanced
[1:58:53] in laodicean darkness
[1:58:56] until churches are now so cold
[1:58:59] their spiritual thermometer is 50 below
[1:59:02] zero
[1:59:03] and there hadn't been a shout or
[1:59:05] speaking in tongues nor a true
[1:59:08] interpretation in so long the new
[1:59:10] generation has never seen it much less
[1:59:12] experienced it
[1:59:17] don't hang up on me
[1:59:19] where are those signs crying god send a
[1:59:21] revival i'm so hungry for a meeting god
[1:59:24] look at the sins of the city terrible
[1:59:26] god won't you please send a revival god
[1:59:28] sent some good preachers you know did
[1:59:30] you notice he it wasn't why sign and cry

[1:59:36] hypocrites off kill all them sodomites
[1:59:39] burn them all with fire take me into
[1:59:42] heaven
[1:59:44] that's not what he said you're signing
[1:59:47] and crying send them a revival
[1:59:49] turn their hearts
[1:59:51] deal with their soul
[1:59:53] change their attitudes
[1:59:55] quicken that seed if there's a seed in
[1:59:57] them quaking them
[1:59:59] amen a burden for those that are lost
[2:00:05] not smug and it's us foreign no more
[2:00:09] amen
[2:00:11] got me and my little family saved and
[2:00:13] that's all i care about
[2:00:17] you see
[2:00:18] if you got that passion you get so
[2:00:20] hungry for god
[2:00:22] shouting will take place
[2:00:24] i've never shouted brother you've never
[2:00:26] been hungry enough
[2:00:28] you get an appetite for well you say how
[2:00:30] did how how in the world but tim i ain't
[2:00:33] been hungry enough well i'll tell you
[2:00:34] why because you'll you're satisfied on
[2:00:36] things of this world
[2:00:40] but when you start having a passion for
[2:00:42] god
[2:00:43] and a hunger within your soul there will
[2:00:45] be a deep calling unto the deep
[2:00:48] amen and your religion will go to work
[2:00:51] with you
[2:00:52] hello amen it'll go to school with you
[2:00:56] it'll live at home the children will see
[2:00:58] it
[2:01:02] it'll check you up out of your lazy
[2:01:04] chair on wednesday night and bring you
[2:01:05] to church
[2:01:08] you can't get enough of it you just
[2:01:10] don't feel up on sunday and you can miss
[2:01:12] the next three
[2:01:16] hello somebody you're gonna hung up on
[2:01:18] me
[2:01:21] you see
[2:01:22] brother madam even gave us an example of
[2:01:25] living and he said he told him hunting
[2:01:27] squirrels the limit was six one of the
[2:01:29] brothers killed nine
[2:01:31] and he asked
[2:01:32] where is the holy ghost conviction
[2:01:35] that would tell them they were doing
[2:01:36] wrong
[2:01:40] in other words you're to live a model
[2:01:42] christian
[2:01:44] no wonder our kids don't want what we
[2:01:46] got
[2:01:48] your attitude toward christ has a great
[2:01:51] impact on them
[2:01:55] hello
[2:01:57] you know i i i i realize we got people
[2:02:00] with passion and we got people with
[2:02:02] drive i can look at them all over this
[2:02:04] building but i'm telling you laodicea is
[2:02:07] creeping up on us
[2:02:10] until the passion isn't there even the
[2:02:12] way it used to be as we see the delay
[2:02:15] that is coming that is here where men
[2:02:18] are saying the lord is delayed is coming
[2:02:22] and therefore we begin lights in our in
[2:02:25] our in our attitude we get an attitude
[2:02:28] well you know i've worked so hard i
[2:02:30] don't feel like going to church let's go
[2:02:31] camping
[2:02:34] you know
[2:02:35] it's
[2:02:36] and so this sunday is camping and next
[2:02:38] sunday it's fishing and the next sunday
[2:02:41] it's turkey hunting and the next sunday
[2:02:43] it's deer
[2:02:49] sorry you didn't bring no eggs today
[2:02:52] maybe you're sorry
[2:02:55] even some of our retired folks
[2:02:58] are semi-retired you watch them they're
[2:03:00] home all week sunday rolls around and
[2:03:02] they're gone
[2:03:05] no respect to the house of god no
[2:03:07] respect to honor and the resurrection
[2:03:09] no travail of soul to come praying
[2:03:12] expecting believing for miracles of
[2:03:14] healing for the sick or for the law no
[2:03:16] no coming together to help bring an
[2:03:18] atmosphere
[2:03:22] you see christian isn't what you say
[2:03:25] it's what you live and what you do is an
[2:03:27] example
[2:03:29] you see
[2:03:30] and
[2:03:32] look look let me just go over this again
[2:03:34] this is the evidence that brother
[2:03:36] branham said that we should be have
[2:03:38] first off is a passion
[2:03:42] a passion to drive
[2:03:44] for christ for his word
[2:03:47] to give it all preeminence
[2:03:51] now the evangelicals took for their
[2:03:53] evidence of confession jesus christ the
[2:03:55] son of god
[2:03:56] listen i sat with a baptist man
[2:04:00] he was a good old boy he was now you
[2:04:03] know getting ready to marry for his 34th
[2:04:05] time
[2:04:06] and she was a girl that had been married
[2:04:08] before and all of this is against the
[2:04:10] scripture even against his baptist
[2:04:11] teaching and so on like that but you
[2:04:14] know he was talking to me about it
[2:04:16] and and he he's puffing on one cigarette
[2:04:20] lights the other and does that three
[2:04:21] weeks before he's been arrested for
[2:04:23] drunk driving that's been a few days in
[2:04:26] the slammer
[2:04:27] and he sits there and he looks at me
[2:04:29] sincerely
[2:04:30] brother tim i am not here to talk about
[2:04:33] my salvation i am secure in christ i
[2:04:36] have believed on him he is my lord and
[2:04:38] savior and i am ready to go to heaven
[2:04:41] this minute
[2:04:42] if the rapture can take would take place
[2:04:45] i am ready to go you know why because he
[2:04:49] had believed a lie
[2:04:52] that just saying jesus is my savior was
[2:04:54] always needed and there was no change
[2:05:00] i wonder how many are believing that lie
[2:05:02] around the message
[2:05:04] we say brandon branham and we're saved
[2:05:11] the devil's confessed jesus too
[2:05:14] they acknowledged him as son of god
[2:05:17] what have we got to do with thee thou
[2:05:18] son of god they recognize him as son of
[2:05:21] god they believe god is one and tremble
[2:05:25] amen pentecostals full gospel rely on i
[2:05:28] spoke in tongues
[2:05:29] so that's how they know they're a child
[2:05:31] of god yet you can speak with tongues of
[2:05:33] men and angels and like charity the love
[2:05:36] of god which is
[2:05:37] is his basic nature
[2:05:41] people in the message
[2:05:43] community let's deal with us for a
[2:05:44] minute
[2:05:46] you know trouble ain't out there anymore
[2:05:47] it's right here
[2:05:50] take the thought as proof of their
[2:05:51] sonship we know all the mysteries
[2:05:56] my god i've got a revelation i i
[2:05:58] understand we understand all the
[2:06:00] mysteries and yet many of them lack that
[2:06:03] elementary
[2:06:05] basic nature of god
[2:06:07] and they still have the love of the
[2:06:09] world and the things of the world
[2:06:12] all the while
[2:06:13] claiming to be so grown up and mature
[2:06:16] sons
[2:06:17] that they don't even know how to pray
[2:06:18] the prayer of faith anymore
[2:06:22] you see
[2:06:23] brother branham couldn't be against
[2:06:25] shouting and dancing in the spirit
[2:06:27] without being against the bible
[2:06:30] he couldn't be against speaking in
[2:06:32] tongues and signs and wonders without
[2:06:33] going against the great commission
[2:06:36] the great commission says that you know
[2:06:38] i go into all the world preach the
[2:06:40] gospel in my name you will cast out
[2:06:42] devils that's healed the sick
[2:06:46] amen in my name you will cast out devils
[2:06:48] in my name you will speak with newton he
[2:06:50] couldn't be against that without being
[2:06:52] against the great commission
[2:06:54] you see they misunderstood him when he
[2:06:56] preached because satan was there to
[2:06:59] twist his words and their ears and
[2:07:02] distort his truth
[2:07:04] after preaching for future home i'll
[2:07:06] give you an example people are so carnal
[2:07:09] in fact just go to the seals and when he
[2:07:12] mentions 500 or 700 instead of 7 000
[2:07:16] everybody made something spiritual that
[2:07:18] did he got so many questions is it going
[2:07:20] to really just be 700 in the rapture
[2:07:25] and brother brown said no i made a
[2:07:26] misstatement the bible says
[2:07:29] seven thousand well i still believe it
[2:07:34] and after preaching future home people
[2:07:36] would actually be so carnal
[2:07:39] that they would have to ask brother
[2:07:40] branham a question brother branham
[2:07:42] because he uses the illustration you
[2:07:44] know he said that
[2:07:45] the the new jerusalem is like gonna be
[2:07:47] 1500 miles that'd be like from here to
[2:07:49] florida and over here there and up to
[2:07:52] maine and and now and and what did they
[2:07:54] do
[2:07:55] they turned around and asked brother
[2:07:57] branham
[2:07:58] do we all have to live within that 1500
[2:08:00] miles make the rapture
[2:08:06] they misunderstood
[2:08:08] when he pointed out the impersonation of
[2:08:11] the holy ghost
[2:08:12] by depending on speaking in tongues
[2:08:14] instead of a changed life until they
[2:08:17] totally done away with speaking in
[2:08:18] tongues
[2:08:22] the question answered brother branham
[2:08:24] explains all that yeah and just what i
[2:08:26] just was telling you i i got that from
[2:08:28] this
[2:08:29] from what he had said
[2:08:31] he said now
[2:08:32] then if people say well then brother
[2:08:34] branham you don't believe we ought to
[2:08:36] speak with tongues he said then you get
[2:08:37] it exactly backwards from what i just
[2:08:39] said
[2:08:40] i believe you should speak with tongues
[2:08:44] and some of your people and you get
[2:08:45] these i get these like back here 1500
[2:08:48] miles you see being at the tabernacle
[2:08:50] you see all that satan was there to
[2:08:52] twist those words
[2:08:55] and when he explained his position on
[2:08:57] tongues it's not the evidence of the
[2:08:59] holy ghost and that you could speak with
[2:09:01] tongues without having the indwelling
[2:09:03] spirit and all of this is true the same
[2:09:05] as you can shout it's not and not have
[2:09:07] it then people dismiss shouting
[2:09:10] speaking in tongues saying brother
[2:09:12] branham didn't believe in the gifts and
[2:09:14] we're beyond that
[2:09:16] and if you decide to have what the bible
[2:09:18] declares is our inheritance you're just
[2:09:20] a baby
[2:09:21] you're immature
[2:09:23] and saved because when we are mature we
[2:09:26] put away childish things like that of
[2:09:28] prophecy
[2:09:30] and tongues
[2:09:33] and gifts of the spirit
[2:09:36] i like to deal with that for a moment
[2:09:38] we're still teaching
[2:09:40] and it ain't two o'clock yet
[2:09:44] amen
[2:09:45] first corinthians 13 8
[2:09:48] charity never faileth now let's talk
[2:09:50] about charity this is love divine love
[2:09:53] which brother branham said is the holy
[2:09:54] ghost when he went beyond the curtain of
[2:09:56] time he said this is the holy ghost
[2:10:00] that is
[2:10:02] god is love
[2:10:04] when you receive the love of god it
[2:10:06] gives you a love for truth
[2:10:10] so you won't get a strong delusion then
[2:10:12] because you got a love for truth
[2:10:14] amen when you get the holy ghost on the
[2:10:16] inside of you you've got a love for the
[2:10:18] things of god you've got a hatred for
[2:10:20] the things of the world
[2:10:22] come on
[2:10:24] amen it's the basic nature of god jesus
[2:10:27] said if you love me
[2:10:29] you'll keep my commandments
[2:10:33] so charity that love the holy ghost will
[2:10:36] never fail but whether they're
[2:10:38] prophecies
[2:10:39] they shall fail whether to be tongues
[2:10:42] they shall cease whether there be
[2:10:44] knowledge it shall vanish away for we
[2:10:47] know in part we prophesy in part but
[2:10:49] when that which is perfect has come then
[2:10:51] that which is in part shall be done away
[2:10:54] and when i thought as a child i speak as
[2:10:56] a child i understood as a child i
[2:10:58] thought as a child but when i became a
[2:11:00] man i put away childish thing and that's
[2:11:02] what they say oh but we've become men
[2:11:04] you see brother tim you're using the
[2:11:06] whole wrong type of using drinking from
[2:11:09] el shaddai and we're babies
[2:11:11] oh no i'm not
[2:11:12] that's a different type
[2:11:16] because we will nurse on el shaddai
[2:11:19] until our bodies are changed
[2:11:22] and until we are transformed in a moment
[2:11:25] twinkling of an eye we're going to be
[2:11:27] nursing from the holy ghost daily
[2:11:32] hour by hour are you with me
[2:11:34] now let me just read it again a little
[2:11:36] plainer translation and first
[2:11:38] corinthians 13 8 charity never faileth
[2:11:40] but whether it be prophecies they shall
[2:11:42] fail whether it be tongues they shall
[2:11:44] cease whether it be knowledge itself
[2:11:46] vanish away
[2:11:49] so here we come right here just a moment
[2:11:52] even knowledge will vanish away
[2:11:55] when that which is perfect has come
[2:12:00] and then he sums it all up
[2:12:03] in verse 1
[2:12:04] of
[2:12:05] which is the next continue the same
[2:12:07] thought follow after charity
[2:12:10] seek love and desire spiritual gifts but
[2:12:12] rather that you may prophesy
[2:12:15] so after he said all that he said
[2:12:17] about love
[2:12:19] he comes and says but follow after love
[2:12:23] but desire spiritual gifts and but
[2:12:26] rather that you may prophesy
[2:12:31] oh we don't read that one we ex that one
[2:12:33] out
[2:12:35] so let's just go back and i'm gonna
[2:12:37] start at verse eight
[2:12:39] and let's try this
[2:12:42] and this is another translation
[2:12:44] but i think it's helpful love will never
[2:12:47] become obsolete
[2:12:51] you see in heaven god will still be
[2:12:53] there
[2:12:55] now as far as the prophetic gifts they
[2:12:58] will not last unknown languages will
[2:13:00] become silent and the gift of knowledge
[2:13:03] will no longer be needed
[2:13:07] gifts of knowledge and prophecy are
[2:13:08] partial at best at least for now think
[2:13:11] about the prophecy think about the
[2:13:13] prophecies of brother branham
[2:13:16] when when he spoke of
[2:13:18] of um
[2:13:19] let's just say the driverless car
[2:13:22] and this is a prophecy of it think about
[2:13:24] how incomplete that is did he tell you
[2:13:26] what year
[2:13:31] come on somebody
[2:13:33] it didn't tell you all the details
[2:13:36] it told you it would come
[2:13:38] didn't say when
[2:13:40] didn't say who would be the president
[2:13:44] you see prophecy it was in part it
[2:13:46] didn't give all the information
[2:13:50] now watch
[2:13:52] love will never
[2:13:54] give some knowledge verse 9 gives a
[2:13:56] knowledge prophecy are partial at best
[2:13:58] at least for now
[2:14:01] but when the perfection and fullness of
[2:14:03] god's kingdom arrives all parts will end
[2:14:08] when i was a child i spoke or thought
[2:14:11] and reasoned and childlike way as we all
[2:14:13] do but when i became a man i left my
[2:14:16] childish ways behind
[2:14:18] for now
[2:14:20] right now we can only see a dim and
[2:14:23] blurry pictures of things as when we
[2:14:26] stare into a polished metal because
[2:14:28] that's what they had for a mirror
[2:14:30] polished a piece of metal till they had
[2:14:32] a reflection but it was dim and it was
[2:14:34] blurry
[2:14:35] and he says i realize that everything i
[2:14:37] know is only part of the big picture
[2:14:41] but one day when jesus arrives we will
[2:14:44] clearly see clearly face to face
[2:14:48] in that day i will know just as i've
[2:14:51] been holy known by god but now
[2:14:55] faith hopes and love remain and these
[2:14:59] three virtues must characterize our
[2:15:01] lives and the greatest of these is love
[2:15:05] so when everything verse 1 try to strive
[2:15:08] to love passionately seek the gifts of
[2:15:10] the spirit especially the gift of
[2:15:12] prophecy
[2:15:14] what
[2:15:16] so why wouldn't we follow after love as
[2:15:18] paul admonishes to
[2:15:20] and desire spiritual gifts but rather to
[2:15:22] prophesy
[2:15:24] for telling and speaking as the voice of
[2:15:26] god somebody has to be doing what the
[2:15:28] bible said he said i'll pour out my
[2:15:30] spirit upon all flesh my sons and
[2:15:33] daughters shall prophesy the old will
[2:15:36] drink dreams the young will see vision
[2:15:38] and this spirit will be upon men and
[2:15:40] women
[2:15:42] among all the church
[2:15:44] amen so you see this whole deal of when
[2:15:48] we are perfect is not now
[2:15:51] right now we need prophecy we need the
[2:15:55] voice of god to speak out right now we
[2:15:58] need the workings of the holy spirit but
[2:16:00] when we are transformed and they're on
[2:16:03] the other side
[2:16:04] then we won't need that anymore because
[2:16:06] we will know fully as we are known
[2:16:12] don't get it out of picture
[2:16:15] paul was talking about the future when
[2:16:17] we are changed
[2:16:19] that's when that which is perfect will
[2:16:21] come
[2:16:23] oh you said well brother tim but brother
[2:16:25] branham said now we have the perfect
[2:16:27] interpretation of of the word of god by
[2:16:30] divine inspiration or vindication
[2:16:34] and so therefore jumping up and down and
[2:16:36] trying to speak with tongues like kids
[2:16:38] has done away with and it is
[2:16:41] we have the perfect word given to us
[2:16:44] by divine vindication
[2:16:48] and trying to speak with tongues is over
[2:16:51] with
[2:16:52] jumping up and down like a kid and
[2:16:54] trying
[2:16:56] to speak in tongues is finished with
[2:16:59] that's babylonian
[2:17:02] that's confusion
[2:17:04] are you with me
[2:17:05] so why wouldn't shouldn't we follow
[2:17:07] absolute love as paul had monisters to
[2:17:09] and desire spiritual gifts but rather
[2:17:11] that we were prophesying because it said
[2:17:13] somebody's got to finish the work
[2:17:15] and it takes more than the promise
[2:17:18] the word is the promise
[2:17:20] but there has to be a faith to anoint
[2:17:22] that promise so we can give voice to it
[2:17:27] while we're beyond the gifts of spirit
[2:17:28] you know when the gifts of spirit is
[2:17:30] faith
[2:17:33] do you know when the gifts of spirit is
[2:17:35] healing
[2:17:36] guess what the resurrection is going to
[2:17:38] be a healing guess what the body changes
[2:17:40] is going to be a massive total divine
[2:17:43] healing
[2:17:44] it is we're not going to be beyond that
[2:17:46] until we are in perfect bodies and then
[2:17:50] we will have perfect knowledge
[2:17:53] what did sharon rose tell brother
[2:17:54] branham things he didn't know
[2:17:56] we're not babies here
[2:18:02] it's like you preached it and he hadn't
[2:18:04] preached it yet
[2:18:08] this is heaven he went there as a mortal
[2:18:13] and as a mortal he didn't know all
[2:18:14] things
[2:18:16] and so he's visiting there as a mortal
[2:18:18] but
[2:18:19] sherrod rose knows a lot of things he
[2:18:22] don't know
[2:18:23] look at beyond the curtain of time
[2:18:25] do you eat here
[2:18:26] no
[2:18:27] we don't eat here well why didn't he
[2:18:29] know that he was immortal
[2:18:31] but they knew it
[2:18:35] one day jesus will come
[2:18:37] and you'll be judged by what you
[2:18:38] preached
[2:18:39] all of these things
[2:18:41] everything as he went there he he was
[2:18:43] getting knowledge
[2:18:45] you know as a mortal going there but
[2:18:46] when you step from mortal into
[2:18:48] immortality
[2:18:50] in theophany theophany is a word form
[2:18:55] and so therefore you will know all
[2:18:57] things
[2:19:01] amen
[2:19:03] now
[2:19:03] let me just tell you there has to be a
[2:19:05] faith to anoint the word we're not going
[2:19:08] to meet devils we are meeting devils and
[2:19:11] we are casting them out
[2:19:14] why because we are once fulfilling the
[2:19:17] great commission
[2:19:19] recently we had a prayer line here
[2:19:22] how many were healed in that prayer line
[2:19:23] raise your hand oh look at there we got
[2:19:26] hands lifted up here the people healed
[2:19:27] in that prayer line what was we doing
[2:19:29] casting out devils
[2:19:31] amen these demons are real they push our
[2:19:34] kids into porn to drinking to lying to
[2:19:37] cutting themselves and even suicide
[2:19:40] amen there's all kinds of demons
[2:19:45] there of all different kinds of feminine
[2:19:47] abusers of themselves mankind
[2:19:49] fornicators porn addicts drunkards all
[2:19:51] kinds
[2:19:53] and they have a right to stay as long as
[2:19:55] sins are unconfessed
[2:19:58] but when sins have been repented up the
[2:20:01] devil has no right to stay
[2:20:04] amen and you cannot find the cure until
[2:20:06] you find the cause
[2:20:08] and the cause is always on repentance
[2:20:11] the reason people don't get the baptism
[2:20:13] of the holy ghost it didn't fully repent
[2:20:15] that's always the cause
[2:20:19] you know desperate people are bringing
[2:20:20] their children
[2:20:21] all the way from across the seas
[2:20:24] because of situations in their lives
[2:20:28] and that's a different it's just like in
[2:20:29] the days of bible i brought your i
[2:20:31] brought my lunatic child to to your
[2:20:33] disciples they couldn't cure him and
[2:20:35] that's a condition of too many message
[2:20:37] churches today they cannot cure them
[2:20:41] so they try psychology instead try easy
[2:20:44] believism and they continue right on the
[2:20:47] sin
[2:20:49] they claim the mystery of the baptism of
[2:20:50] the holy ghost without sensation but
[2:20:52] that's not all of it but the person of
[2:20:55] christ performing in you the same works
[2:20:57] that he did
[2:20:59] come on amen so just perform the works
[2:21:02] that jesus did he spoke in tongues he
[2:21:04] prophesied he cast out devils he healed
[2:21:07] the sick he worked miracles he opened
[2:21:09] the ears of the dead and the eyes of the
[2:21:11] blind just do what jesus did
[2:21:14] amen that's the baptism of the holy
[2:21:16] ghost the person of christ listen
[2:21:19] performing in you the works that he did
[2:21:28] are you still with me
[2:21:33] now these are worse than pentecostals
[2:21:35] they're weaker than baptists
[2:21:38] they're more faithless than a reprobate
[2:21:40] candlelight preacher
[2:21:43] who say the days of miracles are passed
[2:21:46] the same type that opposed brother
[2:21:48] branham and f.f bosworth and pointed
[2:21:51] their fingers in his face and god
[2:21:53] refused their picture to be taken
[2:21:55] instead vindicated a prophet
[2:22:01] so well today brother tim we got the
[2:22:03] interpretation of the divine word of god
[2:22:05] well
[2:22:06] okay when we need a devil cast out where
[2:22:09] is your perfect word now you claim to
[2:22:11] have
[2:22:13] well brother branham said
[2:22:15] that we have it with divine and
[2:22:18] divine vindication you claim to have
[2:22:20] perfect interpretation of word and words
[2:22:23] divine vindication
[2:22:25] you see we you see again divine
[2:22:28] vindication not sensation divine
[2:22:31] vindication not something you worked up
[2:22:34] divine vindication
[2:22:37] are you with me
[2:22:38] amen what
[2:22:39] what what you have is still a powerless
[2:22:42] religion whose only weapon is argument
[2:22:47] now so again first corinthians
[2:22:50] first corinthians says that which is
[2:22:52] important when that which is perfect has
[2:22:54] come that which is part shall be done
[2:22:56] away with
[2:22:57] so all these little things like jumping
[2:23:00] up and down like a kid trying to talk in
[2:23:02] tongues and all these other things
[2:23:03] when that which is perfect but now in
[2:23:06] the same sermon
[2:23:08] brother brandon says this now
[2:23:10] in the same sermon
[2:23:13] he says i would like i would that every
[2:23:17] member of my church spoke with tongues
[2:23:21] i would like for them to do that and i
[2:23:24] believe if you would ask god god will
[2:23:26] grant it to you
[2:23:27] so the same what the same sermon that he
[2:23:31] says jumping up and down like a kid
[2:23:33] trying to speak with tongues is over
[2:23:35] because now we have the perfect
[2:23:37] interpretation of the word
[2:23:39] in the same ceremony he turns around and
[2:23:41] says what did everybody here spoke in
[2:23:43] tongues
[2:23:46] hmm
[2:23:51] well brother tim
[2:23:53] here's the deal
[2:23:55] we would rather have perfect love than
[2:23:57] any divine gift
[2:24:02] well
[2:24:03] okay
[2:24:07] i'm having trouble finding perfect love
[2:24:09] or any get divine gift
[2:24:13] where's your display of divine love
[2:24:15] that makes a bull go lay down and
[2:24:17] harness back to their nest
[2:24:19] that makes demons fall at your feet
[2:24:24] we have perfect love and now all the
[2:24:26] gifts are on the shelf
[2:24:27] how many times the devil get to use that
[2:24:33] you know how the devil loves to twist
[2:24:36] the prophet's words that was never what
[2:24:38] the prophet said
[2:24:40] he never taught that that now tongues
[2:24:43] interpretation prophecy discerning the
[2:24:45] spirits working the miracles the gift of
[2:24:47] healing gift of wisdom word of knowledge
[2:24:50] faith
[2:24:53] and all of these are now laid on the
[2:24:54] shelf
[2:24:57] that's what's been taught around the
[2:24:59] world
[2:25:02] so here's what he said
[2:25:04] and then jesus came 1957 quote
[2:25:08] in his church jeffersonville and after
[2:25:11] this morning
[2:25:13] the holy spirit
[2:25:15] so beautifully came down and bathed in
[2:25:17] us in his great beauty
[2:25:19] i was just inspired to speak them words
[2:25:22] and say some glorious day
[2:25:25] that all the gifts that is in the church
[2:25:28] will just be set aside on the mantle as
[2:25:32] it was
[2:25:34] and the holy spirit himself will take
[2:25:37] the church in such control of divine
[2:25:40] love
[2:25:41] until the sick will be healed the blind
[2:25:44] will see the lame will walk without
[2:25:48] hands being laid on them
[2:25:50] it will be one great big unity
[2:25:55] oh
[2:25:57] so when this great divine love comes
[2:26:01] and sweeps over the building blind eyes
[2:26:03] will come open
[2:26:06] death will hear lame will walk
[2:26:09] without even hands being laid on them
[2:26:16] now when in the world is it going to be
[2:26:18] that we get this great outpouring of
[2:26:21] divine love that puts gifts on the shelf
[2:26:24] whether when is that going to happen so
[2:26:25] it's already happened well it happened
[2:26:28] that ain't true
[2:26:32] when is this going to happen
[2:26:34] you see in the message before where that
[2:26:37] he's referring to
[2:26:39] he was speaking about and you can go
[2:26:41] listen to the sermon before this one
[2:26:43] that right now signs and wonders are
[2:26:45] done through laying on a hand because
[2:26:47] preaching because of preaching
[2:26:49] but one day when the when the day of
[2:26:51] preaching is over and the last one has
[2:26:53] come in and it's over
[2:26:56] then these wonderful gifts will be laid
[2:26:58] on the mantle and the love of god which
[2:27:00] is the holy ghost will come with a
[2:27:02] higher standard than all the gifts and
[2:27:04] love and will
[2:27:06] love will just settle over the people
[2:27:08] and in that great outpouring of in that
[2:27:11] great outpouring of love every sickness
[2:27:14] will flee every blind eye will be opened
[2:27:21] well this ain't happened yet but it's
[2:27:23] going to happen
[2:27:26] let me tell you
[2:27:27] here's what the prophet said about that
[2:27:29] great outpouring
[2:27:31] because divine love is the holy ghost do
[2:27:33] we agree with that
[2:27:34] the hour that we're living in oh god the
[2:27:37] world is falling apart they're hangs in
[2:27:38] the hangars bombs their hangs the things

[2:28:18] anybody waving a wand or a hand
[2:28:21] going out to the graveyard raising the
[2:28:23] dead
[2:28:24] there won't be a preacher laying hands
[2:28:26] on you and say gray hair come back the
[2:28:27] right color
[2:28:30] amen come on divine love the holy ghost
[2:28:33] will so come down in an outpouring
[2:28:37] that the dead in christ has been dead
[2:28:40] for 2 000 years will rise
[2:28:43] completely totally restored
[2:28:49] this is what he said the dynamics of
[2:28:51] this church would be a refilling of the
[2:28:53] holy ghost we have worked it in a small
[2:28:56] measure but when it comes in its
[2:28:58] fullness
[2:29:00] missing limbs will be restored
[2:29:03] amen your old eyeball you think i bought
[2:29:06] a pop out of your head and your new one
[2:29:08] will come in a god-given one

[2:29:15] coming back in
[2:29:17] great hair will come back the right
[2:29:19] color
[2:29:20] amen your own artificial knee you won't
[2:29:22] need it anymore and you'll be dancing
[2:29:25] around in a new body
[2:29:28] hallelujah what will it be an outpouring
[2:29:31] of divine love the holy ghost and every
[2:29:34] gift will be laid on the mantle as it
[2:29:37] was
[2:29:37] [Applause]
[2:29:43] that's when every gift will be laid on
[2:29:45] the mantle
[2:29:47] you see that's the thing the devil tries
[2:29:50] to do to twist it he tries to make you
[2:29:52] make things that are for the future and
[2:29:55] try to make them now
[2:29:58] that's why the era demons worked in the
[2:30:01] early church saying the days that that
[2:30:03] the resurrection was already passed
[2:30:08] they were taking the words of paul that
[2:30:10] paul used and positionally said listen
[2:30:13] you're resurrected in christ you're
[2:30:14] raised from the dead and they took that
[2:30:16] and preached it and spiritualized it
[2:30:18] until nobody now believed in the
[2:30:20] resurrection they were preaching the
[2:30:23] physical resurrection was over
[2:30:29] these same demons say the millennium's
[2:30:31] already here
[2:30:33] the gifts are already on the mantle
[2:30:35] that's a devil
[2:30:42] and that perfect love the full power of
[2:30:44] the holy ghost comes on the church
[2:30:46] every sickness will go

[2:31:20] and we
[2:31:21] with one accord
[2:31:23] will all speak
[2:31:25] in tongues
[2:31:28] oh
[2:31:30] you didn't say that brother tim yes i
[2:31:32] did
[2:31:33] you don't know that you think you're
[2:31:35] going to be speaking english
[2:31:37] or french no rapture day we won't be
[2:31:40] talking an earthly language anymore
[2:31:42] we'll all be speaking a heavenly
[2:31:44] language
[2:31:49] hallelujah did you know brother branham
[2:31:51] said in the millennium ahead we would
[2:31:53] all speak in tongues of a heavenly
[2:31:56] language it won't be a flag of america
[2:31:59] over here and a flag of prince over
[2:32:01] there and a flag of this but there'll be
[2:32:04] one flag hallelujah that's the flag of
[2:32:07] the cross
[2:32:08] and there we will all speak not of
[2:32:11] babylonian language but we'll speak in a
[2:32:14] heavenly language
[2:32:17] [Applause]
[2:32:20] and i quote but there's one kingdom that
[2:32:22] we believe that's coming the lord jesus
[2:32:24] christ has set up a everlasting kingdom
[2:32:27] and all the nations of the world that
[2:32:29] say will live in that kingdom there be
[2:32:32] one flag one nation one people speaking
[2:32:34] one language and that's the heavenly
[2:32:36] language
[2:32:42] hallelujah
[2:32:44] when you talk about supernatural friends
[2:32:46] this church is a supernatural church
[2:32:49] amen
[2:32:51] brother branham even said
[2:32:53] now this is what he said and faith is
[2:32:54] our victory to his own church
[2:32:57] he says
[2:32:58] if you went to foreign country
[2:33:01] he said
[2:33:03] you wouldn't try to learn their slang
[2:33:06] he said you think you'd be trying to do
[2:33:07] is learn a few words
[2:33:09] of that language there maybe it's much
[2:33:11] to say how do you do
[2:33:15] probably for most of us is
[2:33:18] where can i eat
[2:33:23] but nevertheless he said
[2:33:26] you'd be trying to learn a few words of
[2:33:29] that language
[2:33:31] of that country
[2:33:34] and much to say how do you do
[2:33:37] and i think it would behoove christians
[2:33:39] today
[2:33:41] more today
[2:33:42] if they were trying to learn some
[2:33:44] heavenly language
[2:33:46] the praises of god
[2:33:48] that we're going to sing over there and
[2:33:51] enjoy and the people that does not
[2:33:53] believe in shouting what would you do
[2:33:56] when you get over there you would be out
[2:33:58] so out of place
[2:34:00] better get faith and overcome now for
[2:34:03] faith is the victory that overcomes
[2:34:08] and then he went on to explain
[2:34:10] how to learn that heavenly language
[2:34:12] you would do it by surrendering yourself
[2:34:14] so much to him
[2:34:16] yielding and submitting until it flows
[2:34:19] out of you until you're quickened
[2:34:24] oh that was before the seals brother tim
[2:34:26] okay easter seal
[2:34:29] 1965
[2:34:34] and this and you're quickened
[2:34:36] and this quickening power brings your
[2:34:38] body
[2:34:39] into a raptured condition already
[2:34:42] what quickening power brings your body
[2:34:45] into a raptured condition already
[2:34:48] notice the pentecostal people up there
[2:34:51] when they got quickened by the holy
[2:34:53] spirit listen to me that penteco those
[2:34:55] pentecostal group up there on the day of
[2:34:57] pentecost receive their abstract deed
[2:35:00] from god sure it glorified their soul
[2:35:03] they screamed they saw tongues of fire
[2:35:05] separated on each other and it's so
[2:35:07] quick in their body listen quick in
[2:35:10] their body in a pre-rupture condition
[2:35:14] what's what he said till they couldn't
[2:35:16] speak in an earthly language anymore it
[2:35:20] quickened their body to heavenly
[2:35:21] language the place they are going
[2:35:24] to amen quickening powers shook their
[2:35:27] mortal bodies until their entire mortal
[2:35:30] language was transfigured transformed
[2:35:33] into an immortal language what a
[2:35:35] quickening power
[2:35:37] if the spirit that raised up jesus from
[2:35:39] the dead dwells in your mortal body it
[2:35:41] shall also quicken your mortal body we
[2:35:44] are quickened by the power of the living
[2:35:46] god
[2:35:47] tongues
[2:35:49] quicken to a heavenly new heavenly
[2:35:52] language to speak them a rapture enough
[2:35:55] raising up into a different atmosphere
[2:35:57] than what they had ever lived and also
[2:36:00] that new quickening life to them then it
[2:36:02] come to them it quickened their language
[2:36:04] they spoke in new tongues oh yes now
[2:36:07] watch them it was designed to give them
[2:36:09] after this abstract design to give them
[2:36:12] every promise
[2:36:15] that was on the ground
[2:36:17] i say watchtopic tongues
[2:36:19] why don't we take everything pentecost
[2:36:22] wanted to stop at tongues and make a
[2:36:24] denomination but why don't we take
[2:36:26] everything come on
[2:36:28] every promise on the ground every
[2:36:30] promise on the grounds of god's word
[2:36:32] that was promised in the bible that
[2:36:33] quickening power was given to them to
[2:36:35] quicken that promise to therefore they
[2:36:37] laid hands on the sick they were healed
[2:36:39] they spoke in new tongues they'd done
[2:36:41] great signs and wonders because that was
[2:36:44] in god's promise and when jesus died to
[2:36:46] redeem that back to them the grounds
[2:36:48] that belonged to sons of god he
[2:36:51] demonstrated what god was how dare we to
[2:36:54] socialize that and put in an
[2:36:56] organization we have no right to it how
[2:36:59] dare we just say that's just for a zeus
[2:37:01] of pentecost
[2:37:03] it wasn't for them it's for us
[2:37:06] it's the holy spirit today honey in our
[2:37:08] honest hearts that believe that message
[2:37:11] everything in the bible that was
[2:37:12] promised is that believer and when you
[2:37:15] accept it in his fullness
[2:37:17] somebody with me when you accept it in
[2:37:20] his fullness and god knows that you do
[2:37:23] he gives you the abstract to that
[2:37:26] and then every promise that's made is in
[2:37:28] your possession and the holy spirit is
[2:37:30] there to quicken that to you what kind
[2:37:33] of people should we be how wonderful to
[2:37:35] see the great holy spirit here to do
[2:37:37] that power think of it though when the
[2:37:39] holy spirit its holy ghost itself is
[2:37:42] here to bear record of this hour jesus
[2:37:45] christ said so he's the same yesterday
[2:37:48] today and forever how dare any man to
[2:37:50] wipe that out of there the works that i
[2:37:52] do so you do also john 14 12. these
[2:37:55] signs have followed them that believe
[2:37:56] that is assurance and when we see a
[2:37:59] group of people
[2:38:00] sitting together and those signs
[2:38:02] manifest himself that is the assurance
[2:38:05] that the abstract is there to vindicate
[2:38:08] that that's property of god
[2:38:10] hallelujah
[2:38:12] amen you say well brother tim but
[2:38:14] that was to a full gospel businessman
[2:38:16] meeting he's talking to pentecostal uh
[2:38:19] so it was a pentecostal group and he was
[2:38:21] just kind of uh kissing up to them oh
[2:38:23] well let's tell you then what about the
[2:38:25] last easter message to his own church
[2:38:29] it is the rising of the sun
[2:38:31] notice at pentecost their bodies were
[2:38:34] quickened to a new life
[2:38:36] look at that little bunch of cowards oh
[2:38:38] but they had the mechanics but they were
[2:38:40] sitting back there saying oh i'm afraid
[2:38:42] of them i'm afraid to go out and make a
[2:38:43] claim because all of them are big
[2:38:45] bishops and things out there i'm i'm so
[2:38:47] afraid and priests and and the them
[2:38:50] preaching things i'm afraid to make that
[2:38:51] claim afraid to say i believed on him i
[2:38:54] can't do it but all of a sudden the
[2:38:56] dynamics come
[2:38:57] and what it do it not only filled their
[2:39:00] spirit inside but it quickened their
[2:39:02] mechanics their bodies were kicking
[2:39:04] there were no more cowards they went
[2:39:06] right out in the face of those people
[2:39:08] and said yes sir you man of judea you
[2:39:11] that dwell in jerusalem when before the
[2:39:14] dynamics came they were just mechanics
[2:39:16] you men see you men that dwell in
[2:39:19] jerusalem let's be known to you hearken
[2:39:21] to my words these are not drunkards you
[2:39:23] suppose i'm one of them this is that and
[2:39:26] i'll show you what it is it's the
[2:39:28] scripture this is that and i've always
[2:39:30] said if this ain't that let me keep this
[2:39:32] so that comes
[2:39:35] i'm gonna say with the prophet right
[2:39:37] there if this ain't that
[2:39:39] let me stay with this till that comes
[2:39:43] amen no this is that spirit that was
[2:39:46] spoken of this is that which was spoken
[2:39:48] about the prophet joel it shall come to
[2:39:50] pass in the last days said god i'll pour
[2:39:53] out my spirit upon all flesh see the
[2:39:56] dynamics coming to the mechanics they
[2:39:58] wasn't afraid no more
[2:40:00] some of you women are afraid
[2:40:02] some woman will laugh at you for having
[2:40:04] long hair quit wearing makeup some of
[2:40:06] you men are afraid your organization
[2:40:08] will throw you out when you're baptized
[2:40:09] in the name of jesus christ and
[2:40:12] spiritual baptism where you you need to
[2:40:15] close yourself in the upper room till
[2:40:16] the dynamics come it change them and
[2:40:18] quickened them it made them different
[2:40:20] they would change people from then on it
[2:40:22] quickened them from an old life of being
[2:40:24] a coward to to martyrdom
[2:40:27] uh to be like the the lion of the tribe
[2:40:29] of judah they faced martyrdom nailed to
[2:40:31] the cross crucified upside down burnt
[2:40:34] thrown in the lion's den no more cowards
[2:40:36] about them death had no victory over
[2:40:39] them at all dynamics was in the
[2:40:41] mechanics it quickened their mortal
[2:40:43] bodies
[2:40:44] now here's
[2:40:45] another thing
[2:40:47] for proof
[2:40:50] i'm quoting
[2:40:52] now here listen now listen here's
[2:40:55] another thing for proof
[2:40:59] it's so quick in them in such a way
[2:41:02] to you know what they were lifted up to
[2:41:05] heavenly places and their mortal bodies
[2:41:08] was so quickened until their language
[2:41:12] changed it quickened their language
[2:41:15] that's what the bible said and their
[2:41:17] mortal bodies being quickened their
[2:41:20] language was quickened their thoughts
[2:41:23] were quickened their spirits were
[2:41:25] quickened their life was quickened they
[2:41:28] were quickened all together they tried
[2:41:31] to talk and couldn't talk anymore in
[2:41:33] human languages they were so quickened
[2:41:35] up in the presence of god till they
[2:41:37] spoke in new tongues a heavenly language
[2:41:40] what a quickening power if the spirit
[2:41:43] that raised up jesus from the dead
[2:41:46] dwells in you all hallelujah it'll
[2:41:48] quicken your mortal body it'll make you
[2:41:50] do things you wouldn't do before that
[2:41:53] was full so full of quickening power
[2:41:55] then your body ain't subject to sin
[2:41:59] anymore your desires
[2:42:02] what did they do
[2:42:04] they spoke in another language
[2:42:07] the bible said they spoke in every
[2:42:09] tongue under heaven could you imagine
[2:42:11] demo mortal bodies that's in there well
[2:42:14] i don't know whether i can believe this
[2:42:15] or not and all once it was so quick
[2:42:18] till the bravery of the lion of the
[2:42:20] tribe of judah fell into them over that
[2:42:22] waving sheep sheath and that eagle come
[2:42:25] to call its own and they love not their
[2:42:27] lives and death and there's going to be
[2:42:29] more who give their lives blood for this
[2:42:31] holy
[2:42:32] gospel than this crimson flood and the
[2:42:34] sun has got to be revealed again in the
[2:42:36] bride in the last day the quickening
[2:42:39] power has to come quicken them
[2:42:41] them out of this dead denomination
[2:42:44] creeds to the living word of god it
[2:42:46] quaking them to new life it does the
[2:42:48] same thing for us now notice they were
[2:42:50] so quick and in that quickening power
[2:42:53] and brother brandon says listen close
[2:42:56] now i'm trying to show you the
[2:42:59] quickening power wasn't only in their
[2:43:02] soul but it was all over them
[2:43:06] not only the dynamics come in the
[2:43:08] quicken but it quickened the mechanics
[2:43:10] you see what i mean they were so quick
[2:43:13] until their tongue began to speak in
[2:43:15] another language they were so quickened
[2:43:17] by the power of the resurrection of
[2:43:19] christ
[2:43:20] with quickening power till they laid
[2:43:22] their hands on the sick and they got
[2:43:24] well it quickened their mortal body they
[2:43:27] were healed by laying on their hands
[2:43:31] and the holy spirit quickened their
[2:43:33] fellowship together with god until there
[2:43:36] was so quicken in the presence of god
[2:43:38] that when a person died and that soul
[2:43:40] had gone off it called him back to life
[2:43:42] again
[2:43:44] amen glory said i'm feeling religious
[2:43:46] that's right quicken not only was his
[2:43:50] resurrection power for him self but
[2:43:52] whosoever will to this predestinated
[2:43:55] seed that's laying there quicken
[2:43:57] quickens the mortal body lay hands on
[2:43:59] the sick they recover that prayed in the
[2:44:01] spirit they saw vision they called the
[2:44:03] dead back to life that's right quick in
[2:44:05] their mortal bodies
[2:44:08] that's what the holy ghost did then
[2:44:09] that's what the holy ghost would do now
[2:44:12] that's what the prophet was preaching we
[2:44:14] have to see quickening power the holy
[2:44:16] ghost self shady i is here to energize
[2:44:20] the pride to fill him with his life and
[2:44:23] his power
[2:44:27] hallelujah
[2:44:29] now
[2:44:32] how long are we going to nurse on el
[2:44:34] shaddai
[2:44:36] until our bodies are changed
[2:44:40] it's not a one-time nursing
[2:44:43] it's a power for every day
[2:44:46] it's an
[2:44:47] inexhaustible resource
[2:44:53] brother branham said when you're filled
[2:44:55] with the spirit here's one of the best
[2:44:57] signs i know
[2:44:58] you're so in love with christ
[2:45:00] and believe every word he says to be the
[2:45:02] truth
[2:45:03] that's the evidence you have the holy
[2:45:05] ghost and your life is so full of joy
[2:45:08] and everything oh my it's different from
[2:45:10] what it used to be that's the holy
[2:45:12] spirit
[2:45:15] now
[2:45:17] let me bring it down too close
[2:45:20] this can be really intense
[2:45:26] when you're born of the spirit
[2:45:30] you can get in the spirit any day
[2:45:33] any hour
[2:45:37] el shaddai
[2:45:39] is for everybody
[2:45:41] all times
[2:45:42] any moment
[2:45:43] any place
[2:45:45] driving down the road
[2:45:47] in your prayer closet home
[2:45:49] in the church
[2:45:50] it's not just reserved for church
[2:45:53] a drink from el shaddai can happen all
[2:45:55] the time
[2:45:56] he said if we would pray
[2:45:59] until our soul comes into the presence
[2:46:01] of god and then just relax
[2:46:04] and listen to his voice
[2:46:10] now let me just take a few minutes
[2:46:13] did you know
[2:46:14] that tongues were the result of the
[2:46:16] spirit himself speaking through the
[2:46:18] people
[2:46:21] and they were all filled with the spirit
[2:46:23] the bible said
[2:46:24] and began to talk in other tongues
[2:46:26] as the spirit gave them utterance
[2:46:29] so tongues
[2:46:30] was
[2:46:31] the result
[2:46:33] of the spirit speaking
[2:46:35] through the people
[2:46:38] think of that
[2:46:40] as i said it's not a one and done affair
[2:46:46] you see we got to follow christ every
[2:46:49] day or we have taken an organizational
[2:46:51] life
[2:46:54] so think of it we can nurse on him and
[2:46:56] receive a refreshing from his spirit
[2:46:59] any time
[2:47:07] how many would like to be refreshed in
[2:47:08] the spirit
[2:47:11] it's for you
[2:47:14] now i'm just going to say
[2:47:18] part of that is praying until you get in
[2:47:21] the spirit until you actually break out
[2:47:23] into
[2:47:24] a heavenly language
[2:47:27] you say i don't know that brother tim
[2:47:29] that's not bible
[2:47:31] well let me just tell you what the bible
[2:47:33] had to say about it
[2:47:35] in private prayer
[2:47:37] the bible teaches paul taught us that
[2:47:40] tongues aided the believer
[2:47:43] or the speaker
[2:47:45] to praise god
[2:47:46] tongues aided the believer or the
[2:47:50] speaker to praise god
[2:47:52] they let
[2:47:53] the speaker pray even at those times
[2:47:57] when they wasn't sure to ask for
[2:48:01] tongues are for that reason when you
[2:48:03] don't even know what to ask for
[2:48:05] you pray until you break out into that
[2:48:07] heavenly language
[2:48:10] and in public worship
[2:48:12] when accompanied by
[2:48:13] another the nine gifts interpretation
[2:48:16] tongues provided a vehicle of direct
[2:48:19] communication between god and his people
[2:48:24] in the case of tongues
[2:48:26] let's just put up first corinthians 14
[2:48:28] and 4
[2:48:30] the purpose of them
[2:48:32] is the strengthening of the one who uses
[2:48:35] them
[2:48:36] he
[2:48:37] that speaketh in tongues edifieth builds
[2:48:41] up or strengthens himself
[2:48:45] so here is a reason
[2:48:48] for speaking in tongues
[2:48:49] it strengthens the one who's speaking in
[2:48:52] tongues
[2:48:56] also
[2:48:57] paul
[2:48:58] refers to this as a form of prayer
[2:49:03] now
[2:49:04] you can see why the devil don't want
[2:49:05] this happening
[2:49:07] he don't want to church strong
[2:49:10] he don't want you to he he don't want
[2:49:12] you to to to have that as a form of
[2:49:14] prayer verse 14 chapter 14 14 if i pray
[2:49:18] in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth
[2:49:23] so tongues is a form of prayer
[2:49:28] it's when your spirit prayeth
[2:49:31] now you can pray with your intelligence
[2:49:33] and with your mouth but when your spirit
[2:49:34] prays it's in another language a
[2:49:37] heavenly language
[2:49:40] all right so what is it then verse 15 i
[2:49:43] will pray with the spirit i will pray
[2:49:45] with understanding also i won't do all
[2:49:47] my praying in tongues i will also pray
[2:49:49] in
[2:49:50] with understanding
[2:49:51] i will sing in the spirit and i will i
[2:49:54] will sing with the understanding also
[2:49:56] else then when i bless with the spirit
[2:49:59] how then shall he that occupied the room
[2:50:01] of the unlearned say amen at that giving
[2:50:03] of thanks we have seen that he
[2:50:05] understands not what they're saying so
[2:50:07] why should we pray in tongues it allows
[2:50:10] me to worship god
[2:50:12] and bless god in the spirit thou shalt
[2:50:15] bless with the spirit
[2:50:18] i just read that
[2:50:20] so it allows you to worship god and
[2:50:23] bless god in the spirit
[2:50:26] what else
[2:50:27] it allows me to pray in the spirit for
[2:50:31] he says i will pray in the spirit and
[2:50:34] with understanding also so it allows me
[2:50:37] to pray in the spirit
[2:50:39] i can even worship in the spirit i will
[2:50:44] sing in the spirit and i will sing with
[2:50:46] understanding also
[2:50:49] so it allows me to worship in the spirit
[2:50:53] it builds and encourages and strengthens
[2:50:56] the speaker because he that speaketh in
[2:50:59] and
[2:50:59] and an unknown tongue edifies himself it
[2:51:03] builds you up it edifies you it
[2:51:05] refreshes you
[2:51:08] now paul also taught us
[2:51:12] in romans 8 26
[2:51:16] he taught us he see that he saw tongues
[2:51:18] as a way to pray
[2:51:20] when your mind is perplexed
[2:51:23] when you don't know what to ask for
[2:51:26] how do i pray about this
[2:51:30] what's this
[2:51:32] likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[2:51:35] infirmities for when we know not what we
[2:51:38] should pray for as we ought but the
[2:51:41] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[2:51:44] with groanings that cannot be uttered
[2:51:48] so you see and then he goes on
[2:51:50] the next verse where he says
[2:51:52] what's and he's he that searches the
[2:51:54] heart knoweth what is the mind of the
[2:51:56] spirit because he maketh the
[2:51:58] intercession for the saints according to
[2:52:00] the will of god so when i pray and i
[2:52:02] don't know what the will of god is i can
[2:52:04] get in the spirit and i can pray
[2:52:09] in other tongues
[2:52:11] and the spirit is making intercession
[2:52:17] so
[2:52:18] in the same way the spirit
[2:52:21] comes to the aid of our weakness we
[2:52:23] don't know how we ought to pray
[2:52:25] but through our groans are lust for
[2:52:27] words the spirit himself is pleading for
[2:52:30] us and god who searches our innermost
[2:52:32] being knows what the spirit means
[2:52:35] because he pleads for his god's own
[2:52:37] people in god's own way it's a way for
[2:52:40] god to make intercession for it through
[2:52:43] you
[2:52:46] now church this isn't just new testament
[2:52:48] this is message
[2:52:52] listen there are two different kinds of
[2:52:54] tongues there are tons of angels that is
[2:52:57] men and private prayer out yonder
[2:52:59] somewhere speaking of god speaking to
[2:53:01] god in angelic tongues
[2:53:04] inside the illinois
[2:53:06] brother branham tells of having a
[2:53:08] meeting
[2:53:09] he felt so pressed in the spirit he just
[2:53:12] couldn't get ready to go for the meeting
[2:53:14] it was so heavy and was praying and
[2:53:16] praying and just so heavy
[2:53:18] and billy paul come knocked on his door
[2:53:20] says time to go to church he said i
[2:53:22] can't go billy
[2:53:25] and he just kept praying and praying
[2:53:27] billy went and got him a coke or
[2:53:28] something and waiting around to see if
[2:53:31] his dad would be ready in a few minutes
[2:53:34] in a few minutes
[2:53:36] brother branham was down praying
[2:53:39] and he says i heard
[2:53:41] someone speaking
[2:53:43] in other tongues
[2:53:45] it sounded like german to me
[2:53:48] and he said i thought who is that german
[2:53:50] what are they saying
[2:53:52] and he says
[2:53:54] as i listened to it
[2:53:57] trying to hear the source it come from i
[2:54:00] realized he was coming out of my own
[2:54:02] mouth
[2:54:06] and he said after it finished after it
[2:54:09] got through
[2:54:10] the burden lifted and he went on to the
[2:54:13] meeting
[2:54:14] you know brother baxter as he was
[2:54:16] singing another song and whatever
[2:54:18] waiting he's i thought she wasn't coming
[2:54:21] he said well you know i i'm here and he
[2:54:23] gets up and he starts speaking
[2:54:26] and just as he gets through preaching at
[2:54:28] the end of the service
[2:54:30] a lady comes into church and she's
[2:54:32] shouting and screaming back there
[2:54:34] they run back with a microphone to see
[2:54:36] what it what what her deal was what what
[2:54:39] she was screaming about
[2:54:40] and she had been on her way to the
[2:54:42] meeting
[2:54:43] she had it was in an ambulance
[2:54:46] she had tuberculosis she started
[2:54:48] hemorrhaging in her lungs
[2:54:51] and that blood was just coming out
[2:54:53] and then she said i don't want to die in
[2:54:55] the sandwich get me out on the grass
[2:54:58] get me on the grass i'll die there but i
[2:54:59] don't want to die in this in this
[2:55:01] ambulance and they put her on the grass
[2:55:03] and as they were praying around her
[2:55:05] the bleeding suddenly stopped and she
[2:55:07] was healed
[2:55:10] and come to find out it was a very same
[2:55:12] time that brother branham was speaking
[2:55:14] in other tongues
[2:55:17] making the intercession
[2:55:20] what's wrong with that
[2:55:22] that's a new testament church
[2:55:26] amen that's what's supposed to be in the
[2:55:28] church we need the power of el salvador
[2:55:31] the almighty god to pray the prayer of
[2:55:34] intercession to refresh to strengthen to
[2:55:37] encourage us
[2:55:39] dear god we know we need encourage in
[2:55:41] this hour and when it is interpreted god
[2:55:44] will speak to it through it and and when
[2:55:47] it's spoken it will bless god in a
[2:55:49] heavenly language
[2:55:51] and that is given to us to nurse on
[2:55:54] until the body is changed
[2:55:57] the holy ghost is el shaddai that we are
[2:56:00] to drink of
