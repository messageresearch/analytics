[31:47] members here just United in holy
[31:51] matrimony amen and it's not in your
[31:54] maybe physical family our church family
[31:57] if you turn with me to Ephesians chapter
[31:59] 6 we want to read from verse 10 this
[32:02] morning Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10
[32:06] these subjects are very dear to my heart
[32:09] so I want you to keep in mind that we've
[32:12] been speaking on being Mountain movers
[32:15] so you know taking it from Zachariah
[32:18] said who art thou oh great Mountain Thou
[32:21] shalt become a plane and The Headstone
[32:25] shall be brought forth with shoutings
[32:27] crying Grace Grace unto it how many
[32:30] believes in the favor of God his grace
[32:33] that is so great on our lives Ephesians
[32:35] 61 finally my brethren be strong in the
[32:38] Lord and in the power of His might put
[32:41] on the whole armor of God that you may
[32:43] be able to stand against the Ws of the
[32:45] devil for we wrestle not against flesh
[32:48] and blood but against principalities
[32:51] against
[32:53] powers and against the rulers of the
[32:56] darkness of this World against spiritual
[33:00] wickedness in high places now this this
[33:03] is actually actually in the King James
[33:06] will use this word high in the place of
[33:08] heavenly which it uses in Ephesians
[33:11] chapter 1 we will read that a little
[33:13] later in the sermon so it's actually
[33:15] saying that we wrestle not against flesh
[33:17] and blood but against principalities
[33:19] against Powers against the rulers of
[33:20] Darkness of this world against spiritual
[33:22] wickedness in Heavenly places that's
[33:26] very interesting we want to look at this
[33:29] today as we as we focus in on the word
[33:33] now verse 13 says for you to take the
[33:35] whole armor of God that you may be able
[33:38] to withstand in the evil day and having
[33:41] done all to stand stand therefore if
[33:46] you'll look with me to Ephesians chapter
[33:49] 2 and verse one we'll just back up a
[33:52] couple of chapters as Paul deals with
[33:55] the Ephesian church and and it says and
[33:58] you hath he Quicken which is resurrected
[34:01] every every person who is Born Again of
[34:04] the spirit of God or spiritually
[34:06] resurrected or You're Made Alive who
[34:09] were dead that's your condition as being
[34:12] a sinner being in Lost in sin you were
[34:15] dead in sins and
[34:18] trespasses and wherein in time pass you
[34:22] walked according to the course of this
[34:24] world according to the prince of the
[34:27] power of the of the air the spirit that
[34:31] now worketh in the children of
[34:34] Disobedience among whom also we had our
[34:36] conversation that word is um is used by
[34:40] the King James but it's um it's it
[34:43] really means conduct the way we had our
[34:45] conduct in times past of the lust of in
[34:50] the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[34:52] desires of the Flesh and of the mind and
[34:55] were by Nature the children of wrath
[34:58] even as others God bless you you can be
[35:01] seated may he bless his word this
[35:03] morning we're going to be speaking today
[35:05] on on adopted Sons conquerors of the air
[35:10] now we we've seen in the scripture here
[35:14] that the Apostle Paul describes Satan
[35:19] first as a prince with power because he
[35:23] has authentic power in the world and
[35:27] then we
[35:28] we also know that in in 1 John
[35:32] 5:19 that John tells us we know we are
[35:36] from God and the whole world lies in the
[35:40] power of the evil one or the whole world
[35:44] Li in wickedness or in the power of the
[35:47] wicked one or the evil one so this is a
[35:50] condition that the world is in today and
[35:53] of course those that are redeemed have
[35:56] been redeemed and bought by God and
[36:00] purchased by his blood and brought out
[36:02] of the power of darkness and they are
[36:05] children of the light now if we notice
[36:09] of Satan um many times we we think of
[36:13] him as we see him in nature we see him
[36:17] stir up the the atmospheres above and he
[36:20] will cause winds and tornadoes and
[36:23] horrible storms now you know your
[36:25] insurance companies and others will to
[36:27] tell you that's an act of God but it's
[36:29] not an act of God it is an act of the
[36:32] devil and he stirs up the storms the
[36:35] winds um of Nature and he will even
[36:39] attack your own human nature and he will
[36:42] disturb our human nature and bring
[36:45] storms in our lives and and uh storms in
[36:48] our families and disturb our human
[36:51] nature and of course this will be by
[36:54] every kind of satanic attack which would
[36:57] be maybe up on our health or maybe uh in
[37:00] our mind whether there be spirits of
[37:03] insanity or which are spirits of
[37:06] Darkness but um not only that but but as
[37:10] the whole world lays in the power of the
[37:13] evil one we know that he owns the
[37:16] kingdoms of the world and even among
[37:19] nations he will stir up chaos and strife
[37:23] and he causes great suffering all over
[37:26] the world and uh and of course A lot of
[37:29] times people will will wonder um why
[37:32] does God allow the devil to do this well
[37:36] God made everything perfect he made
[37:39] everything where there was no sin there
[37:41] was no sorrow there was no never to be a
[37:44] grave on the earth it was it was to be
[37:47] Heaven on the earth and he gave Dominion
[37:50] of the earth to his son Adam and placed
[37:54] him in the garden and he was to he was
[37:58] to spread his domain from sea to Sea
[38:02] where the whole Earth would be covered
[38:04] with the glory of the Lord as the
[38:06] psalmist David said so this is always
[38:10] God's plan and ultimately that is God's
[38:14] plan he will again rule the Earth and
[38:18] not only just for the millennial reign
[38:20] of a thousand years but also he will
[38:23] make all things new he will he will make
[38:26] a new heavens and a new Earth where
[38:30] there will only dwell righteousness and
[38:33] there will there of course in that new
[38:35] Heavens new Earth there will never be a
[38:37] grave um to be turned over in that sod
[38:40] there will never be sickness there won't
[38:43] be hospitals the scientific Realms that
[38:46] we know today where man is trying to um
[38:50] do what he can to help um other mankind
[38:53] that well all of that will not be needed
[38:55] because it will be perfect peace perfect
[38:59] Joy perfect love permeating and an
[39:03] atmosphere of godliness all over the
[39:06] Earth even so much that the lion will
[39:09] lay down by the lamb and nothing will
[39:12] hurt or destroy as he says in all of my
[39:15] Holy Mountain but you see uh Satan right
[39:19] now owns the kingdoms of the world and
[39:22] and I'll just show you in Luke
[39:24] 4:4 that the devil took Jesus up a high
[39:28] mountain and showed him all the kingdoms
[39:30] of the world in a moment of time and and
[39:33] the devil said unto him all this power I
[39:37] give thee and the glory of them for that
[39:39] is delivered to me and to whomsoever I
[39:42] will give it so if you notice here um
[39:46] that he offers Jesus the kingdoms of the
[39:49] world because he owns the kingdoms of
[39:53] this world right now the Earth is not
[39:56] under God 's kingship but it's it's
[40:00] under the prince of the power of the air
[40:03] and how did he get this because he says
[40:06] as if you'll keep my scripture up a
[40:07] minute because he says all this power I
[40:10] will give thee and the glory of them
[40:12] because that is g delivered unto me so
[40:17] if you notice here um it's delivered to
[40:19] him because because man was given this
[40:23] power over the air over the atmosphere
[40:27] he he was he was to bring Heaven down
[40:30] upon the Earth and on the Earth would
[40:33] only be righteousness and peace and joy
[40:36] but when he sold himself out to sin and
[40:40] and became subservient to the devil then
[40:44] Satan took lordship over the the heart
[40:47] of man that's why it's important for
[40:50] salvation for you to re to reject the
[40:53] lordship of Satan and receive the
[40:55] lordship of Christ you see that he is
[40:59] your lord he because he is king of
[41:03] saints but right now he's not king of
[41:06] the world but he is coming as Revelation
[41:09] 19 shows him coming as the word of God
[41:13] and as he rides out the heaven
[41:15] symbolically on white horses and the
[41:17] Saints with him and he is king of kings
[41:20] and Lord of lords and and the armies of
[41:23] Heaven follow him and they're coming to
[41:25] take the world back over again
[41:27] so all of this is shown in the scripture
[41:30] and so it's only for a time that Satan
[41:34] has this rule over the Earth he as we
[41:37] have said is a temporary being he's not
[41:40] Eternal he he has an expiration date
[41:44] also everything that he brings whether
[41:47] it's sickness or whether it's sorrow or
[41:49] trouble or even death itself it all has
[41:52] an expiration date now so if we think of
[41:56] this Satan is the prince of the power of
[41:59] the air Jesus would acknowledge Him
[42:01] being the prince of this world and he
[42:05] said that it was now his time for the
[42:08] power of Darkness to rain and we're
[42:11] still in the time where the power of
[42:14] Darkness Reigns over the world in which
[42:17] we live that's why the evil is there
[42:20] that's why the the sickness the sin is
[42:23] there is because the power of the Prince
[42:26] of Darkness Reigns and he controls the
[42:29] air the atmospheres all around and he
[42:33] brings hate and envy and strife and and
[42:36] all the other awful works of the Flesh
[42:39] and he and he manifests himself and and
[42:43] Exhibits that as he takes himself over
[42:46] human beings to live in and work in that
[42:49] will do his bidding and and so the Bible
[42:53] says that he is the ruler or the uh the
[42:57] prin of the power of the air the NIV
[42:58] says it this way the rulers of the
[43:01] kingdoms of the air so his ugly Spirit
[43:06] controls the atmospheres of this Earth
[43:09] and he will even try to to rule the
[43:12] atmosphere of your flesh and even he'll
[43:16] even try to rule the atmosphere of the
[43:19] church he'll come right into a meeting
[43:22] to try to control the atmosphere to
[43:25] bring it under his power to keep it
[43:28] subdued to keep the worship of the true
[43:30] God to from entering in and the praise
[43:33] to be received up into the presence of
[43:36] God he will do everything he can to ward
[43:39] off the blessings of God to keep prayers
[43:42] from being answered to keep your faith
[43:45] in in a a low and and and and held down
[43:49] by unbelief because he knows as as long
[43:53] as your faith is bound by some unbelief
[43:57] by a spirit of Darkness then then you
[44:00] are powerless and he is able then to do
[44:03] whatever he wants to and he can run
[44:05] rampid over the children of God no
[44:08] matter how powerful the word is no
[44:10] matter how great it is no matter how
[44:13] Deliverance is in the word of God it is
[44:16] a sword but it has to be held by the
[44:18] hand of faith and if he can talk you out
[44:22] of of your faith of your using your
[44:25] weapon Amen to keep you from using the
[44:28] word of God against him you see then he
[44:31] can control the atmosphere of the church
[44:34] he can control the atmosphere of your
[44:37] life he can control the atmosphere of
[44:39] your family of your home of the of the
[44:42] world that we live
[44:44] in now from this position he will
[44:48] torment our bodies and bring accusations
[44:51] against us you see is a Tormentor that's
[44:54] what devil means he's a Tormentor Satan
[44:57] Satan has the power to bring
[45:00] sickness amen you see as as as Jesus
[45:04] said about a woman that was released
[45:07] from her prison House of Affliction
[45:10] being bound and crippled and and he says
[45:13] he said should not this daughter of this
[45:17] woman being a daughter of Abraham whom
[45:19] Satan is bound he 18 years be loose from
[45:23] this Bond on the Sabbath day because
[45:25] they were too worried about you know
[45:28] their their religious ceremony than they
[45:31] were about a someone who was bound for
[45:35] 18 years being delivered amen sometimes
[45:39] I wonder if we get too worried about our
[45:42] Theology and you know getting everything
[45:45] right and and the ever eye dotted and
[45:47] every tea crossed exactly perfectly we
[45:51] get too concerned even about church
[45:53] orders amen against all of these
[45:57] is too concerned about all these things
[45:59] until we forget our real purpose is to
[46:04] find that those that are bound those
[46:06] that are afflicted those that are
[46:09] tormented to find their Deliverance In
[46:12] The House of the Living God Amen this is
[46:15] what God has raised up a church for amen
[46:19] is to take dominion over Satan's kingdom
[46:23] to clear the air between The Sinner and
[46:26] God where that God can come down and
[46:28] flow in their lives and live his life
[46:32] through them instead of satanic Powers
[46:35] controlling
[46:36] them now as we think of this we also see
[46:42] Paul would talk about it being a thorn
[46:44] and we remember when man fell he talked
[46:48] about his sickness or whatever it was a
[46:50] messenger Satan that buffeted me you
[46:53] know and and he said so there was given
[46:55] me a thorn in the flesh I he he was he
[46:59] was permitted lest I be exalted lest
[47:02] that I become hearty in myself he says
[47:06] then then he said it was permitted down
[47:09] permission was given for a messenger of
[47:11] Satan to buff at me and it become a
[47:15] thorn in his flesh now I want you to
[47:18] understand this is exactly where that
[47:20] when man fell not only did the world
[47:23] fall not but all the kingdoms of the
[47:26] world fell
[47:27] all of the animal kingdom fell
[47:30] everything went into chaos Heaven became
[47:34] elusive Eden became lifted and and and
[47:37] become a mysterious place out of the
[47:40] reach of man and now man is living on
[47:43] the earth without heaven without the
[47:45] power of God without his faith being
[47:48] active without the the ability to
[47:51] control the World by the word of God so
[47:55] now all of this was happening in the
[47:57] world because man fell now I want you to
[48:02] understand the Bible said now to to him
[48:04] now your body you will bear the soil the
[48:09] Earth will bear thorns and
[48:12] thistles and remember yes of course
[48:16] nature itself rebelled against him where
[48:18] he earned his bread by the sweat of the
[48:21] brow now not operating in Dominion that
[48:24] he once operate but now now he he has
[48:28] got Thorns growing in his own body
[48:31] sickness comes and attacks him disease
[48:34] comes in and no matter who we are today
[48:37] we are subject to that because these
[48:40] flesh are mortal they are no longer
[48:43] Immortal when Adam was made he was made
[48:46] an immortal man but he gave up his
[48:50] immortality D to come under the Dominion
[48:52] of Satan and when death entered in hear
[48:56] the power of death had came into his had
[48:59] power over him and the Bible said in
[49:02] Hebrews 2:14 he said his children are
[49:05] partakers of the flesh and blood so he
[49:08] likewise took part of the same that
[49:11] through death he might destroy him that
[49:13] had the power of death that is the devil
[49:17] so you see Satan has the power of death
[49:20] how did he bring that power how was he
[49:22] given that power he was given that power
[49:25] when man becomes subservient to him when
[49:28] man surrendered the kingdom to
[49:33] him now so he is the prince of the power
[49:38] of the air meaning the atmosphere the
[49:41] air refers to the
[49:44] invisible but the it's a supernatural
[49:47] realm that is upon and above the Earth
[49:51] where Satan and his demons move and
[49:55] exist now it is this
[49:58] position this place that Adam ruled this
[50:02] Kingdom this was man's
[50:04] Dominion amen this is I I want you to
[50:07] know man was made to have control over
[50:12] dominion over the fish of the sea the
[50:15] foul of the air he was have dominion
[50:17] over the Earth he was able to bring
[50:20] Heaven's atmosphere down upon the earth
[50:23] and the love of God permeate everything
[50:26] and if you don't know what the love of
[50:27] God is it is the Holy Ghost the Holy
[50:30] Ghost would reign
[50:33] supreme and there animals did not kill
[50:36] each
[50:36] other men did not hate or fight there
[50:40] was no death no sorrow no fear no
[50:46] worry it was all perfect
[50:50] love remember that's God's basic nature
[50:53] he God is love and where God Reigns love
[51:01] Reigns
[51:04] now here he was brought Heaven's
[51:08] atmosphere of peace love joy into Eden
[51:12] and now when he becomes subservient to
[51:15] Satan and now Satan is the prince yeah
[51:19] he brings
[51:21] chaos
[51:22] sin
[51:24] destruction evil
[51:27] and the whole world is in a fallen
[51:30] condition and all of us come into this
[51:33] world needing a new
[51:38] birth cuz we were all born
[51:41] wrong so we would have to be born
[51:44] again now even now our battle your
[51:49] battle this morning is for dominion over
[51:55] atmospheres you
[51:57] your battle this morning is a is a
[51:59] battle over the air a battle over
[52:03] atmospheres now it is our position it is
[52:06] our Throne meaning our domain as sons of
[52:11] of God in the heavens position us with
[52:14] Christ it is there that Satan attacks
[52:17] our faith with within the the the
[52:20] atmosphere to change the the atmosphere
[52:23] of Faith to one of Doubt knowing I requ
[52:26] request and our petitions can only be
[52:29] received by God when we
[52:32] believe remember if thou can't believe
[52:36] all things are
[52:39] possible amen but nothing is possible
[52:42] with doubt that's doubt removes us from
[52:46] our sunship position and we lose our
[52:50] Authority and I I want you to understand
[52:53] this this this is war
[52:57] amen This Is War this is where we're at
[52:59] we're in a battle for
[53:02] atmospheres amen and as adopted Sons we
[53:05] are to be we are to be conquerors of the
[53:08] atmosphere conquerors of the
[53:10] air now so 2 Corinthians 10:3 says
[53:14] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[53:17] war according to the
[53:19] flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are
[53:22] not of flesh but have divine power to
[53:25] destroy stronghold they are Mighty
[53:28] through God to the pulling down of
[53:30] strongholds so you see they're not
[53:32] carnal But Mighty through God or they're
[53:35] they're they're not of the flesh but
[53:37] have divine power to pull down
[53:41] strongholds you know now Satan does this
[53:44] with
[53:45] arguments with reasoning with Wars
[53:49] against our mind doing everything to
[53:52] change our atmosphere from one of Faith
[53:56] to doubt to fear to failure and I I want
[54:00] you to know as a son or daughter of God
[54:03] you're not to be a people controlled by
[54:06] fear amen perfect love that's the Holy
[54:09] Ghost will cast out fear fear has
[54:12] torment so fear is of the devil that's
[54:15] right amen so God has not given us a a
[54:19] mind of fear but a disciplined mind a
[54:22] mind that is controlled by the Holy
[54:25] Spirit
[54:26] to believe what God's word said about
[54:32] us now Satan's tireless goal in the life
[54:37] of every Christian is to prevent disrupt
[54:41] cut off relationship with God this is
[54:45] what he
[54:50] does even this morning I don't care how
[54:53] great a Christian you
[54:55] are Satan is trying to disrupt your
[54:59] relationship with
[55:01] God he's trying to cut it
[55:04] off if he can do it by getting some
[55:07] doubt by bringing some
[55:10] accusation by allow by you allowing some
[55:13] fear to control you instead of Faith he
[55:17] will cut off your relationship with God
[55:20] and he prows the Bible said Peter said
[55:22] it around like a roaring line and he's
[55:25] looking for someone to to devour that's
[55:27] right so he's looking all the time and
[55:30] his only real power oh Believers is to
[55:32] throw sins and transgress transgresses
[55:36] transgressions in our faces that's his
[55:39] only real
[55:40] power it just just remind you of your
[55:44] failures remind you of your
[55:47] Humanity remind you of your faults
[55:51] remind you of of of where you didn't
[55:53] overcome or where you're still lacking
[55:55] some where because if he can get you to
[55:59] look at your lack instead of God's
[56:01] provision he has you
[56:04] defeated amen but if you will look away
[56:07] to Jesus this morning you will see
[56:09] yourself in the light of God's glory as
[56:12] a redeemed child of God a son of the
[56:16] Living God bur by the blood of Jesus
[56:19] Christ cleansed by his
[56:23] blood you see Satan knows if the people
[56:26] get the true revelation of that True
[56:29] Blood wash
[56:30] church and what she is and how she how
[56:34] she isn't right standing before God and
[56:37] I want you to understand it isn't
[56:38] because you've always done everything
[56:40] right that's amen it ain't because you
[56:43] never made a mistake you you he has he
[56:46] has plenty things that are real he don't
[56:48] even have to make it up he don't even
[56:50] have to lie against you though he will
[56:52] he will lie against you but he don't
[56:54] have to even make it up you've done
[56:56] enough
[56:56] wrong Amen to die a million deaths in
[57:02] hell every one of us have fallen
[57:05] short not one of us not one of us would
[57:09] be with without the blood of Christ
[57:11] could be perfect and without
[57:13] blemish amen but listen we stand before
[57:17] God Amen why they overcame him
[57:21] Revelation 12 says they overcame him by
[57:24] the blood of the Lamb this is our
[57:27] overcoming power amen is the
[57:35] blood nothing can stand before that
[57:37] blood no sin can stand before that blood
[57:41] no habit no devil no demon power can
[57:46] stand before the blood of
[57:49] Jesus so she stands before God when she
[57:53] can get that revelation of that she's
[57:55] Blood Washed
[57:57] and she stands perfect before God Amen
[58:00] and By and By by confessing his word by
[58:04] testifying what he said by staying true
[58:07] to his word and she can do the Greater
[58:10] Works it is then she'll be an invincible
[58:13] army they can get the true revelation of
[58:16] of of the two spirits that are within
[58:19] the framework of the Christian Church
[58:21] each trying to bring its atmosphere you
[58:25] see both spirit Spirits are at work here
[58:27] God trying to bring the atmosphere of
[58:30] love and faith amen of consolation a
[58:34] purity of righteousness and here the
[58:37] devil is over here trying to bring
[58:40] confusion and chaos and doubt and
[58:43] unbelief and a sense of
[58:49] unworthiness I I just want to tell you
[58:51] right now forget your unworthiness you
[58:53] are you can never be worthy
[58:56] but I want you to know because of the
[58:59] great price that Jesus Paid where he
[59:02] traded his righteousness for your sins
[59:06] then because of his righteousness you
[59:09] are can walk in white and you are
[59:14] worthy Hallelujah this is where he said
[59:16] in the Book of Revelation they walk
[59:19] before me and white and they are worthy
[59:26] well I'm not worthy to receive healing
[59:28] no not on your old flesh but as a as a
[59:32] born again son of daughter of God Amen
[59:35] it is your right it is your inheritance
[59:38] it is your privilege it is your
[59:43] sunship your access to
[59:46] father now but
[59:50] Satan is the
[59:52] accuser but we have to withstand him
[59:55] because it's only when we withstand him
[59:57] as sons of God that we that we that
[1:00:02] Satan will be powerless before us now as
[1:00:04] the
[1:00:05] accuser he comes over and over again and
[1:00:10] he will accuse to the day of the
[1:00:14] Rapture amen but thankfully the
[1:00:17] sacrifice of Christ has effectively
[1:00:20] dealt with the
[1:00:22] problem it's the blood of Jesus the
[1:00:24] blood of the Lamb that redeemed people
[1:00:26] setting them free from the slavery to
[1:00:28] sin and of Satan's control yet he
[1:00:31] attacks our faith our faith is our
[1:00:34] confidence our trust in the blood
[1:00:38] pointing out our lack our failures and
[1:00:41] reasoning against our faith attempting
[1:00:44] to turn hope into hopelessness for you
[1:00:47] to give up and to
[1:00:52] quit now Satan knows when the air is
[1:00:55] cleared between us us and God when
[1:00:58] nothing is between no doubting no
[1:01:02] wavering but steadfast believing then
[1:01:05] that's where mountains move that's where
[1:01:08] Red Seas open that's where sickness is
[1:01:11] healed that's where miracles
[1:01:15] happen amen when the air gets cleared
[1:01:18] between you and God nothing between no
[1:01:21] doubting no fear no
[1:01:24] unbelief amen
[1:01:26] but just where the Holy Spirit can
[1:01:28] Ascend and descend upon you where the
[1:01:31] spirit of God can come and anoint his
[1:01:33] word and make it real amen that's where
[1:01:37] Red Seas will open that's where
[1:01:40] mountains will move that's where every
[1:01:43] sickness has to bow to the name of Jesus
[1:01:46] that's where miracles
[1:01:50] happen now Paul brings a message to the
[1:01:52] mature Church of the Ephesians these
[1:01:55] were the adopted sons who he was placing
[1:01:59] firmly in their
[1:02:01] inheritance now I want you to get the
[1:02:03] thought now for a moment not adopted
[1:02:05] like adopting somebody else's kids as
[1:02:08] your own but no it goes this word
[1:02:12] adoption Paul is using is one on the old
[1:02:15] Roman custom of taking even your own son
[1:02:18] when he came to age and placing him
[1:02:22] putting the ring on his finger putting
[1:02:24] the putting the robe of Honor upon him
[1:02:27] giving him a name and authority over
[1:02:30] over the whole Kingdom and this is
[1:02:33] exactly what God is doing in this last
[1:02:35] day he is placing Sons putting a ring on
[1:02:39] their finger putting the Holy Ghost
[1:02:41] around them the robe of his
[1:02:43] righteousness is somebody with me amen
[1:02:47] dressing them honoring them naming them
[1:02:50] Hallelujah put him there making sure
[1:02:53] everybody knows this is my son
[1:02:56] whatever he says that's I back it up
[1:02:59] amen whatever he binds is bound whatever
[1:03:02] he looses is
[1:03:05] loosed amen Place Sons people who know
[1:03:09] their God and do
[1:03:13] exploits now let's go to the book of
[1:03:16] Ephesians chapter 1 we'll read from
[1:03:19] verse three if you will we're going to
[1:03:21] just search the
[1:03:24] scripture and let's just look at him
[1:03:27] where he places the
[1:03:29] Believers now of course Ephesians 1:1
[1:03:32] says he speaks to the Saints which are
[1:03:35] in Ephesus so he is addressing
[1:03:38] Saints so in verse three he said blessed
[1:03:41] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:03:43] Christ who has blessed us with
[1:03:49] all not
[1:03:50] some all spiritual blessings where where
[1:03:56] do our blessings lie in Heavenly
[1:04:01] places according as he is chosen Us in
[1:04:05] him when down at the

[1:04:12] church when when we found out we we were
[1:04:15] sons of God and we born again no before

[1:04:38] that amen you might have been controlled
[1:04:41] here for a while while you was here in
[1:04:43] sin but you never truly belonged to the
[1:04:45] devil you were God's before the world
[1:04:49] began he chose you in Christ before the
[1:04:52] foundational world and what did he

[1:05:40] that
[1:05:42] counts you were chosen to be holy and
[1:05:46] Without Blame

[1:06:24] that having predestinated us to the
[1:06:28] placing the adoption of children by
[1:06:30] Jesus Christ himself according to the
[1:06:33] good pleasure of his will so he pray

[1:08:00] just realize where your destiny

[1:09:01] we're not even talking about your
[1:09:03] flesh amen your your flesh your flesh we
[1:09:07] war against it every day bring it into
[1:09:10] subjection but remember the essence of
[1:09:12] the message that is given in this last
[1:09:15] day is truly another Ephesians to place
[1:09:19] us as sons and hirs of all
[1:09:23] things and by the word we have received
[1:09:26] by the handing us the unsealed book it
[1:09:30] places us as sons and we are
[1:09:33] commissioned in to act to speak to rule
[1:09:36] instead upon the Earth until he
[1:09:40] comes amen the Bible said he had made us
[1:09:43] under our Gods Kings and Priests you
[1:09:47] cannot be a king without having a domain
[1:09:50] and if you're a priest you have the
[1:09:52] right of intercession that whatever you
[1:09:54] ask his name he will do
[1:09:58] it
[1:09:59] now Paul prays in Ephesians chapter 1 17
[1:10:04] he prays that the god of our Lord Jesus
[1:10:08] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[1:10:12] you the spirit of wisdom and the
[1:10:14] Revelation and the knowledge of him now
[1:10:17] you're talking about here the spirit of
[1:10:19] wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge
[1:10:21] of him listen this is changing
[1:10:24] atmospheres
[1:10:26] given you not the spirit of
[1:10:29] Brokenness of Sorrow
[1:10:34] depression come on but the spirit of
[1:10:37] wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge
[1:10:40] of him changing your atmosphere the eyes
[1:10:44] of your understanding being
[1:10:47] enlightened amen this is what God's
[1:10:49] trying to do even get a message to you
[1:10:51] today you are to be rulers of the
[1:10:54] atmosphere
[1:10:55] of your
[1:10:56] life amen realize here I'm in right
[1:11:00] standing with God here's what the blood
[1:11:02] has done for me look the eyes of your
[1:11:04] understanding being enlightened that you
[1:11:05] may know the hope of his
[1:11:08] calling and what the riches of the glory
[1:11:11] of his inheritance in the Saints so you
[1:11:14] see this this is what the first age
[1:11:17] messenger Paul and the last Messenger to
[1:11:20] Leo deia both want you to know they want
[1:11:23] you to know you're rich
[1:11:27] inheritance they want you to know the
[1:11:29] hope of your
[1:11:31] calling your identity in Christ what he
[1:11:35] have made
[1:11:39] you amen now under the law we could only
[1:11:43] be servants we were
[1:11:47] slaves amen even though potentially we
[1:11:50] were Sons we were slaves we were we were
[1:11:53] slaves to sin we were slaves even under
[1:11:56] the law but under grace we are born
[1:11:59] Sons Acts 17:28 says for in him we live
[1:12:03] and move for we are also his
[1:12:07] offspring so we are The Offspring of God
[1:12:11] now so here the the Glorious riches that
[1:12:15] there are to God as his sons that that
[1:12:17] you're
[1:12:18] valuable God wants to you to know you
[1:12:21] are valuable that you are worthy
[1:12:26] amen that and that the power that God
[1:12:30] wants you to know the power that is at
[1:12:32] work at work in
[1:12:36] you amen notice not just any power not
[1:12:40] just a little bit of power but
[1:12:43] definitely not your human power and
[1:12:44] ability that's all limited but in verse
[1:12:47] 19 and what is the exceeding greatness
[1:12:52] of his power toward us who believes
[1:12:54] according to the working of his mighty
[1:12:57] power what's his mighty power which he
[1:13:00] wrought in Christ when he raised him
[1:13:02] from the dead and set him at his own
[1:13:04] right hand in Heavenly places now Christ
[1:13:07] did this as a
[1:13:09] man come on he put aside his godship to
[1:13:16] come and be a man to walk as a man to
[1:13:18] suffer as a man to suffer like we suffer
[1:13:22] to to be tempted like we're tempted
[1:13:25] somebody help me preach this is exactly
[1:13:28] the way God came in Christ right he laid
[1:13:32] aside his
[1:13:34] robes left the left all the heaven to
[1:13:37] come down to earth oh think of it his
[1:13:41] work is to intercede until all men are
[1:13:45] exalted to Heavenly places to positions
[1:13:49] of
[1:13:50] sunship you know and I want you to get
[1:13:53] it now this this place don't don't think
[1:13:55] of oh somewhere outer space or some way

[1:14:08] position Heavenly position as a son as a
[1:14:13] daughter of God here upon the Earth in
[1:14:16] the position of sunship this is this is
[1:14:19] what he came to do exalt you to Heavenly

[1:21:07] hallelujah amen Satan is nothing but a
[1:21:14] bluff now Paul said we wrestle not
[1:21:18] against flesh and blood so our fight
[1:21:20] isn't in the physical it's spiritual
[1:21:23] it's against the rulers against the
[1:21:25] authorities against the cosmic powers of
[1:21:28] this present Darkness against the
[1:21:31] spiritual forces of evil in high places
[1:21:36] Heavenly places so you know it was like
[1:21:40] in the days of job God would say to
[1:21:44] Satan where you been he said from going
[1:21:46] up go to and fro in the earth walking up
[1:21:49] and down on
[1:21:51] it now remember the Earth was not
[1:21:54] created for the
[1:21:55] Devil the Earth was created for us it
[1:21:59] was for our
[1:22:01] pleasure it was for us to live on you
[1:22:04] say well one day we're going to go away
[1:22:06] to heaven and we won't need this Earth
[1:22:08] anymore no that ain't scripture Heaven
[1:22:10] is only a temporary place that we go to
[1:22:14] until the last one is redeemed and then
[1:22:16] we come back on the
[1:22:17] earth is that right for the great
[1:22:20] Millennial Reign then we're caught up
[1:22:22] onto the Breath of Heaven for a bit
[1:22:24] while the Earth is purged and will will
[1:22:27] will come do not rule and reign with
[1:22:29] Christ a thousand years but there will
[1:22:31] be no end that's right to the rule of
[1:22:34] God on the earth with God and his bride
[1:22:38] will rule upon this Earth but right now
[1:22:43] the battle is over your
[1:22:47] Earth and his only
[1:22:49] weapon is to reason against God to
[1:22:53] accuse God and accuse you listen this
[1:22:58] accuser he's bold he'll stand right in
[1:23:01] the face of God and call him a
[1:23:05] liar he'll stand right there in the face
[1:23:08] of God and and say yeah job and accuse
[1:23:12] job and say hey he only serves God for a
[1:23:16] reason because you put a hedge around
[1:23:18] him but I tell you let me let me touch
[1:23:21] him let me touch his possessions he'll
[1:23:24] deny
[1:23:26] you then he comes again and and he said
[1:23:29] well you know a man to do anything for
[1:23:32] his skin let me touch his
[1:23:36] flesh you see there again he comes to
[1:23:40] accuse he accuse God of of lying he he
[1:23:43] accuse God of of even being deceitful he
[1:23:47] will accuse God even before God's
[1:23:49] children he said to Eve he said you want
[1:23:52] you know God really is lying to you
[1:23:53] about this deal you if you eat of this
[1:23:55] you he you know he'll you'll be like
[1:23:59] him and he accused God of lying about
[1:24:02] the whole
[1:24:04] thing you see Satan is an
[1:24:07] accuser and he's there to not just
[1:24:11] accuse God but to accuse
[1:24:15] you and his only weapon is to reason
[1:24:20] against God to accuse his word
[1:24:25] of not coming to
[1:24:27] pass amen and to accuse
[1:24:31] you of your
[1:24:34] failures therefore you're unworthy to
[1:24:37] receive
[1:24:38] this now Satan is there to resist us and
[1:24:42] every time we rise to a position of
[1:24:45] sunship he's there to oppose us to try
[1:24:48] to keep our petition from the Throne of
[1:24:50] God listen we know when the church go
[1:24:54] goes up according to Revelation 12 when
[1:24:57] the bride of Christ goes up in the great
[1:24:59] Rapture ahead that Satan is cast out why
[1:25:03] all his accusing will be done right now
[1:25:07] we have an intercessor that is still on
[1:25:09] the throne and Satan can stand there and
[1:25:12] accuse because he's the attorney on the
[1:25:14] other side he's the opponent of Christ
[1:25:18] and he's standing there you know the
[1:25:20] opponent is standing there saying but
[1:25:22] wait Adam fell Adam did this yes I
[1:25:25] conquered him I got his wife to believe
[1:25:26] a lie and you said she would be damned
[1:25:29] by it and these are his children and
[1:25:30] they're all damned they're under my
[1:25:32] control they're under my
[1:25:35] dominion and Jesus says but they were
[1:25:38] mine before you got
[1:25:41] them that I chose them before the
[1:25:43] foundation of the world they were mine
[1:25:46] back then I have diverse claim on them
[1:25:50] and not only that my blood was shed for
[1:25:52] them and I paid
[1:25:54] a debt I didn't ow cuz they owed a debt
[1:25:58] they couldn't pay amen and I paid their
[1:26:01] debt and their sin that is paid the debt
[1:26:05] for their unbelief is
[1:26:07] paid oh Hallelujah if we can just get it
[1:26:10] friend for a moment the accuser is
[1:26:12] standing there but the mediator is
[1:26:14] standing there the kinsman redeemer
[1:26:16] standing there with the blood that can
[1:26:18] take the vious sinner's heart and change
[1:26:22] the atmosphere of it

[1:26:28] Christ Satan is says they're guilty
[1:26:31] Jesus says but they're
[1:26:34] not amen now as he said in future home
[1:26:40] both the heavens and the earth now is
[1:26:41] contaminated with Devils that accuse us
[1:26:44] before
[1:26:45] God Jesus is there to intercede for us
[1:26:49] while the accuser keeps pointing the
[1:26:51] fingers saying they did this they did
[1:26:53] this they did death but the blood still
[1:26:56] covers he came to redeem that elected
[1:26:58] that he
[1:27:00] foresaw oh my and that's why it's so
[1:27:03] filthy today because the heavens and the
[1:27:06] Earth is contaminated with Devils that
[1:27:08] accuse us before God let me tell you
[1:27:11] what this
[1:27:12] means Paul was saying we are not
[1:27:15] wrestling against flesh and
[1:27:17] blood but against principalities and
[1:27:21] powers and spiritual wickedness
[1:27:25] that every time you try to rise up as a
[1:27:28] Son of God he's there to knock you
[1:27:31] down This Means
[1:27:34] War that means we are in a
[1:27:37] battle that means there is war going on

[1:30:00] Spirit to take lordship over your life
[1:30:03] to be the king of your heart that's what
[1:30:05] real salvation is it is the the throning
[1:30:07] of Satan from the life of a sinner and
[1:30:11] changing them and and opening up an
[1:30:14] atmosphere between them and God where
[1:30:17] the Holy Spirit can Ascend and descend
[1:30:20] upon them notice to open their eyes to
[1:30:23] turn them from Darkness to light from
[1:30:26] the power of Satan unto God that they
[1:30:28] may receive forgiveness of sins and
[1:30:31] inheritance among them which are
[1:30:33] Sanctified by faith that is in me notice
[1:30:38] to
[1:30:39] receive forgiveness of sins and
[1:30:43] inheritance among them which are
[1:30:46] Sanctified this is true salvation it
[1:30:49] turns us from Darkness to light and from
[1:30:54] the power of Satan to to God look in
[1:30:58] Colossians 1:12 giving thanks unto the
[1:31:01] Father which has made us meat to be
[1:31:04] partakers of the inheritance of the
[1:31:07] saint and
[1:31:09] light who had delivered us from the
[1:31:14] power of
[1:31:15] Darkness amen now he didn't just deliver
[1:31:19] you from the power of Darkness but he
[1:31:21] done something else he translated
[1:31:26] us into the kingdom of his dear
[1:31:33] son Hallelujah you already have if
[1:31:36] you're a Believer this morning you've
[1:31:37] already had a translation you were
[1:31:40] delivered from the power of darkness and
[1:31:43] removed from there under the Dominion of
[1:31:46] hell and darkness and now he have
[1:31:49] translated you into the kingdom of his
[1:31:52] son in whom we have Redemption through
[1:31:56] his
[1:31:57] blood even the Forgiveness of sins so
[1:32:01] you see here again this is what we have
[1:32:04] in his kingdom Redemption to his blood
[1:32:07] and forgiveness of sin so he actually
[1:32:10] bought
[1:32:12] us cuz we were sold by our first parents
[1:32:16] into
[1:32:17] sin and Jesus came to buy us to pay
[1:32:23] Redemption price to shed his blood in
[1:32:27] order to redeem you from sin Hallelujah
[1:32:31] so that you would have forgiveness of
[1:32:35] sins being right standing between you
[1:32:37] and God now so this this realm called
[1:32:44] the air is the atmosphere above it can
[1:32:48] you you're your your life there's even
[1:32:51] an atmosphere of your life and it's even
[1:32:55] this this Kingdom that Satan has can be
[1:32:59] synonymous with the world that Satan is
[1:33:01] ruling his Prince of this world and the
[1:33:03] whole world is Satan under Satan's
[1:33:05] domain this is why if you love the world
[1:33:09] or the things of the world the love of
[1:33:11] the father is not in you so it's a vital
[1:33:13] importance that you keep the atmosphere
[1:33:16] of your mind and your heart right that
[1:33:19] is that comes an opening of the way
[1:33:21] where the Holy Spirit can come and and
[1:33:24] and abide within you notice you as we
[1:33:28] remember now Adam once operated from
[1:33:30] this realm but he lost it because of the
[1:33:35] fall but Jesus came to clear the
[1:33:40] air the atmosphere between God and
[1:33:46] man I want you to remember even where he
[1:33:49] died he did not die on the earth and he
[1:33:53] didn't die in the heavens he died on the
[1:33:56] cross between Heaven and
[1:33:59] Earth amen Jesus said I'm going to make
[1:34:02] a
[1:34:04] way amen I'm going to make a way I'm
[1:34:06] going to be the path I am the way the
[1:34:09] truth the life I'm making a path right
[1:34:12] back to God right into his presence
[1:34:14] again where that heaven can flow right
[1:34:17] down into your heart and the kingdom of
[1:34:19] God can be in
[1:34:21] you Hallelujah I'm talking about kingdom
[1:34:24] airs this morning amen listen Jesus came
[1:34:27] to clear the air between God and man
[1:34:31] amen in his death he first he goes to
[1:34:37] hell when Jesus died he took every sin
[1:34:41] that there ever was with
[1:34:44] him amen the Bible said he became sin
[1:34:47] for us he knew no sin but it became sin
[1:34:51] and he took every sin with him
[1:34:54] to
[1:34:56] Hell come
[1:34:58] on amen he paid the price
[1:35:02] completely that's right amen and he did
[1:35:05] what while he was there he he did did
[1:35:09] what he actually
[1:35:11] transferred all sin back on the head of
[1:35:15] the
[1:35:17] devil that's why you who are redeemed
[1:35:20] will never answer to God for your sins
[1:35:24] because through the blood of Jesus and
[1:35:26] the bleach of that blood it has changed
[1:35:29] every chemistry of it and is it went
[1:35:32] back in the time and it went Falls all
[1:35:34] the way back on the head of the accuser
[1:35:36] himself and one day Satan will be will
[1:35:40] perish in hell for every
[1:35:44] [Applause]
[1:35:51] sin Hallelujah
[1:35:54] now man was held by
[1:35:57] death and but Jesus went to those who
[1:36:00] were in paradise and he emptied paradise
[1:36:04] and they resurrected with him and
[1:36:06] ascended with
[1:36:08] him brother when he did they went into
[1:36:10] his presence that's the Rapture of the
[1:36:13] Old Testament the Bible said in Matthew
[1:36:15] chapter 28 that many of the Saints which
[1:36:17] slept arose and appeared unto many with
[1:36:20] Jesus at his resurrection
[1:36:23] now this is very important because he
[1:36:28] not only died buried went to hell paid
[1:36:32] for our sins raised up them and
[1:36:35] resurrected with them but he also
[1:36:40] ascended now this Ascend Ascension is
[1:36:44] one of the greatest
[1:36:46] days now I I I realize we put a lot of
[1:36:49] emphasis on Calvary and and on the cross
[1:36:53] and what Jesus did for that but if Jesus
[1:36:56] just rose up just to live a normal life
[1:36:59] it would have been
[1:37:01] nothing he came from
[1:37:04] Heaven God left heaven to come to Earth
[1:37:09] as a man to defeat sin in the
[1:37:14] flesh to conquer the devil and him that
[1:37:18] had the power of of of death to conquer
[1:37:22] him
[1:37:24] right and he rose up but his work wasn't
[1:37:28] through he has now to clear a channel
[1:37:32] between God and man
[1:37:37] again now ever since that day in Eden
[1:37:42] that sin was committed all of heaven was
[1:37:45] shut off from
[1:37:46] mankind Satan the prince of the power of
[1:37:49] the air remember it says how art thou
[1:37:52] fallen from Heaven oh Lord Lucifer and
[1:37:54] you see you see Heaven that became
[1:37:58] blocked off from
[1:38:01] man the the the realm of perfection the
[1:38:04] realm of love the the realm of uh the
[1:38:08] Beauty and the Holiness of God becomes
[1:38:11] black off and and we become under the
[1:38:13] power of the Prince of Darkness and the
[1:38:15] light that man lived in of the glories
[1:38:18] of God now were covered with the power
[1:38:20] of Darkness
[1:38:23] and nobody could could could penetrate
[1:38:27] that because of that power just above us
[1:38:30] that the heaven means the atmosphere
[1:38:32] above and all these Powers were shut off
[1:38:35] from mankind because of
[1:38:38] sin and so you see every kind of thing
[1:38:42] as as a every Spirit now the atmosphere
[1:38:46] between man and God becomes darkened and
[1:38:49] demon powers now controlling the world
[1:38:52] controlling the Earth
[1:38:54] animals that once lived in Harmony and
[1:38:56] peace now begin to kill each other man
[1:39:00] even even begins to murder each other
[1:39:02] and we have the first murder in Cain all
[1:39:06] of this begins to happen chaos BEC
[1:39:08] Darkness covers the earth and and and
[1:39:12] that access between God and man was
[1:39:15] broken and the atmosphere was clouded
[1:39:18] with every kind of demon
[1:39:20] power amen and because the you see the
[1:39:24] here all these powers that accused now
[1:39:28] won't let God and man Fellowship anymore
[1:39:32] it become that Fellowship became broken
[1:39:34] and Eden sin done it and the domain of
[1:39:37] the earth became Satan it belonged to
[1:39:40] the devil but there that day when Jesus
[1:39:45] ascended I want you to get this he came
[1:39:48] as the anointed high
[1:39:51] priest Hallelujah Christ with his own
[1:39:54] blood as a high priest Anointed with the
[1:39:57] power of God raised from the dead and
[1:40:00] broke through the domain of
[1:40:03] Satan hallelujah oh brother he had
[1:40:06] already come down from the heavens of
[1:40:09] heavens and come to the lowest of the
[1:40:11] earth and but now he's received into
[1:40:14] heaven and God said him there Upon A
[1:40:17] Pinnacle that he has to look down to see
[1:40:19] Heaven no wonder he's a mighty conqueror
[1:40:22] as he stands there in that domain

[1:50:55] forth amen and let me tell you church if
[1:50:57] we can get in the right
[1:50:59] atmosphere Even in our church what do
[1:51:02] you think was happening in the upper

[1:51:07] him because they were looking toward a
[1:51:09] Divine promise carry you in Jerusalem
[1:51:12] until you're endued with power of on

[2:03:23] accusing maybe accusing God of not
[2:03:25] keeping his
[2:03:27] word of not fulfilling his
[2:03:30] promise may be accused and saying ah
