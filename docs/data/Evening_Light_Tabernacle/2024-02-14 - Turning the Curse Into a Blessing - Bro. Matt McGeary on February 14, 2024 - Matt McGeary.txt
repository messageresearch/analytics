else could make a way for us we were lost in sin without any hope Lord but you saw us and you made a way that we could be forgiven that we could be restored Lord and you've brought us to this place tonight Lord may we just allow the cares of this world now just to fade away Lord we're living in such an age of so much pressure just pulling on us here and there and Lord we we just want to be able to lay all that down now and say Lord what would you speak to my heart tonight Lord we we have a lot of needs that are here Lord we we have needs in the body spiritual needs there's sickness there's ones that need Deliverance Lord we have nowhere else we can go but to you and we're thankful Lord that when you went to Calvary you paid the penalty for our sins and you were beaten Lord for our healing you stretch stretched forth your arms on that cross and you said it's finished Lord thank you want to tell you Lord tonight thank you for doing that for us you didn't have to but you did and so now Lord we just want to take a little time we've sung the songs pray it's been pleasing to you knowing that you're in our midst now and just ask that you'd come and break the bread of life as only you can we love you Lord we just commit ourselves to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen praise the Lord man if you have your Bibles we'll be reading out of Deuteronomy uh chapter 23 we want to uh thank brother Tim for the opportunity to come and uh minister to you uh it's always good to be amongst friends and amongst family and so we're just looking forward to what the Lord would have for us um you know I I don't know about you but maybe maybe some of you had a little hard time trying to get to the house of God tonight anybody you know the devil's always fighting he's always Waring against you and and you know we're we're trying to have some meetings uh this weekend back home and you know when things start to stir up and it seems like things are maybe getting pulled this way and that way and things are getting disrupted and it seems like man I can't even make it to the house of God you might as well just get excited might as well start saying you know what obviously God has something in store for me because the devil is really fighting against this so I'm just great expectation for what the Lord would have for us uh just reading here in Deuteronomy uh chapter uh 23 and verse five just a short scripture reading it says nevertheless the Lord thy God would not hearken unto balum but the Lord thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee because the Lord thy God loved thee amen we ask a blessing upon the reading of the word you may be seated I I just had this quote in my Bible I I didn't plan on reading it but it was so good I couldn't pass it up uh the prophet of God would say and why are people so tossed about he says the Christian faith is based solidly upon rest that's right a Christian is not tossed about a Christian doesn't run from place to place a Christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things a Christian rest it's all over it's all finished for the believer at Calvary that's right oh sickness may come and disappointments but the Christian is at rest knowing this that God is able to keep that which he has performed knowing that no matter what the thing and how it looks there is neither sickness sorrow death there is neither starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of God that's in Jesus Christ we're at rest Just Let The Old Ship toss any way she wants to The Anchor Holds aren't you thankful for the anchor you know something in the heart of a Believer no matter what comes your way uh there's an anchor and maybe just to pull this uh text into uh give you some perspective here just reading out of the per pergami and church uh age uh the prophet would say so Israel came up to the borders of Moab and sent Messengers to the king saying we are brothers let us pass through your land if our people or animals eat or drink anything we will glad pay for it but the king Balo got very excited that the head of the nickel and bunch was not about to let that church come through with its signs and wonders and diverse manifestations of the Holy Ghost with their faces shining with the glory of God it was too risky as he might lose some of his crowd so Bayo refused to let Israel pass through in fact so great was his fear of them that he went to a hireling prophet called balam and asked him to mediate between him and God and petition Almighty to curse Israel and render them impotent and balum being eager to take part in political Affairs and become a great man was only too glad to do so but seeing that he had to approach to and receive an audience from God to get the people cursed as he could not do it by himself he went to ask God if he could have his permission to go now isn't that just like the nickel adans we have with us today they curse everyone that won't go their way uh but I want you to take notice in our text it says God would not hearken unto balam but the Lord God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee uh by the help of God I'd like to just speak to you this evening on turning the curse into a blessing and I want to just look at the scripture right out here in the beginning why did he do it why why did he turn the curse into a blessing because he loved you and I think maybe that might be just a good way to start the service tonight is just to start to think about the love of God that God loves you he he he he he he has your best interest in mind you might not feel like he does but God is looking out unto you with compassion he wants to take care of you he he he wants to Bear you up he wants to minister to your needs God loves you you know and that first Urgent Cry came uh from the garden of that Adam and Eve had fallen you know they had broke the Commandment of God and now they they were coming under the Judgment of God and as he was driving there from the Garden of Eden uh the prophet of God would dramatize it there uh they were going out with them sheep skims just beating against their legs and that the dripping blood uh uh uh uh dripping down them but there was something uh funneling down l e that wasn't willing to see them go out in that condition and God said I'll put enmity between thy seed and the woman's seed promising of the Savior see he wasn't willing to leave his children in that condition he was going to make a way he didn't want to see them living under the curse he didn't want to see them living under the penalty of sin so he made a way that they could be delivered he made a way that they could be forgiven oh the love of God have you ever experienced it I mean it it's hard to even fathom it if it's just a church story to you and and maybe it's just something that's talked about at church I say why don't you start to ask God if if there's such a thing why don't you show your love to me cuz there's nothing like it oh oh when you're in need and you're in bondage and and you don't know where to go and you don't know what to think and you feel like you're going to have a mental breakdown and the love of God comes to you and he he wraps his arms around you and he tells you that you're my son and I love you all he'll be a fatherless to the fatherless he'll be a husband to the widow or he'll be it'll be whatever you have need of tonight if you'll just open up your heart and say Lord here I am Show Your Love unto me oh God I'm seeking your face I have a need [Applause] tonight Lord I want to bring your attention to Deuteronomy chapter 30 and verse 19 it says I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life yes that both you and thy seed may live you have a choice that you can make tonight you you you can choose the condition and feel like there's no way out or you can look to a promise you can choose life and we know that the Old Testament was law was just a shadow of the New Testament obey the word and be blessed disobey the word and be cursed the prophet of God would say this and putting on the whole Army say many people just take taken the letter the letter kth but the spirit giveth life life see and they take their Creeds and so forth still kth but when you are taking the spirit that's God himself how do you know it's God because he taking the word and manifesting it see then it's God himself oh my spoken word yes sir look many people many churches say they believe the word many people say they believe the message many people Proclaim uh that they're Christians and that there's Believers but I want to ask you where's the life where is the spirit because the prophet is pointing out if you believe the word well the word is one thing if you believe the letter but the letter kth but there has to come something else there has to come the spirit to make that word live because if you're only laying claim to a letter if you're only laying claim to the books and and the tapes and just what's been written out there then it's going to kill but if you want to say oh God I need the spirit of Christ to come and Quicken the word that the quickening power can be found in me and make this word live look there's no other way to do it the flesh profiteth you nothing you're not going to be able to Manifest this message on your own it's going to have to come from something from somewhere a power come from somewhere to Quicken that word to you and to bring it into manifestation Jesus said it's the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing I don't know about you but has anybody found out that the flesh don't profiteth you anything right if you've lived on this Earth long enough it don't take long to find out that this old bag of bones can't profit anything you just mess everything up you can try to bring to pass the word of God you can try to live the message you can try not to cut your hair you can wear long dresses and all of that you you might look like the the greatest example of a message believer but in that state the letter kth yeah it takes more than your good effort it takes more than your works because the flesh profit you nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life I say if I have a choice t i I choose life I choose the spirit I I love the word I love the message but I want the life of the message I want the spirit of the message I want it to come into me I want to see it in manifestation I want to see it in power I don't want to just leave it on a book I don't want to just leave it on a tape I don't want to leave it in some prayer line back in the 60s I want to see the same God the same power the same manifestations in my body in my church in my family right here right now today not tomorrow not some other week we're not even guaranteed tomorrow we have tonight and I say why not tonight oh God pour your spirit out upon the Believers I want to see those word in full manifestation and in power in you and in you and in you why it's been [Applause] promised the question is what are you following you must choose your leader choose today you choose life or death your choice will determine your Eternal destination what you choose remember Jesus said follow me and you're invited to do so yes and to follow him to eternal life you must come on his terms that's right the word not upon the Creed not upon the public opinion we got a lot of public opinion nowadays not upon a so-called message opinion lot of opinions out there not upon what anybody else thinks about it but on what God said about it what God said about it see Satan's always wanting to cause doubt that's what he's been doing from the very beginning hath God not said right I I wonder why we are so quick to reason amongst ourselves with the word of God look if the prophet said it I believe it if it's laying in the I don't care where it's at if it's 47 to 65 I don't care if he said it I believe it if he said these signs shall follow them that believe I believe it if he said in my name you shall cast out evil spirits you say shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I believe it but the devil wants to sit there and be the skeptic and say well you prayed for so and so and they weren't healed I'm not looking at results as some type of vindication for what God Said cuz God meant what he said because I pray for somebody and they're not healed doesn't mean God's a [Applause] liar it only means I'm going to stand there and continue to believe because I have a promise ain't that what Abraham did when all the Skeptics and everybody said Abraham what are you doing he said I have a promise but we got to choose what we're following to choose what we're listening to we got to choose what we're giving our ear to Satan's over here just trying to get you to doubt cause you to believe God's word you go through trials and you go through heartaches and you go through pain and the Satan tries to come along and tell you that God's Not A A Healer God doesn't love you God God God doesn't care for you come on that's his tactic that's exactly what he did with the prophet when the prophet was going through the most trying hour of his whole life there his wife had been taken from him his baby had been taken from him and there he's he's pleading for his baby he's asking God cuz now his his sharing Rose is being taken from he's like Lord will you H he felt like a black curtain came down like God would him hear his prayer he come way too late to tell brother brandom that that God uh wasn't a Healer that God wasn't real he come way too late to tell me I I've seen the transforming power of God I know what I used to be glory come too late to tell me yes amen but he has a way of working on your mind you in your flesh you get weak you you feel like you've been bearing this burden so long and under the weight of the pressure then he kind of slips in and says you know what he really don't love you and it was in that moment brother brandham thought you know what he said you look he he you know your your brother's died and this family memb died and that member and all you've done if you've labored all this and he really doesn't love you and he's just like you know what if that's how it is and he was about to throw in the tow but there was something there that was keeping him there was something there that was holding him don't you realize that in your life it's not you keeping yourself but there is something there I want to say that's the only reason you're here tonight is there has been something keeping you something holding you something over your life that's been watching out over you that's been protecting you that's been bringing you to this place where you are now not something you can do it's something that God has already [Applause] done but we go through our tests we go through our trial the prophet would say and how can I overcome he says he that cometh to God must first be tested what with the word that's God's test do you believe it he that cometh to God must be tested that only shows a true child then see be tested and when the test comes you can't overcome listen now you can't overcome L there's a test give to you and when the test is given it's to see whether you can overcome or not and Jesus said to him that overcometh the test the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you well you might not feel like what are you talking about it's the greatest thing that ever happened to me sure doesn't feel like it it sure doesn't look like it you feel like you've been Waring and battling this for so long for so many years you feel like you can't go in any further you can't go on and you're trying to tell me this is the best thing that ever happened to me you got a choice to make tonight you can take God at his word and say Lord if you say that's the greatest thing that ever happened to me then I'm going to praise you oh watch out the devil hates that now the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you I believe it's written in the scripture Peter said that our Tri are worth more to us than precious gold it's a testing time it's one good evidence to us that God is with us when we're tested for all children of God are tested and tried all God's children are tested and tried and the trial is the greatest thing that ever happened happen to you you know when when the Hebrew children were about to be thrown into the fiery furnace I I don't necessarily think they were walking along saying you know what guys I think this is the greatest thing that ever happened to us I mean tell you what we we couldn't have asked for any can you believe this we are being escorted by the guards to a fiery furnace under the King's Command I tell you what this is all my hopes and all my dreams I was just hoping this would happen awesome I mean I tell you what I I just was wondering Lord what could be the greatest thing that ever happened in my life and I was like ha no it didn't feel that way it didn't look that way but what were they doing they had a promise they had a word and they said you know what I'm not going to go I'm not going to bow down to the God of this evil age oh King live forever look I if if God delivers us he'll Deliver us if he don't he don't but whatever you do I'm not bowing down to to your image I'm not bowing down to Satan's inen I'm not going to give up and say God's Not A Healer I'm not going to come down under the test and say you know what well God didn't mean what he said no God meant what he said and it's in the test in the trial when it's the greatest thing that ever happened to you I I don't know how the whole scene unfolded but I could just imagine them uh uh walking them down there could have been people rallying around wagering bets how do you how close do you think they'll get to the furnace man I don't know the last guys didn't get with 50 ft of it and it was only heated twice it's seven times how much you got on it they don't make 100t close to that thing now all of a sudden the guards are dropping and they're still walking what is going on here they got closer to the other guys you see it was in the trial it was in the test didn't look like it was the greatest thing that ever happened but it was in the fire there was a fourth man sounds like a pretty great thing when the king looked down there I thought we threw only three in there I like that story about the footprints on the Sands of TI said Lord I looked back through my life and I wondered there there we were walking together but when I got to my lowest hours when I got to my darkest night I only see one foot of set of one set of footprints why did you leave me in my darkest hour yeah when I felt all alone I felt I couldn't take another step I I I felt I couldn't cry another tear I thought I was going to lose my mind I was ready to give up I was ready to throw in the towel I couldn't take it any longer why did you leave me oh son oh daughter amen that's not I didn't leave you that's when I was carrying you those Footprints you see are me bearing you up and holding you I've been carrying you I've been bringing you through it's in those greatest trials and those greatest hours that God manifest himself to the believer that God is proving his word in your life see if it was in your own efforts if it was in your own ability you would have given up a long time ago You' have thrown in the towel a long time ago you'd have say it's just my time to go I don't think I can go on any longer but something has been keeping you something has been carrying [Applause] you right it was in that fire that Jesus Christ came on the scene amen yeah I think of the children of Israel you would have thought that a after all the Miracles and all the things that they had seen here God brought them out by a mighty hand right and now now they they they've come out of Egypt they're at the Red Sea and and once again they're murmuring and complaining oh Moses did you bring us out here to die you know watch The Mighty hand of the Lord he and now he he Parts the Red Sea and they they go through on dry land destroys all their enemy now they get out in the wilderness and once again they're thirsty they're they're starting to murmur they're starting to complain they have needes like Moses did you bring us out here to die right is that what we do as mature Christians when when when when it starts to get really hard and and it seems like we're not going to be able to pay the bills and and just doesn't seem like everything's going right we start to wonder where did I mess up where did everything go wrong I I I think that if I was out there in the wilderness and I'd seen God Time After Time After Time deliver me Time After Time After Time God meet my need I would have said you know what if we're thirsty I'm going to start looking for rain if I'm hungry I'm going to start looking for Mana if you have a need I say why don't you just start looking for the blessing why don't you start looking for your deliverance why don't you start looking for the manifestation of the promise I wonder if you're really in expectation for the manifestation of the word that God has spoken you know the most powerful word has been spoken over the bride of Christ that in the hour that you're living in in the most wicked age that you are going to be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye that your womb is already been sealed by the word of God that you can't even be impregnated by the things of this world we sound like we're lunatics but you are the very one that is going to manifest the fullness of this word hey I believe it amen the doctor doesn't have the final say you know the doctor told me I had cancer okay but God said I'm Healed that's right I have a choice sure we recognize we battle we recognize we might have sickness but that is not our the the doctor doesn't have the final say that's right amen we're not interested in public opinions we're not interested in man ideas sure doctors do what they can do they do all they can do but the doctor doesn't have the final say when the doctors go so far that's where God steps in that's what we believe and that's where we stand faith is not based on anything else but the word of God faith is not based on past failures faith is not based for what you produced in the flesh faith is based on the word and faith comes by hearing the word it's about time we start believing in who we really are amen that's right amen we have a choice and it's just not on Wednesday night and it's just not on Sunday morning we have a choice every single day of our life that this word would come into manifestation in our lives could you imagine if we had the same expectation my you know sometimes we come into a meeting we get all pumped up and we get all washed and cleaned out and we feel so good and and so revived and so refreshed and we're on fire for God and we're going back and we're actually talking amongst the Young people say oh my wouldn't got so good and then it's just maybe a little time one week two weeks three weeks and all of a sudden we're back right to the regular routine and we're starting to uh uh entertain the same things that we come out of and all of a sudden we come back from the mountain top and we're back in the valley that's the time to go fighting but we get on cruise control man I feel good I'm all washed up now I guess I can go relax no we want to go into Monday into battle Tuesday into battle seeking that which is lost praying for those that are sick say Lord uh speak to me Lead Me Guide Me Lord I want to see your word and action in my life in my family in my school in my relationships in my marriage on my job Lord oh God let me be that surrendered vessel that your life that the quickening power can come down into Lord that your Dynamics can come into the mechanics oh I believe the message I believe the words that's the mechanics but oh God I need the Dynamics of the message I need the quickening power of almighty God to drop down and Quicken the seed Quicken the word that I can be your hands [Music] extended not just some Fairy Tail not just between these four walls but each one of you come on that's right Christ the word manifested in your body amen yes right amen oh but you feel like you got so much going on you know Abraham certainly would have had a lot to point to saying look I'm old I have no ability but you gave me a promise but I love the Scripture it says Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God there's a key there strong in faith giving glory to God sounds like Abraham had a little stimulation of Revelation strong in faith giv glory to God now think about it now he's received a promise he has no ability to bring it to pass and here he's going around acting like he's going to have a baby talking like he's going to have a baby now think about it here's grandma and grandpa walking around bless God glory to God we're going to have a baby go ahead and get the baby clothes go ahead and get the carriage go ahead and get everything lined up we're going to have a baby imagine the critics imagine the scoffers Imagine everybody looking imagine the doctors looking at Abraham say Abraham what's the matter with you you you you're well stricken in age oh but Abraham had something Abraham had a revelation because faith is a revelation that's right Abraham knew he was going to have that child why because God said he was going to have that child so he started acting like he was going to have a baby he started talking like he was going to have a baby well I wonder if we've really caught a revelation that we're going in a Rapture that we're really going to go in a body change that these signs shall follow them that believe I I wonder if we get a little stimulation of revelation we might just start talking like it we might just start acting like it we might just start proclaiming it we might just start speaking it and yes the whole world's going to look like you and say you sound really funny you sound really funny talking about that yeah maybe I do may maybe I sound really funny the scripture says if you say to this mountain speak the word if you say to this mountain then I'm going to start speaking the mountains I might sound really funny you know I tell you what they really sounded funny on the day of Pentecost they sounded so funny that when they busted out them doors into the streets all the town looked at them said you know these guys are drunk men they sound they're talking funny they're sounding funny they're acting funny but Peter had to say no no we are not drunk as you suppose this is that which was promised by the prophet of Joy I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh right brother I want to be like Abraham Lord I stagger not at the promises through unbelief but Lord I'm going to give you glory amen I'm going to give you praise in the midst of the trial in the midst of the storm when everything seems like it's going wrong Lord I'm going to give you praise you might sound funny Lord thank you you said in your word that the trial the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to me you let that sink into your heart you start talking like it you start acting like it Lord I know you'll see me through Lord your grace is sufficient Lord by your stripes I'm Healed Lord you've given me the promise so Lord I'm going to give you praise I it's a really a bad day today I'm really struggling Lord but you're my savior You're My Redeemer Lord I give you all the praise thank you for your great love where in if you love me Lord uh you're so gracious you're so merciful thank you for salvation Lord thank you for this message so I'm going to give you praise Lord I'm going to give you glory I'm going to give you adoration because there you have something that this world could never have it's faith in a promise and no matter what comes your way the devil can never rob you from that it's anchored oh yes and even when you want to give up even when you want to go you know what I something es something's holding you something's keeping you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go un my father we've heard these things where the Prophet would say so when a spirit bore a Spirit-filled man in faith takes the word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that's the same as deity speaking Every Mountain must go Satan cannot stand before that man do we shrink back from that we have to take these words into our heart and we must declare we must declare yeah we're going through some hard times we're going through some hard trials we have some loved ones and we have some family and certain ones that are suffering and we're praying and we're believing this ain't the hour to back up church this ain't the hour to shrink back this ain't the hour to wonder and doubt this is the hour to Proclaim more than ever before my God Is A Healer my God is a deliverer my God is a savior my God will do what he said he would do my God will perform the promise that he has given to me Faith declares it I won't stagger I won't back up I won't sit down I'll keep preaching it I'll keep proclaiming came in it over and over again why because I have received a [Applause] promise we're blessed Prophet said when Israel was on its March and come to the land of Moab there was a gate and they said we will not let you pass through and they brought out their Prophet to curse the people instead of cursing he blessed they tried to show him all the bad things that this people had done but God showed him the good things about it oh let that settle into your heart for he seen that smitten Rock and that brass serpent going before him making an atonement for them instead of cursing he blessed the seed and they put possessed the land because they were on their Road keeping a promise of Jehovah nothing could stop them for they were Abraham's seed with a promise that they possess the Gate of the enemy and they took it all I'm letting that promise of God settle in My Heart Lord nothing can stop me nothing can stop your word because it's not me it's you and me greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and you are on your way home marching to Zion with a promise and Satan's trying to come into your way and trying to cast a stumbling block and say you're cursed and you're sick and you'll never make it I'm going to point to your failures I'm going to point to your past and Devil's constantly trying to make you look this way and look that way and Look Any Which Way But accept at the promise but if you'll just keep a single eye on his word and say Lord you promis you said Lord you gave me my family you gave me my son you gave me my daughters you gave me the Holy Ghost you you gave me Deliverance you gave me healing you gave me salvation Lord you have given me everything that I have need of and I am on my way home I am going to Zion and I'm just going to praise you I'm going to worship you I'm going to give you glory if the Devil comes and tries to curse me I'm say shut up Old Devil shut your mouth you go sit down in the corner my God is real my God Is A Healer my God is a deliverer I'm going to praise him I'm going to give him glory because he's more than any more than life to me why he's the same yesterday today and forever why don't you just start praising him on your way to Zion because you have a promise you have a promise you're God the deliverer he's the Healer he gives you your family don't stagger it's the time to give him praise my Bible says Abraham gave him glory I'm going to praise him in the tribe I'm going to praise him in the storm because I have a promise I'm on my way home with a promise God give me my family he give me my kids he give me my [Music] health well brother Matthew you're sick I don't care God gave me my health you sound really funny Matthew you're sicker than you ever been I don't care that's right God gave me a promise I'm on my home to uh to Glory I have a choice Hallelujah I'm not interested in the devil's opinion I'm not interested in the naysayers I'm not interested in the critics critics just want to criticize you want to do something good out of your heart and they're they're trying to fact check you trying to criticize you and ain't even doing anything for the kingdom of God at least I'm trying at least I'm trying to pray for the sick at least I'm trying to preach the gospel at least I'm trying to speak words of a at least I'm trying to do something to give my Lord Glory what do you do just sitting around criticizing everybody I'm a message believer and brother Ram said this and brother Ram said that he you said this and he didn't say that well what are you even [Applause] doing just trying to cause confusion just trying to get people to disagree just trying to break up the TR sound it sounds like you're Bic that's right you're just trying to cast a stumbling block before the church and say brother so and so said this and you know he shouldn't have said that can you believe that trying to ruin the confidence the people have in the man the very man that's that that's preached the word and brought forth birst after birst after birst into the king kingdom of God and people want to sit around and criticize shame on you Bao shame on you balum trying to cast the stumbling block in the way of the election of God I don't get out of my way devil I got a promise and I'm on my way to Glory I'm going to take everybody I can with me I ain't leaving a huff behind I'm taking my kids I'm taking my family I'm taking my brothers I'm taking my sisters I'm going to lay hands on the sick these signs are going to follow them that believe I am going to make manest everything that has been spoken by Malachi 45 because I've been elected to do it I won't stop short because greater is he that is in [Applause] you it's about time we realize the devil ain't picking on you oh my I remember one time when I was a kid I was out in the apartments and some big kid he wanted to play a little trick on me he lived on the Second Story and there's a little circle made out of a rope you know about 3 feet round he said oh you're supposed to stand in the circle I stood in the circle he pulled that thing dragged me right down the stairs he was bigger than me but I got to thinking I got a bigger brother so I went and got my brother and my brother he was bigger than me but he wasn't bigger than him but I was his little brother that's right come on and he didn't care if that guy was bigger than him he picked on his little brother and he fought for me and we teamed up on him well come on if the devil's picking on you say wait a second here devil you ain't you you picking on me I got a bigger brother I got the firstborn among many brother his name is the Lord Jesus and my big brother is the one that defeated you on Calvary my Big Brother's the one that ascended down into your house and took your own keys to your own house and slammed the door on you I got my big brother are here tonight to do battle for me so if you pick on me you're picking on him and we're going to gang up on you I'm going to gang up on that Devil he's trying to make you sick he's trying to make you defeated it's about time the children of God te up on the devil say boo devil get out of here get out of my life get out of my mind get out of my church I'm ready for the power of God to sweep down into the building to save all of those that are lost to heal all of those that are sick I will proclaim the word of the God hallelujah he's more than Able by time we make a choice oh now I I already see it the devil's like we done messed up tonight not again yep again you dumb devil right you done messed up again you pick on a son and a daughter of God and we got a big brother his name is Jesus Christ and I got good news he's in the [Applause] building thank you Lord that might be a news flash to somebody Jesus Christ is here why don't you open up your heart and let them in why don't you start talking to him it's not enough just to acknowledge it what about your need what about your family blind bmus could have just said oh oh that's what all the noise is about but he said wait wait a second that's who come on who's passing by oh son of David oh yes sir if you're really here Lord would you pass by my way I'm going through a hard time I'm going through a time you know Satan's very crafty you know Paul said my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man wisdom but it was in demonstration oh yes of spirit and power Prophet said if if Satan can't curse you curse you he'll try to organize you and he said so balum got Israel to commit fornication he said did you know that physical fornication is the very same spirit that lies in organized religion now let God deal with your heart because this doesn't have to be some way off out there we're talking about natural typing spiritual because this bride will manifest everything that's been spoken of her it's not a challenge it's a prophecy prophecies don't waver prophecies aren't a what if prophecies are sure but sometimes these promises that lay in the word we feel like they're at arms length because sometimes we have a choice to make sometimes there's steps we have to make because he says if he can't curse you he's going to organize you think about that sometimes we get into to our routine sometimes we get comfortable in within the framework of our church sometimes we get comfortable in our our life to where we just kind of are getting by but you are not called to tolerate sin that's right you know it makes me think of story i i i i comes to me anybody ever had a a fire alarm in your house a little smoke detector start to beep that is irritating but you know it's really something's funny about it if you just kind of allow it and you put up with it for a little bit and you put up with some more you you start to not really notice it anymore that's right you start to tolerate it you know they say confession is good for the soul so I'm going to confess you know I'm going to make an excuse for myself and you forgive me cuz I'm wrong but I in the work that I I've done once again I'm I'm just making an excuse so don't don't buy it in the work that I do I get in and out of my car all the time and uh brother Tim if you can imagine it's hard for me to remember to buckle my seat belt well you know there's a warning in your car that goes ding ding ding ding well I've tolerated that thing so long I've been on the phone talking to somebody and the person on the other end of the phone say will you please put your seat Bel on and I'm like I can't even hear it you know we do that with sin with little besetting sins and little things that we entertain we just kind of tolerate it well that's just kind of the way it is and you just tolerate it and all of a sudden we allow things into our life into our relationships into our marriage into our works space and we wonder why we get to where we are it's because the little things that we're tolerating but you're not called to tolerate sin you're called to put sin under your feet remember brother random said it's it's unconfessed sin of you Believers that will cause the church to bitterly fail not not unconfessed sin of you Sinners oh that's a key not unconfessed sin of you make Believers no the unconfessed sin of you Believers will cause this church to bitterly fail and I want to just encourage you I'm not trying to discourage you but I I'm trying to encourage you in the Lord that that we can't just go in sin in our private lives and think that it does not affect the body that is exactly what aen thought yeah he thought you know I'm just on my own I'm going to partake of this for myself and it caused the whole church to bitterly fail so we have a responsibility we have something that we have to do because you the prophet of God said and is your life worthy of the Gospel he said we've got to follow every day every hour of the day every step of the way we've got to be led by the Lord Jesus Christ if we don't we take it an organizational life think of this this smoked me when I read this and a life that doesn't follow Christ daily isn't worthy I said God forgive me for taking on an organizational life are y'all hearing with the prophet saying we've got to follow every day every hour of the day every step of the way we've got to be led by the Lord Jesus Christ if we don't we take an organizational life and a life that doesn't follow Christ daily is not worthy you are called to be more than just a churchgoer you're called to have dominion are right when Jesus came into the water he said to joh John he said suffer it to be so John John's like me me baptize you yes John suffer it to be be so because it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness there's been a prophetic word that has been spoken and we must fulfill that which has been spoken John it becometh us to fulfill all righteous don't you know bride that it becometh us to fulfill all righteous everything that has been spoken to you it becometh us to fulfill all the words that have been spoken of the Bride in the last day she is him yes you it becometh us to fulfill all the words that have been spoken amen look Malachi 4:5 has come to restore us back and I say back all the way to the beginning but even restore back the faith of the original Pentecostal fathers where there at the gate beautiful they were walking by Silver and Gold Have I None but such as which I have I give to you you got to have something to be able to give we need the quickening power yes sir the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life Lord I thank you for the word I thank you for the mechanics but Lord God I need the Dynamics to come and make that word live Malachi 4 has come to restore us back to the beginning if you say to this mountain if you say little Gods Messiahs we're being restored all the way back to the beginning where you have dominion where you can speak the word the prophet of God said now the world is groaning and nature is groan crying everything's moving what for the manifestation of the sons of God when true Sons I'm reading real familiar quotes because I I I'm I'm reading them slowly because I really want these to settle into your heart for the manifestation of sons of God when true Sons born Sons filled Sons speak their word in it is back I'm in expectation and believing I'm not looking for something to come for this we've received everything that we have need of to produce the full of the word right now right now if we can all come into one mind and one Accord if we can all plead the blood of Jesus Christ if we can all uh confess of our sins if we can all start believing together and say you know what brother Matthew you're right I I've been I've kind of been living on the line I've been living on the and you said that our unconfessed sins can cause the church to bitterly fail you know there ought to be something in your heart that wants to repent say Lord I forgive forgive me for hindering the move of the Holy Spirit Come on did he did the prophet mean what he said then I say it's time Church let's get everything under the blood let's get our lives right let's get our marriages right let's get our families right let let's apply the token let's stop going through cycles of just repeating besetting over and over and I'm moving towards something by God's grace we'll pull this all together prophetess God said he's able to achieve to himself a bride he's going to do it in the last days be able to get a bride that with the ministry exactly like his like a man and his wife become one and when Jehovah gets his people like him then he lives in his people they are one it fulfills the scripture exactly like he said in St John 14 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also now don't worry by God's grace we'll pull this all together you might wonder where how all of our thoughts going to come in here but we're called to be Overcomers sure we're going to have test we're going to have trials we're going to battle sickness the prophet said the Rapture and this is in the Rapture message he said the Rapture which is coming to pass and anything that God has in the line of his word there's always something to come out to upset that if they can it's Satan's purpose to do that it's Satan's purpose to try to break up the church it's Satan's purpose to try to cause division in the family it's Satan's purpose to try to cause conflict that's that's what his whole goal is is I is to disrupt the very plan of God and to get you to start to doubt who you are and to wonder why all of these things are happening in your life and then we come many of us come back to the place and say you know brother Matthew but I've tried I I i' I I believe all these things I believe what the prophet said but but I don't see any of the manifestation in my life I just can't ever get the victory why why do I always revert right back to the same things over and over brother and it seems like I can never get total Victory well let's just remind you that it's because of sinful flesh that you were born in a fallen nature we'll just deal with something really simple here you have a fallen nature you come into this world in a fallen nature living under a curse you know that we've been living under the curse because of sin the scripture would say because of one man's Disobedience We Are All Made Sinners Romans 3:23 would say for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God am when you come into this world you're born in sin you didn't even come with a Fighting Chance well I feel better already yeah maybe the reason why you feel like you've been getting whooped is cu you didn't have a Fighting Chance in the first place you were born in sin shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking lies within your own Spirit the desire of sin a lover of sin because you were born in sin you didn't have a chance but down inside of you somewhere here you come oh hallelujah amen there was something in there that begin to draw my Bible tells me no man can come unto the father unless he draws him that's right okay I want you to focus on one thing may maybe you've been going through a a cycle maybe you feel like you've been getting beat up but something inside of you believes the word something inside say brother Matthew I've tried over and over and over I keep falling I keep failing I I keep giving into the Same Spirit of lust I keep giving into these same things I feel like I can never get the victory but I want to ask you one question is there something in there that wants to be delivered is there something in there that want to manifest the word is there something in there what is that it's God drawing you don't you see that's the very blessing of God upon your life that he's drawing you yes you were born in a sin nature but regardless of your natural birth God has placed an ability in you a predestinated seed that within that curse there's something in you that's drawing you that God wants to bless you Prophet said when I was born a Charles and El branam in there nature I was a sinner I came to the world liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there too was another nature present predestinated was in there by God in this same body two Natures my think of Jacob Jacob was a Shyer he was a coward brother Brenham I think we'd call him lazy a mama's boy a but regardless of how bad Jacob was yes the Bible says Jacob ha I loved and Esau have I hated for the children not yet being bored neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth oh there's the difference God's calling you amen you've been given a promise God's drawing you God is calling you look all of hell is determined to keep you from recognizing who you are he's like Bayo wanting to cast a stumbling block he's wanting to point to all your F faults and all your failures he's trying to hold you under bondage under your first birth and point all your mistakes and all your failures and all your weaknesses and all your struggles and he's trying to hold you a prisoner to your past let god deal with you right now you feel like you've been living under a curse but God is coming to tell you I'm drawing you I'm dealing with your heart you might have been going through a hard time you might have been going through a trial you've been battling sickness for many years but I've come to turn the curse into a blessing why because I love you yeah the devil hates you but God loves you the devil voted against you God voted for you I tell you what which way you going to cast your boat tonight yes Israel had her back caral Parts they had their side that wasn't praiseworthy I don't know about y'all stick around a little while you might find a part that's not praiseworthy but in spite of their imperfection by the purpose of God that works through election by grace and not by works they had the cloud by day and the pillar of Fire by night they had to Smit and rock the Brazen Serpent and signs and wonders they were Vindicated not in themselves but in God and every time Balo and every time balum tried to curse the the children of Israel God blessed them every time he wanted to go out there and say oh uh these people look at their faults look at their failures they've come up for prayer time and time again and they've gone right back into the same bondage and you feel like you can never get the victory Satan's just trying to curse you he's trying to curse you in your mind he's trying to tell you you'll never get complete and total Victory he's trying to tell you that you can never make a total surrender but every time the devil tried to curse him God said I'm going to bless them glory to God every time the devil tries to curse you I say you might as well just start looking for the blessing if I'm going through a hard time I'm looking for my blessing if I'm sick I'm looking for my blessing if the devil's attacking my family I'm looking for the blessing if the devil's trying to curse you Church you might as well start looking around and say God is going to bless me if you're thirsty look for rain if you're if you're hungry look for Mana if you're sick look for healing if your children are lost look for them to be found if you want the Holy Ghost let them pour it out on you come on look for the blessing Jesus Christ is here to bless you start looking for it start acting like it start talking like it start believing and start speaking to the mountain we'll just call for the musicians come on Amen look I know the way God dealt with my heart somebody here has been going through a hard time Hallelujah Devil's been cursing you trying to throw rocks at you trying to tell you you're never going to make it you're never going to be healed this is just the way it's going to be trying to get you to point at the symptoms trying to trying to point at the doctor's report Hallelujah yeah well what about it that's right if I'm going through a test and if I'm going through a trial it's the greatest thing that ever happened to me Lord Jesus you must have saw fit in your Infinite Wisdom that I must bear this burden but oh God you would never give me more than I could bear so Lord I ask by your power and your grace you come by your Holy Ghost Lord lift up my hands and lift up my voice Lord give me strength because I'm going to glorify you if I can't open my mouth I'll lift my hand if I can't lift my hand I'll shrug my shoulder if I can't move my leg I'll wiggle my foot if I can't wiggle my foot I'm going to wiggle my toe but I'm going to do something for God because my God is worthy of praise and he has come to turn the curse into a blessing I might have been born in sin I might have been shaped in iniquity I might have been lost but now I am found he is turning the curse into a blessing why don't you praise him Abraham staggered not at the promise of God but was strong in faith giving glory to God why don't you give him glory why don't you just praise His Wonderful Name he's worthy of it nevertheless the Lord God would not hearken unto ba but the Lord thy God turned the curse thank you Lord into a blessing unto the because the Lord thy God loved Thee thank you for Ling Praise You Jesus what about your condition thank you for your your struggle maybe you feel worthless you feel like giving up Jesus is here to tell you that your condition is not your identification your identification is the word think of that woman at the wh she was stuck there was no Redemption for her condition married five times you know what's you know what's strange she was a Believer sure she was she believed there was coming a messiah oh yes yes she sure made a mess of things she made a lot of bad decisions here she she's believing for the Messiah but she's an outcast she can't go to the regular Bible studies you know she can't go to the lunch nobody wants to hang out with her cuz her life's been marked she wants to be normal Glory GL she feels all alone feels like sat dropped her her virtue nobody wants her there she is sitting out at a well one day living under a curse of mistakes and failures and somebody comes by and says woman give me a drink I believe that same Jesus is here tonight saying will you give me a [Music] drink look what God did he started to commune with her and discern her thoughts and intents of her heart and tell her her condition took a woman that was hopeless and living under a curse and she was able to take that very curse and condition and turn it into a blessing where she was so overwhelmed with joy that she had met the Messiah once was a reproach she was able to run back into the City and say come see a man who's told me all the things that I've done is this not the Messiah that same Jesus is here to do that for you to take your condition and your trial and take what you're battling and start to turn what you feel like your greatest trial and your greatest test into a blessing for the glory of God with every head bowed maybe there's somebody here that you just want to say Lord I need you to come by my way I I need a supernatural touch I I need you to change my situation For Your Glory God bless you many hands are up Lord Jesus thank you for your love it's unwavering it's unmeasured it's insurmountable it's more than sufficient it conquers all Lord we have a lot of needs represented here but you're the god that meets

Healer and that sickness can't stay those that are in bondage will be set free we shall have our Liberty Lord because you have given it to your bride Lord I pray for all the hands that have been lifted up Lord may you just move upon their heart right now in a supernatural way that their faith would reach out and claim what they have need of we just look to you right now and ask that you just
