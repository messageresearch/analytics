[0:26] when you need it.
[0:30] cuz

[0:42] it. And I'm feeling like I'm needing it
[0:47] right
[0:49] now. Oh, the Lord is my
[0:53] shepherd. I shall not want. He leads me
[0:57] by still waters till my fears are gone.
[1:02] Though I walk through the valley of the
[1:06] shadow of death. Oh, I know you are with
[1:11] me. My father, my friend, your goodness
[1:17] and mercy will follow me all of my days.

[2:15] shadow of death. Oh, I know you are with
[2:20] me. My father, my friend, your goodness
[2:25] and mercy will follow me all of my
[2:31] days. I know by your still waters I'm
[2:38] [Music]

[2:42] waters any valley I can find. I'm laying
[2:48] fear down here at heaven's
[2:51] riverside. Your word has made true in
[2:55] every season of my
[2:59] life. I believe. Yes, I
[3:03] believe. Still waters run through any
[3:08] valley I can find. I'm laying fear down.
