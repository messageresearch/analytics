[0:01] you know the other day i made mention of
[0:03] sister lana
[0:04] she just had a clear scan um
[0:08] just a few days ago a few weeks ago now
[0:11] and the kin remains cancer free
[0:14] and we thank god for that and man that
[0:17] she had a great moment of victory
[0:19] um in the service of february the 18th
[0:22] 2018
[0:24] where i was preaching on the revealing
[0:26] of sons
[0:27] and that's now been nearly two and a
[0:30] half years ago
[0:32] and god is still on the throne
[0:35] still manifests in his great glory and
[0:38] that same
[0:39] service we had a brother john
[0:42] christophel
[0:43] from uh south africa that contacted me
[0:47] about his wife's condition
[0:49] of stage three rectal cancer and
[0:52] he being in south africa there he had
[0:54] been able unable to get a job
[0:56] and he was in a very bad financial
[0:58] condition
[1:00] a young young minister and his wife and
[1:02] they were
[1:03] struggling and struggling with the um
[1:07] the the medical bills and so on and
[1:10] and um you know we we at that time were
[1:14] certainly uh preaching a lot of
[1:17] different things
[1:18] along the realm of faith and believing
[1:21] for our sister lana
[1:22] and just encouraged her and encouraged
[1:25] the people
[1:26] and encourage us to believe god for his
[1:29] words and his promises
[1:31] and um to see god come on the scene and
[1:34] to see um the lord heal sister lana with
[1:37] that
[1:38] fourth stage uh hodgkin's lymphoma
[1:41] and god healed her and delivered her
[1:43] just instantly completely
[1:46] and um you know where that she went back
[1:49] the next
[1:50] day on the i think it was the 19th on a
[1:53] monday or tuesday at least
[1:55] just that week and had a scan and
[1:57] doctors didn't know what to say about it
[2:00] and there it is right there where the
[2:02] cancer is in the lung and there it is
[2:04] the next scan
[2:05] and there's there is absolutely no
[2:08] cancer
[2:09] and this is still the testimony today
[2:12] two and a half years later
[2:14] amen we thank god for that
[2:16] [Applause]
[2:21] this um very same time that this was
[2:24] going on this brother from
[2:26] south africa i've never met him but you
[2:29] know there's just sometimes it's
[2:31] things just grip your heart and he told
[2:34] me about his situation and
[2:36] and um and so he
[2:40] i told him i would send him a prayer
[2:42] cloth because
[2:43] we believed according to the book of
[2:46] acts that they took
[2:48] handkerchiefs from the body or aprons
[2:50] from the body of saint paul
[2:52] and laid them upon the sick and they
[2:54] were healed
[2:55] now of course we're not saint paul but
[2:59] he's still the same jesus amen
[3:03] and his word is still the truth so we
[3:05] sent
[3:06] out in the i prayed over that in the
[3:08] post and
[3:09] and uh this same week of sister
[3:12] atlanta's scan
[3:13] i received a um an unsolicited
[3:16] email uh with from brother john
[3:19] uh giving me um photos of his wife and
[3:23] his testimony and um i wanted to just
[3:27] go back into that service just a moment
[3:30] where that we prayed for her and i i
[3:33] want to
[3:33] i'm doing this for a reason i'm doing
[3:36] this for a reason because i i think we
[3:38] must
[3:39] come with very great sincerity in
[3:42] every service expecting god to move
[3:46] and when we pray if it's even somebody
[3:48] from overseas somewhere
[3:50] over in south africa we never heard of
[3:52] we've never seen
[3:54] it doesn't matter they're our brother
[3:55] and sister in christ and we're going to
[3:58] pray with fervency and believe god for
[4:01] them
[4:01] amen so michael if you will take us back
[4:04] into that service just for a moment just
[4:06] for this clip
[4:07] where we prayed for brother john
[4:09] christopher and his wife

[4:14] that you call on the name of the lord

[5:01] going to torment the devil
[5:03] until we leave from here we're not going
[5:06] to give him any peace
