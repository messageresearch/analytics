[18:18] today to
[18:20] see the things we see to see that he
[18:22] walks among us
[18:26] just looking at that first verse and
[18:27] we're going to sing it again before we
[18:29] go to prayer
[18:31] he said he walks among us and all that
[18:33] he does all of his mercy and all of his
[18:35] love
[18:36] if the pen of the writer could write
[18:38] every day
[18:39] even the world can never contain it's
[18:42] what john would say in john chapter 21
[18:46] said this is this is the disciple was
[18:48] testify of these things and wrote these
[18:50] things
[18:51] and we know that his testimony is true
[18:55] and there are many other things which
[18:56] jesus did the which
[18:59] if they should be written every one i
[19:01] suppose that even the world itself
[19:04] could not contain the books that should
[19:07] be written
[19:08] that's who's walking among us he's a god
[19:12] of miracles he's a god of mercy he's the
[19:14] god
[19:15] the same yesterday today and forever i i
[19:18] tell you this morning i believe that
[19:20] this is not a
[19:22] sermon or a service to just take for
[19:24] granted
[19:25] or to just take half-heartedly i believe
[19:28] we're in for a special moment with him
[19:31] i just woke up this morning just feeling
[19:33] the charge of
[19:35] the presence of god i know the angel of
[19:38] the lord is among us
[19:42] yesterday i would walk around my
[19:45] mother's bed and we would pray
[19:48] just a few days before brother ron
[19:50] spencer had been there
[19:54] and was praying for her
[19:58] he would come to me and said go around
[20:00] to the
[20:01] head of that bed and see if that angel
[20:03] is not there and i would go around there
[20:07] and i would feel the presence of god and
[20:10] i knew the angel of the lord was
[20:11] standing there
[20:15] and he would my brother tim would walk
[20:19] back in
[20:20] and he would tell him what was going on
[20:22] and
[20:23] brother tim's words was thank you for
[20:25] coming
[20:27] thank you for coming so we can't we
[20:30] can't open the red sea but we can speak
[20:32] and we can go forward
[20:34] [Music]
[20:38] as they would turn around and leave
[20:41] and go out the door as we was about to
[20:43] leave the hospital room
[20:46] the presence of the angel would walk
[20:48] around would go out
[20:50] or go around the bed and it would touch
[20:52] esther she stood right there
[20:53] at the foot of the bed and she would
[20:56] just about crumble to her feet and lose
[20:58] her strength the virtue would leave her
[21:01] and she would begin to speak
[21:06] said this is the miracle of life
[21:10] yesterday we would go there again and i
[21:13] would you know walk around there to that
[21:14] part of the bed
[21:16] just to see if that one same place would
[21:18] be there that same moment would
[21:20] wouldn't feel anything but i would went
[21:24] out because i wanted
[21:25] brother my son andrew to come in and so
[21:27] i went in there to sign him in got to
[21:30] talking to the
[21:31] receptionist for a moment and talking to
[21:33] her about the things of god and
[21:35] different situations
[21:37] by the time i got into the room they had
[21:38] went back into prayer and brother matt
[21:40] dexter that is here with us somewhere in
[21:43] the building this morning
[21:44] and right there he i'd walk in as he was
[21:47] praying
[21:48] and the presence of the lord would just
[21:50] you could tell the atmosphere had
[21:52] changed in the room
[21:54] the presence of god would come into the
[21:56] room and
[21:58] just knew that the lord was there again
[22:02] and uh we the nurses would walk in
[22:05] after they'd we'd finish praying and she
[22:08] would ask her was it time to turn her
[22:10] turn mom over and
[22:12] she said yeah she said i actually was
[22:14] coming in a few moments ago but it
[22:15] sounded like he was praying so
[22:17] i wanted to give you some time and so
[22:19] they came in to do that we would walk
[22:21] out and
[22:22] brother derek paris was with us and
[22:24] different ones and
[22:26] we'd walk out and brother tim would text
[22:28] me and say it's
[22:29] all clear come back in let's have prayer
[22:31] because visitation was about to be over
[22:35] and let's have one last prayer before we
[22:37] leave
[22:39] so we'd walk back in and i'd walk around
[22:41] that end of the bed around to the side
[22:43] right to the head
[22:45] the presence of god was so strong
[22:48] that i would just i would have to grab
[22:50] even as i am right now having to hold
[22:53] the bed to stand up and i would look at
[22:57] dad and i said the presence of the angel
[22:59] is here again
[23:00] and he'll begin to say thank you for
[23:02] coming
[23:04] because when he comes something always
[23:05] good happens
[23:08] and so i know this morning he's with us
[23:11] i would i would pick a sermon on my way
[23:14] home our way to church this morning and
[23:16] just randomly choose one and
[23:18] it had i say randomly in a way it was
[23:20] random because
[23:22] i had no idea what would be said but it
[23:24] was jesus christ the same yesterday
[23:26] today and forever and as you know
[23:28] i've been on that thought and so i would
[23:31] thought well this would be going to
[23:32] listen to and hit play and brother
[23:34] branham would again say
[23:36] it's my favorite of the hymns down from
[23:40] his glory
[23:41] he said because it expresses his deity
[23:43] in the day that we're living in
[23:45] he said they want to make him just a
[23:47] prophet but he's more than a prophet
[23:49] he's god
[23:52] so i know we're in for something special
[23:54] this morning
[23:56] so i wouldn't take this moment very
[23:57] lightly i would take it very seriously
[24:00] he walks among us if you know who's
[24:02] walking among you
[24:04] then you would reach out and touch the
[24:05] hem of his garment
[24:07] and be made whole this morning be
[24:09] touched
[24:10] he's a high priest that we can be
[24:12] touched by the feelings
[24:13] of our infirmity i we have a lot of
[24:16] needs this morning and i i'm going to
[24:18] sing that before we pray but
[24:19] i want to take these knees before you
[24:21] today
[24:22] we have brother raymond butler that's
[24:25] his daughter sister
[24:26] ron is asking for prayer he he streams
[24:29] nearly every service of not every
[24:31] service here and
[24:34] was very tuned into things that goes on
[24:36] here in our church but
[24:38] he said they removed a cancerous tumor
[24:41] from his colon the doctor stated that
[24:42] the cancer had seeped out into the blood
[24:45] he's to start chemo treatments tomorrow
[24:47] and desires prayers of the saints to be
[24:49] with him to carry him through the
[24:50] journey ahead
[24:52] he trusts us he says trust us in god and
[24:54] he believes him
[24:56] he knows he's the healer and he's with
[24:57] him but he appreciate all of us to
[24:59] remember him in prayer
[25:01] we had sister debbie ray from washington
[25:04] recovering from a hysterectomy to remove
[25:06] a small cancer that was found
[25:08] doing well husband is having surgery
[25:11] just needing
[25:12] a touch in their bodies uh he's having
[25:15] he's having surgery monday to remove
[25:16] cancer on his tongue
[25:19] both need healing and insurance and
[25:21] things to go through for them
[25:23] ask god to make a way where there seems
[25:25] to be no way
[25:26] you know we have the happy valley church
[25:29] that's
[25:30] been under attack of this covid
[25:34] and brother jim babb is in very serious
[25:36] condition in the hospital
[25:38] by the tim airwood as well and maybe
[25:41] some others
[25:42] but many of them are sick he's asking
[25:44] the lord to move on their behalf
[25:47] i was just listening today that the
[25:49] angel of the lord that
[25:50] and on that same tape as brother branham
[25:52] would talk about that woman there was
[25:54] two women that came in the prayer line
[25:56] and how that it was pronounced healing
[25:58] over their bodies he said
[26:00] he said it don't always happen
[26:01] immediately he said but
[26:03] god always answers and he said if you'll
[26:06] just hold the faith of god in your heart
[26:09] he said god sometimes will he said it
[26:11] just depends he said but don't ever back
[26:13] up if it don't happen immediately
[26:15] just hold on to the promise and god will
[26:17] bring it to pass and
[26:19] we know the story of how he said the
[26:20] healing angel passed to the neighborhood
[26:23] he walks among us and i believe he's
[26:26] walking through the hospital rooms this
[26:27] morning
[26:28] and then and the places where his people
[26:31] are in
[26:32] in need of him sister ladonna smith is
[26:34] as well on a ventilator and
[26:36] been fighting for a life and things are
[26:39] moving in the right direction
[26:40] even now but we want to ask god to bring
[26:42] a complete healing and
[26:44] total deliverance to her body brother
[26:46] ron ron spencer would feel led yesterday
[26:49] to have a prayer line in his church
[26:51] feel directed to preach last night and
[26:53] to have a prayer line the man stood for
[26:55] over two hours
[26:57] praying for the needs of the people
[26:58] [Music]
[27:00] what a mighty god we serve
[27:04] mercy of course we want to continue to
[27:06] remember sister karen
[27:08] and just ask the healing angel to pass
[27:10] through her place again today
[27:13] i i believe it doesn't matter what
[27:14] you're facing god is able
[27:17] more than able and able to touch any
[27:20] need and any heart
[27:22] any desire how many would have a need
[27:24] today you want to make known to him
[27:26] hallelujah let's just sing this verse
[27:29] and course again before we go to prayer
[27:31] he walks among us
[27:35] and all that he does
[27:38] all of his mercy
[27:50] even this world
[27:54] could never contain
[27:57] how i have been blessed
[28:07] he's so good to me
[28:22] [Music]
[28:28] i
[28:31] [Music]
[28:40] how many do they believe that prayer
[28:42] changes things
[28:44] i believe it was friday night we got
[28:46] word that the doctor
[28:47] said sister ladonna wouldn't make it
[28:49] through the night
[28:51] they said she wasn't gonna make it
[28:53] through the night and i know me and my
[28:55] wife got down and went to prayer as many
[28:57] of you did
[28:58] as people began to pray for around the
[29:00] world and as i got up from there
[29:02] all i could think of was brother andrew
[29:03] spencer preaching here
[29:05] o king i'll see you in the morning
[29:09] and since that moment she's been
[29:12] improving
[29:13] and like brother timothy said it's
[29:15] heading in the right direction and it's
[29:16] positive but we believe she's going to
[29:18] be completely restored and completely
[29:20] healed
[29:21] you got brother jim babb and and brother
[29:24] airwood they're
[29:25] in the hospital in serious condition it
[29:26] wasn't too long ago i was laying in icu
[29:29] but the prayer of the saints changed
[29:31] things
[29:33] and i believe if we'll bind together and
[29:35] we'll go to prayer for these as if
[29:36] they're our mom as if they're our dad
[29:38] our loved one and take them before the
[29:40] throne of grace
[29:41] you can prepare for a series of
[29:43] victories
[29:44] because the enemy has come in like a
[29:46] flood but there's a standard
[29:48] there's a standard being raised and our
[29:51] god will be victorious we will be
[29:53] victorious we will see victory and we
[29:55] will see
[29:56] healings and we will see salvation let's
[29:59] take this before our god now

[58:38] amen we have something thank you we have
[58:42] well just wait just a minute um
[58:45] so we have something here i just wanted
[58:48] to speak about this morning
[58:50] before that we go into the message
[58:54] and um uh i have a few little
[58:57] photographs i'll be showing you
[58:59] just in a moment but um you know the
[59:04] we have um something that i spoke to you
[59:07] about many years ago
[59:09] and that i want to kind of bring to your
[59:11] attention today just one more time
[59:14] and um as as you know we believe
[59:18] in divine healing and there's healing no
[59:21] matter which way you go
[59:22] because the bible says he heals all
[59:25] diseases
[59:27] there's never a disease god doesn't heal
[59:31] some years ago i was looking at the
[59:34] the aspects of the holy spirit as he
[59:37] delivers
[59:39] and as you know down to the church ages
[59:41] there he is anointed
[59:44] um he has anointed um men
[59:47] and in different ages different times
[59:51] uh with a portion of his spirit and it's
[59:54] reflected in the four living creatures
[59:57] and that is the lion the ox the man and
[1:00:00] the eagle
[1:00:02] and uh of course when the white horse
[1:00:04] rider went forth
[1:00:06] which was it was like christ but it was
[1:00:09] the antichrist a deceiving spirit
[1:00:11] god raised up um and turned the face of
[1:00:14] the
[1:00:15] of the living creature toward the church
[1:00:18] and they had great faith as a lion
[1:00:21] and they had tenacity to hold on to the
[1:00:25] promise
[1:00:26] and to call those that were that said
[1:00:28] they were apostles and were not and
[1:00:30] found them liars
[1:00:32] and called them false apostles and so
[1:00:35] they had you know men with great faith
[1:00:38] and there was great miracles and signs
[1:00:40] and wonders
[1:00:41] that followed that and was influenced by
[1:00:44] that and then of course
[1:00:45] you know it changed from the white to
[1:00:47] the red and satan comes in
[1:00:49] and he changes his form and and now he
[1:00:53] bloodies the white horse with a
[1:00:55] uh with a sword and and there are
[1:00:58] millions that are killed
[1:00:59] um as the power of state got behind the
[1:01:03] the church and it formed into the
[1:01:05] catholicism and there was 68 million
[1:01:07] that were killed
[1:01:09] during those horrible times and and um
[1:01:13] and so the the ox anointing
[1:01:17] gave them the power to overcome in that
[1:01:20] age so
[1:01:20] it wasn't a different holy spirit or a
[1:01:22] different living creature
[1:01:24] aspect of god it was the same one but he
[1:01:26] just turned
[1:01:27] another face and he looked there toward
[1:01:30] them
[1:01:30] in that time and they willingly
[1:01:34] gave their lives and sometimes you
[1:01:37] wonder how
[1:01:38] in the world could men and women give
[1:01:41] their lives
[1:01:42] like they did and even their children
[1:01:44] would die
[1:01:45] and and their wife or husband would be
[1:01:49] killed and all of these things it was
[1:01:51] you know a horrible time how could they
[1:01:53] do it
[1:01:54] well because they were anointed to do so
[1:01:58] and they had the calf anointing there
[1:02:01] which was a sacrificial animal and
[1:02:03] they willingly gave their life and then
[1:02:06] of course the
[1:02:07] the way the enemy attacked it changed
[1:02:10] and he comes as the black horse rider
[1:02:12] and
[1:02:13] begins to begins to bring
[1:02:16] again charging money for the staff of
[1:02:19] life
[1:02:20] and and it started the dark ages and
[1:02:22] there would be a horrible
[1:02:24] time where truth was sequestered and
[1:02:28] and uh you know it um was a time of
[1:02:31] great darkness where um the light of
[1:02:34] god's
[1:02:35] word was dimmed and and that god gave
[1:02:39] them
[1:02:39] the again turned it as the enemy came he
[1:02:44] turned it a different way and another
[1:02:46] face looked toward
[1:02:47] the church and it was the
[1:02:50] man and with the man anointing it was
[1:02:54] the intelligence of a man
[1:02:56] and god would use men like luther with a
[1:03:00] gutenberg press and they would put the
[1:03:03] bible in the
[1:03:04] hands of the common people in the
[1:03:06] language instead of latin
[1:03:08] which nobody could read had to have a
[1:03:10] priesthood for you or being hid away in
[1:03:13] the cloisters of some monastery the
[1:03:16] bible now
[1:03:17] every person could have the bible in
[1:03:20] their common language they would print
[1:03:22] it in the
[1:03:22] in the german language and then from
[1:03:24] there into english you know tyndale and
[1:03:26] many others would give their lives
[1:03:29] for this book that you hold don't you
[1:03:32] ever take it for granted men
[1:03:35] died gave their life
[1:03:39] so you could have it in your language
[1:03:41] and that you could read it
[1:03:43] don't neglect it amen men's blood was
[1:03:46] spilled over for that
[1:03:48] and with the intelligence of a man god
[1:03:51] gave us the bible in print and so with
[1:03:54] that it
[1:03:55] overcame the darkness of
[1:03:58] that age with the light of the glorious
[1:04:01] word of god
[1:04:02] and so then of course you know
[1:04:05] the last anointing there would be when
[1:04:08] we come to the laodicean age
[1:04:10] it would be the eagle anointing and to
[1:04:13] overcome that
[1:04:14] god would send an eagle anointing he
[1:04:16] would send the prophet
[1:04:18] that he would come to to to bring us
[1:04:21] into
[1:04:22] realms where all things are possible to
[1:04:25] them that believe
[1:04:27] and so you know again the eagle is the
[1:04:30] only one that doesn't have to worry
[1:04:32] about
[1:04:33] crossing the river right he flies right
[1:04:36] over the top of it
[1:04:37] and it speaks of him as a flying eagle
[1:04:40] specifically
[1:04:41] because it indicates that we're going to
[1:04:43] have a rapture
[1:04:44] in this age so we're in a rapture now in
[1:04:48] a rapture in time
[1:04:49] under an eagle anointing right
[1:04:52] and so as i looked at that some years
[1:04:54] ago and thought about it that this is
[1:04:56] god's way of deliverance
[1:04:58] that sometimes you know in our in our
[1:05:01] troubles our trials the problems we have
[1:05:04] that god will will look upon us
[1:05:08] and the the the face of the living
[1:05:10] creature god's anointing will
[1:05:12] turn toward us as we as we pray and
[1:05:16] sometimes it'll be the great faith a
[1:05:19] lion
[1:05:19] ferocious uh tenacious
[1:05:22] courageous holding onto a promise
[1:05:26] now the these four living creatures were
[1:05:29] the same
[1:05:30] as um as the emblems of the fortre
[1:05:33] of the of the heads of the tribes of
[1:05:35] israel they would
[1:05:36] there would be four of them and three
[1:05:38] tribes on each side that would be
[1:05:40] guards around the the tabernacle and so
[1:05:44] judah would be under the lion
[1:05:45] down under the eagle and and so on like
[1:05:48] that and
[1:05:48] and with them that would be the banner
[1:05:51] and three tribes there with them as they
[1:05:53] gathered around
[1:05:54] and so this the same thing now um these
[1:05:57] are
[1:05:58] the guards there and when god his
[1:06:01] anointing comes
[1:06:02] a lot of times for us for healing it'll
[1:06:04] be the lion anointing
[1:06:07] or sometimes it will be the other side
[1:06:10] of the the opposite side which will be
[1:06:13] the eagle anointing
[1:06:14] and that's the miracle it just snatches
[1:06:17] you right out in a
[1:06:18] moment and you know one moment you're
[1:06:22] this way and the next moment you're you
[1:06:24] know it's different
[1:06:25] it's when it's like with my wife when
[1:06:28] they when
[1:06:28] and with little drew sitting at the end
[1:06:30] of the bed in one
[1:06:32] moment you know the eagle anointing
[1:06:34] there
[1:06:35] that the miraculous took place or
[1:06:37] eyesight came back little drew run all
[1:06:39] over the house
[1:06:40] never been able to walk 18 months old
[1:06:43] couldn't pull up
[1:06:44] couldn't couldn't um hardly stand alone
[1:06:47] could not take steps
[1:06:48] so you know you had you had that that
[1:06:51] eagle anointing is the
[1:06:53] miraculous and then you have times
[1:06:56] like when my wife went through the brain
[1:06:59] bleed a year ago and doctors didn't give
[1:07:01] us
[1:07:02] any hope and they called me in the
[1:07:04] middle of the night and said should we
[1:07:05] evacuate the blood from her brain and
[1:07:08] you know and and i held her life in my
[1:07:11] hands just for a moment
[1:07:12] and said yes by all means do that and
[1:07:15] the face
[1:07:16] turned around toward the intellect
[1:07:19] and god used to doctors and god uses
[1:07:23] doctors
[1:07:24] amen and and so and it looked
[1:07:28] that way and evacuated the blood and you
[1:07:30] know the story
[1:07:32] she came home she's lived now a year
[1:07:34] it's been
[1:07:35] wonderful that we have had this this
[1:07:37] time
[1:07:38] but there are there is one more and
[1:07:40] sometimes the
[1:07:42] face of the anointing which is the car
[1:07:45] for an
[1:07:46] ox anointing turns around and when you
[1:07:48] pray and
[1:07:50] and it's death but you see
[1:07:53] death doesn't change god's healing
[1:07:59] you understand he still heals all
[1:08:02] diseases
[1:08:03] in fact it's a greater healing than any
[1:08:06] because it takes you from here from
[1:08:08] suffering
[1:08:09] into a place into a dimension that is
[1:08:12] beyond
[1:08:13] you know anything that you could ever
[1:08:16] imagine that your heart could ever dream
[1:08:18] about
[1:08:19] no yesterdays or tomorrow young and
[1:08:22] as i saw my mother just young her face
[1:08:25] so tight
[1:08:25] no wrinkles a beautiful white garment
[1:08:29] there and i i thought you know who is
[1:08:32] this young girl and
[1:08:34] you know and i said it looks like my
[1:08:36] mother but
[1:08:37] who who could this be and i looked at
[1:08:39] brother ron standing there and he said
[1:08:41] wow i said brother ron that that looks
[1:08:44] just like my mother and
[1:08:45] he she spoke up and she said it is me
[1:08:48] tim
[1:08:50] and i've come to tell you you're well
[1:08:52] thought of over here
[1:08:56] and i'm sorry for all the trouble i
[1:08:58] caused you
[1:08:59] so you know um we know just
[1:09:03] one breath away is total divine healing
[1:09:07] and one day it'll be that for us even we
[1:09:10] that are living and
[1:09:11] alive and remain total divine healing
[1:09:15] now because sometimes that it
[1:09:18] you know doctors give up hope which the
[1:09:21] intelligence of man says
[1:09:23] we can't help you and you know we're
[1:09:26] we're doing everything we can to hold on
[1:09:28] with tenacity as a lion or
[1:09:31] you know our trusting for a miracle of
[1:09:34] the eagle
[1:09:35] you know but let me just say this to you
[1:09:38] as we
[1:09:38] think of this you know we we know it
[1:09:41] won't be
[1:09:42] the intelligence of a man because
[1:09:44] they've given up
[1:09:46] but brother branham said uh sometimes he
[1:09:49] said it turns dark around the people
[1:09:52] and i know they're not going to live but
[1:09:54] i don't say it
[1:09:56] because prayer could change that again
[1:10:02] and let me just say again he repeats it
[1:10:05] again
[1:10:05] the same thing a lot of times i see it
[1:10:08] turn dark
[1:10:09] under the people and i say well go on
[1:10:11] and may the lord bless you or something
[1:10:12] like that
[1:10:13] because prayer could change it
[1:10:17] so even if it looks like you know the
[1:10:20] anointing is looking this way and
[1:10:22] it looks like death is you know looks uh
[1:10:25] our direction or the ox anointing it
[1:10:27] looks our direction
[1:10:29] prayer can change it so we're standing
[1:10:33] there believing and trusting
[1:10:35] and expecting and knowing that jesus
[1:10:38] christ is the same
[1:10:39] yesterday today and forever so you might
[1:10:42] wonder so well what are you going to do
[1:10:44] is sister karen dies
[1:10:46] i'm going to keep preaching divine
[1:10:48] healing
[1:10:49] amen i'm going to still preach that
[1:10:51] jesus saves and he delivers
[1:10:53] because my jesus is the lord he heals
[1:10:55] every disease and
[1:10:57] there's even healing and death but let
[1:10:59] me tell you this
[1:11:00] she can't die she died a long time ago
[1:11:04] give me a picture of number one please
[1:11:07] and
[1:11:07] she died a long time ago
[1:11:12] and then as i told you i preached from
[1:11:14] the churches book
[1:11:16] many years ago i still have this book
[1:11:19] picture number two
[1:11:21] this is my churches book which i
[1:11:23] preached two series from
[1:11:25] to this church where that i took a 125
[1:11:30] 30 sermons sometimes preached on only a
[1:11:33] line and
[1:11:34] took this book as you can see is well
[1:11:37] worn
[1:11:38] and i studied it since i was a boy
[1:11:41] we cut our teeth on this church hates
[1:11:43] book when
[1:11:45] when we in 1965 we received our first
[1:11:49] copies at the
[1:11:50] at these threeport meetings when brother
[1:11:52] branham was there there were
[1:11:54] copies of that that were brought to the
[1:11:55] meetings and we got our first copies
[1:11:58] there or
[1:11:59] right shortly thereafter and and
[1:12:02] mother and dad got us ever won a book a
[1:12:05] church's book personally
[1:12:07] and this was my book we sat around as a
[1:12:10] family
[1:12:10] because we had no place to go we had
[1:12:13] been
[1:12:14] put out by our church who had voted to
[1:12:17] join a
[1:12:17] denomination and we were against the
[1:12:20] nomination
[1:12:21] and so we came out and and um
[1:12:25] i was only 11 years old when i got this
[1:12:27] book
[1:12:28] but anyway we got this we
[1:12:32] we we came out and we had no place to go
[1:12:35] we sat in a living room
[1:12:36] and we read this book along with our
[1:12:39] bibles
[1:12:40] paragraph by paragraph and and we read
[1:12:43] it as a
[1:12:44] family each one of us taking a paragraph
[1:12:46] and reading
[1:12:47] my youngest brother learned to read on
[1:12:50] the church age book
[1:12:51] and and so you know we helped him
[1:12:54] stumble through
[1:12:56] all the words and everything else so you
[1:12:58] know i did this
[1:13:00] but i want you to know in one of those
[1:13:02] services
[1:13:04] give me the last one on april 11
[1:13:07] 1976 the holy spirit
[1:13:10] fell in the church as i was preaching
[1:13:14] on the church's book taking it in the
[1:13:16] series
[1:13:17] and my wife karen received the baptism
[1:13:21] of the holy ghost and so you know she
[1:13:24] can't die
[1:13:26] she's eternal the devil can't take her
[1:13:29] from us
[1:13:30] a man she can only just change dwelling
[1:13:33] places

[1:15:29] of a man with his intelligence

[1:15:34] this that even if death looks at it

[1:15:40] change it
[1:15:42] that just in a moment just in a moment
[1:15:46] seem lord it was just a moment when

[1:16:49] cells in cancer patients

[1:17:39] god bless you thank you thank you
[1:17:43] amen god bless you as you know i've been
[1:17:46] using a timer and i just now started it
[1:17:52] amen first john chapter 3 verse 1.
[1:17:57] first john chapter 3 verse 1 behold
[1:18:00] what manner of love the father hath
[1:18:02] bestowed upon
[1:18:03] us that we should be called the sons of
[1:18:05] god therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:18:08] because it knew him
[1:18:09] not beloved now we are the sons of god
[1:18:13] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:18:15] be but we know that
[1:18:17] when he shall appear we shall be like
[1:18:20] him
[1:18:21] for we shall see him as he is how many
[1:18:23] believes were in the
[1:18:24] hour of disappearing i don't think this
[1:18:28] is future i think
[1:18:29] right now even even though it is future
[1:18:33] but yet at the same time is present amen
[1:18:37] first john 4 and verse 4 the scripture
[1:18:40] is so full of so many wonderful things
[1:18:42] here
[1:18:44] now you are of god little children and
[1:18:46] have overcome them because
[1:18:48] greater is he that is in you
[1:18:51] than he that is in the world amen god
[1:18:54] bless you
[1:18:54] you can be seated today i'm going to
[1:18:57] speak on the book
[1:18:58] of acts continues
[1:19:03] hallelujah timothy didn't know what i
[1:19:05] was preaching on
[1:19:06] so he brought me out on the new
[1:19:08] testament church rising up
[1:19:10] amen now as we are looking at this
[1:19:14] god has ordained a people to be
[1:19:18] a book of acts church as we remember
[1:19:22] brother branham telling us that
[1:19:25] christ in the true church is a
[1:19:27] continuation of the book of acts
[1:19:29] that's why we can call this a
[1:19:31] continuation or
[1:19:33] the book of acts continues and then he
[1:19:36] says that
[1:19:37] the book of revelation on the other hand
[1:19:39] it exposes
[1:19:41] um the antichrist spirit that would come
[1:19:44] into the church and defile it and
[1:19:46] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[1:19:49] now when we talk about the acts of the
[1:19:52] holy spirit or the acts of the apostles
[1:19:55] rather
[1:19:55] the book of acts it is not the acts
[1:19:58] of her failures that we are going to
[1:20:03] because i want to just remind you that
[1:20:06] we are a people who are predestinated
[1:20:09] not to fall now we know the early church
[1:20:13] would have to go down into the ground
[1:20:15] because they were a sea church that
[1:20:18] could have been raptured
[1:20:20] but god having something better things
[1:20:22] more names in the book to be manifested
[1:20:25] on the earth
[1:20:26] knowing that there would seven church
[1:20:28] ages follow
[1:20:29] that there will be 2 000 years of
[1:20:31] gentile dispensation
[1:20:34] that god knowing all of these things
[1:20:36] that
[1:20:37] that um he he would plant that church
[1:20:41] for a future crop where that it would
[1:20:45] come back to
[1:20:46] seed again and so again we are
[1:20:49] we're not a book of acts of her failures
[1:20:52] we are not the acts
[1:20:54] of her ignorant deeds we are not the
[1:20:57] acts of divisiveness over
[1:20:59] jewish traditions nor are we the acts of
[1:21:03] arguments over doctrine nor
[1:21:06] are we the acts of petty human rivalry
[1:21:11] now that is not the book of acts church
[1:21:14] i mean that is the book of human
[1:21:17] failures it's the acts of human
[1:21:19] failures the book of acts is called that
[1:21:22] because it is the acts of the holy
[1:21:25] spirit
[1:21:26] working in power in the church
[1:21:29] can you say amen now god has ordained
[1:21:32] a people to have a the book of acts of
[1:21:36] power
[1:21:36] and manifestations of the holy ghost
[1:21:40] as brother branham would tell us again
[1:21:42] in the church age book
[1:21:43] and if the church is the true church
[1:21:46] it will have the very same spirit and
[1:21:50] word and acts of power that they had at
[1:21:53] pentecost
[1:21:55] by experience it will be a pentecostal
[1:21:58] church
[1:21:59] and there will be tongues and
[1:22:02] interpretation
[1:22:03] and prophecy and healings and god will
[1:22:07] be in the midst of her
[1:22:08] and god will declare himself in the
[1:22:12] midst of her
[1:22:13] as he always has praise the lord
[1:22:17] again in the resume of the ages he said
[1:22:19] the people of god
[1:22:21] are being made ready by the word of god
[1:22:24] or the word of truth
[1:22:25] from the messenger to this age in her
[1:22:28] will
[1:22:28] be the fullness of pentecost
[1:22:32] for the spirit will bring the people
[1:22:35] right back
[1:22:36] to where they were at the beginning that
[1:22:39] is thus saith the lord
[1:22:43] how many believes and thus saith the
[1:22:45] lord
[1:22:46] amen now of course we know that
[1:22:50] as he told us again that the lutheran
[1:22:53] age
[1:22:53] did not restore the church it started a
[1:22:56] reformation
[1:22:58] the western age these ages beyond us
[1:23:01] are passed us there which is the
[1:23:04] methodist age with john wesley
[1:23:06] it did not restore the church the
[1:23:09] pentecostal age we're talking about
[1:23:11] azusa street now
[1:23:13] did not restore but god has to restore
[1:23:17] for he cannot deny his word this
[1:23:20] is not the resurrection of the church it
[1:23:22] is the restoration
[1:23:24] and god will bring or take the church
[1:23:27] right back to pentecost of the beginning
[1:23:31] hallelujah now i want to just bring out
[1:23:34] a few things today as we preface
[1:23:37] where i'm going today in december of
[1:23:40] 1959
[1:23:41] you know brother branham preached the
[1:23:43] holy ghost series
[1:23:45] how many has ever heard it well if you
[1:23:47] happen you know you need to hear what
[1:23:49] the
[1:23:49] spirit has said to the church but in
[1:23:52] 1959 of december he preached the holy
[1:23:55] ghost series at his church
[1:23:57] he preached on what is the holy ghost he
[1:23:59] preached what the holy ghost was given
[1:24:01] for
[1:24:02] then he had the unrecorded sermon of how
[1:24:05] uh
[1:24:06] the how to receive the holy ghost and
[1:24:08] finally he had questioned
[1:24:09] answers on the holy ghost and but in

[1:24:31] church

[1:24:38] follow the believers and so forth

[1:25:09] just willingly
[1:25:10] trying to deceive them you know what
[1:25:14] kind of man do you think he was
[1:25:16] what about his sermons when he preached
[1:25:18] the church ages
[1:25:20] and this would be now a year later in
[1:25:22] december of 1960
[1:25:24] and in the laodicean church age and how
[1:25:27] many beliefs

[1:25:31] do you reckon do you reckon the
[1:25:33] messenger

[1:25:38] this
[1:25:38] message messenger had a message from god
[1:25:42] that it was jesus christ speaking to
[1:25:45] this generation
[1:25:47] eventually you know the one jesus christ
[1:25:50] said
[1:25:51] to the angel or the angelos and the
[1:25:53] messenger
[1:25:54] of laodicea write these things
[1:25:57] god had something for this last age
[1:26:00] do you believe that so he would he would
[1:26:03] say
[1:26:04] in that message a good pedigreed heart
[1:26:06] say he's gentle
[1:26:08] oh he's good i like him he put his head
[1:26:10] on you over your shoulders
[1:26:11] loving kind why he knows who his pappy
[1:26:15] is
[1:26:15] he knows who his grandpappy is he knows
[1:26:19] who his grandpappy's pappy
[1:26:21] was and man he's he can go plumb on back
[1:26:25] his
[1:26:25] pedigree i like to see a pedigreed
[1:26:28] christian
[1:26:30] not packing his letter he's a methodist

[1:26:34] pentecostal this week and pilgrim holi
[1:26:37] is next week he don't know who his pappy
[1:26:39] is or whose mammy is

[1:26:44] of the spirit of god
[1:26:45] can take you plum back to the day of
[1:26:48] pentecost
[1:26:50] because he is a pedigreed pentecostal
[1:26:54] amen i want to be listen your prophet
[1:26:57] i want to be pentecost from the top of
[1:27:00] my head
[1:27:02] to the souls of my feet
[1:27:05] i don't mean denominational pentecost i
[1:27:07] mean the real power
[1:27:09] of the resurrected christ the real
[1:27:13] pentecostal blessing
[1:27:16] now i shouldn't have to make a
[1:27:18] disclaimer but just just so that you
[1:27:20] know
[1:27:21] make no mistake about it i am not
[1:27:24] advocating at all to go back to azusa
[1:27:26] street
[1:27:28] you cannot revive that neither are we
[1:27:31] trying to
[1:27:33] but we're talking about a restoration
[1:27:36] promise
[1:27:36] by malachi 4.
[1:27:39] amen and malachite forward brother
[1:27:42] branham tells us
[1:27:43] over and over again was to turn the
[1:27:46] hearts of the children
[1:27:47] back to the faith of the pentecostal
[1:27:51] father in the message of shame
[1:27:54] in 1965 you know in jeffersonville
[1:27:58] he will say notice today if somebody
[1:28:01] says
[1:28:02] um are you a christian oh it's a popular
[1:28:04] thing to say
[1:28:05] oh i'm a christian see but then he says
[1:28:09] but do you believe the word of god
[1:28:12] oh yeah brother tim we believe the
[1:28:14] message yes sir we got the mysteries
[1:28:16] down we got all the truths we
[1:28:18] listen to what he asked when but you
[1:28:20] believe the word of god where it said
[1:28:23] these signs shall follow
[1:28:27] them that believe oh even ministers
[1:28:30] faces
[1:28:31] will will blush see
[1:28:34] or are you ashamed to say say of divine
[1:28:37] healing
[1:28:38] are you ashamed of the full gospel are
[1:28:41] you ashamed of your pentecostal
[1:28:43] experience
[1:28:44] that 99 of message believers have never
[1:28:48] had
[1:28:49] that's being ashamed of his word
[1:28:52] that's his word made flesh in you
[1:28:56] remember he tells us invincible union
[1:28:58] that the only kind
[1:29:00] that the word can bring forth is those
[1:29:03] tongue speaking acts 238 blabbering
[1:29:05] screaming children
[1:29:07] amen now he tells us in the church age
[1:29:10] book
[1:29:10] that the true church will always try to
[1:29:13] be like the original at pentecost
[1:29:16] and if there's anything we are aiming
[1:29:19] for
[1:29:20] it is not to die
[1:29:24] it is not to die with the cycle of
[1:29:26] revival and death
[1:29:29] it is to go back to life again
[1:29:33] to break the cycle of recycling death
[1:29:36] because every age would have its revival
[1:29:39] and they would die
[1:29:40] and we see them dying everywhere but i'm
[1:29:43] going to tell you there's somebody going
[1:29:45] to be
[1:29:46] alive and redeemed at the coming of the
[1:29:48] lord
[1:29:49] there's somebody going to be an
[1:29:52] [Applause]
[1:30:04] might as well be me
[1:30:08] hallelujah the true
[1:30:11] church will always try to be like the
[1:30:13] original of pentacles
[1:30:15] that's right i want to know what is our
[1:30:17] church's aiming toward what are we
[1:30:18] trying to be like
[1:30:22] what is it our goal what is what is what
[1:30:24] is it
[1:30:25] that we're we're aiming what do we want
[1:30:27] to be like
[1:30:28] the true church will always try to be
[1:30:31] like the original of pentecost
[1:30:33] the true church of today will try to
[1:30:36] approximate
[1:30:37] that early first one
[1:30:40] and the messengers to the churches
[1:30:42] having the same spirit of god in them
[1:30:44] will try to approximate the apostle paul
[1:30:48] i wonder if our messenger succeeded or
[1:30:50] not
[1:30:52] i think when he went beyond the curtain
[1:30:55] they told him now you just
[1:30:56] you preached what paul preached
[1:31:01] amen so if i messenger approximated the
[1:31:03] apostle paul
[1:31:06] amen his church has got to approximate
[1:31:10] amen the early first one it sees the
[1:31:14] church
[1:31:18] it looks like there ought to be a church
[1:31:20] somewhere that matched her messenger
[1:31:26] hallelujah there's got to be a people
[1:31:30] that matches the word
[1:31:33] hallelujah that you can say we're bone
[1:31:35] of his bones
[1:31:36] we're flesh of his flesh we're light of
[1:31:39] his life
[1:31:40] we're power of his power
[1:31:46] but too often we find christ is missing
[1:31:52] the anointing is gone well brother tim
[1:31:56] there's not supposed to be revival now
[1:31:58] well that's true of the healing revival
[1:32:00] of the 40s and the 50s
[1:32:03] even by the time brother branham left it
[1:32:05] was gasping its last breath
[1:32:07] but that's not true the bride's revival
[1:32:12] but oh yes but brother jim just quieting
[1:32:14] down it's a word revival
[1:32:16] and worth the word revival is just word
[1:32:18] it's word
[1:32:19] it's word it's word you mean powerless
[1:32:24] and meaningless dead lectures
[1:32:29] amen let me tell you what a word revival
[1:32:32] does
[1:32:34] as brother brandon said again in the
[1:32:35] church age book it is a fact
[1:32:37] that the prophet for the last days must
[1:32:40] be bringing
[1:32:40] forth a message from god that will
[1:32:43] forerun the second coming of the lord
[1:32:46] and remember remember he comes as shout
[1:32:50] voice and trump
[1:32:51] somebody help me preach so there is a
[1:32:54] shout in the prophet form bringing the
[1:32:56] word
[1:32:57] there is a voice that must be in the
[1:32:59] pride
[1:33:00] because she must prophesy again and
[1:33:03] become the voice of the written word
[1:33:07] and the spoken word
[1:33:10] and then there's the trump of god where
[1:33:12] we're ascending high
[1:33:15] but what's now he says a message that
[1:33:18] would forerun did you know brother
[1:33:20] branham said
[1:33:21] my mission i believe is for run a coming
[1:33:25] word which is christ
[1:33:28] is that right then he tells us that it
[1:33:31] would be
[1:33:31] he would forerun a bride
[1:33:36] spoken words original seed he foreruns
[1:33:39] the bride
[1:33:41] so you see he listen he has to come
[1:33:45] in bribe form before he can come and
[1:33:49] groom the form
[1:33:51] we want the meeting in there nobody
[1:33:52] wants it
[1:33:54] but the only way he'll ever be is for
[1:33:57] his
[1:33:57] bride to step into the word
[1:34:01] that has been spoken of them
[1:34:05] there's no other way that's right
[1:34:09] amen now again let me see if i can get
[1:34:12] through this quote for you
[1:34:14] it is a fact the prophet for this last
[1:34:16] age must be bringing forth a message
[1:34:18] from god
[1:34:19] that will forerun the second coming of
[1:34:20] the lord for by his message
[1:34:23] will the hearts of the children be
[1:34:25] turned back to the pentecostal fathers
[1:34:29] yes and with
[1:34:32] the restoration of the work
[1:34:36] will come the restoration of the power
[1:34:41] so if it's word word word it has to have
[1:34:45] power
[1:34:46] power power power
[1:34:50] it cannot be a dead laptop it's gonna be
[1:34:54] [Applause]
[1:34:58] alive
[1:35:01] now if it is divine revelation and
[1:35:04] people say well
[1:35:05] brother tim we don't have signs of
[1:35:07] wonder but we got revelation brother we
[1:35:09] got revelation above everybody we're
[1:35:11] we're so revelated
[1:35:16] well here's what true revelation will do
[1:35:19] satan knows
[1:35:21] that if the people get the true
[1:35:23] revelation
[1:35:25] of the true church and what she
[1:35:28] is and what she stands for and that
[1:35:31] she can do she can do
[1:35:35] she can do the greater works
[1:35:39] she will be
[1:35:47] hallelujah that's what true revelation
[1:35:50] will do
[1:35:51] there'll be a revelation of the power of
[1:35:54] god
[1:35:56] it won't be that teaching it will be
[1:35:58] alive
[1:35:59] with power with demonstration
[1:36:06] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:36:16] they can get the true revelation
[1:36:20] a man of the two spirits within the
[1:36:22] framework of the christian
[1:36:24] church and by god's spirit discern and
[1:36:26] withstand
[1:36:27] discern and withstand the antichrist
[1:36:30] spirit
[1:36:31] satan will be powerless
[1:36:36] before
[1:36:39] but too often christ is missing that's
[1:36:42] right
[1:36:43] the anointing is gone no shout out the
[1:36:46] king even in the midst
[1:36:48] that's right brother branham told us
[1:36:51] from the beginning it wasn't so
[1:36:52] and you can trace this whole concept and
[1:36:55] thought all the way to the end
[1:36:57] because i did but he says
[1:37:01] what do you find among our kindreds go
[1:37:03] among the baptists the methodist
[1:37:05] presbyterian
[1:37:07] and so forth and
[1:37:10] and he says see if you find it you don't
[1:37:13] find him among our kin folks like that
[1:37:15] that's the only way
[1:37:16] you you find him is the way mary and
[1:37:18] joseph found him where they left him
[1:37:22] and that's where you find him where'd
[1:37:23] they leave him at the pentecostal feast
[1:37:26] hallelujah that's where the church will
[1:37:28] find him again
[1:37:30] go back to the feast of pentecost
[1:37:34] go back to the pouring out of the holy
[1:37:36] ghost there you will find the power of
[1:37:38] the almighty god
[1:37:39] you'll find the risen christ you'll find
[1:37:41] signs and wonders of him
[1:37:43] just exactly like he said it would be
[1:37:46] go back to where where you found him go
[1:37:48] back to the beginning jesus said at the
[1:37:50] beginning
[1:37:51] and he's preaching at the beginning it
[1:37:52] wasn't so john 15
[1:37:54] chapter jesus said i'm divine you're the
[1:37:57] branches now the first
[1:37:58] branch that came out of that vine they
[1:38:01] wrote a book of acts out to it
[1:38:03] they had the power to heal they had to
[1:38:06] spoke with tongues
[1:38:07] they interpreted they had visions
[1:38:10] prophets
[1:38:11] power they'd done signs that jesus did
[1:38:16] and if that verse branch come out of
[1:38:18] that vine was that kind of a branch
[1:38:20] the next branch will bear the same and
[1:38:23] every branch it bears will be the same
[1:38:26] branch amen if we say we
[1:38:29] are the church of god that will bear
[1:38:31] record
[1:38:32] of the first branch heals the vine if
[1:38:35] you're growing grapes
[1:38:37] and your first bunch of branches produce
[1:38:39] grapes your second branch will produce
[1:38:41] grapes
[1:38:42] your third branch will produce grapes
[1:38:44] every branch the trees bear
[1:38:46] will produce grapes and if the church of
[1:38:49] the living god that jesus christ set up
[1:38:53] i said we methodists want to think
[1:38:54] that's our church we baptist one who
[1:38:57] thinks it's ours
[1:38:58] we're pentecostals one of the things is
[1:39:00] ours we catholics think it's ours
[1:39:01] let it be what it may be but if we are
[1:39:04] in that branch
[1:39:06] we have the same fruits they have you
[1:39:09] can't get
[1:39:10] pumpkins off of a grapevine the bind of
[1:39:13] jesus christ
[1:39:15] will produce the life of jesus christ
[1:39:18] for he is the life that is in the vine
[1:39:21] and we are the branches the first branch
[1:39:24] that came forth was a pentecostal branch
[1:39:28] filled with pentecostal power so the
[1:39:31] impact of the holy ghost
[1:39:32] they staggered under the impact of the
[1:39:34] power of god
[1:39:36] they went forth and saw visions perform
[1:39:39] miracles open the eyes of the blind
[1:39:42] heal the sick joy was in the camp
[1:39:45] they prayed in one accord and all of
[1:39:48] them together and the building shook
[1:39:50] where they were assembled show me your
[1:39:53] church doing that today
[1:39:55] even the pentecostals are getting so dry
[1:39:58] they have a little why they have a
[1:39:59] little ceremonial prayer
[1:40:01] what we need is a prayer meeting that'll
[1:40:04] shake the shingles off the top of the
[1:40:06] house
[1:40:07] and bring god back in the church again
[1:40:09] it wasn't
[1:40:10] so from the beginning all these creeds
[1:40:12] and cold
[1:40:13] formal ritualistic all these different
[1:40:16] things
[1:40:17] it wasn't so from the beginning jesus
[1:40:20] set up a church and said these signs
[1:40:23] shall follow them that believe that was
[1:40:26] the beginning
[1:40:27] that's what happened in the beginning if
[1:40:29] he was here on earth today
[1:40:31] he would not endorse our creeds
[1:40:35] and there are things we're doing i would
[1:40:37] say that you know creed means i believe
[1:40:40] there's many things that are being
[1:40:42] professed around
[1:40:43] in churches today even message churches
[1:40:46] jesus christ would not endorse
[1:40:48] and brother branham would never
[1:40:50] recognize as being his message
[1:40:56] amen he said he would not endorse her
[1:41:00] creeds and things were doing he would
[1:41:01] say
[1:41:02] it wasn't so from the beginning jesus
[1:41:04] said in the beginning the works that i
[1:41:06] do
[1:41:07] so you do also that's the way it was at
[1:41:10] the beginning
[1:41:10] what kind of a works did he do at the
[1:41:12] beginning the same works
[1:41:14] that he's doing now what kind of church
[1:41:16] did he have at the beginning
[1:41:18] a church that was filled with the
[1:41:20] spirits that healed the sick
[1:41:22] prophesied great signs and wonders they
[1:41:26] weren't ashamed of their religion
[1:41:28] hello and then they shouted and danced
[1:41:31] under the spirit
[1:41:33] like drunk men they had cloven tongues
[1:41:36] like fire
[1:41:37] that set upon them they've done signs
[1:41:39] and wonders
[1:41:40] and exploits followed them that was the
[1:41:43] kind it wasn't the beginning
[1:41:45] that's the kind it'll be in the middle
[1:41:47] that's the kind it'll be at the last
[1:41:50] and you say well my church don't teach
[1:41:52] that it wasn't so from the beginning
[1:41:55] you say i'm a methodist it wasn't so
[1:41:57] from the beginning
[1:41:58] you said i'm baptist it wasn't so from
[1:42:01] the beginning
[1:42:02] i'm lutheran it wasn't so from the
[1:42:04] beginning
[1:42:05] they were baptized saints of god with
[1:42:08] the holy ghost
[1:42:09] that's what the beginning was signs and
[1:42:12] wonders
[1:42:13] you say my church don't believe in it it
[1:42:15] wasn't so from the beginning
[1:42:17] my church don't see believe in seeing
[1:42:20] vision
[1:42:21] it wasn't so from the beginning and my
[1:42:24] church says days of maryland as it
[1:42:26] passed
[1:42:26] it wasn't so from the beginning my
[1:42:29] church don't believe in the baptism of
[1:42:31] the holy oath
[1:42:32] it wasn't solved from the beginning i
[1:42:35] tell you
[1:42:35] god wants a people that is consecrated
[1:42:39] by the power of god let us surrender
[1:42:42] their
[1:42:42] intellectuals and let god come in and
[1:42:45] take over and give a new birth
[1:42:47] let's go back to the beginning if we
[1:42:49] want to see the sick healed
[1:42:51] we want to see signs and wonders of the
[1:42:53] living christ
[1:42:54] go back to the beginning where we left
[1:42:56] him and we left him at the pentecostal
[1:42:58] feast
[1:43:01] we've been wandering around 2000 years
[1:43:05] gentile church ages but there's a people
[1:43:09] coming back to the beginning
[1:43:13] hallelujah amen bring us back
[1:43:18] back to a living faith in a living god
[1:43:21] with
[1:43:21] living presence ever with us to the end
[1:43:23] of the world

[1:43:39] this or that or two two lords or
[1:43:43] or whatever you are go back to the
[1:43:46] beginning

[1:43:52] you won't find two lords
[1:43:55] come on you will you won't find some
[1:43:58] some idea oh he's already come but we
[1:44:01] don't know where he's at
[1:44:04] you you won't find something that you
[1:44:06] just hear in some word form that
[1:44:08] that is powerless because it's really
[1:44:11] not word it's intellectual
[1:44:12] word has power in it by the word he
[1:44:16] created a word
[1:44:18] but things into existence that's what
[1:44:20] the word does
[1:44:22] yes
[1:44:26] hallelujah oh my
[1:44:29] i tell you what this this is wonderful
[1:44:33] you say brother tim that was what was
[1:44:35] that 1960 maybe
[1:44:37] that was before the seals you know okay
[1:44:41] united time and sign 1963
[1:44:45] august 18th what did he say in malachi 4
[1:44:49] would restore
[1:44:50] restore back the original pentecostal
[1:44:53] faith
[1:44:54] back to the people with the same not
[1:44:56] different
[1:44:57] the same pentecostal message the same
[1:45:01] pentecostal sign the same pentecostal
[1:45:04] evidence
[1:45:05] the same god same power same treatment
[1:45:08] everything
[1:45:09] exactly with the vindication of the same
[1:45:11] pillar of fire that struck paul
[1:45:13] strolled down on the road down to
[1:45:15] damascus is among us today doing the
[1:45:17] same thing he did in that day
[1:45:20] that's what you're united with
[1:45:23] now i want to remind you brother branham
[1:45:25] saw the church
[1:45:27] in a vision he saw it start out in the
[1:45:29] beginning a virgin
[1:45:31] walking with the word holy neatly
[1:45:34] dressed
[1:45:35] beautiful group of women you know
[1:45:38] marching to the tune of onwards
[1:45:40] christian songs then it wasn't long till
[1:45:43] they begin to march to the beat of
[1:45:46] another drummer
[1:45:50] some modern day something another
[1:45:53] rock and roll stuff
[1:45:57] amen you said wow brother tim i i don't
[1:45:59] hear no rock and roll in that church
[1:46:01] they can be rocking and rolling to some
[1:46:04] modern day beat
[1:46:06] that jesus christ isn't the same or he's
[1:46:09] not here the way he was with brother
[1:46:11] branham
[1:46:12] or we're not in the season for miracles
[1:46:16] that ain't nothing but uh but just
[1:46:19] backslidden
[1:46:22] beat of the devil the wrong kind of
[1:46:25] music
[1:46:26] i'm going to tell you when the seals
[1:46:28] were open the bright southern new song
[1:46:32] hallelujah saying thou are worthy to
[1:46:34] take the book in the open the seals
[1:46:44] and thou has made us to our god kings
[1:46:46] and priests
[1:46:48] it didn't make us backslidden pure
[1:46:52] warming
[1:46:56] just church goers memberships
[1:46:59] belonging to a church society it produ
[1:47:03] let me tell you the true gospel produces
[1:47:05] old-fashioned
[1:47:07] born again holy ghost
[1:47:10] glory to god come on hey man you say
[1:47:14] well brother tim
[1:47:14] what are you trying to do to get us all
[1:47:16] to speak in tongues well paul said
[1:47:18] freaking
[1:47:18] not speaking in tongues
[1:47:22] all right man it wasn't hard for you to
[1:47:23] have that experience brother brandon
[1:47:25] said if you laid under the altar of god
[1:47:26] long enough you would sooner or later
[1:47:29] ever mind if you just get under the
[1:47:31] altar of god
[1:47:34] amen he also told us the spies not
[1:47:36] prophesying despise not speaking in
[1:47:38] tongues
[1:47:40] why are we despising it
[1:47:46] no it's not the evidence no it's not
[1:47:50] the initial evidence
[1:47:53] it does it is an evidence of the holy
[1:47:56] ghost
[1:47:57] but it's not the evidence
[1:48:01] but it does you know the holy ghost does
[1:48:03] speak with genuine tongues
[1:48:08] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:48:13] i just punched a button on the radio
[1:48:16] today and heard a preacher
[1:48:18] a preacher come on and he said you're
[1:48:20] down to ziggler
[1:48:21] and god's gonna restore everything
[1:48:35] [Applause]
[1:48:44] hallelujah
[1:48:45] [Applause]
[1:48:55] let me tell you if you've been out of
[1:48:57] line that don't mean you're not bright
[1:49:00] [Applause]
[1:49:03] the bride got out of step but the
[1:49:06] prophet's voice screamed out
[1:49:08] get back alive get back in line
[1:49:12] i'm using that prophet's voice get back
[1:49:15] in line
[1:49:15] get back in step with the message
[1:49:20] you walk to the truth of all these
[1:49:22] better false doctrines
[1:49:24] we're walking that way with the word
[1:49:31] [Music]
[1:49:39] so he said i watched her come down i saw
[1:49:42] it changed
[1:49:43] i saw miss america i saw the church of
[1:49:47] america
[1:49:48] i saw that backslidden group naked
[1:49:51] shrimp there's no holy ghost
[1:49:56] no power of god
[1:50:00] no gifts of the spirit
[1:50:03] we despise prophecy we despise speaking
[1:50:06] in tongues
[1:50:08] that's the church of america
[1:50:13] i saw her and he said is this what my
[1:50:16] message produced
[1:50:18] and he said i just about fainted and
[1:50:21] about that time i heard that same
[1:50:23] music coming again and i heard him say
[1:50:26] the bride
[1:50:27] will come back in preview again
[1:50:30] lord of god i've not been seen i've been
[1:50:33] seen in a vision
[1:50:36] walk in and step with the word
[1:50:39] hallelujah listen to him he said and
[1:50:42] when
[1:50:43] she walked by she was exactly
[1:50:46] like the first one in the first place
[1:50:50] walk into the step of the music of god's
[1:50:52] word
[1:50:53] marching on and i stood with my hands up
[1:50:56] crying like that came myself on the step
[1:50:59] on the porch out there looking across
[1:51:01] the field what
[1:51:02] she is to be the same bride the same
[1:51:05] kind
[1:51:06] built out of the same kind of material
[1:51:09] that she was in the first place
[1:51:11] now read malachi 4 and see if we're not
[1:51:13] supposed to have a message
[1:51:15] in the last days that had turned the
[1:51:17] hearts of the children
[1:51:18] back to the fathers
[1:51:22] how close brother to him back to the
[1:51:25] original pentecostal message
[1:51:28] word by word
[1:51:32] then he says brothers
[1:51:36] we are here i want to
[1:51:39] echo that this morning we are here
[1:51:42] this is where we are
[1:51:49] now what all the bride of christ be
[1:51:51] doing
[1:51:52] just what all we've seen 60 plus years
[1:51:57] of kingdom building
[1:51:59] that removes the power of god from
[1:52:01] people and made pastors
[1:52:03] dictators what is all this years of
[1:52:07] teaching done when we should have had
[1:52:08] preaching
[1:52:09] amen demonstrating the gospel
[1:52:14] so brother tim you teach when i taught
[1:52:17] my wife received the baptism of the holy
[1:52:19] ghost
[1:52:20] and in that same service our first
[1:52:22] elected deacon
[1:52:23] brother jerome butts received the
[1:52:25] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:52:33] it was no dry word it was the power of
[1:52:37] god demonstrated
[1:52:43] god of this evil age brother branham
[1:52:45] tells us
[1:52:46] where we should be and what we have let
[1:52:49] happen
[1:52:49] and we've let it happen again
[1:52:52] because the cycle of revival and death
[1:52:55] never
[1:52:56] ceases never dies
[1:52:59] goes right down revival down unto death
[1:53:05] but god's going to have somebody to
[1:53:06] break the cycle
[1:53:08] how do you know that because he said
[1:53:09] i'll have a bride without spot a wrinkle
[1:53:12] because he said of them that alive and
[1:53:14] remain
[1:53:20] now she has caused the whole church to
[1:53:23] accept the scientific leadership
[1:53:25] of the educational program and that's
[1:53:27] what we've had educational programs
[1:53:29] educating oh these greek words and this
[1:53:32] and
[1:53:33] that and the other and we got this and
[1:53:35] brother you better be saying this right
[1:53:37] no
[1:53:37] now we're going to introduce another
[1:53:39] greek word this week and
[1:53:40] you know we just got forms of doctrine
[1:53:43] and whatever
[1:53:44] satan under has given her under a name
[1:53:46] of a church
[1:53:47] the leadership of an educational
[1:53:50] scientific program
[1:53:51] i'm pitching to you the god of this
[1:53:53] world when she has
[1:53:55] eve had the very filling of god's word
[1:53:57] in her hands she could have took god's
[1:53:59] word
[1:53:59] but what did she do to that
[1:54:03] instead of carrying for the baptism
[1:54:06] of the holy ghost let science prove to
[1:54:10] her
[1:54:11] the holy ghost was only for the
[1:54:12] disciples
[1:54:15] instead of keeping divine healing going
[1:54:18] when she ought to be now raising the
[1:54:22] dead
[1:54:23] and doing great miracles she has let
[1:54:26] satan under his leadership of religious
[1:54:30] man take the word of god and try to say
[1:54:33] that it was for another age and they
[1:54:36] have believed it
[1:54:39] now what will the church be doing not
[1:54:42] only should it
[1:54:43] be the book of acts be our example of
[1:54:45] holy ghost power
[1:54:47] it should be our textbook you know it
[1:54:50] should be
[1:54:51] it should be the uh our text because it
[1:54:54] defines
[1:54:55] the triumphs of the name of jesus
[1:54:58] the acts of the holy ghost the disciples
[1:55:01] in the book of acts had
[1:55:02] authority that was granted to them from
[1:55:05] heaven
[1:55:06] that was conferred on them by jesus
[1:55:08] christ himself
[1:55:09] amen they were endued with power
[1:55:12] from on high these men after receiving
[1:55:15] the holy ghost
[1:55:17] they didn't wait on the squeeze of
[1:55:19] persecution to come
[1:55:21] and to give them power
[1:55:27] you know why that would make god
[1:55:29] tomorrow but not god today
[1:55:34] first of all this if the squeeze of
[1:55:37] persecution brings faith for a rapture
[1:55:40] and the works of god then the dark ages
[1:55:43] should have been
[1:55:44] raptured with that brutal persecution
[1:55:51] and if so then that would have been the
[1:55:54] thing that would have started the
[1:55:55] rapture in faith for the going away
[1:55:57] if persecution can do it second i'm
[1:56:01] fully aware that brother branham
[1:56:02] pondered
[1:56:03] and um and surmised that the third pull
[1:56:06] of his ministry would be manifested
[1:56:08] during a squeeze or but at the feast of
[1:56:12] the trumpets he turns a corner
[1:56:14] as joshua he's given division of the
[1:56:17] land
[1:56:18] you know certain parts we don't fulfill
[1:56:21] all the parts of the bible
[1:56:24] there is a in the book of
[1:56:26] revelation
[1:56:27] that we we will not fulfill there is a
[1:56:30] foolish virgin
[1:56:32] a multitude without number in the
[1:56:34] tribulation
[1:56:35] we will not fulfill there is a hundred
[1:56:38] and forty four
[1:56:39] thousand that and that are to the jews
[1:56:43] and and they will fulfill that not us
[1:56:48] so you want you got to know you know
[1:56:52] your borders of your land
[1:56:54] because the land is big you know there's
[1:56:57] land from moab there's land over here
[1:56:59] for esau
[1:57:02] come on esau is also a seat of abraham
[1:57:05] there's land for the ishmaelites there's
[1:57:06] land for the moabites this children of
[1:57:08] lot
[1:57:10] they they also are coming down and
[1:57:12] receiving blessings
[1:57:14] somebody with me i'm but then but then
[1:57:17] there's the seed of abraham
[1:57:19] and what land are they given i mean when
[1:57:23] they went into the land he said don't
[1:57:24] you try to take esau's portion it's not
[1:57:27] yours
[1:57:28] don't possess it i won't bless you now
[1:57:30] don't try to take these others
[1:57:32] that is not your land i will define your
[1:57:35] borders and joshua was given
[1:57:37] from the definition of the borders word
[1:57:40] that it goes
[1:57:41] and he was given the landmarks now god
[1:57:44] sent
[1:57:44] in this day a prophetic ministry
[1:57:48] and it would also be as a joshua
[1:57:51] i know joe coleman thought he was the
[1:57:53] joshua
[1:57:54] you know that's going to bring us into
[1:57:56] into a higher
[1:57:58] uh higher order and all of that these
[1:58:00] are liars
[1:58:02] he didn't bring into him bringing the
[1:58:05] higher order he took them back in the
[1:58:06] depths of sin and unbelief
[1:58:08] i i don't mean to be ugly i i'm speaking
[1:58:11] truthful
[1:58:13] and sometimes you just have to talk
[1:58:14] truth
[1:58:16] and so you know again you know there was
[1:58:20] let me just say in that you know
[1:58:23] when there was no other man in this day
[1:58:26] that i'm aware of
[1:58:28] that the bible comes down out of heaven
[1:58:32] and the page is turning
[1:58:36] and as the page is turning it turns to
[1:58:39] joshua chapter one
[1:58:41] and as it does a finger goes down
[1:58:48] from verse 1 down through about verse 9
[1:58:52] saying as i was with moses
[1:58:55] so will i be with you
[1:58:59] you know don't be don't fail don't be
[1:59:01] discouraged
[1:59:03] amen be of good courage for i have given
[1:59:05] you the land
[1:59:06] if there was anybody that we should
[1:59:08] recognize as
[1:59:10] as being the joshua to give us the
[1:59:12] definitions of the border of the land
[1:59:15] it should be the prophet of malachi 4
[1:59:19] who was not only elijah but he was also
[1:59:21] the joshua
[1:59:23] to place us in our inheritance
[1:59:26] and there at the feast of the trumpet
[1:59:29] you know brother branham
[1:59:30] turns a corner he said you know it was
[1:59:32] revealed him those trumpets were to the
[1:59:34] jews
[1:59:35] and they received their persecution in a
[1:59:38] physical
[1:59:39] literal manner to drive them back to
[1:59:41] their homeland
[1:59:43] while the bride spiritual israel
[1:59:45] receives theirs
[1:59:46] in an ecclesiastical manner
[1:59:51] that's from the pulpit people
[1:59:54] beat from the pulpit
[1:59:57] killed from the pulpit people burned up
[2:00:01] in furnaces at the pulpit
[2:00:04] a holocaust from the pulpit
[2:00:07] ecclesiastical
[2:00:10] and so have we been beat and abused and
[2:00:13] imprisoned
[2:00:14] and many are dead from false
[2:00:17] ecclesiastical attacks
[2:00:18] from the pulpit against the movement of
[2:00:21] the holy spirit
[2:00:22] with false apostles and false teachers
[2:00:25] rising up claiming greater revelation
[2:00:27] than the prophet
[2:00:29] some deifying brother branham and others
[2:00:32] denying the deity of jesus christ what
[2:00:34] an awful evil spirit
[2:00:36] so until they're so confused when with
[2:00:39] such
[2:00:40] blind with double vision that they have
[2:00:43] two lords and two jehovah's and two
[2:00:45] jesus
[2:00:48] what kind of confusion is that
[2:00:55] i tell you what you need to myself
[2:00:59] that only malachi 4 the seventh angel
[2:01:02] can bring
[2:01:03] to put in your eyes as i preach this i'm
[2:01:07] not in in
[2:01:08] any way saying i'm the only pebble on
[2:01:10] the beach listen you don't ever have to
[2:01:12] even hear the name of tim pruitt to be
[2:01:14] saved or go in the rapture you got to
[2:01:17] know jesus
[2:01:20] amen i'm not trying to build a kingdom
[2:01:22] here i'm trying to point you to christ
[2:01:28] but let me just say neither if you have
[2:01:31] seat belts on
[2:01:32] it might get kind of stormy on this
[2:01:35] plane ride we might have some turbulence
[2:01:37] here
[2:01:38] it might upset some of you
[2:01:42] neither did the disciples wait on the
[2:01:45] third pull to come so they could have
[2:01:48] power
[2:01:52] unless let me qualify that unless the
[2:01:55] third pole
[2:01:57] pulled them into christ they pulled them
[2:01:59] into christ was
[2:02:00] justification and another pull into
[2:02:03] sanctification
[2:02:05] and then the third pull happens in the
[2:02:06] soul the with the realm of the baptism
[2:02:08] of the holy ghost
[2:02:10] because that's where you receive power
[2:02:15] only there with the baptism of the holy
[2:02:17] ghost as the third pull work
[2:02:21] in case you think i'm way out of line go
[2:02:23] listen to there is a man
[2:02:25] here that can turn on the light and
[2:02:27] brother branham uses this analogy
[2:02:31] and as for waiting on the third pull
[2:02:35] i want to declare to you it's already
[2:02:37] come
[2:02:41] in fact it's here not coming it's here
[2:02:45] it is now you know why because god's
[2:02:47] word is always
[2:02:48] now it was manifested
[2:02:52] five different times where the word was
[2:02:54] showed
[2:02:55] in its power was speaking creation
[2:02:59] speaking life resurrection life little
[2:03:02] fish
[2:03:03] speaking healing sister branham speaking
[2:03:07] salvation
[2:03:08] had it right amen by the way
[2:03:11] that still works there's many a time as
[2:03:16] i spoke the word as i preached souls ran
[2:03:19] to the altar
[2:03:21] and had the same experience that he
[2:03:24] talked about
[2:03:25] had he writes children having i want to
[2:03:28] tell you
[2:03:28] every child of god who has been born
[2:03:32] again by the holy ghost
[2:03:33] has had a spoken word experience
[2:03:37] peter said you are born not a
[2:03:40] corruptible seed
[2:03:41] but of the word of god that liveth and
[2:03:44] abideth forever
[2:03:45] [Applause]
[2:03:48] my birth is a spoken word
[2:03:51] birth not my physical one my spiritual
[2:03:54] one
[2:04:00] and then finally speaking to storms
[2:04:03] which changes atmospheres
[2:04:05] now that shows the power of the speak in
[2:04:08] the word that was given to us as a sword
[2:04:10] which would just fit brother branham's
[2:04:12] hand because that message is our message
[2:04:15] and that sword is our sword
[2:04:19] now the third pull brother branham
[2:04:22] actually talks about it in the past
[2:04:24] since
[2:04:25] 10th sense and and as just before he
[2:04:28] leaves the scene and
[2:04:29] the anointed ones at the end time he
[2:04:31] said the first poll was
[2:04:33] healing the second poll prophesying
[2:04:36] third paul the opening of the word
[2:04:39] the mystery's revealed no more there's
[2:04:41] no more higher order to reveal the word
[2:04:43] than prophets
[2:04:44] but the only way a prophet can be
[2:04:46] vindicated is by the word and remember
[2:04:48] the third pull was
[2:04:53] the opening of them seven seals to
[2:04:56] reveal the hidden truth that's been
[2:04:58] sealed
[2:05:00] in the word amen
[2:05:03] so you see the their pool has already
[2:05:06] come
[2:05:08] it opened up the word it took the
[2:05:11] the seals off the book and opened the
[2:05:15] land
[2:05:16] to us
[2:05:20] that was the third phase of brother
[2:05:22] branham's ministry
[2:05:24] and now we're not in the first pool
[2:05:26] where the signs in the hand
[2:05:28] we are not in the second poll where
[2:05:30] there's prophesying discerning the
[2:05:32] hearts
[2:05:35] we are in the third pull which is the
[2:05:37] opening
[2:05:38] of the word the seven seals
[2:05:42] opening up the mysteries of the word
[2:05:45] wiping out the debt
[2:05:46] against us so all the false doctrines
[2:05:49] and the liens that was against us was
[2:05:51] removed from the title
[2:05:53] so that you have received the same
[2:05:56] open book that paul had
[2:06:02] which brings us i know sometimes you say
[2:06:05] brother them nothing goes way over my
[2:06:06] head
[2:06:07] i've got to preach it to you and get it
[2:06:09] maybe
[2:06:11] sometimes i just need to sit down with
[2:06:12] some of you one on one
[2:06:16] just find out where you're missing it at
[2:06:18] this is not
[2:06:19] hard this is not rocket science this is
[2:06:22] the word of god
[2:06:25] and that opens us up to exactly where
[2:06:28] paul was where he says
[2:06:29] we are now seated in heavenly places
[2:06:34] in christ jesus
[2:06:38] where where are the middle ages didn't
[2:06:40] have deprivedness at the beginning it's
[2:06:42] the pride at the end
[2:06:46] you say there's no more innocence nobody
[2:06:49] has an intercessor like
[2:06:51] [Music]
[2:06:56] us
[2:07:00] now let me just go on
[2:07:03] neither do they wait on some future
[2:07:05] adoption
[2:07:08] word that they would finally get enough
[2:07:10] faith to believe
[2:07:13] oh we'll grow up one day brother tim you
[2:07:16] know look we just can't overcome all
[2:07:18] this sin and
[2:07:19] that stuff and you know we just adding
[2:07:22] our faith and virtue and
[2:07:23] knowledge and temperance and i mean you
[2:07:26] know we got to grow up and this is
[2:07:27] what's the matter with our
[2:07:28] churches brother tim you know it's just
[2:07:31] that they're immature and
[2:07:32] you know they ain't grown up there they
[2:07:34] got the holy ghost and
[2:07:36] you know they've been baptized with the
[2:07:37] holy ghost but they
[2:07:39] just can't overcome their uh you know
[2:07:41] they drink a little wine
[2:07:42] and wine here and they won't attend
[2:07:45] church none and
[2:07:46] you know they just um you know i tell
[2:07:49] you what they
[2:07:50] they just um struggle with with sex sins
[2:07:53] and
[2:07:54] i i just tell my church you know brother
[2:07:56] tim i just tell them
[2:07:58] you know you've got to let the the word
[2:08:00] abide in you richly and you're just not
[2:08:02] letting him abide and
[2:08:03] you know i got you know we got to have
[2:08:06] some
[2:08:06] you're all right you're all right
[2:08:08] brother you know sister you're all right
[2:08:10] you
[2:08:11] you just need to grow up a little bit
[2:08:13] but one day
[2:08:15] one day we're going to get this adoption
[2:08:18] and
[2:08:19] we'll uh we'll be adopted since then
[2:08:22] devil had to hide from us then but now
[2:08:25] we're kind of cowered around in the
[2:08:26] corner when cancer comes
[2:08:34] hello the disciples the book of acts
[2:08:37] church
[2:08:38] didn't wait on some future adoption
[2:08:40] where they'd get faith enough to believe
[2:08:43] that faith was born in them by the holy
[2:08:47] ghost
[2:08:47] [Applause]
[2:08:48] hallelujah these are just excuses
[2:08:53] we got to wait till the squeeze come we
[2:08:54] got to wait till the bride comes into
[2:08:56] power
[2:08:56] we got to wait until we got to wait
[2:08:58] until we're mature enough
[2:08:59] we got to grow up we're just immature
[2:09:01] now it's just not the season
[2:09:03] you know because we're nobody's got the
[2:09:05] faith
[2:09:09] this is kind of unbelief being preached
[2:09:14] it's worse than alexander campbell with
[2:09:17] the church of christ
[2:09:19] because they're using quotes to try to
[2:09:22] make it happen
[2:09:25] let me just tell you my brother the
[2:09:28] apostles didn't make excuses
[2:09:32] or we are too immature but one day we're
[2:09:34] when we're mature
[2:09:36] or we're waiting on adoption let me stop
[2:09:38] for a minute
[2:09:40] again you know that that's it
[2:09:44] we we got the holy ghost we got it when
[2:09:45] we believe the words you know and so we
[2:09:47] didn't really know it we just believe
[2:09:49] the word and we
[2:09:49] we just believe we got it
[2:09:53] and so because we accepted the message
[2:09:56] and because we believe god sent a
[2:09:58] prophet and it's the revelation
[2:10:00] and i i accept this revelation well i
[2:10:03] now have the holy ghost
[2:10:05] you know because uh the holy ghost will
[2:10:06] believe the word you know and it say
[2:10:08] amen say amen
[2:10:13] amen that's right that's right that's
[2:10:15] right i i don't understand that i have
[2:10:17] no idea what you're talking about but
[2:10:18] amen
[2:10:19] because i got the holy ghost
[2:10:23] well i can't live right but one day i'll
[2:10:26] get adopted one day i'll be one day
[2:10:29] i remember it was 1985.
[2:10:33] and yeah i don't know my my genealogy
[2:10:37] says i got a little
[2:10:38] cherokee in me and i must have pulled up
[2:10:40] the hatchet
[2:10:44] but it was late in 1984 i went to tucson
[2:10:47] meeting and there i watched a man you
[2:10:49] know that was put up there because he
[2:10:51] had some money
[2:10:52] and he could talk because he had some
[2:10:54] money and he was doing scams and he
[2:10:56] wound up
[2:10:57] you know wound up being put in prison
[2:10:59] for it
[2:11:00] and he had some cohorts there with him
[2:11:02] two of them
[2:11:04] that was um there was actually three
[2:11:06] that was
[2:11:07] a fellow by the name of ernie villanueva
[2:11:09] the other was
[2:11:11] ron nordone and the other was arne
[2:11:13] marcioni
[2:11:15] and arnie got up in that meeting and he
[2:11:17] said well praise god i got the holy
[2:11:19] ghost he as i tell you
[2:11:20] i got the holy ghost here you know i
[2:11:23] know i've been baptized because i've
[2:11:25] received the message i'll tell you but
[2:11:27] you know i got this little problem with
[2:11:28] smoking and i really can't i really care
[2:11:32] you know one day god
[2:11:33] just take it from me one day i'll just
[2:11:36] get my faith in it
[2:11:38] it'll just get you know it'll just go
[2:11:39] away but i got the holy ghost praise
[2:11:42] god i got it he's making a witness like
[2:11:44] that why
[2:11:45] when i witnessed ernie here
[2:11:49] you know i tell you he was in the full
[2:11:51] gospel businessmen meeting and i sat
[2:11:53] down with him
[2:11:54] at a table i thought i would help him
[2:11:56] out a little bit because what he said
[2:11:58] sounded like
[2:11:58] eagle food and he said so i
[2:12:03] i said to him what are you he said well
[2:12:05] i'm upc
[2:12:07] and i and ernie deville in the waiver
[2:12:09] said yeah i'm upc
[2:12:11] and he said well do you know god sent a
[2:12:13] prophet
[2:12:15] no i didn't know god sent a prophet well
[2:12:18] he got to trying to talk to him
[2:12:20] he couldn't explain it you know he got
[2:12:22] his words all tunneled tangled up and
[2:12:25] you know ernie just kept putting him in
[2:12:26] this you know putting him down putting
[2:12:28] him down
[2:12:29] use the scripture that scripture and
[2:12:31] arnie gets home

[2:12:39] grabs him a joint of marijuana he smokes
[2:12:41] his marijuana
[2:12:43] oh he's anointed now
[2:12:46] he walks back in and he he's on fire now
[2:12:50] and he sits right there and he said all
[2:12:52] right god's in a prophet
[2:12:55] and here's his message and i'm going to
[2:12:57] give you a bunch of books well ernie
[2:13:02] took him said well maybe i can help this
[2:13:04] poor guy but my goodness he
[2:13:06] you know he thinks he's anointed because
[2:13:08] he got a joint
[2:13:11] ain't that awful that we have to get a
[2:13:12] joint of marijuana to get anointed
[2:13:23] so it was in june of 1985.
[2:13:26] let me let me just tell you so anyway
[2:13:29] you know
[2:13:30] he gave this book these parcels of books
[2:13:33] this is their testimony

[2:13:38] books to
[2:13:39] to um ernie and ernie read them and he
[2:13:41] said well man
[2:13:43] this is good stuff he said where'd you
[2:13:44] get this he said you like it

[2:13:52] vacation and our brother ernie started
[2:13:54] reading and he read one
[2:13:56] read another read another read another
[2:13:57] read another read another
[2:13:59] by the time you read it he was convinced
[2:14:01] the message was true

[2:14:14] and they asked me to come along with
[2:14:16] them for lunch
[2:14:20] well i'd already heard their testimony
[2:14:22] in tucson

[2:15:18] you might have got a new heart where you
[2:15:20] desire have a new desire
[2:15:22] and want to do right and there's some of
[2:15:23] you sitting in that condition today but
[2:15:25] you'll go to hell
[2:15:26] if you'll miss the rapture if you don't
[2:15:28] get the holy ghost
[2:15:30] [Music]
[2:15:32] do you hear what i'm saying amen but
[2:15:34] there as i talked to them i said but

[2:20:04] i still got a little more time here on
[2:20:06] the clock
[2:20:09] hallelujah now so as i said neither did
[2:20:12] they
[2:20:13] wait on some future adoption
[2:20:16] when they would finally get enough faith
[2:20:18] to believe
[2:20:19] that faith was born in them by the holy
[2:20:22] ghost so i'm just saying brothers
[2:20:24] out there as you're listening to me
[2:20:25] don't make excuses
[2:20:27] the apostles didn't make excuses that
[2:20:29] we're too immature but one day we'll be
[2:20:31] when we are mature one day when we're
[2:20:34] waiting on adoption
[2:20:35] or persecution the squeeze will make us
[2:20:38] believe
[2:20:38] that's catholicism
[2:20:42] if you think you're going to have to pay
[2:20:46] for something to get this faith
[2:20:49] by doing some kind of penance going
[2:20:52] through some type of persecution
[2:20:55] then you're a catholic in your faith
[2:20:59] brother branham told us and thou knowest
[2:21:01] all things he says
[2:21:03] ephesians 4 30 grieve not the holy
[2:21:05] spirit of god where you're sealed to the
[2:21:07] day of redemption how many can say
[2:21:08] that's me
[2:21:09] amen let the devil kick you around
[2:21:12] that's the trouble of it today
[2:21:14] another christian person sitting there
[2:21:16] sick if they only knew
[2:21:18] they were sons and daughters of god now
[2:21:20] living with christ
[2:21:22] not you will be now you are the sons of
[2:21:24] god you got the full
[2:21:25] pentecostal blessing the day of
[2:21:28] pentecost fully come
[2:21:30] 1900 years ago and never left and never
[2:21:33] will till jesus comes
[2:21:35] now is the hour now is the time now is
[2:21:37] accepted our this is acceptable year of
[2:21:39] the lord
[2:21:40] now is when healing is supposed to be
[2:21:42] now is when miracles take place
[2:21:44] now is when christ is revealing himself
[2:21:46] here we are
[2:21:47] now not in the future
[2:21:50] the devil keeps pushing it at all that
[2:21:54] catholicism now is the day this
[2:21:57] is the hour this is the time this is the
[2:21:59] place right now
[2:22:00] this is the day amen
[2:22:05] now all the preachers have made excuses
[2:22:07] for where there is no power no gifts
[2:22:10] the real reason is because of dead
[2:22:12] sermons
[2:22:14] and dead sermons kill
[2:22:17] so well we're preaching doctrine brother
[2:22:19] tim so you know we're teaching doctrine
[2:22:21] what jesus doctrine
[2:22:23] was a lot different from the pharisees
[2:22:26] and
[2:22:26] our doctrine should be a lot different
[2:22:28] from denominations
[2:22:30] are you with me because mark 1 27 says
[2:22:33] that the it says the people that heard
[2:22:36] him exclaimed
[2:22:38] what new doctrine is this for with
[2:22:40] authority
[2:22:42] commandeth he even the unclean spirits
[2:22:46] and they do obey him
[2:22:49] so if we're preaching the doctrine of
[2:22:51] jesus
[2:22:54] amen it is a doctrine with authority
[2:22:57] over devils
[2:22:58] sickness disease sin
[2:23:02] you know what brother tim you're you're
[2:23:03] really too shallow you know you just
[2:23:05] you just preach faith you're just so
[2:23:07] shallow that's all you do
[2:23:09] just preach faith faith faith there's
[2:23:11] nothing deep about it
[2:23:12] well i'll tell you you've got to preach
[2:23:14] faith to have faith
[2:23:17] amen and faith is of great necessity
[2:23:20] because without faith it's impossible to
[2:23:23] please god
[2:23:25] and besides that whatsoever is not a
[2:23:27] faith is a sin
[2:23:30] amen so i'd love rather be preaching
[2:23:32] faith to you
[2:23:33] than i believe uh-huh
[2:23:36] amen because you're one doing one
[2:23:38] another you're either preaching faith
[2:23:40] or doubt amen the disciples had received
[2:23:43] power
[2:23:44] we know and authority after the holy
[2:23:47] ghost was given to them
[2:23:48] and they would act in his name the first
[2:23:52] recorded use of that authority
[2:23:55] was with authoritative words from that
[2:23:58] peter used to command the lame man
[2:24:01] to walk and and that when he
[2:24:05] rose up and walked that moved the city
[2:24:07] it took jerusalem
[2:24:09] but it showed that that name has power
[2:24:13] and that his children have the right to
[2:24:16] use that man
[2:24:18] notice what it is it showed they were
[2:24:20] the children of god
[2:24:22] it showed they had the right to use that
[2:24:24] name and it showed that that
[2:24:25] name had power in it now peter used his
[2:24:29] authority
[2:24:30] and the power of that name to strike a
[2:24:33] man or a woman
[2:24:34] dead for lying there was awesome power
[2:24:38] in that name there was power to heal
[2:24:42] power to slay power to rise up
[2:24:45] and power to cast down amen
[2:24:48] now you think that's only history that
[2:24:50] only happened back then
[2:24:52] brother branham and his last words to
[2:24:54] the messenger to this age
[2:24:56] and the message communion said the hour
[2:24:58] will soon arise
[2:24:59] when right among us will be the holy
[2:25:02] spirit will speak out like an anonymous
[2:25:04] fire remember that the hour is arriving
[2:25:07] now you just remember that that god is
[2:25:10] going to dwell among his people
[2:25:12] that's what he wants to do
[2:25:16] now amen now
[2:25:19] paul he he calls blindness to come upon
[2:25:22] the opposers
[2:25:23] he cast demons from the mediums
[2:25:27] he was bit by a viper and it did him no
[2:25:30] harm
[2:25:31] the sick were healed the dead were
[2:25:33] raised and whole heathen cities came to
[2:25:36] know the unknown god
[2:25:40] jesus christ amen
[2:25:44] the gospel went everywhere in power it
[2:25:46] was backed by the
[2:25:47] by the power of the name aprons were
[2:25:50] touched by
[2:25:51] paul that were laid on the sick and did
[2:25:54] the same
[2:25:55] mighty acts through as the paul was
[2:25:58] there
[2:26:00] the same happens today you know amen the
[2:26:03] same day sister atlanta was healed of
[2:26:05] non-hodgkin's lymph lymphoma and minds

[2:28:46] incredible
[2:28:47] thank you jesus
[2:28:52] hallelujah
[2:28:56] so the gospel paul preached
[2:29:00] still works today
[2:29:03] hallelujah those book of acts christians
[2:29:07] were human
[2:29:08] just like we are it wasn't superhumans
[2:29:12] they were humans just like me and you a
[2:29:14] man they had passions like ours
[2:29:16] they made mistakes like we do they got
[2:29:19] rebuked
[2:29:21] yet they wrought miracles by the
[2:29:24] authority given to them by a holy ghost
[2:29:26] birth
[2:29:26] they were sons they understood their
[2:29:29] sonship
[2:29:31] they took authority over demons and
[2:29:33] diseases
[2:29:35] preachers were dangerous in that day
[2:29:38] amen christians had
[2:29:39] power to prove their claims i mean they
[2:29:42] pray what they preach
[2:29:43] they practice amen they delivered the
[2:29:47] goods
[2:29:48] their faith stood not in word only but
[2:29:50] in demonstration and power
[2:29:52] miracles were the common order of the
[2:29:54] day
[2:29:57] they were baptized with the same holy
[2:29:59] ghost
[2:30:00] the same one that filled jesus and gave
[2:30:04] him power amen they were like their
[2:30:07] master
[2:30:08] they didn't have empty doctrines they
[2:30:11] didn't go and just pass out books and
[2:30:13] tapes
[2:30:13] but their doctrine was more than word
[2:30:16] only
[2:30:17] remember with power and with
[2:30:19] demonstration of the holy ghost
[2:30:21] it was it was that alpha church then
[2:30:24] then why
[2:30:25] should not this omega church be the same
[2:30:29] come on why would we be any different if
[2:30:32] that's what the book of acts
[2:30:34] did then then why should the people of
[2:30:37] the book
[2:30:38] be any different
[2:30:42] every demon and an angel is subject to
[2:30:44] the matchless name of jesus
[2:30:46] i mean believes that amen he gave us the
[2:30:49] power of authority to use his name
[2:30:52] amen and his name is mighty
[2:30:55] all of our all our authority is based on
[2:30:57] his finished work
[2:31:01] come on not what brother branham did but
[2:31:03] what jesus
[2:31:04] did at calvary amen
[2:31:07] and his authority is a based on his
[2:31:10] finished work but it's
[2:31:11] all encapsulated in his name
[2:31:16] and by giving us the legal use of his
[2:31:20] name
[2:31:21] now get this get this
[2:31:24] this is where we have come where they
[2:31:26] have not denied
[2:31:28] his name you got women today that they
[2:31:32] still want their
[2:31:33] their their maiden name they want to
[2:31:36] include
[2:31:36] they want you to know there's something
[2:31:39] different
[2:31:41] than their husband that's not the bride
[2:31:48] come on amen no you know
[2:31:51] he gave us his leg legal
[2:31:54] name to use
[2:31:59] see when i baptize
[2:32:02] and i baptize the aaron ogles me i don't
[2:32:05] baptize him
[2:32:07] in the name of ogles be jesus
[2:32:14] when i baptized joe adams i didn't
[2:32:17] baptize him in the name of
[2:32:19] adam's jesus
[2:32:24] when you're married to christ you forget
[2:32:28] your past identity
[2:32:30] [Applause]
[2:32:33] and you accept his identity
[2:32:36] and you say the all life is dead
[2:32:40] and i'm a new in christ and now the two
[2:32:43] have become one blessed
[2:32:45] under the same name i'm getting you
[2:32:48] somewhere
[2:32:49] so when you take on the name of jesus
[2:32:52] you have the same family name
[2:32:56] jesus had
[2:32:58] [Applause]
[2:33:01] hallelujah are you with me amen so
[2:33:05] all of our authority is enraft in his
[2:33:09] name by giving us the legal use of this
[2:33:12] name
[2:33:13] he has put omnipotence at our
[2:33:17] disposal in order
[2:33:20] that we can combat the satanic host
[2:33:23] that's right amen now here's how he
[2:33:26] defines our legal authority
[2:33:29] we shall cast out demons
[2:33:32] that means authority over demons in
[2:33:35] their relation to men
[2:33:37] cast them out of people's bodies break
[2:33:39] their power
[2:33:40] over those bodies over their minds over
[2:33:43] their spirits
[2:33:44] break their powers over over our
[2:33:47] meetings
[2:33:49] amen there's been many times i've had to
[2:33:51] preach and break the devil's power first
[2:33:55] amen break the power over our homes
[2:33:59] over our communities i want to send a
[2:34:02] word to you in south africa where
[2:34:04] rioting and looting and destruction has
[2:34:06] been going on
[2:34:07] and you're listening to me now hell
[2:34:09] cannot break out
[2:34:11] until the bride is lifted from the earth
[2:34:21] there were pillars of fire in acts
[2:34:22] chapter 2.
[2:34:24] there are pillars of fire in acts
[2:34:26] chapter
[2:34:27] in revelation chapter 10.
[2:34:30] so in the alpha church there there were
[2:34:33] pillars of fire
[2:34:34] in the omega church there are pillars of
[2:34:36] fire
[2:34:37] the anointing comes down a man upon the
[2:34:40] land and upon the sea
[2:34:43] what two beast powers arises
[2:34:46] one of them is the roman power
[2:34:49] and god how many can testify god gave us
[2:34:53] power
[2:34:53] over the roman doctrines he gave us
[2:34:57] power over her false trinity
[2:35:00] he gave us power over her naveena's and
[2:35:02] her saints
[2:35:03] and all the the trinity triune gods he
[2:35:06] gave us power
[2:35:07] he put our feet
[2:35:11] by giving us the pillar of fire each one
[2:35:15] of you
[2:35:15] have got your feet on the denominational
[2:35:18] spirit
[2:35:19] [Applause]
[2:35:20] amen and then this come on there's the
[2:35:23] land
[2:35:24] and the sea so that was out of the seed
[2:35:25] the multitude nation kinder tongues and
[2:35:27] people
[2:35:28] that's symbology in the bible the land
[2:35:31] is where no people come out
[2:35:32] america
[2:35:35] that ecumenical spirit we're all the
[2:35:38] same we're just this rainbow color
[2:35:40] we're just you know there's no black or
[2:35:42] white this is a pale horse you see
[2:35:44] you know you're neither male nor female
[2:35:46] and you can decide whatever you want to
[2:35:48] be
[2:35:48] because you know it's so mixed in the
[2:35:50] colors and it's such a deceiving spirit
[2:35:53] you know and it's it's neither black and
[2:35:55] it's not white and you can be anything
[2:35:56] you want to be
[2:35:57] and so here you are
[2:36:08] american spirit american idols
[2:36:12] feminism rising up in power
[2:36:15] until we got a woman who is vice
[2:36:17] president
[2:36:18] no doubt soon we'll be president
[2:36:22] i saw her rising up royal purples
[2:36:29] but i want to tell you that beast that
[2:36:32] rises up out of america
[2:36:35] cannot come full power
[2:36:41] until a bride is lifted up into a
[2:36:43] rapture
[2:36:46] because as long as she is here
[2:36:52] they are under our feet
[2:36:57] your very presence keeps the devil
[2:37:01] at bay and he cannot come in the full
[2:37:04] power until the bride is lifted up
[2:37:08] then satan comes down and has been a
[2:37:12] short time
[2:37:12] but as long as we are here he can't take
[2:37:16] over
[2:37:16] because there is a book of that church
[2:37:19] hallelujah because there is a people who
[2:37:22] know their god
[2:37:24] and who does exploit because their
[2:37:26] people
[2:37:28] feminine has no power over them amen
[2:37:32] political rams has no power over them
[2:37:35] and then homosexualism has no power over
[2:37:38] them
[2:37:38] and man the pale horse has no power over
[2:37:41] them
[2:37:42] amen why they are an eagle they're
[2:37:45] anointed
[2:37:46] with an eagle to rise up to fly up
[2:37:50] in the heavenlies where all
[2:37:53] things are possible for them to believe
[2:37:58] i declare to you today every devil is
[2:38:01] under your feet
[2:38:03] i declare you sicknesses under your feet
[2:38:06] sin is under your feet
[2:38:12] because you have been filled with a
[2:38:13] pillar of fire
[2:38:15] let the musicians come hallelujah
[2:38:19] hallelujah amen the book of acts
[2:38:22] continues
[2:38:25] we go forth in his name and
[2:38:28] nothing can stop us not even death
[2:38:32] because if death comes he will raise us
[2:38:35] up again
[2:38:36] [Applause]
[2:38:38] there is a new testament church
[2:38:41] she's rising she's not falling
[2:38:44] she's not a part of the fallen world
[2:38:47] she's a part
[2:38:50] of a rapture bride
[2:39:06] hallelujah our combat's not against
[2:39:10] flesh and blood but against
[2:39:11] principalities and powers
[2:39:13] trying to keep us from our place
[2:39:16] trying to convince you you're not worthy
[2:39:19] trying to convince you
[2:39:21] that you're powerless and helpless
[2:39:25] now you are the sons of god
[2:39:28] we are not powerless we're not helpless
[2:39:32] the devil is powerless he cannot take my
[2:39:36] wife's life
[2:39:41] he cannot take her life
[2:39:44] god holds that in his hands
[2:39:49] it's not even his decision whether she
[2:39:51] graduates
[2:39:53] or whether she continues days on the
[2:39:55] earth the devil has no part in her
[2:40:05] she didn't become eternal on april 11
[2:40:09] 1976 she always was eternal
[2:40:15] she could never die
[2:40:19] believe us now this yeah lord
[2:40:23] i believe that you are the resurrection
[2:40:26] of the life
