[22:39] tonight I pray that it will bless your
[22:41] heart and realize that the word is going
[22:43] around the world
[22:45] as I spoke with brother Buzz Bosey this
[22:48] week he's going to be going to
[22:51] back to the country there or Ethiopia
[22:55] and trying to spread the gospel there
[22:58] again and
[22:59] so we are responding we're helping with
[23:02] brother Wayne Lawson to sponsor him to
[23:04] go there and you know it's um a great
[23:07] work God gave the word and great was the
[23:10] company of those that published it
[23:13] so we all have a part to do and of
[23:16] course Sunday I want you to remember
[23:17] that we're going to be having our
[23:19] communion put washing after this Sunday
[23:22] morning service our fellowship meal
[23:24] together Sunday we're going to be taking
[23:26] an offering I want you to pray about
[23:29] given something for Missions and if you
[23:32] want to you just make it out to evening
[23:34] like Tabernacle and put down missions if
[23:37] you wanted to go to a specific place
[23:39] like Japan you can put Japanese missions
[23:42] that's fine we'll put it there in the
[23:44] designated place
[23:47] um you know if it's not a check and it's
[23:49] cash and you need um you need that we'll
[23:53] just put it in a tithe envelope and
[23:55] right there on the name missions
[23:57] and we'll know to put that in missions
[23:59] you need a tax receipt for that put your
[24:01] name on it
[24:02] so you know God is um giving us so much
[24:06] you know what what if this message
[24:08] let's say he had come to a foreign land
[24:12] let's say down in Peru and so it's um in
[24:16] Portuguese
[24:17] and it's way you know with a instead of
[24:20] a Kentucky preacher it's something you
[24:23] know way down in The Boondocks of a Peru
[24:26] where would it ever got out to the world
[24:29] but see God knew exactly who to entrust
[24:33] it with
[24:34] exactly what country to place that
[24:36] profit in in order that the gospel could
[24:39] go out into all the world
[24:43] and that gives us a responsibility if
[24:46] we're going to finish the Great

[24:50] it amen so we got to put our shoulder to
[24:53] the wheel and do our little part so as

[39:47] and speak to our hearts Lift us up I
[39:49] pray
[39:50] see the battle that we've been in Lord
[39:52] this week and we just asked the Lord
[39:54] that you would come and just bring a
[39:56] refresh into our spirit as the Lord and
[39:58] to our lives we pray
[40:01] Commit This Time To Your Hands For Your
[40:03] Glory
[40:04] in Jesus name
[40:08] his name let's turn to John chapter 1.
[40:11] number six
[40:19] and
[40:24] says here in John chapter 1 verse 6 says
[40:27] there was a man sent from God whose name
[40:30] was John
[40:32] and the same came for a witness to Bear
[40:35] witness of the light that all men
[40:37] through him might believe
[40:39] he was not that light but was sent to
[40:42] Bear witness of that light
[40:45] that was the True Light That lightest
[40:48] every man that cometh into the world
[40:52] read that last bit again that last verse
[40:54] that was the True Light which lighteth
[40:57] every man they cometh into the world
[41:01] amen we let you be seated
[41:05] like to speak to you this evening on
[41:07] reflecting the light
[41:09] amen
[41:11] reflecting his or reflection is the act
[41:14] of reflecting
[41:16] as in casting back a light or a heat or
[41:20] mirroring mirroring something giving
[41:22] back or showing an image
[41:25] and so when you are looking at a
[41:27] reflection You're Expecting like if
[41:30] you're looking into a mirror you're
[41:31] expecting that what is in what is
[41:34] looking at the mirror is reflected
[41:35] exactly back and what is what is being
[41:38] there before it and so you don't expect
[41:41] something different you don't expect
[41:44] um you know to be a different person or
[41:46] a different or you know if it's a man
[41:48] you don't expect it to be a woman
[41:49] standing there or whatever or if it's a
[41:52] dog you don't expect it to be a cat
[41:54] standing there you're expected to be a
[41:55] perfect reflection of what is sending
[41:58] the image
[41:59] and you know I believe I know that we're
[42:01] here in this time that we're living in
[42:03] we are reflecting something
[42:05] we see the world that is reflecting
[42:07] darkness and as kind of a paradox but
[42:10] they're reflecting Darkness to the point
[42:12] to where their lives are actually living
[42:14] or becoming what another realm is
[42:17] actually actually is and brother Bradham
[42:20] talked about that he says he said in in
[42:23] this realm he said here lives mortal
[42:25] beings each one is in this great
[42:28] conglomeration of gaiety of Blackness
[42:31] and darkness Mortals live in here now
[42:33] they're either influenced from this way
[42:36] or from that way from this way or from
[42:38] that way amen you cannot be a spiritual
[42:41] be in sinner or Saint without having an
[42:45] influence from the underworld or from
[42:47] the above world if your influenced from
[42:50] here then you're from above your
[42:53] Celestial body is waiting for you but if
[42:55] you're Wicked and hypocritical and
[42:57] indifferent your Celestial body is down
[43:00] here regardless of how much you think it
[43:03] is up here
[43:05] amen because the fruit that you bear
[43:07] before people proves where you're from
[43:10] so you're here what you are somewhere
[43:13] else
[43:14] you are here what you are somewhere else
[43:17] your life that you live here is just
[43:20] reflecting what your inheritance is when
[43:23] you leave here and so we are to be a
[43:26] reflection and we are reflecting
[43:28] something amen we know I believe that
[43:30] all of us are part of the body of Jesus
[43:32] Christ I I speak that in faith even
[43:35] though I know we're speaking to three
[43:36] kinds of Believers I still want to speak
[43:39] that that we're all part of the body of
[43:41] Jesus Christ maybe you're not quite
[43:43] reflecting that as of yet but I believe
[43:45] one day very soon you will be amen each
[43:48] one is different and therefore we have
[43:50] different things we bring to the body
[43:52] and not all of us are a reflection of
[43:54] his head or of his feet or of his of his
[43:57] hands but each part of us brings forth a
[44:00] part of the body it's a reflection of
[44:03] his body now some of the body of Christ
[44:05] in this service you know brother Brown
[44:07] says like this he said might like to sit
[44:09] real quiet you don't say much another
[44:11] one likes to be real happy another one
[44:13] does this or that but as long as we're
[44:16] saved by the blood of God born again
[44:19] Sons and Daughters of God we are a
[44:22] reflection of that body we are a
[44:24] reflection of that light amen he says
[44:27] look at this great body of Christ up
[44:29] here above the Earth shining down it is
[44:31] shining into another great body amen
[44:34] another great body that's on the earth
[44:36] and that body is a literal resurrected
[44:39] body of our Lord Jesus Christ that is
[44:42] there but it's now shining into his body
[44:45] spiritually speaking here upon this
[44:48] Earth amen shining he says now his body
[44:51] literally had eyes it had noses or had a
[44:54] nose it had ears it had a heart his body
[44:57] amen that literally was raised up from
[44:59] the grave is putting forth with each
[45:01] function of a spiritual body a spiritual
[45:04] body will also have eyes it also have
[45:07] noses nose it also have ears that also
[45:10] have a heart amen it'll also be a
[45:13] perfect reflection of what he was two
[45:16] thousand years ago amen I believe that
[45:18] that body is here again upon this Earth
[45:20] I believe there's a bride body of the
[45:23] Lord Jesus Christ that is upon this
[45:24] earth that is a reflection of what he
[45:27] was two thousand years ago amen it
[45:29] should be born of his bone flesh of his
[45:31] flesh life of his life power of his
[45:34] power what is it the same life that he
[45:36] get had she is reflecting back to him
[45:39] the same power that he puts out is the
[45:42] same power she's reflecting back to him
[45:45] amen the same Bones the same flesh
[45:47] everything has been reflected back to
[45:50] him and his power is on the Earth again
[45:53] and when his hands move there his hand
[45:56] moves here when his foot moves there his
[45:58] foot moves here amen we are a reflection
[46:01] of what he is he says when if we see the
[46:04] church come up shouting and rejoice him
[46:06] and then some sit and quiet and some
[46:09] crying and some doing this remember
[46:11] that's only the reaction of the real
[46:14] body
[46:16] come on now that's only the reaction of
[46:19] the real body the resurrected body of
[46:21] Jesus that's throwing the influence to
[46:24] that part of the body that's on the
[46:26] earth now so there's some that gets
[46:29] excited there's some that shouts there's
[46:31] some to Rejoice there's some that cries
[46:33] there's some that that's some that sits
[46:35] there quietly and absorbs it in what is
[46:38] it is a reflection of that body there
[46:41] hallelujah amen he said we believe that
[46:44] that body was Christ and Christ is the
[46:46] body and this is a reflection of that
[46:49] body then if the body here on Earth this
[46:51] Earthly body we have now it begins to
[46:54] say well the days of Miracles are passed
[46:56] then that part of Christ is dead
[47:00] come on now that part of Christ is dead
[47:03] it isn't living it doesn't reflect no
[47:06] more of his power then this part of the
[47:08] body of Christ isn't living for if it's
[47:10] living it's moving it's making every
[47:13] reflection of its moving to the church
[47:16] on Earth so if he still has the power to
[47:19] heal then this body is reflecting that
[47:21] power to heal if he still has the power
[47:24] to save then this body is reflecting
[47:27] that power that it was in that body to
[47:29] say because it is all a perfect
[47:31] reflection of his body he said now that
[47:34] everything on Earth is a reflection of
[47:36] what's going on somewhere else
[47:40] so if you see the world getting bad well
[47:43] how do you think hell is it this evening
[47:46] amen things are getting worse and worse
[47:49] and hell is opening up his mouth and and
[47:52] you know and you say well the devil's
[47:54] turning loose on us well you know one
[47:56] thing that gives me great courage and
[47:57] I've leaned on many times in the thought
[47:59] of the devil turning loose he said when
[48:01] all hell turns loose all Heaven's going
[48:04] to turn loose with it so if all hell has
[48:07] been against you and and we can see hell
[48:09] being reflected here upon Earth then we
[48:12] can also say that heaven has turned
[48:14] loose and Heaven is reflecting his power
[48:16] in a body Heaven is reflecting his power
[48:20] in your life and in my life what is
[48:23] happening somewhere else is happening
[48:25] right here
[48:27] we are reflection amen what is going on
[48:30] he said so because if this Earthly body
[48:32] be dissolved we have one waiting for us
[48:35] amen just what you're somewhere else is
[48:38] what you are here
[48:41] come on now
[48:42] amen well if you're a hypocrite here
[48:44] you're a hypocrite somewhere else
[48:47] amen if you're a sinner here you're a
[48:49] sinner somewhere else but if you're
[48:51] saved bought child of the Living God
[48:54] Amen that's what you are somewhere else
[48:56] amen you you're if you and your life
[48:59] isn't just correct here then your
[49:01] spiritual body in another place is not
[49:04] correct yet
[49:06] amen if you got all your members
[49:08] submissive to God then you are
[49:10] reflecting somewhere else he says you
[49:13] know when you was a boy you wanted to
[49:15] wait long enough you couldn't hardly
[49:16] wait till you could put on Long trousers
[49:18] 21 years old Be Your Own Boss you wanted
[49:21] to get married you want to pay for your
[49:23] home and then to have children to raise
[49:25] and now you're getting old and gray
[49:27] still you're not satisfied he said see
[49:30] it's your reflection this is a negative
[49:33] but there is a positive just on the
[49:36] other side
[49:37] Hallelujah so if there's a place in your
[49:40] heart Desiring to be perfect there's a
[49:43] bound to be a Perfection somewhere you
[49:46] can reach
[49:47] Hallelujah if there's a desire in your
[49:50] heart to be saved then there's a
[49:52] Salvation you can receive
[49:55] if there's a desire in your heart to be
[49:57] healed then there's a healing you can't
[49:59] obtain
[50:01] hallelujah amen yes David said when the
[50:05] Deep call us to the Deep there's a deep
[50:07] to respond before there could be a deep
[50:09] to call there had to be a deep Fort to
[50:11] call from
[50:13] amen so what is it what if what is
[50:16] causing us to react the way we are it's
[50:19] our Heavenly home
[50:21] it's a pull from another dementia it's a
[50:24] light that is shining down upon us amen
[50:26] and we're reflecting that sign he said
[50:28] when the Sun is up let me go back and
[50:30] back up a little bit he says if this
[50:32] desire is so to be perfect where you'll
[50:35] never get old where you never get
[50:37] gray-headed where you'll always be young
[50:39] where you're always be at your best
[50:41] where you'll never be sick where you'll
[50:44] never have sorrow where you'll never
[50:46] have fear well if you so desire that it
[50:49] has to be somewhere
[50:51] or you couldn't have a desire for it
[50:54] everything is a reflection
[50:59] that song sings there is a land I'm
[51:02] homesick for though I've never seen it
[51:05] before
[51:06] amen oh Hallelujah
[51:09] see when the Sun is up now it's bright
[51:12] and shiny Lord knows it's bright and
[51:14] shiny today the sun will go down this
[51:17] evening but there will be a moon that
[51:20] will reflect the light
[51:22] now this Moon does not have its own
[51:24] light but it has it's a reflection of a
[51:27] light
[51:28] amen now it's not the moon it's not even
[51:31] Moon we call it look at the Moonlight
[51:33] it's not Moonlight it's actually
[51:35] sunlight on the moon amen amen but it's
[51:39] the moon reflection of the light that is
[51:41] shining from another round it's the sun
[51:44] shining to the moon and then it's
[51:46] reflecting to the Earth in other words
[51:48] the Moon is the bride the sun is the Son
[51:51] of God and while the sun is gone the
[51:54] Moon is reflecting of his light it is
[51:57] reflecting to a dark World the light of
[52:00] a living God it is reflecting to the
[52:03] dark world that Jesus still saves he
[52:06] still heals he still delivers just as he
[52:09] did in the sun his soul still does still
[52:12] to yet today he's still the same
[52:14] yesterday today and forever
[52:17] and he put a testimony up there it's
[52:20] actually when you see it at night it is
[52:22] a reflection of you
[52:25] God put you in the skies before you ever
[52:28] came
[52:30] my God you look at it just a moon and
[52:33] sometimes it's so it's very beautiful
[52:35] and very bold and then there's little
[52:37] slivers but it's all the same Moon and
[52:40] it's reflecting the same light it never
[52:42] gives light of its own it never has the
[52:45] ability to manufacture anything on its
[52:47] own it can only do as it is shined upon
[52:52] hallelujah amen just as you you cannot
[52:55] manufacture this Christian Life on your
[52:57] own you can't live the Christian Life on
[53:00] your own you have no ability on your own
[53:02] you're nothing but rotten speaking human
[53:04] flesh but one day the Son of God rose up
[53:08] in your life and it began to shine upon
[53:10] you
[53:12] and you're now as he is shining upon you
[53:15] and he illuminated every fiber of your
[53:17] body it is shining now to a dark Dying
[53:20] World
[53:21] and scream it out Jesus still saves
[53:24] Jesus still heals he still delivers he
[53:27] still sets free
[53:32] Hallelujah
[53:34] no much no matter how much the devil
[53:36] wants to say and he wants to braise up
[53:38] cancer in our face There's a Moon that's
[53:40] shining right over there
[53:43] and we can constantly point to that Moon
[53:46] and say devil my God still heals cancer
[53:50] that moon is shining amen shining out of
[53:54] light amen no matter how much the devil
[53:56] wants to say that your sons are too far
[53:59] gone and there's no hope for them and
[54:01] it's impossible for God to read There's
[54:03] a Moon that's shining right over there
[54:05] and we can point to it and show the Dark
[54:08] World God still saves it doesn't matter
[54:12] how far they're called it doesn't matter
[54:14] how far it's been and how long they've
[54:17] been out of the house of God there's a
[54:18] moon up
[54:20] [Applause]
[54:21] and there's a light that is shining
[54:23] reflecting it out to a dark world
[54:26] the moon sometimes is so pretty and
[54:29] bright
[54:30] but what does make it sometimes when the
[54:32] moon isn't pretty and bright there's a
[54:34] lot of storm clouds over it
[54:37] but that doesn't mean there ain't still
[54:40] light there
[54:43] amen there's a lot of you that's been
[54:45] through a lot of storms
[54:47] been a lot of clouds over you a lot of a
[54:49] lot of Darkness around you but that
[54:52] doesn't mean the sun is still not
[54:54] reflecting through you
[54:57] amen amen you know sometimes you go
[55:00] through things as Christians
[55:02] amen it ain't always sunshine and roses
[55:04] and and then pretty flowers and
[55:07] beautiful mountaintops no you go through
[55:09] some Dark Places sometimes but just
[55:12] because you're in a dark place does not
[55:13] mean the sun is still not shining upon
[55:16] you it just does not does not mean that
[55:19] the sun is not still illuminate in your
[55:22] life and orchestrating your life and
[55:25] moving upon you just because the clouds
[55:27] there does not mean the sun is still not
[55:30] in power just because a cloud of
[55:32] awareness or our cloud of dreariness or
[55:35] our cloud of frustration whatever it is
[55:37] has been sitting upon you that does not
[55:40] mean the sun is not still shining upon
[55:42] you but there's still light upon you
[55:48] because the sun is still up
[55:51] and the devil can do all he wants to but
[55:53] he can't put it out
[55:55] amen
[55:59] you know if there was no light Sun Moon
[56:02] nothing at all Sun wasn't shining
[56:04] somewhere why the darkness would be so
[56:07] dark
[56:08] so you couldn't even see your hand
[56:10] before your face
[56:11] you know I've been in those places down
[56:13] in the cavern and it's not a cool place
[56:15] I don't like that where you move your
[56:17] hand you can't even see it you can't
[56:19] even see a
[56:21] you can feel a little something but you
[56:22] can't even see it just a minute movement
[56:25] there's nothing there it's a dark place
[56:27] to be it been
[56:29] and sometimes you can get in those kind
[56:31] of places and it seems so dark
[56:34] it seems so lonely and it seems like
[56:37] nobody cares but the sun is still
[56:40] Shining
[56:42] there is but there is a sun
[56:45] there is the clouds will move back again
[56:49] and you'll see a little reflection of a
[56:51] moon somewhere and what what that's when
[56:54] the trouble is going on in the church
[56:55] and things storm clouds and contentions
[56:57] and indifference in the churches than
[56:59] the storm clouds it's hard to get
[57:01] through it's hard to press through but
[57:03] the sun is still Shining
[57:05] it's still moving amen the moon doesn't
[57:09] quit existing
[57:11] Hallelujah the moon doesn't quit
[57:13] existing the sun doesn't quit existing
[57:16] it's still there
[57:21] and someday when Jesus comes
[57:24] the church WIll coincide and coordinate
[57:27] because it's the same power of God
[57:29] coming out of the out of Christ and to
[57:31] the church and it's all coordinating
[57:33] together at that day you'll know I'm in
[57:36] the father and the father and me and I
[57:39] and you
[57:41] but in the beginning God provided a moon
[57:43] to give a lesser light
[57:48] another another place he said the moon
[57:49] and the sun are perfectly husband and
[57:52] wife
[57:54] when the Sun goes down it goes beyond
[57:56] Way Beyond the world and you can't see
[57:58] it's glimmer no more and there's nothing
[58:00] but Darkness up comes the Moon it
[58:03] reflects the light to the moon and the
[58:06] moon gives a lesser light by night
[58:09] just as Jesus when he was here on the
[58:11] earth he went away he went back up into
[58:14] the heavens but it reflects back the
[58:17] holy ghost in the church
[58:19] amen which is the light in his place
[58:22] today
[58:23] come on now which is the light in his
[58:26] place today remember the moon didn't
[58:29] give light at all to herself the moon
[58:30] doesn't that's still the sunlight that's
[58:33] the way it is today it's not the church
[58:35] it's the Holy Ghost on the church
[58:39] hallelujah it's just as the Morning Star
[58:41] he said I'd go out tonight and would say
[58:43] upgrade Morning Star will be shining the
[58:46] skies a little before day in the morning
[58:48] it's a great morning story what makes
[58:50] you shine what makes all your stars
[58:52] shine well if you could speak back to me
[58:54] so brother Branham it's not me shining
[58:57] it's the sun shining on me that's What
[59:00] Makes Me Shine somebody said to me not
[59:02] long ago don't you think those people
[59:04] that holler amen and shout hallelujah
[59:06] all like that in a meeting don't you
[59:08] think they're just getting a little
[59:09] excited I said no they're Shining
[59:13] that's right it's not me that's shining
[59:16] it's not you that's China it's God
[59:18] shining on us and the Holy Spirit given
[59:21] the new birth
[59:24] and as a Morning Star is reflecting the
[59:27] light of the absent Christ by his power
[59:29] and demonstration the church sends forth
[59:32] the light in this dark time sometimes
[59:34] daylight will come and the sun over
[59:36] someday soon daylight will come and the
[59:38] son of righteousness will arise with
[59:40] healing in his wings this Mortal will
[59:43] take on immortality and we'll see him as
[59:45] he is made like his own glorious body
[59:48] there will never be no more sick
[59:52] there will never be no harm or heartache
[59:55] there'll never be no more
[59:56] disappointments
[59:57] [Music]
[1:00:01] but the son of righteousness will be the
[1:00:05] light
[1:00:09] amen
[1:00:11] but even there
[1:00:14] will still reflect his light
[1:00:18] say God is like a big great great big
[1:00:21] diamond
[1:00:22] that diamond has been cut in such a way
[1:00:24] in a true cut diamond it reflects many
[1:00:27] rays of light
[1:00:29] and when we see the church with so many
[1:00:31] different gifts of the Spirit and
[1:00:34] it's only the Reflection off the real
[1:00:38] diamond
[1:00:39] one may seem like a little peculiar to
[1:00:42] the other
[1:00:43] but there's the way the diamond reflects
[1:00:45] the light
[1:00:48] amen we don't all have to be the same
[1:00:51] kind of light
[1:00:53] but we have to reflect the same light
[1:00:57] amen a true cut diamond reflects many
[1:01:01] rays of light
[1:01:04] that's why you've been here brother
[1:01:06] brother Aaron different ones priests
[1:01:08] brother Tim amen we're not trying to say
[1:01:10] everybody's got to be the certain ray of
[1:01:12] light that shouts all the time or Dances
[1:01:16] all the time but if that's the ray that
[1:01:19] you are and you're quenching that
[1:01:23] amen well that's not just who I am is it
[1:01:26] or is it not you need to allow God to be
[1:01:28] free on however he wants to use you
[1:01:30] that's the point be free on how God
[1:01:33] wants to reflect through you
[1:01:38] because there's many different lights
[1:01:40] but it's all one light
[1:01:43] have many different colors
[1:01:45] have many different looks
[1:01:48] it'd be pretty boring if we all walked
[1:01:50] in front of a mirror and we all looked
[1:01:52] the same
[1:01:55] that'd be pretty weird
[1:01:58] a lot weirder than than anything else I
[1:02:01] can think of
[1:02:03] that'd be really weird
[1:02:06] all of us men we walked before the a
[1:02:09] mirror here and we all looked exactly
[1:02:11] the same
[1:02:15] all of us and all the ladies here walk
[1:02:17] before a mirror and you'll all look
[1:02:19] exactly the same
[1:02:21] that ain't the way a diet that's not
[1:02:23] what the way this diamond created you
[1:02:25] he wanted short people
[1:02:28] he wanted tall people he wanted in
[1:02:31] between people
[1:02:33] we're going to stay off the weight
[1:02:37] he wanted all kinds
[1:02:40] he didn't want us to all be just like
[1:02:43] one little robot walking around saying
[1:02:45] the same thing doing the same things
[1:02:47] making the same motions
[1:02:50] all at the same time say Amen all at the
[1:02:53] same time do this no that's not what he
[1:02:54] wanted he wanted many different lights
[1:02:57] [Applause]
[1:03:00] he wanted a bouquet of flowers
[1:03:10] God does it that way
[1:03:12] he reflects a gift to the in the church
[1:03:15] one is and as he said in the Bible one
[1:03:18] has a gift of knowledge other has a gift
[1:03:20] of tongues one has the gift of something
[1:03:22] else it's God reflecting these lights
[1:03:30] so you know how you know how you keep
[1:03:32] that from happening you cover it up
[1:03:34] or you take it out
[1:03:36] I know God wants all of his lights to
[1:03:38] shine
[1:03:40] amen he wants it all because it's a
[1:03:43] reflection of himself it's God
[1:03:45] reflecting these lights and they are the
[1:03:48] lights that's gathered in one person
[1:03:50] almighty God
[1:03:55] you know one night he said he was
[1:03:57] holding a meeting in Milltown Baptist
[1:03:58] Church
[1:03:59] he said I was a pastor down there for
[1:04:01] some time and I was coming home with old
[1:04:03] friend of mine stayed all night
[1:04:05] and I noticed when I'd come by a certain
[1:04:08] place
[1:04:09] and the cedar Bush and was his
[1:04:11] Nightingale all night long he would sing
[1:04:14] to the top of his voice just as loud as
[1:04:17] he could sing
[1:04:18] how well I could understand why the
[1:04:20] birds sing when it's daylight
[1:04:23] but this this bird was singing to the
[1:04:25] lie as top of his voice his voice as
[1:04:28] loud as he could get at night
[1:04:31] as I can imagine the sunlight like
[1:04:33] bathing on birds in the daylight and
[1:04:35] that Sun Ray warming them from a cold
[1:04:37] night or or a wet you know stormy night
[1:04:40] and it makes them sing but what makes a
[1:04:43] bird sing at night
[1:04:44] he said so I got me a book and I began
[1:04:46] to read up on the old Nightingale and I
[1:04:49] come to find out that the Nightingale
[1:04:51] what makes him sing is he watches the
[1:04:53] skies and every time he can look and see
[1:04:56] the clouds begin to move back and see
[1:04:59] one star
[1:05:00] one ray of light he begins to scream and
[1:05:05] sing to the top of his voice
[1:05:08] because he knows the sun is shining
[1:05:12] somewhere
[1:05:14] and he's speaking back to the Earth that
[1:05:17] the sun is shining somewhere isn't that
[1:05:21] amazing that God would create a bird to
[1:05:23] testify in the darkness amen when it's
[1:05:26] dark all around and he's looking at the
[1:05:28] skies and he sees one little glimmer of
[1:05:30] life and he starts singing to the top of
[1:05:32] his voice
[1:05:34] and he's letting you know God's still
[1:05:36] God the sun's still shining it might be
[1:05:39] on the other side of the Earth right now
[1:05:41] but it's still Shining
[1:05:44] oh Hallelujah I wonder how many
[1:05:46] Nightingales we have in this building
[1:05:48] tonight that maybe it's been Darkness
[1:05:58] a star and you just want to shout and
[1:06:00] say the Sun is up
[1:06:05] Hallelujah that Sun is up and God is
[1:06:09] moving among his children
[1:06:14] brothers and sisters long it's down in
[1:06:17] my heart through the black clouds of

[1:11:25] where testimonies are and the powers of
[1:11:27] God Among Us isn't it it isn't the

[1:12:35] going to do that you take your Camp Off
[1:12:39] amen and let the gusher of the Holy
[1:12:41] Ghost begin to pour down and let it
[1:12:44] begin to move and let it begin to touch
[1:12:46] and let it begin to shine upon somebody
[1:12:48] and let it then begin to reflect
[1:12:51] something that's going on he said you
[1:12:53] notice in the morning he said I watched
[1:12:55] it many times I see the Dew fall at
[1:12:58] night look out here and see the dewfall
[1:13:00] every time when the sun comes up did you
[1:13:03] notice how happy the little Dew Drop was
[1:13:08] maybe some of you I can get up early
[1:13:10] enough
[1:13:11] I get up early enough to see Dew drops
[1:13:13] come on somebody
[1:13:15] hey man how many gets up early enough to
[1:13:17] see Dew drops how many knows what a dew
[1:13:20] drop is
[1:13:21] it's not a drink
[1:13:24] that's a Sun Drop I think talking about
[1:13:26] a dew drop it's on a blade of grass a
[1:13:28] little bit of tinkle of a water just
[1:13:31] twinkling a little bit
[1:13:34] fell out of the heavens
[1:13:36] landed down there on some grass
[1:13:39] way down deep
[1:13:42] sometimes it gets trumped on
[1:13:44] sometimes it gets stepped on
[1:13:46] sometimes it gets mowed under
[1:13:49] but it's still there
[1:13:51] and there's still wanting something
[1:13:55] and this little Dew Drop is laying there
[1:13:57] waiting for something
[1:13:58] and he said if you watch it when the sun
[1:14:00] comes up
[1:14:02] how happy a little Dew Drop can get
[1:14:08] can you imagine when the Holy Ghost
[1:14:11] comes into our church service how happy
[1:14:14] a Son of God can get
[1:14:19] amen he begins to Sparkle and he begins
[1:14:23] to shine and he begins to Sparkle and he
[1:14:26] begins to shine he said I was asking one
[1:14:28] one morning talking to Nature apparently
[1:14:30] he did that a lot
[1:14:32] talking to Nature he said I asked and
[1:14:35] said what makes you Sparkle a little
[1:14:36] dewdrop and it seemed like something in
[1:14:39] that way spoke back to me and said you
[1:14:41] know last night I was up there
[1:14:45] and now this morning the sun is Rose and
[1:14:49] I know I'm about to go back to where I
[1:14:51] came from
[1:14:55] Hallelujah and I'm about to leave this
[1:14:57] old hot ass
[1:14:59] and all the problems and all the
[1:15:02] struggle and that's why I'm happy
[1:15:04] because the sun is shining on me and the
[1:15:07] sun is shining and it's pulling me into
[1:15:09] another Realm
[1:15:12] oh Hallelujah that's exactly what
[1:15:14] happens to a child of God when the son
[1:15:17] of righteousness arises in one of our
[1:15:19] services and the light of God comes in
[1:15:21] our midst and begins to shine on
[1:15:24] somebody it's beginning to Shimmer a
[1:15:25] little bit get a little happy a little
[1:15:27] bit maybe tears flow off their face
[1:15:29] their hands come up what is it they know
[1:15:32] they came from up there
[1:15:35] and they may they're going back to their
[1:15:38] place and there's a God a light that is
[1:15:41] shining upon them to draw them into
[1:15:43] Heavenly places
[1:15:53] he said that thing that little dewdrop
[1:15:55] says I once was up there
[1:15:58] and I'm happy because the sun is shining
[1:16:01] on me
[1:16:02] and when the Sun Shines on me
[1:16:04] it's drawing me right back to where I
[1:16:07] was
[1:16:09] and he said that's exactly right dewdrop
[1:16:12] the reason you can do that shine and
[1:16:16] Sparkle is because you've got an
[1:16:18] experience
[1:16:24] you got an experience you was up there
[1:16:28] once
[1:16:30] he said I think a lot about that a man
[1:16:33] that's ever been born again took out of
[1:16:36] the life out of this life into the realm
[1:16:40] of the blessings and the glory one of
[1:16:42] these days the son of righteousness will
[1:16:44] shine across the Earth and those with
[1:16:46] that kind of experience
[1:16:49] we'll be caught up to meet him in the
[1:16:52] air up there where they have have been
[1:16:55] in the Realms of glory and lost
[1:16:56] themselves many times before he said all
[1:16:59] that's around them they don't care who's
[1:17:01] around it they once they've been up
[1:17:03] there and when they get in that kind of
[1:17:05] condition with the anointing of the
[1:17:07] spirit Fallen the master Spirit Jesus
[1:17:10] Christ will come day one day again and
[1:17:13] claim you out of here into Glory
[1:17:19] do you understand what he's saying there
[1:17:22] actually in a service
[1:17:25] you being drawn up into Heavenly places
[1:17:27] and leaving your thoughts of tomorrow
[1:17:31] and leaving
[1:17:32] those that are around you
[1:17:35] and leaving and getting so lost
[1:17:38] to you don't even care no more
[1:17:42] it's a reflection
[1:17:44] that one day he's going to come
[1:17:47] and he's going to not just pull you into
[1:17:49] a realm and you go up and you and you
[1:17:52] come into that place and you have to
[1:17:54] walk back in this old world again and
[1:17:57] you come up and you come back down but
[1:17:59] one day this this is a reflection
[1:18:05] how you are reacting when he comes
[1:18:09] is a reflection of how you will react
[1:18:11] when he comes
[1:18:21] it's reflecting the light
[1:18:24] now you heard me before I didn't say you
[1:18:26] all had to be dancing
[1:18:28] I didn't say your halter had to be but
[1:18:30] you had to be receiving him when he came
[1:18:35] and acknowledging him when he comes
[1:18:39] it is reflection of that day
[1:18:44] when the change is sweeping over bodies
[1:18:47] and you don't react
[1:18:51] because you didn't change
[1:18:56] it blew my mind when I was thinking
[1:18:58] about this today
[1:19:02] God says another place he says did you
[1:19:04] ever go out on a morning after a dark
[1:19:07] dismal night
[1:19:08] look hanging on the clothes wire look
[1:19:10] hanging on the glass grass blades
[1:19:12] hanging on a leaf a little dewdrop
[1:19:15] so miserable looking
[1:19:17] quivering Chilly Winds shaking them
[1:19:21] but just let the sun start to rise
[1:19:24] watch how they shine they glisten you
[1:19:27] know they were once in the sky
[1:19:30] and the going away of the sun brought
[1:19:32] them down but they had been up there
[1:19:36] they had an experience they are a
[1:19:39] witness that there's an atmosphere to
[1:19:41] live above this Earth
[1:19:43] and as soon as the sun is the one that
[1:19:46] draws the duvet into the sky again and
[1:19:48] once they've been up now they're down
[1:19:50] but they see the sunrise and they know
[1:19:53] they're going back up again
[1:19:55] Hallelujah
[1:20:02] what nature can teach us
[1:20:04] how God would put it in his in his write
[1:20:07] it in the Bible of nature
[1:20:09] and reflect us
[1:20:12] as humans
[1:20:14] many times we pass right by it
[1:20:17] and don't even see that's a reflection
[1:20:19] of me
[1:20:20] that bird singing is a reflection of me
[1:20:23] that Dew drops of reflection of me
[1:20:26] those stars are a reflection of me
[1:20:29] amen that was his first Bible
[1:20:32] he wrote Us in the heavens
[1:20:34] amen you know okay Lord let's read about
[1:20:37] it Psalms 8 and verse 1 oh Lord our Lord
[1:20:39] how excellent is thy name and all the
[1:20:41] Earth who has set thy Glory above the
[1:20:44] heavens out of the mouth of babes and
[1:20:46] succulents have thou ordained strength
[1:20:48] because of thine enemies that thou might
[1:20:50] have steal the enemy and the Avenger and
[1:20:53] when I consider thy heavens and the
[1:20:56] works of thy fingers the moon and the
[1:21:00] stars which thou Hast ordained
[1:21:05] which thou Hast ordained in the next
[1:21:07] verse what is man
[1:21:10] that thou art mindful of him
[1:21:13] I got to looking at this word ordained
[1:21:15] those stars in other words are fixed
[1:21:17] they are determined they are directed by
[1:21:20] God and can never be put out
[1:21:23] they are established amen they are
[1:21:27] prepared for and provided for and
[1:21:30] furnished amen they are arranged in
[1:21:33] order
[1:21:34] amen they are established there they're
[1:21:36] fiction of certain place they cannot be
[1:21:38] moved
[1:21:42] and this is what he's saying what is man
[1:21:44] that thou art mindful of him and the son
[1:21:47] of man that thou visit for thou has made
[1:21:49] him a little lower the Angels crowning
[1:21:51] with Glory and Honor that's made him to
[1:21:53] have dominion over the work of thy hands
[1:21:55] thou has put all things under his feet
[1:22:00] he points to the stars and says what is
[1:22:03] man
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:12] many people want to be a star and they
[1:22:15] aspire to be Stars what the world calls

[1:23:13] Brown talked about these seven lights
[1:23:15] that are in the hands of God he said
[1:23:16] they're not Delight they don't have
[1:23:18] lights of their own they're reflecting
[1:23:20] the light
[1:23:22] but they're held in the cradle and
[1:23:24] here's Satan comes along right at the
[1:23:26] place where the prophet of God would
[1:23:27] come and stand and God would come down
[1:23:29] the pillar of fire would come down and
[1:23:31] discern the hearts Satan says you know
[1:23:33] what I got my stars too

[1:25:16] amen let's read about it right here Amen
[1:25:20] in Job chapter 38 and verse 1 then the
[1:25:24] Lord answered job out of a whirlwind
[1:25:27] you know oh job
[1:25:29] he was in a bad Strait right about this
[1:25:31] moment
[1:25:32] he had been you know he'd been through a
[1:25:35] lot of things I don't know if you've
[1:25:36] heard about Joe's job's life but he he
[1:25:38] went to a few difficult days
[1:25:42] yeah it really
[1:25:44] probably worse than all of us put
[1:25:45] together
[1:25:47] what we ever been through in our life
[1:25:50] and here here he is and then you know he
[1:25:53] gets these three comforters to come they
[1:25:55] come to comfort him I was listening to
[1:25:57] him here while listening to him talk a
[1:25:59] while back and they were constantly
[1:26:00] needling him and asking him well surely
