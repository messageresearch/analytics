[42:37] mercy father in the name of
[42:40] Jesus as every heart Lord reaches out to
[42:43] you as today we move out of this

[42:49] Realms oh God where angels are
[42:53] present where the Holy Spirit
[42:57] predominates to where it's only perfect
[43:01] love and there before the throne of
[43:04] grace we
[43:05] come and we come to find help in our
[43:09] time of need and Lord we find oursel
[43:12] needy

[43:35] overcome but
[43:37] Lord we're not depending on our Humanity
[43:40] this
[43:41] morning therefore we are not approaching
[43:44] your throne of grace as humans but as

[47:14] resist it in the name of Jesus and we
[47:16] claim the promise for every believer
[47:19] right now in jesus' name amen and amen

[47:24] worship God and thank him right now
[47:27] thank him right now thank you Lord in
[47:29] advance that our prayers have been

[47:38] you're dealing with Souls as only you
[47:40] can you're speaking to them in ways we
[47:43] could not you're knocking on hearts and
[47:46] dealing with lives you're healing bodies
[47:49] right now Lord the Holy Spirit going
[47:51] forth right now healing bodies Lord we
[47:54] know of your power of your Resurrection
[47:57] ction and we ask that it'll work among
[47:59] us today as only you can do in Jesus
[48:04] name amen and amen amen God bless you
[48:09] God bless you thank you for being here
[48:11] today let's turn to the word of God as
[48:14] we look to the word there's many things
[48:17] that are laying here in the scripture
[48:19] and sometimes we just can't no way get
[48:23] to them allall and even sometimes even
[48:25] complete full thought so we're going to
[48:30] actually pick on up on what I preached
[48:31] on last Sunday some more things that I
[48:34] want to speak from there as I speak of
[48:37] the living bride the final
[48:40] Stones amen and to if you'll turn with
[48:43] me to Ephesians 5 we'll read from verse
[48:47] 25 and while you're reading from there I
[48:50] want you to remember our theme on the
[48:53] mountain movers of who art thou oh great
[48:55] Mountain Thou shalt become a plain and
[48:59] The Headstone shall be brought forth
[49:01] with shoutings crying Grace Grace to it
[49:04] so Ephesians chap 5 and verse 25 I
[49:08] wanted to show you um a mountain and if
[49:12] we'll look here in this verse it says
[49:14] husband loves your wives even as Christ
[49:17] also loved the church and gave himself
[49:19] for it that he might sanctify it and
[49:22] cleanse it with the washing of Water by
[49:25] the word
[49:27] verse 27 that he might present it to
[49:30] himself and here's the mountain a
[49:33] glorious church not having spot or
[49:37] wrinkle or any such thing but it that it
[49:40] should be holy and without
[49:44] blemish and then last Sunday I showed
[49:48] you another Capstone which we know that
[49:50] Jesus has been building a church for
[49:52] Seven Ages and the majority of that
[49:55] church has already been made up they're
[49:58] resting as part of that building they're
[50:00] described in the Bible as the dead in
[50:04] Christ and yet without us they're not
[50:09] finished they're not
[50:11] complete so there is yet to be the
[50:14] finishing Stone of people alive and
[50:16] remain and she will be the Capstone
[50:19] Church of the ages who will perfectly
[50:23] match Christ who's the head of all and
[50:28] so 1 Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord
[50:31] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[50:35] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[50:38] and with the Trump of God and the dead
[50:40] in Christ shall rise first and then we
[50:44] which are alive and remain shall be
[50:46] caught up together with them in the
[50:49] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[50:53] so shall we ever be with the Lord L amen
[50:57] God bless you you can be
[51:03] seated the Capstone that we are speaking
[51:06] about
[51:07] today of course um it represents that
[51:11] final piece that brings the structure
[51:14] together and in in a large picture of it
[51:18] it signifies Jesus as the ultimate
[51:21] fulfillment of God's great plan but let
[51:25] us not think think of Jesus as only in
[51:29] the masculine
[51:31] form because his bride is Miss Jesus and
[51:35] will be the ultimate fulfillment of all
[51:38] the scriptures that spoke of her and we
[51:41] ask of ourselves this morning how will
[51:44] he do this you know this is an
[51:46] insurmountable Mountain to have to have
[51:50] as he said a glorious church not having
[51:53] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[51:56] holy and without blemish how is this
[51:59] even possible we we know ourselves in
[52:02] the frailness of our own
[52:04] humanity and we we know that this is a
[52:07] DA daunting task because even the church
[52:11] has struggled with imperfections for two
[52:15] millenniums and where she was defiled
[52:18] with false doctrines and with Creeds of
[52:20] men and I know to bring forth this bride
[52:25] to perfection it will be with great
[52:28] shoutings of Grace Grace it certainly
[52:31] will be the favor of God but not only
[52:35] that but through the Dark Ages that we
[52:37] know this church has had its struggles
[52:40] it has went to down to the ground like a
[52:43] seed and it decayed and it rotted as it
[52:46] were and yes it
[52:49] died and just as there was the death of
[52:51] Christ on a Roman Tree so did his bride
[52:54] the church die on Roman Tree as brother
[52:58] Brandon would bring this out in
[53:01] restoration of the Bride tree he said
[53:02] the Roman caterpillar started eating on
[53:05] that bride tree until it took it Plum to
[53:08] the roots and the same Roman Tree what
[53:11] kind of tree did did did cut down did
[53:15] did cut Christ down and the congregation
[53:18] says Roman what kind of tree that cut
[53:21] Christ bride down Roman how by
[53:24] substituting something besides the word
[53:28] so it has been for the past ages that
[53:31] she has been sealed and intuned with the
[53:34] Creeds of man a Roman seal um of Trinity
[53:39] of of the worship of Mary of all myriads
[53:43] of man's Traditions has sealed her in
[53:47] the in the tombs of religion and Satan
[53:51] is is is like the Romans were they were
[53:54] going to make sure that Jesus did not
[53:57] raise from the dead and that his body
[53:59] would never leave the tomb and so Satan
[54:03] has done the same thing down to the ages
[54:06] he's he sealed her behind the doors of
[54:09] Creeds and dogmas and trying to bring
[54:13] and put put Roman seals upon her to try
[54:16] to hold her back and so for the to bring
[54:19] forth the bride age or bride time there
[54:23] has to be a
[54:25] resurrection so that even as there was a
[54:28] resurrection of the groom so there must
[54:31] be a resurrection of the Bride out of
[54:34] the tombs of religion for did not Jesus
[54:37] say of them in Matthew 23: 27 you're
[54:41] like white wash tombs painted white in
[54:45] other words you're like a burial Vault
[54:48] you're like a A melum or um a beautiful
[54:52] tomb that looks beautiful on the outside
[54:55] but on the inside what do you find
[54:57] inside that tomb you find um full of
[55:00] dead men's bones and everything
[55:03] unclean and of course this is the the
[55:06] the state that he found the religious
[55:09] system in in his day and this is the
[55:13] status of the religious systems of today
[55:17] tombs of man that have that has tried to
[55:20] hold the bride back keep her dead keep
[55:24] her in sins and trespass passes and
[55:27] unbelief and sealing her ER behind um
[55:31] behind Roman seals so we needed a
[55:35] resurrection and maybe you were in a
[55:38] tomb where sealed with Roman seals of
[55:40] the Creeds of man of rituals religious
[55:43] edicts and and decrees and and you can
[55:47] name it dis denominational tomb or have
[55:50] any kind of name on the tomb but you see
[55:53] Satan was going to make sure you stay
[55:57] dead sealed in a religious tomb but as
[56:01] brother bradam preached and it is the
[56:03] rising of the sun he says for the bright
[56:06] age for there for the first time there's
[56:09] should be a resurrection out of dark
[56:13] denominationalism and to do that will be
[56:15] a message that the full full maturity of
[56:18] the word is turned back again in full
[56:20] power amen bringing being waved over the
[56:24] People by the same signs and wonders
[56:26] that he did back there because I live
[56:29] you shall live also speaking to his wife
[56:32] because I live you shall live also what
[56:34] a resurrection that was 2,000 years ago
[56:38] and what a resurrection this is to be
[56:41] Quicken from the dead to be made alive
[56:45] in Christ Jesus by God's quickening
[56:47] power but not only was the church that
[56:50] way you were that
[56:53] way amen you were that way if you if you
[56:56] look in Ephesians chapter 2 you will see
[56:58] you were dead in sins and
[57:02] trespasses amen and and when and you
[57:06] walked and you walked when you the way
[57:08] you used to walk when you conformed to
[57:11] the ways of the world to the ruler of
[57:13] the power of the air the spirit that is
[57:16] now working in the children of
[57:18] Disobedience and all of us live that way
[57:20] at one time indulging in his Desires in
[57:24] his thoughts and like the rest of us
[57:26] because of our first birth we were
[57:29] children of Wrath as others amen but
[57:32] because of his great love for us God who
[57:37] is rich in Mercy amen when we were dead
[57:41] in our s sins and trespasses amen he
[57:45] hath made us alive amen for it is by
[57:49] Grace you are saved and God has raised
[57:52] us up with him given you a resurrection
[57:56] and seated us with him in Heavenly
[58:00] places in position and Authority in
[58:03] Heavenly
[58:06] dominions how wonderful that is how
[58:09] glorious oh my dead and sins and
[58:12] trespasses Bound by sin's chains like
[58:16] the woman at the well Satan has put
[58:19] chains of adultery upon her and then
[58:21] religious chains of the Samaritan
[58:24] religion sealed in that that tomb until
[58:27] Jesus had a need to pass by her way amen
[58:32] and the say and that saved Jesus as I
[58:34] look upon this crowd this morning I can
[58:36] see ones one here one there many here
[58:40] many there that Jesus had a need to pass
[58:43] by your way amen and he found you in
[58:46] that same condition sealed in kept down
[58:50] deprived pushed back dead in your sins
[58:54] and
[58:54] trespasses he but down on the inside was
[58:58] a predestinated seed and the same God
[59:02] that said in the beginning let there be
[59:04] light and there was light that same God
[59:07] sent his light to Dawn down in the
[59:14] darkness and that seed came
[59:17] forth never to be never to go back
[59:22] again I said never to go back again
[59:27] that's
[59:28] us as brother Bradman went on to say in
[59:32] that it is rising of the sun that's what
[59:34] he proved Hallelujah that's what Easter
[59:37] proved he was not only the word but he
[59:39] was God himself the Dynamics in the word
[59:43] that made the body of Jesus Christ cold
[59:45] dead and stiff in the grave shake to
[59:48] life again and rise again and roll away
[59:51] the stone I am he that was dead so dead
[59:55] took the sun said he was dead the moon
[59:58] said he was dead the Stars said he was
[1:00:00] dead all nature said he was dead and now
[1:00:03] the whole world has to recognize that
[1:00:05] he's alive again and he was not only the
[1:00:08] mechanics God's word but he was the
[1:00:10] Dynamics to prove it and as she be in
[1:00:14] the groom the bride has to come forth
[1:00:17] because it's a part of him and it can
[1:00:20] only be the manifestations of the
[1:00:23] fulfilling of all the revelations of any
[1:00:25] other that spoke with the bride he can
[1:00:27] only
[1:00:28] manifest now that was a
[1:00:31] mouthful somebody just give you I'm just
[1:00:34] going to bring it back to you again this
[1:00:36] bride can only be the
[1:00:40] manifestation of the fulfilling of all
[1:00:43] the revelations any others throughout
[1:00:47] the Bible spoke of the Bride it can only
[1:00:51] manifest and that word manifest means
[1:00:54] make clear and obvious what was once
[1:00:58] obscure
[1:01:01] scripture now Paul spoke of this he
[1:01:05] spoke of a bride so here I'm going to
[1:01:07] give you just you know this again bring
[1:01:09] this to your Forefront of your thinking
[1:01:12] Paul spoke of a bride that would be the
[1:01:15] manifestation of the Fulfillment of this
[1:01:17] Revelation that he had when he spoke and
[1:01:20] said that Christ would present himself a
[1:01:23] glorious Church Without spot wrinkle or
[1:01:26] blemish so the end time church is a
[1:01:30] manifestation in other words she is to
[1:01:33] make clear and obvious amen the very
[1:01:37] Revelation that Paul prophesied of being
[1:01:41] she will be the embodiment of that
[1:01:43] scripture amen a bride a church without
[1:01:47] spot or without wrinkle or without a
[1:01:53] blemish and you're asking yourself how
[1:01:55] am I going to do this well it won't be
[1:01:57] by Man's power it won't be by man's
[1:02:00] might but by my spirit sayith the lord
[1:02:04] it's going to take the Holy
[1:02:07] Ghost hallelujah it's going to take
[1:02:09] quickening power and now and now amen
[1:02:13] you see she will be alive I'm I'm
[1:02:15] showing you again the scripture she will
[1:02:17] be the embodiment of the scripture she
[1:02:20] will be alive and remain at the coming
[1:02:23] of the
[1:02:24] Lord amen
[1:02:26] so she will not be just barely
[1:02:29] surviving amen but she will be rising as
[1:02:33] he did and he didn't rise defeated but
[1:02:36] he rose a champion and I'm telling you
[1:02:39] this bride is not going to rise a
[1:02:42] defeated people but she's going to rise
[1:02:44] a
[1:02:46] champion a champion over sin over
[1:02:49] Darkness over hell itself an overcomer
[1:02:52] in this age
[1:02:57] now Jesus spoke of the Bride himself so
[1:03:02] now here's another Revelation or or a
[1:03:06] fulfillment of scripture that must be
[1:03:09] fulfilled for he spoke and he says that
[1:03:12] my church will be built on the
[1:03:16] revelation of who I
[1:03:18] am and he said the Gates of Hell will
[1:03:22] not Prevail against her no tomb of
[1:03:27] religion will hold her down and no
[1:03:31] nothing nothing no seal no no chains
[1:03:36] that the devil will try to put on you is
[1:03:40] going to hold you
[1:03:41] back Hallelujah because the resurrected
[1:03:44] Christ in your life will burst through
[1:03:47] the
[1:03:48] chains of every darkness of every sin of
[1:03:52] all unbelief
[1:03:58] oh how much time could we spend on the
[1:04:00] scripture and we have who have spoke uh
[1:04:04] the scriptures that has spoke and
[1:04:05] prophesying of a bride we can speak
[1:04:08] about Abraham and Sarah the prophecy of
[1:04:12] Alazar are going to go get a bride for
[1:04:14] Isaac we can speak of Israel um getting
[1:04:17] married to God when they made the
[1:04:19] Covenant at Mount Si we could talk about
[1:04:22] the entire book of The Song of Solomon
[1:04:25] that has that speaks of the love affair
[1:04:28] between God and His elect lady we can
[1:04:31] speak about Ruth and Esther and on and
[1:04:34] on and on we could go because this bride
[1:04:37] this end time bride is the Fulfillment
[1:04:40] of all the
[1:04:42] scriptures that spoke of the Bride so
[1:04:47] even as Jesus was the Fulfillment of all
[1:04:50] the Old Testament amen even now his
[1:04:54] bride is a fulf fillment of the entire
[1:04:57] word of
[1:05:00] God Amen now so as we look at this he
[1:05:06] says if it does something different from
[1:05:08] the groom it isn't the
[1:05:11] bride so go back and see what Jesus did
[1:05:15] see what his attitude toward the sick
[1:05:17] was see what come on see if he had
[1:05:20] prayer lines see if he didn't lay hands
[1:05:23] on the sick see if he didn't cast out
[1:05:26] Devils come on see see if he see if he
[1:05:29] didn't tell us to speak with new tongues
[1:05:31] see if he didn't tell us come on see
[1:05:34] what he
[1:05:35] did amen what about those who were were
[1:05:39] chained like the woman at the well that
[1:05:41] wasn't a physical sickness that was a
[1:05:43] spiritual sickness but she found
[1:05:49] Deliverance so the bride will have the
[1:05:51] same
[1:05:52] attitude even toward the Lost
[1:05:56] even toward
[1:05:58] prodal that God
[1:06:00] has because as we wrap up the the New
[1:06:04] Testament in in the Book of Revelation
[1:06:07] it tells you of the spirit and the bride
[1:06:10] speaking in
[1:06:11] unison not
[1:06:13] independently not her with her own
[1:06:15] message and him with another but hear
[1:06:18] them both speaking together and the
[1:06:20] spirit and the bride
[1:06:22] say come
[1:06:25] not us for no
[1:06:30] more
[1:06:31] hallelujah amen oh yes so if it does
[1:06:35] something different from the groom it
[1:06:38] isn't the bride amen I I hear the
[1:06:41] prophet pray and he prays like this and
[1:06:44] and I and this is as he would start out
[1:06:47] the meetings for the the church a series
[1:06:50] that he would preach and here would be
[1:06:52] his prayer
[1:06:55] and I think it ought to be our prayer
[1:06:57] for 2025 he said May during this meeting
[1:07:01] it cause men and women to take a hold
[1:07:04] newly or new hold so may you raise up
[1:07:08] speakers with tongues interpretation
[1:07:11] interpreters of tongues may you ra raise
[1:07:14] up gifts of Prophecy raise up preachers
[1:07:17] and pastors evangelists and so forth
[1:07:19] that the church might be edified raise
[1:07:22] missionaries to go into the field Yonder
[1:07:25] and bring forth with this glorious
[1:07:26] Gospel wherever the word shall go may it
[1:07:29] fall into good ground bringing forth a h
[1:07:32] hundredfold for we believe where at the
[1:07:35] End of the Age the consummation is
[1:07:39] near amen I Wonder Could That Be The
[1:07:42] Prayer of evening light
[1:07:44] Tabernacle amen for this service this
[1:07:47] morning amen again and hear you himm I I
[1:07:51] shared this the other night with W with
[1:07:53] our our our uh the group that was
[1:07:56] gathered and I and I spoke about this
[1:07:58] very this very quote and father God I
[1:08:01] can hear the scream of the lamb at
[1:08:04] Calvary and it makes me seek and Hunger
[1:08:07] and
[1:08:09] thirst that's what it ought to do to us
[1:08:12] I wonder if we can if we can just have a
[1:08:15] renewing of Calvary in our lives this
[1:08:17] morning until it makes us seek and
[1:08:22] Hunger and thirst oh I see his little
[1:08:26] children dying Satan has got them bound
[1:08:29] up some of them are sick and Afflicted
[1:08:32] oh God and that cry that cry of a sinful
[1:08:36] world that cry of people that's been
[1:08:39] caught up by the devil who wants to be
[1:08:42] liberated and they're screaming for
[1:08:45] Mercy Oh My Stop a moment I think about
[1:08:51] I think about for a moment my mind goes
[1:08:53] to the maniac of G at and there he was
[1:08:57] there way across the sea Jesus was busy
[1:09:00] with with thousands around him and
[1:09:03] minister to them and feeding 5000s and
[1:09:05] on and on and on and all and and he he
[1:09:08] gets out into a boat and he goes to go
[1:09:12] across the sea and he goes to leave all
[1:09:15] of these and why because there's
[1:09:19] one there's one oh he's a worthless
[1:09:23] individual he's been in trouble with the
[1:09:26] law amen he's been in Chains and
[1:09:29] darkness he's been in tombs he's hurt so
[1:09:33] bad he's cut himself he hates who he is
[1:09:37] and he can't do anything about it and
[1:09:40] he's out of his
[1:09:44] mind I'll tell you there's many degrees
[1:09:46] to that and if you're not a child of God
[1:09:49] this morning you're not surrendered to
[1:09:51] Christ you're out of your
[1:09:53] mind there is a peace that surpasses all
[1:09:56] understanding and you don't have to stay
[1:09:58] in that condition when there is a
[1:10:04] savior but he must have woke up just for
[1:10:06] a moment come to himself just a moment
[1:10:09] as those Legions of devils took a hold
[1:10:13] of him and had him bound but just for a
[1:10:17] moment his lips became free enough just
[1:10:20] to say a little prayer maybe it was just
[1:10:23] a whisper Jes God God help
[1:10:29] me and from there he slips back into his
[1:10:34] Insanity demon possession driven in
[1:10:38] tombs nobody wanted him rejected
[1:10:42] couldn't live at home no more beat up
[1:10:44] the family ruined lives and
[1:10:49] wrecked a Despicable horrible individual
[1:10:54] but a seed of God
[1:10:56] hidden down in there was a seat of God
[1:10:59] that was that was crying for
[1:11:04] manifestation come your just for a
[1:11:07] moment to say God help me goes right
[1:11:10] back in and with that Jesus gets in a
[1:11:15] boat because God was right there oh I
[1:11:20] wish he was had close to me this morning
[1:11:22] I wish he would could get a boat and
[1:11:24] come to me he's closer than that he's
[1:11:26] right here in the form of his holy
[1:11:29] spirit amen physically there he was
[1:11:31] there in Jesus Christ and would have to
[1:11:34] go over boat and and then Satan seeing
[1:11:37] him was coming he would stay cause
[1:11:39] storms to come up and everything else to
[1:11:41] try to destroy him where he could never
[1:11:44] get
[1:11:45] across but Jesus goes on speaks peace to
[1:11:49] the storms where the thousands of devils
[1:11:52] are going to try to destroy him and now
[1:11:55] he comes to meet the thousands of devils
[1:11:58] that are in this man and he walks out
[1:12:00] and puts his foot out there and this man
[1:12:02] comes to meet him with every intentions
[1:12:05] of destroying
[1:12:07] him but let me tell you once in the
[1:12:10] presence of
[1:12:11] Jesus chains break Darkness fleas demons
[1:12:17] leave Hallelujah I've seen it happen
[1:12:21] I've seen men and women same condition
[1:12:24] lost and Si and hopeless and a god rich
[1:12:27] in Mercy could buy their way and break
[1:12:31] the chains of Darkness off their

[1:13:51] heroism and the high blood of Christ
[1:13:54] beating through their veins as it was
[1:13:57] that's been changed by the great miracle

[1:14:33] the temple I want to see the Holy Ghost
[1:14:35] move out in power and demonstration of
[1:14:38] the Holy

[1:14:45] liberate he's the only thing one that
[1:14:48] can set
[1:14:49] free all of our man's psychology all our
[1:14:53] man's efforts har All laws and rules and
[1:14:57] regulations won't do it the only thing

[1:16:00] conventions that has been here yet
[1:16:04] because we ask it in Christ's
[1:16:06] name I believe God will answer that
[1:16:10] prayer I believe if we'll pray it this
[1:16:12] morning God will answer it
[1:16:15] here condemnation R
[1:16:18] representation brother brandham begins
[1:16:20] praise and he says granted father heal
[1:16:22] all the sick and afflicted bring back to
[1:16:26] the oldfashioned Revival type of people
[1:16:30] again amen bring them back to original
[1:16:33] Pentecost bring them back to the the
[1:16:36] blessings bring them back like Pentecost
[1:16:38] fell at
[1:16:40] ad33 give them the Pentecostal blessings
[1:16:43] May the power of God come into the
[1:16:45] church May there be Divine Healing gifts
[1:16:49] give to the church May there be speakers
[1:16:51] with tongues interpreters of tongues May
[1:16:54] there be Gifts of Prophecy and all
[1:16:56] different manifestation not make believe
[1:16:59] or try to believe and put on but may it
[1:17:01] be real genuine coming with the word the
[1:17:04] word of God made known prophesying
[1:17:07] things that come to
[1:17:10] pass how many can say
[1:17:15] Amen this of course the return to the
[1:17:19] original Pentecost couldn't even happen
[1:17:22] till Malachi 4 came
[1:17:26] and now instead of repeating the cycle
[1:17:29] of Revival and
[1:17:31] death we ought to be in the place this
[1:17:34] morning of resurrection of even raising
[1:17:38] the dead listen here is the high bar
[1:17:42] that is set in God of this evil age is
[1:17:44] one of the last things that was imparted
[1:17:47] To Us by the seventh angel Messenger as
[1:17:50] he was winding down the last year of his
[1:17:54] life and the last few sermons that he
[1:17:56] would preach and this is about the one
[1:17:57] the last sermons that he would preach to
[1:17:59] his
[1:18:00] Tabernacle and he said now she has caus
[1:18:02] the whole world to accept the scientific
[1:18:05] leadership of the educational program
[1:18:07] that Satan has given her under the name
[1:18:10] of the of a church the leadership of an
[1:18:12] educational scientific program I'm
[1:18:14] picturing to you the God of this world
[1:18:17] when she as Eve had the very feeling of
[1:18:20] God's word in her hand and she could
[1:18:23] have t took God's word but what did she
[1:18:25] do to that instead of taring for the
[1:18:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost let science
[1:18:31] prove to her that the Holy Ghost was
[1:18:33] only for the disciples and instead of
[1:18:37] keeping Divine Healing going when she
[1:18:40] ought to be now raising the dead and
[1:18:44] doing great Miracles she has led Satan
[1:18:48] under the leadership of religious men
[1:18:52] try or take the word of God and try to
[1:18:55] say it was for another age and she's
[1:18:58] believed it and when the Bible said the
[1:19:02] things I do say you do also Jesus said
[1:19:04] go into all the world and preach the
[1:19:06] gospel to every creature and we're still
[1:19:08] creatures and what he's trying to tell
[1:19:10] us this is still in
[1:19:12] effect and these signs shall follow
[1:19:15] every one of them that believes she
[1:19:17] denies every bit of it she denies all
[1:19:19] the Supernatural and she is swapped it
[1:19:22] for his intellectual con deception of
[1:19:25] the Bible where priests and holy fathers
[1:19:28] are so-called and Bishops and Archbishop
[1:19:30] and District where district prors and
[1:19:33] general overseers and so forth have put
[1:19:35] their own interpretation to it and God
[1:19:38] has Let Them Sit their dead is
[1:19:45] 12:00 the only things left in this last
[1:19:48] day I'm continue reading is a bunch of
[1:19:52] little Pentecostals with a bunch of
[1:19:53] music whooped up as hard as he can
[1:19:56] running up and down the aisles speaking
[1:19:58] in tongues and
[1:19:59] shouting and having a form of godliness
[1:20:02] but denying the word thereof and I want
[1:20:05] to say that's not
[1:20:11] us we are not word
[1:20:14] deniers tell them to be baptized in the
[1:20:17] name of Jesus Christ laugh in your face
[1:20:20] that's not
[1:20:23] us we are wor word
[1:20:26] Believers but that but God goes right on
[1:20:29] making it so just the same proven his
[1:20:31] word to be so now in the message spoken
[1:20:35] words Original Seed is a great series if
[1:20:37] you've never listened to it or read it
[1:20:39] you know you should and in that great
[1:20:42] message he would go and look back at his
[1:20:46] ministry and he said the word has now
[1:20:49] been sown he said we have actually got
[1:20:52] several crops that have been planted the
[1:20:54] Baptist under the head planner of Billy
[1:20:56] Graham has planted um his easy believism
[1:21:00] and they and they are now going to reap
[1:21:02] a harvest of that and he said all
[1:21:04] Roberts on the other hand would the
[1:21:06] Pentecostals have have went in their
[1:21:08] faith and prosperity movement and they
[1:21:11] have sowed the seeds for that and that's
[1:21:13] what they will
[1:21:15] produce but he says the word has also
[1:21:18] been sown and it will produce a crop so
[1:21:23] he saw his ministry as the sewing
[1:21:28] rain he emphatically denied that isusa
[1:21:32] street was the latter rain or the final
[1:21:34] outpouring of the spirit no indeed she
[1:21:38] was not the
[1:21:39] grain she was not the one to head up the
[1:21:43] wheat plant remember the Capstone for
[1:21:45] the wheat plant would be the grain it
[1:21:46] would be the head so when the grain
[1:21:49] comes to the head or the wheat comes the
[1:21:51] head it's the grain right so it's the
[1:21:54] cap Stone of the plant that's what we're
[1:21:56] talking about a word bride exactly like
[1:21:59] the seed that was planted so you see the
[1:22:02] she was but ausa Street was not the
[1:22:05] grain she was not the one to head up the
[1:22:08] wheat plant for it grows from seed to
[1:22:11] the head of grain and and because as he
[1:22:16] explained in the church ages he said
[1:22:18] this age just um started just after the
[1:22:21] turn of the 20th century and it was be
[1:22:25] the age in which the true church would
[1:22:28] return to being the bride she was at
[1:22:31] Pentecost now I want you to know that's
[1:22:33] still God's
[1:22:35] aim that's still God's plan for the
[1:22:39] bride to return to be in the church true
[1:22:42] church to return to be in the bride she
[1:22:44] was at Pentecost he said we know that
[1:22:48] there must of necessity be a return of
[1:22:51] dynamic power so to do that Dynamic
[1:22:56] power has to come with the word she has
[1:23:00] received are you with me now so he said
[1:23:03] the Believers sense this in this
[1:23:05] 1906 as they was sense this in their
[1:23:09] spirits and they begin to cry to God for
[1:23:12] new outpouring such as was in the first
[1:23:15] century and what seemed to be the answer
[1:23:18] notice this what seemed to be the answer
[1:23:21] not what was the answer but it seemed it
[1:23:23] was the answer came as many began to
[1:23:26] speak in tongues and manifest gifts of
[1:23:29] the Spirit and it was then believed that
[1:23:32] this indeed was the long awaited
[1:23:35] restoration and that's what they preach
[1:23:37] we are the restoration we are the book
[1:23:39] of Acts church it's it's returned again
[1:23:41] that's what they believe that's what
[1:23:43] they preach but as brother brandham said
[1:23:45] it was
[1:23:48] not for the latter Reign can only come
[1:23:53] after the former reign rain which is the
[1:23:55] spring or teaching rain so the latter
[1:23:59] rain then is the Harvest
[1:24:03] rain so how could this be the real thing
[1:24:07] when the teaching rain had not come the
[1:24:10] prophet messenger who was sent to teach
[1:24:14] the people and turn the hearts of the
[1:24:16] children back to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:24:18] had not yet come thus what was thought
[1:24:22] to be the restoration and the final
[1:24:25] quickening unto the Rapture had not come
[1:24:28] and it was a mixture of the unrighteous
[1:24:31] partaking of spiritual blessing and
[1:24:34] manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we kept
[1:24:36] pointing out to you and it was also
[1:24:39] devil power as men were under the
[1:24:41] control of devils yet no one seemed to
[1:24:45] realize it and then to prove it was not
[1:24:48] the
[1:24:49] real these people even before second
[1:24:52] generation had appeared or organized and
[1:24:55] wrote their unscriptural doctrines and
[1:24:58] built their own fences as every other
[1:25:01] group ahead of them
[1:25:05] did
[1:25:07] now but let me talk about this this
[1:25:10] bride's Revival is the latter
[1:25:14] rain and it has been sewn with the word
[1:25:18] and let me just say for 60
[1:25:21] years now we have since we receiving the
[1:25:24] message we have we have been laying word
[1:25:28] up on top of word we have been sewing
[1:25:32] the seeds for
[1:25:37] Revival
[1:25:39] Hallelujah now it is it's it is let me
[1:25:43] just say emphatically it is the long
[1:25:46] awaited restoration where the true
[1:25:49] church returns to being the bride she
[1:25:52] was at Pentecost so we know then that
[1:25:55] there must be a necessity a return of
[1:25:59] dynamic
[1:26:02] power because this bride cannot leave as
[1:26:06] a word only
[1:26:08] bride it will take the Dynamics of the
[1:26:11] Holy Ghost to lift her up out of here in
[1:26:15] the
[1:26:17] glory now so as we look at this for a
[1:26:22] moment I want to just share with with
[1:26:24] you another quotation this is from a
[1:26:27] message perseverance and he says you
[1:26:29] know when Jesus preached there wasn't 1%
[1:26:33] of one millionth of the people of the
[1:26:34] Earth ever heard of him look what John
[1:26:38] heard look what heard John to make
[1:26:40] preparation see it's the elected that
[1:26:43] hears
[1:26:45] it well if this was true everybody would
[1:26:47] believe it
[1:26:49] no it isn't so right it didn't happen in
[1:26:52] jesus' day it won't happen in this day
[1:26:55] in fact it's absolutely the opposite I
[1:26:58] can show you in the scripture that all
[1:27:00] will wonder after the Beast and His
[1:27:06] Image so the whole world will never
[1:27:08] believe
[1:27:09] it and the majority will never receive
[1:27:13] it and it'll be only a minority that
[1:27:15] will ever receive it you said well you
[1:27:18] got a big church we are a
[1:27:21] minority first of all I mean I'll tell
[1:27:24] you again we're an endangered
[1:27:28] species Satan would snuff us out he
[1:27:31] could amen if he could do it he
[1:27:34] would that's what I meant to say now so
[1:27:38] he says he says only the elected that
[1:27:42] hears it and he said that's right no man
[1:27:44] can come to me except my father draws
[1:27:46] him first and all the father has given
[1:27:49] me will come that's right now I believe
[1:27:53] there's a church coming into that
[1:27:56] Perfection that Ministry of perfection
[1:28:00] where the offices where Apostles
[1:28:02] prophets teachers pastors evangelists
[1:28:04] for the Perfection of the church them
[1:28:07] pastors and teachers and so forth will
[1:28:09] be so with the word until the whole
[1:28:12] thing will work right up to the coming
[1:28:15] of the Lord I believe that and I believe
[1:28:17] we're in that time
[1:28:19] now Hallelujah and that's what we have
[1:28:22] done for 60 years we we have been seed
[1:28:26] sers tell me what the ministry of the
[1:28:28] son of man was he said the he showed the
[1:28:32] parable of the ser and he said the the
[1:28:35] son of man is the
[1:28:38] Ser the Ser in white is the son of
[1:28:42] man amen so it's Christ how's he doing
[1:28:46] it through his Five
[1:28:48] Fingers of a fivefold Ministry SE in the
[1:28:52] word
[1:28:57] now that's what's been done for 60 years
[1:29:01] we've swn the seed with the messenger to
[1:29:04] bring forth a crop a pure word in this
[1:29:07] harvest season so I'm going to just tell
[1:29:10] you the if if Pentecost ausa Street was
[1:29:15] not the
[1:29:17] real the real must come
[1:29:25] come on now if she and the prophet tells
[1:29:28] us she was not the
[1:29:30] real so the real must
[1:29:36] come she's prophesied of in all the
[1:29:40] scripture now watch it is the rising of
[1:29:43] the sun brother brandham confirms this
[1:29:46] he says there has been churches churches
[1:29:49] Brides brides churches Brides brides but
[1:29:53] there's got to come
[1:29:55] one Hallelujah there has to come a real
[1:29:59] bride there must come one listen now
[1:30:03] that's not only got the mechanics that's
[1:30:05] the word but the Dynamics of it and
[1:30:08] makes that church live but move on in
[1:30:11] the power of the
[1:30:13] resurrection and until we come to that
[1:30:17] place he says what good does it do to
[1:30:20] polish the hubs now he's talking about
[1:30:23] two c s that are set out and both of
[1:30:25] them are off the similar line one's got
[1:30:28] fire one of them doesn't both of them
[1:30:30] are filled up with
[1:30:33] gasoline and he said what does it good
[1:30:35] do to shine it up make it all pretty and
[1:30:37] everything else and it won't
[1:30:39] run that's what I've said if it won't
[1:30:41] run down to Divine Healing what good is
[1:30:43] it if it won't run down to the baptism
[1:30:46] of the Holy Ghost for people get a real
[1:30:48] experience with God and a life change
[1:30:51] what good is
[1:30:52] it you're just you know it might be a
[1:30:54] pretty building it might be plush pews
[1:30:58] though we might have fine worship we
[1:31:00] might have good singing we might have
[1:31:02] everything but what good is
[1:31:03] it to just polish the
[1:31:09] hubs what do good does it do to give her
[1:31:12] a facelift or a simonized job now that's
[1:31:15] going to take you back a few years what
[1:31:17] in the world's a simonized job well it
[1:31:19] was a product where they took and it had
[1:31:22] a little fine Grid in it it and it would
[1:31:25] you know it would get rid of the uh the
[1:31:28] glaze that was on the car and bring out
[1:31:30] the shine amen so he said what what good
[1:31:33] does it do to give it a s s simonized
[1:31:36] job or or polish it up when there is no
[1:31:39] Dynamics in it no matter how much the
[1:31:43] mechanics prove to be right there has to
[1:31:46] be a Dynamics to make it
[1:31:49] work that's why I say she's going to be
[1:31:51] a living bride
[1:31:53] not a dead
[1:31:55] church and now watch now until that
[1:31:59] church becomes both Dynamics and
[1:32:04] mechanics and the spirit of God that
[1:32:06] moved him to do the things he did if he
[1:32:09] hit on 16 cylinders so will the
[1:32:13] bride and he said but he said in in John
[1:32:16] 14:12 he that believeth on me the works
[1:32:18] I do shall I he do also I'll give him a
[1:32:21] charge of my Dynamics in his mechan PCS
[1:32:24] and the world will not be able to
[1:32:26] withstand it and I'll raise him up again
[1:32:29] at the last day that's the Easter
[1:32:33] message I'm going to tell you this
[1:32:35] morning that's the resurrection
[1:32:38] message amen what is it the Dynamics and
[1:32:41] mechanics together the mechanics without
[1:32:45] Dynamics no good right I don't care how
[1:32:49] much you know the Bible how much you
[1:32:50] explain the seals how much you know the
[1:32:53] mystery how how much all of you you can
[1:32:55] get it and line it up all you without it
[1:32:57] no good amen neither is the Dynamics
[1:33:00] without the mechanics you can scream and
[1:33:04] shout and jump up and down all you want
[1:33:06] to and deny this word it won't do any
[1:33:09] good so while brother Tim sound like
[1:33:10] y'all you know you scream and you shout
[1:33:12] we're not word
[1:33:15] deniers not a word amen we are not word
[1:33:20] deniers but those who are Scream and
[1:33:23] Shout and jump up and down all the while
[1:33:25] denying the word he said you're just
[1:33:28] cranking on the Pistons got the got the
[1:33:31] spark there to fly but no gasoline to
[1:33:33] fire it by it'll only work as they come
[1:33:38] together amen so one will sit still and
[1:33:41] the other will go up I tell you I don't
[1:33:43] want to be the car sitting still I want
[1:33:46] to be the one going
[1:33:48] up amen listen now when the Dynamics
[1:33:51] came that fire was made to connect w w
[1:33:55] with that Octane and the gasoline and
[1:33:59] and when that explodes it causes
[1:34:01] combustion and that combustion moves
[1:34:04] every motion every move for he's the
[1:34:07] same yesterday today and forever that's
[1:34:10] the
[1:34:10] resurrection that's the real power of
[1:34:13] God mechanics with the Dynamics notice
[1:34:16] it's not it's the spirit that quickens
[1:34:19] it's the spark that fires it's not the
[1:34:21] gas that fires it's the spark heart that
[1:34:24] fires the gas you can do nothing without
[1:34:27] me but with me you do can do all things
[1:34:30] as he is the word it's the father living
[1:34:32] father sent me so send I you and the
[1:34:35] father that fired me and pushed me into
[1:34:37] everything I only do that which is pleas
[1:34:39] unto God now as he sent me so send I you
[1:34:42] with the same mechanics and it takes the
[1:34:44] same Dynamics to operate it and these
[1:34:47] signs shall follow them that claim to hi
[1:34:49] the mechanics the Dynamics will take
[1:34:52] place
[1:34:53] so if we got the real word we're going
[1:34:55] to have Dynamics with
[1:34:57] it
[1:34:59] amen oh brother Tim you know you're
[1:35:02] blasting us you're you're saying this
[1:35:04] listen I'm not denying you got it I'm
[1:35:06] just saying we want more of
[1:35:11] it amen amen I'd like to take a drive
[1:35:15] through the word of God this morning I'd
[1:35:17] like to take a tour through his
[1:35:19] promises I'd like to as I drive by I'd
[1:35:23] like to get me a good old glass of of
[1:35:25] Holy Ghost
[1:35:28] wine Hallelujah that changes my eyesight
[1:35:32] my thoughts focuses me only on Christ
[1:35:35] because this and don't confuse your
[1:35:37] focus it Focus you right on Jesus come
[1:35:40] on church amen I'd like to see a church
[1:35:43] drive right down to Healing Amen to
[1:35:47] miracles to see him prodical come home
[1:35:50] Devils cast out amen I'd like to see the
[1:35:54] Holy Ghost move in his power that's what
[1:35:57] we want to see a church with the
[1:35:59] mechanics and the Dynamics
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:05] together in this last day church he will
[1:36:09] cap it off expressing himself in the
[1:36:12] fullness of in the fullness of God in
[1:36:16] Bride form listen Christ is a mystery
[1:36:19] and there would come a time when he
[1:36:21] would Express himself in fullness of his
[1:36:24] godhead deity through his church have
[1:36:27] preeminence that means the oversight the
[1:36:29] leadership in his church be the main one
[1:36:32] oh my what the anointed man now the
[1:36:37] anointed people oh my to bring back the
[1:36:40] anointed bride and the bridegroom
[1:36:42] anointed by why accepting what Eve
[1:36:46] turned out here's what we are anointed
[1:36:50] by by accepting what Eve turned
[1:36:55] down and coming back with the anointing
[1:36:59] of the word because he said my word is
[1:37:00] spirit and Anointed with the word what
[1:37:02] Eve turned down he comes back and we
[1:37:08] accept so we look all the way back to
[1:37:11] the fall in Genesis and look now at the
[1:37:15] finishing stone at the end what Eve
[1:37:19] turned
[1:37:20] down amen we come back he he comes back
[1:37:24] and we
[1:37:27] accept Hallelujah now what did Eve turn
[1:37:32] down that God would keep his
[1:37:39] word come on she allowed the serpent to
[1:37:43] put a question on God's
[1:37:50] word and we accept it by having no
[1:37:54] question no longer
[1:37:57] questioning God's
[1:38:01] word we're not to put a question on
[1:38:03] God's
[1:38:04] word huh this Mountain's too big my
[1:38:09] child's got too many problems this
[1:38:11] sickness is too
[1:38:13] great this problem is too
[1:38:16] hard this trial I can't ever
[1:38:19] overcome I'll never Rise Above This
[1:38:24] what are you doing you're limiting God
[1:38:27] you're putting a question on his word
[1:38:29] don't put a question on God's word even
[1:38:31] today Satan will constantly put a
[1:38:34] question on God's word to bind the Holy
[1:38:37] Spirit these are chains to keep you in
[1:38:41] tuned Amen to keep the Holy Spirit from
[1:38:45] moving that's what brother bam said he
[1:38:47] said the the Holy Spirit has been bound
[1:38:50] by these denomination in these
[1:38:52] denominational Rivers
[1:38:54] at the doors of Creeds and dogmas for
[1:38:56] 2,000 years and it's going to be loosed
[1:39:00] in the evening time by the evening time
[1:39:04] message all right so if it's
[1:39:08] healing he will whisper days of prayer
[1:39:12] lines are
[1:39:14] over you can't major on a
[1:39:17] minor now that's
[1:39:20] true come on even some of the what
[1:39:23] serpent said was
[1:39:26] true yeah as God said when he comes to
[1:39:30] Jesus he quotes the word a mount of of
[1:39:33] Temptation right in the
[1:39:36] wilderness and he uses
[1:39:39] scripture
[1:39:41] right against against Christ so he'll
[1:39:45] come right along and he will as brother
[1:39:47] randam said not coat the word quote the
[1:39:49] word but coat the
[1:39:51] word and he'll just twist it he'll turn
[1:39:55] it take the very words of God and turn
[1:40:04] it you know I've seen
[1:40:07] people have a spirit right there on
[1:40:09] their
[1:40:10] ear that you say something to them you
[1:40:12] could actually compliment them and they
[1:40:14] we
[1:40:19] twisted turn it into something bad
[1:40:24] they can sit right in a church hear the
[1:40:27] word preach and he'll twist
[1:40:32] it and the only thing we'll do will add
[1:40:34] to their
[1:40:37] complex and here Satan will come he'll
[1:40:40] whisper things like you can't major on a
[1:40:43] minor and we
[1:40:45] can't but if we had the major we can
[1:40:47] have the
[1:40:49] minor the major is the Salvation of the
[1:40:52] Soul but if God can save a soul he can
[1:40:55] sure save a body can he it's the earnest
[1:40:59] of
[1:41:01] our
[1:41:03] inheritance so it's you know he'll come
[1:41:06] and Whisper ah the Mind healing it it
[1:41:09] ain't nothing but fish bait anyhow oh
[1:41:11] it's a lot more than fish bait it's the
[1:41:14] very nature of
[1:41:16] God come on Amen if it's gifts he will
[1:41:20] whisper oh we got the perfect word so we
[1:41:23] don't don't need them because it's only
[1:41:25] babies that want that you know the
[1:41:27] immature are are more dignified than
[1:41:29] that it shows you immature to desire
[1:41:32] spiritual gifts yet Paul said to follow
[1:41:36] after charity which is perfection and
[1:41:40] desire spiritual gifts but he said
[1:41:42] rather that you may
[1:41:45] prophesy and he said so you know here
[1:41:48] again you know he will come and he will
[1:41:50] twist the word if it's tongues he will
[1:41:52] misqu quot the word to mock it saying
[1:41:55] well jumping up and down and speaking
[1:41:57] like a kid or jumping up and down like a
[1:41:59] kid and and speaking in tongues is over
[1:42:02] that's not true that's a lie jumping and
[1:42:06] down like a kid to try to speak with
[1:42:09] tongues is over amen we should not try
[1:42:13] to manufacture it we should not try to
[1:42:17] work it
[1:42:18] up that is childish things and we're
[1:42:22] more grown up than that
[1:42:24] we know better than
[1:42:26] that but speaking in tongues is not over
[1:42:29] it's always to be in the church it's one
[1:42:31] of the signs that follows them that
[1:42:34] believe brother bradam sums up his
[1:42:37] Easter resurrection message to his
[1:42:40] church in Jeffersonville with this
[1:42:42] prayer and I want you to hear this is
[1:42:44] this is his last Easter message his he
[1:42:47] said this is my Easter message my
[1:42:51] resurrection message and he declares it
[1:42:54] is the rising of the
[1:42:58] sun the Sun Ain't setting on
[1:43:01] us come on somebody Sun is setting on
[1:43:05] civilization Sun is setting on on this
[1:43:07] world the Sun is setting on man's
[1:43:10] day but it ain't the setting of the Sun
[1:43:13] for us it is the rising of the
[1:43:15] sun Hallelujah and he says arise and
[1:43:19] shine and let thy light be showing out
[1:43:22] to the the world Amen for thy light has
[1:43:26] come so here he prays May then father if
[1:43:31] they're sick may they walk out
[1:43:34] well may if they're crippled may they
[1:43:37] walk out under the power of the Holy
[1:43:40] Ghost if they've been Sinners may they
[1:43:43] walk out washed and clean and the
[1:43:46] mechanics by going in and the Dynamics
[1:43:48] from above the Holy Spirit and catch
[1:43:51] them away Lord Quicken their mortal
[1:43:53] bodies and then we shall hear genuine
[1:43:57] new tones powers of God love Untold
[1:44:01] dying Grace and living grace and a
[1:44:03] resurrected Christ a body a bride
[1:44:06] representing him on the
[1:44:09] earth
[1:44:11] amen now of course if it's anointed
[1:44:16] preaching Satan Will
[1:44:18] shout shut up just play a tape cuz the
[1:44:23] only way to hear the voice of
[1:44:25] God oh yeah oh he gets loud he's got his
[1:44:30] voice going out but listen that ain't
[1:44:32] what the prophet
[1:44:33] taught he said now God could have chose
[1:44:36] to preach the gospel by the Sun by the
[1:44:38] Moon by the Stars by the wind or by
[1:44:40] nature but he chose men to preach the
[1:44:43] gospel and that's where the voice of God
[1:44:46] will come
[1:44:48] from men preaching the gospel that's
[1:44:51] where God's voice
[1:44:53] will come
[1:44:57] from
[1:44:58] and he tells us again in the pma's
[1:45:02] vision he speaks of the son of man which
[1:45:05] we know is Christ that has and he and he
[1:45:08] described in Revelation 1 as having a
[1:45:11] voice of many
[1:45:16] Waters and he
[1:45:19] says quotes there from from Revelation 7
[1:45:23] 15 to tell us what does Waters
[1:45:27] represent and he said the the waters
[1:45:30] which thou sawest is thickness and
[1:45:32] multitudes and peoples and tongues so we
[1:45:35] know that it's the voice of many Waters
[1:45:39] or the voice of many
[1:45:42] people come on the voice of many Waters
[1:45:46] what is his voice he said it's the
[1:45:48] Judgment he said it's the voice of the
[1:45:51] ministers through the holy spirit that
[1:45:53] has cried out to the people in every age
[1:45:56] standing there the voice of many Waters
[1:45:59] Cried Out thickness and multitude the
[1:46:01] voice of those seven stars in his hands
[1:46:03] to every Church age preaching the
[1:46:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism in
[1:46:08] Jesus name speaking in tongues the power
[1:46:10] of God the resurrection of Christ the
[1:46:13] second coming Divine judgment the voice
[1:46:15] of many Waters coming from this one that
[1:46:18] looked like the son of man there again
[1:46:22] the son of man has a
[1:46:25] voice and remember where brother bradam
[1:46:27] said the son of man is being revealed he
[1:46:29] said he's being revealed in the bride
[1:46:32] body amen so again the voice of the many
[1:46:36] Waters and he said that voice is
[1:46:38] screaming out to you even this morning
[1:46:42] am mean like like a soul going down the
[1:46:47] stream and you're you're just like s
[1:46:50] daic gold enjoying the day in the
[1:46:52] Beautiful sunshine and not knowing that
[1:46:55] the laying ahead is
[1:47:00] cataracts not knowing laying ahead is
[1:47:03] his great
[1:47:06] waterfalls what a horrible thing he said
[1:47:08] for a drifting Soul on the sea of life
[1:47:11] no pilot to guide him loose and floating
[1:47:14] with the tides to hear the Roar of the
[1:47:17] great cataracts The Falls what a
[1:47:20] horrible thing it would be to a drifting
[1:47:24] soul and then knowing that you refuse to
[1:47:27] hear your voice his voice that is coming
[1:47:30] out of many Waters sermon after sermon
[1:47:34] witness after
[1:47:37] witness amen I tell you what I I hope
[1:47:39] you don't go to the Judgment because you
[1:47:42] go to the Judgment my voice and the
[1:47:45] voice of many will scream
[1:47:48] out and you'll have no excuse
[1:47:56] well they did this to me and they did
[1:47:58] that and I was wounded and I was hurt by
[1:47:59] The Watchmen and whatever else because
[1:48:02] you know I I was I was really just
[1:48:04] looking for God but you know I got hurt
[1:48:06] and I got wounded and I just gave up on
[1:48:09] religion I gave up on God I throw it
[1:48:10] away the message I threw away everything
[1:48:12] I don't care nothing about it but the
[1:48:15] voice I don't care what your pastor's
[1:48:17] been I don't care what situation been I
[1:48:20] don't care what others have done to you
[1:48:23] I don't care what Satan has throwed in
[1:48:25] your way it doesn't
[1:48:27] matter you must hear that
[1:48:37] voice where a
[1:48:39] voice of many
[1:48:41] Waters saying don't keep going down
[1:48:45] there
[1:48:53] you'll never make it in that canoe of
[1:48:55] life you're
[1:49:02] in you better call for The Old Ship
[1:49:04] isign to come out and rescue you this
[1:49:08] morning God's in the rescue
[1:49:13] business but he can't rescue anybody who
[1:49:15] won't take a hold of the
[1:49:20] lifeline and who knows when it throwed
[1:49:23] out to you for the last
[1:49:29] time so Satan tries to hush the voice of
[1:49:34] God to try to stop the preaching of the
[1:49:38] gospel and of course if it's a genuine
[1:49:42] experience with God Satan will tell
[1:49:44] you believe in the message is
[1:49:47] enough you see these are all whisperings
[1:49:50] of the serpent where he put a question
[1:49:54] on God's
[1:49:56] word well just how did that work out for
[1:50:03] Eve just how did that work
[1:50:06] out some of you have left the message
[1:50:09] you've left the word you've left Christ
[1:50:11] how did that work out for
[1:50:16] you it's not too
[1:50:20] good you go out there
[1:50:23] in a life of sin and it pays its
[1:50:30] wages they're harsh
[1:50:32] wages it's slavery and
[1:50:35] bondage and you think you you just
[1:50:37] thought it was bondage not to wear
[1:50:40] makeup or cut your hair wear something
[1:50:46] sexy and you're in the bondage of
[1:50:48] alcohol and tobacco and sin you can't
[1:50:51] say a word without filthiness coming out
[1:50:53] of your
[1:50:59] mouth you just thought this was
[1:51:04] bondage it is a
[1:51:08] yoke because it's a
[1:51:11] marriage and it's a love it's a
[1:51:15] love life that binds you by your life to
[1:51:20] Christ and you and him are one and you
[1:51:24] love him with all of your heart with all
[1:51:26] of your soul and you don't live in this
[1:51:29] gospel because you don't want to go to
[1:51:31] hell you live it because you love him
[1:51:34] with all your
[1:51:37] heart and you want to please him and you
[1:51:39] want to serve
[1:51:45] him so how did that work out for
[1:51:48] Eve It produced hybrid offspring
[1:51:52] I just believe the
[1:51:54] message and you have the Holy
[1:51:57] Ghost that's why we have frustrated
[1:52:01] kids who are commanded to do right in
[1:52:04] given rules they can't
[1:52:07] keep because they have no power to
[1:52:12] overcome that's why we have churches
[1:52:15] Today l this like an old hen who has not
[1:52:18] been with the mate and she can sit on
[1:52:21] those eggs and fuss over them and turn
[1:52:24] this this way and scold them here and
[1:52:26] give them lectures there and tell them
[1:52:28] how to do right there and those turn
[1:52:30] been around here you've sat that way too
[1:52:32] long you're here you're there you know
[1:52:34] not this way that way and sit on them
[1:52:36] and move them around sitting on her eggs
[1:52:40] try to turn them with psychology oh you
[1:52:42] shouldn't be doing that you know it's I
[1:52:44] hear you I I can I can tell you this
[1:52:46] contaminating you you got to have life
[1:52:48] in you so turn over here we'll give you
[1:52:50] some psychology to turn you this way
[1:52:52] where you where you where you get out of
[1:52:53] your your your pornography and you quit
[1:52:56] your adultery and and we'll give you
[1:52:58] something to you know to self-help kind
[1:53:00] of program and and and give you a
[1:53:02] lecture you know what go try to do
[1:53:04] better just try to be better until we
[1:53:07] have a nestful of rotten
[1:53:12] eggs and the church becomes as spoken in
[1:53:15] the Bible a cage a cage a hold of every
[1:53:20] unclean and hateful bird
[1:53:27] that's how it works
[1:53:33] out cuz you listen to a lot just believe
[1:53:37] the message and you got
[1:53:41] it it's a Whisper Of Satan you don't
[1:53:46] have to have that oldfashioned birth
[1:53:49] where you come down to a real repentance
[1:53:52] and a real turning to God and a turning
[1:53:55] away from
[1:54:05] sin well you say well brother Tim you're
[1:54:07] trying to preach some fantastic
[1:54:09] experience and some fantastic sensation
[1:54:13] that's not what we're doing at all and
[1:54:15] man we we want you to look even even
[1:54:17] today you say well brother Tim what what
[1:54:20] is the evidence how do I know that have
[1:54:22] the Holy Ghost look at your
[1:54:24] life look what you
[1:54:27] were you say well you know it was that
[1:54:30] moment brother Tim might have been in an
[1:54:32] altar it might have been in your seat I
[1:54:34] don't know where it was but it could
[1:54:35] have been in a closet somewhere but that
[1:54:40] moment that you turned to God and
[1:54:42] yielded yourself completely and totally
[1:54:45] to him and you were changed
[1:54:52] I don't remember the day I don't
[1:54:53] remember the very hour I I it wasn't
[1:54:55] wrote on my calendar you don't have to
[1:54:57] know all of that just know amen just
[1:55:01] know just look at yourself and look
[1:55:03] where you come from and look what he did
[1:55:05] for you and look how he changed you and
[1:55:08] look what your desires are and well look
[1:55:10] what the longing in your soul is and you
[1:55:14] know something happened to
[1:55:16] me amen I couldn't do it by myself I
[1:55:19] couldn't lay that down by myself but he
[1:55:22] came he changed
[1:55:26] me I don't care what formor it comes in
[1:55:29] I don't care if you speak in tongues or
[1:55:32] have you Clow in tongues I don't care if
[1:55:34] you roll on the floor or you run down
[1:55:36] the I don't care if you sit in your in
[1:55:38] your chair and they're just moved on by
[1:55:41] the spirit till you can't speak I don't
[1:55:43] care which way it comes as long as it
[1:55:45] comes
[1:55:53] Hallelujah but when he comes you'll
[1:55:57] never be the same again you'll be
[1:56:00] resurrected out of death into life never
[1:56:04] to go back into sin
[1:56:08] anymore
[1:56:10] hallelujah hallelujah amen that's the
[1:56:13] God we serve that's the God we're
[1:56:15] declaring this morning that's the God
[1:56:17] who said I am he that is the same
[1:56:20] yesterday today and forever the Living
[1:56:24] God and what are we doing we are
[1:56:27] accepting what he turned
[1:56:30] down eternal
[1:56:32] [Applause]
[1:56:41] life
[1:56:42] eternal life
[1:56:57] brother Ram
[1:56:58] says in God's word calls for total
[1:57:02] separation now the first Adam that was
[1:57:04] born the world or not born but created
[1:57:06] by God the first Adam separated himself
[1:57:08] from the word to his
[1:57:12] wife now he could have stayed with the
[1:57:14] word if he'd wished to but he separated
[1:57:17] himself from the word to be with his
[1:57:19] wife actually in doing so he was
[1:57:24] prophesying of
[1:57:29] Christ because he too became
[1:57:34] sin that you might become his
[1:57:37] righteousness and when Eve sinned and
[1:57:40] was and he saw what had happened he
[1:57:43] quickly took her to
[1:57:45] himself and together they were sent out
[1:57:48] of the garden that's right but even then
[1:57:53] you you see God wouldn't send his
[1:57:55] children out alone he says I'm coming
[1:57:59] with
[1:58:00] you because I will come as a seed that
[1:58:04] will bruise the head of the
[1:58:07] serpent hallelujah amen and I tell you
[1:58:10] what every child born of him is also a
[1:58:13] serpent Bruiser and a devil
[1:58:17] defeater Hallelujah that's the kind of
[1:58:20] God that we're serving one that would
[1:58:22] tread on the head of the
[1:58:24] serpent and turn down Satan's
[1:58:33] lie that's exactly what the common
[1:58:36] carnal church member does today
[1:58:38] separates themselves from the true
[1:58:40] Living Word to hold to the church when
[1:58:43] Eve put a
[1:58:45] question upon the word whether God would
[1:58:49] keep his word whether he would punish or
[1:58:51] not
[1:58:53] Satan put a question and Eve believed
[1:58:57] it so putting a question on God's word
[1:59:02] has produced a hybrid therefore a dead
[1:59:07] religion and dead
[1:59:10] children and then when the church he
[1:59:14] says puts the question upon the word is
[1:59:17] he the
[1:59:18] same does he still live in his church
[1:59:21] and perform his signs and miracles that
[1:59:23] he did when he was here on the earth
[1:59:26] which he so surely promised us in John
[1:59:29] 14:12 he that believeth on me the works
[1:59:32] that I do shall he do also and even
[1:59:34] greater than this shall he do for I go
[1:59:35] to my father these signs of all them
[1:59:38] that believe shall follow them the
[1:59:40] question is to the people today does he
[1:59:44] really mean
[1:59:46] it and when you accept what the church
[1:59:49] says does he really mean it then you put
[1:59:52] yourself in the same condition that e
[1:59:55] that Adam did and join yourself with the
[1:59:57] woman of the Church of this world and
[1:59:59] separate yourself from the blessings
[2:00:01] that God has promised to every believer
[2:00:04] that would separate himself from the
[2:00:07] world to the word now that's the
[2:00:12] truth and when we
[2:00:16] separate when we separate from the
[2:00:18] blessings of God then we have a religion
[2:00:21] with without
[2:00:23] power this is where brother Bram said in
[2:00:26] the message pardon he said God hates a
[2:00:29] powerless
[2:00:31] religion it's got to be power certainly
[2:00:34] it's a power to save a man from sin it's
[2:00:37] a power that can do signs and wonders
[2:00:39] and miracles as Jesus Christ promised
[2:00:42] they've zeroed in on the word of God
[2:00:45] back there and believed and they hit the
[2:00:47] target you zero the same way on the word
[2:00:50] of God it'll hit the target again it's
[2:00:52] got to because he's the same yesterday
[2:00:54] today and
[2:00:56] forever and this is what he's preaching
[2:00:58] about that in those messages there he
[2:01:01] there a great sermon I wish you'd go
[2:01:04] listen to it called
[2:01:05] look oh I remember one day coming out of
[2:01:09] a Revival
[2:01:11] meeting where I preached and I don't
[2:01:13] even remember where but I was coming
[2:01:14] back on the plane and I pulled out the
[2:01:17] little message
[2:01:18] look and as I read it I began to just
[2:01:22] weep and cry as I as I rejoice in that
[2:01:27] word
[2:01:28] look
[2:01:30] refocus and he says like a camera you
[2:01:32] look out there and then you you look
[2:01:35] through this camera binoculars and you
[2:01:37] see three deer he said but if you focus
[2:01:40] it it'll come down to one and he said
[2:01:43] that's with the word of God if it's out
[2:01:45] of focus you'll have three in the
[2:01:47] godhead if you focus it right it'll all
[2:01:49] come into one
[2:01:53] are you with
[2:01:54] me it's an hour and a time to
[2:01:58] refocus I don't know if you caught it or
[2:02:00] not but that's what God was telling us
[2:02:03] through his servant brother Murphy look
[2:02:06] Focus again look again God doesn't like
[2:02:11] a powerless
[2:02:12] religion God does not want that God
[2:02:15] wants to perform he wants to show
[2:02:17] himself alive our very hopes is a
[2:02:20] resurrection is our right our hopes of
[2:02:23] life is Resurrection the resurrection of
[2:02:25] Christ you see God wants to work in his
[2:02:28] church Jesus said I'll be with you
[2:02:30] always even to the end of the world the
[2:02:32] works that I do shall you do also St
[2:02:35] John
[2:02:36] 14:12 uh and even more than this shall
[2:02:39] you do for I go to my father and now the
[2:02:41] church tries to deny that get away to be
[2:02:44] more to get more members to be more
[2:02:47] popular now I want to ask you something
[2:02:50] the God is TR trying to perform in his
[2:02:54] church and the church is trying to
[2:02:57] perform by the Creed and the two can't
[2:03:00] work together you got to get rid of the
[2:03:03] Creed and get Christ
[2:03:06] in and how can you do it when he sees
[2:03:09] the blood when the blood has been
[2:03:10] applied with a sincere heart and a hand
[2:03:13] laid Upon Jesus Christ and a heart
[2:03:15] that's true before God to confess his
[2:03:17] wrong and be born of the Holy Spirit
[2:03:19] then the works of God would follow as he
[2:03:22] said it would do yes Church wants to
[2:03:25] perform to their Creeds to see how many
[2:03:27] members they can get but God wants to
[2:03:33] perform through the power of the blood
[2:03:36] to cre get Christians born
[2:03:39] again now God is sending out his last
[2:03:49] call his last voice
[2:03:52] his last
[2:03:54] prophecy Revelation chapter
[2:03:57] 10 tells after the coming of the mighty
[2:04:00] Angel which is
[2:04:02] Christ and he will cry with a loud voice
[2:04:05] or he will shout he'll bring a great
[2:04:08] message seven Thunders would be revealed
[2:04:11] there would be the Mysteries contained
[2:04:12] in the Seven
[2:04:16] Seals and in the days of the voice of
[2:04:19] the seventh angel when he sounds his
[2:04:20] message that mystery would be
[2:04:22] finished it would be the Capstone of the
[2:04:25] Mysteries it would be the final thing
[2:04:26] the final thing needed to add to the
[2:04:29] church would be the voice of God that
[2:04:31] would open up the entire Bible to us not
[2:04:35] make the Bible a new Bible in the sense
[2:04:37] that we have new
[2:04:39] doctrines but make the Bible new or
[2:04:41] fresh again because we are focused now
[2:04:44] no longer looking through the glasses of
[2:04:47] denomination
[2:04:52] and so then in verse then it comes down
[2:04:55] to the end there and he says the same
[2:04:58] Angel continues on saying take the book
[2:05:02] and eat it and thou must prophesy again
[2:05:05] so there must be a final voice to the
[2:05:08] final age and the bride and her
[2:05:11] messenger is the final voice to the
[2:05:15] final age let me tell you she is given
[2:05:19] voice to the Archangel so there for the
[2:05:22] voice of the
[2:05:24] Archangel I can get down to it and I
[2:05:27] won't get time to do it this morning I
[2:05:29] was hoping
[2:05:30] to but the Holy Spirit pulling me this
[2:05:33] way and that way for this service this
[2:05:36] morning I'm not and I've got to but I'll
[2:05:39] have to bring it another time but this
[2:05:41] bride will call the resurrection
[2:05:54] so the final prophecy is
[2:06:00] here and we she will prophesy
[2:06:04] again I just Echo what the prophet
[2:06:07] said but it'll be more than
[2:06:10] that she will actually prophesy
[2:06:16] again completing the scripture of Joel
[2:06:19] chapter
[2:06:20] 2 thy Sons and Daughters shall prophesy
[2:06:24] as I pour out my spirit on All
[2:06:28] Flesh so even as the original prophecy
[2:06:31] went forth in Acts
[2:06:33] two so would it be completed now in this
[2:06:36] last day as she prophesies
[2:06:40] again
[2:06:42] now God is making his last
[2:06:47] call now for somebody might be your last
[2:06:51] call this morning you don't even have a
[2:06:54] hope for
[2:06:56] tomorrow and if you're not a child of
[2:06:58] God you're not a Christian you don't
[2:06:59] have a hope for
[2:07:05] eternity but let me just
[2:07:08] say in the Bible God made Jesus said the
[2:07:12] Kingdom of Heaven is lik UN to a King
[2:07:16] who set out a banquet for his son would
[2:07:19] be a a marriage of his son son and the
[2:07:22] invited
[2:07:25] guest and he made a
[2:07:28] call and it was treated
[2:07:31] frivolously I'm too
[2:07:34] busy this isn't important
[2:07:38] enough what to be a part of the marriage
[2:07:44] supper do you realize what you're
[2:07:46] turning
[2:07:48] down this is worse than Miss Obama not
[2:07:51] going Trump's
[2:07:58] inauguration I honestly they won't miss
[2:08:02] her but let me just tell you on the
[2:08:05] other hand this is an invitation given
[2:08:08] to to the marriage supper of the
[2:08:12] lamb and God sent a call for the
[2:08:16] marriage supper of Li and they made
[2:08:19] excuses
[2:08:21] oh I married a
[2:08:23] wife too busy with
[2:08:26] life well you know if you have married a
[2:08:29] the right wife she'd be coming with
[2:08:34] you she'd also be invited so what what
[2:08:38] happened when you went out and God
[2:08:39] didn't work out too good did
[2:08:42] it a lot of things don't work out real
[2:08:44] good when you don't walking god's
[2:08:48] will God's got a word you you you can
