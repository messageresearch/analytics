[48:45] ourselves to you now in Jesus name amen
[48:49] amen God bless you this morning and it
[48:52] good to be in the house of God together
[48:54] man if you have your Bibles and you'd
[48:56] turn with me this morning to Psalm 62
[49:00] and5 Psalm 62 and5 we're going to read a
[49:03] few verses there and then also Psalm 78
[49:06] and
[49:07] 40
[49:10] amen amen God's good to us isn't he amen
[49:15] amen it says here in Psalm 62
[49:18] and5 my soul wait thou only upon God for
[49:24] my expectation is from him
[49:27] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[49:30] is my Deliverance I shall not be moved
[49:33] and God is my salvation and my glory the
[49:36] rock of my strength and my refuge is in
[49:40] God Amen and we're also going to look in
[49:43] chapter 78: 40 here it
[49:46] says how of did they provoke him in the
[49:50] wilderness and grieve him in the desert
[49:53] yay they turned back and tempted God
[49:57] and limited the Holy One of Israel amen
[50:01] I pray the Lord will add His blessings
[50:02] to the word as we have our seats this
[50:05] morning amen you know expectations
[50:10] looking there at the word they limited
[50:12] limited the Holy One of Israel and they
[50:15] limited him in their expectations of
[50:17] what he would do for them expectations
[50:20] are are a very powerful thing whether it
[50:23] be in our in our natural life or or or
[50:27] whether it be in our spiritual life
[50:28] because your own expectations of
[50:31] yourself and what is possible for
[50:34] yourself is actually what limits you the
[50:36] most I believe it was Henry Ford who
[50:39] said whether you believe you can or
[50:42] whether you believe you can't you are
[50:44] correct so it's it's the expectation
[50:47] that you set for yourself the same thing
[50:49] applies in the spiritual brother Bram
[50:51] says but expectancy that's a great thing
[50:55] to expect something you usually get what
[50:58] you expect some people come to the
[51:01] meeting and say well I I didn't expect
[51:03] to get anything out of it well they
[51:05] won't but those who expect to get
[51:08] something God will give them their
[51:11] expectations if they're doing it
[51:13] reverently and in the fear of God Amen
[51:17] so so our expectations are so important
[51:20] because our lives will only manifest to
[51:22] the level of our expectations you'll
[51:25] never go beyond your own expectations
[51:28] and so I I want to speak to that today
[51:30] you see the title there the
[51:31] manifestation of expectation the
[51:34] manifestation of expectation and and and
[51:37] we live in a very as you know a very
[51:40] cynical World a very negative world a
[51:43] world that teaches us to expect the
[51:45] worst that it's always going to go bad a
[51:47] world of Doubt or of fear and and and of
[51:50] unbelief and and we have to keep our
[51:53] guard up at all times because if we
[51:54] aren't careful the attitude of the world
[51:57] will begin to erode our own attitude the
[52:00] attitude of the world will begin eroding
[52:03] our right mental attitude it'll begin to
[52:06] erode the proper expectations and they
[52:08] begin to become eroded away and the and
[52:10] the stress of this world the the evil of
[52:13] this world the negativity of this world
[52:15] begins to wear on us and if you walk
[52:18] through the world very often and you
[52:20] live in it and you work in it sometimes
[52:21] you just feel heavy you just feel like
[52:24] it's wearing on you and sometimes your
[52:25] faith feels weaker than others why is
[52:27] that it's the world that's eroding at
[52:30] your right mental attitude it it's
[52:32] eroding at at your expectations and so
[52:36] you get to the point to where you stop
[52:38] expecting good things and so what
[52:41] happens is you stop seeing good things
[52:44] you stop expecting good and so you stop
[52:47] receiving good and and we stop looking
[52:49] for blessings so we stop getting
[52:52] blessings because you get what it is
[52:55] that you expect and soon we begin to
[52:57] expect the
[52:59] negative I've been very guilty of this
[53:02] myself many times I I'll hear my kids
[53:04] say something like this and I and I'll
[53:06] realize they got that from
[53:08] me because I I I've said things like
[53:10] well that
[53:13] figures of of course why wouldn't that
[53:16] have
[53:17] happened this always happens to me
[53:20] there's been times where things happen
[53:22] and I'll tell idy I'll say well welcome
[53:23] to my
[53:25] life I was saying that Friday when I was
[53:28] crawling around under my house after a
[53:29] sewer pipe busted well of course it did
[53:33] why wouldn't it happen and I had to
[53:36] fight to keep myself with a right mental
[53:39] attitude it wasn't the easiest thing to
[53:41] do but it it's something that we have to
[53:43] fight to keep the right frame of mind
[53:46] amen because the world around us or else
[53:48] the homes we were raised in or the way
[53:51] we're wired or the pressure that we're
[53:53] under has conditioned us to have a resp
[53:56] that certain negative response to trials
[53:59] and tribulations and and really just
[54:01] meaningless incidents of life that's
[54:04] really all it is and we get that
[54:05] response well of course as if that's
[54:08] actually what we were expecting to
[54:09] happen we were expecting it to go bad
[54:12] but listen Christians have bad days
[54:15] too Christians spill coffee on
[54:18] themselves on the way to work too
[54:20] Christian sewer pipes bust too or as
[54:24] brother Tim used to say Christians have
[54:26] flat tires too they're just natural
[54:29] things in life brother brandham would
[54:31] say persecution and trials are a natural
[54:35] normal part of the Christian Life
[54:38] there's only one thing you can do about
[54:40] them commit them to God just put it in
[54:44] God's hand the situation you're in the
[54:46] trial you're in the circumstance today
[54:48] I'm just going to commit it to God and
[54:50] let him have it because worrying about
[54:52] it is not going to do one thing having a
[54:56] attitude about it is not going to fix
[54:59] one thing listen in case you didn't know
[55:01] but I'm sure you did life is not perfect
[55:04] that's right life is difficult and we
[55:07] have to work to keep our attitudes right
[55:10] we have to work to keep our expectations
[55:12] right because if we're going to fulfill
[55:14] all that we're called to fulfill if
[55:17] we're going to be the bride in the last
[55:19] day if we're the final voice to the
[55:21] final age if we're going to manifest the
[55:24] life of Jesus Christ and the ministry of
[55:26] Jesus Christ on the Earth again we're
[55:28] not going to do it with a negative
[55:29] attitude or with lowered and misplaced
[55:33] expectations our expectations should be
[55:36] up here every day of our life I'm a son
[55:39] or a daughter of God I'm gathering
[55:41] together today to worship the most high
[55:43] God I know he's going to move in my life
[55:45] today I'm blessed today I'm blessed in
[55:47] the city I'm blessed in the field I'm
[55:49] blessed when I'm going I'm blessed when
[55:51] I'm coming I am a Son of God I'm
[55:54] expecting great things today
[55:57] let's raise our expectations
[56:00] today we have heard the the quote that
[56:03] the right mental attitude towards any
[56:05] promise of God will bring it to
[56:08] pass well I A lot of times until
[56:11] recently I didn't realize even myself
[56:14] this isn't an isolated
[56:15] quote he said this exact line 59 times
[56:20] throughout the
[56:21] message 59 times he says the right
[56:24] mental attitude towards any promise of
[56:27] God will bring it to pass well what is
[56:31] the right mental
[56:32] attitude well I guess we could we could
[56:34] also say the right
[56:36] expectations because the right mental
[56:38] attitude is an attitude that matches the
[56:41] word of God am brother and what are the
[56:44] right expectations expectations that
[56:47] match the word of God he said it that
[56:52] settles it my symptoms are worse today
[56:55] he said it that settles it my son's gone
[56:57] further away today he said it that
[57:00] settles it so if you get it to match the
[57:03] word of God then the circumstances no
[57:05] longer matter the symptoms no longer
[57:07] matter the current condition doesn't
[57:09] matter he said it that finish it he said
[57:12] it's finished it's finished he said it's
[57:15] over it's over he said by Stripes I'm
[57:17] Healed I'm Healed let my attitude match
[57:21] the word let my expectation today match
[57:24] the word his promises are true his
[57:27] promises are real all the promises of
[57:30] God in him are yay and in him amen I am
[57:33] a child of God therefore the promises
[57:35] that are true are my promises they're
[57:38] for me today they're for my family today
[57:41] therefore these are my expectations I'm
[57:44] going to receive today what I have need
[57:46] of God's going to move for me today I'm
[57:48] going to be healed today I'm going to be
[57:50] blessed in this service today God's
[57:53] going to show up today that's our
[57:57] expectation and then let that
[58:00] expectation begin to manifest in our
[58:03] lives
[58:04] amen besides what do you get with a
[58:06] negative
[58:08] attitude what do you get when you expect
[58:10] nothing from God what do you get when
[58:13] you confess the negative when when you
[58:16] give voice to the pressures of and the
[58:18] frustrations and the circumstances of
[58:19] life you get nothing or you get
[58:24] worse uh and I realize this ain't one of
[58:27] those tried for 30 days and if you don't
[58:29] like it send it back for free but I do
[58:30] want to say just give God a try one time
[58:34] just one time give him your absolute
[58:36] everything not one foot in one foot out
[58:38] because if you're halfway in you're
[58:40] going to end up all the way out but for
[58:42] once in your life give him your
[58:44] everything give him a try one time pour
[58:47] everything you got into and say God I'm
[58:50] expecting you to meet me I'm expecting
[58:53] you to do the exceeding abundantly I'm
[58:55] expecting you to move in my family I'm
[58:58] giving you my
[59:00] everything
[59:01] Hallelujah we can't allow this world and
[59:04] and and the situations and the
[59:06] circumstances to change our
[59:11] expectations amen and and and and I will
[59:14] say this if we've allowed it through
[59:16] trial or tribulation or hardship because
[59:18] when we go through rough
[59:20] patches I'm real I understand we go
[59:22] through rough times and if we've allowed
[59:25] that to Tamper down our expectations or
[59:28] get us focused then today let's line
[59:30] those expectations back up with the word
[59:33] the Lord's wanting you to know today I'm
[59:34] going to do it I'm going to do it what
[59:38] you've been asking for I'm going to do
[59:39] it just bring your expectations back in
[59:42] line with the word of God
[59:44] today
[59:46] Hallelujah church I'm not just hoping so
[59:49] I'm not just wishing I'm not just trying
[59:52] to get by I'm not just trying for us to
[59:55] have a good church and a good life and
[59:56] some good Services I'm expecting the
[59:59] Messiah I'm expecting the coming of the
[1:00:01] Lord I'm expecting a body change I'm
[1:00:04] expecting a Rapture I don't care what
[1:00:07] the circumstances are it looks worse
[1:00:10] than ever people are falling away this
[1:00:12] one's off the word don't matter
[1:00:14] circumstances he said I will have a
[1:00:17] bride without spot a wrinkle he said
[1:00:19] there be a Rapture he said it I expect
[1:00:22] it that settles it let that manifest out
[1:00:26] of our
[1:00:28] lives he says you can take over the
[1:00:31] circumstance tonight if you wish to oh
[1:00:35] my but there in the circum say take it
[1:00:38] over how do I do that the
[1:00:42] word God said so you can take over and
[1:00:45] control every disease that's in this
[1:00:47] body God said so he did it and God will
[1:00:50] do it again when he gives a promise
[1:00:53] he'll stand by I want to Echo that have
[1:00:55] you seen him do it he'll do it again
[1:00:58] he's seen him do it he'll do it again he
[1:01:01] gave the promise he'll stand by it today
[1:01:04] that's the expectation of the
[1:01:06] believer because God's word is not
[1:01:09] subject to
[1:01:10] circumstance and God's word in you is
[1:01:13] not subject to
[1:01:15] circumstance it isn't subject to time
[1:01:18] nor is it subject to the times that we
[1:01:20] live
[1:01:21] in listen I still expect us I still
[1:01:25] expect the Church of the Living God to
[1:01:27] be another book of Acts I'm not
[1:01:29] expecting us to just settle down and and
[1:01:32] ride the little Lazy River all the way
[1:01:33] to a Rapture Day I don't care if there's
[1:01:35] Rapids I don't care if there's storms I
[1:01:38] don't care who turns their back we're
[1:01:40] going to be perform the works of Jesus
[1:01:42] Christ the acts of the Holy Spirit are
[1:01:44] going to be in the body I still expect
[1:01:47] it
[1:01:48] today microphone didn't expect that
[1:02:07] work I can't hang mine under there like
[1:02:09] brother Tim and Timothy and brother Joe
[1:02:12] I'll be walking all over it back
[1:02:15] here
[1:02:23] yeah that's right we still expect the
[1:02:25] super Supernatural here I'm still
[1:02:27] expecting the Supernatural and But as
[1:02:30] time goes on and the longer we stay here
[1:02:33] and the longer it's been since the
[1:02:34] message was
[1:02:36] given then the enemy is going to try to
[1:02:38] get you get us to settle into just
[1:02:40] having
[1:02:41] Church let's just say you're in the
[1:02:43] message just just accept the word just
[1:02:45] just have church just be a good group
[1:02:48] accept the status quo as it were and and
[1:02:51] and the longer that you're sick the more
[1:02:53] deals that he's going to offer you
[1:02:56] because the longer that that your
[1:02:58] situation persists the more the devil
[1:03:00] tries to sway your
[1:03:02] expectation you've been sick six months
[1:03:05] you've been sick four years so he begins
[1:03:09] to offer you deals and the worst the
[1:03:11] diagnosis is the more fear he tries to
[1:03:13] get you to accept the longer your
[1:03:15] children are away from God the harder he
[1:03:17] tries to get you to back off the promise
[1:03:20] the longer the age last the more he
[1:03:22] tries to get you to settle maybe it's
[1:03:24] just not going to happen in my day
[1:03:27] listen if I'm 80 and on my deathbed
[1:03:30] Jesus is coming if I'm dying with
[1:03:32] sickness Jesus Is My Healer if my
[1:03:34] children are way way way far out there
[1:03:36] Jesus is the savior amen listen if my
[1:03:39] kids are out there today and they've
[1:03:41] been out there 25 years I'm still
[1:03:43] looking down that dusty road today I
[1:03:45] still got the fatted calf ready I got
[1:03:47] the best robe hanging up waiting to put
[1:03:49] on my children why I am expecting I'm
[1:03:54] not just hoping I'm I'm expecting
[1:03:58] them
[1:04:00] Hallelujah the Bible says here in Luke
[1:04:03] 15:20 and he arose and came to his
[1:04:05] father but when he was yet a great way
[1:04:07] off his father saw him

[1:04:14] expecting him that day despite the
[1:04:16] circumstances he was still under
[1:04:20] expectation brother Brown says it's only
[1:04:22] those who look for him shall see him
[1:04:25] it's it's only those who believe in him

[1:05:42] in
[1:05:44] myself my expectations are not in myself
[1:05:47] my expectations are in him my

[1:06:18] that you can count on him to bring his
[1:06:20] promises to pass quit worrying this
[1:06:23] morning quit trying to do it all by
[1:06:25] yourself and listen God doesn't need you
[1:06:28] to do anything but
[1:06:32] believe God doesn't need you to do
[1:06:35] anything but
[1:06:37] believe and let him work on the
[1:06:40] situation God let Abraham let all his
[1:06:43] abilities
[1:06:45] die God let Sarah get to 90 years old
[1:06:48] why God was going to do it not Abraham
[1:06:52] and say he just needed them to believe
[1:06:54] that's God was going to do it it was
[1:06:56] going to be a body change it was going
[1:06:57] to be a
[1:06:59] visitation God told the children of
[1:07:01] Israel March around
[1:07:02] Jericho and on the seventh day do it
[1:07:05] seven times and then shout and then blow
[1:07:08] the trumpet and then shout and then the
[1:07:09] walls was going to fall down why such a
[1:07:13] seemingly silly
[1:07:16] plan because he wanted them to know this
[1:07:18] ain't your might this ain't your power
[1:07:21] you can't conquer Jericho but that's
[1:07:23] okay I'm the captain of the Lord's host
[1:07:26] and I'm going to tear those walls down
[1:07:28] you just make sure you shout when it's
[1:07:30] time to shout isn't it something there
[1:07:32] was a trap Soul on the inside of there
[1:07:34] that couldn't get out but when the shout
[1:07:36] came forth when the praise went forth
[1:07:38] when the atmosphere got right her walls
[1:07:41] fell down and she was able to walk out a
[1:07:43] free person don't tell me worship don't
[1:07:46] matter don't tell me praise don't matter
[1:07:48] when the trumpet goes forth when the
[1:07:50] word Goes Forth then you shout and watch
[1:07:53] the walls come down
[1:07:56] he was letting them know it's my power
[1:07:59] I'm the one going to do
[1:08:02] this God's going to let it get down to
[1:08:05] where we realize we can't do
[1:08:07] this and we say God I'm just going to
[1:08:09] trust you and he says
[1:08:13] finally I'm just going to trust you I'm
[1:08:16] just going to believe in you quit

[1:08:22] move ishmail was a product of
[1:08:28] worry how's he GNA do it I just it just

[1:08:34] this is the
[1:08:35] way do do go go this way ishmail was the
[1:08:39] product of worry he was the product of
[1:08:41] humans trying to help God out the
[1:08:43] product of humans trying to figure it
[1:08:45] out am listen God is in control of this
[1:08:51] brother Aon what's this whatever you

[1:09:04] that looks too big for you Jericho's
[1:09:06] walls were too big for the children of

[1:09:10] situation just commit it to him today

[1:09:31] pass not a single promise has ever been
[1:09:33] brought to pass by worry but the right
[1:09:35] attitude the right expectation will
[1:09:38] manifest God's word every single time so
[1:09:41] what should our expectations be how high
[1:09:45] should they be listen don't set your
[1:09:46] expectations uh lower than anything
[1:09:48] other than total Victory lower than
[1:09:51] anything other than than than than
[1:09:53] crossing over into the promised land to
[1:09:55] obtaining the promise that God has given
[1:09:57] you because you're going to be given
[1:09:58] opportunities to stop
[1:10:02] short you're going to be given
[1:10:04] opportunities to go back there's going
[1:10:07] to be captains rise up that say this is
[1:10:09] far enough on there's going to be
[1:10:11] captains rise up and say we don't need
[1:10:13] the supernatural right we don't need the
[1:10:15] moving of God you don't have to get the
[1:10:17] Holy Ghost the way they used to God
[1:10:20] don't do that there's going to be
[1:10:21] captains that offer you and say look you
[1:10:23] came out of Egypt so you're okay
[1:10:26] you're going to be given opportunities
[1:10:28] to stop short opportunities to make
[1:10:31] peace opportunities to make a
[1:10:33] deal look Pharaoh's offer to them was
[1:10:38] based on
[1:10:39] Circumstance the fact that they were
[1:10:42] slaves and he says you can take these
[1:10:46] people but you got to leave some people
[1:10:50] you can go so far in worship but you
[1:10:53] can't go all the way you can have these
[1:10:57] blessings but you got to give up your
[1:10:59] peace you can have this blessing but I'm
[1:11:02] not going to let you have your joy I'll
[1:11:05] let you believe the message but the new
[1:11:08] birth isn't like it used to
[1:11:10] be and if you don't have the right
[1:11:14] expectation then the offers don't look
[1:11:16] so
[1:11:18] bad if your expectation is here and the
[1:11:22] offer is there well then you've receed
[1:11:25] what you were
[1:11:26] wanting but if your expectation is here
[1:11:30] and somebody offers you this let me just
[1:11:33] put it to you and use car terms brother
[1:11:36] Joe if you're expecting to get 10,000 on
[1:11:38] a car you're selling somebody offers you
[1:11:41] 1,500
[1:11:43] nope no no sir not
[1:11:47] today but if you're expecting
[1:11:50] 10,000 and somebody shows up and says
[1:11:53] how about 12
[1:11:56] and you're sitting there saying God pour
[1:11:58] it out Lord I'm exped and he says
[1:12:00] because you're expected I'm going to
[1:12:01] give you more than you even wanted I'm
[1:12:03] going to overflow your cup I found a
[1:12:04] heart that's believing I found a heart
[1:12:06] that's expected I'm not going to Short
[1:12:08] change them I'm not going to give them
[1:12:09] some kind of a Pharaoh's offer I'm going
[1:12:11] to say I'm going take you all the way
[1:12:12] and not only am I going to take you all
[1:12:14] the way I'm going provide for you all
[1:12:15] the way I'mma open the Red Sea I'm going
[1:12:17] give you Mana I'mma give you handfuls on
[1:12:20] purpose I'm going to heal you when the
[1:12:21] serpent bites I'm going to pour it out
[1:12:23] because there was some am Rams down
[1:12:25] there that was praying God send your
[1:12:27] deliver God it's time for a deliver I
[1:12:29] say there's people they saying God it's
[1:12:31] time for a Rapture it's time for our
[1:12:33] body change It's Time Lord for us to see
[1:12:36] you come back the way you said you would
[1:12:39] he's not going to Sure
[1:12:42] [Music]
[1:12:44] changes Pharaoh's offer played off a
[1:12:47] circumstance because of circumstance
[1:12:49] they didn't have high
[1:12:52] expectations I mean going a little way
[1:12:54] is better than going nowh where you
[1:12:55] ain't went nowhere in 400 years this is
[1:12:58] better than what you've been
[1:13:00] getting you're a slave you've been a
[1:13:03] slave and I'm actually offering you a
[1:13:05] good deal here but that good deal that

[1:13:09] to get you to the promised
[1:13:11] land it ain't going to get you through
[1:13:13] the Red Sea God said he was going to
[1:13:16] take them to a land flowing with milk
[1:13:19] and honey God said they could be totally
[1:13:22] free God said I'm the deliver I don't
[1:13:25] need no stinking deal from Pharaoh I am
[1:13:28] that I am and I have come down for your
[1:13:31] situation don't settle today with the

[1:13:45] the wilderness he brought us here to
[1:13:47] Rapture us he brought us here to take us
[1:13:50] to a place that he has prepared he
[1:13:52] brought us here so that we could go to
[1:13:53] the marriage supper of the L and Pharaoh
[1:13:55] says yep but you got to leave some
[1:13:57] behind and God says no you don't just
[1:14:00] eat the lamb we're all leaving here in
[1:14:02] the
[1:14:03] morning
[1:14:05] [Applause]
[1:14:09] Hallelujah God was wanting them to
[1:14:11] change their
[1:14:15] expectations he said I am that I

[1:14:27] way that they were constantly battling
[1:14:30] that slave
[1:14:32] mentality never experiencing truly
[1:14:35] freedom and every time something went
[1:14:37] wrong they would forget the
[1:14:39] promise every time something went wrong

[1:22:15] you to move for me I think it's going to
[1:22:17] happen today Lord
[1:22:19] Jesus he heals who he wants he saves who
[1:22:22] he wants that's right get your thinking
[1:22:25] and your reasoning out the way if God
[1:22:27] says he saves he saves God says he heals
[1:22:30] he heals if God says you can have it
[1:22:33] quit trying to explain to him why you're
[1:22:35] not good enough and why you're too bad
[1:22:37] and why you've gone too far God said you
[1:22:39] can have it then you can have
[1:22:42] [Applause]
[1:22:45] it I'll try to figure it all
[1:22:48] out Peter didn't try to figure it all
[1:22:50] out that night out on the boat he said
[1:22:53] bid me come Jesus said
[1:22:56] come and right that moment
[1:22:58] Peter launched into a speech about
[1:23:01] Archimedes
[1:23:02] principle and how it states that the
[1:23:04] upward force of an object in the fluid
[1:23:05] equal to the weight of the fluid that
[1:23:07] the object displaces and this upward
[1:23:09] force is what gives something the
[1:23:11] ability to
[1:23:13] float but you understand that humans
[1:23:15] can't walk on water because their weight
[1:23:17] is is too great to be supported by the
[1:23:18] surface tension of the water and that
[1:23:21] the water density is not a
[1:23:24] you laugh that sounds like some people
[1:23:26] that come up for
[1:23:27] prayer before you even get to pray for
[1:23:30] him like man you might as well go sit
[1:23:31] you f a
[1:23:36] sink no he said bid me come Jesus said
[1:23:40] Come Peter got out the boat today Jesus
[1:23:43] is saying come come and all I'm saying
[1:23:46] is get out your boat of Doubt get out
[1:23:47] your boat of unbel get out your boat of
[1:23:49] fear and expect to walk on the water
[1:23:52] today you're not going to sink you're
[1:23:54] not going to drown you're not going to
[1:23:56] fail oh and if you do begin to seink all
[1:23:58] you got to do say Jesus save me I perish
[1:24:02] and in that moment he will reach down
[1:24:04] and pull you up and you'll walk on water
[1:24:07] again listen it's been a while since
[1:24:09] some of you walked on water you've been
[1:24:11] sinking but today is a new day today
[1:24:13] we're going back to the boat the boat
[1:24:15] that Jesus Christ Capt us The Old Ship
[1:24:17] isign we're going to walk on water again
[1:24:20] get up get out your boat today
[1:24:25] hallelujah amen
[1:24:27] amen B me
[1:24:29] come he says come today there's
[1:24:33] salvation for you there's Mercy for you
[1:24:34] there's Grace for you there's healing
[1:24:37] for you just take him out his word it's
[1:24:40] time for our expectations to match the
[1:24:45] promise it's time for our expectations
[1:24:47] to match the promise but Israel limited
[1:24:50] God over over and over again and over
[1:24:52] time
[1:24:54] it became a part of who they
[1:24:57] were you watch a church limit the moving
[1:25:00] of God and over time it becomes a part
[1:25:02] of who they
[1:25:06] are they limited him and over time it
[1:25:09] became more about their Traditions than
[1:25:12] it did about God's
[1:25:13] power their Traditions didn't get them
[1:25:16] out of
[1:25:19] Egypt their Traditions didn't get them
[1:25:21] out of
[1:25:22] Babylon but it became more about about
[1:25:24] their Traditions than it did God's power
[1:25:26] it became more about their doctrines and
[1:25:28] their
[1:25:29] forms Church don't let that be
[1:25:34] us I am so thankful that the Mysteries
[1:25:37] are revealed I'm so thankful that we
[1:25:39] have correct doctrine that godhead is
[1:25:42] there and serpent say I'm so thankful
[1:25:43] for all that but if that becomes all you
[1:25:46] focus on and the sick sit sick and the
[1:25:49] lost sit lost and the bound sit
[1:25:52] undelivered then what good is your
[1:25:54] Doctrine doing
[1:26:00] you but it became about their traditions
[1:26:03] and their doctrines and their leaders
[1:26:05] and their teachers set the expectations
[1:26:09] low what God could do what God would do
[1:26:14] listen a lot of people don't go far
[1:26:15] enough because of the expectations that
[1:26:17] they're taught there's a lot of people
[1:26:19] would love to get out in deeper water
[1:26:24] but they're held by fear in a place and
[1:26:26] told that no no no no that water's
[1:26:28] fanaticism we that water we're supposed
[1:26:31] to be in this water you're supposed to
[1:26:33] live right here in the kitty
[1:26:37] pool but their expectations are taught
[1:26:39] to them over and over again and it's all
[1:26:43] they know it's not that they're not good
[1:26:44] people it's not they're not hungry
[1:26:46] people it's all they know it's all
[1:26:48] they've been taught that they don't
[1:26:49] expect more because the leaders and the
[1:26:51] teachers have set the standard so low
[1:26:54] hey I put it like this we set the
[1:26:56] standards and expectations too low in
[1:26:57] our
[1:26:59] homes hey I'm must going to say
[1:27:01] something from my own heart too many
[1:27:03] times our our prayers with our families
[1:27:05] are bedtime
[1:27:07] prayers how many times have our kids H
[1:27:10] us asking for great big things setting
[1:27:14] the standard and expectation really
[1:27:16] really
[1:27:19] high and I thought about it I was like
[1:27:21] yeah I've prayed with my kids for for
[1:27:23] years but how many times has it just
[1:27:25] been God watch over them tonight and God
[1:27:26] bless us and God thank you and those
[1:27:28] things are wonderful you should thank
[1:27:30] you watch over us put yourself but how
[1:27:32] many times have they heard you set the
[1:27:34] expectation at a level that only God
[1:27:36] could
[1:27:38] reach and then watch them come behind it
[1:27:40] and back it up so then they go forward
[1:27:42] with their own high
[1:27:46] expectations we like to place the
[1:27:48] traditions on on on the denominations
[1:27:51] and the churches but many of us carry
[1:27:53] the traditions of our
[1:27:55] family and it's hard to break traditions
[1:27:58] I realize do you know how hard it
[1:28:05] is to have a different view of a of a
[1:28:08] man of God or a Ministry if you're whole
[1:28:10] life you were raised being taught that
[1:28:11] he was wrong and in error and and off
[1:28:13] the word you know how hard it is for
[1:28:16] that man to then help you later in
[1:28:21] life based off of a family tradition
[1:28:24] based off what you talked about around
[1:28:26] the dinner
[1:28:27] table or do you know how hard it is to
[1:28:29] expect God to move for you in your
[1:28:31] situation if you were told that God
[1:28:33] don't move like that no
[1:28:35] more if you're told God don't heal what
[1:28:37] do you do when you get sick and the
[1:28:39] doctors say we can't help
[1:28:42] you how hard it is to get the New Birth
[1:28:45] when you were taught that you already
[1:28:46] had it because you accepted the
[1:28:50] message and what it is is it changes
[1:28:52] expectations
[1:28:54] and if our expectations aren't in the
[1:28:55] right place then we miss what's
[1:28:57] happening because we're not expecting
[1:29:01] it we're looking in the wrong places our
[1:29:04] expectations are low but traditions and
[1:29:06] and teachings look why is it so hard I
[1:29:09] I'll even say look we have the most
[1:29:11] wonderful congregation brother Joe but
[1:29:14] sometimes we got we got to be real why
[1:29:16] is it so hard even for some amongst us
[1:29:18] to recognize the move of God
[1:29:24] how can a a place literally be blowed
[1:29:28] apart and we don't move now what do you
[1:29:34] mean by that brother you saying I need
[1:29:35] to get out in the aisles and and dance
[1:29:37] because some young people were dancing
[1:29:38] or I need to speak in tongues or I need
[1:29:41] to shout no I don't care what you
[1:29:43] do but if the whole place is moved by
[1:29:45] the spirit of God and this is
[1:29:49] you something's wrong yes sir
[1:29:56] wrong with your
[1:29:59] soul not in your spirit and just this
[1:30:02] the way I am know something's wrong in
[1:30:04] your soul I'm not saying you have to do
[1:30:07] nothing but if the king passes by he's
[1:30:09] worthy of
[1:30:12] this he's worthy of a bowed head in
[1:30:14] prayer instead of gawking
[1:30:17] like why are they doing that again
[1:30:20] listen I've said it before and I'll say
[1:30:22] it again everybody ain't going to dance
[1:30:24] everybody ain't going to shout but when
[1:30:26] David said he wanted a drink of water
[1:30:28] from the whale the whole Army didn't go
[1:30:31] but there was three that said I will so
[1:30:34] if he comes through this place and he's
[1:30:35] thirsty for a dance somebody's going to
[1:30:37] give it to
[1:30:40] him and you know what those three
[1:30:42] weren't looked at and despised those
[1:30:43] three were honored because they gave the
[1:30:46] king a drink not there they go again
[1:30:49] going to get water for
[1:30:52] David but some of us why do we struggle
[1:30:55] and I've already explained this in the
[1:30:57] past few minutes I'm not knocking as
[1:31:00] much as I'm saying it's what you've been
[1:31:01] taught and it's your tradition we got to
[1:31:04] raise our expectations above our
[1:31:08] [Music]
[1:31:10] Traditions I don't ever want it to be
[1:31:12] thought that me or brother Tim or
[1:31:14] Timothy or brother Joe or any any real
[1:31:17] man of God teaching the word thinks that
[1:31:19] everybody's got a shout jump dance run
[1:31:22] not at all
[1:31:24] but when the king comes through he
[1:31:27] deserves your worship however that is
[1:31:31] that's all I'm saying he deserves your
[1:31:34] worship everybody's going to do that
[1:31:36] differently but to know he's in the
[1:31:38] building and to intentionally
[1:31:43] withhold because in those atmospheres
[1:31:46] the only way you cannot worship is to
[1:31:48] intentionally withhold that's not up for
[1:31:52] debate it's a choice I choose not
[1:31:57] to something's wrong with the
[1:32:02] soul why is it so hard to recognize the
[1:32:05] move of God because of the teachings of
[1:32:07] man because in the car ride on the way
[1:32:10] home we talk about that one person who
[1:32:12] always gets
[1:32:13] emotional and so in our mind that's all
[1:32:15] it
[1:32:16] is are the misplacement of scriptures or
[1:32:19] limiting God or lowering expectations
[1:32:21] why didn't they recognize Jesus when he
[1:32:24] came wrong expectations oh he's going to
[1:32:28] come as a king he's going to overthrow
[1:32:29] the Roman government he's going to do
[1:32:30] this he's going to come down to you know
[1:32:32] Caiaphas say and he was born in a barn
[1:32:35] and he was the prince of peace and he
[1:32:38] said turn the other cheek he said give
[1:32:40] unto Caesar what is Caesar's and like
[1:32:42] that ain't
[1:32:43] him because their expectations were
[1:32:46] wrong he didn't come according to their
[1:32:48] Traditions look I'm so thankful today
[1:32:50] for a prophet that took out look all of
[1:32:52] us would be looking in the wrong place
[1:32:54] this morning all of us would be focused
[1:32:56] on traditions this morning but he came
[1:32:58] and what he did was he turned our
[1:33:00] expectations back to the word of God he
[1:33:04] put our expectations right back aligned
[1:33:06] with the word and so today our
[1:33:08] expectations aren't aren't formed by
[1:33:10] generations of denominational ideas
[1:33:14] because that's what caused the Jews to
[1:33:15] miss him hundreds and hundreds and
[1:33:18] hundreds of years since a prophet had
[1:33:19] come and so it was their ideas and what
[1:33:21] they thought the prophecies were and
[1:33:24] they formed their own ideas the teachers
[1:33:27] of that day should have known
[1:33:32] him Israel was a covenant people just
[1:33:35] like
[1:33:37] us called chosen blessed and they were
[1:33:40] looking for the Messiah but with wrong
[1:33:44] expectations the scriptures spoke of him
[1:33:47] the prophets declared him they were
[1:33:49] wanting to see
[1:33:52] him but somewhere in the
[1:33:55] waiting somewhere in the time period
[1:33:59] between the prophets and the
[1:34:00] manifestation of of the word in a flesh
[1:34:02] body called Jesus somewhere in the
[1:34:05] studying and the teaching and the
[1:34:06] learning their expectations for what God
[1:34:08] would do and how God would act and how
[1:34:11] these scriptures would be fulfilled got
[1:34:14] twisted and they got off and it became
[1:34:17] intellectual it became learn about
[1:34:20] it and they weren't really looking for
[1:34:23] the m IAH anymore they were looking to
[1:34:26] continue living peacefully in their
[1:34:30] traditions and so I ask you are you
[1:34:34] looking for the Messiah
[1:34:38] still every day do you wake up and say
[1:34:41] Lord is this the day or you just looking
[1:34:44] to continue peacefully in your tradition
[1:34:47] as a message
[1:34:49] believer or are you looking for the
[1:34:52] coming of the Lord
[1:34:54] if we aren't looking for him guess what
[1:34:57] you won't see him if you're not looking
[1:34:59] for his coming you're going to miss his
[1:35:02] coming he says remember get this close
[1:35:05] now he only appears to those who are
[1:35:08] looking for him he only appears to those
[1:35:11] who are looking for him he didn't
[1:35:12] stutter he wanted to drive the point
[1:35:15] home makes himself known to those who
[1:35:18] are looking for
[1:35:22] him where did the Jews get away from the
[1:35:26] supernatural where did the message
[1:35:28] Community get away from the
[1:35:30] supernatural when did they quit
[1:35:32] expecting God to move these same people
[1:35:34] saw the Red Sea open they saw Jordan
[1:35:37] roll back they saw Jericho fall they'd
[1:35:39] seen move on their behalf Time After
[1:35:41] Time After Time but at some point they
[1:35:43] quit expecting God to move like
[1:35:46] that what are we talking about today we
[1:35:48] got to keep our expectations right we
[1:35:51] got to keep our expectations right
[1:35:54] the expectation isn't just good morals
[1:35:56] the expectation isn't just good homes
[1:35:58] and good churches today my expectation
[1:36:01] is the Holy Ghost today my expectation
[1:36:03] is that he's moving for me now that he's
[1:36:05] moving in my body now he's moving in my
[1:36:07] home now he's moving for my children now
[1:36:10] that the Rapture is at hand now the
[1:36:12] coming of the Lord is at hand now that's
[1:36:14] my
[1:36:15] expectation that's where my faith is and
[1:36:19] when he does show up in this service or
[1:36:21] in my home I want to recognize him
[1:36:24] I want to say that's him moving that's
[1:36:27] him moving right there I recognize
[1:36:31] it they should have recognized him but
[1:36:34] when he rode into
[1:36:36] Jerusalem and people got excited because
[1:36:39] they were looking for him they were
[1:36:41] expecting as a matter of fact they they
[1:36:43] had they were all gathered there at the
[1:36:46] gate there was rumors swirling that he
[1:36:48] was coming and they knew the prophecy
[1:36:51] that he would be on the CT and and they
[1:36:53] were looking and they were excited so
[1:36:55] when they saw it they begin to shout
[1:36:59] hosana they begin to lay down the the
[1:37:02] the robes and lay down the The Palms and
[1:37:04] they begin to dance and shout and scream
[1:37:07] Hosanna because they were expecting it
[1:37:10] and then there he
[1:37:13] was they were shouting and screaming and
[1:37:15] praising but the church leaders of the
[1:37:17] day said who is
[1:37:21] this is this just an emotional work up
[1:37:24] at their
[1:37:26] meetings who is
[1:37:28] this is that just the music making them
[1:37:31] do that who is
[1:37:34] this why they all snotting down at the
[1:37:37] altar who is
[1:37:40] this are they are they just in the
[1:37:43] flesh when they were the very ones who
[1:37:45] should have known who it
[1:37:48] was they knew the word so well and yet
[1:37:50] they couldn't see it when it was
[1:37:51] manifested because they were under false
[1:37:55] expectations brother Brown says and
[1:37:57] isn't it and it isn't changed any today
[1:38:01] because the holy spirit is forerunning
[1:38:03] the coming of the Lord Jesus and as the
[1:38:05] Holy Spirit begins to stretch out across
[1:38:07] the Earth Revival fires are broken out
[1:38:10] everywhere great signs and wonders has
[1:38:12] been done healings has took place
[1:38:14] prophecies has went forth all the
[1:38:16] Gatherings of the apostolic blessing has
[1:38:18] come back to the church again so as it
[1:38:21] was then so is it now the spirit of the
[1:38:23] unbeliever still cries out who is
[1:38:30] this when he moves in our church don't
[1:38:33] say who is
[1:38:37] this say I know who it
[1:38:40] is I know who it is Lord cuz I was
[1:38:43] expecting you to show up this morning I
[1:38:45] came knowing you going to move on my
[1:38:47] behalf this morning I came prayed up
[1:38:49] expecting to see you this morning Lord I
[1:38:51] know it's you I see it's you and I want
[1:38:53] to pray praise you cuz I'm expecting you
[1:38:55] to move in my family I'm expecting you
[1:38:57] to save my children I'm expecting you to
[1:38:59] restore this marriage I'm expecting an
[1:39:01] outpouring of the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:39:03] expecting a refilling of the Dynamics of
[1:39:06] the power of God in my life I see you
[1:39:08] Lord I recognize you Lord thank you
[1:39:11] Jesus for coming by our way this
[1:39:14] morning
[1:39:16] Hallelujah may we have our expectations
[1:39:18] right so that we always recognize him
[1:39:22] I'm thankful today for men of God who
[1:39:24] raise
[1:39:25] expectations men who don't lower them
[1:39:29] but who'll tell you that he's still the
[1:39:30] same today that he was yesterday that he
[1:39:33] still moves that he still feels that he
[1:39:35] still manifests amongst his people tells
[1:39:37] you you can overcome you are going to
[1:39:40] make
[1:39:42] it brother brandom says I haven't got
[1:39:44] much hopes for a pastor's church that
[1:39:46] hasn't got Ambitions to better
[1:39:48] themselves day by day and year by
[1:39:50] year a church that's really a church of
[1:39:53] the the Living God will never
[1:39:56] stop
[1:39:58] listen if you can't look back to where
[1:40:00] you were a year ago and dislike it it
[1:40:03] tells me you're still
[1:40:08] there a church that's really a Church of
[1:40:11] the Living God will never stop say well
[1:40:13] I just come in I guess it's all right
[1:40:15] now that ain't the Church of God he's
[1:40:17] got an ambition to press
[1:40:20] on brother that's not the ambition of
[1:40:22] the Church of God if he brings one he
[1:40:24] wants another and another and another
[1:40:26] and another there's no end to it just
[1:40:28] keep on climbing up see we want to have
[1:40:31] an ambition and expectations God wants
[1:40:34] us to be that way well every service
[1:40:38] can't be like why well every service
[1:40:41] ain't going to have a well sometimes

[1:40:55] I'm expecting to pour it out now just as
[1:40:56] great as any other service that we've
[1:40:59] ever had because our God isn't limited
[1:41:01] by circumstance by Time by people he
[1:41:04] said where two or three are gathered
[1:41:06] I'll be there in the midst and when he's
[1:41:08] there the miraculous happen the power of
[1:41:11] God's on this place the sick are healed
[1:41:13] the Lost are saved I'm expecting great
[1:41:17] things Hallelujah
[1:41:21] hallelu we don't need people in the pool
[1:41:23] pit telling you that you got to live
[1:41:24] with the
[1:41:25] devil that you must live with your issue
[1:41:28] and learn to cope with
[1:41:30] it lowering expectations that's what
[1:41:33] Saul did to
[1:41:34] David somebody finally got enough
[1:41:36] courage to go out and face the
[1:41:38] giant somebody finally got enough
[1:41:40] courage to get loose in the
[1:41:42] spirit to praise a little bit somebody
[1:41:46] finally expected God to back up his word
[1:41:48] somebody read Mark 16 before church and
[1:41:51] came to church fired up ready to see it
[1:41:53] in action cuz Mark 16 in action is the
[1:41:55] true church all else is
[1:41:59] false but then their preacher got up and
[1:42:02] said to David thou are not able to go
[1:42:08] against this
[1:42:11] Philistine thou are not able to get the
[1:42:14] Holy Ghost like they did in the book of
[1:42:16] Acts you are not able to be healed by
[1:42:19] the laying on of hands prayer lines do
[1:42:21] no good you are not able to see the
[1:42:23] gifts you are not able you listen you
[1:42:26] may not be able but don't tell me what
[1:42:29] I'm able I'm able to receive every
[1:42:32] blessing that God has given me I'm able
[1:42:34] to face any giant I got an expectation

[1:42:40] I've got expectations you can stay in
[1:42:42] the tent you can tell them you can't
[1:42:43] have it but I'm going into the valley

[1:42:52] coming down this morning Hallelujah you

[1:43:00] called to it I've been chosen for it I'm
[1:43:02] going out to battle to claim every
[1:43:05] promise of God this morning
[1:43:08] hallelujah
[1:43:12] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:43:14] Lord but we got too many captains

[1:47:08] look at circumstance or to look what's
[1:47:10] around you you are sure to fail but you
[1:47:13] must never look at what's going on
[1:47:17] around
[1:47:18] you because circumstances don't limit
[1:47:21] God but they limit our faith if we begin
[1:47:23] to focus on them but he is the god of
[1:47:26] circumstance this morning and I'm
[1:47:29] telling you not to let the things that
[1:47:30] you're seeing around you limit your
[1:47:32] expectations of this unlimited God why
[1:47:35] brother Aaron because God is God God is
[1:47:38] God you under attack today you find
[1:47:40] yourself in a valley today the stresses
[1:47:42] of Life Weighing on you today God is God
[1:47:45] your children are out of church God is
[1:47:46] God you find yourself down deep in the
[1:47:48] valley God is God you find yourself sick
[1:47:50] this morning God is God you find
[1:47:52] yourself de press God is
[1:47:55] God and he don't
[1:47:58] change he's God this morning you have
[1:48:01] limitations Your Heroes Have
[1:48:05] limitations God has no
[1:48:08] limitations and God and his people has
[1:48:10] no
[1:48:11] limitations my expectations today are
[1:48:14] the same in the valley as they are on
[1:48:16] the mountain you are going to go through
[1:48:20] valleys some of them deeper than others
[1:48:22] some of of them darker than others some
[1:48:24] of them harder than
[1:48:26] others but God's the same in the valley
[1:48:29] as he is in the
[1:48:31] mountain we're going to begin to turn
[1:48:32] this a little bit as we start heading
[1:48:34] towards home and I want to deal with the
[1:48:35] valley a little bit because remember
[1:48:38] circumstances when the devil get you
[1:48:39] down in the valley he likes to say see
[1:48:42] now where's your
[1:48:43] God see you served him all these years
[1:48:46] and you ended up in this Valley see
[1:48:48] you've tried so hard where's all your
[1:48:50] friends at now you're in this Valley
[1:48:51] alone
[1:48:54] whether it's true or not you know you
[1:48:55] feel that way sometimes that's you're
[1:48:58] fighting this alone you're by yourself
[1:49:01] let's make a
[1:49:03] deal I'll let you out of this Valley but
[1:49:05] you got to give me
[1:49:07] something I'll let you out of this
[1:49:09] Valley but you're going to give up
[1:49:13] something God doesn't have
[1:49:15] limitations God doesn't care where
[1:49:17] you're at this morning God's going to
[1:49:19] bring you Victory see the devil tries to
[1:49:22] get get you to limit God because of
[1:49:24] where you are but God is God of where
[1:49:27] you
[1:49:28] are what did the syrians say in First
[1:49:31] Kings 20 and
[1:49:32] 23 and the Servants of the king of Syria
[1:49:35] said unto him their gods are gods of the
[1:49:38] hills therefore they were stronger than
[1:49:42] us but let us fight against them in the
[1:49:45] plain and surely we shall be stronger
[1:49:50] than they what's the devil saying let
[1:49:52] get down in the valley let her get under
[1:49:55] this sickness let that family come under
[1:49:58] this attack let the stress of work
[1:50:00] really begin to pile up and let's attack
[1:50:02] when they're sick and when they're
[1:50:03] struggling then we'll overcome because
[1:50:06] see they're God they're really only
[1:50:07] strong when they're on the
[1:50:10] Mountaintop and the children of Israel
[1:50:12] were numbered and were all present and
[1:50:16] went against them and the children of
[1:50:18] Israel pitched before them like two
[1:50:20] little flocks of kids but the syrians
[1:50:24] filled the
[1:50:27] country when it looks hopeless I'm
[1:50:30] expecting God to
[1:50:31] move when I'm under attack I'm expecting
[1:50:35] God to move when I'm hurt and I see no
[1:50:38] way out I'm expecting God to
[1:50:42] move but see The syrians Limited God and
[1:50:47] he heard it and it angered
[1:50:51] him and there came a man of God and
[1:50:53] spake unto the king of Israel and said
[1:50:55] thus saith the Lord because the syrians
[1:50:57] have said the Lord is a god of the hills
[1:51:00] but he is not God Of The Valleys
[1:51:01] therefore will I deliver all this great
[1:51:04] multitude into thy hand and ye shall
[1:51:07] know that I am the Lord see he's not
[1:51:10] just the god of the mountains but he is
[1:51:11] the god of the M Valley he is the God of
[1:51:13] all of it so he's the god of your
[1:51:15] sickness this morning he's the god of
[1:51:16] your trial this morning he's the god of
[1:51:18] your circumstance he's the god of your
[1:51:20] situation the devil says I got him and
[1:51:22] God goes because you have limited me I'm
[1:51:25] going to destroy you under the feet of
[1:51:27] my bride that's a Son of God that's a
[1:51:30] child of God and he has a right
[1:51:32] footsteps or possession whether he's in
[1:51:34] the valley or whether he's on the
[1:51:35] mountain he is going to destroy you
[1:51:37] today because he is my son you have
[1:51:40] limited me you have said he couldn't
[1:51:42] overcome in this trial oh Hallelujah but
[1:51:45] there's victory in your Valley this
[1:51:48] morning amen he's the God of all of it
[1:51:52] and he will be victorious in all of it
[1:51:55] God heard
[1:51:56] it God heard it God's heard in this age
[1:52:00] as they said where is your God God's
[1:52:02] heard in this age as they said they
[1:52:04] can't take a Rapture from the valley of
[1:52:06] Leota they can't overcome in this
[1:52:09] Satan's Eden they can't overcome and God
[1:52:11] heard it and said thus sayith the Lord
[1:52:14] because you have said this that bride is
[1:52:16] going to overcome every devil she's
[1:52:18] going to conquer every situation she's
[1:52:20] going to take a body change and w
[1:52:22] capture right out of that Valley
[1:52:26] Hallelujah he says watch me they will be
[1:52:29] destroyed
[1:52:31] why because circumstances do not limit
[1:52:34] God he is God yes brother Aaron I'm in a
[1:52:39] valley this morning that's okay some of
[1:52:40] the greatest victories in the Bible came
[1:52:42] in
[1:52:46] valleys and these scriptures don't go I
[1:52:49] skipped some you'll notice just to get
[1:52:51] the story and and Saul and the men of
[1:52:53] Israel gathered together and pitched by
[1:52:55] the valley of Eli and set the battle
[1:52:58] array against the Philistines it's in a
[1:53:00] valley and it came to pass when the
[1:53:02] Philistine arose and came and Drew n to
[1:53:04] meet David that David hastened and ran
[1:53:06] toward the Army to meet the Philistine
[1:53:08] listen David was not afraid of the
[1:53:10] valley he knew that God was God on the
[1:53:11] hill he was God in the valley I'll kill
[1:53:14] that devil in the good times I'll kill
[1:53:15] that devil in the bad times I'll
[1:53:17] overcome when money's tight I'll
[1:53:19] overcome when I'm being blessed I'll
[1:53:20] overcome when I'm sick I'll overcome
[1:53:22] when I have health I will overcome
[1:53:24] because my God is the god of every
[1:53:26] circumstance and he hastened and ran
[1:53:29] towards the Army to meet the Philistine
[1:53:31] and the men of Israel and Judah arose
[1:53:34] and shouted and pursued the Philistines
[1:53:37] until they came to the valley and to the
[1:53:39] gates of erron what's David show here
[1:53:43] sometimes you got to go into the valley
[1:53:46] to get your
[1:53:49] Victory sometimes you're going to walk
[1:53:51] through a hard time to get your Victory
[1:53:54] and it's all for the glory of God but
[1:53:56] one thing's for sure you're not gonna
[1:53:58] get it staying where you're at saon
[1:54:01] proved that they'd been there for 40
[1:54:03] days and 40 nights and wasn't one step
[1:54:05] closer to
[1:54:06] Victory sometimes you got to go into the
[1:54:08] you know you we read the scripture in
[1:54:09] Psalms
[1:54:11] 23 and I know we don't look at it like
[1:54:13] this or refer to it like this but I was
[1:54:14] just thinking you know we usually use
[1:54:18] it as it refers to maybe funerals or or
[1:54:22] whatever
[1:54:23] but David was writing that from
[1:54:25] experience though I walk into the
[1:54:27] valley of the shadow of death you know
[1:54:30] how many men Goliath had killed yeah do
[1:54:33] you know how much death he had
[1:54:34] robed and and and I can just see David
[1:54:37] looking back
[1:54:38] thinking oh I didn't go to him in My Own
[1:54:41] Strength I didn't go to him but God went
[1:54:44] with me that's right I came to him in
[1:54:46] the name of the lord of the armies of
[1:54:48] Israel oh yes under inspiration do I
[1:54:50] walk into the valley of the shadow of
[1:54:53] death I will fear no evil there may be
[1:54:55] cancer in there I will fear no evil
[1:54:57] there may be diabetes in there I fear no
[1:54:59] there may be depression in there there
[1:55:01] may be every kind of demon of Torment in
[1:55:02] there and though I have to walk down
[1:55:04] into that Valley I will fear no evil for
[1:55:06] thou art with me oh Lord he wrote it
[1:55:09] from experience I believe we're a people
[1:55:11] that have experienced valleys and we've
[1:55:13] experienced that he's with us we've gone
[1:55:14] into the valley and we've come out with
[1:55:16] Victory I'm not afraid of a valley today
[1:55:19] my God is the god of the valleys he's
[1:55:21] the god god of the mountain he's a god
[1:55:23] of every situation
[1:55:26] Hallelujah Gideon then all the
[1:55:28] midianites and the amalekites and the
[1:55:30] children of the East were gathered
[1:55:31] together and went over and pitched in
[1:55:33] the valley of
[1:55:35] jezel and the midianites and the
[1:55:37] amalekites and all the children of the
[1:55:39] East lay along in the valley like
[1:55:41] grasshoppers for multitude and their
[1:55:43] camels were without number as the Sand
[1:55:47] by the Sea for
[1:55:49] multitude and the three companies blew
[1:55:51] the trumpets and break the pictures and
[1:55:53] held the lamps in their hands and the
[1:55:55] trumpets in their right hands to blow
[1:55:57] with all and they cried the sword of the
[1:55:59] Lord and Gideon and they stood every man
[1:56:02] in his place round about the camp and
[1:56:04] all the host ran and cried and fled
[1:56:08] where where was this victory at in your
[1:56:12] Valley outnumbered in a terrible
[1:56:15] situation with bad circumstances but the
[1:56:18] victory was in the valley Deborah
[1:56:20] defeated the Canaanites in the valley it
[1:56:22] elah slew the prophets of Baal in the
[1:56:24] valley of kesan it was in the valley
[1:56:27] that the dry bones came to
[1:56:29] life for the hand of the Lord was upon
[1:56:31] me and carried me out in the spirit of
[1:56:33] the Lord and set me down in the midst of
[1:56:35] the valley which was full of Bones so I
[1:56:37] prophesied as he commanded me and breath
[1:56:39] came into them and they lived and stood
[1:56:41] upon their feet an exceeding great
[1:56:45] Army I don't care where you're at today
[1:56:49] he is God and I expect to be victorious
[1:56:54] I expect him to move on my
[1:56:57] behalf
[1:56:58] Hallelujah the Jews have a saying that
[1:57:01] says the salvation of the Lord comes in
[1:57:03] the blink of an eye that's right that's
[1:57:06] all it
[1:57:07] takes the blink of an eye the salvation
[1:57:11] of the Lord comes in the blink of an eye
[1:57:13] let's raise our expectations knowing
[1:57:15] that any moment any blink of the eye
[1:57:18] Victory Is Ours raise our expectation to
[1:57:20] the level of the promise the Rapture is
[1:57:22] at hand in the blink of an eye in the
[1:57:24] moment in the twinkling of an eye the
[1:57:26] salvation of the Lord he's God when I'm
[1:57:29] on the mountain today he's God when I'm
[1:57:31] in the Valley he's God in my good days
[1:57:33] and he's God in my bad days what's it
[1:57:36] mean when it says the word of God will
[1:57:37] will overcome any place anywhere anytime
[1:57:39] under any situation I can whoop him when
[1:57:42] I'm sick I can whoop him when I'm
[1:57:43] healthy I can whoop him on the mountain
[1:57:45] I can whoop him in the valley the devil
[1:57:47] can't stand against a son or daughter of
[1:57:49] God when they take the word of God upon
[1:57:51] their lips it's good anywhere anytime
[1:57:54] any place in your situation
[1:57:58] today in the valley expect
[1:58:02] Victory I say let's be in the tent door
[1:58:04] this morning like Abraham looking for
[1:58:06] him expecting him let's expect this
[1:58:10] morning like the woman with the blood
[1:58:12] issue he says the woman with the blood
[1:58:14] issue was
[1:58:15] expecting If She Could Touch the Hem of
[1:58:18] His Garment it was over she wasn't
[1:58:21] hoping
[1:58:23] she was expecting when she touched the
[1:58:25] Hem of His Garment her
[1:58:28] expectations were
[1:58:30] fulfilled let's be like those wise men
[1:58:33] that saw his star because they were
[1:58:35] looking for him Church we're at the very
[1:58:37] coming of the Lord are we looking for
[1:58:39] him are we expecting to see him
[1:58:43] today but if you come expecting to be
[1:58:45] blessed God will see to
[1:58:47] it you'll get what you expect if you're
[1:58:50] expecting to be healed tonight you'll go
[1:58:52] home well that's just right if you're
[1:58:54] expecting it but first you've got to be
[1:58:56] under expectations you've got to believe
[1:58:58] it that's the reason no one seen the
[1:59:00] star in the days that it led the wise
[1:59:03] men but the wise men because they was
[1:59:04] expecting to see it they was watching
[1:59:07] for that star to rise and the prophet
[1:59:09] balam said that there'd be a star of
[1:59:11] Jacob arise and they were wise men
[1:59:13] astrologers and so forth they watched
[1:59:15] for that star they was watching for it
[1:59:17] that's the reason they seen it if you're
[1:59:19] watching to see the coming of the Lord
[1:59:21] no doubt but what yours
[1:59:26] said our
[1:59:28] expectations are going to be made
[1:59:32] manifest so
[1:59:34] today if your expectations were made
[1:59:37] manifest what would you
[1:59:41] get think about not your
[1:59:44] hopes what you're expecting if right now
[1:59:47] they were manifested if right now they
[1:59:48] came through that back door if right now
[1:59:50] it manifested in your body body what
[1:59:53] would you
[1:59:55] get think about it some people would get
[1:59:59] nothing but some people that have been
[2:00:01] looking for it I've been waiting for
[2:00:03] them back doors to open I've been
[2:00:05] waiting for somebody to sit down next to
[2:00:06] me I've been waiting for a sweep to come
[2:00:08] over my body I've been waiting for this
[2:00:10] I've been expecting this I knew it was
[2:00:12] coming I knew you were coming back I
[2:00:15] never had a doubt I knew it I was
[2:00:17] expecting it what would you get right
[2:00:20] now I say the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:00:22] would get everything she's looking she's
[2:00:25] longing she's expecting him to fulfill
[2:00:27] his word despite the
[2:00:31] circumstances
[2:00:33] Hallelujah I know we believe in the
[2:00:35] moving of the spirit here at evening
[2:00:37] light I know we believe in the
[2:00:39] Supernatural and the
[2:00:40] miraculous and we've seen great things
[2:00:43] and we and we've have we've had and we
[2:00:45] have great
[2:00:47] expectations but we can't get
[2:00:48] comfortable and settle down where we are
[2:00:52] no matter how much ground we've covered
[2:00:54] no matter how far we've come right there
[2:00:57] after Pentecost in the Ephesian
[2:00:59] age they knew the power of
[2:01:04] God they manifested the power of God
[2:01:08] they operated in the power of God but
[2:01:10] over time they begin to
[2:01:12] settle they began to get
[2:01:15] comfortable Jude could see it slipping
[2:01:17] and he cried out contend
[2:01:23] fight hold on to it don't let your
[2:01:27] expectations slip
[2:01:28] away they drifted and their expectations
[2:01:33] changed and what happens
[2:01:35] there is the next generation is raised
[2:01:39] with Lowered
[2:01:40] Expectations and they never see beyond
[2:01:43] that level that's
[2:01:45] right and then that becomes
[2:01:49] normal and then the next Generation
[2:01:51] comes up with Lowered
[2:01:56] Expectations and we never get to the
[2:02:00] place to where cold and formal become
[2:02:04] normal I'm fully aware brother Joe that
[2:02:07] not every service is going to go the
[2:02:08] same God moves differently there's times
[2:02:10] some of the most Mighty services are
[2:02:12] just
[2:02:13] solemn he's just dealing in your heart I
[2:02:15] understand
[2:02:17] that when I say the movement of the
[2:02:19] spirit don't always think that we mean
[2:02:20] one thing we mean the move of the spirit
[2:02:22] however he chooses that to
[2:02:25] be but don't let us go a few services
[2:02:29] without feeling his presence without
[2:02:31] going okay what's wrong Lord I need to
[2:02:33] be in prayer for this service Lord
[2:02:35] what's going on don't let that become
[2:02:36] normal to where it's just that you come
[2:02:37] it's the status quo we had church and we
[2:02:39] went home because that's what happened
[2:02:41] down Through the Ages as they drifted
[2:02:44] further and further and then the next
[2:02:46] group has even lower expectations and
[2:02:48] then that becomes normal and what ends
[2:02:50] up happening is it manifest
[2:02:52] and it manifests itself as cold as
[2:02:56] formal and
[2:02:58] Powerless and this morning like like
[2:03:00] Jude would say I'm crying out contend
[2:03:02] amen Lord's been good to us contend for
[2:03:05] it he's moved in our services contend
[2:03:07] for it expect it he's done it before
[2:03:09] Lord I want to see it again Lord I'm not
[2:03:11] going to sit back and say Lord I Thank
[2:03:13] you for every testimony but testimonies
[2:03:15] we get it mixed up sometime testimonies
[2:03:17] aren't there for us to always look back
[2:03:19] to testimonies are so we know what he's
[2:03:21] going to do he did it so he's going to
[2:03:23] do it he's done it before he's going to
[2:03:25] do it again those testimonies are so
[2:03:28] when we Face Goliath we can say he
[2:03:29] already took care of me when I fought a
[2:03:31] bear he already took care of me when I
[2:03:33] fought a line so today he's going to
[2:03:36] bring my giant down I'm not satisfied
[2:03:40] with the testimonies of the past but God
[2:03:42] I'm expecting more today and more
[2:03:44] tomorrow every time we come together I'm
[2:03:47] expecting I'm looking for him now I'm
[2:03:49] expecting him now
[2:03:53] Hallelujah so we can see we're back
[2:03:55] again to the same place and we find out
[2:03:58] expectations that God comes to those all
[2:04:02] through the scriptures it's been the
[2:04:03] same
[2:04:04] thing he always appears to those who are
[2:04:07] expecting him always to those who are
[2:04:10] wanting to see him church he ain't going
[2:04:14] to let this bride
[2:04:15] down amen he ain't going to fall short
[2:04:18] of those
[2:04:20] expectations oh they make made fun of
[2:04:22] that that little wash girl there in the
[2:04:26] story he's coming back for me she was
[2:04:28] expecting and they laughed listen let
[2:04:31] him laugh he ain't going to leave you
[2:04:34] there matter of fact if you listen real
[2:04:36] close I believe I hear Wagon Wheels
[2:04:37] coming right now I believe it's time to
[2:04:40] go put the dress on I believe you need
[2:04:42] to be dressing yourself in this word
[2:04:43] right now he's provided the material and
[2:04:45] he's coming back to get you and when he
[2:04:47] gets back he's not wanting you to have
[2:04:49] to go oh I got to go clean up real quick
[2:04:52] ain't going to be time for that he gave
[2:04:54] you the wedding garment a long time ago
[2:04:56] and he said I'm coming back when I show
[2:04:57] up be ready be dressed I say I'm
[2:04:59] expecting him to come back today Lord

[2:05:03] everything off of me that I don't need I
[2:05:05] want to please you Lord when you see me

[2:05:09] things I've held on to Lord Strip Me of
[2:05:11] them today and just let me be found
[2:05:13] dressed in the word of God CU I'm
[2:05:15] expecting you to come back any moment

[2:05:23] be disappointed their expectations have
[2:05:25] been brought back in line with the word
[2:05:27] of God and now their expectations are
[2:05:30] being made manifest I believe our
[2:05:32] expectations have been made manifest
[2:05:34] they expect God to move and when I say
[2:05:36] they you you expect God to move and he
[2:05:40] moves you expect God to heal and he
[2:05:42] heals you expect God to save and he does
[2:05:46] you expect to do the works that I do and
