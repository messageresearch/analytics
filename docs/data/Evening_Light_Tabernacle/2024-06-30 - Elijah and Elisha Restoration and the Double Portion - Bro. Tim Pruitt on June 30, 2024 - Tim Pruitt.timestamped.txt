[53:02] trick but she put out things like wheel

[53:08] different things like that and I'm sure
[53:10] your family got a hold of some of
[53:12] them um you know it it it was it was
[53:17] there that God would lead his family
[53:19] from the Church of Christ movement into
[53:22] the Full Gospel and then on into the
[53:24] message recognized God sending a prophet
[53:27] and and uh you know it it's it's
[53:32] moments you know that are like this that
[53:36] cement our faith together and sister
[53:38] Jeanie was in the prayer line and there
[53:42] just to show you the grace of God and
[53:45] the power of
[53:46] forgiveness that was a she knew nothing
[53:50] about it she was a Methodist girl and
[53:52] knew nothing
[53:54] about um anything to do with a prophet
[53:57] or message or and just kind of got
[54:00] introduced to it and taken to the
[54:02] meeting to see this prophet of God and
[54:05] got invited into a a prayer line got a
[54:08] prayer card and stood there in the
[54:11] prayer line
[54:12] and she had as a young girl had picked
[54:16] up the habit of slipping around
[54:19] smoking
[54:20] and about two or three ahead of her in

[58:48] want to take up something also for the
[58:51] Japan missions we have enough to um to
[58:55] take care of another um another six or
[58:59] eight more sermons of brother branham's
[59:01] there we started out in that country
[59:03] there was nothing in the Japanese
[59:05] language we now have um nearly 650
[59:10] sermons that have been translated into
[59:12] the Japanese language and we want to see
[59:16] um you know that con continued as we uh
[59:19] we see now there's a we have by God's
[59:22] grace there's a church there now in
[59:24] Japan several now smaller work workers
[59:26] works as well that are that are moving
[59:29] forward so um we want to encourage them
[59:33] by feeding them amen so uh if you'll

[59:42] Japanese offering you know and and send

[59:48] get the message translated and uh God
[59:50] has blessed us with that in a tremendous
[59:53] way with Google translate we get it
[59:55] translated just needs proofreading but
[59:57] it still takes some funds to get that
[59:59] done and and you remember on one of the
[1:00:02] trips over there God provided us a
[1:00:05] translator and uh we want to certainly
[1:00:08] make that um available for the Believers
[1:00:11] there so uh God bless you as you serve
[1:00:14] the Lord together these things go on the
[1:00:16] message Hub and people Japanese people
[1:00:18] from around the world can read them not
[1:00:20] just in Japan but wherever they are in
[1:00:22] the world if they're in America if
[1:00:24] they're in South America where Africa
[1:00:27] wherever they are they can read these
[1:00:29] sermons in their language so it's a
[1:00:32] tremendous Thing 2 Kings chapter
[1:00:34] 2:9 and it came to pass when they were
[1:00:38] gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha
[1:00:41] ask what I shall do for thee before I be
[1:00:45] taken away from thee and Elisha said I
[1:00:48] pray thee let a double portion of my
[1:00:50] spirit be upon me and and he said thou H
[1:00:56] has asked a hard thing nevertheless if
[1:00:58] thou see me when I'm taken from thee it
[1:01:01] shall be so unto thee but if not it
[1:01:04] shall not be so and it came to pass as
[1:01:09] they still went on and talked that
[1:01:12] behold there appeared a chariot of fire
[1:01:14] and Horses of fire and parted them
[1:01:17] aunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind
[1:01:20] into heaven and Elisha saw it and he
[1:01:23] cried my father my father father The
[1:01:26] Chariot of Israel and the horsemen
[1:01:28] thereof and he saw him no more and he
[1:01:31] took hold of his own clothes and rent
[1:01:33] them into two pieces and he took up also
[1:01:36] the mantle of Elijah that fell from him
[1:01:39] and went back and stood by the bank of
[1:01:42] Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah
[1:01:47] that fell from him and smoked the waters
[1:01:50] and said where is the Lord God of Elijah
[1:01:54] and when he had also smitten in the
[1:01:56] waters they parted hither and thither
[1:01:58] and Elisha went over and when the sons
[1:02:02] of the prophets which were to view at
[1:02:05] Jericho saw him they said the spirit of
[1:02:09] Elijah does rest on elishah and they
[1:02:12] came to meet him and bowed themselves to
[1:02:16] the ground before Him Father take these
[1:02:19] words today bless him to our hearts Lord
[1:02:23] we draw from inspiration from the
[1:02:26] strength as we look to your promise in
[1:02:29] Jesus name amen God bless you can be
[1:02:33] seated today I'm going to speak to you
[1:02:36] on Elijah and
[1:02:38] Elisha restoration and the double
[1:02:42] portion now all we need to do is look at
[1:02:46] Elijah and Elisha as a prophecy to know
[1:02:51] what we must do for both are a prophecy
[1:02:55] of of the end time remember when we look
[1:02:58] in the scripture we do not look at them
[1:03:01] as just a historical event or a story in
[1:03:03] the Bible but we look at it as something
[1:03:06] that is prophesying of the end time as
[1:03:10] we believe there is a bride in this last
[1:03:12] day that is going to
[1:03:14] fulfill um all righteousness and all
[1:03:17] that has been spoken of a bride and this
[1:03:20] is of course why brother Brandon
[1:03:22] preached the great message of Christ the
[1:03:24] mystery was was to show the coming of
[1:03:27] Christ and his Redemptive plans and and
[1:03:30] it was shown to the lives of men and
[1:03:32] women of the Old Testament now you know
[1:03:35] men like Abraham did not realize they
[1:03:37] were
[1:03:38] prophesying they were living a life and
[1:03:41] and maybe they didn't even understand
[1:03:44] why they did what they did but it had to
[1:03:46] be written in the
[1:03:48] scripture be you know even the story of
[1:03:51] his of his lie where he lied to ailec it
[1:03:55] had to be written in the scriptures so
[1:03:58] we would know that that that um when he
[1:04:02] when he a then took her Sarah for a wife
[1:04:06] that we could see a young king or a man
[1:04:09] taking this woman beautiful something
[1:04:12] had to happen to a 90y old woman
[1:04:16] transformation power had to have taken
[1:04:19] place and so we can see in there you
[1:04:22] know in the prophecy of body chains we
[1:04:24] can see in in the prophecy um the
[1:04:28] promised son that had been waited on a
[1:04:30] long time being given I and I tell you I
[1:04:34] I believe it's about time for this 2,000
[1:04:37] year old bride to give birth to the Son
[1:04:41] of God for the Jesus Christ The Promised
[1:04:44] son to come and so God used the Old
[1:04:48] Testament to forhad of the new and and
[1:04:51] then he uses even the New Testament to
[1:04:53] prophesy of the end time is the whole
[1:04:56] Bible is actually pointing to our day
[1:04:59] and our hour in this time of visitation
[1:05:02] now Isaiah prophesies you know that in
[1:05:05] the last days that the moon shall be as
[1:05:08] the light of the Sun and the Moon
[1:05:11] represents the bride the wife to the Son
[1:05:13] and the light of the sun will be as a
[1:05:16] combination of seven days so all the
[1:05:19] light of the church Jesus will be our
[1:05:21] light making the moon the bride the same
[1:05:25] as Christ Christ was in the beginning
[1:05:26] you will find that in Isaiah 30 and
[1:05:29] verse 26 moreover the light of the moon
[1:05:32] shall be as the light of the sun and the
[1:05:35] light of the sun shall be Sevenfold as
[1:05:37] the light of seven days in the day that
[1:05:40] the Lord bindeth up the breach of the
[1:05:42] people and health The Stroke of their
[1:05:45] wound now according to Revelation 101 he
[1:05:49] comes and his face is shining in full
[1:05:53] strength you see this is the day not of
[1:05:56] the veiling of God but of the unveiling
[1:05:59] of God where God is coming as a shining
[1:06:02] light on the scripture that has been
[1:06:05] held in obscurity that has waited for
[1:06:08] this end time now as we look into the
[1:06:11] prophecy we actually see Elijah brought
[1:06:14] a drought upon the kingdom of Jezebel
[1:06:16] and I'm calling it that because Ahab was
[1:06:19] only a figurehead she ran the show and
[1:06:22] brought terrible idolatry and false
[1:06:25] worship to Israel and at Mount carel
[1:06:29] Elijah brought a
[1:06:31] showdown he was showing that the gods of
[1:06:34] Jezebel were
[1:06:36] powerless they were powerless idols and
[1:06:39] he would do this by demonstrating the
[1:06:42] power of God this this would this in
[1:06:45] itself would be part of what helped turn
[1:06:48] the hearts of of the children of Israel
[1:06:51] back to God again this same thing had to
[1:06:54] be done in the days of Moses Moses could
[1:06:57] not walk out with a message and even say
[1:06:59] well I met an angel out there a pillar
[1:07:01] of fire and have no
[1:07:03] Vindication amen but God would send
[1:07:05] signs and and and wonders and whatever
[1:07:08] to identify a message and his messenger
[1:07:13] and so at Mount caral Elijah brought
[1:07:15] this showdown and and and in doing so
[1:07:19] before he would before the fire fell
[1:07:22] before the worship was accepted he would
[1:07:24] first a
[1:07:26] restorer He restored the
[1:07:30] altar the altar that had been torn down
[1:07:33] the stones that had been left and
[1:07:36] disarrayed that was
[1:07:38] discarded amen and so he was restored
[1:07:41] could we say a mystery truth he rebuilt
[1:07:45] the place of worship he put the stones
[1:07:48] back in the proper order the sacrifice
[1:07:51] in his proper place and then the fire of
[1:07:54] God came down and consumed it showing
[1:07:57] God had accepted it these Stones must be
[1:08:01] in order the altar rebuilt scattered
[1:08:05] truths and loose ends had to be gathered
[1:08:08] like Elijah he dug out and dusted off
[1:08:11] the stones and rebuilt the altar of
[1:08:15] God the seventh angel we know does the
[1:08:18] same Revelation 10:7 if you'll put that
[1:08:21] up for me the the seventh angel gathers
[1:08:24] them up and finish fin es the entire
[1:08:26] mystery that's what the Bible says he
[1:08:29] finishes The Mystery of the written book
[1:08:32] so Revelation 107 said but in the days
[1:08:36] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:08:39] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[1:08:42] God should be finished as he had
[1:08:44] declared to his servants the prophets
[1:08:46] actually all of the word has been
[1:08:49] declaring this end time it has been
[1:08:52] pointing to our day and to our hour
[1:08:56] amen so all the scripture whether it's
[1:08:58] the types of Esther whether it's the
[1:09:00] types of Ruth whether it's is these are
[1:09:03] not stories but prophecies in the Bible
[1:09:06] pointing to our day to our hour and we
[1:09:09] we see like even the mystery of the
[1:09:11] Kingdom of Heaven that Jesus talked
[1:09:13] about which is life under the rule of
[1:09:17] Christ and that only comes by a true
[1:09:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost and so you
[1:09:23] know it would be in parables it would be
[1:09:26] it would be written symbolically it
[1:09:29] would be told about like wise and
[1:09:31] foolish
[1:09:32] virgins now you may wonder about whether
[1:09:36] you know the kingdom of God or the
[1:09:37] Kingdom of Heaven there's really no
[1:09:39] significance different one phrase
[1:09:41] emphasizes God is The Sovereign ruler of
[1:09:43] the Kingdom the other emphasizes the
[1:09:46] kingdom itself but they're the same
[1:09:48] Kingdom and the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:09:51] life in the Holy Ghost true conversion
[1:09:55] Enders you into the rule of Christ you
[1:09:59] come under his government the kingdom of
[1:10:03] God the Bible said is not meat and drink
[1:10:06] but it is righteousness peace and joy in
[1:10:09] the Holy Ghost so the kingdom of God is
[1:10:13] righteousness in the Holy Ghost peace in
[1:10:16] the Holy Ghost joy in the Holy Ghost
[1:10:19] amen the so the kingdom of God is the
[1:10:21] Holy
[1:10:23] Ghost and unless you're born again and
[1:10:25] you cannot see or understand the kingdom
[1:10:28] of God Jesus would speak in Parables he
[1:10:33] would actually read parables are
[1:10:36] symbology in the Bible in the Book of
[1:10:39] Revelation that would be left for the
[1:10:42] last day people to understand this book
[1:10:45] of Revelation would be written years
[1:10:48] after the Apostle Paul was gone Paul
[1:10:51] never refers to the Book of Revelation
[1:10:54] it was written but it was all in symbols
[1:10:57] it was left and not understood it was
[1:11:01] Mysteries that was not revealed but it
[1:11:04] was things that were left for an end
[1:11:06] time people amen that when the time came
[1:11:10] it would be pertinent to them amen there
[1:11:13] would be an understanding come there
[1:11:15] would be a wise Who would know their God
[1:11:19] and who would do
[1:11:21] exploits amen so you see these as Jesus
[1:11:25] said in Matthew 13:11 he he answered and
[1:11:28] said it's given to you to know the
[1:11:30] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[1:11:32] to them it is not given so we know then
[1:11:35] some is given to some is not given to
[1:11:39] but God has given to us to know the
[1:11:42] mysteries of the Kingdom you can know
[1:11:46] the mysteries of the Kingdom young
[1:11:48] people is not over your
[1:11:50] head it's not something Beyond you it's
[1:11:54] given to you you to know you're are
[1:11:57] predestined people for an end time for
[1:12:00] truth to be revealed amen and this truth
[1:12:04] is a sacred truth that is revealed and
[1:12:06] it brings a liberty with it it brings a
[1:12:10] freedom from and from bondage from the
[1:12:12] chains of of the Creeds of man from the
[1:12:16] from the doctrines and the ideas of
[1:12:19] theologians and it breaks those chains
[1:12:22] and it sets you free it sets your Fe
[1:12:25] about a solid
[1:12:27] rock these restored mystery truths
[1:12:30] include God being one not two or
[1:12:34] three amen it includes water baptism by
[1:12:38] immersion taken on the name of Jesus
[1:12:40] Christ I'm just going to be very brief
[1:12:42] here it it it goes into the baptism of
[1:12:47] the Holy Ghost not as a sensation but
[1:12:50] the Life of Christ within you performing
[1:12:52] the Greater Works it it it it produces
[1:12:56] the security of the believer not this
[1:12:59] once saved always saved no matter how
[1:13:01] you live but sealed to the day of
[1:13:04] redemption Satan sealed out and you
[1:13:06] sealed in with him so you see it's not
[1:13:10] an in and out not an anointing that
[1:13:13] comes and goes but it is the spirit who
[1:13:17] abides with you forever amen and the
[1:13:20] proof of it is that it governs and it
[1:13:23] rules your life
[1:13:25] it leads you into truth it opens up your
[1:13:29] understanding it changes your life it
[1:13:33] sets you free from sin it gives you
[1:13:36] victory in your life it gives you
[1:13:39] understanding that only God can give
[1:13:42] amen and you're sealed to the day of
[1:13:45] your Redemption and there's nothing no
[1:13:48] nothing no tribulation no trial no
[1:13:52] problem no devil no nothing can never
[1:13:55] separate you from that love of God Amen
[1:13:58] for you are sealed in with him and the
[1:14:02] devil sealed
[1:14:04] [Applause]
[1:14:06] [Music]
[1:14:08] out not only that but we're
[1:14:11] predestined
[1:14:13] predestinated and chosen from before the
[1:14:16] foundation of the
[1:14:18] world as a gene of God you are his
[1:14:23] offspring you are son Sons and Daughters
[1:14:26] of the most high God and this brings us
[1:14:30] this brings us to an understanding this
[1:14:34] brings us to an understanding of
[1:14:37] Eternity it Maks us to realize that God
[1:14:40] is the only one that has
[1:14:44] immortality 1 Timothy
[1:14:46] 6:16 the Bible says of him who only have
[1:14:53] immortality amen there there is no
[1:14:56] Immortal Life in
[1:14:58] hell so hell is not Eternal that's right
[1:15:02] amen there is an eternal fire but not an
[1:15:04] eternal hell to make it Eternal would be
[1:15:07] make it equal with God it would make it
[1:15:10] in equal to Heaven hell is not an equal
[1:15:13] to
[1:15:14] Heaven There is no one lives eternally
[1:15:17] in
[1:15:18] Hell life there is temporary the soul
[1:15:21] that Sinners shall die it may burn
[1:15:24] forever and ever however long millions
[1:15:26] of years I don't know but it comes an
[1:15:28] End Amen to make it Eternal would make
[1:15:31] it equal with God people don't have
[1:15:33] eternal life in Hell God only is
[1:15:38] eternal Hallelujah and when you realize
[1:15:41] you're a Son of God you always
[1:15:44] were you didn't just begin at an altar
[1:15:48] somewhere or the day you were born here
[1:15:50] but you were there in the mind of God
[1:15:53] before the foundation of the world and
[1:15:56] there's nothing can ever remove you from
[1:15:59] God's
[1:16:00] mind you are his
[1:16:04] offspring and I got news for you not one
[1:16:06] of his children will ever be in
[1:16:12] Hell Hallelujah hell was not created for
[1:16:18] you hell was created for the devil and
[1:16:21] his
[1:16:22] angels amen here's another history that
[1:16:25] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:16:28] forever amen the same in every detail I
[1:16:32] said the same in every detail except
[1:16:35] he's not here in the Corporal flesh of
[1:16:37] Jesus but is here in the form of his
[1:16:40] body his bride the elect lady so Jesus
[1:16:45] is here this morning he's walking upon
[1:16:48] the Earth in a people his spirit is
[1:16:51] manifested in flesh his word has has
[1:16:55] taken on flesh so there is the mystery
[1:16:58] of the church who is the true bride the
[1:17:02] wise virgin who is separated from the
[1:17:04] foolish group who goes through
[1:17:06] tribulation they both have different
[1:17:09] Destinies the bride is raptured and the
[1:17:12] other goes through the tribulation for
[1:17:15] purging so it's written in the types
[1:17:18] Enoch walked with God the seventh from
[1:17:21] Adam and here we are the seventh from
[1:17:24] the the
[1:17:25] Church age from from Calvary from the F
[1:17:29] from the second Adam Jesus Christ are
[1:17:31] you with me and Enoch was the the
[1:17:34] seventh from Adam and he walked with God
[1:17:37] let me me remind you walk is a
[1:17:40] progression it's not a one and done it's
[1:17:43] Keep On Walking it's go higher it's
[1:17:46] reach for higher rounds it's adventures
[1:17:49] with
[1:17:50] God hallelujah it's going from glory to
[1:17:54] glory amen I want you to think of this
[1:17:56] now and and here and so he's tip by
[1:17:59] Rapture he was not for God took him but
[1:18:04] there was a church eight of them that
[1:18:06] went through the tribulation come out on
[1:18:08] the other side now remember again you
[1:18:11] know it's written in the Bible there was
[1:18:13] there was Abraham who was called out and
[1:18:17] elected and chosen never never part of
[1:18:23] Sodom but then there was lot who was
[1:18:25] called out of Sodom there was a CH there
[1:18:28] is the true bride the Church the true
[1:18:31] church the church is a bride and the
[1:18:33] Bride is a church brother Bram said
[1:18:35] there's been churches churches churches
[1:18:37] but there's got to come one who's a real
[1:18:39] bride who's the real church and I
[1:18:42] believe the message of this hour
[1:18:44] produces something
[1:18:47] real amen amen and so lot would go
[1:18:51] through the tribulation be saved by out
[1:18:54] as it was by fire but here Abraham never
[1:18:57] goes through that instead he receives a
[1:19:00] visitation his body is changed he
[1:19:03] receives the promised son it's all
[1:19:04] written in the
[1:19:07] types we don't have to make it up we can
[1:19:10] just look at the
[1:19:12] script and we can see we're part of the
[1:19:15] script amen here's another part the
[1:19:17] mystery of iniquity starting with the
[1:19:19] serpent seed and the fall of Man until
[1:19:21] the last age where Satan is the God of
[1:19:24] this evil evil age worshiped by millions
[1:19:27] Satan has s succeeded in sitting in the
[1:19:30] temple of God and worshiped as God he
[1:19:33] has a bride Satan does she's myy babblin
[1:19:36] the great the mother of
[1:19:40] harlots amen so he has concubines as
[1:19:43] well you see there there is other
[1:19:46] Mysteries that are laying there for
[1:19:48] example The Mystery of the Seven Stars
[1:19:52] representing seven Messengers
[1:19:55] anointed by the seven spirit of God
[1:19:57] which is one God manifested in seven
[1:20:01] different ages and and there the these
[1:20:04] ages the these ages cover the entire
[1:20:08] Gentile
[1:20:10] dispensation there's a mystery of the
[1:20:12] return of the pillar of fire now you
[1:20:14] said brother why are you going there
[1:20:16] because we've had an Elijah in this day
[1:20:19] who gathered up the up the
[1:20:21] stones discarded truths
[1:20:25] and build an
[1:20:27] altar hallelujah amen what did he do he
[1:20:32] didn't go up and write a new
[1:20:34] Bible he didn't have to go outside of
[1:20:37] the Bible didn't even have to make a new
[1:20:40] version of the Bible took this very King
[1:20:43] James version and made it
[1:20:45] Live come on church amen so you see here
[1:20:49] again the the the the these ages cover
[1:20:53] the entire Gentile dispensation and I
[1:20:56] just say there's seven of them not
[1:20:59] eight not
[1:21:02] nine not another to rise up not another
[1:21:06] age to
[1:21:09] come amen I tell you what you get
[1:21:12] outside of the seven you get outside the
[1:21:14] lamb he has seven horns seven eyes seven
[1:21:17] Messengers Seven Ages not an
[1:21:20] eighth not another
[1:21:23] messenger amen we we have come down
[1:21:25] through it and I tell you if this
[1:21:27] message don't turn your heart back if
[1:21:29] this Elijah Ministry don't return you
[1:21:31] back restoration there ain't nothing
[1:21:34] else coming it'll do
[1:21:36] it everything else is a gimmick and I
[1:21:38] just say to them get in line you'll take
[1:21:40] a number get in line I've seen many
[1:21:42] comes and many
[1:21:44] go so you see the the mystery the
[1:21:47] mystery of of the the of these truths
[1:21:50] that God has restored in this day the m
[1:21:54] of the return of the pillar of fire of
[1:21:58] whom alone is the source of all
[1:22:07] Revelation that some The Mystery of the
[1:22:11] return of the pillar of
[1:22:13] fire of whom is the alone is the source
[1:22:19] of all Revelation and true understanding
[1:22:26] it's the same one who revealed the word
[1:22:29] to Paul is the same one today who
[1:22:33] revealed God's word to the
[1:22:36] prophet we are not following the men and
[1:22:41] there theology we're not even following
[1:22:45] Brother brandham We are following the
[1:22:47] pillar of
[1:22:50] fire amen you see yeah there was a
[1:22:53] physical man like Moses that walked out
[1:22:56] and was anointed but God said I have
[1:22:59] come down I have come down to deliver I
[1:23:03] you know it's my hand I may use Moses I
[1:23:07] may he may be the voice I use he may be
[1:23:09] the the the the the messenger that I use
[1:23:13] but it isn't Moses message he got his
[1:23:16] message from a pillar of fire and we're
[1:23:19] not following anything but a pillar of
[1:23:21] fire the same Pillar of Fire that led
[1:23:24] the per all the way through it's the
[1:23:26] same Pillar of
[1:23:28] Fire Hallelujah that would deserve the
[1:23:31] heart of that woman that was in front of
[1:23:33] sister jeie and so it was the word the
[1:23:36] son of man Christ the pillar of fire
[1:23:40] manifesting
[1:23:42] [Music]
[1:23:44] himself the same Wonder revealed to his
[1:23:47] word to Paul the same one today Paul
[1:23:49] said I had to count everything I learned
[1:23:52] as
[1:23:53] dung
[1:23:55] that's I got taught by Gia he was a good
[1:23:59] teacher but I had to count it as
[1:24:01] Dum that I might win Christ you know
[1:24:05] there's people don't understand why God
[1:24:08] would choose you know a man uneducated a
[1:24:11] seventh grade
[1:24:12] Kentuckian why would he choose that why
[1:24:14] wouldn't he choose one well where do you
[1:24:16] want him from Bob
[1:24:19] Jones or you don't like Bob Jones well
[1:24:22] then you want him from this one and this
[1:24:23] denomination want he from the God said
[1:24:26] I'm not using any of
[1:24:28] them I'm going to take a man that don't
[1:24:30] know nothing so I can teach him
[1:24:33] something a seventh grader that when he
[1:24:36] starts out you know his wife has to read
[1:24:39] he read the Bible and said oh yeah yeah
[1:24:41] you you just take what it
[1:24:43] says cuz he couldn't read
[1:24:46] it amen but but you see it would it
[1:24:49] would be that wise so we didn't have
[1:24:51] something that was leaning on somebody
[1:24:54] body's
[1:24:56] understanding amen even brother bam when
[1:24:58] that comes to the opening of the seals
[1:25:00] he said you know it wasn't me he said I
[1:25:04] was about to go back and and and write
[1:25:06] some things down of what different other
[1:25:08] theologians said that's the best I
[1:25:10] figure you know maybe they're right I
[1:25:12] was about to go out with that about that
[1:25:14] time he came in the room and those
[1:25:17] Revelations that came a from that ball
[1:25:20] of fire that came in that room and
[1:25:22] revealed this to me
[1:25:26] you say oh brother Tim that's that's a
[1:25:28] that's a baloney that's just hog was
[1:25:31] that's the way he did it to
[1:25:34] Paul amen that's the way he did it to
[1:25:36] Moses that's the way he did it all
[1:25:38] through the Through the Ages am 3 and S
[1:25:42] says surely the Lord God will do nothing
[1:25:45] except he Reveals His secrets to his
[1:25:47] servants the prophets and I tell you he
[1:25:50] don't need any help he don't need
[1:25:53] somebody else to come long and bring
[1:25:55] Clarity he don't need somebody else to
[1:25:57] straighten up the Altar and rearrange it
[1:26:01] to their
[1:26:04] taste God did it the way he wanted it he
[1:26:08] sent a messenger that he was not ashamed
[1:26:10] to be identified with people get
[1:26:12] offended because of the picture of
[1:26:14] brother brandham and the pillar of fire
[1:26:16] that we have in the church right there
[1:26:17] as you as you go out I'm not offended by
[1:26:20] that God wouldn't offended to take his
[1:26:22] picture with him
[1:26:25] that's not just a picture of brother
[1:26:26] Brandon that's a picture of the Angel of
[1:26:28] the
[1:26:30] Lord and I'm not ashamed of the
[1:26:34] Gospel amen so there there is a mystery
[1:26:39] of the seven sealed voices of Thunders
[1:26:42] who when was when was heard and the
[1:26:47] understanding given revealed the
[1:26:49] mysteries of the Seven Seals this is
[1:26:53] what brother brandom said question
[1:26:54] answer 64 he said have the they asked
[1:26:58] him have they been revealed and he says
[1:27:00] yes that's what the the the Seven Seals
[1:27:03] that's what they they're the Mysteries
[1:27:06] contained in the Seven Seals that's what
[1:27:07] the Thunders was all about we don't need
[1:27:11] somebody else to come along and tell us
[1:27:13] what the Thunders mean amen the man who
[1:27:16] heard the
[1:27:18] voice told is what they
[1:27:20] mean amen it was his job the job of
[1:27:24] Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 to reveal those
[1:27:27] mystery truths to the church and I want
[1:27:30] to just say this day this scripture is
[1:27:34] fulfilled we're not waiting on it to be
[1:27:37] open to our understanding it's already
[1:27:40] been
[1:27:41] given it didn't take me or another
[1:27:44] preacher to rise up amen God did it the
[1:27:47] way he wanted it he said it the way he
[1:27:49] wanted it
[1:27:52] right the m of the spirit of Elijah who
[1:27:56] has come to bring full
[1:28:00] restoration and full
[1:28:02] Redemption these Mysteries Encompass the
[1:28:06] opening of The Seven Seals necessary to
[1:28:10] open the book to us I want to assert to
[1:28:14] you today that the book is no longer
[1:28:21] closed the mystery of God has been
[1:28:25] revealed The Silence has been
[1:28:30] broken truth that were misunderstood and
[1:28:34] misplaced placed correctly that's
[1:28:38] right it took a man with vision a
[1:28:41] prophet with vision I use this analogy
[1:28:44] often but remember you know that I I
[1:28:48] think of it sometime as 10 Blind Men Who
[1:28:51] were trying to describe an an elephant
[1:28:55] and one got a hold of the of the of the
[1:28:59] of the legs and said an elephant is a
[1:29:01] big tree
[1:29:03] trunk that's what he is that's an
[1:29:05] elephant another said nonsense he's got
[1:29:09] a hold of the Tusk said it's a shiny you
[1:29:11] know it's a very slick hard thing that
[1:29:15] ends with the
[1:29:17] point if you don't got my Revelation
[1:29:20] you're blind
[1:29:24] another blind man walks up and grabs a
[1:29:26] tail said no boys you're all wrong is a
[1:29:31] rope you see each one of them we could
[1:29:34] go on down each one of them had a part
[1:29:37] that's right but they couldn't see the
[1:29:40] whole
[1:29:41] picture until eyes came open it took a
[1:29:46] sear in this day to give us the whole
[1:29:49] picture and it's not just a tail and
[1:29:51] it's not just a lag and it's not just a
[1:29:54] tus it's the whole
[1:29:58] thing and it shows us the picture from
[1:30:01] Genesis to Revelation and the bright
[1:30:03] portion in the last
[1:30:05] day it's the same as it was in the in
[1:30:08] the Book of Daniel when handwriting was
[1:30:10] written in symbols on the wall and
[1:30:13] people saw it and people read it but
[1:30:16] they couldn't understand it and
[1:30:17] theologians and magicians came and they
[1:30:20] read it and they guessed at it and they
[1:30:22] pondered at it and probed got
[1:30:25] it but nobody could get it right until
[1:30:29] the Prophet Daniel came on the scene
[1:30:31] right amen and when Daniel walked out he
[1:30:34] said he wrote and he said it's all in
[1:30:36] symbols here's what it means the mystery
[1:30:40] is now revealed I tell you our truths
[1:30:43] are not longer no longer just symbols to
[1:30:45] us anymore it's not buried in Parable
[1:30:48] it's not hidden in
[1:30:50] symbology it has now been revealed
[1:30:57] but Isaiah
[1:30:58] said the people in the last day would be
[1:31:02] drunken and the Book of Revelation said
[1:31:05] they would be drunken with the wine of
[1:31:09] Babylon the wine of the great whor and
[1:31:13] Revelation the wine of her
[1:31:17] fornication and they would not remember
[1:31:20] alcohol wine it distorts the vision
[1:31:25] next thing you're looking and there's
[1:31:26] not one God there's three of
[1:31:33] them and you see the truth of it becomes
[1:31:37] sealed and this is what has happened
[1:31:40] down to the
[1:31:41] ages that's misunderstandings and
[1:31:46] misconceptions and the trick of the
[1:31:49] enemy coming in as a subtle Spirit as a
[1:31:52] white horse rider he comes in to ride
[1:31:55] and bring in a seed of
[1:31:57] discrepancy and he begins to distort the
[1:32:00] truth and Men begin to drink their
[1:32:07] wine men like Luther would raise up and
[1:32:10] say and this Vision clear a little bit
[1:32:14] the just shall live by faith and go back
[1:32:16] to seeing three
[1:32:21] Gods why it was it was still SE to
[1:32:24] them the Mysteries wasn't made
[1:32:28] known but that's not us Isaiah 29 in
[1:32:32] verse n said stay yourselves and wonder
[1:32:35] and cry out and cry they're drunken but
[1:32:38] not with wine they stagger but not with
[1:32:41] strong drink but look here's what it is
[1:32:43] in other words not literal wine or
[1:32:45] literal alcohol but the Lord had poured
[1:32:47] out upon you the spirit of deep sleep
[1:32:50] and has closed your eyes and the
[1:32:52] prophets and the rulers and the seers
[1:32:54] has he covered and the vision of all is
[1:32:58] become to you as words of a book that is
[1:33:00] sealed which men delivered to one that
[1:33:03] has learned a great Theologian and says
[1:33:06] you know what we really don't want to
[1:33:09] know what this
[1:33:11] means I I I can't understand it's it's
[1:33:13] sealed up it's a mystery god holds and I
[1:33:16] I don't know what it
[1:33:18] means and so then the book is delivered
[1:33:21] to him that's not learned in said read
[1:33:23] this and
[1:33:24] says I I I'm sorry I hadn't been to
[1:33:27] Bible school I'm not learned I don't
[1:33:30] know what this
[1:33:31] means wherefore the Lord said for as
[1:33:34] much as this people draw near me with
[1:33:36] their mouths and with their lips do
[1:33:38] honor me but have removed their heart
[1:33:41] far from me and their fear toward me is
[1:33:45] taught by the precept of men look this
[1:33:47] is why this derision this this cross
[1:33:51] Vision this this depthness of ears is
[1:33:53] because things have been taught by the
[1:33:56] precept of men therefore I will proceed
[1:33:59] to do a marvelous work among the people
[1:34:01] even a marvelous work and a Wonder for
[1:34:04] the wisdom of their theologians and
[1:34:06] their wise men Shall Perish and the
[1:34:09] understanding other their prudent men
[1:34:10] shall be
[1:34:13] hid but it don't end there for
[1:34:15] us because it's given to you to know the
[1:34:19] mysteries of the Kingdom
[1:34:24] and then with all of the Revelation and
[1:34:28] things that God is revealing and making
[1:34:31] known and and proven now that this is
[1:34:34] not just something probed at and guessed
[1:34:36] at but this is now a revelation from God
[1:34:41] then comes the most important sermon
[1:34:45] that came because of the seals open the
[1:34:49] supernatural Supreme token
[1:34:53] you see the proper
[1:34:55] sacrifice you see Elijah did not just
[1:34:59] build an altar and there's no
[1:35:05] sacrifice amen he actually put and
[1:35:09] placed upon the altar the lamb and its
[1:35:13] blood and Christ Jesus and His holy
[1:35:17] spirit must be the center of our worship
[1:35:22] why did you say it like that Christ
[1:35:24] Jesus and the Holy Spirit I'm not
[1:35:26] talking that they're two different
[1:35:28] beings I am talking about that one one
[1:35:31] is Christ Jesus the word and the and
[1:35:34] then the blood which is the
[1:35:37] spirit are you seeing are you understand
[1:35:40] what I'm talking about the life of the
[1:35:42] blood what came back on the day of
[1:35:44] Pentecost was the blood of God it was
[1:35:48] the Holy Spirit where the blood cell was
[1:35:50] broke out out open open at Calvary and
[1:35:53] out flow the Holy
[1:35:56] Spirit and I want you to understand that
[1:35:59] here the Elijah this day
[1:36:02] places the
[1:36:05] sacrifice the
[1:36:07] blood the life upon the
[1:36:11] truth the Holy Spirit must go with the
[1:36:16] word or it's not a proper
[1:36:19] sacrifice you see Christ Jesus the Holy
[1:36:22] Spirit must must be the center of our
[1:36:25] worship the token the true baptism of
[1:36:28] the Holy Ghost must be the focal point
[1:36:32] of our
[1:36:35] worship amen blood's got to get all over
[1:36:38] every one of those
[1:36:40] stones amen if the Life of Christ don't
[1:36:42] come on him it's just a it's just a a
[1:36:45] dead word to you it's got to cover it
[1:36:48] now listen you know true worship cannot
[1:36:51] revolve just around beautifully laid
[1:36:55] stones or mystery truth true worship
[1:36:58] must be the lamb or it must include the
[1:37:01] lamb and his blood the Holy Ghost the
[1:37:03] Holy Ghost must be in the church it's
[1:37:06] like blood of the spirit on every stone
[1:37:09] of
[1:37:10] Truth and then what guess what God comes
[1:37:14] down in the pillar of fire to vindicate
[1:37:16] it as he consumes and that therefore
[1:37:19] proves that he accepts every doctrinal
[1:37:22] stone
[1:37:24] and the offering of the
[1:37:28] Lamb that's why we preach the restored
[1:37:31] truths of the Bible we preach a Bible
[1:37:34] Jesus a Bible Holiness a Bible Doctrine
[1:37:39] and the fire Must Fall so that the works
[1:37:42] that Jesus did we do
[1:37:44] also and when we preach a Bible Jesus
[1:37:46] and a Bible Doctrine then the fire falls
[1:37:49] and when it happens people are healed
[1:37:52] filled to
[1:37:54] delivered amen that's in spirit and in
[1:37:57] truth sir amen and you know you you said
[1:38:00] well we got the truth well where's the
[1:38:02] spirit said well I got the spirit
[1:38:04] where's the truth it has to take both of
[1:38:07] them it takes two wings to fly
[1:38:09] sir you can't clip one and and expect to
[1:38:13] get off the ground you'll never make it
[1:38:19] out now in the Days of Elijah he looked
[1:38:22] out in the sky looked like
[1:38:24] brass Divine judgment was all over the
[1:38:27] country and there was no
[1:38:30] rain God said I'll Smite the Earth with
[1:38:33] a
[1:38:34] curse but I'm going to send Elijah first

[1:38:41] fathers amen then Elijah brings the

[1:45:18] what the former rain produced how much
[1:45:21] for the latter rain more the L lattering
[1:45:23] produced when God pours out his Spirit
[1:45:25] there be signs and wonders take place

[1:45:34] omnipotent has
[1:45:36] spoken amen and still
[1:45:42] speaks here

[1:48:05] the power of Elijah as Malachi 4 said to
[1:48:08] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:48:11] the faith of the fathers that anointing
[1:48:15] was the spirit of
[1:48:18] Christ that anointing would be given
[1:48:21] five times for a specific Ministry of
[1:48:24] restoration Elijah restored the altar
[1:48:28] John the Baptist would turn the hearts
[1:48:31] to the Jewish fathers to receive the
[1:48:34] children Jesus and the apostles Elijah's
[1:48:37] promised to come again according to
[1:48:40] Malachi 4 to turn the hearts of the
[1:48:42] children back to the faith of the
[1:48:43] Pentecostal fathers Amen in the in the
[1:48:47] tribulation of head the spirit of Elijah
[1:48:50] will come with the spirit of Moses
[1:48:52] representing the fullness of the law and
[1:48:55] the prophets and point the them to the
[1:49:00] the the 144,000 back to the true
[1:49:03] atonement all the while our Elijah

[1:49:37] brandham left went went forth after the
[1:49:41] Angel's visitation in the cave or the
[1:49:44] room or both hundreds of others men and
[1:49:48] women Rose proclaiming their own gift
[1:49:51] promoting their own healing
[1:49:53] campaigns every denomination had to have
[1:49:56] their own it it It produced a whole time
[1:50:00] of
[1:50:02] impersonations and then you know so we
[1:50:05] we had that and they all rose up and
[1:50:07] what they do you know they they they
[1:50:09] would steal the
[1:50:11] Limelight from what God was doing God
[1:50:14] was not just bringing healing and
[1:50:17] deliverance there was a changing of
[1:50:20] dispensations right amen there was a
[1:50:23] word to be revealed and God was
[1:50:25] vindicating a
[1:50:27] word like he did with Moses Moses walks
[1:50:30] out throws down a serpent or stick and
[1:50:32] it becomes a
[1:50:34] serpent hey you know magicians comes and
[1:50:36] does the same thing what are they doing
[1:50:38] stealing his
[1:50:40] Thunder we can do this too we got
[1:50:43] miracles too you don't have to listen to
[1:50:46] Moses message one was keeping them in
[1:50:48] Egypt one was delivering them from Egypt
[1:50:51] one was keeping them in denom ational
[1:50:53] system the other was delivering them
[1:50:56] out come on Amen see you had a host of
[1:51:00] impersonator do you know same thing
[1:51:02] happen when seven Mysteries are revealed
[1:51:04] by the coming of seven angels

[1:51:10] own personal
[1:51:12] Revelations leading and pointing people
[1:51:14] to
[1:51:16] themselves creating their own cultist
[1:51:20] denominations nevertheless
[1:51:23] there's still a passing of the
[1:51:26] Baton in spite of all of that in spite
[1:51:29] of impersonators Rising there's still
[1:51:31] the passing of the Baton from Elijah to
[1:51:36] Elisha now I want you to notice right

[1:52:39] body not one

[1:52:50] him amen
[1:52:54] the manle is the the outer garment it
[1:52:57] represents the anointing that enveloped
[1:52:59] and clothed the
[1:53:00] prophet you know his the outer garment
[1:53:04] like I just
[1:53:05] shed his
[1:53:07] coat and he just comes

[1:54:46] life hallelujah amen it's anointing the
[1:54:50] anointing that was on the word came on
[1:54:55] you it changed your perspective it
[1:54:58] changed your goals in life it changed
[1:55:00] who you thought you were and made you to
[1:55:03] know who God called you to
[1:55:05] [Applause]
[1:55:09] be Spirit of Elijah is not a human
[1:55:12] spirit it's the Holy Spirit given for
[1:55:15] the purpose of
[1:55:17] restoration and to do a specific work
[1:55:23] the mantle is symbolic of prophetic
[1:55:26] Authority when we receive a mantle from
[1:55:29] God it represents God given us
[1:55:32] empowerment represents he's given us an
[1:55:36] assignment notice I want to ask you
[1:55:39] today what is our
[1:55:42] assignment what have we been called to
[1:55:44] do to fulfill every word that's been
[1:55:47] spoke of a
[1:55:49] bride amen this is what God that we are
[1:55:51] anointing wanted to do don't we
[1:55:54] realize that we you know as Elijah
[1:55:59] Elisha types the bride that we too have
[1:56:01] been called out by
[1:56:03] name I don't know I don't know how you
[1:56:06] feel about your call but I know you know
[1:56:08] it's like I was in the in the many times
[1:56:11] in the airport and I would walk along
[1:56:14] and I would hear these announcement so
[1:56:16] and so meet your party so and so I
[1:56:18] didn't pay attention so and so go here
[1:56:21] so and so
[1:56:22] go go pick up the red phone and and and
[1:56:25] th so and so I never listened to none of
[1:56:28] it tuned it out walked right on but one
[1:56:31] day I heard my name
[1:56:33] called Tim
[1:56:35] it come to the phone you're to meet your
[1:56:38] party at a certain place we got
[1:56:40] instructions for you all of a sudden I
[1:56:43] turned
[1:56:45] around what what where's the phone
[1:56:47] where's it at my name was called you
[1:56:50] were going along you were bapti
[1:56:52] Methodist Presbyterian Catholic but this
[1:56:55] message called your name you could keep
[1:56:57] going the direction you were going God
[1:57:00] called your name and he turned you
[1:57:03] around you heard the voice this message
[1:57:07] identified you as a believer I'm not who
[1:57:11] I thought I was I'm a son or daughter of
[1:57:14] the Living God I've been chosen ordained
[1:57:18] for this hour
[1:57:20] [Applause]
[1:57:22] yes
[1:57:24] Wonder from that time on Elisha is
[1:57:27] doggedly following the prophet wherever
[1:57:30] he goes I'm not taking my eyes off of
[1:57:33] him whatever he preached that's what I
[1:57:36] preach wherever he goes That's what I
[1:57:38] preach whatever he says that's what I
[1:57:40] believe so do you understand I didn't
[1:57:43] say I understood everything I said I
[1:57:44] believe it
[1:57:47] all there's been many of things I had to
[1:57:49] lay on the Shelf until God let me know
[1:57:52] what it
[1:57:57] meant I'm not a know at
[1:58:00] all neither are you and this message
[1:58:04] don't make us know it
[1:58:05] alls it makes us Spirit
[1:58:08] L and God will even Hold Us blind the
[1:58:11] prophet said to things until the time
[1:58:13] that we have need of
[1:58:15] it amen so Elisha had to keep his eyes
[1:58:18] on Elijah to receive the double portion
[1:58:21] just as the The Church Must Keep Their
[1:58:24] Eyes On Jesus in order to receive the
[1:58:27] Holy
[1:58:29] Ghost you seeking the Holy Ghost you'll
[1:58:31] never do it looking over at the world
[1:58:33] you got to follow Jesus all the way you
[1:58:35] got to do it or you either you take an
[1:58:37] organizational life you just settle down
[1:58:39] to denominational life and warm a Pew
[1:58:42] God didn't call you to warm a Pew God
[1:58:45] called you to be Sons and
[1:58:47] Daughters led by the spirit of
[1:58:50] God oh for people led by the spirit of
[1:58:53] God I believe God leads I believe he
[1:58:57] still
[1:58:59] speaks God can use God can use what we
[1:59:04] might think or some might think is the
[1:59:05] most insignificant one maybe people that

[2:03:32] you're chosen you're place you're
[2:03:35] ordained for this
[2:03:38] hour oh
[2:03:45] Hallelujah every individual comes to
[2:03:47] this
[2:03:48] journey as Elisha did just as a church
[2:03:51] advancing from Luther Wesley to isusa
[2:03:54] Street to the fullness of the word and
[2:03:56] the spirit now you know brother Brandon
[2:03:58] would use Elijah and Elisha's narrative
[2:04:02] to typify different periods in church
[2:04:06] history he would talk about Elisha
[2:04:08] following Elijah representing the church
[2:04:10] coming out of the Dark Ages Elisha
[2:04:13] following Elijah to the school of the
[2:04:16] prophets represents the second stage of
[2:04:19] the journey which is John Wesley's age
[2:04:22] Elisha following Elijah to Jordan
[2:04:24] represents the third stage of the
[2:04:26] journey which is a Pentecostal age and
[2:04:29] finally
[2:04:30] Elisha crossing the Jordan after
[2:04:34] receiving a double portion of Elijah's
[2:04:36] spirit and it represents the stage we
[2:04:40] are
[2:04:41] in which is the time of the
[2:04:44] supernatural we have entered into the
[2:04:46] final
[2:04:49] stage using this type brother random
[2:04:52] connects the empowerment to specific
[2:04:54] historical periods like it in Luther and
[2:04:57] Methodist erors to stages and Elis
[2:04:59] Journey to the Pentecostal age is
[2:05:02] crossing the Jordan finally an entrance
[2:05:04] into the time of
[2:05:06] Supernatural
[2:05:08] manifestation you can get this by just
[2:05:10] searching Elijah and Elisha you know as
[2:05:13] you look in the message
[2:05:15] search but I want to just say to you in
[2:05:18] your own personal
[2:05:20] Journey you can not remain at any
[2:05:24] stage whether it is justification or
[2:05:27] sanctification or a baptism an anointing
[2:05:30] that comes on your spirit but you must
[2:05:33] see him as when he sends the double
[2:05:36] portion the Holy
[2:05:38] Ghost Elisha is tested as you will be
[2:05:43] stay
[2:05:44] here the word like Elijah will encourage
[2:05:47] you to stay there but I want you to say
[2:05:50] stay there
[2:05:52] only long enough to get that stage
[2:05:56] thoroughly because when Elijah or Christ
[2:06:00] moves on offering you a greater
[2:06:03] experience get up and follow
[2:06:07] him as he said as the Lord liveth and my
[2:06:11] soul liveth I'll not leave
[2:06:14] Thee I like that a determination to hold
[2:06:18] on regardless of the price you move on
[2:06:21] you keep going on with God deeper waters
[2:06:24] deeper experiences more into the love of
[2:06:26] God there's no limit it's
[2:06:30] unlimited you got to have a passion for
[2:06:32] the things of
[2:06:34] God if you're a seeker of the Holy Ghost
[2:06:37] today you got to have a passion for it
[2:06:39] it's got to mean more to you than
[2:06:41] anything I must have Jesus I must have
[2:06:45] the spirit I don't want to live another
[2:06:47] day without it I don't want to go
[2:06:49] another moment without it you've got to
[2:06:51] have a
[2:06:53] passion amen I believe I believe that
[2:06:56] that that that's the true evidence of
[2:07:00] even the spirit of God in the person is
[2:07:02] one of the true evidences which is a
[2:07:05] passion a
[2:07:11] Zeal the Bible said to the Le oans be
[2:07:15] zealous be zealous to repent every time
[2:07:19] you see something in the word
[2:07:23] line up to
[2:07:25] it come on Amen but you see you got to
[2:07:30] have a passion for the things of God you
[2:07:33] know you you want to go in the Rapture
[2:07:35] in this day and you don't even have a
[2:07:36] passion to come to church when the doors
[2:07:38] are open you got some kind of
[2:07:40] denominational view that I can take it
[2:07:43] or leave
[2:07:44] it am man you're too busy it's too far
[2:07:47] to come too much
[2:07:50] effort I said those that hunger and
[2:07:52] thirst for righteousness shall be
[2:07:55] filled amen I'm not preaching against
[2:07:57] you folks that drove three hours today I
[2:08:00] understand you can't come on Wednesday
[2:08:01] nights I get
[2:08:03] that but them making that effort should
[2:08:05] be a
[2:08:07] shame for those who just take what we
[2:08:09] have for
[2:08:12] granted amen so you see it's a
[2:08:14] prerequisite for receiving anything from
[2:08:17] God I just can't overemphasize the
[2:08:19] importance of complete Devotion to
[2:08:22] Christ having an unwavering faith in his
[2:08:25] promises just like Elisha's unwavering
[2:08:29] focus on Elijah fix your eyes solely on
[2:08:33] Jesus forget the worldly
[2:08:37] distraction I I know I know it's
[2:08:40] important to you if who wins the
[2:08:43] presidency I know I know your ball game
[2:08:46] is so
[2:08:48] important I know I know other things
[2:08:51] gets all in in line listen it's Leo
[2:08:55] deia Rich increase with goods and have
[2:08:58] need of nothing get your eyes on
[2:09:00] Jesus forget all of that let the things
[2:09:02] of this world go strangely themm so
[2:09:05] there will be many that will go and
[2:09:07] follow him to bethl now remember in this
[2:09:10] sense you know it's not it's not our
[2:09:12] Elijah our our Prophet that's there at
[2:09:15] bethl but it's the holy spirit that
[2:09:18] we're we're talking about as he leads
[2:09:20] and he you go to Beth and he says you
[2:09:22] know and you you follow Elijah there and
[2:09:26] you learn its truths you're forgiven
[2:09:29] that's the first stage of the journey
[2:09:31] you're
[2:09:32] forgiven but and don't live in past
[2:09:36] failures you're not only
[2:09:42] forgiven listen a person can be pardoned
[2:09:45] but have done the
[2:09:49] wrong you are guilty
[2:09:53] just
[2:09:55] pardoned you see you did
[2:09:59] it and you're
[2:10:01] guilty you're
[2:10:03] pardoned but you're
[2:10:06] guilty but I want you to understand true
[2:10:10] justification as revealed by this
[2:10:12] message you are not only forgiven but
[2:10:16] you are declared
[2:10:19] righteous in fact to the matter is he
[2:10:21] said you never did it in the first
[2:10:26] [Applause]
[2:10:27] place well I know I did it brother Tim I
[2:10:30] know I yeah I did it I I was there I I
[2:10:33] did that wrong I liveed that kind of
[2:10:35] life
[2:10:37] but we're not talking about that we're
[2:10:40] talking about the first place that's
[2:10:43] right where was the first place in the
[2:10:46] mind of God before the foundation of the
[2:10:49] world he do see you as a sinner he don't
[2:10:52] see your mistakes he sees you as an
[2:10:57] overcomer Hallelujah he sees you rising
[2:11:00] up as a Morning Star giving light to a
[2:11:03] darken World saying he's
[2:11:07] coming you never did it in the first
[2:11:13] place his thoughts he had toward you was
[2:11:16] not of a
[2:11:17] sinner that's my
[2:11:19] son that's my
[2:11:22] daughter and he looks over in his family
[2:11:25] album when you're looking at your
[2:11:28] mistakes he looks at your family his
[2:11:31] family album and he looks over and he
[2:11:33] finds your name and says your picture
[2:11:36] and he took a picture of you when you
[2:11:38] were in your Perfection before the
[2:11:40] foundation of the world something you
[2:11:42] ain't even been
[2:11:44] yet Hallelujah Clon you have never been
[2:11:48] yet but in his mind he saw you perfect
[2:11:52] and he can't change his mind about you
[2:11:54] he's donees everything come from Calvary
[2:11:57] to make you
[2:11:59] perfect
[2:12:05] Hallelujah if you've been justified by
[2:12:07] faith believing on the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:12:09] is a great place to be but don't stay
[2:12:12] there come on up to
[2:12:15] sanctification follow right on to the to
[2:12:18] to there to the next place to the school
[2:12:20] of the prophets
[2:12:21] you see a Sanctified life is good too
[2:12:25] good things happen there to be cleansed
[2:12:27] of old sinful habits stay there long
[2:12:30] enough to get set
[2:12:34] free amen if your nature isn't change
[2:12:37] you'll go right back like a dog to his
[2:12:39] vomit and a hog to
[2:12:40] swallow how often do we see people climb
[2:12:44] the statue of a perfect man to build a
[2:12:47] tabernacle of the living God's dwelling
[2:12:49] place and never reach the top
[2:12:53] where the individual and God are united
[2:12:55] together by the baptism of the Holy
[2:12:57] Ghost always
[2:13:00] backsliding because sanctification will
[2:13:02] not hold you without the Life of
[2:13:06] Christ well it's hard to live this
[2:13:08] message yeah without Jesus it's
[2:13:13] impossible oh yeah it's a hard
[2:13:16] life and you can you can be a pretty
[2:13:18] good homage message believer dress the
[2:13:21] part look the
[2:13:23] part but God didn't call you to be

[2:14:12] merits but can you can you imagine can
[2:14:15] you imagine how Satan would like to use
[2:14:19] the Elijah message to build
[2:14:22] denominational

[2:14:27] mother

[2:15:17] a group we go in as individuals that's
[2:15:20] right
[2:15:25] how often brother Bram to tell us like
[2:15:27] the cattle drives that he used to work
[2:15:29] in said I used to work on the old tripod
[2:15:33] i' go hunting many times in Colorado in
[2:15:35] the springtime we'd ride out with the
[2:15:37] cattle they had a drift fence coming
[2:15:38] down the app rapo Forest we heard it
[2:15:42] with the Herford Association the gra the
[2:15:45] Troublesome River there's a ranger that
[2:15:48] was there he said there was all kinds of
[2:15:51] brands that went in from different Farms
[2:15:53] that would graze on this federal land
[2:15:57] they had grazing rights there's all
[2:15:59] kinds there so he didn't check to see
[2:16:02] what brand was on
[2:16:04] them amen they wasn't looking to see if
[2:16:07] they're coming from Tim PR's
[2:16:10] church or so and so's Church looking for
[2:16:14] one thing the blood
[2:16:17] tag amen you you can you can I hope
[2:16:21] you're not branded with
[2:16:22] elt but if you're wearing that brand if
[2:16:25] that's your brand that won't make you
[2:16:27] into
[2:16:28] heaven it won't get you in the Rapture
[2:16:32] God's not coming after a bunch of little
[2:16:34] Tim bruits he's coming after Sons and
[2:16:37] Daughters of God born by the spirit
[2:16:40] washed in his
[2:16:42] blood he said brother Brandon said the
[2:16:45] ranger was looking for the blood
[2:16:49] tag that had to be genuine Herford they
[2:16:53] had to be born of a pure
[2:16:56] lineage what is that pure lineage
[2:16:58] brother it's born as a son or daughter
[2:17:02] of the Living God where God is your
[2:17:04] father and you recognize you are his
[2:17:08] son God will not look for the brown what
[2:17:11] message Brown we are we are we are
[2:17:14] wearing he won't be looking to see if
[2:17:16] you attend my church he'll be looking to
[2:17:19] see where's the blood tack
[2:17:22] he'll be looking for Thoroughbred
[2:17:25] Christians that the life get this close
[2:17:29] that the life and the nature of Christ
[2:17:32] is in
[2:17:35] you Christ a mystery brother Bram in his
[2:17:37] presence in the
[2:17:39] individual with a personal Vindication
[2:17:41] of himself expressing himself The Living
[2:17:44] Word This Promise for the day expressing
[2:17:47] itself through you a Vindication of the
[2:17:50] great revelation of God look only in an
[2:17:53] individual never in a
[2:17:56] group an individual not in a group his
[2:17:59] identification is with an individual you
[2:18:03] get that not the Methodist not the
[2:18:04] Baptist not the Presbyterian not the
[2:18:06] Luther not the Pentecostals he's naming
[2:18:08] all these different Christian
[2:18:11] sects but as an individual I'll take one
[2:18:15] and leave one I'll separate them
[2:18:18] there'll be two in a field I'll take one
[2:18:20] leave one there'll be two in a bed I'll
[2:18:22] take one and leave one it's not a group
[2:18:26] it's a personal Vindication of an
[2:18:28] impregnated child of God filled with the
[2:18:31] Holy Ghost so surrendered to God that he
[2:18:33] don't care anything about anything else
[2:18:37] is the holy spirit living its life
[2:18:39] pulsating through him showing the
[2:18:42] personal Vindication of the word itself
[2:18:45] expressing itself to the people and to
[2:18:48] the
[2:18:48] world but you see it's like I preached
[2:18:51] last Sunday you know every group claims
[2:18:53] to be the Jerusalem where all men must
[2:18:56] come to worship but we're in the time
[2:18:59] all Jerusalem's are
[2:19:01] ceasing they're over with that's not
[2:19:04] God's chosen place of worship it's in
[2:19:07] Christ and you only get in him by one
[2:19:10] Spirit
[2:19:13] baptism without the Holy Ghost you're
[2:19:15] not in there so well I don't have the
[2:19:16] Holy Ghost you're not in
[2:19:19] there I got bad news for you don't have
[2:19:21] the ticket for the
[2:19:22] Rapture you're going to be left
[2:19:25] behind amen you see every you know God's
[2:19:30] chosen place of worship is in
[2:19:34] Christ and the only way in Christ is by
[2:19:38] one
[2:19:40] Spirit we are
[2:19:42] baptized not water baptism but by Spirit
[2:19:46] baptism we're baptized into one body so
[2:19:50] the only way in the church is not by
[2:19:52] joining it not even being born in a
[2:19:55] message
[2:19:56] group my daddy believed this my
[2:19:58] granddaddy I don't care what they was
[2:20:00] you got to be born again and I mean you
[2:20:02] got to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:20:05] that's what I mean but you see you see
[2:20:08] men want to sit in the place of worship
[2:20:13] and want
[2:20:14] preeminence and this is what has broke
[2:20:16] the message up into a thousand
[2:20:19] fragments is party spirits of I'm a Paul
[2:20:22] and I'm I'm a sephus and this brings us
[2:20:26] to
[2:20:29] Jericho the a Revival brought the church
[2:20:32] right up to the edge and and they spoke
[2:20:35] with tongues and
[2:20:37] prophesied so anointed on the spirit
[2:20:40] realm but often we're living backslidden
[2:20:44] lives can you imagine
[2:20:46] alcoholics often drunk in the Pulpit
[2:20:49] praying for the sick and seeing
[2:20:53] results happened with AA
[2:20:56] Allen I'm just saying to you don't get
[2:20:58] them just enough to jump and Shout
[2:21:00] that's right it's all right to jump and
[2:21:02] Shout I'm not preaching against that
[2:21:05] amen you know but don't just get enough
[2:21:07] to jump and Shout up and down the aisle
[2:21:09] go on across Jordan to death to
[2:21:16] South amen now on the other side of
[2:21:19] Jordan every promis
[2:21:22] LS and this is where you must go into
[2:21:25] the choken life the literal life of
[2:21:29] Jesus
[2:21:30] Christ brother why would you preach this
[2:21:32] because some people are at Jericho some
[2:21:34] people are at bethl some people
[2:21:38] are School of the
[2:21:42] prophets and and I want to say God moved
[2:21:46] there and that was a work of God and
[2:21:48] even in your life that was a work of God
[2:21:51] but it's not a place to stay follow the
[2:21:55] spirit it's going to lead you across
[2:21:58] Jordan it's going to take you amen where
[2:22:02] the double portion
[2:22:04] comes the Holy Ghost is somebody with me
[2:22:07] amen and brother bradam said oh brother
[2:22:10] Cross Jordan get on the other side the
[2:22:12] portion double portion of the holy
[2:22:14] spirit that was upon Christ Jesus was
[2:22:16] sent back to the church to minister and
[2:22:19] to carry on the work of until he come a
[2:22:21] little while the world seeth me no more
[2:22:23] yet you will see me I a personal pronoun
[2:22:26] will be with you even in you to the end
[2:22:28] of the world he's raised from the dead
[2:22:30] with this church tonight in spiritual
[2:22:31] form giving you every bit of the powers
[2:22:34] he had upon him here on the earth is
[2:22:37] handed over to the church to use and
[2:22:39] you're afraid to use it I wonder if you
[2:22:41] have taken the last
[2:22:44] step he didn't say it's not here he says
[2:22:47] you're afraid
[2:22:50] to use
[2:22:55] it that's the problem I just want to ask
[2:22:58] you why did why would brother Randon
[2:23:00] preach the token if it's
[2:23:04] unattainable it's the promised land be
[2:23:06] filled with the
[2:23:08] spirit amen it's the ticket to the
[2:23:10] Rapture without it you're not going well
[2:23:12] if we receive the
[2:23:15] spirit you know many will say well we we
[2:23:18] received the spirit when we were
[2:23:20] justified by faith and we believed on
[2:23:22] the Lord Jesus Christ and
[2:23:25] no that was a work of the spirit
[2:23:29] justifying
[2:23:30] you that's where many are disappointed
[2:23:33] in this day well I believe the message
[2:23:35] well
[2:23:37] great that's only being able to read it
[2:23:39] makes
[2:23:43] sense you know brother brandham said
[2:23:46] that's good but you must have the token
[2:23:48] well I believe you brother brandham
[2:23:50] every a bit of it he said that's good
[2:23:53] but you must have the token why would he
[2:23:56] say you've got to have it and it's not
[2:24:00] available amen why preach something that
[2:24:02] is out of our
[2:24:03] reach why preach the most important
[2:24:06] message from since to open on the Seven
[2:24:09] Seals and you can't get it it's
[2:24:12] something in the
[2:24:14] future you see let me just say to
[2:24:18] you it's only in the future if you're
[2:24:20] back over in justification or you're
[2:24:22] over in sanctification well then it's in
[2:24:24] your
[2:24:25] future but for the church is not in our
[2:24:28] future is
[2:24:29] present it's how you get into the body
[2:24:33] could I just bear with could you bear
[2:24:34] with me just for a moment I I want to go
[2:24:36] with this for for some of you that that
[2:24:38] are stuck
[2:24:40] here because you know I'm preaching to
[2:24:42] all levels of people so you know you
[2:24:46] don't receive the Holy Ghost When You
[2:24:49] Believe
[2:24:53] believing is a confession made unto
[2:24:58] salvation in Acts 19 Paul met a bunch of
[2:25:02] Baptists and was and asked have you
[2:25:04] received the Holy Ghost sent you belief
[2:25:06] well we didn't know there was such a
[2:25:08] thing as the Holy
[2:25:09] Ghost well how was you
[2:25:12] baptized so then they re-baptized them
[2:25:14] in the name of Jesus Christ and laid
[2:25:17] hands on them and the Holy Ghost Came
[2:25:18] Upon them and they spake in tongues and
[2:25:22] prophesied in Acts chapter 8 in Samaria
[2:25:26] there was a man by the name of Simon he
[2:25:28] was a sorcerer who made himself to be
[2:25:31] some great one claiming to have great
[2:25:33] Powers the great power of God but
[2:25:35] Bewitched them with
[2:25:37] sorceries and Philip comes along and he
[2:25:40] comes to Samaria and he preached Christ
[2:25:43] unto them and guess what in verse 6 of
[2:25:46] chapter 8 of Acts the people with one
[2:25:49] Accord gave he
[2:25:50] unto the things which which which Philip
[2:25:53] spake hearing and seeing the Miracles
[2:25:56] which he did for unclean spirits crying
[2:25:58] out with a loud voice came out of many
[2:26:00] that were possessed with them and were
[2:26:03] and many were taken with py and that
[2:26:05] were lame were healed verse 12 and the
[2:26:09] Bible said they believed
[2:26:11] Phillip preaching the things of the
[2:26:14] concerning the kingdom of God and the
[2:26:16] name of Jesus Christ now that's a good
[2:26:18] start yeah they believed Phillip I
[2:26:22] didn't say they believe the Bible said
[2:26:25] they
[2:26:26] believed but notice he said they
[2:26:29] believed preaching Philip preaching
[2:26:32] concerning the things of the kingdom of
[2:26:33] God the name of Jesus Christ and guess
[2:26:36] what they were water
[2:26:38] baptized and there's where many people
[2:26:40] stopped short in the
[2:26:43] message they accept the truths of it get
[2:26:47] baptized in water what more can I do
[2:26:50] will receive the Holy
[2:26:52] Ghost amen they were baptized both men
[2:26:55] and women then guess what the sorcer
[2:26:58] Simon himself believed I didn't say he
[2:27:02] believed the Bible said he believed
[2:27:04] that's right and he was
[2:27:07] baptized notice this and the Bible says
[2:27:10] in verse 14 that samarra received the
[2:27:14] word of God so they receive the message
[2:27:17] they believe the message they accept
[2:27:20] Christ and they were
[2:27:22] baptized is everybody with
[2:27:25] me and
[2:27:27] then the apostles heard that they had
[2:27:31] received the word they sent unto them
[2:27:33] Peter and John who come down and prayed
[2:27:35] for them that they might receive the
[2:27:36] Holy Ghost well I thought they would
[2:27:38] have got the Holy Ghost when they
[2:27:39] believed when they had heard the word
[2:27:41] when they had accepted the message but
[2:27:43] that's not what the Bible said amen they
[2:27:46] had not received the Holy Ghost as he
[2:27:49] had fallen on none of them only they
[2:27:52] were baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:27:56] Jesus so the Holy Ghost is an experience
[2:27:59] that comes after believing and then they
[2:28:02] laid hands verse 17 on them and they
[2:28:05] reive the Holy Ghost Verse 18 and then
[2:28:07] Simon saw through the laying on hands of
[2:28:09] the Apostle the Holy Ghost was given and
[2:28:11] he wanted to buy
[2:28:13] it I want this gift too and of course
[2:28:17] Peter said your money perish with you
[2:28:18] verse 21 thou Hast neither part or lot
[2:28:21] in this matter for thy heart is not
[2:28:24] right in the sight of God wait a minute
[2:28:26] he believed and was baptized and his
[2:28:28] heart was not right in the sight of
[2:28:34] God yet he had believed and had B was
[2:28:37] baptized verse 22 repent therefore of
[2:28:40] this wickedness this is how to get the
[2:28:43] Holy Ghost
[2:28:44] repent turn from your way you you can
[2:28:47] believe it you can intellectually
[2:28:49] receive it but you God to believe it
[2:28:51] from the heart and repent and pray to
[2:28:54] God if he that the thought of thine
[2:28:56] heart may be forgiven the for I perceive
[2:28:59] that in Thou Art in the gall of
[2:29:01] bitterness and the bond of iniquity yet
[2:29:04] he was a baptized
[2:29:09] believer Ephesians 1:13 says in whom you
[2:29:12] trusted after you heard the word of
[2:29:14] Truth The Gospel of your salvation in
[2:29:17] whom after that you believe somebody say
[2:29:20] after after you believe you were sealed
[2:29:24] with that Holy Spirit of
[2:29:28] promise you see we're in the
[2:29:32] script and this is the promise that is
[2:29:34] given this is how to get into the body
[2:29:38] this is what is required in this last
[2:29:40] day so you see right there even in Luke
[2:29:44] 1730 before the burning and I'm trying
[2:29:46] to hurry this cramming a lot right now
[2:29:48] you know trying to get this thought down
[2:29:50] you know right now we're here in the
[2:29:52] sodomite age and it's a time where the
[2:29:55] son of man the ministry of Christ
[2:29:59] returns and we saw
[2:30:03] it what we saw was the ministry of Jesus
[2:30:09] Christ but it returns to anoint a bride
[2:30:14] people listen God's object of sending
[2:30:17] the message was not just to have a
[2:30:19] prophet that's right or to give us a new
[2:30:21] set of doctrines the mind the central
[2:30:25] thought of God has always been I want a
[2:30:29] bride I want a people they'll be for my
[2:30:32] name's sake they'll be in my image
[2:30:35] they'll be in my likeness I want a
[2:30:42] bride and the ministry of Christ has
[2:30:45] come to anoint a
[2:30:48] bride now Sur we can see the son of man
[2:30:51] Ministry was more than
[2:30:54] discernment as a boy I stood there
[2:30:56] watched him talk about and turn his back
[2:30:58] and call them out call call people out
[2:31:01] that I knew and that I knew he didn't
[2:31:04] know hear their testimony people I went
[2:31:07] to church with I am a
[2:31:09] witness I saw it I heard it but you see
[2:31:15] surely we can see the son of man
[2:31:17] Ministry was more than miracles and
[2:31:20] working of Miracles it was more than
[2:31:23] discernment and working of Miracles it
[2:31:25] was the nature and the life of Christ
[2:31:28] has returned to the bride's body amen
[2:31:33] producing a people that is one with the
[2:31:38] word hallelujah so you see as Elijah
[2:31:42] Elisha followed Elijah I want a double
[2:31:47] portion amen sometimes friend we're
[2:31:50] afraid there to ask for big things but
[2:31:53] Elisha wasn't ask afraid to ask God for
[2:31:56] big things amen I want a double portion
[2:32:00] Jesus Promised a double portion he said
[2:32:03] the works that I do shall you do also
[2:32:06] and greater than the say you do for I go
[2:32:09] to the father brother Brandon said in
[2:32:12] the message trial I challenge you to
[2:32:14] believe that the son of man is being
[2:32:17] revealed in the bride's body where is he
[2:32:19] being being revealed in Bride body amen
[2:32:23] the word taken on
[2:32:25] flesh Oh my he said he would go he said
[2:32:29] if churches come through justification
[2:32:30] Luther sanctification Wesley through
[2:32:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost Pentecost go
[2:32:35] right into the Perfection of the son of
[2:32:37] man when husband and wife will be the
[2:32:40] selfsame
[2:32:42] person
[2:32:44] amen God will be so manifested in his
[2:32:47] bride his church till they will be the
[2:32:51] same one they are one amen I want to
[2:32:56] tell you you are the continuation of the
[2:32:59] book of
[2:33:02] Acts and I'm talking about the Holy
[2:33:04] Spirit who wrote the book you are the
[2:33:08] continuation you are the continuation of
[2:33:11] the ministry of
[2:33:12] Christ that's what you're seeing right
[2:33:15] here Among Us it's the ministry of
[2:33:17] Christ amen it's God expressing himself
[2:33:20] in the fullness of the godhead deity to
[2:33:23] his church having preeminence in the
[2:33:25] church the anointed man now the anointed
[2:33:29] people Amen to bring back the anointed
[2:33:32] bride in the my anointed bridegroom

[2:33:42] all that he is God's Earthly strength
[2:33:46] amen his rule is upon his shoulders the
[2:33:49] government his rule in his body amen
[2:33:52] this is a bride coming of Christ Elijah
[2:33:56] is was gone but the spirit of Elijah is
[2:33:58] still
[2:34:00] here anointing Elijah I'm not talking
[2:34:02] about human Spirit but the spirit of
