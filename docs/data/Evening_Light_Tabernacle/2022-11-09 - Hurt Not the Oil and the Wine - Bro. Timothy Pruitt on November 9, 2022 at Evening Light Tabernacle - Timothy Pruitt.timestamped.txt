[42:21] amen
[42:22] amen let's turn to Revelations chapter
[42:25] 6.
[42:35] hey man it's good to be in the house of
[42:37] the Lord
[42:38] amen still
[42:41] kind of getting over some jet lag
[42:44] this uh this week and your mind's a
[42:47] little bit scrambled and hard to focus
[42:49] but we're glad to be here tonight amen
[42:52] it's always good to be home
[42:54] amen we will be again gone this weekend
[42:57] for that wedding for brother Joshua
[43:00] Pruitt and his wife to be and and for
[43:03] the Pruitt family so be there in
[43:06] Oklahoma with them this weekend so
[43:08] amen looking forward to what the Lord
[43:10] has in store for them
[43:12] amen Revelations chapter 6 and verse 5
[43:15] and when he had opened the third seal I
[43:19] heard the third Beast say come and see
[43:21] and I'll be held in low a black horse
[43:24] and he that sat on him had to pair had a
[43:27] pair of balances in his hand
[43:29] and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the
[43:32] four beasts say a measure
[43:35] of wheat for a penny and three measures
[43:39] of barley for a penny and see thou hurt
[43:42] not the oil and the wine amen we let you
[43:47] be seated this evening
[43:52] I like to speak to you on hurt not the
[43:55] oil
[43:56] and the wine just looking as we I've
[44:00] personally been going through the Seven
[44:02] Seals and listening to them
[44:04] and uh just seeing what God has revealed
[44:08] in our age amen as we we're all living
[44:11] all know some of these things but just
[44:13] to go over them rehearse them in our
[44:14] minds as we know that the ages have been
[44:18] Satan has tried to destroy the light in
[44:21] every age he's tried to put it out in
[44:24] every Age and and we know that the the
[44:26] four horses symbolize in him as he rides
[44:30] and the White Horse is the Antichrist
[44:33] Spirit and the red horse and the Black
[44:35] Horse and and into the Pale Horse
[44:38] but also that it's very comforting to
[44:41] know that is not just him there but
[44:43] there's also for anointings that are
[44:46] there to combat him as he would take his
[44:48] ride and we know that those anointings
[44:50] be the lion and the ox and the man and
[44:53] the ego and and I'm thankful to know
[44:55] that today that we're not fighting him
[44:57] alone but and we're not fighting the
[45:00] darkness alone but there's a light that
[45:02] is with us and is combating the darkness
[45:05] that is around us as we know that it's
[45:07] the same demon that same devil same
[45:10] Satan that would ride all the way down
[45:13] through every age it's also the same God
[45:16] watching over his people in every age
[45:18] because he's determined to have a life
[45:21] in every age he's determined to have a
[45:23] people in every age he's determined hey
[45:26] I'm thankful for that because I'm I'm
[45:28] thankful to know that he's determined to
[45:31] have as he was in the first second third
[45:33] fourth all the way down he's just as
[45:35] determined tonight to have a people in
[45:38] this age and overcome her and so to have
[45:40] that he would have to give a strength or
[45:42] the ability or an anointing to make sure
[45:45] his word would come to pass now we know
[45:48] that this black horse is representing
[45:50] the Dark Ages and we know in that time
[45:52] it was a very dark time as as Darkness
[45:55] would try to put out the last bit of
[45:58] light it would try to put out that last
[46:00] bit of life that is coming through the
[46:03] seed or through the plant it was trying
[46:05] to kill that life and it was trying to
[46:07] stop that life from going through but we
[46:10] also see here that he spoke up and he
[46:12] said don't touch so don't hurt the oil
[46:15] and the wine or the life that is going
[46:17] through the body there must be a life to
[46:19] continue because of that life was
[46:21] stopped in in that age and us in our
[46:24] time we would not have no hope amen we
[46:26] would be it'd be nothing but a dead
[46:28] plant but God was determined that this
[46:31] life was going to continue in every age
[46:33] and it didn't matter what little bit it
[46:35] got down to how many what little group
[46:37] it got through it was going to go
[46:39] through every every spot now we see as
[46:42] this oil and wine amen it symbolizes
[46:46] something the oil symbolizes the spirit
[46:48] of God or the Holy Spirit and you can
[46:51] see all all through the Bible you can
[46:53] see it in Leviticus 8 and verse 12 where
[46:56] Aaron was anointed with oil you can see
[46:58] it in Zechariah 4 and 12 the oil that
[47:01] came down through the pipes and so forth
[47:03] you can see and he said this is my
[47:06] spirit you can see it in Matthew 14 and
[47:08] verse 25 have in the foolish virgins
[47:11] that had no oil no Spirit and the wise
[47:14] versions that had oil and had spirit and
[47:16] you can see it all through the Bible now
[47:18] also many times through the Bible oil
[47:21] and wine is together you can see it I I
[47:24] was just looking at it in the in the in
[47:25] the man who came to the uh the great the
[47:28] Good Samaritan as he would find that man
[47:30] that was wounded on the road he would he
[47:32] would address him with oil and with wine
[47:36] amen so it also it comes together you
[47:39] cannot you cannot divide it all simply
[47:42] simplifies the spirit it symbolizes
[47:45] Spirit but wine symbolizes the
[47:48] stimulation of Revelation amen so where
[47:51] their spirit is there's also the
[47:53] stimulation of Revelation amen he said
[47:56] Hey brother Brian will say when I
[47:57] realize what that stood for he said I
[48:00] like to run all over the place he said
[48:02] it's a wonder I didn't wake up the
[48:04] neighborhood when God showed me that the
[48:07] stimulation of Revelation all and wine
[48:10] in the Bible is always
[48:13] Associated together he said I've seen it
[48:16] all the way down to the concordances
[48:18] down to the scriptures he said when the
[48:20] truth or the promised word of God has
[48:22] been truly revealed his Saints that's
[48:25] filled with all they will all get
[48:28] stimulated
[48:30] amen if they're filled with all they
[48:32] will all get stimulated so if you see
[48:35] someone that's not stimulated you find
[48:37] maybe there's a problem they don't have
[48:39] the oil amen because it's always running
[48:41] he said it hears from the seals wine is
[48:44] a stimulation he said Glory I feel it
[48:47] right now stimulate it with joy shouts
[48:50] and when it does it has the same effect
[48:53] upon them that wine that that wine has
[48:56] upon the natural man amen has the same
[48:59] effect as wine has upon the natural man
[49:01] because when Revelation has been given
[49:04] of the truth of God the True Believer
[49:07] that's filled with all the Revelation is
[49:10] revealed and the stimulation becomes so
[49:12] great that it makes him behave himself
[49:15] unnormally
[49:18] Hallelujah that means you cannot have
[49:21] the oil and be a normal person
[49:24] you're not going to be normal when it
[49:26] comes to being compared to this world
[49:27] thank God I'm thankful that when it
[49:30] comes becomes comes to being compared to
[49:33] this world I'm not thought of being a
[49:35] normal person amen because what's
[49:37] thought of being normal is not who I am
[49:40] or who I want to be but what I am is a
[49:43] child of God a Son of God and therefore
[49:46] as a Son of God filled with the oil of
[49:48] God and stimulated by the revelation of
[49:51] who he is and who I am it makes me act
[49:55] unnormally it makes something happen on
[49:58] the inside amen it makes them behave
[50:01] themselves un seemingly
[50:05] well I believe in church order well you
[50:08] ought to go listen to the seals again
[50:09] Amen brother random talks about it very
[50:12] clearly he says when someone has the all
[50:15] of God in them and the Revelation falls
[50:18] upon their heart they can't help but be
[50:20] stimulated it's something that reacts or
[50:24] something that moves as this unseen
[50:26] Force he would call it in places you
[50:28] know it's a man one time that would talk
[50:30] about a doctor actually that says what
[50:32] talks about somebody uh you know just
[50:34] reacting he said he said you can't react
[50:37] unless there's something Amen to cause a
[50:40] reaction and he said what is happening
[50:42] to people when they begin to scream amen
[50:44] and they begin to shout he said it's the
[50:47] Unseen force of the angels of God that
[50:50] are moving upon them that's causing them
[50:52] to act that way amen therefore it causes
[50:55] us to act unnormally or to be classified
[50:58] as Holy Rollers
[51:01] I'd rather be a Holy Roller than an
[51:03] Unholy roller amen because I see them
[51:06] all over the world that ain't you say
[51:07] well there's something about these you
[51:09] know a Holy Roller that's a bad name no
[51:11] what's a bad name is an Unholy ruler
[51:14] because you see them at different places
[51:16] when they get stimulated by what
[51:18] stimulates them and the world and their
[51:20] and the things that they bring enjoyment
[51:22] and what brings enjoyment to them and
[51:24] they get all tore up about it and they
[51:26] roll around about it and they shout
[51:28] about it well if they can shout about
[51:30] those kind of things in the world how
[51:32] why can't we shout about the goodness of
[51:34] God and the and the Miracles of God and
[51:37] the healings of God and the Deliverance
[51:39] of God and the word of God and it shows
[51:42] me who I am and I'm not lost I'm saved
[51:45] amen I'm not bound I'm free amen it
[51:48] shows me who I am it causes a
[51:51] stimulation on the inside it causes
[51:54] something to happen amen when that when
[51:56] that begins to take place and he said
[51:58] you can turn right over to Acts 2 and he
[52:00] goes right there and he said they had
[52:02] the promise that had been given them
[52:04] with all the promise of the Holy Spirit
[52:06] was to be poured out scripturally
[52:08] Vindicated he said what did they say now
[52:10] wait he told us to wait here for our
[52:13] ministry he said maybe after a few days
[52:15] a few of them got a little sideways and
[52:18] decided you know why I think we already
[52:19] got it we already got it he said why are
[52:22] we waiting for we've already got it and
[52:24] others said well let's just wait another
[52:25] day nine days come well I think we
[52:28] already got it he said but Simon stood
[52:31] up who had the keys and he said now wait
[52:33] a minute the scriptures got something to
[52:35] say with this he never told us just how
[52:37] many days away he said you stayed there
[52:40] until until what Joel's prophecy comes
[52:44] to pass until Isaiah's prophecy is
[52:47] Vindicated for with stammering lips and
[52:50] with other tongues when I speak to this
[52:52] people and this is the refreshment this
[52:56] is the wine that's poured out
[53:00] hallelujah what is wine in the Bible
[53:02] it's a refreshment
[53:05] it's the refreshment that comes from the
[53:08] presence of the Lord it's got to be
[53:10] scriptural now you see wine represents
[53:13] stimulation of Revelation and when the
[53:16] Holy Ghost fell they seen fire of God
[53:18] fall upon them by that began to
[53:21] stimulate them
[53:24] and the first thing you know they got so
[53:26] stimulated to people actually thought
[53:29] they were drunk
[53:31] but they weren't drunk with no some wine
[53:34] of the world they were drunk by the
[53:36] being stimulated by the Revelation that
[53:39] the Holy Ghost is not just there anymore
[53:42] or in a body called Jesus it's now in
[53:45] human flesh in 120 in the upper room
[53:50] and they realized then that the same
[53:52] life that was in Jesus is now living on
[53:55] the inside of them
[53:57] that if he overcame they can overcome
[54:02] Hallelujah
[54:03] amen and this is what's began to cause a
[54:06] stimulation on the inside of them that
[54:09] caused an excitement
[54:12] well I don't know about that excitement
[54:14] what it causes that
[54:16] it might cause it in different ways and
[54:19] other people and you know and and
[54:22] just as natural wine has different
[54:25] effects
[54:27] amen so does this it has different
[54:29] effects
[54:30] amen but the main thing is to realize I
[54:33] need to be filled with the oil of God
[54:37] amen so when the Revelation comes the
[54:40] stimulation is there with it
[54:43] amen God Vindicated Revelation made
[54:47] plain to them and they was happy about
[54:50] it
[54:51] well then what's wrong with us being
[54:53] happy about it
[54:55] God's revelated plan for this day has
[54:58] been made plain to us how come we can't
[55:02] be happy about it
[55:04] well we realize amen we're not just
[55:06] continuing on and to perpetuate another
[55:09] generation or another church age but
[55:11] this is the last stage this is the
[55:13] rapture age this is the bride age this
[55:16] is the coming of the Lord how come we
[55:18] can't be happy about it
[55:22] it causes stimulation it causes
[55:24] something to happen on the inside he
[55:27] said that's the reason Peter can get out
[55:29] there and say why you men of Judea you
[55:31] dwell in Jerusalem listen to me are you
[55:33] not doctors of divinity listen to what
[55:35] I'm going to tell you how wonderful
[55:37] revealed revealed they become so
[55:40] stimulated when they seen it Vindicated
[55:43] they saw it Vindicated therefore it
[55:47] caused a stimulation
[55:50] they saw a revelation revealed therefore
[55:53] it caused something on the inside of
[55:56] them to react by because they had
[55:58] something on the inside
[56:02] amen you know
[56:05] people people say well you know you tell
[56:08] those testimonies about sister Lana or
[56:10] you tell them about Sister Mariah you're
[56:12] telling them about sister Karen you're
[56:14] telling about Brother David or this one
[56:16] or that one or another you know
[56:19] why do we do that because it's the word
[56:22] that's been Vindicated or revealed
[56:25] it shows Jesus Christ Among Us
[56:31] amen therefore amen it causes a reaction
[56:34] it causes it to also stimulate faith
[56:39] I've seen it happen you go to telling
[56:41] testimonies and the goodness of God and
[56:43] the things of God Amen Faith starts
[56:46] building
[56:47] it starts stimulating on something on
[56:49] the inside of somebody else to say hey
[56:52] if God healed her he can heal me if God
[56:55] delivered that one he can deliver me
[56:59] Amen brother Tim told about brother
[57:00] Justin's salvation just throughout a few
[57:03] days ago and I can't tell you how many
[57:05] come up and said I want my son delivered
[57:07] I want my husband back I want my family
[57:10] back together I've God can do it for
[57:13] them he can do it for me
[57:15] it causes a stimulation of faith
[57:21] but darkness is trying to put it out and
[57:24] darkness is trying to say it can't
[57:25] happen and darkness is pushing against
[57:27] it but God said don't touch the oil in
[57:30] the wine
[57:32] don't don't touch that
[57:34] amen
[57:36] when I say God promise to do a certain
[57:38] thing in these days
[57:40] and he's promised to break these seals
[57:42] in the last day and you don't know the
[57:45] joy and the glory when I see he's
[57:48] revealed this and stand there and watch
[57:51] it happen
[57:52] and he said he never did say one thing
[57:54] to us about what what wouldn't happen
[57:56] and then to see the joy that's in my
[57:58] heart when I see his promise for this
[58:01] last day as he promised he would do it
[58:04] and here he is doing it
[58:07] he's vindicating it and he's making it
[58:09] perfectly right he said well I feel
[58:12] religious
[58:16] and people think we ought to sit around
[58:17] like a bunch of bumps on the log and
[58:20] come on now
[58:22] I saw my name in the book
[58:25] the book came open and I got a peek on
[58:28] the inside of there
[58:31] don't you think that amen don't you
[58:33] think that uh Haman he was after he was
[58:36] after Esther and Mordecai amen but the
[58:39] Bible said the book was open the book of
[58:40] remembrance was open one night and he
[58:43] began to read in there the king began to
[58:44] read in there and find out that Mordecai
[58:46] had saved his life and nothing had been
[58:49] done for Mordecai he said what what
[58:51] happened the book when the book came
[58:53] open Mordecai and Haman traded places
[58:59] Hallelujah when the book came open don't
[59:02] you think Mordecai got a little
[59:03] stimulated when he realized I had the
[59:06] Gallows that had been built for him no
[59:08] longer was for him but there was for the
[59:10] one who built them
[59:13] Amen in there Mordecai one but one woman
[59:16] was going to be hanging there and the
[59:18] next moment Haman is hanging there I
[59:21] believe that stimulated him a little bit
[59:24] and you mean to tell me I'm not supposed
[59:27] to get happy and Shout about things when
[59:29] I realize hell ain't for me no more
[59:32] I never was going to hell hell's not my
[59:35] home
[59:36] but it's for the devil and his angels
[59:39] the very one that's trying to kill me
[59:42] the very one that's trying to destroy me
[59:45] it's going to be destroyed
[59:46] [Applause]
[59:50] I'm not supposed to get excited about
[59:52] that
[59:55] I'm just supposed to well that's a
[59:56] pretty good story no it's a revelation
[1:00:02] stimulated by revelation
[1:00:05] the the ones in the upper room became so
[1:00:08] stimulated over the Revelation that
[1:00:11] they've been that the promise was
[1:00:13] Vindicated they broke out the joy of
[1:00:16] stimulation to the people said they're
[1:00:18] drunk with new wine
[1:00:20] when God revealed his promise to them
[1:00:22] and not only did he reveal it he proved
[1:00:25] it
[1:00:27] that's what I've always said a man can
[1:00:29] say anything but when God comes around
[1:00:31] and vindicates it and proves it the
[1:00:34] Bible said if there be anyone among you
[1:00:35] claims to be spiritual or Prophet if he
[1:00:37] says he sings it don't come to pass then
[1:00:40] don't pay attention to him don't fear
[1:00:41] him at all don't fear that man for what
[1:00:44] he says don't come to pass that's not me
[1:00:45] that's him
[1:00:48] but if he is sin but if he does speak it
[1:00:51] and it comes to pass then it's me
[1:00:57] you know there's a little Samaritan
[1:00:59] woman
[1:01:00] scripture said that Messiah would do
[1:01:02] things and he would he would vindicate a
[1:01:04] certain way and he would do this and she
[1:01:05] was she'd come down to a well
[1:01:09] and she
[1:01:11] she begins to talk to him and he begins
[1:01:13] to reveal things to her
[1:01:17] maybe the first time he said something
[1:01:19] she might have thought well he guessed
[1:01:20] pretty good on that
[1:01:21] but when he hit it Time After Time After
[1:01:24] Time After Time then what this was no
[1:01:26] guessing
[1:01:28] this wasn't no accident
[1:01:31] this was on purpose
[1:01:33] and began to tell her the the secrets of
[1:01:36] her heart this was an accident this was
[1:01:38] on purpose
[1:01:40] amen and listen all of these things that
[1:01:42] have taken place it's not an accident
[1:01:44] it's on purpose
[1:01:46] God is calling to the hearts of men and
[1:01:49] women on purpose
[1:01:51] amen revealing things and doing things
[1:01:54] it's not by accident
[1:01:56] and he's speaking to her and here she
[1:01:59] thought you know things were so
[1:02:00] important her water pot was so important
[1:02:02] this was so important you know her way
[1:02:05] she worship was so important and he
[1:02:07] began to check it off one by one by one
[1:02:09] by one and she said you know when when
[1:02:11] the Messiah comes he'll he'll do that he
[1:02:14] said I am he
[1:02:16] and that Revelation struck her heart
[1:02:20] and brother Brandon said when that
[1:02:21] became revealed to her that she wasn't
[1:02:24] standing before just a Jew or standing
[1:02:26] before just a prophet she was standing
[1:02:29] before a messiah she got stimulated
[1:02:33] there was a revelation that broke forth
[1:02:36] that you're beginning to realize hey
[1:02:37] this man told me everything
[1:02:40] he's exactly who he says he is amen she
[1:02:43] began to run into the city he said she'd
[1:02:46] done things unseemingly
[1:02:49] out of character for a woman of her of
[1:02:52] her type and who she was and one of her
[1:02:54] position it seemed unseemly but she
[1:02:57] became so stimulated by the Revelation
[1:03:00] that this is not just a Prophet this is
[1:03:03] the messiah
[1:03:08] hallelujah amen there ought to be the
[1:03:10] same people when you went down to a well
[1:03:13] one day and you was thirsty and you
[1:03:15] wanted to drink and you begin to realize
[1:03:16] the person talking to you was not just a
[1:03:19] preacher or not just somebody but it was
[1:03:22] Jesus speaking to you and something
[1:03:24] began to resonate hey that's the bless
[1:03:26] the truth I want to hear more about that
[1:03:29] I want to hear a man begin to make you
[1:03:31] act unseemingly
[1:03:33] you left family you left churches you
[1:03:36] left this or that and the other to find
[1:03:38] the truth
[1:03:40] because it was something stimulated you
[1:03:46] then stimulation started the way she
[1:03:48] went shouting
[1:03:50] shouting
[1:03:52] she didn't come and see what I've heard
[1:03:54] today
[1:03:56] it was great
[1:03:58] I had a good time
[1:04:00] uh
[1:04:03] she was shouting she left her old water
[1:04:05] pot and said come and see
[1:04:09] amen it caused her to act unseemingly
[1:04:12] it calls her to act unnormally
[1:04:15] amen she was changed
[1:04:22] it changed her whole thought process it
[1:04:25] changed everything about her it changed
[1:04:28] what she thought the doubt what the rest
[1:04:29] of the day was going to hold the rest of
[1:04:31] the day wasn't even important no more
[1:04:33] what was important is I need to go tell
[1:04:35] somebody to come taste what I have
[1:04:37] tasted to come see what I have saw
[1:04:43] because seed was coming to life
[1:04:47] and it was causing a stimulation on the
[1:04:49] inside oh okay
[1:04:52] it was something happening that was
[1:04:53] moving there was things that were taking
[1:04:55] place amen things were growing things
[1:04:58] were moving
[1:05:02] but here's this writer in Black
[1:05:04] Darkness
[1:05:07] been a white horse
[1:05:10] been a red horse black horse
[1:05:14] and here he is trying to put it all out
[1:05:18] blackness Darkness
[1:05:22] trying to make his last stand
[1:05:26] trying this I found light at its weakest
[1:05:29] spot
[1:05:30] I found it where it came it can't if I
[1:05:34] can just put it out it's over
[1:05:39] I found her in a weak moment
[1:05:42] and if I can just put that last little
[1:05:45] flicker of Hope out she's done
[1:05:48] if I can just put out that last little
[1:05:52] flicker
[1:05:53] trust it's over with
[1:05:56] if I can just stop it right here
[1:06:00] and he's pushing and he's blowing and
[1:06:03] he's about to make his last charge amen
[1:06:05] but all of a sudden out of the midst of
[1:06:08] the throne a voice speaks
[1:06:12] Amen brother Brown said this wasn't one
[1:06:14] of the beasts that spoke he said this
[1:06:16] was the lamb that spoke
[1:06:19] Hallelujah and the Lambs spoke and said
[1:06:21] don't hurt my all in wine
[1:06:25] don't you touch it that is mine it must
[1:06:28] go through
[1:06:31] Hallelujah why because there was a
[1:06:34] people in this age that was going to
[1:06:36] have to take a drink of it that was
[1:06:39] going to have to take the life of it
[1:06:40] that was going to have to become amen
[1:06:43] the oil in the wild would have to be
[1:06:45] poured out in this generation so there
[1:06:48] had to be oil and wine to pour out
[1:06:52] Hallelujah
[1:06:54] foreign
[1:06:57] Hallelujah
[1:07:00] he said in other words if you catch some
[1:07:02] of my little flock that's filled with my
[1:07:04] oil and wine or the pure word and you're
[1:07:06] going to kill them because you're going
[1:07:07] to do that that's what you're going to
[1:07:09] do don't you for you don't you force
[1:07:11] them to say any Hail Marys or do
[1:07:13] anything like that some of your Creeds
[1:07:14] you keep your hands off of them
[1:07:17] they know where they're going for they
[1:07:19] Anointed with my oil and being anointed
[1:07:22] my oil they have the wine of Joy because
[1:07:25] they know my Word of Promise and I'm
[1:07:28] going to raise them up again don't hurt
[1:07:30] that don't go try to messen them up just
[1:07:33] keep away from them
[1:07:37] hallelujah amen maybe you're here
[1:07:39] tonight and the devil has been trying to
[1:07:41] put out your last glimmer of hope and
[1:07:44] your last moments and your last time but
[1:07:46] there's a voice that is speaking
[1:07:49] he says don't touch them that's my all
[1:07:51] and that's my wine that's my people and
[1:07:55] they must go through
[1:07:58] they must go through there must be a
[1:08:01] people here for a body change there must
[1:08:03] be a people here for a Rapture a
[1:08:06] resurrection

[1:11:28] that's trying to put out your last
[1:11:29] flicker of Hope
[1:11:36] it's an enticing spirit
[1:11:40] that isn't trying to entice people away
[1:11:43] from the movement of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:45] and make it a cold formal religion I'm
[1:11:48] not interested in a cold form of
[1:11:50] religion you say well you're trying to
[1:11:51] make everybody shout no I'm trying to
[1:11:53] make everybody worship

[1:11:58] air and tears coming down your face and
[1:12:00] you can't say a word but just Worship in

[1:12:14] limitations upon it and say we can only
[1:12:16] do so much and put it in a box Let It Go
[1:12:21] and let it do its work
[1:12:26] he said you take
[1:12:28] a drink of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:12:32] be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:12:34] you're drunk until you leave this world
[1:12:43] now there's another woman that's drunk
[1:12:45] on the blood of the Saints
[1:12:47] she's intoxicated
[1:12:49] because of her murderous spirit
[1:12:52] murdering and killing and raping and
[1:12:54] pillaging and plundering she's drunk on
[1:12:57] it but there's also another woman that
[1:12:59] is drunk
[1:13:01] she's not drunk on her rapes and her
[1:13:03] murders and and all the all the things
[1:13:06] that she has done and that's the no
[1:13:07] she's drunk on the spirit of almighty
[1:13:09] God there's something else that is
[1:13:12] entire listen this world is intoxicated
[1:13:15] they literally have to be intoxicated to
[1:13:18] do what they're doing
[1:13:21] they're drunk on a certain drink it's a
[1:13:24] it's a spirit of laodicea
[1:13:28] and it's causing them to be blind and
[1:13:30] naked and they don't even know it
[1:13:33] that's a drunk person
[1:13:35] they totally lost all senses they
[1:13:37] totally lost everything about them they
[1:13:39] totally don't even know what's right
[1:13:41] what's wrong what's up what's down
[1:13:43] what's sensible what's not sensible
[1:13:45] they've totally lost all morals
[1:13:51] they have become drunk
[1:13:53] intoxicated and ready for Destruction
[1:13:57] but there's also another people that has
[1:14:00] also becoming drunk
[1:14:01] drunk on the holy spirit of God and it's
[1:14:04] so taken over there thinking that they
[1:14:06] can't think like this world thinks they
[1:14:08] can't think about how the things around
[1:14:10] them and all the situations they're not
[1:14:12] even concerned about that they are
[1:14:14] intoxicated for a Rapture for leaving
[1:14:18] here for it going away
[1:14:19] [Applause]
[1:14:26] it's a constant intoxication
[1:14:30] he said well I don't feel very
[1:14:31] intoxicated we'll take another drink
[1:14:36] it's a constant stimulation
[1:14:40] that's a quote I'm not coming
[1:14:44] it's a constant stimulation
[1:14:48] well I don't feel very
[1:14:50] joyful we'll take another drink
[1:14:55] it's Unlimited Supply
[1:14:57] if you ain't drunk it's your fault
[1:15:00] yeah if you ain't intoxicated it's your
[1:15:03] problem your fault
[1:15:05] it ain't because it's not there
[1:15:09] it ain't because it ain't affordable
[1:15:11] it's been made affordable it's been made
[1:15:13] free by the blood of Jesus Christ he
[1:15:16] gave his life and he shed it so his
[1:15:18] Spirit could be let loose amen we have
[1:15:21] the ability to get drunk
[1:15:26] well it might make me act a certain way
[1:15:28] well
[1:15:30] if you're worried about that you ain't
[1:15:31] never got to worry about getting drunk
[1:15:34] because you're worried about that more
[1:15:36] than being drunk
[1:15:38] but a person that's a real Drinker he
[1:15:40] don't care what he acts like after he
[1:15:41] gets drunk
[1:15:43] he don't care
[1:15:46] he could care less he could care less of
[1:15:49] what's going on around him once he's
[1:15:51] drunk
[1:15:57] they ain't a drunk person right now if
[1:16:00] you find a real drunk that could care
[1:16:02] anything about what happened yesterday
[1:16:04] in the elections
[1:16:08] they could care less red blue all I see
[1:16:11] is another bottle
[1:16:15] that's all he's interested in because
[1:16:16] he's a real drunk
[1:16:19] well there's some people in this world
[1:16:20] there's also a bunch of real drunks
[1:16:26] you're making me nervous I don't know
[1:16:27] about that brother
[1:16:29] there's a constant stimulation it's a
[1:16:33] constant intoxication drunk day and
[1:16:36] night that's the word of God
[1:16:43] hallelujah amen to yourself I don't feel
[1:16:46] it well take another drag
[1:16:49] start pulling some more in and say God I
[1:16:52] need more of you
[1:17:00] now the power of Revelation brings
[1:17:02] stimulation to the believer for the
[1:17:05] power of why natural wine is to
[1:17:07] stimulate is to bring a person that's
[1:17:09] all slumped down to stimulation
[1:17:13] man well I just I
[1:17:17] I was singing my own good song for
[1:17:19] somebody to slumped down I'm depressed
[1:17:22] I'm depressed
[1:17:24] every day that I live I'm depressed
[1:17:29] when I wake up in the morning when I lay
[1:17:31] my head to rest I'll kill myself I'll
[1:17:33] kill myself
[1:17:36] you're drunk on the wrong thing
[1:17:41] but if you start taking a drink
[1:17:44] and you start drinking in the word of
[1:17:46] God and you begin to realize oh oh look
[1:17:50] at there that's me right there mama mama
[1:17:52] that's me right there I'm blessed I am
[1:17:55] blessed every day that I live I am
[1:17:58] blessed
[1:17:59] doesn't matter if a democrat or a
[1:18:02] republican is in power I am blessed
[1:18:06] doesn't matter what's going
[1:18:08] on me I'm blessed it doesn't matter
[1:18:10] what's happening in the church I'm
[1:18:13] blessed
[1:18:17] Hallelujah
[1:18:18] is there any more blast Among Us you
[1:18:21] realize God is in our midst we're
[1:18:23] blessed God is healing us we're blessed
[1:18:26] God is saving our children we're blessed
[1:18:29] God is moving among us we're blessed
[1:18:33] God is putting families back together
[1:18:35] we're blessed
[1:18:39] is bringing the last ones there we're
[1:18:42] blessed any moment now the dead in
[1:18:45] Christ is going to rise I'm blessed
[1:18:49] it causes a stimulation of Revelation
[1:18:55] something on the inside when you realize
[1:18:58] I'm not going down I'm going up
[1:19:03] I wasn't born to be defeated I was born
[1:19:06] to defeat devils and run over hell and
[1:19:09] not let hell run over me
[1:19:11] [Applause]
[1:19:17] it's like the story of that Mouse
[1:19:20] foreign
[1:19:22] got chased around by that cat
[1:19:25] because I'm gonna kill you every corner
[1:19:28] I got you grabbing at his tail grabbing
[1:19:31] at this first thing you know that cat
[1:19:33] reached come over the counter jumped off
[1:19:36] fell into a wine jug
[1:19:39] yeah that Mouse did well until he
[1:19:42] thought it was a cat after he got
[1:19:43] through I guess
[1:19:47] that Mouse fell over that wine jug
[1:19:49] and he about drowned in that thing
[1:19:52] that's what you want you want some wine
[1:19:55] you can drown in
[1:19:57] not just some wine you can get your feet
[1:19:59] wet some wine you can just about drown
[1:20:02] in because the other way the only way to
[1:20:04] keep from drowning in it is to drink it
[1:20:08] and he starts drinking and he kind of
[1:20:09] blue
[1:20:11] finally he used to get so stimulated he
[1:20:14] forgot he was a mouse he pulled himself
[1:20:16] up and he looked over that old line that
[1:20:19] old lid of that jar and he looks at
[1:20:21] where that cat at now
[1:20:24] the story don't change
[1:20:26] he then got stimulated enough to believe
[1:20:29] I can whoop that cat
[1:20:32] I can beat that cat that cat ain't gonna
[1:20:34] beat me I'm gonna be that
[1:20:37] I'll come on somebody if you'll get
[1:20:40] stimulated and drunk enough you'll
[1:20:42] realize that depression ain't gonna
[1:20:43] defeat me I'm going to defeat it
[1:20:46] that's suicide ain't taking my life I'm
[1:20:48] gonna overcome it
[1:20:51] cause you've been drinking on the word
[1:20:53] of God
[1:20:55] and it stimulated you enough to your
[1:20:57] faith muscles began to pop out and you
[1:21:00] realize where's that devil at now it's
[1:21:02] meant to torment my child where is he at
[1:21:05] that's been destroying my family I'm
[1:21:07] here to take charge
[1:21:08] [Applause]
[1:21:12] it brings a person that's all slumped
[1:21:15] down to stimulation
[1:21:19] so in other words it gets you out of
[1:21:21] your slump
[1:21:26] Hallelujah
[1:21:28] that's a good one right there get out
[1:21:29] get out of your slump
[1:21:31] been in a slump
[1:21:36] hello
[1:21:37] it was a slump brother Timmy well it's
[1:21:39] kind of like a guy's trying to hit a
[1:21:41] baseball and he can't you know they call
[1:21:42] him they say he's in a slump he ain't
[1:21:44] hit nothing in a while
[1:21:47] hold for three one night over four the
[1:21:49] other night oh for five the next night
[1:21:51] over whatever
[1:21:52] o for L for over
[1:21:56] that sounds like a bowl for me over
[1:21:59] you
[1:22:01] brother Jewel would say wowzy wowzy
[1:22:04] booze
[1:22:06] I'm in a slump get out of it
[1:22:09] how do you get out of it you drink your
[1:22:11] way out of it
[1:22:15] I ain't talking about down at Dixie end
[1:22:17] either
[1:22:21] you drink your way out of it
[1:22:23] this is untapped resources
[1:22:28] there's bottles that the lids ain't even
[1:22:30] been taken off of yet they're just
[1:22:32] waiting for you to reach away
[1:22:33] foreign
[1:22:41] listen to Drunk if he's a real drunk he
[1:22:43] wants to be a real good drunk
[1:22:46] you know how to cure a good hangover get
[1:22:49] drunk again
[1:22:51] I'm talking spiritually now
[1:22:57] get drunk again
[1:23:01] the word gives stimulation of Joy to the
[1:23:04] believer
[1:23:05] stimulation of satisfaction
[1:23:09] I'm satisfied I need the right sister
[1:23:11] Phillip I'm satisfied
[1:23:14] amen it brings stimulation that is
[1:23:17] Vindicated as prude it called in the
[1:23:20] scriptures that we want to refer to it a
[1:23:21] new wine these are drunk on new wine but
[1:23:24] really it should be a spiritual wine
[1:23:27] a spiritual wine as the natural line
[1:23:30] reveals itself and stimulated power so
[1:23:33] does the spiritual wine as this reveals
[1:23:36] the word of God which is Spirit the word
[1:23:38] itself is spirit and it begins to reveal
[1:23:41] itself and it's the spirit that
[1:23:43] quickeneth or makes alive it's the flesh
[1:23:47] profit and nothing but the words that I
[1:23:48] speak to you they are spirit and they
[1:23:51] are life
[1:23:54] there's a quickening power that comes
[1:23:56] with it
[1:23:57] it's not a dead Creed
[1:24:02] the word itself is Spirit
[1:24:04] it's spirit in word form
[1:24:07] when it's quickened or brought to life
[1:24:09] the spirit of the word goes to work and
[1:24:11] it acts
[1:24:12] a thought has to be a thought before it
[1:24:14] can be a word
[1:24:16] when that when when that thought is
[1:24:18] presented it's a word
[1:24:20] God thought that he hadn't had in his
[1:24:22] place in his word and then we received
[1:24:24] it from him it becomes word god revealed
[1:24:26] to Moses what to do God spoke it and it
[1:24:29] happened and it begins to stimulate it
[1:24:31] begins to give joy because the word of
[1:24:33] God the new wine the spiritual wine
[1:24:35] stimulates and when it reveals the word
[1:24:37] then it brings Joy beyond measure
[1:24:40] sometimes it brings just such joy to you
[1:24:43] just get over flooded
[1:24:48] oh
[1:24:49] it ain't a little Trickle
[1:24:51] a little sprinkle
[1:24:53] a little dot hearing it no you get over
[1:24:57] flooded
[1:25:00] David said my cup overfloweth
[1:25:04] it runs over
[1:25:06] he said I know there's a lot of
[1:25:07] fanaticism people carrying on sometimes
[1:25:09] they do it when the music's jumping up
[1:25:11] and down and everything I know that goes
[1:25:13] on I believe that too I've seen people
[1:25:16] in the day when as long as the music's
[1:25:18] playing everybody's jumping and
[1:25:19] screaming when the music stop they stop
[1:25:21] that's that's still all right as far as
[1:25:23] I'm concerned
[1:25:26] people apparently don't read that part
[1:25:31] that's all still all right as far as I'm
[1:25:33] concerned as long as people lives right
[1:25:39] Hallelujah but you start bringing the
[1:25:42] word now that brings actually brings
[1:25:43] life is the word that brings the joy of
[1:25:47] stimulation of new wine and that's what
[1:25:50] it was on Pentecost on Pentecost when
[1:25:52] the word was Vindicated
[1:25:55] he said behold I send to you uh my
[1:25:58] promise of my father in New York but you
[1:26:00] go into Jerusalem and wait until
[1:26:06] amen Joel 2 28 he finds out he's going
[1:26:09] to pour out his spirit in Isaiah 28 and
[1:26:11] verse 19. then be stammer and lips and
[1:26:13] other tongues and all these things and
[1:26:15] somehow that's not even preached no more
[1:26:23] but it's right there in the seals
[1:26:28] one said well maybe we've waited long
[1:26:30] enough let's just accept it by faith
[1:26:33] let's just believe the message and we're
[1:26:36] saved
[1:26:38] that's what they that's what he just
[1:26:40] said let's just believe the message that
[1:26:42] he spoke and we're okay
[1:26:45] no no you got to have more than that he
[1:26:47] said that's a good Baptist Doctrine
[1:26:50] it didn't work with them brothers so the
[1:26:52] first thing you know it had to become a
[1:26:54] reality they waited on their Ministry
[1:26:57] for the word to be Vindicated and when
[1:26:59] you come to seek the Holy Spirit you do
[1:27:03] the same
[1:27:05] you wait until yes you can accept it by
[1:27:09] faith you can have you have to accept
[1:27:11] Christ by faith that's exactly right you
[1:27:13] accept the Holy Spirit by faith but let
[1:27:16] the Holy Spirit come and give the
[1:27:18] circumcision as a witness he's accepted
[1:27:21] your faith
[1:27:24] hello somebody we get to the Exception
[1:27:26] by faith I believe the message I'm
[1:27:28] saying I believe Brother Brad is a
[1:27:30] prophet and I'm saying no you're not
[1:27:32] you're not saved unless he comes and
[1:27:35] gives you that seal of circumcision
[1:27:38] to show you your faith has been accepted
[1:27:43] Abraham believed God was imputed him for
[1:27:45] righteous but God gave him the sign of
[1:27:48] circumcision
[1:27:50] as a confirmation he had accepted his
[1:27:53] faith so it's the same thing with us we
[1:27:56] must wait unto the Holy Spirit has done
[1:27:58] something
[1:28:01] not necessarily because we spoke in
[1:28:02] tongues or not because we danced or got
[1:28:04] emotional we shouted until we're changed
[1:28:08] until something actually happened I
[1:28:12] don't care what for me comes in just so
[1:28:15] it happens that's the main thing
[1:28:20] I believe in speaking in tongues but
[1:28:23] Brandon there's a lot of people in this
[1:28:25] message that don't
[1:28:27] but he did all those things other things
[1:28:30] that are all right it just that but just
[1:28:33] that in itself won't work you know it
[1:28:35] won't work so it doesn't do it I've seen
[1:28:37] witches speak in tongues lay a pencil
[1:28:39] down right another tongue somebody
[1:28:40] interpret it tell the truth wrote just
[1:28:42] exactly how it happened I've seen him
[1:28:44] throw Dustin ahead cut themselves a
[1:28:45] knife covered all the blood of the
[1:28:46] wildebeest or something calling the
[1:28:48] devil a hunt speaking of tongue doesn't
[1:28:50] do it though I speak of tongues of men
[1:28:52] and Angel and have not charity it
[1:28:53] probably nothing though I could do it so
[1:28:55] those sayings don't mean that you have
[1:28:57] the Holy Spirit but when he the person
[1:28:59] The Immortal Spirit of Christ becomes
[1:29:02] your personal Savior and changes you
[1:29:07] and changes you and puts your views
[1:29:10] right straight towards Calvary to its
[1:29:13] word then something has happened
[1:29:15] something is happening no one will have
[1:29:18] to tell you about it you'll know it's
[1:29:20] happened
[1:29:23] and when this new wine brings revelation
[1:29:26] when it's revealed that's the way it was
[1:29:28] on Pentecost
[1:29:29] they knew
[1:29:31] that there was supposed to be a spirit
[1:29:32] poured out upon them and they waited
[1:29:34] till this happened
[1:29:38] till this happened
[1:29:43] so something that happens is an
[1:29:45] experience
[1:29:46] till this happened and when the
[1:29:49] Vindication of Revelation took place
[1:29:51] then stimulation was upon them sure did
[1:29:53] they steamed up too right out in the
[1:29:55] streets they were where they were as
[1:29:57] afraid before and had the doors shut
[1:29:59] there they went out in the streets
[1:30:00] they'd been afraid to a group of people
[1:30:02] preaching the gospel to here they begin
[1:30:03] to preach gospel to them something that
[1:30:05] happened because the True Word of
[1:30:07] Promise had been Vindicated all right
[1:30:09] then Pentecost had Beyond Joy
[1:30:14] they was really stimulated he said I
[1:30:17] think it does anyone just take a just
[1:30:20] take a moment just think about David
[1:30:21] when he got all stimulated too he said
[1:30:24] my cup runneth over he'd had a great
[1:30:26] event that's like what caused him to do
[1:30:28] that was when he saw the word Ben
[1:30:31] returned again is when he got a glimpse
[1:30:34] of calvary
[1:30:37] and he saw the lamb hanging there and he
[1:30:40] saw him go down into hell but he said
[1:30:42] they will not leave my soul in Hell
[1:30:43] neither you suffer your hold on a secret
[1:30:45] ruption I tell you his cup got to run it
[1:30:48] over because he seen no matter what God
[1:30:51] was going to rise up
[1:30:53] he's saying the resurrection and his cup
[1:30:56] began to run over
[1:30:58] but he went through another dry spell
[1:31:01] in second Samuel they had taken the ark
[1:31:04] and the enemy had come in and took it
[1:31:09] we know the story they tried to hold on
[1:31:12] to it he said but it was too hot for
[1:31:13] them to hold
[1:31:16] he said they're God Dagan fell on his
[1:31:19] face and broke into pieces in front of
[1:31:21] it they tried it's the hottest thing
[1:31:23] they ever had on their hands they
[1:31:25] couldn't get rid of it fast enough they
[1:31:28] put it on an ox cart
[1:31:35] and started back and when David saw the
[1:31:38] art coming you know what he did he got
[1:31:41] so full of stimulation
[1:31:44] he seen the word being revealed back to
[1:31:46] Israel again
[1:31:48] and he danced in the spirit all around
[1:31:50] and around and around his cup got to run
[1:31:53] it over why he saw the word hadn't
[1:31:56] returned into his place
[1:31:59] he said I think that would make anybody
[1:32:03] get a little stimulated when they see
[1:32:06] after all of these years
[1:32:09] the true word has been Vindicated and is
[1:32:13] put back in his place again what a time
[1:32:16] we're living in
[1:32:18] [Applause]
[1:32:20] a time we're living in church we're not
[1:32:22] living under some man's Creeds or some
[1:32:24] man Dogma but we have fully witnessed
[1:32:27] the word has returned back again to its
[1:32:31] rightful place and his rightful position
[1:32:33] and everything has been put back the
[1:32:36] altar has been rebuilt
[1:32:39] the fire has come down and consumed the
[1:32:42] altar again and we have saw it and been
[1:32:45] Vindicated right before our very eyes
[1:32:47] and we're supposed to sit around like a
[1:32:49] bunch of bumps on the log nose sir no
[1:32:51] red no way no how not today tomorrow or
[1:32:54] any other day I've seen God Vindicated
[1:32:57] in this church again I've seen him
[1:32:59] moving like he said he would move I've
[1:33:01] seen him falling like he said he would
[1:33:03] fall I seen him free and delivering like
[1:33:05] he said he would I've seen Jesus Christ
[1:33:07] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:33:10] right here Among Us walking up and down
[1:33:13] these aisles changing hearts and
[1:33:15] changing lives
[1:33:17] it causes something on the inside of me
[1:33:20] to say that's him
[1:33:22] that's him that's not just a man that's
[1:33:26] God himself
[1:33:28] moving and vindicating himself Among Us
[1:33:35] what a mighty God we serve
