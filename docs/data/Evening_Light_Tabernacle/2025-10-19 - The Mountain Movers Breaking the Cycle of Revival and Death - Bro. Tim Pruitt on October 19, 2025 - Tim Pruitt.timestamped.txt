[36:55] That's just the way it is. Sing it
[36:58] again. You are not a god.
[37:00] [Music]
[37:03] &gt;&gt; God
[37:05] created
[37:07] by human hands.

[37:13] depending
[37:15] &gt;&gt; on any
[37:17] you are not a god
[37:18] &gt;&gt; not a god in need of anything we can
[37:24] give

[37:28] &gt;&gt; that's just the way it is.
[37:33] Oh, you are God alone

[40:10] [Music]
[40:12] Unshakeable.
[40:15] You are unstoppable.
[40:18] That's what you are. Oh, unshakeable.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Unshakeable.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Unshakeable.

[41:52] &gt;&gt; Yes,

[41:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[42:01] Praise the Lord.
[42:03] Oh, God. You are on your throne.
[42:06] [Music]
[42:08] &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful you made a way for
[42:11] us to approach it.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Not in terror, not in fear, but Lord, a
[42:18] way to approach it
[42:21] [Music]
[42:23] where we are welcome,
[42:25] invited,
[42:27] loved,
[42:29] and heard.
[42:31] Lord, thank you for your children today
[42:34] that have gathered here with us.
[42:37] Thank you for your blessings that you've
[42:39] poured out upon us, Lord, and the
[42:42] wonderful meetings that we've had here
[42:44] and
[42:46] that we just come through, Lord. The
[42:47] great times together,
[42:50] the wonderful service Wednesday night
[42:52] and now today. We come here on this day
[42:57] to give you praise, to give you glory,
[42:59] to give you honor. because there's just
[43:02] nobody like you
[43:05] and we worship you. And if we can't,
[43:10] Lord, from the depths of our hearts, we
[43:13] want to just truly say that we love you.
[43:17] We're thankful for the grace in our
[43:20] lives, for the mercy, Lord, that
[43:23] endures,
[43:24] for healing that is ours,
[43:27] and that you hear our petitions,
[43:30] Lord, when we come before your throne.
[43:33] Lord, we want to bring our brother Kenny
[43:35] Camp before you today.
[43:38] who just wrote me said, "I'd love to be
[43:40] there, but
[43:43] infirmities, pain, just keep him from
[43:46] coming." Lord, I pray God you'll help
[43:49] our brother. Our sister Jeanie will get
[43:52] her report this week. Lord, I I just
[43:55] pray for a good report. But no matter
[43:57] what the doctors say, we look to your
[44:00] report. For you said, "Who hath believed
[44:02] our report? And to whom is the arm of
[44:05] the Lord revealed?" And certainly we've
[44:07] seen your arm revealed in this day
[44:10] bringing healing and deliverance,
[44:13] salvation in your mighty name. Lord, I
[44:16] pray dear God that you'll just touch
[44:18] your people. Lord, whatever the needs
[44:20] are, our brother Aaron, the upcoming
[44:22] surgery he'll have, Lord, I I pray
[44:24] you'll be with him. Lord, the needs of
[44:27] your peoples, those that are homesick,
[44:29] those that are traveling home today, and
[44:32] oh God, that's been away. I I pray that
[44:34] they would had a blessed time and that
[44:37] you'll bring them back safely, Father.
[44:39] Father, they've had ones different
[44:42] meetings and beautiful weekend and some
[44:45] have gone away and Lord, I just pray
[44:48] you'll bless them in a special way. But
[44:50] us here this morning that have gathered
[44:53] together in your name, I pray that
[44:55] you'll minister to ever so personally
[44:58] that you'll be a personal God to
[45:00] everyone. Lord, if necessary, Lord, that
[45:05] you'll as it was walk out from this
[45:07] pullpit down to their pew and speak to
[45:10] them in a personal way. Lord, I ask in
[45:13] Jesus name, you who discerns the
[45:15] thoughts and intents of heart the word
[45:18] that you'll take over and you'll speak
[45:21] to your children in a special way, bless
[45:24] the word as we read it. Supply the needs
[45:26] of your children and encourage us all in
[45:29] Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[45:34] My It's good to be in the house of the
[45:36] Lord today. And we want to give you a
[45:39] greetings and welcome and um just so
[45:43] glad that you're here today. And I hope
[45:46] if you are a visitor here, you won't
[45:47] feel like one when you leave, but you'll
[45:49] just feel a part with us.
[45:52] And uh you know, brother Timothy and I
[45:55] are headed to France. Thank you. We're
[45:57] headed to France this week and and we
[46:00] have meetings there. I just wanted to
[46:02] say, you know, the meetings here were
[46:04] for the of our October meetings. They
[46:07] were just over the top. I'm still feast
[46:09] feasting on them.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; So many deliverances, so many victories.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; So many held hostage by sin or sickness
[46:19] that were released.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm glad for that. And we just
[46:24] pray that God's blessings will continue.
[46:26] And if the Lord touched your life that
[46:29] you will just use that to build on that
[46:32] and to go forward in him. You know, I I
[46:35] I I wish everybody was here so that I
[46:38] could really uh give a proper expression
[46:42] of my appreciation to each one that
[46:47] labored so faithfully during our
[46:49] meetings. and you know your love for the
[46:52] Lord, your dedication to his house have
[46:55] been a true testimony of Christian
[46:57] service and we saw that in action and we
[47:00] so appreciate it. You know, we had so
[47:02] much that was accomplished. Um, I I I
[47:06] probably will leave out something that
[47:08] is probably that I probably should
[47:11] really have paid attention to or or
[47:14] brought brought out in this, but you
[47:17] know, there's just things that were done
[47:19] like the painting of all the doors of
[47:21] the church and, you know, something that
[47:24] I wanted done, the refurbishing of the
[47:26] servant bars with their beautiful new
[47:29] tops and and then, you know, the the
[47:32] sound panels. Uh did you enjoy that
[47:34] better in the fellowship hall there
[47:36] where it was uh not as noisy and and you
[47:39] could fellowship a little better and and
[47:42] of course you know then the the things
[47:44] we've done here on the platform uh
[47:46] constructing the new cabinet wall and
[47:49] and um that just was superb. So just
[47:54] just exactly what we needed. Others gave
[47:57] hours to cleaning and power washing and
[48:00] softwashing the buildings and you know
[48:03] it just ensuring everything looked
[48:05] excellent and it did and um we've had
[48:08] the platform music area rearranged with
[48:11] a lot of care and and um it just to me
[48:15] just created a a fresh atmosphere for
[48:17] worship and um and of course uh I don't
[48:22] know if you noticed or not but they did
[48:25] something for the the youth
[48:26] there. Um they put time and energy in a
[48:30] little whiffle ball field out here and
[48:32] bringing in sand and leveling the
[48:34] ground. You know, when we had the old
[48:36] church back um way out in the back woods
[48:40] and we were landlocked, I kept being
[48:42] asked over and over, we need someplace
[48:45] for our children to to to play and to do
[48:48] something. You know, they're running
[48:50] between the cars and it's dangerous and
[48:52] all of that. Can't you do something? and
[48:54] I couldn't create land and it was always
[48:57] frustrating to me because couldn't
[48:59] provide that but you know here we've
[49:02] been blessed and we have abundance and
[49:06] uh 40 acres here that the Lord provided
[49:08] us and then you know you know I I want
[49:12] to just compliment you on your
[49:13] hospitality
[49:15] um where many things happened behind the
[49:17] scenes you know it you go to naming
[49:20] names why you'd have to name the whole
[49:21] church cuz everybody did something and
[49:24] you provided meals and gave hospitality.
[49:28] I believe that reflects the heart of
[49:30] Christ. And uh we had those sack lunches
[49:34] after service. And while the the the
[49:37] fellowship meal we had on Sunday and and
[49:40] the food that was prepared for and then
[49:43] others brought food, prepared food for
[49:46] for those that were hosting visitors in
[49:47] their homes. And I was a recipient of
[49:50] that too as the ministry stayed with me.
[49:53] and they provided welcome packages and
[49:57] arranged transportation to and fro from
[50:00] the the airport and others just opened
[50:04] up their homes to guests and you just
[50:06] did every kind of things to make
[50:08] everything run smoothly and and and I
[50:11] want to say thank you every act, every
[50:14] touch, every detail.
[50:16] I may not speak about it this morning,
[50:18] but it was noticed and and and if I
[50:21] didn't see it, God did
[50:23] &gt;&gt; and it's so deeply appreciated. So, you
[50:27] know, as we as I say today, thank you
[50:30] Evening Light Tabernacle for your your
[50:32] great spirit of excellence and your
[50:35] unity, your love, and you made this
[50:37] pastor very proud and uh and I'm so
[50:41] thankful beyond words. God bless you.
[50:44] And today I want you to turn with me to
[50:47] the scripture to Revelation chapter 2
[50:50] and we'll read from the fourth verse.
[50:53] And um you know we we do know we got
[50:56] more than half of or at least half the
[50:58] church gone this this uh weekend. And uh
[51:03] and so you know just because half of
[51:07] them are gone don't mean I'm preaching
[51:08] half of a sermon.
[51:12] So, you know, I I always um kind of made
[51:17] it my motto, you know, when I one time
[51:20] preached to a group of a little group
[51:22] over in I think it was Mississippi of
[51:24] about six or seven people and my wife
[51:27] and I was one of them six and seven and
[51:29] and I preached to them just like I would
[51:31] a thousand because I figured if God
[51:34] couldn't trust me to do my best with
[51:38] five or six or seven, he sure couldn't
[51:40] trust trust me with a thousand. So, you
[51:43] know, we put all of our heart into it
[51:45] every time. And so, you know, you can
[51:49] for those that are not here with us,
[51:50] well, you can make up for their absence
[51:53] by being present.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. By giving your attention and um by
[52:00] responding to the word of God.
[52:02] Revelation chapter 2 and 4.
[52:04] Nevertheless, I have somewhat against
[52:07] thee because thou has left thy first
[52:12] love.
[52:13] God bless you. You can be seated.
[52:17] Now, I'm speaking today from a scripture
[52:20] that started the slide towards the fall
[52:22] of the church. And this is also the
[52:26] pattern every revival has followed. And
[52:30] I'm going to be speaking on breaking the
[52:32] cycle of revival and death. So we so
[52:36] it's a pattern of course that is
[52:39] repeated itself through church history
[52:42] from the days of Ephesus until now. As
[52:45] you know, the the church would begin
[52:49] with fire and with power and with a and
[52:51] with purity. And it was birthed that the
[52:54] church at Ephesus was birthed through
[52:57] the ministry of the apostle Paul, the
[53:00] the very messenger who received the
[53:02] revelation of the church as the body of
[53:05] Christ. And under that anointing, the
[53:08] scripture tells us that they labored,
[53:11] they endured, they tested false apostles
[53:15] and they stood against evil. So there
[53:17] was a lot of good that they did and and
[53:20] and the and God acknowledged that as he
[53:23] said, I know thy works and thy labor and
[53:26] thy patience. Yet that same voice had to
[53:31] cry out and and and in the same moment
[53:34] give it a complaint. You know, they
[53:36] said, "Nevertheless, I have somewhat
[53:39] against thee because thou has left thy
[53:42] first love." You see, Ephesus was a
[53:45] church that aimed high. But of course,
[53:48] we know they relaxed. And what began in
[53:50] power of the spirit, it it slowly just
[53:53] cooled off to formality and tradition.
[53:57] uh they had that labor, works and
[54:00] patience but left the first love and and
[54:02] that that same cycle of revival was was
[54:08] followed by decline. And this has
[54:10] repeated itself in every age. I could
[54:14] actually go from Genesis where the
[54:16] presence of God was there and and see
[54:19] them decline there and lose the the the
[54:22] spirit and not have the walk with God.
[54:24] And we could take every generation,
[54:27] whether it be the generation of Noah or
[54:29] the generation of of Abraham or or or
[54:33] where they would degenerate down in
[54:36] Egypt. And we could spend a lot of time
[54:38] on these cycles that has happened
[54:41] throughout history. And uh but let me
[54:44] tell you something. According to the
[54:45] word of God, the church that Jesus
[54:48] planted on the day of Pentecost will not
[54:51] end in crop failure.
[54:54] You see, the Bible said, "The husband
[54:56] waiteth for the the precious fruit of
[54:59] the earth and hath long patience for
[55:02] it." And neither will it harvest
[55:04] something different than what the son of
[55:06] man planted. Because the law of God
[55:09] stands true that whatever you sow, that
[55:11] which you you will reap. And and God
[55:14] does not sow wheat to reap weeds.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; So, he's going to have a crop in this
[55:20] end time. He does not plan a bride in
[55:23] Pentecostal fire and then have his
[55:25] church stand in ashes.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; And fact of the matter is he says
[55:30] contrarywise prophecy tells us in Hagi 2
[55:33] and9 the glory of this latter house
[55:35] shall be greater than the farmer.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; So the bride will not end in decay in in
[55:42] Leodysian lukewarmness. She will be
[55:45] transformed by the same spirit that fell
[55:48] at Pentecost as the hearts of the
[55:51] children are being turned back to the
[55:53] faith of the apostolic fathers.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; So she began with the outpouring of the
[55:58] Holy Ghost and and she will finish with
[56:01] the same fire, the same faith, the same
[56:04] life that came that day in the upper
[56:07] room. But we are living now in the final
[56:10] moments of the last church age
[56:13] which is le oazia which Jesus said the
[56:16] church would be lukewarm
[56:20] but not everybody. Thank God. That's
[56:22] right.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I hear brother Brandham saying is
[56:24] but this bride will not be a le oysia.
[56:28] She will be by no means be lukewarm.
[56:32] For at the same time though that this is
[56:35] the the hour of the res restoration of
[56:38] all things. This is this is not the time
[56:41] to drift into spiritual death but rather
[56:45] the time that we must press into
[56:49] resurrection life cuz this is an hour
[56:52] like no other hour. This is resurrection
[56:56] hour. And the Apostle Paul warned us in
[56:59] the scripture. He said, "In the last
[57:01] days, perilous times shall come." And
[57:05] you look around and there's wars and
[57:07] there's famine and there's moral decay
[57:09] and plagues that are shaking the
[57:12] nations. And these are tribulation,
[57:15] pre-tribulation birth painans of a world
[57:18] that is in travail because we know it's
[57:21] going to give birth to a new to a new
[57:24] earth. And so we have all kinds of
[57:27] things that are happening. There are
[57:29] earthquakes and new diseases and mass
[57:32] incarceration and mental anguish and
[57:35] threats of nuclear destruction. And they
[57:38] all testify of a world that today is
[57:42] staggered in judgment.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "As it was in the days
[57:48] of Sodom before it's burning, so shall
[57:51] it be in the days of the Son of Man."
[57:54] And we're living in that time. But even
[57:57] in this dark hour, the spirit of God is
[58:00] calling on the people to break the
[58:02] cycle, to refuse to cool off, to rise up
[58:06] to be a glorious church without spot
[58:10] wrinkle. Amen. Having no such thing. You
[58:13] see, because she'll be a pure
[58:16] unadulterated word bride. The fire that
[58:20] fell at Pentecost, it was not given just
[58:22] to burn for one generation. I want you
[58:24] to remember it was to lie to every one
[58:27] of the seven ages. It was meant to burn
[58:30] until the coming of the Lord and through
[58:33] other though other generations let it
[58:36] burn out. We must not.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; And this is our calling. And and in this
[58:42] call is a call to rekindle the flame, to
[58:45] guard the oil, to walk in the spirit
[58:49] until the trumpet announces the approach
[58:52] of the bridegroom for the meeting in the
[58:54] air. It is important to do as the
[58:57] scripture said, to be watchful and to
[59:00] strengthen the things which remain
[59:03] because we got a world today that is
[59:05] spiraling into confusion. Amen. and and
[59:09] it seemed like to them there is no
[59:12] answer. And the voices of religious
[59:15] leaders who were once trusted have grown
[59:18] vain and powerless. Whether it be the
[59:21] those polished crusades of of Billy
[59:24] Graham or those of the healer revival of
[59:27] Or Roberts, the denominational heads of
[59:30] vast church systems, none of them hold
[59:33] the remedy for this dying age.
[59:38] Whether it doesn't matter where you
[59:39] look, whether it's the evangelicals, the
[59:41] charismatics, the reformers, they're all
[59:44] searching and they're all failing to
[59:46] bring the world back to God. And even
[59:49] the pope will wrestle to restrain the
[59:53] sins that is in his own priesthood. The
[59:56] shelves line our Christian bookstores
[59:59] and they overflow with millions of books
[1:00:02] and every one of them are promising
[1:00:04] solutions. There's even a new breed of
[1:00:07] preachers flocking like vultures on a
[1:00:09] dying corpse claiming something
[1:00:12] different from the Acts 2 experience.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; As Jeremiah said, yet none of them can
[1:00:18] heal the wound of the daughter of Zion.
[1:00:21] None of them have the remedy.
[1:00:24] As Jesus said, the blind leaders of the
[1:00:27] blind and if they blind lead the blind,
[1:00:30] both shall fall in the ditch.
[1:00:33] So we live in a world today, a church
[1:00:35] world that mirrors Sodom, is blind, is
[1:00:39] corrupt, it's groping for the door while
[1:00:42] judgment is ready to fall.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; And we we live in a time where the moral
[1:00:47] decay is undeniable.
[1:00:50] Why? In 1960, there were like 393
[1:00:54] divorces here in America. By 1999, that
[1:00:58] number had exploded to 1.2 million.
[1:01:02] In in 2025, the number of divorces
[1:01:06] recorded in America was was 672,52
[1:01:13] divorces and enolments.
[1:01:15] Now, you might think that the numbers
[1:01:18] have dropped. Well, Brother Tim, they've
[1:01:20] dropped. We're improving. They've
[1:01:23] dropped now by nearly a half a million
[1:01:26] or more. But here's what's really
[1:01:28] happening behind the numbers. And it's a
[1:01:31] very sobering picture when you look at
[1:01:33] the moral and the spiritual condition of
[1:01:36] society. You see in 1970 there were 2.2
[1:01:40] million marriages in the US. By 2023
[1:01:45] that had dropped to 1.8 million
[1:01:48] marriages even though the population
[1:01:51] grew by over 100 million.
[1:01:54] So fewer so fewer marriages mean fewer
[1:01:59] divorces
[1:02:01] not because the righteousness is rising
[1:02:03] but because commitment is failing.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And cohabitation has replaced
[1:02:10] marriage for many and you know it's sin.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; One research reports that the number of
[1:02:17] unmarried couples living together has
[1:02:20] more than tripled since 1990.
[1:02:23] About 60% of adults under 35, the age of
[1:02:27] 35 now say cohabitation is acceptable
[1:02:30] even without marriage. Many couples
[1:02:33] simply separate rather than divorce and
[1:02:36] choose another partner a partner which
[1:02:38] never shows up in these stats.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; So you see it's a time like in the book
[1:02:43] of Judges, every man is doing what is
[1:02:47] right in his own eyes.
[1:02:52] And this is one of the clearest signs of
[1:02:55] the Leodysian spirit of compromise.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; It's a it's a world wanting love without
[1:03:01] covenant.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; They want pleasure without purity. They
[1:03:06] want security without surrender.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; So while divorce numbers look lower, the
[1:03:12] real picture is that society has drifted
[1:03:15] further away from the sacredness of
[1:03:18] marriage than ever before. In fact of
[1:03:21] the matter, they have made it a joke for
[1:03:24] just anybody. You could, you know, you
[1:03:26] could, my goodness, almost to the point
[1:03:28] you can marry your dog. There's no
[1:03:30] sacredness.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; You see, and and and and if that ain't
[1:03:35] enough, people aren't keeping their
[1:03:36] vows.
[1:03:38] They just simply avoid them all
[1:03:40] together.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; And the breakdown of marriage is not
[1:03:43] just a social issue. I want you to know
[1:03:46] it's a spiritual crisis.
[1:03:49] And it affects churches. It affects
[1:03:51] homes. It affects nations. And when when
[1:03:55] a generation stops making covenant, it
[1:03:58] loses its understanding of God's
[1:04:01] covenant love. As the Bible said, and I
[1:04:04] want you to get this, in the last days,
[1:04:07] men shall be lovers of their own selves
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; without natural affections, truth
[1:04:14] breakers. That means they break their
[1:04:17] covenants.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; So you had in 1916 only 5% of births
[1:04:23] were out of wedlock.
[1:04:25] In 1996 it was over 32%.
[1:04:29] Today it's even climbed way higher than
[1:04:32] that. You see the the prevalence of
[1:04:35] homes without a father has even more
[1:04:38] than doubled since 1960.
[1:04:41] You you see God ordained marriage. He
[1:04:45] ordained a father to be in the home to
[1:04:48] to guide his family in righteousness.
[1:04:51] He ordained a mother to nurture her
[1:04:54] children in truth and and and and to
[1:04:57] raise children who are a testament to
[1:05:00] the presence of the living God in their
[1:05:02] home.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; You see, I I don't believe the gospel is
[1:05:06] something that we just talk about. I
[1:05:08] don't believe it's something that we
[1:05:10] just do at church. I tell you, it's got
[1:05:13] to be lived at home.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; And if they ain't lived at home, it's a
[1:05:17] worthless religion.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham warned over a half
[1:05:22] century ago of a of a powerful alien,
[1:05:27] this power, this powerful alien power
[1:05:30] that was taking over this nation. And it
[1:05:33] wasn't Russia. It wasn't communism. It
[1:05:36] wasn't from a a foreign land. It was
[1:05:38] from the pits of hell itself.
[1:05:41] And he called it the invasion of the
[1:05:43] United States. Go listen to it. It's a
[1:05:46] great sermon to hear. But but but these
[1:05:49] were not armies of men, but demonic
[1:05:52] forces that were infiltrating the
[1:05:55] schools, the colleges, the pulpits, the
[1:05:58] airwaves, the social media, and the
[1:06:01] home. And you know, Paul saw this too.
[1:06:04] He warned, "We wrestle not against flesh
[1:06:07] and blood,
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; but we are wrestling against
[1:06:10] principalities and powers and against
[1:06:13] rulers of darkness of this world."
[1:06:16] That's what we're wrestling against.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We send our kids to college, to a
[1:06:22] godless college, where they're
[1:06:24] brainwashed into this liberal thinking,
[1:06:27] and then we wonder what we did wrong.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; I tell you what you did wrong. Send them
[1:06:32] to college without the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:35] That's what you did wrong.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; We raised them to serve the Lord and
[1:06:39] then sent them over to a place where the
[1:06:41] devil has encamped and they get b
[1:06:43] brainwashed.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; And then the pediatricians, the doctors,
[1:06:48] they know it. That's why they they'll
[1:06:50] push the these vaccines on our our
[1:06:53] teenage boys and girls to prevent
[1:06:55] venerial disease because they know it's
[1:06:59] inevitable.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; They know it's going to happen.
[1:07:04] You see, but but they don't know the
[1:07:07] power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; They don't know what we know.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; That there is a blood that cleanses from
[1:07:15] sin and takes sin desire away.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; But you know what is all this building
[1:07:21] toward? It's building toward a
[1:07:23] coronation.
[1:07:25] This world is about to crown its king.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Not Christ, but Satan himself. the God
[1:07:33] of this world who will reign though it
[1:07:35] be briefly before the true king of kings
[1:07:38] descends in judgment but he'll reign for
[1:07:40] a while
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; you can read the book
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; you don't want to be here when Satan re
[1:07:46] reigns in full power
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; amen but I'll tell you what sadly even
[1:07:52] us who walk in the light of this message
[1:07:56] we're not untouched by the spirit of
[1:07:57] this age too too many places too many
[1:08:01] things. We We see it happen too often.
[1:08:04] Not just not just I'm not just speaking
[1:08:07] to here, but even around the world.
[1:08:10] Divorce, broken homes, rebellion, drugs
[1:08:14] plague our own ranks. And guess what? A
[1:08:18] new breed of preachers have risen in the
[1:08:20] message saying the Eternals prescription
[1:08:23] don't work.
[1:08:26] Well, I'll tell you this. It worked for
[1:08:28] me
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; and it works for everyone else who has
[1:08:32] taken it.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; But if it's not working, then there is
[1:08:37] two things. There's either two things.
[1:08:39] Either one, people are refusing it.
[1:08:42] You try to give it to them and they spit
[1:08:45] it out between your fingers.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Or else there's quack drugist
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; who have messed with the prescription,
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; deluded the gospel to where it's
[1:08:57] powerless.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah, the enemy has targeted our
[1:09:00] families.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; And I I don't mean to to point a bl a
[1:09:06] bleak picture, but I do want to tell you
[1:09:08] friends, it's time to go home. This
[1:09:10] ain't home.
[1:09:12] This is more and more feeling.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; It's an uncomfortable feeling.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; We don't belong here.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; We're an endangered species.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; And we
[1:09:28] we see the enemy
[1:09:30] targets our families cuz he knows that
[1:09:35] the home is the first church. It's the
[1:09:38] foundation of faith. Yet in the midst of
[1:09:41] this darkness, I still say there is a
[1:09:43] bride
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; who will not bow to bail.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; And but we must be watchful and we must
[1:09:50] we must be awake because the world we
[1:09:53] look around and see our our communities,
[1:09:56] our our cities, our nation, they're all
[1:09:59] dying. And the world is dying. Why?
[1:10:02] Because the last plague is passing
[1:10:04] through the land. Just as Revelation
[1:10:07] foretold him, I looked and behold a pale
[1:10:11] horse and his name that sat on him was
[1:10:13] death and hell followed him.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; That's the scripture.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, while death rides,
[1:10:27] life is rising.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where is it rising, brother Tim?
[1:10:33] In the hearts of the redeemed. The same
[1:10:36] spirit that raised up Christ from the
[1:10:38] dead still quickens his people. It makes
[1:10:41] you alive.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And darkness may cover the earth,
[1:10:46] but the glory of the Lord has risen upon
[1:10:48] you.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; What a difference that is.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; There it is. One of the many promises of
[1:10:56] the glory and power of God rising on the
[1:10:58] end time people
[1:11:00] while we have a world grouping in
[1:11:02] darkness. Now, brother Bradom told us in
[1:11:05] the message the Israel at Kadesh Barnea
[1:11:09] that God is is finishing when God was
[1:11:12] finished preparing Moses and had trained
[1:11:15] him for the task that that he began to
[1:11:18] send forth the signs you know and and
[1:11:20] finally he come to the last sign and the
[1:11:23] last sign that the prophet declared you
[1:11:25] remember Moses did it was death it was
[1:11:29] it was not physical death first but but
[1:11:32] it's spiritual death now that has struck
[1:11:34] the church. And then of course it's the
[1:11:37] final plague is a church that was once
[1:11:40] vibrant and full of life now dying and
[1:11:45] blowing away. And we're living in that
[1:11:47] dreadful hour. You know, old-timers who
[1:11:50] once shouted the victory are growing
[1:11:53] weary. The altars that once burned with
[1:11:56] a holy fire, you know, now they stand
[1:11:59] cold. The blood once boldly displayed on
[1:12:03] the doorpost is now being wiped away in
[1:12:06] the name of modern religion.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; But the gospel still stands. When I see
[1:12:12] the blood,
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; I'll pass over you.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; There is still the blood.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; There is still the token. There it is.
[1:12:20] The literal life of Jesus Christ that
[1:12:23] still atones.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know. We're in a world that's
[1:12:28] gone wrong. We are in a broken society.
[1:12:31] The church has not escaped its
[1:12:33] influence. And as ministers, we face
[1:12:36] battles we never imagined.
[1:12:40] I know I didn't imagine them when I
[1:12:42] started out. We've we face things,
[1:12:47] sin, compromise, broken homes,
[1:12:51] addiction, rebellion,
[1:12:53] it all trying to creep in.
[1:12:57] You know why?
[1:12:59] We're the last hold out.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; He's got all the others.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; So, he's got all his his guns trained on
[1:13:09] you.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But and and yet I I I want to tell
[1:13:13] you as I'm preaching today, I believe
[1:13:16] every problem in the home, every problem
[1:13:19] in the marriage, every problem in the
[1:13:21] church can all be healed by true baptism
[1:13:24] of the Holy Ghost. If we ever needed a
[1:13:27] dose of the Holy Ghost, a refilling of
[1:13:30] his spirit, an outpouring of his
[1:13:32] presence, it's now we need that.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I tell you, I know it can be
[1:13:38] healed. How do I know it worked for me?
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; It worked for my children.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. In fact, it's worked for everyone
[1:13:46] who has received it.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; And look around. I want you to see what
[1:13:52] God's doing. I want you to look around
[1:13:55] and think just for a moment. Look at the
[1:13:58] miracles of healing. Look at the
[1:14:00] miracles of salvation.
[1:14:03] Drug addiction vanquished. You see
[1:14:06] alcohol, alcoholism conquered. U you
[1:14:10] know, prodals returning, homes restored.
[1:14:14] You you know what it tells me? The
[1:14:15] eternal prescription works.
[1:14:21] But just like brother Brandham said in
[1:14:22] the message choosing of the bride and
[1:14:24] let me quote this one. Don't let the
[1:14:27] devil ever cool you off from this. Stay
[1:14:30] right with it until you're ever one
[1:14:32] filled with the Holy Ghost in so much
[1:14:34] that we make you come to this word
[1:14:36] that'll make you women straighten up,
[1:14:38] make you men straighten up. If you say
[1:14:40] you got the Holy Ghost and won't cope
[1:14:42] with the word, it's another spirit in
[1:14:44] you. God's spirit is on his word.
[1:14:46] Messianic, the anointed word. The bride
[1:14:49] must be the Messiah, the anointed word.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; And yet, as I said, we've got preachers
[1:14:55] trying to offer a new prescription
[1:14:58] other than that of of the book of Acts
[1:15:01] experience. They they claim Acts two
[1:15:03] won't won't work. So, they they offer
[1:15:06] kids an education to combat their
[1:15:10] problems with sexual sins and
[1:15:12] fornication. But brother Brandham warned
[1:15:14] us of this. Amen. We've got it in the
[1:15:17] message. It foretold in Broken Sisters
[1:15:20] 1965. And again, I quote, "Education can
[1:15:23] never bring life. It takes the spirit of
[1:15:26] God to bring life. And life must not
[1:15:29] come out of just an intellectual
[1:15:31] revival. It's got to come out of the
[1:15:33] Bible of word revival. And the word is
[1:15:36] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:15:38] And when it falls today and quickens,
[1:15:41] you get the same results you did in Acts
[1:15:44] two. Exactly. It always has and it
[1:15:47] always will be because it's the spirit
[1:15:49] of God that conditions the atmosphere.
[1:15:52] Yes sir.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you,
[1:15:57] I want to make you sure there's nothing
[1:16:00] wrong with that great experience,
[1:16:03] that wonderful filling of the spirit of
[1:16:05] God, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It
[1:16:08] still works.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; It still atones.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; It still saves. The problem is they've
[1:16:16] tried to water it down with education
[1:16:18] and and and psychology to try to modify
[1:16:22] behavior.
[1:16:23] Oh, let me tell you the eternal
[1:16:25] prescription. It has the power of
[1:16:27] change.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; That's what sets it apart. It don't just
[1:16:32] modify. It has the power to make you a
[1:16:35] new creation.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost, it burns
[1:16:39] out selfishness, burns out pride. It
[1:16:43] burns out bitterness. It restores love.
[1:16:45] It brings unity. It brings holiness.
[1:16:48] Amen. It gives men and women power to
[1:16:51] overcome, not just to survive.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said to him that
[1:16:56] overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me
[1:16:58] in my throne. You see, we are not called
[1:17:01] to be survivors here in Leodysia. We are
[1:17:04] called to be overcomers. Amen.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon saw that coming
[1:17:10] word, the revealed word of the hour that
[1:17:13] would produce a revival.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; But it wouldn't be a revival of tents
[1:17:18] and and crowds or citywide campaign.
[1:17:23] But he said it would take for this
[1:17:25] revival would take men and women called
[1:17:28] to God, a chosen generation.
[1:17:31] th those who would receive this word
[1:17:34] into their hearts and until that revival
[1:17:37] fire burned with him.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; That's what we want to see.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Tim, how can I get the
[1:17:43] revival fire in my life to burn higher?"
[1:17:46] I'll tell you, throw on more of the wood
[1:17:49] of the word of God.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how
[1:17:54] Amen. No, we've got to have a revival
[1:17:56] that burns within our hearts. That's the
[1:17:59] kind of revival we're talking about. Not
[1:18:01] one in Tennessee, not one in Louisiana,
[1:18:04] not one in Ohio or Virginia, but one
[1:18:06] that's burning in the hearts
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; of God's elect.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Like the Welsh Revival when the
[1:18:12] dignitaries came to find out about the
[1:18:15] move of God that was taking place. And
[1:18:17] they found an old humble policeman that
[1:18:19] was humming him on the on the corner.
[1:18:22] And and they asked him, "Where was the
[1:18:24] move of God?" And he said, "It's right
[1:18:25] here. Here's a revival.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; It's on the inside of me.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; And that's where the revival's got to
[1:18:32] be.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; You want revival in a church? Let me
[1:18:36] tell you, churches don't get revival.
[1:18:38] It's people that get revival. It's sons
[1:18:41] and daughters of God that get on fire
[1:18:43] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:47] Hallelujah. That's where the revival
[1:18:50] must be today is in the bride. And I
[1:18:53] want to just say, we're not waiting for
[1:18:55] another revival.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for another messenger.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for another message.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; We don't need a new breed of preachers
[1:19:04] in the message to give us something
[1:19:07] different. The bride's revival has
[1:19:09] already come. I could hear brother
[1:19:12] Bradam. I was there in 1965, Seport,
[1:19:15] Louisiana, and as a young boy, I heard
[1:19:17] him say it. The move is on for the
[1:19:19] bride. That's thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, God hadn't changed his
[1:19:25] mind.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; There is still a move on for the bride.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; The church may go backwards. The church
[1:19:31] may be backsliden. The world may go
[1:19:33] crazy, but there's a bride going
[1:19:35] forward. There's a people called by his
[1:19:38] name. There is a people who know their
[1:19:41] God and who will do exploits.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; We don't need something different. No.
[1:19:47] The rain, the former and the latter rain
[1:19:50] has already fallen. It fell together to
[1:19:53] bring a wheat bride to maturity. So let
[1:19:57] it be known. You know, there's nothing
[1:20:00] else coming. No new revelation,
[1:20:03] no new prophets.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; You see, you'll either receive this Holy
[1:20:08] Ghost or you'll perish.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; You'll either get the token or be left
[1:20:13] behind. Amen.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; The next great move. You want to know
[1:20:17] what it is, brother Tim? What do we
[1:20:19] expect? What is the next great move? The
[1:20:22] next great event on God's calendar is
[1:20:25] the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, we must do everything we
[1:20:30] can to pro to prepare for that coming.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; And if this word don't quicken you, if
[1:20:36] this Holy Ghost don't make you alive,
[1:20:39] then as a Gentile, there's no hope for
[1:20:41] you.
[1:20:43] There will not be another message to the
[1:20:45] gentile world. The door is closing. The
[1:20:48] times of the Gentiles are fulfilled
[1:20:51] already. The Bible said in second Peter
[1:20:53] 1:3, "His divine power hath given us all
[1:20:57] things that pertain to life and
[1:20:59] godliness. We have it. We have
[1:21:02] everything we need for the journey. The
[1:21:05] word is complete." Can I get an amen?
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. The spirit is present. Can
[1:21:11] somebody agree with that?
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? The bride is being made
[1:21:16] ready. And this is not the hour to look
[1:21:19] for something new. It's the hour to live
[1:21:21] out what's already been given.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; The same word that called the bride out
[1:21:27] will also call her up.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; But in 1958,
[1:21:32] the great revival, healing, revival was
[1:21:35] now about over. And brother Bradom
[1:21:38] looked forward with prophetic vision to
[1:21:41] the coming word, the great awakening
[1:21:44] that would rise in the bride of Jesus
[1:21:47] Christ. And he knew that this end time
[1:21:50] revival, it wouldn't be birthed by an
[1:21:53] may given way to another denomination
[1:21:57] or organized system like what we got at
[1:22:00] Jeffersonville now. Nor contained in
[1:22:03] church walls or committees. It would be
[1:22:07] something deposited in the hearts of men
[1:22:10] and women. It would be God called and
[1:22:13] God trained vessels, men and women who
[1:22:17] would carry the fire of that word and
[1:22:20] that would carry it to the ends of the
[1:22:22] earth. He would tell us in that sermon
[1:22:25] of God called man that we hear the cry
[1:22:28] of sincere hearts. And I mentioned this
[1:22:30] when I spoke on and I sought for a man
[1:22:33] just a couple of weeks ago. Anyway,
[1:22:35] there the call in many hearts for Lord
[1:22:38] send revival in our times and and truly
[1:22:41] that is still a cry that that that rises
[1:22:46] from the lips of believers today. It it
[1:22:48] moves the soul. It stirs the spirit. It
[1:22:50] quickens the heart because it's written
[1:22:52] and and actually I'm quoting from
[1:22:55] brother Brandham. He uses a scripture in
[1:22:57] 2 Chronicles 7:14. If my people which
[1:23:01] are called by my name
[1:23:05] shall humble themselves
[1:23:07] and pray and seek my face and turn from
[1:23:12] their wicked ways, then will I hear from
[1:23:14] heaven and will forgive their sins and
[1:23:17] heal their lands.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; You see that promise that promise is
[1:23:23] still alive today.
[1:23:25] But as brother Brandon revive reminded
[1:23:27] this week, God can't send a revival
[1:23:30] until he first has men prepared to bear
[1:23:33] it. And you you say, "Brother Tim, there
[1:23:36] ain't no revival." Let me tell you,
[1:23:38] there is a revival.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; It's the bride's revival.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And yet he can't send it to you
[1:23:48] until you're prepared to receive it.
[1:23:50] Amen.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Before the fire falls, there's got to be
[1:23:53] an altar built.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Before the outpouring, there has to be
[1:23:57] vessels that are prepared to contain it.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; You see, God needs men. God called men,
[1:24:04] God trained men, not men trained in
[1:24:08] seminaries or philosophies that are
[1:24:10] they're by polished by theology. Oh. Oh,
[1:24:14] man. You know, but what we need today is
[1:24:17] rugged men of faith. men who have met
[1:24:20] God, who have faced the fire, who knows
[1:24:23] that he's he's still alive, that he's
[1:24:25] the Almighty, to know he still heals and
[1:24:28] he still delivers. He still sets the
[1:24:31] captive free.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. As the psalm will say, some
[1:24:36] through the waters, and some through the
[1:24:38] floods, and some through the fire, but
[1:24:41] all through the blood. God purchases his
[1:24:44] children through testings. Oh my,
[1:24:46] haven't we all been through our share of
[1:24:48] testings, through deep valleys, through
[1:24:50] storms.
[1:24:52] Storms that sometimes seem to shake the
[1:24:54] very ground that's under our feet.
[1:24:57] Sometimes it takes years, but through it
[1:25:00] all, what has God doing? What has God
[1:25:03] been doing? He's been training an army
[1:25:06] for the front lines.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; And even now, God is raising up those
[1:25:11] very men and women. They, you know,
[1:25:13] there'll be warriors who who won't
[1:25:15] flinch in the heat of the battle, who
[1:25:18] will not quit when all seems lost. They
[1:25:21] are the Calebs. They are the Joshua of
[1:25:24] this generation whose hearts burn with a
[1:25:26] different spirit. They have seen the
[1:25:29] promise and they refuse to compromise.
[1:25:32] They refuse to turn back. They are the
[1:25:34] overcomers, the very ones that Jesus
[1:25:36] spoke of of this Leodysian age
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; to them that overcometh.
[1:25:42] And he said, "On this rock, I'll build
[1:25:45] my church and I'm going to have a people
[1:25:48] that the gates of hell will not prevail
[1:25:51] against."
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; How many can say, "I want to be in that
[1:25:55] group."
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you who they are. They're
[1:25:59] not weary survivors.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; They're warriors.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm calling today is
[1:26:05] warriors.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Warriors who who set their face toward
[1:26:08] the rapture.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just as Jesus set his face toward
[1:26:13] the cross, we should set our face.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach. We should set
[1:26:18] our face toward the resurrection.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; The Lord that great rapture.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; A people right in the midst of this
[1:26:26] leodysian chaos. Amen. A bride who is
[1:26:30] rising. A people who will defeat Satan
[1:26:33] right in his own Eden. Because this is
[1:26:37] Satan's Eden. But in his Eden there is a
[1:26:41] bride.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; She not like Eve back in that pure Eden.
[1:26:46] She's here in Satan's Eden. And she will
[1:26:49] not fall. She will not compromise. She
[1:26:53] will stand.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:03] Paul said in Philippians 3:13,
[1:27:07] "Forgetting those things which are
[1:27:10] behind and reaching forth,
[1:27:14] reaching forth unto those things which
[1:27:17] are before.
[1:27:19] I press toward the mark for the prize of
[1:27:22] the high calling." What is our high
[1:27:25] calling? What has been laid before us? A
[1:27:29] resurrection.
[1:27:30] where all the dead in Christ will come
[1:27:33] forth.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; What lays before us? The rapture. Come
[1:27:36] on, somebody.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where we caught up to meet the
[1:27:40] Lord in the air.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Do that was what lays before us. And as
[1:27:44] he said, I press toward the mark.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; So this is a generation that will break
[1:27:54] the cycle. They will face the gates of
[1:27:56] hell. They will overcome by the blood of
[1:27:59] the lamb. and the word of their
[1:28:01] testimony. I believe God has his men
[1:28:04] today.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; And I believe you are men and women that
[1:28:07] have been chosen.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; But there is a cycle.
[1:28:11] It's a it is a solemn sovereign cycle of
[1:28:14] revival and death that we were warned of
[1:28:17] as brother Brandham would began in that
[1:28:19] Ephesian church age tracing the pattern
[1:28:22] of generations through of Israel and and
[1:28:25] the history of the church. And he showed
[1:28:27] us how one age burns bright with the
[1:28:29] fire of God and with revival and zeal
[1:28:32] and purity and truth only for the next
[1:28:36] generation to let the flame flicker.
[1:28:41] He said in one generation is there
[1:28:43] revival in next it begins to fade. In
[1:28:46] the third it's only embers that remain.
[1:28:48] In the fourth not even a trace of the
[1:28:50] original flame can be found. Then God
[1:28:53] must light the fire again. Amen.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; And that's a tragic pattern
[1:28:59] of man's history with God. No matter
[1:29:02] what he called the manifestations of the
[1:29:05] truth.
[1:29:07] You You see, it's what it's what he
[1:29:10] called what brother Brandham described
[1:29:12] as a manifestation of the truth that God
[1:29:14] has no grandchildren.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Each generation has to be born again for
[1:29:22] itself.
[1:29:24] You see, you cannot inherit the Holy
[1:29:26] Ghost.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; You must experience him personally.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. As the Psalmist said, uh, you
[1:29:35] know, wilt thou not revive us again that
[1:29:38] thy people may rejoice in thee? You look
[1:29:41] back through the through the church ages
[1:29:44] behind us of Ephesus and Smyrna and
[1:29:46] Pergamus and Thyra and Sardis and
[1:29:49] Philadelphia and now Leodysia. And
[1:29:52] you'll see that same cycle repeated
[1:29:53] again and again.
[1:29:56] Each revival begins in power. It ends in
[1:29:59] formality.
[1:30:01] It dies in apathy. But there is one
[1:30:05] difference. And I want you to get this.
[1:30:08] Let this ring loud and clear to you. We
[1:30:12] have reached the end.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; There is no eighth age coming.
[1:30:20] Time has run out.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; The seventh church age is the final one.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; The messenger has sounded his message.
[1:30:28] The son of man has already revealed
[1:30:30] himself to his prophet and continues to
[1:30:33] do so through his bride.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; And the word has already been restored.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; And there is not another age
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; to carry the flame.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; It must be this one. Yeah.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you,
[1:30:50] let me remind you what he said to your
[1:30:53] age, Leoa. To him that overcometh. Let's
[1:30:56] put it up. Revelation 3:21. To him that
[1:30:59] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:31:02] in my throne, even as I also overcame,
[1:31:06] and have sat down with my father in his
[1:31:09] throne.
[1:31:13] You see, there has to be somebody that
[1:31:16] fulfills the scripture.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; I wonder when you see to him that
[1:31:21] overcometh, are you reading your name in
[1:31:23] it?
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know you're going to do it,
[1:31:27] brother T. Hey, that ain't going to help
[1:31:29] you. What about you?
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; I can't drag you along on my coattails.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; I can't pull you into heaven.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're going to have to see
[1:31:39] yourself in this scripture to him that
[1:31:41] overcometh.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. That may might mean getting dirty.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; That might mean getting getting smoke in
[1:31:50] your face and battling with scarred and
[1:31:53] wounded. I don't know what all it'll do.
[1:31:55] But I tell you this, you've got to make
[1:31:58] up your mind. I am fighting this battle
[1:32:00] to the end.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; And I will not come out of here a
[1:32:04] defeated individual. I'm going to come
[1:32:07] out of here more than a conqueror. I
[1:32:10] don't care what's in my family. I don't
[1:32:12] care what's in my past. I only know my
[1:32:15] future. And this is my future. My future
[1:32:19] is him that overcometh. Why will scrap
[1:32:22] to sit with me in the throne? The throne
[1:32:25] is my future.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Sin may have been your past. Failure may
[1:32:33] have been your past.
[1:32:35] Trouble may be in your past, but that's
[1:32:38] not your future.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; And you can't let your past define who
[1:32:42] you are.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; It is your future that defines who you
[1:32:46] are.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; There will be somebody who overcomes
[1:32:52] Leodysia.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; There will be a bride, the lamb's wife,
[1:32:57] who sits with him in the throne, who
[1:32:59] conquers the last deception, who breaks
[1:33:02] the cycle of revival and death. once and
[1:33:05] for all.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; This is a people in whom Christ will
[1:33:09] have the victory.
[1:33:11] A people in whom the word has
[1:33:13] preeminence
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; and in whom the spirit has full
[1:33:17] headship.
[1:33:19] They are the ones who will not just talk
[1:33:21] revival. Let me tell you, they will be
[1:33:24] the revival.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of people talking about it.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm tired of just preaching and
[1:33:32] and it never manifesting. I I I tell you
[1:33:34] it's time we be the revival.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Though the world decays, no churches
[1:33:39] fall asleep. This word cannot fail.
[1:33:41] God's promises cannot return to him
[1:33:44] void.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; This is the last word to the last church
[1:33:48] age, and somebody's going to fulfill it.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll have a bride, a church
[1:33:54] without spot or wrinkle or blemish or
[1:33:57] any such thing, and somebody's going to
[1:33:59] do it." Yes, sir. And Paul wrote, "To
[1:34:02] those that are alive and remain at the
[1:34:04] coming of the Lord,
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, shall be caught up together
[1:34:08] to meet the Lord in the air."
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; That means, you know what that means?
[1:34:13] That means there's a living people,
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; a people that's alive,
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; amen, in this final hour that are not
[1:34:20] overcome by sin, not subdued by
[1:34:23] darkness, but quickened by the very life
[1:34:26] of Christ himself. They are the
[1:34:28] overcomers who will not go the way of
[1:34:30] history. They will not die out and oh
[1:34:33] cold formal religion. They will keep
[1:34:35] alive the fire of Pentecost.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you for church, it's so
[1:34:40] important in this day and hour to really
[1:34:43] focus on why and what we have been
[1:34:45] called for in this hour.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Because there must be a people that
[1:34:50] break the cycle.
[1:34:53] Yes,
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; they're the ones who carry the torch
[1:34:59] not to pass it to another generation,
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; but all the way to the finish line.
[1:35:06] They're the embodiment of every prophecy
[1:35:09] that have been spoken about by bride of
[1:35:11] a bride. They're the living word made
[1:35:14] flesh.
[1:35:16] So, this is the bride's hour. But I want
[1:35:19] you to notice something. There's always
[1:35:22] two kinds of people in every age.
[1:35:26] And in this same Leodysian age, there
[1:35:28] are there are those who break the cycle
[1:35:30] of bride without spot or wrinkle,
[1:35:32] without blemish. And there are those who
[1:35:34] never do.
[1:35:37] One group rises in the power of his word
[1:35:39] and walks in victory and the other
[1:35:41] drifts into formality.
[1:35:43] Content with religion without fire.
[1:35:47] Creates that statements of faith without
[1:35:50] spirit. Profession without possession.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; And you and I both know.
[1:35:58] You and I both know this spotless
[1:36:01] condition
[1:36:02] where he said, "I'll have a bride
[1:36:04] without spot." We know that don't come
[1:36:06] from our own righteousness.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; No, it comes by grace alone.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; As he said, Ephesians 2:8-9, he said,
[1:36:14] "For by grace you're saved through
[1:36:16] faith, not of works, lest any man should
[1:36:18] boast."
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; So the bride stands pure, not because
[1:36:23] she's perfect
[1:36:25] in her own self, but because she's
[1:36:28] washed
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; in the blood of the lamb.
[1:36:33] Yeah, we got a whole multitude without
[1:36:35] number that is spoke of in the book of
[1:36:36] Revelation who goes to the tribulation
[1:36:40] who will face the judgments of God
[1:36:43] that are these judgments will be poured
[1:36:45] out on the earth as a time of God's
[1:36:47] wrath. God actually stored up the
[1:36:51] judgments of the past ages to pour out
[1:36:54] upon the Horish system, the harlot
[1:36:57] churches and and and the the the seed of
[1:37:02] the beast
[1:37:04] and and he stored them up and these
[1:37:06] vials will be poured out or they're
[1:37:08] spoken of vials in King James or bowls
[1:37:10] of judgment, but they're vessels stored
[1:37:12] up of judgment. God waiting until the
[1:37:17] bride is gone.
[1:37:18] to pour these things out.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; And you know why will he pour it out is
[1:37:24] why will they go through this rather you
[1:37:26] know because they though they were
[1:37:28] religious they never broke the cycle.
[1:37:31] They never went beyond tradition in the
[1:37:34] the fullness of the new birth. And
[1:37:37] brother Bradom told us this is a
[1:37:39] repeated process the rising and the
[1:37:42] fading of revival. And as I said, he he
[1:37:45] made it clear. It's a manifestation. God
[1:37:48] only has sons and daughters. God has no
[1:37:52] grandchildren.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; So salvation is not inherited.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; You know, it cannot be passed on
[1:37:59] intellectually.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Everyone must have their own experience.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and it has to be like John
[1:38:07] 1:13, which are born not of of not of
[1:38:11] blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor
[1:38:14] the will of man, but of God.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; That's why we got to have men and women
[1:38:19] born of God,
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; not of their own will, not of blood, not
[1:38:23] something they inherited.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; But you know, Brother Brandham told us
[1:38:29] you start out with two born again
[1:38:30] believers. Next generations comes,
[1:38:32] they're no longer plain believers,
[1:38:36] but now plain Christians. They take on a
[1:38:39] denominational name, a Baptist,
[1:38:41] Methodist, Pentecostal, and that's
[1:38:44] exactly what they become. Not
[1:38:46] Christians, but church members
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; until churches fulfill the scripture
[1:38:56] that they are caves of every unclean and
[1:38:59] hateful bird.
[1:39:02] unconverted people
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; fill in the pews
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; in the name of religion
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; mean
[1:39:12] contrary
[1:39:14] sick
[1:39:16] never overcoming
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; I don't want to pastor that kind of
[1:39:21] people
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; they ain't pastorable
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen I want to see pe men and women
[1:39:28] filled with the Holy Ghost the fire of
[1:39:30] God.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm not talking about
[1:39:33] something even 20 years ago. I'm talking
[1:39:35] about people with a fresh and upto-date
[1:39:38] experience.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; A people today who are alive and on fire
[1:39:42] and are burning.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; People who have zeal and passion. Now
[1:39:48] listen church. And as I preach this, you
[1:39:52] know, I I I just going to bring this
[1:39:55] little quotation down. And he says,
[1:39:57] "That fervent desire to please God, the
[1:39:59] passion to know his word, the hunger to
[1:40:02] walk in the spirit, it begins to fade
[1:40:04] and the church that was once on fire
[1:40:06] becomes cool and formal and
[1:40:10] respectable." Now listen,
[1:40:14] this is very special to me.
[1:40:17] What what I'm preaching today is is very
[1:40:20] special to me. And you'll know why.
[1:40:23] Because when I many years ago in the
[1:40:27] infancy of this church
[1:40:29] where I I preached from this very same
[1:40:33] text
[1:40:34] back in 1976, it was on April the 4th.
[1:40:39] We were there meeting in an old building
[1:40:42] that wouldn't hardly that wouldn't hold
[1:40:44] the the light or the window lights or
[1:40:46] the window panes.
[1:40:49] It was the wood had decayed around it.
[1:40:52] We were always had to replace it. Songs
[1:40:53] were written about us in old country
[1:40:55] church with broken window pains,
[1:40:59] you know, thing things like that. And
[1:41:00] and they was sung, you know, how they
[1:41:02] they saw Christ back in a manger in a
[1:41:05] cattle stall. The the church world
[1:41:08] didn't want him.
[1:41:10] And anyway, you know, in in that moment,
[1:41:13] on that day, it was April the 4th, 1976,
[1:41:18] preaching on this very same subject. The
[1:41:21] spirit of God moved. The altars were
[1:41:23] full, and that day that that many years
[1:41:27] ago now, my wife received the baptism of
[1:41:31] the Holy Ghost that changed her life
[1:41:33] forever. Brother Jerome who Buts who
[1:41:36] became one of the the first deacons, the
[1:41:39] first elected deacons in our church and
[1:41:41] and served for so faithful for so many
[1:41:43] years. He received the baptism of the
[1:41:46] Holy Ghost that very day. I would take
[1:41:49] him down to Old Tisley Pond and baptize
[1:41:51] him in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:41:53] Christ.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; And it's even more significant today.
[1:42:00] Today would have been Sister Karen's
[1:42:02] 67th birthday.
[1:42:07] But you know what? In heaven, there's no
[1:42:08] birthdays.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; So, I don't wish her a happy birthday.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; You only have birthdays here.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; When you're there, it's just one great
[1:42:18] big joy.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; We never grow old.
[1:42:24] And I realize standing right here at
[1:42:26] this very same place on this scripture,
[1:42:29] loved ones that are there,
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; loved ones that made it over
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; were the result of this kind of
[1:42:36] preaching.
[1:42:38] [Applause]
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; But you see, this was the problem with
[1:42:48] Ephesus. They began with power. They
[1:42:50] ended with formality. Their first love
[1:42:53] was dying. But God's word still cries
[1:42:56] out. 2 Corinthians 6:17. Come out from
[1:42:59] among them and be separate, sayith the
[1:43:02] Lord. Touch not the unclean thing and I
[1:43:04] will receive you. You see, it's not the
[1:43:07] hour then to cool off or to blend in.
[1:43:09] It's the hour to stand out.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; To be a called out chosen people, a
[1:43:14] royal priesthood, a holy nation, a
[1:43:16] peculiar people.
[1:43:18] I tell you what, you need to let the
[1:43:20] world know who you are.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the fire that once burned at
[1:43:25] Pentecost burn in you again. Let this
[1:43:27] bride be different, not just in
[1:43:30] doctrine, but in fire, in holiness, in a
[1:43:32] passionate love for the word of God. For
[1:43:35] you are called to a high calling.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Put back Revelation 3:21 again.
[1:43:45] I just want to hold this.
[1:43:47] Somebody's going to sit with him on the
[1:43:49] throne.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you while you're looking
[1:43:53] at that scripture.
[1:43:55] There is no higher calling.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; On this earth,
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; no higher calling
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; than to be the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:44:07] It is the greatest privilege ever
[1:44:09] offered to mortal man to be chosen,
[1:44:13] redeemed, united with the eternal
[1:44:15] bridegroom himself.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; This calling, let me tell you, it is
[1:44:19] higher. It is higher than the calling of
[1:44:22] a prophet.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; It is higher than the calling of a
[1:44:25] priest, higher than the sacred office of
[1:44:28] a pastor or teacher, apostle, or name
[1:44:31] any of them.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; For the bride is not merely a servant.
[1:44:34] She's the wife of the lamb.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; She shares his name. Hallelujah. She
[1:44:40] shares his nature. Amen. She shares his
[1:44:44] throne and therefore she shares his
[1:44:47] glory.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; So if you ever been called by that holy
[1:44:53] call and then walk worthy of it.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm asking.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:1, walk worthy of the
[1:45:01] vocation wherewith you are called.
[1:45:04] You're not called to be an ordinary
[1:45:06] believer.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; I want you to get it.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; You're not an ordinary believer.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; You're not just an ordinary
[1:45:16] denominational
[1:45:18] benchwarmer.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; That's not what you've been called to.
[1:45:22] You have been handpicked
[1:45:24] by grace
[1:45:27] in the to stand
[1:45:30] in the most intimate relationship
[1:45:32] possible
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; with the Lord of glory.
[1:45:39] You wear his name. You have his life.
[1:45:43] You carry his word. You bear his image.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Think of it. He's the bridegroom. You're
[1:45:49] the bride.
[1:45:51] There is no higher honor on earth than
[1:45:53] to be bone of his bone
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; and flesh of his flesh.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; You got a sacred responsibility.
[1:46:01] Amen. You got a responsibility to live
[1:46:03] worthy of that name to reflect his
[1:46:06] holiness, his purity, his love, his
[1:46:08] truth. Yeah, it's a dark hour, but you
[1:46:11] must be the light in it.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; You must mirror as the bride. You must
[1:46:16] mirror the groom. What a privilege that
[1:46:18] is. But now as we as we look at this
[1:46:22] this morning, I I want to hurry on
[1:46:25] because I want to I want to get some to
[1:46:29] some things
[1:46:31] today is because I want you to
[1:46:33] understand that no matter where you are,
[1:46:36] you may be cold and different,
[1:46:37] backsliding, I don't know. You may be
[1:46:40] one of those on fire for God. You may
[1:46:41] just need a little more of the wood put
[1:46:43] on your fire. Burn it a little higher. I
[1:46:46] don't know where you are, but let me
[1:46:49] just say, what is the way back?
[1:46:53] How do we break the cycle of revival and
[1:46:56] death?
[1:46:58] This answer, it's as old as it is
[1:47:01] powerful.
[1:47:03] The way back is the way of repentance.
[1:47:07] Did you know that in the Leodysian age,
[1:47:10] our age, his direct message to you was
[1:47:14] to be zealous to repent?
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; If you would have a seal to have a seal,
[1:47:21] to repent
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; every time you face the word of God, you
[1:47:24] repent.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; And you don't look to change it. You
[1:47:28] don't look for compromise. You don't
[1:47:30] look for an easy way out. You just
[1:47:31] repent.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; You just say, "God, you're right. I'm
[1:47:35] wrong.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm ready to change.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; I'm re, you know, if you're telling me I
[1:47:42] need more of the Holy Ghost than Lord,
[1:47:44] put out, let me put out everything that
[1:47:46] keeps me from it. Let me get more of the
[1:47:48] Holy Ghost.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Whatever you say, God,
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; I don't want a self assessment of myself
[1:47:55] like Leodia does. I don't need it.
[1:47:59] But I want to be constantly looking,
[1:48:01] examining
[1:48:03] my life.
[1:48:06] Where could I button up a little?
[1:48:09] How could I please him more?
[1:48:14] You know, some of you say, "Well, I I
[1:48:16] don't understand, Brother Tim. I don't
[1:48:18] understand. I I You know, sometimes
[1:48:20] people say, "Well, I I don't understand
[1:48:21] this about not wearing makeup, and I
[1:48:24] don't understand about not cutting our
[1:48:26] hair. I don't understand why we can't
[1:48:30] cross-dress and and wear men's clothes.
[1:48:32] I don't understand why. I don't
[1:48:35] understand. I don't It ain't about
[1:48:37] understanding.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; You're expecting it to be reasonable
[1:48:48] according to today's standards of
[1:48:51] society
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; and you'll never understand it. That's
[1:48:56] right.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, then what's the
[1:49:00] solution, brother Tim?" Love.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; If I get you to do one thing, go, you
[1:49:06] know, when he when he said to Israel,
[1:49:08] Israel said, "Tell us what to do. We'll
[1:49:10] do it."
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; God didn't want a law. He wanted love.
[1:49:14] Yeah.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "If a man, if you will love me
[1:49:17] with all your heart, with all your soul,
[1:49:19] with all your being,
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; and when you love God so much,
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; you don't care whether you understand it
[1:49:27] or not,
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; you just know that don't please him and
[1:49:30] you want to please him
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; because he said, "If you love me, keep
[1:49:40] my commandments.
[1:49:43] Yes.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't understand. It ain't about
[1:49:47] understanding.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; It's about love.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; You know, you got a husband and he don't
[1:49:56] like lemon pie.
[1:49:59] You don't force it to him to have it on
[1:50:01] his birthday cuz he don't like it.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; If he don't like it, you don't serve it
[1:50:10] to him.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. Well, I don't understand.
[1:50:13] I love it. Well, it has nothing to do
[1:50:15] with how you love. It's him. Don't like
[1:50:19] lemon pie.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; And then that's me. I don't like lemon
[1:50:25] pie.
[1:50:28] My wife loved it.
[1:50:30] She can make it for herself anytime she
[1:50:32] wanted, but I didn't. Don't serve it to
[1:50:33] me.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; You know, don't give it to me for my
[1:50:38] birthday.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; It's not going to make me happy.
[1:50:43] You know, and when we're talking about
[1:50:44] the bridegroom and we read in his word,
[1:50:47] don't come to him dressed and acting and
[1:50:50] doing things that, you know, offends
[1:50:52] him.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; If he said it's an abomination for a man
[1:50:56] to wear a woman to wear man's garments
[1:51:00] or God hates it,
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; well, I don't think this loving father
[1:51:04] this God said I hate it.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well, why does he die?"
[1:51:10] And you know, it don't even matter.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; It don't even matter.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; And when you get in love,
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; it won't matter to you either.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; You won't care. You won't care whether
[1:51:23] he wants his edge fried or scrambled.
[1:51:25] You won't care. You just want to please
[1:51:27] him. You want to make this marriage
[1:51:28] work. You want to make heaven your home.
[1:51:30] Come on, somebody help me preach. Amen.
[1:51:33] You get so in love with him, you don't
[1:51:35] want to grieve his Holy Spirit one time.
[1:51:37] I don't want to do one thing that would
[1:51:39] offend him.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; But the way is the way of repentance.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; It's not an emotion, intellect,
[1:51:53] nor not in reformation. It's in a broken
[1:51:56] heart, a contrite spirit.
[1:51:58] Here, listen. Psalms 51:17.
[1:52:03] The sacrifices of God are a broken
[1:52:06] spirit and a broken and contrite heart.
[1:52:11] Oh God, thou wilt not despise.
[1:52:16] You see, repentance, it brings us back
[1:52:19] to our first love.
[1:52:21] It it breaks the It breaks that pattern
[1:52:23] of decline. It restores the fire that
[1:52:26] once burned in the upper room. if we'll
[1:52:28] humble our hearts
[1:52:30] and and remember and return the the
[1:52:33] cycle will be broken. Life will flow
[1:52:35] again.
[1:52:37] So now think about this. If a sinner has
[1:52:41] to come to God by the way of repentance
[1:52:43] and they must,
[1:52:45] then how much more the lukewarm, the
[1:52:48] backslider, the complacent believer
[1:52:51] repent. The the sinner comes from
[1:52:53] darkness to light, but the backslider
[1:52:55] turns away from light into darkness and
[1:52:58] they got to repent.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; And his repentance must cut deeper.
[1:53:03] When a backslider comes back, he's got
[1:53:05] to even have a it must even cut deeper.
[1:53:08] It's got to go deeper than what it was
[1:53:10] in the in the first time
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; that it roots out sin.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; So it must it must cut deeper. Is
[1:53:19] somebody with me?
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist cried in Matthew 3 and8
[1:53:23] bring forth fruit meat for repentance.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; What was he saying? Prove it by your
[1:53:28] life.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Don't just confess it with your lips
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; and you don't confirm it by your walk.
[1:53:36] Amen. True repentance is not tears, it's
[1:53:39] turning.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; You You see, it's not emotion, it's
[1:53:43] transformation.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; You see, God born say, "If you don't
[1:53:47] repent, I'll remove your candlestick."
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; In other words, in other words, I'll
[1:53:52] take the light away from you. I I'll
[1:53:55] remove your faithful messengers, your
[1:53:57] faithful shepherds. I'll leave you to
[1:53:59] yourself. And that's a dreadful thing to
[1:54:01] be left to yourself. to have religion
[1:54:03] without re revelation, to have form
[1:54:05] without fire, to have words without
[1:54:07] witness.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Yet you can still talk about
[1:54:12] Christianity and sing about and preach
[1:54:14] about it, but be bereft of it.
[1:54:17] It'll be kabad
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; written over the door. The glory has
[1:54:21] departed.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Now look, that happened to Ephesians,
[1:54:28] the the city of Ephesus. Its symbols of
[1:54:31] beauty and wealth are now nothing but
[1:54:33] stones and overgrown ruins.
[1:54:37] The harbor that once welcomed ships now
[1:54:39] is a marsh. Population dwindled to a
[1:54:43] handful of unbelievers
[1:54:46] living among the relics of what was of
[1:54:48] what was once was.
[1:54:52] But let me tell you, she could have
[1:54:54] repented.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; You know, God would have restored her.
[1:54:59] God would have God would have restored,
[1:55:01] but she had to humble herself.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; And it and this doesn't mean that we
[1:55:06] can't repent. We can, but it must be
[1:55:08] quickly. As Hebrews 3:15 said, "Today,
[1:55:12] if you will hear his voice,
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; if you'll harden not your heart," you
[1:55:17] see, it's got to be a true heart cry to
[1:55:19] God. Not not a ritual, not a formality,
[1:55:22] but a cry that is that is born out of
[1:55:25] sorrow, a longing for restoration.
[1:55:28] And if you do that, God will answer from
[1:55:30] heaven. He'll restore what is lost. The
[1:55:32] glory will return. It's repentance that
[1:55:35] breaks the cycle.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; But you see, sin has got to be dealt
[1:55:39] with. I'm going I'm going to hurry up,
[1:55:43] but I'm still going to take my time.
[1:55:45] Now, that's a paradox,
[1:55:50] but I just want to say sin must be dealt
[1:55:54] with,
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; not covered up.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; It must be exposed,
[1:56:02] confronted, and cut off.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Well, you cannot make peace with sin.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; You can't play with the flesh. Let me
[1:56:13] tell you, sin is deadly.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; It's not a pet. It's a predator.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; It's like a wild animal that will
[1:56:20] destroy you if you ever dare to feed it.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Years ago years ago, I was up in
[1:56:26] Bamp up in Canada. I took a little trip
[1:56:29] and I preached a meeting there with
[1:56:31] brother Hilderbrandt in in his church.
[1:56:33] My wife and I went up there with him and
[1:56:36] we went up into the mountains afterwards
[1:56:38] there into B and Jasper. If you've ever
[1:56:40] been there, it's beautiful.
[1:56:42] It's a little place of heaven. They took
[1:56:44] my my wife and me sightseeing through
[1:56:47] those beautiful mountains. I kept seeing
[1:56:50] these signs and along the road and I'm a
[1:56:52] sign reader, you know. I I'll read them
[1:56:54] right out loud, you know, and I have to
[1:56:57] be careful cuz some of them ain't worth
[1:56:59] reading, but I it's kind of habit of
[1:57:02] mine. I'll look at that sign and I'll
[1:57:04] read it right out loud. And the signs
[1:57:08] were saying, "Don't feed the animals.
[1:57:12] a $1,000 fine.
[1:57:17] Well,
[1:57:19] I read every one of them. I'd see it
[1:57:21] again. Don't feed the animals. $1,000
[1:57:25] fine. Well, Brother Hilden Brandt
[1:57:29] finally said, "Hey, you know what that
[1:57:31] that's about? You know why those signs
[1:57:33] are posted?" I said, "No." Well, because
[1:57:36] the tourists
[1:57:38] forgot the bears were wild.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; And he told me that people would see
[1:57:44] cute bears and and think they were tame,
[1:57:47] you know, just big furry friends. and
[1:57:50] and sister Marlene, you know, said,
[1:57:52] "Yeah, I've even got pictures of photos
[1:57:54] of of um said, Harold, run out and snap
[1:57:58] the picture where I was feeding a big
[1:58:01] big mammoth bear through a little crack
[1:58:03] in my window." I just rolled it down
[1:58:06] just enough to slip a cracker or
[1:58:07] something out.
[1:58:10] Now, you know, I'm Louisiana redneck, I
[1:58:14] guess. So, I thought, "How dumb is
[1:58:16] that?"
[1:58:18] I mean a little tiny piece of glass
[1:58:20] between you and a wild animal there feet
[1:58:22] in there and it open about an inch rem
[1:58:25] and separated by just this thin piece of
[1:58:28] glass. That's pretty stupid.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; But you know one man he got so carried
[1:58:33] away he put honey on his little
[1:58:35] daughter's hand
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; so that the bear could come would come
[1:58:39] up and lick it off. But the bear mot
[1:58:42] wanted more than the honey.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; It took the child and mauled it. After
[1:58:46] that, laws were passed. Don't feed the
[1:58:49] animals.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Now, friends, what's this about? Your
[1:58:53] flesh is just like that. It's an animal.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; It is wild.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, not mine, brother Tim. It's born
[1:59:01] again. No, it ain't.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; It's not converted
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; and it never will be.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Ah, you can't tame it
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; and you can't trust it. Amen.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; You can't make peace with it.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; You can only keep it under the word and
[1:59:20] under the Holy Ghost. That's all you can
[1:59:22] do.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; You got to Oh, come on now.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to have the Holy
[1:59:27] Ghost on the inside, the throne of your
[1:59:30] heart.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; And you're going to have to be like Adam
[1:59:32] who ruled the wild beast in Eden.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. The lion had its nature. Lamb had
[1:59:39] its nature. And when the lamb, the lion
[1:59:41] rose up to take the lamb, Adam, the god
[1:59:44] of the earth, sit down, boy.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; You see, he kept the peace.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; He kept the harmony. And it made an Eden
[1:59:56] around him. Now, if you want heaven
[1:59:58] around you,
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; come on, you got to realize that your
[2:00:03] flesh is just an animal. Is not
[2:00:05] converted. You can't make peace with it.
[2:00:07] You've got to keep it under the word and
[2:00:09] the Holy Ghost. Amen. There's got to be
[2:00:12] the Holy Spirit sitting on the throne of
[2:00:14] your heart.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Come on. Bringing a millennium of peace
[2:00:18] in your heart. I'm not trying to put you
[2:00:20] in the millennium now, but I'm talking
[2:00:22] about a rain of peace in your heart.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what then? Bringing subduing
[2:00:28] the earth around you.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's what God told Adam to
[2:00:33] do. I'm going to give you this and you
[2:00:36] reign here and you reign and and you
[2:00:39] subdue everything around you until the
[2:00:43] whole earth would be in Eden.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Now that's what God wants for you.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; He puts he puts Christ on the throne of
[2:00:54] your heart. Gives you the power to put
[2:00:57] an Eden around you.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Now hold that. Now, let me just show you
[2:01:02] in 1 Corinthians 9:27. Here's the
[2:01:04] Apostle Paul, sanctified, Holy Ghost fil
[2:01:07] man. I keep my body, I keep under my
[2:01:11] body and bring it into subjection.
[2:01:15] What
[2:01:17] Paul said, I keep my body and bring it
[2:01:20] into subjection.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; In other words, don't feed the animal.
[2:01:25] You see, don't feed it with lust, pride,
[2:01:29] bitterness, jealousy, anger, self-will.
[2:01:33] Because if you feed it, it'll rise up.
[2:01:35] It'll destroy you. It'll destroy your
[2:01:37] home. It'll destroy your marriage. It'll
[2:01:39] destroy your ministry. It'll destroy
[2:01:41] your walk with God.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Sin will always take you further than
[2:01:46] you want to go.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; It'll keep you longer than you wanted to
[2:01:49] stay.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; And it'll cost you far more than you
[2:01:52] ever intended to pay.
[2:01:56] Because sin pays its wages.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; The wages of sin is death.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; And that's why God sent set boundaries.
[2:02:06] And those boundaries are not to restrict
[2:02:09] your joy,
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; but to protect your life.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; The the word of God with the power of
[2:02:17] the Holy Ghost, it's like a fence that
[2:02:19] that keeps the beast behind the bars.
[2:02:23] You see, that's why holiness is
[2:02:25] preached. Listen, people get the wrong
[2:02:27] idea about holiness. They they think
[2:02:29] it's man's control.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Like like some poor little woman come to
[2:02:34] church and she come around and you know
[2:02:37] she she she learned we were the ladies
[2:02:40] wore dresses church so she changed her
[2:02:42] dress. She started wearing dress to
[2:02:43] church. Then then we had a work day and
[2:02:46] she said her husband said, "Well, we're
[2:02:48] going to go help them at evening light.
[2:02:50] You don't do a little work day today.
[2:02:51] I'm sure the women will be in their
[2:02:53] pants, which they went and they was all
[2:02:55] in their skirts. So, she went to some of
[2:02:58] them and said, "Listen, Brother Tim
[2:03:00] seems to be reasonable. He seems to be a
[2:03:02] very kind man.
[2:03:04] And I think if we would all talk to him,
[2:03:08] he would let us wear pants and cut our
[2:03:11] hair.
[2:03:12] You know, he let us He's He's
[2:03:16] reasonable.
[2:03:18] Well, you know,
[2:03:20] it's like this. I didn't make the rules
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; and I can't change them.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; If God says something in his word, I
[2:03:31] can't go back on it.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Is somebody with me?
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the but that's why holiness
[2:03:40] preach. It's not man's control or rules.
[2:03:43] It's God's mercy. Amen.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Listen, we we teach things. We teach you
[2:03:49] young people not to kiss and hug and all
[2:03:52] of that and have in intimacy before
[2:03:54] marriage. Why do we do that? You say,
[2:03:58] "Well, you're restricting us." No, we
[2:04:00] are holding back sin.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; We know the flesh is weak.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm Holy Ghost fil, but I'm not
[2:04:11] going to meet with you sisters in my
[2:04:12] office
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; by yourself. Amen.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know better than to do that. I
[2:04:17] mean, hey, you know, even if I would
[2:04:19] behave, and I believe I would, I believe
[2:04:21] the Holy Ghost would keep me,
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; but let me tell you, I'm not going to
[2:04:24] bring a shame on his name. I don't want
[2:04:26] no question on him.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; That's the same way you should be.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Some of the ladies send me a text and
[2:04:37] you know, I'll include my son on it and
[2:04:39] they answer, "Why? I'm protecting him.
[2:04:44] I'm protecting
[2:04:46] his name.
[2:04:49] I don't want to bring reproach.
[2:04:52] So you see the Bible said in Galatians
[2:04:55] 5:16, "Walk in the spirit and you'll not
[2:04:58] walk fulfill the law of the flesh or the
[2:05:00] lust of the flesh." So the danger is not
[2:05:03] outside, it's inside. The unbridled
[2:05:05] flesh is the greatest enemy you'll ever
[2:05:08] face.
[2:05:10] and and and and that's what Paul said
[2:05:12] that they that are Christ and Galatians
[2:05:14] 5:24, they that are Christ have
[2:05:16] crucified the flesh with the affections
[2:05:18] and lust. So you got to keep those
[2:05:21] animals behind the bars, the bars of the
[2:05:23] word, the the the cage of obedience, the
[2:05:25] restraint of the Holy Ghost. You don't
[2:05:28] feed it. You don't play with it. You
[2:05:29] don't excuse it. Do one thing. Crucify
[2:05:32] it.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Keep it dead.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Let the word keep it bound. Let the
[2:05:38] spirit of God rule
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Now, that's not bondage. That's freedom.
[2:05:43] That's not legalism. That's life.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, people say, "I, brother Tim, you're
[2:05:49] the most legalistic preacher I ever saw
[2:05:52] or heard of." I'll tell you what, I'm
[2:05:54] not
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; legalist. I didn't legalize sin.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; The devil did.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; So, I'm not the legalist.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you what the word of
[2:06:06] God said. Amen.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; You see, you know, and and let me carry
[2:06:11] this further. We got a little time.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; You when you were born again, when you
[2:06:17] were filled with the Holy Ghost, did
[2:06:19] that take every natural passion of the
[2:06:21] flesh away from you?
[2:06:25] No. Of course not.
[2:06:27] If it did, there would never be a godly
[2:06:29] husband and a wife bring forth children
[2:06:32] in this world. The new birth doesn't
[2:06:34] remove human desire.
[2:06:37] It redeems it and brings it under divine
[2:06:40] control.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; You You see Hebrews 13:4 said, "Marriage
[2:06:45] is honorable and all and the bed
[2:06:47] undevoured, but mongers and
[2:06:49] adulterers God will judge."
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; You see, the Holy Ghost doesn't it
[2:06:55] doesn't erase your emotions. It
[2:06:57] sanctifies them. It don't kill desire.
[2:07:00] It channels it into God's ordained
[2:07:04] boundaries.
[2:07:05] You you see passion becomes purity then
[2:07:09] and love then becomes loyalty and intim
[2:07:12] intimacy becomes holy when it abides in
[2:07:15] the word and that's what grace does.
[2:07:18] Grace teaches us how to live disciplined
[2:07:22] holy spirit-led lives. That's what grace
[2:07:25] does. Oh, I know there are men who want
[2:07:27] to turn grace into lasciviousness. But
[2:07:30] Titus 2:1 said, "For the grace of God
[2:07:34] that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
[2:07:36] all men, teaching us that denying
[2:07:38] ungodliness and worldly lust, we should
[2:07:41] live soberly and righteously and godly
[2:07:44] in this present world."
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; You see, but sin's got to be dealt with.
[2:07:49] The works of the flesh, lust, pride,
[2:07:51] rebellion, anger, jealousy, envy, it all
[2:07:55] must be crucified and not coddled.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're not and they, let me get
[2:08:01] this, they are not managed by willpower.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; They are not managed through lessons and
[2:08:09] sessions of behavioral modification.
[2:08:12] They are conquered through repentance
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; and by the power of the Holy Ghost.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Somebody be with me now. The Bible said
[2:08:22] Galatians 5:25, "If we live in the
[2:08:24] spirit, let us walk in the spirit." So
[2:08:27] if we are the power of the Holy Ghost in
[2:08:30] us, we can live in the spirit and walk
[2:08:32] in the spirit.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; That's where there is no condemnation.
[2:08:37] when we walk not after the flesh but
[2:08:39] after the spirit.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; You see Galatians 5:24 said, "They that
[2:08:44] are Christ have crucified the flesh with
[2:08:48] the affections and lust." So yeah, when
[2:08:51] you were born again, God didn't remove
[2:08:53] your humanity. He gave you the spirit to
[2:08:57] rule it.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; He didn't take away passion. He gave you
[2:09:02] purpose.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; He didn't erase your emotions. He gave
[2:09:06] you power to govern them.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; And that's what the Holy Ghost does. It
[2:09:10] it takes what once ruled you and it puts
[2:09:13] it under the dominion of Christ.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; And the only way to keep it that way is
[2:09:18] the same way we started. Repentance.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why Paul said, "I die
[2:09:23] daily."
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; You see, that's the first dose of the
[2:09:27] eternal prescription. Repent.
[2:09:31] And and you see, as I said, sin and
[2:09:34] pride, the flesh, it must be dealt daily
[2:09:37] with at the altar until the only life
[2:09:40] that remains is Christ in you, the hope
[2:09:43] of glory.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; And that repentance
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; must be genuine.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Get it now? Because this is an age of
[2:09:54] shallow emotion,
[2:09:56] quick fixes
[2:09:58] where everything is just superficial.
[2:10:02] I know what I'm talking about.
[2:10:04] Let me tell you that true repentance,
[2:10:07] the kind that comes from a broken and a
[2:10:09] contrite heart, a total surrender of
[2:10:12] will and desire,
[2:10:14] that has now been watered down.
[2:10:18] It's watered down to nothing more than,
[2:10:20] "Oh, we just turn over a new leaf. We'll
[2:10:22] just join a church. We make a
[2:10:24] resolution.
[2:10:26] We attend special meetings. We'll kneel
[2:10:28] a few minutes at the altar."
[2:10:31] But let me tell you, that won't help
[2:10:33] you.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; It won't last. And you can make every
[2:10:38] promise under heaven.
[2:10:40] You can go to promisekeepers.
[2:10:43] You can sign cards. You can stand before
[2:10:46] other men and pledge, I'll do better.
[2:10:48] But unless your nature has changed,
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; you'll go right back to doing the same
[2:10:53] old things again. The same thing you
[2:10:56] always done. Why? Cuz there's no king
[2:10:59] called Christ on your throne to say,
[2:11:01] "Down, boy."
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; When your flesh rises up,
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; you see, a man's got to be born again.
[2:11:09] He'll never understand the kingdom of
[2:11:11] God. Amen.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; So, you want to understand, we'll get
[2:11:15] born again.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Then understanding comes,
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; but you'll read self-help books. You'll
[2:11:22] learn positive philosophies.
[2:11:25] You'll even sit under good teaching like
[2:11:28] we have at this church. But if if sin
[2:11:31] nature is not dealt with and crucified,
[2:11:34] all the training of the world will not
[2:11:36] change your life.
[2:11:38] The Romans 8:13 said, "If you live after
[2:11:41] the flesh, ye shall die. But if you
[2:11:44] through the spirit do mortify, that
[2:11:46] means kill, kill dead, the disease of
[2:11:50] the body, you shall live.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; You see what you got to do.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; But everything is superficial."
[2:11:58] Ah, turn a new leaf instead of become a
[2:12:01] new creature.
[2:12:03] The Bible said in 2 Corinthians 5:17,
[2:12:05] "If any man be in Christ, he is a new
[2:12:09] creature.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away and behold,
[2:12:13] all things become new."
[2:12:15] But
[2:12:17] you know, we change that with modern
[2:12:19] religion until we have countless
[2:12:21] impersonations
[2:12:23] of the new birth. Come shake a hand with
[2:12:25] the preacher, kneel at the altar,
[2:12:26] minute, go confess, get baptized, you
[2:12:29] know, all these stuff. And people claim
[2:12:31] to be born again and have never yet
[2:12:34] experienced the death of the old man.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; Well, to be born again means you have to
[2:12:43] die.
[2:12:48] To be resurrected to new life means the
[2:12:51] old life died.
[2:12:55] And so the sacred experience of the
[2:12:57] cleansing of the soul, the forgiveness
[2:12:58] of sins, it's just been reduced to
[2:13:00] church joining. Oh, we just come join
[2:13:02] your church, Brother Tim. It won't help
[2:13:04] you. You'll go to hell like everybody
[2:13:06] else.
[2:13:11] I'm just making a profession of faith.
[2:13:13] Well, I believe the message.
[2:13:16] But belief without the new birth is
[2:13:18] still unbelief.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; That's what people don't get.
[2:13:23] Belief without the new birth is still
[2:13:24] unbelief.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; And the baptism of the Holy Ghost has
[2:13:28] been downgraded to mere emotionalism or
[2:13:31] either that just a shallow confession.
[2:13:35] But let me tell you, it's not
[2:13:37] excitement.
[2:13:39] It's not enthusiasm. And it's not an
[2:13:41] intellectual conception.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a mental ascent that it's
[2:13:46] the truth. It's deity. That's what it
[2:13:48] is. It's deity. It's God himself to come
[2:13:51] and live and dwell on the inside of that
[2:13:54] man or woman.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; It's Christ in you.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; You see, that's the true baptism of the
[2:14:00] Holy Ghost. When Christ takes over, but
[2:14:03] repentance, now listen to me. Repentance
[2:14:06] is not saying, "I'm sorry."
[2:14:10] That's a good start,
[2:14:15] but I got something to say to you. And
[2:14:17] you say, "I'm sorry." I say, "You're
[2:14:20] right. You are sorry. Now repent."
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Ah, brother Tim.
[2:14:32] You see what happens is often I'm sorry
[2:14:35] means I'm sorry I got caught
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; or or or maybe I'm sorry because of the
[2:14:44] pain that I'm experienced because of my
[2:14:47] wrongdoings
[2:14:49] but never turning from the wrong.
[2:14:54] You see let me tell let me show you a
[2:14:56] scripture. 2 Corinthians 17:10, "Godly
[2:15:00] sorrow brings repentance that leads to
[2:15:03] salvation
[2:15:05] and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow
[2:15:08] brings death." You can just keep that up
[2:15:09] for a minute.
[2:15:11] So true repentance is what? Godly
[2:15:14] sorrow.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see, that's what it is.
[2:15:20] It's when your heart breaks.
[2:15:23] That's good.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Not because I lost my wife and I lost my
[2:15:27] kids and I lost this and I lost my money
[2:15:30] and I lost, you know, and I'm so dead
[2:15:31] drunk and I'm just And you're just sorry
[2:15:34] about the condition that sin brought you
[2:15:36] into, but you're not sorry of the sin.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:42] Repentance is when your heart breaks
[2:15:47] because you know you grieve the Holy
[2:15:50] Ghost.
[2:15:57] When you fall before God in anguish, and
[2:16:00] you're no longer defending yourself,
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; you're not excusing your failure, but
[2:16:06] you're crying, "Create in me a clean
[2:16:09] heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit
[2:16:13] in me, because it's against thee, and
[2:16:16] thee only have I sinned.
[2:16:23] You see, Esau sought repentance with
[2:16:25] tears, but he couldn't find it because
[2:16:28] he wanted the blessing without
[2:16:29] brokenness.
[2:16:32] Many will do the same today. They throw
[2:16:34] away their birth right with sin
[2:16:39] and pretending then is as if nothing
[2:16:42] nothing happened. I throw away my
[2:16:44] birthright, but I still want the
[2:16:45] blessing. God still blessed me.
[2:16:48] They want their reputation restored.
[2:16:50] They want their position recovered. They
[2:16:52] want their influence re renewed, but not
[2:16:55] their heart cleansed.
[2:16:58] You see, again, godly sorrow
[2:17:02] workketh repentance to salvation, not to
[2:17:06] be repented of, but the sorrow of the
[2:17:09] world workketh death.
[2:17:12] So you see, it's not a nobody's perfect.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; That don't bring salvation.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; Well, everybody else makes mistakes,
[2:17:23] too.
[2:17:25] You know what it is? Is Lord have mercy
[2:17:27] on me. I'm a sinner.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; I need Jesus.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. The moment we start justifying our
[2:17:34] sins by pointing to the failures of
[2:17:36] others, that's when repentance dies.
[2:17:40] God will not accept that he's calling
[2:17:43] for a bride who does not excuse her sin
[2:17:46] but overcomes it.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Hear me now. I want to say to you
[2:17:51] overcome because you are not called to
[2:17:53] quit. You are called to conquer.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; You're not to called to explain your
[2:17:59] failure. You are called to rise in
[2:18:01] victory.
[2:18:03] You're called to defeat Satan on his own
[2:18:06] grounds right here in Satan's Eden.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; God did not rise you up today to be
[2:18:15] passive and compromising and contempt
[2:18:18] with live lives some devil in your life.
[2:18:21] Do you know that people today have grown
[2:18:24] accustomed
[2:18:26] to coexisting with their bondage?
[2:18:30] They've learned to live with attitudes
[2:18:32] and appetites that that the cross was
[2:18:34] meant to crucify.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; You You see, some will excuse a temper.
[2:18:39] Well, my daddy had one.
[2:18:42] Others will justify a spirit of lust or
[2:18:44] pride or worldliness that manifests
[2:18:47] itself in countless ways. Anger, vanity,
[2:18:50] stubbornness, gossip, rebellion,
[2:18:52] self-will.
[2:18:54] But I listen to me now. You're not
[2:18:56] called with to live with that.
[2:18:59] The Bible said in Ephesians 4:27,
[2:19:02] "Neither give no place to the devil."
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham prayed one time
[2:19:08] and he said, "God, never let Satan crown
[2:19:11] me with an old crab indifferent spirit
[2:19:14] or my wife with a nagging spirit." Well,
[2:19:17] that's a prayer every one of us ought to
[2:19:19] pray.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; And he said, especially as we get older,
[2:19:23] we got pains in our body and we make
[2:19:25] excuse for our crabiness.
[2:19:28] and our contrariness and how mean we are
[2:19:31] and how ugly we are to others.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. This ain't a time to make excuses
[2:19:37] about your crabiness. It's a time to
[2:19:39] repent of it.
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; Bring it to the altar and kill it.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; I preached like this in a convention one
[2:19:46] time in Ohio. And I tell you what, a man
[2:19:48] came to me and he came to me in that
[2:19:50] meeting. He walked up. He was an elderly
[2:19:52] man. He walked up and he said, "Brother
[2:19:54] Tim, you describe me. I've got that crab
[2:19:56] ugly spirit. I want it off of me. I come
[2:19:58] to repent today.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; I met him. I met him here just the other
[2:20:02] day. I don't know how he lived that long
[2:20:04] because he was an old man to me back
[2:20:05] then. He was still older.
[2:20:08] And he walked up to me and he said, "I'm
[2:20:10] that man that you prayed for 20
[2:20:12] something years ago, Brother Tim, over
[2:20:14] that crabid spirit." And it's gone and
[2:20:16] is kept dead.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, the gospel will work.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to let it work.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; We want our lives instead of being
[2:20:30] crowned with a crabid spirit, we want to
[2:20:32] be crowned with the fruit of the spirit,
[2:20:34] with love and joy and peace and
[2:20:36] longsuffering and gentleness and
[2:20:38] goodness and meekness and temperance and
[2:20:40] patience.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; Oh my, that's a mark of the Holy Ghost.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; That's the crown of character that we
[2:20:48] want. So, I'm telling you, don't excuse
[2:20:51] your temper
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; just because your father had one.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; And let me just say to you, father, if
[2:20:59] you pass that down, God help you.
[2:21:04] The gospel should live in your home.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; Don't justify lust because men are just
[2:21:12] that way.
[2:21:17] Men are that way.
[2:21:19] But not Holy Ghost men.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Don't explain it with your bitterness,
[2:21:25] your pride, your jealousy, or your
[2:21:27] worldly habits. Cuz I'm just human.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; That's not your nature anymore.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the Bible said, "Old things
[2:21:38] are passed away. Behold, all things are
[2:21:40] new." And when you're born again, you're
[2:21:42] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[2:21:45] No, it didn't take away your human
[2:21:47] emotion or natural desire. It redeemed
[2:21:49] it, though.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; And it brought it under control. And the
[2:21:54] Holy Ghost don't erase passion. It
[2:21:56] channels it in God's boundaries.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; If you're married, it makes marriage
[2:22:01] honorable in the bed undefiled.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. But otherwise, you're a harm and
[2:22:05] adulterer.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost don't don't destroy
[2:22:09] desire. It sanctifies it. It gives you a
[2:22:12] holy taste. How many heard thinking
[2:22:15] man's filter?
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon preached on that. A
[2:22:18] thinking man's filter gives a holy man's
[2:22:20] taste.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you ever get the thinking man's
[2:22:23] filter of the Holy Ghost, it'll give you
[2:22:25] the taste for the things that are right.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; You see, but it don't kill your
[2:22:29] personality. It crucifies the fleshly
[2:22:32] nature that once ruled you. And it puts
[2:22:34] your emotions under the government of
[2:22:36] the word. And and if you're unmarried,
[2:22:39] it gives you the power to flee, to turn
[2:22:42] away from youthful lust.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; They that are Christ have crucified the
[2:22:49] flesh with the affections thereof and
[2:22:52] the lust. So I'm telling you, don't make
[2:22:55] peace with sin.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; You can't feed the flesh. You'll never
[2:23:00] tame it. It's untameable. And if you
[2:23:02] feed it, it'll rise up and destroy you
[2:23:06] and your testimony.
[2:23:09] So let me tell you, that's why holiness
[2:23:13] is preached, not as control, but as
[2:23:16] protection.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; The boundaries of the word will keep the
[2:23:20] beast behind the bars.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll cause you to walk in the
[2:23:24] spirit so that you don't fulfill the
[2:23:27] lust of the flesh.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. that gives you power to overcome.
[2:23:32] Why? Because let me give you a simple
[2:23:35] scripture and it's a profound one. Not
[2:23:37] just simple, it's profound. Romans 6:14.
[2:23:40] For sin, listen to me. For sin shall not
[2:23:44] have dominion over you, for you are not
[2:23:48] under the law,
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; but under grace.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; Now, let's get the first part. Sin shall
[2:23:56] not have dominion over you. Amen.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; Rule number one.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; Rule number two, it tells you why.
[2:24:04] Because you're not under the law. Now,
[2:24:06] why does Paul give this distinction?
[2:24:08] We're not under the law, but under
[2:24:10] grace. Because under the law,
[2:24:12] commandments was given to show us
[2:24:15] holiness, but not the power to live it.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; So, the law could not could point out
[2:24:22] sin, but it couldn't conquer it. In the
[2:24:24] old covenant, the worshipper offered a
[2:24:26] life of a innocent animal as a
[2:24:29] substitute. But that life that was shed
[2:24:31] in the altar could never return on the
[2:24:34] worshipper. And it could cover sin, but
[2:24:36] it couldn't change the sinner.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; But under grace, everything changes.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; This is why Paul said, "You're not under
[2:24:44] the law." The life of your sacrifice,
[2:24:47] the very life of Jesus Christ comes back
[2:24:50] upon the believer. It enters the soul
[2:24:52] and that empowers you to live above the
[2:24:55] dominion of sin.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; So grace doesn't excuse sin. It empowers
[2:25:03] you to overcome it.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; And the life that you that was once
[2:25:10] offered for you now which is Christ now
[2:25:13] lives in you and gives you the strength
[2:25:15] to rise above your shameful past. That's
[2:25:19] why you can break the cycle. Now, I'm
[2:25:23] I'm going to I'm going to just deal with
[2:25:26] a couple of more little points here and
[2:25:29] and then then we will bring this down to
[2:25:31] our close. But I want you I want you to
[2:25:35] get something.
[2:25:37] There's something else I want to deal
[2:25:39] with
[2:25:42] because some of you that are sitting
[2:25:45] right here
[2:25:47] are under the sound of my voice or will
[2:25:49] be hearing this later.
[2:25:52] You're carrying wounds that run deep.
[2:26:01] And and you say to me, "But brother Tim,
[2:26:07] you don't understand. You just don't
[2:26:09] know what happened to me."
[2:26:13] And you're right. I probably don't.
[2:26:17] You know
[2:26:20] that. But though I don't know it, I I
[2:26:22] don't doubt it for a minute.
[2:26:25] Those things were real. They were
[2:26:26] hurtful. They were wrongs.
[2:26:30] They were done to you.
[2:26:35] And I don't doubt you've been hurt
[2:26:38] and that you've been abused
[2:26:40] and mistreated
[2:26:44] some by parents who should have loved
[2:26:47] you.
[2:26:49] You went through horrible things. Broken
[2:26:52] homes, abandoned, forgotten, abused.
[2:26:57] Some by people who betrayed your trust.
[2:27:01] Some even by churches or pastors who
[2:27:04] were supposed to protect you.
[2:27:09] And many people will ask, why?
[2:27:13] Why? Why did God let this happen to me?
[2:27:20] and they look at the heartache, the sin,
[2:27:22] the disease, the brokenness in the
[2:27:24] world, and they wind up laying the blame
[2:27:27] at the feet of God.
[2:27:31] And they say, "If God is so great, if he
[2:27:33] cares, well, why didn't he intervene in
[2:27:36] my situation?
[2:27:39] Why did I go through this awful thing in
[2:27:42] my life that hurt me, that damaged me,
[2:27:45] that I'm this damaged goods as it was?
[2:27:50] Why did God, where was he when I went
[2:27:52] through all of that?
[2:27:55] But let's back up for a minute. I want
[2:27:58] you to remember God made a perfect
[2:28:01] world.
[2:28:03] That's how he made it.
[2:28:06] In six days he created an Eden of
[2:28:09] paradise. And there was no pain. There
[2:28:11] was no sorrow. There was no sin. There
[2:28:14] was no death. Everything was harmony.
[2:28:16] Man walking with God. Heaven and earth
[2:28:18] united.
[2:28:20] It was heaven on earth called Eden.
[2:28:25] But it wasn't God who ruined perfection.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; Man did.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; Adam chose disobedience. He he reached
[2:28:35] for the fruit of death. And when he did,
[2:28:38] he sold the whole human race into the
[2:28:41] slavery to sin. And friends,
[2:28:45] none of us was born free.
[2:28:50] We were born in bondage, in sin,
[2:28:54] chained, slaved.
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; And awful things happen to those that
[2:29:02] are in slavery.
[2:29:05] that they had nothing to do with
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; things that they didn't want. Childhoods
[2:29:11] they didn't want
[2:29:16] abuses they never asked for.
[2:29:22] But what happened when Adam sold it
[2:29:25] the whole human race? That means he sold
[2:29:28] all his offspring to be slaves.
[2:29:34] to come under the bondage of sin and sin
[2:29:37] nature and for Satan to rule.
[2:29:43] And in doing so, he surrendered the
[2:29:45] whole earth and the dominion of the
[2:29:48] earth to Satan.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; And right now, Satan is the one who
[2:29:53] rules the earth.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; He is called the god of this world. He's
[2:29:59] called the god of this evil age.
[2:30:03] This is not heaven.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; This is not even. This is not the
[2:30:08] millennium.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; This is hell.
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; I know there's a burning place,
[2:30:18] but let me tell you, if you're a
[2:30:20] Christian today, this is the closest to
[2:30:21] hell you'll ever come.
[2:30:27] And if you're not, then this is the
[2:30:30] closest to heaven you'll ever come.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; If you don't surrender your life to
[2:30:35] Christ,
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; the Bible said in Romans 5:12, "For one
[2:30:43] by one man's sin
[2:30:45] entered into the world, and death by
[2:30:47] sin, so death passed on all men."
[2:30:52] And that's why there's murders, rapes,
[2:30:55] broken homes, fatherless children, and
[2:30:58] disease. Man's choice.
[2:31:03] It's not God's fault. It's the fault of
[2:31:05] man's sin.
[2:31:07] We were born in bodies that decay.
[2:31:10] We are we're born with minds that
[2:31:13] wrestle with sin.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But God never has abandoned his
[2:31:17] creation. From the moment of the fall,
[2:31:20] he began to work on restoration. And
[2:31:22] that's why Jesus came. He came to redeem
[2:31:25] the soul, to begin the transformation
[2:31:27] that would one day prepare us for a
[2:31:29] perfect world again. He came to break
[2:31:32] the curse, to lift man out of death and
[2:31:34] bring him back to life again.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; Now listen, listen. We are here on earth
[2:31:41] and we're only here temporarily and for
[2:31:43] a time
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; but already he started redemption
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; and that redemption is in your soul.
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Your body will still go still go
[2:31:54] through pains, through trials, through
[2:31:55] tests, through every kind of things and
[2:31:57] hell because we are not in a redeemed
[2:32:00] state in this body. It's our soul that
[2:32:02] has been redeemed.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; But glory be to God, he's not going to
[2:32:06] leave it that way forever.
[2:32:09] The dead in Christ shall rise first,
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; and we that are alive and remain shall
[2:32:14] be caught up to meet the Lord in the
[2:32:16] air. For in a moment, in a twinkling of
[2:32:18] an eye, we will be changed.
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; And we'll no longer be in this obly body
[2:32:24] of flesh
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; that is subject to trials and tests and
[2:32:29] abuses and hurts,
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; but we'll be changed
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; and we'll have a body like his own
[2:32:35] glorious body.
[2:32:38] one where only dwells righteousness.
[2:32:45] So right now
[2:32:50] you ask me, well then why don't God stop
[2:32:53] the tide of evil? Well, if he had did it
[2:32:58] on my time,
[2:33:00] it would have happened 50 years ago or
[2:33:02] more.
[2:33:06] 50 years I'll be flying to France and 50
[2:33:10] years on the 23rd day of October I
[2:33:13] married my wife. We started out our life
[2:33:18] together have four wonderful children.
[2:33:22] If I would have chose
[2:33:25] I'd have wanted it to happen even before
[2:33:27] I got married. But God had four children
[2:33:30] in mind.
[2:33:33] But God only had four children in mind.
[2:33:36] He had their spouses in mind
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; and they weren't even born.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; So if he'd have called it all to halt
[2:33:44] and there would have been no more sorrow
[2:33:46] and trouble and everything in all
[2:33:47] heaven. You see, you have to be born
[2:33:50] here.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; In order to be born again,
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; in order to live there. So, we have been
[2:33:57] waiting on those whose names are in the
[2:34:00] lamb's book of life to be manifested on
[2:34:02] the earth. And then when the last one
[2:34:04] comes in, God will call a halt.
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; But until he does, we don't want to
[2:34:09] leave a hook behind.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; I want you to go. If I can get you to go
[2:34:14] to heaven with me. I want you to go. I
[2:34:16] don't want to leave you behind.
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; I want you there.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; It just wouldn't seem like heaven
[2:34:24] without you.
[2:34:34] Revelation 21:21.
[2:34:37] And I saw
[2:34:39] a new heaven and a new earth.
[2:34:44] Revelation 21:1.
[2:34:47] I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
[2:34:50] And then he continues,
[2:34:56] "And there shall be no more death,
[2:34:58] neither sorrow nor crying, and neither
[2:35:03] shall there be any more pain.
[2:35:11] Who's going to be there?
[2:35:15] Those who broke the cycle.
[2:35:18] Those
[2:35:20] who refused
[2:35:22] to let the past
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; determine their future.
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; Those who stood up and faced it and
[2:35:30] said, "This was given to me.
[2:35:33] This catastrophe in life, this
[2:35:36] abandonment,
[2:35:38] this hurt, this harm, it was all there.
[2:35:42] And Satan would use it to try to keep me
[2:35:44] down. But there was something greater on
[2:35:47] the inside of me. And that was the life
[2:35:50] of Christ that overcome.
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; And I am an overcomer. I rise above it.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to stand there on that day
[2:35:58] as a champion of the grace of God, of
[2:36:01] his mercy, of his love, and I'm going to
[2:36:03] testify.
[2:36:05] You never left me in my hard time. You
[2:36:07] never walked away from me. You've been
[2:36:09] there throughout every trial, through
[2:36:11] every test. You always been there.
[2:36:15] You've never left me fighting alone.
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; Cuz he said when he said Hebrews 13:8,
[2:36:22] which we know so well, he said in that
[2:36:25] same passage of scripture, I will never
[2:36:28] leave you or forsake you.
[2:36:37] Let's
[2:36:44] stand together.
[2:36:51] We're in a vicious fight.
[2:36:54] Living in an imperfect world.
[2:37:00] I wish I had the time to go on and to
[2:37:04] tell you
[2:37:06] of why that in this mind of yours
[2:37:10] there's still a battle.
[2:37:13] I'd like to be able to stand to you and
[2:37:15] tell you about the battleground
[2:37:19] and how to win that war.
[2:37:23] But I'm just going to simply tell you
[2:37:26] as the musicians have come and we begin
[2:37:30] to close this service.
[2:37:32] I'm just going to tell you very briefly
[2:37:38] that the attacks on your mind is not
[2:37:41] you.
[2:37:43] Is the enemy trying to pull you who are
[2:37:47] redeemed,
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; bought with the blood, pull you down
[2:37:52] where you don't walk in victory.
[2:37:57] &gt;&gt; And if you don't recognize the voice of
[2:37:59] your enemy and silence him by the word,
[2:38:03] you will walk in defeat.
[2:38:10] The reason that cloud of depression is
[2:38:12] on you is not because God put it there.
[2:38:16] &gt;&gt; It's because you allowed Satan to keep
[2:38:19] it there when you were told to cast down
[2:38:23] strongholds
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; and every imagination
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; that exalts itself against the word of
[2:38:31] God. And I'm going to tell you right
[2:38:33] now, if you're going to break the cycle,
[2:38:35] you got to start it right there. You're
[2:38:37] going to have to take the word and break
[2:38:39] it.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; Disciple.
[2:38:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; That war within your mind where the
[2:38:44] devil comes time after time bombarding
[2:38:47] you in your mind. You can't make it.
[2:38:49] You're not You're not who you say you
[2:38:51] are. You You're not worthy. You're not
[2:38:53] any count. You're no good. I'll tell you
[2:38:55] how good you are. He went to Calvary for
[2:38:58] you. He gave his life for you. He
[2:39:00] redeemed you by his blood. You are his
[2:39:03] blood washed, bloodbought son or
[2:39:04] daughter. the living God redeemed by the
[2:39:07] blood of the lamb.
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; Don't walk in defeat.
[2:39:12] &gt;&gt; You've been called to walk in victory
[2:39:15] &gt;&gt; and start with taking control of what's
[2:39:18] in your mind
[2:39:20] &gt;&gt; and bringing it subject to the word of
[2:39:22] God
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; and say, "I can do all things through
[2:39:26] Christ that strengthenth me. I'm not a
[2:39:28] quitter. I am a winner.
[2:39:32] &gt;&gt; I am an overcomer. I will overcome. How?
[2:39:36] By the blood of the lamb.
[2:39:38] &gt;&gt; And by testifying what he said about me.
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; So if he said he redeemed me, he
[2:39:43] redeemed me. If he saved me, he saved
[2:39:45] me. Amen. Whatever he said, I'm going to
[2:39:47] say yes, Lord.
[2:39:49] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say yes.
[2:39:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:39:56] Father,
[2:39:58] today
[2:40:00] as I've labored here long,
[2:40:07] as I've stood here in this pulpit now
[2:40:09] for a couple hours,
[2:40:15] I've done it, Lord, to try to deliver a
[2:40:17] word to these your children.
[2:40:22] Sometimes, Lord, we feel inadequate to
[2:40:25] be able to say it precisely. But I pray
[2:40:29] that it went, Lord, like an arrow to its
[2:40:32] target, hitting the bullseye.
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; It was the arrow of deliverance that you
[2:40:36] put in my hand today. And I'm speaking
[2:40:39] deliverance over this people right now.
[2:40:42] I'm I'm I'm speaking to deliverance over
[2:40:46] that battle that's in their mind, that
[2:40:48] war that's in their flesh. I'm speaking
[2:40:51] to them deliverance today because there
[2:40:53] is a power of the overcomer that can
[2:40:56] rise in their heart, sit upon their
[2:40:58] throne, and cause them to be enthroned
[2:41:00] with him where they rule and they reign
[2:41:04] with Christ.
[2:41:06] Not just in the millennium ahead, but
[2:41:08] right now, Lord, I pray in the name of
[2:41:11] Jesus, you bless your children.
[2:41:19] Speak, Lord.
[2:41:21] Speak right now.
[2:41:25] Take the word, Lord.
[2:41:28] Let it be like a knife, a surgeon's
[2:41:30] knife that just goes out, cuts out
[2:41:32] unbelief.
[2:41:34] I pray, Lord, right here in Evening
[2:41:36] Light Tabernacle, there will be a
[2:41:37] repentance.
[2:41:39] A repentance
[2:41:41] starting from the pulpit to the back pew
[2:41:43] to all the way back.
[2:41:46] Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus
[2:41:51] that every heart will humble themselves
[2:41:53] before you so they can hear from heaven.
[2:41:58] I pray that today they'll take the sword
[2:42:00] of the word and they'll
[2:42:03] [Music]
[2:42:05] they will break through those clouds.
[2:42:08] There's a sun to shine.
[2:42:11] It's just clouds that's holding it back.
[2:42:14] There you are in your glory and your
[2:42:15] power.
[2:42:17] It's just clouds that are holding it
[2:42:19] back.
[2:42:23] Demonic powers, demonic influence,
[2:42:25] spirits of depression,
[2:42:29] things that want to cloud our minds, our
[2:42:31] hearts.
[2:42:33] But I pray, Lord, there will be a
[2:42:34] purging all the way today. That every
[2:42:37] cloud will be dispersed and your
[2:42:39] children can walk in victory.
[2:42:42] that every man, woman, boy, and girl in
[2:42:44] here can walk in freedom.
[2:42:47] Cuz though they were born in slavery,
[2:42:51] you came to set us free. And you said he
[2:42:53] that the son is made free is free
[2:42:55] indeed.
[2:42:57] Let them walk in that freedom today.
[2:43:00] In the name of Jesus.
[2:43:03] Amen.
[2:43:05] I am redeemed. Been bought with a price.
[2:43:09] Jesus
[2:43:11] has changed my whole life.

[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; And if he

[2:45:28] his goodness
[2:45:30] to me.
[2:45:32] [Music]
[2:45:34] Well, he purchased my redemption
[2:45:39] with his own precious blood and from
[2:45:44] sin.

[2:51:11] you
[2:51:13] grace.
[2:51:16] All that I adore
[2:51:21] is in me.

[2:51:48] every moment I'm away,
[2:51:53] Lord, have your way.
[2:52:00] For this is my
[2:52:04] desire
[2:52:07] to honor
[2:52:11] you.
[2:52:12] Oh
[2:52:14] Lord, with all my heart
[2:52:19] I worship you.

[2:53:04] I live for you alone.
[2:53:09] breath that I take.

[2:53:22] give you my heart.
[2:53:25] I give you my soul.
[2:53:30] I'll live for you long.
[2:53:35] Every breath that I take,
[2:53:38] every moment I'm aware,
[2:53:42] [Music]
[2:53:44] have your way.
[2:53:48] [Music]
[2:53:54] He came to live,
[2:53:58] live again.
[2:54:01] He came to be
[2:54:04] our living word of life. He came to die
[2:54:10] so we may reconcile.
[2:54:14] He came to rise
[2:54:17] to show his power and might. And that's
[2:54:22] why we praise him. That's why we sing.
