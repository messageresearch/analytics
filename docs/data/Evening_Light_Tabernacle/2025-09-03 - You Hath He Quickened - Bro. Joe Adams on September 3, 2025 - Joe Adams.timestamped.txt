[19:07] Lighthouse if you don't know. So, amen.

[19:14] few different arrangements. Brother Tim
[19:16] was going to ride back with us, but we
[19:17] made arrangements for him to fly home

[19:24] day there. So, Amen. We're thankful for
[19:26] that. And we have some prayer requests
[19:28] we want to bring tonight before the

[19:33] Sister Sarah Field's dad. It's also
[19:37] Sister Amy Mitchell's dad was diagnosed
[19:40] with uh bone cancer. He's been having to
[19:44] receive blood transfusions. He's very
[19:46] weak in body physically having a
[19:49] difficult time. So, just want to ask the
[19:51] Lord to remember him. Brother Larry, he
[19:54] actually used to attend this church and
[19:56] so just want to remember him that the
[19:59] Lord would be merciful to him. Also,
[20:02] brother Jason Tagert asked us to
[20:04] remember little Hunter Tagert for his
[20:07] complete healing. And I believe that
[20:09] he's that kind of God. Amen. That it
[20:12] doesn't matter. There's nothing too hard
[20:13] for the Lord and thankful to serve a God
[20:16] like that. So, let's just go to prayer.
[20:18] Father, we just come to you today, Lord,
[20:20] just so thankful we can bow our heads
[20:23] before a living God and a God who can
[20:25] answer and a God who can move on our
[20:27] needs. And sometimes, Lord, in our human
[20:30] abilities and our human eyes, we cannot
[20:32] we can't see things happening. But Lord,
[20:35] we do know that you're working even when
[20:37] we don't see you working. And Lord, we
[20:39] just ask, Father, that you would come
[20:41] and minister to every heart and every
[20:43] need that's here tonight. We ask,
[20:45] Father, you meet, Lord, this need for
[20:47] Brother Larry. Father, you need see the
[20:49] need in his body. And Lord, not only his
[20:52] body, but his spirit and soul, Father,
[20:54] that you can just touch him, Lord, in
[20:55] this time.
[20:57] Lord, draw close to him and draw him
[20:59] close to you. We pray, Lord, for little
[21:02] Hunter. Lord, we ask, God, that you'd
[21:03] bring a complete healing to that little
[21:05] body. Lord, I'm so thankful to be able
[21:07] to call out upon you in confidence,
[21:09] knowing that there's nothing too hard
[21:11] for you. But Lord, we can ask anything
[21:14] in your name and it can be done. And
[21:16] Lord, we're asking today because we
[21:18] believe you're that kind of God. And you
[21:20] can answer, Lord, every need that's on
[21:21] our hearts. And every need that we have,
[21:24] no matter how big or how small or how
[21:26] insignificant we may think it is, Lord
[21:29] God, you're mindful of every part of it.
[21:32] Lord, today we ask that you would bless
[21:34] this service with your presence, Lord.
[21:36] You'll bless the songs and the worship,
[21:38] Lord, the specials, the offering. God,
[21:40] you bless the ministering of your word.
[21:42] Lord, as brother Joe would come, may you
[21:44] just, Lord, so ignite his heart to
[21:46] preach the word of God, Lord. And may it
[21:48] not only ignite his heart, but may
[21:50] ignite our hearts to receive your word,
[21:52] Lord. And that word, Lord, just take
[21:54] preeminence in our bodies and our
[21:56] spirits and our minds, Father, that we
[21:59] can follow after your will and your way.
[22:01] We pray with everything that was in us.
[22:03] We ask, God, that you'll just bless
[22:04] every part of this service. We ask you
[22:06] for your glory in Jesus name. Amen.

[32:43] For he's my father.
[32:47] always
[32:49] loves me.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; He always guides me.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, he guides me through mountains and
[33:04] in valley.
[33:08] Oh, the joy
[33:11] joy is refreshing
[33:17] restores my soul.

[33:39] &gt;&gt; I'll see his glory.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; I'll see it face
[33:47] to face.
[33:53] Oh,
[33:55] hallelujah.
[33:59] I am

[34:37] For he's my comfort.
[34:42] [Music]
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Sing hallelujah.
[34:55] Lord, I am not alone.
[35:04] He's my comfort.
[35:07] He's my comfort.
[35:11] Always
[35:12] holds me close.
[35:16] Sing halleluah.
[35:23] Hallelujah.
[35:24] [Music]
[35:25] I am not alone.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; He's my comfort.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; He my comfort
[35:42] holds me close.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Father,
[35:48] so thankful we have a comforter tonight.
[35:51] Lord, you would tell us when you
[35:52] departed that I'll send a a comforter.
[35:57] Lord, one that would be with us even to
[35:59] the very end. And Lord, here we are at
[36:02] the waning of time, Lord, the ending of
[36:05] the Gentile dispensation.
[36:07] And you're just as real today as you
[36:09] were then. Your word is just as true and
[36:12] effectual as it was, Lord, when you
[36:15] first spoke those words. Thank you for
[36:17] sending us a comfort. Thank you, God,
[36:20] for the message of the hour. Lord, our
[36:22] hearts have been, Lord, enthralled and
[36:25] enthrilled and enraptured with your
[36:26] presence, God. Thank you for the truth
[36:29] that you have given us, Lord. Thank you
[36:31] for hearts, a bedding ground that can
[36:33] receive the word. We just ask that you'd
[36:36] come by once again this evening,
[36:39] Lord, as you had visited us many times,
[36:41] Lord, service after service. Lord, we
[36:43] know it's not about a man standing
[36:45] before your people, Lord, lecturing with
[36:47] his intellect, but Father, it's you
[36:50] coming anointing that word, that gift
[36:52] that you've placed there, anointing the
[36:54] people to receive from it, to pull what
[36:56] they have need of. And we invite you and
[36:58] ask that you would do that tonight. May
[37:00] there be such an atmosphere, such a
[37:02] charge of the spirit, God, you would
[37:04] direct the service however you would
[37:06] choose, Lord, tonight. And your people
[37:08] will be blessed and you will receive all
[37:10] the honor. For we ask it now in Jesus
[37:13] name. Amen. If you have your Bibles
[37:15] tonight, we're going to look here in
[37:17] Romans 8. Going to pick back up kind of
[37:19] a little bit on where we were preaching
[37:20] on Sunday. We spoke on predestinated to
[37:23] quickening power. Tonight, I want to
[37:25] speak to you on you hath he quickened.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; So when we look at this, I want you to
[37:31] make sure you put your name into that
[37:34] scripture.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; You hath he quickened. Not your
[37:38] neighbor, not the ministry, not the
[37:40] deacons and different ones that we hold
[37:42] in high esteem. But I want you to put
[37:44] yourself there tonight. And we find here
[37:47] in Romans 8 and verse 9 says, "But you
[37:49] are not in the flesh, but in the spirit.
[37:52] If so be that the spirit of God dwell in
[37:54] you. Now if any man have not the spirit
[37:57] of Christ, and he is none of his. And if
[38:00] Christ be in you, the body is dead
[38:02] because of sin, but the spirit is life
[38:05] because of righteousness. But if the
[38:07] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[38:09] the dead dwell in you, he that raised up
[38:12] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[38:14] your mortal bodies by the spirit that
[38:17] dwelleth in you. Let's look also in
[38:19] Ephesians 2 and verse one.
[38:22] Ephesians 2 and verse one
[38:25] and we'll have you be seated. It says,
[38:27] "And you hath he quickened
[38:30] you."
[38:32] &gt;&gt; You mean me? No, I mean you.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Not me. You. And sometimes we look at
[38:37] ourselves, you mean me? Yes, I mean you.
[38:40] You hath he quickened who were dead in
[38:43] sins and trespasses. God bless you. You
[38:46] can have your seats tonight.
[38:50] Just want to without a show of hands
[38:52] just how many of you have ever really
[38:53] struggled
[38:55] about your your your eternal destination
[38:58] or maybe struggle with your salvation,
[39:00] struggle with your past, constantly
[39:02] coming up and reminding you of the
[39:04] things that you've done.
[39:05] I dare to say probably all of us at some
[39:08] point through our journey maybe even
[39:09] within the week the day we struggle with
[39:12] these kind of things but we find here
[39:14] Paul he's saying and you had he
[39:16] quickened who were
[39:18] &gt;&gt; notice that's past tense that's not what
[39:20] you are tonight that's past tense that's
[39:23] what you were you were dead that word
[39:26] dead there means destitute of lifeless
[39:29] no spiritual life in you at all you were
[39:32] down in sins and trespasses
[39:34] Then he says, "Where in times past you
[39:37] walked according to the course of this
[39:39] world, according to the prince of the
[39:41] power of the air, the spirit that now
[39:44] workketh in the children of
[39:45] disobedience, among whom also we all."
[39:48] So notice, you're not alone.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Misery loves company. Come on, somebody.
[39:53] You're not alone in that. We all were
[39:55] sinners. We all walked according to the
[39:57] the desires of the flesh and had our
[40:00] conversations in time past in the lust
[40:02] of the flesh. fulfilling the desires of
[40:04] the flesh and of the mind and were by
[40:07] nature the children of wrath even as
[40:09] others. Notice this is what you were.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody stake that claim down.
[40:15] That's what I was. That's not what I am
[40:18] tonight.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Don't let your past dictate your future.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Don't let your past dictate who you are
[40:26] tonight. Look at the word and what the
[40:28] word says about you. You may have been
[40:30] in sin. You may have been dead. You may
[40:33] have done these things, but that's not
[40:35] who you are tonight.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; You got a promise laying in the
[40:39] scripture. You had him quickened.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Make it personal tonight. I've been
[40:44] quickened. I've been made alive.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Not by some man's idea, not by some
[40:50] church denomination, not some some
[40:52] system, but you have been made alive by
[40:55] the quickening power of almighty God.
[40:58] Hallelujah.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Even when we were dead, listen, when we
[41:02] were dead in sins, verse five, hath he
[41:06] quickened us together with Christ.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; And by grace you are saved, and hath
[41:13] raised us up together, and made us sit
[41:14] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; So, let me just state the obvious. If
[41:22] you're sitting in heavenly places, then
[41:23] why are you dwelling on your failures?
[41:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. I mean, if you're sitting
[41:28] in heavenly places, why you dwelling on
[41:30] your past?
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; No, but you've been quickened. Yes, sir.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; You've been made alive by the power of
[41:40] God. Somebody needs this tonight.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Somebody, the devil's been reminding you
[41:44] of your failures. Maybe you had a bad
[41:46] past, a bad childhood, a bad upbringing,
[41:48] and everything's been horrible in your
[41:50] life. Everything's been wrong, and you
[41:52] wonder, "How did I make it here?" You
[41:54] made it here because God had
[41:55] predestinated you to be quickened by the
[41:58] power of the word. And he's going to
[41:59] remind you tonight that I am here. I'm
[42:02] still God. I'm still on the scene. And I
[42:04] come to quicken you tonight to quicken
[42:06] the word to you.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; That you quit dwelling in the past and
[42:11] dwell in heavenly places
[42:12] &gt;&gt; cuz that's the believer's position in
[42:14] Christ.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Notice we look here in Colossians 2 and
[42:19] verse 13. Colossians 2 verse 13 it says
[42:22] and you here it goes again you know Paul
[42:25] has a way of making things personal
[42:30] &gt;&gt; oh you know it's all wait let me get my
[42:32] pitchfork and pitch it to brother
[42:33] Timothy he needs this no you tonight
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Paul ain't dressing Timothy he's already
[42:38] addressed Timothy in another book
[42:42] &gt;&gt; but he's addressing you tonight he's
[42:44] saying and you being dead
[42:47] &gt;&gt; in your sins and uncircumcision visions
[42:50] of your flesh. Hath he quickened?
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hath he made alive? Is anybody
[42:58] alive tonight?
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, that was a week,
[43:03] &gt;&gt; man. And if you just only recall, if you
[43:05] can just be in the intensity of when you
[43:08] was a sinner and be thankful for what
[43:10] God had brought you from the life that
[43:12] he brought you from the things that you
[43:14] used to do, the desires that you used to
[43:17] crave. But God, rich in mercy, came by
[43:20] your way and he brought you a word and
[43:22] he quickened. What did he do? He
[43:24] quickened that predestinated seed that
[43:26] laid on the inside of you and he brought
[43:28] it to life. You never was alive until
[43:31] you've been quickened by the power of
[43:32] God. Amen.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Notice what it says. And you hath he
[43:36] quickened together with him, having
[43:38] forgiven all of your trespasses.
[43:41] [Music]
[43:43] &gt;&gt; All of them.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Notice what it says in verse 14,
[43:50] blotting out the handwriting of
[43:52] ordinance that was against you, which
[43:54] was contrary to us, and took it out of
[43:57] the way, nailing it to the cross.
[44:00] So we have a common theme here in
[44:02] Colossians and in Ephesians. We find
[44:04] Paul telling us that without the spirit
[44:07] of God, you are not his. You're dead.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; But he don't leave you in a dead state.
[44:13] Somebody, he don't leave you the way he
[44:15] found you. But he quickens you. He makes
[44:17] you alive to believe the word, to
[44:20] respond to the word.
[44:23] Oh, you may be a good person, morally
[44:24] clean, attend church regularly, live
[44:27] godly, but without God's spirit, the
[44:28] Bible says you're none of his.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; So, we find Paul reminds us, he tells
[44:35] us, look what God has done for you. Some
[44:37] of y'all tonight need to look back and
[44:39] see what God's done for you.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; Look what he's done for you. Hath
[44:45] quickened you together with him, having
[44:48] forgiven.
[44:52] How many of you have ever had a debt
[44:54] forgiven?
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, a handful of them, man. I bet you
[44:58] just like, "Oh, well, you know what?
[45:01] &gt;&gt; I appreciate that."
[45:03] &gt;&gt; No.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; No. You get a debt forgiven. You jumping
[45:07] around like some idiot,
[45:10] &gt;&gt; man. You all on the black. Yeah. You
[45:12] calling people on the phone. Guess what?
[45:14] So and so just forgave me. I I can't
[45:17] believe in myself. Come on.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; And we come to the house of God. God
[45:21] done changed your life. God done forgave
[45:23] you of your sins. He done erased your
[45:25] past. And we sit there. We got a reason
[45:28] to shout.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; He blotted out the handwriting of
[45:32] ordinances that were against you.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Blooding out means he obliterated.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; He erased it. He wiped it out.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; How'd he do it, brother? He put a blood
[45:46] on top of your sins and said, "No more
[45:51] &gt;&gt; no more
[45:53] &gt;&gt; will I be reminded of their sins. No
[45:55] more will I be reminded of the
[45:57] trespasses."
[46:01] &gt;&gt; The handwriting, that word there, it
[46:03] means a legal document
[46:05] &gt;&gt; that you signed.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; I accept this debt.
[46:12] And you know they say in the eastern
[46:14] custom that that debt whether it be
[46:17] worked off or paid for it was in effect
[46:20] until it was either canceled or
[46:22] forgiven.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; And look what Jesus did. The Bible says
[46:27] that he obliterated.
[46:30] He obliterated the handwriting. that
[46:32] binding document that had you bound by
[46:36] sin, bound by lust, bound by this and
[46:39] bound by that that that that family
[46:41] strain or that whatever that
[46:43] generational curse or that habit you
[46:45] were bound by. You couldn't break away
[46:47] from it. But the Bible says he forgave
[46:50] you.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; He forgave you. How did he do it? He
[46:53] nailed it to the cross.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:57] And in the Eastern custom for their name
[46:59] to be written off, it had to be struck
[47:01] off.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, somebody had to take
[47:04] something to write through it or they
[47:06] took a nail and nailed it through the
[47:08] name.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, church, we Gentiles, we were bound
[47:15] with a sin debt that we couldn't pay.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; We were headed to a devil's hell and a
[47:21] sinner's grave. But Jesus stepped in.
[47:26] Come on. What did it? He took your sins
[47:28] upon himself and he nailed it to the
[47:31] cross.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; So you didn't have to bear it. And
[47:35] tonight you don't have to bear it. You
[47:37] don't have to bear the memory of it. You
[47:39] don't have to bury or or or carry the
[47:41] scar of it. You don't have to carry any
[47:43] a part of it because it's been nailed.
[47:46] It's been struck off. It's been
[47:47] obliterated.
[47:50] All the handwriting, all the ordinance,
[47:52] every accusation, every charge against
[47:55] you. He said, "I dropped the charges
[47:57] tonight.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; I took the charges on myself and I
[48:00] nailed it to my cross.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; You had he quickened."
[48:08] &gt;&gt; So, how did he nail it to the cross? By
[48:11] his son. By the death. By the blood of
[48:14] the lamb. And by doing that, he quickens
[48:17] you.
[48:19] strikes that accusation against you off
[48:22] and makes you alive in Christ.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Notice here, you had he quickened. What
[48:30] did he do? He destroyed your past.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; That's all you get out of that.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; He destroyed your past. You got, oh
[48:37] yeah, praise God. Oh, come on.
[48:41] Maybe you wonder why I shout so much.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Cuz I got a bad past.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; And I ain't saying you got to be like
[48:48] me. You shout as much as you want to,
[48:49] but let me just tell you, if you just
[48:50] can remember, if you can just remind
[48:53] your Satan's done enough to remind you,
[48:55] but think about the grace of God to
[48:57] stepped in
[48:58] &gt;&gt; and blotted out everything against you.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Some of you were going the wrong way.
[49:03] Some of you young people within even the
[49:05] last year were going the wrong way. But
[49:07] God stepped in,
[49:10] &gt;&gt; turned your life around. Some of you
[49:12] hoes, God stepped in and completely
[49:14] turned your families around.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God doesn't make mistakes.
[49:19] God is here to do what? To obliterate
[49:22] every ordinance, everything against you.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; He paid the debt. He obliterated the
[49:30] ordinances against us by nailing them to
[49:32] the cross. And today, notice, we are
[49:34] guiltless. Hear the words.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; You are guiltless.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; You are sinless.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; You are free. Come on, somebody. Enjoy
[49:44] your freedom tonight. You are free
[49:46] tonight. There are no binding agreements
[49:49] against you. There are no charges
[49:51] against you tonight. You have he
[49:53] quickened.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; What sin?
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Ask yourself, what sin? Oh, brother Joe,
[50:02] I woke up this morning. That's all I
[50:04] see.
[50:06] Well, can I tell you? You're looking
[50:07] through the wrong set of eyes.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz when you look at yourself, you see,
[50:12] oh, poor old me. I make mistakes. I
[50:16] shouldn't have said that. I shouldn't
[50:17] have acted that way.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Come on. Am I alone tonight?
[50:22] &gt;&gt; No. But when he looks at you, he looks
[50:23] at you through the blood of his son. And
[50:25] red through red is white.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Let me just share what the prophet of
[50:29] God said about it. He said the Holy
[50:31] Ghost will always point to the word. If
[50:33] it points to a creed or denomination, it
[50:36] is not the Holy Ghost. He couldn't do
[50:38] that. Point away from the word when he
[50:40] died to confirm that word and make that
[50:42] word positive. And I want you to know
[50:44] evening light tabernacle that the word
[50:46] is as much positive tonight in 2025 as
[50:50] it was on the day he went to the cross.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; He is the quickening life that makes
[50:57] that word live again.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; He is not a man, not a thought, not an
[51:04] idea, but he is the quickly life that
[51:07] makes that word live again. That was his
[51:09] purpose of dying. that he could still
[51:12] project himself through his church.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Why did he send a message? So that he
[51:18] could project himself in a body.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; See, he is the dynamics of the
[51:25] mechanics, the mechanics of the church.
[51:26] What is it? Apostles, prophets,
[51:28] preachers, teachers. He said he is the
[51:30] dynamics that works that. He said he is
[51:32] the fire that fires off the gas. He is
[51:35] the fire that's in the combustion
[51:36] chamber. Notice the gas, the word is
[51:39] poured over the combustion chamber. He's
[51:41] the one that sets her a fire. He's the
[51:44] one that confirms it. He's the power of
[51:46] the resurrection. He is God. He He is
[51:49] the fire. That's what he is.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't like all that fire.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; But he is fire.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; You better take that up with him.
[52:02] See, the Bible tells us in 1 Peter 4 and
[52:04] verse one, "For so much then as Christ
[52:06] has suffered for us in the flesh, arm
[52:09] yourselves likewise with the same mind.
[52:11] For he that has suffered in the flesh
[52:14] has ceased, excuse me, from sin, that he
[52:18] no longer should live the rest of his
[52:19] time in the flesh to the lust of We're
[52:23] going to pick this up here.
[52:35] that he should no longer live the rest
[52:37] of his life in the flesh to the lust of
[52:40] men, but to the will of God. Remember
[52:43] the word will. Now, remember we spoke on
[52:45] that on Sunday. It's the purpose. It's
[52:47] the desire or it's the pleasure of God.
[52:49] Then we find in Romans 8, we know that
[52:52] all things work together for good to
[52:54] them that love God, to them who are
[52:56] called according to his purpose, for
[52:58] whom he did forno.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Notice those that were in his thinking,
[53:04] those that he forneew.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; He also did predestinate to be conformed
[53:09] to the image of his son, that he might
[53:12] be the firstborn among many brethren.
[53:14] Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them
[53:16] he also called. And to whom he called,
[53:19] he also justified. Whom he justified
[53:21] them, he also glorified. So we find
[53:24] again predestination looks back to
[53:26] fornowledge. But fornowledge looks to
[53:29] your destiny. God knows the seed that he
[53:31] placed in you. God knew the right place
[53:34] to put you. He knew the right age to put
[53:36] you in. He knew the right church to set
[53:38] you in. He knew the right family to
[53:40] place you in. God knows all this. And
[53:42] that's why you're here tonight. an even
[53:44] like tabernacle is so that that seed
[53:46] that predestined seging of God can be
[53:49] quickened by the word.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Romans 8 and verse 12.
[54:03] Therefore, brother Oh, man. These T-Rex
[54:05] arms.
[54:18] Sorry about that.
[54:20] I ain't complaining.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Long as I can hold a mic, we can preach.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; But we find here in Romans 8:12,
[54:30] therefore, brethren, we are debtors not
[54:33] to the flesh.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; To live after the flesh. For if we live
[54:38] after the flesh, we shall die. But if
[54:40] you through the spirit do mortify the
[54:42] deeds of the body, you shall live. For
[54:44] as many are led by the spirit of God,
[54:46] they are the sons of God.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; And see, that's what the the theme of
[54:51] our preaching is to get you to realize,
[54:53] I am a son of God. I am a daughter of
[54:56] God. What we're telling you, you are the
[54:58] offspring of an eternal being tonight.
[55:01] You always was in God's thinking.
[55:03] Therefore, you always will be in God's
[55:05] thinking.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; You didn't just happen. You didn't just
[55:08] exist. You your parents didn't make a
[55:10] mistake. God predestinated you to be
[55:13] here.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; You have not received a spirit of
[55:19] bondage again to fear.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; I mean, what's the point of coming out
[55:24] of the world if you're going to still
[55:25] live a Christian life in fear?
[55:29] &gt;&gt; But you have received the spirit of
[55:30] adoption
[55:33] whereby we cry, "Aba, Father. Oh my
[55:36] father, my father.
[55:39] See, the spirit itself,
[55:41] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[55:45] our spirit
[55:47] &gt;&gt; that we are his children.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; And notice the next verse. And if
[55:52] children, then we're hes
[55:55] of God and joint hes with Christ. If so
[55:57] be that we suffer with him that we may
[56:00] also be glorified together.
[56:05] You know, you hear people they people
[56:07] that receive an inheritance.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; I don't have any rich relatives.
[56:17] I don't really understand all of this,
[56:19] but I'm just taking everybody else's
[56:21] example that has rich relatives.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, one day, Uncle
[56:26] Johnny's, no offense, it just slipped
[56:30] out. So, we're going to go with it.
[56:32] Rich, let's go. Let's go ahead and add
[56:34] adjectize it a little bit. That's not
[56:37] even a word, is it?
[56:40] I'm preaching. We're going to work with
[56:41] it tonight. Put that in Webster's
[56:42] dictionary. Agitize.
[56:45] Rich Uncle Johnny. Rich, goodlooking,
[56:49] swole Uncle Johnny.
[56:53] But Uncle Johnny passes away and he
[56:55] ain't he don't have any sons. He don't
[56:57] have any daughters. But what he has is
[56:59] nephew Joe.
[57:03] And there came a time that Uncle
[57:05] Johnny's will.
[57:07] It was time for the reading of the will.
[57:10] And guess who showed up? Cousin Joe or
[57:12] nephew Joe showed up for the reading of
[57:14] the wheel. I didn't know if I had
[57:17] anything in there. But when the wheel
[57:19] became open, when it the book became
[57:21] open and they began to read all that
[57:24] Uncle Johnny left to this one and to
[57:26] that one, I wasn't worried about who got
[57:28] this and who got that. I was only
[57:30] worried is my name in the wheel. And I
[57:33] want you to know tonight, Uncle Johnny
[57:35] put your name in the wheel tonight. It's
[57:38] in the lamb's book of life before the
[57:40] foundation of the world.
[57:44] I went into that will reading with
[57:47] nothing. But I came out of there.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; I came out with riches. I came out with
[57:52] everything Uncle Johnny possessed. And
[57:54] he said, "I made you a joint air with
[57:56] Christ.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; You came into this world with nothing.
[57:59] But he yokeked you with Jesus Christ."
[58:01] And all of eternity belongs to you
[58:03] tonight.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Because somebody read the wheel.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Man, I walked out of that wheel reading.
[58:14] I didn't drag out. Man, I'm thinking I
[58:16] about to go buy something.
[58:20] I got money. I ain't never had money
[58:23] like this. Our father is rich with
[58:27] houses and lands.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; He owns the world. Oh my.
[58:33] Oh, you know the song Silver and Gold.
[58:35] We have riches untold.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; A cattle on a thousand heels. Come on.
[58:42] Recognize.
[58:44] recognize he's quickening this word to
[58:46] you
[58:47] &gt;&gt; to make you a part of it.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; If he didn't think about you, if Uncle
[58:54] Johnny didn't love little nephew Joe, he
[58:57] would have never wrote my name down.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; But he thought of you.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; He thought of you before you came to the
[59:05] altar. He thought of you before you made
[59:07] your first mistake. He thought of you
[59:09] and he put your name on the lamb's book
[59:11] of life before the foundation of the
[59:13] world. And all we ready to do, church,
[59:15] is read the will. Read the purpose of
[59:18] God. What is his purpose? To quicken
[59:20] that seed, to quicken that life. To call
[59:23] sons and daughters to himself.
[59:29] But many times we look at ourselves.
[59:32] We look through the veil of this
[59:34] humanity
[59:37] and we got mistakes. We don't measure
[59:39] up. Satan's there to remind us of our
[59:41] failures, our shortcomings. Well, you
[59:43] shouldn't have said this. Well, duh.
[59:48] Or you shouldn't have acted that way. I
[59:49] know. I'm not a dummy.
[59:53] And we just constantly berate oursel.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to preach to the wall cuz
[59:58] I me and the wall have an understanding.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; You know the way that I take you, right?
[1:00:04] Sometimes it's not the right way.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; But we have to come back to the word of
[1:00:08] God. That's right.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; How many times we're reminded of our
[1:00:12] mistakes? Satan is there to constantly
[1:00:14] remind you you're a sinner. You failed
[1:00:17] here. You failed there. You did this
[1:00:19] here. You did that there.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; But no matter how you see yourself, if
[1:00:24] you can only see yourself through the
[1:00:26] eyes that he sees, you
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; see, he sees the thought that he had of
[1:00:31] you before the foundation of the world.
[1:00:33] Amen.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that once those sins
[1:00:36] that we have that they're confessed into
[1:00:38] the blood of Jesus Christ, God don't
[1:00:41] even see them, nor does he know anything
[1:00:43] about it.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; The God that we serve, church, is so
[1:00:47] big. He's omniresent, omnisient, all
[1:00:50] knowing. But when you confess your sins
[1:00:53] into that blood, he don't even know what
[1:00:56] you're talking about.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; That's a God. You remember, you're
[1:01:02] reminded and it comes up every day and
[1:01:04] you look at this or you hear a song or
[1:01:06] you you smell a fragrance, it reminds
[1:01:08] you of something that you shouldn't have
[1:01:10] done, but to God, he don't know nothing
[1:01:12] about it.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "He, the bridegroom, took away
[1:01:19] your shame." Oh, hallelujah.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Took away your shame, put it in the sea
[1:01:24] of forgiveness by the washing of the
[1:01:26] water of the word and the blood of life.
[1:01:29] your first husband that you were married
[1:01:31] to the world, the anointed bridegroom
[1:01:33] which for ordained you has washed you by
[1:01:35] the washing of the water. The church now
[1:01:37] listen, he says that don't sound right.
[1:01:40] You might not find that in an almanac,
[1:01:41] but not in God's Bible. By the washing
[1:01:44] of the water of the word in the word,
[1:01:47] not the church.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Well, I belong to even like tabernacle,
[1:01:51] not the church. I go to Tim Pruis
[1:01:54] church. He's my pastor. Not the church.
[1:01:56] You got to be washed by the washing of
[1:01:58] the water of the word.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; And not just this word, but the anointed
[1:02:04] word for this hour.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Notice what he says in invisible union.
[1:02:10] And I was getting to this on Sunday. You
[1:02:14] are standing completely justified as
[1:02:16] though you never did it in the
[1:02:18] beginning. This is my message to the
[1:02:21] church now. You're standing complete,
[1:02:23] justified like you never did it in the
[1:02:26] first place.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, some of y'all need to hear that.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; You never did it in the first place.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Where?
[1:02:36] When I was five, when I was four, when
[1:02:39] this happened to me, when that happened
[1:02:40] to me, when I was 13 and 14, or when I
[1:02:43] got married, or when I when I went to
[1:02:45] that bar? No. The first place
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; was in God's thinking.
[1:02:52] See, and God's thinking you're perfect.
[1:02:54] And God's thinking you're pure. And
[1:02:56] God's thinking you're sinless. And God's
[1:02:58] thinking you're free. This is what a
[1:03:00] pro. This is a prophet.
[1:03:02] He's coming down. Now, remember, I I
[1:03:04] told you this past Sunday that he tapped
[1:03:06] into the back part of God's mind to
[1:03:08] bring out God's purpose and will to us.
[1:03:09] But he's also telling us how God feels
[1:03:11] about you.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; And here we find he says, "You are the
[1:03:14] pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son
[1:03:17] of the living God. Every man and woman
[1:03:19] that's born are quickened of the spirit
[1:03:22] of God. Now, I put that word there. The
[1:03:23] quote doesn't have that, but just so we
[1:03:25] don't get it all sniffed on the internet
[1:03:26] and somebody sent it around the world
[1:03:28] that I added something to it. This ain't
[1:03:29] the Bible. We ain't adding to this, but
[1:03:31] we are adding to the quote here just a
[1:03:33] little bit. And he said, "Now the spirit
[1:03:35] of God washed in the blood of Jesus and
[1:03:37] believes every word of God stands as
[1:03:39] though you never sinned in the first
[1:03:42] place. You are perfect."
[1:03:46] I know you're like, "Oh, I'm shocked."
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we all shocked.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Not because you're perfect, but because
[1:03:52] we're perfect.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Notice what he goes on. You're standing
[1:03:56] completely. You never sin at the first
[1:03:58] place. God don't even know nothing. It's
[1:04:01] in the sea of forgiveness. You never did
[1:04:03] it. You were accused of it by the
[1:04:05] accuser. But really, from the beginning,
[1:04:07] you were the predestinated to be a son
[1:04:10] and daughter of God. And you're standing
[1:04:12] there washed. Your old book of
[1:04:14] divorcement is put away and it's dead.
[1:04:16] Absolutely out of existence.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. Everything, brother Joe, that I
[1:04:22] ever done, everything that you ever done
[1:04:24] is out of existence tonight. Not even in
[1:04:27] the mind of God.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Not even God don't even know about it.
[1:04:34] That's right.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; And he says, "We're hes
[1:04:41] of God, joint hes with Christ. If so be
[1:04:43] that we suffer with him, that we also
[1:04:45] may be glorified together." So an heir
[1:04:47] is a person legally entitled
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; to property. Thank you, Uncle Johnny.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; I'm legally entitled
[1:04:59] because I'm a part
[1:05:02] of my father.
[1:05:04] So don't get mad at me if I pass off the
[1:05:07] scene and I leave my kids an
[1:05:09] inheritance.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; They're my kids.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Nor should you get mad if God choose to
[1:05:17] bless somebody else in your church.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; They're an heir.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Rejoice with them.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Say hallelujah. Bless God. He's still in
[1:05:27] the blessing business tonight.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; And somebody needs to recognize it's
[1:05:30] your season. You've gone through the
[1:05:32] winters. You've gone through the falls.
[1:05:34] You've gone through those hard times.
[1:05:36] But now it's your season to be blessed
[1:05:38] by the word, to be quickened by the
[1:05:40] spirit of God. It's your season to rise
[1:05:42] up from that calamity and be that son
[1:05:45] and that daughter that God always chose
[1:05:47] you to be.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Listen what brother Bam says here. God
[1:05:51] can no more deny you than he can deny
[1:05:53] himself.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody get nasty with the
[1:05:59] devil tonight. God can't deny you
[1:06:00] tonight
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; cuz he can't deny himself.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I feel like preaching
[1:06:07] tonight. Woo.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; When you say, "Oh, brother Joe, the
[1:06:11] devil got me." Listen what your prophet
[1:06:12] said about that. He says, "For you are
[1:06:14] dead and your life is hid with Christ in
[1:06:17] God."
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; You are dead.
[1:06:21] Dead people don't argue.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna say that again.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Dead people don't argue.
[1:06:29] Dead people don't criticize
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; dead people they do sleep
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; right in church dead people they don't
[1:06:41] argue they don't criticize they don't
[1:06:43] complain they don't fuss they don't
[1:06:45] backbite dead people don't there ain't
[1:06:47] no life in a dead person
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; he said and you were dead
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand Paul's teaching
[1:06:56] here Paul is not saying yet you're still
[1:06:58] dead. Paul is constantly saying were
[1:07:00] past tense, past tense, past tense.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; But your life is hid, concealed, kept
[1:07:07] secret in God through Christ or with
[1:07:11] Christ in God. You say, "Brother
[1:07:14] Brandom, the devil got me." No,
[1:07:18] the devil didn't. You went out to the
[1:07:20] devil. That's right.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; You see young people, they know they
[1:07:22] they come up and they make a move or
[1:07:24] people make a move and they constantly
[1:07:25] make a move and they go back and the
[1:07:27] devil got me.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Said, "No, you went out to the devil.
[1:07:30] The devil can't get you for you are
[1:07:33] dead."
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; What is he saying? That this humanity is
[1:07:36] dead to the things of the world.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Dead people won't argue and fuss and
[1:07:42] backbite. You're dead and your life is
[1:07:44] hidden God through Christ and you're
[1:07:46] sealed there by the Holy Ghost. How can
[1:07:49] the devil get you
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; if you're hid in God through Christ? How
[1:07:54] can the devil get you? Quit blaming God
[1:07:57] for your mistakes. Quit blaming the
[1:07:59] devil when you keep going out to him.
[1:08:01] It's time that you die to this humanity
[1:08:04] and be quickened.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Made a lie by the power of God.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; See, the devil can't get you as long as
[1:08:12] you're in Christ. You're sheltered by
[1:08:14] the blood. The blood hides you. It
[1:08:16] conceals you. Psalms 32:7 it says, "Thou
[1:08:19] art my hiding place. Thou shalt preserve
[1:08:22] me from trouble. Thou shalt compass me
[1:08:24] about with songs of deliverance." In
[1:08:27] Psalms 119 and verse 14, "Thou art my
[1:08:30] hiding place, my shield. I hope in thy
[1:08:34] word." So a hiding place is a shelter.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; It's where the enemy can't get. It's a
[1:08:41] city of refuge that the avenger of blood
[1:08:44] has no access.
[1:08:46] He can only pierce over the wall.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; He can only peep through the hole of the
[1:08:53] door, but he is not granted access
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; because you're in a city of refuge. And
[1:08:59] Christ is our hiding place. He is our
[1:09:02] refuge. How do you get in there? The
[1:09:04] Bible tells us by one spirit. He says,
[1:09:06] not by one letter are we joined into
[1:09:09] that body. Not by one denomination are
[1:09:11] we brought into that body, but by one
[1:09:13] spirit are we baptized by the Holy
[1:09:16] Spirit baptism into that body.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to turn a corner here.
[1:09:24] Leviticus 23 and verse 9. We're going to
[1:09:26] we're going to turn a corner. We're
[1:09:28] going to come back. We're going to try
[1:09:29] to crash land this thing in about 35
[1:09:32] minutes.
[1:09:34] Y'all don't hold me to that.
[1:09:37] That's just wishful thinking.
[1:09:39] But he says now, "And the Lord spake
[1:09:41] unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the
[1:09:43] children of Israel, and say unto them,
[1:09:46] when you have come into the land which I
[1:09:48] give unto you, that you shall reap the
[1:09:50] harvest thereof, then you shall bring a
[1:09:53] sheep of the first fruits of your
[1:09:55] harvest unto the priest, and he shall
[1:09:57] wave the sheep before the Lord to be
[1:10:00] accepted for you on the tomorrow after
[1:10:02] the Sabbath the priest shall wave it."
[1:10:04] So the land that they were given was a
[1:10:06] natural land
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; is a land that flowed with milk and
[1:10:10] honey. And milk and honey was the diet
[1:10:12] of kings. So God had already
[1:10:14] pre-ordained pre pre-planned
[1:10:18] their land.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; He knew exactly where to place him. He
[1:10:22] could have put them anywhere in the not
[1:10:24] the United States, but he could have put
[1:10:26] them there too. But he could have put
[1:10:26] them anywhere in the world. And he
[1:10:28] carved out a little bitty land called
[1:10:30] Israel.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; And he said, "This is your land. I have
[1:10:34] predetermined you to stay in this land.
[1:10:37] It's a great land. It's a land that
[1:10:38] flows with milk and honey. And he says,
[1:10:40] when you get into that land and you grow
[1:10:43] your harvest, I want you to pull the
[1:10:45] very first ones from that harvest, take
[1:10:47] it to the high priest, and let them wave
[1:10:49] it as a a wave offering or a sheep
[1:10:52] offering. What was it representing? That
[1:10:54] there was going to be more to come out
[1:10:56] of that harvest. And what has God done
[1:10:58] in this day? He's given you and I as the
[1:11:00] believer, we're coming into our
[1:11:02] homeland, our promised land. It ain't
[1:11:04] the land of denominations. It's the land
[1:11:06] of the opening of the word where all the
[1:11:08] miracles are there. All the Holy Ghost
[1:11:10] is there. All the healing is there.
[1:11:12] Everything that we have need of is in
[1:11:14] that land.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; But take it to the priest.
[1:11:20] Take it to the prophet.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, let him open it up. Take it to him.
[1:11:27] Let him wave it. Notice, not on the
[1:11:30] Sabbath,
[1:11:31] but on the day after the Sabbath, which
[1:11:34] is the Sunday,
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; the su n day. And brother Rab says it's
[1:11:39] no longer the su n day. It's a dual sun
[1:11:42] rising. It's the s o n day.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, he says just in the beginning in
[1:11:48] Genesis there when the s so o n rose and
[1:11:50] it brought botney life. Everything that
[1:11:52] ever lived had to live by that life. He
[1:11:54] says the same way for us. We don't live
[1:11:56] here without the s in life rising again.
[1:11:59] Church, I'm here to tell you, it's the
[1:12:00] rising of the sun. He has risen in this
[1:12:03] hour. He has come in this age to to
[1:12:06] quicken a bride to quicken up people to
[1:12:08] have eternal life.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; But a wave offering, a sheath offering,
[1:12:15] what was he doing? But notice, brother B
[1:12:18] would tell us not only the su n rising,
[1:12:21] it's the s o n rising to bring eternal
[1:12:23] life to all of God's promised seed that
[1:12:26] by fornowledge he had seen laying upon
[1:12:29] the earth.
[1:12:31] Said he waved over the promised seed
[1:12:34] that had promise of life,
[1:12:38] not just any seed. So the sun rose,
[1:12:41] brother Timothy, and we know how it is
[1:12:43] in Louisiana. It gets hot. It gets nasty
[1:12:47] hot. But that sun doesn't ride to
[1:12:50] quicken the dirt.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; That sun doesn't rise to quicken the
[1:12:56] rocks. But the sun rises to quicken the
[1:12:59] seed. And the rocks will cry, "Oh, this
[1:13:02] is too hot. This is too I'm leaving
[1:13:04] Louisiana."
[1:13:06] The dirt will cry, "Oh, I'm so sick of
[1:13:09] this humidity. My goodness, I hate
[1:13:11] Louisiana."
[1:13:13] But that predestinated seed said,
[1:13:15] "That's just what I'm looking for. I
[1:13:17] need the word. I need the sun. I need
[1:13:19] the ministry. I need it. I don't care if
[1:13:22] it's the only thing in Louisiana. Let me
[1:13:24] have more of it. It's the rising of the
[1:13:27] sun to quicken that predestinated seed."
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; And some of you moved in here just so
[1:13:35] that seed can be quickened.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; It wasn't that you wasn't in good
[1:13:40] ground.
[1:13:42] But you wasn't in where he wanted you to
[1:13:44] blossom.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; But notice, I love what he says here.
[1:13:51] Ephesians 1 and verse three. Blessed be
[1:13:54] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:13:57] Christ, who had blessed us with all
[1:13:58] spiritual blessings in heavenly places,
[1:14:01] according as he has chosen us in him
[1:14:04] before the foundation of the world, that
[1:14:06] we should be holy without blame before
[1:14:07] him in love. So God, it's God's
[1:14:10] choosing.
[1:14:11] So don't get upset.
[1:14:14] God chooses
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; and God gives who he wants.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; See, God picks out. God chooses. God
[1:14:22] doesn't choose. Brother Timothy, like
[1:14:23] man chooses. I've told y'all my story in
[1:14:26] my kickball years. Little fat roly
[1:14:29] pololy. Little kickball Joe don't get
[1:14:32] picked first.
[1:14:34] They don't pick fat slow people.
[1:14:37] I'm not picking on fat slow people
[1:14:39] tonight. But you don't get picked first
[1:14:41] in a kickball game. Or remember y'all
[1:14:45] y'all ever played dodgeball?
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you got to move quick.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Look, I'm here to tell you, I wasn't the
[1:14:51] fastest thing on the block, but I nailed
[1:14:54] a few guys in my day.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; But I was picked last. But God don't
[1:14:58] choose us the way we choose us.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; See, we look at tall, dark, and
[1:15:03] handsome.
[1:15:05] Not everybody can be brother Johnny.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Goodlook man. Tall, dark, and handsome.
[1:15:11] Some of us are short, balding. Come on,
[1:15:14] Brother Tom. Give me an amen.
[1:15:17] Cute. Oh, yeah. We'll throw that on in
[1:15:18] there.
[1:15:20] But see, you put me and Brother Johnny
[1:15:23] together, y'all going to choose him.
[1:15:24] He's bowed up. He's big and bad. And
[1:15:26] hey, I'm choosing him over me myself.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; But see, God don't choose that way.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; See, God looks at the heart of a man.
[1:15:35] He's looking for that predestinated seed
[1:15:38] that he placed there. Is that the one?
[1:15:40] And if it is, he's going to quicken it.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; If it ain't the one, he's going to move
[1:15:44] on by,
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; but he's going to quicken. And the Bible
[1:15:47] says, "All that the father has given me
[1:15:49] shall come, and I will in no wise lose
[1:15:52] one."
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; So don't worry. God ain't losing.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Notice, man, we look on our outward
[1:15:59] stature. How tall, how strong, how
[1:16:01] smart, how good-looking. But God looks
[1:16:03] on the heart. And before there was a
[1:16:05] world, you were in God's stalls to give
[1:16:07] you the Holy Ghost because he knew that
[1:16:10] you would be wanting it. I say, "Thanks
[1:16:12] be to God today. That's why I'm here.
[1:16:14] That's why I'm in Louisiana. That's why
[1:16:16] I'm part of Elite Tabernacle. Because I
[1:16:18] want the Holy Ghost. I want the
[1:16:20] quickening power. I want the anointed
[1:16:22] word. I want everything that God has for
[1:16:24] me. If it means I got to come to this
[1:16:26] place, I'm going to stay here and get
[1:16:28] everything that God has predestinated
[1:16:31] for me to have.
[1:16:34] And God doesn't choose you to lose you.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to write that down.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; That popped in my head today. I said,
[1:16:42] "That's for somebody."
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; God don't choose you to lose you.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; He don't quicken you, make you alive
[1:16:51] only to let you die. That's right.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; In John 15 and verse 16,
[1:16:58] he said, "You have not chosen me,
[1:17:01] but I have chosen you and ordained you
[1:17:05] that you should go forth and bring forth
[1:17:07] fruit and that your fruit should remain
[1:17:10] that whatsoever you ask the father in my
[1:17:13] name that he may give it." So God
[1:17:14] doesn't choose us to lose us and we
[1:17:16] don't choose him.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; It's all God's doing.
[1:17:20] Therefore, no man can get all puffed up
[1:17:24] and say, "I did this."
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; No man can say, "This is my ministry.
[1:17:29] Look at me and my gift and my min." It's
[1:17:31] not yours.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; It's God's.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; And God placed it there.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Brother saying Jehovah Gyro number one,
[1:17:38] he says, "So you're He goes, you're
[1:17:41] chosen
[1:17:44] chosen at all."
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; But what about my past? I don't care
[1:17:47] about your past. You were chosen before
[1:17:49] the foundation of the world or you
[1:17:51] wasn't chosen at all.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; So why are you here?
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; I want you to ask yourself that
[1:18:00] question. Why am I here? Not just at
[1:18:02] evening like tabernacle, but why are you
[1:18:05] here? Why are you in this hour? Why are
[1:18:07] you in this age? Why are you in
[1:18:08] Louisiana? Why are you here?
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Because God chose you to be here.
[1:18:14] Therefore, that means that God has
[1:18:16] something for you. Not just to live in
[1:18:18] your past, not just to live in defeat,
[1:18:20] not just to live in your failures, but
[1:18:22] God chose you to quicken you and make
[1:18:24] you alive by the word.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; He chose you before the foundation of
[1:18:32] the world or you wasn't chosen at all.
[1:18:35] And he just come to redeem that name.
[1:18:38] All those names that are that are not on
[1:18:40] the lamb's book of life. He says, "But
[1:18:42] before the foundation world is the only
[1:18:44] ones, I think he meant to say all those
[1:18:47] names who are on the lamb's book of life
[1:18:48] before the foundation world are the only
[1:18:50] ones that's going to be there." Anyhow,
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; only those question answers 1959. You'll
[1:18:58] love this.
[1:19:00] He says, "Isn't it wonderful that he
[1:19:02] loved you?"
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; He loved you. He loved you before there
[1:19:09] was a world.
[1:19:13] He knows your nature, Justin.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; He knew all about it. He knows your
[1:19:18] weaknesses, David. There's probably a
[1:19:21] few of them. He knows your habits,
[1:19:24] Joseph.
[1:19:26] Notice, he knowed all about you, what
[1:19:29] you was going to be. And then when he
[1:19:32] looked over all the great universe as it
[1:19:35] was,
[1:19:36] he says, "I choose you.
[1:19:40] I choose you.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; He could have chose the morally perfect.
[1:19:44] He could have chose the high and mighty,
[1:19:46] the wise and prudent. But he looked at
[1:19:49] your weaknesses. He looked at your
[1:19:51] failures. He looked at your past or the
[1:19:55] things that you would do. And he says,
[1:19:56] "I choose you anyway.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; I choose you despite your past."
[1:20:03] Oh, when you receive the Holy Ghost,
[1:20:05] then you become eternal because you're
[1:20:07] with God. You're part of God. You can
[1:20:09] see what I mean. See, you're as eternal
[1:20:11] as God is because you are. And then he
[1:20:14] tells us here in 1 John 5 and verse 10,
[1:20:17] he says, "He that believeth on me or on
[1:20:19] the Son of God hath the witness in
[1:20:21] himself. He that believeth not God had
[1:20:23] made him out a liar because he believeth
[1:20:25] not the record that God give his son."
[1:20:27] And this is the record that God has
[1:20:30] given us eternal life. And this life is
[1:20:32] in the Son. And he that hath the son
[1:20:34] hath life. And he that hath not the son
[1:20:37] hath not life. And in the church age,
[1:20:40] brother B tells us this is the record.
[1:20:42] God has given us eternal life. And the
[1:20:44] life is in his son. He that hath the son
[1:20:46] hath life eternal. He that hath not the
[1:20:49] son hath not life eternal. And those who
[1:20:52] that are he says and those who had that
[1:20:54] life were in him before the foundation
[1:20:56] of the world. They were the chosen in
[1:20:59] before the foundation of the world. The
[1:21:01] great royal seed Jesus Christ was
[1:21:04] planted. He died and that that life that
[1:21:06] was in him came up through the wheat
[1:21:08] plant and is reproducing itself in a
[1:21:11] multitude of other wheat seeds
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; having the same life in them. So all
[1:21:19] that the father has given us or given
[1:21:23] him will come. And the Bible tells us in
[1:21:25] revelations 3 and verse 5, he that
[1:21:28] overcomemeth the same shall be clothed
[1:21:30] in white raignnt.
[1:21:33] And I will not blot his name out of the
[1:21:36] book of life, but I will confess his
[1:21:38] name before my father and his holy
[1:21:40] angels.
[1:21:42] So he will blot out the handwritings
[1:21:47] and the ordinance against you, but he
[1:21:48] will not blot your name out of that
[1:21:50] book.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; But he will blot out all the accusations
[1:21:54] against you.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; See, what a God we serve.
[1:21:59] all the charges,
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; all the sins, all the mistakes, all the
[1:22:04] ordinances, all the binding agreements
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; that you put your hand to, he blotss it
[1:22:12] out. But he will not blot your name out
[1:22:15] of that book to him that overcomemeth.
[1:22:18] And he says, "And I will confess his
[1:22:20] name before my father and for his
[1:22:22] angels." That word confess there means
[1:22:23] he will celebrate. So God's not ashamed
[1:22:26] of you.
[1:22:28] He's not ashamed of your past. He's not
[1:22:30] ashamed to call you son. He's not
[1:22:32] ashamed to call you redeemed. He's not
[1:22:34] ashamed to call you his child. See all
[1:22:37] those that he's chosen. God's not
[1:22:39] ashamed of that seed. He's not ashamed
[1:22:41] of the chosen. He's not ashamed of those
[1:22:43] that are elected. That's why he come is
[1:22:45] to quicken that and raise up a bride in
[1:22:48] the midst of Satan's Eden. Amen.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; He will openly and joyfully celebrate
[1:22:55] your name
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; in front of your enemy.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Somebody need to get your dancing
[1:23:02] shoes on.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Polish them up a little bit.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; He will openly and joyfully confess your
[1:23:10] name before your enemy. Amen.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us here in
[1:23:15] Revelations 20:15, look what it says
[1:23:18] about those whose names are not written
[1:23:19] in the book of life. And whoever was not
[1:23:22] found written in the book of life was
[1:23:24] cast into the lake of fire.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; So not everybody has their name pinned
[1:23:29] in this book.
[1:23:32] And then Jesus tells them in Luke 10 and
[1:23:35] verse 19, he says, "Behold, I give you
[1:23:37] power to dread on serpents and scorpions
[1:23:40] and over all the power of the enemy. And
[1:23:42] nothing shall by any means hurt you. Not
[1:23:45] withstanding in this. Rejoice not that
[1:23:47] the spirits are subject unto you, but
[1:23:49] rather rejoice because your names are
[1:23:52] written in heaven."
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Don't rejoice because you can do this
[1:23:55] and you can do that. Oh, I've done this
[1:23:57] and I've done this in your name. He
[1:23:59] says, don't rejoice in those things.
[1:24:00] Don't rejoice that you can do all the
[1:24:02] supernatural and you got speaking in
[1:24:04] tongues and healing and all that, but
[1:24:06] rejoice because your name is written in
[1:24:07] the lamb's book of life. And if your
[1:24:09] name was written inside that book, there
[1:24:11] ain't enough devils in hell that can
[1:24:13] take your name off of that book. There
[1:24:15] ain't enough trials, ain't enough past,
[1:24:17] ain't enough mistakes that can ever blot
[1:24:19] your name off of it. But almighty God
[1:24:21] has pinned your name there with the
[1:24:23] indelible ink of the blood of Jesus
[1:24:25] Christ. And nothing can take it off.
[1:24:34] He said he was waved.
[1:24:37] He was waved at the day of Pentecost
[1:24:39] when there came a sound from heaven like
[1:24:41] a wave, like a wave in mighty rushing
[1:24:44] wind. He was waved over the people, the
[1:24:46] Pentecostal people that was up there at
[1:24:48] Pentecost waiting for the blessing to
[1:24:50] come and notice and to be waved again.
[1:24:54] We realize in the last day according to
[1:24:56] Luke 17:30 in the son of in the in the
[1:25:00] sun day again in the day that the sen
[1:25:02] man will be revealed are waved again he
[1:25:05] said the word lith for this day
[1:25:07] fulfilling this promise when the son of
[1:25:09] man shall be revealed the days of Sodom
[1:25:11] all these things promised here it is the
[1:25:13] word of God being revealed it's the word
[1:25:16] itself discerning the thoughts and
[1:25:18] intents of the heart what is it it's the
[1:25:20] word of God what we've seen in this hour
[1:25:22] was the waving of that sheath
[1:25:25] that there was one that went into that
[1:25:27] land of the Holy Ghost, that land of the
[1:25:29] token promise where the indwelling, the
[1:25:32] presence, the person of Jesus Christ
[1:25:34] himself came and tabernacled one. What
[1:25:37] was it saying? There's going to be more
[1:25:39] that receive that message and they're
[1:25:41] going to produce the very same life.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; It ain't just for one man ministry. It
[1:25:46] ain't just for the preachers. It ain't
[1:25:48] just for the deacons. It's for whosoever
[1:25:50] will. I'm waving the word, the opening
[1:25:53] of the word over the people, over that
[1:25:55] predestinated seed that was
[1:25:57] predestinated for life.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; That's why the message came is to
[1:26:04] quicken.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; You hath he quickened.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; He's declaring
[1:26:13] that there's more coming.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Look around. There's empty seats,
[1:26:20] but there's more coming.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Why couldn't he come in Paul's day?
[1:26:25] Because your name was in the book.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Why couldn't he come at year 2000 when
[1:26:31] we thought, "Oh, Y 2K, it's all going to
[1:26:33] end." Because some of your names were in
[1:26:35] the book.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Every name in that book will be
[1:26:42] quickened. That's right.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Let me start bringing this down. My my
[1:26:48] my This is should have preached this on
[1:26:51] Sunday.
[1:26:54] Y'all ain't got to agree with me so
[1:26:55] loud.
[1:26:58] He said Christ was the first one to rise
[1:27:01] or to raise from all the prophets and so
[1:27:03] forth. Although typed in many places, he
[1:27:05] was the first fruits of those that slept
[1:27:07] in the bride coming of Christ coming out
[1:27:10] of the church. There will be a sheath
[1:27:12] waved again in the last days. The first
[1:27:14] time there came forth the bride age for
[1:27:16] the resurrection out of dark
[1:27:17] denominations will be a message that for
[1:27:20] the full maturity of the word has turned
[1:27:22] back again to full power being waved
[1:27:24] over the people by the same signs and
[1:27:27] wonders that he did back there.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; And people don't want the supernatural.
[1:27:34] People don't want the the miraculous in
[1:27:36] their church. Well, you don't want the
[1:27:38] wave sheath waving over because what he
[1:27:40] did then, he's doing it again today. And
[1:27:43] I'm not talking he is in William Brown.
[1:27:45] I'm talking about he is in Jesus Christ.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; He's the one that's being waved over the
[1:27:50] people in the supernatural.
[1:27:57] Romans 8 and verse 19, it says, "For the
[1:27:59] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:28:01] waitth for the manifestation of the sons
[1:28:04] of God." Verse 22. And we know that the
[1:28:05] whole creation groanth and travaleth in
[1:28:08] pain together until now. And not only
[1:28:10] they, but ourselves also, which had the
[1:28:12] first fruits of the spirit, even we
[1:28:14] ourselves, we grown within ourselves,
[1:28:16] waiting for the adoption to the change
[1:28:20] or the redemption of our bodies. He said
[1:28:23] the messenger of Malachi 4 will appear
[1:28:25] at God's appointed time. We are looking
[1:28:27] for him. We believe he will come. This
[1:28:29] is according to his word. It will be at
[1:28:31] the end time, which is the time now for
[1:28:33] to see it. He will be correctly
[1:28:34] dedicated to the word as they have
[1:28:36] always been dedicated or indicated by
[1:28:38] God's word and vindicated. God will
[1:28:41] vindicate what he preaches to be the
[1:28:42] truth as he did Elijah. For is Elijah
[1:28:45] coming making ready the Mount Zion
[1:28:47] rapture. So he says Jesus said in the
[1:28:49] last days it will be like it was in last
[1:28:51] time his preaching will be with the
[1:28:53] spirit and strength of the line of God's
[1:28:54] word because so much has been called
[1:28:56] God's truth. Many are misunderstanding
[1:28:58] the true messenger. But the first
[1:29:00] forerunner came from the widows and he
[1:29:02] cried, "Behold the lamb." The second
[1:29:04] forerunner will probably do the same by
[1:29:06] pointing the people to a word bride.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Notice church, this ministry, this
[1:29:13] message was never about William Brandon,
[1:29:15] but it's always been about a word bride.
[1:29:19] Get me a bride. Come on. Go Elijah and
[1:29:22] get me a bride for my my my son Isaac.
[1:29:25] Go get her a wife. Get her one. Don't
[1:29:27] just get her from anywhere, but get her
[1:29:29] from the family. Get her from one that's
[1:29:30] got representation from eternal life.
[1:29:32] Get her one that was in my thoughts
[1:29:34] before the foundation of the world. Get
[1:29:36] my son a bride.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; And he couldn't trust his plan just to
[1:29:41] anybody. So, he had to vindicate a
[1:29:42] prophet.
[1:29:47] Musicians, if you would come, I'm going
[1:29:49] to start closing down.
[1:30:04] Galatians 4.
[1:30:09] Y'all hanging on with me? You good?
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; All right. Good.
[1:30:14] Now, I say Ephesians or Galatians,
[1:30:16] excuse me, Galatians 4 and verse one.
[1:30:18] Y'all live enough. Just give me about 10
[1:30:20] minutes. We're going to parachute out.
[1:30:22] And I know I'm not brother Juel, but
[1:30:23] we're going to parachute anyway.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Now I say that the heir, how many is
[1:30:29] there?
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; I want to see a show of hands.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; All right, that's good. Y'all
[1:30:33] participation 100%. Now I say that the
[1:30:36] heir,
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; nephew Johnny, nephew Joe, has a long as
[1:30:41] he is a child differ from a servant,
[1:30:44] though he be lord of all. Notice what he
[1:30:46] says. Now the heir, as long as he is a
[1:30:48] child, he differs nothing from a
[1:30:50] servant, though he be lord of all,
[1:30:53] though he's entitled,
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; but there's got to have something,
[1:30:58] something's got to transfer.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; So he says, now buddies under tutors and
[1:31:02] governors until the time appointed of
[1:31:04] the father.
[1:31:07] For even so, when we were children, we
[1:31:08] were in bondage under the elements of
[1:31:10] the world. But when the fullness of time
[1:31:12] was come, God sent forth his son, made
[1:31:15] of a woman, made under the law, to
[1:31:17] redeem them that were under the law,
[1:31:19] that that he might or that we might
[1:31:21] receive the adoption of sons.
[1:31:25] And because you are sons, God has sent
[1:31:27] forth the spirit of his son into your
[1:31:29] hearts, crying, aba, father. Wherefore
[1:31:31] thou no more a servant, but a son? And
[1:31:34] if a son, then an heir of God through
[1:31:37] Christ.
[1:31:41] And we're going to pick this up here out
[1:31:42] of verse five. Just start playing
[1:31:44] something if you would, something soft
[1:31:46] maybe, however you feel led. But he
[1:31:48] says, notice, to redeem them that were
[1:31:50] under the law that we might receive the
[1:31:56] adoption of sons. And that phrase there,
[1:31:59] adoption of son, means it's the placing
[1:32:02] of sons.
[1:32:04] It's placing them into a position of
[1:32:06] authority. It means that your name on
[1:32:09] the check is just as good as a father's
[1:32:13] name.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; That means you can sign it without
[1:32:18] worrying about it being rejected.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Joseph and I share the same name.
[1:32:26] Joseph Marian Adams. Joseph Marian
[1:32:31] Adams. His name better never write a
[1:32:33] check in my checkbook, but his name
[1:32:38] is just as good as mine.
[1:32:43] So we find here
[1:32:46] this phrase adoption, the placing of
[1:32:48] sons.
[1:32:51] And when God quickens you with the
[1:32:52] baptism of the Holy Spirit, what is he
[1:32:55] doing? He's placing you
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; placing you into a position of authority
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; that your name
[1:33:07] that what you say
[1:33:10] he's going to back it
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; your name
[1:33:16] whatever you ask the father in my name
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; I'll give it to you so we find here
[1:33:24] I did a little research on adoption. And
[1:33:27] there is a term out there called
[1:33:29] disownment.
[1:33:32] This term disownment is a term used when
[1:33:34] a parent when they renounce or no longer
[1:33:37] accept
[1:33:39] accept the responsibility to care for a
[1:33:42] child. Disownment
[1:33:45] is the act of formally renouncing,
[1:33:47] denying, or refusing to acknowledge a
[1:33:49] connection with someone or something,
[1:33:52] ceasing to be responsible for them, or
[1:33:54] no longer accepting them as one's own.
[1:33:57] To disown someone means to formally and
[1:34:00] definitely severize with them,
[1:34:02] renouncing any connection, any
[1:34:05] responsibility, or any association with
[1:34:07] them.
[1:34:10] So you as a parent tonight, you can
[1:34:12] disown your child.
[1:34:15] Maybe they're bad. Maybe they've done
[1:34:17] something. Maybe they shamed a family
[1:34:18] name. You can disown them.
[1:34:22] Oh,
[1:34:24] but it works differently for an adopted
[1:34:26] child.
[1:34:28] See, an adopted child, that's a legal
[1:34:31] binding agreement.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; And what does that adoption do? See the
[1:34:36] word here, the adoption creates a
[1:34:38] permanent legal parent child
[1:34:40] relationship. And once finalized,
[1:34:42] adoption grants the adoptive parents the
[1:34:45] same legal rights and responsibilities
[1:34:47] as a biological parent. And this
[1:34:50] relationship is intended to be
[1:34:52] permanent. And though you can disown
[1:34:55] that natural child, there is no legal no
[1:34:58] way that you can disown an adopted
[1:35:00] child. There's no legal process that you
[1:35:03] can go through once you've been adopted.
[1:35:05] You can never Hallelujah. You can never
[1:35:08] be unadopted.
[1:35:11] You can never be unadopted. There's not
[1:35:13] enough legal red tape. There's not a
[1:35:16] great enough lawyer out there that can
[1:35:17] sign the pardon to unadopt you.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; There's no legal process. And if that is
[1:35:25] true in the natural,
[1:35:29] I said, if that's true in the natural,
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; what about the spiritual tonight? Can I
[1:35:34] tell you tonight, you've been quickened.
[1:35:36] You've been adopted. And if you've ever
[1:35:39] been adopted, church, tonight, I don't
[1:35:41] care what kind of past you have. It
[1:35:43] don't matter what your past is. If
[1:35:45] you've been adopted, he will not unadopt
[1:35:47] you tonight. He's chosen you. He's
[1:35:49] called you. He's elected you. And he's
[1:35:52] quickened you. And he's quickened you.
[1:35:55] You belong to him tonight.
[1:36:01] You belong to him.
[1:36:04] You
[1:36:06] have to quicken.
[1:36:08] See, there's a term that they call
[1:36:11] rehome.
[1:36:12] See, Satan tries to rehome an adopted
[1:36:15] child,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; but that's illegal.
[1:36:19] [Music]
[1:36:21] See, you can't rehome.
[1:36:25] Some of you here, I know some of you
[1:36:27] been adopted. You've gone through the
[1:36:29] legal process, but you can't be rehomed.
[1:36:33] It's illegal.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; There's a there's a permanent binding
[1:36:37] agreement with you and that adopted
[1:36:39] family.
[1:36:40] And I'm here to tell you, Satan don't
[1:36:42] have enough rights to rehome you
[1:36:44] tonight.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; He don't have enough authority to rehome
[1:36:47] you tonight. You belong to none other
[1:36:49] than almighty God. He's quickened you,
[1:36:51] placed you in the family. And he says, I
[1:36:53] will not lose one all that the father
[1:36:56] has given to me. I've placed them in my
[1:36:58] family. I quicken them with power. I'll
[1:37:00] anoint them with healing. I will anoint
[1:37:02] them with deliverance. I anoint them
[1:37:04] with the opening of the word. I will
[1:37:05] give them power.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; I tread on serpents and nothing by any
[1:37:11] means will harm them.
[1:37:14] You,
[1:37:16] Sister Jenny, you
[1:37:20] hath he quickened.
[1:37:23] Oh, come on.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:37:27] You,
[1:37:29] Caleb, quickened. Some of you've
[1:37:32] wrestled and wrestled and wrestled for
[1:37:35] years.
[1:37:38] But I'm here to tell you, he told me to
[1:37:39] tell you tonight, you had to quickened.
[1:37:45] quickened,
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; made alive,
[1:37:48] brought to life, who were who was dead
[1:37:53] in sins and trespasses.
[1:37:57] God bless you tonight, church. Remember,
[1:38:00] you had he quickened. Quit looking at
[1:38:03] your past.
[1:38:05] Look to what he's done for you. Amen.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; You may have come in, you may have been
[1:38:09] a drunk, you may have been a prostitute,
[1:38:10] you may have done all these things, but
[1:38:12] look what he's done for you, changed
[1:38:15] your nature, changed your dress, changed
[1:38:18] your attitude, changed your appearance,
[1:38:21] quickening power. God bless you. Come
[1:38:23] on, brother Timothy. Let's lead us in
[1:38:25] some songs of worship tonight. You make
[1:38:28] it personal. You have he quickened.
[1:38:33] I'm alive tonight. I'm not dead in sins
[1:38:35] anymore. I'm not going to be reminded of
[1:38:37] my past anymore. I'm going to rejoice in
[1:38:39] what God has done for me. I'm going to
[1:38:41] sing praises to his name. I'm going to
[1:38:43] shout hallelujah to his name. If he
[1:38:45] wants me to dance, I'll dance. If he
[1:38:47] wants me to worship, I'm going to
[1:38:48] worship. If he wants me to shout, I'm
[1:38:50] going to shout. I'm no longer dead. But
[1:38:52] there's life in my lungs. There's joy in
[1:38:55] my spirit. There's hallelujah in my
[1:38:57] body. I believe, Lord, I've been
[1:38:59] quickened for this moment. I'll be
[1:39:01] changed.
[1:39:02] You has equened church, bride of Jesus
[1:39:05] Christ, rise up and take your position
[1:39:08] as adopted sons of God. Going to turn up
[1:39:12] my praise
[1:39:14] and drown out the dark.

[1:39:32] I will raise up my standard
[1:39:36] and overcome.
[1:39:39] Oh s, can you hear me? This light is for
[1:39:44] you.
[1:39:47] You have no power
[1:39:50] over what I go through.
[1:39:53] Victory making Jesus,
[1:39:57] but he lives in me too.
[1:40:01] I turn up my praise to show you what
[1:40:05] faith can do.
[1:40:08] Going to turn up my praise
[1:40:12] and drown out the doubt.
[1:40:15] Holding my shield of shame.
[1:40:19] And I feel no alone.
[1:40:22] When the enemy comes
[1:40:27] in like a flood,
[1:40:30] I will raise up my standard
[1:40:33] and know
[1:40:39] me. This light is for you.
[1:40:45] You have no power
[1:40:48] over what I go through.
[1:40:51] If you name Jesus,
[1:40:55] but he lives in me, too.
[1:40:58] I'm going to turn up my praise.
[1:41:02] Show you what.
[1:41:06] Going to turn up my praise.
[1:41:14] I feel
[1:41:17] every

[1:41:28] I'll raise up my standard
[1:41:31] and I'm going to turn up my praise.
[1:41:35] Turn up my praise
[1:41:39] and count out.
[1:41:42] Holding my shield
[1:41:46] and I feel the Lord
[1:41:49] [Music]
[1:41:54] my
[1:41:58] [Music]
[1:42:02] God.
[1:42:05] God is good
[1:42:09] all the time.
[1:42:12] He put a song of praise in his heart and
[1:42:17] mind. God is good
[1:42:21] all the time.
[1:42:24] Through the darkest night, his light
[1:42:29] will shine. God is good.
[1:42:33] Oh, God is good.
[1:42:36] All the time, God is good. God is good.
[1:42:41] Oh, all the time.
[1:42:44] He put a song of praise in his heart and
[1:42:50] mind. God is good.
[1:42:53] Oh, all the time.
[1:42:56] Through the darkest night, his light
[1:43:01] will shine. God is good.
[1:43:05] Oh, God is good
[1:43:08] all the time.
[1:43:10] Oh, if you're walking
[1:43:14] through the valley,
[1:43:17] there are shadows all around.
[1:43:22] Oh, do not fear.
[1:43:25] He will guide you.
[1:43:28] He will keep you safe and sound.
[1:43:33] And he has promise
[1:43:36] to never leave me
[1:43:40] or forsake you.
[1:43:42] And his word is true. God is good.
[1:43:48] All the time
[1:43:51] he put a song of praise.
[1:43:55] This heart of mine. God is good
[1:43:59] all the time
[1:44:02] through the darkest night. His light
[1:44:07] will shine. God is good.
[1:44:10] Well, God is good
[1:44:14] all the time.
[1:44:16] and we were sinners
[1:44:19] and so unworthy.
[1:44:22] Still for us, he chose to die.
[1:44:27] He filled us with
[1:44:30] his holy spirit.
[1:44:33] Now we can't stand a test to find
[1:44:39] that his love
[1:44:41] is everlasting
[1:44:43] [Music]
[1:44:45] and his mercy.
[1:44:47] Oh
[1:44:49] never God is good.
[1:44:55] praise
[1:44:59] in this one.
[1:45:01] God is good
[1:45:04] all the time.
[1:45:06] [Music]
[1:45:08] God will
[1:45:11] [Music]
[1:45:12] shine. God is good.
[1:45:15] Oh, God is good.
[1:45:18] Sing that second verse again.
[1:45:21] Oh, we were sinners
[1:45:23] and so unworthy.
[1:45:27] Still for us, he chose to die.
[1:45:32] He filled us with
[1:45:35] his holy spirit.
[1:45:38] Now we can stand and testify.
[1:45:43] Oh, that his love
[1:45:46] is everlasting
[1:45:49] and his mercies
[1:45:52] ain't never end
[1:45:55] [Music]
[1:45:58] all the time.
[1:46:00] [Music]
[1:46:02] of praise in this part of my God is good
[1:46:08] for all time.
[1:46:12] Through the darkest night, his light
[1:46:16] will shine. God,
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; you ask me why I'm happy, so I'll just
[1:46:29] tell you why. Because
[1:46:33] my sins are gone.
[1:46:36] And when I meet the scoffers,
[1:46:40] ask me where they are. I say
[1:46:44] my sins are gone.
[1:46:47] They're underneath the blood on the
[1:46:51] cross of Calvary.
