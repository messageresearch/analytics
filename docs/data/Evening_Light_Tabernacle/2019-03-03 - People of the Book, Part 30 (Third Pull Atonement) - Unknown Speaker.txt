wisdom and guidance now in Jesus name Amen god bless you and good to be in the house of the Lord this morning a man to have each one of you that are gathered with us pray that if you're a visitor today that you won't feel like a visitor when you leave but you'll just feel very much at home amen god bless you for coming today to worship with us we're going to turn to Matthew chapter 17 and we're going to read from the fourteenth verse as we just welcome you today in the name of Jesus Christ welcomed his presence amen Matthew chapter 17 and verse 14 and when they were come to the multitude there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him and saying lord have mercy on my son for he is a lunatic in his vexed for oftimes he falls into the fire and oft into the water and I brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him and they then jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer with you bring him hither to me and Jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour then came to the Sipos to Jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you say to this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you and Peter callin to remember and saith unto Him master behold the fig tree which thou curses is withered away and jesus answered and said unto him have faith in God verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be removed to me thou Casson to see then but shall believe that those things which he set shall come to pass you will have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and that reading was from mark 11 21 through 24 god bless you you can be seated we'd find here that Jesus is speaking about a greater faith I think this is something that the disciples would often ask of Jesus Lord increase our faith and Jesus is speaking of a greater faith and because it mustard seed faith is a faith that is small but yet grows into a great tree and this last day it's a day of a lot of unbelief and if there ever was a day that we need faith it's this day that we're living in a man we need to be able to believe God for his promises especially when we're looking here at the end time and knowing that the rapture of the church is near in the return of Jesus Christ and it's going to take faith to change us in a moment in the twinkling of an eye as we as we see today that is it's often like it was in that day when Jesus was dealing with a very faithless generation at the closing of the Jewish dispensation and that day was very simpler the symbol too similar to our day where that people have got away from the word and just living by the tradition of the elders and certainly we would hope that we would never get to be that way where we would get away from believing God's Word and - and then just accepting traditions of the elders where we formed dogmas and put in our own doctrine that really isn't in the Bible it's really important to stay with the Full Gospel in this day and men be able to preach the full Word of God as Paul would say to Timothy preach the word be on stannum season and out of season a rebuke and with all long-suffering and doctrine it is very important today that the Word of God is preached or we'll never have faith now so we must keep as our absolute the Word of God and our and of course that's the Bible isn't it hey man we've got to keep that as our absolute it must be what we can put our faith upon is the Word of God that no matter what your experience even if whatever it tells you if it isn't if it tells you that the Bible isn't true that the power of God that was there with the Apostles the prophets and teachers as a pastor the gifts of the Spirit isn't the same as it was when it flowed through the Apostles at Pentecost then there's something wrong with your absolute you have to go back to the type host of the Word of God and stead of tired to a denominational Creed a man because he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away so you got to watch what your absolute is and this day an hour we have but one absolute that we must can only trust in and that's the infallible Word of God now we can we can look in our our nation and the natural here around us and see that you know where our pilgrim fathers came here for freedom of religion and a Constitution was formed Gary see our liberties and that Constitution was to be the nation's absolute but today that the Constitution is no longer the nation's absolute as democracy as a democracy America is no longer has its anchor in its constitution today we have elected a leadership who determined to bring a forced equality called socialism and our service today certainly isn't about politics but I'll tell you when you see the desire of the world and you know and the nation that rises in a population now rising among us who does not know the the origins of this country and why that we are here and that is that we can serve God and worship Him and freedom and with liberty we see the rise of this green New Deal that the Democratic Party is pushing and let me just say we're not Democrats neither are we Republicans here we're Christians a man's over this isn't again it's not about politics is about ethics is about what things that are happening in our world today but it's easy to see that we have a world today that is under the Laodicean spirit that they are their Christ rejecters in that crisis on the outside of the church and they that come to the point where we're rich and increased in goods and have need of nothing and yet II would say them yet you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked this is a condition of this last age but Laodicea meaning people's rights or the justice of the people we've never seen an age quite like this where that here in this last church age all nations are rising up demanding equality socially and financially and everybody is to be brought together on the same it's the same plane financially and socially and in every way it's is a day where you know according to our liberal theologians even that Jesus was a socialist and the early church and the guidance of the Spirit practice socialism and thus we ought to do today and so you see it is because there is a complete desire that is in the hearts of a man of man died about one world government for everything to be peace and everything to be equal and everybody have the same well I'll tell you it's not going to happen under politics no matter who you vote in the only way that this is going to happen is far the king of kings and the Lord of lords to the converse Lord of your life and then king of this earth look at the Millennial range and come in and then there will be peace on the earth then there will be justice and equality but nothing that man can do can bring that to pass everybody bit of it is false promises now so yeah but today it's a day an hour where we want to make everything one you know the church the state religious religion and politics coming together it shows you the end time where the tares are all being bound together but it ought to tell us if the terrors are being bound the weed is about ready to be gathered into the garner what a day that will be now you know Laodicea was a city of earthquakes we're speaking of this being replaced in Revelation 3:15 were where he tells us of Laodicea being the last Church eh and it was a city of earthquakes and earthquakes finally destroyed it and this age will end in God shaken the whole world the whole world that has gone off to to love in love with the old harlot system in the world some that will all crumble but the very earth will be shaken and then renovated for a millennial reign hey man what a day an hour that is that we're looking for do we realize right here as we speak today as we just deal with this for a moment how close we are in the endtime process do we see America risin up like a lamb in in Revelation chapter 13 and then begin to speak as a dragon do we see the heart of the people begin to change more and more and more evil until there's no conscience left in our nation and in our world where we can we can kill the unborn where we can destroy little babies in the wounds and then people will applaud that how awful that is in our age in our time the people that are supposed to be a nation under God but you know again we we find in this unity and this oneness you realize in February most of us as missus in the news the Pope and the most important even of the Sunni Muslims signed a peace pact together as they prepared for a one world religion in the Pope and the grid the grand Eamon signed its historic declaration of fraternity calling for global peace between nations and religions and races in front of an audience a global audience of religious leaders from Christianity Islam Judah Judaism and other face don't you realize where we're at church we're at the time they're about ready to crown them and out of Christ they're about ready to get that anyone on one world religion and bring it all down to to the endtime prophecies being fulfilled but before that time you've got to be ready to leave here there's a rapture coming for the Church of Jesus Christ and you've got to be prepared for it and that's why we're here today we're not here to talk politics we're not here to talk about about even all this the social evils in the world but we are here talking about how we can prepare to be that people of faith here in this endtime who will have that overcoming faith and overcome and power to rise above Satan burglar and sin and unbelief now the Bible tells you very clearly in the Book of Daniel about the kingdoms of this world he would see it as as a great image that he would see and it would be a head of gold and then go down into lesser-quality metals until it finally comes down to the feet and we would see that it would be babbling and then the kingdom of give away to Medes and Persians and then to the Greek and I'm to Rome and then iron in the clay which comes right down to Romanism and communism together but I want you to remember that when it reached the feet as it comes down to the end the Bible said daniel said I saw a stone that was cut out without hands hey man this is not a man-made government this is not a man-made power amen but this is God's own power striking the feet of that that image and all the kings of the world would crumble and then that stone would become a great mountain oh brother I'll tell you this for this is promised all the wicked and the atheists and the agnostics and the modernists and the Liberals that will all be there to be destroyed here in this end time but there's going to be a people missing that's the bride of Jesus Christ you and I need to be prepared to meet the Lord now of course this there is not just the tears that are being gathered but there is also the that has been gathered and of course that this gathering will be a physical translation out of disease and to do that will require that there be a people who will give the word preeminence and that the word would have the headship in other words it means more to them than what everybody else is saying than what the world is the Korean is is right or wrong in but they give the word of God the preeminence and let the word of God be what is right and call what is right right and wrong wrong hey man now all my friends to do this we got to be returned to the original atomic and that's where we're at to come back to the atonement of the blood to see Christ in his whole power a men took make it word that there is nothing impossible with you a man to bring you into that place of faith whether your faith is operating as a son or daughter of God I'd like I'd like just to paraphrase Matthew four chapter 4 where Jesus ministered from place to place throughout all the problems of Galilee and he taught in the synagogues preaching the hope of the kingdom realm and healing every kind of sickness and disease among the people his fame spread everywhere many people who were in pain and suffering with every kind of illness were brought to Jesus for their healing epileptics paralytics and even those tormented with and will by demonic powers were all set free than die I like the way it concludes it everyone who was brought to Jesus was healed and I don't want to say today all that we might get men to Jesus because everyone that is brought to Jesus is healed this is a God who is a healer who can take you out of you your sinful state and make you a son of God who can take you out of your broken health and heal you and bring deliverance oh that we can get you to Jesus oh that we can have Jesus in our mets this morning as a healer I deliver and people have a faith that will operate and bring down that very presence of God into the church where everybody brought to Jesus is delivered I can look at you I can look at many of you and I can remember the day where you were brought to Jesus and when you got into his presence hey man when you got into his presence you were healed you were delivered your life has never been the same now I'm just gonna go back just historically just for a little bit as we as we speak about some things this morning I just want to speak about some things that were that we're at in this time in this hour you know in 1946 an angel of God came to William Branham and and there he told him that he was commissioned by God to go and carry a gift of divine healing to the world and this is part the great divine healing revivals and that happened in the 1940s and the 50s it would be the same man that in his in his meetings that as he would preach that there would be men and women that would stand up and prophesize speak in tongues and say else john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ you are sent with a message to 4-run the second coming of christ um you know there he would go out and and there would be a divine healing move that would be sparked it would be other great men that would get inspiration it would be all Roberts that would meet him after the service one day and then talk to him and say do you believe that God would hear my prayers it would be if it would be men like you know other great men of God that in that era of time that also would give the spark from that meetings and ends where they was seeing God do his work in anonymity showing his healing power and His grace amen but then then we come nine years later in the year 1955 it had been nine years since the angel of God it appeared and since william branham two 4runners coming starting out with a gift to divine healing and showing the same power of the original atonement now to begin with the divine healing movement was was embraced and welcomed by all the Pentecostal denominations and especially by the Assembly of God but by 1955 the denominations were now withdrawing their support mainly due to financial reasons because even though William Branham was not after money and would make that clear would not let them beg or plead for money in his campaigns and once he took enough offerings to pay for the expenses of meeting he could take in offerings because he was afraid of three things he said that always got a preacher which was money women in popularity and knowing that he was raised support man and that money would not be as weakness he wouldn't even look at it but he would have his managers to take care manage they expense and and the men that was helping him in the meetings that he paid to go along to help set up the meetings and so on while he prayed and waited on God for for the his for the prayer lines and praying for the sick but 19:55 now there was so many emulators and impersonators that the field was now crowded with divine healers and they used the promise of healing to lure to take money from the people and some of them would would report said I know when it's God's will for me to move on and that's when I'm taking up offerings and I begged and I told him and then he said I literally take him up and shake him up and down until until all the pennies fall out of their pocket then I know it's time to move on to another meeting and that became the emphasis of the divine healing movement by and large was how much money we can get out of the people instead of pointing to the atonement and the power of God bringing souls to Christ the emphasis changed the kingdom building now let me tell you of course this would cause the denominations to get jealous of this money they wanted for themselves and for their churches and to build up their you know their their little kingdoms of man in this age of impersonate this is an age of impersonation like as the Bible said as Janice and generous wizard Moses Janice and Jeffrey's you know would come after the true prophet of God and they would use gifts for they were gifting and I met Moses throw down his rod and become a servant they threw down rods and they become a serpent they were gifted a man and Satan can't create they were using gifts of God but their purpose was to keep them an Egyptian bondage rather than to bring them into the freedom amen the key visual as slaves this was their purpose it was not to bring a Liberty even sassette keep them in the same all to bondage that there always was a man that God wants his people to be free a man God wants his people to be able to move in the spirit he wants to be able to work among them he wants to make them into sons and daughters of God he wants to equip them with power with an anointing a man he wants them to be able to live overcoming lives he wants to be the Holy Ghost in your life and your leader and your guide he doesn't want some preacher leading and guide you he wants the Holy Spirit to be the one with preeminence in your life that's what God wants the impersonators would crowd the field during this divine healing movement riding on his coattails they claim the biggest tenth the most healings the largest crowds the greatest miracles the largest magazines with the most subscribers and this is what it all became about now should we be shocked today when we come down here where we're at in time and we see even today there impersonators rising wanting to be the prophet coming with their own revelations outdone the Prophet where they've become more gifted than he more intellectual with better clarity more able to bring revelation than the very messenger that God would send you see Paul would say it once I'm gone there are going to be previous wolves that will come in and they'll not spare the flock once I'm going they'll come and they'll claim equal revelation for their purposes not to help you but destroy you and this became the goal of many that would rise up in Paul's day and would stand there claiming greater revelation than what Paul had can you imagine paul the apostle of jesus christ with revelation and then even before she said i am forced to boast i'm forced to tell you I too am an apostle I've met the Lord many among the road to Damascus III have been there in the depths of the sea three days a night I've been whipped I've been dealt ii-i've had miracle in signs and wonders of all as he said you're forcing me to have to boast to be able to prove my Apostleship because why by now there was so many rising up impersonating Paul bringing revelations until he when he would say of Jaime Gnaeus and philetus I had turned him over the demo because they're saying the resurrection is past and Paul it speak to he had preached a spiritual resurrection that we are resurrected in Christ a man that we are that we have risen with Christ and who sit with him in heavenly places and he preached that but here it comes for leaders and high media so long and what are they doing they are they are coming with a greater revelation and now because this has happened to us and we are now in the in the resurrection and we are now already seen it happen and we're risen with Christ that now there's not going to be the resurrection of the Dead it's all over and it's all finished we're beyond it we're past sounds all too familiar amen the Paul would say I haven't shunned to declare to you the gospel of God in Acts chapter 2 and verse 27 28 now take heed therefore unto yourself and all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he had purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock and also of your own selves shall arise men arise speaking perverse things which that's their own ideas of their own word and not God's to dwell away disciples after themselves notice this started in early hey man you see Satan it was enough for him to discredit the resurrection it wasn't enough for him to come along and say that stole away his body and they paid off you know everybody just to say that give this report it wasn't enough to spread lies upon it deny that he had risen from the dead but now here it is he comes along and he comes even in the church itself many men rising up with perverse things and men their own ideas and not God's words to draw look at the Berbers to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember that I've bought the space in three years I ceased not to warn every night and day with tears and now brethren I commend you to God and to the word of His grace which is able to build you up listen what is it that is able to build you up the word come on a man and to give you an inheritance among all of them which are sanctified what is it that's able to give you an inheritance the word that's why we've got to come back to the word in his full power my mountain-moving faith faith that were that and that is tree-killing faith I'm a mountain-moving faith a faith that was once delivered to the Saints of faith that Jesus said we ought to every one possess amount but you see these days they all crowd the field he's trying to be the greatest in their revelatory nonsense Menten child a revelation of the Godhead and say that Jesus is just a man and not even God can you imagine that you know the Pharisees accused Jesus of being a man who made himself God he was crucified for that reason him being a man made us have God but it wasn't that at all he was God who made himself a man a man God came down into human flesh and gave His life and redeemed us by the blood are you with me others have a revelatory non sense of the own the mercy-seat saying they're in the mercy seat and God's chosen places of worship and there's no mercy but except of course in their group they claim the power remitting retaining sins and both to be able to cast those who disagree with them in the outer darkness my goodness that ain't nothing to brag about Amen oh my when our attitude becomes toward another because of a disagreement and we'll cast you into outer darkness I'll tell you one thing I'm glad God doesn't give power to sinful men because that's sinful men amen the desire of every true Christian is that all would be safe even jesus said it's a set of him God so loved the world he gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life for he came not to condemn the world but that all the world through you might be saying well god help us to have the spirit of Jesus then will not condemn everybody else we want to see every men safe God don't lose a one of them that's so that's something ought to be a burden of this church his Lord helped me to speak to some soul help me help me find somebody that I just listened just for a moment that we can lift their burden that we can bring him in the present like I said a while ago all that we we might get men to Jesus because why today the emphasis is on give them to church and church can't save you and we didn't get to the church but oh if we can get you in God's presence and that's where the responsibility of a group like dancers bring such an atmosphere that it welcomes the Lord Jesus and he comes down in our midst because when he is here darkness leaves the light turns old demons or expelled darkness leaves Alleluia and people who once walked in darkness see a great light and blinded eyes come open and healing begins makes a man a real man and a woman a real lady makes sons and daughters out of those who were lost and undone this is the gospel and we imagine today when things become so Spiritualized until the actual rapture and the literal and physical return of Jesus is even mocked can we imagine a day and time where this is no longer our expectancy the time of the delay that Peter spoke about we said in the end time there would be mockers rise scoffers Satan where is the sign of his coming and people are going on as if things are going to continue on forever and every every sign every corner when God's got warning signs and flagman out with waving a red flag saying is coming to them and they go right on through it now so you see Church we're here in the time where were that that we we must keep our expectancy on the return of the Lord Jesus because that is the greatest hope of the hour without that we've lost everything so our whole focus ought to be on Lord come back for us whatever you do don't leave us here darkness is coming on the world and evil is rising in every way that we can look socially economically spiritually it's evil give him worse and worse and worse the day is getting darker as we go along every generation gets worse as I was saying even about our Constitution and and things you know them the Millennials the millennialist they are speaking about today you know that they they never they never fought a war they don't know anything about what it took to make this country what it is they have no they have no idea of the sacrifices that have been made to afford them this freedom and now they're ready ready to sell it off into socialism into communism can you imagine what a day that we're living in but over what an hour we ought to be friends when we when we everyone have the opportunity to meet the same Christ you see they cannot and we cannot today go back and meet our Pilgrim Fathers and we can't go and meet a John Quincy Adams or Thomas Jefferson or somebody letter tell us what this Constitution meant what we stood for how we fought for it and our principles but I tell you that may not be true about right here as Americans but I'll tell you as Christians every one of us can have that dress and up-to-date experience and meet Jesus Christ for ourselves and here might be a historical God but a present it's God [Applause] and there's no excuse there's no excuse because once you ever meet him then you know his deliverance power is what he wants to give you know his healing powers what he wants to church to have you'll know his saving power a man in his keepin power a man is what he wants to give the church amen this is what he wants remember Jesus answer to them said have faith in God this is a word that we got to have in this day have faith in God you cannot have faith in politics you cannot have faith even in the religions of this world there's only one thing our faith is gonna be anchored in and that's God hey man notice he said for I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain he wants to bring a people in the mountain-moving faith be removed and be thou cast in the sea shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe those things which he saith shall come to pass now Jesus is telling us some very key things here first of all he said whosoever that means that power is open to every one of his children it's not just for preachers it's not for bishops it's not proposed it's for whosoever are you one of them this morning then it is for you whosoever whosoever shall say to this mountain amen now Jesus was looking at a literal mountain but let me tell you something you got mountains in your life there's things that needs to be removed things that you've been dealing with that you shouldn't have to deal with something in your way you can't get through but I'll tell you this God wants to give people mountain-moving faith a man that will move out the hindrances in your life I mean we have down too long with sickness we've got too long with sin we've let them death too long and I love demon powers to control our lives control our families it's time that we realize who we are as sons of God amen that God gets given whosoever moms are moving faith if I can get you to say if you'll start speaking to your mountain I mean in your hearts quit letting down when yeah I know every time that you try to stand up for the word of God that begins to come and fight against you but I'm trying to say to you this Lord with allowing doubt to win and start ahead in your faith rise up and when over doubt wins it Satan's unbelief ever become greater than God's Word my doubt is Satan's unbelief when sure that you be given more preeminence and in your mind in your heart Satan's word should never have preeminence you're a believer a man Satan's word I've no right to have preeminence in you you need the Word of God is a high preeminence now so whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things that he saith shall come to pass in man he shall have whatsoever he saith now you're either gonna believe this or rip it out of your Bible we're either going to take it and believe it's the Word of God or we're just gonna say it's for another generation it's not for us take it out of my Bible there's got to be a people in this day race a rapture an hour there's got to be a people with rapture and faith hey man somebody that I believe is word a man that whatsoever things you decide hey man you when you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them hey man oh god he's lifting up something to us in the word this morning a man that a people start believing God because when we get into his presence things begin to happen are you with me now a man now so as we're as we're speaking on this let me just go down for a moment because you know when when william branham thought about this scripture this marked 1122 if you say to this mountain if you ask what you will it shall be given to you and you begin to think about it he and he thought first soon as it's out now you know because like us all he dealing with his own I'm believing his own doubting well somebody asked me about the scripture I just have to say it was before the atonement was given and so you know then because of that it's not in the atonement and he's sitting there thinking about that as he was contemplating it as something as he began to think about it and he and God began to speak to him and so what about these miracles and things that has happened in your ministry you think it was you doing that do you think it was your own power what no then he was God's power through the atonement and then he then he spoke out loud said if the person now I want you to get this if the person through the atonement sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ can live in such a sphere with God so close that he can be so wrapped so completely in God by the blood of Jesus that it wouldn't be him talking it would be the Holy Spirit speaking these things hallelujah can you imagine a people so under the atonement so much under the blood Amen that God is just using their lips to speak to them because they become an extension of his of his power through His grace can you imagine how two people a person through the atonement sanctified by the blood of Jesus I wonder do we realize where we stand who have received the blood of Jesus do we realize that we are sanctified we are cleansed that there's not one sin a man that we stand before him justified there he sees us because like we were in his mind before the world ever began and he sees us without spot or without wrinkle or without a blemish so that you through that blood can come boldly before the throne of grace to find help in your time of need how many needs help this smaller man well I'll tell you there is a place of help and that's before the throne of grace were that you can come in boldly under the mud under the atonement a man and with such a spear so full with God so close so wrapped completely in God by the blood of Jesus is not you talk him any more it be the Holy Spirit speaking out of you a mouth now listen when Jesus was on the earth he walked upon the earth He healed the sick he cleanse a leopard he cast out Devils by word is that the truth by a word he would do that everywhere he went he conquered now we're saying we're in his kingdom and we're sons and daughters of God then we're living beneath our privileges because everywhere Jesus went from Hoonah a man there was deliverance it was brought and that's the way it ought to be in the Church of God a man than ever where his bride goes everywhere his church goes there's deliverance hey mom now I just like to read you some scripture here about it Matthew chapter 8 verse 16 when the evening was come they brought unto Him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that verse it let's go back over that again I think we may have glossed over it they brought unto Him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits how with his word now isn't this the same thing he did to the victory with his word he spoke to the big tree in the life left it isn't this what he said that would happen to the mountain with the word if you say to this mountain be thou removed so Jesus not only was telling his disciples then that you know that day had mountain-moving faith that if you just got the faith of a grain of mustard seed if that mustard see the phasors planet it'll grow into a mighty tree man it'll be a mighty faith and that be the move mountains that prey that casts out Devils that faith oh my that faith will bring healing to the sick that faith will work in God's people everywhere that faith is applied that peace will even work for your lost loved ones oh man that faith we'll go out and find them where they're at in the darkest dungeons of Satan's hell and bring a black to Christ that's the power of believers prayer words they say he sent his word and healed them he cast out the demons and spirits with his word and healed all that were sick with his word not didn't didn't the the Roman centurion have a revelation of that hey man he come down and said you know my my servant is sick and and it's dying come and pray for our you know would you would you pray for me he said I'll come to your house he said no there's no need to come to my house just speak the word now he it might have been miles to his place and didn't matter how far these words travel and spirits on the Holy Spirit every man and right there would go right there to the very place where his servant was laying there dying and the word would rebuke the devil that held him bound and be healed so he said look I'm a man I'm the man of authority I'm a man of authority i I know how this works I I don't go myself I send this cat this one in here and this from there these legions here and these there to go out and do do the bidding I just speak the word and it gets done said I know you're a man of authority and all you've got to do is speak the word and they and my servant Illya now that was a Gentile heaven faith it's about time we come to realize with the gentiles that it was speaking about gentiles having faith mark 1:22 and they were astonished at his doctrine I want you to look at this and we pride ourselves sometimes in having the correct doctor men will go to great extents preaching great sermons great depths and great understanding and you know that Wow's you with their intellect oh how they put this together and put that together and most of the time is a cow in the top of the tree eating grass when they get all their picture drawn it's very phenomenal and the Bible said and they were astonished at his doctrine why for he taught as one that had Authority and not as the scribes now his doctrine was different wasn't it and there was in their synagogue a man and with unclean spirit and he cried out saying let us alone what have we to do with these out Jesus under that Jesus of Nazareth are thou come to destroy so I know the who thou art the Holy One of God and Jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him and when the unclean spirit had torn him and cried with a loud voice he came out of him and they were all amazed in so much that they questioned among themselves saying what thing is this what new doctrine is this for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits and they do obey him now this is what the doctrine of Jesus anew hey man we want to preach true doctor knowing doctrine without this Authority is not his doctor it's just doctor this man made ideas but when you get the doctor to Jesus that's what we want to preach the doctrine of Jesus we've had enough doctor the man of Jesus will command even I clean spirits do you know people come down to the altar and leave with her same old dirty lust spirit and their same old drinkin spirit and their same Oh cigarette spirit and their same old dumb spirit going right along with them and it come down the altar for prayer go right back the same way they are that's not the doctrine of Jesus man the doctrine of Jesus though your sins be as scarlet there will be white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be white as wool as far as the East is from the West I will remove your sins from you that's the doctrine of Jesus Jesus fills you with his own holy spirit that empowers you to live a life for victory and penalize over soon that's the doctrine of Jesus man and you cannot talk to teach the doctrine of Jesus without having and using the authority of Jesus too many today we're saved we're seeing people saved in their sins and not from their sins let me tell you when you get in his presence he will not leave you the way he found you you will be forever changed you can get in church and leave out the same old sinner you came in but you ever get in Christ one time just get in Christ all things have passed away and behold all things have become new you cannot be the same person anymore your chains in his presence amen so the soui he said well they said what new doctrine is this for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits and they do obey Him this something is very soon that was said of every believer and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name I'm leaving you in my stead for you to act in my name and in my name you shall cast out Devils a man you will heal the sick you speak with new tongues if you take up serpents it shall not harm you hey man come on dude this is the Word of God this is the word the last words that Jesus spoke and he taught and his words had authority and we are not preaching the words of Jesus unless the authority of Jesus accompanies the words a man was everywhere he went he conquered a man everywhere you go your to conquer your son of God the daughter of God in His image in his likeness come on you know that species brings forth species it's the law of God that everything bring forth of its kind humans bring forth humans dogs read more dogs cats bring forth cats come on but I tell you we're preaching about a new birth and when you're born of glob God brings forth God's sons of God then the image of God people that know their God and do exploits they stand on that word they declare it to be the truth he didn't say you had the power he said you had the authority you say it I'll do it whatever you bind on earth I'll bind it in heaven whatever you loose on earth I'll loosen in heaven these are the words of Jesus that all will be art words today we ought to be taking God's words as our word there were sons of God we're of his species we're of his genis come on of his genis of his kind now everywhere Jesus went he conquered a man he conquered everything that could be conquered he conquered passions pride sickness Devils when he died he conquered death when he rose he conquered hell oh man he went up and conquered everything that was against mankind and when did the red wine press of God and crushed it down and conquered death hell and the grave sickness formalities everything he overcome it and rose again on the third day and conquered all the atmospheres above and cut that mist between God and man and connected heaven together again through Christ you have a connection back to heaven through Christ you have the power to rule older as a son of God hey man there is tens of mighty conquer since he ripped that veil into he's got the keys of death and hell on my side he says fear not a man I am he that was dead but behold I am alive forevermore and I've got the keys of death and of Hell hey man there he was he raised said don't fear I'm the first and the last so therefore he cut ever obstacle between God and human beings that they might be connected like they were in the Garden of Eden a man you there again you know this does make chunky but man then is omnipotent anywhere his faith can work it's all power everywhere that he operate as a son of God omnipotence goes to work that omnipotence will cast out Devils that omnipotence gives you power to live an overcoming life usually brother Tim I got I'm a Christian and I've had this habit and I can't overcome it let me tell you friends you ever get a real drink to the Holy Ghost overcome and power will be on the inside of you and because that overcoming power there you overcome that thing you'll rise up above it it'll come underneath your feet you are not meant to be conquered you were met and ordained to be a conqueror hey Matt a man fully surrendered to gardeners omnipotence if he can surrender his mind to God let the mind that was in Christ be enough he gets a render his mouth his mind his body his vessel any time he can surrender to God there's a nepeta a man sea supreme faith makes you omnipotent it would take omnipotence to move a mountain come on only God can move a mountain you know you can't just stand there and say that mountain be moved all on your own but as a son of God under the influence of God under the anointing of God hey man now remember what brother Branham said those words I originally about a moment ago about it all being their Toolman and and he said when I said that a super anointing came over me man brother when we begin to agree with the word say what the word said declare our super anointing comes down a mount now so what have you saved with that creative power of an appearance knowing God promised and he said in a word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things that pass things that is not and makes them as though they are because to omnipotence is Matt how did to omnipotence meet when your faith and man rises there to that level of the promise that significance and God coming down in anointing that faith that significance and doing that begin to speak there's a power goes out and something happens a man this is why he would say to John don't fear a little flock don't fear John I all that I am your air - oh my our sewers my nipples is yours as I stand in your midst notice if he's not in our mitts we're just a dead church we're just a dressed up bejeweled corpse a man but it's still a corpse no matter how pretty you make the building man matter how wonderful you make the singer if God ain't in it we're just a dead church but when God comes down diffidence begins to work cancers begin to cast out demons we get the free hallelujah that's what we want to see is an impotent speakin power because why faith has been placed in God notice he would say my Nipponese is yours as I stand in your midst brother this is why we declare he's right here in this last age right here in the middle of this church standing in the midst of his golden candlesticks right here in the last stage he said I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you I say what I promise I say what a work that is I'll tell you we can feel this spirit lift in the world lifting the nice and lifting society lifting families lifting out the churches but all God when you lift up from this earth take me with you because I don't want to be here when Satan is the king of this earth for in rains for that short time in the tribulation I don't want to be here all my power is given to you and it's yours to use you speak the word and I'll perform it that's my covenant and they can never fail it's time we start using the word against our enemy time we start standing up for what's right speaking against what's wrong men he would say we are so thankful to be on speaking terms the blood of Jesus Christ puts us in this condition think about that that's what the blood have the blood positions you it positions you in a place where you're on speaking terms that whatever you ask in my name I will do it is that his word a man is either the truth or isn't it rude somebody's gonna believe it might as well be you might as well be you listen listen even even brother Branham would say himself I'm your brother standing as your brother and then a saucer try my best to hold you before God and I'm standing right here before the white throne now and pointing my finger to that bloody sacrifice there and speaking through his name that is done it has to happen and that's the way we all stand we're pointing to a bloody sacrifice will play pointing to one who paid our debt a man paid our dues we don't know the devil of things Satan has no claim on us we do not belong to him we're not his children we're not his subjects he's not our God he's not our King and we're not his slave and I'll tell you it's time we quit acting like we're still a slave of the devil and realize we're people put to the white throne a man toward that bloody sacrifice there speak in his name is done a man ma that ought to be something we do because he's there to make the intercession for us he's a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities which means he empathizes with you not sympathizers he's been through it himself he walked the earth with you a man he met the devil himself and everywhere that he met him he cast him out does that tell you what your job is to do a man ever where you meet the devil cast him out a man because this is where he promised I'll be there with you even in you to the end of the world now so he is there as a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities our only intercessor between God and man is Jesus Christ now that's according to the Bible you might have others to try but there's only one that God's hears and that's Jesus Christ our prayers go through him hey Matt don't you believe a lie that Jesus is and I our intercessor anymore and it's um now now some group of people it is she is him but he is not her I hope you heard that she is him but he is not her amen don't confuse the roles he's the Redeemer where the redeemed he's the Savior we're the same hey man he's the healer come on we're just we dis act in his name hey man you see she we cannot do his work his work is the atonement her work is faith in the atoning so God has a work the bride has a work Jesus is saying my father workers and I work at hitherto we ought to be the same builders say my father worker than we work as hitherto hey man how is it he paid the price we just go and collected everything back from Satan hey man we go take the spoils he bound the strongman we just go into the house and get everything that was ours and take it back man that's why the church ought to be doing today a man is following Jesus our captain who who bound us from one someone greater than Satan someone greater than Satan someone stronger than Satan came up bound his house I'm quoting you from the Bible he came and he bound his house someone beggar someone stronger is your Jesus greater is he stronger did he find him did he pay the price did he bind him better with his death at Calvary and then the devil is found and all you got to do is go and collect the spoils don't get back what the devil stole from you three bestowed your joy go get it back if he stole your peace go get it baby stole your children go get it back whatever the devil stole you get it back from him trap oh you ever saw a button not a slave you don't have to take another beating from help you don't have to be another time weapon you are free [Applause] and take problems [Applause] he's the waterpocket see look all diseases that's here to deliver the savior hey man your needs supplier hallelujah sure we're to intercede on the behalf of others hey man that's what prayin is all about believers interceding through prayer about a need but the bride isn't the intercessor there's only one that God hears and that's Jesus Christ and we approach God through his sacrifice and through him he hears us hey man you see you deny the body that's the atonement the sacrifice you denied the body the blood or the word you're dead the minute you do it and that's what Satan wants to see it to us to do today is deny the body deny the atonement deny who we are in Christ deny the the the power of that blood that makes us tongue in its presence as a son of God so when you deny the body the blood the word of Jesus Christ you're dead the minute you do it Satan's got you you see again it's God's chosen place of worship where he puts his name not in the church but in his son now it was under the power of the blood the atonement that Moses created let's you think of that per minute Moses created Moses took with words created are you with me hey man he called for flies and flies Kings he called for frogs and probes came any man he called for darkness and darkness came he called for light to take over the darkness and light came whatever Moses folk got back backed it up now friends that was not even under the atonement of Christ that was under the Tollman of blood and bulls of bulls and goats hey man so tell me which is greater the blood of Christ or the blood of bulls and goats so the blood the blood of a looking to looking to the sacrifice of Jesus put a man named Moses on speaking terms and Moses created with that word a man so now the power above bulls in the blood of bulls and goats gave power to Moses to go out there by the commission of God stretch out his rod and say let her come flies you see had the word of God he spoke that word when he did it came from God's thought forward is assault expressed and so God thought it and put it in Moses mind now friends let me just tell you God taught it and he's written it right here in the Bible amen and you can read it and it comes in your mind a mouth now Moses started God thought of me and Moses come in Moses mind put it Moses mind call for prize he called for 5ko for a cover for plagues to come and he called him one by one Colonel turn to a Nile into blood and it would all turn to blood he did that under the power of the blood of bulls and goats which has no power today because it's all fulfilled in Christ you sacrifice all the animals you want to and it not produce anything it was only looking to a greater lamb coming so Moses Moses there spoke and now it becomes a word now what once it's spoken it's a word and once it becomes a word it's released and once it's released Moses turn around maybe there wasn't a fly in the country and the hours from them you know maybe one old green fly began to buzz around and a half an hour there was maybe ten pounds per square yard what was it the creative word of god that was spoke by the lips of a mortal man and Jesus is saying the same thing to you take the word place it on your lips you tell me you tell me well what is his sword the Word of God you tell me what the book of Revelation says where it's held it is mouth you see the sword cannot stay on your side in your scabbard as a decoration you're a soldier and it's got to come out of the scabbard amen I'm spoken with your lips put in your mouth and you begin to speak what God said first thing you need to be is starting to speak in what God said about you I am a son of God I have been bought with the blood of Jesus Christ amen I am the righteousness of God in him amen I have his peace man I have his authority he's commissioned me he sent me to the earth at this time I'm here for a reason and for a purpose I'm here to serve God in the service command and now I've got a situation here I take dominion over it you you need to get up in the morning look in the mirror and say I'm a blob washed black box summer order of the Living God and I am here to torment Devils I am NOT here to be tormented by Devils I am here to get the devil a hard time that's lovely as I'm here on this earth that's what I'm here for I'm here to overcome I'm here to rise up above I'm here to meet the challenges I'm here to defeat the devil anywhere by the word anywhere any place any time because that's what God called a people to do people that's in his image and his likeness now God could use some air you know God uses men that's how he uses he said I'm the vine you are the branches the branches bears the fruit not deveined that right when he came here he was he was the first branch that came out of the mind and he did the works through God he said he that believeth on me the works said I do shall he do also amen so then you become you become the the branch now then he's expecting you to bear fruit and he said anything they ain't bad fruit he said he purchased it then I'll bring forth more fruit so the very thing the purging that you're going through is so that you will bear fruit so well I had this problem in my life God did it God's given an opportunity for your faith to go to work I mean or the trial I know or Natalia it's an opportunity not a trial it's an opportunity for your faith to go to work why did this happen to me so my faith would have something to work on a mass that's exactly right this is this is subtly the way you've got to start looking at your trials that you're going through it is something not to destroy me I cannot be destroyed a happy turtle life I cannot be destroy this is not gonna destroy me I am here to destroy it Satan your kingdoms coming down no weapon that is formed against we can prosper I'm the son of God I've been bought by the blood I know who I am in Christ God uses men God I could use the Sun to preach the gospel could use the wind to preach the gospel but God chose men to preach the gospel that's his God's Way hey man God's going to use you he will use you to try them to over the devil hey Matt it'll be your prayers that cast him out a man it'll be your voice speaking against the enemy it'll be you standing there with the Word of God amen now but you know but you know here here again Moses under the blood of bulls and goats you know there he spoke a word of creation you know he stumbles sometimes you know God could speak a squirrel into existence God did it God could do let me tell you God was using Moses and he spoke flies life means he spoke all kinds of things you know what he was doing no not to tournament God's people but to free God's people and he was using the power of God to plague the devil does that give you any idea what you're to use the power God far not to be a puck doesn't be a you know a stuffed shirt but to plague the devil to make the devil so miserable then he finally says to you get out get out of my country get out of Egypt leave here go on and you'll say yeah we're going and we're leaving a hook line wherever one going listen what's the matter with the church today what is wrong here brother Brandon would say my opinion we're not coming with that sincerity to the right thing for if God could do that by the blood of bulls and goats and bulls that only covered sin and made appropriation for the Center but the sin was still there only covered ever what can he do to the blood of his son that omits in God has not not a factor but created a blood that takes away all sin I believe that sin will be broke up when it's confessed I've on the basis of the blood of Jesus Christ it's like dropping a drop of black ink into a bunch of Clorox bleach it just breaks it and they the chemicals and sends it plumb back to where it come from and that's the way the blood of Jesus Christ does that sends a man across the chasm again as a son of God and then why the the creative power God is in him and at least whenever God can command it to be done it'll be done but the blood puts us back on speaking terms it's time we hear the voice of God the voice of God is speaking why are you crying to me speak this is what he told him Moses he's met with an obstacle he said why are you crying to me what is all this moaning about you ought to be speaking you ought to be looking at your problem and saying it's coming down the red seats coming open hey man and when it does he's gonna drown all the Pharoah in this army all the devils are gonna be dead behind us and we're gonna be like Miriam with a tambourine shot into victory because we're not believing from here I defeated people we are leaving here victorious people a victorious church without spot or wrinkle are you with me hey man so you stand in the presence of God as a redeemed son now that's why the church is living far below it's privileged and instead of instead of coming out and facing the issue we're still just kind of probing at it wondering if it'll work but it's time we realize who we are how many's more sermons are we going to have to hear that that identifies in Christ as who we are is this children face the issue face up to it face up to the fact that you are under an atonement that your sins are forgiven that you have no past I'm looking at a people today who has a blank past there is no charge that the devil can lay on you because it's all been dealt with by the blood of Jesus Christ come on now and you stand guiltless as a son of God he never see it doesn't see anymore where you faltered where you failed where you made a mistake where were you equivalent where you had disbelieved it's all gone and you stand before him as a son of God amen under an atonement and because you're under that atonement now you can go before the throne of grace anytime and find help in your time of need a man so there's something wrong somewhere and brother branham's would say I think it's cause the denominational system has twisted the minds and so forth until they don't know how to do it but we promised it would be revealed and that's where we're living at church we're in the day of the revealing where we come back to the doctrine of Jesus Christ amen and that doctor has power it hey man that's that's why we can look around today and witness and say we have seen and are seeing the power of God we know what did you do to cancer we know what interview to brain bleeds we know what did it do to alopecia we know what they do to ever devil come on we're not worthy to do to drunkenness and drugs and alcohol and then we know what they'll do to cigarettes we know what to do for young people hey man we know what to do two sons of God a man rila bait them into position where they know who they are and they know who their God is so they knew exploits hey man that's the thing you see we're we're we're living the hour where we're no longer just to pray a prayer man but command let it be done now command God command the devil leave God's already commanded us to command him in my name you'll cast out metal that's a that is a command you've already got the command we don't have to command God and then we command the devil to leave a man resists the devil submit yourself to God resist the devil he shall flee from you are you with me but you see God will never meet anybody unless they come under the shed but it's the only meeting place of God and when you turn to blood down your meeting place has been taken away you see God made his first decision in the Garden of Eden that that man could only worship Him under the shed blood of his sacrifice and that's the only place that God met God that God met with man then and that's the only guard place that God ever will meet with me so when you take the blood away you take your meeting place away hey man your faith is gotta be placed in the blood in the atonement now you see there again that's the only place he meets his man is under the blood of his sacrifice now he won't meet you there as a Methodists or Baptists or Catholic or or whatever it is said that the denominational claim he will not meet you there as that he will meet you where wherever you are if you Methodist Baptist Catholic Pentecostal wherever if you come under the shed but he will meet you there amen because that is the meeting place so therefore this is where that we have our power that's where the the power lays is in the atonement when we meet there is that place under the blood then the power that blood goes to work on our behalf without it your meeting place is done away with you don't have a place to meet God he'll meet you under one condition where you're on to that blood and your sins are confessed and been expelled in his presence and he only can see them through that shed blood and your wife's know when you confess your sins your sins are forgiven but outside of that you're not there you can't fellowship and that's the reason that you don't see things happen in the churches they confess they believe the blood but reject the very plan to get to the blood the word and that's the only way that God will honor that word you see you'll never honored say I'm a Baptist I'm the method as I'm a Catholic I demand this to be done you can't do it like that the only way is through His grace come through this shed blood and say lord I claim the promise and then you're really under that blood and God is obligated to his word but first you've got to be under the mud and once under the blood God's obligated to his word he's obligated to back up whatever you say a man to stand behind your words a man no wonder then they can't believe in miracles can't believe in the supernatural because they condemned the bud let's talk about the blood for a moment let's talk about the blood in the work of that blood now how did the blood come about and how is it that we're under the blood you see we can always go on and say well we're under the blood well into the blood and we're talking about those pints of blood that came down out of the cross the cross and fell down to the ground and that's not the blood we're under the blood were under is that blood came by the creative power of God somebody with me hey man God took a blood cell by creation now you were talking about creation and pepper a place in the womb of Mary both did the ovum and the sperm and out of that came a body for God to come and dwell in that's what I was saying God became a man that's what the mystery was Jesus didn't just didn't make himself God God made himself a man and God came into all among us through the blood cell so therefore Jesus was the created blood of God he will not have to a nap Gentile no race on this earth can claim him as their as as coming from them and Men listen Jesus didn't come from man Jesus came from God and man came from God now so when we look at this Jesus once a creative blood of God now on the cross are you with me now we know we know those elements of the blood they went right back down to the ground and they were probably a sword during the word of the Cross and they're on the De Anza now then well where is the blood that we can go and dub some of it and put on you we don't have it because the power is not in that chemical of the blood is not in the power of of that blood that came down what it was was there was the blood cell and in the blood sellers life and when Jesus died at Calvary out of that blood was released the life of God amen amen remember that would come elements out of his body remember this you were in him when he died at Calvary because the elements of that made his bride was still in him so the water the blood and the spirit was all in him is somebody with me but they're in Calvary the blood cell was broke open and released the life of God the life of the blood remember even in the Old Testament it was freaking don't eat the blood because in there is the life a man in Jesus there in his blood was the life of God and there at the breaking of that blood cell the life of God was released are you with me that life would down'n and defeated hell defeated the grave it rose again man that life raised up his body again I'll send it on high and came again on the day of Pentecost so the atonement was made at the cross where Jesus died but the blood sprinkling came on the day of Pinnacle and they were sprinkled every one of them with the blood the life of God pillar of fire divided itself and each one of them got a lick of the fire of God that made every one of them the blood by the spirit and they were born again not of the will of man nor the will of the flesh but of God and they were ever one born of the blood of God that's how you're born when you're when you're born your new path as a son of God God is your father you're born of his blood you're not only under his blood and your sins atone buys but but you actually become the bud by the baptism of the Holy Ghost dwelling in you amen you have the blood life god they're for your sons and your hairs daughters hey ma'am all that ought to make something any man we're not talking about your human body in your human blood but his royal blood now flows through my veins I'm a son of God his life is in me the power that has in me is not my own but it's his power it's the blood of Christ living out of me you come into his presence now you come boldly into before his throne of grace remember there in the holiest of Holies there was there was some particular things that was in there one day was a pot of manna and my on the outer courts they could go out there and gather manna every way they wanted to be if they kept it over and you know one day to the next it would breed worms and stink but on the on the Sabbath there or the other Sabbath that would come an extra portion and they would take it and they would take it in their home so they would be no gathering on the Sabbath day but then Moses told them go get an owner go get up go get a bunch of this and take it in the holiest of Holies because I want every generation of priests that come into this place that they could go and get some of that original mana and eat some for themselves every month now this is exactly what God did for you and man he made open he opened the veil so you could come into his presence where every one of every generation or you as priests have you got a right to come before the throne of grace come boldly there then every generation hallelujah has a right to go in there and get a bite of that original manner that bread out of heaven are you with me this is what he gave on the day of Pentecost oh man that original mana was that every person can have their own experience with God not you and a priest not you and a password that you and God and God alone and there you go in the presence of God and you get some of that original Pentecostal mana that testifies he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen also that are in the holiest of Holies become a question on the priesthood and the priesthood would be will was who was questioned whether Aaron was truly chosen of God he said I'll tell you what you go get bring Aaron's rod and put it in here bring the others in here and place them also and I'll show you which one is mine or not my choice and he takes of Aaron's there and he put set his staff inside come on puts it inside the wholeness of Holies and it put our almond leaves and bloomed and and and made almonds in the presence of this Shekinah glory amen and when you are chosen of God and brought into that holy place amen if God could take a dead stick a man a dead stick he can take somebody who is dead in his sins and trespasses and bring them into his presence and I'd come into them and they bring forth the fruit of Almighty God hallelujah how does that happen under the [Applause] so you have the right to the very life of God the very power of God the very manner of God dwelling in his presence as the children of the king thus power heads together that the musicians come in the presence of the king God's want to give faith he's won somebody to believe him he's want somebody to move into that element past the human mind plus a human thinking begin to think like God thinks when you go to thinking like God thinks then your problem ain't too hard it ain't too big it ain't too difficult when you think like God thinks when you think as a son of God you look at a mountain to move it but that mountains got
