glad to see nobody had laryngitis everybody recovered from that that was great yes yes sir amen so I want to speak to you tonight again as I've been on this thought on the word we'll bring forth after his kind and I'll just I pray you'll be patient with me we have several more maybe uh sermons along the lines of this but I'm trying to get us to the the service that I spoke about on manifested Sons and we'll get there eventually but I want to look here and I want to also give it a subtitle nothing can separate the seed from the promise now the seed being the thought original thought the promise being the Fulfillment so nothing can separate the original thought from the Fulfillment so I want you to bear that in mind as we speak tonight and we look here God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth God created you to be a ruler to have jurisdiction over animal life and not only over animal life but this animal life and we find that so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them let's look here in Ephesians 1. we're going to look here in verse 4. we'll look at verse 4 and verse 5 then we'll turn to Romans 9 6 to 8. Ephesians 1 and verse 4 says according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame and that word blame there or Without Blame means without blemish as we heard about that on Sunday faultless unblameable before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will notice it's his good pleasure to adopt you to predestinate you to his to his sonship or to sonship look here in Romans 9 and verse 6. Romans 9 and verse 6 not as though the word of God had taken on effect for they are not all Israel which are of Israel neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed God bless you you can have your seats tonight just to kind of look back over our last thought that we spoke we looked at election and we look here in Romans 9 and verse 8 the Bible says for the children not yet being born neither having done good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not a works But A Hymn that calleth and this word election is the act of God's Free Will by which before the foundation of the world he decreed His blessings on certain persons it's the act of picking out our choosing notice it's God's election that we're here tonight it's God's choosing he doesn't choose US based on our abilities or our inabilities he doesn't choose US based on how fit we are our how unfit we are how intelligent we are how unintelligent we can be see God has chosen US based on election and that's God's choosing God's sovereignty on his own and we think about brother bam tells us now he says after the interlude of Destruction the wiping off of The World God excuse me hold on he said God started the people out again he found the man by the name of Abraham his he was his father was Hiram and he come down probably from Babylon he was an idol worshiper from shine already dwelt into child dear the city of Earth and he married his half-sister but notice they came down here and they came into a land and this land was full of all kind of other people and brother bam says Abraham wasn't any better than anyone else but God by Sovereign Grace and election called Abraham according to election that is not a thing that Abraham was any better than anybody else see don't even say he was a Believer but in the beginning God with this unmerited Grace Abraham was saved and Not only was he saved but when God called Abraham he saved him and he gave him his Covenant unconditionally and he says now he says now Abraham is not what certain things that you do it's not Abraham you do this and I'm going to do this he told Abraham it's going to be an unconditional Covenant I've already done it not that you got to read so many scriptures in the morning or or at night losing so many sermons God says I've already done it I've already called you I've already saved you I've already predestinated you I've already elected you already chose you it's not anything that we have to do with it it's God's election and God's grace and he says when you get that thinking thinking that without any marriage without any anything God's covenant was unconditional to Abraham God told him he saved him and not only Abraham but his seed come on sons of God come on seeds of Abraham it wasn't just to Abraham that it was an unconditional Covenant but to you tonight the same Covenant that was bestowed upon Abraham is bestowed upon you tonight and you can't separate the seed from the promise God has given you a promise tonight that you are Sons and Daughters of God he said it in God by solving Grace and election not because that Abraham was was better than anyone else but because God by election for a nation called Abraham Abraham was just an ordinary man just like you and I no supernatural abilities just had enough Faith to believe not Mr America or Mr ciao DIA but he had enough Faith to believe the Bible says that Abraham's staggered not at the promise what about the seeds of Abraham tonight do we look at our wish sons of God that we stagger not at the promise to Caesar Abraham looking at the promised word to be fulfilled not in tomorrow not in yesterday but in our day at this moment this service in our life In This Very event right now God is calling the people that's going to manifest himself and be the bring the Fulfillment to the word to this age and I'm talking to seeds of Abraham tonight and you can't separate that seed from the promise of fulfillment God is going to have sons and daughters notice now he says it's by Sovereign Grace and election not because that Abraham was better than anyone or or was better than anyone else but God by election for nation called Abraham Abraham was just an ordinary man had nothing to do with it neither have you got anything to do with it neither have I got anything to do with it it's God's business to make the choice I say thank you God you made me your choice come on you may be having a rotten day today but thank God you made me your choice you may be down in the MoneyGram today but thank God you made me your choice when I didn't feel like it when I didn't act like it when I've been taught like it God you still made me your choice I say oh blessed be the name of the Lord tonight let you be able to make you look at Monday morning in the face say I got this because my God made me his choice oh my God's bigger than my tomorrow Hallelujah see it's God's business to make the choice not him that willeth or him that running but it's God they showeth mercy and he says all together by election see now God made his Covenant with Abraham absolutely unconditional you know brother Mike I'm glad that that same Covenant applies to me tonight because there's days I don't feel saved but it doesn't do away with the Covenant it doesn't annihilate the promise he doesn't eradicate that I've been called it doesn't stop the fact that I've been chosen by God see because it's an unconditional Covenant there was no ifs ands about it the Covenant was absolutely had no strings attached to it at all and Abraham had nothing to do with it God was so determined that he was going to save Adam's Fallen race and so he made a covenant with Abraham unconditionally not if you'll do something but I have done it Hallelujah what about your sons and your daughters what about those prodigals I have done it come on moms and dads grandparents oh you're worried about the prodigal but God's already said it's an unconditional Covenant to the seeds of Abraham you got to claim them as seeds of Abraham and when you claim them and you believe it for him let me tell you every gun in hell is going to be trained on you but Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief and you couldn't separate the seed from the promised word and you can't separate this bride from the promised word she is gonna come forth this word will be made manifest in her life and in your prodigals not if you do something but I have already done it you know you say well if God will make that Covenant with me the program says he didn't only make it with Abraham but his seed after him oh my god let's help you look at Thursday morning with a bright eye notice you say well I if I was a Jew it doesn't take a Jew outwardly hourly is not a Jew see it's a Jew inwardly for if we are dead in Christ we take on Abraham's seed and notice and we're heirs according to the promise oh don't you just love how God just dovetails it all together heirs and this word air I'll get to it here in just a little bit but just think about it the same way God called Abraham the same way God chose Abraham it's the same way that God called you tonight the same way God chose you tonight look you you got your faults you got your mishaps but yet God called you tonight not by anything that you've done not by how good you are how good looking you are how tall and skinny or short and fat you are it doesn't have any bearings on it at all how much descriptions you read how many sermons you listen to it has no bearing on the fact at all before you was even able to read or write God already called you God already told you God already put your name in the last book of life it's already there it's a finished work Church God's already done it by his election see it's by not what we do but it's what he has already done for us not I'll do something God says I've already done it so a lot of us can make a mess of our own life because we want to take the steering wheel away from God because like hey let me drive let me drive I know your life better than you know your life and every time you take the steering wheel away you end up in a ditch but God says I got it I know the end from the beginning I know hot off I know how it all plans out God knows see we're already called church already Chosen and it's an unconditional Covenant how can you lose how can you lose and we come dragging in I don't know my plate brother Joe how can you lose you're sons of God you're elected of God called of God chosen of God you can't lose no matter how low you get tonight you can't lose because God came loose and you can't separate the seed of God from the promise of the Fulfillment there's no losing to it you've already been declared the Victor church God's already declared I'm going to have a bride with thou spot without wrinkle without blemish oh she's gonna be perfect and I'm gonna bestow upon her all by adoration and all my Splendor and all my praise let me tell you you may not look like it tonight but that's who you are your Road in God's Splendor tonight and we think well I chose God 15 16 says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and I've ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit God is looking for fruit out of your life God is looking for fruit bear the Christian Life bear signs and wonders bear healings and miracles and they're Supernatural not just oh I believe God sent a prophet that's just making an announcement but God is looking for you to bring forth to Bear he has ordained you he's ordained us as his bride to bring forth his life that that seed that was there that he's placed there that thought that God had of you is going to come to manifestation and there's going to be an overcoming life match the word of God now it's going to be a young boy young girls young people in this house that's going to overcome The Temptations of laodicea why because the word has already been declared that he's going to have a bride he's going to have a young person he's going to have a single wife or a single mother he's going to have somebody that's going to rise up in Satan's eating and take God and his word and they're going to become the Fulfillment of that word notice he says you've not chosen me in that word chosen there means to pick out for oneself God chose you for himself he didn't choose you to share you with the Devil you know sometimes two girls can like the same guy and two guys can like the same girl or three or four but not that way with God chose you for himself he's a jealous God he's not sharing you with anybody or anything and so God chose you you didn't choose God and therefore even when you make mistakes you're still chosen you mean brother Joe even when I don't feel like I'm safe you're still chosen even when you hit the bottom of the barrel you're still chosen even with things like your prayers don't go past a roof you're still chosen see it has nothing to do with it you and your mistakes has nothing to do with it all your ups and downs has no bearing on God's choosing he already chose you and declared you to be seeds of God well bam I like the way he says his hearing question his answers 1959 note he said he loved you I say hallelujah come on I need y'all to be working with me this evening now come on this is good stuff I know I've been on it quite a while but let's just get on let's just get behind it look he loved you a Hallelujah he loved you before there was a world he knows your nature Oh you mean God knows my nature yeah he knows it he knows your nature he knows your weakness he knows your habits he knows all about you what you was going to be and then when he looked all over the great Universe he said I Choose You Anyway I said oh blessed be the name of the Lord in my lowest moments God knew my nature and yet he chose me brother Mike God knew the nature I would have he knew the temper I would have he knew the things I would struggle with with my whole weakness and yet God looked all over the great universe and he says I chose you Joe Adams turn your car around get back home go back to the father's house you wasn't meant for the chicken yard but you are meant for my heaven you was meant for a Heavenly place I caused you to be Brian I called you to be chosen elected of God thank you looked all over and he says I chose you oh my I don't know what you're going through today but you're chosen think about it he knowed the nature that you were born with I want to look at this just for a minute because not all of us had the same nature is that all right see God knows how matter of fact you are he knows how temperament or temperamental Moody you are he knows what kind of temper you possess he knows also if you're Meek humble gentle loving caring God knows all that about you see that's your nature that's your Human Nature but I want you to realize God put that in the seed and every seed is going to bring forth of its kind but notice we're not all going to bring forth of the same nature and you look we do I do I'm just going to be honest and transparent man you see somebody like a brother John Andes hope bless God I want to be like that upbeat happy positive all the time man I've tried I fake it till I feel it and I still don't feel it they say fake it till you make it well I'm batting zero brother there there's only one brother John but you see something somebody else and you begin to desire to be like that and again guess what happens you begin to despise who you are you begin to despise the nature in which God has given you but I want you to know tonight in Psalms 139 verse 13 says for thou has possessed my Reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee verse 14. for I am fearfully and wonderfully made oh Hallelujah with that temper you're still fearfully and wonderfully made even with that meekness and that gentleness where people can run ramrod all over you you're still fearfully and wonderfully made and what you find will Satan will anoint that human nature and he'll get you to say things that you wish you would never have said or hurt people that you didn't intend to hurt that's why the Bible says You must be born again so you got to bring that nature that nature you can't do away with that nature God put that nature in the seed it's got a purpose it's going to bring honor it's going to bring glory to God we're in that nature has been brought subject to the word and you take that same nature hot tempered I know none of y'all here got a hot temper no no no none of y'all screw them shoulders back come at me like that not y'all this is even like Tabernacle we're gentle doves but you take somebody's got a fiery nature and a strong disposition and you let them get converted and God begin to anoint that same nature that the devil used to cause hurt and destruction God will anoint that nature and make a prayer Warrior out of them God will make him somebody that he's Relentless in the face of the enemy he's Fearless in the face of devil why because he stands on the same word God put that there to bring glory to himself because it's God's nature God's possessing God bringing forth attributes of himself so don't despise to Nature you have just bring it subject to the word I think I've shared this time or two my mom told me when I was 23 or 21. she said Joe you're going to be in jail or you're going to be in prison that's the same thing you're going to be dead excuse me are you going to be in prison by the time you're 23 years old because of my fiery disposition because I didn't back down but when God got a hold of that life I don't back down off a promise and let me tell you church that same nature don't despise it you're fearfully and wonderfully made God made you in such a way that only you can bring honor from your life and God's not going to share it with anybody or anything now we find here let's keep going on if we don't we okay yeah I got plenty of time says now this these elect are not only the Eternal thoughts of God which were to be expressed in their flesh notice in the flesh in their due season but these same elected are called by another name Romans 4 and verse 16 would tell us therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end that the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only witches of the law but to that which is also the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all Romans 9 and verse 17. neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called see that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed the children of the promise what promise I will have a son let us make man in our image in our likeness God's desire as we heard just briefly again we're going to hear a lot tonight where brother Tim spoke again on Sunday because we're kind of Crossing uh channels here but see God had a desire to have a family and you're that family you're part of it and all your mistakes and all your failures and all your peculiarities and all our corpse and everything that we have to offer God yet God has chosen us and it's that we're the children of the promise because God's promise brother would tell us in Israel in the church number one he said the children of the promise promise what what kind of promise that kind of that God promised before the foundation of the world he called them that's the seed before the foundation when were you chosen oh did y'all not hear that question when were you chosen before the foundation of that was not a trick question I promise you that was hey that's open book before the foundation of the world not because you quit doing this and quit doing that quit lying quit stealing those are just more moral acts well a good citizen will do that you can't tell yourself you're a Christian yet until something here has happened until you've been regenerated something that's happened in here notice Children of the promise promise what that God said I'm going to have a son let us make men in our own image God having Sons and Daughters who would not be conformed to this world but they're going to be transformed by the renewing of their mind when the word comes forth they receive the word and the word begins to work and their mind drops into their heart and life begins to manifest what does it manifest it's manifesting the life that was in the seed the entire time that's why you can believe see the Promise to the seeds of Abraham Brothers tell us now if you and Galatians where he says this in the Smyrna Church age Galatians 3 and verse 29 and if God if you be in Christ then are you Abraham's seed and your heirs according to the promise that word air there means you're a sharer oh Sheriff that means you're an inheritor it means you are a possessor now let's read it like that if you be in Christ then are you Abraham's seed and you're a sharer of the promise you're an inheritor of the promise you're a possessor of the promise if you're Abraham's seed you can't separate the seed from the promise whoo see then here we come into this consolation as the Eternal logos God was manifesting the son and in Jesus throughout all the fullness of the godhead Bali can we say Amen to that and that Eternal one was the father manifesting the Flesh and thereby gained he the title of son but we're not going to finish we're not going to stop reading listen to what he says next even so we Eternal in the thoughts in our turn became the many membered-spoken word see manifest In the Flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest In the Flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become seen by the rebirth we were seed therefore we could be reborn come on Church why are you here tonight they chose that you are sea and he goes on to say in non-seed there is nothing to Quicken see that's the reason why you can catch the word is because you're seed that's why you can believe this message is because you were seed you are seed the reason you stopped drinking and and smoking and partying and living that life that old life is because you are see the reason why you can pack up and leave your family leave your friends leave everything you've ever known and come to a place where they preach the fullness of the word is because you are seed see because in non-seed there's nothing to Quicken so aren't you thankful that that old nature that you had crabby always depressed always down always temperamental aren't you glad it could be reborn oh that was a weak amen for some of y'all my my man I'm so glad I'm so glad none of y'all knew me before I came to this church you will see the a huge contrast brother Mike of what standing before you today versus what I was 20 30 years ago see I'm so glad that old nature no longer has jurisdiction over my life see because I was a seed because you are seen you could be reborn you can you could be quickened because seeing non-seed there's nothing to Quicken see Nazi can dress herself up they can go to church they can sing the same songs they can raise their hands and worship they can Cry tears but in non-seat there's nothing to Quicken and you find Nazis will begin to officially walk out quit coming to church because why there's nothing there to Quicken but in that predestinated sea God put a seed in there a German life and when that life comes in contact with the word oh let me tell you the word begins to respond and that life begins to be quickened by the word of God for the man would tell us the word can only recognize the word why are you here tonight it's not because I'm your favorite preacher no because the word in you has recognized the word for this hour and it responds no matter who's preaching the word in your response to the word of this hour that's why we're here see it can't recognize a denominational or a perversion it knows better it's the word it can only recognize the word a week can only be a wheat oh my see it started off as a wheat it'll always be a wheat it may be a small wheat but it's still a wheat we got a lot of Wheats here tonight cream of the crop not all of us are the same size we but I want you to know right now A Tear can never be a wheat that we're rejoices with the same rain though it lifts His Hands Up In Christ it will never be a week let me tell you always was a wheat you always was a Son of God quit looking back at your past great worrying about yesterday and all your mistakes and look with what God had called you a promise is to be a son A promise is to be a daughter of God A promise is to be that Pride with that spot without wrinkle Without Limits The Promise is to be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye see if we can never be a wheat I'm not calling you a weed so get that out of your head yet it's water by the same anointing but it ain't wheat see God knows exactly where you belong why are you here Why'd You Come From the state of Washington why did you come from the state of Arizona why did you come from the state of Mississippi why'd y'all come from Texas why'd y'all come from Arizona why why did y'all come from Washington because God knows exactly where you need to be for what purpose so that that seed can begin to be nourished built up in the life that was inside of that seed it always was it was always there you didn't get that life at the altar that life was always in the seed oh my you always was you say brother Joe you've been this is part four come on man ain't you got something else to preach I want to preach this so much until you start walking it until you start living it the word will bring forth after his kind what is his kind you ain't some little Castaway some nobody we're Sons and Daughters of a king let me tell you if I negro that slave there if he can conduct himself like a son of a king what about us tonight why don't our sons and daughters of a king we're Sons and Daughters brother Mike are the King of Kings and the Lord of lords it ain't nothing that he won't do for you that God won't reach down and save the time he won't save the love of the hand of God is not short but what it can be it can save it's time we Square our shoulders back don't shed no tear wowzy Wows in me no Square your shoulders back son recognize I always was I always was and you're going to keep hearing until I'm done you always was you always was a seed no matter what happens to you on this side of Eternity you always was you always will be oh your past mistakes doesn't Define who you are your failures doesn't Define who you are your shortcomings they don't Define who you are my God has already defined who you are and it's called your son he's called your pride he's called you elected he's called you anointed he's called you for a body change that's who you are quit looking back at yesterday and look at what the promise says a file that broke out can not only teach it I can I can preach it to you tonight oh I love what he says in first John 3 and verse 1. behold otherwise stop it I want you to look at this for a minute behold God's telling you stop what you're doing allele to see you behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us somebody needs to be waving their hand mama that's me there it is right there the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called sons of God see therefore the world knows us not because it knew him not but see beloved notice verse 2. beloved now come on now not tomorrow not next week not when you get saved not when you get filled with the Holy Ghost but even right now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know I said we know we got a word we got a promise that's declared to us what it will be when we come into the manifestation of sons of God we got a promise and the seed is already there and you can't separate the seed from the promise oh you say brother Joe but you said if we don't have the Holy Ghost yet you're still a son but when you get that Holy Ghost that seed begins to manifest it begins to be quickened she does quickening power in this word there's quickening power in this message you know Jesus has been dead over 2000 years but people are still being changed by this book you know brother Brandon's been off the scene 58 years almost 60 years but yet this message is still transforming Lives why because there's quickening power in the word you know there was a time there was a prophet called Elisha he's done so many miracles and he was one Miracle short of doing Twice The Miracles that Elijah done and he died and he rotted his skin fell off his his bones and they threw him in a grave but one day one day the children was in a battle and they had a man that died and they drug him so far and they finally choked him into the grave and let me tell you they didn't throw him in there long enough because they mean he come up out of the Grave why because they were still quickly in power on those bones what am I telling your church I'm telling you tonight there's quick and Power in this word we're gonna preach quick and Empower we're gonna live by quick and Empower we're going to pray by quick and power we're going to believe by quickly and Power to the devil we're Sons and Daughters of God now so quit putting it off to tomorrow I want you to believe it right now I'm a son of God you may have made some bad mistakes today well screw yourself back get up and do it again now at this present time we are to be expressing the thoughts that God had of us thoughts that originated before the foundation of the world now are we the sons of God quit dwelling on your mistakes well you know brother I come to church and I want to do this and I want to do this and I want to do this and I can't do nothing well that was last week it's a whole different service it's a whole different opportunity just recognize I am what the word says I am I'm a son I'm a seed I'm a thought Eternal thought of God therefore there's not one demonic power in hell there's not one trial there's not one situation there's not one circumstance there's nothing that can separate us from what the promise of God of God the Bible says nothing can separate us from the love of Christ when did Christ love you he loved you and declared that you're going to come forth in your season let me just tell you some of you it's your season quit putting it off quit waiting on special meetings it's your season it's your season to believe the word it's your season of belief for your children it's your season of belief for your health this is your season this is your season for the supernatural this is your season for the Holy Ghost this is your season to see the altar full of people weeping and and wailing people crying out to God this is our season even like Tabernacle don't push it off to tomorrow right now we are the sons of God your yesterday is not going to Define who you are tomorrow the choice you made from this night the choices you made from right now will be reigning over you over you over here the clarity yes you are Son of God quit living below your god-given privileges God's called you for this see your past has no control over your future once you've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost your past doesn't have to Define you God's already to find who you are God's already put his stamp upon you you're sealed until the day of your Redemption all Church don't worry about worry about committing adultery Spiritual Authority that that seed has already been dramatized by The Word of Life there ain't nothing from the world can get in there if you truly been born again notice now Bob says the believer can't say no no you know we we think about this for a minute and we think about well you know bro Joe I got mistakes and I got failures and you know there's not I don't do everything right nobody said Amen to that one did they you know we're going to make mistakes we're not going to do it willfully but you're going to make mistakes even being filled with the Holy Ghost you're going to do things that if you're not careful would be considered sinful but the Bible tells us in First John 3 and verse 9 whosoever is born of God do us not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him he cannot sin because he is born of God you don't commit sin you make a mistake you fall you come short of the glory of God but you get back up you're quick to repent he said father I'm sorry I did that and you call that person on the phone he said I'm sorry I said that I'm sorry acting like that I'm sorry I made that bad business decision I'll make those things right it won't hold over you you cannot sin because the seed of God remains inside of you brother them tells us in Hebrews chapter 7 he said the believer can't sin certainly not the seed of God the blessing of God remains on him see God can't see nothing but the blood of his own son no matter what it is in the church what it is God don't see it because Jesus is making intercessions constantly the high priest no way for him to sin when such a sacrifice is laying there for him like that now I'm not giving you a a privilege to go out live any way you want I'm not saying that at all but I'm saying a Son of God a real born again son and daughter of God they don't commit it they don't willfully go looking for sin their minds are not willfully going to that that internet site and clicking on and doing they may get trapped but they're not willfully doing it because the brother says if you're willfully doing it then you ain't been changed yet so let's make sure we draw that but the Bible says once purged by the blood they remaineth no more desire see because there's a seed on the inside and that seed is declaring you different than the world you know how many of you when you were young children maybe Elementary School and kids will do things and you couldn't do it because it just bothered you only two three of us okay well maybe we'll have a meeting when we're done but you know there's things other people could do but you couldn't do brother bam said because that life that germ was always there it wouldn't even allow you as a child to do things that others were doing I wish it would have kept me from a lot of the things that I did but praise God had kept me from doing a lot of things that I didn't do because the seed was already was there but sometimes I walked over it sometimes you walked over it sometimes you were going to do what you want to do but it's because you were going to be the man of your own ship oh but there's a captain there's a captain when you realize you're tired of running that ship of ground Lord get me out into some deep seas and let's set sail I thank God for that tonight notice now he says now then after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this and that and you went from the nomination to the nomination but one day you being a part of God you had to be a part of the word and when you heard the word you know where you come from you know what the truth you always notice that you were always deceit was always in you the words seemed the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you come to it brother Johnny the word was always there now I know a little bit you told us your testimony many years ago about the life that you live but there was the word was always there and when that word that was here came to the word that was there you that word came to that word and now you don't live the life that you used to live can I get a witness somebody oh I can declare it to you brother help maybe the same thing for you tonight when that word came to this word this word came to that word no longer we can't be Earthbound chickens going around clucking around in denominational pest house no why because we've heard from our mama bird we've heard from Mama Eagle Church we're not Earthbound chickens we're Eagles we're Sons and Daughters of God God has got great things in store for us so you think about that eagle clucking around on that chicken yard all that manure and all that chicken poop and chicken isn't chicken there you ever get around a bunch of chickens all that Bob brother Aaron does a great job of being a chicken Eagle don't make that kind of racket they got a nice Eagle scream about them I'm not even gonna do it because I'll embarrass myself but it ain't some just picking around with their head just moping around no that eagle realized you know what these things don't look like me I mean look I got a pretty white head I got some nice big long wings I got some beautiful feathers that little chicken over there ain't got the little video wings and just barking around big big and if his brother started bleeding they'd go start pecking on his brother Eagle don't start pecking on another eagle no what does another Eagle do when that eagle finds himself in trouble oh another Eagle they begin to throw down fresh meat they begin to throw down fresh worm they say you can do it that's who you are you're not Earthbound God called Hallelujah God called you I find the heavenlies oh we the Eagles Church we encourage one another we don't we don't persecute one another but we encourage them get up from there cause called you in this hour God's anointed you in this hour we received the mighty message think you can stay home and be strong be an eagle chicken stay home I know this may hurt some of you but oh well you came to the wrong service this word this lie this has to be your life it can't be optional did you hear what I said it can't be optional well if I don't have no work I'm going to church on Wednesday night it ain't about whether you got work or no work it means you're going to quit at 4 30. Jack your sorry hi to the house of God and be changed by the word you make this word a priority because he made you a priority he chose you but for the foundation of the world you ain't gonna make it to the other side hop skipping and Skip jumping and whatever you're trying to do showing up every once in a while your church or tennis is 15 percent I don't care how good your heart is from the abundance of the mouth speak at the heart say what you want to say put your body in that pew that's telling the story your family needs it you need it your kids need it I don't know why I'm here it's not in my notes but I'm telling you tonight you need it you need it we need it we need it we need we need to hear that we're sons of God we need to hear that we're Eagles we need to hear that we're not earth pound chickens we need to hear the word they're not denominational Believers we need to hear that from before the foundation of the world I always was a son of God and if you always was then start acting like it tonight Stephen like it tonight start believing like it tonight start singing like it start rejoicing like start praising God I am a son I've been called from this world God's call me God's call me for something great I may not know what it is I may not have it all figured out but I know one thing when he shall appear I'm gonna be just like him cause I am Made In His Image that's the word that's the promise and you can't separate the seed from the promise can I go just a few more minutes Church program says death does not even stop the quickening power death can't stop it because when you got it it's eternal see there's the difference when you got it not when you talk about it no not when you act like you got it but when you truly got it it's eternal you begin to line up with a message he begin to line up with the word why because you've heard from your theophany I'm going to tell you again you always was a son I got part five and part six with waiting in the wings guess what you're gonna hear guess what you're gonna I bet you can't guess it that you always was a son of God you know I'm gonna keep preaching some of y'all gonna go out here you go like you know what I really believe what bro Joe's preaching you know I'm gonna start acting like a real Son of God I'm gonna get my family to the house of God on Sundays and Wednesdays now and if we got special means we'll be at those special meetings cause why you just need to be told you just need to be encouraged you just need to keep hearing it and keep hearing it and then finally something drops down and you start really believing I am what the word says I am now because brother Joe said it but because the word has already declared it I am a Son of God I always was a Son of God I made in this image I formed in this like this oh Hallelujah church that's who I am then you'll get your head out of them nasty programs then you'll get your eyes off those dirty websites then you'll start treating your wife like she needs to be treated oh and you'll treat your husband like he's the king of the house oh then you quit looking over your shoulder worried about yesterday's mistakes and you square them shoulders back come on devil I was born for this purpose this is who I am that nature that disposition quit letting the devil anoint it bring it subject to the word and let God bring Glory from your life let God bring honor he put it there to bring himself honor you know what we're all are not alike news flash right news flash oh I wish I could be like some of y'all but I can't but who I am I want to be the best who I am I can be he said bro Joe you you mean you got to work at that that means I got to bring myself subject to it means I got to get into the word daily I got to pray I got to have a prayer life I got to have a time of devotion with God so that I can know who I am and when you know who you are then you know who you are not and I'm trying to declare it to you tonight who you are not you always was you all with brother man says when Paul this great Theologian when he came face to face with the word Jesus quickened it he quickened this seed that was in Paul's like a man who persecuted the church see your past has no bearing over your future he was always a son and he was always a prophet he was always the first church age messenger though he did things you don't think the devil reminded him of Stephen when he stood there and watched this saintly Son of God be stoned to dead for a stand probably wasn't a day that Paul didn't go by for what the devil reminded him look what you did you allowed this you instigated this but Paul said I bring my body under subjection daily to not let my past Define my tomorrow I'm recognizing who I am and I'm also recognizing who I am not I recognize who I belong to and I also recognize who I don't belong to see Titus 2 and verse 13 my I got so much here I might have to have part eight let's go to Colossians 1 and verse 21. and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled that's everybody in this room tonight now hath he reconciled we were alienated we were aliens in our minds by Wicked Works evil desires the first nature or that nature that was unconverted well yet once that nature comes on subject to the word reconciled to God God can make a glorious Redemption out of it and use it for his honor look at Paul Paul's temperament somebody like Paul he persecuted the church so for uh so vigorously And yet when it came time to establish the Church of God man Paul reared them shoulders back and he was relentless he went through shipwrecks he went through scourges he went through this he went through that he went through it all but he declared the name of Jesus see the nature was always there but he just had to get it converted had to get it under subject to the word program says now notice redeem needs to buy back see it restores to the original owner God by his death the shed Blood Bought back his son he bought back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice the word and they follow me you always were a sheep you never were a pig you never was a dog turned into a sheep you always was a sheep so quit going around identifying as a pig we got kids so they they can identify as cats and dogs in school go send them a little tray over there in the corner and they can go do their business they're a cat give them some kitty litter and Satan will want nothing more than sheep sons of God to go and identify themselves for something that you are not and I'm here to tell you I'm going to keep preaching until you really believe it you are sons of God let that be your identification put the token on display your shoulders back it's time to believe it's time to have faith time to rise up program said it's not the person that comes predestinated from God but it's the word or the seed that is it now let's go on down so I can try to wrap this up I'm gonna just cut it short sorry Church the Bible tells us in Romans 8 and verse 20 verse 29 for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn of my many brother moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called those he called he justified to whom he justified them he also glorified see those that God had for knowledge of he predestinated that word for knowledge means God had a relationship with you you were in his thinking in his thought process so that takes us back to Genesis 20 20 Genesis 1 26 let us make man in our image and our likeness see we're predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son I want you to believe it I want you to believe it that's who you are that should be your aspiration I'm gonna match that word that word before you go to bed at night you get on your knees and you pray to God God I want to match that word when you get up in the morning before that footsteps off that bed God let this be the day that I match that word Let There Be overcoming quickening power Supernatural Revelation strike me today let me live as a son of God that I can declare and manifest you to a dying generation notice what he says now oh my church he goes many are called but few are chosen and you are chosen and you were chosen and you were chosen and you were chosen many are called but few are chosen see the difference chosen the word means for God's Own purpose God chose you because you are the ones he's making his family with no matter what nationality or authenticity whatever it may be that we come from whether we're black yellow blue green it doesn't matter to God already saw us and he put us in his great bouquet with all our peculiarities and natures and he says that is going to be my family that and when one flower starts to wilt there's going to be others there to encourage it see God's Got Confidence in the seed that he put inside of you sometimes you don't have confidence in yourself but God does like brother Timothy spoke the other night God is faithful when we're not faithful thank God that God is let me say this thank God we have a church family that'll rally we're around you thank God you got Ministry they won't tell you what you want to hear but they'll tell you what you need to hear we can preach you up in the Heights some of us can brother Tim some of them they can preach you up into the heights of this word some of them can preach you right where you're living see because he told he told Peter Peter do you love me yes Lord you know I love it then feed my sheep Peter do you love me yes Lord then feed my Lambs see you got to feed it all eat a light Tabernacle we can feed you all it's not us but it's because we're staying in the word of God to show you who you are to my brother Tim said on Sunday to put that Perfect Bride without spot for that wrinkle without blemish put that before you preach it before you take that other one and say put it right beside it you always was a Son of God I created you in my image the Bible says you're fearfully and wonderfully made put it back there and you marry the two of them up and he says now you start walking to that start walking into that that's why a young man can turn his head and turn his head walking through laodicea with all the smut and everything around they'll keep their eyes focused on the cross they're not going to look this way or look that way they're looking toward the promise of God let me tell you Church the same way with us tonight you're not looking at these things of the world it's the things of the world are pulling on you something hadn't happened yet you need to get that thing taken care of and get it to the Altar and let God burn it out of your life but what I'm telling you tonight is you put that body you put that Revelation you put that image right in front of you and you begin to walk into it yes I am a Son of God yes I am that bride yes that's who I am I may not look like it tonight I may have failures tonight but that's the word of God I always was the word of God and I'm bringing this to a close here in a few minutes but now he's standing in the midst of the church this is the level to see a message he stands there revealing who he is in the last stage he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is not another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church Colossians 1 8 he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning of the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence second Corinthians 5 17 therefore If any man is in Christ he is a new creation you can't be new with the old habits you can't be new and have old desires you can't be new and you can't get to the house of God we're talking about a new creation notice now old things have passed away old desires old habits old longings old nature had passed away and behold All Things become new Ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship created in Union with Christ unto good works Ephesians 4 24 and that you put on the new man put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness program says now the new creation is not the old creation made over he cannot be called because it's a new creation that's exactly what it says it's a new creation it's another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing with the ways of the flesh see but now out of every Kindred tribe people and Nation he has purposed a new creation got his purpose a new creation this is a true revelation of God this was his purpose this purpose took form through election that is why he could look right down to the last age when all the world would be over or all would be over and he can see himself standing in the midst of the church as the author of the new creation of God God says let us make man in our image in the beginning and now we find him in our day walking in the midst of his creation see before there was a world ever started God saw us and God put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life he said that name is there and there ain't a devil in hell can touch it because you always were indelible there ain't nothing that you'll go through that'll ever erase your name off of that book did you hear me the seed cannot be separated from the promise the sea cannot be separated it was God's purpose to bring forth the people like unto himself that would be a bride oh my he says remember brother man tells you I no longer call you Church but I call you a bride what a distinction he's separating you from the rest because he's showing that you were never part of the church but you always was the bride see she was chosen before the foundational World in him she was foreknown beloved before she she ever was brought forth during the ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed by his blood and can never never come under condemnation some of y'all need to shout because you walking in condemnation day after day after day after day but the Bible says therefore there is now no condemnation to them that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit you know the emphatic diet Glide brother brother Bram talked about that and brother Tim made mention to it on Sunday but when you look at the emphatic dog and you look at Romans 8 it says because whom he foreknow also before he marked out copies God already marked out copies of himself and I'm looking at at marked out copies you know you take a sheet of paper and you're gonna or a cloth and you cut a design out of it God said you know what I'm going to replicate that I'm going to have sons and daughters in my own image he didn't take another sheet he didn't take another piece of cloth he took of the same cloth and he took the same pattern he took the same as I and he began begin to cut out of it the same thing church I'm here to tell you you're made from the same call that Christ is made from you're exactly the same you're marked out copies of God himself I mean that's why you're here tonight that's why you come to receive the word tonight it's because God had already called you for this he mocked you out you don't belong to the devil you belong to God oh and I meant that here musicians please come if you would Romans 8 and verse 31 what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us oh he that spare not his son but delivered them up for us all how that he was how that he shall not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justified is he that condemneth it is Christ that has died rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who maketh intercession for us verse 35 and this is where we draw our thought who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation that's a question shall tribulation shall distress shall persecution shall famine or nakedness our Peril our sword oh Church the Bible says who shall separate us from the love of God there's nothing and we find in verse 38 he says for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Jesus Christ Our Lord I'm going to tell you tonight this word is going to bring forth of his own kind and the seed of God there is nothing that can separate that seed from the word from the promise there ain't no persecution there ain't a sickness there ain't cancer ain't enough demon power ain't enough depression ain't enough anxiety ain't enough fear ain't enough heart trouble ain't enough sugar diabetes there ain't nothing can separate the seed from the promise your sons of God your daughters of God Rejoice Church rejoicing that revelation God you call me for this you made me dust [Applause] I didn't make myself the bride God you called me you made me and there ain't enough there ain't enough powers that can separate me from my promise oh but love it what manner of love the father has bestowed upon me that right now right now on a Wednesday night I'm a son of God and when I get out of bed on Thursday morning I'm a Son of God and when I get to Monday I'm still a Son of God and when I get to next year I'm still a Son of God and when I face my hardest trial I'm still a Son of God and when sickness ravishes my body I'm still a Son of God and when I feel like giving up and giving it I can't give up I came back up I can't give in why because I am a Son of God and it does yet appear what I shall be but I know one thing what he shall appear buddy I'm gonna be just like him I'm gonna be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye Oh Glory to God's Satan you don't have enough to keep this little bride down we've been made in the image of God and this word is going to come forth let me just share one last quote he called by elections he set his church in order Jesus said no man can come to me except the father draws him you never come to God because that you wanted to you come because Christ called you God called you and he that comes to me I will know why is cast out I will give him everlasting life not just lasting from one week one Revival to the another but Everlasting eternal life I will raise him up in the last day he said oh my if that doesn't just take the wind out of Satan's cells I don't know what does to realize God called you and if
