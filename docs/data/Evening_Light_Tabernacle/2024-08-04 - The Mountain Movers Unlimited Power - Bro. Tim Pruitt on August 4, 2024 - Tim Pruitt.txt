Everlasting amen let's bow our heads together today as We Worship the Lord together just let him speak to you in a special way today Father we are your children and we have gathered in your name we know Lord that when we do this oh God you are here in our midst your word declares it and we believe your Word of Promise we're asking your blessings upon us today Lord in your presence that you'll just come speak to Hearts let them realize the love of God has been shed abroad in their hearts Lord and because of this we love one another and we want to thank thank you for every person that is here today and those that's under the sound of my voice wherever they are around the world assembled with us today or maybe in the days or weeks or months or even years later that they may hear this may they know Lord you are in our midst and you're doing great things we are the people upon whom the end of the world has come and Lord we are here and know and can testify that you are here with us even in us to the end of the world I pray Lord you'll anoint your word today May it go forth in power Lord may you just move back every evil spirit everything that would hinder and let the word flow I'm looking to you today for the anointing Lord I I'm stepping into uh the the realm where that I move into and yield my gift to you and I'm ask asking now father that you'll just move me out and step in and I can just be an oracle of God that can speak your word that you'll speak through this and today it'll be more than just a lecture just more than a some type of teaching or something but it'll be absolutely prophesying because God is speaking through a human vessel I ask Lord that you would hear through the ear may they hear what the spirit is say saying to the church we are yours Lord we thank you for your comfort for your strength for your help and Lord we are asking your blessing bless Lord bless our brother Timothy as he's ministering away today in Arkansas may you bless that congregation with a mighty outpouring of your spirit we pray in Jesus name amen amen God bless you I'm going to have you be seated just for a moment and if you can just wait one minute please I want to First Begin by saying thank you for the great outpouring of love that you showed to The Adams Family this week and um I uh you know just um um was so appreciative of everything that you did um the uh attendance you know of course course you know as I do that um moments like those are difficult they're difficult for the family they're difficult for us all but um you know together we we draw together and give support and give strength and you know uh you know even when they don't have any strength others don't have any strength we lend them our strength we surround them we encourage them we help them and you couldn't make me more prouder than what you did um uh this this week and uh with the outpour of love the meal that you provided this support for the family your attendance at the services the graveside the the memorial service this is very important um and um you you showed Christ in that also the outpouring of love that you shown from evening light Tabernacle we have um collected just from the church here about $25,000 to help in in their time of need you know um they uh I Converse back and forth with the GoFundMe uh situation of course you know it's better to give it directly to church than through GoFundMe because they take 3% or so and um here we they get it all you know just directly handed you can actually get a tax donation by writing it out to the church and and then we write a check out to her to to sister Beth and so you know um it it's a it works better for you as a church member or even some of those that are listening out there that want to give a contribution now listen you know the the Bible said that pure religion you know is actually showing support for the the widows and and the uh fatherless and so this is this is part of our our religious duty to help out in serious needs and situations like this and you have risen to the task and I want to thank you for it and express my appreciation now like I said about to go fundme I uh Converse back and forth with different ones and I set a goal for $85,000 on that and and you say well why brother Tim I I tell you we got about a we got about a $68,000 mortgage that I've got I I I want to see paid off and um you know where that that family can live free and clear without that worry and uh I believe that we can provide that I believe that God will provide it amen and so you know um I if you look around and just look at our building that we have here then I want you to think of the the um the youth facility that we have it's a beautiful facility for the young people I'm going to be meeting with them in a in a few weeks there and and then look behind us and over here we have um the the hope of bilon that was provided everything that you see on this 40 acre campus is totally paid for we've never owed a dime on it you know why that is is because God is Jehovah Gyra he is more than enough and he is able to provide now you know I did that without begging for money without um you know without taking pledges without asking you to you know somehow or another give so much a month we didn't do any of that you know God provided it put it in my hands and and and God took care of it and I I believe that God will do the same in this kind of situation right here so my faith is big and I'm looking to a big God Amen who has more than enough so I'm just um speaking that this morning amen across the the waves you know um we we got a need our brother Tony Adams he was um precious brother I remember you know him in his very early days when you know he didn't have any nickel to rub between his his fingers it all and just a single boy and just out of sin and you know still had some of the the effects of that that was lingering on and then you know he got stabilized and God gave him a wife wife and and then five children and and um now so soon he's taken from us but you know we're here and we're family and we're here to be their support and I want you to I want sister Beth to know we have your back we have you we are here for you and we love you and and the whole family and our hearts are hurting with you today as you go through this time but at the same time we realize this is part of life every person that is born into this world has got an exit from it and so there will be an exit for you one day I don't know I would hope it would be by the Rapture the change of the body that's the that's the hope for us all but until that time you know well we will see ones like this that will depart from us but anyway you know uh with that said I am going to move on to some more happy things and and more uh joyous things and even though I'm rejoicing over you know the many of the things that have God has blessed us with here because it's h absolutely the blessings of God already pouring out upon this family and our church here so but we got to you know as life changes and things goes and you know chapters turn in our life and and decisions are made there can be some very wonderful things happen and we got a couple today that I want to recognize that have decided to get married and they're going to be engaged and they are announcing their engagement today I want them to come down here brother Silas green sister Lily Paris will you give them a hand as they come God bless you I'm so proud of I'm so proud of these young people they're they're my they're my children I tell you I I love them and uh you know come here I tell you what they have been such a blessing to me already the other day they came and and uh spent some time with me brought prepared a meal and brought it to me and hint hint and you know they just um they're just a fine young couple there that have made this choice in life and I think it's it's so such a wonderful thing I think when God looks on it he just Smiles because he remembers that he's got a wedding plan too a marriage supper in the sky that we're all going to and this is only reflecting something that will come for us all when we'll be United together will you bow with me father today I want to say thank you thank you for Silas Lord we remember him struggling in darkness we remember we remember Lord how our hearts beat and prayed God save that boy and we seen you to of Glorious salvation in his life Lord we remember Lily wondering confused needing needing God in her life and you've done such something so wonderful for her here I'm taking your son and your daughter today and laying my hands on them and blessing them in your name Lord for the engagement now and the marriage ahead whenever it will be sometimes in the fall Lord whenever whatever date th knowest we just pray Lord you'll watch over and protect them let them walk in the love of God May their families surround them and support them and encourage them and the church family and they always do that which is right in your sight as they have made pledges to each other already and Lord these pledges are so important we don't take them fre privilously we realize their value and we ask Lord now as they look toward that day where they will stand at the altar and be formally United in marriage Lord that you'll watch over and keep them and bless them may they grow in you Lord be encouraged in Christ until that day you come for us in Jesus name amen God bless you love you congratulations amen bind us together Lord bind us together with course that cannot be brok bind us together Lord bind us together bind us to together with love amen if you'll stand with me we'll turn to St John chapter 15 and verse 7 St John 15 and verse 7 these are the words of Jesus and he says if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you and then let's back up a chapter to verse 12 of chapter 14 and let's read this verily verily I say unto you this is this is not a stammer he's not stuttering he's emphasizing it's surely surely or absolutely absolutely it's it's where he says the word double time he's doubling down on this promise he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall ye he do because I go to my father God bless you can be seated now today as we just look to the Lord for his anointing and his Spirit to be Upon Our Lives today and and I and I just want to I just want to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit and just kind of follow his leadership as we as we um approach this subject and look into these things you know because I don't want it to be so mechanical but I want it to be where the spirit of God is is can use us and speak through us today to you but in doing so I I want to just remind you of some of the things that we have been speaking on as we have been speaking of the mountain movers today we're going to be speaking on the unlimited power and and I want to remind you that we originally were made for Dominion but through the fall and and brother Bram told us is um and I quote this get a lot of this from the sermon the found fundamental foundation for for Faith and and in there brother Brandon would tell us that it's like the plumbing as it was in our brain or the outlet where Faith was to flow through has been clogged up and he said even even now it gets clogged up with business Affairs or with home life or domestic things or it gets clogged up even with theology or you know wrong teaching that we've had in the past or maybe as we have been going through it what the crowd is saying and and so it gets clogged up until God cannot operate through those channels that he made man for and and so we know when God made us he made us um as we are wonderfully beautifully and wonderfully made by God he made it wherever part is a part to play and whether it be your teeth or your eyes or your nose or your ears you know God has got a purpose for every part of it you know and he was he did everything in Perfection to make man where he could live and operate here upon the Earth so we know then if God would be so meticulous in how he designed the human body then we know that he would also be very meticulous in the way that he designs his body the church and so again we realize that when when he does this if he designed us uh designs his body he designed us that we can come together in a Heavenly atmosphere and have the supernatural workings of God and where that his um his his utterance such as prophecy or his wisdom which is a gift of his or his knowledge which is again the gift of knowledge the word of knowledge is is also another gift and Gifts of healing all these other gifts they are to be Outlets where God displays his power and lets out his Revelation to the church so now of course this is not one individually of course having everything but we are just cells of one body and that body is the Church of Jesus Christ the bride of Christ so now we we look and we see in Fallen man in his Fallen condition we see that operating within our being is the laws of sin and death that is um that that we are now in that realm of where our body came because of sin it came because of the fall and we're in as it was a hybrid condition because we were originally not to be brought by by sexual birth but we were to be bought by the supernatural by the spoken word of course you know when we are born again according to Peter he said you are born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible seed of the word of God that liveth and abideth forever so every new birth is a birth from the spoken word of God and brother bandam tells us in spoken words Original Seed he says that you know be being that you were born of the spoken word of God you are birthed by like you should have been at the beginning so you know you bypass that and you lost that opportunity to be born from the hand of God to come through the sexual birth and to have to live here dominated by sin and and and sickness can come and rain in your body and because of that the law of Satan rules over your body and and here you come and you have heartaches and and you you know you Satan will send cancer and and your man recognize that Satan sends heartaches and we recognize it and we receive it so if Satan and by his power can make his laws work within man the law of sin and death then how much more should god with his power make the law of spirit and life work within man so you see you see if we if we can just if we can just tap in and work according to the laws of God then among his people will be recognized Divine Healing revelation power gifts manifestations of the Spirit of God now so you see again you know the law of the liberty of Christ has come to set us free from the law of sin and death now that is already taking place within your soul God has begun from the inside out and when he does he claims your body for the resurrection every person who is filled with the Holy Ghost will r eyes in the resurrection or they will if they're living they will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye but we're as brother bandam said it and I want to quote this verbatim he said I believe this with all my heart I believe we're nearing the age that when people are going to recognize those things that we've had so much vain philosophy and so forth and teachings that ought not to be until it set the human mind to Revolution of thinking on matters of this and that and taking it away from the word of God and he said if we could just throw ourselves completely to God and to his will and be lost to our own thoughts and just let the mind of Christ be in us then them operations of the spirit would work just the same as Natural Things does Amen so Jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will you see God and His word are inseparable amen you cannot you cannot truly have the word without having the spirit and you cannot have the spirit without having the word you see because God is the word and God is the spirit and God's spir word is spirit and Truth now so you you see you cannot have god without having his word and when you have his word you have God so I tell you if there was ever people that ought to have a lot of God it is a people whom the word has been restored to but now you can have theology without having God but if it's truly the word it will contain not just the knowledge of truth but the spirit of truth I want you to remember truth is a Spirit he said when the spirit of Truth has come he will lead you and guide you into all truth so it's called the the holy spirit is called Spirit of Truth so now again we we want to realize that when you really have the word you will receive the spirit with it now of course you know because of sin we were in our first birth we we are born we were born defeated and we were born with our our power lines clog the communication between us and God the flow of Heaven back down to earth and and so again we we come back to a place in our new birth that we realize uh a confidence in God that whatever we get what we ask for because God cannot take back his word and he has to stay with his word and but of course that is all going to be dependent upon working upon with the laws of God now again we we were made for that purpose we were made to have dominion but through the fall it was taken away from us but Redemption is brought back again now so brother bradam tells us that the only thing that hinders us as a human race today from being Superior and controlling like they did in the beginning is because the power lines of the outlet of God made in the human being has been clogged up so then he said sometimes Theology and church doctrines have clogged up your faith line clogged up your lines until you you have been taught things that those things can't be and that puts a block in the way so again it is hearing from the crowd now you know Jesus became us so that we might be conformed to his image is that right to bring many Brethren and also that we can have his mind amen I mean it's been prophesied of you that the bride will do only his will that they have the mind of Christ and they know what he wants done with his word right yes sir now you know again we know God became flesh to make all of this possible amen the word became flesh the word actually was made a human being and and there's where God became a Kinsman he he through death he came so that we could have his life he became a sinner that we might become his righteousness now let me clarify that because we know Jesus did not sin but he took on your sins amen so again he became poor that through his poverty I might become rich amen so you see he became what I was so that I might through his grace become what he is so you then you talk about the powers of God because if that's true then the power LS within the Believers now again you see the church the Gentile church was never to be a servant they are called Sons and Daughters that's what they are you know Israel was God's servants but the but here the bride of Christ is his children so you see you're we must get away from the SL slave mentality amen we were not when we're born again we were not born slaves when we born first we were born a slave to sin we were born a slave to the devil we obeyed the lust of our flesh amen but no longer are we slaves we died to that old life and we're born again new and we're no longer slaves I'm not a slave to sin I'm not a slave to his unbelief I'm not a slave to the works of the devil amen I am a child of God now so we must understand who we are and our position in Christ now I want you to look we'll just digress a moment and just say originally there was no confusion for example in the New Birth and the placing of sons in the New Testament I mean everybody knew that when you received the Holy Ghost you receive power you had adoption robe upon you you you operated as a son you had the Ring of authority you you walked out with Peter and John and said Silver and Gold Have I None but what I've got I give to you that's I have something I have dominion amen I I I'm a son I've been born a son I mean this is right after the upper room experience oh yes wasn't years and years and years and years and years of endless growth and what day I'm going to be on no sir no sir it wasn't when they were filled with the Holy Ghost they were equipped with Power Authority hey amen now the confusion only came because of the process of in which it was restored for example you know Catholicism had taken the original experience of being born again and reduced it to being saved because you were born into a Catholic Family so you're automatically you were Christian at Birth you know and from there you're baptized into the church you're born again there therefore you were a Christian you were saved and through works and Penance you work out your salvation and one day if you're good enough it'll be confirmed over in glory but right now you really don't even know what a mess the church was in and you know there was a um a a priest his name was Luther and he had access to a Bible because everybody else didn't that's right so you know there in the monastery he had actually access to a Bible that others didn't have and he happened to read in the Bible one day that the just shall live by faith and when he did you know he he realized then salvation wasn't because of works or being born but was by faith in Jesus Christ and and then I kind here it it goes along for a while you know and okay you know um and and this is everybody say okay well then you're saved when you believe you're saved when this this is the infilling of the Holy Ghost when I believed I I I I was justified and Wesley come along and read it and he concluded that forgiveness of sins was necessary and something but something had to be done about Christians living a sinful life all the while they were claiming to be forgiven and and they would yet they were still living and doing and having Vice and sin in their lives and so he come along and he taught well you not only must have forgiveness you need a sanctification be holy as I'm holy that's what God Said right so he began to preach Holiness and he began to say there's got to be a work of cleansing and this would come with with with actually a demonstration of power they would fall out under it and they would actually the old Shad methodists they they would uh revive them with a bucket of water throw it in their face and get them up and you know uh because um you know they were so overcome as that experience of sanctification where he Sanctified their lives and they were cleanse the vices and sin that had held them down then the isus of Pentecost came along and said yes righteousness is imputed through forgiveness of sins and you must surely be Sanctified from Evil and his habits but you also be must be anointed or baptized by the spirit and have its gifts and so they spoke in tongues and prophesied and they were real and it was the Holy Ghost amen it was it it was the spirit with his anointing coming in and and here they would speak in tongues and prophesy and so on but you know again again as we come down to this we want to bring it right back down to where we're at because the message comes along to bring us back to what the apostles had what was lost and the apostles had a Justified life a Sanctified life an anointed life but they were also placed with the token the literal Life of Christ Christ where you are sealed to the day of redemption and by receiving the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost like the apostles had it makes us children of God and places us with full Authority as Sons amen and you tell a Son of God or a child of God something from the Bible and they'll just believe it amen but you know we're still human and we we deal with where Satan comes with his laws and our body you know accepts cancer and it accepts this and it accepts that and all kinds of other things and when we get in a crisis we often forget who we are and we will allow the crisis and the unbelief of the crowd and even things that even science will say or whatever doctors will say or whatever you know or or maybe things that somebody else did and they prayed and they failed and and we will allow it to clog the communication and the flow of the spirit now but but as sons of God you are co-equal or coair with Jesus Christ now I want you to read it in the Bible Romans 8:16 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God listen when when the Holy Ghost comes upon you is God bearing witness you're his child amen now when you make a profession in Jesus Christ you're saying he's your savior but when you get the Holy Ghost he's saying you're my child you see one you're making a claim on God two it's him making a claim on you he is say this is what he did at the River Jordan he said this is my beloved Son in whom I please to [Music] dwell right that's what happened on the River Jordan is the spirit beared witness that's my son this is the son of love and when the Holy Ghost comes upon you it is God bearing witness that you are his child and then so now if we are children then that gives us certain benefits then we are hires and we're Heirs of God and join airs with Christ which means we are co-equal with him amen if if so be that we suffer with him we may also be glorified together now this is what makes the devil angry that's right and this is what raises the hair on the devil and his hackles comes up and he comes and attacks and snarls and you even get it from pulpits across the world is when you start telling people who they are and who we are in Christ and what God has promised and stand for what that and declare it as true then they side with the crowd and want to Stone you but if if the Church of the Living God that has claimed to have kissed the blessings off the realm of the cup if God could just take this gospel and Shake us to the place until we realize who we are and what our rights are are God given Privileges and that's what I want to talk about this morning is to help you to remember who you are because this age deals with a horrible disease that once attack us all and it's called spiritual Amnesia right and you've never seen it even it's something in the spiritual real what you're seeing in the natural is not natural it's actually spiritual when you see boys that don't know whether they're boys and they think they're girls that's Amnesia when you see girls who want to be boys and try to think they're boys and can fight like boys and all of that that's Amnesia there's something seriously wrong and you don't understand you think it's a physical thing it's not physical at all yes it's manifested in physical but it's a spiritual problem and and let me just tell you you know we can we can take a girl dress Her Like a Lady and with long hair and and you know just dress her like a lady with a nice dress but if you don't ever get the spirit changed you still got a dominating female in a dress amen you still got masculinity and a masculine spirit in this from the spirit realm trying to take with confusion and perversion and the same thing with a man that won't take his place and his position in Christ and won to allow Christ to be the head of him amen and and so he can be the head of the home because I know you know woman you listen to what I say let let me just tell you man come under the Dominion of Christ first you know I I don't know some of you want to scream at some of these young ladies and H husband's drunk and he's a dopehead and he's a no gooder and and then tell her you got to be subject to that thing no you don't you got to be subject to [Applause] this you better listen to your head do [Applause] it amen you see because the head of the man is Christ and if Christ is in his head don't listen to him same thing with a pastor in the church go don't make any difference amen as a pastor in a church same way if his head is in Christ if he's not subject to the word don't listen to him you leave the man get out don't let your shirt tail hit your back either now so we want to understand whose sons and daughters and then how we stand before God now brother Brandon poses a question in a message called the kinsman redeemer he says who has the most power before God what is an angel an angel is a servant that's right there his servants what are you his son or daughter and who has the most power in heaven then a sinner that has been saved by grace or an archangel that's been standing by his right side the s sinner that has been saved by grace has more Authority in heaven than the Archangel that Stood Beside his by his side without sin because he's a son and a son has more Authority than the servant but we forget what we are we forget many times what we are and we forget how we got here what did God do to make us what we are we're sons and daughters and so Jesus would say all power in Heaven and Earth is given my hand and he says go and I'll go with you now I want to ask you how's he going to go with you he said it this way as the father has sent me so send I you how did the father send him the father that sent him came in him it's not me that do the work my father was dwelleth in me he's doing the work I can't do this humanly I'm doing this as a son that's right cuz my father is living in me yes are you with me now so you see again so he said he says all power in in Heaven and Earth is given to my hand go and I'll go with you whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind it in heaven and what you loose on Earth I'll loose it in heaven and he says oh if the great holy church only realizes power to do these things but there's so much doubt and fear and trembling wonder will it happen could it happen now again those are voices from the crowd now those of you that have been here in my other services you know what I'm talking about the crowd was when they were going to try to cast this devil out of this boy and the disciples couldn't do it and the and Jesus found the crowd questioning them and and so you know the the crowd will always will always question you know and and the crowd can come from well these were Jews and they should have been Believers and if anybody should have been able to beli that God could move mountains that God could heal that God would deliver that he was a God of all power it should have been am but they couldn't oh you can only do things this if you're a prophet or if you're this or you're that or when the Messiah comes or one day in the future one day when the squeeze comes one day when the third pull happens that's the crowd you said well brother Tim what about that I know people are waiting on the third pull I don't know what you're waiting waiting on the third pull was the opening of those Seven Seals the revealing of the Mysteries it is not something coming it is something that is here amen so you see the third pull of course was third phase of brother Brandon's Ministry which would be the opening of the word so I'm saying to you every promise in the book has been and open to you and handed to you as a Believer how else are you going to take a [Applause] Rapture amen so as long as there's so much fear and doubt and trembling could it happen as long as that that exists the church can never stand upright whenever talk of fear is vanished oh God help my tongue and the Holy Spirit is completely in control of the church then all fears are gone and the church has that power why they have everything that heaven owns behind them they are ambassadors of the throne an ambassador of Christ has the authority and anything that Christ owns belongs to that Ambassador and he said go into all the world you are my witnesses that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and what is a witness it is an ambassador is to come and witness something the whole powers of Heaven is right in your hands oh why do we say and the church is Barren and we set dormant because we don't recognize these things so what God's wanting to do is wake you out of spiritual Amnesia it ain't that you're not who you are it's because of Amnesia you forgot who you are you don't realize what God sent you here to do the works that I do shall you do also so Ephesians 1 will tell us that we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we're enthroned with him to rule with Christ with all things under our feet amen and the message of Grace has been to restore a fallen man back to his original position in in so much that we will actually be the people in this last days will be standing on their feet and be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye now in Ephesians 1 Paul says this to the Believers to the ones that are in Christ Jesus and I want to remind you this message is the adoption message it is sent to us by Malachi for to rest store us back to our original position in Christ and brother bradam looked from you know for for example brother Bram looked over in a meeting he was just in and he looked over where the night before there had been a whole row of wheelchairs and and in that in that meeting um there was he he would come the next day and he' look and there was only one or two left in there and we don't know if them were new arrivals or what but he says if he said I'm so thankful that whole row of wheelchairs there there's only two or three left in here if every believer knew their place lady on the cart man on the crutches there there wouldn't be a feeble person in this building in the next 20 minutes that's right if every per man could simply find his place are her place in Christ Jesus what a difference it would make amen now he said I know you I feel your mind rolling fast brother brandom now I I know where I'm at he said you think you do that's it if you did it would be different now we must know the power that is available to us through Redemption when the disciples were confronted by that demon that they couldn't cast out they wanted to know why right and the disciples had the power they had the word the word had given them power Jesus the word made flesh had sent them out as said cast out Devils amen heal the sick that's right amen he he had given them the command and and the word was there he'd given the power but they were lacking the faith to operate the power they had and the question Jesus why couldn't we do it and why couldn't they because they had listened to the crowd and their faith had turned from Faith to unbelief you know if if I can explain something about that just for a minute you know unbelief is actually faith is Faith aimed in the wrong direction you know if you're an atheist and you believe that everything come from a chemical reaction out there and there's no God there's a that unbelief requires a lot of faith it's Faith turned in the wrong direction in fact of the matter atheism is a religion amen it's a worship of man a worship of self and a worship of nothingness out of which nothing came so you know when when we're coming back around to this you remember even Malachi 4 is kind of like a magnet you know you got a two poles within you a magnet has the negative and the positive and one pulls and one pushes and so when when you were a sinner you were born with the pole being negative toward God and pushing him away and you were drawn to the world and sin and to the devil but Redemption comes and even Malachi for comes to turn the heart back to Faith again so he he he listen what he does he turns that faith that you had come on and answered in the right direction where now you believe God and you believe his word and you believe it's true and you reject the devil's lie and you know what happened in your life amen once you were pulled to the world and pulled to sin and you resisted God and God turned your heart and now you're pulled toward God and pulled toward his word pulled toward Bel and you resist the devil and he's got to plee from you oh yeah amen now if you sat down on me for the rest of the service you at least got that but there's more there's more now they had the word the disciples did the word was flesh then and the word told them I give you power and they had the power but they didn't have the faith to operate the power now apparently before they had had it because Jesus had even said I witness Satan fall like like lightning from Heaven I I I wish I witnessed the power at work and that made Satan fall but now they face a demon which is in this epileptic child and they can't cast it out because the crowd is questioning and now it just will and down they go and like I said we got a crowd of unbelief in this world coming from every direction yelling screaming from the crowd you can't they can't believe in prophets they can't believe in prophecies and those that can believe in a prophet and prophecies can't believe that God speaks now they denied all the gifts until the point they don't even believe in the fivefold ministry gifts Satan has effectively did what he could to put God in a box and make him yesterday and not today but you see if you are born again Faith was born into you and faith is a characteristics of a Believer uh the word gives you power and but faith is a channel through which the word does its work so brother bandam would teach us in the message perfect faith that Jesus had Faith with his power and he says I can do nothing in myself now we all realize that humanly when I pray for somebody I I can't help them you know it reminds me of U Jack Co who got some inspiration from Brother brandham we've talked about it before and he got inspiration and started believing in Divine Healing he was a skeptic at first brother Bram called him a convert to Divine Healing and he and Ja Jack Cole had a had a guy that was just hideously crippled and he was just malformed I don't know I I didn't see it but I mean from what his testimony was he was really malformed and it just looked like an impossible situation and Jack Cole looked at this man as he you know hideously dis deformed and coming toward him in the prayer line and he said man I I've seen God do a lot of things I don't know if I got the faith for that that's what he's he's battling you know in his mind when that guy gets up to his turn he said you go back to the end of the line so guy works his way back to the to the front again he sends him back again go go back to the end of the line does it again go back to end of the line finally there wasn't no end of the line he was the end of the line there was all you know everybody had been prayed for but him he stands up there and he said God I don't know what to do I don't know if I have faith for this and the spirit of God spoke to him says Jack I'm the Healer not you we got to remember there's more than just humans amen we are vessels filled with deity the spirit of God is in us and we are commissioned by a word to do a work uh so Jesus had Faith with his power he real realized he relied he said on what he was notice he relied in knowing that he was the word amen and he had faith in God who made him the word he was God the word and the Word was in him and that gave him Faith because he understood his position well brother Tim if if I was if I was born sinless like Jesus shut your mouth you were and your New Birth come on Amen who are you identifying with that old man that was buried in water and baptism and you raised up in newness of Life are you identifying with that don't identify with that identify I am a new creature in Christ Jesus all things have passed away and behold all things are [Applause] new well Jesus said glorify me Lord with the glory that I had with thee before the world began see Jesus knew he was God he knew he was always God he you know he was born knowing he was God and you know I I'm not that way I I'm I was born a human and and I'm not that way let me explain something about Jesus the Bible tells you in his humiliation that he put aside his godship to become human yes sir so Jesus as a man could not re remember what he was because like us it's veiled to us but what he did was believed what the word said about [Applause] him just like you have to do well if I do you know when you're born again I was chosen and him before the foundation of the world I came from God and I'm going back to [Applause] God you know Jesus talks about the Holy Ghost is something you know and that day you will know I'm in the Father the father me and I in you so you see what did it gave him his position this is why you've got to read the word you've got to read what God said about you not what the crowd is saying that's right not what your past says that old man is dead you're born a new now that gave him Faith cuz he understood his position he knew what he was and I want you get he knew what he was because the scripture had said he was this what do you think that I go back into the scripture over and over and over again and and remind you of the prophecies in the word of God that they're not just stories in the Bible but they're prophesying of you Jesus would do the same he said as Jonas was in the belly of the whale three days and night so the son of man be in the heart of the earth what was he doing he looked in the word and he saw his position and he saw that his Jonah was in the belly of the Well in that dark valy belly of death so will I go down into death but I'm going to rise out of [Applause] it amen that's why we ought to be able to look at the word and we can see Enoch the seventh from Adam and here we are the seven age from the second Adam and here we are in the last day of people walking with God hallelujah while the rest of the world is going on and groping in sin and darkness we're walking with God and one day we're going to take our final step into a theophany Hallelujah because we are Enoch and because Enoch prophesied of the coming of the Lord [Applause] and we're here in his coming and he prophesied of us hallelujah amen Jesus knew he was he understood his position because the scripture said it was this he said in three days I'll rise how does he know cuz he says David said I'll not leave his soul in hell that's the grave neither will I let my Holy One see corruption amen come on so he knew corruption comes in 70 72 hours so he says three days I'll rise cuz it's prophesy to me oh David that was set of David David said that that was set of David he realized that David he was prophesying Hallelujah Abraham was Pro prophesying Sarah was prophesying of a Barren 2,000 year old church that's going to bring back the promised son prophesying the scripture has spoken he knew what it was cuz the scripture said he was this and every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scriptures said he would be and he knew what he was therefore he relied upon what God had made him and if he did that then can't we rely upon what God made us as Believers these signs shall follow them that believe he had faith in what he was and if you're a Believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer yes amen reminds me when my wife had her first brain bleeding she was in the hospital my children family gathered together in the the the waiting room there we couldn't go into ICU room where she was out and we gathered there and I could look and see upon the face of my children the concern they had for their mother and when they did you know I looked upon them and I said you know this is not a time to Fe here this is a time to believe this is a time to believe I said we are believers I said like brother John leay and I use him for an example there I said you know brother John he's a Minnesotan so I you know I went through him around house about different things can can we can can can you do this or can you do that can you fix this can you repair that oh yeah yeah that's what we do that's what we do you see he that's what he does and I said and we're Believers in moments like this we believe cuz we're Believers and that's what we do and when I said that out of my mouth came and she will be in the icy room tonight and tomorrow she'll be in her own bed here in this hospital and then the next night she'll be at home and God gave us six more years to spend [Applause] together but that's what happens when we believe God would have took her then oh yeah but you see like Hezekiah he asked God for some more time amen sometimes God will take you he you know your time's up he don't give an extra day so that's why you always have to be ready love where you can love care where you care hold on to what you got if you're a Believer you have faith in what you are you are a Believer and and if you got faith in God then the Bible says this in 1 John 3:21 if our hearts can Dem us then we can't have faith or or you know if our hearts condemn us you know we can't have confidence with God and he said so he said if our heart's condemn us not then we have confidence toward God so you cannot get anything when you got sin in your life that's condemning you it clogs the flow so you go and you get that settled first that's right amen it's okay settle it then come back and believe why did Brother brandom tell them that we're harlots and and whatever else that came into his prayer line and they were Sinners repent and you can receive amen I mean you know well you got to have many many many years of works and whatever and prove yourself good and worthy and it ain't on your worthiness or your goodness is on what God said so if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence toward God that he hears us so as long as we're doing things wrong you can't have confidence with God you actually put yourself back as a sinner that's right that's right you see but when your heart don't condemn you and you know you're a Believer and there's nothing between you and God you can just ask what you will and it and know it'll be done because the word's given to you just like it was to the disciples amen now the only thing you have to do according to the prophet is have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are so we're just going to look at that just for a few minutes here and and and um and and just realize what did the word say let's just go over some of the things from the Bible and and he tells you that therefore If any man is in Christ he is a new creation the old has passed away and behold the new Has Come All Things Have Become new so he says old has passed away the new has come that new creation it means something just made uh which is uncommon or new or unheard of you see we're not cleaned out and covered over we are brand new we're a new species you know the devil had never seen anything like Jesus I mean every one of them even they all had to testify behold this is the Son of God devil had never seen a man like Jesus that's right when he when he stuck his finger into him and he pulled it out went down into hell and conquered death hell in the grave and Rose up he had never seen a human being ever rise above death that's right he had never seen a species like this that no matter which way he tempted him he stayed with the word this was a brand new SP species but on the day of Pentecost that new species gave birth to 120 in the upper room and out of the upper room came 120 Jesus sons of God filled with the spirit of God come on somebody and when they were filled with the spirit of God they would speaking Heaven's language amen Supernatural was taking place amen it gave Satan had never seen anybody here he thought he'd run him away there he was in glory he had went away but now he's back on Earth in 120 filled with the same Spirit of Jesus Amen the same power of Jesus the Same Authority is Jesus Hallelujah and what do you believe about the coming of the Lord in this day and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven amen I believe there's a new species on the earth that's are the same species that Jesus Christ was and there are people the devil don't know what to do with Hallelujah they'll be tempted by everything in the Satan's eating that will overcome I say they will overcome cuz the Bible said they would that him that overcometh will I practice it with me in my Throne he couldn't say that unless somebody would overcome and fact the very word release creates you into being you are the very creation of the word of God that's right the word being made flesh in bright form God taken men and women who were slaves of the devil setting them free and now their hands which once served the devil serve God their mouth that once spoke lies now speak only truth their feet that was quick to shed blood is now obedient to the word flesh you Lord Ephesians 4:24 for we are his workmanship I can't say it enough God didn't make any junk he's not a bad Craftsman when he made you he made you perfect that's amen as far as God concerned it's over with right right right amen he already listen he has already seen you in Perfection it's like brother brandham would declar somebody healed cuz he saw in the future like you know like Bill da he said Bill da he said You know here he's dying 90 year old he's under oxygen tent for I don't know how many days and he's dying and and they've given him up and he gets there and as he's talking to him praying a vision breaks he said build out I will shake your hand again in the front of the blue Bo Restaurant you're healed I don't know it might have been one day two days three days four days 5 days before he come out from under that oxygen tent but it was already done and God has already seen a people in a Rapture he said I'll have a bride and she will be without spot or without Reco or without a blemish and he can't go back on his word I don't care how many false docum have I don't care how much evil there is I don't care how much wickedness in the world God would have a bride without SP without a wrinkle without a bleming a woman of faith let's just go Ephesians 4:24 it says we're created after the likeness of God and true righteousness and Holiness so we're created after the likeness of God remember we were first to come by creation that's why that's the way sons of God are born they would become straight from the hand of God by the spoken word amen but because of the Fall we come through sex and because we come into the sexual birth we're born in in Incorruptible bodies so well brother Tim you got all this power why don't you just call it all to an end can't till the last name comes on the book what if it happened somebody called to an end 500 years ago you wouldn't be here here your granddaddy great granddaddy nobody God has a purpose he has a plan and since all of us have to come this way he's got to wait until every name that's on the book I know man gets impatient wants to close the book and wants to wants to say Mercy's over I don't know who when God died and left you in charge but Mercy isn't over Mercy will not be over until the last pred destinated seed whose names are in the book are manifested on the Earth right so here we are and we are his we are created after the likeness of God and true righteousness and Holiness in Ephesians 2:10 we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works amen which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them amen so God prepared it and we're going to walk in it now look maybe you're not all there but just keep walking amen you're going to walk in true righteousness and pure Holiness you're going to do the good works you have been created in Christ Jesus as the Bible said in 1 Peter 2 and9 you are a chosen Offspring that's a chosen race a royal priesthood you got a right to go before the throne of grace you are a priest nobody's got to intercede between you and Goden you are a holy nation you are people for his own possession that's what it means peculiar you are people for his own possession I created you for my purpose yes the devil had you but I took you I redeemed you I washed you I cleansed you I remade you I mean you're really not something made over you you are a new creature and in all of this you are my possession I did this for my own possession cuz you're bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh and life of my life and spirit of my spirit and all that I am you are in fact Ephesians 1:4 said even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world now you think you've done something that you can keep God from loving you before you ever did it he chose [Applause] you somebody ought to shout before you ever S one sin he knew what you would do he knew the kind of life but he chose you in him before the foundation of the world Hallelujah he did not choose you because you were holy you were not holy but he chose you to be holy what you couldn't do on your own he chose you to become that you are not blameless you are full of blame but he chose you to be without blame and the key word is before him the devil will never believe this oh yeah but who cares if God says I'm holy I'm holy if God says I'm righteous I'm righteous if God says I'm his child I don't care what the devil says I'm God's child it doesn't matter what the devil has said every time he opens his mouth and his lips moves he's lying and I'm not believing his lies anymore I have been chosen to be holy and with I blame before him well the preacher said this or that one or this one judges I don't care what they say I've been chosen to be holy and Without Blame before him because of his [Applause] love I can run this building speaking in tongues wouldn't do you any good make me feel good though cuz he who speaks in tongues edifies himself I want you to get this 2 Corinthians 521 tells us you were God's righteousness for our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of God don't you realize what the blood has done for you yes thank you and because of that it shows we're a friend of God that's right you know the Bible said he that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet's reward and brother Brandon was asked the question what is a prophet's reward he said to be a friend of the Prophet right that's right amen you know you receive me as a servant of God as a pastor you know you know then then then you you know you receive that reward you're my friend there's a relationship you can come to me about anything any situation whatever because there's a relationship and when you're a friend of God hallelujah amen it's a relationship and you know the the the thing about it is some of my very closest friends my buddies are my children that's right my children are my closest friends I got good friends and y'all know I have besties y'all know that but my children are my closest friends we're buddies and Jesus said that about you look at what he said in John 15:15 no longer do I call you servants for the servant don't know what his master is doing but I have called you friends for all that I've heard from my father I have made known to you and how much more should people in this message in this last day be able to say that because to who has been made known the mysteries of God come on [Applause] somebody Jesus thought so much of his disciples he said I tell you what they ask him Lord will you come at this time and restore restore the kingdom to Israel he said the times and the seasons is not known to to you now this is but here's what I want you to get you just focus on this one one thing you'll receive power after the Holy Ghost has come on you this is where the kingdom comes but the kingdom to Israel I you know that time and season I can't tell you that right now that's not for you to know and then they asked him you know and then he even said now remember here he is and he comes as a human and he says I don't know when I'm coming back that's only held in the hands of the Father which is the eternal spirit but but me as a human I don't know I don't I I I can't tell you that but after his death burial and resurrection and he went back to being God again he comes to the aisle of patmas and he Reveals His coming come on now some of it he will Veil he will Veil it with seven churches and talk about seven churches and a message to each one of them and seven stars in my hand all these are mysterious things C until his friends come yes sir until it's bride time that's right until it's evening time until it's time and in that time it'll be made known for in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystry of God will be finished and I'm going to reveal to my friends that's right somebody ought to shout hallelujah that ought to tell you you're a friend of God this morning to you Amen to the world is not given but to you it has been know made known the mysteries of the kingdom of God hallelujah you've been made privy because why you're his lover his sweetheart and he's pulling her you up to him and has whispered to you the L secrets what I've been doing it come down through Seven Ages there were others in the book who was not there at Pentecost I had to I had to sit on the throne and intercede and I've been interceding for Seven Ages until the last one but now we're in the last age and I'm releasing The Secret of My coming and I'm pouring out my spirit and there's a mighty Angel and empowerment that's coming to empower bride in this last [Applause] day no longer do I call you servants for the servant does not know what his master is doing but I have called you friends for all that I've heard of my father I've made known to you and when he went back to being God again leaving manhood man manship going back into godship he comes to to John on the aisle of patmas and he reveals the coming what will happen in the end time that's why the Book of Revelation is a special book in this last day because it's the unveiling the Apocalypto the making known the manifestation of all the end time events and so we are because we're friends we are we are join hirs therefore we have a part in this now Jesus stood there with Mary and Martha and he he said take away the stone why he was God he could have spoken into Oblivion say St be no more that's right the power was there but they had to do something it was a part they had to play you know he would look upon the Harvest and he' say and and he's the lord of the Harvest and he says to the disciples pray the Lord of the Harvest that he'll send labors into his harvest in other words you ask me to do what I'm going to do I'm going to do this but you got to ask me to you know why because it's going to be through your prayers through your intercession through your working that that that will actually be The Works will be done through you so you ask me you intercede you call Heaven down you've got something to do amen and brother Brandon says we're buddies talk about us and God we're buddies it's a church we got something to do ourselves he said here's the gospel I know it but if you just sit there and Don't Preach it what good is it going to do you got to do something you got to make an effort you say well I believe God can heal but I just don't know stand up and let that word become your word believe it don't reason it just believe it amen so you see again uh when we pray we got to understand you know that we have to leave the realm of human thinking and in into the spirit because Jesus said if you ask the father anything in my name I will do it and brother brandom said you realize what that means do you realize if we go before God In The Name of Jesus it's just the same as Jesus himself praying that's right isn't me praying anymore if I come in his name and he recognizes his name and Jesus said whatever you ask the father in my name that I do then I go to the father in jesus' name it isn't me praying anymore it's Jesus it's his Spirit praying through me and then I got to receive what I asked for because he said it and it's God's Own word it can't do nothing else but produce it hallelujah amen so you know and I'm going to get into it but we're already out of time yep you don't realize we've been here for an hour and a half that I've been with everything that's but I want you just to stop a minute for a moment let's just focus just for a minute because we're going to discover as a minister on this cuz I know the question comes in just like it did with laus if he could Open the Eyes of the blind if he could make the lames to walk couldn't he have caused Lazarus not to die that was their question that was the crowd they looked and said if if if he could do that if that was really real then why did he let Lazarus die and that's the question comes back around to us today after we've even received loss and we say well if we could ask anything in his name and he'll do it why is there still death and dying and this is what we're going to understand about the laws of God and really realizing that you can't go beyond his laws and the law of God says the day you eat thereof that day you die so there's still going to be dying and death until the end is called when is that going to be when the last name on the book is manifested on the earth and until then we're going to have people get sick and some will go by the way of the Grave well if you can do anything listen again we work according to the law of God and the law of God is the will of God and as I've explained God has a set time for every one of us he and and we realize we can't live here forever he's ordained it so he's got a graduation for every one of us that's right amen he's going to take us out of this body of Flesh and he's going to move us into the Heavenly realm or one day he's going to bring the Heavenly realm here and take us out of here and we'll meet him in the air come on but we work according to the law and the will of God right why didn't Jesus when he said La has come forth just scream out come forth and all the dead raised it couldn't happen till his death burial and Resurrection he had to pay for the sins of the Old Testament Saints to be able to raise them all and bring them from Paradise and into new bodies and so the law of God's Own word kept him from doing so but the laws of God's Own word even would keep things from happening to Jesus for example that day the crucifixion we're going to hurry this up boys the Passover it's going to be and these old boys are still on the cross and the thieves are groaning this one in the middle Jesus he slumped over looks like he's dead but I'll tell you what to hurry this death along you know because what they would do is in the crucifixion it was such a gruesome death where where the lungs would be where you know where you would have to pull yourself up with your arms to breathe and and get a breath and then your strength would go and you now you can't breathe you're all collapsed down get a breath so they struggle back up now their arms are tired they struggled back up Jesus has already given up to ghost Passover times coming got to get these boys off the cross so they go up and break the legs literally go up with blow after blow until the bones are broken in the legs and these boys can no longer push themselves up and get a breath they beat one they all go over they bypass Jesus and they walk up to him and they beat this one they come back and their arms are pulled back and they're ready to do it but there's a word and the word says not one of his bones will be broken but the word said they pierced him with the sphar in his side and all of a sudden a Roman soldier don't even know what's going on but from an unseen realm something happens and his his Club is thrown down and a spear goes up into his side because the law of God's word had forbidden a bone to be broken every one of us will go down into death but there is a people on the Earth right now who there is a word spoken over them and they are called the alive and remain and no matter how much death worketh in our members which it does Amen I'm getting older I'm looking older I to say this God forgive me and help me with my kids but they're looking older too they no longer look like teenagers anymore they they're all pushing they're not 40 they're pushing there they're looking older Lydia was back in the office today and she said yeah I'm 44 and I said 44 I remember that it was 1998 and brother Daniel Williams sitting in the wheelchair brain brain tumor they operated and Harry was in a dying condition looked at me he said how old are you today brother Tim it' be a month later or two two or 6 weeks later he'd be gone how old are you now brother Tim I said I'm 44 he says a 44 magnum I said yeah I used to be a lowly 22 but somehow things are changed I said now I'm a 44 and you're calling me a magnum you know there's a word that is laying over your life yes and Satan cannot go beyond that word and any Temptation that comes to you there's a word says you're going to overcome it come on Amen there is somebody in this day going to sit on the throne because I read in my Bible to the L to see an age that him that overcometh will I gr to sit on my Throne Hallelujah there's a people in this life they ordained for a purpose and you are that people I tell you if I were you today I would claim it for myself I would claim it for my children I would claim it for my grandchildren I don't care how way were how far away they are I would claim it I say yes God this is what your word said of me I am an overcomer my children are Overcomers my grandchildren Overcomers we will be conquerors through him that loved us
