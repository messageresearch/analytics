[0:13] When all foundations have been shen
[0:19] when I'm left standing in the dark
[0:25] and all I feel is my heart breaking.
[0:31] You still rain and you're still gone.
[0:37] When it feels all hope is faded,
[0:42] the heavy questions hit so hard.
[0:49] And though my soul may feel forsaken,
[0:55] you still reign and you're still gone.
[1:01] I can't see what's before me.
[1:06] I know that I can trust your heart.
[1:12] In this one truth will be my story.
[1:18] You still reign in God.
[1:24] I will declare that you are with me.
[1:30] No voices whisper that you're not.
[1:36] You'll never leave me or take me.
[1:42] You're still
[1:44] gone.
[1:48] I can't see what
[1:51] me.
[1:53] I know that I can trust your heart.
[1:59] And this one truth will be my story.
[2:04] Oh, will rain your stor.
[2:11] You are good and you are faithful
[2:17] as you have been.
[2:23] working all things for your glory.
[2:28] Cuz you still reign and you're still
[2:34] and when my enemies surround me,
[2:40] I'll trust the victory of your cross
[2:46] and fix my eyes upon you, Jesus.
[2:50] [Applause]
[2:52] You are God and I am not.
[2:58] You are good and you are faithful.
[3:04] As you have been
[3:10] working all things for glory
[3:16] cuz you still reign in your heart.
[3:22] I can't do all
[3:25] me.
[3:27] I know that I can trust your heart.
[3:34] Won't truth be my story.
[3:37] [Music]
[3:39] Then you still reign and you're still
[3:42] God.
[3:46] This one truth will be my story.
[3:50] Oh, you still rain and you're still
[3:54] gone.
[3:56] [Music]
