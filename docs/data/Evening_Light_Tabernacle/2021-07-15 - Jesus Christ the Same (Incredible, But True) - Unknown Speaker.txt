mercy lord where would we be if it wasn't for your grace lord your mercy that you've called us in this generation lord we see a world lord just tumbling into chaos going deeper into darkness lord but yet in our hearts and our lives we saw a great light the light of god lord this called us out of darkness brought us to a place a firm place to stand upon lord it doesn't matter what's going on around us doesn't matter what's happening lord in our boat today we know lord that you're here with us and even in his father lord you're more than able for any situation for any need that we have lord you've seen the hands that were lifted all over this building you know what that hand represents lord and i believe it's an action to cause a reaction just as that woman would lift a hand and touch the hem of your garment i believe we're that close to you tonight lord to touch your garment father to reach out and grab ahold of what we have need of lord and you have the answer for every situation lord we just commit this time in your hands lord everything to be said and done for your glory and for your honor father thank you for making us your people in jesus name amen amen you turn your bibles to hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8 also matthew 21 and verse 21 amen brother tim is almost here from visiting sister karen today hey man she's just really just still continues to heal and we're just believing for a complete healing and complete deliverance and total restoration amen and she responded to a few things today not really open her eyes much but we know she has before and she'll do it again amen so we're just resting upon that hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever matthew 21 21 says and jesus answered and said unto them verily i say unto you if you have faith and doubt not yet shall not own ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if you shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done i i don't see that it says it might be or may be it shall be done and all things how many can say all things whatsoever you asked you shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive amen we'll let you be seated today i'd like to speak to you on jesus christ the same incredible but true incredible but true looking at this scripture in matthew 21 it's a a scripture of no doubt that we draw strength from in our times of need and situations and and i believe that god was speaking to a people that would be standing upon the even though he's speaking to a people there before him but it was also speaking to a people that would come in the last day that would have need of these things that we could draw strength from these things and it says you shall say unto this mountain it's a this is actually in the greek it's a they call it a proverbial phrase used by arabic writing is to remove mountains is to accomplish the most difficult the stupendous which is the extremely impressive and incredible thing amen i don't think he would put that in his word unless it was the ability for that word to come to pass i i don't think that he would come to the place that we're living in and and you know when all of a sudden this word is no longer has power it no longer has strength it has no longer the ability to move in the time that we're living in but it does have the same ability the same power because his word is ever true amen his word is not a temporary word it's not a word that's but he spoke in that moment and that's all it was to it but it's an eternal word therefore we can pull strength from it even in the day that we live in you know brother branham would say this and god talked to moses he said i believe that the age has come now the miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of the spirit the power and signs and wonders this great pouring out of god's spirit in the last days and that's the thing that'll bring faith in the people that will take a rapture in faith that'll take the church into glory i believe it and i'm here to stand on this same place i believe it as well i believe this is the time for the phenomenal this is the time for the baptism of the spirit of the holy ghost it's the time for god to show his power and we got many quotes that we could i was actually playing the tape to my mom yesterday as brother branham would say god loves to display his power and so he'd bring you to a place so he would have to show you who he is and he says all of these sayings coming in this last days and this moment that we're living in now as we've been on this thought of jesus christ the same you know the devil doesn't doesn't he don't he don't mind if you think of god in a time past or a god of history or or you think of a god maybe in the future and we keep putting it off in the future but what he really don't want you to believe is the god of now amen a word of now a time of now that this is the time for these things to come to pass amen you know i brother brother i seem brother window was ministering on this this title if not now when you know as we've seen it repeated several times in the last few months on the chosen you know and i thought that was a very good thing as no doubt jesus would wrestle within himself you know when is my time to step into the place that god has called me to be because he knew when he stepped into that place where it would lead to and so he would battle with that but you know i believe that we're also come to a place to where if not now when are we going to believe for the supernatural if not now when are we going to believe for the baptism of the holy ghost to fall upon our lives to to changes to lift us up to to rewrite our whole lives amen if not now when are we going to believe for the power of god and the church of god if not now when are we going to believe for the signs and wonders to be in our midst that god's the healer and the deliverer and the savior amen if not now when are you going to believe for your family to be amen to be saved if not now when are you going to believe for the healing of your body if not now when are you going to believe that god can come and do exactly what he did 2 000 years ago what he did 60 years ago he's still the same today i believe the time is now that people begin to believe with all their hearts that this is the moment this is the time look we see the world getting in this position we see the world going into complete chaos say man thinking about the believers in south africa right now as their countries being torn apart and turned upside down to where they can't even get a loaf of bread and they can't go to the market they can't go to work because of some rioting that has taken place and and destruction everywhere listen it's just a foretaste of what is coming upon this earth this earth is going deeper and deeper and deeper into darkness it's going deeper and deeper into chaos it's going deeper and deeper and deeper into sin so if we can see the world of coming into fruition of what the word spoke of it and the word is also spoken of a people that's coming into their place into their position to believe that all things are possible i don't know yeah and then we're coming to moments and we're going to have to believe for some incredible things amen and even more incredible than a healing or a deliverance amen what's more incredible than the rapture for a change of the body amen you know what brother branham would talk about in the paradox he said and you know webster would describe the word paradox as something that seems incredible but true therefore a paradox would be the same as a miracle amen a paradox is something that seemed just like it couldn't be the knowledge of human mind it's all together incredible but yet it's proven true how has it proven how's god's word proven true by it coming to pass it's not proven true by science is not proven true by intellectual abilities to put it all together god's word is proven true by coming to pass the word that says he the lord god that heals all our diseases is proven true by coming to pass in a body that is sick but now is now made well amen the word that is spoken of it he will he will forgive all iniquities is proven true by the blood of jesus the holy ghost coming into a life and so changing their life amen to where it's so incredible who they used to be they're not no more what they used to do they don't do that no more that's an incredible thing in a world that is so driven by sin and and the attributes and the things of sin until people are actually drunk on on sin they're so consumed with it they're so bound by it but in the middle of a sin consumed world a person can be born again of the holy ghost and their desires be so changed and so turned around to where they're no longer the same person they no longer have the same desires they no longer have the same wants the same amen whether we used to go where they used to go they don't go no more what they used to do they don't do no more amen if god can do that in an age that we're living in it's an incredible thing but it's a true thing i'm looking at the manifestation of the holy ghost and lives amen in the middle of chaos in the middle of laodicea when this world is at its worst and sin is at its apex apex right in the middle of it god has raised up a people to show him my power is greater than satan's power my power is greater than the fear my power is greater than unbelief my power is greater than drugs and alcohol and every spirit of the devil my power is greater than sex since my power is greater than the enemy [Applause] and he's allowed him to come into this world so great to show he's greater oh hallelujah amen it's a miracle a miracle it's all together incredible but yet it's proven to be true it's incredible but yet it's the truth people today a lot of them he said a lot of modernist believes that the days of miracles are past or some of them believe they're coming he said they don't believe there's no such a thing many times as a miracle he said i believe that the world is full of miracles believe that this church this evening is full of miracles it goes he goes on he said i believe it's a paradox constantly that in a sin-filled world there's a miracle oh hallelujah in a world full of sickness there's a miracle in the world full of sin there's a miracle he said for instance i believe that ever born to excuse me every born-again member of the body of christ is a miracle or a paradox in themselves i believe that each one of you methodists and presbyterian and lutheran that never had experienced the baptism of the holy spirit but she was in some formal church that did not believe in the genuine new birth but now have you ever received the baptism of the holy ghost he said it's a perfect example of a paradox he said because something happened to you that changed your whole being and anyone can look at that and know that that is a miracle oh hallelujah amen you can look at your neighbor and say you're a miracle to be honest we're all miracles to be sitting where we're sitting under the deluge of sin and the deluge of unbelief and how dark and how how impossible it may seem but yet we still remain yet we're still here even though all the mind battles and all those pressures of satan's eating yet we're still here yet we still remain amen it's incredible but it's true unless you experience that miracle of receiving the baptism of the holy ghost which changes everything about you unless that happens you cannot be a christian there must be that paradox for you to become a christian because no one can change a spirit in a man and give him the new birth unless it's god outside of god god alone is the only one that can do it and it's a miracle how that god can take a man's thinking and take his ways take his life take everything that he ever thought was true and change it from what it was to what it can be and what he can make it oh my i might have to read that again it's a miracle how that god can take a man's thinking and his ways and his life and everything and change it from what it was to what it can be what he can make it oh think about it the devil thought he had you the devil was trying to destroy you but god rich in mercy came on the scene and he called you from the place that you was and he changed your ways he changed your thinking he changed your life he changed everything about you to what you can be in his thinking to what you can be what he thought about you before the foundation of the world it's incredible but it's true that moon standing now today they say 238 900 feet i don't know how they got that long of a tape measure but they said it was that many miles away from the earth and yet controls the tide on the seas it's incredible you know you go down the beach and sometimes where you're standing looks like it's lower than where the sea is and you're wondering why the ocean ain't coming ain't coming in on you because it seems like it seems incredible that it's not just washing over you because you look like anybody ever been there where it looks like the ocean is higher than where you're standing and it seems like at any moment it should come in and wash you but there's a power there controlling it it's incredible but it's true amen there's a power the moon as it would move around the earth and how it rotates or whatever goes on with that and the gravity pull it pulls the tides in and it pulls them out and it was put in a perfect place it was put in a perfect exact marker from the earth to do its job you know if it would move out of that place chaos would ensue upon this earth even floods and every tsunamis and every kind of thing would take place but yet it stands there amen controlling the tide and the moon rocks you know if it would rock out like that from the earth the tide goes with it it comes back and the tide comes back in god has put the moon over the tides to set the boundaries that they cannot pass this boundary where god drawed the line god drawed the line but the moon holds it in place amen we heard not too many years ago brother donnie reagan talking about the ministry of the moon and how he typed it out with the bride of jesus christ god has drawn the boundaries but he's got a people here holding it in his place that all of these things cannot be unleashed upon this earth until this people gets off the face of this earth [Applause] you can all when god drove the line and said you can only come this close you cannot take the rest of it for i put my guard over you oh hallelujah that moon thousands of miles from the earth calls to that sea and it sets its boundaries and it controls it incredible what is on that moon we're just a few miles off the earth all gravitation all air it goes and it go out into space and there's not even air for millions and millions and millions multiplied on millions of miles and yet it controls what's going on on the earth saying you can only go so far you can go no further for i am the guard of god i am the watchdog that's been set here and you cannot pass these boundaries that's a paradox it cannot be explained it's incredible but it's true amen you know and then we've got a winter time that comes and this year was one of our worst that i could i can ever remember snow on the ground and cold and grounds freezing but there's this little seed that's laying down the inside and it freezes and it bursts open and and the pulp runs out of it and that little germ of life is laying there in the dust and a frozen sheet of ice that would kill any life how is it preserved because alone comes springtime here it comes up again it's incredible but it's true you know we look at hebrews 11th chapter and we understand paul said the world was framed and put together by the word of god a word that could speak and out of that word with material materializing earth and out of that word would word when we materialize the sun out of that word would materialize moons and stars that's incredible that he could say let there be and he was so he would speak out of nothing to form something so that things that do appear today were made out of things that did not appear you're sitting on something today that once did not appear you looked at the sun today that once did not appear tonight you'll go out and you'll see stars that once did not hang there amen you know once there was nothing it was blackness it was it was just nothing but void and empty space but a word spoke and the holy spirit began to woo over that word and bring that word to pass amen until we're amen now we can look and we've got solar systems that they can't even get to the end of and we got stars that they can't even measure the distance of them and we've got things around us and we take so for granted and the word of god spoken to existence so i ask you this question why would we be afraid to trust the one who gives such a word with power and authority why would we be afraid this is the prophet of god why would we be afraid to take that word to ourselves and apply it to ourselves it shows he said if we're afraid that we fall into unbelief but it's a paradox you know it's a it's an incredible thing that that god would call abraham in his old age and he would tell him you're going to i'm going from you i'm going to bring forth a nation and i'm not you're 100 years old and sarah's 90th and you're buying past all the child bearing but out of you is going to come a seed it was incredible it looked impossible but it was true because it came to pass abraham was good as dead sarah passed barry her womb was a good or dead yet god said he was going to bring a child as ask the doctor if a woman 100 or 90 years old can raise a baby or have a baby it's impossible it's incredible but she did it why because god said she would it's an incredible thing to think that a man could sit there with his back to a tent a stranger with dust on his clothes and tell a woman who was behind him what she was thinking about it's incredible but it's true it's incredible you can listen to the text that god would come in our generation and time after time after time say you've done you have this song on you and you got this and you got that and you live at this address and you're in this certain city oh she's to miss it stella incredible but true it was incredible when abraham took isaac to the top of the mountain after he received him and god said take him and sacrifice him unto me when he got to the top of the mountain and he laid isaac on the wood and was ready to take his life and when he was coming down with his hands something caught his hand and there was a voice that spoke and said don't do it abraham there's something that's already been provided and he looks around and there's a ram hung in some bushes he wasn't there when he walked up he wasn't there while he was preparing the altar it wasn't there when he isaac laid down it wasn't there as he pulled back his knife but all of a sudden out of nothing came around it's incredible but it's true how did it get there on top of the mountain there should have been something killed it should have been wild dogs maybe grab it or no water up there why was it there when he picked up the rocks why wasn't it there when when isaac was looking around and saying well we got the wood we got the we got the rocks we got it all where's the sacrifice and abraham would would speak some incredible words my god will provide that hallelujah and out of them words came a creative force that put a ram and a bush well come on now he's called that place jehovah jireh the lord will provide himself a sacrifice true but he is still jehovah jireh he's still the provider he's still the need supplier he's still what you have need of he's just looking for somebody to speak the word and watch him bring it to pass [Applause] it was a paradox when jesus would say if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said it's incredible but it's true we saw it demonstrated in this very age that we're living in brother brown would be in the woods setting by the side of a tree no squirrels in the woods but when a voice spoke and said say where they'll be and he would point his finger to a bare limb walnut tree it said he'll sit right there and there he was it's incredible but true he said where will the next one be over and that bunch of couple stuff and i never took my finger down to there he was where will the next one be out on that snag over the field and there he was it's incredible but it's true and there he went to hattie wright's house and there she's sitting there two boys had been a bunch of renegades boys of the world and there she's sitting there and he said howdy the lord god you said the lord god he provided those squirrels he's jehovah jaira and she responded that's nothing but the truth of god oh hallelujah you don't have to have a big scientific formula to try to come up with what to say just respond to his word and say it's the truth he said it i believe it he said it i'm going to stand upon it his word declares it and i'm not backing up from it [Applause] it's nothing but the truth she said the right thing seems incredible that a human could speak a word and god bring it to pass brother branham would say you know it says as dirty and filthy as we are who are we who is he that sits back yonder beyond the moon stars in space and time and eternity even the angels are dirty in his sight who are we he said but a woman said the right thing and that called on the heart of jehovah said ask her what she wants and it'll be given to her incredible but true right here now in our sight he says there's visible evidence she asked for her boy souls to be christians and god gave her her desires he said oh that's incredible that's more of a miracle than healing a sick person he said that changing a man's life so body and all he is it changed their whole makeup well that tells me if i'm looking at a bunch of people that's been their whole makeup's been changed i'm looking at people who once were druggies and once were alcohols and well into alcohol once were smokers and once was all kinds of every kind of spirits hanging over their lives but god rich in mercy came down upon their lives and the prophet of god said that's more of a miracle than a healing when i say if god could change a life god can heal a sick person if god can lift up brother hell from the darkness of sin and every kind of spirit of hell and change his motives and change his mind and change his heart the same god that did that for him it's the same god that can go to room 106. oh hallelujah because he's the same god and if he can do that great thing he can do that great thing if he can open your eyes he'll open her eyes it's incredible but it's true [Applause] hallelujah if he can restore the thinking of a man amen going down the wrong path got it all made up and all planned out and god changed it in a moment and a person laying there with brain blades this is no hard thing for my god not what i'm seeing around me you know i i was talking and trouble he was me and andrew was talking the other day we went to go pick up something in town as the brothers needed something here for the the little play area was talking about it i said you know i said i don't understand somebody that can't believe in god i said because if you don't believe in god you can't call on him when you have a need and then if you don't get the answer you want it you can't be mad at him because you don't believe in him so i don't understand where somebody like that where they rest where where is the rest for a person like that i know where my rest is my rest isn't the incredible but true hallelujah amen you know it ain't a scientific thing i ain't got to get it all figured out figured out how god's going to do it i just know he's going to do it i ain't got to add it all up it ain't my intellectual ability or some doctor's intellectual ability that's going to produce the healing that my mom needs want to produce the healing that she needs is this word and this word's the same word that saved you and you and you and you and me and everyone here that's saved and filled with the holy ghost that same word that done that is the same word that'll heal every sick person in this church amen it's time that we start believing more than we ever have believed it's time we start standing upon the promises more than we've ever stood upon the promises you think the devil's giving up no he's pushing harder amen but what do you hear in service after service is cannon shots going back nuts i'm not giving up i'm not backing off the promise what good is it going to do me to start disbelieving what good is it going to do me to take a step back and say god ain't saying god what good is it going to know i'm going to go forward i'm going to speak the word of god by his stripes she's healed [Applause] it's incredible but it's true it's a paradox incredible and noah's time that he would come in a scientific net age with an unscientific message couldn't be proven prepare for rain to come from heaven when there was no rain never had been no rain there was no way to get rain up there it had never rained there was no seas there was no waters but yet god told him to make an ocean for saving of his house making heart for saving of his house and god brought the rain down unscientific in a scientific age and you know jesus said as it was in the days of noah so shall it be so therefore there would have to be another message come that's unscientific to a scientific age amen we're not to build a boat christ is building a body amen a place a word a refuge that we can walk into amen it was a paradox when the hebrew children that had decided it was going to stay with god's word regardless of what happened that's where you got to be regardless of what happened and the king built the furnace seven times hotter than it ever been heated and threw those man in there and the intense heat of the fires furnace killed the men that walked up the gameplay with them they died and yet those men walked in the furnace for maybe perhaps three hours there should have been no more than dust left of them the human life that was in them should have perished it made other humans die just getting close to the fire they throw them in there you know maybe say three hours maybe five after a while the king went back had lunch he'd come back and said open up that door there won't even be dust left to them anymore but when he opened them there they were in the middle of the fire unharmed walking around incredible but true how did you how many did you put in there we put three well i'm counting four hallelujah and that one looks like the son of the gods he wasn't the son of the gods he was the son of god they were heathens but god in his great word came down to where they were it's incredible but it's true you know i let's tell a few things for a moment one of my first times to ever go overseas to minute where the first time the minister was with brother danny steeman and brother jackie benton 2003 been ministering a couple of years very young in the ministry and brother danny had met him up there when he moved for a brief moment up to missouri and we became bosom friends and still are today and uh so he invited me to go with him and brother jackie had kind of took brother danny under his wing when brother danny was a young man and took him different places and brother daddy took me down there with brother jackie and and uh just say this brother jackie was a great man of god he's a great man of god he traveled the world over and they wrote songs about his exploits and uh just done some amazing things matter of fact that trip he would get off the plane from the philippines next day get on the plane to go with us to guyana that's what kind of man he was he was the kind of man that when he was down in the middle of a jungle unbelieving kids would walk out of this jungle and say hey brother jackie's back quite a reputation i know people want to criticize him but that's quite a reputation amen and and so here we went down into the jungles for just a little brief excursion and and on a boat down into the river and we're you know we're preaching down at this little place and you know when i you you just try my actually at that time my papaw just went in to have some heart his heart checked and there was a lot of ifs about that and didn't know if he was going to make it or not and here i'm down in the jungles no communication and you know he's worried he starts setting in and things and uh so we're walking back and forth to the church and uh i i i was i can't remember who ministered that night seemed like brother danny did but anyway we're walking back into some moonlit night and i was in the lead and i was walking down this path we'd been walking it for several nights now and so we kind of knew the way and so i'm walking it and i literally as i'm walking i felt a hand a pressure hit me right here in the chest and it stopped me brother danny kind of bumped up behind me and he said what's wrong i said i don't know i said but something stopped me and we started digging in our pockets for our flashlights and shined and there was their most poisonous snake laying right there in our path but god was showing me very early that he's with me it's incredible but it's true we'd go later on that journey and we'd fly 45 minutes off into a basically a wilderness out into the jungle way off and they're laying landing a little dirt strip and we'd get in a boat and we'd go up the river for a few hours and we'd preach there would move over here for another few hours to another church and preach there and and and the brother taking us wanted to go way on up about eight hours into the jungle areas further and and and to go to this nomad tribe that he had been witnessing to and and so he said i don't know if they'd be there he said i can't get communication i've been trying he said but what do y'all feel to do and so we felt to go so we got in the boat about two o'clock in the morning because it was a river to catch the tides you had to go with the tide coming in it went out went in and out with the tide so we jumped in the boat and we going with the tied up river about 10 o'clock in the day the days breaking had been broken and we pulled under this canopy of the jungle and you know i'm trying to figure out what's going on and i sit up for a moment and i look around and out of the bushes just almost like they just come out of nowhere it's coming this white-haired indian and these two other indians with them and they got these sticks in their hands and this white-haired indian screaming to the just screaming like this and i'm thinking lord have mercy yeah you delivered me from a snake and i'm about to be lunch i didn't know what was happening and so i i'm just sitting there kind of looking trying to figure it out and look at brother basil there taking this up and i see a tear coming down his eye and i said oh we got something's happening here and so i i he finally turned around and looked at me and brother danny and brother jackie and he says this is the chief of that tribe that i wanted to visit he said he was in his tent or tp whatever they have little mud hut and he said he was there and he went to him he prayed and went to sleep and he said an angel woke him up and said go to the mouth of the creek i got three white men bringing fire [Applause] it's incredible but it's true hallelujah hey that's a moment that you feel like i catch amen god knows exactly what we're going through he would show us this a few weeks ago brother ron spencer's as we're ministering and i'm asking god and asking god to move and to speak and dad's asking for him to speak and people and because my mom was having these situations and all of a sudden out of nowhere my ipad would begin to play about a song down from his glory showing us he's riding the fire with us it's incredible but it's true [Applause] it's so true to me i'd go to my mother's bedside there in the icu and she hadn't spoken in 18 hours and i'd begin to speak to her and i said mom i know god has come down in this fire and out of her mouth she'd begin to sing down from his glory every living story my god and savior care and jesus but it's true hey man she has been seen in the kitchen shouting she's been seen in this church shouting people having dreams god is speaking god is moving it's time we believe all things are possible read something today that gave me encouragement brother brown would preach the gates of hell shall not present prevail and you would think of that sometimes many times as satan being on the attack and he is on the attack but this writer was right and he said you know it's time that the people of god go on the offensive it's time we quit sitting back and letting the devil come on our property and moving back a little further and going back a little further and going back a little further he said it's time that we'd go on the offensive he said i want to encourage your hearts because the scripture says the gates of hell will not prevail he said a gate is not an offensive it's a defense so hell is trying to defend itself come on somebody amen it's time you realize your enemy it's not it's not you know it's not us being afraid of him it's him being afraid of what's on the inside of you it's time we grab our swords and we start taking the word of god and we say no you're not having this child and you're not having this body it don't belong to you [Applause] hallelujah it's time something rises up on somebody's heart and saying devil i've had enough of you i'm not taking it one more night i'm not taking it one more moment but today your head's coming off the gates of hell will not prevail in other words the gates of hell are not going to be able to stand before the army of the living god [Applause] hallelujah it would be a paradox incredible but true that a little boy could defeat a goliath a giant when the rest of the army was sitting back in fear and brother wayne said something that really struck me the other day he said when saul tried to give david his armor david looked at saul and said well you're scared to fight with it what good is it going to do me and that's the truth people want to hand you their favorite quotes and they want to hand you their favorite things and they you know their favorite ideas but they're scared to fight but i'll take what's proven and what's proven is the lord said in mark 16 they shall lay hands upon the sick they shall recover it's proven that by his stripes they shall be healed it's proven amen the promises unto you and your children proven amen it's incredible but it's true you know it'd be an incredible thing which is what the lord spoke maybe used a different word but basically basically basically the same thought that brother wayne lawson was right over here on this side of the building pushing around some dirt there to build so we built the parking lots and things had to build up that side over there about two foot maybe more and we're fighting the weather and we're fighting people our dirt man quickness is on a wednesday and rain is supposed to come in just any moment you see the clouds back here gathering darker and darker i'm stewing and i'm upset brother wayne's just pushing dirt finally we get that last truck in and he pushes it over smoothes it out and the bottom falls out and he i run and grab the truck come around grab him he jumps in it's about five o'clock on a wednesday and he has a look at him brother wayne i'm sorry i i don't know what to say i mean you're supposed to be preaching tonight he kind of looked at me with his look and kind of smirked he said well he said you know i was worried like that too he said until about 2 30 or 3 on on the dozer the lord came down and said i'm going to do something significant tonight i said brother wayne it's been real nice if you'd have told me right after that he kind of chuckled he's i'm sorry you know didn't even think about it when we go to the church or to the house he gets ready and my mom you know what just had her was that her first brain bleed yeah her first brain bleed and uh you know and she's in a weak condition and things but god has spoke a word and he backed it up i mean he's witnesses of it he backed it up he said i'm going to do something significant tonight oh hallelujah oh my we know what happened was there after midnight of god pouring out the blessings of god and we got testimonies even here i wonder how many could even testify and stand to your feet and say i i was healed during that night anybody here that could say that i know there's a couple here i know there's brother yeah brother jed there's one he had he had warts all over his body the doctors didn't burn off i don't know about a hundred or so still had them all over and they're gone today was everyone on here but i didn't realize there was a little girl had come down to an altar and said i want my brother saved and there was a word that was released and it was a creative word it was a word with power and it was released into another realm into another atmosphere over into a place where demons of hell had a boy bound and they had to back away at the presence of god and they backed away enough that he could get in his truck and come to the house of god hallelujah i say there's more words to be spoken against the enemies of god hallelujah it's time we put the word of god on our lips and go to speaking and saying god you promised it you said it and i believe it and i'm not backing away from it but i'm going to hold the promises high because i believe you're once again the same god what you did on that wednesday night you can do it again on this wednesday night you can heal you can say the loss oh let the word of god be released right now a word to go to room 106 and devils have to back up and release her in jesus name and healing virtues flow in jesus name and god come on the sea as he did for the three hebrew
