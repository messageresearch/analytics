amen that's important to believe god's prophet is a messenger to this last age amen god wants to do something special for us tonight i want you just to lock in as we just move into this realm change the order of the service and invite the lord to speak you know he's still the designer of the thoughts and intents of the heart you know he can repeat your conversation that you had this evening or

just reach out and touch the lord as he passes by your way this evening we trust something something to be said that i encourage you let's just go to him and pray our father what a great honor and a great privilege lord you've afforded us to be in your presence tonight father we thank you for the grace of god lord we thank you for your mercies they endure forever father even at this very present time lord a time of darkness upon the world as we would know it but father there is mercy that's been extended to the bride and lord we're so thankful tonight to be recipients of that mercy and of that grace lord to be loved by the father and to not only be love but to love the father as well so we're just asking father tonight that you would come by once again and speak to us father you know our hearts you know the things that we deal with the frustrations that we we go through but lord we're just gonna set those things aside tonight and invite you lord to come and just minister to our hearts you see the young the old the middle age all that are here lord i pray that you'll just be able to speak something that would minister to every heart that's in this building tonight and those that are on the stream so lord we just commit our lives to you and we just ask tonight father you'll anoint this service knowing not only the speaking of the word but also the receiving lord we ask it in jesus name amen tonight if you have your bibles we're going to look here in 2nd corinthians 4 and we'll start here at verse 7. and i want to speak to you i want to pick back up on god does impossible math as you're turning there god does impossible math this will be part 5. impossible math part five and i want to give it a subtitle tonight it's not the end of the story i was beginning to study this uh about a week and a half ago getting prepared actually for a youth service and the lord just kind of changed my entire thought for this service tonight but using this it's not the end of the story and my daughter lauren slipped into my study and i had it up on my computer she goes what are you preaching on she goes i don't know but i like the title i said well good so we'll just trust so if nobody else pulls tonight lauren i'm expecting you to pull wherever you are i don't even see you but she's so short oh there she is she's her father's daughter right second corinthians 4 and verse 7 but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us that's what we want tonight the excellent to be of god and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair we're persecuted but not forsaken we're cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body of the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus's sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have in the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believe and therefore i have spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with him for all things are not for all things or for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal way to glory while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal you can be seated tonight as i said we're going to speak to you when it's not the end of the story you know and just kind of looking back and not that i'm an idiot by any step of the imagination but i just kind of looked up the word story because i want to make sure i knew what story meant because we can get several opinions of what a story is if i was asked you tonight what's the definition but the definition of story is an account of incidents or events an account excuse me of incidents or events and we know there's true love stories there's fiction stories there's non-fiction stories there's animated stories there's all kind of stories uh that we know about but tonight i want to bring it down personal to you because we know that there's times in our lives that maybe our story didn't have such a great a great chapter in it maybe there was times it wasn't so glamorous maybe there was times in your life where you wish you could forget that portion if you could just erase that chapter erase that portion of that story and never think about it again there was days when you didn't walk with the lord and yet you are today because of that walk or that lack of that walk now you're reaping the repercussions of that and you wish that maybe you didn't or you wish that you could do it all over again and there's sad times in our store maybe you lost a loved one and now you're left trying to figure out how to navigate life alone because the spouse that you've been married to for many years is no longer there and yet your story is filled with emotions and maybe it's filled with anxieties maybe it's filled with a lot of stress and then there's exciting times then there's some doors that are open and things that are happening for you and you're flourishing and prospering and you got wonderful memories and you're cherishing all those and all these events make up your story but i don't want you to focus on all the events that are making up your story tonight i want to focus on how does your story end we all have a story here tonight and some of you you've made the right choices others you're on the path to make the right choices others you've not made that choice yet but i'm asking you to focus tonight on how does your story end and we look here in romans 8 and the bible would tell us in verse 5 for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity with god or against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can it be so then they that are of the flesh cannot please god so when you get into the flesh you're not pleasing god and that's why we find this here in romans 12 when we skip over to romans 12 and verse 1. the bible would tell us i beseech you excuse me therefore brother by the mercies of god that you present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and notice verse 2 and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind now the bible will tell us in chapter 8 that to be carnally minded is death that's why paul would tell us in chapter 12 you've got to have your mind renewed today and if there was ever a time in a generation and a people to be having their minds renewed is now there's so much pulling against you there's so much coming at you that now is the time young people that you got to have your minds renewed renewed by the word of god renewed by the holy ghost renewed by the baptism of fire in this hour so we finally to be carnally minded as enmity against god therefore we must have our minds renewed the best christian here tonight and don't raise your hand thinking you're that one but the best christian here tonight the most pies when you feel like your life just toes the line the bible would tell us that you were shaping iniquity and in sin did your mother conceive you so you were born in sin you were shaped in iniquity you came to this world needing your mind your thoughts your life renewed by the word of god we find here in genesis 2 verse 16 and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that you eat thereof thou shall surely die so notice man can eat of all the trees of the garden but the one in the midst of the garden don't touch it don't look at it don't partake of it or you're gonna die then we find in genesis three and verse one now the serpent he was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman notice now he begins to talk to the woman not the man he says yeah god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the tree of the gardens or the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat it neither shall you touch it lest you die so she was saying what adam had said she was speaking of her her earthly husband his commandment his word he knew that he spoke expressly with god and god told him if you eat thereof you're gonna die so she's having this conversation with the enemy or with the serpent and if she would have left off right here and no longer entertainment walked away from the conversation and went back to her husband and began to confess oh i had a conversation with him this is what he said and let her husband deal with it it'd have been a different story but we find she continued to entertain and she could continue to welcome the conversation because the devil always makes it appealing to the natural he always makes it appealing to the senses of the flesh and we find here the serpent began to speak back to her you shall not surely die how many you've ever been tempted and you stood on the word of god but then the enemy come right back said damn that's not gonna happen not for you look at you you're a good christian you got the holy ghost only to fall only to be tempted some of you young boys claiming you got the holy ghost and yet you you find yourself slipping up and looking at things you shouldn't look at and we find you want that but you're constantly entertaining the lie of the enemy he's putting this beautiful model in front of you but that's not beauty that's death because if you partake of that tree no there's nothing left but a death sentence atonia so the enemy would say for god knoweth that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil notice he began to reason with her and he reasons with all of us his tactics have not changed why we have to have our minds renewed by the word of god our thinking must be this word this word this word this word this word anytime satan presents you a a proposition you take them back to this word because heavens and earth will pass away excuse me but this word will never pass away so we find here and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise that she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did eat so we find the best christian here tonight your origin starts right here that birth where you were shaped in iniquity and came to the world conceived in sin starts right here there's not one of us here tonight that bypass this birth and we look at this scene here and it's an awful scene and you know god's original plan was for man to come by the spoken word but eve listened and she entertained the live the devil and she gave it she regarded it above her husband's own word and because she partook of the devil's lie and she laid with the enemy and she gave all to us also to adam and he partook of it what did he do it thrusts the human race into sin it thrusts the human race into slavery it thrusts the human race into bondage and now every one of us tonight we bypass our theophanies and we come into this world a sinner we come shaped in iniquity we come in sin otherwise we were born with the death sentence we were born with a destiny and the only way to escape the death sinus is to partake of the tree of life the only way to escape the sin's penalty is to partake of the tree of life and the prophet of god will tell us here in ephesian church age he says now the tree of life is a person he says trees throughout the scriptures refer to persons as in psalms 1. thus the tree of life must be the person of life and that is jesus so now in the garden of eden there were two trees the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil so we find one of those trees was a tree of life the other was a tree of knowledge of good and evil man was to live by the tree of life but he was not to touch the tree or the other tree or he would die but man did partake of that tree and when he did death entered the human race by sin and he became separated from god so if the tree of life is a person then the tree of knowledge and good and evil is also a person and we find that the bible will tell us in ezekiel 28 verse 13 that thou satan has been in the eaten the garden of god satan was there so our origin starts here and we find that the beast we know this very well he was close to a human he was an upright creature but he had he was pure animal he could reason he can talk he was between the chimpanzee and the man but closer to the man that his seed could mingle with the woman's seed and bring forth life and we find that the prophet god said that happened here in genesis 3 eve turned away from life and she accepted death said brother joe you're painting an awful picture you're exactly right sin is an awful picture there's no need to glamorize sin there's no need to say oh i've got it everything and yet you're a sinner and you're away from god sin separates you from god sin separates you from your sonship sin destroys families sin destroys life and i'm going to tell you there's nothing glorious about sin but i want you to know tonight church it's not the end of the story god has provided better things for them oh hallelujah notice now adam our first father he sowed the human race into sin into slavery so eve notice now eve she partook of it and they asked brother branham an ephesian church ager he claims it here he says now if he felt that way what did adam do for god laid the blame on adam and this is what adam did adam took her back adam took her back adam took her back she was part of him and he was willing to take the responsibility upon himself he would not let her go so eve conceived by him he knew she would he knew exactly what would happen to the human race and he sold the human race into sin that he might have eve for he loved her amen adam our first father sowed us into slavery nothing we had to do with it and we find today that satan and his minions and his devils and all these they come to you every day how many of you do satan come and knock on your door well some of y'all are really good christians aren't you you don't raise your hand you're scared to be called out but no we all we face the enemy comes every day tempting us and trying us and he's there to remind you that you are born a sinner notice i said to remind you that you were born a sinner not that you are a sinner but that you were born this way and if he can ever keep you beat down if he can ever keep you living below your god-given privilege then satan has control of your life but i want you to know tonight that's not the end of the story god has provided a substitute god had came himself god come down he condescended so that we cannot sin notice now you can't help being born the way you were born how many you would change your first birth everybody come on rachel that's when you raise your hand we don't we we didn't we we would rather not be born with sinful desires i don't know about you but i don't i mean i had enough of it and we deal with it on a daily basis we all are born and sins shaped in iniquity but you can't help your first birth you absolutely have no choice in the matter that era belongs to adam and since that time there's been a great battle raging in the human mind because the human mind was the place it was the battleground it was selected because decisions have to be made decisions are made in the human mind adam made the decision to take his wife adam consciously made the decision to to leave eternity and to push the human race into sin in an element of time so that he could take his wife back because she was born of his bone and flesh of his flesh what was adam doing he was showing what god was going to do through a lamb of god one day to take back sinful man and redeem him back because she was born of his bow and flesh of his flesh he wasn't willing to let her go oh hallelujah church i don't care the dirtiest one of me tonight he's not willing to let you go but he loves you and he's willing and he's able to take that responsibility and bury it on his shoulders decisions are made in the mind and that's where satan meets you and the decisions are he says because god made man that way so adam consciously made a choice made a decision and his decision is what sold man into sin and tonight we each have to make a decision what are you going to get out of this service you have to decide young man you have to decide tonight do you fully surrender and let your life be rewritten or do you continue on young lady do you surrender fully tonight and allow god to rewrite the narrative of your story or do you continue on in sin so we find there are decisions that's got to be made and tonight you can make your final decision you can make your final decision i want to go here to luke 15 and verse 11. luke 15 and verse 11. notice the battleground the mind decisions have to be made it said that there was a man he had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that followed to me and he divided unto them his living now if you look at this right here the son was saying father i would that you would die so that i could have my inheritance now and we go on to the story it says and not many days after the younger son gathered all together he took his journey into a far country he didn't just pack up and go to dixie inn he didn't just pack up and go to mendon or go to the house next door he went into a far country what are you saying brother i'm telling you sin will take you farther than you want to go sin will take you farther than you expect to go and sin will slowly but surely completely take control of every facet of your life sin will make the decisions that you make be dictated by its origin sin will control every decision you make if you let it there and the scripture will tell us that we keep going on here he says now and when he had spent all that he had there rose a great famine isn't that ironic now he's a bomb he got nothing no more money but yet there's a famine arises in the land and he began to be in want and he went and he joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into the fields to feed swine this young man made a conscious decision to go to his father and say father i want my and what belongs to me as if you were dead right now i want my portion so we can just let's just kind of bring this to modern day can we do that for just a little bit you know i can just imagine this young man someone like you young boys how many you're in a public school system man we got no public school we got one we got can we i would just say we got a couple how about that some of y'all are scared to even admit that say he's in a public school system and he's started hanging around the wrong boys and the wrong crowd and maybe his friends talked him into you know hey won't you come hit this fake pipe started vaping or hitting a cigarette you know vaping it don't smell you don't get to smell all of your clothes or the you know so we don't do cigarettes we do the vaping and maybe they talked you into taking that first sip of alcohol or maybe some low-grade drug take a hit off a marijuana joint or maybe look at this nudist magazine or something of that nature some porn and it just you make a decision notice you make a decision to look at this and he began to esteem what his friends thought over that of his father oh you could do this you do this you'd be cool man you'd be the coolest man in the church you'd be the coolest young boy at school i mean everybody knows your dad is loaded he's a rich man won't you just go to him and ask him for all the money that he owes you or that's due to you go ahead and get your inheritance and you think about just a little bit of alcohol we can have an alcohol party every night for a long time we can just live it up so he makes the conscious decision to go request this from his father but i want you to know young person no alcoholic ever takes that first sip desire to be an alcoholic no druggie ever takes that first hit with the idea that i want to be a junkie and i want my life controlled by drugs and alcohol but we find satan took reasoning and he takes reasoning and he attacked the word of god and he shook eve off the path that's right by reasoning human reasoning he says now the only way that he or she could have to god to disbelieve god's word it had to be appealing and satan knows how to make reasoning appealing he has to appeal to you and sin is very appealing satan makes sin so appealing to you so this young man didn't think that he's going to ask for this money because he was going to have an awful time in the world no he thought that man the lord or the devil then painted him a beautiful picture so he thought of what life was going to be like when he's out from underneath the shadows of his father when he's out from underneath the bondage of you've got to go to church and you've got to do this and you've got to do that oh you're going to live it up i mean he had painted him a glorious picture look you can have women you can have drugs you can have alcohol you can do whatever you want you're free in the world so he could think about was being out from under bondage all he could think about was i'm coming of age i want to be my own man he didn't ask for his portion thinking that he was going to end up in a pig pile he didn't ask for his portion because he wanted that to be his end he asked because sin was appealing because he thought he was going to live it up that first hit that first drag off a cigarette or a vape that first sip of a bottle brother adam tells this story and i don't mind saying it right here but this is in the conflict between god and satan he says i often thought as a young man i read about different nations and morals of the country and i heard different people tell about especially down in france down there in a place they called pig alley he said how that the people were so immoral this was a this was a very uh risque street there in france he says ah he goes out he goes i'll see them people down there women coming out you know reprobates and such old haggy look you know and and mean and he goes i went down the pig alley the first night me and three other ministers he goes brother what a surprise we got now satan is too smart for that he isn't going to produce something like that but some of the prettiest girls i've ever seen in my life was there appealing certainly since sin is appealing and attractive satan hasn't got forked horns and some pony a pointed tail he's not some john polycorn out there with a coat hanging on in his ears hanging down he's a slicker and sin is appealing sin isn't just rude like you think it is it's very appealing so he makes it appealing glitter and he finds he keeps changing the bait he used to you'd have to go to a store and get a magazine then the internet popped up and you could get it on your computer now if you've got a smartphone it's easily accessible any degraded debauchery sin you want to look at so this bible says that this young man wasted his substance luke 15 and verse 30 but as soon as thy son was come which hath devoured thy living with heartless notice he wasted everything that he had on harlots on riotous living it exhausted his body it debased his mind it ruined his soul it destroyed every aspect of his humanity because he was giving himself over to sin what a ugly story i'm telling you but i'm here to tell you tonight that's not the end of the story church we find this young man he's out of money we find him that he's now he doesn't have a job we look back and we see the lights got shut off he has no money to pay the bill he's been evicted from his apartment he's sleeping in a car or under a a bridge somewhere and no matter how bad his life has gotten he yet made the decision to turn home instead of turning home he goes and joins himself with a citizen in the land and begins to feed swine and if you know anything about the jewish culture pigs are detested they're unclean not only did he go and feed swine but he began to long for the food in which he was feeding them we could say this young man hit rock bottom there was nowhere else for him to turn but home and he refused to turn home see he had to make a decision instead of turning home he went farther and farther into sin and it took him further and farther into a refereeing life until he wound up in a pig slop feeding pigs and no doubt all the reports that the father received was your son just did this your son's doing this your son's doing this and doing this and doing this and your heart breaks and breaks and breaks and breaks because instead of turning to the lord instead of turning to the father he turns further to the world but that's not the end of the story you hear tonight that's got a loved one some of you that got sons and daughters out there that are wayward and running husbands and spouses i want you to know tonight it's not the end of the story oh i'm telling you if i was you tonight i'd be clinging to this it's not the end of the story brother joe i just got a report he did this and she did that and they're in drugs it doesn't matter this young man had went all the way from oh he was a wealthy son a son of a fluffy father and now he's living in a pink stop he got no money he's got no rest he's got no home he's got nothing but i'm here to tell you tonight it wasn't the end of his story god was just about to stop and shake him let me tell you a church god is here tonight to shake our young people let's shake our prodigals to shape those that are wavering and running from the lord he's here to do the shaking it's not the end don't you think it's the end god allowed the sinner to come you want that in a in a quote why did he ever let the sinner come why did god ever let our center come he had to let a sinner come for the purpose of him being a savior god had an attribute he's going to not only be a father but he's going to be a savior so notice so god could be a savior he let the man get sick because he's a healer he's just he has to be just and he has to put the tree of life and the tree of death before every man like he did adam and eve or he did wrong in the first place so before you tonight is a tree of life and before you tonight is a tree of death knowledge of good and evil you can choose to smoke your vape smoke your cigarettes look at your pornography take a hit off the bottle drugs whatever you want or you can choose the tree of life the only way back from the death sentence is to partake of the tree of life the tree of knowledge is going to take you further and further and further and further we find here now luke 15 verse 17 and when he came to himself what parent is longing for that day sister brother johnny longin for when they come shell malika jairus come to themselves oh we got prodigal church but we got a promise that's bigger than our prodigals did you hear what i said we got prodigals it's evident nathan's been running but we got a promise no matter how far he can run we've got a promise that he'll leave the 90-9 and he'll save that lost wayfaring lamb he'll go after that one if he'll cross the razing sea for some maniac on the other side had reached up in a moment and said dog god saved me and yet he was cutting himself and living in the tooth god didn't let that be the end of his story no he said the word there and the word released him from the bodies that he was in and i'm going to tell you tonight that same word will be released upon you and your young people and your son and your daughters if you can believe it that's a promise we need to hold on to notice now he came to himself and he said how many hired servants of my father's house have bread enough to spare and i perish with hunger now this word or this phrase here he came to himself means that he was deranged he was insane and any man that's away from god is insane you may think you're intelligent you're just an intelligent insanity you may think you're super smart you're super smart and stupid at the same time because you're deranged you're insane but notice now john 6 and verse 44 would say no man can come to me except the father which has sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day so no man can come to me except the father go and shake them and brother tim brought this out not knowing that i already had it in my notes the angel of the lord visited that fowl infested pig slop he went to that house where that daughter or that son was living with somebody else outside of marriage he went into that bar room let me just tell you personally like he did for me he came in my car on a night that i didn't want to live when a night that i thought it was the end of my story all but the angel of the lord and it's one of the only times he ever i've ever heard an audible voice in all of my life and it said turn your car around now i didn't have a christian upbringing i didn't understand what was going on all i knew is i heard the voice and i turned around so the angel of the lord visited me in my moment of despair he visited me when i was drunk and i wanted to take my life but he didn't leave me where he found me oh hallelujah he came my way and turned my life around and he came to this big infested pig sloth and he shook that boy you've been running long enough you've been waving long enough you've been away from home long enough you've been away from the father long enough arrive and go to the father's house arise and go to the father's house it's time that you arise and he says i will arise verse 18 i will arise and i'll go to my father and i'll say to him father i've sinned against heaven and before thee i am no more worried to be called thy son make me as one of our heart servants and he arose and he came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him because his father was holding on to a promise oh his father was holding on to a promise i gave you to god at the altar i'm gonna hold on to that promise that day and their offspring will be there i'm gonna hold on to it that is for you for your children even for your children's children to them that are far off in a far country it's for them too notice now when he was a great distance off his father saw him when he had compassion and he ran and he fell on his neck and he kissed him verse 22. but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on them and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring him to the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be married for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they begin to be married so we find here that this father began to run to his son now in this custom in the ancient near east this culture this this right here was frowned upon it was considered taboo because the father had to pull up his tunic up to his hips expose his legs and this was embarrassing it brought shame to the family but yet the father didn't care because it was his son that he was running to let me tell you our father doesn't care what he has to do he doesn't mind pulling up the tunic and running to you whatever it takes he's ready whatever it takes if that son begins to come home he's there to run to him he's there to embrace him he's there to show them love and support and i welcome him back to the family notice he didn't go and scold his son how dare you no he didn't scold him but he gave him a lavish welcome party notice what he said go get a robe we're going to change these old pitch slot robes or tattered clothes smelling like pig manure we're going to change your robe to change his dignity and god traded your old sinful robes you were born in sin but he said i'm giving you new robes i'm giving you new clothing because you can't get there with these clothes clothes on and so bags of filth notice he put a ring on his son's finger and in that day rings wearing rings during this time of history was a sign of both wealth and position so the father here was reflecting his desire to restore his son as a family member oh church aren't you waiting for the father to restore that son as a family member as a decent person in the community oh and the family of god god is here to restore god is waiting to restore and not only that but he put sandals on his feet so he says i want you son to walk with me you can walk with me without any fear you can walk with me without any worry about being contaminated by the things of this world i want you to walk with me and the last that he did was he slayed the fatted calf no longer would his son settle for the slop of the pigs but now he would die on the best meat available oh church what is this story telling us tonight that this is a fatted calf this is a robe of righteousness this is a ring of wealth and position the bible would tell the prophet of god with us he placed upon our hand our finger that wedding ring of predestinated unmerited grace what a position we're in what a place that we're in tonight to know that when the enemy would come in god raises up a standard when enemies tore your life down it and rub you through the muck of the world god is here to restore you i think about sister trish and brother george and i'll forgive me if this offends you but i just think about the first time i met brother george i'm like there ain't no hope for that man and sometimes we got loved ones we feel the same way there's no way there's nothing nobody can save that man look at him he's low down dirty run not you brother george but that that person out there and seeing oh he's in drugs and his teeth are all messed up and his hair is all messed up and he's disheveled he ain't got a home he ain't got a car he ain't got nothing all he's got is a ragged old wife and a ragged old kid and he's running them through the muck trying to make a living and he's living ain't gonna do nothing because he's bound by drugs and bound by alcohol and bound by sexist and bound by this and bowed by that oh let me tell you though it's not the end of the story god can take that same man and clean them up and put a robe on him and put a ring up when he rings a predestinated unmarried graceful and make him a deacon and clean him up and make him a real son of god it's not the end of the story now satan wants you to think that no matter how far god has to go he will go so it's not the end of the story was how can it be brother joe nobody's nobody cares it's not the end excuse me it's not the end of the story god has the final say for the george god had the final say sister trish god had the final say we look at those some of our loved ones and we wonder why they making these choices why are they doing this don't they realize who they're hurting maybe just maybe it's not the end of their story see god's not so much concerned about all the in-between he's worried about the end see the difference between us and god he knows the end and he can sit back and he can look oh yeah there's going there's coming a day i'm going to make my visitation because no man can come unless the father draws i'm going to go and i'm going to shake that prodigal son i'm going to go and i'm going to shake that prodigal daughter you say can god go to where they are absolutely if he can go to a pigsty surely he can go to his address surely he can go to his job surely maybe in a car maybe in the moments he's thinking about suicide surely it's not the end of the story so we find here what a sad story though but god said it's not over i got the final say and we go back and we look at adam and eve and we find here that adam and eve because they sin now they were being evicted from the garden of eden eve looking over at her husband adam crying tears in her eyes i'm sorry honey i did all this i should have not listened to the lobby of the serpent and i did this and i i'm sorry honey i brought you this shame and this this embarrassment and i didn't know what it was going to do and adam's embracing his nice beautiful blonde hair blue eyed wife and they're both crying and you know an atom with his strong body cauteringly leaned over on their bosom their tears mingling falling and running on the sheepskin and blood dripping down but we find god told them he says now you partook of that tree and i told you don't now you got to depart from my presence and not only were they crying but god looked down and god looked down went into me god looked down with sympathy and god more importantly looked down with love and he said that's not it just hold up a minute i'm gonna put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the serpent what was god foreshadowing that it's not over it's not the end of the story you may be leaving the garden but god was declared i'm gonna make a way that sinful man can come back in the presence of a living god oh you're being pushed out because you took of the tree of knowledge but i'm gonna make a way i'm gonna provide a lamb where you can partake of the tree of life and you'll never be from my presence again oh i'm gonna put enmity between your seed and the seed of the serpent so what did god do he accepted the substitute of man in the garden of eden and that was the only way was a blood sacrifice blood had to pay the price and it's still the price today you're not going to get in on your merits you're not going to get on on your family genetics you're not going to get in on who's who who you belong to it's only through the blood only through the blood let me skip down but you know the enemy's there go just a little bit longer tonight if you don't mind then it means they are always making accusations accusing you are failures accusing you and rightly the accusations for the most part are everyone true because you were born a sinner but he doesn't know that god's got another plan for your life so we find here in john 8 if you go to john 8 verse 1. jesus went unto the mount of olives and early in the morning he came again to the temple and the people came unto him and he sat down and he taught them and the scribes and the pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had said her in the midst they say unto him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act she's a dirty woman we called her red-handed what were you doing looking caught her red-handed but not only was it she should have been stoned he should have been stoned with her but they only brought the female because that's how satan does it because he's get he's talked you into doing these things but he's only accusing you so we find here that they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but jesus stooped down with his finger and he rode on the ground as though he heard them not and when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and he said unto them he that is without sin among you let him cast the first stone and again he stooped down and he wrote on the ground notice he wrote twice and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went one by one bringing in the eldest even unto the last jesus was left alone in the womb standing in the midst and when jesus had lifted himself up himself he saw none but the woman he said unto a woman where are those thine accusers has no man condemned thee verse 11 she said no man lord and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more so they brought accusations against this moment of adultery and she was caught in a very act and she should have been stoned but jesus stooped to the ground and i can just imagine the first time he stooped he wrote it's not the end of your story let he without sin cast the first stone stooped back down and he wrote pardon because he knew one moment in his presence is all it takes you may have walked in an adulterer or an adulteress but you're gonna walk out free see satan wants you to think that it's the end of the story all these accusations come against you and he is the accuser of the brethren and he's here to cover your life with skin or sin excuse me and scar and deface your life with drugs and alcohol and sex sins and failed marriages and failed relationships and bad business decisions and if he can't get you there he begins to fill your mind with fear and nervousness and complexes and anxieties and depression and suicidal thoughts anything that he can do to keep you a slave to your first birth but i want you to know tonight it's not the end little bride of the story oh i'm to tell you where is die accuse your little bride all the bible will tell us that the accuser of the brethren has been cast down oh little bride you may have done those things but in the beginning you've never done it in the first place but then in the beginning was in the mind of god and god saw you perfect god saw you sinless god saw you pure god saw you the virtuous pride of jesus christ he didn't see you in dirty old stuff because he saw you as his beloved wife he saw you as his beloved wife now notice the devil's there to accuse but jesus is there to intercede he came to redeem the elected that he foresaw and satan is there well i got adam to do this and i got his wife to do this and they're guilty but the lamb of god jesus christ is there to say no they're not because in the beginning i saw them i knew them they were boned in my bone and flesh of my flesh i knew what they would be and though they come down this way it's not the end of the story but you know satan will try to make you think you cross the line he tries to make you think everything's wrong with you brother ben has this young lady before he says you're nervous aren't you sister you can't hold it together sometimes sometimes you think you're almost going to take your life you wonder what's going to happen in in your religious experiences and so forth you've never been satisfied just exactly you've always wondered that's right is it true and you wanted a closer walk with him and then sometimes satan has told you recently when you're in the room by yourself you've crossed the line he goes i'm not reading your mind but that's true isn't it he lied to you sister you're healed right now and if you can believe the promise of god over the live enemy you can be healed right now it may not be a physical healing that you need but it may be a mental healing when you quit listening to the lie of depression and the lies of fear and the lies of nervousness and anxieties and complexes and you take god at his word oh church last brother branham my brother man says but god sent down from heaven a bleach for sin it was the blood of his son and when our confessed sins drops into the into god's bleach try to find it again that's all you got to do tonight sooner friend all you got to do is commit that thing to god and put it in the bleach of the blood of the word of god and you'll never find another trace of that sin god completely changed every desire for the things of this world he's got a and what this bleach does what does his bleeds do excuse me it dissociates there's a power inside that bleach that causes dissociation and when you get inside that blood and that blood comes all upon you i'm gonna take it'll disassociate you from the life of sin it'll take drugs out of your life it'll take pornography out of your life it'll take cigarettes out of your life it'll take the desires of the world out of your life i say pour the bleach on tonight god what happens to a son he becomes in perfect fellowship with the father standing on the other side of the chasm with no more remembrance of sin against him there is no more stain of bleach can be seen anywhere he is free you want to talk about a new story see all you can think about is what you were all he can think about is what you are oh my what a trade and if we can ever start thinking his thoughts if we can ever see ourself the way he sees us oh you won't come in beat down he won't come in all nervous he won't come in all depressed though you start thinking how god thinks about you god provided a blood the accuser of the brethren has been cast down we no longer belong to the devil we no longer belong to the bondage of drugs and alcohol and sin satan's may have tried to oppress you beat you down lie till you attack you but tonight you are god's free man tonight we are sons and daughters of god let me go just a few more minutes trying to find a stopping place john first john 3 and verse 1. first john 3 and verse 1 says behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now i said beloved now at 8 25 on march the 10th now we are the sons of god and it do not yet appear what we shall be because sometimes the only thing we can see is our failures and our mistakes but i'm trying to transition your mind from looking at your failures and looking at your mistakes and begin to look at you the way god sees you as my son as my daughter or me tell your church now we are the sons of god oh what has the god what has he done he has bestowed upon us his love he's bestowed upon us his title of sonship what is god or what is satan bestowed upon you nothing but hardships nothing but heartaches nothing but loneliness nothing but fears nothing but depression nothing but worry and guilt and regret and he's called you dirty rotten load down good for nothing but god is called your son he's called your son tonight it's not the end of your story you're not some dirty low down nothing you're sons of god god has come and he's changed the devil's plans about you [Applause] he's done wrote a new narrative oh we've been reconciled colossians 1 and verse 19 for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through god or through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven and you and you and you come on church and you and you we're sometimes alienated and enemies where in the battleground because you were thinking like the devil he was thinking like a slave he was thinking like a born sinner who was born in this world shaped in iniquity and you sometimes were alienated enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled you do you know what reconciliation means it means i'm an accountant so we do reconciliation all day every day things have to tie out to the very minute penny so you got a number over here and it may be xyz and over here is what makes up x y z if this over here doesn't equal this we don't reconcile so what did god say i'm going to reconcile my lost sons and my lost daughters so he provided a blood he provided a bleach and now that son can come underneath that blood and be reconciled you who were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked words now he has reconciled you now he's declared you sons and daughters and so you never sinned in the first place oh hallelujah you needed a lamb and he provided you a lamb you needed a substitute and what a substitute he provided but we find now as i bring this down down to a close in the beginning was the word the logos and the word was god and the word was with god and in verse 14 that same word became flesh because he knew what it would take to redeem your sinful soul he knew the cost and he counted it because like adam he loved this eve but unlike that eve this he's not gonna fall she's gonna stay true going to stay virtuous the bible will tell us in first john 3 and verse 9 whosoever is born of god doeth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god renews in the mind revelations 2 and verse 7 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life they were pushed out in the beginning couldn't partake of the tree of life and now in the end time now in the last they said brother this is the ephesian age but every reward of every previous age that last age receives all that blessing and so we find here those that overcome and laodicea get to partake of the tree of life and that's why we now have the holy ghost the tree of life and there's no more separation from us and god oh we looked at the beginning it was a sad story but the story's not over we find here brother brown would tell us he says what a thrilling thought this is the tree of life in the garden of eden which could not be approached until unto because of the fall of adam is now given to the overcomer now the tree of life is given to you in this last age so we find now these sons of god who by him overcome are giving the privilege of the paradise of god and in constant fellowship with jesus see satan satan wants you to think there's no way of escape he's got man corrupted he's got politics that he's got governments corrupt he's got the world's corrupted he's lied to you he's made you feel like healing is beyond you holy ghost is not for you you can't live above sin you got to remain as you are there's no hope it tells you there's no hope for you there's no hope for you see satan when you were born he took a pen out and he began to write all your failures wrote them down accusing you before god but they did this and andrew tuster did this little skateboard punk he did this and he was hiding it from his mom and his dad drinking booze behind her back skateboarding running with the wrong friends i got it all written down right here he took a pen and began to chart out things that you had done by the sinful nature oh and he began to write your story and you know he knew a little bit about it because he's the one that's talking you into it and you begin to look at this and you begin to look at that and you begin to do this and he's there just writing it all down and writing it all down but one day god snatched the pen away from the enemy and i believe god not only did it but he brought it down through a prophet in the pergamum church age he says one night i was seeking the lord and the holy spirit told me to pick up my pen and write sometimes we think this is all it is this life this is all it is all these things that you wrote down devil that's me yeah that's me and that's me i did this and i did that and i did that but god took the pen away from your accuser he took it away from the enemy and this is what god is saying about you right now he says in these last days the true bride church christ seed will come to the headstone she will be a super church a super race as she nears him day in the bride will be so much like him till they will be in his very image this is in order to be united with him this will be or they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the living god from this little group of true seed of god god will present christ with the beloved bride she is the virgin of his word she is the virgin because she knows no man's creeds are dogmas and by and through the members we'll know this bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to be manifest in a virgin satan about your shame but god has wrote about your translation god has wrote about you in a rapture he thrown a bunch in a body chain and he's called you the sinless pure sinless virtuous blood of jesus christ satan's told you low down dirty sinner but god is taking the pen away and he's changed the narrative you're not what the devil says you are you're sons and daughters of god you're children of god you've been redeemed of god musicians come he said there'll be a time to come forth when he would express himself in the fullness of the godhead deity through his church had the preeminence in his church oh my what the anointed man but now the anointed people amen now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed why accepting what eve turned down and adam coming back with his anointing of the word notice now what eve turned down was life and what you're being presented is life the tree of life it's not justin it wasn't the end of your story when satan says oh you're going to be out there a little rock and roll punk running away from the church and run away from the family and doing god knows what but one night on a wednesday night he took the pen away from your enemy and began to write you a new narrative for the philip running from the lord for a long time he looked up at a water tower and came to yourself derangement left delusion left why because you begin to see yourself as god sees you you're not bound by depression that's a lie the enemy if you ain't crossed the line that's a lie of the enemy you don't have to live with nervousness that's a lie of the enemy you don't have to be bound by fears you have to be bound by the devices of this world young person you don't have to be bound by pornography and pornography spirits no those are lies of the enemy that pertain to your first birth for the prophet of god will say that first marriage has been annulled [Music] because you have died out you're no longer what you used to be see instead of refusing the word we accept it the bridegroom came and took away our shame and now we stand just defied just as though we've never done it in the first place he says you talk about a thanksgiving because i feel real good i'm more thankful for that than anything i know this is what the prophet of god is telling you or what god is telling you through a prophetic voice you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god so when your enemy you meet him tomorrow and he comes and tells you well you this and you did this and i caught you in the act you come back and say i'm the sinless i'm the pure i'm the virtuous pride of the living god you young people are going to a youth camp tomorrow the devil's going to fight you every stretch because he don't want to lose his grip off your life and he's going to come and maybe you get into a service and you feel the anointing and yet he keeps you in your seat you remind them who you are i am the pure sinless virtuous bride of jesus christ i don't have to be bound by the cares of this life i don't have to be bound by pornography i don't have to be bound by cigarettes i'd like to be bound by alcohol i don't have to be bound by drugs i can be bound in the chains of love loving my lord jesus standing completely you never sin in the first place oh look at the narrative he is writing out about this bride you've never sinned in the first place it's in a sea of forgiveness you never did it you were accused of it by the brethren but really from the beginning you were the predestinated to be a son and daughter of god you're standing there washed your old book of divorcement is put away it's dead absolutely out of the existence even in the mind of god you're the virtuous bride of christ washed in the blood of christ your first wedding was annoyed notice you've never done it in the first place and we've seen the preview of the bride first bride walked out as i bring it to a close brother brown said she was beautiful elegant oh my what a beautiful bride she was and she was clean sweetest looking people i've ever seen she passed by sweetly with an air and the angel lord said that's the pride then he says i'm going to show you the church see sometimes we get hung up with seeing the church sometimes we get hung up young people we're seeing the church and the church came in dancing the rock and roll boogie woogie music oh worldly dress i actually didn't have much dress on to be honest with you brother brown say she was filthy looking and they were marching in time to twist to rock and roll and had a little gray paper holding in front of them like a lace hula skirt completely new from the waist up and was marching and twisting and carrying on and the backside completely nude he said that's the church brother bran i'm beginning to be dis disappointed is that all all my efforts all of our efforts that's all it's produced is that he said now it's not the end of the story i can just imagine i'm telling this prophet it's not the end of the story the bride's gonna come in preview one more time and here she'd come brother bam says she was exactly the way that first bride was beautiful elegant walked with an

joe gave a very very positive message tonight he told about very very positive endings but i want to talk about two young men just for a moment in the closing of the service there was moses he was a rich young ruler [Music] and he looked over at the treasures of egypt and he made a choice to go with the people of god to bear the reproach of god rather than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season let me tell you sin only lasts as a season the pleasures of it you never see the end you never see where it takes you never see the depths of sin the song says sin will take you further than you want to go it'll it'll keep you longer and you want to stay sure well that rich young ruler had a great ending but there was another young man that walked right up to eternal life jesus christ himself and said what must i do to inherit eternal life the end of his story when he turned away sorrowful because he realized what it would cost the end of his story didn't end so well he lifted up his eyes in hell we don't want that to be the end of your story but the decision's yours you'll choose today who you will serve i wonder if if the lord is dealing with you tonight and you know you need to make a move for god you know you need you need a touch from him you know the things that you've been doing that is wrong maybe we'll just start this way maybe you just raise your hand to to god right now and say lord i i realize i really need you i really need you i really need you god sees you he sees you you you you you you you [Music] yes we believe in predestination yes we believe

a move towards you and i pray now in the name of jesus you who have touched their heart tonight and they lifted their hand toward you and they made that move towards you may you just make a move toward them i pray lord their pillar will be so hard they can't sleep i pray lord their their life will become so difficult because of the conviction of the holy spirit speaking in the middle of the night and during the day you're wrong turn from that way until they turn back to you i pray the angel of god will get a hold of them and overtake them and bring them to an altar to a place of repentance i pray lord you'll never leave them alone until they return to you like a prodigal son i ask it in the name of jesus as we as you have moved upon their heart tonight you've spoke to them
