Gracious father, as we come into the house of the Lord this evening, as David said, I was happy when they said, "Let us go into the house of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Lord, we're a happy people to be called by your name. We're a happy people, Lord, to see the light of this revelation that you have, Lord, poured down in this generation, Lord. This restoration of the word, dear God.

We have just a few minutes aotted to speak. And I just want to share this as we close out 2025. We'll look here in 2 Timothy 4 and verse 6. It said, "For I am now ready to be offered &gt;&gt; and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, and I have finished my course, and I have kept the faith. &gt;&gt; Henceforth, there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all them also. &gt;&gt; You're included in Paul's statement. &gt;&gt; To them that love his appearing. So, you can have your seats this evening. I just kind of want to take a minute and if I would give us a little subtopic reflecting back to move forward and we find Paul as he's at the end of his life he begins to look over his life his ministry and no doubt he recalls the time where he sat at the feet of Galia and learned the words of God and maybe the times he wasted the years persecuting the church you know maybe the time he recalled when he was in era and didn't see the fulfillment of the word but he would say at the end of his life, at the end of his journey, I have fought a good fight. &gt;&gt; You know, Paul had fought a many a battle just like each of us, we have fought many battles and he reflects back and he says, I have kept the faith. &gt;&gt; You know, Paul would tell us in 2 Corinthians 11 and 24, he rec he recounts the times of his struggles. You know many times we want to testify the good things of God and we should and but also there's some difficulties along the journey that we face and Paul would tell us of the Jews five times received I 40 stripes save one thrice was I beaten with rods once was I stoned thrice I suffered shipwrecked and night and day have I been in the deep in journeyings often in perils of waters in perils of robbers in perils of my own countrymen in perils of the heathen in perils of the city, in perils of the wilderness, in perils of the sea, in perils among false brethren. Woo! Man, &gt;&gt; anybody want to be a Paul? &gt;&gt; In weariness and painfulness, and watchings often, in hunger, and thirst, in fasting often, in cold, AND IN NAKEDNESS, BESIDES ALL THOSE THINGS are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. &gt;&gt; And he says, "But who is weak, I'm not weak. Who is offended? I burn not. If I must glory, then I will glory in the things that concern MY INFIRMITIES. &gt;&gt; PAUL LOOKING BACK OVER his years, he would say maybe like this, I see clearly now what I what I couldn't see in the moment. &gt;&gt; The power that was sustaining me was never my own power, &gt;&gt; but it was God's power. &gt;&gt; And he would recall, I've been hungered. I've been in abundance. I've been with crowds that LISTEN TO ME PREACH EAGERLY. I'VE BEEN WITH MOBS THAT DRAG ME AWAY. I planted churches with trembling hands. I trusted THE SPIRIT OF GOD THAT WOULD NEVER THAT I COULD DO that he could do things that I never could. Transformed hearts and knit communities together, raise up leaders from ordinary MEN AND WOMEN WHOSE ONLY STRENGTH WAS CHRIST LIVING IN THEM. PAUL RECALLED THE GREAT THINGS THAT GOD HAD DONE THROUGH HIS MINISTRY. &gt;&gt; YEAH. But what did Paul cherish the most? It wasn't the miles, Brother Craig, that he traveled. It wasn't THE FANTASTIC SERMONS THAT HE PREACHED, BUT IT WAS the faces of brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; It was the faces of those that listened eagerly TO HEAR AND THEY HUNG ON TO EVERY WORD THAT PAUL PREACHED. AND HE WOULD BEGIN TO ESTABLISH THE GENTILE CHURCH. IT WAS THE FACES OF THOSE THAT GOD HAD ENTRUSTED TO HIS CARE, their faith, THEIR PERSEVERANCE, THEIR LOVE, and there were his crowning and his joy. &gt;&gt; And Paul was saying, "It was not the fruit of my clever words that did this, but it's been the power of God &gt;&gt; throughout time." And no doubt here he is toward the end of his life sitting in a Roman cell, parchment before him, chains resting on his wrist. Maybe he can hear the sounds of the city distant in the city there. And he reflects not on fame. He reflects not on accomplishments, the numerous churches that he was able to establish. He reflects not on the miles that he traveled, but on one simple truth. It was never my strength that carried me, &gt;&gt; but it was always his. &gt;&gt; And when any man thinks that it's him, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; doing it, then he's away from God. &gt;&gt; He remembers the road to Damascus WHERE HE WAS AMBUSHED BY GRACE and he turned from unbelief TO BELIEVING. AND I TRUST that each of you remember that moment. &gt;&gt; You can reflect back to that time where grace ambushed your life &gt;&gt; and you made a turn and you made A CHANGE. I'LL NEVER FORGET THE NIGHT THAT GOD SPOKE to me &gt;&gt; when I was going 120 miles the wrong direction and he said, "Turn your car around. &gt;&gt; I've never been the same since, church." &gt;&gt; You say, "Why do you share that?" Because I've never been the same. &gt;&gt; It's a part of who I am. &gt;&gt; No doubt. He remembers all night prayer meetings, nights spent in prayer tears that were shed over loved ones. He remembers the beatings, the shipwrecks, the hunger, the loneliness. And yet over all of it, one theme arises, and that's God's power was made perfect &gt;&gt; in my weakness. &gt;&gt; See, Paul recognized he was a man of weakness, but he also recognized that the God that he served was not weak. &gt;&gt; And I believe if Paul could speak to the church today, his reflection might sound a little bit like this. I was not the hero of my own story. Good. &gt;&gt; Christ was &gt;&gt; beautiful. &gt;&gt; I planted, &gt;&gt; Apollos watered, &gt;&gt; but God gave the increase. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every step I took, EVERY SERMON I PREACHED, every soul that was transformed, it wasn't me, but it was Christ in me, &gt;&gt; the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; And I want you to recall and remember this. It's what we do for Christ &gt;&gt; that lasts. You may go a lot of places. You may do a lot of things in this life, but it's what you do for Christ that counts. &gt;&gt; And Paul is there waiting and he's &gt;&gt; he he he says one thing. I have fought a good fight &gt;&gt; and I have finished my race. &gt;&gt; But through the ups and through the downs, he says, I have kept the faith. &gt;&gt; And through his ups and his downs, he remained steadfast. And I believe just for a minute now is if we look back when we started 2025, brother Murphy Wong was here and he ministered to us on look and live and he made a comment. People are so easy to forget what God has done. &gt;&gt; And I say even the light tabernacle church of the living God, may we never forget what God has done in our lives, &gt;&gt; where he has brought us from &gt;&gt; and where he has taken us to. Amen. &gt;&gt; As we reflect back, I believe we can say like Paul, I fought a good fight. &gt;&gt; There's been a lot of battles along the journey, but I'm still standing. &gt;&gt; We've kept the faith. Satan has done everything he could to destroy us, but we're here tonight. &gt;&gt; As a testimony of God's grace and his mercy. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham and brother Craig, you shared this quote Sunday and he says, "Now, today as As we face the new years, I want to think not like the past, but I want to look to the future. As Paul said, forgetting those things that were in the past, I pressed toward the mark. See the high calling. NOW, WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PLACE the message today as though through a rearview mirror. It would take too long. See the things that the Lord has did. And you all are acquainted with the great things that our Lord has been doing and some of the mightiest things that I've ever seen in my life. just passing. He said just in the passing of the last few MONTHS AND BUT NOW WE'RE THANKFUL FOR WHAT he's has been, but we're looking forward. We're looking where we're headed for and into this 19 and 64. &gt;&gt; I would say into this 20 and 26. &gt;&gt; And brother B makes a couple statements. You you know, if you can't drive a car looking in the rearview mirror, you're going to wreck up. &gt;&gt; But you know what? You must glance back. And you're ever going to determine where you are, then you have to reflect back on where you started. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And each of you here tonight, whether you're young, whether you're old, you have a starting point. &gt;&gt; You have a place where your candle got lit. I can recall that, you know, Brother Bam shares a testimony of that that colored sister there and she'd say, "I'm not what I ought to be. I'm not what I want to be, but praise God, I'm not what I used to be. &gt;&gt; CHURCH, WE'RE REFLECTING BACK TO look forward &gt;&gt; in 2025. Many of you realize and and understand that I've done a lot of preaching out there in the state of California amongst the Hispanic people. Over the last two years, I've spent a lot of time out there building their confidence and their trust that a lot of the churches there broke away from the return ministry movement. done a lot of things with question and answers and services, blending into their culture, you know, devouring their wonderful authentic Mexican food and different things of that nature. But at the end of 24, at the beginning of 25, I preached in Phoenix, Arizona for brother Elas Nahara. And Sister Jana, she came to that meeting. And it was in that meeting that she fully walked away from her Pentecostal denomination and fully embraced the message. And a few short months after that, brother Timothy and brother Tim would go there and they would hold some meetings there and and just a tremendous outpouring of God's grace. And brother Tony Mahias, who was an apostolic preacher, uh his his children, they all go to the church there in West Cavina, he walked away from the apostolic denomination and received the message fully and has been a an ardent uh labor amongst the brothers there to preach the gospel and to, you know, to embrace the message. And it's been through various ministries, brother Ray Muse, Brother Andrew Glover, Brother Andrew Spencer, Brother Flint Tape, Brother Aaron Oglesby, Brother Tim, BROTHER TIMOTHY, THAT GOD has began to open the eyes of the Hispanic culture of the Hispanic people there and bring them into the opening of the word &gt;&gt; the way that brother Brandham intended. The youth are catching the inspiration and God has done such tremendous things even among brother Johnny's children there. And toward the latter part of 25 back in October, I traveled to Mexico with brother Johnny. And it was during these meetings that their divine healing happened. As I was preaching the the word, this one got healed and brother Johnny's mom got healed in the meeting and several pastors came to the altar in tears. Realized that there's more to this message than what they knew. &gt;&gt; And they begin to embrace and hunger for it. And in 25, I did my first wedding ever. And it was a Mexican wedding. I'm going tell you, it's unlike anything you've ever been a part of. But it was great. We baptiz or we we married brother Gio Avala with sister Odrina and there and then 25. One of the greatest things that I would say that took place was I had the honor of baptizing my son-in-law after preaching. He come to me in the back. He says, "I know I don't have it. What do I need to do to get it?" I said, "Well, were you baptized?" He says, "Yes, I've been baptized when I was eight." I said, "There's a lot of water under that bridge. You're welcome to get rebaptized." And he said, "I want to do it." So his dad and I, Brother Brad Powell and I baptized Wesson. And a couple months ago, God filled him with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You say, "The things that I'm telling you tonight, these are not the things of any one man. These are not the things that man can do, but this is the work of God." &gt;&gt; And I want to just end with this as I share 1 Corinthians 3:6. Paul again, I have planted. Apollos watered, but God gave the increase. &gt;&gt; So then, neither is he that plantth anything, neither he that waterth, BUT IT'S GOD THAT giveth the increase. Now he that planth and he that waterth, they're one. And every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor. For we are laborers together, &gt;&gt; brothers. We are laborers together. We need each other as much as we need each of you here. And and Paul will say, "And you are God's husband husbandry and you are God's building according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder. I have laid a foundation another buildeth their own. But let every man take heed how he buildth their upon. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Christ Jesus." And in verse 21, therefore let no man glory in men, for all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cphus or the world or of life or death or things present or things to come, they're all yours and you are Christ and Christ is God's. So I'm honored to stand here with these brothers today, Brother Tim, Brother Timothy, Brother Aaron, and other great men like Brother Craig, and different men around the world that are standing for this message. I'm honored to stand with each of you [clears throat] and call you my brother and sister, but more importantly to call you my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I recognize that when we go out on the field and we visit the various churches we go, we don't go along. You go with us. You're praying for us, praying for successful meetings. And until we leave this world, I want us to take a moment just to reflect back of when your journey got started. recount the great victories, the difficult struggles, but also the recollections of how far you have come. &gt;&gt; And I want to say thank you for your love and your support through the years. You have been longsuffering watch a young man mature into a preacher. &gt;&gt; A lot of flubs, a lot of Joe isms, a lot of mistakes, but you've been merciful and graceful to allow this man to become what God has desired to use him. I want to thank you for your prayers. I want to thank you for your text and your encouragement as the ministries bless you throughout times in your life. And as we close out 2025, may we end this year the way we started it. As brother Murphy Wong said, look unto Jesus, the author and the finisher of our faith. Sister Jessica, if you would come and have your song. Look and live. We're going to keep looking forward to his coming &gt;&gt; until these bodies are changed. &gt;&gt; God bless you, church. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I concrete. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I dedicate my life, [singing] my will to thee, oh Lord. If [music] you can use these [singing] hands, if you can use this voice [music] all for your [singing] kingom and your glory, Lord.

Be a willing [singing] vessel that you can use. [music] [applause] Hallelujah. Have you enjoyed the evening so far? &gt;&gt; Amen. Enjoyed the what brother Joe [music] had to say this evening and expecting each one. Amen. [music] And it's it's reminded me of this song I've had on my heart for several days, several weeks now. And if you know it, I'd just love for you to sing [music] it with me. I think sometimes it's wonderful to stop and reflect on what the Lord has done for us. Amen. Man, he's been so good to us. I remember [singing] how you provided, how you held [singing] me through the night. And I remember how you sustained me [singing] when you stepped in to save my [singing] life. And if I knew then [music] what I know now, I would be [music and singing] still and let you work it out. [singing] Oh Jesus, I was tossed in the water, [singing] but [music] I never went under. You [singing] were [music] always on time, Jesus. When I [singing] went through the fire, you were right there beside me. [singing] You were always [music] on time. You were always, always, always [singing and music] on time. You were always always always [singing and music] on time. And I [singing and music] remember how you car [music] when I [singing] could not take a step. [music and singing] Oh, and I remember how you love me. I remember how you love me [music] when I could [singing] not love [music] myself. If I knew then or if I knew then [singing] what I know now, [music] I would be still and let you work it out. Oh Jesus, [music and singing] I was tossed in the water, but [music] I never went under. [singing] You were always on time. And [music and singing] Jesus, when I went through the fire, you [music] were right there beside me. You were always [music] [singing] on time. You were always always [singing and music] on time. You were always [music and singing] always always on time. There's never been a day, never [music and singing] been a minute, never been a moment that you weren't in. Never been a time that you [singing] didn't see me through God. So I worship. Oh, can we stand and sing it? There's never been a [music and singing] day, never been a minute, never been a moment that you weren't [singing] in me. Never been a time that you [music] didn't see me through God. So I [singing] worship you. There's [music] never been a day, never been a minute, never been a moment that [music and singing] you weren't in it. Never been a time that you didn't see me through God. So I worship [singing] you. [music] There's never been a day, never been a minute, never been a moment. [singing and music] Oh, think about it. Never been a time that you didn't see me through God. [music] So I worship [singing] you and Jesus. I was tossed in the water [singing] but I never went under. You were always on [music and singing] time. Jesus, when I went through the fire, [music and singing] you were right there beside me. You [singing] were always &gt;&gt; Oh, just tell them, [music] Lord, [singing] you're always [music] always on time. You [singing] were always always [singing] on time. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Have you found him to be always on time? &gt;&gt; Through the fire, through the flood, [music] times when you didn't know how you were going to make it, &gt;&gt; but he was always right on time. Amen. We thank him for that. [music] That he's so mindful of us, watching over and keeping us. Amen. Amen. Ain't it good to serve the Lord? &gt;&gt; It's brought us through another year, &gt;&gt; 2025, moving [music] into 2026. &gt;&gt; I tell you, seemed unimaginable. You know, Brother Tim was in the back talking about he said, "You remember the year 2000? How everybody's going crazy." And that just seems like a a blink. &gt;&gt; Things are going faster and faster and seems crazier and crazier. I'm thankful tonight [music] we have promises from a faithful God. And no matter how crazy things get, I'm so glad to be serving him &gt;&gt; going into 2026. I'm glad to be doing it with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles, we're going to read one verse of scripture tonight. Amen. God is [music] so good to us. If you'll look in Ecclesiastes 3 and verse one. Ecclesiastes 3 and verse one. We're just going to read this one verse here. Says, "To everything there is a season, a time to every purpose under the heaven." Amen. You can have your seats this evening. And just want to speak for just a moment. If I would were to title this tonight, I would just say constant through the seasons. Constant through the seasons. And if if you were to read on down through that verse, it would just, you know, for the sake of time, I didn't read it that chapter, but it goes on and describes so many different things that says there's a time for for everything. And and basically what we learn is that seasons and times and things are always changing. And and we know that the calendar turns and and with that seasons change and seasons within a year, you know, spring and summer and fall and winter, but but even seasons within our lives are are constantly changing and our lives are are moving and and seasons of I guess we would say celebration come come and go. We we have a Thanksgiving and then we move into Christmas and and there's different seasons throughout the year where there's celebrations and things like that. And and you know, like I said, we've just come through Thanksgiving and now through the Christmas season and and it's times of the year really that when it comes to God and and and and his faithfulness, the the world has completely disregarded those things from those seasons. They they've kind of turned them into a time of realry for the sake of realry and and they've forgotten what those things are are truly about. And there's there's no worship involved. And there's there's nothing nothing sacred anymore about those times. But but to a believer, the importance of the season we've just come through really cannot be overstated. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would say, "If there had been no Christmas, there would be no resurrection." &gt;&gt; How many are thankful for the resurrection? &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Had there been no Christmas, there'd be no resurrection. If there had been no Christmas, there had been no love. &gt;&gt; There had been no peace. there been no hereafter for the believer if there had been no Christmas. And so for for the season that we've just come through and and the Christmas time, it's it's it's extremely important because we recognize why it's important. We recognize why we're stopping and pausing and worshiping and and giving God God glory. So with the truth of Christmas and the re and and the realization of what it really means, it becomes a time of worship unto us. Amen. And it's a time to pause and to remember. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like brother Joe said, it's a time to pause and and to remember and and to give thanksgiving for for all that God has done in our life. And and remembering that he came in flesh so that he could give his life. &gt;&gt; I mean, he came as Emanuel so that he could be the kinsman redeemer. so so that his life could come back into your life so that you could then be an overcomer in the day that we live in. Amen. I I'm I'm thankful as you look back that that God made a way for the Old Testament saints and he made a covering, but we recognize that it was just foreshadowing what was to come and and we no longer have to go year after year after year and sacrifice after sacrifice because he came as Emmanuel, because he came to be a kinsman and and he walked like us and he and and he talked like a man and he faced human battles and he overcame as a human and therefore the spirit that was within him could come back on you and tonight. Amen. And and so because of that, what we've just come through is a wonderful time. &gt;&gt; It's a marvelous time. It's a It's a time of family. It's a time of worship. And and during this time, it seems like just human nature. It seems like we think about him more. &gt;&gt; We think about the gift that he gave more and we and we pause and we talk about it and and that's all good and and that's great and and I love it. But I want to challenge us as we enter into 2026 that we don't need a day or a season to be thankful and to remember. &gt;&gt; We don't have to wait till to to to certain times of the year and and you don't let the closeness that you feel and and and the love that we feel and all that comes with this season just be like some sort of seasonal decoration that gets put away when the season changes. &gt;&gt; This isn't a seasonal relationship. It wasn't a seasonal gift. It wasn't a seasonal thing we received in this day, but it's something of eternal value. It's it's something of eternity. And it's something we can be thankful for and praise him for every single day of the year. Amen. And and and and maybe the season that was set aside to honor the birth of Christ may may have come to an end, but I believe that our praise and our worship and our adoration should be constant through the seasons. &gt;&gt; Amen. It should be constant. And and as we come through 2025 and and this holiday season ends, you you know, it seems like every time we reach this point in the calendar that that folks kind of go into a bit of a drag, &gt;&gt; they kind of go into those January, February blues. &gt;&gt; But don't let your relationship with him go there. &gt;&gt; Don't don't hit this time of year and and and hit a drag. Don't let your passion for him go into a lull, but but make it a purpose tonight as we enter into 2026 and purpose in your heart that I'm going to give him more than ever. I'm going to serve him more than ever. I'm going to surrender more of who I am. Amen. What do I need to do, brother Aaron, TO HAVE A CLOSER WALK? LAY DOWN more of yourself TONIGHT AND SAY, LORD, I WANT MORE OF YOU GOING INTO 2026. I'M going to be more aware of him AND REMEMBER HIM THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. &gt;&gt; I'm not waiting for a Thanksgiving day or a Christmas season. THOSE THINGS ARE WONDERFUL, BUT BUT I'M GOING TO REMEMBER HIM IN FEBRUARY and January and on Tuesday and on Monday and every day OF THE WEEK. LORD, YOU'RE WORTHY OF IT ALL EVERY SINGLE day of my life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our worship isn't contained to a season. &gt;&gt; Our worship isn't contained to a day, but I want my life to praise him every day. I want my life to thank him every day that he came and he took on flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; We can never thank him enough and and praise him enough and and and and you know that same remembrance that that we speak of around Christmas because you know we we say it's time to remember and and we pause and we pause and and and and we thank him for the wonderful love gift and we slow down and it seems like we begin to draw closer and think on him and his life. But what I'm saying is let's hit pause more regularly. &gt;&gt; Let's hit pause all year long and remember him and honor him and thank him every day because seasons change &gt;&gt; but he doesn't. &gt;&gt; Seasons change but God is constant. Seasons change but Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; The years change but what he did by coming in flesh and dying for us was an eternal gift. It was an eternal sacrifice and it's not contained to dates or seasons. Prophet of God says Jesus Christ his own son that that he spared not to provide an eternal sacrifice for every generation that would follow Jesus Christ. Every generation after that would never have to look again for a sacrifice. Amen. But God provided everything the human race had need of in Jesus Christ. It was good in 2025. It's gonna be good in 2026. Amen. &gt;&gt; Calendars change, &gt;&gt; but God doesn't. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus Christ is the same. So, so as we stand here on the brink of 2026 and we look ahead, let's look ahead with a renewed zeal. &gt;&gt; Let's look ahead with a renewed dedication and a constant remembrance. &gt;&gt; A constant thanksgiving because he isn't seasonal. He isn't a seasonal God, but he's with us every moment of every day. &gt;&gt; Even as we begin to enter into the unknown, and you say, "What's the unknown, brother?" Tomorrow, &gt;&gt; it's unknown. &gt;&gt; 2026, really, it's unknown. And as we begin to enter into that, don't enter into it fearfully. &gt;&gt; Don't enter into it with trepidation and and and with all kind of worries and stress. But let's go forward knowing that the calendar has changed, but the promises have not. &gt;&gt; The calendar HAS CHANGED, BUT GOD'S word is still true. God is still true. HE'S STILL FAITHFUL. HE'S GOING TO SHOW UP FOR YOU RIGHT ON TIME, JUST AS HE ALWAYS HAS. THE CALENDAR is changing, but the truth is not changing IN 2026. AMEN. GOD'S GOING TO KEEP HIS WORD. GOD'S GOING TO FULFILL HIS PROMISES. GOD'S STILL GOING TO HEAL, AND HE'S STILL GOING TO SAVE. AND HE'S STILL GOING TO DELIVER. AND HE'S STILL GOING TO CALL YOUR LOVED ONES BACK. HE'S STILL GOING TO DO IT. HE'S STILL GOING TO HAVE A BRIDE WITHOUT SPOT OR WRINKLE OR ANY SUCH THING. HE'S GOING TO HAVE A RAPTURE. IT MAY NOT HAPPEN IN 2026, BUT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AMEN. God is going to keep his word. &gt;&gt; I don't know what's ahead in this year, but I know I'm not going into it empty-handed. &gt;&gt; I'm going into this year with promises in hand. I'm going into this year with his word on my lips. I'm going into this year with with faith in my heart. There's many things that we're holding on for. You know what you're holding on for. You know what promises you're holding on for. There there's many miracles that we're expecting to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; And yet, there's many trials &gt;&gt; and many twists and turns that we don't see coming just ahead. &gt;&gt; I don't say that to to scare you or worry you. If you've lived even a little bit, you know that's going to happen. &gt;&gt; You know there's things coming that that that you don't know about and and and and you're going to have trials and things in 2026. But I can look forward tonight with courage. &gt;&gt; I can look forward tonight with courage and boldness knowing that I do not walk into this year alone. I do not walk into these battles alone. I walk into 2026 anointed. &gt;&gt; I walk into 2026 just like David. There may be a valley and there may be a giant, but I've been anointed to rule and reign. There may be a valley and there may be a giant that I have to face, but I've been called in this day to be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; I have promises for 2026. Amen. Do you have promises for 2026? Well, they were given by an unfailing God and an unchanging God. So, that God is going to bring them to pass. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And whatever I face, whatever you face, you can face them knowing and sure that you're going to come out victorious. &gt;&gt; But brother Aaron, what what ABOUT WHAT ABOUT WHAT IF I DON'T SEE SOMETHING COMING AND IT JUST CATCHES ME OFF GUARD? That's going to happen. &gt;&gt; That's going to happen. &gt;&gt; David did not wake up looking for a Goliath that day. &gt;&gt; He did not wake up thinking, "Today I'm going to cut off the head of a giant." &gt;&gt; That's right. What was he doing? He was just door dashing for his brothers. &gt;&gt; He was minding his own business, &gt;&gt; bringing groceries. &gt;&gt; But he was walking with God all the time. &gt;&gt; When you're at school, walk with God. When you're doing your yard work, walk with God. When you're washing dishes, walk with God. When you're cooking dinner, walk with God. And when Goliath shows up, you ain't going to have to worry one thing about it. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WALKING WITH GOD, YOU'RE going to be victorious. Amen. In 2026. Amen. Amen. I don't know what Goliath IS GOING TO SHOW UP in in in in 2026, but when he does, you're not going to be afraid. &gt;&gt; DON'T BE AFRAID BECAUSE YOU CAN LOOK BACK AND SEE THE LINES OF 2024 AND HOW GOD BROUGHT YOU THROUGH AND THE BEAR OF 2025 AND HOW GOD BROUGHT YOU THROUGH. AND IF IT WAS good in 24 and IT WAS GOOD IN 25, IT'S GOOD ENOUGH TO BRING down Goliath in the year 2026. Amen. Because we're overcomers. &gt;&gt; We're overcomers. That's what we do. And we're not going to go down in defeat. Our God is constant through the seasons. Amen. &gt;&gt; He never leaves us. He never forsakes us. &gt;&gt; Like to close tonight with a few scriptures. Deuteronomy 31:6. This is words for us as we go into this new year. Be strong and of good courage. Fear not, nor be afraid of them, for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee. He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. &gt;&gt; Psalms 23 and4. Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. &gt;&gt; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Isaiah 41:10. Fear thou not, for I am with thee. &gt;&gt; Be not dismayed, for I am thy God. I will strengthen thee. Yay, I will help thee. Yay, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. &gt;&gt; The last words that Matthew would record in his gospel, Matthew 28:20, lo, I am with you always, even until the end of the world. &gt;&gt; Church, he's constant. &gt;&gt; He's with us every moment of every day. constant through the seasons. &gt;&gt; Let's live for him like never before in 2026. &gt;&gt; Let's seek him more &gt;&gt; in 2026. And I leave you with what brother Brandham would say to his congregation one night during this same season. We want to say we appreciate you so much. We want to wish you a merry Christmas and the best of the new year. God be with you and give you new things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who wants that? Lord, give me give me new, deeper, greater than I've ever had before. &gt;&gt; He said, "God bless you, be with you, and give you new things, more of the new life that you're seeking and hungering for." That's what I'm doing myself. I'm hungering for more of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you in the new year. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ask Sister [music] Jessica in the choir to come. And oh, I want to see him look upon [singing] his face [music] there to sing forever of the Savior's grace. [music] And on the streets of glory, [singing] let me lift my voice. Oh, [music] cares all pass. Home at [singing] last ever to [music] re Oh, I want No, I want to see [singing] him. Look upon his face.

Oh, I want to see [music] him. Look upon his face. Dare [music and singing] to sing forever of his saving grace. [music] And on [singing] the streets of glory, let me lift my voice for [music and singing] my past home at last ever to [music] rejoice. [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I was lost in shame. [singing and music] Could not get past my flame until he called my name. I'm so [singing] glad he changed [music] me. Darkness held me down. But Jesus pulled me out. I am no longer [singing] found. I'm so glad he changed me. See, I [music] now a new creation [singing] in Christ. The old has gone there to life. I live [music and singing] by faith by sight. There is [music and singing] a name that's written down in glory and it's mine. Yes, he's mine. [music] I [singing] met the author of my story and he's mine. Yes, he's mine. [music] And it left me [singing] blind. But Jesus opened my eyes. [music] Now I see the light. I'm so glad he changed me. Now I'm [music and singing] walking free. I've got the victory and it's all over me. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he changed me. Say I now a new creation [singing and music] in Christ. The old is gone there. I live by faith [singing] on my side. [music] There is a [singing] name that's written down in glory. [music] And it's mine. Yes, it's mine. I met [music and singing] the author of my story and he's mine. Yes, he's mine. [music and singing] There is a name that's written down in glory and he's [music and singing] mine. Yes, he's mine. I [singing] met the author of my story and he's mine. [music] Yes, he's mine. I am [singing] who I am because the I [music] am tells me who I am. I am who I am because the I am tells [singing] me who I am. I am who I am because [music] the I am tells me who I am. I am who I [singing] am because the I am telling who I am. [music] written name that's [singing] written down [music] glory and he's mine. Yes, he's [singing] mine. [music] I've been the author of my story and he's mine. [music and singing] Yes, he's mine. There is a name that's written [music and singing] down in glory and he's mine. Yes, he's mine. I met [music and singing] the author of my story. And he's mine. [singing] Yes, he's mine. And he's mine. [music] Yes, he's [singing] mine. And he's mine. Yes, he's [music] mine. Oh, Jesus [singing] is mine. [music] Hallelujah. Jesus [music and singing] is mine.

[singing] Everywhere I go, [music] everywhere [singing] I'll be, oh Jesus is [singing and music] hallelujah. Hallelujah. [music] Aren't you glad Jesus is yours tonight? Amen. Aren't you glad that he's been with you throughout this past year? Aren't you glad you have the assurance he'll be with you every hour? &gt;&gt; Amen. In the year to come. &gt;&gt; For he said, "I'll never leave you or forsake you." &gt;&gt; What a promise that is. &gt;&gt; What a glorious promise. Amen. How we love the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; We appreciate him. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to go to the book of Ecclesiastes also verse chapter um 3 and verse 14. So we'll just we'll just pick up on that same chapter where brother Aaron left off. He said, "I know that whatsoever God doeth, it shall be forever. &gt;&gt; Nothing can be put to it, &gt;&gt; nor anything taken from it." and God doeth it that man should fear before him. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. Tonight we are standing here at the edge of time. Not just a new year, you know, but we are right here where we're we're we're facing from time into eternity. &gt;&gt; And there's a blending of the seasons. But we're not here to announce something new. We are we are here to recognize what God has already done. &gt;&gt; And because we serve a God who doesn't experiment &gt;&gt; and he doesn't revise his word and what he begins, he finishes. And what he finishes is stands forever. &gt;&gt; It cannot be changed. And as we close one year and we step into another, we're not gathering here tonight just to turn the the page of a calendar. &gt;&gt; But we are here to discern a divine moment of where we are standing here realizing that God works in seasons and when a season closes, he doesn't lo leave a bunch of Lucians behind. And and of course as we remember the words of the prophet that we have focused upon in this past year as we will reflect back and also think of where God has led us in this past year through the word. Zechariah said that he shall bring forth a headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it. Amen. And &gt;&gt; we can realize that the favor THAT GOD HAS SHOWN us in the year past that that favor will continue in our lives. &gt;&gt; And and because God will not end his work in confusion. &gt;&gt; He ends it with a capstone. &gt;&gt; And that capstone of course is not a program. It's not a movement. It's not an idea. It is Christ himself &gt;&gt; returning to his church as a head as a word, as life. And and when the capstone comes, it doesn't come to an unfinished building. &gt;&gt; It comes to something that has been measured and aligned and brought to maturity. &gt;&gt; AND SO TONIGHT, IT'S NOT ABOUT EMOTION. It's not about hype. It's about recognition. &gt;&gt; It's recognition that God has been speaking to us this year. &gt;&gt; It's a recognition that something has been closing. a recognition that the same God that began this work is now bringing it into completion. &gt;&gt; As Paul said in Philippians, he said, "Being confident of this very thing, that he that begun a good work in you will perform it to the day of Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and that work is not just in the church ages, but it's in you. So let every HEART TONIGHT JUST QUIETEN THEMSELVES BEFORE God and and LET OUR MINDS NOW BECOME SUBJECT TO THE word and let's lay aside the the noise of of time and listen at what the spirit has been saying to us &gt;&gt; because we're facing a new year and we're not stepping into uncertainty. &gt;&gt; We are actually stepping into fulfillment. &gt;&gt; Amen. There are words of promise that God will fulfill in this year to come. And as we reflect ON WHAT GOD HAS SPOKEN throughout this past year, I I just trust he'll give us eyes to see and ears to hear and hearts to believe because what God does cannot be undone. And this past year, as you know, I've been speaking on mountain movers. And no doubt there are mountains still in your life. Each one of you can probably think of mountains, maybe insurmountable mountains that you can't climb that must be moved. And and so so yet we look ahead realizing that we still have a promise. &gt;&gt; Whatever mountain in your way, &gt;&gt; Amen. it before you it shall become a plane. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he is going TO BRING FORTH THE FINISHING STONE, &gt;&gt; the capstone crying grace, grace. &gt;&gt; And and as we began in n and in actually 2025, we we began with speaking on the coming capstone. As Zachchariah said, the capstone is brought forth with shoutings of grace, grace unto it. And we've had a lot to shout about and rejoice about. Amen. But we know that THE CAPSTONE IS NOT JUST A DOCTRINE. It is Christ himself. He is returning to his church as as the head, the the full word restored with his original power, with its original manifestations. &gt;&gt; NOW THE MYSTERIES SEALED TO THE AGES have been opened. And the seven thunders did not add us to us a new gospel, BUT IT KEPT THE RESTORATION. IT PEELED BACK LAYERS OF confusion &gt;&gt; and brought THE TO LIGHT THE word that had been hidden through the ages &gt;&gt; AND BROUGHT IT BACK INTO full manifestation &gt;&gt; so that WE CAN PLAINLY SEE NOW and know EXACTLY WHAT THE APOSTLES PREACHED. SO THAT WE ARE NOW PREACHING THE SAME GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST IS NOT HERE in portion but it is here in fullness &gt;&gt; to bring FORTH THE CAPSTONE. &gt;&gt; A full bride, a people who know their God, a people who do exploits, WHO WILL FULFILL THE SCRIPTURE AND COMPLETE the work that has been promised. NOW OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT NOT ONLY WAS THERE CAPSTONE THAT CAME OF THE MYSTERIES BEING REVEALED WHICH WERE THE SEVEN THUNDERS BUT THE SAME CAPSTONE is also placed upon the individual believer &gt;&gt; NOT AS AN INTELLECTUAL SCENT NOT AS EMOTIONAL EXCITEMENT BUT AS A BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT is the capstone of every believer. It is the head coming to you, the individual, THE LITERAL LIGHT OF JESUS Christ returning into his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Making Christ in you the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we spoke again on the capstone of the ages. AND THAT CAPSTONE OF ALL THE AGES, OF ALL THE CHURCHES, is the living bride. &gt;&gt; GOD WILL HAVE A PEOPLE HERE AT THE END time alive and remain. WHO WILL BE THE MANIFESTATION OF EVERY PROMISED WORD OF GOD THAT SPOKE OF A BRIDE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BEFORE THE PHYSICAL BODILY RETURN OF CHRIST, THERE MUST BE A BRIDE ON EARTH WHO MATCHES HIM. &gt;&gt; The scripture declares that they which are alive and remain shall be caught up together WITH THEM. THE THAT BRIDE IS that living bride. SHE IS A CAPSTONE &gt;&gt; OF THE CHURCH AGES. SHE IS NOT AN ORGANIZATION. SHE IS NOT MAN-MADE. &gt;&gt; BUT SHE is a living word field people. &gt;&gt; She is the living bride. And as a living bride, SHE IS THE VOICE OF THE RESURRECTION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That was again another sermon titled the living bride, the voice of the resurrection. YOU SEE, THE LIVING BRIDE IS NOT SILENT. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T SHUT her up. &gt;&gt; SHE IS [screaming] THE VOICE OF THE RESURRECTION. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE LIVES, SHE LIVES ALSO. &gt;&gt; AND JUST AS JESUS STOOD BEFORE THE TOMB OF LAZARUS AND SPOKE LIFE BECAUSE HE'S A RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE, SO IS THE BRIDE UNDER THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST. SHE WILL SPEAK AGAIN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SHE BECOMES THE FINAL PROPHECY CALLING THE DEAD IN CHRIST TO GATHER THEIR BODIES AND REUNITE WITH THEIR THEOPHIES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE BIBLE SAID THE HOUR IS COMING WHEN THE DEAD SHALL hear the voice of the son of God and they that hear shall live. &gt;&gt; And that voice is in the bride of Christ. Let me just show I just want to bring back for for your attention again three very important quotes that I shared during that time from what is the Holy Ghost or what the Holy Ghost was given for. He said, "The same Holy Spirit that saved THE LUTHERAN, THAT SANCTIFIED the Methodists, that baptized the Pentecostals, IS NOW SETTING IN ORDER THE COMING OF the Lord Jesus WHEN IT'LL BE SO POWERFUL THAT BODY will come into this group of of church and that'll draw the rest of them from the grave. There'll be a resurrection." THAT'S WHAT THE HOLY GHOST IS FOR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE DIDN'T JUST GIVE US THE HOLY GHOST TO PERPETUATE ANOTHER church age, BUT OH NO, THE HOLY GHOST IS GIVEN SO IT'LL DRAW [screaming] THE REST OF THEM FROM THE GRAVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT THERE WILL BE A resurrection &gt;&gt; again. And Elijah, the meal offering, he says that during the days of Luther, we live by justification. During the days of Wesley, we live by sanctification. The church becoming the minority. In the days of Pentecost, we've lived down through the baptism of the Holy Ghost, restorations of the gifts. Now we're really in the minority coming, the coming of the son of God. Here they believed by faith. Here they SHOUTED UNDER SANCTIFICATION. HERE THEY SPOKE IN tongues as a gift. But now the negative and the positive. The cap is coming on the pyramid. And it's the end time when Christ and HIS CHURCH IS SO MUCH ALIKE TILL IT'S GOING TO CALL THE DEAD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. FROM THE METHODIST BY LUTHERAN and all of those BACK THERE. AND THERE WILL BE A RESURRECTION. AND THEM THAT FELL ASLEEP IN the first, second, THIRD, FOURTH, FIFTH, SIXTH, AND SEVENTH WATCH WILL ARISE ONE OF THESE DAYS to meet Jesus in the sky. The hour has arrived, friends. The coming of the Lord is at hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Again, in confirmation of the commission, he says, "Then Jesus IS SO CLOSE TO COMING to earth until now, his power has begun to catch the people and winding them up and getting them ready for the bride, getting them ready to be caught up in the rapture. A church THAT HAVE FIT JUST EXACTLY TO BE TAKEN UP THROUGH ITS POWER WILL DRAW ALL OF THEM, THE REST OF them that's born again out of the earth. Jesus is coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm ready to give voice to that word. Aren't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO, YOU SEE, THEN WE SPOKE ABOUT THEN THE LIVING BRIDE BEING THE FINAL PROPHECY. NOW THE FINAL VOICE IS NOT A new revelation. It's not a new gospel. It's a actually it's a prophetic echo of the original word. &gt;&gt; JUDE SAID THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE DELIVERED TO THE SAINTS. &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE PROPHESIES AGAIN BY believing and manifesting what was spoken at the beginning. I'm glad to declare to you tonight, we don't have a different gospel than what Paul preached. &gt;&gt; We don't have a new message. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that the Bible didn't bring, &gt;&gt; but what we believe can be found right here in the covers of this book. &gt;&gt; It is it is the new covenant. And we are we are recipients of that covenant. And so AGAIN, AS WE SPOKE ABOUT THAT, THEN IF WE ARE THE LIVING BRIDE AND WE ARE THE VOICE AND THE FINAL PROPHECY, THEN WE ARE ADOPTED SONS WHO ARE THE CONQUERORS OF THE AIR FOR WE WILL MEET him in the air. &gt;&gt; Well, YOU KNOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM SHARED WITH US THAT THAT the that the atmospheres between us and God had become dark with demon powers because of sin. AND MY JESUS CAME DOWN THROUGH THAT, BROKE THROUGH THAT, DOWN THROUGH THE POWERS OF DARKNESS, CAME DOWN AND AND GAVE HIS LIFE, ASCENDLED BACK, MADE A WAY FOR US. &gt;&gt; He said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see, as the word comes to fullness, sons move from childhood into adoption, mature placement. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not a child bride he's marrying. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. She is a mature elect lady. &gt;&gt; Paul described this as coming unto a perfect man. Unto how HOW PERFECT UNTO THE MEASURE OF THE STATURE OF THE fullness of Christ. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THESE SONS DO NOT MERELY SURVIVE THE ATMOSPHERE OF the age. They conquer it. &gt;&gt; AND I'M LOOKING AT CONQUERORS TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OVERCOMERS IN THIS AGE THAT WILL CONQUER SIN, CONQUER UNBELIEF, CONQUER THE DARKNESS OF THE AGES, BREAK THROUGH THE LIGHT. AMEN. DISPEL THE DARKNESS, TAKE THE SWORD OF THE WORD AND PRESS THROUGH THE ENEMY. COME ON, CHURCH. WE ARE A PEOPLE WHO ARE CONQUERORS. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT LEAVING OUT OF HERE DEFEATED. WE ARE LEAVING HERE A BRIDE, OVERCOMER, VICTORIOUS. AMEN. WITHOUT SPOT OR WITHOUT A WRINKLE OR WITHOUT A BLEMISH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. People that ascend in faith and authority, they're casting down demonic strongholds, &gt;&gt; overcoming Satan, for they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they love not their lives unto the death. So we are in the adoption age &gt;&gt; and so this being the adoption age &gt;&gt; where full sons are manifested because we have received the full word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Creation itself waits for this unveiling. It has been LONGING FOR THAT TIME. AND HERE WE ARE AT THE CLIMAX AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID WHEN FULL SONS OF GOD ARE MANIFESTED. &gt;&gt; That'll take every power away from THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; WHAT AN AGE. &gt;&gt; WHAT A CALLING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND SO AS ADOPTED SONS, WE ARE ASCENDING. &gt;&gt; I'm using some of my titles now. &gt;&gt; ADOPTED SONS, ASCENDING. WE'RE WE ARE NOT GOING TO DECLINE. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT A PART OF THE FALLEN WORLD. &gt;&gt; WE ARE A PART OF THE PEOPLE THAT ASCEND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AS THESE SONS ASCEND SPIRITUALLY, SATAN AND HIS ANGELS ARE CAST DOWN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, WE'RE ALSO LIVING IN THE CASTING DOWN OF SATAN AS A BRIDE RISES TAKING HER position &gt;&gt; in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is it? They recognize and they operate in their legal rights [snorts] &gt;&gt; that has been given to them by the mighty angel. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; You wasn't handed this by Bible school. &gt;&gt; You wasn't given this to BY THEOLOGIANS. THE MIGHTY ANGEL HAS ANOINTED YOU AND HANDED YOU AN OPEN BOOK THAT WE HAVE ATE AND WE HAVE DIGESTED &gt;&gt; AND NOW IT IS THE TIME TO SPEAK IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. PEOPLE THAT WILL SPEAK TO THEIR MOUNTAINS. &gt;&gt; A PEOPLE THAT WILL SPEAK TO DIFFICULTIES. &gt;&gt; A PEOPLE THAT WILL RISE UP WITH A FAITH LIKE NONE OTHER IN ANY OTHER AGE. A PEOPLE WITH RAPTURING GRACE AND RAPTURING FAITH. &gt;&gt; A people who brings heaven's atmosphere down to earth, &gt;&gt; love, faith, holiness, power, &gt;&gt; and the resurrection &gt;&gt; and rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How are we going to do this? My next title, adopted sons, the power of the blood. &gt;&gt; Their authority isn't self-confidence. It's the blood &gt;&gt; cleansed, justified, redeemed. &gt;&gt; Therefore, we can move mountains by FAITH IN HIS NAME. WHY? BECAUSE WE'RE UNDER THE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; IF MOSES COULD DO IT UNDER THE BLOOD OF BULLS AND GOATS, WHAT ABOUT YOU AND I WHO HAVE COME UNDER THE TOKEN, &gt;&gt; THE VERY BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OPERATING IN POWER AND AUTHORITY OF the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in doing so, we are clearing the channels. &gt;&gt; Clearing the channels between us and God by and making a way to meet him in the air, heaven's atmosphere. &gt;&gt; You see, by the blood, the channels are cleared. There's nothing between the soul and the savior. &gt;&gt; The way has been opened for the bride to ascend. &gt;&gt; Amen. Clearing out unbelief, every demon power that opposes him. Therefore, WE KNOWING THAT TAKE OUR POSITION AS KINGS AND PRIESTS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AGAIN, ADOPTED SONS as kings and priests. We reign AS KINGS. WE RULE ATMOSPHERES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. LISTEN, I KNOW THAT TRAGEDIES HAPPEN. I KNOW THAT TROUBLES COME. But I I I KNOW THAT WE WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFICULTIES. But I'm telling you right now, you were called of God to change the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you are a creator yourself. &gt;&gt; And you can choose the atmosphere that you walk in. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE WORLD IS LIKE. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE THE ATMOSPHERE OF SATAN'S EDEN. You can create an atmosphere around you, YOUR HOME, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR CHURCH. COME ON. AN ATMOSPHERE OF FAITH AND BELIEVE HIM. AN ATMOSPHERE OF POWER, A ATMOSPHERE THAT DEMONS CANNOT TROD IN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Because he hath made us kings and priests. &gt;&gt; It was in us that made us this. &gt;&gt; Our authority is not self-made. &gt;&gt; Our authority comes handed to us by the mighty angel himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know what that brings again? Another one, the atmosphere for rapture. &gt;&gt; You see, their faith creates a rapture atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Their faith climaxes in the GREATEST DIVINE healing movement OF ALL. &gt;&gt; THE CHANGE OF THE BODY. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN YOU CAN STACK UP EVERY MIRACLE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH me now? every miracle that HAPPENED IN THE 40S AND 50S AND AND AND ON DOWN THROUGH THE MINISTRY AND GREAT AND WONDERFUL MIRACLES AND STACK THEM all up and it pales in comparison &gt;&gt; to the miracles that are laying before us. &gt;&gt; Amen. For we shall all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye. &gt;&gt; Missing limbs restored. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. EYEBALLS RESTORED. COME ON, SOMEBODY. THE OLD THE GRAY HAIR drift away and come back and and the the ages 21 years old again. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SICKNESS NO MORE. &gt;&gt; GLORIFIED BODIES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AS THE THEOPHONY COMES TO UNITE WITH THE WITH THE BODY AND GLORIFIES IT. &gt;&gt; OH MY, I'm about ready to step into it. &gt;&gt; Don't you feel like that tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to try on try on my new clothes. &gt;&gt; Let me PUT ON A GLORIFIED BODY. &gt;&gt; Not one that stooped with age. Not one THAT IS GRAY AND NOT ONE THAT HAS HIS ACHES AND PAIN. But one THAT IS ETERNAL IN the heavens, united with that eternity, that thought of God. &gt;&gt; For we shall all be changed &gt;&gt; in a moment, &gt;&gt; in a twinkling of an eye. You talk about a massive divine healing move. &gt;&gt; As I think about, you know, brother Bossworth knew about and exercise mass prayers and there would be mass healings. &gt;&gt; We're about to receive a mass healing. &gt;&gt; Not one or two get healed. &gt;&gt; But every living member of the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. So therefore, we are possessors of the heavenlies, possessing heavenly places in Christ JESUS WITH THE ABILITY TO BRING heaven down to earth. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND OF COURSE, WHAT IS IT? WE ARE THE WE ARE COMPLETING THE HARVEST CYCLE. YOU REMEMBER I I SPOKE ON THE two loaves and how that at Pentecost that it was it was not a sheath waved like this. We get the wrong idea. We think of of a gathering like that. Oh, no. That's not what what it was at Pentecost. It was not a sheath taken like that. It was a sheath that had been taken and now had been refined into flour &gt;&gt; and now had made loaves of bread. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so again we come now to two loaves. You know there at at the first harvest uh there there was two loaves. Jews and Gentiles. &gt;&gt; We come here to the LAST HARVEST AND AND AND LOOK WHAT IT IS. TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE SEALED BY THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; AND AND THE BREAD THIS TIME IS THE TYPE CHANGES. AND AND WE KNOW un unleavened bread is considered holy and righteous and whatever. And many times leaven represents sin, but in this case, IN THIS TYPE, IT DOESN'T REPRESENT SIN and unbelief cuz there ain't no sin and unbelief in this bride. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEOLOGIANS WILL TELL YOU, "OH, THE LOAVES HAVE LEAVEN IN IT BECAUSE WE CAN'T overcome sin." &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT WHY THE LOAVES have leaven in it. THE LEAVEN DOES NOT REPRESENT SIN. IT REPRESENTS THE QUICKENING POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT GIVES THE LIFT. THAT'S WHAT MAKES US THE BREAD. THAT'S WHAT MAKES US THE LOAF. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So we Where does this happen? Again, another sermon title, the climax of the harvest. I'm going right back. The year in and review coming right on in. The seed planted at Pentecost, buried through the dark ages, sprouted in the reformation, now returns to full drain for the harvest. &gt;&gt; But there again, we have we change our focus just a little bit and we speak about the great separation, the two vines, because the wheat and the tear mature together. And the true and false vines both bear fruit, but one is gathered for the garner and the other for the burning. &gt;&gt; And so we are also in a time of separation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now that brings us to Leodysia, the last age being the rapturing age BECAUSE THE BRIDE IS RAPTURED out of the seventh church age. &gt;&gt; Now I'm just telling you friends, this is where we're at. We're in the seventh age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where the bride is raptured, &gt;&gt; called out in this age &gt;&gt; now. And and of course, if we're going TO DO THAT, YOU REMEMBER I I TOOK and I took you all the way from time to ETERNITY &gt;&gt; AND WE STARTED BACK WHERE TIME began and where so when sin entered into the picture and and time has has been and and come through the times of Israel and the old covenant, the times of the Gentiles and and bring it into the new covenant and coming right on down into the seven church ages and all of that and time will continue right on even into the millennium &gt;&gt; which is the seventh day. &gt;&gt; But then it CEASES AFTER THE WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT &gt;&gt; as eternity fully dawn and we go into the eighth day of the new heavens and the new earth. Friends, we have just begun &gt;&gt; discovering the great things of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. But you know when Leodysia also comes the most deceiving age. &gt;&gt; It is the most deceptive age of Matthew 24:24 that and many will miss this hour and enter into tribulation. Multitudes will be will go into that. BUT YOU KNOW FOR US WE HAVE A DIVINE VACCINE &gt;&gt; THAT INOCULATES US &gt;&gt; FROM EVER HAVING TO go through the tribulation. Amen. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AREN'T YOU GLAD FOR THAT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT IS CALLED THE ETERNAL PRESCRIPTION. &gt;&gt; OH YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WHAT WHERE YET GOD RESTORES what was lost. The new birth RETURNS EXACTLY as Peter preached it. Repent and be baptized every one of you. And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; For this promise is to you even you in this last age of Leodysia. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what is he doing? Remember I came back from brother Biscos where I I spoke his service on of the of the arrow of deliverance and and I spoke of how that we must now take the bow in our hands. And I spoke of a sermon CALLED AND I SOUGHT for a man that God IN THIS AGE IN THIS TIME is is birthing men of responsibility. husbands, fathers, LEADERS WHO WILL GIVE THE WORD PREEMINENCE, &gt;&gt; WHO WILL GIVE MAKE THE WORD FIRST IN THEIR LIVES. &gt;&gt; I SPOKE THEN ABOUT HOW WE MUST BREAK THE CYCLE OF REVIVAL AND DEATH. THAT THESE SONS THAT HAVE BEEN CALLED, THESE MEN OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT GOD IS SEEKING FOR HERE, THEY BREAK THE HISTORIC CYCLE OF REVIVAL FOLLOWED BY DEATH. THEY DON'T SETTLE DOWN INTO FORM. They remain in life. &gt;&gt; Remember, we're going to BE THE LIVING BRIDE, ALIVE [screaming] AND REMAIN. &gt;&gt; NOT A DEAD CHURCH. &gt;&gt; COME ON. NOT AN EMOTIONLESS CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOT A POWERLESS CHURCH, &gt;&gt; BUT A LIVING BRIDE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And then and what will we do? We will pull down strongholds. And as we pull down strongholds, we cast down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We stand blameless before him in his sight. Therefore, we we cast down imaginations. &gt;&gt; So now then we begin to speak then about the seal of God and its evidence because the shield is not an emotion. Neither are is it intellectualism. It is Christ living in us. &gt;&gt; It is present truth believed and manifested. &gt;&gt; THEN I SPOKE ABOUT THE THE ANOINTING and the seal. How that the bride MUST HAVE BOTH. SHE MUST HAVE THE ANOINTING to do exploits. &gt;&gt; Amen. But she has TO HAVE THE SEAL FOR eternal pers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTING WILL COME AND GO. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THERE UPON ELIJAH, UPON MOSES, UPON JEREMIAH, UPON AND IT WOULD ASCEND AND IT WOULD COME UPON THEM AND IT WOULD LEAVE. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; The anointing would come upon even false ones like Zechariah or um yeah or the one there at the temple that that prophesied of of his death. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; AMEN. COME UPON ONES LIKE BALUM, LIKE UPON JUDAS. THE ANOINTING WOULD GIVE POWER FOR EXPLOITS. &gt;&gt; BUT THE SEAL, AMEN, SEALS YOU TO THE DAY OF REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR IT ABIDES FOREVER. BUT WE NEED BOTH. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; WE NEED THE ANOINTING TO DO EXPLOITS, &gt;&gt; BUT WE NEED THE SEAL TO KEEP US IN THE HOUR of temptation. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we anointed, sealed, and adopted. &gt;&gt; We've been anointed for service, sealed for eternity, and adopted as sons. &gt;&gt; And that brings us now to the invisible union &gt;&gt; because that's what the Holy Ghost is. By receiving the fullness of the spirit, the bride moves or enters into an invisible marriage covenant. &gt;&gt; Christ in union with the church. &gt;&gt; AND IN DOING SO, HE PRODUCES she produces wordborn children. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AS HIS WIFE, SHE RECEIVES A SEED. SHE BRINGS FORTH WORD-BORN CHILDREN. NOT DENOMINATIONALISM. AMEN. BUT ACTS 2:38 believers &gt;&gt; to quote BROTHER BRANDHAM HE SAID BABBLING SCREAMING YOU KNOW YELLING SHOUTING ACTS 238 YOUNGSTERS TONGUE SPEAKING &gt;&gt; come on HE SAID IT'S THE ONLY TIME THE WORD CAN BRING FORTH THEY LIVE THE SAME LIFE THAT WAS MANIFESTED ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR HE SAID AS THE FATHER HATH SENT ME SO SEND I YOU. HOW DID THE FATHER send him? The father that sent him went in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he said, "I'm going to send you the same way." &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad we're not in this Leodysian age and Satan's Eden alone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the God who sent us &gt;&gt; is in us. &gt;&gt; And I'm looking here tonight upon wordborn children, &gt;&gt; children of the word. &gt;&gt; So what was spoke in 2025 was not just random. It was one continuous revelation. The capstone coming down and a bride rising up. And this is this is the closing of an age. &gt;&gt; And church, we are not we're not just merely just reviewed a year. We have actually stood beneath a capstone. And the SCRIPTURE SAID JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, FOREVER. &gt;&gt; SO WHAT GOD WAS YESTERDAY, &gt;&gt; HE IS still &gt;&gt; tonight. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT HE IS TONIGHT, HE WILL BE WHEN time is no more. &gt;&gt; And the word that we have heard this year was not random. IT WAS NOT SCATTERED. It was progressive. It was with with purpose. It was preparing us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "But let patience have a perfect work, that you may be perfect, an entire &gt;&gt; wanting or lacking nothing." &gt;&gt; And God's truly been patient with us. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; The reason we're here in 2025, as I reflect, you know, I thought as a boy preacher, you know, brother Brandon reaching a milestone himself saying, "You're now with as a minister having 33 years of ministry." And I remember very very much the year I marked that 33rd year. And now, February the 1st, in this year to come, I will have ministered as long as brother Brandham lived, &gt;&gt; 56 years. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you, God has been longsuffering. &gt;&gt; I wanted him to come 56 years ago. Yes, &gt;&gt; I looked and preached that he would come. &gt;&gt; And as I've said, he's come for many. &gt;&gt; There's been many that has laid in front of this pulpit, you know, that we have laid and planted his seeds in the garden. &gt;&gt; He's come for many, &gt;&gt; but one day he's coming for all of us. &gt;&gt; And we stand at a threshold. &gt;&gt; And God has been very patient. bringing us from faith to faith. &gt;&gt; We have waited on some of you. Some of you weren't even born, &gt;&gt; but your names were in the book &gt;&gt; and had to be manifested on the earth &gt;&gt; and you're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One day, the last one will come in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to remember these things as we bring this year to a close. The prophet said in Daniel 12:4, "Seal the book even to the time of the end." But in Revelation 22:10, John is later heard saying, "Seal not the sayings of this prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand." &gt;&gt; We are in the hour of the unsealing. Amen. &gt;&gt; It has been opened. And I want to just say what was once sealed has now been opened. And with that opening comes responsibility. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hear me now. What what we have heard comes with responsibility. And you cannot unhear what you have heard. AND WE CANNOT RETURN TO FORM WHEN LIFE HAS been revealed. &gt;&gt; And we cannot live on yesterday's mana in a day of full grain because Jesus said, "Unto whom much is given, much is required." &gt;&gt; So tonight, God is not just calling us some to some excitement. &gt;&gt; He's calling us to alignment. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just to noise and emotion, but to obedience to line with his word to say, "Oh God, let me measure up. I must flip the capstone &gt;&gt; that is coming down." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If the capstone has come, then every stone beneath it must line up with it. &gt;&gt; And if Christ is the head, then nothing else can rule but him. And if the bride is being made ready, then we must live as those who are expecting him. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you like I did with this church in 1977. When 1977 dawned and of course there was a lot of misunderstanding, a lot of ideas and many had said, "Well, this is the year." Brother Brandham said and of course he we didn't have everything that he said but you know there was a lot of misconceptions that was caused by it and I stood there that year as a young man 1977 and I was like what 20 23 4 I don't know something like that but just as a young pastor standing ing in the church. And as I did, you know, I I told him, I said, "Church, you know, I don't know when he's coming." And yet we we got things that are people expecting and they're saying and and somebody even preach this year, well, if if Jesus doesn't come this year, Brother Bam's a false prophet. AND ALL KINDS of sayings that were went out and many would actually throw away their books and their tapes. &gt;&gt; So, well, it didn't come to pass the way they thought it would. And of course, you know, Brother Brandham said himself, I I don't say, don't go away from here and say, I said he's coming in 77. &gt;&gt; I don't know when he's coming. It could be a hundred years from now. &gt;&gt; I pray not. But nevertheless, as we think about it, as I stood that year, I gave this admonition to you, the church. We don't know when he's coming, &gt;&gt; but we're going to live today &gt;&gt; as if he's coming today. &gt;&gt; That's the way I want you to face the year ahead. So as we leave this place tonight, let us carry more than just a memory. Let's carry revelation. &gt;&gt; Let's carry responsibility and expectation. Walk deeper into the purpose of God and sto stand fast. Hold the word. Stay under the blood. Create the right atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Remain in the spirit. And may the God who began the work finish it &gt;&gt; until our faith becomes sight and time gives way to eternity and the bride is changed to meet the Lord. God bless you. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful words. &gt;&gt; Amen. We ask brother Phil and the choir to come. Let's just sing that song. You're worthy of it all.

Why don't you just put your hands on one another and lay hands on one another? Let's just [music] talk to the Lord as we would close out this last service of 20 25 and move into 2026. Pray for each other as we would go forth as a church. Continue to strive for the spirit of God in our lives. Amen. Father God, we come to you, Lord. Just so thankful for an opportunity, Lord, to be in your house once again in these last few moments of this year moving into another. Lord, as we've heard today, we look back looking at all you've done for us and how much you've been there for us. [music] How many times you healed us and delivered us, set us free, and Lord, knowing that the same God was that was with us yesterday is the same God that'll be with us tomorrow. Lord, we're looking, Father, for more deliverance and healings. And as we heard, Lord, of our pastor speaking, Lord, the greatest divine healing campaign to ever take place is the change of these bodies. And Lord, what a year, Father, for it to come, Lord. We're looking for that. We're in anticipation [music] for it. Ask you to bless each member of this church, Father, that is here, Lord. Lord, that can be a part, Father, God, that you would just be with them in this coming year, Father. May they see more of Jesus in their lives and more of you, Lord, and more of your presence, more of your life living through them in their homes and their families, Father. Lord, tonight we just want to make a prayer, an offering of Lord, a a prayer that you would just go out and get those last loved ones, Lord. And Lord, our our sons and daughters that are out there that the devil snared away, God, tonight, may you just begin to move in supernatural ways and break the yolks off their lives, Lord, and set them free. Oh God, we're just looking for that, Lord. Lord, as these last few come in, Lord, they may come in broken. They may come in scarred, but Lord, I I know as a parable it said, "Go into the highways and the byways. [music] My table's going to be full." &gt;&gt; Lord, we're looking for that, Father. We're looking, Father, for your presence to be more real. And, Lord, more abundant and more powerful than ever before. We invite you into our lives a fresh and a new. Lord, we rededicate our lives a fresh and renew, a new Lord. We just give ourselves to you completely. [music] Surrender, Lord, for your will and for your way, Lord, for the food that's provided. We ask you to bless it. For the nourishment to our body, the strength we get from it, we give it back to you in Jesus [music] name. Amen. God bless you. Amen. We'll let you be dismissed and go to the fellowship hall and enjoy some time of fellowship together. Amen. Let's just go in the joy of the Lord. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music]
