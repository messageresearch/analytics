TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] We read of a man from a far distant land who wrestled with the angel all night. He prayed and he prayed. He stayed and he stayed. She put up a mighty big fight as the angel pou Jacob did say or dawn was a break in that day. My patience you've tested, but I need this blessing. I'm not about I'm not about to quit for 30 long days. Nobody can pray. The message to Daniel was shin. Now you'll be the feast for some hungry beast down in the old lion's d. Oh come the next morning. The king was running crying Daniel friend. How are you? Oh, king live forever. My God has delivered. And I'm not about I'm not about to quit. I'm not about to quit. I'm going to make it. Make it all the way. I'm not about to quit. If I can get to Jesus, he'll carry he'll carry me through. I may stumble down and times feel unworthy and sometimes I just feel unfair. But there's a one thing about it and I'm going to shout it. I'm not about I'm not about to quit. Now this battle I'm in, it seems so hard. At times I feel I surely will fall. For the mountains so high, it depresses my mind. When I think, oh, I think just how tall. For the rivers so wide and the valleys are low, as low as a man can get. Oh, but I will come out with a victory shout. Cuz I'm not about I'm not about to quit. I'm not about to quit. I'm going to make it. Make it all the way. I'm not about to quit. If I can get to Jesus, you'll carry you carry me through. See, I may stumble down and times feel unworthy. And sometimes I just feel un. But there's a one thing about it. And I'm going to shout it. I'm not about I'm not about to quit. I'm not about to quit. I'm going to make it. Make it all the way. I'm not about to quit. If I can get to Jesus, he'll carry he'll carry me through. I may stumble down and times feel unworthy. And sometimes I just feel unbear. But there's a one thing about it. And I'm going to shout it. I'm not about I'm not about to play. There's a one thing about and I'm going to shout it. I'm not about I'm not about to quit. [Applause]
