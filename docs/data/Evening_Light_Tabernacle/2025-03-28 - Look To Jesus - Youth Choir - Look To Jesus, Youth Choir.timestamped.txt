[0:02] [Music]
[0:13] When the steps I take are
[0:18] trustful. It's hard to lean on faith
[0:22] when the doubt
[0:25] grows. When the fear of the unknown
[0:28] won't let me
[0:31] go, I will turn to hope to lead me
[0:37] home. I look to
[0:40] Jesus, he's the only
[0:44] way. I look to Jesus, there's power in
[0:49] his name.
[0:52] And any time I lift my eyes, I see
[0:56] darkness turned a light. Every shadow
[1:00] shows me just how much I need him. I
[1:04] look to
[1:09] Jesus. I look to Jesus.
[1:17] Oh, in the highest highs and the lowest
[1:24] lows. He's the reason why I don't walk
[1:30] alone. My struggles are so real, but he
[1:34] is
[1:36] true. I will trust in him to see me
[1:41] through.
[1:43] I look to
[1:45] Jesus. He's the only
[1:48] way. I look to Jesus. There's power in
[1:53] his power in his name. Any time I lift
[1:58] my eyes, I see darkness turn to light.
[2:02] Every shadow shows me just how much I
[2:06] need him. I look to Jesus.
[2:12] Oh,
[2:14] I look to
[2:18] Jesus.
[2:20] [Music]
[2:22] Oh, when mirales I pray for feel like
[2:27] they're out of reach. I know he's moving
[2:31] mountains, making waves in front of me.
[2:35] He's walked his path before me. I'll
[2:39] follow where he leads me.
[2:44] He sees everything.
[2:47] I look to
[2:49] Jesus. He's the only way. He's the only
[2:53] way. I look to Jesus. There's power in
[2:57] his
[2:59] name. And any time I lift my eyes, I see
[3:04] darkness turn to light. Every shadow
[3:08] shows me just how much I need him. I
[3:12] look to
[3:15] Jesus.
[3:17] Oh, I look to Jesus.
[3:23] [Music]
[3:26] Oh, when mirales are prayed for, feel
[3:31] like they're out of reach. I know he's
[3:35] moving mountains, making ways in front
[3:38] of me. He's walked his path before me.
[3:43] I'll follow where he leads
[3:48] me. He sees everything.
[3:52] I look to
[3:53] Jesus. He's the only way. He's the only
[3:57] way. I look to Jesus. There's power in
[4:02] his name.
[4:05] Any time I lift my eyes, I see darkness
[4:09] turn to light. Every shadow shows me
[4:13] just how much I need him. I look to
[4:18] Jesus.
[4:21] Oh,
[4:23] I look to Jesus.
[4:26] [Music]
[4:29] I look to Jesus.
[4:32] Hallelujah.
[4:34] [Applause]
