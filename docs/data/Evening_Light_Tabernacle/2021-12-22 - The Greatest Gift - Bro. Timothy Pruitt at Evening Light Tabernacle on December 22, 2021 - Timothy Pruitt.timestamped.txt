[43:01] amen
[43:02] i'd like to speak to you tonight on the
[43:04] greatest
[43:05] gift
[43:06] the greatest gift
[43:08] luke chapter 1 and verse 1 for as much
[43:12] as many have taken in hand to set forth
[43:14] an order
[43:15] a declaration of those things which are
[43:18] most surely
[43:19] believed among us
[43:21] even as they delivered them unto us
[43:23] which from the beginning were
[43:25] eyewitnesses
[43:26] and ministers of the word
[43:29] it seemed good to me also having a had
[43:32] perfect understanding of all things from
[43:34] the very first to right unto thee in
[43:37] order most excellent theophilus that
[43:40] thou mightest know
[43:41] this with certainty of those sayings
[43:44] which
[43:45] are therein thou has been instructed
[43:48] there was in the days of herod the king
[43:50] of judea a certain priest named
[43:53] zacharias
[43:55] of the course of abia and his wife was
[43:58] of the daughters
[44:00] of aaron and her name was elizabeth
[44:03] amen we let you be seated
[44:10] and they were both righteous before god
[44:13] walking in all the commandments and
[44:15] ordinances of the lord blameless
[44:18] and they had no child because that
[44:20] elizabeth was barren and they both were
[44:23] now well stricken in years
[44:25] and it came to pass that while he
[44:27] executed the priest's office before god
[44:29] in the order of his course
[44:31] according to the custom of the priest's
[44:33] office
[44:34] his lot was to burn incense when he went
[44:37] into the temple of the lord
[44:39] and the whole multitude of the people
[44:41] were praying without at the time of
[44:43] incense
[44:44] and there appeared unto him an angel of
[44:46] the lord standing on the right side of
[44:48] the altar of incense and when zechariah
[44:51] saw him he was troubled and fear fell
[44:53] upon him
[44:54] but the angel said unto him fear not
[44:57] zacharias for thy prayer is heard and
[44:59] thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son
[45:02] and thou shalt call his name john
[45:05] and thou shalt have joy and gladness and
[45:07] many shall rejoice at his birth for he
[45:10] shall be great in the sight of the lord
[45:12] and shall drink neither wine nor strong
[45:15] drink and he shall be filled with the
[45:17] holy ghost even from his mother's womb
[45:19] and many of the children of israel shall
[45:22] he turn to the lord their god
[45:24] and he shall go before him in the spirit
[45:26] and power of elias to turn the hearts of
[45:29] the fathers to the children and the
[45:31] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[45:34] make ready a people prepared for the
[45:36] lord and zechariah said unto the angel
[45:39] whereby shall i know this for i'm an old
[45:42] man and my wife well stricken in years
[45:45] and the angel answering said unto him i
[45:48] am gabriel that stand in the presence of
[45:50] god and am sent to speak unto thee and
[45:53] to show thee these glad tidings and
[45:55] behold thou shalt be dumb and not able
[45:58] to speak until the day that these things
[46:00] shall be performed because thou
[46:02] believeth not my words which shall be
[46:04] fulfilled in their season and the people
[46:07] waited for zacharias and marveled that
[46:09] he tarried so long in the temple and
[46:12] when he came out he could not speak unto
[46:14] them and they perceived that he had seen
[46:16] a vision in the temple for he beckoned
[46:18] unto them and remained speechless and it
[46:21] came to pass that as soon as the days of
[46:23] his administration were accomplished he
[46:25] departed to his own house
[46:29] and after
[46:30] and after those days his wife elizabeth
[46:33] conceived
[46:35] and hid herself five months saying
[46:37] thus hath the lord dealt with me in the
[46:40] days were in he looked on to take away
[46:42] my approach among men
[46:45] and in the sixth month of the angel
[46:46] gabriel was sent from god
[46:49] unto a city of galilee named nazareth to
[46:51] a virgin a spouse to a man whose name
[46:53] was joseph
[46:55] of the house of david
[46:58] and the virgin's
[46:59] name was mary
[47:00] and the angel came in unto her and said
[47:02] hail thou art highly favored and the
[47:05] lord is with thee blessed art thou among
[47:08] women
[47:09] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[47:12] his saying and cast in her mind what
[47:14] manner of salutation this should be and
[47:16] the angel said unto her fear not mary
[47:18] for thou hast found favor with god and
[47:21] behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[47:23] and bring forth a son and thou shalt
[47:25] call his name jesus
[47:28] and he shall be great and shall be
[47:30] called the son of the highest
[47:32] and the lord god will give unto him the
[47:34] throne of his father david and he shall
[47:36] reign over the house of judah forever
[47:39] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[47:42] then said mary unto the angel how shall
[47:44] this be seeing i know not a man and the
[47:47] angel answered and said unto her the
[47:49] holy ghost shall come unto thee
[47:51] and the power of the highest shall
[47:53] overshadow thee and therefore
[47:55] also that holy thing which shall be born
[47:57] of thee shall be called the son of god
[47:59] and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath
[48:02] also conceived a son in her old age and
[48:05] this is the sixth month with her who was
[48:07] called barren
[48:09] for with god nothing shall be impossible
[48:11] and mary said
[48:12] behold the handmaid of the lord be it
[48:15] unto me according to thy word and the
[48:18] angel departed from her
[48:26] and mary arose in those days and went
[48:28] into the hill country with haste into a
[48:30] city of judah and entered into the house
[48:32] of zacharias and saluted elizabeth
[48:35] and it came to pass that when elizabeth
[48:37] heard the salutation of mary the babe
[48:39] leaped in her womb and elizabeth was
[48:41] filled with the holy ghost
[48:43] and she spake out with a loud voice and
[48:45] said blessed art thou among women and
[48:47] blessed is the fruit of thy womb
[48:49] and whence is this to me that the mother
[48:52] of my lord should come to me
[48:54] for lo as soon as the voice of thy
[48:55] salutation sounded in my ears that they
[48:58] leaped in my womb for joy
[49:00] and blessed is she that believed for
[49:02] there shall be a performance of those
[49:04] things which were told her from the lord
[49:07] and mary said my soul death magnify the
[49:09] lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in god
[49:12] my savior for he hath regarded the
[49:14] lowest state of his handmaiden for
[49:16] behold from henceforth all generations
[49:19] shall call me blessed
[49:20] for he that is mighty hath done to me
[49:22] great things and holy is his name
[49:25] and his mercy is on them that fear him
[49:27] from generation to generation he hath
[49:30] showed strength with his arm he hath
[49:32] scattered the proud in the imagination
[49:34] of their hearts he hath put down the
[49:36] mighty from their seats and exalted them
[49:38] of low degree
[49:40] he hath filled the hungry with good
[49:42] things and the rich he hath sent empty
[49:44] away
[49:46] he hath hope and his servant israel in
[49:48] remembrance of his mercy
[49:50] as he spake to our fathers to abraham
[49:52] and to his seed forever
[49:54] and mary abode with her about three
[49:56] months and returned to her own house
[49:59] now elizabeth's full time came that she
[50:01] should be delivered and she brought
[50:02] forth a son
[50:04] and her neighbors and her cousins heard
[50:06] how the lord had showed great mercy upon
[50:08] her and they rejoiced with her
[50:10] and it came to pass that on the eighth
[50:12] day they came to circumcise the child
[50:14] and they called him zacharias after the
[50:16] name of his father
[50:18] and his mother answered and said not so
[50:20] but he shall be called john
[50:22] and they said unto her there is none of
[50:24] thy kindred that is called by this name
[50:27] and they made signs to his father how he
[50:29] would have him be called
[50:31] and he asked for a writing table and
[50:33] wrote saying his name is john and they
[50:35] marveled all
[50:37] and his mouth was opened immediately and
[50:39] his tongue loosed and he spake and
[50:40] praised god and fear came on all that
[50:43] dwelt round about them and all these
[50:45] sayings were noised abroad throughout
[50:47] all the hill country of judea
[50:49] and all they that heard them laid them
[50:51] up in their hearts saying what manner of
[50:54] child shall this be
[50:56] and the hand of the lord was with him
[51:01] and his father zacharias was filled with
[51:03] the holy ghost and prophesied saying
[51:05] blessed be the lord god of israel for he
[51:07] hath visited and redeemed his people and
[51:10] hath raised up a horn of salvation for
[51:11] us in the house of his servant david as
[51:14] he spake by the mouth of his holy
[51:16] prophets which have been since the world
[51:18] began that we should be saved from our
[51:20] enemies and from the hand of all that
[51:21] hate us to perform the mercy promise to
[51:24] our fathers and remember his holy
[51:25] covenant the oath which he swear to our
[51:28] father abraham that he would grant unto
[51:30] us that we being delivered out of the
[51:31] hand of our enemies might serve him
[51:33] without fear
[51:34] in holiness and righteousness before him
[51:36] all the days of our life
[51:39] and thou child shall be called the
[51:41] prophet of the highest for thou shalt go
[51:43] before the face of the lord to prepare
[51:44] his ways to give knowledge of salvation
[51:47] unto his people by the remission of
[51:49] their sins through the tender mercy of
[51:51] our god whereby the day spring from our
[51:53] high from on high hath visit us
[51:55] to give light to them that sit in
[51:57] darkness and in the shadow of death to
[51:59] guide our feet unto the way of peace and
[52:01] the child grew and wacked strong in
[52:03] spirit and was in the desert till the
[52:05] day of his showing unto israel
[52:08] and it came to pass in those days
[52:11] there went out a decree from caesar
[52:14] augustus that all the world should be
[52:16] taxed
[52:17] and this taxing was first made when
[52:20] cyrenius was governor of syria
[52:23] and all went to be taxed everyone into
[52:26] his own city
[52:27] and joseph also went up from galilee
[52:31] out of the city of nazareth into judea
[52:34] unto the city of david which is called
[52:36] bethlehem because he was of the house
[52:39] and the lineage of david
[52:41] to be taxed with mary his espoused wife
[52:45] being great with child
[52:48] and so it was
[52:49] that while they were there the days were
[52:52] accomplished that she should be
[52:53] delivered
[52:54] and she brought forth her firstborn son
[52:58] wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[53:00] laid him in a manger
[53:01] because there was no room for them in
[53:04] the inn
[53:05] and there were in the same country
[53:08] shepherds abiding in the field
[53:10] keeping watch over their flock by night
[53:12] and lo
[53:14] the angel of the lord came upon them and
[53:16] the glory of the lord shone round about
[53:18] them and they were sore afraid
[53:21] and the angel said unto them fear not
[53:24] for behold
[53:25] i bring you good tidings of great joy
[53:28] which shall be to all people
[53:31] for unto you is born this day in the
[53:33] city of david a savior which is christ
[53:35] the lord
[53:37] and this shall be a sign unto you
[53:39] you shall find the babe wrapped in
[53:41] swaddling clothes lying in a manger
[53:44] and suddenly there was with the angel a
[53:46] multitude of the heavenly host praising
[53:48] god and saying
[53:50] glory to god in the highest and on earth
[53:52] peace
[53:53] good will toward men and it came to pass
[53:57] as the angels were gone away from them
[53:59] into heaven the shepherd said one to
[54:01] another
[54:02] let us now go even unto bethlehem and
[54:05] see this thing which has come to pass
[54:07] which the lord hath made known unto us
[54:10] and they came with haste and found mary
[54:13] and joseph
[54:14] and the babe lying in a manger
[54:16] and when they had seen it they made
[54:18] known abroad the saying which was told
[54:20] them concerning this child
[54:22] and all they that heard it wandered at
[54:24] those things which were told them by the
[54:26] shepherds
[54:32] but mary kept all these things and
[54:34] pondered them in our heart
[54:36] and the shepherds returned glorifying
[54:37] and praising god for all the things that
[54:39] they had heard and seen
[54:41] as as it was told them and when eight
[54:43] days were accomplished for the
[54:45] circumcising of the child
[54:47] his name was called jesus which was so
[54:49] named of the angel before he was
[54:51] conceived in the womb
[54:52] and when the days of her purification
[54:54] according to the law of moses were
[54:56] accomplished they brought him to
[54:57] jerusalem to present him unto the lord
[55:00] as it is written in the law of the lord
[55:01] every male that openeth the womb shall
[55:03] be called holy to the lord and to offer
[55:06] his sacrifice according to that which is
[55:07] said in the law of the lord a pair of
[55:09] turtle doves are two young pigeons
[55:13] and behold there was a man in jerusalem
[55:15] whose name was simeon
[55:17] and the same man was just and devout
[55:20] waiting for the consolation of israel
[55:22] and the holy ghost was upon him and it
[55:24] was revealed unto him by the holy ghost
[55:26] that he should not see death before he
[55:28] seen the lord's christ
[55:30] and he came by the spirit into the
[55:31] temple when the the parents brought this
[55:34] or brought in this brought in jesus
[55:37] child jesus to do him after the custom
[55:39] of the law then took he him in his arms
[55:42] and he blessed god and said now
[55:45] let us thou serve and depart in peace
[55:47] according to thy word
[55:48] for my eyes have seen thy salvation
[55:50] which thou has prepared before the face
[55:52] of all people a light to lighten the
[55:55] gentiles
[55:56] and the glory of the people of israel
[55:58] and joseph and his mother marveled at
[56:00] these things which were spoken of him
[56:02] and simeon blessed them and said unto
[56:04] mary his mother behold
[56:06] this child is set for the fall and
[56:08] arising again of many in israel and for
[56:11] a sign which shall be spoken against
[56:14] yea a sword shall pierce through his own
[56:16] soul also that the thoughts of
[56:19] many hearts may be revealed and there
[56:21] was one anna a prophetess a daughter of
[56:24] feng yale the tribe of asser
[56:27] and
[56:28] she was great she was of great age and
[56:30] had lived with a husband seven years
[56:32] from her virginity and she was a widow
[56:34] in about four score in four years which
[56:36] departed not from the temple but served
[56:38] god with fasting and prayer night and
[56:40] day
[56:41] and she coming in that instant gave
[56:43] thanks likewise unto the lord and spake
[56:45] of him to all that looked for redemption
[56:47] in jerusalem and when they had performed
[56:49] all these things according to the law of
[56:51] the lord they returned to galilee to
[56:52] their own city of nazareth and the child
[56:55] grew and waxed strong in spirit filled
[56:57] with wisdom and the grace of god was
[56:59] upon him
[57:00] amen
[57:02] what a gift to the earth
[57:04] it's more than just a story but it's a
[57:06] reality
[57:08] you know we pause for a moment this time
[57:10] of year to remember there is a reason
[57:13] for this season
[57:15] it's more than just a gift or a tree or
[57:18] a light somewhere but you know obviously
[57:20] you know we understand that today was
[57:23] not the day that he was or this
[57:25] christmas the 25th was not the day that
[57:27] he was born
[57:28] but it was a day a day that should be
[57:30] set aside as we heard sunday
[57:33] to remember
[57:34] when a child was born and this child
[57:37] when it was born would change the world
[57:40] forever
[57:41] amen you know it's amazing that one
[57:43] little child be born in songs after song
[57:46] after song be written after him and
[57:49] and it's amazing you know the time that
[57:50] we live in that in this world that we
[57:52] live in and especially in this season
[57:55] you know it always seems like as evil as
[57:57] this world is around this time it's a
[57:59] little brighter
[58:01] you know people loves a little more and
[58:03] cares more for the fellow man and you
[58:06] know all why because a baby was born
[58:09] and of course it was not just another
[58:11] baby
[58:12] but it was god wrapped in human flesh
[58:15] and love came to earth
[58:18] and not only did that love come to earth
[58:20] it was love it was a love that came
[58:23] looking for me
[58:24] and it came looking for you you know as
[58:26] we would read brother brown would say
[58:28] christ was god's love gift to the world
[58:31] amen how many believes that the greatest
[58:34] gift that god ever could give was his
[58:36] only begotten son that was god's
[58:39] greatest gift and it would say there in
[58:41] john chapter 3 and verse 16 says for god
[58:44] so loved the world that he gave his only
[58:47] begotten son and whosoever believeth in
[58:49] him
[58:50] should not perish but have everlasting
[58:53] life for god sent not his son into the
[58:55] world to condemn the world but that the
[58:57] world through him might be saved and he
[59:00] that believeth on him is not condemned
[59:02] but he that believeth not
[59:04] is condemned already in first john 3 16
[59:07] i thought it was very interesting 3 16
[59:10] and again hereby perceive we the love of
[59:12] god because he laid down his life for us
[59:16] and we ought to lay down our lives for
[59:18] the brethren you know he had the power
[59:20] he was god he had the power that he
[59:22] could have compelled come into the world
[59:24] as a as however he wanted to he could
[59:27] have compelled people to bow down he
[59:29] could have compelled people to believe
[59:31] him by his power he had that kind of
[59:33] power but that's not what he wanted
[59:35] that's not what he chose amen i thought
[59:37] it was very interesting that zacharias
[59:39] would see the angel and and he would
[59:42] you know i see all the things there went
[59:45] on as we read in our scripture but yet
[59:47] he would come to this question and many
[59:49] of it many translations translated like
[59:51] this how do you expect me to believe
[59:54] this
[59:55] this was how what he was asking how do
[59:58] you expect me to believe what you've
[1:00:00] said what what kind of sign
[1:00:03] can i have amen but see god did it
[1:00:06] wasn't just he he didn't want to force
[1:00:08] somebody to believe he wanted somebody
[1:00:10] to have a heart to believe
[1:00:12] and so he could have forced he could
[1:00:14] have made but that's not his way amen he
[1:00:16] could have filled the world with
[1:00:18] lightnings and thunders and chariots
[1:00:20] amen to announce a new king's arrival
[1:00:23] but he didn't he could assemble the
[1:00:25] richest and the greatest and the most
[1:00:27] powerful people upon the earth to
[1:00:29] witness the arrival of a new king amen
[1:00:33] but he didn't
[1:00:34] he could have he could have forced
[1:00:36] himself but he didn't god never wanted
[1:00:38] to force himself on anyone that's just
[1:00:41] not the way he does things
[1:00:43] he could've but he chose a poor girl
[1:00:46] from a poor village to give birth to the
[1:00:49] king of kings
[1:00:51] amen instead of a palace he chose a
[1:00:53] stable amen instead of uh the greatest
[1:00:57] assembly of the powerful he would bring
[1:00:59] the shepherds he would bring the common
[1:01:02] people he would bring the common
[1:01:03] laborers of that day and they were
[1:01:05] chosen to be the first witness of the
[1:01:08] birth of a king when god came to earth
[1:01:11] he came to the least he came to the last
[1:01:14] he came to the lowest and he came to the
[1:01:16] lost
[1:01:17] amen these people witnessed the birth of
[1:01:20] a king who never owned a home he never
[1:01:22] held a political office he never made a
[1:01:25] grab for power it was a simple man from
[1:01:28] a poor mother from a small town but
[1:01:31] still considered a great person of
[1:01:34] interest 2 000 years later
[1:01:37] amen what a paradox this is amen why was
[1:01:40] it not because he forced himself to own
[1:01:43] people to choose him but it was because
[1:01:45] for centuries men and women had been
[1:01:48] seeking after god and they found him in
[1:01:52] this little man or in this baby amen
[1:01:55] what's remarkable is that while they had
[1:01:57] been seeking god god had actually been
[1:02:00] looking for them
[1:02:02] so that's what happened 2000 years ago
[1:02:04] was god came down love came down looking
[1:02:09] for a people
[1:02:11] he came in the form of man and showed
[1:02:14] the whole world what god's word love was
[1:02:17] really like
[1:02:18] amen on that first christmas god's
[1:02:21] perfect gift was love
[1:02:24] now if you want to get aggravated at me
[1:02:25] for calling him the chris first
[1:02:27] christmas gift get aggravated at the
[1:02:29] prophet because that's what he called it
[1:02:31] he says now if you take the love out of
[1:02:34] christmas where will you put it
[1:02:36] what will you do with it what will you
[1:02:38] do with him if you remove what we you do
[1:02:41] with him or with love if we remove it
[1:02:43] from the season what fills people's
[1:02:46] hearts amen usually starts to show up
[1:02:49] everywhere
[1:02:50] amen because what's in your heart that's
[1:02:52] what you do amen so that's why you see
[1:02:54] evergreens that's why you see lights
[1:02:56] that's why you see stars that's why you
[1:02:59] see nativity scenes that's why you see
[1:03:01] because it reminds people of the love
[1:03:04] that came looking for them so long ago
[1:03:09] hallelujah i'm so glad his love came
[1:03:11] looking for a people i'm so glad his
[1:03:14] love came looking for me
[1:03:17] amen aren't you glad about that he could
[1:03:19] have left you out there but love began
[1:03:22] to calm and look after you in the
[1:03:24] darkest of places in the diet and it
[1:03:27] chose the poorest of humanity and and
[1:03:30] the weakest of humanity and it begin to
[1:03:33] move upon that person
[1:03:36] you know we could see it like this
[1:03:38] you know as it must have been a as we
[1:03:41] break into this for a moment
[1:03:43] it must have been a little after dark
[1:03:45] and the sun was going down and the stars
[1:03:48] had no doubt been out for a little while
[1:03:51] the light was gone now for two hours or
[1:03:53] so and
[1:03:54] you can see this little donkey
[1:03:57] placing one little tired foot in front
[1:03:59] of another
[1:04:01] going up the back seat side of a hill
[1:04:03] west of bethlehem
[1:04:06] and he was watching to be very cautious
[1:04:09] of his little hooves where he had placed
[1:04:10] him because he happened to be sitting on
[1:04:13] him with some precious cargo
[1:04:17] and joseph was leading this little
[1:04:18] donkey gently along and
[1:04:21] as this little trio started up the hill
[1:04:23] and been traveling all day coming from
[1:04:24] nazareth
[1:04:26] and here mary was sitting up on this
[1:04:28] donkey expecting to be a mother at any
[1:04:30] time
[1:04:31] way past due maybe
[1:04:34] but all things are for ordained of god
[1:04:38] things all things work together for the
[1:04:40] good that love him
[1:04:42] it was ordained of god that there would
[1:04:44] be a a heartless king on the throne a
[1:04:48] bloodthirsty herod
[1:04:50] amen it was ordained of god god knew
[1:04:52] about it and he put him there for a
[1:04:55] reason and he placed him there in that
[1:04:57] place of power now herod might have
[1:04:59] thought he'd done that but god done that
[1:05:02] amen god knew about the taxes
[1:05:05] he knew about the brutal government that
[1:05:08] had no thoughts or mercy on a poor
[1:05:10] mother or or upon the uh anybody that
[1:05:13] was crippled or anything like that they
[1:05:15] he knew about all that was going on he
[1:05:17] did it for a reason
[1:05:20] and he's bringing this little baby to a
[1:05:22] certain place because it's been
[1:05:24] prophesied that he's going to be born in
[1:05:26] bethlehem
[1:05:28] and god's prophecy works together amen
[1:05:31] he may he allows kings to rise he brings
[1:05:33] them down he brings them up he allows
[1:05:35] governments to come up he brings them
[1:05:37] down whatever what is it what's going on
[1:05:40] god's allowing it to happen for his
[1:05:42] prophecy to be fulfilled
[1:05:45] so we see the time that we live in amen
[1:05:47] god's allowed governments to rise he's
[1:05:49] allowed certain presidents to be on the
[1:05:52] scene he's allowed certain things it's
[1:05:54] because it's working according to his
[1:05:57] prophecy
[1:05:59] amen
[1:06:00] so he commanded that they should come
[1:06:03] amen to this place so called bethlehem
[1:06:06] and you know we can see as they stop
[1:06:08] there for a moment
[1:06:11] on top of the heel and
[1:06:13] kind of to stretch their legs for a
[1:06:14] moment and they take mary he says joseph
[1:06:17] tells mary won't you get off the
[1:06:19] off the mule or the donkey for a minute
[1:06:21] and he eases her off
[1:06:23] he would try to be very careful and
[1:06:25] they're looking out as they just come
[1:06:26] over that last hill and they're looking
[1:06:28] at bethlehem
[1:06:30] and he's looking down there and he sees
[1:06:31] the bustling of the city it's swell to
[1:06:34] many times its size because of all the
[1:06:36] other people coming in
[1:06:38] and they're being you know for the
[1:06:40] taxation
[1:06:41] and the sick and the needy and the
[1:06:43] bedridden and the leopard and the cancer
[1:06:46] and the lame and the blind
[1:06:48] all had to come because of a
[1:06:50] government's order
[1:06:52] and herod had been behind it and he's
[1:06:55] he's placed it to this part and this
[1:06:57] little party stops for a moment to catch
[1:07:00] their breath and he sets mary down on a
[1:07:02] rock
[1:07:04] he said i can see
[1:07:05] joseph pick up her tender tenderly in
[1:07:08] his arms and help her off the mule
[1:07:10] and and he just puts her down and sits
[1:07:12] on a nice comfortable place as he could
[1:07:14] find and they're watching this as people
[1:07:17] are in and out in the streets and and
[1:07:19] the crowd and the torches running the
[1:07:21] yales and and people laying there in the
[1:07:23] yards and the courtyards and outside the
[1:07:25] city gate must have been some sight
[1:07:29] joseph must have said you know mary dear
[1:07:32] just think just beyond as they're
[1:07:34] looking at this camp this picture and
[1:07:36] just beyond right over there was ruth
[1:07:38] the moab moabite gleaned yonder in the
[1:07:41] fields of boaz right over there's where
[1:07:44] david with the slingshot took a line and
[1:07:46] he took a bear and right over there is
[1:07:48] where joshua with his gleaming sword
[1:07:51] that fearless warrior of our people
[1:07:53] divided the lands and and he's just
[1:07:56] explaining all that taking place in that
[1:07:58] area
[1:08:00] and here they are
[1:08:02] he turns around and he looks at her
[1:08:06] and he's looks at her pretty face as
[1:08:08] this turned towards the skies
[1:08:11] and he didn't say anymore because he
[1:08:13] said because in her eyes there was a
[1:08:15] reflection
[1:08:16] and there was a star looking back at him
[1:08:19] through her eyes
[1:08:22] he knew she was looking at something
[1:08:24] and she looks at him and says joseph
[1:08:27] have you noticed that star hanging there
[1:08:30] and it kind of turned into surprises
[1:08:32] that you know i haven't noticed it
[1:08:34] before dear she said well it's been
[1:08:36] following us ever since the sun went
[1:08:39] down
[1:08:41] and i've watched it it must be something
[1:08:43] to it because i have a most wonderful
[1:08:45] feeling
[1:08:46] brother branham interjects right here he
[1:08:48] says you know god does things like that
[1:08:51] for his people
[1:08:54] he shows us a lied or he shows us
[1:08:57] something just so we know he's near
[1:09:02] hallelujah this is what he's done in our
[1:09:04] generation he showed us something
[1:09:08] he's given us a message a great shining
[1:09:11] light
[1:09:12] that is shouting out the king is here
[1:09:17] just so we know he's near and he's on
[1:09:19] the scene and no matter what the world
[1:09:22] has to say our governments has to say
[1:09:25] he's still here and everything will be
[1:09:28] all right
[1:09:31] oh let's just rejoice in this christmas
[1:09:33] season amen the world's looking at
[1:09:35] another barrier and they're looking at
[1:09:37] this and they're looking at that and
[1:09:38] they're watching governments fall off
[1:09:40] the mouth but we know we've seen his
[1:09:42] star
[1:09:45] amen we've seen the message the message
[1:09:47] has been heralded and he's here among us
[1:09:50] and everything's going to be all right
[1:09:54] joseph
[1:09:55] might have said something mary
[1:09:58] like this mayor you know what
[1:10:00] you know it's kind of funny this is very
[1:10:02] it's a paradox mary uh we've been under
[1:10:05] this
[1:10:06] mandate by the roman government but you
[1:10:08] know i've never been so happy in my life
[1:10:13] i don't know
[1:10:14] why just looking at the city again and
[1:10:18] where we roamed as boys and girls and
[1:10:21] back in our teenage and school years
[1:10:25] i mean i got it there's an excitement
[1:10:27] about me there's something that's taking
[1:10:29] place
[1:10:32] you know at that moment way over in the
[1:10:34] east somewhere many mile hundreds of
[1:10:35] miles away
[1:10:37] maybe a thousand miles away some magis
[1:10:41] was already on their road
[1:10:44] they had seen a star
[1:10:46] and they were coming to worship
[1:10:48] god's little gift package he was sending
[1:10:52] to the world
[1:10:53] just a little while from then and the
[1:10:55] whole world was going to receive its
[1:10:58] greatest gift it's ever received
[1:11:02] this little package wrapped up for the
[1:11:05] first christmas practice
[1:11:07] that was ever wrapped in all the world
[1:11:10] god wrapped it up
[1:11:13] god wrapped it up the greatest thing
[1:11:15] that was ever wrapped in human flesh was
[1:11:18] wrapped in a guard wrapped himself
[1:11:21] in a christmas package and sent it down
[1:11:24] to the world
[1:11:26] what a gift
[1:11:28] that god would come in humanity
[1:11:33] and wrap himself
[1:11:39] and to think
[1:11:41] he came in such a way
[1:11:44] a few shepherds saw it
[1:11:46] a few magis
[1:11:49] but the majority of the world refused it
[1:11:54] why couldn't they see it
[1:11:57] why did they turn it down
[1:12:00] why is it they don't want it
[1:12:05] you know
[1:12:06] some people get so caught up as brother
[1:12:08] adam would go through many times and
[1:12:09] talk about the tinsel and the wrapping
[1:12:10] paper and we'll speak a little bit about
[1:12:12] that
[1:12:13] but you know to me
[1:12:17] some people get all caught up and it's
[1:12:18] got to be wrapped up just perfect
[1:12:21] every corner has got to be creased and
[1:12:22] they gotta measure out just exactly
[1:12:24] right
[1:12:26] that's for your ocd people
[1:12:28] that's not for me
[1:12:30] because by the time i get it unwrapped
[1:12:31] it's not gonna look nothing like that
[1:12:34] and tear right into it because i don't
[1:12:35] want the wrapping paper
[1:12:37] i want what's inside
[1:12:40] amen see many times they they would look
[1:12:43] at this wrapping paper and it'd be
[1:12:44] wrapped in a little frame so tall and
[1:12:47] hair down to his shoulders and looked
[1:12:49] like just any ordinary rapping looked
[1:12:52] like it was nothing but inside of it was
[1:12:54] eternal life
[1:12:55] [Applause]
[1:12:57] that's what you want
[1:12:59] amen we that's what we're after we're
[1:13:01] not after what's on the outside and that
[1:13:04] was great and that was wonderful and i'm
[1:13:06] glad it came but what i want is what's
[1:13:08] on the inside
[1:13:13] but here they came in the place it
[1:13:14] wasn't you know because it wasn't handed
[1:13:17] to them in the custom they were used to
[1:13:18] gifts being handed
[1:13:21] you know that's the reason it's rejected
[1:13:23] even tonight is because it's not handed
[1:13:25] to people in the custom they've been
[1:13:27] used to receiving gifts but god wrapped
[1:13:30] his own package and he's got a right to
[1:13:33] do it how he wants to do it
[1:13:36] just like you do if you want to take
[1:13:37] time and make them all just pretty exact
[1:13:40] and right that's great
[1:13:43] that's wonderful
[1:13:44] amen but if somebody wants to just wrap
[1:13:46] it in a walmart sack that's great that's
[1:13:48] wonderful
[1:13:51] it's not important what the wrapping is
[1:13:53] what's important is what's on the inside
[1:13:57] and by the way brother tim talked about
[1:13:58] you know carrying on the tradition of
[1:14:00] brother branham and giving a gift to him
[1:14:02] every year and be all right to start
[1:14:03] that here don't forget
[1:14:05] amen
[1:14:08] [Applause]
[1:14:10] the assistant pastor
[1:14:12] brother neville
[1:14:16] i thought i'd throw that in there right
[1:14:18] quick
[1:14:20] meant to do that at the beginning and
[1:14:21] i'm
[1:14:22] short-circuiting every once in a while
[1:14:23] myself amen but see it was rejected
[1:14:26] because it wasn't given the way they
[1:14:28] expected it
[1:14:30] you know they thought well surely if the
[1:14:32] king of kings is coming he's going to
[1:14:34] have an angel salute red carpet's going
[1:14:36] to come out of heaven it's going to roll
[1:14:38] right down into the high priest right
[1:14:40] there to the inner courts or right into
[1:14:42] the holy of holies and say here i am but
[1:14:45] that wasn't the way he came
[1:14:48] amen
[1:14:49] you know it wasn't the way they expected
[1:14:51] it it came as a as a baby crying in a
[1:14:54] dirty manger
[1:14:59] they was expecting something you know
[1:15:02] different they was expecting chariots
[1:15:03] they they were expecting maybe an angel
[1:15:06] escort or or you know something to
[1:15:08] happen like that but he said i had said
[1:15:11] i'm going to give you a sign a virgin
[1:15:13] shall conceive
[1:15:15] and you shall bear and she shall bear a
[1:15:17] child a son and they shall call his name
[1:15:19] emmanuel that's the sign you shall
[1:15:21] receive that's the gift i'm going to
[1:15:23] give you but it still didn't come the
[1:15:26] way they expected it although it was
[1:15:29] written in prophecy
[1:15:34] another thing that didn't come the way
[1:15:36] they expected because it came by some
[1:15:38] poor people
[1:15:40] mary you know and maybe somehow come up
[1:15:42] with this story she met an angel we know
[1:15:44] what happened
[1:15:47] well i mean they told it they told it to
[1:15:49] jesus later he said you know we're of
[1:15:51] our fight we're not we're basically told
[1:15:53] we're not illegitimate
[1:15:55] we're not born of fornication
[1:15:58] the pharisees to jesus because what was
[1:16:00] it referring back back to his birth
[1:16:04] amen so they was trying to disqualify
[1:16:07] him but they didn't realize what had
[1:16:08] happened they couldn't understand that
[1:16:10] god would come off the paper in the
[1:16:13] flesh
[1:16:16] amen
[1:16:18] see that's the gift he wants he wants to
[1:16:20] put his life in the flesh
[1:16:23] not just be a bunch of paper or a bunch
[1:16:26] of tapes on the wall or a bunch of
[1:16:28] quotes on your computer he wants to put
[1:16:30] the gift in flesh
[1:16:33] that's the greatest gift the greatest
[1:16:35] gift amen is not just a bunch of paper
[1:16:37] this is a wonderful gift but it's not
[1:16:39] the greatest gift
[1:16:41] it's a bunch of words
[1:16:43] if it ain't got the life to back it up
[1:16:45] the greatest gift is the life
[1:16:52] he said you know it's like this he said
[1:16:54] when this great gift
[1:16:55] would come to a church the holy spirit
[1:16:58] it falls on people
[1:17:00] but they don't want to humble themself
[1:17:02] they want the holy spirit with class
[1:17:06] they don't want it the way god sends it
[1:17:08] many people wants to receive the holy
[1:17:10] ghost but they don't want to get it the
[1:17:12] way they want to get it the way they
[1:17:13] want to get it
[1:17:14] he said i'm glad you can't do it that
[1:17:16] way you have to go the way god sends it
[1:17:18] and humble yourself so it wasn't wrapped
[1:17:21] in fine linens it was wrapped in a
[1:17:22] swaddling cloth
[1:17:24] it was wrapped with stuff off the back
[1:17:26] of an ox that would put around their
[1:17:28] necks to keep it from galling their skin
[1:17:31] and the ox would the yoke would lay upon
[1:17:33] it and they're sweaty and it's nasty
[1:17:36] and this is what he wrapped himself in
[1:17:39] amen think of it emmanuel the creator of
[1:17:42] heavens and earth wrapped in rags
[1:17:49] what a super sign
[1:17:52] little jehovah crying like a baby
[1:17:56] god made flesh in a package
[1:17:59] the god who covers all space all time
[1:18:02] before there was ever a world or star or
[1:18:04] molecule wrapped himself in a little
[1:18:07] package and was laid in a manger amen in
[1:18:10] a stable where the manure the cattle is
[1:18:12] sheep and straw and hey and jehovah was
[1:18:15] laying there crying like a baby
[1:18:21] they wanted an angel escort and he came
[1:18:24] wow
[1:18:29] god's greatest gift
[1:18:33] wow
[1:18:38] wow you think the rich would want
[1:18:39] something to do with that
[1:18:42] it would pollute them
[1:18:43] to walk in that stable
[1:18:46] and kneel down and worship that
[1:18:50] they couldn't do it
[1:18:51] brought by a little peasant girl
[1:18:55] considered a fanatic because of her
[1:18:57] story
[1:18:59] by carpenter who probably didn't even
[1:19:02] know how to read and write
[1:19:06] maybe didn't hardly know his abcs
[1:19:09] you'd think that would be something that
[1:19:11] could give
[1:19:12] pleasure to the rich and to the
[1:19:15] high-minded and
[1:19:16] the denominational of their day
[1:19:19] no they turned it down flat
[1:19:22] but not only in that day they do it in
[1:19:24] this day as well
[1:19:26] they want a creed they want a dogma they
[1:19:28] want something wrapped in the tinsel of
[1:19:30] religion but they don't want the life
[1:19:34] they don't want the life that comes with
[1:19:36] it that's the reason why today they
[1:19:37] don't want the gift of god
[1:19:39] the united states they don't want the
[1:19:41] gift of god
[1:19:43] they don't want that life they want a
[1:19:44] santa claus
[1:19:46] they want shiny things they want they
[1:19:48] want real bright colors of this and that
[1:19:50] but they don't truly want the life of
[1:19:52] christ
[1:20:05] he says he was rejected
[1:20:09] on that first christmas
[1:20:11] and he's just as rejected today on this
[1:20:13] christmas
[1:20:16] because it disagrees with what they've
[1:20:19] been taught
[1:20:21] it disagrees with how they think they
[1:20:22] ought to act
[1:20:24] it disagrees
[1:20:26] with everything
[1:20:28] of religion he says no wonder there's no
[1:20:30] room for him in the end
[1:20:32] it wasn't wrap right
[1:20:35] it wasn't wrapped in the classical paper
[1:20:37] it was wrapped as a gift a gift from god
[1:20:40] sent from god a god that they didn't
[1:20:42] know nothing about
[1:20:44] although they claimed they did
[1:20:46] and they claimed they was looking for
[1:20:48] him but he came in a way that they
[1:20:50] thought he was coming a different way
[1:20:52] from what they thought okay he was
[1:20:54] coming not according to the creeds and
[1:20:56] they could not receive god's gift
[1:20:59] because he was wrapped up like a baby
[1:21:02] born in a manger come from poor people
[1:21:05] from a bunch of fanatics and they could
[1:21:07] not receive them and neither will they
[1:21:10] receive it today
[1:21:13] there's no room
[1:21:16] listen to this he said there's no room
[1:21:17] for him
[1:21:19] in the end
[1:21:20] there's no room in our religious circles
[1:21:22] today for a holy ghost meeting
[1:21:26] they don't want it it belittles them in
[1:21:29] the sight of the classes of of their
[1:21:31] people it belittles them to think listen
[1:21:33] to this it belittles them to think that
[1:21:35] they would humble themselves to come
[1:21:37] down to an altar and cry and carry there
[1:21:41] until they're filled with power from on
[1:21:43] high and to rise up with newness of life
[1:21:46] but they don't want to sacrifice for
[1:21:49] that gift
[1:21:51] the greatest gift
[1:21:56] you know it is very important
[1:21:58] you know people think of an altar as a
[1:22:00] place of just repentance or a place you
[1:22:02] know because you're backsliding you need
[1:22:03] to go no it's a altar is a place of
[1:22:05] worship
[1:22:07] it's a place of getting making the
[1:22:09] commitment a communion between you and
[1:22:11] god and talking things out that's why
[1:22:13] you don't look down on a preacher who
[1:22:14] kneels at an altar
[1:22:17] a deacon a trustee a song leader anybody
[1:22:20] old elder an elder a young person amen
[1:22:23] it may not be that they got sins in
[1:22:25] their life they may just want to talk to
[1:22:26] god for a moment
[1:22:29] but listen the key is don't stay there
[1:22:31] till you feel something stay there until
[1:22:33] you got something
[1:22:36] stay there until you know that answer
[1:22:38] has been given to you and you receive
[1:22:41] his gift
[1:22:49] he says why
[1:22:51] why won't they receive this life he said
[1:22:53] because
[1:22:54] they receive the life it'll make women
[1:22:56] let their hair grow out
[1:22:58] it'll make women act like they ought to
[1:22:59] it'll make men throw away their
[1:23:01] cigarettes and their smoking and
[1:23:02] drinking and treat their wives and
[1:23:04] families right but it's too much for
[1:23:07] them
[1:23:07] they hold on to a creed of the church
[1:23:09] instead of receiving god's gift
[1:23:12] god's christmas gift
[1:23:13] the greatest gift
[1:23:15] they rather have a creed than they would
[1:23:17] a gift they'll gift they'd rather have a
[1:23:19] paper than the gift they want a paper
[1:23:22] something that's all tinsel
[1:23:24] a lot of fuss
[1:23:25] a lot of
[1:23:26] but nothing to do about it but the real
[1:23:29] gift that's on the inside they don't
[1:23:31] want it he was wrapped in a dirty cloth
[1:23:33] a swaddling cloth he was wrapped today
[1:23:35] in the same thing what they call holy
[1:23:37] rollers and fanaticism and a bunch of
[1:23:40] heretics it was wrapped in that same
[1:23:42] cloth
[1:23:47] he said but i'm glad so glad
[1:23:50] to raise that cloth off
[1:23:52] and look and see what's laying
[1:23:53] underneath
[1:23:55] eternal life
[1:23:57] god made flesh
[1:23:59] and dwelt among
[1:24:00] us
[1:24:02] brother brandon would tell the story you
[1:24:03] can go read it
[1:24:05] it's a very very interesting story
[1:24:07] brother wayne lawson brought it to my
[1:24:08] attention
[1:24:09] my memory again
[1:24:11] he would it would tell in another
[1:24:13] christmas story and god's gifts find
[1:24:15] their place
[1:24:18] about a man and a woman that was really
[1:24:20] poor and they was living in new york
[1:24:22] city i'm i'm assuming it was during the
[1:24:24] great
[1:24:25] depression
[1:24:27] and they had a little girl and they
[1:24:29] couldn't hardly she wanted a baby doll
[1:24:30] for christmas
[1:24:32] she desired a baby doll
[1:24:34] so the father was doing everything he
[1:24:36] could to get her this baby doll
[1:24:39] and his wife had tuberculosis and in the
[1:24:41] middle of all this she ended up passing
[1:24:43] away
[1:24:44] and he's got this little girl and he's
[1:24:46] still working and trying to trying to
[1:24:48] get some money together scratching
[1:24:50] everything he could to go buy her this
[1:24:51] little baby doll and
[1:24:53] she the little girl catches pneumonia
[1:24:56] and dies
[1:24:58] the boy the man runs to his house and
[1:25:01] his grief and he grabs a little tin
[1:25:03] where he saved up money and he got it
[1:25:04] all out
[1:25:06] he ran into the streets and he began to
[1:25:08] weep and cry and look for a baby doll he
[1:25:10] finally finds one that he could afford a
[1:25:12] little raggedy little nothing seemed
[1:25:14] like but it was something he could buy
[1:25:16] for her even though she was dead he
[1:25:18] still had it in him brother branham said
[1:25:20] he kind of lost his mind so to speak and
[1:25:22] he just he just gets by as a doll he
[1:25:25] carries around with him down to the
[1:25:27] streets trying to give this baby doll to
[1:25:29] his little girl
[1:25:32] come christmas night and the parties are
[1:25:34] going on and things are taking place and
[1:25:36] the lights are flashing and music's
[1:25:38] popping and he's walking down crying
[1:25:41] trying to give this little baby doll to
[1:25:43] his little daughter
[1:25:44] the police stops him and said what are
[1:25:46] you doing said man you need to go home
[1:25:48] where you where you live and he said
[1:25:50] well i live with such and says he said
[1:25:51] you're headed the wrong direction turn
[1:25:53] around and go back before you die in
[1:25:55] this cold and he said i got to get this
[1:25:57] baby doll to my little girl
[1:26:00] and he just turns and he walks away and
[1:26:02] the next morning they find the man in
[1:26:03] the alley
[1:26:05] dead
[1:26:06] that little baby dolls put to his heart
[1:26:10] brother branham picks it up and he says
[1:26:12] you know what
[1:26:13] the man had to die
[1:26:15] to give his love
[1:26:17] his girl that baby doll
[1:26:20] he said i expect he gave it to her in
[1:26:22] another world
[1:26:26] and he begins to talk about he said how
[1:26:28] much christ came down that love gift
[1:26:31] and he wanted to give something to
[1:26:33] somebody he wanted to give healing he
[1:26:35] wanted to give deliverances he wanted to
[1:26:37] fulfill his promise and his word he
[1:26:39] wanted to do all this but how could he
[1:26:41] do it he had to die
[1:26:44] he had to lay himself on a cross and be
[1:26:47] crucified so out of him to his to his
[1:26:50] little girl could come love and peace
[1:26:53] and happiness and joy and healings and
[1:26:56] deliverances he had to die to fulfill
[1:26:59] his promise to you
[1:27:01] that's the greatest gift a man could
[1:27:03] ever give is to lay down his life
[1:27:08] and he did it for you
[1:27:10] and for me
[1:27:15] he had to die fulfill his promises
[1:27:20] listen
[1:27:21] this is the greatest thing a man could
[1:27:23] ever find was jesus christ
[1:27:26] if you ain't found him tonight it's the
[1:27:28] greatest thing you could ever find
[1:27:32] it's greater than the biggest gold
[1:27:33] nugget
[1:27:35] it's because he is
[1:27:36] the biggest gold you could ever find
[1:27:40] it's greater than the biggest diamond
[1:27:42] because he is the biggest diamond you
[1:27:44] could ever hold he's the most expensive
[1:27:46] diamond
[1:27:50] he's the greatest
[1:27:52] carroted diamond that was ever brought
[1:27:54] out of the dust of the earth
[1:27:57] the greatest gold that was ever brought
[1:28:00] out of the dust of the earth
[1:28:02] he's a jewel
[1:28:03] he's a jewel of heaven
[1:28:06] but he had to be crushed
[1:28:08] he had to be beaten
[1:28:10] he had to be whipped
[1:28:11] and the bible would say he was wounded
[1:28:13] for our transgressions
[1:28:15] he was bruised for our iniquities that
[1:28:17] the chastisement of our peace was laid
[1:28:20] upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:28:23] healed
[1:28:25] he had to die so you can receive that
[1:28:27] healing
[1:28:28] did he die
[1:28:30] then receive your healing
[1:28:32] did he die
[1:28:33] then receive your joy did he die then
[1:28:37] receive your deliverance
[1:28:39] did he die then receive your peace
[1:28:44] he did it to give it to you
[1:28:48] he was wounded and bruised and chopped
[1:28:50] and cut
[1:28:51] he was pierced in his side
[1:28:53] blood running out of his back from the
[1:28:55] strips it's the stripes he was beaten
[1:28:57] out his beard was pulled off
[1:28:59] his feet driven with a nail
[1:29:02] but he embraced the cross
[1:29:05] think about this he embraced the cross
[1:29:08] instead of a soft feathered pillow
[1:29:13] instead of a little pink gown
[1:29:16] he wore a swaddling cloth
[1:29:19] do we see
[1:29:21] what depths of love
[1:29:26] writers have tried to write it
[1:29:28] they've tried to express it
[1:29:30] we sing the song if we with ink the
[1:29:32] ocean feel
[1:29:34] and where the skies are parchment made
[1:29:37] every stalk on earth a quill
[1:29:39] and every man ascribed by trade
[1:29:42] to write the love of god above
[1:29:44] would drain the ocean dry
[1:29:46] or could the scroll contain the hole
[1:29:49] though stretched
[1:29:51] from sky to sky
[1:29:53] think of it stalks
[1:29:58] made into quills
[1:29:59] billions of men's
[1:30:01] men scribes
[1:30:03] would write five little letters or four
[1:30:06] little letters l
[1:30:07] o
[1:30:08] v e
[1:30:10] it would drain the ocean dry
[1:30:16] this is the love he has for you tonight
[1:30:22] and the scroll this canvas of the skies
[1:30:25] couldn't contain it all
[1:30:28] the love of god how god unfolded himself
[1:30:30] and became a christmas package
[1:30:32] laid on straw
[1:30:35] the first thing he would pelea's head on
[1:30:38] was a little bit of straw
[1:30:40] and a dirty piece of swaddling cloth
[1:30:43] the last thing
[1:30:45] that would be on his head
[1:30:47] a crown of thorns
[1:30:48] and a dirty rag to wipe his eyes
[1:30:52] and he'd be hit in the head saying if
[1:30:53] you're a prophet tell us who hit you and
[1:30:55] he'd be nailed to a cross love
[1:30:59] love reached out to you
[1:31:02] love reached out to me
[1:31:05] when his own children were crying for
[1:31:07] his blood
[1:31:08] he screamed father forgive them they
[1:31:11] don't even know what they do
[1:31:13] he gave the greatest gift
[1:31:18] himself
[1:31:23] but i know how it is
[1:31:27] even in this christmas season we feel
[1:31:28] really odd
[1:31:30] if somebody gives us a gift and we don't
[1:31:32] have something to give back
[1:31:36] so what can you give back
[1:31:39] you
[1:31:44] he gave you him
[1:31:47] he wants from you you
[1:31:51] that's
[1:31:52] the greatest gift you can give him
[1:31:58] oh you oh i got dedicated my home
[1:32:00] brother timothy my house he he gave me
[1:32:03] and my cars and my job
[1:32:06] god wants you
[1:32:09] he wants us in this christmas season
[1:32:13] he's looking for more human flesh
[1:32:16] listen to this brother as we bring this
[1:32:18] on down
[1:32:20] the random surge we would see jesus he
[1:32:22] said see these little ladies and young
[1:32:24] men just teenaged standing here around
[1:32:26] this altar kneeling down
[1:32:28] in this great reckless time we're living
[1:32:31] in
[1:32:32] what a thing
[1:32:34] to see them come weeping
[1:32:37] you just don't know how that pleases the
[1:32:39] holy spirit
[1:32:41] he said let's bow our heads a moment in
[1:32:43] prayer i said to you that's coming here

[1:33:01] father has given me will come
