[36:28] coming up this year as you know the
[36:31] years always bring changes and things
[36:33] that happens and brother Jeremy and
[36:36] sister Sadie had placed their vows to
[36:40] each other want to be married on June 2
[36:44] 20th this year so they have made that
[36:49] agreement with one another and pledged
[36:52] in an engagement to one to another so we
[36:56] want to just congratulate them this
[36:58] morning and thank the Lord for His
[37:00] goodness
[37:02] raise the Lord and I'm just asking a
[37:08] special request of the Lord just make
[37:10] them a whole family of singers a man the
[37:13] bless the Bride of Christ God bless you
[37:15] amen thank you and may the Holy Spirit
[37:17] be with me
[37:23] and God has been really really good to
[37:26] us and we thank him admired the other
[37:29] day we had and I am this is on spur the
[37:34] moment but if anybody could throw up
[37:35] that picture for me of me and sister
[37:39] Karen and our young people the other day
[37:41] I'll tell you what we are we were so
[37:43] blessed to have a whole wonderful group
[37:46] of young people that the Lord has
[37:49] blessed this church with and I think
[37:52] there was about a 70 72 or more that was
[37:56] in that picture with us with if you miss
[37:58] him three of them were young married
[38:00] couples and we're just thankful to the
[38:03] Lord for His goodness to us I think you
[38:07] know when we started building this
[38:09] church some years ago now and we had in
[38:12] our first groundbreaking on I sang a
[38:14] song you know building up the temple for
[38:16] the Lord and I turn around to all of
[38:18] those young people and said we're
[38:20] building this for you and so you know
[38:23] here we are in this time and being able
[38:25] to enjoy that so that what a what a
[38:28] blessing it is that that we have these
[38:31] young people are coming up with the
[38:33] youth camp have a few cancellations that
[38:35] have been made and so I just say to
[38:38] anybody out there listening if you're
[38:40] not going cancel quickly because there's
[38:43] about 10 or 15 waiting in your place so
[38:47] look at this wonderful group of young
[38:48] people amen dr. Pat secret keeps one of
[38:52] you
[38:57] and of course the youngest was a two on
[39:00] the front row there amen
[39:02] we're headed back to Eternity because
[39:05] that's what we come from I wanted to
[39:07] tell you that we have been in earnest
[39:09] prayer about our planned meetings to
[39:13] Japan and also the Philippines and I
[39:16] have reached the point where that
[39:18] decision has to be made about our travel
[39:21] to both of those countries as you know
[39:24] the coronavirus has always already
[39:26] caused concern and actually hysteria
[39:30] among world governments and preventive
[39:33] actions and overreactions are happening
[39:36] worldwide as they tried to contain the
[39:38] virus and as we speak there have been
[39:41] restriction on travel and detaining of
[39:44] ships and airplanes and and of course
[39:47] the problem is not the virus as much it
[39:49] is the reaction the hysteria the travel
[39:52] restriction of governments due to the to
[39:55] the virus and right now we know that
[39:59] they're not travel restrictions from the
[40:03] United States to the Philippines or
[40:04] Japan but there were others that had
[40:07] planned to come from some of the Far
[40:10] East nations and Nepal India Indonesia
[40:16] at different places that had planned to
[40:18] attend the Japanese meetings that will
[40:20] not be able to attend and already those
[40:24] in India who were planning to come have
[40:27] been told by their governments to expect
[40:30] at least a two-week detainment and
[40:33] quarantine upon their return to India
[40:36] because they have to travel through Hong
[40:37] Kong and I spoke to brother Murphy Wang
[40:42] and he says that nearly all of China is
[40:46] quarantined and travel restrictions are
[40:49] being enforced even local travel to
[40:52] where that believers are reporting they
[40:54] cannot go out of their homes but maybe a
[40:57] couple of times a week to go for
[41:00] supplies and they are checked for fever
[41:04] upon leaving their their homes
[41:07] and I have to report back in and
[41:09] actually get permission to go and come
[41:11] and return to their homes they are also
[41:14] checked when they return and because of
[41:17] this there is this there's tremendous
[41:21] problems with shortage of food supplies
[41:24] as there's nothing left on the shelves
[41:26] meager food supplies are costing just
[41:29] for a couple of days supplies over $300
[41:32] u.s. and the streets are empty with no
[41:35] traffic but just an occasional bicycle
[41:38] and you know meetings of any kind like
[41:42] religious meetings church gatherings
[41:44] there they're prohibited pastors are
[41:47] gathering their churches with video
[41:48] conferencing and and preaching to them
[41:51] that way and but on a positive note
[41:54] while this is going on the message is
[41:57] getting translated in record numbers
[41:59] because no one can do their irregular
[42:01] jobs and so you know that we're getting
[42:05] the message friends are translated and
[42:10] on the hub and record numbers so brother
[42:13] Murphy has plans to and had plans to go
[42:18] into Congo with brother Dee oka to reach
[42:23] out to Chinese migrant workers there but
[42:28] due to the virus and the scare among the
[42:31] government the meetings have been
[42:32] postponed indefinitely because of travel
[42:36] again some travel restrictions and so on
[42:39] brother Murphy brother John Leigh they
[42:42] both have guys this to postpone the
[42:44] meetings for at least six months so
[42:47] taking this advice in consideration also
[42:49] with travel concerns and detainment
[42:52] which is one of our biggest problems in
[42:56] the situation because you know if we
[43:00] would get detained in a third-world
[43:01] country well it could be a very
[43:04] difficult situation right now there is a
[43:07] several cruise ships that are being
[43:09] detained at least one I know they're in
[43:12] Yokohama where that even the believers
[43:16] are reporting back to me that there are
[43:19] people on there with the
[43:20] iris and they're being detained and
[43:23] everybody kept quarantine and and their
[43:26] that they're not even being treated that
[43:28] well so they're just forced to stay on
[43:31] the ship and basically held prisoner
[43:35] under quarantine until they can finally
[43:38] get this past them and released and so
[43:42] you know due to taking all this in
[43:45] considerations with tribal concerns
[43:48] detainment brother wrong situation we're
[43:51] postponing the trip planned to Japan and
[43:54] the Philippines at this time and this is
[43:57] of course in accordance with our goal to
[44:00] minister to as many Eastern and Asian
[44:03] groups from India Burma Korea China
[44:06] Nepal and all of that those believers
[44:09] that we're going to meet us there in
[44:10] Japan and I regret this inconvenience
[44:14] but we're trying to use discretion and
[44:16] operate the best that we can and so we
[44:19] ask for your prayers about this it's not
[44:22] that we're not going we just are gonna
[44:24] have to put it on hold for a little
[44:26] while I think I think it was the Apostle
[44:28] Paul said that he had made a plans to go
[44:31] to a certain place but Satan he said is
[44:34] hindered so you know but we know God's
[44:36] bigger than Satan and we know that in
[44:40] the end all things will work together
[44:41] for the good of those that love God to
[44:44] them that are called according to his
[44:46] purpose amens I would that you would be
[44:49] in prayer with us about this situation
[44:52] also about the Chinese believers there
[44:55] and is there there's got to be a lot of
[44:58] suffering there ISM the economy is set
[45:01] down shut down again livelihoods are
[45:04] threatened the food supply and on and on
[45:09] and on it's a very very dire situation
[45:12] that many of those are finding
[45:14] themselves in at this time and and those
[45:16] are our brothers and sisters over there
[45:18] and so we want to remember them in
[45:21] prayer I you know I personally went
[45:23] there and met many of the ministers had
[45:25] ministers meetings with them in
[45:27] underground churches underground
[45:28] meetings with them in
[45:31] China and so you know I know even there
[45:34] present suffering is greater than the
[45:37] sufferings that I as and the repression
[45:39] that I saw there when I visited that
[45:42] country so I you know we want to keep
[45:45] these in prayer and ask the Lord so to
[45:47] intervene on their behalf and of course
[45:49] stop the plague from from reaching
[45:52] anyone any believer a man as we go forth
[45:57] in Jesus name if you'll stand together
[45:58] with me we'll go to prayer now at this
[46:00] time we're going to remember this I'm
[46:03] holding in my hand today a little little
[46:07] part two two going a little stuffed toy
[46:09] it's a little beanbag really but it's a
[46:11] cloth that we're we're going to be as
[46:15] sister Sharon wrestlers asked us to pray
[46:17] over for her nephew Jett rissler that

[47:53] doctors have said and the enemy is
[47:55] attacked Lord in this family that needs
[47:59] to be united with you Lord we know many
[48:02] times father things like this happens
[48:05] and you use it as an opportunity to
[48:08] bring that person that family to you

[48:17] for this baby it was mine Lord I would
[48:21] certainly clutch it to my heart and
[48:23] prayed the prayer of faith and asked the
[48:27] other believers to do the same so Lord
[48:30] today we just clutch this to our hearts
[48:33] and as Lord you clutch it to yours
[48:36] because you are one who can be touched
[48:40] with the feelings of our infirmities
[48:43] that you'll undertake for this baby Lord
[48:46] we rebuke this cancer and the cause of
[48:49] it and asked Lord now in the name of
[48:53] Jesus you use even this to bring them
[48:56] them to you to know you the Living God
[48:59] and father for the believers there in
[49:02] the Philippines and Japan and
[49:05] Lord I can only imagine the
[49:07] disappointment of hearing that we're not
[49:09] coming as we planned to do but Satan has
[49:13] hindered us and a virus into the world
[49:16] threatens world's economies maybe even
[49:19] the economy of our own Lord thou knowest
[49:21] everything but I had no your God above
[49:25] it all and I ask that you will show
[49:28] yourself to me

[49:32] Chinese believers who are in confinement
[49:34] and quarantine and held captive than

[50:09] Lord as we give all of this into your
[50:11] hands and commit our lives in your hands
[50:13] and you know Lord you even an part of
[50:16] this Hindery Satan has already struck
[50:19] down our brother Ron with something some
[50:22] sickness doctors are fearing cancer all
[50:27] of these things they're they're looking
[50:30] and probing them wondering what to do
[50:33] and have a fix but we realize that
[50:36] salvation is not of man
[50:39] salvation is of the Lord and that no
[50:43] doctor can heal and no medicine they
[50:45] can't give can heal in fact it tears
[50:48] down in destroys because of the
[50:51] knowledge that it contains evil with it
[50:55] Lord we pray for guidance for leadership
[50:59] at this time we pray for healing and
[51:02] deliverance in the name of the Holy
[51:04] Child Jesus for your servant brother Ron
[51:07] even for our brother Aaron that is here
[51:10] there's been suffering things in his
[51:12] body Lord we are grateful Lord for your
[51:15] goodness to us and we're part of that
[51:18] goodness contains a promise that says I
[51:22] am the Lord God that healeth all of that
[51:24] diseases so we take you at your word
[51:27] today that you are the healer and
[51:29] because you are the healer we can expect
[51:32] healing on our behalf because we know
[51:35] that it was it was paid for it Calvary
[51:38] and we receive it now individually every
[51:42] one for ourselves I asked your blessings
[51:44] upon this service today and the needs of
[51:47] your people everywhere those of us
[51:50] mungus Lord or God that are in the
[51:53] hospitals and those among us that are

[52:22] we pray in Jesus name
[52:25] man a man god bless you turn with me to
[52:29] Revelation chapter 5 and verse 1 and we
[52:33] so appreciate all of the wonderful
[52:36] singing worship to the Lord today and
[52:38] asking God's blessings now upon all of
[52:42] the service today in a man I pray that
[52:46] you you have been coming praying as I've
[52:48] requested you to do and and just
[52:51] dedicating yourself and and just getting
[52:55] ready yourself individually so that God
[52:59] can move through your life a man that
[53:02] you can be a tool that God would use in
[53:04] this endtime not necessarily to preach
[53:07] it's as far as the pulpit ministry but
[53:10] in whatever capacity that God would call
[53:14] you in to use you for his glory
[53:16] Revelation chapter 5 verse 1 and I saw
[53:19] in the right hand of him that sat on the
[53:22] throne a book written within and on the
[53:23] backside sealed with seven seals and I
[53:26] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[53:28] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[53:31] book and to loose the seals and no man
[53:35] in heaven nor in earth neither under the
[53:38] earth was able to open the book neither
[53:41] to look thereon and I wept much because
[53:44] no man was found worthy to open to read
[53:47] the book neither to look thereon and one
[53:50] of the elders said unto me weak not
[53:52] behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[53:54] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[53:56] the book and to loose the seven seals
[53:59] thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst
[54:02] of the throne and of the four beasts and
[54:04] the midst of the elders stood a lamb as
[54:06] it had been slain having seven horns and
[54:10] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[54:12] of God sent forth into all the earth and
[54:15] he came and took the book out of the
[54:18] hand of him that sat upon the throne and
[54:21] when he had taken the book the four
[54:23] beasts and the four and twenty elders
[54:25] fell down before the lamb having every
[54:28] one of them harps and golden vials full
[54:30] of odours which are the prayers of the
[54:32] saints and they sung a new song saying
[54:35] thou art worthy to take the book
[54:38] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[54:41] was slain and hast redeemed us to God by
[54:44] the blood and out of out of every
[54:46] kindred and tongue and people and nation
[54:49] and has made us unto our God kings and
[54:53] priests and we shall reign on the earth
[54:56] and then in Daniel chapter 12 I want to
[54:59] read from the verse verse and at that
[55:04] time shall Michael stand up the Great
[55:07] Prince which standeth for the children
[55:09] of thy people and there shall be a time
[55:11] of trouble such as never was since there
[55:14] was a nation even unto that time and at
[55:18] that time thy people shall be delivered
[55:20] every one that shall be found written in
[55:23] the book and many of them that sleep in
[55:26] the dust of the earth shall awake some
[55:28] to everlasting life some to shame and
[55:31] everlasting contempt and they that be
[55:33] wise shall shine as the brightness of
[55:36] the firmament and they that turn many to
[55:38] righteousness as the stars forever and
[55:42] ever amen god bless you can be seated
[55:45] I'm going to be speaking today on our
[55:48] legal rights to the book of redemption
[55:51] and I told you I'm gonna be speaking
[55:54] several services about our legal rights
[55:57] so we're gonna just start here with some
[56:00] endtime events and then work from there
[56:02] into even personally what our rights are
[56:06] as a believer and I'll do this in
[56:08] subsequent services because we won't be
[56:11] able to get everything in one service
[56:14] but as we are we have just read in the
[56:19] context of the scripture we know that
[56:23] the book of Revelation is a symbolic
[56:25] book and of course it is it is called
[56:30] also the Apocalypse which is also known
[56:33] as the unveiling so it was something too
[56:37] that was veiled to be revealed and
[56:40] reserved to the to the endtime and when
[56:44] we really get down to it the book of
[56:46] Revelation has been person
[56:48] until four hour time until there comes
[56:51] an understanding and I believe that
[56:54] we're in the days of the understanding
[56:57] rather than in the days of the veiling
[57:00] so it is now the unveiling as brother
[57:03] Branham would preach the unveiling of
[57:05] God or the mighty God and veiled and so
[57:08] we are in a time where things that was
[57:11] written in symbolic form becomes known
[57:15] to an endtime people and so the Lamb
[57:19] himself is symbolic of Jesus and his
[57:22] redeeming work and here we see the Lamb
[57:26] standing to claim his rights to the book
[57:29] of the redeemed the book of redemption
[57:33] if we would look at the Lamb he's a very
[57:36] odd-looking lamb he he he looks there as
[57:41] with seven horns seven eyes all of these
[57:44] are again symbolic things that were
[57:48] written about the lamb and what he would
[57:51] do in his redeeming work and certainly
[57:55] it because it we know Jesus is not an
[57:59] animal he's not a woolly lamb but this
[58:02] was something symbolic so it's not
[58:05] really somebody with or some creature
[58:07] odd-looking animal with with forked
[58:11] hoods or two hooves that reaches and
[58:14] gets the book out of the hand of him
[58:16] that sat on the throne but it is really
[58:19] symbolic of his redeeming work and what
[58:23] he has been doing through the ages and
[58:26] what he is doing in the end time and so
[58:30] at Calvary we know that Jesus did the
[58:34] purchasing work and he purchased our
[58:38] salvation he purchased our healing he
[58:42] paid it in full and and of course they
[58:46] mean that the book of Acts named the
[58:50] conclusion of the book of Mark tells how
[58:53] that he has sins and sits on the right
[58:55] hand of God and he begins his in
[58:59] seseri work paul will explain in the
[59:03] book of hebrews he will tell how that
[59:06] about the the priesthood of Jesus Christ
[59:09] that is not an Arabic priesthood but it
[59:12] is the priesthood of Melchizedek who who
[59:16] had no father or mother who had no
[59:19] beginning of life or ending of days and
[59:22] it was the eternal one and so he would
[59:25] be made a high priest in the order of
[59:29] Melchizedek and so again um as he as he
[59:35] does this he continues to do his work of
[59:39] intercession and we believe that even
[59:43] today he is still interceding on the
[59:47] behalf of his children and that he will
[59:50] continue to intercede until every child
[59:53] of God is manifested upon the earth and
[59:57] the last name is recognized in the book
[1:00:00] of Redemption and of course um that
[1:00:04] recognition is when God makes known to
[1:00:06] you who you are in Christ and and
[1:00:10] identifies you as a believer now Jesus
[1:00:14] does not have to cease one work to do
[1:00:17] another and I he purchased and that
[1:00:20] purchase works from for the first days
[1:00:23] on down to the last age until every son
[1:00:27] of daughter of his is purchased redeemed
[1:00:31] and ready for the rapture so there there
[1:00:35] is the ongoing purchasing power of his
[1:00:39] blood today that is efficacious - to
[1:00:44] purchase every sinner I remember the day
[1:00:48] that he took me back from the devil and
[1:00:51] he paid for it by the blood at Calvary
[1:00:55] but one day at an altar of a lie a
[1:00:58] ruined life was redeemed a man and Satan
[1:01:04] dinner had to take his hands off of me
[1:01:07] and of course City we here brother
[1:01:09] Branham say something very similar this
[1:01:11] in the future home he said one
[1:01:13] I'm I was his property but not now
[1:01:16] speaking of Satan one time that little
[1:01:19] woman that the well was that he
[1:01:21] reference here was his property but not
[1:01:24] now he came to loosen the grip a bit he
[1:01:28] loosed the grip of sin of Satan upon my
[1:01:32] life of on your life and now we are not
[1:01:36] his how often have you heard me say in
[1:01:39] prayer take your hands off of God's
[1:01:41] property hey man see have faith to claim
[1:01:45] your own that's your rights take your
[1:01:48] hands off of her take your hands off of
[1:01:50] him see faith will do it oh my and I say
[1:01:55] what a promise that remains today that
[1:01:58] we can even say to Satan take your hands
[1:02:01] off of God's property and we have been
[1:02:04] redeemed by the blood Satan has no right
[1:02:07] to us
[1:02:08] he has no right to you he has no right
[1:02:12] to remain in your mind you can cast him
[1:02:14] out at any time hey man he certainly had
[1:02:17] no right to remain in your soul because
[1:02:20] your soul is redeemed and he sealed out
[1:02:22] and can't get back him he has no right
[1:02:26] to come into your body and man it's your
[1:02:29] house and it's been purchased by God and
[1:02:31] your body is the temple of the Holy
[1:02:34] Ghost is for God's dwelling place not
[1:02:37] for Satan to dwell in so we have a right
[1:02:40] to tell the devil get off of God's
[1:02:42] property a man that you have been
[1:02:45] purchased by Christ your the purchase of
[1:02:50] the blood of Jesus the Bible said in
[1:02:53] first Peter 1:19 that you're redeemed
[1:02:56] with the precious blood of Christ as of
[1:02:59] a lamb without blemish and without spot
[1:03:03] amen so we are purchased by the blood
[1:03:07] and that blood still has purchasing
[1:03:10] power
[1:03:11] hey man then there comes that time in
[1:03:14] your life where you are you are back
[1:03:17] from the devil you can remember you can
[1:03:20] point back to a time in your life where
[1:03:24] you were dead in sins and trespasses
[1:03:27] but you were bought from sins grip and
[1:03:30] from that from the from the grip of
[1:03:33] darkness and death and you have been
[1:03:36] redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:03:39] and you no longer belong to any devil
[1:03:42] and man he has no claim on you and you
[1:03:46] have a right now as a son or daughter
[1:03:49] God to anything and everything that
[1:03:52] Jesus paid for in fact the whole book of
[1:03:55] Redemption is yours the whole promise of
[1:03:59] every word the entire inheritance
[1:04:01] belongs to you as a believer you are
[1:04:05] very wealthy and rich you're not
[1:04:10] impoverished you've got so many buses
[1:04:13] lay it right in the word and most of you
[1:04:17] are living below your privileges and
[1:04:20] need to look in there and see what
[1:04:22] belongs to you
[1:04:23] amen now jesus as the lamb will keep on
[1:04:27] purchasing and interceding as long as
[1:04:30] there's one name on the book of life
[1:04:33] that has not been redeemed and this this
[1:04:37] is the purpose of his intercession - to
[1:04:41] make sure and to guarantee that every
[1:04:44] name of the upon the book that was
[1:04:47] written and glory before the
[1:04:49] foundational world is purchased in their
[1:04:52] time and their AIDS in which they live
[1:04:55] this purchase and work would work down
[1:04:58] through the ages it works right now in
[1:05:00] our age it is it is afforded to every
[1:05:04] person today who is still lost in sin a
[1:05:08] man and but finally we are now in the
[1:05:12] hour of not just his purchasing work nor
[1:05:17] just his intercessory work but we are in
[1:05:21] the hour of his claiming work where he
[1:05:25] stands as pictured here in Revelation 5
[1:05:29] taking the book and and of course he
[1:05:33] will do this literally when he calls the
[1:05:37] names of those book those in the book
[1:05:40] into a rapture because you see thee the
[1:05:44] believers are the book just as the lamb
[1:05:48] represents Christ the book represents
[1:05:51] all that is redeemed and so when he
[1:05:54] literally claims the book and that's
[1:05:57] still a future event that he will
[1:06:00] liberate everyone from the power of
[1:06:04] death and when he does we will be
[1:06:07] changed from mortal to immortality and
[1:06:11] man and not only the living will be
[1:06:14] changed but the dead in Christ will rise
[1:06:16] first but today we are in the time of
[1:06:21] his revelation when it is no longer
[1:06:26] symbols but it's now the time of the
[1:06:29] claiming the book to reveal its contents
[1:06:33] and to loose the seven seals and as he
[1:06:36] does he sends the revelations down to
[1:06:40] the seventh angel on earth so that this
[1:06:42] book will be open to the believer a man
[1:06:46] so now again what is this it is the
[1:06:51] opening of the wheel and the testament
[1:06:54] to ever believer so that you can stand
[1:06:57] as the lamb is doing and take the title
[1:07:01] to the book and inherit its promises and
[1:07:05] that's where we're at at this time
[1:07:07] because we must take our inheritance and
[1:07:12] claim what God has provided by
[1:07:16] redemption amen and so the hour is come
[1:07:21] to claim our rights I want to say that
[1:07:25] one more time because of what these
[1:07:27] words to have impact and Malorie has
[1:07:31] come to claim our rights this is where
[1:07:35] we're at we are in the claiming our
[1:07:39] where that a people are rising to claim
[1:07:43] what Christ has done for us are you with
[1:07:47] me now I you know I'm gonna share this
[1:07:50] little quotation and it's in the prayer
[1:07:52] but a brother branham's but I want to
[1:07:54] just kind of bring it down to thee in
[1:07:57] his prayer II said Heavenly Father the
[1:07:59] hour is here on the building's warm but
[1:08:02] it's the time the time has come and I
[1:08:06] remember once our dear Lord when you
[1:08:08] looked up and said father the hour is
[1:08:11] come the hour has come for what Oh glob
[1:08:15] the hour has come now for the people to
[1:08:18] believe hey man can we say that this
[1:08:23] morning the hour has come for the people
[1:08:26] to believe if there's ever going to be a
[1:08:29] believers there's got to be people to
[1:08:32] rise to the occasion Jesus looked ahead
[1:08:37] and he wondered will I find faith on the
[1:08:40] earth he say will I find buildings with
[1:08:44] my name on it or churches who gather in
[1:08:47] my name he said well I find faith this
[1:08:50] is what God is looking for in this day
[1:08:53] someone to believe a man because there's
[1:08:57] got to be someone to believe him in
[1:09:00] order to love him you cannot love him
[1:09:02] and not believe him and you cannot be
[1:09:05] married or United to him as a bride to
[1:09:08] the groom without love and that requires
[1:09:11] faith amen so the hours come to believe
[1:09:17] the hour has come for the falling away
[1:09:20] of the church and can we see that the
[1:09:23] hours come where religion would spread
[1:09:25] around the world without salvation and
[1:09:30] can't we see that even even many message
[1:09:34] churches are affected by that they got
[1:09:36] religion and no salvation for maga
[1:09:40] Bolinas denying the power thereof the
[1:09:43] hours come the hours come for your
[1:09:45] church to
[1:09:45] sighs hey mom
[1:09:49] Dowers come for your raise up out of the
[1:09:52] dust and shake her south and come to
[1:09:55] herself and realize positionally that
[1:09:58] she is the Church of the Living God and
[1:10:01] has rights over every demson blessing
[1:10:04] that you promise to her
[1:10:06] they are hers tonight God the hour has
[1:10:09] come amen
[1:10:11] now granite Lord and the hour has come
[1:10:14] now at this hour to pray for the sick he
[1:10:17] was about to have a prayer line and the
[1:10:19] Almighty God I pray you'll send your
[1:10:21] angel tonight in me go through this
[1:10:23] building he healed so many sick people

[1:10:32] going everywhere and people are
[1:10:35] testifying at the glory of God and let
[1:10:37] them know that the Church of God is
[1:10:40] rising and spreading her wings for that
[1:10:44] great flight that's coming God made men
[1:10:47] move away from them wish and them wish
[1:10:51] and hope tonight until a perfect
[1:10:53] understanding of God's plan and be
[1:10:56] healed amen god move us away from wish
[1:11:00] and hope to faith to what shall we start
[1:11:05] believing to we start expecting a man
[1:11:10] when we hear of calamities coming when
[1:11:13] we hear sickness striking Amen when we
[1:11:17] hear of its backing down or ministry or
[1:11:20] people and everywhere is time for people
[1:11:24] when we look at those chains that we
[1:11:26] change from hope I wish it could be you
[1:11:33] know but to people who say I believe
[1:11:37] that is God's will they see lever
[1:11:39] disease it's God's will that casts out
[1:11:42] ever devil
[1:11:43] it stops wielding for people to stand on
[1:11:46] his word and proclaim it and say it's
[1:11:49] mine it's my inheritance it's my promise
[1:11:53] is for me it's what my children it's for
[1:11:57] my uncie's it's wrong
[1:12:01] I'm waving that in the face of the devil
[1:12:05] because I claim and every bit of it is
[1:12:11] for you is for your children it's for
[1:12:14] them that are far off man it's for the
[1:12:18] loss of the unsaved and it's for the
[1:12:20] pratical to come back home it's for
[1:12:27] healing this for deliverance right down
[1:12:30] to the smallest child we're not to break
[1:12:36] and run we're to stand Michael stood up
[1:12:46] the lamb stood up it's time that you
[1:12:50] stand up it's the devil that's supposed
[1:12:57] to be running read your Bible
[1:13:01] hey man do you see anywhere in the Bible
[1:13:06] that we're instructed to run from the
[1:13:08] devil but I am instructed to submit
[1:13:11] myself to God and to resist the devil
[1:13:13] and he'll run so who's supposed to be
[1:13:20] the one running in this hour
[1:13:22] it ain't us it's a time that we stand
[1:13:26] like we never stood a man and as Martin
[1:13:33] Luther would say in his day when he
[1:13:35] resisted the Roman Catholic Church here
[1:13:37] I stand and I can do none other now you
[1:13:44] see it is it's a devil to be that is
[1:13:49] supposed to be running it's his time to
[1:13:51] run it is his time to scream don't tour
[1:13:55] - don't make us leave I mean it happened
[1:14:00] frequently under brother Browns ministry
[1:14:03] brother Timothy pointed out Wednesday
[1:14:05] night you know he hears the stream going
[1:14:07] from this one to that one a dark shadow
[1:14:10] and his voices that are being heard
[1:14:12] in that other dimension screaming oh you
[1:14:15] know help me help me help me help me to
[1:14:18] keep him
[1:14:19] disbelieving I'll be made to leave
[1:14:22] because the devil is powerless if he
[1:14:26] doesn't have something to work through
[1:14:28] [Applause]
[1:14:30] my man
[1:14:31] so you see he don't want to leave so
[1:14:34] he's going to tried to resist but it's
[1:14:37] up to you to submit yourself to God
[1:14:39] resist the devil so he'll be the one
[1:14:42] reven not the church backing down back
[1:14:48] down is the time to proclaim this word
[1:14:51] harder that we ever have preached
[1:14:54] healing more than we ever have preach
[1:14:57] salvation for the lost Lord that we ever
[1:14:59] have you say Mercy's over that's your
[1:15:02] problem not mine mercy never been over
[1:15:05] for me
[1:15:05] I've never preached mercy over and I
[1:15:08] never will preach mercy over as long as
[1:15:12] I preach it it's gonna be mercy you said
[1:15:18] how do you know that brother Tim because
[1:15:20] the only time I'll ever preach is
[1:15:22] immortal ha ha ha that's the only time
[1:15:26] I'll ever preach this is immortal and
[1:15:27] when I change them immortality mercy
[1:15:29] will be over but until then there's
[1:15:32] gonna be mercy and I'm going to preach
[1:15:36] the mercy I'm gonna preach a god rich in
[1:15:41] mercy hey man
[1:15:44] and I don't know when the seals are open
[1:15:46] to me as they should be to you we're
[1:15:49] gonna preach to be pardon God rich in
[1:15:54] mercy he cares do you care
[1:15:58] convinced and concerned we're going to
[1:16:02] preach a man of a God who who is a God
[1:16:07] of grace a God of mercy who heals who
[1:16:11] delivers who saves and he'll save to the
[1:16:15] uttermost any great friends
[1:16:23] then that there's still hope for your
[1:16:25] loved ones they're still mercy and man
[1:16:30] and even some who won't even make it in
[1:16:32] the rapture that there's still some when
[1:16:34] the Great Tribulation a multitude
[1:16:36] without number
[1:16:37] I'm telling you Wayman this God his ways
[1:16:40] is past night into now I mean he is
[1:16:43] wonderful I'm not willing that any
[1:16:45] should perish I'll do everything I can
[1:16:48] to save that make every provision for
[1:16:53] the tube for the Gentile for all even
[1:16:57] after the plan is carried home 144,000
[1:17:01] sealed over there of the Jewish people
[1:17:03] what is that God's mercy then he don't
[1:17:07] forget anything and he won't forget you
[1:17:10] anyone forget your knee and you won't
[1:17:13] forget your loved one
[1:17:17] and his arm is not too sharp then it
[1:17:20] came save I don't care how far that boy
[1:17:24] that girl has wondered out and said
[1:17:26] let's ever thought get rich right out
[1:17:30] and in a moment's time change the whole
[1:17:34] picture
[1:17:34] [Applause]
[1:17:42] brother branham said what what is the
[1:17:46] church scared about evolved when I have
[1:17:50] always wondered what's the matter with
[1:17:52] the Pentecostal people he said they got
[1:17:56] enough faith to blow up the world hello
[1:18:01] somebody
[1:18:02] I'm man I you know they got enough faith
[1:18:05] for all kinds of healing but they're
[1:18:08] just afraid to use it that's the devil
[1:18:12] if we could break that shadow of
[1:18:14] blackness for the people something's
[1:18:17] going to happen and he said that's my
[1:18:20] purpose here and others wouldn't say
[1:18:22] that's my purpose here to break that
[1:18:26] shadow of blackness let's try to hold
[1:18:30] back God's promises because I got news
[1:18:33] for the devil the Holy Spirit has been
[1:18:35] released by the seventh angel message
[1:18:38] back to the church again with the
[1:18:40] fullness of the pillar of fire are you
[1:18:44] with me
[1:18:44] these are not band two classes of people
[1:18:47] once fundamentalist positionally they
[1:18:50] know where they are by accepting Christ
[1:18:53] positioned in him but they ain't got
[1:18:55] enough faith and I find Pentecostals a
[1:18:58] lot of faith but don't know who they are
[1:18:59] and he said it was like a man got money
[1:19:02] in the bank and can't write a check and
[1:19:04] the other ones they ain't got no money
[1:19:06] in the bank and he can ride the check he
[1:19:09] said if you ever could ever get the two
[1:19:11] together I believe something's coming
[1:19:16] together
[1:19:17] I'm gonna bleep it comes together in
[1:19:20] this message and member we know our
[1:19:23] position and we know how to write a
[1:19:25] check
[1:19:27] hey man he said if I could just get the
[1:19:31] Pentecostal people to realize their sons
[1:19:33] and daughters of God sitting in heavenly
[1:19:36] places right now in Christ Jesus that
[1:19:39] God foreknew before the foundational
[1:19:42] world and has ordained us to preach what
[1:19:44] are you scared about
[1:19:46] there's no matter what it is swing out
[1:19:48] there take God's Word and believe it no
[1:19:52] words this is our to stand he said again
[1:19:56] just reading a few of these he said if
[1:19:58] you can ever get the scare out of the
[1:20:00] church and the devil has done great work
[1:20:05] in putting scarecrows we got scarecrows
[1:20:09] against divine healing and then we got
[1:20:12] scarecrows against the prayer lines we
[1:20:16] got scarecrows against altar calls we
[1:20:20] got scarecrows about the move of God and
[1:20:23] people worshiping and the joy of the
[1:20:25] Lord
[1:20:25] somebody's afraid you're going to be
[1:20:28] fanatical well I was gonna say it's time
[1:20:32] we get fanatical hey man and this time
[1:20:36] we get who get happy about what we have
[1:20:38] and realize when you go to realize of
[1:20:41] what you got then you get happy about it
[1:20:45] it's the people who don't realize what
[1:20:48] they got they got a wheel that has never
[1:20:50] been open to them and I just got a
[1:20:54] problem with people saying today the
[1:20:56] book is unsealed and it's got less power
[1:20:59] in it now than when it had me boy it was
[1:21:01] open if it's open then it's got more
[1:21:05] power more blessings because we know
[1:21:08] more we see what our inheritance is and
[1:21:12] we can claim it as our solid viral
[1:21:15] cause it's been given to us I'm gonna
[1:21:23] take a drink while you get on board
[1:21:29] it ain't wine but I wish it was new wine
[1:21:36] and I hope I'm believing it's gonna get
[1:21:38] poured over this congregation this
[1:21:40] Mormon and I hope there's enough enough
[1:21:46] wine bottles in here that is emptied out
[1:21:49] the world enough that when he pours it
[1:21:53] out a man that you got to fumble up and
[1:21:57] ready to receive it
[1:21:58] [Applause]
[1:22:00] hallelujah he says again he says but
[1:22:04] you're scared you're afraid you don't
[1:22:06] realize your sons and daughters of God
[1:22:08] and now not we will be we are now sons
[1:22:12] and daughters of God not we as in the
[1:22:14] future and we won't be sometime in the
[1:22:16] future sitting in heavenly places but
[1:22:19] now we're sitting in heavenly places
[1:22:20] right now and now we are sons and
[1:22:24] daughters of God and it doesn't appear
[1:22:26] yet what we will be in the end but we
[1:22:28] know we'll see him but we'll have a body
[1:22:30] like his we'll see him as he is but now
[1:22:32] we are sons and daughters of God and the
[1:22:36] covenant is made to Abraham and his seed
[1:22:38] after him
[1:22:40] hallelujah the Covenant is ours so we
[1:22:48] see in our opening scripture Jesus the
[1:22:53] Lamb claim entitled claiming his rights
[1:22:59] John said I beheld and lo in the midst
[1:23:02] of the throne and of the four beasts and
[1:23:05] of the midst of the elders stood a lamb
[1:23:06] as it had been slain that's seven horns
[1:23:12] seven eyes we will find these are the
[1:23:15] seven spirits of God sent forth and all
[1:23:18] the earth these eyes and the seven horns
[1:23:22] let me quote from the prophet of God the
[1:23:25] seven horns means
[1:23:27] 7hs calls a horn means a kingdom so it's
[1:23:33] seven ages was the seven horns and seven
[1:23:35] churches are dispensations of the body
[1:23:38] of believers I just want to say I'm
[1:23:43] represented in the lamb are you
[1:23:47] represented in the lamb we see the
[1:23:50] messengers represented in the lamb seven
[1:23:53] eyes the second horns representing the
[1:23:57] seven churches which are symbolic of
[1:23:59] seven ages so again we are all
[1:24:03] represented and identified in the lamb a
[1:24:09] man so now if the lamb stands he has to
[1:24:18] stand with his seven horns he cannot
[1:24:23] stand and leave his horns on the ground
[1:24:27] horns are part of him is that right
[1:24:30] so devil the so he stands with the seven
[1:24:34] horns which represents seven
[1:24:37] dispensational ages of the church then
[1:24:40] if the lamb stands to take the book and
[1:24:43] loose its seals in the horns moves with
[1:24:48] the lamb to claim title to Adams loss
[1:24:52] inheritance somebody with me now so in
[1:24:57] Daniel 12 when Michael stood up the dead
[1:25:01] that were in the graves to them also
[1:25:05] hallelujah its resurrection and life
[1:25:08] time he says I am the resurrection of
[1:25:12] the life and though you were dead yet
[1:25:15] shall live that and that's more than a
[1:25:17] sermon it's a message our message our
[1:25:22] message today is that he is the
[1:25:25] resurrection and the life brother
[1:25:28] Brandon said that that's a bride coming
[1:25:30] up out of darkness and denominationalism
[1:25:33] was like a resurrection and
[1:25:35] in time in the bride coming of Christ
[1:25:39] and she raises up out of the tombs and
[1:25:42] denominationalism to show and declare
[1:25:46] that I am he that was dead and I am
[1:25:49] alive forevermore and you'll never put
[1:25:52] me back in a tomb of another
[1:25:53] denomination again you'll never sealed
[1:25:57] me away and I'll never go back down them
[1:26:00] to death but I'm alive forevermore and
[1:26:03] this bride will not go down defeated and
[1:26:06] she will not be put away in the grave
[1:26:09] but she let me change that's the entire
[1:26:16] message I am Alive I am not dead for the
[1:26:26] first one out of the graves out of the
[1:26:30] denominationalism we have come back to
[1:26:33] life again the dry bones are living call
[1:26:39] the life by message in the last day now
[1:26:46] you're still dry bones that's your
[1:26:48] problem but if you've got ears to hear
[1:26:53] you're gonna quit being dry bones Daniel
[1:26:59] chapter 12 where we read we see that
[1:27:04] again when Michael stood up the dead
[1:27:07] that were in the gray stood up and it's
[1:27:12] time for the dead listen carefully and
[1:27:18] yet at the same time do more than listen
[1:27:22] because it's really really important
[1:27:25] that you you respond pop properly when
[1:27:28] you hear the word of God and accept it
[1:27:30] for yourself but it's time for the dead
[1:27:34] and the barren wounds too to live from
[1:27:39] the wombs of barren women too to bring
[1:27:42] forth the joy of life and claim the
[1:27:46] James in her book can we say that can we
[1:27:53] say that it applies come on now
[1:27:57] it is time for for the for the for the
[1:28:00] Baroness would the wounds of the baron
[1:28:03] Souls to bring forth the joy of life and
[1:28:07] claimed the name the names of her lost
[1:28:10] sons and daughters and return of every
[1:28:15] prodigal back to the father hallelujah
[1:28:22] amen oh are you see again it is the time
[1:28:26] for the womb of the church to bring
[1:28:29] forth Jesus back to earth and every name
[1:28:33] written in the book to stand of their
[1:28:35] feet changed in a moment and quickly
[1:28:39] another we're in the our bullet you know
[1:28:43] I know the other day I just buried one
[1:28:45] of our loved ones but I would just want
[1:28:47] to say to you
[1:28:48] I still stand on the scripture that 1st
[1:28:51] Thessalonians 4 is not just a funeral
[1:28:54] text a man is a prophecy I want you to
[1:29:03] look at yourself as the interpretation
[1:29:06] of that prophecy that I am the alive and
[1:29:10] remain through the coming of the Lord
[1:29:12] and I have accepted his word and I'm not
[1:29:15] going to hinder the rest of them from
[1:29:17] the grave from coming up again but there
[1:29:20] will be a bride standing on her feet
[1:29:22] without spot without wrinkle without a
[1:29:24] blemish it's time for death to give way
[1:29:36] to victory
[1:29:38] and those wrapped in the grape cloths to
[1:29:41] throw them off we're not to be a dead
[1:29:44] church God has been waiting for us to
[1:29:48] die to the creeds the ideas of man and
[1:29:52] strand and it's our that we must take a
[1:29:55] stand the lamb stood to take the seals
[1:29:59] off the book and has sent us back the
[1:30:02] abstract that every age has had the
[1:30:06] title but this is the age of the
[1:30:07] abstract we're where that or that every
[1:30:12] promise is now made clear to belong to
[1:30:16] you
[1:30:16] I just wanted to share a little
[1:30:19] quotation as we as we look at this point
[1:30:23] and go forward this is a message for
[1:30:26] brother Branham of the great warrior
[1:30:28] Joshua and and so you know as we speak
[1:30:34] about this I want you to think of this
[1:30:37] that's supernaturally now the church
[1:30:41] that's the body of the Lord Jesus he
[1:30:46] says is this shadow as it was of the
[1:30:49] natural physical body of the Lord now
[1:30:53] said the church is his shadow on the
[1:30:57] earth are you with me now so he says if
[1:31:01] healings power visions if the things
[1:31:05] that Christ had in him has gone out of
[1:31:09] his shadow then Christ is paralyzed
[1:31:15] so his natural body sits paralyzed
[1:31:18] because that if his physical body moves
[1:31:21] his shadow will move with it and he says
[1:31:26] if we are in Christ by Holy Ghost
[1:31:29] baptism and by the way of the the body
[1:31:33] of Christ moves it'll move the same way
[1:31:37] on earth for this the church is a shadow
[1:31:42] of his body
[1:31:46] so now so is where we're thinking of
[1:31:49] this I want what just just to stop for a
[1:31:53] moment this emphasize what he's saying
[1:31:55] he says the body of Christ in heaven as
[1:31:59] he moves the church moves on earth so if
[1:32:04] there's no visions
[1:32:05] there's no miracles there's no healing
[1:32:08] then it's obvious in the Christ has to
[1:32:11] be paralyzed in heaven I wonder if this
[1:32:15] is why some of these guys are preaching
[1:32:17] that Christ is laying there
[1:32:19] comatose because they don't have any
[1:32:24] healing miracles are signs in their
[1:32:28] church so obviously to them they have to
[1:32:32] place Christ as comatose but that ain't
[1:32:35] Bible that's some man's excuse they make
[1:32:41] excuses for why God ain't in the church
[1:32:44] by trying to make the high priests
[1:32:46] Christ powerless and render him
[1:32:49] ineffective so therefore that doesn't
[1:32:52] have to be any movement in the church
[1:32:54] and the church sits dead as flem o'clock
[1:32:57] midnight twice dead and puffed up from
[1:33:00] the roots and they have no miracles I
[1:33:03] have no signs that no wonders I have no
[1:33:05] healing there's no towns there's no
[1:33:07] interpretation there's no gifts of the
[1:33:09] Spirit because their christ is a dead
[1:33:11] christ but that's not mine Christ that's
[1:33:17] a Christ of their own homemade theology
[1:33:19] but that's not the Christ of the Bible
[1:33:21] the Bible says he and he can be touched
[1:33:28] he can feel your infirmities he's not a
[1:33:32] comatose God sitting on a throne
[1:33:34] somewhere he's a living God a present
[1:33:37] God my healer cog for saving God
[1:33:41] I'll deliver God your God might be dead
[1:33:51] but my name your God may become Atos on
[1:33:58] a throne somewhere and unable to do
[1:34:01] anything about present situation but my
[1:34:03] name that's the Jesus is hatched out by
[1:34:09] some of these guys that are too smart
[1:34:11] and too big for their own britches but
[1:34:13] that's not a believer
[1:34:15] that's an unbeliever let me finish
[1:34:20] reading the quote now taking it out of
[1:34:23] the things of the world predestinated by
[1:34:26] God call of God elected by God children
[1:34:29] of God saved by God baptized in the body
[1:34:32] of Christ by the Holy Spirit feeling and
[1:34:34] made members of the body this body alive
[1:34:37] we're ready willing my shadow will move
[1:34:40] every time anything of my body moves
[1:34:43] that's true if I move my hand my shadow
[1:34:45] moves all right so Enda and the Holy
[1:34:49] Spirit
[1:34:50] Body of Christ the church will move just
[1:34:54] as Christ moose and if Christ in heaven
[1:34:58] can ever get his spiritual body on earth
[1:35:01] moving as he wants it to move watch for
[1:35:04] things to happen and it's beginning to
[1:35:08] come to life they paralyze it long
[1:35:11] enough but the Holy Spirit is bringing
[1:35:14] life to it and it's beginning to wake up
[1:35:16] and beginning to move because it sees
[1:35:20] its position hallelujah now then let me
[1:35:26] bring it home to you for the purpose of
[1:35:28] our Texas moment in Christ the lamb in
[1:35:32] heaven has stood to take the book and
[1:35:37] claim redemptive rights
[1:35:41] then his saddle the church must move on
[1:35:45] earth doing the same thing we must take
[1:35:50] the book we be by the lamp eyes own
[1:35:54] blood and claim I read them their rights
[1:35:58] that's what he's doing in the heavens
[1:36:00] that's what the prides gotta be doing on
[1:36:03] earth it's time for you to be in the
[1:36:16] heavens and claim your redemptive rights
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:27] and you can't do with a closed book
[1:36:31] so everything that closes and everything
[1:36:34] that seals it away from the believer has
[1:36:37] to be removed every promise in the book
[1:36:41] becomes known to you and it's yours to
[1:36:44] claim hallelujah so if Jesus is claiming
[1:36:48] the book I'm claiming the book with him
[1:36:53] hallelujah it's the mighty crescendo of
[1:36:58] the shout turn with me to Revelation 10
[1:37:06] we'll bring them verse 1 I'm just gonna
[1:37:11] go through this chapter because it
[1:37:14] speaks of anointing this is not this is
[1:37:17] not some 900 foot tall fictitious Jesus
[1:37:20] and all Roberts crafted this is not some
[1:37:26] giant this got his feet on the land and
[1:37:29] on the sea this is symbolic of him
[1:37:34] taking possession and he's got his feet
[1:37:37] on the earth and on the sea the land and
[1:37:40] the sea which represents to which from
[1:37:43] which comes two powers in the end time
[1:37:46] when there's a lot of time we could
[1:37:48] spend on all of these but for the sake
[1:37:51] of preaching today and not trying to
[1:37:53] teach I won't go and
[1:37:54] all of them but in Revelation 10 verse 1
[1:37:57] and I saw another mighty angel now the
[1:38:02] this is what he has done when he says I
[1:38:04] saw another mighty angel
[1:38:06] he had already in Revelation 9 seen the
[1:38:09] mighty apollyon and apollyon was you
[1:38:15] know was um was a spirit that rose up
[1:38:19] that was the king over the bottomless
[1:38:21] pit and then there was the loosing of
[1:38:24] the spirits in the bottomless pit and
[1:38:26] things that was reserved for the end
[1:38:29] time and of course in there I'll tell
[1:38:33] you what give me a revelation 9 verse 1
[1:38:35] and 2 because I'm gonna I guess I'm
[1:38:37] gonna do a little more teaching and
[1:38:39] preaching after all but look at this and
[1:38:41] the fifth angel sounded I saw a star
[1:38:43] fall from heaven to the earth I want you
[1:38:45] to notice this coordinates what
[1:38:47] revelation 12 of the fall of Satan from
[1:38:50] heaven and if you notice it was not a an
[1:38:54] angel descending it was an a and it was
[1:38:58] a star falling all right so he falls
[1:39:02] from a position which he has held over
[1:39:04] man as the Prince of the power of the
[1:39:07] air and he comes down and he has
[1:39:10] permission or the authority to open the
[1:39:12] bottomless pit and that's the age that
[1:39:15] we're living in where that there is
[1:39:19] actually Satan has been given permission
[1:39:22] to bring four demons that were reserved
[1:39:25] in Chains until this time that were been
[1:39:29] reserved and held down the Bible said
[1:39:32] that were held in the river Euphrates
[1:39:34] which is again a symbolic all the
[1:39:38] dividing line between Babylon and the
[1:39:42] promises of God so you see that we're
[1:39:45] held trying to get over into the promise
[1:39:47] but they could not do it and they're
[1:39:50] held captive there to the end time and
[1:39:52] they come down and are loosed and that
[1:39:55] bring their persecution in a physical
[1:39:58] manner against the Jews in a
[1:40:00] supernatural natural manner against the
[1:40:02] bride
[1:40:03] and we're under tremendous persecution
[1:40:07] supernaturally even though it's not so
[1:40:11] much physically in that we're all the
[1:40:13] way to jail and you know you got to get
[1:40:15] your backpack and run and all the other
[1:40:17] stuff because that's not our allotment
[1:40:20] our allotment is a rapture not a
[1:40:24] tribulations he's on the catches out in
[1:40:26] the nick of time
[1:40:27] are you with me Amen so we're we're not
[1:40:30] prophesying you in the tribulation we're
[1:40:33] not even worried about running from thee
[1:40:35] from the Antichrist we are standing now
[1:40:40] brother
[1:40:41] we the lamb is standing not running the
[1:40:46] bride stands are you with me now so he
[1:40:50] opened the bottomless pit to come to
[1:40:52] smoke a blinding delusion out of the pit
[1:40:55] and the Bible tells you in 2nd
[1:40:57] Thessalonians 2 that there will be a
[1:40:59] blinding delusion in the last days
[1:41:02] because that people don't have a love
[1:41:05] for the truth that they're turned over
[1:41:08] to a reprobate mind to do what is
[1:41:11] unseemly sighs you see right here the
[1:41:14] smoke of a great furnace and this smoke
[1:41:17] goes down and it permeates like smoke
[1:41:20] does into every crevice of humanity so
[1:41:25] we see it moving right out whoo I don't
[1:41:31] want to get in politics but who would
[1:41:33] ever thought we'd have a gay man that
[1:41:36] could even be considered as a president
[1:41:39] in the United States whoever would have
[1:41:44] thought we would have a communist
[1:41:46] socialist that could boldly stand up and
[1:41:49] want to lead America into communism who
[1:41:52] could have ever thought it who could
[1:41:57] have thought we would have such liberals
[1:42:00] lined up in our halls of Congress under
[1:42:05] the point there is no discerning of even
[1:42:10] life itself
[1:42:12] and the sacredness of life is not even
[1:42:16] sacred anymore who who would have ever
[1:42:22] thought let me get on the other side who
[1:42:24] would ever thought we'd have a round you
[1:42:26] know a rascal a scallywag in the Panda
[1:42:29] in the presidency that wouldn't it would
[1:42:32] actually have had more gumption about
[1:42:35] him than some of these others who are
[1:42:36] boldface a blatant open sinners who
[1:42:43] would ever thought that but we're seeing
[1:42:45] America changes from revelation 13 where
[1:42:50] she is prophesied in Revelation 13
[1:42:52] there's 13 stars 13 stripes well you
[1:42:56] know it she's a woman and this based on
[1:42:58] the number thirteen found in the
[1:43:00] thirteenth chapter of Revelation and she
[1:43:04] raises up like a lamb but then begins to
[1:43:07] speak like the dragon since she starts
[1:43:11] off in freedom of religion and she winds
[1:43:13] up over here as a dragon speaking like
[1:43:18] the devil and I because of death hell
[1:43:24] than ever my imaginable sin she opens a
[1:43:29] bottomless pit and the roses smoke out
[1:43:32] of the pit and the Sun now over here in
[1:43:37] the Revelation 10 his face says it were
[1:43:39] the sun shining and here the sun the
[1:43:43] word is locked out by these and they are
[1:43:48] in delusion and the air that's your
[1:43:51] atmosphere is darkened by reason of the
[1:43:54] smoke of the pit and under the cover of
[1:43:58] all of this every kind of demon spirit
[1:44:00] raises up millions of them out of the
[1:44:04] bottomless pit now the Bible gives him a
[1:44:06] number of thousands of thousands but it
[1:44:09] really is in the Greek its innumerable
[1:44:11] and in so many we couldn't count them
[1:44:14] all so we just give them a big number
[1:44:17] and then and there's so many of them and
[1:44:21] here they are permeating the people of
[1:44:24] the earth
[1:44:26] so now you know Paul I mean John now is
[1:44:30] is looking at all this his name is
[1:44:33] apollyon and he's a for you boys
[1:44:36] his name is also a baton he's a baton
[1:44:44] you get that you got and there there he
[1:44:54] rises up and he's a leader of this
[1:44:57] rebellion that we're seeing around the
[1:45:00] world and it comes down into every facet
[1:45:05] of life and it touches every race it
[1:45:12] touches every home it touches all people
[1:45:16] and it's a blinding delusion a mom and
[1:45:22] so the word is and the atmosphere is
[1:45:25] darkened by the reason of the smoke of
[1:45:28] the pit so now here he says I see this
[1:45:33] happening in the earth
[1:45:35] I see more unbelief rising than ever
[1:45:38] I've seen cédric's a height that is
[1:45:41] never before somebody with me
[1:45:44] it gets described in the book of
[1:45:46] Revelation that her smoke of a you know
[1:45:49] a riot of her sins rather rises up
[1:45:52] before the throne of God and then I want
[1:45:57] you to notice in Revelation 10 1 and
[1:45:59] then he is he's reflected he says nearly
[1:46:03] he concludes in Revelation 9 the worship
[1:46:06] of every kind of of God an evil thing
[1:46:09] and you can imagine the confusion and so
[1:46:11] but look after that look he said but I
[1:46:14] want you to see something different I
[1:46:17] want you to see that Satan hasn't won
[1:46:22] I want you to see that there's somebody
[1:46:26] else in the equation and I saw from
[1:46:41] aliens look away from Abadan yep away
[1:46:45] from the spirit saw another mighty angel
[1:46:56] hallelujah clover the cloud a rainbow in
[1:46:59] his head his face always in the
[1:47:02] brilliance of the Sun his countenance is
[1:47:05] all open it's not a closed but his love
[1:47:09] his face his word is shining in his
[1:47:14] power and his feet Oh his body has got
[1:47:21] the Holy Ghost they are s pillars of
[1:47:25] fire and he takes him places his feet on
[1:47:28] the earth and the sea and he holds down
[1:47:33] the power of those that enemy and he's
[1:47:36] got in his right hand to power a little
[1:47:39] book and it's not closed it's open
[1:47:46] there is an anointing that has come down
[1:47:51] hallelujah I can preach right now the
[1:47:56] mighty angels that we're under there you
[1:48:03] know Moses tried to me Pharaoh without
[1:48:05] the anointing but once he got in the
[1:48:08] midst of the pillar of fire a man he was
[1:48:10] a different man he comes now anointed
[1:48:14] with the mighty angel
[1:48:16] hallelujah under that annoying - he
[1:48:19] defeats Egypt he speaks the word he
[1:48:22] opens up read sees every hindrance has
[1:48:25] to go because he's under an anointing I
[1:48:29] tried to tell you this morning you are
[1:48:32] anointed from a tree you are 19 for our
[1:48:36] you are going to overcome you are 19 to
[1:48:40] put your black oh the devil has limit
[1:48:43] even underneath that devil
[1:48:46] hallelujah I have preached it to the
[1:48:48] anointing of the Lord this morning but
[1:48:51] people who know their God and shall do
[1:48:54] exploits of people who are not yet born
[1:48:57] in time prophecy
[1:49:11] and he had in his hand a little book
[1:49:14] open I want you to know every believer
[1:49:17] has that book in his hand and I'm gonna
[1:49:20] show you in the scripture and he had in
[1:49:24] his hand verse 3 says and he cried with
[1:49:29] a loud voice now this word cried means
[1:49:32] he shouted with a loud voice as when
[1:49:38] ailed rollo a lion roar so you see it is
[1:49:44] a shout this is the endtime prophecy the
[1:49:47] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:49:49] with a shout his coming is in three
[1:49:51] different phases you say his cummins in
[1:49:54] a moment twinkling of an eye no no
[1:49:56] that's the change of the body in a
[1:49:57] moment twinkling of ah his coming is in
[1:50:00] stages he will come as the word come
[1:50:06] into a prophet he will come from the
[1:50:09] word - the word being made flesh and
[1:50:12] then he will come as the groom to take
[1:50:15] away that word that bride that book into
[1:50:18] the heavens now so you see the rapture
[1:50:24] is is that exactly like the verse coming
[1:50:27] the first coming started with a prophet
[1:50:30] a restorer right a man a prophet who
[1:50:34] began to announce the the coming of the
[1:50:38] Messiah the endtime prophecy happens the
[1:50:41] same way
[1:50:42] behold I'll send you Elijah the Prophet
[1:50:45] before the coming of the Great and
[1:50:46] dreadful day of the Lord so before I
[1:50:48] burn it I'm gonna send the lives of the
[1:50:50] Prophet his purpose will be to turn
[1:50:53] hearts back to the faith of the father's
[1:50:55] this will be his purpose John would have
[1:50:59] that similar purpose when he would come
[1:51:01] forth and he would he would prepare the
[1:51:05] heart of the father's there to receive
[1:51:07] the children and this way that God does
[1:51:10] exactly the opposite he prepares the
[1:51:12] hearts of the children to receive the
[1:51:15] message of the Apostolic fathers so we
[1:51:18] return back to the original truth in the
[1:51:21] last days
[1:51:22] how many's with me now so now so he
[1:51:25] shouts as a lion worth you know because
[1:51:30] the lion roars everything else has to
[1:51:32] shut up because he is the final say now
[1:51:37] when this mystery is given to a prophet
[1:51:39] I want you to notice it also is comes in
[1:51:44] in a way look in Revelation 10 7 now
[1:51:48] this shows what we have read shows when
[1:51:52] he takes the book he cries with the loud
[1:51:55] voice as the lion roars and in verse 7
[1:51:58] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:52:01] seventh angel so now we see the seventh
[1:52:04] angel has got to have a voice there's
[1:52:07] got to be a message come when he said
[1:52:11] began to sound the mystery of God should
[1:52:15] be finished as he had declared to his
[1:52:17] servants the prophets so every age has
[1:52:20] looked for this day and so this when
[1:52:23] this mystery is given to a prophet the
[1:52:26] seventh angel then he sounds it's like
[1:52:29] the blasts of a trumpet and he shouts
[1:52:32] out his message finishing the mysteries
[1:52:35] of God amen
[1:52:37] now again verse eight now notice now so
[1:52:42] now we have moved as we go we've had the
[1:52:45] shout of the mighty angel we have the
[1:52:48] voice of the seventh angel now look in
[1:52:52] Revelation 10 a and the voice which I
[1:52:55] heard from heaven speaking to me again
[1:52:56] and said go and take the little book
[1:52:59] which is open in the hand of the angel
[1:53:02] which standeth along the sea and upon
[1:53:04] the earth and I went up to the angel and
[1:53:06] said unto him give me the little book
[1:53:08] and he said take it eat it up and it
[1:53:12] shall make that belly bitter but it
[1:53:14] shall be in that mouth sweet as honey
[1:53:16] and as I took I took the little book out
[1:53:20] of the hand of the angel or the Angels
[1:53:22] hand and ate it up and it was in my
[1:53:25] mouth as honey and as soon as I had
[1:53:28] eaten it my belly was bitter and he
[1:53:31] thou must prophesy again before many
[1:53:36] peoples and nations and tongues and
[1:53:39] kings so when John takes the book now
[1:53:45] again we're looking at something
[1:53:47] what's your symbols because John is
[1:53:51] representing the reading now remember he
[1:53:56] does this in Revelation chapter four
[1:53:58] verse one that John he is caught up at
[1:54:03] the end of the ages
[1:54:04] after Laodicean concludes and he is
[1:54:07] caught up a door is open unto heaven and
[1:54:10] he hears a trumpet talking to him says
[1:54:13] come up hither and john says immediately
[1:54:16] that i was in the spirit and behold a
[1:54:19] throne was said in the heavens so you
[1:54:21] can see in all is a type it concludes
[1:54:25] when the Laodicean age finishes and
[1:54:28] concludes it will conclude with a
[1:54:31] rapture and it hadn't happened yet we
[1:54:35] may be in processes other than we are
[1:54:37] but it hasn't happened yet
[1:54:40] are you with me Amen but John here
[1:54:44] represents here symbolic of the
[1:54:47] believers it's not just him he's
[1:54:52] representing us all so now he changed
[1:54:58] the book and he digest the book and he
[1:55:02] symbolizing the Bride of Christ when we
[1:55:05] take the book then we to shout amen we
[1:55:11] there's a message we're prophesy again
[1:55:14] before many peoples and nations and
[1:55:18] tongues and kings
[1:55:20] now the tendency now listen to me real
[1:55:24] carefully the tendency are the message
[1:55:27] believers has just simply been to take
[1:55:30] revelation ten seven out of Revelation
[1:55:34] 10 the chapter ten as though it was
[1:55:37] separate from the other parts of that
[1:55:39] scripture revelation 10 7 let's look at
[1:55:42] it this is not a stand
[1:55:44] long verse this is a part of a process
[1:55:49] of happenings it is not all that God's
[1:55:53] doing in the end time sitting in a
[1:55:56] profit
[1:55:58] it is only part of what God's doing in
[1:56:02] the end time though it's an important
[1:56:04] part will not under emphasize that but
[1:56:08] the tendency of believers has been to
[1:56:10] take this scripture just as out of
[1:56:13] chapter 10 is do it worth separate from
[1:56:17] the other parts of that scripture but
[1:56:19] it's not a standalone verse revelation
[1:56:21] 10 7 focuses on this sounding of the
[1:56:26] voice of the seventh angel and the
[1:56:28] finishing of the mysteries but as I said
[1:56:31] sin and a prophet was only part of what
[1:56:35] God is doing in the end time now you
[1:56:38] cannot have revelation 10 7 happening in
[1:56:42] this age without also have a revelation
[1:56:46] 10 1 as the mighty the sending of the
[1:56:49] mighty angel anointing coming down with
[1:56:54] the once sealed but now open book and
[1:56:56] present right now and claiming
[1:57:00] possession entitled by putting above the
[1:57:02] feet of his bride body as pillars of
[1:57:05] fire on the land and the sea with the
[1:57:08] beasts and the powers of Hell underneath
[1:57:11] his trenches feet hallelujah hey man
[1:57:18] just strikes me right there
[1:57:20] Church in the first picture it shows
[1:57:22] these demons
[1:57:24] it shows the king of the bottomless pit
[1:57:27] but in Revelation 10 it shows them all
[1:57:31] under your feet
[1:57:32] [Applause]
[1:57:35] hallelujah
[1:57:36] why get stuck in revelation 9 where we
[1:57:39] can look at revelation 10 and see these
[1:57:42] a evil demons are now beneath us that
[1:57:46] God has given you power over the
[1:57:49] American spirit and over there hang over
[1:57:51] that Roman spirit come on those two
[1:57:55] spirits that rises out of the land where
[1:57:57] there were no people which Miss America
[1:57:59] and the other haven't see where there
[1:58:01] was multitudes of Kindred's and tongues
[1:58:03] and people and yet God gives you power
[1:58:07] oh man why didn't fear the devil he's
[1:58:14] under your feet why didn't fear of the
[1:58:18] smoke and the torment and all that
[1:58:20] others I'm going through this scene with
[1:58:22] needs under your feet and revelation 10
[1:58:28] 8 or excuse me revelation 10 7 it's it
[1:58:32] happens in this age as we are anointed
[1:58:36] by Christ in this in time where was that
[1:58:39] anointing that was a 19 of Jesus Christ
[1:58:42] and the ministry of Jesus Christ in the
[1:58:46] seventh angels message
[1:58:48] we saw the Ministry of Christ repeat
[1:58:51] itself the healings the miracles the
[1:58:55] dominion over sin and diseases and evil
[1:58:58] come on did we see that but now you
[1:59:01] can't and here we go you can't have
[1:59:06] revelation 10 7 without having
[1:59:10] revelation 10 8 other people also rise
[1:59:16] into claim in the book of their
[1:59:18] inheritance and after digesting it and
[1:59:21] keeping it down you know there are a lot
[1:59:26] of people try to eat it they can't keep
[1:59:28] it down come on mmm but you made it you
[1:59:33] kept it down
[1:59:35] yeah someone has been difficult to
[1:59:36] swallow something up it's a little
[1:59:38] difficult to keep down but we just keep
[1:59:41] swatting it down
[1:59:43] yeah it makes your belly bitter but I'm
[1:59:48] gonna tell you it'll also begin to work
[1:59:50] on the inside it's turned on the inside
[1:59:55] of you until it comes out as a prophecy
[1:59:59] zabis prophesy again hallelujah
[2:00:05] hey man suggestions justice brother
[2:00:08] branham had a ministry so will the bride
[2:00:12] prophesy and do the mighty works of God
[2:00:18] now these these this all has to do with
[2:00:25] a word bride now remember I want to
[2:00:29] remind you true doctrine has its
[2:00:33] miracles the people are claiming
[2:00:36] doctrine and true doctor and there's no
[2:00:39] miracles but you cannot have true
[2:00:46] doctrine and not have miracles signs
[2:00:50] must follow believers God went with them
[2:00:58] confirming the word with signs following
[2:01:03] so signs must follow the word if we got
[2:01:07] the word there must be signs so don't
[2:01:11] tell me you got the word oh we don't
[2:01:13] believe in the gifts of the Spirit we
[2:01:14] don't believe in speaking in tongues we
[2:01:16] don't believe in prophesy we don't
[2:01:17] believe we don't believe well that's
[2:01:19] right you don't believe but I do and
[2:01:24] there's a difference but you see a true
[2:01:28] doctrine has miracles doctrines let me
[2:01:32] establish it without miracles is false
[2:01:35] doctrine it is not the doctrine of Jesus
[2:01:41] mark chapter 1 verse 27 and they were
[2:01:44] all amazing so much that the question
[2:01:47] among themselves saith
[2:01:48] what thing is this what new doctrine is
[2:01:51] this for with authority commandeth he
[2:01:54] even the unclean spirits and they do
[2:01:57] obey Him
[2:01:59] this is the trademart of true doctrine
[2:02:05] now so a word bride will be a bride
[2:02:10] known that she has the word by her
[2:02:14] miracles because God is always known by
[2:02:19] her miracles by his miracles now I
[2:02:22] listen to listen this in the Patmos
[2:02:25] vision brother Branham says that Paul
[2:02:27] said the word came in power as well as
[2:02:31] voice the word preached actually
[2:02:34] demonstrated itself like a flame and
[2:02:37] cutting sword it went to the
[2:02:38] consciousness of men and like a
[2:02:40] surgeon's knife and cut out the diseases
[2:02:43] and set the captives free and ever where
[2:02:46] those early believers went they went
[2:02:49] preaching the gospel the word and God
[2:02:51] confirmed that word with signs following
[2:02:53] the sick were healed devils were cast
[2:02:57] out they spoke in new tongues that was
[2:03:00] the word in action that word has never
[2:03:04] failed in the mouths of believing
[2:03:06] Christians and in this last agent is
[2:03:09] here stronger and greater than ever in
[2:03:12] the true word bride Oh little flop you
[2:03:15] little Minardi hold on to the word fill
[2:03:18] your mouths and your heart with it and
[2:03:21] someday God will give you the kingdom
[2:03:25] hallelujah amen so the word has never
[2:03:29] failed and it will not fail in those
[2:03:32] last days
[2:03:33] it'll be in the mouth of believing
[2:03:36] Christians not telling you what there's
[2:03:40] got to be a people in this day that's
[2:03:42] gets ready to speak to their mountains
[2:03:45] [Applause]
[2:03:46] doesn't matter what they are speak to
[2:03:48] them a man Jeter brother branham again
[2:03:52] said when Jesus on earth he said believe
[2:03:54] us now not I'm in the father and the
[2:03:55] father and me the words that I speak in
[2:03:57] you I speak not on myself
[2:03:59] but the father that dwelleth in me he do
[2:04:01] it the work John 14 10 therefore here is
[2:04:04] most evidently set forth the perfect
[2:04:07] manifestation of God and the son was by
[2:04:11] the indwelling spirit manifest in him in
[2:04:14] Word and works and this is exactly what
[2:04:19] we have been teaching all along when the
[2:04:22] bride will get back to me and they were
[2:04:25] bride and that's what we're hearing
[2:04:28] we're hearing it from all corners you
[2:04:30] got to be the word it's the word now
[2:04:31] brother Tim it's the word you know it's
[2:04:34] the word we we got to have the word you
[2:04:36] know it's now the word all right so when
[2:04:39] the would the bride will get back to
[2:04:41] being a word bride she will produce the
[2:04:46] very wants that Jesus produced the word
[2:04:50] is God the spirit is god they're all one
[2:04:53] and one cannot work apart from the other
[2:04:55] if one truly has the Spirit of God he
[2:04:58] will have the Word of God and the truth
[2:05:01] is if you have the word you're going to
[2:05:03] have the spirit and if you have the
[2:05:05] spirit I have to have the manifestation
[2:05:06] and you'll know if the Spirit is there
[2:05:09] by the manifestation if there is no
[2:05:11] manifestation there's no word there it's
[2:05:13] all Creed's dumbest ideas at man Sang's
[2:05:18] must follow them to me
[2:05:22] hey man again he says and if the church
[2:05:26] is the true church it will have the very
[2:05:29] same spirit and word and acts of power
[2:05:33] that they had at Pentecost and by
[2:05:37] experience it will be a Pentecostal
[2:05:40] church
[2:05:41] how's that for your nostalgia a man by
[2:05:46] experience it will be a Pentecostal
[2:05:50] church
[2:05:50] it's a shame people call that in the
[2:05:53] Salcha instead of something that is
[2:05:55] present tense but for some that's all
[2:05:58] you got is nostalgia you remember what
[2:06:01] used to be but to have nothing present
[2:06:03] now you have no power you have no
[2:06:07] healing that no miracle and no signs
[2:06:09] follow them them that believe let me
[2:06:17] read it and if the church is the true
[2:06:20] church
[2:06:21] I mean I'm part of that true church it
[2:06:24] will have the very same spirit and word
[2:06:28] and acts power that they had at
[2:06:32] Pentecost by experience it will be a
[2:06:35] Pentecostal church and there will be
[2:06:39] tons and interpretation and prophecy and
[2:06:44] healings and God will be in her myths
[2:06:48] and God will declare himself in the
[2:06:50] midst of her as he always has hallelujah
[2:06:53] and she will be unorganized don't forget
[2:06:55] that so all your kingdom builders go
[2:06:59] line up somewhere else you don't belong
[2:07:01] in the bride amen now I just want to go
[2:07:08] on record this morning
[2:07:09] and I'm I don't have an axe to grind I'm
[2:07:13] just saying I want to thank I want to
[2:07:17] thank my critics and my friends who
[2:07:23] called me Pentecostal because I am
[2:07:28] Pentecostal
[2:07:38] and please don't say Arlene Pentecostal
[2:07:43] or then I got one foot in Pentecost
[2:07:50] because you see you know it's like a
