able to meet needs but we serve a God who and it doesn't matter what you're going through what sickness that you're facing what trouble that you have our God is a and I believe that we're in the [Music] time Hallelujah I believe we're living in the time of super amen it wasn't just for yesterday cuz what good is a god of yesterday if we can talk about what he used do we know the scripture says he Amen brother brand would say it like this he said I believe that the age has come now the miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of the spirit with power signs wonders this great pouring out of God's spirit in the last days are we in the last days in the last day and that is the thing that will bring Faith in that'll take a Rapture in faith the church in the glory so I I don't know about you more [Music] healing more more of God not less of God not a god of yesterday not a god of tomorrow but a god of right now that is what has been released in this AG it's released the phenomenal the miraculous released the Baptist of the Holy Ghost just as it was on the day of Amen just as P out the miraculous in the first Amen in the first Exodus there was great signs and great wonders there was a pillar of fire that appear a message came and it said let my people amen just as it poured out the miraculous he came and showed himself person with signs and great amen in the second Exodus he came with signs and great he healed the sick he raed the dead he made the lame one there was a light that appeared on Amen and a message that said let my people go but he's also coming this day we are in the Third Exodus we're leaving this it's not going to be less miraculous it's going to be more miraculous God is going to pour out his presence upon his I say right now it's our is Our Moment this is your time God has for ordained this moment Foundation he knew you would be sitting langu he knew the pain and he has the ability to rewrite it all hallelujah hallelujah so in the first Exodus there were signs and wers second Exodus Third Exodus and wonders first Exodus there was a pillar of fire second Exodus Third Exodus that pillar fire still Among Us amen it didn't leave when a Prophet come on now it'll lead you divine to Divine Healing it'll lead you to the Holy Ghost it'll lead you all things are possible amen you say well we're in a very difficult time well the first Exodus was a very difficult a lot press amen and it got worse and worse second Exodus same way Exodus is going to be same way another thing that's very interesting at every Exodus was the killing of children amen first Exodus second Exodus you know King's decree kill years and now we see it in our generation Children of The Unborn what is it a sign of that we're leaving here it's a sign that there's a God who does not forget his promises but he's going to bring them to pass we have also received Angel and the angel came with a message and he said let my people go amen and it took us out of our Creed took us out of our dog and our manmade ideas brought into a land amen a spiritual land spiritual promise that God will not forget one of them but he will bring them to pass amen nothing but the miraculous we saw

who can handle word they can almost make any intellectual person if they're trusting in their intellect that they would condemn the Holy Spirit and take the way of man but see people are rejecting

wanted a child she her husband seen that she was really getting down and depressed so he takes her to their Pastor you can help me with this and she just begins to unload her burden and the pastor looked at her I forget her name and he said sister if God doesn't give you a child then what M she sat there and looked at him tear began to roll out her face she said I'll still serve him in just a few months she was expecting a child and today she has [Applause] a amen if God does then what I'll still it matters not but I know he will do he said he would do will not [Music] return will ACC it
