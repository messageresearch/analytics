[2:46] you
[2:50] amen
[2:53] like Michael said thank you so much for
[2:55] for coming out tonight for this
[2:57] testimony night and a night of
[2:58] Fellowship you know it was brother
[3:00] Michael's uh desire to do something like
[3:03] this a few months back and then begin
[3:05] talking and and you know it's we've been
[3:07] blessed as a church in many many ways
[3:10] and the Lord the Lord has seen fit in
[3:12] the last few years to to to have
[3:15] families that have moved in and to
[3:17] become part of us a part of our church
[3:19] family and and brother Michael's desire
[3:21] was you know he said we don't want to
[3:23] become a a church full of people who
[3:26] don't know one another and so we wanted
[3:28] to have opportunity for for people to to
[3:31] give their testimonies not only to give
[3:33] them opportunity to share but to give us
[3:36] opportunity to learn about them and know
[3:37] their backstories like like brother
[3:39] Michael said and so I first met the the
[3:43] parishes a little over two years ago at
[3:45] the Easter camp that we had here because
[3:48] we couldn't go down to to the Youth Camp
[3:51] so we had a meeting here and and I guess
[3:54] coming up in August they would have been
[3:55] here two years I believe it was in
[3:57] August about two years and and it's been
[4:00] a pleasure to have them as part of our
[4:02] our church family they've been a real
[4:04] blessing to many and so tonight I just
[4:07] want you to join me in welcoming them as
[4:10] they come to to share their story about
[4:12] what God has done in their life
[4:18] [Applause]
[4:29] yeah
[4:34] and I get I guess kind of the format
[4:36] that we want to
[4:38] talk about a little bit tonight would be
[4:39] to take take your lives as individuals
[4:42] briefly your childhood your upbringing
[4:45] bring it right up to the point of where
[4:48] y'all met one another and then from
[4:50] there obviously it'll be a story that
[4:52] that you can tell together but what
[4:54] we'll do if it's okay with y'all is
[4:56] we'll start with you okay and and your
[4:59] upbringing your childhood we'll start
[5:01] right at the very beginning where were
[5:03] you born yeah I was born actually just
[5:05] outside of Washington DC uh my my folks
[5:10] had moved down from upstate New York my
[5:12] dad was a police officer and so he
[5:13] started working with an agency there in
[5:16] in the District of Columbia and so I was
[5:19] born in Virginia so just across south of
[5:22] the Potomac River and um but I would
[5:25] actually grow up most of my life just in
[5:27] the inside of Maryland so so born born
[5:30] in Virginia yeah your dad is a police
[5:33] officer I was trying to find the
[5:34] Mason-Dixon Line in there
[5:36] he was close he's close to it so your
[5:40] dad was a police officer tell me a
[5:42] little bit about
[5:43] um your home life as far as was your
[5:46] family Believers yeah
[5:48] um
[5:49] my earliest memories were were Church
[5:52] home church we um my parents got saved
[5:56] when I was probably two and a half or
[5:58] three years old
[5:59] um my dad's mom was a Believer had
[6:01] attended some of brother branham's
[6:03] meetings in Upstate New York
[6:05] so the message was very early in their
[6:09] family so Church you know nobody knew
[6:12] what really a church was outside of
[6:14] they'd left the denominations and so you
[6:16] just had Church in your house so I
[6:18] remember like
[6:20] people would come through our home like
[6:22] Jackie Benton Ned Iverson
[6:26] Ron Walbert and you know different
[6:28] different ministers would come through
[6:30] and preach
[6:31] now Moses was it in your home yeah they
[6:34] would actually come to our house and
[6:36] what kind of group did you have meet in
[6:37] there just family mostly just family and
[6:39] then a couple of couple of other family
[6:41] members and a pastor eventually moved in
[6:43] and established a little church there so
[6:45] we did in the early years growing up
[6:48] have a home have a church there so at
[6:51] some point
[6:52] um it seemed to me like y'all moved out
[6:54] west is that right yeah we did
[6:56] um my dad took a job as a welder in the
[7:00] oil rig industry and
[7:02] and I that he knew kind of took us off
[7:05] to South Dakota so we lived in the very
[7:07] southern part of South Dakota for a
[7:09] little while about a year and we just
[7:12] had tapes to listen to so it was like
[7:14] being in the desert nearly you'd say
[7:16] spiritually so I'm probably eight nine
[7:18] years old at the time and spent a year
[7:21] there and then spent two years two the
[7:22] next two years 80 81 in Oklahoma
[7:26] so what part of Oklahoma Claremore okay
[7:29] clear more area where yeah brother Rice
[7:31] is now yes okay yeah right there so
[7:33] you're born
[7:35] first seven eight years you're in
[7:37] Maryland and that's when y'all head to
[7:39] South Dakota yep it's been about a year
[7:41] there then you end up in in Claremore
[7:43] Oklahoma Claremore Oklahoma and you have
[7:45] the picture Michael of um
[7:47] brother Ivan and sister Ruth
[7:52] I ran across a picture today
[7:56] so while he's looking for that when
[7:57] you're in Claremore yeah do you all have
[8:00] a church there yeah there's a church I
[8:02] think there were two churches there if I
[8:04] if I remember correctly uh it's pretty
[8:06] little but I know we went to two
[8:09] different churches there but my dad
[8:11] didn't really really feel connected uh
[8:14] spiritually in that direction and he
[8:16] wanted to get back to Maryland my mom
[8:18] did really bad because that's where they
[8:21] felt like home was
[8:22] so we ended up moving back while we're
[8:24] there two things there's a there's a
[8:27] connection even with this church that
[8:28] you made while you're in Claremore yeah
[8:30] because you run across what family there
[8:34] I run across the wrestlers like to the
[8:37] degree of brother Ivan had to kill two
[8:39] goats to feed both our families
[8:41] [Applause]
[8:43] I guess I haven't disclosed I'm from a
[8:46] family of nine kids so I'm number three
[8:49] in the in the chain and so I've got
[8:53] five siblings uh yeah so there's the
[8:57] first four of us so that's in Maryland
[8:58] before we we go out west did you find
[9:01] the other picture brother Michael okay
[9:03] so there's a picture I found today of um
[9:06] of sister Ruth's dad and her standing
[9:10] with my dad and they got a picture so
[9:12] that would have been 1979 1980. so at
[9:17] this point in Oklahoma are there already
[9:20] nine of y'all kids yeah so we're we've
[9:22] the whole band is is uh together there
[9:26] literally that's why I took two goats
[9:28] that's why I took two goats so so at
[9:31] this point y'all moved back to Maryland
[9:33] same town
[9:35] um nearly the same town the same area
[9:36] first for sure yeah but a different
[9:39] house
[9:40] um but the same folks the same people
[9:42] that we've we fellowshipped with
[9:44] um before we left we came back to the
[9:47] same area and your dad goes back to
[9:49] being a police officer goes back to
[9:51] being a police officer and um actually
[9:54] is a as a teacher so he kind of was into
[9:57] teaching he had a degree so he could
[9:59] kind of run run both sides
[10:03] did your mom work no Mom was too busy
[10:06] mom was a stay-at-home it's hard to work
[10:08] with she worked she worked she worked
[10:10] with nine kids she worked out dad worked
[10:12] really hard too um I don't remember a
[10:15] day my dad not working hard
[10:18] um he was a welder so a steel worker
[10:20] they're very hard-working people they
[10:22] generally don't take the pay for what
[10:24] they do because they feel like it's the
[10:26] labor of their hands and you know they
[10:28] want to be able to give back so that was
[10:30] a lot of the years that I was impressed
[10:32] upon me of just the the work ethic
[10:35] so so we're back in Maryland and you
[10:38] let's just put you around the age of 12
[10:39] 13 14 somewhere in there church is a big
[10:42] part of your life yes yeah and you made
[10:44] mention even the did your dad lead songs
[10:46] yeah my dad LED songs for a number of
[10:48] years I don't really remember how many I
[10:51] I remember sitting in the back of the
[10:52] car I mean you've got all the kids piled
[10:55] in the car and somebody's got to pick
[10:57] songs because Dad's leading song service
[10:59] that usually felt my lot so I'm going
[11:02] through the only belief song book you
[11:04] know picking my favorite songs for song
[11:06] service
[11:07] you had an influence on the service at a
[11:10] young age very young age so we hit high
[11:13] school and
[11:15] I had a memory um
[11:17] I even remember the type of chair that I
[11:20] was sitting in I was probably 12 years
[11:21] old
[11:23] it had the Chrome like they were it's
[11:25] sectional so it had like a long bench
[11:28] but each
[11:30] chair had its own end of they were all
[11:32] connected and they had the Chrome
[11:33] handles and like a teal
[11:36] vinyl seat pretty slippery but as a 12
[11:40] year old kid I'm sitting there and I'm
[11:42] hearing the preaching and he's preaching
[11:45] about pharaoh and Moses and just how
[11:49] Pharaoh was used as a tool
[11:52] Moses was elected of God and I was like
[11:54] oh that would be the awfulest thing to
[11:57] turn out to be a pharaoh I would not
[11:59] ever want to be a pharaoh I I want to be
[12:02] a Moses good call
[12:05] but as a young person
[12:08] that impressed me sure
[12:11] um but not actually not feeling God ever
[12:13] deal with me in that regard but just as
[12:16] a just an understanding that God has
[12:19] elect but God also has tools that he
[12:22] uses that he discards after use yeah
[12:25] so at a young age you recognize the need
[12:28] to be a Moses yes so you have a you know
[12:33] church is a big part of your life but
[12:35] would you say there's ever an experience
[12:37] with God in your youth at all no not
[12:39] beyond that um that would probably be
[12:41] the only if you call that an experience
[12:44] an understanding
[12:46] um but that really that was it so when
[12:47] you hit your high school years would you
[12:49] say did you begin to drift from church
[12:52] yeah as a 15 16 year old I saw the need
[12:56] for money so I saw the need for a job
[13:01] um I was able to get a job get a car and
[13:03] there started the the Trek away from
[13:06] home I started to miss church and it
[13:09] became just common in the home that you
[13:12] could be at home but not have to go to
[13:14] church my oldest brother had gone away
[13:16] to college and come back and he brought
[13:18] everything from the world back home
[13:20] and um
[13:22] yeah so those were the years
[13:24] where Church became less of an influence
[13:27] you graduate high school and you don't
[13:29] stick around do you no I don't stick
[13:32] around I was 18 years old and I met the
[13:35] military recruiter at high school and I
[13:39] wanted to be a cop I wanted to be like
[13:40] my dad
[13:42] but I had this problem with age you
[13:45] can't be a cop until you're 21 and carry
[13:46] a gun but the marine recruiter said
[13:49] we'll let you carry a gun right out of
[13:51] boot camp like no problem and that was
[13:53] pretty attractive to me so I signed up
[13:56] for six years like why not you can
[13:59] be a marine carry a gun for six years
[14:01] and
[14:02] um
[14:03] that'd be great so for timetable's sake
[14:05] what year are we in right now we're 1989
[14:08] going into 1990. and you sign up and
[14:11] they're shipping you to boot camp where
[14:12] the week after I get out of high school
[14:15] I'm on the bus to boot camp Paris Island
[14:18] South Carolina
[14:20] and this is about the time we're
[14:21] starting to have trouble in the Middle
[14:22] East yeah in 1990 91 somewhere in there
[14:25] we have Desert Storm right yeah August
[14:27] of 1990 I think Desert Storm kicks off
[14:30] look at that fella there
[14:32] oh my goodness
[14:34] yeah
[14:36] I was
[14:38] so so Desert Storm starts and the way it
[14:41] works if I remember right with you
[14:43] talking to me is
[14:44] you're in training to go but the war
[14:46] only lasts a few days it lasts a hundred
[14:49] days and I'd come out of boot camp gone
[14:51] to a school they sent me to another
[14:53] school a special ops school for
[14:55] anti-terrorism because that was a big
[14:57] deal in the world starting in about
[14:58] Beirut so 85.
[15:00] um
[15:01] so I was supposed to be going
[15:03] immediately to the desert and they
[15:05] stopped all deployments like nobody else
[15:07] went so no Marines were coming back so I
[15:10] went to another school and then another
[15:11] school so I probably went to four four
[15:13] or five schools in that time because the
[15:15] schools were empty because everybody was
[15:17] over there yeah so it was a situation
[15:19] where the war ended but they hadn't come
[15:20] back yet correct so what all did you get
[15:22] trained in just curious yeah so I I'd be
[15:25] um we were in a small unit so everybody
[15:27] kind of had to wear a lot of hats so I
[15:29] became a an ammunition driver so I went
[15:32] to the ammo depot and picked up all the
[15:35] ammunition that we would need I would
[15:36] drive five ton trucks because I had my
[15:39] driver's license I could get a bus
[15:41] license so I drove all the Marines
[15:43] so we go out to the out to the range and
[15:46] we'd shoot three hundred thousand
[15:48] dollars worth of ammunition in a week
[15:50] and I went through a swimming instructor
[15:53] School
[15:54] did that over in Japan as well flew
[15:57] helicopters and jumped out of the back
[15:59] of helicopters into the ocean did us a
[16:02] boat School learn how to drive boats to
[16:04] take Marines to the beach and you also
[16:07] uh mentioned like a pre-sniper school or
[16:09] something like that yeah that was part
[16:10] of the special ops unit you have to wear
[16:12] a lot of hats so
[16:14] um SWAT is kind of the catchphrase in
[16:17] the secular world and I did the sniper
[16:21] portion of what you would call a SWAT
[16:23] team so at this point in your life you
[16:26] loving the Marines yeah the Marines is a
[16:28] lot of fun we're busy we're deployed all
[16:31] the time where there's a lot of things
[16:33] happening and it's pretty exciting
[16:38] this brings us pretty close to the point
[16:40] of
[16:41] meeting her as well right yeah so at
[16:44] some point you end up in California yeah
[16:48] that's where I'd gone to this this
[16:49] special unit so I was there about two
[16:51] years
[16:52] and we were deployed a lot but on one of
[16:54] those deployments I came back and I I'm
[16:56] at Debbie
[16:57] so unless there's something else that
[17:00] you want to add I'm going to skip over
[17:01] to sister that's good
[17:03] where were you born
[17:05] so I was born in Baltimore Maryland
[17:07] which is Derek and I are two weeks apart
[17:11] in age and we were born 45 minutes away
[17:14] from each other in the same area
[17:16] so Baltimore Maryland for me and Falls
[17:19] Church for Derek so um my dad worked for
[17:24] Levi Strauss and when I was five years
[17:26] old he got transferred to California
[17:29] so when I say where I'm from I don't
[17:32] often say Baltimore Maryland because I
[17:34] didn't grow up there I don't have any
[17:35] real connections there I say that I was
[17:38] raised in Napa California which is the
[17:41] wine valley that's where that's the area
[17:43] I grew up in
[17:45] no now there said that brother Derek
[17:48] tells us that his family was message
[17:50] Believers yours were not no
[17:54] um
[17:54] I guess by association Catholic yes to
[17:58] what degree are y'all at Mass every week
[18:00] or no no Easter Christmas Catholics and
[18:04] I don't think it was even every Easter
[18:06] and every
[18:08] it was occasionally occasional Easter an
[18:13] occasional Christmas so you spend the
[18:16] majority of your childhood
[18:18] in Napa yes California with a really
[18:22] good moral upright family that was
[18:26] giving the worked in the community they
[18:29] volunteered at the state hospital they
[18:31] volunteered for Special Olympics
[18:34] just a really a good family and a family
[18:37] that respected God and would never let
[18:43] anyone around them take the name of the
[18:45] Lord in vain is what my mom would say
[18:47] like you would never do something like
[18:49] that
[18:50] when I was in third grade my parents
[18:53] moved me to a private school in town a
[18:56] seven-day Adventist School not because
[18:58] we had any affiliation with seven-day
[19:01] Adventist or even knew anything about it
[19:03] but it was just a good private school in
[19:05] town so they sent me there so as far as
[19:09] my religious upbringing I always say
[19:11] well it was really Seventh-day Adventist
[19:14] because I went there from third grade to
[19:16] eighth grade so all of my Bible stories
[19:18] and foundation and everything came from
[19:21] The Seventh-Day Adventist
[19:23] before we move on
[19:25] there was a story you told that just
[19:28] shows the hand of God you know in your
[19:29] life uh something that happened when you
[19:32] were five years old when your parents
[19:34] were having a get together at their
[19:36] house I believe it was around Christmas
[19:37] was that right it was it was a Christmas
[19:39] my dad was having a company Christmas
[19:41] party so tell us that story so we I grew
[19:44] up on the river so in in Napa there's a
[19:47] river that flows through and we had a
[19:50] dock and a boat and but I was not you
[19:55] know obviously not allowed to go down
[19:56] there and be unsupervised well they were
[19:58] having a party that night and
[20:01] whatever got into my mind I decided to
[20:04] go down to the dock because I wanted to
[20:06] see the Ducks
[20:07] and I leaned over the dock and fell
[20:12] promptly fell right in
[20:14] at that moment my grandfather had
[20:17] actually stepped outside and he saw it
[20:21] happen
[20:21] if he had not stepped outside at that
[20:24] moment I would not have lived because I
[20:26] remember being underwater I remember
[20:28] reaching up I remember going down and
[20:31] coming up like the typical they say you
[20:33] you know like Bob three times and and
[20:35] that's it I remember that I remember
[20:37] being under the dock and not being able
[20:40] to reach up but he saw it happen so he
[20:43] ran down reached into the water and
[20:45] pulled me out
[20:53] well little stories like that actually
[20:55] kind of connected us when we first met
[20:57] gives the same thing nearly happened to
[21:00] me
[21:01] um my oldest brother and sister we like
[21:03] to catch Bullfrogs we had a pond in
[21:05] front of our place and I mean bullfrogs
[21:07] are fun to catch when you're a little
[21:08] kid so we're all peering over the edge
[21:10] of the dock and my brother pushed me in
[21:12] to catch one
[21:13] because it seemed like the thing to do
[21:15] that's what brothers do
[21:18] we couldn't swim I had five
[21:21] so I I tried to doggy paddle or
[21:24] something but I'm just going down and
[21:26] and my sister just reaches into the muck
[21:28] of the pond and feels around and feels
[21:30] my hand and pulls me out you're the same
[21:32] and I was the same age five years old
[21:34] and five years yeah
[21:36] we talked the other the other evening
[21:38] and you mentioned another neat story
[21:40] that I think the people would enjoy at
[21:42] some point uh you ended up getting moved
[21:45] to a Catholic school is that right in
[21:48] 10th Grade and there's a story about
[21:49] your First Holy Communion that
[21:52] um that I think is is very interesting
[21:54] because you had had all these lessons in
[21:57] The Seventh-Day Adventist Church and now
[21:59] you're with the Catholic Church those
[22:02] two don't necessarily see things exactly
[22:04] the same no and so tell us about the
[22:07] First Holy Communion that whole thing
[22:09] yes so with the Catholics you um
[22:12] normally you're five years old I happen
[22:15] to be 10 so I was late going through it
[22:17] but you go to classes before you're
[22:20] allowed to take that first communion so
[22:23] I went through all the classes and I
[22:26] don't remember them at all but I did it
[22:28] and then at the end of the classes
[22:30] you're supposed to go to a priest meet
[22:32] with a priest
[22:33] recite your little thing and confess
[22:36] your sins and so I went
[22:40] for some reason it wasn't a confessional
[22:42] box like they normally have I actually
[22:45] went to his office and it was just him
[22:47] and I and he's
[22:50] you know waiting for me to recite my
[22:53] thing and and tell my sins and I'm 10
[22:56] years old and I look him in the eye and
[22:59] I said if Jesus died for my sins
[23:02] and the curtain rent from the top to the
[23:05] bottom which means I don't have to come
[23:09] and confess my sins to you I can tell it
[23:11] right to Jesus
[23:13] and he just looked at me and he said go
[23:16] say ten Hail Mary's
[23:21] and promptly sent me out of his office
[23:23] so he didn't even have anything to say
[23:25] but in my heart I was like all right
[23:26] that's the truth because he did not want
[23:28] to he didn't want to deal with that so I
[23:31] went and kneeled down at the at the Pew
[23:34] and didn't say my ten Hill Mary's and
[23:36] walked out and I'm pretty sure I was not
[23:38] in a Catholic church again after that
[23:43] so I know we're moving rather rather
[23:45] quickly but at some point we ended up
[23:48] toward towards you know late Middle
[23:50] School maybe early high school years and
[23:52] and
[23:53] fall in with the wrong Crown I do I do
[23:55] just briefly tell us a little bit about
[23:57] that and where you know how your family
[23:59] reacted to that yeah so in eighth grade
[24:02] I
[24:03] I didn't want to be in private school
[24:05] anymore it was it was Junior High years
[24:08] and that's when things get weird with
[24:10] friends and everything and so I told my
[24:13] parents that I didn't want to go to that
[24:15] school anymore and that I wanted to go
[24:16] to public school and they let me so I
[24:20] went on to public school
[24:22] started out okay and then quickly became
[24:25] not okay
[24:27] I got in with the wrong
[24:30] crowd of people
[24:31] um
[24:32] just the the new waivers the the
[24:37] purple hair you know all of this all of
[24:39] that stuff so that's the group of people
[24:42] that I felt comfortable with because
[24:45] um
[24:45] I don't know I just did so I wound up in
[24:49] the wrong crowd of people and taking me
[24:52] down a wrong path we're not here to
[24:53] judge you but I just got to ask did you
[24:55] have purple hair I did okay I just
[24:58] wanted to know if you were just hanging
[25:00] out with them or if you had the purple
[25:01] hair too it was brief it was brief and
[25:04] even the time in the public school is
[25:06] brief because my parents saw obviously I
[25:08] mean your child's got purple hair
[25:09] there's problems you got problems
[25:12] um so it really in 10th Grade they took
[25:15] me out of public school and sent me to
[25:18] boarding school you know I find that
[25:21] extremely interesting because I guess I
[25:23] knew that boarding schools still existed
[25:25] but typically you think of that as being
[25:27] something
[25:28] way old-fashioned way back in the day
[25:31] but they just told you okay we're
[25:32] sending you to live at school was there
[25:35] a religious affiliation to this school
[25:37] back to the Seventh-day Adventist
[25:39] s they really did have a big part in
[25:41] your life so tell us just just briefly
[25:43] how long you were at boarding school how
[25:45] that experience was for you so it was
[25:47] good it did get me out of that group of
[25:49] friends and well I mean the funny thing
[25:52] about boarding school is you've got rich
[25:54] kids there so the rich kids are going to
[25:56] boarding school and a lot of them are
[25:58] getting sent there because they were
[25:59] like me and they got in with the wrong
[26:01] crowd so I laughed and told my parents
[26:04] after the fact I said there was way more
[26:06] drugs at boarding school than I ever had
[26:09] opportunity to get to in public school
[26:13] but I wasn't doing that there to be
[26:14] honest
[26:15] um I did get in with a nice group of of
[26:17] kids and things were going well for a
[26:20] while
[26:21] but then I turned I was turning 18 and I
[26:25] just decided that I didn't want to be
[26:26] there anymore
[26:28] and because I was turning 18 I called my
[26:31] parents and I said I'm turning 18 if you
[26:34] don't come pick me up I'm just gonna
[26:36] walk
[26:37] and they came and picked me up
[26:40] so at the age of 18 you're done with
[26:41] school I'm done and it's ridiculous
[26:43] because it was January of my senior year
[26:45] like I could have just finished but no
[26:49] so you moved back home yes and things go
[26:52] swimmingly
[26:54] um no
[26:55] because I've still got this uh attitude
[26:58] and
[27:00] um
[27:00] my parents you know they say okay fine
[27:02] you're not going to be in school you got
[27:03] to get your GED you've got to get a job
[27:06] and I said great that's what I want to
[27:08] do anyway so I got the job but I wasn't
[27:11] getting along with my parents
[27:13] um so at 19 years old I moved out
[27:17] and what year are we in 19 1990
[27:24] approaching
[27:27] so let's try to bring this together yeah
[27:30] so
[27:31] you tell me how you end up yeah
[27:34] on the day that you meet her so the base
[27:37] that I'm stationed at is on the Oakland
[27:39] side of the San Francisco Bay Area
[27:42] and a lot of times the guys on the base
[27:44] would either stay there they'd go to
[27:46] Sacramento or go to San Francisco and
[27:49] um one of the guys said let's go to Napa
[27:51] I'm like what do you do in Napa he goes
[27:54] I don't know let's go find out so we
[27:56] drive to Napa with not a lot of
[27:58] understanding of where things are or
[28:00] anything and we find a bar to pull into
[28:03] and we pull over it's I mean it's early
[28:05] in the AFT like I'd say early in the
[28:07] evening it's like eight nine o'clock at
[28:09] night not really late and um I'm the
[28:12] designated driver
[28:14] so we're just hanging out seeing who
[28:15] shows up at this place and uh shooting
[28:18] pool and
[28:20] I meet Debbie mm-hmm I'm sitting at the
[28:23] other end of the bar
[28:25] oh he's cute are you in uniform I have
[28:28] to know no okay I mean I looked to like
[28:33] it because I didn't have any hair I got
[28:35] you yeah and and so y'all meet each
[28:37] other and it was interesting because
[28:40] y'all told me y'all clicked right off
[28:43] the bat because born in the same place a
[28:45] lot of same life experience yeah we
[28:47] started sharing stories of like where
[28:49] are you from where are you from and oh
[28:51] really oh that's interesting oh that
[28:53] happened to me too oh that's kind of
[28:55] weird so and then she tells me she's
[28:57] going back to Maryland the next day so
[29:00] we just really connected
[29:02] instantly connected instantly into the
[29:05] level
[29:06] yes so I was leaving on vacation and
[29:10] um
[29:11] so I had not dated a lot amazingly when
[29:14] uh during this time period of my teens
[29:17] and everything because anytime I would
[29:19] be talking to someone if it would start
[29:21] to get serious I would cut it off like I
[29:24] did not want any kind of serious
[29:26] relationships so
[29:28] um usually a boy would last like two
[29:30] weeks and that would be it and so anyway
[29:34] met Derek and then the next day going
[29:36] back to Maryland to be with family I
[29:40] told my family I met the man I'm going
[29:42] to marry
[29:43] she didn't tell me that
[29:46] I took it so far as to go to an antique
[29:49] store on this trip and buy something
[29:52] that looked like an engagement ring and
[29:54] put it on my finger and wear it for that
[29:56] whole trip because I did not even want
[29:58] anybody else to even talk to me
[30:01] no
[30:07] later Revelation later but not long
[30:11] so so
[30:13] take me through this this Whirlwind
[30:15] relationship you're in the military yeah
[30:19] you're deployed I get deployed like
[30:21] immediately with within a a couple of
[30:24] weeks of us meeting that is
[30:26] um we met in July and this is November
[30:30] so July of 92
[30:34] and this is November of 92. this was
[30:37] like our first pictures together
[30:39] so um you get deployed pretty quickly I
[30:43] get deployed twice in this time frame
[30:46] deployed in October I came back for this
[30:49] um Marine Corps ball
[30:51] and then I got deployed again in late
[30:54] December early January it wasn't a trip
[30:56] that we were planning but it ended up
[30:57] being almost four months long
[31:00] we got stationed up in Bremerton
[31:01] Washington it's kind of funny I remember
[31:03] I remember being there and saying you
[31:06] me a million dollars to live in this
[31:09] state it rains constantly
[31:11] I mean where did I live for 25 years
[31:14] that that's how it works right there
[31:17] yeah so at some point
[31:22] there's this um I don't know how to put
[31:25] it rational decision yes that y'all
[31:28] should get married it wasn't necessarily
[31:31] your typical thought process on marriage
[31:35] no it was fairly practical well we
[31:38] really liked each other a lot that helps
[31:40] so we wanted to we wanted to spend time
[31:43] together and I'm getting ready to be
[31:46] permanently a permanent Duty station
[31:48] change from the west coast to the east
[31:51] coast I'm going all the way to North
[31:53] Carolina for the next four years and
[31:55] that's a long time to be away from Napa
[31:58] so we had this couple of conversations
[32:00] on the phone in January of 93 and I said
[32:04] you know it really makes sense to me
[32:08] if you were to go with me now it would
[32:10] be expensive though because we'd have to
[32:12] get a house off the base and it's not
[32:15] really going to look very good if we're
[32:16] not married so
[32:18] don't you think we should get married
[32:19] [Applause]
[32:21] of course I didn't know that that has
[32:24] been sitting there all along she's been
[32:26] waiting on you to yeah
[32:29] [Applause]
[32:31] he wasn't there there was no down on a
[32:33] knee here's a rain situation no I just
[32:35] popped that she asked me
[32:37] I'm on a pay phone in the barracks in a
[32:41] hallway on a knee
[32:44] I know no pictures to prove it but there
[32:46] I was
[32:48] no special moment
[32:51] so
[32:52] she agrees she agrees that it would be
[32:54] cheaper if y'all get married because
[32:55] y'all can live on base it's just a smart
[32:57] thing to do because they'll pay for us
[32:59] to move it and you move like they give
[33:03] you a house there makes perfect sense
[33:04] makes all the sense in the world
[33:08] all right so
[33:10] you told a story that I that I loved
[33:12] about trying to
[33:14] convince your commanding officer yeah
[33:16] that you are going to get married but in
[33:18] order to do it you had to be allowed to
[33:21] come home early I do I've got to leave
[33:23] the deployment early to come home to get
[33:25] married and
[33:26] about three months out I start trying to
[33:29] convince my commanding officer that I
[33:31] need to be let loose early then
[33:34] everybody else everybody else got to
[33:35] stay behind and I'm going to get married
[33:37] and so he did everything he could to
[33:40] convince me to not go so one night I'm
[33:43] out walking Dry Dock on a nuclear sub
[33:45] and he comes out there he says oh
[33:48] I don't know if I was a lance corporal
[33:50] or I probably was just a kid he goes so
[33:54] understanding is you want to get married
[33:56] yes sir
[33:58] he says you realize you have to go home
[34:00] early
[34:01] said yes sir
[34:03] you know I've seen a thousand of them
[34:05] not work out
[34:06] probably not the thing you want to do I
[34:08] said no I really love her sir no I've
[34:10] heard that a thousand times
[34:12] he says well tell you what I'm going to
[34:14] do he says I'm gonna give you six months
[34:16] to think about it see that ship over
[34:18] there that's the Nimitz it's sales in
[34:20] the morning I'll cut you orders and you
[34:21] can be on it
[34:23] and I'll let her know that you just
[34:25] couldn't come home
[34:26] I was like
[34:28] gulp
[34:30] I can't do that sir
[34:32] so so I had to convince him that I
[34:34] wanted to go home and get married so
[34:36] after he tried to talk you out of it and
[34:38] it was just uh you were convinced that
[34:41] cheaper was the way to go
[34:45] so you all get married and you come home
[34:48] you're planning a wedding this whole
[34:49] time the whole thing all by yourself so
[34:51] it's a good thing that your officer lets
[34:53] you come home early yeah because there
[34:54] was a wedding being planned it was and
[34:57] we have pigs
[34:58] and y'all get married in what year
[35:01] in April of 93 yeah
[35:04] 33. now I'm gonna stop right there for a
[35:06] minute
[35:07] all this time yeah
[35:10] all this time has been a couple of
[35:12] months no no no all this time
[35:16] nine nine months nine months I'm
[35:20] referencing all this time meaning when
[35:22] you left home oh yeah till now yeah
[35:24] we've been about three years
[35:27] has Church the message God any of that
[35:32] playing any role in your life at all
[35:35] um no no except one moment
[35:39] um when we met with the Episcopal priest
[35:42] who was gonna marry us uh we had to meet
[35:45] with him because he's got to tell us you
[35:47] know what's going to happen and I'm he
[35:48] says I'm going to stand up here and you
[35:50] know the whole Entourage and I said when
[35:53] you go to pray for us will you will you
[35:56] pray for us and end your prayer in the
[35:59] name of Jesus Christ and not in the the
[36:01] trinity
[36:04] he just kind of looked at us he goes
[36:06] yeah I can do that and I I don't know
[36:09] why I had that in me just to ask or to
[36:12] say but like that was the only fleeting
[36:16] passing thought of God or any kind of
[36:19] Truth had to be in the name of the Lord
[36:22] Jesus Christ yeah
[36:24] it was important
[36:25] so she knows nothing of your upbringing
[36:28] no y'all are getting married and how
[36:30] many times have you met his family zero
[36:32] zero yeah
[36:34] um
[36:35] yeah so let's fast forward to the first
[36:39] meeting yeah there comes a time where
[36:41] you're going home to see family how long
[36:44] have y'all been married
[36:47] a couple of months a couple of months
[36:49] we're married and I'm getting stationed
[36:51] in North Carolina so we have a couple
[36:53] extra days to drive across the country
[36:56] and um she smiles because it was an
[36:58] exciting trip
[37:00] and
[37:01] uh and meet my folks so she's never like
[37:06] I haven't told her my background it's
[37:09] interesting when you're in the military
[37:10] you're either Catholic or you're
[37:12] Protestant or you're
[37:14] um Pentecostal or your Baptist or
[37:16] something and I grew up in a little tiny
[37:19] Message Church from the time I was born
[37:21] I don't even know what a Pentecostal is
[37:23] I don't know what a Baptist is I've
[37:25] never been exposed to anybody I don't
[37:27] know what a Protestant is
[37:28] I don't know the difference between all
[37:30] these things so I would always just say
[37:31] I'm just a Christian
[37:33] so when she asked me what's my religion
[37:36] I would just say I'm a Christian
[37:38] so your your level of shelter even went
[37:41] to the fact of not even understanding
[37:43] other religions or anything at all at
[37:45] all let alone what I believed
[37:49] true yeah
[37:51] so y'all are heading to meet your family
[37:53] yeah and she has no idea no idea what's
[37:56] your impression when you walk in the
[37:57] door I you have a picture of the house
[38:00] Mike
[38:03] so I lived out in the country it was in
[38:06] the middle of the cornfield middle of a
[38:07] cornfield in a house built in 1740 and I
[38:11] walked into that kitchen
[38:13] there before my eyes was a Little House
[38:16] on the Prairie
[38:20] and I'm looking around at these people
[38:22] and I'm like what is this
[38:25] now my religious experience is Catholic
[38:29] and Seventh-day Adventist I don't know
[38:32] anything else I have never seen a
[38:34] Pentecostal person in my life
[38:36] so this blows my mind I'm I'm like wow
[38:39] okay
[38:41] that's great but they're nice people
[38:42] they're really nice and I love them
[38:44] right away at this point how many of
[38:47] your siblings are living in the house
[38:51] how many of your siblings are still
[38:53] there well I think only two are gone
[38:55] so it's still a house full yeah at least
[38:57] seven the full Paris experience yeah
[39:01] all the yes all the kids
[39:04] is there anything all the kids
[39:07] is there anything to do with religion
[39:10] that takes place on this trip is there
[39:12] I asked his mom a couple of questions I
[39:15] mean I can't even remember what was said
[39:17] the only thing I remember her saying is
[39:18] she had not cut her hair in 25 years
[39:22] and I said not even a trim and she said
[39:25] no I have not cut my hair 25 years so
[39:27] I'm like wow okay
[39:30] that's it I didn't delve into anything I
[39:32] didn't ask more questions I'm like
[39:34] that's good
[39:40] so lead me up to
[39:43] when questions start getting asked or
[39:45] when you do end up going to a church
[39:46] service or
[39:48] any of that yeah that's a I think that's
[39:50] a long ways it really is well was this
[39:52] the time where they start sending you
[39:54] books yeah yeah my parents started
[39:57] trying to plant Foods yeah so they would
[40:00] send us we'd get we'd get a little
[40:02] package in the mail every once in a
[40:04] while of a only belief magazine
[40:08] and uh
[40:09] well another one would come
[40:12] and another one would come and sprinkled
[40:14] in in an around that would be June 1992
[40:17] so
[40:18] would be the uh a message book here and
[40:21] there would be thrown in a cassette tape
[40:22] now and then have a service of a service
[40:25] and ah I was just like I'd flip through
[40:28] them and then put them in a box
[40:30] another one put it in the Box well then
[40:33] we would move like we would move from
[40:35] North Carolina to Napa and then we would
[40:38] move from Napa to Seattle area and all
[40:41] the while here's the Box
[40:44] and Debbie's like can we just get rid of
[40:47] the Box already I said no the Box comes
[40:50] with us it's just a box just bring the
[40:52] box just bring the box I'm like throw
[40:54] the Box away we don't look at it we
[40:56] don't read anything it like just look
[40:58] can we just throw this away I guess you
[40:59] understood it was religious literature
[41:01] but nothing beyond that I tried to read
[41:03] I tried to read
[41:05] um a message book or two that would come
[41:07] in but I didn't even understand that I
[41:09] was reading a sermon I was trying to
[41:11] read it like a book more and so I'd get
[41:14] a page or so into it and
[41:16] not really understand that I'm reading a
[41:18] sermon right like I had read the
[41:20] footprints on the sands of time when I
[41:22] was a kid so I really loved the stories
[41:25] I really connected at that level
[41:28] so I had a respect
[41:30] for anything that had to do with the
[41:32] message from that point right but it
[41:36] didn't go beyond that but I knew that it
[41:38] was
[41:39] special and I doesn't throw it in the
[41:42] garbage because that would be terrible
[41:44] we may not listen to it or read it but
[41:46] we're not throwing it we're not throwing
[41:47] the garbage
[41:48] that's right box comes with us so y'all
[41:51] move back to Napa yep
[41:54] at some point we moved back to Napa I
[41:56] get a job
[41:58] um working in sales for a packaging
[42:00] company
[42:02] um it's my first introduction to Coffee
[42:03] actually one of my customers was a
[42:05] coffee roaster that led to another
[42:08] transfer up to Seattle where we took a
[42:11] territory covering Oregon Washington
[42:12] British Columbia and Alberta Canada
[42:15] um and that's where I was
[42:18] in the Seattle area where we spent a
[42:20] good number of years so we did skip this
[42:23] and it's okay we don't have to shove
[42:24] into it but at some point I mean you're
[42:27] six years up you said I'm done with the
[42:29] Marines yeah and it was for the sake of
[42:31] family yeah yeah Debbie had a lot to do
[42:34] with that I I did see what the
[42:35] lieutenant colonel was saying about a
[42:37] thousand people make the wrong choice I
[42:39] was starting to see that that was real
[42:41] but the wrong choice was the Marines
[42:43] correct for me staying in would have
[42:45] been the wrong choice for our family so
[42:48] you go into sales you live in the
[42:50] Seattle area
[42:51] and at some point and if I skip too far
[42:54] here stop me y'all go back for a family
[42:56] reunion yeah
[42:58] Yeah it's gotten to be about uh 2002.
[43:03] we're in Seattle for about four years at
[43:06] this point yeah we've tried to like
[43:09] we've had Rebecca at this point in one
[43:11] two yeah yeah so I got out of the
[43:14] military in 1996. Okay so
[43:18] we kind of flashed over a couple of
[43:20] years there but Rebecca was born in in
[43:22] 97.
[43:24] while we were in Seattle or the first
[43:26] year we were in Seattle and
[43:29] um
[43:31] we tried we tried to try Church
[43:34] she wanted to raise Rebecca in a
[43:36] Christian home and I have this concept
[43:39] of what a church service should be like
[43:42] in-house quite closely resembled a house
[43:46] so and I would any time we went to a
[43:49] church that had stained glass windows
[43:51] I'm already on my heels and I would ask
[43:54] Derek periodically over the years I
[43:56] wouldn't push too much but I would try
[43:59] to understand like I needed a
[44:01] denominational name like what is this
[44:05] what do you believe what were you raised
[44:07] you know give me a name and he couldn't
[44:10] give me a name he would say the spoken
[44:12] word the message of the hour and
[44:15] I don't get this
[44:16] I need a name neither did he not
[44:19] honestly he didn't get it either no
[44:21] that's right so yeah was it during this
[44:24] time that you're trying to buy a house
[44:26] yeah that's a great story you got to
[44:28] share that story yeah so we're trying to
[44:30] buy our first home and I'm out of the
[44:32] military so you qualify for certain
[44:34] benefits and and I find this mortgage
[44:36] company that has all of this you know
[44:39] portfolio that all they offer
[44:42] um VA things and it's uniquely called
[44:45] Eagle Mortgage so I was attracted to
[44:47] that you know Eagles you know that was
[44:49] that was pretty cool
[44:51] um
[44:52] and somewhere along the line of of
[44:55] meeting with him and talking to him it
[44:56] turns out he's a message believer and
[44:59] invites us to church at his house
[45:02] perfect it yeah I mean I thought this
[45:07] was a this was a we're going to have our
[45:09] house we're going to be able to go to
[45:11] church it's and it's in a house and he
[45:13] has the only belief songbooks and he
[45:15] plays a guitar and preaches like that's
[45:18] exactly what I remember from being a kid
[45:20] but something just didn't click and I
[45:24] couldn't put my finger on it and I don't
[45:25] think Debbie could either but it was
[45:28] almost like a feeling of US foreign no
[45:31] more kind of there wasn't really a
[45:34] spirit of
[45:35] I don't know how to explain it but at
[45:37] that point I was like it feels a little
[45:40] weird and there probably was only about
[45:42] four of you
[45:43] yeah maybe maybe with if both of his
[45:46] other kids showed up
[45:48] we could explain it now we couldn't
[45:50] explain it then but there was no life
[45:52] right yeah there just wasn't any life to
[45:55] back it up yes so we weren't attracted
[45:57] to it
[45:59] so that I say that cost us about two
[46:02] years because that was into late 1999 to
[46:04] 2000. so you go to that church yeah
[46:06] service or one or two times a couple of
[46:08] times and then after that the years
[46:10] without it again yeah until we go to
[46:12] Maryland to a family reunion
[46:15] so in 2002 take it from there yeah do
[46:18] you want to tell that
[46:20] yeah
[46:21] do I
[46:23] so in 2002 my my parents organized my
[46:27] siblings organized this family reunion
[46:29] so there's going to be all nine kids and
[46:32] significant others so it takes a pretty
[46:34] good size beach house to get everybody
[46:36] coordinated to come together and so
[46:39] we're all there and I don't know we
[46:41] spend two or three nights there but the
[46:44] weekend comes along and anytime you go
[46:47] to Mom and Dad's house it's you know you
[46:50] know you don't spend the night Saturday
[46:52] night and be there on Sunday morning
[46:54] because you're going to church or you're
[46:56] going to get asked you're going to get
[46:57] asked anybody they didn't make anybody
[47:00] go to church but some felt more
[47:02] obligated than others and I didn't feel
[47:04] obligated I just you know we're just not
[47:07] going to church until somebody pipes up
[47:10] on Saturday night we're all sitting
[47:12] around drinking having a good time and
[47:19] and wine coolers we're drinking one my
[47:21] mom says
[47:22] so who's going to church with me and
[47:25] Bruce in the morning and uh
[47:28] we will I'm like we
[47:32] literally raised my hand we'll go
[47:35] so you were excited
[47:38] I wasn't excited but I don't know what
[47:40] she's going through because at this time
[47:42] Debbie's kind of been you know you've
[47:45] had
[47:45] uh Y2K you've had uh 911 the Twin Towers
[47:51] have fallen like so she's going she's
[47:53] had a baby so she's going through things
[47:55] that I'm not going through she's reading
[47:57] the Left Behind series
[47:59] she's been raised in the in the
[48:02] Seventh-day Adventist where they teach
[48:03] you to go through the tribulation
[48:05] right um that's just part of their
[48:08] protocol so there's something in your
[48:09] heart that is stirring for something I
[48:12] mean there's
[48:13] yeah I'm I'm on depression medicine
[48:17] um every day I'm on anxiety medicine as
[48:21] I have panic attacks
[48:23] so um and I read the Left Behind series
[48:26] and I'm
[48:29] like you said God Bless yeah
[48:33] I know I'm unsaved but I don't know how
[48:35] to be saved and so this is just an
[48:37] opportunity to go to church it is you're
[48:39] all about it I am yeah so how's that
[48:41] service go
[48:42] you know that's so this is in Delaware
[48:45] and uh it's a small small Church like a
[48:48] metal frame building and maybe 30 40
[48:52] people are there
[48:54] the guy preaching I actually had grown
[48:56] up with as a kid so I relaxed instantly
[48:59] um it's a message church and
[49:02] we're sitting all the way in the back so
[49:04] Rebecca's maybe four and a half years
[49:06] old at the time and
[49:09] we're just sitting there and listening
[49:11] and it's a good service and all of a
[49:14] sudden I'm noticing that I'm crying
[49:17] and um
[49:18] feeling any emotion
[49:20] but tears are running down my face
[49:23] so I grab her back and put her on my lap
[49:25] and I'm like trying to hide behind her
[49:27] I wouldn't want anybody else to see this
[49:30] weird reaction that's happening and I
[49:33] have nothing no butterflies no
[49:35] excitement I'm crying and it's getting
[49:39] worse I'm not sobbing like a like you'd
[49:42] say you're crying like that I'm just I'm
[49:45] starting to snot so now I'm like wipe my
[49:48] nose on Rebecca's blanket
[49:50] [Music]
[49:50] [Applause]
[49:51] this is really strange I mean
[49:55] this is really strange
[49:58] I don't know what's happening so they
[50:00] dismissed the service they sing a song
[50:02] and everybody gets up and I'm gone I get
[50:06] in the car as quick as I could we drove
[50:09] separately from my mom and dad
[50:11] I got in and closed the door I was like
[50:13] whatever just happened in there I don't
[50:16] know what that was but that that was
[50:18] really weird like I didn't expect
[50:20] anything like that and I've never had
[50:22] that happen before and immediately I
[50:24] wanted to withdraw
[50:26] I wanted to get a get away
[50:30] um
[50:30] I was affected in the service enough
[50:33] that
[50:35] I'm hearing things that are kind of
[50:37] questions that I had
[50:39] so I it uh it made me go hmm
[50:43] maybe there's more to this like I want I
[50:46] want to know more you're finally getting
[50:47] a little bit of a window into
[50:49] what he believed all his years yes or
[50:53] what he so I've got to go back to work
[50:54] thankfully I mean
[50:57] long ways away three thousand miles so
[51:00] I'm going back to Seattle so I catch a
[51:01] flight I think the next day and Debbie
[51:04] and Rebecca are going to stay with
[51:06] Grandma and Grandpa for another week for
[51:08] another week so so I asked Grandma
[51:11] um
[51:12] so where like how can I find a church
[51:15] that's near us
[51:16] and she says well there is a church in
[51:19] Canada
[51:20] and I said great that's three hours
[51:23] north of us I need something like in
[51:26] Seattle right she said well reach out to
[51:29] them and maybe they can help you find
[51:31] something that's close to you so I do I
[51:34] send an email to Cloverdale
[51:36] and I get an email back pretty much
[51:39] immediately because I send this email on
[51:42] Monday and they tell me that they have
[51:44] Outreach meetings in Seattle once a
[51:47] month on a Friday
[51:49] that's great and the next one's like a
[51:51] month away because I guess they had just
[51:53] had one
[51:54] so that would put us to the end of June
[51:58] when we went for that now are you
[52:02] willingly going to this oh it's a month
[52:05] away I say sure
[52:07] sure a lot can happen in a month
[52:10] she might forget
[52:14] she didn't forget no she didn't forget
[52:16] no I was excitingly waited for waiting
[52:18] for that month I tried to work late that
[52:20] day I tried to come up with every excuse
[52:22] why I couldn't get home
[52:24] finally she calls me and it was like
[52:26] death if you don't get to the house
[52:28] right now matter of fact you don't even
[52:30] have time to come home meet me halfway
[52:32] so we had to meet at a Red Robin and
[52:34] leave my car and I had to get in her car
[52:36] but by then okay it's fine we're gonna
[52:39] go to church it's Friday night we didn't
[52:41] have anything else to do anyway it's
[52:43] gonna be fine
[52:45] so we drive through these neighborhoods
[52:47] and you get to an industrial park and
[52:49] then South Tacoma yeah Tacoma it's not
[52:52] like the nicest area no so I we have an
[52:56] address and that's all we have we don't
[52:57] know if it's a big stained glass window
[53:00] church or if we're back to house
[53:02] meetings it's pre-gps are you Matt
[53:04] questioning it MapQuest paper
[53:07] happy
[53:09] but we get we we get to a place that
[53:12] matches this the address and it's a
[53:13] house
[53:14] so we walked through the door and
[53:17] there's folding chairs set up in the
[53:19] living room there's only belief song
[53:21] books on the chairs I relax this is
[53:23] comfortable to me
[53:26] he says Yep this is it this is it oh
[53:28] this is it
[53:30] it's a house it's a house again so we we
[53:33] know Martin Wallman here pretty well
[53:35] right Martin comes over it's his wife's
[53:38] parents house okay okay so there you
[53:42] cranian Russian they're Russian not
[53:45] Ukrainian I knew that sorry Deanna
[53:49] their mom really loved Ivy the kind that
[53:52] grows across the ceiling if you put
[53:54] fishing line
[53:55] so the whole ceiling is covered with ivy
[53:57] looks amazing so like plants yeah so you
[54:01] walk in and everything's ivy for her
[54:04] it's not relaxing no to me this is fine
[54:07] I pick up the only belief song book and
[54:10] I'm oh I remember that song childhood
[54:12] memories yeah start coming back so I'm
[54:14] pretty relaxed
[54:16] um
[54:16] yeah
[54:17] until until the guy gets up to start
[54:20] speaking
[54:22] in Russian
[54:26] now all of a sudden it doesn't make
[54:27] sense
[54:28] we're in the wrong place
[54:30] so
[54:32] the Centurion simple believer I figure
[54:35] I'm a simple believer so I just bowed my
[54:37] head and I said I'm not a Believer at
[54:39] this point that I know of and I say God
[54:43] if I'm where I'm supposed to be
[54:45] if I brought my family where you want me
[54:48] I need to hear like you made it possible
[54:50] on the day of panic cost I need to hear
[54:53] my own language Peter ivanenko
[54:55] becomes and he starts interpreting for
[54:57] brother Mahmoud okay I relax again
[55:01] prayer answered yeah so that's you know
[55:03] a check in the right box so I'm relaxed
[55:06] again and a few 20 30 minutes later
[55:09] they're not always on time
[55:12] um the folks from Cloverdale the
[55:15] Outreach team rolled in John Andes and a
[55:19] bunch of sisters Calista and Margaret
[55:21] they would all came in and oh the
[55:24] atmosphere was all of a sudden on fire
[55:27] like singing and just worshiping the
[55:30] Lord and oh this was totally different
[55:32] from what I remembered growing up
[55:34] and this guy gets up and he starts
[55:37] preaching and I mean we're talking
[55:39] preaching and all of a sudden I realize
[55:42] I'm hearing the same service I heard a
[55:46] month ago the same scripture the same
[55:49] references and I'm having the same
[55:51] reaction this time I realize it's God
[55:55] and I realized I'd missed it before and
[55:58] um I'm not panicking
[56:00] but I'm so excited that God's actually
[56:05] speaking to me yeah
[56:06] I'm I'm so excited I'm throwing in the
[56:10] towel like it's over I'm gonna serve God
[56:14] and it's going to cost me my family I'm
[56:16] gonna serve God and I don't know where
[56:18] I'm gonna live but God's dealing with my
[56:21] heart and I that night I totally
[56:25] surrendered
[56:27] um I knew Debbie wouldn't accept it her
[56:30] just her whole demeanor of being in the
[56:33] space was the ivy on the roof yeah it
[56:36] just wasn't working
[56:38] you're the one that pushed for this I
[56:41] was backpedaling so hard and I'm just
[56:45] like what have I done I forced this what
[56:49] have I done
[56:50] this was terrible so it's awesome
[56:54] it's obvious to everyone I mean in this
[56:56] moment that it's happening yeah brother
[56:59] John Andy said I was just like a light
[57:01] bulb just totally lit up so I'm shaking
[57:04] his hand and wherever Cloverdale is
[57:07] be there on Sunday morning and I'm out
[57:11] the door and get in the car and close
[57:13] the door and I just I'm just singing
[57:15] inside and I hear this
[57:18] on the other side
[57:20] and at the moment I said in my heart
[57:23] I've lost Debbie
[57:25] but it's gonna be okay and that could
[57:27] tell I said you may be going to
[57:30] Cloverdale on Sunday but I'm not
[57:33] and I said
[57:34] that's okay me and Rebecca go it'll be
[57:37] fine
[57:38] and I just had the thought in my head
[57:39] yeah right you're taking my child to
[57:41] Canada
[57:42] I didn't say that out loud
[57:45] I needed a bargaining chip on my side so
[57:49] I'm taking Rebecca yeah I am completely
[57:52] running the opposite direction and he is
[57:54] completely surrendered so this starts uh
[57:56] this starts a chain of what you would
[57:59] call Supernatural events
[58:03] um I go home that night and I'm happily
[58:06] reading my Bible I'm reading it like
[58:09] it's brand new like I've like are you
[58:12] kidding me this is really what it says
[58:14] and so I I stay on the couch that night
[58:18] in the living room and sometimes I sleep
[58:20] sometimes I pray sometimes I read and
[58:23] not really concerned that
[58:26] my other half is unhappy upstairs
[58:30] gone to bed yeah I'm laying in the bed
[58:32] still going what have I done I'm seeing
[58:35] my life pass before my eyes now the TV's
[58:38] got to go out now I've got to put on a
[58:40] skirt all the time now you know like all
[58:42] this list of all these things I've got
[58:43] to do just by seeing observing Derek's
[58:46] family and knowing how they live Little
[58:49] House on the Prairie Little House on the
[58:50] Prairie coming to your house yes and now
[58:54] I've got to do that yeah
[58:56] so I wake up the next morning and he's
[58:59] still down on the couch and he's reading
[59:02] the Bible
[59:05] what have I done
[59:07] and I go into our office upstairs and I
[59:12] am still searching and I do still want
[59:15] the truth
[59:16] so I just bow my head right there in the
[59:19] office and I say Lord if this is the
[59:22] truth you need to let me know
[59:25] and he said right back to me just follow
[59:28] your husband
[59:31] okay
[59:33] like this huge weight came off me
[59:35] because suddenly I didn't have to put on
[59:37] a skirt I didn't have to throw out the
[59:38] TV I didn't I didn't have to do anything
[59:40] just go
[59:42] just go with him he's not asking me to
[59:44] do anything just go right okay
[59:47] so I get up from that prayer and I lean
[59:50] over the railing and I said okay we'll
[59:52] come with you on Sunday
[59:54] hey I was happy and I I got a traveling
[59:58] Companion now you got to remember I'm
[1:00:00] practical yeah he he didn't want to say
[1:00:02] anything to mess it up so he was just

[1:00:28] not really realizing that
[1:00:31] God's about to change your life right
[1:00:33] for real you're in it for a holiday and
[1:00:36] the Lord says keep coming
[1:00:39] so we get
[1:00:40] we we drive up so
[1:00:43] our first service was on a Friday night
[1:00:45] Sunday morning arrives we head off to
[1:00:47] Canada
[1:00:48] and it we're still MapQuest days that's
[1:00:51] right nothing's changed there we have a
[1:00:53] paper map with an address we printed it
[1:00:55] out on our computer and we pull up to
[1:00:58] the Canadian border and we've got all of
[1:00:59] our documents and who's in the car in
[1:01:02] front of us
[1:01:11] Brother John
[1:01:14] brother John follow me follow me
[1:01:18] [Music]
[1:01:19] so we followed brother John to church we
[1:01:21] threw away MapQuest and
[1:01:24] never looked at it so great because
[1:01:25] we're driving into another country and
[1:01:27] we don't know where we are or where
[1:01:28] we're going and it just took every every
[1:01:31] worry off
[1:01:33] so we our first service
[1:01:36] we look like the world
[1:01:39] you got to remember we don't look like
[1:01:40] this
[1:01:41] we walk in and sit down and pre-service
[1:01:44] music is playing we're crying
[1:01:47] this atmosphere is amazing
[1:01:49] they start singing we're crying even
[1:01:52] worse and now we're looking around at
[1:01:54] the people smiling and clapping their
[1:01:56] hands
[1:01:57] they've been here so long they've become
[1:01:59] formal
[1:02:01] any different look at us we don't even
[1:02:05] feel this atmosphere that we're feeling
[1:02:07] oh we didn't know that we couldn't
[1:02:09] figure out why they weren't crying
[1:02:10] starting to wash you right they've been
[1:02:12] washed
[1:02:13] we didn't know that
[1:02:15] so we cry the whole first service and as
[1:02:19] the as the service comes to an end I
[1:02:21] brother biscoe's preaching it
[1:02:24] I remember having this fleeting thought
[1:02:28] of what if you've picked the wrong
[1:02:30] Church
[1:02:33] great
[1:02:35] here I sit amongst people that appear to
[1:02:38] be pretty nice they look good
[1:02:41] the preaching sounded good but how do I
[1:02:43] know
[1:02:45] well okay
[1:02:47] the Pentecost thing worked so I better
[1:02:49] pray
[1:02:50] so I bow my head and I pray and I'm like
[1:02:53] God I don't even know what to ask you
[1:02:55] for
[1:02:57] the only thing I can think of is like if
[1:03:00] you could have because I don't know
[1:03:02] brother Edge brother Ed or brother
[1:03:03] Biscoe I just said the man preaching if
[1:03:06] you could have him tell this relate the
[1:03:09] story of the man from Chicago I don't
[1:03:11] even know the story but he sent his son
[1:03:14] out west to
[1:03:16] find a wife and
[1:03:20] the stories from childhood
[1:03:22] I've read the
[1:03:25] footprints on the sands of time so
[1:03:27] that's the only thing I can put my
[1:03:29] finger on and say I remember that if he
[1:03:32] could tell that story the service
[1:03:33] finishes and he walks away
[1:03:35] closes this Bible and walks back towards
[1:03:38] this chair
[1:03:39] and my heart sinks because now I'm like
[1:03:41] I've got to deal with the reality that
[1:03:43] I've just asked for something and either
[1:03:46] God didn't answer or he answered
[1:03:51] brother it turns on his heel and comes
[1:03:53] back to the podium and tells the story
[1:03:56] verbatim like every detail
[1:03:59] of the event
[1:04:02] so I'm crying all over again I'm so
[1:04:05] happy because now I know that I'm where
[1:04:07] I'm supposed to be right
[1:04:09] and we leave the service and actually
[1:04:13] ask to meet with brother Ed and explain
[1:04:15] to him who we are I know we look like
[1:04:17] we're right out of the world we are and
[1:04:19] he doesn't he's very gracious the
[1:04:22] interesting thing is
[1:04:24] Derek is a military background
[1:04:26] so he has a very orderly way of doing
[1:04:30] things
[1:04:31] and kind of like the Centurion or saying
[1:04:34] like I know what power you have Jesus
[1:04:37] you just say the word and this will
[1:04:39] happen and so he kind of approaches
[1:04:41] brother Ed in that way and he asked to
[1:04:46] attend his church
[1:04:47] I don't want to just come here and just
[1:04:49] like show up like I want you to know I'm
[1:04:51] serious
[1:04:53] I want to be baptized I want to attend
[1:04:56] your church and I'm serious yeah I'm not
[1:04:58] going to be a fly by night in out half
[1:05:01] in the world we're here we're here
[1:05:04] we're committed
[1:05:07] for you committed
[1:05:09] I was more committed
[1:05:11] yes but I still have questions I have
[1:05:13] kind of the same question not is this
[1:05:16] church okay but
[1:05:18] is this the truth
[1:05:20] because I've seen Catholic
[1:05:23] I've seen Seventh-Day Adventists
[1:05:27] but I know neither of them really had
[1:05:28] the truth
[1:05:30] they had partials and I wanted to know
[1:05:33] that it was the truth
[1:05:35] so you leave there
[1:05:37] you gotta get baptized I'm getting I'm
[1:05:41] getting baptized the next Sunday
[1:05:43] so spoke to brother Ed and he said
[1:05:45] that's fine you can get
[1:05:49] so my days set next week so take us
[1:05:52] through that yeah so we come up
[1:05:56] the Saturday before they're having a
[1:05:58] fellowship I can't remember whose house
[1:05:59] but they had a fellowship a bunch of
[1:06:02] people came over and so we're just kind
[1:06:04] of mingling and I'm hanging out with
[1:06:06] some of the brothers and Debbie is
[1:06:08] hanging out with some of the sisters
[1:06:09] actually
[1:06:11] so I'm sitting off in the chair just
[1:06:14] kind of watching everybody just kind of
[1:06:16] taking everything in
[1:06:18] and this lady just comes up to me
[1:06:20] so when are you getting baptized
[1:06:25] you know where is Kathy Morgan
[1:06:35] say
[1:06:36] uh I don't know I know I should
[1:06:41] say that's the night before you're
[1:06:43] getting baptized yeah that's the night
[1:06:45] before so we get to spend the night with
[1:06:48] um a very nice couple Mike and Debbie
[1:06:50] gagne brother Ed said that he put us
[1:06:53] together because we were so so much
[1:06:55] alike
[1:06:57] um
[1:06:58] so we got to spend the night with them
[1:06:59] and we just sat around for a couple of
[1:07:01] hours actually before we went to bed and
[1:07:03] visited about the scriptures and brother
[1:07:06] Mike is is a phenomenal
[1:07:08] um student of the scriptures his Sunday
[1:07:10] school teacher so he's very patient and
[1:07:13] able to go through different scriptures
[1:07:15] with us and we kind of came up
[1:07:17] came across talking about a fleece and
[1:07:20] um
[1:07:21] and explained it to Debbie in a way that
[1:07:24] she
[1:07:25] grasped it to the level where hey maybe
[1:07:29] I need to ask the Lord for a fleece so
[1:07:32] that night you know I'm getting baptized
[1:07:34] in the morning so brother Mike has two
[1:07:37] separate rooms so I have a room to
[1:07:40] myself so I'm able to go and pray and as
[1:07:42] much as I'd like to and not be disturbed
[1:07:44] or Not Disturb anybody during the night
[1:07:47] and Debbie got to think that night so
[1:07:51] I'm sleeping in the other room with
[1:07:53] Rebecca and Rebecca has gone to sleep
[1:07:55] and I'm just laying there
[1:07:58] so when are you getting baptized
[1:08:01] ties
[1:08:01] thinking about that
[1:08:04] I was like no like
[1:08:05] what am I so I'm praying and
[1:08:09] now here I am laying in this bed
[1:08:12] and I am going to ask
[1:08:16] the god of creation
[1:08:20] to give me a fleece who am I I'm a worm
[1:08:24] this is what I'm telling him I'm a worm
[1:08:27] I'm nothing and I'm going to ask you for
[1:08:29] a fleece Lord I'm not worthy
[1:08:31] I don't know what to ask you
[1:08:35] but would you please just show me
[1:08:36] something
[1:08:38] and that's that's how I leave it so I
[1:08:40] don't ask for a specific thing
[1:08:42] but I just humble myself and
[1:08:48] so we go to church that morning we get
[1:08:50] up and uh and head off to church and
[1:08:53] we're driving our vehicle and Mike and
[1:08:54] Debbie are driving there's we're
[1:08:55] mapquesting it so
[1:08:57] you take this turn and when you get
[1:08:59] there you take that turn and we're in
[1:09:01] the car we're in the car go ahead and
[1:09:02] drive uh I'm driving
[1:09:06] and I'm watching this
[1:09:09] look at her Bible now I've driven
[1:09:11] thousands of miles with this girl who
[1:09:13] gets sick if you hand her a map you
[1:09:15] could be lost in Chicago
[1:09:17] you could be lost anywhere if you hand
[1:09:19] her a map to try and get help
[1:09:21] she gets sick and I'm like what is she
[1:09:24] doing why is she reading she's going to
[1:09:27] get sick great we're going to get to
[1:09:28] church and she's going to be sick and
[1:09:30] have to sit in the car on your day on my
[1:09:33] day she's gonna miss it
[1:09:34] [Applause]
[1:09:36] this is just working out great so I'm
[1:09:39] not really excited but it doesn't say
[1:09:41] anything because she's reading the Bible
[1:09:43] so I don't get sick which is a near
[1:09:46] miracle in itself and and God could have
[1:09:49] left it at that really but it didn't
[1:09:50] even dawn on me that I didn't get sick
[1:09:52] but I didn't get sick for some reason I
[1:09:55] had the Book of Life on my mind
[1:09:57] so I mean I've got a little bit of a
[1:09:59] religious background so I know some
[1:10:02] words some things and I thought of the
[1:10:04] book of life and so I just am looking in
[1:10:07] the back concordance and okay where does
[1:10:10] it talk about that in the Bible and I'm
[1:10:11] going back and forth and I'm I'm trying
[1:10:13] to find
[1:10:15] um the part in Philippians where it
[1:10:18] mentions the book of life and it's uh I
[1:10:22] go back and
[1:10:24] and I keep going to the wrong scripture
[1:10:26] three times in a row I go to Philippians
[1:10:29] 4 8. finally Brethren whatsoever things
[1:10:32] are true whatsoever things are honest
[1:10:34] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[1:10:37] things are pure whatsoever things are
[1:10:39] lovely whatsoever things are of a good
[1:10:41] report if there be any virtue if there
[1:10:43] be any praise think on these things
[1:10:46] it doesn't say anything about the Book
[1:10:47] of Life
[1:10:49] finally I find it it's actually
[1:10:51] Philippians 4 3 where it's mentioned and
[1:10:54] that's when I close the Bible I'm like
[1:10:55] okay finally found it that's what I was
[1:10:58] looking for okay
[1:11:00] done so I put the Bible down and we get
[1:11:03] to church about 15 minutes later
[1:11:05] and I'm not sick
[1:11:07] not sick
[1:11:08] same atmosphere we're crying it's
[1:11:11] awesome
[1:11:13] it's great
[1:11:14] um brother Ed comes up and and
[1:11:18] takes the pulpit says open the
[1:11:20] scriptures
[1:11:22] to Philippians 4 8.
[1:11:25] and I've got my Bible and I say
[1:11:30] and out the door I go
[1:11:32] on my day
[1:11:34] I'm disturbing his day I don't know
[1:11:37] what's happened but this isn't good
[1:11:41] she just walked out he barely read the
[1:11:42] scriptures
[1:11:44] and a few minutes later she comes
[1:11:46] bustling back in and
[1:11:49] it's my day I'm really trying to pay
[1:11:52] attention in this traffic and then I get
[1:11:55] a tap on my shoulder and one of the
[1:11:58] deacons I'm like really yeah
[1:12:00] he hands me a note
[1:12:01] so it's for sister Debbie so okay so I'm
[1:12:04] now I'm handing notes in church
[1:12:08] we definitely didn't do that in the home
[1:12:10] Church no that was not so I opened the
[1:12:12] note the note says sister Debbie didn't
[1:12:14] realize that you were brother Derek's
[1:12:16] wife yes it would be fine if you got
[1:12:17] baptized today
[1:12:19] so then I have to read the note because
[1:12:21] she hands it to me to read so then I
[1:12:23] read now I'm happy no we're about so
[1:12:25] when you left you went to find somebody
[1:12:27] to tell me you won't get baptized yeah I
[1:12:29] was gonna find anybody somebody so the
[1:12:32] man that was just song Waiting is coming
[1:12:34] around the the uh the foyer and I see
[1:12:39] him and I'm like he was just up there he
[1:12:41] must be good so like a good person to
[1:12:45] talk to so I go up to him and actually
[1:12:47] lay hands on his lapels of his coat and
[1:12:50] I'm crying and I said I have to be
[1:12:52] baptized today
[1:12:54] and he's like okay sister we'll get you
[1:12:57] taken care of just calm down like we'll
[1:13:00] get you'll it'll be fine
[1:13:02] so okay and then I go back inside so
[1:13:06] your day became y'all's day my day
[1:13:08] became our day and I got her back
[1:13:13] so y'all are baptized in what year
[1:13:16] this is 2002 July 11th
[1:13:20] so we've come from meeting in a in a bar
[1:13:23] in Napa which the odds of you even being
[1:13:27] there is
[1:13:29] so now we are
[1:13:32] in Canada being baptized together yeah
[1:13:36] yeah God's going to get you
[1:13:38] no matter where you are yeah
[1:13:40] he's gonna find you he's going to bring
[1:13:42] you where he wants you know and I just I
[1:13:45] love I love how he just in his own way
[1:13:48] as it related to what you needed and
[1:13:50] what you needed yeah
[1:13:52] would reveal the truth to you you know
[1:13:55] he speaks to us all in different ways
[1:13:56] and he did it in a way that you needed
[1:13:59] it so y'all get baptized together
[1:14:02] and we're gonna go to this next part
[1:14:03] quickly but y'all are all in we're all
[1:14:06] in you're all in so this is two thousand
[1:14:09] you just told me but 2002 you said or
[1:14:10] three two thousand two thousand two
[1:14:12] we're 31 years old
[1:14:15] yeah at this point so brother John and I
[1:14:18] connect really quick he actually prayed
[1:14:20] with me that that first service at the
[1:14:23] end of the service for I don't know 45
[1:14:25] minutes or an hour
[1:14:27] um so we connected really really well
[1:14:30] and
[1:14:32] um so they would have the Outreach
[1:14:33] meetings every month
[1:14:35] down in in the Tacoma area and so I
[1:14:39] helped you know
[1:14:41] came right along with helping arrange
[1:14:43] the meetings we decided that having a
[1:14:46] house meeting with ivy on the ceiling
[1:14:49] maybe not attractive to newcomers that
[1:14:51] might not be used to this worked for me
[1:14:53] didn't necessarily uh help for sister
[1:14:56] Debbie so maybe we could get a building
[1:14:58] where we could have meetings so
[1:15:00] um very early on we got into the
[1:15:02] logistics of of getting a building
[1:15:05] setting it up every on the Friday nights
[1:15:08] we went to Friday nights every week
[1:15:11] right away so I I don't know it was
[1:15:14] probably two or three months in
[1:15:16] brother John said I think Eugene was
[1:15:18] leading songs brother John said
[1:15:21] um
[1:15:21] can you sing I said well I've ever
[1:15:24] picked songs
[1:15:27] pick songs for other people yeah
[1:15:29] yeah I can I can lead songs so I started
[1:15:32] leading songs pretty much right away at
[1:15:35] the on the Friday night services yeah
[1:15:37] the Outreach meetings so immediately
[1:15:39] involved and then you also began to work
[1:15:41] in in missions as well yeah within a
[1:15:43] couple of years
[1:15:45] um it was actually
[1:15:47] uh after uh I think it was a school
[1:15:50] Christmas concert that we had for Beast
[1:15:54] for Bible Christian Academy
[1:15:56] um I was doing the Because I've been
[1:15:58] leading Songs in Seattle
[1:15:59] I did the MC for the school where it was
[1:16:03] Rebecca was in the school at this point
[1:16:05] because we moved up to Birch Bay and uh
[1:16:09] I asked brother Ed to come up and open
[1:16:10] in prayer and he said well we've been
[1:16:13] looking for a new song leader and I'd
[1:16:16] like to introduce you to Our Lady some
[1:16:17] new our newest song leader
[1:16:19] so that's how I became the song leader
[1:16:21] in Cloverdale was at a Christmas concert
[1:16:27] I didn't see that one coming no that
[1:16:30] caught me off guard now so go ahead so
[1:16:32] he so from from there it was about three
[1:16:35] years
[1:16:36] um I started working in missions
[1:16:38] full-time
[1:16:39] so right along I think brother Tony
[1:16:42] admin at the time and then I was the
[1:16:44] missions director until Kim dingwal took
[1:16:47] over now a lot of people here I say a
[1:16:49] lot of people quite a few knew from
[1:16:51] working at the camp yeah up there what
[1:16:54] year does that take place so that takes
[1:16:55] place in 2009
[1:16:58] yeah David's uh 18 months old at this
[1:17:01] point we've come through his miraculous
[1:17:03] healing and uh
[1:17:06] and
[1:17:07] the kids are really little Rebecca's
[1:17:09] like maybe 11 11 at the time so we get
[1:17:13] asked to go out to the camp and kind of
[1:17:15] be security so
[1:17:17] a lot of people's recollection of the
[1:17:19] campus kind of brother Ron's tied to
[1:17:21] brother Ron Spencer I I think most most
[1:17:24] folks know that brother Ed called him
[1:17:26] and said you'll be our first speaker
[1:17:28] right we've just bought Mount Baker camp
[1:17:30] so he speaks that fall and then the next
[1:17:34] summer where we go out to the camp to
[1:17:37] look after it for the summer and at the
[1:17:39] end of the summer I asked him because I
[1:17:41] think brother John lay had started to
[1:17:43] come back down here
[1:17:45] because he was helping out a lot at that
[1:17:47] time and carrying the Lion's Share the
[1:17:48] of the workload there and um
[1:17:52] as it came to be August I said who's the
[1:17:55] who's the new crew me and my family are
[1:17:57] going back to Birch Bay and they said oh
[1:18:00] well we haven't been looking for anybody
[1:18:03] I said that's pretty sneaky
[1:18:06] so you're just gonna leave us right here
[1:18:08] so yes yeah that became a big part of
[1:18:11] your life and how long did y'all we
[1:18:13] stayed there 0-9 till
[1:18:16] um we lived on the grounds for eight
[1:18:17] years we ran it for 10.
[1:18:21] now one thing that I didn't realize
[1:18:23] until they got here we had conversations
[1:18:25] is I always thought of the campus like a
[1:18:27] message Camp you know that that's just a
[1:18:30] couple times a year there was but this
[1:18:32] was 365. yeah all kind of different
[1:18:35] groups using this camp and y'all were
[1:18:38] running it
[1:18:39] give us just briefly the the scope and
[1:18:42] size of what y'all were doing yeah so we
[1:18:44] had a 40 acre Camp uh 35 buildings
[1:18:48] Debbie was the head chef I was the sales
[1:18:51] operations and Logistics and the kids
[1:18:54] were in supporting roles as they grew up
[1:18:58] um we cooked on average 23 000 meals a
[1:19:02] year
[1:19:03] I didn't cook often I did I did burgers
[1:19:06] in one of those somebody quit the
[1:19:08] picture of David cooking I mean cooking
[1:19:11] he's in trouble our average group look
[1:19:14] at that
[1:19:16] our average group size was 125 campers
[1:19:19] but we did have groups like when
[1:19:22] Cloverdale would come up to like 400
[1:19:24] when it was really big of course there
[1:19:25] was a lot more people helping for that
[1:19:27] so we served 10 000 campers a year so it
[1:19:30] was a pretty busy operation we were most
[1:19:32] days most weeks y'all were there running
[1:19:34] yeah I
[1:19:37] I really subscribed to
[1:19:39] God can give you inspiration beyond what
[1:19:42] your
[1:19:44] in your normal scope of understanding
[1:19:46] what you're able to do and one of those
[1:19:47] instances
[1:19:49] um I didn't share with you the other
[1:19:50] night was
[1:19:52] we got the opportunity to build a sport
[1:19:54] court and it's on the side of a mountain
[1:19:57] so there's not a lot of level areas to
[1:19:59] play so having a basketball court would
[1:20:02] be awesome
[1:20:03] so I got some funding kind of squirreled
[1:20:05] away and brother Ed was able to pitch in
[1:20:08] on another large portion of it and then
[1:20:11] I got a concrete company to commit to a
[1:20:13] portion of it so I I get a guy with a
[1:20:16] bulldozer and an excavator to kind of
[1:20:18] level out a spot
[1:20:20] and he leaves for the weekend and we're
[1:20:23] supposed to pour concrete on Tuesday
[1:20:26] he's not coming back on Monday I think
[1:20:28] it's Memorial Day weekend
[1:20:29] and uh
[1:20:31] the the concrete company stops by on
[1:20:34] Friday
[1:20:35] and he's gonna I don't know if you know
[1:20:37] the term shoot grade I don't know what
[1:20:39] shoot and grade is and he's going to
[1:20:41] take the highest point in the lowest
[1:20:43] point and see what the differential is
[1:20:44] it's nine inches I said well that's not
[1:20:47] bad right he said well it's going to
[1:20:49] cost you a lot of money probably an
[1:20:50] extra truckload of concrete the sport
[1:20:52] Court's going to be 125 feet long and 50
[1:20:55] feet wide
[1:20:56] and I'm panicking because an extra
[1:21:00] truckload or two sounds excessive
[1:21:03] I don't know
[1:21:04] couple five six thousand dollars of
[1:21:07] concrete
[1:21:08] so I'm I'm really burdened and and under
[1:21:12] the strain of I don't know how to make
[1:21:14] this happen before Monday before Tuesday
[1:21:17] because the concrete guys coming and
[1:21:20] that contractor with the excavator has
[1:21:23] left
[1:21:25] so I get in the van and I drive to
[1:21:27] Bellingham I didn't send you a picture
[1:21:29] of the sport court but around a concrete
[1:21:31] project you generally have boards that
[1:21:34] support the walls where the concrete is
[1:21:35] gonna and you've got these posts like
[1:21:37] every eight or ten feet
[1:21:40] 12 feet holding up those boards so in my
[1:21:43] mind I'm driving to Bellingham and I'm
[1:21:45] thinking about how am I going to level
[1:21:47] the sport Cork and the Lord dropped a
[1:21:50] thought into my head of make a grid
[1:21:53] Square
[1:21:54] make a grid Square
[1:21:56] and just pull a string
[1:21:59] to every post across from each other all
[1:22:03] the way down the sides and then across
[1:22:05] the ends and make it squares of 12 foot
[1:22:08] squares level the squares up to the
[1:22:10] string and your sport quote will be
[1:22:12] level
[1:22:13] like that took a second
[1:22:15] and
[1:22:16] on that inspiration by Monday we leveled
[1:22:20] an entire 125 the con the concrete
[1:22:23] contractor was blown away he showed up
[1:22:26] on Tuesday morning saying how how did
[1:22:29] you here
[1:22:30] how did you do this I said five gallon
[1:22:35] buckets in some string
[1:22:37] and we leveled up maybe he didn't like
[1:22:39] communicate inspiration
[1:22:42] to everyone like we want to say
[1:22:45] we took over a camp I was a mom that
[1:22:48] cooked for a family of six yeah
[1:22:50] he worked in missions had sales
[1:22:53] background
[1:22:54] we were doing something that we had
[1:22:57] never done before no one trained us
[1:23:00] how do I know how much potatoes to cook
[1:23:03] for 150 people I have no idea
[1:23:06] we were under constant a constant prayer
[1:23:11] asking the Lord for inspiration like
[1:23:13] praying for wisdom with everything we
[1:23:16] did we needed help like I lived on James
[1:23:19] 1 5.
[1:23:22] guaranteed so this lasts how long the
[1:23:26] whole Camp experience yeah the whole
[1:23:27] Camp experience really was how many
[1:23:30] years yeah about 10 10 years and eight
[1:23:33] of those were on on surrounds we live on
[1:23:35] grounds yeah in the mountains now we're
[1:23:37] getting closer and closer to your
[1:23:40] arrival here yeah
[1:23:42] 2020 comes
[1:23:43] 2020 comes and Washington state was
[1:23:47] probably up there well the the West
[1:23:50] Coast
[1:23:51] they shut everything down like if you
[1:23:53] were a venue if you had any more than
[1:23:57] two people show up at any one time like
[1:23:59] that was not permitted so the camp
[1:24:00] closed like immediately all of our
[1:24:03] groups canceled of course we dealt with
[1:24:05] all churches all churches were closed so
[1:24:10] um the opportunity to make Revenue
[1:24:12] completely shut off so I I actually laid
[1:24:14] myself off
[1:24:16] in uh in April of 2020. now we we can't
[1:24:20] go past this without mentioning
[1:24:21] somewhere right before this yeah you
[1:24:24] start roasting coffee yeah
[1:24:28] Kind of a Funny Hobby
[1:24:30] like going back to my sales World I'd
[1:24:33] been introduced to coffee and we drink a
[1:24:35] lot of coffee and I told Debbie I said
[1:24:38] you know if I could just roast my own
[1:24:40] you know that would just be that would
[1:24:42] be the cat's meow you know if I could
[1:24:44] just roast my own coffee so she found
[1:24:46] this little uh toaster oven kind of a
[1:24:49] toaster that you can roast six or eight
[1:24:50] ounces of coffee beans in at a time and
[1:24:52] I thought I'd hit the big time so that
[1:24:55] was that was literally the extent of
[1:24:58] what we thought was going to be our our
[1:25:01] roasting coffee for you yeah yeah and
[1:25:04] then
[1:25:06] we we moved off we moved off of the camp
[1:25:09] because I kind of I have this I have
[1:25:12] this underlying feeling in 2016 2017.
[1:25:17] that
[1:25:18] a 50s Within Reach age-wise and
[1:25:25] I don't see myself living at camp for
[1:25:27] another 20 years and retiring
[1:25:31] you pay your bills right it's a
[1:25:33] non-profit there's not like a big
[1:25:35] retirement program for anybody I've got
[1:25:37] a young family we're not in church very
[1:25:40] much
[1:25:41] um
[1:25:42] I need to I need to move off ground so I
[1:25:45] met with the board and
[1:25:48] um let them know what we were thinking
[1:25:49] and how we could make this all pencil
[1:25:51] and make it work so we did we bought a
[1:25:54] house in Blaine in uh the end of 2016
[1:25:58] very very nice place and the Lord really
[1:26:02] helped us out a lot
[1:26:06] so we set up this little tiny coffee
[1:26:08] roaster in the back shed you know so I
[1:26:10] could have coffee on them on the
[1:26:12] weekends and I could roast coffee and
[1:26:14] somehow a neighbor found out that we
[1:26:17] have this little coffee roasting thing
[1:26:18] going and asked for four pounds
[1:26:21] and it took us like eight hours to roast
[1:26:24] this coffee on this little tiny thing
[1:26:26] I'm like
[1:26:28] this isn't gonna work
[1:26:30] I said hey this is a great opportunity I
[1:26:32] know we don't have a lot of money but we
[1:26:34] should buy a bigger roaster so we took
[1:26:36] the next couple of months and we found a
[1:26:38] bigger roaster that roasted three pounds
[1:26:40] at a time
[1:26:41] and that was that was our next you know
[1:26:43] cat's meow moment so you start roasting
[1:26:46] coffee thinking possibly another Revenue
[1:26:49] stream yeah yeah this could this could
[1:26:52] supplement the offset maybe some of the
[1:26:54] camp time so when we're not busy at the
[1:26:57] camp I could stay home roast coffee and
[1:26:59] start building up some business in that
[1:27:01] regard and so
[1:27:03] Debbie showed somebody the coffee and
[1:27:06] they loved it well they own an espresso
[1:27:08] stand
[1:27:10] well an espresso stand uses a lot of
[1:27:12] coffee and now I'm looking at sitting at
[1:27:15] the coffee roaster for eight hours a day
[1:27:16] two three days a week I I do that I have
[1:27:19] a camp to run need a bigger coffee
[1:27:21] roaster absolutely it's just natural it
[1:27:24] makes sense
[1:27:26] so we started looking for a bigger
[1:27:28] coffee roaster and I mean the it would
[1:27:31] take time to tell the entire story but
[1:27:33] miraculously we get the coffee roaster
[1:27:35] that I have now roast 25 pounds at a
[1:27:38] time and so we set that up here in in
[1:27:41] the shop in late 2019 uh mid-2019
[1:27:45] mid-2019 not knowing that within six
[1:27:49] months covid was going to hit and shut
[1:27:52] everything down
[1:27:53] but at the same at the same time covet
[1:27:56] is hitting another Coffee Roasting
[1:27:59] Company
[1:28:00] comes up for sale kind of the Lord is
[1:28:03] really
[1:28:04] preparing like he's he's creating a path
[1:28:07] at this time yeah I get a phone call
[1:28:10] from our competitors customer who lets
[1:28:14] us know that the competitor passed away
[1:28:16] and their business is closing and could
[1:28:19] we Supply coffee to them
[1:28:21] well I'm not thinking about coffee for
[1:28:24] the to supply them I'm thinking our
[1:28:27] competitors closing their business
[1:28:29] and Derek needs to go talk to them
[1:28:32] so we try to call him try to call him
[1:28:34] can't get a hold of him so finally I'm
[1:28:35] just like you know let's jump in the car
[1:28:37] and drive over there and see what it's
[1:28:39] all about so it takes 40 minutes or so
[1:28:41] 45 minutes and we pull in and the doors
[1:28:44] cracked open there's hardly nobody
[1:28:46] around per se it's in an industrial park
[1:28:48] and so we walk in the door and this
[1:28:52] ladies at a at the back of the warehouse
[1:28:54] packaging coffee and she said I'll be
[1:28:57] with you in just a minute it's my last
[1:28:58] bag and I said oh that's okay I was just
[1:29:01] popping in to see who's running the show
[1:29:03] oh no we closed
[1:29:05] I said
[1:29:07] closed she's like this is literally the
[1:29:11] last bag and we've closed ever ever
[1:29:14] we're done I said
[1:29:16] who owns it
[1:29:18] and she told me who it was and she said
[1:29:20] but she's not taking any calls and I
[1:29:23] said
[1:29:25] who's close to her and so she told me
[1:29:27] her dad the lady's dad
[1:29:29] so I right there on the spot reached out
[1:29:32] to him and within a couple of days we
[1:29:36] drew up papers and I bought her out to
[1:29:39] pay her out over the next two years
[1:29:42] because covet had hit their sales had
[1:29:45] disappeared
[1:29:46] all the cafes the restaurants everything
[1:29:48] everybody that they sold to had stopped
[1:29:51] buying coffee so they thought they
[1:29:53] didn't have anything
[1:29:55] um so I told her well if
[1:29:58] if nothing comes of it you aren't out
[1:30:00] anything but if I start selling a lot of
[1:30:03] coffee I'm willing to pay on everything
[1:30:04] I sell so I did I was able to pay her
[1:30:07] for the next two years as a widow and
[1:30:09] she did pretty well so we got good in a
[1:30:12] very short period of time you went
[1:30:14] full-blown coffee business yeah like it
[1:30:17] there was almost no transition between
[1:30:19] the camp and coffee like it just it just
[1:30:22] Blended one right into the other Coffee
[1:30:25] started up in a major way yeah now we're
[1:30:28] getting to the place where we're gonna
[1:30:29] we're gonna have to bring this down and
[1:30:30] wrap this up and I know we've been here
[1:30:32] a minute and
[1:30:33] but I don't want to move on without the
[1:30:36] opportunity because you mentioned it
[1:30:38] briefly
[1:30:39] about David's healing and maybe we can't
[1:30:42] give it as much time as we wanted to but
[1:30:45] but just for the for the sake of it I
[1:30:47] think it's a great testimony
[1:30:50] what was it he was born with
[1:30:52] congenital hyper insulin
[1:30:55] let's explain that briefly his pancreas
[1:30:58] never stopped producing insulin
[1:31:01] so where
[1:31:03] it's like the opposite of diabetes so
[1:31:06] when I took him to the emergency room
[1:31:08] after one of his seizures they tested
[1:31:12] his blood sugar and it was Zero
[1:31:14] so that's where he functioned so he was
[1:31:18] put on medications
[1:31:20] round-the-clock care checking on him
[1:31:22] every two hours trying to keep him from
[1:31:24] having seizures trying to keep his blood
[1:31:26] sugar up
[1:31:27] and weeks at Children's Hospital yeah
[1:31:30] lots of time in the hospital children's
[1:31:32] hospital and basically you get to the
[1:31:35] place to where your only option is
[1:31:37] take out the pancreas the pancreas and
[1:31:42] intentionally make him a diabetic yes
[1:31:44] that's your only option because pancreas
[1:31:47] won't turn off right yes so y'all end up
[1:31:51] in is it Philadelphia yeah Children's
[1:31:53] Hospital Philadelphia
[1:31:54] and it is the night before the surgery
[1:31:57] where they're going to remove his
[1:31:59] pancake and they actually say to you
[1:32:01] it's gonna be better to take diabetes
[1:32:03] home with you or something yeah so we
[1:32:05] met the research scientist the night
[1:32:06] before when we had to sign papers for
[1:32:09] David to lose his pancreas and the
[1:32:11] research scientist looked me in the eye
[1:32:12] and he said you want to take home
[1:32:15] diabetes you don't want to take home
[1:32:17] hyperinolism and I said I don't want to
[1:32:19] take home either right yeah he said I
[1:32:22] understand but you need to sign the
[1:32:24] paper
[1:32:24] so David's 10 months old at this point
[1:32:27] at this point it's been nothing but
[1:32:28] Health struggles and health troubles
[1:32:30] yeah
[1:32:32] you're sitting there it's got to be
[1:32:33] tough signing papers going I'm going to
[1:32:36] make him a diabetic but at the same time
[1:32:37] well you realize lesser of two evils
[1:32:40] types you realize that the struggle is
[1:32:42] not going to end because now you've got
[1:32:44] to maintain insulin and there's still
[1:32:46] medication involved and so it's not
[1:32:49] doesn't really feel better
[1:32:51] so it so that night
[1:32:53] you go to Google
[1:32:55] this is the night before the surgery and
[1:32:57] just tell them what you come across yeah
[1:32:59] so I had actually searched a lot all
[1:33:02] through throughout David's sickness
[1:33:04] because you're looking for anything you
[1:33:06] can to try to help your child but that
[1:33:08] night
[1:33:10] I start searching again for Alternatives
[1:33:12] like there's got to be another
[1:33:15] there's got to be something else and I
[1:33:17] come across a medical journal
[1:33:20] where someone had had pancreatic cancer
[1:33:23] and the doctor did a procedure called a
[1:33:27] ruin Y which
[1:33:29] it you know the pancreas looks like this
[1:33:32] it cuts off the this part of the
[1:33:34] pancreas it reattaches it somewhere else
[1:33:36] that's what a ruined why would be that's
[1:33:39] the easiest way to explain it
[1:33:41] so I find this online and I just close
[1:33:45] my computer and I say that's got to be
[1:33:47] it that's got to be the answer
[1:33:49] and that's it I just we go to sleep and
[1:33:52] the next day we take David down for
[1:33:55] surgery
[1:33:56] they medicate him and the nurses take
[1:33:58] him away and the surgeon comes in
[1:34:01] the surgeon is one of two people in the
[1:34:04] entire world that work on the condition
[1:34:07] that David had so there's him in Seattle
[1:34:11] or not Seattle but Philadelphia
[1:34:13] Children's Hospital there's another
[1:34:15] surgeon that's at Great Ormond Street in
[1:34:18] London England two men in the world that
[1:34:20] do this David is case number 104 in
[1:34:24] Children's Hospital Philadelphia
[1:34:26] like in history in history yeah at this
[1:34:29] point he's number 104. so the surgeon
[1:34:32] walks into the room in a suit very
[1:34:35] powerful man like he's he's the guy
[1:34:37] and he says do you have any other
[1:34:39] questions I haven't even asked him any
[1:34:41] questions I haven't met him before
[1:34:44] so I said yes if you have the
[1:34:46] opportunity will you do a row and Y on
[1:34:49] David's pancreas
[1:34:50] and he looks up at the corner of the
[1:34:52] room and he says yep
[1:34:55] turns on his heel and walks out the door
[1:34:57] at that moment when he looks up to the
[1:35:00] corner of the room I look down at his
[1:35:01] hands and I just pray not his hands Lord
[1:35:03] but yours
[1:35:05] and that's it he walks out the door
[1:35:07] that's the last time we see him never
[1:35:09] saw him again and you're wondering what
[1:35:10] in the world to ruin why yeah
[1:35:13] it was
[1:35:16] Derek did he turned to me right after he
[1:35:18] walked out he said I ruined what
[1:35:21] what did you just ask him to do
[1:35:23] I said I don't really know but
[1:35:26] I found this thing on Google
[1:35:31] let's remember that I got my GED I did
[1:35:34] not even graduate high school I have no
[1:35:36] medical background that was inspiration
[1:35:38] from the Lord
[1:35:40] and he does it he does it
[1:35:42] successful yeah so he um he resects
[1:35:47] David's pancreas they slice until they
[1:35:50] take out the part that's producing
[1:35:51] insulin non-stop they reattach his
[1:35:54] pancreas down below so that it still
[1:35:57] produces digestive enzymes it still
[1:35:59] produces insulin it still functions just
[1:36:02] like it would have if it was still in
[1:36:04] one part but now it's in two parts
[1:36:07] and now because of that other children
[1:36:09] who have the same disease it's actually
[1:36:13] listed in the pamphlet as an option yes
[1:36:16] yeah yeah because of what happened
[1:36:19] that's awesome yeah yeah that's an
[1:36:21] incredible story
[1:36:24] so didn't you say like immediately his
[1:36:27] blood sugar leveled up yes he came out
[1:36:29] of surgery he wasn't even awake and his
[1:36:31] blood sugar was completely normal and I
[1:36:33] said he's not on any medication right
[1:36:35] now like for the condition that she said
[1:36:37] no no he hasn't been on that since last
[1:36:39] night
[1:36:41] he's not on anything no he's not on
[1:36:43] anything his blood sugar was 70. it was
[1:36:46] normal we'll praise the Lord yeah the
[1:36:48] procedure was so new when we were
[1:36:50] checking out and you're you're going
[1:36:52] through you know all the things within
[1:36:54] the nurse that checks you out right and
[1:36:57] um Debbie said can you see in there
[1:36:59] where it says definitively how much
[1:37:02] of David's pancreas was removed and she
[1:37:05] said oh it was like 95 and Debbie's like
[1:37:08] no no
[1:37:09] um it should be more like 15 and we're
[1:37:11] trying to see the the notes the surgeons
[1:37:13] notes you know because he dictates and
[1:37:16] um she's like no no it would have been
[1:37:18] it would have been 95 here see right
[1:37:22] here oh
[1:37:24] oh that's just that's not biologically
[1:37:26] possible I don't think they could do
[1:37:28] that and Debbie's like what did they do
[1:37:31] he only has 15 removed
[1:37:34] so he ended up with only so it was such
[1:37:36] a new thing yeah even the the staff
[1:37:39] there was like no it didn't make sense
[1:37:40] yes we thank God that you found that
[1:37:43] medical journal on Google that's right
[1:37:45] that's incredible yes so I wanted us to
[1:37:49] tell that story and then bring us back
[1:37:50] it's 20 20. yeah
[1:37:53] you're no longer able to go to church
[1:37:55] yeah a lot of people all over the world
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:37:59] but it was it got to the point where in
[1:38:01] Canada it lasted even longer you weren't
[1:38:04] able to go things were shut down yes
[1:38:07] you begin streaming here and there a lot
[1:38:09] of people were streaming different
[1:38:10] things and God's really doing things in
[1:38:13] your home at this time yes dealing with
[1:38:14] your children and yeah
[1:38:16] drawing you closer and just opening
[1:38:19] hearts
[1:38:20] and they stream or y'all stream
[1:38:24] the Oklahoma Youth Camp yeah we um
[1:38:28] I think we've got a link for the
[1:38:30] Oklahoma meeting so we started streaming
[1:38:32] those those were awesome I mean I don't
[1:38:35] know if there it had been it probably a
[1:38:37] year but since there were any kind of
[1:38:39] camps really anywhere right and um
[1:38:43] so the end of the Oklahoma meetings and
[1:38:46] then I think brother Andrew Glover came
[1:38:48] here Donald Winston preached and so we
[1:38:50] streamed that and uh Lily said Dad
[1:38:55] whatever we've got to do you've got to
[1:38:57] get us to their Easter meetings they're
[1:38:58] having they're having camp at church for
[1:39:01] Easter we've got to be there and in the
[1:39:04] back of my mind I'm like okay covid
[1:39:07] flying the tickets the cost of
[1:39:10] everything is just going to be
[1:39:11] insurmountable like we're not going to
[1:39:13] be able to put that together
[1:39:14] and um
[1:39:16] but I said yes
[1:39:21] that can change a lot can change but I
[1:39:25] which the kids know a lot can change and
[1:39:29] they've seen me change before you know
[1:39:31] oh we're we're going to do vacation in a
[1:39:33] couple of months and a lot changes we
[1:39:35] don't go on vacation so that potential
[1:39:38] disappointment has kind of ever been set
[1:39:40] up and happened in the past
[1:39:44] and I felt like I told Debbie I said I
[1:39:47] don't think we can afford to fail
[1:39:50] I think we've got to figure out how to
[1:39:51] pull it off
[1:39:52] so let's see how many miles we've got so
[1:39:56] I scrounge credit card miles and miles
[1:39:59] from bonuses of this thing and that
[1:40:02] thing
[1:40:03] we're really sure like we're only
[1:40:05] halfway there and I said didn't you sign
[1:40:08] up for a for Alaska Airlines card or
[1:40:10] something like that some time ago just
[1:40:12] to get the miles and you get the bonus
[1:40:14] miles
[1:40:15] and um yeah I think it took us a while
[1:40:17] to find the card she sat on hold for
[1:40:19] like two hours two hours yeah and
[1:40:22] finally the guy he's like frustrated
[1:40:24] that this person's still on hold it's
[1:40:26] not just going away so he's like ma'am
[1:40:30] um
[1:40:31] you don't even have your password
[1:40:33] to your account
[1:40:34] to even verify that you have any miles
[1:40:35] she goes I know that's why I'm asking
[1:40:38] you he's like
[1:40:40] please hold so he puts her on hold again
[1:40:42] he comes back he's like all right it's
[1:40:44] all set it's here's your account here's
[1:40:46] your password and everything and she's
[1:40:48] like well how many miles are on there
[1:40:50] and he's like
[1:40:51] um looks like 105 000. so it's like a
[1:40:55] hundred thousand miles on there I think
[1:40:57] he just put them on there
[1:40:58] credit
[1:41:04] [Music]
[1:41:07] so here we miraculously have enough
[1:41:10] miles for all of us to come for sixty
[1:41:12] dollars sixty dollars each no total all
[1:41:16] six of us like ten dollars a person
[1:41:19] we've flew to Louisiana
[1:41:21] praise the Lord yeah yeah and then I
[1:41:24] mean there's a cost to stay
[1:41:26] like that could run you a thousand
[1:41:28] fifteen hundred bucks for a week because
[1:41:30] we figure if we're going to come down
[1:41:31] here for the Easter meetings you might
[1:41:33] as well at least enjoy it and stay for a
[1:41:35] couple of days maybe a week would be
[1:41:37] nice we haven't had a vacation in a
[1:41:39] while
[1:41:41] but it's going to be expensive so I let
[1:41:44] brother Timothy know that we were coming
[1:41:45] in
[1:41:47] um you know the kids are looking at
[1:41:48] airbnbs and hotels and you know we're
[1:41:50] the dollar signs are getting higher to
[1:41:52] the point where it's starting to feel
[1:41:55] like we need to push back here a little
[1:41:56] bit
[1:41:57] and brother Timothy said what if I got
[1:41:59] you a place to stay for the whole week
[1:42:01] for nothing I said that's better than
[1:42:03] 60.
[1:42:09] so we came and it was it was amazing it
[1:42:11] was
[1:42:12] we I mean you haven't been in church for
[1:42:15] a while and you see God dealing with
[1:42:17] your hearts I mean just from sitting
[1:42:19] here for a few minutes you remember what
[1:42:21] happened to me when I first gave my
[1:42:23] heart to the Lord and I'm seeing that
[1:42:25] same level of reaction happening in my
[1:42:28] kids and
[1:42:30] uh that's what you want like you can
[1:42:32] have a lot of things but if you can have
[1:42:35] that what wouldn't you do amen that's
[1:42:38] right so we went home from the Easter
[1:42:40] meetings very impacted
[1:42:43] um
[1:42:44] by Church by the People by what we had
[1:42:48] seen God already doing in our lives the
[1:42:50] way that he'd set up things for us we're
[1:42:53] walking down the main street of Minden
[1:42:55] and a guy who we know now
[1:42:58] um but you didn't know then we didn't
[1:42:59] know then uh he stopped us on the street
[1:43:02] like we're walk on a Saturday main
[1:43:03] Street's pretty quiet and
[1:43:06] he strikes up a conversation with us
[1:43:08] asks what we do ask it for visiting and
[1:43:11] he said yeah we're visiting from the
[1:43:12] Pacific Northwest oh are you moving to
[1:43:14] Minden
[1:43:15] we're not moving to Minden it's hot here
[1:43:21] moving to Minden we live in the Pacific
[1:43:24] Northwest it's cool he's like well what
[1:43:26] do you do I said well I'm a coffee
[1:43:28] roaster oh we need a coffee roaster here
[1:43:30] we need a coffee matter of fact we need
[1:43:32] a coffee shop in our town we don't even
[1:43:34] have a good coffee shop in this town if
[1:43:36] you moved here you could roast coffee
[1:43:37] and have a coffee shop I mean he's
[1:43:39] setting it all I don't know him
[1:43:40] so
[1:43:43] we get in the car and I'm like this is a
[1:43:45] little weird I mean this guy's asking us
[1:43:47] if we're moving to Minden that's so he
[1:43:50] comes back and knocks on the window he
[1:43:52] said don't give up on us
[1:43:53] we need you in Minden
[1:43:55] and I just thought
[1:43:57] that is really strange
[1:43:59] well I've told other people that story
[1:44:01] and Mike wise in this town is not known
[1:44:04] to be outgoing not known to be one that
[1:44:07] would approach anybody and talk to them
[1:44:10] just out of the blue so I felt like that
[1:44:13] was look you look back now I was very
[1:44:15] taken back by it because we're from the
[1:44:17] Pacific Northwest we don't talk to
[1:44:19] people unapproached
[1:44:21] we observe from a distance
[1:44:24] and if somebody waves at you on the you
[1:44:27] know like you're driving down the street
[1:44:29] and somebody waves you're like what are
[1:44:31] they doing do I know you
[1:44:34] that's the specific Northwest
[1:44:36] anyway we were feeling we were feeling
[1:44:38] definitely a pull
[1:44:40] to go we didn't know where the Lord was
[1:44:43] leading us to go but we were feeling
[1:44:45] that and I can't give you a real reason
[1:44:47] why but it was happening and we had
[1:44:51] tried to go to Virginia we had tried to
[1:44:54] go to brother Ron's and those doors
[1:44:57] closed quickly hard twice in a row and
[1:45:00] we're like okay
[1:45:01] and so that's yeah you know when you're
[1:45:05] coming to a season but you don't know
[1:45:07] what it holds yeah you know it brother
[1:45:10] Timothy has preached on seasons and
[1:45:12] changes and when you're coming to Spring
[1:45:15] you know that there's going to be leaves
[1:45:16] on the trees but you don't really know
[1:45:18] what they're going to look like until
[1:45:19] they actually develop you don't know
[1:45:21] what the blossoms are really going to
[1:45:22] look like and so we felt the season
[1:45:24] changing but really didn't know what it
[1:45:26] was going to develop into and as we went
[1:45:30] through those those first Oklahoma camp
[1:45:33] meetings and God moving on the on the
[1:45:34] young people and
[1:45:36] and then coming here
[1:45:38] um we've really started to see the
[1:45:41] picture developing and the way that God
[1:45:43] allowed us to come and some Supernatural
[1:45:45] things that he did for us when we went
[1:45:47] back home
[1:45:48] um really just showed us that um this is
[1:45:51] where we needed to be
[1:45:53] and we got to be with sister Kathy again
[1:45:55] I mean
[1:45:56] a little piece of home little piece of
[1:45:59] home well
[1:46:01] thank y'all yeah so much for sharing and
[1:46:04] you know churches

[1:46:09] families and through the years we we've
[1:46:12] had that here strong family strong
[1:46:14] foundations and and we're just thankful
[1:46:16] that another piece was added and that
