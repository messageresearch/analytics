been touched by the spirit of god amen i got something i want to share with you if i can bring it up here [Music] amen i'm just glad to be in the house of the lord i just want to let you in on god's touch this morning i know it's been shared some on no doubt social media and things but amen we we uh have a little a little chat here with a lot of ministers in it and we this this testimony was shared and as you can tell lots of other testimony been shared you know it's good to know that it ain't all bad news amen the devil wants you to think it's all bad news but it's not all bad news matter of fact it's good news it's the gospel of jesus christ you know we've been uh remembering sister erica parker in our prayers every service trying to bring her name before you brother donny reagan shared this just a few days ago said sister erica had her follow-up today from the scans you had tuesday the scan showed us just scar tissue now and no growth which is good they wanted to go to nashville to see if there's a clinical trial she can participate and to be sure it never starts growing again as of now she's cancer-free [Music] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord oh what a mighty god we serve cancer free he's a good god her sister-in-law sister crystal works in that field with specifically with cancer a lot of times and she said the type of cancer she has is treatable but it's not curable so it's a very big thing that there's no more cancer left in her body that's what the word of god can do sure god uses doctors but it takes god to heal and god to deliver and god is set free you know and i as we told these testimonies i i was reminded of that quote brother branham talked about he said it's time to have her joy shoes on amen to rejoice in the things of god and you know brother there's a little little fellow in this church his name is drew dexter and he he um he's quite the prayer warrior he knows what it's like for god to heal and deliver he's witnessed it in his own life and he's seen god move in miraculous ways as a matter of fact just recently as he was brought up here for prayer he was on some quite extensive therapy for his thyroids and things and some some really crazy medicines but even now the doctors have said his thyroid levels are perfect and he don't even have to have the medicine no more he knows what it's like to be healed and he's been praying every night for erica and brother mike just a few days ago or maybe weeks ago come home and just felt a real burden for my sister esther as he come home if i understand the story right comes into the house [Music] finds brother i'll call him brother drew on the floor in the bathroom crying out for his aunt sister to his aunt esther to have a baby amen god's out of the mouth of babes and so as he heard this news i believe they got this ready i want you to see amen the reaction this is just a few minutes into his reaction brother brother drew got happy because god answered his prayer amen go ahead he's saying thank you jesus why are you happy drew why are you happy drew sister thank you lord thank you thank you thank you much thank you jesus very much hallelujah hallelujah oh praise the name of the lord [Music] oh my my my my what a mighty god we serve this is sister erica's testimony said that she said extra extra read all about it my god is awesome miracle worker promise keeper waymaker healer chain breaker i guess you know by what i'm saying what i've said what i'm going to say i've got my results from the cat scan today shows car scar tissue but no cancer they're sending me to sarah canassen and center to nashville to see if they have any available clinical trials to ensure it doesn't come back my doctor's so happy to tell us the news he said we praise god here every day thank you so much for every prayer there each one so appreciated the love and support we have felt in the past six months has been overwhelming i'm so overjoyed at what the lord has done for me his promises never failed there is nothing too hard for god the battle is over the victory's won it's already done praise the lord amen so i believe we ought to get our joy shoes on because god answered that prayer he's going to answer another prayer hallelujah brother brother drew as he run around he began to holler out brother ron's next i say amen i'm looking for the fulfillment of that healing in that body god's done some mighty things and he's been a great miracle given about two or three months to live and now we're a year past right at a year now from his time of going and finding the cancer in his body but his word never fails hallelujah therefore we can be confident and bring these needs before the lord knowing he hears our prayers amen brother david james has asked for prayer for a helen carter i understand he's got covered really bad and needs prayer and also um is a tiffany wales that has passed away want to remember the family as we mentioned brother ron we want to continue to remember brother ron i believe here for too long we'll be able to stand here and give testimony of his healing and his deliverance also brother kenneth has been really struggling in his body been in and out of the hospital i'm not is he in there now do we know he's in there right now so we want to remember him in prayer also sister elizabeth butts is not feeling well today uh sister lauria and tustin is not feeling well as well i remember that those needs i also want to remember brother aaron oglesby he's in he's away here in uh dallas brother mcgarry's minister in this weekend so we just want to remember him as he's no doubt even in the pulpit as of now so let's just remember these needs how many would have it up that's his hand say god

lifted to him say here don't pass me by lord i need you to speak to me i need you to reveal yourself come lord jesus come father me as we bow our heads today and we reflect on our needs lord we reflect on then how great a god that there is that can supply every need and so we're looking to you lord we're looking to you to move in this service to anoint the lips of man to speak as an oracle of god lord i can do nothing without you i know that and depending on your anointing i'm depending on your presence the angel of god just to come real among us today the angels to lying and come by every seat walk down every aisle deal with every heart lord may we be conscious today of your presence that we would be like jacob was when he saw the ladder come down from heaven and angels ascended and descended and he says surely god is in this place may it be lord the same today that the angels of god just come down through the way made at calvary and ascend and descend upon the son of man upon christ in bright form that is working in this day may he just manifest his glory you just speak his word lord lord just minister as a to us today there are needs lord they're the lost there are the the dying there are the sick the afflicted there are the needy lord not only here but across this land lord there are those that are at this moment that are dying with coveted we we hear of the different ones lord that is there and the doctors have done all they can do they can't breathe lord we we realize father that it's going to take a miracle but you're that kind of god and we commission lord the angels of god to go by the bedsides of the sick those that are in the hospital our brother kenneth that's in the hospital may he be visited by the angel of the lord and the pillar of fire just hover over him and bring healing in the name of jesus these others lord that are in need of god as we said some gasp in their last breath god have mercy lord we get news oh god of little churches that the pastor has now died and lord there are situations that are there and lord we can't answer them all but you can you send laborers into the harvest for the harvest is ready labors are few but lord send them father send us today as a messenger as we go through across the lands across the airways across the the video stream into the little places in the homes and little churches and places and different faraway countries and they see oh god the holy spirit moving lord may then oh god faith just rises it draws that angel right into their presence and brings healing and deliverance for them too lord they're your people for you've got to bride around the world not just one here in this assembly but around the world and bless your bride lord we hear of things happening we hear of we hear wonderful testimonies of cancers healed and delivered and and other churches and places where you have moved and you've done miraculous works lord oh god we thank you father that it's not just right here in our little corner but you care about your people everywhere because that gives us confidence that it's not just us in your favor but you have everybody your whole bride in your favor may oh god today they received from you oh god made faith just break out and dawn in their lives and hearts to believe the word of promise for themselves and as people sit in this church today i pray the angel of god will visit them each one going by every pew quickening the words i think it was like with ruth where you commissioned the angels as well as did his servants commission his servants drop a few handfuls on purpose lord may it be today that you the lord of the harvest commission your angels just to drop handfuls let me just see a spark from one place to the other where revelation comes in the hearts and things changes lives and the dynamics of the holy ghost thrill through this building making the car move down to healing and deliverance and salvation and she ever needs supply we give ourselves to you now father i'm yours i can do nothing without you i'm just looking to find that vein of anointing lord and to step in it lord that i can speak as an oracle of god that you just use my voice today to minister to a need to speak to a heart to reveal the thoughts and intents of the heart ever need supply we pray in jesus name as we wait on you amen and amen let's just praise him for doing it already hallelujah thank you lord for doing it thank you for your work and among us thank you that you're the same yesterday today and forever thank you that you're alive among your people amen that you're here in your church this morning amen amen god bless you genesis chapter 18 and verse 1. if you look into the word of god with me this morning it's wonderful we can start with his word and we can read the prophecy concerning ourselves amen and then walk into the vision amen i believe we're people of the book don't you amen that's what we've been speaking on the people of the book and we're looking right here at the abraham accords that was given here to abraham who is the father of our faith and the faith of abraham is in every child of god because we are the seed of abraham through jesus christ the royal seed of abraham and god would take the natural seed here to do do a great work in order that he might prophesy and foretell of what he would do in his bride coming in this last day genesis 18 verse 1 and the lord did you notice capital l capital o kepler r capital d this is no common angel this is god himself and he's making an appearing unto abraham and we're abraham's seed and we're here in his the time of his appearing amen he's appeared to you and to you and to you and to you you know when he appeared to you you heard the song this morning you know if you know if i shout you don't know why i'm shouting it's because he's appeared to me he changed my life amen he made me a new creation in christ and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory in the as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and lull three men stood by him and he saw them and he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself to the ground and he was no trinitarian for he said my lord if i have found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant and it didn't matter how many manifestations he had seen god in whether it had been as melchizedek or elohim or jehovah or as um el shaddai what manifestation god's revealed himself and each one of these was a revelation of himself you know el shaddai the breasted god the need supplier the almighty amen and so here he is comes as elohim and he here he's standing now in human flesh that he is wrapped around himself for visitation amen and remember angels are visting the earth right now amen and to reveal them to reveal himself he will wrap himself in human flesh in your flesh and my flesh because that's where the angel of god is being revealed is in his people and he says let um verse 3 my lord if i found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant how many feels that way today lord if i've found favor amen if i've got grace in your eyes don't pass me by come and abide with me amen and i will fetch some morsel bread or verse four and let a little water i pray you be fixed and wash your feet and rest yourself from under the tree and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that you shall pass on and therefore are you come to your servant and they said so do as thou has said and the abraham hastened unto the tent unto sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the hearth and abraham ran to the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it to a young man and hastened to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now abraham and sarah was old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah live saying shall i of a surely bear a child which i'm old is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son and then sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou didst life god bless you you can be seated we're going to be speaking today on the angel's visitation and i i as we start in this service here today of course we are living in a great hour a great time of um of great trouble upon the earth we are living in a time where the in the political arena in our united states of america that our freedoms are quickly being taken away from us as we see the according to revelation 13 the the the beast that rose up like a lamb has now begun to speak like a dragon so we're living in some very peculiar times it's troublesome hours and i just i as i'm thinking of this i wanted to share with you something that brother branham preached called watchman one of the night he said oh my friends listen to thus saith the lord if you consider me to be a servant is just before the break of day that's why this horrible gloom is over the earth it's just before the coming of the lord jesus there's no more hope left in nothing but is coming nations are against nations and they have filled through god's laboratory till they got power to blow one another into atomic ashes and they're wicked and they're unreligious and they're unchrist-like and the only motive they have and objective is to destroy and they are inspired what you at least listen these words they are inspired by the destroying angel that was sent from heaven to inspire these men let me say in the name of the lord jesus the holy spirit was sent as a watchman on the tower and the people cry what of the night and he says are you weary of this life are you weary of sin are you weary of funeral possessions and on sickness and ungodliness on every hand has the night been long and weary what other night watchmen and he said the morning come and see the comfort and the night is coming also so we're in a time when the night is coming and you know it's it's dark the watchman says the night cometh but also the morning so just remember that no matter what we see going wrong that we know the morning's coming as i was there this week and looking over the waters and looking watching the sun to rise and i saw you know as it were the sun as it broke over the horizon and and watching first um the morning star as it came out to herald the coming of the day and that's what god sent in this day was a messenger to herald the coming of the lord and actually you two are a herald of his coming because we are announcing the approaching day that's why we are of a different people we are a different race we are of a different culture we're not we're not just a americans living here we're more than that we're we're sons and daughters of god and we're getting ready for another kingdom to come and there is a kingdom that is now approaching and as it does you know the the darkness comes before the day but as it does the herald of the morning comes out and it begins to announce the coming of the day so you know though that we see you know and we're so weary of funeral processions and we're so weary because the night has been long and we're so weary because of sin and and sickness and ungodliness and i can hear some of you moan you know sometimes oh that could just all be over with you know that i'm so sick of this covader so sick of these diseases we're so sick of cancer uh coming against god's people and and sickness on every hannah and and and things that are rising that there's no cure for when the night has been long and it's weary oh but the morning cometh it's not going to remain nighttime all the time we're about to see the dawning of a new day and i i hear brother branham saying he's in our friend says no matter how much you pray how much you pray for wars to cease just remember this is coming for this coming from me if you believe me to tell you the truth it won't do any good we're at the end of the road and god said that the world would get in this condition so we are we're here it's a signpost and when you see these things begin to come to pass lift up your head your redemption draw it nigh oh my now of course this is this how is what god does is always before that he he sends destruction or an angel of destruction and just just let me tell you just as sure as i'm standing in this pulpit there is an angel of destruction that is already being felt it's an angel of death and it's already struck churches and it's already struck homes it's already struck societies it's already struck america do whatever you want to to try to revive her you can't revive her are you with me you can you can you know join any kind of political system that you that you want to join with or whatever you will never change her you can go demonstrate in washington it won't do any good whatever you want to do is there there's no turning around because an angel of destruction america as we know it is being destroyed and man i really the the religious values that we've stood upon as being undermined the whole thing is coming to an end and it won't get any better you you're you know we we cry and we say well the crooked voting machines and you know the crooked elections and and all of this and and you know you'd have to be a foolish foolish uh almost an idiot to believe it wasn't let me just say it that way amen or brainwash by listening to the news liberal agenda are you with me amen because you we know but i mean it was that way it was that way when the first catholic president came in and the prophet of god told you they they rigged the machines to get this to happen and we come right back in and it's rigged again so there's no nothing you can do to turn things around there's no hope for it there's only one thing that you can hope for and that's the morning coming on that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in christ shall rise so there is an angel of destruction but before that happens he sends an angel of mercy and i want you to know the angel of mercy is still here he's still among his people and this is what we were seeing that just before sodom was burned here god with an angel of mercy would come and visit abraham amen now the angel of the lord preaches righteousness and repentance and the coming of the lord and showing signs and all of this is to get us to believe let me just share this one little quotation as we go a little further into this and this is from will the church go through the tribulation and the church will but the bride won't i want you to notice this because we have to cross cut short here on the count of the prayer lines you notice what the angel said i can't do nothing until you come hither what was it was a message of deliverance one before one speck of fire could fall from heaven lot had to get out of sodom and before one drop of rain fell from the earth uh from from upon the earth from heaven noah went into the ark and before the atom bomb can strike this nation the church will go into rapture to meet the lord jesus and if the spudniks and the missiles are sad and the hammers are pulled back and the angels all stand in an order hallelujah he says the great quarters of heaven is crowded full the harps are all in tune the great bands are already practice up there is a home time coming pretty soon for the church of the living god who's been waiting for his coming everything's in order i'm so glad he said i'm so tired and all for that great hour you know to think we've had a part in this junction time and to remember so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is revealed from heaven now remember for the rain fell noah's in the ark for the fire fell lot was out of sodom for the angel said i can do nothing till you come hither i've got the leopard in my hand to pull and make the virus fall from heaven and i think that's exactly the the angel of destruction is holding the hand of russia with the atomic bombs until the church comes together as one great big body of christ and i can do nothing to you come hither oh if that isn't a blessed assurance if we see everything set in order the going home of the church is in order here is the angel of god with the same message performing the same signs the same wonders everything is set in order hallelujah can you imagine i can only think of him coming like isaac getting restless waiting for the caravan looking scanning every day making a move toward the well come on for the meeting in the air because we don't meet him in the heavens we meet him between the heavens and the earth just like isaac met the rebecca not at the tent but in at the well and we're about ready to make a move do you know what that means that means the easter the resurrection of all god's children is hanging low now and it's pressing on amen the angels are coming down the holy spirit is moving and the darkness has taken its last toll for the light will soon be here christ will come and the joy and the hope of all the ages of real resurrection for all believers for we will share with him in his resurrection as we have shared with him in his suffering last sunday we were preaching on who hath believed are you a believer amen that's who he appears to those who believe the report to them the arm of the lord is revealed amen we spoke of how the angel of the lord accompanies this message and and i i just want to remind you as we're talking about in the reason i am even bringing some of these things out i want you to remember that god doesn't forget his promise are you are you with me he doesn't forget his promise so for therefore the very angel that brought us a message is that very angel of the lord that is here to see it through he hasn't forgot us he hadn't forgot his promise as he said to sarah i will return according to the time of life there is a return of the angel and you should be under expectation amen we received a report that as a brother and his wife listened to the service they saw the angel of the lord come in their home and let tell you i'll just say this you need to live in a condition where the angel can appear to you or he's welcome in your home sister eileen walner told me of a testimony of seeing the pillar of fire where the angel of the lord brought healing to her house and let me tell you maybe you don't always see him because you know he can he to see him is never with these naked eyes it's with a it's with a spiritual eye that you see him amen because he is invisible to the eye the flesh as we'll get into the service in a little bit the flesh actually this flesh actually blinds us from his presence amen but you you neither do you feel him so much with your with your flesh you feeling with your spirit when he comes and passes by the holy spirit jesus said is is like a win he didn't say it was a win he said it was like a wind it moves in and you can tell by things that it does that he was there you know you never see the wind you just see the trees moving back and say well i see the wind that's blowing no you don't see the wind blowing you see the reaction of the of the the foliage to the wind so you don't actually see the wind but when the holy spirit begins to move and healings begin to happen or people begin to rejoice in the word or amens and hallelujahs begin to come forth it's the angel of god coming down and touching lives and you see the effects of them sister eileen you know her son david was born with a tear duct that was not complete and we all know sister walner brother joe's sister waldner that's brother joe's sister kathy morgan's brother and that's sister anita's mom and dad and her her son david was born with the tear duct it was not complete the tear duct was there but wouldn't drain the fluids and every morning his eye was completely covered with a green gummy substance that would glue his eyes shut and that eye appeared to be weak and a little smaller than the other and she would have to wash the eye out every day and throughout the day all through the day and in a prayer service a prophecy had went forth you still believe in prophecy don't you that said in three days you'll see the glory of god and the presence of god went home with them now that's what we want to happen you just don't want to have the presence that god felt at a meeting you want to take it home with you amen and the presence of god went home went with them as they went home and they went to bed that night and she was just still basking in the presence of the lord and she said lord you feel so near to me i feel like i could just reach out and touch you and and immediately speaking those words she saw a yellowish green light coming to the room and hover over her face it was like a living thing it was it quivered and felt warm on her skin it felt like a gentle caress and you know just was warm and beautiful and comforting yet it carried with it an awesome presence and in this experience he began to speak in other known tongues and or in unknown tongues and and immediately she she prophesied actually what it was is that light was now speaking using her vocal cords amen are you with me the light was used in her body to speak audible words and he says he says you are my child haven't i called you have not i said to you i will never leave you or forsake you but be with you even in you to the end because of your faith i will do it quickly even now and at that moment the light left and went right over to the baby crib and he the child let out a scream and was completely healed now i'm just gonna tell you i'm just gonna go ahead and tell you you get ready to see more and more of the angel of the lord and especially as the pillar of fire moves around us because he is here to confirm the message now you know brother branham had things to say about that and he says if you want the angels to appear to you keep your mind on god that's your war your battle right now in this service don't think the devil ain't here he's here to distract you pull your mind here pull it there think about the laundry the bills that need to be paid the things you're going to do next week whatever else i'm not going to ask for hands but you've already left this building several times today going here and there i want you to focus these are important times and man getting he says if you want angels to appear to you keep your mind on god and off the things of the world go about your dishes or your business go to your church go to go to washing your dishes or whatever you're doing but keep your mind on him all day all night long then god will do something you're drawing close to him you've got to keep the world shut out just you and he together you see you talk about running around with the world and flirt with the world and then expect to see angels and have miracles done that's out of god's program you must live right clean up the house clean up your habits clean up the things of the world get rid of your cards that's a little old-fashioned now get rid of some of these little video games and stuff that you got your mind wrapped into you've got men that can't even be can't even work can't even communicate with their family you got women that's so tied to social things that's right and they're too busy their minds on them i'll tell you what since the first of the year i've had a i've had a lot more peace you know what i did i just took a fast i hadn't looked at news even when going down the road you know i don't turn on the radio even i don't even listen enlightened on the on the radio for the for the for the gospel music i said i can sing to the lord myself amen and you know i don't need social media to keep up with everybody else's business i need to focus in on why i'm here some of you need to get rid of your television amen if i wasn't strong enough to pick it up and throw it and throw it towed it outside i just unplug it listen how i said it unplug it get me a pair of pliers and cut the cord on it don't do it the other way something called shock but anyway you know you you must live right clean up the house clean up your habits clean up the things of the world get rid of your cards your worldly association come on now you already know facebook is programming your mind you know they are only only they're they're putting things on there only that they want you to believe so instead of facebook face the book rates in the book start looking at the prophecy start looking at what the word of god said of you i'll tell you you'll have a happier home you know why because you won't be over there envying what somebody else has got you won't be over there looking and saying well i wish i had a husband like that or a wife like this or a car like that or or you know they didn't give me that for my birthday i don't know why i'm here but i i know i'm here because i want angels to visit us amen get rid of your worldly association get ready and then the angel of god can speak and say fear not it is i and then things take place oh when a message when an angel comes he's got a message for you and the holy spirit god's angel is here with a message for every believer keep your mind on him keep thinking about him how lovely he is how sweet he is of his promises if you're sick get this on your mind he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquity the chastisement of my peace was upon him and with his stripes i was healed keep your mind centered like that something will happen to you if you want the honor of an angel visiting your home have your home ready to visit prepared and ready under the blood of the lamb the angel lord comes to such places notice you can't walk with the world and expect god to walk with you angels won't visit you nothing else but the world because you can't mix god in the world together they will not mix god's holy s holy and separated from the world and the only thing he will ever see you is through when he looks to the blood amen now when god visits the earth by an angel and announces something by angel he has something great he's going to say he's got a message and god has sent something great and he announced it by an angel sent from the presence of god to show us once again that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and we're here in the holy ghost dispensation and this will continue on right into the end because this is um this is the apostolic age and and it it will continue on brother branham says by the administration of angels to the church truly they are ordained spirits of god sent from god to carry out things and and every man was a special calling back to the age ages angels has visited men and he said it'll it won't it won't speak of some kind of mythical something that no one understands it'll speak of jesus christ it'll testify jesus christ and it'll produce jesus christ to the world what a privilege yet we live in a day that's the most anti-christ age ever anti-anointing days of miracles have passed no such thing as the holy ghost divine healing and varus anymore no such thing as visit of angels no such things as miracles and of course when you explain all the supernatural away from the bible you take god right out of church amen you do it by your traditions and traditions of course you know are the substitutes for the word of god well god spoke to a prophet to an angel but he won't speak to you to him by an angel oh yes he will amen he absolutely will you see what it is is that our christ is coming king and satan is doing everything that he can to throw dirt on his name to keep you from believing and and you know that it's like when when jesus um or excuse me when david was a fugitive from his throne and uh was being chased by absalom and had to gather with his generals there to to fight that great fight it was a man came out and began to spit on him and i want you to remember that this is the hour that we're living in christ has been rejected from the church and men and women are spitting upon him and as they as they do you know they're they're spitting and they're saying wow you're just a bunch of holy rollers just shouting you how this this rejoicing or like little drew was doing running around around because you know that was his way of shouting in my mind you know what it's the heart of a child but you see again they throw the dirt on and said there's nothing to this divine healing there's no such thing as angels there's no such things as prophets the days of miracles are past what are they doing they're just throwing dirt on his name but i'll tell you what when he comes back them little dirt throwers are going to be weeping and wailing and nationality [Music] and we're living in the hour where he's coming back amen now a time where we're looking in the prophecy god come down walking among men revealing himself discerning the thoughts of sarah in the tent behind him all of these things using the dust of a man and of course as we've explained he could not use man in that fullness where he could step into at that time because there was no blood that could take away sin but after calvary now god uses men that he steps down into and he will use those men that he will speak through and of course this is this is what we are know that is happening in our age it's the same pillar of fire that led to israel because when jesus left from here he said i came from god and i go back to god so he returned to a pillar of fire that he had descended from now paul saw him on the road to damascus and he said that bright light he said i am jesus so now we know that jesus is not going to come here in a physical form and a nail scarred body but he will come in the power of the holy ghost the pillar of fire and every one of you who have been born again by the spirit of god had received a portion of that fire [Music] amen so he's dwelling in your body to use your flesh to give a message to this world too that he lives in fact you're the greatest sign that this world is ever going to receive in fact shall i say that the bride of christ is the last sign and when he removes this sign the judgment is to move to come now he said of angels are they not ministered spirits sent forth to minister for them that shall be heirs of salvation so i want you to notice this scripture is so true that's hebrews 1 14. angels are ministering spirits to those that are heirs of salvation so if we're heirs of salvation we're going to be recipients of ministering spirits which are angels and because they come to those who the heirs of salvation the people of the book are going to hear from minister and spirits angels have received angelic visitations now i want you to remember that when the angel appeared to brother branham it was for a specific reason it was not just to uh to just start a divine healing movement and and many many people be healed but it was that was just to that was just to attract the attention in order to get the people ready for a message so he could prove that the angel of the lord was there and the angel lord had a message we'll speak more about that message as we go along things that were revealed personally by the angel lord to us because we have a message that was administered by an angel as i say this sets us apart from all the other denominations even even from bringing from from joseph smith and the mormons it sets us apart from the mormons he had an angel but it wasn't according to the word this was a scriptural angel who revealed to us not a new book but the bible and made it a new book and the reason it made the bible a new book is because we quit looking through the lenses of the of the theologians and begin to see it through the eyes of an angel now so this this angel of god sent from jesus christ is to testify that the last days are here that's why he came he's letting you know you're in the last days little children now he gave a message as brother bradham said he said to me this message would go around the world and would start a revival don't don't let that pass over your head it would start a revival so if you're sitting dead in your sins or dead in your pew are dead in your churches and lifeless with no god there you miss the message go back and hear it again amen because this message was he said he'd send me this message we'd go around the world and start a revival amen you ought to begin with saying to god today and start that revival right here let me be the revival let me i'll just talk about a revival let me be that revival and so much that i become a messenger of this revival and this revival would sweep around the world and it'd be just before the coming of christ the second time and i hear the scoffer saying but oh that was 75 years ago that he said this and he didn't come yet and you're a skeptic and an unbeliever and you're blind because he has come he come with a shout and a prophet and brought a message the word coming to prophet that's his coming it takes flesh in and bright form so the true bride is this coming are you with me amen because he comes before he we meet him in the air and the groom coming he has to be here on the earth in bride coming so we're right here in the very middle of the coming lord don't go to sleep in this hour remember but become a part of that [Applause] coming remember the blessings from the angel is dependent on your faith in the report you must believe the report you must believe you must believe and be able to see and many people can say yeah he was in god's prophet hey we got we we got a personality cult where they they worship the personality of william branham make him infallible make him a god make him you know all kinds of things are you with me it's a personality cult they think that's all the message was god sent on a prophet it was a part of the message it wasn't part of his coming it was a phase of his coming but it's not all of his coming he's got to come in you and you and you and you and you and you the word has to become flesh a bride has to materialize on the earth whether it can be a rapture you can't rapture nothing you've got to have a people for his namesake of people whose hearts turn back to faith again a people who believe again the whole thing was dependent on if you can get people to believe not even the angel can help you if you don't believe amen there was a woman given a message and she refused to believe it she was told don't look back and the angel couldn't help her when she didn't listen she turned to pillar assault amen and she became a part she became a part of the of the ashes and the salt and the burning and the brimstone of sodom now i don't want to be a part of the brimstone of sodom and man i want to be one of those that stays with abraham that the angel of god comes to and sarah brings forth that promised son the church brings forth that promised son now again brother branham was told over again if you can get the people to believe you then nothing will stand before your prayer anything can happen if you can get the people to believe you the rapture will take place if you can get people to believe you or your heart has got to be turned or you're with me and he says now not believe me as him but leave believe that he sent me to help you i'm just his voice amen i'm just his voice by vision by looking at just like looking at anything you see now you believe it so he says now i'm just his voice that's all i am i'm his voice i'm the voice that the angel is using and you've got to believe me like i said this man would be different from others there was others with gifts there was or robert said i've got the power of god in my right hand which god's power don't dwell in anybody's hands but nevertheless he had he had a gift of healing and people were healed there was jackko a man with blind faith amen but many were healed and delivered are you with me amen but this man william branham was different from all the others because he was the voice of an angel now not in everything because he was still human he was still a man he'd still have human thoughts he could still have human assumptions he could be presumptuous and presume things he understood some things as a man and would misunderstand things but when the angel wanted to speak he would use his vocal cords it was a message administered by an angel he said he said in the south african testimony he said the age of the lord said not believe me as him but leave but believe me that he sent me and then he says now to you who believe the angel of god who has been sent to help me to help you to believe jesus christ now this is exactly what the whole message was about to get you to believing again to believe jesus christ someone say oh we're just going to go back and we're going to just leave the message and we're just going to go because we're just going to believe in jesus no you won't you believe in the jesus of methodist or baptist or pentecostal but you won't believe in the jesus of this bible because this jesus of the bible would come in the pillar of fire and he would identify a message well we'll just take the bible no you won't you'll take your interpretation of the bible you say well you you follow william branham and his interpretation no we don't we follow what the angel of god told william branham it's a message administered by an angel that come from the scripture are you with me if you can get me get the people to believe you not believe me as a man but believe the message that i'm telling you you see like sarah she believed everything that abraham reported she even believed what he told what the angel of god told hagar you know the first time the first time that the angel of god appears is to hagar that's first of all time the word angels mentioned in the bible is to hagar and and the angel goes and and says to hagar you know this is the first time that she's been thrown out of the camp and has ran because of sarah's persecution and and she's up in the bushes crying and god the angel the lord appears to her and said go back and be subject to sarah because the child in your womb will be a great nation is that right amen so you know but remember it was abraham's camp that the angel was appearing and like sarah she believed everything that abraham reported about the angel of the lord she believed that he had heard that voice there in the earl of the chaldeans and and that told him to to to walk before me and be thou perfect she believed about him being um there and revealed himself as as jehovah of jehovah um there on the at the altar and all the things that the very events that happened and how that he revealed to abraham how to offer a lamb and how to give a blood sacrifice and all the things that he taught abraham to do she believed all of that she believed that abraham was going to have a child come on amen she believed it but it wasn't personal and you can believe about jesus and you could even believe he was virgin born oh how can i even believe this you know that is that he can be virtual but i believe it you can believe you can believe that guts and a prophet you can believe he was visited by an angel you can believe that the miracles were real but it's got to become personal to you and that's the purpose of the coming of the angel was to make god personal to us a personal god i know your address i know where you live i know where i know where your location is it's 17 500 highway 371 men to louisiana amanda he could tell your address come on somebody your name your condition what the doctor said amen everything else what was it to make us aware of a supernatural gospel that this god is a god who knows every detail of our life and this is a god who even hears you when you pray when you were praying there you prayed such-and-such and such and god has answered your prayer [Music] god hears amen somebody mentioned it the other day but a little sister there was dying and then the doctors had given her up and even brother branham told her to get ready to die said look like it's going you're gonna die you know just get ready for it and he said that this little lady was there and some women had come in nurses and so on to help with situations and maybe made to clean the house and some of them was tall i don't believe in that billy branham i don't believe that an angel of god come by his way i don't believe none of that stuff i don't believe none of it and that little sister raised up you remember her name maybe it was miss weaver but anyway she she raised up she raised up and she said oh yes sir but i've been there i've seen the holy spirit move i've seen it discern hearts i've seen it healed and i believe that angel a man and a vision breaks over to brother branham and said go tell her i heard her i heard her when she stood up for the message when she stood for the truth i heard her what she said and because of that i'm sin of the healing right her way and the woman was killed of her cancer and death left her body because the angels bird that's why that's why hagar you know what would name one of the places there the lord sees and hears that was the purpose of the coming of the angel of god to make god personal to make us aware of a supernatural gospel look you're a people that whether you like it or not you're different from any other race of people i'm talking about just a natural people here on earth you're different from those that were a hundred years ago you believe in a world that they didn't know anything about you go you walk right over there to a wall and plug in a in a a vacuum cleaner or or some other kind of instrument you walk right over there and you expect it to run and to turn on and a power to come into that thing by plugging into that power you live in a realm that they knew little or nothing about maybe 150 years ago but they didn't know you're living it's an invisible round you can't even see it like i said you can feel it it'll shock you you live in a realm where that you know you have moved into a time that was once a dick tracy um uh fantasy man where you get messages on your watch word that you can speak into your watch and it goes across the world where you got a little device in your hand and you can be in real time around the world your your your people that's not natural that was natural back there this is not natural this is super natural but a man has broken into realms that has made in the invisible realm that right now my voice my image goes in real time over into africa down to india over into japan over anywhere around the world in in milliseconds time to where that it's in real time that they're watching this you know right there just as you're hearing they're hearing it and it's a world that has been previously unknown to man but now known to man might ask you a stupid question how many believes that's real every one of you believe that's real you know it's real you know now that's a real dimension that's a real world and those men that understand that you say wow right those men who can figure it out and how it works and you know how this and and knows how to troubleshoot you say wow it's a world that has been made real to you but in the same age god has used a man to bring the invisible realm of the supernatural right here and open up a world to us that was previously unknown to the church that hadn't been known about for hundreds of years thousands of years amen to where we're walking where the apostles have tried were angels appearing i send them descending visions break humans take place and my voice is speaking listen i know i was there some of you you know some of some of you say well i i don't know about all this i i say i was there i was there i i sat there you know in a pew watch brother brad and preach watch him discern the thoughts and intents of heart and i knew it was somebody besides william branham there i didn't see an angel i didn't see a light but i knew he was telling things that only god knew and he was bringing god present to me [Music] now so you see the very purpose of the coming of the angel was to make us cognate to make us realize and aware of a supernatural gospel now brother branham would say about it he says now i'm just his voice i i i could share with you a quotation where he would say you know i i've prayed and prayed and asked for uh healing and and waited for visions for for a little edith wright and she sat in a wheelchair and she suffered and i've seen god heal her and heal her of of sicknesses and and and and things but she still sit right there in that wheelchair he said now if i had anything to do with it i would heal her but i don't have anything to do with this you say well why why would god do that well i don't understand that god well i'll just tell you this much his ways is par past finding out and if he would explain it to you'd probably go over your little pea brain head anyway one day when you become immortal we'll understand things better by and by the wise and the word followers right now we just walk by faith lord you hold it all in your hand you know what's best for me and he brother bradham said in anointed ones at the end time he said you might have thought today i was trying to say something about myself that i was packing this message being i was packing this message i have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice and my voice listen this even against my better judgment i want to be a trapper in other words even against what he wanted to do and he says but it's the will of my father that i declare to do and determined to do i wasn't the one that appeared that day that down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens just as perfect as they are i'm just the one that's near when he does it some people want to come along and discredit the message say well when he was standing there that day and he was he was there on the ohio river it was his voice it said as john the baptist well what if he was that's the way god does when he prophesied through sister eileen a while ago we were talking about that was the angel's voice angel using her voice any time a prophecy comes and saying thus saith the lord it's god using a voice amen so what if it was i don't say it was i said what if it was it don't discredit nothing because why i know this man was the angel's voice amen and he said it wasn't me he said i was only the voice that i'm only the one near when he does it i was i was only a voice he used to say it i'm not the one who tells these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are he says it wasn't me what i knew it's just what i surrendered myself to that he spoke to it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it's the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was a mystery of god that unfolded it's not a man it's god the angel was not the son of man he was a messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ and he's the one you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man that's the personality i'm following now there was a great pool of bethesda this great pool was a place where maybe hundreds if not thousands gathered they were waiting for the waters to be troubled ever so often we are not told how it was that in the season the angel of god would come and trouble the water now when that when that would happen the the pool could not say look what a great water i am of all the waters i'm the greatest you see because the water had nothing to do with it it was the angel of god that came down upon the water and when the angel left it was just water again i remember the same thing with brother branham you know when the angel of god came down it was the voice of god to you he said now if i offended you by saying that forgive me but i felt it might have been resented but i am god's voice to you you say i say that again and that time was under inspiration i felt about it the first time but it repeated it now he said i can't i can say nothing in myself but when what he shows me i say it and you believe it and watch what happens see and he says now he's here at the platform it's true i don't know how to make you believe it but it's true and if you'll not look at the man your brother but if you'll look to what i'm speaking about the lord jesus his and his healing angel at the platform you believe god has angels of healings commissioned what was on the breath serpent land you think a piece of brass could heal you from the serpent bite it was the angel of god a man that was that caused him to look at that brass serpent which meant sin was judged brass being the color of judgment and he says he says um again what was the water on the pool but that's a if it wasn't an angel that came from heaven see i'm not god's gift the angel is god's gift and it came out of heaven i come from the earth and he come from heaven down in shroud and clothed an earthly vessel to speak to an earthly people that you would believe on him not on me but on him of what i'm talking about and by doing so god will heal you and that's the whole thing this is the whole point of deliverance is when you believe on what the angel said now even they testified never die did that angel ever speak but what had happened never time did he ever miss it wasn't 90 it wasn't 99 it was every time [Music] why because it was god it was jesus christ the pillar of fire speaking and he would use a human vessel to speak i see a doctor he's a big man he's got tortoise health glasses like he's he said that your cancer is incurable i see you've had one two three four five operations this is where you live this is your address you're healed you know why because all of a sudden somebody's faith got lifted up to realize this man don't know all of this so there has to be an unseen presence that knows my life and if he knows my life i know he's real and he's healed me now brother branham liking that same thing now listen you're not a prophet maybe you're not gifted in the same way but he likened it to when you get lost in the spirit he said when you're praising god it's your voice and when you get lost in the spirit praise and god see what i mean and if i would you try to use one speck of my own thoughts it'd be wrong i must have been fully on the holy spirit on the angel of god therefore i can only speak as he speaks and he can only speak if you believe it amen come on and he equates it and when you're praising god and you get lost in the spirit and begin things just begin to flow out of your mouth amen he said it's the holy spirit taking your voice amen it happens when you preach maybe you have never preached but i have and when the anointing comes and it begins to strike you begin to say things you never thought of saying revelations even come amen as if it just begins to flow from the holy ghost when god begins to take over your your vocal cords and it'll even discern hearts it'll say things to you that that only listen and confirm the word to you amen confirm the word are you with you amen it can happen there just in a little consultation sitting with a young lady and their words just come out that confirms to her the very thing that has been told to her already i believe there's a church that can praise god get lost in the spirit become the voice of the angel come on church this this man was different from oral roberts different from jack cole because every service the angel came and he would say i can do nothing till he comes you know i'm waiting on something you can tell i'm stalling here i'm waiting on him to go here he that's is amen i can't know none of you how could i do anything i can it's him and i can't do it even when he comes unless your faith operates it it isn't me i can't see vision unless your faith that does it see somebody's got to believe the report he said god's will by divine gift only thing that i i do is just keep healing myself and as i get myself completely yielded to the holy spirit then he starts talking it's not me he's using my voice but it's not me it's him now you know again this this was true even to john on the isle of patmos there the an angel came to john and revealed to john things that must sure shortly come to pass amen do you know why because john had a holy spirit filled heart now let me break something to you brother branham said angelic beings associate together so if you've got a holy spirit heart come on that the holy spirit the angel of god can reveal himself to you he can reveal healing deliverance he can reveal to you and many situations in your life and tell you exactly what to do because the angelic beings associate together he can come and appear in the church service hallelujah and faith could not heart somebody believe the report and somebody healed jump out of their pew right around the building killed by the glory of god why because angelic beings associate together i mean he's got the holy spirit today you are a welcome place for angels to associate with you don't need facebook if you got the holy spirit in you then you're a candidate for association with the unseen world and the supernatural no wonder people can't believe in those things they never come in contact they have got nothing in here to believe with but when the holy spirit comes into the heart quickly he becomes a twofold bend can you think of that a twofold bend amen one of the earth to die that's his flesh and one of heaven to live amen that's what we can say i can't die amen the body might can but i can't amen because the moment i pass this veil i'll be right in the realms of the supernatural as i tell many of them that are crossing over and i'm stepped by their bedside you know in a little bit you know it's going to get dark around you and then you'll see a light just head toward the light as you walk in that light it'll just get brighter and brighter and you'll open up until where it's full light full daylight and the next thing you'll see is a panoramic a wide open field just full of light and beautiful things and people running to you saying my precious brother i'm so glad you're here my precious sister in his body he's still subject to death but his soul is passed from death to life in his body he has earthly contact with his five senses in his spirit he has contact with god through the holy ghost and the angels of god visits them and the angel of god angels of god visits them and speaks with them and they are messengers what then you become a messenger that's why brother branham was a messenger you know they are angelic messengers from heaven but then when they come to you then you become an earthly messenger do you know every son and daughter of god is a messenger of god just as much as that angel stood there in front of abraham wrapped in human come on human body that he had spoke out from the dust and whipped together there with the 16 elements or whatever it was and rolled it together and stepped into a man and here come the angels and they stepped in the ones he created come on and three men when they got in their body they got hungry amen they appear to abraham for a little visitation and because they've got to enlighten abraham they're going to enlighten him about the end time sodom is going to burn but uh but will you save a church out of that what about my loved ones that are out there what about that lot oh they don't believe exactly what we believe and they went down to sodom but oh if i can find i will not leave one righteous one there i'll pull your loved ones out even though they gotta go through the tribulation i'm not leaving or hooked behind hallelujah remember for you abraham i'm going to reveal to you the mysteries i'm going to change your body amen you're going to bring forth the promised son oh you've had churches before you've had an hagar that gave forth the son he was not the heir of the promise and abraham in isaac shall my seed be called amen because he was the child of the promise we've had movements come up and movements come up in little ishmael movements and you know hagar gives birth and you know denominations gives birth to another wild man another eastmere light who won't be subject to the word yet god uses them for a time yet there's a purpose for them is somebody with me amen but finally the child of the promise comes and i don't care how barren this church has been how long she's been barren amen how old she is how long it's all dried up how long it's been since the spirit moved it doesn't really matter how old she is is there anything too hard for the lord he'll come amen in his power and his glory to start awakening in faith in that seat of abraham sarah suffering for the child it's going to bring forth the promised son but i'm changing her i'm causing her to believe first yeah she's believed what abraham said yes he believed it was far abram yeah jesus can do anything but now she's starting to believe all things are possible to them that believe notice he's in contact with his five senses in his spirit he has contact with god to the holy ghost the angels of god visits them speaks with them they're messengers sent from god to reveal and to bring messages from god to the individual he's out to get the first things out first notice you've got to seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness you've got to live want to just kind of put this to you you've got to live where you're conscious of the unseen world amen so you you you realize you know that that somebody can live that way just like we live today with a cell phone and we're conscious of another world and where conscience i can contact anywhere around the globe and just just milliseconds amen the unseen world through the unseen world now but we're conscious right now amen this message makes us conscious of another world i remember when you walk out here and you get in your car angels take positions beside you remember when you walk through that toward that man that's kind of unlovely and not a nice person the holy spirit's standing right above you and angels all around you the bible said the angels of god encamp about those amen they don't go back to heaven amen they camp right there amen you're worried you're you're worried because uh uh the the enemy is out to get you you're worried because uh uh unscrupulous unrighteous men trying to take even the little pennies that you got here on the earth through some lawsuits let me tell you there's angels all around you you're not in this by yourself you're not alone you're not the year i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i have no fear no evil but thou art with me hallelujah i'm comforted by your rod and your stuff because it keeps guiding me well i'm gonna get over this way to the edge or that way he's pushing me this way and he pushes me that way angels all around me keeping me from harm they don't go back to heaven they camp there they're sent on missions to watch you through life's journey why can't you see him your veil that's right you have something called the veil of the flesh now adam was made with an immortal body he could see he could see the angelic presence he could see the the pillar of fire as he come down to kiss him good night and say did my children have a good day today in eden you could see god face to face but when sin entered in and he turned from immortal to mortal then this supernatural world became blocked off to him no longer could he control the earth by the supernatural he would have to do it by the sweat of the brow and and so what keeps us from seeing god face to face is this chur in this church this morning is the veil it keeps us from seeing angels in their position and when the angels are there standing by their seats by your seat if you could just see in the in the supernatural realm there are as i said they're angels they're dropping to you handfuls on purpose ministering angels ministered spirits lifting up your spirit causing you to you know lift up that heavy depression off of you causing you to believe amen and then it's there but it's the veil this flesh is what keeps us from seeing him and we're you know we're sons and daughters of god we're in the presence of god the angels are camped about us and they i said i'll never leave you or forsake you is that right listen church this is what he said he said i'll never leave you or forsake you that's his promise do you believe that let me look here for a scripture just for a moment i'll tell you what i i'm almost positive i know where i'm at here but hang on just for a minute yeah all right we know hebrews 13 8 let's look at hebrews 13 5. let the way you live be without covetousness that's what it means conversation let the way you live be without covetousness you know quit desiring to be have all the luxuries of laodicea amen and be content with such things as you have for he has said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee amen so that you may boldly say the lord is my helper and i will not fear what men shall do to me amen oh hallelujah next verse amen remember them which have the rule over you that have spoken to you the word of god whose faith follow consider the end of their conversation the way they live jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever and what does he say i won't leave you [Music] you know that's a mistaken thing that people think you know yes you can be in a justified condition grievous holy spirit away you know you can you know pick up things that doesn't belong to you steal or do things wrong or in the sanctified condition but once he filled you with the holy ghost he sealed you to the day of redemption he does not come and go he does not get breathed away from you he is always there i will never leave you or forsake you hallelujah i'll be there with you all the way to the end but it's our flesh that keeps us out of his presence amen remember the boy the servant with elijah or elijah rather when he when they were all surrounded by this by the syrians down in samaria and you know the the young young servant looked out and said man all i can see is the syrians all around where where there's no way out that may be the way you see it this morning you see yourself surrounded amen but i may feel like i'm surrounded but i'm surrounded by you come on come on i may feel like i'm surrounded i may feel like there's devils everywhere i may feel like i've been satan's even in the last the worst things that there was i may feel surrounded but i'm surrounded by you i just need my eyes open to see that he's here jesus christ to say yesterday today and forever never read it and the veil dropped out for the old boy's eyes he saw horses of fire and chariots of fire see the veil dropped amen the veil keeps us from doing what we really want to do you battle it out with your own flesh god came in veil in the veil of flesh and there calvary rent the veil into and god became god again and he raised up from that veil that he'd hid himself in somebody with me amen and remember remember that day whenever it'll be we don't know when it'll be but at the coming of the lord jesus now his coming might be today for you he may not wait till we all go he may come for you today before you get out of this building or as you're driving down the road you don't know when he's coming but he's coming amen and at the coming of jesus the lord jesus the veil will be dropped amen and and you you will walk and talk with him your lord and savior and then you know there when he takes the throne of david will live for him forever in a perfected veil hallelujah but this veil has sin in it i don't ever think that we're perfected we're perfect in this amen but i tell you what we do have something going on we have the holy spirit in here that keeps bringing this thing in check subject to the word of god and every time we would do wrong he brings to the word to our remembrance brings us to repentance and straightens up our lives he don't let us live and sin amen aren't you glad for that amen hallelujah now the bible speaks of heavenly places that's what this is is where angels are all around where that the presence of god is it's heavenly places it's places that you cannot know about till you're born again beast nature cannot know about this amen but when you're born again you're you become a candidate for association with an unseen world and angels become visible they begin to appear to you and then you begin to feel their presence you know your cognitive there's something going on here hey man you walk into a church like this and you say this is heavenly places and it just feels different from anywhere else and that's the way a church ought to be it ought to be a place where a sinner comes in and wreaks his way to calgary you want to be with a sick country and say there's a living god in this place and that god can heal all diseases because an atmosphere is created by heavenly angels coming in because of the saints of god and they recognize his presence and become vices of that angel this is where he speaks of heavenly places ephesians 1 3 is blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ ephesians 2 6 he's raised us up together made us to sit together in heavenly places amen these heavenly places is where angels are amen i'm telling you we're here amen we're here we're heavenly places amen with the where the spirit of god is ascending and descending on the son of man come on the son of man is here in bright form amen as christ and his people christ in his church amen there he is ascending and descending bringing messages from heaven that is telling you yes you can overcome yes you can rise above that yes you can be healed yes you can be saved yes your children will not be lost forever yes yes yes yes because the word of god to you is yes am amen yes and amen yes and amen hallelujah heavenly places brother brethren said can't you feel that friend that heavenly atmosphere around the people now angels of god mingling around hallelujah hallelujah oh my angels have set down their camps along the side of this place it's written the angels of guarding camp about those and then the great unseen world that is now around us stern our emotions to repentance and to bring evil before our eyes that we have done wrong in other words convincing us from sin you know that's the work of the holy ghost the holy ghost will not let you live and sin it will convince you of sin it will tell you that's wrong where you can turn from it and walk right it'll put a power in you an overcoming power [Applause] [Music] angels of god and that great unseen world is now around us stirring our emotions through repentance amen to bring evil before our eyes that we've done wrong with tentative hearts we surrendered our evil ways lord and ask for divine mercy hallelujah amen there's a world right here now in this building are legions of angels jesus was cognitive that he said you know i i could call 12 legions of angels that's 80 000 angels and they would all come and they would be at my beating amen that was the first of this new race the head of this new race the new creation and every child that is born in that new creation can call legions of angels to come to their side amen to give them fruits in their hour of need he said if you can just worship god and open our eyes you'll find god is all around us there's another world you don't have to leave very far it's right with you it's right around you amen it's more real than these five senses amen you'll find out you'll find out one day i mean you'll find out you know what's been around you all the time amen one day you'll step beyond this veil and then you'll see angels that you never knew was there you never recognized you you thought all this time you were alone you were never alone child i'll never leave you fighting alone i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world it's what he's trying to get down to your heart this morning brother branham said you know he said for for instance he said there's this other world he said now god gave you five senses and he says let's say that you didn't get your sense of sight so you got you got smell and hearing and you know those things one time sometimes will help compensate and whatever else for their mothers and you know like the blind man that was feeling brother brandon's face oh you're a young man and you're you know this and he says you know but like you didn't get your sense of sight and then you would bump into things and as you bumped into them you you know you you know you you have some ideas you feel around of what do what it is and you hear maybe you never also hear people saying things and you just have to have take their word for it they say it's blue you have no conception of blue they say it's green you don't know what green is but you learn well grass is green skies are blue but you don't know it somebody told you that and so you know you have this senses that your senses um can declare but you know you you don't understand everything and and that's kind of the way that it is when you were born into this world you were born with your sense of faith blinded and that sense it's the sixth sense that that actually opens up the world of the unseen that you're blind to and you don't understand it now because you're bumping into it amen because you don't have that sense you you can say i feel a strange feeling like somebody like a blind man you can't see the light of day he can't tell darkness from light he can look straight into the sun and there is absolutely no light rays that gives him any any sight whatsoever he's blind but he can walk out into that sunlight and all of a sudden he feels something warm are you with me amen he feels something warm and and he says uh i i just walked out into the sunlight the sun is shining here now he's never seen the sun he don't know what light is but he's heard about it amen now he can feel it but he can't tell it's full dimensions and you don't understand it all yet either come on now amen but because you're bumping into it you you haven't got that sense you can say i feel a strange feeling in this place am i just want to cry or shout or something it's the angels of the lord hallelujah amen it is just as real as that sunlight is to that mind man i feel something there's something going on in this place it's the angel of god passing by let me reach out and talk to you hallelujah amen we're sitting here in heavenly places because the holy spirit is here now christ is here amen and when when we step out of this body we'll step into a body going to another dimension and leaving this physical body going right into a body amen that has full sight brother brandon said they could we could see things there that that you that you can't see with the natural eye he said that we knew things they knew things there that we didn't know here amen because he said if people could get an idea of it he said right now angels are walking up and down these aisles of christ the son of god moving around to this building you are in his presence [Music] angels all around me to keep me from harm angels all around me i feel no alarm ain't my angels all around me amen we're in the atmosphere of angels we're an atmosphere where all things are possible to them that believe with atmosphere where a message can come from glory and stir our soul and change our lives an unseen world is greater than anything you can see amen brother brandon said in this room right now this building our evil spirits and war why he said the angels god are encamped about and christians are anointed and and and trying to energize them with faith amen and i'm here standing just yielding myself and the holy spirit's moving this is what you call heavenly places in christ jesus but remember satan's always skeptic amen you know he always does that somebody with a skeptic idea when they do that he's just trying to interfere but he said christians always overcome hallelujah you overcame your unbelief to receive christ you i've got to overcome unbelief to receive healing and you overcome unbelief to receive the message from god satan's always skeptic amen amen said there's an atmosphere by which we could live in forever this humble feeling angels walking up and down the aisles all around these posts around in this tent on the outside angels of god are moving their great wings spread and this is what you makes you feel that way you don't feel like this all the time you don't see nothing but you're different from what you were when you walked in a while ago i feel it i'm conscious of it amen remember what it was it was just jesus here in the form of the pillar of fire the angel of the covenant he can't come in the body the fleshly body that was glorified of jesus christ it sits there on the throne of grace let me tell you around the world it's a throne of mercy oh man it's a throne of grace and mercy you said mercy's over it is for you because you believe that amen but it's not for us because we don't believe that and because we believe we got mercy because we believe we got drinks hallelujah because we believe that sinners can weave their way to calgary because we believe that mercy can be found at the altar and people receive the holy ghost because we believe that hallelujah that in this field and his angels have mercy bringing mercy to the lost message to sick mercy to the depressed mercy hallelujah what form is jesus in among us now a light the same pillar of fire that he was at the beginning amen he's here with us but i want you to know in these heavenly places oh i don't know i'm on overtime gear right now amen i'm in overtime gear hang on just a minute he hadn't said quit yet amen i just preached because he says quit amen heavenly places is where spiritual warfare where spiritual war prayers take place and even right now you are in a warfare i mean you'll feel the tug of the holy spirit the tithe of the enemy that comes to the holy spirit and the tug of the enemy it depends on which one you're going to believe [Applause] you yield to the holy ghost the bible said we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of darkness in this world against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places [Applause] that's where we're at when you have this there's a war starts happening amen brother branham said if the angel of the lord will come near then the angel of sickness that is would be on you he'll go to pulling you realize if you can just open your eyes you can see that ain't god that gave you that sickness that sickness is not from the lord it's a tormentor from the pits of hell [Applause] and the church has been given the power to cast it out in my name they shall cast their outdoors amen they will heal the sick come on now that's the word the angel of the lord will come near then the angel of sickness which would be on you he'll go to poland and he said the angel lord is near now there's both powers and they're fighting once against the other and it depends on our faith now that sickness whatever you have it that's pulling on you it's going to try to put everything in your mind to keep you from believing that this is the truth and this which is coming now and me speaking to you is trying to get you to believe that it's the truth come on now oh man you got these over here this liberal out he's blasting with your ears with all of the social media and all the news this way and god's got some good news over on this side and he's blowing back this way hallelujah he says i've raised men up and i put man down all powers of god are ordained of god they ain't a president can get in office unless that god ordained them to be there and they ain't enough devils and they ain't even not conservative they ain't enough distance or that one that can keep the evil man from coming in that's got to do his deed god's word said a vision said we'd have a woman vice president she'd be president or vice president by a vice president or president or it could be a catholic church and it is mr biden's catholic and then here's her and she's a vice president and they're not intended on him living through did you hear me i said they are not intended on him living through we're here we're in division we are in the vision before the before that the rat strikes the earth there's a bride in the prison hallelujah come on we've already been seen in the mission brother brandon would say i saw a preview of the pride she was walking sweetly in tune and my own were christian soldier you remember it's never backwards it's always following always i'm gonna keep going don't turn around don't turn back you're not twice keep going on sarah keep walking in the vision you're gonna be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye there ain't nothing out of order it's the light pressing back to darkness and the dark is getting darker but the light is getting brighter amen and i say to you children of the king amen move toward that light keep moving for that light it will break into a perfect day [Applause] hallelujah now that sickness whatever you have that that's pulling on you it's gonna try to put everything in your mind to keep from you to believing that this is the truth and this which is coming out it means speaking to you it's trying to get you to believe that it's the truth now here's the warfare if you believe it then this year the holy spirit would pronounce the blessing and satan has to leave oh hallelujah i remember when he pronounced the blessing on my life and i changed from darkness to light i remember a sick boy he killed me and he pronounced him blessing on my life oh i know he pronounced the blessing on this church with victory after victory give me a series of victories hallelujah what you see no matter to what's coming hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the lord why don't you just praise him just giving thanks just a minute glorifies me [Applause] [Music] the spirit of god has made me and the breath of the almighty has given me life let your breath blow across this building lord hallelujah thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus at the angel take your voice right now praise the name of the lord amen amen amen let you be seated a minute now hallelujah how many can say lord i believe forgive me of my unbelief help me to believe with all my heart brother branham in his sermon he was looked out at an elderly lady that was all crippled up he said they were she was the last one of the wheelchairs that had not been emptied out in the building and she was weeping and crying she's sitting there uh night after night weeping and crying and he said i see what her trouble was and and what started it but instead of her accepting enough faith she would think oh i'm too bad and it would move up again now i want you to notice the angel of the lord would come actually come down upon her produce a vision but then she would think oh but i'm too bad now remember i told you it's a war but he's got to get you to believe him on somebody because when you believe the blessing comes the healing comes the deliverance comes [Applause] hallelujah hey man she was you know she said i'm too bad you know maybe she thought her case was too difficult you know her her condition was too terrible she could never walk she could never get well she could never be whole again you may be sitting here in the angel of god but i can never but i could never i could never be forgiven i could never forgive myself i could never forgive that person i could never i got too bad [Music] amen you could be sitting there i'm unworthy maybe that's what you meant i'm too bad i'm unworthy i'm not good enough amen it isn't that at all it's given on you believing if we can get you to believe hallelujah amen the angel of god would settle down upon her she would think oh i'm too bad i'm not good enough what was it it was pushing the angel back away from her but in the last moments after brother branham was through through with the prayer lines walking out of the church hey man that there's there he spoke to her two or three times trying to get her faith up to a level to believe and she just couldn't get it she just couldn't get it but all of a sudden there she felt something that was real warm and tingling go through her body and she got him out of her wheelchair and started pushing her wheelchair around the building time you start pushing that cancer stop pushing that signal that puts in that habit raise them out of that and start pushing it it puts me around mostly i've been pushed around in this whole chair long enough but it's time that i start pushing it's time to turn and start pushing back we're not going to let the devil have any leeway witness anymore we're sons and daughters of god i feel the atmosphere around me i feel the holy ghost in this turn and i feel the people pushing back pushing back and pushing back he said the angels of god are camped about those that fear there's a dark shadow between you and and that angel that wants to help you bring in the message of christ that's unbelief now if you can get that unbelief that dark shadow you'll see plainly then you'll raise and rejoice and go home shouting and praising god don't let that shadow stand between you [Music] hallelujah amen don't let that shadow stand between you oh no promise is mine jesus paid for it amen it's just yielding yourself to him and your own faith touches and brings brings him and brings out whatever god wants to say it's not me i'm not a healer it's god and your individual faith in god you shut up your compassion and say you don't believe it and nothing will happen but open your heart and say god i'm ready to believe it then watch what happened brother branham told us this was a contest amen and there it was like a two teams and they're you know they're there there's there's a devil on one end there's a fire in between you and you're on the other end of the rope and he's trying to pull you into the into the fire there's a contest a warfare that is going on he said god in the church becomes its truth to pull satan into his own fires that he is made and the tubs goes on and jesus said in mark 16 then my name they shall cast out devils i'm talking about a church that's able to pull satan right into the fires that he's trying to pull you into hallelujah oh my goodness there's so many of these things but let me tell you something church what do you think happens when a sinner comes to christ there's a war goes on he's saying you know i can just be a good boy and just keep on i don't have to surrender to christ there's a war going on and the gospel is going on to say it's for you it's for you will you believe in the devil sitting there and saying now oh it's not for you and nothing ever happened to you and you went up and then god doesn't care for you and you didn't cross the line and all these other lies that the devil wants to tell are you with me amen but you know what happens when a sinner comes to christ hallelujah amen brother branham told us he said that the devil satan goes back with his black flags draping and he goes back to hell and he said i lost again i'm lost again i thought i had it i thought i could hold it i'll tell you we need to make the black friends of satan break this morning let it drag down to the gates of hell and then by the white crimes of angels are rejoicing in heaven and for the friends and even even the mothers and the daddies that's going on and are waiting on the other side they hear the message coming back from the altar your child came home your child came home [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you remember you remember timothy when the devil had to go back like a scalded dog with his black draping i thought i had this boy i tatted him up i pulled him down in the world i made him drinking smoke i made him corrals around i made him i thought i could make something out of it but in one moment one moment in the presence of the angel it transformed his life forever that's what he did for you this morning i tell you friends we we are not just winning the battle we are winning this war we are gonna win this war we've had victory and we've had victory and we've got victory but we're gonna have more that have distribute victory we'll win in this world we're winning this war greater is he that is in you than he that is the world because the angels of god didn't care about those that fear him and delivers them are you ready for your deliverance this morning hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus worship him now he's worshiping amen let him use your voice right now hallelujah let the musicians come come on i can't preach anymore [Music] hallelujah thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus ministered spirits sent from the throne of god ministering to those that are heirs of salvation blessed be the name of

holy spirit this morning let him do that work in your life hallelujah thank you jesus thank you jesus right now while the angel is here i want you to reach out to him right now right now you out there in real time wherever you are delayed time in the archives we're listening to this it doesn't really matter it's never too late he's right here for you satan you've lost [Music] i hear a prophet of god saying there's a church rising and satan be careful and i tell you you got a reason to be careful there's some people believing right now that's going to cast you out you have no more dominion over their lives you can't hold them any longer and this bride she will do exploits because she's called of god to do so now in the name of jesus christ i find every spirit that is working against the body of christ in jesus name i send it even to the copy patients in the hospital gasping their last breath may that last breath be the breath of the holy ghost that enters in them floods their lungs with healing power in jesus name may it do the same thing to the church amen may the holy spirit do its work right now and bring life into the body in jesus name [Music] amen [Music] hallelujah
