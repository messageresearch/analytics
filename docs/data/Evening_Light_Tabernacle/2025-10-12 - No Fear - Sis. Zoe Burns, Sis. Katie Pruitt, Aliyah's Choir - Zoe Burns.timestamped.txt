[0:22] I got enemies on every side. Ain't
[0:25] looking good. I ain't going to
[0:26] [music and singing] lie. Arrows flying,
[0:28] devils trying to make me think I'm going
[0:31] down this time. [music] You might think
[0:33] that I'd be afraid. Running scared with
[0:36] a shaking faith, but the God I know says
[0:39] it ain't over. The God I [singing] know
[0:41] is going to make a way. [music]
[0:44] Yay.
[0:46] Though I walk [singing]
[0:49] through the valley,
[0:52] I [singing] will have no fear. No
[0:56] [music] fear, no fear.

[1:24] [singing] life. I don't mind. No fear
[1:27] when [music] I'm walking through the
[1:28] fire cuz I know you're walking right
[1:31] through. No fear when the blood rise by
[1:35] my eyes [singing] on you. No fear.
[1:38] [music]
[1:38] No fear. No fear. [singing]
