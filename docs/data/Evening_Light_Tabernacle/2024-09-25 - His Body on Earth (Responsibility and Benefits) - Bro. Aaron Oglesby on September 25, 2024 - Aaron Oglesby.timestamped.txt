[43:06] look at uh what we're going to look at
[43:08] tonight if I give it a title is his body
[43:11] on Earth responsibility and benefits his
[43:15] body on Earth responsibility and
[43:18] benefits and what I want us to look at
[43:20] is as the bride of Christ tonight we
[43:22] have a great
[43:23] responsibility but with that comes great
[43:26] benefits amen so let's just look at uh
[43:29] Psalms 103 and verse 2 it says bless the
[43:32] Lord oh my soul and forget not all his
[43:37] benefits who forgiveth all thine
[43:39] iniquities who Health all thy diseases
[43:43] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[43:45] who crowneth thee with loving kindness
[43:48] and Tender Mercies who satisfieth thy
[43:51] mouth with good things so that thy youth
[43:54] is renewed like the eagle amen let's
[43:58] also look together in Mark 16 we're
[44:00] going to read Mark 161 17 and
[44:04] 18 while we're still standing Mark 16
[44:07] verse1 17 very familiar scripture this
[44:10] is where brother brandham would say that
[44:12] that the true church is Mark 16 in
[44:14] action he said all else is false it has
[44:17] to be says and these signs shall follow
[44:20] them that believe in my name shall they
[44:23] cast out Devils they shall speak with
[44:25] new tongues they shall take up servant
[44:28] serpents and if they drink any deadly
[44:30] thing it shall not hurt them they shall
[44:33] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[44:36] recover amen I pray the Lord will add a
[44:38] blessing to the reading of the word as
[44:40] you have your seats even right there in
[44:42] our reading how how awesome is it that
[44:44] we can see some of his benefits and he's
[44:46] he's telling us not to forget him and he
[44:48] says he says he forgives all thine
[44:50] iniquities he he heals all thy diseases
[44:54] he says he redeemeth thyy life from
[44:55] destruction he crowneth thee with loving
[44:58] kindness and Tender Mercies and in in in
[45:01] The Book of Mark he he talks about
[45:03] taking up serpents he speaks of the
[45:05] protection that we'll have and and the
[45:06] healing that we'll have and how that
[45:08] we'll have the ability to recover and
[45:10] and I just want to stop and say for a
[45:12] minute what what a wonderful gospel has
[45:14] been given to us amen and and it's
[45:17] always been wonderful and it's always
[45:19] been powerful and yet we know that down
[45:22] through the church ages much of it had
[45:24] been lost much of it had had had been
[45:27] covered over and hidden and lost and and
[45:29] the church was attacked and persecuted
[45:32] and we know that the false Vine got in
[45:34] and and intertwined itself with the True
[45:36] Vine and and doctrines were changed and
[45:39] things were added and and and other
[45:41] truths were taken out and lost and and
[45:43] so there was this long dark period of
[45:46] time where the power of God wasn't able
[45:49] to operate in its fullness it's not that
[45:52] it didn't operate but it didn't operate
[45:54] in its fullness like like what we have
[45:56] today it was it was a time where there
[45:58] were glimmers of Truth and it was small
[46:01] pieces partial realizations brother
[46:03] Brandon would say and it was a time
[46:05] where men were were probing at the truth
[46:08] and and and you know Through the Ages
[46:10] there were great men with great ideas
[46:12] there were well studied men who spent
[46:14] hours in the scriptures doing their best
[46:17] to understand amen and and many of these
[46:20] ideas as we find studying the message
[46:22] many of them were right and many others
[46:26] were wrong or else they were partial
[46:28] truth or or they were mixed maybe with
[46:30] ideas of Catholicism but the scri the
[46:33] scripture had promised a full
[46:36] restoration amen the scripture had
[46:38] promised Elijah and and it said that
[46:40] Elijah would come and turn our hearts
[46:42] back to the faith again and the
[46:44] scripture promised that there would come
[46:45] a day when the mysteries of God would be
[46:48] finished amen and I believe that we can
[46:51] say tonight assuredly that Elijah has
[46:53] come and I believe we can say tonight
[46:55] that the Mysteries have been finished
[46:57] and I believe we can say tonight by by
[46:59] looking around us that there has been a
[47:01] people whose heart has been turned back
[47:04] to the original Faith back to the
[47:06] original word I I believe these
[47:08] scriptures today have been fulfilled
[47:11] amen the the Mysteries have all been
[47:13] made known and and and and there are
[47:17] there there are people whose Hearts have
[47:18] been turned back and although we we
[47:21] stand now in the darkest of all ages I
[47:23] I'm glad to say tonight that we have
[47:26] light amen yes it's dark all around us
[47:28] but we have light and one thing about
[47:31] light is it's undeniable in
[47:34] darkness and as you go on your testimony
[47:37] your life it shines greater day by day
[47:41] by day the darker the world gets the
[47:43] lighter and brighter your light shines
[47:46] amen because you can't hide light in
[47:49] darkness I think I think we're up and
[47:51] running now I'll just leave it right
[47:53] there for a minute amen your light
[47:55] shines brighter and and and we see even
[47:58] you can see a parallel to this time
[48:00] there in Exodus 10 in in in in Egypt
[48:03] when the ninth plague was darkness and
[48:05] it said that it was so dark that it
[48:07] could be felt it was so dark that it
[48:10] could be felt but Israel had light amen
[48:14] that that's our type tonight we we we
[48:16] see clearly in the scripture that the
[48:19] the truth of water baptism how because
[48:21] we have light in this day we we see
[48:23] clearly the truth of of the sin in the
[48:26] garden how we have that because we have
[48:28] light in this day we see the truth of
[48:31] the godhead we we see the truth of the
[48:33] real baptism of the Holy Ghost we see
[48:35] the truth of Divine Healing we see the
[48:37] truth of Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ is the
[48:41] same yesterday today and forever brother
[48:44] Brandon would say that's the Cornerstone
[48:46] of the Bible the Revelation that Jesus
[48:49] Christ does not change I'm thankful
[48:51] tonight to know he doesn't change where
[48:53] he stood yesterday he stands today where
[48:56] he healed yesterday he heals today where
[48:58] he saved yesterday he saves today
[49:02] amen amen and we rejoice in that light
[49:06] we're not wandering around in darkness
[49:08] you you see the result of people
[49:10] wandering around in darkness look at the
[49:12] insanity that's from people wandering
[49:14] with no light but we can Rejoice tonight
[49:17] because we're not wandering around in
[49:19] darkness we're not blind to the event to
[49:21] the events that are happening all around
[49:23] us these modern events going on brother
[49:26] Joe had been made clear by prophecy amen
[49:29] so we have light tonight and we're
[49:31] thankful for that we're we're not
[49:32] guessing at what is true we're not
[49:34] guessing at what is false a prophet was
[49:37] able to come in this day and and sort
[49:39] through the thoughts of men from Days
[49:41] Gone By he was able to sort th through
[49:45] those things and say this was right yeah
[49:48] this was wrong this is a truth that you
[49:51] can hold on to this right here needs to
[49:54] be done away with it's a claim against
[49:55] the church that's a false baptism that
[49:58] has to be done away with you sometimes
[50:00] people like to point out brother Joe
[50:02] well you know brother Brandon wasn't the
[50:04] first person to teach this so and so
[50:06] taught this back in the well yeah it was
[50:08] a message of
[50:09] restoration it was a restoration of
[50:11] Truth it had all been taught
[50:14] before all of it it was a
[50:18] restoration well so and so it already
[50:21] taught something similar to this yes but
[50:23] now because of the authority of a
[50:25] prophet even though it was told in 18
[50:27] whenever I can look back and go I know
[50:30] that's true because a Vindicated Prophet
[50:32] said it's true otherwise it's just a
[50:35] guess like all the other ones but a
[50:36] Vindicated Prophet came and said truth
[50:39] truth truth error truth truth truth
[50:41] error error error truth and what was his
[50:43] job to tie up all the Loose Ends and he
[50:46] did it and he presented us with a
[50:48] glorious message in this day and because
[50:51] of it we have
[50:53] light amen so we stand today with a
[50:57] restored word and with the restored word
[51:00] comes restored power amen we have a
[51:03] restored power we're a body of Believers
[51:06] today standing on the earth with the
[51:08] fullness of the
[51:12] word brother Bram
[51:14] says the people of God are being made
[51:17] ready by the word of truth from the
[51:19] messenger of this age in her that's us
[51:24] will be the fullness of the of Pentecost
[51:27] for the spirit will bring the people
[51:29] right back to where they were at the
[51:31] beginning that's thus saith the
[51:35] Lord so we are the
[51:39] beneficiaries we're talking about
[51:41] benefits tonight we are the
[51:43] beneficiaries of the greatest message
[51:45] that has ever hit the face of the Earth
[51:48] brother Brown says in the days of the
[51:49] seventh messenger in the days of the
[51:51] leosan age its Messenger will reveal the
[51:54] mysteries of God as revealed to Paul
[51:57] remember he changes not as revealed to
[52:00] Paul he will speak out and those who
[52:02] receive the prophet in his own name will
[52:04] receive the beneficient effect of that
[52:07] prophet's Ministry how many's received
[52:10] the benefits of the prophet's ministry
[52:11] tonight amen and they that hear him will
[52:14] be blessed I can say that's the truth
[52:16] amen and become part of that Bride of
[52:19] the last day who are mentioned in
[52:20] Revelation 22:17 the spirit and the
[52:23] bride say come I'm going to say right
[52:25] now if if receiving the benefits part is
[52:27] true and we can say Amen a and receiving
[52:30] a blessing part is true and we can say
[52:32] Amen then I'm going to go ahead and say
[52:33] Amen to the part that says we are a part
[52:36] of the last day bride standing on the
[52:38] earth mentioned in Revelation
[52:40] 22:17 and I want to put my voice with
[52:43] those and say come tonight all who are
[52:46] thirsty come all who are desperate come
[52:49] if you're sick tonight come if you're
[52:50] hurting tonight come and drink of the
[52:52] Water of Life freely
[52:54] amen we have been fitted from this
[52:57] message beyond
[52:58] words we have seen God move in our midst
[53:02] we've seen him save and heal and deliver
[53:06] we we we receive the the the the
[53:07] greatest of
[53:09] treasures I want to Echo the scripture
[53:11] hold fast that which thou Hast don't let
[53:14] it become common to you this is a great
[53:17] treasure that's been given to us in this
[53:19] day and it's all ours to
[53:22] enjoy
[53:24] Hallelujah as his body we have many
[53:26] great benefits and as his body we also
[53:29] have many great
[53:33] responsibilities and in lots of ways
[53:35] that they go hand in hand and I just
[53:36] want to use this as an example tonight
[53:39] as I looked at it I had to cut so much
[53:41] out because there's so many benefits you
[53:43] can't talk about them all there's really
[53:45] so many responsibilities you can't talk
[53:47] about them all so we just pick a few to
[53:49] kind of make our point
[53:51] tonight because they go together because
[53:54] healing is a benefit that we have as
[53:57] children of
[53:58] God but it's also a responsibility of us
[54:02] in this last day to preach Divine
[54:04] Healing and to stand for Divine Healing
[54:07] in the face of a church world that would
[54:09] say that's for days gone by but by
[54:11] standing for the truth of Divine Healing
[54:14] and believing when others don't believe
[54:16] we reap the benefits from the truth that
[54:19] we stand for amen so it goes together by
[54:22] fulfilling your responsibility you reap
[54:25] the benefits of that responsibility amen
[54:29] we we we benefit from it every role in
[54:31] life is this way in in a home the
[54:33] children have certain responsibilities
[54:36] and they have certain benefits the
[54:38] husband has certain responsibilities
[54:39] certain benefits it's the same in the
[54:41] family of God but usually what you'll
[54:44] find is the less
[54:47] responsibility the less
[54:50] benefits so I'm not shying away today
[54:52] from the fact that he's called us to
[54:55] fulfill all that needs to be fulfilled
[54:58] that he's called us to be the final
[54:59] voice to the final age you say oh that
[55:02] that's a great responsibility it sure is
[55:04] but it comes with great benefits tonight
[55:08] he he he's not going to leave us here
[55:10] struggling and barely getting by he says
[55:12] no I'm going to drop you handfuls on
[55:14] purpose I'm going to take care of you
[55:16] I'm going to heal your sick I'm going to
[55:17] save your children I'm going to bring
[55:19] the Lost back in I'm going to deliver
[55:21] the bound because with that
[55:23] responsibility comes great benefits
[55:25] tonight amen amen in a church service we
[55:29] have a
[55:30] responsibility to create the right
[55:32] atmosphere whenever we come together in
[55:35] the house of God that's right sometimes
[55:37] we don't want
[55:39] to maybe I'll just speak for me maybe
[55:41] y'all show up every time and you are
[55:43] just woohoo yes sir but
[55:52] Joe I'll speak for
[55:55] me sometimes we don't want to sometimes
[55:58] we don't feel like
[55:59] it sometimes our carnality gets in the
[56:03] way but it's our
[56:08] responsibility he says let's believe one
[56:11] place one Accord get the atmosphere
[56:13] right be expecting and God will fill us
[56:16] with the Holy Ghost and send down
[56:19] Powers let's break up the atmosphere and
[56:22] get the atmosphere in a Heavenly worship
[56:25] get the atmosphere right Eagles will be
[56:27] born out of any church anywhere well I
[56:32] don't understand why people ain't being
[56:33] born again in our church get the
[56:35] atmosphere right welcome the Holy Spirit
[56:38] he says get the atmosphere right and
[56:39] Eagles will be born out of any church
[56:42] anywhere I say it's our responsibility
[56:45] to get the atmosphere right but when we
[56:47] do it welcomes him and he comes down and
[56:50] we reap the benefits of fulfilling our
[56:54] responsibility amen
[56:58] Hallelujah he said the same thing about
[57:00] the day of Pentecost he said they had to
[57:02] get the atmosphere right and then there
[57:04] came a sound from heaven we when we want
[57:07] God to move well let's get the
[57:08] atmosphere right let's fulfill our
[57:12] responsibility and then he'll come by
[57:14] and we will reap the benefits of it and
[57:17] I think it's wonderful that everything
[57:19] he does and everything he asked us to do
[57:22] there are benefits that comes with it
[57:25] amen and we as his bride are the
[57:27] beneficiaries of All His blessings we're
[57:30] the beneficiaries of a restored word the
[57:32] beneficiaries of healing the
[57:34] beneficiaries of forgiveness Amen in
[57:36] fulfilling what the word has called us
[57:39] to do then we receive the benefits of
[57:43] that
[57:44] word and because of the age and because
[57:47] of of restoration and because of the
[57:49] fullness that has been restored to us we
[57:53] have the privilege of operating at a
[57:55] higher level than any other
[57:58] age but we also have a greater
[58:01] responsibility than any other
[58:05] age Luke 12:48 tells us says but he that
[58:10] knew not and did commit things worthy of
[58:12] Stripes shall be beaten with you stripes
[58:15] for unto whomever much is given of him
[58:19] shall much be required and to whom men
[58:22] have committed much of him they will ask
[58:25] more Church there's been a lot committed
[58:27] to us in this day the entire opening of
[58:30] the word the opening of the seals the
[58:32] Mysteries revealed all the truth brought
[58:34] back into one place and handed to
[58:37] you and because of that much is required
[58:39] there's great responsibility brother BR
[58:42] says now God as the light has begin to
[58:44] shine in the last days he is expecting
[58:47] us a great thing from us because where
[58:51] there is much given there is much
[58:53] required so he's going to require much
[58:55] more of us than he did of the lutherans
[58:58] or the methodists because we walk in a
[59:00] greater light with a greater power with
[59:03] a greater witness than they had now we
[59:06] have a greater witness of the
[59:08] Resurrection we have things more firm
[59:11] more sure than they had more has been
[59:14] given to us than any other age and more
[59:17] is required of us than any other age
[59:21] every other age had a part to fulfill
[59:23] and yet in this age brother Joe our part
[59:27] is all of
[59:28] it well this age had to fulfill this
[59:31] part and and this age had to fulfill
[59:33] this part and he says you I want you to
[59:36] fulfill all of it but don't worry I'm
[59:40] going to give you everything you need in
[59:42] order to do it God never asked you to do
[59:45] anything without providing what you have
[59:47] need to do it he says when I return will
[59:51] I find faith and then he sends a message
[59:53] to turn the hearts to make sure the
[59:55] faith is there that he's looking for
[59:57] that's how he operates he don't send you
[1:00:00] without providing the provisions that
[1:00:01] you need in order to make it amen what's
[1:00:06] he want us to do he wants us to fulfill
[1:00:08] everything that's been left for us he
[1:00:10] wants us to finish the work of Christ he
[1:00:12] wants us to manifest Jesus to a Dying
[1:00:15] World and we have a great responsibility
[1:00:17] as the body here on Earth but in
[1:00:20] fulfilling all that he has called us
[1:00:21] fulfilled we are the ones who will reap
[1:00:24] those benefits he says the church is
[1:00:27] ready she's sealed in ready to come
[1:00:29] there will be a big outpouring of the
[1:00:31] spirit yes sir to grab that church and
[1:00:33] take her into the skies exactly because
[1:00:35] see the church the word the bride and
[1:00:38] Christ his ministry is in the bride
[1:00:40] which is his body the celestial body or
[1:00:43] I mean to say the supernatural body of
[1:00:45] his here on the spiritual body on Earth
[1:00:47] his spirit is in there living his life
[1:00:50] right out until him and the church
[1:00:53] become one in the wedding sea they
[1:00:56] become one now I have several quotes
[1:00:59] here in a row cuz I'm wanting to
[1:01:00] establish what is it that he's asking us
[1:01:02] to what is our responsibility our
[1:01:05] responsibility is literally to manifest
[1:01:07] Jesus Christ to a Dying World The Works
[1:01:10] that he did shall you do also he's
[1:01:13] wanting them to see Jesus Christ in you
[1:01:17] that's a big
[1:01:19] responsibility when he begins to reveal
[1:01:21] himself into the seed form again the
[1:01:24] same one that went into the ground come
[1:01:25] back to be the bride just the bride and
[1:01:27] the groom is the same Flesh and Blood
[1:01:30] the same Ministry the same things doing
[1:01:33] just exactly what he done the
[1:01:37] spirit he says those in the bride do
[1:01:40] only his will we're going to reference
[1:01:41] this one quite a bit tonight no one can
[1:01:44] make them do otherwise they have thus
[1:01:46] sayith the Lord or they keep still they
[1:01:48] know that it has to be God in them doing
[1:01:50] the works fulfilling his own word he did
[1:01:53] not complete all his work while in his
[1:01:56] Earthly Ministry so now he works in and
[1:01:59] through the bride she knows that for it
[1:02:03] was not yet time for him to do certain
[1:02:05] things that he must now do but he will
[1:02:07] now fulfill through the bride that work
[1:02:11] which he left for this specific time
[1:02:14] there's a work for us to do there's
[1:02:17] things listen we don't just receive the
[1:02:19] message and kick back and go woo I'm
[1:02:20] waiting on the Rapture no he said
[1:02:22] there's things he didn't do that he
[1:02:24] wants his people to accomplish
[1:02:26] there's things he wants done and he
[1:02:28] wants to work through them to make sure
[1:02:30] it's accomplished we've been called and
[1:02:33] given a responsibility and the authority
[1:02:36] to do the same things that he did to
[1:02:38] conquer how he conquered to overcome the
[1:02:41] way that he overcame to do only his
[1:02:45] will everybody amen's real strong till
[1:02:48] you get to that part cuz that's pretty
[1:02:49] hard you mean I got to lay down my will
[1:02:53] yes what about the way mama taught me
[1:02:55] don't care
[1:02:56] unless mama taught you the according to
[1:02:58] his will then that's awesome then I do
[1:03:01] care but too many times as well Mama and
[1:03:04] Daddy and the way we think this ain't
[1:03:06] about that we do only his will what is
[1:03:09] the will of the father in my life to
[1:03:12] finish the works that he didn't finish
[1:03:14] when he was here on Earth
[1:03:16] Amen to finish the work for this
[1:03:18] specific time and by accepting this call
[1:03:22] you accept a great
[1:03:24] responsibility by yielding to the word
[1:03:26] and saying yes Lord I want to fulfill
[1:03:28] all of this it's a great responsibility
[1:03:32] but we become the beneficiaries of his
[1:03:34] goodness we become the beneficiaries of
[1:03:37] all his promises of all his might and
[1:03:39] all of his authority and all you have to
[1:03:42] do is yield wait wait I thought there
[1:03:43] was things I had to do I I had to do all
[1:03:46] these works well now let's bring it back
[1:03:48] around because you can't do any of
[1:03:52] it you can't do any of it you have to
[1:03:55] yield to his
[1:03:56] will there there's a line in there let's
[1:03:59] see if I can find it real quick uh his
[1:04:01] word she knows it was not well maybe

[1:04:21] Devils Jesus is delivering Jesus is
[1:04:23] saving Jesus is filling with the hly
[1:04:25] Holy Ghost but he's using his bride to
[1:04:28] once again say this is the truth this is
[1:04:31] the way this is the life and he's
[1:04:33] working through a people in this
[1:04:36] day they know it has to be God in
[1:04:39] them yes he says we are responsible to
[1:04:44] God we are he's responsible for his
[1:04:48] word we either Believe it or don't
[1:04:51] believe it but he is responsible to make
[1:04:54] his word right listen I found that he is
[1:04:58] a faithful and true witness he said I'll
[1:05:00] never leave you and never forsake you
[1:05:02] and he's been right there every step of
[1:05:04] the way so what I'm telling you is I
[1:05:06] don't know how he's going to do it all
[1:05:08] I'm going to have church without spot a
[1:05:09] wrinkle I don't know how he's going to
[1:05:11] do it but I know that his word can't
[1:05:13] fail I know that his promises are true
[1:05:15] and I know that he made the promise I
[1:05:17] just have to be faithful to him he'll be
[1:05:19] faithful to the promise he'll be
[1:05:21] faithful to the word he'll bring it to
[1:05:23] pass in this day we just got to be
[1:05:26] faithful to
[1:05:28] God he's the one that's going to bring
[1:05:30] it to pass he's the one that does the
[1:05:33] healing and he's the one that does the
[1:05:35] saving but he has no voice tonight but
[1:05:39] your
[1:05:39] voice that's right he has no hands
[1:05:42] tonight but your
[1:05:43] hands he has no feet tonight but our
[1:05:47] feet you are his body here on Earth and
[1:05:51] he needs you committed to allowing him
[1:05:53] to work through you yeah yes he's
[1:05:56] responsible for his word but if she's
[1:06:00] bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh
[1:06:04] you're the body here on Earth therefore
[1:06:06] you're an extension of
[1:06:08] him we are extensions of Jesus Christ
[1:06:11] tonight sometimes well I'm Just a Nobody
[1:06:14] and and woe is me and nobody cares
[1:06:18] stop you're an extension of Jesus Christ
[1:06:22] you're called and chosen for the
[1:06:23] greatest work that a group of people has
[1:06:26] ever done on the face of the
[1:06:28] Earth he thought enough of you why does
[1:06:30] it matter what you think somebody else
[1:06:32] thinks or this one thinks or this one
[1:06:34] said he said I choose you he said you're
[1:06:38] good enough he said I need you to finish
[1:06:40] the works of the last
[1:06:42] [Music]
[1:06:43] age we're an extension of him and
[1:06:46] therefore we are an ambassador from him
[1:06:50] to this world Amen now stop and think
[1:06:53] for a minute
[1:06:54] ambassadors and ambassadors represent
[1:06:56] their home country that tells you right
[1:06:59] then we ain't from here we're just
[1:07:01] aliens they represent their home country
[1:07:04] and they act as a spokesperson for their
[1:07:07] nation's interest policies and
[1:07:12] viewpoints their interests their
[1:07:14] policies and viewpoints I'm going to say
[1:07:17] it again we don't say what we think
[1:07:19] we're an
[1:07:20] ambassador ambassadors don't leave here
[1:07:22] and go to other countries and tell them
[1:07:24] what they think they're saying exactly
[1:07:27] what the most powerful person in the
[1:07:29] country told them to
[1:07:31] say we don't go and say what we think we
[1:07:34] we don't operate on our our ideas
[1:07:36] because if we operate on our own ideas
[1:07:40] then then we we we no longer have the
[1:07:42] power and authority of the country
[1:07:45] behind
[1:07:45] us we no longer have that backing a as
[1:07:49] an ambassador we know the policy of our
[1:07:52] country we know what he wants done with
[1:07:54] the word we have thus sayith the Lord or
[1:07:57] we keep
[1:07:59] still so think about it the the
[1:08:01] Ambassador from the United States goes
[1:08:03] to other country and he knows our
[1:08:05] foreign policy and when he speaks to to
[1:08:08] the world leaders on behalf of the
[1:08:10] United States if they stick to the
[1:08:12] policy of the country then the entire
[1:08:14] might of the country stands behind them
[1:08:18] you talk about a great responsibility to
[1:08:21] say only what he
[1:08:22] said to have thus sayth the Lord or keep
[1:08:27] still but if you speak what the word
[1:08:29] said then all the authority of Heaven
[1:08:32] all the authority of God stands behind
[1:08:35] you what responsibility but what
[1:08:37] benefits we have tonight when when other
[1:08:40] ambassadors rise up and say we declare
[1:08:43] that God don't move like that no more we
[1:08:45] know the policy is Jesus Christ is the
[1:08:48] same yesterday today and forever when
[1:08:51] emissaries from Hell rise up and say
[1:08:54] we're going to put cancer on them and
[1:08:55] we're going to put depression on him we
[1:08:57] know the policy is by his stripes we are
[1:09:00] healed and when we stand there and speak
[1:09:03] what the king said speak his authority
[1:09:05] will back us up
[1:09:08] Hallelujah yes sir amen all the
[1:09:11] ambassadors of of the religious world
[1:09:14] and of this sinful world and and maybe
[1:09:16] even of Satan may rise up all that wants
[1:09:18] and condemn it but he has ambassadors on
[1:09:22] the Earth today standing for truth
[1:09:24] preaching the gospel El living the
[1:09:26] gospel declaring that you can still be
[1:09:29] filled with the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:30] Ghost declaring that he still delivers
[1:09:32] people from habits of the world
[1:09:34] declaring that he still Saves The Lost
[1:09:37] he has an ambassador tonight on Earth
[1:09:39] doing the works that he did why she is
[1:09:42] his bride she is an extension of him
[1:09:46] here on the
[1:09:48] earth and we go forth standing maybe to
[1:09:51] mockery maybe to R ridicule and he's
[1:09:54] just pouring out his benefits on us he's
[1:09:57] just constantly pouring out his benefits
[1:09:59] he's pouring out his goodness and he's
[1:10:01] pouring out his mercy and he heals our
[1:10:03] diseases and he redeems us from
[1:10:05] destruction he crowns us with loving
[1:10:07] kindness he satisfies our mouth with
[1:10:09] good things he provides us for us he
[1:10:12] protects us when the enemy comes against
[1:10:14] us what benefits we have
[1:10:16] tonight great
[1:10:18] responsibilities but great benefits I
[1:10:21] say it's a privilege to serve God
[1:10:23] tonight it's a privilege to serve the
[1:10:25] the Lord what benefits he bestows upon
[1:10:29] us he says and because I live you live
[1:10:32] also and I live in you and the works
[1:10:35] that I
[1:10:37] do John 14:12 The Works that I do will
[1:10:41] identify myself in you what a message no
[1:10:45] wonder we've had a dark world of
[1:10:47] theology but in the evening time there
[1:10:49] shall come light again there will be a
[1:10:51] resurrection in the evening time it
[1:10:53] shall be light at the evening time now
[1:10:55] the the very essence of the message that
[1:10:56] was sent he is risen from the dead we
[1:10:59] his beneficiaries we who are the
[1:11:02] resurrection with him draw benefits from
[1:11:04] this by proving to the world that he is
[1:11:08] alive that's right we draw benefits by
[1:11:12] proving to the world he is alive what's
[1:11:14] our responsibility to show that there's
[1:11:17] a living God manifesting through our
[1:11:19] life and as we do it we draw benefits
[1:11:22] from it hallelujah hallelujah Psalm
[1:11:25] 68:19 blessed be the Lord who daily Loth
[1:11:29] us with benefits even the god of our
[1:11:33] Salvation
[1:11:34] sa he said forget not all our
[1:11:37] benefits you know the thing is I looked
[1:11:39] at that and I'm going way back to our
[1:11:41] opening verse
[1:11:42] now but God doesn't like to be forgotten
[1:11:45] that's right he's not saying just you
[1:11:48] know to to remember it every time you
[1:11:51] need
[1:11:53] it he's saying every single day remember
[1:11:56] that I'm good to you every single day
[1:11:59] remember that I take care of you
[1:12:01] remember that I'm standing by your side
[1:12:04] remember that I'm going to deliver you
[1:12:05] quit letting fear come in and creep in
[1:12:07] remember that I'm here don't forget all
[1:12:10] that I'm doing for you all that I've
[1:12:11] done for you all I'm going to do for you
[1:12:14] remember me remember his
[1:12:17] benefits we are his
[1:12:19] ambassadors a people who know what he
[1:12:22] wants done with the word a people who
[1:12:24] know what their responsibility
[1:12:27] is and so what makes us different from a
[1:12:30] lot of other people is that we're
[1:12:31] willing to face the
[1:12:33] word you can't be an ambassador and be
[1:12:35] unwilling to face the word what does the
[1:12:38] word say where is my life at does it
[1:12:40] measure up to the word you have to cope
[1:12:43] with the word that we we look into the
[1:12:45] word and deny none of it what it says
[1:12:49] about how how we should live we deny
[1:12:52] none of it it's not always easy
[1:12:55] but we deny none of it what it says
[1:12:56] about how men should act and live we
[1:12:59] amen it what it says about how women
[1:13:01] should act and live we amen it what what
[1:13:04] it says about the New Birth we amen
[1:13:07] it to be ambassadors we have to know the
[1:13:10] policy of the nation that we come from
[1:13:13] that's right we have a responsibility to
[1:13:16] the word we must stand for all of the
[1:13:18] word amen you can't deny any part of the
[1:13:22] word and still be bone of his bone
[1:13:24] because he is is the
[1:13:27] word you can't deny any part of the word
[1:13:30] and claim to speak for him amen we can't
[1:13:33] separate Jesus from the word we heard
[1:13:35] this Sunday brother Jason you can't
[1:13:37] separate Jesus from the well I just want
[1:13:40] Jesus I don't want the rest of the rest
[1:13:41] of this is
[1:13:44] Jesus the word is Jesus we can't
[1:13:47] separate Jesus from the word and so we
[1:13:49] can't separate the bride from the
[1:13:52] word
[1:13:54] amen so don't claim to be the body if
[1:13:58] you don't want the responsibility that's
[1:14:00] right of John
[1:14:02] 14:12 well we're the bride well we don't
[1:14:04] believe that no you can't make the claim
[1:14:06] of Bride and then deny this portion of
[1:14:10] scripture and like I said I just picked
[1:14:12] a couple that we're familiar with you
[1:14:13] could have picked lots of scriptures
[1:14:15] that that people say well we don't
[1:14:16] really believe that well we don't well
[1:14:18] then quit making a claim that you're the
[1:14:19] body of
[1:14:21] Christ verily verily I say unto you he
[1:14:24] that believeth on me the word works that
[1:14:25] I do shall he do also and Greater Works
[1:14:27] than these shall he do because I go unto
[1:14:29] my father don't claim to be the bride if
[1:14:32] you don't want the responsibility of
[1:14:33] Mark
[1:14:36] 16 these signs shall follow them that
[1:14:39] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:14:41] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:14:44] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:14:46] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:14:48] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:14:50] and they shall recover amen revelation
[1:14:53] 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come
[1:14:58] now I'm not going to go any further
[1:14:59] because I just wanted to show this
[1:15:01] portion because what it shows is that
[1:15:03] the spirit and the bride are in
[1:15:06] unity they're saying the same thing
[1:15:10] they're always going to be saying the
[1:15:12] same thing we're responsible to stand
[1:15:16] for what he said to say what he said we
[1:15:20] we can't be like the denominations who
[1:15:21] are out there claiming to speak for him
[1:15:23] but denying parts of the word if we do
[1:15:26] that we're in no better position we we
[1:15:29] know what he wants done with the word or
[1:15:31] we keep still see that keep still part's
[1:15:34] also a
[1:15:36] responsibility not to run off and do
[1:15:38] your own thing keep still until God
[1:15:41] speaks keep still until God's leadership
[1:15:45] moves in your life let how can I say
[1:15:48] this quit giving God credit for things
[1:15:51] he didn't say
[1:15:55] well this job's going to you know make
[1:15:56] it to where I hardly ever come to church
[1:15:59] but God told me this was for me no he
[1:16:02] didn't no he
[1:16:06] didn't well God told me to go down this
[1:16:08] career path and and you know I'm I'm
[1:16:10] never going to see my family and I'm
[1:16:12] never going to be no he
[1:16:15] didn't you're making God a liar you're
[1:16:17] making him contradict his own
[1:16:20] word quit making him contradict his own
[1:16:23] word we are to be his repres
[1:16:24] representative saying what he said doing
[1:16:28] what he wants done and we have a
[1:16:30] responsibility to represent him
[1:16:34] well what do you mean by this brother
[1:16:36] I'm going to go kind of slow through
[1:16:37] this we have a
[1:16:39] responsibility if we're going to use the
[1:16:41] word
[1:16:42] Christian to live a Christian
[1:16:46] Life or you're not representing him well
[1:16:49] amen your actions your words the way you
[1:16:53] treat people it has a ripple
[1:16:56] effect both positive and
[1:16:59] negative for
[1:17:01] example first your family name oh he's
[1:17:05] your dad
[1:17:08] okay that could be good or bad that's an
[1:17:11] awesome person right there who are you
[1:17:12] I'm oh that's your dad well that make
[1:17:14] sense or really you're his
[1:17:18] kid and then it goes beyond family the
[1:17:21] church name oh they go to evening like
[1:17:24] Tabernacle oh those
[1:17:26] people okay remember you represent way
[1:17:29] more than
[1:17:32] yourself you know I talk to my own kids
[1:17:35] and and I say look I get it kids are
[1:17:37] going to be silly kids want to have fun
[1:17:39] they do kids do kid things okay but even
[1:17:43] in a restaurant you may not be doing
[1:17:45] anything wrong but make sure you're
[1:17:46] acting in a way that when people see you
[1:17:48] they say those are those young people
[1:17:50] from evening light Tabernacle now what
[1:17:53] what awesome kids those are look how
[1:17:56] awesome their act look how polite they
[1:17:58] are look how considerate they are your
[1:18:00] actions have a ripple effect Beyond
[1:18:04] yourself and then it goes even Beyond
[1:18:06] evening like Tabernacle to the message
[1:18:08] oh they they believe that
[1:18:11] Prophet know they should all be positive
[1:18:14] Ripple effects man they go to eating in
[1:18:16] like Tabernacle they're from this family
[1:18:18] they believe in that Prophet I don't
[1:18:20] understand those things but every one of
[1:18:21] those people I run into are awesome
[1:18:23] people they're Christian people people
[1:18:25] they live a life with standards how
[1:18:28] wonderful that's the ripple effect that
[1:18:30] we should have we should be representing
[1:18:32] him
[1:18:34] well let your live
[1:18:37] testimony match the testimony of your
[1:18:39] mouth that's right keep your word these
[1:18:43] are basic this is Sunday school stuff
[1:18:47] forgive people show Mercy to people be
[1:18:50] honorable in business treat people kind
[1:18:54] love your friends here's a fun one love
[1:18:57] your
[1:18:58] enemies go the extra mile for people
[1:19:01] don't be greedy live for others brother
[1:19:06] brandham said eternal life is living for
[1:19:09] others this is pretty simple thought
[1:19:11] brother Aaron Eternal life's pretty big
[1:19:14] deal that's what this whole thing's
[1:19:17] about eternal life what is it living for
[1:19:20] others putting others before yourself
[1:19:23] not being greedy
[1:19:25] don't don't just talk about
[1:19:27] it live
[1:19:29] it don't just talk about it why live it
[1:19:33] let your life match the testimony of
[1:19:36] your lips represent this King in a
[1:19:39] positive light he deserves it this King
[1:19:41] went to Calvary and he paid the ultimate
[1:19:43] price that we might have life he came
[1:19:46] and took the worst beating that we could
[1:19:47] have healing he he commissioned us and
[1:19:50] said the works that I do shall you do
[1:19:52] also and then brother Bram comes and
[1:19:54] says the truth church is Mark 16 in
[1:19:56] action we're called to to represent him
[1:19:59] in a positive light to do the things he
[1:20:01] called us to do to be a Shining Light to
[1:20:04] the world that God still lives he still
[1:20:06] saves he still loves you and look at
[1:20:09] this life that he's given me don't let
[1:20:12] your life be something that turns them
[1:20:14] away from
[1:20:16] it brother Bram says being brought to
[1:20:19] into the presence of God when God made a
[1:20:22] promise God is obligated to that promise
[1:20:24] and when he brings that promise to pass
[1:20:26] then people are afraid to face up to the
[1:20:28] responsibility of coping with the
[1:20:30] message of the hour we find that
[1:20:33] everywhere he says and when you see then
[1:20:36] in this day now the word of God has made
[1:20:38] these promises of these things that we
[1:20:39] see happening amen we see
[1:20:43] happening then we've got the
[1:20:45] responsibility to either face up to it
[1:20:47] or get away from
[1:20:49] it I don't want nobody to leave but I'm
[1:20:51] just saying the prophet said face up to
[1:20:53] it or get away from it that's right you
[1:20:56] just can't stay neutral you've got to do
[1:20:59] something about it some move has got to
[1:21:04] be
[1:21:05] made I'm going say it again he died for
[1:21:07] our benefit he died for our Privileges
[1:21:10] and he wants all of them to be flowing
[1:21:13] through our lives he didn't die for
[1:21:16] those privileges so we could say it
[1:21:17] don't
[1:21:18] matter it does
[1:21:21] matter he wants you to have those those
[1:21:23] privileges he died for those privileges
[1:21:26] he wants healing flowing through our
[1:21:28] lives he wants Deliverance flowing
[1:21:31] through our lives he wants salvation
[1:21:33] flowing through our lives and just as as
[1:21:36] his life brought Victory and his life
[1:21:38] testified that the word was truth he
[1:21:40] wants our lives to testify that the word
[1:21:43] is
[1:21:44] truth that there's a living God and he's
[1:21:47] the same and he'll set you free tonight
[1:21:50] he wants us reaping the benefits that he
[1:21:53] shed his blood for
[1:21:55] not just going along like everything's
[1:21:57] just common place everything's the same
[1:22:00] as it always was he wants us enjoying
[1:22:03] the Privileges that sons and daughters
[1:22:05] have access
[1:22:06] to and even more than that he wants you
[1:22:08] to be willing to fight for those
[1:22:10] privileges he was willing to die for
[1:22:13] them he wants a people that are willing
[1:22:15] to fight for them amen listen to brother
[1:22:18] Brown talking about this he says we
[1:22:19] realize as
[1:22:21] Christians that we live so far under our
[1:22:24] privilege is that you do not desire us
[1:22:26] to be like that tired and weary and run
[1:22:30] down and weakening you desire us to be
[1:22:33] filled with the spirit of God it's one
[1:22:35] of the benefits that he died for us he
[1:22:38] says you don't realize the Privileges
[1:22:40] that you're living under you don't
[1:22:41] realize there's many great men many
[1:22:43] Saints there's thousands of holy men
[1:22:45] that died and Years Gone by
[1:22:47] Spirit-filled men who would have love to
[1:22:49] have seen this day that you're living in
[1:22:52] let you and I take advantage of it amen
[1:22:55] don't just set these things aside oh
[1:22:57] it's the last day oh it's the message of
[1:22:59] the hour oh there's a body change
[1:23:01] promise oh we can have healing let's
[1:23:03] take advantage of it let's take full
[1:23:06] advantage of it tonight and lay aside
[1:23:08] our thing and say Lord I want all that
[1:23:10] you died for I want to fulfill
[1:23:12] everything Lord I want you to fill my
[1:23:14] life fill every fi of my being I want
[1:23:17] everything you have for
[1:23:20] me we ought to be ashamed of ourselves
[1:23:25] calling ourselves Christian who believe
[1:23:27] in great Jehovah the promises that he
[1:23:29] gives us and the benefits he's got for
[1:23:31] us and the first little
[1:23:33] discouragement we throw it
[1:23:38] away oh my how he must
[1:23:41] feel when he went through so much and he
[1:23:43] gave so much when he went to such
[1:23:45] extremes even in this day in the
[1:23:47] ministry of Malachi 4 so that we would
[1:23:49] know our rights so that we would know
[1:23:51] our benefits and we would know the power
[1:23:53] of God and we' witnessed it right here
[1:23:55] in evening light
[1:23:56] Tabernacle not just in the ministry of
[1:23:58] William brandom although it was it was
[1:24:00] great and but even in this church and
[1:24:03] people you know we've seen the power of
[1:24:05] God move and yet people will throw it
[1:24:08] away at the first sign of trouble throw
[1:24:10] it away when it doesn't happen right
[1:24:12] away throw it away when it doesn't
[1:24:14] happen the way they want or the way they
[1:24:16] expect and it's because people's faith
[1:24:18] has become
[1:24:21] paralyzed it's a world of doubt and
[1:24:25] unbelief and it's a time where people
[1:24:27] say that the Lord has delayed his
[1:24:30] coming and they begin people even
[1:24:33] Christians begin to view promises with
[1:24:37] skepticism we can't allow the
[1:24:41] disillusioned those that have become
[1:24:43] disillusioned to change our
[1:24:45] expectations during the time of what
[1:24:47] they call the delay I'm not lowering my
[1:24:51] expectations I refuse to lower my
[1:24:53] expectations I'm not I'm not going to
[1:24:55] make excuses or or or or look for a way
[1:24:57] to explain these explain things away I'm
[1:25:00] like brother brandom said let's take
[1:25:02] advantage of it let's get everything
[1:25:05] that God promised I'm not going to stop
[1:25:06] short of a new birth experience I'm not
[1:25:08] going to settle for a halfway life I'm
[1:25:10] not going to settle for some deal that
[1:25:12] the devil makes that maybe your kids
[1:25:14] will make it at the white Throne
[1:25:15] judgment or maybe you can have this I'm
[1:25:17] not going to settle for a tore up
[1:25:18] marriage and a tore up home I'm going to
[1:25:20] take advantage of the message of the
[1:25:22] hour and the word of God and I'm going
[1:25:25] to take advantage of it and have every
[1:25:27] promise that God has promised me in this
[1:25:29] day I may not see it today or tomorrow
[1:25:32] or next week or next month but I'm going
[1:25:35] to stand in it and hold on to it and
[1:25:37] take advantage of it it's my
[1:25:39] responsibility to God he's responsible
[1:25:43] to the
[1:25:44] word
[1:25:48] hallelujah I say we shouldn't stop short
[1:25:50] of any promise that he's promised us in
[1:25:52] this day
[1:25:54] he said forget not all of his
[1:25:57] benefits take every one of them I'm
[1:26:00] going to get what he promised me I'm
[1:26:03] going to have what he promised me he
[1:26:05] said it I believe it that settles
[1:26:09] it I'm going to get every one of them he
[1:26:11] made the promise he's just looking for
[1:26:13] somebody to believe it tonight he needs
[1:26:16] somebody willing to risk it all tonight
[1:26:18] to lay it all on the line tonight
[1:26:20] regardless of how things look regardless
[1:26:22] of what the world says regardless of
[1:26:24] what your family says regardless of what
[1:26:27] the church says somebody says Lord I
[1:26:29] trust you I trust your word I'm relying
[1:26:33] on you to fulfill your word
[1:26:35] tonight I'm going all the
[1:26:37] way problem is brother Joe a lot of
[1:26:40] people have accepted Pharaoh's offer
[1:26:42] come
[1:26:43] on yeah I'll let you go but only go so
[1:26:47] far only go so far only go so far in
[1:26:51] your worship only go so far with your
[1:26:54] family family I only go so far in your
[1:26:56] witness and people are willing to accept
[1:26:58] that offer cuz in that offer there's no
[1:27:00] Red Sea in that offer there's no
[1:27:02] Starving in the wilderness in that offer
[1:27:05] there's no bitter Waters in that offer
[1:27:07] there's no serpents in the wilderness
[1:27:09] but in that offer there's no Promised
[1:27:11] Land either there's no Deliverance
[1:27:13] either there's no healing either in that
[1:27:15] offer we don't cross over into a body
[1:27:17] change I'm not accepting that offer
[1:27:19] tonight I'm going all the way
[1:27:22] across I to tell you something else too
[1:27:25] if you've been set free don't take a
[1:27:27] halfway offer and I've told y'all this
[1:27:29] before I'm going to say it again to make
[1:27:31] a point because all it's doing is
[1:27:33] guaranteeing that you're going to be
[1:27:35] recaptured you're going to be caught
[1:27:37] again you're going to be a prisoner
[1:27:39] again well I broke away from that God
[1:27:41] delivered me from that but I just like
[1:27:42] to dabble in this little thing and he
[1:27:45] broke me free from that but I like to
[1:27:46] dabble in this you know just CU it
[1:27:48] you're going to be a prisoner
[1:27:50] again I said just like in in the old
[1:27:53] slave days if a slave managed to escape
[1:27:55] from a
[1:27:56] plantation he didn't just cross the
[1:27:58] property line and go woo I'm free I'mma
[1:28:01] build a house right here
[1:28:04] sir you fing be
[1:28:07] caught you better run to a land of
[1:28:09] Freedom you better run to a place where
[1:28:11] slavery don't exist you better run to a
[1:28:14] place where the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:16] will keep you free the rest of your life
[1:28:19] and when them slave Hunters come and say
[1:28:21] he's mine somebody stands up and says no
[1:28:23] he he's free in this land there is no
[1:28:27] slavery get to a place of Freedom
[1:28:30] tonight go all the
[1:28:32] way
[1:28:34] Hallelujah take all the benefits of the
[1:28:37] land take them
[1:28:39] all we have a
[1:28:42] responsibility the full word is open us
[1:28:45] and he says take it all come on come on
[1:28:47] put it in
[1:28:48] action when you don't take all the
[1:28:50] benefits of the land they become strange
[1:28:52] to you amen right you don't recognize
[1:28:55] them anymore for what they
[1:28:57] are you don't believe them anymore or
[1:29:01] believe for them or expect them in your
[1:29:03] life and it was just an interesting
[1:29:05] thing that came to me as I was reading
[1:29:08] this quote from brother
[1:29:09] brandham he saids there were was I
[1:29:11] believe it was Gad one of them and
[1:29:15] perhaps half a half tribe it was Gad the
[1:29:19] Hal tribe of Manasseh and Reuben Gad
[1:29:22] Ruben Hal tribe of Manasseh
[1:29:25] he says they didn't go over into the
[1:29:27] promised land they stayed on this
[1:29:30] side now notice
[1:29:32] something go back and read it I didn't
[1:29:34] have time to put it in my slides or
[1:29:37] whatever but the reason they gave Moses
[1:29:39] for not wanting to go into the promised
[1:29:42] land is because they had
[1:29:45] cattle and that this side was better for
[1:29:49] cattle and they didn't care about all
[1:29:51] the other promises all they cared about
[1:29:53] was their cattle
[1:29:54] cattle we have cattle this is what we
[1:29:58] want they told me said this land's good
[1:30:00] for cattle that's what we want this is
[1:30:01] where we're staying now fast forward
[1:30:03] Jesus visits that same people remember
[1:30:05] he goes to the to to gadera it's the
[1:30:08] land of GAD and look at the results of
[1:30:10] staying out of the full benefits of
[1:30:11] God's love when Jesus visits them he
[1:30:13] went over to Gad and that's where they
[1:30:16] dwelt that's where they made that's
[1:30:18] where they come from right there and
[1:30:20] their attitude was still the same they
[1:30:21] wouldn't go to the promised land before
[1:30:23] why cattle why they asked Jesus to leave
[1:30:25] this time
[1:30:29] pigs they were still focused on their
[1:30:32] for the exact same thing he caused their
[1:30:35] pigs to run and they said get
[1:30:37] out get out you messed with the pigs he
[1:30:41] said it cost them a bunch of hogs to
[1:30:43] have the meeting they asked Jesus to
[1:30:45] leave their land they didn't want
[1:30:46] nothing to do with it they had their own
[1:30:48] ways they had their own
[1:30:51] churches Cycles
[1:30:54] still focused on the exact same thing
[1:30:56] listen get your eyes off the world get
[1:30:57] your eyes off your finances get the eyes
[1:30:59] off all these things how can I make more
[1:31:01] money how can I be more popular how can
[1:31:03] I get this girl how can I get that boy
[1:31:05] because if that's what you're focused on
[1:31:06] you're not going to cross over into the
[1:31:08] promised land I say seek ye first the
[1:31:10] kingdom of God get in the promised land
[1:31:13] then all these things will be added unto
[1:31:16] you says they had their churches they
[1:31:18] had their own ways lay your ways down
[1:31:21] tonight and say Lord I just want to Sur
[1:31:23] surrender it all to you tonight have
[1:31:26] your way in my life Lord
[1:31:29] Jesus they allowed their expectations to
[1:31:33] be lowered on the journey they just look
[1:31:35] for a place for
[1:31:37] cattle we can't allow our expectations
[1:31:39] to be lowered the world is pumping its
[1:31:42] venom it's called
[1:31:44] unbelief and if you aren't careful you
[1:31:46] get struck and it brings death and it
[1:31:49] brings
[1:31:50] paralysis we can't let the world
[1:31:52] paralyze our faith we got to have our
[1:31:55] faith paralyze the
[1:31:57] world listen this he says Lord God now
[1:32:00] it's you you would not let anything harm
[1:32:02] your scripture I've seen when there were
[1:32:04] a half million standing there in Bombay
[1:32:06] India Hindus Witch Doctors trying to
[1:32:09] challenge he talks about this all the
[1:32:10] time you ought to go back and just
[1:32:12] search it and how you paralyzed them and
[1:32:15] how you shook that Nation he says some
[1:32:17] place they couldn't move out of their
[1:32:19] seat he paralyzed them don't let the
[1:32:22] world paralyze you amen when our God is
[1:32:25] given a faith that'll paralyze the enemy
[1:32:28] he said that's what they're looking to
[1:32:29] see talking about the world remember we
[1:32:31] have a responsibility to show the world
[1:32:34] Amen that's what they're looking to see
[1:32:35] they don't care about some little
[1:32:37] pamphlet their God has not has got just
[1:32:40] as much power as any other one you talk
[1:32:42] about see but when it comes to something
[1:32:44] they can see that will dumbfound their
[1:32:47] gods and stop their witch doctors and
[1:32:49] paralyze them in their tracks and see
[1:32:52] then they believe that there is a God
[1:32:53] that can can act that's the gospel that
[1:32:55] the Heathen has to have that's all our
[1:32:58] education and ethics will not work with
[1:32:59] the Heathen he's got to see something
[1:33:02] he's got to know that it's right and I
[1:33:04] say that's not just the gospel the
[1:33:06] Heathen need that's the gospel evening
[1:33:07] like Tabernacle needs tonight a God that
[1:33:10] moves a God that will paralyze fear
[1:33:12] paralyze anxiety paralyze cancer
[1:33:15] paralyze that evil spirit of pornography
[1:33:17] that's trying to come into your life a
[1:33:18] god that'll stand up and say you're not
[1:33:20] taking another step and paralyze them
[1:33:23] right in tracks that's the God we need
[1:33:25] and when we get that God on the inside
[1:33:27] of us then we got something to show the
[1:33:30] world then we got something that they'll
[1:33:32] look at and say it even stops our Gods
[1:33:37] Hallelujah we need
[1:33:39] it we need that same
[1:33:42] gospel amen we can't sit back and let
[1:33:45] what we have become common to us Church
[1:33:49] what we have is
[1:33:51] special it's a treasure
[1:33:55] it's
[1:33:56] life brother brand tells a story of the
[1:33:58] little boy in the 10- cent store and how
[1:34:01] his mama couldn't get him to focus on
[1:34:03] anything and was just staring way off
[1:34:05] into Yonder she began to panic because
[1:34:09] she would put everything in front of his
[1:34:10] face try to get him to respond to it try
[1:34:13] to get him to move try to get him to
[1:34:15] acknowledge it and he wouldn't move and
[1:34:18] brother Brown tells this story several
[1:34:20] times he just sat there staring she
[1:34:23] began to panic because nothing would
[1:34:25] move
[1:34:26] him he says but you know the church has
[1:34:29] become more or less like a paralyzed
[1:34:31] condition all these quotes I'm finish to
[1:34:33] share come from this story it becomes
[1:34:36] too common these things well that's just
[1:34:40] about the condition the church is
[1:34:41] getting into God shook every kind of
[1:34:44] miracle and sign before the church and
[1:34:45] still they sat staring in space just
[1:34:48] like they didn't know
[1:34:54] how true that is with the church today
[1:34:56] God shook every kind of gift he can
[1:34:58] before the church and they still sit and
[1:35:00] stare looking for something else
[1:35:02] Hallelujah that's right God is going to
[1:35:05] get tired shaking gifts before you after
[1:35:08] a while sit
[1:35:11] paralyzed he said Jesus is here now
[1:35:13] showing himself before you as a living
[1:35:15] God and the church has become just
[1:35:17] staring out why we believe oh yes we
[1:35:20] believe but it's become so common to the
[1:35:24] people I'm focus in on this quote can't
[1:35:27] you wake up friends to a fact that it's
[1:35:30] a living God that's in our midst I'm
[1:35:33] afraid as said the other night so many
[1:35:35] gifts has been brought before the church
[1:35:37] till they sit staring paralyzed it ought
[1:35:39] to shake the heart of people until they
[1:35:41] rejoice and be so glad eating like
[1:35:44] Tabernacle I say God has shaken Us in
[1:35:46] this day he's shaken us the last few
[1:35:49] years what sermons have we heard what
[1:35:51] singing have we heard what ser serves
[1:35:54] that have shook this place what healings
[1:35:56] and what
[1:35:57] deliverances and many times he's moving
[1:35:59] whether it's in the preaching or
[1:36:01] prophecy or tongues or somebody singing
[1:36:03] especially when the power of God moves
[1:36:05] and some of us sit
[1:36:09] paralyzed he says it ought to shake the
[1:36:12] heart of the
[1:36:15] people the power of God's moving the
[1:36:17] Saints are singing worships going forth
[1:36:20] and we sit paralyzed he said God's going
[1:36:23] to get tired of shaking things in front
[1:36:25] of your face after a
[1:36:27] while what what sermons we've heard what
[1:36:31] powerful moves of God and I say to you
[1:36:33] it can't become common to
[1:36:35] us you are blessed people you're a
[1:36:38] called people and I say he speaks in
[1:36:41] every single
[1:36:42] service we got to quit living below our
[1:36:44] privileges he he died that we can have
[1:36:46] these privileges quit living in a
[1:36:49] paralyzed condition when he's already
[1:36:50] won the victory draw benefits from it
[1:36:53] face the word tonight put it in action
[1:36:55] tonight he he he's asking for Eden light
[1:36:58] Tabernacle to believe he's asking for
[1:37:00] you to trust amen he asked when the son
[1:37:03] of man cometh shall he find faith on the
[1:37:06] earth now I'm going to start bringing
[1:37:08] this down I'm sorry if it's a little
[1:37:09] long tonight but we are fit in we're
[1:37:11] turning the corner for
[1:37:14] home we have a lot to
[1:37:18] fulfill we have a lot to
[1:37:21] manifest and it's going to take Faith
[1:37:23] Faith to do it
[1:37:26] Hall it's going to take Faith to do it
[1:37:30] that's why our heart was turned to the
[1:37:34] faith but you're going to get as much as
[1:37:36] you can believe for right all right
[1:37:40] that's an individual thing am you're
[1:37:42] going to get as much as you can believe
[1:37:45] for you've got the faith let me go ahead
[1:37:48] and clear that you've got the
[1:37:51] faith but sometimes it sits par
[1:37:55] paralyzed the faith is
[1:37:57] there but we can't allow it to be
[1:37:59] paralyzed we got to turn it
[1:38:01] loose we got to loose the faith so I ask
[1:38:05] you this how does faith
[1:38:07] come by hearing the word of God and then
[1:38:11] you ask the question why am I dealing
[1:38:13] with so much
[1:38:14] doubt why am I dealing with so much
[1:38:17] unbelief why am I dealing with so much
[1:38:20] fear and so then I turn the question
[1:38:22] around
[1:38:25] what are you
[1:38:28] hearing what are you feeding
[1:38:31] on where's the unbelief coming from
[1:38:35] where's that snake bite of Doubt coming
[1:38:38] from don't feed on the things that are
[1:38:41] coming out of the world the whole thing
[1:38:43] is set up the whole thing is set up to
[1:38:47] cause
[1:38:48] unbelief the whole thing is set up to
[1:38:50] cause doubt when that question comes
[1:38:53] comes when when those that don't believe
[1:38:55] try to get in your ear when that serpent
[1:38:57] begins hissing and whing Eve don't
[1:38:59] listen to
[1:39:00] it don't give it a minute Eve go back to
[1:39:03] the word of God turn away that's faith
[1:39:06] building up but when you run away from
[1:39:07] that and get back to the word and listen
[1:39:09] to that then your faith begins to rise
[1:39:12] don't listen when that Devil Comes what
[1:39:15] what what's he doing he the Serpent's
[1:39:16] coming to see if he can get you to doubt
[1:39:18] he's hissing to see if he can bring
[1:39:20] unbelief but we are to testify what the
[1:39:24] word said not what the serpent
[1:39:30] says but what happens is when we go
[1:39:34] against the word it paralyzes our faith
[1:39:37] right why what the what the scriptures
[1:39:39] say if your conscience condemn you
[1:39:42] not so think about it if you just give
[1:39:44] in a little bit when you know better I'm
[1:39:47] not saying go live some horrible life
[1:39:49] but do this and you knew better and do
[1:39:52] this and you know better better and let
[1:39:54] this in and you know better and then you
[1:39:57] fall on your knees and you need Faith to
[1:39:59] ask for that
[1:40:00] Miracle says and hereby we know that we
[1:40:03] are of the truth and shall assure our
[1:40:04] hearts before him for if our heart
[1:40:06] condemn us God is greater than our heart
[1:40:09] knoweth all things beloved if our heart
[1:40:12] condemn us not then we have confidence
[1:40:15] toward
[1:40:16] God it's not now look what's the
[1:40:19] solution to that brother
[1:40:20] repent just repent it's over like that
[1:40:23] repent of that thing move on and stand
[1:40:25] before God with a clean
[1:40:27] conscience repent it's not I'm not
[1:40:30] trying to make it sound like oh no you
[1:40:31] let a little thing in you're done for
[1:40:33] I'm not saying that at all I'm saying
[1:40:34] that's why you're sitting there
[1:40:35] struggling say where's my faith what's
[1:40:37] going on something's in there it needs
[1:40:38] to be dealt with all right just deal
[1:40:40] with it just move on from the situation
[1:40:44] because when we compromise and we begin
[1:40:46] to blend in with the world and we think
[1:40:48] this part doesn't really matter and and
[1:40:50] surely that part was just an opinion
[1:40:53] even though we know better brother
[1:40:55] brandham says lot did that and it
[1:40:57] paralyzed him and it paralyzed his
[1:41:00] people down there they couldn't see
[1:41:02] it think about it it paralyzed
[1:41:07] them where he lost his wife he lost
[1:41:11] large portion of his whole family it
[1:41:13] vexed a lot but he stayed why didn't he
[1:41:17] leave couldn't leave he's
[1:41:19] paralyzed his faith had been paralyzed
[1:41:23] but Abraham says Lord you see their
[1:41:24] hands and may the Holy Ghost which has
[1:41:26] now told them to raise their hands may
[1:41:28] he come and set them free from the
[1:41:30] vibrations of the world till they can
[1:41:32] get beyond the paralyzed charm of the
[1:41:34] serpent that the snake bite of sin the
[1:41:36] enchantments of this modern world will
[1:41:38] not lure them any longer may they raise
[1:41:41] their eyes to Christ just now and
[1:41:42] receive him as their savior just now he
[1:41:48] says just
[1:41:51] now and maybe you've been struggling
[1:41:53] Ling in your faith maybe you've been
[1:41:55] dealing with unbelief and doubt listen
[1:41:57] I'm not trying to come down you at Wars

[1:42:01] in here that can say I never war with
[1:42:03] unbelief I never wor without yes we
[1:42:06] do it tries to make us live below our
[1:42:09] Privileges and it tries to make us
[1:42:10] forget the benefits that serpent brings
[1:42:13] doubt and tries to make us a poor
[1:42:15] representative but I'd like to remind
[1:42:17] you and this is going to be our closing
[1:42:18] point it may take me a second to get
[1:42:20] through it but this is my closing point
[1:42:21] I'd like to remind you as we bring this
[1:42:23] to a close that one of our benefits is
[1:42:26] found in Matthew 16 and also in Matthew

[1:42:35] read it to you Matthew 18 verily I say
[1:42:39] unto you whatsoever you shall bind on
[1:42:42] Earth shall be bound in heaven and
[1:42:45] whatsoever you shall loose on Earth

[1:42:55] time to start binding that serpent

[1:43:26] right to bind him he hasn't been given
[1:43:28] the right to bind me but I've been given

[1:43:50] children that are bound by the devil to
[1:43:51] loose your husband to loose a friend to
[1:43:54] loose those around you that are bound
[1:44:00] amen y'all know this
[1:44:02] story I'mma go through
[1:44:05] it it's a vision brother Brown if you
[1:44:07] want to read the whole thing because
[1:44:08] these are in order but I skipped parts
[1:44:10] and took paragraphs out because it was
[1:44:12] very long it's in Paradox
[1:44:15] 1961 he says and I heard the weed
[1:44:18] smashing down he's having a vision and I
[1:44:21] looked and here come A huge monster
[1:44:22] snake crawling through the weeds and I
[1:44:25] thought now knowing this is
[1:44:28] Vision then I shall see what this animal
[1:44:31] or this Beast is and he crawled up on
[1:44:34] the highway and as soon as I got sight
[1:44:37] of him I knew it was a
[1:44:40] Mamba now before we go any further I
[1:44:42] don't want you to get confused the yell
[1:44:44] stuff's my own words those some notes I
[1:44:47] made so that ain't brother
[1:44:49] Brown there's nothing as poison as a
[1:44:51] Mamba and the snake of of course
[1:44:54] represents
[1:44:55] sin death see and like we already made
[1:44:59] point and what I have here is we're
[1:45:01] talking about unbelief what is the only
[1:45:03] sin brother B says it's unbelief he says
[1:45:07] and when he hits you you just got a few
[1:45:09] breaths till you're
[1:45:11] finished turn real it don't only
[1:45:13] paralyze but it gets in the bloodstream
[1:45:16] it gets the nerves everything you just
[1:45:19] die in a few
[1:45:21] seconds says and there he was on the
[1:45:24] highway I thought well this is it so I
[1:45:28] looked at
[1:45:29] [Music]
[1:45:32] him so I looked at him and he looked
[1:45:35] angry at me and he licked his tongue and
[1:45:38] here he come but when he got close to me
[1:45:40] he would run up fast and then he would
[1:45:42] get slower and slower and just quiver
[1:45:44] and stop and then something would hold
[1:45:47] him off he couldn't bite me and he would
[1:45:49] turn around on the other side and try to
[1:45:53] approach from this side see see he's
[1:45:56] going to use different
[1:45:58] tactics he may even use different
[1:46:02] people he may use
[1:46:05] church he may be getting to a family
[1:46:07] situation to come and strike you all of
[1:46:10] it to try to paralyze your faith try to
[1:46:13] weaken your faith the attacks come from
[1:46:16] here and the attacks come from there and
[1:46:17] the serpents coming from this side and
[1:46:19] you feel totally overwhelmed but I'd
[1:46:22] like to remind you tonight greater is he
[1:46:24] that is in
[1:46:26] you greater Is He And he says that snake
[1:46:28] would come up and it would almost get to
[1:46:30] him but it just couldn't strike him why
[1:46:33] greater is he that's in you says then he
[1:46:36] turned and and looked at my friend in a
[1:46:39] way he
[1:46:40] went after my
[1:46:44] friend and I seen my friend just jumping
[1:46:47] way up in the air and and over him and
[1:46:49] over him and over him trying to thing
[1:46:51] was striking at him and I thought oh if
[1:46:54] it ever hits him it'll be instant death
[1:46:57] and it was striking at him like that and
[1:46:59] I threw my hands up I said oh God have
[1:47:01] mercy on my brother I said if that
[1:47:03] serpent ever strikes him it'll kill
[1:47:09] him I'm on the wrong page I'm very sorry
[1:47:12] there we go and just then the serpent
[1:47:14] turned to me when I said that and looked
[1:47:17] at me again and a voice came from above
[1:47:20] me and said you you've been given power
[1:47:24] to bind him the
[1:47:27] worst or
[1:47:30] any the
[1:47:32] worst or any brother Aon you don't know
[1:47:35] what I'm dealing with tonight the
[1:47:39] worst or
[1:47:41] any I said if we got any of those enies
[1:47:43] attacking us tonight that we get ready
[1:47:46] to bind them right now as we bring this
[1:47:48] down I want us to get ready to bind them
[1:47:51] because that's one of the benefits you
[1:47:53] have as the Bride of Jesus Christ you've
[1:47:55] been given the power to bind the devil
[1:47:58] the worst or any he said there's one
[1:48:02] thing you must do you must be more
[1:48:03] sincere see you must be more sincere I
[1:48:06] said well God forgive me of my
[1:48:08] insincerity let me have sincerity and
[1:48:10] when I raised up my hands to him there
[1:48:12] was a great something come over me just
[1:48:14] lifted me up seemed like my whole body
[1:48:17] was charged with
[1:48:20] something and I said s in the name of
[1:48:23] the Lord
[1:48:25] Jesus I bind you and the serpent of blue
[1:48:29] smoke flew out of him and he curled up
[1:48:31] and he made that sign like a s capital S
[1:48:34] made backwards an an sign and it means
[1:48:37] bind this one or anything below him
[1:48:40] because he was the worst blue smoke fell
[1:48:42] out of him and his tail choked his own
[1:48:44] self to death around his head and when
[1:48:47] he made the backwards s that that an
[1:48:49] sign like a conjunction you see choked
[1:48:51] it to death and the brother was free
[1:48:56] what did I say to you it ain't just
[1:48:58] about you what about your brother what
[1:49:00] about your children what about your
[1:49:02] husband what about your and the brother
[1:49:05] was
[1:49:06] free and just then a voice
[1:49:09] came and said you can unbind him
[1:49:14] also so I said then Satan that I might
[1:49:17] know
[1:49:18] notice that I might know I unbind you
[1:49:22] and when when it did he started coming
[1:49:24] to life again
[1:49:26] wiggling and this is the part I want to
[1:49:28] get down
[1:49:30] to maybe over a period of time that old
[1:49:33] man in your life has tried to resurrect
[1:49:37] right that old man that you thought was
[1:49:39] completely dealt with has started to
[1:49:41] wiggle a little bit that old man tries
[1:49:44] to rise up again that's why Paul said
[1:49:46] you got to Die
[1:49:47] daily daily not I died six months ago
[1:49:50] you better die again today cuz that old
[1:49:53] man starts to W but brother Aaron I
[1:49:55] bound it brother Aaron I had
[1:49:58] Victory I dealt with that thing but then
[1:50:00] a few miles down the road a few years
[1:50:02] down the road that thing tries to lift
[1:50:04] up his head again and come at you
[1:50:06] again brother we thought this thing was
[1:50:08] over forever we thought I thought I was
[1:50:11] beyond this and yet that thing starts to
[1:50:13] lift up its
[1:50:15] head and I I I had peace why is this
[1:50:19] anxiety trying to come back on me I had
[1:50:22] Joy why is this depression trying to
[1:50:24] come back on me why is this struggle in
[1:50:27] my life coming back
[1:50:29] again I remember when church was my
[1:50:31] favorite place I I love to come I was
[1:50:34] loosed and and I was set free and I'd
[1:50:36] worship and I couldn't wait to get in
[1:50:37] the house of God I couldn't wait to be
[1:50:39] with my my brothers and sisters and and
[1:50:42] now there's something trying to rob me
[1:50:44] and try to draw me out again it's
[1:50:45] robbing my passion it's robbing my
[1:50:49] Zeal it's like a roller coaster I'm up
[1:50:52] and down good today upset about
[1:50:53] something tomorrow and the Devil comes
[1:50:56] in and tells you see you've lost your
[1:51:01] Victory listen to me you have not lost
[1:51:05] your Victory the vision said that you
[1:51:10] might
[1:51:11] know the vision said that you might know
[1:51:16] bind him again you are not defeated
[1:51:20] tonight evening like Tabernacle you have
[1:51:22] not fail tonight it's just another
[1:51:24] opportunity bind him again and when he
[1:51:27] tries to rise up bind him again and when
[1:51:30] he tries to rise up bind him again that
[1:51:33] you might know you've been given the
[1:51:35] power to bind maybe he got loose because
[1:51:37] of something you did something you said
[1:51:40] maybe you got cold and he starts to
[1:51:42] wiggle free and he says bind him again
[1:51:44] tonight you still have that power he's
[1:51:47] still subject to you you haven't lost
[1:51:49] your Victory it's that you might know
[1:51:51] that in this moment you still have the
[1:51:53] authority bind that depression tonight

[1:52:17] back in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:52:20] when it did the smoke flew out of him
