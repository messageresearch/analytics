[51:36] direction and Lord wisdom we pray we
[51:41] commit this service to your hands Lord
[51:42] no doubt if I'd ask for uh hands to be
[51:46] lifted they've been lifted all over this
[51:48] building Lord knowing Lord that you are
[51:51] mindful of every need and you know and
[51:54] you're there for every situation
[51:56] now we ask father you'll just come and
[51:58] take complete control tonight this this
[52:01] evening Lord and touch hearts and touch
[52:03] lives and Minister father strengthen us
[52:06] we pray Lord we heard just a few moments
[52:10] ago that we are warriors Lord and Lord
[52:13] we're here to report for Duty we ask the
[52:15] Lord that you would come and take
[52:17] preeminence of this service we pray
[52:19] [Music]
[52:23] turn to Genesis 1 if you would in your
[52:25] Bibles got a ton of scriptures to go
[52:27] through tonight so I'm not going to
[52:29] expect you to keep up
[52:31] uh we're just going to go through them
[52:33] pretty quickly if you what if you can
[52:35] hit that's fine but Genesis 1 and also
[52:38] Genesis 8.
[52:39] in Ecclesiastes 3 I'd like to read
[52:43] as we open this service amen how many
[52:45] can say God is good
[52:47] all the time amen all the time praise
[52:51] the name of the Lord
[52:53] it says here in Genesis 1 14 and God
[52:56] said let there be lights in the
[52:58] firmament of the heaven to divide the
[53:01] day from the night and let them be for
[53:04] signs and for seasons and for days and
[53:07] for years and let them be for lights and
[53:09] the firming of the heaven to give light
[53:11] upon the Earth
[53:13] and it was so God made two great lights
[53:16] a great light to rule the day and a
[53:18] lesser light a greater light to rule the
[53:21] day and a lesser light to rule the night
[53:23] and he made the Stars also Genesis 8 22
[53:27] says while the Earth remaineth seed time
[53:30] and harvest cold and heat summer and
[53:34] winter day and night shall not cease
[53:39] Ecclesiastes 3 and verse 1 it says to
[53:42] everything
[53:44] there is a season and a time to every
[53:47] purpose under the heaven a time to be
[53:50] born and a time to die a time to plant a
[53:53] time to pluck up that which is planted A
[53:56] Time to Kill a time to heal a time to
[53:59] break down a time to build up a time to
[54:02] weep A Time To Laugh A Time to mourn and
[54:05] a time to dance a time to Cast Away
[54:08] Stones a time together the stones
[54:10] together a time to embrace a time to
[54:13] refrain from embracing a time to get a
[54:17] time to lose a time to keep a time to
[54:19] Cast Away a time to rent and a time to
[54:23] sow a time to keep silence and a time to
[54:26] speak a time to love and a time to hate
[54:30] a time of war and a time of Peace amen
[54:34] will let you be seated
[54:37] this evening
[54:39] I'd like to speak to you on the light
[54:41] the change of seasons
[54:46] amen this word season
[54:50] as we read here in Ecclesiastes 3
[54:53] is a certain time or a time set
[54:56] appointed by God for its being and
[55:00] continuance or for some something's
[55:03] being or continuance which no human
[55:06] intellect can alter
[55:09] Amen in other words what God has said in
[55:11] place there's nothing a man can do about
[55:14] it it's a season it's a declaration a
[55:17] certain time or appointed time the day
[55:21] that we are in today as we see as the
[55:24] evening Shadows are falling will give
[55:26] place tonight
[55:28] and as through the night as it would go
[55:30] it again it'll turn today is it summer
[55:34] it'll be winter is it winter stay a
[55:37] while it'll be summer again but every
[55:40] purpose has its time and every time has
[55:45] its purpose
[55:46] the clearest Sky will become clouded and
[55:49] the most clouded Sky will clear up and
[55:52] the sun will burst from behind the
[55:54] clouds those things which seem to be
[55:57] just usual everyday occurrences are in
[55:59] the council and foreknowledge of
[56:02] almighty God punctually determined or in
[56:05] other words us a certain time that is
[56:08] determined and the Very hour of them is
[56:10] fixed it neither can be anticipated or
[56:14] can be delayed a moment
[56:16] amen there's a time to be born as we
[56:19] read in a time to die these are
[56:21] determined by the Divine counsel and as
[56:24] we're born and if time tarries we must
[56:27] die
[56:28] at the time appointed as he would say in
[56:31] Acts 17 and verse 26 and hath made of
[56:34] one blood all nations of men for to
[56:37] dwell on all the face of the Earth and
[56:40] has determined the times before
[56:42] appointing and the bounds of their
[56:45] habitation
[56:46] so our time on Earth is already set by
[56:49] God
[56:50] amen Satan cannot add another moment to
[56:53] it or take a moment from it amen God has
[56:56] placed that there you know some observe
[56:58] that here is a time to be born in the
[57:01] scripture that we read there's some of
[57:03] some some Scholars look at and said
[57:05] here's a time to be born and a time to
[57:07] die but no time to live
[57:10] but his time is so short that that time
[57:13] is not even worth mentioning and of
[57:15] course soon as we are born we begin to
[57:19] die
[57:20] but as there is time there is a time to
[57:22] be born and a time to die so there is a
[57:25] time to rise out of the grave again a
[57:28] set time when those that lie in the
[57:30] grave shall be remembered he said it in
[57:34] jobs 14 and verse 13 He said oh that
[57:37] thou would has hide me in the grave and
[57:39] thou would just keep me secret until thy
[57:42] wrath be passed that thou would have
[57:44] support me a set time and remember me
[57:48] amen there's a time for men to plant a
[57:50] time of year as we're coming into the
[57:53] springtime as a time of planting
[57:55] and even in our lives we go through
[57:58] these things and we'll get through too
[58:00] there's a time in our life for planting
[58:02] there's a time in our life we're
[58:03] harvesting there's a time that Amen to
[58:05] be that it'll grow that things uh that
[58:07] have been planted will be grown will
[58:09] grow fruitless and useless and there in
[58:12] those times is to be plucked up you know
[58:15] we can continue down the verse but the
[58:17] point is everything has a time and has a
[58:21] season and in your life there's a higher
[58:23] power orchestrating when things happen
[58:26] and just as the son orchestrates on the
[58:29] earth when summer comes or when winter
[58:31] is decreed amen has set a certain time
[58:33] in a certain season and that excuse me
[58:37] that son is setting now that decree so
[58:40] also is there a higher power
[58:43] orchestrating when you go through
[58:45] seasons of your life just as the lights
[58:48] in heaven have dictated the season on
[58:51] Earth your father in Heaven is also
[58:53] dictating and changing the seasons in
[58:56] your life
[58:57] so in order to fully experience God's
[59:00] peace you know throughout the many
[59:02] storms of life we must discern and
[59:04] accept and appreciate the perfect timing
[59:08] of God God fulfills his will in each
[59:11] individual's life in his own perfect
[59:14] time now I want you to understand there
[59:17] is a time but it's not our time it's
[59:19] God's time amen God is in control so God
[59:22] fulfills his will and each individual's
[59:25] life in his own perfect time so we have
[59:28] to give ourselves to God's timing amen
[59:32] God knows the time that we're in and the
[59:34] time that we need to be in amen and so
[59:36] as we see in this Earth We're very aware
[59:39] of Four Seasons there's winter and
[59:41] there's spring and there's summer and
[59:43] there's fall uh you know as we say in
[59:46] Louisiana sometimes you can go through
[59:47] all four seasons in one day but you know
[59:51] all of those have a certain purpose and
[59:53] a certain thing that happens and I I got
[59:55] to study in a little bit on these
[59:56] seasons
[59:58] yeah
[59:59] and you know winter is what we're just
[1:00:01] coming out of is a lot a lot known as a
[1:00:04] lot of jury times and a lot maybe a lot
[1:00:06] of rainy times and a lot of cold times
[1:00:09] and and it's marked as being a long and
[1:00:11] dreary season and and and some people
[1:00:14] kind of like parts of the winter but
[1:00:16] many times it gets very long and bearing
[1:00:18] upon your heart but you know it is also
[1:00:21] I didn't realize this until looking at
[1:00:23] it is a time that inner growth happens
[1:00:25] in trees and plants amen God is even in
[1:00:29] those long dreary moments amen
[1:00:31] accomplishing something inside that may
[1:00:34] not see out on the outside you know we
[1:00:36] love to see the blooms and the fruit but
[1:00:38] amen if we didn't have that inner growth
[1:00:40] in our life you would never see the
[1:00:42] blooms you'd never see the fruit and so
[1:00:45] it represents a time of an examination
[1:00:47] of a heart or an examination of our
[1:00:50] motives or you find yourself in a winner
[1:00:52] and a dreary time it's a time that you
[1:00:54] set aside your life to examine your
[1:00:56] motive and examine your heart as a time
[1:00:59] of allowing God to make changes in us
[1:01:02] it's a time for a strengthening up and a
[1:01:05] maturing
[1:01:06] Springtime is a wonderful time of the
[1:01:09] year many of us love it it's marked as a
[1:01:11] time of cleansing you know we're at the
[1:01:13] time of spring cleaning a restoration
[1:01:16] from the difficult days of Winter the
[1:01:18] soil rotates as the refreshing rains
[1:01:21] it's a time of transition it's a time of
[1:01:24] but it's also still a time of pruning
[1:01:26] and regrowth it represents a time of joy
[1:01:30] and glory after a time of being dormant
[1:01:33] and going through hardships but there's
[1:01:36] also in that a time of pruning this is a
[1:01:38] time when God is shaping and molding you
[1:01:41] in your life summer is marked as a time
[1:01:45] of extreme dryness and extreme heat
[1:01:48] there's a need in this time for more
[1:01:50] water than usual to better sustain life
[1:01:53] and strength and the top of the ground
[1:01:55] begins to crack from the heat it
[1:01:58] represents a time of spiritual dryness a
[1:02:01] time of needing more spiritual food than
[1:02:04] usual to stay replenished true
[1:02:06] Christians come out this season though
[1:02:08] stronger Others May stumble sometimes
[1:02:11] permanently in this stage but true
[1:02:14] Christians will come out of here
[1:02:16] stronger than ever before amen because
[1:02:19] those roots begin to grow deeper and
[1:02:21] deeper searching for that water that is
[1:02:24] in the earth amen fall you know is
[1:02:26] marked as a time of harvest but it's
[1:02:28] also a time of pruning and preparation
[1:02:31] for winter it leaves leaves fall from
[1:02:33] the trees it's also a time of transition
[1:02:36] it represents a time of harvest when the
[1:02:38] Christians bear their fruits but more
[1:02:40] correction and shaping from God is
[1:02:42] required to prepare the individual for
[1:02:45] The Long Winter season ahead but maybe
[1:02:48] you find yourself in Winter right now
[1:02:50] but don't worry there'll be another
[1:02:52] spring
[1:02:54] amen whatever you find yourself maybe
[1:02:56] you find yourself in a drive time and or
[1:02:59] in a dreary time or whatever time amen
[1:03:01] don't worry those seasons are going to
[1:03:03] change again in your life but just know
[1:03:06] that no matter what season you're in God
[1:03:08] is in that season
[1:03:10] God is there and he's working all things
[1:03:13] according to his good and so therefore
[1:03:15] we allow the season that you're in right
[1:03:17] now you must allow it to run its full
[1:03:20] course you can't stop it you can't you
[1:03:22] can't take days off of it nor will you
[1:03:24] add days to it it's all in God's Time by
[1:03:27] God is a good god and it's always his
[1:03:30] intentions his intention to bless you
[1:03:32] despite what season you find yourself
[1:03:35] facing hard times will bring forth good
[1:03:38] character in your life if you allow the
[1:03:41] god to perform his perfect will in your
[1:03:43] life so we are not to attempt to change
[1:03:46] the season but we are to allow the
[1:03:48] season to change us we allow God to
[1:03:52] change our lives no matter what we're in
[1:03:54] if we were to stay in that mindset that
[1:03:56] no matter what time we're in God is
[1:04:00] moving and God is walking with us and
[1:04:03] this time that I am in is decreed by
[1:04:06] almighty God this is where Paul was
[1:04:09] saying Philippians 4 11 he said that
[1:04:10] I've learned in whatever state I am
[1:04:13] there with to be content I know both how
[1:04:16] to be a base I know how to abound
[1:04:18] whether in and in all things I've
[1:04:21] instructed both to be full or to be
[1:04:23] hungry both to abound or suffer need I
[1:04:27] can do all things with through Christ
[1:04:29] with strength in me so what is our
[1:04:31] source of power if it's not Christ where
[1:04:34] do we get our source of power from amen
[1:04:36] amen so it comes from him our our
[1:04:40] strength comes from him our life comes
[1:04:43] from him and so the seasons of your life
[1:04:45] many times may become unbearable but
[1:04:48] don't carry your burdens
[1:04:51] don't carry your burdens they're far too
[1:04:53] heavy you must hand them over to the
[1:04:56] Lord and learn to trust God's promise
[1:04:58] and God's timing and his power will give
[1:05:02] you strength no matter what season you
[1:05:05] find yourself in
[1:05:07] amen so therefore by submitting yourself
[1:05:10] to God you can trust him to bring you
[1:05:12] through every trial you can trust him to
[1:05:15] bring you through every circumstance you
[1:05:17] can trust him in your sickness you can
[1:05:19] trust him in your health you can trust
[1:05:21] him in your poverty you can trust him
[1:05:23] when you need him or when you don't feel
[1:05:25] like you need him you trust him no
[1:05:27] matter what
[1:05:30] amen because he will exalt you in due
[1:05:33] time is what Peter said he said humble
[1:05:35] yourself before unto the mighty hand of
[1:05:37] God that he may exalt you in due time
[1:05:43] in other words in the right time the
[1:05:46] season will change
[1:05:48] amen but it's easy to get discouraged
[1:05:51] when facing a difficult season in life
[1:05:53] and how quickly we begin to think that
[1:05:56] the season we're in will last for
[1:05:59] eternity or we seem to be stuck in a
[1:06:01] hard place but if we believe we're in
[1:06:03] the hands of the one who decreed the
[1:06:05] seasons then no matter what season we're
[1:06:07] in he's in control amen therefore
[1:06:10] sometimes God is not not doesn't change
[1:06:13] your situation because he's trying to
[1:06:16] change your heart
[1:06:17] amen we remember there's different
[1:06:19] seasons of our life and we must let God
[1:06:22] do what he wants to do in each one of
[1:06:24] these Seasons Charles Spurgeon said it
[1:06:26] like this he said the seasons change and
[1:06:29] you change but the Lord abides the same
[1:06:32] forevermore and the streams of his lover
[1:06:35] deep and Broad and full as ever no
[1:06:39] matter what season you're in
[1:06:43] hallelujah amen God is in Sovereign
[1:06:46] control he's in control over ourselves
[1:06:48] the Lord God does as he pleases
[1:06:53] amen he alone is completely Sovereign
[1:06:55] there isn't anything else anything that
[1:06:58] happens to us in life that ever catches
[1:07:01] God by surprise
[1:07:05] amen I want the devil to know this was
[1:07:07] already together before I heard the news
[1:07:09] yesterday or the day amen nothing
[1:07:11] catches God by surprise this should give
[1:07:15] us so much comfort especially in times
[1:07:18] of great difficulty he not only is fully
[1:07:21] aware of whatever difficult season of
[1:07:23] life you're in amen but he has allowed
[1:07:26] it
[1:07:27] for his glory
[1:07:29] he has allowed it for his glory Psalms
[1:07:32] 135 says he does whatever pleases him
[1:07:36] throughout all of Heaven and Earth and
[1:07:38] in the deepest Seas saw Isaiah 46 10
[1:07:41] says declaring the end from the
[1:07:44] beginning and from the anxious time
[1:07:46] things which have been done not been
[1:07:47] done saying my purpose will be
[1:07:50] established and I will accomplish all my
[1:07:54] good pleasure
[1:07:55] [Music]
[1:07:57] amen I will accomplish all my good
[1:08:00] pleasure Hallelujah Daniel 4 35 says
[1:08:04] this
[1:08:06] all the inhabitants of the Earth are
[1:08:08] accounted as nothing
[1:08:10] but he does according to his will in the
[1:08:13] host of the heaven and among the
[1:08:15] inhabitants of the earth and no one can
[1:08:18] ward off his hand or say to him what
[1:08:21] have you done
[1:08:23] come on now
[1:08:25] what have you done job would say it like
[1:08:27] this we were were he to snatch away who
[1:08:31] could constrain him who could say to him
[1:08:34] what are you doing
[1:08:39] Hallelujah because he knows what he's
[1:08:41] doing
[1:08:43] he didn't get all the way to 2023 and
[1:08:46] get some Alzheimer's or some
[1:08:48] forgetfulness and forget what he's doing
[1:08:50] no he knows what he's doing
[1:08:53] and he's in control of every season and
[1:08:57] every situation of your life
[1:09:02] Psalms 29 10 says it like this the Lord
[1:09:06] sits enthroned over the flood
[1:09:09] amen
[1:09:12] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:09:16] the Lord sits upon the flood
[1:09:19] that's enough right there to just have a
[1:09:21] good old dance
[1:09:23] you may feel like the enemy is flooding
[1:09:26] over your life but don't forget who's
[1:09:28] sitting over the flood
[1:09:30] who's in control of that enemy has come
[1:09:33] against you the Lord sits and Throne of
[1:09:36] the flood the Lord is enthroned as king
[1:09:39] forever
[1:09:42] the lord giveth strength to his people
[1:09:45] and the Lord blesses his people with
[1:09:48] peace
[1:09:50] First Chronicles 29 12 says wealth and
[1:09:53] honor come from you you are the ruler of
[1:09:56] all things
[1:09:59] excuse me in your hand our strength and
[1:10:01] power to exalt and give strength to all
[1:10:04] now our God we give thanks praise your
[1:10:08] glorious name so he has power in his
[1:10:10] hand over every life
[1:10:13] amen if he says one says furthermore
[1:10:15] because we are united with Christ we
[1:10:18] have received an inheritance from God
[1:10:20] for he chose us in advance and he makes
[1:10:23] everything work out according to his
[1:10:27] plan
[1:10:28] so every season of your life is working
[1:10:31] according to his plan it might not be
[1:10:33] your plan
[1:10:34] but it's his plan
[1:10:37] it might not be what you was expecting
[1:10:39] amen what you was looking for but it's
[1:10:42] what he has decreed
[1:10:46] but God Is With Us in every season of
[1:10:50] our life
[1:10:51] I want to I want to drive this home he
[1:10:54] loves you so completely
[1:10:58] therefore his love out of his love he
[1:11:01] will never leave you he will never
[1:11:03] abandon you when you face difficult
[1:11:06] times you will never face them along
[1:11:10] he will walk with you through the
[1:11:12] darkness he will rejoice with you
[1:11:14] through the good times God does not send
[1:11:17] us on a hard path to find our way
[1:11:19] without him he is with you every moment
[1:11:23] and he's helping you every step
[1:11:26] Isaiah 43 says it like this I am the
[1:11:29] Lord your Holy One the creator of Israel
[1:11:32] your king thus saith the Lord who makes
[1:11:35] a way to the sea and a path through
[1:11:38] Mighty Waters Joshua 1 9 says have not

[1:12:51] anoint men to try to take his land amen
[1:12:53] we're not facing physical enemies we're
[1:12:55] facing a spiritual enemy therefore we
[1:12:58] fight a spiritual warfare so let's put
[1:13:00] it in our language the Lord is with me I

[1:13:27] alone you're by yourself you know nobody
[1:13:30] cares for you nobody understands look at
[1:13:33] all this enemy well I want you to start
[1:13:34] looking at that enemy not with defeated
[1:13:37] eyes I want you to start looking with
[1:13:39] triumphantize and say I'm going to come
[1:13:42] out of this I'm going to move to another
[1:13:44] place
[1:13:46] God is in control and God has me in his
[1:13:50] hands
[1:13:57] behold God is my helper
[1:14:00] the Lord is a sustainer of my soul
[1:14:04] time is in God's hands
[1:14:08] far too often we get frustrated with God
[1:14:10] because we're not it's not happening on
[1:14:13] our timeline
[1:14:15] we think that we know better than he
[1:14:17] does and we get impatient
[1:14:19] therefore get an impatient begins to
[1:14:22] lead to depression and anxiety and
[1:14:26] we begin to speak the devil's language
[1:14:30] I just want to die
[1:14:32] I want to live
[1:14:37] I want to live because I know there's a
[1:14:39] great thing about to happen upon this
[1:14:41] Earth
[1:14:42] and I plan on being a part of it
[1:14:45] amen amen so but we get the depression
[1:14:49] comes in anxiety but God is in perfect
[1:14:52] control of what is happening including
[1:14:55] the timing of the Season you're in
[1:14:59] amen Ecclesiastes 3 11 says he has made
[1:15:02] everything beautiful in its time or his
[1:15:06] time
[1:15:08] Amen in his time and he has also said
[1:15:12] eternity in the human heart yet no one
[1:15:14] can fathom what God has done from the
[1:15:17] beginning to the end
[1:15:20] but he has made everything beautiful in
[1:15:23] his time
[1:15:28] but you need to look at yourself and
[1:15:29] quit looking at yourself with some
[1:15:30] withering plant
[1:15:33] and start looking at yourself at what
[1:15:35] God planted there
[1:15:37] that was a seed ordained for life
[1:15:42] amen you might be going through a dry
[1:15:44] season and fill all weather but don't
[1:15:46] worry rains are coming
[1:15:48] [Applause]
[1:15:49] amen what you need to start looking at
[1:15:51] is not the season around you but start
[1:15:53] looking at the seed that's on the inside
[1:15:55] of you that was placed there before the
[1:15:57] foundation of the world and it was
[1:15:59] ordained for life
[1:16:02] and there ain't nothing the devil can do
[1:16:04] about it he can't cut it one day short
[1:16:07] [Applause]
[1:16:10] you say well I don't feel very beautiful
[1:16:12] he said he has made everything beautiful
[1:16:15] in his time
[1:16:20] Psalms 31 says my times are in your
[1:16:24] hands
[1:16:25] deliver me from the hands of my enemies
[1:16:28] from those who pursue me let your faith
[1:16:31] shine upon your servant and Save Me In
[1:16:34] Your unfailing Love
[1:16:37] have a cook 2 and verse 3 says for the
[1:16:40] vision is yet for the appointed time
[1:16:47] but if it's a vision of God it will come
[1:16:50] to pass
[1:16:52] and you can line every devil up you want
[1:16:54] to and they'll not be able to stop it
[1:16:56] from coming to pass
[1:16:59] amen they tried it at the grave amen
[1:17:02] Resurrection morning they tried to seal
[1:17:04] it they tried to line them all up put an
[1:17:07] encampment around them but a vision that
[1:17:09] spoke
[1:17:10] I'll not suffer my Holy One Amen to seek
[1:17:14] corruption he said you Reign you destroy
[1:17:16] this temple in three days I'll raise it
[1:17:18] up again
[1:17:19] amen and a vision has spoke over that
[1:17:22] body and every devil is trying to hold
[1:17:25] him in hell but when it came time for
[1:17:27] that Vision to come to life there wasn't
[1:17:30] a devil that could do anything about it
[1:17:33] there was a word that had spoken let me
[1:17:35] tell you there's a word spoken for every
[1:17:37] one of your lives
[1:17:40] come all children of God and Devils can
[1:17:43] try to Camp down and they can try to
[1:17:45] clamp down all they want to but the
[1:17:48] vision shall come to pass
[1:17:51] will be a bride without spot without
[1:17:53] wrinkle
[1:17:57] foreign
[1:18:02] 6 says for there is a proper time
[1:18:06] and procedure for every Delight
[1:18:09] though a man's trouble is heavy upon him
[1:18:12] if no one knows what will happen
[1:18:15] who can tell him when it will happen
[1:18:19] man's got it all figured out
[1:18:23] we ain't got nothing figured out
[1:18:26] but he does
[1:18:31] as we read in Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes
[1:18:34] 3 there's a time for everything and a
[1:18:37] season for every purpose
[1:18:40] so God's purpose will be fulfilled
[1:18:45] it doesn't matter how dry you feel
[1:18:48] doesn't matter how dreary you feel
[1:18:51] feelings has nothing to do with it
[1:18:55] churches go through seasons
[1:18:58] people go through seasons of life
[1:19:02] but God as in control of every season so
[1:19:06] if we'll quit looking at the situations
[1:19:08] around us and and all the things that's
[1:19:11] going on around us but but brother
[1:19:13] Timothy I'm waiting so long
[1:19:17] you know many times we find ourselves in
[1:19:19] a season of waiting
[1:19:21] we're waiting on the Lord to redeem us
[1:19:25] for my art to help us in a hard
[1:19:26] situation or
[1:19:28] uh you know maybe waiting for some
[1:19:31] Financial boost
[1:19:33] we're often Waiting for God for many
[1:19:35] things but it's in those seasons of
[1:19:38] waiting
[1:19:39] God is there
[1:19:41] he is using those times just to speak as
[1:19:44] if as effectively as he uses the good
[1:19:47] times or any time he is transforming us
[1:19:50] into the likeness of Christ and the
[1:19:52] times of waiting are not wasted
[1:19:56] amen the times of waiting are not wasted
[1:20:01] they are part of the process his process
[1:20:07] but as in times of waiting man we get
[1:20:09] discouraged and we're like well it ain't
[1:20:10] for me
[1:20:12] no it's time you just wait on the Lord
[1:20:14] and say God I'm still here
[1:20:18] amen he said amen he said him that
[1:20:20] knocketh and keep on knocking
[1:20:24] you might be still waiting but I'm still
[1:20:26] here knocking

[1:20:30] seeking amen you might have salt but you
[1:20:32] need to keep on seeking
[1:20:35] amen waiting upon the Lord that is not a
[1:20:38] wasted moment

[1:21:06] matter what you feel like it's what his
[1:21:08] word said
[1:21:09] psalms 27 said wait for the Lord but be
[1:21:12] strong let your heart be strong but yes
[1:21:15] wait for the Lord Psalm first Samuel 12
[1:21:17] says now stand here and see the great
[1:21:20] thing that the Lord is about to do
[1:21:24] but what if we walk away just before the
[1:21:27] moment

[1:21:32] to change
[1:21:34] you don't know when the author is going
[1:21:36] to pick up the pen and write another
[1:21:38] line in your life or flip a chapter over
[1:21:40] you don't know
[1:21:43] but you have to wait and say God I'm

[1:22:16] head to a believer in Jesus Christ you
[1:22:19] don't know when that moment is
[1:22:22] but you stay there until that moment
[1:22:24] comes
[1:22:35] 37 7 says Be Still
[1:22:37] in the presence of the Lord and wait
[1:22:39] patient for patiently for him to act
[1:22:44] don't worry about evil people who
[1:22:46] prosper

[1:23:15] work in you will perfect it unto the day

[1:24:09] breathing room for my soul an
[1:24:12] impregnable Castle I am set for life

[1:24:33] I'm looking at a people that are set for
[1:24:36] life
[1:24:37] amen demons may be holling and people
[1:24:40] may be making all kind of evil plans but

[1:25:16] let me tell you he can evaporate just
[1:25:18] like that
[1:25:25] half of people's 401ks evaporated in the
[1:25:28] last couple of years
[1:25:33] it can be gone
[1:25:39] but the life I want to be set for
[1:25:41] is that life
[1:25:44] Luke 1 4 45 and said blessed
[1:25:47] is she that believed
[1:25:50] for there shall be a performance of
[1:25:52] those things which were told unto her
[1:25:55] from the Lord
[1:25:59] do we have any she's here that's
[1:26:00] believers
[1:26:02] the Bride of Jesus Christ blessed is she
[1:26:05] that believe for there shall be a
[1:26:07] performance
[1:26:08] Hallelujah Exodus 14 says the Lord will
[1:26:11] fight for you and all you have to do is
[1:26:14] keep still
[1:26:18] amen
[1:26:21] but there's something to remember when
[1:26:22] seasons change
[1:26:25] and seasons of life change no matter how
[1:26:28] much chaos surrounds her you must stand
[1:26:31] firm on the word
[1:26:33] God is faithful
[1:26:36] he keeps all promises he is always with
[1:26:39] us he will never abandon us he is our
[1:26:43] anchor he is our strength he never
[1:26:45] changes and he is changing us into
[1:26:47] something better
[1:26:50] hallelujah amen don't forget he's always
[1:26:54] there Psalms 95 and verse 4 in one hand
[1:26:57] he holds deep caves and caverns and in
[1:27:00] the other hand he grafts the high
[1:27:02] mountain Deuteronomy 31 says be strong
[1:27:05] and courageous do not be afraid or
[1:27:07] terrified for the Lord your God goes
[1:27:09] with you he will never leave you or
[1:27:12] forsake you
[1:27:18] Hebrews 6 says we have this hope
[1:27:22] as an anchor for the soul
[1:27:25] firm and secure
[1:27:30] Jesus Christ Hebrews 13 8 is Jesus
[1:27:33] Christ the same yesterday
[1:27:35] today and forever
[1:27:38] Isaiah 43 says behold I will do a new
[1:27:41] thing
[1:27:42] and now it shall spring forth shall you
[1:27:44] not know it I'll even make a way in the
[1:27:47] wilderness and rivers in the desert in
[1:27:49] other words he's in the mountains he's
[1:27:51] in the Seas he's in the rivers he's in
[1:27:54] the deserts
[1:27:56] he's where there's no water he's where
[1:27:58] there is water
[1:28:00] he's where you're on a mountain top and
[1:28:03] you can't do nothing but shout the
[1:28:04] glories of God but he's also down in the
[1:28:07] valley
[1:28:09] and all you can see is great impossible
[1:28:11] heels all around God is still there
[1:28:16] this is what are you trying to show
[1:28:19] Psalms 91 and verse 1 says he that
[1:28:21] dwelleth in the secret place of the most
[1:28:24] high shall abide in the shadow of the
[1:28:26] Almighty
[1:28:27] I will say of the Lord he is my refuge
[1:28:31] and my Fortress my God in him what I
[1:28:33] trust surely he shall deliver thee From
[1:28:36] The snower Snare of the Fowler and from
[1:28:38] the noise of pestilence so in other
[1:28:40] words when the snare is there he's there
[1:28:43] when the pestilence is there he's there
[1:28:45] he will cover thee with his wings and
[1:28:48] under his feathers and under his wings
[1:28:49] shalt thou trust his truth shall be thou
[1:28:52] shield and buckler Thou shalt not be
[1:28:54] afraid for the terror by night nor the
[1:28:56] air that flies by day nor the pestilence
[1:28:58] that walketh in darkness nor the
[1:29:00] destruction that wasted at noon day so
[1:29:02] and the terror he's there
[1:29:05] if when The Heirs are flying he's there
[1:29:08] amen when the pestilence is walking
[1:29:10] around in darkness he's there when
[1:29:13] destruction is all around he's there a
[1:29:16] thousand may fall at thy side and ten
[1:29:19] thousand at thy right hand but it shall
[1:29:21] not come neither
[1:29:24] because he's there
[1:29:29] Philippians 4 19 and said with all his
[1:29:32] abundant wealth through Christ Jesus my
[1:29:35] God
[1:29:36] will supply all thy needs
[1:29:42] so when you're needy he's there
[1:29:50] another thing to remember is
[1:29:52] in every season
[1:29:54] his Love Remains the Same
[1:29:58] just because you're in a winner does not
[1:30:00] mean God don't love you
[1:30:04] just because you're in dry times of life
[1:30:06] that doesn't mean God doesn't love you
[1:30:12] love you and when you're in the spring
[1:30:13] and everything's beautiful and flowers
[1:30:15] are blooming and the birds are singing
[1:30:16] that doesn't mean God loves you more
[1:30:20] his Love Remains the Same
[1:30:27] but you know that is that's the first
[1:30:29] thing the devil wants to come at you
[1:30:30] with when you go through a dry time or a
[1:30:33] dreary time or a hard time or a
[1:30:35] financial well God must not love you
[1:30:38] like he loves everybody else
[1:30:42] look at them prospering he's got a he
[1:30:45] must they must really if he must really
[1:30:47] favor them and love it no he's just
[1:30:49] teaching you something
[1:30:52] he's working something out in your life
[1:30:54] it's a season you're in but it don't
[1:30:57] mean it's going to stay that way
[1:31:00] you know I've been in a dry time I see
[1:31:02] all these others been jab jumping and
[1:31:04] shouting and carrying on what about me
[1:31:06] that what does God love them more no God
[1:31:09] loves you just the same
[1:31:11] but what he's wanting to show you is
[1:31:13] amen listen one of the one sermon I got
[1:31:16] was in a real crazy place I had to say

[1:32:19] it's in your dry time that you realize
[1:32:21] how important water is
[1:32:24] n't it's in your dry times you realize
[1:32:27] how important it is to be under the
[1:32:29] gusher of the Holy Ghost it's in your
[1:32:31] dry times well it's talking about that's
[1:32:32] where that sermon went to is with David
[1:32:34] amen he drank from that well of
[1:32:36] Bethlehem and he drank and he was there
[1:32:38] as a child he was there all kinds of
[1:32:39] times of his life but it was in those
[1:32:41] moments that it was surrounded and
[1:32:43] blocked off by Philistines that he
[1:32:46] realized hey if I could just give one
[1:32:48] more drink
[1:32:49] if I could have just one more taste of
[1:32:52] that water it was in that moment he
[1:32:54] realized the worth of that water
[1:32:57] that's why God allows you to go through
[1:33:00] sickness so you'll understand what is
[1:33:02] how much it's worth to be well
[1:33:04] [Applause]
[1:33:07] that's why it allows you to go through
[1:33:09] times of need and Times of hunger so
[1:33:11] you'll know what it's like to be on the
[1:33:13] other side and the worth of it all
[1:33:15] listen God has a purpose for everything
[1:33:20] [Applause]
[1:33:28] yeah
[1:33:31] God's love
[1:33:33] will never dwindle
[1:33:37] nor is it based on your performance
[1:33:44] Hallelujah
[1:33:45] God's love doesn't show partiality
[1:33:48] it doesn't falter God's love is eternal
[1:33:52] as he is
[1:33:53] God is love
[1:33:58] He Loves Us purely
[1:34:00] completely and perfectly Lamentations
[1:34:04] three says the Lord's unfailing love and
[1:34:07] mercy still continues
[1:34:10] fresh as the morning and sure as the sun
[1:34:14] rises
[1:34:19] somebody need to hear that tonight
[1:34:21] when you get up in the morning you see
[1:34:23] that Sunrise you need to think of the
[1:34:25] scripture he has unfailing love
[1:34:28] and his Mercy is going to still continue
[1:34:31] Hallelujah fresh as a morning and sure
[1:34:34] as the sun rise
[1:34:37] how many ever doubts that the sun's
[1:34:39] gonna rise
[1:34:42] so quit doubting that God loves you
[1:34:48] because the scripture says it says sure
[1:34:51] as the sun rise
[1:34:55] Psalms 36 says that your love Lord
[1:34:57] reaches to the heavens your faithfulness
[1:35:00] to the skies your righteousness is like
[1:35:03] the highest mountains and your Justice
[1:35:05] is like the great deep you Lord preserve
[1:35:08] both people and animals how Priceless is
[1:35:11] your unfailing love oh God people take
[1:35:14] refuge in the shadow of your wings
[1:35:19] First John 3 1 says see what great love
[1:35:21] the father has lavished on us that we
[1:35:24] should be called the children of God and
[1:35:27] that is what we are the reason the world
[1:35:29] doesn't know us is that it did not know
[1:35:32] him
[1:35:37] first John 4 7 says dear friends let us
[1:35:40] love one another
[1:35:41] for love comes from God and everyone
[1:35:44] that loves has been born of God and
[1:35:47] knows God first John 4 16 said we
[1:35:49] ourselves know and believe the love
[1:35:51] which God has for us God is love and
[1:35:54] those who live and love live in Union
[1:35:56] with God and God lives in Union with
[1:35:57] them
[1:35:58] there is no fear in love but perfect
[1:36:00] love drives out fear because fear has to
[1:36:04] do with punishment the one who fears is
[1:36:06] not made perfect in love
[1:36:11] Galatians 2 says I have been crucified
[1:36:13] with Christ and I don't no longer live
[1:36:16] but Christ lives in me the life that I
[1:36:18] now live in the body I live by the faith
[1:36:20] of the Son of God who love me
[1:36:23] and he gave himself for me
[1:36:25] Jeremiah 31 3 says the Lord has appeared
[1:36:28] of old unto me saying yea I have loved
[1:36:31] thee with an everlasting love
[1:36:34] therefore with loving kindness have I
[1:36:37] drawn thee to me myself
[1:36:40] scripture says no one shows Greater Love
[1:36:43] than he that lays his life down for his
[1:36:46] friend
[1:36:49] we know what he did that's what he did
[1:36:51] for us he laid his life down
[1:36:55] God but God is good
[1:36:58] in every season
[1:37:01] and in every season God is good
[1:37:04] he cares for you in every season even if
[1:37:07] this season of life herein is hard he is
[1:37:10] carefully chosen what sort of season it
[1:37:13] is not because he's punishing you
[1:37:16] but because he loves you and he wants
[1:37:19] you to grow so therefore in every season
[1:37:22] it's safe to put our trust in God
[1:37:29] Philippians 2 and verse 13 says for it
[1:37:32] is God who is at work in you it is God
[1:37:36] who is at work in you both the will and
[1:37:40] the work for his good pleasure so when
[1:37:42] it's your season to come forth nothing
[1:37:45] can stop it
[1:37:47] when it's your season to change nothing
[1:37:50] can do anything about it it's in God's
[1:37:53] hands it's in God's decree amen and if
[1:37:56] you are a child of God in the seed of
[1:37:58] God Amen just like he did amen when he
[1:38:01] saved your soul and it was a decree over
[1:38:03] your life you know what that decree was
[1:38:04] of over that season of your life to come
[1:38:07] to him he said all that the father
[1:38:09] giveth me shall come
[1:38:13] that was decree in a season over your
[1:38:16] life a time over your life that you may
[1:38:19] have laid in the muck a long time and
[1:38:20] you may have laid under dirt a long time
[1:38:22] a man laid out there in sin a long time
[1:38:25] but there was a decree for a certain
[1:38:27] season of your life to come forth
[1:38:31] oh my about this time I wish I had voice
[1:38:34] to preach amen but listen no man can
[1:38:37] come to me except the father draw him
[1:38:39] and I will raise him up at the last day
[1:38:42] amen I will raise him I will pull him I
[1:38:45] will call him
[1:38:47] in his time and in his season
[1:38:56] this is out of the church age book he
[1:38:58] said but as many as received them to him
[1:39:01] gave you power to become sons of God
[1:39:03] even them that believed on his name
[1:39:05] which were born not of the blood nor the
[1:39:07] will of Flesh nor the will of man but of
[1:39:08] God
[1:39:10] Ephesians 1 4 said according as he has
[1:39:14] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:39:16] of the world that we should be holy and
[1:39:17] Without Blame before him love having
[1:39:19] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:39:22] children by Jesus Christ himself
[1:39:24] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:39:26] will
[1:39:27] so it's according to the good pleasure
[1:39:30] of his will
[1:39:32] amen see Jesus Christ is choosing his
[1:39:35] own bride just the same as men choose
[1:39:38] their Brides today a bride doesn't
[1:39:40] simply decide she's going to take a
[1:39:42] certain man for a husband no sir it's
[1:39:44] the groom who decides and chooses a
[1:39:47] certain woman for a bride John 15 16
[1:39:49] says you have not chosen me but I have
[1:39:53] chosen you
[1:39:55] Hallelujah so now according to the word
[1:39:58] the bride was chosen you were chosen to
[1:40:01] be decreed in a certain season at a
[1:40:03] certain time
[1:40:06] amen and there's nothing the devil could
[1:40:08] do about it
[1:40:10] he couldn't stop you if he wanted to
[1:40:13] he couldn't turn you around if he wanted
[1:40:15] to he couldn't make you quit if he
[1:40:18] wanted to amen he God has said all that
[1:40:21] God has giveth me shall come
[1:40:25] so just as the sun begins to draw upon
[1:40:28] the grass seed that is laid dormant for
[1:40:30] you for months and months and seemed to
[1:40:32] be dead and withered away and no life
[1:40:34] but the sun in a certain season begins
[1:40:37] the size a certain way and it begins to
[1:40:40] warm up the atmosphere and things begin
[1:40:42] to change
[1:40:44] all of a sudden now that ground pops out
[1:40:47] that grass
[1:40:50] it may have been stomped over by cows it
[1:40:53] may have been Bush Hogs it may have been
[1:40:55] torn apart but that sun has decreed it's
[1:40:58] going to live
[1:41:00] pulls it right out of the ground
[1:41:03] Lord glory to God you may be in a season
[1:41:06] of your life and it may seem to be all
[1:41:09] withering away and all going down to
[1:41:11] nothing but let me tell you your season
[1:41:13] is about to change
[1:41:15] the sun is Rose where there's a son of
[1:41:18] righteousness in the road with healing
[1:41:21] in his wings
[1:41:22] and he has decreed all the father hath
[1:41:25] given me shall come
[1:41:28] why are you coming you can't help it
[1:41:30] there's something pulling you from
[1:41:31] another atmosphere
[1:41:33] why are you becoming who you are you
[1:41:35] can't help but there's something pulling
[1:41:37] you from another atmosphere there's a
[1:41:39] drawing there's something taking place
[1:41:46] he said in Romans 9 and verse 11 that
[1:41:49] the purpose of God according to election
[1:41:51] might stand he said he can't read it no
[1:41:54] other way
[1:41:55] the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of
[1:41:57] God
[1:42:00] so
[1:42:01] there's a season or a Time
[1:42:05] for every time for every season
[1:42:08] or purpose
[1:42:13] so God has a purpose
[1:42:16] and he has one purpose
[1:42:18] was take a bride
[1:42:21] of his own chosen
[1:42:26] you are here fulfilling the purpose of
[1:42:29] God
[1:42:31] it ain't your choosing
[1:42:35] no more than any of you could choose
[1:42:37] when you was born if it's going to be
[1:42:39] blonde-headed black-headed
[1:42:42] redheaded
[1:42:45] couldn't choose that
[1:42:46] you couldn't choose if he was going to
[1:42:48] be five foot eleven
[1:42:50] or four foot two you couldn't choose it
[1:42:57] hey Mitch has got to be saved too
[1:43:01] you couldn't choose it
[1:43:04] is what it is
[1:43:08] it does not matter you could not choose
[1:43:10] it
[1:43:15] okay maybe it's more problems say little
[1:43:17] people
[1:43:19] they got to be saved too
[1:43:21] but I find that little people come with
[1:43:24] big personalities and the Napoleon
[1:43:26] complexes and all kinds of stuff
[1:43:30] and they know everything know all about
[1:43:31] it I don't know why I went there but I
[1:43:33] did
[1:43:35] they got it all figured out
[1:43:38] now you got nothing figured out
[1:43:41] I don't care if you're seven foot eleven
[1:43:42] you ain't got nothing figured out
[1:43:45] God is the only decreeing it in his
[1:43:47] season
[1:43:50] he says watch carefully he said before
[1:43:51] there was ever a speck of Stardust
[1:43:54] before God was God because that's an
[1:43:56] object of worship
[1:43:58] and there was no one to worship he was
[1:43:59] only known as eternal spirit the bride
[1:44:05] was already in his mind
[1:44:09] Hallelujah don't you understand God when
[1:44:11] he created the Earth he was creating him
[1:44:13] a garden
[1:44:16] listen the trees and all that are
[1:44:18] wonderful and they're beautiful in the
[1:44:19] mountains and this that and the other
[1:44:20] but you know the seeds that he really
[1:44:22] wanted to plant was his own seeds
[1:44:26] and he was planting them all out this
[1:44:28] one I'm going to put in this season and
[1:44:30] this one I'm going to put in this season
[1:44:31] oh that's going to be real good right
[1:44:33] there you know why because he's going to
[1:44:34] be born in a certain Nation a certain
[1:44:36] character and I'm going to be able to
[1:44:37] mold it just right and I'm going to be
[1:44:39] able to tear Satan's kingdom down
[1:44:43] look at all these seeds I've spread out
[1:44:45] there in laodicea the devil's made it so
[1:44:48] hard to live and so unrighteousness all
[1:44:51] around amen but I put them there for a
[1:44:53] certain purpose there's something on the
[1:44:55] inside of them that's that Eternal seed
[1:44:58] Drive of life on the inside of them
[1:45:00] they're going to come forth I don't care
[1:45:02] come on Devils open it all up bring them
[1:45:04] all down do whatever you want to they're
[1:45:07] still going to live
[1:45:09] to serve me that's
[1:45:10] that's above it
[1:45:14] he planned his garden
[1:45:17] no different you would sell on plant
[1:45:19] corn here I'm gonna plant taters here
[1:45:21] I'm gonna put this over here I'm gonna
[1:45:23] put Joe Adams right here I'm gonna put
[1:45:25] this one right here Paul you're gonna be
[1:45:27] over there Moses you're right here they
[1:45:29] all come up in their decreed season
[1:45:37] and there wasn't nothing
[1:45:39] Satan could do to stop them coming
[1:45:43] or to stop them while they were here
[1:45:50] Hallelujah anyhow
[1:45:53] he's a down to the century as we could
[1:45:55] go we can find Moses Jeremiah John the
[1:45:58] Baptist each one of these were God's
[1:46:00] Eternal thoughts expressed in its season
[1:46:05] then we come to Jesus to love us he was
[1:46:07] the perfect and complete thought
[1:46:09] expressed and he became known as the
[1:46:11] word that is what he is and forever will
[1:46:13] be now it says that he has chosen Us in
[1:46:17] him before the foundation of the world
[1:46:19] that means that we were right there with
[1:46:22] them in this mind and thoughts before
[1:46:24] there ever was a world
[1:46:29] before there ever was a speck of
[1:46:31] Stardust
[1:46:34] God had you in his mind
[1:46:38] so what makes you think if he's been
[1:46:40] thinking about you way back then he's
[1:46:41] going to forget about you now
[1:46:47] he can't forget about you
[1:46:50] he said no more than a mother could
[1:46:51] forget her suckling babe they're
[1:46:53] forgetting about him now
[1:46:56] but he said I can't forget about you
[1:46:57] because your names is engraved in the
[1:47:00] palms of my hand
[1:47:03] he said even our natural birth
[1:47:06] is based upon election
[1:47:10] the female ovaries produced many many
[1:47:12] eggs
[1:47:13] the male's firm it produces Millions
[1:47:16] amen and there's one predestinating life
[1:47:20] ordained or maybe two or whatever Korean
[1:47:22] twins trip whatever it is there's only a
[1:47:24] few that are ordained there's an
[1:47:26] intelligence behind all of it
[1:47:29] or other words what would determine
[1:47:31] whether it's going to be a boy or a girl
[1:47:33] blonde or brunette light or dark
[1:47:38] but with these thoughts in mind
[1:47:42] think about Joshua and Caleb
[1:47:45] one out of a million
[1:47:48] we heard about Caleb so wonderfully at
[1:47:50] camp
[1:47:51] but what was it it was an expression of
[1:47:53] God's thought in a season
[1:47:55] God knew in that season there was going
[1:47:57] to be Anakin's there
[1:47:59] he knew there was going to be a mountain
[1:48:01] there so you know what he did he said I
[1:48:03] need me a Caleb
[1:48:05] I need somebody that's going to stand
[1:48:07] when everybody else walks away I need
[1:48:10] somebody that's going to stand no matter
[1:48:11] how it seems to be everybody's turned
[1:48:14] against them and everybody's walking a
[1:48:16] different direction it don't matter give
[1:48:18] me my mountain
[1:48:25] he says your Jesus told them in the New
[1:48:28] Testament your fathers did he man in the
[1:48:30] wilderness and they're all dead
[1:48:32] those parents that died were necessary
[1:48:34] were necessary as forefathers of the
[1:48:36] people whom Jesus was speaking to but
[1:48:38] they perished yet they were the election
[1:48:40] of God naturally as Jacob or Joshua and
[1:48:43] Caleb were spiritually but to go on
[1:48:45] these elect were not only the Eternal
[1:48:47] thoughts of God which should be
[1:48:49] expressed in flesh in their due season
[1:48:51] but these the same elect are called by
[1:48:53] another name
[1:48:55] I'll try to finish here therefore it is
[1:48:57] a promise forward therefore it is a
[1:48:59] faith that it might be by grace to the
[1:49:01] end promise might be sure is all seed
[1:49:03] not only that which is of the law but
[1:49:05] that which is also the faith of Abraham
[1:49:07] who is the father of us all
[1:49:10] Romans 9 7 says neither because they're
[1:49:13] talking about Jacob and Esau Jacob have
[1:49:15] I loved Esau have I hated
[1:49:17] and we know that we know what happened
[1:49:19] for the children being not born neither
[1:49:20] have done any good or evil but the
[1:49:22] purpose of God according to election
[1:49:23] might stand not it works but him to
[1:49:26] calleth it was said the Elder to serve
[1:49:28] the younger as the rent and Jacob have a
[1:49:29] love Esau have a hated Galatians 3 16
[1:49:32] now to Abraham and his sea were the
[1:49:34] promises made and the seeds as of many
[1:49:36] but as of one and to thy seed which is
[1:49:39] in Christ Galatians 3 29 and if you be
[1:49:41] Christ then you are Abraham's seed and
[1:49:44] heirs according to the promise so
[1:49:46] according to Romans 4 16 we find that
[1:49:48] God has given a sure promise to all of
[1:49:51] Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself and
[1:49:54] all believers under that designation
[1:49:55] because he said Abraham who is a father
[1:49:58] of us all therefore he goes on to not
[1:50:00] only narrow down his definition but to
[1:50:02] rather finalize it he said identify the
[1:50:05] seed singular with Jesus and counted the
[1:50:07] seed of children the children of promise
[1:50:10] and the promises it had to do with
[1:50:11] election and the chosen of God and that
[1:50:13] is exactly what we have been saying
[1:50:15] these who are the Royal Sea are the
[1:50:18] elect of God they are the predestinated
[1:50:21] for known of God and we're in his mind
[1:50:23] and in his thoughts in very plain
[1:50:25] language the true bride of Christ was in
[1:50:28] the mind of God eternally though not
[1:50:30] expressed each fourth came forth in the
[1:50:32] designated decreed season
[1:50:36] and as each member came forth it became
[1:50:39] expressed and it took its place in the
[1:50:41] body thus this for the Bride is a
[1:50:45] literal spoken word seed bride
[1:50:49] so you will come forth
[1:50:53] let me tell you devil you can't keep us
[1:50:56] from coming forth there will be a body
[1:50:59] change
[1:51:00] [Applause]
[1:51:08] he said well when did I become seed when
[1:51:10] I had an altar
[1:51:12] no no you was already seen therefore you
[1:51:15] could be reborn
[1:51:17] for only this seed can be reborn because
[1:51:20] we were seed is the reason we can be
[1:51:22] quickened in non-seed there's nothing to
[1:51:26] Quicken
[1:51:28] but you know
[1:51:30] a seed
[1:51:32] or we can call them a son or a daughter
[1:51:34] of God
[1:51:36] can go a long time
[1:51:38] before he recognizes that he is a son
[1:51:42] in fact a lot of true Christians are
[1:51:44] like the story of the baby eagle that
[1:51:46] was hatched out under a hen
[1:51:48] you know the ego is a type of a True
[1:51:50] Believer or the farmer took an egg from
[1:51:52] Eagle's Nest placed it under a hen
[1:51:55] but in due time
[1:51:58] all the eggs in the hen hatched out the
[1:52:00] baby chicks got along fine with the
[1:52:02] other the other hand but the little
[1:52:03] eagle
[1:52:04] he couldn't figure out what all the
[1:52:06] clucking and scratching for food and the
[1:52:08] manure pie was all about
[1:52:10] he managed to make a living
[1:52:13] but he's pretty confused about it all
[1:52:16] but in another season
[1:52:20] one day in another day from way up in
[1:52:23] the air mother Eagle that laid that egg
[1:52:25] spied that little Eagle on the ground
[1:52:27] and she swooped down with tremendous
[1:52:30] speed and screamed to the top of a voice
[1:52:31] for him to fly up to meet her he had
[1:52:34] never heard an eagle cry before but when
[1:52:37] he heard that first scream
[1:52:41] when he heard that first scream
[1:52:43] something in him stirred and he longed
[1:52:46] to launch out towards it
[1:52:49] but he was afraid to try and another
[1:52:52] mother that again that mother screams
[1:52:54] had a rise in the wind and follow me and
[1:52:57] he screamed back I'm afraid
[1:53:00] once more she's screamed out try with
[1:53:04] all you got try with all you got and
[1:53:06] beating those wings he hurled himself
[1:53:08] into the air answering the Cry of his
[1:53:10] mother he saw it off into the blue skies
[1:53:13] you see he always was an eagle
[1:53:16] he always was an eagle
[1:53:19] oh he might at one time acted like a
[1:53:21] chicken for a little while but he never
[1:53:23] could be satisfied but once he heard in
[1:53:27] that time in that season another cry
[1:53:30] from another rail something began to
[1:53:32] Quicken on the inside of him that's who
[1:53:35] I am that that's where I belong I never
[1:53:38] belonged here this world is not my hope
[1:53:41] I'm passing away through
[1:53:44] let me tell you Church in due season
[1:53:46] we're going to hear a trumpet sound and
[1:53:48] the dead in Christ is going to rise
[1:53:52] glory to God Amen devils are going to
[1:53:55] try to stop it they're going to try to
[1:53:57] build atmospheres to stop it they're
[1:53:59] going to try to do everything they can
[1:54:00] to keep her from happening but they
[1:54:02] won't do it
[1:54:04] because all of a sudden it is season in
[1:54:08] this time Dirk's going to be in a move

[1:54:42] of the spirit of the word
[1:54:45] ain't know that Earthly stuff going to
[1:54:47] satisfy him any longer
