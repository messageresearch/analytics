[31:48] deuteronomy chapter 20.
[31:51] amen my
[31:55] very special moments tonight amen to see
[31:58] what the lord has done in our midst and
[32:01] amen to put a little song on a heart
[32:03] amen that he's a waymaker
[32:06] amen he is a waymaker mercy
[32:09] praise the lord and we will just see
[32:12] here tonight as he made a way for israel
[32:16] and many through the bible it says in
[32:18] deuteronomy 20 and verse 1 when thou
[32:20] goest
[32:21] out to battle against thine enemies
[32:24] and see as horses and chariots and a
[32:27] people more
[32:28] than thou be not afraid of them
[32:31] for the lord thy god is with thee oh
[32:34] don't i just give you confidence
[32:36] as long as he's with me i'll not go
[32:38] unless you go with us amen
[32:40] which brought thee up out of the land of
[32:42] egypt
[32:43] and it shall be when thou when you are
[32:46] come nigh unto the battle
[32:48] that the priest shall approach and speak
[32:51] unto the people
[32:52] and shall say unto them hear o israel ye
[32:55] approach
[32:56] this day unto battle against your
[32:58] enemies
[32:59] let not your hearts faint fear not
[33:03] do not tremble neither be ye terrified
[33:07] because of them for the lord your god is
[33:10] he
[33:11] that goeth with you to fight for you
[33:14] against your enemies
[33:16] to save you amen we let you be seated
[33:20] amen just like to continue on the
[33:22] thought of let not your hearts
[33:24] faint fear not do not tremble
[33:28] neither be ye terrified because of them
[33:33] you know as he said here in the first
[33:35] verse he made it very clear in the first
[33:38] few
[33:39] uh words that they would have battles he
[33:42] said
[33:43] when thou goest out to battle against
[33:45] thine enemy
[33:47] everyone has battles and everyone has
[33:49] trials
[33:50] everyone it does not matter if you're
[33:52] saved or you're unsaved or
[33:54] if you're going to make it to heaven or
[33:55] you're not going to make it to heaven
[33:57] everyone
[33:58] has battles and trials no one is exempt
[34:02] everyone through the bible had times of
[34:04] testing had times of battles
[34:07] but all the testings and all the trials
[34:09] and all the battles
[34:11] didn't matter as long as god was there
[34:14] to fight them
[34:15] amen and when he is there everything
[34:18] else doesn't matter
[34:20] amen everything else doesn't matter you
[34:22] know brother branham would say it like
[34:24] this in the manifestation of the spirit
[34:26] he said i trust
[34:27] that god will heal every sick and
[34:30] crippled person in our midst that comes
[34:32] i believe he will if we can just
[34:34] only have faith in him the work is
[34:38] complete
[34:39] and he goes on to say something that's
[34:40] very uh
[34:42] you know very ticky tacky or not very
[34:44] important but
[34:45] he said i see it's very warm and sticky
[34:48] and said we can't govern the weather but
[34:50] god
[34:50] does that and he says but i'm happy to
[34:53] be in god's serve
[34:54] a service whether it's real real cold or
[34:57] real real hot
[34:59] it doesn't matter amen just so
[35:02] he's here that's all that matters
[35:05] and i believe you know if we could have
[35:07] that attitude towards anything whether
[35:09] it be the heater or the
[35:10] or the ac or whether we feel good or we
[35:12] don't feel good or
[35:14] or whether we feel like being here we
[35:16] don't feel like being here
[35:17] only thing that matters is if he's here
[35:20] or not
[35:21] and if he's here nothing else matters as
[35:23] long as he's here
[35:24] when he's in the house he's all that
[35:26] matters i know last wednesday i talked
[35:28] about a lot about what don't matter or
[35:30] what does not matter
[35:32] but what i want to speak more on tonight
[35:34] is what does matter
[35:36] because he is all that matters amen you
[35:39] know he said every sinner he said i
[35:41] don't care
[35:41] how dull you may feel or how black your
[35:44] life may be
[35:45] in the presence of christ you can live
[35:48] again
[35:49] because he's all that matters amen no
[35:52] matter how sick you are tonight that
[35:54] doesn't matter
[35:55] what matters as you get in his present
[35:58] and he is a god that can heal
[36:00] all of your diseases amen when he when
[36:03] when he is all that matters this is what
[36:05] he would tell the children of israel
[36:07] when you come against your enemies don't
[36:08] look at how many people there are
[36:11] how big the whole how many horses how
[36:12] many chariots how big the wall there are
[36:15] because that doesn't matter
[36:16] the only thing that matters in this
[36:18] equation is me
[36:21] and i am here with you to fight your
[36:23] battles amen
[36:24] a god that matters and an enemy that
[36:26] don't matter
[36:28] hallelujah a god that matters in the
[36:30] enemy that don't matter and you know
[36:32] hey brother braden would say it like
[36:33] this he said who is more important than
[36:36] jesus
[36:38] what's more important than this service
[36:40] than jesus
[36:41] it doesn't matter the songs or the music
[36:44] or or how many people's here or not here
[36:46] it does not matter who's here who's not
[36:48] here
[36:48] only thing that really matters is if
[36:50] he's here or not
[36:52] and we know that his word declared he
[36:53] would be here because he said where two
[36:55] or three
[36:56] are gathered in his name there will i be
[36:58] and so we know that he is here because
[37:00] his word
[37:01] says he's here he is the most important
[37:04] person
[37:05] that can ever knock at your door
[37:08] hallelujah i mean we might be very
[37:10] pleased you know if the president would
[37:12] come knock or
[37:13] some government official or somebody
[37:14] that we love very much
[37:16] but there's nobody more important that
[37:18] can knock at your door than jesus christ
[37:21] and he's here at every service knocking
[37:23] on hearts doors
[37:24] but you know that what really matters is
[37:26] you know brother brandon would
[37:27] illustrate it in that painting
[37:29] he would say you know the painting of
[37:30] jesus knocking on the door
[37:32] amen but you know why wouldn't he just
[37:34] open the door and go in and the artist
[37:35] said
[37:36] well it's because the latch is on the
[37:38] inside so what matters is you open the
[37:40] door amen
[37:41] and you allow him to come into your life
[37:44] and and to speak to you and to touch
[37:46] your heart
[37:46] amen a minister can study and a minister
[37:48] can apply himself
[37:50] amen he could give all he's got but what
[37:52] really matters is if you had taken and
[37:54] say that's my word
[37:55] that belongs to me he's speaking to my
[37:57] heart and what are you doing you're
[37:59] opening the door
[38:00] for god to come in and minister to you
[38:02] that's what matters amen
[38:04] it doesn't matter how many services you
[38:06] come to or how many services you don't
[38:08] come to
[38:09] amen but long as you get to jesus and
[38:12] god comes on the inside of you
[38:14] and begins to speak to your heart how by
[38:16] you opening the door amen i've seen
[38:18] ministers great ministers of god that
[38:20] would speak and
[38:21] and you'd think man the altars would be
[38:23] full or there'd be many hearts moved
[38:25] but in some way that was going on with
[38:26] the individuals or something was going
[38:28] on the church
[38:29] and people would not receive it it
[38:31] didn't mean it didn't come from god
[38:32] it didn't mean that god wasn't speaking
[38:34] to them but what mattered
[38:36] is they would not open the door and
[38:38] allow god to come in
[38:39] and i believe that's what we ought to do
[38:41] every service and say god
[38:43] in this service tonight i want to forget
[38:45] about everything else around me
[38:47] i want to forget about my troubles i
[38:49] want to forget about the trials
[38:51] i want to forget about the fuss i had on
[38:52] the way to church i want to forget about
[38:54] everything around me
[38:56] i want to focus in on you and when you
[38:59] come i want to open the door
[39:01] i want you to speak to me i i want you
[39:04] to touch me i
[39:05] i want you to change something in my
[39:07] life and if there be any vowel thing
[39:09] take it away
[39:10] if there be any sin reveal it to me
[39:12] whatever it is god i want you to have
[39:14] freedom
[39:15] in my heart and in my life amen here's
[39:18] the most important thing
[39:19] there is no one more important than
[39:21] jesus
[39:23] hallelujah there's no one that can touch
[39:26] you like jesus
[39:27] there is no one that can save you like
[39:29] jesus there is no one that can heal you
[39:32] like jesus
[39:35] oh praise the lord amen he had a little
[39:37] boy be anointed tonight to sing a song
[39:40] that he's a waymaker listen i want you
[39:43] to understand
[39:44] that was a very supernatural moment
[39:45] whether we realize it or not
[39:47] that a little boy would get something on
[39:49] his heart walk into a music room
[39:51] and say i got a song tonight i want to
[39:53] sing jesus
[39:54] is a waymaker hallelujah not even
[39:58] knowing
[39:58] that his mom is a grandma wanted a movie
[40:01] he wanted to come up and and wave to you
[40:03] and to testify and to show you amen what
[40:06] was it god
[40:07] moving on a little heart of a child and
[40:09] that child
[40:10] opening the door if we could have child
[40:13] like
[40:14] faith to just open the door and say god
[40:16] use me
[40:18] touch my heart change me because there's
[40:20] nobody like jesus
[40:22] there's nobody that can touch my heart
[40:24] like he touches me
[40:25] there's no one that's healed me like he
[40:27] healed me there's no one that saved me
[40:30] like he saved me i mean he can testify
[40:33] that tonight
[40:34] there's not a government there's not
[40:36] some kind of help program
[40:37] that's ever saved me like jesus saved me
[40:41] well hallelujah amen he is the most
[40:44] important thing
[40:45] in this building tonight
[40:49] your feelings are not important
[40:53] whether they feel good or they feel bad
[40:54] that's not important
[40:57] i know bad feelings they like to be
[40:58] elevated and their extent you know
[41:00] to be essential and we've seen a lot of
[41:02] things that were elevated in this last
[41:03] seven
[41:04] months to be essential that's not really
[41:06] essential
[41:08] amen we saw them elevate abortions to be
[41:11] essential we saw them elevate
[41:13] all kinds of things to be essential
[41:14] that's really not essential
[41:17] amen what was it demonic forces trying
[41:19] to push their way out
[41:21] and say i mean something i'm important i
[41:23] matter
[41:26] oh hallelujah but there is something
[41:28] very essential tonight
[41:29] you get to jesus that's the most
[41:32] essential thing you could ever
[41:34] have in this service you say well i
[41:35] don't feel like it that's not essential
[41:38] what's essential is i'm going to push
[41:40] past what i feel or don't feel
[41:43] how i feel or don't feel what i believe
[41:45] or don't believe
[41:46] i'm going to push past it until i can
[41:48] get a conference with god
[41:51] hallelujah because he's a waymaker
[41:54] amen he'll make a way through your
[41:55] problems and your financial struggles
[41:57] and
[41:58] and the situations that's bothering you
[41:59] tonight if you can get to him he'll make
[42:01] a way through it
[42:03] hallelujah but the whole armor of god is
[42:06] by faith
[42:07] everything of the christian church is a
[42:10] faith act
[42:11] everything's supernatural nothing is
[42:14] natural
[42:16] when it comes to the house of god and
[42:18] you know and that's where
[42:19] if we could catch that because you know
[42:21] that satan wants to come
[42:23] on our natural realms even when it
[42:26] pertains to church or what we get out of
[42:28] churches
[42:29] is more along on the natural rounds well
[42:31] i didn't feel nothing i
[42:32] i didn't i didn't see nothing happening
[42:34] i i didn't i didn't hear
[42:36] god must not have been there and so he's
[42:39] constantly against the natural things
[42:40] but
[42:41] we as believers know that's not our
[42:43] guidance that's not what guides us is
[42:45] what we can see
[42:46] taste fill smell or hear amen what
[42:48] guides us is a supernatural realm
[42:50] and we can look beyond a natural realm
[42:53] of maybe nothing going on or seemingly
[42:55] what we can see happening and look
[42:57] beyond what we can see into the unseen
[42:59] and realize
[43:00] there's a supernatural realm here
[43:02] tonight amen jesus is walking among us
[43:04] and there's angels walking among us
[43:06] there's things happening and things in
[43:08] other realms there's demonic there's
[43:10] spiritual battles going taking place
[43:13] amen spiritual battles that are taking
[43:15] place and so we get we begin
[43:17] we begin to look past the things that
[43:19] are natural
[43:20] because we should be operating by the
[43:22] supernatural
[43:24] amen the only thing we base on our our
[43:27] walk on is
[43:28] faith and what god said to be the truth
[43:31] and we look to the unseen
[43:33] and we call those things which are not
[43:35] as though they were
[43:36] like abraham did amen
[43:40] you know i got reminded of my own
[43:42] situation not like abraham's
[43:45] today with brother nate green and his
[43:47] wife being in the hospital and
[43:49] and the baby having issues and having to
[43:51] be flown to another hospital and
[43:52] he's got a wife and one and a baby in
[43:54] another and i know what that feels like
[43:56] i
[43:57] i know the the helplessness you feel
[44:00] and you feel so helpless what do i do
[44:02] how do i what
[44:03] what you know of course satan's in those
[44:05] moments of helplessness
[44:06] to try to attack you and begin to come
[44:09] against your mind and tell you all kinds
[44:11] of things and tell you
[44:12] you must have done something wrong for
[44:13] you to be going through this or
[44:15] you must have sinned really bad or god
[44:17] wouldn't have put this on you
[44:18] you must you must not be one of he tells
[44:20] you all kinds of things in those
[44:22] helpless natural moments
[44:24] but if you can look beyond the natural
[44:27] moment and realize there's something
[44:28] happening
[44:29] in the supernatural realm god is moving
[44:32] on your behalf
[44:34] hallelujah god is moving on your behalf
[44:39] i hope somebody can catch that tonight
[44:42] god is moving
[44:43] on your behalf
[44:46] i feel to say it again god is moving on
[44:50] your behalf
[44:52] even though you can't see nothing but
[44:54] natural things and natural feelings and
[44:57] natural responses god is moving on your
[45:00] behalf
[45:00] and he's all that matters
[45:05] hallelujah amen when i went to go there
[45:08] to the
[45:09] the to the walmart to pick up a few
[45:11] things you know the store tell it again
[45:13] because it got reminded i've seen the
[45:14] pictures today brother nathan and his
[45:16] wife
[45:17] it brought black flashbacks with the
[45:19] same thing little baby in a little
[45:20] bubble
[45:21] and the mama being able to touch it for
[45:22] a few moments and it's gone
[45:24] helplessness natural feelings yes they
[45:27] flood you
[45:28] but that's not what matters what matters
[45:31] is he's fighting for you
[45:33] [Music]
[45:36] hallelujah amen i remember as i walked i
[45:40] went down the road and turned on the
[45:41] radio and a preacher was reading a
[45:43] scripture
[45:44] and said abraham believed in god and i
[45:47] just caught that moment and i turned it
[45:49] off and
[45:50] began to worship the lord i said that's
[45:51] right abraham believes you god
[45:53] and i'm a son of abraham and if abraham
[45:56] can believe you when things looked
[45:58] impossible
[45:59] i can believe you when things look
[46:00] impossible i just saw my baby trying to
[46:03] struggle for a breath
[46:05] and turning purple and the doctor saying
[46:07] don't let him die here on me
[46:08] send him to another hospital a lot of
[46:10] feelings were going on natural things
[46:12] were happening but there was also
[46:14] something in the supernatural and that's
[46:16] all that mattered
[46:18] god was moving on my behalf and my
[46:20] wife's behalf
[46:21] and that's all that mattered god was
[46:23] fighting for me
[46:24] god was fighting for me to save me in
[46:27] the middle of my struggle
[46:28] and that's all that mattered
[46:30] [Music]
[46:32] hallelujah if you can look beyond
[46:34] tonight what you see
[46:36] and realize god is fighting for me
[46:40] god is working it out on my behalf god
[46:42] is here to save me
[46:44] god is here to heal me god is here to
[46:46] deliver me
[46:47] god is here to set me free
[46:50] oh hallelujah when you can realize he's
[46:53] doing it for me
[46:56] i i turned the radio off and began to
[46:59] praise the lord
[47:01] went back to the hospital room and i
[47:02] told sister i don't know
[47:04] what we're about to face but we're going
[47:06] to believe god
[47:08] and we're not going to look at monitors
[47:10] what the doctor says what anything else
[47:12] going on around us
[47:13] we're going to look at the promise and
[47:15] it got worse
[47:17] it didn't get better it got worse days
[47:20] of getting worse
[47:21] and worse more a ventilator and then an
[47:24] oscillator
[47:25] and just a baby that was paralyzed
[47:27] looked impossible
[47:28] and it got worse and worse and worse
[47:32] but god was working on our behalf
[47:35] hallelujah hey man he told me in that
[47:38] moment
[47:39] it ain't what you've done it's what i
[47:41] did
[47:44] hallelujah maybe somebody need that
[47:46] tonight it ain't what you've done is
[47:48] what he did
[47:50] under the blood of bulls and goats
[47:51] abraham's faults were all listed out
[47:53] but you turn over to the new covenant
[47:56] find one fault
[47:58] find one mistake they don't talk about
[48:00] abraham going down to egypt when god
[48:02] told him not to or lying
[48:04] he don't talk about any of his mistakes
[48:06] god was fighting his battles
[48:09] and god came down in the form of human
[48:11] flesh and took on human battles
[48:14] he took on abraham's faults he took on
[48:16] abraham's failures
[48:17] and he conquered them all and he said
[48:20] abraham staggered not at the promises of
[48:23] god
[48:23] but was strong in the faith
[48:26] hallelujah that's what it's telling you
[48:28] tonight you hadn't done nothing
[48:30] it's what i've done i've already
[48:33] conquered
[48:34] your problem already conquered your sin
[48:36] already conquered your sickness
[48:38] name any sickness it's already conquered
[48:41] name any sin
[48:42] it's already conquered well come on
[48:44] somebody
[48:45] name any problem you're going through
[48:47] tonight it's already conquered
[48:51] he's already done it and that's all that
[48:53] matters
[48:58] but abraham so you're going to have a
[49:02] baby
[49:04] he'd get up and say how you feeling
[49:06] sarah
[49:09] this is no different well glory to god
[49:11] we're going to have it anyhow
[49:14] go get the bird eye and the pens and the
[49:15] baby bed and everything get it ready
[49:17] another month pass how you feeling no
[49:19] different well
[49:21] sarah what about it no different 10

[49:59] miraculous there's more that say an egg
[50:01] when god

[52:08] [Applause]
[52:17] he says when jesus would walk to the
[52:20] life of a tree
[52:22] so there's a formula of that tree that
[52:24] has a life
[52:25] and he said curse it be you you don't
[52:27] have any fruit you'll never have any
[52:28] from this time

[52:58] to rebuke whatever
[53:00] kind of sin or sickness that is here
[53:02] today and it'll die from the roots

[53:11] he said
[53:12] cancer tumor cataracts everything else

[53:15] when christ speaks why he cast out
[53:19] devils and he said in my name you
[53:22] shall cast out devils speak with new
[53:24] tongue take up serpent or deadly things
[53:26] it will not harm me if they lay their
[53:28] hands on the sick they shall recover

[54:26] on the sea of galilee one night and that
[54:29] boat was being tossed
[54:31] tossed around and he acted like he
[54:33] didn't even pay it any attention
[54:36] how would the devil feel if we done him
[54:38] that way
[54:40] we don't even pay him no attention
[54:41] because he don't matter
[54:46] he was tired he needed some sleep and he
[54:49] didn't care what the devil was going to
[54:50] do he's going to get sleep
[54:53] he wasn't paying him no attention he
[54:55] said
[54:56] he he said something had to happen had
[54:59] happened he said it was at a junction
[55:01] he said he put his foot on the braille
[55:03] the bow of the boat and looked up and
[55:05] said peace
[55:06] be still and i tell you the very creator
[55:09] of heaven
[55:10] and earth laid in a boat but nature
[55:13] still
[55:14] had to obey him when omnipotence speak
[55:17] the miraculous takes place
[55:22] hallelujah when omnipotence speak that
[55:25] means having unlimited
[55:28] power when it speaks the miraculous
[55:31] takes place
[55:32] a leper full of leprosy but it didn't
[55:34] matter went one day to a lord who did
[55:37] matter
[55:38] and he said lord can if thou will can
[55:40] you make me clean he said i will
[55:42] be thou clean what happened it was the
[55:44] omnipotent speaking
[55:46] and the miraculous took place and the
[55:48] leprosy
[55:49] vanished like a sun flying behind a
[55:51] cloud somewhere
[55:54] hallelujah when the voice of omnipotence
[55:57] speaks
[55:57] and he's here to speak again in this
[56:00] last day
[56:04] and when he speaks nothing else matters
[56:08] amen just like a lion when he would roar
[56:10] in a jungle
[56:12] everything else just shuts up because
[56:14] he's the king
[56:17] he matters when omnipotence comes out
[56:21] and you may be going through the world's
[56:23] roughest day of your life and your
[56:24] boat's been rocking back and forth
[56:26] but all of a sudden tonight jesus
[56:30] steps to the plate and he steps on the
[56:32] bow of your boat
[56:34] and he says peace
[56:40] demons could be in the middle of a
[56:41] sentence they go ah
[56:44] they can be in the middle of trying to
[56:46] strike you down and they got to stop
[56:49] because he matters and they know he
[56:52] matters
[56:55] do you understand the devil knows your
[56:57] god
[56:58] the devil knows exactly the power he has
[57:01] he knows exactly the abilities he has
[57:04] he knows when jesus comes on the scene
[57:06] his time is finished
[57:07] it's over with he don't have nothing
[57:09] else to say he don't have any more power
[57:12] he's lost it it's done it's finished
[57:15] when jesus comes on the scene cancer has
[57:17] to stop
[57:18] when jesus comes on the same blame
[57:20] breeze have to stop
[57:21] when he comes on the scene depression
[57:23] has to flee when he comes on the scene
[57:26] every kind of spirit of hell has to shut
[57:28] its mouth
[57:30] when he comes that's why the most
[57:31] important person you can meet with
[57:33] tonight
[57:34] is jesus
[57:40] when omnipotence speaks the miraculous
[57:43] happens
[57:44] he healed the sick he raised the dead he
[57:47] opened the eyes of the blind proving
[57:49] to the people i have the power to lay my
[57:51] life down i have the power to take it
[57:53] back up
[57:54] and no man can take it away from me
[58:04] amen he says brother
[58:08] as a gospel preacher this morning i
[58:10] believe that the holy ghost speaking
[58:12] through mortal lips today
[58:14] anointed ministers are speaking anointed
[58:17] ministers are speaking
[58:19] the time has come and the time
[58:23] is here omnipotence has answered
[58:26] and the miraculous is taking place
[58:30] hello did you hear that i believe god
[58:32] has anointed ministry on this day
[58:34] that says the time has come
[58:39] amen when you go out to battle you're
[58:41] going to need a miracle
[58:42] because you're powerless on your own how
[58:44] many times you have to show the children
[58:46] of israel you can't do it on your own
[58:48] and without me you're nothing
[58:52] they would go out and serve other gods
[58:54] and the next thing you know the enemy
[58:55] could take them like they were
[58:56] just water through a drain nothing
[59:02] but then he would come back on the scene
[59:04] and anoint a little man and kill
[59:05] 500 kill 600 kill a thousand whatever it
[59:08] took kill
[59:09] uh 200 000 with just music being played
[59:13] thousands on top of that what was it god
[59:15] showed them time after time
[59:17] i am all that matters
[59:21] and this world has forgotten that this
[59:23] nation has forgotten that
[59:26] this nation one time believed god
[59:28] mattered mattered so much they'd put it
[59:30] on their
[59:30] coins they would put it on their money
[59:32] they would put it over on their creeds
[59:34] and the things and the
[59:35] papers that wrote this nation and built
[59:37] this nation but today
[59:38] they they it don't matter no more
[59:42] god does not matter
[59:45] you don't matter enough to have them in
[59:46] their schools he don't have
[59:48] he don't matter enough to have them in
[59:50] their everyday lives he don't matter
[59:52] enough to have them in their job
[59:53] he don't matter enough to have them at
[59:55] sports events he don't matter at all to
[59:57] them
[59:59] and they're going to learn very quickly
[1:00:00] when you take god out and he don't
[1:00:02] matter
[1:00:03] then you don't matter
[1:00:10] it's the truth
[1:00:14] when he done all the miraculous the
[1:00:16] omnipotence was speaking god manifested
[1:00:19] in flesh
[1:00:20] he would come this the roman centurion
[1:00:22] would come and said speak the word lord
[1:00:24] and my servant will be healed my servant
[1:00:27] will live
[1:00:29] he knew whatever whatever he said
[1:00:32] they had to do it because he was a man
[1:00:35] of authority
[1:00:36] so i say to this command come he said
[1:00:38] i'm a man of authority i say this man
[1:00:40] come
[1:00:41] and he comes this man goes and he goes
[1:00:43] i'm a man of authority and everything
[1:00:44] under my authority obeys me
[1:00:46] and lord i'm not worthy that you'd come
[1:00:48] into my house so just speak the word
[1:00:51] i mean he knew that was omnipotence and
[1:00:53] he knew
[1:00:54] when omnipotence spoke the miraculous
[1:00:57] would take place
[1:00:58] it did at the grave of lazarus martha
[1:01:01] said lord if he had been here for my
[1:01:02] brother would not have died but even now
[1:01:05] omnipotence speaks whatever you ask god
[1:01:07] god will do it whatever you say
[1:01:10] he will do he walked to the grave
[1:01:14] omnipotence manifested here among us
[1:01:16] living with us
[1:01:18] god in christ reconciling the world to
[1:01:20] himself here he lived with us
[1:01:22] god proven his son christ jesus
[1:01:25] omnipotent
[1:01:26] and miraculous and if he's the same
[1:01:28] yesterday today and forever
[1:01:30] he said i'll never leave you i'll never
[1:01:32] forsake you
[1:01:33] i'll be with you to the end of the world
[1:01:35] how can we look for anything else
[1:01:38] but when he speaks that the miraculous
[1:01:40] will
[1:01:41] happen it's got to happen
[1:01:46] the miraculous will take place
[1:01:57] let me go on down here
[1:02:02] but god testing the patriarch
[1:02:06] abraham and every one of us is going to
[1:02:10] have tests
[1:02:12] every one of us is going to have trials
[1:02:15] god had given a promise
[1:02:18] when he gives a man a promise he wants
[1:02:21] to make sure this person is worthy
[1:02:23] of the promise i ask you tonight are you
[1:02:26] worthy of the promise
[1:02:31] before he fulfills what he said or what
[1:02:33] he promised and abraham had been
[1:02:35] promised
[1:02:36] that his seed the whole through his seed
[1:02:38] the whole world would be blessed and
[1:02:39] he'd have a son
[1:02:41] and out of him would come forth a seed
[1:02:43] that would bless the whole earth
[1:02:44] abraham when the promise was given him
[1:02:46] maybe 75
[1:02:48] or so years old sarah 65 but the bible
[1:02:51] tells us
[1:02:52] that abraham staggered not at the
[1:02:54] promises of god through unbelief
[1:02:56] but was strong in the faith praising god
[1:02:59] glorifying god
[1:03:01] giving god to praise year after year
[1:03:04] after year after year
[1:03:07] god time after time after time year
[1:03:09] after year
[1:03:10] testing him until he come to the final
[1:03:12] test before his blessing was going to
[1:03:14] happen
[1:03:15] and that's the way it is with all the
[1:03:16] seed of abraham god gives us the final
[1:03:19] test
[1:03:19] before he gives us the blessing and if
[1:03:21] this possible i'd like to say it here
[1:03:23] now
[1:03:23] the final test is how you react and when
[1:03:26] he gave abraham his test he found
[1:03:29] just how true he was what a blessing it
[1:03:32] would be this morning
[1:03:33] if we who take his promise of healing
[1:03:35] would just stand just as true
[1:03:37] as we could no matter what the doctor
[1:03:40] said
[1:03:41] just stand true just stand there because
[1:03:45] his word
[1:03:46] has promised healing to us
[1:03:49] it's promised deliverance to us it's
[1:03:51] promised healing
[1:03:53] salvation to us just stand there
[1:04:02] and here he come to this test to take
[1:04:05] his son's life
[1:04:08] he had testified all over the earth he
[1:04:10] acquainted with he was going to have a
[1:04:11] son
[1:04:13] now he's going to come back and destroy
[1:04:14] him
[1:04:16] destroy the only hope he had for a
[1:04:18] testimony to be fulfilled
[1:04:21] god seen her loyal heart pulled back
[1:04:25] he looked out of heaven and said i've
[1:04:26] sworn by myself i'll bless you
[1:04:28] and multiply you and your seed shall
[1:04:32] possess the gate of the enemy
[1:04:34] what a promise
[1:04:38] what a promise how many is here
[1:04:40] abraham's seed
[1:04:43] then you're to possess the gate of the
[1:04:44] enemy
[1:04:46] and when you draw an eye to the enemy
[1:04:48] and you see he's greater in number
[1:04:50] and he has more horses than you he has
[1:04:52] more chariots in you he has more ability
[1:04:55] to you
[1:04:55] than you fear not
[1:05:01] because there happens to be a god that
[1:05:04] when you're pulling that knife back
[1:05:08] he can create something out of nothing
[1:05:12] abraham there in his moment of trial
[1:05:15] just about to do what god said to do he
[1:05:17] said abraham
[1:05:20] hold it stop i provided the lamb
[1:05:28] i gave you what you have need of
[1:05:31] i've done this for you i have the
[1:05:34] ability
[1:05:35] i am able to provide when no one else
[1:05:37] can provide
[1:05:39] i'm able to give when no one else can
[1:05:41] give
[1:05:42] i'm able to bless when no one else can
[1:05:44] bless i'm able to give you what you have
[1:05:47] need of
[1:05:48] it because you trusted me
[1:05:53] and i'm the only thing that matters
[1:06:07] he would he would move on
[1:06:11] god's sworn promise the seed would
[1:06:14] possess the gates of its enemy
[1:06:16] so that god would give that kind of
[1:06:18] promise to you tonight
[1:06:20] he's got to make a way for you to
[1:06:21] possess it
[1:06:24] because we can see through the bible
[1:06:25] human abilities
[1:06:27] is not able to even possess a regular
[1:06:29] old city
[1:06:30] just natural enemies it's impossible so
[1:06:33] if naturally you couldn't
[1:06:34] produce it or possess it naturally how
[1:06:37] can naturally possess spiritually
[1:06:39] you get what i'm saying you can't do it
[1:06:41] it's impossible
[1:06:42] so he has to make a way if he said thy
[1:06:44] seed shall possess the gate
[1:06:46] of the enemy that's his promise then he
[1:06:48] has to make the way to possess it
[1:06:52] so he has to give the power to possess
[1:06:54] it he has to give the ability to possess
[1:06:57] it
[1:06:57] he has to give something inside of you
[1:07:00] that no matter what if all hell comes
[1:07:02] against you you can stand
[1:07:03] no matter what comes again that you're
[1:07:05] going to possess the gate of the enemy
[1:07:08] that the gate that means the hell is
[1:07:10] going to be against you
[1:07:11] this is the pr this is in the promise
[1:07:13] hell's going to be against you
[1:07:15] but you're going to possess it you're
[1:07:17] going to take it over you're going to
[1:07:18] destroy it
[1:07:19] it's going to be your possession in
[1:07:22] other words it's going to be under you
[1:07:24] so to give that promise he's telling you
[1:07:27] it's going to come
[1:07:28] against you but there's going to be a
[1:07:29] power there to resist that thing
[1:07:31] and destroy that thing and conquer that
[1:07:34] thing and put it under your feet
[1:07:38] and i understand we all all of us have
[1:07:41] tried on our own to possess the gates of
[1:07:43] the
[1:07:44] gates of hell we've all tried to possess
[1:07:46] and take over pornography on our own
[1:07:48] we've all tried to take over
[1:07:50] spirits and things all these kind of
[1:07:52] things on our own women has other
[1:07:54] problems whatever
[1:07:55] things that you tried to do on your own
[1:07:57] year after year failure after failure
[1:07:59] and you realize i can't do it i can't
[1:08:02] live it
[1:08:03] it's not in my abilities it's impossible
[1:08:08] but then he gives you something possible
[1:08:12] it's the holy spirit it's the holy
[1:08:15] spirit working
[1:08:16] in you it's the holy spirit that comes
[1:08:19] inside of you that's why it's important
[1:08:21] that's what matters in this hours to
[1:08:22] receive the holy ghost
[1:08:25] amen what don't don't matter in this
[1:08:27] hour is to go to a certain church
[1:08:29] or to be a member of a certain church i
[1:08:31] had somebody today or
[1:08:33] this week that you know say i want to
[1:08:34] come in and be a member at your church
[1:08:36] that's not what's in my that's not what
[1:08:38] matters
[1:08:39] what matters is you get the holy ghost
[1:08:45] amen that's what that's what matters
[1:08:49] but the world to the world it don't
[1:08:50] matter the world the world wants to tell
[1:08:52] you well you can be a christian and you
[1:08:54] want to live this way
[1:08:55] you know nobody can be a real christian
[1:08:57] nobody can live that kind of life we
[1:08:59] we're all have sinned and fallen short
[1:09:01] of the glory of god
[1:09:02] and they try to make it where it don't
[1:09:03] matter the word don't matter what he
[1:09:06] said in his word don't matter
[1:09:07] what he what what he said about hair or
[1:09:09] dress or
[1:09:10] or your body is a temple it don't matter
[1:09:13] and it does matter it's the most
[1:09:16] important thing in this world
[1:09:19] but you can't do it or possess it on
[1:09:21] your own it's impossible
[1:09:23] you got to get what matters and one of
[1:09:26] the most important things in our life
[1:09:28] is receiving the holy ghost
[1:09:33] the seal of god to come into our lives
[1:09:36] and you get that seal then you'll have
[1:09:38] to worry about joining the church
[1:09:43] he said when you get the holy ghost
[1:09:44] you'll be there when the doors are open
[1:09:48] hello somebody

[1:10:16] take care of that
[1:10:18] i'll get you the quote if you want it
[1:10:20] that's what matters
[1:10:22] hello somebody that's what matters the
[1:10:25] holy ghost
[1:10:27] but i know people don't need a popular
[1:10:29] message no more it's more popular to
[1:10:31] preach popular things
[1:10:33] that you can live a certain life be a
[1:10:34] certain way and you're going to grow
[1:10:35] into token life you're going to grow
[1:10:37] there one day one day one day
[1:10:38] and it's always a carrot out there but
[1:10:40] how you get it is repent
[1:10:43] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:10:45] christ and say god
[1:10:47] i want you more than anything because
[1:10:50] you
[1:10:50] are all that matters he
[1:10:53] matters more than any job he matters
[1:10:56] more than any money in any account
[1:10:58] he matters more than anything
[1:11:03] this is what he said we told the story
[1:11:06] of the little flower
[1:11:09] man who found the magic flower
[1:11:13] heard the story said he was
[1:11:16] found his magic flower and he would
[1:11:18] flower and he would open up the riches
[1:11:20] whatever
[1:11:21] give him a wish as to be opened up the
[1:11:23] riches of the earth
[1:11:27] and he opened him up it was all kind of
[1:11:29] diamonds and
[1:11:31] trinkets and just unbelievable riches
[1:11:35] the man gets so enthralled and lays a
[1:11:38] little flower down
[1:11:40] it's like oh man look at all this
[1:11:44] i finally can pay off my house i i
[1:11:46] finally can have a little money i
[1:11:48] i finally can get somewhere in the world
[1:11:50] i i can have this and maybe buy myself a
[1:11:52] kingdom or
[1:11:53] or buy some i i'm rich
[1:11:56] and he grabbed something that he found
[1:11:58] that seemed to be important
[1:12:00] what mattered to him maybe it was a gold
[1:12:01] big old giant piece of gold
[1:12:03] and run to run out of the cave with it
[1:12:05] and he hears a voice
[1:12:06] don't forget the main thing
[1:12:12] and i'm afraid that's what we're doing
[1:12:14] in our lives in our churches
[1:12:16] we're forgetting the main thing we've
[1:12:19] got a theology got a crew got a dogma
[1:12:22] got our ways of living our what rights
[1:12:23] and our wrongs but what about the main
[1:12:25] thing
[1:12:27] what about the spirit of god moving in
[1:12:29] our churches what about the miraculous
[1:12:31] taking place
[1:12:32] what about signs and wonders being
[1:12:34] performed it's all in the word
[1:12:37] and if he's here then these things are
[1:12:39] happening
[1:12:40] they're taking place they're moving in
[1:12:42] the body and he throws that thing back
[1:12:44] in there and said well what can be more
[1:12:45] important than that and he found
[1:12:46] something else
[1:12:47] he thought was of greater value and he
[1:12:49] runs out and hears the voice saying
[1:12:50] don't forget the main thing what in the
[1:12:54] world can be the main thing
[1:12:55] and what's what's more important what
[1:12:57] this can buy me all kinds of stuff
[1:12:59] and he throws it back in there and it
[1:13:00] gets him a second job third job or
[1:13:02] whatever and he finds him a better job
[1:13:04] they keep him out of the house of the
[1:13:05] lord
[1:13:07] and he finds him something amen he pulls
[1:13:09] it out and he starts running with it and
[1:13:11] hears the voice
[1:13:11] don't forget the main thing and just
[1:13:15] forgot forget about it i don't know
[1:13:17] what's so important
[1:13:18] just let he throws it and he walks out
[1:13:20] and the cave closed behind him with the
[1:13:22] flower on the inside

[1:17:25] believe the true seed of abraham will
[1:17:28] fail they'll
[1:17:30] stand just as gallant and loyal as
[1:17:32] abraham ever did
[1:17:35] hallelujah we see that god cannot say
[1:17:37] anything or make any promise unless he
[1:17:39] fulfills it
[1:17:40] he has to in order to be god years later
[1:17:43] when the same
[1:17:44] people the promised people of abraham

[1:18:38] kind of breath is blowing and hell is
[1:18:40] blowing
[1:18:40] and saying you're not essential and
[1:18:42] saying you're not there and saying

[1:19:43] the fire and the
[1:19:44] storms and the rain and the hell and the
[1:19:47] red sea
[1:19:48] and all that hemmed in by pharaoh's army
[1:19:51] mountains and deserts
[1:19:52] moses stepped forward and possessed the
[1:19:54] gate across the red sea
[1:19:56] walking on a dusty road god said so and
[1:19:59] that settled it
[1:20:00] but a little was little year a few years
[1:20:02] later when trials come
[1:20:06] and the church got all shook up as it's
[1:20:09] so easy for a congregation of people to
[1:20:11] do
[1:20:12] when something isn't happening just the
[1:20:14] way it's supposed to be
[1:20:18] i don't think this year went exactly how
[1:20:20] we thought it was supposed to be
[1:20:22] and people have gotten shook up
[1:20:26] he said it's so easy to do when things
[1:20:29] don't happen the way it's supposed to be
[1:20:32] supposed to have graduation parties
[1:20:34] we're supposed to have birthday parties
[1:20:36] we're supposed to be able to meet
[1:20:37] together we're suppo and it don't happen
[1:20:39] that way
[1:20:41] he said god makes it that way
[1:20:45] the devil can't do nothing unless god
[1:20:47] gives him permission don't ever forget
[1:20:48] that
[1:20:50] covet could not be here unless god just
[1:20:52] said okay it's time for it
[1:20:55] world war world wars couldn't happen
[1:20:57] unless god said it's time for it
[1:21:00] spirits cannot have their way unless god
[1:21:02] says it's time for it
[1:21:04] because he's all that matters amen
[1:21:08] god brings tensions into the church
[1:21:18] i don't know about that brother timothy
[1:21:20] for every son that cometh to god must be
[1:21:22] tried
[1:21:23] proven and tested he let sickness strike
[1:21:26] you
[1:21:29] i thought this was rejoicing he lets
[1:21:33] disease come on you
[1:21:36] to test you and to prove you and show
[1:21:39] the world
[1:21:41] you are truly the seed of abraham
[1:21:46] the devil's only here to show the world
[1:21:49] who you are that's his whole purpose
[1:21:53] that's his whole purpose of being here
[1:21:55] is to show the world
[1:21:56] who timothy pruitt is who you are
[1:21:59] [Applause]
[1:22:03] he permits it by his own will he permits
[1:22:06] disasters
[1:22:07] he permits the friends to turn against
[1:22:09] you he permits all these things
[1:22:11] and he turns the devil loose to tempt
[1:22:13] you he'll do all but take your life
[1:22:15] he'll throw you in a bed of affliction
[1:22:17] he'll turn your neighbors against you
[1:22:18] he'll turn the church against you he can
[1:22:20] do almost anything if it's god's will
[1:22:23] for him to do it
[1:22:24] we're taught though that it's more
[1:22:26] precious than gold to us
[1:22:30] oh man
[1:22:33] that's kind of one of them quotes he put
[1:22:35] over there somewhere
[1:22:38] but it's the truth things come and it
[1:22:41] ain't always how we plan for it to be
[1:22:43] or we dreamed of it to be or how we
[1:22:45] wanted to be
[1:22:46] but he's what matters he's got a plan
[1:22:51] he's got a way to get a bride to a
[1:22:52] certain place
[1:22:54] he's got a way of of moving things and
[1:22:56] orchestrating
[1:22:57] things i mean you can see it god's hand
[1:22:59] and in battles through
[1:23:01] natural battles all the way down through
[1:23:03] our our history of our even our own
[1:23:05] uh a nation you can see god's hand
[1:23:07] moving
[1:23:08] in every situation and i know people
[1:23:11] want to say well that's just
[1:23:11] happenstance no
[1:23:12] god's planning something hallelujah
[1:23:18] he said here you come with abraham he
[1:23:20] allowed him to get to a spot
[1:23:23] he let abraham be tested to that final
[1:23:26] point
[1:23:27] he got to test you and me to that final
[1:23:30] point
[1:23:31] that time of decision when everything's
[1:23:33] away from you and you have to stand
[1:23:35] alone
[1:23:38] stand alone that don't sound fun hello

[1:24:30] him that's the seed of abraham
[1:24:33] that's the one who gives the promise no
[1:24:34] matter what the rest of themself
[1:24:37] the rest of them says or the rest of
[1:24:39] them do for me and my house
[1:24:41] we're going to serve the lord if the
[1:24:43] rest of them says there's nothing to
[1:24:44] experience and there's a bunch of
[1:24:46] excitement
[1:24:46] for me and my house we're going to serve
[1:24:48] the lord i'd like to take it up with
[1:24:50] paul here
[1:24:51] and say the way they call heresy so i
[1:24:53] worship the god of our fathers
[1:24:55] though they be tattlers and churches
[1:24:57] through there'll be twisters and they'll
[1:24:58] be
[1:24:58] all kinds of false prophets and
[1:25:00] everything comes out amongst the people
[1:25:02] and the neighborhood and everything but
[1:25:03] for me and my house we're going to serve
[1:25:05] them all
[1:25:06] the lord though all of them quit coming
[1:25:08] though the church gets cold and
[1:25:10] different in my house but as for me and

[1:25:19] and my house
[1:25:20] we're going to serve the lord
[1:25:23] nothing else matters
[1:25:29] testing and trials
[1:25:36] men are not fallible or men are not
[1:25:40] infallible but god is
[1:25:42] men make mistakes of course you get your
[1:25:45] mind on a man he'll make a mistake
[1:25:48] he'll do it god permits him to do it
[1:25:51] so he can shake your faith away from
[1:25:52] that man our faith is not in the wisdom
[1:25:55] of men
[1:25:56] it's in the power of the resurrection of
[1:25:58] jesus christ
[1:26:01] that's where the true seed of abraham
[1:26:02] rests their promise
[1:26:04] because they can only be the seed of
[1:26:06] abraham when they receive the holy
[1:26:09] spirit
[1:26:11] hello somebody this or what have caused
[1:26:13] you to rise up in the middle of your
[1:26:15] chaos and say though god slayed me
[1:26:17] i'm going to trust him why because
[1:26:19] there's something else there's a greater
[1:26:21] power inside
[1:26:22] of you that when the flesh is willing or
[1:26:24] the flesh is weak the spirit is willing
[1:26:27] and able to stand up and say no devil
[1:26:30] i'm not bowing i'm not going that
[1:26:34] direction
[1:26:38] you know it didn't matter to joshua and
[1:26:41] caleb
[1:26:42] when they came to that land had been
[1:26:44] talked about promised to him
[1:26:46] been painted such a beautiful picture
[1:26:50] and did you notice how god does things
[1:26:53] i've said it before but he he tells them
[1:26:56] he's going to take them out he's going
[1:26:57] to take them in
[1:26:58] and he tells them nothing about what's
[1:27:00] in between
[1:27:02] because it didn't matter
[1:27:05] all that matters was him because i'm
[1:27:08] taking you out
[1:27:09] and i'm taking you in so the red sea
[1:27:12] didn't matter no water mattered
[1:27:15] no food didn't it didn't matter nothing
[1:27:17] like that mattered all that mattered was
[1:27:19] god said i'm taking you out
[1:27:21] i'm taking you in and he tells him i'm
[1:27:24] gonna take you to a land
[1:27:25] flowing with milk and honey did you
[1:27:28] notice there wasn't no mention of the
[1:27:30] jericho and the walls and the hittites
[1:27:33] and the
[1:27:34] jebusites and and the amorites and and
[1:27:37] the mighty armies and the chariots
[1:27:39] there was no mention he said i'm going
[1:27:40] to take you to a land flowing with milk
[1:27:43] and honey
[1:27:47] because none of that mattered to god
[1:27:49] jericho didn't matter
[1:27:52] they had great walls didn't matter had
[1:27:54] great chariots didn't matter
[1:27:56] god was going to tear it down
[1:28:01] god would deliver them from every enemy
[1:28:03] they would face if they would serve him
[1:28:05] that's all that mattered you serve me
[1:28:08] and any of these none of these enemies
[1:28:09] matter but if you don't serve me
[1:28:12] then these enemies will have you and
[1:28:14] they'll take your daughters and they'll
[1:28:16] take your sons and they'll slay
[1:28:17] you can read about it through the bible
[1:28:19] and so but when they go over to the
[1:28:20] spies and spies with the spire of the
[1:28:22] land
[1:28:23] all of a sudden man there's giants here
[1:28:28] there's walls this ain't possible
[1:28:32] it's it's impossible
[1:28:35] joshua and caleb it didn't matter they
[1:28:38] didn't come back talking about walls and
[1:28:40] chariots and
[1:28:41] no it's all come talking about the land
[1:28:43] god promised and we're more than able to
[1:28:45] take it
[1:28:46] this is our land god said so that's all
[1:28:48] that mattered
[1:28:51] i can i can just see as we look at this
[1:28:53] joshua and caleb didn't go over there to
[1:28:55] see how big the giants was they went
[1:28:56] over there to see where their house was
[1:28:57] going to be
[1:29:00] they went over to see where where's my
[1:29:01] land at caleb picked it out
[1:29:04] he said i want that mountain right there
[1:29:05] joshua when we come in here i want that
[1:29:08] and the mother spies no doubt said caleb
[1:29:10] have you not seen the giants on that
[1:29:11] mountain don't matter
[1:29:14] have you not seen all the armies and the
[1:29:16] cities on that mount don't matter god
[1:29:18] said i had it in his mind and he gave it
[1:29:20] to me that's all that matters
[1:29:22] listen if you'll start looking at your
[1:29:24] enemy once again that it don't matter
[1:29:27] whatever he has whatever sickness
[1:29:29] whatever problems whatever situation
[1:29:31] god said it's your healing god said it's
[1:29:35] your joy
[1:29:36] god said it's your deliverance god said
[1:29:38] it's yours
[1:29:40] that's all that matters because he
[1:29:43] matters more than your enemy does
[1:29:51] he said i can see joshua
[1:29:56] jump up on some kind of box and said to
[1:29:58] about 2 million people
[1:29:59] screaming out men and brethren we're
[1:30:02] more than able to take it
[1:30:05] he said what was it there was a seat of
[1:30:08] abraham
[1:30:09] god gave the promise it was their
[1:30:11] possession it didn't matter what the
[1:30:13] opposition was
[1:30:15] because the opposition don't matter
[1:30:18] hallelujah the true seed of abraham said
[1:30:21] we
[1:30:21] can take it because god gave it to you
[1:30:24] and he said there you stand this morning
[1:30:27] what are you going to say
[1:30:32] hello somebody every one of you is
[1:30:35] looking at an enemy right now what are
[1:30:37] you going to say to him
[1:30:42] hallelujah he said what will you stay
[1:30:46] when here stands the church of the
[1:30:48] living god
[1:30:49] he said i don't care what anybody says
[1:30:51] what the doctor says
[1:30:53] what the unbeliever says we are more
[1:30:56] than a match
[1:30:57] for anything that comes along

[1:31:19] the church of the living god is more
[1:31:21] than a match why
[1:31:22] we're abraham's seed and we're
[1:31:24] possessing the gates of our enemy
[1:31:26] no matter what the enemy is god gave the
[1:31:29] promise
[1:31:30] and that's all that matters it's yours

[1:31:54] the seed of abraham it is so
[1:31:57] it is so why god said they would have it
[1:32:00] and that's the reason why we believe it
[1:32:02] because god said we can have it
[1:32:05] if god said i can have my healing that's
[1:32:07] all that matters
[1:32:08] if god said i can have my joy tonight
[1:32:11] that's all that
