========================================

hello everyone we are the ministry team and even in like tabernacle in Minden Louisiana and we're just happy that you joined with us again today for another discussion on the Word of God in past sessions we have talked about what defines the church in our last session we were dealing with the judgment that fell upon the Jewish people for the rejection of the Messiah and missing their day of visitation and I wanted to make it clear that we do not believe that the Jewish people are Christ killers in fact the Romans and Gentiles had as much to do with crucifying crises what the Jews did and so but it was that Jesus willingly and purposely died for the sins of the world specifically and personally for our sins and to do this he would come in such a way that would blind the eyes of his own people for the sake of salvation in order to become the slain lamb on the behalf of sin the scripture says it this way Paul in first corinthians says which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory so we believe the Jews are God's people but because of how he came as a suffering Prince instead of a reigning king that they had hoped for in that hour a very gross terrible darkness they mistakenly crucified their Messiah yes sir and so this is an exact parallel to what happened with Joseph and his brethren Joseph was loved of his father hated and betrayed by his brother and sold for silver down into Egypt and on the way to the throne he strode into prison from their exalted to the right hand of Pharaoh and yet he says but don't be angry at yourselves this was done to preserve life so you know again we realized that even the rejection of Christ was so that the Gentiles could come in and so that they could God would call out of them a people so why is it that the people of God except for like few were swept away into two thousand years of great tribulation and persecution upon the people is there a repeat of this do you think you know a lot of a lot of people question why you know Christ died 2,000 years ago why are we still here what's happened has he just forgotten about us sir and what many doesn't realize is the Holy Spirit indicated as Jesus said when he the Spirit of Truth has come he'll lead you and guide you into all truth and show you things to come that there was more truth going to come and we find even in the Book of Revelations that had opened up the plan of redemption God's future work to the Gentile people and so what's obscure to many is actually very detailed in the prophetic book of the book of Revelation so while the Jews were scattered throughout the known world for two thousand years God was now going to bring a gospel to the Gentile people for the first time around the world and it's an incredible prophecies that are attached to this but God the Bible said has God you know forsaken his people or as you know as this done the Bible says God forbid yeah but God will bring Israel back to a restoration he's not done with her he's just injected the work of grace to the Gentile people and he will return it's very important to remember that they're blinding was for our sake amen the reason that they went through that is so that we could have an opportunity at the gospel mm-hmm you know but even you talked about them being swept away and in the siege of Titus those things weren't done without warning without opportunity to repent you know there was there was warning in the scripture that told them when you see these things come into pass if you're on the rooftop you know come don't come back down and pray that you don't have to flee in the winter on the Sabbath day and we're in a time where there's been warnings given to the to the Gentiles yes you know it's not that God's going to come back and strike judgment and people are going to be able to say well you didn't give us opportunity there's there's plenty of warning and plenty of opportunity once again yeah also it's it's amazing to me that how how they were blinded when Jesus came and done undeniable things that you could not attribute to a man you couldn't attribute to any no man could do what he'd done in miracles and signs you know like the blind man that was healed he created highballs you know and it was questioning him about it he said well this is a marvelous thing never since before the world was formed there's a man been given his sight and getting get been given eyes hey yeah you don't know who he is yeah but then you flip-flop it and now here we're coming backwards changing back over and there's also another blinding that's taking place and people are not realizing when they see the same signs of the Messiah and they're calling it a devil or they're calling it you know the curse of thing and it's really God a gay man they M eyes and cannot see and ears and cannot hear yeah well it just shows that we're here in that last age of Laodicea where that they're blinded wretched miserable poor and don't know it and it's a horrible condition because it was in a condition just like that that Israel would reject their Messiah so you will find that among the Gentiles the Bible prophesies a time that Christ will be put outside his own church he's standing on the outside door knocking and so there is another rejection of Christ going on this time by the Gentile people incredible but yet in the midst of that there's an Alexei just as it was with the Jews hey man we've in the day of Titus and I know we spoke of it last time you know the Christians weren't called inside the city your day they had they heated the warming you know and we're talking about the rejection that's going on the sad thing is that a lot of the rejection is actually amongst people who claim to be worshipers a lot of the rejection is amongst people who claim even Christianity and you go back to Titus and Josephus says that 1.1 million died in Jerusalem which was actually a much larger number than the national population of Jerusalem and the reason it was so many is that worshippers who had not heeded what Jesus said came to the city edible to worship for the Passover and got trapped inside the city but here they are denying the warning that they had been given but they were worshippers yeah and that's what calls the great slaughter so we're seeing a real phenomenon our date because actually Israel is once against the nation that the Jewish people are back in their homeland and so it's a phenomenal that hasn't been seen in these past 2,000 years showing that we are at the setting of the closing of the Gentiles dispensation because Israel is now gathered back and getting ready for to receive their Messiah yes so what kind of people are we to be in this island man jesus said when you see the fig tree put forth its figs you know summer is nigh likewise when you see these prophecies take place look up for your Redemption draweth nigh yeah and it's indicated that the Israel becoming a nation after 2,000 years it is indicating the coming of the Lord you know I would like to just share that scriptures Matthew 24 33 so likewise when you see all these things know that it is near even at the door very I saying to you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled and many people who get that said well there's 40 years of generation and all 19 or was it 1948 may the 14th that Israel becomes a nation and so now you know it looks like things just are continuing on as they always was and maybe we're just getting alarmed about nothing but I want you to remember and look at it this way it's not when the United Nation recognizes them or not when even when they form a government but when God recognizes Israel as a nation is when God reveals himself to them as a messiah it'll be that generation that will not pass away till all things be fulfilled so you know we're in a great power and a great time you know right on the cusp of hundreds of scriptures being focusing yes sir so Titus coming in and ringing down the curtain on the Jewish dispensation as it's moving now to the Gentiles Paul comes right in behind opens the door faith to the Gentiles in several places in the book of Acts Paul said lo we turned to the Gentiles and God begins a work among the Gentile people bringing the gospel for the first time an opportunity to know God and to know salvation and what a glorious thing Titus was a type of the endtime tribulation period as he brought the judgment on the end of the Jewish nation there will be a judgment on the end of the Gentile dispensation mm-hmm and this is called the Great Tribulation Period and a lot of people understand it is the Great Tribulation Period but we understand it that there's to be a rapture that goes before that time yeah and there's some that have the conception that at the rapture planes will fall out of the sky and cars will be left abandon it stoplights and it'll be mass chaos and people will be screaming and realized dear God we miss the rapture we miss the rapture but according to the scriptures that really won't be the picture and the reason that that won't be the picture one is because Jesus said he'll come as a thief in the night yes and that it'll almost be unrecognized and unknown right number two it's not all the church as we would call it church that goes in the wrath but there's actually more to it in the rapture of there's one group that does go in the rapture that's called the church and there's another group that's called the church that goes through the tribulation period so Eisley in the end time there's really two comings of the Lord if we would take it you know his comings as always in threes he came first to redeem his his bride his church and then he comes back for his church and then he comes back with his church so not with Israel one thing that made the real blinding of Israel was as they were they were looking for the wrong coming yeah okay so they were looking for him to come as king but they did not understand he had to fulfill Isaiah 53 and come as a suffering Prince to become wounded for our transgressions and pay the penalty of sin and he had to do that first before the kingdom would be restored to Israel and and the great kingdom of ahead I had so you know they were looking for the wrong coming and even there they wanted to make Christ the King as you remember there was several incidences where they tried to take him by force and make him a king named one of the Messiah drive the Romans back and let the Israel be the predominant nation in the world and all of the dreams that the Jewish people had because they were looking for the wrong coming yes and I think today that people are looking for the wrong coming they're confusing the two of worries coming where he's coming back for his bride and the one where he comes back with yes the Saints to take over the earth and so it all happens here in this time period but but there is one where ever I will see him and every tongue will confess and that's when he comes back with his Saints yes and history fulfilled Zacharias prophecies in Zechariah 12 and 14 which which shows him that the Lord that God will come in all his saints with him this fulfills revelation one in seven that ever I shall see him and they that pierced him which is the Jews will see him and so this is when he will come back with the Saints after the marriage supper of the lamb and and with for the great battle of Armageddon yes so people are looking for the wrong coming that's why they're expecting you know our plane wrecks and crisis and everything comes to a stop because honestly on that day at the great battle of Armageddon everything will come to stop as the earth burns yes that's right amen yeah well that's interesting that he said as a thief yes you know a thief doesn't come to your house they'll break through the wind and say I'm here to rob you it comes into your home and before you know it he's taking things that you've got and you didn't realize he might have been asleep whatever you get the next morning you realize yes stuffs not there it's gone I've been robbed yeah you know and that's the way the wraps are gonna take place it's gonna be gone happened and done before people realize you know something's happened that's right so this is the rapture is a lot of time where that there everybody's gonna see him on a cloud and and you know everybody will be breaking through the roofs and and going up in the air as pictured by lots of people this mental thought that many people have of a mass exodus of people it's gonna be a secret coming of Christ yes which means that the people are going to be into the tribulation before they even realize what's going on that's right I thought he was gonna come and they're gonna be in the middle of the Great Tribulation right a couple times ago that we we gathered together to our discussions we covered Matthew 24 when he asked three questions when shall these things be what should be the sign of thy kind coming in the end of the world and we had covered that in Matthew 24 that Jesus covers many things that would happen in that day in the judgment of that day and then also speaking of the last days and then people can mix those prophecies together and kind of get it muddled up or confused but it was in Matthew 24 that that Jesus gives a rundown of the sign of his coming the end of the world and so forth but at the close of those comments he begins to repeat himself that no man knows the day or the hour but only the father not even the angels of heaven and then he says there will be two in the field one will be taken and want to be left two in the bed want to be taken and one will be left then he says watch therefore for you know not the hour that the that your Lord doth come so he begins in several places in Matthew 24 he begins to just lay out watch watch and he begins to emphasize and stress watch because it would be something that would be missed and then that's in Matthew 24 Matthew 25 he goes directly into a parable of the coming of the Lord amen and he speaks of ten virgins and he speaks of two groups here two classes of people both are called virgins yeah five are wise and five were foolish and five make it in and five are left outside yeah brother Craig this is wonderful and I think um you know as we wrap up this session today that this will be a very good topic for us to come back to on our next session and we'll be able to talk about the foolish and and the wise virgins and also this part about no man knoweth the day or the hour I think there's any very exciting things that we can talk about so god bless you today as we wrap up this session of this discussion today we are glad that you join with us and look forward to seeing again you again next week god bless thank you for joining the ministry team at evening light tabernacle for more
