Description:
Original song by Samuel Patton

Never Knew How Broken

Verse
I came scarred, I came in pieces
Might have looked strong but I really came in weakness
I came beat down
At the end of my rope and without hope I came

Chorus
I never knew how broken
I never knew how deeply scarred 
I never knew the layers that covered up my heart
I never knew how empty
No I never knew how lost
Until I came to Jesus
I never knew how broken

Verse
Down and out, Nowhere to turn
Wandering aimlessly with no lessons learned
At the bottom
I surrendered everything that I was to Him

Verse
A Rejected King crowned in thorns
His ribs showed through from the stripes He bore
Mocked and beaten
On that rugged cross He died for all the lost

Tag
I never knew how empty
No I never knew how lost
Until I came to Jesus
I never knew how broken

Until I came to Jesus
I never knew how broken
