[40:01] amen god bless you john chapter 14 and
[40:04] verse 12.
[40:05] i want to visit these scriptures again
[40:07] this morning
[40:09] as we conclude our our year to
[40:12] this year we spoke on a lot of different
[40:15] things
[40:16] that i think has been really important
[40:19] pertinent to us
[40:20] in this day and hour john 14
[40:24] 12 says verily verily i say unto you he
[40:26] that believeth on me the works that i do
[40:29] shall he do also
[40:30] and greater works than thee shall he do
[40:33] because
[40:34] i go unto my father and whatsoever you
[40:38] shall ask in my name
[40:40] that i will do that the father may be
[40:42] glorified in the son
[40:45] if ye shall ask anything in my name
[40:49] i will do it and then mark 11 21
[40:53] we'll read from there as you remember
[40:56] jesus
[40:56] had passed by fig tree and
[41:00] finding no fruit on it he cursed it
[41:03] and peter calling to remembrance said
[41:07] unto him master
[41:08] behold the victory which thou curses is
[41:10] withered away
[41:12] and jesus answered said unto them have
[41:14] faith
[41:15] in god for verily i say unto you that
[41:18] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[41:22] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[41:24] the sea
[41:25] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[41:27] shall believe that those things which he
[41:30] said
[41:30] and shall come to pass he shall have
[41:32] whatsoever he
[41:34] saith therefore i say unto you what
[41:36] things soever you desire
[41:38] when you pray believe that you receive
[41:40] them
[41:41] and you shall have them amen god bless
[41:44] you can be seated
[41:46] as we looked over the
[41:50] christmas season and time and many many
[41:53] scriptures and thoughts
[41:54] has come to me and i
[41:58] thought as the as um we
[42:01] observed this time in remembrance
[42:05] not that the lord was born on um this
[42:08] time of the year but that he
[42:10] that is just the time that the world is
[42:12] set aside to remember
[42:14] and to observe the birth of the lord and
[42:18] of course
[42:18] it's coupled together with pagan
[42:21] holidays and other things
[42:22] as well um as they have done but still
[42:26] you know to for us it's all about christ
[42:30] amen that god did send a gift into the
[42:32] world and
[42:33] i think about the words that were spoken
[42:36] where
[42:37] is he king of the jews and
[42:40] these were spoken by the wise men as
[42:43] they were seeking him
[42:45] and it just resounds to me today of
[42:49] where is he king
[42:52] you know where is he really truly the
[42:54] king
[42:55] in whose hearts in whose lives
[42:59] i i spoke last sunday on the call for
[43:02] sincerity and
[43:04] i i think it is really time that we make
[43:07] him
[43:07] truly the king that he is truly the king
[43:11] of our lives
[43:12] and that we are part of his domain and
[43:16] you know and then we were looking here
[43:19] in the scripture
[43:20] and i i could not help but
[43:23] remember and think of the qualifications
[43:26] that jesus
[43:27] gives as he as he gives these words
[43:30] these are powerful words that are laid
[43:33] out in the scripture
[43:35] where that um you know that he said if
[43:37] you ask
[43:38] anything in my name i will do it
[43:41] and then he then he says have faith in
[43:44] god and
[43:45] you know sometimes we we wonder do i
[43:48] have
[43:49] faith can i have faith you know do i
[43:51] have faith for
[43:52] for healing or for this miracle or for
[43:55] this need
[43:56] but this is not what he asked you to do
[43:58] he said have faith in god
[44:00] is god able to do it is he able to bring
[44:04] healing or deliverance or this
[44:08] move this mountain that is needed to be
[44:10] moved
[44:11] have faith in god and this is where the
[44:14] requirement lays that
[44:16] your faith is laid not in your ability
[44:19] or even your faith or how strong your
[44:22] faith is or how great of faith you got
[44:25] or how
[44:25] weak it is but that you your faith
[44:29] lays in god and his word
[44:32] that can never fail and then
[44:35] these two things that he said ask
[44:37] anything in my name and i will do it
[44:41] and there there is a truth that lays
[44:44] there because
[44:45] it is only when we come in his name
[44:49] representing him representing his
[44:52] desires and
[44:53] what he wants done with the word and
[44:56] then
[44:56] then the other is shall not doubt in
[44:59] their
[45:00] heart and again this is what we're going
[45:03] to speak on this morning of
[45:05] of believing from the heart because this
[45:08] is
[45:09] the real pre requisite of mountains
[45:13] moving and as we said your mountain may
[45:16] not be a little mountain
[45:18] but jesus now when he was looking it was
[45:20] a little mountain he said if you say to
[45:22] this mountain
[45:23] be thou removed but again we don't have
[45:26] a need for
[45:27] that mountain to be moved but you've got
[45:30] things in your life you've got
[45:32] situations in your heart
[45:35] that you need moved and they're
[45:38] mountains to you
[45:39] they're impossible situations that you
[45:42] know you're incapable of getting around
[45:45] getting over
[45:46] going through but god is able to
[45:49] move that mountain but it comes from the
[45:52] point of when we don't
[45:54] doubt in our heart so there must be a
[45:57] belief
[45:58] from the heart so these are the things
[46:01] that we're going to be
[46:02] uh discovering today as we look at it
[46:05] and
[46:05] i just want to remind you again of what
[46:08] brother branham would tell us
[46:10] in the sermon in albuquerque god in
[46:12] hiding
[46:13] himself in simplicity and and he would
[46:16] talk about a
[46:17] born-again son or daughter of god and he
[46:20] said the blood of
[46:21] jesus so thoroughly cleanses
[46:25] there's no more nothing
[46:29] that the complete word of god rests in
[46:32] them
[46:33] that the very command of their own voice
[46:35] is creative power
[46:37] because in them is the holy ghost
[46:41] now without the holy ghost there's no
[46:42] creative power
[46:44] amen but with the holy ghost there is
[46:47] creative power
[46:48] and this holy ghost is a creator and he
[46:51] makes things
[46:52] comes to pass because he speaks the word
[46:55] and the word spoken becomes
[46:57] god in action how many wants to see god
[46:59] in accent
[47:01] amen this ought to be the desire of our
[47:03] heart now
[47:04] as i said this don't happen at the whim
[47:07] of our human spirit
[47:09] remember this is the holy spirit
[47:12] using your vocal cords speaking through
[47:15] you
[47:16] saying the right things amen and it
[47:19] don't
[47:20] it just does not happen at the whim of
[47:22] your own human
[47:24] spirit where you have these desires or
[47:26] you want this
[47:27] done and and and but it's where a man
[47:31] is so in tune with god that he knows
[47:35] what god wants
[47:36] done with his word amen but
[47:39] but then god could use their voice
[47:43] to move mountain and this is the goal is
[47:46] to become
[47:47] so yielded to god that's why i spoke the
[47:49] sermon on
[47:50] sincerity is because the whole key to
[47:54] the whole thing is to come to it with
[47:56] sincerity
[47:57] to be yielded to god to know
[48:01] what he wants done amen to be
[48:04] moved by the spirit not even your own
[48:07] human compassion we look
[48:08] a lot of times with human compassion and
[48:11] we would fix this problem or we would
[48:13] solve this situation or
[48:15] or even you know if we had that power to
[48:18] do we would heal this
[48:20] person or whatever but to find
[48:23] the the true will of god what god wants
[48:26] done with his word
[48:28] so now there are two thoughts that
[48:30] balances the other
[48:32] and one seems to be of a more of a
[48:35] spontaneous action
[48:37] brother branham would preach about this
[48:39] and we'll refer to some of it perhaps
[48:42] today of
[48:42] why christ speak your commission
[48:46] just why are you crying to me speak you
[48:49] know put
[48:49] you know act on the word put it into
[48:52] into place and into play and make it
[48:55] make it happen
[48:57] so one seems to be spontaneous and the
[48:59] other
[49:00] that he preached was called paul a
[49:02] prisoner
[49:04] of jesus christ and he would he would
[49:06] preach these sermons
[49:08] back to back where he would preach on
[49:11] that spontaneous
[49:13] instantaneous commissioned son of god
[49:17] acting there with a divine authority
[49:20] and yet then he would balance it out
[49:22] with paul a prisoner
[49:25] of jesus christ amen that he was such a
[49:28] prisoner until
[49:30] um you know he he could not move until
[49:33] god
[49:34] said move that he was so yielded
[49:37] so yoked to christ until he could only
[49:41] obey what christ said to do
[49:44] so when when he was moved on by the holy
[49:48] spirit and and this
[49:50] is what i i'd like to see our church as
[49:52] a people
[49:54] learn to yield herself to be
[49:57] moved on by the holy spirit
[50:00] a people yielded insensitive to the
[50:03] working of the holy ghost and to do that
[50:06] it will require more sincerity
[50:09] and many even even the the whole of
[50:12] coming to christ and repenting of your
[50:15] sins
[50:16] it takes a dead earnestness it takes a
[50:19] real sincerity
[50:22] no holding back you know years ago i
[50:25] remember a girl that was kind of going
[50:27] like one of my brothers and you know she
[50:30] was going to straighten up a little bit
[50:32] so that she could uh go with with him
[50:35] to win his favor and whatever she took
[50:38] all her makeup and
[50:40] all her cosmetics and everything and put
[50:43] them in a
[50:44] nice um plastic bag and sealed them up
[50:47] and went and buried them
[50:49] well i mean you know they were right
[50:51] handy when she wanted to go get them
[50:53] again
[50:54] when it didn't work out you see
[50:57] you can not come to christ holding
[51:00] anything back
[51:02] there has to be a complete total
[51:05] surrenders
[51:06] where that you become a prisoner to
[51:09] jesus christ
[51:10] that you yield yourself completely sold
[51:14] out
[51:15] amen holding nothing back and this is a
[51:18] problem many times
[51:19] you know many times people will come to
[51:21] repent around the altar and they do it
[51:24] and they're in their mind but i'm gonna
[51:25] have to give up this and
[51:27] i'm gonna have to give up that and i'll
[51:29] have to i'll lose this friend or
[51:31] i won't be able to do this anymore
[51:34] whatever else and all of those things
[51:36] are you know they're holding on to this
[51:39] all the time
[51:40] trying to say i want to give you my life
[51:42] god and they will never give it because
[51:45] they got a hold of
[51:46] something else that they extend greater
[51:48] than christ
[51:52] and the gospel will only do you any good
[51:55] when you make a full surrenderance
[51:59] you see all all your tears you're
[52:01] weeping you're crying
[52:03] you're you're mourning oh you can be
[52:05] mourning over what you got to give up or
[52:07] you know what kind of life that you
[52:10] really enjoy living and i know i can't
[52:12] do that and be christ too
[52:14] and all of that but you've got to come
[52:16] to that point
[52:18] in your life where you make that full
[52:20] surrender
[52:21] paul a prisoner of jesus christ
[52:25] it is only then where that you really
[52:27] can believe
[52:29] from the heart this is a problem that we
[52:33] face so many times why that
[52:35] so many go down a dry center and come up
[52:38] a wet one
[52:39] when they're baptized because the word
[52:42] of god
[52:43] is if we will repent it will turn from
[52:46] our sins
[52:48] and we will be baptized in his name he
[52:50] would give us the gift of the holy ghost
[52:52] and you make god a liar if he doesn't do
[52:55] that
[52:56] amen because but but when
[52:59] every time you can go right back to the
[53:01] repentance
[53:03] to the surrenders so it takes a full
[53:07] surrender but not only that but
[53:10] it's not just at your conversion that
[53:13] you make that surrenders but
[53:15] your whole life you become a prisoner
[53:18] of jesus christ amen that you're not
[53:22] your own
[53:23] it's not your own thoughts it's not your
[53:25] own way that you're trying to convey
[53:28] amen but it's it is that you want god's
[53:31] will to be done
[53:33] the mountains got to be moved but does
[53:36] god want that mountain moved
[53:38] and when you get in sync with god's word
[53:40] and what
[53:41] god's thoughts are about it then and you
[53:44] can believe from the heart
[53:46] that things are going to happen but
[53:49] until then
[53:50] you're just wasting your breath amen
[53:54] now of course you know the thing about
[53:57] it is is that
[53:58] um many of us get the wrong idea of what
[54:02] we're
[54:02] what we're really supposed to be and
[54:05] what a christian is going to be here in
[54:07] the end time or even
[54:08] even what a prophet is to be you know
[54:11] brother branham talked about this and
[54:13] the message inspiration in fact there's
[54:15] quite a few
[54:16] that i i i they're so redundant
[54:20] i find so many of them that i can't read
[54:22] them all but just a few choice ones this
[54:24] morning
[54:25] where he says god doesn't always tell
[54:28] his prophets everything that's going to
[54:29] happen
[54:31] he just tells him what he wants to god
[54:33] is sovereign
[54:35] so you see prophets are men they are not
[54:38] god
[54:40] they are passions like we have
[54:43] this is why the bible would say about
[54:44] elijah he said elijah
[54:46] a man of light passion is us he said he
[54:50] prayed earnestly that it not rain
[54:53] you see it required an earnest prayer
[54:57] to get the word to come to pass to where
[55:01] elijah could believe from the heart
[55:05] amen and then so yet he knew what god's
[55:08] word was he knew that
[55:10] there was a drought that was abroad he
[55:12] knew there would have to come an
[55:13] end to it and here he brings them right
[55:16] down to the challenge
[55:18] but he prayed earnestly
[55:22] so you know many times you know today
[55:25] it's that frivolous um you know i
[55:28] i'm going to speak this or i'm quoting
[55:31] this scripture or
[55:33] i'm i'm doing a name and claim it type
[55:35] thing
[55:36] rather than coming in with sincerity and
[55:39] honesty and earnesty
[55:44] now again impress every present water
[55:47] from the rock
[55:48] brother branham said i prayed for you
[55:50] all and i need you all to pray for me
[55:53] what a prophet needing us to pray for
[55:57] him
[55:58] he said so the holy ghost holy spirit
[56:00] would just leave me
[56:01] exactly where i should go he said i
[56:04] prayed for you
[56:06] but i need you to pray for me so that
[56:09] i'll
[56:09] make no mistake
[56:13] amen because all of us as humans we're
[56:15] still subject
[56:16] to making mistakes
[56:20] and he said many times you see people
[56:22] thinks that a prophetic gift that god
[56:24] just says
[56:25] i'll pick you up right here and set you
[56:26] down here and you
[56:28] and you just go over here and he does he
[56:31] doesn't tell you all those things if he
[56:32] did
[56:33] then what kind of overcoming faith did
[56:35] you have see
[56:36] he lets you stand alone more than
[56:39] anybody else
[56:41] and he said you could all come to me and
[56:43] ask for certain things and he's never
[56:45] failed yet he's given you
[56:46] the answer that's right yeah but i ask
[56:49] him for things for myself
[56:50] and many times he just left me alone
[56:53] see just lets me go ahead and walk into
[56:56] it and i have things
[56:59] now that i have to solve out myself and
[57:02] decisions i have to make
[57:04] and this is such a vital one until i
[57:06] cannot exactly make it
[57:08] until i'm sure that it's him speaking to
[57:11] me and he won't give me a vision
[57:14] and he just lets me alone so i'm just
[57:17] setting as an orphan like this morning i
[57:20] don't know which way to turn
[57:22] so i've committed it to the lord
[57:27] now you can see here is a prophet
[57:30] of even a seventh church age messenger
[57:34] that is in such a place that he he is
[57:38] required
[57:38] to seek the lord and man it's not just
[57:42] handed to him on a platter it just
[57:45] doesn't fall out of the skies
[57:48] it's something that he has to dedicate
[57:50] himself and earnestly contend
[57:52] for and this is what the scripture is
[57:55] saying earnestly
[57:56] contend for the faith that was once
[57:59] delivered to the saints
[58:01] it's something you got to put everything
[58:03] you have into it
[58:05] it's not something that just going to
[58:07] come easy
[58:08] because you're here in laodicea you are
[58:11] fraught with every kind of situation
[58:15] amen there's every kind of thing going
[58:17] on around you every kind of distraction
[58:21] all kinds of voices that will crowd out
[58:24] the voice of god
[58:26] are you with me and you're going to have
[58:28] to press
[58:30] into it with all your heart
[58:35] remember it's the day you seek me with
[58:37] all your heart
[58:39] that's the day you find me
[58:42] no half-hearted way it's gonna work
[58:47] no i have sincerity is going to work
[58:51] it's going to take putting everything
[58:53] you got into it
[58:55] you say brother tim is is that so let me
[58:59] just tell you
[59:00] you know daniel daniel was
[59:03] looking into the scripture and he could
[59:05] read by the books
[59:07] he could read by the books of where they
[59:09] were that the time
[59:11] for being in babylon was over amen that
[59:14] the 70 years had
[59:16] expired that god had told jeremiah they
[59:18] would spend down
[59:19] in the land of babylon the word was
[59:22] there to be fulfilled
[59:24] but somebody had to start praying for
[59:26] his fulfillment
[59:29] and god begins to move on the heart of
[59:31] daniel and he said i've read in the
[59:33] books
[59:34] amen and we ought to be able to read in
[59:36] the books that we're here at the end of
[59:38] the laodicean age
[59:40] that the last messenger has come that
[59:43] we're here in the last days
[59:45] amen that evil men and seducers watch
[59:47] worse and worse
[59:49] and that because iniquity abounds the
[59:51] love of many wax coals
[59:53] and and we see the the situations that
[59:56] we're living in
[59:57] in this kind of time and daniel began to
[1:00:00] set his face toward god to pray
[1:00:05] but it took three weeks
[1:00:09] 21 days before the angel come
[1:00:12] and he said i was held back
[1:00:16] by the prince of babylon prince of
[1:00:18] persia
[1:00:19] right i was held back from coming
[1:00:23] you know no doubt you know here daniel's
[1:00:25] the third
[1:00:26] ruler in the kingdom no doubt in the
[1:00:29] middle of his prayers you know he's
[1:00:31] he's pulled this way and somebody wants
[1:00:33] an answer here and
[1:00:34] you know there's got this has to be done
[1:00:36] and you know he's distracted here
[1:00:39] and and here he's he's pulling there but
[1:00:41] there's another war going on
[1:00:44] and that's with the prince of persia
[1:00:46] who's keeping life so busy
[1:00:50] and i want you to know the prince that
[1:00:52] rules laodicea
[1:00:55] the evil one is doing everything that he
[1:00:58] can
[1:00:59] to keep you so harried and pulled down
[1:01:01] and worried
[1:01:04] and your mind on everything else and
[1:01:07] constantly fraught with every kind of
[1:01:09] trouble till you can't find the will of
[1:01:11] god for your life
[1:01:15] but daniel kept pressing he said now i
[1:01:18] heard you from the first day you prayed
[1:01:22] but because of this because of these
[1:01:25] obstacles that was
[1:01:26] that came and the prince of persia put
[1:01:29] in my way
[1:01:30] it hindered me from getting to you
[1:01:33] many of you are seeking an answer and
[1:01:36] perhaps you're desiring something but
[1:01:37] are you perseverant
[1:01:39] maybe you give up
[1:01:42] just before the angel gets to you
[1:01:48] i you know i that brings to my
[1:01:50] remembrance a man
[1:01:52] in the audience there he was crippled
[1:01:55] and brother branham sees him gets up and
[1:01:57] he walks out
[1:01:58] of the meeting and he
[1:02:01] as he walks out the meeting brother
[1:02:03] branham said that man
[1:02:04] sitting there a crippled man he said i
[1:02:08] watched a dark spirit come in and get
[1:02:10] him and take him out
[1:02:14] he said he will never be healed
[1:02:18] now you think you're that close
[1:02:21] to your deliverance right that close
[1:02:25] that you're there
[1:02:26] in the very presence of god and you
[1:02:29] allow
[1:02:30] an evil spirit to come in and distract
[1:02:32] you pull you away
[1:02:35] put some darkness upon you
[1:02:42] now it's really
[1:02:45] important that we
[1:02:48] even for every service that we put
[1:02:50] everything we got into it
[1:02:54] and that we we come here with sincerity
[1:02:57] and with dedication and consecration
[1:02:59] because you know just just one thing
[1:03:03] one thing could cause somebody from to
[1:03:05] not get their deliverance
[1:03:07] just one wrong attitude
[1:03:10] so it's really important that we come
[1:03:12] with the right attitude
[1:03:14] amen and in the spirit under the
[1:03:16] anointing
[1:03:18] now brother bradham said you'll never be
[1:03:21] able to see
[1:03:22] men going around the world just healing
[1:03:24] people at random and everything i
[1:03:27] tried to knock that down as hard as i
[1:03:28] could in my life that's the reason
[1:03:30] you're watching the campaigns i watch
[1:03:32] solemnly first to see the vision
[1:03:34] what god will say and then you for you
[1:03:36] might stomp
[1:03:37] and kick and anoint and everything else
[1:03:40] and if the devil
[1:03:42] has a right in there anything in your
[1:03:44] heart unconfessed
[1:03:47] or any unbelief or doubting
[1:03:50] anything in there anything that you
[1:03:53] refuse to do
[1:03:54] or not the devil will lay right there
[1:03:59] because he has a right to he said that's
[1:04:02] right jesus
[1:04:03] never healed it random he said i'd do
[1:04:06] nothing except the father shows me first
[1:04:09] and you'll never be
[1:04:10] on the plane with jesus as he says now
[1:04:12] so if you just
[1:04:13] if you look at this just for a moment i
[1:04:15] want you to get this
[1:04:17] that this is important to understand
[1:04:19] will never do
[1:04:20] will never heal at random
[1:04:26] we'll never just go out and and do
[1:04:28] things on our
[1:04:29] on our own with our own ambition
[1:04:33] it'll only be as the impulse or the
[1:04:36] leadership of the holy ghost
[1:04:39] and realizing that even even there we
[1:04:42] we have a commission now we can do the
[1:04:44] commission the commission is
[1:04:47] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:04:48] recover
[1:04:50] the commission is in my name cast out
[1:04:52] devils
[1:04:54] amen those are the commissions when we
[1:04:57] have the right as a commission but
[1:04:59] satan also knows his rights
[1:05:02] and as long as there's unconfessed sin
[1:05:05] some
[1:05:05] doubt in the heart some unbelief that
[1:05:08] will not be
[1:05:10] let go up remember remember many times
[1:05:14] people worship of spirit
[1:05:18] do you know there are some people just
[1:05:19] love to be sick
[1:05:23] they do they love the attention that it
[1:05:26] brings and
[1:05:27] i have this and i have that and you know
[1:05:30] and they glorify all of this
[1:05:34] they they enjoy it they enjoy the
[1:05:36] attention
[1:05:37] that it brings
[1:05:41] it's the truth do you realize do you
[1:05:43] realize brother branham when he
[1:05:45] dealt with that maniac and they and he
[1:05:48] fell at his feet there in portland
[1:05:50] oregon
[1:05:51] you remember there as he lay at his feet
[1:05:54] and
[1:05:54] and the policeman ran up and asked is he
[1:05:57] delivered and he said no
[1:05:59] well he had fallen out it was rendered
[1:06:02] powerless but he wasn't delivered
[1:06:04] he said no he's not delivered said he
[1:06:06] worships that spirit
[1:06:10] and only until he quit worshiping that
[1:06:13] spirit you see
[1:06:14] that's the thing you've got to hate sin
[1:06:20] and mind you you can't just you know
[1:06:22] play with it and say
[1:06:23] you know and it's your little toy that
[1:06:26] you play with
[1:06:26] you've got to hate it you've got to come
[1:06:29] to the point i
[1:06:30] don't want nothing to do with it hey man
[1:06:34] i'm sick of it i'm
[1:06:35] tired of it i'm weary of it and it'll
[1:06:38] not rule my life again
[1:06:40] i'm going to be free from this i'll not
[1:06:43] serve it another day
[1:06:48] because until you get dead earnest there
[1:06:51] will never be deliverance for you
[1:06:55] amen now this is really really important
[1:07:00] because people's deliverance can be so
[1:07:02] far away from them
[1:07:04] because of their lack of sincerity they
[1:07:07] won't believe from the heart
[1:07:10] oh in their mind oh yeah i i i know it's
[1:07:13] hurting my
[1:07:14] kids i know it's hurting my family i
[1:07:15] know it's it's living a
[1:07:17] miserable life but until you hate it
[1:07:24] until you come to the point i don't want
[1:07:26] no more to do with this
[1:07:30] this will no longer be my king
[1:07:34] here comes the question back where is he
[1:07:36] king
[1:07:38] i'm looking at men and women today that
[1:07:40] he's your king
[1:07:42] amen he is your king he has he has
[1:07:45] dominion over your life you are his
[1:07:47] servants
[1:07:48] you belong to him amen you're even a
[1:07:52] prisoner of love to him
[1:07:54] you're bound with him by love change you
[1:07:56] wouldn't hurt him for nothing
[1:07:58] you don't want to do wrong anymore the
[1:08:01] desires have been changed
[1:08:05] am i why because you come to that point
[1:08:07] you believe from the heart
[1:08:10] now again in as you know
[1:08:14] let me let me just talk about
[1:08:16] expectations yes
[1:08:17] we we are a people of tremendous
[1:08:20] expectations
[1:08:22] we're not looking to see the bride
[1:08:23] become weaker and weaker and weaker and
[1:08:25] weaker
[1:08:26] as we go along and leave out of here a
[1:08:29] powerless group of people
[1:08:31] no we're looking at a people who will be
[1:08:34] triumphant overcomers
[1:08:38] a people who know their god and does
[1:08:40] exploits
[1:08:42] a people where the spirit of god moves
[1:08:44] and there is deliverance
[1:08:46] and salvation and healing
[1:08:49] amen that's exactly what our
[1:08:51] expectations are
[1:08:53] amount of people who instead of getting
[1:08:55] less
[1:08:56] having less faith than people of great
[1:08:58] faith
[1:08:59] great grace a rapture and grace and a
[1:09:01] rapture in faith
[1:09:04] that's our expectations and even brother
[1:09:07] branham was
[1:09:08] talking to a man you know as he and this
[1:09:10] is a part of this quote that i just read
[1:09:12] from inspiration
[1:09:13] where jesus never healed at random and
[1:09:16] he said a man come to me a minister
[1:09:18] um who does from a denomination who
[1:09:21] doesn't believe in miracles and i'm just
[1:09:22] paraphrasing all of this
[1:09:24] he doesn't even believe in the baptism
[1:09:26] of the holy spirit
[1:09:28] he said listen preacher if you're an
[1:09:30] apostle of your prophet he said hey i'm
[1:09:32] neither one
[1:09:33] i'm a servant of jesus christ if you're
[1:09:35] a healer he said i'm not the healer i
[1:09:37] never did say that the lord is a healer
[1:09:40] and he says but if you were apostles
[1:09:42] like they were only he said just say by
[1:09:44] his grace
[1:09:46] well then he said um then if you're like
[1:09:48] one of the apostles who had the holy
[1:09:50] ghost
[1:09:50] you claimed out the holy ghost yes i do
[1:09:53] he said okay
[1:09:54] he said now you're talking that i have
[1:09:56] the holy ghost just like they had
[1:09:59] and he said well why don't you go to the
[1:10:00] hospital and every one of the sick
[1:10:02] people every one of them just say
[1:10:04] i will obey you and get up and walk out
[1:10:07] so you just say to them get up and walk
[1:10:09] out and they will obey you
[1:10:11] and he says okay but do you believe
[1:10:14] jesus still saves
[1:10:17] and he said well yeah i do he said well
[1:10:19] go to the honky tonks
[1:10:21] to the bar rooms to the racetracks and
[1:10:24] say every one of you
[1:10:25] are now christians you know come out and
[1:10:27] get away from the world
[1:10:29] he said i could do that if they would
[1:10:31] believe and he said so could i
[1:10:34] because it's on the atonement amen but
[1:10:37] jesus never brought deliverance when he
[1:10:41] didn't find faith
[1:10:44] and this is what he's looking for
[1:10:46] somebody to believe
[1:10:48] amen if he can get you to believe from
[1:10:51] your heart
[1:10:54] the mountain's got to move now watch
[1:10:57] this
[1:10:57] he said um he he he went on to say
[1:11:01] um about about that and he said um
[1:11:05] he said well you know he said well why
[1:11:08] why can't we do it he said you know paul
[1:11:11] he left a friend sick
[1:11:13] he left timothy with his stomach trouble
[1:11:16] they were doing the best they could do
[1:11:17] with what they had to
[1:11:19] do with jesus had the spirit without
[1:11:22] measure
[1:11:23] and we got it by measure so he said how
[1:11:26] could you condemn a man
[1:11:28] and said you know i talk about some
[1:11:31] failures so why don't we talk about
[1:11:32] success
[1:11:34] if you're a christian of course he said
[1:11:35] his heart was far away from god by
[1:11:37] theological experience that he had and
[1:11:40] and so all his faith was mental faith
[1:11:43] and so he he said um well he said i
[1:11:46] heard you saying one of your sermons
[1:11:48] jesus said the things i do say you do
[1:11:50] also
[1:11:50] said you know let's see you break bread
[1:11:52] then and feed five thousand
[1:11:54] let me see you turn water in the wine
[1:11:56] and brother bradley said and i want you
[1:11:58] to watch these words
[1:11:59] we are in our infancy
[1:12:03] we are moving up and just as quick as we
[1:12:06] can get you bunch of fanatics
[1:12:08] out of the way we'll be doing that
[1:12:13] he said now healing's not questioning
[1:12:15] anymore even the doctors recognize it
[1:12:18] but he said if we can get a bunch of
[1:12:20] unbelievers out of the way long enough
[1:12:21] to get
[1:12:22] god moving to the crowd you'll see
[1:12:24] things happen
[1:12:25] take place we are just moving up look at
[1:12:28] the miracles that jesus started the same
[1:12:30] way
[1:12:30] and then he moved right on finally to
[1:12:33] the resurrection of the dead
[1:12:36] listen we're looking for a crescendo of
[1:12:38] this thing
[1:12:40] the dead in christ arise not just from
[1:12:43] our ages but for seven ages
[1:12:46] amen this is exactly right you know
[1:12:48] jesus jesus there
[1:12:50] would experience healings deliverance
[1:12:53] and then he you know would have
[1:12:54] resurrections with his son at name
[1:12:56] jairus's daughter and then then a
[1:12:59] incredible
[1:13:00] miracle of lazarus who was dead for days
[1:13:06] amen it caused such a stir they even
[1:13:08] want to kill lazarus
[1:13:11] and man jealousy overtook them the word
[1:13:13] they wanted to kill
[1:13:15] lazarus because his testimony was was
[1:13:18] winning
[1:13:18] so many of a man four days dead
[1:13:22] alive again but that was nothing in
[1:13:25] comparison
[1:13:26] to the resurrected of all the sainted
[1:13:28] dead at his resurrection
[1:13:30] amen or when he rose from the dead on
[1:13:32] the third day
[1:13:33] come on that's exactly right so you see
[1:13:37] there there again we're looking for
[1:13:40] greater climaxes
[1:13:41] all the time and expecting greater
[1:13:44] things
[1:13:45] but to do it remember it's going to take
[1:13:48] up more
[1:13:49] sincerity than ever before and people
[1:13:52] believe in
[1:13:53] from their heart see jesus said
[1:13:57] to us say to this mountain you've heard
[1:13:59] about what's been taking place that's a
[1:14:01] ministry
[1:14:02] we're entering into and truly you know
[1:14:04] brother branham said
[1:14:06] you know you know this man was saying
[1:14:09] you know take some bread and break it
[1:14:10] and feed five thousand you do the works
[1:14:12] jesus did and jesus said
[1:14:14] greater than thee shall you do
[1:14:18] and what happened squirrels were created
[1:14:20] out of nothing
[1:14:22] is that right amen it was showing now
[1:14:26] what could be done to through a man
[1:14:29] yielded to god not that everybody's
[1:14:32] going to go out and
[1:14:33] create squirrels but that there is
[1:14:37] what a man surrendered to the will of
[1:14:39] god everybody don't need to
[1:14:41] move that mountain over in jerusalem
[1:14:44] amen everybody doesn't need to create a
[1:14:46] squirrel
[1:14:47] but there are things that needs to be
[1:14:50] done
[1:14:50] power of creation that needs to work in
[1:14:53] your home life
[1:14:55] in your own life
[1:14:58] is that right amen and it must be done
[1:15:02] listen again i believe that god has
[1:15:06] has given us a great time you know where
[1:15:09] we've had a great time of of of learning
[1:15:12] to lean on him making surrender sin god
[1:15:16] purging a lot of the faults out
[1:15:20] all of the all of the super spiritual
[1:15:23] i spoke in tongues i shouted i'd dance
[1:15:25] and god's allowed
[1:15:27] a lot of these things of superficial
[1:15:30] prophecies and
[1:15:31] you know ye saith the lord i bless you
[1:15:33] and all these things just kind of
[1:15:35] fade out of the way where that until
[1:15:38] people
[1:15:39] become so full of the word
[1:15:42] knowing their god so they could do
[1:15:45] exploits and be
[1:15:46] a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:15:50] are you with me amen so god has allowed
[1:15:53] us time to
[1:15:54] sit back and grow and we've learned the
[1:15:57] great deep
[1:15:58] mysteries of the word i mean we we
[1:16:01] have been given the revelation of
[1:16:04] of things that are happening in our day
[1:16:07] we've trailed
[1:16:08] the serpent all the way from the
[1:16:10] beginning all the way down to the end
[1:16:12] we we see the the great um
[1:16:16] moving of the holy spirit as as the
[1:16:18] seven seals were open and
[1:16:20] the mysterious thunders were revealed to
[1:16:23] a messenger of god
[1:16:25] all of these things that god has done to
[1:16:28] place us
[1:16:28] in the word we can be sane solid
[1:16:32] christians
[1:16:35] amen but now you know i think we have
[1:16:39] learned to be like paul
[1:16:41] a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:16:45] but now it is time to move into the
[1:16:48] authority
[1:16:49] and the power that god gave us as
[1:16:51] believers
[1:16:53] to know how to yield to the spirit to be
[1:16:57] led by the holy ghost you know in blind
[1:17:00] bartimaeus brother
[1:17:02] branham would re-emphasize some of these
[1:17:03] things he said no man at any time in the
[1:17:06] bible
[1:17:07] or ever will in any age to come
[1:17:10] while we're mortal of course when we
[1:17:12] leave this we won't need it
[1:17:13] but no man at any time from adam to the
[1:17:16] present day
[1:17:17] or will be until jesus comes again will
[1:17:20] ever be able to perform
[1:17:21] miracles at his own disposal he never
[1:17:25] did
[1:17:25] even the son of god or no prophet it was
[1:17:28] always by divine vision
[1:17:30] that god showed him what to do the bible
[1:17:32] said so
[1:17:33] so if jesus could do nothing himself but
[1:17:35] had to wait to see
[1:17:37] what the father would show him to do so
[1:17:40] you know we get the wrong picture of
[1:17:41] jesus
[1:17:43] even jesus we get the wrong picture of
[1:17:46] him saying well brother timmy was god in
[1:17:48] the flesh and yes he was
[1:17:50] and he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:17:52] bodily not a portion
[1:17:54] is that right but let me just read these
[1:17:57] little snippets
[1:17:58] jesus didn't just go around at random
[1:18:00] and do this
[1:18:01] and that and do this you got the wrong
[1:18:04] conception of him
[1:18:07] it wasn't given to him just to take the
[1:18:09] blessings of god
[1:18:10] and throw them out any way he wished to
[1:18:14] there's never been a man even to the son
[1:18:16] of man the son of god
[1:18:18] who could ever say within himself he did
[1:18:20] anything outside of god
[1:18:24] and man in john 5 and verse 17 you see
[1:18:27] jesus answered him my father worketh
[1:18:30] hitherto and i work
[1:18:33] you see jesus worked as the father
[1:18:35] worked
[1:18:36] he explains this you know again in john
[1:18:39] 5
[1:18:39] 19 he said then jesus said unto them
[1:18:42] verily verily i say to you the son of
[1:18:44] man can do
[1:18:46] nothing of himself
[1:18:51] but what he seeth the father do
[1:18:55] for whatsoever he doeth these also
[1:18:58] do it the son likewise
[1:19:01] so even jesus said you know it's not me
[1:19:04] that doeth the works
[1:19:06] it's my father that dwelleth in me
[1:19:08] that's john 14 10 believe it's not that
[1:19:10] i'm in the father the father in me
[1:19:12] that the words that i speak unto you i
[1:19:15] speak not of myself
[1:19:16] but the father dwelleth in me he
[1:19:19] doeth the works
[1:19:23] again no prophet no seer
[1:19:26] ever done anything at random god shows
[1:19:29] first
[1:19:30] so no human flesh not even the flesh of
[1:19:33] jesus himself can glorify it's
[1:19:36] all in god god does the showing the
[1:19:38] seeing we just act it out
[1:19:40] as he shows us and tells us each one of
[1:19:43] us does that
[1:19:45] again in uh when their eyes is open you
[1:19:48] bible scholars
[1:19:49] you have been looking for a superman to
[1:19:51] come
[1:19:53] that does things just at random he will
[1:19:56] go out and whatever he wants to do he
[1:19:58] does it
[1:19:59] that never was in the bible and it will
[1:20:02] never be done by
[1:20:03] mortal beings in the will of god if
[1:20:06] jesus christ no man ever lived a life
[1:20:08] above his no prophet any time
[1:20:10] ever do anything without first god
[1:20:13] telling to do it first search the
[1:20:15] scriptures and see if that's
[1:20:16] all right it's always it's not the will
[1:20:18] of man it's the will of god
[1:20:20] being shown to man and you pentecostal
[1:20:24] brothers he said in the message look
[1:20:26] let me drop this to you you're looking
[1:20:28] for a time to come
[1:20:30] when there's going to be men rise up on
[1:20:32] the earth
[1:20:33] go out in the hospitals and deliver them
[1:20:35] and say the whole hospital move out
[1:20:38] don't you never be deceived like that
[1:20:40] you believe me if you believe that's a
[1:20:42] lie
[1:20:42] it never was done
[1:20:46] amen now jesus made it clear
[1:20:51] that without him we can do nothing
[1:20:55] that's john 15 5 i'm divine you're the
[1:20:58] branches
[1:21:00] he that abideth in me i and him the same
[1:21:02] bringeth forth
[1:21:03] much fruit for without me
[1:21:07] you can do nothing
[1:21:14] so now we understand real clearly that
[1:21:18] anything that we're going to do has got
[1:21:20] to be dependent on him
[1:21:22] therefore there must be a sincere
[1:21:26] continual contact with the working of
[1:21:29] the holy spirit
[1:21:32] are you with me now notice what he says
[1:21:35] you know we we don't look for a superman
[1:21:37] but i want to tell you we do look for a
[1:21:40] super church
[1:21:42] one led by the holy ghost heaven
[1:21:45] thus saith the lord or keep still
[1:21:49] amen you're waiting to see what does god
[1:21:52] want done with this
[1:21:54] you're moved by the holy ghost and it
[1:21:57] takes that
[1:21:58] someone that is relying upon god
[1:22:02] not just a haphazard affair but a life
[1:22:05] that is
[1:22:05] living in contact with the holy spirit
[1:22:09] this is what i'm talking about when i'm
[1:22:11] saying there's a call for a greater
[1:22:13] sincerity
[1:22:15] a greater dedication where that men and
[1:22:18] women
[1:22:18] are in contact with the almighty where
[1:22:21] they can be
[1:22:22] moved on by the holy ghost now
[1:22:25] the third pull it will not be people
[1:22:27] just speaking at a whim
[1:22:29] you know none of the times that that
[1:22:31] happened with brother branham when you
[1:22:33] when you talk about the squirrels the
[1:22:35] storm the hatty right
[1:22:37] when you talk about the tumor of his
[1:22:39] wife um
[1:22:40] you know the resurrection of the little
[1:22:43] fish
[1:22:43] the five times that it was manifest none
[1:22:46] of those times
[1:22:48] did he say i think i'll walk out here
[1:22:50] and create a squirrel today
[1:22:55] i i think i'm you know i
[1:22:58] i want to hunt here a little longer i'll
[1:23:00] speak to this storm
[1:23:03] um you know i want to see these kids
[1:23:06] saved here so i'll just
[1:23:08] you know just pronounce something over
[1:23:10] them
[1:23:12] none of it every time it was
[1:23:16] god saying
[1:23:20] it was god putting words in his mouth
[1:23:22] but now
[1:23:24] it took his faith to put into action
[1:23:29] he said you know it was my faith that
[1:23:32] created those squirrels but he said it
[1:23:34] was
[1:23:35] it was my faith in what he challenged me
[1:23:39] to ask oh that there be a people today
[1:23:43] so in tune with him
[1:23:45] amen that they know what he wants done
[1:23:47] with his word
[1:23:49] that they're moving in the spirit
[1:23:51] they're directed by the holy ghost
[1:23:53] i had a great friend um you know that i
[1:23:56] knew
[1:23:56] for many many years he's he's gone on
[1:23:59] to be with the lord now his name was
[1:24:02] winston eason
[1:24:03] and when he was 19 years old he dove
[1:24:05] into a
[1:24:06] bar pit over here in louisiana near near
[1:24:09] louisiana tech
[1:24:10] hit something on the bottom snapped his
[1:24:12] neck he was a quad quadriplegic the rest
[1:24:15] of his life
[1:24:18] he had a great testimony of how god
[1:24:20] brought him to
[1:24:21] christ he was agnostic or
[1:24:26] an atheist you know he was one of these
[1:24:29] he was
[1:24:29] one of these smart young men he was
[1:24:31] raised by church of christ
[1:24:32] grandma his mom and dad had split up and
[1:24:35] and he
[1:24:36] he was so bitter on the inside he come
[1:24:39] to a point he said i don't even believe
[1:24:40] in god
[1:24:42] god is around with a bunch of college
[1:24:43] kids you know and
[1:24:45] they were the the the smart ones and
[1:24:48] listening to all the professors and
[1:24:50] whatever talked them out of being
[1:24:52] there even being a god i don't even
[1:24:54] believe in a god i i never seen god
[1:24:56] religion is just a hoax he
[1:25:00] he would see the church of christ
[1:25:01] preachers and the way that they would
[1:25:03] act and do
[1:25:04] and things and living immorally in sin
[1:25:07] and
[1:25:07] he lost faith altogether one day
[1:25:11] a man witnessed to him and and tried to
[1:25:14] get him to come to a meeting another
[1:25:15] young
[1:25:16] teenager and he said uh no he said i
[1:25:19] don't even believe in god he said aren't
[1:25:20] you afraid to say that he said no
[1:25:22] i'm not afraid to say that at all and
[1:25:25] there
[1:25:26] that there that night when he laid down
[1:25:29] on on to go to sleep there
[1:25:33] something just began to prick his
[1:25:34] conscience and he said oh
[1:25:36] if there is a god somehow
[1:25:40] show me yourself and he went on to sleep
[1:25:44] and a couple of days later he's a
[1:25:45] quadriplegic
[1:25:49] and there's a whole story of where god
[1:25:52] moved on that man
[1:25:54] visited him in in dreams with the angels
[1:25:57] showed him how to be baptized in the
[1:25:59] name of jesus christ
[1:26:00] it was the first time that i ever ever
[1:26:03] ever um
[1:26:04] heard the man's name a phone call he'd
[1:26:06] come into our home
[1:26:07] when we was living in bossier this is
[1:26:09] about 1962
[1:26:11] and and there you know this young man
[1:26:14] was seeking to be baptized
[1:26:16] in the name of jesus christ i'm looking
[1:26:18] for people to baptize me
[1:26:20] in the name of jesus christ because i
[1:26:23] had an angelic visitation
[1:26:25] that as i was baptizing somebody you
[1:26:28] know and there i was baptized in the
[1:26:30] name of father son the holy ghost and an
[1:26:32] angel stood there
[1:26:33] in a white robe and said no you're doing
[1:26:35] it wrong baptize them
[1:26:36] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[1:26:39] he
[1:26:40] obeyed the angel when he did the glory
[1:26:42] of god filled the place
[1:26:44] anyway god would lead this young man and
[1:26:48] and for whatever reason and i don't know
[1:26:52] i don't know the reason sometimes you
[1:26:54] know you want to help
[1:26:55] suffering humanity sometimes you want to
[1:26:59] you see something and
[1:27:00] you want to put your hands on you you'd
[1:27:02] like to help in that situation
[1:27:04] you'd like to see that person well and
[1:27:06] healed and
[1:27:07] walking but maybe it might be the very
[1:27:11] thing
[1:27:13] that is needed to be
[1:27:16] the chain upon his life to keep him
[1:27:20] walking and humble with god
[1:27:25] amen i've seen sister rachel's not her
[1:27:29] head
[1:27:30] there that was her grandfather
[1:27:33] their um brother carl williams full
[1:27:35] gospel businessman
[1:27:37] he was there crippled up with arthritis
[1:27:41] his hands all crippled up and his legs
[1:27:43] has crippled and
[1:27:44] he was went to prayer line and and you
[1:27:47] know a bit barely able to walk and was
[1:27:49] freed
[1:27:50] dare to walk with great strides but his
[1:27:53] hands were still crippled
[1:27:56] he went to brother branham and said to
[1:27:58] brother branham said
[1:27:59] brother branham but my hands my hands
[1:28:02] you know god did a great miracle here
[1:28:04] but my hands he said carl
[1:28:06] if god healed your hands said you'd be
[1:28:08] out there
[1:28:09] with the oil with the water wells and
[1:28:11] working out there instead of doing what
[1:28:13] he wants you to do
[1:28:16] sometimes you don't know why that we
[1:28:19] sometimes
[1:28:19] go through what we got we we'll
[1:28:21] understand it all better by and by
[1:28:24] but anyway winston you know he wanted
[1:28:26] very much to be healed he would dream of
[1:28:28] being healed he'd be
[1:28:29] dream he would dream of walking down the
[1:28:31] road and he's healed in fact of the
[1:28:33] matter is
[1:28:34] well you know he was pondering about um
[1:28:37] about uh brother branham being elijah
[1:28:40] the prophet and was wondering
[1:28:43] was he truly that elijah people were
[1:28:46] talking about he's that elijah
[1:28:48] and he saw himself walking right down
[1:28:51] on highway 7. now you don't know where
[1:28:53] highway 7 is anymore
[1:28:55] but 371 took its place as
[1:28:58] a as took louisiana highway 7 down
[1:29:01] and took its place and widened the road
[1:29:03] out and straightened it out
[1:29:04] made it a hurricane corridor made a
[1:29:07] united states highway
[1:29:09] and somewhere right about here where the
[1:29:11] church is built
[1:29:14] he was walking in his dream and an angel
[1:29:17] come down and
[1:29:18] started walking with him and looked over
[1:29:21] at him and
[1:29:22] gave him a message and said yes william
[1:29:24] branham is
[1:29:26] that messenger of malachi 4.
[1:29:30] just think about that and we built a
[1:29:32] church right here on that highway 7
[1:29:35] right here where the angel visited now
[1:29:38] speaking of that you know he was there
[1:29:41] in tampa florida
[1:29:43] following brother branham around from
[1:29:45] meeting to meeting and
[1:29:46] desiring to be healed and
[1:29:50] and he got to go to the full gospel
[1:29:54] businessmen's
[1:29:55] meeting and was sat at the breakfast and
[1:29:57] got to sit across from
[1:29:59] brother branham there at the table and
[1:30:02] they wheeled him up there across from
[1:30:04] brother branham and brother branham and
[1:30:06] him
[1:30:06] talked there for a little bit and
[1:30:10] and he began to speak to him and brother
[1:30:12] branham took him by
[1:30:13] his left hand just to see if there was a
[1:30:16] a germ
[1:30:17] disease or something that was there as
[1:30:19] he was talking to him
[1:30:21] and and held his hand as he looked at
[1:30:24] him and he said
[1:30:24] brother branham i've heard about the
[1:30:26] squirrels you'll find this on
[1:30:28] on the message of paradox it's not
[1:30:31] exactly the way i'm going to tell it
[1:30:32] this morning because i'm telling
[1:30:34] winston's side of it
[1:30:35] and and and he said i've heard about the
[1:30:38] squirrels and
[1:30:39] hattie wright and the third pull and i
[1:30:41] believe those things
[1:30:44] and he says brother branham if you'll
[1:30:45] just tell me
[1:30:47] that i can walk out of here that's all i
[1:30:49] want you to do just speak the word
[1:30:52] and i'll get up here and walk out and he
[1:30:54] said
[1:30:55] brother brandon said i thought how
[1:30:56] lovely
[1:30:58] you see he said i think that's where
[1:31:00] brethren gets off track
[1:31:02] god let them do something with a little
[1:31:04] faith and then they feel like everything
[1:31:06] they bounce into they just say it and
[1:31:08] that's all
[1:31:09] but you see how can i say dust saith the
[1:31:12] lord
[1:31:13] unless he tells me first i've got to
[1:31:16] have it first if it didn't
[1:31:17] i'd say that's saith william branham but
[1:31:19] that wouldn't do any good you see
[1:31:21] he's got to tell me first
[1:31:24] said a man drove up in an ambulance with
[1:31:28] some babies and i was
[1:31:29] real busy and he said um you know the
[1:31:32] the ambulance driver said just
[1:31:34] tell me that the babies would be all
[1:31:36] right and
[1:31:37] and i thought well how lovely but how
[1:31:39] can i say that until i know it
[1:31:41] he said some people just got an
[1:31:43] impression the lord
[1:31:45] told me to do this impressions
[1:31:50] that's where there's that's where a lot
[1:31:52] of things has had to die
[1:31:54] out where we're just going on
[1:31:57] impressions
[1:31:58] human compassion even human desires
[1:32:02] but to be led of the holy spirit
[1:32:07] amen and he says well he said well
[1:32:09] that's just yourself many times
[1:32:11] you've got to see it and know it he said
[1:32:14] then he turned to a
[1:32:15] minister brother and said how can i say
[1:32:17] brother fox say
[1:32:18] he'll say something you know how could
[1:32:21] he say or say something
[1:32:22] if he's honest and brother branham said
[1:32:24] so and so and if i didn't say it
[1:32:26] he's falsely accusing me of saying
[1:32:28] something i didn't say
[1:32:29] but if i really said it then i've got to
[1:32:32] stand behind it
[1:32:33] so when the lord says anything that does
[1:32:36] it
[1:32:37] so if you look what he's saying if if
[1:32:39] you're saying this dust says the lord
[1:32:41] and god didn't say it
[1:32:43] you're lying on god
[1:32:46] and that's what we've seen many things
[1:32:49] in the past
[1:32:50] and that's why god has allowed us to
[1:32:52] become prisoners
[1:32:55] of jesus christ to learn
[1:32:58] we don't say something unless he says it
[1:33:02] amen that's why that we must ask
[1:33:05] in his name because we are praying
[1:33:08] instead we're
[1:33:10] allowing the holy ghost to speak through
[1:33:12] us
[1:33:16] he said brother tim that's a tall order
[1:33:18] it's
[1:33:19] not too tall amen this is exactly what
[1:33:22] we're called to do in this hour
[1:33:25] going beyond the camp he would explain
[1:33:27] it this way he said knowing you're my
[1:33:29] responsibility and on my hands with the
[1:33:31] gospel
[1:33:32] i want to keep you right in the pages of
[1:33:34] this bible many times people come to me
[1:33:36] and say brother bradley
[1:33:37] if you just step out of here and say
[1:33:39] thus saith the lord to my
[1:33:40] child it's sick it'll be well and go out
[1:33:43] of here just say it'll get well that's
[1:33:45] all i want you to do
[1:33:46] he said now that's loyal and lovely and
[1:33:48] no doubt
[1:33:49] the person believes they're having faith
[1:33:55] but he says i can't do it until he
[1:33:59] tells me first i can pray for the child
[1:34:04] see that's what we're convinced to do
[1:34:05] lay hands on the sick
[1:34:07] they shall recover amen i can pray for
[1:34:11] the child
[1:34:11] to do all again but you see if i went
[1:34:13] out here under enthusiasm and said that
[1:34:15] if i said thus saith the lord
[1:34:17] it would really just be the same my
[1:34:19] enthusiasm
[1:34:21] and it does it might happen it might it
[1:34:23] might not happen
[1:34:24] and what if that same person under my
[1:34:26] enthusiasm and it didn't happen and then
[1:34:29] that person might be in a case sometimes
[1:34:31] between life and death
[1:34:32] where would their confidence be they
[1:34:34] would be afraid i was under
[1:34:36] enthusiasm again so when i
[1:34:40] say it i want to be dead earnest that
[1:34:42] it's right
[1:34:43] with all i know when he speaks to me i
[1:34:46] can just say
[1:34:47] what he showed me whether it's good or
[1:34:50] whether it's bad
[1:34:52] i have to say it if it's not pleasant to
[1:34:54] tell people
[1:34:55] the evil things that have befalled them
[1:34:57] as as i am my duty bound to tell them
[1:35:00] the good things that will
[1:35:01] follow them and after all we want the
[1:35:03] will of the lord
[1:35:05] sometimes the will of the lord is
[1:35:06] contrary to our desires
[1:35:08] but still if we want the will the lord
[1:35:10] is just as precious
[1:35:12] to know that the evil will befall us if
[1:35:15] it's the will of the lord
[1:35:16] whether it be good or evil if it's the
[1:35:18] will of the lord that we want it done
[1:35:20] and we want to look at it in that manner
[1:35:23] god whatever
[1:35:24] we want your own will this is where
[1:35:27] jesus
[1:35:28] came to he had a will and the father had
[1:35:32] a will
[1:35:35] now brother branham would say that jesus
[1:35:37] he wanted
[1:35:38] he maybe he wanted to have a family had
[1:35:41] natural desires to get married he
[1:35:43] had you know he had all of these human
[1:35:45] desires like
[1:35:46] human half but he would come to
[1:35:50] gethsemane
[1:35:51] and look at even at listen he would even
[1:35:54] look at the suffering that he would have
[1:35:56] to do
[1:35:57] and said lord if it be thy will
[1:36:00] let this cup pass from me he would even
[1:36:04] pray
[1:36:05] not to have to go through that
[1:36:10] but then he would surrender that wheel
[1:36:14] because without it we were the whole
[1:36:16] human race would be lost
[1:36:19] unless there was a man willing and he
[1:36:21] had to come to the point that
[1:36:22] he was willing
[1:36:26] and this is what it has to take with you
[1:36:28] you have to come to that point that
[1:36:30] you to your own gethsemane whether you
[1:36:32] are
[1:36:33] willing whatever god you want
[1:36:37] whatever you desire that's what i want
[1:36:39] in my life
[1:36:42] i surrender to it i yield to it
[1:36:46] i want it
[1:36:49] you see again this is
[1:36:53] very important because not only if paul
[1:36:57] learned to be a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:36:59] he learned to be a
[1:37:00] servant of jesus christ it meant not to
[1:37:03] speak anything until god told him to
[1:37:06] speak it now you know this is this is
[1:37:08] really something because
[1:37:10] you have peter and james and peter and
[1:37:13] john
[1:37:13] walk out to the gate called beautiful
[1:37:16] and it just looks spontaneous
[1:37:18] silver and gold that by none such as i
[1:37:20] have give out to thee
[1:37:22] you know they're they're working on a
[1:37:24] commission
[1:37:25] they're moving and as on a commission
[1:37:28] that god
[1:37:29] had committed them and then you have
[1:37:31] paul at the same time
[1:37:33] would be maybe a later date later time
[1:37:36] that paul
[1:37:37] would come along and and there would be
[1:37:39] a fortune teller
[1:37:41] begin to follow him and scream after him
[1:37:44] every day
[1:37:44] you know actually these are men of god
[1:37:47] they come to tell you the way of life
[1:37:49] and there was a fortune teller and it
[1:37:51] looked like the devil
[1:37:52] was given vindication to a servant of
[1:37:55] god
[1:37:59] and paul was vexed in his spirit
[1:38:04] but even though he's vexed he won't do
[1:38:07] nothing about it
[1:38:09] until god gives him the impulsive
[1:38:12] permission
[1:38:14] and then he turns to her in that time
[1:38:16] and commands that evil spirit to come
[1:38:18] out of here
[1:38:21] but he went for weeks with this
[1:38:24] happening
[1:38:26] because why he had learned to
[1:38:29] obey god he had to learn to wait on the
[1:38:32] holy spirit
[1:38:34] to move directed by the holy ghost
[1:38:37] now that's a again he was a servant of
[1:38:41] jesus christ
[1:38:42] and and he could not speak anything
[1:38:44] until god told him to speak it
[1:38:46] and then it took his faith to put into
[1:38:49] action
[1:38:50] what god told him to do there would be
[1:38:52] another that would be out there
[1:38:54] another young man that would be out
[1:38:56] there and and
[1:38:57] paul would look upon him and and he
[1:38:59] would discern that he had faith to be
[1:39:01] healed
[1:39:02] and would tell him to rise up and walk
[1:39:06] what was it he looked and he found that
[1:39:09] faith
[1:39:10] he found somebody believing from the
[1:39:12] heart
[1:39:16] now there again we must believe what the
[1:39:19] blood has made us
[1:39:22] we must believe we are the blood wash
[1:39:25] blood-bought sons and daughters of the
[1:39:28] living god
[1:39:29] amen amen we have been washed from our
[1:39:33] sins
[1:39:34] amen that the sins we used to do we do
[1:39:37] them no more
[1:39:38] that we're free and because of that
[1:39:42] the chasm is even gone amen that we have
[1:39:45] a right
[1:39:46] and access to the throne of grace
[1:39:50] but you must approach that throne of
[1:39:52] grace by faith
[1:39:54] nothing else will assail you into that
[1:39:56] throne of grace
[1:39:58] you must believe from the heart you see
[1:40:00] there's a lot of hypocrisy jesus would
[1:40:03] deal with this
[1:40:04] he said well did isaiah prophesy of you
[1:40:06] hypocrites
[1:40:07] it's written these people they honor me
[1:40:09] with their lips
[1:40:10] but their heart is far from me
[1:40:16] they're saying one thing with their
[1:40:17] mouth
[1:40:19] but their heart
[1:40:22] and it doesn't do any good to speak to a
[1:40:24] mountain
[1:40:26] with your mouth if in your heart you're
[1:40:29] not believing it
[1:40:32] you've got to be convinced
[1:40:36] amen now you see it's whatever god can
[1:40:39] lead your soul to believe that's
[1:40:41] why it's so important to be led by the
[1:40:43] spirit
[1:40:45] that's why i'm talking about brother
[1:40:46] brad i'm even talking about binding the
[1:40:48] serpent
[1:40:49] it's going to require greater sincerity
[1:40:52] amen what is a greater dedication
[1:40:55] there a purging of your own soul
[1:40:59] so that you can come into the presence
[1:41:01] of god that
[1:41:02] the hindrances are gone
[1:41:06] amen i never present from the water from
[1:41:08] the rock he said it this way
[1:41:10] when we die our souls will go under the
[1:41:12] altar god whereas privileged see a few
[1:41:14] moments ago
[1:41:15] mornings ago you know in division where
[1:41:17] the bible speaks of our spirits will go
[1:41:19] to god
[1:41:20] who give it our bodies shall return to
[1:41:22] the dust of the earth
[1:41:23] but someday when where the scripture is
[1:41:26] fulfilled our spirits will be released
[1:41:28] from god
[1:41:29] we'll pick up the soul the soul to the
[1:41:31] body and the power
[1:41:32] that will raise us up is right in us now
[1:41:35] we are now in heavenly places
[1:41:38] we are right now in the power of the
[1:41:40] resurrection
[1:41:42] somebody with me he said if there wasn't
[1:41:44] a law to that sons and daughters of god
[1:41:47] would go out and create a world out
[1:41:49] there and go live a private life on it
[1:41:52] that's how much power lays within you
[1:41:54] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:41:56] you have the power in you to do it if
[1:41:58] you've got a shadow
[1:42:00] of the power of god in you you've got
[1:42:02] the power to do it
[1:42:03] god is omnipotent see what i mean that's
[1:42:06] the power
[1:42:07] and you will you can speak a world in
[1:42:09] existence
[1:42:10] and go and live on it hallelujah there
[1:42:13] you are that's the power
[1:42:15] that's in the church now but it's
[1:42:18] controlled by
[1:42:20] law
[1:42:24] amen now you you know
[1:42:27] you know what i'm talking about there
[1:42:29] are laws that you have to work by
[1:42:32] you could go out here there's a pond
[1:42:34] right down the road
[1:42:35] you could scream all you wanted to walk
[1:42:38] out here and scream all of you
[1:42:40] water from that pond come here water the
[1:42:42] lawn
[1:42:43] it won't do it but if you work according
[1:42:46] to the law of gravitation
[1:42:50] you can dig a trench and funnel that
[1:42:53] if you get the gravity and get the the
[1:42:55] elevation right
[1:42:56] you can bring it right into the yard and
[1:42:59] water the yard
[1:43:01] by working according to a law
[1:43:04] god's word works according to law and
[1:43:07] that law
[1:43:07] is a word of faith it's a law of faith
[1:43:11] jesus said
[1:43:12] all things are possible
[1:43:16] what to them that believe
[1:43:22] all things this is why he could look at
[1:43:25] this mountain and say
[1:43:27] it's possible to move this mountain
[1:43:32] because if god can lead your soul to it
[1:43:35] if you're not doubting your heart you
[1:43:38] will have
[1:43:39] whatsoever things you said
[1:43:43] are you with me now again
[1:43:46] again this is what it requires it
[1:43:48] requires finding that will of god that's
[1:43:50] what
[1:43:51] the power is in the church now but it's
[1:43:53] controlled by law
[1:43:54] and that law is not keeping a bunch of
[1:43:56] commandments
[1:43:57] it's a law of faith jesus said all
[1:44:01] things are possible than them that
[1:44:02] believe and if you can believe it
[1:44:04] well listen now whatever god will lead
[1:44:07] your soul to believe
[1:44:10] that's yours
[1:44:13] every place the souls of your foot can
[1:44:16] set up on by faith
[1:44:17] god gives it to you amen it's yours you
[1:44:22] possess
[1:44:22] it if you can find the key to this law
[1:44:26] of faith
[1:44:27] that opens it amen if you're a
[1:44:30] son of god if you're a daughter of god
[1:44:32] that never leaves you
[1:44:33] it's with you all the time but your
[1:44:36] faith gets away from it
[1:44:37] but it's still there in other words the
[1:44:39] power lays within the church
[1:44:43] amen but the key to assess it the faith
[1:44:46] that is needed
[1:44:49] gets away from it this is why he's
[1:44:52] preaching
[1:44:53] ever-present water from the rock it was
[1:44:55] always there when they were in their dry
[1:44:57] places it was there
[1:44:58] when they were in their hard times it
[1:45:00] was there
[1:45:01] come on when trouble was all around it
[1:45:03] was there the rock
[1:45:05] followed them and that rock was
[1:45:08] christ amen it was always within
[1:45:11] speaking distance think about that this
[1:45:14] morning our rock
[1:45:16] is always within speaking distance you
[1:45:19] don't have to strike it
[1:45:20] amen you don't have to take him back to
[1:45:22] calgary and him be wounded again for
[1:45:24] your transgressions
[1:45:26] amen but again let me tell you all you
[1:45:29] have to do
[1:45:30] is speak to the rock and the rock is
[1:45:33] nearby
[1:45:34] it's right there but it's just waiting
[1:45:36] for somebody with faith
[1:45:38] to speak to that rock you speak to it
[1:45:41] and that will come life-giving water
[1:45:44] now so again your faith gets away from
[1:45:47] it it's always there
[1:45:49] that healing that healing power that was
[1:45:52] in
[1:45:52] in in the meetings when you when you
[1:45:55] know that blind eyes was open you hear
[1:45:58] deaf and dumb talk and you hear the or
[1:46:00] you
[1:46:01] hear the cripples walking all the that
[1:46:04] power still
[1:46:05] lays in the church it's never left us
[1:46:10] but our faith gets away from it
[1:46:15] amen he said when you're saved god gives
[1:46:17] your faith
[1:46:19] your faith to rise above the muck of the
[1:46:21] earth
[1:46:23] your faith overcomes the things of the
[1:46:25] world this is what the bible said
[1:46:27] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:46:30] world even
[1:46:31] our faith is that right so what is your
[1:46:35] faith your faith is that act that god
[1:46:37] has done in you to make you a son of god
[1:46:41] amen you know your sins are gone
[1:46:44] you the faith comes i am born
[1:46:47] a son of god i am his responsibility
[1:46:51] therefore no longer will cigarettes have
[1:46:54] hold on me
[1:46:55] no longer an effeminate spirit or some
[1:46:57] evil spirit
[1:46:58] have hold on me i'm a son of god i'm a
[1:47:02] daughter of god
[1:47:03] i can walk right i can i can overcome
[1:47:06] this
[1:47:06] i can win this battle because i am a
[1:47:10] child of the most high god
[1:47:13] amen you're lying you're cheating you're
[1:47:16] stealing you quit
[1:47:17] drinking because your faith rises you
[1:47:19] above it
[1:47:20] amen if you don't do it you don't have
[1:47:22] any faith because by faith are you saved
[1:47:25] into grace as much as your faith
[1:47:27] will be released that's how much power
[1:47:30] you can have
[1:47:32] amen that's why brother branham would
[1:47:34] say don't just be satisfied with little
[1:47:36] things
[1:47:37] he said believe for big things he big
[1:47:40] things is just as easy to come as little
[1:47:42] things
[1:47:44] he says you know he said as much of your
[1:47:46] faith and be released
[1:47:47] that's how much power you can have
[1:47:49] because in you
[1:47:50] dwells the power to make heavens and
[1:47:54] earth
[1:47:55] god dwells in you your sons and
[1:47:57] daughters of god
[1:47:59] there you are but it's your faith
[1:48:00] according to your faith
[1:48:02] be it unto you amen if falcons believe
[1:48:06] all things are possible if you say this
[1:48:09] mountain be moved
[1:48:10] and don't doubt but believe what you
[1:48:12] said
[1:48:13] you see then what kind of people he said
[1:48:15] are we to be
[1:48:16] having faith in this redeeming christ
[1:48:20] that lives in us
[1:48:23] this smitten rock that never leaves the
[1:48:25] church
[1:48:26] i'm with you always to the end of the
[1:48:28] world that ever present
[1:48:30] of the great gutter of salvation and
[1:48:32] power that poured forth from calvary
[1:48:35] into the church the ever presence of
[1:48:37] this living god
[1:48:38] great flowing smitten rock that goes
[1:48:41] with us in our journey
[1:48:44] so so you see again it's our it's not
[1:48:47] that god don't do that
[1:48:48] it's that our faith gets away from it
[1:48:52] but where do we come back to that faith
[1:48:54] it comes back when we come back
[1:48:56] to sincerity and honesty
[1:49:00] amen when we come to god with all of our
[1:49:02] heart when we
[1:49:03] when we seek him with all our soul
[1:49:05] that's when
[1:49:06] faith comes in there to take that word
[1:49:09] and believe that word
[1:49:11] amen as brother braven said and the word
[1:49:13] became flesh
[1:49:15] he said and they are sons of god are led
[1:49:18] by the spirit of god
[1:49:20] then when the human element goes out and
[1:49:23] the spirit of god fills that vacancy
[1:49:26] where you empty yourself then when the
[1:49:28] will be that's when the church
[1:49:30] in its power the resurrection of the
[1:49:32] lord jesus
[1:49:33] will walk in his steps in his power in
[1:49:36] his thoughts
[1:49:36] in his being in his moving you see what
[1:49:39] i mean then your thoughts
[1:49:41] will become words and your words
[1:49:44] will become material that's when the
[1:49:47] church
[1:49:48] is in its power when is when the human
[1:49:50] element
[1:49:52] is pushed out
[1:49:57] i believe that it's on this road that
[1:50:00] when the church will be so
[1:50:02] wrapped in christ the holy spirit
[1:50:04] mankind's so far away from themselves
[1:50:08] till they won't see themselves they
[1:50:10] don't have any
[1:50:11] but to serve god and their um thoughts
[1:50:14] move on they refuse the things of the
[1:50:17] world they just
[1:50:18] move in the spirit live in the spirit
[1:50:20] move in the spirit
[1:50:21] walk in the spirit so fulfill the life
[1:50:23] the law of christ
[1:50:24] and then when the love of christ is in
[1:50:26] the human heart moving in the holy ghost
[1:50:29] that great wonderful church will go
[1:50:31] forth with power and deity
[1:50:33] because deity will be revealed in human
[1:50:36] beings
[1:50:36] by the holy spirit bring in the past the
[1:50:39] thought of
[1:50:40] their mind amen now
[1:50:43] wasn't that exactly what happened there
[1:50:45] when the third pool worked for brother
[1:50:47] branham
[1:50:48] it was god gave him the thoughts and he
[1:50:51] took those
[1:50:52] thoughts and they became words and those
[1:50:54] words
[1:50:55] became creative
[1:50:58] now you know if we can only get to the
[1:51:01] place
[1:51:02] where we pray like he told us to do
[1:51:06] ask anything in my name
[1:51:10] in other words be the mouthpiece of god
[1:51:15] where you're acting instead with him
[1:51:18] using your voice
[1:51:22] notice this he said in fundamental
[1:51:26] foundation
[1:51:26] of of faith he says jesus said whatever
[1:51:30] you ask the father my name that i will
[1:51:32] do do you know what that means
[1:51:35] do you realize if we go before god in
[1:51:38] the name of jesus
[1:51:41] it's just the same as jesus himself
[1:51:44] praying it isn't me praying anymore if i
[1:51:48] come in his name
[1:51:49] and he recognizes his name and jesus
[1:51:51] said whatever you ask the father in my
[1:51:53] name
[1:51:53] that i will do and then i go to the
[1:51:55] father in jesus name
[1:51:57] it isn't me praying anymore it's jesus
[1:52:01] it's a spirit praying through me
[1:52:05] now you see what it means to ask
[1:52:07] anything
[1:52:08] in his name because you're acting in his
[1:52:11] stead you found that will of god you
[1:52:14] found that
[1:52:14] vein of anointing and if you it's not
[1:52:18] just a carter blanket
[1:52:19] and you just go out here and at any whim
[1:52:21] just ask anything you want and i'll do
[1:52:23] it
[1:52:24] no but when you ask in my name
[1:52:28] now he said the
[1:52:32] son of god spent so much time in prayer
[1:52:36] and if jesus had to spend much time in
[1:52:38] prayer to stay in
[1:52:39] fellowship with the spirit that was
[1:52:43] in him how much more do you and i
[1:52:46] have to spend in prayer
[1:52:50] now wait a minute you've got the holy
[1:52:53] ghost he's
[1:52:53] living on the inside of you you're born
[1:52:56] again but you got this outside man
[1:52:59] that's a human got a human spirit and
[1:53:03] he's got a human will
[1:53:04] and he's got human desires human things
[1:53:07] he wants done
[1:53:10] amen but oh if
[1:53:13] the human will get in
[1:53:16] fellowship with the holy spirit that's
[1:53:20] inside of him
[1:53:24] where he can be directed by
[1:53:27] the spirit instead of directed by
[1:53:31] human desires you see this is where
[1:53:34] it takes spending much time in prayer it
[1:53:37] takes that
[1:53:38] consecration and that dedicated walk
[1:53:41] amen to what to be in fellowship
[1:53:45] with the spirit that's on the inside of
[1:53:49] you
[1:53:52] where you're asking from the heart
[1:53:56] where you're asking from the holy spirit
[1:53:58] on this
[1:53:59] when is him using your lips
[1:54:02] when it's him using your voice
[1:54:07] come on your generation that saw that
[1:54:09] happen
[1:54:10] you saw a man stand there and god used
[1:54:13] his vocal cords
[1:54:16] you saw a man stand there and god
[1:54:19] move in that man's body use his vocal
[1:54:22] cord
[1:54:22] use his voice box and speak things that
[1:54:25] no man could know
[1:54:27] only god can know it was god using
[1:54:30] a man god wants to use you
[1:54:36] amen he wants to use you in whatever
[1:54:38] capacity he's called you to
[1:54:40] to move in it may be to say something
[1:54:43] your son
[1:54:44] say something to your daughter amen
[1:54:47] believing that you can go with token
[1:54:49] life
[1:54:50] the holy ghost on the inside of you and
[1:54:52] knowing your words are created
[1:54:54] when you're anointed by the holy ghost
[1:54:56] and talk to that son
[1:54:57] or talk to that daughter and see the
[1:54:59] whole atmosphere change
[1:55:01] and such a love of christ that they just
[1:55:04] fall right into it
[1:55:10] it can happen it is to happen
[1:55:13] that's the way that it happens
[1:55:17] you see you remember when
[1:55:20] you've got a part in this you see
[1:55:23] because
[1:55:23] he's not going to come down from heaven
[1:55:25] with his voice
[1:55:27] he's going to use you in your voice
[1:55:31] it'll be your voice winning the loss
[1:55:34] it'll be your voice he will use to heal
[1:55:37] the sick.
[1:55:40] come on amen remember you've got a part
[1:55:43] in this
[1:55:44] he would say he'd look out on the he's
[1:55:47] the lord of the harvest he'll look out
[1:55:48] on the harvest
[1:55:49] and he says it's white it's ready for
[1:55:52] harvest
[1:55:55] amen and he said the laborers are few
[1:55:58] but then he said pray you to the lord of
[1:56:01] the harvest
[1:56:04] that he'll send laborers into the
[1:56:07] harvest
[1:56:08] in other words pray to me
[1:56:13] you asked me to do what i want
[1:56:16] done on the earth
[1:56:23] amen you begin to call on me
[1:56:26] to send laborers look i want the work
[1:56:29] done
[1:56:30] amen there's laborers of you i can tell
[1:56:32] you laborers of you but it's going to
[1:56:34] take you
[1:56:35] to call on me
[1:56:38] because there's something you've got in
[1:56:41] this too
[1:56:43] you see he made you kings and priests
[1:56:46] and in doing so
[1:56:47] you have a dominion and a domain but you
[1:56:50] also
[1:56:51] are under him and you must know what he
[1:56:54] wants done with the word
[1:56:58] so he would say you've got a part in
[1:57:01] this
[1:57:03] you see we get the point we want god to
[1:57:06] do everything
[1:57:07] we just want it to happen spontaneous
[1:57:10] and there's no surrender
[1:57:12] and there's no dedication and there's no
[1:57:15] consecration
[1:57:16] and we're just walking life like you
[1:57:19] know like usual
[1:57:24] and the angels are trying to anoint you
[1:57:28] but the prince of persia is a is
[1:57:31] opposing him
[1:57:35] and you can see in the books
[1:57:39] that the coming of the lord is near amen
[1:57:43] that the death angel
[1:57:44] is about to ride in the land that is
[1:57:46] changing from the black to the pale
[1:57:49] and that the bride's got to get out of
[1:57:50] here and you can read in the books
[1:57:54] where the last messengers come and we're
[1:57:56] now in the we're now in overtime
[1:57:58] somebody help me preach that we're right
[1:58:00] here in the last days
[1:58:02] in the last of the last of the last days
[1:58:06] is somebody with me and we're right here
[1:58:08] on the very cusp on the
[1:58:09] brink of full redemption but it's going
[1:58:12] to take
[1:58:12] somebody that is agonizing with god to
[1:58:15] fulfill his word
[1:58:21] that keeps pressing through
[1:58:24] remember because as you press through so
[1:58:27] does the angel press
[1:58:31] you see as you press he presses
[1:58:34] as you back up he backs off
[1:58:40] so if you want the angel to get through
[1:58:43] to you for your unanswered prayer
[1:58:46] come on you got to keep pressing
[1:58:50] amen listen the bible said that that
[1:58:53] this requires
[1:58:54] force amen and that we must
[1:58:57] press our way into it it's an age you
[1:59:01] say brother tim a lot of pressure
[1:59:02] a lot of press but you've got to press
[1:59:06] amen i just want to ask you is the world
[1:59:08] filling your press
[1:59:11] is the satanic forces feeling your press
[1:59:14] you're pushing back you shove it back
[1:59:18] no you're not going to take my son no
[1:59:20] you're not taking my daughter
[1:59:22] no you're not going to cause a sickness
[1:59:24] to take this life
[1:59:25] no you're not going to do this i'm a son
[1:59:28] of god and we're pressing
[1:59:30] we're pressing we're going to find that
[1:59:33] wheel we're going to
[1:59:34] find that purpose we're going to hear
[1:59:36] from the angel we're going to be
[1:59:38] anointed
[1:59:39] to overthrow you the angel will come
[1:59:42] with the answer
[1:59:47] part of it lays in human beings the
[1:59:49] kingdom of god
[1:59:51] lays in the human being i'm the vine
[1:59:54] jesus said you're the branches
[1:59:55] the blind doesn't bear the fruit the
[1:59:57] branches bear the fruit
[1:59:59] it's time you become fruit barren
[2:00:02] god looked up there and looked at a fig
[2:00:04] tree jesus did and it had no fruit
[2:00:07] and then he cursed it he looks at the
[2:00:10] there is a vine he said anything that
[2:00:12] don't bear fruit is cut off
[2:00:14] and thrown into the fire amen god that
[2:00:17] doesn't like it when the church doesn't
[2:00:19] bear fruit
[2:00:21] amen god wants your hands god wants your
[2:00:25] eyes
[2:00:26] he wants your tongue he wants your lips
[2:00:28] he wants your ears he wants your hands
[2:00:30] he wants your feet
[2:00:31] in other words you're going to be the
[2:00:33] body that he walks through
[2:00:36] i mean he would say sacrifices and
[2:00:38] offerings i would was not but a body
[2:00:40] has not prepared me this is what he
[2:00:42] would say of jesus
[2:00:44] that jesus would be the body prepared i
[2:00:46] don't want just sacrifices and offerings
[2:00:48] and even when it comes down god don't
[2:00:50] want just empty worship
[2:00:52] he wants a body prepared
[2:00:56] he said there he said oh that you
[2:00:59] could could uh submit your body not to
[2:01:02] be
[2:01:03] conformed to the world but to be
[2:01:04] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[2:01:08] where you actually look at things the
[2:01:09] way god looks at them
[2:01:13] your mind renewed i don't know about you
[2:01:16] but i want to be the hands and feet of
[2:01:18] his spirit upon the earth
[2:01:21] amen now he said
[2:01:24] jesus spent much time in prayer one day
[2:01:27] he told his disciples cross over to the
[2:01:29] other side
[2:01:30] sent them away while he went to the
[2:01:32] mountain to pray
[2:01:34] while he was up there alone it was a
[2:01:36] storm came
[2:01:39] brother branham looked at that situation
[2:01:40] he said you know i believe
[2:01:42] if either been thy disciple said i know
[2:01:44] he told us to go over
[2:01:46] but i just believe i'll wait until he
[2:01:49] comes
[2:01:50] and goes along with us i ain't going
[2:01:53] without him
[2:01:55] amen this is where we get in trouble
[2:01:57] this is where the church
[2:01:58] has gotten trouble too many have gone
[2:02:01] off without him too many have claimed
[2:02:04] the message
[2:02:06] and never got him amen that's why we see
[2:02:10] all the fallen away and the things that
[2:02:12] are happening and
[2:02:13] and and the travesties in the church is
[2:02:16] because
[2:02:17] they went off without him amen but
[2:02:20] listen
[2:02:21] you know again if you start going off
[2:02:24] without him and we remember we can take
[2:02:27] him with us

[2:02:31] to abide he
[2:02:32] lives in us we don't go anywhere he
[2:02:35] don't go
[2:02:37] amen if he goes we're going amen
[2:02:41] like ruth said to uh said to naomi

[2:02:49] your people will be my people your god
[2:02:51] will be my god
[2:02:52] she was determined she made up her mind
[2:02:55] that's the way it's got to be with
[2:02:56] believers
[2:02:57] i am determined ah if you go this way
[2:03:00] i'm going with you
[2:03:01] it's like a lasher on the trail of
[2:03:03] elijah when he wanted that double
[2:03:05] portion
[2:03:06] you see me when i go away you'll get it

[2:03:32] and it's about him i'm not leaving the
[2:03:34] word i'm not leaving the anointing
[2:03:36] i'm following that everywhere he goes
[2:03:39] that's where i'm going
[2:03:40] whatever he says that's what i say
[2:03:42] [Applause]
[2:03:45] amen because why because soon as the
[2:03:47] devil sees you out of fellowship with
[2:03:49] christ
[2:03:50] he'll sit right on for you amen
[2:03:53] when he sees you away from prayer away
[2:03:55] from consecration
[2:03:56] satan will catch you right there if you
[2:03:58] possibly can
[2:04:00] see what is it god wants to get a people
[2:04:03] his prisoner that's what he's been doing
[2:04:05] all of these years
[2:04:07] this has not been for nothing remember
[2:04:09] we've had this time for a purpose
[2:04:12] where that we can become a prisoner
[2:04:14] where you can't
[2:04:15] look at what somebody else's think you
[2:04:18] know you got to just
[2:04:19] do what he says do you're a prisoner
[2:04:22] is that right paul pressed in the spirit
[2:04:26] you know to to go in a place where he
[2:04:28] didn't uh
[2:04:30] or or was forbidden by the spirit you
[2:04:32] know one time he wanted to go a certain
[2:04:34] place and
[2:04:35] and he was forbidden by the spirit to go
[2:04:37] there he turns and
[2:04:38] goes into macedonia and follows the
[2:04:41] macedonian call what was it
[2:04:43] it was the leadership of the holy ghost
[2:04:45] not just going random where he wanted to
[2:04:48] but led by the spirit oh and he said oh
[2:04:51] if the church could be
[2:04:53] so is so in the glorious presence of god
[2:04:56] that someday god will turn loose his
[2:04:59] power into it
[2:05:00] things will take place but you can't mix
[2:05:03] your diet you'll become
[2:05:04] hybrid stay exactly with what god said
[2:05:07] stay with the word
[2:05:09] amen you hear brother branham saying and
[2:05:11] who do you say this
[2:05:12] is you show me a church who's ever
[2:05:15] moving action it's dust saved the lord
[2:05:17] and walking in that kind of glory i'll
[2:05:19] show you a messiah
[2:05:21] standing on the earth an anointed one of
[2:05:23] god
[2:05:24] amen now
[2:05:28] if thou canst believe
[2:05:32] all things are possible if that
[2:05:35] believeth from the heart
[2:05:38] notice there was a man who came to the
[2:05:41] disciples
[2:05:43] he had a need but somewhere there was
[2:05:46] some unbelief
[2:05:48] maybe you heard all of the about the
[2:05:50] fanaticism of jesus and his disciples
[2:05:54] all the miracles aren't really true
[2:05:56] they're not really right he brings them
[2:05:58] to his disciples and you know his
[2:06:00] disciples do every kind of things and
[2:06:02] they stomp and scream and yell and
[2:06:04] anoint and
[2:06:05] and my made a pretty big fool of
[2:06:08] themselves
[2:06:10] the devil wouldn't leave the boy you
[2:06:13] remember
[2:06:15] and he comes to jesus and i want you to
[2:06:18] notice
[2:06:19] he comes with that same doubt
[2:06:24] because he says i brought my my child to
[2:06:27] your disciples
[2:06:29] and they couldn't cure him
[2:06:34] and jesus laid it right on to him he
[2:06:36] said it's a lack of faith
[2:06:40] and he said to jesus if
[2:06:44] thou can do anything
[2:06:48] heal my son
[2:06:53] and jesus turns it around right back on
[2:06:56] him
[2:06:58] it's not if i can do it
[2:07:02] he said all things impossible if i can
[2:07:06] find faith if
[2:07:07] somebody believes if you believe it from
[2:07:11] your heart
[2:07:14] and the man knowing he had a belief
[2:07:17] he didn't he didn't fight it he didn't
[2:07:20] deny it
[2:07:21] he said but yet he began to make a
[2:07:24] different profession
[2:07:26] he said lord i believe
[2:07:29] help thou my unbelief in other words
[2:07:31] forgive me
[2:07:33] for disbelieving
[2:07:35] [Applause]
[2:07:37] and that's what we got to do when we
[2:07:39] look at the promise of god we got to
[2:07:41] look at it and say
[2:07:42] lord we we got all of these obstacles
[2:07:44] and
[2:07:45] yeah we're dealing with unbelief and
[2:07:47] more unbelief than ever in this age
[2:07:49] lord i i'm encumbered with unbelief and
[2:07:52] it floods in and
[2:07:53] doubt holds me back and keeps me
[2:07:56] lord but i believe forgive me
[2:08:00] of my unbelief
[2:08:05] and at that moment the man was healed
[2:08:08] his mountain was moved amen
[2:08:13] you see it's when the heart believes
[2:08:16] romans 6 17 but god be thinks
[2:08:20] that you were the servants of sin
[2:08:24] but you have obeyed how
[2:08:27] from the heart there be people sometimes
[2:08:31] obey for the sake of obedience
[2:08:36] or for the sake of fitting in
[2:08:39] this is what god requires this is what i
[2:08:41] got to do
[2:08:42] but when you obey from the heart that
[2:08:45] form of doctrine which was delivered to
[2:08:47] you
[2:08:48] being that made free from sin you became
[2:08:51] servants of righteousness
[2:08:55] amen what when you believed from the
[2:08:57] heart
[2:08:59] am i not when you just believe that's
[2:09:01] mental
[2:09:02] oh yeah i believe that god can do that
[2:09:04] but no you know god will do it for me
[2:09:07] you believe from the heart that form a
[2:09:10] doctrine
[2:09:11] which was delivered to you being that
[2:09:14] made free from sin you became servants
[2:09:16] of righteousness
[2:09:17] romans 10 6 but the righteousness
[2:09:20] which is of faith speaketh on this wise
[2:09:24] say not in thine heart what's now where
[2:09:27] it's at
[2:09:27] don't say in your heart who shall ascend
[2:09:30] to heaven
[2:09:31] that is to bring christ down from above
[2:09:34] or who shall ascend to the deep that is
[2:09:36] to bring him again from the dead
[2:09:39] but what saith what saith the heart
[2:09:43] what is it what does the what does the
[2:09:46] heart
[2:09:46] of righteousness say it says the word is
[2:09:50] nighting the word's right here
[2:09:53] it's even in the mouth and in the heart
[2:09:56] that is the word of faith which we
[2:09:58] preach that if i will confess
[2:10:00] with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall
[2:10:02] believe
[2:10:03] where in thine heart that god has raised
[2:10:06] him from the dead
[2:10:08] thou shalt be saved amen for with the
[2:10:11] heart
[2:10:12] man believeth unto righteousness and
[2:10:14] with the mouth
[2:10:15] confession is made to salvation for the
[2:10:18] scripture
[2:10:19] said whosoever believeth on him shall
[2:10:22] not be ashamed
[2:10:24] you see you know where we are
[2:10:28] we're in a day where god's calling for
[2:10:30] greater faith
[2:10:34] this is the hour of rapture in faith
[2:10:39] faith for a god's
[2:10:42] demanding a greater faith
[2:10:45] and when we see things moving like they
[2:10:48] are doing it should
[2:10:50] anoint our faith and
[2:10:53] when we see things that are moving right
[2:10:55] into the vision right into the prophecy
[2:10:58] of god's word
[2:10:59] it should anoint our faith even more to
[2:11:02] believe
[2:11:02] from the heart amen you know
[2:11:06] you remember uh you remember brother
[2:11:08] branham's vision
[2:11:10] of seeing the silver tip grizzly bear
[2:11:13] and
[2:11:13] brother eddie bisco uh you know he
[2:11:16] didn't
[2:11:16] know who it was in the vision but a
[2:11:18] young man in a green checkered shirt
[2:11:21] and and he would see this bear right
[2:11:23] after
[2:11:24] he had killed a caribou with 42 inch
[2:11:29] horns by the way brother aaron was just
[2:11:31] recently
[2:11:32] might be able to share some of that
[2:11:34] maybe wednesday night
[2:11:36] but he was he was recently there in the
[2:11:39] den
[2:11:40] they just rescored that caribou again
[2:11:43] and and it was rescored on both sides
[2:11:47] both sides symmetrically the same
[2:11:50] 42 inches
[2:11:53] after all of these years
[2:11:58] the miracle continues
[2:12:02] are you with me amen and so he
[2:12:05] he would he would after killing this
[2:12:07] this
[2:12:08] caribou which you know was not common to
[2:12:11] the country
[2:12:12] and and also the silver tip had never
[2:12:15] been seen one in that area before by the
[2:12:17] guide
[2:12:18] and most of the caribou were panel horns
[2:12:21] and this was like
[2:12:21] spike horns and you know that that were
[2:12:24] coming up
[2:12:25] and and he saw him kill it and and then
[2:12:28] it would be measured it would be 42
[2:12:30] inches
[2:12:31] when they got back to the camp where
[2:12:33] before they got back to camp
[2:12:35] that would be he would see a young man
[2:12:38] with a
[2:12:39] green checkered shirt and he would see
[2:12:42] their um uh then a silver tip
[2:12:46] grizzly and he would get so close to it
[2:12:49] and
[2:12:49] shoot it you know you remember the story
[2:12:51] of it
[2:12:53] and and as he's going up there
[2:12:56] and he sees there and he shoots the
[2:12:59] animal
[2:13:00] and he looks back and he sees
[2:13:03] down back uh behind him way back
[2:13:07] around on the backside big wide open
[2:13:10] area
[2:13:11] and he could see way down there a young
[2:13:13] man with a checkered shirt
[2:13:16] now this boy brother eddie biskell
[2:13:20] they'd already asked does anybody have
[2:13:22] that shirt
[2:13:24] they knew it was required you know some
[2:13:27] things
[2:13:28] has to be put in the right place
[2:13:31] and you can't put it there
[2:13:36] god has to put it there and you have to
[2:13:38] wait till things get
[2:13:40] exactly right in the right place
[2:13:44] i'm telling you we're now at a time
[2:13:46] where it's closer than ever
[2:13:49] are you with me things are coming right
[2:13:52] into place

[2:13:56] know the the green shirt that
[2:13:58] eddie had denied having you remember the
[2:14:01] story

[2:14:04] and an older shirt and he
[2:14:05] didn't want to take it with me get me
[2:14:07] some new shirts and his wife got him new
[2:14:09] shirts and repaired that one
[2:14:10] and just stuck it down in for an extra
[2:14:13] and he'd fall into the water
[2:14:15] and he got that shirt and he put it on
[2:14:17] you know a dry shirt
[2:14:19] he's not even thinking and i'm telling
[2:14:22] you friends we're right here in the
[2:14:23] vision right now
[2:14:27] and we're walking it maybe you don't
[2:14:29] even realize
[2:14:31] that you've done been seen in that
[2:14:33] vision but here you
[2:14:35] are and you're walking right in it
[2:14:38] things are happening right around you
[2:14:41] and you're oblivious to it
[2:14:45] but god's not going to leave you out
[2:14:48] you're part of the vision
[2:14:51] are you with me amen he's not leaving
[2:14:54] listen he's not going to lose a one of

[2:15:02] blind and lame
[2:15:04] in every kind of horrible condition are

[2:15:09] because he said they're going to sit at
[2:15:10] my table
[2:15:12] my table will be full i will have a
[2:15:15] bride she will be without spot or
[2:15:20] wrinkle

[2:15:28] checkered shirt but we can see for miles
[2:15:31] and i don't see
