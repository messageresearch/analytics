service to you i give myself to you ask for your anointing now that you'll just break every yoke of sin and unbelief in jesus name amen amen god bless you amen you will turn with me in your bible to revelation chapter 12. we're going to read from there this morning trusting the lord will just speak to you and illuminate his word to you amen revelation chapter 12 and verse 1 and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pain to be delivered and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his head and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast him to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and so she brought forth a man-child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up to god and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she has a place prepared of god that they should feed her their a thousand two hundred and three score days and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren his counts down which accused them before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice your heavens and ye that dwell in them woe unto the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down to you because he knoweth he hath but a short time and when the dragon saw that he was cast into the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man-child and the woman were given to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time and times and a half time from the face of the serpent and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood and the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus christ amen may god bless you you can be seated we're going to be speaking this morning on the battle for preeminence as you know i spoke of a dream that i had here lately were that i was preparing for meetings and um there i as i laid out things to take i had laid out a weapon that was just that just fit me and i was going to load load it and prepare with a couple of things that from what brother branham taught on christ is a mystery of god revealed and another was on um the you know god in his universe god and his son god and his people and so you know as i tied those two sermons together and those two thoughts together in this dream and was preparing for the meeting it has provoked me and caused me to study those sermons and just to look into the depth as i remember brother brad i'm talking about in christ the mystery of god revealed he said if you miss it come back to this tape and uh so you know we we always want to go back and look and make sure that we're um in steady in the faith that we know where what we're talking about if you haven't listened to those sermons of lately i think it'd be a good thing for you to do is to go back over those things again now um but in there brother bradham had a lot to say about preeminence and because this is one thing that he would do with with god would reveal himself in christ and then he would uh in order to redeem a people and then he would get preeminence in that people and once he got preeminence he would take them back to eden and so this was the threefold purpose of god what that god had in his mind as as brother branham would say it in the back part of his mind before the foundational world and we're in a an hour in a time where that which was hidden mysteries that were awaited for the end time we can now look back and see the whole plan of god revealed and and of course this is what god has done for us by sending a message in this last day and i want to say that i'm so thankful for the seventh angel and the sounding of that message amen because it it was a message as elijah was to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers now um so when we're speaking about this battle for preeminence let's just talk about this for a moment because in the beginning god's word had the preeminence and apparently in the end god's word will again have preeminence in a people and so in the beginning his word had preeminence over all the earth and the heavens were made by the word of god and the earth was ruled by the word of god adam would control the atmospheres of the garden and and dress the garden by the power of the word but we know then we we know that in before the beginning of the earth or before the inhabitants of the earth that there was a battle and that battle started in the heavens we can see in revelation 12 that that the battle is also in the heavens so there is a disturbance that is going on in the heavenly realms as um as there is a bride that is about to take her position there and as she goes to take her position of course there is a fierce and furious battle that takes place between um michael the archangel and and lucifer and um so this but this battle has been a long uh ongoing battle and there have been many many wars and skirmishes that have been fought and um and so yet we're here in the time where there's going to be an end to this battle amen where that there there will be a a total victory and a total deliverance and um so the battle it started on heaven it continued upon the earth because the bible said that his tale drew the third part of the stars of heaven and it cast him the earth now brother branham did a play of words on this in one of his sermons he said it wasn't so much his tale but you know the t-a-i-l but but the t-a-l-e that he told and and it was the lie of the devil that caused the fall of angels and then it would cause the fall of man now so he would by the la the the the lie deceive angels and by the lie he would also deceive man now paul tells us of his ambition and and that satan will accomplish a large part of his ambition if you look with me in ii thessalonians 2 and verse 3 and they were questioning paul about the day of the lord and about the coming of the lord and and so he told them he said now let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there cometh falling away first so he said there's even to come a falling away and and he said then that man of sin will be revealed the son of perdition now now don't just think of a falling away at the end time we we see that there has been a fallen away ever since the first age and so there there has been a falling away until the woman that began there in the book of acts winds up being the of the book of revelation so you you can see that um there was a fall in the way the church continued to fall until out there that she was irredeemable and god would have to call out a people out of every kindred tongue and tribe and nation he would actually by his word have to create himself a bride now so he said um in verse four he said he opposes and exalted his heaven but what's these words he exalts his self above all that is called god or or that is worshipped and and so that he sitteth as he as god sitteth in the temple of god now he's not doing this as satan notice he is doing this masquerading himself as god sitting in the temple of god and he is trying to prove or show or convincing others that he indeed is god so you see it's a great deception that the world ends in a time of an age of terrible terrible deception where satan himself sits in the very church of god and convinces people that he is god and and so he is worshiped and he does this by opposing and exalting so if you notice this word opposing it it is a is a battle that is going on and and and his whole purpose is to exalt himself now he says i will be worshiped in other words i will have preeminence so the the battle between god and satan is over who will have preeminence and i want you to notice that god also says he will have preeminence in colossians 1 and verse 18 and he christ is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence so you have two now that are saying two opposing forces that are desiring preeminence amen now what caused the fall of lucifer in heaven satan desired to have preeminence over angels and and then of course he fell and the angels that that he deceived were cast out with him and he come to earth to gain them preeminence over the sons of god and he wanted lordship over man and thus have lordship over the earth now remember everyone unless unless you are born again by the holy spirit of god satan has lordship over you amen there are two lords satan is the lord of some and that and jesus christ is the lord of others there's your true two lords amen but the born again jesus christ is lord he is a ruler he has supremacy he has preeminence for the unborn again satan has preeminence now so what was of all of of that happened in the garden it was when the lie of the devil the word of satan was taken and given preeminence over god's word which gave satan lordship now so satan came to the weaker vessel which was eve and eve chose to give the word of the serpent preeminence over the word of god now this is this is what happened in the garden and of course this is a very type of what happens to the church as you see in ii thessalonians that that the church gives preeminence to satan and he sits there in the temple of god worshiped as god now so now we know what happened satan used a serpent to get headship or preeminence over eve and by doing so he got headship over adam and he took position over the sons of god now preeminence preeminence you know is something that's very important in the marriage vow we pledge to forsake all others is that right and be true to our mate until death do us part and so that means your spouse is to have preeminence over any other person or be first place in your life of course with god being preeminent overall but now the woman typing the bride is to be subject to her husband and of course the husband is to be subject to christ now but because of sin now when because of what the fall in the garden all of us were born wrong we have to be born again and we that's this is why jesus first doctrine came he said you might be an israelite you might be natural seed of abraham but you gotta have a new birth you were born wrong no matter what race you come in no matter how chosen a race you got to be born again you must be born again and now because of sin we were born dead to god and we were alive to sin now see if you look with me on ephesians 2 and 1 and it says and you as he quickened so he made us alive because we were dead in trespasses and sin we were born dead we required to be birthed into another life and that's the only way that that that new life can ever become known to you is by a new birth a personal experience with god himself where in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air now notice satan has power in the atmospheres he the atmosphere of your life then would become darkened and clouded with unbelief within and it would permeate your nature and you would walk according to the course of this world because you know because of the spirit that now worketh in the children of the disobedience now among whom we all add our conversation that means our conduct in times past in the lust of our flesh notice we we all we all were born this way there was none of us born sinless we everyone needed redeemed we were everyone born in sin shape and iniquity as brother branham would jam these scriptures together and come in this world speaking lies this was our condition this was where we are amen now so therefore we all had our times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of our flesh and of the mind and where by nature by the atmospheres that ruled over us and that that atmosphere made us who we were and that we were the children of wrath even as others amen this is who we were by our first birth this is what sin birthed us into but god aren't you glad for that but god who is rich in mercy for his love wherewith he loved us remember we were his first this is very important we were his first he had a claim on us first we were in his book first amen we belong to him first we never originally belonged to the devil so he came looking for his own because his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins not by our own choice but by our birth into sinful life but he has made us alive now or quickened us or brought us into another realm or atmosphere a man of heaven's atmosphere and raised us up or made us alive together with christ by grace are you saved and that raises up together or gave us entrance into and made us to sit together to rule in heavenly places in christ jesus so here is the believer's position he is to rule with christ whatever she defeated you're to rule over that defeated thing amen sin was defeated sickness was defeated even death was defeated yes all right so his grace gives us a seed of dominion enthroned with christ over the desires and the lust of the flesh and the mind changing our atmospheres of our being from sin with its doubt and with its unbelief now now we're we're here in this end time and we see the patterns down to the ages and we come down and we we can look back and we can type ourselves and see us back in the bible and see israel god would use her as a type and and he would reflect himself through all of these characters down to the bible and we come to the end time and you know right at the same time that an angel of god maybe not on the same day maybe not exactly the same years but whenever it was however it was in the same age right about the same time are you with me you have the the rise of powers united nations coming forth world council and churches are coming forth right all of these are are coming forth with power and then right in there an angel comes to profit amen right at the same time that he is revealing himself to a prophet he you know israel is raising up and people are gathered back to their homeland what is it it's reflecting something that is happening in the in the realm of the world there's a turmoil that is going on there's a uniting of time and signs there's uniting of people together some against god's word some to fulfill god's word and so there's a whole battle that sets it away as good versus evil comes together and and the fight is begins to happen in the spiritual realm and and and so it it comes and it manifests itself also in the physical realm now notice as we see this israel is always a type of the the church of the bride she is always a type of her but she is a physical entity where the bride is a spiritual entity and and so right now we are seeing in recent days another physical fight over the land of israel and we wonder what is this all about why is there a struggle well because heaven is disturbed you know there there are lights in the skies or um unidentified objects that are there there's investigating angels that are coming in there there's a turmoil in the heavens there's turmoils upon the earth there is every kind of spirit rising up wanting preeminence amen you you have the white wanting their supremacy and the black one and their supremacy and the asians wanting their supremacy and russia wants to control the world the united states wants to control it and and china wants to control it and everybody is wanting preeminence and so in the land thereof israel there are two people that are fighting for the preeminence now the the preeminence to be supreme to be first now the people of israel we know are the original owners and remember going back in our own thought of us the bride the the the mankind he first had preeminence before satan did and we were his before satan ever got a hold of us and we look here at this land of israel and we see again the people of israel are the original owners of the land and they were given by it was given by god to possess this land but we have others today that want to take preeminence and to establish themselves as the possessors of the promised land now you look at history the book proves it the dead sea scrolls reveal that of israel's ownership and their first claim to the land that they were actually there that that's where they were from this is my land and we predate our ownership was before all others now we we look at the history and the and the book as we said proves it and and you you know as i spoke last sunday the israelites controlled jerusalem 1500 years before the romans came rome controlled jerusalem nearly 530 years and the muslims did took control for 500 years and then there was a great tug of war between the muslims and the catholics um the catholic crusaders against the muslims for the next 150 years and it would go back and forth the control over as they fought and then the muslim turks controlled it for the next 650 years until the british in him expanded their empire and they gained control for 30 years and now through the miraculous hand of god who was present in their battles the israelites are now back in their homeland now for the past 70-plus years amen i want you to get it it was right about the same time that god determined that her pride would go back to her homeland amen it would be with signs and wonders and the tear down of satan's kingdom and advancing in scriptures that had and promises of the word of god that had not been achieved in thousands of years now we we look at some the miraculous hands of god now let's just see what all this struggle is about now abraham had two sons but only one that god recognized is that right this struggle began between these people back in genesis it's a long struggle and genesis 21 tells you about the child having grown which is isaac having grown and was weaned and and there um ishmael um began to came and began to mock the child and and uh sarah saw it and she said cast out this bonds woman and her son for the son of this bonds woman will not be heir with my son even isaac and of course the thing displeased abraham and and god said to him said don't let this displease you because of the bob's woman said listen to her voice for in isaac shall thy seed be called now let's look at these two children one of them was the result of the weakness of sarah's faith amen the other was the result of the miraculous power of god when the faith came is that right so one is a child of faith the other is a child of doubt now again these are the two sons the ones that doubt one's faith there's a war between faith and doubt there's a war between the the offsprings now look they're in the same movement they're right you know right here as as in this case the seed of abraham one a child of doubt one child of the bonds woman the slave woman the other the child of the free and they will not be air together now so he said take thy son thine only son when god referred to isaac he referred to him as the only son i don't recognize the child of the bonds woman i only recognize the child of the three woman and they're not ours together but they but and i don't i don't receive the one i reject the one i accept the other as the one of the promise now so he is the one that was to inherit now that's the struggle today the child of the bombs woman the ismailites are wanting to have preeminence over the child of the free woman so when you hear of the palestinians laying claim to the land and the city the muslims are the ishmaelites the children of the bombs woman and the natural and here these two natural seeds are right there at the end time and they're fighting right over the same place right amen and this one is trying to claim one of them is claiming that you know the bonds woman child it was ishmael that abraham offered and and here the jews are laying to the rightful claim it was isaac and this is our land and this is our place and god had declared they'll not be heir together amen now now paul said that the bonds woman will not be heir with the children of the free woman he re-emphasizes that in the book of galatians now in the spiritual there is also as they type there is a a child of the bun's woman and a child of the free woman now let's talk about this in the spiritual that's the catholic and protestant denominations every denomination is a child of the slave woman they're in bondage under denominational rule amen and they lay claim now look they all of them are laying claim to the place that god chose his name to put his name in other words that they own jerusalem are the place of worship you've got to come here to be saved right amen but now there is also a bride and she's few in number in comparison like the muslims are millions and the jews are few and man you've got a few in the bride and millions of upon billions now of christianity and they're all claiming the promised land they're all claiming the rapture they're all claiming the inheritance they're all claiming that they are the rightful heir that they can take the bible and and put any kind of interpretation they want to [Music] and change the borders of the land of any whim that they have come on now amen but but i just want you to understand that the muslims are not the people of the book neither is any denomination the people of the book they are squatters on the land now it is not a muslim land first of all muhammad never visited jerusalem and and secondly islam didn't arrive there um it was 2 000 years when they aro arrived after joshua had established the nation of israel sixteen hundred years before the muslims came in david made jerusalem the capital of israel even christianity was founded there 600 years before the muslims came and and the the islamic dome of the rock where islam laid claim to that holy place was built 654 years after jesus died at calvary so the jewish temple was there long before the islamic dome of the rock laid claim to it now as we're looking at this remember now jerusalem we went through it last week was the place that god chose to put his name it said first kings 11 36 jerusalem the city which i've chosen me to put my name and and it was also there where the blood where blood was accepted to take away sin right and it had to be in jerusalem now the bible tells you that the meeting place where god will meet you is where the blood is and it's where he chose to put his name if you put a look with me at hebrews 9 22 and almost all things are by the law purged by blood and without shedding of blood there is no remission so sin can only be remitted by blood now let's just look at this as we look at the religions of the world today and i just want to name them even judaism is now a bloodless religion even with animal sacrifices they don't shed blood their bloodless religion when you look at islam there are bloody people all right murderers and so on but it's a bloodless religion amen they don't have blood in their sacrifice now let me just get a little closer as we look at this modern christianity is now a bloodless religion now like cain they're dependent on a beautiful altar uh upon which they present the works of their hands the fruit of their labor remember they're just like cain in the bible the the seed of the serpent is that right they're offering the fruit of their labors they sing about the blood they talk about the blood but they have no blood all their blood is historical amen i mean every bit of it is historical the but the blood let me just say the blood is not to be a historical substance that dried up on the ground or that stained the cross and let's just talk about it for a moment not only is it not hysterical or historical but but the blood of jesus was not human blood either amen it was not human blood now this is what brother branham told us to show us the father and he'll satisfy us which is one of the sermons i just listened to he said have you one this tune is three in this foreigners whatever you are we'll just get this in your mind right now you shake hands and you shake hands and say we're brothers look god was in christ reconciling the world to himself jesus was the son of god that god overshadowed mary and created in the womb a blood cell we couldn't you've heard people say we were saved by jewish blood we could not be saved by jewish blood it was just as sinful as any other blood we were we were saved by the blood of the gentiles no sir we wasn't even saved by human blood we were saved by the blood of god god's blood the germ life comes from the blood cell and the blood cell here came from god the creator who created a blood cell that brought forth the son of god now there at calvary the blood cell was broke open and the spirit of god living in that cell it came back on the day of pentecost in the form of the holy ghost in other words the life of the blood now in the blood is life and the life of the blood was poured out on the day of pentecost as the spirit fell upon the 120 these men and women women were not born of man nor of the will of flesh but they were born of god can i say it they were born of the blood of god if you ever receive the baptism of the holy ghost you have been birthed by the blood of jesus christ amen the life of god the spirit that was in the blood now so we're born of god thus the bride is the blood by the spirit now you know some of the early message movements um early on the persian movement came out that they were now offering cain's sacrifice and and of course to offer cain's sacrifices a bloodless sacrifice it's offering fruits of your hands it's offering your works and that movement is a is a bloodless cult amen now you know the reasons for you know the reasons the reason because denominations like cults every denomination's spirit makes a cult amen now brother branham said that there's no one ever known of god but what long to see god and there's just something in the human heart that calls out to see god and i've often made that statement every cult that ever raised in the world are nothing in the world but hungry children seeking bread and if the preacher doesn't give them the bread of life the devil will give him a garbage can to eat out of so we want to we got to give them the bread of life the word of god now let me just be clear the blood today is not some red substance it is not some element that is that is contains plasma it is the life of the blood the baptism of the holy ghost and that is the only blood that will save you is the life of jesus christ that was released from the blood cell there at calvary that came back on the day of pentecost when jesus offered his blood there in the heavens as a high priest and sent back his life back to the earth men and women were born of the blood of god are you with me now so you see even now men don't want the blood life of god and satan does everything that he can do to keep the church away from the blood which is the baptism of the holy ghost the blood life of god unless you have the holy spirit you have no blood amen that is his life amen that is that is the the the germ of god his life the holy spirit of god and you've got to be born of the holy ghost he's got to have preeminence in your life and every place of worship there must be the outpouring and the of the blood of jesus christ where that blood the holy spirit washes away sin washes away unbelief sets your faith back on truth again amen that's why you know he must have the preeminence now of course in the indictment brother branham would say why did they say all men should worship at jerusalem notice all of these are one in jerusalem let me just say it's not just the muslims that wants jerusalem the catholics have got their churches there and they want jerusalem all of these are fighting over the same place there's a war over this place now remember symbolically it is typing something that is greater greater and that is that all men are wanting to be the way the truth the life they're wanting to have preeminence over all are you with me now notice brother branham said why did they say all men should worship at jerusalem as there's only one place that god will fellowship with a man and that is under the blood of the sacrifice and that's the reason they had to come to jerusalem god will never meet with man nowhere else but under the blood that's why the main thing that we must seek out is the holy spirit of god being filled with the spirit every song filled with the spirit ever all our worship mixed with blood the spirit of god getting over the people responding back to the word of god in the spirit it's got to be spirit worship are you with me because god will never meet with man nowhere else but under the blood and when you turn the blood down when you turn the baptism of the holy ghost down then your meeting place with god has been taken away let me say if you just turn it into a mere confession of faith if you just take it into um into joining a church or being a part of a message group amman anything like that your meeting place with god is only under the blood that's why we must have the holy spirit in every service amen the ministry must be anointed by the holy ghost there's got to be blood all over it remember we are eagles and eagles eat live meat and man they're rippers of the beach and they take that fresh meat and the blood flows and it gets all over the eagle it sprays out over him and i'll tell you if you come to church and your dog and you don't get the blood all over you if you don't get the holy ghost all over you you are either eating on dead carcass around that is maggot bread and everything else or either that you you are not eating at all but i'll tell you if you're an eagle we're the carcass of the word is and the christ killed me to the word is the eagles would gather together there and when they do they're the rippers of the beast they carry into that word and the blood flow i'm glad to begin the worst of god and the blood flows amen the blood flows and the blood flows and it heals sickness and it removes sin and it takes away unbelief because the blood is flowing now bear in mind the blood is the holy spirit and that's the only place he meets with man today is under the shed blood of the sacrifice and brother see i don't care if you're a methodist baptist presbyterian or a roman catholic or whatever you might be will come under the shed blood god will meet both of us there in other words get the holy ghost and god to meet you there amen and that's where we can all meet in fellowship on the same grounds because he will not meet just because you're methodist he won't meet because you peruse your seven thunder or even mainstream or whatever title you want to give your your little group per click amen he won't meet you because you belong to evening light tabernacle and that you were born on a church pew that's not where you why he will meet you he'll meet you under one condition that's under the blood amen when you get the blood the holy ghost begin to move and there's where god will meet you that's where man and god comes together is under the blood now so the blood is always before him he can only see you through that shed blood and i'll tell you what if outside of that blood you're still a sinner you're still guilty amen only under that blood does he look through that blood and he sees you white as snow now he said that's the reason you don't see things happening in the churches they confess to believe the blood but they reject the very plan to get the blood the word now where what is it in the word where do we get the blood the spirit what word is it here's the word here's the plan to get the blood repent turn from your sins give god preeminence let it be lord over all and my people want to be a christian and won't give him lordship over their temper we'll give them come on now they won't give them the lordship over their lusts they want to keep their sins and still worship that on the side i want you to know this is a marriage he must be above all others he must have preeminence there's no room for any other person amen to any other spirit but him he must have pre-evidence the reason you don't see things happening in the churches they confess to believe the blood but they reject the very plan to get the blood the word and the word the word that gives you the plan to get to the blood is repent turn from your sins give god preeminence and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the blood or be born of it hallelujah amen now this is very very very vital and important that he have the preeminence let me just go over it again you know you cannot get the holy ghost without first giving him preeminence he won't dwell with you and somebody else there can be no other lovers but him there's no room in this marriage for anybody else come on your selfishness your pride your own ambitions your own desires he must be above all others this is why people go for years without giving the holy ghost is because they don't give him preeminence so well we don't need altar called brother altar calls them for that very purpose where you die out to your very sins to your unbelief amen will you come and give him preeminence now he said there he said there's only one place that god will honor that word you'll never honor it come say i'm a roman catholic i demand this to be done you can't do it methodist baptist pentecostals you can't do it let me just say message believer whatever you are amen the only way you can do it is under the mercies of god through his grace has come through the shed blood of jesus christ and say lord i claim the promise and then if you're really under the blood if you're really born again god's obligated to that word but first you've got to be under the blood you see it now no wonder they can't believe in miracles i'm quoting your prophet this is why they're not under the blood no wonder you can't believe in the supernatural you say well brother tim we believe it but it just don't work here then you don't believe it amen the supernatural won't work where people believe the reason they condemned it back there is the same reason they condemn it today they're guilty as guilty can be cause only under this shed blood and those who would dare dare some little brother who dares under humility to take god in his word and walk out there confessing his sin forget all these dogmas and things and stand under the blood and believe it they want to call him a fanatic or class him an oddball so now looking at this this is the only place god is going to meet you now denominations are the children of ishmael sons of hagar organizations of men they want to be the jerusalem the chosen place of worship but they can't be because they didn't believe for you as brother branham said in god's chosen place of worship can a denomination bleed you ever think of a church bleeding a denomination bleeding certainly not it taken blood to bleed from a life and that life here jesus comes into view by the lamb the lamb was a type of christ foreshadow christ because he was the lamb of god that john introduced it takes away the sin of the world we fly find jesus coming into view here in exodus 12th chapter it was only one place death could not strike when death was in the land there had to be a certain place all from under this died only one place that didn't mean it was one house but there was one place and that's where the lamb was killed where the lamb's blood was the death angel could not strike because it was one place god had put his name and that lamb was named back there in the beginning a lamb it was one place he could not strike and notice the same kind of thing today there's only one place that spiritual death cannot strike that's the word death can't strike the word because it's the living word of god but when you put creeds in it man made doctrines the word moves out to itself it'll separate like water from oil you can't mix it together therefore you see when the creed comes into denomination they all go after out they all go after the creed and the word dies out and goes on with somebody else and increases it more it picks up momentum goes on to justification sanctifiation baptism all holy ghosts and i'm out into the grain don't you see do you see the path that god has trod bringing his name all the the time right down the same because he is the word notice it can't die the word of life can't die notice how perfect the death angel was not forbidden to strike egypt's great intellectual people it wasn't forbidden to strike its sacred lands its great buildings or its pharaohs it could strike any building any place anybody but it could not strike where the lamb was now he the death angel was not forbidden to strike israel or its hebrew priest or any of their denomination all must be in god's chosen provided place or death struck church wherever you are what you belong to makes me no different but there's one thing you must know you've got to be in christ or you're dead you can't live outside of him your your church might be all right as a building your fellowship might be all right as man but when you deny the body the blood the word of jesus christ you're dead the minute you do it it's god's chosen place of worship there's where his name is exactly that's where he chose to put his name not in the church but in the son jesus christ notice the safety lies only in the place of his choosing in his lamb and in the name of the lamb notice it was a male lamb a key not a her not a church she but his name not her name but where he was going to meet his people was not in her name but in his name are you with me amen him the lamb this is really really important that we keep this it's not about her it's not about the church it's not about belonging to a group it's not about belonging to a group called evening like tabernacle it's becoming under his name amen under his blood under his life you've got to be born again of the spirit of god of the blood of god hallelujah amen amen sorry we lost you out there i'm sure but we're we're here in the congregation today amen i'll preach this to you and re-preach it again but now notice the church the great mighty church she did this and that oh she's weighed the storms with picked up in population we're great in number we're a mighty church she's a great thing but god never didn't say anything about the she he said him him is the meeting place the lamb not the church not her name but his name he didn't put her name anywhere he put his name in him amen that's why that when you're when you become his you take on his name not her name you're not a methodist or a baptist or even like tabernacles you are you are a child of the most high god and you take on his name you're identified with him you are his child you are his possession and you're there in his chosen place of worship amen that's why we are all we do in word or deed we must do it in the name of jesus christ if we pray we got to pray in the name of jesus if we ask petition we got to ask in the name jesus name if we walk we walk in jesus name if we talk we talk in jesus name if we baptize we're baptized in the name of jesus christ all we do in word of deed we do it all in that name remember again it is not about her name it's his name it is not about some preacher's name come on now he's part of the bride amen in his name there is power in his name there's redemption in his name there's forgiveness sin in his name there is healing and his name it's all about him it's all about jesus it's nothing about it's all about the [Applause] [Music] and the blood is not a literal blood but the life of the blood cell that was released at calvary came down on the day of pentecost now if you not receive the holy ghost by experience as they did on the day of pentecost you're still not under the blood let me say that again if you have not received the holy ghost by experience not by church joining not by profession of faith not by saying you believe brother martin's a prophet or jesus is lord amen but as they did on the day of pentecost you are not under the blood right amen so as we look at this let's just go a little play a little further in the indictment so we find it there then only under the blood that god met the worshipper so they met jerusalem and christ and god's provided the lamb of sacrifice amen and today there's only one place that god will meet man and that's under the blood of jesus christ anything anywhere else is condemned god will never hear amen now you might do all kinds of emotion of all kinds of isms and shake and jump and have blood and fire and smoke and everything else but as long as that life isn't compared to the word and god thoroughly identified that life [Music] [Applause] so you see the scripture we got in jerusalem the church house it's in heaven right amen and there is the jerusalem we are contending for amen yes muslims wanted over here in the middle east the jews wanted over there but that's not like jerusalem amen listen it's not our jerusalem why jerusalem is from the pub headquarters it is not jeffersonville it's not under a creed we try to make in jerusalem the method is he said we'd like to make the methodist headquarters of jerusalem the catholics would like to make wrong in the different places where we have our headquarters we'd like to make a jerusalem but the bible said our jerusalem is from above which is the mother of all beings amen [Applause] amen now when we get an eating cow you know from jeffersonville that says quit preaching and play tapes what do we do that's not jerusalem [Applause] amen that's not our jerusalem i remember jesus commissioned the disciples to preach right his last commission was go preach and all the apostles preached all the and paul when he left from here as he was leaving he said preach the word and there's a fight there there's a fight um over everything now that's right i mean we're going to lose everything all power here as far as electricity in about seven minutes so if you're if you're worried about that i'm not [Applause] [Music] now notice here all of them that want to make some creed or we want a magnet of jerusalem as he said we want to make we want to make us somebody you can move closer if you need to fact if you want to get close to anointing don't sit way back there get up here come on notice again you know our you know they want to make a creed three means this is what we believe they want to make this in jerusalem that's right you know but but again the catholics would like to make wrong deseries right all men must come to wrong they must play oh basically you know the methodist was theirs to be you know let me just say the organizational moves in this message want to make it make their movement amen in jerusalem right this is where you have to come where you got to come is you got to get in the cross [Applause] god's only place of safety jesus [Applause] now again where god chooses the fight the fight is over jerusalem today who owns the name of god right you know who is the place where god is chosen to place his name where all men must come to worship right again this is where the fight is is the fight for preeminence here's the bible you know let me just say no church no preacher right no man no matter his title is as pastor or bishop or apostle or pope is out for him amen you have one husband one day you know that's the best the preacher the pastor is the friend of the bridegroom yes i meant to introduce the bride to christ but the bride doesn't belong to the preacher the pride belongs to the bridegroom amen oh but you know a man who covet god's place of dominion over his people they want preeminence that's right and then this news the very messages itself that god gave us to give us freedom remember this message to give us freedom [Applause] amen to strip out the denomination you are the everyone have the holy ghost [Applause] but you know again men covet god's place and dominion over his people that's why as a pastor i refuse to be your holy guilt amen i refuse to take lordship over you buy the kind of car you want come on take the vacations you want make sure you're led by the holy ghost not by laodicea whether or not you just become lukewarm cold and formal okay and therefore you don't have the desire that you're supposed to have to be in the house of god and don't think i don't have the right to preach against sin but i don't have a right to make you living and it wouldn't help if i didn't make it sitting back there in the back there and we've given that spot there where when you stand up he can see and and and and so there he he gets a special privilege seat back there every service yeah because i wanted to be able to see when when when you're when you all stand you can still see yeah and so but i mean many years ago he said that's him i know i can live with god i i can do right if you just go with me to work and to to town or whether you need some preaching somewhere to tell you how to live and what to do and to go with you everywhere and make life's decisions you're to seek the holy ghost for that he have preeminence in your life and and the holy ghost will have the preemies listen i've heard pastors personally heard of my upgrade rebuke individuals for taking vacations without their permission nicolaitanism there's nothing wrong with being with taking vacations and being gone from church on occasion but i'll tell you this when it becomes a regular thing that you're all doing that all the time that's wrong amen but i'm not gonna make your personal decision you've got to have the holy ghost and seek him as to what you do i just know that we've got a responsibility to the world and man we've got a responsibility in the world we're not able to preach that to the world right now but we have got responsibility to the world as the sound of our voice goes around the world to instruct to encourage to build up the body of christ and you participate in that when you can go fishing or where you can go hunting i ain't making decisions on that you make decision but like brother rotten said if you're way out in the wilderness somewhere on the hunting trip and there's no church around there's nothing you can do if you speak i believe it'd be all right if you're around the city the word church is going on you should attend church by all means amen but don't think as i said that pastors don't have the responsibility and truth to get laodicea and we look for in conditions that people want to put pleasures ahead assembling themselves together preachers have the responsibility to call out sin as brother friends and playing call from sunday at picnic parties and swimming and things instead of attending church sitting home on wednesday night watching television still attending shirt and feel like something saying something about it but the lord will put them out what's the matter it's love again looking out his window and seeing the sin and afraid to call sin sin but you see what people want today is a son of kiss some king saul to be a king over them instead of god oh my this is this is where we want to move on from here let me just tell you among men it's not supposed to be that that he said you know those that are considered rulers of the gentiles lorded over them and their great ones exercise authority over them but it shall not be so among you but whoever would be great among you must be your servant whoever be first among you must be a slave of all but you see nicholas who destroys those press precepts and instead separates the minister from the people and makes the leaders of the lords over instead of servants as peter said neither being lords of god's heritage but being examples to the flock so we are to lead the flock by feeding the world we preach the word you can apply every now the message is the trumpet call of freedom it is a juvenile trumpet saying you're afraid for christ is to have preeminence but can you imagine how satan wants to use message the message itself to build again denominational walls and many of them are worse than the mother herself dividing churches dividing families through you know forbidding fellowship saying all maturity can only come by belonging to a certain group that the token can only be obtained by belonging to a certain group that corruption can only hide in a certain group let me tell you it's not a group affair i want to get it to you [Applause] his presence in the individual with a personal vindication of himself expressing himself the living word that's promised for the day expressing itself through you a vindication of the great revelation of god look only in the individual never a group an individual not in the group his identification is with an individual you get that not with the methodist the baptist not the president here not the lutheran not the pentecostal but as an individual i'll take one and leave one i'll separate them do you know that's going on he'll take one he'll leave one he'll take one he'll leave one come on yeah everybody doesn't circle right there and there this is the way that it works he will take it and [Applause] vindication of an impregnated child of god filled with the holy ghost so surrender to god that he don't care about anything else and the holy spirit is living his life pulsating through him showing the personal vindication of the word itself expressing itself to the people and to the world that's right amount of personal vindication not a church dedication a personal visitation every person loves and now but you see each group wants to claim to be jerusalem men wants to sit in the place of worship and it's all about the children of the slave woman that wants to be heir with the children of the free woman these spirits have been back in genesis where jews sarah's lack of faith in her position as a mother of the chosen race in her weakness she gave a slave girl hagar to be the mother of the race therefore today they're still now the preeminence the fight for the preeminence the jews the original orders they claim the muslims they claim the catholic and the protestant denomination they want to be the jerusalem the battle is all about moving the squads am i the person who would a squatter is a person who unlawfully occupies an uninhabited building our peace of life yeah hey so this is what is going on this is what the struggle has been about here recently yeah the rights the battles that have been in gaza has been over the supreme court decision of israel giving rights to the israeli to legally remove palestinians from properties purchased by the jews and when they just heard that they were going to be here and a decision to aim to death right and when they just heard about it they began to write and upload you see this is something's happening the very moment he heals [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] is [Applause] historically speaking in 1982 the palestinian residents signed an agreement accepting the jewish ownership of the land while being allowed to still live there as protected tenants and the palestinian residents have since repudiated the agreement and ceased to pay rent so they wanted to squat that they don't want they don't want to pay rent they don't want to recognize even the agreement that they signed now that's just like the devil oh you'll agree that the promise is yours as long as you don't try to possess it yeah yeah come on but i want you to know that heaven's supreme court has taken the seals off of the book yeah all the ancient records and so plainly that the throne is ours remember he said in the expedition of the seven churches what the church had originally she had the pure word of god she had the power of the spirit manifest and guide the signs and wonders and gifts of the holy ghost amen [Applause] is [Applause] god [Applause] that's when the war begins revelation 12 and 7 i want to just show you the outcome of this battle and we'll start up from there again next service revelation 12 7 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels he ain't given up easily that's right listen church can you make a mistake when you get you think you get prayed far and the devil's just going to get up and play dead he's going to fight you he will bring your unbelief there he is within the wars that will take place right on the platform [Music] [Applause] amen there would be all kinds of things that would be happening since it would even annoy men when brother branham would tell him to bow your heads yeah that's rubber chicks and man because of all the unbelief that was perfect just bow your head and they refused to do it and they would fall out under demon spirits when they were cast out is that right but notice that wall was in heaven and the eight michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels like is that there's a war going on there's a war going on for our [Applause] are you with me but i want you to know that dragon fought in his angels and listen to the to the end of the battle and they prepare not listen to the prophecy listen to the earth [Applause] is [Applause] oh oh just lift your hands and praise him hallelujah we have given you the victory thank you oh hallelujah i want you to go ahead and thank you for your healing right now your deliverance right now all the salvation of god right now oh blessed be the name of the lord all praise the father we thank you lord lord the enemies been against us but they prevail not hell has been against us but it has not overcome us we still remain here today father fighting the good fight of faith lord praise you forever heal and praise you forever and you give us thank you we praise you for everything you've done for us lord [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] yes all right [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] is we're talking about how great our god is and i just want to give a testimony to that um i don't know how many people there's been several quite a few people that know last year i was served two lawsuits uh concerning the business and uh they've been going on for months and i had asked i'd come up several times for prayer asking the brothers to pray and timothy and brother aaron and brother tim all had preached such tremendous services on he is our warrior god he fights for us in the battle let him fight the battle he fights for us and i just wanted to testify that about a month ago the first one came to trial my lawyer had called me the day before not trial but had went to court the lawyer had called me the day before and said there's two different ways if this was to be dismissed that it could be dismissed and he explained it to me he said this would be the best outcome and he explained it he said but there's a very slim chance that that will happen he said it could be dismissed in another way and so i had actually flown to tucson to see my mom he called me about two hours after i landed and he said i just want to tell you that the court today the judge dismissed it in the way that i didn't think he would he said and it's dismissed and uh he said there's a small chance it could come back in a in about 30 days there's an opportunity for it to be you know maybe resurface but it has not and god has totally taken that and i just want to give him all the praise and the honor of glory because he is faithful he is in every situation i can testify over the last three years there's been situations where god has proved himself faithful over and over and over again it may not be even a sickness as a trial you're going through it could be another type of trial but i just want to testify god is faithful there's another one that's going to be heard this week the second one and i just covet all your prayers knowing our god is faithful he's going to take care of this one too and i want to thank him right now ahead of time for that amen well if you did it before he'll do it again amen that's that kind of god we serve god bless you today i know this has kind of ended a little different and maybe not the way we thought it would be going but god knows and he's faithful amen and we we want to thank him for his goodness and his mercy let's sing that again i don't know if the deacon's got some flashlights or something they can turn on them mezzanines especially we'll let them the mezzanine be dismissed first and uh be brought down very very safely as possible
