sitting as one great big church family we're here today [Applause] to rejoice to thank god for what he's done for where he's brought us amen 2020 i told you is a year of miracles where it has been necessary that the faith that we have been taught is put to work if faith is must not remain dormant and god's been giving you an opportunity to exercise that faith to learn to move in the spirit to realize you can be like daniel and stand alone you can be like the hebrew children have to face a fire alone just three three young men daniel somewhere else must been in another part of the kingdom but anyway the rest of the believers abandon while they stand alone we're going to stand in this day we're not quitters amen we're the unstoppable bride of jesus christ and we shall prevail amen we are resilient we are overcomers we are predestined for this hour we have been placed here at this time and we will stand on god's unchangeable word we started this year with the word to joshua you remember it started right at the end of the year of 2019 i preached concerning the year to come it was my new year's message as we approached it amen don't fear but be of good courage for unto you i've given this land wherever your feet or your foot sets upon that i have given to you amen i will not leave you i will not fail thee as i was with moses so will i be with you we're here right here

we appreciate you we glorify your name thank you for those of you of us that could assemble today bless those that could not come lord i pray that you'll just remove all fear from the body of christ and that you'll just be with us in these times lord it's trying times but you said i'll never leave you or forsake you as i was with moses i'll be with you and you told the messenger of our generation you told him don't fear to go anywhere or do anything for the never-failing presence of jesus christ is with you wherever you go lord i pray oh god as we enter into worship today together as a family

not o lamb be glad and rejoice for the lord will do great things we could close the book and go home right here with great rejoicing today just because of what he said the lord will do great things i want you to repeat that with me the lord will do great things amen be not afraid ye beast of the field for the pastures of the wilderness this spring for the tree beareth her fruit the fig tree and the vine that yield their strength be glad then you children design and rejoice in the lord your god for hath given you the former rain moderately and he shall will cause to come down for you the rain to form former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankle worm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you and ye shall eaten plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that has dealt wondrously with you and always love reading this and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that i am in the midst of israel amen and that i am the lord your god and none else and he repeats it and my people shall never be ashamed it should come to pass afterwards that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the hands maids in those days will i pour out my spirit and i will show wonders in the heavens and then the earth and blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness the moon and the blood before the great and terrible day the lord come and shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be delivered for in mount zion that's the bride in jerusalem that's israel shall be deliverance and as many as the and as the lord has said and in the remnant that's of course the leftover remnant is a leftover that's the church whom the lord shall call amen i believe there's deliverance in every area of god's people every name that's in the book shall be delivered that's what the word says amen you can have your seats god bless you thank you for coming today we're looking forward to today letting the holy spirit speak to us we want to greet you those of you from um that have joined in with us from around the world a little brother wrote us and said i i'm rejoicing i i'm joining in from swaziland over in southern africa brother kaelin has joined in with us this morning from south africa others from that that area that has joined in with us many more will as we resume our services i will i will say this as we go forward we have no plans to do this again to shut down services for time um we um we will just go ahead and persevere through whatever we go through amen amen and you know i mean you know those that are fearful and afraid they can stay home um the rest of us will just come on and and go through whatever storm we have to go through amen because he says the lord thy god is with thee i'm in the midst of israel and i am the lord your god so we're here in a wonderful time in a moment and you've had moments and opportunities where that your your faith has been exercised we have been through some great battles some of us have been in the hospital thankfully we have lost none that have um passed on we have sister churches that have had preachers past our ministers in their church that passed on and we've had those that had deacons that have been long-time elders in the church that passed on and so we we have faced a formidable enemy but none of it none of it has not been without god's provision and also knowing that god's will rules over it all and i say to those that have lost family members it's that maybe you're listening in today and you've lost family members or friends or whatever in your churches god bless you and may god comfort you and god give you strength but it's not all lost amen they're healed they're in a new body they're rejoicing on the other side waiting for us to come i'm going to be speaking today on the changing of the seasons and as you can see on our screen today that but the word of the lord stands forever so no matter what changes in seasons or even progressions that are made the word of god always stands forever it's always constant is there for us to have as an absolute and an assurance and that's where we must take our and place our faith today is an assurance of god's word now i wanted to share a little quotation as we went along i i thought of this as i took this title and said brother branham told us in a testimony of a true witness so if we are christian and we're born of the spirit death can hold nothing but victory for us because this so corruptible body that satan still has power over will drop in the dust of the earth but when that season he says this is the wrong season now this is mortal season but but immortal season is coming when the immortal one comes he will bring with him the immortal spirits that is returned to him from the earth and they will come forth again in the resurrection for the great millennium and shall shine in his glory and as i was praying this past wednesday morning and thinking about these things and even the translations of the saints and and um and even the the approaching translation of the bride of christ is i believe we are nearer now than we've ever been we've run out of church ages we're at the end of the ages and you know time is about to end for us as we move into eternity time will continue on on the earth for the thousand-year millennial reign and of course the time of the tribulation they'll all be in time until that morning breaks eternal bright and fair where that we um know the new heavens and the earth will come and the earth will move back from time into eternity but as i was praying wednesday morning i envisioned us putting on our new bodies like children putting on new clothes and dancing and shouting about how we look and we feel in them giggling and crying and laughing and dancing around like kids and talking excitedly about how we look and then embracing and dancing around with those that have gone on before us and seeing them in their new clothes i can remember you know as a young boy i only had a pair of cowboy boots once in my life and that was about when i was about eight years old and my parents i could wear a pair of cowboy boots and i remember prancing around in them and showing off my new boots but that ain't gonna be nothing like what it'll be that day when i show off my new body amen when we look around and sickness and old age and and problems of life just fade away into oblivion and we'd move into that realm of the eternal youth now we know that we're living in a time where great darkness is sweeping over the earth we can feel this darkness it's so thick it's a it's an awful day that we're living in but yet it's a tremendous day all the same time because we are living in the time of the fulfillment of scripture where the word of god is being manifested to an end time people and the people are being put on display and and this great darkness swinging over the earth now is it is only declaring that there is a great light that is pressing down and that we are about to change the seasons and that's what i'm going to speak on today as we move from this time and this realm of darkness into into the light of god's word and promise he said this is a time right now where death is hanging close that it could be within an hour and we can speak of that as we look at the dying of freedom in america when we look at anarchy on every side and troubles on every hand like never before so we're living in a time where we we see the dying of the lamb and the birth of a dragon as america begins to turn from a lamb with freedom of religion into a dragon and i'm not gonna go in some rhetoric of my politics today and and say well you need to get out and vote i was praying about all of that the other day and i'll be honest with you i want to who i i'll tell you who i want to win i want the man to win who will usher in the end time in a greater depth than ever because i'm ready to go home [Music] amen oh i really don't want the man to get in there that will um that will perpetuate things and make things a little nicer for a little while longer i'm ready to leave this world amen we have we have marked a lot of time we have been through the ages and i'm longing for jesus to come back and you may be screaming i'll wait a little longer please jesus i got loved ones i'll tell you friends it comes a time where that you will say even so come lord jesus whatever you have to do just don't leave us while we're out amen but bring up bring about an end to struggling world and struggling nature we're here at the at a time as i said where death is hanging so close that it could be within an hour hey man we we're threatened with with with china rising up and communism and and we're and even in our own country in anarchy and and every kind of movement until there's never been such a time of confusing in darkness amen and nobody's got an answer nobody has the answer for it but you see if if death is hanging that close you see then life has to be hanging that close in fact you know it's the coming of the light that could gels the darkness i mean this is why there's darkness just before the dawn and it gets darker than ever it's because the coming light is pressing drop us back and it's hanging low life is hanging low it's coming down in our dimension we've had things happen in this layout laodicean age that has never happened in the other ages except the first we're here in a time where the great holy spirit is moving in and it's restored back to us the original baptism of the holy ghost the true token the abstract amend that the same thing that they had on the day of pentecost not a measure of faith not a measure of truth but the full truth not a measure of the spirit such as justification or sanctification but the fullness of the spirit where that we can walk in the in the fullness of the light of the world the great holy spirit is moving in and darkness is taking this last toll amen but christ will come because the light will soon be here it doesn't take much light ain't meant to shine in darkness and to push darkness back we get to close the doors and shut off all the artificial light and strike one match and it would so illuminate among the word that it is close to everybody in the room from the forest furthest one back would see that light shining amen and it tells us that the word of god will abide it forever and the great holy spirit is moving in and darkness taking this last toll because the light will soon be here and christ will come and the joy and the hope of the ages for a real resurrection of the saints amen for all believers for we will share with him in his resurrection as we shared with him in his suffering he that suffers with me will reign with me so don't be surprised you've been through a bit of suffering amen should we be carried to the skies or into the heavens on a flowery bed of ease when others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas and the psalm the psalmist said no i must fight if i must reign increase my courage lord so that's a prayer we can't go forth as a coward we cannot just go around daily with our head hanging down i mean don't don't live in the in anxiety when the scripture says over and over again fear not even when he says i'm with you wherever you go amen i'll never fail you i will be with you even in you to the end of the world why live under and be captive to anxiety when we can when we can walk as as christians looking at the promise of god oh my when we look at the world and they're carrying on the darkness that is going on we can raise our head and hear congregate today as eagles amen and knowing this that we know him in the power of his resurrection amen because that he lives we shall live also amen you see that's what it means to us as believers we are part of his resurrection you know as we think back you know they they have times of passover and like like easter time and which is passover it was a harvest season it was a time when the barley would become ripe and with it would come a celebration later in our month of may is another harvest season where the wheat becomes ripe and this would happen seven weeks after um after the passover at pentecost and this is our season we are in the season of pentecost amen because we have come through the the seven weeks or the seven ages which that typed and this is a time where the day of pentecost is fully coming it's a jubilee a man and all the types of the bible have pointed to our day into our hour amen and every type in the bible again is here again but this time in fulfillment we are we're here even to an easter even to a passover even to a pentecost even to um the feast of the tabernacles everything is coming right into fruition at this time every type of the bible is heading up into our hour in our time now remember type is is a shadow so it's it's something that is coming and the and the light is coming from down from the light and as it comes down it casts a shadow and as it casts a shadow it's prophesying and foretelling what it will be like when the actual thing comes are you with me amen and so this is this is where we're at we're with all the angels that prophesied of us all the angels are spoke of this time and i'll tell you today that all the ages all of them that are going for before us are are depending on us they are waiting on us to fulfill and to finish this race so there is a great responsibility that is upon our shoulders this morning as we face the end time prophecies now and it is the rising of the sun when brother branham first talks about a bright age and we do believe we're in a bright age we're here in the laodicean age but it is the bright age it is a time when it is a an era of time within the last age where it moved from the azusa street under a movement in where that they were they were the the the ones that god was using to where now god is calling the bride out of every denomination back to the word again are you with me amen so he says for the bright age it will be a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message and here's our message that the full maturity of the word has turned back in full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there so here's our message today we know what the message is the full maturity of the word has come back [Music] amen the season has changed until that in this changing of the season is now a time of harvest it's a time of ripening it's a time of a mature church of an elect lady of a people who knows who they are of an adopted church who knows their [Applause] position and have the same signs and wonders that he did back there because i live speaking to his wife he shall live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be a made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power if we look at that for a moment i want to just say to you as brother branham looked at this season he would call it even an easter season a resurrection season it's a time where resurrection life is here it is a time of great restoration is a time of restoring all the truths that were lost and all the power that was lost and all the anointing that was lost down through the ages of being restored back to the last age and that's what brother branham would say that christ is the same yesterday today and forever and we're seeing the hour we're living in we need an easter in the church resurrection we need a resurrection to power faith amen men and women to stand out for what which is god's vindicated word hallelujah amen since a resurrection hour the brother brandon said we needed it's a restoration hour universe resurrection is a restoration it's a restoring back to life but it's even more because it brings them back and man when jesus raised he didn't raise a a a a a body that was wounded and horribly disfigured he rose alive so changed till they on the way to emmaus did not recognize him in his new condition amen amen and that's where you're going to raise that's the way you're going to be changed i mean when we all get together and we begin to travel like a thought and come from place to place and visit home to home to home to home and we see one another some of us i'm gonna have to introduce myself to some of them i'm going to have to ask them to introduce their self amen i'm going to have to say you're brother elle oh yeah your brother el well words of glasses don't need them hey man look at my hair look at my new body oh man look how i can run amen look i look at my strengths look at my youth hallelujah amen we're gonna look around at one another and i'll see some of you like i've never seen you before [Applause] hallelujah with eyes that never saw like them eyes a man that can see in between the dimensions we're here at the changing of the season in a resurrection hour brother branham uses the word essence it's the nature of something that determines a character its character or the property of something without which it would not exist to be what it is here then is the essence of the resurrection the properties of it the resurrection shows and proves that jesus is not dead but he's alive as he said in the easter seal the very essence of this resurrection is to tell and to show and to prove that jesus has raised from the dead amen and he's not dead he's a living i can remember you know the different ones he would appear to mary magdalene he would appear to the other women at the tomb he would appear to peter he would appear to the disciples he would appear to thomas had to get him on board get him away from his unbelieving attitude that he had come on amen to where he would scream out those notable words my lord and my god amen amen that's what god would do he's not going to leave a predestinated even a doubting thomas he ain't going to leave them behind he'll come and he'll show it come on he'll show up to reveal itself to get you on board amen how many would say oh god show up to me today get me on board get me past my unbelief get me past this darkness let me see clearly what you're doing in this hour he would appear he would appear to them on the road to them of emmaus he would appear and paul would say and he appeared to me hallelujah and i didn't want to say and he's appeared to me amen and blessed are those that love his appearing and he appeared to you and to you and he's appeared to you and to you and he's appeared to you and that to you and you know he's alive and our message is he's appeared to me and he's not a dead god he's not a god of history he's the god of the presence hallelujah because he's appeared to me so that's the essence of the message remember because it's a resurrection message where it tells the suffer the weary the downtrodden to stand and be healed amen it assures them that we are the resurrection and the life come on now i didn't say he yes though yes but you are now the resurrection and you are now the life it dwells in you amen oh yes i was once dead in sins and trespasses but now i'm alive forevermore and i've got the keys to death and of hell amen satan's eden cannot lock me in i've got the keys to death in hell hell cannot hold its gates against me i got the keys to it you know what happened when god gave you the keys to that alcohol amen to that pornography to those demons that were holding you back you know what it was when he took drugs out of your life you know what it was when he took sin out of your life whatever it was he gave you the key to it and i'll tell you today no devil no habit no problem no weapon can stop you from going through that gate because the gates of hell cannot prevail against this church it's the essence of our message it's not a dead message it's not a message of death it's a message of life goodness tell that clock what being so busy come on amen now it assures me it shows others that we are the resurrection and the life it's not a dead message but one of life it's the message of the resurrected are you with me without this property or essence the message is dead it's worthless but this message declares that it's a message of life it declares the healer the deliverer has conquered death and that we are beneficiaries of his resurrection as he said in the rising of the sun now the very essence are the properties of the message that was sent that he has risen from the dead and we are his beneficiaries we share the resurrection with him and draw benefits from them from this by proving to the world that he's alive and we cannot do it by word only we cannot do it by some tradition of man we can only reflect we only reflect exactly what we're pointing to so if we're pointing to that he's alive it's going to reflect back in us that he's alive if we point to that he's the healer and was wounded by our transgression we're going to reflect back that he is the healer hallelujah you see the absence of the message the properties of the message that was sent if he's risen he would say about that easter i've stamped it on my heart as the greatest event of the year it's a resurrection time why am i talking about easter now it's october because we are in an easter season we're in a restoration hour amen you see seasons can change here the grass will wither and the flowers fade and we can look and we can see now that this fall starts coming in and the color starts changing and the leaves will start falling and it will go down to death but the word of god doesn't change and god's word declares that this is the greatest event of all time we're in another resurrection hour and god still rolls the stone and the angel sat upon it and there is no devil and no power that's going to roll that stone back in place [Music] amen you think about it for a moment the angel of god came when the stone was rolled back he rolled it back and he sat on it and there wasn't a government big enough there wasn't legislation that was big enough there was in roman soldiers and courterians of soldiers that could stop it come on church because the angels sat upon the stone and i'll tell you he's still sitting on that stone today he's making sure that nobody puts christ back in the tomb again let's go back in thinking for a moment they've been great men's prophets teachers kings leaders but finally they they arrive for mankind to be delivered from the tyranny of sin same is true today we come to another time just like that the you know there have been great moves of the past there's been the lutherans wesley finney moody smith wigglesworth f bosworth and more i mean time would fail us to call all the names of the great men that god is used in the past but there must come a season where where the church moves in the power of the resurrection where the fullness of the promises may manifest just like brother branham said at the church today as he compared the bride with the church as two cars both are shiny both right off the assembly line both filled with gas of the highest octane but one with mechanics only a great machine but no dynamics and the other with both dynamics and mechanics and this is why you would say there has been churches churches brides prides but there will come one that will be the word amen there's got to come a real bride that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it amen oh my not just some some car with a polishing job and a beautiful finish and you can see yourself as it mirrors your image back as you approach it and all this stuff it's so classy and beautiful and this stained glass windows and it's high spears and it's sitting there oh my cold is a morgue it's never started the days of starting has passed it won't crank amen now but there's another new car that has just come out in this last day and it's rolled off of god's assembly line and he took luther's message and wesley's message and pentecostal message and i finally bring it back to oh my goodness it looks exactly like that old antique paul's message hallelujah and it shines and glows with the glory of god on it and it'll drive down the healing it'll drive to miracles it'll tie to salvation it'll drive hallelujah to deliverance they've been great prophets every one of them died before us there have been great prophets before jesus never one of them would just about without fail almost all of them would go down to the grave except for an enoch and an elijah have been prophets on earth that even healed the sick raised the dead they did great signs but when jesus rose from the dead he authenticated the word of god forever and every gloom and doubt was shattered amen man had been shut up in the prison house even religious people of this of his day been great religious moves and when a man died he just seemed to settle it you know moses died seemed to just nullified everything he said joshua died israel wasn't doing what every man thought was right in his own eyes but when this one came he said i have the power to lay my life down and to raise it up again amen and of course he he proved that when he raised from the dead and that seals it for us we know that when he raised he raised and conquered every sickness every disease every sin the days of jesus was a very supernatural time where heaven was pouring out a message angels had appeared think of that after years and years of silence here angels appeared to zechariah and then to mary and then the inspiration came from the angel's visitation it would hit elizabeth and mary and anna and simeon and they would prophesy about what god was doing and then it would come on joseph and the angels would come and and break through the dimensions to shepherds amen and john comes on the scene as a forerunner and he's announcing there's one among you and he's here amen he's here somewhere standing among you somewhere and then a light like a job then come down and a voice out of heaven and then it would come to decreasing of that messenger that forerunner as he would move off the scene and the message was now in flesh as jesus demonstrated god to the world amen what was it it changed from the prophet john to his prophecy jesus these junctions are so hard for people the changing of seasons is difficult you find people like in acts 19 who who were good people but missed the junction there were disciples of john but didn't know of jesus and his resurrection they were baptized of john but didn't know who he pointed to they idolized the prophet they idolized his boldness they thought they were ready for the messiah but they didn't know the messiah had come and was crying had been crucified and ascended and sent back his holy spirit and changed forms again and that now he was on earth the messiah was on earth in a multi-member body of his church amen oh brothers we hear them still talking about brother branham today who like john the forerunner brought a message they're still enamored infatuated to the point of enchantment about the forerunner amen and if they've never seen the one he was pointing to and that's even true about jesus people are enchanted about the man of galilee they're talking about the resurrection but if jesus listen to me now if jesus had only raised from the dead and and and completed and that completed everything we would still be in our sins that resurrection power had to come in the hearts of god's children amen it wasn't enough for it to be in jesus it had to be in his people amen every believer has to participate in his resurrection and become the resurrection also amen not to not just to know that he rose from the dead but no they had risen with him and that's what jesus pointed to go to the city of jerusalem and wait until you're endued with power from on high amen i you know we we have we have um a church just down this the road from where i live and and they're nice people lovely people a baptist church but they have on their signs we preach christ and him crucified and that's all that's on their side we preach christ and him crucify i want you to say why preach the dead christ amen we preached that christ rose from the dead amen that he was seen of 500. sent it up in heaven and not only that but he's here today because he came back again on the day of pentecost the same yesterday today and forever we preach a christ that's alive not just of christ crucified that's only part of the gospel not even just christ resurrected that's still only a part but a christ that came again a christ that now dwells in you jesus was rejected by the by the church world he was put in a tomb on the third day he rose bringing with him the old testament saints he ascended with them into glory 50 days after his crucifixion in the past over there his holy spirit came on what we call the day of pentecost there in the upper room the resurrection happened again the quiz acquaintance power struck 120 and they were filled with the spirit of jesus the holy ghost now god was in his church a man and his church was the body that he was working through and now that same jesus was working through a multi-member body amen doing the same works that he did and they were resurrection from death unto life it was a spiritual resurrection ephesians 2 and 5 said even when we were dead in sins hath he quickened us together that means he made us alive by with christ for by grace of your sake and he raised us up together and made us to sit in heavenly places in christ jesus these were more anointed my science they did the works that jesus did for they were filled with jesus but unfortunately the second eve who caller the church did what the first team did satan got into the book of acts church he come in saying we don't need shouting we don't need speakers with tongues and soon begin to tweak the gospel until god was no longer one but three no longer was jesus the intercessor but mary no longer were the days of miracles present but something of the past and soon the real experience of the baptism of the holy ghost was lost from the church and the power was gone and the church plotted along with dead forms as they put christ back in the tomb then it came to age of reformation with lutzer wesley and azusa street remember they were under the mayonnaise we're in the eagle age there's a change in the season the season was changing suddenly that comes on the scene one like john the baptist he's a forerunner he has a ministry of elijah but also the ministry of christ what was it the tomb the tomb was you know the tomb was sealed but revelation and and we know that but the book of revelation shows that the book was sealed so at the close of the old testament you have a tomb that was sealed and this at the close of the end time we have a book that is sealed and without his opening all is lost unless it's given back to man it is all for nothing it represents the title amen it is the possession of every divine lays promise that title it is the description of the lamb it is the title deed of redemption amen and unless the book is open calgary is for nothing oh man you say brother tim how could that be well let me stop here for a minute without the resurrection calvary was for nothing without the ascension the resurrection was for nothing and without the coming of the holy ghost all of it was for nothing are you with me amen one was making way for another they were it was it was seasons it was time this was here this was the part this is what god was doing but it moves on [Applause] now just as if jesus just resurrected and appeared to his disciples raised the dead of the ages but didn't send a resurrection in a change for those waiting at pentecost it would have been for nothing for those 120 and even for us today and let me just go come on bring it fast forward now to here in this pentecost i told you this is another pentecost right unless the seventh seal was open break the silence on his coming amen there must be an actual time that it happens let me just say it this way if there's no rapture in this age everything god has done since pentecost has been for nothing come on somebody amen god sent in a prophet god sent it let me go back to jesus god sent in the gifts of the spirit god returning and pouring out a portion of his spirit again all of these portions poured out would be for nothing unless there's a rapture takes place everything hinges on a rapture and i want you to know we're a part of that great rapture today and everything is hinging on you walking into that rapture amen the bible tells you revelation 8 1 when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space for a half hour and he said i saw the seven angels which stood before god and they were given seven trumpets and another angel come and stood at the altar having a golden censor that was given to him with much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints from the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came uh with the prayers of the saints ascended up before god out of the angel's hand and the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire the altar and cast into the earth and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake and you're wondering why there's an upheaval and you're wondering what's happening to our world and you wonder why our country is overrun with anarchists and you wonder why they have all given their mind to the beast you wonder why all of this taken place it's because god has broke the silence on his coming and he's wrapping up the end time here in this changing of the season and he throws in that seventh seal he throws that fire upon the earth a man and it begins to burn with voices amen that would be avoid the voice of the seventh angel revealing the voice of the seven thunders amen and there was thunderings that become known and lightnings and an earthquake and things and upheaval begins upon the earth and it's all in fulfillment to all of those who have prayed down to the ages for the coming of the lord and you are here in that season get ready for your new clothes [Applause] hallelujah get ready to move from the mortal season into an immoral season and our jay the incense was mixed with the prayers on the altar and received that before god this was this was typing out actually a representative of what god would have them do in the in the old testament which was shadows and they were pointing to this time and of course all these prayers those prayers of the end time prayers for vengeance upon those that had done wickedly to the saints of god prayers for the lord's return the last prayer of the bible you know what it is even so come lord jesus but it had to be put on hold because you were coming your name was in this map too come on hallelujah god knew you were coming and he said i can't come yet so i'll just come and i'll be interceding until the last name that is on the book is manifested displayed on the earth some of you we've been waiting a long time for you to get here amen but every time another son is born god says okay that's it there's another name now and then he says there's another name and i'm interceding for this one and for that one he's even interceding for your lost children for the prodigal that needs to come back home he is still interceding on the behalf of the redeemed those names that are in the book of redemption who must be dipped in blood and in our day incense was mixed with the prayers on the altar and they have been received up before god and god said okay to do this end time i'm going to send him a prophet now i've had him i've had him in the days of the voice or in the days of preparation but now will come the days of the voice we've not been preparing him with divine healing campaigns and miracles and signs and identifying i was with him and this the ministry of christ being displayed but now now there will be the lamb in heaven taking the book and loosen the seals and on earth i've got a messenger ready to receive it as he hands it down to the seventh angel on earth for the revealing of it because when it's mixed with the incident it's got to be brought down to the earth and it causes upheavals earthquakes took place some of you who were in tombs of religion amen it broke the seal of the tomb oh man and you came out some of you were in a baptist room some of you were in a methodist too some of you were in a pentecostal too but i tell you when the word came when the hour came for it to be fulfilled for there to be a resurrection denomilation hell could not hold you stretchers could not hold you formalism could not hold you the powers of satan could not hold you just says in the days of zechariah the father of john the baptist you know he went when he rose there now this tradition had been done for many years and typed out but one day it wasn't a tradition anymore one day he stepped right into the prophecy and he cares with him the prayers for the coming of the lord somebody with me cares but they had been praying for this messiah they had been calling on him to come they had been waiting for this hour but now all of a sudden everything looked just routine this is my time well you know i'm waiting on a child ah it's past it's been he's been coming i will never have that baby it's over she's passed even menopause has showed up we'll never have this baby it'll never come john had sunk down in the unbelief the church said we're surrounded by romans we can never have this messiah he'll never come we'll never have we'll never have him you had a pregnant woman the wife of john of zechariah the mother of john or to be the mother and you have a pregnant woman israel and they're both waiting and john walks in and when he does the silence is broken and when the silence becomes broken the angel speaks and says i'm gonna you're gonna have a son and he's gonna be the forerunner and this will be the start of the coming of the lord because there's got to be a forerunner come before the messiah can come and zechariah said i've been too long and i believe i can't believe it and god said okay shut your mouth i'm not going to let you speak such nonsense anymore shut up until it's fulfilled and then i'll open your mouth [Music] somebody's going to say to some of you that are sitting around and saying oh how can it be oh there'll never be nothing oh we're beyond those days it's all past i'm just saying shut up the angel in this pulpit says shut your mouth until god fulfills his word but he's going to bring forth a bride without spot without wrinkle who will finish the race [Applause] john when the angel appears to zechariah and announces the coming of john it starts a chain of events is like an atomic explosion that never stops i want you to know what started there has never stopped to this day come on it's still it's still like an atomic explosion just continue a chain of events that comes until it wraps up the end time are you with me now amen so you see the same in our day the church has looked for the return of jesus christ and for it and it's coming from mature church without spot or wrinkle and i just want you to know what has been silenced because he said seal up those voices of thunders and don't write them but because they're for an end time people i'm going to reveal some things to them and tell them where they are in time where they can have the faith to withstand in the evil day are you with me amen and the thing that the churches look for the return of jesus christ and is coming from a true church without spot or wrinkle what has been silenced and what has been wondered about here it's begun to happen and the breaking of the silence of the seventh seal somebody with me which reveals us voices of the thunders there that held the mystery of the symbols in the book were that we now are not wondering what are the symbols because it had to be written in the word but it was not understood that's what a thunder is is when god says something but it's not understood so we say it was a noise it was a thunder it was the voice of god but we don't know what it said but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound his mystery the mystery of god and he's speaking directly of the seven thunders and he said the mystery of god shall be finished in our day the season changes and the lamb there's actually movement in heaven that did that not happen in the first coming of christ heaven moved before something happened on earth amen there were angels visited zachariah and then and then mary and then joseph and then the shepherds and and heaven's opening heaven's revealing something heaven's letting us know there's something going on it's revealing us to us the christ come on and the same in our day at the return of jesus christ something starts happening in the heavens the lamb steps forth in heaven and when he does he initiates a change of seasons in revelation 5 and verse 5 and what are the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god to all the earth now we look in the symbols we know there's no you know if you've got an eighth age you're not part of the lamb if you've got an eighth messenger you're not part of the lamb oh today brother tim we got the eighth messenger it's the holy ghost you're not part of the lamb you say why why would you say that because anything other than these seven horns and seven eyes is not part of the lamb oh but we have an apostle today you're not part of the lamb we got another prophet today you're not part of the lamb oh you know in jeffersonville we have a new prophet you're not part of the lamb you have excommunicated and identified yourself as something else not part of the lamb amen because the lamb has seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god and you say well we got it's the holy ghost that's who he was seven spirits of god the spirit for every age the one holy spirit and seven manifestations poured out an anointing on the earth are you with me now now then but there stood a lamb as it had been slain now john in the book of revelation he is symbolic of the bride you know that the book of revelation is a symbolic book amen come on there's no there's no silver golden throne there like that we think of that as humans that's the way we picture there's no there's no book with that's leather bound with goat skins or lambskin or whatever skin the book is symbolic of the believers the book of revelation is symbolic john is even symbolically representing the redeemed he's one of the 12 elders of the new testaments and there's 12 elders of the old testament because it is in campus and encompassing the redeemed now so that's true the lamb that's had been slain and and of course there is no lamb like that in heaven with seven horns and seven eyes there is a man christ jesus who that was symbolic god are you with me and john in the book of revelation is symbolic of the bride and in the exhilaration of the moment john looks to see a lion amen he's looking for a mighty king stepping forth but it was not the millennium yet amen but redemption was still unfolding are you with me so he doesn't see a a lion at all he sees a lamb for the lamb is symbolic of his work as kinsman redeemer the sacrifice and the lamb is stepping forth the one who gave his life for us who shed his blood is stepping forth to claim the book and to loose its seals now he's a bloody lamb it will take blood to purge the transgressions of heiress that have kept the book sealed closed i want you i want to submit to you this book was not sealed closed in the days of paul it was the errors of the ages that sealed the book and closed it was the work of the antichrist that closed the book in the days of paul the book was open the mysteries were revealed we're not preaching a new message we're preaching the same gospel paul preached are you with me it's not a new message it's not an addendum to the book it's exactly what paul preached amen what did he say when he went beyond the curtain of time so whatever paul preached i preached it and heaven said we're resting on that amen you say well brother tim you see that was in 58 or 9 when you know 1960 when before the seals was open he had that experience and and he could say then i just preached what paul preached no that's when he moved from diamond to eternity and was being embraced by all the mothers over there and they said you preached what paul preached and said we're resting on that our resurrection rest um oh the gospel returning to what paul preached i'm submitting to you today we're not preaching a new message we don't have to be like the jehovah's witness and and reinterpret the bible we don't have to be like the mormons and that's the books amen brother branham what he said is not an addendum to the book a man it's not an addition to the bible it's the same gospel paul preached it's the same word and if so it was the same word because it did the same miracles in the same sign and the same oneness [Music] john sees the lamb not a lion not a mighty king to take the throne of david that season is close but not yet we'll have the millennium it's coming it's at least three and a half years away somebody help me preach a man at the very least is three and a half years away because there's there is the marriage supper of the lamb that takes place in heaven and tribulation on earth amen amen you can see you can visualize it the way i any way you want to but i look at it like this as we're celebrating in heaven and it's going to be a celebration nobody will be wearing an old robe it'll be a great youth camp are you with me amen we'll all be dressed alike in new clothes i'm gonna be showing mine off i'm gonna be dancing in mine i'm going to be shouting a lot in mind amen just hey man you see some people say you know that that's something they saying you know what well you know about i can only imagine and somebody said well they could that's all they could do is imagine i can do more than imagine amen i will be there amen i will be there and i don't know exactly if i'll dance but i probably will if i shout oh i know i will if i run around and around i know i will but i know when i see him [Applause] amen i might greet old brother paul and throw my arm around him i might read oh brother branham and see a young man there with a full head of hair and youth amen i might see brother jerry amen as he runs around and shows us how i can run now and i don't have to worry about breathing amen i may give him a big hug i'll even hug sisters there and they'll hug me come on amen and as we embrace one another looking at one another in our new clothes but when i see jesus [Music] it ain't gonna be some hug i'm gonna bow before the king of kings and lord of lord and worship him because he deserves everything amen he's my king he's my lord and i will bow before him and say i heaven said i would bow before you and here i am bound before you as i bowed before you on earth you were my king on earth and now you're my king as i kneel at your feet [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah the lamb in revelation 5 is a bloody lamb in the season chains we can see him it will take purge or blood rather to purge the transgressions of eras that have kept the book sealed and closed john sees the lamb he does not see a lion and if you're the true bride hear me now all around the world hear me if you see if you if you're the true bride you do not see a lion who is judged and angry and judgmental so that you can be haughty disrespectful and ugly in your judgmental ways no but when you see him if you're too bright you'll see a lamb amen amen amen not a mighty king to take the throne again of david that season is close but there must come forth first the season of the anointed messiahs amen and be and and then be the anointed one the book of title must be released back not to sons of adam but to the sons of jesus the second adam now by the opening of the seals she's been turned from all the traditions of man back to the true and original atonement by the opening of the books you can see that there's still blood and that that blood has never lost its power once upon once again there's a people on earth that can embrace and harness the power of the original atonement sickness is conquered come on somebody amen diseases are destroyed sin is vanquished and death is abolished remember because he's just as much lamb today as he ever was a matter this is what the opening of the book revealed not a bunch of head knowledge that but granting to us the contents of the book that he's the same yesterday today and forever why it had to be shepherd my friend brother caleb who's listened to me shared this with me this quotation listen and he said jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever it is that same lamb he's just as much lamb today as he was then he's just as much here as he was there hallelujah for his word is the same let me just read it again it's the same yesterday today and forever he's just as much the lamb today as he was then he's just as much here as he was there for his word is the same wherever two or three are gathered in my name there i am in the midst that's exactly what he said he never changes he still he's god the word and never changes now the lamb in revelation 5 is dismissing the claims against the book that was closed to us i want you to get that the lamb in revelation 5 is dismissing the claims against the book that kept it closed to us stop and realize where we're in time we're another season for thousands of years this book has remained in the hands of god but in this day there's been a change as a man has been found worthy to take the book out of the hand of him that sat on the throne and that was not william branham that was jesus christ notice he was taken back it has to be an abstract title deed in other words it has to be a clear deed there can be nobody from former ages where that they made a debt that is against the piece of property it must every debt must be annulled well that's what happened to you when you were born again you got an abstract that every listen that jesus paid every debt of sin that was against you and that you are free to serve the living god and god gave you an abstract no matter if your mother did it if your daddy did it no matter if you were born wrong well i was illegitimate hey all of us were illegitimate all of us was born wrong all of us was born in sin shaping an iniquity we needed a savior we need somebody to pay our debt amen he paid a debt he did not owe and we owed a debt we could not pay and now the holy ghost is your proof that the devil has no claim on you hallelujah it's your proof it's your proof that the devil has no claim on you so when the devil said this and the devil said that yeah but when i got an abstract every claim he had on my life if i smoked he had a claim if i drank he had a claim if i if i committed adultery he had a claim if i well if i used cocaine or drugs he had a claim and whatever it was he had a claim but the day jesus paid my debt [Music] he gave me an abstract and i have a clean title a perfect title i have a right to come before the throne of grace not as a sinner but as a child of the most high god i am redeemed and that through the churches in this hour she has redeemed every claim that the devil had against us that kept us from the possession of the book has been removed and the book is unsealed by the lamb because only his blood could redeem and remit the claims against us he had a claim satan had a claim on luther and that church satan had a claim on wesley and that church amen satan had a claim on azusa street and that church but i got some news for the devil [Music] the lamb has taken the book and loosed the seals and jesus took the blood his own blood and he wiped the claims against us off what luther did what wesley did what what as zoos as we did the mistakes that's been made along the journey and you have a perfect title and a clear claim to a rapture the devil cannot say you can you can be held back another age another time he can't say it the book has been cleared of its seals and it's now opened and that makes every one of you a messiah a possessor of the title deed that it all belongs to you as the children of god it's another season it's another season for thousands of years it remained in the hands of god but in this day there's been a change as a man who was worthy to take the book out of the hand of him sat on the throne that sat on the throne and he was to take it back it was to be an abstract title deed this book had been waiting for redemption claims abstract brother branham would say abstract what does that mean he said it means there's been a title search it means there's been a title search as property is handed down from one person to another there could be people and you could buy a nice piece of property and go go to possess it and all of a sudden find out that some man before him before you or two generations before had put a lien on this because he didn't pay a bill and he owed money and so there's a debt that that must be cleared before the title can be transferred and the book was held in the hands of almighty god somebody with me amen and it could not be transferred back to man because adam had sinned and sold us come on and then down to the ages here we have all of these things that's why every person has to have that abstract title deed which is the baptism of the holy ghost that that clears your debt personally i mean some of you are mixed up in your marriage some of you were engaged before some of you had of this this thing that you did and that thing you did this problem you had come on somebody you had all kinds of things that you had done listen when the devil accuses you he don't have to make up lies he'll tell exactly what you did [Applause] amen you you know you smoked you drank you committed adultery you were a liar he don't even have to make up stuff on you there are things you actually did he talked you into him he was deceived by by your first birth you were already married to to satan united with him sin nature dwelt in you this came because of your first birth you were called to begin with oh yeah you were a reject you didn't have a hope you were there without god there was no mercy for it i'm not talking about you know to i'm not talking to this one here that one there or somebody's got a prison record or this that's not what i'm i'm talking about every one of you from the righteous one of you to the one who did the worst of the worst kinds of sin you were everyone in this condition a man you were you were deserving of hell there was a debt you could not pay and you were going to debtors prison but god who is rich in mercy hallelujah in his love that he had for you amen when you were dead in sins and trespasses as he saved you and redeemed you out and set you free and now the devil can tell you can come along and you can tell him but you don't have no claim on me amen you have no shame on me there's no shame there's no blame amen you know little drew he heard that song saying the youth choir saying jeremy y'all gotta y'all gotta i don't know what marriage did to you amen about five of you lay hands on him right there i don't know what marriage did to you we got to get a song back in your heart again coming out jeremy's singing that song no shame on me you know drew little drew you know he he'd go around his mama say shame on youtube shame on you shame on you boy shame he heard that song and he laughed and looked at his mama and there ain't no shame on me let me hold my token up let me hold my closet [Applause] no shame no blame the devil don't have a claim of my life i don't belong to him i'm the son of god i'm a child of god hallelujah hallelujah there's no shame on me am i deceived with my king amen who was with darkness and that light in the lord hallelujah and the silence has broken on my life hallelujah and god said this is my son this day have i begotten thee and i found out i was always chosen and i can never be unchosen hallelujah i was always here and i will always be here he was always my father and he'll always be my father and the gates of hell will not prevail against us because when sins sucks the bleach of the blood it changes every attribute of sin and it puts it back on the head of the accuser now the devil's going to hell for my sin the accuser is bearing my sin the accuser's going to hell with my sin and i am redeemed i've been bought with the price i know who i am i know where i come from i am a messiah a messianic power with a clear deed and an open book and every promise in the book is mine [Applause] oh yes it's mine [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah
