[39:28] corinthians 10.
[39:30] amen it's always good to be in the house
[39:32] of the lord
[39:40] amen
[39:48] like to speak to you again on casting
[39:50] down imaginations
[39:52] the pulling down of strongholds ii
[39:55] corinthians 10
[39:56] and verse 3 said for though we walk in
[39:59] the flesh
[40:00] we do not war after the flesh for the
[40:02] weapons of our warfare
[40:04] are not carnal but mighty through god
[40:08] to the pulling down of strongholds
[40:11] amen we let you be seated today
[40:17] looking here at what paul wrote
[40:20] in the word of god it says the weapons
[40:23] of our warfare
[40:24] are not carnal in other words they're
[40:27] not
[40:28] merely human the weapons that we depend
[40:31] upon is not our human ability or our
[40:33] human nature
[40:34] or what we are born with as a human but
[40:37] the weapons that we are dependent on are
[40:39] mighty
[40:40] through god in other words they're not
[40:42] having they're not of the nature of
[40:44] flesh
[40:45] but they're in the nature of the
[40:46] supernatural
[40:48] they're not under the control of an
[40:50] animal appetite or human appetite or a
[40:53] human nature but they're under the
[40:55] control of the spirit of god
[40:57] all of our human efforts combined can do
[41:00] nothing against the powers of darkness
[41:03] but we are not relying on ourselves we
[41:05] are relying on our god
[41:08] amen these weapons are mighty in god
[41:11] amen mighty through god the word mighty
[41:14] actually
[41:14] translated they're dynamically powerful
[41:18] in other words these weapons he has
[41:19] given us he has supplied us with
[41:22] more than enough than we need to have
[41:24] victory in our lives
[41:26] amen we just have to tap into what's
[41:28] already available you know
[41:30] brother brandon would make this
[41:31] statement as a powerful statement he
[41:33] said any
[41:34] christian in here has a right to meet
[41:37] satan anywhere and defeat him
[41:41] hallelujah how many christians do we
[41:43] have here tonight
[41:44] any christians in here has the right to
[41:47] meet satan
[41:48] anywhere and defeat him on any grounds
[41:51] that he could ever stand on
[41:54] hallelujah the weapons that we use are
[41:56] not physical they're not
[41:57] tangible but our weapons are weapons of
[41:59] faith
[42:00] their weapon that's a whip our weapons
[42:02] that we use it is the word of god their
[42:05] prayer
[42:05] and even the weapon of worship it is
[42:08] right believing or believing right
[42:10] and they are mighty through god to the
[42:12] pulling down of strongholds
[42:14] that have tried to keep us bound now
[42:17] strongholds are places
[42:19] that the devil has tried to build to
[42:21] hold you
[42:22] strongholds are many times the results
[42:24] of wrong thinking or wrong beliefs
[42:26] that have taken root in our lives
[42:29] they're contrary to god's thoughts as we
[42:31] have heard the scripture says god's
[42:33] thoughts
[42:33] are higher than our thoughts amen our
[42:36] most are often
[42:37] inspired by the devil's lies lies that
[42:40] we have believed about ourselves
[42:42] lives that we believe about god lies
[42:44] that we believe about others
[42:46] and that that there gives a stronghold
[42:48] for the devil to hold on to your actions
[42:51] to your behaviors to your habits and the
[42:54] more strongly you believe these lies
[42:56] the stronger the whole now the whole
[42:59] stronghold
[42:59] doesn't just sit in your mind and do
[43:02] nothing no they produce
[43:03] actions they produce behaviors they
[43:05] produce habits they produce
[43:07] no matter what you try it seems
[43:09] impossible to get rid of them
[43:12] you know someone compared a stronghold
[43:14] one time as i was studying this
[43:15] i thought it was really good analogy it
[43:17] compared a stronghold to like being in a
[43:20] boat that is filling up with water
[43:22] and you can grab a bucket and you can
[43:24] work as hard as you want to to get the
[43:25] water out of the boat
[43:27] but the water is not the problem the one
[43:30] the problem is the hole in the bottom of
[43:32] the boat
[43:33] amen and many times strongholds is our
[43:37] problems and until you
[43:38] plug that or deal with that problem or
[43:41] that hole in your life or that hole in
[43:43] your thinking or
[43:44] or that hole in your actions or whatever
[43:47] you're going to keep getting water in
[43:48] the boat
[43:49] and all the hard work and all the
[43:51] efforts in the world will not get the
[43:53] water out
[43:54] but the hole in the bottom of the boat
[43:56] is what the real problem is
[43:58] now you know we we you can try really
[44:01] hard to get rid of the behavior like the
[44:03] water you know
[44:04] i don't like being this way i don't want
[44:06] to be this way but it just keeps coming
[44:08] back
[44:09] amen it keeps coming back and it keeps
[44:11] coming back
[44:12] you know it was very strange here last
[44:14] sunday uh
[44:15] thoughts as i was singing here at the
[44:17] end of service
[44:18] the lord began to deal with me about
[44:20] peace and you know
[44:21] people want peace all the time
[44:23] especially in the world that we live
[44:24] here
[44:25] but many times in situations people want
[44:27] god to change the situation
[44:29] instead of god changing them amen and
[44:33] that's what we're dealing with is the
[44:34] boat the hole in the boat it's
[44:36] you know the water's still there the
[44:38] trouble still there the problem's still
[44:39] there
[44:40] the situation's still there but god i
[44:42] need you to change me
[44:44] amen many times peace is not a magical
[44:47] moment
[44:47] where all of a sudden all the
[44:49] surroundings change and we have peace
[44:51] the greatest peace is god's peace
[44:54] and that peace surpasses all
[44:56] understanding in other words when you
[44:58] can't understand why you're in the
[44:59] situation
[45:00] why you're going through this you can
[45:02] still have peace when you can't
[45:03] understand why
[45:04] am i this way you can still have peace
[45:06] or why am i dealing with the situation
[45:09] or the circumstances
[45:10] you can still have peace in other words
[45:12] this peace transcends the emotions
[45:15] and the circumstances but you know too
[45:17] many times we are not careful we are
[45:19] worshiping
[45:20] our emotions or our state and giving it
[45:23] more importance than
[45:24] god or others amen we're not dealing
[45:27] with the hole that's in the boat
[45:31] you know honestly these you know uh
[45:35] we we won't we won't change but
[45:38] what you have to change is what you
[45:40] believe
[45:42] and what your thoughts are upon and what
[45:45] your thinking
[45:46] is and you know as the bible says as you
[45:48] think in your heart so you will be
[45:50] many if not all people have strongholds
[45:52] in their minds
[45:53] that hold them in the bondage by the way
[45:55] they think
[45:56] and there's many strongholds that we
[45:58] could deal with tonight there's
[45:59] strongholds of addiction and
[46:01] strongholds of anger and strongholds of
[46:03] fear and
[46:04] strongholds of loneliness and
[46:06] strongholds of rejection
[46:08] strongholds of unforgiveness or jealousy
[46:11] and the list goes on and on
[46:13] and you can see people allow these
[46:14] things to become really predominant in
[46:16] their lives
[46:17] to where even like a stronghold of of
[46:20] unforgiveness to where they can't even
[46:21] gather with family no more
[46:23] they can't even be in somebody's
[46:25] presence why because there's a
[46:26] stronghold there
[46:28] and and they want the situation to
[46:29] change but they won't deal
[46:31] with the hole that's in the bottom of
[46:32] the boat amen you know
[46:35] and and so we got to realize that
[46:37] whatever we think
[46:38] as david would say in the psalms he said
[46:40] all your precepts concerning
[46:42] all things i consider to be right
[46:45] but i hate every false way
[46:49] and i believe that's what we got to come
[46:50] to is when we realize god's word is
[46:52] first as we've been preaching on this
[46:54] we got to put god's word in this proper
[46:56] place
[46:58] that when it comes to our thinking or
[46:59] our ways or whatever
[47:01] we're willing to submit ourselves and
[47:02] say god i'm not the right
[47:04] person i'm not right in this situation
[47:06] your word is right
[47:08] amen and i hate every false way
[47:11] so every way that i have that don't line
[47:14] up to the word of god
[47:15] is a false way you say well i was born
[47:19] this way or i
[47:20] i this is the way i am this is just if
[47:22] it does not line up
[47:23] with the word of god it's a stronghold
[47:26] it's a false way
[47:27] and david said i hate every false way
[47:31] hallelujah he is acknowledging one god
[47:34] is
[47:34] always right about everything
[47:37] hallelujah he is right about marriage he
[47:40] is right about money
[47:41] he is right about our family he's right
[47:44] about forgiveness
[47:45] he's right about bitterness he's right
[47:47] about everything you can put there
[47:49] anything you can think of god is right
[47:53] amen he also said i hate every false way
[47:56] every idea
[47:58] every reasoning anything i think or do
[48:01] that's contrary to the word of god i
[48:03] hate it
[48:06] see lives can imprison you and therefore
[48:08] defeat you
[48:11] and we have to turn down the lie of
[48:13] satan
[48:14] eve didn't turn down satan's lie they
[48:17] brought death to the human race and
[48:19] if you don't turn down satan's lie it's
[48:21] going to bring death to you
[48:23] amen but what happened with mary she
[48:25] accepted the word of god
[48:27] and it brought forth life amen we must
[48:30] rely
[48:31] not upon our abilities but upon our
[48:33] weapons that god has given us
[48:36] amen and use them against the enemy
[48:38] knowing it's not our strength
[48:40] it is his strength it's not our
[48:42] abilities it's his abilities
[48:44] it's not my waltzes his wants it's not
[48:47] the way i've desired is his desire
[48:49] it's everything about him his way is the
[48:52] way i want
[48:55] hallelujah this is what he would say in
[48:57] ephesians 6 and verse 10
[48:59] he says finally my brethren be strong
[49:02] where
[49:03] well i got a strong nature that's not
[49:04] where you to be strong in
[49:06] i know many times we rely upon our
[49:08] god-given now our natures our human
[49:10] natures
[49:11] amen but that's not what we're to be
[49:13] strong in to be
[49:14] strong in the lord and in the power
[49:17] of his might amen the scripture said
[49:20] it's not by might
[49:21] nor by power but by his spirit
[49:24] amen an amplified it would say it like
[49:26] this in conclusion be
[49:28] strong in the lord be empowered by your
[49:32] union with him
[49:35] this is the power that a christian draws
[49:37] from this is what gets him to the
[49:39] deepest of valleys and
[49:41] and what gets him to the greatest of
[49:42] sorrows it's not who i
[49:44] am it's who he is it's not me that
[49:47] doesn't it's the father that does it in
[49:49] me
[49:51] hallelujah amen let's be strong in the
[49:54] lord be empowered
[49:56] through your union with him draw your
[49:58] strength
[49:59] from him
[50:02] hallelujah i know people draw their
[50:05] strength from a good
[50:06] a good uh something that happened you
[50:08] know well this happened over here that
[50:10] and testimonies and those things are
[50:11] wonderful
[50:12] but no matter if there's never another
[50:14] testimony we draw our strength from him
[50:17] hallelujah put on god's whole armor
[50:20] the armor of a heavy armed soldier which
[50:23] god supplies
[50:25] that you may be able to successfully
[50:27] stand up against
[50:28] all the strategies and the deceits of
[50:31] the devil
[50:32] for we are not wrestling with flesh and
[50:34] blood we're not continuing
[50:36] continuing contending with a physical
[50:38] opponent
[50:39] but against principalities against
[50:41] powers
[50:42] against the rulers of this present
[50:44] darkness against the spirit forces of
[50:47] wickedness
[50:48] in heavenly or supernatural spheres
[50:50] therefore
[50:51] put on god's complete armor that you may
[50:54] be able to resist
[50:55] and stand your ground in the evil day of
[50:58] danger
[50:59] and having done all the crisis demand to
[51:02] stand
[51:02] stand firmly in your place and don't
[51:05] give it back don't step back an
[51:07] ounce or an itch hallelujah
[51:10] hallelujah stand therefore hold your
[51:13] ground
[51:14] and having tightened the belt of truth
[51:16] around your loins
[51:17] and having put on the breastplate of
[51:19] integrity
[51:20] and a moral amen responsibilities and
[51:23] right standing with god
[51:25] and having shod your feet in preparation
[51:28] to face the enemy with full firm
[51:31] footed stability and promptness and a
[51:35] readiness that's produced by the gospel
[51:37] of peace
[51:38] lift up over all the covering shield of
[51:41] the saving faith of almighty god
[51:43] upon which you can quench all the
[51:45] flaming missiles of the wicked one
[51:47] take the helmet of salvation and the
[51:50] sword of the spirit
[51:51] and wield it which is the word of god
[51:54] pray at all times
[51:55] at every occasion in every season oh
[51:58] hallelujah
[51:59] amen in the spirit with all manner of
[52:02] prayer and entreaty to that
[52:04] end keep alert and watch with strong
[52:07] purpose
[52:08] and perseverance amen this is what we're
[52:10] to do
[52:11] god has given of himself all of these
[52:14] are weapons of the spirit
[52:17] amen and this is where he tested them
[52:18] all out jesus when he came
[52:20] filled with the holy ghost he was
[52:22] tempted in all manner
[52:23] he tested every weapon and he tried
[52:26] everything and he realized
[52:27] it works it'll hold through every
[52:29] temptation
[52:30] it'll hold in the middle of the storm
[52:32] it'll hold in sickness and trouble
[52:34] when family leaves you and sitting and
[52:37] everybody walks away
[52:38] it'll hold when your closest friends
[52:40] walks away in a hole
[52:44] hallelujah when people defect it'll hold
[52:48] he's tested it over and over and he gave
[52:52] of himself
[52:53] he gave us a spirit amen to pull down
[52:56] strongholds
[52:57] not to let those strongholds hold you
[53:00] hallelujah he's got examples all through
[53:02] the bible of pulling down strongholds
[53:05] jericho was a stronghold but god didn't
[53:08] let it stand
[53:09] he tore it down amen listen god is in
[53:12] the business of taking down strongholds
[53:17] god is in the business of of rewriting
[53:20] lives and
[53:20] rewriting situations to where it don't
[53:23] even hold you no more
[53:28] his spirit is here to lead in god
[53:33] he came in the flesh to do what to
[53:36] destroy
[53:37] the works of the devil
[53:42] it came to put himself in your battle
[53:48] this is where paul is talking to me he
[53:49] said look be strong
[53:51] in the lord the weapons of our war for
[53:54] our
[53:55] warfare are not carnal but mighty
[53:57] through god
[53:59] amen what is he saying he's showing a
[54:01] union there that it's not just you and
[54:03] you alone
[54:05] i know satan loves to get people out and
[54:07] you're all by yourself and nobody cares
[54:09] listen god's with you
[54:13] jesus is with you amen
[54:17] this is what happened with the great
[54:18] triumphant general that's what he said
[54:20] taking the whole armor of god
[54:22] came down and was the word made flesh
[54:25] he took that word and he defeated satan
[54:29] on every ground he took the word and he
[54:32] said you destroy this temple
[54:34] and i raised it up in the third day why
[54:36] david in the word and said i'd suffer my
[54:38] holy one not to seek corruption
[54:40] neither will i leave his soul in hell he
[54:42] knew that that was one promise of god
[54:45] he would be raised up and he took that
[54:48] word
[54:48] and went to death with it knowing that
[54:52] the word
[54:53] would come to pass in his body and raise
[54:56] him up again
[54:58] hallelujah and there's not one word of
[55:00] god's promises
[55:02] that will not come to pass he said
[55:04] heavens and earth will pass away
[55:06] but my word will never fail every
[55:09] promise is perfect
[55:11] [Music]
[55:12] and on one promise in the scripture he
[55:15] stood
[55:16] and went to death on one promise
[55:20] oh hallelujah amen on one promise can we
[55:23] not stand
[55:24] and go into eternal life
[55:31] jesus knew corruption set in the body
[55:33] after 72 hours the nose falls in
[55:36] begins to stink david said by the holy
[55:39] ghost a man
[55:40] inspired the word of the lord coming to
[55:42] the prophet said i'll not suffer him to
[55:44] seek corruption
[55:45] he knew before one cell could corrupt he
[55:48] would be up out of the grave
[55:50] he was the word fortified by the word he
[55:52] rose up
[55:53] and he conquered death hell and the
[55:55] grave and himself came back in the form
[55:58] of the holy ghost
[55:59] to fortify his army for this last day
[56:04] for this last day this big onslaught
[56:07] where there'd be great intellectual
[56:09] giants rising up
[56:10] reasoning against the word of god but
[56:13] the promise said i'll not leave you or
[56:15] forsake you
[56:16] but i'll be with you and i will not
[56:18] leave your comfortest but i'll come
[56:20] again
[56:20] and i'll be with you even in you to the
[56:22] end of the world
[56:25] hallelujah so we're not in the boat
[56:28] alone
[56:30] listen we got a god who's in the boat
[56:32] fixing business
[56:34] let me go down for a minute i heard this
[56:36] song today
[56:38] and it just it just spoke to me it was a
[56:41] charles johnson
[56:44] singing at him and the revivers
[56:48] this course says jesus is with me when
[56:51] the storm clouds gather
[56:54] he's standing by my side when i hear the
[56:57] thunder roll
[56:59] he holds my hand when i begin to tremble
[57:03] when the winds of this world are blowing
[57:05] strong
[57:06] and i believe we'll see if we're feeling
[57:08] the winds of the world blowing
[57:11] jesus is offense around his children
[57:15] his grace is sufficient enough to stand
[57:17] the storm
[57:18] his word is a promise we can stand on
[57:21] when the winds of this world are blowing
[57:23] strong
[57:25] satan is moving to and fro throughout
[57:27] the land
[57:28] seeking whom he may devour but he was
[57:30] defeated at golgotha
[57:32] that day when jesus made him out to be a
[57:35] liar
[57:38] satan is always sneaking around the gate
[57:40] trying to lead a sheep astray
[57:42] but he that is in us is greater than him
[57:46] so then we rebuke him and chase him away
[57:50] if you're caught up in the winds of the
[57:52] world with no joy in your life
[57:54] at all just give your heart to jesus
[57:56] he'll
[57:57] always understand and he'll never let
[57:59] you fall
[58:00] jesus is with me when the storm clouds
[58:03] gather
[58:05] hallelujah this is what paul was trying
[58:07] to get a hold of
[58:08] go get a hold of our minds to let us
[58:10] know in the storm
[58:12] he's with you in the battle he's with
[58:15] you
[58:16] in disease he's with you in situations
[58:18] of life
[58:19] he's with you he'll never leave you or
[58:22] forsake you
[58:23] jesus is with me
[58:28] who do you think you're wrapped around
[58:30] who's wrapped around you when you put on
[58:32] the armor of god
[58:35] it's not our creeds it's not our dogma
[58:37] it's it's not our religion
[58:40] it's the weapons of god
[58:43] amen but he said that he
[58:47] gave us this for the great
[58:50] onslaught of the great intellectual
[58:54] giants
[58:55] that would be raising up at the last day
[59:00] intellectual giants it says days of
[59:02] miracles are passed
[59:04] intellectual giants it says there's no
[59:07] such thing as divine healing no more
[59:09] intellectual giants it says mercy's over

[59:17] making these decrees and
[59:19] they're calling it out and saying

[59:28] ghost power can't
[59:29] keep listen there's intellectual giants
[59:31] in this message they're saying
[59:33] the holy ghost can't keep you no more
[59:37] it's a mess it's intellectual giants
[59:41] that people have raised up in their own
[59:43] thinking and own vain imaginations
[59:45] and begin to see things the world the
[59:47] word has never said
[59:50] and begin to decree things and and begin
[59:52] but he said but
[59:53] in these times i'm not going to leave
[59:55] you comfortless
[59:57] but i'm going to be with you hallelujah
[1:00:01] he said i pray to the father he'll send
[1:00:02] another comforter which is the holy
[1:00:04] ghost this is what the armor of god
[1:00:07] is it is the holy ghost
[1:00:10] hallelujah you cannot use the word of
[1:00:12] god without the holy ghost
[1:00:14] you cannot use a shield of faith without
[1:00:17] the holy ghost
[1:00:20] he said to pray in the spirit the holy
[1:00:23] ghost
[1:00:27] the word god's great artillery artillery
[1:00:30] in a human being
[1:00:31] manifesting the resurrection think of it

[1:01:04] already conquered it hallelujah he's
[1:01:08] conquered

[1:01:12] giant
[1:01:13] he's conquered both death hell
[1:01:16] and the grave he's conquered every
[1:01:18] atmosphere
[1:01:20] [Music]
[1:01:21] oh hallelujah and he ascended on high
[1:01:24] but he didn't stay there

[1:01:28] ghost and now

[1:06:43] was the chief himself
[1:06:46] he had a hose in one hand and an axe in
[1:06:48] the other and he said let her go
[1:06:51] and they pulled the lever who went first
[1:06:54] the fire chief
[1:06:56] when it hit up against the wall he took
[1:06:58] that axe before the ladder got against
[1:07:00] the wall
[1:07:00] and he slammed it through the window and
[1:07:02] he said come on boys
[1:07:04] let's go put this fire out and he said
[1:07:07] that's exactly what christ
[1:07:09] done the word come living in a human
[1:07:12] being
[1:07:12] and he took a hose and an axe and he
[1:07:14] conquered the death
[1:07:16] hell and the grave and he said come on
[1:07:18] now i'm with you
[1:07:21] you're not in this war though i'm with
[1:07:23] you

[1:07:28] the fire i'm with you in the water
[1:07:30] i'm with you in every situation don't
[1:07:32] forget who's with you
[1:07:34] [Applause]
[1:07:38] great conqueror he said we don't need
[1:07:41] great intellectual denominations
[1:07:44] well i belong to the biggest church in
[1:07:45] this nonsense
[1:07:48] it ain't even i belong to the littlest
[1:07:50] one i belong to the one
[1:07:55] i've been in he said i've been in the
[1:07:56] branham family for 53 years
[1:07:58] they didn't ask me to join the family i
[1:08:00] was born at branham he said that's the
[1:08:02] way you're a child of god
[1:08:03] you're born a child of god by the new
[1:08:07] birth
[1:08:08] and where do we get away from that it's
[1:08:11] like brother adam will say i can tell
[1:08:12] you where he put it in it you tell us
[1:08:14] where he took it out
[1:08:17] we're not born by believing a message
[1:08:21] that's only a start
[1:08:25] have you received the holy ghost since
[1:08:27] you believed
[1:08:29] well we've gotten away from that gotten
[1:08:31] away from preaching the holy ghost god
[1:08:32] it's like it's some kind of old folky
[1:08:34] idea it is the idea
[1:08:37] it is all of the idea if you don't get
[1:08:40] that you miss the whole boat
[1:08:44] if you don't get that you don't even
[1:08:45] have boat you're sunk
[1:09:00] he said many times he began to talk
[1:09:02] about the armor
[1:09:05] he said why is a nation providing all
[1:09:08] this protection and
[1:09:10] training and and and all the
[1:09:13] and he said they put this 90-something
[1:09:15] pound pack on this 90-something pound
[1:09:17] man
[1:09:18] low started sweating to death does it
[1:09:20] really work
[1:09:21] really we really got to go through all
[1:09:23] of this we you know he starts
[1:09:25] complaining
[1:09:26] he said but when he gets in the battle
[1:09:29] then he'll appreciate all of that
[1:09:32] he said wait till the battle comes
[1:09:36] he'll appreciate what's all in his pack
[1:09:41] you know many times we get aggravated
[1:09:42] with what we're going through
[1:09:45] god's training us for something we get
[1:09:48] mad at god we get angry oh i'm not mad
[1:09:51] at god we'll check your attitude
[1:09:57] because we allow it to overtake us and
[1:10:00] we allow it to be our stronghold
[1:10:03] to where that's all we can think eat
[1:10:06] sleep anything about
[1:10:09] it's a stronghold
[1:10:14] god knew that this time would come
[1:10:18] he knew the time that we would be living
[1:10:20] in and all the
[1:10:21] intellectual giants that are spouting
[1:10:22] out their nonsense and
[1:10:24] he knew the kind of enemies we'd be
[1:10:26] facing with the trying to reason the
[1:10:27] power of god out of the church and prove
[1:10:30] that days of miracles are passed and
[1:10:32] prove god don't do that no more
[1:10:34] so what does god do he packs his church
[1:10:37] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:10:39] this is a prophet of god speaking in
[1:10:42] tongues interpretation of tongues
[1:10:43] prophecy gifts and all kinds of things
[1:10:45] they may seem hard in the training but
[1:10:47] in the battlefront
[1:10:48] every one of them's got to be used
[1:10:52] god equips his soldiers exactly what it
[1:10:54] takes for the battle
[1:10:56] they might say well just learn
[1:10:57] psychology just learn just be
[1:10:59] you know he said that's thinner than a
[1:11:00] broth made of a shadow of a chicken
[1:11:02] that's half starved of the earth
[1:11:03] there's no that's no good we have to
[1:11:06] have
[1:11:07] the power of the holy ghost coming
[1:11:10] upon a man
[1:11:13] hallelujah you said i just don't like to
[1:11:15] get out i just don't like to pray
[1:11:17] i just don't like we got to have the
[1:11:20] power
[1:11:21] of the holy ghost coming upon a man
[1:11:31] he said if you don't like it you're
[1:11:33] going to get killed in the battlefront
[1:11:38] you're going to be a defector
[1:11:41] oh no i'll never do peter didn't think
[1:11:45] he would either
[1:11:46] judas when he first started walking with
[1:11:48] god he didn't think he would either
[1:11:51] amen he said you stay there
[1:11:54] until a god equips you with the baptism
[1:11:57] of the spirit
[1:12:00] and then everything you've got need of
[1:12:02] in this world or the world to come
[1:12:04] is in you right then the always god
[1:12:06] knows how to equip his army
[1:12:08] he equips it with the best thing the
[1:12:10] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:15] mercy he knew that people would reason
[1:12:18] it would go to reading this word when it
[1:12:20] come out in print out here and what
[1:12:21] would happen
[1:12:23] hello somebody oh they could then now
[1:12:26] find get a message search and
[1:12:27] follow and follow him and realize he may
[1:12:29] he said this here and he said this over
[1:12:31] here
[1:12:31] they got mistakes over here and they
[1:12:32] begin to reason reason reason really
[1:12:34] till they talk themselves right out of
[1:12:35] it he knew it would happen
[1:12:38] he knew there was going to be people
[1:12:39] that would do all of that and bring all
[1:12:41] their
[1:12:41] their fake trials against the prophet of
[1:12:43] god he knew all of that
[1:12:45] amen so what does he equip you with
[1:12:48] not with more reasoning not with a
[1:12:50] greater intellect than what they got
[1:12:52] he and he he equips you with the
[1:12:55] greatest power
[1:12:56] ever known to the man of any man that
[1:12:58] ever has lived on the face of this earth
[1:13:00] it is the power
[1:13:01] of the holy ghost that'll hold you
[1:13:05] in your greatest trial
[1:13:08] because it held him
[1:13:14] he said we knew he knew it would come to
[1:13:16] where people say where is the god of
[1:13:18] history
[1:13:19] where's the god that crossed the red sea
[1:13:21] and opened it up
[1:13:22] where is the god that healed the sick
[1:13:29] god knew it would take the baptism of
[1:13:33] the holy ghost
[1:13:34] to prove his later latter day signs
[1:13:38] he knew it would have to be to be an
[1:13:40] effective witness
[1:13:43] oh hallelujah he knew what it was going
[1:13:46] to take
[1:13:48] he knew what it was going to take to
[1:13:49] hold you in the fire
[1:13:51] he knew what it was going to take to
[1:13:52] hold you in the middle of the storm
[1:13:54] he knew all about it so he gave us the
[1:13:57] best there is
[1:13:58] satan knows that reasoning and what
[1:13:59] reason and powers there are
[1:14:01] and where it lays the power of reason
[1:14:03] and and so he knows what it is to come
[1:14:05] against you in the mental
[1:14:07] uh capacities but god doesn't fight him
[1:14:09] with your mental capacities
[1:14:11] he fights him with the spirit
[1:14:23] he says listen this he equipped his army
[1:14:26] with the holy ghost to do those things
[1:14:29] talking about to be effective with
[1:14:31] witness to be
[1:14:32] uh to show the signs he equipped his
[1:14:36] people with the baptism the holy ghost
[1:14:38] to do those things
[1:14:39] to make the secrets of the heart known
[1:14:41] as he promised
[1:14:42] you can't do that with any kind of
[1:14:44] training you can only do it by the
[1:14:46] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:14:48] the armor of god and this is the evening
[1:14:50] light to make
[1:14:51] hebrews 13 8 a reality it would make
[1:14:54] take more than a training
[1:14:56] you can read words you can read words
[1:14:58] you can read words it'll never make it
[1:15:00] come to pass
[1:15:01] until you have the holy ghost in there
[1:15:02] to manifest it
[1:15:05] that's the light put it on the whole
[1:15:08] armor of god
[1:15:09] not just to dress only or dress up and
[1:15:11] say glory to god
[1:15:12] i got the holy ghost you're spurting all
[1:15:14] the power out of the whistle
[1:15:15] you're doing no good put it in action
[1:15:18] put it in faith
[1:15:19] make it move make it do something
[1:15:21] putting on the whole armor of god to go
[1:15:23] out and withstand the wiles of the devil
[1:15:27] and the tear down is strongholds
[1:15:40] it's what he would say in romans 8 and
[1:15:42] verse 5
[1:15:43] for they that are after the flesh do
[1:15:46] mind the things of the flesh
[1:15:48] but they that are after the spirit the
[1:15:50] things of the spirit
[1:15:52] for to be carnally minded is death
[1:15:57] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:16:00] peace
[1:16:01] because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:16:03] against god
[1:16:05] for it is not subject to the law of god
[1:16:07] neither indeed can be
[1:16:09] for then they that are in the flesh
[1:16:11] cannot please god
[1:16:13] but ye are not in the flesh but in the
[1:16:16] spirit oh hallelujah
[1:16:18] if so be that the spirit of god dwell in
[1:16:21] you
[1:16:22] you're not in the flesh if the spirit of
[1:16:24] god dwells in you
[1:16:27] now if any man have not the spirit of
[1:16:29] god christ
[1:16:30] he is none of his and if christ be in
[1:16:33] you the body is dead because of sin
[1:16:35] but the spirit is life because of
[1:16:37] righteousness but if the spirit of him
[1:16:40] that raised up jesus from the dead
[1:16:42] dwelling you
[1:16:43] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:16:45] shall also quicken
[1:16:47] your mortal bodies by his spirit
[1:16:50] that dwelleth in you
[1:16:53] hallelujah it's not by our mental
[1:16:56] capabilities
[1:16:57] it's by his spirit
[1:17:01] it's not how good we can put quotes
[1:17:03] together it's by his spirit
[1:17:06] this is why paul says i do not come to
[1:17:08] you with word
[1:17:10] words of man's wisdom and enticing words
[1:17:12] of man's wisdom i come to you
[1:17:14] in power and demonstration of the spirit
[1:17:17] of god
[1:17:18] listen people got it all wrong they
[1:17:19] think it's something just to get up and
[1:17:21] give a little flowery speech
[1:17:22] and the goods that make us feel a little
[1:17:24] good listen i ain't interested in a
[1:17:25] flowery speech
[1:17:29] amen for that matter obama was a good
[1:17:31] speech maker but i'm not interested in
[1:17:33] that
[1:17:34] i'm not interested in a good speech i'm
[1:17:37] interested in the demonstration
[1:17:39] of the power of the holy ghost that when
[1:17:41] i see there
[1:17:42] i know god is there
[1:17:46] when i see lives changed i know god is
[1:17:49] there
[1:17:54] you know one of the greatest testimonies
[1:17:56] of this church
[1:17:57] is not it's sitting on highway 371 with
[1:18:00] a sign out front
[1:18:01] it's not it's rock pillars and it's a
[1:18:03] nice carpet and
[1:18:05] beautiful piano beautiful pews that were
[1:18:07] donated
[1:18:08] that's not the greatest sign one of the
[1:18:10] greatest signs of this church
[1:18:12] being a living breathing body of christ
[1:18:15] is there's young people sitting there
[1:18:17] hungry for the word of god
[1:18:20] one of the greatest signs of a church
[1:18:22] being a dead church
[1:18:24] is the young people ain't hungry they're
[1:18:25] not growing they're not moving on
[1:18:29] they're going into things of the world
[1:18:31] i'll never forget when this man and
[1:18:33] woman sat there and said
[1:18:34] you know what they come from the baptist
[1:18:37] they tried to come become a message but
[1:18:39] they just only become baptist methodists
[1:18:42] matt baptist message but they said one
[1:18:45] of the greatest things that testified to
[1:18:47] us about your church
[1:18:48] was that our church it was only 60 year
[1:18:51] old and up that's about all that's there
[1:18:52] young people are gone
[1:18:54] but we came to your church there's young
[1:18:56] people that's worshiping god
[1:18:59] there's life there
[1:19:04] hallelujah i want to be where life's at
[1:19:08] praise the lord amen i want to be where
[1:19:12] the spirit of god can move and convict
[1:19:14] and
[1:19:14] and move upon hearts and change them
[1:19:18] hallelujah oh my this and i want to get
[1:19:21] to this for a moment
[1:19:22] because there is a power you know the
[1:19:23] power it's not a temporary power
[1:19:27] hallelujah you know you come to come to
[1:19:30] church tonight in the car how many come
[1:19:31] in a car or a truck vehicle
[1:19:34] nobody come and horse a buggy i don't
[1:19:36] think but anyway
[1:19:37] car and truck everybody came in there
[1:19:39] enjoyed that nice
[1:19:40] that nice um heat
[1:19:44] and maybe some windshield wipers i don't
[1:19:46] know if it was raining or whatever
[1:19:48] enjoyed that keeping the elements off of
[1:19:49] you but that car
[1:19:51] and this power is temporary
[1:19:55] it bottle like last till the pavements
[1:19:57] are done
[1:19:59] if you're lucky that's right they they
[1:20:02] i think they make them that way you used
[1:20:04] to you can get a washing machine
[1:20:06] last 30 years and they decided you know
[1:20:07] that's a bad idea
[1:20:09] they last that long they won't ever come
[1:20:11] back and buy another one so they make
[1:20:12] them last just a certain length that's
[1:20:13] what they do
[1:20:15] parts are made out of plastic from china
[1:20:17] and everywhere else and they put it all
[1:20:19] together
[1:20:19] it's only temporary
[1:20:23] it's only a temporary thing but what you
[1:20:26] have the holy ghost is not temporary
[1:20:30] and something that's temporary is also
[1:20:32] limited
[1:20:34] your car has a limited horsepower it has
[1:20:36] limited abilities
[1:20:37] it can go only a certain distance
[1:20:39] without being refueled
[1:20:41] it has limitations it it can only cool
[1:20:43] so much in the hottest of summer it can
[1:20:45] only heat so much
[1:20:46] in the coldest of winter it has
[1:20:48] limitation but you
[1:20:50] do not have a power in you that is
[1:20:52] limited
[1:20:53] you do not have a power in you that's
[1:20:55] temporary or or
[1:20:57] it is eternal this is what paul said in
[1:21:00] hebrews 7 and verse 10 14 he said
[1:21:02] for it is evident that our lord spring
[1:21:05] out of judah
[1:21:06] which is the tribe moses spake nothing
[1:21:08] concerning priesthood
[1:21:09] and it is yet far more evident for that
[1:21:12] after the similitude of melchizedek
[1:21:14] there arises another priest who is made
[1:21:18] not after the law of a carnal
[1:21:20] commandment but after the power
[1:21:22] of an endless life well that's what
[1:21:25] power i'm talking about
[1:21:27] and that power of endless life has made
[1:21:30] you
[1:21:32] oh hallelujah amen you can tell that a
[1:21:35] power
[1:21:36] that made the car a car is limited it
[1:21:38] has limitability so it had to be a
[1:21:40] limited power
[1:21:41] that made a limited creation well come
[1:21:44] on now
[1:21:45] but this power's not limited and if it
[1:21:47] made you
[1:21:48] kings and priests it didn't give you a
[1:21:50] limitation
[1:21:51] it said your love your kings and priests
[1:21:54] over every spirit
[1:21:55] over every ruler of darkness over every
[1:21:58] power
[1:21:58] over every depression over every anxiety
[1:22:01] you
[1:22:02] have been made rulers
[1:22:06] hallelujah the devil is limited
[1:22:11] oh hallelujah the devil is limited
[1:22:14] amen he was created
[1:22:23] he didn't create him to destroy
[1:22:27] he was created as an angel of light
[1:22:32] but he was given a choice and he made
[1:22:35] the wrong choice
[1:22:38] and here now he's destined for
[1:22:40] destruction
[1:22:43] you know it's kind of it's kind of a
[1:22:46] humorous to me to think about the devil
[1:22:49] he laughs at me i like laughing at him
[1:22:54] but to realize he's limited
[1:22:58] to realize he's like my car
[1:23:02] he has an end
[1:23:08] that ought to put some some joy in some
[1:23:10] hearts tonight
[1:23:12] when you realize that depression has an
[1:23:13] end
[1:23:15] that sickness has tormented you has an
[1:23:18] end
[1:23:23] and he a limited being is trying
[1:23:26] to defeat something that's unlimited
[1:23:30] that's just how stupid the devil is
[1:23:35] but you have been made
[1:23:38] kings and priests you have been made
[1:23:42] rulers he
[1:23:45] hath made us i didn't make myself that
[1:23:48] he made me this
[1:23:52] there are certain truths you brother
[1:23:54] brown said you have to emphasize
[1:23:56] he made us
[1:23:59] salvation is his doing
[1:24:02] all of his grace all of his power he
[1:24:05] redeemed us for a purpose
[1:24:07] he brought us here for a purpose as
[1:24:09] kings
[1:24:10] over a spiritual kingdom we're going to
[1:24:13] be kings upon the earth with him but now
[1:24:15] we rule as spiritual kings we reign over
[1:24:18] a spiritual kingdom
[1:24:20] we reign with christ having dominion
[1:24:23] over sin amen that's what the holy ghost
[1:24:27] does for the believer
[1:24:28] it gives you a dominion over sin
[1:24:31] therefore
[1:24:32] sin does not rule you no more you rule
[1:24:35] sin
[1:24:37] if real sin is still ruling you then you
[1:24:39] don't have a dominion
[1:24:40] you don't have the holy ghost but if if
[1:24:43] you are the ruling over
[1:24:44] sin the world the flesh and the devil
[1:24:47] that's the dominion
[1:24:48] that christ has given us showing forth
[1:24:50] his praise and glory showing forth
[1:24:52] himself
[1:24:53] for it is christ in us willing and doing
[1:24:56] his good pleasure
[1:24:57] he has made us kings and priests
[1:25:05] to the christian today how many
[1:25:06] christians
[1:25:08] the victory is one
[1:25:13] you need to look at that stronghold and
[1:25:15] say the victory is one
[1:25:17] [Applause]
[1:25:19] just like joshua would look at jericho
[1:25:21] and he said the victory
[1:25:22] is one before one wall came down before
[1:25:26] one stone crumbled before one little
[1:25:29] motion was made
[1:25:30] the victory is won
[1:25:33] amen and when the victory is won the joy
[1:25:35] bells are ringing
[1:25:37] why the victory's won in order to
[1:25:39] conquer and win the greatest battle
[1:25:41] that's ever won
[1:25:42] he stepped out of glory and he took on
[1:25:46] human flesh
[1:25:47] he didn't come in a form of an angel he
[1:25:49] didn't come as a great person
[1:25:51] he came and he didn't take on muskets
[1:25:53] and bullets and
[1:25:54] atomic bombs he clothed himself in
[1:25:56] humanity
[1:25:57] like a little baby born in a manger in a
[1:26:01] manure pile
[1:26:04] stink rotten flesh
[1:26:09] human flesh
[1:26:15] look at the different material of
[1:26:18] warfare
[1:26:21] human flesh he chose to do battle with
[1:26:25] satan
[1:26:28] he could have done battle as god that's
[1:26:30] right
[1:26:31] spoke him right out of existence
[1:26:34] but he chose to do human battles
[1:26:38] as a human oh my
[1:26:42] so he would know what it's like to hold
[1:26:44] his head with a headache
[1:26:46] he would know what it's like for his
[1:26:47] body to swell he would know what it was
[1:26:49] like for blood to run down and
[1:26:51] these sores and cankers he would know
[1:26:53] what it's like
[1:26:55] to go through all temptations he would
[1:26:58] know what it was like to face mind
[1:27:02] battles
[1:27:08] he would say he destroyed this temple
[1:27:11] but in three days i would
[1:27:12] he was satan such great anointing but as
[1:27:15] a human
[1:27:16] he would have mind battles
[1:27:21] just like you
[1:27:29] adam's race was in bondage
[1:27:32] without hope without a chance
[1:27:35] without mercy without anything that
[1:27:38] could help them
[1:27:39] the great enemies of the lower regions
[1:27:41] of the law should shut them up in
[1:27:43] darkness
[1:27:44] and there was not a way out there was no
[1:27:46] one that could help him
[1:27:48] nothing could be done it looked like a
[1:27:50] total
[1:27:51] complete loss
[1:27:54] but our hero came down from the portals
[1:27:58] of glory
[1:27:59] for there was no man on earth that could
[1:28:01] do the job they were all
[1:28:03] worldly speaking in the same boat amen
[1:28:07] they were all born in sin shaped in
[1:28:09] iniquity coming to the world speaking
[1:28:11] lies
[1:28:12] none of us could help each other we
[1:28:14] stood helpless
[1:28:15] defeated chaos on every hand we couldn't
[1:28:18] keep the simplest of laws and ceremonies
[1:28:21] finding weaknesses we had them it seemed
[1:28:23] like the whole human race
[1:28:25] was going to be wasted
[1:28:29] but he came because he was in the
[1:28:32] beginning the bible said he was the word
[1:28:34] and he descended down and the word
[1:28:37] became
[1:28:37] flesh and was dwelt among us he was the
[1:28:41] word
[1:28:42] and the word became the intercessor and
[1:28:44] the word became flesh
[1:28:46] the same flesh that was in the world
[1:28:48] receivable in glory
[1:28:49] now the high priest make an intercession
[1:28:51] he knows
[1:28:52] what it's like he knows what
[1:28:56] it's like to go through those battles he
[1:28:59] knows what it's like to face
[1:29:00] loneliness he knows what it's like to
[1:29:03] face fear
[1:29:04] and anxiety he knows all about it
[1:29:08] as god he couldn't know
[1:29:16] that's the material the church got
[1:29:20] what a weapon he was the word
[1:29:24] born in a manger he came to use the
[1:29:27] weapon to conquer the world
[1:29:28] not army bullets not machine guns not
[1:29:31] tanks
[1:29:32] a different manner he came in the form
[1:29:34] of love
[1:29:37] he came to conquer he came to put the
[1:29:40] devil under his feet
[1:29:42] he came to conquer hatred
[1:29:45] and if you've got christ in you hatred
[1:29:47] is conquered
[1:29:51] he came to conquer bitterness and if
[1:29:53] you've got christ in you
[1:29:54] bitterness is conquered come on now
[1:29:58] he came to conquer unforgiving and if
[1:30:00] you've got christ in you unforgiveness
[1:30:02] is conquered
[1:30:06] come on if you don't if it's still
[1:30:08] eating at your fl eating at your flesh
[1:30:10] and
[1:30:11] tormenting your thoughts and all that
[1:30:12] it's not conquered therefore you don't
[1:30:14] have christ
[1:30:17] you got holes in your boat amen
[1:30:27] christ come to conquer he come to love
[1:30:31] those that were unlovable
[1:30:33] he came with a different sort of weapon
[1:30:36] he humbled himself made himself lower
[1:30:38] than the angels we're in the christmas
[1:30:39] season
[1:30:40] to suffer death to give us an example
[1:30:43] and when he was here on earth he walked
[1:30:45] among men he proved
[1:30:47] his weapon of warfare could heal the
[1:30:50] sick
[1:30:53] he proved it could feed 5 000.
[1:30:56] he proved he had a power greater than
[1:30:58] any atomic power
[1:31:00] he proved that he could amen that he
[1:31:02] could get water from the
[1:31:04] not only did he could he get water from
[1:31:06] a well he made wine
[1:31:07] out of that water he proved he had power
[1:31:10] to conquer
[1:31:11] he proved he had power over the grave
[1:31:13] when he walked to lazarus grave and
[1:31:15] lazarus had been stinking for four days
[1:31:17] and and skin worms were crawling through
[1:31:19] his body and he said did i not say to
[1:31:22] you if thou canst believe all things are
[1:31:23] possible
[1:31:24] and he said well my brother's dead he
[1:31:26] said he's not dead he's just sleeping
[1:31:28] i am the resurrection of the life he
[1:31:30] that believeth in me though he were dead
[1:31:32] yet shall he live hallelujah
[1:31:34] he only ma he never only made a
[1:31:36] statement but he also was able to carry
[1:31:39] out that statement
[1:31:40] and make it manifest among them why
[1:31:43] because of the power
[1:31:45] that was inside of him it was a power
[1:31:49] of endless life
[1:31:53] dwelling in him veiled in human flesh a
[1:31:57] man
[1:31:58] but inside dwelt none other than the
[1:32:00] almighty god
[1:32:02] the great mighty one he could create
[1:32:06] he could create new things he could
[1:32:08] speak and it would happen
[1:32:10] he could curse and it would be so and he
[1:32:12] humbled himself
[1:32:13] he stayed low he wanted to give an
[1:32:15] example
[1:32:17] he wanted to be the right kind of
[1:32:18] conqueror
[1:32:21] come on now he wanted to be there i want
[1:32:23] to be a cocker
[1:32:24] we want to be the right kind of
[1:32:25] conqueror
[1:32:33] a woman would argue with brother branham
[1:32:35] as we bring this down
[1:32:37] he was just a man he said you want to
[1:32:39] make him deity but he was just a man
[1:32:43] you try to make him too great
[1:32:46] he said lady there's no words
[1:32:49] that could express his greatness and how
[1:32:52] great he truly was
[1:32:56] well as john would write and he said if
[1:32:59] it was
[1:33:00] if it all was told of all the miracles
[1:33:02] and things that happened
[1:33:04] it couldn't hold it the books couldn't
[1:33:05] hold it
[1:33:10] well you he was nothing but a man maybe
[1:33:12] a prophet but a man
[1:33:13] he was god he said you make him deity
[1:33:17] was not
[1:33:18] he wept as he said well that was just
[1:33:20] the heart of god he was flesh
[1:33:22] he bore in his body the same desires
[1:33:25] and things we do but yet to become the
[1:33:29] perfect sacrifice he had to do that
[1:33:33] he said he wept he was just a man
[1:33:36] it was a man when he was weeping but
[1:33:39] when he stood back and he straightened
[1:33:40] them shoulders up
[1:33:42] and he said lazarus come forth that was
[1:33:44] more than a man
[1:33:46] because corruption knew its master
[1:33:50] there was a power of endless life
[1:33:52] standing there
[1:33:53] to break the strongholds that was
[1:33:55] holding lazarus oh hallelujah
[1:33:57] this is what the holy ghost does for you
[1:34:00] it comes into your life not for you to
[1:34:02] live with the devil
[1:34:04] it comes into your life so you can
[1:34:06] overcome the devil
[1:34:08] so you can rise above the devil amen it
[1:34:10] comes to you to make you greater
[1:34:12] than the powers that hold you greater is
[1:34:14] he that's in me than he that's in the
[1:34:16] world
[1:34:22] corruption newest maker
[1:34:27] he said oh you're talking about beating
[1:34:28] the dish pans and blowing the horn
[1:34:31] the world ought to be in a jubilee like
[1:34:33] never has been the screams and shadows
[1:34:36] of his people
[1:34:37] because in this memorial day that he
[1:34:40] conquered
[1:34:41] the last enemy and set
[1:34:44] us captives free
[1:34:49] oh yes he was a man but he proved
[1:34:51] himself to be god
[1:34:52] when he stepped on the brow of the boat
[1:34:54] he was sleeping as a man but on the boat
[1:34:56] he said peace be still and the winds and
[1:34:58] the waves obeyed him true
[1:35:00] he hungered like a man when he came down
[1:35:02] but when he took those five fish
[1:35:04] and five biscuits and two fish and fed
[1:35:07] five thousand
[1:35:08] he was more than a man hallelujah he
[1:35:10] proved
[1:35:11] his last th of his messiahship when he
[1:35:15] broke the bands of
[1:35:16] death and he raised from the grave and
[1:35:18] said i'm alive forevermore
[1:35:20] there's the comforter the conqueror
[1:35:22] you're talking about jerking off the
[1:35:24] aprons and waving it around
[1:35:26] people say we're crazy because we shout
[1:35:28] because we run because we scream because
[1:35:30] we holler
[1:35:31] they've never felt the victorious
[1:35:34] vibrations of heaven
[1:35:37] that the battle is over
[1:35:40] it's conquered he's already conquered
[1:35:43] for me
[1:35:44] it is over and he stands alone this
[1:35:47] morning
[1:35:47] as the mighty conqueror
[1:35:56] he made a highway where there was no
[1:35:59] highway
[1:36:00] where satan had blocked it off
[1:36:04] he talks about the highways the first
[1:36:06] line of doubt demons of doubt
[1:36:09] then prejudice and then the next was
[1:36:11] selfishness
[1:36:13] the earth covered over with lines of
[1:36:14] demon power sickness and diseases
[1:36:18] but he arose into heaven overcoming
[1:36:20] every one of them
[1:36:22] and he broke every power the devil
[1:36:25] holds over man
[1:36:29] did you hear me church of the living god
[1:36:31] he broke
[1:36:32] every power that the devil's ever held
[1:36:35] over man
[1:36:38] and in between and between him and and
[1:36:41] every believer is the blessed old
[1:36:42] highway of holiness that the righteous
[1:36:44] can walk
[1:36:46] and a way of escape has been cut to
[1:36:49] glory
[1:36:50] and we're going up that highway and
[1:36:53] while we're going his people are having
[1:36:55] a jubilee
[1:36:57] tens of thousands of them around the
[1:36:59] world are shouting the victory
[1:37:00] he says when the first world war is over
[1:37:03] the message coming down the road
[1:37:05] what's all the noise about the war is
[1:37:07] over the war is over
[1:37:08] what's all the noise about the wars of
[1:37:11] over he said
[1:37:12] oh brother i'm here to tell you it's
[1:37:14] already done
[1:37:16] the conquering's already done the
[1:37:18] enemy's already defeated
[1:37:20] what's all the shouting about my enemies
[1:37:22] defeated
[1:37:24] what's all the shouting about my
[1:37:26] sickness has been taken care of
[1:37:27] what's all the shouting about my
[1:37:29] depression has fell off of me
[1:37:31] what's all the shouting about
[1:37:38] my god's victorious
[1:37:41] and he's given the victory to me
[1:37:45] and he said it takes this blessing old
[1:37:47] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:37:50] to guide you up this highway without it
[1:37:53] you're not walking amen
[1:37:57] and in this power is the power over
[1:38:00] every sickness
[1:38:01] in this power is the power over every
[1:38:04] stronghold
[1:38:05] in this power is the power over every
[1:38:07] over death
[1:38:08] in this power is the power over every
[1:38:10] grave
[1:38:12] and it won't be long those graves are
[1:38:13] going to come back up again and open up
[1:38:16] and
[1:38:17] those dead in christ is going to rise
[1:38:19] and we're going to go to meet him
[1:38:21] why are we shouting why do we rejoice
[1:38:23] why do we weep people say what's the
[1:38:25] matter of them
[1:38:26] what's the matter i know it's finished
[1:38:29] he's already done it
[1:38:31] he's already paid the price it's all
[1:38:34] over
[1:38:38] it's as good as done the glory
[1:38:42] and the power of god is made known
[1:38:47] it's a finished work
[1:38:51] so if it's a finished work why would we
[1:38:54] let a stronghold hold
[1:38:56] us
[1:39:00] what what happened what changed with
[1:39:02] joshua
[1:39:04] what changed with the the the hebrew
[1:39:06] children
[1:39:08] or the children of israel they crossed
[1:39:09] that jordan river
[1:39:12] they begin to look at jericho in a
[1:39:15] different light
[1:39:16] once they looked at them as giants and
[1:39:18] walls too high
[1:39:20] and impossible situations but god wants
[1:39:24] to change your view
[1:39:26] and your thought when you see jericho
[1:39:29] i see a defeated foe when i see cancer
[1:39:34] i see a defeated foe when i see spirits
[1:39:37] that wants to rise up and
[1:39:38] i see a defeated foe
[1:39:41] change your look at satan he's defeated
[1:39:46] his power ends
[1:39:54] it is the power of endless life
[1:39:57] that breaks strongholds
[1:40:03] it's unlimited
[1:40:18] you know the stronghold you've allowed
[1:40:19] to rise up in your life
[1:40:28] it's a defeated thing if you'll
[1:40:31] recognize it
