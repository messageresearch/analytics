thankful lord you're in our boat lord you're with us father you're with us to meet our needs according to your riches in glory we praise you god we thank you in jesus name amen and amen hallelujah let's turn to deuteronomy 20 and verse one amen it's good to be in the house of the lord amen how many loves him tonight amen deuteronomy 20 and verse 1 says when thou goest out to battle against thy enemies and see his horses and chariots and a people more than thou be not afraid of them for the lord thy god is with thee which brought thee out of the land of egypt and it shall be when you're come nigh unto the battle that the priests shall approach and speak unto the people and say unto them hear o israel you approach this day into battle against your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not do not tremble neither be ye terrified because of them for the lord your god is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you hallelujah we'll let you be seated this evening i'd like to pull from verse 3 let not your hearts faint fear not do not tremble neither be ye terrified because of them you know i was just going through the bible as we and my wife have been reading the bible chapter by chapter i read this some days ago and it's been on my heart and actually was trying to go some other places tonight but been kind of on this thought of the lord fighting for us or our faith for the battle and i know we are in the midst of a all-out assault from hell sicknesses on every hand and spirits that are rising up greater and more than ever before seems like but you know israel looking at this you know israel would be outnumbered many times in the battle because they were just set out set out as slaves come out of egypt coming through the wilderness and a lot of them had died off and a lot of them had and then god had raised up another generation so there was there was many times they were outnumbered there was no doubt many times the enemy was better equipped or more highly trained or or or been in more battles and more had more opportunities to uh kind of understand the war or how to war but you know god was showing them in this scripture it wasn't dependent it never depended upon their strength and never depended on how well equipped they were it all depended upon him what mattered was he was with them amen what didn't matter is if they could match up with the enemy what mattered is god was with them what didn't matter is if they had horses or chariots or or they had many enough men what mattered is that god was with him it was the same god that brought them out of the land of egypt it was the same god that was bringing them into the promised land and they were not even to look at the numbers of the enemy they were not even to look or count the horses or count the chariots or count how many men there was because it didn't matter what the number was it didn't matter how many chariots there was it didn't matter how impossible it looked what mattered was god was on their side amen they were to look at their god even though it may look hopeless and no way of victory and no way of escape that didn't matter what mattered is their god fault for them amen and in joshua he would he would once again remind them he said have not not commanded thee be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee whithersoever thou goest so it didn't matter if joshua was in a valley it didn't matter if joshua was on a mountain it didn't matter how many stood before him it didn't matter how innumerable it was it didn't matter if their number was as the sands of the sea it didn't matter if it was it seemed impossible to have a victory the enemy it didn't matter how great the enemy was or their capabilities that didn't matter it was but it was it isn't it wonderful to realize that the enemy don't matter [Laughter] hallelujah amen is it wonderful to realize satan don't matter sickness don't matter cancer don't matter brain bleeds don't matter sin don't matter what matters is there's a blood that's greater than any sickness what matters is there's a blood that's greater than any sin what matters is god is on our side that's what matters amen what matters is not how high the waves are how how tumultuous the sea is what matters is he is in our boat amen you know i could see you know joshua as he as he would even stand there some years even before this and he would stand up as it were on a soapbox and he'd begin to proclaim the promises of god because he had seen what the promises that god had given them of the land flowing with milk and honey and that's all that mattered to him as he seen the fulfillment of what god promised so he knew if god had fulfilled the promise and showed him and told him of a land flowing with milk and honey he'd put his eyes upon it then what mattered it god had showed them that god had produced it and god was able to give it to them and so what that what didn't matter was the opposition it didn't matter that jericho had walls so thick it didn't matter how high the walls was it didn't matter how many people was in the walls what mattered god had given them the land god had given them the promise and i want you to understand tonight it doesn't matter how hard the sickness may seem or how incurable the sickness may seem or how impossible to get over it may seem what matters is there is a blood what matters is there is a word for your deliverance what matters that he is more than able yet more than amen a is able for your need so that's where we stand here this morning brother adam would say he'll say it like this this is what where the church of the living god stands are you ready to know where you stand it doesn't he said i don't care what anyone says so it don't matter what anybody says it doesn't matter what the devil said the devil had many times decreed things over your life it was many times you decreed you was going to be a drunk or you decreed that you was going to be a homosexual he decreed all kinds of things about you but that didn't matter what matters what god said about you what matters is what god thinks about you what matters is god amen he said this is where the church of the living god stands he said i don't care what anybody says what the doctor says what an unbeliever says we are more than a match for anything that comes along well praise the lord anyhow we are more than a match for anything that comes along so whatever comes along don't matter what sickness comes along don't matter what sin comes along don't matter what power of satan comes along it don't matter how many the enemy can gather it don't matter how much he can gather out of hell and bring into this dimension it don't matter what matters is we are more than a match [Applause] hallelujah god has given them a promise where abraham's seed and we will possess the gate of our enemy no matter what the enemy is oh hallelujah i hope you got your shouting shoes on your joys shoes on whatever amen because i want you to understand what matters is healing is your possession what matters is salvation is your possession what matters is the holy ghost is your possession it don't matter that maybe thousands of preachers are preaching across the land and says it ain't so but the the seed of abraham says it is so and they weighed right in and possess the gates of the enemy why because god said they would and that's all that matters god said you would be victorious and that's all that matters god said you would be alive and remain and that's all that matters god said you're not born for hell you're born for another dimension and that's all that matters amen the devil tried to take you down and the devil tried to destroy your life but he don't matter what matters is god's voice in your life hallelujah hey many thousands of preachers can say it ain't so but they don't matter come on now amen the enemy can say whatever he wants to but that don't matter oh sure we'll go through trials and we'll go through testings and joshua stood there that little fella he said i don't care how big they are i don't care what kind of spear they got how high the cities are walled how great they are what matters is this is our land given to us by promise oh hallelujah and we are going to take them and we're more than a match oh hallelujah listen this bride of jesus christ is more than a match for any sickness that comes along because it's not us our strength we're dependent upon joshua was not dependent upon history caleb's strength or all of israel's strength he was dependent upon what the word said and that's all that mattered i know the world is trying to kill the voice of god and say it don't matter no more and the bible don't matter and the things of the world word don't matter but it does matter it's the only thing in this world that does matter hallelujah and his word will always matter to the seed of abraham what god says will always matter to the seed of abraham amen what the word of god says it's the final voice it's the final say it is the absolute and an absolute is all that matters this is five five kings came against joshua it didn't matter joshua 11 verse 4 says they went out they and all their hosts with them much people read this with me much people even as the sand that is upon the seashore is in multitude so that's a bunch of people in other words it was impossible to stand out there and count them all i mean i've heard them count twenty thousand thirty thousand in the bible fifty thousand hundred thousand maybe but this was as the sand upon the seashore with horses and chariots very many it didn't matter and when all these kings were met together they come and pitch together at the waters of maryland at the fight against israel and the lord said unto joshua now this is what matters be not afraid because of them for tomorrow about this time i will deliver them to you all slain before israel [Music] that's all that matters oh hallelujah amen together the devil wants to put something upon you and and gather his forces as the sands of the sea but it don't matter he can bring five kings 10 10 kings 15 kings whatever he wants to bring it don't matter what matters is about this time tomorrow hallelujah about this time i'm going to come and they'll be all slain before you that's all that matters and you will hew their horses or hamstring their horses or make them inoperable and burn their chariots with fire oh come on now let's just go ahead and have a cancer burning service let's go ahead and have a devil burning service let's go ahead and get ready for the victories of almighty god to fall in our lives because it's not what the devil says that matters he might have said you've got cancer but it don't matter what matters is he said i'm the lord god that heals all thy diseases that's all that matters hallelujah i'm telling you this dropped in my heart in the back back there to let you know what matters i know the devil's trying to put it out their spirits are coming out this matters this matters this don't matter that what matters is what god said ii chronicles 21 and it came to pass after this also that the children of amen or moab and of amen and others besides the amorites or ammonites who came against jehoshaphat to battle didn't matter and there came some that told jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against the from beyond the sea on this side syria and behold they be amen whatever that word is and jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the lord and to proclaim a fast throughout all judah and judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the lord oh hallelujah he knew where his help came from and even out all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord and jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of judah and jerusalem in the house of the lord before the new court and said oh lord god of our fathers art not thou god in heaven and rule us not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen amen let's go to who really matters the one who rules over everything amen it ain't a government it ain't going to the king of israel it ain't the king of israel knew he wasn't he didn't matter enough he didn't have enough he wasn't able on his own but he said let's go to who matters and in thy hand is there not might or power and might so that none is able to withstand thee or not thou our god oh yes who did us drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people israel and gave it to the seed of abraham thy friend forever and they dwelt therein ever built their sanctuary then for thy name saying if when evil cometh upon us as the sword judgment pestilence famine we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in our affliction then thou will hear and help and now behold the children of amen and moab and mount seir which sab did us not let israel invade when they come out of land of egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not behold i say how they reward us to come cast us out of that possession which thou has given us to inherit oh our god will thou not judge them for he we have no might against this great company that cometh against thee neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee and upon jehaziah came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation hear what matters hearken ye o judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and be thou king jehoshaphat thus saith the lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by the reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods hallelujah tomorrow go down against them and he told them where they were at the cliff as is and you'll find them at the end of the brook before don't you know your god knows where your enemy is the enemy ain't paul knows he might pull a surprise on you and sucker punch you every once in a while but god knows exactly where he's at amen he might hide from the doctors he might hide from signs he might hide from your own abilities but he cannot hide from god and you shall no need fight in this battle but set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the lord fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the lord will be with you moab's company and amites and bugits whatever they were they didn't matter he might have not been at a number of them but it didn't matter assyria didn't matter their king didn't matter in 2nd chronicles 32 1. the king of assyria came and camped against defense cities and thought to win them for himself that's what the devil thought he's going to do he thought he's going to win you for himself and he came in and camped against you and this week no doubt he sent this one against you and that one against you what's he trying to do win you for himself but there's already a word spoken over you hallelujah and when hezekiah saw that santa careb was come and that he was purposed to fight against jerusalem who took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city and then it helped them so they were gathering much people together who all stopped all fountains and brooks and said why should the king of assyria come and find much water also he strengthened himself and built up the wall that was broken raised it up to the towers and another wall without and replied repaired mellow the city of david and made darts and shields in abundance and he said captains of war over his people and gather them together and the street of the gate of the city and speak comfortably to them saying be strong and courageous be not of fear afraid nor dismayed for the king of syria for he don't matter nor his multitude that's with them for they don't matter for there's more with us than with him hallelujah let me speak comfortably to you tonight there's more with you than there's against you amen there's more that's fighting on your side then the devil could ever gather this all of its forces of hell god's got more we saw it time after time the devil don't have enough for with him is an arm of flesh but with us is the lord our god to help us and to fight our battles and the people rested themselves upon the words of hezekiah king of judah god is with us let not our hearts faint fear not do not tremble neither be ye terrified the greatest thing though enemies god is fear and he tries to bring it upon the people of god because he'll try to tell you whether his disease is known as incurable well there's no such thing as an incurable disease when it comes to god when it comes to god the same brother daryl ward him and his family had been struck down by this coven and he put out a little post he said i don't know who started this thing but i know who can stop it he wasn't talking about the government either either he was talking about isaiah 53 by my stripes you are healed that is a word that'll stop the devil amen the sickness that is attacking you in his tracks nothing the devil can do matters he don't matter what matters is god is with us he hadn't brought us to 2020 said good luck no he's with us he said he would be he promised it and we've listened to all these promises down to the bible and god came on the scene and performed them he don't look at the enemy you look at me i'll take care of the enemy oh hallelujah maybe somebody needs that tonight don't look at the enemy look at him he'll take care of the enemy he'll take care of that old lousy devil that's trying to come against you and cause you to have fear amen i've seen people come under this disease of covet and cancer and every kind of disease first thing the devil tries to do is get put fear on them this is going to take your life well devil have you not heard i'm a christian so that's well that's good that's not that's not nothing to fear that's a graduation party that's entered into the presence of the king of kings and the lord of lords what have i got to fear amen but he wants to come by and put fear on you you know brother branham in absolutely he had this he told this occasion he says i heard i heard one morning i woke up and heard a voice speaking in the corner and i looked and there was this hideous thing standing there at the bed accusing he said sometime before i'd seen a big mamba running snake trying to come after a brother he's trying to kill people and he's after my brother and i screamed out oh god what can i do and he said you have been given power to bind him be of good courage oh hallelujah i spoke to him and his tail went up in the air and whirled around like a pitcher handle and choked himself to death blue smoke flew out of him but this next morning when i woke up i was laying there and i said i better get up take the children to school and i looked over and there was this hideous thing looking like alley-oop out of the front of papers great big horn sticking out it sounded like a hen cackling or singing like it was going to the bar and i thought wow i said i kind of tried to wake my wife and i thought well that'll probably scare to death and i just sat there a minute and watched he said people talk about devils and don't even know what they are sometimes but you run into them every day and after a while he started accusing me and he started saying you have no power with god you're just a bluff you have no power ain't that amazing he tried to put fear on him try to bring fear into his life right off the bat amen a prophet of god who had stood in the pulpit and defeated devil after devil after devil after devil by the word of god and he's trying to tell him you don't have no power this is what he does to children of god it don't matter how many has been healed of cancer you get cancer and the devil tell you well it was for them but it ain't for you and trying to bring fear upon your bring dread upon your life and bring things upon you and they said you have no power and i said satan you are an offense to me get out of my way in the name of jesus christ and he left man that's what some of us need to do tonight the devil's been warned against you all week saying you ain't got no power you ain't got no hope you ain't gonna make it it's impossible satan you are offense to me get out of my way in the name of jesus christ i laid there a little bit as after he left and i felt this real sweet feeling come over me and the holy spirit drawing close he said so help me hear the bible over my heart the sweetest voice i ever heard in my life said don't fear to go anywhere don't fear to do anything for the never failing presence of jesus christ is with you wherever you may go he said well that was for brother brethren no it wasn't it's for every child of god because he said i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world so don't fear to go anywhere don't fear to do anything for the never failing oh hallelujah that's what matters the never failing presence of jesus christ is with you whether you're in walmart whether in your car whether you're at home whether you're in church whether you're on the job he's with you no matter where you may go you may feel like tonight you're walking through hell god is still with you you may feel like you're walking to the valley of the shadow of death he's still with you he promised he would and that's all that matters oh hallelujah why don't we just throw up our hands for a moment say thank you god for being with me if it had not been for the lord that's on our side where would we be if it wasn't for amazing grace it's a god who matters a god who can come and change a in just a moment you don't believe that he can come from glory this evening and set any one of you free he said well the walls too high don't matter the jailhouse is closed don't matter the door is shut don't matter come on somebody he can come to any one of you tonight and set you free he said well i'm in a prison well good he's good he had jailhouse breakout he's done it before he can do it again he came in the middle of the night when paul and silas was in the middle of the inner part of the prison and jailed and and enthroned and striped and beaten and every kind of thing but that didn't matter i want you to understand tonight how you feel don't matter we go so much on our feelings we lift our feelings above the word of god but our feelings don't matter our flesh don't matter what we think don't matter what matters is what god does and it didn't matter how bad saw paul and silas felt it didn't matter how deep there was in the prison it didn't matter how far it seemed impossible and beyond this door and this door and this door it didn't matter god was greater than the prison god was greater than the guards that carted them god was greater than the stocks and the bar bound all the things that bound them god was greater and that's all that mattered [Applause] oh hallelujah amen i don't care if you're sinner tonight and you seem so far away from god i heard from them this week amen crying out voices crying out i'm so far from god

middle of a prayer line and and he heard the words of the prophet speak and all of a sudden healing went down through his lungs what was it it was god making a house call [Applause] that's all that

no gate of the devil can stop him there ain't a gate of man that can stop him not a gate of the devil at gates of hell cannot prevail he'll walk past every one of them he'll walk past the gate of fear he'll walk past the gate of anxiety he'll walk past the gate of sin he'll walk past it all to get to that soul he said i'm so happy to know he's my refuge he's my strength he's a very present help in the time of trouble brandon would tell the story and you've heard it of him being up there on the mountain and the storm coming and he got lost got turned around and he got he thought he said i thought i was a guide he said i thought i knew what i was doing he said but i began to walk in a circle what the indians call the indian death walk and he said i began to walk right around said i had head off in one direction come right back to the same tree so i thought i couldn't get lost anywhere i got instincts enough to know where i am at all times he said but god has to take you off your feet sometimes to let you know that you don't know and we have to depend on him listen we can't depend on a miracle cure we can't depend on a vaccine did you hear me i know some of you waiting on the vaccine we can't even depend on that we can only depend on this we have to depend on him god lets you get that way to take you off your feet i know some of us was thinking year 2020 whoo-hoo it's going to be a great year now you see memes of sliding down a slide on razor blades all kinds of things but it might end up being a great year hallelujah what god wants you to get to where you have to depend on him you're just dependent on your 401k you're just dependent on your job you're just dependent on all kinds of things god wants you to depend on him he is all that matters and here he had his family way back there in a little cabin little wife and little billy little baby so they'd just die in just a few moments if i couldn't get to him in the storm because she wasn't a woman of the woods she didn't know how to take care of herself out there and said i was on this death walk walking in a circle fog so low there was no markers or nothing and i seen i was caught i said well i have to take some course i i have to do the best i can and i i'd start off walking one way and i couldn't already see as far as the wall and these great trees are swaying the wind blowing and like what can i do lord i begin to think lord you know my wife she's young and lean to almost zero weather baby boy of mine now freeze to death she's scared to death on these wilderness 25 miles from any road and said i i know she's scared to be there alone mountain lion she's seen this morning scared of that i know what i know i got to get to her and i started moving and i but i knew i was all mixed up i didn't know which way would to go i didn't know where to go but in the middle of it all i kept hearing something in my ear saying i am the lord and i am a very present help in the time of trouble oh hallelujah but the devil's trying to get you to think the fog matters and the storm matters and the trees matter and this matters but what matters is what he's saying in your ear i am the lord can you hear him say it tonight i am the lord and i am a very present help in the time of trouble i shook himself as he come back to the same place something get kept telling me the baby's gonna perish the wife's gonna perish you're a parish he said if my wife wouldn't have been there i just found me a place to hole up somewhere till the storm passed by maybe a day or two then went out but my wife was in the woods and i'm just worried and i keep walking but at the same time i keep hearing a voice saying i'm the lord i'm a very present help in the time of trouble i heard it again i said let me just lay my rifle down i pulled off my hat and i said heavenly father i'm no woodsman i was mistaken i can't do nothing without you i'm lost i'm absolutely lost he said you don't know what a feeling it is till you get lost one time i said father i'm lost i know i'm going wrong i don't know which way to turn there's only one way to turn and that's to you he gets you to a spot to where you have to depend upon him have you ever thought about that maybe this is what this is all about to get his bride to a spot you have to depend upon me i'm praying lord that you'll help me get out of here so i raised up weeping took my hat off shook it wiped the snow off so now to the best of my knowledge i'm going to go this way and he said he grabs his gun and he starts haul going this way and as he's walking he feels a hand on his shoulder and he pulls him around and said when he turned around the clouds had broke and there was hurricane mountain right there where he was supposed to be going hallelujah there i knew where hurricane mountain was the tower was and where the tower was a lifeline was and i knew here i was going to the best of my thinking i was holding myself the best i knew how and going the wrong direction but god said i am the lord i am the very present hell and he grabbed a hold of him and he turned him around and he got a glimpse of hurricane mountain oh hallelujah how many of you thought well i'm going to go this way and you're something pricked your heart to say there's a god and god is a really real and i want him more than anything else and i'm going to go this way and all of a sudden he grabbed a hold of you and he turns you around and you've got a glimpse of not hurricane mountain you got a glimpse of mount calvary and at mount calvary you saw the atonement that was made by his stripes i'm healed by his stripes i'm saying and i'm going to go with all my heart towards that mountain with my hands lifted in the air giving praise to god till i get a hold of that lifeline cause he's a very present help in the time of trouble you know good and well they ain't one of us would be sitting here tonight if it wasn't for that hand on our shoulder [Applause] you know good and well you wouldn't have the thoughts that you think of the heart that you have if it wouldn't have been for their hand there i went through the dark now all of a sudden nothing else mattered the wind didn't matter the fog didn't matter the trees didn't matter his thoughts didn't matter nothing william branham didn't matter all that mattered was there's a life line let me hold my hands in the air and praise him until i hit that lifeline let me thank him for what he's done till i hit that lifeline oh hallelujah maybe tonight you come in here with all things like all kinds of things in your mind that you thought really mattered but i hope you hear the word of god tonight none of that matters what you think don't matter what you feel don't matter what you what you believe in the thing that that what you believe to be right don't matter what matters is the hand that can turn you and give you a peek to the very thing that can help you then all of a sudden the cancer don't matter the brain bleed don't matter the spirits of hell don't matter anxiety don't matter fear don't matter depression don't matter none of this stuff don't matter all you do is you got your eyes upon something and your hands in the air so if i can just touch that line if i could just grab a hold of it if i could just grab him tonight that's all that matters i set my course and i began walking with my hands up saying lord jesus there's only one thing left i've got to grab that line if i don't my family would perish yet i'm trying to go as hard as i can in the right direction lord that's right let me touch the lifeline too as i'm going and after a while as i was walking something hit my hands it was that wire he said and once i hit that wire oh you're talking about rejoicing you talking about shouting you talking about praising the lord oh hallelujah i wonder what it would be tonight what kind of service and what kind of victory you could have if just for five minutes 10 minutes 30 minutes an hour that you would quit looking at all the things around you that don't matter and the spirits that are around us that don't matter and the sickness that is around us that don't matter and the problems that are bothering you that don't matter and the feelings and the and the things that tries to come in your mind and saturate you it don't matter oh i wish somebody grabbed a hold of that tonight this world don't matter and if you'll realize that don't matter your hands will go up cause up there is what matters why am i why you got your hands up because there's a lifeline why does children of god when they worship their lord throw their hands up because there's a lifeline and all of a sudden you'll go along service after service with your hands up praising god but after a while you hit the line and once you hit the line you say here it is boys let's go we're going home we're leaving cancer we're leaving trouble we're leaving sickness we're leaving problems we're leaving devils [Applause] because they don't matter i want the devil to get an ear full of it tonight he don't matter can somebody say that tonight he don't matter hallelujah that felt good didn't it just put his name devil you don't matter now make it personal what you've been dealing with high blood pressure you don't matter anxiety you don't matter start putting some words in your mouth and begin to tell the devil he don't man he been telling you long enough you don't matter he told you for years brother joe you didn't matter and he tried to trash your life and he tried to tear it all down but god said he matters god said you matter god says you matter god said you matter so what the devil says don't matter [Applause] [Music] he says if you've never been born again keep them hands up till you touch that lifeline and then hold on to it till you get to glory for he's real he would tell us in john 14 1 let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believing also in me in my father's house or many mansions if it were not so i would have told you but i go to prepare a place for you and if i go to prepare a place for you i will come again oh my god i will come again now why would he tell us not for our heart to not be troubled if it wasn't going to be a time of trouble he knew what was coming he knew all of these things but he said i've went to prepare a place and if i've done that i will come again and that's all that matters hallelujah praise the lord listen he says he's a god that can meet any condition did you hear me if we would talk about our testimony tonight we'd all come from various conditions places of of torture and torment spirits that tried to hold us all of us had different things we battled but he met every condition i know people come to this church sometimes or at other churches sometimes and they come out of the world and hey man brother elle talk to me about this he said you come in this place and you think well man all these are holy people we weren't always holy we weren't always living righteous but spirits had us demons at us devil's had us so young person don't thank you the only one that's ever been attacked by the devil or held by the devil we've all been held by devils but that didn't matter because this god meets every condition and he's a very present help in the time of trouble so devils don't matter conditions don't matter sickness don't matter spirits don't matter anything the devil can kind of bring try to bring does not matter what matters he's able to meet them and he's able to conquer them and he's able to bring them under his feet he's able to make them bow to the name of jesus christ that's what matters i know coronavirus is trying to tell you it matters what matters is god heals coronavirus cancer tries to say i matter what matters is god heals it he defeated it at calvary that's what really matters but he meets any conditions the disciples found that out one day they was out on a boat having a testimony meeting had went off and he had went up to the mountains to pray he was and so the devil saw that for an opportunity and said he's not with them now and he's here well it's my time to get them he says the devil says i'm going to sink them i'm going to go because they went off without him and that's just what he's trying to do now he's trying to blow his poison breath and bring the old seas into a nervous prostration what we are seeing in the realms that we're living in is the devil blowing his old poison breath and the seas are beginning to be tormented and and and the people are beginning to and to scream and cry out and try to come against the church of god saying i'll sink them now standing his old evil eyes on every wave lashing out with lightning thunders roaring i'm going to get him we're going to get him cause they're without him he's gone off seems like and he said that's what the devil has done to the church today he said he thinks he's going off without jesus he said don't go over to the world around and get around to people but get let's say they said we we've got to get something they haven't got he said we've got something they haven't got we've got jesus he said they got glamour they got this and they got that but we got jesus hello world you got sickness you got pain you got problems you got situations and conditions we've got jesus he said what happened the conditions got so bad all hopes were gone oars broke sails broke and it was a ship out there with no nothing to guide it just a little bobber and bobber on top of a wave crashing about you know what he done he knew they were going to get in trouble he saw the waves coming before they got there he saw 220 before you got there he saw the waves that were coming he saw the spirits that would be against the church he knew what was going to take place he knew who would get sick he knew how the enemy would come against the ministry and seemingly pour out his vengeance and this minister go down with sickness his minister's wife be attacked time after time and people all over the place now coming down with things seemingly everywhere he knows about it you know what he done he climbed to the highest hill that was in palestine further up you go the further you can see and he climbed up to the top so he could watch them and when they got in trouble and needed him he could be a very prison help in the time of trouble brother when they crucified him at calvary the world thought they had him death thought he had him hell thought he had him devil thought he had him but he broke every seal and he not only climbed through calvary but he went beyond every moon and star and he sets to the right hand of the imaginative majesty tonight and his eye is on the sparrow and if he knows about a little bitty bird i know he watches over me he sees her troubles he sees our frustrations he sees everything whirling around like it is some of them are trying to say well i just don't believe it others are saying this this way sickness and cancer and diseases of all kinds setting in amongst christians getting off acting world and everything just let the whip come in that's all but remember don't forget he's sitting up on high watching you he's watching you he knows what's going on he knows what's been going on in your car he knows what's been going on in your bedroom he knows when that spooky spirit been coming at you in your bedroom some of your sisters by yourself and trying to attack you he knows all about it trying to bring our daughters and nightmares spirits trying to attack he knew what was happening and right at the darkest hour when all hope was gone here he come walking on the sea those disciples he said was just like a lot of people today that was the only help they could ever get only help the only thing that could help them they were afraid of it thought it was a spook thought it was something bad thought it was something the devil had done they were afraid of it he said that's what it is today people don't know what to do about it and he's walking right among us again he's walking among us in the trouble atomic bombs nuclear bombs everything hanging everywhere but right in this dark hour when all the churches are confused denominations are tore up jesus is walking right among us don't forget who's here he hasn't left us hallelujah he's walking right among us and the other and he said now the others will where jesus said there's two spirits and the last days were deceived the very elected was possible some are deceived but some see him who he is and what he's doing among us and when we see no matter how many things god did how he blessed us they went right on anyhow you can't stop it that's just the way the world is you go to the doctor he said well i'm sorry to tell you you got cancer cancer and william quickly it's all gone you're dead doctor said it paralyzed paralytic leukemia it's all gone dead right there fear sets in but who made the promise what are we living for what are we what is the church of the living god living for why are we filled with the holy ghost to remember in the time of trouble he's still here hallelujah in the time of trouble he's still here and he stabilizes things he brings a word that says he's the same yesterday today and forever he's with us just the same it doesn't matter what hell he's bringing god's still with us don't matter if nations are scared of death bombs are sitting in the hangar god's still with us it don't matter if any moment this world's gonna be blown to pieces god's still with us it doesn't matter if all things are seemingly falling apart god's still with us hallelujah don't fear what man is doing fear god don't fear him who can destroy the body but fear though but he can destroy both body and soul and hell that's right he said but what is it he is still with us everything to remedy every cause that the devil can starve is right here right now okay maybe i got to read that again it went he said everything the devil can cause the remedy is here right now praise the lord you got trouble he's got a remedy trouble we have it he is right here don't forget he's in the ship i thought it was amazing brother brown would refer to psalms 27 1 as we bring this down the lord in the rapture service the service for the rapture he would read this quote or the scripture the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear let these words sink deep i think are we in the rapture time well then i believe these words ought to mean more to us than ever the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat but my flesh they stumbled and fell and though a host shouldn't camp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise up against me and this will i be confident one thing have i desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life and to behold the beauty of the lord to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock oh praise the god of abraham isaac and jacob this god has not left you he knew this would be a time of trouble but he's going to hide you he knew the spirits would be against you but he's going to be for you psalms 37 39 says but the salvation of the righteous is of the lord and he is their strength in the time of trouble and the lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him psalms 46 says god is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble daniel 12 1 says at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never seen since there was a nation even to that same time and that don't matter what matters is at that time thy people shall be delivered i think we can just go ahead and rejoice we're going to turn our eyes from a trouble because in our trouble at that time you're going to be delivered every name that's been found written in the book romans 8 31 says what shall we then say to these things if god before us who who who cancer who corona who they don't matter because god's for us fear who doubts who spirits of unrighteousness who don't matter what shall we say to these things if god be for us who can be against us who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect who satan who he don't matter who is he that condemneth satan don't matter that's fine it is christ that died yea rather that has risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness peril or sword as is written for thy sake we're killed all the day long we're counted as sheep for the slaughter nay and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor anything and the anointing the creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord the devil who what's what does he say when we're going to look onto him and that day he said they shall look upon on him and say is this the one that troubled us you're going to look at him you're gonna look at that demon cancer that's the one the devil wants to make you think he's some big bad dude he got his backbone broke as far as i can under as far as i understand once you get your backbone broke which is what happened to calvary it broke his backbone therefore he is incapacitated he has no power he is nothing but a bluff who you know the next thing you need to have that demon of fear comes to you and said put tries to put you need to look at him and say who yeah what you what did you say you want to do no you ain't doing it because our god is greater our god is stronger our god is mightier my god he's a god that wins all battles he's a god who meets any condition he's the god who's the conqueror of conquerors the king of kings and the lord of lords the mighty god and he's my god that's all that matters let's bar his mercy start playing that song our god is greater i heard god is greater he
