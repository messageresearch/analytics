place Lord Lord knowing Lord that you've promised that you would be here in our midst Lord and that once again Lord you have proven it to be true Lord I I know you're already here and you're already moving but right now Lord I just want to ask you to take complete preeminence take complete control father Lord you see all the notes and things laid out in front of me Lord and and and and my thoughts and and how I was torn on which way to go but Lord right now I'm just asking you to take over and you take control and and you lead Lord Lord that way we can say it'll be good to be in the house of God lord cuz if you come and take over things of Eternal value take place father Lord if it's just me then what good is it but Lord I'm yielding myself to you right now father and asking you to just take complete control speak father to every heart that's gathered here today I pray in Jesus name amen amen amen a isn't it good to be a Christian this morning amen if you have your Bibles we're going to go straight into the word we're going to turn to Revelation 10 and we're going to read Revelation 10 7-1 amen amen I just pray that Lord will help us today uh you know I was still not real sure which way this is going to go if it's going to be you know teaching or preaching just just however however the Lord takes it you know I said something about teaching this morning and my daughter is like oh man you're not going to bring the power today well and I told her I was going to tell y'all she said that and she asked me not to but here we are but you know what I can't bring the power anyway we need him to come and bring the power this morning amen so I'm just asking that he'll take control amen Revelation 10 verse 7 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared cled to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall make thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eat e it up my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues and Kings amen I pray that the Lord will add his Blessing to the word as as you have your seats this morning amen you know this is a scripture that I that I know that we're all very very familiar with and I and I chose to read from here today because you know we can use this scripture as a marker a as a marker for where we are in time and for what has taken place in this day amen we know that the seventh angel has come and has sounded his message so with that we can confidently say that that if the final Angel has sounded then we are at the end time amen be because we we've reached the end and we can declare that the mystery of God is finished you know because it's quite simple really if there are still Mysteries and there are still things sealed and truths not in their proper place and then brother brandham wasn't the seventh angel if you can still look and say well this hasn't been opened and this is still left sealed then then then brother Bram isn't the seventh angel because when the seventh angel sounds his message the mystery of God should be finished so with the sounding of that message come comes the fullness of the word comes the completion of of the Mi of all the Mysteries and we can we can declare today that the book is an open book because we see it right here in verse 8 it says go and take the little book which is open we see it right there in the scripture the the angel has sounded his message and then in verse eight we see the book is is is an open book and then and then we're told to go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel we're told to consume the book and then we see a commission to us there's a commission and the commission says that that we are to prophesy again in other words there's something that we have to do in this day church is not about you know well I've got it all memorized and I've got all the head knowledge and I can out debate this one and I can I can do this but no there there's a prophesying that is supposed to come out of our Lives there's a prophesying that's supposed to come out of this Bride As she is the the final voice to the final age amen so there's something that we're to do we're commissioned to speak as the final voice but but first I want you to see there is to be a consuming of the book before there is a speaking and I said this before the problem is a lot of times we have people speaking that hadn't eaten the book you know and it's the eating of the book is the revelation of the word is taking the book and consuming it that's supposed to give you something to say because if that's not what you're saying then you're speaking your own ideas or you're speaking your Church's ideas or you're speaking this man's ideas amen but but today it's what has been revealed under the seventh angel messenger that we are supposed to be proclaiming we're not here to Proclaim evening light Tabernacle we're not here to Proclaim this church or this pastor we are here to Proclaim that the seventh angel has come that the message has sounded and that that message was truth amen amen and not our own ideas and not the ideas of this church not some pet doctrine that has been revealed to you but take the open Word and put that open Word In Action today Amen Let the open word manifest through your life and let the power of God manifest through you amen the power of that word manifest in your life because it is the opening of the B book it is the revealing of the word the the tying up of all the Loose Ends that has given us the authority to stand and Proclaim power over the enemy there were ages where they couldn't stand and Proclaim that because there there were claims against the church there was false doctrines and so the enemy held the power but today those claims have been struck off today those claims have been done away with light has shined and as that light shine you saw who you were you saw your position in Christ you saw your name in the book and so now you recognize I have authority over that thing I have power over that what gave us that it was the opening of the word amen it was the tying up of all the Loose Ends the truths of Luther the truths of Wesley the truths of Pentecost they each had truths but none of them were able to put it all together none of them were able to put it all together but they had their individual truth and so because of this the enemy still had claims on the church John Smith would come along and and and and restore immersion in baptism and yet he still did it in titles so he had a truth he had the truth of immersion and yet he's he's doing it in titles what is that that's a loose end that's something not restored properly and and there were many other things that were left loose but we were promised a message in the last day that would come and tie all those loose ends together and let me declare to you we have received it it has come that message was perfect and all the Loose Ends have been tied together and the Mystery of God has been finished brother Bram tells us here he says and at the end of the Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive according to the word as God helped me tonight to show you through here we are to receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole Secret Of God what for the rapturing of the church it's the revealing of the word the tying up of the Loose Ends that gives you what the rapturing faith that you need the power that you need to take a Rapture amen and and and this wasn't just progress the message of the hour wasn't just progress the message of the hour was completion it was a completion of of of the Mysteries that Luther brought progress and it was great progress and Wesley brought progress and isua brought progress many great men down Through the Ages would would catch little glimpses and they would catch a little bit and it would it would bring progress but this messenger sounded a message that brought completion to to it all the mystery of God the whole thing what are we waiting on brother Aaron uh who's going to come to finish it no no no nobody's going to come to finish it it has been finished in this day now there's just got to be a people that have a hunger for it and a desire for it and they take the book for themselves not just the preachers not just the deacons but a people that say I'm part of that word that word is part of me I'm going to consume it for myself amen now as I say that that doesn't mean that we don't still progress we always have to be progressing the people came out of of Egypt they stayed under the same message but they had to progress every day if they took their tent Stakes on a certain Doctrine and stayed in one place too long they got left behind amen so there's got to be progress you know there was those that came out under Luther's message that progress further than others and those were the ones who were able to step into the next message and go on with the word and and there was those under Wesley that that progressed further than others under his message and they were able to accept the outpouring of the gifts and then there was those in the isua movement that that progress further and we able to accept the opening of the word well where are we going to progress who no we're going to progress under that message cu the next step those who progress with the message are going to take a final step and they're going to step into eternity they're going to step into a Rapture not into a new message not into a new revelation but the next step if you progress with the message is to take a Rapture in this day amen we're to be progressing all the time and in that progress what is that progress brother it's it's allowing the revelation of of this finishing message to change us from glory to glory we're to be changing to be growing and and making progress all the time underneath the revelation of this message because listen let's just be honest if if if we had attained it all if if we all had it figured out just right and and we completed everything we were supposed to do and everyone was in their perfect place and the bride body was complete we wouldn't still be here we'd be gone so just looking around at that we got to recognize there's progress for us to do there's steps I need to take I need to go further look I don't want to be the one holding this thing up Lord I want to be in my place so when you're ready you don't have to say well I'm waiting on this no I want to progress to the place you want me at this morning hey man there's still work to be accomplished I'll say this there's still prodical to return why are we still here cuz we're not leaving a hoof behind why we still here because we're waiting on prodal there there's still Devils to be cast out amen there are family Cycles to be broken there are families to be restored there are stronghold to take amen we're not leaving here and the devil go yeah they left but I still held this ground no sir we're taking all the ground we're taking The High Ground we're taking the valleys we're taking all of it and we're not leaving till it's all completed oh that's easy to talk about hey but there's strongholds in our lives that we're going to conquer before we leave we're always pointing we're going to conquer this we're going to conquer that we got to conquer this we got to defeat this right here amen but I'd like to announce to you today we have the power to do it we're not waiting on it to come because the revelation of the full word came with the full power of that word it wasn't just a head knowledge it's not just a mystery it's not just a Doctrine but with the opening of the word came the unveiling of power to you amen and that's what we're speaking on today is the unveiling of power always progressing I was talking to my wife I said you know sometimes as ministers you feel like you get into a theme and every time you study something you end up on that theme and I feel like progress has kind of been a theme of mine for a while now not being satisfied going forward not staying where you're at the Bible is replete with scriptures that encourage us to progress and to grow and to move beyond our current condition wherever you are today don't stay there wherever you're at maybe it's in a trial maybe it's in depression maybe it's bound down with anxiety maybe it's Justified maybe it's Sanctified maybe you've had an anointing of the Holy Ghost poured out on your life don't stay there wherever you are today take another step well I receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost I've been sealed praise God don't stay there today press in and say Lord I need a refilling I need more of you today don't stay there Philippians 3 and12 scriptures a call to action urging you to strive to go higher higher Heights and deeper depths Paul says not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that which I also am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth under those things which are before I press toward the mark of the prize for the prize of the high calling in God of God in Christ Jesus well who wrote that I bet that was somebody really struggling brother Aaron now that was the messenger of the age he says I haven't attained it all I'm full of imperfections but I'm following after you know what that means that means pursuing with Vigor I must have more I must know him more I'm not satisfied with where I'm at amen I hope that's the Cry of everybody in this room today Lord thank you for what you done I appreciate for what You' done for me but I am not satisfied with where I'm at I've got to go deeper today I'm following after I'm pursuing it with Vigor I want to leave here changed today by the power of God he says I haven't apprehended it yet but one thing I do forgetting the things which are behind reaching for what is before I press towards the mark evening light Tabernacle press towards the Mark today not Coast in not I've received the message so now I get to sit back and wait for the Rapture you're going to sit back and find yourself in the tribulation but you got to press towards the mark you got to press into eternal life you got to fight for it today to attain more forget what's behind forget what you know forget what you think you have accomplished forget where you have failed you can look at this several ways forgetting what's behind a lot of us need to forget our failures but a lot of us get hung up on our last success I'm not saying to forget the grace of God but but but what I'm saying is I'll give another example that I've given before with the children of Israel three weeks later if you were still dancing on the banks of the Red Sea because of that Victory you was left behind it's time to press to another Victory it's time to take more land it's time to move on from your last Revival and step say Lord I need a refilling today I need more of you today don't get hung up back there there's a race to run today you know a lot of Christians are like that that guy that's still living in high school tell you how fast they used to be and what they used to do that's bro you're you're you're an old man stop well a lot of Christians are there I remember when God did this back at 27 years ago that's great what he do for you today where you at today where do you stand with him today take more today accomplish something today some people can't move on because they can't get over their failures and then others can't get on because 28 years ago they dance in the spirit you we need more who you talking to brother Aaron all of us we need more you got to let go of your past today some of us do the devil's Dirty Work We dig up more junk on ourselves than the devil does we're like I can't do it cuz I did this and the devil was like man I didn't even know he did that you are filthy sinner we go around doing this work for him digging it up I'm not worthy because I did this I'm not worth get in line some people like going around with an I'm not worthy contest none of us are worthy get over yourself can I remind you today of why Jesus died he died because we needed a savior he died because we were Sinners he died because we weren't worthy but he said my blood is sufficient oh I'm not good enough brother Aon I fail I fail I fail quit crying we all fail but today by the blood of Jesus Christ I'm made clean I'm washed a new today in Jesus name Hallelujah accept his forgiveness and let's run we got a race to run today let's take another step well brother Aaron I need a I need a fresh outpouring yep we all do but what are you doing to prepare for that outpouring how are you facilitating it what are your expectations did you walk in here today sad because you needed an outpouring or did you walk in here today excited because you knew you were going to get it today there's the difference I'm just going through something I need God to move and people live in that place for months and months and months why you got to move he's here he's willing he's ready he's looking for somebody expecting well I've just been in a rut he's here to pull you out of it he's saying I'm right here and all you got to do say Lord I'm willing I'm ready to do whatever it takes move in my life today Lord Jesus pursue with Vigor are you pressing towards the mark with all that is within you saying God I must have more of you today Paul would go on to say I Die daily listen this wasn't some halfway borderline guy sitting on the edge and man I got sin in my life and habits attached to my life I really need to get rid of so man I'm struggling every day now this was the messenger this is the writer of the New Testament and he's saying I'm not settling for how far I've come I'm going to get rid of more of me so that I might know more of him brother Brown says Paul said I Die daily and if Paul had to Die daily how much more am I going I'm going to have to stay Dead all the time if Paul had to Die daily to stay right with God so we'll all have to do that just die out to ourselves he says now I don't mean to say you went out in the world and you did this and that but you done something oh brother surely not yeah you done something that's true he says you've got to repent and Die daily to live in Jesus Christ so every daily every day you've got to die every day to live in Christ Jesus everything about the Christian Life involves going further and experiencing more Enoch what'd he do walked with God he didn't stand still he was moving moving he was progressing and as individuals I just want to say we can't settle today we can't settle because you've come out we can't settle because you're a message believer or because you shouted or you danced but make the determination I'm going all the way what do you mean all the way brother Aaron that means you don't stop at justification you don't stop at sanctification get born again and sealed by the spirit of God and then many people stop right there well I had an experience awesome now go all the way what do you mean get get full of the spirit and then go all the way fight today to know him more fight today to experience him more fight today for greater Revelation fight today to be the version of yourself that God intended you to be going all the way don't just mean getting full of the Holy Spirit uh we got to that's the token but going all the way means until the day I'm raptured I'm going to fight to attain more that's going all the way until the day I'm raptured I'm going to press towards the mark of the high calling and I believe that's also how we as a broad body the collective body from the world around the world have to be also not just satisfied with correct Doctrine not just satisfied in the knowledge of the Mysteries not not satisfied with just the mechanics or even just the Dynamics you get out of balance either way amen because when we settle we make void the entire point of the restoration and we go back to operating in portions again the point of the restoration was you don't got to operate in just a portion anymore that's the error people make they say well we don't have to do these things anymore because now that which is perfect has come that which in part is done away with because we have the hole did did we not go to elementary school did we not do a pie chart y'all remember pie chart and if every piece of pizza is there sorry I'm a fatty I think about food it's pizza if every piece of pizza's there we got the hole but think of how smart it is to go but now that we've got the hole we don't need these three pieces throw them away you don't have the hole no more the pieces make the hole the parts make the hole what it's saying is you don't have to operate on that piece alone anymore this isn't the only piece you have so we're not doing that's done away with just this part or just this part now we've got all the parts you can't throw Parts away and still claim to have the whole you don't have the whole and I'll just address this to to evening light Tabernacle this morning we can't settle for formal and traditional Services where you know maybe even the word is explained perfectly and Mysteries are unfolded to a tea and we're just Wild by it and yet the spirit's lacking listen this is not a dead word this message is not not a dead message this word is full of life this word is full of Victory this word is full of healing this word is full of Deliverance it's not a dead message it's a Living Word and we are supposed to be a living people today full of the power of God not making excuses for why it's missing why we don't need it you need it it's here it's available we just got to move past our ideas and say Lord pour it out in my life I want to tap in to the power of God this morning Hallelujah I'll tell you I'm faithful that faith is preached here there's lots of things Jesus could have said but he said when I return will I find I'm thankful that faith is preached here and expectations are raised to expect the impossible to expect the supernatural to expect the miraculous every service listen I'm expecting an outpouring today I'm expecting to move in this service today I'm expecting the miraculous today because it's been taught that we are to expect it and it's been fostered and it's been ministered Time After Time After Time and he has showed up Time After Time After Time and I Just Want to Thank You Lord For showing up where we invite you but I'm saying Lord I need you today I need a fresh outpouring today I'm expecting you to move at evening light Tabernacle in this service at my Pew today hallelujah thank you Jesus because where faith is not preached you find a faithless congregation when the moving of the spirit isn't preached you find places where the spirit doesn't move well we believe in those things brother Aaron that's good but why aren't they manifesting because they're not preached we have to keep those things those truths in front of us at all times so that our level of expectation is at the level of the promise because we can say we believe in something and not be expecting it right you can say you believe in something and not be expecting it things like freedom of the spirit freedom of worship that's something that fostered over a period of time by the leadership and the congregation of the church amen it's something that's fostered over time you know breakout Services where the power of God really moves and there's a there's a great response those things happen because the people feel free to respond because the atmospheres have been fostered and even promoted if every time the spirit moves and people rejoice and shout and the minister gets up and starts warning about it well y'all be careful about that now y'all y'all be careful about that because you know you know you could be deceived and and it's not really and it's not then the people get all confused well are we are we supposed to worship are we supposed to be fre can we be am I wrong for doing that sh should I even can I even are we supposed to and then that same person come there and go I believe in it but the people don't know the people aren't sure I'm thankful to be at a place and there's other places all all over this ain't just a evening like Tabernacle thing there's places all over where God is free to move how he wants to move where the spirit has complete freedom to work and operate the way that he wants to work and operate I say we want everything that God has for us I want solid teaching I want Evangelistic preaching we want a true Godly balance we we we don't want to settle into comfortable we don't want to settle into status quo and and this is how we do church and every Service is like this tradition and Norms tradition and Norms I want to show up going I don't know what's going to happen today and I don't care as long as God's in it as long as God's moving I just want him to have his way I sure don't want my attitude and my expectation to hinder what God is going to do Lord just move how you want to move whatever it takes to save a soul whatever it takes for a Deliverance today whatever it takes to light a fire in my heart today Lord just do it I'm open to it I'm inviting you Lord I know the word is open I'm thankful the word's open but with the word came great power and I want to see it manifested in this place today Hallelujah but as a body evening like Tabernacle let us walk on advancing in the word advancing in Revelation advancing in power that's my expectation as we stand here on his promises that we're going to see more than we've ever seen before we're going to see more manifested in 2025 than we've ever seen before we're going to see healings like we've never seen before we're going to see Deliverance like we've never seen before we're going to see prodal come back like we've never seen before that is my expectation because he is a god of increase amen is a god of increase so as we go further I'm expecting more I'm expecting greater not less and less more and more he doesn't back up and get less we didn't get down here to lead DEA with wickedness on the increase the devil on the increase millions of demons released from the river Euphrates and God says now that I have sent a message to restore the word I'm going to expect you to grow in great head knowledge and I'm going to pull back on the Deliverance for a while I'm going to pull back on the supernatural I'm going I'm going to pull back on the healings and you're going to have less power as you face greater enemies no it doesn't even make good sense if you stop and think about it for a minute but with the opening of the word came more power and more Authority power over the flesh power over sin power over the devil power over the lukewarm Spirit power to do the Greater Works of John 14:12 power for a body change power for a Rapture more than ever before Hallelujah God is a god of increase and he's given us everything we need today to put our foot on the heads of the serpent what Serpent's attacking your home what Serpent's attacking your body what serpent is attacking your mind you are the last serpent bruisers in the final age and you have the power today to take your foot and put it on the devil and say that's enough no more your attack stopped today your Victory stops today because I've been empowered as the Bride of Jesus Christ under the opening of The Seven Seals I've been given authority over you Hallelujah and he's going to continue to pour out his Spirit he's going to continue to pour out his power until we take the total Victory and leave here in a Rapture acts 2:17 says then it shall come to pass in the last days it didn't say next to the last days it didn't say 40 years before the last days the last days where are we the last days saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams well brother Aaron if we got people seeing visions and people having spiritual dreams and they're being inter that takes away from the prophet that's just dumb if you don't have it it takes away from the Bible and on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days my spirit and they shall prophesy so a little class participation I asked you where are we at last days how much is he going to give this he's going to sprinkle a little bit here and and this one's going to get some of it and and this one the super super gifted people and there's going to be one here and I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh poor I like the word that he uses here to describe it how do you describe it when you look out the window and it's just kind of barely raining it's misting come to pass in the last days that I will Mist out my spirit or it's rain a little bit harder than that it's turned into a sprinkle that's trinitarian anyway he's sprinkling no no no no when you look out there and you know we have other Expressions it's raining like cats and dogs it's it's coming down in sheets but you know how it is to where you can't get from here to there without getting completely drenched you can't get in your vehicle without getting completely drenched I mean covered from head to toe I mean completely spping wet you say it's pouring out there I'm telling you in the last days it is pouring out it's time that you put away your umbrellas lay down your pride quit being afraid of it and step out into the porn and say cover me up Lord however I hack whatever I got to do I'm done pretending but pour it out on me Lord Jesus I get tired of people sitting underneath their umbrella was laughing at the people dancing in the rain I say forget about it just dance in the rain pour it out on me Lord Jesus I got to have it today Glory pour it out Lord Jesus well we don't need that God thought we did and he promised you're going to have it are you expecting it he's a god of increase more Revelation more power from the beginning and I may slow down here for a little bit from the beginning that's how God has done things he's revealed himself in a progressive manner revealing more unveiling more and as he reveals more of himself than what that with that Revelation comes more power he would reveal himself and what he was doing by his name there in the Old Testament and just so we understand what I'm talking about I got a few examples says these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were creating in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens notice all caps on the word Lord capital L capital O capital r and capital D in the King James it always is this way when it's referring to Jehovah so when you see it all capitalized that's Jehovah which means the self-existing one but there's notations in the scoffield that Haba from which Jehovah or Yahweh is formed signifies also to become that is to become known thus pointing to a continuous and increasing self-revelation so the name Jehovah then would mean the self-existent one who reveals himself he's constantly revealing himself it's a constant unfolding never a backing up never a backing up there's no going backwards and taking away what he gives okay once he gives it you have it now that doesn't mean that you're not supposed to go forward but you never go back behind that it's like people who are so afraid of what God gave at isua listen isua accepting the gifts and the moving of the spirit and those things was never their error their error was rejecting the word their error was not taking what God gave them and going into the word you say well we're going to do away with that okay well let's do away with sanctification and everybody for that let's do away with justification we don't need that anymore we got the opening of the word does that even make good sense no God's always going forward take what he's given you and progress don't settle down on it like the Pentecost did with you got to have the tongues to have the Holy Ghost and and then they began to manufacture things they got all complete out of order we know how that how that all went because they wouldn't progress we got to take what he's given us and progress there's no backing up or going backwards just another example of this one in Genesis 12 now the Lord capital L capital O capital r capital D had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land I will show thee what you're seeing here once again is the name Jehovah but if you look just a little further on in Genesis 17 And1 you see a further unveiling and when Abram was 90 years old and nine the lord it's Jehovah appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect so now here almighty God translates to elai so what is it it was another unfolding of who he was another aspect of his nature it was it was expressing what he's doing at the time and there are many other other examples that we could show in other scriptures but just to go quickly when he provided a ram for Abraham he was expressing himself as Jehovah Gyra it was another unfolding it was another unveiling and his nature and his character is progressively being unfolded all through the scriptures and I'm going to skip from there all the way to the beginning of the New Testament and then the word arrives on the scene as Jesus all the names and we didn't list but a couple of them but all the compound names all the prophecies all the unveilings pointing to this and now all of it is manifested in Jesus he was the wisdom of Solomon he was the Psalms of David he encompassed all of the Old Testament he is the highest revelation of God he is mzc he is El Shai he is Jehovah Gyra he is Jehovah Rafa amen there is not a greater revelation of God than in Jesus and from him comes all other Revelations he is the fullness of the word and here he was in flesh standing upon the Earth and by the logic of many today since the fullness had come then he wouldn't manifest any of the powers that were spoke about before because he was the the fullness so since the fullness was there then we were we were Beyond healing we were Beyond Supernatural things those things were childish the fullness was here so all he was going to do was teach and make sure that you understood the Mysteries and what we saw was the word made flesh manifested itself not just in knowledge but with power and withth Authority yes he taught yes he taught like no man had ever taught before and then what he taught was demonstrated amen I can't understand the attitude that because we have the fullness of the word then that the manifestation of that word is now going to cease and decrease that those things are only going to we're only there to catch the attention of people to draw them to the word yes that's true but it's progress you don't leave those things behind they come along with you what I know is that when the fullness of the word was made flesh 2,000 years ago in the man Christ Jesus the word made flesh was full of power that's what I know what did the fullness of the word do how did the fullness of the word act how did the greatest of all Revelations manifest itself and Jesus went about all Galilee teaching yes he did in the synagogue and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people and his Fain went throughout all Syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with diverse diseases and torments and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatic and those that had the py and he sent them away and said don't you know it's about the Mysteries and he healed them it's the very nature of Jesus the greatest Revelation the greatest embodiment of the word the complete fullness and so Jesus said unto them we have the word now so y'all just going to have to be sick y'all just going to have to stay bound up we're Beyond those things no sir the fullness of the word brought the full of his power there was healing power there was delivering power there was power to provide there was power to create he was everything you had seen in the Old Testament rolled into one he created a universe he came and he created eyeballs he was still a Healer he was still a Creator he was still a provider he was all those things and he was full of quickening power prophet of God says our lord Jesus is so full of quickening power he he was all of it together he was so full of quickening power he said this you destroy this body and I'll raise it up in three days you talk about confidence and quickening power destroy this body and this Temple and I will bring it up in three days now look I'm going to get a little bit of my ahead of myself right here and that's okay the word is once again in flesh the word is once again embodied behind human beings and it's full of quickening power she is bone of his bone she's flesh of his flesh she's power of his power she is him she is what he is I say what devil can stand before him what mountain can stand before him then what are you worried about today what devil can stand before you what mountain can stand before you no wonder you're the mountain movers no wonder you're the serpent bruisers today what mountain I say it's going to crumble before you because your bone of his bone little bride you are full of quickening power you're full of it today it's time to turn it loose it's time to put it in action I said it before David could have done this for hours and he' have never killed Goliath I got power in this sling there's power in this word I got faith look at the Mysteries no sir you got to turn it loose one of these days let the quickening power go to its Mark and bring your giant down today it's more than just word it's more just talking about about it put it in action Hallelujah quickening power that's what brought him out of the Tomb that's what's going to take you off the Earth one of these days because you have the same quickening power he was the fullness he was all of it he was full of quickening power and when the church Spilled Out Of The Upper Room on the day of Pentecost it was like he had never left it was like he had never left Peter and John leave the upper room in the very next chapter they come down past the gate called Beautiful on their way to the temple and there lays a beggar the Bible said had been lame from birth begging for arms Bible says who seen Peter and John about to go into the temple asking arm and Peter fastened his eyes upon him with John and said look on us you talk about confidence they knew look they hadn't been indoctrinated with that was for the days gone by they hadn't been indoctrinated with that was only for the prophet they hadn't been filled up with ecclesiastical doubt they just left the upper room they knew what happened right he walked up and said look on us and he gave him heed unto them expecting to receive something he was going to now I know we take this and we say well yeah he was expecting arms I just want to focus on something else he was expecting he was expecting they had got their attention and he was expecting expecting something and he was going to receive greater than he ever expected God don't disappoint you God don't disappointed Lord I'm here to receive today you'll receive and you'll receive even more than you could ever imagine he's not going to disappoint he was expecting to receive something then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have what do he have quickening power such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones receive strength and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple quietly as to not disturb the people who think that's out of order I've said it many many many many many many many times we're not all going to worship the same some are going to be quieter that's fine some are going to be loud that's okay we love it but when God does something for you and nobody knows about it thank you Jesus you makes me wonder I mean he wasn't ashamed to come down and be identified with you he wasn't ashamed to come down and do a miracle for you an undeserving person he came down and and did something for you in that moment when God does something for you when God speaks to your heart when God gives a revelation don't be afraid to say thank you Jesus thank you Lord I love you Jesus I'm here to praise your name he entered into the temple walking and leaping and praising God they knew something had happened well that might get people's attention yep praise God now I got an audience to testify to let me tell you what God did for me God saved me when I was a wretched sinner I was no good I was lost I was going to hell I didn't stand a chance and I didn't deserve it but he reached out his hand for me and so I'm walking and leaping and praising God because he is a wonderful God and he deserves my praise sir brother BR says when Peter and John passed through the gate called Beautiful lifted up the man that had been crippled from his mother's wound it was a sign God was in the camp when the Holy Ghost returned on Pentecost and endued that bunch of people with power power it was a sign God was in the camp well I think it's all a bunch of hogwash when that goes on I think it's a sign God's in the camp thank you Lord Peter had it after Pentecost and he went to the gate called beautiful and there laid a man crippled from his mother's womb said Silver and Gold Have I None but I got some hidden power I'll give you if you'll believe it and he picked him up by the hand and raise him in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and you knew what he projected hidden power listen I know sometimes it looks hidden sometimes we're beat down sometimes we come together and it's like my goodness how did everybody in the whole church have a bad day on the same day but even then even then well this one's got issues and that one's carnal that's okay that's what bayac saw and he tried to get balum to curse them all but brother Brandon points out in the midst of that flawed people those people with their backside and their carnal Parts even then the pillar of fire was in their midst even then God moved amongst them with signs and wonders and the supernatural maybe you had a bad day maybe you seen my carnality that's okay even then God move in this place manifest yourself here like never before well this one does this and this one bothers me and this one and this one and this one keep that list together to read to Jesus on that [Music] day I believe the Bible I just don't believe and going to church with all them people if you don't you can't not go to church and claim to believe the Bible end of argument because the Bible says to what were they doing after Pentecost it was like he had never left they did the same works because they were operating in the same power this is the book of Acts you know it well says and there was at japa a certain disciple named Tabitha which by interpretation is called Dorcas this woman was full of good works and all arms Deeds which she did and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died man I wish Jesus was still here Joe I I wish Jesus we still here he is he just veiled in a multi membered body now the same power same power whom when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamber and for as much as L was not to japa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there they sent unto him two men Desiring him that he would not delay to come to them then then Peter arose and went with them and when he was come they brought him into the upper chamber I'm going to be real nice and just keep going and all the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made while she was with them but Peter put them all forth listen when you get doubt out of the building Supernatural can take place Peter put them all out forth and kneel down and prayed and turned him to the body and said Tabitha arise I wonder where he learned to operate that way arise I a even going go all the way back to Jesus although that that's the main source to go to but let's just go back to the message that we claim to believe and follow how do we get off with some of the ways we act because it sure didn't teach us to act that way taught us to have faith it taught us to believe for the miraculous it taught us to believe for the supernatural it taught us that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday that was the theme of the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we're in the Forever part amen still the same arise and she opened her eyes and when she saw Peter she sat up how'd he do it same power it was as though he never left acts 16 the same followed Paul and us and cried saying these men are the Servants of the most high God which show unto us the way of Salvation and this she did many days but Paul being grieved he got tired of it turned and said to the spirit I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and he came out that same hour same power same power in Acts 14 Paul heals a man acts 28 puas his father is healed and it causes a healing service to break out on the entire Island prison gates are open in Acts 12 prison doors and chains are loose in Acts 16 they were operating with the same power doing the same works it was the true church it was Mark 16 in action Amen brother brandom says the true church is Mark 16 and acts and says it has to be and then he drives that down a little harder and he says all else is false that's right and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover what was the book of Acts doing they were fulfilling this commission they were the true church the same power on display but now in a many membered body and as we have seen up to this point every Revelation and every unfolding brought with it more power more Victory and here we are today and brother brandham says what the church had at Pentecost is her in Alien able right originally she had the pure word now notice something people want to separate the fullness and the pureness of the word from the moving of the spirit but look here she had the pure word she had the power of the spirit you can have them both manifested in diverse signs and wonders and gifts gifts go with the pure word it all goes together it's all in one but we know that there's a true and there's a false we know that there is a church spiritual and a church carnal and Paul's warning even in Acts 20 that the Wolves would enter in carnal men speaking things contrary to the truth John War warns in John 4 that many false prophets have already gone out into the world the Antichrist Spirits already at work with the goal of of perverting the pure word and what do you find when the pure word is perverted less signs less wonders less Miracles less freedom and more formal as carnal man came and began to squeeze the life right out of the church began to prosecute the True Believer began to ridicule and attack anywhere that the spirit moved and claim that those things showed that the focus wasn't on the word now I want you to notice how brother Bram says they began to attack you know that it's not at all strange for it is the word and the name that brings the enemy pouring after us like a flood that Mighty word which was manifested in healings so how's the word supposed to manifest healing signs wonders and other demonstrations caused the Pharisees to scream out for the death of the True Believer they hated it they hated the power of God being manifested they hated it moving in the church and as time progressed and that carnal seed began to move through the false Vine truth was lost and Truth was twisted the Judah Spirit brother brand would call it had always hated the flowing of the the oil he always hated the moving of the spirit brother Brown says that Spirit couldn't go to Pentecost said Judas showed his true colors when it was time to go to Pentecost he would go along with the doctors doctrines but he showed his true colors when it came time to go to Pentecost you know and I thought about and this is just me this is no Doctrine at all but I was just thinking about it and praying about it and I I began to think about the woman who brought the the perfumed anointing oil and began to pour it out on Jesus and how Judas hated it he hated the flow of the oil brother Joe he hated it as she poured it out and he still does he begins to say couldn't we do it some other way ain't there something else we could do with our service he hated her worship that's right why does that one always have to dance isn't there something we could do a there another way that we could show that we love him it's the same one that always shouts Judas has never liked worship does it got to be like this surely our time and effort could be put somewhere else he wanted to stop the flow of that oil and that was his spirit in the church carnal trying to tone down the worship there in the first age trying to stop the moving of the spirit trying to take the life out of the church attacking any sign in any life as being fanatical and out of order he says the spirit of Christ later came back upon the true church and the spirit of Judas came back upon the false Church came in and began to make it formal came in and robbed truths began to use titles and they began to lose the revelation of the name of Jesus right there they lost most of their power many other truths were lost and replaced by false doctrines and teachings of man and holy spirit leadership was replaced by a false priesthood and and I know we don't have time to go through all the ages but we know that the spirit of nianis began to take hold and the church went into the Dark Ages and with the loss of Truth came an obvious loss of power during this period from the point Ephesus began to slide all the way till Luther comes out in the sardan age this time period is the only time since the beginning that it isn't more truth being revealed and more power being revealed and more unveiling but it actually regressed not by the hand of God and understand Church we're not against anyone we're for people this ain't a call out of anything this is just pointing in the scriptures and going this is what the prophet said I think it's very important that we're all willing to be corrected when we get out of Step Lord if I'm out of step and if I'm wrong correct me because what we learned from the vision was just because somebody seeing something different or even maybe teaching something different or not seeing it right we'll just say it like that doesn't mean they're not bride brother brandham looked and they got out of step and he hollered back get back in step and they did so this this is in no way a call out but what I'm wanting to say is this was the first time any in history from the beginning that it had regressed that power was taken away and they went the wrong direction it wasn't God doing it was the spirit of Judas doing it because it was the spirit of Judas controlling that carnal false Vine brother Brown makes it clear it was the Antichrist Spirit taking truth away it was taking power away from the people and it was making everything too mysterious for the common believer listen brother brother Tim says it great that the problem with mystery preachers is that when they get done it's still a mystery there are no more Mysteries the Mysteries are revealed we're preaching from an open book today not well you might can get this and you might not it's right there it's open it's for you it's attainable for you it's for All God's Children amen but but but they begin trying to make things too Mis mysterious and the common person can't have the Bible and it's only for the priest to read and but I want to tell you that it wouldn't be that way forever it wasn't going to stay that way forever because I will restore sayeth the Lord it had already be written in the word that all that was stolen and all that was taken away and all the truth and all the power and all that was going to be restored once again the truth that had been taken and the power that comes with that truth the power that comes with the revelation of the name of Jesus the power that comes with the unveiling it's all going to be restored it started out with a revelation the just shall live by faith what was that it's just a little unfolding here we go we done folded this thing up long enough God says it's time to unfold the just shall live by faith and the restoration begins and a return to truth begins and with that a return to the ad the Abundant power of Truth he says now notice this then God brings himself on the scene as the chief captain in the ministry of these seven men to lead his people back to the truth and the Abundant power of that Truth Listen it was the most basic truth of the whole gospel the just shall live by faith but this unveiling came with power it came with power to stand and power to stand against the Roman Catholic Church power to stand again and believe that that I don't have to buy my way to heaven that that I can believe in faith and and and know that I'm saved it came with the power and and with this many of the lies of the church are exposed by basic Revelation listen I want to hammer something right here the exposing of the devil makes him powerless because truth empowers light shows what is right but it also exposes what is wrong and the exposing of the Enemy being brings power over the enemy listen I have dozens of these but I'm only going to show you a couple how many times maybe hundreds of times where brother Randon would say this at the end of service or in a prayer line Satan you've lost the battle why you've been exposed you're nothing but a bluff I'm so thankful today he's been exposed as a bluff he's knocking at your door he's claiming all kind of things I'm going to take your life I'm going to take your children I'm going to destroy your home Satan you came to the wrong place because I see you don't have any arrows so the truth of the revelation of the word has exposed you and it has empowered me to put my foot on your neck he's nothing but a blo in your life today he has no weapon he can't stand before you just speak the word says you're nothing but a bluff and you've been exposed on the platform come out of this people in the name of Jesus Christ come out Satan you've lost the battle you've been exposed here tonight before these people to show that you cannot stand your kingdom is done it's crumbling Jesus Christ is coming and his presence is here tonight to manifest his power brother Joe can testify how many times you've prayed for people and they can't get deliverance and at some point during it all they look up and they confess something and I mean instantly it's over the devil can't stay where he's exposed but see that's why he could stay in the church all down Through the Ages is he had places to hide there was false baptisms there was Triune you know baptism there there was all kind of things there was eternal hell there there was all kind of things out of order and so he could hide there even as certain lights would hit you come up for prayer you're asking for something from God you got to expose everything you got you got to put the light brother Brandon would talk about when the light comes on roaches scatter it exposes them and they no longer have power they have to go a lie binds but truth will expose the enemy and bring you Liberty look here he says Satan you who've bound these people you're exposed tonight your grips are lost church that's where we stand at right now in this final age the lies of all the ages has been exposed and his grip on the Bride of Jesus Christ has been broken you are a free people today what's holding you what's holding you if there's anything holding you it's just a bluff if there's anything holding you just expose it he's been exposed in this day and now we're a free bride we're ready for a Rapture filled with the Holy Ghost empowered by the revelation of the word he's lost his grip on us today I'm glad that he's been exposed exposed by the word exposed to be a bluff exposed to be a liar and his exposing has shown the truth about you you never was his you never did belong to him you always did belong to God your name was always written in the book but the coming of the word showed you who he was and who you are and it gave you the power over him it gave you power over the lie I'm telling you this morning cast the lie down and accept the truth Amen brother brandom said eve had to cast down the word before she could accept the lie I'm telling you to cast down that lie of complex cast down the lie that nobody loves loves you that nobody cares cast down the lie that you can't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost cast down the lie that you're a failure cast down a lie that your children ain't coming back and accept the promise of the truth today and hold on to it for dear life Hallelujah the coming of the word gave you power over the lie and when the book was open the truth comes out and when the truth comes out he never had power over you when the truth comes out you're not really a failure when the truth comes out you're standing in Le oysa when the truth comes out you're the Bride of Jesus Christ makes me think of of hmon there in in Esther chapter 6 and he's already planning to hang Mori he's already built the Gallows thank you but one night the king couldn't sleep on and he said bring me bring me the book of Chronicles yeah and they bring in the book now hmon had been saying these people are against you these people are threatening to overthrow your kingdom these people can't stand that guy's a failure you died for him and all he does is fail all he does is let you down all he does is miss church all he does is Time After Time the king says bring me the book of remembrance I need to read and when the book's open the truth comes out when the book's open they were standing for me all along they were in Satan's Eden standing for me all along hymon you're a liar now you're going to go to The Gallows it was hmon that's a liar it's a hmon with no power but you your name is written in the book and it shows who you always were you were loyal you were true you stood in an evil day the book came open and reveal your true identity Hallelujah thank you Jesus and it goes on from Luther's day and goes into Philadelphia age and the messenger John Wesley and more is unfolded and more is unveiled with the message of sanctification more is unfolded more power is released during the isua movement and then Malachi 4 comes on the seene I think you see where we're going we built from Genesis to Jesus and we're building from acts to Jesus Malachi 4 comes on the scene Revelation 10:7 and once again it's completely unfolded once again the fullness of the word the scripture said the mystery of God is finished and yet somehow somewhere people get the idea that with the coming of the word we're supposed to lay aside the power that came with it lay aside the life that came with it to try to make that a thing of the past and it's the same spirit that worked through the church carinal there in the first age anointed by the Judah Spirit to sell out the birthright to lay aside the power brother Bram says this man comes to him and says you're trying to make people believe in an Apostolic age to live today like they were in the apostolic age so the apostolic age ceased with the apostles brother Brown said it did listen I think you came too late to tell that man he said yeah I said who was the spokesman in the apostolic age he said the 12 apostles in the upper room I said then Paul was out I said the spokesman was Peter and Peter said on the day of Pentecost when they seen all this going on in the Holy Ghost work and he said the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that's a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall ever call if he is still calling then the same thing is here when did the apostolic age cease then the apostolic age ceases when God ceases to call he never did say a thing but picked up his hat and walked away wrong fell to argue with the apostolic age doesn't cease as long as God is calling amen and we can't be deniers we We Can't Stop short that's the Jud Spirit stopping short walk right up to it walk up and see the truth and then walk away from Pentecost we can't settle for just a good life and we can't settle for just justification and sanctification and and we can't settle for just having gifts we don't want that we're not going backwards there's more for us the fullness is for us we have more power because truth in powers and the fullness of the truth has been restored brother Brandon would go through it like this he said justification brought power he said it was horse power he said the horse and buggy he said but they had power he said but then sanctification come and brought more power he said now they never done away with the power they added to it he said now they had more power it was automobile power he says Asuza brought airplane power he said they got off the ground he said no they didn't do away with the horse and buggy they didn't do away with the car Power they added to it listen he says and when the Pentecostals found the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the restoration of the gifts they never Divi denied sanctification or justif ification they just got more power and raised up and went up because he found more power see but the unveiling didn't stop at isua but now friends now friends may I say this it has come to the age of the astronaut we have moved out of the airplane age we've got more power now the astronaut age has come in what is it we've come into the spiritual age of astronauts see going above it's the same Spirit only more power only lifted higher can go higher see more believe more be more like Christ not the automobile not the horse and buggy not even the airplane but the astronaut he sweeps on and above each one I'm not going back to the airplane I'm not going back to the car I'm not going back to the horse and buggy I've stepped into the astronaut age I'm going above and beyond each one I'm going past the Sun pass the moon past the Stars I'm going all the way as far as I can go with more power Hallelujah more power why is there more power brother Arion Aron Arion I renamed myself why is there more power for the very reason people think there's less power there's more power because the Mysteries have been revealed there's more more power because the seals have been open and with more truth comes more power he doesn't go backwards it's always more more of God released more of his nature more of his victory more of his healing more of his Joy I want you to notice the attitude of the Prophet speaking in the fifth seal it isn't now we have the word so we don't have to worry about any more healings we don't have to worry about Deliverance anymore this is him in the fifth seal I believe I'm not going to speak it in his name I'm going to speak it in the revelation of my faith what happened in Sabino Canyon the other day when the sword come down to him I believe that the hour is approaching when missing limbs will be restored you're telling me that the coming of the word raised the prophet's expectations for greater healings it raised his expectations for more power not less and the glorious power of the Creator I believe if he can make a squirrel appear that he here is the man or woman just got a part missing that's a complete animal he is God I love him brother Brown seeing the unveiling the the unveiling of power the unveiling of the word he expects more and he expects greater he has greater expectations now than ever for God to move in a mighty way for God to manifest and and after the revealing of the word the expectations for the Supernatural and for the healings go higher what is it was the unveiling of even more power the unveiling of Greater to the prophet the coming word meant more power not more theology yes correct doctrines but correct doctrines bring more power because the claim of the devil has been broken the devil is exposed and is exposing as we saw his grip is completely broken the light begins to shine in the last day it shows who the devil really is light shines and the Revelation strikes and you see who you really are and when you see that and you recognize the authority that you have in your position that allows you to operate the power of God what power are you talking about brother Aaron power to be an overcomer power to overcome the devil power to overcome leosia power power to overcome lukewarm spirit Power for the supernatural power for a Rapture and as we bring this down today knowing that it's all been revealed so the fullness is here I ask you what are your expectations what are your expectations because I'm expecting more with the release of the full word came the fullness of the Holy Ghost now listen other ages had por ions and it was enough power for that time if you were birthed under a previous outpouring it was good for that time you only had a portion if you were birthed under the isua movement you only had a portion now let's make it clear you may have received the fullness of what was allotted but it wasn't all allotted you did not receive the same New Birth Earth in 1950 that's available right now to you amen cuz the fullness of the word wasn't open so the fullness of the Holy Ghost could not be here it was good for that age it's good for the airplane age and it' get you off the ground it would get you off the ground but it won't work today because today the fullness has come and so I ask you this turn your thinking just a little what are you veiling this morning who are you the fullness has come in flesh again yeah where who you you've got to start recognizing this and quit facing the devil trembling Jesus never want one time trembled when he faced the devil he never one time was afraid of a situation and I'm telling you I understand our human aspects I understand our human emotions but you're veiling God on the inside of you tonight what was on the inside of Jesus this isn't some anointing we're talking about here in the last day this isn't some partial and as I bring this down to a close I'm going to read quite a few quotes from from the unveiling of God as he deals with this and these go in order not ex I mean there's places where I skip some paragraphs to get to the next quote but they're in order and you see him building this thought he says they said there is no such thing as prophets there is no such thing in these last days as Apostles and Prophets there's no such thing as Divine Healing there's no such thing as Sears anymore there's no such thing as Mark 16 being fulfilled Apostolic age is done they veiled it from the people but God walked right out with his holy spirit of fire and rent that thing from the top to bottom God has rent The Veil he said it is too it is today too it's called a bunch of Holy Rollers fanatics but they don't know what's hid behind there W my he said that's what they don't know see then when God in Mercy rent The Veil for them to see they were so wrapped up in their Traditions don't let us get so wrapped up in message traditions we don't see him moving so wrapped up and well we been here for 2 hours that we don't see him [Music] moving it was still hid to them even to this day same now the glory the power of the Holy Spirit The shakana Glory that comes upon the believer now I mean the real believer that causes the works of God and the faith to come into him to believe the word of God that's all hid to them eyes they say them things just passed you see they're still living behind the veil you're not behind the veil anymore little ones God has come in full full view to you Hallelujah I'm going to keep going just bear with me he says so now we are invited into him to be partakers of all that he is we're invited into him which is hid to unbelievers by the veil of human flesh see they know that Glory they read of it it's in the word the glory of God things like that it's just a word to them we've got the word we no it's just a word to them to us it's a manifestation see it is no more a word it's a reality amen God said let there be light that was the word but now there is light it ain't the word it's the light that was the word but now there is light he says see what I mean now it isn't just a written word word to us it's a reality next sentence we are him well we don't we just don't have the power that used to come during the healing you're right we're beyond that power it's even greater now than it was then the word is open we are him whatever power he had we have today we are him now we're enjoying now we Behold Him now we see him the word word manifesting himself where in you it's HD out there because why it's veiled in human flesh look I'm going to be honest I think the biggest problem we have isn't even seeing God in our brother it's seeing God in us I might know two or three of your flaws I know all 682 of mine I was being generous there's probably more so it's hard to accept it about yourself but it's here what was the point of all this a defeated people no God in flesh again God again in a people doing the works that he did John 14:12 Mark 16 in action finishing what wasn't finished in the ministry of Christ finishing the ministry of his bride how can you do the ministry of the bridegroom if you're not the same like he was in Moses these are all come from the same service one after another it's an incredible sermon you should listen to it when the word was in Moses he was God in flesh when it was in Jesus it was God in flesh see only thing he done was change his mask not his word not his nature he is the same yesterday today and forever he only changed his form he changed from Noah to Moses he changed from Moses to David from David to Joseph on down till he come into the fullness of the godhead bodily that was Jesus Christ see it's still the same God amen amen I hope that gets through see it's the same God but he just takes on another Veil see he puts on another Veil he did it in the reformers taking on a veil taken on a veil until finally it come down through the Lutheran age down through the other age then finally it comes out in the complete the fullness oh Jesus was the fullness his bride is the fullness says now Moses was the word that day because the word was given to him for that day Moses Joseph was the word in his days portraying Christ exactly see each one of them was the word and when Jesus came he was the word in its fullness because the whole Plan of Redemption laid in him the whole Plan of Redemption didn't lay in Moses didn't lay in Joseph didn't lay in Elijah see they were only part of the word pointing to it just like Luther was pointing to it Wesley was pointing to it isua was pointing to it now notice keep your thought here it comes as I say see the whole plan wasn't in them they were pointing to it can I tell you something this morning even like Tabernacle we're not pointing to it we're no longer pointing there's not an age to come the fullness of the word is here the fullness of the word has been restored Jesus the fullness veiled in flesh 2,000 years ago and now bone of is bone and now flesh of is flesh and now power is power the fullness of the word is here this morning it's in a bride of Jesus Christ a worldwide body and you are a point a part of that fullness veiled to the unbeliever but unveiled to the believer the word is unveiled the power is unveiled I ask you this morning what can stand before you what's hindering you what sickness What Fear what complex what torment this morning can stand before you the truth has exposed the lie you are a free bride this morning you are the fullness of the word once again veiled in flesh he says and as a Christian I'm identified with him this is this is powerful amen I was with Noah when he went in the ark I was with Moses when he come out of Egypt amen I Was Elijah on Mount Caramel yes sir glory to God I was with him when he did that I was truly with him when you read this don't read it as brother brandham saying it put your name in there ah ah you know what read it with me I'm going to slow down a little bit I'm going start with I was truly with him I identified myself in his death there on Calvary I want class participation read along with me out loud thank you I identified myself in his death there on Calvary when I died to the things of the world to myself in all Traditions I was identified with him I was identified with him on Easter morning when he rose from the dead I was identified with him on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came down like a rushing Mighty Wind I was identified with him all that he was I am all that I am he was brother and ain't making this up this morning the prophet of God says you are him he's not he's that where at devil the fullness of the word of God is manifested in flesh again today in a bride body Hallelujah he has placed his fullness in the bride he has revealed himself to her and now she is here to finish the work so I ask you what's on the inside of us this morning it's the same one that walked on water it's the same one that spoke to storms it's the same one that defeated death Hell In The Grave it's the same one that resurrected it's the same one that came back on the day of Pentecost it's the same one that opened the seals it's the same Jesus Christ today living in you and living in me Hallelujah he says notice the old Veil that hid the glory the old Badger skins there was no Beauty to be desired of it neither was his flesh that's the reason people said a little old stooped over fell like that probably 30 years old and gray and his beard gray wasn't much to look at the Bible said there's no Beauty we should desire him he didn't look like a king the old Badger skin but oh what was on the inside he says in a little bunch of Holy Rollers sitting together in a hot building like this they call them not much Beauty to be desired but what's on the inside this morning the fullness of Jesus Christ has returned Hallelujah Oh Glory now if we can all just get our mind in one Spirit one Accord let the directors get in the right spirit with the musicians and with the composer everything will be all right then he says no guesswork about it we are identified with him then Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever we're identified with him in Acts to we're identified with them with the same baptism ISM same thing all he was then and all he is all he was and all he is we are that's exactly it how's he able to preach like this it's after the seals and he's recognizing it's the fullness it's the fullness Hallelujah I got so many quotes left here I'm going to skip a couple for y'all sake down to the countdown talk about power he says' one these mornings God's achievement of his astronauts that's climbed into Jesus Christ been born and there by the Holy Ghost filled with his power one of these mornings the whole universe will be screaming and wailing and nashing of teeth when they see they've missed it when the Great Eagle powered by the Holy Ghost and Fire begins to spread her wings the astronauts will take off into the sky to go meet the bridegroom when the Bri takes off in the astronaut power of God Almighty who sent Jesus Christ to the Earth in the form of the Holy Ghost has brought the church through these achievements until now she's getting resurrected power in her church don't ever let anybody come and tell you the days of Miracles has passed don't ever let anybody tell you God don't do these things no more and God don't move like that anymore oh brother Aaron we've got the word yes we sure do and I thank God for it because the opening of that word is what Rel released the power that I need to overcome it released the power that I need to take a Rapture it's unveiled the power to us and we're getting ready to leave here but before we go whether we're here another 6 months another 12 months another two years or another five years it don't matter what I know is I've got quickening power on the inside of me so before I go I'm expecting great things I'm expecting Miracles I'm expecting these pews to get so full of prodical that we ain't got nowhere to put them I'm expecting healing I'm expecting deliverances why we've got the power we got more than we've ever had what devil can stand before us we are the Bride of Jesus Christ and the fullness has come and with the fullness the power has been released to us to be the Overcomers of the age I'm telling you 2,000 years ago the last words that were spoken to the Jewish dispensation it cried out through human lips it is finished and one of these days the last words is going to cry out to the Gentile dispensation of the leoan church Age The Bride will cry out it is finished we finished the race we're taking a body change we're going in a Rapture how quickening Power released to us by the opening of the word in this day praise the name of the Lord bless the name of the Lord and we got the word thank God and we've got the power of the word has been released in this day thank you Jesus Hallelujah he's here today in the fullness of his power all things are possible I said all things are possible let that Revelation strike you this morning all things are possible all things are possible Hall thank you Jesus all that he was we are Church he's here today in the fullness of his word which mean if you can find it in the word it's here he's a deliverer in the word he's here as a deliverer he's a Healer in the word he's here as a Healer he's a savior in the word he's here as a savior he's a comforter in the word he's here is a comforter he he fill you with the Holy Ghost it says in the word he's here to fill you with the Holy Ghost everything we're not operating in a portion we don't have to go in portions anymore I'm going to tell you this though I ain't throwing no portions away I want everything I want my expectation to match that of the Prophet who when the seals were open he says now I expect for missing limbs to be restored you know I say it a lot I say it a lot because it's on my heart a lot I look at this as a church body it's a body I'm expecting limbs to be restored to the body I'm expecting hurts to be made right I'm expecting the bomb and Gilead to men relationships I'm expecting missing limbs to come walking back through that door missing eyes to come walking back through that door I'm expecting it I'm expecting it cuz it's in the word the prodical son ain't just a story so you can make skits about it and tell a good story it's there so you know mine's coming back just like that but I ask you what are your expectations are you looking for them are you looking down that road are you expecting your healing are you expecting your deliverance are you expecting your outpouring I need an outpouring then come get it it's all here the fullness has returned where brother Aaron you are a part of that fullness a worldwide body doing the works of Jesus Christ conquering where he conquered healing where he healed listen No No Man's A Healer but you know exactly what I mean I love it where it says they brought all manner of sick to him Jesus had prayer lines we're going to do what the bridegroom did we're going to operate exactly like Peter when he went to her and he said arise where did he learn that an example set before him listen you can pull all your ideas you want I've got an example set before me I've got an example set before me and I'm going to walk in the fullness of that example and be all that he called me to be even like Tac well don't settle short don't stop short you know there are scriptures there in the Book of Judges and it starts listing the tribes and it says neither did they and neither did they neither did they they went to the promised land but neither did they drive out neither did they drive out neither did they drive out I don't want to be a neither did they I don't want that of Ean like Tabernacle I don't want it set of my home of my life but I want to be like Caleb when he was 85 and they finally got into the land and they finally gave him his Mountain the very first thing he did was what they said couldn't be done it says they gave him Hein and he expelled the three sons of an I
