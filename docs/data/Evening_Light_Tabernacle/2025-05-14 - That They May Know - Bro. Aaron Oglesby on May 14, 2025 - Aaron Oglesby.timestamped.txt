[24:37] has been set aside, Lord, dedicated to
[24:40] the service of the Lord. And Father,
[24:42] thank you for the message you've given
[24:43] us in this hour, Lord. where many are
[24:45] groping in darkness. Lord, there's a
[24:48] light just been shining, Lord
[24:50] God. Shining out to the bride, Lord,
[24:53] calling her by name. Come out of her, my
[24:54] people. Be not partakers of our sins.
[24:57] And Lord, we as a people have come out
[24:59] of the denominational systems and come
[25:01] out of the lives of sin, Lord. And we're
[25:03] here tonight to present our tokens to

[25:20] that lays in Jesus Christ is in past
[25:23] tense. It's already done. It's a
[25:25] finished work. You said by your stripes
[25:29] that he's already healed. So, Father,
[25:32] according to that redemptive right that
[25:35] he has in the word of God, we're play
[25:38] praying tonight that the pain and the
[25:40] suffering leave his body, Lord. and that
[25:43] body are coming into obedience to the

[26:07] understanding to this word. And God, the

[26:13] will stay the hand of the enemy tonight,
[26:16] Lord. And may healing be their portion.

[26:47] will be gathered in your name. Lord, you
[26:49] promised you'd be in our midst. Lord,

[37:50] alone. He's my comfort.
[37:57] Oh, he's my
[38:00] comfort and he
[38:03] always holds me close.
[38:13] [Music]
[38:17] Hallelujah. I am not alone.
[38:23] [Music]
[38:26] Hallelujah. Can we thank him for that
[38:28] this evening,
[38:30] Lord? That you promised that you would
[38:32] never leave us or forsake us.
[38:34] Lord, we stand here, Lord, in the midst
[38:36] of Satan's Eden. And we can testify that
[38:38] the word is true. Lord, we are not
[38:41] alone. We are not fighting our battles
[38:43] alone. But you, oh Lord, have gone
[38:45] before us. You, oh Lord, are fighting
[38:47] our battles, and you, oh Lord, are
[38:49] bringing us victory. We praise you for
[38:51] that tonight, Lord. We thank you for
[38:53] that, Lord. Lord, as we turn now and
[38:55] look to your word, I just pray that you
[38:57] would bless the reading of it, Lord.
[38:59] That you would take control of this
[39:00] service, Lord. that all things we say
[39:02] and do would Lord bring glory to you,
[39:04] all things be done and said in the right
[39:06] spirit, Lord. Lord, that that we all
[39:08] would understand, Father, that we just
[39:10] want to lift up the name of Jesus and be
[39:12] more like you each and every day. Grant,
[39:15] Father, I pray that you'll just anoint
[39:17] our lips and anoint our ears, Father, as
[39:19] we give you this service. In Jesus name
[39:21] we pray. Amen and amen. Amen. God bless
[39:26] you this evening. Amen. And if you have
[39:28] your have your Bibles and you'd like to
[39:30] turn with me to 2 Samuel
[39:34] 9. 2 Samuel
[39:36] 9, we'll read from verse
[39:39] one. Amen. Isn't it good to be a
[39:42] Christian? Amen. It's good to be in the
[39:44] house of God here on this midweek
[39:46] service and come together with believers
[39:48] of like precious faith. Amen.
[39:52] Hallelujah. Amen. And just kind of a if
[39:55] we gave it a title tonight, we would
[39:57] call this thought that that they may
[39:59] know. And if I just kind of give a
[40:01] little synopsis of where we're going,
[40:03] you know, I just I believe that we are
[40:05] great recipients of of the outpouring of
[40:08] the love of Jesus Christ. And and and
[40:11] and along with the fullness of time and
[40:14] the fullness of the restore word, I
[40:15] believe we live in an age where the
[40:17] fullness of his love has been poured out
[40:19] upon us. And and because of that, I
[40:23] believe that we have a responsibility to
[40:25] show that love to others.
[40:27] We have a responsibility to to project
[40:30] that love out of our lives. So I would
[40:32] speak tonight on that they may know. And
[40:35] it says here in 2 Samuel 9 and1, and
[40:40] David said, is there yet any that is
[40:43] left of the house of Saul that I may
[40:46] show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?
[40:49] And there was of the house of Saul a
[40:51] servant whose name was Zeba. And when
[40:54] they had called him unto David, the king
[40:56] said unto him, "Art thou Zeba?" And he
[40:58] said, "Thy servant is
[41:01] he?" And the king said, "Is there not
[41:04] yet any of the house of Saul, that I may
[41:08] show the kindness of God unto him?" And
[41:11] Zebas said unto the king, Jonathan hath
[41:13] yet a son, which is lame on his feet.
[41:16] And the king said unto him, "Where is
[41:18] he?" And Zeba said unto the king,
[41:20] "Behold, he is in the house of Macker,
[41:23] the son of Amile, and Loar." Then King
[41:26] David sent and fetched him out of the
[41:28] house of Macker, the son of Amile, from
[41:32] Loar. And I also want to read one verse
[41:35] here in 1 John 4:11. And it says,
[41:38] "Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought
[41:42] also to love one another." Amen. I pray
[41:46] that Lord will bless his word as you
[41:48] have your seats this evening.
[41:51] Amen. It's just it's good to be a
[41:54] Christian, isn't it? Amen. It's good to
[41:56] serve him. I'm thankful for that
[41:58] opportunity. And and I'll even say it's
[42:00] an awesome time as as a Christian to be
[42:02] alive. What a time to be living in. And
[42:05] and it's wonderful to be standing at a
[42:08] time where where prophecy is coming to
[42:09] pass, you know, and and I know all of
[42:11] you are aware in the wonderful job
[42:13] brother Tim did Sunday of of tying up
[42:15] all those those things and those
[42:17] prophecies that we see right before us.
[42:19] And and it's an exciting time where
[42:22] where we see the events around us
[42:24] wrapping up the fullness of time and and
[42:26] we have that a privilege to see those
[42:29] events clearer than anyone because
[42:31] they've been made clear by prophecy to
[42:34] us. Amen. And and I'm thankful that in
[42:36] his love and in his mercy that that God
[42:38] didn't allow things to come upon us in
[42:40] this day unaware, but but he sent a
[42:43] message and he opened our eyes to it.
[42:45] And he allowed us to see things that
[42:47] that ages have longed to see that that
[42:49] prophets and ministers and priests and
[42:52] that have longed to live in this time.
[42:54] And yet you're privileged to live in it.
[42:56] And not only live in it, but be aware of
[42:58] it. The fact that you are living in the
[43:01] last day. Amen. and and and I'm thankful
[43:04] for that. And God does that because God
[43:07] is determined to have a people upon the
[43:09] earth. He He's a determined God. And he
[43:12] was determined to have a people. And and
[43:14] he was determined even from the very
[43:16] beginning that his plan wouldn't fail.
[43:19] And whether you realize it or or not
[43:21] tonight, you are proof that his plan has
[43:24] worked. You are proof that what God has
[43:27] set in order has is coming to pass. And
[43:30] despite Satan's best effort, and despite
[43:32] the attacks down through the ages, and
[43:34] despite the failures of men, there is a
[43:37] people on the face of the earth tonight
[43:40] that are his people. Amen. They've been
[43:43] called for his name's sake. And they've
[43:45] received his life and and they're
[43:47] staying true to the word. Amen. That
[43:49] that's what we're doing. And and and
[43:51] they've been covered in his grace and
[43:52] and they've been wrapped in his kindness
[43:54] and they're recipients of his love. And
[43:57] it's not because we deserved it. It's
[43:59] not because we earned it. We were we
[44:01] were no better than anybody else. But
[44:03] it's because God loved us. Amen. Amen.
[44:07] He loved us. And And I don't want us to
[44:10] ever lose sight of that. He loved you
[44:13] when you were unlovable. And I'll just
[44:15] say it to me so you don't think I'm
[44:17] throwing darts at you. He loved me when
[44:19] I was unlovable. And And he saved us
[44:22] when it wasn't even our will to be
[44:25] saved. It it wasn't man going around
[44:28] looking for a savior, but it was a
[44:30] savior going around looking for his
[44:32] children and and looking to draw all men
[44:34] unto him. Amen. Brother Brandham says,
[44:37] "Now, the first thing I'm getting to
[44:38] there is to know this that it's God's
[44:42] grace that any of you are saved today."
[44:45] Amen. It wasn't your will to be saved.
[44:48] Man by nature is a rebellion against
[44:51] God. Man by nature is a rebellion
[44:54] against God. and he rebelled in the
[44:57] Garden of Eden. He's fallen from grace
[44:59] and he's run from God and he hid from
[45:01] God. And it's the nature of man to do
[45:05] that. It was the nature of many of us to
[45:07] do that. I I ran from God and I ran from
[45:09] God even though he called me, even
[45:11] though he drew me. I sat on a message
[45:13] pew and I heard sermon after sermon
[45:15] after sermon. Went through youth camp
[45:17] after youth camp after youth camp. But I
[45:19] was running because there was rebellion
[45:21] in me towards God. There was something
[45:23] in man that thinks I can do this. I can
[45:26] overcome. I can make it on my own. I
[45:28] want to tell you tonight, it's by grace
[45:30] that you're going to make it. It's
[45:31] because God said, "I'm going to save
[45:34] you." And he called you and he chose
[45:36] you. And it was unmmerited favor of God.
[45:40] That was the condition that we were all
[45:42] in. Lost, rebelling, no hope. That's
[45:47] been the condition ever since ever since
[45:49] man fell there there in the garden. And
[45:52] and you you know man messed up the most
[45:54] perfect situation.
[45:56] Man was given a perfect situation. They
[45:59] were in perfect bodies in a perfect
[46:01] garden fellowshipping with a perfect God
[46:04] in perfect harmony. Amen. And they
[46:07] messed that up.
[46:10] Listen, we can't do nothing on our own.
[46:12] If man can mess that up, we'll mess up
[46:14] anything. You know, I've said it before.
[46:17] Anytime that I've tried to do things on
[46:19] my own, I end up a failure. Anytime I
[46:21] think I got something figured out, I
[46:23] don't. But anytime I put my hand in his
[46:26] hand and I let him lead me and I let him
[46:29] guide me and I let him take me through
[46:30] the situation, I haven't failed one time
[46:33] because God cannot fail.
[46:36] Amen. Man messed up this situation in
[46:39] perfect harmony. And in a moment's time,
[46:42] in a moment's time, it was all thrown
[46:44] away.
[46:46] They had never felt fear. They had never
[46:48] felt anxiety. They had never worried.
[46:50] They none of that. And then all of a
[46:51] sudden, can you imagine what it felt
[46:52] like when all that came rushing in?
[46:56] When all that came rushing in at once.
[46:58] And it was all lost. And it was all
[47:00] given over to a lie.
[47:04] All given over to a lie of God's enemy
[47:06] in direct
[47:08] disobedience of God's word. Not a
[47:11] mistake.
[47:13] Listen, the garden wasn't a mistake. It
[47:15] wasn't a oops, you didn't tell me.
[47:18] It was direct rebellion. He said don't
[47:22] and they did.
[47:25] And Eve knew he said don't because she
[47:27] told the serpent God said don't.
[47:32] Listen, I'm going to put it like this.
[47:33] It's actually quite easy to make a
[47:35] rapture. You follow directions.
[47:40] You follow directions. You'd be
[47:42] surprised how many kids when I taught
[47:43] school knew all the answers and would
[47:45] flunk the test because they didn't
[47:46] follow directions.
[47:48] Just read the directions. He gave us a
[47:50] handbook and he said, "Do this and
[47:53] you'll make it. Do this and you'll be
[47:55] there. Do this and you'll receive the
[47:57] Holy Ghost. Just repent. Be baptized.
[48:00] You shall receive the G." Listen, he's
[48:02] given us direct instructions in this
[48:04] day. And just in case we didn't
[48:06] understand it, he sent a message in this
[48:08] day to make it quite clear. just follow
[48:11] the directions.
[48:17] She had
[48:18] directions and she rebelled and and Adam
[48:21] rebelled and this was death.
[48:25] The law demanded it. All was lost and it
[48:29] seemed that Satan had won. Something had
[48:33] to die.
[48:35] So in that moment, God takes a
[48:38] substitute and a lamb is slain and and
[48:40] God takes those bloody sheep skins and
[48:42] his children are wrapped in it just so
[48:44] that they can stand in his presence for
[48:46] a conference.
[48:48] Just so they can stand there so that
[48:50] judgment can be passed and they stand
[48:53] there as rebellious fallen man.
[48:58] Whatever you do, make sure you don't
[49:00] stand before him on that day clothed in
[49:02] your rebellious, fallen nature.
[49:06] You make sure you're wrapped up in the
[49:08] blood of the lamb. You make sure that
[49:10] you got that token on hand. Don't stand
[49:12] there in your body. Don't stand there in
[49:14] the body that you sinned in, lied in,
[49:16] had horrible thoughts in, did bad deeds
[49:18] in. No, sir. I want to stand there
[49:20] clothed in his righteousness. I want to
[49:22] stand there under the blood of Jesus. I
[49:24] want to stand there as a forgiven son of
[49:26] the living God. Accept that tonight and
[49:29] robe yourself in that tonight. Put that
[49:31] cloak on tonight.
[49:34] They stand there wrapped in these lamb
[49:36] skkins and judgment is passed.
[49:41] says, "And then when I see Adam, as it
[49:43] was standing there, and Eve, the
[49:45] beautiful stature of her, and while
[49:46] she's standing there, these old bloody
[49:48] sheep skkins, the blood running down her
[49:50] legs, and Adam and his great fine
[49:53] stature of a man, the blood of these
[49:55] sheepkins running down him, and God
[49:57] standing there pronouncing death,
[50:01] sorrow, heartaches, destruction."
[50:05] Watch, he says. Then I see Eve put her
[50:08] lovely head over on Adam's shoulder.
[50:10] him. Put his arms around her. They start
[50:12] weeping. Turned around, started walking
[50:14] out of his presence. God, depart from
[50:17] him. He sinned. There's your judgment.
[50:22] But in that moment, something happened
[50:24] that Satan could never comprehend and he
[50:27] will never be able to comprehend because
[50:30] it's not in him to do it. In that
[50:32] moment, God loved. In that moment, God
[50:35] loved in their sin. God loved in their
[50:38] failure. God loved and he came down and
[50:41] love project and he said, "Wait, wait.
[50:45] I'm going to come with you. I'm going to
[50:47] send a redeemer to redeem you back and
[50:50] buy you back." Satan said they got to
[50:52] die. And God said, "No, I'll die for
[50:54] them because I love them."
[50:58] Love projected.
[51:00] Hallelujah.
[51:02] Love took over.
[51:04] I'm so thankful that love took over. And
[51:07] in that
[51:08] moment says, "Then I could see all that
[51:11] great spaceless eternity come forming
[51:13] down in a funnel to four little letters,
[51:16] L O V E. He loved his children so much
[51:19] till he couldn't turn them away."
[51:21] Listen, let that sink in tonight. He
[51:25] loves you so much, he won't turn you
[51:26] away. Well, I'm seeking this. I'm
[51:29] seeking the Holy Ghost. I'm seeking
[51:30] forgiveness. I'm seeking He won't turn
[51:32] you away. He loves you so much. He won't
[51:36] turn you away. Then I hear him say,
[51:39] "Stop. I'll put enmity between thy seed
[51:41] and the serpent's seed." Promising a
[51:43] redeemer. God making preparation to
[51:48] redeem.
[51:50] Hallelujah. Even though man rebelled,
[51:53] even though man had become enemies to
[51:55] God, even though from that time on it
[51:57] would be constant sin, constant strife,
[52:00] constant backsliding, enmity against
[52:02] God, doubting God, questioning God, the
[52:05] nature of God in that moment comes
[52:08] visible right from the beginning. Oh,
[52:11] I'm going to love them. Oh, hallelujah.
[52:15] I'm going to love them through it all.
[52:17] I'm going to love them when they fail.
[52:19] I'm going to love them when they
[52:20] stumble. I'm gonna love them when they
[52:22] rebel. And there's nothing that the
[52:24] devil can do that's going to stop me
[52:26] from loving them. Oh, hallelujah. I love
[52:30] them so much that I'm going to leave
[52:31] heaven. I love them so much I'm going to
[52:34] come down and take a beating. I'm going
[52:36] to take stripes. I'm going to be spit
[52:37] on. I'm going to be mocked. I'm going to
[52:39] be crucified. And that's not the end of
[52:41] it. I love them so much. I'm going to go
[52:43] to hell for him. And I'm going to
[52:45] conquer death, hell, and the grave
[52:47] because I love them so much. Hallelujah.
[52:52] I'm going to love them through it all.
[52:56] Oh, think about it tonight. Think about
[52:59] it tonight. Oh, brother Aaron, surely
[53:01] I've spurned his mercy. Surely I've
[53:03] turned him against me. Oh, I've been
[53:06] struggling so long. The devil's against
[53:08] me at all times. My family's falling
[53:10] apart. My attitude isn't right. I got so
[53:13] many trials, so many struggles. Surely
[53:16] he can't still love me.
[53:19] Woo! Who is he that condemnth? It is
[53:21] Christ that died. Yay, rather that is
[53:24] risen again, who is even at the right
[53:26] hand of God, who also maketh
[53:28] intercession for us. Who shall separate
[53:30] us from the love of Christ? Oh,
[53:32] hallelujah. Shall tribulation or
[53:34] distress or persecution or famine or
[53:37] nakedness or peril or sword? No. As it
[53:41] is written, for thy sake we are killed
[53:43] all the day long. We are count as sheep
[53:45] for the slaughter. Nay, in all these
[53:47] things we are more than conquerors
[53:49] through him that loved us. For I am
[53:51] persuaded that neither death nor life,
[53:54] nor angels, nor principalities, nor
[53:57] powers, nor things present, or the
[54:00] trials coming up ahead. Hallelujah. nor
[54:03] height, nor depth, nor any other
[54:05] creature shall be able to separate us
[54:07] from the love of God which is in Christ
[54:10] Jesus our Lord.
[54:12] Nothing,
[54:14] nothing, nothing, your failures, your
[54:18] backsliding, your rebellion, nothing. He
[54:22] loves you tonight.
[54:24] Hallelujah.
[54:26] He loves you. Listen, if that don't make
[54:30] you want to serve him, oh, if that don't
[54:33] make you want to give your life to him,
[54:35] if that don't make you just want to
[54:37] surrender everything you got to him
[54:39] tonight, oh,
[54:41] hallelujah. Hallelujah. His perfect love
[54:43] for you should create a love so strong
[54:46] for him.
[54:48] Hallelujah. Where you going to find love
[54:50] like that?
[54:53] Where you going to find something like
[54:54] that? You ain't going to find it in the
[54:55] world. No sir. You ain't going to find
[54:58] it nowhere else.
[55:00] This Listen, I wouldn't fight it. I
[55:02] wouldn't doubt it. I wouldn't question
[55:04] it. I just give in to it tonight. I just
[55:06] surrender to it tonight. Lord, you love
[55:09] me so much. I'm just going to surrender
[55:10] to it tonight and let you have control
[55:13] of my life. Hallelujah. It's a love that
[55:15] cannot fail.
[55:18] Hallelujah. His love has been projecting
[55:21] out to man ever since the fall.
[55:24] We saw it in our opening scripture, the
[55:27] spirit of Christ in
[55:29] David. Think about this. He says, "And
[55:33] the king
[55:34] said, is there not yet any of the house
[55:38] of Saul that I may show the kindness of
[55:41] God
[55:43] unto?" Let me put it to you like this.
[55:47] Is there not
[55:50] somebody that's part of my greatest
[55:53] enemy
[55:55] of the one who tried to kill me over and
[55:58] over and over? Is there not somebody
[56:00] from his house that I can show the love
[56:03] of God to
[56:05] that I can forgive? That's that I can
[56:08] bury the hatchet with that I can move on
[56:11] with. Can't you find my worst enemy?
[56:17] Think about it.
[56:20] Brother Brandham many times would give
[56:22] examples down through the Old Testament
[56:24] and say it was the spirit of Christ in
[56:26] those characters doing those things.
[56:31] This was the spirit of Christ in
[56:33] David reaching out to those who had
[56:36] rebelled against, reaching out to those
[56:38] who had fought against, reaching out to
[56:40] those who were enemies of God.
[56:45] It was Christ in Noah. It's Christ in
[56:47] Abraham. Christ in Moses. It was Christ
[56:51] in
[56:52] David. And the thing is, as we kind of
[56:54] slow down here and and settle here for
[56:56] just a minute, I don't believe that it's
[56:58] just something that should be said about
[57:00] Bible characters.
[57:05] It's not Christ in David, the hope of
[57:07] glory.
[57:09] Christ in Moses.
[57:12] And let's just get real. It ain't Christ
[57:14] in Brother Tim
[57:16] or Christ in Brother Aaron or Christ in
[57:18] Brother Brandham or Brother Joe or you
[57:19] name it. It's got to be Christ in you. I
[57:23] will never get you to heaven. The
[57:26] preacher will never get you there. He
[57:28] will never legislate to you an
[57:30] overcoming life. It's got to be Christ
[57:34] in you.
[57:38] And if it's Christ in you, then the
[57:41] nature and the life that he projected
[57:44] out from those characters will also
[57:47] project out of you. Think about his his
[57:50] great attributes of love and and grace
[57:53] will project out of you. The love of God
[57:57] as we've just went through for the first
[57:58] few minutes was projected so mightily to
[58:01] us. The kindness of God was projected to
[58:04] us. The goodness of God was projected to
[58:06] us and if we have received of that then
[58:10] we have a
[58:11] responsibility to project it to others.
[58:17] David was looking for an
[58:19] opportunity to show the love of God. Now
[58:24] I I believe that godly
[58:26] men seek opportunity
[58:29] to do good works. All right.
[58:33] They seek
[58:36] opportunity. This isn't, well, if I get
[58:39] stuck at the same table with that guy
[58:40] and I have no choice,
[58:43] I think I'll speak to
[58:46] him. Or you know how it is. You're
[58:48] coming out the bathroom, you open the
[58:49] door, and he's coming
[58:51] in. I just watched him. I did.
[58:59] And we're just going to be real tonight.
[59:01] That's that's all I know how to
[59:05] be. We have those people that we take
[59:09] opportunity to avoid.
[59:15] And it's not
[59:17] because they're not cool. It's usually
[59:20] because of hurt feelings.
[59:23] hard situations,
[59:25] things that you've never let go or you
[59:27] think they've never let go, or a grudge
[59:30] or a bitterness, and at best they get a
[59:40] godly men seek opportunity to do good
[59:43] works.
[59:46] I guess I'll shake his hand if we pass
[59:48] in the hallway.
[59:50] What we read was an
[59:52] intentional seeking to show kindness
[59:57] to someone that it probably was not easy
[1:00:00] to show kindness to
[1:00:04] an intentional
[1:00:06] seeking. Now listen, this is going to
[1:00:09] get real simple for a minute, maybe for
[1:00:12] a few minutes, maybe for the rest of it.
[1:00:16] But I think sometimes we get so elevated
[1:00:18] in our knowledge and in our
[1:00:21] understanding that some of the simple
[1:00:23] things get lost.
[1:00:27] The very foundational things that we
[1:00:29] learned in Sunday school. Listen, when
[1:00:32] we go from those rooms to these rooms,
[1:00:35] sometimes we forget that that's where
[1:00:36] the foundation was laid there and at
[1:00:39] home with mom and daddy and the Bible
[1:00:41] stories and do unto others.
[1:00:47] So simple things are important things
[1:00:51] because we sometimes put them down, you
[1:00:53] know, a notch in importance. But the
[1:00:55] scripture elevates these things into a
[1:00:57] place of great importance. Love thy
[1:01:00] neighbor as
[1:01:01] thyself. Estem others better than
[1:01:05] yourself.
[1:01:07] Just for those who don't know what that
[1:01:08] means, you are to consider that your
[1:01:10] brother is better than you.
[1:01:16] do unto others over and over. And I just
[1:01:20] picked a few of these scriptures because
[1:01:21] it's taught so often in the Bible. But
[1:01:25] here's a few. John 15:12. This is my
[1:01:28] commandment. It doesn't get any
[1:01:30] stronger. This isn't a suggestion. This
[1:01:32] is just like in the Garden of Eden.
[1:01:34] Don't
[1:01:37] these are the directions.
[1:01:39] This is my commandment. red letter that
[1:01:43] ye love one another. Well, there's
[1:01:45] different levels of love, brother Aaron.
[1:01:47] I can love people and not like
[1:01:50] them. That's there's a truth to
[1:01:55] that. But he takes that away.
[1:01:59] How do you love them? As I have loved
[1:02:04] you.
[1:02:06] That
[1:02:08] means be willing to die for them.
[1:02:15] That's going a lot further than just
[1:02:16] shaking hands when you pass in the
[1:02:18] hallway.
[1:02:21] Verse 17, these things I command
[1:02:24] you that you love one another. First
[1:02:29] Thessalonians 3:12. And the Lord make
[1:02:31] you to increase and abound in knowledge
[1:02:35] of the mysteries and message theology.
[1:02:41] No, no, no. Increase and abound in
[1:02:44] love one toward another. This may not
[1:02:47] seem like that big a deal, but we live
[1:02:48] in the age of self love.
[1:02:51] This is the hardest time ever to fulfill
[1:02:53] these scriptures because everything is
[1:02:56] selfishness and me and me and I and I
[1:02:58] and what I'm doing. I don't got time to
[1:03:00] help. I don't got time for this. I don't
[1:03:02] have time. Why don't you have time?
[1:03:05] Because like I've always
[1:03:06] said, you will make time for the things
[1:03:09] you think are important.
[1:03:12] What I found out through the years is
[1:03:14] that people tend to do what they want to
[1:03:15] do.
[1:03:17] They're going to do what they want to do
[1:03:19] and not do what they don't want to do.
[1:03:21] They prioritize things
[1:03:25] and toward well, okay, I can do it for
[1:03:27] people at Evening Light Tabernacle.
[1:03:29] Nope. All men.
[1:03:34] Got me
[1:03:35] again. Even as we do toward you. Let's
[1:03:40] go on with another one. You have heard
[1:03:42] that it hath been said that thou shalt
[1:03:44] love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy.
[1:03:47] But I say unto you, love your enemies,
[1:03:50] bless them that curse you, do good to
[1:03:53] them that hate
[1:03:55] you. Guys, it's okay. It was hard for
[1:03:58] me, too. I've just already got over it.
[1:04:02] I've just already accepted it.
[1:04:08] Pray for them which despitefully use you
[1:04:12] and persecute you.
[1:04:14] Now, is it really that big a deal? This
[1:04:18] next verse hit me like a ton of bricks.
[1:04:20] That ye may be children of your father
[1:04:24] which is in heaven. If you want to be a
[1:04:27] child of God,
[1:04:29] you're going to do these things.
[1:04:32] It isn't optional. Love your enemy. Do
[1:04:35] good to them that hate you. Bless them
[1:04:38] that curse you if you want to be my
[1:04:40] child.
[1:04:45] Help me, Lord.
[1:04:47] And then you find out real quick why
[1:04:50] people make the simple things a little
[1:04:52] bit of less important because these are
[1:04:55] harder things to actually practice.
[1:05:00] For most of you in here, it's easy to
[1:05:02] say, "God sent a prophet." That's easy.
[1:05:05] God sent a prophet. No problem with
[1:05:07] serpent seed. No problem saying the
[1:05:09] mysteries are revealed. No problem with
[1:05:11] baptism. I believe the message. Okay? If
[1:05:15] you do, then that means you love your
[1:05:17] enemies. You bless them that curse you.
[1:05:19] You do good to them that hate you. And
[1:05:20] you
[1:05:23] this is the real stuff. I'm proud that
[1:05:25] you know the doctrines. I'm proud. I'm
[1:05:27] so thankful for the message of the hour.
[1:05:30] But after you've ingested all of that,
[1:05:32] what is it producing in your life?
[1:05:36] What are you doing with it?
[1:05:41] Cuz we got to put the rubber on the
[1:05:43] road. We got to push the gas pedal. We
[1:05:45] got to go somewhere. Brother Aaron, I
[1:05:47] believe. Okay. Then love your enemies.
[1:05:53] I believe the message and I've accepted
[1:05:55] all the doctrines and I've been born
[1:05:56] again. Listen, I believe you.
[1:05:59] I really do. I don't unless somebody's
[1:06:02] just out being a ranked sinner, I ain't
[1:06:04] never going to rob their testimony.
[1:06:06] If you say it, I I believe you. I do.
[1:06:10] But why are you still so rude to people?
[1:06:16] Why are you mean as a snake?
[1:06:19] Why can't you stand correction?
[1:06:23] Why are you unforgiving to those that
[1:06:25] have wronged you? Listen, I just want to
[1:06:28] say it like this. We can't be separated
[1:06:30] from the world and even from
[1:06:32] denominations only by our doctrine.
[1:06:37] Our doctrine ain't walking up and down
[1:06:38] the streets.
[1:06:40] You are.
[1:06:47] Something should live out that shows
[1:06:51] that you are a recipient of his love.
[1:06:53] Amen. The way we live, the way we talk
[1:06:57] to people, the way we treat people
[1:07:00] should project the love of Jesus Christ
[1:07:02] onto and all around them.
[1:07:05] Our actions should show his love. Our
[1:07:08] attitudes should show his love. I'll
[1:07:11] just put like this. The lies of those
[1:07:13] walking in less light should not
[1:07:17] outshine the lives of those walking in
[1:07:20] full
[1:07:21] illumination. Right.
[1:07:25] Listen, I I I completely understand
[1:07:27] we're ar we're not saved by works.
[1:07:30] We we understand that it's not it's not
[1:07:32] even it's never been our emphasis where
[1:07:35] where you know it often is the focus of
[1:07:37] many of of of the denominations. We we
[1:07:40] believe in an experience that changes a
[1:07:42] life where the Holy Ghost of God comes
[1:07:44] in and indwells us. But that doesn't
[1:07:47] devalue the importance of good works
[1:07:51] because faith without works is dead.
[1:07:56] It doesn't devalue that. And I don't
[1:07:58] even mean feeding the poor, volunteering
[1:08:00] at the shelter, helping, you know, the
[1:08:02] widow. And those things are great and
[1:08:05] those things are wonderful. We should
[1:08:06] never speak on those things as if they
[1:08:08] aren't significant. They are
[1:08:10] significant.
[1:08:11] But I'm just talking about a life
[1:08:15] projecting out a life that shows Christ.
[1:08:20] However that manifest for you it may be
[1:08:22] helping the widow. For you it may but
[1:08:24] just a life that shows the love of
[1:08:27] Christ.
[1:08:29] What David said is there anyone even
[1:08:32] from my enemy's house that I can show
[1:08:34] kindness
[1:08:36] to? What really separates us?
[1:08:41] I'm gonna bring it down to home because
[1:08:44] you know used to we were out
[1:08:46] 546 White Oak Road I think was the
[1:08:49] address. Also known as in the middle of
[1:08:51] nowhere.
[1:08:55] We're not there anymore. And I know not
[1:08:58] all of you live in mind, but it's it's
[1:09:00] very interesting the um the dynamics now
[1:09:03] of our church in the city of Minden.
[1:09:06] They know us. They're associated with
[1:09:10] us. That relationship was established
[1:09:12] years ago even with brother Joe working
[1:09:13] at the hospital all those years. Now,
[1:09:15] Brother Derek and his family serve the
[1:09:18] town of Menon daily and and brother
[1:09:20] Jackson, brother Steven and the pool
[1:09:22] company and and they know our people.
[1:09:25] They they they've come to know us and
[1:09:28] and
[1:09:30] there I'm not worried about our
[1:09:33] reputation.
[1:09:35] It's not about that.
[1:09:37] It's about his reputation.
[1:09:42] It's about the reputation of this
[1:09:44] message and how we conduct
[1:09:48] ourselves. And Minden knows us.
[1:09:52] And the way you treat people, the way
[1:09:55] you speak to people, the way you conduct
[1:09:58] business, the way you treat employees,
[1:10:01] the way you treat employers, what you do
[1:10:03] when you think no one is looking, how
[1:10:05] you interact with employees at Walmart,
[1:10:07] how you treat your waitress.
[1:10:10] Those things have a much much larger
[1:10:14] influence and impact than any doctrine
[1:10:16] you could ever share with them.
[1:10:21] It has a much bigger impact than any
[1:10:23] modest apparel you may wear as you walk
[1:10:25] down the street.
[1:10:33] I say this halfway joking and yet I'm
[1:10:35] not joking at
[1:10:36] all. So I guess it's like a quarter
[1:10:39] joking if we're going to split the
[1:10:40] diction.
[1:10:43] But I often say I can tell a lot about a
[1:10:46] person by what they do with their
[1:10:47] shopping cart.
[1:10:51] Brother Aaron, that's so I'm just
[1:10:53] telling you.
[1:10:55] Get your door dained one time. You'll
[1:10:57] decize a few people for it, too. I tell
[1:10:59] you
[1:11:01] what they do with their shopping cart
[1:11:03] and how they treat a waitress or waiter.
[1:11:06] People that are serving you.
[1:11:11] I I get shocked sometimes sitting around
[1:11:14] a table with folks wherever I am with
[1:11:18] believers though in the course of being
[1:11:20] served how few thank yous I hear or how
[1:11:25] few hey I really appreciate that hope
[1:11:27] you're having a nice day is everything
[1:11:30] going
[1:11:31] good it shocks
[1:11:35] me we come in with negative attitude
[1:11:38] right off the bat I can't believe my
[1:11:39] waitress has a nose ring and tattoos.
[1:11:42] Well, I can't believe how rude you are
[1:11:44] to her.
[1:11:49] I'm sorry they don't know Jesus.
[1:11:52] And it's it's really sorry to say that
[1:11:54] they don't know him anymore after having
[1:11:56] served you.
[1:11:59] Because of your attitude towards them,
[1:12:00] your judgment, I can't even enjoy my
[1:12:02] food. You ain't licking her nose. Why
[1:12:04] can't you enjoy your food?
[1:12:08] But we get this attitude. She's worldly.
[1:12:11] Okay. So was I.
[1:12:14] So are you. If not for the grace of God.
[1:12:17] There you are with the nose ring and
[1:12:19] earrings and tattoos. I'm not judging
[1:12:21] them. I'm saying, God, let my life show
[1:12:23] love and compassion and kindness and
[1:12:27] goodness.
[1:12:30] Yes, sir.
[1:12:33] I didn't get good service. I'm not going
[1:12:34] to leave a good tip.
[1:12:38] You know, it was often told that the
[1:12:39] worse the waitress was, the bigger
[1:12:41] brother Brandham would tip them
[1:12:46] because he says they need it. You don't
[1:12:48] know what she went through today.
[1:12:55] Just rubber meets the road stuff. How
[1:12:58] you living?
[1:13:00] Not what are you professing? Not what
[1:13:02] doctrines do you know?
[1:13:05] How you living?
[1:13:10] I'm not talking about when things go
[1:13:11] good.
[1:13:13] What
[1:13:14] separates that waitress's
[1:13:17] experience between you and the regular
[1:13:21] other fella good old boy from
[1:13:24] Menon when things are at their
[1:13:26] absolute
[1:13:28] worst orders messed up food's burnt
[1:13:31] didn't get a refill the whole time I was
[1:13:35] there I'm not I'm not believing this is
[1:13:39] an opportunity
[1:13:42] this is your opportunity to show that
[1:13:45] person how Christians act, not how
[1:13:49] people with temper issues act or
[1:13:51] attitude issue acts. What is projected
[1:13:55] to them in their lowest moment on their
[1:13:58] worst day or should I say on your worst
[1:14:01] day you've already had a bad day and you
[1:14:03] walk in and you get a grilled chicken
[1:14:05] sandwich. Look at me. I don't eat
[1:14:07] grilled chicken.
[1:14:10] I ordered a fried chicken sandwich and
[1:14:12] you brought me unsweet tea and now I'm
[1:14:14] having to wait for you to fix it. Now
[1:14:15] I'm late to get to my appointment and
[1:14:17] now you think I'm
[1:14:21] You've never had an off day.
[1:14:23] You've never had a bad
[1:14:25] day. Because what we have to remember is
[1:14:28] behind that skin is a human being with a
[1:14:31] soul and a desire to be loved.
[1:14:36] How will they know? Who's going to show
[1:14:38] them? Who's going to demonstrate it?
[1:14:42] Because the love of God will make you
[1:14:44] treat people right. Not how you think
[1:14:47] they deserve to be treated.
[1:14:50] Right. Right is right no matter what the
[1:14:53] situation.
[1:14:56] Well, I'm going to treat them fair. No.
[1:14:58] Treat them right.
[1:15:00] What if Well, they don't deserve it.
[1:15:02] Well, what if you got what you deserved?
[1:15:04] What if I got what I deserve? What if
[1:15:07] God had said, "You know what? I'll treat
[1:15:08] you fairly. I don't want his fairness.
[1:15:13] I want his grace. I want his mercy. I
[1:15:17] want his love." Amen. There's a there's
[1:15:20] a soul there. There's a person there.
[1:15:22] Brother Brandham talks about the maniac
[1:15:24] in pla on the platform in Oregon. He
[1:15:26] says that man when he come to me instead
[1:15:28] of him spitting in my face, calling me a
[1:15:30] snake in the grass before nearly 10,000
[1:15:33] people, well, it wasn't that. It wasn't
[1:15:35] the man.
[1:15:37] He's a man that eats, drinks, sleeps
[1:15:40] perhaps with a family and loves and and
[1:15:42] just like I am or you are. See, and you
[1:15:46] never cast a devil out by the wrong
[1:15:49] attitude. It takes love to do that. And
[1:15:52] love is the most powerful force that
[1:15:54] there is in the world. Now, if you
[1:15:56] notice, a devil is always hate.
[1:16:00] Look at this. This This really blew me
[1:16:02] away.
[1:16:04] And when people hate someone,
[1:16:07] remember it's a terrible devil to
[1:16:12] despise or
[1:16:17] dislike. You mustn't do
[1:16:23] that. Learn this. Learn this that as you
[1:16:27] do to others, you do to Christ.
[1:16:31] When you be good to somebody else,
[1:16:33] you're being good to Christ. If you
[1:16:36] mistreat somebody else, you're
[1:16:38] mistreating Christ.
[1:16:40] And I said exactly what he did. Oh my.
[1:16:46] Oh
[1:16:47] my. Because listen, we live in a world
[1:16:50] full of of hate, a world full of
[1:16:52] division. It's attacking homes. It's
[1:16:55] attacking families. It's attacking
[1:16:57] churches. And we're called to stand
[1:16:58] against it. We're called to be a shining
[1:17:01] light and called to speak peace, to
[1:17:03] reject division and divisive speech and
[1:17:06] and project the love that has been
[1:17:08] projected to us onto others. Amen. So
[1:17:11] that they may know the kindness of God.
[1:17:14] And listen, I don't I can't stop there.
[1:17:16] We can't just talk about how we treat
[1:17:18] people out there.
[1:17:20] We can't just talk about that because a
[1:17:22] lot of times we'll have a lot of grace
[1:17:24] for those people out there and none for
[1:17:26] the people we go to church with.
[1:17:30] I repented, Brother Joe. I repented.
[1:17:34] Yeah. I told you in the back office I
[1:17:36] had to. Oh, good.
[1:17:39] Yeah. Because I was getting frustrated
[1:17:41] at a situation. I said, "Man, I'm fing
[1:17:43] to go out there and preach about having
[1:17:44] grace for people. I need to have grace
[1:17:46] for this situation."
[1:17:50] We have grace for so many people except
[1:17:53] for our brothers and sisters.
[1:17:55] We can't allow ourselves to lose
[1:17:58] brotherly love.
[1:18:00] Listen, we have a wonderful church. We
[1:18:02] have a wonderful message community
[1:18:04] around the world. How the devil would
[1:18:06] love to get in that and begin to tear
[1:18:09] this family at this one and this person
[1:18:10] at that one and get these feelings hurt
[1:18:12] and let this thing fester and then you
[1:18:15] got sides and then you got division.
[1:18:19] What's Hebrews 13:1 tell us? Let
[1:18:22] brotherly love continue. Such a short
[1:18:26] and simple verse. And and it's not just
[1:18:29] talking about the love that we have for
[1:18:30] mankind. It's not even talking about the
[1:18:33] love that we have for people you uh your
[1:18:35] siblings that you share a common parent
[1:18:37] with. But it's the special and spiritual
[1:18:39] affection that we should have for the
[1:18:41] children of God, our brothers and our
[1:18:44] sisters in Christ.
[1:18:47] And how we treat one another matters.
[1:18:52] He says, "That's exactly right. Cuz I
[1:18:54] realize as I treat the people, I'm
[1:18:56] treating God.
[1:18:58] Just my attitude towards you is my
[1:19:00] attitude towards Christ. And your
[1:19:03] attitudes towards me is the same thing."
[1:19:05] That's right. Towards Christ. The way I
[1:19:08] treat you, that's my attitude towards
[1:19:12] God. It matters how we treat one
[1:19:14] another. It matters that we're kind and
[1:19:17] we're
[1:19:18] loving. Scripture says, "A new
[1:19:21] commandment I give unto you, that you
[1:19:22] love one another as I have loved you,
[1:19:24] that ye also love one another. By
[1:19:28] this, by the miracles and and by the
[1:19:30] depth and by the mysteries, and by this
[1:19:34] shall all men know that you are my
[1:19:36] disciples." If you have love one to
[1:19:40] another, Romans 12:10, "Be kindly,
[1:19:43] affection one to another with brotherly
[1:19:45] love, in honor, preferring one another."
[1:19:48] Ephesians 4:32, "And be ye kind one to
[1:19:50] another, tender-hearted, forgiving one
[1:19:53] another, even as God for Christ's sake
[1:19:56] hath forgiven you." I love that it says
[1:19:58] that, forgiving one another, because it
[1:20:00] lets you know there are going to be
[1:20:01] times you get done wrong.
[1:20:05] It's letting you know there's going to
[1:20:07] be times that this one's going to cross
[1:20:08] this one.
[1:20:11] And it says, "Forgive them the same way
[1:20:14] that Christ has forgiven you." Why over
[1:20:17] and over again is the scripture teaching
[1:20:21] on this? Because it's important. It's
[1:20:24] not simple. It's important. And because
[1:20:26] the enemy is going to try to steal it
[1:20:28] from you. Brother Brandham taught us
[1:20:29] that the very first thing that the
[1:20:31] Palmer worm did said he'd come around,
[1:20:32] take off the fruits. I have two pages of
[1:20:34] fruits. I just want to read something.
[1:20:36] That first thing, the first fruit he
[1:20:38] took off was brotherly love. That's
[1:20:41] right. That's one of the things that
[1:20:43] kills the church right there. I say
[1:20:47] don't let it happen here. Don't let it
[1:20:49] kill the church here. When division
[1:20:51] comes up, squash that thing. When a
[1:20:53] little funny feeling comes up towards
[1:20:54] somebody, let that thing go. Let
[1:20:56] forgiveness free. Let it flow out of
[1:20:58] your life and don't let it come in and
[1:21:00] kill the church.
[1:21:03] He says it again. That's where the
[1:21:04] church is. That's what's the matter.
[1:21:06] They've lost their brotherly love.
[1:21:08] They've lost feeling one for another. We
[1:21:11] need a love for one another. And love
[1:21:13] will contact when nothing else will do
[1:21:15] it. You see somebody hurting, you see
[1:21:18] somebody struggling, you see somebody
[1:21:20] going through trial after trial, they
[1:21:22] don't need you to say, "Pull yourself up
[1:21:24] by the bootstraps. Get over yourself."
[1:21:26] No. Love will contact when nothing else
[1:21:29] will do it. I'm here for you, brother.
[1:21:31] I'm praying for you, sister. Is there
[1:21:34] anything I can do for you? I just want
[1:21:36] you to know that I care.
[1:21:40] Listen, that's what we're talking about.
[1:21:41] This ain't some kind of of of sermon
[1:21:44] while I'm telling you now. Make sure
[1:21:45] that everybody goes to everybody's house
[1:21:47] and everybody's invited to everybody's
[1:21:48] birthday.
[1:21:50] We're not in elementary school. We don't
[1:21:52] get our feelings hurt anymore by not
[1:21:53] getting invited to a birthday.
[1:21:57] Grow up.
[1:21:59] Sorry. I hope that's not something that
[1:22:01] happened recently. I'll be feeling real
[1:22:03] bad. I'm just
[1:22:05] talking. What I'm saying is this is how
[1:22:07] we treat one another.
[1:22:10] how we speak to one another with a kind
[1:22:12] word, with softness, with care,
[1:22:16] understanding that our words carry a
[1:22:19] greater impact than what we may ever
[1:22:20] understand.
[1:22:23] Colossians
[1:22:24] 3:12, put on therefore as the elect of
[1:22:27] God, that's you, holy and beloved,
[1:22:30] bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness
[1:22:32] of mind, meekness,
[1:22:34] longsuffering, forbearing one another,
[1:22:37] and forgiving one another. If any man
[1:22:39] have a quarrel against
[1:22:41] any, even as Christ forgave you, so also
[1:22:45] do ye. Listen, by nature, we're all
[1:22:50] extremely different. And so these things
[1:22:52] naturally come easier for some than it
[1:22:56] does others. We know, you know, some
[1:22:58] people struggle to forgive. It's their
[1:23:00] battle. Some people let things go and
[1:23:02] forgive like that. Some struggle to be
[1:23:05] friendly. For some, it just flows out of
[1:23:07] them. They love everybody and they're
[1:23:09] kind to everybody and they're friendly
[1:23:10] to everybody. For others, it's a work in
[1:23:13] progress.
[1:23:15] Well, that's just not my nature. Then
[1:23:18] make yourself do it.
[1:23:23] I'll put it in the words of my
[1:23:25] generation. Fake it till you make it.
[1:23:29] Well, that's not genuine. Doesn't
[1:23:31] matter.
[1:23:33] Brother Brandham actually says to do
[1:23:35] this. Watch. Even in everything, it will
[1:23:39] grow on you. Try to be good to one
[1:23:42] another. Try to shake hands and be
[1:23:46] friendly and nice. He's making it very
[1:23:48] clear that this may not be coming
[1:23:49] natural, but you got to try.
[1:23:53] Tear down all the walls of partition
[1:23:55] around you. That's malice, indifferent,
[1:23:57] ungodly. Tear it down. Keep doing good
[1:23:59] to one another. Every time you meet one
[1:24:02] another, make yourself
[1:24:06] Come on. Be good to one another.
[1:24:12] And the first thing you know, it'll grow
[1:24:15] around you.
[1:24:17] It'll grow around you till a bundle of
[1:24:19] love will wrap you up. Hallelujah.
[1:24:22] That's the marking of God. I say I want
[1:24:26] the marking of God, Lord. If I got to
[1:24:28] try and try and try again, if I got to
[1:24:31] make myself time after time, your
[1:24:33] prophecy said it's going to eventually
[1:24:34] grow on me and eventually I'll be
[1:24:36] surrounded with a bundle of love and
[1:24:38] that is the marking of God. Let Evening
[1:24:40] Light Tabernacle be marked by God. Let
[1:24:43] Eden Light Tabernacle be marked with the
[1:24:45] love of God. Let it project out of our
[1:24:47] lives, project out of our homes, project
[1:24:50] out of our church. There is a God. There
[1:24:53] is forgiveness. There is grace. There is
[1:24:55] mercy. Not you better. you better. No,
[1:24:58] I'm saying come and drink of the waters
[1:25:00] of life freely. There's love here.
[1:25:02] There's mercy. There's salvation for you
[1:25:05] here. Hallelujah.
[1:25:08] Look, we want the miracles. We want our
[1:25:10] enemies destroyed. We want salvation. We
[1:25:13] want the moving of the spirit. We want
[1:25:14] our children restored. And yet, none of
[1:25:16] that can happen when we're torn apart
[1:25:18] and bitter. None of that can happen when
[1:25:21] the atmosphere is all tore up because of
[1:25:23] grudges and and things like that and
[1:25:25] holding grudges and speaking division.
[1:25:28] We want God to feel free to come into
[1:25:30] our home and into our
[1:25:32] church. And if he's going to do that, we
[1:25:35] have to operate the God the way God told
[1:25:36] us to operate.
[1:25:38] He says, "Now, if you want God to hear
[1:25:40] your prayer, send an angel to your home,
[1:25:43] live right, do right, treat everybody
[1:25:46] right, be right before God, and God will
[1:25:50] grant that to you, church. I want God to
[1:25:54] move tonight. I want him to feel freedom
[1:25:57] move in my life and my home tonight. So,
[1:25:59] I want to get everything I can out of
[1:26:01] the way tonight. I want to give
[1:26:02] forgiveness tonight. I I want to let go
[1:26:04] of grudges tonight. I want to let go of
[1:26:06] complexes tonight. I want to make all
[1:26:08] wrongs right tonight. I want to let all
[1:26:11] my bitterness go tonight that God can
[1:26:13] feel free to come in and answer prayers
[1:26:15] and restore children and heal bodies and
[1:26:18] deliver the bound. I want the love of
[1:26:20] God projecting in this place.
[1:26:22] Hallelujah. So God can move. So God can
[1:26:27] answer. No matter what the obstacle is
[1:26:29] tonight, God, I just want to let it go.
[1:26:31] I want to let love take over and let it
[1:26:34] go. I want to let love take over and
[1:26:37] give that forgiveness.
[1:26:40] They don't deserve it, brother Aaron.
[1:26:41] God did it for you when you didn't
[1:26:43] deserve it. God did it for me when I
[1:26:46] didn't deserve it. He did it for me when
[1:26:48] I was his enemy. Let us as his people
[1:26:52] make it a point to project it to others.
[1:26:58] It was Christ and David.
[1:27:02] He says, "Is there anyone I can show the
[1:27:04] kindness of God
[1:27:07] to?" And the king said, "Is there not
[1:27:10] yet any of the house of Saul that I may
[1:27:12] show the kindness of God unto him?" And
[1:27:15] Zeas said unto the king, Jonathan hath
[1:27:17] yet a son which is lame on his feet. And
[1:27:20] the king said unto him, "Where is he?"
[1:27:22] Zebas said unto the king, "Behold, he is
[1:27:23] in the house of Maker, the son of Amile
[1:27:26] in Loabar." Then King David sent and
[1:27:29] fetched him out of the house of Macker,
[1:27:31] the son of
[1:27:32] Amile from
[1:27:33] Loabar. Now I want to look for just a
[1:27:36] second at Jonathan's son that they're
[1:27:39] referencing. His name
[1:27:41] is
[1:27:43] Mphibicheth. I've looked at that all
[1:27:45] week and I still have to look at it
[1:27:46] before I say it every time.
[1:27:49] Mphibicheth. Second Samuel 4:4. This is
[1:27:52] his story.
[1:27:54] And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that
[1:27:58] was lame of his feet. He was five years
[1:28:01] old when the tidings came of Saul and
[1:28:04] Jonathan out of Jezrael. In other words,
[1:28:06] they've been killed. Your daddy's been
[1:28:09] killed. Your grandpa's been killed. And
[1:28:12] his nurse took him up and fled. And it
[1:28:14] came to pass as she made haste to flee
[1:28:16] that he fell and became lame. We don't
[1:28:18] know how far he fell, what the situation
[1:28:20] was, whether it was over a banister,
[1:28:22] what, but he couldn't walk again.
[1:28:24] He became lame and his name was
[1:28:28] Mphibicheth. His nurse ran. Why? She was
[1:28:31] scared that the Philistines would come
[1:28:33] to Saul's house and wipe out the rest of
[1:28:35] his lineage. This was one that was in
[1:28:38] line for the throne.
[1:28:40] Mphibicheth. And she got scared and she
[1:28:42] began to run trying to hide him and and
[1:28:44] get him to safety. Scared that
[1:28:46] Mphibbeeth would would be their target
[1:28:48] as an heir to the throne. And in the
[1:28:50] chaos that Mphibicheth has nothing to do
[1:28:53] with, he is
[1:28:56] hurt. Think about it. Why is he wounded?
[1:28:58] Why is he crippled? Why is he at this
[1:29:00] point in hiding? Nobody even know he's
[1:29:03] he exists until David asked
[1:29:05] why. You can trace it back to
[1:29:08] grandpa. Because Saul got lifted up.
[1:29:11] Because Saul disobeyed God. Because Saul
[1:29:14] led Israel into a defeat. The Lord had
[1:29:17] departed from Saul. And the scripture
[1:29:19] says that the the Lord had become his
[1:29:21] enemy. And because of his disobedience,
[1:29:23] the the kingdom was torn from his hands
[1:29:25] and it was given over to David. And
[1:29:27] because of his actions, Israel would
[1:29:29] fall into the hands of the Philistines.
[1:29:31] This was all Saul's
[1:29:34] fault. He was in rebellion. He had
[1:29:37] rulership taken away. He leads his
[1:29:39] family into death. Look at it. None of
[1:29:43] this is Mphibicheth's
[1:29:46] fault. None of it.
[1:29:50] Sometimes it's
[1:29:53] true that our hurts are not our
[1:29:57] fault. Sometimes it's
[1:30:00] true that it's others that have wounded
[1:30:02] us. That it's the actions of others that
[1:30:05] have has hurt us. We we hurt by family.
[1:30:08] Sometimes we're hurt by church. Church
[1:30:11] splits and family splits that we have
[1:30:13] nothing to do with can leave us crippled
[1:30:16] and marred.
[1:30:18] our faith torn down. Cycles passed down
[1:30:21] from grandparents, then down from dad.
[1:30:25] Choices that mom and dad made when we
[1:30:27] were nothing but
[1:30:28] children. Don't ever lose sight of how
[1:30:31] much your actions affect
[1:30:33] others, especially those in your home,
[1:30:36] but
[1:30:38] others. How much your words affect
[1:30:40] others. And it may not manifest that day
[1:30:42] or that week. It may not manifest for
[1:30:44] years to come. But your attitudes and
[1:30:47] your words and your actions can haunt
[1:30:49] your family for generations.
[1:30:52] But that's not the end of the story.
[1:30:54] Your attitudes and your words and your
[1:30:56] actions can also be the source of
[1:30:58] encouragement and a testimony of how we
[1:31:00] overcome. That's the flip side of that
[1:31:03] coin. I say tonight, it's time to break
[1:31:04] those cycles. It's time to rise above
[1:31:07] besetting sins. It's time to get up out
[1:31:09] of your fa failures tonight as a leader
[1:31:11] of your home and say, "This is not who I
[1:31:14] am. I am a child of God. I I'm called to
[1:31:16] overcome. I'm laying down hatred. I'm
[1:31:19] laying down bitterness. I'm laying down
[1:31:21] complexes. Listen, some of you don't
[1:31:23] know what it would do for your home, for
[1:31:25] your children one time. To see daddy
[1:31:27] win.
[1:31:30] To see daddy rise above the thing that
[1:31:32] he always falls down to. To see daddy
[1:31:34] not lose his temper in a moment where he
[1:31:36] normally would. To see daddy take the
[1:31:39] family to prayer. You don't know what it
[1:31:41] would do for your home. to see mama rise
[1:31:43] above those things that has held her
[1:31:44] down time after time after time and
[1:31:47] begin to say, "This is how we overcome.
[1:31:49] This is how we fight our battles. This
[1:31:51] is how we say I was wrong. This is how
[1:31:54] we forgive. This is how we move beyond
[1:31:57] hurts and scars. You can do that for
[1:32:00] your home."
[1:32:05] Mphibicheth because of family choices,
[1:32:08] because of what granddad had did, all
[1:32:10] was lost. His inheritance was gone. His
[1:32:13] life was ruined. He lived in obscurity
[1:32:16] among his mother's people in Gilead on
[1:32:18] the other side of
[1:32:19] Jordan, seemingly
[1:32:25] forgotten. But there had been an
[1:32:28] oath. Oh, thank you, Jesus. there had
[1:32:31] been a promise. I'm so glad there was an
[1:32:33] oath. I'm so glad that there was a
[1:32:35] promise. Hallelujah. And David in the
[1:32:38] midst of all that, he remembers the
[1:32:40] oath. He remembers the promise. If
[1:32:42] you'll go back to 1st Samuel 20:14, it
[1:32:45] says, "And thou shalt not only while,"
[1:32:47] this is Jonathan speaking. "While yet I
[1:32:49] live, show me the kindness of the Lord
[1:32:51] that I die not, but also that thou shalt
[1:32:54] not cut off thy kindness from my house
[1:32:56] forever."
[1:32:58] No, not when the Lord hath cut off the
[1:33:00] enemies of David, everyone from the face
[1:33:02] of the earth. And then it goes on in
[1:33:04] verse 42 to say, "And Jonathan said to
[1:33:06] David, go in peace, for as much as we
[1:33:09] have sworn both of us in the name of the
[1:33:12] Lord, saying, 'The Lord be between me
[1:33:13] and thee, and between my seed and thy
[1:33:16] seed forever." And he arose and
[1:33:19] departed, and Jonathan went into the
[1:33:22] city. Think about what this was. It was
[1:33:24] a vow made before Mphibicheth was ever
[1:33:27] born.
[1:33:29] There was a promise given and the
[1:33:31] promise said that it was not only to you
[1:33:33] but to your children and to your
[1:33:35] children's children and to them that are
[1:33:37] far off. It's not just for you, but this
[1:33:40] is for your seed also. It's an oath.
[1:33:43] It's a promise. I'll be there for them.
[1:33:46] I'll take care of them. I'll fill them
[1:33:48] with the Holy Ghost. I'll save them.
[1:33:50] I'll save them when they don't want
[1:33:51] saving. When they're lost. with her
[1:33:53] hiding. There was an oath given.
[1:33:57] Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. A promise.
[1:34:00] Adam may have fell. He may have lost the
[1:34:03] kingdom. God said, "My creation may be
[1:34:05] marred, but I'm not going to let it all
[1:34:08] ruin. I'm not going to let you be lost."
[1:34:11] Hallelujah. Adam was on a do this, do
[1:34:13] that covenant. But when God started
[1:34:16] over, he started with Abraham. And it
[1:34:18] wasn't you do and I'll do. It was I've
[1:34:20] already done it. I've already blessed
[1:34:23] your seed. Your seed shall inherit the
[1:34:25] gates of the enemy. Your seed shall
[1:34:27] overcome. Hallelujah.
[1:34:29] Glory to God. It's a covenant that still
[1:34:32] stands today. I don't care about what
[1:34:35] grandpa did. I don't care about your
[1:34:37] failures. I don't care how long you've
[1:34:39] been in hiding. He swore an oath. Oh,
[1:34:42] blessed be the name of the Lord. You're
[1:34:45] not forgotten today. You're not
[1:34:47] forgotten. No matter how long it's been,
[1:34:50] how far back you've been hiding, how
[1:34:52] crippled you've been, he said, "I will
[1:34:55] restore. There will be a body change.
[1:34:57] There will be a rapture." Oh,
[1:34:59] hallelujah. The love of God been an oath
[1:35:02] projected to a people. David remembered
[1:35:06] and he sent for
[1:35:08] Mphibicheth. Think about it. What fear
[1:35:11] it must have put in Mafibasheth at first
[1:35:14] to see the royal
[1:35:16] coach, royal chariot ride up. Think
[1:35:20] about what was going through his head.
[1:35:22] David's
[1:35:23] men. David's men. What's going on? My
[1:35:26] family's enemy to David. My family is
[1:35:29] rivals to David.
[1:35:32] Surely I must die. He's standing where
[1:35:35] Adam stood.
[1:35:38] Surely I'm going to
[1:35:41] die. I've become enemy to
[1:35:44] God. David's men show up. He's thinking,
[1:35:48] "I'm an enemy to the king." Oh, I love
[1:35:51] the things you find in scripture that
[1:35:52] just strike you. Mphibicheth never went
[1:35:55] looking for the king.
[1:35:58] The king said, "Isn't there some seed
[1:36:00] out there somewhere? Isn't there
[1:36:02] somebody somewhere out there that I can
[1:36:04] show my grace to and my mercy to? I'm
[1:36:06] going to shed my blood for them. I'm
[1:36:08] going to chase after them. I'm going to
[1:36:10] find them. No matter what condition
[1:36:11] they're in, no matter how scarred up, no
[1:36:13] matter how hurt, no matter how torn
[1:36:15] down. The king came looking for you. Oh,
[1:36:18] because he swore an oath to you. The
[1:36:21] king came looking. We were in the same
[1:36:24] spot as Mphibicheth. We were marred. We
[1:36:26] were born in sin. No victory. We were in
[1:36:29] hiding. Doesn't anyone care? Is there
[1:36:33] any hope for man? Our dominion was gone
[1:36:37] because our parents, Adam and Eve, had
[1:36:39] disobeyed and had sold us into sin. But
[1:36:42] then the king came looking for us.
[1:36:44] Hallelujah. There was an oath to be
[1:36:46] kept. There was a redeemer promised.
[1:36:49] Even though we was enemies to God.
[1:36:51] What's the scripture say? But God
[1:36:53] commanded his love towards us. In that
[1:36:55] while we were yet sinners, Christ died
[1:36:57] for us. Much more than being now
[1:37:00] justified by his blood, we shall be
[1:37:02] saved from wrath through him. For if
[1:37:04] when we were enemies, we were reconciled
[1:37:08] to God by the death of his son, much
[1:37:10] more being reconciled, we shall be saved
[1:37:12] by his life, and not only so, but we
[1:37:14] also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
[1:37:17] Christ, by whom we have now received the
[1:37:20] atonement. That's the condition we were
[1:37:22] in. We were yet enemies when the king
[1:37:24] came looking. He says, "Our kind, loving
[1:37:27] heavenly father, we approach thee
[1:37:28] tonight in the lovely name of thy son
[1:37:30] Jesus Christ. We love him because he
[1:37:32] first loved us and gave his life for us.
[1:37:35] And we who were once alienated from God,
[1:37:37] cut off without mercy, without hope in
[1:37:39] the world, sinners by nature, dying in
[1:37:42] disgrace, going to a devil's hell,
[1:37:44] endless eternity. While we were in this
[1:37:46] condition, enemies of God. God sent his
[1:37:51] own son. And now we are sons and
[1:37:55] daughters of God by his grace. Amen.
[1:38:00] And Mphibicheth must have thought,
[1:38:02] "Surely I'm going to
[1:38:04] die." And they bring him into David's
[1:38:07] presence. And David said unto him, "Fear
[1:38:11] not." What lovely
[1:38:14] words. Fear not, for I will surely show
[1:38:19] thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's
[1:38:21] sake. And I will restore thee all the
[1:38:24] land of Saul thy father. and thou shalt
[1:38:27] eat bread at my table
[1:38:30] continually. And he bowed himself and
[1:38:32] said, What is thy servant that thou
[1:38:34] shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I
[1:38:36] am? Then the king called to Zeba, Saul's
[1:38:38] servant, said unto him, I have given
[1:38:40] unto thy master son all that pertain to
[1:38:42] Saul and to all his house. Thou
[1:38:44] therefore, and thy sons, and thy servant
[1:38:46] shalt till the land for him, and thou
[1:38:49] shalt bring in the fruits that thy
[1:38:50] master son may have food to eat. But
[1:38:52] Mphibicheth, thy master's son, shall eat
[1:38:55] bread always at my table. Now Zeba had
[1:38:59] 15 sons and 20
[1:39:03] servants. Then said Zeba unto the king,
[1:39:05] according to all thy lord, the king hath
[1:39:07] commanded his servant, so shall thy
[1:39:08] servant do. As for Mphibicheth, said the
[1:39:10] king, he shall eat at my table as one of
[1:39:14] the king's sons. And Mphibicheth had a
[1:39:17] young son whose name was Micah. And all
[1:39:19] that dwelt in the house of Zeba were
[1:39:20] servants unto Mphibicheth. So
[1:39:23] Mphibicheth dwelt in Jerusalem, for he
[1:39:25] did eat
[1:39:26] continually at the king's table and was
[1:39:29] lame on both of his feet. Look at this.
[1:39:33] He didn't bring Mphibicheth in and begin
[1:39:35] to attack him. He didn't say, "Why
[1:39:37] you've been hiding all these years? Look
[1:39:39] at you all scarred up. You're unworthy.
[1:39:42] Look at his feet. Look at his failures."
[1:39:45] Oh, but Mphibicheth was carried to the
[1:39:47] king's table.
[1:39:48] He was carried to the table and he was
[1:39:50] given a place. Listen, the king didn't
[1:39:53] come looking to punish you. He's not
[1:39:55] calling you tonight to punish you. He's
[1:39:58] calling you tonight to restore you. He's
[1:40:01] calling you tonight to give back
[1:40:02] everything that your granddaddy lost.
[1:40:05] Everything that Adam lost in the fall.
[1:40:07] He said, "I'm going to Calvary so I can
[1:40:09] give it back to you tonight. It's
[1:40:11] yours." Once again, think about it. This
[1:40:14] was his kingdom. This was his kingdom.
[1:40:17] And he said, "I'm going to give you
[1:40:19] everything you would have inherited had
[1:40:21] Saul not fallen." He says, "Had Adam not
[1:40:24] fallen, you would have had this. So, I'm
[1:40:26] going to go to Calvary and I'm going to
[1:40:28] restore to you." Listen, you don't got
[1:40:30] to eat crumbs in the street. You don't
[1:40:32] got to beg. You don't got to borrow. He
[1:40:34] said, "I'm carrying you to the king's
[1:40:36] table where you can eat the good things
[1:40:38] of God." How much? Continually, day
[1:40:42] after day after day, you've been given a
[1:40:45] spot at the king's table. Hallelujah.
[1:40:49] You have dominion now. You have victory
[1:40:52] now. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:40:55] Oh, Lord Jesus. Man was convicted of
[1:40:59] rebellion against God. And like Saul's
[1:41:02] house was under a sentence of rejection.
[1:41:06] We were brought low, impoverished, lame,
[1:41:10] and crippled. And the king came looking.
[1:41:14] He came and carry you to the table.
[1:41:17] Hallelujah. So you can have a feast
[1:41:19] every day in his
[1:41:21] presence. And once again in this
[1:41:24] day, in the day that we're living in,
[1:41:27] the church had become marred and scarred
[1:41:30] and hardly
[1:41:31] recognizable. So far fallen from that
[1:41:34] original that had feasted on the fresh
[1:41:36] mana there at
[1:41:38] Pentecost, eating crumbs and barely
[1:41:40] getting by. The church had been stripped
[1:41:43] down through the ages of its love, of
[1:41:45] its joy, of its
[1:41:46] truth. And he came again in this day and
[1:41:49] he said, "Is there any of Adam's
[1:41:52] race? Is there any that I might show the
[1:41:55] kindness of God to?
[1:41:57] Is there any that I can show his love
[1:42:00] to? I made a covenant. I made a promise
[1:42:04] of restoration and I have not
[1:42:07] forgotten. But I have come down. I'm
[1:42:11] going to send a message that they might
[1:42:12] know the love of God. Church, he came
[1:42:15] looking for us. He sent a message to
[1:42:18] find us. He brought us into his presence
[1:42:20] to restore us. What is this message?
[1:42:23] It's his goodness. It's his mercy. It's
[1:42:25] his love projected to us in this day.
[1:42:28] Oh, hallelujah. Is there any of Adam's
[1:42:31] race? Is there any Abraham's seed that
[1:42:33] says, "Lord, I want to come to your
[1:42:35] table tonight. I want to come to your
[1:42:37] table." And he sends a message in this
[1:42:40] day. And that message isn't isn't to
[1:42:42] condemn us. He didn't come looking to
[1:42:44] judge you. But it was a message that
[1:42:46] picked you up. And it's going to carry
[1:42:48] you to the table that's a thousand miles
[1:42:50] long. And you're going to be able to eat
[1:42:52] at that table for the rest of your life
[1:42:54] at the king's table in eternity forever
[1:42:57] and ever and ever. Why? Because he said,
[1:43:00] "I love them. I'm going to love them
[1:43:03] through it all. I'm going to love them
[1:43:05] through their rebellion. I'm going to
[1:43:07] send a message to turn their hearts once
[1:43:09] more to the faith of the fathers. And he
[1:43:12] came seeking why? That they may know the
[1:43:17] love of God. Will you stand to your feet
[1:43:19] with me this evening? Hallelujah.
[1:43:22] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:43:25] Church, we've been carried to the table
[1:43:28] and placed not as beggars.
[1:43:31] Not as beggars, he said, but as a
[1:43:35] child of the king.
[1:43:38] Everything that Adam lost in his
[1:43:41] rebellion, God said, I'm giving it back
[1:43:44] to you. I'm restoring it all.
[1:43:47] Hallelujah. We didn't deserve it. We
[1:43:50] couldn't earn it. Nothing we could do.
[1:43:54] But he said, "Is there seed of Adam
[1:43:59] that I can show my love to?" Oh, I love
[1:44:02] seeing that projected through David's
[1:44:03] life. Him going after his greatest enemy
[1:44:06] and giving him all that back. Even
[1:44:09] though Saul, it said, was an enemy to
[1:44:12] God, the Bible comes right over in the
[1:44:14] New Testament says you were enemies to
[1:44:16] God.
[1:44:18] And yet, while in that
[1:44:19] condition, lost without hope, nowhere to
[1:44:23] turn, nowhere to go, defeated, hiding in
[1:44:26] some backwoods land, crippled, beat
[1:44:30] up. If you put that back up for me, I
[1:44:33] just love this
[1:44:35] picture. They carry him into David's
[1:44:39] home and he can't
[1:44:42] walk. So, David gets down to where he
[1:44:44] is.
[1:44:47] What is this? This isn't just you're an
[1:44:50] enemy that I
[1:44:52] forgive. This isn't just I'm doing
[1:44:56] this to make my name look better. This
[1:44:58] is him embracing him as a son. This is
[1:45:03] royalty stooping down to where
[1:45:06] Mphibicheth
[1:45:07] was. That was
[1:45:09] me. I couldn't get no higher than that.
[1:45:12] I couldn't go no further than that.
[1:45:16] I'd crippled my own life. I'd done so
[1:45:18] many awful things. I'd ruined myself.
[1:45:21] I'd given it all away. I'd become
[1:45:22] enemies with God. He said, "That's okay.
[1:45:25] I'll come to you.
[1:45:27] I'll come to you and embrace you there.
[1:45:30] And from there, I'll pick you up.
[1:45:33] I'll pick you up out of the monk. I'll
[1:45:35] pick you up out of the mire. I'll take
[1:45:37] you from that diet of the pig pin you've
[1:45:39] been eating and I'll bring you to the
[1:45:40] king's table. I'll bring you to
[1:45:42] victory."
[1:45:44] That's true love right there.
[1:45:46] That's true love right there. Humbling
[1:45:49] yourself to show others the love of God.
[1:45:53] Church, let that love project out of our
[1:45:55] life. We love you with the love of the
[1:45:58] Lord. May God bless you tonight as we
[1:46:00] worship together.
[1:46:08] Forsen. I was shattered by the
[1:46:13] fall. Broken and
[1:46:16] forgotten. Feeling lost and all
[1:46:21] alone. Summoned by the
[1:46:24] king into the master's court.
[1:46:30] Lifted by the
[1:46:33] Savior and cradled in his arms. Thank
[1:46:37] you, Lord. I was carry to the
[1:46:45] table. Seated where I don't
[1:46:53] belong. I was carried to the table.
[1:47:02] swept away by his
[1:47:11] love. And I don't see my brokenness
[1:47:19] anymore. When I'm seated at the table of
[1:47:24] the
[1:47:25] Lord, I was carried to the
[1:47:28] [Music]
[1:47:33] table. The table of the
[1:47:40] Lord. Fighting thoughts of fear and
[1:47:43] wondering why he called my name.
[1:47:48] Am I good enough to share this cup? This
[1:47:52] world has left me
[1:47:55] lame. Even in my
[1:47:59] weakness, the Savior called my
[1:48:03] name. In his holy
[1:48:07] presence, I'm healed and
[1:48:13] unashamed. As I'm carried to the
[1:48:20] table, seated where I don't
[1:48:28] belong. I was carried to the
[1:48:36] table, swept away by his love.
[1:48:47] And I don't see my brokenness
[1:48:53] anymore when I'm seated at the table of
[1:48:58] the
[1:49:00] Lord. I am caring to the
[1:49:07] table. the table
[1:49:10] of the
[1:49:12] [Music]
[1:49:14] Lord. Fighting thoughts of fear and
[1:49:18] wondering why he called my
[1:49:21] name. Am I good enough to share this
[1:49:25] cup? This world has left me
[1:49:29] lame. And even in my
[1:49:33] weakness, the Savior called my name.
[1:49:38] And in his holy presence, I'm healed and
[1:49:44] unashamed as I'm carried to the
[1:49:52] table. Sitting where I don't
[1:50:00] belong. I was carried to the table.
[1:50:09] swept away by his
[1:50:18] love. And I don't see my brokenness
[1:50:23] anymore.
[1:50:27] When I'm seated at the table of the
[1:50:31] Lord, I was carried to the
[1:50:39] table, the table of the
[1:50:47] Lord. I was carried to the table.
[1:50:56] table of the
[1:51:04] [Music]
[1:51:08] Lord.
[1:51:09] Almighty
[1:51:12] God, the great I am. When God ran
[1:51:19] immovable
[1:51:21] rock,
[1:51:23] omnipotent,
[1:51:25] powerful, awesome
[1:51:31] Lord,
[1:51:33] victorious
[1:51:39] warrior, commanding king of
[1:51:42] kings and mighty conqueror.
[1:51:46] And the only
[1:51:50] [Music]
[1:51:53] time, yes, the only time I ever saw him
[1:52:00] run was when he ran to me.
[1:52:05] He took me in his arms, held my head to
[1:52:10] his chest, and said, "My son, come home
[1:52:15] again." Lifted my
[1:52:18] face. Wipe the tears from my eyes
[1:52:23] with his
[1:52:25] voice. He says,
[1:52:27] "Son, do you know I still
[1:52:31] love you?
[1:52:35] [Music]
[1:52:38] Oh, he caught me
[1:52:40] by
[1:52:43] surprise. When
[1:52:51] God the day I left
[1:52:57] home, I knew I broke his heart.
[1:53:06] And I wonder
[1:53:09] then if things could ever be the
[1:53:13] same.
[1:53:15] Then one
[1:53:19] night I
[1:53:21] remember his love for me.
[1:53:28] And down the dusty
[1:53:30] road the head I could see. It was the
[1:53:35] only
[1:53:40] time. It was the only time I ever saw
[1:53:47] [Music]
[1:53:50] him was when
[1:53:52] he me.
[1:53:55] He took me in his arms, held my head to
[1:54:00] his chest, and set my
[1:54:03] son home again. Lifting my face, wip the
[1:54:09] tears from my eyes
[1:54:13] with his voice. Jesus, son. Do you know
[1:54:19] I still love you?
[1:54:26] He caught me
[1:54:29] by
[1:54:32] surprise and he brought me to my
[1:54:38] knees. When God
[1:54:45] raised, I saw him run to me.
[1:54:51] He took me in his arms, held my head to
[1:54:55] his chest, and said my son's come home
[1:55:01] again. Lifted my face. Wipe the tears
[1:55:05] from my
[1:55:08] eyes. This is I feel his
[1:55:14] love. He sent to me.
[1:55:18] He took me in his arms, held my head to
[1:55:23] his chest, and said, "My son's come home
[1:55:27] again." Lifting my face, wipe the tears
[1:55:32] from my
[1:55:35] eyes. In his voice, he said,

[2:02:41] beyond the highest
[2:02:46] star and reaches
[2:02:51] to the Lord's
[2:02:56] way. The guilty

[2:03:06] God
[2:03:10] gives
[2:03:11] to
[2:03:14] him his very
