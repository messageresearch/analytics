[17:09] praise the name of the lord i mean he
[17:12] can say it as well
[17:14] because god's still on the throne amen
[17:17] amen we have quite a few needs here
[17:19] tonight we want to
[17:20] remember the saints at happy valley
[17:23] church
[17:24] in tennessee they're having a battle
[17:27] with covid
[17:28] just ask the lord to be merciful those
[17:30] that's in the hospitals
[17:32] several of them there asked the lord to
[17:34] move on their behalf
[17:36] also brother jeff smith's mom's in the
[17:38] hospital with covert and pneumonia
[17:41] today sister ladonna smith or during the
[17:44] night she was taken to the hospital
[17:46] with covet and they've already put her
[17:49] on her vent
[17:50] she's been here in our assembly just in
[17:52] the last months
[17:55] we're gonna ask god to intervene for her
[17:58] tonight
[18:00] you know i i don't know about you but
[18:01] i'm tired of this devil
[18:04] tormenting the children of god
[18:05] tormenting us when we come to the house
[18:07] of god
[18:08] trying to put fear and every kind of
[18:10] thing in our mind
[18:12] and i believe there's a word against
[18:14] that
[18:15] and i believe god's here to move in our
[18:17] midst to move for these needs and
[18:19] and to stand against this thing because
[18:22] you know the prophet of god would say it
[18:23] he said when all hell turns loose
[18:25] all heaven turns loose with it so we're
[18:28] seeing hell but i'm looking for heaven
[18:31] amen for god to move for his children
[18:34] amen we have brother mickey king that's
[18:36] been battling cancer and we understand
[18:38] that he's
[18:39] had a stroke and just a real dire
[18:42] situation
[18:44] asked the lord to be merciful on his
[18:45] behalf sister margaret coleman
[18:48] was going with her two sons to visit
[18:51] her oldest son in the hospital and with
[18:54] their crazy restrictions and things they
[18:56] got going on they would only allow one
[18:58] person in
[18:59] at a time to the hospital and so brother
[19:02] ben went in there and while he was in
[19:03] there
[19:04] she had asked to use the restroom and
[19:06] they told her no you can't come in the
[19:07] hospital use the restroom go across
[19:10] the street to the restaurant and i'm
[19:12] just going to ask you what sense does
[19:13] that make
[19:15] but anyway she went across the road and
[19:18] fell
[19:18] and hit her head on the curb now she's
[19:20] in the er there
[19:21] in that hospital and and had some
[19:24] bleeding on the brain and so
[19:26] we're just asking the lord to be
[19:27] merciful on their behalf
[19:30] amen and so also we have
[19:33] sister barbara wrestler's niece beth ann
[19:36] from houston's working in the hospitals
[19:39] there and just
[19:40] having a hard time again with coving so
[19:43] we want to remember all of those that
[19:44] are having to be in those situations
[19:47] they got to be merciful and we got
[19:50] several nurses here and and people that
[19:52] works in hospitals here and
[19:54] we're just praying god's protection
[19:56] around you
[19:57] during these times of course i want to
[19:59] continue to remember
[20:00] sister karen my mom sister karen we
[20:03] visited her today
[20:05] actually with some responses from her
[20:07] today
[20:08] and uh so we're just she's resting easy
[20:12] right now and we're just believing that
[20:14] god is moving in an impossible situation
[20:18] amen and i believe he's that kind of god
[20:21] i also want to continue to remember
[20:22] brother ron spencer
[20:24] as he battles with this cancer
[20:27] he's here tonight to minister to you
[20:30] tonight he's been
[20:32] with us since monday him sister connie
[20:34] flew in and
[20:35] been just a real strength to us during
[20:37] this difficult time
[20:38] also brother donny reagan came even in
[20:40] the middle of all the things that's
[20:42] going on at his church he felt to come
[20:44] he drove down
[20:45] on monday was with us monday evening all
[20:48] day yesterday drove back this morning at
[20:50] home now
[20:52] we really thank him for being with us
[20:54] and supporting us we got
[20:56] the john andes has come and supporting
[20:58] us during this time and
[21:00] it means the world to know that amen
[21:02] god's got people all over the world
[21:04] that's
[21:05] that's got you back amen the prophet of
[21:08] god said we are the final voice to the
[21:10] final age
[21:12] so our voice means something it has
[21:14] power in it because it's not our words
[21:16] that we speak
[21:17] it's his words that we speak and so we
[21:20] want to take all these needs before the
[21:22] lord and
[21:23] ask god to come on the scene for the
[21:25] behalf of his children
[21:26] that's brother john andes to come and
[21:29] greet you
[21:29] into and to pray for these needs this
[21:32] evening let's pray together
[21:35] god bless you tonight we're here to
[21:37] support you
[21:39] and strengthen you just by our presence
[21:41] let you know that
[21:42] the love of god is with you and as we
[21:45] pray tonight remember god

[47:57] one that we're facing with sister karen
[48:00] may look impossible but i want to remind
[48:03] you
[48:04] that about 13 to 14 years ago i was
[48:07] brain dead
[48:08] and they were going to harvest my organs
[48:10] in a few hours
[48:13] and god sent a general
[48:18] hallelujah and i woke up
[48:22] god's still the same god tonight
[48:26] he's not any different than when he
[48:28] walked to lazarus's grave
[48:32] and he called him by name and lazarus
[48:35] came from another dimension back
[48:38] and the next day they would be having
[48:40] dinner together
[48:42] and he would be sitting at the feet of
[48:43] jesus i want to remind you
[48:46] nothing is impossible with god
[48:51] isaiah chapter 59 in verse 1
[48:55] behold the lord's hand is not shortened
[48:58] that he cannot save it cannot save
[49:01] neither here's ear
[49:03] heavy that it cannot hear and judgment
[49:06] is turned away backward
[49:07] and just to stand at the far off for
[49:10] truth is falling in the streets and
[49:13] and equity cannot enter yea
[49:17] truth faileth and he that departed from
[49:20] evil maketh
[49:21] himself up a prey and the lord saw it
[49:24] and it depleased him
[49:26] that there was no judgment and he saw
[49:29] that there was no man
[49:30] and wondered and there was no
[49:33] intercessor therefore his arm brought
[49:35] salvation
[49:36] unto him and his righteousness and it
[49:39] sustained him
[49:41] for he put on righteousness
[49:44] as a breastplate and a helmet of
[49:47] salvation upon his head
[49:49] and he put on the garments of vengeance
[49:53] for clothing and he clad the zeal as a
[49:56] clothe
[49:57] according to their deeds accordingly
[50:00] he will repay fury to his
[50:03] adversaries recompense to his enemies
[50:07] to the islands he shall repay recompense
[50:11] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[50:14] from the west
[50:15] and from the glory of the rising of the
[50:17] sun when the
[50:19] enemy shall come in like a flood the
[50:21] spirit of the lord shall lift up a
[50:24] standard against it
[50:25] and the redeemer shall rise to zion and
[50:28] up
[50:28] upon them that turn transgression to
[50:31] jacob
[50:32] saith the lord as for me this is my
[50:35] covenant with
[50:36] with them saith the lord my spirit is
[50:39] upon thee and my words which
[50:43] i have put in thy mouth shall not depart
[50:46] out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of
[50:48] thy seed
[50:50] nor thy s out of the mouth of thy seed
[50:52] seed
[50:53] saith the lord from henceforth forever

[51:00] reading of his word this evening

[1:10:47] his purpose
[1:10:49] for whom he did for know them he also
[1:10:51] did predecimate to be conformed to the
[1:10:54] image of his son
[1:10:55] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:10:57] many brethren
[1:10:59] moreover whom he did predestinate them

[1:11:26] his own son but delivered him up for us

[1:11:37] everything you need is at his disposal
[1:11:44] your lost children he still saves
[1:11:50] regardless of what that's what the
[1:11:52] doctor is saying about you
[1:11:53] he still heals
[1:11:57] this week we had two major appointments
[1:12:01] and had scans the doctor spent a little
[1:12:04] time with us and
[1:12:06] she's a wonderful doctor the head won
[1:12:09] and she
[1:12:10] brother tim's met her
[1:12:14] she said i said i just asked her what
[1:12:18] she thought where she thought we were
[1:12:20] she said
[1:12:22] we have you on the highest chemo that we
[1:12:24] can possibly give you
[1:12:26] you're taking that every day twice a day
[1:12:29] it's the highest chemo that we can give
[1:12:31] you she said you just stay the course
[1:12:37] your prayers are working
[1:12:41] hallelujah you're on an invincible team
[1:12:45] when the doctor says you're going to die
[1:12:48] walk with god
[1:12:51] whatever you do just keep walking with
[1:12:53] god
[1:12:57] hallelujah who shall separate us from
[1:13:00] the love of christ
[1:13:02] your tribulation distress or persecution
[1:13:05] or famine or nakedness or peril sword
[1:13:07] as it is written for thy sake we're
[1:13:09] killed all the day long and we're
[1:13:11] accounted as sheep for
[1:13:12] slaughter nay and all of these things
[1:13:15] we are more than conquerors through him
[1:13:17] that loved us
[1:13:18] for i am persuaded this is a man writing
[1:13:22] from prison
[1:13:23] for i am persuaded that neither death
[1:13:27] nor
[1:13:27] life nor angels or principalities no
[1:13:30] powers
[1:13:31] no things present or things to come nor
[1:13:34] height nor debt
[1:13:35] or any other creature shall be able to
[1:13:37] separate us from the love of god
[1:13:39] which is in christ jesus our lord
[1:13:48] hallelujah let me just
[1:13:52] share with you another statement be be
[1:13:54] still and know that i'm god
[1:13:57] i'm bigger than your problem i'm bigger
[1:14:00] than your circumstance
[1:14:02] i'm bigger than your situation this is
[1:14:05] not your battle
[1:14:07] you don't have to handle this
[1:14:10] this is god's battle and god will work
[1:14:14] it out all you have to do is be still
[1:14:17] and know that i am god
[1:14:21] brother branham said every every word of
[1:14:24] god is a seed and if that seed can be
[1:14:27] planted
[1:14:28] by the inexhaustible fountain of life
[1:14:31] which is christ the believer has to
[1:14:33] drink beyond his imagination drink and
[1:14:36] punch it out
[1:14:37] push out everything you have need of
[1:14:39] cause it's in you
[1:14:42] when you receive christ we're planted
[1:14:43] together in christ
[1:14:45] and he is the inexhaustible you talk
[1:14:48] about unlimited
[1:14:49] he is the inexhaustible
[1:14:52] fountain of life
[1:14:56] don't never be afraid to ask big things
[1:15:02] god wants you to ask big things he don't
[1:15:06] want you to be a petty juvenile
[1:15:08] he wants you to ask big things that your
[1:15:12] joy may be full
[1:15:16] then brother adam gives us an example
[1:15:18] could you
[1:15:19] imagine a little fish about that big way
[1:15:22] out you under the atlantic ocean
[1:15:24] say i better not drink just a little bit
[1:15:27] of this water i may run out
[1:15:29] nonsense could you imagine a little
[1:15:32] mouse
[1:15:33] about to bring down there being down
[1:15:36] there in the big there are the great big
[1:15:39] garners of egypt saying i just better
[1:15:42] eat two or grains a day
[1:15:44] because i might run out before
[1:15:46] summertime again
[1:15:47] that's nonsense if they had
[1:15:51] ten hundred thousand rats
[1:15:54] that size they'd never eat it up
[1:16:00] and they had billions times billions
[1:16:03] tons
[1:16:03] of them fish they'd never drink up that
[1:16:06] water
[1:16:08] how many times could we multiply you
[1:16:11] could never
[1:16:12] exhaust god
[1:16:18] in his powers in his mercies
[1:16:22] you don't have to beg god it's at your
[1:16:25] disposal
[1:16:29] he's the inexhaustible fountain
[1:16:32] of life drink drink

[1:16:46] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:16:49] giving satan a break to kind of catch
[1:16:51] his breath
[1:16:55] what about the power of your prayer
[1:16:59] what about the power of your prayer many
[1:17:01] times we send in prayer requests that we
[1:17:03] didn't pray for
[1:17:06] a lot of times we expect god to do
[1:17:08] things that we didn't ask for
[1:17:12] but you're a son of god and so you must
[1:17:13] exercise your rights
[1:17:17] more than entitlement you've got to
[1:17:19] exercise your rights
[1:17:22] you've got to pray and sometimes you've
[1:17:25] got to break beyond the realm of
[1:17:28] more than now i lay me down to sleep
[1:17:30] you've got to break into the realm
[1:17:33] of the spirit of prayer
[1:17:37] sometimes you come to church and you sit
[1:17:38] down and you're wore out and you're
[1:17:40] tired and you're just sitting there
[1:17:42] and you're thinking well i want to be
[1:17:43] entertained you got to break beyond the
[1:17:46] realm
[1:17:47] of even your flesh
[1:17:50] i'm beginning to worship the lord i
[1:17:53] didn't get out of anything out of
[1:17:54] service you didn't put nothing in
[1:17:58] come on church we come to church
[1:18:03] and we get into the spirit of the realm
[1:18:05] of church
[1:18:07] and we begin to pull on the word of god
[1:18:09] and all of a sudden god is at your house
[1:18:12] he's dealing with your need for the word
[1:18:14] is a discerner the thoughts of the heart
[1:18:16] and all of a sudden you're breaking
[1:18:19] through and the demons in your life is
[1:18:21] being defeated
[1:18:23] we do not have to negotiate with the
[1:18:25] devil
[1:18:26] and settle for less than what god has
[1:18:28] given to us
[1:18:34] we've come to do more than set on a pew
[1:18:36] and occupy the pew
[1:18:37] and say i'm here but we've come to have
[1:18:40] war
[1:18:42] we're in laodicea but we don't come here
[1:18:44] and say well i'm just going to be a
[1:18:46] lukewarm believer
[1:18:47] we're an overcomer and that's sometimes
[1:18:49] you got to wrestle
[1:18:54] hallelujah moses prayed
[1:18:58] and the greatest the greatest soldiers
[1:19:02] became fish food
[1:19:07] did you catch it moses prayed
[1:19:12] and the greatest army in the world
[1:19:15] became fish food
[1:19:20] daniel prayed and lines laid down
[1:19:26] and later would eat his adversaries
[1:19:31] elijah prayed and outran
[1:19:35] the greatest horses 40 miles
[1:19:40] you talking about a marathon runner
[1:19:44] prophet of god was the greatest olympian
[1:19:46] in history
[1:19:51] i'm paying attention to the olympics i
[1:19:53] want to tell you about an olympian
[1:19:56] a prophet of god he prayed
[1:19:59] and he outran the greatest horses of
[1:20:02] that day
[1:20:06] satan you know that's a truth
[1:20:14] jesus was up on the top of a mountain
[1:20:17] and he sat down and he rebuked him again
[1:20:21] with the word of god
[1:20:23] now he could have rebuked him with his
[1:20:26] power
[1:20:27] but he chose the word knowing that you
[1:20:30] were going to take some of the same
[1:20:32] scriptures that i have given to you
[1:20:34] tonight
[1:20:35] because that's god's word seed form
[1:20:39] it was a thought then it was a seed then
[1:20:41] it was in a prophet then he wrote it
[1:20:43] down
[1:20:43] and it doesn't have a time limitation to
[1:20:46] it
[1:20:47] and you can believe it but when it grows
[1:20:49] across your lips it goes into action
[1:20:55] hallelujah and he defeated satan with
[1:20:57] the word of god showing that the
[1:20:59] weakest of christian can defeat
[1:21:03] satan with thus saith the lord it is
[1:21:06] written
[1:21:07] it is written it is written
[1:21:17] david said this the lord is my shepherd
[1:21:21] and i shall not want
[1:21:24] he maketh me to lie down in green
[1:21:26] pastures and he leadeth me beside of the
[1:21:28] still waters
[1:21:29] and he restoreth my soul this is more
[1:21:32] than just a good song
[1:21:34] this got power in it
[1:21:38] and he leads with me in the past of
[1:21:39] righteousness for his name's sake
[1:21:41] and yea though i walk through the valley
[1:21:43] of the shadow of death i will fear no
[1:21:45] evil
[1:21:46] for thou art with me listen
[1:21:49] god's always with you good times
[1:21:53] and in crisis
[1:22:00] by rod and thy staff they comfort me
[1:22:03] thou preparest the table before me
[1:22:05] in the presence of my enemies thou
[1:22:08] anointest my head with all
[1:22:10] my cup runneth over surely goodness and
[1:22:14] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[1:22:16] life and i will dwell in the house of
[1:22:17] the lord
[1:22:18] forever he also writes in psalms 27
[1:22:23] the lord is my light and my salvation
[1:22:25] whom shall i fear
[1:22:28] the lord is the strength of my life of
[1:22:31] whom shall i be afraid
[1:22:39] when the wicked even my enemies
[1:22:43] and my foes came up on me to eat up my
[1:22:46] flesh
[1:22:48] they stumbled and fail
[1:22:55] those cancer devils we've got some
[1:22:57] testimonies all over this building those
[1:22:59] cancer devils has come up against you
[1:23:02] they stumbled
[1:23:06] and they fail
[1:23:10] it must be a mystery to a lot of people
[1:23:12] in the cancer center where i go
[1:23:14] i've been there a year and a half now i
[1:23:17] seem to get me getting stronger instead
[1:23:20] of getting weaker
[1:23:24] one of the doctors told me the other day
[1:23:26] the whole world was beginning to know
[1:23:27] about your case
[1:23:30] in the doctor community they're
[1:23:31] beginning to know about your case you're
[1:23:32] getting into that one percent category
[1:23:38] we're only getting started
[1:23:56] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[1:24:00] me in his pavilion
[1:24:02] in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[1:24:04] hide me and he shall set me up on a rock
[1:24:07] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[1:24:09] my enemies round about
[1:24:10] therefore will i offer in his tabernacle
[1:24:14] sacrifices of joy i will
[1:24:17] sing yay
[1:24:20] i will sing
[1:24:23] i've been with your pastor over the last
[1:24:25] few days and listen
[1:24:27] i've never heard him whining and crying
[1:24:30] i've heard him singing and quoting
[1:24:32] scriptures
[1:24:33] [Applause]
[1:24:36] hallelujah in our flesh we have no
[1:24:39] power against the enemy but under the
[1:24:42] word of god
[1:24:44] [Applause]
[1:24:45] it's an uneven fight
[1:24:49] it's absolutely an uneven fight
[1:24:54] satan thought he had the odds on little
[1:24:56] david but it was an uneven
[1:24:59] fight you can't go by your eyesight
[1:25:06] hallelujah you cannot go by your
[1:25:09] eyesight
[1:25:11] our prophet was a little bitty man
[1:25:15] but if you was only looking at him you
[1:25:16] missed the whole picture
[1:25:19] angels of god was standing around to con
[1:25:22] to
[1:25:22] to take this word and to bring it to
[1:25:25] pass
[1:25:28] satan tried to block you from hearing
[1:25:30] the message of the
[1:25:31] hour he tried to destroy your life
[1:25:34] and mar your life he tried to put you to
[1:25:38] where you wouldn't hear it
[1:25:39] but your ears heard the word of god
[1:25:42] and there was nothing brother philip
[1:25:45] that the devil could do
[1:25:46] to stop you
[1:25:50] from recognizing who you are
[1:25:54] and when you recognize who you are
[1:25:56] there's
[1:25:57] nothing can defeat you
[1:26:08] psalms 91 he that dwelleth in the secret
[1:26:11] place of the most high shall abide under
[1:26:13] the
[1:26:14] shadow of the almighty i will say of the
[1:26:18] lord he
[1:26:18] is my refuge and my fortress
[1:26:21] my god in him will i trust
[1:26:26] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[1:26:28] snare of the fowl and for the noise of
[1:26:29] pestilence
[1:26:30] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[1:26:32] and under his wings shalt thou trust
[1:26:34] his truth shall be thy shield and
[1:26:36] buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the
[1:26:38] terror by night nor the error that flies
[1:26:40] by day
[1:26:41] nor the pestilence that walketh at
[1:26:43] noonday
[1:26:44] nor the destruction that wastes at the
[1:26:46] noonday a thousand shall fall at thy
[1:26:48] side and ten thousand
[1:26:50] at the right hand but it shall not come
[1:26:52] nigh thee
[1:26:53] only with thine eyes shall thou behold
[1:26:56] behold the see the reward of the wicked
[1:26:58] because thou has made the lord which is
[1:27:01] my refuge even the most high thy
[1:27:03] habitation
[1:27:04] there shall no evil befall thee neither
[1:27:06] shall any plague come now thy dwelling
[1:27:09] for he shall give his angels charge over
[1:27:12] thee
[1:27:16] to keep thee in all thy
[1:27:20] ways
[1:27:27] brother ron have you have you had your
[1:27:29] head in a
[1:27:30] cave somewhere don't you read the news

[1:27:39] i do
[1:27:43] but i'm making a response
[1:27:47] [Music]
[1:27:50] i'm making a response
[1:27:55] very familiar to you who hath believed
[1:27:59] our report
[1:28:02] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[1:28:03] revealed
[1:28:05] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:28:07] tender plant as a root out of dry ground
[1:28:09] and he hath no formal covenants and when
[1:28:11] we shall see him there is no beauty
[1:28:13] that we should desire him he is despised
[1:28:16] and rejected of men a man of sorrows
[1:28:20] acquainted with grief
[1:28:24] brother ron i feel like the world has
[1:28:26] been pulled out from under me
[1:28:28] he's acquainted with that
[1:28:32] for a child of god for believer
[1:28:39] death is only an uber
[1:28:46] satan that is so powerful is only a taxi
[1:28:49] cab
[1:28:52] to get us from here to there
[1:28:56] brother ron if it be said it someday
[1:28:59] that cancer took you let me just say
[1:29:02] satan can't take
[1:29:04] [Applause]
[1:29:05] satan cannot take me he is only a
[1:29:09] tool in the hand of almighty god
[1:29:13] and i want to remind him
[1:29:16] if that would be the way that god would
[1:29:18] choose
[1:29:19] i win regardless
[1:29:32] hallelujah
[1:29:37] c.s lewis said it like this may
[1:29:40] all hell celebrate the day i die
[1:29:50] you didn't catch it may all hell
[1:29:52] celebrate the day i die
[1:29:54] i want to be the kind of enemy in god's
[1:29:57] hand
[1:29:59] that can have my sword pulled
[1:30:02] and be on the offense continually not
[1:30:05] running
[1:30:06] [Applause]
[1:30:10] i reminded my little buddy behind me i'm
[1:30:12] fighting with you

[1:30:17] worry about me
[1:30:18] fighting i'll be right there
[1:30:22] [Applause]
[1:30:26] i believe you can agree with that he has
[1:30:28] despised and rejected a man a man of
[1:30:31] sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid
[1:30:32] as it were our face is from him
[1:30:35] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[1:30:37] surely he hath borne our grief
[1:30:39] and carried our sorrows yet we did
[1:30:41] esteem him stricken
[1:30:43] and smitten of god and afflicted
[1:30:48] let's just let's just hone hell just for
[1:30:49] a minute he has heard this next
[1:30:51] scripture
[1:30:52] quoted over and over and over again and
[1:30:55] watched
[1:30:56] cancer patients people within seconds of
[1:31:00] death
[1:31:01] be retrieved back to life and step
[1:31:04] into a well body
[1:31:07] and we stand and testify
[1:31:11] he was wounded for our transgressions he
[1:31:14] was bruised for our iniquities
[1:31:16] the chastisement our peace was upon him
[1:31:20] and with his stripes we
[1:31:24] are healed
[1:31:33] psalms 18 verse 6 in my distress i
[1:31:37] called upon the lord and he
[1:31:38] cried unto my god and he heard my voice
[1:31:43] out of his temple and my cry came before

[1:32:38] that trusteth in him
[1:32:42] psalms 40 and verse 1 i waited patiently
[1:32:45] for the lord
[1:32:46] and he inclined unto me and heard my cry
[1:32:50] he brought me up also out of a horrible
[1:32:53] pit
[1:32:55] and out of a maori clay and sat my foot
[1:32:57] upon a rock
[1:32:59] and established my goings
[1:33:04] psalms 56 and verse 2 is this okay for

[1:33:12] they that be many fight against me
