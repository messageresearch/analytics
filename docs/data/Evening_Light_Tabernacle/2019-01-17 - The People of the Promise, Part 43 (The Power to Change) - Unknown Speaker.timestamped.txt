[9:19] sister Sandra Velasco she's asking us to
[9:22] pray for an urgent family need I also
[9:24] want to remember brother Kenneth he's
[9:26] not been feeling well today that the
[9:28] Lord would just be with him a man who
[9:31] asked brother Craig if you'll come open
[9:32] a service for us and prayer tonight
[9:35] Amen as we mentioned if we have a need
[9:37] we can lift it to him already and say
[9:39] praise God he has an answer for us a man
[9:42] but let's go to him together taking
[9:44] these needs no doubt many unwritten
[9:46] requests tonight the elderly that

[9:50] would love to be in our midst this
[9:51] evening and can't let's just take it to
[9:53] the Lord in prayer amen I may love the
[9:59] Lord it's good to be in the house of the
[10:01] Lord and brother Tim had just mentioned
[10:04] to me to maybe just make mention to the
[10:06] church that we've been having Bible
[10:08] studies on Tuesday nights we just
[10:10] restarted them last night
[10:12] since the holiday season and so forth
[10:15] has passed and had a good meeting last
[10:17] night where would be having one next
[10:19] week and we want to open it up to the
[10:23] public so if there's any friends or
[10:26] coworkers or family members or anyone
[10:28] that shows an interest in God or a
[10:30] hunger for God or an interest in the
[10:32] Scriptures we just want everyone to just
[10:35] feel free to bring them and we just be
[10:37] teaching subjects out of the word and I
[10:40] believe we'll just have a wonderful time
[10:42] and then if someone has inquiry they
[10:45] want to know more than we can work with
[10:47] those individuals one by one and deal
[10:48] with personal questions individual
[10:51] questions things that pertain to what's
[10:53] on their heart so we just want to open
[10:55] it up to everyone somewhat of an
[10:57] outreach just in our local area there
[11:00] are people all over the area they hunger
[11:03] for God but they don't know where to go
[11:04] and there's so much confusion in the
[11:07] land but we want to show evening light
[11:10] hold up a banner in the evening time
[11:12] that there's still Bible believing
[11:14] people that
[11:15] leave the Word of God and Christ is
[11:17] returning and there will be a bride
[11:19] without spot wrinkle or blemish and so

[28:26] we pray amen amen it's good to be in the
[28:31] house the Lord amen let's look at Romans
[28:34] chapter 12 mercy that song there didn't
[28:44] fire you up your woods wet he hang back
[28:49] in the back there but couldn't hardly
[28:50] hold myself together amen trying to get
[28:53] some things finished up here but anyway
[28:55] we just had a wonderful time there by
[28:58] the Josh Bennet's this week in North
[29:00] Carolina and he sends his greetings to
[29:02] you and the church hear him in the Lord
[29:06] and really moved on Saturday night
[29:08] especially with the young people and
[29:11] touching the hearts of the young people
[29:14] that that's something that means a lot
[29:15] to me that the young folks can have
[29:18] their moment with the king a man and in
[29:21] his presence and we saw Amen demons that
[29:24] were cast out and a man just getting a
[29:27] lot of good reports from that and the
[29:29] young folks so we're just thankful to
[29:30] the Lord a ministry here in Romans
[29:33] chapter 12 and verse 1 it says I beseech
[29:36] you therefore brethren by the mercies of
[29:38] God that you present your bodies a
[29:40] living sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[29:43] the Lord unto God which is your reason
[29:47] service and be not conformed to this
[29:50] world but be transformed by the renewing
[29:53] of your mind that you may be may prove
[29:56] what is that good and acceptable and
[29:59] perfect will of God amen would let you
[30:02] be seated this evening that's coming
[30:06] home and just begin to think on the word
[30:12] transformed and you know the word
[30:15] transform means to be changed it means
[30:18] to be made different than what it was
[30:20] before it's a it's a character and
[30:24] everything has been changed to be
[30:25] transformed you know truly that's what
[30:28] we desire in our lives
[30:30] amen we we don't desire even hear it
[30:33] even like tabernacle to to cause you to
[30:35] might want to just be maybe a good
[30:37] church member or you know a good person
[30:40] but we desire that your lives will be
[30:42] completely changed and and I believe a
[30:45] God who has the power to do that we
[30:48] witness it in our heart and our midst a
[30:50] man of every one of us would have
[30:51] testimonies of where and who we used to
[30:54] be and what we used to do but we met a
[30:57] power that was greater than what held us
[30:59] he man we met a power that was greater
[31:02] many men in this sitting in this
[31:03] building met a power that was greater
[31:06] than the alcohol that held you or the
[31:09] tobacco that held you or whatever kind
[31:11] of demon that would try to hold you you
[31:13] met something that was greater than that
[31:15] he meant so great that many of you in
[31:18] just a moment all it took was a moment
[31:20] and it was over amen and you were
[31:22] transformed never to go back to that
[31:24] again a man and we could look at this
[31:27] world even that we live in today and if
[31:29] we could take it back thousands of years
[31:31] ago we would find it to be a world that
[31:34] was without form
[31:35] it was void and darkness covered it
[31:38] completely it was in complete chaos it
[31:41] was no life there was darkness storms
[31:44] whipping all over it you know nothing to
[31:47] hold it whipping winds whipping in every
[31:49] direction but then a word was spoke and
[31:52] that word went out and the Holy Spirit
[31:55] we know follows that word
[31:57] amen you see when the past even when the
[32:00] preaching takes place amen the first
[32:03] thing you know is whoo
[32:04] right across the building goes the Holy
[32:05] Ghost amen the word is the conductor of
[32:08] the Spirit and when the word is preached
[32:10] the spirit follows it amen and when it
[32:14] goes out the spirit follows that word a
[32:16] mana fits the the Bible teaching the
[32:18] Bible Holy Ghost comes back and confirms
[32:21] Amen what has been taught if the Holy
[32:24] Ghost doesn't confirm it then we got our
[32:26] wires crossed somewhere Amen but the
[32:28] Holy Ghost goes there and the spirit
[32:30] would follow the Word of God as he would
[32:32] say let there be him and that that word
[32:35] would begin to take platform and would
[32:37] begin to take place and and we see even
[32:40] even a brother Brown speaking about God
[32:42] made man he said he began to speak the
[32:45] word and the Spirit of God begins to
[32:47] brood over the earth and out of that
[32:50] came East err flowers and out of that
[32:52] came every kind of species is that Holy
[32:54] Spirit begin to woo and draw that out of
[32:57] that earth amen and the and the Holy
[33:00] Spirit brooding it's uh it was like
[33:02] brooding means to be like a mother and
[33:04] uh you know as Jesus said I would I
[33:06] would brood over you as a mother hen
[33:08] over her chicks a man a brooding it's a
[33:11] creating the atmosphere that the word
[33:13] can be made manifest a man and I believe
[33:16] that's what we experience in our church
[33:18] servicing man as the Holy Ghost coming
[33:21] down as we even felt just a few minutes
[33:23] ago in a song or in the Word of God how
[33:26] it receives fit to call me madam begins
[33:29] to brood over our hearts and it begins
[33:31] to pull out of our lives and and he said
[33:34] he began to brood out Birds and then
[33:36] became animals and begin to get greater
[33:38] and greater until outstep the very
[33:40] reflection of him a man the brooding of
[33:43] God pulling out the image of God a man
[33:47] who said everything any higher a man
[33:48] than a man or our beloved woman she you
[33:51] know in the creation of God he said when
[33:54] this world that was in a condition that
[33:56] it was without form without void the
[33:58] Spirit of God began to move over it and
[34:01] the entire
[34:02] sure was changed he meant when the Holy
[34:04] Ghost comes the entire picture is chance
[34:08] hallelujah and that's a very direct
[34:10] revelation as if you've got the Holy
[34:13] Ghost or not that the entire picture has
[34:15] changed what you thought that what you
[34:18] thought was the great what you thought
[34:19] was wonderful now still seem to matter
[34:21] anymore amen the whole thing has changed
[34:24] it may begin to move and he said it
[34:27] turned it from total chaos to a Garden
[34:30] of Eden amen that's the power of this
[34:33] word that's a transpiler
[34:34] power of the word of God is a change of
[34:37] life from a life of chaos to a need and
[34:41] amen amen from a life of torment to a
[34:44] not life of peace and happiness promote
[34:46] ability to the power a menace here
[34:49] tonight to change sickness amen into
[34:51] health he meant we've witnessed the
[34:54] wooing of the holy ghost in our midst a
[34:56] man to take a woman sick with cancer and
[34:59] to turn it into health again we've seen
[35:01] the wooing of the Holy Ghost so take a
[35:03] man that was bound by every spirit of
[35:05] hailing and going to a sinner's grave in
[35:08] a devil's hell
[35:09] Amen but the Holy Ghost begin to woo and
[35:12] then maybe that life may have been dark
[35:14] without void amen storms all opponents
[35:17] miss but a word was spoken that life and
[35:20] that life was predestinated to come
[35:22] forth and and so the spirit followed
[35:25] that word and it began to draw it begin
[35:28] to pull Amen you remember the pool that
[35:30] you felt in your life even in this
[35:32] service some of you may not even
[35:33] understand why you're here but it's the
[35:35] Holy Ghost pulling upon your heart
[35:37] looking for life looking for truth
[35:39] looking for God and list looking for
[35:41] hope in the dying world there's a power
[35:43] here Amen the Holy Ghost that I'll take
[35:46] the vilest sinner and make him a
[35:48] virtuous child of God amen I'll lay my
[35:50] life out of control wonder don't know
[35:53] what's right and what's wrong spinning
[35:55] around in darkness but there is a power
[35:57] here amen to come upon the Word of God
[36:00] and to call life out of that body amen
[36:05] and so the earth in this dark chaotic
[36:08] condition but the Spirit of God begin to
[36:11] woo and begin to draw what the
[36:13] word spoke about the earth a minute
[36:16] changed it from chaos into a Garden of
[36:20] Eden
[36:20] you know I began to look in there me
[36:23] know after God had built his wonderful
[36:26] creation and it wasn't in a Garden of
[36:28] Eden there was no doubt there was no
[36:30] fear I mean the word fear wasn't even
[36:33] imagined yet I mean there was no death
[36:35] there was no die a man may be
[36:37] transformed all of this into a Garden of
[36:40] Eden him and it so changed what the
[36:43] world used to be and you know I
[36:46] but after after he had done that the
[36:49] enemy came and and you know the enemy
[36:51] don't have the power to transform he has
[36:54] the power to deform and so I began to
[36:58] look at these two words transformation
[37:00] and deformation or transform and deform
[37:04] and then the transformation is the act
[37:07] or the state of being changed it it's a
[37:10] marked change in appearance or character
[37:13] and it's always a transformation he said
[37:16] it is the word is used especially Amen
[37:19] for a change for the better
[37:22] Oh hallelujah every one of us can
[37:24] testify that God made a change in me and
[37:28] it was a change for the better
[37:30] amen a transformation is a change that
[37:33] increases value amen a deforming is a
[37:37] change alright but it's a change that
[37:40] alters the value but it don't increase
[37:42] it it devalues it and this is what Satan
[37:46] did to man you know he took it from a
[37:48] life of a wonderin and I mean and I
[37:51] think we can't even hardly imagine in
[37:53] the world that we live in and the things
[37:55] that we go through the mind battles and
[37:57] the spirits that we face Amen changed it
[37:59] from a life of no worries and no
[38:02] heartaches and no goodbyes and no
[38:04] trouble and to what we have now that
[38:07] sounds like it lost a lot of value
[38:09] he deformed the world that we live in in
[38:12] and and you know Brian was saying
[38:14] something about you know going into a
[38:16] cornfield one time and he said I would
[38:18] think of as a limb you know had fell off
[38:21] a tree and it fell on a stalk
[38:23] and that stock was trying his best to
[38:26] get up as straight as it was supposed to
[38:28] but there was something that was laying
[38:30] on him that was deforming it for what it
[38:32] was supposed to be and he said the stick
[38:35] was laying on him so we also find wild
[38:38] creepers that have come in and in her to
[38:40] begin to deform people and they they're
[38:42] not want to it that you know a creeper
[38:44] will come in and begin to push against a
[38:46] child of God until he can move off of
[38:48] his promises and it bends him in such a
[38:51] way to where he can't see the Godhead
[38:53] straighter he can't see the revelations
[38:56] that we have in this hour
[38:57] what is it is the creepers that are
[38:59] coming in sowed they meant by the enemy
[39:02] and he said it's there and he said we
[39:05] were used to try to take him and cut
[39:07] them out and pull him out and pull him
[39:09] out he said but he was always there
[39:11] trying to deform amen the seed that was
[39:15] there and he said we're all still in the
[39:17] image of God but some are so deformed
[39:20] until we walk contrary to what the word
[39:23] says we've to walk we talked country
[39:26] from what the word says we should talk
[39:27] we live contrary from what the word says
[39:31] that we should live amen seeing has done
[39:33] this evil to the daughters and sons of
[39:36] Almighty God he's a deep former to
[39:39] deform it to pervert it to change it
[39:42] from something what it was originally
[39:45] he man we see that Satan has had a
[39:48] mighty work in this hour that we live in
[39:50] in that he would take the Word of God
[39:51] and he would take the effect out of it
[39:54] hey man he would take it such a place to
[39:57] where people don't believe in a religion
[39:59] that has power but there is a power hey
[40:04] man there is a power that can raise a
[40:06] sinner and make him not just live with
[40:08] those things and look at you know come
[40:10] to church you okay just believe in God
[40:12] and you'll be safe but no there's a
[40:14] power that are transform that life then
[40:17] I'll take it from a life of sin and make
[40:20] live above and beyond that but creepers
[40:23] come in and say no we don't have that
[40:25] kind of power anymore but see God hates
[40:28] a powerless religion he hates a religion
[40:32] that says there's no power all these
[40:34] they have a form of God in this they
[40:36] have a form of righteousness they come
[40:39] to church they live you know seemingly
[40:41] okay good guy good neighbor good to this
[40:43] good to that but God wants something
[40:46] more than that the Bible said they would
[40:48] have a form of garden 'less but denied
[40:50] the power hey man he told that to
[40:55] Laodicea it says you're lukewarm you say
[40:58] you have need or nothing
[40:59] you have you out you're rich and
[41:01] increased with Goods but I say you're
[41:03] blind and naked and you don't know who
[41:05] you are
[41:07] Amen what happened something had been
[41:09] brought in their creeper to bring it to
[41:12] such a place that it didn't even
[41:14] recognize it was blind but see God hates
[41:19] a powerless religion it has to have
[41:22] power in it it has that sincerity and
[41:26] sincerity brings power and power brings
[41:29] real worship not forms of worship but
[41:33] genuine powerful worship to know you've
[41:36] passed from death unto life there's a
[41:40] change in a second place ye who at once
[41:42] dared in sins and trespasses yet hath he
[41:45] made alive he transformed unit oh my
[41:49] don't you know that if you were you find
[41:51] yourself in a dead condition it's an
[41:53] increase in value to find yourself now
[41:55] that who was dead to be made alive well
[41:59] hallelujah many of you were caught in
[42:01] forms of religion but in dead and all
[42:04] kind of creeds and dogmas of man but
[42:06] there's a power that raised you up and
[42:09] made you
[42:09] live again God wants to perform his word
[42:17] by his power but when the church denies
[42:22] his power how can you how can he perform
[42:24] and vindicate his word when the church
[42:28] explains everything away or saves us for
[42:30] another age somewhere how can God who
[42:33] wants to fulfill his word performing
[42:35] among the people and the people deny
[42:37] that he doesn't if the people deny that
[42:41] he heals and he can heal hear the people
[42:47] denies that he don't save no Lord he
[42:49] don't feel no of the Holy Ghost no more
[42:51] Mercy's over he can't provide none of
[42:54] that but God hates the former religion
[42:57] he hates a powerless religion God wants
[43:02] to perform by the Holy Ghost vindicate
[43:05] his word and the church wants to perform
[43:07] but see they have didn't hide the Holy
[43:09] Ghost they want to make a big
[43:10] organization somewhere make a big
[43:12] membership Amen I tell you right now
[43:15] we're not interested in a big membership
[43:17] we're not interested with names on a
[43:19] book somewhere we're not interested in
[43:21] shaking hands with a preacher that's not
[43:23] former religion I'm not interested in
[43:25] just having a forum where I'll come and
[43:27] I do my little ritual and suddenly or
[43:29] Wednesday I want my life to have the
[43:32] power of the Holy Ghost vindicated on
[43:34] the inside people joined churches and
[43:40] called it I got South saved as blasphemy
[43:44] ain't about joining churches a menace
[43:47] about dying out and giving yourself to
[43:52] him be born again you know there was a
[44:03] young man one time in a paradox he says
[44:09] there's a young man one time that never
[44:11] had experienced the baptism of the Holy
[44:13] Ghost was in some formal you know Church
[44:17] didn't believe in it and he says he said
[44:21] but until your life has change
[44:23] and a miracle takes place like that
[44:26] unless that happens you can't be a
[44:28] Christian there must be a you become a
[44:32] Christian there must be a change in the
[44:34] spirit of man to give him a new birth
[44:36] and God alone Saul the one can do that
[44:39] he said you know I went to one time to a
[44:41] very fine boy it was going with a little
[44:43] girl very fine little girl out of a fine
[44:46] family
[44:46] sounds good doing it fine boy fine girl
[44:49] fine family this boy all of a sudden
[44:52] came up with some idea and he just
[44:54] walked away he'd done something wrong to
[44:56] that little girl and promised to do a
[44:58] certain thing that wouldn't do it
[44:59] instead of coming to the girl and
[45:00] apologizing like a gentleman should it
[45:03] wasn't in him to do it and so the father
[45:05] and mother called to the scenes that we
[45:07] desire to know what's wrong with our boy
[45:10] he said it's not easy to do sometime but
[45:12] you must be truthful and honest he said
[45:15] therefore the boy was a Christian as far
[45:17] as a believer he had repented he had
[45:21] been baptized he had his position but he
[45:24] had not yet received the baptism of the
[45:26] Holy Spirit no matter how much he
[45:29] thought he had he said you thinking you
[45:33] have it and having it it's two different
[45:35] things you might be able to say you have
[45:38] it you might better show some evidence
[45:40] of emotion but unless your life is
[45:43] vindicated
[45:45] Amen that you have been changed Amen in
[45:48] vindicating what you're possessing to
[45:50] have you still haven't died no matter
[45:54] how many emotions how much jump run
[45:56] shout sensation speaking in tongues all
[45:59] these things are alright I believe in
[46:01] him but unless your life coach with your
[46:04] testimony you haven't got what you say
[46:07] you have hey man this young fellas
[46:12] parents his mother was German he said
[46:15] there's no reflection on the German but
[46:17] there's a strain in that family so they
[46:19] just sit and you can talk to them and
[46:21] they stare you right in the face oh yeah
[46:24] we got Germans in church guarantee you
[46:29] he may even preach your heart out and
[46:31] then look at you you know if he said you
[46:34] can wave at him you can say good morning
[46:37] and they'll just stand there and look at
[46:38] you he said it's a strain in that family
[46:41] and then in that gene he said I sure you
[46:44] say I've chiffon sir fine morning just
[46:46] stand and look at you and it send an
[46:48] intelligent woman and I come to say I'd
[46:52] say come to see us sometimes she doesn't
[46:54] stand and look well our brother and
[46:57] their father your mother that way the
[46:59] brother this father this boy strictly
[47:01] harsh moody hot-tempered high-strung oh
[47:06] as some Irishman's here - that's his
[47:09] whole family except one out of the
[47:13] family who's been filled with the Holy
[47:16] Ghost the father and mother both are
[47:20] Christians filled with the Holy Ghost
[47:22] they brought this young man in the way
[47:24] of the Lord and now the young man is
[47:26] about 17 18 years old fine kid real
[47:29] model Boyd home he's got a brother
[47:31] that's just vice versa but all these
[47:33] others are trying to do right and his
[47:35] boys trying to do right but he said the
[47:37] genes of the father and mother is in
[47:39] this boy no matter how much they are
[47:42] converted the father mother know much
[47:45] how they are converted still remains in
[47:48] the flesh and has been interpreted to
[47:50] this boy therefore the boys kind of
[47:52] complex in him just like his mother's
[47:54] family will forgive won't apologize and
[47:58] that's where the boy stands today and he
[48:02] said you know I said to the father you
[48:05] know no matter how much you've raised
[48:06] him up look at you you sit down all your
[48:10] families are drunks fighting shooting
[48:12] cutting people so forth
[48:14] said to the mother look at your family
[48:16] they're a bunch of people that sit there
[48:17] won't speak just irreverent to religion
[48:20] but he said that's not you you're the
[48:23] only one out of all your sisters and
[48:25] brothers and your sweet kind of
[48:26] forgiving what does that the Holy Ghost
[48:32] that's the thing that made you tender
[48:34] and sweet
[48:35] not your people anymore it's Christ
[48:38] living on the inside of you hallelujah
[48:43] I said to the boy look at your family
[48:45] practically all of them but the father
[48:47] of drunks moody hot-tempered high stroke
[48:50] but you're kind and you're forgiven what
[48:52] is it the Holy Spirit it's not you it's
[48:56] Christ living in you and I said now the
[49:02] same thing has to happen to your son
[49:04] father raised up said my son went to the
[49:07] altar he is baptized correctly in the
[49:10] name of Jesus Christ all they say I know
[49:12] my son has come to Christ he said that
[49:14] might be all right as far as outward
[49:17] motions he might be identified with
[49:19] believer as with believers but until he
[49:23] is born again he receives the Holy Ghost
[49:26] I'd advise that young man and never
[49:28] marry a woman because you'll make hell
[49:30] on earth under that gentle sweet
[49:33] forgiving Spirit of Christ comes in he
[49:36] said then his nature will be changed and
[49:38] it will take the very nature that's been
[49:40] bred and through to the loss of the
[49:43] genes of his father and a mother and all
[49:45] his intellectuals and trying his best
[49:47] overcoming he'll never overcome it on
[49:49] his own but there is a power he can
[49:52] receive hallelujah there's a power here
[49:56] tonight that will change your whole body
[49:59] it'll change your mind it'll change your
[50:02] thinking it'll change your attitude
[50:07] it'll change it all what is the
[50:13] transformation how do we get this why
[50:18] what does this transformation do God
[50:21] does it by the spirit of his word he
[50:24] plants the seed and he throws his spirit
[50:27] on it and it brings forth what it was
[50:29] supposed to be hallelujah his only
[50:32] spirit transforms a sea to be the
[50:34] vindication of its kind so as he planted
[50:39] the corn and he planted the the the rose
[50:41] bushes and all kinds of flowers and
[50:43] every kind of species and he said and he
[50:46] began to brew over it in its throat his
[50:49] Holy Ghost on it his spirit on it and it
[50:52] began to pull and it pulled out corn and
[50:55] they pulled out tomatoes and it pulled
[50:57] out flowers of every kind it pulled it
[50:59] all out what was it the power that was
[51:02] in that spirit and if he could pull that
[51:05] out of a cold earth remember the word
[51:08] had been spoken
[51:10] can it also do it upon men and women who
[51:13] the word has been spoke about and the
[51:16] word calls you sons and daughters of God
[51:18] and it don't matter how much the devil
[51:20] tries to cover you over with darkness
[51:23] and fear and anxiety and I believe when
[51:26] that spirit begins to woo it's going to
[51:28] come forward because that power is
[51:31] greater than what holds in what harms
[51:34] the power to transform is greater than
[51:38] the power that deforms amen what kind of
[51:47] seeds you are to show what's on the
[51:49] inside of you you can't hide it whatever
[51:52] you are it shows on the outside you
[51:54] can't keep from it you can't make the
[51:57] tree anything but what it is it's going
[51:59] to come forward so if it's a seed of an
[52:01] apple put in there you can't change it
[52:03] it ain't going to change as far as
[52:05] humanly spit abilities the builders come
[52:07] and bring it into a peach or a parent
[52:09] but it's already been put in there
[52:11] there's nothing I can do to change it oh
[52:14] my man there's nothing I can do to keep
[52:17] it from coming forth if it's
[52:18] predestinated to life and if that seed
[52:20] of God was placed in your hearts before
[52:23] the foundation of the world they need a
[52:25] devil contain that nothing he can do to
[52:27] keep her from coming he can't cover it
[52:30] up with enough seeing enough creeds and
[52:32] enough dogmas and enough things of this
[52:34] world to keep it from coming to pass it
[52:37] will come to fruition and manifestation
[52:46] another day that the world laid in
[52:48] darkness in chaos all kinds of religions
[52:52] washing of hands pots wearing different
[52:55] kind of robes so forth laying in the
[52:57] midst of utter chaos the genuine Israel
[53:02] of God had been so perverted and so bent
[53:05] from the laws and statutes of God to
[53:07] what God says your your sacrifices are
[53:10] nothing but a bunch of traditions you
[53:14] and your traditions make the Word of no
[53:16] effect your traditions has calls this
[53:19] these creepers have come in and turned
[53:21] what was to be holy and what was to be
[53:23] righteous into nothing but a bunch of
[53:25] changing the money and changing of you
[53:28] know a good skit together until what God
[53:30] was saying become a stink in my nostrils
[53:32] it became nothing but a traditional God
[53:35] help us to keep the creepers cut back to
[53:39] what I worship don't come just a
[53:40] tradition or I have to our attitude
[53:44] towards Christ ain't just a tradition
[53:46] about I got to do my Christian duty but
[53:49] there's something on the inside of me
[53:51] that just probably and bubbling and I
[53:53] can't stop it from coming forth it's
[53:55] there and ain't nothing you can do to
[53:57] stop it and here there was a word spoke
[54:06] for that time of chaos Isaiah 6 behold
[54:11] or 9 and verse 6 that under us a child
[54:14] is born unto us a son is given his name
[54:17] shall be called counsellor the Prince of
[54:19] Peace the mighty God the everlasting
[54:21] father and of his reign there'll be no
[54:24] end and that word was God's Word it
[54:28] wasn't just the word of a man sure eyes
[54:30] he used Isaiah to speak it and people
[54:33] are like what are you talking about they
[54:34] couldn't grasp it but their Holy Ghost
[54:36] who followed the word and they began to
[54:39] search down through six hundred years
[54:41] until they found the recipient of that
[54:44] word and it was a little virgin walking
[54:46] down to a whale and she met the angel of
[54:49] God and it begins
[54:50] to pull from her the helm a highly
[54:53] favored maybe said me who you talking to
[54:56] me yes I'm talking to you man but
[54:58] holding you shall be formed ain't made a
[55:01] child of the Holy Ghost and his name and
[55:03] he begins to speak all these wonderful
[55:05] things and something so pulled out of
[55:07] her to where she can respond be it unto
[55:10] me
[55:11] be it unto me according to that word and
[55:14] in the middle of chaos God was
[55:16] fulfilling his word in the middle of all
[55:19] kind of darkness and every kind of
[55:22] religion of the world and things are
[55:24] Roman oppression God was fulfilling his
[55:26] word hallelujah and there wasn't enough
[55:29] death was lined up there that could keep
[55:32] that virgin from taking birth taking
[55:34] seed and giving birth and a little why
[55:36] come forward what was that why let my
[55:42] people go the devil tried he tried to
[55:47] spray it he tried to let a creeper come
[55:49] in he tried to turn him you don't come
[55:52] to himself well show me what you can do
[55:54] show me who you really are
[55:56] shall turn these stones into bread
[55:58] religious Devils still doing the same
[56:00] offers anything such as a thing as
[56:02] divine healing showed me let him heal
[56:05] somebody then I believe no they won't
[56:07] believe no the same devil stood at Jesus
[56:11] said if thou be the Son of God come off
[56:13] the cross the word said he was the son
[56:16] of God it didn't matter what the devil
[56:19] and his questions was the word said he
[56:21] was hallelujah amen they wasn't don't
[56:25] matter what the devil the devil may say
[56:27] about you or one of the critics may say
[56:29] or whatever anybody may say
[56:31] it only matters what the word said about
[56:33] you and then the word called you a son
[56:36] ain't nothing the devil can do about it
[56:40] but in the middle of chaos in the middle
[56:44] of his this Satan's eating trying to
[56:46] cover this world with all of his
[56:48] nonsense and it's getting worse and
[56:50] worse and worse
[56:51] listen witness world ain't getting
[56:53] better it's getting worse this world
[56:55] ain't getting lighter and more light is
[56:57] getting darker and darker and dark
[56:59] come on somebody and their men are
[57:02] impressions of the spirit center here I
[57:04] mean I find more young people bound by
[57:06] anxiety and fear and depression more
[57:09] than I've ever seen in my whole life
[57:10] maybe not just young people but
[57:13] everybody it's the spirit that is come
[57:16] and in the middle of this chaos there's
[57:18] a word that's been smoked hallelujah
[57:22] I'll have a bra without spot without
[57:25] wrinkle and the debt will try to come
[57:28] and cover it up and see anything so an
[57:30] ain't enough power in the church no more
[57:31] and then God don't do that not though
[57:34] he'll and God don't save any sense
[57:35] creepers in but there is a power here
[57:38] and that word a searching for that
[57:41] virgin to compose and that word will
[57:43] reunite with that body and there will be
[57:47] a bride without spot without wrinkle
[57:49] there is a little return of the Lord
[57:52] Jesus he promised he would I don't care
[57:55] how don't you get hallelujah
[57:59] I don't care how many Devils coming to
[58:01] this room I don't care how many Devils
[58:03] of depression and anxiety and fear want
[58:06] to filtrate this body or filtrate this
[58:08] round there's a wire that's been smoked
[58:11] and he can't do nothing you don't come
[58:13] too late devil because there's a bride

[59:40] air-raid Germans were going to bomb the
[59:42] factory and and they they got ready and
[59:45] they hunker down they watched as just
[59:47] almost seemed like hundreds of German
[59:49] planes went right over right over their
[59:51] factory and they knew that was coming
[59:53] for them they they had so you know I
[59:56] already had knowledge of it in fact
[59:58] broken the codes or whatever and know

[1:00:05] had actually flew over there because
[1:00:07] they flew over the top of it and they
[1:00:09] didn't bomb there they bombed about
[1:00:11] three or four miles or ten miles down
[1:00:14] somewhere else and they totally missed
[1:00:16] and the guy who was one of the pilots
[1:00:18] said you know he said we didn't know

[1:06:15] was spoke and he told Abraham you're

[1:06:44] bit after that that a king of a nation

[1:15:52] hallelujah it'll change a man that's
[1:15:57] what God can do hallelujah supernatural
[1:16:02] God does not change his nature to fit
[1:16:05] people's nature come on somebody you
[1:16:09] know first sermon I ever preached I had
[1:16:12] I guess I put it mine
[1:16:13] I searched first sermon ever preached
[1:16:16] was a lot a goat show of all things we
[1:16:22] had a in Shreveport Louisiana and they
[1:16:23] won't ask dad actually to speak on a
[1:16:26] Sunday morning for they'd only have a
[1:16:28] little devotion and he said well I have
[1:16:31] a church he said but my son he he'll
[1:16:34] speak I went well thanks dad
[1:16:37] what am I gonna speak on these all don't
[1:16:40] worry about it come and I'm all nervous
[1:16:41] and tore up well I get up there and I
[1:16:45] begin to think you know in the goat
[1:16:47] world there's something called a
[1:16:48] scorecard and it's written there you
[1:16:52] know what a goat you know maybe what a
[1:16:54] perfect goat would be and it's so many
[1:16:57] points are given to stature and
[1:17:00] confirmations and all kinds of things
[1:17:02] and it breaks it down in other little
[1:17:04] points and so as you show your animal
[1:17:07] judge in his mind is
[1:17:08] adding this animals points up and then
[1:17:10] theoretically he supposed to take those
[1:17:12] points and then place the animal
[1:17:14] according to what he's added up in his
[1:17:15] mind so this goat is 95 out of 100 and
[1:17:18] he goes first and on down and on down
[1:17:20] and so I was talking about the scorecard
[1:17:23] and I said you know I said the problem
[1:17:25] with the scorecard it's supposed to be
[1:17:26] the absolute I said but many breeders
[1:17:29] want to take the scorecard and change it
[1:17:31] to match their goat instead of taking a
[1:17:35] goat and trying to breed certain
[1:17:37] characteristics to where it matches the
[1:17:40] scorecard and I said the Bible is the
[1:17:42] same way people want to change the Bible
[1:17:46] well God don't teach that more and more
[1:17:48] that ain't the same no more you know
[1:17:50] that ain't right that's our church don't
[1:17:52] believe that what does it matter what
[1:17:54] your church believes well the preacher
[1:17:57] don't believe what does it matter what a
[1:17:58] preacher fits in the Bible it's in the
[1:18:00] Bible it's our absolute we got to have
[1:18:03] an absolute we got to have a hit I'm
[1:18:06] thankful that the word that we believed
[1:18:08] didn't have to have a new Bible that had
[1:18:09] to be written but we took the King James
[1:18:12] Version brother Brown took it and he
[1:18:14] made it lil it came alive hey man amen
[1:18:19] and then higher our ambition is not to
[1:18:21] take the word and change it to match
[1:18:23] what we believe because listen if you
[1:18:26] leave the scriptures you leave the
[1:18:28] message this message is not met if it
[1:18:35] ain't in the scriptures it's not message
[1:18:38] Amen so this Bible is our absolute so
[1:18:42] supernatural God does not change his
[1:18:45] nature to fit a person's nature people
[1:18:50] has to change their nature to fit God's
[1:18:52] supernatural plan and wise people cry
[1:18:56] who is this it's God in the midst of its
[1:18:59] people they don't understand that God
[1:19:01] will never come to your level you've got
[1:19:03] to come to his
[1:19:05] level God not come to meet you
[1:19:08] requirement you've got to meet God's
[1:19:10] requirement and then when that
[1:19:12] requirement is met upon the promise God
[1:19:14] made to redeem the people if that
[1:19:16] requirement has been met your entire
[1:19:19] being changes your entire being changes
[1:19:24] your thinking changes your habit changes
[1:19:26] everything about you changes your desire
[1:19:28] changes your living changes your ever
[1:19:30] everything changes because it's not your
[1:19:34] nature no more it's not your life no
[1:19:36] more it's a life of Christ living on the
[1:19:39] inside but people are afraid of the new
[1:19:44] birth but you know what new birth it's a
[1:19:48] mess I don't care where it's at it can
[1:19:50] be in a pigpen cows table in a pink
[1:19:52] decorated hospital room it's still a
[1:19:54] mess a birth when it takes place it's a
[1:19:57] mess new birth is the same it'll make
[1:20:00] you do things you didn't think you would
[1:20:02] do it'll make you cry boohoo rub around
[1:20:08] on the altar no matter what you do I'll
[1:20:10] never ask God to try to bring a new
[1:20:13] birth to my level I want to meet God's
[1:20:16] level of the new birth and receive it
[1:20:18] listen I think the time to water down
[1:20:21] the Christian walk people have watered
[1:20:25] it down to such a point that men can
[1:20:28] live in pornography and live and all
[1:20:30] kind of sexual sins and still have the
[1:20:32] Holy Ghost what that ain't that a that's
[1:20:35] somebody taking their level or God's
[1:20:39] level and trying to bring it down to
[1:20:40] their level God's not he don't operate
[1:20:42] like that he takes you and brings you to
[1:20:45] his level the new birth changes the man
[1:20:53] it changes a woman it changes their
[1:20:55] desire it changes their atmosphere it
[1:20:58] changes their appetites it really
[1:21:00] wrestle with God until the blessing
[1:21:02] comes you say well I'll dance in the
[1:21:08] spirit I spoke with tongues but look and
[1:21:10] see if something may not be right we'll
[1:21:14] get a weed growing now on to you got to
[1:21:16] get from this weed now to a week
[1:21:19] humble sweet with the word obedient
[1:21:21] obedient to the word lest the Holy
[1:21:24] Spirit come in and let God change you
[1:21:30] you can see a type of this change in the
[1:21:33] tadpole tadpole was born as looking like
[1:21:36] a little catfish or something just a
[1:21:38] little thing with a little tail on the
[1:21:40] swimmer swimming in a mud hole and you
[1:21:42] can watch the change as it begins to
[1:21:44] take place it begins to come up to the
[1:21:46] top of that water and it begins to take
[1:21:48] a little sip and it goes back down and
[1:21:51] it comes back up and it takes a little
[1:21:54] bigger silt and it goes back down and it
[1:21:56] comes back up and it takes a bigger silt
[1:21:58] and all of a sudden that atmosphere of
[1:22:00] that other world begins to do changes in
[1:22:02] his life and all of a sudden little legs
[1:22:04] pop out of it and the tail falls off and
[1:22:07] that world pool gets greater than the
[1:22:09] world that it was born in hallelujah
[1:22:12] amen I believe it we may all come to
[1:22:15] that moment our life what would come
[1:22:16] into the house of God would get a little
[1:22:18] sip of that atmosphere we get a little
[1:22:20] simpler Spirit of God moving and it
[1:22:23] begin to pull and they begin to whoo and
[1:22:25] they begin to draw until that world got
[1:22:27] greater than the world that we was born
[1:22:29] in hallelujah that's when you know what
[1:22:33] young man's been changed or young
[1:22:34] woman's been changed that the world they
[1:22:36] was born in has lost its power you can
[1:22:42] see it also in a butterfly as it comes a
[1:22:44] little ugly caterpillar and we're just
[1:22:46] creeping along most of you smashed him
[1:22:48] with your foot oh look the thing and it
[1:22:50] just sits over there and begins to eat
[1:22:52] begins they eat and begins they and
[1:22:54] something begins to change but you would
[1:22:57] say it was beginning to sing a song I'm
[1:22:59] wrapped up I'm tied up I'm tangled up in
[1:23:01] Jesus and it builds itself a little walk
[1:23:04] occurred and it's sitting there and it's
[1:23:06] eating and it's eating and it's eating
[1:23:08] something that's happening something is
[1:23:11] popping out and the next thing you know
[1:23:13] that ugly creature has changed to a
[1:23:15] butterfly hallelujah
[1:23:19] you know the change God has rolled in
[1:23:21] your life but I want you to understand
[1:23:23] God has done even greater amen because a
[1:23:25] frog can go back to the same waters amen
[1:23:28] amen a butterfly will go back down into
[1:23:31] the same and meet you know laying on the
[1:23:33] same leaves but God has done something
[1:23:35] excuse me not something greater
[1:23:38] he has taken you from a tadpole and
[1:23:41] change you into a butterfly he's totally
[1:23:46] changed your heart when you receive the
[1:23:48] Holy Ghost you're no longer the same
[1:23:51] your characteristics has changed
[1:23:53] everything about you is saying God has
[1:23:56] worked a miracle in here hallelujah and
[1:24:00] he's still a miracle working God I've
[1:24:05] seen him just this weekend come down and
[1:24:07] change a little girl it was so bound by
[1:24:09] fear and you when we went to pray for
[1:24:11] her she began to scream just sort of
[1:24:13] blood-curdling scream and begin to pull
[1:24:15] away from us minister but by the power
[1:24:18] the power of transformation we begin to
[1:24:22] call upon that thing and rebuke that
[1:24:23] spirit of fear and it left her he still
[1:24:28] got that power he still sets free the
[1:24:32] druggies he still sets free the drugs
[1:24:34] and the alcohol of you he and all the
[1:24:36] tobacco in the world once you get enough
[1:24:39] of that atmosphere you don't ever want
[1:24:41] to go back to that again so I brother
[1:24:46] band I'm talking about the pig he said
[1:24:48] you can take a pig and you can clean him
[1:24:50] up and you can wash him up you say put
[1:24:52] some lambskin on them so ain't that a
[1:24:54] beautiful lamb he said but there's still
[1:24:55] a nature inside of that it's still a pig
[1:24:58] he said if you can ever change that on
[1:25:01] the inside to be the nature of a lamb
[1:25:03] then you don't ever have to worry about
[1:25:06] that pig going back there again hello
[1:25:10] somebody hey man that's why we want our
[1:25:13] young people to have more than just a
