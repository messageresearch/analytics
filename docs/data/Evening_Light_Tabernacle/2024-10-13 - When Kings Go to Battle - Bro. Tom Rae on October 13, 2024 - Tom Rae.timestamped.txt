[48:14] on in the gospel of Christ I'm not
[48:17] ashamed of this gospel I believe it is
[48:20] the power of God and his
[48:22] salvation we had a prayer line last
[48:24] night because we are a people is called
[48:27] to fulfill the Great
[48:30] Commission we happen to believe all the
[48:33] word not part of it we believe in the
[48:36] open book we believe the seals have been
[48:40] taken off the Mysteries revealed we
[48:42] believe in the coming of Christ not just
[48:45] the meeting in the air but the word
[48:48] coming yes sir amen we have received
[48:50] Christ coming in the form of a
[48:54] message however there's got to be a
[48:56] people that reads the book and
[48:58] prophesies again that means that the
[49:01] word the message brought must take on
[49:05] flesh so we not only believe he's here
[49:08] in the form of his word we believe he's
[49:11] here in the form of his
[49:12] bride so he's here this morning Amen in
[49:16] the form of his bride and yeah we
[49:19] believe in the Grim coming again in the
[49:21] meeting in the air that's what Believers
[49:24] believe we believe in a literal Lord
[49:26] Jesus who's coming again we're going to
[49:29] be changed and meet him in the air but
[49:32] right now here's where he's at you want
[49:34] to know where he's at he's right here
[49:37] he's dwelling in his people amen
[49:40] producing Overcomers in this
[49:43] age you ask where is he well I just want
[49:46] to say he's not just in some
[49:49] theology but he's the word made flesh in
[49:53] Bride form so he's here in a people
[49:56] that'll do the same works that he did
[50:00] and we have a full course
[50:02] menu for all the Seven Seals are open
[50:06] therefore we believe in miracles because
[50:09] it's in the book therefore we believe in
[50:11] healing signs wonders because it's in
[50:14] the book certainly we believe all the
[50:17] Mysteries have concerning the bride of
[50:20] Christ have been revealed cuz it's in
[50:22] the book we Rejoice over those truths
[50:26] and yet we believe in every gift that
[50:28] God has because it's in the book
[50:32] therefore we will finish the Great
[50:35] Commission we will preach we will
[50:38] demonstrate the gospel we will lay hands
[50:40] on the sick we will cast out Devils we
[50:43] will speak with new
[50:45] tongues and if we lay hands on the sick
[50:48] they shall
[50:49] recover brother brandham tells us in the
[50:52] message turn on the light he said today
[50:54] we find people with somewhere what like
[50:57] in that day they're trying to live in a
[50:59] glare the church should ripen as a wheat
[51:02] ripens that man shall not live but by
[51:05] bread alone but by every word of God the
[51:09] bread of life not just parts of the word
[51:11] every word of God every age just don't
[51:14] stay there and eat beans and potatoes
[51:16] all the time there's other things go
[51:17] with it as we go in this full course of
[51:21] God's great dinner that's set before his
[51:24] people the power of the Holy Ghost
[51:25] rejoicing of it the power and the spirit
[51:28] that has been given the works that I do
[51:30] shall you do also because I live you
[51:33] shall live also the promises Jesus made
[51:37] to his
[51:38] church so we identified this morning
[51:41] with the gospel we're not ashamed
[51:44] of we identify as a book of Acts
[51:48] church we are continuation of that book
[51:52] where they went down in the ground amen
[51:56] down to up through Luther Wesley up to
[51:59] isua street now it's back to grain again
[52:03] what was planted there in the beginning
[52:06] is now here on the scene again we have a
[52:09] different Destiny they had a Destiny for
[52:12] the ground to go down into death bring
[52:15] forth more because if the if the corn
[52:18] eat just abides there it will abide
[52:21] alone but if it's planted it'll bring
[52:23] forth many and so we're here now in the
[52:26] very fulfillment of the scripture where
[52:30] what was there at the beginning the
[52:32] bride that was there at the beginning we
[52:34] are now come back to that very same spot
[52:37] to continue the book of Acts you say
[52:41] brother Tim book of Acts what are you
[52:44] talking about we're talking about the
[52:45] acts of the holy
[52:47] spirit amen it's not a it's not a
[52:50] different book of Acts it's not a new
[52:52] book of Acts it's the same Holy Ghost
[52:55] working in the same way in the same
[52:57] manner doing the same things here Among
[53:01] Us the same yesterday today and forever
[53:04] as brother bradam told us and the Mighty
[53:06] God in veiled before us said I was with
[53:10] John the Baptist before them critics I
[53:12] seen the spirit of God descending I
[53:15] heard the voice of God say this is my
[53:17] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[53:19] in I was sure identified with him I was
[53:23] identified there at the grave of Lazarus
[53:26] when he raised up Lazarus I was
[53:28] identified the woman at the well when he
[53:30] told her her sins I surely was
[53:34] identified with him in his death and I
[53:37] was identified on the first Easter I
[53:40] raised with him from Death I I'm
[53:43] identified with him in his death I was
[53:45] with the 120 in the upper room have you
[53:49] been there have you had your own
[53:51] experience I was identified up there
[53:54] with them I feel religious he says oh my
[53:57] I was identified there I I'm one of them
[54:00] I I got the same experience they had I
[54:04] was there when it happened to be a true
[54:06] Christian I witnessed the mighty Russian
[54:09] wind coming I witnessed that I felt the
[54:12] power of God as it shook I was with them
[54:15] that spoke with in tongues I felt the
[54:18] anointing come in there I was with them
[54:21] I was identified with them when the Holy
[54:23] Ghost began to speak through tongues
[54:25] with them I was was with Peter before
[54:27] the critics in Acts 2 when he preached
[54:29] the great sermon that he did and I was
[54:32] identified with him and he said in Acts
[54:34] for when they assembled together I was
[54:36] with them when the building shook you
[54:39] say well brother Tim you know I've had
[54:41] that experience I just say you can have
[54:44] it
[54:45] again Amen in Acts 4 here it came again
[54:49] when they got again began to praise God
[54:51] and got in one Accord believing the word
[54:54] what the house was Chuck with the power
[54:56] God Amen you can have it over and over
[55:00] again so he says I was with John on the
[55:04] aisle of patmas Seena second coming I
[55:07] was with Luther in the Reformation
[55:10] Wesley and he said I'm here
[55:13] tonight identified with the same kind of
[55:16] people with the same kind of an
[55:18] experience I must be to be a Christian I
[55:23] must stay identified where the word of
[55:25] God is being manifested
[55:27] I'm
[55:28] identified with a group that feels the
[55:31] spirit of God I'm identified with that
[55:34] group that knows he's unveiled that
[55:37] knows he's the same yesterday today and
[55:39] forever that this is not a
[55:41] fanaticism that Jesus Christ the same
[55:44] yesterday today and forever I'm
[55:46] identified with that group yet they're
[55:48] called a bunch of Heretics yet a bunch
[55:50] of fanaticism on account of the word of
[55:53] God so I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of
[55:56] Jesus Christ for it is the power of God
[55:59] into salvation and I'm one I'm with them

[1:15:23] love brother Timothy who who has been a
[1:15:25] part of and they come up and theyve
[1:15:27] ministered to our young men and our
[1:15:30] church phenomenal
[1:15:33] men
[1:15:35] Michael they' just been outstanding you
[1:15:38] know I was brother Tim I think you said
[1:15:39] we we're driving H if something happens
[1:15:42] to me the church is going to go on yes
[1:15:46] sir yes sir brother Derek it's going on
[1:15:49] you know you see different Works where
[1:15:51] they you know they have a certain person
[1:15:54] and they're there's nothing there and
[1:15:56] there's many churches around the world
[1:15:57] right now without pastors but I believe
[1:16:00] that in the vision of raising young men
[1:16:03] up and preach this gospel and listen to
[1:16:08] listen to me these men are eclipsing us
[1:16:11] well I say
[1:16:14] me the student has eclipsed the
[1:16:17] teachers that's me
[1:16:21] not but I love it I not intimidated by
[1:16:26] it because everybody has to be who they
[1:16:30] are and that's the wonderful part of
[1:16:33] resting in Christ you are what you are
[1:16:36] and you don't have to try and be anybody
[1:16:41] else sorry for the Preamble but I have
[1:16:44] to quiet my heart
[1:16:48] my would you mind if you would stand and
[1:16:50] we'll take our
[1:16:53] Bibles you know it's always dangerous
[1:16:55] after you preach and then every brother
[1:16:57] preaches after Michael and brother Ron I
[1:17:00] said they didn't leave anything for
[1:17:03] me then brother Ron has to do a rain

[1:17:19] his nose no it's amazing to me it's
[1:17:22] amazing and you should be as a people
[1:17:25] buil that men of God can get into a
[1:17:28] channel and it's for you it's not for us
[1:17:31] the gifts are never for ourselves the
[1:17:34] gift is for the
[1:17:35] body and you should have such a rest and
[1:17:38] glorify God that men of God can just get
[1:17:41] in a
[1:17:43] channel and the word of God can feed you
[1:17:46] am so I'd like to preach a little
[1:17:48] subject on it it's a time when the Kings
[1:17:53] go to war amen

[1:18:35] faithful witness and the first begotten
[1:18:38] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[1:18:41] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[1:18:46] washed us from our sins in his own
[1:18:49] blood and hath made
[1:18:52] us can we read this together please and

[1:19:41] and it came to pass that after the year
[1:19:43] was expired at the time when kings go
[1:19:45] forth to battle that David sent joab and
[1:19:51] his servants unto him and all Israel and
[1:19:54] they

[1:20:39] battle and it came to pass after the
[1:20:43] year was
[1:20:44] expired at the time when kings go forth
[1:20:48] if you look it up it says that the the
[1:20:51] Kings when they went to battle would go
[1:20:53] at a certain time of year
[1:20:55] year they would go either in the spring
[1:20:57] when it when it was still the ground was
[1:20:59] still hard and the Chariots wouldn't get
[1:21:01] bogged down the horses would run and
[1:21:04] they had a purpose they had a purpose
[1:21:07] and I trust you came to these meetings
[1:21:09] with a purpose that you said I'm going
[1:21:12] there not just to hear men preach but
[1:21:14] I'm going to support what they preach
[1:21:16] and I'm going to put an amen behind them
[1:21:19] and I'm going to deal with that demon
[1:21:21] that has bothered me

[1:21:27] Hall I feel we need to put some gloves
[1:21:29] on
[1:21:30] now and do some
[1:21:32] battle not just to leave it to last
[1:21:35] night but get up this morning and say
[1:21:37] Satan you are
[1:21:40] defeated never to bother me
[1:21:43] again amen I want to say to you Saints

[1:22:50] before I got saved I'm going to quit
[1:22:52] this filthy habit it's a filthy habit
[1:22:56] it's a
[1:22:57] demon and I would throw it out the
[1:23:00] window as I was driving down the road
[1:23:02] but I would count the fence
[1:23:06] post you know and that's a lot of times
[1:23:09] we come to church I want to get
[1:23:11] delivered
[1:23:12] but no butts Satan you're
[1:23:21] crushed no butts no fence folks
[1:23:25] no looking back no going back I can't go

[1:23:32] Satan wants to give you this
[1:23:34] [Applause]
[1:23:39] morning it is
[1:23:42] indeed no questions about it that's
[1:23:45] right no questions about it that's right
[1:23:54] you know a lot of times we appease the
[1:23:59] enemy rather than do battle with the
[1:24:03] Enemy you know and I've dealt with as it
[1:24:07] been I'm sure these men of God have much
[1:24:09] more than I may
[1:24:11] be but you would you can have deal with
[1:24:13] a homosexual demon you can deal with a
[1:24:17] demon
[1:24:18] demon a frothy demon frothy man I dealt
[1:24:22] with one one year guy was foing at the
[1:24:25] mouth foaming at the mouth and he come
[1:24:28] running towards the church and I stepped
[1:24:30] outside and I said you're not going to
[1:24:32] this church and he says I'm going to
[1:24:34] tear you apart spitting and sputtering
[1:24:37] and foaming and everything I remember a
[1:24:40] thing brother Bisal said a long time ago
[1:24:41] he says the reason people don't get
[1:24:43] delivered is because they love that
[1:24:45] [Applause]
[1:24:48] demon and so I saidou not coming here
[1:24:51] and I was just a young deacon at the
[1:24:53] time and and uh I was praying for you
[1:24:56] deacons by the way the other night you
[1:24:59] never get into a service you're always
[1:25:01] serving the people but may the Holy
[1:25:03] Spirit just calm everybody down and may
[1:25:05] the deacons get some from the word so he
[1:25:09] comes running around the corner he's fro
[1:25:11] at his mouth and and I'm looking at him
[1:25:13] and he says I'm going in there I said no
[1:25:16] you're
[1:25:16] not no you're not he said I'm going to
[1:25:19] tear you from limb to limb I said no
[1:25:21] you're not and he gets back his f fist
[1:25:24] like this and he's ready to plow me and
[1:25:26] I only thing that I could say is
[1:25:28] Satan I bind
[1:25:31] you come on Satan I bind you and that
[1:25:37] fellow turned around about three or four
[1:25:38] times and split the other direction and
[1:25:41] I said to myself it
[1:25:46] works come on it works what happened
[1:25:51] last night works pray for your family in
[1:25:55] Works receive the token it works let the
[1:25:59] Holy Spirit fall it
[1:26:03] works
[1:26:04] [Applause]
[1:26:09] glory
[1:26:12] god as Ministers of the Gospel we don't
[1:26:16] just want a one-time
[1:26:18] thing we don't want to just see that
[1:26:20] thing go and you go back home and it
[1:26:22] comes back again I want you to keep that
[1:26:25] devil on the run I want to see these
[1:26:27] young men actually stand in the word say
[1:26:29] Satan you can't have
[1:26:33] me God's got a work for me to
[1:26:47] do I've made my
[1:26:50] decision and I can't go back for a sub
[1:26:55] title Kings go to war and I can't go
[1:27:03] back there's a lot of turn
[1:27:07] coats there's a lot of people that come
[1:27:12] for a blessing Oh Come To Be Touched but
[1:27:16] after a while all they're living on is
[1:27:20] emotion I don't mind emotion but when
[1:27:23] God is behind the
[1:27:25] emotion you will never be the
[1:27:28] same and I find out that more people
[1:27:31] that preach either against it is that
[1:27:33] they don't have
[1:27:34] any so they got to they got to prop
[1:27:37] themselves
[1:27:38] up but Saints if God says it in the word
[1:27:41] I'm going to have a joy
[1:27:43] unspeakable I'm going to take it if he
[1:27:46] said I'm going to have Victory I'll take
[1:27:49] it if his word is open I'll take it

[1:30:48] and never realized and this is another
[1:30:50] subject we can preach on later but
[1:30:52] didn't realize that his daughter
[1:30:56] I I want you to hear this point he
[1:31:00] didn't realize he thought maybe I don't
[1:31:01] know what's going to come out the tent
[1:31:02] chicken I don't know a lamb I don't know
[1:31:05] I don't know what people have in their
[1:31:08] tents but he his daughter came
[1:31:13] out and this is what he said I have
[1:31:17] opened my
[1:31:19] mouth in a
[1:31:21] vow he vowed it to the Lord yeah and he
[1:31:25] opened his mouth and he said to the Lord
[1:31:29] I cannot go
[1:31:31] back and if he could sacrifice the
[1:31:34] dearest thing to him surely you have
[1:31:38] sacrificed many things last night I want
[1:31:41] you to say I canot go
[1:31:47] back can't go back I can't be what I was
[1:31:50] last night I'm a changed person I got
[1:31:54] delivered I'm set
[1:31:56] [Applause]
[1:32:00] free AOW in the Bible if vow and O are
[1:32:05] treated with profound
[1:32:12] seriousness contracts promises and
[1:32:16] Covenants before God are a very serious
[1:32:22] matter you've given your life to
[1:32:25] Christ I can't go
[1:32:28] back I've been Justified
[1:32:31] Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost I
[1:32:33] can't go back are you going to have
[1:32:36] battles yes you are but you're not just
[1:32:39] an ordinary person you're a king and
[1:32:43] you're a priest and we got praise in our
[1:32:47] lips amen and we're
[1:32:50] Kings I heard about that King the other
[1:32:53] night find me
[1:32:55] somebody amen can ask something worthy
[1:32:59] of a king I thought the continuity in
[1:33:03] the word is just amazing what is the
[1:33:06] holy spirit trying to do within our
[1:33:17] lives Peter said to whom can we go
[1:33:21] disciples left and people have left and
[1:33:23] people will go but those that are truly
[1:33:26] born again see genes of God they are now
[1:33:30] a prisoner to the Revelation that God

[1:34:36] compelling us it's a pulsation in our
[1:34:40] heart that says stay with

[1:35:16] babies and maybe you're just married and

[1:35:28] that sisters I'm talking to you you got
[1:35:32] a
[1:35:33] husband oh come
[1:35:35] on I better preach over here
[1:35:38] then maybe a little bit latter on the
[1:35:40] meter here sisters you have
[1:35:45] husbands there you go they one
[1:35:50] notop we have husbands I have a wife I
[1:35:53] adore her
[1:35:54] I adore her we have children I adore
[1:35:57] them that's their responsibility they're
[1:36:00] the Fifth
[1:36:02] Gospel don't water it down by looking at
[1:36:05] the things that are trinkets that are
[1:36:06] around
[1:36:10] you I got to have this I got to have
[1:36:12] that be
[1:36:13] content in what the Lord's given you
[1:36:17] we're Kings we're Queens we're priests
[1:36:21] and now those things are just don't
[1:36:22] matter
[1:36:24] I saw the I don't know if you remember
[1:36:26] there was a a a big earthquake and big
[1:36:28] tidle wave in uh at
[1:36:30] Fukushima in Japan beautiful homes and I
[1:36:36] saw those water waves they came in they
[1:36:38] swept hold Villages beautiful homes and
[1:36:41] I started to think what are in those
[1:36:42] beautiful homes I'm sure they saved up
[1:36:45] and got beautiful pictures beautiful
[1:36:48] things scripture talks about
[1:36:51] stuff and we shrimp and we save and we
[1:36:54] do this and we do that but in a moment
[1:36:58] it can be taken
[1:36:59] away so we have to hold these things
[1:37:02] that we have very
[1:37:05] Loosely don't set your heart for those
[1:37:08] things set your heart for the things of
[1:37:10] God because we can't go back to what Leo
[1:37:13] deia likes that's right increased with
[1:37:19] Goods sir if God blesses you praise the
[1:37:22] Lord give him all the the glory if you
[1:37:25] don't have anything I Paul says I know

[1:38:42] a young teenage girl to leave
[1:38:45] that it takes something within that's
[1:38:48] stronger than the natural
[1:38:51] man she walked out out of there she came

[1:38:57] preachers they found out where Kathy was
[1:38:59] at and they brought a because in the

[1:41:09] position sorry I'm just being myself
[1:41:15] temp hey you can be
[1:41:18] removed that's not a permanent
[1:41:21] post you come prayed
[1:41:25] up you come cherishing the gift that God
[1:41:29] gave
[1:41:30] you Satan could have used that
[1:41:33] gift and used it in the world but God
[1:41:36] said you're
[1:41:42] mine I'll never go back I can't do that
[1:41:46] I hate that music
[1:41:54] I I'm sorry but I'm this way at home I
[1:41:57] guess aren't I
[1:42:01] Sam come on Sam give me an
[1:42:03] [Laughter]
[1:42:05] amen
[1:42:08] Joel Michael yes sir there you go
[1:42:15] amen what a time we're living in when
[1:42:19] all hell is against this Revelation MH
[1:42:22] all hell Christ of mystery God revealed
[1:42:25] all hell is against this Revelation but
[1:42:28] let me give you a a great
[1:42:31] exhortation he can't have
[1:42:34] [Applause]
[1:42:37] youall that's why he he starts ending
[1:42:39] now Christ is Mystery of God revealed
[1:42:42] Christ is the
[1:42:44] mystery of God revealed in you you got
[1:42:48] to figure out who you use
[1:42:51] is I'm a you yeah that's right and so
[1:42:55] then he goes on to say now we are the
[1:42:58] sons of God not we'll be but now so
[1:43:03] listen we don't want to lower that when
[1:43:06] a prophet preached that in 1963 after
[1:43:09] the opening of the seals because that
[1:43:11] was part of the mystery that was being
[1:43:13] revealed under the
[1:43:16] seals
[1:43:19] right so we read on Friday night or
[1:43:24] Thursday
[1:43:25] night Jesus had to believe who he
[1:43:30] was you have to believe who you
[1:43:34] are so now we're moving it a notch at a
[1:43:37] time a notch at a time because it's one
[1:43:40] thing to say to these wonderful men that
[1:43:43] we just cherish the gift of God within
[1:43:46] their
[1:43:47] lives but it's not just for
[1:43:49] them it's for you it's for you we're not
[1:43:53] Catholics
[1:43:54] here oh
[1:43:57] father bless
[1:44:00] me we left that behind and we won't go
[1:44:05] back but we'll go back to be Sons and
[1:44:08] Daughters of God realizing who we are in
[1:44:12] this day that's right and the Kings at a
[1:44:15] time at this Junction are going out to
[1:44:18] battle
[1:44:27] but the Bram says
[1:44:29] this he goes
[1:44:32] listen it can batter against you but it
[1:44:37] can't get
[1:44:38] you when Satan walked up to Eve and said
[1:44:41] you know the fruit's pleasant she
[1:44:44] stopped for a
[1:44:45] moment oh that's when she made her
[1:44:49] mistake she stopped for a moment when
[1:44:52] she stop for a moment and brother
[1:44:55] brandom you should hear it he said don't
[1:44:57] stop for
[1:44:59] nothing did you hear me don't stop for
[1:45:03] nothing add to your faith virtue virtue
[1:45:05] and they make a whole Doctrine to that
[1:45:08] the adding as we're fellowshipping the
[1:45:10] other day is not that you can add
[1:45:11] anything to your
[1:45:13] stature you can't Jesus said I'm
[1:45:17] 5'6 yes I as we said and they made fun
[1:45:21] of
[1:45:21] me one of my sons want to be 6'2 you
[1:45:25] can't add to your stature you are what
[1:45:27] you are but if you look at the word add
[1:45:30] in the Greek it says that add is to lay
[1:45:33] in the presence of the Sun and so that
[1:45:36] sun would bring out the life that's in
[1:45:38] the
[1:45:39] seed so the secret isn't that you add to
[1:45:42] it the secret is laying the presence
[1:45:44] that's right laying God lay in
[1:45:48] Christ
[1:45:50] amen ah but we're too busy brother
[1:45:55] did you vow a vow here some said Lord if
[1:45:58] you will deliver me of this I'll serve
[1:46:03] you stronger and harder than I've ever
[1:46:05] served you
[1:46:07] before maybe you said it maybe you
[1:46:09] didn't but if you vowed that vow or you
[1:46:12] promis that
[1:46:14] promise then you have to make a
[1:46:17] determination I cannot go back to what I
[1:46:20] was before the brothers laid hands on
[1:46:24] me and I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:46:27] really we'll just start digging now how
[1:46:30] many got delivered sir okay okay I'll
[1:46:34] even make it better than that stand up
[1:46:36] if you were
[1:46:41] delivered Isaiah God bless
[1:46:49] you God bless you
[1:46:53] amen this is nothing but the truth so
[1:46:57] now you've been delivered I'm a king and
[1:47:00] I will not go
[1:47:01] [Music]
[1:47:03] back
[1:47:05] Hallelujah so now we start to
[1:47:09] understand it came to
[1:47:12] pass after the year was expired so they
[1:47:16] said there either be in winter when the
[1:47:17] heart's ground or coming in the spring
[1:47:20] or fall when there's a harvest so they
[1:47:21] can feed their soldiers
[1:47:24] so it's it's planned you sit down and a
[1:47:26] as as Jesus said when a king decides to
[1:47:29] go to war he weighs
[1:47:33] out weighs it out that King's got 40,000
[1:47:37] men and we got 25,000 can we do it our
[1:47:41] men are mightier they're stronger God
[1:47:43] does not care for the
[1:47:45] number never has a never will be we can
[1:47:48] read in Chronicles we can read in in
[1:47:50] Genesis with Abraham they were out
[1:47:54] numbered but with God on your
[1:47:58] side if the scripture says greater is he
[1:48:00] that's
[1:48:02] in than he that's in the world and we
[1:48:05] realize that at that river Euphrates
[1:48:07] 200,000,000
[1:48:09] Supernatural demons just added added
[1:48:12] more thereafter brother Bri said only
[1:48:15] one thing you the bride so you say
[1:48:18] Where's God in my life you're
[1:48:21] here come come on come on you're here
[1:48:26] and Supernatural demons have been loosed
[1:48:28] on you and so you have been defeating
[1:48:32] Satan day after day after

[1:48:51] Ghost you're miserable yeah
[1:48:53] you're
[1:48:56] defeatable but once you get him and that
[1:49:00] word is living in you you're the one
[1:49:03] that conquers that
[1:49:05] devil amen you can't always go to the
[1:49:07] pastors you have to go to God

[1:52:54] heard you've heard wonderful preaching
[1:52:56] you're sitting under wonderful
[1:52:58] Ministries but are we becoming what we
[1:53:00] here or is this a service we're coming
[1:53:03] into and going out coming in you should
[1:53:07] be more charged coming here this morning
[1:53:09] than you were last night I saw you
[1:53:13] dancing amen I don't mind that I just

[1:53:22] forgive me I it's the move that's right
[1:53:26] Joel has the
[1:53:31] move huh but you know you say as
[1:53:34] Canadians are
[1:53:37] starchy
[1:53:38] huh that's good
[1:53:43] Tom man that's good Tom we're excited

[1:54:06] you should be able to do it in a slow or
[1:54:08] in a
[1:54:11] fast victory is mine Amazing Grace is
[1:54:15] mine it doesn't matter what song is
[1:54:17] singing rejoice and I say to you again
[1:54:20] this morning rejoice the king is in the
[1:54:28] town hallelujah king
[1:54:33] MDC King
[1:54:36] MDC after the
[1:54:39] battle mthc came on the
[1:54:42] scene come on and he had for
[1:54:46] Abraham Bread and Wine but that was a
[1:54:50] theophany
[1:54:52] so Abraham being a prophet saw God in
[1:54:55] morphe in a theophany so that you and I
[1:54:59] can know after the battle after last
[1:55:03] night King MDC is leading his people
[1:55:16] home thank you Lord
[1:55:20] hallelujah you know where the Devil
[1:55:22] Makes a
[1:55:24] mistake I'll tell you where he makes a
[1:55:26] mistake he took the wrong
[1:55:29] person
[1:55:32] yeah God promised Abraham look North
[1:55:36] look South yeah look east west east look
[1:55:41] that way all that's in
[1:55:46] yours so Abraham didn't move when Sodom
[1:55:49] and Gomorrah were getting rampaged
[1:55:52] didn't
[1:55:53] move but you know when he moved when
[1:55:57] Satan took something that was
[1:55:59] his come on I think we got to get
[1:56:03] moved uhhuh and he didn't just say in
[1:56:06] his neighborhood he went from Dan to
[1:56:11] Barba and he didn't just get lot he got
[1:56:14] everything 38 men versus four kingdoms
[1:56:19] that's God
[1:56:22] I want you to understand you're here
[1:56:25] because you're
[1:56:31] godsall Hallelujah now let me say this

[2:03:26] message
[2:03:27] all done out on the Saturday night I got
[2:03:31] up morning early praying and the Lord

[2:04:09] willingly comes to the Altar and he
[2:04:12] gives his life to

[2:16:20] said said in things that are to be the
[2:16:22] man of God the pastor will call certain
[2:16:24] men to come at a certain season and have
[2:16:27] them Minister the word because they know
[2:16:29] what their body needs and he types it to
[2:16:32] a woman being pregnant and have
[2:16:34] cantaloup or whatever it is the husband
[2:16:36] will do anything it can to see the need
[2:16:39] met within his wife cuz she's going to
[2:16:42] bring forth a child so a pastor has a
[2:16:45] church and he sees the body bringing
[2:16:47] forth Christ and so they have special

[2:25:54] impossible so now here's a son of elzar

[2:26:06] word but you know when you get a problem
[2:26:08] with a word just go look it up don't
[2:26:11] just glaze over it but look up the word
[2:26:16] they put dodo but in the Hebrew it's do
[2:26:20] do day and do Day means the son of the
[2:26:24] lovely
[2:26:26] one I love that I love that title I

[2:26:36] am I'm son of the lovely one and he's
[2:26:39] coming in plain
[2:26:41] [Applause]
[2:26:43] view so here is
[2:26:46] doe one of the three mighty men with
[2:26:48] David and he he defied the
[2:26:52] Philistines we're going to be closing so
[2:26:54] I want you to stay with me right now am
[2:26:57] man he defied the devil and I want you
[2:27:01] to end these meetings with defying
[2:27:07] Satan uh-huh amen he defied the
[2:27:11] Philistines that's what your Bible says
[2:27:14] he defied the
[2:27:16] Philistines amen son of do day the aites
[2:27:21] one of the three mighty men with David
[2:27:23] when they defied the Philistines that
[2:27:25] were gathered there to battle and the
[2:27:27] man of Israel were gone away and he
[2:27:31] arose now think about it the men of
[2:27:34] Israel had gone away but he arose oh
[2:27:38] yeah come on he arose and he smokee the
[2:27:43] Philistines until his hand was
[2:27:47] weary and his hand clav unto the
[2:27:52] sword I said that's what I want to do
[2:27:54] brother Tim that's what I want to do the
[2:27:57] king's
[2:27:59] sword has come in your
[2:28:01] generation it
[2:28:03] fits it fits and the Bible says the
[2:28:07] Israelites ran
[2:28:09] away but the son of do
[2:28:13] eleazer he fought with the sword in his
[2:28:16] hand and the Lord won a great victory
[2:28:19] that that day and then the people
[2:28:22] returned that's they wanted to Rejoice
[2:28:25] with him that had the victory that's
[2:28:33] miserable I want you all to
[2:28:35] Rejoice you've taken the sword this
[2:28:37] weekend you've taken it in your hand and
[2:28:40] that sword is n thee even in thy mouth
[2:28:43] it
[2:28:45] fits now perhaps elaser he grew tired
[2:28:51] but my Bible says that Gideon also grew
[2:28:55] tired the Bible says he was weary yet
[2:28:59] kept
[2:29:00] pursuing you might be
[2:29:03] weary but I want you to keep

[2:29:08] today I want you to keep pursuing get up
[2:29:11] in the morning have a little prayer read
[2:29:13] your Bible listen to one of the messages

[2:29:41] devil's taken away but if there was God
[2:29:43] they can't get taken
[2:29:45] away
[2:29:48] period so do day

[2:30:12] nobody he had a revelation of who he was
[2:30:14] under the
[2:30:16] kingship Kings go to battle he knew he's
[2:30:19] under the king David he knew King David
[2:30:21] was coming to his position and I know my
[2:30:24] word my God is coming to his position
[2:30:26] I'll fight like never before I'll take
[2:30:29] the sword of the word I'll cleave the

[2:30:57] good I'm right behind you he stood alone
[2:31:00] and I got to know I've been in
[2:31:03] places where I've stood
[2:31:07] alone and you're going to have to come
[2:31:09] to a place sometimes there's nobody
[2:31:11] around you but you've held the word of
[2:31:14] God in your hand and you can't let it go
[2:31:17] there was a fellow named D Dempster I
[2:31:19] think I think it was he was a pilot and
[2:31:21] he was flying and it was one of those
[2:31:23] Bush pilot planes and he was uh they
[2:31:26] heard a rattle in the back and he said
[2:31:27] to his copilot take the
[2:31:30] plane so he wanted to go back to the
[2:31:32] back of the at the plane and and find
[2:31:34] out what the noise was and when when he
[2:31:36] went there they hit a bump and he hit
[2:31:37] the uh lever on the door and out the
[2:31:39] door he
[2:31:41] goes so the co-pilot
[2:31:44] says to control tower to control tower
[2:31:47] we have an emergency our pilot just got
[2:31:49] blown out
[2:31:51] we'll need a helicopter to do a grid
[2:31:52] search for him he's somewhere in the and
[2:31:54] he gave the coordinates so he got down
[2:31:56] real quickly to the nearest airport and
[2:31:59] when they landed there was the pilot
[2:32:00] holding on to the
[2:32:08] stairs holding on to the stairs flying
[2:32:11] at 200 miles an
[2:32:15] hour and when he went to loose his hand
[2:32:18] it took them about half an hour to get
[2:32:20] his fingers off in the
[2:32:22] railing now that was a tight
[2:32:26] grip and the fellow said to him how did
[2:32:29] you hold on he saids the option wasn't
