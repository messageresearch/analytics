[1:06:04] laodicean church age
[1:06:07] and i pray oh god
[1:06:09] that we'll hear what the spirit says to
[1:06:11] the church

[1:06:37] wonderful name of the lord jesus christ
[1:06:40] amen brother jerome it's good to see you
[1:06:42] here this morning god bless you
[1:06:44] been through a battle with his health
[1:06:46] but

[1:06:48] first deacons he actually
[1:06:51] is um the the only one of our first
[1:06:54] deacons is still serves he's an honorary
[1:06:56] deacon now
[1:06:58] we appreciate brother jerome he's been a
[1:06:59] faithful servant
[1:07:01] amen been a human sister linda has been
[1:07:04] a blessing to our church
[1:07:06] through the years and the betts family
[1:07:08] we appreciate them all and amen good to
[1:07:11] see the chandler's is back there from
[1:07:13] the nelsons god bless you nice to have
[1:07:15] you in the service today and
[1:07:18] and you know i i thought about it the
[1:07:20] other day
[1:07:22] february the 1st 1970 52 years ago i
[1:07:26] preached my first sermon in a little
[1:07:28] blocker's chapel amen and
[1:07:30] you know i never knew where that sermon
[1:07:32] would take me to as a 15 year old boy
[1:07:34] preacher but we've been around the world
[1:07:37] and back a few times
[1:07:39] not preaching our own message god sent a
[1:07:41] message in this day
[1:07:43] and vindicated it and showed it was the
[1:07:46] truth
[1:07:47] we thank god for the seventh angel and
[1:07:49] his message
[1:07:50] we don't believe in any other message
[1:07:53] amen we believe that is to be the truth
[1:07:55] that it is the gospel of jesus christ
[1:07:58] not a new gospel
[1:07:59] but the very thing that jesus brought in
[1:08:02] and paul brought and peter brought we've
[1:08:05] been restored back to that and it's from
[1:08:08] that restoration that we have something
[1:08:10] to minister from otherwise we'd be lost
[1:08:13] in a sea of confusion today
[1:08:16] amen but god rich in mercy has
[1:08:19] has sent uh the evening light where he
[1:08:22] said in the evening time it shall be
[1:08:24] light so we thank god for the message
[1:08:27] god sent us let's go to john chapter 3
[1:08:30] and verse 1.
[1:08:32] i i've got
[1:08:33] lots of places to go today
[1:08:35] in the word
[1:08:36] and so um as you know we uh
[1:08:40] we discontinued our sunday night
[1:08:42] services and put two into one so we sing
[1:08:45] a little longer preach a little longer
[1:08:47] and
[1:08:47] you know if um you get weary and have to
[1:08:50] go well that's fine
[1:08:52] we'll just preach until
[1:08:54] the lord nudges us and said okay you got
[1:08:57] it
[1:08:57] amen
[1:08:59] i pray that you'll just enter in this
[1:09:01] morning
[1:09:02] amen let god speak to your heart john
[1:09:05] chapter 3 and verse 1 there was a man of
[1:09:07] the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of
[1:09:10] the jews the same came to jesus by night
[1:09:12] and said unto him rabbi we know that
[1:09:15] thou art a teacher come from god for no
[1:09:17] man can do these miracles
[1:09:19] that thou doest accept god be with him
[1:09:22] and jesus answered and said unto him
[1:09:25] verily verily i say unto thee
[1:09:28] except a man be born again he cannot see
[1:09:30] the kingdom of god
[1:09:32] nicodemus nicodemus said unto him
[1:09:35] how can a man be born when he is old can
[1:09:38] he enter the second time into his
[1:09:40] mother's womb and be born
[1:09:42] and jesus answered verily verily i say
[1:09:45] unto thee except a man be born of water
[1:09:48] and of the spirit he cannot enter
[1:09:51] into the kingdom of god
[1:09:53] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[1:09:56] that which is born of the spirit of
[1:09:58] spirit
[1:09:59] marvel not i
[1:10:00] said unto thee ye must be born again
[1:10:04] the wind bloweth where it lifts us and
[1:10:06] thou hears the sound thereof
[1:10:09] but cannot tell whence it cometh and
[1:10:12] whether it goeth so is everyone that is
[1:10:15] born of the spirit
[1:10:17] and then i'd like to turn over to first
[1:10:20] peter chapter 1 and verse 23 just one
[1:10:22] verse and then you can be seated
[1:10:25] being born again
[1:10:27] not of corruptible seed but of
[1:10:30] incorruptible
[1:10:32] by the word of god which liveth and
[1:10:34] abideth forever
[1:10:37] god bless you as you're seated and we're
[1:10:40] going to share with you a little
[1:10:41] quotation from the spoken word is
[1:10:43] original seed
[1:10:44] from where we will take our sermon text
[1:10:47] this morning
[1:10:49] and said as the end time prophecies will
[1:10:51] repeat i believe
[1:10:53] as the first forerunner came from the
[1:10:55] wilderness and cried behold the lamb of
[1:10:58] god
[1:10:59] the second forerunner will probably do
[1:11:01] the same by pointing the people
[1:11:04] to a word-born bride
[1:11:07] and the bride of christ will be pointed
[1:11:09] to the skies at the appearing of jesus
[1:11:11] scream and behold the lamb of god will
[1:11:13] come forth from his lips god help us to
[1:11:15] be ready for that near event
[1:11:19] and and then again in the spoken word's
[1:11:22] original seed
[1:11:23] he said all sons all of god's sons must
[1:11:26] be the same yes sir to be born of the
[1:11:29] word and the spirit brings us back to
[1:11:32] the spoken word again
[1:11:36] like in john 3 to be born of the water
[1:11:38] and the spirit what does it do
[1:11:40] then it brings you right back unto the
[1:11:43] place where you should have been
[1:11:46] at the beginning
[1:11:47] see that's the reason of christ's death
[1:11:50] to brings us back again to where
[1:11:52] sons of god
[1:11:54] so we're going to be speaking this
[1:11:56] morning taking my text from
[1:11:59] that statement brother branham was
[1:12:01] pressed to put up on his pen to write by
[1:12:04] the holy spirit where he said that
[1:12:07] the that the second forerunner will
[1:12:09] probably do the same by pointing the
[1:12:11] people to a word
[1:12:13] born bride
[1:12:15] so we're going to be speaking on a word
[1:12:18] born bride or a bride born of the word
[1:12:22] all right so there is to be a message
[1:12:26] that is
[1:12:27] that that comes in this day that we are
[1:12:29] to be born of the full word of god now
[1:12:32] the full birth could not come to the
[1:12:34] full word king
[1:12:36] because for example in luther's day they
[1:12:39] had a partial
[1:12:40] poor a revelation of the new birth it
[1:12:43] was not as it was in the book of acts
[1:12:46] where they received the holy ghost
[1:12:48] it was a portion as they were in their
[1:12:52] restoration and they were justified by
[1:12:54] faith
[1:12:55] but it was for that time the accepted
[1:12:58] way
[1:13:00] but then god would come along with
[1:13:02] another message or another further part
[1:13:04] of his word which would be
[1:13:06] sanctification
[1:13:07] and in sanctification there again would
[1:13:10] be another part that would be required
[1:13:13] to the new birth and that is to be
[1:13:15] justified
[1:13:16] and sanctified
[1:13:18] those old
[1:13:19] uh holiness people of the methodist age
[1:13:22] they shouted and rejoiced as they were
[1:13:25] sanctified by the holy ghost
[1:13:28] and the old habits of the world will be
[1:13:31] taken off and the priests without
[1:13:33] holiness shall no man see the lord but
[1:13:36] you know they did like everyone else has
[1:13:38] done they cabbage down on that and they
[1:13:41] went no further
[1:13:42] brother branham used that term cabbage
[1:13:44] down and they would go no further and
[1:13:47] they would make a denomination out of
[1:13:49] that
[1:13:49] they would set that this is all of it
[1:13:53] and god would move beyond that and he
[1:13:55] would in 1906 he would pour out his
[1:13:58] spirit some more
[1:13:59] and again now men and women would be
[1:14:03] baptized with the holy ghost in a
[1:14:06] and as it moved and and
[1:14:08] upon men's spirits and they rejoiced and
[1:14:12] they uh spoke in other tongues and did
[1:14:15] many many um manifestations of the
[1:14:18] spirit of god at that time and rejoiced
[1:14:21] as the lord would now show them again
[1:14:24] that there was a great
[1:14:27] um a great move of god and a furtherance
[1:14:30] even to the great new birth that they
[1:14:33] were experiencing
[1:14:35] now they would they would preach that
[1:14:37] you must be
[1:14:38] justified and sanctified and they were
[1:14:41] being filled with the spirit for that
[1:14:43] time they were they were actually in
[1:14:45] that moment of baptized into the body of
[1:14:48] gifts and they would manifest great
[1:14:51] gifts of the spirit but you see it was a
[1:14:53] partial word and with a partial word
[1:14:56] comes a parcel birth
[1:14:58] in the message the birth pains brother
[1:15:00] branham tells us that there is to be a
[1:15:03] new birth according to malachi 4.
[1:15:06] so again when the fullness of the word
[1:15:09] comes it brings us into the fullness of
[1:15:12] the new birth
[1:15:14] not just a an anointing upon us as the
[1:15:17] azusa people received
[1:15:20] but but now
[1:15:22] not just the spirit realm refreshed and
[1:15:26] and men shout or dance and and whatever
[1:15:29] but now it comes down into
[1:15:32] the very nature of man where the token
[1:15:36] the holy ghost is now applied not not a
[1:15:39] gift of the spirit
[1:15:41] but the spirit himself
[1:15:44] you see
[1:15:45] um it was
[1:15:46] the literal life of jesus christ
[1:15:49] returning back to the church and so with
[1:15:53] um
[1:15:54] there again it this brings us back to
[1:15:57] the place where we should have been at
[1:16:00] the beginning
[1:16:01] where that man fell away from god all
[1:16:04] the way back to from from genesis now i
[1:16:07] just like to go to james chapter 1 and
[1:16:10] verse 17 and he tells us that every good
[1:16:13] and perfect gift is from above and
[1:16:16] cometh down from the father of lights no
[1:16:18] to notice the words father of lights say
[1:16:22] that with me father of lights
[1:16:25] and with whom there is no bearableness
[1:16:28] neither shadow or turning and all of his
[1:16:31] own will begat here so he's a father and
[1:16:35] now out of his own will not the will of
[1:16:37] the flesh or that of man
[1:16:39] which comes by the sexual birth but the
[1:16:42] will of god
[1:16:43] amen and so he out of his own will he
[1:16:46] begat he us with the word of truth
[1:16:50] so again we are begotten of the word
[1:16:55] notice
[1:16:56] there with a message every message that
[1:16:58] has come down from in the restoration as
[1:17:01] it started back actually
[1:17:03] that was truly a reformation from the
[1:17:05] reformation forward every work of every
[1:17:08] work of grace came out of a message of
[1:17:11] truth
[1:17:13] now so again it would be that out of the
[1:17:16] word of truth out of his own will begat
[1:17:20] he us
[1:17:22] with the word of truth that we should be
[1:17:24] a kind of first fruits of his creatures
[1:17:29] now this this means of first fruits that
[1:17:32] uh a create a new creation
[1:17:35] a new species
[1:17:37] one that there hasn't been like
[1:17:39] you know in thousands of years
[1:17:42] because we've had all the way down from
[1:17:45] um from the book of acts till now we we
[1:17:49] saw a fallen away of the church and and
[1:17:52] there would be a hybrid church in hybrid
[1:17:54] members
[1:17:55] there was not the original seed
[1:17:58] that's why it would take a profit in
[1:18:00] this day to turn our hearts back
[1:18:02] to the original faith
[1:18:04] so that out of this word he would be get
[1:18:07] children
[1:18:09] amen sons and daughters of god and and
[1:18:12] for god then to be the father of lights
[1:18:15] there has to be then little lights
[1:18:18] little pillar of fires that are begotten
[1:18:21] out of him
[1:18:23] remember brother brown said the pillar
[1:18:24] fire has nothing to do with me
[1:18:27] he said you know every one of you have
[1:18:30] that pillar of fire it is it is your it
[1:18:34] is the lick of fire from the holy ghost
[1:18:36] that's what he did on the day of
[1:18:37] pentecost the father of lights came and
[1:18:41] from the pillar of fire came licks of
[1:18:44] fire and 120 were filled with the holy
[1:18:48] ghost so every son of god is a light of
[1:18:51] god
[1:18:52] they have a portion of that god together
[1:18:55] we we make up the body of christ
[1:18:58] collectively we may we are not
[1:19:00] individually the body but collectively
[1:19:03] we are the body
[1:19:05] amen so again for god to be the father
[1:19:08] of lights there had to be little lights
[1:19:09] little pillars of fire that's what
[1:19:11] brother branham said in the uh the
[1:19:13] messiah then when god was made flesh and
[1:19:16] became the messiah if we can yield
[1:19:19] ourselves to be anointed like he was
[1:19:22] we become messiah's little lights
[1:19:26] that's what the church is to be light
[1:19:28] little anointed ones that's god's church
[1:19:33] his standing light is the light of the
[1:19:35] messiah
[1:19:36] risen christ in his people the anointed
[1:19:40] ones caring for this light into all the
[1:19:43] church ages sometimes it goes almost
[1:19:45] completely out then it comes back again
[1:19:48] god's anointed when god's anointed a
[1:19:51] messianic church if messiah means the
[1:19:53] anointed one means the king then if the
[1:19:56] church is anointed by the messiah spirit
[1:19:58] it becomes a lesser but still the
[1:20:00] messiah because it has his life
[1:20:03] reflecting his power reflecting his
[1:20:06] glory reflecting his dominion so it is
[1:20:09] messiah all how it reflects him in his
[1:20:13] kingdom in his domain
[1:20:15] now that's why that we are we are not
[1:20:19] looking for a messiah
[1:20:22] and neither are we followers of some
[1:20:24] personality cult
[1:20:26] we see the messiah among us
[1:20:29] amen he has been made flesh in his
[1:20:32] people a word born bride
[1:20:36] the bride of christ who is a woman must
[1:20:38] have a passionate faith
[1:20:41] to bring forth his life
[1:20:43] amen the the his seed the life of christ
[1:20:46] now as the end time prophecies repeat
[1:20:49] then there must be a woman who unites
[1:20:53] with the word to bring forth christ
[1:20:56] again to reproduce him remember he is a
[1:21:00] father of lights
[1:21:02] amen and he must have a church through
[1:21:04] which he reproduces himself
[1:21:08] amen now in galatians 4 and 19 paul
[1:21:12] would tell us you know of his message
[1:21:15] and what what he
[1:21:17] wanted to see it do he said my little
[1:21:19] children of whom i travail at birth
[1:21:22] again until christ be formed in you so
[1:21:25] he tells us there the church under his
[1:21:29] ministry was travailing in birth to form
[1:21:33] christ in the church
[1:21:37] amen to bring forth a baby to bring
[1:21:39] forth a child and that child would be of
[1:21:42] the holy ghost
[1:21:44] amen like mary was overshadowed by the
[1:21:47] holy ghost there would be a people in
[1:21:49] whom would be a spoken word a children
[1:21:53] of the word
[1:21:54] children of the prophecy
[1:21:56] that would be manifested upon the earth
[1:21:59] now paul would tell us in ii corinthians
[1:22:01] 11 and 2
[1:22:03] about his jealousy and how he was trying
[1:22:06] to protect this woman and how that she
[1:22:09] must remain virtuous he said i'm jealous
[1:22:12] over you with a godly jealousy for i
[1:22:15] will espouse you to one husband
[1:22:18] now remember to to come from another
[1:22:20] husband would mean a hybrid child amen
[1:22:24] because it's not of the it's not at the
[1:22:27] covenant are you with me but he said
[1:22:29] i've espoused you to one husband that i
[1:22:32] might present you as a chaste virgin
[1:22:35] to christ but i fear now here's what his
[1:22:38] fear was that lest by any means as the
[1:22:41] serpent beguiled eve through his
[1:22:44] subtlety
[1:22:46] is so your mind should be corrupted from
[1:22:49] the simplicity that is in christ
[1:22:51] so that worm of your mind through whom
[1:22:54] to hook through which the seed has to
[1:22:57] descend through
[1:22:58] are you with me it has to be received in
[1:23:01] the mind taken into the heart
[1:23:03] and he said i'm afraid that your minds
[1:23:06] will be corrupted from the simplicity
[1:23:08] that is in christ that you will have a
[1:23:10] defiled wound
[1:23:12] now this would happen to the church
[1:23:15] because in the book of revelation it
[1:23:16] shows her as a
[1:23:18] and her daughters that come out of her
[1:23:20] just like her because her morals are
[1:23:22] passed on to her offspring
[1:23:24] is that right so as the end time
[1:23:27] prophecies repeat now let's let's go
[1:23:30] back in our thinking just for a moment
[1:23:32] unto the book of genesis
[1:23:35] because in the book of genesis it
[1:23:37] decreed every seed was to bring forth of
[1:23:41] its kind
[1:23:43] amen stay with me just for a little bit
[1:23:45] and we're just going to lay some
[1:23:47] foundation and we'll preach
[1:23:49] all right every seed was to bring forth
[1:23:52] of his kind
[1:23:54] kind after kind
[1:23:56] you see hybrids are not in the original
[1:24:02] in the in the book of leviticus 19 god
[1:24:05] charged israel keep my degrees
[1:24:08] do not make different kinds of animals
[1:24:12] and so he he he forbid the israelites of
[1:24:18] mating a donkey to horse that was
[1:24:20] forbidden because it was crossing the
[1:24:23] species
[1:24:25] are you with me and god is for original
[1:24:29] i made them like i wanted them
[1:24:32] i started the church like i wanted it
[1:24:35] and i'm going to have a church like i
[1:24:37] started
[1:24:39] amen
[1:24:40] amen i began it the way i wanted it
[1:24:43] and that's what i'm going to have in the
[1:24:44] end time
[1:24:46] i'm going to have one that is exactly
[1:24:48] like the original seed
[1:24:51] she won't be different
[1:24:53] she won't be across species
[1:24:55] she won't be an improved species
[1:24:58] she will be the exact same thing that
[1:25:02] there was in the original are you with
[1:25:04] me now now you go all the way back to
[1:25:07] genesis
[1:25:08] where man left god
[1:25:10] where adam's bride eve failed and
[1:25:13] through that broke forth twins we know
[1:25:15] she did she brought 14 and then again
[1:25:18] bear his brother abel
[1:25:20] but there but you see
[1:25:23] this
[1:25:24] it goes all the way back as end time
[1:25:26] prophecies repeat and we come back
[1:25:29] to the same place
[1:25:32] notice this
[1:25:34] every age has its chance at its own
[1:25:36] revival
[1:25:38] and in there they have a chance to be
[1:25:41] born back to the original
[1:25:46] and we stand at the same place in this
[1:25:49] day and hour of bride to come back to be
[1:25:52] born back to the original to be a people
[1:25:55] birth of the word
[1:25:58] not a corruptible seed but of
[1:26:00] incorruptible
[1:26:02] somebody with me now
[1:26:03] so it this time
[1:26:05] this time is endtime prophecies repeat
[1:26:08] there is a word born bride who defeats
[1:26:10] satan
[1:26:11] who turns down his lies who brings forth
[1:26:14] true
[1:26:15] sons of god
[1:26:17] amen the end time prophecies repeat we
[1:26:20] get another chance of this this time he
[1:26:22] will have a church
[1:26:24] and it will be a bride without
[1:26:26] defilement
[1:26:27] amen this church the gates of hell will
[1:26:30] not prevail against because it's built
[1:26:32] on the full revelation of who he is
[1:26:36] are you with me now although eve failed
[1:26:40] remember the bride is predestinated not
[1:26:44] to fall
[1:26:47] amen now they didn't say that we
[1:26:49] wouldn't quibble and wobble and make
[1:26:51] mistakes and
[1:26:53] and even brother branham said and proven
[1:26:55] his words that sometimes taunts
[1:26:56] christians holding things wrong
[1:26:58] believing they're right
[1:26:59] and you have and i have and we all have
[1:27:03] right and man there's been a lot of
[1:27:05] misunderstandings down the road
[1:27:07] amen but this bride is predestinated not
[1:27:10] to fall
[1:27:12] amen notice he said god made manifest in
[1:27:15] christ christ made manifest his bride as
[1:27:18] god took from the body of adam the woman
[1:27:20] and she failed god has took from the
[1:27:22] body of christ his flesh his body which
[1:27:25] is his word and is bringing a bride out
[1:27:28] that won't fall
[1:27:30] by the nomination her creed no sir but
[1:27:32] she's coming back with the pure
[1:27:34] unadulterated word of god being manifest
[1:27:38] she is the second eve see the prophecy
[1:27:40] is repeating but she's not she is not
[1:27:44] breaking and spoiling her skirts of
[1:27:46] purity and holiness or a husband she'll
[1:27:48] stay with this word regardless of what
[1:27:51] anybody says
[1:27:55] hallelujah
[1:27:57] that's god is going to achieve what he
[1:27:59] set out for
[1:28:01] and that is to have a family
[1:28:03] she will be called the lamb's wife
[1:28:06] her offspring will be begotten of him
[1:28:10] now
[1:28:10] adam was a spoken word seed
[1:28:13] he was an original seed
[1:28:15] a man this seed could not die it was
[1:28:18] immortal
[1:28:19] unless
[1:28:21] it became perverted
[1:28:23] and become hybrid by mixing another word
[1:28:26] other than what god said
[1:28:30] notice here you see as long as he stayed
[1:28:33] with the original word
[1:28:35] he was immortal
[1:28:38] but the moment it got mixed it produced
[1:28:43] hybrids
[1:28:44] and a hybrid life
[1:28:47] now this mortal life we know is a
[1:28:50] perverted life
[1:28:51] we are all born hybrids
[1:28:54] by our first birth
[1:28:56] remember this now let me just stop here
[1:28:58] just for a minute and explain something
[1:29:00] because you know under the old testament
[1:29:03] a a child that was um born out of
[1:29:06] wedlock
[1:29:07] that he was considered a bastard child
[1:29:10] he couldn't enter the congregation for
[1:29:12] ten generations
[1:29:13] eight or ten now
[1:29:15] why was that
[1:29:17] god
[1:29:18] was preparing a people
[1:29:20] for there to be a virgin
[1:29:23] to conceive
[1:29:25] so he put things in the word to prepare
[1:29:28] for that virgin coming
[1:29:31] are you with me gentiles didn't have
[1:29:33] that
[1:29:35] they met
[1:29:36] gentiles did not have that they they had
[1:29:38] shrine prostitutes in their religion
[1:29:41] that committed fornications and
[1:29:42] adulteries and and sex acts
[1:29:46] but you see again with israel it made
[1:29:49] very clear you know all the laws about
[1:29:53] about rape and incense and adultery and
[1:29:56] the stoning and everything else to
[1:29:58] eradicate sin out of israel
[1:30:02] by law
[1:30:04] are you with me
[1:30:05] but i want you to notice as we're saying
[1:30:08] that when it comes that to that it that
[1:30:11] does not apply in the new covenant
[1:30:15] you see under the old covenant they had
[1:30:17] one birth
[1:30:21] amen that's all they had was one birth
[1:30:23] and you had to be born in the lineage of
[1:30:25] abraham
[1:30:27] is that right
[1:30:28] amen it was the the covenant was for
[1:30:30] abraham's seed
[1:30:32] so you had to be born in his lineage
[1:30:36] amen so they only had one birth
[1:30:40] but that's not the way it is with this
[1:30:42] one
[1:30:43] amen we have a new birth now
[1:30:46] and that new birth it breathes out all
[1:30:49] the cup
[1:30:52] are you with me
[1:30:53] amen listen if the blood of jesus christ
[1:30:56] could not cleanse an illegitimate child
[1:30:59] who had no choice of his own on how he
[1:31:02] was brought
[1:31:04] and the blood of jesus christ did not
[1:31:06] have the power to remit that sin
[1:31:10] and make him where that he could be
[1:31:11] baptized with the holy ghost and go in a
[1:31:14] rapture
[1:31:15] then the blood of jesus christ is no
[1:31:17] more powerful than the blood of bulls
[1:31:19] and goats
[1:31:20] but i want you to know the blood of
[1:31:22] jesus christ it eradicates every sin
[1:31:30] sin
[1:31:31] amen no matter how you were born
[1:31:35] it don't matter what your mama did your
[1:31:37] daddy did or your grandparents and by
[1:31:39] the way you need to be able to go back
[1:31:41] 10 generations in order to be able to
[1:31:44] come into the congregation of the lord
[1:31:46] amen so you know pretty much all of us
[1:31:49] would have been out
[1:31:52] is that right and let me just say it
[1:31:54] even further that it would even be more
[1:31:57] no gentile could have been saved
[1:31:59] you'd have never found a virgin gentile
[1:32:03] amen that wasn't that was or a a gentile
[1:32:06] that was born of holy matrimony for ten
[1:32:09] generations you'd have never found them
[1:32:12] they had no moral codes they had no law
[1:32:15] they had no word of god but the holy
[1:32:17] ghost fell on them and gave them the
[1:32:19] same covenant that it did to jewish
[1:32:21] people
[1:32:29] now so let me just say this you know we
[1:32:32] are but we because of our first birth
[1:32:38] we were all born hybrid
[1:32:42] if i could say it brother branham's word
[1:32:44] we're all bastard born
[1:32:49] just quit holding your nose up at
[1:32:50] somebody else
[1:32:56] don't you dare do that in my presence
[1:32:58] yes
[1:32:59] i'll let you know who you are
[1:33:01] you're just like the rest of us
[1:33:03] you're hybrid
[1:33:05] you were born between
[1:33:08] and i'm going to read the quote between
[1:33:10] satan and eve
[1:33:14] a hybrid
[1:33:16] you've got a hybrid body
[1:33:18] hybrid flesh
[1:33:20] amen
[1:33:21] and let me tell you about sin sin is not
[1:33:24] a creation
[1:33:26] it is a perverted faith
[1:33:29] death is not a creation it's a perverted
[1:33:32] life
[1:33:33] so brother branham tells us there was
[1:33:35] never such thing as a creation of sin he
[1:33:38] said now that didn't go down good did it
[1:33:40] sin is not a creation no sir sin is a
[1:33:43] perversion
[1:33:44] there is only one creator and that's god
[1:33:47] sin is righteousness perverted what is
[1:33:51] adultery righteousness perverted what is
[1:33:54] a lie truth
[1:33:56] misrepresented what is a curse word
[1:33:58] god's blessing turned to a curse word to
[1:34:01] uh to god instead of a blessing sin is
[1:34:04] not a creation sin is a perversion
[1:34:08] so satan could not create sin
[1:34:11] he only perverted what god created
[1:34:17] that's exactly right death is only a
[1:34:19] perversion of life
[1:34:21] now think of that sin is not a creation
[1:34:24] that's why you see it's got to end
[1:34:28] it's only temporary
[1:34:30] it's got the sinful world has to come to
[1:34:33] an end
[1:34:34] because it's not a reasonable seed
[1:34:38] are you with me amen now the reason for
[1:34:41] the need for someone to be born again
[1:34:45] what's this now the first preaching of
[1:34:47] jesus you must be born again
[1:34:51] and the reason for this is because we
[1:34:54] were born hybrid
[1:34:57] now wait a minute he even told this to
[1:34:59] nicodemus
[1:35:01] who could trace his millennials backward
[1:35:03] all the way to abraham perhaps
[1:35:05] he he would tell nicodemus you must be
[1:35:08] born again you see it's for every person
[1:35:12] because no matter whether you're jew or
[1:35:13] whether you're greek whether you're
[1:35:15] gentile whether you're black whether
[1:35:17] you're white whether you're purple
[1:35:18] whatever your color is
[1:35:21] amen we were born hybrid
[1:35:24] and unable to breed ourselves back to
[1:35:28] life again
[1:35:29] once you mix the seed it can no longer
[1:35:33] go back to the original
[1:35:36] yes sir
[1:35:37] remember i remember years ago you know
[1:35:39] brother old brother chambliss well you
[1:35:41] know was out there with me and and was
[1:35:44] telling me about um the siege you know
[1:35:46] he said now this corn he said
[1:35:50] he said uh you it's hybrid
[1:35:53] he said but you plant it it'll make a
[1:35:55] crop up next year
[1:35:57] but the problem is
[1:35:59] it won't make the same thing the hybrid
[1:36:01] was
[1:36:02] it will not reproduce true
[1:36:06] that's right are you with me
[1:36:08] imagine so it's like it is a hybrid it
[1:36:11] it can never go back to its original
[1:36:15] okay because once it once it come back
[1:36:17] and no matter what you do you can never
[1:36:19] breed that back to the original grains
[1:36:21] that made it
[1:36:23] the you see the the the the
[1:36:26] hybrid cross
[1:36:27] now again every child born in the world
[1:36:30] is a product of the hybriding between
[1:36:34] satan and eve
[1:36:37] abel was not a hybrid in the sense that
[1:36:40] cain was came was the offspring of the
[1:36:43] serpent
[1:36:44] the bible said he was that wicked one
[1:36:47] but yet abel was born of the knowledge
[1:36:53] that the serpent brought eve
[1:36:56] and not as adam came by the spoken word
[1:37:02] so you see then seth was not born
[1:37:05] correctly either
[1:37:10] understand once
[1:37:13] once that sin entered you could not by
[1:37:16] natural breathing breathe yourself out
[1:37:23] now
[1:37:24] although that seth was born of the union
[1:37:27] of adam and eve he still was not the
[1:37:31] original seed he didn't come the way god
[1:37:34] or dang man to come he came with a life
[1:37:37] of death
[1:37:38] he would die
[1:37:40] on his altar
[1:37:42] now in genesis chapter 5 verse 1 you see
[1:37:46] this is the book of the generations of
[1:37:48] adam in the day god created man
[1:37:51] now wait a minute he created man in the
[1:37:55] likeness of god
[1:37:57] made he him
[1:37:59] so he was made in the likeness of god
[1:38:02] right
[1:38:03] male and female created he them and
[1:38:07] blessed him and called their name adam
[1:38:09] in the day when they were created and
[1:38:11] adam lived 130 years and began to son in
[1:38:14] what
[1:38:16] his own likeness
[1:38:19] after his image
[1:38:21] and call his name seth
[1:38:24] oh now you know maybe you're not careful
[1:38:26] you didn't think well now adam was in
[1:38:28] the image of god so you know now says in
[1:38:30] the image of god
[1:38:32] no
[1:38:33] adam is not in the image of god
[1:38:36] he's a fallen image
[1:38:41] so seth is born
[1:38:43] with a fallen nature
[1:38:46] he's not in the likeness of god
[1:38:48] he's not original seed he didn't come
[1:38:50] from the hand of god he didn't come from
[1:38:52] the word he didn't come by the spoken
[1:38:54] word
[1:38:55] he came from the knowledge that the
[1:38:56] serpent taught eve
[1:38:58] amen so he is a fallen likeness what
[1:39:01] image a fallen image he is not an
[1:39:04] immortal man he's a mortal man
[1:39:07] amen he's not a son of immortal life
[1:39:09] he's a son of mortal life
[1:39:13] so seth was not born in the likeness of
[1:39:15] god to be born of god required that a
[1:39:19] man be born through creation
[1:39:24] amen boy begotten of the spirit through
[1:39:27] the world
[1:39:28] notice this is what the new birth is
[1:39:30] being born again not a corruptible seed
[1:39:33] by the will of man because every man
[1:39:36] brings forth corruptible seed
[1:39:38] and man that will do every child lord is
[1:39:41] gonna die
[1:39:44] every sweetheart that takes their their
[1:39:46] sweetheart down to the altar one day one
[1:39:49] will be gone
[1:39:50] the other left
[1:39:52] till that one's gone
[1:39:56] that's the way it all ends
[1:39:58] it's a hybrid life
[1:40:00] now brother branham said in spoken words
[1:40:02] in order to see but he said every man no
[1:40:05] matter whether he's a pope
[1:40:07] now that's considered the holiest man in
[1:40:10] christianity
[1:40:11] priest
[1:40:12] that's a lower man in the catholic
[1:40:14] church a bishop that's in between man
[1:40:17] whatever he is he dies because he's a
[1:40:20] hybrid he was born between satan and eve
[1:40:24] they and they call it whatever you want
[1:40:26] to it was satan and eve
[1:40:28] the original word had nothing to do with
[1:40:31] it the original word was life and he had
[1:40:34] hybrid it and it brought death now we
[1:40:37] know satan is a spirit but he used the
[1:40:40] serpent
[1:40:41] a man not a snake but a subtle beast to
[1:40:44] the field and he would work through him
[1:40:46] he would talk through him and he would
[1:40:48] pre-crea he would procreate
[1:40:52] procreate through him
[1:40:54] are you with me now the bible said that
[1:40:57] i will put enmity between thee and
[1:41:01] between the serpent and his seed and
[1:41:04] thou and thy seed
[1:41:06] is that right so the bible is clear the
[1:41:08] serpent had a seed
[1:41:10] that's right
[1:41:12] amen and they and remember
[1:41:14] and remember when it comes down again
[1:41:17] there was these hybrids
[1:41:20] that jesus would say to them you are of
[1:41:23] your father the devil
[1:41:30] come on
[1:41:31] and then when he's on the cross there
[1:41:34] who bruised him was it man or was it
[1:41:36] snakes crawling on the ground
[1:41:40] you see the serpent seed was there
[1:41:46] but the problem of it is is we were all
[1:41:48] born hybrid
[1:41:52] serpent seed is not a race
[1:41:55] it's the human race
[1:41:57] and we're all born lost we're all born
[1:42:01] needing a savior
[1:42:03] and there's no true breeding and no true
[1:42:05] race out of the humans we traded with
[1:42:08] the jews and it didn't work
[1:42:10] [Applause]
[1:42:12] amen come on yeah amen i mean you know
[1:42:15] it there was but let me just tell you
[1:42:18] there there is another birth
[1:42:22] amen and that new birth will bring you
[1:42:24] back to the original
[1:42:28] hallelujah where you're part of the
[1:42:30] original breeding because you don't come
[1:42:33] by man and woman you come not by the
[1:42:36] will of man or by some preacher but you
[1:42:39] come amen from the hand of god the word
[1:42:43] spoken creates a bride
[1:42:47] hallelujah don't you know that's what
[1:42:49] god did in the seas he sent a message to
[1:42:52] do what to create a bride to call a
[1:42:56] people to himself
[1:42:57] [Applause]
[1:42:59] hybrid people and hybrid systems
[1:43:03] with hybrid religion
[1:43:07] and he called you out
[1:43:10] and re-birth you
[1:43:18] hallelujah aren't you glad
[1:43:21] in the sixth seal brother brandon said
[1:43:22] every man was born of sex after born
[1:43:25] after sexual desire he was in the
[1:43:28] original sin
[1:43:29] satan in eve so he could not do it he's
[1:43:31] talking about claiming the book no man
[1:43:33] was worthy this is why
[1:43:35] there was nothing in no holy pope priest
[1:43:37] dr divinity whatever he might be he was
[1:43:40] nobody worthy and he couldn't be an
[1:43:42] angel because it had to be a kinsman he
[1:43:44] had to be a man so that god himself
[1:43:46] become a kinsmen by taking on human
[1:43:49] flesh through the virgin birth
[1:43:53] jesus was not born a hybrid
[1:43:57] he came of the virgin
[1:43:59] it was not of the will of man nor the
[1:44:01] will of flesh but of god
[1:44:04] amen this is where john traces is
[1:44:06] beginning others talk about his human
[1:44:09] life and said you know here he comes and
[1:44:11] they trace him all the way back to
[1:44:12] abraham and they know him to adam but
[1:44:14] not john john the eagle says in the
[1:44:17] beginning
[1:44:18] what's the word and the word was with
[1:44:21] god and the word was god and the word
[1:44:25] became flesh and dwelt among us
[1:44:29] hallelujah i want you to know he is the
[1:44:31] father a man of a new creation
[1:44:34] amen that old things are passed away and
[1:44:37] behold all things have become new
[1:44:39] [Applause]
[1:44:45] bear with me as i read this quotation
[1:44:47] from what shall i do with jesus
[1:44:49] called christ
[1:44:51] like by the same means that the mother
[1:44:54] eve corrupted the whole world to be to a
[1:44:56] physical death
[1:44:58] the mother eve listened
[1:45:00] mother e corrupted the whole human race
[1:45:03] by physical death by rejecting the word
[1:45:07] by accepting something almost like it
[1:45:10] she caused all physical death because
[1:45:12] she left the true word and believed the
[1:45:14] true word oh but just a little bit
[1:45:18] one little disagreement with the lord of
[1:45:21] god caused every heartache every death
[1:45:24] and everything's been on the earth eve
[1:45:26] done it
[1:45:27] the mother of death
[1:45:31] now you see where we're coming from the
[1:45:33] mother of death noticed she just
[1:45:35] disbelieved the word
[1:45:36] she said god has said satan said that's
[1:45:38] right
[1:45:39] god has said that's right god has said
[1:45:42] that's right god has said yes
[1:45:44] that's is that well in a way that's
[1:45:46] right you see but that isn't all of it
[1:45:49] see you'll have your eyes open and
[1:45:51] you'll be
[1:45:52] but god is set and that settles it it's
[1:45:55] the word see it just started just one
[1:45:58] little misconstruing of the word and the
[1:46:01] same thing is ending the same way
[1:46:04] notice a daughter is a product of the
[1:46:06] mother and a father by union now here's
[1:46:08] something shocking but death physical
[1:46:11] physical death is the uniting of mother
[1:46:14] eve and satan together by disbelieving
[1:46:18] god's word
[1:46:19] they united and brought forth the
[1:46:22] product of death
[1:46:23] death is the product of uniting satan
[1:46:26] and eve together
[1:46:28] notice now let me just interject again
[1:46:31] it's through the instrumentality of the
[1:46:33] serpent that he would use
[1:46:35] now
[1:46:36] you see
[1:46:38] eve had the word satan is against the
[1:46:41] word i look almost 99 and 99 hundredths
[1:46:45] of it satan admitted was right so close
[1:46:48] in the bible in the last days were to
[1:46:50] see the very elective it was possible
[1:46:52] see how it comes in it's always been
[1:46:55] how it's going up going out the same way
[1:46:57] united of unbelief in the full word of
[1:46:59] god you got it that's what brought death
[1:47:02] is uniting unbelief with the word
[1:47:03] unbelief just one little bitty part of
[1:47:06] it little bitty teeny bit 101
[1:47:11] but it must be 100
[1:47:15] that's all
[1:47:17] notice god's daughter the church the
[1:47:19] bride is also a product of god and his
[1:47:22] word united
[1:47:24] the holy spirit united in a body of
[1:47:27] flesh it produced the son of god a
[1:47:30] product of the righteousness of god and
[1:47:33] in the last days as we're told as it was
[1:47:35] in the days of sodom the bride will be
[1:47:38] united by the word made manifest in
[1:47:40] flesh the holy spirit sealing them unto
[1:47:43] god and seeing an unbelief out
[1:47:47] on the outside
[1:47:49] now think of it where when we have come
[1:47:51] to birth
[1:47:53] remember when they came to bring forth
[1:47:56] the seed
[1:47:58] adam and eve
[1:47:59] by the spoken word what happened here
[1:48:02] comes satan there to pervert the word to
[1:48:06] keep eve from the word birth
[1:48:10] is that right
[1:48:12] now when it come for israel to go into
[1:48:15] the land which the land typed the holy
[1:48:17] ghost
[1:48:18] amen justification called out of egypt
[1:48:22] sanctification to the wilderness baptism
[1:48:24] of the holy ghost the land
[1:48:27] are you with me amen so what happened at
[1:48:29] cadiz barnea
[1:48:31] what they do they went over there and
[1:48:33] said we can't take it
[1:48:35] we can't get the holy ghost we can't
[1:48:38] possess the promises of god we can't
[1:48:40] really be sons of god
[1:48:44] are you with me so brother branham
[1:48:46] called them borderline believers and he
[1:48:48] said when it comes to borderline come
[1:48:50] right up to that spot to receive the
[1:48:53] holy ghost for the new birth what did
[1:48:55] the devil do he come around and try to
[1:48:59] twist it around oh he'll do everything
[1:49:03] that's in his known power to keep the
[1:49:06] people out of there
[1:49:09] notice what do you do satan will do
[1:49:12] everything
[1:49:13] it is
[1:49:14] known power
[1:49:16] to keep
[1:49:18] the people
[1:49:19] out of there
[1:49:21] notice when when there was a deliver
[1:49:24] that was coming
[1:49:26] moses was going to lead the children of
[1:49:28] israel out and he's a baby that was born
[1:49:30] well satan was right there
[1:49:33] to destroy the seed
[1:49:35] come on
[1:49:36] amen then we come down to the days of
[1:49:38] jesus what happened just as soon as the
[1:49:41] announcement is made the child is born
[1:49:44] satan is right there the beast there to
[1:49:46] try to destroy it and brought through a
[1:49:48] vision through a dream sends them down
[1:49:50] to egypt to escape the wrath of herod
[1:49:54] is that right because he's right there
[1:49:55] to kill the child as soon as he was born
[1:50:00] hey remember remember now church that's
[1:50:03] why all the gates of hell is against us
[1:50:07] hallelujah are you with me amen that's
[1:50:10] why that we're we're in our awful age
[1:50:13] and horrible time it's cause satan is
[1:50:16] right there with all his darkness
[1:50:19] coming with his tree of knowledge
[1:50:22] taking our kids into school and
[1:50:23] brainwashing them against god
[1:50:27] with their liberal arts and all their
[1:50:29] other ideas of man and their evolution
[1:50:31] and everything to kill the faith
[1:50:35] of the children
[1:50:37] [Applause]
[1:50:38] because he's there to wipe out the seed
[1:50:44] hallelujah but in the same time god's
[1:50:46] got a word of perservation he's going to
[1:50:50] have a pride without splatter wrinkle
[1:50:52] amen there's a protection and a hedge
[1:50:54] around his children and he will burn
[1:50:57] them into the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:51:00] and there'll be a token applied for
[1:51:02] rapture
[1:51:06] amen the token is not a tape the token
[1:51:08] is not a book the token is the person of
[1:51:11] jesus christ the holy ghost
[1:51:14] and without it you're lost
[1:51:18] now so satan will do everything in his
[1:51:22] known power
[1:51:23] to keep people out of there
[1:51:26] so you know the very moment that you
[1:51:28] began to
[1:51:30] you know to see the holy spirit move
[1:51:32] altar calls being given young people
[1:51:35] giving the heart to god or people period
[1:51:37] giving their heart to god whether young
[1:51:39] or old surrendering the holy ghost
[1:51:41] coming upon them what we have satan
[1:51:43] coming along
[1:51:45] doing everything in his known power
[1:51:49] to try to keep that woman from birth
[1:51:54] now so you and notice what he'll do he
[1:51:57] will push them over to one side
[1:52:01] one side of intellectualism
[1:52:04] or to the other side of fanaticism
[1:52:09] he'll do anything
[1:52:12] to keep them
[1:52:14] within his known power to keep them out
[1:52:16] of there
[1:52:18] now
[1:52:20] satan
[1:52:21] had heard god say be fruitful and
[1:52:23] multiply replenish the earth
[1:52:26] so he takes god's word and he
[1:52:29] twisted
[1:52:31] using reason instead of supernatural
[1:52:34] faith
[1:52:35] he shows them how it can be done by
[1:52:38] works
[1:52:40] instead of the supernatural
[1:52:44] amen now you know god would show with
[1:52:45] isaac it ain't going to be through works
[1:52:48] your body is now dead god would wait
[1:52:50] until they could not do it on their own
[1:52:54] isaac would be a supernatural child
[1:52:57] that was born of the prophecy
[1:53:00] because he was portraying the new race
[1:53:04] would be born of the supernatural
[1:53:07] it would be not born of man's ability
[1:53:19] look how they've tried to do it you know
[1:53:21] they turn around every time you know a
[1:53:23] spiritual move comes and and then
[1:53:26] you know they do it they turn around
[1:53:28] justification by faith and they make it
[1:53:31] where you just come to the altar and
[1:53:32] shake your hand
[1:53:36] works
[1:53:38] they turn it from sanctification of a
[1:53:40] supernatural experience of god cleansing
[1:53:42] from habits
[1:53:44] and they turn it into works
[1:53:47] i jumped and i shouted
[1:53:49] or i joined the church
[1:53:52] pentecost did the same thing
[1:53:55] you know it started out a supernatural
[1:53:57] move but they turned it into
[1:54:00] a a
[1:54:01] a learned behavior
[1:54:06] word that beat them on the back and
[1:54:08] jiggle their chin till they manufacture
[1:54:11] the language they turn it into works
[1:54:14] instead of the supernatural
[1:54:18] amen
[1:54:21] you see you see what does it do it it
[1:54:24] brings a mixture a hybrid
[1:54:27] this is what it
[1:54:29] this is what ishmael was he was never
[1:54:31] the original seed
[1:54:33] god didn't even recognize him whatsoever
[1:54:36] and then he called him a wild man he
[1:54:39] won't be subject to anything i say
[1:54:44] ishmael was completely rejected
[1:54:48] am i because only the supernatural
[1:54:51] is god's offspring
[1:54:56] now so death came by what satan taught
[1:54:59] eve by putting a spin
[1:55:01] on the original word
[1:55:03] you talk about a spin doctor
[1:55:05] satan is one
[1:55:07] he will take the knowledge of the
[1:55:09] revelation and spin it
[1:55:12] and exalt it over the word
[1:55:15] they did it in paul's day
[1:55:18] you know paul peter said in ii peter 3
[1:55:21] 16 and he spoke about beloved paul
[1:55:23] according to wisdom given to him is
[1:55:25] written to you also in all his epistles
[1:55:28] speaking of these
[1:55:30] in them of these things ii peter 3 16
[1:55:33] in which some things are hard to be
[1:55:35] understood
[1:55:37] which they that are unlearned and
[1:55:39] unstable rest
[1:55:41] twist
[1:55:43] as they do also the other scriptures
[1:55:46] unto their own destruction
[1:55:50] so here again the word was coming
[1:55:52] but right there as the word is coming
[1:55:55] here satan is there
[1:55:57] with with to twist
[1:56:04] you want to think sometimes it's all
[1:56:06] done in the pulpit now there's a lot of
[1:56:08] this stuff goes wrong with a tablet
[1:56:16] i met men twisting the words
[1:56:18] they were twisting the word the
[1:56:20] revelations brought by the apostle paul
[1:56:23] and bringing death with it
[1:56:25] paul himself spoke of hymenous and
[1:56:28] alexander who were destitute of true
[1:56:30] faith and he he had handed them over to
[1:56:33] satan that they learned not to blaspheme
[1:56:35] and distort the truth he's saying that
[1:56:37] word did eat the body away like a canker
[1:56:40] because they were saying the
[1:56:42] resurrection was passed and they were
[1:56:45] all by that overthrow in the faith of
[1:56:47] some
[1:56:48] you see their false teaching was deadly
[1:56:52] not just a disagreement over a minor
[1:56:55] part of doctrine they were teaching that
[1:56:57] the resurrection had already happened
[1:57:00] there's no doubt they were taking the
[1:57:02] spiritual application of the
[1:57:03] resurrection rather than to the ground
[1:57:06] until they did away with the literal
[1:57:08] resurrection amen
[1:57:12] spiritualizing something
[1:57:15] when it has a supernatural event
[1:57:20] perhaps
[1:57:21] they were
[1:57:22] you know they were teaching that the
[1:57:24] resurrection of the christian was not
[1:57:26] literal but merely a spiritual is
[1:57:28] symbolic resurrection that had already
[1:57:31] happened see
[1:57:32] you see there's the problem in every age
[1:57:35] we have the same pattern
[1:57:38] brother branham tells us in the church
[1:57:40] but he said that's why the light is
[1:57:42] given
[1:57:43] through some god-given messenger in a
[1:57:46] certain area and then from that
[1:57:48] messenger that spreads the light
[1:57:52] that spreads the light
[1:57:54] through the ministry of others
[1:57:56] notice this not just his ministry
[1:57:59] ministry of others
[1:58:01] spread the light
[1:58:02] amen
[1:58:03] and he said who have been faithfully
[1:58:06] chopped
[1:58:08] it's really important to get in the word
[1:58:11] to be faithfully it's not just important
[1:58:13] for the preacher it's important for you
[1:58:18] to get in the tapes to listen to the
[1:58:19] prophet of god to hear what the
[1:58:21] messenger said
[1:58:24] that so many people misled because they
[1:58:27] they quit listening
[1:58:30] they want to sleep on the pew somewhere
[1:58:34] but notice he said of course all those
[1:58:36] who go out don't always learn how
[1:58:38] necessary it is to speak only watson
[1:58:41] messenger said had spoken remember paul
[1:58:44] warned the people to say only what he
[1:58:46] said first corinthians 14 37 if any man
[1:58:49] think himself to be a prophet or
[1:58:51] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[1:58:53] things that i write unto you are the
[1:58:54] commandments of the lord what came the
[1:58:57] word of god out from you came unto you
[1:58:59] only they add to
[1:59:01] they add here they take away there and
[1:59:03] soon the message is no longer pure and
[1:59:05] the revival dies down how careful we
[1:59:08] must be to hear one voice
[1:59:11] what is that voice it's the voice of the
[1:59:13] spirit
[1:59:15] amen for the spirit house but one voice
[1:59:18] which is the voice of god
[1:59:21] amen and paul warned them to say what he
[1:59:23] said even as peter did likewise he
[1:59:25] warned them that even he paul could not
[1:59:28] change one word of what he had been
[1:59:30] given by revelation oh how important it
[1:59:33] is to hear the voice of god by the way
[1:59:35] of his messenger and then say what has
[1:59:38] been given them to say to the churches
[1:59:41] so the ministry is to take what the
[1:59:43] prophet said and say it
[1:59:47] amen
[1:59:52] now
[1:59:53] but they must stay with what he
[1:59:57] that's right said doing that they didn't
[1:59:59] just get up and read paul's epistle they
[2:00:01] got up and preached peter or timothy
[2:00:03] preach the word
[2:00:06] get up and preach and rightly divide it
[2:00:11] minister from it
[2:00:12] these things that i have committed to
[2:00:15] you these mysteries he said commit them
[2:00:17] to faithful men
[2:00:19] amen
[2:00:21] and i'll tell you you know i tell you
[2:00:23] friends god's gonna have a a true
[2:00:25] ministry somewhere
[2:00:27] somebody that'll stay with the word of
[2:00:29] god
[2:00:30] hallelujah somebody didn't stand for
[2:00:32] truth in this hour somebody's gonna do
[2:00:35] it
[2:00:38] i talked to a man one time sat across
[2:00:40] from the table from him his son was a
[2:00:43] preacher and he said well i don't
[2:00:44] believe in preachers
[2:00:46] i said well
[2:00:48] i
[2:00:49] i believe you do
[2:00:51] he said
[2:00:53] no i don't believe in preachers
[2:00:55] you must not know me i don't believe in
[2:00:57] preachers
[2:00:58] and i said
[2:01:00] well
[2:01:01] i said
[2:01:03] i believe you do believe in preachers
[2:01:05] i said because i believe you're a child
[2:01:08] of god
[2:01:09] and god can't deny his word
[2:01:12] he said well brother jim there's just no
[2:01:14] nobody that's preaching truth ain't
[2:01:16] nobody right ain't nobody doing right
[2:01:18] ain't nobody i mean one's after money
[2:01:20] once that's the popularity one's after
[2:01:22] this one's after that ain't nobody right
[2:01:26] so i don't even believe it i said well
[2:01:29] i said you got a problem
[2:01:32] you got a problem with your god
[2:01:35] he's really many god
[2:01:37] he ain't able to keep his word
[2:01:43] i said he said
[2:01:44] i give unto the church
[2:01:46] apostles prophets teachers evangelist
[2:01:48] pastors for the perfecting of the church
[2:01:51] and you tell me god ain't big enough to
[2:01:53] do that
[2:01:55] amen if god said it god's going to do it
[2:01:59] you said but i see this way i don't care
[2:02:01] about your failures
[2:02:03] i don't care what you've seen i don't
[2:02:05] care what you think i mean the word of
[2:02:08] god is true
[2:02:09] jesus commits a man to preach the word
[2:02:13] and when paul commissioned him preach
[2:02:15] the word brother branham commissioners
[2:02:17] preach the word he ordained me and carry
[2:02:19] the word
[2:02:21] i don't care you look at the failures i
[2:02:23] tell you what
[2:02:25] you don't believe in preachers
[2:02:28] no they've hurt me they've done this
[2:02:30] they've done that they went after money
[2:02:31] they went out to popularity they went
[2:02:33] after this
[2:02:34] well i don't believe in people
[2:02:39] they've hurt me
[2:02:41] they've abused me
[2:02:42] they've mocked me they've made fun of me
[2:02:45] they've caused me all kinds of trouble i
[2:02:47] just don't believe in people
[2:02:49] i don't believe people exist anymore
[2:02:58] see how foolish that is
[2:03:01] if you have the holy ghost you have to
[2:03:03] believe the word
[2:03:06] amen you have to go back to the
[2:03:08] apostolic formula the bible formula
[2:03:13] and that is that the
[2:03:15] mysteries are committed to faithful men
[2:03:18] who are stewards of the word of god
[2:03:21] now brother branham said in condemnation
[2:03:23] by representation now this may get a
[2:03:25] little bit sticky so hold on for a
[2:03:26] little bit
[2:03:28] don't be carried away with hybrid stuff
[2:03:31] is not right it'll finally come to his
[2:03:34] end it can't go back when it's hybrid
[2:03:36] it's finished it can never reproduce
[2:03:38] itself
[2:03:40] if it does it's a dwarf look at the what
[2:03:43] luther or wesley revival when we get
[2:03:45] that philadelphia next age what revival
[2:03:48] they had look at the next revival look
[2:03:50] at the next revival it just keeps
[2:03:52] dwarfing dwarfing dwarf and dwarf until
[2:03:54] now and look where it's at now you see
[2:03:57] he's talking about them losing strength
[2:03:59] vigor vitality spiritually
[2:04:01] not necessarily physically
[2:04:04] because he actually got bigger
[2:04:07] bigger buildings bigger numbers
[2:04:11] amen but like a mew might be still tall
[2:04:14] and statue may weigh 15 2 000 pounds or
[2:04:17] 1500 2 000 pounds but it loses the
[2:04:20] strength to reproduce
[2:04:24] amen it can't bring one life
[2:04:28] now so he said look where the baptist
[2:04:30] started with john smith look where it
[2:04:31] dwart to look at the pentecostals that
[2:04:33] started in 1906 they interbred with the
[2:04:36] world and brought in the things of the
[2:04:39] world and the doctrine of the world they
[2:04:40] adopted for the holy ghost a handshake
[2:04:44] they adopted for a mercen sprinkling
[2:04:47] they adopted for water baptism in the
[2:04:49] name of jesus christ father son and holy
[2:04:52] ghost like the world they adopted a
[2:04:54] handshake to receive the holy ghost
[2:04:56] instead of speaking in tongues and the
[2:04:58] power of god to follow
[2:05:01] they put divine healing in the doctor's
[2:05:04] office instead of on your knees in
[2:05:05] prayer
[2:05:07] they hybrid themselves and their dwarven
[2:05:10] each year dwarfing
[2:05:12] not in numbers not in stature not in
[2:05:15] education
[2:05:17] but spiritually dwarfed
[2:05:22] spoken words original seed he said to
[2:05:25] mix it brings a hybrid crop hybrid crop
[2:05:28] is a dead crop for its rebreathing it
[2:05:30] won't re-breed itself it can't because
[2:05:33] god said so it has to bring forth of its
[2:05:35] kind you mixed it
[2:05:38] no now you can see the church right
[2:05:40] there can't you see where we're going to
[2:05:41] wind up it died there for it cannot
[2:05:43] bring forth of its kind why it's mixed
[2:05:47] you can never do nothing with it it's
[2:05:49] dead it's finished it's all right that's
[2:05:52] why each generation has its own revival
[2:05:55] a chance at the word i'm glad we got our
[2:05:58] chance at the word
[2:06:00] so the sovereign god and the judgment
[2:06:02] john wesley's group will raise up and
[2:06:04] these starks watched methodists of today
[2:06:06] will answer for it
[2:06:08] and luther will raise that the catholics
[2:06:10] will raise it behind uh iranians martin
[2:06:13] polycarp and those will have to stand up
[2:06:15] to the judgment for hybriding the word
[2:06:18] of god to dogmas
[2:06:20] this group of lutherans that followed
[2:06:22] luther's revival will answer the same
[2:06:24] thing they booted the booty group of
[2:06:27] baptists that followed john smith's
[2:06:28] revival we'll do the same alexander
[2:06:30] campbell's will do the same thing the
[2:06:32] pentecostals will do the same thing that
[2:06:35] original revival when the holy ghost
[2:06:37] fell called out a people in gods trying
[2:06:40] to get his word to it and they organized
[2:06:42] said it over denominated and it died
[2:06:44] right there
[2:06:46] again christ's a mystery he talks about
[2:06:49] how that the devil is doing the same
[2:06:52] thing building up a hybrid church a
[2:06:54] hybrid by hybrid members
[2:06:57] by knowledge
[2:06:59] instead of the word by intellectual men
[2:07:03] instead of born again man
[2:07:06] building an intellectual kingdom that
[2:07:08] will outshine christ little see what did
[2:07:12] it what is it that did that fallen
[2:07:14] angels
[2:07:16] the bible says fallen angels who listen
[2:07:18] to lucifer instead of christ who they
[2:07:21] once belonged to is that right now
[2:07:23] listen close fallen angels what kind
[2:07:25] angels luther wesley catholic
[2:07:27] pentecostals who kept not their first
[2:07:29] estate like the angels did and has fell
[2:07:32] into organization
[2:07:34] like lucifer's main hold it nicely
[2:07:39] are you with me i want you to understand
[2:07:42] it is more than receiving the word as
[2:07:44] far as doctrines
[2:07:45] we must have the life
[2:07:47] manifested
[2:07:49] brother branham told us all the way back
[2:07:51] in in in freeport he said intellectually
[2:07:55] we're hearing the message
[2:07:57] but intellectually here that is not good
[2:07:59] enough
[2:08:01] it's got to be mixed with faith and
[2:08:03] faith has got to be united with it
[2:08:06] got to be germinated with life
[2:08:09] are you with me he said our faith isn't
[2:08:10] right intellectually we're hearing the
[2:08:12] message that god has given us seeing the
[2:08:14] signs he showed among us proving that by
[2:08:16] the bible it's there but how the church
[2:08:18] needs to lay in this present till it
[2:08:20] tenders up you know and gets sweet in
[2:08:22] the spirit so it can be down
[2:08:26] amen but buddy said someone sometimes
[2:08:28] speaking the message you get hearts you
[2:08:30] had to break it in like that because
[2:08:32] you've got to clinch a nail to make it
[2:08:33] whole but when the church once gets it
[2:08:36] the elect is called out and separated
[2:08:38] then in the presence of god i know it'll
[2:08:41] be something like the people was there
[2:08:44] and beyond the current time is what it's
[2:08:46] about there when it takes the rapture
[2:08:50] hallelujah people who are rejoicing in
[2:08:52] what paul preached
[2:08:54] not a new message not a different
[2:08:56] doctrine
[2:08:58] not a different ministry the same
[2:08:59] ministry the same life the same power
[2:09:02] the same holy ghost
[2:09:04] hallelujah not just the mechanics but
[2:09:06] the dynamics to go with it
[2:09:09] amen there's got to be more than
[2:09:10] mechanics
[2:09:12] it can't be just word only
[2:09:14] it's cut out the dynamics
[2:09:17] the life of christ
[2:09:19] you see more than the knowledge of the
[2:09:21] truth
[2:09:22] they must have the spirit of guarders
[2:09:24] not word yet
[2:09:26] my words they are spirit and they are
[2:09:28] light
[2:09:30] if it's just a letter it kills it's got
[2:09:32] to have the spirit in it
[2:09:34] amen there's got to be more than an
[2:09:36] intellectual conception
[2:09:38] and more than an emotion
[2:09:41] and and to prove this that this it is
[2:09:44] the holy ghost something more than
[2:09:47] emotion those who are born of it they
[2:09:50] overcome the world
[2:09:53] are you hearing me first john 5 4
[2:09:56] whosoever born of god over cometh the
[2:09:59] world
[2:10:00] so here he is one sign you're born of
[2:10:03] god you overcome
[2:10:08] are you with me that means you face your
[2:10:11] enemy and you overcome it that means
[2:10:15] that you don't are you with me you don't
[2:10:17] live with your sin you don't live with
[2:10:19] your excuses
[2:10:22] you overcome them
[2:10:25] hallelujah because you have god on the
[2:10:27] inside of you and greater is he that is
[2:10:30] in you than he that's in the world
[2:10:33] amen first john 5 18 we know whosoever
[2:10:36] born of god sinneth not
[2:10:38] amen that means he no longer disbelieves
[2:10:42] he that's born of god keepeth himself
[2:10:45] and that wicked one touches him not
[2:10:48] amen that's what i'm talking about i'm
[2:10:50] not talking about people born of god and
[2:10:52] they're still in
[2:10:54] pornography amen still an adultery still
[2:10:58] in all kinds of sin and smoking and
[2:11:00] drinking and lying and cursing
[2:11:03] living one way at church and then a
[2:11:05] different way outside the church
[2:11:08] amen he that is born of god cheaper than
[2:11:10] himself and the wicked one toucheth him
[2:11:14] not amen
[2:11:17] hallelujah amen
[2:11:20] now the holy ghost is not emotions but
[2:11:24] it has the motion with it
[2:11:27] and then time evangelism and i've read
[2:11:30] this quote before but it's too good not
[2:11:32] to read it again
[2:11:34] today the scientific theory of the
[2:11:36] modern so-called religious group
[2:11:38] have tried to prove this blessed thing
[2:11:40] that we have called the holy spirit is
[2:11:42] only emotion
[2:11:46] now
[2:11:47] actually they don't have any problem
[2:11:49] with dried confessions
[2:11:53] they
[2:11:54] they ain't have any problems somebody
[2:11:56] just walking up the altar shaking hands
[2:11:58] with the preacher and say i believe the
[2:11:59] message you got the holy ghost
[2:12:02] are you with me
[2:12:04] but they they have tried to prove
[2:12:07] this blessed holy spirit is only emotion
[2:12:10] it just don't stand up to their
[2:12:12] scientific theory what i'd like to ask
[2:12:14] them this is what makes them
[2:12:18] change hallelujah what makes the
[2:12:21] drunkard stop drinking
[2:12:26] amen it wasn't emotion the other day
[2:12:29] amen when brother james comes down here
[2:12:31] to the altar there and gives his heart
[2:12:33] to god it wasn't just emotion
[2:12:36] i mean he was a change
[2:12:38] amen that drinking fell off the other
[2:12:40] thing it meant things are changing in
[2:12:42] his life
[2:12:43] why because it works
[2:12:46] are you with me but it meant just doing
[2:12:48] that with him and did that with this one
[2:12:49] and that one and this one and that one
[2:12:51] and this one and that one and this one
[2:12:52] and that one i'm looking at new
[2:12:54] creations all over this building

[2:13:02] ceasar evil life what makes the drunkard
[2:13:05] stop drinking

[2:13:10] depart from the people
[2:13:13] what makes the deaf and the dumb and the
[2:13:16] blind and the dead raise up
[2:13:19] what makes it a man whether when a new
[2:13:21] convert comes into the church gives a
[2:13:23] heart to god lays their hands on a
[2:13:25] five-year-old child who came here
[2:13:29] born without hearing laser hands on him
[2:13:31] said i believe lord i claim my healing

[2:14:22] service
[2:14:24] he was more than a motion
[2:14:26] amen it was a supernatural presence that
[2:14:29] changed him in a moment
[2:14:32] everybody took him out of the life of
[2:14:33] drugs and fornication and sin of all

[2:15:35] so brother brandon said what makes the
[2:15:36] cancer diseases depart from the people
[2:15:38] the death the dumb the blind the dead to
[2:15:40] raise up
[2:15:42] explain that
[2:15:43] is that emotion
[2:15:45] it has emotion with it
[2:15:47] certainly
[2:15:50] anything that's alive has emotion
[2:15:52] anything that doesn't have emotion is
[2:15:54] dead
[2:15:55] and express the excuses the expression
[2:15:58] but i think we ought to bury some of our
[2:16:00] muslims religion then because it's dead
[2:16:04] it has no emotion to it any religion
[2:16:06] that has not emotion should be buried uh
[2:16:09] because it is emotional
[2:16:13] true religion is emotional
[2:16:18] they're mad but it's not only a motion
[2:16:21] oh no
[2:16:22] yeah the antichrist spirit would really
[2:16:25] like to put out our fire
[2:16:28] and make us a lukewarm cold and
[2:16:30] powerless people
[2:16:32] a powerless group whose only weapon is
[2:16:35] argument
[2:16:36] but we got more than that
[2:16:39] amen oh my you see we got more than that
[2:16:43] we know him but we don't just know the
[2:16:45] word we know him
[2:16:47] you see because brother branham told us
[2:16:48] in sirs we would see jesus just to know
[2:16:51] his word is not enough you must know him
[2:16:57] to know him by word that's all right but
[2:16:59] that's a long ways from being sufficient
[2:17:01] he says to knowing by the word we got to
[2:17:04] know him by the person of his
[2:17:05] resurrection
[2:17:07] so the true word
[2:17:09] brings
[2:17:10] a true experience
[2:17:14] now we're preaching about a word born
[2:17:16] bride
[2:17:17] the true word comes the prophet he tells
[2:17:20] you the true word you follow that true
[2:17:22] word and you get a true experience of
[2:17:25] the word
[2:17:27] because the word is made flesh in you
[2:17:29] and you become god's son and the word of
[2:17:31] god is revolving right out of you and
[2:17:33] out of god into you and because you're
[2:17:35] of his nature his spirit is in you and
[2:17:37] you'll do the works of god hallelujah
[2:17:39] the bible said so
[2:17:41] now there are those who have an
[2:17:44] emotional experience
[2:17:46] and there are others that
[2:17:48] and and when i say emotional that's all
[2:17:50] they got
[2:17:51] they're emotions term
[2:17:53] that's what happened with azusa street
[2:17:56] too often it was just their emotion
[2:17:58] their spirit realm
[2:18:01] and you can have the genuine holy ghost
[2:18:04] on your spirit realm and still be lost
[2:18:09] got to be the typos of the soul
[2:18:13] amen you can speak in genuine tongues
[2:18:16] genuine tongues
[2:18:18] not folks not made up not nothing not
[2:18:21] some kind of jabber i'm from a genuine
[2:18:23] tongues and still be lost
[2:18:26] because you see you can be anointed
[2:18:30] there in these outer realms
[2:18:33] and still be lost
[2:18:35] amen but there is a seal of god
[2:18:38] there is a true birth of the word there
[2:18:41] is a birth of malachi 4 that doesn't
[2:18:44] just come on the spirit realm it deals
[2:18:46] with the soul
[2:18:48] and it changes you from the inside out
[2:18:51] now so there are those who have an
[2:18:53] emotional experience and there are those
[2:18:55] that have just an intellectual
[2:18:56] experience
[2:19:00] and both of them are hybrids
[2:19:04] but i want you to know there is a true
[2:19:07] experience
[2:19:10] as brother branham confirmed in question
[2:19:12] answer 64
[2:19:13] you cannot receive the baptism of the
[2:19:16] holy ghost without having an experience
[2:19:19] when it happens
[2:19:21] i got the holy ghost and i didn't know
[2:19:23] it no you didn't get the holy ghost
[2:19:26] it's impossible can a child be born and
[2:19:28] not know it brother brandon said
[2:19:31] something happens
[2:19:35] it's not one certain evidence but
[2:19:37] something happens
[2:19:38] it's not a tongue it's not a dance it's
[2:19:40] not a shout but brother brandon said i
[2:19:42] don't care what form it comes in just as
[2:19:45] long as it changes you
[2:19:49] now so you cannot have the baptism of
[2:19:52] the holy ghost without an experience
[2:19:53] when it happened now you say i believe
[2:19:55] if you believe every speck of the word
[2:19:59] you believe every speck of the word you
[2:20:01] say you believe every speck of it then
[2:20:03] the word is laying there waiting for the
[2:20:05] holy spirit to put it to work
[2:20:08] but it takes the lighting of the candle
[2:20:10] here's the candle with the wick and with
[2:20:12] the tallow and everything that it has in
[2:20:14] that having that candle but until the
[2:20:16] fire comes on it will not shine any
[2:20:19] light no matter how perfect the candle
[2:20:21] is how per perfect it'll burn and
[2:20:24] everything it's got to be lit
[2:20:26] and then it burns
[2:20:27] and when you believe and are made up of
[2:20:29] the instructions of what the holy spirit
[2:20:31] is love joy peace long suffering good
[2:20:33] goodness fruits that it bears out until
[2:20:35] the holy spirit with that fiery
[2:20:38] experience comes down and lights that
[2:20:41] candle then you haven't received the
[2:20:44] holy ghost you've got to have the
[2:20:47] experience to have the holy ghost that's
[2:20:50] why we believe in a fiery
[2:20:53] experience
[2:20:54] that's what happened on the day of
[2:20:56] pentecost
[2:20:58] amen not when the day of pentecost was
[2:21:00] fully come they come up and shut their
[2:21:02] hands with the preacher and said i
[2:21:03] believe the message
[2:21:05] amen now when the when the day of
[2:21:07] pentecost was fully covered when the
[2:21:09] word was ready to be manifested there
[2:21:12] came a sound from heaven
[2:21:14] come on it didn't come from the preacher
[2:21:18] it didn't come from the songs we were
[2:21:20] singing there was a sound from heaven
[2:21:22] like a rushing mighty wind and it filled
[2:21:25] the house that they were sitting and
[2:21:27] cloven tongues of fire sat down upon
[2:21:30] them and they were filled with the holy
[2:21:32] ghost and began to speak in other
[2:21:34] languages as the spirit gave them
[2:21:36] utterance
[2:21:44] and question answers three do your
[2:21:46] children have to have an experience to
[2:21:47] have the holy spirit
[2:21:49] if they see
[2:21:51] the end time message
[2:21:53] do they have the holy spirit
[2:21:57] everyone must have an experience
[2:22:00] your children cannot go in any other way
[2:22:04] but the same way you do
[2:22:06] they've got to be born into it
[2:22:09] there's no grandchildren in the kingdom
[2:22:11] they're all children they must have it
[2:22:13] you must have an experience with god to
[2:22:15] go in just the same as you
[2:22:18] yeah now brother branham did say in the
[2:22:20] church age book away with experience as
[2:22:23] your measuring line
[2:22:25] and some takes that to mean you don't
[2:22:27] have to have an experience
[2:22:29] but he's not talking about the true
[2:22:31] experience of the holy ghost but the
[2:22:33] experience
[2:22:35] that the 20th century people had when
[2:22:38] the holy ghost fell
[2:22:39] in the
[2:22:40] in on azusa street
[2:22:43] and it fell upon people that were
[2:22:44] justified and sanctified
[2:22:46] and it was there they began an
[2:22:49] unscriptural teaching
[2:22:51] you know that you're first born again by
[2:22:54] believing
[2:22:55] and then you're filled with the holy
[2:22:57] ghost
[2:22:59] now this was a teaching of the assembly
[2:23:01] of god
[2:23:03] you first except the lord is your savior
[2:23:06] and you're born again and then you get
[2:23:08] the holy ghost for added power
[2:23:11] and that was their teaching
[2:23:13] and brother branham said they went on
[2:23:15] experience as a measuring line and not
[2:23:17] the word
[2:23:19] because you see as
[2:23:21] you see
[2:23:22] that it was because people came to be
[2:23:24] filled with the holy ghost
[2:23:26] after they were supposedly been born
[2:23:28] again but the new birth is not complete
[2:23:30] without water blood and spirit
[2:23:34] are you with me so why'd they think they
[2:23:36] were born and didn't feel with the
[2:23:38] spirit how come they didn't understand
[2:23:39] you've got to be born of water blood and
[2:23:41] spirit how come they didn't know
[2:23:42] justification alone is not the new birth
[2:23:44] or justification and sanctification
[2:23:46] alone is not the new birth
[2:23:48] how come they didn't know that
[2:23:51] how come they didn't know that you got
[2:23:53] to have all stages you're begotten of
[2:23:55] god like a child in the womb when you
[2:23:58] believe on the lord you're not born yet
[2:24:01] but you're in the womb you're in the
[2:24:03] womb of the church brother branham tells
[2:24:05] us holy ghost 59 he said you've got to
[2:24:08] protect
[2:24:09] you've got to protect the church from
[2:24:11] the bruises of satan because why he said
[2:24:15] she is with child
[2:24:18] and he said it'll make the bruises of
[2:24:20] satan will make her abort the babies
[2:24:25] and what happens there when trouble
[2:24:26] comes into church
[2:24:29] well what happens when the deacon runs
[2:24:31] off with another woman or preacher does
[2:24:33] what happens when this happens or sin
[2:24:36] that comes in the church or a split
[2:24:38] comes in the body
[2:24:40] amen who is it that gets affected those
[2:24:43] that are justified in sanctified
[2:24:45] but have you ever been sealed in a day
[2:24:47] redemption i don't care what happens
[2:24:49] i don't care what you see i don't care
[2:24:51] what trouble comes i don't care who says
[2:24:54] water what does what or who hurts your
[2:24:56] feelings or what what's how somebody
[2:24:58] acts out or how the preacher fails or
[2:25:00] how the deacons fail or how the church
[2:25:02] fails you're gonna go on
[2:25:05] amen you're president you're sealed to
[2:25:07] the day of redemption you have been born
[2:25:10] you can never be back in the womb again
[2:25:15] but those who are in the development
[2:25:17] stages they're the ones that die
[2:25:23] satan to come along in the division in
[2:25:25] the church
[2:25:29] talk against the pastor and talk against
[2:25:31] the deacons and talk against the members
[2:25:33] and talk against that one
[2:25:36] be careful what you say
[2:25:39] touch not mine anointed
[2:25:41] do my prophets no harm
[2:25:43] some of you need to stretch your mouth
[2:25:47] amen be wise about what you say
[2:25:50] it could be your very own children your
[2:25:52] killing
[2:25:56] are you with me i meant but you got to
[2:25:58] have all stages you're born to get
[2:26:00] begotten of the spirit like a baby's
[2:26:02] begotten in the womb of the mother but
[2:26:04] not born until they receive the holy
[2:26:06] ghost
[2:26:07] you're born in you're not converted
[2:26:09] you're in the process of being converted
[2:26:11] if you don't have the holy ghost you're
[2:26:12] not even converted yet
[2:26:15] you're just in the process of it
[2:26:18] you just started this morning church age
[2:26:21] he said he said now what causes what
[2:26:24] causes thinking he said because the
[2:26:26] answer is experience we went by
[2:26:28] experience and not the word what
[2:26:29] experience the experience of we had
[2:26:32] justified in sanctified people who got
[2:26:34] the holy ghost baptism at azusa street
[2:26:37] so they said okay um by that because of
[2:26:40] that we see people uh are saved and then
[2:26:44] they get the holy ghost
[2:26:48] and that's not what the word teaches
[2:26:51] the word teaches
[2:26:53] the word teaches repent and be baptized
[2:26:56] in the name of jesus christ and you
[2:26:58] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[2:27:01] is that right
[2:27:02] amen the word teaches that to be born
[2:27:05] again you must be born of the water and
[2:27:08] the spirit
[2:27:10] you can't be just begotten and just
[2:27:13] believe on the lord and believe the
[2:27:14] message and believe god sent a prophet
[2:27:16] you've got to have more than that you've
[2:27:18] got to be god yourself
[2:27:21] do you understand what i'm talking about
[2:27:23] some people went on that experience of
[2:27:25] what happened there of
[2:27:27] lutherans and methodists and and
[2:27:29] whatever coming in already saved people
[2:27:32] and get the holy ghost and they went on
[2:27:34] that experience use that before plumb
[2:27:36] line builds a false doctrine and brother
[2:27:38] brandon said it's a false doctrine
[2:27:43] and he said many of these that are
[2:27:45] believable are not going all the way
[2:27:46] into receiving the holy ghost
[2:27:49] and he said he said again he said that's
[2:27:52] what's wrong with our fundamentalists
[2:27:54] they have no power for they stop short
[2:27:56] of pentecost
[2:27:58] amen so let me tell you what every
[2:28:00] experience he's talking about was
[2:28:02] because they had stopped short of
[2:28:04] pentecost they did not get the baptism
[2:28:08] of the holy ghost
[2:28:12] now
[2:28:13] so you see
[2:28:15] there's going to be few that will ever
[2:28:16] believe all the way into receiving the
[2:28:18] spirit of god as again from the church
[2:28:20] age
[2:28:21] this idea
[2:28:23] i want to deal with something just a
[2:28:24] minute i wanted to want to get a lot
[2:28:27] deeper into this than i did
[2:28:29] but this idea that you're saved one day
[2:28:32] and lost the next
[2:28:35] is an
[2:28:36] azusa pentecostal teacher
[2:28:41] one day you're
[2:28:43] a horse
[2:28:45] the next day you're back a donkey again
[2:28:49] that's mule religion
[2:28:51] you don't know what you are
[2:28:53] that's not to do birth
[2:28:55] that's a form of godliness that denies
[2:28:57] the power
[2:28:59] are you with me amen when you are sealed
[2:29:02] you are sealed to the day of redemption
[2:29:06] and the holy spirit inspects you
[2:29:09] just like
[2:29:11] the inspecting of a railroad railway car
[2:29:14] he inspects you to first to see if
[2:29:17] there's anything loose
[2:29:21] amen and then when he finds that
[2:29:23] everything's in order
[2:29:26] in other words your temper's been
[2:29:27] sanctified your habits have been
[2:29:29] cleansed
[2:29:31] you cannot get the holy ghost and still
[2:29:33] smoking and drinking and pornography you
[2:29:35] can't do it
[2:29:36] you've got to die to sin
[2:29:40] in order to get the holy ghost are you
[2:29:42] with me
[2:29:43] amen so you know a lot of people are
[2:29:45] thinking well you know well here he
[2:29:47] packs the
[2:29:48] the real car we get down the road it all
[2:29:50] breaks apart no he never sealed the car
[2:29:54] he never approved you for the journey
[2:29:57] if you listen listen let me tell you
[2:29:59] there's too many churches that are not
[2:30:02] preaching a sin cure
[2:30:05] they are preaching and they are
[2:30:07] treatment centers for sin
[2:30:10] so therefore they're with psychology and
[2:30:12] with the you know
[2:30:14] admonitions and counseling whatever they
[2:30:17] try to deal with sin that's not the way
[2:30:19] to deal with sin the way to deal with
[2:30:21] sin is a new birth where you try out to
[2:30:24] sin where you're born again by the
[2:30:26] spirit of god amen that's the way to
[2:30:28] deal with sin
[2:30:32] it it ain't what is it
[2:30:34] means what 19 steps i don't know what it
[2:30:36] is i've never been to one thank god
[2:30:40] never drank in my life
[2:30:41] but nevertheless you know here here
[2:30:43] again you know they have all these steps
[2:30:46] you do this and now you do that and then
[2:30:48] you don't do this and you do that and
[2:30:50] then you talk with one another you know
[2:30:52] and you report to one another and you
[2:30:54] know keep everybody on track you know
[2:30:56] say about your buddy over here and help
[2:30:58] him you know because with his addiction
[2:31:00] and you know you always have the problem
[2:31:02] you always are going to be an alcoholic
[2:31:05] you are never cured
[2:31:08] we're just going to teach you how to
[2:31:09] deal with that don't ever think you're
[2:31:11] cured
[2:31:13] you see that that's the problem that we
[2:31:15] have today that with churches they have
[2:31:18] become treatment centers
[2:31:23] and some of them are good programs i'm
[2:31:24] not saying they're not
[2:31:26] you know some of them the promise
[2:31:28] keepers program where you promise and
[2:31:31] sign pledges i'll be true to my wife
[2:31:34] i'll love her and love her only and i'll
[2:31:36] take her out on dates and i'll do this
[2:31:38] and i'll do that and i'll keep my
[2:31:40] marriage vitalized
[2:31:42] you see promise keepers when you see
[2:31:45] promises get broken
[2:31:48] amen in the time listen listen david
[2:31:52] said thy word have i hid in my heart
[2:31:55] he had he had read the word and he had
[2:31:57] memorized the word
[2:31:59] he said it's in the frontlines of my
[2:32:01] eyes and i've got it on my doorpost
[2:32:04] amen but brother he went right beyond
[2:32:06] all of that when he saw bathsheba
[2:32:09] all of a sudden the frontlines
[2:32:10] disappeared he couldn't see that no more
[2:32:12] he didn't see what he said in the
[2:32:14] commandments he didn't i'm the king and
[2:32:16] i can have her and he overruled
[2:32:18] everything with reasoning
[2:32:21] and let me tell you that's what you will
[2:32:23] do
[2:32:23] [Music]
[2:32:25] amen i want you to understand the new
[2:32:27] birth is not a reformation it's a
[2:32:29] transformation
[2:32:31] it ain't i've decided and i'm making up
[2:32:34] my mind it ain't that at all it is you
[2:32:36] get a new mind
[2:32:38] you hate sin like god hates sin
[2:32:41] amen listen we don't preach in this
[2:32:43] church a sin treatment we are not a
[2:32:46] treatment center for sin we preach a sin
[2:32:50] cure
[2:32:51] hallelujah people are arguing about the
[2:32:53] vaccine let me tell you the vaccine you
[2:32:56] better get
[2:32:57] something the other is the mark of the
[2:32:59] beast it ain't
[2:33:00] but i'll tell you some people got that
[2:33:02] idea in their mind that's the mark of
[2:33:04] the beast the mark of the means is to
[2:33:06] reject the seal of god to reject the
[2:33:08] holy ghost is to take the mark of the
[2:33:10] beast you're either marked with god or
[2:33:13] your markless sin
[2:33:16] hallelujah you're either taking one mark
[2:33:18] on the other mark
[2:33:21] but i tell you there is a people of god
[2:33:23] that has the seal of god amen it's the
[2:33:26] seal of god not just in their forehead
[2:33:29] it's in their heart it's clear it
[2:33:31] carries them when they're going it's on
[2:33:32] the backside it's on the front side
[2:33:35] you don't have to preach don't look at
[2:33:37] women don't watch television don't go to
[2:33:40] movies don't wear short dresses don't do
[2:33:42] this and don't do that that's a law
[2:33:45] we're not under the law
[2:33:47] amen we have the holy spirit and the
[2:33:49] cause of holy spirit
[2:33:51] it's a nature and we hate sin we hate
[2:33:54] wickedness we're offended we're offended
[2:33:57] and evil
[2:34:02] you see it's a sin kill
[2:34:12] i can today there was a need for cure
[2:34:14] for smallpox
[2:34:16] they couldn't find the cure
[2:34:18] fact of the matter is
[2:34:20] my ancestry
[2:34:22] i'd have to go back and find out the
[2:34:24] name now
[2:34:25] but one of my great great great great
[2:34:27] great great grandfathers back there
[2:34:29] was working on a cure
[2:34:31] for false smallpox
[2:34:34] and he learned
[2:34:36] to take cow pox
[2:34:38] now he he he wasn't he wasn't the man
[2:34:40] they accredited for it but it's still
[2:34:42] part of history
[2:34:44] and he he did some of the first
[2:34:46] experimentals
[2:34:47] of taking cow pox
[2:34:50] or something like that and and trying it

[2:38:01] believe the message
[2:38:06] it's an experience you get with god
[2:38:11] and it bursts you by the word
[2:38:13] supernaturally
[2:38:15] not intellectually
[2:38:24] and you're not saved one day
[2:38:27] i lost the next
[2:38:30] i had
[2:38:31] an older cousin a year older
[2:38:33] i was a boy
[2:38:36] he was in the upc
[2:38:40] i heard he got the holy ghost
[2:38:42] i said text
[2:38:44] heard you got the holy ghost
[2:38:47] i heard last night you got the holy
[2:38:49] ghost
[2:38:50] he looked at me real sadly he said yeah
[2:38:53] but i've already lost it
[2:38:59] that's not the new birth from now not a
[2:39:01] count forward
[2:39:02] it seals you to the day of redemption
[2:39:10] everything your temper
[2:39:13] your habits the world it all gets
[2:39:16] in place
[2:39:19] where that when you do have a trial
[2:39:22] because along the journey
[2:39:24] you're going to have ups and downs
[2:39:27] you're going to have with banging
[2:39:29] together the cars you know
[2:39:31] jostling along the road and sometimes
[2:39:34] there's
[2:39:35] wrecks along the way but if the car has
[2:39:38] been packed
[2:39:40] and sealed by the holy ghost
[2:39:43] it don't break loose on the journey
[2:39:49] hallelujah are you with me church
[2:39:51] amen it's like in the days and in the
[2:39:53] days where they had a cannon here and
[2:39:55] i'm running over time you can come on
[2:39:57] musicians
[2:39:58] but in the days of the
[2:40:00] of this of the shipping
[2:40:02] where they had ships
[2:40:04] they would have to have a
[2:40:06] big old cam a cannon
[2:40:08] it would be on wheels
[2:40:10] well because it's heavy maybe weigh a
[2:40:13] ton or two
[2:40:14] big metal cast iron huge
[2:40:18] balls and there they would have it maybe
[2:40:21] that ship would only have one cannon
[2:40:27] and that cannon would have to be moved
[2:40:29] from side to side when you know because
[2:40:31] you couldn't turn the ship around
[2:40:33] quickly so they would take the cannon
[2:40:35] and run it to the other side
[2:40:37] to face an opponent on the other side
[2:40:39] when pirates were coming along
[2:40:43] the ship was in danger and they needed
[2:40:45] that cannon there to ward off
[2:40:47] to show we got a weapon
[2:40:55] and the cannoneer was a man who had a
[2:40:57] charge and his charge was
[2:40:59] to keep the cannon secure
[2:41:02] he was over the cannon
[2:41:06] now there's a lot of things in your life
[2:41:10] that is a cannon
[2:41:14] god gives you a temper
[2:41:17] i said god gives you a temper
[2:41:20] it causes you to have a backbone
[2:41:22] temper is such a good thing you should
[2:41:24] never lose it
[2:41:34] but if it ever gets loose
[2:41:37] it will destroy your family
[2:41:40] it'll ruin your marriage
[2:41:42] it'll harm your kids
[2:41:44] erect the church
[2:41:46] it'll destroy your friends it'll destroy
[2:41:48] you
[2:41:51] god gave you sexual passion he said i'm
[2:41:55] going to permit for this to come this
[2:41:56] way but it gave a way to channel it and
[2:42:00] that's through marriage
[2:42:02] marriage is honorable and the bed is
[2:42:04] undefiled
[2:42:06] but whoremongers and adulterers god will
[2:42:08] judge
[2:42:09] and passion is a wonderful thing if it's
[2:42:12] aimed in the right direction
[2:42:14] toward a mate
[2:42:15] and loving and giving affection to your
[2:42:18] mate
[2:42:19] passion is a wonderful thing
[2:42:22] but
[2:42:23] if it gets loose
[2:42:25] and aimed in the wrong direction
[2:42:28] it can break up your home
[2:42:30] your family
[2:42:32] your children
[2:42:35] your church
[2:42:38] it can hurt your pastor
[2:42:42] there's all kinds of things
[2:42:45] that when you come to new birth
[2:42:47] you've got to get tied down first
[2:42:53] well this cannon here
[2:42:54] had a job his job was to secure the
[2:42:57] cannon
[2:42:58] tend to it
[2:43:00] make sure it was tied down
[2:43:02] you know and he got irresponsible
[2:43:05] and there was a storm came well i mean
[2:43:09] you've got this
[2:43:10] 1500 pound 2 000 pound cannon
[2:43:13] and now in this storm it's rolling back
[2:43:16] and forth
[2:43:17] and it's rolling to one side the other
[2:43:19] and it's crashing in here and it's
[2:43:21] running over men and it's breaking legs
[2:43:25] and it's saying it's breaking into the
[2:43:27] sides and it's about causing the whole
[2:43:29] ship to wreck
[2:43:32] because a man didn't secure the cannon
[2:43:45] finally
[2:43:47] wrestling that men getting hurt maimed
[2:43:51] and got the cannon in place and tied it
[2:43:53] down
[2:43:55] storm settled
[2:44:00] the ship is devastated men are dead
[2:44:04] people are crippled
[2:44:06] harmed
[2:44:08] and the cannoneer
[2:44:10] has to walk the plank
[2:44:20] the time down is the holy ghost
[2:44:25] it is the tie post
[2:44:27] that ties those things in place
[2:44:31] you were born with certain things in
[2:44:32] your life
[2:44:34] qualities that are there
[2:44:36] that are misused the devil will use them
[2:44:39] and destroy with
[2:44:49] get it tight now
[2:44:50] i want you to bow your hands for a
[2:44:52] moment
[2:45:00] i've seen loose cannons get a hold of
[2:45:01] preachers destroyed churches
[2:45:06] young people fall away
[2:45:09] this man who they thought was such a
[2:45:11] great christian
[2:45:15] drugs sex homosexual all kinds of evil
[2:45:18] things
[2:45:19] he can't make it i can't make it
[2:45:22] don't make man your example look back to
[2:45:24] the word
[2:45:26] look back to the prophecy there's going
[2:45:28] to be a people born of the word
[2:45:32] a people that are truly born again
[2:45:35] not born of a church
[2:45:37] born of christ
[2:45:41] i just want to i want you just to think
[2:45:43] it over just for a moment
[2:45:45] maybe in your life that you can see
[2:45:47] there's still something loose
[2:45:52] maybe it's an evil tongue
[2:45:57] maybe there's something been destroyed
[2:45:58] in your marriage you can't love you
[2:46:00] can't care
[2:46:02] you can't
[2:46:04] you you can't express it
[2:46:08] you don't know how
[2:46:11] well i tell you just get the love of god
[2:46:12] in your heart to make you love everybody
[2:46:14] you should make you love your family
[2:46:16] that's the holy ghost
[2:46:20] maybe it's something else
[2:46:29] he said well brother tim i'm one of
[2:46:30] those saved today and lost tomorrow i
[2:46:32] don't know where i stand
[2:46:34] you don't have to stay that way
[2:46:42] now this message didn't go quite the way
[2:46:44] i thought it would either
[2:46:45] i had a lot more things i wanted to get
[2:46:47] into today
[2:46:50] but you see i'm not my own boss
[2:46:55] i have to speak as the unction comes
[2:46:59] i never was trained to be a preacher
[2:47:01] thank god
[2:47:05] except by the holy ghost
[2:47:11] i started out
[2:47:13] 52 years ago
[2:47:16] there at blocker's chapel preaching a
[2:47:18] sermon
[2:47:20] about the insincerity of the people they
[2:47:23] sat down to eat and they rose up to play
[2:47:26] because of this god
[2:47:28] was displeased and overthrew them in the
[2:47:30] wilderness
[2:47:32] yet they drive from the rock
[2:47:35] yet they were under the cloud yet they
[2:47:37] went through the red sea
[2:47:39] [Music]
[2:47:42] but with many of them god was displeased
[2:47:45] [Music]
[2:47:46] i must wonder today where you are in
[2:47:48] your spiritual walk
[2:47:51] is there something loose
[2:47:55] because i've been seeking the holy ghost
[2:47:56] well
[2:48:00] once you deal with the loose things
[2:48:03] won't you just give up that pride i want
[2:48:05] you to surrender that to the heart of
[2:48:07] god
[2:48:09] once you give up that worldliness that
[2:48:11] sin that besetting sin
[2:48:14] give it up make a full surrenderance of
[2:48:17] your life
[2:48:20] the token
[2:48:22] why you could plaster your house with
[2:48:24] tapes
[2:48:26] you put books everywhere
[2:48:28] over in africa they
[2:48:30] when they build a house and put a spoken
[2:48:32] word book at the doorsteps
[2:48:35] bury it under the foundation
[2:48:37] keep demons out
[2:48:39] you put books anywhere and put books all
[2:48:41] over you they don't save you that's not
[2:48:43] what savior it's the holy ghost
[2:48:46] it's the supernatural presence of the
[2:48:48] almighty god coming down into you and
[2:48:51] changing you
[2:48:52] that's what changes
[2:48:56] you the books and tapes are wonderful we
[2:48:59] need them we should have them
[2:49:02] and yeah i think if you feast on them
[2:49:04] you should
[2:49:06] we do
[2:49:08] we make it available to every one of you
[2:49:11] encourage you to hear it all the time
[2:49:14] read your bible too
[2:49:18] do all of those things but you can do
[2:49:19] the same thing with bibles
[2:49:21] you put bibles on
[2:49:23] on a dead man it won't raise him up
[2:49:26] you bury it with him
[2:49:28] you can plaster yourself with bibles
[2:49:32] you can take a bible and put it on a
[2:49:34] demonic man it won't cast the devil out
[2:49:36] of him
[2:49:38] but you can take that bible in a
[2:49:39] preacher or in a man of god in my name
[2:49:42] have cast out devils
[2:49:44] i've seen it happen
[2:49:46] i know it happens
[2:49:52] you see it ain't the external
[2:49:55] it's the internal
[2:49:57] it ain't what you can do with works
[2:50:00] it's what you can do what the
[2:50:02] supernatural god does in you it isn't
[2:50:05] you making yourself new it's a new
[2:50:07] creature
