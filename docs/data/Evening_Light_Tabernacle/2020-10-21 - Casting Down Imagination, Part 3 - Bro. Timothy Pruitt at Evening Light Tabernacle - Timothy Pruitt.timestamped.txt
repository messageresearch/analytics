[27:09] and amen turn our bibles to second
[27:11] corinthians
[27:13] 10 and verse 3 and also isaiah 55 and
[27:16] verse 8
[27:18] amen
[27:23] it says for though we walk in the flesh
[27:26] we do not war after the flesh for the
[27:29] weapons of our warfare are not
[27:31] carnal but mighty through god to the
[27:34] pulling down
[27:34] of strongholds casting down imaginations
[27:39] and every high thing that exalted itself
[27:41] against the knowledge of god
[27:43] and bringing into captivity every
[27:46] thought
[27:47] to the obedience of christ also isaiah
[27:50] 55 and verse 8 says for my thoughts
[27:54] are not your thoughts neither are my
[27:56] ways
[27:57] your ways my ways saith the lord
[28:00] for as the heavens are higher than the
[28:02] earth so are my
[28:04] ways higher than your ways and my
[28:07] thoughts
[28:08] than your thoughts amen let you be
[28:11] seated this evening
[28:12] i speak to you again on casting down
[28:15] imaginations
[28:16] you know i would i would just dare to
[28:19] say
[28:19] that there's probably not a person in
[28:22] this building
[28:23] that would want every thought that you
[28:25] had this week posted up here
[28:27] today or even maybe the last hour put up
[28:30] here today
[28:31] because we have things that comes
[28:33] through our minds and
[28:35] and you know brother branham would speak
[28:36] about it as a bird that would fly over
[28:38] your head you
[28:39] you could fly over your head but you can
[28:42] you can't keep it from doing that but
[28:43] you can keep it from building the nest
[28:45] and so you know brother brandon was
[28:47] actually asked a question about thoughts
[28:49] and about thinking
[28:50] he said brother adam please explain how
[28:53] a person knows
[28:54] if he's thinking his own thoughts or if
[28:57] the devil
[28:58] is placing thoughts in his mind to make
[29:00] him think wrong
[29:01] especially if you know you don't want to
[29:04] thank them
[29:05] he said if it's contrary to the word
[29:08] it's the devil's thinking
[29:13] amen so all those things you've been
[29:15] battling with that wasn't your thoughts
[29:16] that was the devil's thoughts
[29:18] if it's contrary to the word it's the
[29:20] devil's thinking
[29:22] if it's with the word it's god's
[29:24] thinking
[29:25] if it's wrong thoughts it's the devil if
[29:28] it's good
[29:28] thoughts of the word or of god it's
[29:31] god's thinking
[29:32] and i believe that's what we want today
[29:34] is god's thinking
[29:35] and so i believe to have god's thinking
[29:38] you have to think what god thinks
[29:40] and what god thinks is his word amen
[29:42] that is his
[29:43] written express thoughts of god written
[29:45] on paper for us to pull
[29:47] strength from in the hour or the battles
[29:49] that we're going through
[29:51] but we see here you know i was actually
[29:53] looking at some things and thinking
[29:54] man's filter today
[29:56] because brother branham is an
[29:57] interesting way that he received that
[29:59] sermon as he was walking in the very
[30:01] woods
[30:02] there where the squirrels were created
[30:04] he was walking there and he
[30:05] he said he saw a cigarette pack laying
[30:08] there and something told him to go back
[30:10] and look at it again and he went back
[30:11] and looked at it
[30:12] and it was a slogan on there that he
[30:14] would preach a
[30:16] amazing message from and pull from it
[30:18] many times throughout
[30:19] a couple of time more times throughout
[30:21] the last few years of his life
[30:23] on thinking man's filter and the slogan
[30:26] was a thinking man's filter
[30:28] and a smoking man's tastes and he would
[30:30] begin to talk about how that
[30:32] in that sermon as i would look at it
[30:34] today he began to talk about how men
[30:36] take other things and they begin to all
[30:38] right you know how they would put a
[30:40] filter he said
[30:41] you know up on a cigarette and then he
[30:42] said what was it he said there's nothing
[30:44] but a gimmick to make people smoke more
[30:46] cigarettes
[30:47] and he said well it was a you know put
[30:49] there as a gimmick because you're still
[30:51] taking in the the the tar you're still
[30:54] taking in the nicotine
[30:55] it's only there to sell more he said it
[30:57] was actually the
[30:59] the man's mind and their greed for more
[31:02] money
[31:02] to put that upon there and a trick of
[31:04] the devil amen to talk people in the
[31:06] smokings more cigarettes more cigarettes
[31:08] more cancer
[31:09] more diseases more this and that and the
[31:11] other he said but you know what man he
[31:13] said well
[31:14] he said there's other things that's even
[31:15] worse he talks about sin and
[31:18] he goes into all kinds of things and he
[31:19] said but there's only one thing
[31:21] that you can bring your thoughts to a
[31:23] real thinking man or a real man
[31:26] will bring their thoughts through the
[31:27] word of god and through the word of god
[31:30] then you can breathe in the
[31:32] thoughts of god and what god thinks of
[31:34] you and how he how he what he thinks of
[31:36] you and what he
[31:37] is determined you know he's in the
[31:39] scripture he said god said i know the
[31:41] thoughts
[31:42] that i think of you amen they're of good
[31:44] and not of evil
[31:46] amen there to have an expected end god
[31:48] has thoughts of you
[31:50] and they're not evil thoughts and i'm
[31:51] thankful tonight that god's thoughts
[31:53] don't change
[31:54] like man's thoughts change you know my
[31:56] man's thoughts you can think one thing
[31:58] one day in the next few hours think
[32:00] another thing
[32:01] and we get you know and go waffle back
[32:03] and forth but when god thinks something
[32:05] or when he first thought it
[32:06] it stays that way when he first thought
[32:08] of you in his mind
[32:09] no matter what's went on here on earth
[32:11] no matter how the devil has come against
[32:13] you and
[32:14] tormented you and brought you in
[32:15] different avenues and different things
[32:17] of your life
[32:18] that still did not change god's thinking
[32:20] you said well i got into drinking i got
[32:22] into this that and still did not change
[32:24] god's thinking
[32:25] amen what i got i got this sickness that
[32:27] still does not change god's thinking
[32:29] god's thoughts of you are always the
[32:31] same
[32:32] and i'm thankful to serve that kind of
[32:33] god i i don't know where we would be if
[32:36] god's thoughts changed of us
[32:38] if one day we thought was he thought we
[32:40] saved or the next day where he wasn't
[32:42] but if god ever had you in his mind
[32:44] and he did before the foundation of the
[32:46] world and he had a picture of you in his
[32:48] mind
[32:49] in his mind that picture's never changed
[32:52] even though sin has come and sickness
[32:54] has come
[32:54] and old ages come that picture he had of
[32:57] you and his mind
[32:58] has never changed but many times we
[33:01] begin to change because of
[33:03] of our own thinking our own thoughts and
[33:05] we begin to filter in
[33:06] other man's creeds or other man's ideas
[33:09] or even the devil's thinking comes into
[33:10] our mind
[33:11] and we begin to filter our own what we
[33:14] do or how we act
[33:15] through those filters but there's only
[33:17] one filter a christian needs tonight and
[33:19] that is the word of god
[33:21] if you can take the word of god and
[33:23] believe breathe in the thoughts of god
[33:25] then by his stripes you're healed amen
[33:27] by his stripes you're delivered if you
[33:29] could pull that in tonight
[33:31] it'll be it'll it'll produce something
[33:33] in your life amen and we know
[33:35] uh you know brother brown will talk
[33:37] about positive thinking and he would
[33:38] talk about
[33:39] positive thinking just positive thinking
[33:41] don't work but if you would take that
[33:43] and turn it upon and put that thinking
[33:45] towards the word of god that's what
[33:48] works
[33:48] and he talks about the right mental
[33:50] attitude he said if you could just take
[33:52] that right mental attitude towards any
[33:55] divine promise you watch it materialize
[33:58] no matter how impossible it looks if god
[34:02] said it he makes it possible
[34:05] hallelujah he said if you take the right
[34:07] mental attitude towards any divine
[34:09] promise
[34:10] god is made it'll come to pass if you'll
[34:12] just simply say
[34:14] it's god's word how many can say that
[34:16] tonight it's god's word
[34:18] amen it's not for me to try to figure it
[34:20] out that's god's business how he brings
[34:23] it to the past
[34:24] he spoke it and that's all that's
[34:26] necessary
[34:27] something will take place hallelujah
[34:30] he says the word of god written in the
[34:32] bible is his word to us and every
[34:34] promise
[34:35] has the same power of creation behind it
[34:39] that's what god's word had at the
[34:41] beginning every promise still has
[34:43] that same power of creation behind it
[34:46] and he said if we believe it to be the
[34:48] word of god he said it depends on where
[34:51] the seed falls he said
[34:52] it's if it falls into a ground a ground
[34:55] that has moisture or a nourishment
[34:58] around the promise of god
[35:00] it'll bring forth every promise the
[35:02] bible has
[35:04] amen i want that kind of mind tonight i
[35:07] want
[35:07] my mind to be able to come in under
[35:09] under the influence of the holy ghost
[35:11] that when the word of god falls there
[35:13] it will create the atmosphere it will
[35:16] create the moisture
[35:17] it will create the nourishment to bring
[35:19] it to pass
[35:20] amen and that's what we have to have he
[35:22] said why the right mental attitude
[35:25] towards any divine promise of god
[35:27] will bring it to pass if you just look
[35:29] at it and take care of the word just
[35:32] right
[35:32] because the infinite god spoke it it's
[35:35] god's word
[35:36] and it will come to pass hallelujah but
[35:40] it takes somebody with some
[35:42] with something about them to say yes
[35:43] lord i believe it's your word
[35:45] i believe your words for me and i'm
[35:47] going to breathe in your word tonight
[35:49] i'm going to breathe in the word of god
[35:51] i'm going to quit
[35:52] breathing in my doubts and and my fears
[35:55] and my anxieties
[35:56] and my worries i'm going to drink in
[35:58] from the word of god
[36:00] and let that word be born in my heart
[36:03] amen and that's what it takes he said if
[36:05] he says you know here's another question
[36:07] as we go into this he said
[36:09] the case may be the devil is placing
[36:12] your
[36:12] thoughts in your mind about a certain
[36:14] thing and this is a question he said if
[36:16] the case may be
[36:17] that the devil is placing thoughts in
[36:19] your mind about a certain thing
[36:21] how may it be overcome or got rid of
[36:26] he said you take the very opposite of it
[36:30] amen if the devil makes you think he
[36:33] said if you know you're a christian
[36:34] but he tries to make you think you're
[36:36] not a christian
[36:37] take the very opposite and say i am a
[36:40] christian
[36:42] as long as your experience matches god's
[36:45] word
[36:45] say i am a christian and anything else
[36:49] the same way
[36:51] so if he tries to make you think there's
[36:53] no hope for you
[36:54] you tell him my hope is in jesus christ
[36:58] if he tries to make you think that
[36:59] there's this word is not for you
[37:01] you tell him the word is for me he said
[37:04] it and i believe it
[37:06] hallelujah he said see and anything he
[37:08] said see god grant your overcoming
[37:10] whoever you are
[37:12] may your thoughts go right back to the
[37:14] other side
[37:15] and say i'm a christian i'm a believer
[37:18] satan you have no hold on me
[37:22] hallelujah i wonder how many can say
[37:24] that tonight
[37:25] amen i'm a christian i'm a believer
[37:29] and satan you have no hold on me
[37:34] hallelujah he said frankly i'm standing
[37:37] right here
[37:38] saying the same thing
[37:41] he said because i'm fainting right here
[37:43] in the pulpit four or five times i've
[37:45] almost pitched over that's the truth
[37:47] why because of thoughts
[37:51] the devil trying to put thoughts in a
[37:53] prophet's mind
[37:57] mercy but the first thing you have to do
[38:01] is you have to surrender yourself
[38:03] entirely to christ surrender your mind
[38:06] to his word
[38:08] lord i won't act on my own feelings no
[38:10] more
[38:11] well that'll solve a lot of problems
[38:12] right there
[38:14] amen i won't act upon my own thoughts
[38:17] i will only act upon your word
[38:21] amen i will act upon your word
[38:24] it's not you're not to go down and say
[38:26] well i you know i lost my healing if you
[38:28] do
[38:29] it'll be worse than you ever was don't
[38:32] ever say that
[38:33] you stand right there upon the word of
[38:36] god
[38:36] and make that committal lord god of
[38:39] heaven
[38:39] i'll stand by my what your word so help
[38:42] me
[38:42] till the last drop of blood is left in
[38:45] my
[38:46] body or i breathe my last breath
[38:49] oh hallelujah the devil won't know what
[38:51] to do with a person that'll stand there
[38:53] no matter what he puts against them
[38:57] listen i've seen people face
[38:58] insurmountable odds and i thought how in
[39:01] the world
[39:01] are they standing there they wasn't
[39:03] standing there by their own power
[39:04] they couldn't have no more power left
[39:06] they had no more human strength left
[39:08] they had no more human ability left but
[39:10] they were standing upon a word
[39:13] and it wasn't just a word of a mortal
[39:15] man it was the word of almighty god
[39:17] that said let there be
[39:21] and that's where the bride is standing
[39:22] tonight we're not standing upon a word
[39:24] of a kentuckian preacher
[39:26] we're not standing on the word of some
[39:27] theologian we're not standing on the
[39:29] word of this church
[39:30] we're standing upon the unadulterated
[39:32] word of almighty god
[39:35] and he said i will have a bride without
[39:38] spot without wrinkle
[39:39] and that's where we're standing
[39:43] he said it
[39:49] hope you're this kind of group here
[39:50] tonight he said here sits
[39:52] a group tonight waiting
[39:55] under great anticipation
[39:58] i believe we ought to come to every
[40:00] service in anticipation
[40:02] amen every day not just a church we
[40:05] ought to be anticipating every day for
[40:07] god to do something
[40:09] amen he said i hear sets a group of
[40:12] people
[40:13] right now setting waiting
[40:16] under great anticipation
[40:19] but satan if he can interrupt your mind
[40:24] that's all he has to do
[40:29] wow
[40:32] and it don't have to be necessarily a
[40:34] bad thought
[40:38] come on now he can get you thinking
[40:40] about tomorrow or thinking about
[40:42] yesterday or
[40:43] thinking about today any and they're not
[40:46] thinking sinful thoughts
[40:48] some may be but not everybody amen i
[40:50] hope not
[40:52] thinking sinful thoughts just everyday
[40:54] thinking what is he doing he's trying to
[40:56] interrupt your thinking
[40:58] interrupt your focus interrupt amen what
[41:00] god is doing
[41:02] i've seen it happen you know brother
[41:04] brown would call it out he said what
[41:06] happened
[41:06] he said that woman's missed it he said
[41:08] why because the devil came and
[41:10] interrupted her or he'd say some other
[41:11] word but the devil would come and move
[41:14] and it would interrupt what was going on
[41:15] and she would miss what god was doing
[41:17] or he would miss what god was doing
[41:19] listen we ought to be well
[41:21] every time especially when we come to
[41:23] the house of god
[41:24] well to lay aside everything i mean just
[41:27] lay aside tomorrow let tomorrow take
[41:29] care of itself well i got this plan and
[41:31] i got to go do this and i still got to
[41:33] do this and i and we got a whole list of
[41:35] to do and all these things
[41:37] and before we know it the service has
[41:38] come and gone and god moved and we
[41:40] missed it
[41:42] why did satan interrupted our thinking
[41:46] he interrupted our thoughts he found a
[41:48] little spot there to grab your attention
[41:50] and meanwhile the angel was passing
[41:52] right by
[41:54] come on somebody amen it's time we focus
[41:57] in
[41:57] if there ever got to be a people that's
[41:59] focused into what god's doing
[42:01] it ought to be this people in this day
[42:03] because we're coming right down to the
[42:05] very end
[42:07] we're coming right down the last mile
[42:09] the last hill
[42:11] the last valley the last trial the last
[42:14] sickness
[42:15] the last demons of hell the last moments
[42:18] upon this earth
[42:19] we ought to be focused here and saying
[42:21] god i don't want to miss a moment with
[42:23] you
[42:25] i don't want to miss it when you're
[42:26] raising the dead among you
[42:28] you're healing the sick and you're
[42:30] delivering you're setting free
[42:32] i don't want to miss a moment
[42:41] what has to happen you got to give god's
[42:43] word
[42:44] first place
[42:47] amen
[42:52] i wish i had spoke to me today or in the
[42:55] last couple of days i've seen it
[42:56] somebody shared it with me talking about
[42:59] how a holy ghost feel
[43:00] person brother brown said can sit hour
[43:03] after hour and drink in that word
[43:12] why because you're focused on something
[43:20] you know i i i know every one of you has
[43:23] watched the film or something maybe
[43:25] whatever whatever kind of film hope it's
[43:27] been a godly film but
[43:28] you know you get to that punch line and
[43:31] somebody wants to come talk to you and
[43:32] you realize
[43:33] if i don't catch this i'm gonna miss
[43:34] what's going on or you know
[43:36] it's something and and and all of a
[43:39] sudden something can happen you're like
[43:40] wait a minute what happened
[43:43] how did that how did that happen i
[43:45] missed it there's going to be a lot of
[43:47] people that's going to come to a moment
[43:48] and say you know what
[43:49] i missed it
[43:52] because the devil interrupted their
[43:54] thinking and it wasn't
[43:56] all on sinful things
[44:01] think about those excuses that came to
[44:03] go i don't know why we're going here but
[44:04] we're going
[44:04] think about those excuses that were
[44:06] given to go to the
[44:08] to the marriage supper wasn't
[44:10] necessarily sinful things
[44:12] it was an ox or it was a land or it was
[44:14] this or that the other
[44:15] it was everyday life
[44:17] [Applause]
[44:20] come on somebody all the devil has to do
[44:24] in a service
[44:24] is interrupt your thinking and then the
[44:28] preacher can preach 30 minutes and
[44:29] you've been off somewhere else for 30
[44:31] minutes and you missed it
[44:35] and you might have missed your
[44:36] visitation
[44:42] this is why and i okay i'm the system
[44:44] pastor here so i can say this
[44:46] this is why it's important that when it
[44:48] comes down to the end of the service
[44:50] that you really start tuning in
[44:54] i think the time to get up to go to the
[44:55] bathroom that ain't the time to go wash
[44:57] your hands
[44:58] or think about this or think about that
[45:00] tune in because the holy spirit has
[45:01] fallen among the people
[45:04] and you don't want to miss your
[45:05] visitation
[45:08] brother so-and-so may still get his but
[45:10] you might miss yours
[45:11] and it may never come back
[45:14] come on somebody it's time that we
[45:17] realize satan
[45:18] is trying to interrupt our thinking
[45:21] trying to interrupt our thoughts it
[45:23] ain't so much about this and that and
[45:24] the other
[45:25] sinful things but everyday life
[45:34] give god's word first place
[45:43] that's what was a statement in the
[45:44] greatest battle ever fought
[45:46] give god's word first place
[45:49] a man cannot sin until first
[45:52] he cast aside god's word
[45:56] he can't sin until he cast away and
[45:59] that's disbelief
[46:00] until first he gets rid of the word of
[46:03] god the presence of god
[46:05] he cannot sin eve could not see it until
[46:08] she laid aside
[46:09] god's word and are we not seeing that in
[46:13] the day we're living
[46:14] in today but aaron just sent me the
[46:16] thing today the pope come out and said
[46:17] talks about how the homosexuals are now
[46:20] accepted
[46:23] they're all god's children
[46:26] they're smoking through a different
[46:27] filter
[46:33] they're smoking through the filter of
[46:34] hell
[46:36] no other word no wonder the bible would
[46:38] call her the mother
[46:39] and her harlot daughters and she'll burn
[46:42] with unquenchable fire
[46:44] amen why because they have taken the
[46:46] word of god and they laid it aside
[46:48] and took man's thinking
[46:52] amen we don't want man thinking we want
[46:54] god thinking
[46:56] i don't want man seeking him in my own
[46:58] life everyday life i want god's sake
[47:01] i don't want my thinking
[47:07] one little iota of god's word disbelief
[47:11] caused all the trouble that we're having
[47:13] now
[47:14] how's it going to get back by still
[47:16] disbelieving god's word no
[47:18] it's you'll have it's gonna have to shut
[47:19] off all those same
[47:21] shut off memories shut off conscience
[47:24] shut off reasons and ain't that what the
[47:26] devil loves to do he loves to bring back
[47:28] memories
[47:31] especially bad memories and faults and
[47:33] failures
[47:34] and try to bring all that back up but
[47:36] you wouldn't have done this if you was a
[47:37] christian
[47:38] or you wouldn't have done this if you
[47:39] was there you went yeah
[47:44] cast down reasonings cast it all
[47:47] it's accept the word upon this basis
[47:51] god said so and if god said so
[47:55] and you accept it it puts a channel
[47:57] between you and god
[47:59] that god can operate in that god can
[48:02] move in
[48:03] that god can become and do something for
[48:06] you in
[48:07] he said you can't come through reasoning
[48:13] you can't come through all these other
[48:14] things you say well if i could just feel
[48:16] it it ain't about feeling it
[48:19] it ain't about i could smell it or if i
[48:21] could taste it ain't nothing about that
[48:23] well it looks like it ought to know you
[48:24] know the doctor said this look like they
[48:26] ought to know what they're talking about
[48:28] amen but they're what are the who says
[48:30] the doctor's right
[48:36] he said what is it all of those thoughts
[48:39] is just the devil standing there
[48:42] the devil trying to poke something into
[48:44] you
[48:45] trying to get you to disbelieve god's
[48:47] word oh but god's word said
[48:49] above all things can you say that above
[48:53] all things i would that you prosper in
[48:56] health
[48:58] hallelujah above all things he said my
[49:02] i want you to prosper in health he said
[49:04] but what happens
[49:05] satan tries to get by that by poking in
[49:08] a little doubt or
[49:09] leave something into your conscience or
[49:11] something into your memory or something
[49:13] into other
[49:14] some other avenue and he tries to find
[49:16] an outlet or a weakness he can get you
[49:18] in
[49:19] he begins to use all those little
[49:20] different channels if he can get your
[49:22] mind to accept it
[49:26] oh but what he can batter against you
[49:30] but it can't get to you unless
[49:33] you accept it
[49:38] what the doctor said can battle against
[49:40] you
[49:42] what your mind is saying can battle
[49:44] against you
[49:46] but until you accept it it can't get to
[49:48] you
[49:50] hallelujah when satan walked up to eve
[49:53] you know the fruit is pleasant
[49:54] what happened she stopped for just a
[49:56] moment and she began to reason it all
[49:58] out and she stopped he said don't stop
[50:00] for nothing
[50:03] listen we're too far along the journey
[50:05] this ain't the time to stop
[50:07] he said don't stop for nothing you got
[50:09] the message
[50:11] who's got the message tonight jesus
[50:13] lives god's a healer
[50:15] he's a deliverer he's a savior he's the
[50:18] same yesterday today and forever
[50:20] don't stop for nothing hallelujah
[50:23] i've heard the message and i'm going to
[50:25] believe it no matter what
[50:27] [Music]
[50:31] but she stopped for a moment and when
[50:35] she did that's when satan walked into
[50:37] the mind
[50:39] well that sounds reasonable yeah he did
[50:42] say that but i understand what you're
[50:44] saying
[50:46] what about what had happened to abraham
[50:48] if he would have stopped yeah
[50:49] right he'd have never received the
[50:51] promised son
[50:53] or you could manufacture something but
[50:54] that wasn't what god was talking about
[50:56] he'd have never received the promised
[50:58] son
[50:59] and people have manufactured things and
[51:01] manufactured but there's going to be a
[51:03] people that receive a promised son
[51:06] hallelujah amen what if he had stopped
[51:08] for reason and when he said
[51:10] sarah was going to have a baby here here
[51:12] she is now 65 of him 75 and
[51:15] he gets to be a hunter and she gets to
[51:16] be at 90 90 years old
[51:19] no hope left
[51:23] and you say well i hope you i get this
[51:25] right i hope i'll be well
[51:27] i hope i'll get the holy ghost i hope
[51:29] i'm a christian
[51:30] i hope i do you don't want that against
[51:33] hope
[51:34] he believed in the word of god faith is
[51:37] beyond hope
[51:38] [Music]
[51:39] faith comes from back inside faith comes
[51:43] from in here
[51:44] amen but through this mind this battle
[51:46] is going on
[51:47] he said when you get the battle setting
[51:49] array the devil is sitting right here on
[51:51] every heart he said right here in this
[51:55] meeting
[51:55] every heart he's trying to sit there and
[51:58] he's trying to bring down
[52:00] he's trying to bring fear he's trying to
[52:02] bring unbelief
[52:03] he's trying to tell you it'll be another
[52:05] service he's trying to say it'll be
[52:07] another time
[52:08] he's trying to tell you we can't have
[52:10] another service like we've had before
[52:12] he's trying to tell you all kinds of
[52:13] things he's trying to
[52:15] he said well what do you have to do when
[52:17] he comes cast
[52:18] him out that's all cast him out
[52:22] amen that's right cast him out
[52:25] we have been trained
[52:30] oh hallelujah i believe there's a people
[52:32] here today that's been trained
[52:34] to cast out devils
[52:38] amen and i i understand those demonics
[52:41] that forces that expose themselves
[52:43] and show themselves by speaking out of
[52:45] somebody but i'm talking about even the
[52:47] devil that wants to come and try to turn
[52:48] your mind or
[52:49] interrupt your mind cast him out say no
[52:53] satan i got
[52:54] god's word it's first place and i'm
[52:56] listening for the sound
[52:58] i'm listening for it and i know at any
[53:00] moment the angels of god are going to
[53:02] begin to move
[53:03] and things are going to be to take place
[53:05] and i'm waiting for that sound
[53:08] amen is what he told david he said you
[53:10] wait for the sound
[53:11] of a going you wait for the rustling and
[53:14] the mulberry trees
[53:15] and you wait on there and you don't move
[53:18] until it happens
[53:20] cast down your reasoning david cast down
[53:22] at the heart of the army's bigger and
[53:24] greater
[53:24] because when i move i move
[53:28] oh hallelujah when god moves god moves
[53:32] and when he begins to move it's time to
[53:34] step into the water
[53:36] [Applause]
[53:40] got to thinking about that after
[53:42] wednesday night
[53:44] unless wednesday night some came up
[53:46] within about 30 minutes of the preaching
[53:49] apparently didn't bother god might have
[53:52] been out of somebody's order somewhere
[53:53] but it wasn't out of god's order
[53:56] amen but i got to think of the member of
[54:00] the air and i believe was talking about
[54:01] it afterwards
[54:02] you know when that angel came down into
[54:04] the pool and began to trouble the water
[54:06] i don't see anywhere that there was a
[54:08] guaranteed time he was going to be
[54:10] there anybody read it
[54:14] 30 minutes 30 seconds hour
[54:17] three hours one day no he said when he
[54:19] troubles you get in
[54:25] when god's moving you get in
[54:28] be sensitive to the spirit of god we
[54:30] ought to be a people that's sensitive
[54:33] when god's moving amen we realize he
[54:36] said we ought to be a trained he said
[54:38] you said what's the matter with us
[54:39] preachers he said i wonder what kind of
[54:41] training we have had
[54:43] he says there in daniel 12 there'll be a
[54:45] time of trouble such as never like on
[54:46] the earth before

[55:08] just a kid going and jumping the train
[55:11] and going down to baton rouge for the
[55:12] day

[1:40:57] think world war one when communication
[1:41:00] wasn't the same
[1:41:02] and they had an old pigeon
[1:41:04] [Music]
[1:41:06] a carrier dove
[1:41:08] [Music]
[1:41:09] to carry the message

[1:41:38] and as it began to rise i guess the the
[1:41:41] opposing enemies seeing it there
[1:41:43] began to shoot at it and graze this wing
[1:41:46] and graze his back and
[1:41:48] grave maybe shot off one one leg but he
[1:41:51] still had the message
[1:41:56] and just in the nick of time here he
[1:41:59] he he makes it up high enough till he's
[1:42:02] out of reach
[1:42:04] and he flies over into the camp and he
[1:42:06] makes it in
[1:42:08] the message got through on the wings of
[1:42:11] a dove
[1:42:12] amen the message got in amen i remember
[1:42:16] of another great dove

[1:42:22] was bruised for
[1:42:23] my iniquity and the chastisement of my
[1:42:27] peace
