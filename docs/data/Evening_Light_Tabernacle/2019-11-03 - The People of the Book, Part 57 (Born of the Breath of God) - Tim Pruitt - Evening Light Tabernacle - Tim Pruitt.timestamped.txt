[48:04] many saints that have gone home to be

[48:08] sister Benton's which is brother Jackie
[48:12] Benton's wife passed away and they
[48:17] planted her as a seed into the ground
[48:20] waiting for a resurrection and there's
[48:24] been many many others that I could name
[48:27] that and some that I don't know very
[48:30] well but just hearing their names called
[48:33] and and whatever the different prayer
[48:36] requests that have come in for us to
[48:38] pray for those that are struggling with
[48:40] needs several deaths up in Tennessee and
[48:43] several deaths up in the UM Cloverdale
[48:46] area several deaths in Virginia and so
[48:50] on different ones that we've heard about
[48:52] this week and also one of our minister
[48:56] brothers from Belgium brother
[49:00] Guiteau van Bronk has just passed away
[49:05] you know his going home didn't make me
[49:09] feel real well he was only two years
[49:11] older than me
[49:12] so you know as he he left he just just
[49:20] kind of had his last notes you know that
[49:23] he
[49:23] on his desk and it was wrote a new body
[49:27] and so you know that's what he was
[49:29] looking forward to was a new body and
[49:32] just once wasn't so much sick he just
[49:36] come off of some mission trips and
[49:38] shared with us about that
[49:40] Saten it was like he sat down on the
[49:43] stairwell laid his head down on his
[49:45] shoulder and went home a man so but back
[49:49] in August brother Ron Spencer had a
[49:52] meeting there in the North Carolina
[49:54] meetings and they were not intending a
[49:59] prayer line that night they just had
[50:00] mass prayer for everybody because there
[50:03] are many many needs and and so he
[50:07] stepped behind the curtain of the stage
[50:09] there in the auditorium were they were
[50:12] having the meetings and someone came
[50:14] from prayer and then another came for
[50:15] prayer and another coming from prayer
[50:17] brother Guido come running up and the
[50:20] Lord just spoken and and told him
[50:22] trouble lays just ahead the train is
[50:26] coming for you but it'll be okay to go
[50:28] and now less than six weeks later two
[50:31] months later he's gone to be with the
[50:33] Lord God knows exactly our our date of
[50:38] birth and the time that he wants to take
[50:40] us home amen but there's no such thing
[50:43] as death for a Christian you just
[50:45] changed dwelling places amen so you know
[50:49] we want to thank the Lord for those
[50:51] words of comfort as as it was spoken
[50:55] trouble lays just ahead the Train is
[50:58] coming for you
[50:59] it'll be okay to go and that's why we
[51:01] want it when it comes our time to go we
[51:03] want to know it's okay to go any man but
[51:06] we're looking for the coming of the Lord
[51:08] the rapture of the church we want to
[51:11] thank God that there are gifts that lay
[51:13] in the body gifts of healing give some
[51:16] miracles gifts of discerning of spirits
[51:20] gifts of words of knowledge that are
[51:23] given to us now none of these take
[51:25] brother branham's place or our even
[51:29] duplicate the Ministry of Jesus Christ
[51:32] that was displayed through that
[51:35] particular
[51:36] ministry that did what Jesus did none of
[51:39] these are intended to impersonate or to
[51:42] take their place they are just gifts
[51:44] that lays in the body a man that we
[51:47] believe that and you know it's just like
[51:51] the gift of faith are some people have
[51:54] great faith just and claim the promises
[51:57] of God and and gifts of healing give
[52:00] some miracles all of these things lay in
[52:03] the body of Christ they all come because
[52:06] of what Jesus did for us at Calvary and
[52:08] were born into that body I just just
[52:12] wanted to share with you a little
[52:14] testimony they come in you know the the
[52:16] other Sunday we prayed for a little
[52:19] sister who her husband had a typhoid
[52:23] type fever that the doctor said and
[52:27] their little two-year-old about two year
[52:30] old son was also come down with the
[52:33] fever and and you know we had sent a
[52:36] prayer cloth here some time ago and and
[52:39] to her because she has cancer and and so
[52:45] she'd been taking chemotherapy and and
[52:47] so on and and she you know asked for
[52:52] prayer so we sent her prayer cloths and
[52:54] I just told her to take that prayer
[52:56] cloth and go lay it on her husband and
[52:58] her child and while the husband went to
[53:00] work the next morning and the child it
[53:02] was healed and running around and
[53:04] without a fever and
[53:08] I told God is still God and the answers
[53:13] prayer no matter what it is but she just
[53:16] shared with me and I just want to share
[53:17] a part of this that when the she said
[53:20] when the prayer cloth reached me I just
[53:22] finished my fifth chemo and came home I
[53:26] held on to it and prayed and claimed my
[53:27] healing what I didn't tell you was
[53:29] usually after my chemo I cannot eat or
[53:32] drink I'd be tired and in pain it takes
[53:35] almost two to three weeks to feel well
[53:37] and mouth ulcers to go away and the last
[53:40] three to four days I can eat a little
[53:42] better but this time it was different
[53:44] I ate normal food from days 7 itself
[53:47] I wasn't feeling fatigue and no mouth
[53:50] ulcers in fact I was even in the the
[53:53] cooking in the kitchen running around
[53:55] after my son and even my blood work was
[53:59] normal unlike before and the doctor said
[54:04] if it goes down I might need a
[54:05] transfusion but it never went down it
[54:07] only went up and after my six chemo I
[54:10] was able to eat normal food and within
[54:11] four days I forgot I'd went through
[54:13] chemo I was surprised myself I was
[54:16] eating normal being normal active I'm
[54:20] sorry I didn't tell you but I I didn't
[54:22] have time to sit and write with much my
[54:24] son running around and I was so caught
[54:27] up enjoying and sharing the Fall Meeting
[54:29] messages it's a blessing with my family
[54:31] and friends and I shared that link to
[54:33] all my contacts so they could have a
[54:35] revival to amen but I'm healed sir and
[54:38] no in fact I'm demanded my husband we
[54:41] should stop the radiation because it
[54:43] ain't required anymore our radiation is
[54:45] from the Lord
[54:53] amen
[54:55] these folks regularly listen in from
[54:58] India and and so we're just want to
[55:02] greet you today in the name of the Lord
[55:04] and the bright around the world wherever
[55:06] you're assembled and our being with us
[55:08] it was something just more that I I
[55:12] wanted to share about that if I could
[55:15] because I didn't read you this whole
[55:17] thing but she just one doesn't you see
[55:21] said God bless your congregation - said
[55:24] I really love them the love they have
[55:25] the atmosphere that they create takes us
[55:28] more into his presence so it's really
[55:32] really important about the atmosphere
[55:34] you create remember when you come
[55:37] together we're not playing Church we are
[55:40] here to come in the presence of God and
[55:42] worship Him with all of our hearts and
[55:44] just let the Holy Spirit move in our
[55:48] lives and you know you don't ever want
[55:50] to be destructive or or whatever you
[55:52] know just sit patiently and stay in tune
[55:55] and do your part to pull on the gift of
[55:58] God because it's affecting somebody
[56:00] around the world that may mean the
[56:02] difference for their healing or their
[56:04] deliverance so I wanted just to bring
[56:07] that to your memory to your attention
[56:09] today Matthew chapter 13 verse 24 we
[56:13] want to read from as we look into the
[56:16] Word of God today Matthew 13 and verse
[56:20] 24 will you just read this together with
[56:24] me if you'll open your Bibles there and
[56:28] another parable put he forth unto them
[56:30] saying the kingdom of heaven is likened
[56:33] unto a man which sowed good seed in his
[56:37] field but while men slept his enemy came
[56:41] and sowed tares among the wheat and went
[56:43] his way but when the blade was sprung up
[56:48] and brought forth fruit there appeared
[56:50] also the tares also and so the servants
[56:54] of the householder came in 7 to him sir
[56:57] did it sound not so good seed in thy
[56:59] field from whence then hath it
[57:01] terrors and he said unto them and the
[57:04] enemy has done this and the servant said
[57:08] unto Him wilt thou then that we go and
[57:11] gather them up but he said nay less Wow
[57:14] you gather up the tares ye root up also
[57:17] the weed and with them let both grow
[57:20] together until the harvest and in the
[57:24] time of harvest I will say to the
[57:26] Reapers gather ye together first to
[57:29] tears him bind them in bundles to burn
[57:32] them but gather the wheat into my barn
[57:34] and the answered and said unto them this
[57:38] is verse 37 now he answered and said
[57:41] unto them he that sowed the good seed is
[57:44] the son of man the field is the world
[57:47] the good seed are the children of the
[57:49] kingdom but the tares are the children
[57:52] of the wicked one the enemy that sowed
[57:54] them is the devil the harvest is the end
[57:57] of the world and the Reapers are the
[57:58] Angels as therefore the tares are
[58:01] gathered and burned in the fire so shall
[58:04] it be in the end of this world the Son
[58:07] of man shall send forth his angels and
[58:09] they shall gather out of his kingdom all
[58:12] things that offend and them which do
[58:14] iniquity and shall cast them into a
[58:17] furnace of fire and there shall be
[58:19] wailing and gnashing of teeth and then
[58:22] shall go how the righteous shine forth
[58:25] as the Sun in the kingdom of their
[58:28] father who have ears to hear let him
[58:31] hear a man always wonderful words of
[58:35] life reminding you of what we read in
[58:39] Matthew where'er that he spoke John the
[58:43] Baptist was the forerunner of the coming
[58:45] of Jesus and he came as the Alliance
[58:48] Elisha prophet to prepare the hearts of
[58:53] the fathers for the children to come on
[58:56] the scene the children meaning Jesus and
[58:59] His disciples and he told them said that
[59:01] he that cometh after me shall baptize
[59:04] you with the Holy Ghost and with fire
[59:07] verse 12 of Matthew 3 says whose
[59:10] families in his hand
[59:11] and he will thoroughly purge his floor
[59:13] and gather his wheat into the garner and
[59:18] the Corsa Garner is a granary or
[59:20] storehouse or barn and but he will burn
[59:24] up the chaff with unquenchable fire
[59:28] so now as we're looking upon this today
[59:32] we're we're going to we're going to set
[59:36] some foundational work as I go into this
[59:40] subject today because I'm gonna be
[59:42] speaking on being born of the breath of
[59:45] God and so wouldn't but as we look here
[59:51] in the scripture we see that Jesus would
[59:54] also speak of the kingdom and he defined
[59:57] the kingdom of God in stages of the
[1:00:01] wheat plant for an example the seed the
[1:00:05] blade the ear and after there the full
[1:00:07] corn in the in the ear now the reason
[1:00:10] why that Jesus would use these parables
[1:00:13] was when the Jews rejected Christ and
[1:00:16] thus would prevent him from reigning as
[1:00:18] son of David in the Millennial Kingdom
[1:00:21] the kingdom that took on a different
[1:00:23] form it became a mystery form and and so
[1:00:27] Jesus would actually tell us of the
[1:00:30] kingdom of God that he was introducing
[1:00:32] was a spiritual Kingdom that would be in
[1:00:36] place until the Millennial Kingdom could
[1:00:38] come in where he could reign physically
[1:00:40] as the son of David with his bride with
[1:00:43] his church now so Jesus let us know that
[1:00:47] the kingdom as a wheat plant would go
[1:00:50] from grain the grain planted to the
[1:00:54] grain harvesting in other words um that
[1:00:58] what was planted would be manifested in
[1:01:01] the harvest time but in between those
[1:01:04] time the kingdom would look like nothing
[1:01:06] like the original grain like the blade
[1:01:10] the stalk and the husk looks nothing
[1:01:13] like the original grain that was planted
[1:01:18] of course
[1:01:19] we identify as well that's a that's a
[1:01:22] wheat plant but it
[1:01:23] look anything like the grain it's it's
[1:01:26] green it's a blade it's not a it's not a
[1:01:29] hard seed with life in it but it is life
[1:01:33] in it but it's now in a different form
[1:01:36] as it goes through its stages and so the
[1:01:39] kingdom in between the two seeds would
[1:01:42] look nothing like the original grain
[1:01:44] until it come back to a mature corn in
[1:01:49] the ear again now Jesus would tell us in
[1:01:52] mark chapter six and I mean mark chapter
[1:01:55] four verse 26 he would also tell us how
[1:01:59] the kingdom of God would be and he said
[1:02:01] so is the kingdom of God as if a man
[1:02:04] cast seed into the ground and he should
[1:02:08] sleep and rise night and day and the
[1:02:11] seed spring and grow up he know it not
[1:02:14] how for the earth bringeth forth fruit
[1:02:18] of herself first the blade then the ear
[1:02:21] and after that the full corn in the ear
[1:02:24] but when the fruit is broke forth
[1:02:27] immediately he put it put it in the
[1:02:30] sickle because harvest has come so Jesus
[1:02:35] again would tell us and describe how
[1:02:38] that the kingdom would actually go from
[1:02:41] grain to grain but in between those
[1:02:44] times it would be different other stages
[1:02:47] and these stages they would possess
[1:02:51] different qualities of the life that was
[1:02:54] in the grain but the resemblance and the
[1:02:57] look would not be the same that there
[1:02:59] would be it would be the same church but
[1:03:02] it would be in a different form but it
[1:03:04] wouldn't be a mature form it would be an
[1:03:06] immature form and it wouldn't be a
[1:03:09] harvestable form it would be a form that
[1:03:12] wasn't ready for the garner or the
[1:03:14] rapture it would be a something that was
[1:03:19] in stages waiting until the grain come
[1:03:23] back again and the the wheat would put
[1:03:26] on the full corn and within the ear now
[1:03:30] according to the Bible there are three
[1:03:34] groups that represents the church
[1:03:37] we know there's only really one church
[1:03:39] but yet at the same time there are many
[1:03:42] groups that represent the church all
[1:03:44] right so there are these there are two
[1:03:48] that are described in the book of
[1:03:50] Matthew chapter 25 word that he speaks a
[1:03:54] bill of wise and a foolish virgin now
[1:03:58] both of these are under the umbrella of
[1:04:01] the word Church you know and but the the
[1:04:05] wives will go into the marriage because
[1:04:07] they have oil in their vessels with
[1:04:09] their lamps
[1:04:10] now the foolish are there also virgins
[1:04:14] there are pure people they they're also
[1:04:17] a part of of the group but yet the
[1:04:20] foolish have lamps and that which is a
[1:04:24] profession but they have no L they they
[1:04:28] have a confession and confess that Jesus
[1:04:31] is Lord but never go on to receive the
[1:04:35] Holy Ghost are you with me
[1:04:37] they and as a result because they have
[1:04:40] no oil in their vessels with their lamps
[1:04:43] they are cast into outer darkness where
[1:04:47] there is weeping and wailing and
[1:04:48] gnashing of teeth now this is the Great
[1:04:50] Tribulation now this group receives life
[1:04:54] at the white throne judgment they're not
[1:04:57] lost now let's get an understanding you
[1:05:00] know God is a God full of grace and he's
[1:05:03] got a lot more grace you know what you
[1:05:05] and I can imagine we think a lot of
[1:05:08] times only if God God only deals with
[1:05:11] with my little group or this little
[1:05:13] group or whatever but God is such a big
[1:05:17] God a mountain and he's a god that is
[1:05:19] such full of grace he's got his children
[1:05:22] he's got a bride that's an elected is
[1:05:25] his church that's going in a rapture but
[1:05:27] according to the Bible there's also
[1:05:29] another elect people who will go through
[1:05:33] the tribulation and they will need
[1:05:36] further purging and will be given life
[1:05:38] at the white throne judgment now we're
[1:05:40] gonna look into some of these things as
[1:05:42] we look in the scripture along but
[1:05:45] before we do I want to talk about
[1:05:47] another group that is also called the
[1:05:49] church
[1:05:50] and this church is not a virgin
[1:05:54] you know with the other two our virgin
[1:05:57] they're pure people they have works of
[1:05:59] purity in their lives and but the other
[1:06:05] one is not a virgin she's called the
[1:06:07] great now she is found in
[1:06:10] revelation 17 and 18 she also is a
[1:06:14] church and unfortunately she will be
[1:06:18] burned with fire so now already we're
[1:06:22] seeing something because this group is
[1:06:25] lost eternally but he will burn them up
[1:06:30] like the Bible said he will burn up the
[1:06:33] chaff with unquenchable fire so now the
[1:06:39] Bible the Bible now tells that when the
[1:06:41] great babblin comes up in remembrance
[1:06:44] before God that he will stone that
[1:06:47] prostitute with hell stones weigh in a
[1:06:50] hundred pounds apiece if you look in
[1:06:53] Revelation 18 and verse 8 it tells about
[1:06:56] her plagues shall come in one day death
[1:06:59] and mourning and famine and she shall be
[1:07:02] utterly burned with fire for strong is
[1:07:05] the Lord who gestured so we can see her
[1:07:09] plagues will come but it also tells us
[1:07:11] and I didn't write the scripture down
[1:07:13] but it's also in Revelation that he will
[1:07:15] he will stone her with hailstones weigh
[1:07:18] in a hundred pounds apiece I'll tell you
[1:07:22] what God that's the fury of Almighty God
[1:07:25] that'll be poured out on the Hori system
[1:07:28] but all of these are churches so now we
[1:07:31] got a bride that's going in the rapture
[1:07:33] she is the church we got a church that
[1:07:36] is going to the Tribulation Period that
[1:07:38] lays ahead after that the rapture is
[1:07:40] over and that will they will be and that
[1:07:43] will be hunted down by the beast and the
[1:07:45] false prophet and a great terrible
[1:07:47] persecution that we already see things
[1:07:49] coming in order right now in our very
[1:07:53] nation as our nation turns from from
[1:07:57] being a nation under God to nation who
[1:08:00] doesn't want God
[1:08:02] and so you can see the very attitude and
[1:08:04] the spirits of people that are being
[1:08:06] changed even in Revelation 13 as it
[1:08:09] shows the Beast that rises up out of the
[1:08:13] land which is America it changes from
[1:08:16] like a lamb to speak as the dragon so it
[1:08:21] leaves as part of freedom of religion
[1:08:24] and begins to speak as a dragon did
[1:08:27] before them which which again we're
[1:08:29] we're living in a day where we're fastly
[1:08:32] losing our Liberty now but however
[1:08:36] before that time comes the Bride of
[1:08:39] Christ is leaving here now that's what
[1:08:41] our job is to do is to try to prepare
[1:08:44] you for the leaving not the stay now
[1:08:48] there are those that are prophesying
[1:08:49] people right into the tribulation but
[1:08:52] what we want to do is prophesy you right
[1:08:54] into a rapture any man because I believe
[1:08:58] that there is a rapture for the church
[1:09:00] but then there's another group who has
[1:09:02] also calls themselves a church and she's
[1:09:05] a woman also but she's not a virgin
[1:09:07] she's a because she's taken in the
[1:09:10] seeds of man theology and ideas of man
[1:09:13] over the Word of God and God calls her a
[1:09:18] and he will burn her with fire I
[1:09:21] just read it in the scripture he will
[1:09:23] also heal will also stone her with
[1:09:26] stones just like they did in the Old
[1:09:29] Testament where that knew were men and
[1:09:32] women caught in adultery with stone with
[1:09:34] stones and burn with fire God will do
[1:09:36] the same thing to the prostitute system
[1:09:39] so again it's important that we we be in
[1:09:43] the right group where we can win we're
[1:09:46] part of the church we don't want to be
[1:09:48] in the church that receives the plagues
[1:09:50] in the book of Revelation we don't
[1:09:53] either want to be in the church that
[1:09:55] goes through the tribulation we want to
[1:09:57] be in the bride that goes in a rapture
[1:09:59] how many wants to be a part of that
[1:10:01] bride a ma'am just cake the thing is
[1:10:04] under coming up on the earth now brother
[1:10:07] Branham would tell would tell us in the
[1:10:09] message that token he said it's a type
[1:10:11] of today shown that we
[1:10:13] face in another exodus God bring an
[1:10:16] Israel out of Egypt to the promised land
[1:10:18] was a type of Christ
[1:10:20] bringing the bride out of the church to
[1:10:22] the promised land we're in another
[1:10:24] exodus now if you study the scripture
[1:10:27] you know where it's God brought a nation
[1:10:30] out of a nation God will bring the bride
[1:10:32] out of a church the bride will be called
[1:10:35] from all the churches it'll be the
[1:10:37] election of God will be brought out and
[1:10:40] we're on the verge of that exodus right
[1:10:42] now but we have every scriptural proof
[1:10:45] that we're standing there and he said I
[1:10:47] know it's been said a lot of times but
[1:10:50] my friends one time it'll be said for
[1:10:51] the last time time will fade into
[1:10:54] eternity then he's coming to take a
[1:10:56] bride out of the church and the token
[1:11:00] was the thing that the token in the in
[1:11:02] Israel was the blood of the Lamb a man
[1:11:06] our token is the Holy Ghost it's the
[1:11:08] sign that we must have so the death
[1:11:11] angel will pass over us so the token was
[1:11:14] the thing that made the difference
[1:11:15] between Egypt and Israel the two nations
[1:11:18] they were all human beings all God
[1:11:21] created all the handiwork of God but the
[1:11:24] difference when the death penalty was
[1:11:26] passed the difference between life and
[1:11:28] death
[1:11:29] was to token so will it be at the coming
[1:11:32] of the Son of God when he brings the
[1:11:34] bride out of the church the difference
[1:11:37] will be the token now listen close and
[1:11:41] see the truth the token will be the
[1:11:44] difference yes God would be a difference
[1:11:46] so notice these things as brother
[1:11:48] Branham was bringing it to us there is a
[1:11:50] difference between the church that goes
[1:11:53] in a rapture and the church that goes
[1:11:56] through the tribulation and the church
[1:11:58] that gets burnt with fire are you with
[1:12:01] me remember now is part of the wheat
[1:12:04] plant that gets burned with unquenchable
[1:12:06] fire so you is shown in the scripture
[1:12:09] some has burned some is harvested and
[1:12:12] summons for other uses right amens
[1:12:16] because there there's a use for other
[1:12:18] parts of the plantiffs the straw is
[1:12:21] bailed for other uses
[1:12:23] but the grain goes in the barn he goes
[1:12:26] into garner but but the but part of it
[1:12:30] gets burned with unquenchable fire
[1:12:32] so you know you want to identify and see
[1:12:36] what part and realize what makes the
[1:12:40] difference what is going to make the
[1:12:42] difference between the real church that
[1:12:45] goes in a rapture and the church that
[1:12:47] goes through the tribulation or the
[1:12:49] others against mark with fire the
[1:12:51] difference is going to be the token
[1:12:53] which is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:57] now so you see as we're looking at this
[1:13:01] there's coming up your vacation upon the
[1:13:04] earth the Bible says so that the earth
[1:13:06] will burn with the fervent Heat Malikov
[1:13:10] or cells that will walk out on the ashes
[1:13:13] of the wicked because that the earth
[1:13:16] will burn and yea the wicked and all
[1:13:18] that do wickedly shall burn with it with
[1:13:21] them all will be ashes under the soles
[1:13:23] of our feet this is the Bible right so
[1:13:27] you know so they're the first as we look
[1:13:31] at there is a church and that church we
[1:13:34] call the bride because he said I will
[1:13:37] have a church without spot or wrinkle
[1:13:39] and yet that church is also in a
[1:13:43] marriage relationship with Christ and
[1:13:45] that marriage relationship well and Paul
[1:13:49] would use that in in Ephesians 532 and
[1:13:52] he would tell us this is a great mystery
[1:13:55] but I speak concerning Christ in the
[1:13:57] church and he would define the man and
[1:13:59] the woman and the marriage between the
[1:14:02] man and the woman to show that the
[1:14:04] mystery of what Christ was doing that he
[1:14:07] had come for the purpose of getting a
[1:14:09] bride and Manny he come me come to get a
[1:14:13] people who would be bone of his bone
[1:14:15] flesh of his flesh life of his life
[1:14:18] power of his power all that he is she is
[1:14:21] are you with me so again he would
[1:14:24] identify that look at verse 23 as he as
[1:14:28] he defines it Christ is a head of the
[1:14:31] church he's the savior of the body
[1:14:34] he would see Christ
[1:14:36] love the church gave himself thought
[1:14:38] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:14:40] with the washing of the water by the
[1:14:42] word verse 27 that he might present it
[1:14:45] to himself a glorious church not having
[1:14:48] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it
[1:14:52] should be wholly without blemish in
[1:14:54] verse 30 he would say we are members of
[1:14:57] his body of his flesh and of his bones
[1:14:59] and he says they too shall be one flesh
[1:15:03] so now he is very clear that there is
[1:15:07] going to be a people that that match him
[1:15:10] then a bone of his bone and life of his
[1:15:14] life and power of his power and they
[1:15:17] have his life that's what the token is
[1:15:19] they have his life the Holy Ghost in
[1:15:23] their life there they're not just
[1:15:25] professed believers but they are filled
[1:15:29] with a very life of Jesus Christ they
[1:15:33] are of his species they are miss Janice
[1:15:36] they came from him they are going back
[1:15:39] to him a man that she is this bride is a
[1:15:43] perfect match
[1:15:44] peace to him a man she can yield to him
[1:15:49] because he is the head and and she can
[1:15:51] surrender her life unto Him because I'll
[1:15:54] surrender her all because he's her
[1:15:57] husband
[1:15:58] and so all of these come into play in
[1:16:01] this relationship between the bride and
[1:16:04] cries now look with me in Revelation 19
[1:16:07] and 7 let's just get another a word for
[1:16:10] this bride another scripture about is
[1:16:13] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:16:15] honour to him for the marriage of the
[1:16:18] lamb is come and his wife has made
[1:16:21] herself ready so I want you say
[1:16:23] something here what we're here because
[1:16:26] the marriage of the lamb has come what
[1:16:29] species must marry species kind after
[1:16:33] kind is that Bible amen so every seed
[1:16:38] must bring forth of his kind all the way
[1:16:41] back from Genesis so now if the lamb is
[1:16:44] going to get married he's gonna have to
[1:16:47] have a lamb owner
[1:16:48] that matches the lamb coming from heaven
[1:16:50] so even as he was a lamb submissive to
[1:16:54] the father's word even so the bride
[1:16:57] would be a lamb submissive to the word
[1:17:00] hey man now so and to her was was
[1:17:05] granted that she should be arrayed in
[1:17:08] fine linen clean and white for the fine
[1:17:11] linen is the righteousness of the saints
[1:17:14] and he said unto me write blessed are
[1:17:17] they which are called to the marriage
[1:17:19] supper of the lamb and he said unto me
[1:17:21] these are the true sayings of God now
[1:17:25] mark that place because we'll refer back
[1:17:27] to it in a little bit but now so you
[1:17:30] notice there's a bride and there's going
[1:17:31] to be a marriage of the lamb there is a
[1:17:34] people that is being married to the
[1:17:37] groom let me just stop just for a moment
[1:17:41] you remember everything God did through
[1:17:43] the scriptures was really a reflection
[1:17:45] of the very longing of the heart of God
[1:17:48] so when God dwelled alone and by himself
[1:17:53] the longley God not before he was even
[1:17:55] called God God is an object of worship
[1:17:58] and there was nobody to worship him see
[1:18:00] not God at this point he hasn't he has
[1:18:02] the abilities to become God but he has
[1:18:04] to first make objects to worship Him
[1:18:07] a man so he would make angels and angels
[1:18:09] would worship Him but now he's God when
[1:18:12] angels worship him but now but now but
[1:18:16] he's Elohim the self-existent one he
[1:18:19] exists alone and by himself and he has
[1:18:21] desires within him he has thoughts
[1:18:23] within him and these thoughts have never
[1:18:26] been released and then when he releases
[1:18:29] these thoughts they're in the form of
[1:18:31] the word or the logos and by the word
[1:18:33] he'll create everything so this is why
[1:18:36] he has thought of his father and the son
[1:18:38] because he as a father he out from him
[1:18:42] comes the logos through which he will
[1:18:45] create the whole world a man he'll bring
[1:18:48] all things into existence are you with
[1:18:51] me now so this is why this when it when
[1:18:54] it comes back to the beginning the
[1:18:56] Christ sent in the begin
[1:18:57] was the word the logos and the Word was
[1:19:00] with God and the Word was God and this
[1:19:04] word was in the beginning with God and
[1:19:07] by the word he created all things that
[1:19:10] was made right so therefore when God
[1:19:14] would say let us make man he is he is
[1:19:16] speaking of what he is doing not as in
[1:19:20] it as the Eternal Spirit along but
[1:19:23] working through the very vehicle of the
[1:19:27] logos by the word he begins to beget he
[1:19:31] begins to create by the word but now
[1:19:34] there's something in the heart of God
[1:19:36] God is very lonely
[1:19:37] he is dwelt for eons while there was no
[1:19:41] time so of eternity which we can't
[1:19:44] comprehend before time ever even exists
[1:19:48] as it begins and you can't even mention
[1:19:50] in years because there immeasurables
[1:19:52] called God always was and so there in
[1:19:55] the eternal as he there dwells alone and
[1:19:58] by himself he has these desires I want I
[1:20:02] want someone I can share my life with I
[1:20:05] want someone that you know that will
[1:20:09] will be someone that I can that well
[1:20:13] it'll just be me and another farm
[1:20:16] I want fellowship I desire to hell I'm
[1:20:21] lonely and I won't fellowship you know
[1:20:23] what God made man in His image how did
[1:20:26] he make him he made the man he made the
[1:20:29] man but he didn't make a woman right but
[1:20:32] the woman was there but she was just in
[1:20:34] him that's the way it was with you I
[1:20:37] mean you always were because when we see
[1:20:41] this lonely God it wasn't that you
[1:20:43] didn't exist you were just in him before
[1:20:46] the world ever began all brother that's
[1:20:49] why I'm trying to tell you you're not a
[1:20:50] temporal being your are eternal being
[1:20:53] your coming from God you're going back
[1:20:55] to God
[1:20:56] you always were you didn't just begin at
[1:20:59] the altar
[1:21:01] hallelujah you didn't just become a son
[1:21:04] at the altar
[1:21:05] you always were a son you always were a
[1:21:08] daughter of God no matter how lost you
[1:21:10] were no matter how far you were out in
[1:21:12] the sin you were always his son you were
[1:21:15] always his daughter he came to seek and
[1:21:19] to save that which was lost everything
[1:21:27] God has ever done is a count on the
[1:21:29] count of you the reason he made a world
[1:21:33] is because of you the reason he made
[1:21:35] angels is on account of you the reason
[1:21:38] there is a heaven is because of you your
[1:21:47] the central theme of God's heart so
[1:21:51] don't let the devil to tell you you some
[1:21:53] kind of down trust something that God
[1:21:55] don't care about your the very thoughts
[1:21:58] of his heart so when he makes man he
[1:22:02] makes him in His image so being in the
[1:22:05] image of God you don't see a woman
[1:22:07] because to be in the image of God the
[1:22:09] woman was in the was in Christ in God
[1:22:12] right amen so here where was he she was
[1:22:15] there all the times he was just hidden
[1:22:17] in the man she was that hidden secret
[1:22:19] until God put him to sleep and then when
[1:22:24] he put him to sleep there who Adam to
[1:22:26] sleep he pulled out a part of him and
[1:22:28] now because why he said it's not good
[1:22:31] that man should be alone
[1:22:33] a man God knew that he knew what it
[1:22:37] meant to be alone he went he wanted to
[1:22:40] counterpart so this is why he began all
[1:22:43] of creation this is why the logos was
[1:22:45] released from him to begin with a man so
[1:22:49] that he would have more sons of God more
[1:22:51] daughters of God more logos just like
[1:22:54] him they're going to be the word the
[1:22:56] word bride the word people are you with
[1:22:59] me now so now again there he would put
[1:23:03] Adam to sleep and he would pull out the
[1:23:06] elements that was necessary to farm Eve
[1:23:09] and I can imagine as God formed her
[1:23:13] imagine as his fingers formed her
[1:23:16] carefully her face and he pulled there
[1:23:19] and began to develop and begin to to
[1:23:22] look into that no doubt his eyes were
[1:23:27] looking way beyond this little piece of
[1:23:31] clay he's working on right here
[1:23:32] with a rib from Adam and he's thinking
[1:23:36] one day I'm gonna go to sleep one day
[1:23:41] I'm gonna be hunting across one day in
[1:23:44] my sleep
[1:23:45] there's gonna be something coming forth
[1:23:47] from me and there's gonna be elements of
[1:23:52] water blood and spirit a man that will
[1:23:56] come from me from my body and it'll be
[1:23:59] the elements I'll form a bride out and
[1:24:03] once I get that bride I'll never be
[1:24:05] lonely again because it's a different
[1:24:08] listen it's a different form of
[1:24:11] fellowship if I could explain it to you
[1:24:15] and oh god help me to to do this but you
[1:24:18] know did you know you you are greater
[1:24:21] than angels you only made a little lower
[1:24:25] than the Angels for a time for the
[1:24:28] purpose of temptation and sin and
[1:24:31] whatever we've had to go through but but
[1:24:33] but friends that's not our original
[1:24:35] position our original position is is to
[1:24:39] be the very image the very likeness of
[1:24:42] God hey man
[1:24:45] now you don't I've had a lot of nice
[1:24:47] animals in my life I've had goats and
[1:24:52] cattle and you know I've had I've had
[1:24:55] dogs I've had some in my lifetime I've
[1:24:59] had wonderful dogs when I was 50 I when
[1:25:02] I turned 50 if I could go back to my
[1:25:06] childhood my desire was to be a
[1:25:08] veterinarian so you know I loved I loved
[1:25:11] the animals so it was just an animal
[1:25:13] lover and I hated dog pounds I would I
[1:25:18] would curse everyone in my come by
[1:25:20] killing all them wonderful dogs I'm a
[1:25:25] little oh I'm a little older now I kind
[1:25:26] of
[1:25:27] now for animal control
[1:25:32] but you know but you know that they mom
[1:25:36] some family members called me Timmy dog
[1:25:39] because I love dogs so much I had a lot
[1:25:43] of wonderful dogs you know you can pet a
[1:25:46] dog you can just love a dog and talk to
[1:25:50] him
[1:25:51] fellowship with him tell him about
[1:25:53] everything he just wags his tail you
[1:25:58] know it looks up at you you know got a
[1:26:00] pretty little grin on his face his
[1:26:02] tongue lolling out his mouth and but you
[1:26:08] know fellows have been with a dog
[1:26:09] there's nothing like fellowship in with
[1:26:12] another human I can tell the human down
[1:26:17] to something and they understand
[1:26:18] something that I'm talking about I did
[1:26:22] Gordon you know in my tenure of
[1:26:24] raising dogs on I used to have kennels
[1:26:26] of them and so on and raise different
[1:26:29] breeds of them from beagles to rat
[1:26:31] terriers to hounds to everything I've
[1:26:33] been through it all and I I'd build a
[1:26:35] dog house and the dog would sit over
[1:26:39] there watch me build it I'd say okay
[1:26:43] yeah it's all finished
[1:26:45] don't wouldn't get in that thing I'd
[1:26:49] have to chain that dog to that thing the
[1:26:52] only one that would start raining or
[1:26:54] something will it finally run into it
[1:26:56] you get fixing up just as nice that dog
[1:26:59] wouldn't get in that thing for nothing
[1:27:01] because you know oh you could not convey
[1:27:05] to it what you were doing for it and the
[1:27:08] good it would bring a man but you see
[1:27:12] when you when you come to another human
[1:27:14] being it's somebody of your of an equal
[1:27:17] intelligence it's on the same lines of
[1:27:21] fellowship and this is what God is
[1:27:23] wanting to do with you is to elevate you
[1:27:26] to a place of a fellowship where that he
[1:27:31] you and him can have a fellowship
[1:27:33] together that you got things
[1:27:36] common you understand what is purple in
[1:27:40] his plan is and when he says I've made a
[1:27:42] heaven for you you want to go to that
[1:27:45] heaven and then you want to be a part of
[1:27:47] everything you has because he is telling
[1:27:50] you bringing things here up to you to
[1:27:52] share with you his innermost secrets and
[1:27:55] his secrets was you know before the
[1:27:59] world began I cared for you I've had you
[1:28:02] on my veranda I knew you were telling
[1:28:05] I've made plans for a honeymoon a man
[1:28:10] before the tribulation comes I've got a
[1:28:12] rapture promise for you I'm not gonna
[1:28:15] leave you here to fend for yourself but
[1:28:17] I got it escaped from the Laodicean age
[1:28:20] and there's gonna be a harvest in the
[1:28:23] last day and you're a part of that
[1:28:25] harvest you will not be left behind but
[1:28:28] you're gonna go with me and that's my
[1:28:30] spirit leads here you're leaving with me
[1:28:33] [Applause]
[1:28:36] the marriage supper of the Lamb

[1:28:44] exactly which one of you are coming and
[1:28:46] who you are planned for your place be
[1:28:51] one of my children listen there but even
[1:29:07] all of that I know there's gonna be some
[1:29:11] that you love left behind and I made a
[1:29:15] place for them too that after the
[1:29:19] tribulation is over I'm gonna take them
[1:29:23] into life also would you like to read
[1:29:26] that with me let's look in the book of
[1:29:29] Revelation and for this we'll find
[1:29:33] chapter 7 and verse 9 revelation 7 and I
[1:29:47] beheld and lo a great multitude which no
[1:29:52] man could number and look here there of
[1:29:56] all nations Kindred's people and tongues
[1:30:00] hey man don't you like that man that
[1:30:04] means and no matter what nationality are
[1:30:06] you know they're there and they stood
[1:30:09] before the throne and before the lamb
[1:30:11] and they were clothed with white robes
[1:30:13] and palms within the hands and the cried
[1:30:17] with a loud voice saying salvation to
[1:30:19] our God which sit upon the throne and
[1:30:21] unto the lamb you know the Angels stood
[1:30:25] round about the throne and about the
[1:30:26] elders and about and the four beasts and
[1:30:28] and fell before the throne and there on
[1:30:31] their faces and worship God saying hey
[1:30:34] man blessing and glory and wisdom and
[1:30:37] Thanksgiving and honour and power and
[1:30:39] might be under our God forever and ever
[1:30:43] amen
[1:30:45] and one of the elders answered and say
[1:30:47] unto me
[1:30:48] what are they these which are arrayed in
[1:30:51] white robes and whence came they now if
[1:30:55] we were to read the whole chapter we
[1:30:57] would have seen that from the from the
[1:31:00] different tribes the twelve tribes that
[1:31:02] were coming twelve thousand so there was
[1:31:04] 144,000 and he knew he recognized these
[1:31:07] these were Jewish people coming from the
[1:31:10] Jewish backgrounds but now notice in
[1:31:13] this that he's asked um you know who are
[1:31:17] these and John doesn't know he doesn't
[1:31:19] recognize these these are not a tribal
[1:31:23] people these are not Jews and he said
[1:31:26] sir thou knowest and he says these are
[1:31:29] they which came out of Great Tribulation
[1:31:33] and have washed their robes and made
[1:31:36] them white in the blood of the Lamb
[1:31:41] therefore there before notice this
[1:31:45] what's there presented there before the
[1:31:48] throne of God and serve Him day and
[1:31:52] night in his temple and he that sitteth
[1:31:55] on the throne shall dwell among them now
[1:31:58] I want you to notice this does not match
[1:32:01] the overcomers in the Laodicean age
[1:32:04] because they don't sit with because they
[1:32:09] sit with him on the throne look at
[1:32:11] revelation 3:21 real quick
[1:32:13] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:32:16] sit with me in my throne even as I
[1:32:20] overcame and I'm said that with my
[1:32:22] father in his throne so we see now this
[1:32:26] is a different even before the throne
[1:32:28] but the bride sits with him in the his
[1:32:32] throne and notice now as we go back to
[1:32:36] this revelation 7 they shall hunger no
[1:32:39] more neither thirst any more neither
[1:32:42] shall there be sunlight on them in on
[1:32:45] them nor any Heat for the languages in
[1:32:48] the midst of the throne shall feed them
[1:32:49] and shall lead them unto living
[1:32:53] fountains of waters and God shall wipe
[1:32:57] away all tears
[1:32:58] their eyes oh look how gentle he is for
[1:33:02] these look how loving he is like a
[1:33:05] shepherd but notice notice this after
[1:33:11] the tribulation is over because they
[1:33:14] have come out of Great Tribulation so
[1:33:16] this is the other side of the
[1:33:17] tribulation after the tribulation is
[1:33:20] over this group is seen cared for by the
[1:33:24] Lamb who leads them to living fountains
[1:33:27] of water which is eternal life so if you
[1:33:33] turn with me to John chapter 7 verse 38
[1:33:35] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[1:33:37] has said out of his belly shall flow
[1:33:40] rivers of living water for but this he
[1:33:44] spake of the Spirit which they will that
[1:33:47] believe on him should receive for the
[1:33:48] Holy Ghost was not yet given because
[1:33:50] Jesus was not yet glorified so what
[1:33:54] junior watch this very carefully these
[1:33:57] people had done works of sanctification
[1:34:00] in other words they had went through
[1:34:03] different stages of purification there
[1:34:06] had washed their robes in the blood of
[1:34:09] the Lamb and they were sanctified now
[1:34:13] listen carefully
[1:34:14] they were sanctified through their works
[1:34:17] of washing they were not given robes of
[1:34:23] righteousness but rather made their
[1:34:25] robes white by washing them in the blood
[1:34:28] of the Lamb now note this is different
[1:34:32] from the bride who did not get white
[1:34:34] robes by works but rather as a gift a
[1:34:38] royal granted you know with that final
[1:34:41] linen which is none other than the
[1:34:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost which is given
[1:34:46] by grace so turn with me to Revelation
[1:34:49] 19 and 7 let's just look and see the
[1:34:52] bride it's a royal grant that is given
[1:34:55] it's not works of sanctification where
[1:34:58] you know well I'm gonna quit this
[1:35:00] smoking or I'm gonna quit this drinking
[1:35:02] or I'm gonna lay down drugs or I'm gonna
[1:35:04] try to be good to my neighbor I'm gonna
[1:35:06] carry firewood to the widow woman I'm
[1:35:08] gonna do all these work
[1:35:10] and all that these are what this other
[1:35:12] group did they did works to purify
[1:35:16] themselves but this group it's just
[1:35:21] given back grace not something they
[1:35:27] earned but because of just the unmerited
[1:35:31] favor of God so he says in verse 7
[1:35:36] revelation 19:7 let us be glad and
[1:35:38] rejoice and give honour to him for the
[1:35:40] marriage of the lamb has come and his
[1:35:42] wife hath made herself ready and to her
[1:35:45] was granted that she should be arrayed
[1:35:49] in fine linen and that fine linen is
[1:35:52] exceedingly soft and dazzling white this
[1:35:55] linen would be sold for twice the price
[1:35:58] of gold viable she said to be arrayed in
[1:36:04] fine linen clean and white for fine
[1:36:06] linen is the righteousness of the saints
[1:36:10] so I want you to notice the difference
[1:36:12] notice one is working for purification
[1:36:16] going through steps you know I'll quit
[1:36:19] this and I'll reform here and I'll try
[1:36:23] to do right here and this other one he's
[1:36:26] not it's not works at all it's something
[1:36:30] just granted to them by the baptism of
[1:36:34] the Holy Ghost that brings them into his
[1:36:38] righteousness not their own
[1:36:41] righteousness in this group in
[1:36:49] Revelation 7 after the tribulation is
[1:36:53] over
[1:36:54] they are led into eternal life so
[1:36:58] they're believing unto but it's not
[1:37:02] until the white throne judgment when
[1:37:05] they're before the throne and are
[1:37:06] divided as the Sheep are from the goats
[1:37:08] and they're judged according to the
[1:37:11] deeds done in their bodies let me just
[1:37:14] get something clear you the Bride of
[1:37:16] Christ will never be judged for the
[1:37:18] deeds done in your body
[1:37:24] it's a home gone he took away your
[1:37:30] filthy rags and exchanged it for the
[1:37:34] greatest exchange that was ever and
[1:37:37] that's the righteousness of the saints
[1:37:41] so now we find that these had to go
[1:37:44] through the tribulation period for
[1:37:46] purification she has to be purged for
[1:37:49] sins of unbelief and rejecting the
[1:37:52] message so that the sleeping virgins had
[1:37:55] to go through the tribulation for more
[1:37:59] purification because it wasn't ready if
[1:38:02] you look back in the parable of the wise
[1:38:04] and the foolish then both are virgins
[1:38:07] and one goes into the marriage the other
[1:38:10] goes into we've been in wailing gnashing
[1:38:12] of teeth that go into great tribulation
[1:38:14] but both the virgins
[1:38:16] are you with me Amen the difference is
[1:38:20] one has oil one I don't have oil and the
[1:38:23] one has all goes into marriage the one
[1:38:25] who doesn't go through tribulation
[1:38:27] because they were dilatory come on
[1:38:31] slothful and somehow another did not
[1:38:36] prevail all the way into receiving the
[1:38:39] true baptism of the Holy Ghost so you
[1:38:42] see how important the Holy Ghost is a
[1:38:45] man now brother Branham would say she's
[1:38:49] not the bride
[1:38:50] but it's the church the pure people that
[1:38:53] didn't have the opportunity maybe to
[1:38:54] receive the message or in some way were
[1:38:57] blinded by these false prophets and they
[1:38:59] didn't get a chance but they were really
[1:39:01] sincere in their heart and God knows
[1:39:04] their heart and hear their purge during
[1:39:06] that time I'd say what a merciful God
[1:39:09] needs I'm going to rapture they're not
[1:39:12] in the honeymoon which is a millennium
[1:39:16] but they come at the white throne
[1:39:17] judgment where they're separated as a
[1:39:20] sheep from the goats again let me just
[1:39:23] share another little thing about it here
[1:39:25] he said these Tribulation Period Saints
[1:39:27] they come up went through Great
[1:39:28] Tribulation now the church will not go
[1:39:31] through the tribulation combat the bride
[1:39:34] see they're already in Gori and here's
[1:39:36] the tribulation Saints the sanctified
[1:39:38] ones being this mind are your fault and
[1:39:41] your fault did they never heard the word
[1:39:43] if they heard it and rejected it they
[1:39:46] went on to hell that was cast into outer
[1:39:48] darkness cause they rejected the word
[1:39:50] but if they would never have never heard
[1:39:53] it
[1:39:53] God is just the Tribulation Period comes
[1:39:56] to them notice the Saints are washed by
[1:39:59] the same word because it's the same
[1:40:00] altar now and but he said they're there
[1:40:04] because we never took their word to them
[1:40:07] that's the reason that was like that we
[1:40:09] never took the word to them we're going
[1:40:11] to be held responsible and we're and so
[1:40:13] will not be able to catch all the
[1:40:15] peoples the church won't in this age has
[1:40:17] got the truth because they'll go through
[1:40:19] the tribulation they're not the Saints
[1:40:21] that died way back yonder in them church
[1:40:23] changes cause he said they come out of
[1:40:25] Great Tribulation and the Great
[1:40:27] Tribulation is yet future after the
[1:40:29] church goes home so now they are those
[1:40:33] that come out of Great Tribulation now
[1:40:37] so they they stand up before the white
[1:40:40] throne judgment and remember the Saints
[1:40:44] the true Saints will judge the earth
[1:40:48] they will sit with him on his throne but
[1:40:51] there's gonna be multitudes brought
[1:40:53] before him during that time that will
[1:40:55] will be divided as the sheep are from
[1:40:59] the goats as a shepherd would separate
[1:41:01] the two species right so now they're
[1:41:05] separated like sheep from the goats the
[1:41:07] church members come up they've heard the
[1:41:10] truth if they've heard the truths
[1:41:11] rejected it then what's gonna be said
[1:41:13] when the great big things spread across
[1:41:15] the canvas when your own thoughts will
[1:41:17] be there when you thought about what you
[1:41:19] thought about it how are you going to
[1:41:21] escape and it's right there on the
[1:41:23] canvas so these are the skies and God's
[1:41:25] great television there's your only on
[1:41:27] tops rebelling right your own thoughts
[1:41:29] will speak against you in that hour so
[1:41:31] if you speak one thing and think another
[1:41:33] you better stop that get your tops on
[1:41:34] God and keep them pure stay right there
[1:41:36] and speak the same thing all the time
[1:41:38] they say well don't say well I believe
[1:41:40] it I say I'll say I believe it I'll go
[1:41:42] find out you believe it now deeds the
[1:41:45] reason
[1:41:45] they die out they go to the purging of
[1:41:47] the tribulation because they are not
[1:41:51] actually under the bud they claim they
[1:41:55] are but they're not so how can they go
[1:41:57] through a trial to purify them with the
[1:41:59] blood of bleached blood of Jesus Christ
[1:42:02] take several symptoms and sin and step
[1:42:05] away from you and you're already dead
[1:42:06] your life is here than God in him
[1:42:09] through God and sealed in there by the
[1:42:11] Holy Ghost what are you gonna be just
[1:42:12] for what's your from purification what
[1:42:15] do you have to be purified from when
[1:42:16] you're already perfectly in Christ
[1:42:18] sinless
[1:42:19] what's the judgment for but they're
[1:42:20] sleeping but is what think the people
[1:42:22] can can't make out so now what we're
[1:42:26] trying to tell you today is that's what
[1:42:29] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost does
[1:42:32] for you it removes ever symptom of sin a
[1:42:38] man and it'll lead you into all truth
[1:42:43] now how is it that they're not truly
[1:42:46] under the blood this is a group of
[1:42:48] people that are watching the robes in
[1:42:50] the blood the lamb but they're still you
[1:42:53] know doing things to to be purified
[1:42:56] because they're not now this is gonna
[1:43:01] stumble some they are not fully
[1:43:03] born-again they have just gone through
[1:43:07] some of the requirements of the birth
[1:43:10] like believing on the Lord confessing
[1:43:12] him as Savior and maybe doesn't work so
[1:43:15] sanctification but they have not been
[1:43:18] filled with the spirit now remember the
[1:43:22] difference between between the church
[1:43:25] and the bride is gonna be the token
[1:43:28] that's going to be the difference both
[1:43:31] of my virgins both of them good people
[1:43:33] both of them at their names in the book
[1:43:36] of life somebody with me even in the
[1:43:40] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:43:41] their names are there in my boat but the
[1:43:43] difference is is one has the Holy Ghost
[1:43:46] and what doesn't and because of that one
[1:43:50] is the bride
[1:43:51] because she has his life and has the
[1:43:53] spirit and the other his great mercy has
[1:43:59] rude their blindness and gave them life
[1:44:05] I say what a merciful God now let's just
[1:44:12] talk about this minute because again
[1:44:16] meaning or call themselves born again
[1:44:19] when they're not truly born again or
[1:44:22] maybe they just started in the initial
[1:44:24] steps of the new birth let's look at it
[1:44:30] this way let's go back to the origin of
[1:44:33] the church the origin of the churches on
[1:44:36] the day of Pentecost that's where she
[1:44:40] was born of the Spirit of God and and
[1:44:44] there she was a born-again Church so
[1:44:48] remember this was a very new thing the
[1:44:51] Old Testament Jews knew nothing about a
[1:44:53] new birth this is why you know in the
[1:44:58] Old Testament laws if you were born
[1:45:00] because of a sinful birthless a bastard
[1:45:03] child whoa you know you were you were
[1:45:07] never allowed into the congregation of
[1:45:09] the children of Israel and into the
[1:45:12] temple worship you wasn't accepting than
[1:45:15] in ten generations it would take to
[1:45:17] breathe that one sin out so it was a
[1:45:21] horrible thing adultery was so bad in
[1:45:25] the eyes of God and remember God had a
[1:45:28] plan he wanted to have a people that
[1:45:31] through he could bring a virgin and a
[1:45:33] virgin would conceive he wasn't going to
[1:45:35] find that among the Gentiles because sex
[1:45:38] was in their religion as they did there
[1:45:40] are drunken orgies and things around
[1:45:42] their gods they they participate in
[1:45:44] sexual acts so there wasn't that that
[1:45:47] was there was no no such thing as purity
[1:45:50] among the Gentiles so you don't free
[1:45:54] even the Gentiles be saved it was going
[1:45:55] to say something different because we
[1:45:58] didn't have a lineage of ten generations
[1:45:59] to breed out all the call amen somebody
[1:46:04] with me Amen so Jesus introduced a new
[1:46:08] doctor and that doctor was you mouth
[1:46:11] be born again well you thought they
[1:46:15] thought would just reborn to the seed of
[1:46:17] Abraham that's good enough to be
[1:46:19] Abraham's sons and his offspring that's
[1:46:22] God's chosen people that's good enough
[1:46:24] but Nicodemus is told no you've reached
[1:46:26] a time that is not gonna work just to be
[1:46:29] born in the lineage of Abraham you must
[1:46:32] be born again
[1:46:34] there it is required that there's a new
[1:46:36] birth that births you out of sin and
[1:46:40] into righteousness so they started out
[1:46:45] everybody knew what the new birth was it
[1:46:47] was the receiving of the life of God
[1:46:49] when the Holy Spirit came in the church
[1:46:52] that was the breath of God then he come
[1:46:54] into the church on the day of Pentecost
[1:46:56] nobody was confused and when when they
[1:47:00] asked Peter what shall we do he says
[1:47:02] repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:47:05] in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:47:07] remission of sin and you shall receive
[1:47:09] the gift of the Holy Ghost for the
[1:47:11] promises to you and to your children and
[1:47:14] that them that are fall even as many as
[1:47:16] the Lord our God shall call you see
[1:47:19] there was no confusion everybody knew
[1:47:22] what it meant to be born again but it
[1:47:24] didn't take long for as a church this
[1:47:27] planet remember it would be planted as a
[1:47:29] seed and that seed a seed deteriorates
[1:47:32] and it begins to break down and life
[1:47:35] comes out of it and the old seed rots
[1:47:37] away and how comes as shoot and it
[1:47:40] doesn't look anything like the grain but
[1:47:42] it still is still the wheat is till the
[1:47:44] church but it don't look anything like
[1:47:46] the original and this began to happen in
[1:47:49] the early church the first thing you
[1:47:51] know the church isn't look like what
[1:47:53] they were on the day of Pentecost they
[1:47:55] were they were still the church that God
[1:47:58] called as his eyes his own and God is
[1:48:00] still moving on and sin and revival
[1:48:02] Sinden is his holy spirit reign upon
[1:48:05] them but still at the same time they
[1:48:07] don't look anything like the seed
[1:48:10] because that's not going to come until
[1:48:13] you come back to harvest again and it
[1:48:15] harvest there's gonna be a group of
[1:48:17] people who will look exactly like to see
[1:48:19] that was
[1:48:22] but yet it's the bride all the way
[1:48:24] through is God's church all the way
[1:48:26] through their me a resurrection for all
[1:48:28] of them all the way through they man but
[1:48:32] now it wasn't long until the devil began
[1:48:36] to get in the book of Acts church there
[1:48:40] were people that were bypassing the new
[1:48:42] birth in Acts chapter 15 and I chapter
[1:48:46] 15 there was people bypassing the new
[1:48:49] birth bye-bye there were Pharisees which
[1:48:52] believed so how did they remain
[1:48:55] Pharisees and still be a believer that
[1:48:57] had died to the teachings of man and
[1:49:01] their own ideas and they were trying to
[1:49:03] incorporate their past thoughts into the
[1:49:06] new message so therefore they would
[1:49:09] hybridize or change to try to change the
[1:49:12] the gospel Paul would call it a
[1:49:16] bewitching he say this actually
[1:49:17] witchcraft is a demonic influence that
[1:49:21] is trying to take you away from the
[1:49:23] original gospel and he said if you
[1:49:25] preach anything other than what I
[1:49:27] preached you you be a curse for of an
[1:49:30] angel would come from heaven and preach
[1:49:32] any other gospel than what I preached
[1:49:33] let him be accursed
[1:49:35] but what would begin to happen now as
[1:49:38] these poor people received the Holy
[1:49:41] Ghost on the day of Pentecost I say poor
[1:49:44] meaning they were impoverished it wasn't
[1:49:46] wealthy the wealthy of the land
[1:49:48] you know they heard the message preached
[1:49:51] 3,000 were saved
[1:49:53] a man outta to the church and filled
[1:49:57] with the Holy Ghost and in the house of
[1:49:59] Cornelius and Gentiles were saved and
[1:50:01] mothers revival going on and the Holy
[1:50:04] Spirit is moving and there's miracles
[1:50:06] and there's signs and there's wonders
[1:50:08] and the Holy Ghost is he is filling
[1:50:11] people and they're speaking in other
[1:50:13] tongues and they're shouting rejoicing
[1:50:15] they're there they're getting the same
[1:50:17] experience that they did on the day of
[1:50:19] Pentecost see everybody with me right
[1:50:21] now but it wasn't long until you know
[1:50:25] they as these were these miracles were
[1:50:29] being witnessed and the EM were seen you
[1:50:32] know that the
[1:50:34] asses of these people as say with would
[1:50:36] see them and say yeah take me to I want
[1:50:40] some of that I want to go to that church
[1:50:41] and and they would embrace Christianity
[1:50:44] and they'd go down to you know where
[1:50:46] they were in meetings in that little
[1:50:48] dark dingy hall and clapped their hands
[1:50:51] and shout and speaking in tongues and
[1:50:53] I'm quoting from the second seal here
[1:50:55] and he said in getting messages and said
[1:50:58] why he could never take that to his
[1:51:01] competitors are his associates or
[1:51:03] whatever in his business he could never
[1:51:05] believe it like that certainly not he's
[1:51:07] got to dress it up so they begin to get
[1:51:10] together and say we'll form a little
[1:51:12] something different and so Jesus would
[1:51:16] call this the deeds of the Nicolaitans
[1:51:19] he said there's a spirit that is coming
[1:51:22] to conquer validity and to overcome the
[1:51:28] laity now all these are Bible terms you
[1:51:30] find that in the book of Revelation so
[1:51:32] you see to overcome the laity you see
[1:51:36] they wanted to take out of the church
[1:51:38] the resurrection Lord Jesus with signs
[1:51:41] and wonders among the believers and just
[1:51:45] change them over into formalism you
[1:51:48] don't kind of dress it up make it where
[1:51:50] the rest of the Society of the church
[1:51:52] couldn't receive that you know it'd be a
[1:51:55] little easier to swallow if everybody
[1:51:57] wasn't shouting and rejoicing and and
[1:51:59] speaking in other tongues and messages
[1:52:02] come in like that list let's kind of
[1:52:04] listen let's have a dignified Church and
[1:52:07] so the devil dim winds up getting in the
[1:52:10] book of Acts Church you know and begins
[1:52:13] to take away the power of God the signs
[1:52:16] and the wonders remove all the emotion
[1:52:19] from the pew amen
[1:52:23] take even the a man's out of it and then
[1:52:26] place it all up on a holy ministry amen
[1:52:30] where the priest does all it does
[1:52:32] everything and and whatever can forgive
[1:52:34] you of your sins they can lay you know
[1:52:37] bring you in or keep you out they will
[1:52:39] be the mediator between you and God
[1:52:41] sounds like some of these backslidden
[1:52:43] message people that want to preach today
[1:52:47] amen trying to say you know that that
[1:52:49] now that they can be the intercessor
[1:52:50] you're nothing more than a Catholic but
[1:52:53] again you see begin but again they were
[1:52:57] getting to lose the truth of the new
[1:53:00] birth and the Catholics would reduce it
[1:53:03] further but simply the new birth number
[1:53:06] can begin to mean that we just born into
[1:53:10] a Catholic family now if you're not
[1:53:13] careful the same thought can be passed
[1:53:17] along that I'm in the message you know
[1:53:20] I'm born again this because I'm born
[1:53:22] into a message family and men physical
[1:53:27] birth will only birth you into sin it'll
[1:53:30] never birth you into life every person
[1:53:35] must have his own chance at the word and
[1:53:39] meant to receive a reject the word and
[1:53:42] meant to have their own revival and so
[1:53:46] it doesn't come because my daddy was a
[1:53:49] Christian and my granddaddy was a
[1:53:50] Christian so I'm a Christian no the only
[1:53:53] way you can be a child of God is to be
[1:53:57] born of God by the Holy Spirit so again
[1:54:01] you know it would be reduced I mean
[1:54:04] would be until I you know if you're born
[1:54:07] in this family where you're a Christian
[1:54:08] because everybody in this family is a
[1:54:10] Christian well then Luther come along
[1:54:13] and said but you know the just or the
[1:54:16] righteous selling of my faith and and
[1:54:21] this became his message as he got a
[1:54:25] realization but it's not being born
[1:54:27] physically in the church you've got to
[1:54:29] have you gotta have faith in Christ and
[1:54:32] the Luther came out of the Gallic Church
[1:54:35] and received that revelation so he
[1:54:37] taught that faith was the new birth
[1:54:41] death for you were justified or declared
[1:54:45] righteous by faith now so again
[1:54:50] now it's not been born into the gathered
[1:54:53] churches a new birth but now they
[1:54:54] understand you've got to believe on
[1:54:56] Christ to be born again amen
[1:55:00] now Wesley would come along John Wesley
[1:55:03] in the Methodist movement he would teach
[1:55:05] sanctification but there's got to be a
[1:55:07] sanctified life that goes with this so
[1:55:10] he recalled this the second blessing he
[1:55:13] taught that a holy life must come with
[1:55:16] believing on Christ and after you
[1:55:18] believe then you become sanctified so
[1:55:22] now now it is understood to be born
[1:55:25] again means to I must be um I must
[1:55:28] believe in Christ and I must live a holy
[1:55:31] life and then the Pentecostals
[1:55:33] especially the Assembly of God which was
[1:55:36] the first part of the movement of the
[1:55:38] penalty Azusa Street revival they taught
[1:55:41] after that you were saved by believing
[1:55:43] but then you receive your added power
[1:55:46] after receiving the Holy Ghost now I
[1:55:51] didn't want to say to you in all of
[1:55:53] these things and all the denominations
[1:55:56] out there the truth of it is people many
[1:56:00] people are believing on Christ and some
[1:56:04] summer like you said they're just there
[1:56:07] cause a family member but some have a
[1:56:09] absolute perfection of faith they have
[1:56:12] professed Jesus Christ as their Savior
[1:56:16] and they have accepted him as Lord of
[1:56:18] their life and so they have believed on
[1:56:22] him but but again I want you to
[1:56:25] understand believing is not the same as
[1:56:29] receiving because you must be born again
[1:56:34] by receiving the Holy Spirit in your
[1:56:38] life you're not truly converted until
[1:56:41] you receive the Holy Ghost as they did
[1:56:44] on the day of Pentecost
[1:56:46] now the Evangelic alieve that you
[1:56:49] receive the Holy Ghost the moment you
[1:56:50] profess Christ as your personal Savior
[1:56:53] you got the Spirit of God you know don't
[1:56:56] all scheme this is a common prayer of
[1:56:58] his and this is what he does he says you
[1:57:02] know you just say Lord Jesus I repent of
[1:57:04] my sins
[1:57:05] come into my heart wash me clean I'm
[1:57:07] making my Lord and Savior amen
[1:57:09] and then he says we believe if you
[1:57:11] prayed that simple prayer
[1:57:12] born again so to them that's to be born
[1:57:15] again that you just repeated this simple
[1:57:19] prayer after somebody else and said I
[1:57:22] make you my Lord and Savior wash me
[1:57:25] clean come into my heart and the Romans
[1:57:29] 10 and 9 does say I'm gonna give this
[1:57:32] that thou if thou shalt confess with thy
[1:57:35] mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe
[1:57:38] in thine heart that God has raised him
[1:57:41] from the dead thou shalt be saved for
[1:57:46] with the heart man believeth unto
[1:57:48] righteousness and with the mouth
[1:57:51] confession is made unto salvation so I
[1:57:56] want you to notice thou shall be saved
[1:57:59] and the confession is made unto
[1:58:02] salvation
[1:58:04] it is not salvation to confess Jesus and
[1:58:09] Lord and Savior and ask him into your
[1:58:11] heart is a good beginning if it's done
[1:58:15] in sincerity but you must continue on to
[1:58:19] salvation amen that's what you believe
[1:58:22] when you accept Christ as your personal
[1:58:24] Savior you're believing on to the
[1:58:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost but that's not
[1:58:29] the baptism of the Holy Ghost a man
[1:58:33] salvations thought to me you know for
[1:58:37] one to be saved
[1:58:38] in their sin rather than from their sin
[1:58:41] you know Peter let's just go to him for
[1:58:44] a minute Peter knew by divine revelation
[1:58:48] that Jesus was the Christ the Son of the
[1:58:52] Living God
[1:58:53] hey man since he he professed him as
[1:58:56] Savior as Messiah the one who comes to
[1:59:00] save man and it was by divine revelation
[1:59:03] but he didn't get the Holy Ghost I'm to
[1:59:06] Pentecost are you with me now so the
[1:59:10] mean you see I'm here was Peter he had
[1:59:14] followed him for three years he had his
[1:59:16] name on the Lamb's Book of Life he had
[1:59:19] cast out devils he done great works he'd
[1:59:22] healed he preached the word
[1:59:24] everything but he still wasn't converted
[1:59:27] because you see you're leading to
[1:59:30] conversion you see the Bible said that
[1:59:33] he that cometh to God must believe so
[1:59:36] that's the first part
[1:59:37] you must believe and man you must
[1:59:41] believe that he is and that he will
[1:59:44] reward those who diligently seek Him
[1:59:48] amen so the first parts of it is you
[1:59:51] must believe you're not going to get the
[1:59:54] first base without believing and I want
[1:59:57] to say to you who I believe
[1:59:59] congratulations you got the first base
[2:00:02] hey man but you gotta keep on moving
[2:00:05] you can't camp down there there's more
[2:00:08] to it than just believing you must
[2:00:11] receive after you believe hey man now
[2:00:16] it's like leading to conversion now
[2:00:18] Jesus typed it as a birth so in the
[2:00:21] birth there is a conception so the
[2:00:23] conception is first but no baby yet
[2:00:26] right although it's a life and we
[2:00:30] believe it people sincerely die in that
[2:00:34] condition and you never having a chance
[2:00:36] to to go on with God and receive the
[2:00:39] Holy Ghost we believe that person will
[2:00:42] will be saved that there's a place in
[2:00:44] heaven for them but friends to be a part
[2:00:47] of the bride I want to get it back to
[2:00:49] you you're gonna have to have the Holy
[2:00:51] Ghost to go in the rapture there is a
[2:00:53] difference God is making a difference
[2:00:56] between the church and the bride in this
[2:00:58] day and then because now the word has
[2:01:02] been restored now so you see when I when
[2:01:06] a baby is concerned conceived in the
[2:01:09] womb and then it's developed and it's in
[2:01:11] the second stage but the baby has to be
[2:01:13] born and when that baby is born it
[2:01:17] receives the breath of life now we can't
[2:01:21] say there wasn't life there before but
[2:01:23] there's a different life than that life
[2:01:27] hey ma'am now Peter had believed on the
[2:01:30] Lord he had confess him as Christ but he
[2:01:33] wasn't yet converted let's just look
[2:01:35] here
[2:01:36] Luke chapter 21 - in verse 31 said Simon
[2:01:41] Simon behold Satan hath desired you that
[2:01:44] he may sift you as wheat but I have
[2:01:47] prayed for thee that thy faith fail not
[2:01:49] and when thou I converted strengthen thy
[2:01:53] brother when you're converted
[2:01:57] what do you mean Lord our God the one
[2:01:59] that got the revelation doctrine crisis
[2:02:02] send the Living God flesh and blood has
[2:02:04] not revealed this to you Simon but my
[2:02:06] father which is in heaven
[2:02:07] he's revealed this to you and on this
[2:02:09] rock I build my church and the gates of
[2:02:11] Hell shall not prevail against it
[2:02:14] because every person must have that that
[2:02:18] first rock confession of who Jesus is a
[2:02:24] man that he came to seek and save that
[2:02:27] which was lost and he's my Savior
[2:02:30] he asserted for my Redemption his blood
[2:02:33] was shed for me so I can be filled with
[2:02:36] his spirit but he said but when you are
[2:02:40] converted strengthen your brethren now
[2:02:46] during this time of sifting the trash
[2:02:50] was exposed in his life you know this if
[2:02:53] that week was like winnowing the grain
[2:02:55] you take it you throw it up in the air
[2:02:58] the grain falls down the chaff gets
[2:03:01] blowed away the trash gets lotus-eyed
[2:03:04] right hey man so I wouldn't I won't just
[2:03:09] get something me oh the sifting in the
[2:03:12] world that Satan could do - Peter could
[2:03:17] not make him not be great
[2:03:24] it couldn't change him from being
[2:03:28] drained only thing that happened would
[2:03:32] be exposed to chaff and blow that away
[2:03:37] hey ma'am but when Peter come down to it
[2:03:41] you know when the trash wood was exposed
[2:03:44] in his life he would denied the Lord
[2:03:47] three times and he would curse and say I
[2:03:51] know not the man and then he would weep
[2:03:55] bitterly about ho he would be so
[2:03:57] sorrowful he he would be so repented
[2:04:00] I've sinned again I I've done it again
[2:04:03] sounds like a lot of people in their
[2:04:05] Christian experience they have a
[2:04:08] confession of faith but they're truly
[2:04:11] not yet converted because when on a bond
[2:04:14] they'll deny the Lord and by their
[2:04:16] actions say I know not the man and then
[2:04:20] that we bitterly because with all their
[2:04:23] good intentions in the trial they have a
[2:04:27] bit chilly over and over again deny the
[2:04:29] Lord there's so many believers like
[2:04:33] Peter are you with me that go through
[2:04:38] this over and over and over again they
[2:04:40] they than when the time of sifting it's
[2:04:44] discovered when the winds of trial blows
[2:04:47] the evil is is discovered that has been
[2:04:51] clinging to their lives and is exposed
[2:04:53] and they've come I know not the man now
[2:05:00] come to that point of denial now there
[2:05:07] had to have to be something that would
[2:05:09] happened to that Christ denying cussin
[2:05:13] preacher Simon Peter and on the day of
[2:05:19] Pentecost it changed forever
[2:05:24] because what had been conceived by
[2:05:27] believing on the Lord that was birthed
[2:05:30] in the sonship and the life of God came
[2:05:35] into him by the baptism of the Holy
[2:05:38] Ghost and you never find a hair from
[2:05:41] that point on a cussin lying the nappy
[2:05:45] Christ denying Peter but you see
[2:05:49] somebody in the face of adversity in the
[2:05:52] face of imprisonment his talent is is
[2:05:55] gone there's a holy boldness in his life
[2:05:57] there's a power that lays within him
[2:06:00] that no matter what he faces never never
[2:06:03] never again will he ever deny the Lord
[2:06:06] because now he is converted changed
[2:06:09] forever
[2:06:14] we got churches full of Peters today hey
[2:06:19] man I'm not saying that all they're not
[2:06:22] good people are sincere or even didn't
[2:06:24] didn't have a real sincere confession of
[2:06:28] faith and believe on the Lord and accept
[2:06:30] him as Savior and really believe on that
[2:06:32] but there's something still needs to
[2:06:34] happen to change them because this Holy
[2:06:40] Spirit when he comes he seals you to the
[2:06:44] day of redemption ah you know so now on
[2:06:51] the day of Pentecost he's given the key
[2:06:54] to the kingdom Peter said repent and be
[2:06:57] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[2:07:00] a remission of sin and you shall receive
[2:07:02] the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:07:03] Paul said have you received the Holy
[2:07:05] Ghost since you have believed this is a
[2:07:08] hold of our problem right here people
[2:07:10] pretend of their sins that get baptized
[2:07:13] in water but they don't go on and
[2:07:15] receive the Holy Ghost you believe I'm
[2:07:17] to receiving the spirit believing on
[2:07:21] Jesus is a step in the right direction
[2:07:23] which is toward the Holy Ghost but
[2:07:25] people stop there they go as far as the
[2:07:28] water and then stop they believe and
[2:07:30] then
[2:07:30] stop and this is where you find him in
[2:07:33] Acts chapter 19 they had been baptized
[2:07:36] by John the Baptist that's a pretty good
[2:07:37] person to be baptized by don't you think
[2:07:39] they had believed but yet but but had
[2:07:43] yet to receive the Holy Ghost for they
[2:07:44] said we didn't know there was to be such
[2:07:46] a thing as a Holy Ghost we we thought
[2:07:49] just believing on the Lord was enough we
[2:07:52] just stopped being believing it baptized
[2:07:54] and was was all we need and he said
[2:07:56] we'll have you received only your sense
[2:07:58] you have believed now this is the
[2:08:01] question comes right down to it and it's
[2:08:04] the question that's going to make the
[2:08:06] difference between the church and the
[2:08:08] bride and then because the the the one
[2:08:11] has believed that church going through
[2:08:14] the tribulation has believed on the Lord
[2:08:15] unto salvation but has not yet been
[2:08:19] converted and the other has been
[2:08:21] converted by receiving the baptism of
[2:08:24] the Holy Ghost therefore they can go
[2:08:26] into rapture they have the oil in their
[2:08:29] vessels with their lamps they're not
[2:08:31] just professors and they're not just
[2:08:33] cleaned up people sometimes we think
[2:08:37] that's what we got to do we just clean
[2:08:38] people up get them to change the way
[2:08:40] they dress the way they talk you know
[2:08:42] you quit using your extremities you you
[2:08:45] start doing this and you reform them it
[2:08:47] isn't a reclamation it's a
[2:08:50] transformation they have no power for
[2:08:57] they stopped short of Pentecost and
[2:08:59] that's the thing now brother Branham
[2:09:03] would explain this about the red heifer
[2:09:05] how God made a way of faretta
[2:09:07] reconciliation and the Old Testament and
[2:09:10] that was you would God would instruct
[2:09:12] him to take a red heifer heifer without
[2:09:15] blemish and there they would taken would
[2:09:20] burn her with was with scarlet and with
[2:09:22] with cedar all of these reds the Reds
[2:09:26] the red thread there were the red cedar
[2:09:30] and then the red heifer and it would
[2:09:33] burn them together to make a water of
[2:09:35] separation and this was so that there
[2:09:39] would be a cleansing so that they could
[2:09:41] come into the tabernacle
[2:09:43] and in the presence of God so the first
[2:09:46] thing a sinner does is he comes and he
[2:09:48] hears the word faith comes by hearing
[2:09:50] and hearing the Word of God so he comes
[2:09:54] to be convicted that he's a sinner and
[2:09:56] he's without God so no matter how long
[2:09:59] he's going to church that don't mean
[2:10:01] anything all these all this all these
[2:10:04] things has a spiritual meaning well you
[2:10:06] know because listen anybody can come in
[2:10:10] and get baptized hey man let somebody
[2:10:14] baptism but water will never wash away
[2:10:16] your sins you know who can you know
[2:10:19] you've have them stand up and we can
[2:10:22] even sprinkle a little anybody could and
[2:10:24] a little water on you holy water will
[2:10:26] cleanse you it won't mean won't save you
[2:10:29] people can make a cold and drive
[2:10:32] profession say and I believe that Jesus
[2:10:34] Christ is the son of God well every
[2:10:37] devil in Hell believes he's the son of
[2:10:38] God hey man but the coming to church is
[2:10:43] good attending church still won't make
[2:10:46] you a Christian any more than going to a
[2:10:49] barn
[2:10:49] makes your horse you know but really to
[2:10:53] come and fellowship with God means you
[2:10:55] accept the blood it's been applied in
[2:10:57] your heart but the baptism of the Holy
[2:10:59] Ghost and you become not just a partner
[2:11:02] with God but you become in relationship
[2:11:05] with God a son and daughter of God
[2:11:07] hey man now so you see is good to come
[2:11:11] to church it's good to be baptized but
[2:11:14] everyone coming into divine fellowship
[2:11:17] with Christ he has to he has to
[2:11:20] recognize that before him when Jesus
[2:11:22] Christ with his own blood sprinkled away
[2:11:24] put the stripes on the glad and went in
[2:11:27] not like Aaron with the blood of an
[2:11:29] animal but with his own blood and he
[2:11:31] stands in the presence of God tonight
[2:11:33] right now make an intercession amen so
[2:11:38] let me tell you you know you and the
[2:11:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost you you are in
[2:11:43] the presence of God you are in the
[2:11:45] holiest of Holies you're in the presence
[2:11:47] of the Shekinah and that's why that we
[2:11:50] know the lamb hasn't let the mercy seat
[2:11:52] because where I am the Lambs there
[2:11:55] a man where I am healing is there I can
[2:11:59] see he was wounded for my transgressions
[2:12:01] he was bruised for my iniquity the
[2:12:04] chastisement of my peace was upon him
[2:12:06] and by His stripes I am healed hey man
[2:12:10] she's sitting right there and brother
[2:12:12] he'll make good anything we confess to
[2:12:15] be true and that'll make demons tremble
[2:12:18] sinners come to life when they recognize
[2:12:20] we have an intercessor that we have a
[2:12:23] God there that will do more than just
[2:12:26] shake your hand and bring you into the
[2:12:28] fellowship of the church but bring you
[2:12:30] in the fellowship with Christ a man
[2:12:32] that'll satisfy that loneliness is in
[2:12:35] the heart of God a man
[2:12:38] plunging beneath the blood now let's
[2:12:42] just go to a principle in the scripture
[2:12:44] I've got a little more time but in John
[2:12:47] chapter 3 let's just look there you can
[2:12:50] turn there it starts with you know where
[2:12:53] Jesus begins to talk to Nicodemus you
[2:12:56] must be born again and he would say you
[2:13:00] must be born of the water and of the
[2:13:03] Spirit so the water is the word we are
[2:13:09] cleansed by so now notice it's a great
[2:13:14] thing to come to the water part and that
[2:13:18] water part the new birth and get washed
[2:13:21] and the wants from all your sins washed
[2:13:25] from all the false doctrines and
[2:13:28] embraced truth that's one part of the
[2:13:30] birth but like brother Branham said
[2:13:33] don't just come this far and say I
[2:13:35] believe the message you must have the
[2:13:38] token the Holy Ghost and that's the
[2:13:41] breath of God so you see again he would
[2:13:45] say in and in John he would make any
[2:13:49] plain the Spirit is the breath to be
[2:13:53] bored of the Spirit is to be born of the
[2:13:56] breath of God for Jesus immediately
[2:13:59] we'll we'll talk about after the new
[2:14:02] birth he'll describe the wind as as the
[2:14:05] breath and then and John 20
[2:14:07] verse 22 he said when he said this he
[2:14:10] breathed on them and said unto them
[2:14:13] receive ye the Holy Ghost so jesus knew
[2:14:18] that coming to the spirit as of birth
[2:14:20] and he likened it as to a wind that the
[2:14:25] that the new birth of his offspring
[2:14:27] would be to be born of the breath of God
[2:14:32] are you with me so he said Marvel not I
[2:14:35] say that you must be born again verse a
[2:14:37] the wind bloweth where it listeth and
[2:14:40] thou hearest the sound thereof but
[2:14:43] cannot tell where it cometh and whither
[2:14:44] it goeth and so is every one that is
[2:14:46] born of the Spirit and then on the day
[2:14:49] of Pentecost it came it came like a
[2:14:52] rushing mighty wind hallelujah and when
[2:14:57] the high priest didn't know where he
[2:14:59] come from
[2:15:00] it certainly didn't come from them the
[2:15:03] Pharisees didn't know where he come from
[2:15:04] it hadn't come from them they didn't
[2:15:07] know where this wind came from but from
[2:15:10] him from his own beers came a breath
[2:15:14] among the breath of life and feel the
[2:15:18] church and for the first time in all of
[2:15:23] history was a redeemed son by the blood
[2:15:28] the lamp burned up the Spirit of God and
[2:15:32] on the day of Pentecost it was a hundred
[2:15:35] and twenty initially that would be born
[2:15:38] of the breath of God God breathed the
[2:15:42] breath of life into them and now that
[2:15:45] life into them was kids life and that
[2:15:48] breath into that church was his breath
[2:15:51] so therefore the power that was in him
[2:15:54] was in them a man and the healing that
[2:15:57] was in him was in them and the signs
[2:16:00] that was in him was in them and
[2:16:02] everything that he was they were because
[2:16:05] he breathe
[2:16:06] like his old life his old breath and
[2:16:10] amber and they became a new creation
[2:16:17] they became a divine species they became
[2:16:21] God man
[2:16:22] they became God and dwelt a man and they
[2:16:26] went out and did exactly what Jesus did
[2:16:28] a man they went out of a room with the
[2:16:31] spirit and action
[2:16:32] they were Jesus men and women they
[2:16:35] raised the dead they discerned the
[2:16:37] hearts they cast out Devils they healed
[2:16:39] the sick
[2:16:39] they spoke peace to the center they
[2:16:41] showed God to the world somebody help me
[2:16:45] preach now this is what happened on the
[2:16:48] day of Pentecost they became God breed
[2:16:53] now let's just see what he what he says
[2:16:59] this about you he says as a man God
[2:17:04] makes you to be a ruler over all things
[2:17:07] so this clearly means all things a man
[2:17:09] born on the breath of God is the word of
[2:17:12] God they came from his thoughts as Jesus
[2:17:16] did then they reach a point in time and
[2:17:19] he breathed life into them John says
[2:17:22] beloved now we are the sons of God Paul
[2:17:27] would use Old Testament Scriptures to
[2:17:29] prove to us our sonship and he says in
[2:17:32] some 2222 I'll declare that name unto my
[2:17:36] brethren in the midst of the
[2:17:38] congregation will I praise thee so I'll
[2:17:40] declare thy name unto my brethren God
[2:17:44] has brethren what I'm trying to tell you
[2:17:47] is he calls you family that you're a
[2:17:50] kinfolk somebody help me preach Isaiah
[2:17:54] 818 for I behold I and the children whom
[2:17:58] the lord hath given me are for signs and
[2:18:00] wonders in israel from the lord of hosts
[2:18:02] with dwelleth in mount zion zion the
[2:18:05] children who the lord hath given Ron
[2:18:08] Paul said in Romans 8:29 for whom he did
[2:18:11] foreknow them he also did predestinate
[2:18:17] to be conformed to the image of his son
[2:18:20] that means to be made to be made to the
[2:18:24] same essence of his character hallelujah
[2:18:28] Amen that he might be a somebody help me
[2:18:31] say this firstborn among many brethren
[2:18:38] so God's great design was not just to
[2:18:41] have Jesus as his son come on
[2:18:45] but to have many sons many daughters a
[2:18:48] man that would be God breeds just like
[2:18:51] him hallelujah that would come from from
[2:18:55] his thoughts in the word hallelujah and
[2:18:58] the word in the manifestation are you
[2:19:01] with me now
[2:19:02] a man so Jesus calls us brethren he be
[2:19:05] God became a brother to man when he took
[2:19:07] on humanity so that we as man can become
[2:19:10] a brother to God and He calls his family
[2:19:13] you're his family look over look over at
[2:19:17] somebody and say I'm part of God's
[2:19:19] family amen
[2:19:21] he calls you ever family title there he
[2:19:23] is look at the Bible because he bride
[2:19:26] wife
[2:19:28] sons daughters brethren ever ever
[2:19:35] favorite title of a relationship of
[2:19:38] family time title he gives it to you a
[2:19:42] man
[2:19:43] oh my listen and not only that he
[2:19:46] stooped down to us to pick us up and
[2:19:49] elevate us to sonship when you and I
[2:19:53] were lost a man and in dirty garments
[2:19:56] somebody help me preach now he made it a
[2:19:59] greatest exchange for your life he he
[2:20:02] made it were that you could be arrayed
[2:20:03] in white linen clean and white image
[2:20:07] which is the righteousness of this age
[2:20:09] is that right for the Bible said he made
[2:20:12] him to be sin for us who knew no sin
[2:20:14] that we might be made the righteousness
[2:20:16] of God in him
[2:20:19] so he stooped down because God's mindful
[2:20:23] of us
[2:20:24] he was so mindful of this generation
[2:20:27] that we've been through 2,000 years of
[2:20:30] church history until the gospel has been
[2:20:31] diluted and watered down with men's
[2:20:34] theology but we returned back to the
[2:20:36] land of the Holy Ghost a man that is not
[2:20:39] just an anointing that comes upon us and
[2:20:41] that leaves but it's the breath of God
[2:20:44] that has filled us with eternal life and
[2:20:47] power
[2:20:48] hallelujah oma then this is it I just
[2:20:52] want you to understand for him
[2:20:54] when when he said when he said to Israel
[2:20:56] he said let my people go when he said
[2:21:01] that about Israel to Egypt and let my
[2:21:05] people go
[2:21:07] God has a relationship with you my
[2:21:10] people my sons Israel is my son my
[2:21:14] firstborn and if you don't let my son go
[2:21:17] I'll kill all your firstborn
[2:21:19] this is God's decree these are my
[2:21:22] children my sons they're born of my life
[2:21:25] they're part of my power the barn of my
[2:21:29] breath hallelujah now listen brother
[2:21:34] Branham would bring this down and in the
[2:21:36] blasphemous names he said the church is
[2:21:38] a mystical body of Christ born of the
[2:21:42] breath of God whom did you get it he
[2:21:45] says the Church of God is born of the
[2:21:48] breath of God God breathed breath into
[2:21:51] the nostril spirits live my Adam and he
[2:21:53] became a living soul did you know that
[2:21:56] true Pentecostal church is born of the
[2:21:59] breath of God hallelujah now so jesus
[2:22:04] said did the Spirit is like the wind in
[2:22:09] the wind is the breath of God we know
[2:22:12] this that when the breath of God enters
[2:22:15] us that were changed forever as our soul
[2:22:19] then becomes alive you see man can't see
[2:22:22] where it comes from and you don't know
[2:22:25] where it goes when it leaves but we know
[2:22:27] this when it leaves us little body
[2:22:29] we're gone with it a man Adam became
[2:22:33] god-breathed he became a living soul God
[2:22:38] breathed the eternal life into him which
[2:22:41] he would later forfeit for II remember
[2:22:44] but what they've turned down we come
[2:22:46] back and accept a man and Adam became
[2:22:50] God breathed and he became a living soul
[2:22:54] come on he breathed the breath of life
[2:22:57] into his nostril and he became an
[2:23:00] eternal so God breathe not what Nick's
[2:23:02] are done what God did he wasn't born of
[2:23:05] the natural birth didn't come from a
[2:23:07] woman and then get a breath but the
[2:23:10] Bible says of him God breathed the
[2:23:14] breath of life in the Adam and Adam
[2:23:18] became a living soul
[2:23:21] Alleluia now Adam would forfeit this a
[2:23:24] man he would father this for his wife
[2:23:27] Eve remember I tell you friends as we
[2:23:31] come down to it remember on the day of
[2:23:33] Pentecost God's got another church man
[2:23:38] she has been formed through his ministry
[2:23:41] and three and a half years of ministry
[2:23:43] walking on the earth and teaching and
[2:23:46] doctrine and they believed in Christ and
[2:23:48] they've accepted him as personal Savior
[2:23:50] and they know is either that he's the
[2:23:53] Christ the Son of the Living God and all
[2:23:55] of these things in the been through
[2:23:57] purging and Peter us with his person and
[2:23:59] they come down to repentance and there
[2:24:02] they've been baptized in his name is a
[2:24:04] matter with me but our brother God
[2:24:07] wasn't through with just a water baptism
[2:24:09] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[2:24:13] like a rushing mighty Wagner at God
[2:24:17] breathed upon his church and there was a
[2:24:21] church that rose to their feet that was
[2:24:26] of his life that was of this power they
[2:24:30] found that whoa that scene was him
[2:24:34] that he's a pisser now bone of my bone
[2:24:36] and this is my flesh of my flesh and she
[2:24:39] is life for my life but she is
[2:24:41] god-breathed hey man now every son that
[2:24:51] is born of the word of God or God
[2:24:53] breathed is when God breathed the breath
[2:24:56] of eternal life into them as brother
[2:24:59] Branham said in spoken words original
[2:25:02] seed all sudden all God's sons must be
[2:25:05] the same yes to be born of the word and
[2:25:08] the spirit brings us back to the spoken
[2:25:10] word again like in John 3 to be born in
[2:25:13] the water in the spirit what does it do
[2:25:15] it brings you back to the place where
[2:25:17] you should have been at the beginning
[2:25:19] and that was a reason of Christ's death
[2:25:22] to bring us back to where sons of God
[2:25:25] now let's look at this scripture for a
[2:25:28] moment let's go to 2nd Timothy 3:16 I'll
[2:25:31] wait till they get it on the on the
[2:25:33] screen just a moment let's just get some
[2:25:36] of these points together all Scripture
[2:25:41] is given by inspiration of God it is
[2:25:45] profitable for doctrine for reproof for
[2:25:47] correction for instruction and
[2:25:49] righteousness
[2:25:49] now that word there is translated all
[2:25:54] Scripture is given by inspiration of God
[2:25:57] but actually it comes from a greek word
[2:26:00] and it means this literally all
[2:26:03] Scripture is god-breathed and it is
[2:26:10] useful for teaching rebuking correcting
[2:26:12] and training in righteousness so all
[2:26:14] Scripture is god-breathed
[2:26:17] a man a man I actually ever word that I
[2:26:22] spoke has been breathed out and when God
[2:26:27] speaks a word it's his life breathing
[2:26:30] out his word are you with me now then
[2:26:35] this is the only use of in the Bible of
[2:26:37] this Greek word theophan T of notice
[2:26:41] which means God breathed inspired by God
[2:26:45] due to the inspiration of God so the
[2:26:47] word
[2:26:48] of God is formed by God's own breath
[2:26:52] stop for a minute that's why this
[2:26:55] message didn't come from a denomination
[2:26:59] this message didn't come from a school
[2:27:02] of theology this message was came from
[2:27:05] God's own breath God breathed a message
[2:27:10] in this last day to an endtime people he
[2:27:13] would prove that he was here then he was
[2:27:16] present that he knew the harlot that he
[2:27:18] knew the thoughts that he knew your
[2:27:20] address to show you that he was present
[2:27:23] because God was breathing a message oh
[2:27:27] man I want you to understand this is
[2:27:30] what the message of God is the word of
[2:27:33] God is formed by God's own breath and
[2:27:35] when a man speaks under the inspiration
[2:27:38] of the Holy Ghost
[2:27:40] you know God speaks to man it's the life
[2:27:43] of God the Holy Ghost for man his words
[2:27:47] as a man will speak as Oracle for
[2:27:51] the Bible said if any man speaks let him
[2:27:54] speak as the Oracles of God Amen or
[2:27:59] hallelujah
[2:27:59] that means it's the logos coming out a
[2:28:03] man jesus said the words that I speak
[2:28:07] they are spirit and they are life we got
[2:28:12] a lot of words that are out there that
[2:28:14] are just dead trees but when Jesus
[2:28:17] speaks them they are spirit and they are
[2:28:19] life oh man now that you see the power
[2:28:23] of God's breath in the in divine
[2:28:26] inspiration is shown throughout the
[2:28:28] Bible God breathed the breath of life
[2:28:30] into Adam amen Jesus breathed upon his
[2:28:34] disciples and said receiving the Holy
[2:28:36] Ghost and my Peter said where that the
[2:28:40] prophecy never had its origin in the
[2:28:42] will of man but men spoke from God as
[2:28:46] they were moved by the spirit it was God
[2:28:49] breathing through the through those men
[2:28:53] of God and rent speaking his word so
[2:28:56] these are the types of the scripture but
[2:28:58] every son
[2:29:00] God is born of the word of God so
[2:29:03] therefore they too are God breathed a
[2:29:07] man and it's when God breathed eternal
[2:29:11] the breath of eternal life until now I
[2:29:14] want you to go back to Revelation 19 and
[2:29:16] 9 and let's look carefully at the
[2:29:18] scripture that defines the bride blessed
[2:29:21] are they that are called into the
[2:29:22] marriage supper of the lamb and he said
[2:29:25] unto me these are the true sayings of
[2:29:30] God now let's just go back to what it
[2:29:36] says these are the true words of God
[2:29:40] these are the true logos of God and
[2:29:46] remember the logos comes out from his
[2:29:49] breath he breathes his word are you with
[2:29:53] me he breathed his breath and more sons
[2:29:56] are born a man he breathed in the Adam
[2:30:00] and he received eternal life he breathed
[2:30:03] into the church and even the Turks
[2:30:05] receive the eternal life he breathes
[2:30:08] into you and you received the Holy Ghost
[2:30:10] eternal life is that right amen but I
[2:30:14] want you to notice these that are going
[2:30:16] to the marriage supper
[2:30:17] they are the true sayings of God none
[2:30:21] are you you didn't get what I said these
[2:30:24] that go in the marriage supper they are
[2:30:27] the true sayings of God they are the
[2:30:30] true Word of God amen because they are
[2:30:35] God breed they are God's own word we're
[2:30:39] not you're saying Junction's not saying
[2:30:41] what I've said is true and it's the true
[2:30:43] Word of God he said deeds that go to the
[2:30:45] marriage supper
[2:30:47] they are the true letters of God
[2:30:50] [Applause]
[2:30:53] [Music]
[2:30:57] [Applause]
[2:31:01] we can believe in miracles hallelujah
[2:31:06] because the locust we are that we can
[2:31:17] live right because the world is a power
[2:31:20] in us there's somebody with me now
[2:31:22] because these that go in the marriage
[2:31:25] supper
[2:31:26] they are the true words there are other
[2:31:28] words but this is a true word there are
[2:31:31] other gospel but this is a true gospel
[2:31:33] you generation hallelujah you are the
[2:31:44] logos those that are called or the true
[2:31:47] logos they are the thoughts of God
[2:31:50] breathe a word is the thoughts of God
[2:31:54] breathe if it isn't breath it never
[2:31:57] comes word but when God breathes it out
[2:32:00] of his thoughts and it comes from
[2:32:02] thoughts and conveyed by the wind of his
[2:32:05] spirit
[2:32:05] it becomes word and when you came from
[2:32:08] hallelujah where you were once only in
[2:32:11] the thoughts of the flower the lonely
[2:32:14] God are you in there now but all now you
[2:32:16] are now made manifest and become God
[2:32:19] breathe that what God has in his thought
[2:32:22] have been propelled by a spirit to the
[2:32:25] stage of time to be the work
[2:32:27] demonstrated for your age and your time
[2:32:31] [Music]
[2:32:31] [Applause]
[2:32:33] Jesus was at rubra Word of God
[2:32:36] and the bride will be the true Word of
[2:32:38] God Jesus was the true lamb in
[2:32:42] comparison to the woolly lamb somebody
[2:32:47] help me preach now a man he was the true
[2:32:51] lamb now that lamb was true but this is
[2:32:54] the true lamb
[2:32:55] in comparison to the woolly lamb the
[2:32:58] woolly lamb was only temporary it only
[2:33:01] worked for a time but Jesus was the true
[2:33:03] lamb this was a lamb but this was a true
[2:33:06] lamb it's somebody with me now and this
[2:33:10] is these are the true sayings of God
[2:33:13] this is where we come back to where the
[2:33:16] scene was that this is a to grind just
[2:33:19] like the original grain this is not the
[2:33:22] in-between where the light passes
[2:33:24] through the stuff but what was in the
[2:33:26] beginning is mallet again what was it
[2:33:29] aware that pinnacle is not the word at
[2:33:32] the end time okay are the true sayings
[2:33:35] of God hallelujah hallelujah a man the
[2:33:47] others that never come to a full birth
[2:33:50] that go as far as confession our
[2:33:53] conception of belief of Christ but are
[2:33:57] never born of his breath no this is
[2:34:07] what's going to happen with the church
[2:34:09] because in the church there's been too
[2:34:11] many rotten eggs because the church
[2:34:14] hadn't been with the real mate they
[2:34:17] never received the junk of life are you
[2:34:21] with me and this has been the problem is
[2:34:24] that the babies has come to the birth
[2:34:27] but the church hasn't had the strength
[2:34:30] to bring forth so in Luther's time you
[2:34:35] know it was time it was it was time that
[2:34:38] should have been a birth but they didn't
[2:34:40] have strength to bring it so they
[2:34:42] brought it just as far as justification
[2:34:44] who s slow it brings us a virus
[2:34:46] sanctification and Pentecost would bring
[2:34:49] us as far as the restoration of the
[2:34:51] gifts but in this day there's strength
[2:34:56] to bring forth birth there's a church
[2:34:59] that has being born of the word and
[2:35:01] these are the true sayings of God
[2:35:07] that's who you are and not only that but
[2:35:16] when he did since you're the word he
[2:35:21] granted that you be arrayed in the
[2:35:27] righteousness of the saints remember you
[2:35:37] know a lot of customs in the wedding
[2:35:38] time is something borrowed something
[2:35:40] blue something whatever I don't remember
[2:35:43] all the slowly saying somebody someone
[2:35:45] wants something that one of these girls
[2:35:46] are no but anyway do you know let me
[2:35:50] just tell you for this minute the Bible
[2:35:53] said he granted that you be arrayed in
[2:35:57] the righteousness of the saints did you
[2:36:03] notice he didn't say my righteousness he
[2:36:08] said the righteousness of the saints of
[2:36:10] course it's his righteousness but do you
[2:36:14] realize the righteousness that was in
[2:36:17] Abraham come on let's come back for a
[2:36:22] minute Abraham I mean excuse me Jesus he
[2:36:26] was not the woolly lamb he was the true
[2:36:28] lamb we're not Abraham

[2:36:35] prophesied of us we are the word he was
[2:36:39] prophesied about he was prophesied are
[2:36:42] you with me now he was prophesied that
[2:36:45] he would go from them from faith into
[2:36:48] grace into the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:36:51] in the meat melih him to the chains of
[2:36:53] the body he prophesied your whole life
[2:36:55] and it's late right out in Abraham's
[2:36:58] life but I want you to know you are not
