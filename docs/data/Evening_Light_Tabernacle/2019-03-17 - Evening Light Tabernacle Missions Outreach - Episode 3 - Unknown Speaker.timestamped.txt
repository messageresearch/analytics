[0:00] located in North Louisiana evening light
[0:03] Tabernacle has always helped forth the
[0:06] scripture that Jesus Christ is the same
[0:08] yesterday today and forever today we
[0:13] invite you to delve into the scripture
[0:14] with us as the ministry discusses God's
[0:17] truth in our day hello everyone we are
[0:26] back again the ministry team at evening
[0:29] light tabernacle Minden Louisiana we are
[0:32] Bible believing Church that proclaiming
[0:35] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[0:37] and forever proclaiming to God to the
[0:41] world and living God and happy that
[0:44] you've joined us today for this
[0:45] discussion we ended the the last
[0:50] discussion on that Jesus is seeking for
[0:54] worshipers who worship humans sincerity
[0:58] and truth and how that Jesus proclaimed
[1:01] if you hold to my teaching you are
[1:04] really my disciples and then you will
[1:07] know the truth and the truth shall set
[1:09] you free so today we're going to search
[1:12] for our answers in the Bible and Jesus
[1:16] referred to the Bible with complete
[1:18] confidence to his accuracy and his
[1:20] authority so he said for us to search
[1:23] the Scriptures for in them you think you
[1:26] have eternal life they are they to
[1:27] testify of me
[1:32] so all scripture then is is given to us
[1:36] of God do you think the Apostles
[1:41] considered the words that they were
[1:43] speaking with Scripture such as the
[1:45] Apostle Paul is noted that Peter
[1:49] referred to Paul's writings as as
[1:52] scriptures and they do pervert Paul's
[1:56] writings as they do the other scriptures
[1:58] and so they knew that Paul was
[2:01] vindicated and Paul even said that the
[2:04] revelation that he received was not of
[2:06] man but it came from God and he said if
[2:09] an angel preach anything else than what
[2:12] he had already
[2:13] let him be accursed oh so then we then
[2:17] have to go back to Paul's gospel or
[2:19] we're cursed it's exactly correct strong
[2:23] language but didn't call to use that
[2:26] kind of language they said if an an
[2:28] angel came from heaven preaching any
[2:30] other guys or he said I can't change
[2:33] what I said so the Word of God is
[2:36] unchangeable a manner and so we cannot
[2:39] compromise on it if it was true then
[2:41] it's too nice for the histories even say
[2:44] that when Paul after he'd came out from
[2:48] his tutelage or whatnot when he came to
[2:51] Peter that the two of them saw
[2:52] eye-to-eye on doctor you know they were
[2:55] seeing the very same thing so it shows
[2:57] that God doesn't change he's not a god
[2:59] this way to one man under God this way
[3:01] to another they were absolutely in
[3:03] agreement on their doctrine and we know
[3:05] that God used Paul to actually write
[3:07] down almost the entire New Testament to
[3:10] found his church that's where we go back
[3:12] to it if anybody comes and preach
[3:14] another gospel than what I preached let
[3:16] him be accursed
[3:17] because you know Paul was vindicated by
[3:20] God yes to be the instrument by which he
[3:23] used to found the church I think his
[3:26] tutelage that you speak of was a
[3:28] backside of the desert or that you know
[3:32] that in Arabia for three years that he's
[3:34] sat comparing the scripture and and
[3:38] searching descriptors and I think as
[3:40] believers today we have a responsibility
[3:43] to search the Scriptures to see whether
[3:48] or not we are really teaching the
[3:50] teachings of Jesus amen
[3:52] it's important for each and every person
[3:55] in the church to do the same thing not
[3:56] just to swallow down what's coming over
[3:58] the pulpits because a lot of times what
[4:00] we find is there there's a man-made
[4:02] Jesus being preached many times and it's
[4:05] an it's a new Jesus is not the the
[4:07] scripture or is not the Jesus of the
[4:09] scripture you know because you find
[4:11] things that are preached that don't line
[4:12] up with what Paul taught you find things
[4:15] that are freaks that don't line up with
[4:17] the scripture so even though they're
[4:19] claiming is Jesus it's not the Jesus of
[4:21] the Bible but if the people would dig in
[4:24] the scripture
[4:24] and study and search and pray they
[4:27] wouldn't be so easily deceived or led
[4:29] astray because it's right there clearly
[4:30] for them for each Christian in red
[4:32] lettering Jesus said search the
[4:34] Scriptures for in them you think you
[4:36] have eternal life and they were they
[4:37] that testify of me and when Paul wrote
[4:40] the New Testament he referred to the Old
[4:42] Testament over three hundred times and
[4:44] so he was a word prophet it was
[4:47] established in continuity with the Old
[4:49] Testament giving birth to the New
[4:51] Testament and him again speaking in
[4:53] Hebrews 13:8 he said Jesus Christ the
[4:56] same and I believe that's a powerful
[4:59] word you know it's the same so anytime
[5:01] Jesus has changed he don't change right
[5:04] so he's only changed by man you can own
[5:07] you know and then it goes what brother
[5:08] Aaron is saying it becomes a Jesus of
[5:10] their own making their own believe that
[5:12] fits that fits what they want to believe
[5:15] instead of them changing to fit him him
[5:18] so when it says the same what follows
[5:20] that yesterday yesterday today and
[5:22] forever so is today covered in that
[5:25] statement absolutely so it has to be the
[5:27] same forever as it was the day that
[5:29] scripture was written that's right well
[5:31] you know it's striking to me if not a
[5:36] million books that are written on one
[5:39] book interpreting the Bible and so you
[5:42] know bookstores are full of men's ideas
[5:48] and this man's ideas and that one in
[5:50] commentaries and this and that all the
[5:53] Holy Scriptures and you know again I
[5:56] think that it's important that we come
[5:58] back to the foundation of the church for
[6:03] the church the Bible said is built upon
[6:06] the foundation of apostles and prophets
[6:08] with Jesus Christ Himself being the
[6:12] chief Cornerstone so it all begins with
[6:15] Jesus yeah and it's built there upon him
[6:18] in any revelation that is not
[6:22] proclaiming Jesus Christ the same in
[6:25] every detail except for his corporal
[6:27] body is of course see the discrepancy
[6:30] that's right it's possible so that's why
[6:32] with it being built off Jesus Satan
[6:34] tries that he's the cornerstone that's
[6:37] why he wants to change where it starts
[6:39] because if he changed where it starts
[6:41] once it gets down here is a way off
[6:43] that's right exactly but you know when
[6:47] God created the world's the Bible said
[6:49] that he did it by faith in God framed
[6:53] the worlds together and all of the
[6:55] galaxies the Sun the Moon the Stars
[6:58] everything the world hangs in its orbit
[7:02] and and the foundations of God was made
[7:05] by his word we don't have to worry about
[7:09] the Sun rising or setting we don't have
[7:11] to worry about the whole winner it
[7:13] continues the same the earth continues
[7:15] the same and if the foundations of
[7:18] creation is sure then surely the
[7:22] foundation of Christianity must remain
[7:25] sure yeah and the Bible says that Isaiah
[7:27] 28 verse 16 therefore thus saith the
[7:30] Lord God behold I lay in Zion a
[7:32] foundation stone a tried stone a
[7:35] precious cornerstone a sure foundation
[7:38] amen he that believeth shall not make
[7:40] haste or not be ashamed he said in
[7:42] Romans Amen
[7:44] I'm so glad we won't be left to shake
[7:47] but actually there there's a God that
[7:50] backs up his word raising oh man no this
[7:53] is where he said you know in Matthew 16
[7:57] when he came to Caesarea Philippi he
[8:01] asked his disciples whom do men say that
[8:04] I the Son of Man no that's a pretty good
[8:07] question even today because you know
[8:09] someone would say you know wow you're
[8:12] John the Baptist or ones in your
[8:14] Alliance or Jeremiah and then so today
[8:17] we have 41,000 difference one saying of
[8:22] who Jesus is he didn't say that
[8:25] yes that's right and so but he's got to
[8:27] come back to that personal question who
[8:31] do you say that the son of man have and
[8:34] that's where that every person must have
[8:37] for his foundation stone
[8:40] personal revelation of Jesus Christ is
[8:43] that true where he met Christ himself
[8:47] you know you go back as we go back to
[8:50] Peter and Paul and you look at the two
[8:51] of them you have one a scholar you have
[8:54] another an ignorant you had one who
[8:57] persecuted the church you had another
[8:59] who denied Christ but you have one have
[9:02] another room experiences you have
[9:03] another stricken down on the road to
[9:05] Damascus they both had a personal
[9:07] revelation of who Jesus Christ was and
[9:10] after that personal revelation their
[9:13] doctors were the same and their faith
[9:14] was the same a and yet they were
[9:16] undeniable the undeniably be able to
[9:21] just found the church and push the
[9:23] gospel and be used of God
[9:25] Peter was for the Jews Paul for the
[9:28] Gentiles and you see the movement God
[9:30] used him and yet want from two different
[9:33] extremes so it's a piggyback off of that
[9:36] you can't have somebody that has a
[9:38] personal revelation of Jesus Christ and
[9:40] another person have a personal
[9:42] revelation of Jesus Christ and come
[9:44] together and they're doctors not lying
[9:45] up and one have this you know this
[9:47] doctor and one have this doctrine if
[9:49] they both met the same crime exactly
[9:51] they'll have the same revelation of who
[9:53] he is exactly well there's got to be one
[9:55] truth then yes yeah
[9:57] so you know that's one absolute and not
[10:00] still the Word of God and we should as
[10:03] the disciples are those that came from
[10:06] the upper room they were all saying the
[10:07] same thing and believing that the same
[10:09] thing having everything in common with
[10:11] John tells us in the beginning was the
[10:13] word the Word was God and the Word was
[10:15] with God then we find later down that
[10:18] the Word was made flesh yeah where is it
[10:20] made flesh in Jesus Christ so he said he
[10:25] would build a church now this is what he
[10:27] said I will build a church and I'm gonna
[10:31] build it on a rock so what is that rock
[10:36] some people think that rocks Peter the
[10:38] Catholic Church says his Peter a man who
[10:41] denied Christ three times well and the
[10:44] erstwhile doing it yeah his church built
[10:46] on on fickle man who can change with
[10:49] their moods or or be upset or be higher
[10:52] or below I don't believe that he would
[10:55] do that
[10:56] that's because they teach you know the
[10:59] succession of the apostolic succession
[11:02] passing down from Peter to the next Pope
[11:05] to the next and of course then you have
[11:07] ever poked changing what the others said
[11:09] and now you got the Word of God that can
[11:12] be changed by fickle men just whatever
[11:14] we decide and according to the times and
[11:17] I would say that the word no matter
[11:20] whether it's 2019 or what it is that the
[11:24] word is still the same exact and it
[11:27] cannot be changed it is an absolute any
[11:32] absolute is a standard that that has
[11:35] been set that the our faith must be
[11:38] built upon the solid rock of the Word of
[11:40] God Peter gave the right response in
[11:44] Matthew 16:16 you know Jesus asking who
[11:47] do you say that I am in his responses
[11:49] thou art the Christ the Son of the
[11:52] Living God and we find that jesus
[11:54] replied to him is because of this
[11:56] revelation I will build my church so
[11:59] really then the ever believer his his
[12:04] revelation or the rock that he's built
[12:07] upon his a revelation personally to him
[12:10] of who Jesus is Jesus Christ made known
[12:13] to him personally straight back and so
[12:15] there again that must be the rock the
[12:18] church is built upon is the rock of
[12:22] Revelation of who Christ is exactly so
[12:25] if we can find out who Jesus is and what
[12:28] he did and then the church that he's set
[12:31] forth and be that church then that would
[12:35] be the would surely that he's coming
[12:37] back without spot or wrinkle there's
[12:40] only one church going in the rapture
[12:42] there's only one church that he's coming
[12:45] back for there's only one church spoke
[12:48] in the bible teacher and in order to be
[12:51] saved we've got to be a part of that
[12:53] church amen yeah I mean that's he said I
[12:56] will build my church
[12:58] not churches amen you know it's not
[13:02] 41,000 churches he's built he's built a
[13:04] church right no revelation are we
[13:08] talking about a church building a
[13:11] certain group of people a certain
[13:13] denomination or we looking at a
[13:16] worldwide body that has come together
[13:18] with the same revelation of who Jesus is
[13:22] that's what it is he's got a body around
[13:25] the world as he said people out of every
[13:28] kindred tongue tribe and nation so um
[13:32] but one thing that really strikes me
[13:35] about that whole conversation with Peter
[13:38] in Jesus he said on this rock I'll build
[13:40] my church and the gates of hell you know
[13:47] this is a powerful channel a weak
[13:51] powerless church that is run over and
[13:54] blowed by every wind of doctrine but a
[13:57] powerful church who has the signs of
[14:00] wonders the miraculous power and the
[14:04] life changing by a man because what is
[14:07] what is the healing of the body if
[14:09] there's not really a true healing of the
[14:12] salt that's right it's only temporary
[14:15] soul has changed its changed forever
[14:17] that's right so you know for the
[14:20] individual Christ in you makes you the
[14:24] center of the revelation amen
[14:26] so Christ and you makes him the center
[14:30] of the life of the revelation in Christ
[14:33] and the Bible makes the Bible the
[14:35] complete revelation of the whole thing
[14:36] wonderful so you know this is something
[14:39] that is very important for us to know
[14:42] that the new birth is a revelation of
[14:44] Jesus Christ personally to you yes and
[14:47] so what is it then is it you join the
[14:50] church
[14:51] shake hands with a preacher decided to
[14:56] live by code of rules are recited decree
[15:00] so what
[15:02] is that new part it's a life that Christ
[15:06] live is now living in you Nathan that's
[15:09] right that's exactly right because as we
[15:12] saw there on the day of Pentecost you
[15:14] know it came in like a rushing mighty
[15:15] wind and tongues of fire was spread
[15:18] across the the people you know and their
[15:21] lives was changed and they begin to do
[15:24] the very works that Jesus did 14:12 your
[15:27] the works that I do shall you do also so
[15:30] now what you had there I say instead of
[15:32] instead of one person Jesus walking
[15:35] around with the power of God
[15:37] you know deliverance setting free you
[15:39] had 120 now just like that because they
[15:43] came not only did they come into his
[15:44] presence his presence came into what's
[15:48] he to me it comes right back to the
[15:50] words of Jesus when he said in his
[15:52] prayer he said I thank thee O Father
[15:54] Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou
[15:57] has here that these things from the wise
[15:59] and the prudent and has revealed them
[16:02] unto babes notice who is revealed to
[16:04] babes those who are born again you must
[16:08] be born again
[16:09] and so God has himself from the from the
[16:13] schools of learning from the experts of
[16:15] theology but reveals himself to those
[16:19] that are born again this is where he
[16:20] said to Nicodemus you know you must be
[16:24] born again to be able to understand the
[16:26] kingdom of God so it's a personal
[16:28] individual affair with the person that
[16:32] Christ is revealed to them so in that
[16:34] first church brother Tim the Bible said
[16:37] they were one mind one Accord they spake
[16:40] the same thing because the church and
[16:43] the body when I read the scripture
[16:45] seemed to be the self same thing that
[16:48] the body of Christ is the Church of the
[16:50] Living God and that Christ is the head
[16:52] of his own church that means that it's
[16:55] not organized or led by man moved by men
[16:58] controlled by men but it was controlled
[17:00] by God and him alone Astrea men being
[17:03] led of the Holy Spirit and only the
[17:06] revelation of Christ could make them one
[17:08] and one Accord and speak the same you
[17:11] can't legislate that I think a lot of
[17:13] the misconception today though with
[17:15] people in church joining is it's a
[17:18] church I belong to an assembler a body
[17:21] and they get away from that the truly
[17:23] being the church is an individual that
[17:25] we just talked about it's a personal
[17:27] revelation it's an individual he's
[17:29] coming for an individual it's not a what
[17:32] my church believes it's what I believe
[17:33] is my revelation of who Jesus Christ is
[17:36] so he's not coming for building he's not
[17:38] coming for a group of people that are in
[17:41] a certain building but he is coming for
[17:45] individuals who have truly given their
[17:49] life to Christ and so he says as he said
[17:53] this is the glory of this mystery among
[17:55] the gentiles which is christ in you the
[17:59] hope of glory Israel so that's what
[18:01] we're going to be speaking about even as
[18:04] we come back to our next session we're
[18:06] going to be talking about how that God
[18:09] refers to this church singular
[18:11] it is not churches he has one church
[18:14] there's one Lord one faith one baptism
[18:16] one God and Father of assaults and then
[18:20] you know his word is true from the
[18:22] beginning amen and so we want to go back
[18:25] to the beginning thank you for joining
[18:28] with the ministry team at evening light
