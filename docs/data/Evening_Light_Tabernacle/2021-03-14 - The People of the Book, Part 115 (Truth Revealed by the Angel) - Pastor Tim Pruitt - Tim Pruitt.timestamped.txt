[1:02:21] amen exodus chapter 3
[1:02:25] and verse 1 is where we'll read from
[1:02:27] this morning
[1:02:29] exodus chapter 3 and verse 1.
[1:02:34] now moses kept the flock of jethro his
[1:02:36] father-in-law the priesthood midian
[1:02:39] and he led the flop to the backside of
[1:02:41] the desert and came to the mountain of
[1:02:43] god even to horeb
[1:02:45] now this horror would be the same as
[1:02:49] mount sinai
[1:02:50] it would be where the law would be given
[1:02:53] it would be where
[1:02:55] god would say i'll bring you back to
[1:02:57] this mountain
[1:02:58] and no matter what what happened he knew
[1:03:01] that he would bring the children of
[1:03:02] israel
[1:03:03] back to this place this would be a place
[1:03:06] where
[1:03:07] they would be covenant with god and
[1:03:11] as the jews say this where that god
[1:03:14] married
[1:03:15] israel and united with the old testament
[1:03:19] bride by giving them his word
[1:03:23] now this is really uh important to
[1:03:25] understand because we are
[1:03:27] also in another exodus we are also in
[1:03:30] another pentecost
[1:03:32] remember this would take place where
[1:03:34] we're where they would come back to this
[1:03:36] mountain
[1:03:37] 50 weeks after the passover
[1:03:41] 50 days after the passover which would
[1:03:44] be seven weeks
[1:03:46] and seven weeks later they would reach
[1:03:49] this place again where that moses met
[1:03:52] the pillar of fire
[1:03:54] and we have come now through seven
[1:03:56] church ages
[1:03:57] from the passover from calvary where
[1:04:00] jesus gave
[1:04:01] his life at the cross and the token was
[1:04:04] given
[1:04:05] all the way now to and we have the
[1:04:06] churches journeyed now
[1:04:08] for seven different church ages and now
[1:04:11] we come
[1:04:12] to the fulfillment of all the types of
[1:04:15] the scripture
[1:04:17] and so when the scripture says when the
[1:04:19] day of pentecost was fully come
[1:04:21] it was speaking about from from the time
[1:04:24] where calvary where jesus died to seven
[1:04:27] weeks
[1:04:27] later which these were the the the
[1:04:31] this the seven weeks of of um
[1:04:34] of unleavened bread and and feast days
[1:04:38] and then it would come now to the day of
[1:04:41] pentecost
[1:04:42] so it would be fully come the the weeks
[1:04:45] fulfilled
[1:04:46] and remember they were all typing now we
[1:04:49] have come from that
[1:04:50] passover for seven church ages
[1:04:54] and so this is a day where that the day
[1:04:56] of pentecost has
[1:04:58] fully come and this is the day where he
[1:05:02] pours out his spirit in the great
[1:05:05] finality
[1:05:07] of all that he's done of all the works
[1:05:10] that he's done from
[1:05:11] all the way from genesis and the
[1:05:13] creation
[1:05:14] right now up to this time and it all
[1:05:17] comes in it heads up right here in this
[1:05:21] day
[1:05:22] and this hour for fulfillment
[1:05:25] i say this is a wonderful day to be
[1:05:28] living in
[1:05:29] it's the greatest hour of all mankind to
[1:05:32] be standing right on the
[1:05:34] cusp the break the edge of the rapture
[1:05:38] itself
[1:05:40] amen where god consummates the whole
[1:05:43] thing
[1:05:44] and takes the people to a new home
[1:05:50] amen are you ready for your new home
[1:05:53] i'm ready for my new home amen i'm ready
[1:05:57] for a new body
[1:05:58] that's right amen and i don't care if
[1:06:00] you're 18 years old
[1:06:02] you you should be ready for a new body
[1:06:05] amen because this one
[1:06:07] is one where there is trouble in sin and
[1:06:10] sickness and disease amen but that one
[1:06:14] is a glorified body amen
[1:06:18] and whether to never any of that inner
[1:06:21] now verse 2 says and the angel of the
[1:06:25] lord appeared to him in a flame
[1:06:27] of fire out of the midst of the bush and
[1:06:31] he looked and behold the bush burned
[1:06:32] with fire
[1:06:34] and the bush was not consumed so here we
[1:06:37] see a light
[1:06:38] it is mailing it is it is it's flaming
[1:06:42] like a fire it looks
[1:06:43] like a fire it's a light and it has the
[1:06:46] appearance of a
[1:06:48] of an amber a yellowish green
[1:06:52] color and it's it's pulsating in this
[1:06:54] bush
[1:06:55] and and he sees it's not a natural fire
[1:06:58] because it's not consuming the bush
[1:07:01] and moses said i will now turn aside and
[1:07:04] see this great sight
[1:07:06] and why the bush is not burnt and when
[1:07:09] the lord
[1:07:10] saw he turned aside god
[1:07:14] called unto him out of the midst of the
[1:07:16] bush
[1:07:17] notice if you go back to verse two go
[1:07:20] back to verse two and the angel lord
[1:07:22] appeared to him in a flame of fire
[1:07:24] then you come into here in verse four
[1:07:27] and god called
[1:07:28] him out of the midst of the bush so it
[1:07:31] was the
[1:07:31] angel of god yet it was god himself
[1:07:35] because it was the angel or the
[1:07:38] messenger of his
[1:07:39] covenant it was god in theophanic
[1:07:43] form and he would veil himself now in a
[1:07:45] pillar of fire
[1:07:47] now look at this and and he says
[1:07:50] and and then he called and said moses
[1:07:53] moses he said here am i
[1:07:55] and he said in verse 5 and he said draw
[1:07:57] not and i hit her put off thy shoes from
[1:07:59] off that feet
[1:08:00] for the place where on thy stand at this
[1:08:02] holy ground
[1:08:03] moreover he said i am the god of thy
[1:08:07] father
[1:08:08] the god of abraham the god of isaac and
[1:08:10] the god of jacob
[1:08:12] and moses hid his face for he was afraid
[1:08:15] to look upon
[1:08:16] god then i would like you to turn with
[1:08:19] me to exodus chapter 23
[1:08:22] and we will read from verse 20 exodus 23
[1:08:25] and verse 20. behold i send an angel
[1:08:29] before thee
[1:08:30] to keep thee in the way and to bring
[1:08:33] thee into the place
[1:08:34] which i have prepared beware of him and
[1:08:38] obey his voice
[1:08:39] and provoke him not for he will not
[1:08:41] pardon your transgressions
[1:08:44] for my name is in him if thou
[1:08:47] will indeed obey his voice and do all
[1:08:50] that i speak then i will be an enemy
[1:08:52] unto thine enemies
[1:08:54] and an adversary into thine adversary
[1:08:56] for mine angels shall go before thee
[1:08:59] and bring thee in unto the amorites the
[1:09:02] hittites of perizzites the canaanites
[1:09:05] the highlights and the jebusites
[1:09:07] and i will cut them off amen
[1:09:11] as well as any website that's against
[1:09:13] this message
[1:09:17] amen god bless you can be seated
[1:09:21] we're going to be speak on speaking
[1:09:23] today on
[1:09:25] truth revealed by the angel
[1:09:29] truth as revealed by the angel
[1:09:33] now as i went over last sunday and
[1:09:37] and you know i hope you don't mind me
[1:09:40] just kind of um
[1:09:41] taking a little bit of time here just to
[1:09:44] kind of bring us back
[1:09:46] into our thoughts we've had wonderful
[1:09:48] meetings and
[1:09:49] great times we had brother joe adams
[1:09:51] minister and wednesday night that bless
[1:09:54] us so much and
[1:09:55] you know many other things that as the
[1:09:57] week has went by and things that you've
[1:09:59] listened to
[1:10:00] or heard or read or
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:10:04] communicated with others or whatever but
[1:10:07] i wanted to kind of bring our thoughts
[1:10:08] back
[1:10:09] now to the word today is i'm going to
[1:10:12] do a little bit of mixing maybe a preach
[1:10:15] teach
[1:10:16] today and and um kind of bring in some
[1:10:19] things to
[1:10:21] because i i think it's really important
[1:10:24] that you
[1:10:24] know who it is that is among us
[1:10:28] and i'm identifying the angel
[1:10:31] of his presence that was here in our
[1:10:34] generation and this
[1:10:35] continues to be here even unto this day
[1:10:38] because he is the i am god that was
[1:10:42] which is and shall come the almighty
[1:10:46] now what sets us apart as i've told you
[1:10:49] uh it sets us apart from
[1:10:52] this the rest of the denominations in
[1:10:55] the christian world today is that
[1:10:57] this message is not heralded from a
[1:11:00] denominational headquarters
[1:11:02] but it is a message that descended from
[1:11:05] the heavenly dimensions beyond
[1:11:08] as an angel stepped out of the light
[1:11:11] much like he did in the um first exodus
[1:11:15] this light was a whirling fire it mealed
[1:11:18] around
[1:11:19] churning within um within and
[1:11:23] hanging first in the air and pulsating
[1:11:25] with an
[1:11:26] energy growing bigger and brighter as it
[1:11:29] as it grew there the light spread in the
[1:11:32] window
[1:11:33] or not from the window but in in the
[1:11:35] place
[1:11:36] where brother branham was and spread out
[1:11:38] on the floor getting larger and larger
[1:11:40] spreading out across the floor
[1:11:44] now you know it would be sometimes later
[1:11:46] i think
[1:11:47] it was when with brother branham and
[1:11:50] seemed like the place was in vidalia um
[1:11:54] illinois where brother billy paul was
[1:11:57] awakened one night
[1:11:58] with brother branham and and he had
[1:12:01] asked him if he could see
[1:12:03] the angel of the lord said it would help
[1:12:05] billy to understand he
[1:12:07] helps me in the ministry can i wake him
[1:12:09] and he gave permission to it
[1:12:12] and he saw him standing there a man
[1:12:14] about six foot tall and
[1:12:16] uh olive complexion and he had dark hair
[1:12:20] about to the shoulder and and then
[1:12:23] he had um as he was there he
[1:12:26] he was he saw the the light
[1:12:30] around him and he said he was really
[1:12:32] scared and
[1:12:33] and and uh frightened by this light and
[1:12:36] said oh daddy don't let him get me and
[1:12:38] he said
[1:12:38] oh he'll not hurt you son he said this
[1:12:41] is the angel of god that talks to me
[1:12:44] and he said in a few moments the light
[1:12:46] gathered around him
[1:12:48] and around his feet and he stepped right
[1:12:50] into that
[1:12:51] and he said he changed back to that
[1:12:53] light and he went
[1:12:54] right out the window
[1:12:57] now this would come of course
[1:13:01] in almost every service that brother
[1:13:03] branham would preach
[1:13:05] if he would mention seeing the angel of
[1:13:08] the lord
[1:13:09] and let me just say if he didn't see him
[1:13:11] he was present
[1:13:13] and so in this occasion when he first
[1:13:16] came
[1:13:16] he would see this light come in a place
[1:13:20] where he was praying and he heard
[1:13:21] footsteps and
[1:13:23] and squinting at the light you see a
[1:13:24] barefoot um
[1:13:26] and then a white robe and then out of
[1:13:28] that you know would
[1:13:29] light would walk a man well it was like
[1:13:32] a man
[1:13:33] yet it was a supernatural being that
[1:13:35] walked out of a light
[1:13:37] that had entered the room and as it
[1:13:40] described
[1:13:41] you know a six foot tall about 200
[1:13:44] pounds massive arms which
[1:13:46] fo were were folded in front of him and
[1:13:50] his dark hairs fell around his shoulders
[1:13:52] and
[1:13:53] he appeared to be about the age of 30
[1:13:56] beardless face
[1:13:57] um and um a dark olive complexion his
[1:14:01] eyes were dark and piercing and
[1:14:03] and it was this angelic visitation from
[1:14:06] god that revealed
[1:14:07] the word now i want you to understand
[1:14:10] this is what has happened
[1:14:11] all down through the bible this is the
[1:14:15] bible way
[1:14:16] of the word being revealed to the
[1:14:19] prophets and apostles
[1:14:21] and that's what gave us the bible
[1:14:24] and then genesis 22 tells of the story
[1:14:27] of
[1:14:28] isaac being offered as a sacrifice and
[1:14:31] it was there the angel lord appears to
[1:14:33] abraham and
[1:14:34] refers to himself as god in the first
[1:14:37] person
[1:14:38] it would be exodus 3 that we read from
[1:14:41] where the angel lord was in this burning
[1:14:43] bush
[1:14:44] and identifies himself as the i am that
[1:14:47] i
[1:14:47] am it would be in exodus 14 and 19
[1:14:51] that the angel of god led the children
[1:14:54] of israel and then
[1:14:55] would also follow behind them with the
[1:14:58] pillar of fire
[1:15:00] and this pillar of fire was a theophanic
[1:15:03] present
[1:15:04] that led the children of israel to their
[1:15:06] promised land
[1:15:08] and this too is a prophecy as we've
[1:15:10] already spoke about
[1:15:11] of the bride of christ who's led by a
[1:15:14] pillar of fire
[1:15:16] all the way to the rapture i want you to
[1:15:19] get it to you he has
[1:15:20] not left us and man he didn't go away
[1:15:23] when the prophet of god
[1:15:25] left amen but he is still here
[1:15:28] with us he is here except
[1:15:31] he you know he is in his bright body
[1:15:34] the church of jesus christ now the
[1:15:37] pillar of fire
[1:15:38] provided light so the israelites could
[1:15:42] travel
[1:15:42] by night during their exodus from egypt
[1:15:46] and the bible connects a pillar of fire
[1:15:48] with the manifestation
[1:15:50] of the divine presence uh by day
[1:15:53] as a pillar of a cloud notice
[1:15:57] a cloud by day of fire by night
[1:16:01] so it could manifest itself as a cloud
[1:16:03] or could manifest itself as a light
[1:16:06] or could manifest itself as a man
[1:16:09] and all of these were theophenic
[1:16:11] presence
[1:16:12] and of course this this made it so that
[1:16:15] the children of israel
[1:16:17] could travel by night or by day and
[1:16:19] during
[1:16:20] israel's travel in the desert they
[1:16:23] traveling
[1:16:24] to the promised land uh jehovah
[1:16:27] continually would use this pillar of
[1:16:29] fire and cloud
[1:16:30] to lead his people they were a people
[1:16:33] directly
[1:16:34] led by the pillar of fire and
[1:16:37] when the pillar of fire would move
[1:16:39] forward the people of israel would
[1:16:42] pack up their tents and they would see
[1:16:45] it moving and they
[1:16:46] know it's time to move amen when you see
[1:16:49] it moving it's time to move
[1:16:52] and they would pack up camp and they
[1:16:54] would follow behind it and similarly
[1:16:56] when the pillar of fire was present
[1:16:58] stopped the israelite would
[1:17:00] set up a camp underneath it and the
[1:17:03] levites would set up the tabernacle
[1:17:06] of the lord directly under the pillar of
[1:17:09] fire or the cloud
[1:17:11] of the lord and this way that god's
[1:17:14] presence
[1:17:15] was was visibly in the center
[1:17:18] of the camp at all times amen he must
[1:17:22] stay
[1:17:22] at the center of the church this is
[1:17:25] where
[1:17:26] that by the preaching of the word every
[1:17:28] true levite or ever
[1:17:30] true preacher of the gospel must
[1:17:33] center the church directly under the
[1:17:36] pillar of fire
[1:17:38] amen because he is the one that is
[1:17:41] leading him it has to be directly
[1:17:43] under the word of god and so it would be
[1:17:46] from this pillar of fire that god's
[1:17:49] theophanic
[1:17:49] presence um where the word of god
[1:17:53] would come in the form of commandments
[1:17:56] upon mount sinai and would be given
[1:17:58] to moses now this was
[1:18:02] this is how the word the lord would come
[1:18:05] to the prophets
[1:18:06] this would be where that moses then
[1:18:08] would write
[1:18:09] the first five books of the old
[1:18:12] testaments
[1:18:13] and actually transferred the thoughts of
[1:18:16] god
[1:18:17] from god's thoughts to paper
[1:18:20] i i'm talking about we we have an
[1:18:22] amazing
[1:18:23] book called the bible
[1:18:27] amen because it it records the words
[1:18:30] that were uttered
[1:18:32] by almighty god and the thought in the
[1:18:34] plan
[1:18:35] of redemption i hope that you love your
[1:18:38] bible and you
[1:18:39] read your bible that it becomes a very
[1:18:43] well-worn book i mean it's very
[1:18:46] important you say well i tell you
[1:18:47] brother jim i'm just rejoicing and
[1:18:50] i'm just shouting over what god has done
[1:18:52] but you better pray and read your bible
[1:18:55] stay anchored in god's word are you with
[1:18:59] me because that's the way you get close
[1:19:01] to god
[1:19:01] it'll give you it'll make you ready for
[1:19:03] the next experience with god you've seen
[1:19:06] there's other things about god that you
[1:19:08] can come to know that nobody
[1:19:10] has a right to remain in the same
[1:19:13] condition
[1:19:15] amen there's no excuse to be backslidden
[1:19:19] and if you're not going forward you're
[1:19:20] going backwards
[1:19:23] exactly right but as i say you know
[1:19:26] again
[1:19:27] here the commandments would be given to
[1:19:30] israel
[1:19:30] and he would get them from the pillar of
[1:19:33] fire
[1:19:34] i could see him almost as his finger of
[1:19:36] fire
[1:19:37] would go and write it in tables of stone
[1:19:41] and and of course what he wants to do
[1:19:43] now is
[1:19:44] take his finger of the pillar of fire
[1:19:47] and write his word
[1:19:49] in your very nature in your very heart
[1:19:53] and that's what our prayer is this
[1:19:55] morning it it'll be more than a sermon
[1:19:59] but it'll be an experience with the
[1:20:02] pillar of fire where
[1:20:03] he takes his fiery finger and writes in
[1:20:06] your nature
[1:20:07] to you and the word become one
[1:20:11] amen now these these words
[1:20:14] that were formed they were as we speak
[1:20:17] right now
[1:20:18] if you notice and yeah whether it's like
[1:20:21] brother joe said the other night you i'm
[1:20:23] not stupid but
[1:20:24] you know here's a definition of story
[1:20:27] well you know you're not stupid either
[1:20:29] but i but
[1:20:30] the words that come out of your mouth is
[1:20:32] your breath they come out by your breath
[1:20:35] is that right you breathe through your
[1:20:38] vocal cords and you express them with
[1:20:40] your tongue
[1:20:41] and form words so your words
[1:20:45] are your breath that is breathed out
[1:20:48] and you're speaking words as you do and
[1:20:51] so the bible said in second timothy 3
[1:20:53] 16 all scripture is given by
[1:20:56] inspiration of god now this
[1:20:59] this literally means all scripture is
[1:21:02] god
[1:21:02] breathe god uttered
[1:21:06] with his words with his breath and it is
[1:21:10] so it's god's breathe you cannot
[1:21:12] utter words without there being life in
[1:21:15] you
[1:21:15] and that life is is causing something to
[1:21:19] well up in you and come out the thoughts
[1:21:22] that's
[1:21:22] within your human spirit well god's
[1:21:24] spirit
[1:21:25] does the same thing that is that his
[1:21:28] life
[1:21:29] causes words to come out from his very
[1:21:32] mind and they become
[1:21:33] thoughts and then they become expressed
[1:21:36] to a prophet are you with me
[1:21:39] now so all scripture is breathed by god
[1:21:43] or
[1:21:43] or you know words are formed as i said
[1:21:46] uttered by your breath so god literally
[1:21:49] breathes out
[1:21:50] the scripture in other words god has
[1:21:54] transmitted his very substance
[1:21:57] into every scripture
[1:22:02] amen that's why it's it's a book that
[1:22:05] never goes old
[1:22:06] it's a by something that's eternal it
[1:22:10] it's not dated some with me somebody
[1:22:13] with me
[1:22:14] it's something that is as fresh today as
[1:22:17] when it was spoken then
[1:22:19] because it's eternal god substance
[1:22:22] right in the word and he said the words
[1:22:25] that i
[1:22:26] speak they are spirit and they are life
[1:22:30] so they're more than just words on the
[1:22:32] paper but they're a spirit
[1:22:34] expressing his very thoughts
[1:22:37] his very mind
[1:22:40] and his substance of his mind is uttered
[1:22:44] by the spirit now we're reading from the
[1:22:47] account of exodus
[1:22:49] the second book of moses and moses in
[1:22:52] the presence of this pillar of fire
[1:22:54] and the theophanic angel of the covenant
[1:22:57] he would receive
[1:22:58] a commission with signs of deliverance
[1:23:03] notice motives moses wrote as i've said
[1:23:05] the first five books of the bible
[1:23:08] the story of creation was revealed to a
[1:23:11] prophet
[1:23:12] by the hand of an angel amen moses would
[1:23:16] write
[1:23:16] in the beginning god created the heavens
[1:23:20] and the earth
[1:23:21] you know perhaps you know uh let's say
[1:23:25] the phoenician people
[1:23:26] they had their account of of how it all
[1:23:29] began
[1:23:30] maybe the the egyptians had all their
[1:23:32] accounts
[1:23:33] of how it all began you know perhaps the
[1:23:36] hebrews
[1:23:36] from you know had accounts of how it all
[1:23:39] began
[1:23:40] but moses would have to forget all of
[1:23:42] those accounts
[1:23:45] when he was in the prisons of god and he
[1:23:47] would come into god's presence
[1:23:49] and he would begin to receive revelation
[1:23:53] that would literally transport him back
[1:23:57] to the very beginning and he would see
[1:24:00] god
[1:24:01] created the heavens and the earth
[1:24:05] amen moses would would write that he
[1:24:08] would reveal even god's thoughts
[1:24:11] you know he would he would perhaps even
[1:24:14] hear and then repeat for us the
[1:24:17] conversations that you hear between
[1:24:20] uh from between adam and claude and the
[1:24:24] conversation between
[1:24:25] eve and the serpent and the conversation
[1:24:28] between eve
[1:24:30] and god moses would actually hear those
[1:24:33] conversations
[1:24:37] and he would write down what
[1:24:40] had happened because that is a gift of a
[1:24:44] prophet
[1:24:44] he is able to go up in the spirit and
[1:24:47] catch those things because they're all
[1:24:50] eternal they're
[1:24:51] all thoughts they're all they're all
[1:24:53] written out there
[1:24:54] in the in the very tape of god's word
[1:24:58] and man and so he can just be caught up
[1:25:01] in the spirit
[1:25:02] and go back all the way back to the
[1:25:04] beginning of creation
[1:25:12] now moses would reveal god's thoughts
[1:25:16] repeat these conversations and he would
[1:25:19] actually then confer
[1:25:21] god's thoughts back to man now
[1:25:25] how is this possible i mean this is
[1:25:27] incredible
[1:25:29] this is totally uh phenomenal beyond
[1:25:33] supernatural way beyond
[1:25:37] the comprehension of of human
[1:25:40] understanding
[1:25:42] you know we we learned in the prophetic
[1:25:44] ministry of brother branham that
[1:25:45] even club could come transporting him
[1:25:48] back 40 years
[1:25:50] i'm going to get you just a moment and
[1:25:52] say
[1:25:53] say to someone in the prayer line i
[1:25:56] see you are becoming a much younger
[1:25:59] person
[1:26:01] and he would watch them just shrink back
[1:26:04] to where
[1:26:05] they were no longer an old person
[1:26:08] standing
[1:26:09] maybe in their 60s 70s no 60s they know
[1:26:12] 70 years or 80s and and he could he
[1:26:15] could look back and he could say
[1:26:16] i see you're getting younger and he and
[1:26:20] he says you know you're you're you're
[1:26:22] about
[1:26:23] 12 years old now now can you imagine
[1:26:27] this
[1:26:27] go back till she's 12 years old
[1:26:31] and and he could see her in the
[1:26:32] classroom i see you
[1:26:34] in a classroom a school room
[1:26:37] and and all you hit your pen
[1:26:40] and it flew it flew up in the air and it
[1:26:42] struck you in the eye
[1:26:44] and it blinded your your eye and the
[1:26:47] woman
[1:26:48] began to scream and said brother branham
[1:26:50] that was me i'm blind in my right eye
[1:26:54] well that would pull him from the vision
[1:26:56] for a moment and he would stand back
[1:26:58] a moment and he'd say uh uh wait just a
[1:27:02] minute
[1:27:02] he says i see you now you're about
[1:27:06] 16 years old and he said
[1:27:09] you you're out on uh on the
[1:27:13] and you're walking you look like maybe
[1:27:15] going to school or something
[1:27:17] you have a checkered dress you have a
[1:27:20] big ribbon in your hair
[1:27:22] you have double braids hanging down your
[1:27:24] back
[1:27:26] and oh yeah now you're running
[1:27:29] or you're running from something i see
[1:27:30] what it is you're running from a big
[1:27:32] yellow dog
[1:27:34] and he said you ran up onto a porch and
[1:27:36] a woman now
[1:27:37] opens up her door and quickly you ran in
[1:27:41] and she says brother brandon i thought
[1:27:44] of that in years but that's exactly the
[1:27:46] truth that was me
[1:27:47] well then he said then he says now i see
[1:27:50] you
[1:27:51] it's at the age you are now and you're
[1:27:54] coming from a red barn
[1:27:56] of fri and you're walking toward a house
[1:27:59] real slow
[1:28:01] and there's steps going up this way and
[1:28:04] as you do
[1:28:05] there's a flower bed here to your right
[1:28:08] and it said as you as you will start at
[1:28:11] the steps
[1:28:12] you're you're leaning sideways and
[1:28:15] you're crying from the pain
[1:28:17] and you're saying if i can ever get to
[1:28:20] brother branham's
[1:28:21] meeting it'll all be over
[1:28:26] and when he said that that you know
[1:28:28] somebody
[1:28:29] actually had to catch the woman she
[1:28:31] started she she fainted because
[1:28:34] no because of that but when she came to
[1:28:36] her blind eye was
[1:28:37] normal and she could move her back
[1:28:40] anyway and her
[1:28:41] arthritis was completely healed
[1:28:47] now this is just one of the thousands of
[1:28:51] incidences you know the word that god
[1:28:55] provided to us
[1:28:56] that the word as the word discerned the
[1:29:00] heart
[1:29:01] that the word of the lord that we can
[1:29:03] say came to a prophet
[1:29:06] and just as moses could stand and watch
[1:29:09] all creation
[1:29:10] unfold the creation of man the fall of
[1:29:13] man and write it in the bible
[1:29:15] right down to the conversations so god
[1:29:18] would use the prophets of the bible to
[1:29:21] write the word of god
[1:29:23] for god reveals his secrets to his
[1:29:26] servants the prophets
[1:29:28] amen amos 3 and 7
[1:29:31] surely the lord god will do nothing but
[1:29:34] he reveals his secrets
[1:29:36] to his servants the prophets so god used
[1:29:40] the prophets of the bible
[1:29:41] to write the word of god and for god
[1:29:44] reveals those secrets
[1:29:46] to his prophets this is god's way of
[1:29:49] revealing his word
[1:29:52] are you with me so even that that light
[1:29:54] i wanted to take for a moment
[1:29:56] that was that light would take the
[1:29:58] prophet
[1:29:59] to the river jordan and even let him see
[1:30:02] the baptism of jesus
[1:30:06] amen i mean when when you know he would
[1:30:09] talk about
[1:30:10] how that you know when he was a young
[1:30:12] preacher
[1:30:13] and then coming up in the in the church
[1:30:16] that
[1:30:16] uh as a lay member or lay minister
[1:30:18] rather of the church
[1:30:20] and brother roy davis was kind of
[1:30:22] instructed him and say you know
[1:30:24] we're baptists and we believe in baptism
[1:30:27] and john hadn't been baptized so when
[1:30:28] jesus
[1:30:30] got baptized to john he said suffered me
[1:30:33] so to fulfill all righteousness so then
[1:30:35] jesus turned around and baptized john
[1:30:39] so you know you know
[1:30:43] um so you know he had those
[1:30:46] little talks and brother brown said it
[1:30:48] just didn't settle right with me and he
[1:30:50] said you know
[1:30:51] i don't know good doctor about whether
[1:30:53] that's true or not i don't know i i
[1:30:56] i i do you know that sounds good it
[1:30:59] sounds fine
[1:31:00] for john to baptize jesus and then
[1:31:03] jesus turned around and baptized john
[1:31:05] but you know he said um
[1:31:08] i don't know but he said one day about
[1:31:10] two years ago
[1:31:12] out in the woods where i was sitting the
[1:31:14] holy spirit came down the light
[1:31:17] and then i saw it when he revealed it
[1:31:22] can you imagine now i mean this is
[1:31:24] different from
[1:31:25] somebody guessing what was happening
[1:31:28] there
[1:31:29] and i am supposing what took place this
[1:31:32] is someone that glob could take and sit
[1:31:34] around standing right there
[1:31:36] on the river jordan and watch the whole
[1:31:38] thing happen
[1:31:40] and i just want to say you can't argue
[1:31:42] with somebody that was there
[1:31:46] that's what a real witness is come on
[1:31:49] that's why
[1:31:50] in the last age that god said the
[1:31:52] faithful and true witness
[1:31:54] amen because god would bring a witness
[1:31:58] to the scripture like none other
[1:32:01] so that we gentiles in this last day
[1:32:04] could be sure as we stand on the cusp of
[1:32:06] the rapture
[1:32:07] that we can know this is a truth that
[1:32:10] has been restored
[1:32:11] that the same one that the pillar of
[1:32:13] fire brought in the beginning is the
[1:32:15] same one the pillar of fire revealed
[1:32:18] in the end time
[1:32:22] now he would explain that and he said
[1:32:25] jesus said
[1:32:27] you know it's becoming to us we fulfill
[1:32:30] all righteousness and jesus being god
[1:32:33] john being the prophet quickly jesus
[1:32:35] knew um that he that john would
[1:32:38] understand it because
[1:32:40] him being a prophet the word came to and
[1:32:43] he said because
[1:32:44] the sacrifice according to the law had
[1:32:46] to be washed before it was presented
[1:32:49] and that is true they would take the
[1:32:51] sacrifice and wash between
[1:32:52] its legs and different parts of it
[1:32:55] before they offered it
[1:32:58] now so again and jesus said but suffered
[1:33:01] to be so
[1:33:02] so he could see the very thing now this
[1:33:05] is the way
[1:33:05] the truth and revelation has always
[1:33:09] come amen this is the bible way
[1:33:14] i mean in our day education and
[1:33:16] knowledge it's thought
[1:33:18] that the true knowledge of god can only
[1:33:20] come from the high schools of knowledge
[1:33:22] and learning
[1:33:24] but but by the way which one of those
[1:33:27] schools of learning
[1:33:28] is really ordained of god how many
[1:33:32] why is it liberty university is it
[1:33:34] dallas seminary
[1:33:36] theological seminary is it moody
[1:33:39] theological seminary and graduate school
[1:33:41] in chicago
[1:33:43] which one is it i mean is it is
[1:33:46] it the university of notre dame
[1:33:49] or is it the holy greek orthodox school
[1:33:51] of theology in massachusetts
[1:33:54] or is it a princeton university
[1:33:56] cemeteries
[1:33:57] cemetery you know is it a
[1:34:00] loyola university in chicago
[1:34:04] is it yale divinity school
[1:34:07] is it the methodist university which one
[1:34:10] of these
[1:34:12] in fact the matter is there's about 40
[1:34:14] 000 denominations and they probably all
[1:34:17] have their school
[1:34:19] amen so which one of them was god
[1:34:21] ordained
[1:34:23] that a pillar of fire appeared to
[1:34:28] amen i want to ask did an angel visit
[1:34:30] them
[1:34:31] were they were there theologians taught
[1:34:34] by an angel
[1:34:36] you know if i graduate from loyola
[1:34:39] university with a summa laude
[1:34:43] an honorary ti that's an honorary title
[1:34:46] of highest distinction
[1:34:48] did god give that to me or did man do it
[1:34:52] well paul said i i graduated a pharisee
[1:34:56] of the pharisee
[1:34:57] i graduated summa laude
[1:35:01] but i counted it but done that i might
[1:35:04] win christ
[1:35:05] and i certify you brethren that the
[1:35:08] gospel which was preached to me
[1:35:10] is not after man
[1:35:13] i didn't get this in a degree from man
[1:35:15] of some summer
[1:35:17] come larry i got in the presence of the
[1:35:19] pillar of fire
[1:35:21] that light i met on the road to damascus
[1:35:24] and it was their god
[1:35:25] revealed to me and separated from me the
[1:35:29] law
[1:35:29] from grace
[1:35:31] [Applause]
[1:35:35] and let me just tell you god bestowed
[1:35:37] more than an honorary title
[1:35:39] of summa laude upon william branham
[1:35:43] he gave him the title of a prophet
[1:35:46] amen and what must the prophet do is
[1:35:49] seek out the will
[1:35:50] the word of god he must do it because
[1:35:53] being a prophet the word of the lord
[1:35:55] comes to him
[1:35:57] they said to brother branham and this is
[1:35:59] what his critics say
[1:36:01] well he's not a theologian well never
[1:36:04] does the bible say the word of god comes
[1:36:06] to theologian
[1:36:07] nowhere they're the ones who messes it
[1:36:10] up
[1:36:11] the word of god comes to a prophet
[1:36:15] now what made moses message incredible
[1:36:18] what what if he to come
[1:36:20] with the commandments without signs
[1:36:22] first
[1:36:25] huh what if he'd come and said now i've
[1:36:27] been out here 40 years
[1:36:29] i met god in the wilderness it was a
[1:36:32] light a pillar of fire
[1:36:33] so this is all real real um
[1:36:37] phenomenal real i mean this is a big
[1:36:40] tale
[1:36:41] now you're coming out and i met god he
[1:36:44] took and wrote with his fingers on ten
[1:36:46] commandments
[1:36:47] on stone and and here i have these
[1:36:50] stones right here
[1:36:51] this is what you're to do oh israel
[1:36:55] you see you see what if he would appear
[1:36:58] without the signs and making claims
[1:37:02] of the appearance of the i am god in a
[1:37:04] burning bush
[1:37:06] this would just been a fantastic story
[1:37:10] come on without signs they would have
[1:37:13] never believed him
[1:37:15] but after turning a rod into a serpent
[1:37:18] after a leper's hand was thrust into his
[1:37:20] bosom
[1:37:21] and cleansed after 10 pledged and time
[1:37:25] after time
[1:37:25] it never failed israel believed him and
[1:37:29] got up and left with him
[1:37:31] and went to a promised land
[1:37:35] a land they had never seen come on
[1:37:38] somebody
[1:37:39] amen where do you think we are going we
[1:37:41] are following a pillar of fire
[1:37:44] to a land that has never been seen
[1:37:48] one i've never laid my eyes on but i
[1:37:51] know it's there
[1:37:52] i know it's real yes i know it's real
[1:37:55] [Applause]
[1:37:58] wow something's happened in my heart
[1:38:01] because i've seen the signs of
[1:38:03] vindication
[1:38:05] and after thousands of accurate pinpoint
[1:38:09] discernments
[1:38:10] after thousands of miracles and healings
[1:38:13] proven the presence of the angel of god
[1:38:16] we can believe the message
[1:38:20] of this messenger when he said i was in
[1:38:23] the wilderness
[1:38:28] i'm going to tell you without that
[1:38:31] talking about coming back and giving a
[1:38:33] fantastic story i said
[1:38:35] let there come a squirrel and there come
[1:38:36] a squirrel there oh yeah right
[1:38:40] i was there in the wilderness and i
[1:38:42] spoke to a storm and
[1:38:44] it dissipated oh yeah right
[1:38:48] i was there i was there you know
[1:38:51] you know in in a room and i spoke to a
[1:38:54] tumor 1500 miles away
[1:38:56] and it left well the tumor left but
[1:38:59] didn't have anything to do with you
[1:39:03] it just was a mistake
[1:39:07] it's kind of like our grandson jude
[1:39:10] after coming back and you know seeing
[1:39:13] the
[1:39:14] with the the proof of the the kidneys
[1:39:16] and the enlarged
[1:39:17] kidney and the the other shrunken and
[1:39:20] you know
[1:39:20] only working a certain percentage and
[1:39:23] and
[1:39:24] and you know and and coming up for
[1:39:27] prayer and
[1:39:28] the baby who would not even wet his
[1:39:30] diaper at night
[1:39:32] but next day after prayer start witness
[1:39:35] diapers every night
[1:39:37] soggy diapers take him back to the
[1:39:40] doctor and he said
[1:39:41] well somebody just made a mistake in in
[1:39:43] their test
[1:39:47] you know it's easy to dismiss when
[1:39:49] you're an unbeliever
[1:39:52] you don't have anything in you to
[1:39:54] believe god could do things a thousand
[1:39:56] times
[1:39:57] thousands of times over and over and
[1:40:00] over again
[1:40:00] jesus said it wouldn't do any good for
[1:40:03] you if one raised from the dead you
[1:40:05] wouldn't believe and jesus did raise
[1:40:09] from the dead and they don't believe
[1:40:15] we can believe the message of the
[1:40:16] messenger when he says
[1:40:19] i was out there in the wilderness i'm
[1:40:22] getting this now from the message of
[1:40:23] grace
[1:40:25] and i looked as i went down to sportsman
[1:40:28] hollow and something said turn this way
[1:40:30] and go there and i looked
[1:40:32] and i saw and there was
[1:40:35] their three rainbows
[1:40:39] and they were growing taller and taller
[1:40:41] and as i saw those
[1:40:42] rainbows there coming up about a
[1:40:46] look at like out of the ground you know
[1:40:48] rare right at ground
[1:40:50] level and and they were going up and
[1:40:51] they're pulsating
[1:40:53] and he says i sat down my gun i started
[1:40:57] walking closer
[1:40:58] went towards my towards it with my hands
[1:41:01] up
[1:41:02] and something seemed to tell me this is
[1:41:03] close enough and
[1:41:05] he said i was actually gonna sit down
[1:41:07] and take my boots off and
[1:41:09] see if i could walk a little closer and
[1:41:11] i got within a few yards of it
[1:41:13] i could see the color of it it was
[1:41:14] misting like a fog
[1:41:16] around and i stood still for a few
[1:41:18] moments
[1:41:19] it was right coming right off the top of
[1:41:21] that little mountain
[1:41:22] and as i watched the three one to the
[1:41:25] right and
[1:41:26] one to the left and the other in the
[1:41:28] center and running down into the
[1:41:30] into a bowl like a fair and and said
[1:41:32] whatever it was was alive
[1:41:36] amen it was moving it was making its
[1:41:39] motions and i stood there
[1:41:41] just as it was gray and dawn and i
[1:41:43] turned and i looked and i said
[1:41:45] and i screamed out oh god what would you
[1:41:49] have your servant
[1:41:50] know and just then the spirit of god
[1:41:54] came in and said
[1:41:55] jesus of the new testament is the
[1:41:58] jehovah of the old
[1:42:01] he only changed his mass from spirit to
[1:42:04] man
[1:42:06] and that was confirmed and of course my
[1:42:08] message of him
[1:42:09] let me know assured that these 31 years
[1:42:11] has not been in vain
[1:42:14] hallelujah amen can you imagine we have
[1:42:18] the
[1:42:18] truth of the godhead it is absolutely
[1:42:22] confirmed by the angel of god
[1:42:24] it's not a prophet's message of his own
[1:42:27] mind
[1:42:27] it's the mind of god expressed
[1:42:32] are you with me and it says jesus of the
[1:42:35] new testament
[1:42:36] is jehovah of the old he only changed
[1:42:39] his
[1:42:40] mass from spirit to mind how can you
[1:42:42] message believers
[1:42:44] come along and get two lords out of that
[1:42:46] how long how can you get
[1:42:48] more than one god or jesus a lesser god
[1:42:51] than god
[1:42:52] how can you imagine all of that kind of
[1:42:54] nonsense
[1:42:55] you've only could get that from a
[1:42:57] theologian you'd never get that from a
[1:42:59] prophet of god
[1:43:00] a prophet of god went in the presence of
[1:43:02] god and said
[1:43:03] the jesus of the new testament is the
[1:43:06] jehovah
[1:43:07] of the old testament
[1:43:11] i certify to you brethren that this
[1:43:15] which we receive
[1:43:16] is not a man it is a god it didn't come
[1:43:19] from
[1:43:20] the catholic university of loyola it
[1:43:23] didn't come
[1:43:24] from harvard it didn't come from a
[1:43:25] school of learning
[1:43:27] it wasn't summa laude backed up with
[1:43:29] a diploma by man
[1:43:31] and certified by man it was certified by
[1:43:34] god himself
[1:43:38] he said when i seen them rainbows about
[1:43:41] as wide
[1:43:42] as across that hair that halo is
[1:43:45] that angel of the lord but there were
[1:43:48] three
[1:43:48] of them running into one oh my
[1:43:52] how it helped my heart to know that god
[1:43:55] that
[1:43:55] jesus is not just a man as people think
[1:43:58] he is
[1:43:59] just a prophet is this modern-day idea
[1:44:02] today
[1:44:03] thinks that jesus was just a prophet he
[1:44:06] is jehovah of the old testament
[1:44:08] made flesh and dwelt among us amen and
[1:44:12] he said that sure did comfort me
[1:44:14] well i'll tell you what i'm comforted
[1:44:16] too by
[1:44:19] hallelujah amen we might have had men
[1:44:22] that could speak in tongues and prophecy
[1:44:24] and and it's sounding just rattled off
[1:44:26] like oh it was wonderful
[1:44:28] but i'll tell you what this prophet was
[1:44:30] more than a speaker a tongue
[1:44:33] and a prophesier he was a prophet of god
[1:44:36] amen he was the seventh angel to the
[1:44:39] last church age
[1:44:40] come on church amen and and there he
[1:44:44] walked into the presence of god
[1:44:46] and came out with revelation and that's
[1:44:48] what we believe
[1:44:50] because it's revelation by divine
[1:44:53] vindication
[1:44:57] he says again in the message of grace
[1:44:59] now jesus christ dwells in the people
[1:45:02] that's where he dwells now one day
[1:45:05] christ was in a pillar of fire
[1:45:07] that's the one you've seen taken find
[1:45:09] that that picture and
[1:45:10] keep it up here till we change verses
[1:45:13] one day christ was in a pillar of fire
[1:45:17] that one you see taken and we believe it
[1:45:20] to be jehovah god that's what
[1:45:22] the angel was trying to get to us
[1:45:25] notice brother branham bringing this out
[1:45:28] he said this is what the angel was
[1:45:30] trying to get to us
[1:45:31] now this is no theologian trying to pass
[1:45:33] on his reasoning
[1:45:36] this is what the angel is trying to get
[1:45:38] to you
[1:45:40] amen that now he was in the fatherhood
[1:45:43] then
[1:45:44] he was the father of israel a nation
[1:45:46] then he come down
[1:45:48] and dwelt among his people as christ the
[1:45:50] son
[1:45:51] is that right christ was the son of god
[1:45:53] now he's christ the holy spirit
[1:45:56] which is the anointing christ means the
[1:45:58] anointed anointed one upon the people
[1:46:01] christ with us the holy spirit is christ
[1:46:03] in us
[1:46:04] and then the holy spirit is christ with
[1:46:07] us
[1:46:08] in us notice notice now this is so
[1:46:12] this is so wonderful when i think
[1:46:16] where our faith is
[1:46:22] our faith is not in
[1:46:25] an old mother church
[1:46:31] that has twisted the words of what was
[1:46:33] supposed to be her husband from for
[1:46:35] thousands of years
[1:46:38] until they've got it molded into
[1:46:39] something that don't even resemble the
[1:46:41] bible
[1:46:46] i'm glad our hope is there brother
[1:46:48] brethren again
[1:46:49] let your light so shine see said jesus
[1:46:52] said the new testament is jehovah the
[1:46:53] old he just changed his veil
[1:46:56] when i said studying that i find the
[1:46:58] same word where he changed his
[1:46:59] countenance in the
[1:47:00] in the greek didn't mean changing his
[1:47:03] mask
[1:47:03] not exactly his veil but his mask and it
[1:47:06] come to place he was transformed
[1:47:08] and that means he changed his way he was
[1:47:11] jehovah god
[1:47:12] and jehovah god changed himself from a
[1:47:14] spirit
[1:47:15] and become a man he's the same jehovah
[1:47:17] god
[1:47:18] which that was the father and this is
[1:47:21] the son being the same
[1:47:23] person
[1:47:26] how do we get two gods out of that how
[1:47:28] do we get two lords in there
[1:47:30] how do we get god and his son jesus
[1:47:33] out of that they're the same person
[1:47:38] that's what the angel revealed amen
[1:47:41] now you know i'm going to show you where
[1:47:43] this is important here in a moment but
[1:47:45] and then balaam of god brother branham
[1:47:47] brings it again jehovah the old
[1:47:49] testament is the jesus
[1:47:51] of the new testament he is the same god
[1:47:53] just changing his form
[1:47:55] that's right amen now somebody said the
[1:47:58] other day a baptist minister
[1:48:00] in tucson said how can you say
[1:48:03] that jesus and god would be the same
[1:48:06] person
[1:48:07] and i said well it would be very easy if
[1:48:09] you let your own thinking get away
[1:48:12] and think bible terms of it they are the
[1:48:15] south same being
[1:48:18] god is a spirit and jesus jesus is the
[1:48:21] body
[1:48:21] that he was veiled in i said like in my
[1:48:24] home to my wife i'm her husband
[1:48:26] i have a young daughter rebecca i'm her
[1:48:28] father i have a grandson his name is
[1:48:31] paul
[1:48:32] i'm his grandfather i'm a husband a
[1:48:34] father and a grandfather
[1:48:36] my wife has no claims of me as a father
[1:48:39] or grandfather she
[1:48:40] can't has claims of me alone as husband
[1:48:43] my daughter has no claims of me as
[1:48:45] husband
[1:48:46] or grandfather she is my child but yet
[1:48:49] all these three
[1:48:50] persons is the same person
[1:48:53] that's god father son and holy ghost
[1:48:57] is just dispensation claims god
[1:49:00] is same the same god
[1:49:03] amen god changed himself changed his
[1:49:05] form if you notice
[1:49:07] in philippians he said now not thinking
[1:49:10] of robbery but he took on the
[1:49:12] form of man now the greek word there in
[1:49:14] that form
[1:49:15] i've been looking at it all day
[1:49:17] yesterday trying to think of what it was
[1:49:19] and i couldn't find out
[1:49:21] what to come up with this word and
[1:49:23] morphe
[1:49:24] and that means that he changed himself
[1:49:28] he come down in other words he
[1:49:30] condescended
[1:49:31] now the greek word that means something
[1:49:34] that could not be seen
[1:49:36] yet it's there and then it's changed so
[1:49:39] the eye can
[1:49:39] catch it this is exactly what god did
[1:49:44] he changed forms he could not be seen as
[1:49:47] the invisible god
[1:49:49] so he comes and he changes form and
[1:49:52] becomes a man
[1:49:54] so the eye can catch it
[1:49:57] all right we'll go to philippians 2 and
[1:49:59] 5 and we'll see
[1:50:00] where where this is written
[1:50:05] philippians 2 and 5. let this mind be in
[1:50:08] you which was also in christ
[1:50:10] jesus who being in the form
[1:50:13] now that word is morphe and the form of
[1:50:16] god
[1:50:17] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:50:19] god
[1:50:21] so he was there first in the form of god
[1:50:24] he didn't believe it was wrong to be god
[1:50:27] come on and to show himself as god but
[1:50:31] he
[1:50:31] made of himself no repetition
[1:50:34] and took upon him the form the morphe
[1:50:38] of a servant and was made in the
[1:50:40] likeness of men
[1:50:42] and being found in fashion as a man he
[1:50:45] humbled himself and became obedient
[1:50:47] to death even the death of cross so you
[1:50:50] see for the purpose of
[1:50:52] dying he changes his form
[1:50:55] to become a man for the purpose of
[1:50:59] of giving or making himself to sacrifice
[1:51:03] to pay
[1:51:03] for your sins and my sins so in the
[1:51:07] unveiling of god brother brown said so
[1:51:09] that's what i'm trying to say
[1:51:10] that god has always was is the god that
[1:51:14] always was
[1:51:15] is here the only thing he
[1:51:18] done when he become man he changed his
[1:51:21] mask
[1:51:23] you see he he this is a morphing
[1:51:26] he changed himself to what he was to
[1:51:29] what he is
[1:51:30] and his mask to another act so he would
[1:51:33] change his form
[1:51:35] and he would appear as elohim
[1:51:38] and then he would appear to abraham as
[1:51:41] el shaddai
[1:51:43] the i am the almighty god
[1:51:47] amen and then he would change again to
[1:51:51] melchizedek the priest king
[1:51:56] come on amen because it would be there
[1:51:59] that would reflect the coming of another
[1:52:01] priesthood
[1:52:03] that would not come from levi
[1:52:06] because jesus would be born of judah but
[1:52:08] he would be a priest of the order of
[1:52:10] melchizedek
[1:52:12] and would be priest king
[1:52:15] somebody with me now amen now so again
[1:52:18] he would change his form it would be
[1:52:20] elohim it would be a shady eye the
[1:52:22] breasted god
[1:52:23] it would be melchizedek
[1:52:28] all of these forms and it would be
[1:52:30] jehovah
[1:52:31] jehovah there that he would reveal
[1:52:33] himself upon the mount
[1:52:35] all of these and all this you know
[1:52:38] abraham never got confused
[1:52:40] he knew it was the same god
[1:52:44] amen revealing himself as elohim
[1:52:47] as as el shaddai as melchizedek
[1:52:51] or however and let me tell you it was
[1:52:53] the same god
[1:52:55] that created himself a body and came in
[1:52:57] jesus
[1:53:00] and who is this melchizedek he said now
[1:53:02] we find out this person melchizedek
[1:53:04] had no father no mother no beginning of
[1:53:07] days or ending life it was god
[1:53:09] in morphe the world the
[1:53:12] the word comes the greek word means to
[1:53:15] change
[1:53:16] was used um changing himself and
[1:53:19] morphing from one person uh the greek
[1:53:22] word there in morphic means it was taken
[1:53:24] from the stage act
[1:53:25] that one person is changing his mask to
[1:53:28] make another character
[1:53:30] the english word you know that we would
[1:53:33] use
[1:53:33] is morph you know the morph would change
[1:53:36] from one image to another
[1:53:40] right amen you know and and so
[1:53:43] you can you they use it a lot of times
[1:53:46] in in cartoons and things like that
[1:53:48] where they'll take a
[1:53:49] character and he will morph all of a
[1:53:52] sudden into another
[1:53:54] creature you know this is what god would
[1:53:57] do
[1:53:57] he would morph himself in morphe
[1:54:01] he would change his form from spirit
[1:54:05] to man and then back to spirit again
[1:54:10] for jesus said i come from god and i go
[1:54:13] back to god
[1:54:14] i came from god is the spirit that's
[1:54:16] what i was
[1:54:17] i become a man and i'm going back to
[1:54:20] spirit again
[1:54:22] now then he explains he said like
[1:54:25] recently i was
[1:54:26] i believe rebecca just before she
[1:54:28] graduated they had
[1:54:29] one of the shakespeare's plays and one
[1:54:32] man changed his clothes several times
[1:54:33] because he played two or three different
[1:54:35] parts but the same person he come out
[1:54:37] next time
[1:54:38] one time he's a villain when he comes
[1:54:40] out another time he's another character
[1:54:42] now
[1:54:43] the greek word in morphing means he
[1:54:45] changed his mask
[1:54:46] and he said that's what god did it's the
[1:54:50] same god all the time
[1:54:51] god in the form of the father the spirit
[1:54:54] the pillar of fire the same god was made
[1:54:57] flesh and dwelt among us
[1:54:58] in morphe brought out so he could be
[1:55:02] seen
[1:55:02] as jesus is said of jesus you know
[1:55:06] no man has seen god at any time but the
[1:55:08] only begotten of the father he had
[1:55:09] declared him
[1:55:11] and now the same god is the holy ghost
[1:55:14] father son holy not three gods three
[1:55:17] offices three acts of the one god
[1:55:20] and when the bible said there is one god
[1:55:22] not three that's how they couldn't you
[1:55:24] can't get this straightened out and have
[1:55:26] three gods
[1:55:26] you could never sell a jew that i'll
[1:55:29] tell you that one who knows better
[1:55:31] he knows there's only one god
[1:55:35] god and morphy and mask and a pillar of
[1:55:37] our god and mouth
[1:55:39] and morphy in a man cry called jesus
[1:55:42] god and morphy in his church god above
[1:55:45] us god with us
[1:55:46] god in us the condescending of god
[1:55:51] up there holy no one could touch him
[1:55:53] settle up on a mountain even if a
[1:55:55] animal touched the mountain had to die
[1:55:58] and then when god came and changed his
[1:56:00] tent
[1:56:00] and come down and lived with us become
[1:56:03] one of us and we beheld him that
[1:56:05] the bible said first timothy 3 16
[1:56:07] without
[1:56:08] controversy great is a mystery of
[1:56:11] godliness for god
[1:56:12] was manifested in the flesh handled with
[1:56:15] hands
[1:56:16] you notice that god was manifest in
[1:56:20] flesh amen you know he said god
[1:56:24] ate meat god drank water
[1:56:27] god slept god cried
[1:56:31] he was one of us beautiful typed out in
[1:56:33] the bible that was god above us
[1:56:35] god with us now it's god in us the holy
[1:56:38] spirit
[1:56:38] not the third person the same person
[1:56:42] god came down and became flesh and died
[1:56:46] to death in christ so that god so he
[1:56:49] could clean the church
[1:56:50] in order to get into it for fellowship
[1:56:53] god
[1:56:53] loves fellowship and that's what he made
[1:56:56] man for at the first time
[1:56:57] was for fellowship god dwelled along
[1:56:59] with cherubims and he made man
[1:57:01] man fell so he came down redeemed man
[1:57:04] because god
[1:57:05] loves to be worshipped and the very main
[1:57:08] word god means object of worship
[1:57:11] and this comes from this that comes
[1:57:13] among us as a pillar of fire
[1:57:15] as something that changes our heart
[1:57:17] that's the same god
[1:57:19] listen church that's the same god that
[1:57:22] said
[1:57:23] let there be lights
[1:57:27] amen we've been singing there's power in
[1:57:29] the name of jesus there's power in the
[1:57:30] pride of jesus
[1:57:33] because the same life the same god the
[1:57:36] same holy ghost the same spirit of
[1:57:38] christ
[1:57:38] that dwelts in the corporal body of
[1:57:41] jesus is now here in bride form
[1:57:45] that's what he was showing through
[1:57:46] brother bradley's ministry he wasn't in
[1:57:48] the heavens he's right here on the earth
[1:57:50] working in bright people
[1:57:53] [Applause]
[1:57:56] his attitude to save toward the sinner
[1:58:00] come on don't go to tell me days of
[1:58:02] mercy and grace is over
[1:58:04] his attitude is the same towards sinner
[1:58:07] his attitude is sustained toward the
[1:58:09] lost
[1:58:10] his attitude's the same toward the sick
[1:58:15] amen no matter how lost in sin you are
[1:58:18] he's
[1:58:18] attitude is the same as he said to the
[1:58:22] woman at the well
[1:58:23] hey man leave your pot go go tell them
[1:58:26] there's a man here
[1:58:28] a man that can discern your heart a man
[1:58:30] that can heal your body that can save
[1:58:33] your soul that can answer the thirst in
[1:58:35] your hearts
[1:58:37] [Applause]
[1:58:42] the same god that said let there be
[1:58:43] light and there was light he was the
[1:58:45] same yesterday today and forever
[1:58:48] now you know there's a christian science
[1:58:49] woman challenged brother branham on
[1:58:51] the deity of christ he said she come to
[1:58:53] him and said i got something one thing
[1:58:55] against you brother branham i said
[1:58:57] i love what you're doing but i still got
[1:58:59] one thing against you and he said well
[1:59:01] glory be one thing he said i must be
[1:59:04] doing pretty good
[1:59:04] all you got is one she said no really i
[1:59:07] got one thing
[1:59:08] said um you know i'll tell you my my
[1:59:11] beef with you
[1:59:12] is you brag too much on jesus
[1:59:16] can you imagine that well you know that
[1:59:18] same spirit got in the message
[1:59:23] oh yeah and man they didn't want you
[1:59:25] bragging on jesus no more he just
[1:59:28] he's not even god he's just a man
[1:59:32] you know again that same evil spirit got
[1:59:35] on others and tried to make brother
[1:59:36] branham god
[1:59:39] come on so well you know brother branham
[1:59:42] said well if that's all you got
[1:59:44] against me and that's all god has
[1:59:45] against me i hope that's all he got
[1:59:47] against me
[1:59:48] is i brag too much on jesus she said
[1:59:50] well you know you make him divine and he
[1:59:53] said
[1:59:54] she said i'll prove he wasn't divine and
[1:59:56] he said well if he was
[1:59:57] anything less than god he's the greatest
[1:59:59] deceiver the world ever had
[2:00:02] i said the holy ghost god overshadowed
[2:00:04] the virgin and created a blood cell in
[2:00:07] the womb
[2:00:07] and this blood cell was the son of god
[2:00:10] and through that blood we have remission
[2:00:12] of sins
[2:00:13] man knew nothing about that woman she
[2:00:16] said i never knew a man and that was god
[2:00:18] himself
[2:00:19] tabernacling with man god himself i said
[2:00:22] he was both man
[2:00:23] and god amen
[2:00:27] what was it it was god reconciling the
[2:00:30] world to himself
[2:00:33] amen oh my wake yourself up now i know
[2:00:35] you missed an hour of sleep and i'm not
[2:00:37] going to let you make it up in church
[2:00:41] you make me work hard i'll tell you i'll
[2:00:43] take my coat off and work harder
[2:00:47] put this over there come on pastor
[2:00:52] hallelujah
[2:00:54] he said well you make him divine oh
[2:00:58] he's either god or he's the greatest
[2:01:00] deceiver the world ever knew
[2:01:02] a man he was god amen
[2:01:07] listen let me just go he said anybody
[2:01:10] that ever amounted to a hill of beans
[2:01:14] has been people that believed he was god
[2:01:19] so if you don't get here you'll never
[2:01:22] amount to hillary beans
[2:01:23] i'm just quoting the prophet amen
[2:01:27] you know why because he was emphatic the
[2:01:29] whole church
[2:01:30] is built on that revelation
[2:01:33] jesus said on this rock i'll build my
[2:01:36] church
[2:01:37] spirit revealed truth of the supreme
[2:01:39] deity of jesus christ
[2:01:41] on this rock the spirit revealed truth
[2:01:44] of the deity of jesus christ
[2:01:46] on this rock i'll build my church it's
[2:01:49] only when
[2:01:50] the churches establish that the gates of
[2:01:52] hell cannot prevail against her
[2:01:54] so you see it's important that we
[2:01:57] understand and we know
[2:01:58] who this is among us
[2:02:03] god hiding himself in simplicity he said
[2:02:06] when he stood there on the cross he said
[2:02:07] if you're the son of god
[2:02:09] and won't you come down on that cross
[2:02:10] we'll believe you
[2:02:12] see the same things when they could
[2:02:15] think of this man
[2:02:16] doing a miracle then they couldn't deny
[2:02:19] that but to see him
[2:02:20] standing there the very god of creation
[2:02:24] now i know modern trend today tried to
[2:02:25] make him something of some other person
[2:02:28] but he was no other person but god
[2:02:30] himself and that's right today the
[2:02:32] modern friend said he's a great teacher
[2:02:34] he he was a prophet he's a great teacher
[2:02:36] and he was a prophet
[2:02:38] but he was more than a teacher he was
[2:02:40] more than a prophet he was god
[2:02:42] nothing less than god god was in christ
[2:02:45] reconciling his
[2:02:46] himself to the world jesus said it's not
[2:02:49] me that does the thing it's my father
[2:02:51] and he dwells in me as the father me he
[2:02:53] was god
[2:02:54] manifested in the flesh now who taught
[2:02:58] him the godhead
[2:03:02] he couldn't have got this from loyola
[2:03:06] that's a catholic university who
[2:03:09] believes in three persons
[2:03:11] that god has three people
[2:03:17] god in three person
[2:03:21] blessed trinity
[2:03:24] well i was off key and i was off tomb
[2:03:26] but that's what they are
[2:03:28] they're off-key and they're out of tune
[2:03:32] because there's no such thing as a
[2:03:34] trinity even in the bible
[2:03:38] never one time the word mentioned
[2:03:41] trinity it's an
[2:03:42] invention from rome
[2:03:48] nowhere in the bible is three persons in
[2:03:51] a god
[2:03:52] head represented
[2:03:59] nowhere does it say in the bible jesus
[2:04:01] was in the godhead
[2:04:06] but the fullness of the godhead was in
[2:04:08] him
[2:04:11] so who taught him to god you know there
[2:04:12] are certain seemingly
[2:04:14] well you know some some contradictions
[2:04:17] in the bible
[2:04:19] such as matthew 28 and 28 19
[2:04:23] won't you put that up for me let's just
[2:04:26] look at it
[2:04:27] we're going to baptize one this morning
[2:04:29] let's talk about this where some
[2:04:31] you know consider this a contradiction
[2:04:35] go ye therefore and teach all nations
[2:04:37] baptizing them in the name of the father
[2:04:39] and of the son and of the holy ghost
[2:04:41] say well brother tim there's three
[2:04:43] there's the father there's a son and
[2:04:44] there's the holy ghost that's reasoning
[2:04:49] you got that calculation by reasoning
[2:04:51] you didn't get that calculation from the
[2:04:53] bible
[2:04:55] come on look at it again go back back
[2:04:58] and baptize
[2:04:59] in what the name
[2:05:02] none of them are names they're all
[2:05:05] titles
[2:05:08] they're titles of one name
[2:05:12] isaiah 9 and 6. put it up for a moment
[2:05:16] let's see if his name isn't father let's
[2:05:18] see if his
[2:05:19] or his title is in father for unto us
[2:05:21] the child is born unto us the son is
[2:05:23] given
[2:05:23] the government shall be upon his
[2:05:25] shoulder and his name shall
[2:05:27] be called these things these are things
[2:05:29] his name will be called these
[2:05:31] these these are uh these are adjectives
[2:05:34] that will describe him
[2:05:36] first of all his name isn't wonderful
[2:05:38] but he sure is
[2:05:40] he is a counselor but that isn't his
[2:05:42] name he is the mighty god
[2:05:45] which means the warrior god and he
[2:05:47] certainly was he come to take on human
[2:05:49] battle
[2:05:50] he's also the everlasting father
[2:05:53] amen he's the prince of peace
[2:05:57] is that right these are all the titles
[2:05:59] of his
[2:06:00] name but he has a name and they shall
[2:06:03] call his name
[2:06:06] jesus jehovah the savior is what that
[2:06:10] means
[2:06:11] for he will save his people from their
[2:06:14] sin
[2:06:14] and the bible teaches you there is no
[2:06:16] other name
[2:06:17] given among men whereby we must be saved
[2:06:22] amen but matthew 28 19
[2:06:26] back up there again so here again and
[2:06:30] some would say
[2:06:31] well i know where you're going to next
[2:06:33] you're going to go to what old peter
[2:06:34] said i ain't going to believe what peter
[2:06:36] said i'm going to believe what old
[2:06:38] i'm only going to believe what jesus
[2:06:40] said i want you to read right down at
[2:06:42] the bottom right there
[2:06:44] and see who was it said that
[2:06:48] amen come on can anybody read it
[2:06:52] matthew matthew said
[2:06:55] jesus said that
[2:07:02] come on amen we're not arguing with
[2:07:06] matthew
[2:07:08] amen because he knew who he knew what
[2:07:11] the name was
[2:07:15] amen all of the apostles in the bible
[2:07:17] knew what that name was
[2:07:19] and when they carried this out all in
[2:07:21] the book of acts they carried it out
[2:07:23] and baptized them in the name of jesus
[2:07:25] christ
[2:07:26] every place in the bible where this
[2:07:29] scripture was put into practice was done
[2:07:31] that way until the romans got a hold of
[2:07:34] it
[2:07:34] and if you're baptized like that in in
[2:07:36] the titles of father son holy ghost
[2:07:38] number one you don't know who jesus is
[2:07:41] number two you've never taken on his
[2:07:44] name
[2:07:52] and he said do everything in word or
[2:07:55] deed do it all in
[2:07:57] the name of jesus christ
[2:08:02] so matthew said so are you going to
[2:08:05] believe matthew now or peter
[2:08:10] now jesus gives the keys to the kingdom
[2:08:13] to a man by the name of peter
[2:08:16] somebody with me he gives up keys to the
[2:08:18] kingdom to a man by the
[2:08:20] now he says the keys i don't have my
[2:08:22] keys with me you got keys on you
[2:08:25] no anybody got keys there's keys there's
[2:08:27] one come here
[2:08:31] so the key is given to open up
[2:08:35] the door this is what it's for is to
[2:08:39] stick in there
[2:08:42] and open the door now this is a
[2:08:44] father-son holy ghost key
[2:08:46] it won't open that door
[2:08:54] it might drive your car but it ain't
[2:08:56] gonna it ain't gonna open that door
[2:08:58] it's a father-son holy ghost key
[2:09:01] and it won't open the door but peter
[2:09:04] knew how to get the door open he said
[2:09:05] repent every one of you
[2:09:07] acts 2 38 repent every one of you
[2:09:10] amen and be baptized in the name of
[2:09:13] jesus christ
[2:09:14] what is the name here we got a name god
[2:09:18] has a name
[2:09:20] he was i am that i am in the beginning
[2:09:23] but now god has a name
[2:09:27] they don't even know how to pronounce
[2:09:29] his name i am that i
[2:09:31] am that loves to pronouncing but god
[2:09:33] gave us
[2:09:34] his name his name is jesus
[2:09:37] [Applause]
[2:09:41] and if you want to go into heaven
[2:09:47] you gotta have that key
[2:09:50] to go in that door because the door
[2:09:54] into heaven is jesus and you only get it
[2:09:58] through
[2:09:58] jesus amen and you've got to be filled
[2:10:01] with the spirit of jesus
[2:10:04] to get into heaven repent and be
[2:10:08] baptized every one of you
[2:10:09] in the name of jesus christ for
[2:10:11] remission of sin and you shall
[2:10:14] [Music]
[2:10:17] receive the holy ghost as a gift
[2:10:21] that's what that means receive the holy
[2:10:24] ghost
[2:10:24] as a gift it's the person of christ
[2:10:26] coming into you
[2:10:28] to dwell in you as the person the father
[2:10:31] came to dwell in jesus
[2:10:40] but who taught who taught brother
[2:10:42] branham the godhead
[2:10:43] you know when baptism one says baptize
[2:10:47] the name of the father
[2:10:48] pentecostals come along with the oneness
[2:10:51] moves
[2:10:52] just jesus only just baptize the name of
[2:10:54] jesus
[2:10:56] again they don't have the revelation
[2:11:00] that's why when i baptize always baptize
[2:11:03] quoting matthew 28
[2:11:04] 19 and saying in obedience to this
[2:11:08] divine command
[2:11:10] i baptize you in the name of the lord
[2:11:13] that's the father jesus that's the son
[2:11:16] the holy ghost that's the spirit
[2:11:21] but they're all in one
[2:11:24] you say brother tim they're not one like
[2:11:26] your finger no
[2:11:29] neither are they two like two fingers
[2:11:33] or three like three fingers but rather
[2:11:36] god was in christ
[2:11:38] reconciling the world to himself
[2:11:45] and so that one that was in jesus
[2:11:49] there in the body of jesus can come
[2:11:51] right
[2:11:52] here and be right with us
[2:11:56] [Music]
[2:11:58] and yet still be in the body of jesus
[2:12:05] just like the wind can be in minden and
[2:12:07] be right here now
[2:12:10] or it can be in california and be
[2:12:12] blowing all this way
[2:12:14] and the same wind now
[2:12:21] so once it's baptized in the name of the
[2:12:23] father and of the son the holy ghost the
[2:12:25] other says
[2:12:26] to administer baptism in the name of
[2:12:29] jesus christ so
[2:12:31] you know there's they seem to be this
[2:12:33] contradiction
[2:12:34] that god had explained i want you to
[2:12:36] watch the title
[2:12:38] brother branham's explaining the godhead
[2:12:41] and he said some of them said well i'll
[2:12:42] take what jesus
[2:12:43] said and not what peter said that's the
[2:12:46] dumbest thing i ever heard
[2:12:51] that was coined by the by the early
[2:12:53] trinitarian pentecostals when
[2:12:55] when the first uh the the first part
[2:12:58] the just the infancy of the revelation
[2:13:00] of the name of jesus was
[2:13:02] had come in they wow we don't believe
[2:13:04] what jesus said we're not going to
[2:13:06] believe what peter said
[2:13:11] and it wasn't even so much what jesus
[2:13:14] said is what matthew said jesus said
[2:13:16] and what peter was preaching was what
[2:13:18] jesus also said
[2:13:22] where do you think peter learned that
[2:13:25] how in the world does 100
[2:13:27] you know 2000 get the holy ghost after
[2:13:30] peter tells them to be baptized wrong
[2:13:32] then
[2:13:34] 3 000 souls added right
[2:13:37] amen so again he said if they're
[2:13:39] contrary to
[2:13:40] one another what do we what are we going
[2:13:43] on if it ain't all god
[2:13:44] if it all ain't god what part of the
[2:13:46] bible is right it's got to go inside and
[2:13:48] come together
[2:13:49] and only the revelation of god in our
[2:13:51] schools will never teach it
[2:13:52] it's a revelation that you must see
[2:13:56] and then if them two men jesus and peter
[2:13:58] were contrary to one another
[2:14:00] then what kind of bible are we reading
[2:14:03] how do i know whether john 14 is right
[2:14:05] or not
[2:14:06] how do i know where john 3 is right how
[2:14:09] do i know
[2:14:09] see but only the way i can have faith in
[2:14:13] god is to know that the bible is right
[2:14:15] and believe it is right
[2:14:16] and stay right with it though i don't
[2:14:18] understand that i move on
[2:14:20] it anyhow but when these contradictions
[2:14:23] come up i want you to hear this
[2:14:28] everybody wake up right now
[2:14:32] when these contradictions come up then i
[2:14:34] go before god to find out
[2:14:38] and the same angel that meets me in the
[2:14:41] meetings in the night
[2:14:42] is the same one who taught me this
[2:14:47] why so well why come back to the bible
[2:14:50] is taught
[2:14:50] by the angel of the covenant because it
[2:14:53] is
[2:14:54] time for the mysteries to be made known
[2:14:57] see what day we're living in daniel 12
[2:15:00] and 9 said he said go thy way daniel for
[2:15:02] the words are closed up
[2:15:03] and sealed until how long till the time
[2:15:06] of the end
[2:15:08] and many should be purified and made
[2:15:10] white and tried and the wicked just
[2:15:11] helped me
[2:15:12] do wickedly and none of the wicked shall
[2:15:14] understand but the wise shall
[2:15:16] understand are you with me now
[2:15:19] but when did he say it would be at the
[2:15:21] time of the end that these
[2:15:23] mysteries of the bible would be cleared
[2:15:25] up
[2:15:28] now again the end time message shall
[2:15:31] reveal it the last church age
[2:15:34] god ordained it until we come to the
[2:15:36] last church age after they
[2:15:38] lost the truth of the bible and they did
[2:15:42] and restoration sort of happened with
[2:15:44] luther wesley and each one adding a part
[2:15:46] back but
[2:15:47] again it took a prophet in this last day
[2:15:51] who went in the presence of the angel
[2:15:55] he didn't go to notre dame to get this
[2:15:59] he went into the presence of the pillar
[2:16:01] of fire like moses did like paul did
[2:16:04] like all of them did
[2:16:05] is somebody with me now amen
[2:16:10] he said the mystery the things the
[2:16:11] church bats her eyes and says it's
[2:16:13] nonsense
[2:16:14] the mystery of who jesus christ was not
[2:16:17] a third person
[2:16:18] not a second person not the third person
[2:16:20] but the
[2:16:21] person of god all
[2:16:24] all these other mysteries of god will be
[2:16:26] revealed because it's wrote in here in
[2:16:28] this book
[2:16:29] and be revealed to the end time
[2:16:31] generation
[2:16:32] now who in the world is going to come up
[2:16:34] and say well
[2:16:36] brandon make up your mind was he god or
[2:16:38] isn't he god
[2:16:40] he is god that's what he taught the
[2:16:42] whole thing
[2:16:44] amen that you need to make up your mind
[2:16:47] first of all get god in your heart and
[2:16:49] the holy spirit move it
[2:16:50] and get in the presence of god and he'll
[2:16:52] reveal and open up the thing to you
[2:16:56] you'll no longer have this double
[2:16:58] visions where you see two lords
[2:17:03] now and he said
[2:17:06] you know no wonder he says they said
[2:17:09] they couldn't see it no more in the
[2:17:10] seminaries and the schools and the
[2:17:12] nominations and the jews could see jesus
[2:17:14] being the messiah
[2:17:15] no wonder they try to think you're crazy
[2:17:17] no wonder they think you're foolish
[2:17:19] no wonder they can't understand why you
[2:17:21] don't clock up with them
[2:17:22] because there is a power and a vision
[2:17:25] behind it
[2:17:26] a word of god that's been revealed to
[2:17:29] get the church in order for the rapture
[2:17:30] and the going home
[2:17:32] yes many shall run to and fro and
[2:17:34] knowledge shall increase
[2:17:36] but thank god he's given us knowledge by
[2:17:38] the angel of god
[2:17:40] you see never was a trinity taught by
[2:17:43] the bible
[2:17:44] the bible let me tell you let's get it
[2:17:47] clear
[2:17:48] this bible is a one god bible
[2:17:53] amen junior romans 6 and 4 hero israel
[2:17:57] the lord our god is one lord
[2:18:02] and message people there never was two
[2:18:05] lords taught in the bible
[2:18:07] they ain't two lords zechariah
[2:18:10] 4 and 14 9 and the lord shall be king
[2:18:13] over all the earth and that day there
[2:18:16] shall be one lord
[2:18:17] and his name lord
[2:18:21] or his name one get it up there where
[2:18:24] you can see
[2:18:25] the lord shall be king over all the
[2:18:27] earth in that day and there shall be one
[2:18:29] lord in his name
[2:18:31] one
[2:18:35] now to this jesus agreed in mark
[2:18:38] 12 29 jesus answered him the first
[2:18:41] of all commandments is here o israel the
[2:18:44] lord thy god
[2:18:45] is one lord
[2:18:50] ephesians 4 and four there is one body
[2:18:52] and one spirit
[2:18:53] even as you're all called in one hope of
[2:18:56] your calling
[2:18:57] one lord one faith one baptism one god
[2:19:01] and father of all
[2:19:02] who is above all through all and in you
[2:19:04] all
[2:19:06] the same god is the one that is father
[2:19:09] of all
[2:19:10] come on somebody he is above all
[2:19:14] and he is now in you all that's the holy
[2:19:17] ghost
[2:19:18] now where did these people where do
[2:19:22] people get
[2:19:23] two lords from they get it from
[2:19:27] theologians
[2:19:29] i'm a student of the message you can't
[2:19:31] find this stuff in the
[2:19:33] in the message
[2:19:36] this is this was never a doctrine of
[2:19:38] brother brown never something
[2:19:40] formulated by it wasn't something ever
[2:19:42] taught by him he never said
[2:19:44] he never took a sermon and said okay
[2:19:46] we're preaching on two lords today
[2:19:50] you know it came from theologians and
[2:19:53] theologians get the word
[2:19:55] mixed up because you see they're made up
[2:19:59] by theories
[2:20:03] theory theologian
[2:20:06] theory a theory
[2:20:10] is a speculation and suppositions
[2:20:14] surmising and guessing without
[2:20:17] divine vindication
[2:20:21] i want you to understand what we have
[2:20:23] today wasn't surmised wasn't guest
[2:20:25] [Music]
[2:20:27] amen it was a prophet going in there in
[2:20:30] the midst of the pillar of fire
[2:20:32] and he's saying that jehovah the old
[2:20:33] testament is the jesus of the new
[2:20:36] it's the same god only changing his mask
[2:20:41] and if you've got a problem with that
[2:20:42] you've got a problem with the angel
[2:20:49] amen psalms 110 verse 1
[2:20:52] we're going to go through this for a
[2:20:54] minute the lord said unto my lord
[2:20:57] sit down at my right hand until i make
[2:21:00] thine enemies that footstool so now
[2:21:03] brother timothy now there's
[2:21:04] two lords because there's the lord and
[2:21:07] the lord that's
[2:21:08] two
[2:21:11] you're about as cross-eyed as the
[2:21:13] trinitarians are
[2:21:15] seeing three
[2:21:20] what are you saying here watch it now
[2:21:22] the lord that's jehovah
[2:21:23] how many agree with me capital o l o r d
[2:21:27] that's
[2:21:27] all in caps that represents jehovah
[2:21:30] the lord jehovah said unto
[2:21:33] my lord david the king
[2:21:38] sit down at my right hand until i
[2:21:41] make thine enemies my footstool so in
[2:21:44] other words meaning that god had
[2:21:45] positioned david upon the throne
[2:21:48] and he would sit in power and authority
[2:21:50] until all his enemies were conquered
[2:21:52] that's what this scripture means so
[2:21:55] jehovah said unto david
[2:21:58] amen he said unto him sit on the throne
[2:22:01] sit at my right hand you know sit in a
[2:22:04] position of power and authority
[2:22:07] until i make thy enemies my footstool
[2:22:11] now this became understood to me more
[2:22:14] than david
[2:22:15] but now a messianic prophecy
[2:22:19] whereas the messiah the son of david of
[2:22:21] the tribe of judah
[2:22:23] would come and would sit and be
[2:22:25] enthroned with power and authority
[2:22:27] and conquer every enemy
[2:22:32] now jesus would use this on the
[2:22:34] pharisees
[2:22:36] in matthew 22 verse 41. let's watch
[2:22:39] jesus now
[2:22:40] he uses it you know because they're
[2:22:42] trying to trap
[2:22:43] him up and he said well i got one for
[2:22:45] you
[2:22:47] now you answer you answer me and then
[2:22:50] i'll answer you
[2:22:52] so he says while the pharisees were
[2:22:55] gathered together
[2:22:56] jesus asked him saying what thank you of
[2:22:59] christ
[2:23:01] whose son is he and they said to him the
[2:23:04] son of david
[2:23:05] because that's who they believe the
[2:23:06] messiah would be the one that savior
[2:23:08] that would come he would save them from
[2:23:10] the romans they had it all figured out
[2:23:12] he's going to be the son of david he
[2:23:13] said there's one promise sit on his
[2:23:15] throne
[2:23:16] and he said unto them then how then did
[2:23:18] david
[2:23:19] in the spirit call him lord
[2:23:22] saying the lord said unto my lord
[2:23:25] sit down on my right hand till i make
[2:23:28] thine
[2:23:28] enemies my footstool if david didn't
[2:23:31] call him
[2:23:32] lord how is he his son
[2:23:37] and i said duh
[2:23:41] i don't know and no man was able to
[2:23:44] answer him a word
[2:23:46] neither dost any man from that day forth
[2:23:48] ask him any more questions
[2:23:55] now david called him lord so how is he
[2:23:58] his son
[2:24:00] because he is the root and the offspring
[2:24:04] of david as one born in the tribe of
[2:24:07] judah in the lineage of david
[2:24:09] he is also the root
[2:24:12] in that he is the creator of all things
[2:24:16] so he was the root of david he was the
[2:24:18] creator of the world
[2:24:20] and yet he come and was born in the
[2:24:22] lineage of david in the tribe of judah
[2:24:27] and this is how he was he was the lord
[2:24:30] the creator
[2:24:31] yet david's son because god was made
[2:24:35] flesh and dwelt among
[2:24:37] us now you can't understand that without
[2:24:41] knowing that
[2:24:42] jesus was god manifested in the flesh
[2:24:46] and this is what they didn't want to see
[2:24:49] now david called him lord so how is he
[2:24:51] his son because he's the root and
[2:24:52] offspring
[2:24:53] now acts chapter 2 verse 34. but david
[2:24:56] is
[2:24:57] for david is not ascended into the
[2:24:58] heavens but he said himself
[2:25:00] the lord said to my lord sit thou on my
[2:25:03] right hand so now
[2:25:04] david when he made this prophecy in the
[2:25:06] psalms he wasn't in the heavens
[2:25:08] but he said he said the lord said un
[2:25:12] to my lord sit thou on my right hand
[2:25:15] well then you would have to be in the
[2:25:16] heavens to sit on the right hand of god
[2:25:20] so he said david's not a sin in the
[2:25:21] heavens but he said himself the lord
[2:25:23] said unto
[2:25:24] myself say unto unto my lord
[2:25:27] sit down on my right hand until i make
[2:25:29] thy foes that footstool
[2:25:31] therefore let all the house of israel
[2:25:34] know assuredly
[2:25:35] that the god hath made this same jesus
[2:25:38] whom you have crucified he is both lord
[2:25:42] and christ so when jesus
[2:25:46] rose from the dead come on amen he was
[2:25:50] not only
[2:25:51] he was not only christ the messiah the
[2:25:54] man of the flesh
[2:25:55] but now he's the lord of lord and the
[2:25:57] king of kings
[2:26:00] amen so he was made lord
[2:26:03] ruler of the universe just and hello
[2:26:07] the ruler of the death hell and the
[2:26:09] grave
[2:26:10] and this powerful and majestic lord
[2:26:13] is christ the messiah
[2:26:16] amen hebrews chapter 10 verse 11 every
[2:26:19] priest standeth daily
[2:26:21] ministered in offering sometimes
[2:26:23] oftentimes the same
[2:26:25] sacrifice which can never take away sins
[2:26:28] but this man after he had offered one
[2:26:31] sacrifice
[2:26:32] now here he's going over he said look
[2:26:34] think of the millions of lambs that have
[2:26:36] been slain and none of them could take
[2:26:37] away sin
[2:26:41] but he said but this man this man
[2:26:44] jesus after he'd offered one sacrifice
[2:26:47] for sins
[2:26:49] forever sat down on the right hand of
[2:26:51] god
[2:26:52] from henceforth expect until his enemies
[2:26:55] be made his footstool
[2:26:57] so he said this man offered one
[2:26:59] sacrifice
[2:27:00] and went there and sat in the realm of
[2:27:02] power and authority
[2:27:05] now this right hand of god does not mean
[2:27:07] he's a lesser god
[2:27:08] setting besides a greater god this is
[2:27:11] not two people
[2:27:13] reigning either
[2:27:16] on the throne and the other at his right
[2:27:18] hand first of all
[2:27:19] god is a spirit and he don't have a hand
[2:27:24] god only has a hand when he has a body
[2:27:29] come on somebody
[2:27:31] amen and secondly the right hand means
[2:27:34] it means
[2:27:35] the position of power and authority and
[2:27:37] that simply means that
[2:27:38] this man jesus after he offered one
[2:27:41] sacrifice for sin
[2:27:42] has offered back has entered back into
[2:27:46] the power and authority of being god
[2:27:48] again
[2:27:48] and through this very act of his death
[2:27:50] at calvary everything
[2:27:52] every demon spirit every devil of hell
[2:27:56] ever sin and every sickness will
[2:27:59] eventually
[2:28:00] be fully and totally conquered and ruled
[2:28:03] by him
[2:28:04] he is confident that what he did at
[2:28:07] calvary
[2:28:08] works and that all we gotta do is come
[2:28:10] in his name
[2:28:12] and that name will cast out devils that
[2:28:14] name
[2:28:15] amen will transform lives that name will
[2:28:18] save the violence sinner from sin
[2:28:22] he he has no more work to
[2:28:26] do
[2:28:30] on earth because that one sacrifice will
[2:28:34] defeat
[2:28:34] every devil
[2:28:38] every addiction every drug habit
[2:28:43] every spirit of alcohol every demon of
[2:28:46] hell
[2:28:47] [Applause]
[2:28:51] the revelation of jesus christ in the
[2:28:53] church age book
[2:28:55] yes if there were three gods you might
[2:28:57] very well baptize for father
[2:28:59] son and the holy ghost but the
[2:29:01] revelation given to john was that there
[2:29:03] was one god in his name is the lord
[2:29:05] jesus christ
[2:29:07] and you baptize for one god you baptize
[2:29:09] for one god
[2:29:11] and only one well wait a minute don't
[2:29:14] get on from me for believing in one god
[2:29:21] he said here you baptize for one god
[2:29:26] and only one and that's why peter
[2:29:27] baptized the way he did at pentecost
[2:29:30] he had the true revelation which was let
[2:29:33] the
[2:29:34] all the house of israel know assuredly
[2:29:36] that god had made the same
[2:29:37] jesus whom you crucified both lord and
[2:29:41] christ there
[2:29:41] is the lord jesus christ
[2:29:45] amen and he says if jesus is both lord
[2:29:49] and christ and he
[2:29:50] jesus is and cannot be anything else but
[2:29:54] father son and holy ghost in one person
[2:29:57] manifested in the flesh
[2:29:59] it is not one god in three persons
[2:30:01] blessed trinity
[2:30:03] but one god one person with three major
[2:30:06] titles with three offices manifesting
[2:30:09] those titles
[2:30:10] here once more this same jesus
[2:30:14] is both lord and christ
[2:30:17] lord father i'm still reading
[2:30:20] lord father and christ holy spirit
[2:30:24] are jesus for he jesus is both of them
[2:30:28] lord and christ
[2:30:34] amen put that put that scripture back up
[2:30:37] there that last one
[2:30:38] he had made the same jesus both lord and
[2:30:41] christ now let's read it again
[2:30:44] notice this
[2:30:48] can you find it all right well it was a
[2:30:50] one before
[2:30:52] it was acts chapter 2 verse 36
[2:30:57] amen therefore let all the house of
[2:31:00] israel know
[2:31:01] assuredly that god have made this same
[2:31:04] jesus whom you crucified both
[2:31:07] lord brother branham said that's father
[2:31:11] and christ that's holy ghost
[2:31:19] now ephesians church age he said these
[2:31:23] things which hold at this
[2:31:24] the seven stars in his right hand we
[2:31:26] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[2:31:28] candlestick
[2:31:29] this is he of whom it said the same
[2:31:32] jesus is both
[2:31:33] lord and christ there he is the one
[2:31:36] and only lord god almighty and beside
[2:31:38] him there is no other
[2:31:40] there he is the savior salvation lord
[2:31:43] jonah 2 9 walk in the midst of the
[2:31:45] churches through these seven ages
[2:31:46] what he was in the first age he he is in
[2:31:49] all ages to every believer he is jesus
[2:31:52] christ the same yesterday today and
[2:31:53] forever what he did
[2:31:54] once still do it and we'll keep on doing
[2:31:56] it that's right
[2:31:58] you know again i'm going to come back to
[2:32:00] this because
[2:32:01] i hear it all the time from people you
[2:32:03] don't want to come and say
[2:32:04] you know i heard your oneness i had
[2:32:06] somebody write me the other day from
[2:32:08] australia
[2:32:09] i heard you're a oneness well i do
[2:32:11] believe in one god
[2:32:13] not three and i believe in one lord
[2:32:18] not two and i'm not a oneness
[2:32:22] but i'm not a oneness like the upc and
[2:32:24] to jesus only
[2:32:26] i'm a believer in one god
[2:32:30] and his name is the lord jesus christ
[2:32:34] now in the revelation of jesus christ
[2:32:37] the church's book he said the spirit of
[2:32:39] god
[2:32:40] in john expressly thus expresses dustly
[2:32:44] in one in order to set forth the supreme
[2:32:48] deity of jesus christ and to reveal the
[2:32:51] godhead
[2:32:51] as one god so i don't know how you're
[2:32:54] getting more than one
[2:32:56] so well he ain't one it was god and his
[2:32:59] son jesus and jesus was not god
[2:33:01] now you're heathen now you
[2:33:04] now you've done come back to the place
[2:33:06] where you know anybody
[2:33:08] that that would ever amount to hillary
[2:33:10] beans will believe that jesus
[2:33:12] is the supreme deity
[2:33:16] okay so you say well but brother tim
[2:33:19] jesus
[2:33:20] couldn't be his own father but
[2:33:23] the eternal spirit the father
[2:33:27] created himself a body thus god
[2:33:31] fathered a son and came and dwelt in him
[2:33:36] now god is not one like your finger i'm
[2:33:38] going to go over that again
[2:33:40] neither is he true like two fingers and
[2:33:42] he's certainly not three like three
[2:33:44] fingers
[2:33:46] rather god was in christ reconciling the
[2:33:49] world to himself
[2:33:52] now this is this is really important
[2:33:56] that we under we understand this now
[2:33:57] watch this in discerning the body of the
[2:33:59] lord he said how many knows
[2:34:01] that jesus today is a pillar of fire
[2:34:05] that's the form he's here now in amen
[2:34:08] that followed the children of israel i
[2:34:10] came from god i'd go to god
[2:34:12] i came from that pillar of fire i'm
[2:34:14] returning back to there
[2:34:15] when paul met him on the road to
[2:34:17] damascus what was he
[2:34:18] the great light the bill of fire he's
[2:34:20] the same one today the
[2:34:22] holy spirit of god the body of jesus
[2:34:25] sets at the right hand of god on his
[2:34:27] throne in heaven
[2:34:29] but his spirit is here on the earth and
[2:34:30] completing completing and finishing his
[2:34:33] work now wait a minute
[2:34:36] so he can't be one like your finger
[2:34:39] because his body is there and his spirit
[2:34:42] is here
[2:34:44] and he said that same spirit that lived
[2:34:47] in the body
[2:34:48] of jesus christ was the same spirit that
[2:34:50] was in that angel that came down to
[2:34:52] sodom
[2:34:53] and gomorrah do you believe that
[2:34:56] the same one that followed the children
[2:34:58] of israel so
[2:35:00] again see he's not one like his finger
[2:35:02] he can be in the body of jesus
[2:35:05] upon the throne not comatose
[2:35:09] but ever living to make intercession
[2:35:12] come on and yet the same spirit of
[2:35:16] christ
[2:35:17] be in your heart and still move and blow
[2:35:21] like the rushing mighty wind through the
[2:35:23] church
[2:35:24] or even manifest himself in a pillar of
[2:35:26] fire
[2:35:28] to save jesus because brother branham
[2:35:31] said he's the same in
[2:35:33] every detail but his corporal body
[2:35:35] because he's not here in his corporate
[2:35:37] body
[2:35:38] he's here in the body of his church
[2:35:42] the same pillar of fire so
[2:35:46] what body is jesus in now in revelation
[2:35:50] book of symbols he said in the old
[2:35:52] testament
[2:35:52] he was a pillar of fire that led to
[2:35:54] children of israel that was christ the
[2:35:56] ark
[2:35:56] the angel of the covenant in the old
[2:36:00] in the new testament he manifested
[2:36:02] himself in flesh
[2:36:03] to take away sin to bring us back to
[2:36:05] sons and daughters of god
[2:36:06] one day coming down the road become a
[2:36:09] little sassy jew
[2:36:10] he's going to arrest those people who
[2:36:12] were crying and praising god
[2:36:14] and prophesying and what met him a
[2:36:16] beautiful light
[2:36:18] what body is jesus in now a light
[2:36:23] the same pillar of fire that it was at
[2:36:24] the beginning now we're talking about
[2:36:26] what body is he in now upon the earth
[2:36:32] because we'll meet the corporal body of
[2:36:35] jesus christ in the air
[2:36:38] amen but what body does he appear now in
[2:36:41] in a pillar of fire
[2:36:44] and then each one of us get a lick of
[2:36:46] that pillar of fire
[2:36:48] so he dwells in us too so he can't be
[2:36:51] one like your finger
[2:36:53] you see he you know he is there he's in
[2:36:56] your heart
[2:36:56] he is there in the congregation he's in
[2:36:59] your heart my heart
[2:37:00] everybody around the world at the same
[2:37:02] time come on
[2:37:03] he's not one like your finger and man
[2:37:06] but he is there
[2:37:07] he is one god but he can manifest
[2:37:10] himself
[2:37:10] in the in the in the in the body on the
[2:37:12] throne ever living to make intercession
[2:37:15] there in a pillar of fire discern the
[2:37:17] thoughts and intents of heart heal the
[2:37:19] sick come on
[2:37:20] he can there come transform himself
[2:37:22] right there
[2:37:23] as the angel of the covenant he can come
[2:37:26] right there
[2:37:26] move within your heart he can come and
[2:37:29] move through the church and licks of
[2:37:30] fire
[2:37:31] followed up on 120 in the upper room
[2:37:34] amen he's not one like your finger but
[2:37:36] he's the same god
[2:37:46] now brother bradham tells us
[2:37:50] god told moses i'm going to send an
[2:37:52] angel my angel
[2:37:53] before you to keep you in the way and
[2:37:55] anybody knows
[2:37:56] that angel was jesus christ which was
[2:38:00] the pillar of fire
[2:38:02] it was christ his name wasn't jesus
[2:38:05] yet until he was manifested in the flesh
[2:38:13] you know i was looking just a few
[2:38:15] moments ago for an address
[2:38:18] and somebody on there called one of our
[2:38:21] brothers
[2:38:21] uh a branamite we're not a brand of mite
[2:38:26] we were we're following the pillar of
[2:38:28] fire
[2:38:32] that's what we're following we're
[2:38:35] we're not a little william branham we're
[2:38:37] a follower of jesus christ
[2:38:40] we're a christian you see me are you are
[2:38:43] you with me
[2:38:44] am i here you see as he said his name
[2:38:48] let me let me read it together he said
[2:38:49] i'm going to send an angel before you to
[2:38:51] keep you in a way that anyone knows that
[2:38:53] angel was jesus christ which was a bill
[2:38:56] of our it was
[2:38:57] christ his name wasn't
[2:39:00] jesus yet until
[2:39:04] he was manifested in flesh
[2:39:07] and there you shall call his name jesus
[2:39:11] yeshua amen
[2:39:15] because he will save his people from
[2:39:17] their sins
[2:39:19] are you with me now so you see this is
[2:39:22] where he would come
[2:39:23] in the last as he approached in the last
[2:39:26] church age and he said
[2:39:27] i'm going to do something i'm going to
[2:39:28] set before you an open door and he's
[2:39:30] talking about it in the philadelphian
[2:39:32] age
[2:39:33] and he's telling there's a revelation
[2:39:34] coming that's just going to open the
[2:39:36] door to the rest of the scripture
[2:39:40] and he said what was that open door he
[2:39:42] said it was a revelation
[2:39:44] of the supreme deity of jesus christ not
[2:39:47] being a second person of a trinity
[2:39:49] but being god himself made flesh and
[2:39:51] dwelling among us
[2:39:53] so god would be given an open door don't
[2:39:56] try to close the door and make two lords
[2:39:59] or three gods or whatever else come on
[2:40:02] now church
[2:40:03] amen we gotta we gotta keep it right
[2:40:05] because it's a revelation when you
[2:40:08] know who jesus is then you know who you
[2:40:11] are amen and if you can be assured
[2:40:14] that this jesus that we are servant
[2:40:16] today
[2:40:17] he was in a pillar of fire discerning
[2:40:20] the thoughts and end thoughts of a heart
[2:40:21] he was so light that appeared on the
[2:40:23] road to damascus
[2:40:24] he was the one who dwelt in jesus christ
[2:40:27] he was the one that appeared to moses
[2:40:30] he was the one that created the heavens
[2:40:32] and the earth
[2:40:33] amen he is that same god and whatever he
[2:40:36] did then
[2:40:37] he's that same god that i moved today if
[2:40:40] he healed the sick then
[2:40:41] he'll heal the sick now if he raised the
[2:40:44] dead dead he'll raise the dead now
[2:40:48] cause he's the same god
[2:40:49] [Applause]
[2:40:54] and he's both lord and
[2:40:57] christ lord jesus
[2:41:00] christ father son
[2:41:04] holy ghost same god in his fatherhood
[2:41:08] his sonship and in his spirit
[2:41:10] [Music]
[2:41:14] this open door now what is that open
[2:41:16] door he said it's what is it but a
[2:41:17] revelation of him
[2:41:18] that revelation is opening up to bring
[2:41:21] us strength
[2:41:23] so brother tim you know you're you're
[2:41:25] really preaching elementary this is to
[2:41:27] give you strength
[2:41:29] amen to illuminate the word and glorify
[2:41:32] his name now you can see the same god
[2:41:34] working all the way through and he's
[2:41:36] here right now
[2:41:38] finishing up redemption oh hallelujah
[2:41:42] oh i'm so glad we don't have seven more
[2:41:44] ages to go
[2:41:45] i'm so glad we ain't got 2 000 more
[2:41:48] years to travel
[2:41:49] this journey i'm so glad we have reached
[2:41:51] the end
[2:41:52] i'm so glad we can see the manifestation
[2:41:55] of god in this hour
[2:41:57] bringing in the word that brought us
[2:41:59] hallelujah that our
[2:42:00] message is based on the saint the lord
[2:42:03] a man from the angel of god himself
[2:42:12] yes we knew him was god
[2:42:16] how else could he be our savior but to
[2:42:18] know he was
[2:42:19] only god or god alone
[2:42:23] that he is both he is alpha and omega
[2:42:25] that he's both
[2:42:27] jesus both lord in christ making him
[2:42:29] lord jesus christ the father son the
[2:42:31] holy ghost
[2:42:32] all one person and that has been lost
[2:42:35] since the first
[2:42:36] ages and but first church ages but now
[2:42:38] we are seeing it again
[2:42:40] the revelation of who he was has come
[2:42:43] back
[2:42:44] amen amen you want to take the power out
[2:42:47] of the church
[2:42:48] let a theologian mess it up
[2:42:51] amen they'll take it there until they
[2:42:53] ain't even an amen anymore they ain't
[2:42:55] even a hallelujah anymore
[2:42:57] they ain't even a movement of the spirit
[2:42:58] anymore it's as dead as
[2:43:01] as a roman catholic church you might as
[2:43:04] well have a priest coming down with a
[2:43:05] lantern sprinkling
[2:43:07] incense everywhere and it's the same old
[2:43:09] hedonism that there ever was
[2:43:11] but god is establishing a church of
[2:43:14] death saith the lord but by divine
[2:43:17] vindication
[2:43:18] showing it over and over and over and
[2:43:20] over
[2:43:24] and this angel never leaves us
[2:43:28] this angel encamps about us
[2:43:32] this angel won't leave you in your sins
[2:43:35] going to save you from your sins this
[2:43:38] angel won't leave you alone
[2:43:41] come on amen you might be way
[2:43:44] down deep in sin amen you might be like
[2:43:47] this brother that's going to be
[2:43:48] baptized you've never known jesus but i
[2:43:51] tell you
[2:43:52] it doesn't matter whether you ever knew
[2:43:54] him or not he knew you
[2:43:56] before the foundational world and he
[2:43:58] called you
[2:43:59] and he kept dealing with your heart and
[2:44:01] dealing with your heart
[2:44:02] and dealing with your heart amen
[2:44:13] i created you for fellowship
[2:44:16] i'm taking a people for my namesake
[2:44:19] and it's like a bride and a groom
[2:44:22] because physically we're not women
[2:44:25] but the church is he's the head of it
[2:44:28] and she's the body
[2:44:29] so it's like a bride and a groom so
[2:44:32] she's the bride
[2:44:33] and she's being married to the groom
[2:44:36] she's becoming one
[2:44:37] she's taken on his name she's been
[2:44:40] identified with him she has been changed
[2:44:45] there's a change transforms i always
[2:44:49] marvel you know when a bride and groom
[2:44:50] to come together they actually both
[2:44:52] change that's right you'll see them both
[2:44:54] change they'll just
[2:44:55] you know this boy may be this way and
[2:44:58] this girl that way and
[2:44:59] maybe they come from two different
[2:45:01] houses and they have different thoughts
[2:45:03] and
[2:45:03] what if they come to get married when
[2:45:05] they come along you'll see them once
[2:45:07] become one
[2:45:09] they're not just they're not two anymore
[2:45:11] they're one
[2:45:13] and they think alike and they believe
[2:45:15] alike and they're working together
[2:45:18] that's what oneness is are you with me
[2:45:21] amen but in this deal amen god
[2:45:24] is bringing us back to our original
[2:45:28] the way we were in his mind before the
[2:45:31] world began
[2:45:32] and so we come and unite with him and it
[2:45:35] isn't that he changes
[2:45:37] is that we change as we behold his image
[2:45:42] and we are transformed from glory to
[2:45:44] glory
[2:45:45] as we look into the word we are
[2:45:48] transformed in that same image
[2:45:50] of the word until us
[2:45:53] and the word becomes the same
[2:45:57] what you read on the paper becomes flesh
[2:46:03] [Applause]
[2:46:08] hallelujah
[2:46:10] i believe that's exactly what god's
[2:46:12] doing in this day he has taken the word
[2:46:15] that was on paper and making it flesh
[2:46:18] where people will be called for his
[2:46:20] namesake
[2:46:22] amen the revelation of godhead is back
[2:46:26] now the true church can build in
[2:46:28] strength again after all this time she
[2:46:30] finally knows who her lord is unless
[2:46:33] some theologian messes with her
[2:46:35] and all after all this time she knows
[2:46:37] who our lord is
[2:46:38] once again we're baptized in the name of
[2:46:40] the lord jesus just as he did at
[2:46:42] pentecost
[2:46:43] now i'm trying to get you to see who
[2:46:46] this is that has revealed the word in
[2:46:48] this day
[2:46:50] this message is a revelation
[2:46:53] of himself the pillar of fire that was
[2:46:57] discerning the hearts
[2:46:58] and revealing the mysteries is none
[2:47:01] other
[2:47:03] than the creator himself
[2:47:09] that's why in the prayer line
[2:47:13] a young boy walks up to brother branham
[2:47:16] and he's blind and he has no eyes
[2:47:26] and he asked him what color would you
[2:47:29] like your eyes to be
[2:47:31] a blind boy has never seen no color
[2:47:35] he's only heard of blues and pinks and
[2:47:38] reds and whatever
[2:47:40] and he says blue
[2:47:46] and they pray and formed in his sockets
[2:47:51] comes the prettiest set of blue eyes
[2:47:53] that you would ever see
[2:47:56] these things are not fixing
[2:47:59] they happened
[2:48:04] and that god is still just as real of
[2:48:07] god today
[2:48:08] [Music]
[2:48:11] who can take a little woman and
[2:48:14] one moment black with cancer the next
[2:48:18] moment
[2:48:18] clean
[2:48:22] he's the same god that can take a soul
[2:48:25] that is black with sin
[2:48:28] and in one moment turn it and cleanse it
[2:48:32] and make it white as snow
[2:48:38] this is the creator yes it is the
[2:48:42] creator
[2:48:45] let the musicians come
[2:48:51] what is it we're following
[2:48:57] who is it we're following who was it
[2:49:01] that revealed itself
[2:49:04] the man i knew is william branham when i
[2:49:07] sat
[2:49:08] how old are you 13.
[2:49:12] i was two years younger than you and i
[2:49:16] sat
[2:49:16] maybe that far away maybe about like
[2:49:19] william was
[2:49:24] right over on the wing right on the way
[2:49:28] my family sat right over there
[2:49:32] and this man talked about an angel
[2:49:37] i never saw the angel i didn't see the
[2:49:40] fire but i saw the effects
[2:49:46] i saw hearts discerned
[2:49:49] i saw things that man couldn't know
[2:49:54] unless some being was talking to him
[2:50:00] and that being go back 40 years in the
[2:50:04] life
[2:50:05] and tell him i saw you he was a little
[2:50:08] girl
[2:50:10] this is how you was dressed a pencil
[2:50:13] flew up no it was a pen
[2:50:16] it hit you in the eye
[2:50:20] it blinded your eye that was me
[2:50:24] oh i see you now about
[2:50:27] 16. you're running you're dressed in a
[2:50:30] checkered dress you've got braids
[2:50:37] it's a yellow dog that's chasing you
[2:50:41] oh now i see you an older woman
[2:50:46] you're coming up the steps there's a red
[2:50:49] barn you're coming from
[2:50:50] that barn you're walking down
[2:50:54] and now you're coming and as you come up
[2:50:56] the steps
[2:50:58] you're leaning over sideways
[2:51:07] and you said if i can ever get to
[2:51:10] brother branham
[2:51:15] i'll be healed
[2:51:20] who told him all of that
[2:51:44] now
[2:51:49] i was going to baptize
[2:51:54] brother james here james lingle strong
[2:52:00] somebody asked me what his name was
[2:52:03] he said lingo let's find out his name
[2:52:06] what's his last name
[2:52:10] if i would have guessed
[2:52:14] ain't no telling what i would have
[2:52:16] guessed i couldn't have made a
[2:52:19] if i just stood here the rest of my life
[2:52:22] i probably wouldn't ever get it
[2:52:27] i mean james is a bible name so that'd
[2:52:29] be pretty easy to get
[2:52:31] after maybe 100 or so guesses
[2:52:35] maybe less i might have got james
[2:52:41] the strom
[2:52:45] i'd have never got that
[2:52:50] i'd be here the rest of my life but god
[2:52:54] knows
[2:52:57] he said about you before
[2:53:02] you were formed in your mother's womb i
[2:53:04] knew you and i ordained you
[2:53:13] there's a book
[2:53:16] symbolic perhaps it's a symbolic book
[2:53:20] but it's a book
[2:53:23] and there were names that were written
[2:53:25] in there
[2:53:27] before the foundation of the world
[2:53:31] god knew you were coming
[2:53:34] he knows everyone that he is
[2:53:39] he knows exactly where to find you and
[2:53:41] how to find you
[2:53:44] he'll find some down in the gutters of
[2:53:46] sin
[2:53:47] he'll find some in halls of education
[2:53:52] mean just recently there was a you know
[2:53:56] i was supposed to go to japan
[2:53:59] minister and you know what happened kobe
[2:54:01] struck and i couldn't go
[2:54:03] things happened blocked the plans the

[2:56:19] yesterday
[2:56:21] we had on a plate
[2:56:25] i had cooked cabbage a salad
[2:56:29] dressing tomatoes in that
[2:56:38] lettuce
[2:56:40] i had fish blackened fish that had
[2:56:44] prepared on the stove
[2:56:48] i had all that laying before me a sweet
[2:56:52] potato
[2:56:54] i picked it up i said look at this leaf
[2:56:59] we're just talking we're just
[2:57:00] fellowshipping i'll pick up a leaf of a
[2:57:02] cabbage
[2:57:04] i said where did it come from
[2:57:08] i said now look over here look how
[2:57:10] different this is and i pick up
[2:57:12] her potato peel because i eat all of
[2:57:14] mine
[2:57:16] and i said where did this come from
[2:57:20] it's all together different from this
[2:57:21] cabbage
[2:57:24] i said look right there look over here
[2:57:28] you got beans on your plate too i said
[2:57:30] where'd they come from
[2:57:32] they're all together different i said
[2:57:35] did they just happen
[2:57:36] there did they just accidentally get on
[2:57:39] this plate
[2:57:42] that they we just you know they just
[2:57:44] something grew in the world and they
[2:57:46] just
[2:57:46] feared out of nothing
[2:57:51] i said look at you how different you are
[2:57:54] from this cabbage
[2:57:58] where did you come from
[2:58:01] you're so different from this cabbage
[2:58:03] and this
[2:58:07] these beans i said she
[2:58:10] shows us a designer
[2:58:14] as a creator amen i said now they want
[2:58:16] us to believe it's just two acids
[2:58:18] rubbing together
[2:58:21] but i said look here i have on my arm
[2:58:27] an apple watch
[2:58:31] have that get there
[2:58:34] i said how many millions of years would
[2:58:36] it take for two acids
[2:58:38] rubbing together to become this watch in
[2:58:41] my arm
[2:58:44] it's made out of some kind of plastic
[2:58:46] material here and
[2:58:48] some glass there and some parts in there
[2:58:50] that i don't know what is and
[2:58:52] everything some metal there on the wine
[2:58:55] stem and this and that
[2:58:57] where how how many years would it take
[2:59:01] for it just to come and now
[2:59:05] i can pick it up as a watch
[2:59:08] one billion years later it all came
[2:59:11] together
[2:59:13] and now here it is
[2:59:16] all of them and what's in my arm
[2:59:20] no i said there was a master designer
[2:59:26] there was a designer that said i want to
[2:59:28] watch and i want it like this and this
[2:59:30] and he designs and he figures and
[2:59:32] he comes and he gets the components he
[2:59:33] puts it all together
[2:59:35] it was a plan
[2:59:38] but i said where did he get all of that
[2:59:40] from
[2:59:42] he got that from the designer who made
[2:59:44] it all
[2:59:47] this is not an accident and you're not
[2:59:49] an accident
[2:59:50] and we're not just here by chance we're
[2:59:52] here by supreme design
[2:59:57] and god has called you
[3:00:00] for a purpose you're not without a
[3:00:02] purpose you're here for a reason
[3:00:05] the sooner you find that purpose the
[3:00:08] happier you're going to be
[3:00:10] because the devil wants to pervert you
[3:00:12] to his own purpose
[3:00:14] but god wants to transform you back into
[3:00:16] the image
[3:00:17] that he had of you before the world
[3:00:22] began
[3:00:27] let's buy our heads let's just talk to
[3:00:31] him just for a moment maybe you're here
[3:00:33] today and you just realize
[3:00:36] i really need a really a closer walk
[3:00:40] with that god i
[3:00:41] really do i want to come to know him
[3:00:44] more than what i've known him
[3:00:46] i need a deeper revelation of him
[3:00:49] and i just pray he'll make himself known
[3:00:52] to me he showed me that he cared
[3:00:55] he showed me he cares and he loves me so
[3:00:57] much
[3:00:58] that he came to earth to die in my place
[3:01:03] my lord will you just show me how to
[3:01:05] serve you

[3:18:44] when john was baptizing in the river
[3:18:46] jordan
[3:18:48] and jesus came to him to be baptized in
[3:18:52] the water
[3:18:53] that's where every son of god must come
[3:18:56] he must come to the word
[3:18:58] the word must come to the prophet as it
[3:19:01] was and we've been a part of god before
[3:19:03] the world
[3:19:04] began we are part of the great plan of
[3:19:07] god therefore
[3:19:08] the bride is the word of god chuck
[3:19:10] always comes to the prophet
[3:19:12] in the water and here this brother comes
[3:19:16] as jesus did many years ago
[3:19:19] and john had been preaching and saying
[3:19:23] you know there's i baptize with water
[3:19:26] but there's one that's coming after me
[3:19:28] that will baptize you
[3:19:30] with the holy ghost and with fire
[3:19:34] and of course that's where every
[3:19:36] baptizer stands
[3:19:38] he cannot give the holy ghost but
[3:19:41] there's one that comes after him after
[3:19:44] we obey the word
[3:19:45] after we do what god's word said then
[3:19:47] the holy spirit will come back and
[3:19:50] confirm it when a person truly repents
[3:19:54] and is baptized in his name god is
[3:19:57] obligated to give them
[3:19:58] the baptism of the holy ghost may the
[3:20:02] dub
[3:20:02] came to come today upon upon this
[3:20:05] brother
[3:20:06] who i come to baptize in his name
[3:20:09] the lord jesus having sent me in the
[3:20:11] world to preach the gospel
[3:20:14] he commissioned us to baptize those that
[3:20:16] believe
[3:20:18] in the name of the father and of the son
[3:20:19] and the holy ghost
[3:20:21] in obedience to that divine command
