children for those around us Lord and those you've invited Lord to come and be part of this great feast this love feast Lord would you come tonight and strengthen us on the Sunday night it's unusual there would be a Sunday night service like this and but we've dedicated it for the Assembly for the young people and the workers looking forward to Easter camp pray that you would speak things to prepare our hearts and Lord we believe we are part of a great field Lord you're bringing forth fruit climax our lives by the Holy Ghost Lord Jesus may you give us strength tonight and throughout the day as some of tarried and stayed over I pray that you prosper them and give them inspiration Lord and may they go home tonight saying it was good it was worth it to be in the house of God strengthen the assembly Jesus name Amen amen let's turn to the scripture and Luke chapter 10 I'm gonna go right to the word Luke chapter 10 and then we'll just read a quote after you have your seats just for a moment but Luke chapter 10 verse 29 this is kind of a pre camp service is that okay and this is a preparation for us young people older ones and so it's good for us to prepare you actually get more out of something when you prepare so it's not just the you know Tuesday night before Wednesday night before throw in your sleeping bag in your toothbrush and your Bible saying we're going to camp no it said in yourself aside and preparing you'll find out that your fruit is greater the victories are greater and you get more from it so let's approach it as Luke chapter 10 verse 29 speaking about a man that came to Jesus and said who is my neighbor and Jesus answering said a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a Levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him so he didn't just look at him and too busy didn't just look on the situation but his heart was moved into action and he bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the morrow when he departed and took out two pence and gave them to the host he said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again I will repay thee which now of these three thinkest thou was a neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves and he said he that show us mercy on him then said Jesus unto Him go and do thou likewise in other words you've seen oil and wine in a situation now it's time for you to go and do likewise god bless you can have your seats tonight and we speak I'll just give a little foundation for tonight service for a little bit we moved to Cloverdale when I was 16 years old with my mother and my two sisters and my father stayed in Jeffersonville working doing the editing of the messages of brother Branham because there was a burden for the children and the young people to be in a good church and as the years went by and we married and and had our first son and we moved back to Indiana to help my father had begun a little Church there then we a pastored in Tennessee for three years just as a young man and then went on to Arizona to help in a church there for three years and then in 2000 we moved back to Cloverdale all really for a reason for our family to be raised in a church that we had confidence in and that the Lord can minister to my children and my young people and to my wife and I it wasn't a ministry decision it was a decision for my family and I'll say after all these years 19-year years looking back and all three of my children being part of your East Camp and Labor's that goes into that camp and the young people and the ministry I can say tonight our families a product of those kind of meetings and I think you'd say the same that you saw oil and wine poured into the situation in your lives and that's why we are the way we are tonight is because somebody poured in wine and they pour it in oil when Satan wanted to rip us up and tear us apart and tonight we stand with all of our children serving God are their spouses serving the Lord we're now grandparents again if you can believe it and being back in Cloverdale we've helped our assembly with the young people and with the mini camps we have a summer camp that we have each year then we have a winter camp that is just for our young people alone and that's usually in February March and it's a winter camp because we have so many of our own young people we just dedicate that and brother Timothy Pruett is spoken at that before and other ministers of the gospel and we appreciate those times we've just gone through a winter camp at our church and over the years it's it's been a privilege of ours to work with the young people of the message and ministered either camps around the world and been part of families and situations as young people go through times like that so coming here this weekend it was a an opportunity possibly to speak from our hearts before your camp services and to just show the success of the Word of God and the wine and the oil that's poured into a situation and how young people when they have wine which you know from the third seal the Bible says hurt not the oil and the wine and the oil is the Holy Ghost a type of the Holy Ghost and wine a stimulation that comes from the word and so sensitive time of a person's life it's very important to have the right word and the right atmosphere to be poured in or it can be devastating for their future and tonight I want to speak a message and in just preparation with you for your Easter youth camp that has not become just a local meeting but it's become globally as I said this morning were young people and families and even pastors have the confidence to send their young people under your care because they've seen the atmosphere of oil and the Holy Ghost and the wine flows freely it's not cold and it's not the programs and it's not for the gangs and it's not for boy-girl things but it's for an atmosphere for there to be new bursts it's an atmosphere for your young people and then you invite other young people to come to be in your cabins and you have the Gator Patrol and you have the internet and the streaming you have the ministers it's you have the brothers and sisters of your church throwing in your efforts together and I want to say God bless you for that thank you for the 30 plus years that you've given up your Easter weekend because you've invested into the souls of young people in the message and I'll say now for you on this side but on the other side there will be thousands of lives that will come to you and say thank you for giving of yourself like we read in the Bible about this man that had been stripped and wounded and felling among thieves there's young people that have come to these services that have been influenced by your sacrifices and if you look sister Aimee can you bring up our slides and go to the second slides up I'll just go to the second one and look in verse 33 where the Samaritan had compassion so she saw the need but he was willing to do something about it then in verse 34 he did what the Levite and what the priest did not do they saw the need they saw the situation but this man actually did something about and you have done something about it this man went to this person bound up their wounds poured in oil poured in wine set him up on his own Beast which in the Bible a beast is an anointing and brought him to an inn and brother Branham so many times said the inn is a type of the church he brought him into a place that he could be healed and took care of him I thank God for evening like Tabernacle that has been a place like a harbor for people that have come to over the years and it seems like this Easter youth camp is really an opportunity for you to really put yourself into action for the sake of many many that have experienced God because you provided oil and you've provided wine now brother Branham talked about something I like to read this quote with you out of what is that in your hand he said Moses had been a total failure and there may be men here this afternoon may be ministers that's been total failures maybe you've been as a housewife maybe you've been as a student at school and maybe you've been as a child to your parents whatever you have been let that be has-been and start from today amen whatever you have been let that be has been and start from today amen no matter what it is maybe you've been a failure as a Christian maybe you failed to go on with God if it's been taken note to what I'm going to say just in a few moments about this Moses failed down in Egypt when he was born to be a deliverer to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt why because he did it in himself he took it upon himself to do it and anytime you take things upon yourself and leave God out then you're going to be a failure like Moses was but can I say tonight when you surrender your life to Christ and God flows through your life it's gonna be a success even if your past has been a failure it's time for all of us to let our past be the husband and we literally need to turn from that and look in another direction and start moving forward now let's stop the approach like maybe some have on the Monday and Tuesday of camp and say oh god we got to go to camp we got to get ready it's time that we prepare ourselves that we look on the situation and then begin to move out as this man did in the scripture now but the Brenham said I'm going back to our opening scripture he said Jesus found a man one time in a parable was on his road from Jerusalem to Jericho it showed she was backsliding he was going from a high going down low he was backsliding and he met him on the road and an enemy had beaten him robbed him and left him half dead that was physically alive but spiritually dead so the priests and the Levites and so forth pass by him but the Good Samaritan as Jesus taught it came picked him up poured oil in and wine and took him to the end now would you agree tonight he had to have wine and oil himself to give it out would you agree with that I felt this afternoon to say something here tonight for whoever it's for I've noticed people over the years that that's like they always live on the edge spiritually they're always struggling with being justified and sanctified and do I have the Holy Ghost they're always struggling to do the minimum and it's time for for that to be the pass it's time now when God really firmly plants you with the real experience for you to say what can I do for God what does God want to do through my life and stop allowing your experience to say Oh God and what was me and I'm always living kind of you know on the edge and I always need every camp and every week like to feel like I need to repent and come back there has to be a ton spiritually that we really nail it down and say god I don't want that no more I want that experience where you can use me you can flow through as brother Timothy lettuce in that song take my hands Lord take my youth Lord take our family Lord in this case take our church God but it takes men and women of vision that are willing to stop thinking that you're just on the back side and realize you're on the front line God's called you for a purpose God saved you for a purpose he wants to feel you and use you companies ever felt this little in your life just like you are just so small how what can God do with me well our little in the hands of God can feed the multitude like the little boy in his lunch if he would have just kept his little loaves & Fishes and whatever that was and his day and went to school he probably would have ate it up and he just would have went on in school but that little boy in the hands of Jesus his little said mm and I wonder how many of us hold in our little complexes and our little lies when really if it was given to God fully how many hundreds and thousands it would bless I want to say tonight we have been impacted by the wine and oil now what are we gonna do about it we're not called to just sit on the Pew we're not called just to go up and down all the time and our spiritual lives isn't always on the mountain the fruit is growing in the valley so we're in the mountaintop I believe it's been said before you're either in a trial coming out of a trial or getting ready to go in a try but we need to stop wearing that on our faces and on our shoulders so much being a Christian is the greatest life there is I think it was David said I'd rather I'd rather live a day in my courts than a thousands with the wicked a thousand that's almost three years I'd rather live one day in the presence of God hello everyone 365 in about three years I'd rather be in God's presence for one day than to be with the wicked for three years and on one place I'm just paraphrasing but brother branham said you know Israel had their hind your parts every Church has their hunger parts every family has their hind parts every ministry has their kinder parts every sister every brother has their hunger parts but God didn't raise you up to just use your hind ur parts he has a gift in your life and the oil and the wine was for you to be used of God to move the body forward [Applause] so can evening light Tabernacle take this service tonight and approach this year differently than other years and say God you gave us wine and you gave us oil but we show our love to God by what we do for others I want you to use our lives this year greater than ever for to be sensitive and give wine and give oil to someone else now brother Branham talked about how this man poured in wine and oil and he said there's the place I want to get you to he taking him to the end and said to the caretaker take care of him he give him a couple of pennies or whatever it was to pay his way he said now if he needs any more just go ahead and take care of him I'll make it right when I come now you Shepherds brother branham said speaking to the ministry God gives you the spirit and the word to take care of these wounded ones that's been brought in if you need any more he'll take care of that when he comes so just feed those sheep how many want to be good tech caretakers God's giving you wine and giving you all it's not just for us to you know just have an excitement ourselves the Monday after camp same I wasn't those great meetings or man I'm so tired or oh my we got to go back now God brings us to these mountaintops and to these sacred sands he's even preaching this message tonight and maybe even a special speaker to let you know that we can come into these times and go through them and come on the other side God can use you greater than ever before you know I feel like I'm speaking like to the championship team in a locker room you say we've won so many times brother John we've went to camps and we've had meetings and we've had services and we've had this we're just going to go in but you know any winning coach isn't just always satisfied with how it's been it's like in our blood it's like in our services it's like in our singing it's like in our preaching it's like I believe there's more titles for us there's more souls to be saved if we're not careful we get in a rut and say oh wow we don't need to do that brother John we bring the wires we bring our sleeping bag we're going to another camp it's gonna be this way Thursday night it's going to be this way Friday Saturday on Saturday nights gonna be this and we're gonna have baptism sunny Maury we're all going to be tired and I hope nobody's throwing oranges and drinking coffee on Sunday morning like there was a few years ago and all all the things that have gone on and you remember is that true and it's like as time goes on we start weighing things oh that was a ten that was a five oh that's an eight well that was a dud or I'm tired or you know that certain preacher you know I don't really get much out of their ministry oh no here we go again it's that person sing in it and we need to move out of that mindset we need to move out of that way of thinking and we need to say God I've been impacted by the wine and oil I'm gonna come into the same God I'm gonna be more sensitive this year do you want to use us so rather than going in backslidden and away from God why don't we go into it with our hearts ready to go preparing our hearts I wrote something in my notes to say after this morning service sometimes God may choose to make your testimony public and to make it a great testimony and make it that's where you're almost embarrassed to say well a lot of people know he makes your testimony public but she may allow your private life to experience a lot of pain and a lot of suffering and a lot of turmoil I said that to help some of you to let you know God may use your sickness or your family trouble or a certain thing you're going through and and make it a great testimony and why do they call my name or why does it seem like this is happening to me my meat is so public do you remember brother Branham sometimes he would talk to people and talk to them about personal things in their lives I do have to say it so publicly it's like the whole world knows I've got this issue or you know you've got a problem with smoking or you've got breast cancer or you're nervous is that right and I see this thing it's like stop it stop being so public about my private life but little do we know God has brought your life to the public but many times we don't know in our private life there's a lot of pain there's a lot of suffering people do not know what people that have great testimonies endure in their private life some of you might think this is a very skim milk service it's actually much deeper than you think there's great testimonies and miracles and things that God has done but the Monday and the Tuesday and what God brings that man or that woman through a lot of suffering a lot of pain I have prayed with ministers wives and older sisters in their 50s and 60s wondering if they've got the Holy Ghost and wondering if they where they stand with God and it's like it's not a young people's issue it's across the board God could use a person mightily like Jonah and then he can use like Elijah mightily and then them go into such a depression where the Branham can be used to the thousands and ministered to the thousands and there and then go through a thing in his own private life and personal life make it so public and humiliate the man and I'm sure some of you've gone through that but I thank God for the wine and the oil let's go to revelations chapter 6 now verse five and six how many's been impacted by the wine and oil hallelujah we've all been thrown to the side or hurt over the years there's always no matter our lives are so like a fish bowl out there that it's like people say things they do things and they email things and text things they might make a website about you but it's time that we haven't enough character and enough something about ourselves where we just keep serving God anyway hallelujah whether we be young people or moms and dads it it's so easy to get weary in well-doing and and bear your cross so much to where someone else might say I don't even know how they're standing but you know it's God that keeps us standing it's because God gives us oil in the Book of Revelations chapter 6 verse 5 and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see and I beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts lion ox man and Eagle brother branham talked about this in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny brother branham stops and says see they were charging for the word they were charging for the word for the meal for the food that the people should have been getting they were charging for it do you know there's going to be young people come to this camp that come from different churches that don't have what you have and they might be a camper or even a counselor or someone that comes to the services their normal church life is imbalanced they're not balanced you feel come uncomfortable around them you you feel uneasy you'd say they got issues they got issues but do you know what we all had issues we all were hurt and it's gonna take an extra measure of grace to be staying focused and say God you provided for us through the year I come from a good church I have good ministry then that should be able to put something in you to give to others so we need to stop our laughing and joking are sane man they got issues man they're full of themselves and instead of just turning it around and saying god help me this year to have the right attitude if you go into it with wine and oil you have something to give you're able to bear along with someone you're able to understand I hope this is helping somebody in verse 6 we find a measure of wheat for penny three measures of barley for a penny colon or semicolon whatever that is and see thou hurt not the oil and wine that's a commandment you can take everything take their health their wealth but you can't take the oil Holy Ghost and you can't take the wine no matter how far a person gets down and low when they start hearing the word they're gonna respond some jump some scream some just sit there and cry I'm preparing you for camp some don't know what to do they look at one another and say how should I be responding to this some are jumping up and down summer running to the altar some are screaming and some are you know look at what's going on no it's time that we begin to understand it's a hospital people need help churches a hospital and what really turns you on another person it might not be ministering to their need wine and oil is for the need as the Bible says if you have no need of a physician than when a physician you might not need that physician but you get in a 9-1-1 crisis you need a doctor you need someone to be saying that say why over the last years has there been ministers talk about pornography when 20 years ago you would have had to look that up on google what does it even mean is that true why is he talking about the internet why is there certain ministers that talk about you know chatting and Instagram and Facebook and they just bring it right down to whatsapp and right down to music and all of that and it seems like other ministers just preach on them revelations and just keep us in the seals brother and just keep us on the Rainbows you know we like to go into those meetings like they're pumping I'm full of and then they leave it's just they're high but what I found out over the years if you don't have a ministry that works with the people where they're at and to the young people you find the young people go through these experiences and they become tip Brown stars brother branham set camp Brown stars that is when the campgrounds on their on brother their a man a man and then through the year they go right back to being duds no response won't do anything for God two months go by they're right back into their hole and you say where was their camp they were so on fire brother branham called him campground stars I call them revival surfers they're just looking for the next wave they're looking for the next revival on high man they're on they're on but when you go in the valley Slayer friends it's time that we mature to the place as believers that their seasons in our lives hallelujah we've been impacted by the wine and oil it's like God was saying you know what I've always got to have the oil and I've always got to have wine there let me take you to this next slide sister Amy's gonna help us here as we speak about the oil and the wine how many would agree that wine has come to you please pass the wine and I'm not talking about wine and alcohol I'm talking about stimulation that comes from real revelation we just came from our winter camp these are three photos of our campground brother Tim Pruitt the Lord willing we'll be there in a few weeks for the Timothy's been there for winter camp this is what it looks like in the wintertime why came to us oil has come to us right at the very time that we needed it God provided it but I want to say this this is really the heart of tonight's message if we've received wine and oil then we become responsible too an atmosphere for others we can't just be going through this ups and downs and campground stars and revival surfers with when God is saying no you're responsible to have it for somebody else remember the Levite didn't have time the the priest didn't have time it was a Samaritan that with compassion you know sometimes we're just too busy hello somebody where one thing about camp is we all slow down it's like we're there for a cause for a purpose God brings our focus down we are here for souls it's not the food it's the spiritual part it's not just holding a twig in between us and relationships I've heard people say the oh they just come to camp 4 to get a boyfriend or get a wife or I think that's nonsense that might be a fringe benefit and if it happens praise the Lord I'd rather them be at camp than in some honky-tonk can you say man you say you know our principal of our church school saw his wife sister Shelly at your camp so you were partially guilty of a good marriage and a brother and his wife that's given 10 years for our assembly and for our church school I'm looking at people that gave up your Easter Sunday's for that I know of preachers in the message that receive the Holy Ghost at these meetings would you say it's worth it is it worth it but how many times have you done it and then you just wonder you know I asked brother William last night Dexter about this brother William you might remember this how many times does the average human heart beat in a lifetime do you remember that brother William yes and you know what Williams said to me he said well beats more when I play soccer yeah that's nothing but the truth brother brother John's heart beats more when I'm on the treadmill and I'm running running it goes up to 140 Plus but do you know the average human heart in a lifetime how many times it beats I'm staying on my message the average person's heart beats 60 to 100 beats a minute over a hundred thousand times a year over thirty five million times a year thank you over 100,000 times a day over 35 million times a year in 70 years 2.45 billion look at that if you live longer up to 80 years 2.8 billion times that your heart beats now it's a sign of a heart condition I'm not giving you a science lesson I'm just letting you know God is concerned with your heart beating but it's a sign of a heart condition if the heart misses beats or beats too fast that's why it's important that we stay and beat with God's Word now I'm coming back to our preparation for Easter camp just because it's done it before does not take away from the importance that it must keep beating it's got to keep beating say but I beat before you say I've done this before I've done this a hundred thousand times a day I've done this 35 million times how many times do we need to have camp and why do we need Sunday school why do we need Wednesday why do we need Sunday why why why why here's the answer just because it happened before don't mean it needs to happen again I thought there'd be a better response than that that's why we have youth camp and I trust it goes on to the rapture cuz every day every year there's another generation rising up rising up and they deserve to meet the same God you did hallelujah say I've done that before brother Baxter I mean how many times is the Gator but you have to take our 4-wheelers how many times do we need to have this big meat and why why why we can get to a place that the older ones can say come on wait we've been 30-plus years without even an Easter service at our church why why why and if we're not careful we can make it a negative and send praise the Lord we have seven eight hundred people join us for Easter and now the world knows about it now it's become a standard around the world where they say Louisiana camp is a place where young people can meet with God it's not seminar style teaching it's not just talking about relationships we're not just dealing with money issues and things we're dealing with heart issues and I pray it keeps beating until the time of the rapture I'll say this because my older son went to the camp my middle son went to the camp my daughter went to this camp in fact excuse me brother Tim but the very year we couldn't afford for her to go your pastor paid the way and on Wednesday night after church brother James I was on the internet getting her ticket and her and my wife flew to Louisiana and that year the Lord dealt with her life now she's married and going on with God my older son is married has a son my middle son Michael that went brother Jeremy Shriner how do you say sang that song last Sunday of Wingard ran and remember that year of the skid and they had the presentation of the prodigal son and you remember how they and they ran and when God ran you know God runs to those hearts that will cry out to him people cry out for alcohol they cry out for drugs I pray there be more of a crying out for God I need you Jesus I need you Lord I'm willing to humble myself and don't you worry there's always scoffers and mockers there's always churches that send their young people and I remember one year excuse me I'm getting personal but I remember getting videos of one church that sent their young people to the camp and on the way home they stopped at a rest area and the Holy Ghost had so moved on they're young people they're going around and around the van right at a rest areas nighttime I remember the videos and they went back to their home church and the pastor threw a bunch of cold water on that it's never been the same at that church because they don't like the emotion they don't feel that it was real they don't want their young people to be a part of that atmosphere I say they need more of that atmosphere instead of pouring water on it I would have been pouring gasoline on it I would have been saying what can we do to oftentimes they're just trying to justify their backslidden States and their churches are cold and indifferent and they have young people come back home on fire garden they're just quick to say all that's just emotion they stand up and give a testimony and a few months later they're back into a city raishin worse than ever before I think there ought to be a change to that I think we need to feed that and encourage that and say what can we do for our families you have strong young people you have strong families you have strong families you have strong church but this year I'm challenging you we've received oil we've received wine but now God is holding us accountable to have that for someone else he put him up on his own beast and carried him to the end that means he had something to give out let me give you another illustration how many times does a farmer work his field they plant the field they weed the field they water the field they cultivate the field they fertilize it they harvest it then the rains come then they have a bunch of locusts come through then it rains too much of just their crop failure they all you know what they do the next year they plant again they weed again the water again they cultivate just because you have a bad winter you have you know it's not going good what is it it's the nature of the farmer and I want to say tonight God will keep working his field and I'm happy to be a laborer with him all you say this young person did that that young lady did you hear about what's going on with that young lady did you know what that young man it doesn't matter we just keep planting we just keep leading is this OK tonight I went back to the heart you know how many times does it beat it just keeps beating and you go through a trial and it gets to justice or William runs in soccer too it goes fast goes fast and then you just it's time for a rest or your heart needs to be a farmer you plants and waters then you have a big bunker crop and you just laid in store praise the Lord all glory be to God but in the time of peace we need to prepare for war say why are you talking like this brother John because God's raising up a generation there has some character that's why the older generation many times gets nervous and concerned because many of them went through the Great Depression or they went through times of hardship and the new generation has everything handed to them given to them many of them don't want to work and they want this and they expect their iPhone or their Android they expect clothes and shoes they expect there's everything's given to them you know given to them how much is the camp fee how much Oh we'll just pay it for you we want you to be at camp oh you can't afford it or maybe the pastor pay it or this and that it it gets to a place where we just everything just oh I'll take it easy well maybe it's good this year for them to pay their own way or if they paid the hundred and twenty dollars it would mean more time or maybe dad and mom ain't so abusive to me anyway I've heard that phrase my my parents are abusive our ministers are so hard on us mine and I've heard that by good good families a mother and father trying to help their family along and and their young people get older and they throw out my back in their face they're abusive to us when really they ought to be happy that God put the walls up and put the protection around them y'all know where I'm coming from and you have good ministry that's concerned about our living hallelujah we're preparing our hearts tonight for the season can we all take a deep breath it came up on my phone this afternoon thunderstorms in the area thunderstorms severe thunderstorm on that's incredible there's gonna be those times it just seems like it rains it pours and there's other times the Sun comes out but it's not all the time it's not always going to be like this say brother John it's just what you said why does my life have to be so public and why do I have to feel like it's just wrong out there well there will be another spring with a little bit of oil and a little bit of you're gonna heal you're gonna get stronger you're gonna wake up and realize life is worth living hallelujah serving Christ isn't always easy it's not always the easier road many times it's the harder road is that truth let me go to the next slide I was so challenged by this do you all see that turtle I'm taking you back to your youth banquet that brother John was streaming but the Danny spoke about this it's talking about the turtles and how I'm bringing this back to your memory to trigger something in your heart he gave an illustration and spoke about it in words I'm gonna give it to you visually in this illustration we see there's the lights of the city that these little turtles are being born in on the sand and because the lights of the city are so strong the turtles are being born and turning toward the lights of the city and they're finding them the next morning all along the streets and the sidewalks dead because the lights of the city was so strong I hope you're thinking spiritual that many of them died instead of going toward the ocean when the line of the moon should have been so strong how many knows the moon is a reflection of the church that should be reflecting the Sun so when haziness comes in the church and clouds come in the family and things begin to cover over the strength of the church the young people start to turn toward the world the lights of the city the lights of the world begins to pull so strongly brother Joe that it pulls them into death and watch this as we look on the screen they find them the next day on the streets of the city they've turning their eyes toward the lights of the city and here's a photo I won't keep it there long this is what happens to someone that lost their way say what happened to that young person how could they lose their way it's because the lights of the world was calling to them and they got out on a road and Satan destroyed them don't let this be your testimony it's time that the Bride of Christ realized that you are the light of the world and if the light loses its it's it's as pull then our young people being born in the message will turn toward the lights of the world and it has a pull on them and we find them on the streets of Laodicea they're squashed I say God send a Holy Ghost revival keep our family strong keep our church strong bring in ministries and bring in you know ministries are like doctors and if you have a special need it's not just many times a general doctor you need you need someone that's trained whether it's a heart specialist or a knee specialist sir your hip is out you don't just need a foot doctor you need a hip doctor they've done that before they've been there before sometimes it's not all general I'll just read your Bible and pray oh come on pull your pants up you understand the phrase let us get into the word sometimes it takes someone that can just say the right word it can be in the right season pour in oil pour in wine that person can be healed and strengthened and be a contribution to the body that's what we need to hear and the lights of the city now they're actually intimate because the resorts and the condos are coming so close to the ocean they're actually putting certain lighting you can see it here on the screen a before photo and then an after photo how they're even enforcing the laws to change the effect of the lighting so the turtles when born can go toward the habit I'll go to the ocean because there's a desire to see them live see them thrive that wish we had another service but the older generation wants to trust you they want to give you the baton they want to say go for it brother go for it sister they want to have confidence in you but they're there looking for the Christ for the character I think it's time to rise to the occasion like Joshua and Caleb they were willing to go forward into the new land hallelujah I trust this is good tonight to prepare your heart and this is the strength of the Moon and some of you might be standing on the shore maybe you're just at that valley of decision I hope this year God can really do a turn in your heart to realize what God's done for me I want to see it for someone else if God can give a solid strong families those families are to be dedicating themselves to the body and saying what can we do for somebody else and that excuse me but I'm gonna be real honest right here how many believe in the token that all you and your household shall be saved our children will be saved this promise is unto you and your children Rahab bring them in and they're going to be saved we preach that we apply that but the Birman said I I believe it for myself I believe it for my family and I believe it for all of you but never have we been in a generation like this where we have young people and families being raised in the message and in good families and in good churches where people making their choices of not to serve God and to go into the world oh you say you have so many adults now that are almost becoming stunned where did we go wrong or what should we have done and in fact it ought to be just the opposite it ought to be Lord you gave them to us we apply the token we commit them to you that's up to God to take care of that but many times God gives us strong families in the church but there's weak families in the church there's families that are broken and when Jesus said that can you bear with me for just a moment the poor you have with you always it's not just poor financially there are people that are poor in spirit poor in Revelation poor and in just mental capacities their health is poor and we will bear them right till the time of the change there will be men and women in the church that bear ye one another's burdens and instead of looking down on people and looking at one another's weakness we need to learn to block for one another and if somebody fumbles the ball we need to pick it up I'm preaching a pre-camp service there are those that no matter what you do pour it in have a great service they just continue to just go bad and worse and seem like they're going in the negative direction but you've got to let your face stay with Christ stay with the word I hope that helps somebody I believe God's preparing our hearts now for the seasons I believe there's some victories that's going to be a hit and it might not happen the way you're expecting in fact it might be just the opposite the way you think I've seen ministers in a service look so bored and looked like they're getting nothing nothing after it and there's someone else in the same service that is connecting and that's exactly what that person needed I've seen older ones you see you know they go to sleep they lose interest say where are they coming from and another person in that service say that was thus saith the Lord is it's like you were saying things that me and my wife was talking about last night or me and my children we just dealt with that yesterday I've personally dealt with it in the ministry and gotten a lot of grief and and coming back from elders only to get another response from another person and say that was exactly what I needed do you know what that I'd to do stop being so a person that so arose over and complex and you just take the blows and grow in Christ and keep pressing on it's time to come out of your caves I'll just be honest with you there's times that people just take a sabbatical it's like they're off for months for years you say they used to be right into it they what can I do now they just come to check they've lost a fire they've lost their desire they used to be on the edge of their seat they used to be so yes Lord yes Lord they come early now they're just so casual you can't hardly get them to move they hardly dare they miss the service and don't matter what happened we talked about people losing their mind in the world or going insane it can happen to a good person the pressures of life life goes on there's no mercy on any person white person black person Chinese person pink person good people bad people we all have pressure and as we get older or our health is failing we can get Moody brother branham talked about me may I pray God never crown my life to be a crab an old man I don't want to be crab it I don't want to be a person that it's never good enough it's never the music is never good enough the preachings never good enough there's always some weakness some problem god help us in that area I'll say like David I'd rather spend a day in the house of the Lord with people that love God and are going forward you know but you can get in the world and and there it's just not cool those young people are simple they're brainwash you're so funny and if we're not careful we can have people right in the church that live two lives when they're around the church people they're holy they're good they know how to be and then on the job in the school at the university that's like another person I pray God bring a change to that pour in the oil pouring the wine give us divine pulsations give us supernatural visitations now I'm praying for Thursday night Friday morning Friday night Saturday night Sunday morning God give us dealings of the Holy Ghost that is God said God might not be talking to you the same but there might be another person God is walking right in their front door discerning everything about their lives and we need to bear their burdens by staying interested staying in prayer I'm admonishing you tonight I'm encouraging here this is now 30 40 years of brother John being raised in the message and going through camps and preaching three camp services and then the service after camp and and being able to understand how the Lord's dealing in our assembly now I'm bringing it to your church it's important that we learn to recognize the signs of God's dealings and seize those moments I think it's important to recognize these are precious times these are precious times you just talked to somebody that's in jail tonight and they'll tell you they wish they were free they wouldn't care about what kind of car they had to drive what kind of clothes like just get me out of these jail clothes I'm so embarrassed why I'm in here and they're in there for a year two years five years it's like how could I be so stupid how could I be so dumb drugs and alcohol and people steal stuff Satan gets him on a treadmill of life we need to learn to seize these moments and hold fast to Christ I've talked to young ladies I prayed with them I've talked to young men I was with a young man just a few days ago and even weeks ago and then we baptized him down in our Seattle church he had such a life that he couldn't cross the border and duis and all kinds of trouble and things and we baptized him and he gave his heart to the Lord he said pray for me I've got this appointment Tuesday I'm we prayed with him and God gave him grace before the judge I get I had a tech just a week ago and he said pray for me announce I've come time through and I have to stand before the judge I might have to go to jail I'm I'm expecting to go to jail because the the judge is a certain way and this is what's happening in the community and he was going he's been married since we baptized him to someone that was in our church and a family here's just he's out in the world and months ago we went to a home and spoke to him about baptism and we just kind of nurtured him as a young man just worldly person but he gave his heart to the Lord we baptized him and we've got to be willing to take baby steps with people and he texted me said pray for me I'm just expecting they could throw the book at me they could and we prayed with the Lord stood for him and the judge gave him mercy didn't even give him no time gave him probation you know what that does for a new Christian it breeze hoping to them it breeze faith into them oh you say brother John you're way out there we don't even deal with those things well God gave us a lot of wounded people people that were thrown aside people that were didn't have it all together hallelujah to restore them and speak to them in a way that I believe we are about right for a real revival of God I believe some of your families that the time is right for a real time that the word is calling to us to move on up just a little bit higher it's time for the turtles to start turning in the right direction that little illustration spoken to your young people at your right back in this fellowship hall brother John has take that it to at least six other churches and gatherings of people to show them that God is concerned about their birth about the direction in their life God doesn't want you out on the streets of some city just becoming pavement for the devil and I pray we would not just take these things as little stories little but take them to heart take this to heart tonight to prepare yourself and in closing tonight I want to say this I was listening to a message that was mentioned during our camp for our young people one of the brothers mentioned it and so after I just started listening to it listening to it what is that in thy hand brother Branham said at the beginning of the service he was thinking of the crippled people and the people in wheelchairs now they're in stretchers and carts and he said oh I see there's crutches laying under that man's chair just ask God that he'll let them walk out of here today without their support I thought isn't that wonderful cots and stretchers and and and and crutches it was the prayer of the ministry now this is oil in mine that they would walk out of there without that support I think that ought to be our attitude approaching things not what I can get out of it but what can the people get out of this do you know what happened at the end of that service brother branham started to talk about Shamgar and how God anointed him and he and the enemy was coming to take away his crop and he saw his wife and saw his children and the Philistines were taking a crop every year every summer they'd lay it up and then the enemy would come and his righteous indignation God all God up he said he said and that's what ought to happen to you here on these cots and stretchers and we come into eastern youth tent there's young people come in burden and troubled can you help me as I close the service they're not in physical wheelchairs that aren't in spirit you know stretchers and filling up the whole altar with cots and there's not a lot of people with crutches but spiritually Satan comes in through the year and he's nothing but a robber and a thief and he destroys and takes their joy and takes their passion and takes tries to steal their experience I think it's time that the ministry began to give freedom to be able to say I trust they walk out of here without that kind of support take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there say I'm gonna go in with these things and I'm gonna leave with them no God says no you leave them right here brother Branham said Shamgar got his riding just nicked indignation up and he said that's what ought to happen to these on the carts and stretchers just get a little mad at the devil forget about your nice hair and what people's gonna think about your clothes and well if I go up there think I'm back slid well friends the altar is more than just for black Cillian people it's for young people that want to get right with God and for those that say God I want to consecrate myself you know what do God that all the pews were gone all the chairs were gone and the whole sanctuary was just a place of the altar we get so comfortable sitting down I know if people that stream the camps that would love to be there and you see people there they're just so uh and there's young people that are watching those meetings they're weeping they're crying and they say how can that be brother John I've been and been with young ladies from Poland and then say brother John I'm the only young lady young person in our church and we were having a special meeting in Poland there and they come from Czech Republic in all the countries surrounding there this young lady came all the way across Poland she said brother John I'm the only young person in our church she's so hungry for the things of God let alone five six seven hundred young people do you know that your voice has went around the world there's young ladies and young men that are just there drinking it in soaking it in they die to be in your place tonight they died I have a daddy like you got a mother like you God preachers like this brother Craig's away tonight in Baton Rouge but look at this platform men that love you to give you I'll give you wine say their bird and they talk about this they talk about that it's a good thing they talk about it I stand here tonight as a trophy of God's amazing grace somebody had patience with me somebody put up with me somebody bore our burdens and was willing to listen hallelujah they didn't some mere silence and you're no good you're never gonna make it I'll sit down and shut up no they were encouraging they were positive they they picked you out they bound up the wounds they didn't come walking in saying you look horrible that was a horrible myth has a horrible you know sometimes we all feel like our lives are horrible and that's the very same God is working out a miracle he's working a character see your life but you gotta be willing to turn toward the the light of the word and say Lord I don't understand everything but I want to serve you tonight we need to get mad at the devil we need to say if I'd lost years of Eila it's time to come back from your sabbatical it's time for you to end your sabbatical and say this year I'm gonna make a difference for Christ you remember the person out on the street they had the sign say I'm a fool for Christ I'm a fool for Christ and on the back it said whose fool are you I tell you what the owner of Amazon that's worth billions and billions and billions his billions didn't make his marriage happy hello he's from Seattle right from that area or Microsoft and Bill Gates and Aldi they make their millions and billions it doesn't make them happy when they get a divorce now it's just dividing up their billions and you go with this TV anchorwoman and you go here and there's children involved there's crashes Lord keep a simple keep us humble learn if you've got to keep us to where we're just small but let us be willing Lord to give oil and wine to those that come and realize that God heals God's in the business of healing God heals by music God heals by love God heals by just a little bit of love stretched out over a hurt I love brother Timothy because one day in the middle of a revival somebody stir going on here brother Timothy stepped out and started walking right other brothers not even here today and walked right down this aisle and put his arms around a man that was right second or third row over brother John saw that brother Timothy I don't even know the brother's name bald-headed brother kind of a beard God saw that say why don't you just deal with this your song Lee dinner you should be praying for this no the Lord must delayed that I'm brother Timothy's heart God make us more burden for somebody else do you remember that brother Timothy sometimes you got to get out of your comfort zone you got to get out of yourself brother Kenneth Middleton you have been a blessing to me floods have tried to take you Cantor's tried to take you family issues go on and look at him back there he's willing to come in in a wheelchair on a Sunday night service and some of us walk around we run around we can eat food we can have fun hallelujah God give us more burden people give us people that are you know and that's what's gonna happen at this camp I believe God is gonna bring healing God heals by music God heals by medicine God heals by prayer this is November sorry April 1963 sometimes a little grudge an old place it'll heal right over just a little love and a little care just a little care I care for your brother your hand up on their shoulder a person expresses their heart we're so busy we got to get going we got other things know sometimes we need to listen stop talking just listen be like the Samaritan the Levite was too busy the priest was too busy and God's asking you exist you hear stop being so busy have some oil have some wine be ready in Jesus name God bless you let's bow our heads together but it's preparing us trying to see those that are interested in the symphony who's interested he's looking out over the orchestra saying who's interested and you see the beat of the sheet music and it goes along for a certain time then there's a burst here and then the drums begin to play then God begins to call on this person over here because there's a drama in this great sympathy and God knows as the composer and it's time for a change and he's looking out over the orchestra the sympathy saying who's interested in the change who's willing to turn brother John I'm so used to going in this certain way I'm so used to playing my life in a certain way me and my husband me and my wife it's we and us and my brother John we're older up in years now we're just concerned about our health now and our grandchildren or something but God is asking you to get a much broader vision say my young person's gone to the world or they're getting cold on God why don't you begin to pray for other young people and other brothers and other children and start getting a bird and be a counselor can I sweep the floor can I come and pray [Music] can I come a little early and pray for that young lady she's struggling [Music] God forgive us if we've been guilty [Music] looking at the hind of parts of one another people fumbling around people making mistakes if we're not careful we start making fun of them and start singing people singing and trying to do their best and we're making fun we're laughing maybe there needs to be a change of heart saying God you've brought me into this body forgive me if I've been guilty of that Jesus I wonder tonight if you can lend your shoulder to the wheel and say Lord this Easter this camp that's coming up I want to be more sensitive [Music] God given us oil and wine but maybe there's somebody else that needs the same are you willing to be unselfish this year are you willing to go through this without any personal gain or glory or recognition and say brother John if no one even knows but I'm gonna make a contribution I'm gonna do something I'm gonna set myself aside in prayer I'm gonna give in a certain direction because remember the gift is getting out of the way are you willing to get out of the way it said Jesus use us this year greater than ever before use our church greater than the 32 years we have our hearts have beaten we've planted we've watered and sometimes we can stand and get weary and sometimes we can go through and say here we go again and we can coil up the wires and we can put gas in the engine and we can prepare our notes look down over the list okay it can just start getting mechanical we can just start going through the motions or we can say God put feeling back in again for us who would say Lord you've given me wine and oil I'm making myself available for somebody else would you slip up your hand to say Lord use these hands use this heart that beats under this hand use these feet strengthen us Lord as we come into this the Ministry the counselors the workers but as an assembly we approach it preparing ourselves we're about 10 days out 11 days Lord were preparing ourselves for the oil and the wine Heavenly Father I know that I'm just a visitor here I'm not the pastor and I'm not the associate pastor the brothers that work week after week with the sheep and this assembly but we're still part of the team we're still part of the body of Christ and we've seen the years of success and fruits that have come from the labors now of what we're approaching in the next few days let us set ourselves aside don't let us be like robots and like people that have just done this before but let us be a people that's invigorated let the blood flow but the heart beat again let the seeds be planned to turn on the sprinklers Lord let there be showers of blessing pour out your spirit upon the musicians Lord that seniors and The Specials let the ministers Lord it be laid upon their hearts even now and in the coming days strongly I believe you can prepare a minister for weeks and years and months I believe you can change the direction right by their standing at the pulpit [Music] because somebody's calling there's a sheep that fell over the crevice somebody needs Lord Jesus I was that person we've never been the same and that night we raised a hand we gave our hearts to you and we're baptized we have never been the same we've come to camps we've been in meetings it's one of these brothers it's on the platform have ministered to my soul and the souls of my children and now my grandchildren my little grandson when they he hears the voice and they see the preacher and they wonder what his brothers wouldn't Pappajohn listening to you and they see it's the church it's singing it's ministry Lord don't never let us get too old in our hearts for the fire of the Holy Spirit to be shared with somebody else put oil into us God put wine in to us Lord Jesus let us be a people that's prepared now I pray the Holy Spirit would empower this congregation for these next days Lord as they set themselves aside and prepare for the victories may you water the seeds and may there be great crops and in the weeks and months to come my pastors and churches long time as the young people go back home here men and women say this troubles gone that spirit has been left people saying my sadness has been turned into joy for weeks and weeks people becoming to their pastors testifying of spiritual healing that took place in the name of Jesus maybe the Holy Ghost sweeping through the midst of your people we're preparing ourselves for it tonight's meeting was preparing ourselves for those kind of meetings Lord Jesus heal our sick Lord touch those that are discouraged let the feeble need and let the hands down be lifted up tonight maybe we go from the sunday meetings with our hearts full of joy there's a work for us to do
