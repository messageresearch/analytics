========================================

hello everyone we are the ministry team but evening like Tabernacle and it's great that you join with us again today and hope that you will invite your friends to come and join with us in this roundtable discussion we got some great things to talk about this today as we promised we're gonna be talking about the church and how it fell away and how Satan got into even the book of Acts Church and but I'd like to start off with a scripture here today because we were talking about the vine and the branches and and the husbandman of course is the caretaker of the vineyard and he is looking for fruit and James five and seven said be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain be patient also establishing hearts for the coming of the Lord draw nigh so we see that tied in with the husbandmen looking for fruit is the coming of the Lord and it's near coming he is going to be looking for fruit and he's going to look for the fruit the same kind of fruit that he had from the original vine and so we've had all kinds that have been grafted in man made the ideas and I had things that are grafted into Christianity but he's looking for his fruit that's right man that's right so what happened to that first church what happened where did where did the devil come in I believe there's a wealth of understanding that we can draw to see how he worked in that first church and how he would work today what was prophesied to come I think it would be very nice to to dig in there what happened to that first trip I think Paul gives us to war in acts 20 verse 28 he says take heed and that word too means be cautious so take heed unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church most their charge was to feed the church right yeah take care of them to nurture them to admonish them in the in the Word of God which he had purchased with his own blood and he says for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves that were Grievous I looked it up and the word there means mighty dangerous so strong that the fever flock the feeble flock will not be able to resist them so they are dangerous and mighty the cunning they know what they're doing right and so we find that Paul has given us the layout or the plan of how the Antichrist or how the that devil is going to come into the church and begin to pull the church away and he says the grievous woes are going to enter in not sparing the flock fleecing the sheep not feeding the Sheep oh my and we find that that's what they're doing but he also gave another warning he says in verse 30 also of your own selves shall men arise not only are they coming from the outside they're coming from within as well and their whole goal and the whole mission is to fleece the flock to destroy the flock and at the same time under the auspice of feeding i've taken care of they're obviously interested more in building their own Kingdom instead of building the king it says so it says the very end of that verse says it says to draw away disciples after them no I'd rather get this their wardrobe means to tear away oh wow so there their whole plan is to tear away tear away from what from the truth from the gospel that Paul originally planted and laid out their desires to tear the flock to the people away from the truth so he can put his own plan or his own desires in to have his church and brother Joe you said something interesting that men would arise from within and Jesus said this exactly as Paul was speaking of wolves Jesus said it exactly he said they would come as wolves but they would be in sheer clothes meaning it would be very inoffensive it would be it would it would look look like something good yes like Christianity like the church but it is religious oh it is religious and that's what people fail to see is that Satan is very religion religious and he wants worship and so the worship that belonged to God he wants to take to himself but he does it in a way of not coming along and say I'm Satan worship his love not him standing the pulpit with forked horns and a pitchfork that home he's got a suit and towel and he's saying Jesus Jesus yeah yeah is that Jesus of their own making paul says speaking perverse things notice what they're speaking of speaking perverse things and that is distorting the truth or posing or a plot against the saving purpose and plans of god to corrupt to turn aside from the correct path so there they're saying things but it's not what Paul says just a little twist it's just a little twist like this it sounds religious and it sounds good but there's four it takes that ear to hear what their spirit says amen and can rightly divide the word and discern what is right and what is wrong and I believe that God has gifted me in today that can discern the Spirit of Christ and desert the spirit of the Antichrist so they can know which spirit is correct and which spirit is not correct so so it's not a complete denial of Scripture or denial of Christ is just a twist like jesus said beware of the leaven of the Pharisees yeah and 11 is comes in silently it just comes in secretly but it permeates the whole yeah so so just a little twist can actually bring death you know what I find interesting in reading the book of Acts is just we've been talking about acts 2 and the experience on the day of Pentecost but just a few chapters down they say that they mentioned a certain sect of Pharisees which believe you know think so why and Jesus will look at a Pharisee in techology you're of your father the devil mine yeah so how in the world did Pharisees get in there but yet still believe mm-hmm so they believe and still be Pharisees yeah I mean you know Kenny this is really amazing you know somebody's a believer and yet he still Pharisees you know if you become a believer you know then you would have believed the precepts of Christ rather than Pharisee ISM but you see that was so ingrained so they were they were intent on bringing that whole thing in and perverting the gospel of Jesus Christ exactly you know and changing it back to works instead of grace again and and and turn it to the precepts of man and traditions yeah traditions of man what they use scripture yeah they use scripture introducing trying to reintroduce circumcision right exactly and so it looked very good especially to Jews in that time it looked very good and it even caused a struggle with the leaders of the Church of that day even Paul and all of them come together over the matter because it looks so close but it was leaven yeah yeah and it goes to show that the Pharisees that believed had issues well you know when we see those things were not to be passive about it I like how Paul said we had no small dissension with them yes we stood against it praise the Lord exactly well you know that's acts 15 1 is what we're referring to and they they said except to be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved so salvation began to be set on precepts it was not even the conditions of what Christ gave at Calvary because of course you know we must be circumcised but that circumcision is the cutting off of fleshly desires yes by the Holy Ghost amen and so it was it was a real circumcision from the Imps of the inside and the changing of the nature but they they were still trying to apply the external rather than realize the internal work that had to be done to change the nature amen so they were reverting the church back or in Galatians chapter 2 3 it says but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised right that because of false brother unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our Liberty which we have in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into bondage so reverting they were actually taking the church into bondage so what was the motivation what was the spirit behind it it was not Christ that would bring into bondage it was the Antichrist that's right and in first John chapter 2 verse 18 it says little children it is the last time and as you have heard that Antichrist shall come even now there are many Antichrist whereby we know that it is the last time hmm I think it was really striking word that he said it was brethren but their false brother false brother so there were people who were naming the name of Christ but had not been cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost from the the ideas of man and come to have a spirit lead spirit-directed Bible doctrine that they adhered to so it had to be a people they believed the Pharisees that believed brother and false brother how did they get to this point because I mean they apparently sympathized with the belief they apparently you know saw some good some good in it but somehow they did not receive the same life that Peter and the ones on the day of Pentecost received they missed the Holy Ghost you know and it gets the point where Jesus you referred to that Jesus speaking about the wolves and sheep clothes and you read on down he says they'll come to me and that day saying we cast out Devils we've you know done many mighty works and he'll look at them and say depart from me you workers of iniquity for I never knew you yeah good and that new is not knowing there on the earth I mean God all things he knows ever flee that jumps ever fly that Batson's I so he knew that there was on the earth but that knew if you look at it it's actually a relationship is actually the life of God being transferred I never knew you and I think that's where these where this church started ended up they all started ended up accepting people and allowing things to happen but these people never became leaders they became great men you so to speak but they never received the Holy Ghost on short following shores know these things you Pharisees you can you can see it even today in a sense that they believed but y'all said they missed the Holy Ghost so it shows that it has to be more than just a belief that's when these aren't secret believers these are professed believers yeah right and yet they don't have the Holy Ghost they don't have the same life so it has to be something more they didn't receive the Holy Ghost when they believed obviously no no no they obviously did Paul said have you received the Holy Ghost since you've been since you gave me after you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise so you're believing unto the Holy Ghost not that you received the Holy Ghost when you believe but you believe unto it until you receive that's right and I think I think these Pharisees which believe or a good manager and they had good intentions they saw the goodness of Christ and saw merit to many of the wonderful things but they missed that light and that's why there that they could not rightly divide the word of truth you see we have a mistaken idea today in Christianity and that is that you can educate someone into Christ or you can educate ministers into ministry and really it's a divine call of God that has to come by a Holy Ghost experience exactly you know Jesus said do not do not preach do not do anything you go and you wait in in that Upper Room into in Jerusalem until your endued with power from on high so he wouldn't send them out to preach or do anything until they first got that power amen and this is what was lacking in those Pharisees they were lacking that power we think we can educate people into it there was no one more educated than the Pharisees Oh even in the scripture yeah there was no the Apostles could never sit down and debate Scripture as far as knowledge wise with those Pharisees not but when it came right down to it Paul said I had to count everything I had learned he wasn't speaking of worldly things and he was spiritually of the face of his religious training yeah exactly and all the knowledge he had he said I had to count it all this dunk yeah that I might win Christ amen well then in first John four and three it tells us about the spirit of Antichrist where have you heard that should come and even now already it is in the world so all the way back there the spirit of the Antichrist was already in the world and people were receiving instead of the Spirit of God was receiving the spirit of the Antichrist yes through knowledge instead of by the experience of an in Perth isn't that amazing that they would take on a spirit of the Antichrist because he said he said this is that spirit of the Antichrist yes and so rather than receiving the spirit and life of Christ they were actually receiving then the spirit of the Antichrist which we know is Satan because it is a pervert of the gospel of Christ but back to what you said earlier that that Satan don't always come with a forked tail and claws and horns but he comes as an angel of light uh-huh and so it spoke of here in 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 verse 4 if he cometh preaching if for if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus so Paul was not speaking of some atheistic communist ik satanic force no he's speaking of something that would look like Jesus that would be presented as Jesus uh-huh he said for if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom you have not preached hmm whom we have not preached or if you receive another spirit which you've not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might bel bear with him so so Paul is speaking now speaking of another Jesus that would be commonly accepted right another spirit another Jesus another gospel that's right yes and that's what they were receiving and so you know here was this gospel was not saying oh well there's there's no such thing as Jesus Christ and no he didn't die on the cross but they were they were actually bringing in and some of the very concepts of Christ but twisting it and just enough way you know that it become instead of the the gospel of Christ it become actually the gospel of the Antichrist my and and such a deceiving thing and then people in their experience for getting another spirit which was not the Jesus of the Bible but was the Jesus actually of their own making handling the Word of God deceitfully that's right and it's amazing to me how quickly it happened and here we are two thousand years down the road how much has gone on how much has that antichrist spirit worked because here we are in the first church talking about men that walked with Jesus yes talking about did you talk about leadership I mean that church had this just strong leadership of men that it came from the upper room so men like Paul who had met the pillar of fire you know they were there on the road and it had blinded him and yet even with those leaders in that atmosphere of the early church he was able to worm his way in mine he's no amateur well I think as each generation further further further away from the initial fire that felled you started seeing that decline and worse for the love and the power and the passion for Christ for the word beginning to fain begin to wane over time because it was it was a hearsay become a tradition here and you find that shortly after Paul went off the scene we're looking 300 years later they had to have some kind of counsel and we'll get further into that later on but they had to have a counsel good just you know to figure out debates in the church because there was so much dissension within the early church because they got further and further and further away from the truth it's a very very good point then maybe we can pick up on that that the cycle of revivals if we study revivals they follow a pattern there's a pattern in the Bible just exactly what you said that when God brings a revival initially there's an illumination there is a power there is a an overcoming there's a victory there's a glory but just the next generation something begins to change well you think about the first church Ephesus as we recall you found it in Revelations that word means aimed at but relaxed so they were aimed at the truth they were caught they were set afire but they begin to get relaxed and with their maybe their knowledge from an axe with what they know and just wasn't alive with the power and the passion of you know they had the knowledge without the power of exactly without the life of it exactly and and so this is this is part of the restoration we must not only just receive a knowledge of the very power of Christ under salvation you know because it's the power of God exactly so in on next session I think it would be good if we could talk about more about this falling away and how the first church lost his first love and how the Antichrist you know wormed its way into that early church and then continued to waste because I think we'll find as we go along that the falling away isn't just an endtime event right but the falling way has been a long long time thank you for joining the ministry team at evening light tabernacle for more
