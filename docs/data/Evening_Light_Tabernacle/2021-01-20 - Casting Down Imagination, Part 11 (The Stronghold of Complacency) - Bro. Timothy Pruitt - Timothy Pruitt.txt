medicine well i believe that no matter how god chooses to use it and do his work he's the one that heals amen and we just do our part whether it's medically to put bones in the place they should be or to put skin in the place it should be it's god that does the healing to bind it together and we're certainly thankful for the many praise reports that we've heard this evening amen if you have a knee

mentioned god we know that our prayers don't fall on deaf ears oh many times sometimes the devil would make us think that they don't our prayers are not heard they don't go past the ceiling but father there's not a prayer that's ever uttered or mentioned but what you know about it and not only that you know about it but you already are interceding on behalf you're already removing the cogs of your will and position to provide the miracle that we're in need of lord it may be a physical situation tonight it may be a financial situation tonight it may be a job situation whatever the situation is

one part of it fall to the ground but we'll fulfill every part father what a blessed people we are what a honor it is to be your children lord tonight we commit to service your hands we we thank you father for your grace and mercy in our lives and we want to say thank you lord ask that you bless your service father help us to step out of the way we ask it in jesus name amen let's turn to second corinthians familiar scripture that we've been reading and pulling from second corinthians 10 and verse 4. said for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ amen you can be seated i just speak to you get on casting down imaginations but to hone in or to talk about the stronghold of complacency you know complacency and is really a sister if you want to say or a brother to lukewarmness you know we was reading last wednesday in revelations 3 and verse 15 he said i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that thou art cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth and we notice he said they are neither cold nor hot they were lukewarm and lukewarm meaning to have a lack of enthusiasm or a lack of passion or a lack of fervency in other words it means to be without earnest interest or interested in something very passionately it is it's more or less a take it or leave it attitude and we see in this time that people in this age have become very very careless and very relaxed and very indifferent towards the things of god you know a great man of god through the ages there mr brother spurgeon made this statement i thought it was quite interesting as i was looking at this today said it's harder a great deal to work for jesus with a church which is lukewarm than it would be to begin without a church he says give me a dozen earnest spirits and put me down anywhere in london and by god's help we will soon cause the wilderness and the solitary places to rejoice he said but give me the whole lot of a lot half-hearted half undecide undecided unconcerned what can i do he said only drag upon a man's zeal in a man's earnestness he said 5 000 members of a church all lukewarm will be 5 000 impediments but a dozen earnest passionate spirits determined that christ shall be glorified souls shall be won we must be more than conquerors and every weakness and fewness will res in their very weakness and fewness will reside capacities for being more largely blessed of god he said it's better nothing than lukewarmness you know and i believe that's the way our our heart ought to be i'd rather be nothing than be lukewarm amen but instead of you know being lukewarm i believe that we can be fervent about the things of god and passion and about the things of god you know and he would read on you read on in revelations 3 as we begin to dissect this church this laodicean church he said because i sayest i'm rich and increased with goods and have needham nothing and knoweth not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked and he said i counseled thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i salve that thou mayest see you know brother branham would say he said you know the the scripture says i have need of nothing he says when anybody says i have need of nothing they very well be might as well be saying i have everything or be saying i don't want any more i'm full he said see you can express this any way you want to but it all adds up to the fact that the church is complacent she's satisfied with what she has she either figures she has it all or has enough and he said that's exactly what we find today complacency is a self-satisfied state of negligence or carelessness especially in relation to one personal situation you know the bible and proverbs would say for the simple or killed by their turning away and the complacency of fools destroy them notice it talks about it equates the complacency with fools or simples or someone that's naive and throughout the whole book of proverbs it would refer to these these terms of simple and fools or naive people to describe people who don't give thoughts to their lives or who are people who aren't intentional about honoring god and walking in his ways i believe when we're going to walk in his ways we ought to be intentional about it amen when we come to those church we ought to be intentional about it amen amen we worship him it ought to be something that we are have a fervency a desire to give all that we have to him amen a naive one or a fool lives only to please themselves you know they do what feels good regardless of whether it is good amen regardless of even if it's god's will or not the bible says their complacency will destroy them and we consider the definition again self-satisfaction especially when accompanied with by awareness of actual dangers or deficiencies and in other words to be complacent is to feel comfortable when you should be concerned did you get that complacent is to become feel comfortable when you should be concerned amen it's willfully ignoring the fact that you're not where you should be or neglecting what you ought to be doing amen it's the thing james talked about when he says remember it is a sin to know what you ought to do and then not do it amen you know there's a fine line you know people say well i'm not complacent i'm content there's a fine line between contentment and complacency you know actually you could take the thought you know as a man described it in this way he says you know there's a certain snake is a coral snake and you it's also another snake that's not that coral snake's very deadly and very poisonous and and can kill you in just a few moments but there's another state that looks just like it but it has a maybe a few different characteristics about it but it's very it's a call it's a harmless king snake and it does a lot of good and it keeps you know passed away and but knowing the difference between them could be the matter of life and death and knowing the difference between a contentment and complacency amen is the matter between life and death because contentment has more to do with trusting god you know when you've reached your limits or when you're not the most in a comfortable place but you're still trusting god and you know it doesn't doesn't mean that you don't have joy or satisfaction in your life or or you have to be uncomfortable all the time but when you're content your satisfaction is focused on god amen when you're in contentment amen your gratitude you're you're in gratitude for what he's done for you and everything around you amen is is circling around him and what he's done for you amen your accompli your knowledge your limitations and but you'll be intentional about following the lord's lead where he leads me i will follow on the other hand being complacent is about being satisfied with yourself with your own pleasures when you know god has more important things and he wants to lead you into it's a state of stubborn man one man said it like this he said it's a state of stubborn stillness when god is actually wanting you to get up and move that's what complacency is and before long though complacency will lead to apathy and then to unbelief it may feel good now but the end the road is not pleasant you know contentment is being satisfied where god has placed you complacency is settling for the place god is telling you to leave amen god is telling you to get out of that doldrum get out of that situation get out of that thing and what we're we call it contentment just be content that's not being content god is telling you there's another step to take there's more land to possess there's no more promises to be fulfilled amen this year as we said you know we're looking at the fulfillment of prophecy it ought to drive back every every bit of lukewarmness out of our lives as as we see the time is ticking down and prophecies are being fulfilled so very fast there will not be complacency in our lives but there is complacency in people's lives you know it's amazing when you realize the complacency that led to apathy and belief you start seeing people who led and left them that left this message and left this truth it started with complacency you know it started with just allowing things to be and and not dealing with situations in their lives and and allowing bitterness to take place or allowing something to have preeminence in their lives instead of man being being active or fervent in the things of god amen a coldness started setting in and before you know it apathy took over until where unbelief has now taken them you know uh you know maybe some of you have seen it has been sent to me several times today about the inauguration of the new president and the vice president and i thought it was quite astounding when the vice president got out in the and what the media is saying royal purple dressed in royal purple and if you go back and look at what brother branham talked about it he described that he called out that very color you know and but even already people that has left the messages ah that's not purple that's blue you know complacency is taken over just complete unbelief they can see things right before them and willfully blind it started off with complacency it started out with settling for a place instead of leaving there and moving forward with god and saying god i need more of you amen sure they might have had an experience at a place sometime where god may have done something for them but they stayed there instead of moving on with god that's why we have to be very careful in our experience it needs to be a fresh and up-to-date experience come on somebody amen we need to be every day looking for more of god i want more in my life i want him in my everyday life i want him in my car i want him in my word i want him on my study i want him everywhere amen it ought not be just the happiness of uh even just you know have our christian duty to come to church while i fulfilled it no it's every day i'm a christian it's every moment i'm a christian it's every moment i'm living for him i'm looking for his appearing. hallelujah listen these signs that we're seeing should not bring sadness to your heart it ought to bring a rejoicing because these are the days we've been longing for many many prophets and and priests and kings there many wise people long for this day that we're living in and we're seeing prophecy being fulfilled it ought to put a joy in our heart any moment the dead in christ is going to rise any moment our god is going to return [Applause] but we see complacency at the very beginning there in the church ages we can see it there and we can read about the ephesus church there in the book of revelation it says these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks my that gives me peace right there because those seven golden candlesticks represents seven ages and he's walking in every age so even in this time we're living in he's still here among us amen and then he said i know thou works in thy labor and our patience how the death cannot bear them which are evil that has tried them will say their apostles and are not as found them liars and as born and has patience and for my name's sake have labored and hath not faith and nevertheless i am somewhat against thee because i have left thy first love remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come to thee quickly and remove that candlesticks out of this place except i repent but this is thou this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nickelodeons which are also hate he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen the very name ephesus has a meaning aimed at but relaxed it's a high aspirations of this age that had begun with the fullness of the spirit on the day of pentecost even the god came and broke out upon men and men did in amazing amen feats of the supernatural were taking place and it was started out like that but it didn't end like that amen to where there was such a depth of god they were aiming at the high calling of god but it begin to give way to a less watchful attitude unless art and following of jesus christ begin to manifest manifest itself as an omen that with the in the future ages the physical vehicle called the church would all sink way down into the awfulness of the depths of satan it had become relaxed and it was drifting that's why we need to make sure we're not being just drifters drift into one service and drift out and drift out three with rift that back in three you're just drifting amen the the love of god you know you know what it's like to have that fervency amen that desire that passion to know his word and and and that we don't want to be like leo to see it says i have need of nothing listen we don't want to be a people that can't ought take a a few moments of the word or even a few hours of the word and get tired of it come on now we want to be somebody that can soak in the word of god and eat upon the word of life because there's life to us it's more than just a do-good religion it's more than just doing my christian duty it's life to us but this tiny seed left his first love and this tiny seed planted in that ephesian age would one day grow into the spirit of air unto all foul birds of the air would roost in his branches so inoffensive to human reason was that little plant appear in that new eve the new church that again she would be deceived by satan and the ephesian age had presented her the opportunity to be god's best come on now we want to be god's best listen there are phenomenal people trying to be the devil's best they're impersonating spirits and spirits are coming out all over them but there's a people that are god's best hallelujah amen but while she prevailed for a moment but then she relaxed in an unguarded moment satan planted the seed of complete ruination he said i have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love to understand this you must must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the original saints of ephesus alone this message is to the entire age it went 120 years it's a message is to all the gentile generations in that span but history is now it keeps repeating itself in the generations of israel we'll see a revival in one only to see the fires fade in the next listen it was complacency that led that brought it that when israel got into egypt they began to realize how good it was in egypt and that boy they know it that complacency was as a frog in a little pot of water and the heat began to turn up and up and up until all of a sudden there was a pharaoh that didn't know joseph and the next thing you know there wasn't honored citizens of egypt they become slaves it was complacency that brought them there to that place in that moment of slavery and he says you see until where it goes up and it goes down it goes up and it goes down until now there's no vest vested whatsoever that original flame but then god will light the fire again and the same process is repeating he said it's simply the manifestation of the truth that god has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth any more than there's any truth to apostolic succession it isn't the word you start out with truly born again believers but then the next generation comes along and they're no longer just christians they've taken on a denominational name that's why our young people have to have their own experience that's why the old people's got to have enough christianity about them and enough fervency about them to create the atmosphere so they can have that experience it ain't all just on one group of people it's on all of us working together amen i've told people you wonder why your kids don't worship god and they don't put god in their life you ought to start looking at your own life [Applause] and all excuses that you made and you're done listen no excuse works in this age we're coming to the end of excuses you start out with truly born again but the next generation comes along and is plain christians you know they're no longer just christians they have to take on some name baptist methodist that's exactly what they are they're not christians you have to be born of the will of god not the will of man to be saved but these are now coming together by the will of man but he says but he says but see what happens is he says the fervent desire to please god the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out on the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of god it has cooled off and become formal maybe we need to change that a little bit the fervent desire to please god the passion to know his word the cry for the reaching and the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that person amen being on fire for god it'll be he begins to cool off and becomes a bit formal in his worship and formal in his attitude towards god and formal in the things of god and come on now the abandonment to god has died out and people were beginning to be more careful about the what the world thought about them instead of what god thought about them listen it's the truth i mean you see it even in message ranks when women start putting on paint on their faces that ain't to me god that's to meet men come on listen when jezebel put the paint on her face it wasn't to meet god it was to meet a man and people begin to work you can tell people are worried about what the world thinks about them we gotta have the new clothes we gotta have this we gotta have our style we gotta have it all instead of what god thinks about you what's on the inside of your heart that's what counts not about our dress and how much money we got in our closet and none of that matters second generation coming on just like israel they demanded the king to be the net be like a king to be like other nations when they did they rejected god that is the history of the church when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to god it isn't long until you see them stop doing things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially they change their manner of dress their attitudes their behavior they get lacks that's what ephesus means relax drifting listen you can go right back to the pentecostal ranks amen you can you can see when the when the holy ghost began to fall and the gifts were restored what did it do it restored holiness it restored dress it restored amen a woman back to her position it did all of those things but go find one now they look back at that and says a bunch of old folkiness what caused that the presence of god falling down hallelujah amen if the presence of god causes a man a woman to dress right look right amen a man to do right what does what what causes the other thing relaxed drifting the cycle of revival and death has never failed it's come right into the ranks of the message amen all you have to do is recall there he goes the last move of god in the spirit when men and women dressed like christians went to church prayed all night took to the street corners wouldn't ashamed the manifestation of the spirit mercy sounds like he's calling out us message believers at this time he's talking about a pentecostal race they left their old dead churches worshiped in home and old store buildings they had a reality but it wasn't long until they began to get enough money to build find new churches they put a choir instead of singing in the god for themselves they put gowns on they organized the movement soon began to read books that wasn't fit to read they let down the bars and the goats come in and took over the cry of joy was gone the freedom of the spirit's gone and they kept on with a form but the fire has died down and the blackness of ashes is all that's about left but he said he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen we need to take heed to him and we do not know but he will lend his ear and want to know the words of the truth will feel the spirit of god enlighten him if your ears open to the word the spirit of god will reveal something to you amen it's a work of the spirit it'll teach you but notice in this in this one in this ephesian church age he said there's something brother branham keys in on he said notice it says that the spirit is speaking to the churches not just the ephesus church not just for the first age holy but this is for all church ages don't be drifting we can look through scriptures we'll go through some here as we go here deuteronomy 4 9 says take heed to thyself in other words don't come to church and say well that was for somebody else they you know that i whoa i know where that hit take heed to yourself and keep thy soul diligently he didn't they come to church and make sure everybody else's soul is right he said keep thy soul lest thou forget the things which sign eyes have seen unless they depart from their heart all the days of the thy life and luke 21 34 says take heed to yourself lest any time your hearts be overcharged with sophiety and drunkenness and cares of this life and that day come upon you unaware for it as a snare shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth amen when person sets a snare for a bird or for a bear whatever animal he's trying to catch he's not got signs pointing to it he's not you know what i mean it's not all out in the open it's the skies a lot of ways amen but what does a snare do when that animal steps into that point it slaps shut and before he knows it he's caught and this is exactly what the rapture is fixing to do to a lot of people that door that's been opened is about to shut amen he that is holy will be holy still amen he that is ungodly will be ungodly still amen we see people that are just going on like it's just any other day this is not just any other day isn't a time to have sincerity this is the time to have fervency this is a time to say god whatever is wrong in my life i want to make it right it's a time to let down let go of old family squabbles and things that has held you back it's the time to put it all in the blood and say god i don't want to be caught in the trap of laodicea ii peter says 1 says 19 says we have also a more sure word of prophecy wherein you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arrives in your hearts ii peter 1 1 says simon peter a servant of the apostle of jesus christ to them that obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace be unto you and grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceedingly great and precious promises oh hallelujah that by these you might be partakers of divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in this world through lust and besides that beside this giving all diligence all diligence add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge tempers tempers patience patience godliness god and his brother kindness brother kindness charity for if these things be in you impound they make that you neither be barren nor and fruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his own sins wherefore the brethren brother give diligence give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you will not fail hallelujah if you do these things you will take a body change if you do these things oh but i i got this to do brother timothy i i got if you do these things kind of like brother brown i'm talking about you know our body being worth so many cents and today that sense has went probably who knows how far into the dollars with inflation and everything else but he said somebody will worry about what they put on and you know and he said talks about going to a restaurant and said how if you dare find a spider in your soup you'll throw a fit you don't get all out of sorts because you've got some maybe what it is hair or whatever it is just get out all the sorts he said but then i'm saying people gone down everything the devil has amen just take whatever all his lies and all the things just take it right in as though amen listen it's time we give diligence to the things of god first corinthians 10 1 says moreover brethren i would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all past through the sea and we're all baptized unto moses and the cloud and the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat they'd all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be idolaters idolaters or some of them as is written the people sat down to eat drink and rose up to play amen neither let us commit fornication and some of them committed and failed one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed as serpents neither murmur you as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happen to them for examples and they are written for our monastery upon whom the end of the world will come wherefore let him that thinketh he stand take heed lest he fall it's only as an example you know people apparently are not convinced therefore they're not concerned if you was convinced this was the truth you would be concerned with having your house in order if you was convinced in the time that we're living in you'd be concerned about where you are as a father and a mother and daughters and sons if he was convinced amen matthew 24 37 says but as the days as the days of noah were so shall be also the coming of the son of man be for as in the days where both were before the flood they were eating drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and all of a sudden bam door closed brother aaron preached a wonderful sermon on the fence is empty if you hadn't listened to it you ought to go listen to it i'm pretty sure it's in the archives today we'll get it to you if it ain't archives he can preach it again people coming in just like a day like usual oh no he's out there doing the same thing again crazy guy but all of a sudden this day was different they come to the ark to do their making fun and they're carrying on and the door's shut it's going to be a day just like that day for these critics and people making fun all of a sudden they're going to come to the evening light website and it's shut they're going to come to other places and it's shut not by the government no brother brown said she won't be shut up she'll be taken up that's what i'm talking about that door be shut hallelujah amen i'm not worried and threatened about what the government's going to do they're already doing places called china they may read about those brothers in china it ain't stopped the ministry of god it's went forward with more zeal than ever what did he do when he tried to come and persecute the early church it spread them out with more zeal than ever the devil's going about like a roaring lion is only going to put more zeal in people let's get this work done let's get it over with let's find that last soul let's get out of here hallelujah the signs of the time are here it's going home time no not until the flood knew not unto the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be then shall two be in the field one shall be taken and the other left two women shall be grinding at the meal one shall be taken and the other left watch therefore watch therefore watch therefore in other words give strict attention get be cautious and active this is what this word means watch take heed lest through remission and indolence which is the avoidance of activity and exertion laziness some destructive calamity suddenly overtakes you so ins so to keep that from happening watch keep your eye upon him keep looking for his appearing amen make everything about that you're doing about him you're looking for him listen when you're looking for him you're not just looking for him to come in the skies of glory you're looking to him for every day to visit you're looking for him to come in your school rooms you're looking for him to fall in your car you're looking for him to fall in every service amen i don't think we should be complacent about our services we ought to be looking for him just like the woman who washed his feet she came there looking for him and when she found him she did something about it she fell at his feet and she worshiped the complacency was gone all the things about her was gone she said i have to get to jesus oh hallelujah if you will come with that same attitude you'll see him you'll see him in the songs you'll see him in the preaching you'll see him in the word of god going forth and delivering the sick and healing the eating the sick and the saving the lost you will see him and when you see him don't let complacency hold you back fall down in his feet and worship him do something about it when he comes watch know this that if the good man of the house had known and what watched the thief would come he would have watched and wouldn't have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be you also ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh blessed is that servant whom is lord when he cometh shall find so doing verily i say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his goods but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his servant his coming and shall begin to smite his fellow servants to eat and drink with the drunken the lord of that servant shall come in the day that he looketh not for him in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him a sunnah sunder and appoint him his portion with his with his portion with your hypocrites and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth luke 12 35 says let your loins be girded about and your lights burning amen oh hallelujah and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord hallelujah when he will return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocking they may open to him immediately that's the kind of people we want to be amen that we're fervent and when we're here is not we open the door you know brother brahm talked about that guy that was criticizing an artist about the picture of jesus on the outside knocking the man on the inside and he said the guy the critic said well you forgot something how can he open the door when there's no lights for him to open the door and he said well that's the whole mystery of this he said the latch was actually on the inside you have to take the latch and open the door amen you got to get beyond the complacency that's just another service or i got been this way all my life you know you got to open the door and say god i see you and i want you to do something for me come in unto me lord and he said if you open the door i'll come in and it should come to pass and if it shall come to pass let me go back up verse 37 blessed are those servants whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching same word an action amen not not lacks not lazy about the things of god but watching it's more than just looking it's an action it's kind of about like the word the your manner of conversation or it's your manner of living this watch is more than just two eyeballs looking at a piece of paper or a wall somewhere no it's an action you're in anticipation any time he's coming back when he comes in to se and if you come in the second watcher come in the third watch find them so blessed are these servants and to know that if the good man of the house had known what hour the thief would come he'd have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken that through so be be therefore ready also for the son of man cometh and an hour when you think not first corinthians 16 13 says watch ye same word watch ye be on guard stand firm in your faith stand firm in god respecting his precepts and keeping the doctrine that's been given to you stand fast in the faith and quit ye like men or in other words be mature and be courageous and be strong be like god called men watching first thessalonians 5 6 says therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they'd be drunk and are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober put it on the breastplate of faith and love for a helmet the hope of salvation for god has not appointed us to wrath oh hallelujah but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we shall live together with him first peter 5 8 says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil is a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour and he's desired of many write off message pews zephaniah would say it like this the word of the lord came to zephaniah this is about the end time he said i will completely consume and sweep away all things from the face of the earth and judgment says the lord i will consume and sweep away this amplified man and beast i will consume and sweep away the birds of the air the fish of the sea and the stumbling blocks the idols along with the wicked i will cut off and destroy man from the face of the earth declares the lord i will stretch out my hand in judgment against judah and against all the inhabitants of jerusalem i will cut off and destroy the remnant of baal from its place and the names and remember remembrances of the idolatrous priests along with the false priests and those who bow down and worship the host of heaven the sun the moon and the stars on the housetop those who bow down and swear oats and pretend to worship the lord did you hear that those who bow down and swear oaths and pretend to worship the lord and yet also swear by the pagan god called will come god of the amorites and those who have turned back from following the lord those who have not sought the lord as their most important need or inquired of him hush be silent before the lord god in other words there's no acceptable excuse to offer now for the day of vengeance of the lord is here for the lord has prepared a sacrifice he has set apart for his use those that have accepted his invitation then it will come about on the day of the lord's sacrifice that i will punish the princes and the king's sons and all who are clothed and lavished for and upheld reflecting their paganism mercy on that day i will also punish all those who leap over the temple threshold who fill their pagan lord's temple with violence in the sea on that day declares the lord there will be sound of crying from the fish gate and the northern wall of jerusalem where invaders enter and the wailing from the second quarter of the city and loud crashes from the hill well you inhabitants of morta and the merchants of canaan will be silenced and destroyed it'll come about at that time that i will search jerusalem with lamps and i will punish the men who are like old wine stagnant in spirit another one another translation says that are actually happy-go-lucky the same word complacent so complacent who say in their hearts the lord will not do good nor will he do evil the same ones that won't give honor to god when he heals sick give it all to the doctors the same one furthermore their wealth will become plunder their houses desolation they will build houses but not live in them plant vineyards but not drink their wine the great judgment day of the lord is here it is near and coming very quickly listen the day of the lord the warrior cries out bitterly that day is a day of the outpouring of the wrath of god it is a day of trouble and distress it is a day of destruction and devastation a day of darkness and gloom a day of clouds and thick darkness a day of trumpet and battle cries of invaders against fortified cities against the high corner towers i will bring distress on men so that they will walk like blind men unable to find a way of escape because they have sinned against the lord and their blood will be poured out like dust and trampled under foot and their flesh like dung neither their silver nor their gold will be able to rescue them on the day of the lord's indignation and wrath and the whole earth will be consumed in a fire of his jealous wrath for he shall make full and complete in indeed an unterrifying one for all the inhabitants of the earth it don't sound like a place i want to be their gold and silver ain't going to help them they'll draw up all kinds of ways to try to get us out of this problem it ain't going to work this nation is following the path of prophecy these people are following the path of prophecy total destruction and annihilation just as the word has says so it shall be amen there's people that's fulfilling prophecy of the prophecy of the of of solomon gomorrah right now we're just you know the new president just putting in the first transgender into an office i agree we're not a christian nation this nation started out as a lamb but she's speaking as a dragon and she's fulfilling it she's fulfilling every iota she's got to and this world's going to fulfill it and she's going to be burned people are going to die great calamities we've read come up on the earth it's going to happen it will be a terrifying one for the inhabitants of the earth i don't want to be there so if we see those people fulfilling a vision there's also another people fulfilling the vision hallelujah amen there was a church between two a church and a bride brother branham scene in a vision right seeing the bride come around the one time then the church came and he said about made him sick he couldn't said i can't even i don't even have the etiquette to describe it her dress and her manner of way it wasn't nothing to do with christianity no more totally gone stripped away from her he said i thought after all i've done this is what i've produced he said but all of a sudden the voice said and she'll come again and the bride came again marching and on with christian soldiers amen and he saw her take as she was going amen in the most beautiful guard dressed in the righteousness of jesus christ not our own righteousness amen but as we see this other church going down into demise down into hell and down into destruction there's also another church that's not going down she's going up and she's not going to be bound down by lukewarmness and the complacency of laodicea but there's going to be a fervent desire in there i've got to fulfill the prophecy that's spoken of me god spoke of me and i'm going to fulfill it [Music] hallelujah he spoke there will be healings i'm going to fulfill it he spoke that would be deliverances i'm going to fulfill it hallelujah and let me tell you prodigals out there there's prophecy over here and you will fulfill it hallelujah amen just as you see these things places something's going to move over here and say there's better in the father's house get out of the pigpen and go back to where you come from [Music] hallelujah amen that's why revelations 19 7 would say let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready this is not a woman that's complacent it is not a woman resting on her laurels of 50 years ago she's moving on in the supernatural she's moving over the steps with always christian soldiers she's walking to her destiny a body change a marriage supper brother branham would equate this to a little woman out west a little servant woman looked down on despised and rejected voted most likely to not succeed with no hope seemingly for but there was a man it was a mighty man of wealth out there in the east who had a heart he wanted to find him a wife so he goes out to where his ranch was where they supplied the cattle to the packing plant you know the story he went out there and he tried to find him a wife and he said brother ramsay boy they put on the shin dig they they dressed up they painted up they they done everything they could to get his attention they whistled over here and they wooed over there and they smoked lighted this and they've done that but yet god wasn't even wouldn't pay no attention he's looking for something else he's looking for a woman of character a woman that would stand by a woman that wouldn't run when the first problem came up amen and here he goes and he's looking and he ain't seeing it and he goes out one day well after we're doing a party and he walks outside and he he he uh he he walks out and he's just trying to get his mind wrapped around us i come out here i spent money i can't there's nobody out here all of a sudden here's a door creek and over there in the dimness of the light of the kitchen the door open and hear this little girl come out ragged the thing and didn't look like much she walked over there and she dumped the and she he began to walk he noticed and began to watch her begin to watch her attitude begin to watch what she was doing and you know and begin to watch her actions and how she was holding her holding herself and what she was doing so that's the woman i want he catches her out there one day to reveal himself to her and tell her you're who i want even when she wasn't looking for him he came looking for her [Music] you remember when god found you and your raggedness and seemed impossibilities to overcome and just servant slave mentality and wasn't aware you could ever be somebody but all of a sudden a tap come on your shoulder and said hey that's not who you are i want to marry you me could you imagine the shock came over that little girl's face he said yes i'm going to marry you and i'm going to come back in a certain season you're going to watch for these things to take place and when you see that begin to take place you be ready and she went back throughout her business and he left and went seemingly gone and everybody went on about his day as usual life as usual forgot all about him but not this little girl she was making herself ready she was doing everything she could to earn whatever dollar she could get to go and buy her a gown to put on it whatever she could do she she had to she had to just get in and put everything her whole heart was in this because she knew he had spoke to her and she was convinced therefore since she was convinced of the promise that he was coming back she was concerned enough to get herself ready and i believe there's a people on this face of this earth you knew you wasn't looking for god but god came looking for you and it gave you a promise he said i'll never leave you or forsake you i'm not going to leave you in this hell-bound world but i'm coming back for you and you're convinced enough about his promise that you're concerned enough to get yourself ready and whatever i got to do i'll lay aside every weight i'll lay i don't care what people say i don't care what anybody says about me they can call me holy roller they can call me pentecostal they call me all emotion they can call me whatever they want to but one of these days they're going to call me god they're going to come looking for me and i ain't going to be nowhere around come on somebody amen and she began to watch the signs that he told her about and as she sees it to come to the fulfillment people begin to laugh people begin to make fun you're crazy you're lunatic you don't made this all up you just think it's that way what do you mean that ain't no that ain't no fulfillment of vision hahaha but she heard the word you know what the problem was they didn't hear it come on now they didn't hear it if they would have heard it they'd have been there too amen if they listen this is what the problem is with people that are sitting on the mat and settle message pews and are now out there some of the worst critics and the worst devils there ever was why they never heard it it never reached down into their soul to anchor down somewhere but i've heard it i've heard the message and it's called me out of darkness into a marvelous light and i see the signs of his period and i'm out there being ready any moment i'm going

have somebody that gives their all back to him that makes a full surrender of their lives they become fully and totally committed they're people whose eyes are always appearing who can't wait for him to come back who gets so tired of this world and all that it brings so they're not planning on staying here anymore they're like the little armor girl they're getting their garment ready they're listening for the sound of the chariot amen god didn't spare anything for you let's give back our heart our soul or everything that we have known he gladly bore our burdens he did it all to take away my sin so i could stand before him without blemish without a spot what what a wonderful god and when i think that god himself not harry didn't send an errand boy and an angel but he came himself

of the world has come we're in the sixth vision just before the fire falls amen we saw it happen today a woman who brother branham said was in royal high purple i saw her dress that's why he thought it was a roman catholic church because that's her colors is purple in scarlet but he said she'd be a vice president or president or some great person she'd hold the nation in under full sway we're here we're here we're right here in repeat as brother branham told us mr kennedy would make his make a good president no doubt but he'd just make a way for catholicism to warm its way all in through and now it's in our supreme court now it's everywhere it's now holding the nation it doesn't matter if you're conservative or you're liberal they got their fingers on both sides do you realize what we're standing do you realize we're in a time where the delay is about over you know why the lord is delayed because for you and you and you and you and you and you and you the long-suffering of god waited in the days of noah and his long-suffering has been on account of you to give you an opportunity to come in amen because his table's gonna be full he's never named on the book he's not leaving a one behind amen he's not leaving a hook behind he's gonna bring him everyone here hallelujah but the delay is about overwhelm we've been in overtime for quite a little while amen the lord long suffering that's why the delay is [Music] but made know it's an evil sermon that keeps saying oh nothing's happening that still allows that complacency to rule their lives the fervency must be there a people that loves god like he loves them [Music] a people that he could say when he would write a scripture when he write in the laws thou shalt not shall not now and then he would say that's not what i want if i can just get somebody to love me with all their heart with all their soul with all that's within them that's what i want i want somebody to love me a bride a people called for his namesake and when christ shall come we shall [Music] evacuate [Music] oh yes think about it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] now [Music] oh how great you are
