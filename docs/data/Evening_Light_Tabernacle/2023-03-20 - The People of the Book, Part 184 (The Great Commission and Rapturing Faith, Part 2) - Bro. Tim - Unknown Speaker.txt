hallelujah amen that's the joy of our hearts too believe we'll be on that number amen I made reservations there hey man I got a new body waiting there we're gonna go marching in it's a promise of God [Music] just wanted to take a moment today is we just um begin this part of this service has already been mentioned about our brother Claude Sigmund passing away brother Claude and his wife sister Diana they came to sojourn with us probably a year and a half ago came here without any Fanfare very quietly moving here from Washington and took their place in the house of God and last Thursday brother Claude quietly went home to be with the Lord he made it clear during our hospital visits that he was ready to go and wanted to go to his Heavenly home that was his desire and God granted that we want to thank the Lord for the life and the testimony that brother Claude had I understand the some years ago now God came and gloriously saved him and delivered him and just changed his life we're glad for a testimony you know I I look out and see young people and a lot of our well many of our young people are gone this weekend and our Minister teams away and different ones are going here and there and so we're a little bit smaller number this morning but when I look out and I just see and I think what this message produces the kind of families it produces the kind of men it produces women marriages homes what is produced by this taking a man like brother Claude that was a a sinner didn't know the Lord and bring him to have his own experience and deliver him [Music] and I believe it was in one service I was told of or brother biscal just called him out and said brother Claude you know I don't remember the words but I'll just put it my own today's the end of your cigarettes and brought him up and had prayer for him and God gloriously delivered him you know he's that kind of God that takes sin and darkness out of our lives and redeems Us by his blood we can't live here forever we wasn't designed to live here forever God said okay if you're making this choice going into sin and you're going to be birthed into temporal bodies I'm gonna make sure it's temporary because you're not going to live like this forever and this is when you look at yours you're on fleshed today and you just realize it's only a temporary home and the preparations you're making right now is for an eternal home there are things that are to be Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also that place is more than a mansion with a gold knob and my beautiful Exquisite Palace always much more than that why you could be an old arthritic King in the king's Palace crippled up unable to eat anything and grasping your last breath what would that mean to us but he said I want to prepare a place for you through the new birth I'm giving you I'm preparing you to be born into another body so you know with us there are three births we birth first into this flesh then we're born again that happens to the soul and then we one day will be birthed into a new body death is only the birth Pains of it struggles and men women go through you know thankfully brother Claude didn't have to go through it long I mean Came Upon Us cannabis a surprise working there as a side job there Ace Hardware walking 35 miles a week or so you know seemed to be doing well and thought he had a little allergy checks in the ER from there to ICU and we keeps going he didn't have to linger long some people go through a lot long long birth pains to be born into another body but God was gracious he ended his time of suffering here and we got to remember God's that kind of gracious God it isn't that he snatches our loved ones away from us and just rips him out of our arms no he comes and takes them from the snares and the clutches of sickness and pain and death and sorrow so let's just bow our heads for a moment as we remember brother Claude and ask God's blessings upon his wife and families got two children that live up in Washington and Canada may God bless them today as they think of their loss but may they also make preparations to meet him in a better land [Music] Lord sometimes in life's journey there's a little tear of sadness that comes maybe sometimes many tears we've all had our times of Sorrow troubles this life is few days and full of troubles our brother Claude you let him make his three score in ten and there he is today a young man on the other side you went to prepare a place for him you received him to yourself Lord we thank you Father for the power of the blood of Jesus it cleanses a man from sin and Washington white as snow and Lord and then welcomes him into the kingdom as a son as a child Lord we thank you for brother Claude his testimony his love for you and we'll always remember his his smile and the greetings they could give us the love that he shared with others I pray that you'll Comfort his wife sister Diana and or his children and encourage them today to make their plans to meet him in a better land I asked the Lord did for us as we kind of just dropped the belt just a little tighter knowing Lord that that's the way it's going to be no matter how much faith and power and miracles and things that you do and you do them but yet even right until the end there will be a few that will go right up by the way of the Grave only to come up in just a few minutes to go into the great resurrection and rapture until then Lord the cycle of death continues and but one day Lord it'll all be over and we look forward to that now I said Lord you'll give us strength to press on the battle in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you I want you to get ready to play that song when the redeemed or gathering in I want to sing at least several verses of that amen Lord I want to be in that number we sung a while ago but we're also going to be with the redeemed that are gathered in now there won't be a service for brother Claude um except over in May they'll have something private for him and his family um at a later time so uh just remember them in prayer but let's press on Amen amen let's let's think of the Rapture this morning let's look away from this to the Rapture I am thinking of the Rapture in our blessed I [Music] [Applause] I [Music] [Applause] [Music] watched like snow again [Applause] [Music] our God already oh what music music [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] for every day [Music] [Applause] well the clap was good maybe I'm missing everybody in the mezzanine maybe I'm missing my whole group of young people that usually are sitting up here I want to hear that song in a real Pentecostal way now come on you can do that amen let's sing it together give me the third verse and I'm gonna sing that and I want you to just raise your voice loud and clear clear and strong we're the redeemed how many believe you over there today amen well I sing it like we're the redeemed all right thanks will sing Redemption story with their voices clear and strong whether it is [Applause] [Music] every day I will shout and I will say every day that would be amen hallelujah amen we're being gathered now as a bridegroom call Goes Forth amen we so looking forward to the Gathering there in that other dimension amen we may be speaking about some of that this morning but let's let's turn to Genesis 18 verse 10 for scripture reading I'm going to continue the thought on the Great Commission and and Rapture in faith and we're going to read this scripture where he said and I I was certainly returning to thee according to the time of life and loathe Sarah thy son shall that wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent which was behind him I want to let you be seated be making your way over to Mark 16 I got a couple of more scripture readings to make here but we'll look in the 15th verse there as we looked here in the setting of The Prophecy laying in Genesis we saw God was standing there in dust that he had gathered and made himself a body and now God Appears to him he actually eats while he's there he's hungry he eats he is fed his feet are washed he is entertained and and so as he's there he has a commission for Sarah to bring forth the promised son and in this commission he promises a return and in this return there has to be a change in her mortal body in order to receive this promised son or otherwise a 90 year old woman cannot bring forth this child so she has to return back to me in the bride that she was when she was married a young young girl but this time now just change back young again but the problem fixed right and God's not going to just change us back young again but the sin question and every evidence of it will be gone so now we look here um again and we see God once more takes on human flesh and here he is now born in a manger he comes into his ministry the Bible tells you it is the word made flesh so he's god-spoken word The Original Seed he's made flesh again it's the son of man what do we mean by that it is that God has come and wrapped himself in dust and and the Flesh of a man and God came in Christ that way he was ever bet a man yet he was God and so the fullness of God of the godhead bodily dwelt in him never said he dwelt into godhead it says that the godhead dwelt in him he was the fullness of the godhead bodily now he again is giving um his parting words to the church and his final instructions that we have read from Mark 16 which is the Great Commission Sarah receives a commission now again we have um the disciples given a commission and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved that he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall they depends on the sick and they shall recover now we're going to go to the Book of Revelation and we're going to see now again a mighty angel coming down from heaven a mighty angel had come down from God out of Heaven to and wrapped himself in flesh and he would appear to now um uh to Abraham and Sarah there at the tent God again the pre-incarnate Christ also known as the pillar of fire the angel of the Covenant would wrap himself in human flesh would appear to Sarah are now to the excuse me the disciples and um just as he had to seren Abraham except now it was God himself the fullness of God manifest in flesh now in Revelation 10 we see again Christ coming down this is not the physical return of Christ because it is one who puts his foot on the land and on the sea so it's not a 1800 foot tall Jesus with a big foot over here and a Bigfoot over there there but this is symbolic of what he is doing as he comes down this time I want you to understand he does not come like he did in the days of Sodom by gathering 16 elements and wrapping himself in flesh and and walking and appearing to a seren Abraham neither does this time he come and and form himself in the womb of a woman and and wrap the dust around the spoken word seed and the out comes the Son of God but this time the blood has so redeemed man and has cleanse man that God is now coming down in human flesh and he will use now in this passage he will come here and flesh but he will use the vehicle of a son of man not the son of man a son of man a prophet and that Prophet will will speak the voice of God even as Jesus was the voice of God and even as um the the Angels standing the angel Lord standing there to seren Abraham was the voice of God we would again in this last day hear from a prophet to whom the word of the Lord would come to as I said he would not be the son of man he would be a son of man that means he is a prophet or if we can say a son of man that literally means um a son of dust and that God would again use the lips of a man to bring a message in the last say but it would be the same angel the same Mighty Angel the pre-incarnate Christ that was there in the days of Abraham and then the Incarnate Christ in the days when Jesus walked now the Holy Spirit coming the same Angel the same Pillar of Fire now speaking through a prophet in this last day but I I want you to see that it doesn't end there that it continues on with the same Angel The Mighty angel coming down with the open book and a people then given voice to that and actually they too are the manifestation of the son of man Christ upon the Earth so as we would look now the mighty Angel does not leave amen the mighty Angel comes down to uh and when I say he doesn't leave I mean he doesn't leave with a prophet coming he he actually comes down he puts his feet a feet on the land and the Sea this is all symbolic remember even the Bible tells you that Christ is ahead of the church but his church is his body and that every devil is under your feet so if you're noticing the cloud is or even the cloud in 1963. it didn't show a body it showed a head in the heavens because God has a body on Earth and it is through that body that he has taken possession and holding down the powers of Hell the the Beast that rises up out of the land where there is no people that has rose up there's a power that rises up out of America where there was not not a populist people and over here another Beast has risen up out of the sea which says multitudes and and kindreds and tongues and people which is wrong and so the feet are are now placed on both of these because of the blood of Jesus Christ and the opening of the book gives us authority over the devil so I want you to I want you to see by receiving the Divine inheritance it gives us authority over the devil now so if you'll look with me in Revelation 10 1 we're going to read this chapter and again here in lies the last Commission Now to the church as it comes and we are also commissioned now and and in Revelation 10 and 1 and I saw another Mighty angel now this could only be Christ he is the Angel of the Covenant because he is clothed with the cloud a rainbow the full Covenant the sign of the Covenant is upon his head his face is as it were the son so his countenance is now is the fullness of the word coming and his feet as pillars of fire and remember who are his feet amen even if you're just a skin on his feet every devil is beneath you amen and notice he had it in his hand a little book open in the in Revelation 5 it was closed but the lamb had taken the book now the lamb didn't need the book as almighty God he had the book so he comes for it now and he takes the book out of him that sat on the throne because he comes as a lamb now God's not wants to make you understand there's not two Gods there or neither two persons of God there because God or the person of God is not a lamb the lamb represents represents Christ in his redeeming work so he has seven horns and seven eyes he's a very strange looking lamb nothing there like this has ever been seen on the earth because it is symbolic of the Christ who will redeem a people through Seven Ages which represent the seven horns with seven seers which are seven prophets of God [Music] amen now these will be messengers of God that spoke of in the Book of Revelation so now as we look at it here it is Christ his faces his countenance his face is as it were the son and his feet as pillars of fire this is he's not veiled he's not closed off amen he's nothing is hidden everything is coming forward this is the fullness of his glory his word now coming and as the word comes it's going to come to the prophet watch and he said it he had in his hand a little book open he said his right foot on the sea is left foot on the earth and he cried or he shouts with a loud voice so let's understand now this is the shout of his coming we'd always speak of the coming of the Lord and many denominational people believe that it happens in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we do not believe that we believe our change takes place in a moment in a twinkling of an eye but we believe that coming of the Lord is a process there has to come the restoration of the word in order to produce a bride because he can't marry the he can't marry her daughters and there's nothing bound of him so therefore there has to be a word brought that will create a bride calling her out from the all the world to himself amen so there again as we're looking at it he cries or he shouts with a loud voice as when a lion roar this is a king speaking this is a voice of authority and when it when he cried so when he shouts during his message seven Thunders utter their voices now John is watching all of this he is seeing a scene since he has been caught up in Revelation 4. he has already seen the seven churches he has seen the Seven Cities representing seven churches and seven stars in the hand of Jehovah which represents seven Messengers now he is looking here and and he's caught up in Revelation 4 and he sees the throne one sits on the throne he sees the scenes of The Throne Revelation 5 breaks it and he sees now the same changes as it comes into Redemption because here there was God who held the book this was the book that Adam lost Adam once had the right to eternal life all right but because of sin he lost his inheritance Satan's dirty hands couldn't take it amen so it went back in the hands of almighty God is a question document until there could be a man come to take the book now that man could not be William Branham the man could not be John Wesley the Jolly the man could not be the Apostle Paul the the man could not be Isaiah or Jeremiah or Elijah or Enoch there is no man that was worthy every man had been born in sin shaping iniquity come in the world speaking lies and none of them could take that book no man was worthy to even look on the book but now in Revelation 10 by that time something has happened a man has come in possession of the book because it screamed out as any man worthy in Revelation 5. so now it was looking for a worthy man and out of the midst of the throne came around this lamb represents God coming as a man to be the sacrifice to pay for man's sin and he was the only one worthy to take the book not when he takes the book remember he has not taken it for himself he was never lost but he's taking it as a man for man and in Revelation 10 once he has opened the book and then he comes down with the open book to deliver it to the people that's why we're preaching on the people of the buck now I don't know if you can fully grasp where we're living at but we are in a very awesome moment in time now when he shouts he shots with a loud voice that's when a lion roarth and when he cried or shouted seven Thunders uttered their voice so when this message is going forth seven Thunders utter their voices now what is the thunder a thunder is When God Says something and he doesn't want it known yet because it's for another age and for another time all right but it's the voice of God but we don't know what he said so we can go back to the days of Daniel and we can look back up in the in the and on the handwriting on the wall many many tackle you Farson God said something nobody knows what it means the The Magicians come out God said something we don't know what it means everybody's guessing well we think it means this and we think it means that we've had it for 2 000 years Scholars books written until you can line the theology halls with books that would probably go around the world of men's ideas until we have created over 40 000 different denominations and none of them are right not one of them not one of them and no Theologian had the right because it doesn't ever come to theologians Amos 3 and 7 says surely the Lord God will do nothing except it Reveals His secrets to his servants of prophets so now we have it here where that that that again we know it will have to be a prophet that will reveal it so this is what they came to and that day said yeah well you know all of you are guessing but let's bring the prophet on the scene there's Daniel call him up Daniel comes up and he says here's what it means now it weighed in the balance in your found warning so now we have the interpretation you see before we just had a mysterious writing that nobody understood but now when the prophet comes We Now understand what was once mysterious is now revealed are you with me now so again we have here a same thing something uttered we have no idea what it is so again we have the end there when as it does when the seven Thunders uttered their voices verse 4 I was about to write John said I was going to write what was said and he said I and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not seven Thunder Seven Seals seven sealed up Mysteries that are not going to be made known now John you can't tell it this has something to do with the end time people it has something to do with my coming and I'm gonna hold it mysterious I'm going to hold it mysterious because if I let you know and this is why I'm writing this book of Revelation I'm not writing it in Parables or symbols as seven churches and Seven Stars and seven angels and you know seven golden candles all these symbolic things is parabolic and nobody understands it you see because it wasn't for them to know it is not their book it is your book Hallelujah it is when God unveils himself and he says now if I let them know in the first age that it's going to be Seven Ages later or two thousand years then nobody will be ready you know you know how men are oh the Lord's not coming to win uh 2000 after 2023 well no need to evangelize no need to get in a hurry no need to get the gospel out no need to fulfill the Great Commission no need we got a lot of time what didn't happen in our generation nobody would have died ready but God held that a secret because he wanted Paul expecting and and he left them expecting even though he gets a revelation of the Rapture the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with his child and the voice and the trumpet all of this and dead in Christ shall rise and comfort one another with these words and you know you know you know don't don't sorrow as far as them that are asleep and he says you know we which are alive and remain we nothing God held that secret to him I'm not going to let you know Paul when I'm coming back because there are more in the book than you and I've got to wait on and I've got to intercede until the last one 's name is dipped in blood hallelujah amen brother Roger he couldn't have come 10 years ago amen he had to wait till your name was dipped in blood amen you see he's been it's been waiting on you to arrive and finally the last ones the last names on the book are manifested on the Earth and when it does God says okay in that age I'm gonna make it known so he says seal up those things the thunder-suttered and right them not and the angel which I saw stand on the sea and upon the Earth lit it up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever you know this is language that same thing that happened that did in Abraham's day God lifted up his hand and swore with an oath concerning the seed that was coming and so God does the same thing he swears by him that liveth forever and ever who created heavens and earth the things that therein are the Earth the things that therein are the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer that doesn't mean we taught us wristwatch away that would pull the clock off the wall that we no longer use a calendar that means that there that that I'm making a promise that there will come a time there will come a day when there will be no more delay of holding back this promise I swear I'm not going to leave it like this forever but I'm going to bring it down to an end time people who will know their God who will do exploits so he comes down and he says and then he explains why he said it won't be always delayed but now remember but is uh is an incomplete sentence but but I'm going to town what but I'm going home but Michael's a pretty good guy you wonder what I said about him before that don't you amen there was something said before that what was said what was said that said there's coming a time this will not be delayed hold it up don't write it seal it up there are seven seals it's got to be revealed nobody knows them it's written in symbols there's a white horse red horse black horse Pale Horse all of this and nobody knows what to mean everybody's guessing theologians are writing books about it but nobody knows and it's going to remain that way you know but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared his servants the prophets so God has declared there's coming there's a time when the seventh angel sounds the mystery will be finished so he doesn't leave it there that we remain in this state forever there actually comes a time where there is a people to whom the seven Thunders are revealed what God said that he didn't want other ages to know so he says in verse 8 and the voice which I heard from Heaven speaking to me again and said go and take the little book now the one who heard from heaven was the angel said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the the Sea and the Earth and I went to the angel and I said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it up and eat it take it and eat it up and it shall make that belly bitter but shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth's sweet as honey and as soon as I'd eaten my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations and tongues notice the last Commission and it's the same as the first Commission the first commission was going to all the world the last commission says it you must prophesy again go into all the world and preach this one says preach it demonstrate it before many peoples Nations tongues and kings now we spoke last Sunday of the coming of the son of Mount and the pre-incarnate Christ as Sarah to fulfill the Great Commission given to Abraham which had not been done Abraham at this time has a son it is Ishmael but the bombs woman child did not fulfill it nor could he ever fulfill it and neither has denominations fulfilled the Great Commission and the promised son which comes at the end that promised son has not come even today we are looking for that promised son to come back is that right the coming of the Lord Jesus now as of 1965 at the end of brother battle's Ministry he was still saying the Great Commission had not been fulfilled and all scriptures must be fulfilled we are living in a very a very tumultuous time we are as it as it was in the days of Noah and we are as it was in the days of Sodom so we have the evil of all ages now coming in together the one that would be drowned by water the other that would be by that would be destroyed by fire and sin is magnified itself and heaped up against this generation both of these times were when God destroyed as we said one by water the other by fire and both times there were a people saved amen before the destruction in Noah's day Enoch was raptured he was the seventh from Adam we are here now like Enoch the seventh from the second Adam so he again we in the seventh age is when God takes some people in a rapture and and of course Noah was a type of the 144 000 who were sealed in passing through the Judgment Waters into the Millennium remember the the foolish virgin the Gentile Remnant they go through the tribulation they die but they wait until the thousand years is finished to be resurrected and that white Throne judgment they are given life but but the Jews will be there in the Millennium with us at 144 000 because they are the remnant of the Bride the leftover of the Old Testament and so in the days of Sodom we also see lot was saved from fire he was a righteous man which is a type of tribulation Saints and Abraham who was who the angel stayed with revealing the mysteries of giving the promise of the coming son if you have noticed in the days of of Abraham the promised son was promised in the days of Enoch he had a message how many knows what that message was in the book of Jude said that that Enoch said the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his Saints so in its message was the coming of the Lord amen amen the message to Abraham was the coming of the promised son our message come on is the message of the coming Sun the Rapture of the church so here we are following and fulfilling all prophecy all scripture that has been prophesied of this last day now wake your neighbor up because I don't like speaking to sleeping virgins let's get together and understand you know God's trying to impart some things to you today this is for you this this could not be preached in Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostal churches this is only for the bride if you're not interested maybe you're identifying Who You Are but let me just say again you know again where we're at in the in time you know we we see it was there before the burning of Sodom that Sarah a 90 year old woman she receives strength to bring forth a child because she had received the message of the Angel and she judged him faithful who had promised now it is that body changing strength that we're needing today amen amen of faith for the rapture amen oh yes that's what we need today you're going to look over at your neighbor and and say I and just admit it I need Rapture and faith amen I have the faith to be saved I'm filled with the Holy Ghost but I need faith for my body change now in the message countdown brother Bradham is praying he said father so many things could be said right here maybe the church wouldn't understand but I pray that she'll give them such a crave for it Lord that's my prayer for you today too give us a crave for it that they'll come and see we're at the end time the astronaut age I pray father that they'll realize it isn't trying to condemn what they had it's only to give them more Rapture and Grace for the hour will come when we'll have to have Rapture power not only to heal the body but to change it in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and Christ will be so real in their bodies till he can change it by his death by his great death what he purchased think of that Christ's being so real in your mortal body aim until he can change it to change the change is going to take place from the inside out the same Holy Ghost just the fresh baptism of it Hallelujah you ought to be looking at your own experience today and saying God give me a progression in my walk let me be like Enoch that I come up to the point of crossing the dimensions between Earth and Heaven to where I'm translated in a moment in a twinkling of an eye amen it was a progressive walk and you got to look at your own walk as a progression and have a crave have a crave for this word a desire a burning desire that's been to be God according to your word somebody's going to fulfill this May today he said that this token hold it before them and walk into this astronaut granted father were visions and powers and worlds Beyond known and God were all the seven Mysteries is unfolded and those Seven Seals is made known to man now so again he said again he said let them walk into this astronaut we'll let them walk into Christ let them progress into Christ let him move let him outside such a craving to leave this world brother Brandon would preaching things that are the peace you're craving things here mama I would have to give up this and quit that and whatever because it was a baby being formed in her womb and and she had cravings because it was needed for the forming of that body I'm telling you church that theophany is calling you this morning and that should be a craving down on the inside of you hey man give up the world get up sin give up Darkness let it all go crave the right things decide God with all your heart search with everything look in the scripture to see what's been prophesied

and move into my body let the Christ that would reveal the word the Christ that would discern the heart the Christ that could transform Sinners and to say let him come and be revealed in this flesh I don't know we're living in a very treacherous time and I feel a very warning down in our hearts it's not an hour to play Church it's not an hour to get cold and stuck she is not an hour it's not an hour to just just be a church member it's time you move in time you move in with all your heart that's why we call on you you know worship God whether you are or whether in the front or all the way to the back let's get in one Accord let's create an atmosphere let's see the Holy Spirit step into step into lives the mighty Angel come down into you we need the mighty Angel to step down on us to give us power over the cancer and Ron Spencer's life cancer and Erica Parker's life amen the cancers and people's lives and hearts and dysfunctional families and every other thing come on church amen we need the son of man to step into US let his voice be heard amen left to be a prophesying again you're prophesied in the prophet yes it prophesied in William Branham but it's your time to speak it let us step into this astronaut we're visions and Powers worlds Beyond world's known and oh God where these great mysteries of God is unfolded in those Seven Seals and made known to man I just pray God give us a reality of what you've done in this hour and are doing now we have been challenged to believe brother Branham would would challenge us he says in the trial I challenge you okay is there people that will that can step up to that challenge I mean he was challenging Sarah to believe is there anything too hard for the Lord I I understand the insurmountable things that you can't change I understand you can't make yourself young again you can't have milk veins again you can't have the womb again and you've always had this problem but I challenge you to believe I'm telling you to believe that you a 90 year old woman when it's impossible that you can receive body changing faith I'm telling you Church it wasn't Sarah it was rapturing Grace that was coming to her that's what we need this morning and that's what God's poured out in this day is rectory favor when you were a sinner when you were lost when you had nothing to do with it God sent a message and God in his grace is a party Faith to a people to believe and brother Branham says I challenge you I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the former son of man in human flesh through the bride's body you can believe it was done through the prophet's body you can believe that it was done through Sarah's body you can believe it's done through Abraham you can believe it's done in Jesus well don't you know that to have a wife then that Christ has got to be manifested in Bride form there has to be a people in His image a super race that as he nears him a super church with a super anointing with a perfect faith with someone with a people like Sarah who quit quit looking at their own symptoms their own problems their own limitations their own failures and they judge him faithful who made the promise amen listen churchy you better somebody's going to do it look where we are in time I mean look at the evils in the line look at Sodom and Gomorrah look at Noah's day look at the calamities everywhere look where we are and somebody's got to be judging him and saying but God you're a faithful God you're a faithful God you said you'd have a bride she would be without spot or wrinkle I don't know how you're gonna do it I don't know how you'll even do it with me I know it'll take great grace but Lord you provided Grace in the evening today you provided Grace in Sarah's day you provided Grace for Mary you can provide that Grace for me I need that favor Divine favor and Grace it ain't gonna be even because of you it's going to be because of him amen amen I just recognized you God bless you good to have you in the house of the Lord today with us a sister a sister that great grace came down upon her life and delivered her from an awful serpent bite hallelujah amen and God is rich in Mercy what a great God we serve amen god-given faith in this day and hour to cast Satan out so a daughter of God could be delivered where is that Mighty angel where is that son of man today he's present to empower Sarah crowner with a perfect faith for a perfect rapture not just a faith but a perfect faith people have had Faith down to the ages but you're required in perfect faith brother Branham would preach the sermon perfect faith what's what he said now he appeared to us in the same form as he did to them in the Old Testament and in the same as he did in the New Testament and it showed by the same word the same Christ and I declare to you that Christ is the holy ghost that where Christ means the anointed one and just a person that is Anointed that's the Christ the anointed one how many knows that's true that's the that's the interpret the anointed one that there would be a man that would be anointed anointed by what the Bible said in Acts 2 that Jesus and Nazareth a man approved of God anointed by the Holy Ghost went about and done great works and things see that God manifested prove that he that he is in this man and we become Anointed with that same spirit anointed Messiahs Messiahs of this last day to sign forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show that he's not there but he's in the form of the Holy Ghost and he is in his people moving among his bride with a love affair to her pouring out into her himself and to becoming one for the wedding supper and the great same signs promised by the same God in the same word is making his same manifestation and there's nothing left for us to do but believe it [Applause] Hallelujah nothing left for you to do but let's believe it God said I'm going to do this amen that's his grace upon you I feel to tell you sister that Grace is still upon you this morning that Grace that delivered you is that same Grace that will meet your needs as you come in this house this morning and answer the desires of your heart Hallelujah another Messiah the spirit of the Lord is upon me for he hath anointed me and that same spirit is upon his bride Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord [Applause] Hallelujah as God promised Sarah restoration necessary to bring forth Isaacs so God has sent a spirit and he used dust human flesh to bring us a message he could have chose the Stars the Sun the moon he could but he chose men to bring his word through sending a prophet but that's who the word comes through God chose to gift him to vindicate him first first he sent with gifts to prove he's from God and then and then the the first was healing the second phase of this ministry was prophesying Discerning of the thoughts and intents of heart and I'm talking about the messenger of Malachi 4 now brother Branham the the seventh angel God sent a prophet first to vindicate him with healing and then after that healing discernment amen Discerning the harps God still does that he still does that he knows exactly how to do that he still discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart amen Amen Let me let me just say this little sister was in the in the floor she'd been went from church to church one gun eating Deliverance there a demon Spirit had rebounded and there in Youth Camp she wallowed on the floor but God gave a word that delivered her and she still delivered still set free amen why because of saints and a man is still working in his church did by the angel the cast out Devils that speaks with new tongues that kills the sick he's still the same God refreshing himself yet bright form [Applause] let me go back over this one more time I don't know how much of this message I'll get through maybe a part three to it it's already went totally different than what I thought I never expected to go through and break down every part of Revelation 10 and all of that for you but just following the leadership of the spirit of God to let it direct to you so you will catch it to give you a crave for the Hunger for it this message there is revealing it's Christ The Mystery of God to be aware in bright form [Applause] God and his people notice when he would as I said he could choose the Stars the Moon the Sun but he chose men to bring his word through God but in this day use a prophet and he would choose to gift him to vindicate him first was signed said he would set from God in fact to the matter is Gordon Lindsay would write the book A man sent from God they criticized brother randomly the same people now and say oh he made himself a prophet and he made himself John the Baptist no they said he was a man sent from God it was their prophets that rose up and spoke in tongues and interpreted and said this that this ministry was a Ministry to forerun the second coming of Christ ask John the Baptist so well brother Brandon made himself a light said no even the Pentecostal prophets declared he was Elijah even Gordon Lindsay said he's like John a man sent from God came in the spirit and the power of Elias the first was healing second phases Ministry was prophesying Discerning the thoughts and into his heart thousands upon thousands of times and never fail him as in Sarah's day the Lord stood there wrapped in dust I can remember and I'm really not that old I'm one of these young people that stayed with me I thought I'd be by myself thank you boys for staying home with me no I would have loved for you to be in the youth meeting that had been great but then I'd have had to go but in Sarah's day the Lord stood there wrapped in dust and as I said I stood there as a young boy and seen a prophet turn around and call people out in the audience saying as it was in the days of Sodom and tell them that they're behind my back like it was when the angel stood there the same Angel is now here is using my flesh and my voice to speak to you and that man there has this problem and that problem and that's his name and that's her name what was it it was God showing us a sign that the son of man was present that the word had come and it was coming to a prophet and he shows a sign to Sarah in the tent behind him where is Sarah calls her name where is Sarah thy life in the tent well listen listen that's what I do she'll have a son she got Chuckles there silently in her tent and he said why did she laugh she just laughed at what I said she denied it no I I didn't laugh because she was afraid the prophet of God said God would have killed her right there for lying in the play in the face of Jehovah God actually calling him a liar saying no I didn't laugh and he said oh yes she did you laughed you know and he said you know saying shall I an old woman have a child said that in her heart and he said you laughed in your heart and he said you know but but is there anything too hard for the Lord look look Grace immediately overruled her unbelief you come in that rapturing Grace church amen when you fail to believe when you stumble along the way with God's extract your name off he takes because you are part of Christ and he saw you in him before the foundation of the world and nothing not even God can wipe your name off of the Lamb's Book of Life not one thing you did or could do could wipe you off of the Lamb's Book of Life [Music] and even in your stumbles even in your weakness even in your failures Grace over rights it hallelujah amen oh my you realize it never was you seeking God it was God seeking you every time it was God came looking for you Grace [Applause] amen when you didn't know how to look and when you didn't know where to look Grace came down and found you [Applause] yes he saw your sinner yes he saw you with problems yes he saw you with failure but he left you anyhow and said I called you in ordained you even when you were in your mother's womb actually before the foundation world I called you in ordained you to be a part of my pride that's Grace [Applause] everything as Sarah and Sarah's day the Lord stood there wrapped in dust that's why we call him son of man of dust stood before her tent called her name discern the thoughts of her heart when she laughed at the words of the angel and that's a discernment God spoke to Abraham showing him the Mysteries I want you to get this Genesis 18 17. what they had just him blazing your heart this morning he comes and appears in disappearing I want you to notice he preached he tells of a rapture or a body change of the promised son and notice now what he says they hear he says shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I do in other words here I'm gonna unveil the Mysteries to him I'm gonna give him I'm gonna impart Revelation if you see it was more than just giving a promise he was in party the mysteries of God shall I hide from him the thing which I do oh we're in the third phase of the prophet's Ministry which is the opening of the word in the anointed ones at the end time brother Branham tells us and he says this in several parts he said the message speaks of his message not when I started out in the Divine Healing but when I begin to declare when he began to declare his message you see the first Paul healing second pull prophesying third pull opening of the word the Mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order than to reveal the words and Prophets and the only way a prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third poll was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the Hidden Truths that's been sealed in the word so let's catch it for a minute let's say make sure nobody misses brother Branham calls it third pull first pull second pull what's he talking about he'd had a vision he had a vision there of him fishing in a in a a big beautiful Clear Lake in there he saw rainbow trout great big trophy ones rainbow remember it's a symbolic Vision it's a vision of symbols he's fishing which represents his ministry he's making cast to catch which is preaching the word and as he is doing it there he sees fish there that that he he wants to catch he said you know there was he looked around and there was a bunch of ministers and they were catching little bitty fish but he said I wanted to catch that Covenant people the people of the Covenant the fish of the Covenant I I wanted to catch them I wanted to get that trophy you know every ages wanted to bring the trophy amen and Elizabeth caught a little fish wasn't growed up yet Wesley caught up a little fish he wasn't grown up yet but he said I want those that are alive and remain at the coming of the Lord that that trophy people that people that will be the bride that were at Pentecost was showing the full colors of the rainbow I want them to have every bit of the word in power I want to catch that that's what I want to catch let that be the trophy of my Ministry and the angel comes and says let me teach you how to fish and he says he said what you do he said his cast way out into the deep he said now you make that first little Paul and he said that will attract little fish lots of little fish and that was what his first Ministry did you talk about entertaining it was in a tendency blind eyes open cripples walk hey you'd run you'd you'd sleep out on your car to watch all of that get be in their first get on the first Pew you wouldn't give it up you'd get you a sandwich and sit there day and night they did it's quite entertaining it got a lot of little fish but it didn't produce the Covenant people amen so again you know they had a lot of people that came and with big crowds well you know big crowds big money that's what the evangelists would later find out oral Robertson and all of them you know they say well we know when it's time it wasn't Robertson said this but one of them would say you know we know when it's when it's time for us to leave a city said when we've taken up the offerings and then finally we stood them up on their head and pulled them up and down and shook them to all the chains fell out of their pockets then we knew it was time to move on to the next one it became about numbers and money and God says I'm going to give you a greater gift and one day in Regina Canada he had seen it by a vision before there come my person walks up to him and this time instead of the sign in the hand he knew her name knew her address knew where she's from what her trouble was there was nothing hidden now it was discerning and you know what the results was there were fewer people ministered to so you know what second police said would scatter them and it did his meetings got smaller there were fewer people came they would still have him because of his signed gift to show discernment it was a great thing but you know because there were less miracles and less people ministered to there was less healings so fewer people started coming you know fewer people were coming now I'm just going to say if that listen listen when I was there in 65 brother Brandon still had the sign in his hand he can still take somebody with his left hand and them there by by their hand give me that hand right there and hold it there and there on his only his hand would go bumps that would start moving if there was a uh if there was a germ disease in there it would start moving little white bumps and he could tell by the way that it moved and the rapid and the distance what kind of disease it was that sign was still there what am I telling you he still had the ability to go back to the first sign with more people more money bigger crowds come on greater popularity but he kept showing this other sign of discernment and brother Brandon said himself I wondered why this sign was greater than the first sign because the age of God said it was greater why was this and greater he said you know that the wheelchair zipped him out and and all the sick people being here why was this a greater sign when there was less people ministered to and less Miracles because he said it was a sign that the son of man of Christ himself the word was present [Applause] and God was given Witness come on Church give him witness at the same one that stood there in the day of Peter and said I your your name is cephas you're the son of Jonas I'm going to call you Peter amen called he said that the others call the woman at the well when she'd leave her pots after being told of her life all these other days listen discern the heart what was it it was shown it's the ministry of Christ was repeating again for a former rain to come as a teaching Reign to bring back the way to us and he said I wondered why that was great let me tell you if this would have been A.A Allen either or oral Robert said it went back to that first gift in heartbeat because it was all about if you ever watched oral it was all about the man of the hour if you ever watch the island men got into Spears they didn't even belong until they become drugs and alcoholics and here God sent a prophet and all these impersonators follow all Roberts would go forth and plant the seeds of Pentecostalism until there is 0.6 billion of them today but he said the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the Hidden Truths that's been sealed in the word the third pull was the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed it would be that which would catch it would be that hook that would catch the Covenant people so brother Branham you know went out and and in the vision you remember what happened you know he came cast out and the angel said don't tell nobody what you're doing and they come along and they pat him on the back and the minister said brother Bradham ain't nobody no nobody a fisherman like you are you're the greatest this and that patent him on the back and said you can do it brother Branham and he got excited and made the pull when he wasn't supposed to he caught a little fish like the rest of them but he was told the third pull will catch the Covenant people the third phase of his ministry which is rejected the one the face the faces they love oh my goodness Gifted Man oh you know anointed of God healings and miracles and signs and wonders and then that discernment no there's it's never been never been one like it and listen it hadn't been in a continuous Ministry since the days of Christ I don't mean that there wasn't a man that every once in a while would get a word of knowledge or something and know something about somebody or you know and and symptoms but over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again that's right continuous Ministry to show us to vindicate us the word was here now so the third pull he said is the third phase or the third part of his ministry would be the opening of the word the opening of those Seven Seals it would be that that would catch the elect the Covenant people in perfect faith brother Branham says this is coming to that third pull I went to all that to explain about the three pulls that's the part that we're in today we are in the third phase of brother bradham's Ministry where the word has been opened to bride people this is this is coming into that third poll I believe in it I want to ask you a sincere question you that passed through the prayer line can you actually believe and feel like that now there's something happening you since hands were laid on you raise your hands that's what we waited for this is just starting to bloom now it's just starting to bloom I did this for a purpose I'm working out something that's taking this charge of faith and going right back to begin and come in and to kind of raise faith in a bracket where you've never noticed it before that way not a faith but a perfect faith notice what the opening of the word is to produce a not just a face but a perfect faith and he said uh built it up in here what's a perfect god with a perfect heart with a keep a perfect promise my perfect word which is sharper than a two-edged sword and a discernment of the thoughts and into his heart we're coming now to Perfection because the people has to come to this in order for Rapture that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured faith and it means a lot of shaking down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God I just say God shake me Shake every bit of unbelief out every bit of Darkness everything that ain't like you shake it out of me Lord amen until that there resides within me a perfect Faith amen because people has to come to this in order for a rapture now this is the purpose I did it he said it's taking this charge of Faith to raise faith in a bracket wherever you never noticed it that way before not a faith but a perfect faith you see the word has come to empower us the word has come to bring us back to Faith again this is what he would come to Sarah where Sarah would be asked is there anything too hard for the Lord and then she would judge him faithful that made the promise you see it came the message of the son of man was coming to turn her heart back to believing again so our commission is to cast out Devils to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you will make serpents powerless the poison that Satan has used against you he will render harmless Hallelujah take that down in your heart to this morning the poison that he is designed against you that he's been waiting to bite you and you have been bitten by it I want you to know the poison that Satan uses against you will be rendered powerless Hallelujah fulfilling the scripture no weapon that has been farmed against you shall prosper no matter what the devil is trying to do for you to you no matter how you were born no matter what your past no matter what your situation the poison that has been against you will be rendered Palace because we are under a Great Commission [Applause] remember I ended on this last Sunday where that when the apostles followed his first commission he said I behold Satan lets lightning fall from Heaven Luke 10 18. put that up there Luke 10 18. I beheld do you know that this is not the only time that a people is going to behold Satan falling from heaven Jesus said when they come back and said the devils are subject to us we cast them out in your name come on this is still under the blood of bulls and goats by the commission gave by Jesus how much more now good blood of Jesus Christ takes away every sin and you stand Justified you never did it in the first place and God's thinking before the world began listen and he said I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven do you know it's prophesied in Revelation 12 that Satan again will stop from heaven in fact of the matter he will be cast out of heaven [Applause] the Bible said we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities hold that scripture up for me right there just keep that against principalities and powers and rulers of darkness in high places King James doesn't always do us a favor it is translated that word Heavenly places every other time so he said we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and rulers of darkness in Heavenly places what does that mean that means that every time you start to take your position as a son or daughter of God Satan is there to oppose you oh brother Tim I got prayed for I ain't gonna get prayed for again I'll tell you that the devil's been biting me well brother we started the battle when we prayed for you as long as you were just happy to live with that devil come on amen it didn't matter but brother the moment that we began praying Satan had to move and roll out of his bed to deal with you come on because you were coming before the throne of grace and you were demanding your rights as the child of God my righteous healing my righteous salvation my rights and salvation for my children by right captain Black Jesus you pay for it so the moment you start moving did you ever did you ever notice them those Prime Ministers of Israel they can get along just fine I mean yeah there'll be a few squirmishes and fusses and this and that and the other but let them head toward Temple mount let one of them dare welcome Temple mount ever Arab will come out of the Woodworks screaming yelling violence rioting tearing down disrupted don't you dare your Jews have no right to this holy place and it is their rights and I want you to know the devil does the same thing to you every time you move toward your position of censorship the Devil comes along to oppose you and say he sinned he did this he did that he did another he made that mistake come on you know that every time the Devil comes to you with one bombarding you here and there you have no right to this healing you have no right to your children don't know you know how many mistakes you made with him you have no rights and he'll howl and he'll scream and he'll yell the moment you start stepping on a promise you start moving up in your position in Christ and taking your place of sonship every devil in hell goes to howling [Applause] trying to Buffalo you and and they're thinking you can't have that [Applause] amen they did this they did that you know they're the accuser of the brethren by the way they're not all lives either they're things you really did and he's coming and accusing you and said you have no right because of what you did but Jesus hallelujah amen he's her attorney that man in his blood and her seeds for us are you with me amen and he is seating of your behalf heaven to save you from the accuser of the brother and said let all their sins be on me let them free that's [Applause] to it [Applause] great this is his first Commission in his last Commission go with me to revelation 12. I can preach I could preach a whole nother sermon on this you go in Revelation 12 there's a woman Israel clothed with the Sun that's the gospel ahead of her she's about to bring forth a Munch Man Child the moon's the law which is a shadow of things that comes under her feet upon her head or 12 Stars which is the 12 Patriarchs she being with child she's expecting Jesus to come she cries prevailing with birth in birth and pain to be delivered verse 3. now there appears another Wonder in heaven and it's behold the great red dragon and he's got seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads and just tell Drew that there are parts of the stars of Heaven he's a Deceiver brother Brandon would always say about this it wasn't his t-a-i-l it was a t-a-l-e that he told the tale he told angels and the tale he told Eve and the tale he tells you and notice what he says his tail drew a third part of the stars of Heaven that cast him to the earth and the dragon stood before them the woman which was ready to be delivered for devour her child as soon he was born and she brought forth a man child that was Jesus Christ who was to rule all nations with the rod of iron this is the millennium and her child was caught up unto God and to his throne so you see God took him from here took him to his throne it was a Rapture that took place and the woman goes into the wilderness where she has a place prepared of God that they should feed her there a thousand and two hundred and three score days if you would look right here in Revelation here from from revelation 5. to Revelations verse 6. 12 and 6. from that period in their to the beginning of the and in there is two thousand years of Gentiles because from the Rapture of Christ to where the woman is seen again is when that she's in a Wilderness when God recognizes Israel as a nation and they feed her there three and a half years so there's three and a half years left to the Jews now follow this along the line and there was war in heaven now Satan turns back to heaven this is our day because I just told you that Jesus said have you ever have you ever noticed when a big thunderstorm comes through and tornadoes and what do you know what it's heavens and they're having a battle there the big cold front will come from this way in the warm front here and they'll meet in a in a common Battleground and there will be lightning and Thunders and ferocious winds and tornadoes and everything else I mean the heavens will be on fire until one of them wins and the Bible tells you and there was war in heaven Michael which is who is like Jehovah he and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angel now there is a war that starts in heaven amen listen we're coming back again I saw I saw lightning Satan ball is lightning from heaven with Devils were cast out now in the end time there was to be a war in the heaven and Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels are you ready for this amen and Prevail not Hallelujah the script is already roped as to who's going to win you are not losers Little Children You are the winners Hallelujah because he prevailed now that's not saith the Lord the devil that's against you will not win Hallelujah I don't care how much noise how much lightning how much disturbance how much he deserves to win how much he create the atmosphere and tornadoes and passes he will not win I don't care how long you've been in a battle I don't care how hard it's rained he will not win he prevails not Hallelujah neither was their place found any more in heaven Hallelujah because he has no right to stay there in your position [Applause] when son to God appeared before about before job before God in the days of job Satan appeared there among them amen come on Church amen when when there's in zechariah's day when when they when the when the when when the Satan there appeared and he and there was an anointed priest that would stand there Satan came among them Hallelujah but I want you to understand if this place Satan gets cast out neither was their place found any more in heaven somebody ought to shout about that because the devil don't belong there yes give it on there he has no right to stand there and say anything against you in the blood of Jesus Christ has canceled ever said and dare you it in you he ever been in the evidence is gone hey hey and prevailed not and neither was her place found anymore in heaven next verse and the Great Dragon was cast out not you because you got a right to be there and that old serpent oh yeah that old servant let's call him what he is the old ancient serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth all the world he was cast out of the earth and his angels were cast out with him now this is when the Dynamics will come satanic Dynamics will come to the mechanics that are already set in place for the mark of the beast but it's not for you to worry about it because as Satan comes down you are going up you are not a part of the Fallen World you are part of the ascending bride did you get that a Rapture is an Ascension hey yeah come on you go back to the days of Enoch did he build a pyramid that pyramid was called the place of Ascension and it didn't build it for a graveyard he built it for a place to ascend that when the Capstone comes or the time of people who would match the coming Christ and would Ascend and it's a place to ascend it from but the Pharaohs and denominational men make it into a graveyard full of dead men's monks but we're coming back to a place where the pyramid has been cleansed from the Creeds of man and it is now again a place of Ascension and we're not down here in the base we're all the way up at the top where the the final Stones match the coming Stone and the same Ministry that that that that that coming Stone had this this bride has the same Ministry and they match together and when she does all the dead in Christ from Seven Ages all down to the pyramid will rise from The Seven Ages and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan was to see that the whole world and he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him verse 10. and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now it comes salvation what you know Salvation was 2 000 years ago when Jesus died but now here comes completed total salvation because this is redemption of our bodies now he's come salvation and strength oh Sarah didn't what do you need sweets at the Kingdom of our God the full power of the Holy Ghost the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night Hallelujah God is shutting the mouth of your accuser [Applause] look at the next verse now and they overcame him now we understand who's been fighting this battle it was not Angels after all Angelic battles became human battles and he said at day overcame him no blood was ever shed for an angel so it was you that it was shed far they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives to to death next verse therefore Rejoice you have us oh my what a day of rejoicing that will be let your musicians come what a day of rejoicing play that song when we all get to heaven will therefore Rejoice you heavens and you that dwell in them that's us this is the raptured Saints oh my goodness you think we get happy here wait till we wear our new clothes [Applause] Hallelujah wait till I get it my new body wait till I get rid of these old rags oh Hallelujah you talk about dancing clothes dancing shoes amen therefore Rejoice you heavens and you that quell in them the world to the inhabitants of the Earth for the
