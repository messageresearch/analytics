[Music] he promised he would never leave us and never forsake us and he's proven that to be the truth here in the darkest age in the darkest time that man has ever known I believe that we can all testify that he stayed right with us every step of the way and let's just talk to him now Heavenly Father Lord with our heads and our hearts bowed before you would just come humbly Lord recognizing In This Moment Lord our great need of you and how much we need you to come and take control of this service or that you would come and speak in this time Lord that you would have your way and just take control of this vessel Lord push aside the struggles let's decide the worries Lord push aside everything that would try to hinder now and allow us just to step into your lord to your anointing and allow you to speak Lord and for each one present here Lord that they themselves would be be able to press through all the hindrances of the weak and the worries and and things and just enter in to hear what you have to say to my father Lord I ask you to take complete control now Lord that you'll bless them the reading of your word and everything from this point forward that you'll just be in complete control in the name of Jesus we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles and you'd like to turn with me to the Book of Joshua the sixth chapter Joshua 6. and we'll read at the 23rd verse 6 in the 23rd verse amen isn't it good to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen it's wonderful to be able to cast all of our cares upon Him amen verse 23 says and the young men that were spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her Brethren and all that she had and they brought out all her Kindred and left them without the camp of Israel and they burned the city with fire and all that was therein only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord and Joshua saved Rahab the Harlot alive and her father's household and all that she had and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day amen you may have your seats this evening amen I'm so thankful tonight for a message that gave us a promise a promise that that that I'm not going to leave you in this world that's about to be destroyed not only did it give us a promise but it gave us instructions to to what to do to to make sure that that we get out of here and and as we're thinking about this just for a moment I do want to say to the young people that were we are praying for you this weekend as as you go to Oklahoma and they're part of that youth camp and and I pray that as you go it'll it'll be more than just a social experience or just some good services but that you will really get a hold of that which you really need that you'll you'll anchor down and and I like how brother Mike sang that song because sometimes as young people we have experiences and then we'll flounder for a while but I just want to remind you he didn't bring you this far to lose you you know and you're not forgotten and you're not Forsaken and and we are praying for you this weekend but it's so important now more than ever that we have that anchor because we live in a world that is absolutely full of Chaos and I want to speak to you tonight for for a thought for a little bit in the midst of chaos you're coming out in the midst of chaos you're coming out and the Lord had dropped this thought in my heart just the other day during service and and it was very specific and the thought just kept coming over and over again you're coming out you're coming out and I began to look at it I just pray that I can relay it to you tonight because we do live in a world full of chaos and I think one of the most frustrating things for people with even a little bit of common sense or a little bit of decency about them is is how so many people act like that what's happening in our world is okay that they they seem to act like that that um things this is normal and this is right when we can clearly see if you have any bit of Sanity about you that what's going on in our world is pure insanity and and brother Branham says so so it throws the whole world into Insanity the whole thing is insane and so it gradually crept in until the people don't know it and when we can look around and see that that's true to where you know the if you try to explain to them that they're insane they would think you were crazy or you'd be labeled some kind of a bigot or some kind of old-fashioned person that just isn't up to the times and we live in a time where roles are being switched where where men are claiming to be women and women are claiming to be men and you know I saw a headline today that doesn't really have a lot to do with this but it just shocked me it said for the first time in history women drink more alcohol than men do and they just it just jumped out at me and it was a shocking thing to read and I I realized that morals in this day are all but gone and yet people want to act like we're The Crazy Ones you know people want to act like that we're crazy or for that matter anyone who claims Christianity the world is labeling them as bigots you know not even message Believers you could be a good Baptist or something like that and to the world you are so old-fashioned and wrong and you're full of hate and and we don't have to look very far to find the insanity our stories are full of insanity our schools are full of insanity the entertainment that's put out there for people to feed upon is full of insanity and the leadership of our government from the very top all the way down is full of absolute Insanity it has infiltrated every aspect of the life of this world and and it was prophesied to be so these aren't things that should shock us or catch us off guard we knew these things were coming it just seems like for a long time we felt like we were in the insanity and you thought well surely it can't get any worse and then you wake up the next day and it got worse prophet of God says now look at the position everybody will admit she's in a Sodom condition I passed over California here the other day and got a hold of a magazine or a paper read where homosexuals had increased 60 percent in the last year see oh my it's pitiful see it's just because women has thrown themselves away that's right and just on the street naked it's just it's just a shame but the Bible said they'd be that way in other words nothing's out of order nothing's out of kilter this is exactly what the Bible said was going to happen he says and even to men it's just they're changed see and it's going to get worse in another if the world would stand another 50 years the whole world would be totally insane so I did a little basic math 1964 plus 50 years 2014. so we are well into Total Insanity we're we're beyond that that that that realm and we've stepped into a realm of Total Insanity and we see the world around us is shaking I feel like even even people in the world you know for the first time are admitting you know something's happening we're at the end time something something's wrong and they're recognizing that because the world around us is shaking and we have major Banks crashing and economic fears are the highest we've seen since 2008. just this week Silicon Valley Bank which catered to many of the world's most powerful Tech investors collapsed on Friday it was taken over by the federal Regulators becoming the largest U.S Bank to fail since the 2008 Global financial crisis then on Sunday Regulators grew concerned over the Financial Health of New York's signature bank now both banks are under the control of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the FDIC we look around and we see the world is on the premises of of World War III which we all know if that was to happen would end and and and atomic destruction just yesterday's headlines as I was looking through these were just yesterday's headlines Russian jet downed U.S drone over Black Sea Russian ambassador to to the U.S says the incident is a provocation belarus's leader leaders Iran visit is an extension of deepending relationships between Moscow and the Tehran the U.S says um Xi Jinping vows to make China's military a great wall of Steel in his first speech of the new presidential term in recent weeks Western allies including Germany the United States and United Kingdom have promised to ship tanks to the Ukraine to help its Forces fight back against a Russian offensive that is expected to begin when weather conditions improve in the spring you can't outrun prophecy these things that have been prophesied down through time are now staring us right in the face and it's no longer something that's out in the future I believe we can look around and we can see the world is in total chaos I look at these events surrounding these different countries through this lens and that is that every one of these kingdoms belong to Satan and so I know that every one of them Must Fall brother Branham says and then he took him upon the Pinnacle of the temple and then he taken him from there upon a mountain and here's what shocks people and he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time just think of that in other words he opened up and he saw all the kingdoms of the world the United States Russia Great Britain all of them he said these are mines Satan did Jesus knowed they was his he says to him and I'll give them to you if you'll fall down and worship me brother Branham says the Bible says that they're controlled by Satan that's the reason we have wars and yet although it may seem as if and and you're going to say oh really I don't tell you all that to paint a picture of Gloom because if you just get hung up right there and you sit right there long enough all those things are very gloomy things they're things that would would cause you to get distracted and worried and because of that but I don't paint that picture for you because that's not to be our picture that's not the picture of the Bride in the last day and although those things are prophesied and they can be used as signs of where we're at that is only drawing from the negative side but the picture that we're to focus on tonight is that in spite of all that in spite of what's happening there is a broad standing on the earth tonight there is a broad standing in power there is a broad restored back and she's getting stronger and stronger each and every day that is our picture she's operating more in his power every day in her very existence is just as much of a sign of the end time as the Sodom condition that has taken over the world you are first time not just a son you are the final sign to the Earth that we are in the end time right now so that's the picture that we look to you know Abraham knew that it was the end time but it wasn't because he was connected to Sodom it wasn't because he was Keeping Up with the current events that's not how Abraham knew it was the end time he knew it was the end time because he was receiving his visitation and getting ready to receive the promised son that's how Abraham knew that it was the end time it wasn't because he was focused on Sodom it's because right in the end time God manifested himself in flesh and appeared to Abraham right before the fire fell God came in flesh would you like to know how we know it's the end time because right before the fire falls once again God is manifesting himself in flesh in your flesh in your flesh in your flesh in your flesh that's the sign I'm looking at the world's always been evil but once again God is manifesting himself in the dust of humanity Hallelujah and even though we recognize and we acknowledge the evil that is in the world and we can see how things that bad have gotten how thing how bad things have gotten we can't allow that to become our Focus because a negative Focus will promote a negative report just pay attention to the things you focus on and how it affects the things you say fellowship with somebody that does nothing but feed on the news and you're going to have a negative conversation but sit down with somebody that's been feeding on the word that's been feeding on the Promises that's been looking to the promise and see how that conversation turns a negative Focus will promote a negative report if your focus is constantly on the negative it's going to come out in your testimony your testimony is an indication of what you focus on the testimony of your marriage if you're always running your spouse down tells me what you focus on the testimony of your church the testimony of your pastor or the testimony of your job or the testimony of your men of the ministry or whatever it may be the testimony about your friends whatever you talk about tells me exactly what you choose to focus on and if we begin to focus on the negative and focus on the negative and focus on the negative our report will be a negative report but I believe tonight that there's plenty of positive to look to in the word he said I won't leave you he said I won't forsake you he said I'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle he said there's going to be a Rapture in the last day we got enough positive things to focus on tonight to look away from the negative so instead of keeping our eyes directed and all the evil tonight I want to I want to bring you past the negatives tonight to the positive I want to go beyond the negatives and tell you tonight that a message has come oh there's a lot in this world that's negative but let's talk about a positive for just a minute a message has come in this day and it has spoke a bride into existence in The Darkest Day in Satan's Eden that there is a predestinated bride that no matter how evil things get how dark things get she will not fall she's predestinated not to fall that's a positive I'm looking at tonight oh but things are bad things are tearing me down you're predestinated not to fall tonight I choose to look at that tonight no matter how evil the world gets no matter how bad things get no matter how many people fall away she will stand true she will gain strength each and every day she will walk further into the word further into the promises cleaning every aspect of her land I say tonight that despite the attacks despite the the affections despite everything that's been said the bride is stronger tonight more mature tonight more raps are ready tonight than she's ever been at any point in the ages I will declare to the enemy Satan you have failed you have not stopped this broad you have not stopped this church but we're growing we're progressing and in the midst of the chaos we're coming out in the midst of your evil we're coming out in the midst of everything you've tried to do you can't keep us here we're coming out evening light Tabernacle you're stronger tonight than you've ever been brother Brown says you're always pointing how Wicked the world's getting but you fail to see how powerful the church is getting at the same time she is rising up standing on the field oh she's a little flock but brother God is with her that's enough right there what else do I need I uh you know yeah sure I love friends I love people around me but at the end of the day if God is with me then who can stand before me he says she's a little flock but brother God is with her and she is going to Triumph just as certain as Christ rose from the dead amen God's Church shall never fail the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it we know that Satan Causes Chaos he Causes Chaos in the world in governments in churches in your personal life in your spirit in your mind these are the storms these are the battles that we're all going to face that we're all going to go through and it seems at times you're going to be completely overwhelmed let's just be honest it seems at times you don't feel like you can take another step it seems sometimes that you just can't make it because it's just so chaotic everything seems so out of kilter everything seems so messed up the prophet of God says how beautiful it is to find that the true and living God still lives today in the midst of all the chaos still God lives and God Reigns that means right now in the midst of your trial God Reigns right now in the midst of your chaos god reigns right now in the midst of your family struggle god reigns right now in the midst of your lost loved one being out there I'd like to declare to you tonight that God still lives and God still Reigns how can I have peace when everything's going wrong how can I have peace when the doctor says they've given up hope how can I have peace when my loved ones farther away than ever before when sickness is around us more than ever before because in the midst of the chaos God still lives and God still Reigns you can have peace tonight God's on the throne God's in your a situation God is in complete control God still Reigns tonight in every situation and I have a word for you tonight you're coming out of it I say tonight in the name of the Lord whatever your battle whatever your struggle whatever your situation he says you're coming out of it you're not coming out of it defeated you're not coming out of it beat down you're not coming out of a dragon but you are coming out Victorious as an overcomer you are coming out The Virtuous sinless spotless bride of Jesus Christ you are coming out of it tonight the oppression is not forever the battle is not forever and God is at one bit worried about whether or not you're going to come through this trial was not placed in front of you to be your end this trial is not placed in front of you to defeat you but you were placed directly in line with this trial that you would overcome it and that you would defeat it listen as we hear the near the end of time and as we get nearer and nearer to the final battles God is going to make sure that his people know how to fight God is going to make sure that his people still know how to swing a sword he is going to make sure that you were battle tested that you know exactly how to put the armor on that you know exactly how to take orders and you know how exactly how to stand and defend your ground and that you know how to take ground when commanded to do so we got battles to face and sure we may not have the same battles that the other Christians had down Through the Ages we may not have to go down into the into death as a martyr we may not have to run and hide into the underground in order to have a church service we may not have the difficulty of not having the word in our own language or the Bible you know people gave their lives that this Bible could be printed in our language we may not have those battles but I want you to know that God isn't afraid to let you be battle tested he isn't afraid of opposition and he isn't afraid of the chaos that Satan has created why because in Exodus 15 3 it tells me the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name Psalms 144 and 1 says blessed be the Lord my strength which teacheth My Hands to War and my fingers to fight how does he teach you how to do these things just by telling you just by talking about it with you no but he put you to the test of and he allows you to go through these things it may not be the same battles that everybody else has but you can't learn how to fight without fighting otherwise you ain't nothing but a Shadow Boxer and that all goes out the window once you get punched in the mouth I'll tell you a story brother Tim might remember this I used to work for brother Tim and I'm going to tell you right now I don't want to fight brother Tim but we're just playing around just Shadow Boxing just playing and in the midst of it somehow I accidentally slapped him right across the mouth that guy right there buddy you ain't never seen Retreat mode happen so quick and all the apologies and I'm sorrys and forgive me Lord have mercy on my Souls because the truth of the matter is you can shadow box all you want but if you don't know how to really fight you don't want to tangle with somebody like that and I'm gonna tell you if you ain't battle tested you don't want to be here when the things that is coming is coming upon this Earth the battles that your fits and have to face and the trials you're going to face I'm not trying to scare you you're going to win but you want to know how you're going to be ready you're going to be battle tested you're going to be victorious in this battle which leads to a victory in this battle which leads to a victory in this battle which leads to a victory in this battle that way when the next battle shows up you don't even Flinch you square your shoulders back you draw your sword and you say let's get this thing done let's deal with this devil right now let's deal with this situation right now let's face it right now no more running no more hiding I'm not gonna hide from this thing I'm gonna overcome this thing but how does he allow these things to happen Judges 3 1. now these are the Nations which the Lord left to prove Israel by them even as many of Israel had not known all the wars of Canaan in other words but God didn't just take everything away and make it a flowery bed of ease for you he said you're going to have to know how to fight too so I'm leaving some things for you to deal with they could have just wiped them all out but then the next Generation would just come up and they'd have been soft and they wouldn't know how to do a thing but he left enemies in the land for the Next Generation to deal with he says in verse 2 only that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them War at the least such as before knew nothing thereof he's going to allow you to have battles he's going to allow you to have trials he's going to allow you to have difficulties but you're coming out of it you're going to overcome you're going to come out of it Victorious how did he teach them by leaving tribes to prove those that had not experienced the battles of the days gone by notice what he said these tribes weren't left to destroy them they were left to prove them they were left to prove who they were this trial isn't left to destroy you but it's here to prove who you are it's here that there will be no doubt that's the Bride of Jesus Christ then not only will God know and you will know but the devil will know that's somebody I don't want to tangle with it has proved exactly who the word says she is she is lined up she is squared her shoulders back she is overcome she is who she says she is it's left there to prove who the bride is it's going to prove each and every doubt or wrong listen there's lots of things manifestation always ends the debate fulfillment always ends the debate oh is she or isn't she oh is there isn't there you know that like I've heard it said before the birth of Jesus proved exactly what Isaiah was talking about that ends the debate and I'm telling you they can say ask whether or not William Branham was a prophet whether he was the seventh angel whether he was Malachi 4 whether or not you're in a cult or not but I'm telling you on Rapture morning it's going to end the debate the Fulfillment of that right there is going to end the question they are who they said they were it's going to end it once and for all it's going to approve exactly Who We Are you know many times we get so bogged down in a trial that we begin to think it's forever we begin to think that this is Who We Are and the devil begins to lie to you and tell you that your situation is permanent that there's no way out that this trial is punishment for your wrongdoings that you're always going to have this sickness that you're always going to have this anxiety I'm telling you that this trial and this Affliction that you're dealing with is temporary it is not forever the devil wants you to Envision a future to where you're still dealing with this struggle well you know am I going to be able to do this down the road because of this arthritis well 10 years from now am I going to be able to am I even going to be able to do this and this because of of this diabetes well what's going to happen because you know this stuff runs in my family and he tries to get you to Envision a future to where this sickness still has a hold in your life a future to where to where when you begin to think of the future and in that future you are still fighting this same fight he's got you exactly where he wants you but when I begin to think of the future I begin to say this dry season in my life is temporary this hardship that I'm going through right now is temporary my future is clear in my future there is complete healing in my future there is a complete deliverance in my future my family is completely restored in the future my prodigal has come home I say the waters are running clear in your future tonight look at the future and speak what you have need of because you're coming out of this situation it is not permanent you are permanent you are forever you are Eternal but this situation is temporary Hallelujah you look at your future and in your future there is victory over what you face tonight pardon me got it it's based on acceptance well I just can't accept it like that I just can't accept I just can't accept it by faith well whether you accept what God's telling you or whether you accept what the devil's telling you it's still based on acceptance you just have to choose which one you're going to accept the symptoms or the promise you got to just make a choice which one am I going to accept the symptoms or the promise brother Brandon would say now they might have said father of Nations we heard you 25 years ago say you was going to have a child by Sarah and out of that was going to come nations of people with just how many children do you have at this time father of Nations huh see that's the same old critical spirit that would criticize what did Abraham said he he staggered not at the promise through unbelief why here you prayed for so and so when they didn't get well that doesn't matter if I pray for ten thousand tonight and ten thousand die in the morning tomorrow night I'll still anoint I'll be anointing the sick and praying for them because God said so doesn't stop it a bit God promised it I believe it certainly he says it doesn't matter if ten thousand died on this side today trusting think about it now doesn't matter if ten thousand die today trusting ten thousand died on that side tomorrow trusting that has nothing to do with me I'm the individual I'm the one that's trusting I'm the one that believes it and we see back Yonder if we wanted to open up our channels then if we can and see we find this one and that one and this one and that one thousands of them he says testify what are they testifying of what are all those down Through the Ages testifying they're testifying you're going to come out of it you're going to make it you're gonna overcome Sarah was Barren for 90 years and she testifies you're coming out of it the woman with the issue of blood had it for 12 years and she testifies tonight you're coming out of it the man by the pool of Bethesda he had a infirmary in his body for 38 years and he testifies tonight you're coming out of it you say I've been dealing with this for a really really really long time Rahab was a harlot for 40 years and she testifies tonight you are coming out of it oh it's been a really long time in my life I've been struggling with this I can't hardly overcome it Lazarus was in the grave for four days and he testifies tonight you're coming out of it you're coming out of this situation you're coming out of the Grave you're coming out of this sickness you're coming out of this oppression of hell it is temporary they testify tonight it's not defeating you it's proving you job 23 10. but he knoweth the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold now the gold part is great and we understand all the significance of that but I just want to focus on those first four words you're going to come forth you're coming out of the trial you're coming out of the Temptation you're not going to be burned up bite destroyed bite stuck in it I shall come forth I love that you're going to come out of that just as gold refined in the fire you shall come forth as gold that is approved and improved one writer says he says you're going to be found to be good and made to be better you're going to come out of this better than when you went into it Hallelujah First Peter 1 and 6 wherein you greatly rejoice this one always kind of stumped me because many times you're like why would I rejoice through manifold Temptations but it says wherein you greatly Rejoice though now for a season notice is temporary if need be you are in heaviness through manifold Temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ now verse 6 started with the word wherein so if we'll go back to verse 6 and we'll see it says wherein and so it tells us that it's referring back to previous verses in other words when it says wherein it's carrying on from the previous verses look at verse 3 and what we find there is abundant mercy and a lively hope go to verse 4 an inheritance incorruptable and undefiled reserved in Heaven For You Verse 5 it says that we are kept by the power of God then it goes to verse 6 and it says all these things because of these things wherein we greatly rejoice in other words it is a season that you're going through a season of Trials but all these things in verse 3 and verse 4 and verse 5 these are Eternal things rejoice in those things you may be going through something tonight but it's just for a season rejoicing your salvation rejoice in your eternal life rejoice in the restoration of your family rejoice in your healing Rejoice that there's a Rapture coming to take us don't focus on the season of trials that you're in that's how we greatly rejoice in our trial in other words look at the great things we have in God instead of the temporary negative situation that's going to end and continue to praise him right on through it knowing that you're going to come out better than you went in praising him for the outcome before you ever see it Hallelujah he says greatly rejoice because these things are eternal but the trials are temporary listen the chaos is only for a season oh my life is so full of chaos out of the chaos you're coming out it's only for a season it doesn't Define you it's not who you are it's not going to take you down brother Brown says the devil can put out scarecrows and everything else and make you shadows and say you're gonna die in the morning and this is the last die-hour and this and that and the other but that don't scare the believer he's just a bluff if God reveals to me it's not going to happen I don't care what he says I'm going to come out of it anyhow but then we get to the hard part we can all amen those things but the hard part is that while we're going through it the Lord wants us to stay patient and positive that's hard to do I'm ready be well tomorrow I'm ready for financial troubles to be finished right now I'm ready for all the prodigals to come home yesterday okay but he says be patient and be positive James 5 and 7 says be patient therefore brethren and why is he wanting us to be patient one thing your patience proves a trust you know when the little kids they're like hey can we go get ice cream and you're like yeah well a couple hours later like can we leave yet can we leave yet can we leave really what it is they don't believe you're really going to take them but the patience proves a trust I know you're going to do this so I'm just going to sit back and be patient it is actually impatience that leads to unbelief because when it doesn't happen when we wanted it to or when we thought it was going to happen or when we expect it we begin to slowly maybe not with our mouth but we slowly give up on it our faith begins to weaken but it's due to impatience if we didn't put no time limit on it then the promise is just as good today as it is 10 years from now the timing of it means absolutely nothing so he's telling you be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman waited for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he received the early and latter Iran what's this mean be patient means bear your afflictions without murmuring help me Lord bear your afflictions without murmuring this one we really love and your injuries without Revenge if someone does you wrong you best not try to avenge it and though God should not in any signal manner appear to you immediately wait for him verse 8 be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh what's he mean establish your hearts let your faith be firm without wavering your practice of what is good constant and continued without tiring and your resolutions for God and Heaven fixed in spite of all sufferings or Temptations Grudge not one against another that is pretty cut and dry Brethren now if you actually get into this what it's dealing with is this he's talking about how so many times Christians have patience and forgiveness for people in the world and yet the minute a brother does them wrong they want to hold it over them and he says don't hold he's literally saying don't hold a grudge against a Christian don't grudge against one another brethren lest ye be condemned behold the judge standeth at the door in other words if your brother's done you wrong first of all don't worry the judge is out the door he'll deal with it but second of all the minute you begin to judge you have taken the condemnation off of him and you're bearing it for him you become the guilty party and the judge is at the door for you verse 10. take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering Affliction and of patience and here's what we're getting to behold we count them happy which endure you have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful meaning he's full of pity and of Tender Mercies what does it mean right there where it says and we have seen the end of the Lord not that the Lord ended surely we know that's not what it's talking about it's talking about it's relating it back to job and it's saying you've seen how job was patient you see how he kept believing you see how he held on and you see how the Lord ended that for him do you see how the Lord dealt with his troubles you see how the Lord dealt with it yes he went through awful times but those times were temporary and on the back side of it job was blessed greater than he ever was on the front side of it so he's saying just be patient look what God did for job he's going to do the same thing for you if you'll just hold on to the promise if you'll stay positive if you'll stay patient on the back side of this thing you're going to be blessed more abundantly than you were before you went into the trial but you got to stay patient what did the Lord do in the end although it was hard although life was chaos in the end he was blessed greater than at the beginning in the end all things were restored relationships were restored his family was restored his wealth was restored and his health was restored but it points to job's patience which proved a trust in God amen so when you're in the midst of this you have to remind yourself this troubled time is not the end of me because in the midst of the trial it's easy to begin to believe in that when all you can see is trouble when all you can see is heartache when all you can see is your depression it's hard to look beyond that with these eyes and go I'm going to be happy I'm going to be blessed but you have to fight through the Gloom you've got to push back the darkness you've got to be willing to stand and swing your sword that's exactly what God's wanting you to do swing your sword tonight cut yourself a path back into the light tonight Joe 42 10 says and the Lord turn the Captivity of job when he prayed for his friends I found this to be very interesting these are the friends who had accused him who had said all kinds of negative things about him these are the friends that had done him wrong and yet job wasn't blessed until he prayed for them my you would think it needed to be you know you know hey y'all got to make everything job had to pray for them and then God turned the Captivity of job when he prayed for his friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before go down to verse 12. so the Lord blessed the latter end of job more than the beginning you're going to come out of this you're going to come out of this his trials one writer would put it like this his trials began in Satan's malice which God restrained but his restoration began in God's mercy which Satan could not oppose I'm telling you when the mercies of God are poured out upon your life Satan can't oppose it he can't stand before you any longer when he begins to to restore when he begins to bring back when he begins to put you back in the position that he had for you all along what I want you to notice is it's not like in the middle of this trial all of a sudden God decided you know what I'm going to bless job in this you know what I'm going to bring this to an end that's going to be good for Joe that's not how it was that's what what God knew at the very beginning before it ever started that was going to be the outcome before you ever went into this trial because I know the thoughts that I have of you thoughts of good and not of evil to bring you to an expected end this was always going to be the end this was always going to be the verdict this is always how this fight was going to turn out this bride was always going to overcome you were always going to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you were always chosen in him before the foundation of the world it's not just right now he's going I'm trying to decide whether or not they're going to pull through he's telling you tonight you're gonna pull through you're gonna make it you're gonna come out of this thing you're gonna be blessed and you're going out and you're coming in you're going to overcome that's been the decision all along that's been how he's felt about it all along he didn't just turn good thoughts towards Jude right there at the uh towards job right there at the end brother Brown says that instead of him getting weaker the Bible said he got stronger all the time got stronger when he was 100 years old he was still giving God praise he was going to have it and he did they had this child because God said so God is to be took at his word What God Says comes to pass no matter how long it is what it is God said so and you just hold on to it that's all just stay with it it will bring you through there's no reason for you to fear the outcome you know the trial you're in you know the biggest thing Weighing on your heart you know the biggest struggle you're fighting you know where the devil is trying to pull you down to here in recent weeks and months there's no reason to fear the outcome there's no the outcome isn't Up For Debate you're going to come out of this you may go in you may be in the middle of it right now but you're going to come out of it better than when you went in you're not going to lose you can't lose brother Brown says hold to God's unchanging hand when everything else is falling it'll stand there and hold if you'll stick to it it'll bring you out just hold on to it and now as we Circle back around to our opening scripture where we were with Rahab that's exactly what Rahab had to do she received a message with a promise Joshua 2 and 14 says and the man answered her our life for yours if you utter not this our business and it shall be when the Lord hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee verse 18. behold when we come into the land Thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy Brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be Guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in thy house his blood shall be upon our head if any hand come upon him what they say to a Rahab it doesn't matter how bad it gets Rahab it doesn't matter what's going on in the streets it doesn't matter what you hear going on right outside your door it doesn't matter that governments are falling it doesn't matter that banks are falling it doesn't matter that sickness is on the other hand it doesn't matter that there's others running away it doesn't matter that the walls you're trapped in are 20 something feet thick Rahab none of that matters no matter what happens you stay underneath that message you stay underneath that token no matter how much chaos begins to come you make sure you stay underneath there and I promise they made a promise by their lives they promised by their life that no harm will come to you but you are going to come out of this oh Church come on this ain't spies we're talking about this ain't even a messenger we're talking about but he promised by his life he promised by his life just stay under the token stay under the blood no matter how bad it gets no matter what the chaos is you're coming out you're coming out of it just stay in the house stay under the blood you're gonna come out of it he promises out of the rubble out of the chaos you're going to come out you're going to make it and not only you but there's more coming too because it wasn't just Rahab there's more healings coming there's more Deliverance coming there's more going to be filled with the Holy Ghost there's more refillings coming there's more families going to be restored there's more prodigals coming I say let it be my kids Let It Be My Home Let It Be My refilling Let It Be My Holy Ghost Let It Be My healing there's more coming just stay with the message don't get caught up in the chaos there's more coming not a hope so but she knew it was a no-sew I'm coming out and my family's coming out of this with me listen rahab's Faith saved her family just like Hattie writes faith and her response saved her boys just like the Roman centurions Faith saved his servant you can have faith for your children you can have faith for your parents you can have faith for that lost loved one and that faith can reach the heart of God and they can be saved they said you get everybody in this house I'm telling you Rahab probably didn't go up to him and say hey y'all come on in I mean if you don't want to that's okay it's no big deal it's just gonna all Crash and Burn but I mean you can come in if you want constant prayer constant believing my daddy's coming in this house my mama's coming in this house my family's coming in this house you got to get in this house there has to be an urgency sometimes we just take this message and it's so nonchalant and it's just so I'm listening I'm telling you the fire is about to fall the fire's about to fall and you're going to come out but there's others that we want to see come out with us and I say urge them to get in the house compel them to get in the house stay on your knees for him pray for him but not only that not and I hope so but in a no-so me and my family shall be saved you have to begin to let Faith arise in your heart instead of doubt you got to look away from the chaos all around us in this world look away from the negative and begin to declare we're coming out we're going to make it instead of feeling sorry for yourself well sometimes sometimes it's one step at a time sometimes it's just a grain of sand moves off that mountain but you got to go about moving that grain of sand you got to go about chipping at the thing you got to go about attacking that thing you gotta you got to take the word and start hitting at it instead of just sitting around going this is it well yeah I believe the Lord's my healer that ain't hitting at the thing Satan knows he's a Healer you take that and you take thus saith the Lord and you start beating that thing to death you go on the attack and you start beating at it and chipping at it and beating at it until you gain a little bit of ground and then don't stop there but you beat at it some more and you fight for it it's not gonna come easy but you got to be willing to go after it the devil says there's no use he makes you afraid to expose him what do people think he makes you afraid to go on the attack makes you afraid to stand up for yourself because that's what bullies do brother Brown said you got to start pecking at it he said you Peck right against the shell just as hard as you can Hallelujah Satan get away I'm coming out of here that's it I'm not laying here anymore I'm not sitting here anymore I'm not on this old Devil's Ground no more I'm pipping my way out this morning amen I'm an eagle amen hallelujah but that little old Eagle that that trip Hammer neck back there pecking against that shell no matter how hard the shell was it pecked right on through it first thing you know he could flop his wings a little if we could get some people just to get get their wings moving we could just get a wing up in the air if we could just get something having what's happening is you're still caged in that that shell you're still stuck there and it's glory to God well look it may not be much but you're going to have to Peck at that thing a little bit and no no don't don't be ashamed of that we all start somewhere all right but eventually you're gonna get that that Wing out and once that wind gets out you can reach over and start trying to free the other arm and pretty soon your legs get free pretty soon your voice gets free and before long you ain't bowed no more but you can shout the glories of God you can run for his glory you can shout You Can Dance why because we're emotional no because we're free because we fought at it and we fought for it and we wouldn't stay bound down we wouldn't lay down on the Devil's Ground we said I'm coming out I'm coming out no matter what I have to do I'm coming out Hallelujah he says he got his wing he could flop it a little he was all right he said pack your way out that's right how do you do it blessed it with thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord finally you begin to smell some fresh air thus saith the Lord get your head on the outside thus saith the Lord push hard now you're coming out Hallelujah the bride ain't gonna stay caged up the bride ain't gonna stay inside some some shell the bride's going to rise above all the chaos you know a lot of that chaos is religious chaos a lot of that chaos is the chaos of religion the chaos of man's ideas and the chaos of of man's dogmas and they begin to wall them in with their idea of the message ain't no different than than denominational walls you're walled off you're walled in I want to tell you the bride's coming out you can build all them walls you want but they're going to fall because the bride's coming out amen Rahab knew that the way the messenger taught her was the only way look we recognize tonight there's no better way than God's provided way why do we preach the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost just like they had on the day of Pentecost because even though they have tried for thousands of years they haven't found a better way they haven't found a better way we if we want to come out of this chaos we got to stick to the instructions just like Rahab was willing to do they've tried to find a better way and it has led to churches being full of every unclean and hateful bird full of unrepented and unchanged people that's just the truth because if you're not born again then you're just unchanged you're an unchanged person brother Brown says neither have they found a better way for a chicken to get out of an eggshell than to Peck his way out he must follow God's provided way in order to live amen that works on human beings too he says that's what's the matter with the Christian church today is try to accept some manufactured way instead of beating its way through to the kingdom of God has tried some other way and it won't work you will kill your patient you will kill your baby God's Baby by trying to manufacture some way oh there's no need of this boohoo and crying there's no need of all this oh yes there is he says now neither have they ever found any better idea for ducks and geese to come south from the north than to swarm and then fly their way down no other way you see before they fly down south or fly from the south back North they swarm first I've seen some swarming in here before he says they swarm first listen to him describe it before they leave their grounds or homes to a new home they swarm bees do the same thing they swarm that's nature what is it they have a Revival they'll all swarm and get together you never heard such a noise in your life and before we can ever leave this habitation to a new one we got to swarm in a Revival hallelujah amen I believe the prophet yes sir he says oh you get around a bunch of ducks and geese you never hurt so much jabber in all your life what are they having a Revival they're fixing to take to the air amen I say there were a bunch of people about to take to the air tonight I said we need a swarm in Revival don't try to tell that duck he don't need to swarm he knows where he's going and he knows God's way is the only way and he ain't afraid of it finally don't tell him I tell you what just sit real quiet and we'll put you all in cages we'll put you on a truck we'll drive you to south Louisiana let you out in the marsh you know where they're taking you dumb old duck they're taking you to the slaughterhouse you better get to swarming and get out of there before they get your cage down and swarm because we're about to take to the skies we're about to take to the air and in the midst of this chaos we're coming out we're leaving here we're going home and we're swarming first getting ready to go Hallelujah Glory you can't convince that duck to sit still if he sit still he's gonna freeze to death he's got to go he's got to move oh yeah they'll say oh just just believe just accept it just sit still right there we'll take you down to the to the marsh and yeah you can't have ducks that don't know how to battle to get through things they got to know what it's like to get up in the heavenlies and fight against the currents and Fight Against the Wind go through every storm and every trial but guess what they're flying still the same they're fighting because if you don't if you just Coop them up and drive them down there you ended up with an offended duck softer than a chicken that ain't gonna be able to live on its own it's got to be hand fed everything I say Lord whatever the storm whatever the battle whatever I gotta go through let me fly let me start moving my wings a little bit let me swarm a little bit whatever I gotta do to take to the heavenlies don't let me be here when the walls fall because I see the chaos I hear the Earth rumbling I see the wall shaking and I don't want to be Earth to Mound when it all comes down let me take to the heavenlies tonight Hallelujah hey man we're going to start bringing this down they'll tell you just believe just love just accept the truth amen you better I agree with all that but you also better come God's provided way of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and get a new birth experience brother Brown says the trouble of it today they put their name on the book and join church and that's all there is to it but God's provided way is to stay there and work your way through until God gives you the new birth that's exactly right pick him out it'll kill him he says that's what's the matter today with people a new birth they all dodge it I want you to listen close this is the prophet they don't like it oh they have substituted something for the New Birth come up and believe and that's all you have to do the devil believes himself and you know he's not born again there is a new birth there is something that goes with it it's kind of unfitting and untasting to the world any birth is a mess I don't care where it's at if it's in the pig pen or a hospital of birth is a mess so is the new birth it'll make you do things you didn't think you would do well I never me neither but get a hold to the new birth it says it'll make you get down at the altar and cry and scream and wash the pain off your face raise your hands praise God speak in tongues and all kinds of things the new birth will do that because it's God's provided way to be born again 1964 just in case Hallelujah Rahab had to do what the messenger said to do well I prefer a blue cord actually and I don't want to hang it in front of my window it doesn't necessarily go with my Decor in here so I'm gonna hang it over by the door listen the way you think it should be does not matter my kids hate it when I say this they'll say but I want to and I'll say I don't really care what you want to do not just sometimes their situations you have to say that and some people are telling God I really don't want to be born that way I really don't want to do that I want to go to church I want to do the right thing but Lord sure he says I really don't care what you want I have a provided way now you can come that way or you can be underneath the rubble that's your options you can do what we said and hang the cord where we said how we said or you'll be underneath the rubble with everybody else but she knew she that she had to do exactly what the the spies had told her to do she did exactly what the instructions said because that is what it was going to take in order for her and her family to be saved and I'm telling you tonight little bride trust what the messenger told you to do trust what he said to do believe what he said do even the things you don't understand well why did he have to it doesn't matter do you want to escape do you want to come out from underneath the rubble do you want your family just trust what the messenger said because there's going to be a lot of Chaos listen Rahab you got to trust what we're telling you no matter what don't come out from underneath this token no matter what don't come outside this door because there's going to be a lot going on the walls of the world are going to be falling all around you but you don't move you stay right where you're at everything's going to be falling apart there's going to be death and dying all around you but don't you come out and look you stay right there with that word you stay with that token Rahab is going to be loud out there everything you've ever known is going to come Crashing Down it's all going to come crashing down but you stay with what the messenger said you stay right there underneath the token because it's all coming down look I hate to be the bearer of bad news but everything we know is going to come Crashing Down but you stay with the message prophet of God says but oh this modern American day that we're living in now I tell you our nation is simply polluted there's not a hope left to this nation as I see only an old-fashioned Revival and according to the scripture it'll never be Nationwide so then we're just left it'll be a Revival among the people the elect of God but it won't be a real sweeping Revival to take the whole nation never was and never will be and this great Kingdom has got to fall like all other kingdoms to give way to the Eternal kingdom of God which should be issued in soon but I'd like to declare tonight that even though the kingdoms of this world are completely Fallen that doesn't bother us and it shouldn't scare us because it isn't God's kingdom that's Fallen all around us it's Satan's kingdom that is crumbling all around us it's his walls that are falling it was Jericho's walls that were falling those were the walls that had kept her prisoner those were the things that had kept her Earthbound those are the things that we're beginning to see fall remember the world is falling apart but it's not our world to begin with remember back at the beginning he said he took him to a high mountain showed him the kingdoms of the world every one of them and said they're all mine I'll do with them what I want you see why we have wars who's the ruler of this world now church is totally collapsing the walls Begin to Fall death everywhere Rahab can hear screaming outside there's people running in the streets there's people banging out the door there's people needing help don't come out of that house right now don't come out from underneath there you know she was a type of the Gentile bride loose from man's ideas loose from man's tradition loose from the walls of Oppression loose from false doctrines and there was a lot of chaos that went with her losing there was a lot of chaos that came with her Freedom there was lots of casualties around her Freedom there was lots of people talking bad about the messengers that had brought her the message of her Freedom a lot of people didn't believe the reports of the supernatural that was going on down in the camp of Israel and many began to take refuge in the walls man-made walls and that's where they took their Refuge but she took her Refuge under the promise token she took Refuge into promise it says if you will stay with this you're
