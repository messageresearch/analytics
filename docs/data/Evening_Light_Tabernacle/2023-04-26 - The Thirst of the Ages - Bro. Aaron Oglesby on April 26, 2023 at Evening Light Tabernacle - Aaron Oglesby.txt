and to have your way in this service Lord I pray you to bless the word as we read it you'll bless all that spoken tonight Lord Lord help me to move myself out of the way now and help the hearer to move themselves out of the way May Words of Life Lord come forth in Jesus name amen amen if you have your Bibles with you and you'd like to turn with me to Psalms 42 and 1. Psalms 42 and 1. we'll read down through verse 7. it says as the heart panteth after the water Brooks so panteth my soul after thee o God my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before him my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy God when I remember these things I pour out my soul in me for I had gone with the multitude I went with them to the house of God with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holy day why art thou cast down O my soul and why art thou disquieted in me hope thou and God for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance oh my God my soul is cast down Within Me therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and of the hermanites and from the hill of Mazar deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy water spouts all thy waves and thy Billows are gone over me I'd also like to read Psalm 63 and 1 it says o God Thou Art my God how many can say that tonight early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee My Flesh longareth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is amen you may have your seats tonight we pray the Lord or add his Blessing to the reading of the word I'd like to speak to you for just a moment tonight on The Thirst of the ages The Thirst of the ages and we know that God made man to fellowship with him we know that he was made to walk with him and to talk with him and and to dwell with him and and there's a place in the heart of man that still Longs for that Fellowship today it Longs for that communion with God and and the reason that is is because man was made to thirst we saw David talking about how much he thirsted and how much he longed for God and and man was made to thirst and and what thirst is is the recognition of a need for water it is the craving that results in the Basic Instinct to drink physically and spiritually man was made that he could not live without water he can't live without water the general consensus is that you can live for about three days without anything to drink and and if you don't drink anything you will become dehydrated and then body functions will start to shut down so so Somewhere In the period of that three days even if you're not dead yet because there's lots of levels of Health between healthy and dead but somewhere between that things are going to begin to shut down and and things are going to not function in the manner that they were intended to operate in so to live and to be healthy you must take in a certain amount of water on a daily basis a certain amount of intake needs to come in of water each and every day or else you begin to face the consequences of dehydration I dare say that with the natural typing the spiritual we got a lot of people walking around spiritually dehydrated today because there is a certain amount of water that you have to intake listen if you can only go three days before you die how is it that we can go from Wednesday all the way to Sunday without drinking how is it we can go from Sunday all the way to Wednesday without drinking I'll say this you might not be dead but you're somewhere in between healthy and dead things are not operating the way they should be operating if you're not taking in the water that your soul needs you to take in to function on a daily basis we have got to be drinking and in taking water from that well I say tonight we got to take another drink we have to take another drink tonight of that living water and then we don't wait till Sunday to take our next drink if you take a drink tonight then take another drink in the morning and then take another drink sometimes around midday and then take another drink sometime tomorrow night and every opportunity that you have through the day you need to be drinking from the Fountain of life we got to be taking it in we got to feed our experience we got to seek for a greater experience we got to get away from the mentality of will I drink on Sundays or I drink on Wednesdays or I drink at the special meetings or I drink at the youth camps or or even worse yet I took a drink 30 years ago from the Fountain of Life so I'm good come on now you can't go that long without taking a drink you're dehydrated tonight and you need a fresh drink of living water in your soul you need to take it in more tonight we all need a fresh drink I need a fresh drink tonight you need a fresh drink tonight we all need more of him and I'm glad that I can announce tonight that there is a fountain open in the House of David you need a drink tonight it's there it's available it's inexhaustible and it's open for you tonight to take the drink that your soul so desperately needs it's flowing just as free as it's ever flowed tonight excuse me Jesus Christ is that inexhaustible fountain and tonight that Fountain is open to all who will receive it it's open to the center tonight it's open to the backslidden tonight it's open to the deacons tonight it's open to the preachers tonight the deaconator the the the Deacon ain't no better than the man on the on the Pew the preacher ain't no better than the man in the Pew it's open to all of us tonight and I for one say Lord I'm taking another drink tonight Lord pour out your living water upon my soul refresh me once again Lord let it Bubble Up on the inside of me I need another drink I can't go through tomorrow without you I can't go through Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday without you lord I need a drink tonight and the fountain is open to you the things that are in that water is open to you church I need more joy tonight I need more peace tonight I need more victory tonight I need healing tonight and it's in the water it's in the fountain and the fountain's open you find yourself in need tonight let me go ahead and tell you what you have need of is in the fountain your healing's in the fountain your salvation's in the fountain your joys in the fountain your family's in the fountain but you've got to get to the Fountain tonight and say Lord I want another drink I want to take another drink you can't be satisfied with what you've drinking so far but you gotta take another drink tonight prophet of God says Christ wants a real church he wants a bride let's cut our way through get out here get these Creeds away that the real drinkers might come back and get a drink of real cool Pentecostal water that once flowed from this great whale he says it's still flowing hallelujah it's still flowing I like that tonight he said get those Creeds away get those man-made ideas away let's get away from all the pretending get away from the Sunday Christianity he said let's let the real drinkers get in there tonight oh how many tonight's a real Drinker says make room for me let me get to the Fountain let me get to my place to where it's more than just a church experience but Lord I want to take another drink tonight Hallelujah he says let the real drinkers have at it what is it you have need of tonight in your life what is it where are you standing at tonight where does this service tonight find you at he says it's still flowing he says the fountain is still flowing how there's something about getting into a flowing stream we don't got many of them around here that's why we have bayous but if you ever get into a flowing stream you know it's fun when it's ankle deep it's fun when it's knee-deep but when it's really a gusher and it's really flowing the deeper it gets the more powerful it is oh come on somebody you ever throw something in a flowing stream and then watch it it's gone in a minute you throw it in a snagnet pool and it sits there and it stays there you throw your sins in a stagnant pool and well there they are throw your sickness in a stagnant pool well there it is though your complex is in a stagnant pool they'll still be there but throw it in that Russian River tonight throw it in that gushing water tonight and before you can blink it's gone it's washed away oh Hallelujah throw your past in the Russian River tonight throw your failures in the Russian River tonight and let the gusher wash them all away take your pastor away take your failures away and be washed clean tonight Hallelujah see the enemy recognizes as he usually does he's good at recognizing but he recognizes the importance of water to the believer he recognizes that you can't live without it and so he does all that he can do to keep you away from it he will Point everything there is to keep you out of the house of God he will point to you everything there is any failure any anything any hypocrite you know I saw a thing that I can't claim credit for it I saw this thing where this guy was talking about not going to church because of all the hypocrites he said man there are sinners there he said there's people there struggling there's people there in all this and this other fella said yeah man he said that's the same reason I don't go to the gym he said there's people that are out of shape there's fat people there the other guy said do you ever stop to think that's why the Gym's there to help those people you ever stop to think of why the church exists we're here to help the ones that's struggling we're here to pick up those that are having a hard time we're here to be to put our harm around the one that's been a hypocrite and say you don't got to be a hypocrite you can be real you can be genuine you can be an overcomer I say lay aside your excuses tonight and get back to the well get back to the water we're here for that to be a place where people can come and drink where people can be restored he does everything he can do to try to keep you away to stop your access to the water he tries to stop the flow he tries to quench your thirst with things of the world I said at the beginning that God made man to thirst it's natural for you to have cravings it's natural for you to have have these desires but those cravings and those desires no speeching speaking spiritually now that thirst on the inside of you was put there so you would recognize your need of water what what are you talking about life giving water those things were put there on the inside of you so that you could recognize that you needed the Water of Life you were to hunger you were made by almighty God to hunger and thirst for righteousness you were made to thirst after more of God and God intended to be the thirst quencher he put the thirst in you so that you would desire more of him so that he could come to you and then quench that thirst that was his intentions he says now but God in his great economy for mankind has made man in the way that he wanted man to be he made man to thirst did you notice David here said my soul thirsteth for thee as in a dry land where there's no water just imagine said my soul is so thirsty God I'm thirsting for you just as if I was in a land where there was no water he must find water or perish oh can we get to that place tonight God I've got to find you or I'm going to perish I've got to have a drink from that well tonight or I'm going to perish he says God made man two thirst for God and the devil now listen close has perverted it and made him thirst for his kingdom for the world do you get it The Thirst in man is Godly for God made the man to thirst for God but Satan recognized long ago that if he gave man other options listen we all know we're supposed to drink water and it's healthy but how many of us reach for it maybe I'm the only one I'm pretty guilty of well I need some water I need a Coke man I'm thirsty let me get a Diet Coke because that makes it better man with options usually doesn't do too good Satan gives man all these other options and man would begin burying the desire that that God had gave him bearing a desire for God by satisfying that thirst with ungodly things now think about it now that thirst in man is for God and it's for the living water but man goes about choosing other things to satisfy that thirst so the devil came in and he perverted The Thirst and he knew if he could mess with the receptors in other words think about what would happen to you if your body never told you you were thirsty if the receptors in your brain got fouled up to where you never knew you were thirsty you never had a desire to drink physically what would happen to you you would die and so he comes in and and he starts to it's the same thing spiritually he calls man to go after things that would quench that longing or that thirsting for just a moment and cause him to lose his recognition or need for the things of God he quit thirsting for the things of God because there were so many options in the world he quit thirsting and logging I mean think about it how many people in the world today are walking around like David saying I'm so thirsty for God I must have God or else I'm going to perish why not because of the options they satisfied with drink or they satisfy it with pills are they satisfied with pleasures and they satisfy it with entertainment all the while what they're doing is they're covering up that Godly thirst they satisfy it with the lust of the flesh think about it they chase after one from one woman to the next or they chase from one man to the next whatever the case may be and in today's world they chase after all kind of things to cover up the desire that was put on the inside of them to thirst after God why does The Sinner sin why must they live the way that they live it's because they're it's because they're thirsty it's because they want something to come on the inside that'll satisfy that thirst that'll give them peace that passes all understanding why do they have to take this pill and that pill I'm not saying they don't have real problems when I'm asking you why don't they turn to The Well of Living Water why from this pill to that pill because they just want peace they just want their anxiety to go away they just want their depression to go away they're looking for a piece that'll never be found only in Jesus Christ that's where the peace is that's where Victory is that's where overcoming is but we got to get them to the well we got to get them to the water so we've got to live a life that makes them thirsty thirsty for God thirsty for for True Living Water it's because they're thirsty and so they're trying to satisfy that thirst trying to quench that longing that's deep down on the inside but you're never going to be able to quench a Godly thirst with stagnated Waters of the devil listen you don't need another cigarette tonight that's not going to bring you peace you don't need another drink tonight you don't need another pill you don't need another party you don't have to go back to that pornography addiction those things aren't bringing you peace I'm telling you tonight there is a fountain open in the House of David to all who will receive he says come and drink of the Waters of Life freely whoever is thirsty tonight come and drink that's where you're going to find real peace there are rivers of Life flowing tonight right here in this building how can you say that because The Thirst quencher himself is here in this building tonight and he says to all that are thirsty come listen you who may be struggling looking here and looking there and wondering where am I going to find peace where am I going to find my joy he is the only one that can quench your thirst he is the one that your heart truly desires he is the one that your soul is longing for listen I thank God for the desire for for that hunger on that on the inside of a man's heart that makes him to thirst and I thank God that he took mine that was heading in the wrong direction and he turned that thirst and he turned that hunger and he toured it towards the things of God oh listen let me tell you from experience there's no high that'll match this High there's no party that'll match what happens in this place there is nothing that the world can offer you that can match the pleasures of being in the presence of almighty God that matches the peace and the joy oh Hallelujah of having a true relationship with the Lord God Almighty there is nothing out there that matches it and you'll never find peace as long as that's where you're looking for your peace there is no joy like this Joy you can try everything you want you can try it all and you're still going to find yourself unsatisfied until you drink this water the Waters of the world are going to leave you broken the Waters of the world will leave you hurting the Waters of the world will leave you desperate oh but this water oh this water is full of life this water is full of joy it's springing up in an everlasting life it's bubbling up it's not just stale it's not just some some rules and regulations it's fresh water for the soul tonight I say like brother Branham said may your heart become so thirsty that you must find Christ or die church tonight we can't become satisfied with anything less or anything short than his life living in US we can't stop anywhere short of that we we can't be satisfied where you are if you're Justified I thank God for it and brother Tim even talked about it Sunday we celebrate that we rejoice in that but rejoice in that knowing that there's more for you and if you've made it to sanctification we rejoice in that and we celebrate that but celebrate that knowing that you must keep going to a baptism of the Holy Ghost you must progress and take another step don't be satisfied at just being forgiven don't be satisfied at just being uh Sanctified but get filled tonight with living water get a drink like you've never drank before and let it fill out don't just be a believer you say brother Aaron I'm a Believer congratulations you've made it as far as the devil if that is what you have to stand on then you and Satan are standing in the same place you say that's pretty hard well according to the word James 2 19 says Thou believest that there is one God thou do as well the Devils also believe and tremble that's how far you've made it that's how far you've come I would recommend that we don't stop there I would recommend that we believe and go further and when we take that Milestone we go further and we take that Milestone we go further Enoch walked with God there is no place in this journey in this battle in this struggle to stop and relax you must be progressing from this well I need to get to that well I need more water I need more strength I need more life I need more peace I need more joy how do I get it drink tonight drink from the world get to the well that's gushing forth with life-giving water Hallelujah don't stay on the same plane as the devil is but let me bring the good news you have something that the devil don't have you've got something that he don't got and that is a thirst on the inside of you to be filled with the Lord Jesus to be filled with the spirit the devil don't have that you also have more than a thirst you have the ability to be filled with the baptism of Hallelujah of the Holy Ghost the Devil comes and he says well this well this well this and I say I've got something you don't have I've got the ability to be saved I've got the ability to be raptured Hallelujah you don't don't let that be quenched don't let that thirst be quenched with church Hannity don't let him cheapen that because you sit on a pew go further than that go beyond that don't let that thirst be quenched the thing that separates you from the Devil don't let it be quenched by joining a church and having religion all that does is cheapen The Thirst too many of us don't have that peace and that joy and that freedom because that River ain't on the inside come on now we've quenched it we've quenched the desire and the thirst for a living God to be dwelling down on the inside of us by simply being a church member by simply to say oh we believe the message listen I don't care where you go to church I don't care if it's First Baptist menden or evening like Tabernacle you better go beyond a church experience you better take it to the upper room because going to church here ain't going to save you going to church anywhere ain't going to save you you got to drink from The Well of Living Waters that's the only thing that's going to save you it's got to be more than a church relationship brother Brown says the devil has another way that he makes you to quench that thirst because after all it's a religious thirst it's a thirst after God then the devil tells you just go join the church that's all you have to do now listen to this listen this because this struck me he says that's almost as much hypocrisy or worse than going into the bar room to quench that thirst going to church to quench that thirst is just as much hypocrisy as going to the bar room to quench that thirst he says he finishes the quote and says except a man be born again church we must be born again we must be born again you want to go in the Rapture you must be born again you must have that token listen I'm gonna tell you something he don't care how much you shouted he don't care how much you danced in the spirit he don't care how much you've run around this church he don't care how many times you spoke in tongues he don't care about that if there's no life on the inside of you bubbling out forth manifesting that Jesus Christ is on the inside you're no better off than the denominations if that life's not on the inside of you you're not going in a rapture I'm thankful when the spirit Falls I'm thankful when you run I'm thankful when you shout I'm thankful when the gifts are manifested I'm so thankful for those things but at the end of the day is that life on the inside of you is it bubbling up is it living is it overflowing is it there I'm not sure if it's there it's probably not when you put something on the inside of you that's bubbling up and bubbling up and bubbling up you know it's there you know it's there he wants to keep you away from the water he'll let you jump he'll let you come to church he'll let you run around he'll let you shout or he'll let you sit there and not do any of those things let's not act like that's any better he'll let you sit there like a bump on a pickle and go straight to hell it's about that life it's about that life he wants to keep you from your own Upper Room listen that's what separated Judas when you get right down to it Judas performed all the Miracles too Judas had such a Ministry that when it when Jesus said that somebody was going to betray him none of them said it's Judas now as a matter of fact they were all willing to point their finger at themselves before they would accuse Judas well if somebody's going to betray him it's probably me no no it's gonna be me hey this is a contest the one guy why why didn't they accuse him the Miracles were there there was a Ministry there but he couldn't go to that Upper Room he couldn't go receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother Branham said that's where he showed his true colors it's about that life what are you saying I'm saying don't stop short of that tonight don't stop short get to the Fountain get to the well and once you've had that experience of the new birth and you drink from that Fountain and then deity comes and dwells on the inside of you and now the thirst quencher abides with you and goes with you and The Thirst quencher overcomes through you listen to this this scripture John 7 37 so many times we don't go far enough and we think that River of Life Is there just by believing no it only comes with the new birth this it says in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink that's the invitation tonight if there's a theme for tonight's service that's it right there if you're thirsty tonight Jesus says come and drink next verse he that believeth on me as the scripture has saith out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water Well brother Aaron it says right there all you got to do is believe on him there's nothing mentioned about the upper room there's nothing mentioned about the baptism of the Holy Ghost it just says believe on him and you shall have Rivers of Life flowing out of your belly that's why we read the next verse but this he spake of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified it's right there you want Rivers of Life coming out of your life you've got to receive the spirit you've got to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've got to go to the upper room for yourself you got to be filled and then once you're so filled that it can't contain any more then Rivers of Life Will gush forth out of your life but there must be an upper room experience if you'll lay aside your other thirst quenchers tonight oh come on oh we all got them we all got those things we do that takes up time and does this to satisfy this and does this when we could be given more time to The Thirst quencher if we'll lay aside those things tonight lay aside our self-righteousness lay aside everything that has hindered us from having a full real true experience kept us from having a new birth if we're willing to lay those things aside the night and begin to drink from the rock oh come on he is that rock in a weary land if we'll begin to drink from That Rock tonight there will be an Artesian well that begins to flow on the inside of you it bubbles up it gushes forth it turns over you can't hardly stand still you can't hardly sit there you got to tell somebody you got a witness to somebody your Life's Been Changed you're a new creation you're a new person Hallelujah when you get it on the inside of you but you can't stop short you can't stop short at that point oh there's life in it it's not some old dead Creed it's not some dried up Church Hannity it's not a list of do's and don'ts listen list of do's and don'ts and and legalism and things like that has never produced overcoming lives It produced cycles of failure and ups and downs and people getting disillusioned and people falling away that's all it ever produces but if you want to get people living Victorious you want to get people that came back and overcome that can stand in this evil age that'll be there when the church doors open that'll show the fruits of the spirit that'll show brotherly kindness that'll love one another that'll be real true Christians quit trying to get them to church and get them to the upper room quit trying to get them to church and get them to Jesus Christ oh I understand I know we want them to come to church absolutely come I want you here but just getting you here won't save you you got a drink tonight and you have an opportunity tonight to drink because it's Living Water it's still flowing living Souls can never take their rest anywhere short of a living God they can never settle down for anything less than that one way you can tell if somebody has ever experienced it how do you know brother Aaron well there's no way for me to really know what what you have or don't have that's up for you to know but one way you get a pretty good idea is once they've experienced it they can never get enough of it once they've had a drink they want another drink once they get a little bit of that life flowing on the inside of them listen the the devil's addictions are just perversions you were meant to be addicted you were meant to be addicted to life you were meant to be addicted to where I gotta have more of Jesus I can't go today I need some more give me some more I want some more oh what an incredible setup that is girl you can't get enough of him and he never leaves your side it's the perfect setup I need some Jesus there he is I need some Jesus here he is I need another touch tonight he's here tonight the more you need him the more he's there and he never fails you he's here tonight to give you another drink if you desire that drink that doesn't mean we're going to preach long it just means I was getting pretty warm once you get the Holy Ghost at Life Giving water on the inside the more you want it all the time and he's right there all the time to give it to you listen some of you need to take another drink tonight I'll throw myself in there I need to take another drink but some of you really need to take another drink tonight some of you have been sober way too long some of it's been too long since you took a drink and you're a little bit sober and you say well I'm feeling a little bit dried out I don't know what all the excitement's about we'll get you a few drinks in you and you'll figure it out real quick you'll figure out what makes us so happy you'll figure out what makes us so exciting you'll figure out how you well I don't know if I'm gonna figure it out I'm not sure about all that jump in and shouting listen I done told you that ain't where it's all at but get a few drinks in you of the Living Water and you won't sit still you'll know what's going on because you're done join them you'll get a little bit of life on the inside of it get you moving get them oh oh come on y'all think about that one that got thrown on the on the bones of Elijah that time he'd been dead for a minute that's that's right there's some here there's a few dead ones but if we could ever get you to come in contact with that line it didn't even get down on the inside of him it just came in contact with it and then all of a sudden all the other Fanatics was running having a good time and he went Blowing by them whoa can you imagine what got into him oh some life got into him he was dead for years he sat there for years but one day he came in contact with some Living Water he couldn't stay in the Tomb no more he couldn't stay dead no more he was alive that's what it'll do to you tonight it'll bring life and when there's life there's fight and when there's fight there's overcoming and there's no quit on the inside of you so you got to get that water down on the inside brother Brown says I tell you what's the matter with the Christian tonight you're not drawing dividends on your baptism of the Holy Ghost he says draw in and drink and drink and drink and drink till you push out salvation push out Divine Healing push out the baptism of the Holy Ghost just drink and drink and drink you're planted by the inexhaustible Fountain of Life which is Jesus Christ he's that there he's that thirsty let him drink him that heareth say come whosoever will let him come and drink from The Fountains of the Water of Life freely oh my oh my it's 8 15. we'll have to speed up so y'all bear with me or y'all buckle up and ride with me here we go so Satan understands the importance of water how much you need and he knows that there's no life without it he knows you can't bear fruits without it and so there's a constant battle for it even though the water's there and the supply is constant and the supply is ever present he will try to get you to look elsewhere the water's right there but he'll try to get you to look elsewhere he'll point to your hardships he'll point to your valleys and your hurts as a reason that you should move on try something else he's going to he'll bring a trial in your life and say see this land is no good this isn't for you you're being tried here but God has returned us to the land of the word and I'm telling you there's plenty of water here no matter how bad the trials get no matter how bad the Temptations Get You just stay put don't move out of this place that he's put you in notice here as he speaks to Isaac in Genesis 26 and 1. he says and there was a famine in the land beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham and Isaac went unto abimelech King of the Philistines unto gurora and the Lord appeared unto him and said go not down into Egypt dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of sojourn in this land and I will be with thee and will bless thee For unto thee and unto thy seed I will give all these countries and I will perform the oath which I swear unto Abraham thy father and the enemy's going to come in he's going to do all he can do to get you to move out of the land even though the Lord said stay here don't go down to Egypt but too many times we get to looking around looking for our blessing when's it coming it's coming all of a sudden it's coming suddenly we've been hearing that it'll happen in just a moment you just stay put where God told you to be he said stay in this land and don't move you go where God said go when it doesn't make sense go and When God says stay you better not go if he says stay you better stay no matter how hard the things are how bad the famine is you stay where God said and you watch the blessings flow you watch his hand in your life look at verse 12. then Isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year a hundredfold and the Lord blessed him and the man whacks great and went forward and grew until he became very great for he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and great store of servants and the Philistines envied him for all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father the Philistines had stopped them and filled them with Earth now notice they recognize the importance of water if he don't have water he can't stay in this land sometimes that water gets to flowing too good things get to going too good in your life blessings begin to pile up some people are going man I wish I had that problem but blessings begin to pile up you're healthy marriage is good spiritually you're doing good and the enemy is going to come along and go no it's time to stop up some whales it's time to strive with them for the water and he comes and he tries to bring distractions and obstacles and trials and hurts and offenses to try to keep you from drinking why he knows that the well is where your Victory is he know that the well is where your blessing is it's where life is and he recognizes it's a daily bubbling up in a drinking of this life-giving water that you have to partake in so if you're not listening you may be a wonderful Christian on your way to heaven but if he can keep you from drinking the way you're supposed to he can keep you from fully manifesting all that you're supposed to manifest keep you from reaching the full potentials that Jesus expected you to reach he may not bring you to a lost condition but he can keep you struggling through things that you might not would have had to struggle through if you'd have just stayed in the water just kept drinking from the water so he tries to make you dried up in a lifeless Christian brother Brown says all the things in Arizona are trees is full of stickers everything has a sticker it's because it's dry now if that same Bush growed over here it'd be a nice lovely leaf see it's without water that's the reason it becomes a sticker he says and when the church becomes without the water of life it gets dry and sticky two sticking and punching at everything but where the Water of Life flows it opens up the leaf and makes it tender mellow sweet and holy and acceptable unto God so may the Lord God water us tonight that we won't be stickers but we'll be fine leaves at the Wayward people might sit down under the tree under the shade of our tree and find rest for their souls look I don't want to become a sticker I don't want the people of evening like Tabernacle to become stickers we're always poking and we're prodding and we're cranky and where I got a crowded Spirit about us we want to be full of life to our people can come here and feel welcome where they can come and relax where they can come and rest under the shade of our trees because there's life on the inside of us watch Genesis 26 18 moving quickly Isaac had to have that water so Isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them and Isaac's servants digged in the valley and found there a well of springing water come on somebody they digged in the valley brother Aaron you don't understand I'm in the valley right now I'm in the midst of a hardship I'm in the midst of a great trial I don't know how I'm going to come out of this there's water in your Valley they found water in the valley if you'll just start digging where you're at today don't waste the waiting don't waste the waiting but while you're waiting on the Lord begin to dig begin to dig and suddenly all of a sudden you're going to strike water there'll be life-giving water there oh it's a trial but I've got water it's a valley but I've got water it's a hardship but I've got water there's water in the valley tonight dig Isaiah 41 18. some of you may be in the hardest times of your life listen to this and I will open rivers in the high places and fountains in the midst of The Valleys I will make the Wilderness a pool of water in the dry land Springs of water Isaiah 43 19 behold I will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall you not know it I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert he's going to supply the water sometimes you may have to dig for it sometimes you may have to fight for it sometimes they may strive with you over the well but he's going to supply the water amen Genesis 26 and 20. and the Herdman of Gerard did strive with Isaac's Herdman saying the water is ours and he called the name of the place esec because they strove with him and they digged another well and strove for that also and he called the name of it sitna what does strove mean it means to struggle or fight vigorously sometimes you're gonna have to fight for it but I thought it's open and it's free oh it is but the Devil comes and he knocks life off course Devil comes and he stirs up the home Devil comes and makes it hard for you to focus in the church service it's a daily fight fight to stay in the right frame of mind fight to create the right atmosphere fight to give everything you have when you come to church he fights to keep you cold and formal and you gotta fight to break through into the spirit he's constantly striving with you for the water it's my water oh I know but I'm gonna make you earn it I'm gonna make you fight for the Lord says here you go and the devil says no that's my water no sir we have a right to it but you got to be willing to stand and fight he fights to keep you backslid he fights to keep you in a position sitting there when the Lord's calling out to you tonight saying come to the water come to the water and he's telling you now you're okay you're okay you got to fight through that tonight you gotta push past that tonight because he's fighting to keep you from the water and he strives with you we're going to start trying to bring this down your life may have gone down past that you never thought it would you may be facing things that you never thought you would face and tonight the enemy may have got you in a place where you think can I ever taste that water David was in that place one time will I ever get the opportunity to taste of that water again can I ever get to Jesus again I've had opportunities in the past I've had opportunities and maybe I passed them by but I need him tonight will I ever have that opportunity to get to Jesus will I ever get a refreshing I feel like he's so far away just bear with me remember on the Wilderness Journey there was a rock that followed them The Rock followed them and Moses smoked the Rock and the waters gushed forth out of it Living Waters how much brother Aaron enough that two million people could drink out of it and all their ox and all their animals and everything they had this was a gusher that's what wash your sins away and this rock followed them with life-giving Waters and it was a type of the rock Christ Jesus being smitten at Calvary in the release of life-giving waters that would come forth out of him so in your situation and in your hardship and in your trial tonight and in your despair no matter how far you think you are away from the waters right now remember the rock followed them her brother Aaron I've been backslid for 25 years I don't know if I could ever get back to where I left him you don't got to he's been following you oh I don't know where I'm at I can't find my way back The Rock's right there tonight it's right there when Living Waters and it's been following you through the Wilderness following you through your life following you through your ups and downs following you through your mistakes following you through your failures oh it's been so long he's still right there tonight the rock is right there with life-giving water and he says come and drink come and drink tonight First Corinthians 10 tells us that they drank from the rock that followed them and that that rock was Christ brother Brown says everything they had need of was in The Rock The Rock followed the church and The Rock was Christ Jesus when they were thirsty they drank from The Rock when they were hungry they ate from The Rock wherever they went the rock followed them and the rock is still following the church tonight oh the rock followed them in the water flowed when they had need of water the water flowed I'm telling you tonight just go to the Rock just go to the Rock it's not far away it's right there by you he's right there with you he's never left you just go to the Rock tonight it's not a million miles away it's not 20 years ago it's not 10 years ago it's not a few months ago when you stumbled or last month or last week The Rock Christ Jesus is here tonight and Living Waters are flowing forth and he's saying whoever wants to drink come and drink what are you saying I'm saying get to the Rock get to the water tonight get to the well tonight there's healing in the water oh yeah there's healing there's physical healing there's spiritual healing there's healing for your broken life there's healing for your hurt Spirit there's healing for where people have offended you there's healing if you'll just get back to the Rock tonight there's salvation in the water there's life in the water you say well I was I was saved years ago I got filled with the Holy Ghost years ago there's a refilling of the Holy Ghost in This water the prophet tells us that the that the Dynamics of this bride will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost right as the Capstone comes down to meet her that means we got to have it have you been filled hallelujah it's time to get refilled get to the well tonight Church he's coming soon he's coming soon it's happening just look around and you can see it's happening and I'm asking you are you ready to meet him tonight do you hear the call in your heart tonight saying get to the well get to the well Rebecca get to the well Rebecca what was it it was the evening time brother Brown said the angel of the Lord got to Rebecca before Elisa got there and told her said go get the water oh he's here tonight and he's saying get to the well even like Tabernacle it's evening time the evening lights are shining and he's coming and he's telling you to get to the well get to the well tonight because there's life in the well there's life in the water there's a refilling in the water there's Deliverance in the water there's salvation for The Sinner tonight in the water but you got to be willing to get up and you gotta move and get to the well that same Angel's drawing you tonight oh don't worry I know it's late in the evening I know he's coming soon and your son's out there and your daughter's out there but before he gets here the Angels get into him saying get to the well get to the well go get the water he's come and get to the well half my heart's cry tonight there's water for you but you got to get to the well foreign that's in you it's for more of God that thirst that you've tried to cover up with other things of this world is for more of God and if there's a thirst for more of God in you then it proves that there's more of God for you the Deep calls to the Deep there must be a deep to respond that's not you wanting God that's God calling you that's God calling you I pray though each one of us tonight will be like David my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God listen don't be ashamed to come to the well I'll even say the altar don't be ashamed to come to the altar I think that's so silly that we get this idea in our head that the altar is is only a place where Sinners go the altar is a place of worship should feel free to come to the altar anytime if that's what you need to do to get a refilling or to talk it over with the Lord don't be a a shame to come well what do they thinking brother Aaron I've got saved 20 years ago and here I am at the altar I drank water yesterday and I'm gonna drink more today does that make me crazy does that make me backslidden no I want more of what I got last time I was there last time I was up there it's real good he poured it out on me I want some more of that I want another drink of that pour it out on me again Lord I want more I'm here again saying Lord I'm thirsty my soul alone for you my heart longed for you I want a drink of Living Water tonight pour it out in my soul lord brother and this ain't what I was expecting tonight me neither but sometimes it's at the most unexpected times that we meet Jesus you know the woman at the well had tried everything to quench that thirst we all know her story why did she live the way she lived she was thirsty she was so thirsty we can read her story and tell her heart was good she wanted to be right she was probably even maybe raised in church she knew a little bit about the teachings and where they were going to worship and she knew these things she wanted to be right she was thirsty she'd been married five times the man she was living with wasn't her husband but on this day She was drawn to the well for an unexpected encounter it wasn't her intentions to meet Jesus that day had the Devils that had been trying to destroy her her whole life had any idea who was sitting on that whale waiting on them I promise you they went to a different will they would have tried everything within them to stop me or maybe they did maybe it was the worst month of her life maybe it was the worst week of her life maybe I'm talking to you maybe it's been the worst week maybe your life's been turned upside down maybe you don't know where to turn maybe you're perplexed there's somebody waiting on you at the well just get to the well just push through and give him an opportunity to change everything in your life push through that that's trying to hinder you maybe they're trying the demons they're trying to hinder you the Devils of fear of Doubt of unbelief maybe the torment of your past is trying to keep you from getting to the well tonight I'll say Lord I just want another drink I'm not ashamed to go to the well I'm not ashamed to see for people to see me go to the well I just want another drink tonight but she managed to get to the well and even though it wasn't expected she heard these words John 4 14. but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life oh that must have been wonderful it was but that's not what makes the story wonderful what makes it wonderful is her reply in the next verse she could have said oh whatever it's just a Wednesday night oh whatever I don't even know what you're talking about but she says sir give me this water I'm so thirsty she recognized that it was a thirst she recognized she had need of it she said sir give me this water oh that's my heart's cry tonight Lord I've had it before but give me a drink tonight Lord give me this water tonight Lord let it spring up on the inside of me tonight and she took the greatest drink of water that one could ever drink and he's offering it to you tonight and he's saying take this drink if you drink this there'll be whales of whites bringing up in you this will be your peace this will be your joy this will be where you overcome no matter how hard he's fighting you no matter what valley you're in no matter how hopeless things look the rock is there tonight there's one waiting for you on the well are you willing to go to the well you bow your heads with me take a drink won't you take a drink tonight I want you just be honest with yourself and say I know I've been chasing after things that'll never quench this holy thirst but pour it out tonight Lord pour it out on my soul tonight Lord and pour it out on the tire tonight Lord pour it out on the weary tonight Lord they need another drink we all need another drink oh yes this will change your life in a second sinner but I ain't no different from you I need a drink tonight I need another drink tonight Lord strengthen me Lord pour it out Lord like never before

Jesus is the sole satisfier God Of Heaven has raised up his son and sent forth the Holy Spirit as a gift to the church in this age that Holy Spirit will take and quench every thirst you have and give you blessed peace he says in revelation 22 17 the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take of the Water of Life freely are you thirsty tonight [Music] it's been fought for it was God for and it's been made available to you and I want to ask you while you're drinking it are you drinking it right now in his

throwing my sins in that gushing River Lord I'm throwing every accusation of the devil in that gushing River every complex every fear Every Lie tonight I throw it in that River and I'm gonna be washed clean I'm gonna be washed pure and I say Lord just pour it out on me Lord I'm walking into the river tonight I'm not staying on the banks I don't just want to be splashed by it Lord but Lord I want to be covered in it I want to be bathed in it Lord pour it out open it up and let me drink tonight Lord Lord I love so much that you give the desire to thirst and then that you give the quenching of letters Lord what a provider you are what a God you are What A Savior you are [Music] Lord in this moment as hearts are tendered in your presence Lord you see and you know you know everyone Lord I pray you'll draw I pray you'll pull I pray you'll speak and Lord right now may the spirits of condemnation that would tell people they'd gone too far and they'd done too much we rebuke that in the name of Jesus there's no Spirit of condemnation here but we're here to be washed we're here to be free oh Lord there's no sin too great there's one waiting on them at the well there's one waiting on them at the well Lord just help them get to the well tonight and Lord may they drink may they drink it in Lord may they let it change them forever Lord may it lift them up out of their their battles and their trials Lord here in the valley let me drink Lord here on the Mountaintop let me drink Lord wherever you find me Lord let me drink because you have supplied the water you went to Calvary and you took death so that the rivers of life could come flowing forth out of you how dare us not drink how dare us not take another drink tonight when you so freely provided but tonight Lord we say thank you Lord and we drink and we drink and we drink and we drink and we drink Lord until we begin to overflow Lord May Our Lives overflow so much that those around us can have a drink or maybe they can't break free but maybe they can drink from my overflow maybe they can drink from my saucer Lord and get a taste for themselves until they realize that's the water I want that's the life I want that's the peace I want that's the victory I want that's the Holy Ghost I want oh thank you wait thank you [Music] Lord for each heart here at the altar may you pour it out fresh and new Lord may you fill
