[35:21] the LORD thy God blessed shalt thou be

[35:48] thou goest out and the Lord shall calls
[35:50] on enemies to rise up against thee and
[35:53] to be smitten before thy face they shall
[35:56] come out against the one way and flee
[35:59] before these seven ways and the Lord
[36:02] shall command the blessing upon thee and
[36:04] thy storehouses and in all that thou
[36:07] settest on Hanan - and he shall bless
[36:10] thee in the land which the LORD thy God
[36:12] giveth thee and the Lord shall establish
[36:14] thee holy people unto himself as he has
[36:18] sworn unto thee if thou shalt keep the

[37:17] which I command thee this day to observe
[37:20] and to do them amen god bless you this
[37:23] evening
[37:25] I this subject is so vast it's you
[37:29] couldn't take one service and preach all
[37:33] of the scriptures that contain it and no
[37:36] doubt would take the rest of our lives
[37:37] and I don't know maybe we'll go a few
[37:39] services on it not sure but like to
[37:42] speak to your own blessed own bless you
[37:46] know if we kept reading the scripture
[37:48] here you could actually go home and read
[37:50] this later tonight and you'd find out
[37:53] that the same blessings would come by
[37:55] listening or heeding to the word curses
[37:58] would follow if they didn't follow his
[38:00] word and His commandments and you know
[38:03] after reading all of the blessings you
[38:06] would wonder why they wouldn't heed to
[38:07] the word of God but tonight you know I'm
[38:10] not going to read the curses because I'm
[38:12] not speaking to a curse people
[38:14] hey man I'm speaking to a people who
[38:17] have listened or heated God's Word I
[38:19] believe I'm speaking to those who do
[38:21] what His Word says and as you do you
[38:25] will be overtaken by his blessings that
[38:28] just struck me very deeply to be
[38:31] overtaken as to as one would be you know
[38:34] be chased after or to be to run after
[38:38] these blessings or the God's blessing is
[38:40] to overtake you you know you know and as
[38:43] we know it dealt with Israel you know on
[38:46] a natural or physical basis it was a
[38:48] physical land his brother Tim spoke
[38:50] about even Sunday also had a physical
[38:53] enemy in it and and but with us you know
[38:56] it's a spiritual land it's a spiritual
[38:58] enemy it's not flesh and blood that we
[39:00] face but it's principalities and powers
[39:02] but and you know and and he blesses us
[39:06] not so much in a physical manner
[39:08] although there are blessings that he
[39:10] bestows on us as a and that our physical
[39:13] and and and blessings but I believe that
[39:16] the blessings that we are to desire is
[39:18] not just a physical blessing but also
[39:21] our spiritual blessings amen physical
[39:24] blessings are temporary amen you know
[39:26] you can get a new job you know people
[39:28] post things you know we live in a day of
[39:30] posts you know it's not a fence post but
[39:32] it's a Facebook post or Instagram post
[39:35] or Twitter or whatever you know when
[39:36] they do these hashtags
[39:38] know much about them but you know got a
[39:40] new job and they use the hashtag blessed
[39:42] or got a pay raise bless got a new job
[39:45] or a new house or new car bless but you
[39:48] know Butler Brandon was saying spiritual
[39:50] amnesia said not always prosperity is a
[39:53] sign of a spiritual blessing but
[39:56] sometimes it's contrary said people
[39:58] think maybe you have a lot of old a lot
[40:01] of worldly goods and that shows that God
[40:04] is blessing you he said that's not
[40:06] always true sometimes it's the other way
[40:08] so we know we're not to longer to just
[40:11] look at a temporary blessing but God has
[40:14] something so much greater than that and
[40:17] and although you know these temporary
[40:19] blessings are needful
[40:20] amen and and we're thankful for every
[40:22] blessing that God gives us we're
[40:24] thankful for a car or a house or money
[40:27] to to pay our bills and all those things
[40:29] but to be truly blessed and I I did look
[40:33] up the definition of blessed and it
[40:34] really shocked me what bless really
[40:37] means you know and and if we're not
[40:39] careful we get the idea as we spoke you
[40:41] know speaking about a blessed means you
[40:43] know that just a carnal thinking of the
[40:45] word blessed but even the dictionary you
[40:48] know what the dictionary's definition
[40:49] for blessed is number one made holy
[40:53] consecrating Wow
[40:57] Amen number two one who God extends his
[41:01] benefits to number three endowed with
[41:04] divine favor and protection amen number
[41:09] four those who go to live in heaven with
[41:12] God that's the kind of blessed I want to
[41:16] be a man not necessarily looking for
[41:19] things here on this earth and no those
[41:21] things are necessary some and and you
[41:24] know but I'm talking about a blessed
[41:25] people and listen you don't have to be
[41:27] in the United States to be this kind of
[41:29] blessed people amen you might have to be
[41:32] in the United State you know people
[41:33] there's many people in the world that
[41:35] would trade places with the poorest
[41:37] among us in a heartbeat amen but that's
[41:40] not the blessings that I'm talking about
[41:42] but this definition you can be this kind
[41:45] of blessed person no matter where you
[41:47] live
[41:48] and I believe this is the one we ought
[41:50] to strive after and when we want to long
[41:52] Devoran what we're looking to be is a
[41:54] blessed person wholly consecrated a
[41:57] blessed person one who God extends his
[42:00] benefits to even a blessed person one
[42:04] who's endowed with divine favor and
[42:06] protection that's the blessings I want
[42:09] amen amen a blessed person those who go
[42:12] to live with God in heaven Oh hallelujah
[42:15] and I want to look at some of our
[42:17] blessings tonight in Ephesians one and
[42:19] verse three he says blessed be the God
[42:22] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[42:25] has blessed us with all spiritual
[42:27] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[42:29] so spiritual blessing that's what we're
[42:32] longing for that's what we're looking
[42:33] for according as he has chosen us in him
[42:36] before the foundation of the world that
[42:39] we should be holy and without blame

[47:26] the whole place so he's talking about
[47:27] just a kitchen you know or something
[47:28] like that so I want to redo it all and I
[47:30] said okay she says you're not gonna
[47:32] believe what happened since I went to my

[1:06:39] begin to preach and Jesus as far as
[1:06:41] physically wasn't even there anymore he
[1:06:43] wasn't there physically but he was on in
[1:06:45] here and it was time test and it was
[1:06:48] proved that would hold all the way to

[1:19:35] love having predestinated us adoption by
[1:19:38] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:19:39] according to his own good pleasure what
[1:19:42] a beautiful thought this is he's blessed
[1:19:46] us we're gonna go through some
[1:19:49] scriptures really quick you may not have
[1:19:52] time I don't know jeremiah 17:7 but it
[1:19:56] is the man that trust in the Lord and
[1:20:00] whose hope the Lord is Matthew 13 16
[1:20:06] blessed are your eyes for they see and
[1:20:09] your ears for they hear Luke 6:20 and he
[1:20:13] lifted up his eyes on the disciples and
[1:20:15] blessed be poor for yours is the kingdom
[1:20:18] of God blessed are ye that Hunger Now
[1:20:21] for you shall be filled
[1:20:23] blasting you that weep now for you shall
[1:20:25] laugh blessed aren't you you know what
[1:20:28] he's saying is bad more blessed a week
[1:20:30] now and it is to eat later that struck
[1:20:37] me so hard today you know just as he
[1:20:39] said it's a blend more blessed to give
[1:20:41] than it is to receive it's more blessed
[1:20:44] to be in the position to be able to give
[1:20:46] than to be in the position to have to
[1:20:48] receive
[1:20:50] a man blessed blessed are ye when men
[1:20:59] shall hate you
[1:21:01] and when they shall separate you from
[1:21:03] their company and shall reproach you and
[1:21:05] cast out your name as evil for the son
[1:21:08] of man's sake rejoice ye in that day and
[1:21:11] leap for joy for behold your reward our
[1:21:18] blessing is great in heaven for in the
[1:21:22] light manner did their fathers unto the
[1:21:24] prophets Luke 7 23 and blessed is he
[1:21:28] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[1:21:32] blast you blessed when the word comes
[1:21:35] and you're not offended there's so many
[1:21:38] people that get offended by the word the
[1:21:40] world is offended by the Bible they are
[1:21:44] offended if somebody happens to stand up
[1:21:46] for righteousness or what the Bible even
[1:21:49] declares they get offended I've never
[1:21:51] seen such a world of people so easily
[1:21:53] offended it's unbelievable you can't say
[1:21:58] there's not a person that can say you
[1:21:59] can't say anything without somebody
[1:22:01] being offended good or bad it's
[1:22:07] incredible the world that we're living
[1:22:08] and he's saying blessed is he whosoever
[1:22:10] shall not be offended in me Luke 10 23
[1:22:15] and he turned him into the disciple said
[1:22:17] privately blessed are your eyes which
[1:22:20] see the things that you see who glory to
[1:22:25] God John 20 in verse 29 and jesus said
[1:22:29] unto him Thomas because I see me
[1:22:32] Dallas believed but blessed are they
[1:22:34] that have not seen and yet have believed
[1:22:42] acts 20 and verse 35 said I have showed
[1:22:46] you all things how that's so laboring
[1:22:48] you all to support the weak and remember
[1:22:51] the words of the Lord Jesus how he said
[1:22:54] it's more blessed to give than to
[1:22:56] receive romans 4 and verse 7 says saying
[1:23:02] blessed are they whose iniquities are
[1:23:04] forgiven little glory to God and whose
[1:23:08] sins are covered blessed is the man to
[1:23:12] whom the Lord will not impute sin Oh
[1:23:17] hallelujah he said that's the way with a
[1:23:19] real Christian do you know a real
[1:23:20] Christian doesn't have any sin at all
[1:23:22] imputed to him David said blessing the
[1:23:26] man of God will not impute sin when
[1:23:28] you're washed in the blood of the Lamb
[1:23:29] not by make-believe but the blood of the
[1:23:31] Lamb
[1:23:32] God does not impute to you anything
[1:23:34] that's done because you're under the
