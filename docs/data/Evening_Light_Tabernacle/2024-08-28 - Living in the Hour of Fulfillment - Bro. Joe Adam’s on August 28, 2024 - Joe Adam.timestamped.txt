[40:03] Truth for this hour we just Lord we
[40:05] commit this service to you now father in
[40:07] Jesus
[40:08] name amen if you have your Bibles
[40:11] tonight we're going to learn we're going
[40:12] to look here in
[40:16] habca the Lord placed this thought on my
[40:18] heart tonight at the earlier part of
[40:20] last week and I was like well maybe I
[40:23] need a little bit more time studying on
[40:24] it a little bit more time studying on it
[40:26] a little bit more time studying on it
[40:28] but I couldn't get away from it so we're
[40:29] going to preach it to you tonight I want
[40:30] to speak to you on living in the hour of
[40:33] fulfillment living in the hour of
[40:37] fulfillment and tonight is I will not
[40:40] get through everything tonight but I my
[40:42] my goal and my intentions is to take
[40:44] tonight as a foundation message for
[40:47] Sunday and possibly a couple other
[40:49] services I believe brother Aaron and I
[40:51] will be splitting up some services in
[40:53] September and October so we have plenty
[40:55] of time for that but for some you older
[40:57] Saints this will be a refresher amen all
[41:00] right so don't check out on me don't
[41:02] hang up you just say Amen to the word uh
[41:05] because we're going to come out of
[41:06] scripture we're going to come out of the
[41:08] the message but I believe that it's very
[41:10] pertinent for us to help anchor our
[41:11] young people in the faith why we believe
[41:13] what we believe and recognize that what
[41:16] we believe is going to come into
[41:19] fulfillment and so tonight is going to
[41:21] be that night so we look here in habca 2
[41:23] verse 2 it says and the Lord answered me
[41:25] and said write the
[41:27] vision and make it
[41:31] plain make it plain what upon tables
[41:34] that that he may run that readeth it for
[41:38] the vision is yet for an appointed time
[41:41] but at the end it shall speak and lie
[41:44] not though it t wait for it come on even
[41:48] light wait for it though it ter wait for
[41:51] it because it will surely come it will
[41:55] not t God bless you you can have your
[41:58] seats tonight and we'll just kind of go
[42:02] through this and so we find here that
[42:05] habac had raised a question in chapter
[42:08] one and he's seeing all the destruction
[42:11] all that's going on to Israel in habca 1
[42:14] and verse 17 habca asked the Lord a
[42:17] question shall they therefore empty
[42:19] their net and not spare continually to
[42:23] slay the Nations otherwise you know like
[42:25] fishermen they cast out their they bring
[42:27] in the fish they clean it all out and
[42:29] they cast it back in and they do the
[42:31] same thing over and over and over and
[42:32] over so he's asking the Lord shall these
[42:35] Chans when they have conquered one
[42:37] nation and they filled their Nets and
[42:39] themselves they' they've gotten those
[42:41] spoil They Carried to the city of
[42:42] Babylon and there they lay it up and
[42:44] they come back and they throw their net
[42:46] out again they go and they plunder
[42:48] another Nation another kingdom and he's
[42:50] asking how long shall this happen and
[42:55] notice the Lord tells habca but it's not
[42:58] in everyday English probably wasn't in
[43:00] English at all that's right let's just
[43:03] be honest but we find here in habca to
[43:05] the Lord answered me and he said write
[43:08] the vision so when the Lord responded to
[43:11] habca he responded with that vision and
[43:14] so we find here the answer comes to an
[43:16] Vision through a a a revelation of God
[43:19] it was not only for Hab backa but it was
[43:22] for the people of God so we look at this
[43:25] and notice now he was committ mission to
[43:27] write the vision down don't make it a
[43:30] mystery but make it plain make it plain
[43:33] so he that runneth he can take that word
[43:36] or he can take the vision and he can run
[43:38] with it now that's not physically
[43:40] getting out and running with it the word
[43:42] run there means to announced by the
[43:45] divine revelation so he is going to run
[43:48] with this Vision he's going to go and
[43:50] forell and he's going to give forth the
[43:52] Revelation and here we find habca is
[43:56] being given this answer he said write
[43:58] this Vision down make it plain why did
[44:01] he need to write it down because it was
[44:04] for an appointed time there you go
[44:07] otherwise don't lose sight of this
[44:08] Vision it's going to come to pass though
[44:11] it t it will speak and so we find here
[44:15] God is bringing these things down and he
[44:17] said it must be recorded and it must be
[44:20] made plain and we find that being
[44:23] exemplified in Deuteronomy
[44:25] 27:8 it says says and thou shalt write
[44:28] upon the stones all the words of this
[44:30] law very
[44:32] plainly so God is doing something great
[44:35] so we find here tonight the message was
[44:37] so important that it couldn't be
[44:40] misunderstood it had to be made plain it
[44:43] had to be written so that we can take
[44:45] the vision take the message and run with
[44:48] it and declare the divine revelation
[44:51] notice it's it's a message of joy for
[44:54] the people of Israel
[44:57] after all notice the downfall of the
[44:59] enemy means Deliverance to Israel so
[45:02] when they see this and it's being made
[45:04] known if you go back in habca and you
[45:06] read down the verses four on down
[45:08] through the end of the chapter you will
[45:09] see what God is telling them he's going
[45:11] to do that's right but we want to look
[45:14] at tonight for the sake of building a
[45:16] foundation for our next fever several
[45:19] services and mainly I want you young
[45:21] people to really clue in here because I
[45:22] believe this is going to help you
[45:23] tonight but we look in habca 2 and the
[45:26] Lord answered me and it said write the
[45:28] vision so first of all we must
[45:31] understand what is a vision now this
[45:33] word vision is prophecy it means a
[45:36] Divine communication that is a dream a
[45:39] revelation or an oracle right yes
[45:43] Proverbs 29 and verse 18 says where
[45:46] there is no vision where there is no
[45:49] prophecy where there is no Divine
[45:51] communication where there is no dream
[45:54] where there is no Revelation where there
[45:56] is no orle of God the people perish now
[46:00] you think well they go to they perish
[46:02] they they die but it doesn't necessarily
[46:04] mean they perish and die it means they
[46:06] return naked they become naked they were
[46:09] without restraints yeah look Church look
[46:12] around in the society in which we're
[46:14] living in
[46:15] today man there's a people today that
[46:18] refuse the prophecy they refuse the
[46:21] vision and we find the people that are
[46:23] walking in darkness and they don't even
[46:25] know that they're naked
[46:30] but he says in Amos 3 and: 7 God has a
[46:35] pattern that he can never break that's
[46:38] right God has a pattern Amos 3:7 surely
[46:40] the Lord God will do nothing but what he
[46:43] revealeth his secret unto his servants
[46:47] the prophets so I'm going to spend the
[46:49] rest of Wednesday night dealing with the
[46:51] office of a prophet yes sir cuz to me
[46:56] it's to Crut of our
[46:58] message and to every one of us if we
[47:01] have a prophet who is proclaiming a
[47:03] self-proclaimed prophet and what he
[47:06] prophesies doesn't come to pass then
[47:08] we're most miserable
[47:09] people but as we're going to find
[47:11] tonight through the scripture and
[47:13] through the message we're going to find
[47:14] why we need a prophet why God has always
[47:17] ordained a prophet because the Bible
[47:19] says surely the Lord God would do
[47:21] nothing otherwise he's not going to deal
[47:23] with the people he's not going to deal
[47:25] with the church he's not going to deal
[47:26] with the na
[47:27] but what he first Reveals His Secrets
[47:30] unto the
[47:31] prophets and notice I want you to
[47:33] understand this before they can be an
[47:35] end
[47:36] time good Lord wake up tonight and
[47:38] realize we're in the end
[47:40] time before there can be an end time
[47:43] before there can be a return of Christ
[47:46] God has to send a prophetic message and
[47:49] a prophet messenger notice he sent
[47:52] Elijah John the Baptist before his first
[47:55] coming and therefore if the pattern
[47:58] Remains the Same he has to send another
[48:00] Prophet before his second
[48:03] coming and we find here in Malachi 3 and
[48:06] verse1 behold I will send my messenger
[48:09] and he shall prepare the way before me
[48:12] and the Lord whom you seek you shall
[48:13] suddenly come to his Temple even the
[48:16] messenger of the Covenant whom you
[48:17] Delight in behold he shall come sayeth
[48:20] the Lord of host so we know that this
[48:21] scripture has already been fulfilled
[48:25] Amen in John the Baptist we find in
[48:28] Matthew 11 Jesus referring to it he says
[48:32] Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
[48:34] concerning John what went you out into
[48:36] the Wilderness to see a reed shaken with
[48:40] the wind but went you out to see a man
[48:42] clothing soft rment behold they that
[48:45] wear soft clothing are in King's
[48:48] houses but what went you out to see a
[48:51] prophet yay notice I say unto you more
[48:54] than a prophet so he decare John was
[48:57] more than a prophet why because he was
[49:00] declaring the coming of the Lord notice
[49:03] the office in which John held was a very
[49:06] special office it was unlike any other
[49:08] prophets before him because he was now
[49:11] for running the first coming of our
[49:13] Messiah of Jesus
[49:16] Christ notice and he says verily I say
[49:18] unto you among them that are born of
[49:20] women there are there has not risen a
[49:23] greater than John the Baptist not
[49:25] withstanding he he that is least in the
[49:27] Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he so
[49:31] John fulfilled the scriptures regarding
[49:34] Jesus's first coming he was the voice of
[49:36] one that was crying in the wilderness
[49:38] and we know that God doesn't change his
[49:42] pattern because he says here oh Israel
[49:44] I'm the Lord thy God I change not now we
[49:46] spoke about that last time I I spoke
[49:48] Wednesday night the previous Wednesday
[49:50] how God doesn't change and we looked at
[49:52] it from the aspect of the supernatural
[49:55] to signs and wonders and miracles and
[49:57] and all those things but it also applies
[49:59] to the word itself so God can't break
[50:02] his own word he can't break his own
[50:04] pattern whatever God did in the
[50:06] beginning God has to continue down into
[50:08] the consummation right so we find if he
[50:12] had a a a prophet forerun his first
[50:15] coming of Christ then he's going to have
[50:16] to send another Forerunner that's going
[50:18] to forrun his second coming of Christ
[50:21] and if he was under the spirit of Elijah
[50:22] and the first coming then the second
[50:24] coming there was going to be a prophet
[50:26] with this Same Spirit of
[50:29] Elijah and we look here in Malachi 4 and
[50:31] I know this is very familiar with us
[50:34] Malachi 4:1 says for behold the day
[50:37] cometh that shall burn as an oven that
[50:41] didn't happen in Malachi 3 the world
[50:43] didn't burn over in John the Baptist he
[50:46] just had his head taken off and Jesus
[50:48] died on the cross but the world was
[50:49] never burned over but Church we're
[50:51] closer to that day just now brother
[50:54] Wayne sent something out this morning
[50:55] that Russia has threatened nuclear war
[50:57] upon the United States if they continue
[51:00] to meddle with the Ukraine war we're
[51:03] that close to the hour of complete
[51:05] fulfillment that's right and what I want
[51:07] to talk I'm not trying to scare you
[51:09] tonight this is a happy moment for us
[51:11] because this is what we've been
[51:12] believing for this is what we've been
[51:13] waiting on we've been waiting we're that
[51:16] close to stepp into a new body we're
[51:18] that close to stepping into the Rapture
[51:20] and be at the wedding supper of the Lamb
[51:22] we're that close to the hour of
[51:24] fulfillment and we're the people people
[51:26] living in
[51:28] it we're the people living in the hour
[51:31] of fulfillment look prophets and great
[51:34] men had longed to be in this day that
[51:36] they can see the manifestation of all
[51:39] the scriptures be made known in a body
[51:41] and you are that body and we are that
[51:44] people I say hallelujah tonight what a
[51:46] bride what a people we are to be living
[51:49] in the hour of
[51:50] fulfillment
[51:52] woo to be living in I know it's tough
[51:55] out there I know the world stuff but
[51:57] we're not looking at the world look the
[51:59] brother the prophet of God would say
[52:01] this you're always looking to say how
[52:03] bad the world
[52:04] is he said but you fail to see how
[52:08] strong the church is getting all the
[52:10] time oh messes after message we're
[52:13] putting on strength word after word
[52:16] we're putting on strength while we're
[52:17] getting stronger what preparing a body
[52:21] change but behold the day cometh that
[52:24] shall burn as an oven and all the proud
[52:28] man there's a bunch of proud people in
[52:29] the land
[52:31] today y all that do wickedly shall be
[52:35] stubble and the day that cometh shall
[52:37] burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts
[52:40] that it shall lead them neither root nor
[52:42] Branch so we understand that was not the
[52:45] first coming of Elijah or the second
[52:48] coming of Elijah in the me in the
[52:49] ministry of John the Baptist but unto
[52:52] you that fear my name shall the son of
[52:54] righteousness arise with healing and his
[52:56] wings and he shall go forth and grow up
[52:59] as calves of the stall and you shall
[53:01] tread down the wicked for they shall be
[53:03] ashes under the SES of your feet in the
[53:06] day that I do this sayith the Lord of
[53:07] hosts remember ye the law of Moses my
[53:10] servant which I commanded unto him and
[53:12] horb for all of Israel with the statutes
[53:15] and judgments
[53:17] behold now this is our message behold I
[53:21] send
[53:23] you so the message was never about a lie
[53:27] go the message has never been about a
[53:29] prophet all that he could be all that he
[53:32] was going to be but it says behold I
[53:34] send you the message has always been
[53:38] about you about God getting you ready to
[53:41] receive a body change getting you ready
[53:43] to dress you in the Robes of his
[53:45] righteousness to dress you in the the
[53:47] Vindicated word of the hour so that you
[53:50] can be ready for that day this day that
[53:52] he's talking about he's going to have a
[53:54] people that's going to come back and
[53:56] walk out on the ashes of the wicked we
[53:59] are that people Church we're the ones
[54:01] that's going to step out on the ashes of
[54:04] the wicked when it's been burnt over
[54:07] woo my my my I tell you what you better
[54:10] get ready better make sure your heart's
[54:14] right notice behold I send you Elijah
[54:18] the prophet he's a
[54:20] prophet before the coming of the Great
[54:23] and the Dreadful day of the Lord and He
[54:25] Shall turn the hearts of the fathers to
[54:27] the children and the Heart of the
[54:29] children to their fathers lest I come
[54:31] and smite the Earth with the curse now
[54:34] the church age book brother B says this
[54:36] so immediately after the coming of this
[54:39] Elijah the Earth will be cleansed by
[54:43] fire and the wicked burn to ashes of
[54:47] course this did not happen at the time
[54:49] of John the Elijah of his day the spirit
[54:52] of God that prophesied the coming of the
[54:54] messenger in Malachi 3 John but was
[54:56] reiterating his previous prophetic
[54:59] statement of Isaiah
[55:01] 40:3 made at least three centuries
[55:03] previously he said the voice of him that
[55:05] crith in the wilderness prepare you the
[55:07] way of the Lord straight in the desert
[55:09] highway of our God or make straight in
[55:11] the desert a highway for our God but
[55:14] John by the Holy Ghost voiced both
[55:16] Isaiah and Malachi in Matthew 3:3 for
[55:19] this is he that was spoken of by Elias
[55:22] the prophet saying the voice of one
[55:24] crying in the wilderness prepare you the
[55:26] way of the Lord make his path straight
[55:29] so we can well see from these scriptures
[55:31] that the prophet of Malachi 3 was John
[55:34] was not the prophet of Malachi
[55:37] 4 though indeed both John and this last
[55:40] day Prophet have upon them the same
[55:43] Spirit which was upon
[55:46] Elijah and he goes on he says now this
[55:49] messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations
[55:52] 10:7 is going to do two things
[55:56] one according to Malachi four is going
[55:58] to turn the hearts of the children to
[56:00] the
[56:01] fathers come on Church why are you here
[56:05] tonight come on why are you here tonight
[56:07] because your hearts have been
[56:10] turned all right that's part of the
[56:13] Fulfillment somebody's living in the
[56:15] hour of fulfillment things have already
[56:18] taken place we're already fulfilling the
[56:20] scriptures regarding the the Bride of
[56:22] Jesus Christ notice and know he'll do
[56:25] two things he'll turn the hearts of the
[56:27] children to the fathers number two he
[56:29] will reveal the mysteries of the seven
[56:32] thunders in Revelations 10 which are the
[56:34] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[56:37] it will be these divinely revealed
[56:39] mystery truths that literally turn the
[56:42] hearts of the children to the
[56:43] Pentecostal fathers so how many of us
[56:46] can say that that scripture Malachi 4 5
[56:48] and 6 has been
[56:52] fulfilled now the way you say that it's
[56:54] been fulfilled is because your heart
[56:56] been turned if your heart's not been
[56:58] turned yet you can't say you can't
[57:00] answer that it's been fulfilled but
[57:02] those that have their hearts turned back
[57:04] to the faith of what of the Pentecostal
[57:06] fathers of what he did in the upper room
[57:09] he's still the same doing it the same
[57:11] today God doesn't break the pattern he
[57:13] stays with his
[57:15] word notice he has to come and perform
[57:18] the word that was a lowed for him to
[57:21] fulfill so here we are today our hearts
[57:24] have been turned turned away from sin
[57:26] turned away from just religious
[57:28] organization denominational beliefs our
[57:30] hearts have been turned back to the
[57:32] original Faith the original faith not
[57:35] some fictitious not some put on not some
[57:38] man-made intellectual understanding of
[57:40] Faith but the original faith that was
[57:42] once delivered to the Saints our hearts
[57:45] have been turned back to that yes sir
[57:48] am notice in the Elijah 4 will be like
[57:52] the Elijah of old the Elijah of Malachi
[57:55] 4 will be like the Elijah of old he will
[57:59] not compromise on the
[58:01] word he will call right right and wrong
[58:04] wrong and he will be a
[58:09] prophet so that's why I want to deal
[58:11] with that subject tonight is a prophet
[58:13] notice in Hebrews 1 and verse one God
[58:17] who at sundri times and in divers
[58:19] manners spake in times past unto the
[58:23] fathers by the prophets so God has a way
[58:27] of breaking himself known God has always
[58:31] used a prophet let me just say this and
[58:34] we understand that the English word for
[58:36] Prophet today is Minister preacher and
[58:39] so God still has a way of making his
[58:42] word relevant for the generation in
[58:44] which we're living in and he does it
[58:46] through anointed Ministry and when
[58:47] they're ministering it's a prophecy
[58:49] going forth It's a revelation of God
[58:53] going forth to the people but brother
[58:56] says in modern events made clear if you
[58:57] hadn't listened to that message in a
[58:59] long time I believe it'll do you some
[59:00] good to go back and listen to it because
[59:02] I started looking at it going from I
[59:04] mean I went I've covered a lot of ground
[59:05] this past week woo uh but you look at
[59:08] modern events made clear by what
[59:11] prophecy that's right so you look back
[59:13] at the prophecy then you look at the
[59:15] Modern events you can understand the
[59:18] modern events and they're made clear
[59:20] because we can look back because we had
[59:21] a Vindicated voice tell us what to look
[59:23] for he told us what these things me mean
[59:26] and because we can see what they mean
[59:28] now we see the manifestation or the
[59:31] Fulfillment they're made clear to us
[59:34] they're not clear to everybody they're
[59:35] not clear to the Baptist they're not
[59:36] clear to the Catholic they're not clear
[59:38] to the the Buddhist they're not clear to
[59:40] the the Hindus and all these different
[59:42] other forms of religion but they are
[59:44] clear to the elect Jesus of Jesus Christ
[59:47] The Bride of Jesus Christ the word of
[59:50] God is made known and clear to
[59:53] them let me keep going now he says
[59:57] Hebrews 1 the Bible said God in Sundry
[59:59] times that's old times and in diverse
[1:00:01] manners wrote the Bible by prophets he
[1:00:04] wrote the Bible by his own chosen way
[1:00:08] well I didn't like the way God did that
[1:00:09] well you know what you don't have a say
[1:00:11] in it nor do I see he didn't have to
[1:00:14] write it that way neither notice he says
[1:00:17] neither did he have to save Man by Blood
[1:00:20] he didn't have to preach the gospel by
[1:00:22] man he could have let the Sun or the
[1:00:24] moon or the Stars preach PR the gospel
[1:00:26] he could have let the winds hum the
[1:00:28] gospel but he chose man and he chose the
[1:00:32] way his word came and that was by His
[1:00:36] prophets which were predestinated and
[1:00:38] for ordained being a part of God's word
[1:00:41] declaring the revelation of his word to
[1:00:43] the age at the time for the word of God
[1:00:45] comes to the prophet only never does it
[1:00:48] come to a
[1:00:51] theologian never does it come to a
[1:00:55] theologian so tonight you can rest
[1:00:57] assure I'm not a theologian now I'm not
[1:01:00] declaring I'm a prophet either but thank
[1:01:03] God I'm not a theologian but notice it
[1:01:05] comes only to
[1:01:08] prophets the word of God the inspired
[1:01:11] word only comes to prophets God cannot
[1:01:13] lie so God wrote the Bible by his chosen
[1:01:16] method and his own chosen proph or his
[1:01:19] own chosen prophets not the prophets man
[1:01:22] had chose but the prophets God had chose
[1:01:26] and there's a pattern model Vince made
[1:01:28] clear he keeps going he says now then
[1:01:31] it's
[1:01:32] Believers he says then it's the
[1:01:34] Believers they watch for the Fulfillment
[1:01:36] of what their Prophet said that's right
[1:01:40] that's one thing well bless God I
[1:01:41] believe God sent a prophet bless God I
[1:01:43] believe brother Brown's Revelations 10:7
[1:01:44] but what are you watching for what are
[1:01:47] you looking for you just believe in that
[1:01:49] because we're sheep and we believe stuff
[1:01:50] that we just automatically he because
[1:01:52] we're going to get into some of that
[1:01:54] later about how our Society uses
[1:01:56] propaganda against us but today we don't
[1:01:59] we're not saying that what I'm speaking
[1:02:01] as propaganda but we're saying when we
[1:02:04] received a Vindicated voice we're to be
[1:02:06] looking for the Fulfillment of what he's
[1:02:08] prophesying that's right and so then
[1:02:11] brother B tells us in modern events made
[1:02:12] clear then it's believers they watch for
[1:02:14] the Fulfillment of their Pro what their
[1:02:16] Prophet says and that's the
[1:02:18] identification that they are God's
[1:02:20] prophets so the Fulfillment of the
[1:02:23] scripture or what they're prophesying is
[1:02:26] the Vindication that they are sent from
[1:02:29] God they're not sent from a seminary
[1:02:32] they're not sent by mama called them and
[1:02:34] sent them they ain't sent by man's idea
[1:02:37] but they're sent by God Almighty that's
[1:02:41] right he says now because first they're
[1:02:44] inspired next they stay exactly with the
[1:02:47] word of the hour then that's his
[1:02:51] credentials see the world the people are
[1:02:53] watching for some little Outlet some
[1:02:56] little bypass some little shortcut but
[1:02:58] there is no shortcuts in the word of God
[1:03:01] notice there's one
[1:03:04] pattern one pattern he goes you must cut
[1:03:07] yourself and fit that pattern not try to
[1:03:10] cut the pattern to fit you everybody
[1:03:13] must do that that's the only way God has
[1:03:17] of doing
[1:03:18] it the pattern has to fit you not you
[1:03:21] fit the pattern right then he says now
[1:03:25] the believer is wait for that word to be
[1:03:27] confirmed see it was not wrote by man
[1:03:30] but by by the Lord God therefore it's
[1:03:33] not a book of man now he's talking about
[1:03:35] the Bible this is not a book of
[1:03:37] man somebody said well it's just some
[1:03:40] old Hebrew writings they would write the
[1:03:42] Hebrew write the letter that condemn
[1:03:43] brother M says now would the Hebrews
[1:03:45] write a letter that condemn themselves
[1:03:47] that's like you writing your in your
[1:03:49] diary and saying all the bad things you
[1:03:51] did today you don't want nobody to know
[1:03:53] your bad things if you're smart
[1:03:56] I'm hopefully I'm dealing with some
[1:03:58] smart people tonight not a bunch of
[1:03:59] dummies I'm going to write all this up
[1:04:01] so I can just you know crucify myself
[1:04:04] anybody finds this man they got me but
[1:04:06] no he says would the Hebrews write a
[1:04:08] letter that condemned themselves would
[1:04:10] that fine nation of Jews self stouted
[1:04:13] and Polished would they write their own
[1:04:15] iniquities condemning them own their own
[1:04:17] selves certainly
[1:04:19] not tell of his own sins how they went
[1:04:22] into ulry and how they committed
[1:04:25] fornications against God's word no no he
[1:04:27] says they would never tell that that
[1:04:29] proud Nation it's not a man's book it's
[1:04:32] it's a book of god notice and the man
[1:04:34] who sees the Visions or hears from the
[1:04:36] voice of God they never understand it
[1:04:39] many times themselves in many cases they
[1:04:42] they don't even understand it they just
[1:04:43] write
[1:04:45] it see man didn't write the Bible God
[1:04:48] wrote the Bible it's God thoughts
[1:04:50] expressed through human lips that's what
[1:04:53] makes it the Bible
[1:04:56] a thought expresses a word in the
[1:04:58] beginning was uh in the beginning was
[1:05:00] God's thinking he expressed it through
[1:05:02] the lips of His prophets and confirmed
[1:05:04] it by his servants so God does his own
[1:05:08] choosing that's
[1:05:09] right and thank God he doesn't choose
[1:05:11] the way we choose based on height or
[1:05:15] lack
[1:05:17] thereof based on looks thank God woo
[1:05:22] based on hair woo yeah yeah that's right
[1:05:26] brother L me and you buddy we got it God
[1:05:28] doesn't choose based on the
[1:05:31] outward appearance of
[1:05:34] man God chose you because you were in
[1:05:37] the thoughts of
[1:05:38] God and brother says now God does his
[1:05:41] own choosing by predestination chose the
[1:05:45] prophets for every
[1:05:48] age notice it now he fixes the nature of
[1:05:51] that Prophet to fit that
[1:05:54] age he fix fits the nature of that
[1:05:57] Prophet to fit that
[1:06:00] age see he fits his style whatever he
[1:06:03] does he fits him whether he's educated
[1:06:06] or Not educated he fits the gifts the
[1:06:09] manner in that he'll preach in the gifts
[1:06:11] he'll have and the message for that
[1:06:13] certain age God's predestinated that
[1:06:17] certain thing to happen and there's not
[1:06:19] another thing that can take its place
[1:06:21] see he predestinated a man maybe an
[1:06:24] ignorant man
[1:06:26] now look at we're our prophets a seventh
[1:06:28] grade educated Kian now I ain't slamming
[1:06:31] Kentucky people but seventh grade is not
[1:06:33] a high education no matter what state
[1:06:35] you're in but nevertheless when we dig
[1:06:39] into the messages of God go listen to
[1:06:41] the uh 70 weeks of Daniel blow your mind
[1:06:45] yeah I mean come on Christ The Mystery
[1:06:48] of God revealed go look at some of these
[1:06:49] listen to them and read them and wonder
[1:06:51] how in the world can a seventh grade
[1:06:53] educated man preach these deep thoughts
[1:06:56] of God because it's not his thoughts
[1:06:59] he's a Vindicated Prophet therefore he
[1:07:02] must speak what God shows him and
[1:07:04] declares and it's not for him but it's
[1:07:06] for the age and he fits that Prophet
[1:07:09] messenger for the
[1:07:14] age and the message for the certain age
[1:07:17] God predestinated that certain thing to
[1:07:19] happen and there's not another thing
[1:07:21] that can take his place he predestinated
[1:07:24] the man may be ignorant man he might not
[1:07:26] have predestinated him another kind of
[1:07:29] man whatever he is he gives him his
[1:07:31] class his gift his nature his style
[1:07:35] whatever it is how he expresses himself
[1:07:37] and whatever he does he makes the man of
[1:07:40] the hour to catch the people of the
[1:07:44] hour Hallelujah and God still does that
[1:07:47] today in the 5f ministry now people want
[1:07:51] you to stop having the fivefold push
[1:07:53] playing you know what I'm all about out
[1:07:55] push and play push it in your car push
[1:07:58] it in your home push it wherever you are
[1:08:00] but when you come to the house of God
[1:08:01] God's ordained a way he chose a way to
[1:08:05] make his word known to the people and I
[1:08:08] believe he fits the gifts that he placed
[1:08:10] here and even like Tabernacle to catch
[1:08:13] the
[1:08:14] people my gift may catch the young it
[1:08:16] may catch some of the old brother A's
[1:08:19] gift may catch some that I don't catch
[1:08:20] brother Tim may catch some that we don't
[1:08:22] catch but God he he directed The gift
[1:08:25] and he formed that gift to catch the
[1:08:28] people of the age what am I telling you
[1:08:30] we're are blessed people because God is
[1:08:32] not going to allow one of us to not be
[1:08:34] caught he's going to let the gifts that
[1:08:37] he put in this church to shape you and
[1:08:39] to mold you and prepare you and get you
[1:08:41] ready for the coming of the
[1:08:45] Lord God fits the gifts brother
[1:08:50] Aaron
[1:08:52] my makes the man of the hour to catch
[1:08:55] the people of the hour mama that's me I
[1:08:59] done been caught Hallelujah hallu I said
[1:09:02] I don't been caught glory to God there
[1:09:04] ain't a day I don't wake up and say God
[1:09:06] thank you for this message thank you for
[1:09:09] the prophet thank you for showing me who
[1:09:11] I am look I come out of sin I come out
[1:09:14] of denomination I come out of all that
[1:09:16] but I never was in it to begin with CU
[1:09:19] in the mind of God he saw me believing
[1:09:22] this and he sent a message and he sent a
[1:09:25] man and he had a gift and he caught me
[1:09:28] because I was part of the people of that
[1:09:33] age oh hallelujah hallelujah notice and
[1:09:38] at the end of the
[1:09:41] age y'all need to turn that clock around
[1:09:44] I got a long ways to go I'm like smoking
[1:09:46] the Bandit long ways to go I'm got a
[1:09:48] short time to get there at the end of
[1:09:51] each age when the church has turned to
[1:09:54] the world and sin and the Leaning upon
[1:09:56] man's interpretation of the word as ever
[1:09:59] there always at the end of the age he
[1:10:01] says have got it such a mess by the
[1:10:04] theologians and Priests until it's
[1:10:06] always messed up always their
[1:10:09] interpretation is wrong not one time has
[1:10:12] it ever failed to be wrong that's right
[1:10:14] he's talking about the the great
[1:10:16] theologians and he said their
[1:10:18] interpretation of the word has never
[1:10:20] failed but to be wrong every
[1:10:23] time and they he says and not one time
[1:10:26] has God's word ever failed but to be
[1:10:29] right because heavens and earth will
[1:10:32] pass away but my
[1:10:34] word let me tell you let every man's
[1:10:37] word be alive but stay with the word of
[1:10:39] God it's been Vindicated let me tell and
[1:10:42] it's being
[1:10:46] fulfilled
[1:10:48] Hallelujah brother B says in the church
[1:10:50] AG said this Prophet this Prophet
[1:10:52] Messenger will be in his nature and
[1:10:55] manners as were Elijah and John the
[1:10:58] people of of this Pro Prophet
[1:11:00] messenger's day will be as they were in
[1:11:02] ahab's day and in John's and since it's
[1:11:05] only the children whose Hearts will be
[1:11:08] turned it's only the children who will
[1:11:10] listen amen so wonder why some of your
[1:11:13] family members don't catch it cuz it's
[1:11:16] only for the
[1:11:17] children oh come on man that sh look you
[1:11:20] may have drug and sad and mully Grub
[1:11:23] today but to realize you caught it yes
[1:11:25] or it's caught you it's showing you it's
[1:11:27] placing
[1:11:28] you it's not for everybody but it's for
[1:11:31] the
[1:11:33] elect no he says in the days of Ahab
[1:11:36] only 7,000 true SE the Israelites were
[1:11:39] found in the days of John there was also
[1:11:41] very few the masses in both Ages were in
[1:11:45] fornication and
[1:11:48] idolatry look at the churches look at
[1:11:50] the people look at the society look at
[1:11:53] the world in which we're living in
[1:11:55] fornication idolatry
[1:11:58] sin but he goes I want to make one more
[1:12:00] comparison between the leot de and
[1:12:03] Prophet messenger and John the prophet
[1:12:05] messenger who preceded jesus' first
[1:12:07] coming the people in John's day mistook
[1:12:10] him for
[1:12:11] messiah there you go I want y'all to
[1:12:13] listen
[1:12:14] now John 1 19-20 and this is the record
[1:12:18] of John when the Jews sent priests and
[1:12:21] Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who
[1:12:23] art thou and he confessed and denied not
[1:12:26] but confess I am not the
[1:12:29] Christ now this last day Prophet
[1:12:32] Messenger will have such power before
[1:12:34] the Lord that there will be those who
[1:12:37] mistake him for the Lord
[1:12:41] Jesus oh my have we not seen that
[1:12:47] manifest when Paul there on the out the
[1:12:50] the the island there I me can't remember
[1:12:52] just read it in Ro uh in Romans just
[1:12:54] said they when he shook off the Viper
[1:12:55] and they fell down to worship Paul
[1:12:57] Paul's like no no no no no don't worship
[1:12:59] me I'm just a man that's right and any
[1:13:03] God called God centered real genuine Son
[1:13:06] of God whether he's gifted in whatever
[1:13:09] area he's gifted in he's not going to
[1:13:11] allow people to elevate him to a place
[1:13:13] that he doesn't belong because notice
[1:13:15] he's just one of the prophets he's not
[1:13:18] Christ but yet men were baptizing in the
[1:13:21] prophet's name men considered him and
[1:13:24] they still do today as being the
[1:13:27] Messiah we call it a deity spirit and
[1:13:31] it's very much alive in our day but
[1:13:34] notice now this last day excuse me this
[1:13:37] last day Prophet Messenger will have
[1:13:39] such power before the Lord that there
[1:13:42] will be those who mistake him for the
[1:13:43] Lord Jesus there will there will be a
[1:13:45] spirit in the world at the end time that
[1:13:47] will seduce some and make them believe
[1:13:51] this notice is at the end time amen
[1:13:55] seduce those to make them believe
[1:13:58] it Matthew 242 24 and and through 26 for
[1:14:03] there shall arise false Christ false
[1:14:05] prophets and they shall show great signs
[1:14:07] and wonders in so much that if it were
[1:14:09] possible they shall deceive the very
[1:14:11] elect behold I have told you before
[1:14:14] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[1:14:16] behold he is in the desert go not forth
[1:14:18] behold he is in the secret chamber
[1:14:20] believe it not he says but but don't you
[1:14:23] believe it he says now listen
[1:14:25] he is not Jesus Christ he is not the Son
[1:14:28] of God he is one of the Brethren that's
[1:14:30] right a prophet a messenger a servant of
[1:14:33] God he needs no greater honor bestowed
[1:14:36] upon him than that which John received
[1:14:38] when he was the voice that cried I am
[1:14:41] not he but I'm the one that he's coming
[1:14:43] after me
[1:14:46] right and see if the prophet was alive
[1:14:48] today I believe he would be sharing
[1:14:50] these same sentiments with these that
[1:14:52] are elevating him to the office of a of
[1:14:54] God that's right so let's let's can we
[1:14:58] go yeah we got plenty of time so let's
[1:15:00] look at this what is a prophet brother
[1:15:02] Joe good I'm glad you asked a very
[1:15:04] intriguing question brother B says now a
[1:15:07] prophet he's a Seer a vision Seer a
[1:15:10] prophet whatever you want to call it he
[1:15:12] said a prophet is a compound word just
[1:15:14] like sanctification is a compound word
[1:15:16] which means clean and set aside for
[1:15:19] service and there's as many words and
[1:15:21] especially in our English words are
[1:15:22] compound but a prophet means to give a
[1:15:25] personal experience under inspiration or
[1:15:29] foresee something right so I'm going to
[1:15:31] take the next little while and we're
[1:15:32] going to break down every place
[1:15:34] scripture and message where brother B
[1:15:37] describes a prophet
[1:15:39] yes because remember that's the crutch
[1:15:42] of our
[1:15:43] message Malachi 4 has to be Elijah the
[1:15:46] prophet that's
[1:15:47] right our hearts have to be turned
[1:15:50] that's right and it takes a prophet it
[1:15:53] takes a man with a prophetic gift gift
[1:15:55] not just any prophetic gift but a a
[1:15:58] genuine a a genuine gift of a major
[1:16:01] prophet to turn the heart of the people
[1:16:03] not a minor Prophet but a major prophet
[1:16:05] to turn the hearts of the people back to
[1:16:08] the faith he says now there's a
[1:16:10] difference between the gift a prophecy
[1:16:12] and a prophet yes sir one is a gift of
[1:16:15] Prophecy the other one is a prophet a
[1:16:17] gift of Prophecy must be judged by two
[1:16:19] or three spiritual men so somebody
[1:16:22] stands up brother L you stand up don't
[1:16:24] do it right now please but and you give
[1:16:26] a prophecy it can't come before the
[1:16:27] church but what is first judged by two
[1:16:29] or three and brother B says it needs to
[1:16:31] be done in the back office so a gift of
[1:16:33] Prophecy has to be judged but a
[1:16:36] prophet doesn't have to be judged
[1:16:39] doesn't have to go before the people
[1:16:41] because he is the Divine revealer of the
[1:16:43] thoughts of
[1:16:44] God so notice a gift of Prophecy must be
[1:16:47] judged by two or three spiritual men he
[1:16:49] said It Came Upon one person tonight to
[1:16:51] be another person tomorrow night and
[1:16:53] another one the next night what is it is
[1:16:55] a gift and and he says it's a gift in
[1:16:58] every local body every church but a
[1:17:00] prophet is different they're born to
[1:17:02] Prophet they come up prophets all that
[1:17:06] they say must be true every time it
[1:17:09] cannot be recognized or or it cannot be
[1:17:11] recognized as a prophet in the office or
[1:17:15] or so it's got to be true every time or
[1:17:16] cannot be recognized in the office and
[1:17:20] brother M says notice here in the
[1:17:21] impersonation of a Christianity he said
[1:17:24] a prophet is a sear and he's referred to
[1:17:26] in the Bible as an
[1:17:29] eagle he goes way high in the
[1:17:33] air higher you go the further you see
[1:17:36] see I'm at a
[1:17:39] disadvantage why you laugh out loud
[1:17:44] sorry my goodness why you look at me
[1:17:47] when you say
[1:17:49] short but you take somebody like brother
[1:17:51] Aaron stature he's got me by an
[1:17:56] inch maybe inch and a half something
[1:17:59] like that but he can see
[1:18:01] farther don't mean he got better eyes
[1:18:04] just means he's higher up he can see
[1:18:06] farther and so he's saying now this
[1:18:08] eagle and he Compares his profets to
[1:18:10] Eagles because so the eagle sword is
[1:18:13] much higher than any other bird there's
[1:18:16] no bird can go with the eagle there's no
[1:18:18] eye like the eagle the Hulk hasn't got a
[1:18:21] chance in his sight the Hulk could he
[1:18:23] could not stand at the the altitude of
[1:18:25] where the eagle can soar he would die he
[1:18:27] doesn't he hasn't got the makeup that
[1:18:29] the eagle has and he says now an eagle
[1:18:32] he can go way high until he can see
[1:18:34] things that other birds can't see
[1:18:36] because he's
[1:18:38] higher and God is making the
[1:18:42] eagle made him for that purpose because
[1:18:45] his nest is higher than others his
[1:18:47] little ones is up in the nest but they
[1:18:49] feed on the ground so in order to see
[1:18:51] the storm or the trouble coming the
[1:18:53] eagle must survive he must go higher so
[1:18:55] that he can protect his little ones so
[1:18:58] aren't you thankful God sent you a
[1:19:00] prophet that could raise up a little bit
[1:19:02] higher are way higher than the
[1:19:04] denominations that they don't know
[1:19:06] what's coming they don't man they got
[1:19:07] planes coming falling out of the sky
[1:19:09] trains running off the road cars running
[1:19:11] off the road and they saying this is
[1:19:13] what it's going to be like in the end
[1:19:14] time we know that's not going to fit the
[1:19:16] pattern because we had a prophet Eagle
[1:19:18] raise up there and he prophesied and he
[1:19:20] showed us the things that are made clear
[1:19:23] modern events by prophecy that's right
[1:19:27] we don't have to fear young people we
[1:19:29] don't have to fear Mom and Dad we don't
[1:19:31] have to fear grandparents because why
[1:19:33] because we had a Prophet come and he's
[1:19:34] telling you this is what's coming but
[1:19:36] when he comes look up cuz your
[1:19:38] Redemption is drawing n be ready be
[1:19:41] prepared this is what it's going to be
[1:19:43] like but I want you to know when it gets
[1:19:45] in that condition when the hour of
[1:19:48] fulfillment comes to manifestation I'll
[1:19:50] come to snatch you out of hereo
[1:19:55] Mercy man what a people we
[1:19:58] [Applause]
[1:20:00] are God liking his Prophet to Eagle that
[1:20:03] would go in go in the mar the makeup of
[1:20:07] a prophet he's a Seer that in the spirit
[1:20:09] he clowns Beyond notice I like
[1:20:13] this he clowns beyond the emotion of the
[1:20:19] church he goes beyond the rhythm of
[1:20:22] Music he goes beyond the Clapping of
[1:20:25] hands he goes beyond the joy among
[1:20:28] Saints he goes beyond all that God
[1:20:30] brings him up into the real alone then
[1:20:33] he opens his eyes and he lets him look
[1:20:35] around and he see things that is to
[1:20:39] come he ain't based on emotion it ain't
[1:20:41] based on the music it ain't based on
[1:20:44] friendships it ain't based on the
[1:20:45] Clapping of hands it ain't based on the
[1:20:47] joy of the Saints but God lifts his
[1:20:49] Prophet up alone and lets him see things
[1:20:52] that are coming upon the Earth amen
[1:20:55] wooo he can bring them back down notice
[1:20:58] he takes them there so he can see things
[1:21:00] that are to come then he brings them
[1:21:02] back down among the members of the body
[1:21:05] to forell them of what what it is in the
[1:21:09] making so God that Prophet lifts up see
[1:21:13] things coming and he comes back down and
[1:21:15] he shares
[1:21:16] it to establish you on the faith so you
[1:21:21] don't have fear you don't have questions
[1:21:23] you don't have unbelief he establish you
[1:21:26] on the solid Ro revelation of the word
[1:21:30] of
[1:21:31] God and another place brother says now a
[1:21:34] prophet is also a gift of
[1:21:37] knowledge a knowledge is like an
[1:21:39] attorney who studies the
[1:21:41] books and I tell you you go look in the
[1:21:44] back of the message program and you see
[1:21:46] the books that your Prophet read yeah I
[1:21:50] mean you got to be a theologian to read
[1:21:53] some of those books but God anointed him
[1:21:56] to go in there and see what the spirit
[1:21:58] of man saw and pull out the Loose Ends
[1:22:00] of that so he can tie those things up
[1:22:02] and bring it all together for an end
[1:22:04] time
[1:22:05] people so notice he studies the books
[1:22:09] and when you go to hire an attorney to
[1:22:11] plead your case he's only taking what he
[1:22:14] knows and you're paying for what he
[1:22:15] knows to present your case before the
[1:22:17] judge and the gift of knowledge in the
[1:22:19] Bible is a prophecy which goes up finds
[1:22:22] out these things are to come and bring
[1:22:24] brings them back down but they must
[1:22:26] compare with the Bible with the
[1:22:29] book if they're not out of the book goes
[1:22:32] if they're out of the book then they're
[1:22:33] not received because the the judge
[1:22:35] judges by the book then the word that
[1:22:38] God has spoken before the foundation of
[1:22:40] the world it isn't that God speaks and
[1:22:42] says something to the prophet at that
[1:22:44] time I want you to get this now it's not
[1:22:46] that he speaks and says something to the
[1:22:48] prophet at that time it is that the
[1:22:50] prophet catches what God has already
[1:22:52] said so God lifts this Prophet up and he
[1:22:56] catches what's already been said and
[1:22:59] then he comes back down notice the
[1:23:01] prophet doesn't have his own
[1:23:02] interpretation of the word he's only
[1:23:05] saying what's already been
[1:23:07] [Applause]
[1:23:11] said oh
[1:23:14] my so the word he says then the word
[1:23:17] that God has spoken before the
[1:23:18] foundation of the world it isn't that
[1:23:20] God speaks and says something to the
[1:23:22] prophet at that time but he catch the
[1:23:24] prophet catches what God has already
[1:23:26] said for the word was before the
[1:23:28] foundation of the world God spoke the
[1:23:31] word and it's laying way out stretched
[1:23:33] out in time and the prophet goes up and
[1:23:36] he sees a Time coming so it's only of
[1:23:39] gift of knowledge that he brings down
[1:23:41] and puts it on
[1:23:43] paper now another place the revelation
[1:23:46] of Jesus Christ a prophet means a Divine
[1:23:48] interpreter of the
[1:23:50] word now I don't see you young people
[1:23:52] making any notes
[1:23:55] this is good
[1:23:58] stuff
[1:23:59] notice a prophet is the word we know
[1:24:03] that the word Prophet means a Divine
[1:24:05] interpreter of the word the Divine word
[1:24:08] is wrote and the prophet has a Divine
[1:24:10] spirit of God within him and you know
[1:24:13] the prophet in the Old Testament was
[1:24:15] called a
[1:24:16] God that's right how many many knew
[1:24:20] that maybe three or four of y'all
[1:24:25] Jesus said if they call them Gods it is
[1:24:28] it written by your law you are Gods if
[1:24:31] you call them Gods who the word of God
[1:24:33] came to the prophet how will you condemn
[1:24:35] me when I say I'm the Son of God and
[1:24:37] Jesus here in John 10 he's quoting this
[1:24:39] to the Pharisees and Sadducees in John
[1:24:43] 10:34 Jesus answered him is it not
[1:24:45] written in your law that I said you are
[1:24:48] gods and in verse 35 and if he called
[1:24:51] them Gods unto whom the word of God came
[1:24:54] to and the scriptures cannot be broken
[1:24:56] so he's saying you call them Gods who
[1:24:58] the word of God came to so he was
[1:25:00] actually referring back to Exodus 7 and
[1:25:02] verse one and the Lord said unto Moses I
[1:25:06] have made thee a God to
[1:25:08] pharaoh and Aaron thy brother shall be a
[1:25:12] prophet therefore a prophet is a
[1:25:15] mouthpiece it's God's mouthpiece to the
[1:25:18] age that's
[1:25:19] right it's God's mouthpiece to the age
[1:25:24] so that means that you and all your
[1:25:26] great intellectual understanding and all
[1:25:28] your time reading the Bible he's the
[1:25:32] mouthpiece to the age you don't have any
[1:25:36] right any say to critique to go against
[1:25:39] what that Prophet messenger has brought
[1:25:41] because he's the mouthpiece he's done
[1:25:44] raised up caught the Revelation and
[1:25:46] bringing it down making it known it's
[1:25:48] not up for
[1:25:51] debate it's up for you to line up too
[1:25:54] and believe it that's right notice he
[1:25:57] says now there never was in any age any
[1:25:59] two Major Prophets on the earth at one
[1:26:01] time there were many Minor Prophets but
[1:26:04] there was one major prophet and Elijah
[1:26:07] was the prophet until Elisha came then
[1:26:09] when Elijah was taking off a portion a
[1:26:12] double portion of Elijah's Spirit
[1:26:14] Elijah's Spirit came back on Elijah so
[1:26:17] God only had one major prophet in any
[1:26:20] generation there never was two on the
[1:26:22] field at one time Elijah and Elisha
[1:26:24] walked arm in arm but he never become
[1:26:27] fully a prophet until Elijah's robe
[1:26:29] dropped upon
[1:26:31] him and a prophet is a man who's born
[1:26:35] and predestinated and for ordained for
[1:26:38] that generation the Bible teaches that
[1:26:40] that's right by God's forn knowledge he
[1:26:42] sent a certain person for that and we
[1:26:45] find the scripture for this because I
[1:26:47] want to Bas base everything on scripture
[1:26:49] right so we go to Jeremiah 1 and verse
[1:26:52] 5 and it says says before I formed thee
[1:26:55] in thy belly I knew thee you go and
[1:26:59] before thou camest forth out of thy womb
[1:27:01] I Sanctified thee and ordained thee a
[1:27:05] prophet unto the Nations so in the forn
[1:27:08] knowledge of God Jeremiah was already
[1:27:11] ordained a prophet so he didn't just
[1:27:14] make himself a prophet he didn't just
[1:27:16] study enough to declare well know what I
[1:27:18] feel the call I think I'm going to
[1:27:19] preach no God ordained him a prophet
[1:27:23] that's right and so prophets are not
[1:27:25] man-made they're not just somebody
[1:27:27] thinking he's going to do something
[1:27:28] because he feels spiritual true prophets
[1:27:30] are ordained by God predestinated by the
[1:27:32] for knowledge of God to that office and
[1:27:36] there's only one major prophet to a
[1:27:38] generation that's right so all these men
[1:27:41] that's claiming they're the eighth
[1:27:42] messenger too late you done broke the
[1:27:44] scripture right because there's one
[1:27:46] major prophet to the age and according
[1:27:49] to the word of God he's going to be a
[1:27:51] Malachi 4 fulfillment and a revelation
[1:27:54] 107
[1:27:55] fulfillment cuz he's going to do two
[1:27:57] things the prophet said he's going to
[1:27:58] turn the hearts of the elect back to the
[1:28:01] Pentecostal fathers and two he's going
[1:28:02] to reveal the Mysteries which is going
[1:28:04] to prepare us for a body
[1:28:07] change now brother B says now a prophet
[1:28:09] for sees way off the things that is
[1:28:12] coming he sees the cup of God's Wrath
[1:28:14] full before it his
[1:28:16] field he can say thus sayeth the Lord
[1:28:19] God will destroy this city except you
[1:28:20] repent why he's an eagle he rides way in
[1:28:23] y under he looks way off there and he
[1:28:26] sees that cup of the Wrath poured out
[1:28:29] see that's what the prophets looks at he
[1:28:32] ain't looking down here he's looking up
[1:28:35] yonder he's saying it's coming he can go
[1:28:38] so high till he can see that shade and
[1:28:41] the world will be dark and darkness and
[1:28:43] gross Darkness he's up high enough the
[1:28:46] Sun's shining now but he sees the shade
[1:28:48] coming he's saying what he's he's
[1:28:51] looking at he ain't here yet or it ain't
[1:28:53] here yet but it'll be here
[1:28:56] sure notice that's right it's going to
[1:28:58] be here gross Darkness upon the people
[1:29:01] he knows it's coming years away but yet
[1:29:03] he sees
[1:29:05] it Amos that anointed prophet of God he
[1:29:08] saw the darkness and the Judgment he
[1:29:10] seen Syria come down with their chariots
[1:29:12] and sweep through there and Slaughter
[1:29:14] the people out he saw it coming and the
[1:29:17] Judgment of God upon them now 50 years
[1:29:19] before it happened but you see being a
[1:29:22] prophet he was lifted up into the spirit
[1:29:24] and he saw it far off he saw the cup
[1:29:27] full before it ever was
[1:29:29] filled and that's what a prophet does he
[1:29:33] sees the cup of iniquity filled before
[1:29:37] it ever gets
[1:29:39] filled we're gonna keep going don't
[1:29:41] worry the word of God comes to a
[1:29:47] prophet if you call them gods and whom
[1:29:49] the word of God come to John 10:35 we
[1:29:52] also find here in 1 Corinthians
[1:29:55] 14:37 Paul speaking If any man think
[1:29:57] himself to be a prophet or
[1:29:59] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[1:30:01] things that I write unto you are the
[1:30:03] Commandments of the Lord so notice what
[1:30:06] Paul is saying here if he's a prophet if
[1:30:08] he's spiritual he's going to say the
[1:30:10] same thing that the preceding prophets
[1:30:12] already
[1:30:13] said because he can't say anything of
[1:30:16] his own because he's only saying what's
[1:30:18] already been said but he climbs up
[1:30:21] higher notice God always sends a prophet
[1:30:23] the word comes to the prophet the
[1:30:25] written word a discerner of the thoughts
[1:30:27] of the heart did you all he goes did you
[1:30:30] did you always notice he goes the
[1:30:33] prophet being that he know that he was a
[1:30:35] prophet is because that the word of God
[1:30:37] discerns the thoughts in the heart for
[1:30:39] tell things he's a fourth teller and a
[1:30:41] teller fourth did you ever take the
[1:30:43] dictionary the old Hebrew dictionary and
[1:30:45] see what the word sear means it's the
[1:30:48] one that has a divine revelation of the
[1:30:50] written word and how it's Vindicated he
[1:30:53] foresees things that he foretells and
[1:30:56] they come to
[1:30:58] pass so I will say this if the things
[1:31:02] that we believe have not come to pass
[1:31:06] then let's just shut the doors put the
[1:31:08] chains on and let's leave let's just go
[1:31:10] to some other church but what I'm
[1:31:12] preaching to you tonight is we're living
[1:31:13] in the hour of
[1:31:16] fulfillment the things that we believe
[1:31:19] we have seen with our own eyes in our
[1:31:21] own generation becoming part of that
[1:31:23] fulfillment we're seeing look brother
[1:31:25] Tim had sent a a quote out the other day
[1:31:28] or a question out to a lot of US
[1:31:29] minister the other day who's got the
[1:31:30] green Checker
[1:31:32] chirk oh come on wake up somebody
[1:31:35] recognize the day in which we're living
[1:31:37] somebody's got the green chcken shirt on
[1:31:40] we're living in the hour we're walking
[1:31:42] in
[1:31:44] division time is closing in but don't be
[1:31:47] fearful don't worry because in the
[1:31:49] moment you think not that's when he's
[1:31:51] coming and he's going to snatch his
[1:31:53] waiting R away because why she's not
[1:31:55] looking at man she's looking at the word
[1:31:58] constantly looking at the word looking
[1:32:00] at the prophecy looking at the vision oh
[1:32:02] let me tell you church when he said in
[1:32:04] habca he said you wait for it you wait
[1:32:07] for it in the end time it will speak
[1:32:10] otherwise it will manifest what I
[1:32:12] declare though it ter wait for it it
[1:32:15] will come to pass I said Oh Glory to God
[1:32:18] tonight at evenight Tabernacle we are a
[1:32:20] people that is looking to the vision and
[1:32:23] we're waiting for fulfillment and we're
[1:32:25] walking into the vision and we're
[1:32:26] walking into the Fulfillment of it we're
[1:32:29] living in that
[1:32:30] [Applause]
[1:32:33] day I don't want you to have any
[1:32:35] questions about this
[1:32:38] message you may have been sitting here
[1:32:40] for 25 30 years you may have just
[1:32:43] started coming six months ago but I
[1:32:45] don't want you to have any qualms any
[1:32:47] questions about this m it is Vindicated
[1:32:51] Vindicated by the scriptures it ain't
[1:32:54] Vindicated by man it's Vindicated by
[1:32:56] almighty
[1:32:58] God and that's why we're here because
[1:33:00] our hearts have been turned whether
[1:33:02] we're young whether we're old we met God
[1:33:05] and God snatched us out of this the life
[1:33:07] that we've been living and maybe you're
[1:33:09] here tonight and you're backl I'm here
[1:33:10] to tell you tonight you ain't got to
[1:33:12] stay in that condition there's been a
[1:33:14] word spoke there's been a prophecy spoke
[1:33:17] that the Sons and Daughters of God shall
[1:33:19] return home oh let me tell you Church in
[1:33:22] 1948 they came back to the Homeland for
[1:33:25] an AIA there's got to be a bride getting
[1:33:28] back in the homeland of the word for her
[1:33:31] aah and what happens first he sends a
[1:33:36] prophet divinely
[1:33:43] Vindicated numbers 12 and verse
[1:33:45] 6 can I keep going
[1:33:48] please I don't know how much more I got
[1:33:50] but I got to get it off my I got to get
[1:33:52] it done tonight so I can prepare for for
[1:33:53] you on
[1:33:54] Sunday numbers 12:6 and he said hear now
[1:33:58] my words if there be a prophet among you
[1:34:00] I the Lord will make myself known unto
[1:34:03] him in a
[1:34:05] vision and will'll speak unto him in a
[1:34:10] dream oh my and brother B talks about
[1:34:14] this and I may get to it here in just a
[1:34:15] little bit he talked about how a prophet
[1:34:18] he never falls asleep completely but
[1:34:20] he's in his subconscious he's dreaming
[1:34:22] so he's seeing things
[1:34:24] and he's able to see addresses he's able
[1:34:25] to see names he's able to see things
[1:34:28] that the the common man never sees
[1:34:31] because his subconscious never sleeps
[1:34:33] he's awake when he's seeing these
[1:34:36] things he says now in his unfailing
[1:34:39] words of
[1:34:40] promise if there be one among you who is
[1:34:43] spiritual or a prophet I of the Lord
[1:34:45] will make myself known to him speak to
[1:34:47] him in
[1:34:49] visions and if these things come to pass
[1:34:52] then it's God if they don't come to pass
[1:34:55] then don't hear him don't don't fear him
[1:34:57] at all but just ignore
[1:35:00] it that's what I'm saying so if the
[1:35:02] things that we believe hasn't come to
[1:35:04] pass then we just K to Barrow the door
[1:35:07] and let's just go home but what I'm
[1:35:09] telling you church it's been Vindicated
[1:35:11] it's been over Vindicated we got no
[1:35:13] reason to
[1:35:15] doubt I know it's not the mainstream
[1:35:17] denominations but my goodness you go
[1:35:19] look at what's in some of those
[1:35:20] denominations what's preaching the
[1:35:21] message in those denominations we got
[1:35:23] homosexuals we got lesbians we got gays
[1:35:26] we got the doors of of Christ is on the
[1:35:28] outside of the church trying to get back
[1:35:30] in but he ain't going to get in because
[1:35:31] they won't let them in cuz LBG Q is
[1:35:34] going to kick them
[1:35:35] out and you say you don't believe the
[1:35:38] message of the hour you want to go to
[1:35:39] that Tommy Rod God has Vindicated this
[1:35:42] message
[1:35:46] right notice but God's word is always
[1:35:50] right therefore that's how that's how
[1:35:52] they knew the man that was speaking
[1:35:54] whether he had the right revelation of
[1:35:56] God or not the Divine word that's
[1:35:58] written is because he had the word of
[1:36:00] the Lord come to him and it's no
[1:36:02] different to than our day today if a
[1:36:05] prophecy is given and I'm just going to
[1:36:07] say if a gift of Prophecy is given in
[1:36:09] the church and it doesn't line up it
[1:36:10] doesn't come to pass bring the person up
[1:36:12] here and get the lion Spirit off of
[1:36:15] them but if it is a gift of Prophecy and
[1:36:18] it's judged by two or three and it does
[1:36:20] come to pass then we must hear it
[1:36:28] but B says when God makes a promise he
[1:36:30] fulfills
[1:36:32] it that's the interpretation thereof it
[1:36:36] comes to
[1:36:37] fulfillment he goes if I promise you
[1:36:39] that I'd be here tonight and I'm here
[1:36:42] that's fulfilling my promise if I say
[1:36:44] I'll meet you in the morning and I'm
[1:36:45] there that's my promise there ain't no
[1:36:48] need of making any other excuses I got
[1:36:50] to be there so when God makes a promise
[1:36:53] then he comes around and fulfills that
[1:36:55] promise that's the interpretation of the
[1:36:59] promise but notice there is a vast
[1:37:01] difference between the gift of Prophecy
[1:37:03] and a prophet and we're going to look
[1:37:05] here in 1 Corinthians 12 and verse4
[1:37:07] we're going to look at these nine
[1:37:09] spiritual gifts that are being operation
[1:37:10] in every local
[1:37:13] assembly I'll try not to hold you too
[1:37:15] much longer but I'm going to get through
[1:37:16] with this tonight if that's okay now
[1:37:18] there are diversities in verse four
[1:37:20] there are diversities of gifts but the
[1:37:22] Same Spirit there's diversities of
[1:37:24] administrations but the same Lord
[1:37:26] there's diversities of operations but
[1:37:28] it's the same God which worketh all in
[1:37:30] all but the manifestation of the spirit
[1:37:33] is given to every man to profit with all
[1:37:36] for to one is given the spirit of the
[1:37:38] word of wisdom to another the word of
[1:37:40] knowledge by The Same Spirit to another
[1:37:42] Faith by The Same Spirit to another the
[1:37:44] gifts of healing by The Same Spirit and
[1:37:46] to another the working of Miracles and
[1:37:48] another prophecy to another Discerning
[1:37:51] of spirits to another divine or diverse
[1:37:55] kinds of tongues and to another the
[1:37:57] interpretation of tongues but all these
[1:37:59] worketh that one and the selfs Spirit
[1:38:02] dividing to all men severly as he will
[1:38:05] but we find the gift of a prophet we
[1:38:08] find that in Ephesians 4 and: 11 it's
[1:38:12] not a gift that operates among every
[1:38:14] local assembly right because it is a
[1:38:18] office not every Church notice Ephesians
[1:38:23] 4 ver 11 he gave some
[1:38:25] Apostles he gave some prophets some
[1:38:28] evangelists some pastors and some
[1:38:30] teachers for the
[1:38:31] perfecting of the body so not every
[1:38:35] local assembly will have an
[1:38:38] evangelist not every local assembly will
[1:38:41] have an apostle or a missionary one
[1:38:44] that's sent not every local assembly
[1:38:46] will have
[1:38:48] teachers and there you know what some of
[1:38:51] them don't even have pastors
[1:38:54] right but we find 1 Corinthians 12:4 all
[1:38:58] of these spiritual gifts are to be in
[1:39:01] every local assembly because it don't
[1:39:04] rest on officers men of God who call for
[1:39:07] those Stat or those places but God
[1:39:09] places the gifts in the body so there is
[1:39:12] a difference and brother B goes here now
[1:39:14] a prophet if you look that word up a
[1:39:16] prophet is a spokesman for another he's
[1:39:18] an interpreter for a deity a prophet
[1:39:20] he's a
[1:39:21] Seer so there's n spiritual gifts that
[1:39:24] operate through the body he goes now one
[1:39:27] one of them is a gift of knowledge gift
[1:39:29] of wisdom gift the tongues gift the
[1:39:30] interpretation all those things Gifts of
[1:39:33] Prophecy he goes but there's a vast
[1:39:35] difference between the gift of Prophecy
[1:39:37] and a prophet a gift of propety goes
[1:39:40] from one to another and before the
[1:39:42] church can even receive it it's got to
[1:39:45] be judged before three spiritual judges
[1:39:47] if it don't come to pass then it's wrong
[1:39:49] you got the wrong Spirit among you and
[1:39:51] he says now that's where the Pentecost
[1:39:53] people let down he goes I'm not to judge
[1:39:55] you he goes but you got Haywire on that
[1:39:57] you better watch them things that they
[1:39:59] absolutely be done decently in order and
[1:40:02] when the message goes hear it but them
[1:40:05] things have to be every word and they
[1:40:07] saying those gifts of prophec they have
[1:40:08] to be every word truth if it doesn't
[1:40:11] that person that goes to the altar get
[1:40:13] that evil spirit off them God don't
[1:40:15] don't lie God tells the truth then you
[1:40:18] have the church in
[1:40:19] order so we find here there's difference
[1:40:22] there God never change he always does it
[1:40:25] the same the coming of a prophet is a
[1:40:27] sign that God is ready to speak that's
[1:40:32] right God is ready to speak the Bible
[1:40:35] said God himself he did nothing until he
[1:40:37] revealed it Amos 3:7 to his servants the
[1:40:40] prophets that's right he does it through
[1:40:42] them because it comes to him that's his
[1:40:44] servants you know all right the coming
[1:40:46] of a prophet is a sign that's overlooked
[1:40:49] by the people every
[1:40:51] time so why are our message churches
[1:40:54] bigger than what they are because the
[1:40:56] prophets
[1:40:58] overlooked the prophets overlooked the
[1:41:00] office of a prophet is overlooked they
[1:41:03] may have their Bishops they may have
[1:41:06] their hierarchy in the church but the
[1:41:08] office of a Vindicated Prophet is
[1:41:10] overlooked because they claim God
[1:41:11] doesn't do that anymore right but you
[1:41:14] find in the old the New Testament even
[1:41:16] Jesus and Paul even speaks about the
[1:41:18] prophets in the New Testament so we
[1:41:21] understand though but let's keep going
[1:41:23] the coming of a prophet is a sign that's
[1:41:25] overlooked by the people every time they
[1:41:27] Overlook it they never get it let it's
[1:41:30] those who got their eyes open to see
[1:41:34] it so what makes you different than
[1:41:36] anybody
[1:41:39] else what makes you different than
[1:41:42] anybody else why can you receive the
[1:41:44] message of a prophet well some of you
[1:41:46] young people well we were just born into
[1:41:48] it no I'm trying to establish you on why
[1:41:51] we believe God's send a prophet because
[1:41:55] before God does anything and God is ever
[1:41:59] going to speak to a generation ever
[1:42:01] going to speak to a people he has to
[1:42:03] stay with the pattern therefore he must
[1:42:06] send a mouthpiece he must send a
[1:42:09] prophet yes
[1:42:11] sir and the coming of a prophet is a
[1:42:14] sign because it doesn't go with the
[1:42:16] nominations it doesn't go with the
[1:42:17] mainstream religious people cuz he's not
[1:42:21] going to line up he's only going to say
[1:42:23] what God puts in his
[1:42:25] mouth was that
[1:42:29] Micaiah where the spirit of God leave
[1:42:31] you know when it left
[1:42:33] me he I'm only going to say what the
[1:42:36] spirit of God tells me to say that's a
[1:42:39] Vindicated
[1:42:41] prophet he says now remember that he
[1:42:43] wouldn't be on the earth unless God was
[1:42:45] ready to speak and that's the way he
[1:42:47] speaks is through those channels the
[1:42:49] unchanging God never did do it any other
[1:42:53] way Hebrews 138 we put that off on the
[1:42:56] speaking in tongues and miracles and all
[1:42:58] that but God can't break the pattern of
[1:43:00] the scripture he's Jesus Christ the same
[1:43:03] yesterday today and forever Malachi 3
[1:43:06] for I am the Lord I change not and that
[1:43:09] word change there is disguise to diverse
[1:43:11] or to pervert he doesn't pervert he
[1:43:13] doesn't disguise he stays the same he
[1:43:16] stays with the original word
[1:43:20] pattern Hallelujah
[1:43:23] now a prophet is also a reflector of
[1:43:27] God some of you how many of y'all got
[1:43:29] mirrors in your house everybody should
[1:43:30] Bray their hands some of you should have
[1:43:32] looked at it before you came tonight
[1:43:34] just kidding just had to break the ice a
[1:43:37] little bit but you look in a Mir it's a
[1:43:39] reflector some of you go oh
[1:43:42] my yeah but some of you like mm I got
[1:43:48] it but it's a reflector it's showing
[1:43:52] exactly what's in the mirror and a
[1:43:56] prophet is a reflector of God so he's
[1:43:59] showing exactly what God is saying or
[1:44:03] catches that inspiration brother R says
[1:44:06] how many knows that a reflector doesn't
[1:44:08] reflect itself the reflector isn't the
[1:44:10] reflection there has to be something
[1:44:13] strike the reflector and the reflector
[1:44:15] to make it reflect and so what a prophet
[1:44:19] does he's not reflecting his own ideas
[1:44:21] he's not reflecting his own thoughts
[1:44:23] he's something has struck that Prophet
[1:44:25] just like something strikes a man of God
[1:44:27] today when he's preaching and he's
[1:44:29] studying God anoints him and strike
[1:44:31] something into his heart and what is he
[1:44:33] do to do he begins to study and God
[1:44:35] begins to pour out and he's reflecting
[1:44:37] to the people the thoughts of
[1:44:40] God so a prophet is a chosen vessel of
[1:44:44] God that cannot reflect nothing at all
[1:44:47] but he sees in a direct line with that
[1:44:49] reflection God to to reflect in the
[1:44:52] image of Christ word nothing else can do
[1:44:55] it you are a reflector that's the reason
[1:44:57] a prophet had to eat the book that's the
[1:44:59] reason he had to eat to scroll he had to
[1:45:01] reflect the word for that age and we
[1:45:03] jump over into Revelations 10 and verse
[1:45:05] 10 John saying I took the little book
[1:45:07] out of the Angel's hand I ate it up it
[1:45:09] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[1:45:12] soon as I had eaten it my belly was
[1:45:13] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[1:45:16] prophesy again thou must reflect what
[1:45:20] you ate John and John is a type of the
[1:45:23] bride therefore little bride tonight you
[1:45:25] got to take the book you got to take the
[1:45:27] vision you got to take the prophecy and
[1:45:30] eat it don't set it on the Shelf don't
[1:45:32] push PL and just leave it all all there
[1:45:35] at the church and you and you don't
[1:45:36] never have anything else no other
[1:45:37] anointed Ministry but you got to take
[1:45:40] that word and eat that word and reflect
[1:45:42] that word to the people your life is to
[1:45:45] be a reflection that God is
[1:45:48] alive it's got to be more than Wednesday
[1:45:50] night it's got to be more than Sunday
[1:45:52] morning it's got to be every wak and
[1:45:54] minute of every day that you live that
[1:45:56] the Lord Jesus is reflecting himself
[1:45:59] from our Lives why because we ate the
[1:46:02] book yes
[1:46:05] sir we can't help but bear forth the
[1:46:08] contents of the
[1:46:11] book the contents are manifest and a
[1:46:13] prophet is a reflector of God he's made
[1:46:16] so that he cannot speak his own words it
[1:46:19] has to be God's word that he speaks he's
[1:46:22] just like a a reflector and he is God's
[1:46:28] mouthpiece notice but in the days of the
[1:46:30] voice Revelations
[1:46:32] 10:7 another one of our famous famous
[1:46:35] famous
[1:46:36] scriptures in the days of the voice of
[1:46:39] the seventh angel when they shall begin
[1:46:42] to
[1:46:43] sound when she shall begin to sound
[1:46:47] notice it's to he when he shall begin to
[1:46:53] sound but saying it's
[1:46:55] singular one Prophet major prophet per
[1:46:59] generation he doesn't deal with man he
[1:47:02] deals with one and he says she it's not
[1:47:05] a she it's not a propheus but it's a he
[1:47:08] he's a
[1:47:10] prophet the first he says now first this
[1:47:13] age will have one prophet he talking
[1:47:17] about the leoty and church age now this
[1:47:19] we have one Prophet messenger Revelation
[1:47:21] 10:7 when he singer shall begin to sound
[1:47:24] there's never been any other age where
[1:47:26] God gave his people two Major Prophets
[1:47:29] at a time he gave Enoch alone he gave
[1:47:31] Noah alone he gave Moses alone alone
[1:47:33] they had the word through the others
[1:47:35] proph though the others prophesied John
[1:47:37] the Baptist came alone hey but now in
[1:47:40] this last day there is to be a prophet
[1:47:42] not a propheus though in this age there
[1:47:45] are many more women supporting are given
[1:47:47] the Revelation than men and and the
[1:47:50] infallible word says that he the prophet
[1:47:52] will reveal the Mysteries to the end
[1:47:54] time people and turn the hearts of the
[1:47:57] children back to the fathers he says
[1:48:00] there are there are always those who say
[1:48:03] that God's people are going to they're
[1:48:04] going to come together through a
[1:48:06] collective Revelation he goes I
[1:48:07] challenge that statement it's a BAL and
[1:48:09] valid assumption in the face of
[1:48:11] Revelations 10:7 now I do not deny that
[1:48:14] people will prophesy in the last age and
[1:48:17] their Ministries can and will be correct
[1:48:19] but I do he goes I do not deny that
[1:48:22] there will be prophets even as in the
[1:48:24] days of Paul when there was one agabus a
[1:48:26] prophet who prophesied a famine he goes
[1:48:29] I agree that that is so but I deny upon
[1:48:31] the infallible evidence of the word that
[1:48:34] there is more than one major prophet
[1:48:36] messenger who will reveal the Mysteries
[1:48:38] as contained in the word and who has the
[1:48:40] ministry to turn the hearts of the
[1:48:42] children to the fathers thus sayith the
[1:48:44] Lord by his unfailing words stands and
[1:48:48] shall stand and be Vindicated there is
[1:48:50] one Prophet Messenger to the age
[1:48:54] and on the basis of human behavior alone
[1:48:57] anyone knows that where there are many
[1:48:59] people that are even divided upon even
[1:49:01] lesser points of major Doctrine than
[1:49:04] that we hold
[1:49:07] together all right we're going to we're
[1:49:09] going we're coming to a
[1:49:12] close now who then will have the power
[1:49:16] of
[1:49:18] infallibility who then will have the
[1:49:21] power of of
[1:49:24] infallibility brother Joe not at all
[1:49:27] brother Aaron he's a great man great
[1:49:29] preacher but he's not
[1:49:31] infallible brother Tim we love him great
[1:49:35] pastor but not perfect so put any man
[1:49:38] you want to put
[1:49:40] there man in
[1:49:43] himself has come short of the glory of
[1:49:45] God but notice what your Prophet said
[1:49:48] who then will have the power of
[1:49:50] infallibility which is to be rest stored
[1:49:53] in the last age for this last age is
[1:49:56] going to go back to manifesting the pure
[1:49:59] word
[1:50:02] bride and it's more than just emotion
[1:50:05] because I'm showing you tonight there's
[1:50:07] a lot more to it than just jumping and
[1:50:09] shouting it's staying with the
[1:50:12] word but this word should produce some
[1:50:14] excitement because it should show you
[1:50:16] where you are who you are and whose you
[1:50:18] are notice now that means we have the
[1:50:21] word once again as it was perfectly
[1:50:24] given and perfectly understood in the
[1:50:26] days of Paul he goes I will tell you who
[1:50:29] will have it it will be a prophet as
[1:50:31] thoroughly Vindicated or even more
[1:50:34] thoroughly Vindicated than was any
[1:50:36] prophet in all the ages from En to this
[1:50:39] day because this man will of necessity
[1:50:42] had the Capstone prophetic Ministry and
[1:50:45] God will show him forth he won't need to
[1:50:48] speak for himself God will speak for him
[1:50:51] by the voice of the the sign what am I
[1:50:53] telling you and the prophet of God said
[1:50:55] God did more in my Ministry than he did
[1:50:58] in his own Ministry what was he showing
[1:51:00] that that was the infallible gift that
[1:51:03] God placed in that generation in that
[1:51:05] age that was going to do the
[1:51:07] supernatural by turning the hearts of
[1:51:09] the children back to the original
[1:51:12] [Music]
[1:51:13] faith that God spoke through it brought
[1:51:16] it to
[1:51:19] fulfillment that's right so revelation
[1:51:22] 10 shows that the seventh Angel's
[1:51:24] message will be a person in the last
[1:51:26] days anointed of the of God for a
[1:51:28] Ministry just like Elijah the
[1:51:31] prophet as is predicted in Malachi 4 to
[1:51:34] reveal the true word of the
[1:51:37] original God in this generation the
[1:51:39] original word of God in this generation
[1:51:42] so the messenger of Malachi
[1:51:46] 4 and the messenger are the angel of
[1:51:49] Revelations
[1:51:50] 10:7 they are one and the same yes right
[1:51:56] so brother Joe I need to I need a quote
[1:51:58] good I'm glad you asked they asked
[1:51:59] brother brandom a question answer 1964
[1:52:01] is a seventh angel as spokes or spoken
[1:52:05] of in Revelations 10 is he the same
[1:52:08] person as Elijah of Malachi
[1:52:11] 4 yes it's the same
[1:52:14] person he didn't go in a big debate
[1:52:16] about it yes he's the same person so if
[1:52:20] let me just ask you how many of your
[1:52:21] hearts have been
[1:52:23] turned how many of your hearts have been
[1:52:26] turned so we're living in the hour of
[1:52:29] fulfillment so if your heart has been
[1:52:31] turned and the messenger of Malachi 4
[1:52:35] and the the angel of Revelations 10:7
[1:52:37] are the one and the same then Revelation
[1:52:40] 10:7 has to be fulfilled just like
[1:52:43] Malachi 4 has been revealed because your
[1:52:46] heart has been turned and therefore
[1:52:48] there had to be a voice in the end time
[1:52:50] and he come and He restored all the L
[1:52:52] sins and he broke the seals there and he
[1:52:55] made known all the Mysteries the mystery
[1:52:57] of the baptism the mystery of serpent se
[1:53:00] he made known the mysteries of God
[1:53:01] there's nothing left church all the
[1:53:05] mysteries of God have been made known by
[1:53:07] The One messenger and he's a prophet
[1:53:09] Messenger to the
[1:53:10] Ang he's God sent God revealed God
[1:53:14] Vindicated for a generation don't you
[1:53:17] ever worry and question this message
[1:53:19] don't you don't you get a back up on
[1:53:22] sharing somebody what you believe God
[1:53:24] has Vindicated this
[1:53:26] word they may not see it but you see
[1:53:30] it they may never come unto the
[1:53:33] understanding that you have but blessed
[1:53:34] are your eyes for they see and your ears
[1:53:37] for they hear we're living musicians
[1:53:40] come in the hour of
[1:53:44] fulfillment and how does God start the
[1:53:47] fulfilling he sends a voice he sends a
[1:53:51] prophet and he vindicates it over and
[1:53:54] over and over and over and over and
[1:53:58] over so you will never doubt so you'll
[1:54:01] never question so Satan can never put it
[1:54:04] in your mind well what about this he
[1:54:05] missed here he never
[1:54:08] missed because it wasn't his
[1:54:11] thoughts and it's not his message but
[1:54:14] it's
[1:54:16] God's so Malachi 4 5 and six fulfilled
[1:54:23] and I ask you if it's not William
[1:54:26] brandham if it's not William brandham
[1:54:29] then who that's right come on you doubs
[1:54:32] out there if it's not William Brandon
[1:54:34] then who if it's not now then when we're
[1:54:37] closer than we've ever been to the
[1:54:39] coming of the Lord and somebody has to
[1:54:41] have their hearts turned back so if it's
[1:54:44] not William Brown they tell me where
[1:54:45] he's at I'm going to follow that man but
[1:54:47] as long as you can't show me where he's
[1:54:49] at I'm going to stay with the Vindicated
[1:54:50] voice I'm going to stay with the message
[1:54:52] of this hour because for me my heart has
[1:54:56] been turned my life has been changed I'm
[1:54:58] walking in tun with the word of
[1:55:01] God Luke 17:30 as it was in the days of
[1:55:05] Sodom or in the days of Noah what was it
[1:55:09] in the days of Noah man they was in a
[1:55:10] solom condition I you got to be blind
[1:55:13] DEA and dumb if you ain't realize where
[1:55:15] we living today lgbtq has done got into
[1:55:19] the pulpit they done got into the
[1:55:20] educational system they got into the
[1:55:23] politics everywhere you go you bump into
[1:55:25] them every if you go to Walmart that's
[1:55:27] right solom is all around
[1:55:31] us oh but what happened in that day when
[1:55:35] the son of man when the son of man is
[1:55:38] being revealed woo a prophet on the
[1:55:42] scene Discerning thoughts and intents of
[1:55:45] the heart making known the mind of God
[1:55:49] that's
[1:55:50] right Revelations 3 20 and
[1:55:53] 21
[1:55:55] fulfilled Jesus Christ is on the outside
[1:55:58] of his own church
[1:56:01] knocking trying to get back
[1:56:04] in but he can't because they done kicked
[1:56:07] him out because now they done put bobbed
[1:56:10] hair lesbians up behind the pulpit
[1:56:12] anybody can
[1:56:14] come they preach a message of acceptance
[1:56:17] but let me just say if it was an
[1:56:18] Abomination then it's an Abomination
[1:56:20] today God never changed
[1:56:25] fulfilled Revelations 10:7 as I said
[1:56:28] earlier Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 same
[1:56:30] so if Malachi 4 has been revealed
[1:56:33] Revelation 10 revealed let me tell you
[1:56:36] Church the seals are
[1:56:38] open all
[1:56:41] seven open if number seven is not open
[1:56:45] then William Brandon was not that
[1:56:46] messenger that's right because what he
[1:56:49] will do will reveal those divinely
[1:56:51] revealed secrets that were contained in
[1:56:53] the seals so he must that angel that
[1:56:57] messenger must reveal all Seven Seals
[1:57:00] and it's done fulfilled we're living in
[1:57:03] the hour of
[1:57:06] fulfillment Zechariah 12 verse 2 and 3
[1:57:11] Israel back in her Homeland
[1:57:14] 1948 raised a flag in
[1:57:17] 1947 but oh brother Joe what are you
[1:57:20] talking about she's a burdensome

[1:57:38] South Africa turkey have recalled their
[1:57:40] ambassadors from Israel citing the
[1:57:42] Israeli actions during the war the US
[1:57:45] President Joe Biden has warned that
[1:57:46] Israel risk losing international support
[1:57:49] over its indiscriminate bombing of
[1:57:51] civilians in the against Hamas in the
[1:57:53] besed Gaza
[1:57:56] Strip Biden also suggested that the US
[1:57:59] views Israel Israel's government as
[1:58:04] extreme
[1:58:06] extreme normally we put that word they
[1:58:09] put that word extreme on
[1:58:12] terrorists
[1:58:14] uncontrollable
[1:58:16] unmanageable and then we find some of
[1:58:19] Israel's closest European allies press
[1:58:21] for a ceasefire fire in the war with
[1:58:23] Hamas on Sunday underscoring growing
[1:58:25] International unease with the
[1:58:27] devastating impact of the conflict of

[1:58:32] population so Israel becoming a
