the age and we'll see this as we look into it tonight is to be lukewarm and everything around you tries to put that fire out and the challenge is to keep it going now how do you keep the fire going you got to keep putting wood on the fire you got to keep feeding the fire with something that's going to burn and that's the thing and and we get into it a lot with young people is you know well what's wrong with this what's wrong with that what's wrong and there's a lot there's a whole lot of things out there that aren't wrong we're not the fun police and we're not here to say don't have fun and don't do this and don't have entertainment but the question is is is what you're throwing on the fire making you burn bright is it keeping it alive there's only so much entertainment you can throw on the fire there's only so much decent movies you can throw on the Fire and the fire stay lit you got to keep the fire going and that's that's the challenge you know because and we'll get to it later I don't want to get too far ahead of myself but brother brandom said this bride will by no means be a lukewarm Leo to We Can't be lukewarm about this word we got to be a fire burning bright for the whole world to see amen amen let's go to him in prayer before we read the scripture tonight father Lord we thank you Lord for these young people and every adult Lord everyone that's come out and gathered with us on this Friday night to look into your word Lord as as our brother Michael said may it not just we look at as just the Bible study but Lord this is your word this is this is the message of the hour Lord may it light a fire lord may may we have a passion for it may you just reveal to us maybe something we haven't seen before bring to our remembrance Lord Lord just something that would ignite that fire within us and and Lord turn us away from from things that are putting out the fire in our life father Lord I just pray pray you'll reveal yourself to us that you'll speak through us tonight Lord help me step aside and and Lord just be used by you to to speak to the needs of your people and Lord may it not just be a time of learning but may Revelation strike our hearts tonight I pray father Lord we commit it to you now in Jesus name amen amen amen while you're still standing we're going to we're going to go ahead and read read our scripture it's so wonderful to have each and one of you here tonight I know there's many that are that are out and there's others are traveling and things but you you have all come and showed up and I appreciate that and your support and we just want to look into the good things of God tonight amen and we've been on this journey through the church ages I know it's been a minute since we've had one of these but we've made it to the leodan age that's your age that's where we're at so we're no longer looking back in history but we're looking to see if we can recognize our day and recognize our message amen so we're going to look here in Revelation 3 and verse 14 we'll read down through the 22nd verse 314 down through the 22nd verse and it says and un the angel of the Church of the leans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot not I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest me be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see and as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and I will suck with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen I pray that the Lord will add His blessings as you have your seats amen as we usually do just a a moment of review and and and hopefully I I understand the busyness of life but hopefully as we prepare for these uh services that you are reading through the church age book yourself because there's so much in there that we we can't necessarily cover we try to hit the highlights and break it down into portions that's easy to understand but hopefully you're reading this and feeding on this yourself and just want to start a little bit with a review of the ages things that we have covered and talked about as we've gone through this study and we started with the Ephesian age and we learned that that messenger was Paul and then we went to the sman age and it was irenius and the pergan age Martin the tyan age Columba the sardan age Luther Philadelphian age Wesley so these are the ages that we have covered and and The Messengers of each age that that we've looked into and and and and we learned that brother brandham told us there was a key that allowed him to know what each messenger was and he said it is the Revelation that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is and I put this slide up every single time we have a study and I want you to get that down in your heart that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and a lot of times you know we we apply that to the miraculous well God still heals and God still does this but we also have to apply to to things God likes and things God don't like and and as the times change around us and we live in an Ever Changing World God does not change he is exactly the same as he he has ever been and brother brandham says that this is the key to the whole thing he says it's the Keystone of the entire Bible so like I said it's so important to remember in a world that never stops changing you you know something's cool one day and then a week later it's not cool anymore you know I taught middle school for all those years and and you you know these sayings would come and y'all know y'all y'all pick up on some of the slang of the day and all of a sudden there's some new word that nobody knows what it means except the youth and they're using it continually and then like three weeks later somebody says it and they're a complete idiot cuz man that's so last month and that's how quickly things change around you and and you're some you know you're not cool anymore cuz you said something that was totally cool two weeks ago but that's not how God is if he said it he still means it he still stands by he does not change and you can rest on his word and you can rest on his promises I for one am extremely thankful that I don't have to figure out what God likes today and then next week figure out what he likes God what he likes and his program it never changes amen and we've learned that that brother Brown said that the characteristics of the ages he says these seven churches located in Asia Minor contain certain characteristics within them at that ancient date which becomes M mature fruit in later ages so in other words the characteristics of these cities matches the characteristics of the age that they were chosen to represent and I know we've gone over this every time but I just want you to have a firm grasp of what we're talking about so we come to Lea you see it in the bottom right hand of the of the map here it started around 1906 all the way till present and we know that a leoda means people's rights and brother Brandon would tell us that it was actually a very common name and its meaning is people's rights or Justice of the people and there I spend a little time here for a minute and I think of how fitting a characteristic that this is for for this church and for this city to represent this age because there has never been a time like this time when it comes to the demanding of Rights well I have a right and we have a right and constant cries for equality and constant cries about Justice and and the political move of the day and the social move of the day is to make everything equal no matter how Preposterous it is think about it's not that we don't believe in treating people right it's not that we don't believe in treating people Fair no matter their race their gender or their background that that's not the point that that's not what we're talking about the point is what is the truth behind the movement what is the truth behind the movement you know the movements many times for justice or equality or fairness are actually just a front the movements are they're just a front the movement is the sheep's clothing that's hiding the wolf the movement is an attack on biblical standards and social norms that were formed by those biblical standards but the attack comes in a veil that that says we just want to be treated the same we just want to be treated fairly we just want equality and and there's so many different ones that we could look at but just an obvious one that I can talk to you about tonight just so you kind of have understand what I'm talking about just look at the push for women's rights and women's suffrage suffrage for those of you who don't know means the right to vote so just look at that push and that push wound up with the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in 1920 and it granted women the right to vote well what's wrong with that brother Aaron what's what's wrong with that see when you're judging something don't Jud just judge that something don't just look at it as simply well it was all about the right to vote look at what is behind the movement first of all let me say this women should be treated right sisters you should be treated right you shouldn't feel like a second class citizen you should have a vital role you're just as good and just as smart sometimes better and smarter none of that is the point even though that becomes the talking points of the movements that's not the point behind it but see the spirit behind it was never after the right to vote the spirit behind it was never about equal rights it was the elimination of distinction between the Sexes it was to weaken male leadership it was to the beginning of eroding of gender specific roles in society that is the beginning of it and and yes it is it is veiled in don't we deserve rights too and that's just the veil of it and and you know I look back and I was looking through all these pictures and I'm looking at what we would call in the day worldly women look at the way they're dressed I would say maybe more modest than a lot of Believers today these are the ones on the front lines of The Cutting Edge of women's rights why do you have to be careful what you're getting behind look at what it's led to today it was never about the right to vote look at the sign Mr President how long must women wait for Liberty and I ask you what has that Liberty led to what is behind the movement so so it goes from gaining equal rights to no longer being satisfied in the the role that God intended the the problem is and I will say this a lot of times movements come from the misapplication of Truth a lot of times women begin to want and I'm just using this as example there's lots of other examples but since we're here they want freedom and they want equal rights because men Miss Supply leadership and is holding them down under their thumb so so men it's very important that when we read scriptures about leadership and the role of a man that we understand how to properly apply that a woman is not a doormat for you to rule and Reign Over And if you do then it leads to a woman looking for equal freedoms and other ways of expression and things of that nature so a lot of times these movements are born from those situations I understand that but what it is it leads to no longer being satisfied in the role God gave you and now they want out of the home now we want the same jobs now we want to be in the military we want to be the police now we want to be Pilots you see how that's been working out lately and listen I'll say this I actually feel like women can fly just as good as men they just can't land now we want to be president until now we've reached the point that Mama isn't raising her children the daycare is or the babysitter is or the tele T ision is Mama's not there and you see the trick of the devil it never was that women weren't capable it never was that they weren't smart enough it was that God had set things up in a way for there to be a home and for there to be a Fifth Gospel and now it comes around and and they've achieved all this greatness and there's no Fifth Gospel and the children are being raised by anything but the gospel and the separation of uh has gotten to an now that the separation of indie any gender specific roles has led directly to the mess that we live with today the whole transgender nonsense the men can be women and women can be men and men in the bathroom with your little girls and men playing sports with the girls why why people's rights and you can't say anything about it because they have a right and they deserve a right and they have this right what a perfect name for the age we live in if you can't look at it today and and and realize that that this wasn't just brother Brown making something up that this Nails this age absolutely perfectly it's incredible to me so I want to tell you young people because many times if you look at just about any major movement pick one the hippie movement I I I I don't care any movement you will see talking points out there that make it seem reasonable you'll find Talking Points well don't you think that they deserve but that's really not the move that's the hook and understand that the target for these movements and you will see many more of them is you they're not trying to get the older people on board they're after the young people all right so when you see a movement and I just want to give you this word even if it seems worthy even if it in itself seems to be a Worthy calls make sure you look deeper into what is at its core what is it hitched to and I've heard it said like this don't just look at the horse but what wagon is that horse pulling what what's with it because many times things sound good but they cannot be achieved without the destruction of landmarks or Norms or standards and we're a people that we're supposed to have standards our standards should be different from the world standards our different it should be different than the Baptist standards our our standards should be different than the than the church standards of the world we're supposed to hold a different standard so don't hook yourself to a cause that makes you bring down your standards or identifies you with their standards for instance as time goes on you're going to see a push you will see a push and it's even going on now for for religions to come together so that we can all get along so that we can all be treated the same but I ask you how can a religion that seeks peace be one with a religion that seeks violence how can those two be equal or be one only by destroying what they stand for in the first place can they ever have Unity understand that about the unity that this world is going to offer you only by destroying what you stand for now can you ever have Unity with the world you can never have Unity with the world and keep the standards God has called you to and and and and and keep the word that God has called you to uphill the only way you can have Unity is for those standards to be torn down Le oia a destruction of everything so that value may be placed upon supposed unity and equ quality there's your a definition to hold on what is leosia it's the destruction of everything so that th you may be placed upon supposed unity and equality the city of leoda had a great medical school and and arts and science and they worshiped Zeus frequent earthquakes happened here f it finally caused the earthquakes finally caused its abandonment it was a city of great earthquakes once again how perfect for the age that we live in and the prophecy that this age is under and this age will end the age that we live in is going to end with with God shaking the whole world brother brandham says not only will World Systems crumble but the very Earth will be shaken and then renovated for the millennial reign of Christ this city was Rich it was it was full of culture science abounded but the earthquakes finally made it uninhabitable brother brandham says it in every attribute ancient leoda is found reborn in the 20th century in every attribute he says in the mercy of God May those who have an ear to hear come out of her that they be not partakers of her sins and the consequent judgment listen young people that you tonight by the mercies of God may you have an ear and and and realize you're being called not to be partakers of these things not to be partakers of the judgments that's coming and and we can't just sit in a place that it's same old same old same old to where you get you know you find yourself slowly getting led to sleep you have to recognize we're at the place where the earthquake is going to make this place uninhabitable where the wars is going to make this place uninhabitable where the nuclear bombs is going to make this place uninhabitable and you don't want to be one that's left behind moving on now you one of the things that critics will use and I just want to deal with this for a minute maybe you know maybe you don't know you know but one of the things that critics will use to try to discredit the ministry of William brandham is they will say that he prophesied that the world would end in 1977 and if you read this chapter and what we ask you to read you found out for yourself that that's not the truth this actually not true and in this next little bit we're going to show you the true quote and why the quote was made okay he says the layot ofan age began around the turn of the 20th century perhaps 1906 how long will it last as a servant of God who has had multitudes of visions of which none has ever failed let me predict now notice I did not say prophesy he makes it very clear I want you to know I don't want you to get this confused I'm just it's a prediction it's something I feel God didn't tell me this predict that this age will end around 19 77 now most of you are probably aware Ware of the seven continuous visions that brother Bram had in June of 1933 and if you're not we're going to go into that for a minute so you have an understanding and to me it helps bring about why the prediction was even made he told about these seven Visions throughout throughout his ministry and he based this prediction on these visions and the rate at which they were coming to pass they were happening very quickly they were happening right before his eyes and and he knew knew that they must all come to pass before the Lord returned and at the writing of this book The Church age book he States based on these seven Visions along with the rapid changes in other words these things are happening quick Vision One Vision Two Vision three vision four he's getting to the place where they've all been fulfilled and he's going it can't go much longer it's happening very quickly the these first Visions are are rapidly progressing I don't see how it can go 1977 he says the rapid changes which has swept the world these last 50 years I predict he says again and again he says I do not prophesy that these Visions will all have come to pass by 1977 now let me say this he says can anyone prove any of these Visions wrong were they not all fulfilled he says yes each one has been fulfilled or is in the process right now and so judging by that and and his own personal studies he says he he made a prediction and he made it very clear that it was a prediction he left no room for anybody to say he prophesied it's a prediction and and the Visions were being fulfilled so rapidly and it was all lining up and they were all coming to pass right before his eyes and he just couldn't see it going beyond that time but brother Aaron why 1977 well I like what brother Tim has said before he says it got so dark in the age that he just couldn't see beyond that year he couldn't see beyond that so he said that that's that's the end of it all because it was so dark now where does that tell you where we stand 50s something years into the darkness listen you better be a a fire burning bright cuz there is no other light in the world other than the light of this gospel other than the light of this message it it's the only light there is don't get distracted by the lights of leoa they'll lead you to destruction it is dark and the only light is keep your eyes on the word keep your eyes on the message keep your eyes on his coming because he may not have come in 1977 but you've heard it over and over he's come for for many and he is coming back when I don't know but I know I want to be ready when he comes back amen you know I just got to thinking about it for myself and I thought you know even prophets can Wonder and even prophets can ponder how will it be what what what's it going to be like when's this going to happen and and and and you they're not above that they're men like you and I and I got to thinking of Jesus's Forerunner and his first coming John the Baptist and you know and he declares Jesus is the Messiah and his whole Ministry leads up to his coming and then it culminates there in the River Jordan as he baptizes Jesus and now he expects things to begin to unfold and he has certain ways that he's expecting things to go and now surely the work's going to happen like this and and that and it's obvious that John had ponderings it's obvious that he had ways he thought it was going to go and how quickly it was going to go and it's all going to wrap up by this moment and then obviously it doesn't go exactly how the Forerunner anticipated and maybe even predicted to the point that he sends disciples to ask Jesus are you even the one he begins to doubt his own Ministry he begins to doubt everything because the way he thought it would go it didn't go prophets are are not Beyond or above ponderings and wonderings amen it's just a personal note brother brand I'm saying it's just a personal prediction I I have my reasons but this isn't a prophecy but I want to look at these visions that the lord gave him here in 1933 the seven Visions the first one was that mus and I condensed these so I didn't go into all the details of them museline would invade Ethiopia and that Nation would fall at his steps an Austrian named Adolf Hitler would rise up as dictator over Germany and draw the world into war now realize this is this is six years before any of this happens there would be three great isms fascism naism Nazism and communism but the first two would be swallowed up into the third communism The Voice warned watch Russia now I know you don't follow politics maybe that much or the the rise and fall of world governments but I've always noted as many others have as well that for many many many years the watch Russia part wasn't even in its proper place so to speak to where it could be fulfilled because and I don't have the exact dates in in my head but back in the early um part of the century Russia fell and became the Soviet Union and stayed the Soviet Union there was no Russia I mean Old-Timers called them Russia because that's what they knew him as but it was the Soviet Union all the way up to the early 90s it was in my childhood in my early teenage years when the Soviet Union fell and once again we have Russia we're standing in a place where that warning is very pertinent watch Russia keep your eye on Russia the fourth Vision showed the great advances in science that would come after the second world war fifth Vision showed the moral decline of the age centered around women she went into a state of undress and the vision showed the perversion of the whole world the sixth Vision there arose up in America a most beautiful woman I just copy and pasted this one straight out of the church age book but cruel woman she held the people in her complete power I believe that this was the rise of the Roman Catholic Church though I knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in America due to a popular vote by women and the last Vision the last and seventh Vision was wherein I heard a most terrible explosion as I turned to look I saw nothing but debris craters and smoke all over the land of America you know we sit here and you know and you look at some of these Visions like even uh the fourth Vision showed the great advances in science that would come after the second you know if somebody would have prophesied this in 1985 you might be like well well yeah you kind of saw it coming you know I mean computers were starting to come around and go back and look at what the world looked like in 1933 and then look at the things he he's prophesying about cars driving on roads automatically nonsense science fiction impossibilities the moral decline of the age centered around women look just bear with me for a minute let me go back and show you the women and he starts saying the women are going to be in a state of undress to where they're walking around wearing nothing and the whole world is going to go into perversion these were the bad women once again if this prophecy comes out in the 1960s even maybe during the the hippie movement you're like yeah definitely I mean anybody could probably see that come but to see it from here think about the some of the things that that he was saying here at this point in 1933 to the people of the time it would have been very strange it would have seemed outlandish but I'd like to tell you that it has come to pass they have all come to pass exactly and they have come to pass and they are coming to pass right now young people I want to tell you you can't be whistling past the graveyard tonight acting like there's nothing happening Visions are coming to pass the word is coming to pass the word is being fulfilled Sodom is all around us just as the vision said it was and I want to tell you the last Vision will also be fulfilled just today just today in the White House president Trump kicked out the president of the Ukraine after they had a big dust up back and forth over everything over there and he told him you're gambling with World War I and he had him removed from the White House that's today that's right now that's the time that we're living in on the edge of the final Vision you can't pretend it's not happening you can't stick your head in the ground and act like it's not happening we have arrived at the end time that's where we're standing in 1964 a great earthquake shook Alaska and brother Bram said that Good Friday earthquake of Alaska shook the whole world though it did not unbalance it but God was warning by a world trimmer what he will soon do on a greater scale he's going to blast and rock this sin cursed world my brother my sister and there is only one place that can stand that shock and that is in the fold of the Lord Jesus and I would beseech you while God's Mercy is still available to you that you give your whole life unreservedly to Jesus Christ young people the shaking is coming and the shaking is now and all that can be shaken will be shaken brother Aaron you're trying to scare me no I'm not I'm offering you grace and mercy tonight and telling you get into Jesus Christ the door is open tonight is an opportunity don't wait don't play don't pretend it's not happening it is happening and will happen in your day get in surrender everything because the Visions is coming to pass amen amen hey you can be scared or you can Rejoice it's up to you but that depends on where you're at if I was outside the Sheepfold tonight I'd be scared by it but once you're inside the ark brother Brown says let the storms come then let the waves come then we'll Crest every wave listen you don't got to fear it you don't got to worry about it just get in the ark and know I'm safe I'm secure I'm going over this before the bombs fall I'm going to be out of here get in there tonight and experience that peace the messenger brother brandham says I doubt very much if any age truly knew the messenger that God had sent unto it except in the first age where Paul was the messenger and even in that age many did not recognize him for what he was now as you read the church age book brother Bram does not declare himself the messenger in so many words but he does lay out exactly what the messenger is going to look like what the messenger is going to do and I'm going to say if you can read and have reading comprehension you can come to the proper conclusion the messenger of our day of the leoan age is William brandham born 1909 no matter what the trivia game said 1909 lived in 1965 I want to tell you tonight he's a Vindicated Prophet Vindicated by the pillar of fire it came down night after night and it said amen to what was preached the messenger to the age is William Bram but just so we can look through things and see what brother brandham says about the messenger we're going to go through some of it just briefly not not in the detail that could be he says the messenger is going to be a prophet he will have the office and the ministry of a prophet Vindicated because of its accuracy we can say Amen it'll be a word-based Ministry it will reveal what was was in the Thunders that was sealed up until the last day the fact that the Thunder that the seals have been opened tells you where we're at because it couldn't be revealed until the last day and it's revealed you're living in The Last Day scripture says Revelation 10:7 this is you know showing us this last day messenger says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servant the prophets brother Bram says this one here in Revelation 10:7 what we just read is the seventh age messenger and it is a man and he is to bring a message from God and his message in Ministry is going to finish the mystery of God as declared to his servants the prophets God is going to treat this last Messenger as a prophet because he is a prophet that is what Paul was in the first age and the last age has one too I say thank you Lord Jesus for a prophet Amos 36 and 7 shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in a city and the Lord hath not done it surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets so not only do we see the last day messenger here in Revelation 10:7 but we also see that the word speaks of Elijah coming before Jesus returns and I want to look at this in two places Matthew 17 and10 and and and young people hopefully what we can establish with you in in all of this is we haven't believed cunningly devised fables this isn't just brother brandham said or brother Tim said or brother these things are scripture-based these things are in the word Matthew 17:10 and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said un them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things what do we preach a message of restoration a restoration of the word Malachi 4 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse so it's obvious in the scripture that Elijah must first come people say you know William Brown on wasn't a prophet William Brown on William and I say then where's Elijah because Elijah must first come it's in the Bible you don't want to accept it as William brownon where's your candidate where's yours that was Vindicated by the pillar of fire Elijah must first come and he has a very specific work to do and that work is to turn the hearts of the children to their father father s now notice up here it says turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers brother Bram comes and he separates it he has a very specific work to do and is to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers because he already came first before the first coming of Jesus in the ministry of John the Baptist and turn the father's Hearts to the children so that part right there he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children that part was fulfilled in the ministry of Elijah in John the Baptist he turned the hearts of the fathers to the children now according to scripture before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord just before the world Burns Elijah must come again he says the reason that we know this is his specific work now pay attention this is Brother Bram to do at that time is because he has already accomplished the part that says he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children when the Elijah Ministry was here in John the Baptist Luke 1:17 and he shall go before him in the spirit in the power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just just uh to make ready a people prepared for the Lord that was John the Baptist in the ministry of John the hearts of the fathers were turned to the children brother Bram says this we we we know that because Jesus said so but it does not say that the hearts of the children were turned to the fathers that is yet to take place the hearts of the last day children that's you will be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers John got the fathers ready for Jesus to welcome the children into the fold now this Prophet upon whom the spirit of Elijah Falls will prepare the children to welcome back Jesus so when we talk of the Turning there there's two turnings there's fathers to the children and there's children to the fathers so the first part fathers to the children these are the fathers that were schooled in the law of Moses these were those under that Covenant that lived under the law they they were the fathers they were schooled in the law of Moses and John got the fathers ready for Jesus to welcome the children into the fold some of these accepted his message they saw the message for their day and they accepted the Messiah and he gave them the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost and they were born again you could even say they became children they were birthed this is the first turning but the second part is the children to the fathers because now we look back on those all those many years ago as the Pentecostal fathers and now a message has come to turn us back to that brother Brown says in the hearts of the children to the fathers now when this great Elijah comes in the end of the age he'll be taken the message of Pentecost I love that to turn the children to the faith of the fathers because he'll be rebuking them because they didn't keep this same faith that was back there at the beginning amen so what message turns you back to the faith the message he say is going to come and rebuke the for not keeping that Faith he says now I believe we pretty well realize it's going to be Elijah don't we now we know it brother brandham says since this Prophet messenger of revelation 10:7 will be the same as Malachi 4 he will be naturally like Elijah and John both were Men set apart from the accepted religious schools of their day both were men of the Wilderness both acted only when they had thus sayeth the Lord straight from God by Revelation both lashed out against the religious orders and leaders of their day though he will not be popular I can say that that's been fulfilled but listen he will be Vindicated by God as Jesus authenticated John and the Holy Ghost authenticated Jesus we can well expect this man will be first of all authenticated by the spirit working in his life in Acts of power that are indisputable and found nowhere else and Jesus himself in returning will authenticate him even as he authenticated John he says now this messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so what' you say all that for brother and to show you the messenger to our age is William brownon he is the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 and without his ministry we wouldn't even know definitively that there are seven Church ages think about it all the stuff we've studied how do we know that because we've recognized our day and we've recognized our message others probe at it and some have even come close but none of them had the ministry of Revelation 10:7 none of them had the ministry of Malachi 4 Luke 17 none of them had the pillar of fire none of them discerned the hearts of the people this ministry of William brandham was Vindicated and proved and therefore had the authority to proclaim the correct interpretation had the authority to proclaim the revelation of the seals and the revelation of the ages I say this message has turned our hearts back to the faith of the fathers and it has prepared us for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ this is the message to the Church of leoda and our messenger was William Mariam Bram the salutation to the age Revelation 3:14 and we're going to spend some time breaking this down it says and unto the angel the the Church of the leod Deans right these things saith the amen these these things sayith the amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of God brother Bram looks at this and he says Jesus is giving us this description of himself in relation to the last age the days of grace are winding up young people hear that the days of grace are winding up they're not over but they are winding winding up don't play around with it says he has looked from the first century right through to the 20th and told us all things concerning these ages before he reveals the characteristics of the last age to us he gives us one final look at his own gracious and supreme deity this is the Capstone revelation of him s he tells us thus saith the amen that's what he says at the beginning there these things sayith the amen thus sayith the amen Jesus is the amen of God Jesus is the so let it be of God Amen stands for finality it stands for approval it stands for prevailing promise it stands for unchanging promise it stands for the Seal of God I'm so thankful that what he says stands today you can Bank your very soul on it tonight amen and as as we read some of these things it may strike you that there's quite a bit of repetition in each age and the things that God says to the ages and it's because of the importance of certain things for instance in every age you've heard us say I Know Thy Works he says that in every age in each age there's a promise to the Overcomer in each age God says he that hath an ear and in each age God shows us his deity and I'm going to look at that for a minute and every age God shows us his deity First Age these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars and his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks second age these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is and is alive how could this be anything but deity how can this be anything but God third age these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges fourth age these things sayith the Son of God who hath eye his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass fifth age these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars sixth age these things saith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the keys of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth and in the seventh age these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God now I want to say this and this thought was just really struck me today is we've covered a lot of material through these ages and there's probably a lot of material you don't remember there's probably things you walk out of here and forget within five minutes if you retained it at all while you were here I get that but if you don't get anything out of this study and out of this book I I I want you to know beyond any shadow of a doubt out that there is one God there is one God and his name is Jesus Jesus is fully God and we should understand that the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the New Testament that's why he can show his deity as Jesus in every single age brother Brown says here oh Israel the Lord thy God is one God the New Testament does not reveal another God it is a further revelation of the one and same God Christ did not come down to make himself known he did not come down to reveal the son he came to reveal and make known the father he never talked about two Gods he talked about one God and now in this last age we have come back to the Capstone Revelation the most important revelation of godhead in the whole Bible that is Jesus Is God and he and the father are one there is one God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ he is the god of the amen he never changes he says it and it stands fast listen he is the Rock of Ages because he's not blowed this way and blowed that way what he said about you he still says it tonight he says you're going to make it you're still going to make it he said I forgiven you you're still forgiven you don't have to be wishy-washy with this God he is the god of finality he is the god of amen he is the Rock of Ages brother Bram talks about this in this sermon if you want to go listen to it in the sermon uh message of Grace 1961 and he was in the woods hunting and he had an experience and I'm I'm summarizing this and where he sees three rainbows and and he tries to get close to it and he feels to stop and he takes off his hat and he's standing a few yards from it and he he's discussing how these three Rainbows are coming up out of this hill and as he gets close he begins to realize he says I realized it was alive and realizing he's in the presence of God he says what would you have me to know he says just then the spirit of the Lord came and said Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the old he only changed his mask from Spirit to man you know some people may read these things and that may sound odd to them that may sound Mystic that may sound superstitious they're almost magical or far-fetched as they would say and but but to me I read it and it lines up perfectly with the Bible because the first age messenger Paul had that same type of experience why wouldn't the last age messenger Paul is struck down by the pillar of fire and he identifies it because he knows the Old Testament and he says who art thou Lord and he says I am Jesus and Paul gets the Revelation right there Jehovah is Jesus and Jesus is God amen that's what brother brand s he says what would you have me to know and he tells him Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new these things sayith the amen I like that it means that whatever he said is final it means that whatever he said to the first age and to the second age and to all ages about his own true church and about the false Vine is exactly right and it won't change it means that what he started out with in Genesis he will finish with in re Revelation he says now we can see again why the devil hates the Book of Genesis and Revelation he hates truth he knows the truth will prevail he knows what his end will be how he fights that but we are on the winning side can you let that sink in a little bit to you tonight you are on the winning side I mean come on somebody no matter what you're going through you're on The Winning Side tonight doesn't matter how you feel tonight doesn't matter what the devil's telling you tonight you are on The Winning Side amen so yes I'd like to tell you tonight you're going to make it you're going to do more than make it you're an overcomer you're on The Winning Side the devil says you can't the devil says you ain't you got this failure this mess up the prophet of God says you are on The Winning Side amen and for those of you in the valley tonight I'd like to remind you he hasn't forgotten you he hasn't forgotten you I love how brother Nathan dealt with those things on Sunday maybe you're in the valley tonight he has not forgotten you he cares about you tonight he's there for you tonight he he's not some impersonal God that he made you and then he died for you and then he stepped back and crossed his arms and said well let's just see how this works out let's just see how this turns out brother brother Bram deals with this and he says now I say that is how too many people are apt to think but that is wrong thinking for God is governing in the Affairs of men right now he is both Creator and sustainer what do you mean by that brother Aaron he's working on your situation right now he's dealing in your situation right now that mountain that you can't see around that Valley that you're in God is working in that situation right now he hasn't forgot about you he hasn't left you but he's working in your moment in your time the the very reason God exists why does he exist brother Brown says he exists for his own he exists for you how can he forget you you're why you're his being you're his everything you're why he's doing what he's doing he says he exists for his own and he's a faithful and true witness and you can rest in that faithfulness now that being said I'd like to add add this to that that you got to surrender your will to his will he says he's working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will you you have to trust that his will is what's best for you and yield to it when I say he's working on your behalf and he's moving on your situation and he's taking care of the situation that doesn't mean he's doing it exactly the way you want it to be worked out that doesn't mean it's all going to go perfect to how you figured it out in your head and and this is going to happen and that's going to happen but what you can do is you can trust that the way he works it out is going to work together for your good amen says he is a true witness now we talked about this last Age and and I want to bring it up again the word true here does not mean true as in contrast with false it expresses true means perfect realization in contrast to partial 1 Peter 1:8 says says whom having not seen you love you know words you had even seen Jesus but you love him and whom though now you see him not yet believe you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory and brother Bram comes in referencing this scripture it says with them we Rejoice also we haven't seen him but we have felt him we know him now as much as our limited senses can let us but one day it'll be face to face church I'm ready for that day he says that is for this age he is coming at the end of this age partial realization will be made perfect realization completed realization look we've progressed from glory to glory and we've learned and we've had Revelations and and we see him clearer than ever before but we're not talking about that we're talking about soon in this age it's going to be face to face we're going to see him face to face brother Bram says one day we will be changed in the atoms we will put on immortality we will be all swallowed up in life then we will realize realization I love the way he puts that these atoms are going to change you're going to step into eternity and you're going to see him face to face it won't be through a glass Darkly it won't just be a revelation although we thank God for it it will be a reality and you will realize realization when brother Aaron this age you're living in it it's for you not another age you're going to experience this let me challenge you tonight and tell you your struggles aren't worth missing it your sins that so easily beset you aren't worth missing it your grudges and your bitterness aren't worth missing it the the the family cycles and Daddy's problems and Grandmama's problems those things ain't worth missing it this is the time this is the time to lay those things down and run this is the time to to lay those things aside the sin that would beset you and run with all your might forget your ideas and forget your thoughts and run tonight because when are we going to see him face to face that is for this age he says he's faithful and true he says he's faithful and true witness Creator and sustainer perfect realization the amen of God it goes on to say that he is the beginning of the creation of God brother Brown says that is who the Lord Jesus says he is we're going to begin to wind this down he says' but those words don't mean exactly as they sound to us he says just taking them the way they sound has made some people in fact multitudes of people get the idea that Jesus was the first creation of God making him lower than godhead then this first creation Jesus created all the rest of the universe and whatsoever it contains but that is not right because that doesn't line up with the rest of the Bible you can't make that line up and it all has to line up brother Brown says now we know for assurity that Jesus is God very God he is the creator John 1 and3 says all things were made by him Jesus and without him was not anything made that was made so what does it mean when it says that he's the beginning of the creation of God brother brand tells us the words are that he is the beginner or the author of the creation of God I want to show us what he's talking about here so so we see him standing there in the midst of his church revealing who he is in the last age and he says I'm the author of the creation of God now brother Brandon makes it very clear in this moment in this last age when he's speaking he's not talking about the creation at the beginning listen he says this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of the church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride so what what are we talking about here the be the beginning of the creation of God the the author of the creation of God remember Jesus was virgin born he was a God man man and God met and joined and so he was the first one of a new race that's what I talking about here he was the very first one of a new race brother Bram says 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creation old things have passed away behold all things are become new there you can see that though man was of the old creation Now in Union with Christ he has become the new creation of God Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship created in Union with Christ Jesus unto good works Ephesians 4:24 and that ye put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh that was how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue issue Through The Godly Isaac line but now out of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself so think about it when you receive the new birth you are born again into a new creation old things passed away all things have now become new this is the new creation being spoken of here when he talks about the beginning of the creation of God Jesus is the firstborn among many Brethren the beginning of the creation of God the beginning of the church the beginning of the Bride he is the firstborn he says this was his purpose this purpose took form through election that is why he could look right down to the last age when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as author of this new creation of God his Sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will by his omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to pass what are you doing here how are you still standing why are you accepting the message by his decree he predestinated he elected you and he is bringing it to pass my if you could let that Revelation strike your soul tonight what power could come against you no power can make you doubt no power can make you fall no power can stop you it's him it's his will that you're here it's his will that you're going to make it it's his decree that you're going to Rapture the very reason you're here still standing it's his Sovereign will he decreed you would be here and here you are he decreed there would be a church and here you are he decreed there would be a Rapture and there will be a Rapture and you'll be there he has decreed it and his decree cannot be stopped amen the last section we'll get to tonight the message to the leoan church I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou work cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness knew not of here anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see as many as I love and rebuke as me as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent in the beginning there well in the entire thing but what you find in there if you break it down is there's two indictments against the church first they're neither cold nor hot they're lukewarm we dealt with this at the very beginning it's the spirit of the age it's what's trying to overtake you it's what makes you sit there lifeless in church it's what makes it hard to read your Bible it's what makes it hard for you to pray it's what makes you go to the movies instead of to the message it's lukewarmness so it's what it is once again I want to make it very clear because sometimes kids get it twisted I remember sitting in your seat um this message ain't about everything we're against it's about what we're for and we're for you overcoming and we're for you rapturing we're not here to say don't have fun we're not here to say you should never have entertainment that's not what this is about but you know you're lukewarm when that's all your life consists of that's all we're saying make it very clear search Your Own Heart Lord has those things taken the place of my desire for you do I find it almost impossible to pray impossible to read my Bible just because it's not that I'm a against God it's not that I'm against those things it's that the hunger for those things isn't there or it's lacking or it's been covered over by things of the world that leads to lukewarm and because of that they will be spewed out the other indictment they say they are rich and have need of nothing and do not recognize their need of God for the sake of time we're just going to deal with lukewarm we'll pick up the other part later he says we're going to look at this carefully it says that this leoan church age group is lukewarm this lukewarmness Demands a penalty from God the penalty is that they will be spewed out of his mouth now I want you to understand in this context it's not spoken to an individual it's spoken uh to the church he's talking to the church Collective remember there's always been two Vines two churches true and false and he's speaking to the church here and a lot of people think this is well God's going to spew me out and and and I guess I guess you could look at it this way but as individuals the word shows us in many places it shows us engraved on the palms of his hands it shows us carried in his bosom it says that we were in his mind it says we're in his Sheepfold but never does it speak of you as individuals as being in his mouth okay so what is in his mouth we covered this in another age matter of fact one of the ages showing his deity talked about the two-edged sword that is in his mouth so so the word or the sharp two-edged sword is in his mouth and and the word is in his mouth and as his body on Earth the word is supposed to be in our mouth as well 1 Peter 4:11 says if any man speak let him speak as the Oracle or the word of God so brother Brown says what is wrong with these people of the last day why are they being spewed out they have gotten away from the word they are no longer fervent about it now just stop for a minute and let's all be honest with ourselves and ask yourself does this describe me they are no longer fervent about it that's on fire touched by fire let the world come and watch me burn they are lukewarm about it that describes leoda that describes the group spewed out of his mouth God is sickened by their lack of honor to the word they've strayed from the word and they replaced it with their own ideas and their own Creeds and it has made him sick and he says here I'm spewing you out like vomit in other words the church will no longer speak for me they are no longer my mouthpiece because the word is not in their mouth she's no longer going to represent me if you look at Romans 10:8 it says but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach so yes as individuals we are to have his word in our heart and in our mouth because he wants us to be used as his voice he wants us to represent him but but he wants us to elevate his word Above All Else he wants it elevated above our ideas and he wants to elevated above our fears and our complexes and and you get to this place where he spews the church out and and they're no longer his voice but he has called out a people he has called out a bride and he has placed his voice in Her who is this her that's you and he expects you to elevate his word and for this word to be what's in your mouth for his word to be what you honor for his word to be what is lifted up he calls a bride out and he separates from the church he says this church can't speak for me anymore she's lukewarm she doesn't honor my word she looks to her Creeds and her dogmas so I'm calling out another group I'm calling out somebody else that will speak for me a bride who has received the voice of a prophet and then under her messenger she is to be the final voice to the final age you are supposed to be a voice to the world how can you be if you blend in with the world how can you be if you're saying what the world says it's the law of contrast come and watch me burn you are to be a light burning in the darkness you can't be lukewarm about this word you can't lay it aside just says well I like it and it's church and yeah I believe but are you fervent for the word is there a passion for the word we can't be lukewarm about it he says we're a part of it if you're a part of the Bride you are because the bride is part of the groom you know so we find out that it's the same thing she'll do just exactly what's predicted for her to do in this day she won't be a leoa not by no means a lukewarm but she'll be on fire for God she'll be moving on in the spirit of God brother brandham says a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with the word and the Lutheran spoke for God at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost to organization it tends towards dogma and Creeds and not simple word they could no longer speak for God then God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his Revelation from God became the living Epistles read and known of all men for their generation when the Methodist failed God raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age that's us there's no other age to come we can't be lukewarm about it you are his voice well brother Aon what are we supposed to speak the word the word is not thee even in thy mouth all of the word is not not just arguing over it and dividing it and taking what you want and leaving Parts you don't like we don't have the word so we can debate it we don't have the word so we can figure out am I allowed to do this or am I allowed to do that we have the word so it so it can be manifest Ed you are to be the living breathing manifested word of God and I say tonight let it live through you let it conquer through you let it overcome through you I can't overcome this thing I know let the word overcome it in your life well I can't figure this just lay it aside and let the word manifest let the word conquer your situations you are to be a living voice in this last day listen lukewarmness is all around us and I don't just mean out there lukewarmness is all around us every single day you fight it every single day it creeps in it takes over and as we close this tonight I just want to say in the closing moments of the final age we have to shake ourselves all of us do we can't we can't just rest on our Laurels and well I've made it you have to shake yourself every single day sir I don't want to identify with the lukewarm church I don't want want to identify with the leot thean age I want to be part of that group that is speaking for him on fire for him moving on with the spirit he says she'll be on fire for God she'll be moving on in the spirit of God let that be what the the the way evening light Tabernacle is described let that describe your life let that describe our youth group we're on fire for God the whole world may be lukewarm it may be going down but as for me and my house I'm going to be on fire I'm going to have a hunger I'm going to move in the spirit when the spirit moves I am not a lead of sin I'm not going down with Le oia but I've been called out of the age into the bride age because it's bride time what's that mean it's a time where a bride's called out prepared for a Rapture that's who you are but you got to step into it give it your all say I won't be lukewarm I won't give in to the to the spirit of the age because it's coming for you it's all around you and just cuz you get the Holy Ghost don't mean it ain't still coming for you you'll find yourself in lukewarm States and lukewarm days a lukewarm service not that the service is lukewarm you're having a lukewarm service you've got to fight every single day to stay on fire have that passion burning on the inside of you because this bride will by no means be a Le of of sin I can say tonight that I'm thankful I'm thankful we've recognized our day I'm thankful we've recognized our message I'm thankful we know who William brandham was that's great but as I close I ask you this what are you going to do with it what are you going to do with it will you bow your heads with me just
