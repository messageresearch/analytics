christofield's there in south africa and his wife was suffering with cancer in the third i think third stage of rectal cancer and then she he also had been without a job for a couple of years needed deliverance and in that very service we prayed over that prayer request and that prayer cloth sent it to south africa and little sister was healed totally healed of the cancer the brother got a job a great job that he was able to have a sustainable wage for his family god is a neat supplier he's a faithful god sister karen i just left her a few moments ago in the hospital and she said to tell you thank you for praying for her she knows you're doing it amen so god bless you as she recovers and we believe we lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen we just heard the word confirmed again that david went down to ziglag and found it burnt and he inquired of the lord and he said pursue it you're going to recover all amen he got his wife back he got his uh the spoils back and even those

jehovah god who heals all diseases or she's been in the hospital but doctors can't heal lord medicine can't do the healing so if healing is going to be done god's going to do it even if he uses maybe the instrumentality of man is still god that heals father we're asking in the name of jesus the miraculous power of god will go forth as we lay our hands lord take from our body this cloth and send it across disease to this need we rebuke that cancer we command commanded to leave this daughter of god satan you i adjure you in the name of the lord you leave god's people alone we break your power and

pray together father how great thou art lord you truly are a great god a great god for our needs lord today we're so thankful father we can call upon you in our time of trouble you are a hiding place a place a strong tower we can run into and the righteous are saved lord god we come to you today father just knowing that you're here among us confidence in our hearts lord to realize lord you're not some million miles away but lord your hears your word declares it to be so in the midst of us father what a confidence that gives us what a authority that gives us lord to realize we know we're not in this valley he said you'll never leave us or forsake us god we just commit this service in your hands lord everything to be said and done for your glory we love you lord and we praise you in jesus name amen amen amen that was some wonderful worship giving god glory amen you know it's easy to worship him on the mountains but it's when you're in the valley that's where true worship comes amen you know today we we have this whatsapp you know with the musicians and songs started coming in specials and you just tell people it was had a heart for worship and and you know the thought came to me about you know their jehoshaphat you know the word spoken said just get you some worshippers and start worshiping me and while you're worshiping me i'll fight your battles and so i went to open up my my bible app to actually take a little bit out of there and post it in there and and on the front there the scripture of the day was psalms 32 verse 7. it says thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance salah say law means to pause and calmly think about that amen i'd like to think about that for a moment because he has the answer for every situation that we're in we'll let you be seated for a moment amen is not something i normally do but i usually like to try to get right into the word because i'm not much of a talker as far as in front of people but amen but i love to i love to have the anointing to preach amen because under the anointing all the where the weird feelings and funny feelings leave but you know i just wanted to take a moment and and just tell you about the last couple of weeks because we've been away from home and and we took a little trip there uh to to do some ministering and and also as a moment to celebrate me and sister ruth's 25th anniversary it's hard to believe that we've come to that milestone but here we are and we're very thankful that god has brought us to this place and we're looking for many more years to come however long time will tear it but you know we had a wonderful trip it was a supernatural trip we had a weekend of meetings at brother ron's and then a weekend y'all can be seated we're we had a weekend of meetings ministering there afterwards for brother josh bennett with brother wayne lawson and in between was able to take a couple of days and celebrate our anniversary but i didn't go just to go i went commissioned and fought through obstacles demonic attacks mind battles spirits of oppression attacks against my own family even against my own mother you know the day that we would actually get on the plane to leave she was being checked into the hospital and it was telling us that she would have a she was found that she had some type of growth or mass in her heart and so i didn't know if she would be going into surgery i didn't know what was about to happen but you know i just had really felt impressed to continue on in in in the direction that i felt god had directed me to be in and so uh you know i i came to the continued as we pressed on through all of that and i'll tell you it's not an easy place to be because the the devil yeah the devil likes to come and he likes to torment you in your mind you know you get on a plane and you don't have text and you don't have messaging for some time so he likes to come and torment you but we found that she would go there and they would find that there was no mass there was nothing there and so we thank the lord for that and so we but you know as we would meet up with the spencer family on friday and you know the spencer and prut family has been very close through the years we've been brought together through the fire of adversity and you know i went there to try to encourage because i knew it was right out of the year that he had he had felt directed to come here amen to be prayed for and and so you know i thought it was it's quite interesting that here we are at a year and my mother is back in the hospital again with the same condition or another attack of the enemy and you know but i i i want to say that i appreciate you as a congregation that have been standing in faith with us and and sending all the text and and the encouragement and you know and also creating an atmosphere that healings can take place and deliverances can take place in the house of god you know but i'd like to share just a few things from from brother tim as he would write down when he would go to brother ron's at the beginning of his diagnosis and uh he would be there to meet him on kind of a surprise trip because brother ron had had just found out you know what was going on in his body and you know all the things that were taking place and and you know brother tim would write that it was a very emotional time as they would meet there in the airport brother ron would sob and weep on his shoulder he said it was like we were alone a hundred people walking by we were oblivious to anyone around he had prayed that morning saying god i need a boost we went from there to his home to where brother donnie and sister carol reagan was waiting inside brother ron was not to was not going to wait for another day to pray he wanted prayer right then he was unlike pharaoh who wanted one more night with the frogs so brother don and i began talking of divine healing and deliverances and how god has delivered others who were dying by the gary stanky brother ron himself when he was dying from the burns and that it was the will of god to be healed and the ladies were in the joining room and they came in as we were about to pray and the holy spirit fell down among us and anointed us we prayed and cursed that demon of cancer and for his immune system to be activated to seek and destroy that cancer for the dawn he began to intercede in the spirit as tongues from the heavenly language have been to begin to flow from his mouth we were charged by the holy ghost and demanded that evil spirit of cancer to leave his body it was a powerful and anointing moment brother tim would go and he'd preach that on saturday night on who hath believed our report and sunday night on our redemptive rights and you know at that time was also me and brother tim or the george winters brother ron was actually had tickets to go to japan and to minister in japan and then from japan over to the philippines to minister there and and um cove had started hitting you know that all the things had taken place brother ron's diagnosis and so uh we had to you know put that aside for the moment but while he's ministering there's a lady that had been in a in a school and she'd been witness into this japanese professor and she he'd had a lot of questions you know how can god do the things that he's that the bible says he's done when it's it's uh you know scientifically impossible for it to happen you know it has to be you know he's taking her to tell her it had to be scientifically proved and so she began to talk about different things and and talked about knowing the art regardless of scientific proof it rained and you know examples of joshua and the sun standing still and so she just told him to check out a youtube link and and you know if he was interested brother tim would be ministering at this church so he decided to check it out and he began to hear the same things be repeated back to him as brother tim would comment about joshua and the son standing still and he shared that he was so overwhelmed by a presence that fell in his room he immediately gave his heart to the lord and he said and he was thankful that the lord understood him as he had never prayed and he asked me he asked the sister what shall i do next and he said she said be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and and god has done some wonderful things right there and you know even as we were supposed to be ministering or felt like we to go to japan amen even though that didn't work out in that way it was a different way than we expected god still was saving some japanese people amen it's amazing and then you know as we would have to cancel the flights and all the things that delta said well you just have to wait a year you got a year to use it and i would call and they'd say well you got to do this and you got to do that and there's really no way we can just refund your money and all this and one morning i woke up and i felt impressed to call them and i called him got this lady on the phone and i began to talk to her and tell her what had taken place and i told her that our one of our friends brother ron that was traveling with us had had been diagnosed with cancer and she said oh my god she said i'm a cancer survivor i'll get you your money back and in just a few moments all of that twelve thousand dollars worth of tickets were being refunded just like that and he meant god intervening on our behalf but brother tim would write this he said since hearing the news on brother ron i've been praying earnestly for a visitation from the lord via dream or a vision or his voice or any way he wanted i felt like i was like joshua looking at walls of jericho trying to find a way to get through the big walls in order to conquer the enemy but on sunday night i had a very vivid dream i saw young but mature buzzards that had left the nest but had not learned to fly they were about 12 and i was feeding them to pigs monday i had a day of fellowship and preached all day to brother ron about the promises of healing on tuesday morning we were going to with him to the hospital to find the news of treatment and plans and then we were to fly out and for home at 2 40 in the afternoon in the middle of night i had an experience of waking up that i thought that i heard and was singing the song we shall see miracles when i got up for the coffee i was greeted by sister connie and i poured the water as i poured the water into the coffee pot she asked how our night was and i said find fine it was fine and if any if it's any consolation to you i woke up during the night singing the songs we shall see miracles she began crying and said brother tim brother ron couldn't sleep and i woke up at 2 30 and was singing the song we shall see miracles and i have to say we have saw miracles just here this last easter we saw a man that was supposed to been dead a long time ago minister under the power of the holy ghost and if you hadn't been watching his services amen you wouldn't think that a man would have lung cancer and brain cancer he end up whining and carrying on about how bad his day is he's up firing cannons amen and it's very encouraging if you need brother brother brother ben davis i saw him this past weekend and he said you know if there's ever a day i'm down in the dumps i go turn on one of his sermons and by the time that's in that sermon i'm walking out of there with my head up high thinking i got nothing to complain about amen so but on the way to the doctor they would to discuss this cancer and plans uh brother brother tim would remember his dream and it came to me that brother branham told that the buzzards represented cancers in disease and affliction the cancer in the spiritual he's a devil he's the type of a scavenger in a buzzard and eats dead things but i was puzzled by what pigs meant i scanned through over 150 quotes on pigs and couldn't find a clue in the sermon but when the doctor was talking about treatment using immunotherapy i did an internet search on cancer and this immunotherapy and pigs and found that they developed it using small pig just like i saw in the dream there were about 12 of them as i fed them to the pigs one by one i could see them chewing them up ripping apart the guts of the buzzards it would be last year as we said brother ron would feel to come to louisiana to be prayed for i spoke to him on the phone that week prior to his coming and he'd say now you watch satan's going to try to block it in just a few days my mom sister karen would have her third brain bleed it would be where she would need surgery doctors gave us no hope and we felt but we felt for brother ron to come anyways and god met us in a cabin and three boys my two sons and brother adam would have an experience with god brother ron would receive supernatural strength from that moment he never missed another day of work before that he didn't have the strength harder to get out and walk out of his bedroom but after that moment every day since that time a year later he's not missed a day of work he goes to work with his boys and things and and so and so but now a year later satan has tried to block a visitation again my mom you know has begun again being attacked by confusion and memory loss and now even a fourth brain bleed but our god is awesome amen our god is awesome you know as i would talk with brother tim about this the trip that i was to go on and you know we felt that we had come to a spot like the red sea will we back up from the promises of god or will we speak and go forward and so we spoke and we went forward and we walked by faith and not by sight you know as i would land there in virginia brother tim would call me and he talked to me and said son we've been together in many things we've begun we've been together in the church the ministry you've helped me on the farm you know we had goats you helped me sell them when the time has come when we had cows you helped me find buyers and sold them for me he said now i'm commissioning to go sell some pigs the last buzzards have been fed it's time to sell the pigs we don't need them anymore and i'm here to testify we went and sold pigs amen i believe god's a healer i believe god has come on the scene for our brother and i believe that he's going to go into full health that's what i believe i know you can anybody can question what they want to question but i saw god man manifest among us and i believe he's going to do what he said he's going to do amen and so that's where i've been so we would go from there we'd go to uh brother josh bennett's and we'd have some wonderful services there to where the presence of god would just come down in our midst and i believe he's the same god tonight amen let's stand together as we read our scripture hebrews 13 and verse 8 and also first kings 18 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever also first kings 18 and verse 36 and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things as thy word hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou has turned their heart back again then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god is that your testimony tonight god is god amen we let you be seated you know before i left the wednesday night before i spoke on the god that answers tonight i would like to speak to you tonight we have the answer we have the answer you know as we would look at that thought on the god that answers we would find here that elijah would bring these people before as a showdown to mount carmel and he would bring them because there was some that was serving many that was serving baal and a god that was not alive of course and a dead god but they would they would you know know the story of how he would set up the all they would he'd tell them to do the set up the altar put the sacrifice there and said let the god who answers by fire let him be god amen the goddess answers and and but you know what his challenge would have been no good if god wouldn't have answered but god answered and god came on the scene as as we've seen this as as he would come and he would set it all together and put it all back in place and put all the loose ends together and bring back the the altar to his position and his place and and then ask god to move and and god moved on his behalf see god always answers he always answers jesus would say ask and you shall receive seek and you shall find anyone that asks will receive anyone that seeks shall find anyone that knocks it will be open unto him that's the only way that i found if i get was to get anything from god is to take him at his word and believe it no matter which way he sends it god will answer amen god sometimes will meet you in an unexpected way in an unexpected time in an unexpected place as we as we talked about how he did with moses moses it was an unexpected moment for moses he was out there on the backside of a desert he was out there minding his own business tented some sheep and all of a sudden he noticed a bush that was on fire and it was not burned and he said i'm going to go see what god what is happening here and so he'd walk to this place and a voice would speak out of that bush and would call him by name and he would recognize it this is god god is ministering unto me god is speaking unto me and brother branham would say that he said he met him at an unexpected age and an unexpected place and an unexpected way god didn't meet moses the way he usually meets men but he met him in an unusual way that's the way sometimes he answers our prayer in the way that he thinks is best in the way in his way is always right and if we just ask anything and it doesn't happen don't let that make you lose or lose faith or fall back but let's ask god and stand firm on his word and say it's true no matter how dark it is no matter how troublesome it looks no matter how possible it be god's word is true amen now the word now the answer may come in a disguised manner in a way that you know in other words in a way that you're not expecting or a way that in a way that's so different from what you was thinking it would come but god will answer you god will come on the scene god will answer his word god will fulfill his word you know that's how god answers the promises he answers them by fulfilling them amen he brings the answer by fulfilling the question amen as he would with jesus jesus was the fulfillment jesus was the answer to behold a virgin shall conceive jesus was the answer to all the things that was laying in there the bible that many people were looking to come in a different way in a different manner and a different time but god answered it anyhow and it went beyond all the critics and it went beyond all everyone that thought they had it figured out all the high priests that thought they had to figure it out every person that thought they had it all lined out amen and when he come they didn't recognize it see brother branham would say as long as you recognize it to be god when he answers you and that's the most important thing that when you can recognize this is god moving this is god answering you know he said you know many times he would say in another place he said if there was ever an hour that the church of the living god needs a joshua and caleb it is right now amen that would look at the word of god and say we have the answer we have the answer for this situation that we are more than conquerors amen we have the answer for our promised land god's already gave it to us he said so then all the little frantics and all the running this has got that and this is god stand still a minute god's got it amen god's got it the bible is the answer to every problem that's ever come up oh hallelujah his word is the answer to every problem that comes up it's in another place god has the answer that's what we want to talk about to have the answer god has got the answer he is the answer christ is the answer to every problem we've got amen so christ and so therefore if christ is the answer we have the answer because god has released it to us his people in this generation christ has come down in the pillar of fire as he did on moses brother brother wayne i'm actually borrowing the title from him because on saturday night i preached on amen the god who answers on sunday morning he got up and said we have the answer amen because if you would look in malachi 4 he would say you know i send you elijah the prophet but thank moses and he came down on a mountain amen and he met moses on a mountain to fulfill the to bring the law to bring the promises of god to the people amen and this is exactly what happened in our generation he met a prophet and he gave him the word of god he gave him the answer for laodicea he gave him the answer for every disease he gave him the answer for cancer and sugar diabetes and every situation that we could ever go through he gave him the answer for every spirit of hell amen this word that we have received is the answer for hell itself hell comes with questions we got the answer hell comes with his problems we got the answer hell comes with his situations and all the things around us and his storms and his waves and his ways we have the answer we have christ that's among us amen we have the answer to every circumstance we have the answer to every devil's question jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever as i would leave on this trip and i was looking for an answer i was looking for god to move in a situation in our situation at home in brother ron's situation and i'm just i was just asking god i need this i need to see you and sister ruth was praying lord let him see you let him see you move in a supernatural way and and we would minister on on for on saturday night brother ron's on the final voice that god's a final word he's the answer amen and so as we administered here before and and you know and the next morning we'd get up and go to church and we'd minister on on the god that answers and we was you know it was very interesting that same weekend brother michael and sister bethany had scheduled to be there as well and without even knowing we would be there and we didn't know they was going to be there and not that that was a problem we just happened to be there together but you know we was there and they had asked brother michael to sing that morning and he gets up that morning and he starts mentioning a song the great physician now is near he said i love that song he said because that's the song that the the piano continued to play when that little girl a man would begin to raise her hand she you know she had saw something take place she saw the answer take home you know it was a little boy that was crippled with polio and and couldn't walk and brother branham was holding him in his arms he begins to pray for him he tells it many times and and he talks about how that he thought that the custodian had turned on a light and brought was blinding him in his eyes and and he thought that was kind of rude you know to do that in that moment but he did he said i began to realize it wasn't that it was the pillar of fire and he said i don't know if i dropped the boy or if he jumped out of my arms all i know is he was out of my arms as i was praying he come out of my arms his feet came straight he went running across the platform well that little girl sitting over there was like she was brother brandon would call her a dunkard which is basically an amish or a mennonite another little form of them and and she didn't know of course about the power of god she was just there maybe helping out in the service and she was playing that song the great physician now is near the sympathizing jesus and when that little boy come out of that little brother branham's arms and began to run her hands went up and she began to dance she began to praise the lord for what she had saw she saw the answer she saw god come and answer the question amen and the song and then the piano amen began he said it didn't just play one more note it played another whole the whole rest of the song just continued to play amen god apparently the angel of god knows how to play the piano amen and and so she began to speak in tongues and the piano never missed a note playing the great physician now is here the sympathizing jesus he speaks to the drooping hearts to cheer no other name but jesus and he said when that happened people began to flock down to the altar screaming god have mercy on me because they all they also witnessed the power of god to answer the question in a little boy's life amen and they saw god move in a supernatural way in a supernatural realm and so you know i'm i'm also asking god to do something to move and and and because i'm walking you know by faith and i'm but you still want to see god you still want to see him visible among you you still want to see him and i you know i was like lord whatever it is just like brother tim if it be a vision if it'd be a dream whatever however i want you to come and i'm speaking on this subject on god coming at an unexpected time at an unexpected place in an unexpected way but god always answers and i said god has the answer for cancer he has the answer for a brain bleed he has an answer for every sickness he has the answer for every struggle he has an answer for every question is it all right if i preach what a preacher amen he's got the answer for it all he is the answer for it all his word is the answer for it all you say well is it god's will to be healed there's an answer for that by my stripes you're healed [Applause] amen and so i'm telling that and i begin to speak about how the i mean the the angel of god the angels began to come to god amen gabriel and wormwood and began to talk about the three who were children who was about to step on the fire and i'm i'm bringing it out as brother branham would speak about that and how gabriel came with the sword drawn and he's like lord have you seen what's going on down there amen your children are standing for you they're they're holding they're holding the line they're not backing up they're not bowing but they're about to go in the fire have you been watching them father and he said yeah i've been watching them amen i'm thankful to have a god who's watching amen and wormwood comes up and he he says you know i'm the angel of the flood i'll i'll drown i'll drown out the fire i'll put it out just send me down there and i'm speaking all of that brother ron you know how has a little white round platform that goes out in front of his pulpit like that and i've stepped down there for some time and i'm bringing it all out like this and i'm talking about it and i said but god told those angels he said this is not a job for you this is a job for me he said you've been good angels but i'm going to go down there and i'm going to step in the fire oh hallelujah and as i'm speaking about how he took his robes off and he laid him on the throne and he grabbed the east and he grabbed the west wind and he grabbed a zig zag of lightning and as they took that step into the fire there was the fourth man he was the answer for the fire hallelujah amen and as i'm speaking of that i'm going to say could you imagine and i was going to finish it and say the king that was sitting there and he sees this take place he put three in there but now there's four men in there my ipad sitting behind me on the pulpit beginning to play a sermon as you can probably go back and watch it i was caught it was an unexpected time in an unexpected place in an unexpected way hallelujah apparently an angel knows how to use an ipad brother ron sitting behind me over there said he saw it light up he saw it change over to the app so it picked the sermon and pushed play i don't listen to sermons on my ipad i listened to him on my phone with my earbuds but so i i didn't even have it pulled up it picked out a sermon in 56 the worst center in the city and it goes like this and it begins to speak my favorite hymn as i'm talking about him coming down the fire my favorite hymn the background of it you would only know how to come out my friend brother booth clibbon wrote it that on his knees by inspiration in a cornfield one night with pasteboard pieces in the bottom of his shoes for soles on his shoes sold it to wycliffe for a hundred dollars and he'd taken the copyright of the song he said but that's my favorite hymn now i'm looking i've been walking back around and i'm looking like thinking what's going on you know i'm trying to figure out what's happened to my ipad and i hear the prophet's voice speaking so i thought well this wasn't me so i'm just going to let it play and it says because it expresses the extreme deity of the lord jesus especially in a day like this when they try to make him just a prophet but he was more than a prophet he was god [Applause] at that moment i thought it was i just listened to a tape brother brown i'm talking about only believe but i believe that was paul raider that wrote that song at that moment i was thinking the only believer i got back to the office and i thought that ain't right and i looked up this man and he was speaking about down from his glory every living story my god and savior came and jesus is his name born in a manger to his own a stranger a man of sorrows tears in agony oh how i love him oh how i adore him my breath my sunshine my all in all the great creator became my savior hallelujah he became my answer when i was walking through the darkness and didn't know what was about to happen i found my answer jesus is the answer and he's not a thousand miles or a million miles off he has come down [Applause] what condensation bringing us redemption that in the dead of night not one faint hope inside but god gracious tender laid aside his splendor stoop in the woo to win to save my soul without reluctance flesh and blood and substance he took the form of man and revealed the hidden plan all glorious mystery sacrifice of calvary and now i know and now i know thou art the great i am oh how i love him oh how i adore him my breath my sunshine my all in all is there somebody here that can say yes he's the answer for my problems he's the answer for my situation he's the answer oh how i love him i love him when he comes on the scene and he changes it in a moment in a twinkling of an eye he is the answer and we have the answer it's god among his people walking among his people healing the raising the dead setting the captor free he is god he would play all the way till in the scripture he'd finish in the scripture lesson tonight in saint luke 7 and the 36th verse he said when you go home finish reading that chapter well i did what he said in that chapter in luke chapter 7 would be a man who needed a a healing for a servant be a centurion who had been good to the jews and even built them a place of worship and and and he had but you know he had a he had a need but he said lord he said he said hey i'm not even worthy that you even come to my house but you speak the word and my servant will be healed what happened he recognized jesus is the answer that he can speak the word because he said i'm a man of authority when i say this one to go they go when i say stay they stay when i say come they come he said when i say do this they do it and jesus would look at him and marvel and say i've not found so great faith no not in israel but when they went and returned to the house they found the servant whole that had been sick he was the answer to the sickness and then he would go from there and he would go down into the city and at the gate there was a dead man being carried out the only son of a mother it was a widow and there was much people the city with her and the lord saw her and had compassion on her and said we've not that's right because you've got the answer right here we've not and he said to the young man young man i say unto thee arise and he that was dead set up and began to speak hallelujah he delivered him to his mother this is all in that same chapter luke chapter 7 and they would begin to you know talk about john the baptist but we're going to go on down to where he was reading from because his sermon was in 56 called the worst center in the city you know i try to put this all together what's the chances of it even pulling up a tape and playing on its own i've never had that anybody ever had that happen before i ain't never had that happen before brother wayne would tell me a testimony he actually i believe told it i've heard him tell it maybe it was on online somewhere of him being in a motel room and there was a question in his heart and all of a sudden his tape player his computer began to play i believe it was his computer wasn't plugged in didn't have a battery begin to play and it answered the very question that was in his heart so he's that kind of god he's the answer you might got questions tonight but if you're looking out in the world for your answer that ain't the place to find the answer there's that only going to bring more confusion and more misunderstanding amen you know we have the answer amen amen it was like i was telling them this weekend at those meetings you know i'm not looking for somebody else's approval on this message it's got god's approval on it that's all that matters so therefore i could care less what anybody else has to say about it any critic has to say about it anybody wants to build a website has to say about it i could care less what they got to say god said amen and he answered it but he was reading i don't know if i can i'm still so moved by these things he said one in verse 36 of luke chapter 7 one of the pharisees desired that he would eat with him and he went to the pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus said at meat in the pharisees house brought a alabaster box of ointment and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and he'd wiped them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with ointment now when the pharisee which had bitten him saw it she spoke he spoke within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who in what manner a woman this is that touches him for she is a sinner but what was the deal the woman saw him and knew he was the answer for her need the pharisees apparently didn't realize he's the answer he's the answer for our struggles he's an answer for what is going on around us he's an answer for all the confusion that's around us he's the answer but the prophet god said they left him and the bible says they left him in the corner with dirty feet because they didn't recognize who's among us and as i'm speaking about him coming down this verse is coming out he has come down but you got to recognize he's here you got to recognize he's in our services you got to recognize he is humongous you got to recognize who's moving and who's changing lives and who's touching lives and when you recognize it you'll worship him [Applause] when you recognize him you'll bring your best you'll give everything you got you'll lay aside everything around you and say i want to bring my best and lay it at the king of kings and the king lord of lords feet and wash his feet and thank him for taking all the sin away from me and thank him for healing my mama and thank him for doing all the things he's doing he is ashamed yesterday today and forever and if he is the same he deserves the same praise he deserves the same worship he deserves the same honor bring your best brother i will say it go listen to that tape if you can make it through i'm just going to tell you better get you a box of tissues brother brother david cross would call me the next day or so he said you know you mentioned that he said i had to travel to work today an hour or so so i felt i said i'm gonna listen to that he said brother timothy he said do not believe just how closely that service and that saturday night service matched he said the atmosphere how it all took place he said i think the issue with people is they want to be in them services not realizing we're having them services [Applause] listen we're in an interesting time right now people are traveling once again all over the country to go to a service traveling like mad just like they did 50 60 years ago meetings are packed out people are under expectation young people they've seen it they've seen god operate they've seen him moving they've seen him to be the same they want to be in those services [Applause] yeah hallelujah amen you know i i believe we're in a we're in a real time right now amen i believe that the same if you when the expectation starts getting that way in the people and they begin to realize god's the same today as he was yesterday if he opened the blinded isaiah and he's going to open it now if he'll the triple boy then he's going to do it now [Applause] if he played a piano then that he can he can play an ipad now he's ashamed yesterday today and forever he is the answer in every service he is answering your home he's answering your job he's the answer wherever you are christ is the answer but don't think when you worship him the devil's voice ain't going to be there simon begin to have these thoughts but i love this as she began to worship him and she began to give him praise and she began to honor him when nobody else would honor him when nobody else was you know nobody else was jumping and shouting nobody else was getting carried away she didn't care i'm here to worship him because he's my answer he can answer all my life struggle i can see he has the answer she had sins she needs forgiveness and she knew he had to answer for those sins so while she's worshiping the devil starts talking but she didn't have to answer the devil he answered the devil [Applause] hallelujah i want you to understand if you'll worship him and you'll glorify him and you'll bring your best while you're worshiping him god will answer the devil on your behalf he'll tell that devil where to go he'll tell him to back off he'll be as an angel as he stood there with a flaming sword amen the captain of the lord's house and jesus answered him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee and he said master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors one owed 500 pence and another 50 when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which someone which of them would love him most jesus answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave most amen and he said unto him thou hast rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto the simon see us thou this woman i entered into thy house that gave me no water from my feet but she's washed my feet with her tears wiped them with the hairs of her head that gave us me no kiss but this woman since the time i come in has not ceased to kiss my feet my head with all that i did is not anoint but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she has for she loved much but to whom little was forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven hallelujah there was her answer thy sins are forgiven and they'd have sat and meet with him begin to say with himself who is this that forgive us sins also and he said to the woman thy faith has saved thee go in peace there's our answer for the situation that we're in tonight our faith has saved us we're going to walk in peace we're going to walk in peace because god's got it all in control he's moving when i don't even see him moving he's making a way when i can't see away he's doing it anyhow therefore i'm going to go in peace because my faith in the same word that raised lazarus is the same one today and i'm going to walk in that piece hallelujah what has happened is shown beyond a shadow of a doubt he has come down he has taken this moment personally when he takes something personal he comes down look at look at joshua the walls of jericho he turned around there was an angel standing there with a sword drawn he took it personal this is my people's land this is their inheritance joshua you're not going to fight this battle alone but i'm with you as i was with moses so i shall be with thee be of good cheer be courageous don't be afraid amen walk into the battle because you're going to walk out victorious have i not commanded you be strong and courageous do not be terrified do not be discouraged for the lord your god will be with you wherever you go he showed i've taken this personal he has shown me he's taken this battle personal because he came behind and he said now they want to say i'm just a prophet but i'm more than a prophet i'm god he assured me he's got control of this situation amen he's got control of the cancer he got control of the brain plea and we have the answer you say you have the answer yes i have the answer it's in psalms 103 i'm the lord god that heals all thy diseases we have the answer [Applause] amen amen brother branham we'll talk about this in the mystery of god christ is a mystery i'm talking about the headship of christ has come down being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question we have the answer to the devil's question he christ has risen and he's paid the price and he's raising up the body to meet the head oh hallelujah the devil can't stand it that's the reason all these other kingdoms are setting up economical kings the reason they're all coming in to what they're doing now the devil that's the reason he's howling the way he is his wickedness of schemes has been uncovered by a resident risen resurrected christ and headship over his body he said you think i'm beside myself we got the devil's answer it's not me that liveth but christ the word is living in me it's not my idea it's not my power it's his power it's not my word it's his word he promised it and here he is he said it would be here we got the answer [Applause] christ has risen and has paid the price for our redemption what god in christ manifested he gave that flesh that blood that in that blood might come to life and the flesh be redeemed and the god and that god the redeemed flesh can manifest his word for the day as he did and for this day as he did in that day whoa glory he said you see it oh my he is the same yesterday today and forever he said then we stand justified in the presence of god as a drop of ink dropping into a full tub of bleach you'll never find a stain of ink no more anywhere did you hear that we have the answer amen that woman thy sins are forgiven not just forgiven but justified as though you've never done it in the first place [Applause] when the devil comes with your past you say what sins are you talking about what a man is truly redeemed that presses that predestinated seed sees it and accepted his sins are demolished it's gone it's dropped in the ink of the blood of jesus christ it never be remembered no more god forgets it and he stands as a son or daughter of god in the presence of god now we are sons of god not we will be we are right now we have satan's answer that's right amen did you hear me we have satan's answer because god has vindicated himself god has proved himself to his promise in this day the headship is here christ the risen lord is here with the same power of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself there's the devil's answer he said well that was back 50 years ago no we have the same answer he is here he has declared himself to be here he has declared he's the same healer he's the same deliverer he's the same god as he ever was that's the reason when men when this man sitting here dry he said drop dead the other day we could say come back to life why because the holy spirit said so that's what wyatt could do that to let a little baby in mexico have been dead for 15 hours when a vision said call it back to from death to life and let the baby live and the baby that the doctors wrote a statement died nine o'clock that morning and eleven o'clock that night came back to life again and is living today is there anything too hard for the lord so i was talking to the lord today i said father you see my mom's having these brain bleeds four of them now i said but i know a man whose brain had decayed dead in the grave four days and you brought him back to life again we hear of a baby that was dead for over 12 hours brought back to life again want to do that he had to heal every organ amen the head showed and the body has become one unit do we realize the day we're living in it's not us alone it's him and us working together amen one body one head one one rulership he said that's the reason the white husband and wife is no longer twained they're one god in this church is one christ in you god's great revelation even bearing his name his name is jesus the anointed one that's the reason he's called jesus because he's the anointed one that's the reason you're called miss jesus because you're the anointed one amen proving manifesting god like he did that body did back there and that body redeemed every one of these bodies and through their god worked his threefold manifestation go into the kingdom risen praise and repaid the price were redeemed god has proved it and we stand justified in christ before him and therefore we will not go to the judgment hallelujah because we've already got the answer for it he said oh if i could get the world to see that there you are there's the body of christ living standing redeemed justified in his sight we are of his victory did you hear that we are his victory we come forth in this last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose he's taken it personal he died for this purpose and we're proof of his victory and when we see him coming down living among the church that's his victory it shows that he couldn't keep good and keep him in the grave neither can they keep us [Music] hello somebody they couldn't keep him in the grave then and you're not going to keep this bride in the grave now but she's going to have life in her she's going to be a living breathing epistle written of man amen i've written really rid of my goodness she's going to be a walking talking example of christ the answer for laodicea the answer for every trouble that's ever hit the per a person she is the answer [Applause] that's why she as a body can look at that devil and say devil how to fire you you take your hands off of god's property you're not taking them from this life we defile you in the name of jesus we are the answer we are the voice brother would call us the final voice to the final wage in other words if you're the final voice your voice means more than the devil's voice your voice has more power than the devil's voice has your voice has more power than cancer have sugar diabetes have sin of every kind has your voice is the answer hallelujah you have been called to speak to the mountains and those mountains be removed and cast into the sea hallelujah he cast censor he cast that brain bleed one time he did it two times he did it three times he gonna do it again because he's the same god today as he ever won i will restore saith the lord he is the answer to the devil's question faith is in the body faith to believe all things are possible [Applause] well hallelujah the fruit is the answer of the seed oh my oh hallelujah he said by their fruits you shall know them amen so it reveals what the seed is the fruit does that's right so if the fruit is critical and sour and bitter that ain't they ain't the seed of god come on now i read my bible that say that that fruit as you're casting down criticizing worship and criticizing things and calling a bunch of fanaticism and emotional i question your seed i question who you really are amen because i can see you in the quotes i can see in the bible brother hasn't blessed me so much as a little boy had been in a wheelchair been bound in that thing and he was pronounced healing over his body you know how he was pronounced it you're healed in the name of jesus christ by his stripes you're healed as far as i know it wasn't a vision maybe maybe it was i didn't catch that but he said he told him he said by his stripes you're healed he took that and he began to confess it he began to speak it everywhere he went rolling around in his wheelchair and go up to any service heim's healed why are you healed because by his stripes i'm healed it was the answer to his question and he wasn't going to let that answer go until a bunch of ministers got around and said you know what you're causing a real show here you're bringing a disgrace on the name of the name of christ a reproach he looked at them ministers he said how can i be doing that he said let me ask you this if you were sitting where i'm sitting would you take the last hope i got by his stripes i'm healed and at that moment his body matched his confession the answer came down into his body and out of that wheelchair he went running around praising god oh come on now all you got to do is say god you said it i believe it you said it i'm going to stand on it i'm not backing up i'm not turning around i'm going to stand on the answer why stand on doubt why stand on criticism why stand on fear and unbelief stand on the answer stand on the one who paid the price who gave you the victory hallelujah it's the same fruit it's the same word it's the same life it's the same god it's the same spirit it's the same book it's the same size these things that i do shall you do also i got an answer to burn women he said i'll make you a more joyful mother a keeper at your house and be a joyful mother of children that devil wants to come and howl in our ears and say it ain't so he's a lie i ain't standing on his i'm not going to step up a promise and step on his life i'm going to stay on a promise he said it was her night it was her night he said it was thus saith the lord it's not saith the lord i'm not moving off of it oh hallelujah he said to ezekiel when he was standing in the valley of dry balls he said well these bones live again he said they'll know us he said won't you prophesy he began to prophesy he said hear ye tripons the word of the lord the sin you and skin begin to come bone upon pawn as they heard the prophecy begin to go forth and it began their body begin even though it's dry and broken apart it seemed to be no hope but the prophecy the answer was greater than the dry bones [Applause] [Music] he said at the end the breath of god breathed to them and they stood as a mighty army marching towards zion that's him the victory hey let me show you something got a goliath i got an answer for him [Music] amen david had him facing that goliath that morning he had an answer his answer wasn't who he was i'm some great big guy i'm this happiness i've been trained no it was who his god was his god is he said i don't come to you in that name i come to you in the name of the god of abraham isaac and of jacob and on this day i'm going to take your head off the answer had been laying in the valley all it needed was somebody to walk down into the valley and pick up an answer that looks like i had to answer that right there i shall restore saith the lord [Music] with the palm of worm and canker worm every kind of other worm devil worms has stripped away i shall restore saith the lord listen i believe i'm just going to give it to you in my heart as i come home yesterday these words kept ringing in my ear a series of victories this will be a series of victories this will be a series of victories oh yeah i got four more in there if there's any more devils hey amen that's what david was looking at he was looking at a series of victory he wasn't wanting just this victory he's wanting every victory god had for him oh hallelujah there's going to be a lot of victories we're about to see it happen we're about to see god moving in realms that we ain't never seen before why you say that because i see people's expectation getting to the place god can move like that god can answer like that god can turn and change a scene just in a moment i believe we're getting to the moment aiming babies to jump out of arms and run across the platform run across the aisle i believe we're getting to a moment that life is coming into the body i believe we're right here that my brains are going to be restored amen things have been cancer's running out of the building he's the same god i'm going to stand on the answer hallelujah i know what he said and he's going to do what he said i have come down oh let's give god praise for a moment he's our god oh if he's forgiven you of your sins you ought to be to praise him if he's healed you already you ought to be an appraiser if you haven't received your healing yeah go ahead and praise him because he's got the answer for it [Applause] the devil's a liar we cast down his unbelief we cast down his lies and we lift up the answer say yes lord you are god you are the god yes lord you are the god i've seen the answer by far i've seen you moving and seeing you change it all y'all can remain standing i'm bringing us down he said can you plant a seed without a man what it is no not if it's growing i said can you plant a grain of corn without making corn not if it's growing can you plant a potato let's say raisin potato can you plant a flower without it being the that kind of flower the fruit is the answer of the seed then if you're sowed and the seed of god in your heart has got to produce that jesus said he shall do my works if he believes me he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also even more than this for i go to my father he said wow that's strong if they can just don't hit the skidding place and slide off don't slide off of it slide on to it they just fall down the valley so the winds can blow it away and the fowls can get it don't let that happen let it grow jesus said your name is in the palm of my hands how is it going to be forgotten how can you ever be forgotten he said then if jesus defeated satan upon the faith knowing who he was he was a predestinated creature are you ready what about the predestinated bride of jesus christ you believe the bride is predestinated the predestinated bride of christ right now the church the with the word
