[48:47] vessel lord i pray that you would reach
[48:49] out and touch those hands that were
[48:50] lifted up lord they didn't lift their
[48:52] hands to a man actually they defied
[48:54] gravity to begin to lift up a hand and
[48:57] need that that you would come by their
[49:00] way and father that's what we're
[49:02] desiring here is just one more time that
[49:05] you would come by our way lord bless
[49:07] bless us as we read your word this
[49:09] morning in the name of jesus christ amen
[49:13] ezekiel chapter 37 and verse 1 and the
[49:16] bible said that the hand of the lord was
[49:18] upon me and carried me out in the spirit
[49:21] and set me down in the midst of the
[49:23] valley which was full of bones and
[49:26] caused me to pass by them round about
[49:29] and behold there were very many in the
[49:31] open valley and lo
[49:33] they were very dry
[49:35] and he said unto me son of man can these
[49:37] bones live and i answered o lord god
[49:40] thou knowest
[49:41] again he said unto me prophesy upon
[49:43] these bones and say unto them o ye dry
[49:45] bones hear the word of the lord thus
[49:48] saith the lord
[49:50] god under these bones behold i will
[49:52] cause breath to enter into you and you
[49:54] shall live
[49:56] and i will lay sinews upon you and i
[49:58] will bring up flesh upon you and cover
[50:00] you with skin and put breath in you and
[50:02] you shall live and you shall know that i
[50:04] am the lord so i prophesied as i was
[50:07] commanded and as i prophesied there was
[50:09] a noise and behold a shaking and the
[50:11] bones came together bone to his bone and
[50:14] when i beheld lo the sinews and the
[50:17] flesh came upon them and the skin
[50:19] covered them above but there was no
[50:21] breath in them
[50:23] then said he unto me prophesy unto the
[50:25] wind prophesy son of man and say unto
[50:28] the wind to thus save the lord god come
[50:31] from the four winds o breath and breathe
[50:34] upon thee slain that they might live so
[50:36] i prophesied as he commanded me and the
[50:39] breath came into them and they lived and
[50:42] stood up
[50:43] upon their feet and exceeding great army
[50:46] then he said unto me son of man can
[50:48] these bones these bones are the whole
[50:50] house of israel behold they they say our
[50:53] bones are dried and our hope is lost we
[50:55] are cut off from our parts therefore
[50:58] prophesy and say unto them thus saith
[51:01] the lord god behold o my people i will
[51:04] open your graves and cause you to come
[51:06] out of your graves and bring you into
[51:08] the land of israel and you shall know
[51:11] that i am the lord when i have opened
[51:12] your graves on my people and brought you
[51:15] up out of your graves and shall put my
[51:18] spirit in you and you shall live and i
[51:20] shall place you in your own land then
[51:23] you shall know that i the lord have
[51:25] spoken it and performed it saith the
[51:28] lord
[51:29] amen god bless you this morning we'll
[51:31] let you have your seats i'd like to take
[51:34] a just a for a few moments from this
[51:36] thought i've spoke from this chapter
[51:38] many times but i'd like to take from
[51:40] this thought this morning there ain't no
[51:42] grave going to hold this body down
[51:47] there ain't no grave gonna hold this
[51:50] body down and i love what ezekiel taps
[51:52] into here he reaches in and he sees
[51:55] something and i love it when god does
[51:57] something and you know that it's him
[51:59] when god does something and it's not a
[52:01] man
[52:02] because god will get the glory out of
[52:04] all things because when god does
[52:06] something you will see the
[52:07] materialization
[52:08] of the power of the spoken word of god
[52:11] when he said prophesy then you begin to
[52:13] watch the materialization
[52:15] of those promises as they're coming to
[52:17] pass but you begin to look in through
[52:20] the bible and you begin to look in
[52:21] genesis and you're looking all the way
[52:23] through all the way up to christ and you
[52:25] can see that that through the fall of
[52:27] humanity that death was the very first
[52:30] thing that god would speak to man that
[52:32] if he would do this certain deed if he
[52:34] would partake of the tree of the
[52:35] knowledge of good and evil that he would
[52:38] surely die and so we realized that death
[52:41] was one of the first things that was
[52:42] spoken of when god begins to speak to
[52:45] man and man had always feared death
[52:47] because man didn't know what was on the
[52:49] other side of it they had no ever they
[52:51] had no assurance of ever coming back and
[52:54] even job when he was standing there and
[52:56] he was
[52:57] as we understand that he was one of the
[52:59] fir it was one of the first bible books
[53:01] of the bible but job himself and all of
[53:04] the torimo of life that he was going
[53:06] through when when satan touched his life
[53:09] and satan cursed everything that he was
[53:11] and he come to the spot in life and he
[53:13] looked out upon nature and he's seen the
[53:15] trees budding he's seen the flowers that
[53:17] they would pass away in the winter time
[53:19] and he would watch in springtime how
[53:21] that they would come back but he asked
[53:23] this question i don't believe it's a
[53:25] great question if a man dies shall he
[53:28] live again and he said all these days of
[53:31] my life i will wait i will wait till my
[53:34] change come you see man was looking for
[53:37] an escape of the grave so it tells us
[53:39] that as soon as we begin to look we
[53:41] begin to look at humanity that they're
[53:44] looking at a way out you see man was
[53:47] built to live forever but because of the
[53:49] fall in the garden of eden there was a
[53:51] curse that was put on man but there was
[53:54] a god that was bigger than a curse there
[53:57] was a god that would come by the way of
[54:00] a redeemer and make of a way of escape
[54:02] for you and i and the humanity was
[54:05] looking for that escape every prophet
[54:07] would testify that i'm looking for this
[54:09] escape they're looking for that redeemer
[54:11] they're looking for that one that is
[54:13] able to roll away the reproach are you
[54:16] with me you see all the prophets testify
[54:19] that we needed a redeemer even even you
[54:22] look over at dave and you begin to find
[54:24] that david would tap into a channel of a
[54:26] believer and he would begin to look in
[54:28] there and he'd begin to call out things
[54:31] about the grave and call out things
[54:32] about death i as a as a young minister
[54:35] as a young pastor i have stood i have
[54:38] stood at the at the feet at the feet of
[54:41] caskets i have stood at a pulpit and
[54:43] i've had to preach funerals for little
[54:45] bitty babies i've had to preach funerals
[54:47] for for old generals but i can tell you
[54:50] the greatest assurance that i have when
[54:52] i stand behind somebody that is going on
[54:54] to be with the lord is when i can direct
[54:57] the people or the family that is
[54:59] surrounding them that there is a hope
[55:01] beyond this life what an amazing thing
[55:04] for for young people to look at you're
[55:06] not going to live forever in this in
[55:08] this humanity but to know where you're
[55:10] going but be as a minister to stand
[55:13] there and tell them you don't have to
[55:15] worry this is not the end this is just
[55:17] the beginning when they took their last
[55:19] breath here it was their first breath
[55:21] there you see death is not a respecter
[55:24] of persons death don't care how old you
[55:26] are death don't care how smart you are
[55:29] death don't care how rich you are death
[55:31] don't care how poor you are it's not a
[55:33] respecter of persons but death will come
[55:35] to you and there's only thing there's
[55:37] only one thing that's standing between
[55:39] you and death and it's a heartbeat as my
[55:41] granddaddy homer fraser would say that's
[55:43] a mighty small thing that's standing
[55:45] between you and god but you realize that
[55:48] david was tapping into a channel when he
[55:50] started looking at the grave and he
[55:53] contemplated what the grave was and the
[55:55] power of the grave and david grabbed
[55:58] over in psalms 49 that god will redeem
[56:01] my soul from the power of the grave even
[56:05] though you go by the way of the grave
[56:07] there's a god that knows how to get you
[56:09] back into a body that doesn't wear it
[56:12] doesn't wear out but he can pick you up
[56:16] and take you out of the grave i don't
[56:18] believe that's just talking about the
[56:19] natural grave but any grave that you're
[56:22] in young people you can get out of that
[56:24] grave because there is a redeemer that
[56:27] has the power over hell death and the
[56:30] grave when he rose up on easter morning
[56:33] he rose up he was not keyless he was not
[56:37] clueless he had the keys of death hell
[56:40] and the grave
[56:42] there ain't no grave going to hold this
[56:46] body down
[56:50] oh hallelujah
[56:53] hallelujah
[56:56] the bible said in hebrews 2 that that we
[56:59] see jesus
[57:00] there's a lot of people that don't know
[57:02] jesus but we see jesus
[57:04] who was made a little lower than the
[57:06] angels for the suffering of death
[57:08] crowned with glory and honor that he
[57:11] by the grace of god should taste
[57:14] death
[57:16] for every man
[57:18] you see all of those prophecies that the
[57:20] prophets had foretold us were hooked in
[57:23] this one man jesus
[57:27] job asks the question if a man dies
[57:29] shall he live again
[57:31] he pondered these things shall i live
[57:33] again
[57:34] i can see all of these things i can see
[57:36] what i'm going through but can i live
[57:38] again
[57:39] and brother branham caught it as he as
[57:41] job went into that realm of a believer
[57:44] and he broke down something that gives
[57:47] every person
[57:50] every person a hope that job when the
[57:53] lightnings begin to flash and the
[57:55] thunders begin to roll he grabbed a
[57:57] revelation for every prophet all the way
[58:00] to abraham isaac and jacob he would say
[58:03] i know that my redeemer lives
[58:09] yet in my flesh
[58:11] i will see god
[58:13] you see easter proved
[58:15] easter proved that man that had been
[58:18] shut up in a prison house
[58:21] young people they get the idea that
[58:23] they're superman and they can live
[58:24] forever
[58:26] but this flesh is fleeting and it's
[58:27] failing
[58:28] and man was put in a prison house and
[58:31] this air is an escape
[58:33] death is an escape
[58:35] for a real believer
[58:37] let me just let me just stop right here
[58:38] for a moment for a real believer
[58:41] death
[58:42] can be a friend
[58:45] death can get you out of this old pest
[58:47] house
[58:48] but i don't want to just talk to a
[58:50] people about death today
[58:53] i don't believe that you were ordained
[58:55] to die i believe with all of my heart
[58:58] that i am preaching to a people that
[59:00] will not go by the way of the grave
[59:03] i want to say to the body of the living
[59:06] god there will not be one grace
[59:11] there won't be one grave you can name it
[59:13] you can call it what you want to there
[59:16] won't be one grave of trinitarianism
[59:18] that'll hold us down there won't be no
[59:20] evie easy believers that'll hold us down
[59:23] there won't be no false doctrine that'll
[59:26] hold us down there ain't no grave gonna
[59:29] hold this body down
[59:37] let me give you something else to shout
[59:39] about he's not the god of the dead he's
[59:42] the god of the living
[59:46] abraham when abraham when he when he
[59:48] watched when death would begin to come
[59:50] by his way when he took his sweetheart
[59:53] away from him
[59:54] and abraham is looking for a piece of
[59:57] ground that he could bury his sweetheart
[1:00:00] in he goes to the sons of heth and he
[1:00:03] goes to them and he says i want to
[1:00:05] purchase this piece of property i want
[1:00:08] to buy this cave off of you mcpahilla
[1:00:11] and i want to purchase it off of you and
[1:00:14] they said no we'll we'll give it to you
[1:00:16] for free you don't even have to buy it
[1:00:18] from us but abraham understood he was
[1:00:21] wanting to give them a witness
[1:00:24] you see they were just wanting to give
[1:00:26] it to him but he wanted a possession
[1:00:29] he wanted a possession that he could
[1:00:31] call his own that this
[1:00:33] is where i have buried my sweetheart out
[1:00:36] you see they did the same thing satan
[1:00:38] did the same thing with jesus he tried
[1:00:41] to offer him a kingdom without a calvary
[1:00:45] and satan will try to offer you religion
[1:00:48] without a baptism of the holy ghost
[1:00:51] you remember when satan offers you the
[1:00:54] easy way out it ain't the easy way it's
[1:00:56] hale's way
[1:00:57] [Applause]
[1:01:00] but he said i
[1:01:01] want to purchase this piece of property
[1:01:05] for as much money as it is worth
[1:01:09] i'm willing to pay whatever it costs and
[1:01:12] it goes down in history as the most
[1:01:15] expensive piece of property that was
[1:01:18] ever told
[1:01:19] do you realize that on the cross 2000
[1:01:22] years ago that you were the greatest you
[1:01:26] were the most expensive you were the
[1:01:28] people
[1:01:29] that god was willing to pay whatever it
[1:01:32] costs
[1:01:34] whatever it costs
[1:01:37] when he stood there with that revelation
[1:01:39] that i'm going to buy this piece of
[1:01:41] property you see he got a hold of job's
[1:01:44] revelation he said if job is going to be
[1:01:47] buried there and job said i know that my
[1:01:50] redeemer liveth that in my flesh yet i
[1:01:53] see god he said i want to be buried
[1:01:55] wherever where job is buried at
[1:01:58] bury me close because job's got a
[1:02:00] revelation that he's going to see the
[1:02:02] redeemer
[1:02:03] [Music]
[1:02:04] all of them prophets they were looking
[1:02:07] at it he said i'm buying this piece of
[1:02:09] property for my son isaac for myself for
[1:02:12] jacob and for joseph
[1:02:14] you see they caught a revelation that
[1:02:16] there was one coming that had the
[1:02:18] ability to raise them up
[1:02:23] out of the grave
[1:02:24] [Applause]
[1:02:30] and jacob
[1:02:31] and joseph when they were there in egypt
[1:02:34] he made him lay his hands on him
[1:02:37] lay your hands right here
[1:02:39] where the angel touched me and i started
[1:02:41] walking differently
[1:02:43] you lay your hands right here and you
[1:02:45] make me an oath that you'll not bury my
[1:02:48] bones down here in egypt
[1:02:50] we see because those prophets realize
[1:02:52] that there was no resurrection power
[1:02:54] down there in egypt there was no
[1:02:56] resurrection power down there in
[1:02:58] laodicea there was no resurrection power
[1:03:01] down there to methodists nor at the
[1:03:03] mennonite church or the amish church or
[1:03:06] the catholic church
[1:03:08] they said don't you bury me down there
[1:03:10] in that trinitary watery grave all they
[1:03:12] want to do is sprinkle a little dirt on
[1:03:14] you that ain't got no resurrection power
[1:03:17] but if you're gonna baptize me you
[1:03:19] baptize me where there's life at in the
[1:03:21] name of jesus christ
[1:03:24] how do you get in that body by one
[1:03:26] spirit we're baptized into that body
[1:03:30] you bury me down there where there ain't
[1:03:31] no life
[1:03:32] you make a covenant with me swear by me
[1:03:35] that you'll carry these bones out of
[1:03:37] here
[1:03:38] young people there's only one name that
[1:03:40] you can be buried in and have the faith
[1:03:43] to get up out of the grave
[1:03:45] his name is jesus
[1:03:52] pharaoh said no you're going to stay
[1:03:54] right here jacob said no i'm going out
[1:03:57] of here joseph made that covenant you
[1:04:00] lay your hands on this coffin tell me
[1:04:03] don't leave me down here and even though
[1:04:06] you might be walking past this coffin
[1:04:08] it's telling you that there is a promise
[1:04:11] there is a redeemer that is coming that
[1:04:14] has the ability to take this body
[1:04:17] out of the grave
[1:04:19] you may be stuck down here and lay on us
[1:04:21] here and you may feel like our hope is
[1:04:23] gone but andrew spencer came all the way
[1:04:26] from elkton virginia to tell you there
[1:04:28] ain't no graves
[1:04:33] don't you bury me down here and some
[1:04:35] easy believe ism don't you bury me down
[1:04:38] here in your watered-down gospel of the
[1:04:40] message of push and play
[1:04:42] there ain't no life in push and play but
[1:04:45] there is life in this game yesterday
[1:04:48] today and forever
[1:04:50] he's a living god he knows what you're
[1:04:52] going through you ain't got to give him
[1:04:54] your resume he don't need to know what
[1:04:56] you've been through and what you're
[1:04:57] going to go through he's always been
[1:04:59] there
[1:05:05] the reason i can stand here in passion
[1:05:07] and with power and testify to you i've
[1:05:10] seen that jesus
[1:05:12] i've witnessed that jesus i've handled
[1:05:15] that jesus
[1:05:19] [Applause]
[1:05:22] my dad said on the way down here
[1:05:24] satan hang on
[1:05:26] it's going to be a bad ride
[1:05:34] my mama
[1:05:42] there ain't no grave
[1:05:44] gonna hold my body down
[1:05:47] there ain't no gray
[1:05:50] gonna hold my body down
[1:05:55] for my man came death and by man came
[1:05:58] the resurrection of the dead for as adam
[1:06:02] all die even so in christ shall you be
[1:06:05] made alive
[1:06:07] you see satan
[1:06:08] wants to send you to a premature grave
[1:06:11] he's already caught your burial place
[1:06:13] picked out where he's going to lay you
[1:06:15] down maybe he's trying to pick out
[1:06:17] pornography maybe he's trying to pick
[1:06:19] out a grave sign of lust maybe he's
[1:06:21] trying to pick out a graveside of
[1:06:23] depression and he says you're going to
[1:06:25] be buried there but jesus come to tell
[1:06:27] you there ain't no grave
[1:06:30] gonna hold my body down
[1:06:34] you can try to bury him with doubt and
[1:06:37] fear and all kinds of things
[1:06:40] but only on sunday morning
[1:06:43] ah
[1:06:44] i watched my redeemer get up out of the
[1:06:47] grave and the same power that raised
[1:06:49] jesus christ from the grave is alive and
[1:06:52] well living in a young people
[1:06:55] and satan ain't got enough power to stop
[1:06:58] you
[1:07:02] hallelujah
[1:07:04] he'll try to bury you in drugs and
[1:07:06] alcohol
[1:07:07] formalism but the god of this message
[1:07:09] says shut up devil
[1:07:11] there's an empty tomb
[1:07:15] i will walk before the lord
[1:07:17] in the land
[1:07:19] of the living
[1:07:21] [Applause]
[1:07:23] you see satan is doing his very best
[1:07:26] to corrupt our young people
[1:07:28] he's trying his very best to bring them
[1:07:31] some dr dobson idea
[1:07:34] that you can break out these seven
[1:07:36] points and you will have overcoming
[1:07:38] power
[1:07:39] let me tell you i didn't have to go
[1:07:41] through seven steps
[1:07:43] i didn't have to go through dr dobson's
[1:07:45] idea to get over corruption i just had
[1:07:48] one encounter with elohim
[1:07:52] he changed my thinking he changed my
[1:07:54] walking but satan is trying his very
[1:07:57] best to corrupt our young people
[1:07:59] he's trying to corrupt the body
[1:08:02] he's trying to set in corruption in the
[1:08:04] government and you can see that they are
[1:08:05] obeying and kneeling to his power
[1:08:08] but there is a people on earth that will
[1:08:10] not bow to his corruption
[1:08:13] you can have faith this morning to know
[1:08:16] that jesus knew so emphatically who he
[1:08:19] was that he could go
[1:08:21] to hell
[1:08:25] on a backslidden preacher's word
[1:08:29] on a backslidden preacher's word but yet
[1:08:32] he was so inspired that jesus said that
[1:08:36] he trusted every single one of those
[1:08:38] words that the prophet had spoke
[1:08:43] i
[1:08:44] will not let my holy one see corruption
[1:08:48] you see he so trusted it that not one
[1:08:51] cell of his body would corrupt
[1:08:56] now notice what the prophet says here
[1:08:58] he said when the word was spoke and said
[1:09:01] i'll not sever my holy one to see
[1:09:02] corruption neither will i leave his soul
[1:09:05] in hell there wasn't enough time
[1:09:08] there wasn't enough devils there wasn't
[1:09:10] enough anything to keep christ in the
[1:09:12] grave do his body begin to rot because
[1:09:14] the law of god
[1:09:16] would bring the word to pass and the law
[1:09:18] of god by the holy spirit brings any
[1:09:20] promise to pass
[1:09:22] regardless
[1:09:23] of the conditions
[1:09:25] job said though these skin worms destroy
[1:09:27] my body yet in my flesh i see god
[1:09:30] notice what the prophet says to you
[1:09:33] regardless of how little we are how low
[1:09:36] we are how impure we are how unholy we
[1:09:40] are how sick we are how afflicted we are
[1:09:43] the law of god's spirit by his word
[1:09:46] makes it obey and forces the issue and
[1:09:49] says give it back
[1:09:52] oh if we could just think of that for a
[1:09:54] moment it forces it regardless of
[1:09:57] conditions no matter what the condition
[1:10:00] is the law of god's word forces the
[1:10:03] condition to cope with his word it's got
[1:10:07] to
[1:10:08] so you can name your condition or you
[1:10:10] can name your grave but the word will
[1:10:13] make and force its way so that it will
[1:10:16] cope to the word of god you know
[1:10:18] cancer's been obeying a body
[1:10:21] i'm not talking about this flesh but i'm
[1:10:23] talking about your body
[1:10:24] that cancer has been obeying a body
[1:10:28] because a body has said cancer you can't
[1:10:31] have ron spencer
[1:10:32] cancer you can't have susan hershberg
[1:10:35] cancer you can't have erica parker
[1:10:39] you see jesus so knew who he was that he
[1:10:43] would say that i have power to lay my
[1:10:46] life down and i have power to take it up
[1:10:49] again
[1:10:50] and jesus had an unfailing faith in his
[1:10:53] position to know that he was the perfect
[1:10:56] born son of god
[1:10:58] [Music]
[1:11:00] and if your faith will put you in
[1:11:02] position to know that every divine
[1:11:04] promise of god's bible is for you you
[1:11:07] can walk out of that sin
[1:11:10] you can walk out of that depression you
[1:11:12] can walk out of that complex you can
[1:11:15] come out of that turtle shell that makes
[1:11:17] you sit there with your arm crossed said
[1:11:19] i'm not going to get emotional if you're
[1:11:21] god
[1:11:22] you're bound to get emotional
[1:11:24] you say what's going on down there and
[1:11:26] evening like tabernacle i hear a
[1:11:28] rattling
[1:11:32] i hear a shaking taking place get ready
[1:11:35] you just get ready but i'm not going to
[1:11:37] get emotional you wait till dry bones
[1:11:40] start taking on flesh you wait till they
[1:11:43] start taking on mushrooms they don't
[1:11:45] just grab the mechanics they grab the
[1:11:47] dynamics of the holy ghost and all of a
[1:11:49] sudden the wind comes across those dry
[1:11:52] bones
[1:12:03] he's tried his best to corrupt you but
[1:12:05] you are born again not of a corruptable
[1:12:08] seed but you are born again of the
[1:12:10] incorruptible seed of the genealogy of
[1:12:13] almighty god that he deposited before
[1:12:16] the foundation of the world
[1:12:18] and that seed has the power it has the
[1:12:21] capacity to handle what it's supposed to
[1:12:24] go through
[1:12:24] [Applause]
[1:12:26] you may go through some stuff how many's
[1:12:28] went through some stuff
[1:12:29] some stuff
[1:12:31] you know what that does it just makes a
[1:12:32] better ground to break out of
[1:12:35] [Applause]
[1:12:37] oh yeah you say there's no way i'm
[1:12:39] coming up out of all this dirt you don't
[1:12:41] understand all the things that i've
[1:12:42] built up in my life and all the darkness
[1:12:45] of sin that i've gone through let me
[1:12:47] tell you that's where beauty is made at
[1:12:50] you may not understand that but let me
[1:12:52] tell you that's where your beauty is
[1:12:54] breaking forth at
[1:12:58] he said well i just don't know
[1:13:00] i just don't know if i can really break
[1:13:02] through
[1:13:03] let me tell you i watched young people
[1:13:04] last night that stood here under a power
[1:13:08] of a demonic spirit that would try to
[1:13:10] hold them down but i watched the living
[1:13:12] god come and break chains over them
[1:13:21] the father
[1:13:22] is seeking those that will worship him
[1:13:25] in spirit and in truth
[1:13:28] now as children
[1:13:29] we all used to love playing hide and go
[1:13:31] seek
[1:13:32] but can you imagine almighty god
[1:13:34] seeking out
[1:13:36] he's hunting do you believe his brothers
[1:13:38] that god himself
[1:13:40] has got himself a rifle on his back and
[1:13:42] is hunting out people that will worship
[1:13:45] him with spirit and in truth well you
[1:13:47] say what is that rifle doing on his back
[1:13:49] it's there just in case the devil shows
[1:13:51] up to stop you from worshiping he'll
[1:13:54] shoot him with a double-barrel shotgun
[1:13:56] of the word
[1:14:01] you see god's looking for somebody
[1:14:03] god's looking for a body that he can
[1:14:05] live in a body that he can move in when
[1:14:07] you say my dad is a pastor my daddy's a
[1:14:10] preacher my granddad is a preacher i can
[1:14:13] just go in on the coattail of my daddy's
[1:14:16] experience i think brother danny did a
[1:14:18] wonderful job of saying you can't ride
[1:14:20] in on somebody else's hotel
[1:14:23] i'm not gonna move because i've heard
[1:14:26] all 1100 and some sermons of the
[1:14:28] prophet's ministry and it's not gonna
[1:14:31] move me
[1:14:32] you just stay there in your pity and
[1:14:34] your waller and all of your doubt while
[1:14:36] the rest of us go ahead and shout
[1:14:41] you can sit on me you can try to stop me
[1:14:44] from preaching but i
[1:14:46] know that the father is seeking those
[1:14:49] that will worship him in spirit and in
[1:14:51] truth you know that the prophet said
[1:14:53] that it's god's strategy to take him
[1:14:56] empty human vessels and shake the world
[1:14:59] with them
[1:15:01] shake the world
[1:15:03] with them
[1:15:04] so god
[1:15:06] is looking
[1:15:07] for dry bones
[1:15:08] that he could put his life in
[1:15:13] jesus said in matthew 5 and 25 the hour
[1:15:16] is coming and now is when the dead shall
[1:15:18] hear the voice of the son of god and
[1:15:20] they that hear shall live verse 28
[1:15:23] marvel not at this for the hour is
[1:15:25] coming
[1:15:26] in the which all that are in the graves
[1:15:28] shall hear his voice
[1:15:33] it's time
[1:15:35] to get out of it
[1:15:37] the voice of the living god is speaking
[1:15:39] it's time to get up out of that grief
[1:15:42] you see the head
[1:15:44] rose up on easter morning and the body
[1:15:47] has to follow what the head does
[1:15:49] so if we have the mind of christ we've
[1:15:52] got to think like the mind of christ we
[1:15:54] got to speak like the mighty christ we
[1:15:56] cannot wallor in our defeat you were not
[1:15:59] put here to be in defeat you were put
[1:16:02] here to be the victorious blameless
[1:16:05] spotless body of jesus christ
[1:16:11] as a man thinketh in his heart
[1:16:14] so
[1:16:15] is he
[1:16:16] so if you think yourself a winner you're
[1:16:18] going to be a winner and if you think
[1:16:19] yourself a loser you're gonna be a loser
[1:16:22] but you were not seen here in defeat
[1:16:25] the enemy that's his job to make you
[1:16:27] feel defeated and get so depressed so
[1:16:29] shook up you don't know if god loves you
[1:16:32] i'm not preaching hard to you to tell
[1:16:34] you this but i'm trying to tell you that
[1:16:35] i love you
[1:16:37] i love you but somebody bigger than me
[1:16:39] loves you
[1:16:41] you were not seen here in defeat
[1:16:46] you were not seen here overcome by the
[1:16:48] enemy
[1:16:50] it's completely opposite
[1:16:52] because job was asked the question where
[1:16:55] was your job
[1:16:56] when i when i framed the world and i
[1:16:59] made the foundation of the world where
[1:17:01] was you
[1:17:02] you was not seen there in defeat you
[1:17:05] were seen there shouting and when you
[1:17:07] are shouting that means you got the
[1:17:09] victory
[1:17:10] [Applause]
[1:17:16] the head is connected to the body so the
[1:17:18] body has got to come up
[1:17:21] you know i
[1:17:23] i as
[1:17:25] a young minister
[1:17:26] i've had i've had my fair share of
[1:17:28] funerals i guess it's cause i got thrown
[1:17:30] into it early
[1:17:31] but i've had
[1:17:32] i wouldn't say it's a pleasure but i've
[1:17:34] had the the opportunity
[1:17:37] to go
[1:17:39] buy a lot of caskets
[1:17:41] see a lot of brothers and sisters has
[1:17:42] done one that went on to be with the
[1:17:44] lord
[1:17:44] but you know something i absolutely
[1:17:46] despise brother day i absolutely hate it
[1:17:49] when you're standing there by a casket
[1:17:52] and they're just standing there and
[1:17:54] they're looking down
[1:17:55] oh
[1:17:56] don't they look good
[1:17:59] they just really caught their
[1:18:01] personality
[1:18:02] i told my wife if she if i die by the
[1:18:05] way the grave and you come and stand
[1:18:07] over top of my casket and you say oh
[1:18:10] don't he look good i am gonna come back
[1:18:13] and haunt you every day of your life
[1:18:16] oh don't they look good they cocked them
[1:18:18] in their personnel did i look that dead
[1:18:21] in life
[1:18:23] was i that bad
[1:18:25] then i did i looked like on the back of
[1:18:27] hank and my teeth were about to fall out
[1:18:29] but i'm afraid that too many preachers
[1:18:32] are so satisfied with looking at a dead
[1:18:35] body
[1:18:37] oh don't they look good don't they look
[1:18:40] i think they just picture christ that's
[1:18:42] what that's what god mentioned to be
[1:18:45] what kind of gospel are you preaching
[1:18:48] that when you look at a dead body say oh
[1:18:51] they look good i'm looking at a body
[1:18:54] that knows how to dance knows how to
[1:18:57] shout know what it's like to overcome
[1:18:59] temptation
[1:19:01] you look good
[1:19:04] you look good in your dance you look
[1:19:06] good in your south you look good in your
[1:19:09] victory ain't no grave gonna hold this
[1:19:12] body path
[1:19:15] well i look way over jordan i said what
[1:19:18] do you think i see
[1:19:20] i saw a group of young people
[1:19:22] they were coming with jesus
[1:19:28] if the head got up out of the bridge the
[1:19:31] body's got to get up out of the grave
[1:19:33] if there was no corruption that could
[1:19:35] hold him down there'll be no corruption
[1:19:38] that'll hold this fire
[1:19:40] [Applause]
[1:19:50] i'll go ahead and praise the lord
[1:20:00] hang on devil
[1:20:04] gonna be a bad ride
[1:20:15] now
[1:20:16] when ezekiel was standing there
[1:20:19] and you can imagine ezekiel is standing
[1:20:21] there in that valley full of dry bones
[1:20:23] as he's looking out and he's seeing this
[1:20:25] dry bones
[1:20:26] you know i had
[1:20:28] i had a brother bless his heart
[1:20:30] come to me and tell me he said you know
[1:20:32] i got the revelation and if you're
[1:20:34] listening brother i still love you
[1:20:37] bless your heart
[1:20:40] when he looked he said i got the
[1:20:41] revelation of that ezekiel 37. he said i
[1:20:44] got the revelation he said
[1:20:46] everybody's caught up on it being israel
[1:20:49] but i've got the revelation
[1:20:52] it's china
[1:20:54] they've got the greatest army in the
[1:20:56] world
[1:20:57] i thought my brother
[1:20:59] how do i answer this
[1:21:01] go read
[1:21:02] the rest of the chapter
[1:21:06] you know that was a pretty simple
[1:21:08] so i i solved that thing pretty quick
[1:21:11] you know ain't that amazing but i i said
[1:21:14] look and read the rest of the chapter
[1:21:16] but matter of fact take a look right
[1:21:18] here
[1:21:19] you're looking at
[1:21:21] the most powerful army that's on the
[1:21:23] face of the earth
[1:21:25] prophesy son of man can these bones live
[1:21:29] again you're not feeding on the
[1:21:31] unfailing body word of the son of man
[1:21:34] you're feeding oh and you're not feeding
[1:21:37] on the mind of a manual feeling on the
[1:21:38] unfailing body word of the son of man
[1:21:41] that has the power to rake and wake you
[1:21:43] up
[1:21:45] wake up
[1:21:46] if you're in your sin if you're into
[1:21:48] your condition wake up
[1:21:51] the son of man is prophesied
[1:21:54] these bones will live again he said i'm
[1:21:56] not getting up
[1:21:57] i'm not getting up he said prophesy son
[1:21:59] of man can these bones live again
[1:22:03] the life didn't come when the skin was
[1:22:05] on there was four stages
[1:22:07] there's four stages of sin you skin and
[1:22:10] flesh but they never walked
[1:22:13] until the wind came
[1:22:15] and the wind started moving and he said
[1:22:18] son of man breathe oh breath of god
[1:22:21] breathe on them and the prophet said
[1:22:24] that the pentecostal church is born of
[1:22:27] the breath of god
[1:22:30] not of the devil would like to tell you
[1:22:32] that you're all right the way you are
[1:22:33] he'd like to tell you that you're okay
[1:22:35] in your dead cold formal church
[1:22:37] you can stand there in your muscles you
[1:22:39] can flex your muscles
[1:22:42] there's a little bitty boy here six
[1:22:43] years old it's got muscles
[1:22:45] and he likes flexing them
[1:22:47] but he's got more than just muscles
[1:22:50] he's got a living god there
[1:22:52] he's witness a living god
[1:22:55] but the enemy would like to tell you
[1:22:56] that you're okay
[1:22:58] living in your flesh
[1:23:01] you're okay
[1:23:02] living with the mechanics
[1:23:05] but if the breath of god isn't there
[1:23:07] the answer praise the inspiration of god
[1:23:11] if it isn't breathing on you you'll stay
[1:23:13] there in that dead cold formal church
[1:23:15] you won't ever move when the spirit
[1:23:17] moves
[1:23:18] but there is a word that will put this
[1:23:21] body back into shape
[1:23:22] there is a word that is inspired by the
[1:23:24] move of god that is that men of god are
[1:23:27] influenced and inspired by god and they
[1:23:30] are prophesying they are speaking again
[1:23:33] what the mighty angel has said you're
[1:23:35] not sitting here under the ministry of a
[1:23:38] weak angel you're standing here under
[1:23:40] the ministry of a mighty angel and when
[1:23:43] you see that son of man start speaking
[1:23:45] again in a body you watch that word go
[1:23:48] out and you watch it be manifested
[1:23:50] because the same wind is in that
[1:23:52] preacher is in that body and each
[1:23:55] generation has its own revival and its
[1:23:58] own chance at the word these young
[1:24:00] people have a chance this morning
[1:24:03] there's a lot of people in the message
[1:24:05] that don't want to give these young
[1:24:07] people a chance

[1:24:10] morning this message will tell you you
[1:24:12] got a chance you got your own revival

[1:24:39] satan is doing his absolute worst to
[1:24:41] shut the door and shut the grave and try
[1:24:44] to tell you to stand there but the
[1:24:45] spirit of the living god's telling you

[1:25:24] and second chances

[1:25:30] back home
[1:25:31] reagan
[1:25:32] nine years old
[1:25:34] when we was raised her up
[1:25:36] she was
[1:25:37] a little powerful real spiritual girl
[1:25:40] real powerful little lady
[1:25:42] real sensitive to the move of the holy
[1:25:43] spirit and we were
[1:25:45] we were teaching her on the power of
[1:25:47] prayer
[1:25:48] and we began to
[1:25:49] begin to talk to her and we teach her
[1:25:52] how to pray
[1:25:53] and we were telling her
[1:25:54] now you this is how you you start out
[1:25:56] your prayer this is how you do these
[1:25:57] things and we were telling her to thank
[1:25:59] god for the day

[1:27:58] message just won't be just books and
[1:28:00] tapes it'll be a life
[1:28:08] i heard a little story
[1:28:10] the other day
[1:28:11] like this little boy little billy he
[1:28:14] would mama put him in bed at night time
[1:28:16] she'd take him up there
[1:28:18] she'd take him up there and put him in
[1:28:19] his bed and about midnight she heard
[1:28:21] little billy fall out of his bed
[1:28:23] billy fell out of his bed he just a
[1:28:24] whining and hollering
[1:28:26] mama run upstairs said billy okay
[1:28:29] billy occasion mama i feel like to be
[1:28:32] i felt like to be
[1:28:33] so she put him back in the bed well the
[1:28:35] next night she goes to sleep and all of
[1:28:37] a sudden
[1:28:38] plop
[1:28:39] is that how y'all fall down here
[1:28:40] louisiana could plump
[1:28:43] clip plop is that close okay
[1:28:46] he falls out of the bed again she runs
[1:28:48] billy what's going on
[1:28:50] oh i fell out of bed
[1:28:52] i'm out of bed again
[1:28:55] so she puts him back in the bed same
[1:28:57] thing happened another night she runs
[1:28:59] back up here
[1:29:00] she said billy
[1:29:01] why you keep falling out of bed she said
[1:29:03] mama
[1:29:04] could you fix this
[1:29:06] can you fix this so i don't fall out the

[1:29:10] simple if you'll get far enough in you
[1:29:13] won't fall out
[1:29:15] and if you get far enough into this
[1:29:16] message
[1:29:19] we didn't come here to talk about a
[1:29:21] message we've come to get in the message
[1:29:24] and if you can get in this message and
[1:29:26] get wrapped up tired of tangled up from
[1:29:29] jesus you won't fall out you'll fall in
[1:29:32] love with jesus
[1:29:34] and the enemy will try to tell you and
[1:29:37] lie on you and tell you that you're just
[1:29:39] getting emotional you're not just
[1:29:41] getting emotional it's a real baptism of
[1:29:44] the holy ghost
[1:29:46] the reason why i shout is because
[1:29:48] there's a god of the south on the inside
[1:29:50] of me
[1:29:58] you see when god when jesus was standing
[1:30:01] there
[1:30:02] in john 20 he said peace be unto you as
[1:30:04] my father had sent me even so i sent you
[1:30:07] and when he had said this he breathed on
[1:30:10] them and said on them receive ye the
[1:30:12] holy ghost you see it was a promise that
[1:30:15] he gave them and breathed upon them that
[1:30:18] it was a promise receive you the holy
[1:30:20] ghost it was a promise
[1:30:22] and they went up there in the upper room
[1:30:24] to wait for that promise to be fulfilled
[1:30:28] there's a promise hanging over all over
[1:30:30] all of you today
[1:30:32] it's the same thing when we lay our
[1:30:34] hands on the sick we wait because
[1:30:37] there's a promise laying there that you
[1:30:39] shall recover
[1:30:42] that same wind that came down on the day
[1:30:44] of pentecost is pushing through this
[1:30:47] place it's just not pushing through a
[1:30:49] hippodrome that the prophet was standing
[1:30:51] in and the wind would come through and
[1:30:54] blow his coat tail when the voice of god
[1:30:56] has spoke
[1:30:57] that same unity is in the body right now
[1:31:00] and that same wind it's one to push out
[1:31:03] your sin it's one to set your soul on
[1:31:05] fire it's one to tell you that you've
[1:31:08] got the power on the inside of you to
[1:31:10] get up out of that grave
[1:31:14] i've seen that same wind produce the
[1:31:16] same actions
[1:31:18] that are produced in the early apostles
[1:31:20] i've seen when i lay hands on the sick
[1:31:22] and i watched him recover
[1:31:24] you come too late to tell me that god
[1:31:26] don't heal no more he said why you keep
[1:31:28] preaching that your daddy's gonna get
[1:31:30] healed because god never changed his
[1:31:32] mind about it
[1:31:38] why am i preaching that you can have
[1:31:40] that same pentecostal experience because
[1:31:43] god didn't take his word back
[1:31:45] [Applause]
[1:31:50] i've seen
[1:31:51] little girls that didn't know how to
[1:31:53] walk
[1:31:54] bound in a wheelchair get up out of a
[1:31:56] wheelchair and start walking
[1:31:59] i seen an old man
[1:32:01] whole man come up out of a tent meeting
[1:32:03] and come walking down an aisle just like
[1:32:05] his he was walking with a cane while the
[1:32:07] preaching of the word was going forth
[1:32:09] he'd come walking with that cane he
[1:32:11] could barely get up there but when he
[1:32:13] got up close to where the anointing was
[1:32:15] he dropped the cane and ran back to his
[1:32:18] pew
[1:32:21] if you felt like i felt you'd be
[1:32:23] shouting too
[1:32:28] i've seen a man that was told by the
[1:32:31] highest positions in the land you got
[1:32:33] four months to live and i watched a
[1:32:36] so-called dead man stand behind the
[1:32:38] pulpit and said son of man prophesy
[1:32:42] these bundled bones will live again
[1:32:50] what was it
[1:32:52] what was it it was testifying of an
[1:32:54] empty grave when hattie walter said you
[1:32:56] take me through that prayer line no
[1:32:58] matter what happens if i die you take me
[1:33:01] through that prayer what was it it's
[1:33:03] because she was looking at an empty
[1:33:05] grave
[1:33:06] what was it what was it when georgie
[1:33:09] carter had enough faith to get up out of
[1:33:11] the bed what was it she was looking at
[1:33:13] an empty grave
[1:33:15] what was it when the prophet walked into
[1:33:17] that room where brother elijah had done
[1:33:20] died and he went to comfort the family
[1:33:22] what was he doing it was testify of an
[1:33:25] empty grave when somebody grabbed him a
[1:33:28] hand come and grabbed him and he went
[1:33:30] over there and laid his hands on brother
[1:33:31] elijah had a dumbbell dead and they
[1:33:34] covered him up with a sheet and before
[1:33:36] he knew it he said i was laying on top
[1:33:38] of him and saying brother elijah i
[1:33:40] called for you he went into that spirit
[1:33:43] land what was it prophesied that there
[1:33:45] was an empty grave
[1:33:56] i can't walk that way
[1:33:58] i don't know if i can i don't know if i
[1:33:59] can go that far
[1:34:01] you can go that
[1:34:02] far you can go that far
[1:34:05] you can have that holy ghost you can
[1:34:07] have that deliverance you can have that
[1:34:09] clear mind
[1:34:10] you can have it that's right
[1:34:13] come on
[1:34:16] jesus
[1:34:18] isn't just an option
[1:34:22] jesus ain't even the best option
[1:34:25] he's the only option
[1:34:32] the only option
[1:34:34] for hattie waldrop he was the only
[1:34:36] option for georgie carter he was the
[1:34:39] only option
[1:34:40] for lazarus he was the only option
[1:34:43] are you with me he was the only option
[1:34:45] lazarus had a far more bad condition
[1:34:48] that you got
[1:34:50] he was dead
[1:34:51] some of you may still have this
[1:34:53] condition stinking
[1:34:55] laid up in a grave for four days
[1:34:58] jesus was his only
[1:35:01] option do you think lazarus was looking
[1:35:04] around saying well
[1:35:06] is there a physician that could come and
[1:35:08] put an essential oil on my head that
[1:35:10] make me rise up
[1:35:15] i don't think he put no peppermint on
[1:35:17] him
[1:35:19] he probably
[1:35:20] what else you got spearmint
[1:35:22] peppermint
[1:35:24] digest i don't think digest would have
[1:35:26] worked on lazarus
[1:35:31] help me lord
[1:35:32] but lazarus
[1:35:35] when mary and martha's looking
[1:35:39] if he really loved me
[1:35:40] surely he would have come
[1:35:42] and got him
[1:35:45] but you see
[1:35:47] jesus
[1:35:48] knew
[1:35:49] the power of the grave was getting ready
[1:35:51] to be destroyed
[1:35:53] [Applause]
[1:35:56] you can get out of your condition
[1:35:58] because there is a grave that's already
[1:35:59] destroyed
[1:36:00] [Applause]
[1:36:02] you can get up out of your grave because
[1:36:05] the conditions of life were stripped
[1:36:08] from satan at calvary
[1:36:11] jesus is the only option he's an option
[1:36:14] over addiction he's the option over
[1:36:17] alcohol he's an option he's the option
[1:36:20] he's the option he's the option over
[1:36:22] cancer he's the option
[1:36:27] he's the option over the grave he's an
[1:36:29] option over your deadness he's the
[1:36:31] option over cobit he's the option over
[1:36:34] your fear he's the option
[1:36:36] he's the option
[1:36:43] can you imagine as lazarus
[1:36:45] has done went into another realm
[1:36:48] as he breaks into this realm
[1:36:50] and he goes there
[1:36:52] can you imagine
[1:36:53] as he's breaking into this realm
[1:36:56] and he starts having a conversation with
[1:36:58] abraham
[1:37:00] the one
[1:37:01] the one that you counted on all of your
[1:37:03] life
[1:37:05] the one that spoke to you
[1:37:07] and he told you he told you that
[1:37:09] everything's going to be all right
[1:37:10] you're going to bring forth that son
[1:37:11] that you're going to bring this thing
[1:37:12] you're going to come out of that the one
[1:37:15] that told you
[1:37:18] all of these things are happening
[1:37:20] i was just with him
[1:37:23] i was just with him can you imagine
[1:37:25] lazarus's conversation
[1:37:27] he's the head of the party
[1:37:30] everybody's saying what's going on up
[1:37:32] there
[1:37:33] he's a brother's
[1:37:35] eyes of jacob he gathered them all
[1:37:37] around he grabbed ezekiel grabbed isaiah
[1:37:39] he grabbed him to come here the one that
[1:37:42] you've been looking for that could get
[1:37:43] us out of this grave i'm going to tell
[1:37:45] you something you better get ready the
[1:37:47] lamb has come he's taken away the sin of
[1:37:50] the world he's making his way to calvary
[1:37:52] get ready
[1:37:53] get ready get ready it's time to come
[1:37:56] out and all of a sudden lazarus here's a
[1:37:58] voice calling and he calls him a battle
[1:38:00] that grave it says lazarus come forth
[1:38:03] he's saying to you philip come forth
[1:38:06] andrew come forth
[1:38:09] he's your option he's your option come
[1:38:12] up out of that grave
[1:38:14] and he said loose him and let him go
[1:38:19] woman
[1:38:20] thou
[1:38:22] art
[1:38:23] loosed
[1:38:27] can you imagine
[1:38:29] being locked up in prison
[1:38:31] for something that you didn't do
[1:38:35] you imagine that
[1:38:37] i never robbed a bank
[1:38:39] but i got put in there can you imagine
[1:38:41] being locked away for something that you
[1:38:43] never did
[1:38:44] you imagine what that man would do when
[1:38:46] he got up out of that jail
[1:38:48] he would probably come out probably kiss
[1:38:50] the ground that he was walking in and
[1:38:52] start shouting because he'd come out of
[1:38:54] something that he never did to get
[1:38:56] himself in there
[1:38:58] you can walk out of the grave because
[1:39:01] you didn't deserve to be there
[1:39:12] if he walked out of the grave
[1:39:15] i'm walking too
[1:39:17] oh if he walked out of the grave i'mma
[1:39:20] walk into
[1:39:23] how many is willing
[1:39:25] when the wind starts coming over you
[1:39:27] you recognize i felt that before i've
[1:39:30] handled that before i've seen young
[1:39:32] people get touched by that same wind
[1:39:34] before i can have that
[1:39:37] i can have that i can get out of my dry
[1:39:39] condition i can get out of my sin i can
[1:39:42] get out of it
[1:39:45] and we start here rattling and we start
[1:39:47] hearing a satan because there ain't no
[1:39:50] grave
[1:39:51] gonna hold a body down
[1:39:53] when you've got the same power of the
[1:39:55] son of man living in you
[1:39:57] son of man
[1:39:59] can these bones live again
[1:40:05] i've been quickened i've been made alive
[1:40:07] i know what it's like to be dead but i
[1:40:09] know what it's like to be alive in jesus
[1:40:13] can you imagine them trying to tell
[1:40:15] lazarus you're going back to the grave
[1:40:17] where you came from and they try to
[1:40:19] steer him back into the grave
[1:40:25] you need to be scared lazarus when they
[1:40:27] come back over in john chapter 12 and
[1:40:29] they tried to put him to death because
[1:40:31] of his testimony do you think it scared
[1:40:33] lazarus he just come out of the worst
[1:40:36] conditions that you could ever get out
[1:40:38] of
[1:40:39] and the prophet said he's standing there
[1:40:41] that great goliath trying to scare the
[1:40:42] liver out of you you have done been made
[1:40:45] alive in jesus
[1:40:46] he can't scare you because you who are
[1:40:49] once there in the trespasses of your
[1:40:52] sins you
[1:40:53] hath he quickened
[1:40:58] well come on down here gabriel
[1:41:01] put your foot on atlanta sea but don't
[1:41:04] you blow that trumpet gabriel until you
[1:41:06] hear from me
[1:41:07] [Applause]
[1:41:12] jesus had so much faith
[1:41:15] in the word
[1:41:16] that he trusted his own
[1:41:18] body to go to the grave
[1:41:22] how much more
[1:41:25] how much more can you trust his word
[1:41:28] to get out of sickness
[1:41:32] really
[1:41:33] how much more can you trust him to get
[1:41:35] out of that condition
[1:41:36] if jesus so trusted
[1:41:39] so trusted a backslidden preacher's word
[1:41:42] to get up out of that grave
[1:41:45] how much more can you young people
[1:41:48] every person sitting here how much more
[1:41:50] can you trust him
[1:41:52] he said i am the lord thy god that heals
[1:41:54] all of thy diseases

[1:42:02] thy god that delivers i am the lord thy

[1:42:56] he was the very first one to take an
[1:42:57] airplane ride to heaven
[1:43:00] and i heard the prophet when i heard him
[1:43:02] speaking over there trying to do god a
[1:43:04] service without being his will and he
[1:43:06] comes all the way down to the end of
[1:43:08] that service he said i watched as elijah
[1:43:11] stepped up into that chariot and he took
[1:43:14] him and this rope fell back down to
[1:43:16] elisha
[1:43:17] and he said one of these days he's going
[1:43:20] to unhook the horses from the bushes and
[1:43:23] he's going to take that body

[1:43:30] break a day that angel came from heaven
[1:43:32] and he rolled that stone away you could
[1:43:34] take me to the graveyard and lay his
[1:43:37] whole body down but on resurrection

[2:02:46] her homeland is ezekiel 37 had
[2:02:49] prophesied and a nation that had
[2:02:53] languished and death and died and was in
[2:02:55] the graves has now risen again and
[2:02:58] become a great and mighty nation that we
[2:03:01] know is the land of israel but you
[2:03:04] remember they're only a type of exactly

[2:03:23] here as those that have to have taken on
[2:03:26] life and i'm glad that um today that our
[2:03:31] what we look like isn't just some dead
[2:03:33] corpse as brother branham even saw he

[2:03:39] mentioned nazarene in particular there
[2:03:42] in the in one vision he said kissing on
[2:03:44] the dead corpse but let me tell you

[2:03:59] of acts

[2:04:02] resurrection out of dark
[2:04:04] denominationalism back to the word again

[2:04:49] predestined to be here in this hour in
[2:04:51] this time
[2:04:52] amen and i we are we're here at a very
[2:04:55] special moment here for the church here
[2:04:57] at evening light tabernacle there is um
[2:05:01] you know something that we had
[2:05:04] desired to be able to do
[2:05:07] for the people of god here in this area
[2:05:10] and our hearts always been for our young
[2:05:13] people it's never been my vision at all
[2:05:16] that you know you that you build um a
[2:05:19] exercise and game
[2:05:22] events and things like that
[2:05:24] to attract young people to the church or
[2:05:26] to keep them in the church that's never
[2:05:28] been a part of what we believe here we
[2:05:30] believe in an old-fashioned baptism of
[2:05:33] the holy ghost
[2:05:34] god getting a hold of their hearts
[2:05:37] changing their lives
[2:05:38] transforming them by the power of god
[2:05:42] amen there's nothing else
[2:05:44] all the gems and the exercise programs
[2:05:47] will never keep young people it's the
[2:05:49] keeping power of the blood
[2:05:51] and we believe that and we preach that
[2:05:53] and we expect god to come on the scene
[2:05:56] and feel with the holy ghost for the
[2:05:58] promises unto us to our children to them
[2:06:01] that are far off even as many as the
[2:06:04] lord our god shall call
[2:06:06] and this is what we believe that god is
[2:06:08] still calling god is still moving and
[2:06:11] god is still doing great things
[2:06:14] it was some um time ago that um
[2:06:18] i was um
[2:06:20] there
[2:06:21] in a
[2:06:22] in a a situation where we had one of our
[2:06:25] elders brother gary steinke who was um
[2:06:28] in the hospital and he was dying
[2:06:32] and um
[2:06:34] and and in this condition he had not
[2:06:37] been able to eat uh having a blockage in
[2:06:40] his bowels and
[2:06:41] diverticuli had
[2:06:43] had sealed it off or that there could be
[2:06:46] no
[2:06:47] digestion of food and then after
[2:06:50] removing a part of his colon then they
[2:06:53] put a little bag on the side but the
[2:06:55] stomach would not restart and he could
[2:06:58] not uh eat or keep anything down and so
[2:07:02] it would uh they were trying to feed him
[2:07:04] but they would just have to pump it
[2:07:06] right back out again because his stomach
[2:07:08] would not digest he was in a dying
[2:07:11] condition
[2:07:12] and in this dying condition this man has
[2:07:15] been a stalwart son of god a real child
[2:07:18] of god
[2:07:19] someone that um all we could all aspire
[2:07:22] to be like his brother gary steinke
[2:07:24] they're wonderful people that love god
[2:07:27] and serve the lord and have done that
[2:07:29] diligently
[2:07:31] since they were young people when they
[2:07:33] embraced the message of the hour and
[2:07:36] and um you know brother brother gary
[2:07:38] though began to have
[2:07:40] um uh
[2:07:41] tormenting spirits that was coming into
[2:07:44] his room
[2:07:45] and they were howling at him and telling
[2:07:48] him that you know that they were going
[2:07:50] to take his life they were going to ruin
[2:07:52] him and and and destroy him they caused
[2:07:56] they were just howling at him in his in
[2:07:59] his room till he was he became afraid to
[2:08:03] be able to even be alone
[2:08:05] in in the hospital room and um you know
[2:08:09] when i heard about it it made me really
[2:08:11] really angry
[2:08:13] and and i i just said you know this is
[2:08:15] not gonna happen on my watch
[2:08:18] you know as a shepherd i've got an
[2:08:20] authority there to go and cast out
[2:08:23] devils we saw something cast out last
[2:08:25] night we're a church that believes in
[2:08:28] casting out devils
[2:08:30] amen we believe that not only will
[2:08:32] spirits obey us
[2:08:34] of demons and demon powers but sin
[2:08:37] and sin disease has got to flee
[2:08:40] and that's called conversion
[2:08:43] amen we we have a whole altar here
[2:08:45] because we believe in an altar we
[2:08:48] believe in an experience with god we
[2:08:50] believe in a dying out to sin
[2:08:53] and um but anyway with brother gary in
[2:08:56] his uh dying condition there
[2:08:58] i i i decided i'm going to go to his
[2:09:02] hotel to his um his place
[2:09:05] where he's at in his room in the in the
[2:09:07] hospital and i'm going to confront the
[2:09:10] demons that have been tormenting him i
[2:09:12] said it's not going to happen he's 70
[2:09:14] plus years older i've been if it was
[2:09:17] god's time to take him well he could
[2:09:20] take him that's fine but no devil was
[2:09:22] going to torment him
[2:09:24] he didn't have a right to we're children
[2:09:26] of god i believe that
[2:09:29] i don't believe we have a that the devil
[2:09:31] has a right to us to torment our lives
[2:09:34] and not with sickness not with disease
[2:09:37] not with sin not with habits not with
[2:09:39] anything
[2:09:40] the devil has no right to us
[2:09:42] we're the children of the most high god
[2:09:45] and we have a divine heritage
[2:09:49] and we have a commission
[2:09:51] to cast him out
[2:09:53] we don't have to live with devils
[2:09:55] amen we can rise up above it as brother
[2:09:58] andrew preach there's no grave you name
[2:10:01] it that can hold us down we're the
[2:10:04] children of the most high god
[2:10:06] amen and and there as i went to his room
[2:10:10] to pray with him i
[2:10:12] i text brother timothy and told him i
[2:10:15] said pray with me i'm going to go into
[2:10:17] this hospital room to pray with brother
[2:10:19] gary and he wrote me back he said dad
[2:10:22] remember we are writing the book of acts
[2:10:25] and i walked in there with a purpose
[2:10:28] i walked in there with a purpose
[2:10:30] and as i went into that hospital room my
[2:10:34] wife and i
[2:10:35] he was so low that i couldn't hear what
[2:10:38] he said so i drew up a chair beside his
[2:10:41] bed and i began to talk to him and he
[2:10:44] began to talk to me and it was so low
[2:10:46] i'd have to hold my uh voice so low i'd
[2:10:49] have to hold my ear down to near him so
[2:10:52] i could catch what he was saying and as
[2:10:56] he did he shared with me
[2:11:00] the desires that he had in his heart and
[2:11:03] some of them was for his family and and
[2:11:05] accommodations that was needed and
[2:11:08] situations you know for those who
[2:11:10] come from far off and and different
[2:11:13] things and and so you know they as he as
[2:11:17] he shared with me the very these very
[2:11:19] things there
[2:11:21] the holy spirit
[2:11:22] um fell down
[2:11:24] in the room and and god gave me the
[2:11:28] gave me the unction to
[2:11:31] address the demons that was troubling
[2:11:33] him and i rebuked them and commanded
[2:11:36] them to leave him by that evening he was
[2:11:38] eating jell-o and he was back on his
[2:11:40] road to health and a few months they
[2:11:43] reattached his colon and and so on like
[2:11:46] that until he was a well man again
[2:11:49] this is the god we
[2:11:50] serve amen this is the god we serve
[2:11:55] ain't no grave
[2:11:57] gonna take us prematurely
[2:12:01] amen the grave has no power over us we
[2:12:04] have power over death hell and the grave
[2:12:09] amen this is this is the promise that as
[2:12:11] god has given
[2:12:13] anyway as i
[2:12:15] left from there i realized that god had
[2:12:18] given me a mandate now i was 60 years
[2:12:21] old we had a church we had the
[2:12:23] fellowship hall we had
[2:12:25] um other buildings there
[2:12:28] administration building we had a place
[2:12:30] out in the country as far as i was
[2:12:32] concerned we you know i i had no ego
[2:12:35] destroy to stroke i had no desire as far
[2:12:39] as you know i just thought this would be
[2:12:42] would serve us till the lord came but
[2:12:45] looking around i realized that the
[2:12:47] things that he had asked me to do and
[2:12:49] the lord had blessed in this
[2:12:51] conversation and it confirmed it
[2:12:54] that we
[2:12:56] we were landlocked and we were unable to
[2:12:59] accomplish those things in that location
[2:13:02] and um so
[2:13:05] we looked around and the parking lot was
[2:13:07] full and the church
[2:13:09] we it was the sanctuary was getting
[2:13:12] where we were out growing it the
[2:13:15] uh where the children had a church and
[2:13:18] sunday school they were out of room and
[2:13:20] the fellowship hall was too small and
[2:13:23] and um just realizing that
[2:13:25] you know that we got to tarry till he
[2:13:27] comes
[2:13:29] and that i i don't want to be a man
[2:13:32] that's just found with a bunch of money
[2:13:33] in my pocket and i didn't use it for the
[2:13:35] things of god
[2:13:37] and so you know we we started there
[2:13:40] looking and we
[2:13:42] um you know eventually after trying
[2:13:45] different things
[2:13:47] on august uh
[2:13:48] uh the eighth in 2014 now
[2:13:52] nearly seven years ago we purchased this
[2:13:54] acreage here
[2:13:56] and um
[2:13:57] you know
[2:13:58] and we
[2:13:59] and i first thought we'd just build a
[2:14:01] pavilion
[2:14:02] and we would start there and maybe we
[2:14:04] could put some camper spots around it
[2:14:06] and we'd still stay where we're at but
[2:14:08] because we were out of room everywhere
[2:14:11] and there was needs and we we needed to
[2:14:14] we needed a better way to for the
[2:14:17] internet to be able to reach the uh the
[2:14:20] outlying areas around us
[2:14:22] and also to be a witness around the
[2:14:25] world some people wonder why do you have
[2:14:27] your services online well i'll tell you
[2:14:30] you know it's um it's just like this
[2:14:33] there was a little lady over in in
[2:14:35] england
[2:14:36] that she was down praying and as she was
[2:14:39] praying she the the prophecy came and it
[2:14:43] said deep color to the deep and she said
[2:14:47] well i don't understand that i think
[2:14:49] that's in the bible so she went and
[2:14:52] found the verse in the bible and then
[2:14:54] after finding it in the bible she still
[2:14:56] said well there's something about this
[2:14:59] that god's trying to tell us so she she
[2:15:02] got on the computer and she went to and
[2:15:05] and and put in the words deep color to
[2:15:08] the deep it brought her to the man
[2:15:10] william branham which took her to
[2:15:12] brother biskell's um uh website and
[2:15:15] there i was preaching
[2:15:18] and as i was preaching there you know
[2:15:21] the you know there um as i left from
[2:15:24] there she followed us right over to
[2:15:26] eveninglight.net and began to listen to
[2:15:29] all of the services would even be up in
[2:15:32] three and four o'clock in the morning
[2:15:34] when our services was off time with
[2:15:36] england and and would listen to the
[2:15:39] services you know god's got his way of
[2:15:41] reaching the predestinated sea
[2:15:44] around the world
[2:15:46] amen so god knows how to do it and there
[2:15:49] have been many lives that have been
[2:15:51] touched because of it and that's only
[2:15:53] one of the testimonies that we could
[2:15:54] give but many many hundreds of lives
[2:15:57] that have been touched as the gospel
[2:15:59] must be preached around the world and
[2:16:02] then shall the end come
[2:16:04] but anyway we we went through the times
[2:16:08] of
[2:16:09] uh where that we we laid the the
[2:16:11] foundations and we built this building
[2:16:15] and uh you know sometimes people have
[2:16:17] criticized me for
[2:16:19] um extravagance and said well this is
[2:16:22] just um too much it reminds me of judas
[2:16:26] you know who wanted to
[2:16:27] who was angry because he anointed jesus
[2:16:30] with this expensive oil and said it
[2:16:32] should have been sold and given to the
[2:16:33] poor
[2:16:34] and my reply is you know yeah i
[2:16:38] understand there are those who have not
[2:16:41] and those that are not blessed in in in
[2:16:44] the way that we are
[2:16:46] and you know if you're really really
[2:16:48] concerned about it just go sell your
[2:16:50] nice house and give it to them
[2:16:55] but you want to continue living in a
[2:16:56] nice house and driving a nice car then
[2:16:59] don't complain about my church
[2:17:02] but either way regardless of whether you
[2:17:04] complain or not i'm going to do what god
[2:17:06] called me to do anyhow
[2:17:17] now
[2:17:18] now you know we we are come now to this
[2:17:21] point and this is where that we're
[2:17:23] coming to
[2:17:24] and i want to share this scripture with
[2:17:26] you
[2:17:27] from psalm 68 11
[2:17:29] the lord gave the word
[2:17:32] great was the company of those that
[2:17:35] published it
[2:17:37] now
[2:17:38] after we have been into this building
[2:17:41] now as we took about three years to
[2:17:43] build it and everything that you see on
[2:17:45] this property the property the the
[2:17:48] church the parking lot the the the new
[2:17:51] building that we're fixing to dedicate
[2:17:54] everything that we have god gave it to
[2:17:57] us debt free we don't owe a dime on it
[2:18:02] never have and never will
[2:18:12] and i want to say that this is an
[2:18:14] amazing accomplishment of god working
[2:18:16] through his people
[2:18:18] certainly god has wrought wonders
[2:18:21] although
[2:18:22] he used his people who caught a vision
[2:18:26] to achieve it
[2:18:28] and i'm delighted that god has
[2:18:30] surrounded me with
[2:18:32] capable men and women who allows god to
[2:18:35] use them
[2:18:37] and while his people have certainly lent
[2:18:40] to god their talents and their hands
[2:18:43] it was god who gave the direction and
[2:18:45] the strength and made the provisions
[2:18:49] and when i think about how this uh you
[2:18:51] know how all this began i'm stunned
[2:18:54] and amazed
[2:18:56] and i can never drive up to this place
[2:18:58] without just thanking god for what he's
[2:19:00] done
[2:19:01] it's a miracle
[2:19:02] all every every step of the way the
[2:19:05] miraculous hands of god you know if you
[2:19:08] if you're wondering whether god's still
[2:19:10] a god of miracles just look right here
[2:19:12] at evening like tabernacle we can start
[2:19:15] with one miracle after miracle after
[2:19:17] miracle this church is founded on
[2:19:21] miracles that gods did and he continues
[2:19:24] to do
[2:19:25] as a sick or healed as as the lost or
[2:19:29] saved as those that have been in drugs
[2:19:31] and and and horrible situation drunkards
[2:19:35] or whatever are delivered in the name of
[2:19:37] jesus christ miracles continue to happen
[2:19:41] because jesus christ is the same
[2:19:43] yesterday today and forever
[2:19:46] now
[2:19:47] surely we can see it all began because
[2:19:51] the lord gave the word there in the
[2:19:53] hospital room
[2:19:54] where the doctors had done their best
[2:19:57] using their skillful knowledge and their
[2:20:00] talents that was given by god
[2:20:03] and yet with all the knowledge with all
[2:20:05] the skills and abilities of mankind when
[2:20:09] all of that had been spent
[2:20:11] and gary steinke was laying there dying
[2:20:14] and they were trying to keep him alive
[2:20:16] he still was in a dying condition till
[2:20:20] jesus came
[2:20:22] and the day jesus walked into that room
[2:20:24] and i'll be honest i had been in the
[2:20:26] room before i had prayed prayers for him
[2:20:29] before i'd asked god to heal him before
[2:20:32] i had prayed many prayers for him
[2:20:34] already in these 21 days but that day
[2:20:38] jesus came in
[2:20:40] and when jesus came in
[2:20:42] that day and the spirit of god dropped
[2:20:44] down
[2:20:45] there was a healing that began
[2:20:48] and the deliverance that had been did
[2:20:49] that took place
[2:20:51] and and what what he had what he said to
[2:20:54] me that day must have pleased the lord
[2:20:57] as the holy spirit dropped down in that
[2:20:59] room and and i cursed those demons that
[2:21:02] were taken as life and in the spirit we
[2:21:05] were able to reach down into realms that
[2:21:09] doctors could not reach
[2:21:12] and
[2:21:13] and so
[2:21:14] as
[2:21:15] by evening that day as i said he was
[2:21:18] starting to eat jello and and from there
[2:21:21] went right on back to the road of health
[2:21:23] and
[2:21:23] and you know as i considered what
[2:21:26] pleased the lord
[2:21:28] i realized i had a commission to carry
[2:21:30] out
[2:21:31] and as as i said my my first thoughts
[2:21:34] was to build a pavilion
[2:21:36] and that we would provide that with you
[2:21:39] know an area and maybe set up some
[2:21:42] camping spots or different things and
[2:21:44] you know some error some ways to make
[2:21:46] accommodation for for the people
[2:21:50] and
[2:21:51] you know i then i realized we had a
[2:21:53] greater need
[2:21:55] we had a need of getting an area where
[2:21:57] we could
[2:21:58] where we could be a lighthouse that the
[2:22:01] evening light would come out from under
[2:22:03] the bushel
[2:22:04] out of the woods
[2:22:06] i had a vision and to understand that
[2:22:08] god had given me a commission
[2:22:11] he put the money in my hands
[2:22:13] and we we used it for his glory and we
[2:22:17] paid for this building and completed it
[2:22:20] and then
[2:22:21] a couple of years ago
[2:22:23] we started again
[2:22:25] and that was
[2:22:26] to build this pavilion that we started
[2:22:29] out to build
[2:22:30] now
[2:22:31] our trustees are are practical people
[2:22:35] we have men in this church like brother
[2:22:37] james mitchell that
[2:22:39] you know he
[2:22:40] he has a vision when we do something
[2:22:44] don't do it halfway do it right
[2:22:46] and so when he looked at this thoughts
[2:22:49] of the pavilion he said
[2:22:51] you know why have an open
[2:22:53] i have it all open why can't we use this
[2:22:56] and fix it where we can use it year
[2:22:58] round so we put sides on it
[2:23:01] it's air conditioned heated where we can
[2:23:03] use it 365 days out of the year where
[2:23:06] it's comfortable all the time
[2:23:08] we did this because we
[2:23:11] we realized that investing in our young
[2:23:14] people is investing
[2:23:16] in god's future and as long as we're
[2:23:18] here we have a future
[2:23:20] and when we step from beyond there we
[2:23:22] got a greater future
[2:23:24] in the eternities
[2:23:26] and so as we did we we built this
[2:23:30] pavilion and just this day by the
[2:23:33] miraculous hands of god and him working
[2:23:36] through his people
[2:23:38] we have been able to get the fire
[2:23:41] marshal approval and the opening up of a
[2:23:43] new facility here at evening light
[2:23:45] tabernacle
[2:23:46] a pavilion that we have made
[2:23:48] as i was on the grand jury here some
[2:23:51] um i think it was year before last
[2:23:55] and i in my rural parish that i live in
[2:23:58] we call them parishes here's their
[2:23:59] counties in the rural county where i
[2:24:02] live
[2:24:02] there was um
[2:24:04] a um
[2:24:06] a woman
[2:24:07] that was um claimed to be a recruiter
[2:24:10] for colleges and so on and she was
[2:24:13] taking young young men and and and
[2:24:16] taking them and introducing them to
[2:24:19] pornography and giving pictures of
[2:24:21] herself and doing sex acts and and and
[2:24:24] uh taking
[2:24:26] delight and taking their virginity that
[2:24:28] was right here in our parish
[2:24:31] right in a local and you know in rural
[2:24:33] louisiana
[2:24:35] and i realized that you know we need a
[2:24:38] safe place
[2:24:40] for our young people whether they're not
[2:24:42] pushed out into among the wolves
[2:24:45] in in in some of the the areas where
[2:24:48] that they had been doing things uh like
[2:24:51] um meeting together and and in playing
[2:24:54] ball and and basketball or whatever they
[2:24:57] was doing
[2:24:58] there in the
[2:25:00] in in the town of menden i realized we
[2:25:02] needed a more safer environment for our
[2:25:05] young people and that our young people
[2:25:07] were worth invested in and so because of
[2:25:11] that we have
[2:25:13] finished this project we are going to
[2:25:16] dedicate it today
[2:25:18] and um when
[2:25:20] i'm going to be dismissing you in a
[2:25:22] moment and i'd like you to walk out with
[2:25:24] us

[2:25:31] we will ask god's blessings upon the
[2:25:34] the fruit of our hands and where we have
