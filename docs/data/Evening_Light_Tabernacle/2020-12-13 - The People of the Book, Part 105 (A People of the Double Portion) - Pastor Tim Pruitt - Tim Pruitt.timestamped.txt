[45:06] sometimes you go through things like job
[45:08] did
[45:11] and it's never without a purpose
[45:14] or other words otherwise god would be
[45:17] the
[45:18] author of confusion and frustration
[45:21] but god's got a purpose he's got a plan
[45:26] and when it was all over with job had a
[45:29] deeper revelation of god than ever
[45:32] he could say i know
[45:35] because he looked ahead in time and
[45:39] and could see all the way to the
[45:41] redeemer coming and saying
[45:43] i know my redeemer liveth for the last
[45:45] days he'll stand upon the earth
[45:48] and though these skin worms would
[45:50] destroy my body yet in my flesh i'll see
[45:52] god
[45:53] who i will see for myself and not
[45:55] another
[45:57] you see that's the way it is
[46:00] every time that we have a troubled
[46:02] situation comes
[46:04] it is for the purpose of giving us a
[46:07] deeper revelation of god may god reveal
[46:11] himself to you today in a deeper way
[46:14] amen until turn every trial into a
[46:16] blessing that's
[46:18] he said all things work together for the
[46:21] good of them that love
[46:22] god to know that god is doing that
[46:26] he's working all things for your good
[46:30] he's got a purpose a plan for your life
[46:34] just walk in that plan amen
[46:43] we're blessed people today i'm looking
[46:46] across this congregation and we're able
[46:48] to worship together
[46:50] just about all almost unhindered today
[46:53] [Music]
[46:54] unfettered um
[46:56] [Music]
[46:57] i got a a a a text from
[47:01] a brother um stephen francis in
[47:05] south africa today and he said pray for
[47:08] us
[47:09] more restrictions or may be coming upon
[47:12] us that will keep us from worshiping and
[47:15] having church and i thought oh god
[47:18] how blessed we are to be able to
[47:21] assemble like we are
[47:22] this today and worship the lord together
[47:27] you know satan knew that we're here in
[47:30] the end time he knows his time is short
[47:33] so right here in the middle of this he
[47:35] sends one of these diseases to the
[47:37] country
[47:39] because he knows that we are to assemble
[47:42] even so much the more as we see
[47:46] that day approaching we're not to
[47:48] assemble less but
[47:50] more as we see that day approaching
[47:54] and so because of that the enemy comes
[47:57] in to try to hinder
[47:59] but you know when the spirit of god
[48:01] raises up the standard
[48:03] [Music]
[48:04] amen and i believe you're that standard
[48:06] that god's raising up in this last day
[48:09] amen against the enemy may speak today
[48:13] to the hearts and lives of each person
[48:15] jesus knows what your need is
[48:18] he's able to supply it we heard the song
[48:21] song there's a miracle
[48:23] in the working for you today do you feel
[48:26] the spirit of god come down
[48:27] as we heard that saying today the
[48:29] anointing just come down to confirm that
[48:33] that's because there's a miracle for you
[48:36] no matter where you are no matter how
[48:38] steeped in sin no matter how much
[48:40] trouble
[48:41] amen there's a miracle to turn that life
[48:43] around
[48:44] to move in your life to deal with your
[48:48] situation
[48:50] so expect him today to move on your
[48:52] behalf
[48:54] amen now let's just talk to the lord
[48:56] together
[48:58] father we love you and we thank you for
[49:01] your blessings to us
[49:03] the joy that we have of serving you the
[49:06] privilege that we have
[49:07] of coming together lord we thank you for
[49:10] each one that is here
[49:13] lord we ask for those that are not here
[49:16] that you'd be merciful to them
[49:18] that your holy spirit the angel of god
[49:21] the angel of your presence would just go
[49:23] right down to the rooms the houses
[49:27] where your believers are gathered that
[49:29] are not able to assemble together some
[49:31] are sick in their bodies some
[49:32] approaching
[49:33] surgery other situations are coming
[49:36] but may they know there's a miracle for
[49:38] them today
[49:40] that there's a healer there's a healer
[49:43] for he was wounded for our
[49:45] transgressions
[49:48] by those traps we were healed
[49:52] when you walked among the shores of
[49:54] galilee
[49:56] you healed all that were sick and you
[49:58] showed us your will
[49:59] concerning all that there is all in the
[50:01] atonement

[50:19] sin so they can be recipients

[50:36] in jesus name
[50:37] amen amen god bless you
[50:41] we're going to turn to john chapter 14.
[50:45] very familiar scripture really but one
[50:48] we want to speak on this morning that's
[50:50] upon our hearts to
[50:52] minister on john 14 and verse
[50:55] 12 amen it's so good to be in the house
[50:59] of the lord today and
[51:01] be able to worship together with you
[51:04] believing that he will minister to you
[51:06] in a very special way
[51:08] amen john 14 12 verily verily
[51:12] i say unto you that he that believeth on
[51:15] me
[51:16] the works that i do shall he do also
[51:19] and greater works than thee shall he do
[51:21] because i go into my father
[51:24] and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
[51:28] that will i do that the father may be
[51:30] glorified in the son
[51:32] if you ask anything in my name
[51:36] i will do it
[51:39] amen thank god for his unfailing words
[51:43] a promise second kings chapter 2 verse 9
[51:47] will be our second reading today
[51:50] 2 kings chapter 2 verse 9
[51:54] it would do well maybe to have read even
[51:57] more this chapter but we'll read this
[52:00] portion and it came to pass
[52:03] when they were gone over that elijah
[52:05] said unto elisha
[52:07] ask what i shall do for thee before
[52:10] i be taken away from thee and elisha
[52:12] said
[52:13] i pray thee let a double portion of thy
[52:17] spirit be upon me
[52:19] and he said thou hast asked a hard thing
[52:23] nevertheless if thou see me when i am
[52:26] taken from thee
[52:27] it shall be so unto thee but if not
[52:30] it shall not be so and it came to pass
[52:34] as they still went on and talked that
[52:37] that behold there appeared a chariot of
[52:39] fire and horses of fire and parted them
[52:42] both asunder and elijah went up by a
[52:46] whirlwind
[52:47] into heaven and elijah saw it and he
[52:50] cried
[52:51] my father my father the chariot of
[52:53] israel
[52:54] and the horsemen thereof and he saw him
[52:56] no more
[52:57] and he took hold of his own clothes and
[53:00] rent them in two pieces he took also
[53:04] up also the mantle of elijah
[53:08] that fell from him and went back and
[53:10] stood by the
[53:11] bank of jordan and took the mantle of
[53:15] elijah that fell
[53:17] from him and smote the waters and said
[53:19] where is the god
[53:21] of elijah and when he had smitten the
[53:24] waters
[53:25] they parted hither and thither and
[53:27] elisha
[53:28] went over and when the sons of the
[53:31] prophets
[53:32] which were to view at jericho saw him
[53:36] they said the spirit of elijah doth rest
[53:39] on elijah and they came to meet him and
[53:43] bowed themselves
[53:44] to the ground before him amen god bless
[53:48] you
[53:48] you can have your seats
[53:51] there is this type of elijah and elisha
[53:55] and me
[53:56] we're going to be speaking about that
[53:58] this morning
[54:00] as we speak of a people of a double
[54:04] portion
[54:05] this is going to be our title for today
[54:07] a people of a double portion
[54:10] it's always good to look in the promises
[54:12] of the word because
[54:14] it positions us in our place it helps us
[54:17] to know
[54:18] where we are in the word of god and what
[54:20] the word spoke about
[54:22] us in this last day and this
[54:25] great type of elijah and elijah
[54:29] if it's correctly placed is concerning
[54:32] jesus and his bride because she is to
[54:36] continue
[54:37] his ministry and you can see here
[54:40] in this very story that there was elijah
[54:43] that was going to be taken up in a
[54:45] whirlwind
[54:46] and yet the continuation of his ministry
[54:50] in in elisha and then we see again you
[54:53] know
[54:54] in um the same thing with um
[54:57] with jesus that his ministry is to
[55:00] continue
[55:01] upon the earth now in a prophecy
[55:04] concerning the bride
[55:06] the holy spirit put up on brother
[55:07] branham's pen some things to write
[55:10] and these are prophecies that are spoken
[55:12] about in this last day
[55:15] that someone must fulfill how many
[55:17] believes that you're in the fulfillment
[55:19] of prophecy
[55:20] so as he said that those in the bride do
[55:23] only his will
[55:24] no one can make them do otherwise
[55:28] they have thus saith the lord or they
[55:30] keep still
[55:31] and they know that it has to be god in
[55:34] them
[55:34] doing the works fulfilling his own word
[55:38] he did not complete all his work
[55:41] while in his earthly ministry so now he
[55:44] works in
[55:45] and through his bride she knows that
[55:49] for it was not yet time for him to do
[55:51] certain things that he must do now
[55:53] but he will now he will now fulfill
[55:56] through the bride
[55:57] that work that which he left for this
[55:59] specific
[56:00] time and remember there's always a word
[56:04] to be fulfilled and we have a purpose
[56:06] here in this last day
[56:08] in fulfilling the promises now in all
[56:11] truthfulness
[56:13] we know that there is an elijah for our
[56:15] day malachi 4
[56:17] said that very clearly that before the
[56:19] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[56:20] the lord
[56:21] that he would send unto us elijah the
[56:24] prophet
[56:25] and it would be that an elijah anointing
[56:29] upon a man that would turn
[56:30] the hearts of the children back to the
[56:33] faith of the fathers in other words
[56:34] bring
[56:35] a restoration and and so
[56:39] as we know there is an elijah for our
[56:41] day
[56:42] but that type does not include another
[56:46] to take his prophetic anointing
[56:50] now there is no elisha ministry to
[56:53] follow
[56:53] this great prophet in this last day
[56:56] which we know is william branham
[56:58] there there's no elisha ministry to
[57:00] follow him he was the seventh angel
[57:03] and there's not another to follow him
[57:05] there is not
[57:06] another gentile prophet there's not an
[57:09] apostle
[57:10] or uh or another who will follow this
[57:13] messenger an eighth messenger he is the
[57:16] last to the gentiles and next elijah
[57:18] will be to the jews and we are in the
[57:22] bright age but it is not an age separate
[57:24] from the seventh angel
[57:26] and his message however the type of the
[57:29] double portion
[57:31] certainly applies when it comes to jesus
[57:35] amen and what a greater one to receive a
[57:37] double portion from
[57:40] amen and and because he said the works
[57:43] that i do
[57:45] shall you do also and greater than these
[57:48] shall you do
[57:49] now this promise was not all given to
[57:51] brother branham only
[57:53] although it included him but we and we
[57:56] saw the ministry of christ
[57:58] manifested through him but it was not
[58:00] exclusive to him
[58:02] you see is a promise given to the entire
[58:06] church who believes on him how many is a
[58:09] believer
[58:10] amen so the whole ones that believe john
[58:13] 14
[58:14] 12 is applicable to every believer
[58:17] let's read it again john 14 12 verily
[58:20] verily it's
[58:21] when jesus makes uh an emphasis it's
[58:24] it's like an oath it's like um a
[58:27] double confirmation you know he is
[58:30] saying
[58:31] verily verily i say unto you he's
[58:33] placing
[58:34] emphasis on something that he wants you
[58:37] to
[58:37] get he said i say to you he that
[58:40] believeth on me the works
[58:42] that i do shall he do also
[58:46] and greater works than thee shall he do
[58:48] because i go
[58:50] to my father and whatsoever you shall
[58:53] ask in
[58:53] my name that will i do for the father
[58:56] that the father may be glorified in the
[58:59] son
[58:59] if you ask anything say anything
[59:03] anything in my name i will
[59:06] do it now of course
[59:09] when when leaving jesus said these words
[59:12] you know the works that i do if you'll
[59:14] notice this place right in john 14 as
[59:17] as jesus begins to um even in
[59:21] chapter 17 begins to pray over his
[59:23] disciples and
[59:24] and say his parting words before the
[59:27] crucifixion and this is part
[59:29] of those very things because um he will
[59:32] he will say in in the early part of this
[59:36] chapter
[59:37] you know again that i'm going to go away
[59:40] and if i go away
[59:41] i will come again to receive you to
[59:43] myself and
[59:44] i won't leave you comfortless but i will
[59:46] come to you you see he was
[59:48] giving all of these parting words and as
[59:51] he
[59:51] gave these parting words he said greater
[59:54] works
[59:55] than that i have done you will do
[59:58] and and of course the word greater we
[1:00:01] know means more
[1:00:02] because you didn't couldn't do greater
[1:00:04] in quality but just in
[1:00:05] quantity because he was there in one
[1:00:08] person
[1:00:10] but god represented in one man the
[1:00:12] fullness of the godhead
[1:00:14] in one body the man christ jesus
[1:00:17] but now today he is represented in the
[1:00:21] universal
[1:00:22] church worldwide everywhere
[1:00:25] so you see more than this shall you do
[1:00:28] because
[1:00:29] it wouldn't just be one doing the works
[1:00:31] of christ but it would be
[1:00:32] multitudes doing the works of christ
[1:00:36] and so he says the world will see me no
[1:00:39] more but
[1:00:40] you will see me i'll be with you even in
[1:00:42] you to the end of the world
[1:00:44] now these are promises that are left to
[1:00:47] us
[1:00:48] that we must hold on to with all our
[1:00:51] hearts today
[1:00:52] i just shared this from the five
[1:00:54] identifications of the true church
[1:00:57] he quotes john portion of john 14 12 and
[1:01:00] he said
[1:01:00] he gives a teaching of what the church
[1:01:03] should do
[1:01:04] verily verily i say to you he that
[1:01:05] believeth on me the works that i do
[1:01:08] shall he do also and greater works than
[1:01:11] these shall he do
[1:01:12] because i go to my father
[1:01:15] that's the message of the church
[1:01:19] about jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:01:21] today and forever
[1:01:23] living in the church king of the church
[1:01:25] raised from the dead same yesterday
[1:01:27] today and forever
[1:01:28] performing the same works doing the same
[1:01:30] things jesus
[1:01:31] did that is the message of the church
[1:01:35] if the church isn't teaching that it's
[1:01:38] teaching
[1:01:39] some false theology that's what jesus
[1:01:42] commanded them to preach
[1:01:45] so now notice this is our message our
[1:01:48] message is
[1:01:50] john 14 12 the works that jesus did
[1:01:54] shall you do also and greater than these
[1:01:57] shall you do you see it is what
[1:02:00] has been commanded to be our messages
[1:02:03] our instructions
[1:02:05] that he left as he was as he was
[1:02:08] departing from the earth
[1:02:09] he would leave these instructions to the
[1:02:12] church
[1:02:13] the works that i do shall you do also
[1:02:16] of these signs shall follow them that
[1:02:19] believe
[1:02:20] mark 16 some more of his parting words
[1:02:23] according to mark
[1:02:24] you see again these works
[1:02:27] would be done you know if you look in
[1:02:30] the greek it's
[1:02:31] more shall you do because why god was
[1:02:34] just in one man but
[1:02:35] now he's in his whole church
[1:02:38] you see he god was in one man then
[1:02:41] all men who believe him now more than
[1:02:44] this shall you do for i
[1:02:45] go to my father i'll turn back to the
[1:02:47] light that i was and i led the children
[1:02:50] of israel through the wilderness
[1:02:51] i'll turn back to that and in a little
[1:02:54] while i'll come again
[1:02:55] john 14 12 the works that i do shall you
[1:02:58] do also
[1:02:58] and now he said and more than this
[1:03:04] now in this day an indictment
[1:03:07] was brought against the unbelieving
[1:03:10] generation
[1:03:12] for the purpose of killing the effect
[1:03:15] of the world and this is how they
[1:03:18] crucify christ
[1:03:20] and put him to an open shame and i just
[1:03:22] want to say
[1:03:23] it is a shame to let the sick lay
[1:03:26] unhealed
[1:03:28] it is a shame to not give people the
[1:03:30] opportunity to die out on an altar
[1:03:33] and die there with their sacrifice you
[1:03:36] see that's the whole
[1:03:37] secret of the new birth it isn't just
[1:03:40] making a little profession of faith oh i
[1:03:42] believe jesus
[1:03:43] is to be the savior of the world but
[1:03:45] it's more than that
[1:03:46] it's you it's you dying out to sin
[1:03:49] and to unbelief and being born again
[1:03:52] you've got to die with your lamb
[1:03:55] die as dead as jesus died died to the
[1:03:58] old man
[1:03:58] your old desires your own sinful nature
[1:04:03] amen that old perverted spirit amen
[1:04:07] you've got to die
[1:04:08] to the whole thing in order to be born
[1:04:11] again
[1:04:13] now we find out this light this tree
[1:04:16] christ was is rejected again by the
[1:04:18] church what do they do
[1:04:20] they'll take a false glare of the light
[1:04:22] rather than taking the true light
[1:04:25] amen these are false glares and and
[1:04:28] listen church
[1:04:29] to us he's got to be the same today
[1:04:32] in every detail as he was in his
[1:04:35] corporal body
[1:04:37] amen doing the same thing now again
[1:04:40] we we're at the end of the last age and
[1:04:44] i'm quoting brother branham
[1:04:45] on this one and and there's a man that
[1:04:47] can turn on the light if we're
[1:04:49] at the if we're at the last end
[1:04:52] of the age where is them greater works
[1:04:56] going to come and he says we're here
[1:05:03] amen we're here it's the day at the last
[1:05:06] of the age that the greater works that
[1:05:09] jesus spoke about
[1:05:11] must be fulfilled there cannot be a
[1:05:14] rapture there cannot be
[1:05:16] the change of the body there cannot be a
[1:05:18] resurrection
[1:05:19] without fulfilling the word are you with
[1:05:23] me
[1:05:23] amen but now notice it's not to be less
[1:05:28] of his works but more of his works
[1:05:31] it is actually to be magnified
[1:05:35] let me just share with you the way he
[1:05:37] spoke about it he said
[1:05:38] the east or the west here has come back
[1:05:41] and met the east in other words
[1:05:43] it's come right back around to the same
[1:05:45] thing again
[1:05:46] it was moses even picked up sand and
[1:05:49] said let there be fleas and
[1:05:51] so and so forth like that on the earth
[1:05:53] but in the last day he don't take
[1:05:55] anything just the word let it be
[1:05:59] and what is it what is said and that's
[1:06:01] the way
[1:06:02] it will be and he said i'll testify some
[1:06:06] of the things tonight of what's happened
[1:06:08] you'll see he is still god his words
[1:06:10] cannot the works that i do
[1:06:12] shall you do also and greater than this
[1:06:14] shall you do
[1:06:16] i took a fish to make a fish you didn't
[1:06:19] but you don't even have to have a fish
[1:06:23] amen the same son of god that took a
[1:06:26] fish off of a fish
[1:06:27] is the same son of god today the works
[1:06:30] that i do shall you do also
[1:06:32] and greater than this will you do it
[1:06:35] will be
[1:06:36] magnified greater than this
[1:06:41] so we're living in the day where the
[1:06:44] works of christ
[1:06:45] is not just to be here but they are to
[1:06:48] be
[1:06:48] magnified now bear with me if i labor a
[1:06:52] little bit on this but i i want you to
[1:06:54] get it clearly because
[1:06:56] this helps us to know our position
[1:06:59] what is expected of us in this hour what
[1:07:01] parts
[1:07:02] are we to fulfill amen
[1:07:05] he said did you notice when he went to
[1:07:07] make water in the wine he took water
[1:07:10] first and already created sepsis
[1:07:12] and turned it into wine when he fed 5
[1:07:15] 000
[1:07:15] people he took a fish that swam in the
[1:07:17] water and broke it and handed it out and
[1:07:20] multiplied creation
[1:07:22] he took bread that was once weed and
[1:07:24] baked into bread and broke it and hung
[1:07:26] it out
[1:07:27] or handed it out to the people and it
[1:07:29] returned back again
[1:07:30] multiplied creation but in the last days
[1:07:36] where there was no sign of creation he
[1:07:39] speaks it in the creation anyhow
[1:07:42] chose to be the same god that was at the
[1:07:44] beginning
[1:07:46] amen he can create squirrels he can
[1:07:48] create what he wants to
[1:07:50] because he's god and greater than this
[1:07:52] shall you do
[1:07:53] for i go to my father the word is
[1:07:55] infallible and it has to be manifest
[1:07:57] and has to be fulfilled greater than
[1:08:00] this shall you do
[1:08:01] not multiplying but speaking out
[1:08:05] into creation
[1:08:09] no wonder the bible tells us in
[1:08:12] revelation 10 8 you must prophesy or
[1:08:15] speak the word again
[1:08:18] now you see satan knows now
[1:08:23] if the people get the true revelation
[1:08:26] of the true church and what she is and
[1:08:30] what she stands for
[1:08:31] and that she can do the greater works
[1:08:35] are you with me she will be an
[1:08:37] invincible army
[1:08:40] this is what we got to know we can do
[1:08:43] the greater works we are ordained
[1:08:45] commission
[1:08:48] ordered to do the greater works
[1:08:52] the works that i do shall you do also
[1:08:54] and greater
[1:08:57] hallelujah
[1:09:01] now it's in the atonement
[1:09:04] so if it's in the atonement it's for
[1:09:06] every one of us that's in the atonement
[1:09:11] the church claims a greater work by
[1:09:12] preaching the gospel all around the
[1:09:14] world that's where they claim they're
[1:09:15] doing the greater work
[1:09:17] so we're doing the greater work than
[1:09:18] jesus did
[1:09:20] and some fellows said to brother branham
[1:09:22] that said oh we do the greater works
[1:09:24] he said well just do the works that he
[1:09:26] did
[1:09:28] you know do that first and so what we
[1:09:30] got denominational brethren
[1:09:32] that's preaching the gospel all around
[1:09:34] the world he couldn't do that
[1:09:36] he said okay so that's the greater words
[1:09:38] we'll just do the works
[1:09:42] and then we'll talk about the greater
[1:09:44] works
[1:09:46] and then he says are you lecturing
[1:09:48] because that's what the devil wants to
[1:09:50] turn us into is a bunch of lectures
[1:09:53] with just a bunch of fancy teaching amen
[1:09:56] with
[1:09:57] with all mechanics and no dynamics
[1:10:00] are you with me he said are you election
[1:10:02] but jesus never said go into all the
[1:10:04] world and teach this or that
[1:10:05] he said go into all the world and preach
[1:10:08] the gospel
[1:10:09] and to preach is to demonstrate the
[1:10:12] power
[1:10:13] of the holy spirit amen these signs
[1:10:16] shall
[1:10:17] follow them that believe it doesn't come
[1:10:20] by
[1:10:20] lectures and then it comes by the
[1:10:23] presence of the living god
[1:10:25] moving among in human flesh proving
[1:10:28] himself that he was in the
[1:10:29] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:10:31] forever
[1:10:33] amen but it comes so simple and it's the
[1:10:35] simplicity
[1:10:36] that drives the intellectual mind away
[1:10:38] from it it can't be
[1:10:41] that's too simple
[1:10:47] now but i want you to know
[1:10:51] we're preaching the gospel that works
[1:10:55] and it's not just lectures when i think
[1:10:58] about the 10 that was there
[1:10:59] at youth camp and thereafter the the
[1:11:02] last camp that we had
[1:11:03] and one after another of demon spirits
[1:11:06] that were cast out
[1:11:09] amen because of young people being bound
[1:11:11] with pornography and sex
[1:11:13] demons that was driving them out of
[1:11:16] their minds
[1:11:18] am i but deliverance came
[1:11:22] and because there is a church today
[1:11:24] doing the greater works
[1:11:30] that are not just given a lecture but
[1:11:32] are actually
[1:11:33] given a preaching the gospel and that
[1:11:35] means to
[1:11:36] demonstrate the gospel now
[1:11:40] of course the believers are to be
[1:11:41] identified and
[1:11:43] they are they are to be marked or
[1:11:45] identified by
[1:11:46] signs the bible said these signs shall
[1:11:49] follow them that believe that would be
[1:11:51] their identity
[1:11:52] is that right i mean i i thought about
[1:11:55] it as i
[1:11:56] as i raised animals down through the
[1:11:58] years and
[1:11:59] and you know i had a prize heard and
[1:12:02] there were registered animals
[1:12:04] i had my initials was given to me
[1:12:07] as tdp to put in their right ear
[1:12:11] every animal that was bred and known by
[1:12:13] me
[1:12:14] that was that was born on my farm got
[1:12:17] that tattoo in his ear
[1:12:19] he was marked forever and identified
[1:12:23] with me amen
[1:12:26] anybody anywhere can pick up the ear of
[1:12:29] that of that goat
[1:12:30] and pick it up and look at it and see
[1:12:33] that in that ear
[1:12:34] is my initials and they can trace it
[1:12:37] back
[1:12:38] to who to the very person there where it
[1:12:41] was born in his herd
[1:12:43] because that animal is identified with
[1:12:46] me
[1:12:47] now do you know jesus is also a great
[1:12:51] shepherd but i want you to know that in
[1:12:55] his this case not only
[1:12:57] is his sheep marked but
[1:13:00] he himself is marked
[1:13:04] and he puts his own mark that's what i
[1:13:06] was doing putting my mark up my own name
[1:13:09] in that goat's ear
[1:13:12] amen now isaiah 49 14.
[1:13:16] i want to read it to you where he's
[1:13:17] marked he said but zion said
[1:13:20] the lord has forsaken me and my lord
[1:13:23] hath forgotten me
[1:13:27] and he gives a he said wait wait wait a
[1:13:30] minute
[1:13:31] he says can a woman forget her suckling
[1:13:33] child
[1:13:35] that she would not have compassion on
[1:13:36] the son of a womb
[1:13:38] and he said yep they might can
[1:13:42] it's possible a woman to forget
[1:13:45] yet i'll not forget thee for i have
[1:13:49] graven thee
[1:13:52] upon the palms of my hands thou walter
[1:13:55] continually before me
[1:13:58] so now he says of zion which is
[1:14:01] jerusalem
[1:14:02] your name is engraved in the palms of my
[1:14:04] hand but that is true for every believer
[1:14:07] he can never ever forget you
[1:14:10] [Music]
[1:14:12] that mind his whole body carries the
[1:14:14] mark
[1:14:16] of why he came to earth and it was
[1:14:20] for your redemption amen
[1:14:24] oh my no when the sheep is mark you're
[1:14:27] saying
[1:14:28] and i'm quoting this from shepherd to
[1:14:30] the sheepfold when the sheep was marked
[1:14:32] here's a beautiful part
[1:14:33] that's all right preacher but what about
[1:14:35] all these marks then everybody we're
[1:14:37] marked
[1:14:38] one's marked this way and one's marked
[1:14:40] the way once
[1:14:42] an orthodox or episcopalian
[1:14:45] or this let me just say
[1:14:52] that's why you can many times easily
[1:14:56] look at a person
[1:14:58] and see the mark of satan all over them
[1:15:06] come on
[1:15:09] you can see in their dress their
[1:15:11] behavior their walk
[1:15:13] their attitude the mark of satan you'd
[1:15:17] say brother tim
[1:15:18] oh i'm worried about this mark of the
[1:15:20] beast that might come up oh i'm not
[1:15:21] going to take this vaccine because
[1:15:23] they'll get my
[1:15:24] my they'll get my social security oh
[1:15:26] forget it
[1:15:28] they already got you
[1:15:33] you already got a number but what i'm
[1:15:36] worried about is the mark of sin on your
[1:15:38] soul
[1:15:40] the mark of satan that is in people's
[1:15:44] lives
[1:15:45] where they are where they are
[1:15:46] identifying themselves with
[1:15:48] with another shepherd
[1:15:51] a false shepherd are you with me
[1:15:54] but i want you to know that that god's
[1:15:57] sheep will hear his voice
[1:16:01] amen and you might be lost and away from
[1:16:04] god you may be one of the
[1:16:06] the ones that left the 99 and went out
[1:16:08] and you're in the office mess there is
[1:16:10] in the world
[1:16:11] but i tell you there comes a voice of
[1:16:13] god that will awaken the seed gene on
[1:16:15] the inside of you
[1:16:18] hallelujah and when it does you will
[1:16:21] come to the shepherd
[1:16:24] amen maybe you don't even know why
[1:16:26] you're here this morning but that's
[1:16:28] exactly why you're here
[1:16:29] it's the drawing of the shepherd it's
[1:16:32] his voice reaching out
[1:16:34] to you
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:40] know what he's trying to tell you you
[1:16:41] never originally belonged to the devil
[1:16:48] what i come to realize i never was the
[1:16:51] devil's child
[1:16:52] he tried to make him be with him but i
[1:16:55] never was his
[1:16:58] amen he says i'm going to tell him for
[1:17:00] the sake of all
[1:17:01] those who've never maybe heard this
[1:17:03] story but the story of a
[1:17:05] of a little boy you know that made him a
[1:17:06] little sailboat
[1:17:08] he made this little sailboat and he
[1:17:10] loved that sailboat
[1:17:11] oh man he crafted it by hand he made it
[1:17:14] so beautifully to sail
[1:17:16] and he you know he he would get it out
[1:17:18] and he would run it up and down the
[1:17:19] seashore
[1:17:20] or the the shore of the lake and and and
[1:17:23] oh it was a beautiful
[1:17:25] little boat he had lots of fun hours
[1:17:27] playing with it
[1:17:28] one day a big wind came along and blew
[1:17:31] it out of his reach
[1:17:32] and he looked out there and he saw his
[1:17:35] sailboat out of his reach
[1:17:37] and they're drifting further and further
[1:17:39] and further away from him
[1:17:41] and every day he would go down to the
[1:17:43] shore looking to see
[1:17:45] maybe today it washed up maybe today
[1:17:49] and he'd walk along that seesaw looking
[1:17:51] for it
[1:17:53] and there you know he never found it and
[1:17:56] he would look and every day oh my
[1:17:58] sailboat i
[1:17:59] i missed the hours of fun and you know
[1:18:02] all that i had with you and all of this
[1:18:05] one day he was in the town and he he saw
[1:18:09] in a pawn shop looked into the window
[1:18:12] and there was his sailboat
[1:18:16] all this sailboat my sailboat
[1:18:20] he looked in there and he saw the price
[1:18:23] it was a price it was a high price
[1:18:28] he didn't have the money for it i don't
[1:18:29] know if i've scraped up all my change if
[1:18:31] i
[1:18:32] brought my piggy bank i wouldn't have
[1:18:33] the money so you know what he did he
[1:18:36] went and sold
[1:18:37] all that he had all of his toys he sold
[1:18:41] them all
[1:18:43] and he went down to that pawn shop and
[1:18:45] he bought that sailboat
[1:18:50] oh i remember another gravemaker
[1:18:54] amen he left all the glory left all that
[1:18:57] he had
[1:18:58] to come right down to earth for us come
[1:19:01] on
[1:19:02] and when that little boy when he grabbed
[1:19:05] that
[1:19:06] sailboat and he clutched it in his arms
[1:19:08] he could be heard as he walked out of
[1:19:10] the pawn shop
[1:19:12] little boat you are mine you are
[1:19:15] twice mine you were mine when i made you
[1:19:19] and you were mine when i bought you
[1:19:24] and i'm preaching to people today there
[1:19:26] are christ gods
[1:19:28] you were kids before the world began
[1:19:31] you were in his mind you were in his
[1:19:33] thinking and he said i'll never
[1:19:35] ever forget you
[1:19:39] hallelujah and when you were lost from
[1:19:42] him
[1:19:42] he left all the glory to find you
[1:19:45] he left all of heaven he left the throne
[1:19:48] he gave it all
[1:19:49] up to come down to find you
[1:19:52] and he found you in the devil's pawn
[1:19:54] shop
[1:19:56] but he didn't leave you there
[1:20:01] and he can save you today you are fine
[1:20:04] you are twice mine
[1:20:06] [Applause]
[1:20:13] this shepherd bore the mark
[1:20:17] of his sheep in his hand
[1:20:23] he was nailed to the cross
[1:20:28] a mother can forget her suckling's bait
[1:20:31] but i'll never forsake you because your
[1:20:34] names are written
[1:20:36] in my hand i know
[1:20:39] my sheep my sheep know me they're marked
[1:20:42] with the same mark think about that
[1:20:46] now so then his church has got to have
[1:20:50] the same mark
[1:20:52] what kind of mark did he have
[1:20:53] spiritually speaking when he's here on
[1:20:55] the earth he was
[1:20:56] despised and rejected a man of sorrow
[1:20:58] acquainted with grief
[1:21:00] but god was with him signs and wonders
[1:21:03] accompanied him everywhere he went and
[1:21:04] he could discern the thoughts of their
[1:21:06] heart and he said
[1:21:07] i do as the father shows me the sick was
[1:21:10] healed
[1:21:11] the dead was raised up the poor had the
[1:21:13] gospel
[1:21:14] preached and the church of the living
[1:21:17] god
[1:21:17] bears the mark of the living god
[1:21:21] these things that i do shall you do
[1:21:26] also
[1:21:29] saint john 14 12 he that believeth on me
[1:21:31] the works that i do shall
[1:21:33] he do also and greater than thee shall
[1:21:35] he do for i go to my father
[1:21:37] you're branded
[1:21:40] that is to be the mark of the church the
[1:21:43] the church
[1:21:44] must bear the marks of christ identified
[1:21:47] by his signs and wonders
[1:21:50] amen you know and again it's to be more
[1:21:53] works because no one can do greater
[1:21:55] because
[1:21:56] but but the because because the works
[1:22:00] would now be done in a multi-member body
[1:22:04] god happened every one of you to do the
[1:22:06] works of god
[1:22:07] amen now so again the works that i do
[1:22:11] now as i say in saying this great
[1:22:15] because no one could do greater because
[1:22:17] he raised the dead he stopped nature
[1:22:20] he done everything that could be done he
[1:22:21] stopped the roaring sea
[1:22:23] he made the winds be still he raised up
[1:22:25] the dead after they were corrupted in
[1:22:27] the grave and
[1:22:28] no one could do that any greater in
[1:22:30] quantity
[1:22:32] but being that his spirit would come
[1:22:34] into church and reach out it would be a
[1:22:36] universal church
[1:22:37] all around the world and they could do
[1:22:39] more of the same things
[1:22:40] that he was doing amen
[1:22:45] now this is important because this is a
[1:22:48] last day scripture
[1:22:50] this as i read you was to be fulfilled
[1:22:53] in the
[1:22:54] end of the last age
[1:22:58] now i don't know what you're going to do
[1:23:00] if you done left this last age
[1:23:02] but if you're here in this last age
[1:23:04] you'll do the works of christ
[1:23:07] now notice the again brother branham
[1:23:10] said
[1:23:11] he would continue he wants to bring the
[1:23:13] holy ghost to you
[1:23:14] to continue the same works that he was
[1:23:17] doing in christ
[1:23:18] the work wasn't so needy in the days of
[1:23:21] luther that was god's church
[1:23:23] but it was a bit more neater in the days
[1:23:25] of wesley
[1:23:26] because the world the bible said would
[1:23:28] get weaker and wiser
[1:23:30] and more wickeder all the time
[1:23:34] the world is getting more wicked we know
[1:23:38] that why do men do what they're doing a
[1:23:40] hundred years ago you would
[1:23:41] never thought there'd be a human being
[1:23:43] that cruel
[1:23:45] more wicked all the time and the wicked
[1:23:47] shall do wickeder
[1:23:49] all the time said the scripture
[1:23:52] more and more how many knows we're in a
[1:23:55] day of increased
[1:23:56] iniquity amen and he would even be in a
[1:24:00] time of the increased iniquity that the
[1:24:02] love of many would wax coal
[1:24:05] it would be as more wickedness would
[1:24:07] abound
[1:24:08] and and evil would continue until
[1:24:11] men would be of a reprobate mind
[1:24:14] concerning the truth
[1:24:17] they're depraved they'll do things that
[1:24:21] are
[1:24:21] unseemly and brother timothy read that
[1:24:24] from romans
[1:24:25] 1 the other day the perversions that's
[1:24:27] in the land today
[1:24:30] amen god never intends that
[1:24:33] it's not of god god made them one male
[1:24:35] and one female
[1:24:37] amen this is what true marriage is
[1:24:40] you say brother tim but i have tendency
[1:24:43] that's a lie
[1:24:44] of the devil
[1:24:47] amen that's a satanic anointing that
[1:24:50] didn't come from god
[1:24:52] it didn't come from your maker it's the
[1:24:54] mark of satan trying to destroy
[1:24:56] life are you with me amen but jesus came
[1:25:00] that you might have life and life more
[1:25:02] abundantly
[1:25:03] and i'll tell you there is healing and
[1:25:05] deliverance
[1:25:07] in the name of jesus amen as we said
[1:25:10] today is a day of miracles
[1:25:13] now satan has been moving and moving
[1:25:15] steadily
[1:25:16] why brother we're seeing things even in
[1:25:19] our nations
[1:25:21] here we came across the across from the
[1:25:24] other lands
[1:25:25] as the pilgrims why did they come they
[1:25:27] come for religious freedoms
[1:25:30] amen because rome had put such pressure
[1:25:34] upon them until they couldn't worship
[1:25:37] with freedom of religion
[1:25:40] is that right now today they want it
[1:25:42] they take they take liberty so far they
[1:25:44] want freedom from religion
[1:25:48] and man they press it further than what
[1:25:49] was ever intended
[1:25:51] freedoms are taken further than it was
[1:25:54] ever intended
[1:25:56] amen the rights to marry is taken
[1:25:59] further than
[1:26:00] ever intended never was intended for men
[1:26:04] to marry men
[1:26:05] and women to marry women that wasn't
[1:26:06] never intended our constitution didn't
[1:26:09] didn't write that they didn't believe
[1:26:11] that
[1:26:12] it's when our liberties you see they
[1:26:15] turn
[1:26:15] the grace of god into lasciviousness or
[1:26:18] a license to sin
[1:26:22] permission to do evil
[1:26:27] amen and what does it do it's a
[1:26:31] horrible influence upon young children
[1:26:35] my mind it you use uh it corrupts the
[1:26:37] mind
[1:26:38] it destroys lives now satan
[1:26:42] satan has been moving steadily as i said
[1:26:45] we came over here for freedom of
[1:26:46] religion
[1:26:47] and and as a as a nation what no no time
[1:26:51] here
[1:26:51] the catholics followed right behind us
[1:26:54] today
[1:26:55] the very rome that persecuted the church
[1:26:58] that exterminated 68 million
[1:27:02] of believers come on
[1:27:06] this is their history they know hey man
[1:27:09] just read fox's book of martyr's day
[1:27:11] it's written it's recorded but he's been
[1:27:14] moving steadily and now
[1:27:16] of the eight supreme justices that we
[1:27:19] have
[1:27:20] all a roman catholic but two jews
[1:27:23] and then mr biden is elected which i
[1:27:27] don't know what's going to happen there
[1:27:28] he'll be the you'll be a roman catholic
[1:27:30] president
[1:27:32] so here we are and now
[1:27:36] but you know what's so amazing the
[1:27:39] horror of the book of revelation the
[1:27:41] bible calls her a horse she sits on
[1:27:43] seven heels she's reading purple and
[1:27:45] scarlet
[1:27:48] you know why she's a because she
[1:27:50] was to stay true to the word
[1:27:52] and she mixed her seed with others she
[1:27:55] took in other lovers
[1:27:58] come on that's what made her a i
[1:28:01] mean i know that's plain but still
[1:28:02] that's what made her hard the bible
[1:28:04] calls her
[1:28:05] and her daughters are like her the other
[1:28:07] denominational systems are harlots
[1:28:10] the bible says so somebody's got to
[1:28:13] fulfill that
[1:28:14] but thank god there's a virgin bride too
[1:28:17] and somebody's going to fulfill that too
[1:28:20] is that right amen but you see the world
[1:28:23] is becoming
[1:28:24] so immoral it takes the horror to appear
[1:28:28] as
[1:28:29] moral
[1:28:32] she is a mother trans iranian sum of the
[1:28:35] immorality of her children oh don't do
[1:28:37] that
[1:28:38] you know but you know but it's for her
[1:28:41] own
[1:28:42] agenda and for the most part
[1:28:46] let's just take it on the other side mr
[1:28:48] trump is a vile man
[1:28:51] but the uh but the but the ups but
[1:28:54] upside these
[1:28:55] left wingers he appears as a saint
[1:29:00] amen because the world is extremely
[1:29:03] wicked and it is children for
[1:29:05] destruction
[1:29:07] so why are you preaching like this not
[1:29:09] to preach politics
[1:29:11] i am preaching this because there's
[1:29:13] somebody
[1:29:14] going to escape the things that are
[1:29:16] coming up on the earth
[1:29:18] there's somebody going in a rapture
[1:29:21] there's somebody hallelujah will be
[1:29:24] translated like enoch was like elijah
[1:29:26] was we read about
[1:29:28] [Applause]
[1:29:33] and we're in the days of it that's right
[1:29:41] so brother branham says he says
[1:29:44] again it's been more wickeder all the
[1:29:47] time the world is getting weaker
[1:29:49] and wiser more wicked all the time
[1:29:53] but what's this so has the holy spirit
[1:29:57] been moving
[1:30:01] that's why i told you when we heard
[1:30:03] about this kobe coming
[1:30:05] and people was calling death angel and
[1:30:07] they was getting all afraid and all of
[1:30:08] this and that
[1:30:09] and i said but every time you see the
[1:30:11] devil move
[1:30:13] god is moving somewhere
[1:30:17] hallelujah amen and we've faced mr
[1:30:21] covete and overcome
[1:30:22] [Music]
[1:30:24] amen come on amen
[1:30:27] you see because let the devil do his
[1:30:30] worst
[1:30:32] jesus christ is at his best
[1:30:35] that won't be enough for us this morning
[1:30:38] amen
[1:30:38] we can lean on those everlasting arms
[1:30:41] and no
[1:30:42] we're secure from all harm
[1:30:46] so he says the holy spirit has been
[1:30:49] moving there was a little breath of it
[1:30:50] with luther a little blow of it with
[1:30:53] wesley and a deeper blow
[1:30:55] with the pentecost and now the breath
[1:30:57] and the spirit
[1:30:58] has become the same and she's united and
[1:31:01] bringing forth that same powerful blow
[1:31:04] with the holy ghost
[1:31:05] like he did back there is a manifest in
[1:31:07] the same works that he did back there
[1:31:09] is being manifested right today the same
[1:31:12] thing watch what jesus said
[1:31:13] verily verily i say to you the son can
[1:31:15] do nothing except he sees
[1:31:17] the father doing it first what the
[1:31:18] father does he shows the son
[1:31:20] the father dwelleth in me he doeth the
[1:31:23] works
[1:31:26] amen and you know what part of the
[1:31:29] greater work says part of the greater
[1:31:32] works
[1:31:33] is to impart life
[1:31:39] are you with me amen you know there's
[1:31:42] it's great work to heal the sick
[1:31:46] it's a great work to cast out devils by
[1:31:48] prayer
[1:31:50] those are great works amen and
[1:31:53] and like i said that ought to be the
[1:31:55] principal job of the church to cast out
[1:31:58] devils
[1:32:00] because every time a man is saved the
[1:32:02] devil is cast out
[1:32:05] amen you say well brother tim i got
[1:32:07] devils and i need to be delivered
[1:32:09] i'll tell you how repent
[1:32:12] invite another king to come sit on your
[1:32:14] throne
[1:32:17] amen but he's not going to come in and
[1:32:19] co-occupy the throne
[1:32:22] you've got to get rid of one for another
[1:32:24] to come
[1:32:26] the lord dealt with me this morning
[1:32:28] three o'clock about this
[1:32:31] brother joe asked me in the back what
[1:32:32] are you troubled about i said that's why
[1:32:35] because at three o'clock this morning
[1:32:36] god was dealing with me
[1:32:40] in order for christ to reign in you
[1:32:42] there's got to be a dethroning of
[1:32:44] satan's sin nature
[1:32:46] inside of you
[1:32:50] the two cannot dwell together
[1:32:58] but impart eternal life to believers
[1:33:02] is part of our works in fact
[1:33:06] it's greater works it's a greater work
[1:33:10] than healing the sick that's right
[1:33:12] casting out devils
[1:33:14] amen to impart eternal life you see
[1:33:18] this is what calvary meant it meant to
[1:33:20] take stoop
[1:33:21] degraded men listen this is where we are
[1:33:24] in time remember
[1:33:25] the last call the last
[1:33:28] call that comes out is to go out in the
[1:33:30] highways and the byways
[1:33:34] and compel them to come in the last call
[1:33:37] is for those that
[1:33:40] looks unredeemable that looks
[1:33:42] unforgivable
[1:33:44] that is so messed up
[1:33:47] that only grace could turn their lives
[1:33:49] around
[1:33:51] that's where the last call comes
[1:33:57] and i'm looking at some of you that are
[1:33:58] saints today that were them kind of
[1:34:00] people
[1:34:02] but of god god-rich and mercy turned
[1:34:04] your life around
[1:34:05] he wouldn't let you stay there he
[1:34:07] wouldn't let you rot
[1:34:08] in the mire in the muck of sin
[1:34:12] we got deacons in this church we had
[1:34:13] preachers in this church we got we got
[1:34:15] all
[1:34:16] all kinds that have been that were in
[1:34:18] the lowest
[1:34:19] levels of sin but god rich in mercy
[1:34:24] and i'll tell you if he can do it for
[1:34:26] you if he can do it for
[1:34:28] me he can do it for you
[1:34:33] hallelujah and the last call goes out in
[1:34:36] the highways and the byways
[1:34:37] and compels them come and say i must
[1:34:40] have
[1:34:40] men and women at my feast
[1:34:44] hey mom they reject my marriage feast
[1:34:46] say you reject being united with me
[1:34:48] amen i made the call once said i i've
[1:34:51] got to riches and mother says i
[1:34:53] i've got uh goods to look after and i
[1:34:56] married a wife you know that's a lot of
[1:34:58] men's problems
[1:35:02] a lot of women's trouble too they
[1:35:04] married a man
[1:35:06] and it was a hindrance
[1:35:18] and i'm not even preaching about you
[1:35:20] saints that are married right there
[1:35:22] don't take that one god gave you a wife
[1:35:27] and you say she's been my hindrance you
[1:35:29] know what i'd do i'd get down to an
[1:35:31] altar somewhere until i got rid
[1:35:33] of the hindrance in my own soul
[1:35:40] until i become a priest in my home that
[1:35:42] i could
[1:35:43] bring down heaven into my home and
[1:35:46] change
[1:35:47] situations rather than change wives
[1:35:54] too many times we're so interested in
[1:35:56] changing others we forget to look in the
[1:35:58] mirror and see i'm the one
[1:36:03] let it start with me
[1:36:06] but you see what calvary did it took
[1:36:08] stoop degraded men and women and lifted
[1:36:11] them to a place to be sons and daughters
[1:36:12] of god
[1:36:13] to heal the sick and they empowered
[1:36:15] eternal life
[1:36:16] by giving the holy ghost to obedient
[1:36:18] believers men who were once
[1:36:20] unbelievers were made believers and in
[1:36:22] impart
[1:36:24] spiritual life this has got to be the
[1:36:27] work of the church
[1:36:29] no wonder the devil is so against altar
[1:36:32] cults
[1:36:34] did you hear what i said the devil
[1:36:38] said brother tim in our church we preach
[1:36:39] against altar because it's the devil
[1:36:45] amen he said well brother tim we don't
[1:36:46] have to have an altar everybody has to
[1:36:48] have an altar
[1:36:50] you read the book of hebrews you can't
[1:36:52] approach god except through the altar
[1:36:55] there may not be this altar right here
[1:36:58] but it's an altar somewhere if it's in
[1:37:00] your heart or in the closet or wherever
[1:37:02] it is
[1:37:03] you've got to have an altar where you
[1:37:05] die
[1:37:06] to sin and the unbelieving are born
[1:37:08] again by the holy spirit
[1:37:12] and it's a crying shame when the church
[1:37:14] is around around
[1:37:16] even around the message remove the altar
[1:37:18] out of the church and put it in the
[1:37:19] basement
[1:37:24] because our principal work ought to be
[1:37:26] to preach calvary
[1:37:31] well brother tim we're in the day mercy
[1:37:33] is over oh
[1:37:34] wait a minute when did god die and leave
[1:37:36] you in charge
[1:37:38] mercy's not over man just
[1:37:42] you you have never tasted mercy so you
[1:37:44] haven't undergiven
[1:37:47] when you have mercy jesus said freely as
[1:37:51] you receive freely gift
[1:37:53] so if you receive mercy you're going to
[1:37:55] give mercy
[1:37:57] that's the whole thing of what it does
[1:38:00] for you it
[1:38:00] it takes the hearty and the proud and it
[1:38:03] makes somebody
[1:38:04] with a soul that longs to see someone
[1:38:08] else saved what is one of the signs he
[1:38:12] said i'll put a mark on those that
[1:38:14] sign cry for the abominations in the
[1:38:16] city
[1:38:18] amen i'll identify mine elect
[1:38:21] by desiring their heart they will have a
[1:38:24] desire to see the law saved
[1:38:32] now when jesus was there he could not
[1:38:35] impart the holy spirit
[1:38:38] he said if i go not away the comforter
[1:38:40] cannot come
[1:38:43] in me dwells upon us to the godhead
[1:38:45] bodily
[1:38:46] i'm with you now but i will be in you
[1:38:49] but in order to do that i got to go to
[1:38:51] calvary
[1:38:53] and in order to go to calvary there i'll
[1:38:55] get my life
[1:38:56] i'll raise from the dead i'll send the
[1:38:58] glory i send the glory but i'll come
[1:39:00] again
[1:39:02] people talk about the coming of the lord
[1:39:04] and they don't know the first thing
[1:39:05] about it the first thing about is coming
[1:39:07] is the day of pentecost amen
[1:39:12] because on the day of pentecost he came
[1:39:14] again
[1:39:16] not another jesus not another spirit
[1:39:19] the same spirit the bible said if you
[1:39:22] don't have the spirit of christ you're
[1:39:23] none of his
[1:39:28] the holy spirit came down on the day of
[1:39:30] pentecost to impart
[1:39:31] life now so you see
[1:39:35] the church is to do the greater work in
[1:39:38] other words they are to preach the
[1:39:39] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:39:41] so this has got to be one of our main
[1:39:43] thrusts as a church
[1:39:45] to preach the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:39:47] and
[1:39:48] no it's not emotion but emotion comes
[1:39:51] with it
[1:39:52] it's not a sensation but it is
[1:39:54] sensational
[1:39:57] it's not a feeling but it can be felt
[1:40:00] somebody help me preach hey man
[1:40:04] amen it's not a tongue but it does have
[1:40:06] tongues with it
[1:40:08] it's not a shout but shouting does come
[1:40:10] with it
[1:40:12] oh man rejoicing it's not rejoicing
[1:40:14] people get happy over a piece of pie
[1:40:20] bring me a piece today after church and
[1:40:21] i'll show y'all get out
[1:40:25] but it is let me tell you happiness is
[1:40:29] not the holy ghost
[1:40:30] but the holy ghost brings happiness
[1:40:36] amen so as elisha received the
[1:40:40] mantle of elijah and thus double his
[1:40:43] anointing
[1:40:44] even so the church is to be baptized
[1:40:47] with the same
[1:40:48] baptism that baptized jesus
[1:40:52] isn't that wonderful i'm going to show
[1:40:54] you in the bible where he said
[1:40:55] his disciples would receive his baptism
[1:40:59] amen let's go to matthew chapter 20
[1:41:02] verse 20.
[1:41:03] we all hear this a lot of times we kind
[1:41:06] of skim over it because of this selfish
[1:41:08] mother this mother
[1:41:09] wanted her children want them to sit uh
[1:41:12] uh you know
[1:41:13] one what to sit on the right hand on the
[1:41:15] other left verse 21 now
[1:41:17] and he said in her what will thou she
[1:41:20] said unto him
[1:41:21] grant that my two sons may sit the one
[1:41:23] on thy right hand and the other on the
[1:41:25] left
[1:41:26] in thy kingdom you know they had it in
[1:41:28] their mind it was going to be a physical
[1:41:30] kingdom and
[1:41:32] he would be the reina son of david and
[1:41:34] they wanted she wanted her son's
[1:41:35] position so she's asking this
[1:41:37] positions i want one to my right and on
[1:41:40] your right and on the left
[1:41:42] and jesus answered and said you don't
[1:41:44] know what you're asking that's right
[1:41:47] and he said are you able to drink the
[1:41:49] cup
[1:41:50] i shall drink up and to be baptized with
[1:41:53] the baptism that i'm baptized with
[1:41:56] and they said unto him we are
[1:41:59] able and he said unto them you
[1:42:04] shall indeed drink of my cup and be
[1:42:06] baptized
[1:42:07] with the baptism i'm baptized with
[1:42:10] so jesus promised that his
[1:42:14] disciples would receive the same baptism
[1:42:18] oh brother them that was water baptism
[1:42:20] no
[1:42:22] they had already been water baptized
[1:42:25] amen and so they asked him are you able
[1:42:28] or he asked them
[1:42:29] are you able to drink up my cup are you
[1:42:32] able to be baptized
[1:42:33] with the same baptism i'm baptized with
[1:42:36] and he said unto them in verse 23
[1:42:38] ye shall indeed drink indeed of my cup
[1:42:41] and be baptized with the baptism that
[1:42:43] i'm baptized with but to sit on my right
[1:42:46] hand on my left

[1:42:49] given to them for whom is prepared of my
[1:42:51] father

[1:42:59] going to be baptized with the baptism i
[1:43:01] am baptized with
[1:43:02] that's right amen now this cup

[1:43:20] bitter persecutions tribulations

[1:44:00] church age

[1:44:34] you know the thing about jesus when he
[1:44:36] was inoculated from sin
[1:44:38] god didn't worry about it he led him by
[1:44:41] the spirit right away to be tempted of
[1:44:43] the devil
[1:44:44] we want to thank old man you know this
[1:44:46] new god this new
[1:44:48] new christian keep them away from sin
[1:44:50] that's not what god did with jesus he
[1:44:52] said take him down there and tempt him
[1:44:54] let lucifer himself trying
[1:44:58] because i'm not afraid of the baptism
[1:45:01] that he's baptized with i am not afraid
[1:45:05] that he's going to get down there and
[1:45:07] get lost again

[1:45:17] can never be lost again
[1:45:19] and he's not afraid of it hey man this
[1:45:22] is why he would say
[1:45:24] about his salvation you ever yeah
[1:45:27] some people say i need the joy of my
[1:45:30] salvation
[1:45:30] it ain't your salvation he never said it
[1:45:33] was
[1:45:34] he said restore to me the joy of thy
[1:45:36] salvation
[1:45:38] the salvation is of the lord it wasn't
[1:45:42] you saving yourself it was him
[1:45:44] saving you amen and because he saved you
[1:45:48] he will never lose you he said the devil
[1:45:51] there is nothing can ever pluck him out
[1:45:53] of my father's hand
[1:45:55] oh hallelujah no wonder you're oh the
[1:45:58] welcome matters laid out
[1:46:00] come unto me everyone that is heavy
[1:46:02] laden and i will give them rest
[1:46:05] my yoke is easy
[1:46:10] ah the yoke of sin is not easy
[1:46:14] it'll put you through hell on earth yes
[1:46:16] a lot of people feel
[1:46:18] hell out in the hereafter you ought to
[1:46:20] feel
[1:46:21] fear the hell is going to come to you by
[1:46:23] living in sin
[1:46:29] it'll be hell in your marriage be hell
[1:46:32] in your homes
[1:46:33] it'll be hell at night when you're
[1:46:35] trying to sleep
[1:46:36] [Music]
[1:46:37] amen it'll be hell everywhere you look
[1:46:40] come on
[1:46:42] amen you say brother tim they think that
[1:46:44] wait for me well let me just tell you
[1:46:46] something
[1:46:46] if you're a child of god it'll be hell
[1:46:48] for you
[1:46:50] because if you're predestinated of god
[1:46:52] you wasn't made to live in the devil's
[1:46:54] hell
[1:46:55] i mean satan's children may be happy in
[1:46:57] hell but we're not going to be happy in
[1:46:58] hell
[1:47:02] amen any believer that would wind up in
[1:47:04] hell would be the most unhappiest people
[1:47:05] because they're out of place
[1:47:07] so they ain't going to go to hell
[1:47:09] because hell was not created for them it
[1:47:11] was created for the devil and his angels
[1:47:13] [Applause]
[1:47:17] somebody said to me it was an account at
[1:47:19] one time i sat down across from he was
[1:47:21] doing my taxes
[1:47:22] and he looked at me and he said preacher
[1:47:24] i don't understand something about the
[1:47:25] bible what y'all are preaching
[1:47:28] i said what are you what are you talking
[1:47:29] about he said well how could a loving
[1:47:32] father send his own children to hell
[1:47:37] and i said he won
[1:47:41] there won't be one of his in hell
[1:47:49] not a one hell was not created for you
[1:47:54] amen and let me just tell you the hell
[1:47:57] if you're a sinner today and you're
[1:47:58] living in the hell
[1:47:59] it was god didn't create that for you
[1:48:01] your own sins created that hell
[1:48:08] i said well i need to change well i'll
[1:48:10] tell you there is a change
[1:48:12] amen there's a change that is needed
[1:48:13] there's a change of a heart
[1:48:16] he said he said in his very word he said
[1:48:18] a new heart and a new
[1:48:20] spirit i will give them and then he said
[1:48:22] i'll place
[1:48:23] my spirit in them so you see
[1:48:26] god will do the greatest exchange that
[1:48:28] could ever be given
[1:48:30] to change a soul there whose heart is
[1:48:33] hardened from sin and i believe and
[1:48:36] change that heart and give them a new
[1:48:38] attitude toward god
[1:48:46] and a new spirit a new desire
[1:48:49] i want to do right
[1:48:54] but god knows you can't make it alone
[1:48:55] with just a new heart and a new spirit
[1:48:58] so he said i'm not going to leave you
[1:48:59] there i'm not through with what i'm
[1:49:01] doing
[1:49:02] i'm going to put my spirit in you and my
[1:49:05] spirit will cause you to walk in my
[1:49:07] statutes and keep my judgments and do
[1:49:09] them
[1:49:10] that's what god's spirit will do in a
[1:49:12] person it'll make them
[1:49:14] obedient to the word
[1:49:19] so you see the cup that the disciples
[1:49:21] would drink
[1:49:22] would be the cup of bitter persecutions
[1:49:26] to be scoffed at to be ridiculed
[1:49:31] to be made fun of that brother tim they
[1:49:35] make fun of my
[1:49:36] long hair and as a girl and well
[1:49:39] you know you're identifying as one of
[1:49:41] his that's right
[1:49:44] since you're identifying as one of his
[1:49:46] that make fun of him
[1:49:51] i might you know you say i'm identified
[1:49:53] with wearing
[1:49:54] you know i i'm made fun of rather with
[1:49:57] wearing a dress
[1:49:58] well yeah because you're not to put on a
[1:49:59] garment that pertains to a man
[1:50:03] this is a bible god said i hate it
[1:50:06] say well brother tim that's just the old
[1:50:07] law there deuteronomy 22 5. that's just
[1:50:10] the old law there
[1:50:11] well what about a man putting on a
[1:50:12] woman's garment
[1:50:15] that's what the bible said amen god
[1:50:19] never wanted the seeds to cross
[1:50:21] he made them distinctly male and female
[1:50:24] it's the devil that comes along and
[1:50:25] brings the perversion
[1:50:28] are you with me amen but you see when
[1:50:31] you
[1:50:31] when you come and drink of his cup
[1:50:33] you're going to be scoffed at and
[1:50:34] ridiculed
[1:50:35] and you ought to rejoice and and counted
[1:50:39] a great honor to be
[1:50:40] accounted worthy to suffer various
[1:50:43] namesake
[1:50:45] he suffered so much on your account
[1:50:49] why don't you want to be identified with
[1:50:51] him
[1:50:54] ought to be identified with him oh holy
[1:50:56] rollers and emo holiness people well
[1:50:58] what do you want to be
[1:50:59] identified unholy people
[1:51:06] amen to be scoffed at
[1:51:10] ridiculed and made fun of you to drink
[1:51:12] that cup
[1:51:14] to be called beelzebub ah
[1:51:17] that church is a bunch of
[1:51:21] black stalking people they're
[1:51:24] uh they're they're they're weird they're
[1:51:27] different
[1:51:28] all these long skirts and long hair
[1:51:31] what's called the bible
[1:51:33] the bible told you the bible told a
[1:51:36] woman not to cut her hair
[1:51:38] the bible told a man not to have long
[1:51:41] hair
[1:51:41] said nature itself you even go against
[1:51:44] nature itself to go and wear long hair
[1:51:48] because you see again because but but
[1:51:50] again it
[1:51:51] is showing the mark that is on you
[1:51:55] but you know what stay that way let me
[1:52:02] let me just say it this way
[1:52:03] the reason why now look you know you
[1:52:07] know
[1:52:08] with one of my animals i could take and
[1:52:11] i could put some other
[1:52:12] numbers through there and wipe out my my
[1:52:14] name
[1:52:16] my letters but it was still there
[1:52:20] it was just covered over my name was
[1:52:23] always there
[1:52:24] in that animal's ear he was marked
[1:52:28] forever
[1:52:30] and maybe it is with you you've been
[1:52:34] marked
[1:52:35] forever maybe with by the devil you were
[1:52:39] marked
[1:52:43] your old forever you know
[1:52:46] your old man your old life marked mired
[1:52:51] amen scarred up by the evils of sin
[1:52:56] and you bore boring your body to marxist
[1:52:59] satan
[1:53:03] but i got something for you you see that
[1:53:07] animal could never be born again with a
[1:53:09] clean ear
[1:53:13] come on but you can be born again
[1:53:17] and god can put his mark upon you and
[1:53:20] mark you with the shepherd's mark and
[1:53:23] say this is
[1:53:24] my sheep
[1:53:27] that old man i'm not identified with
[1:53:29] that verse murk but this new birth
[1:53:31] that is my son that is my daughter and
[1:53:34] i'm identified with them and that's how
[1:53:37] we're identified
[1:53:38] is in our new birth
[1:53:43] now let's just go a little further
[1:53:49] now to be baptized with his baptism did
[1:53:52] you notice he
[1:53:52] they said they were asked yes
[1:53:56] they were asked can you be baptized with
[1:53:58] the baptism i was baptized with
[1:54:01] what a glorious baptism yeah it happened
[1:54:05] after his water baptism
[1:54:08] as an obedient lamb he come to be washed
[1:54:10] in the
[1:54:12] in the water came to the prophet in the
[1:54:15] water
[1:54:17] but think about this for a moment
[1:54:20] you see there was not just a water
[1:54:22] baptism that took place
[1:54:24] and i want to get this to you you can be
[1:54:26] baptized in water
[1:54:28] and go down a dry center come up a
[1:54:30] wetland
[1:54:35] but i want you to hear something jesus
[1:54:37] didn't just have a water baptism
[1:54:40] but the heavens opened and the dove
[1:54:44] like a light a pillar of fire
[1:54:48] are you with me come fluttering down
[1:54:50] like a dove
[1:54:53] amen and dwells upon him
[1:54:56] is that right it abode upon him and it
[1:54:59] came in him
[1:55:01] the very light of that pillar of fire
[1:55:03] come on the inside
[1:55:05] the great i am that i am came to dwell
[1:55:08] in that vessel and that's what jesus
[1:55:10] said can you
[1:55:11] be baptized with this same heavenly
[1:55:14] baptism
[1:55:15] i'm baptized with
[1:55:19] this is why on the day of pentecost this
[1:55:21] is what happened
[1:55:22] there in the upper room come on
[1:55:26] you know there is that flattering dove
[1:55:29] came down at the river jordan it was a
[1:55:32] light
[1:55:32] fluttering around the heavens open he
[1:55:35] was a pillar of fire a whipping whirling
[1:55:37] fire
[1:55:37] here it comes on the day of pentecost
[1:55:39] and there cometh sound from heaven
[1:55:42] like a rushing mighty wind as the wings
[1:55:45] of the holy
[1:55:46] spirit and that pillar of fire came and
[1:55:48] it looked like
[1:55:49] clove and tongues are whipping wings
[1:55:52] of fire and it abode on
[1:55:57] all of them in the upper room and they
[1:55:59] were baptized with the same baptism
[1:56:02] that jesus received
[1:56:06] hallelujah there it is the same baptism
[1:56:10] that jesus got there on the day of
[1:56:13] pentecost they received that same
[1:56:15] baptism
[1:56:16] amen do you see that's exactly why
[1:56:19] you've got to have to
[1:56:20] get this holy ghost just like jesus
[1:56:23] receive the spirit
[1:56:28] now notice now as we're saying this
[1:56:32] because
[1:56:33] you see this this is really important to
[1:56:37] to grasp
[1:56:38] the the importance of it we're baptized
[1:56:40] with this
[1:56:41] important with the same baptism and that
[1:56:44] was the mantle like elijah's mantle
[1:56:48] came down from elijah as he went up in
[1:56:50] the whirlwind
[1:56:51] and he took there the mantle and now
[1:56:54] begin to do the works
[1:56:56] of elijah that's right the same things
[1:56:59] that elijah had done elijah had walked
[1:57:02] up to that river
[1:57:03] smote it with his mantle
[1:57:07] hallelujah and the water's open and now
[1:57:10] jesus comes and and and of course he
[1:57:12] sends the holy spirit and when he does
[1:57:15] he sends back the same mantle oh
[1:57:17] hallelujah
[1:57:19] you want a licensed man let me just tell
[1:57:21] you the battle of jesus
[1:57:22] has been passed over to you hallelujah
[1:57:26] we're
[1:57:26] coming down from his ascension he sends
[1:57:29] back the holy ghost to rest upon the
[1:57:32] church that they can be baptized with
[1:57:34] the same baptism
[1:57:37] the same holy ghost to do the works of
[1:57:40] jesus
[1:57:41] that the works that i do shall you
[1:57:45] do us
[1:57:50] and greater than these for shall you do
[1:57:55] because i'm going to the father and when
[1:57:58] i go to the father i'm
[1:57:59] sending back you got to see me and my
[1:58:01] going away
[1:58:03] you got to see me in my ascension you
[1:58:05] got to see me as i leave as i
[1:58:07] left the earth i'm sending back
[1:58:09] something for the church
[1:58:12] what is it it's a double portion this is
[1:58:15] what
[1:58:15] this is what we're preaching about to
[1:58:17] open the book the transfer title does
[1:58:19] for the sins of god
[1:58:20] it makes us kings with domain and that
[1:58:23] domain
[1:58:24] is the word of god and the priests to to
[1:58:27] to
[1:58:27] intercede for every promise and this
[1:58:30] blood positions us as sons
[1:58:34] and being positioned as a son then you
[1:58:36] have the
[1:58:37] authority and the right to speak
[1:58:42] hey but this is where we come back
[1:58:43] around brother branham said greater
[1:58:45] works
[1:58:47] he said there he took bread and broke
[1:58:50] off and made more bread
[1:58:51] he took water turned it into wine he
[1:58:54] took fish
[1:58:55] and made more fish that's right
[1:58:58] but he said i'm showing you some
[1:59:00] examples of what god's done in this
[1:59:02] day to create things
[1:59:05] and speak them right into existence
[1:59:09] we're talking about a people of mountain
[1:59:10] moving faith
[1:59:15] the blood positioned you as the sun
[1:59:19] and under that blood create
[1:59:23] moses would strike to strike the ground
[1:59:26] it would turn into into insects
[1:59:30] he would strike the water he would turn
[1:59:32] into blood
[1:59:33] he would call for the frogs to come up
[1:59:35] out of the water he called for the flies
[1:59:42] are you with me but now he says the
[1:59:46] works that i do
[1:59:48] this church is going to do also so what
[1:59:51] will it do
[1:59:51] it will heal the sick it will cast out
[1:59:54] devils
[1:59:56] it will speak with new towns amen if
[1:59:59] they drink any deadly thing it will not
[2:00:01] harm them
[2:00:01] i'm just i'm just quoting the scripture
[2:00:04] come on church
[2:00:05] amen and the works that i do shall you
[2:00:07] do also
[2:00:08] and greater than these and it's not
[2:00:10] exclusive to one man anymore
[2:00:12] it wasn't jesus but not any longer
[2:00:16] because he said more than this shall you
[2:00:19] do
[2:00:21] because i go to my father amen
[2:00:25] so why should we take something
[2:00:27] artificial
[2:00:28] when the heavens is full of the genuine
[2:00:31] and the fullness of the holy ghost
[2:00:33] why should we take just a church joining
[2:00:36] when we can be
[2:00:37] filled with the spirit washed by the
[2:00:40] blood
[2:00:40] do the works of christ be have the mark
[2:00:43] of christ
[2:00:51] i'm gonna close this service a little
[2:00:53] early today
[2:01:02] because you have come to the place of a
[2:01:05] people
[2:01:06] of a double portion
[2:01:10] there is healing for the sick
[2:01:13] spiritually or physically
[2:01:18] there is healing for the sick no matter
[2:01:22] how sick you have been
[2:01:25] there's a double portion been given to
[2:01:27] the church
[2:01:28] that no matter how far you stray away
[2:01:30] from christ
[2:01:32] he's here to bring you in and birth you
[2:01:35] again and mark
[2:01:36] you as one of his own
[2:01:40] he promised to send back his holy spirit
[2:01:42] a double portion
[2:01:44] to the church
[2:01:47] which should bow your head with me
[2:01:50] by having musicians come
[2:01:56] yeah i usually preach a little longer
[2:01:57] than this and no i'm not out of notes
[2:02:01] but the holy spirit has taken me down
[2:02:03] some avenues today
[2:02:05] dealing with me very early in the
[2:02:07] morning
[2:02:10] very early
[2:02:14] are you willing to drink of his cup
[2:02:18] will you receive of his baptism
[2:02:27] the holy spirit calling speaking dealing
[2:02:31] with man he said i'll not always strive
[2:02:33] with man
[2:02:37] and he would cut the work short in
[2:02:39] noah's day and destroy all flesh
[2:02:43] with water and he said i'll not do it
[2:02:44] with water again.
[2:02:46] but he said he'd send fire
[2:02:51] when the days of atomic fire nuclear
[2:02:54] warfare
[2:02:55] can destroy this world over many times
[2:02:59] it will burn
[2:03:04] we've already seen the elijah ministry
[2:03:07] come and go to turn hearts of the
[2:03:08] children back to the faith of the
[2:03:12] fathers
[2:03:15] we've already seen the holy spirit
[2:03:19] send that elijah ministry
[2:03:22] we're so close to the burning
[2:03:40] so
[2:03:42] you say brother tim i i'm not afraid
[2:03:45] so afraid of hell today
[2:03:49] what about the hell you're living in
[2:03:57] what about the hell that you made for
[2:03:58] yourself
[2:04:03] my life is all mixed up who did it
[2:04:06] you turned down the voice of god time
[2:04:08] after time
[2:04:12] i'm confused by the tim
[2:04:15] what brought that confusion you listen
[2:04:16] to the wrong voice
[2:04:23] [Music]
[2:04:31] do you want to rule and reign with him
[2:04:33] do you want to be an overcomer
[2:04:41] you want to rise up above that hell that
[2:04:42] you're in
[2:04:44] [Music]
[2:04:48] and find mercy at the foot of the cross
[2:04:53] say i'm really needing a change brother
[2:04:55] tim well
[2:04:56] here's the greatest change could be
[2:04:58] offered to man
[2:05:00] a change of heart
[2:05:05] a change of art
[2:05:08] a change in your spirit
[2:05:12] spirit all gets mixed up and messed up
[2:05:18] it's time to surrender to god it's the
[2:05:20] only thing that can change you
[2:05:23] you can be changed in his presence and
[2:05:26] you don't have to remain the same
[2:05:35] let's just break it by this
[2:05:38] just break through it just a little bit
[2:05:40] by raising your hand to god and say god
[2:05:42] i need out of this hell i'm in
[2:05:45] just raise your hand to god that's it
[2:05:48] god sees you there
[2:05:50] up in the mezzanine there back in the
[2:05:51] back back over here over there there
[2:05:53] here
[2:06:01] i need out of the mess that i've made
[2:06:02] for myself
[2:06:04] i need to find a god reaching mercy
[2:06:09] so what did that do brother tim
[2:06:12] that little move toward god might not
[2:06:15] have been very much but it was a move
[2:06:18] he said draw nigh to god and i'll draw
[2:06:20] nigh to you
[2:06:22] this is his word of promise
[2:06:25] if you reach out to him right now
[2:06:28] let him deal with your heart you say uh
[2:06:32] brother tim i really need deliverance
[2:06:34] i've got spirits that really bind me
[2:06:36] there's only one way
[2:06:38] of deliverance and that's through
[2:06:39] repentance
[2:06:40] [Music]
[2:06:43] you gotta hate sin you gotta hate that
[2:06:45] evil spirit that has caused you to sin
[2:06:48] has pulled you down in the muck of the
[2:06:50] world
[2:06:51] got to come to place you don't love that
[2:06:53] spirit you're not gonna worship him no
[2:06:55] longer
[2:06:56] you worshiped him
[2:06:59] you you've done obeisance to him you've
[2:07:02] fallen down
[2:07:05] you let him come and take control of
[2:07:07] your life
[2:07:09] [Music]
[2:07:11] but it can be different from this day on
[2:07:15] you don't have to be the same anymore
[2:07:17] [Music]
[2:07:22] everyone every child of god been born
[2:07:25] again can tell
[2:07:26] you that when they were born again a
[2:07:28] little heaven came down unto them
[2:07:31] life from heaven

[2:07:41] their atmosphere
