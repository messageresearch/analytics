[7:00] however you can say that this morning
[7:03] more just cover us covers for the mercy
[7:08] in your grace
[7:10] amen the love that you bestowed on us
[7:13] even I had some prairie question he'd
[7:15] take before the Lord this morning hey I
[7:19] want to remember a co-worker Billy
[7:24] Walker it works think he his son maybe
[7:27] it works his son works with a brother
[7:29] Ben Coleman has cancer but they're being
[7:32] tested testified to him about the
[7:34] healing sister Atlanta so that we serve
[7:38] a God who heals cancer he requested that
[7:41] we pray for him this morning also and
[7:45] remember brother Johnathan Middleton
[7:47] been in the hospital with breathing
[7:49] issues here this morning but is asking
[7:52] for prayer still having some trouble
[7:55] with that also I remember brother Mike
[7:57] Dexter he had a shoulder surgery this
[8:01] week just in a tremendous amount of pain
[8:04] the doctors went in there and expecting
[8:08] to find something they knew they knew
[8:10] that he had tore his rotator cuff but
[8:12] also had some calcium buildup there and
[8:15] said normally it's about the size of a
[8:17] pea had two of them in his shoulder but
[8:20] they went in that it was actually to him
[8:22] about the size of a walnut said his pain
[8:25] level must be pretty high as tolerance
[8:27] so but just he's dealing a lot of pain
[8:30] recovering for that so I remember him
[8:33] this morning how many would have a need
[8:35] you just want to make it known to the
[8:36] Lord as for the Joe to come an opener
[8:39] service and prayer this morning
[8:41] remembering these needs amens situations
[8:45] they men also want to pray for Jeffrey
[8:48] Yarborough
[8:49] he goes to brother Doug Baker's or in
[8:52] that area anyway
[8:54] he had a fall has multiple brain bleeds
[8:58] he's a I think a young man and I believe
[9:01] with Down syndrome or something like
[9:04] that and so just had been having a lot
[9:06] of issues lately but he just loves the
[9:08] Lord and loves the worship of the Lord a
[9:10] testimony is he's always listening to
[9:13] tapes and breeding and things are listed
[9:16] and just about God just really loves the

[54:05] Lord amen amen
[54:09] god bless you if you'll turn with me to
[54:12] Revelation 5 and verse 1 we certainly
[54:15] heard of the wonderful not only heard
[54:17] but experienced with you the wonderful
[54:20] outpouring of the Holy Spirit last
[54:22] Sunday as the Lord just moved among you
[54:26] and of course was here for Wednesday
[54:27] night and so hasn't got good to us to
[54:30] give us so many blessings
[54:32] we're not deserving of them but he gives
[54:35] them anyway a man his mercy endures
[54:39] ever it's new every morning a man and
[54:43] here we are approaching to 12 o'clock
[54:45] hour and going to be moving into the
[54:48] afternoon now and so as we as we read
[54:54] from the the Bible let's just accept of
[54:56] something from the Word of God today and
[54:58] I saw in the right hand of him that sat
[55:01] on the throne a book written within and
[55:03] on the backside sealed with seven seals
[55:05] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[55:08] with a loud voice saying who is worthy
[55:11] to open the book and to loose the seals
[55:13] thereof and and no man in heaven nor in
[55:18] earth neither under the earth was able
[55:20] to open the book neither to look thereon
[55:22] and I wept much because no man was found
[55:25] worthy to open to read the book neither
[55:27] to look thereon and one of the elders
[55:30] said to me weep not behold the Lion of
[55:33] the tribe of Judah the root of David
[55:35] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[55:39] loose the seven seals thereof and I
[55:42] beheld and lo in the midst of the throne
[55:44] and of the four beasts in the midst of
[55:46] the elders stood a lamb as it had been
[55:49] slain heaven seven horns and seven eyes
[55:52] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[55:55] forth into all the earth and he came and
[55:58] took the book out of the right hand of
[56:00] him that sat on the throne and when he
[56:03] had taken the book the four beasts and
[56:05] pointed twenty elders fell down before
[56:06] the lamb having every one of them harps
[56:09] and golden vials full of odours which
[56:11] are the prayers of the saints and they
[56:14] sung a new song saying thou art worthy
[56:17] to take the book and to open the seals
[56:20] thereof for that was slain and has
[56:23] redeemed us to God by the that blood out
[56:25] of every kindred and tongue and people
[56:29] and nation and has made us unto our God
[56:32] kings and priests and we shall reign on
[56:37] the earth god bless you you can have
[56:40] your seats I'm going to take a few
[56:43] moments today and just to kind of bring
[56:49] you up to what we were doing last week
[56:52] is you know
[56:53] most of you know I was with brother Ron
[56:55] Spencer in Alton Virginia he lives in a
[57:00] little town of grottoes and and but the
[57:03] church is in Elton Minh and as you as
[57:07] you know that some of the sermons that I
[57:09] spoke here and that I even spoke to him
[57:12] while I was while I was preaching those
[57:15] sermons here and I'm I went there too
[57:18] and personally addressed him in his
[57:20] church and really this this trip was
[57:24] reminiscent of the trip that I made some
[57:28] 12 years ago
[57:29] when he lay dying after a propane torch
[57:36] accident and was burned severely and
[57:39] laid there in a coma for nearly three
[57:44] weeks and and and then and then of
[57:48] course they would pronounce him
[57:49] brain-dead and and and was was just
[57:53] within hours of planet they were
[57:56] planning to within just hours within
[57:59] five hours to harvest his organs as he
[58:02] was an organ donator and so and of
[58:06] course we saw God come on the scene in a
[58:09] very miraculous way and raised him up
[58:12] from that condition and but I you know
[58:16] again it was reminiscent of that trip
[58:19] that I made some 12 years ago I've been
[58:22] wanting to go there and to be with
[58:23] brother Ron Spencer and his church and
[58:26] the family there and feeling the urge
[58:29] but just not knowing when you know it's
[58:31] some a lot of times you can feel an urge
[58:35] to do something and and the Lord moving
[58:39] on your heart but you want to do it at
[58:40] the right time and so you know I just
[58:46] didn't know when to go there was several
[58:48] different times where he went for tests
[58:51] for the the cancer and would be
[58:54] receiving news and so on like that and
[58:57] there was several opportunities to go
[58:59] brother Joe green actually came from
[59:01] North Carolina went with him to those
[59:03] those times
[59:05] that was very very wonderful of him to
[59:08] to be there and support brother Ron and
[59:10] his family at that time but you know
[59:14] again I didn't know when I was to go I
[59:16] was just feeling the the urge to go and
[59:18] but the Timothy encouraged me by saying
[59:21] you know once again go now
[59:24] you know because that's what he did the
[59:27] last time when I was telling him I was
[59:29] feeling led to go but I just didn't know
[59:32] when and I was at the barn doing chores
[59:35] if you remember 12 years ago the the
[59:38] story of it and brother Timothy said go
[59:41] now dad and I said today I said I'm not
[59:44] through doing George he said we'll take
[59:45] care of them you just get mom and y'all
[59:48] head out and of course we would we would
[59:50] jump in the car it was just a just
[59:53] within an hour or so and and leave out
[59:55] and go all day and and stop for the
[59:59] night and go the next day cuz it's about
[1:00:01] 18 20 hour drive and so this time again
[1:00:06] brother Timothy was coming back home
[1:00:08] from Missouri from a meeting on Monday
[1:00:11] and he said and said dad I feel the same
[1:00:15] way it is now time for you to go and I
[1:00:17] said well you know it that's great son
[1:00:21] for you to know when to good for me to
[1:00:23] go but IIIi really need to know you know
[1:00:27] when I need to go and and so I just you
[1:00:32] know went to back to prayer about it and
[1:00:34] thinking of it and considered it and and
[1:00:38] you know God just miraculously gave us
[1:00:41] tickets to go that was very reasonable
[1:00:43] to go to to fly him to Charlottesville
[1:00:48] Virginia and my wife went along on the
[1:00:51] companion ticket so she went free and
[1:00:54] and so you know let me just say that we
[1:00:58] had a there was just so many many
[1:01:01] supernatural moments it's just difficult
[1:01:04] to tell all of them recall all of them
[1:01:08] perfectly but just signs from God and
[1:01:12] words of encouragement see ever since I
[1:01:15] heard of the attack on brother
[1:01:17] Ronna I've been prayin diligently for
[1:01:19] him I heard it actually the day after
[1:01:21] Christmas and I had I had been like
[1:01:26] Joshua looking at the like looking at
[1:01:30] the walls of Jericho and you know the
[1:01:33] enemy's walled off how do I get to him
[1:01:35] how do we how do we here so here's one
[1:01:38] of our ministers um that has been
[1:01:41] attacked and what can I do how do we how
[1:01:45] do we get to that enemy that is that
[1:01:48] we've got to break through that wall and
[1:01:50] you know brother branham told us he said
[1:01:55] it's one of the most marvelous things
[1:01:56] I've seen in my life when the greatest
[1:01:59] hours of my life is when I get up
[1:02:02] against the wall that I can't get over
[1:02:04] or under it around it that's right and
[1:02:07] then I trust God and he opens the way
[1:02:09] and I go through the thing God takes you
[1:02:11] to it and then you come out on the other
[1:02:13] side it's like Samson when he killed the
[1:02:17] lie and then he got the sweetest honey
[1:02:19] he ever got out of that old carcass of
[1:02:22] that line and he said sometimes have you
[1:02:25] overcome something by the grace of God
[1:02:27] it'll be one of the sweetest things you
[1:02:29] ever tasted of in your life you know
[1:02:32] spiritually what I was speaking of and
[1:02:34] of course you know um we on the 1st of
[1:02:37] February we had brother Matt Watkins
[1:02:39] here and he was speaking our youth
[1:02:42] banquet and and then on on February the
[1:02:45] 2nd he spoke here for us on Sunday and
[1:02:48] his message was just a really timely
[1:02:51] message of God before us is what he
[1:02:54] ministered on if you hadn't heard it
[1:02:56] yeah then you got a responsibility go
[1:02:59] hear what God said to us and he not
[1:03:03] having it in his notes you know and of
[1:03:06] course I'm praying and asking God you
[1:03:08] know for ever every way for him to speak
[1:03:11] to me and he he just he said it wasn't
[1:03:15] it's not my notes but you know I just
[1:03:17] felt lived felt led to bring in about
[1:03:20] Jericho and those walls and and being
[1:03:23] walled off and he says you know it said
[1:03:26] don't look for a
[1:03:28] a new way for God to use you but use
[1:03:31] what God has already given you and take
[1:03:34] what's in your hand and he used gives
[1:03:36] different examples of Shamgar and and
[1:03:40] you know Samson and so on like that that
[1:03:43] men David with a little sling that he
[1:03:45] used what was you know the way that God
[1:03:48] used him and he told us over again we
[1:03:51] can't go back we're in a place we must
[1:03:53] go forward and we must start from where
[1:03:56] we're at and so you know this was very
[1:04:01] very important to me because I had been
[1:04:05] praying and just seeking the Lord as a
[1:04:08] god and my wife can tell you that um you
[1:04:12] know that it wouldn't be a night that
[1:04:14] went by that I didn't pray and said Lord
[1:04:16] somehow speak to me son looking to hear
[1:04:20] your voice I you know I'm not prone to
[1:04:23] visions but you said all the old men
[1:04:26] will dream dreams and young men will see
[1:04:28] visions and I said so I didn't have many
[1:04:30] visions when well you know our
[1:04:32] inhibitions when I was just a young man
[1:04:34] so you can make up for lost time for me
[1:04:37] as an old man but somehow to speak to me
[1:04:39] and you know so I was I was praying that
[1:04:44] way is as there's about three ways that
[1:04:47] the Lord uses to speak to me in and
[1:04:49] others in dreams and then in his voice
[1:04:52] audible voice that I've heard on
[1:04:55] numerous occasions and and then of
[1:04:57] course um other times were that just
[1:05:01] experience were we're song comes right
[1:05:04] out of heaven to me and when when I'm
[1:05:07] when I'm asleep and I waked up hearing
[1:05:10] from that heavenly round and so you know
[1:05:14] III was hearing from brother brother
[1:05:19] but the Matt saying you know don't look
[1:05:22] for a new way for God to speak to you
[1:05:24] just look for the way that God uses you
[1:05:26] and so you know though those things I
[1:05:29] was just took it in my heart and is you
[1:05:32] know brother wrong brother Timothy
[1:05:33] brother George and I were to go to Japan
[1:05:36] and to the Philippines and and not a
[1:05:40] feelin led not
[1:05:41] go at this time because of brother runs
[1:05:43] illness and then the corona virus that
[1:05:46] has affected our meetings it wasn't that
[1:05:49] you know that we can't travel it's that
[1:05:52] many of the people that were going to
[1:05:54] meet us from India and Indonesia and
[1:05:56] other places that were gathering that
[1:05:58] their countries wouldn't let them to
[1:06:00] travel without being quarantined and
[1:06:03] some of them it actually I understand
[1:06:05] you know review services and so on and
[1:06:08] and so they we couldn't have the people
[1:06:11] that were going to gather with us in
[1:06:13] Japan so I decided to put it off and
[1:06:16] right now tentatively we're going in
[1:06:18] June that's um still tentatively we're
[1:06:21] we're just praying the Lord will you
[1:06:24] know opened the door or whatever you
[1:06:26] wants done so instead of going to to
[1:06:30] Japan and flying out there we my wife
[1:06:35] and I flew to Charlottesville to be with
[1:06:38] brother Ron Spencer and we arrived there
[1:06:42] on Thursday and brother Ronon and sister
[1:06:46] Connie brother Matthew was there to
[1:06:48] greet us
[1:06:49] it was just an emotional time this
[1:06:52] brother wrong didn't know I was coming
[1:06:54] and they had brought him up to their
[1:06:58] brother Matthew had told him said well
[1:07:00] I've got an appointment here we got to
[1:07:03] go to the to the airport so they'd went
[1:07:06] and hung around for a little while and
[1:07:08] went to the airport and he said what are
[1:07:10] you going to here for he said well it's
[1:07:12] for meeting with the TSA well that
[1:07:15] happens to me Tim secret agency so you
[1:07:21] know so you know as I walked out you
[1:07:25] know brother ron was not expecting me
[1:07:27] and he just grabbed me and weapon my
[1:07:29] shoulder it was like we were there alone
[1:07:31] as hundreds of people just walked by and
[1:07:34] we were just oblivious to everybody
[1:07:36] around
[1:07:36] he prayed that morning he says God I
[1:07:40] need a boost and so you know we when we
[1:07:46] had heard of his diagnosis which is mr.
[1:07:51] Detmer status
[1:07:54] melanoma cancer and it's went to his
[1:07:56] lungs and as usually starts melanoma
[1:08:00] usually starts in the skin somewhere and
[1:08:02] moves to other organs and when it does
[1:08:03] you know if it moves them from from
[1:08:07] there from just the surface of the skin
[1:08:09] that stage one goes deeper stage 2 stage
[1:08:12] 3 it goes to lymph node Stage four it
[1:08:15] goes to lung or another organ and so you
[1:08:18] know we'd heard of his diagnosis and
[1:08:21] brother Donnie Regan texts me about it
[1:08:25] and he said brother Tim I'm just
[1:08:27] heartbroken about it and I said well you
[1:08:29] know I'm headed to Charlottesville
[1:08:31] tomorrow son said why don't you just
[1:08:33] meet me there and we'll double up on the
[1:08:36] devil you know I figure you know want to
[1:08:40] put a thousand of light and to put ten
[1:08:42] thousand so we went to the airport and
[1:08:46] went from the airport word to the
[1:08:48] Spencer home brother Donnie and sister
[1:08:50] Carol had arrived and had been led in
[1:08:52] their home would have been waiting there
[1:08:54] but you know as we visited and talked
[1:08:58] and whatever you know we hadn't Friday
[1:09:03] that we were going to be together and I
[1:09:05] didn't know how things were gonna
[1:09:07] transpire I just knew I wanted the right
[1:09:09] atmosphere and the right moment and you
[1:09:12] know the right time just be right in the
[1:09:15] vision I didn't know exactly how this
[1:09:17] was going to be and but brother Ron
[1:09:21] wasn't gonna wait for another day for a
[1:09:23] prayer no no no he wasn't gonna wait til
[1:09:26] Friday when we had all day and you know
[1:09:29] I kind of envisioned talking and then
[1:09:31] going over the scriptures and spending
[1:09:33] the day with him and having prayer but
[1:09:36] no he wasn't gonna wait for another day
[1:09:38] and you know he was he wasn't like
[1:09:42] Pharaoh who when when he was asked you
[1:09:46] know when do you want the frogs to leave
[1:09:47] he said well tomorrow and so he was
[1:09:51] willing to spend another night with the
[1:09:53] Broncs
[1:09:54] and so but he wasn't like Pharaoh he
[1:09:57] said I won't prayer right now
[1:09:58] and I saw I said okay right now he said
[1:10:03] right now I said well we got all day
[1:10:04] tomorrow to be together he said no right
[1:10:07] now and I said okay I said then and then
[1:10:10] you know I immediately began to just
[1:10:13] break into the scriptures go into the
[1:10:16] word was showing divine healing and its
[1:10:19] promises and that it's God's will to
[1:10:22] heal and and he heals all diseases and
[1:10:25] and and just going right down to the
[1:10:27] scriptures for the next 20 minutes half
[1:10:31] an hour or so and and the atmosphere
[1:10:34] came right and the Holy Spirit dropped
[1:10:36] down and and I cuz I was talking of
[1:10:40] healing and deliverance and I said you
[1:10:42] know brother Ron I've been right here at
[1:10:44] this very place with others where God
[1:10:47] delivered others who were dying and I
[1:10:51] was in the room with brother Gary stanky
[1:10:53] and and brother Timothy had texted me
[1:10:56] were writing another book of Acts and I
[1:10:58] was there in a moment in the time where
[1:11:01] he was a dying man and to see the Holy
[1:11:03] Spirit just turned that whole situation
[1:11:05] around
[1:11:07] in fact that's reason this church was
[1:11:09] built was on on the very things that he
[1:11:12] breathes from his very heart and that he

[1:12:43] don't worry about it no more you've got
[1:12:45] a goddess in control a man also you know
[1:12:50] brother Ron himself was dying from the
[1:12:52] burns I remind him of that really
[1:12:54] Kenneth when the doctors called the
[1:12:55] family and said he was dying his son
[1:12:58] Brian was called it from Montana Montana
[1:13:01] to the bedside of his dying father and
[1:13:04] that was Sunday and you know we went in
[1:13:07] there with the ministry here and prayed
[1:13:10] for him that day and asked him what he
[1:13:12] wanted he said well I want to be in
[1:13:13] terms for the October two meetings he
[1:13:15] was there Wednesday Thursday Friday
[1:13:17] Saturday Sunday and then the dying man's
[1:13:20] telling it still is not dead he's still
[1:13:25] alive
[1:13:33] the devil told him he would die
[1:13:35] Christmas before Christmas the devil
[1:13:37] told him he died before New Year's the
[1:13:39] devil told him he he would die before
[1:13:42] his granddaughter got married he's
[1:13:44] facing a birthday here in a couple of
[1:13:46] days the devil no doubt Toya whispered
[1:13:48] in his ears you won't live to your
[1:13:49] birthday but he's still living devil and
[1:13:53] the devil still a liar
[1:13:59] Amen the ladies were in in an adjoining
[1:14:04] room and they came in as we is about to
[1:14:06] pray I just want you to know the Holy
[1:14:09] Spirit came down and anointed us when we
[1:14:11] prayed and cursed that demon of cancer
[1:14:14] for his immune system to be anointed to
[1:14:17] seek out and to destroy this cancer I
[1:14:21] want you to notice how we prayed man and
[1:14:24] brother Donnie began to intercede in the
[1:14:27] spirit as tongues from the heavenly
[1:14:30] language began flowing from his mouth
[1:14:32] and we were charged by the Holy Ghost
[1:14:35] and we demanded that evil spirit to
[1:14:37] leave his body was a very powerful and
[1:14:40] anointed moment and as I concluded in
[1:14:44] prayer I looked up on the wall there and
[1:14:50] you know as I looked up on the wall
[1:14:53] there there was a in big letters over
[1:14:56] his office door in this room right here
[1:14:58] if you if you'd look it would been it
[1:15:03] would have would have been there right
[1:15:05] over his door is better wrote in big
[1:15:08] letters shalom and and as I looked at
[1:15:12] that I thought of this little sister
[1:15:14] Shalom from India who has contacted me
[1:15:17] for prayer and and and you know that we
[1:15:21] have written to and correspond it with
[1:15:23] and tried to you know encourage I began
[1:15:27] to pray for her and as I did I began to
[1:15:30] contemplate on that name Shalom and what
[1:15:34] it means peace peace and I began to
[1:15:38] speak peace and I began to speak
[1:15:41] her brother wrong over and over again
[1:15:45] peace peace it was very reminiscent when
[1:15:49] I was at youth camp look deep in the
[1:15:51] eyes of that demon-possessed boy and
[1:15:54] there that boy still walking in delivers
[1:15:57] today a man and I look down in his eyes
[1:16:07] and begin to speak peace to him a
[1:16:09] demon-possessed boy thereafter after a
[1:16:13] long time of of different ones praying
[1:16:16] with them and spoke peace to that and
[1:16:18] that enemy left that and all sitting
[1:16:21] that voice he just stopped and he said I
[1:16:24] look different look come over his face
[1:16:27] he says I'm free I'm free that spirit is
[1:16:30] gone and then I began to speak peace of
[1:16:39] her brother wrong and a spirit of
[1:16:42] oppression that has haunted him for
[1:16:43] weeks left him right there at that
[1:16:47] moment and peace came over him and we
[1:16:50] believe he is healed and man now that
[1:16:52] don't mean he won't have another battle
[1:16:54] but rather they healing is a process a
[1:16:57] man I preached for to his church on
[1:16:59] Saturday night who had believed our
[1:17:01] report because we've heard the doctors
[1:17:03] reports but who is believe God's report
[1:17:06] and I began to preach on what Jesus did
[1:17:09] at Calvary and in the scapegoat and and
[1:17:13] the redemption and the dual atonement
[1:17:15] for the healing for the body and
[1:17:17] salvation for the soul and Sunday night
[1:17:21] I spoke on our redemptive rights and
[1:17:24] then and then you know then that
[1:17:28] Saturday night after the meeting I found
[1:17:33] out I was ministering to Japanese and I
[1:17:36] didn't even know I was going to be
[1:17:38] ministering to Japanese little sister
[1:17:41] Angela senior doctor told us about a in
[1:17:46] a testimony the next day said of doctor
[1:17:49] you who is originally from Tokyo Japan
[1:17:52] he's been in the US for two
[1:17:55] five years he's an international
[1:17:57] correspondence affairs professor has
[1:18:00] several PhD titles and he and so he is
[1:18:05] alumni of Penn State in his top three
[1:18:08] classes and she was one you know had
[1:18:11] taken her Graduate Studies as he was one
[1:18:14] of the professors and as a philosopher
[1:18:17] he always shared you must have
[1:18:18] scientific evidence to prove anything
[1:18:21] and so um in a way they they had their
[1:18:26] in in your review and you know she she
[1:18:32] took the liberty then the classes are
[1:18:35] over so she said she shared that
[1:18:38] contradictory to many opinions that the
[1:18:42] supernatural occurred several times in
[1:18:44] history without scientific understanding
[1:18:46] and so she used several examples in the
[1:18:50] Bible like knowing the art regardless of
[1:18:52] scientific proof it rain 40 days and 40
[1:18:54] nights God shut the door not Noah
[1:18:56] another example was was Joshua and the
[1:19:00] son standing still and and so he he
[1:19:05] asked a question well I went when
[1:19:07] scientific research says that there had
[1:19:10] to be movement how could this be and she
[1:19:13] said I don't know just God did it I just
[1:19:16] know it happened and so um she before
[1:19:21] she left she told him said I'm going
[1:19:23] down to Alton Virginia to we're special
[1:19:27] friends her church family would be and
[1:19:30] said I shared a youtube link and Express
[1:19:33] you should check that link because
[1:19:35] you'll be blessed and encouraged and so
[1:19:39] during the service she starts getting
[1:19:42] her phone starts vibrating and she's and
[1:19:45] I knew it it must be urgent as my family
[1:19:48] I knew I was at church so I checked her
[1:19:52] phone and ass it was this doctor you and
[1:19:55] he had decided to check out the YouTube
[1:19:58] length and there I was preaching about
[1:20:01] Joshua stopping the Sun and we don't
[1:20:05] have to know how God did it we just know
[1:20:07] he did it
[1:20:08] we don't have to figure out how he did
[1:20:10] it we just know that God stopped the Sun
[1:20:12] you say what was it the light that God
[1:20:14] stopped or how did it happen or why
[1:20:16] didn't the earth fall or did the earth
[1:20:18] the Sun don't move the earth is what
[1:20:20] moves I said don't make it like no
[1:20:22] difference how you figure it happened
[1:20:24] all we know is that light remained there
[1:20:27] until the enemy was conquered and so as
[1:20:32] I was preaching that this man came under
[1:20:36] conviction was overwhelmed by presence
[1:20:38] that came into the room and he
[1:20:41] immediately gave his heart to the Lord
[1:20:43] hey man he was just thankful that the
[1:20:51] Lord understood him as he had never
[1:20:54] prayed and she he asked what should I do
[1:20:56] next and she replied be baptized in the
[1:20:59] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and and so
[1:21:01] you know as you know I was supposed to
[1:21:04] be leaving to minister to Japan but God
[1:21:07] had other plans and sent me on a mission
[1:21:09] and while there God saved a Japanese
[1:21:13] professor this is an incredible miracle
[1:21:17] a man this is our God at work at the
[1:21:21] time we were praying right there within
[1:21:23] the same hours as we was praying for
[1:21:27] brother Ron brother Jason Jackson not
[1:21:29] knowing we were there not knowing we
[1:21:31] were having prayer for him knew nothing
[1:21:33] about our visit there or what we were or
[1:21:36] that we were praying at that time and
[1:21:38] the Lord speaks to him and he writes a
[1:21:41] note puts the date and the time and and
[1:21:44] and he the note says brother Ron fear
[1:21:48] not
[1:21:48] don't doubt I have not forgotten my
[1:21:52] promise to you if you'll trust me I'll
[1:21:55] use you like never before
[1:21:59] amen hallelujah
[1:22:03] I asked brother Ron how he was feeling
[1:22:09] this morning he said feeling awesome but
[1:22:11] he coughed gongs step one and a big one
[1:22:14] a moon preach tonight hey man hey man I
[1:22:23] just want to tell you a few of the some
[1:22:27] of the events as you know I had been
[1:22:30] praying to the Lord about earnestly for
[1:22:33] a visitation from him looking at these
[1:22:36] walls it was like I felt like like
[1:22:40] Joshua before Jericho you remember on
[1:22:43] the on the last Sunday of December and
[1:22:48] this this caused me to preach what I did
[1:22:51] you know of as I was with Moses so will
[1:22:55] I be with you and be strong and be very
[1:22:59] courageous remember that sermon title
[1:23:01] that I preached in the end it was
[1:23:04] because I was looking at some of these
[1:23:06] walls and some of these things and I'm
[1:23:10] praying to God Lord somehow you speak to
[1:23:13] me I don't care you know just just do it
[1:23:16] you said you but pour out your spirit on
[1:23:18] all flesh your sons and daughters shall
[1:23:20] prophesy your old men will dream dreams
[1:23:23] young men will see vision and so you
[1:23:28] know I looking at that on that Sunday
[1:23:31] night after I'm ministered I have a very
[1:23:34] very vivid dream now you know God
[1:23:38] doesn't like I said give me visions I'd
[1:23:40] like I said I've had songs in the night
[1:23:43] out of out of heaven that woke me up
[1:23:46] during the night I've had audible voice
[1:23:49] of God speak to me a number of times
[1:23:51] when you know and here recently when you
[1:23:57] know when the doctor announced that that
[1:24:01] again that brother Kenneth was dying
[1:24:02] this has just been a little while ago
[1:24:05] just I'm here recently that is hearted
[1:24:08] failed and that open-heart surgery this
[1:24:11] is in November and that his heart had
[1:24:14] failed in open
[1:24:15] Serg it was his only chance or survival
[1:24:18] and so that we're contemplating to an
[1:24:21] open heart he was going in to see if
[1:24:23] they would do that and the doctors had
[1:24:26] turned him down and you know just said
[1:24:29] another heart attack you're gone you're
[1:24:31] history and they put in what 30 stents
[1:24:35] 29 30 yeah how many 32 stents enemies
[1:24:41] he's a record he's probably a bionic man
[1:24:44] and so anyway they've had that many
[1:24:47] stents as men his heart and and and I
[1:24:50] was praying on a Wednesday morning I got
[1:24:53] up and I said God we're out of showdown
[1:24:55] I said something's gonna happen I said
[1:24:59] you know Kenneth Asst he's reached a
[1:25:02] place medically they can do no nothing
[1:25:05] for him so we're at a showdown if you
[1:25:08] don't do something he's going to die so
[1:25:11] what are you gonna do about it and I was
[1:25:13] just talking to the Lord you know what
[1:25:15] are you gonna do about it
[1:25:16] and I had the voice of God came rushing
[1:25:19] back from the heavens and he said I've
[1:25:21] already done my part now what are you
[1:25:24] gonna do about it
[1:25:31] we had him come down that night we
[1:25:34] anointed with oil and rebuked that
[1:25:36] spirit he's still living today that was
[1:25:38] November now I know you know you can't
[1:25:48] be led by dreams and especially symbolic
[1:25:52] dreams you know Joseph the husband of
[1:25:55] Mary had a dream that didn't need
[1:25:56] interpreting because there was no
[1:25:58] prophet in the land then and I caution
[1:26:02] you against trying to follow every dream
[1:26:04] and you followed the word right a man
[1:26:07] and so we know Pharaoh had a symbolic
[1:26:11] dream that needed a prophet to interpret
[1:26:13] Daniel also did for Nebuchadnezzar for
[1:26:17] Pharaoh it was seven healthy fat cows
[1:26:20] that were eaten up by seven lean cows
[1:26:22] and and then seven years of corn fat and
[1:26:25] good eaten up by seventh in the ears and
[1:26:28] this meant that would be seven years of
[1:26:30] plentiful harvest eaten up by seven
[1:26:32] years of famine but it took a prophet to
[1:26:35] interpret that and we remember brother
[1:26:38] Branham had a friend his name was Bill
[1:26:41] Hall he was pastor of his church in
[1:26:43] Milltown Indiana and he came down with
[1:26:48] cancer
[1:26:48] it was liver cancer he was dying they
[1:26:51] asked brother Branham to come down and
[1:26:53] he advised him to go to the doctor said
[1:26:56] I don't have a word from the Lord but I
[1:26:57] got a good doctor friend and he called
[1:27:00] him up for him personally asked him to
[1:27:03] see this man and he said well I you know
[1:27:06] let me just look at the x-rays and he
[1:27:08] said there's nothing I can do since
[1:27:10] cancer of the liver send him over to
[1:27:12] Louisville's a certain doctor and that
[1:27:14] doctor looked at everything and sent him
[1:27:18] home to die and said you know here
[1:27:20] jaundice your you have had this now for
[1:27:23] five months and you're you're dying man
[1:27:26] you your preacher you must be ready to
[1:27:29] go and there's nothing can be done and
[1:27:33] some brother branham here gets the
[1:27:36] report even from the doctor is doctor
[1:27:38] friend said you know you're your friend
[1:27:41] is gonna cross over in four days and
[1:27:43] four days I don't give him
[1:27:44] for days and so he goes and tells the
[1:27:47] man's wife the man's you know brother
[1:27:49] halls going to die and and you know and
[1:27:52] the doctors have said for days and the
[1:27:54] Lord hasn't given me any words so you
[1:27:57] know we all got to go sometime and she
[1:27:59] started crying and and a few days later
[1:28:01] he was he was up early gonna go out
[1:28:05] hunting that morning and as he walked
[1:28:07] through the kitchen he looked and he saw
[1:28:10] on the wall a wormy
[1:28:12] green green wormy not eating knotty
[1:28:16] apple and and and he looked there and he
[1:28:20] said why would me to put that on the
[1:28:22] wall and and and then he realized he was
[1:28:26] seeing a vision and he quickly jerked
[1:28:28] his hat off and stood there and he saw
[1:28:30] five of them dropped down one after
[1:28:34] another and then he said and he saw a
[1:28:36] beautiful healthy-looking apple that
[1:28:39] came along Chomp Chomp Chomp
[1:28:42] and and ate him all up and he looked at
[1:28:46] that and said you know five months he's
[1:28:50] been sick his that's represented by the
[1:28:53] worm-eaten apples you know but God's God
[1:28:57] has shown me God's gonna heal him and
[1:28:59] God healed the man raised him up and so
[1:29:03] you know sometimes things happen in
[1:29:05] symbolic farming on Sunday night I saw
[1:29:09] um some young but mature buzzers this is
[1:29:14] very strange but I saw these young
[1:29:17] mature buzzards there I didn't count
[1:29:19] them but there was about twelve of them
[1:29:22] look like they just left the nest but
[1:29:24] hadn't learned to fly and there was a
[1:29:26] and and I was taking them and and moving
[1:29:31] them one by one into a pen of pigs and
[1:29:36] these pigs were just eating these
[1:29:38] buzzards up just you know as fast as I
[1:29:41] would put them in I could see the guts
[1:29:43] the gourds everything you know as they
[1:29:45] just shredded these buzzards apart and
[1:29:49] so you know I had been listening to the
[1:29:53] greatest battle ever fought and there
[1:29:55] was a statement brother branham made
[1:29:57] there that it
[1:29:58] stood out to me he said that there was a
[1:30:01] man that was that or a woman that was
[1:30:04] dying with with cancer or situation
[1:30:07] she's in a dying condition anyway she
[1:30:09] and the and the Lord appeared to her
[1:30:11] husband in a dream and he came back with
[1:30:14] the dream and he thought it was jokey
[1:30:16] and he cuz they come to find out it was
[1:30:18] the very answer to his wife's healing
[1:30:20] how the holy spirit did deal so Monday
[1:30:24] now I have a day of fellowship not
[1:30:26] preached all day long to brother on
[1:30:28] about the promises of healing and went
[1:30:31] over you know about you know our rights
[1:30:34] as a believer our legal rights are all
[1:30:37] of these things and just spent the day
[1:30:39] in the word with him on Tuesday morning
[1:30:42] we were to go to the hospital and to
[1:30:45] find out the news and the treatment
[1:30:47] plans and and then we were to fly out or
[1:30:51] at home um 2:40 in the afternoon and so
[1:30:56] that just I didn't know that he would be
[1:30:58] going for this appointment for it left
[1:31:00] but the Lord just arranged it so I could
[1:31:02] be there with him and in the middle of
[1:31:04] the night in the middle of the night I
[1:31:07] had an experience of waking up and I I
[1:31:11] heard the song being sung here I was
[1:31:16] singing it Bob but whatever it was me
[1:31:18] and sung as I as I came to and I heard
[1:31:22] it as as I was there awake we shall see
[1:31:27] miracles we shall see Giants fall we
[1:31:33] shall walk on water and so you know I
[1:31:38] got up that morning and was greeted by
[1:31:42] sister Connie as I poured the water into
[1:31:46] the coffee pot and I see asked how her
[1:31:50] night was and I and I said well ours was
[1:31:53] fine I said but if it's any consolation
[1:31:56] to you I woke up during the night he
[1:31:59] singing or here in the song I really I
[1:32:02] don't know if I was singing or whether I
[1:32:04] was hearing it's but it was saying we
[1:32:06] shall see miracles and she was she
[1:32:09] started crying she burst into tea
[1:32:12] and she said mother Tim we were up at
[1:32:15] 2:30 in the morning I was back in the
[1:32:17] bath room and this is on the back side
[1:32:19] of the house with several rooms between
[1:32:22] us no way that you could hear we had a
[1:32:24] fan going on in our room where you
[1:32:26] couldn't hear anything any noise that
[1:32:29] was going on we had a we had a fan for
[1:32:32] noise maker and and she says I was
[1:32:36] singing that Stas just started singing
[1:32:38] this song we shall see miracles real
[1:32:41] softly to myself we shall see Giants
[1:32:43] fall will walk on water and so he just
[1:32:47] confirmed it to her we started on the
[1:32:50] way the doctor to discuss his plan and I
[1:32:54] was riding along and all of a sudden a
[1:32:56] dream come back to me I'd told my wife
[1:32:58] about it the night before and I dreamed
[1:33:00] came back to me I've seen those buzzards
[1:33:03] and feeding those buzzers to pigs and
[1:33:07] all of a sudden it just came to me the
[1:33:09] brother branham told us and it's the
[1:33:11] first I think it's the first place in
[1:33:14] diseases and afflictions of first search
[1:33:16] on buzzards he said in a cancer in the
[1:33:20] natural and the spiritual he's a devil
[1:33:22] he types a scavenger and a buzzard he
[1:33:24] eats dead things so now I you know all
[1:33:31] of a sudden I knew this dream had some
[1:33:33] significance and brother Rocco brother
[1:33:35] honor said them buzzards
[1:33:37] there were cancers and I was feeding
[1:33:39] them to pigs and so you know then and
[1:33:44] then I was puzzled why of what the pigs
[1:33:46] meant so I was kind of silent for the
[1:33:48] next ride into into the doctors and then
[1:33:52] that sitting in the in the hospital and
[1:33:55] I was searching scan through nearly 200
[1:33:59] quotes on pigs I couldn't find a clue in
[1:34:01] the sermons but well you know what but
[1:34:04] when the doctors was talking about
[1:34:05] treatments and use an immunotherapy I
[1:34:09] did a I did an internet search on cancer
[1:34:14] and immunotherapy and pigs and found
[1:34:17] that they developed this in a min of a
[1:34:20] therapy using small pigs like I saw in
[1:34:22] the dream in fact to the matter
[1:34:25] is I just read a document error a
[1:34:27] document on it said porcine cancer
[1:34:30] models the value of big cancer models of
[1:34:34] obviously depends on how faithfully they
[1:34:37] represent human disease porcine cancer
[1:34:41] biology is still a new field but
[1:34:44] indications are the pigs can correctly
[1:34:46] mimic human cancers and so you know they
[1:34:51] they were being fed to pigs and the pigs
[1:34:54] were gobbling them up and there was
[1:34:57] about 12 of them and I fed them one
[1:35:00] about a dozen but I was fed them to
[1:35:03] about a dozen pigs one by one just see
[1:35:06] him chopping them up now there's to be
[1:35:09] about 12 treatments and after them he
[1:35:12] will have a PET scan and I'm asking you
[1:35:15] to agree with me and believe with me for
[1:35:18] this PET scan it's going to come back
[1:35:20] off clear completely well
[1:35:25] i'ma know
[1:35:31] this is all biblical you know in the
[1:35:34] Bible legions of devils for cast out of
[1:35:37] a man and went into pigs and the pigs
[1:35:40] hadn't took them Devils to the sea and
[1:35:42] drown them a man and as far as a man he
[1:35:46] was restored his family healthy and well
[1:35:48] hey man so we got scriptural evidence
[1:35:52] amen amen
[1:36:02] now brother Branham said in the
[1:36:06] uncertain sound he's a now don't teach
[1:36:09] this but you know in the beginning when
[1:36:11] God made him he didn't make him to be
[1:36:13] doctored he had his own doctrine in him
[1:36:17] and remember I prayed that God would
[1:36:19] anoint his immune system and he was
[1:36:24] equipped he was a unit of his own here
[1:36:27] then healin does not come from any
[1:36:28] outside resource it comes from the
[1:36:31] inside now we can take the outside aids
[1:36:34] such as to kill germs or whatever it is
[1:36:36] in us or we can take our hands and cut
[1:36:39] on each other and make take a piece out
[1:36:41] or something like that an appendix or
[1:36:43] bad tooth or something take it out but
[1:36:45] healing does not come from anything you
[1:36:47] apply healing only comes by the power
[1:36:50] that's within yourself to build back to
[1:36:52] tissue that's been torn from the place
[1:36:54] has been taken out of there for healing
[1:36:57] is in you now I'm going to conclude as
[1:37:03] we come down here we were we were
[1:37:08] contacted again by this sister Angela
[1:37:13] because on that I believe it was on
[1:37:18] Tuesday morning that she received a
[1:37:21] phone call and she received a phone call
[1:37:24] from a an elite executive Sales Director
[1:37:30] who is Catholic by faith
[1:37:33] she doesn't participate in social media
[1:37:36] but she had a dream and she clearly said
[1:37:40] she clearly saw her in that dream
[1:37:43] so she knew she was connected somehow
[1:37:45] and this so moved on this woman said
[1:37:49] that she called her early in the morning
[1:37:52] said I saw you in a dream and then the
[1:37:55] dream that was a couple that was sitting
[1:37:56] on a sofa or couch in this answered the
[1:38:00] descriptions as she described it it
[1:38:03] matched sister Connie and brother Ron
[1:38:04] there was a gentleman that was speaking
[1:38:06] to him and he stated to them you did
[1:38:10] your part now we'll do mine and the
[1:38:14] dream faded and she began to hear a song
[1:38:16] and she woke up hearing this song did
[1:38:20] she never heard before and she's
[1:38:22] Catholic and she sees and she's a she
[1:38:27] religiously she's not super religious
[1:38:30] but she starts hearing this song and she
[1:38:32] starts humming the tune to sister Angela
[1:38:37] on the phone and said it was going like
[1:38:40] this way make a miracle-worker
[1:38:44] promise keep her
[1:38:49] mob dog
[1:38:52] hallelujah a man a woman who had never
[1:38:56] ever heard the song begins to hear it
[1:38:58] sung from another dimension a man now
[1:39:03] you say how can that be brother Tim well
[1:39:05] cuz He pours out his spirit on all flesh
[1:39:09] hey man so therefore as we're looking
[1:39:13] here you say well I just can't get it
[1:39:15] brother Tim it's a Catholic woman not
[1:39:17] super religious let me just say I don't
[1:39:20] care if God speaks through a donkey a
[1:39:22] man just I didn't speak however he wants
[1:39:25] to speak a man but I say at the same
[1:39:29] time let's get in the position where God
[1:39:32] can speak through us hey man hey man god
[1:39:37] bless you
[1:39:38] alright now I hadn't even started
[1:39:43] preaching yet hope you're not in too big
[1:39:48] a hurry thank you brother
[1:39:52] we're going to be speaking to this from
[1:39:55] this morning on the abstract title deed
[1:40:01] in this scene we see a book that is
[1:40:06] sealed with seven seals it is a book of
[1:40:11] a title but none can claim it it's a
[1:40:16] deed to a land but no man is worthy who
[1:40:19] can take it and so there's steps for the
[1:40:22] lamb who stands up to take the book and
[1:40:28] what it contains is the title to
[1:40:30] everything that Adam lost in the fall
[1:40:33] and and of course we know that
[1:40:37] originally that Adam on the earth he was
[1:40:41] a God of the earth and but he would
[1:40:44] forfeit that title deed to it to Satan
[1:40:47] and and of course as we know that he was
[1:40:51] like an amateur God over the earth the
[1:40:53] earth was his everything was given to
[1:40:57] his hand and through his fall Satan then
[1:41:00] would become the Prince of this world
[1:41:02] and he would also become the pen
[1:41:04] ^ atmospheres or prince of the power of
[1:41:09] the air and in the fall adam forfeited
[1:41:13] the title deed - that he would forfeit
[1:41:16] it over to Satan
[1:41:18] but Satan does not rightfully own the
[1:41:21] earth and he doesn't rightfully own you
[1:41:25] but he but of course he can possess it
[1:41:29] but it's only for a time and is only by
[1:41:32] permission and of course it's because
[1:41:36] that man is out of his rightful place
[1:41:39] and so he lost the title to it but
[1:41:44] Satan's dirty hands could not take it so
[1:41:47] it went back in the hands of Almighty
[1:41:49] God now title is the holy evidence that
[1:41:53] gives rise to a legal right of
[1:41:55] possession or control and in Eden none
[1:42:00] forfeited the title deed to the earth
[1:42:03] and to Satan and in order to do this and
[1:42:08] doing so he lost the title even to his
[1:42:11] own body and and his solver Satan would
[1:42:15] take a hold of his body his spirit and
[1:42:18] the soul of man and corrupt him and and
[1:42:23] man was robbed of his faith and now he
[1:42:26] would live by fear his body which was
[1:42:30] made to be in the image of God was was
[1:42:34] now by a false life by deceit he was
[1:42:39] robbed of his health and he was robbed
[1:42:42] of his eternal life and it became a
[1:42:45] slave and the property of Satan his body
[1:42:49] which never needed medicine never was
[1:42:51] sick never had a headache never stomach
[1:42:55] problem now became the target of demons
[1:42:58] and evil spirits could now take up
[1:43:01] residence in the body that once only
[1:43:05] housed the Son of God and the Fellowship
[1:43:08] of the Holy Spirit and now his body was
[1:43:11] to decay to turn gray and old and feeble
[1:43:16] until it's brought
[1:43:17] back to the dust of the earth we like to
[1:43:21] point into you to Genesis 3:17 re part
[1:43:24] of verse 17 Kirsten is the ground for
[1:43:27] thy sake in sorrow shalt I eat them in
[1:43:30] all the days of thy life verse 18 thorns
[1:43:33] also and thistles shall it bring forth
[1:43:35] to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of
[1:43:38] the field now sadly not only would the
[1:43:42] land grow thorns and thistles
[1:43:45] but man's body was also made from the
[1:43:48] dust of the ground and that body would
[1:43:51] also grow thorns and thistles and Men
[1:43:55] tormentors that would come and torment
[1:43:58] his body evil spirits that could now
[1:44:01] attack in what had been once an immortal
[1:44:05] body now turned mortal and with that
[1:44:08] mortal it would become corrupted by by
[1:44:12] demon powers in spirits that would it
[1:44:16] would grow now thorns and thistles
[1:44:18] subject to disease and sickness and even
[1:44:22] death and of course the man's mind the
[1:44:25] human spirit became corrupted its memory
[1:44:29] which only remembered God's Word and
[1:44:32] contained God's promise now would become
[1:44:34] defiled his imagination from which man's
[1:44:38] comes man's creativity that ability to
[1:44:42] use imagination to develop to use I
[1:44:45] order to develop new and original ideas
[1:44:49] or things became evil its conscious now
[1:44:53] became aware of nakedness and shame and
[1:44:57] was stripped of its purity its
[1:45:00] affections and feelings and desires that
[1:45:03] were that had been settled things above
[1:45:06] now became said upon temporal and
[1:45:09] central things where that pass away and
[1:45:13] man's power of reasoning that power of
[1:45:18] logical thinking in order to draw
[1:45:20] conclusions and the once only contained
[1:45:24] God in his and reason to purity and
[1:45:26] holiness
[1:45:28] and it began to dwarf and shrivel and
[1:45:30] now man began to have thoughts that
[1:45:33] Satan interjected into his mind and God
[1:45:39] comes down looking for his son and finds
[1:45:42] him beaten and whipped and deformed and
[1:45:46] robbed of his inheritance but there was
[1:45:50] one thing that Satan could not put a
[1:45:53] claim on and that was that predestinated
[1:45:56] see gene of God that was resident within
[1:46:00] him inside of his soul so in spite of
[1:46:03] all the claims the devil had on him God
[1:46:05] has a claim on all of us as well and you
[1:46:10] see that that seed gene of God was clods
[1:46:13] those names that was in his book so the
[1:46:17] book of title deed was now in question
[1:46:20] after who owned it and Satan had a claim
[1:46:24] on him because Adam had subjected his
[1:46:27] self to it I'd to Satan on there and
[1:46:30] become subservient to him but yet God
[1:46:34] had a claim because he was the original
[1:46:37] owner and he had the first claim a man
[1:46:41] that the earth was originally his right
[1:46:45] and then you were originally his I like
[1:46:48] to tell the devil I've never originally
[1:46:51] belonged to you a man I wasn't yours to
[1:46:56] possess I belong to God before a world
[1:47:00] was ever began he chose me in him before
[1:47:03] the foundation of the world and Satan's
[1:47:07] dirty hands could not take this book so
[1:47:11] it went back in the hands of the
[1:47:13] original owner which is God before the
[1:47:16] fall man was a dual person he was
[1:47:19] connected to the earth because he had a
[1:47:22] physical body but he was connected to
[1:47:24] the heaven because he had a soul and so
[1:47:28] there when one with one round he he
[1:47:32] contacted and lived in heaven and he
[1:47:35] operated and he brought heaven Downs
[1:47:38] remains of the
[1:47:39] faith in the Word of God he would bring
[1:47:41] heaven down to the earth and he would
[1:47:44] control the natures of the animals and
[1:47:47] there was a millennium as a lion would
[1:47:49] lay down like the lamb and and would eat
[1:47:51] straw like the Bullock and there there
[1:47:55] was there the great powers laid within
[1:47:58] him as a said to move things on earth
[1:48:01] from Heaven's Dominion and and so but
[1:48:06] when this sin came in they became a
[1:48:08] great chasm between God and man and
[1:48:13] their fellowship but I want you to know
[1:48:15] that our God is a determined God and man
[1:48:19] he doesn't give up easily
[1:48:21] and he won't let the devil have the
[1:48:24] upper hand for long a man but you see if
[1:48:29] he has a son he then will redeem that
[1:48:32] son that son cannot be lost from him
[1:48:36] forever they don't get ought to give you
[1:48:39] some hope for your loved ones this
[1:48:40] morning
[1:48:41] they can't be lost from him forever a
[1:48:44] man so God was determined said I will
[1:48:48] not allow Satan to be victorious this is
[1:48:52] my son and I will redeem him and in the
[1:48:57] very moment Alice he is sent out of the
[1:49:00] garden and there they are oh you know
[1:49:03] whipped and defeated and the only way
[1:49:05] they can have a conference with God is
[1:49:08] for there to be a death a
[1:49:09] substitutionary death in their place and
[1:49:12] a lamb or some animal had to die and his
[1:49:15] skins now would be draped over them a
[1:49:17] bloody skin as they go out of the garden
[1:49:21] with her shoulders bent and weeping to
[1:49:24] one another has a walk out of the carton
[1:49:26] and garden watching the mouse he goes as
[1:49:30] they go it all formed down into one
[1:49:34] great thing God's great love began to
[1:49:38] move within him and he said but I won't
[1:49:40] let you go along
[1:49:43] I want you to get that point this
[1:49:46] morning I will not let you go alone but
[1:49:50] I'll go with you and I will be a seed in
[1:49:54] that that I come through the woman and I
[1:49:58] will redeem you from what the serpent
[1:50:00] has done and I'll bruise his head hey
[1:50:04] man I will bruise his head and he and he
[1:50:08] will bruise my heel word I walk upon the
[1:50:11] earth in my humanity
[1:50:13] so you Adam Adam you've been robbed and
[1:50:16] cast into Satan's prison house but you
[1:50:19] were born to be free
[1:50:21] and man you are now in bondage the Satan
[1:50:25] but I'll tell you what I'm not gonna
[1:50:27] allow this to happen I will provide an
[1:50:31] attorney for you a man son we're gonna
[1:50:34] have a day in court that's what you're
[1:50:37] seeing in Revelation 5 is a day in court
[1:50:40] a man there is a throne there is a king
[1:50:44] there is an intercessor a mediator an
[1:50:47] attorney and then there is a question
[1:50:51] document in question a man and then he
[1:50:55] says we're gonna have a day in court
[1:50:57] right now the ownership of the a man and
[1:51:00] earth is in question but the judge will
[1:51:03] hold the question title in escrow until
[1:51:07] it is determined before the judgment
[1:51:11] throne after who owns it now escrow is
[1:51:16] money or property or deed that's our
[1:51:18] bond is put into the property or the
[1:51:22] custody of a third party to go for
[1:51:25] delivery to a grantee only until after
[1:51:28] the fulfilment of the conditions
[1:51:30] specified and so in this case the title
[1:51:33] deed was put in the custody of the judge
[1:51:36] for delivery to a man who was worthy
[1:51:41] notice he would have to be a man who was
[1:51:45] worthy a man without sin am I now as God
[1:51:51] he had it
[1:51:53] but now it's got to be transferred back
[1:51:55] to a man again
[1:51:57] because it was not God who lost the
[1:52:00] title its man who lost the title and man
[1:52:03] then we gotta bring man back to the
[1:52:05] condition from where he fell from I'm
[1:52:08] man because when he fell all of the
[1:52:10] earth fell with him because he was the
[1:52:13] king of the earth animal life vegetation
[1:52:16] everything would fall with him and the
[1:52:19] only way to bring that back to a
[1:52:20] millennium again was restore man back to
[1:52:22] his original condition so the very
[1:52:26] purpose and plan of God is to take man
[1:52:29] who has fallen and put him back to the
[1:52:32] place before the fall are you with me
[1:52:35] amen brother buddy here he would show an
[1:52:38] Eden until I can come as a man and take
[1:52:42] that because I'm going to come a man
[1:52:44] there will be a man who will be a
[1:52:46] serpent brucer as I seed the seed and
[1:52:49] the woman will bruise his head there's
[1:52:51] going to be a seed that comes through
[1:52:53] the woman coming through the woman
[1:52:56] brings death through the woman brings
[1:52:58] life and through this woman now through
[1:53:02] through through Mary will come a son a
[1:53:07] man it will be the very body of Almighty
[1:53:11] God God would create himself a body a
[1:53:14] man now God as you see Jesus could not
[1:53:19] be his own father and man so he would
[1:53:23] have to be a body created formed of God
[1:53:28] but it mean that God couldn't be his own
[1:53:31] son Amen so God would create a body a
[1:53:36] son and this would be the title of his a
[1:53:38] son it's an offspring is a creation of
[1:53:41] God and God would come and take on flesh
[1:53:44] they meant to become the intercessor the
[1:53:49] attorney a man the Redeemer Alleluia
[1:53:55] a man so here as a down payment he said
[1:53:59] I'll tell you what we'll do and he took
[1:54:01] him through a lamb and he through a
[1:54:03] bloody skin to Adam and said come
[1:54:05] with this for this is a first step of
[1:54:07] redemption but this is going to be a
[1:54:10] process but I promise you I will redeem
[1:54:14] my son back to his original inheritance
[1:54:19] I've got some good news for you this
[1:54:22] morning
[1:54:23] we are not back over here in the
[1:54:26] beginning we're sin entered in and one
[1:54:29] man fell but we're right here in the
[1:54:31] hour of redemption where there is a
[1:54:33] people to walk for back a man from
[1:54:36] mortal battle mortality there they move
[1:54:39] from immortality to mortality but we're
[1:54:42] not there anymore we're right here at
[1:54:45] the end
[1:54:48] hallelujah we're at the very place where
[1:54:50] there is a people that is promised in
[1:54:53] the word to move from being mortal batei
[1:54:56] immortality these disputed title now
[1:55:07] remains in the hands of God until a
[1:55:10] worthy man takes the book but there
[1:55:13] isn't a man that is worthy all is all
[1:55:18] man is unworthy so we see the picture
[1:55:23] now now Jesus is not a lamb with seven
[1:55:29] horns and seven eyes that is symbolic of
[1:55:32] him he's not a woolly creature and man
[1:55:37] not me or else we would show you a
[1:55:40] picture of the lamb with 7-hour and
[1:55:42] seven eyes as they behold your God fall
[1:55:45] down and works and we're not either
[1:55:46] we're not idol worshippers this is
[1:55:49] symbolic a man of his redeeming work so
[1:55:56] that we wouldn't get confused because if
[1:56:01] we have seen if we'd to see one on the
[1:56:03] throne and another man over here we
[1:56:06] would have thought there were two gods
[1:56:08] but at the very one on the throne
[1:56:11] becomes a
[1:56:14] he creates himself a body and the father
[1:56:18] comes and dwells in the Sun for the
[1:56:20] purpose of redemption
[1:56:23] hallelujah not another God the same God
[1:56:26] moving right down to Eternity to take on
[1:56:30] amen your afflictions to go through your
[1:56:34] sorrows to feel how you feel do
[1:56:37] experience what you experience so he
[1:56:40] could be a proper mediator and prove
[1:56:43] himself worthy and without sin so he
[1:56:46] could take as a man take the book back
[1:56:49] for a man Oh hallelujah that makes me
[1:56:53] feel like speaking in tongues hallelujah
[1:56:56] just about lose words to express myself
[1:57:00] but now there's no man worthy so God
[1:57:04] steps out of eternity to become a man in
[1:57:08] order to take the book but once it's
[1:57:11] taken is still a book that is sealed and
[1:57:15] it cannot be open until the seals are
[1:57:18] removed and the removing of it seals the
[1:57:22] lots are the giving of it in the
[1:57:25] abstract because the seals represent
[1:57:30] something that's keeping the book closed
[1:57:32] to man and then heritance being able to
[1:57:37] be open to them are you with me
[1:57:40] so the removing of its seals are given
[1:57:43] an abstract of title that means it's
[1:57:47] there it requires a title search and so
[1:57:52] it will give an abstract of title which
[1:57:55] is a brief history of other transfers of
[1:58:00] a piece of land including all the claims
[1:58:02] that could be made against it so again
[1:58:05] you know there would be a search a title
[1:58:09] search and with this title search going
[1:58:13] back and and saying seeing as it moved
[1:58:16] down from this one to this one did this
[1:58:18] one to this one it would have to strike
[1:58:20] all the claims that were against it
[1:58:25] we'll all have to be struck off and paid
[1:58:28] for hey man hey if you're going to go
[1:58:33] sell a piece of property and there's a
[1:58:35] lien on it man you may own the deed to
[1:58:40] it and man but somebody else has got a
[1:58:45] claim on it and we've got promises
[1:58:49] laying right here in the word but
[1:58:54] there's a devil standing up there and
[1:58:56] saying but he can't take it he can't
[1:59:00] have it he's not worthy he can't have a
[1:59:03] rapture in this day their claims against
[1:59:06] him their claims against this church
[1:59:09] there's a claim against the bride and
[1:59:12] they've all got to be cancelled
[1:59:17] everything that's kept a rapture from
[1:59:20] taking place has got to be dealt with
[1:59:25] hallelujah I'm corrected they meant by
[1:59:29] the blood of the Lamb and shown that now
[1:59:33] the title is free and clear
[1:59:37] hallelujah so that's why we can see in
[1:59:40] Revelation 10 a transfer of the title
[1:59:44] when John could look at it
[1:59:46] John wasn't worthy John could not touch
[1:59:49] it John could not take it but now after
[1:59:52] the lamb pays the price and he cancels
[1:59:56] the death here's somebody with me did
[1:59:59] John his throat go and take the little
[2:00:01] book out of the hand of the angel now
[2:00:06] the book is yours oh I'll tell you
[2:00:12] that's why I believe we're living we're
[2:00:14] living in the day and the hour where the
[2:00:16] seals have been taken off the book and
[2:00:19] God is commanding the people now go take
[2:00:22] the little book out of the hand of the
[2:00:25] angel go and take your possession you've
[2:00:29] got an abstracted title it's not a
[2:00:33] closed book anymore it's an open book
[2:00:39] every claim against it is struck off now
[2:00:49] the book is the title the opening of the
[2:00:54] seals will give the abstract of titled
[2:00:58] showing that all the claims against it
[2:01:02] struck off so before the book of title
[2:01:06] can be opened by the lambs the seals
[2:01:09] have to be removed and so there had to
[2:01:12] be a title search so the lamb will work
[2:01:16] through his agent are you with me ma'am
[2:01:20] because he'll tear the seals off and
[2:01:22] hand it down to the seventh angel on
[2:01:24] earth where do you get that brother damn
[2:01:26] revelations in seven just put it up
[2:01:27] there for observation I found that in
[2:01:30] the days of voice of his sound in the
[2:01:32] midst of God to be finished and when the
[2:01:35] seals would be opened the thunders would
[2:01:37] be revealed the voiceless he kept giving
[2:01:40] us the revelation of the mysteries that
[2:01:43] were only in symbol form
[2:01:45] hallelujah exactly that could parallel
[2:01:48] the days of
[2:01:49] and you will you have written air and
[2:01:52] unknown town symbols many many tackle
[2:01:55] your Farsi but there comes a time where
[2:01:58] a prophet comes on the scene after
[2:02:00] everybody else is just about it the
[2:02:03] illusions our guest about it man I wrote
[2:02:06] books about it
[2:02:07] hallelujah but in this day God doesn't
[2:02:10] send another theologian but God sends a
[2:02:13] profit and that profit has the Word of
[2:02:16] God and he looks at the symbols and he
[2:02:18] says this is what they are Daniel would
[2:02:22] say many many technical arts and give
[2:02:24] the interpretation hallelujah and that's
[2:02:28] what God did for us in this day an hour
[2:02:30] and then there was a white horse and the
[2:02:32] rider we didn't know who it was and a
[2:02:34] red horse and we didn't know who it was
[2:02:36] black and we didn't know what it meant
[2:02:38] and a pale horse and souls under the
[2:02:41] altar and on and on and on and on you go
[2:02:45] and in days gone bad man gets about it
[2:02:49] but we're no longer guessing we have a
[2:02:53] vindicated word Bob vindicated prophet
[2:02:57] with a vindicated voice with a
[2:02:59] vindicated message hallelujah a man of
[2:03:04] God
[2:03:08] so the agent on earth starts all the way
[2:03:13] back in Ephesus and he does a title
[2:03:16] search all the way to Laodicea looking
[2:03:19] for all the claims of satan had against
[2:03:21] the church the first organization that
[2:03:25] rose the niccola and in spirit they're
[2:03:29] wrong and the Trinity of three God's
[2:03:33] Trinity is not even in the Bible amen a
[2:03:38] false baptism a Father Son and Holy
[2:03:43] Ghost that's a false baptism there's
[2:03:47] only one name given under heaven whereby
[2:03:49] men must be saved and man there's only
[2:03:55] one in his name is remission of sins if
[2:04:00] you want sins remitted it must be you
[2:04:02] must be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:04:05] Jesus Christ nobody and all the Bible
[2:04:08] was ever baptized any other way until
[2:04:11] theologians come along and mess with the
[2:04:16] deed and put a claim against it but I
[2:04:21] want you in this knowing this day
[2:04:23] friends and we got a clear deed all the
[2:04:27] things down to the ages that man is
[2:04:30] tacked on and the Antichrist period of
[2:04:32] the white the red the black double the
[2:04:34] pale horse rider would put their seal
[2:04:37] and close the book now it is not a
[2:04:39] closed book anymore it is an open book
[2:04:43] and the land is yours not only have you
[2:04:49] got a deed now but you have an abstract
[2:04:52] shoe the need and you can read clearly
[2:04:57] in the word what is yours and possess it
[2:05:00] [Music]
[2:05:02] now the land is yours the Covenant is
[2:05:08] the deed to it but the enemy that
[2:05:11] possesses it in his claims against you
[2:05:14] must be struck off somebody with me now
[2:05:20] now this and we're just gonna just turn
[2:05:24] just a little bit here so catch me as we
[2:05:26] make this little Junction this is true
[2:05:29] of Israel now remember they are our type
[2:05:34] we are the Anna type we're not typing
[2:05:36] them they're typing us they were
[2:05:38] foreshadowing us so God would use Israel
[2:05:41] to show what he would do in his people
[2:05:44] there right and so the land is yours of
[2:05:48] course and the Covenant is is the deed
[2:05:51] to to it but the enemy possess it like
[2:05:54] Israel they were given a covenant they
[2:05:57] were given the rights they were given
[2:06:00] the title to the land on Mount Sinai
[2:06:04] cannot stop here just for a minute
[2:06:07] amen because really Mount Sinai was 50
[2:06:11] days after the Passover it was the first
[2:06:14] Pentecost it is here that the Jews will
[2:06:17] tell you they they they say God made a
[2:06:20] covenant with Israel therefore he
[2:06:22] married her it was seven weeks after
[2:06:26] they had left the land a promise and
[2:06:29] after the Passover and then then they
[2:06:32] without this Jubilee which was a given
[2:06:35] of the rights the title to the land on
[2:06:37] Mount Sinai and there are seven nations
[2:06:42] I would like you to look here
[2:06:43] Deuteronomy 7 1 and when the Lord our
[2:06:47] good that God shall bring thee into the
[2:06:50] land whither thou goest to possess it
[2:06:53] and it's cast out many nation before
[2:06:55] thee the Hittites the girgashites the
[2:06:59] amorite the Canaanites the parasites the
[2:07:03] hive eyes and the jebusites
[2:07:06] seven nations greater and mightier than
[2:07:10] thou so I want you to notice now the
[2:07:14] land is possessed by seven nations
[2:07:21] hours the history of the title has come
[2:07:25] through seven churches each one of them
[2:07:30] with the claim on the land all of these
[2:07:35] nations were claiming the lands we have
[2:07:39] been there longer than you
[2:07:40] we are the first church our our Pope was
[2:07:46] the first pope Peter on and on and on
[2:07:50] they have their claims that goes up many
[2:07:53] many years seven Church ages and they
[2:07:59] have had claims on the land and they are
[2:08:01] their own the land but there comes a
[2:08:05] time where God says he says I am going
[2:08:08] to just possess you and man I am going
[2:08:14] to dis possess everything except my
[2:08:17] royal seed I've let others camp on this
[2:08:22] land and through the ages there have
[2:08:25] been Baptists there have been Methodists
[2:08:27] there have been Presbyterians there have
[2:08:29] been Catholics and in their time they
[2:08:32] you know God a week did their English
[2:08:35] and he saved them even under their times
[2:08:38] of a confusion because God is a God
[2:08:42] rich in mercy but there comes a time
[2:08:45] where God says you've got to now come to
[2:08:49] this word because I'm going to dis
[2:08:52] possess out of this land
[2:08:54] everything except those names who are in
[2:08:58] the Lamb's Book of Life that ROI you'll
[2:09:00] see them Abraham numbers 33 53 and ye
[2:09:08] shall dispossessed the inhabitants of
[2:09:11] the land and dwell there here for I have
[2:09:15] given you the land to possess it so God
[2:09:19] would tell them I give you the land now
[2:09:22] listen
[2:09:23] but you've got to go clear it
[2:09:27] you have the deed to it but there's got
[2:09:30] to be a clearing of the deed there's got
[2:09:34] to be removal of the claims of these
[2:09:38] other nations on the land but I'm giving
[2:09:42] you the whole land and it's yours to
[2:09:45] possess but you're gonna have to
[2:09:47] dispossessed them but you're not gonna
[2:09:51] do this by yourself and you're not gonna
[2:09:55] do this by your own power hallelujah
[2:09:59] Exodus 23 24 I sent an angel before thee
[2:10:04] you're not going alone hallelujah that's
[2:10:09] gonna be a mighty angel hallelujah
[2:10:13] mighty angel that's gonna descend and
[2:10:16] this mighty angel will go before thee to
[2:10:21] keep thee in the way others have strayed
[2:10:25] others have missed the mark
[2:10:28] others have fell short of the goal
[2:10:30] others have missed the rapture but not
[2:10:33] your age you are predestinated not to
[2:10:37] fall because I am sending an angel
[2:10:40] before thee to keep the end the way
[2:10:44] hallelujah and not only will I keep you
[2:10:47] in the way but I'm gonna bring you I'm
[2:10:51] gonna bring you I'm gonna gather you I'm
[2:10:55] gonna pull you out of every denomination
[2:10:56] I'm gonna take you right out of Egypt
[2:10:59] I'm gonna take you out of Satan slavery
[2:11:02] I'm gonna bring you into this land of
[2:11:04] promise
[2:11:08] hallelujah I'm gonna bring you into the
[2:11:11] place which I have prepared a prepared
[2:11:17] place God has a prepared place and a
[2:11:23] prepared position for us here in this
[2:11:27] last day
[2:11:28] now welcome verse 21 my name is in him
[2:11:32] so therefore there has to be a
[2:11:35] revelation of his name amen and then
[2:11:39] we'll not only is there people who have
[2:11:43] the revelation of that name but they
[2:11:46] have the authority and the permission to
[2:11:49] use that name that does one over you
[2:11:55] like a judge I said that not only would
[2:12:02] he give you give you his name my name is
[2:12:05] in him but also he would give you the
[2:12:09] authority to use that name in my name
[2:12:16] you will cast out devils what are you
[2:12:19] asking my name I will do it whatever you
[2:12:25] bind on earth I'll bind it in heaven

[2:12:31] heaven

[2:12:39] talking to third Pole believers I'm
[2:12:42] talking about people there who know
[2:12:44] their God and shadowy exploits

[2:12:52] enemies and an adversary unto thine
[2:12:55] adversary now you know I want to go back
[2:13:01] to verse 21 and I'm gonna read two parts

[2:13:12] voice and do all that I speak now then
[2:13:17] you know many of us right there heart
[2:13:19] just dropped
[2:13:21] because we know that humanly speaking is
[2:13:24] impossible to do this but the deal of
[2:13:29] the new covenant is different from the
[2:13:32] old covenant because in the new covenant
[2:13:36] he says I'll put a new heart and a new
[2:13:38] to spirit in you I'll give you a new
[2:13:40] desire and a desire to do right but I'm
[2:13:44] gonna do more than that for you in the
[2:13:46] new covenant I'm gonna put my spirit in
[2:13:48] you and I will cause you to walk in my
[2:13:53] statutes and do them and you shall keep
[2:13:56] my judgments and statutes not by your
[2:13:59] own power but by the power of the Holy
[2:14:02] Ghost on the inside of you therefore I

[2:29:29] perfect he tells you to be perfect
