[43:41] tonight
[43:42] if you have your Bibles with you tonight
[43:44] and you'd like to turn with me to the
[43:46] Book of John the 14th chapter
[43:48] and the ninth verse
[43:53] we're going to read down through the
[43:54] 20th verse and then we'll look over in
[43:56] Matthew 5 for a short reading there as
[43:59] well
[44:03] John 14 and 9.
[44:06] it says Jesus saith unto him have I been
[44:09] so long with you and yet hast thou not
[44:11] known me Philip
[44:13] he that has seen me has seen the father
[44:15] and how sayeth thou then show us the
[44:18] father
[44:19] believeth thou not that I am in the
[44:21] father and the father in me the words
[44:24] that I speak unto you I speak not of
[44:26] myself but the father that dwelleth in
[44:28] me he doeth the works this is something
[44:32] that we're going to key on tonight is
[44:34] that he doeth the works believe me that
[44:37] I am in the father and the father in me
[44:39] or else believe me for the very work's
[44:41] sake verily verily I say unto you he
[44:44] that believeth on me the works that I do
[44:46] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[44:49] thee shall he do because I go unto my
[44:53] father and whatsoever you shall ask in
[44:56] my name that will I do that the father
[44:57] may be glorified in the son if you shall
[45:00] ask anything in my name I will do it
[45:04] if you love me keep my Commandments and
[45:07] I will pray the father and he shall give
[45:09] you another comforter that he may abide
[45:11] with you forever even the spirit of
[45:13] Truth who the world cannot receive
[45:15] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[45:17] him but ye know him for he dwelleth with
[45:20] you and shall be in you I will not leave
[45:23] you comfortless I will come to you yet a
[45:26] little while in the world seeth me no
[45:28] more but ye see me because I live you
[45:31] shall live also at that day you shall
[45:34] know that I am in the father and ye and
[45:37] me and I in you we're also going to look
[45:40] over in the Book of Matthew the fifth
[45:42] chapter in the 14th verse
[45:44] we're just going to read three verses
[45:46] here before we let you have your seats
[45:48] it says ye are the light of the world a
[45:52] city that is set on a hill cannot be hid
[45:54] neither do men light a candle and put it
[45:56] under a bushel but on a Candlestick and
[45:58] it giveth light unto all that are in the
[46:01] house let your light so shine before men
[46:04] that they may see your good works and
[46:07] glorify
[46:08] your father which is in heaven amen I
[46:11] pray that God will add His blessings to
[46:13] the reading of the word as you have your
[46:15] seats tonight
[46:20] the last time that we spoke here we we
[46:23] dealt with works as it came even out of
[46:26] this reading where he said you know
[46:28] believe me for for the work's sake and
[46:30] we we talked about how God uses signs
[46:33] and wonders in order to vindicate his
[46:36] presence and we know that that we do not
[46:39] that we're not to go out looking for
[46:41] signs and wonders we're taught better
[46:44] than that we don't follow after signs
[46:47] and wonders that's actually completely
[46:49] backwards but signs and wonders are to
[46:52] follow after us signs and wonders are to
[46:55] follow after those that believe so as
[46:57] Believers tonight we shouldn't have any
[46:59] issue with expecting and believing for
[47:03] signs and wonders we shouldn't have any
[47:05] problem expecting for the power of God
[47:07] to operate in our midst because he to
[47:10] believe for the gifts to believe for the
[47:13] signs to believe for the Supernatural is
[47:15] not to seek after them the way that
[47:17] Azusa did okay they went to seed on
[47:21] those things and made those things their
[47:22] focus and and so doing they laid aside
[47:25] the word of God and their seeking of of
[47:27] the gifts so so we don't seek after them
[47:30] we believe for them we we expect them we
[47:34] believe that signs will follow we
[47:36] believe that that gifts are to operate
[47:38] in the church and why is that tonight
[47:40] why do we believe that we believe that
[47:42] because the word says that those things
[47:45] are going to be in our midst the word
[47:47] says that they're going to be there and
[47:49] as we read through the gospels and we
[47:51] can see that the supernatural operated
[47:54] in the ministry of Jesus Christ and as
[47:58] his bride it is also it is imperative
[48:00] that the Supernatural is part of our
[48:02] ministry because the ministries of the
[48:04] bride and the ministry of the groom
[48:06] cannot be different they they can't be
[48:08] two different Ministries they have to be
[48:10] one and the same brother Branham says
[48:13] God always vindicates his church by
[48:15] signs and wonders it's always been the
[48:18] sign of God a shout of it in in the camp
[48:21] of The King and I love this last part
[48:23] the king is in the camp today as a bunch
[48:27] of people
[48:28] that's wonderful when you recognize what
[48:30] he's saying right there the king is in
[48:32] the camp today as a bunch of people in
[48:35] other words the bride and the groom as
[48:38] one you are him he is you the the king
[48:43] is in the camp today as a bunch of
[48:45] people and so the ministry of the Bride
[48:47] will be just like the ministry of the
[48:49] groom and it will also be a Vindicated
[48:52] Ministry it has to be because God will
[48:55] always always has and always will
[48:57] vindicate his word time and time again
[49:00] he's done so even with the message of
[49:02] the hours we went over last time he
[49:05] Vindicated it and Vindicated it and even
[49:07] some would say over Vindicated it this
[49:09] message that it would call a bride out
[49:11] for his namesake and now in the closing
[49:14] of time through the ministry of the
[49:17] Bride the word of God will once again be
[49:20] Vindicated
[49:21] in other words it's going to be your
[49:24] life in the word operating and
[49:25] manifested through your life that will
[49:27] actually vindicate that this word is the
[49:31] truth we talked about last time how that
[49:33] fulfillment is the greatest Vindication
[49:35] there is it's going to be you the bride
[49:37] who's going to fulfill that there is a
[49:39] Rapture it's going to be you the bride
[49:42] that fulfills to him that overcometh you
[49:45] will vindicate this word in the last day
[49:48] there is going to be a people
[49:51] who will manifest Jesus Christ
[49:55] and that's what I want to speak to
[49:56] tonight about for a little while is
[49:58] manifesting Jesus
[50:00] manifesting Jesus to manifest is to
[50:04] display or show
[50:06] to demonstrate to be evidence of or
[50:10] prove
[50:11] now now I'm not saying it's wrong to
[50:13] tell people about Jesus you should tell
[50:16] people about Jesus there's no doubt
[50:17] about it but nowhere in manifest is the
[50:20] word tell
[50:21] nowhere in manifest is the word tell it
[50:24] is to display and show to demonstrate to
[50:28] be evidence of or proof in other words
[50:30] it says to make evident or certain by
[50:33] showing or displaying so tonight church
[50:37] this goes beyond a church that just
[50:39] happens to have correct Doctrine this
[50:41] goes beyond correct Doctrine this goes
[50:43] beyond good services and good people
[50:46] this has to be more than that this is a
[50:48] people who don't just talk about it they
[50:50] display it this is a people that don't
[50:53] just teach it they demonstrate it it has
[50:56] to be a life to live that you can't just
[50:58] tell people about the works they want to
[51:01] see what you're talking about the proof
[51:03] is in the pudding it's a people that
[51:05] will manifest Jesus how will people in
[51:08] the world ever know if this is the truth
[51:10] how will people in the world ever know
[51:12] if he is the same yesterday today and
[51:15] forever it's because the people who
[51:17] claim to believe that display it to the
[51:20] World the people who claim this message
[51:22] is the truth Manifest this into the
[51:25] world to the point that whether it's
[51:27] ever accepted or to the point that
[51:29] whether they ever receive it or not the
[51:32] manifestation of Jesus cannot be denied
[51:35] they may not accept it they may not
[51:37] receive it but they cannot deny that
[51:39] something is different there they cannot
[51:41] deny that that's a holy life they cannot
[51:44] deny that that's a Victorious Life
[51:46] and that's exactly what this broad is
[51:49] going to do you are going to be the
[51:52] instrument on the earth that Jesus will
[51:54] use to once again vindicate that he is
[51:56] the same yesterday today and forever
[51:58] who's he going to do it through he's
[52:00] going to do it through you he doesn't
[52:01] have hands here but your hands he
[52:03] doesn't have a voice here but your voice
[52:05] he is going to use you as the instrument
[52:08] to vindicate that he is the same
[52:10] yesterday today and forever you are the
[52:14] instrument that he's going to use once
[52:16] again to prove that this word will
[52:17] defeat Satan anywhere at any time you
[52:21] are that instrument you are that people
[52:23] you are that church you are the
[52:25] instrument that he's going to use to
[52:27] tear down the works of the devil It's a
[52:30] Wonderful position and a wonderful place
[52:32] to be in and once again it brings us
[52:34] back to the importance of the Dynamics
[52:36] always being there with the mechanics
[52:39] because without the same dynamics that
[52:42] Vindicated Jesus the church that stands
[52:44] this day and says that we're the bride
[52:46] we're the bride without that same
[52:48] Vindication their claim is false
[52:51] without that same Vindication they
[52:54] cannot claim to be the Bride of the last
[52:57] day
[52:58] you say how you say this even brother
[53:00] Brown would say it was the resurrection
[53:02] power that brought Jesus up out of the
[53:05] Grave that proved he was who he said he
[53:08] was
[53:09] well what about the three and a half
[53:11] years of ministry he said it was the
[53:12] resurrection power it was the
[53:15] resurrection that proved that he was
[53:16] unlike any other man it was the
[53:19] resurrecting power that proved all his
[53:21] claims were the truth and it's going to
[53:23] be that same power of Resurrection
[53:26] operating in abroad that will prove that
[53:29] this bride is who she says she is
[53:31] it's going to vindicate once and for all
[53:34] it's going to manifest once and for all
[53:35] that you are who you say you are
[53:39] brother brother Branham says Jesus said
[53:41] so he's the same yesterday today and
[53:43] forever how dare any man to wipe that
[53:46] out of there
[53:48] The Works that I do shall you do also
[53:50] John 14 12. these signs shall follow
[53:53] them that believe that is the assurance
[53:57] now this is a very strong statement he
[53:59] says that is the assurance
[54:01] when we see a group of people sitting
[54:03] together
[54:04] and those sides manifesting themselves
[54:07] that's the assurance that the abstract
[54:10] is there to vindicate that that is
[54:14] property of God Amen
[54:18] I don't know about you but I want that
[54:20] Assurance I want that Assurance in my
[54:22] own personal life I want that Assurance
[54:24] in my home I want that Assurance in our
[54:26] church I don't want to sit around and
[54:28] wonder
[54:29] I don't want to sit around and go well
[54:30] maybe well that was a good sermon well
[54:32] that was some good things where he said
[54:34] some nice things no I want to see Jesus
[54:36] Christ manifested in our midst I want to
[54:39] see the same signs I want to see the
[54:40] same wonders I want to see the same
[54:42] vindications he says that is the
[54:45] assurance that that is property of God
[54:49] I want that Assurance in my life I want
[54:52] to know just like Jesus said he said in
[54:55] that day
[54:56] you will know and brother Branham takes
[54:59] that and he says that day is this day
[55:03] he says at that day you will know that I
[55:06] am in my father and ye in me and I in
[55:09] you not you're going to have to wonder
[55:10] about it
[55:11] not you're going to have to guess well
[55:13] was he there today did he move today no
[55:16] you're gonna know because you're going
[55:17] to see it manifested through his people
[55:20] manifested in his church The Works that
[55:23] I do shall you do also it's a promise
[55:26] tonight it's not a pie in the sky it's
[55:29] not I hope he moves today I hope he'll
[55:31] heal I hope he'll save I hope he'll
[55:34] deliver he said he will do it and not
[55:37] only will he do it but he's going to do
[55:38] it through you you're gonna manifest
[55:41] Jesus
[55:45] I want to see the life and the ministry
[55:47] of Christ manifested in our midst
[55:51] I want to see victories I want to see
[55:54] healings I want to see salvations I want
[55:56] to see people filled with the Holy Ghost
[55:57] I want to see families restored I want
[56:00] to see overcoming lives those are the
[56:02] manifestations of Jesus Christ men and
[56:05] women overcoming the enemy in Satan's
[56:08] Eden
[56:09] I want his presence manifested in our
[56:11] midst oh I know it manifested in the
[56:14] past I know it manifested in the
[56:16] disciples I know it manifested in
[56:18] William branham's Ministry but I want to
[56:20] see it manifested in my life I want to
[56:23] see it manifested in your life I want to
[56:25] see it manifested in our homes
[56:28] we're a people that say we believe that
[56:30] the pillar of fire has returned to the
[56:32] church or we believe that the pillar of
[56:34] fire is Among Us well I'll tell you this
[56:37] we better believe it because without it
[56:38] we're in trouble
[56:41] but as a people who say they believe
[56:43] that then the pillar of fire should put
[56:45] us in action
[56:47] brother Branham says the pillar of fire
[56:48] should put you in action don't ever get
[56:51] to the place evening like Tabernacle
[56:53] will we get numb to the opportunity to
[56:54] come into its presence numb to the
[56:57] opportunity to come to the house of God
[56:58] on a Wednesday numb to the opportunity
[57:01] to come on a Sunday don't ever let it
[57:03] get to the point where his presence that
[57:05] Pillar of Fire moving I missed doesn't
[57:06] wow us doesn't amaze us doesn't bring us
[57:09] to where we have no choice but to
[57:11] worship with all our heart to give him
[57:13] everything we have don't get to the
[57:15] place where it becomes common but let it
[57:17] put you in action day after day after
[57:20] day let it be the energy down on the
[57:22] inside of you that pushes you to take
[57:24] another step to overcome another day to
[57:27] fight for your family to fight for your
[57:29] children to fight for your healing don't
[57:31] let it become common to you let it
[57:34] energize you tonight
[57:39] Pillar of Fire didn't come back to the
[57:41] church and have its picture taken have
[57:44] itself Vindicated so that we could be
[57:45] religious
[57:48] he didn't return to the church once
[57:50] again so that we could be church members
[57:53] he didn't open the seals and restore all
[57:55] the Bible truths just so we could be
[57:57] good people
[57:58] so we could be good men just to make
[58:00] fair and and honest citizens out of us
[58:04] this isn't just to produce good
[58:06] marriages and good homes although it
[58:08] will do those things
[58:10] but this message was sent to produce
[58:12] Jesus Christ on the Earth again in flesh
[58:16] again in a broad body it was sent to
[58:19] manifest Jesus
[58:21] that's got to be the desire of our
[58:23] hearts to produce Jesus once again a
[58:27] people that will continue the ministry
[58:29] of Jesus Christ right up until the day
[58:31] we go home
[58:32] a continuation of the ministry of Jesus
[58:36] Christ a match peace
[58:38] a match peace here on Earth
[58:41] well why is that so important because
[58:43] until there is a match peace here on the
[58:45] earth he's not coming back
[58:48] because when he comes back he's coming
[58:50] back to one that's just like him one
[58:52] that's just like him in every way bone
[58:54] of his bone flesh of his flesh power of
[58:56] his power
[58:57] there has to be a match piece here upon
[58:59] the Earth
[59:00] not just fair and honest and good
[59:03] there's many that can produce that
[59:06] there's a lot of fair and honest and
[59:07] good people
[59:09] there's many things there's many
[59:11] different churches that produce that but
[59:14] he's looking for a church that operates
[59:16] the way he operated a church that
[59:18] overcomes the way he overcame a church
[59:21] that isn't relying on self and our
[59:23] programs and how big we are and what we
[59:25] do and how we did this
[59:27] he's not looking to for for people who
[59:30] rely upon themselves but one who
[59:32] operates just like him because she is
[59:35] him
[59:36] he is in her and she is in him when he
[59:40] moves she moves when he speaks she
[59:42] speaks she has the word and she knows
[59:44] what he wants done with it
[59:47] she is the manifestation of Christ on
[59:49] the Earth again in flesh
[59:52] that's who you are
[59:54] that's who we are
[59:55] it's got to get Beyond just a gathering
[59:57] of people it's got to get Beyond just
[1:00:00] God sent a prophet it's got to get down
[1:00:02] on the inside of the inside of the
[1:00:04] inside that he's in me and I'm in him
[1:00:06] that I am he and he is me that I am his
[1:00:10] bride and together we are one and I'm
[1:00:12] doing the works that he wants done here
[1:00:13] on this Earth and he's coming back to
[1:00:15] take me because of that not because I
[1:00:17] came to church on Wednesday and I paid
[1:00:18] my tithes and I was a good person that's
[1:00:21] not what it's about but he needs a mat
[1:00:23] piece he's looking for somebody that
[1:00:25] sold out consecrated dedicated this is
[1:00:28] their life he is their life flow he is
[1:00:30] their source of energy
[1:00:31] [Music]
[1:00:34] foreign that's what we're called here
[1:00:37] for
[1:00:39] that's the whole reason that we are here
[1:00:45] a match piece to continue the ministry
[1:00:47] of Jesus Christ right through the very
[1:00:49] middle of Satan's Eden
[1:00:51] you know Jesus would say I am the light
[1:00:54] we've been hearing brother Timothy
[1:00:56] preach about the light it was so
[1:00:58] wonderful on Sunday
[1:01:00] he says I am the light and then he turns
[1:01:02] right around and says you are the light
[1:01:06] well I thought he was like his well I
[1:01:09] thought you were the light you are how
[1:01:10] can that be same life
[1:01:12] same Ministry same light living out on
[1:01:15] the inside it's not you with your own
[1:01:17] light and your ideas and how you think
[1:01:18] things should be it's you lining up with
[1:01:20] the word and that word coming on the
[1:01:22] inside of you and that light shining out
[1:01:24] to a Dying World and what's it doing
[1:01:26] everywhere you turn it's just like a
[1:01:28] lighthouse and it's shining a light on
[1:01:30] Jesus it manifests Jesus the life Jesus
[1:01:33] has she has the way he overcame she
[1:01:36] overcomes it's the same light the same
[1:01:39] life living out through a bride in this
[1:01:41] day same Ministry same light
[1:01:45] back to our opening scripture there in
[1:01:47] John 14.
[1:01:50] 14 10 says believeth Thou not that I am
[1:01:52] in the father
[1:01:53] and the father in me
[1:01:56] the words that I speak unto you I speak
[1:01:57] not of myself but the father that
[1:01:59] dwelleth in me he doeth the works
[1:02:02] believe me that I am in the father and
[1:02:04] the father and me are us believe me for
[1:02:06] the very work's sake
[1:02:08] know what he's telling them here
[1:02:12] is God above you
[1:02:14] has now become god with you
[1:02:18] God above you
[1:02:20] has now become
[1:02:21] god with you
[1:02:23] and that's how these works are being
[1:02:25] done
[1:02:26] it's the father and me doing the works
[1:02:29] and he's teaching them here not to be
[1:02:31] self-reliant
[1:02:33] not by might
[1:02:34] not by power but my spirit even Jesus
[1:02:38] Christ here taking no credit
[1:02:41] for what's being done
[1:02:43] I'm not doing this but it's my father
[1:02:46] doing this
[1:02:47] then the next verse
[1:02:50] 14 12 verily verily I say unto you he
[1:02:54] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:02:55] shall he do also in Greater Works than
[1:02:58] these shall he do because I go unto my
[1:02:59] father
[1:03:00] in other words you're not doing them yet
[1:03:02] because I'm still here and therefore my
[1:03:06] life can't enter into you at this point
[1:03:08] it's still God With Us
[1:03:11] it's still God With Us verse 13 and
[1:03:15] whatsoever you shall ask in my name that
[1:03:17] will I do that the father may be
[1:03:19] glorified in the son if you shall ask
[1:03:21] anything in my name I will do it if you
[1:03:23] love me keep my Commandments and I will
[1:03:25] pray the father that he shall give you
[1:03:26] another comforter that he may abide with
[1:03:28] you forever even the spirit of Truth who
[1:03:30] the world cannot receive because it
[1:03:32] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[1:03:35] know him
[1:03:37] for he dwelleth with you once again
[1:03:41] God With Us he's saying you know him
[1:03:44] because well here I am
[1:03:47] ye knowing because I'm with you right
[1:03:49] now you know who I am he says he
[1:03:52] dwelleth with you and shall be notice
[1:03:56] what this is this goes from present
[1:03:57] tense
[1:03:58] to future tense
[1:04:01] he dwells with you but shall be
[1:04:05] in you once I go away on the day of
[1:04:08] Pentecost I'm going to come back and
[1:04:10] it's no longer going to be a God above
[1:04:11] you it's no longer going to be God with
[1:04:13] you but now it's going to be God with
[1:04:16] you on the inside God and you got above
[1:04:18] us God With Us and God in us right here
[1:04:22] he's laying out the entire mystery you
[1:04:24] can look at this scripture and even see
[1:04:26] that the godhead explained
[1:04:28] he says and God is going to be in you
[1:04:33] future tense and I will not lead you
[1:04:36] comfortless I'm going to send the Holy
[1:04:38] Ghost but how's he say it
[1:04:40] ah will come to you
[1:04:43] well who's the Holy Ghost then the one
[1:04:45] that's sitting there talking to him
[1:04:47] I will come I will be the comforter
[1:04:51] yet a little while in the world seeth me
[1:04:53] no more but you see me because I live
[1:04:55] you shall live also and at that day ye
[1:04:58] shall know
[1:05:01] now remember earlier we were reading
[1:05:03] just a few verses up he's telling them
[1:05:04] you're going to know that it's I am the
[1:05:06] father and the father and me
[1:05:07] now we've done come down and in future
[1:05:09] tense he's told about the day of
[1:05:11] Pentecost now the whole thing's
[1:05:13] different that I am in the father that
[1:05:15] hasn't changed but now there's a
[1:05:16] glorious change there's something
[1:05:18] marvelous here it's just not he's in the
[1:05:21] father and the father's in him but ye in
[1:05:24] me and I in you in other words the same
[1:05:28] way that it's not me doing the works
[1:05:30] you're going to do works and it's not
[1:05:31] going to be you doing the works the same

[1:06:51] and Christ in his body the bride oh my
[1:06:55] God made manifest in Christ Christ made
[1:06:58] manifest in the bride and as God took
[1:07:00] from the body of Adam the woman and she
[1:07:03] fell then God has took from the body of
[1:07:06] Christ his flesh his body which is his
[1:07:09] word and is bringing a broad out that
[1:07:11] won't fall by denomination or Creed no
[1:07:13] sir but she is coming back with the pure
[1:07:16] unadulterated word of God being
[1:07:19] manifested
[1:07:21] if you stop short of the being
[1:07:23] manifested you missed it you're not just
[1:07:25] coming back with the word you're not
[1:07:27] just coming back with a head knowledge
[1:07:29] you're not just coming back with some
[1:07:30] books and some tapes you're not just
[1:07:32] coming back but you're coming back with
[1:07:33] the word being manifested the word in
[1:07:36] action the word overcoming the word
[1:07:39] defeating the devil the word Healing The
[1:07:41] Sick the word feeling with the Holy
[1:07:43] Ghost the word being manifested in a
[1:07:45] broad body
[1:07:49] laughs
[1:07:50] so I ask you how can we not preach the
[1:07:52] supernatural
[1:07:55] foreign
[1:07:57] how can we not believe for the
[1:07:59] supernatural how can we not live in the
[1:08:02] Supernatural let me ask you this how can
[1:08:04] you not be Supernatural
[1:08:11] this bride cannot be some stiff-neck
[1:08:14] starchy ritualistic Church
[1:08:17] it can't be
[1:08:18] it can't be cold it can't be formal it
[1:08:20] can't be dead
[1:08:22] how can she be
[1:08:24] if she is to be him and his works
[1:08:27] manifested
[1:08:30] well I am Jesus you're telling me that
[1:08:32] Jesus is lukewarm
[1:08:36] you telling me he's cold and starchy
[1:08:38] you tell me there ain't no fire in his
[1:08:40] belly you tell me there ain't no energy
[1:08:42] to get more to go deeper you telling me
[1:08:45] he didn't have a passion for this word
[1:08:47] this bride will by no means be a
[1:08:49] lukewarm if you're cold and you're
[1:08:51] formal then you start you there's no
[1:08:53] movement of this Spirit there's no
[1:08:54] manifestation of God you have no right
[1:08:57] to claim the title of Bride of Jesus
[1:08:59] Christ
[1:09:01] foreign
[1:09:06] because this bride will be full of the
[1:09:08] life of Jesus the this bride will have
[1:09:10] Victory this is this bride will have
[1:09:12] life this this bride will have worship
[1:09:14] this bride will have joy this bride will
[1:09:16] have overcoming power there will be
[1:09:18] Deliverance in this bride
[1:09:23] brother Brown says now Christ
[1:09:25] The Works that I do shall you do also
[1:09:27] see the same God see the works that I do
[1:09:29] shall you do also more than this for I
[1:09:31] go unto my father the church will be a
[1:09:34] little longer in the light see
[1:09:35] vindicating his promised word the church
[1:09:39] will be vindicating his promised word as
[1:09:43] God did his promises in Christ's body so
[1:09:46] is Christ doing the same Works in
[1:09:48] Christ's body the church see now making
[1:09:52] his mystery known to his broad tree in
[1:09:54] the last day bringing forth the fruits
[1:09:56] that was in the tree at the beginning
[1:10:01] he says there's many different gifts
[1:10:02] that God has to his church but they're
[1:10:04] all for the perfecting of the church to
[1:10:06] bring together in unity the great body
[1:10:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ and the powers
[1:10:11] that was in Christ has been given to his
[1:10:14] church all that God was he poured into
[1:10:17] Christ and Christ was God manifested on
[1:10:21] the earth and all that Christ was he
[1:10:23] poured into his church and all the
[1:10:27] powers that God had rested in Christ and
[1:10:30] the fullness of Christ rest in his
[1:10:33] church so what a people this should be
[1:10:38] what a people this should be
[1:10:43] a people that sit there stone-faced
[1:10:45] we have all the power
[1:10:48] but we don't believe in praying for
[1:10:49] anybody
[1:10:52] we have all the power but we don't
[1:10:54] believe in prayer lines we don't believe
[1:10:55] in the opportunity to cast Devils off
[1:10:57] people who are struggling but we have
[1:10:59] all the power
[1:11:01] what are you doing with it
[1:11:05] what are you doing
[1:11:09] you find yourself in the place of the
[1:11:11] one who dug a hole and buried everything
[1:11:14] and said this is this is this is ours
[1:11:16] this is ours
[1:11:18] and he's going to say depart from me
[1:11:21] because I gave you all this and you did
[1:11:23] nothing with it
[1:11:24] I gave you all this and I expected you
[1:11:26] to manifest me I expected you to show a
[1:11:28] Dying World I expect you you to show
[1:11:30] them that I was the same yesterday today
[1:11:32] and forever I expected you to manifest
[1:11:35] Jesus
[1:11:36] and what did you do with it
[1:11:39] he says what a people we should be
[1:11:42] and what do we have to do brother Aaron
[1:11:44] what do I have to do to make all this
[1:11:46] happen just let it flow

[1:11:51] just quit hindering the manifestation of
[1:11:54] Jesus Christ that's all you have to do
[1:11:56] is let the light shine take the bushel

[1:12:09] Darkness out there let it light up the
[1:12:11] world there's people that need that
[1:12:13] light
[1:12:14] you don't have to try and manufacture it
[1:12:16] all we have to do is not fight against
[1:12:18] it let that life do what that life has
[1:12:21] always done let that Ministry do what it
[1:12:24] has always done it's always healed the
[1:12:26] sick it's always casted out Devils it's

[1:12:50] light
[1:12:51] there's a world that needs to see it
[1:12:55] look I'll tell you what
[1:12:56] we don't see the children of the devil
[1:12:58] afraid to manifest his works
[1:13:03] we don't see the enemy fighting against
[1:13:04] themselves manifesting you know fighting
[1:13:07] whether or not they should manifest the
[1:13:09] spirit that they're of
[1:13:10] they're not ashamed of it they're not
[1:13:13] afraid to let that spirit that controls
[1:13:14] them to be manifested to a world
[1:13:17] we don't have to see them having a
[1:13:18] problem spreading the works of darkness
[1:13:21] they don't have a problem allowing the
[1:13:22] spirit that they are of you know out
[1:13:24] through their life I'll tell you another
[1:13:26] thing they sure don't have they don't
[1:13:27] have a problem worshiping their God with
[1:13:29] all their heart

[1:13:32] devil a hundred percent
[1:13:35] they manifest his life they vindicate
[1:13:38] that from the beginning he was a liar

[1:13:44] they Vindicated in their lives they've
[1:13:46] Vindicated in their laws they've
[1:13:47] Vindicated in their government I say

[1:14:54] strong enough to cause people to
[1:14:55] manifest that what about the power of
[1:14:57] the light
[1:14:59] is it not strong enough to cause people
[1:15:01] to manifest Jesus
[1:15:06] Hallelujah
[1:15:09] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:15:12] it's time we quit talking about it and

[1:15:22] the one we serve is more powerful the
[1:15:24] one we serve is worthy of Our Praise

[1:15:29] worthy of a consecrated life
[1:15:32] quit talking about it and manifest it
[1:15:35] we've reached the end time Satan has a
[1:15:38] broad tree and it's being made manifest

[1:15:44] and through that bride he is being made
[1:15:46] manifest in the flesh
[1:15:49] I want to tell you
[1:15:51] if he was Victorious In the Flesh of the
[1:15:54] groom
[1:15:55] he's gonna be victorious in the flesh of
[1:15:58] the Bride you got nothing to fear you've
[1:16:01] got nothing to worry about he faced it
[1:16:03] head on and he showed Time After Time
[1:16:05] After Time that you could defeat Satan
[1:16:08] with the word he didn't even use some
[1:16:10] amazing Supernatural Powers he literally
[1:16:13] just looked him in the face and said it
[1:16:15] is written it is written it is written I
[1:16:18] tell you tonight it is written I will
[1:16:20] have a church without spot or wrinkle it

[1:16:24] it is written that by his stripes you
[1:16:26] are healed it is written that the Holy
[1:16:28] Ghost is to you and into your children
[1:16:30] and to the many others are far off it is
[1:16:33] written that you can have joy it is
[1:16:35] written that you can have peace take the

[1:16:39] manifest his victory and overcome the
[1:16:42] enemy tonight oh come on possess the
[1:16:44] gates of your entity tonight surrender
[1:16:47] yourself like Samson did when he
[1:16:49] surrendered his strength and he went
[1:16:50] there and he took the gates and he took
[1:16:52] him up to a hill on Hebron oh come on
[1:16:55] there was a a greater feat of strength
[1:16:57] one time when Jesus Took the cross of
[1:16:59] Calvary and he marched it up that hill
[1:17:00] he could have quit he could have stopped
[1:17:02] but he kept going he kept going in that
[1:17:05] same life is on the inside of you
[1:17:07] tonight and it says keep going take
[1:17:09] those Gates of depression take those
[1:17:11] Gates of anxiety take those Gates of
[1:17:13] fear take those Gates that are keeping
[1:17:16] you in prison rip them down and take
[1:17:18] them up calvary's hill tonight and leave
[1:17:20] them there manifest Jesus tonight
[1:17:24] Hallelujah
[1:17:26] okay
[1:17:28] Jesus manifested once again
[1:17:31] in the flesh
[1:17:35] we got to quit looking
[1:17:36] to our own natural abilities
[1:17:41] looking to our failures
[1:17:46] yes we are failures
[1:17:49] quit looking to your shortcomings to our
[1:17:51] humanity and wondering how can this be
[1:17:54] and turn that into be it unto me
[1:18:00] Mary didn't know how either
[1:18:02] she just said be it unto me
[1:18:05] I don't know how
[1:18:07] but I know it's not going to be me
[1:18:09] because in that day I will know
[1:18:12] that he is in me and I in him in the
[1:18:15] same way it was the father doing the
[1:18:17] works through him it is him doing the
[1:18:19] works through me I don't have to worry
[1:18:22] about it
[1:18:23] I just got to quit hindering
[1:18:27] we got to accept what we've been called
[1:18:29] to be
[1:18:30] it's believing that all things are
[1:18:32] possible
[1:18:33] it's recognizing that the
[1:18:35] impossibilities have been removed
[1:18:37] because it's him manifesting the works
[1:18:39] through us and when he's involved there
[1:18:41] are no impossibilities
[1:18:44] listen we as humans can't do the works I
[1:18:46] totally recognize that
[1:18:48] it's Christ in his bride doing the works
[1:18:51] and manifesting his ministry through her
[1:18:54] whenever we we think that we have to do
[1:18:55] it then that puts a pressure on us
[1:18:58] and we think we have to make this happen
[1:18:59] we have to make that happen and what it
[1:19:01] causes is carnal impersonations
[1:19:04] like you have to speak in tongues
[1:19:07] you have to do this you have to and it
[1:19:09] causes carnal impersonations there's
[1:19:11] nothing I have to do but seek more of
[1:19:13] Jesus Christ
[1:19:15] there's nothing I have to do but seek
[1:19:18] more of him and seek his will and be
[1:19:19] submissive and say Lord
[1:19:21] take control that's all you have to do
[1:19:24] and he does the work through you he
[1:19:27] manifests himself through you
[1:19:29] there's no pressure it's him
[1:19:32] it's him doing it it's his life living
[1:19:36] look I didn't wake up this morning and
[1:19:38] have to try to be in Oglesby
[1:19:43] I lived this whole day as an Oglesby
[1:19:46] everything I did was as an oglesman
[1:19:49] because that's who I Am Naturally
[1:19:54] and the life on the inside of me I
[1:19:55] didn't have to make myself be a
[1:19:57] Christian
[1:19:58] I didn't have to make myself do those
[1:20:00] things you get Jesus on the inside and
[1:20:02] you just wake up and that life begins to
[1:20:04] live out of you because that's who you
[1:20:08] are
[1:20:10] that's who your DNA is it affects
[1:20:14] everything you do why you think when you
[1:20:15] go to the doctor they want to know your
[1:20:16] daddy's family history or medical
[1:20:18] history
[1:20:18] tell us about the medical history of
[1:20:20] your father I mean I won't tell them
[1:20:22] that
[1:20:23] because then they want to start putting
[1:20:24] stuff on you
[1:20:26] they want to start telling you well yeah
[1:20:28] well you know what it's okay if the
[1:20:30] devil asks me about my father's history
[1:20:32] I'll tell him all about that
[1:20:34] I don't want to tell you not necessarily
[1:20:36] about my natural history there's a lot
[1:20:37] of failures in my natural history but
[1:20:39] let me point you to my spiritual history
[1:20:41] let me point you to my royal family he's
[1:20:44] an overcomer in that life manifests
[1:20:46] through me he's a Healer and that life
[1:20:47] manifests through me he's a savior he's
[1:20:50] a deliverer
[1:20:51] oh my he's the mighty conqueror that
[1:20:54] life manifests through me as I conquer
[1:20:57] in this day we're here to manifest
[1:21:00] Jesus he says father now into your hands
[1:21:03] we commit this service there's not a man
[1:21:05] on the face of the Earth Lord not none
[1:21:08] of us could do this
[1:21:10] it will be you
[1:21:12] excuse me
[1:21:14] so as we have spoken the prophets of old
[1:21:16] were so anointed under that atonement
[1:21:18] that they saw visions and Jesus said
[1:21:20] himself it's not me that doeth the works
[1:21:22] it's my father that dwelleth in me I do
[1:21:25] that which always pleases him verily I
[1:21:28] say unto you I can do nothing in myself
[1:21:31] but what I see the father doing that
[1:21:33] doeth the son likewise let it be tonight
[1:21:37] Lord that they will see the works of God
[1:21:40] manifested through his church
[1:21:43] a Living Church
[1:21:45] a breathing Church a church that finds
[1:21:48] its energy in him that Finds Its source
[1:21:52] and its power in him you see it's always
[1:21:55] been about his strength everything down
[1:21:57] through the Bible has been about history
[1:21:58] that's never been about the strength of
[1:21:59] a man even the heroes we read about it
[1:22:02] was never about their strength it was it
[1:22:04] was about them yielding themselves to
[1:22:06] God it wasn't Moses leading it was the
[1:22:09] pillar of Fire
[1:22:11] it wasn't Moses providing all the
[1:22:13] millions and millions of stuff you
[1:22:15] talked about Sunday that was amazing
[1:22:17] was it Moses doing that it was God doing
[1:22:20] that it was those Works being manifested
[1:22:23] through Moses notice what David says to
[1:22:26] to Goliath in first Samuel 17 45 then
[1:22:29] said David to the Philistine thou cometh
[1:22:31] to me with a sword and with the spear
[1:22:33] and with the shield
[1:22:34] in other words you come to me in your
[1:22:36] strength with your skills and your
[1:22:39] protection
[1:22:41] now notice there was a trap laid for
[1:22:43] David
[1:22:44] actually Saul did it
[1:22:46] it was a trap to go face Goliath with
[1:22:50] the same weapons that Goliath had
[1:22:53] it was a trap to go face him in human
[1:22:56] abilities with human armor with human
[1:22:59] ideas listen you better not ever go out
[1:23:01] and face the enemy with your ideas or
[1:23:03] even the ideas of a church
[1:23:06] you better be going out with the
[1:23:07] manifested power of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:09] Christ to face your enemy that is the
[1:23:11] only way you can go and face your enemy
[1:23:13] but David turn the Trap down
[1:23:15] and we have to be like David recognize
[1:23:17] it wasn't my strength that killed the
[1:23:19] bear it wasn't my strength that that
[1:23:21] killed the line it was the the Lord that
[1:23:25] came into me and took possession of this
[1:23:27] body it was him that it was a
[1:23:28] manifestation of the Lord God of Israel
[1:23:31] that's why David says to him you come to
[1:23:34] me in human strength you come to me with
[1:23:36] human skill and with your human
[1:23:38] protection but I come to thee in the
[1:23:40] name of the Lord of hosts the god of the
[1:23:43] army of Israel whom thou Hast defied
[1:23:47] this is how we have to uh approach every
[1:23:49] single battle we Face we have to go into
[1:23:52] it trust in his might we have to go into
[1:23:54] it trust in his power and his ability
[1:23:56] because in ourselves we can't do it I
[1:24:00] can't manifest Jesus in myself
[1:24:04] this flesh will fail every single time
[1:24:07] but if I'll lean on him if I'll lean
[1:24:10] into him a little more if I'll trust him
[1:24:12] a little more for the situation I'm in
[1:24:14] for the trial that I'm in
[1:24:16] look we heard it Sunday whatever hits
[1:24:18] you're on tonight he's been there before
[1:24:21] wherever you're standing at tonight
[1:24:22] whatever you're going through he's been
[1:24:24] victorious in that situation before
[1:24:28] he has kept people who thought they were
[1:24:30] going to quit he has restored joy to
[1:24:33] those who are battling depression he has
[1:24:35] filled those with the Holy Ghost who
[1:24:37] never thought they had hope he's given
[1:24:39] New Life to those who are going to
[1:24:40] commit suicide he has done those things
[1:24:43] before and he'll do it for you brother
[1:24:45] Timothy says that that fishing God said
[1:24:47] he didn't just want to take him out
[1:24:48] there to see pretty things he wanted to
[1:24:50] take them out there to catch fish he had
[1:24:53] a goal in mind he didn't just bring you
[1:24:55] out to heal you he didn't just bring you
[1:24:57] out to give you a new doctrine he didn't
[1:24:59] just bring you out this God is going to
[1:25:01] take you all the way he brought you out
[1:25:04] to take you in he brought you out in
[1:25:07] order to Rapture and he will not fail
[1:25:11] Wherever You Are Tonight lean into him
[1:25:16] we see it all through the Old Testament
[1:25:18] as as different ones yielded themselves
[1:25:20] to God and allowed him
[1:25:22] to be made manifest through their life
[1:25:25] it was God's wisdom in Solomon
[1:25:28] it was God's strength in Samson
[1:25:31] and then at the end of the Old Testament
[1:25:33] we see Jesus comes and he completely
[1:25:35] authenticates the Old Testament and now
[1:25:39] there is a bride who will be so
[1:25:40] consecrated
[1:25:42] so sold out that she will allow him
[1:25:45] through her to authenticate the new
[1:25:50] to manifest Jesus Christ once again
[1:25:54] I say let there be a fresh outpouring of
[1:25:57] the Holy Ghost tonight let there be a
[1:25:59] fresh out porn and and bring that
[1:26:01] life-giving revelation God was
[1:26:03] manifested in Christ and now Christ is
[1:26:06] manifested in his bride you got to bring
[1:26:08] it down Christ is manifested in me to
[1:26:12] where you become the Living Word
[1:26:14] manifested what can the devil do with
[1:26:17] that oh he can do a lot with your flesh
[1:26:19] he can attack you he can attack your
[1:26:21] failures and he can attack your
[1:26:23] shortcomings but what can he do with the
[1:26:25] Living Word manifested we saw what he
[1:26:29] can do with it there when Jesus was on
[1:26:31] the face of the Earth nothing all he can
[1:26:34] do is be defeated and thought in Time
[1:26:36] After Time After Time After Time and I
[1:26:39] say once again the Living Word
[1:26:41] manifested will defeat Satan time after
[1:26:44] a Time After Time After Time if we just
[1:26:47] allow it to manifest itself in our lives
[1:26:53] he says Church of God is a living
[1:26:55] article of God on Earth manifesting
[1:26:58] Jesus Christ I know it's not popular you
[1:27:01] can't expect to be but we expect to be
[1:27:03] right
[1:27:05] oh I like that
[1:27:07] he says the word has become the church
[1:27:09] and the church is the word God all that
[1:27:12] God was he poured into Christ all that
[1:27:14] Christ was he poured into the church the
[1:27:16] Holy Ghost now the enemy's got something
[1:27:18] see then he isn't fighting something
[1:27:20] back here many people just take the
[1:27:23] letter
[1:27:24] the letter killeth the spirit giveth
[1:27:27] life see see and they take these Creeds
[1:27:30] and so forth killeth but when you are
[1:27:33] taking the spirit that's God himself how
[1:27:37] do you know it's God because he's taken
[1:27:40] the word and manifesting it see then
[1:27:43] it's God himself
[1:27:46] he said all that God was he poured into
[1:27:48] Christ all that Christ was he poured
[1:27:51] into the church
[1:27:52] so I ask you what kind of power does the
[1:27:55] believing church have
[1:27:57] well what kind of power did Jesus have
[1:28:00] according to Matthew 28 18 says he had
[1:28:03] all power in heavens and earth
[1:28:07] all power the power that created
[1:28:09] eyeballs he had it
[1:28:12] the power that created worlds he had it
[1:28:15] oh no wonder he said you could create a
[1:28:17] world and go live on it
[1:28:20] because the power that created eyeballs
[1:28:22] you have it the power that created
[1:28:25] worlds you have it
[1:28:27] oh come on let's bring it down a little
[1:28:29] bit the power to overcome Temptation you
[1:28:31] have it the power to overcome sin you
[1:28:34] have it the power to say get thee behind
[1:28:36] me Satan you have it the power to create
[1:28:38] an atmosphere where lives can be changed
[1:28:41] you have it then let's don't talk about
[1:28:44] it let's manifest it let's do something
[1:28:47] with it let's put it in action let's put
[1:28:49] the devil on the run tonight and let the
[1:28:51] life of Jesus Christ manifest through
[1:28:54] evening lights Tabernacle
[1:28:56] do something with it
[1:28:58] First John 3 8 he that committed sin is
[1:29:00] of the devil for the devil sinneth from
[1:29:02] the beginning for this purpose the Son
[1:29:05] of God was manifested that he might
[1:29:07] destroy the works of the devil then I
[1:29:10] say for this purpose is the bride of
[1:29:12] Christ manifested that they might
[1:29:15] destroy the works of the devil we got a
[1:29:18] job to do we got work to do oh how do we
[1:29:21] do it just let him manifest himself
[1:29:25] manifest Jesus tonight
[1:29:31] a bride
[1:29:33] manifesting Jesus
[1:29:38] now
[1:29:40] just for the sake of
[1:29:42] balance
[1:29:46] I want to point out that this isn't just
[1:29:49] all about what some might call the
[1:29:51] miraculous
[1:29:52] the signs and wonders the gifts
[1:29:54] manifestations of the Spirit
[1:29:57] you know I preach and believe and
[1:29:59] advocate for those things because
[1:30:00] without that element you cannot be bone
[1:30:02] of his bone and flesh of his flesh
[1:30:04] you've got to have it
[1:30:06] there's no question about that
[1:30:10] whenever he manifests himself in a body
[1:30:13] the supernatural will accompany that
[1:30:16] body
[1:30:18] however I do want to make it clear that
[1:30:19] we understand that gifts and callings
[1:30:21] are without repentance
[1:30:23] and that we've been taught well enough
[1:30:25] to know that rain can fall on the just
[1:30:27] and on the unjust
[1:30:29] gifts can operate and the spirit
[1:30:31] manifests on those who aren't even his
[1:30:34] or those who are living backslidden
[1:30:37] living in a sinful condition
[1:30:40] we saw that when brother Brown first
[1:30:42] encountered the Pentecostal people and
[1:30:44] he dealt with the two men that were
[1:30:45] dealing with the gift of speaking in
[1:30:46] tongues and interpretation and he saw
[1:30:49] that one was a true Christian and one
[1:30:51] was a total hypocrite
[1:30:52] we see that in the life of Balaam
[1:30:55] where brother Brown says
[1:30:57] just let us take a look at Balaam he was
[1:31:00] religious he worshiped God he understood
[1:31:02] the prophet proper method of sacrifice
[1:31:04] and approaching unto God but he was not
[1:31:07] a true seed Prophet for he took the
[1:31:09] wages of unrighteousness and worst of
[1:31:11] all he led the people of God into sins a
[1:31:13] fornication and idolatry he says yet who
[1:31:16] would dare deny
[1:31:18] that the spirit of God manifested
[1:31:21] through him
[1:31:25] in one of the most beautiful portions of
[1:31:28] absolutely accurate prophecy the world
[1:31:31] has ever
[1:31:32] seen
[1:31:35] wow
[1:31:36] we're there and you just turned this
[1:31:38] whole thing upside down
[1:31:40] no no
[1:31:41] that's not the case
[1:31:43] all of this that I just said is true but
[1:31:46] that doesn't mean we still don't want it
[1:31:50] don't let the bogus scare you away from
[1:31:52] the genuine
[1:31:54] don't let the fact that it's raining in
[1:31:56] that field make you not want it to rain
[1:31:58] in this field
[1:32:00] don't let the scarecrows turn you away
[1:32:03] the Life of Christ must still be
[1:32:06] manifested in US
[1:32:09] and in that life it will produce signs
[1:32:12] and it will produce wonders and it will
[1:32:14] produce the miraculous but it will also
[1:32:17] produce a life well lived
[1:32:21] it will also produce love
[1:32:25] it will also produce kindness it will
[1:32:28] also produce gentleness it will produce
[1:32:30] sweetness it will produce a life free
[1:32:33] from sin so we want all those things
[1:32:35] we've been preaching about but it better
[1:32:37] go hand in hand with this part of it as
[1:32:40] well a life free from sin a life full of
[1:32:43] love not bitterness and cranky and
[1:32:45] backbiting and two-toned
[1:32:47] it's got to produce a Christian life so
[1:32:50] what are you saying I'm saying don't for
[1:32:51] one moment hang your hat on on a
[1:32:54] manifestation of the spirit if your life
[1:32:56] isn't lining up with the fullness of the
[1:32:58] word
[1:33:00] there has to be both of those things
[1:33:02] going hand in hand there has to be a
[1:33:04] balance there yes it's about the word
[1:33:06] yes you must line up with the word Jesus
[1:33:09] is the word but then don't turn around
[1:33:11] and Rob the power out of the word
[1:33:15] yes it should be word word word word but
[1:33:18] in that word there should be Dynamics
[1:33:19] Dynamics Dynamics Dynamics
[1:33:22] you cannot separate the two
[1:33:25] and you also don't want to live a life
[1:33:27] that's based nothing on Dynamics when
[1:33:28] there's no anchor holding you when
[1:33:30] there's nothing that's taken a hold in
[1:33:32] your soul
[1:33:34] brother Brown says oh if we Christians
[1:33:37] if we ministers if we men women
[1:33:39] Pentecostals and the rest of us if we
[1:33:41] can't take what God said his church
[1:33:43] should be
[1:33:44] if we can't measure up to the stature
[1:33:46] that he said then we can be condemned of
[1:33:49] sin
[1:33:50] now he's at this point speaking of the
[1:33:52] supernatural
[1:33:53] of unbelief we try to say that the days
[1:33:56] a miracle has passed and all these other
[1:33:58] things and so on and so on then we can
[1:34:01] be accused of unbelief for there's only
[1:34:04] one sin and that's unbelief he that
[1:34:06] believeth not as condemned already see
[1:34:08] you don't even get to first base if you
[1:34:11] don't believe
[1:34:13] I'm gonna skip down a little bit he goes
[1:34:14] on says that's what God wants that's
[1:34:16] what God will have a bunch of people
[1:34:18] that can say what has Jesus Christ
[1:34:21] promised what has been promised in the
[1:34:23] last days that hasn't been manifested
[1:34:26] through US amen
[1:34:28] if there's anything we're lacking let's
[1:34:30] do it if there's anything lacking with
[1:34:32] us let's get back to that let's remember
[1:34:34] what he required not what we think we
[1:34:37] ought to have but what he said we got to
[1:34:40] have see we got to have it that way the
[1:34:43] way that he said it
[1:34:45] now if you skip on now he's talking
[1:34:47] about the supernatural talking about the
[1:34:48] supernatural that's what he's dealing
[1:34:49] with here but then at the bottom of this
[1:34:50] quote he said now let's think seriously
[1:34:53] now
[1:34:54] we Pentecostal people I wonder if we
[1:34:56] receive the Holy Ghost just for
[1:34:58] entertainment
[1:35:01] do we want the Holy Ghost to move just
[1:35:03] so we can say we had a good service
[1:35:07] he says
[1:35:09] but there's more than that goes with it
[1:35:12] there's a life that's got to be lived
[1:35:18] just because the signs and wonders are
[1:35:20] manifested out of your life does not
[1:35:21] mean you are manifesting the life of
[1:35:23] Jesus
[1:35:24] Janice and jamboree's manifested signs
[1:35:27] and wonders
[1:35:29] there has to be a life that goes with it
[1:35:32] when Jesus is manifested there will be
[1:35:34] shouts there will be dances there will
[1:35:36] be Visions there will be tongues there
[1:35:38] will be prophecies there will be
[1:35:39] Supernatural they must be
[1:35:42] I don't want to be accused of unbelief
[1:35:44] as he says I don't want to be accused of
[1:35:47] sin but there will also be a life that
[1:35:50] follows that Supernatural an overcoming
[1:35:52] life a Victorious Life a life free from
[1:35:54] sin free from the world free from
[1:35:56] worldly pleasures it'll manifest itself
[1:35:59] in Bible holiness
[1:36:01] it'll produce women that line up with
[1:36:03] the word
[1:36:04] I'm not stopping right there it'll
[1:36:06] produce men that line up with the word
[1:36:08] it will produce homes that are ordered
[1:36:11] properly under the proper headship
[1:36:12] according to the word
[1:36:15] it will produce Christians and
[1:36:17] Overcomers in the layout of cnh well
[1:36:21] brother Aaron I liked it better when you
[1:36:23] was talking about all the signs and
[1:36:24] wonders
[1:36:25] let me tell you what an overcomer in
[1:36:27] laodicea is a sign and a wonder you talk
[1:36:30] about a powerful God you talk about a
[1:36:32] supernatural God that in this day
[1:36:33] there's people still standing there's
[1:36:35] people this day that still have Holiness
[1:36:37] there's people in this day still
[1:36:38] standing with morals still standing for
[1:36:40] this Christianity surrounded by evil
[1:36:43] there's still a Bible believing people
[1:36:45] standing that is a sign that is a wonder
[1:36:47] that is the miraculous the miracle of a
[1:36:50] holy ghost filled life there's nothing
[1:36:52] more miraculous than that in this day
[1:36:55] that is miraculous because in this day
[1:36:58] there's one standing that's totally
[1:37:00] different from Eve
[1:37:01] there's one that's not going to fall the
[1:37:03] way e failed there's one that's going to
[1:37:05] stand and overcome and that in and of
[1:37:08] itself is miraculous
[1:37:12] you think about it Eve could not stand
[1:37:14] in God's Own Eden
[1:37:17] Satan made efall in God's Own Eden and
[1:37:20] that day Satan has relished that day for
[1:37:23] thousands of years and yet now the
[1:37:25] tables have turned and God's got an eve
[1:37:28] that will not fall and Satan's eaten and
[1:37:31] I say God has relished this day for
[1:37:34] eternity he's been looking forward to
[1:37:36] this day when a people would manifest
[1:37:38] his life right in the garden of Satan's
[1:37:42] Eden
[1:37:43] and would not fall you talk about the
[1:37:46] miraculous
[1:37:49] a bride manifesting Jesus
[1:37:55] called in this day to be the light
[1:37:57] oh brother Aaron I can't be that light I
[1:37:59] I can yes you can
[1:38:01] and yes you are and yes you will be
[1:38:05] just accept what you've been called to
[1:38:07] be
[1:38:08] quit bringing up what you can and can't
[1:38:10] do he does the works through you it's
[1:38:13] not me that doeth the work
[1:38:15] it was his calling and it was his
[1:38:17] choosing and it will be him doing the
[1:38:19] work
[1:38:20] brother Branham says then if you are a
[1:38:22] son of God or a daughter of God you are
[1:38:25] in God all the time but he knew what bed
[1:38:28] and time you would be planted so now you
[1:38:33] made a creature a Son of God manifested
[1:38:37] son or daughter of God to meet the
[1:38:39] challenge of this hour to vindicate the
[1:38:42] true and living God of this hour the
[1:38:45] message that's coming forth in this time
[1:38:47] brother Branham said he knew you all
[1:38:50] alone but he planted you in a certain
[1:38:52] time for a certain purpose oh I can't
[1:38:55] overcome are you telling me that God
[1:38:56] made a mistake
[1:38:58] are you telling me that he chose the
[1:39:00] wrong ones I say not I say he knew there
[1:39:03] was a sea gene on the inside of you he
[1:39:05] knew there was something on the inside
[1:39:06] of you that would stand he knew there
[1:39:08] was something on the inside of you that
[1:39:09] wouldn't back up that wouldn't fall that
[1:39:12] wouldn't denominate this word but would
[1:39:13] stand true and he said there's one
[1:39:15] there's one there's one they'll be part
[1:39:18] of my end time bride they'll stand in
[1:39:20] Satan's Eden they won't be overcome but
[1:39:23] they will be the Overcomers of the age
[1:39:25] as Jesus Christ is once again manifested
[1:39:29] in flesh
[1:39:31] Hallelujah
[1:39:39] I'm going to start bringing this down he
[1:39:41] says
[1:39:42] then he had been in the spirit made
[1:39:44] manifest In the Flesh to take away sins
[1:39:47] God return back to God's spirit and now
[1:39:50] when they take this picture today with
[1:39:52] us and the people of the Lord is the
[1:39:55] same Pillar of Fire now the only way it
[1:39:57] can be proven that it's the same Pillar
[1:40:00] of Fire is it'll do the same works
[1:40:02] if it is the same Pillar of Fire the
[1:40:04] spirit of God Jesus said a little while
[1:40:07] in the world seeth me no more yet ye
[1:40:08] shall see me for I will be with you even
[1:40:10] in you to the end of the world Hebrews
[1:40:12] 13 8 said Jesus Christ the same
[1:40:14] yesterday today and forever then if this
[1:40:16] Spirit doesn't produce the Life of
[1:40:18] Christ then it isn't the spirit of God
[1:40:22] now if I stood here with nail scars in
[1:40:24] my hand and Prince all over my head here
[1:40:27] in the form of the crown of thorns and
[1:40:28] told you that the spirit of God was in
[1:40:29] me that wouldn't make it so my hands
[1:40:32] could actually be scarred that wouldn't
[1:40:34] be in evidence but when you can say that
[1:40:37] the spirit of God is in us then the
[1:40:38] works of God will be manifested through
[1:40:41] your life in other words if a tree he's
[1:40:44] the vine we are the branches now the
[1:40:46] vine does not bear fruit it's the
[1:40:48] branches
[1:40:49] but it gets its energy
[1:40:52] from the vine now Jesus doesn't have any
[1:40:55] hands on Earth but yours and mine he
[1:40:57] doesn't have any or any mouth on Earth
[1:40:58] but yours and mine then we become
[1:41:00] energized with the spirit of Christ and
[1:41:03] if the life that's in the vine is in the
[1:41:06] branch the branch will produce the
[1:41:09] fruits that's in the Vine where does our
[1:41:12] energy come from it says the energy

[1:42:15] energy the resurrection this body

[1:42:59] give me the energy to keep going you can
[1:43:01] stand with us as we bring this to a
[1:43:03] close

[1:43:08] it's the bride
[1:43:10] that is they'll hear that is now his
[1:43:12] body on Earth manifesting Jesus once
[1:43:15] again
[1:43:16] laughs
[1:43:18] brother Branham said
[1:43:20] Moses was the Vindication of the
[1:43:23] interpretation of the word
[1:43:25] he said Moses was God's interpretation
[1:43:28] of his promise
[1:43:30] then what are you
[1:43:32] but the interpretation
[1:43:34] of the promise that I will have a church
[1:43:37] without spot a wrinkle
[1:43:41] how can you have a spot if you're him
[1:43:44] how can you have a wrinkle if you're him
[1:43:47] quit looking at this
[1:43:49] in that day you shall know that I am in
[1:43:54] you and you are in me
[1:43:57] and we are one
[1:43:59] it's not you that doeth the work
[1:44:02] it's not your righteousness it's not the
[1:44:05] fact that you're wrinkle free or Spot
[1:44:06] Free
[1:44:10] and he just wants somebody
[1:44:12] that will Manna Fest
[1:44:16] I want to read this quote as I close
[1:44:21] Allelujah
[1:44:23] foreign
[1:44:26] somewhere in here
[1:44:30] what does it prove
[1:44:32] what all these things prove when you see
[1:44:34] a church begin to operate like he
[1:44:37] operated
[1:44:38] begin to overcome the way he overcame
[1:44:41] to do the works that he did it tells us
[1:44:44] that there's a match piece
[1:44:47] that's starting to come to Perfection on
[1:44:49] the Earth
[1:44:50] and if there's a match piece starting to
[1:44:52] come to Perfection on the earth it shows
[1:44:55] us that we're nearing the rapture
[1:44:57] because when he is fully manifested in a
[1:45:00] bride then the Capstone can come
[1:45:03] and then she can receive it
[1:45:05] but until she gets to that place
[1:45:08] she can't receive it
[1:45:09] there has to be a manifestation fully
[1:45:12] that matches who he is phone of his bone
[1:45:16] flesh of his flesh because he's coming
[1:45:17] back for a match piece but brother
[1:45:19] Branham says what does life in the body
[1:45:22] show
[1:45:25] he said his body was not held in the
[1:45:27] grave recognize with him in the
[1:45:29] resurrection same as he is now listen
[1:45:32] which means this his word which he is
[1:45:36] has begun to be risen the word that down
[1:45:40] through the age of Luther Wesley C has
[1:45:43] begun to raise up to its power there it
[1:45:46] began to move then it moved a little
[1:45:47] more now it's coming up to
[1:45:49] identification see watch now the life in
[1:45:52] the body is a Vindication that the
[1:45:55] Rapture is at hand when you see the
[1:45:58] headship and the body becoming one and
[1:46:01] the fullness of the measure of his
[1:46:02] manifestation shows that the body is
[1:46:06] about ready to be received
[1:46:08] to the headship
[1:46:10] Church where are we at
[1:46:12] how close are we I say Lord manifest
[1:46:15] your life through me more if that's what
[1:46:16] it takes manifest yourself in me
[1:46:18] manifest yourself in even like
[1:46:20] Tabernacle manifest yourself in your
[1:46:22] bride around the world life in the body
[1:46:24] shows that the body is rising up come on
[1:46:27] Church Life didn't come back into the
[1:46:29] body of Jesus so he could stay in the
[1:46:30] Tomb but life came in the body so that
[1:46:33] he could resurrect life came in the body
[1:46:35] so that he could come back and I say
[1:46:37] that life has once again come into the
[1:46:39] body of Jesus so that we can go home in
[1:46:42] a Rapture it's going home time it's time
[1:46:44] to manifest what we are and there will
[1:46:47] be nothing no greater manifestation that
[1:46:49] you are the Bride of Jesus Christ than
[1:46:51] the Rapture I'm telling you Jesus was so
[1:46:53] Vindicated that even those that couldn't
[1:46:54] accept him had to admit who he was
[1:46:56] Nicodemus said we know that you're a
[1:47:00] teacher from God the Centurion said
[1:47:02] surely this is the Son of God they
[1:47:04] couldn't accept it they didn't believe
[1:47:05] it but they had to testify of it and
[1:47:07] there's coming a day this bride will be
[1:47:09] so Vindicated they may not accept it
[1:47:11] they may not believe it but one day
[1:47:13] you're going to be gone and you know
[1:47:14] what they're going to say surely that
[1:47:17] was the Bride of Jesus Christ oh come on
[1:47:20] many claim to be the Christ many claim
[1:47:23] to be the Christ but only one manifested
[1:47:25] God and many have claimed to be the
[1:47:27] bride but there will come one who will
[1:47:30] manifest the Lord Jesus Christ I say be
[1:47:33] it unto me being unto me Lord Lord let
[1:47:36] me be that one there's been churches
[1:47:38] churches Brides bride but there must
[1:47:41] come one
[1:47:43] it might as well
[1:47:45] be me
[1:47:46] it might as well be you God bless you
[1:47:49] Church let's manifest Jesus
