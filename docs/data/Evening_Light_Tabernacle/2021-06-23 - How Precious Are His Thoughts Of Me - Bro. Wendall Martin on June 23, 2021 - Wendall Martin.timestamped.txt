[1:12:53] she is the work of her lord and all his
[1:12:56] works are perfect
[1:12:58] in fact in her is summed up and
[1:13:00] manifested the eternal wisdom and
[1:13:02] purpose of god
[1:13:03] how can one fathom it how can one
[1:13:05] understand it
[1:13:07] though we cannot do that we can accept
[1:13:10] it by faith
[1:13:12] for god has spoken
[1:13:17] can you say man you see sarah
[1:13:20] had to identify herself with the promise
[1:13:24] she went a long time identifying herself
[1:13:27] with barrenness
[1:13:29] she went for years but that did not
[1:13:31] change the mind of god
[1:13:35] brother wendell it's awfully
[1:13:37] embarrassing i
[1:13:38] i've been waiting for a long time and
[1:13:40] i've been claiming
[1:13:42] what's embarrassing about that that's
[1:13:45] showing your true
[1:13:46] colors more than it's ever shown
[1:13:50] because faith is patient faith don't
[1:13:53] care how long it's going to take
[1:13:55] faith is not looking at a calendar or a
[1:13:58] watch faith looks at the word
[1:14:02] and the word is only in the eternals
[1:14:07] the word is not subject to
[1:14:10] time place and material the word
[1:14:14] is he amen in the eternals above
[1:14:18] time above amen all of the pain that
[1:14:21] you're going through
[1:14:25] and the word is what you're standing on
[1:14:29] in those heavenly places brother branham
[1:14:32] says
[1:14:34] knowing who he was
[1:14:37] without a shadow of doubt he knew he was
[1:14:39] the son of god
[1:14:41] he knew it for the word identified it
[1:14:45] amen
[1:14:46] the word of god identified who he was he
[1:14:49] said i
[1:14:49] if i do not the works of my father then
[1:14:52] then don't believe me
[1:14:54] if i don't do them works don't believe
[1:14:56] me but if i do the works
[1:14:59] if but but then if i do then believe the
[1:15:01] works
[1:15:02] for they are the manifested word uh
[1:15:04] promised
[1:15:06] oh if i could just wake you up to that a
[1:15:08] minute
[1:15:09] you see the word itself identified him
[1:15:13] who is now the prophet's trying to tell
[1:15:14] us something the word
[1:15:16] itself was identifying him
[1:15:20] for who he was are you with me he says
[1:15:22] he turned around
[1:15:24] and said the works that i do
[1:15:27] shall you do also a little while in the
[1:15:31] world sees me no more
[1:15:32] yet you shall because i'll be with you
[1:15:35] even in you take no thought of what you
[1:15:36] shall say
[1:15:37] amen for it is not you that speak it
[1:15:40] it's my father that dwelleth
[1:15:42] in you on down he says now the
[1:15:44] identification
[1:15:45] of a scripture christian these words
[1:15:48] said jesus
[1:15:49] these signs shall follow
[1:15:52] them that believe how many believers do
[1:15:56] we have in the building
[1:16:01] oh isn't it good to have him be a
[1:16:03] believer
[1:16:04] well come on how would you like to be
[1:16:07] out there in one of those nominal
[1:16:08] churches
[1:16:12] i'm having to prepare to take off to the
[1:16:14] streets and riot and all this kind of
[1:16:16] stuff to stand up for your rights our
[1:16:20] rights have already been won
[1:16:23] jesus won our rights
[1:16:26] we have a hallelujah all right
[1:16:30] he says now how can you call yourself a
[1:16:31] believer of people and deny those words
[1:16:34] how can you call yourself a believer in
[1:16:35] an idea of this word
[1:16:37] you can't do it you're not a believer
[1:16:39] therefore signs can't follow
[1:16:40] because you just accept what you want to
[1:16:42] believe and then the rest of it well you
[1:16:44] don't believe it
[1:16:46] you've got to take the whole thing and
[1:16:48] believe it and when you truly believe
[1:16:50] not make believe but really believe
[1:16:52] then these signs shall follow them that
[1:16:53] believe whole could you compare a
[1:16:55] christian today with them christians
[1:16:56] long ago
[1:16:57] how their disciples walked in the spirit
[1:16:59] the power of the spirit moved by the
[1:17:01] holy ghost
[1:17:02] amen to do it just a prisoner as i
[1:17:05] preached the other night
[1:17:06] a prisoner to the word and the will of
[1:17:08] god wouldn't you like to see a church
[1:17:10] rise up like that
[1:17:11] it's going to it's going back it's
[1:17:14] got to come that was your chance that
[1:17:18] was your cue to jump the aisles and
[1:17:21] start shouting
[1:17:24] it's a promise to the believer
[1:17:30] oh what was the very first law of god
[1:17:32] faith
[1:17:34] faith god had to believe his own word
[1:17:37] faith could see it out there before it
[1:17:39] was there faith could speak it
[1:17:42] believe it and go rest amen
[1:17:45] knowing that it was coming
[1:17:48] faith wasn't making it come nor faith
[1:17:52] stood course because god's word
[1:17:55] had already spoken it what can you say
[1:17:58] man
[1:17:59] hallelujah oh glory i just want to i
[1:18:02] want to hit you hard here right now
[1:18:04] did you know that you're the very
[1:18:06] genetics of god
[1:18:09] hallelujah amen you're not a mixture of
[1:18:13] creed and dogma and and and
[1:18:15] denominations and teachings
[1:18:18] you are the germ seed word of god
[1:18:24] brother says when a baby is conceived in
[1:18:27] the womb of a mother
[1:18:29] when that one cell goes in there and
[1:18:30] another cell builds on top of that
[1:18:33] it's not one cell of a human the next of
[1:18:35] a dog and the next have a cat
[1:18:36] and the next if it's something else it's
[1:18:39] absolutely straightly human being
[1:18:41] and when a man is born of the spirit of
[1:18:43] god he don't inject anything into his
[1:18:45] life
[1:18:46] it's the unadulterated word of god
[1:18:49] vindicated for that hour
[1:18:51] he takes that full word of god he don't
[1:18:53] put no creeds nothing else to it
[1:18:55] it's purely unadulterated it is
[1:18:58] god's word made manifest among us
[1:19:07] now jesus said
[1:19:11] father keep them
[1:19:15] now he didn't say take the evil away
[1:19:19] he didn't say i'm going to keep them i'm
[1:19:21] going to take them out of this evil
[1:19:22] world
[1:19:24] he says father they're going out into
[1:19:27] the world
[1:19:30] but i've given them your word
[1:19:34] and as they use that word you're going
[1:19:37] to honor
[1:19:38] that word in their lives oh hallelujah
[1:19:42] yeah he could you know i'm a daddy
[1:19:45] and and i would love to shelter my boys
[1:19:48] bring them over
[1:19:49] and and keep them you know away from

[1:20:26] and god did not take us he did not save
[1:20:29] you
[1:20:29] and take you and keep you from the evil
[1:20:32] he didn't take you from the world

[1:20:35] community it's still in your job

[1:22:37] and as many as were ordained to eternal
[1:22:40] life
[1:22:42] believed as many as were ordained to
[1:22:45] eternal life that means somebody's got
[1:22:47] their names written in the lamb's book

[1:26:13] than anything of of of earthbound
[1:26:17] creatures
[1:26:19] but the snake can lure
[1:26:23] a bird down from the sky
[1:26:27] hallelujah brother branham says
[1:26:30] he says i'm told a snake can catch the
[1:26:32] eye of the burden charm the bird with
[1:26:34] his enchantments and the snare of its
[1:26:36] eyes until such a way
[1:26:39] if that bird will give this the snake
[1:26:42] its attention for just a few moments the
[1:26:44] bird will flutter
[1:26:45] and completely become paralyzed and the
[1:26:46] snake will take the bird
[1:26:48] i can believe that because that i know
[1:26:51] of another serpent the devil
[1:26:54] that if he could ever catch the eye with
[1:26:56] his enchantments
[1:26:57] with your modern rock and roll and all
[1:26:59] of your faint angles of the world
[1:27:01] if he can ever catch you young lady or
[1:27:03] young man just long enough
[1:27:04] to get his charm in you you'll flutter
[1:27:08] but you can't get loose he will hold you
[1:27:12] until he swallows you up in sin the only
[1:27:15] way i'm told that the little bird can
[1:27:16] ever have have a chance
[1:27:18] is to get his eyes off of the serpent he
[1:27:21] cannot look at
[1:27:22] anything else because he stands staring
[1:27:25] but if he will take his eyes from the
[1:27:27] serpent and
[1:27:28] look upward and flutter his wings he
[1:27:31] will fly
[1:27:32] plum out of the reach of the snake
[1:27:36] oh come on now amen uh

[1:27:42] little bit i'm going to turn cnn off for

[1:28:58] god was going to send strong delusion
[1:29:02] to the to the laodicea church
[1:29:06] hallelujah strong delusion that they
[1:29:08] would believe a lie
[1:29:10] and be damned by that lie but yet
[1:29:13] he has looked to his church i i read
[1:29:16] a scripture earlier today and i i
[1:29:18] thought it was good
[1:29:20] they're in in in psalms 180 or psalms 89
[1:29:23] and 33
[1:29:25] he says nevertheless my loving kindness
[1:29:27] will i not utterly take from him
[1:29:30] nor suffer my faith my faithfulness to
[1:29:33] fail
[1:29:34] my lips will i not break or my covenant
[1:29:36] will i not break nor alter the thing
[1:29:39] that has gone out of my lips
[1:29:40] once i have sworn by my holiness
[1:29:44] that i will not lie
[1:29:49] that i will not lie
[1:29:53] somebody say it with me that i will not
[1:29:57] lie unto david

[1:47:29] miracle-working god

[1:47:36] it doesn't matter hallelujah
[1:47:40] what does he think of me
[1:47:42] [Applause]
[1:47:47] i'm not saying that the battle don't get
[1:47:49] heavy
[1:47:51] i i'm not saying that you don't believe
[1:47:54] that you don't get bruised you i'm not
[1:47:58] saying that
[1:47:58] that you have to fight to keep a good
[1:48:00] spirit that you have to fight to keep
[1:48:03] your head what can you say man
[1:48:05] but i i just want to tell you god
[1:48:08] god's got a a bride on the earth that
[1:48:11] ain't going to turn
[1:48:12] tell and run amen
[1:48:16] can you say amen
[1:48:19] you know david
[1:48:22] and his men had went out warring and
[1:48:25] they came back from victory and when
[1:48:28] they came back they found ziggler
[1:48:30] burned and all of his 600 warriors all
[1:48:34] these none of these men all came in
[1:48:37] looking forward to seeing their families
[1:48:39] looking forward to seeing their wives
[1:48:40] and children
[1:48:42] receive the affection from them when
[1:48:45] they arrive their cities burn
[1:48:48] their wife and their children all the
[1:48:49] life's belongings are gone
[1:48:52] smoke still rising for the from the
[1:48:55] smolders
[1:48:57] and the scripture says that david's
[1:48:59] warriors turned on david
[1:49:02] and they were ready to stone david
[1:49:05] that's right come on
[1:49:09] and and what did
[1:49:13] what what you know sometimes we talk
[1:49:16] about the dedication of david's mighty
[1:49:18] men this this this was a
[1:49:19] this was a bad that was this was a bad
[1:49:20] deal going on in the church
[1:49:26] they have the stones in the hands the
[1:49:27] grief was so great they were ready
[1:49:29] to stone him to death but what did the
[1:49:31] scripture say
[1:49:33] david refused to come out of the
[1:49:36] heavenly places
[1:49:38] and that's what i admire about great
[1:49:41] generals
[1:49:42] who refuse to come out of those heavenly
[1:49:44] places
[1:49:45] when the battle gets strong and heavy
[1:49:48] that's when your pastor gets that's
[1:49:50] that's that's when the true colors begin
[1:49:52] to
[1:49:53] shine but that's that's that's the true
[1:49:56] colors is when a general and they're
[1:49:58] they're getting attacked and the enemy's
[1:50:00] hitting hard
[1:50:01] and you see a brother tim prutz standing
[1:50:03] up saying god is faithful
[1:50:05] and i'm not just going to say god's
[1:50:07] faithful i'm going to turn up my
[1:50:08] preaching
[1:50:09] on god is faithful
[1:50:14] when you when you see a ron spencer
[1:50:17] fighting every day for his life
[1:50:21] but he's standing there saying god
[1:50:24] is faithful
[1:50:26] [Applause]
[1:50:29] come on now when you see these men in
[1:50:32] the message
[1:50:33] if this thing was a fake and a frowny
[1:50:36] amen
[1:50:37] it would be exposed in these times where
[1:50:39] the supernatural
[1:50:41] has got to take place but brother this
[1:50:44] church knows too much
[1:50:45] we we know very much should i say that
[1:50:48] the supernatural is with this message
[1:50:52] [Applause]
[1:50:56] and david began to encourage himself in
[1:50:58] the lord
[1:50:59] what did he do he began to create
[1:51:01] another world
[1:51:03] i'm not going to look at this thing
[1:51:04] around me what can you say man
[1:51:07] hallelujah amen i want to just read a
[1:51:09] little bit to you but as a
[1:51:10] as as we get ready as i close there in
[1:51:13] first samuel 30 and one then david and
[1:51:15] the people that were with him lifted up
[1:51:16] their voices and wept until they could
[1:51:18] weep
[1:51:19] no more had no more power to weep
[1:51:21] david's two wives were taken
[1:51:22] captive captain amen sixth verse and
[1:51:26] david was greatly distressed for the
[1:51:28] people spake of stoning and the
[1:51:30] because the soul of the people was
[1:51:31] grieved and every man of for his sons
[1:51:33] and for his daughters and david
[1:51:35] encouraged himself
[1:51:36] in the lord his god and david said and
[1:51:39] the ether the
[1:51:40] the priest uh himilla ex uh
[1:51:43] son i pray thee bring me the ephod and
[1:51:46] happy i third brought
[1:51:47] hither the ephod to dave and david
[1:51:49] inquired at the lord saying shall i
[1:51:50] pursue this troop shall i overtake him
[1:51:52] and he answered pursue for thou shalt
[1:51:55] surely overtake them
[1:51:57] and without fail recover all
[1:52:04] but now there was only 400 who had the
[1:52:08] strength
[1:52:10] to go out and cover recover
[1:52:14] there were 200 that were weary
[1:52:18] they were tired
[1:52:21] and and the bible says that they were
[1:52:24] faint
[1:52:25] they said the 200 of old behind which
[1:52:28] were so faint that they could not go
[1:52:29] over
[1:52:30] the brook but the scripture says
[1:52:35] hallelujah the scripture says that when
[1:52:38] they were going after them are y'all
[1:52:40] still with me give me another five
[1:52:41] minutes
[1:52:42] they were gone after the enemy they're

[1:52:46] to read it to you it's a good it's a
[1:52:48] good read
[1:52:50] and they found an egyptian in the field
[1:52:52] and brought him to david and gave him
[1:52:53] bread and he did eat
[1:52:55] made him drink water and they gave him a
[1:52:58] piece of cake of fix now they found this
[1:53:00] man
[1:53:00] out on their way to to pursue after the
[1:53:03] enemy
[1:53:04] they gave him a figs cake of figs and
[1:53:06] cluster of raisins and
[1:53:08] when he had eaten his spirit came to him
[1:53:10] again and he for he had eaten no bread
[1:53:13] or drunk any water three days and three
[1:53:15] nights and david said unto him
[1:53:16] to whom belongs thou and when's heart
[1:53:18] thou and he said i'm a young man of
[1:53:20] egypt
[1:53:21] servant i'm an amalekite my master

[1:53:27] felt sick
[1:53:29] and he made him and we made an invasion
[1:53:31] of the south of the
[1:53:32] cherothites and the coast that belongs
[1:53:34] to judah and
[1:53:35] the south of caleb and we burned ziglag
[1:53:38] with fire and david said can you bring
[1:53:41] me to this company
[1:53:42] and he says swear unto me by god that
[1:53:44] thou will neither kill me
[1:53:46] nor deliver me into the hands of my
[1:53:48] master and i'll bring thee down
[1:53:52] the enemy ain't getting the enemy yeah
[1:53:54] they ain't got no time for you they'll
[1:53:55] just kick you off to the side can you
[1:53:56] say amen
[1:53:58] 17th verse and david and they well the
[1:54:01] 16th verse and when it brought them down
[1:54:02] behold they were spread or
[1:54:04] abroad upon all the earth eating and
[1:54:06] drinking and dancing and because of all
[1:54:08] the great spoil that they had taken out
[1:54:09] of the land of the
[1:54:10] philistines and out of the land of judah
[1:54:13] and david smote them from twilight even
[1:54:15] until the evening of
[1:54:17] the next day and there escaped not a man
[1:54:19] of them saved
[1:54:20] 400 young men which rolled upon camels
[1:54:23] and fled
[1:54:24] and david recovered all
[1:54:27] somebody say oh that the amalekites had
[1:54:30] carried away and david rescued his two
[1:54:32] wives
[1:54:34] and there was nothing lacking to them
[1:54:36] neither small
[1:54:37] or great neither sons nor daughters
[1:54:40] neither spoiled
[1:54:41] nor anything they had taken to them
