========================================
thank you though the storms keep on reaching in my life sometimes it's hard to tell the night for days still that hope lies within it's reassured as I keep my eyes upon that distance [Music] he has prepared oh but if the storms and if the winds keep all the blowing for my soul has been [Music] blowing in my life and sometimes it's so hard to tell the night from day still that hope that lies within me it's reassured when I keep my eyes upon that distance [Music] the storms won't cease [Music] [Music] [Music] if the winds keep on blowing in my life [Music] oh but if storm just won't cease and if the winds keep on blowing in my life [Music] yes my son foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music]
