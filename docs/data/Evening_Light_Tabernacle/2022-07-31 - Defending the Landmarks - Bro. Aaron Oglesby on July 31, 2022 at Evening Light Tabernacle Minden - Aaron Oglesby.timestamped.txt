[59:43] deuteronomy 19
[59:45] verse 14. we're going to speak to you a
[59:47] little bit today on
[59:49] defenders of the landmarks
[59:52] defenders of the landmarks
[59:55] the word says here
[59:57] thou shalt not remove thy neighbor's
[59:59] landmark
[1:00:00] which they of old time have set in thine
[1:00:03] inheritance which thou shalt inherit in
[1:00:06] the land that the lord thy god hath
[1:00:09] given thee to possess it in other words
[1:00:11] the landmarks that were set up indicated
[1:00:14] what belonged to you
[1:00:15] and for you to go and move a landmark
[1:00:18] was to take away from your brother's
[1:00:20] possession
[1:00:21] it was to take and and you pushed it a
[1:00:22] little bit this way and it took away
[1:00:24] from him and you moved it a little bit
[1:00:25] this way and it took away from him and
[1:00:27] the lord saying do not touch thy
[1:00:30] neighbor's landmark chapter 27 and verse
[1:00:33] 17 they're in the same book
[1:00:37] the lord shows us how serious he is
[1:00:39] about this
[1:00:40] cursed be he that removeth his
[1:00:43] neighbor's landmark
[1:00:45] and all the people shall say
[1:00:47] amen amen you can have your seats this
[1:00:50] morning pray that god has added his
[1:00:51] blessings
[1:00:52] to the reading of his word we're also
[1:00:54] going to read in one other place a very
[1:00:55] familiar scripture in the book of jude
[1:00:58] the first chapter and the third verse
[1:01:00] something that we're all very familiar
[1:01:02] with but it's going to be the
[1:01:04] cornerstone here of our message today it
[1:01:06] says beloved
[1:01:08] when i gave all diligence to write unto
[1:01:10] you of the common salvation
[1:01:12] it was needful for me to write unto you
[1:01:14] in other words i didn't just do it
[1:01:16] because i wanted to
[1:01:18] this was needful this had to happen
[1:01:21] it was needful for me to write unto you
[1:01:24] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[1:01:26] contend for the faith which was once
[1:01:29] delivered
[1:01:30] unto the saints
[1:01:33] looking here at this verse
[1:01:35] jude instructs us to contend for the
[1:01:38] faith
[1:01:39] that was once delivered
[1:01:42] the way this was this is worded would
[1:01:44] allow us to see and show us that things
[1:01:46] that all things have already begun to
[1:01:48] slide a little bit from the way they
[1:01:51] were established
[1:01:52] the relaxing that we know of that took
[1:01:55] place in that age has already begun and
[1:01:58] because jude is pointing back already to
[1:02:00] a faith that was once delivered in other
[1:02:03] words he's making a difference between
[1:02:05] how we're living right now the things
[1:02:07] that people are holding to right now
[1:02:09] versus what was delivered only a short
[1:02:12] time ago and he's pointing back and he's
[1:02:14] saying you got to contend for what was
[1:02:16] once delivered he's pointing them back
[1:02:19] and the word contend here means to
[1:02:21] strive or to vie in contest or rivalry
[1:02:25] or against difficulties church is not
[1:02:27] going to be easy to stand for everything
[1:02:29] that we believe in it's not going to be
[1:02:32] easy for us to to contend for the faith
[1:02:34] that was once delivered but he's saying
[1:02:36] you have to do it it's needful that you
[1:02:38] do it things are changing society is
[1:02:40] moving in a certain direction and you
[1:02:42] got to be willing to contend for the
[1:02:44] faith that was once delivered
[1:02:47] brother branham would say that the only
[1:02:49] way to know what faith we are to contend
[1:02:51] for is to look back to what jude is
[1:02:54] speaking of
[1:02:56] okay now this is just 33 years after
[1:02:59] pentecost and jude is a christian we
[1:03:02] know that and so he's not pointing back
[1:03:04] to some levitical law he's not pointing
[1:03:07] back to the faith of abraham he's not
[1:03:09] pointing he's pointing back to the upper
[1:03:11] room he's pointing back to the day of
[1:03:13] pentecost brother branham says he's
[1:03:15] pointing back to the inauguration of the
[1:03:17] church there on the day of pentecost
[1:03:21] he says now if we can find out and then
[1:03:23] he says remember this is just 33 years
[1:03:25] after the inauguration of the church at
[1:03:27] pentecost 33 years later there's been
[1:03:30] such a falling away till jude here under
[1:03:33] the inspiration of the holy spirit is
[1:03:35] sending letters to the churches to
[1:03:38] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:03:40] once delivered to the saints
[1:03:43] he says now if we can only find out what
[1:03:45] kind of faith the first saints had then
[1:03:48] we can find out what kind of faith to
[1:03:50] contend for
[1:03:52] now we find this to be the truth a lot
[1:03:54] of people have the content part right
[1:03:56] there's a lot of people willing to stand
[1:03:58] and fight for things there's a lot of
[1:04:00] christians out there willing to stand
[1:04:02] and fight for what their church says is
[1:04:04] the truth
[1:04:05] there's a lot of people marching in the
[1:04:06] streets and contending for their calls
[1:04:09] but he says if you know what to contend
[1:04:12] for
[1:04:13] in other words they're hitching their
[1:04:14] mules to the wrong wagon
[1:04:17] they're putting the content part out but
[1:04:18] what is it we're to contend for the
[1:04:21] faith that was once delivered exactly
[1:04:25] the way it was delivered
[1:04:27] he says but we must remember what kind
[1:04:28] of faith it was now let's just think
[1:04:31] about oh well the first thing a person
[1:04:33] ought to do the first subject the first
[1:04:35] thing we must do is repent
[1:04:38] the disciples taught repentance
[1:04:40] water baptism divine healing
[1:04:42] resurrection of the dead manifestation
[1:04:44] of the power of the holy ghost signs
[1:04:47] wonders spoke with tongues interpreted
[1:04:50] tongues cast out devils healed the sick
[1:04:52] open the blinded eyes saw visions is
[1:04:55] that right well this is 1900 years later
[1:04:58] we're still contending for the faith
[1:05:00] that was once delivered and god is
[1:05:03] confirming it
[1:05:04] so if what you're contending for doesn't
[1:05:07] do that if what you're contending for
[1:05:09] doesn't preach that you're not
[1:05:11] contending for the faith that was once
[1:05:13] delivered
[1:05:16] he says now
[1:05:18] he also promised that there would be a
[1:05:19] restoration of the faith we read over in
[1:05:22] jude he said earnestly contend for the
[1:05:25] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:05:26] saints
[1:05:27] now we're promised in malachi 4 by the
[1:05:30] same system that he always did that he
[1:05:32] would restore back to the original faith
[1:05:36] oh my back to the original seed back to
[1:05:39] the seed like it began on the day of
[1:05:41] pentecost back to the same doctrine word
[1:05:44] by word power by power spirit by the
[1:05:47] same thing just exactly like it was in
[1:05:49] the beginning through signs and wonders
[1:05:52] of the living presence
[1:05:54] of jesus christ
[1:05:56] church we're not contending today for
[1:05:58] dead letter
[1:05:59] we're not contending today just to have
[1:06:01] the correct doctrine although we should
[1:06:04] but we are contending today that that
[1:06:06] word in that letter and that doctrine
[1:06:08] will produce a living christ and it will
[1:06:10] produce exactly what it produced in the
[1:06:12] book of acts that is what we are
[1:06:14] contending for today that is going to
[1:06:17] produce
[1:06:18] exactly what it produced in the first
[1:06:20] age
[1:06:23] brother brown would tell us over and
[1:06:24] over again that if that vine ever put
[1:06:26] forth another branch
[1:06:28] it would write another book of acts
[1:06:32] and that is what we're contending for
[1:06:34] here as believers today
[1:06:36] and the reason that we have to contend
[1:06:38] for it is because there is a spirit
[1:06:41] that wants to fight against it
[1:06:44] there is a spirit that opposes that
[1:06:46] faith now notice it doesn't oppose faith
[1:06:50] matter of fact that spirit will promote
[1:06:52] faith
[1:06:53] but it will oppose that faith
[1:06:56] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:06:59] saints there's a spirit that's been here
[1:07:01] from the beginning to rob that faith out
[1:07:04] of the church
[1:07:06] and notice what makes it so difficult to
[1:07:08] notice is it is a religious spirit
[1:07:11] it is a spirit that will use quotes
[1:07:14] it is a spirit that will use scriptures
[1:07:17] it is very subtle but it will come in
[1:07:19] and line up quotes and it will line up
[1:07:21] scriptures in a way to attack the faith
[1:07:24] and it will try to drain the life out of
[1:07:26] the church not try to make you quit
[1:07:28] coming to church
[1:07:30] not quite you know it's not worried
[1:07:31] about your church attendance but it's
[1:07:33] trying to make it where you come to a
[1:07:34] place that's dead come to a place that's
[1:07:36] dried up come to a place where the life
[1:07:38] has been squeezed out of it but we got
[1:07:40] to be somebody that says i'm going to
[1:07:41] defend my rights i'm going to defend the
[1:07:44] faith as it was once given this place
[1:07:46] will not dry up we will not be cold we
[1:07:48] will not be formal we will not sit back
[1:07:50] and allow the life to be drained out of
[1:07:53] evening like tabernacle
[1:07:58] somebody is going to recognize this
[1:08:00] spirit
[1:08:01] for what it is
[1:08:03] they're not going to be deceived by it
[1:08:05] and they're going to stand against it
[1:08:07] and contend for the faith
[1:08:12] you know we're told in the in the word
[1:08:14] that it would be so close
[1:08:16] that it would deceive the very elect
[1:08:19] if
[1:08:21] if
[1:08:21] it were possible
[1:08:23] it does my heart good to know that it's
[1:08:25] not possible today
[1:08:27] that the elect will not be deceived in
[1:08:29] this age but she will stand against that
[1:08:31] antichrist spirit that's trying to come
[1:08:33] into the churches not only will she
[1:08:35] withstand it but she will overcome it in
[1:08:38] this day
[1:08:39] the word says to him that overcometh
[1:08:41] will i grant to sit with me that tells
[1:08:43] me somebody's going to overcome that
[1:08:45] tells me somebody in this age won't be
[1:08:47] deceived somebody in this age is going
[1:08:49] to stand against it call it out fight
[1:08:52] against it and attain their promise
[1:08:54] somebody's gonna rapture it might as
[1:08:56] well be me it might as well be you see
[1:08:59] yourself in the word and say i'll take
[1:09:01] that i'll stand for that i'll have that
[1:09:04] i will defend the landmarks
[1:09:11] there will be a bride on earth
[1:09:14] that has been restored back
[1:09:16] to the original faith by malachi 4.
[1:09:19] and when he comes she's going to be
[1:09:21] found operating in that faith
[1:09:25] and in so doing
[1:09:27] she will be producing what that faith
[1:09:29] produces
[1:09:31] there's going to be life in her church
[1:09:34] it's not just going to be some dead
[1:09:35] church that's coming to service after
[1:09:37] service nothing happening
[1:09:38] it's not going to be a he's not coming
[1:09:40] to marry a corpse
[1:09:42] but his bride is going to be alive
[1:09:44] there's going to be life there there's
[1:09:46] going to be healing there there's going
[1:09:48] to be salvation there there's going to
[1:09:50] be deliverance there there's going to be
[1:09:51] overcoming there there's going to be a
[1:09:53] life producing what that faith produces
[1:09:56] there's going to be people still being
[1:09:57] filled with the holy ghost there's going
[1:10:00] to be people receiving a refilling of
[1:10:01] the holy ghost there's going to be
[1:10:03] outpouring after outpouring there will
[1:10:06] be victory in her
[1:10:08] hallelujah i believe that
[1:10:11] and not only that not only will she have
[1:10:13] received but she will be found defending
[1:10:15] that faith
[1:10:16] she will be found standing for truth
[1:10:20] she will be defending the landmarks
[1:10:23] that god has put in place for his people
[1:10:26] amen
[1:10:27] i may come out of this
[1:10:34] amen defenders
[1:10:36] of the landmarks
[1:10:38] now faithfully holding
[1:10:41] to these ancient landmarks allows us
[1:10:44] to contend
[1:10:46] as jude commanded us to contend because
[1:10:48] we're still holding to what the word
[1:10:50] said hold on to
[1:10:52] it allows us to contend for the faith
[1:10:54] that was once delivered
[1:10:56] and as we said many cannot contend uh uh
[1:10:59] and the way they should because they
[1:11:00] don't know exactly what it is they're
[1:11:02] supposed to contend for
[1:11:04] okay the this faith though
[1:11:07] is not something that's in question
[1:11:09] this faith is an established faith
[1:11:12] with clear definitions
[1:11:14] and timeless standards
[1:11:16] that is the key and that's what messes
[1:11:18] man up as men don't believe in timeless
[1:11:20] standards they believe that it can be
[1:11:22] changed with society but these standards
[1:11:24] are timeless standards discernible
[1:11:27] boundaries biblically well defined
[1:11:30] landmarks
[1:11:33] landmarks are very important part of the
[1:11:35] land that we have been restored to
[1:11:38] because landmarks
[1:11:40] um indicate boundaries
[1:11:43] they indicate ownership they indicate
[1:11:46] what is yours
[1:11:47] what belongs to you
[1:11:49] they indicate where it is that you will
[1:11:51] be blessed
[1:11:53] in other words you are to possess
[1:11:55] everything that's within those
[1:11:56] boundaries everything within those
[1:11:58] landmarks but don't go down to egypt
[1:12:00] looking for your blessings
[1:12:02] don't get out of the promised land don't
[1:12:04] go outside of where the boundaries have
[1:12:07] been set up for your life and for the
[1:12:09] christian life yeah take everything
[1:12:11] that's yours possess more take this but
[1:12:13] know where the boundaries are
[1:12:16] know where the landmarks are because
[1:12:19] you're not going to be blessed outside
[1:12:20] of the land that god has given you and
[1:12:22] you also don't want to settle short of
[1:12:24] entering into that land as we've dealt
[1:12:26] with before
[1:12:27] but where god set for you to get get
[1:12:29] there
[1:12:30] where god said for you to go go there
[1:12:32] what god has given you to possess
[1:12:34] possess it don't be found standing there
[1:12:37] going i didn't know what to do the
[1:12:39] landmarks are clearly defined what
[1:12:41] you're supposed to possess is clearly
[1:12:42] defined what is yours is clearly defined
[1:12:45] and if you don't take it god's not going
[1:12:47] to say i'm sorry i didn't make it clear
[1:12:49] enough i didn't define enough i'm sorry
[1:12:51] i sent you a message that told you what
[1:12:54] to do how to overcome where to get where
[1:12:56] to go i say get there and when you get
[1:12:59] there defend it with all you are stand
[1:13:02] there with all you are don't back up
[1:13:04] don't back down don't give in we can't
[1:13:06] give in it's too late to give in it's
[1:13:09] yours but you got to possess the land
[1:13:18] you go about claiming what is yours and
[1:13:19] possessing the land
[1:13:21] you have to also be prepared
[1:13:24] to defend it from attacks
[1:13:27] because there's going to be those that
[1:13:28] come and say
[1:13:30] that's not yours
[1:13:33] you can't have that
[1:13:35] no no that's not for us
[1:13:38] that's for another age
[1:13:41] that was for another time
[1:13:43] the days of miracles has passed
[1:13:46] the days of salvation is over the lamb
[1:13:48] has left the mercy seat
[1:13:51] there's no there's no mercy for anybody
[1:13:53] else there's no grace for anybody else
[1:13:55] he's no longer interceding
[1:13:57] and yet the word says something
[1:13:59] different
[1:14:00] the word is clearly defined that those
[1:14:02] are things that i can have
[1:14:04] the word says that those things are
[1:14:06] might i don't know about you but i still
[1:14:07] need healing
[1:14:09] i still need deliverance
[1:14:11] i'm still holding on that the lamb's on
[1:14:13] the mercy seat cause i've got loved ones
[1:14:15] i'm gonna see saved
[1:14:17] i'm gonna see saved i'm gonna see saved
[1:14:20] and in order for that to happen there is
[1:14:22] mercy there is grace there is salvation
[1:14:27] i believe that with all my heart don't
[1:14:29] you dare let people put that in another
[1:14:31] age and say he's off the mercy seat i
[1:14:33] need mercy every day you need mercy
[1:14:36] every day
[1:14:37] our loved ones need his mercy and i say
[1:14:40] they'll have it i'm believing for that
[1:14:46] i'm willing to stand today
[1:14:48] and defend my rights
[1:14:50] and defend your rights
[1:14:52] to every redemptive blessing that jesus
[1:14:55] died for
[1:14:56] i'm going to stand there and defend it
[1:15:00] some say we believe in being converted
[1:15:03] we believe in accepting jesus christ as
[1:15:05] personal savior we believe him as son of
[1:15:07] god virgin born yes sir that's all right
[1:15:11] all those things that means you have a
[1:15:13] form of godliness
[1:15:15] but deny the power thereof
[1:15:17] when i say what do you think about
[1:15:19] divine healing
[1:15:21] praise the lord shouting
[1:15:24] all the miracles and signs and gifts
[1:15:27] back in the church
[1:15:29] oh well that was for another age just
[1:15:31] exactly what the holy spirit said would
[1:15:33] take place the holy ghost said they'll
[1:15:35] have a form of godliness but they will
[1:15:37] deny the power thereof he said from such
[1:15:40] turn away for this is just like janus
[1:15:42] and jamborees
[1:15:44] that withstood moses
[1:15:47] listen the landmarks are not to be moved
[1:15:49] cursed is the man that moves the
[1:15:51] landmarks
[1:15:52] if the word established something it is
[1:15:54] always established
[1:15:56] it's not up for debate because your
[1:15:58] church don't see it that way that's not
[1:16:00] how landmarks work
[1:16:02] it's not up for debate because it's no
[1:16:04] longer
[1:16:05] acceptable in society or because the
[1:16:07] norms of society have changed listen god
[1:16:11] established those landmarks
[1:16:14] he said i could have it i'll have all
[1:16:15] that he said i could have but i'll also
[1:16:17] understand not to step outside those
[1:16:19] boundaries because if he said
[1:16:21] something's wrong it's still wrong if he
[1:16:23] said he didn't like something 2000 years
[1:16:25] ago he still doesn't like it he's not
[1:16:27] like you and i he's jesus christ the
[1:16:30] same yesterday today and forever he
[1:16:34] doesn't change his mind about his word
[1:16:38] proverbs 22 28
[1:16:42] it says remove not
[1:16:44] the ancient landmark which thy fathers
[1:16:46] have set
[1:16:49] no notice he's not talking to the people
[1:16:50] that said them
[1:16:52] this happened generation before
[1:16:55] maybe more
[1:16:56] so the landmarks don't change generation
[1:16:59] to generation
[1:17:01] what's right don't change because
[1:17:02] there's a new generation
[1:17:05] remove not the ancient landmarks which
[1:17:06] thy fathers have set
[1:17:09] the next generation didn't get to decide
[1:17:11] where the boundaries laid
[1:17:14] and neither do we get to decide where
[1:17:16] the things in god's word get to be
[1:17:18] changed or moved
[1:17:19] that's not for us to decide the
[1:17:21] landmarks were set by god and we have no
[1:17:23] right to move them even a little bit
[1:17:26] they were established in god's immutable
[1:17:29] and unchanging word
[1:17:31] his boundaries do not drift or change
[1:17:33] from one generation to the next if it
[1:17:35] was wrong when god said it it's wrong
[1:17:37] today
[1:17:39] if god poured out his spirit one way in
[1:17:41] the bible he pours out his spirit that
[1:17:43] way today
[1:17:44] if the disciples had to be filled with
[1:17:46] the holy ghost then you have to be
[1:17:48] filled with the holy ghost now
[1:17:50] if it produces signs and wonders and
[1:17:51] tongues then it will produce signs and
[1:17:54] wonders and tongues now it does not
[1:17:56] change cursed is the man who moves the
[1:17:59] landmarks
[1:18:02] because heavens and earth may pass away
[1:18:04] but my word
[1:18:05] shall never pass away
[1:18:08] remove not
[1:18:09] the ancient
[1:18:10] landmarks the landmarks and the
[1:18:13] boundaries of society as we said are
[1:18:14] ever-changing
[1:18:16] constantly moving
[1:18:18] and if we as christians aren't careful
[1:18:19] we'll allow that mindset to bleed over
[1:18:21] into our life
[1:18:23] things that you never would have done
[1:18:24] when you first gave your heart to the
[1:18:26] lord suddenly eh
[1:18:28] yeah maybe that's not such a big deal
[1:18:30] but what it is is the smoke from the
[1:18:32] bottomless pit is constantly
[1:18:33] infiltrating everything and even us even
[1:18:36] us
[1:18:37] become affected by the smoke now we
[1:18:39] fight against him we don't let it
[1:18:40] overcome us but it will jade you and
[1:18:43] affect your thinking and affect the way
[1:18:44] you look at things if you are not
[1:18:46] careful
[1:18:47] you have to be aware of what's going on
[1:18:50] as a matter of fact not only do we have
[1:18:51] to recognize it but we have to
[1:18:53] constantly fight against it
[1:18:56] the the problem with the first age was
[1:18:58] they were aimed at and
[1:19:00] relaxed we can never become relaxed
[1:19:03] i want to tell you this morning if
[1:19:04] you're relaxed if you're sitting back
[1:19:05] and all is good and i'm part of the
[1:19:07] bride and my salvation is secure hey
[1:19:08] maybe all those things are true but you
[1:19:10] better wake up
[1:19:11] you better wake up and quit being
[1:19:13] relaxed you better draw your sword you
[1:19:14] better get ready to fight you can't
[1:19:16] slumber what meanest now oh sleeper
[1:19:18] you have to wake up and recognize that
[1:19:20] you're in a current going the wrong way
[1:19:22] there is a stream rushing straight
[1:19:24] towards hell it is a strong current it's
[1:19:26] society it's the current of the age it's
[1:19:28] the current of the day and we're
[1:19:30] fighting against it and it's a constant
[1:19:32] battle and it throws something in a
[1:19:33] stream that has no ability to fight and
[1:19:36] watch where it goes watch where it takes
[1:19:38] you you can't relax for a minute you
[1:19:40] gotta fight back you gotta push you
[1:19:42] gotta say that's a landmark and it's
[1:19:43] mine i'll have it that's a landmark and
[1:19:46] it's mine i'll have it you can't relax
[1:19:48] for a minute because the stream's
[1:19:49] leading straight to hell and it wants to
[1:19:51] take you there
[1:19:53] there can be no relaxing
[1:19:57] you have to fight against that current
[1:19:59] we're swimming upriver all the time
[1:20:02] but i'm thankful that we're anchored to
[1:20:04] a solid rock
[1:20:05] a rock that doesn't change a rock that
[1:20:07] we can withstand the currents
[1:20:10] that rocks there and if you anchor to it
[1:20:12] you'll be safe and secure you got to get
[1:20:14] to it you got to push to it you got to
[1:20:16] fight to it
[1:20:18] that's what happened to society
[1:20:23] they
[1:20:24] lose their anchor
[1:20:26] they pulled their anchor up
[1:20:28] you know for many years society
[1:20:32] and the landmarks of society
[1:20:34] stayed mostly unmovable
[1:20:37] for many many years and so because of
[1:20:39] that it produced a relatively stable
[1:20:42] place of living
[1:20:43] here on the earth
[1:20:45] and it's because society used to look to
[1:20:47] god
[1:20:49] this country used to look to god
[1:20:53] and because of this things like marriage
[1:20:57] excuse me things like marriage were
[1:20:59] landmarks
[1:21:01] they were landmarks they were a landmark
[1:21:03] of society
[1:21:04] it was what everybody expected
[1:21:07] and things like just shacking up with
[1:21:09] the person you you liked and having
[1:21:11] children out of wedlock was looked down
[1:21:13] upon
[1:21:15] but now they have completely flipped to
[1:21:17] where that is a landmark of our society
[1:21:20] that's how society operates
[1:21:23] and what does it produce
[1:21:26] you know there was a time where marriage
[1:21:27] was glorified
[1:21:30] there was a thing where
[1:21:31] where it was glorified and having
[1:21:33] children was glorified and raising them
[1:21:35] in the fear of admonition of the lord
[1:21:36] those things were landmarks
[1:21:38] but now i saw a statistic this morning
[1:21:40] that it blew my mind it said 75 of
[1:21:42] long-term
[1:21:44] correctional facility inmates
[1:21:46] are from fatherless households
[1:21:50] 75
[1:21:52] of all people in prison
[1:21:54] are from fatherless households it's what
[1:21:56] happens when you pull the anchor up and
[1:21:58] you let the current take you where it
[1:21:59] wants to take you
[1:22:02] 85 of kids
[1:22:04] who have behavioral disorders are from
[1:22:06] single-parent homes
[1:22:09] 85 percent of rapists
[1:22:13] are from fatherless homes
[1:22:17] the norms that god put in place weren't
[1:22:20] just there because
[1:22:24] they weren't this there because it's
[1:22:25] because god knew the beast nature of
[1:22:28] humanity
[1:22:29] and what humanity would do without norms
[1:22:32] that were set by god or landmarks that
[1:22:34] were set by god things that we were
[1:22:36] supposed to look to parenthood was once
[1:22:39] glorified
[1:22:40] and now we rage in the streets for the
[1:22:42] right to kill the unborn
[1:22:47] truth was valued
[1:22:50] now anti-moral propaganda
[1:22:52] fills our airwaves and our internet and
[1:22:54] has poisoned the world
[1:22:57] it has torn down the landmark of
[1:22:59] morality replaced it with the pursuit of
[1:23:01] lust
[1:23:02] and personal satisfaction
[1:23:07] american universities
[1:23:09] founded on christian ideals most of them
[1:23:13] over time they allowed men to get in
[1:23:14] there with corrupt minds and move their
[1:23:17] landmarks
[1:23:19] move what they stood for
[1:23:21] at one time they were actually the
[1:23:23] center of genuine christian thought and
[1:23:25] expression imagine that i'm talking
[1:23:27] about our universities
[1:23:32] christian thought and expression
[1:23:35] and yet they've allowed the landmark
[1:23:36] stones to be moved over into the
[1:23:39] bottomless pit of intellectual atheism
[1:23:42] where there is no return from
[1:23:46] allowing the boundary stones to be moved
[1:23:48] has allowed the whole world to go
[1:23:50] completely insane there's no truth in
[1:23:53] politics there's no truth in schools
[1:23:56] there's no morality you can't hardly
[1:23:58] recognize the country that we live in
[1:24:00] anymore
[1:24:01] you can't hardly recognize the world
[1:24:03] that we live in anymore because they
[1:24:05] pulled the anchor
[1:24:06] they walked away from the absolute
[1:24:09] they moved the boundary stones that were
[1:24:11] placed there by god listen a hundred
[1:24:13] years ago they could have never saw this
[1:24:17] 50 years ago most people would have
[1:24:19] never saw where we're at today but god
[1:24:21] knew and a prophet knew
[1:24:23] a prophet knew exactly where it was
[1:24:25] hidden
[1:24:27] brother brown says let me prophesy
[1:24:29] something to you
[1:24:30] just before it comes to pass the whole
[1:24:32] world is groping in insanity and it will
[1:24:35] get worse and worse and worse until
[1:24:38] there are a bunch of maniacs and it's
[1:24:40] almost that way
[1:24:42] now that's why you can't let the
[1:24:45] landmarks be moved
[1:24:47] even if it's just a little bit
[1:24:50] that's why we have to return back to the
[1:24:52] landmarks and not just return back but
[1:24:54] be willing to defend them be willing to
[1:24:56] stand be willing to take whatever shame
[1:24:59] and whatever name call it and holy
[1:25:01] roller in old fashion i don't care what
[1:25:03] you call me i'm standing on a landmark
[1:25:05] i'm standing on a promise i'm standing
[1:25:08] on the word call me what you want to
[1:25:10] call me this right here backs me up this
[1:25:12] is my vindication this told me to stand
[1:25:14] there this told me i could have it this
[1:25:17] is my land where is your vindication
[1:25:21] i'll stand on this
[1:25:23] all day every day
[1:25:30] we can't give a little bit here
[1:25:32] and give a little bit there
[1:25:34] we have to contend for it how it was
[1:25:36] delivered
[1:25:37] oh brother aaron that's too
[1:25:39] old-fashioned
[1:25:40] i didn't place the stone
[1:25:45] you know it doesn't even matter if i
[1:25:46] like it
[1:25:49] god placed the stone there
[1:25:52] god put the put the landmark there
[1:25:55] not me
[1:25:57] you know the devil may say i'm just
[1:25:58] wanting to move it just a little bit
[1:26:01] he got eve with one word
[1:26:04] one
[1:26:05] word
[1:26:06] she disbelieved one word you can't move
[1:26:09] the landmark even a little bit
[1:26:11] he got her to move it just a little bit
[1:26:12] a little bit of reasoning
[1:26:14] a little bit of wondering a little bit
[1:26:16] too relaxed with the conversation she
[1:26:18] was having about the word
[1:26:20] you can't relax
[1:26:22] we have to contend
[1:26:24] you have to be willing to fight
[1:26:26] listen
[1:26:27] here's what i don't think people realize
[1:26:28] and what i'm trying to get across even
[1:26:30] this morning is his end game isn't to
[1:26:32] take your joy
[1:26:34] his end game isn't to cause a little bit
[1:26:36] of rebellion in your home
[1:26:38] his end game isn't just to keep you from
[1:26:40] speaking in tongues that's not his
[1:26:42] endgame his endgame is a total
[1:26:44] annihilation of you and what you believe
[1:26:47] and this bride that he sees standing on
[1:26:49] the earth his end game is to wipe you
[1:26:51] out
[1:26:52] his desire is total destruction
[1:26:56] it is very serious
[1:26:59] that's the endgame
[1:27:01] that's what he's pushing for and there
[1:27:03] must come a recognition that it's not
[1:27:05] just a little thing it's not just
[1:27:07] innocent
[1:27:08] a recognition of what is it he's trying
[1:27:10] to do to me what's he trying to do to my
[1:27:12] family what's he trying to do to this
[1:27:14] church what's he trying to do to the
[1:27:15] believers he's trying to stop the
[1:27:17] rapture he's trying to stop your victory
[1:27:20] he's trying to stop you from possessing
[1:27:21] it but this bride will not fall she is
[1:27:25] predestinated not to fall she's not like
[1:27:28] the other eve but she's going to
[1:27:29] recognize she's going to withstand she's
[1:27:32] going to be found standing at the
[1:27:33] landmarks defending them
[1:27:35] [Applause]
[1:27:40] look it's worth fighting for
[1:27:43] if he said tongues i'll fight for it
[1:27:46] if he said be filled with the holy ghost
[1:27:48] i'll fight for it
[1:27:50] if he said the works that i do shall you
[1:27:52] do also i'll fight for it
[1:27:54] if he said men should dress one way and
[1:27:56] women should dress another way i'll
[1:27:57] stand for it
[1:28:00] i didn't put the stone there
[1:28:04] because there are those that want to
[1:28:05] move the stones
[1:28:07] they want to move the landmarks
[1:28:09] jude said content
[1:28:11] this wasn't a friendly letter
[1:28:14] he ain't worried about hurting brother
[1:28:15] so-and-so's feelings
[1:28:18] he said fight
[1:28:19] if they're an air fight
[1:28:21] if they're not where it's supposed to be
[1:28:23] if they're preaching untruths fight
[1:28:26] stand
[1:28:27] contend
[1:28:30] hosea 5 and 10 says the princes of judah
[1:28:33] were like them
[1:28:35] that removed the bound
[1:28:37] therefore i will pour out my wrath upon
[1:28:39] them
[1:28:40] like water
[1:28:43] they are like those that remove the
[1:28:45] bound bound here means the ancient
[1:28:47] landmarks
[1:28:49] god has given them his law to be offense
[1:28:51] about his own property
[1:28:53] and yet they sacrilegiously broke
[1:28:55] through it
[1:28:56] they set it aside they've encroached
[1:28:58] even upon god's rights they've been
[1:29:00] trampled upon the distinction between
[1:29:02] good and evil
[1:29:03] in them and the sacred obligation
[1:29:06] of reason and equity and thinking
[1:29:09] because they were princes they thought
[1:29:11] we can do whatever we want
[1:29:13] they're the princes of judah we don't
[1:29:15] have to abide by that
[1:29:17] that doesn't apply to us
[1:29:19] and god lets them know quickly it
[1:29:21] doesn't matter who you are
[1:29:23] i set the landmarks
[1:29:25] and because you've done this i'm going
[1:29:26] to pour out my wrath upon you like water
[1:29:30] there are those that will move the
[1:29:32] landmarks
[1:29:34] which means there have to be those that
[1:29:36] will defend them
[1:29:39] that'll stand and identify all that god
[1:29:41] has given and say no no no that belongs
[1:29:44] to me
[1:29:45] that's mine and i'm not going to allow
[1:29:47] you to take it this this portion belongs
[1:29:50] to the bride you can't take that away
[1:29:52] from us
[1:29:53] look we're sitting here we're reading
[1:29:54] from the book of jude which was written
[1:29:56] in 66 a.d
[1:29:58] so we know that it was written during
[1:29:59] the first church age
[1:30:01] because that first church age extended
[1:30:02] from 53 a.d all the way up to 170 a.d so
[1:30:05] we're here in the first church age
[1:30:08] and knowing that they they were
[1:30:10] the seed
[1:30:12] that was to be planted
[1:30:14] and that in the last day
[1:30:16] that seed comes forth and manifest what
[1:30:18] that seed was
[1:30:20] back to the original again
[1:30:22] it would behoove us to see how the enemy
[1:30:24] attacked
[1:30:26] them
[1:30:27] what worked against them
[1:30:29] what brought them down
[1:30:32] what is it that brought them down
[1:30:34] because
[1:30:35] what we see here is we need to see where
[1:30:37] the attacks were laid and how they went
[1:30:39] from the church that was in the upper
[1:30:41] room
[1:30:42] to where we see them over in revelation
[1:30:44] it says they're the cage of every
[1:30:45] unclean and hateful
[1:30:47] how
[1:30:49] what started that slide
[1:30:51] what started that progression
[1:30:54] oh brother aaron that would never happen
[1:30:57] here
[1:30:59] that would never happen in evening light
[1:31:01] tabernacle
[1:31:03] that would never happen in this message
[1:31:08] it happened in the first age
[1:31:10] we're talking about the age of paul
[1:31:13] the age of peter
[1:31:15] we're talking about the age of stephen
[1:31:19] what an age
[1:31:20] what people what messages the new
[1:31:23] testament
[1:31:25] it happened there
[1:31:32] it happened in the very age that we're
[1:31:33] aspiring to be like
[1:31:36] oh we're aspiring to be like them well
[1:31:38] brother brown said that's what the
[1:31:40] church was at pentecost is the standard
[1:31:43] that is the pattern he says there is no
[1:31:46] other pattern
[1:31:49] and in the very pattern
[1:31:51] satan was able to worm his way in
[1:31:54] jude writing only 33 years post
[1:31:56] pentecost and he's having to tell the
[1:31:57] people we've got to get back to
[1:31:59] pentecost
[1:32:00] we've got to get back to the upper room
[1:32:03] he says we have to fight for what we
[1:32:04] used to have
[1:32:06] and here we are in 2022 many many many
[1:32:09] years from that but many many years even
[1:32:12] from the opening of the word from this
[1:32:14] message that was delivered in its purity
[1:32:16] and i'm saying we got to get back to the
[1:32:18] landmarks we got to get back to the
[1:32:20] message the way it was delivered we got
[1:32:22] to get back to the message in its power
[1:32:24] we got to get back to the message and
[1:32:25] its dynamics and its mechanics we got to
[1:32:28] get back the way it was presented to us
[1:32:31] not the way we think it should be or how
[1:32:33] it makes us comfortable
[1:32:35] if you're comfortable you're relaxed and
[1:32:37] if you're relaxed you're sliding if
[1:32:38] you're sliding you're on your way down
[1:32:40] just like the first age you can't be
[1:32:43] relaxed
[1:32:44] how was it delivered to us
[1:32:48] you must defend the landmarks you can't
[1:32:50] sit back and allow that same spirit that
[1:32:52] came in that first aid so subtle
[1:32:55] we can't sit back and let it rob our
[1:32:57] worship
[1:32:58] read the church age book that's what it
[1:33:00] did it made the worship cold and formal
[1:33:02] it robbed the life out of the
[1:33:06] congregation you can't sit back and
[1:33:08] allow it to rob your praise
[1:33:11] sit back and allow it to get even a
[1:33:12] little foothold
[1:33:14] church it's all at stake
[1:33:17] these aren't games this isn't my church
[1:33:19] versus your church or preach this to
[1:33:21] rebuke this pastor it has nothing to do
[1:33:23] with that it's standing for truth it's
[1:33:25] standing for righteousness it's standing
[1:33:27] for the word it's standing for the
[1:33:29] landmarks
[1:33:31] it's all at stake your soul is at stake
[1:33:33] your kids are at stake your home's a
[1:33:34] stake the rapture of the church is at
[1:33:37] stake the landmarks matter the truth
[1:33:40] matters we can't give any of it
[1:33:46] he says the time has come that god will
[1:33:48] gather his people together
[1:33:50] under one great big banner of the lord
[1:33:52] jesus christ and pour out his powers
[1:33:54] among them
[1:33:56] and great signs and wonders will take
[1:33:58] place
[1:33:59] the time has come the time has come for
[1:34:01] the pentecostal church to make a stand
[1:34:03] the time has come to circumcise the
[1:34:05] church and cull all this foolishness the
[1:34:08] time has come to go back to the old
[1:34:10] landmark
[1:34:11] the time has come for the outpouring the
[1:34:13] time has come for the gathering of the
[1:34:15] people the time has come for jesus to
[1:34:17] come the time will be here soon oh
[1:34:20] someone else's the time has come we're
[1:34:22] at the end time if we're ever going to
[1:34:24] do anything brethren we're going to do
[1:34:26] it now
[1:34:27] the time
[1:34:29] is at hand
[1:34:32] should we stand brother aaron now's the
[1:34:33] time to stand
[1:34:34] when should we fight now is the time to
[1:34:36] fight you don't do it when you recognize
[1:34:38] oh we got to get back
[1:34:39] you don't do it when you recognize oh my
[1:34:41] goodness we've become cold and formal
[1:34:44] oh my goodness you do it when you see
[1:34:46] one little bitty thing when you see that
[1:34:48] first sprout when you hear that first
[1:34:50] word that's against when you hear that
[1:34:52] first word that moves a landmark when
[1:34:54] you hear that first word that robs your
[1:34:55] joy that first word that robs your
[1:34:57] freedom to praise that very first thing
[1:35:00] you stand up and you say no
[1:35:01] there's a landmark in the word i can
[1:35:03] have it i can have my peace i can have
[1:35:06] my children i can have my joy i'm gonna
[1:35:08] kill it now i'm not gonna wait i'm going
[1:35:10] on the attack now i'm a defender of the
[1:35:13] landmarks
[1:35:15] i am a defender of the landmarks
[1:35:19] hallelujah
[1:35:24] that first aid started with so much zeal
[1:35:27] it started with fire it started in the
[1:35:28] upper room there were signs and wonders
[1:35:31] and the power of god was undeniable
[1:35:34] but slowly they became relaxed
[1:35:38] we know the name ephesus actually means
[1:35:40] aimed at and relaxed
[1:35:43] we must guard against relaxing
[1:35:45] i'm not telling you you're out sinning
[1:35:47] and we're not talking about that
[1:35:49] i'm telling you you got to guard against
[1:35:50] relaxing
[1:35:53] for letting down your guard for even a
[1:35:54] minute
[1:35:57] we have to guard against it listen had
[1:35:59] paul still been on the scene he had
[1:36:00] cried out against it he said when i'm
[1:36:02] off the scene wolves are going to come
[1:36:04] in he already knew
[1:36:06] had peter still been there he'd have
[1:36:07] cried out against it had the other
[1:36:09] apostles still been on earth they would
[1:36:11] have cried out against it there to
[1:36:12] recognize it but a generation rose up
[1:36:15] that wasn't part of the upper room
[1:36:19] a generation rose up that the upper room
[1:36:20] was just stories
[1:36:22] this is what god did
[1:36:24] this is what he did at pentecost instead
[1:36:27] of writing their own book of acts
[1:36:28] instead of continuing the book of acts
[1:36:31] a generation rose up and they looked
[1:36:33] back at the upper room as a good story
[1:36:38] they look back at the healing revivals
[1:36:40] of the 50s and 60s as a good story
[1:36:46] they look back as azusa street now as
[1:36:48] something that they don't even want
[1:36:51] i'm sorry god thought it needed
[1:36:52] restoring
[1:36:54] i guess he let you know that he was just
[1:36:55] kidding
[1:36:58] he restored it but you don't need it
[1:37:00] that's odd
[1:37:03] they just look
[1:37:04] back they look back
[1:37:07] and they never experienced it for
[1:37:08] themselves
[1:37:11] it came in so simple
[1:37:13] they relaxed it came in so innocent
[1:37:15] brother brown speaks of all these things
[1:37:16] in the church book
[1:37:18] you know
[1:37:19] they probably presented it to the people
[1:37:21] as this is more balanced
[1:37:24] we need a balance to this
[1:37:27] and slowly they toned the worship down
[1:37:31] man began to control the way the
[1:37:33] services were
[1:37:34] instead of the spirit controlling it
[1:37:38] he says oh it started so small so
[1:37:40] quietly so inoffensively
[1:37:42] it looked so good
[1:37:45] he's talking about to the believers it
[1:37:48] looked good
[1:37:49] it looked right
[1:37:51] it seemed so sound
[1:37:54] then it caught a hold and like a python
[1:37:56] it squeezed out the very breath
[1:37:59] and killed all the spirituality there
[1:38:02] was in the church
[1:38:06] my how from this pulpit
[1:38:09] and many other pulpits across
[1:38:11] the country
[1:38:12] we've cried out against it over
[1:38:14] and over
[1:38:15] and over we're not the only ones there's
[1:38:17] many
[1:38:18] many standing and crying out against it
[1:38:20] don't let yourself become cold don't let
[1:38:23] the church become formal and there's
[1:38:25] going to continue to be a cry that goes
[1:38:26] out we're going to continue to crowd
[1:38:28] against it why because the spirit's
[1:38:30] trying to choke the life out of you
[1:38:33] there's men on the watchtower and they
[1:38:34] see what's happening they see the spirit
[1:38:36] trying to creep in you know where why
[1:38:39] constantly why constantly why constantly
[1:38:41] the spirit is knocking at the door death
[1:38:43] lies at the door and is wanting you to
[1:38:45] get comfortable it's wanting you to
[1:38:46] relax it's wanting you to go service
[1:38:48] after service if it's okay if the spirit
[1:38:49] didn't move it's okay while we heard
[1:38:51] some good word
[1:38:55] and you get comfortable
[1:38:56] and you get relaxed and soon that
[1:38:59] becomes the norm and an outpouring of
[1:39:01] the holy ghost becomes something just
[1:39:02] special that happens once a year
[1:39:06] that's not how i want my church
[1:39:08] but it's how the devil wants it
[1:39:14] surely brother aaron
[1:39:15] in our ranks and amongst our people
[1:39:17] there really aren't that many pushing
[1:39:19] for formalism and pushing these things
[1:39:22] that you warn of
[1:39:23] it's not about how
[1:39:24] many it isn't about pushing back against
[1:39:27] certain preachers that has nothing to do
[1:39:29] with and if that is anything in
[1:39:32] in my
[1:39:33] motive
[1:39:34] then god forgive me
[1:39:37] it has nothing to do about pushing back
[1:39:39] against certain preachers it's about
[1:39:41] that spirit that's trying to worm its
[1:39:42] way in
[1:39:43] it's about that spirit trying to get a
[1:39:45] hold once again it saw what worked in
[1:39:47] the first age
[1:39:49] it saw what worked there and it says uh
[1:39:52] this will get them
[1:39:53] formality coldness oh let's just focus
[1:39:57] on the word focus on the mechanics focus
[1:40:00] focus and you're lulled to sleep and
[1:40:03] next thing you know the spirituality in
[1:40:04] the church is gone
[1:40:09] man has a tendency to relax
[1:40:11] a tendency to get too comfortable and
[1:40:13] slowly drift
[1:40:14] from that zeal
[1:40:16] and in so doing others come in and they
[1:40:18] began to move the landmarks
[1:40:20] it came so subtle to that first age but
[1:40:22] it didn't take long until that age was
[1:40:24] completely unrecognizable
[1:40:28] that's what he wants it even like
[1:40:30] tabernacle
[1:40:31] unrecognizable
[1:40:33] brother branham says repent quickly
[1:40:35] don't hesitate
[1:40:36] evidently ephesus did hesitate for her
[1:40:39] life span was not very long the glory of
[1:40:42] god decreased ever so rapidly it was not
[1:40:44] long until the city was in ruins its
[1:40:46] glorious temple became a shapeless mass
[1:40:49] the land became a marsh inhabited by
[1:40:51] waterfowl the population was gone except
[1:40:53] for a few unbelievers in the village
[1:40:56] there was not
[1:40:58] one
[1:40:59] christian
[1:41:00] left
[1:41:02] ephesus
[1:41:05] ephesus
[1:41:07] there was not one
[1:41:10] christian
[1:41:11] left
[1:41:14] unrecognizable
[1:41:16] just a story of what happened at ephesus
[1:41:19] just a story of what they used to
[1:41:21] believe in ephesus
[1:41:23] and from this point on the stones began
[1:41:25] to be moved
[1:41:26] the landmark slowly began to move a
[1:41:28] little here and move a little there
[1:41:31] the landmark of baptism in the name of
[1:41:33] jesus christ would go on for 300 years
[1:41:36] 300 years from the book of acts
[1:41:40] to nicea council
[1:41:42] christians
[1:41:43] were baptized in the name of jesus
[1:41:45] christ you can look it up yourself it's
[1:41:46] not something i'm making up it's not a
[1:41:48] pet doctrine 300 years matter of fact
[1:41:52] you can't find one person in the bible
[1:41:54] not baptized in the name of the lord
[1:41:55] jesus christ
[1:41:57] not
[1:41:58] one
[1:41:59] but you get 300 years down and rome
[1:42:01] takes that
[1:42:02] that landmark and says
[1:42:04] we're gonna move it
[1:42:05] and how do they move it according to
[1:42:06] scripture
[1:42:08] they took a scripture
[1:42:10] and used that scripture to move the
[1:42:12] landmark
[1:42:14] listen it doesn't matter how long ago it
[1:42:16] was that they'd done away with it
[1:42:18] it doesn't matter how long or how many
[1:42:20] people get baptized in that name and
[1:42:22] that way in those titles it will never
[1:42:24] be the scriptural landmark that that god
[1:42:27] put in the word
[1:42:28] they can do it for thousands upon
[1:42:30] thousands upon thousands of years and
[1:42:31] it'll never change what god said
[1:42:34] peter there giving the keys to the
[1:42:36] kingdom he comes out of the upper room
[1:42:37] just been filled with the baptism of the
[1:42:40] holy ghost one of the greatest events
[1:42:42] recorded in the bible he comes down and
[1:42:44] he's asked a question how are we to be
[1:42:46] saved
[1:42:47] how many would like to know how to be
[1:42:48] saved i think that's all of our hearts
[1:42:51] and he says repent every one of you and
[1:42:54] be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:42:57] jesus christ and you shall receive the
[1:43:00] gift of the holy ghost and the promises
[1:43:03] unto you
[1:43:05] and to your children
[1:43:07] and to those that are afar off brother
[1:43:09] branham said that meant the gentiles
[1:43:11] that's the promise for you be baptized
[1:43:14] in the name of the lord jesus christ you
[1:43:16] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:43:18] they can change it to titles they can
[1:43:20] move the landmark where they want i'll
[1:43:22] stand right here where the word of god
[1:43:24] placed it and i'll defend the landmark
[1:43:26] of baptism
[1:43:33] the truth of the godhead was moved
[1:43:36] the landmark of justification was moved
[1:43:41] the landmark of sanctification was moved
[1:43:44] and in their place came man-made creeds
[1:43:46] and man-made dogmas
[1:43:48] proper worship in spirit and truth was
[1:43:51] moved
[1:43:53] the property stolen from the believers
[1:43:57] the supernatural moving of the spirit
[1:43:59] amongst the people was moved
[1:44:01] and they set up their own landmark
[1:44:03] to where god only spoke through the
[1:44:05] priesthood
[1:44:08] he says all right what was the spiritual
[1:44:10] climate of that church it had left its
[1:44:12] first love
[1:44:13] leaving his first love of the word of
[1:44:14] god was revealed to us as having fallen
[1:44:16] from its origin which was pentecost in
[1:44:20] plain english that means this church was
[1:44:22] in danger of being taken away from the
[1:44:23] leading of the holy spirit
[1:44:25] the control of the spirit
[1:44:27] that false vine was getting a hold and
[1:44:29] it was teaching that rulership by man
[1:44:31] was right it taught that the church had
[1:44:33] to be governed
[1:44:35] it taught a control over the people but
[1:44:37] instead of doing it's god's way they
[1:44:39] simply took authority invested all the
[1:44:41] spiritual power in their own hands and
[1:44:43] came out with a holy priesthood standing
[1:44:45] between god and the people he says and
[1:44:48] even right today
[1:44:50] among those who claim to be free
[1:44:53] and full of the spirit there is not too
[1:44:55] much freedom in the laity
[1:44:58] that would be you
[1:45:01] and the best we can see is a few
[1:45:03] preachers with inspired preaching while
[1:45:05] the flock just sits there and tries to
[1:45:07] absorb it now i'm not saying it's you as
[1:45:09] in it's your fault that's not what i
[1:45:10] meant
[1:45:11] i'm saying what they did was they took
[1:45:13] it away so much and they withhold the
[1:45:15] freedom from the laity they hold it to
[1:45:18] themselves and if somebody starts to get
[1:45:20] loose a little bit no no no no
[1:45:22] no no no
[1:45:24] no no no no
[1:45:27] you know that you know why the devil's
[1:45:28] so afraid of screaming and shouting
[1:45:30] i read something the other day i liked
[1:45:32] it it's not spiritual at all but
[1:45:35] i made it spiritual
[1:45:38] just being honest i was reading about a
[1:45:40] battle in the civil war
[1:45:41] and some of these yankees blessed their
[1:45:43] heart
[1:45:45] they was writing about the rebel yell
[1:45:49] and they said it sent chills up your
[1:45:50] spine
[1:45:51] they said it put fear into your heart
[1:45:54] and the guy said what was it about the
[1:45:56] sound he said the sound didn't have
[1:45:57] nothing to do with it
[1:45:59] he said it's because we knew what came
[1:46:01] after
[1:46:03] [Applause]
[1:46:04] whoo let somebody get loose in church
[1:46:06] let us shout go forth let us scream go
[1:46:09] out the devil ain't scared of your shout
[1:46:11] he ain't scared of your screams but he
[1:46:13] knows what's coming after he knows
[1:46:15] there's freedom he knows there's healing
[1:46:18] he knows there's deliverance he's afraid
[1:46:20] of what's coming after
[1:46:22] glory i say let him hear you i say let
[1:46:25] him know i'm coming i'm coming i'm
[1:46:28] coming for my kids i'm coming for the
[1:46:30] rapture i'm coming
[1:46:33] hallelujah
[1:46:35] glory to god he's worried about what
[1:46:37] comes after
[1:46:41] [Applause]
[1:46:45] i liked it too
[1:46:51] it all started so innocent
[1:46:53] brother aaron why you cry out against
[1:46:55] these things is it really that big a
[1:46:57] deal yes it's a big deal
[1:46:59] the church was given boundaries drawn by
[1:47:02] god
[1:47:03] the word of god laid down certain
[1:47:04] landmarks and we're not at liberty to
[1:47:06] move them no more than the children of
[1:47:08] israel were at liberty to move those
[1:47:10] stones
[1:47:11] cursed is the man
[1:47:15] these are not only lines that demo
[1:47:17] denote what is yours
[1:47:19] but there's also lines of separation
[1:47:22] that gets sticky brother aaron okay it's
[1:47:24] true
[1:47:25] they're lines of separation
[1:47:27] that are not to be blurred
[1:47:29] and they're not to be moved
[1:47:31] don't give up an inch content
[1:47:33] keep it in your heart content fight for
[1:47:36] those landlords
[1:47:39] we have to contend for the established
[1:47:40] landmarks
[1:47:42] of the word or we will be destroyed
[1:47:45] look i keep trying to get the
[1:47:46] seriousness of it to you he's not just
[1:47:48] trying to make you a backslider
[1:47:50] he's not just trying to get he wants to
[1:47:52] destroy you
[1:47:54] all those countries around israel we'll
[1:47:56] get to that later they don't just want a
[1:47:58] little piece of their land they want
[1:47:59] them wiped off the face of the earth
[1:48:02] and the attitude towards physical israel
[1:48:04] is the same as towards spiritual israel
[1:48:07] he wants to destroy you
[1:48:12] if you give up anything you will be
[1:48:13] unrecognizable in one generation
[1:48:17] i tell you again death is at the door of
[1:48:18] the evening like talent death
[1:48:20] is at the door
[1:48:24] i'm going to tell you the same way
[1:48:27] peter
[1:48:29] told sapphira
[1:48:31] said the same ones
[1:48:33] that carried your husband out
[1:48:35] are at the door right now to carry you
[1:48:37] out
[1:48:39] same one that took down that first stage
[1:48:41] if you open the door to him
[1:48:43] he's waiting to take you down
[1:48:45] he's waiting to carry you out these
[1:48:46] ain't games
[1:48:49] we can't let down the bar on anything
[1:48:51] listen there's a landmark of holiness in
[1:48:53] the scripture
[1:48:55] of how we're to act of how we're to
[1:48:56] dress how we're to keep our hair
[1:48:59] a landmark
[1:49:01] you've got to be willing to stand for it
[1:49:04] it doesn't matter how unpopular it is
[1:49:07] it doesn't matter how mad it makes
[1:49:08] people i can't help it the bible says a
[1:49:10] woman should have uncut hair a man
[1:49:12] should have cut hair i didn't make the
[1:49:13] landmark
[1:49:14] he did
[1:49:16] are you willing to stand and defend it
[1:49:18] defenders of the landmarks
[1:49:21] oh come on it's easy to oh i want to
[1:49:22] defend all these things that make us
[1:49:23] jump and shout
[1:49:25] what about the things that are difficult
[1:49:27] to tell other people about
[1:49:29] to witness about when you're asking the
[1:49:31] story well why
[1:49:33] because the bible says
[1:49:39] listen there's still to be a very stark
[1:49:41] difference and a definite line between
[1:49:43] the church and the world
[1:49:46] the world should be able to look at you
[1:49:49] not talk to you
[1:49:50] look at you and know there's a christian
[1:49:54] they don't fit in they're swimming
[1:49:56] against the stream they're going in the
[1:49:59] opposite direction
[1:50:00] there's something about them that stands
[1:50:02] out romans 12 2 and be not conformed to
[1:50:05] this world but be you transformed by the
[1:50:08] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[1:50:10] what is that good
[1:50:11] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:50:14] this literally means don't let the world
[1:50:16] mold you
[1:50:18] don't be like the world they should see
[1:50:20] a stark difference
[1:50:21] brother brown would crowd against it he
[1:50:23] says you men you young boys with some of
[1:50:25] these little painted up jezebels the
[1:50:26] same way you shouldn't do that shame on
[1:50:29] the pastors that fail to say that in
[1:50:30] their church
[1:50:32] we are called out separated different
[1:50:34] people sanctified to the lord in israel
[1:50:36] yes sir we know the landmarks there
[1:50:39] wrote right here a plain view of it but
[1:50:42] we're just tossed about
[1:50:46] he's pointing back to scriptural
[1:50:47] landmarks
[1:50:49] about hair about dress about women
[1:50:51] preachers and he's told if you don't
[1:50:52] stop doing that you're going to ruin
[1:50:53] your ministry
[1:50:55] and i love his response he says say
[1:50:57] you're going to ruin your ministry well
[1:50:58] any ministry that the gospel will ruin
[1:51:01] ought to be ruined
[1:51:03] god give us boldness to stand for what's
[1:51:05] truth and tell the truth about it it's a
[1:51:07] sin it's a disgrace
[1:51:10] it's still a sin it's still a disgrace
[1:51:12] and people got to be willing to stand
[1:51:13] for the truth
[1:51:17] started so innocent in that age
[1:51:19] but now the landmarks are moved the
[1:51:20] truths of god's words are now lost to
[1:51:22] creeds the dogmas of man and down
[1:51:24] through the ages the landmarks get moved
[1:51:26] further and further and further twill it
[1:51:29] to where it's unrecognizable
[1:51:31] it would seem a horrible situation
[1:51:34] but i will restore
[1:51:36] saith the lord
[1:51:37] he didn't just leave it be that seed had
[1:51:40] to go into the ground can't you see why
[1:51:42] we had to have a prophet come
[1:51:44] can't you see why there had to be a
[1:51:45] malachi 4 to turn our hearts back to the
[1:51:48] original faith we didn't know what the
[1:51:49] original faith was
[1:51:51] it was unrecognizable it had been lost
[1:51:53] somebody had to come they could tie up
[1:51:55] the loose ends and point back to
[1:51:57] pentecost and say that's where he wants
[1:51:59] you that's where we go that's where
[1:52:01] we're headed back to the original faith
[1:52:05] it had been so far removed it was
[1:52:07] unrecognizable
[1:52:09] but god moved in luther
[1:52:11] and a landmark of justification is
[1:52:12] restored
[1:52:13] and god moves in wesley and the landmark
[1:52:16] of sanctification is restored and then
[1:52:19] god moves in azusa street and the
[1:52:21] landmark of gifts in the body is
[1:52:23] restored
[1:52:26] then in 1947 an angel visits a prophet
[1:52:30] at the exact same time israel is
[1:52:31] becoming a nation
[1:52:33] these things are not coincidence
[1:52:35] spiritual israel physical israel
[1:52:41] loose hands are being tied up message is
[1:52:42] going forth landmarks are being restored
[1:52:45] until once again there's a people in the
[1:52:47] land restored back
[1:52:49] to the land of the word not the land of
[1:52:51] man's thinking not the land of the
[1:52:53] denomination or the land of a creed or
[1:52:55] the land of a dogma the land of god's
[1:52:57] word the godhead is put back in place
[1:53:01] baptism is put back in place
[1:53:02] predestination original sin church ages
[1:53:04] seven seals
[1:53:06] what was ours what belongs to us is
[1:53:07] properly placed
[1:53:09] what belongs to israel is properly
[1:53:11] placed worship and spirit and truth is
[1:53:13] properly placed the tribulation in the
[1:53:15] church is put where it's supposed to be
[1:53:17] the rapture and the bride is put where
[1:53:19] it's supposed to be and once again
[1:53:21] there's a people standing where the
[1:53:22] exact same first church stood
[1:53:25] and satan looks and he goes
[1:53:27] hold on boys
[1:53:29] i recognize this
[1:53:33] i've seen this before
[1:53:35] this ain't something to toy with
[1:53:38] and he begins to sing the same word that
[1:53:39] paul preached being preached again
[1:53:42] and he sings the same power that cast
[1:53:43] him out in the new testament casting him
[1:53:45] out again he sees the power of the word
[1:53:48] changing lies he sees the spirit moving
[1:53:51] he recognizes
[1:53:52] this is that
[1:53:54] he recognizes it more than most people
[1:53:56] can
[1:53:58] he says this is that original returned
[1:54:01] back again but i know how i got him last
[1:54:03] time
[1:54:05] and he begins to use some of the same
[1:54:07] tactics again formalism
[1:54:09] questioning the supernatural
[1:54:11] questioning the authority of the word
[1:54:14] calling everything a worked up emotion
[1:54:17] cold worship with no feeling and slowly
[1:54:20] that snake is squeezing again
[1:54:23] slowly that snake is squeezing again the
[1:54:26] cycle
[1:54:27] of revival and death has never
[1:54:31] failed
[1:54:33] until now
[1:54:36] until now
[1:54:37] because this seed isn't made isn't
[1:54:39] predestined to go down into the earth
[1:54:41] that's already happened but this wheat
[1:54:43] is going to be harvested this weed's
[1:54:44] going in the garner this weed's going in
[1:54:46] a rapture he took down every other one
[1:54:49] down through the ages down through the
[1:54:50] ages out through the ages but when he
[1:54:52] grabs a hold of this one just like when
[1:54:54] he stuck his stinger there and christ at
[1:54:56] calvary he got a hold of a million watt
[1:54:58] blind
[1:54:59] he got a shock he wasn't expecting and
[1:55:01] he comes to you with formalism and he
[1:55:03] thinks you're just gonna go with it and
[1:55:05] he comes to you with doubt and he thinks
[1:55:06] you're just gonna go with it but
[1:55:08] somebody stands up and says no sir
[1:55:10] not today i'm a defender of the landlord
[1:55:13] i'll have freedom i'll have the holy
[1:55:16] ghost i'll have a refill and if i need
[1:55:18] another one i'll have a refilling my
[1:55:20] kids can have it you can have it them
[1:55:22] that are far off can have it we are
[1:55:24] defenders
[1:55:26] hallelujah
[1:55:29] defenders of the landmarks
[1:55:32] that recycle has never failed until now
[1:55:35] because the bride recognizes it's a lie
[1:55:41] says i'm not going to let you steal it
[1:55:43] this is for my family
[1:55:47] this is for my church
[1:55:49] listen the elect
[1:55:50] can't be deceived
[1:55:54] she's going to recognize it she's going
[1:55:55] to return to the landmarks and she's
[1:55:57] going to defend the landmarks it's not
[1:55:59] just a return to return
[1:56:02] i
[1:56:03] i don't care if you run around this
[1:56:04] church so much that you run a marathon
[1:56:07] if you miss the rapture what was the
[1:56:08] point
[1:56:11] it's not just a return just to get the
[1:56:13] gifts that's not the point
[1:56:16] it's a return
[1:56:18] to rapture
[1:56:19] it's a return to the rapturing faith
[1:56:23] that church had it
[1:56:26] why didn't they rapture because they had
[1:56:28] to go into the ground
[1:56:30] so that it could produce a crop
[1:56:33] it had no choice it was predestined to
[1:56:36] that's one thing we don't necessarily
[1:56:37] like to say is we're predestined not to
[1:56:39] fall they had no choice but to go into
[1:56:41] the ground
[1:56:43] it was predestined to happen
[1:56:51] those landmarks were to remain
[1:56:52] undisturbed
[1:56:54] they were not to be encroached upon not
[1:56:55] only in that generation but throughout
[1:56:57] their generations to come
[1:56:59] and when god establishes a landmark it
[1:57:01] is to remain
[1:57:03] and yet as we said satan begins to use
[1:57:04] the same tactics and it's looking
[1:57:06] innocent and it's looking so small
[1:57:08] that's why we defend with such urgency
[1:57:11] that's why i cross the land we stand for
[1:57:13] all the word
[1:57:14] that's why we stand for the moving of
[1:57:16] the spirit for altar calls for prayer
[1:57:18] lines for gifts and operations because
[1:57:20] we can't give up even one piece of the
[1:57:23] land that we have returned to and you
[1:57:24] say aren't there other things that you
[1:57:26] should defend
[1:57:27] absolutely
[1:57:29] then why are you constantly focusing on
[1:57:31] that
[1:57:32] you know people want to say
[1:57:34] you know it's a minor
[1:57:35] not even going to get into that that's
[1:57:38] fine
[1:57:39] it's a minor
[1:57:41] but is it part of god's word
[1:57:44] then it is a landmark
[1:57:47] and my point is
[1:57:49] the reason we're always on that is that
[1:57:51] is where the attack
[1:57:53] has come
[1:57:55] do you understand
[1:57:57] that's where the attack is why are you
[1:57:59] constantly talking about the moving of
[1:58:00] the spirit why are you constantly we
[1:58:02] don't have that problem here okay that's
[1:58:04] fine
[1:58:05] but that is where the attack is
[1:58:08] that is where satan has aimed his darts
[1:58:10] that is where he has aimed his war
[1:58:11] machine that's where he's coming trying
[1:58:13] to bring formalism that is what people
[1:58:15] are slowly giving into and so therefore
[1:58:17] that is what we are crying out against
[1:58:23] that's where the attack has been and
[1:58:24] sometimes it's subtle sometimes not so
[1:58:26] subtle
[1:58:29] how long would it take
[1:58:32] how long would it take if we allowed
[1:58:33] these things to go unchecked and
[1:58:35] unchallenged before we would be
[1:58:36] unrecognizable just as ephesus was
[1:58:40] a lot quicker than what you'd think
[1:58:43] not a christian left that blows my mind
[1:58:47] how long would it take until the power
[1:58:48] of god would be just a story that used
[1:58:51] to happen at evening like tabernacle
[1:58:53] tweet was something that those people
[1:58:55] that used to go here once had
[1:58:59] before it was the faith that was once
[1:59:00] delivered
[1:59:02] how long does it take
[1:59:05] how long before the churches it used to
[1:59:07] be
[1:59:08] how long before a church full of power
[1:59:11] full of the power of god becomes a
[1:59:12] church with stories about the power of
[1:59:14] god
[1:59:18] you know what i believe i don't believe
[1:59:21] in bashing other churches i don't
[1:59:22] believe in bashing anybody this isn't
[1:59:24] the bash i'm just gonna give you some
[1:59:25] history okay
[1:59:27] i've always been one that believes that
[1:59:28] what you have is so great you can focus
[1:59:30] on what you have and not what others
[1:59:32] don't
[1:59:34] that's what i believe so this is just a
[1:59:35] little history okay
[1:59:37] bear with me
[1:59:38] life tabernacle of shreveport
[1:59:41] y'all all know about it if you listen to
[1:59:43] the message at all
[1:59:45] look what happened there
[1:59:48] look at the meetings that took place in
[1:59:50] shreveport
[1:59:51] i'll just name a few of the messages
[1:59:53] preached by malachi 4 in shreveport the
[1:59:56] token
[1:59:59] investments
[2:00:00] the countdown
[2:00:02] invisible union
[2:00:04] on the wings of a snow white dove
[2:00:07] i could go on and on
[2:00:09] and on
[2:00:11] and they sit there
[2:00:13] dead
[2:00:18] william branham a name not even hardly
[2:00:20] known by anybody in the congregation
[2:00:23] whispered maybe about how he got off
[2:00:26] i found on their websites the other day
[2:00:28] it was very interesting i loved it
[2:00:29] actually where they were all posting
[2:00:31] pictures of things that have happened in
[2:00:32] that congregation since like the 40s
[2:00:35] you'd be shocked at how many pictures of
[2:00:37] brother branham are in there
[2:00:42] and people asking who's that
[2:00:45] who's the guy on the left
[2:00:47] what
[2:00:50] one generation
[2:00:53] who's the who's the shorter guy
[2:00:55] next to brother jack moore there
[2:00:57] what
[2:00:58] are you serious
[2:01:00] yeah
[2:01:03] very serious
[2:01:04] it doesn't take
[2:01:06] long doesn't take long at all until
[2:01:09] people are like did did god used to move
[2:01:11] in that place
[2:01:13] was god part of that family it seems
[2:01:14] like i remember they were believers
[2:01:17] seems like i remember they used to go to
[2:01:19] church
[2:01:21] i think the power of god used to move
[2:01:23] there
[2:01:24] yeah i've heard that
[2:01:26] seems like they used to have some good
[2:01:27] services
[2:01:28] the first stage lasted 120 years gone
[2:01:31] not one christian left
[2:01:33] but it came in so unassuming
[2:01:35] so innocent
[2:01:37] why do you constantly cry out because
[2:01:39] that spirit would have you dead and
[2:01:41] unrecognizable in a matter of years
[2:01:45] it's worth crying out about
[2:01:47] it's worth standing on that landmark and
[2:01:49] crying out against it
[2:01:51] the spirit that wants to make you cold
[2:01:53] and formal
[2:01:55] comes in so subtle
[2:01:57] it wants to move the landmark of worship
[2:01:59] move the landmark of gifts move the
[2:02:01] landmark of an acts 2 experience move
[2:02:03] the landmark of holiness
[2:02:05] tells you just accept the message
[2:02:07] sing a few songs don't get too excited
[2:02:10] you've seen the word
[2:02:12] you're good
[2:02:15] for a tribulation
[2:02:21] don't get too excited doesn't really
[2:02:23] matter about the length of your skirts
[2:02:24] and how tight your shirts are it's okay
[2:02:26] here
[2:02:29] listen
[2:02:31] we got to quit worrying about what's
[2:02:33] going on in denominations and another
[2:02:35] this ain't a them problem i'm talking to
[2:02:36] you
[2:02:38] this is us problem
[2:02:40] this ain't about where they didn't do or
[2:02:43] what they didn't do god bless them for
[2:02:45] what they do
[2:02:47] that's why i'm matt this is us
[2:02:51] this is us at kadish
[2:02:54] in other words when they were at cades
[2:02:56] the dispute wasn't with egypt anymore
[2:02:57] brother joe
[2:02:58] pharaoh wasn't keeping them from going
[2:03:00] into the promised land
[2:03:03] it was them
[2:03:06] it was their unbelief
[2:03:08] it was their doubts
[2:03:11] the problem was in their camp
[2:03:15] and the thing is those that actually
[2:03:17] believed all the word and wanted to take
[2:03:19] the promises made the other ones really
[2:03:20] mad at them
[2:03:23] made them very mad at them
[2:03:26] and the thing is
[2:03:28] they would they would never say it
[2:03:30] out loud or even recognize i don't
[2:03:32] believe that there's many today in our
[2:03:35] ranks that want to go back
[2:03:38] i didn't expect many amens there that's
[2:03:41] okay and when i say our ranks i mean the
[2:03:43] ranks of the message
[2:03:48] it's okay
[2:03:51] they want to go back
[2:03:53] just like the congregation of egypt
[2:03:55] israel longed for egypt many today
[2:03:58] belong to a return of a denominational
[2:04:01] life a place with no victory a place
[2:04:04] where lukewarm is accepted a place where
[2:04:06] they can live how they want what they
[2:04:07] want put what they want on their face
[2:04:10] where they can marry and remarry where
[2:04:12] church attendance isn't blasted
[2:04:15] where their sins will be tolerated
[2:04:22] numbers 14 3
[2:04:23] and wherefore hath the lord brought us
[2:04:25] unto this land so to fall by the sword
[2:04:27] that our wives and our children should
[2:04:29] be a prey were it not better for us to
[2:04:32] return into egypt
[2:04:35] and they said one to another let us make
[2:04:36] a captain and let us return
[2:04:39] to egypt
[2:04:41] and they'll find him a preacher to do it
[2:04:43] for him
[2:04:46] sure
[2:04:47] and they might not ever go back
[2:04:50] in name they'll start their own little
[2:04:51] message church
[2:04:54] oh yeah it'll be a message church and
[2:04:55] they'll and they'll find a preacher
[2:04:56] that'll preach half the word but he
[2:04:58] won't preach on holiness
[2:05:01] he'll quote a few
[2:05:04] messages and and say brother branham's
[2:05:05] name and preach on jesus but he ain't
[2:05:07] going to preach about a real conversion
[2:05:09] at the altar
[2:05:11] about changing your life
[2:05:13] about the full word he'll pick and
[2:05:14] choose
[2:05:16] he'll pick half the word here and have a
[2:05:18] denominational life then moses and aaron
[2:05:21] fell on their faces before all the
[2:05:22] assembly of the congregation of the
[2:05:24] children of israel
[2:05:25] and joshua the son of nun and caleb the
[2:05:27] son of jefuna which were of them that
[2:05:30] searched the land rent their clothes
[2:05:31] this kind of attitude makes the real
[2:05:34] believer go into prayer
[2:05:36] it makes them go into a place of
[2:05:38] desperation and say we can't accept that
[2:05:40] we can't accept that cold formal
[2:05:42] religion we can't accept going back to a
[2:05:44] denominational life we can't accept
[2:05:46] going back and they become desperate and
[2:05:49] they begin to cry out if the lord
[2:05:51] delight in us shall he bring us into
[2:05:53] this land and give it us a land which
[2:05:55] floweth with milk and honey only rebel
[2:05:58] not ye against the lord neither fear ye
[2:06:00] the people of the land for they are bred
[2:06:02] for us their defense is departed from
[2:06:04] them and the lord is with us fear them
[2:06:06] not
[2:06:07] and the congregation made stone them
[2:06:10] with stones
[2:06:12] and the glory of the lord appeared in
[2:06:13] the tabernacle of the congregation
[2:06:15] before all the children of israel
[2:06:16] listen there's people that don't want to
[2:06:18] take the land
[2:06:22] they don't want the holy ghost
[2:06:25] and it crept in so slow
[2:06:27] that they don't even recognize and they
[2:06:29] look just like any other church
[2:06:35] listen it is a landmark you must be born
[2:06:39] again
[2:06:40] that's just how it is
[2:06:42] it's a landmark you must receive the
[2:06:44] baptism of the holy ghost you must
[2:06:47] repent of your own ideas of your own
[2:06:50] thoughts we didn't make the landmarks
[2:06:52] but we are to defend them
[2:06:55] he says but today our men and women are
[2:06:56] getting away from that they're getting
[2:06:58] away from the old-fashioned landmarks we
[2:07:00] used to go by you ought to get back to
[2:07:02] that old pentecostal landmark what you
[2:07:04] need here in this valley is an
[2:07:06] old-fashioned god sense sky blue sin
[2:07:08] killing religion the power of the gospel
[2:07:11] back in the churches again back through
[2:07:13] the blood of the lord jesus into the
[2:07:15] fellowship by relationship by being born
[2:07:17] of the holy spirit entering into the
[2:07:19] pentecostal chicana amen i'm not beside
[2:07:22] myself i know where i'm at oh but
[2:07:25] brother sister to get caught away into
[2:07:27] that shekinah glory where it's just you
[2:07:29] and god alone are standing
[2:07:31] fellowshipping that's the only approach
[2:07:34] i know of
[2:07:42] ever since israel was returned to the
[2:07:44] land and officially they officially
[2:07:46] became a nation 1948
[2:07:48] because there were different proposals
[2:07:50] and things rejected in 1947 by the u.n
[2:07:52] council but they're officially a nation
[2:07:54] 1948
[2:07:56] but ever since they've returned they've
[2:07:58] had to fight for their very existence
[2:08:02] they've had to defend their borders and
[2:08:03] their landmarks
[2:08:05] at all costs because they understand
[2:08:07] that the enemy even putting a foot on
[2:08:09] their land is cause for concern not only
[2:08:11] concerned but to go on the offensive and
[2:08:13] go on the attack they can't give up
[2:08:14] anything
[2:08:15] they can't give up anything
[2:08:18] they can't blow an encroachment of the
[2:08:20] enemy into their property is no big deal
[2:08:22] because israel knows what it's like to
[2:08:24] be destroyed
[2:08:26] israel knows what it's like to lose the
[2:08:28] land
[2:08:29] they know what the enemy wants to do
[2:08:33] holocaust
[2:08:35] they understand this ain't just about
[2:08:36] taking your joy
[2:08:39] they understand this ain't about you
[2:08:40] just living a little blow your
[2:08:41] privileges he wants to wipe you off the
[2:08:43] face of the earth
[2:08:44] israel understands that
[2:08:46] and the enemy for years now has been
[2:08:48] attacking
[2:08:50] and destroying jews jewish cultural
[2:08:53] sites now there's some things here i
[2:08:54] want you to catch hold of look at it in
[2:08:55] a spiritual sense
[2:08:59] been attacking and destroying jewish
[2:09:01] landmarks
[2:09:04] now that would seem like no big deal
[2:09:06] it's just a historical site there are no
[2:09:08] human casualties
[2:09:10] they're not even attacking humans
[2:09:12] they're attacking ancient landmarks
[2:09:16] cultural historical sites but what isis
[2:09:19] and groups
[2:09:21] like the palestinian coalitions have
[2:09:23] learned
[2:09:24] is that these landmarks give legitimacy
[2:09:27] to the jewish culture
[2:09:29] and the jewish claim that the land is
[2:09:31] theirs
[2:09:33] that landmark gives a legitimate claim
[2:09:36] that the jews can say no
[2:09:38] this was ours
[2:09:40] this belonged to us before it belonged
[2:09:42] to you we were here
[2:09:44] first
[2:09:45] it gives them acclaim
[2:09:47] to the land
[2:09:49] it says it gives the legitimacy to their
[2:09:52] very right to exist
[2:09:55] in that region
[2:09:56] let me read a few of this few of these
[2:09:58] because the enemy claims that the land
[2:10:00] doesn't belong to them
[2:10:02] and never was theirs
[2:10:04] but the landmarks prove otherwise
[2:10:07] isis justifies the destruction of
[2:10:09] cultural heritage sites by salafism i
[2:10:12] don't know what that means
[2:10:14] which according to its followers places
[2:10:17] great importance on establishing tawid
[2:10:21] which means monotheism
[2:10:23] thus there is an ideological
[2:10:25] underpinning to their destruction of
[2:10:27] historical and cultural heritage which
[2:10:30] is
[2:10:30] trying to destroy the destroy the
[2:10:32] cultural heritage of the region in an
[2:10:34] attempt to wipe the slate clean
[2:10:37] and rewrite history in their own image
[2:10:42] therefore jewish communities are
[2:10:44] destroyed and lose the material remains
[2:10:46] of their culture as a testimony to their
[2:10:50] very existence
[2:10:54] you could walk in life tabernacle right
[2:10:56] now and most of them would not know that
[2:10:58] stuff took place
[2:11:01] wiped clean
[2:11:03] you go to ephesus
[2:11:05] not a christian left
[2:11:07] wipe clean
[2:11:09] he's trying to take your landmarks
[2:11:11] because those landmarks give you a right
[2:11:13] to exist
[2:11:15] those landmark landmarks give legitimacy
[2:11:18] to why you're in the land they prove
[2:11:20] that the land belongs to you
[2:11:24] says if anyone still has doubts about
[2:11:26] the palestinian authority's
[2:11:27] determination to erase all traces of
[2:11:30] israel's ancient jewish heritage
[2:11:32] simply put hundreds of cherished jewish
[2:11:34] sites in the land of israel which have
[2:11:36] survived the romans the byzantines the
[2:11:39] arabs the crusaders
[2:11:41] mama luke and the ottoman occupation are
[2:11:44] now being systematically destroyed right
[2:11:45] under our noses by the palestinians
[2:11:51] says the report which has not received
[2:11:52] widespread attention
[2:11:54] says that 289 sites which represent a
[2:11:57] whopping 80 percent of those surveyed
[2:11:59] have been damaged and destroyed these
[2:12:01] include sites dating back to the
[2:12:03] biblical times as well as those from the
[2:12:04] second temple herodian and the hasmonean
[2:12:07] periods
[2:12:08] listen there can be no doubt what satan
[2:12:10] wants
[2:12:11] you can't be half-hearted about this
[2:12:13] word
[2:12:14] you can't be half-hearted about
[2:12:16] defending what belongs to you
[2:12:18] you can't be half-hearted about any of
[2:12:20] it any part because it's our inheritance
[2:12:22] it proves who we are it shows that we're
[2:12:24] in the land but he wants a repeat of the
[2:12:26] first age aimed at but
[2:12:29] relaxed
[2:12:31] says the palestinian authority recently
[2:12:33] seized control of teleroma and brought
[2:12:36] in heavy engineering equipment and paved
[2:12:38] a road right over parts of the ruins
[2:12:41] thereby causing inestimable damage
[2:12:44] adding insult to injury they then had
[2:12:46] the gall to hold a formal ceremony and
[2:12:48] declare the palace which was built by
[2:12:50] the descendants of the maccabees to be a
[2:12:52] palestinian heritage site
[2:12:55] not only
[2:12:56] is it not yours he says
[2:12:58] it's mine
[2:13:01] adam lost
[2:13:02] the position
[2:13:04] i took it
[2:13:06] man fell
[2:13:08] i took it
[2:13:10] not only can you not have it
[2:13:12] but it's mine
[2:13:14] satan i'd like to remind you
[2:13:17] adam did fall i'll agree with you there
[2:13:19] but there was a kinsmen redeemer
[2:13:21] that came on calvary and brother branham
[2:13:24] said that day on calvary he stripped
[2:13:25] satan of every right he ever had and
[2:13:27] returned all the blessings right back
[2:13:29] into the hands of man and i'm gonna
[2:13:31] stand and fight for them you can say
[2:13:33] it's yours all you want but there are
[2:13:34] landmarks that prove this land is mine
[2:13:36] i've defended them i've stood on them
[2:13:38] i'm still standing on them this land is
[2:13:40] mine this land is yours you can have all
[2:13:42] of it but you got to fight for it you
[2:13:44] got to recognize what he's doing you got
[2:13:46] to stand and say not today satan you
[2:13:49] won't take this land you won't take this
[2:13:51] ground you can't have it i am a defender
[2:13:55] of the landmarks
[2:13:57] hallelujah
[2:13:59] a defender
[2:14:02] of
[2:14:03] the landmarks
[2:14:09] it's an attack
[2:14:11] on the landmarks and israel has to fight
[2:14:13] every day and their motto is
[2:14:16] never again
[2:14:18] never again
[2:14:20] never again will they be driven from
[2:14:21] their homeland
[2:14:22] never again will they give up what god
[2:14:24] has given them they have taken a stand
[2:14:27] and so must we
[2:14:33] 120 years of the first age
[2:14:36] not a christian left in ephesus
[2:14:39] how short a time it takes for something
[2:14:40] to be lost
[2:14:43] it's only a memory
[2:14:45] of what happened there
[2:14:46] he doesn't just want your worship church
[2:14:49] he doesn't just want the gifts he wants
[2:14:51] you to give up a
[2:14:52] landmark he wants a way in so that in a
[2:14:55] short time there'll be no remembrance of
[2:14:58] what you were
[2:15:00] what was yours
[2:15:02] what god did
[2:15:03] how god moved
[2:15:06] tell a little story a history story i
[2:15:09] know some of you are shocked
[2:15:13] there was a greek by the name of
[2:15:15] xenophon
[2:15:16] history considers him a great man he was
[2:15:18] a philosopher he was a general he was an
[2:15:21] author
[2:15:22] educated under socrates so he's one of
[2:15:24] those guys that in that realm they
[2:15:26] really look up to
[2:15:27] he lived a very interesting life he was
[2:15:29] a mercenary
[2:15:31] and
[2:15:32] he was part of ten thousand mercenaries
[2:15:35] that were hired by cyrus the younger
[2:15:38] to overthrow
[2:15:40] his older brother artaxerxes ii
[2:15:43] in in the kingdom of persia
[2:15:47] long story short things didn't go good
[2:15:50] all the leaders got killed there was
[2:15:51] some rebellion they thought they were
[2:15:53] surrendering everybody gets slaughtered
[2:15:55] and the remain not everybody the leaders
[2:15:58] most of these 10 000 are still alive
[2:16:00] and they vote
[2:16:03] they vote to have new leaders and
[2:16:04] xenophon becomes voted the general so
[2:16:07] here he is in the middle of persia and
[2:16:09] his goal is get his home alive back to
[2:16:11] greece if i didn't make that clear
[2:16:14] and so on his journeys he writes all
[2:16:16] about it and he details it
[2:16:19] because he was a great writer and so
[2:16:20] there's a lot of details that he puts in
[2:16:23] there
[2:16:24] and it's known as the persian expedition
[2:16:26] and i'm sorry if this bores you it
[2:16:28] absolutely astounded me
[2:16:31] and xenophon talks about traveling
[2:16:33] through what is now modern-day iraq
[2:16:36] and they had no food they had no
[2:16:37] supplies they could only live off what
[2:16:39] they were able to win through force or
[2:16:42] uh diplomacy
[2:16:44] and they're pushing through and they end
[2:16:45] up coming to this place
[2:16:48] in his own words says we marched one
[2:16:50] stage six parasangs to a great
[2:16:53] stronghold
[2:16:54] deserted and lying in ruins
[2:16:57] the foundation of its wall was made of
[2:17:00] polished stone full of shells and it was
[2:17:03] 50 feet in breadth and 50 feet in height
[2:17:07] upon this foundation
[2:17:09] was a wall of brick so it's already 50
[2:17:12] foot
[2:17:13] then upon this foundation is a wall of
[2:17:15] brick
[2:17:16] 50 feet thick and 100 feet in height
[2:17:20] and the circuit of the wall was six
[2:17:22] parasangs
[2:17:24] or 21 miles
[2:17:27] this is a city with 150 foot walls
[2:17:30] 50 foot thick
[2:17:32] and 21 miles around
[2:17:36] and it's deserted
[2:17:39] and his writings would detail how he
[2:17:41] went around trying to figure out
[2:17:43] where am i
[2:17:44] what is this
[2:17:46] no one knows
[2:17:49] no one even knows who built it
[2:17:52] no one even knows who inhabited it
[2:17:57] its history
[2:17:59] its culture
[2:18:01] the things it stood for
[2:18:02] the things it fought for
[2:18:05] gone
[2:18:07] to the point that there's nothing he
[2:18:10] gives he makes up a name he literally is
[2:18:12] just like we're going to call it this
[2:18:16] to prove that his writings were true the
[2:18:18] general that was chasing him also
[2:18:19] details this city because he's camped on
[2:18:21] the other side
[2:18:24] you know what it was
[2:18:27] it was the
[2:18:28] assyrian capital
[2:18:30] of nineveh
[2:18:33] and when god says something's gonna fall
[2:18:35] it falls buddy
[2:18:40] nineveh
[2:18:41] the center of the great assyrian empire
[2:18:45] one of the greatest empires this world
[2:18:47] has ever known
[2:18:49] but when the babylonians and the medes
[2:18:51] came in and destroyed it
[2:18:53] they didn't just want to conquer it
[2:18:56] they had been treated very poorly by the
[2:18:58] assyrians and so they wiped out
[2:19:01] everything
[2:19:02] they wiped out everybody
[2:19:05] they wiped out every record
[2:19:08] to where here they are and the
[2:19:10] astounding part about this
[2:19:12] was this is only 200 years from when it
[2:19:15] fell
[2:19:15] we're not talking about a city thousands
[2:19:17] of years old
[2:19:19] it was 200 years it would be like 200
[2:19:22] years from now somebody walking into new
[2:19:23] york city and going
[2:19:26] who built this
[2:19:29] what happened here
[2:19:32] he would describe this place as
[2:19:33] something much greater than anything
[2:19:36] they could ever build in greece
[2:19:40] what happened
[2:19:43] i gave a little ground here
[2:19:45] the enemy took a little ground there
[2:19:48] soon the enemy pushed through and got
[2:19:50] this landmark
[2:19:52] and then the enemy pushed through and
[2:19:54] got that landmark
[2:19:57] and pretty soon their intent wasn't just
[2:19:59] to take a few landmarks
[2:20:03] their intent
[2:20:04] was to wipe them out
[2:20:07] their intent
[2:20:09] was to totally destroy them how quick
[2:20:13] and he attacks the landmarks and he
[2:20:15] attacks the places where god move
[2:20:18] and then he says was it ever really
[2:20:19] yours
[2:20:22] did those things ever really happen
[2:20:29] but i know it happened
[2:20:32] because this message ripped the seals
[2:20:34] open

[2:22:22] somebody's gonna overcome
[2:22:25] somebody's gonna
[2:22:27] take a rapture
[2:22:32] brother brown says
[2:22:41] if i can find it
[2:22:42] and we're done
[2:22:46] so we noticed that jehoshaphat
[2:22:48] had seen the results from that kind of a
[2:22:50] life
[2:22:51] he'd seen the results from his father
[2:22:53] when he served the lord
[2:22:54] then when he didn't serve the lord
[2:22:57] so all of that together and taking it
[2:22:58] under consideration jehoshaphat purpose
[2:23:00] in his heart to serve the lord and to
[2:23:02] cling to the things that his father
[2:23:04] david did at the beginning
[2:23:07] i like that at the beginning
[2:23:09] the bible said in other words he went
[2:23:11] back to the old landmark
[2:23:13] and then they cleaned out the rose it
[2:23:14] would be good for us pentecost to go
[2:23:17] back to the old landmark
[2:23:19] it would be good for us to go back to
[2:23:20] the old landmarks and clean out the
[2:23:22] roads
[2:23:23] what would happen today
[2:23:24] i suppose mostly of you pentecostal
[2:23:26] people here this afternoon what would
[2:23:28] happen if actually the church went back
[2:23:29] to the old landmark you talk about a
[2:23:31] cleaning up
[2:23:32] there'd really be one around the
[2:23:34] pentecostal church it sure would how
[2:23:36] many knows that's the truth why sure it
[2:23:38] is there'd certainly be a reformation
[2:23:40] going on how people would be acting
[2:23:42] different dressing different talking
[2:23:44] different oh it it just be all together
[2:23:47] a different church if we went back to
[2:23:48] the old landmark where we started from
[2:23:51] now so then god blessed him god will
[2:23:53] bless anyone who'll go back to the old
[2:23:55] landmark of the bible and start from the
[2:23:57] bible not according to theology
[2:23:59] some man-made theology but from true
[2:24:00] bible theology and start at the old
[2:24:02] landmark and move up god will move with
[2:24:05] you so god began to bless jehoshaphat
[2:24:07] and the first thing you know he began to
[2:24:08] prosper him and he built up garrisons so
[2:24:11] that these uncircumcised could not come
[2:24:14] in
[2:24:14] and that's what the church needs today
[2:24:16] is a garrison of the old time asked of
[2:24:19] apostolic teaching so this lukewarm
[2:24:21] formal in and out up and down doesn't
[2:24:24] get into our church
[2:24:25] what did i say that's right though
[2:24:27] that's right we've permitted too many
[2:24:29] things to creep in brethren too many
[2:24:31] things that we left the old landmark and
[2:24:33] we're letting things begin to creep in
[2:24:35] he said we never garrisoned the church
[2:24:38] and now we've got everything in it
[2:24:39] that's right all the isms and hisms and
[2:24:42] everything else in the church because we
[2:24:43] never garrisoned the word
[2:24:46] what's he saying surround it
[2:24:48] surround it
[2:24:49] defend it
[2:24:50] protect it garrison the landmarks
[2:24:53] garrison the word
[2:24:55] back to the landmarks today evening like
[2:24:56] tabernacle
[2:24:58] back to the holy ghost
[2:25:00] back to landmarks in your life back to
[2:25:02] the landmarks in your home
[2:25:04] back to landmarks and your children
[2:25:06] back to applying the token
[2:25:08] back to a prayer life
[2:25:10] back to prayer meetings back to an upper
[2:25:12] room experience
[2:25:14] back to your first love
[2:25:17] back to the word
[2:25:20] he says god help us to have that type of
[2:25:21] a credential today and let's contend for
[2:25:24] the faith
[2:25:25] the true faith that was once delivered
[2:25:27] to the saints the saints believed in the
[2:25:30] death burial and resurrection they
[2:25:32] believed in the baptism of the holy
[2:25:33] spirit the early church believed it do
[2:25:36] you believe it he said then let's
[2:25:39] contend for it
[2:25:40] god bless you church
[2:25:42] contend for it
