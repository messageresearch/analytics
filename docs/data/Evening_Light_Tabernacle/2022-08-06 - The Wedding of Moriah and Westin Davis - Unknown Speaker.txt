to be so present at this place today and permeate this service lord with your presence lord may we today be conscious of the solemn ceremony that we have entered into and regarded with respect and honor and pledged to keep this until that day you call us home we thank you lord for this young couple that is standing here before me today we believe lord that this is a predestined moment lord that they have stepped out of eternity into time and one day we'll go back into eternity we believe lord also if that love is true that it is an eternal love and that one day in the eternities hand in hand together they will enjoy the blessings of almighty god in the great realms beyond we asked lord that you would bless us now each one lord those that have assembled today i ask that you would give a special blessing upon them the bride and the groom and the family and the two families that are being united together by this ceremony i pray father your blessings now would abide in this place and over this marriage and in the days to come in jesus name amen well today we have what i believe is a wedding of royalty the world may not recognize it as such but this wedding today brings together two families and their families of royalty we've stepped out of eternity into a space of time because we were preplanned from the foundation of the world and our names were written on the lamb's book of life and today one of the photos of the lamb's book of life is standing right before us right now and heaven is given witness angels are present watching a scene unfold that was only known by god but expressed now at this moment eternity and time is now blended together in celebration of this momentous occasion this is more than just a beautiful moment in time as it was for ordained before the foundation of the world and not only do we have this great assembled host of friends and family who we so appreciate you being here to support this young couple today but the host of heaven itself has drawn near to witness this event for the attributes of god are on display and this wedding itself is reflecting the glory to come when god will take to himself a bride without spot or wrinkle and as the pruitt and the davis families unite together today we pray a special blessing upon them in this moment in this time for this union as we said was ordained by god and one that god has built it was pre-planned we can't remember standing in eternity because it was still just a thought in god's mind but now we are standing in time doing what god foresaw and for plan long ago in the eternal ages time has its ups and downs it comes with both joys great joys and sometimes with deep sorrows but god in his wisdom knew that man should not be alone and he has destined for this part of life's journey for you two to walk together hand in hand here in time as you head toward eternity and although you may never proclaim the word of god from the pulpit and of course that would be a great honor if you did but nevertheless you are both ordained to carry out his word as as the bride to christ and as a husband who imitates christ in all things even so the woman is to imitate the bride of christ and so god has so designed it where you will not do this alone but together in one flesh and today is a reflection of what god did in the garden of eden as the scripture once again becomes god breathed to be fulfilled now in you and in the garden god created man in his own image from spirit form to flesh form but god did not want man to be alone and i believe this is the heart of god for he too wants a bride in his image so that together they will reign as king and queen and the eternal ages to come when god looked upon adam he sighed man is alone and it's not good so he performed an operation and he reached the way down and to man's side and he brought out a portion of man's own flesh what a wedding that was think of that under the canopy of the garden of eden and just as we saw weston in your eyes as they lit up as she walked down the aisle and all of a sudden these hundreds of guests just faded away and all you could see now was her for suddenly in that moment the most important one in the room had stepped forth may that never leave your life for your eyes must always remain single upon her forsaking all others and clinging only to her and mariah your eyes must always remain single upon your husband so that you behold no other but him you see weston the man is never complete until he's married and after that he's finished so this union you're making is something that god desires to do himself because he's not complete without us and god had placed that in adam to be lonely because he too desired a wife and while the prophets foretold this and isaac and rebecca portrayed it and we read biblical accounts of the love of a man and a woman of jacob's love for rachel of mary pledged to joseph of the shulamite and her beloved and none of that could fully express god's great desire though so jesus left the ivory palaces and his golden streets and all of heaven's glory to take upon himself the form of man and reflect his pleasure in weddings the first miracle he performed would be at a wedding where water was turned into wine he did this by the power of creation and with this power he is right here today to take two people and turn two people into one the bible tells us that god is love and that love comes from god from the beginning to the end the bible is a love story there we read of god's love to his people the love that sent christ to the cross of the redeeming love for the sinner and the abiding love for the redeemed you see god is the author of your love and that love is not to be temporary do not treat it as temporary never take one day for granted life is too short make christ a part of your marriage he wants to be the unseen guest in your home he wants to be in every conversation he is always neared in good times and bad times and difficulties and financial troubles and choices of life and great decisions that will have to be made he's always there make sure you don't go one day without spending time together with each other but more importantly with him weston i believe that you are a real man i believe you're a prince a child of the most high god your family your pastor your church family have done an incredible job of raising you and preparing you for this day and i i believe young men like you are a description of what this message is what is the message you're it you're the description of all the incredible sermons that are about and you're a great compliment to your great grandfather's ministry and all the other wonderful sermons that your pastor and other men of god have poured out into you there's a lot of heritage right here and i believe from the banisters of heaven there are those looking over and witnessing two joining in with us at this moment moriah supernatural gifts came through your family you have a great heritage there is there is a handing down from one generation to another the seeds of greatness that was in your forefathers or in you and god has done an incredible miracle in your life so that your name is known around the world but join together now your life will have more depth you will have greater understanding and god has set you apart from others to be a shining example to the world of god's grace and his goodness god is the author of love it is him that brings us together it is his love that will carry us through love conquers all it conquers every demon it conquers every power it is the greatest force on the face of the earth so let nothing come between you if it does recognize it would be the spirit of the enemy all there's surely be times of disagreements but every argument or ever disagreement can always be settled on your knees and remember this powerful word and put it to use forgive love is based on forgiveness hold no grudges let go and just love for love is of god western will you have this woman to live together in holy covenant of marriage will you love her honor her and comfort and keep her in sickness and in health and forsaking all others be faithful to her as long as you both shall live mariah will you have this man to live together in the holy covenant of marriage will you love him honor him comfort and keep him in sickness and in health and forsaken all others be faithful to him as long as you both shall live see marriage was instituted by god is not simply an idea of man marriage is a gift of god it's given to comfort the sorrows of life and to celebrate its joys marriage is the clasping of hands the blending of hearts the uniting of two lives as one your marriage must stand it doesn't it won't stand just necessarily by the authority of the state nor by the seal of your wedding certificate but rather it must stand on the strength of your love it must stand in the devotion of your love to one another in the good times and the bad and finally it must stand because of the participation of god in your relationship see marriage is meant to be the greatest human relationship that you will ever experience however in order for marriage to reach its full potential you must allow god to play a primary part and role in your relationship he knows your thoughts he knows your needs he understands your hearts and your love for each other in fact it was god that created the love and the excitement that you're experiencing this very moment the ideal marriage is like an eternal triangle with each of you at the bottom of the triangle and god at the top in that triangle the closer you get to god the closer you become to one another certainly you want your new life to be perfect you have visions of an eternity of joy but let me caution you it won't always be that way all the time unfortunately sorrow and heartache can find their ways into every life however if that eternal triangle remains unbroken no problem will ever be too great weston love moriah as your wife with all your being jesus just as christ loved the church and your wants and your needs will always be met likewise mariah if you respect and love and honor and western as your husband he will love and care for you all the days of your life and finally let me say to both of you remember the eternal triangle keep your spiritual eyes and ears open to god who is the source of love and fulfillment will be yours i promise you he will lead you into capacities that you never dreamed you possessed
