[34:04] father we ask these things in Jesus name
[34:07] amen amen amen if you have your
[34:12] Bibles with you and you would turn with
[34:15] me to the Book of Revelation chapter
[34:24] 3 tonight we're gonna take a look into
[34:27] our Church age study and go through some
[34:30] of the um sardan Church Age and and this
[34:34] will actually be part two of that study
[34:36] we did part one with the young people so
[34:38] some of this as we go we don't have
[34:41] anything on the
[34:43] screen uh some of this
[34:46] there as we go might seem like we're
[34:49] moving pretty quick to some of you uh
[34:52] but to those that were here it'll seem
[34:53] like a review so at the beginning we're
[34:55] GNA we're going to move quickly through
[34:58] this we're looking Revelation three and
[35:00] we're going to read down through verse 6
[35:04] says and unto the angel of the church in
[35:06] sord is right these things saith he that
[35:09] hath the seven spirits of God the Seven
[35:11] Stars I Know Thy works that thou Hast a
[35:14] name that thou livest and art dead Be
[35:17] watchful and strengthen the things which
[35:19] remain that are ready to die for I have
[35:22] not found thy works perfect before God
[35:26] remember therefore how thou Hast
[35:28] received and heard and hold fast and
[35:31] repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch
[35:35] I will come on thee as a thief and thou
[35:37] shalt not know what hour I will come
[35:40] upon thee thou Hast a few names even in
[35:43] Sardis which have not defiled their
[35:46] garments and they shall walk with me in
[35:49] white for they are worthy he that
[35:52] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[35:55] white rment and I will not blot out his
[35:58] name out of the book of life but I will
[36:01] confess his name before my father and
[36:03] before his angels he that hath an ear
[36:06] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[36:09] the churches amen I pray that the Lord
[36:11] add His blessings as you take your
[36:14] seat as they're working on these
[36:17] technical issues I do know that there is
[36:21] a setting that they have to change every
[36:22] time because this is Powerpoint and they
[36:24] have to switch that every time so if we
[36:27] can get that so we're looking at the
[36:29] sardan church
[36:31] age and um hopefully we'll have visuals
[36:34] here soon it's it's from the time of
[36:37] 1520 through the year 1750 it is the
[36:40] fifth age and Sardis was an ancient city
[36:44] that was the capital of Lydia and in the
[36:47] days of of Emperor tiberious it was
[36:50] desolated by earthquakes and plagues the
[36:53] Roman and Greek historians of the time
[36:55] period said it was the greatest Earth
[36:57] quake in human history it struck in in
[37:01] ad. 17 and and if you think about it
[37:04] when you see these historical events
[37:05] that you and you can place them in
[37:07] biblical times this was in ad17 so this
[37:10] event would have taken place during the
[37:13] life of Jesus Christ while he was here
[37:15] on Earth and and as a matter of fact it
[37:17] was Tiberius who was the Roman Emperor
[37:20] at the time of Jesus's crucifixion and
[37:23] so this major earthquake struck and
[37:26] destroyed many of the city ities there
[37:27] in Asia Minor and and Sardis actually
[37:30] never would recover from this and and as
[37:33] we look at this you know we we look at
[37:35] the the way the Holy Spirit worked I is
[37:38] he would take a city and and he would
[37:40] see the the the attributes of that City
[37:43] and and he would call it out and place
[37:45] it in the Scripture A as a to represent
[37:48] a period of time or a church Age and and
[37:52] and as we look at this in Sardis Sardis
[37:55] was carrying on the mother and Son
[37:58] worship that that had carried over from
[38:00] Babylonian times with the worship of
[38:03] cbel and her son
[38:05] diois and she was known as the Queen of
[38:08] Heaven and her son was known as the Lord
[38:10] of Heaven she was the revealer of mercy
[38:13] and he the revealer of Truth they held
[38:16] the keys together to the afterlife and
[38:20] as we've gone through this study each
[38:21] time we we've pointed out and focused on
[38:23] the origins of the mother and son
[38:26] worship down through history and the
[38:29] reason that we've done this is to make
[38:30] it clear where the traditions of
[38:33] Catholicism come from all right these
[38:35] these come These Are pagan Traditions
[38:37] they're not based in the Bible at all uh
[38:40] but they're Pagan traditions and Pagan
[38:43] ideas that were blended with
[38:45] Christianity by the polytheistic Romans
[38:48] and and as time goes on and and
[38:50] Christianity grew the Pagan Rome became
[38:54] Papa Rome and in this time Pagan Rome
[38:57] just intertwined all their Traditions
[38:59] with Christian teachings and they
[39:01] plugged in the names of Mary and Jesus
[39:04] and continued right on with mother and
[39:07] son worship but this never was something
[39:10] you find in the Bible this is something
[39:11] you find in Pagan Traditions down
[39:14] through history and and we see in Sardis
[39:16] what ends up happening is is their
[39:19] religion gets to the place where it's
[39:21] Cel the mother alone who gets all the
[39:25] praise and glory and honor and suddenly
[39:27] where it was at least Mother's Son
[39:30] suddenly son's getting none of the
[39:32] worship and it's all being bestowed upon
[39:34] the mother all the wor is being bestowed
[39:37] there and brother Bram says here he says
[39:39] all one needs to do is go over her
[39:42] various titles talking about Mary and
[39:45] recall the lovely attributes that are
[39:47] accorded to her by the Roman Church to
[39:50] understand where the religion of this
[39:53] age came from so we see that the the
[39:56] mother's son worship has has evolved to
[39:59] a place where it's more of a mother
[40:01] worship and it becomes mariolatry she is
[40:05] the one that has lifted up and it
[40:07] elevates the mother to a place with
[40:09] power and authority and a a place to be
[40:12] worshiped and a place to be prayed to as
[40:15] though she is deity and at the same time
[40:18] what this does is it they're elevating
[40:21] the woman the church they're they're
[40:23] elevating the church to a place near the
[40:26] church who's supposed to be be a woman
[40:28] who is under headship the church a woman
[40:30] who is supposed to be subject to Christ
[40:32] her husband subject to to Christ the
[40:35] word but they they they elevate her to a
[40:38] place above her husband above the word
[40:41] to where their Creeds is what matters
[40:43] their dogmas is what matters you don't
[40:45] necessarily have to look to what the
[40:47] word says or what the husband says but
[40:49] they've elevated the woman to a place of
[40:53] worship but she the church elevates her
[40:57] opinions over whatever the word
[41:00] says and so during this age we we we see
[41:03] that for the first time there is a real
[41:05] break away from the Catholic Church as
[41:09] is what we know as the the the
[41:11] Protestant Reformation and and those who
[41:13] break away begin to turn their worship
[41:16] away from the church away from what the
[41:18] Bishops say and they begin to come back
[41:20] to the word of God they began to turn
[41:24] their their their all their worship and
[41:26] and and pray ra to Faith in the Son of
[41:30] God and of this age we know the
[41:33] messenger is is Martin Luther and Martin
[41:36] Luther lives from 1483 to to
[41:40] 1546 and he's raised in Germany and he's
[41:42] educated in Latin at a young age and he
[41:45] he goes to University and enters into
[41:47] law school and it was during this time
[41:50] that he begins to search his life
[41:52] concerning his own spiritual condition
[41:55] and he leaves law school after after
[41:57] only six weeks and he enters into
[41:59] Monastery and and Luther becomes a
[42:01] priest and and and he becomes very
[42:03] respected for his understanding and for
[42:05] all his teaching on the word and yet
[42:08] still in all of this he did not have the
[42:11] peace or the satisfaction of Salvation
[42:14] he longed for it he says here he says
[42:16] though I lived as a monk without
[42:18] reproach think about that he can say
[42:20] without
[42:22] reproach he says I felt that I was a
[42:25] sinner before God with an extremely
[42:29] Disturbed
[42:30] conscience what was it we we've all been
[42:33] there no matter how good we're doing no
[42:34] matter what we try to do we just don't
[42:36] feel good
[42:38] enough and he says I had an extremely
[42:41] Disturbed conscience he he had lived a
[42:43] life of great of great Penance he had
[42:46] given up worldly pleasure he he had
[42:48] worked so hard to be good
[42:51] enough and yet all the rule
[42:54] following all the lining up all all the
[42:57] Penance all the self-sacrifice and yet
[43:00] he knew I still fall short I'm still not
[43:04] good enough he he knows that no matter
[43:06] what I do I'm still not righteous and
[43:09] his heart is crying out Lord what more
[43:11] can I do what what more can I do to to
[43:14] experience salvation where where can I
[43:16] turn his own testimony would declare
[43:19] that he was meditating day and night
[43:22] seeking
[43:23] God how can I ever measure up how how
[43:27] can we ever get to the place of
[43:28] Salvation how can I ever be good enough
[43:32] and he says in these times it finally
[43:34] struck him Romans
[43:36] 1:17 for therein is the righteousness of
[43:39] God revealed from Faith to Faith at is
[43:42] as it is written the just shall live by
[43:47] faith Galatians 3:11 but that no man is
[43:51] justified by the law in the sight of God
[43:53] it is evident for the just shall live by
[43:57] faith brother renam says the Evangelical
[44:00] truth of this scripture flooded his mind
[44:02] and he was set free from sin and he was
[44:05] born into the kingdom of God listen when
[44:08] you get to the place that you recognize
[44:10] I'm not good enough I can't do enough I
[44:13] can't line up enough I can't cross every
[44:15] tea and Dot every eye good enough but
[44:17] the only way I'm ever going to be good
[44:19] enough is by faith in the sacrifice the
[44:22] perfect one who shed his blood for me
[44:25] that's when you experience salvation
[44:27] that's when you experience the joy of
[44:29] your burdens being lifted cuz it ain't
[44:31] about you anymore and your goodness and
[44:33] your works and what you can do but it's
[44:35] what he has already done for
[44:41] you he began to preach and to defend the
[44:44] scriptures with a burning passion the
[44:47] word was his was his focus and the word
[44:50] alone because it was the word that had
[44:52] set him
[44:54] free and in so keeping with the word he
[44:56] soon finds that by staying with the word
[44:59] he comes in open conflict with the
[45:02] church because you can't line up with
[45:05] the church and line up with the word
[45:07] here in the denominational church
[45:08] because they don't go together and at
[45:11] first he wasn't even trying to come
[45:13] against the church he he his own
[45:14] writings was just would indicate he was
[45:16] just trying to stick with the word but
[45:19] it was the church that was straying away
[45:21] from that word and so they become an
[45:24] open conflict and and he writes what
[45:26] becomes known as the 95
[45:30] thesis it says thus when Leo the 10th
[45:33] became Pope and John tetel came to sell
[45:36] indulgences for sin Luther had no choice
[45:39] but to rise up against this antis
[45:41] scriptural teaching first he thundered
[45:43] from the pull pit against it and then he
[45:46] wrote his famous 95 thesis which on
[45:49] October 31st 1517 he nailed to the door
[45:53] of the castle church and what was this
[45:56] 95 thesis it it detailed Luther's
[45:59] opposition to what he saw as the
[46:01] Catholic Church's abuse and Corruption
[46:03] by Catholic clergy who were selling
[46:06] indulgences which were certificates
[46:09] supposed to reduce the punishment in
[46:12] purgatory for the sins committed by the
[46:15] purchasers or their loved
[46:17] ones and and and they're selling these
[46:19] to where it doesn't matter if you sin
[46:23] you you've already you've already paid
[46:24] for it you've bought the right to sin
[46:28] you have paid for this so you could even
[46:30] buy indulgences for sin future this
[46:34] wasn't even buying forgiveness it was
[46:36] saying I have a right to go and do
[46:38] whatever I want because I've already
[46:40] paid the church and I'm free to do
[46:42] whatever they were paying that they
[46:45] could sin and he rises up against this
[46:48] and he said and he even he would teach
[46:50] that what this did he said is it did
[46:52] away with true repentance in the heart
[46:54] of Christians it did away with with a
[46:57] true dying out because you didn't have
[46:58] to die out to sin you didn't have to be
[47:01] sorry for sin you could just pay the
[47:03] church and keep living exactly how you
[47:05] wanted to
[47:08] live and he cries out against it and and
[47:11] and history tells us that immediately
[47:14] immediately Rome perceived him as a
[47:17] threat listen as soon as you stand up
[47:19] for truth the devil recognize you as a
[47:21] threat as soon as you say I'm not
[47:24] backing off this this is the word of God
[47:26] this is the truth this is the revealed
[47:28] word of the hour prepare to come under
[47:30] attack because he recognizes that you
[47:33] are a threat to his
[47:36] kingdom there were calls for him to be
[47:39] excommunicated and for him to be burned
[47:41] at the
[47:42] stake his Fame and his teaching spread
[47:45] like wildfire and with it so did the
[47:47] Protestant
[47:49] Reformation I'm going to actually go
[47:51] ahead and try to use this now
[47:59] the
[48:01] Reformation in a short time Germany was
[48:03] Ablaze and the Reformation was on so
[48:07] what is the Reformation it was a
[48:09] movement in which Christians protested
[48:12] the Catholic church and began trying to
[48:15] reform the Church and it resulted in the
[48:18] beginning of
[48:19] protestantism brother brandham said
[48:21] God's time was ripe for a definite move
[48:25] that would be the beginning of the
[48:27] restoration of the church now as you
[48:29] study this and if you read through the
[48:30] church age book yourself you'll find
[48:32] where brother brandham points out the
[48:34] shortcomings and the flaws of this
[48:36] movement and he says they fell short and
[48:38] there was even flaws in Luther and
[48:40] different things but he says this it was
[48:43] the beginning of the restoration it was
[48:46] a move of god notice it wasn't
[48:48] everything but this was the beginning
[48:51] this was the starts of it you know
[48:54] you've been taught well and you and you
[48:55] know of the four beasts and the four
[48:57] anointings for each day the lion the ox
[49:00] the man and the eagle and what the
[49:02] Reformation was this was the age of man
[49:04] this was the anointing of man the day of
[49:07] the reformers where man's education and
[49:09] man's advancements and Technology
[49:11] allowed for the spreading of the word
[49:14] there were things like the printing
[49:15] press that that that came out as a a new
[49:18] invention and allowed for for for
[49:20] pamplets and sermons and essays and
[49:23] allowed for the Bible once again to be
[49:25] put in the hand of common men so it was
[49:28] no longer the church saying this is what
[49:30] it says but you could look at it for
[49:32] yourself and read it for yourself there
[49:35] were Generations there was thousands I
[49:37] may say millions of people who never one
[49:40] time had the opportunity to ever open up
[49:43] this book to ever read it for themselves
[49:46] they had no idea what was in it other
[49:48] than what the priest told them what was
[49:50] in it but now all of a sudden every man
[49:54] has access to it every woman has access
[49:56] to it it was a mighty move of God God
[49:59] putting it back in the hands of his
[50:01] people it was a powerful time as
[50:04] anointed men rose up and began to
[50:07] reform what they saw as
[50:09] wrong but the prophet would say it was
[50:12] an unfulfilled age they could have and
[50:16] should have pressed further into
[50:19] restoration instead of just settling for
[50:22] a
[50:23] Reformation they settled for a re
[50:28] and that the Bible tells us here in
[50:30] Revelation 3 And1 says I Know Thy works
[50:35] that thou has a name that thou livest
[50:38] and art dead in verse two speaking in
[50:41] this age he says for I have not found
[50:43] thy works perfect before God now in most
[50:48] of the ages the spirit would praise the
[50:50] True
[50:51] Vine and then he would denounce the
[50:54] false Vine so there would be praised
[50:57] along with the denunciation but here the
[50:59] entire message to the fifth age is a
[51:02] message of
[51:03] condemnation the entire thing there's no
[51:05] praise given there there's none given
[51:08] because yet many men rose up great
[51:11] anointed men to spread the message and
[51:13] yet as great as they were and as great
[51:15] as the move was their minds were still
[51:18] tainted by
[51:19] Catholicism their mind was still tainted
[51:22] by what they came out of yes they had
[51:24] more word yes they were closer to the
[51:26] truth but they pattered themselves after
[51:29] their
[51:30] mother the Catholic church instead of
[51:33] starting a new instead of building fresh
[51:36] building on the word they built on the
[51:38] foundations of Rome instead of taking
[51:41] this truth and starting over and and and
[51:43] instead of starting from scratch they
[51:46] tried to fix the church that was there
[51:48] they tried to fix the problems and what
[51:50] they ended up doing was taking the truth
[51:52] that they have and mixing it with the
[51:54] error that they already had
[51:57] so now they just have truth and error
[51:59] mixed and right here in this time as
[52:02] they're trying to break free and they're
[52:03] they're trying to break away from Rome
[52:05] they're trying to find their way to
[52:07] freedom and right here in the midst of
[52:09] that they're snared by
[52:12] denomination they begin to split hairs
[52:14] over doctrines they begin to make camps
[52:18] along lines of disagreement and you see
[52:20] the attitude of the Corinthians begin to
[52:22] rise up that I am of Paul and I am of
[52:25] sephus
[52:28] it begins to Splinter the body well well
[52:30] who's going to be the most influential
[52:32] leader who's the most influential
[52:34] reformer which one is the most right and
[52:39] they begin to devour one another and
[52:41] fight one another more bitterly than
[52:42] they fought against the Catholic
[52:45] Church listen as a message Community we
[52:48] can't turn into that to where we begin
[52:52] to fight one another over our
[52:53] differences instead of uniting around
[52:55] the things that we have the
[52:57] same there's a glorious message that has
[53:00] called us out and we have one goal and
[53:02] that's to take a Rapture and we get to a
[53:04] place where we're fighting and we're
[53:05] bickering and we're pointing well this
[53:07] church says this and this church says
[53:08] that listen let me put it to you like
[53:10] this to settle the issue I might be
[53:12] wrong
[53:14] sometimes you might be wrong sometimes
[53:17] ministers at other churches might be
[53:19] wrong sometimes but the message is right
[53:23] the message is always right it is the
[53:26] truth that is the revealed word for the
[53:28] day so don't get caught up in this and
[53:30] that just remember the message is the
[53:33] truth it is the
[53:36] truth quotes don't fight
[53:40] quotes our understanding of quotes
[53:43] fights other men's understanding of
[53:46] quotes but quotes do not contradict one
[53:49] another they never have they
[53:52] can't they begin to devour one another
[53:55] and fight one another another and
[53:57] commenius
[54:00] wrote each Church reckons itself as the
[54:03] true one or at least as the purest
[54:05] truest part of it all part of it while
[54:08] among themselves they persecute each
[54:10] other with the bitterest
[54:12] hatred of the new
[54:15] birth and how a man must be changed into
[54:17] the likeness of Christ to become a
[54:19] partaker of the divine nature scarcely
[54:22] anything is said May that never be said
[54:25] about our church
[54:27] May that never be said in the ranks of
[54:28] the message that the new birth isn't
[54:30] focused on listen brother Bram comes and
[54:32] he preaches the token and he says it's
[54:34] the highlight of my
[54:36] Ministry the token the New Birth the
[54:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost it must be
[54:41] preached it must be what we attain to it
[54:44] must be what we strive
[54:46] for but he says it got to the place
[54:49] where scarcely anything was said he says
[54:52] the faith has been split into a thousand
[54:54] little parts and you're made a heretic
[54:57] if there is one of them you do not
[54:59] accept what can help only the one thing
[55:02] needful return to Christ looking to
[55:05] Christ as the only leader and walking in
[55:07] his footsteps setting aside all other
[55:09] ways until we all reach the goal and
[55:12] have come to the unity of the faith
[55:15] that's one thing Satan can't stand and
[55:17] he doesn't want is for us to be unified
[55:19] in our faith listen if one can chase a
[55:22] th and two 10,000 he wants to keep you
[55:25] separated he doesn't want you binding
[55:27] your faith together and recognizing no
[55:29] matter our differences you are my
[55:31] brother you are my sister we have one
[55:34] common goal we are to be unified in the
[55:37] faith and he battles that and he fights
[55:40] against that he said the faith has been
[55:43] split into a thousand little parts and
[55:46] the spirit of God finds it
[55:49] deplorable he finds it deplorable and by
[55:52] the second generation they're right back
[55:54] under the wing of the Catholic Church
[55:56] going right back to the prison that they
[55:58] had just been freed
[56:00] from they elevated churches they lifted
[56:03] up the names of great great men they
[56:06] became
[56:08] lutherans God wasn't wanting lutherans
[56:10] he was wanting
[56:12] Christians don't ever settle for I'm in
[56:15] the message or I go to evening light
[56:17] Tabernacle or this is my pastor God's
[56:19] not looking for that he's looking for
[56:21] Christians for people sold out and
[56:23] dedicated to him and him alone filled
[56:26] with the spirit living for him shining a
[56:28] light say he's the same yesterday today
[56:30] and forever
[56:32] [Music]
[56:33] Christians that's what he's looking
[56:36] for he's looking for people that are
[56:38] sold out people that stand for him lives
[56:43] dedicated to him someone who is
[56:46] identified with him so that on that day
[56:48] he may identify himself with
[56:51] them that's what I want is for him on
[56:53] that day to identify himself with me
[56:56] amen he's not going to ask a one of us
[56:58] where we went to
[57:01] church he's not going to ask you did you
[57:03] believe the
[57:05] message he's looking for the blood tag
[57:09] he's looking for the Seal of God the
[57:11] token of God do you have
[57:13] it that's what he's looking
[57:16] for God rebukes the age because he had
[57:20] made a way of escape and they tasted
[57:23] that freedom but they didn't go all the
[57:25] way
[57:27] if there's a theme to our study tonight
[57:29] what we're talking about tonight it's we
[57:30] got to go all the
[57:32] way we cannot stop short but we must go
[57:35] all the
[57:37] way that's why there's no praise that's
[57:40] given as he addresses the church only
[57:43] condemnation because they chained
[57:45] themselves right back to what they came
[57:47] out of yes many great things were done
[57:49] yes it was a mighty move yes it was the
[57:52] beginning of the restoration but they
[57:54] failed to take on his name they became
[57:57] lutherans and Calvinists and
[58:01] Armenians they took on the names of
[58:03] churches they were living a name but
[58:06] they were
[58:09] dead the eulogy in Revelation 3 and4
[58:12] says Thou Hast a few names even in
[58:14] Sardis which have not defiled their
[58:17] garments and they shall walk with me in
[58:20] white for they are worthy now we know
[58:25] that there's two V finds the true and
[58:27] the false the false but here we see God
[58:30] is speaking to the church in this age
[58:34] the true and the false lump together as
[58:36] the church he's addressing them all at
[58:39] once and and even though he has rebuked
[58:41] the entire age in this moment he says
[58:45] there are a few names all right he says
[58:48] there are a few there there there's a
[58:50] few names there's some who are right
[58:52] even though the whole age is is full of
[58:55] error there is a little minority group
[58:57] that has stayed
[58:59] true he says he he says there is a group
[59:02] that would not compromise and that group
[59:05] I'm going to reward they're going to
[59:07] walk with me they're going to be robed
[59:10] in white yes it had been a chaotic age
[59:12] it had been a rebuked age it had been an
[59:14] unfulfilled age and the word even
[59:17] declared that what they had was getting
[59:19] ready to die it was getting ready to die
[59:22] but in the midst of all that he says
[59:25] everything ain't lost
[59:26] I got some names I got a few people that
[59:29] no matter how dark it's getting down
[59:31] there they're still staying true no
[59:33] matter how dark it's getting they're
[59:34] still shining the light they're
[59:36] following the light of the revealed day
[59:38] they're standing they're identifying
[59:40] with me they're true to me and I'm going
[59:42] to reward
[59:44] them he says I've got a people and they
[59:48] shall walk with me in white for they are
[59:53] worthy Prophet God says for they shall
[59:55] walk with him and and white they had
[59:57] identified themselves with him on Earth
[1:00:00] and now he would identify himself with
[1:00:02] them in the New Jerusalem and how
[1:00:05] marvelous will be that
[1:00:08] identification how awesome is this you
[1:00:10] were identified with him on Earth and
[1:00:13] he's saying now I'm going to identify
[1:00:14] myself with you in the New Jerusalem
[1:00:17] It's a Wonderful thought that no matter
[1:00:19] what the cost no matter how hard the
[1:00:21] road is how difficult our life is if
[1:00:24] we'll identify with him here
[1:00:26] then he's going to identify with us
[1:00:28] there he's going to stand for you there
[1:00:32] hallelujah it's going to be worth it all
[1:00:34] Church on that day every trugg struggle
[1:00:36] you ever had every trial you ever face
[1:00:38] every hardship you think you went
[1:00:40] through when he says that I'm going to
[1:00:42] stand up for you in front of my father
[1:00:44] and all the Holy Angels and you hear
[1:00:46] your name called by our lord Jesus when
[1:00:49] the role is Called Up Yonder and you
[1:00:50] hear your name it's going to be worth
[1:00:53] everything you ever went through every
[1:00:55] trial every situation every sickness
[1:00:57] every battle it will be worth it
[1:01:01] all to hear him identify you as one of
[1:01:04] his
[1:01:10] own for they are worthy he says do you
[1:01:14] realize who's saying this it is Jesus
[1:01:18] the worthy one himself this is the only
[1:01:21] one who is accounted worthy to take the
[1:01:23] book out of him who sits upon the throne
[1:01:26] throne and now this worthy one is saying
[1:01:28] to his Saints you are worthy what did it
[1:01:34] say in Luke 21:36 watch ye therefore and
[1:01:37] pray always that you may be accounted
[1:01:41] worthy to escape all these things that
[1:01:43] shall come to pass and to stand before
[1:01:45] the son of man he says this pray always
[1:01:48] that you be accounted worthy and now
[1:01:51] here he is showing that someone's going
[1:01:53] to be accounted worthy some someone is
[1:01:56] going to escape oh but brother Aaron I'm
[1:02:00] So
[1:02:01] Unworthy me
[1:02:04] too the word says you're
[1:02:06] worthy but but brother Aaron I I'm I'm
[1:02:09] So Unworthy yes but because we were
[1:02:12] unworthy he sent the worthy one he came
[1:02:15] himself and took on flesh weep not weep
[1:02:19] not there is a worthy one it was the son
[1:02:22] of the Living God he was worthy to pay
[1:02:24] sin debt he was worthy to break the
[1:02:26] seals off the book he's worthy of your
[1:02:29] praise he's worthy enough to pay for
[1:02:31] your salvation he's the worthy one and
[1:02:34] because of that and because of our
[1:02:36] identification in him then our
[1:02:38] unworthiness has become worthiness
[1:02:41] because we've taken on his
[1:02:43] righteousness he is the worthy
[1:02:46] one
[1:02:48] Hallelujah and he says because of that
[1:02:51] you're going to walk with him in white
[1:02:53] think about that think think about that
[1:02:56] the purity of white not some spotted
[1:02:59] garment not something that identifies
[1:03:01] you with the sins that you committed
[1:03:03] here on Earth you're not going to wear
[1:03:05] something as you walk around they can
[1:03:07] look and oh he failed a lot oh he messed
[1:03:09] up a lot oh he had a lot of unbelief oh
[1:03:13] he backslid for years he went in and out
[1:03:15] in and out look at His Garment no sir
[1:03:17] we're going to be wearing the same
[1:03:18] garment as he's wearing identified just
[1:03:21] like him His Garment is pure and white
[1:03:23] your garment is pure and white not
[1:03:25] stained with sin but one that says
[1:03:27] washed clean pure
[1:03:30] worthy oh but I did so much no there
[1:03:33] you're wearing a white garment you are
[1:03:37] worthy
[1:03:39] Hallelujah the Spotless virtuous bride
[1:03:43] of Jesus
[1:03:47] Christ the promise to the
[1:03:50] Overcomer in verse five he that
[1:03:53] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[1:03:56] white rment we see that reiterated again
[1:03:59] he wants you to know how you're going to
[1:04:00] look what you're going to be wearing
[1:04:03] that you're going to be
[1:04:04] clean and I will not blot out his name
[1:04:08] out of the book of life but I will
[1:04:10] confess his name before my father and
[1:04:13] his holy
[1:04:15] angels we see once again the white robe
[1:04:18] and and then he says and I will not blot
[1:04:22] his name out of The Book of Life
[1:04:27] as we look at this we're going to see
[1:04:29] four different groups of
[1:04:32] names some that were there from before
[1:04:35] the foundation of the world in an
[1:04:37] eternal section of the book of life that
[1:04:39] can never be
[1:04:40] removed some are in the book of life but
[1:04:44] they're not part of the Bride they're
[1:04:46] granted life at the
[1:04:48] Judgment some names you'll see in the
[1:04:50] third group their names are removed from
[1:04:52] the book of life and finally some names
[1:04:55] that were never
[1:04:57] there never recorded on the book of life
[1:05:01] and as we dis dissect these groups it's
[1:05:04] important that we understand that God is
[1:05:08] omniscient God is all
[1:05:12] knowing he not only knows but he has
[1:05:15] always known there's not one that will
[1:05:18] be saved or lost that he doesn't already
[1:05:23] know so moving forward with that brother
[1:05:26] brandham says here when we get to this
[1:05:27] portion of the church age book
[1:05:30] referencing this topic of the book of
[1:05:31] life he says once again we come to a
[1:05:35] most difficult portion of the
[1:05:38] word so as we know that going in I want
[1:05:41] to approach it carefully so that we get
[1:05:43] a clear understanding of it he talks
[1:05:46] about how the calvinist and the
[1:05:48] Armenians will both use this
[1:05:51] scripture to to suit their own purposes
[1:05:54] as it relates to to predestination and
[1:05:57] to
[1:05:57] Salvation And he says some also say that
[1:06:00] this book of life now listen close is
[1:06:03] not the Lamb's Book of Life but as usual
[1:06:07] when one regards a verse superficially
[1:06:10] he comes up with a
[1:06:12] superficial
[1:06:14] understanding and there's so much in
[1:06:16] this that brother brandham took about 20
[1:06:18] pages in the church age book to deal
[1:06:20] with it and then he comes around as he's
[1:06:23] preaching the invisible Union of the
[1:06:24] bride and he deals with the a great deal
[1:06:26] more to make sure there's still no
[1:06:28] confusion and in that sermon he I think
[1:06:31] it's right about the time where the
[1:06:32] church age book was coming available and
[1:06:34] so people didn't even have it in their
[1:06:36] hands yet but they were going to be
[1:06:38] receiving it at this meeting and so in
[1:06:40] that context he says this here it brings
[1:06:44] into view the two books that's going to
[1:06:47] be mysterious to you when you read the
[1:06:50] book of The Seven Church ages the two
[1:06:53] books book of life
[1:06:56] and one says you can put your name on it
[1:06:58] you can never come off other one says
[1:07:00] you take his name out of The Book of
[1:07:02] Life he's just saying there's going to
[1:07:04] be some stuff in here that's going to be
[1:07:06] confusing to you and he wants to clear
[1:07:08] it up he goes on to say in works as
[1:07:10] Faith Express when you get the book
[1:07:12] you're going to see maybe a little
[1:07:13] confusion there of what I said the two
[1:07:17] books of life it's the same
[1:07:22] book
[1:07:24] okay book but one of them is your
[1:07:26] natural birth and the other one is your
[1:07:29] spiritual birth he goes on to say the
[1:07:32] Baptist believe there's two separate
[1:07:33] books and in one way it is two separate
[1:07:36] books hold on
[1:07:40] now and in another way it isn't two
[1:07:43] separate books oh
[1:07:46] my but let's go back to this in the
[1:07:49] first quote it's the same
[1:07:53] book there's only one book of life but
[1:07:56] there is a section of that book that is
[1:07:59] an eternal
[1:08:01] section where names was written before
[1:08:04] the foundation of the world and they can
[1:08:07] never be
[1:08:08] removed never be removed it doesn't
[1:08:12] matter what the devil does how he comes
[1:08:14] against you how he attacks you what your
[1:08:16] struggle was today nothing will separate
[1:08:19] you nothing's going to separate you from
[1:08:21] the love of God there ain't no lie
[1:08:23] that's been following you there ain't no
[1:08:25] Str that's been following you no
[1:08:26] depression no anxiety no family trouble
[1:08:29] no up down in and out if your name was
[1:08:31] written on the last book of life before
[1:08:33] the foundation of the world in this
[1:08:35] section nothing can ever take it off you
[1:08:39] will be there and he will identify with
[1:08:43] you on that day in the rad call you will
[1:08:45] hear your name
[1:08:49] called but they are two books in the
[1:08:53] same way that the Bible
[1:08:56] has the Old and New
[1:08:59] Testament there are two different parts
[1:09:02] to this Bible but you would never say
[1:09:05] well well it's it's it's it's two
[1:09:07] different Bibles no it's the same book
[1:09:10] and the Book of uh this book is the same
[1:09:13] with different
[1:09:15] sections of the
[1:09:18] book see life is sacred to
[1:09:21] God and he records
[1:09:24] life in a
[1:09:26] book your life my life neighbor life
[1:09:30] people you saw at Walmart's life life he
[1:09:34] records life in a
[1:09:36] book but this natural life that we have
[1:09:40] here is a perversion of what God
[1:09:43] intended our life to
[1:09:45] be it's been perverted by the fall and
[1:09:49] this life this natural life is
[1:09:51] associated with sin and with death
[1:09:55] that's that's why we have to be born
[1:09:58] again that's why this life isn't good
[1:10:00] enough we have to be born again because
[1:10:03] our natural life is recorded in the book
[1:10:06] and our Deeds Done in the natural life
[1:10:08] and that's associated with sin and death
[1:10:11] the nature that came by our first birth
[1:10:13] first Birth has to die in order that we
[1:10:16] might be United with another
[1:10:19] nature brother Brown says your name of
[1:10:21] your first nature was born and put in a
[1:10:25] the book of life and all your Deeds was
[1:10:28] wrote in it to everything you done under
[1:10:33] that nature was put in a book called The
[1:10:37] Book of Life so all life is recorded in
[1:10:40] the book of life but not all names are
[1:10:44] written in the Eternal section of the
[1:10:46] Lamb's Book of Life not all names are
[1:10:49] written there brother Brandon we're go
[1:10:51] on to tell us there's not one scripture
[1:10:53] that tells us that God is current
[1:10:55] compiling
[1:10:56] names all of this was done according to
[1:10:59] God's for knowledge before the
[1:11:01] foundation of the world and it isn't as
[1:11:04] simple as well there's two groups and
[1:11:08] one group heard and didn't accept so
[1:11:10] their name isn't written and one group
[1:11:12] heard and did accept and so their name
[1:11:14] is written it's not that
[1:11:17] simple as a matter of fact well look
[1:11:21] here brother brandham says we will
[1:11:23] actually show by scripture that
[1:11:25] multitudes who are not even born again
[1:11:29] will go into eternal life as strange as
[1:11:32] this may sound it's certainly
[1:11:35] true my so we got names on the record
[1:11:39] that can never be removed names that
[1:11:41] will be removed names that were never
[1:11:44] recorded and people not born again going
[1:11:46] into eternal
[1:11:48] life we got some things to sort out here
[1:11:51] yes one more to drive this point home
[1:11:54] the book Book of Life to begin with
[1:11:57] there is no basis for the claims that
[1:11:58] the Lamb's Book of Life is not the same
[1:12:01] as the Book of Life you can see that
[1:12:04] though there are other books mentioned
[1:12:05] there is always the reference to one
[1:12:07] book containing names in the Revelation
[1:12:11] it is called the Lamb's Book of Life or
[1:12:13] The Book of Life Lamb's Book of Life or
[1:12:17] the book of
[1:12:18] life now we mentioned earlier that one
[1:12:21] of the groups
[1:12:22] is of people or names
[1:12:25] are names that are removed from the book
[1:12:28] and we're going to look at that for a
[1:12:29] little
[1:12:30] bit let's start here where the 70 have
[1:12:34] returned to
[1:12:35] Jesus Luke 10:18 and he said unto them I
[1:12:38] beheld Satan as lightning fall from
[1:12:41] Heaven behold I give unto you power to
[1:12:44] tread on serpents and scorpions and over
[1:12:46] all the power of the enemy and nothing
[1:12:48] shall by any means hurt you
[1:12:51] notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that
[1:12:54] the spirits are subject unto you but
[1:12:56] rather Rejoice because your names are
[1:13:00] written in heaven notice their names are
[1:13:04] written in
[1:13:06] heaven so as Jesus is is saying this
[1:13:08] he's speaking to the 70 what do we know
[1:13:11] about the
[1:13:14] 70 were they in the upper
[1:13:17] room were they good solid people that
[1:13:19] followed Jesus all the way to his
[1:13:21] crucifixion no this is right before they
[1:13:23] turn and leave him and say we don't want
[1:13:24] nothing to do do with you but he just
[1:13:27] said your names are written in heaven
[1:13:29] not only that if you read a couple
[1:13:31] verses down you'll realize that he's not
[1:13:32] just speaking to the 70 but he's also
[1:13:34] speaking to the 12 which means Judas is
[1:13:36] standing there and he tells Judas
[1:13:39] Rejoice because your name is written in
[1:13:44] heaven
[1:13:47] my Judas is standing there Judas is
[1:13:51] casting out devils in Jesus name Judas
[1:13:55] numbered with the 12 and according to
[1:13:56] John 13 Joseph was chosen by
[1:14:00] Jesus and before the day of Pentecost
[1:14:02] before the upper room he had a part in
[1:14:04] the
[1:14:06] ministry look at this the part that
[1:14:09] Judas obtained amongst the 12 and then
[1:14:11] loss was neither inferior to the
[1:14:12] ministries of the other 11 nor was it a
[1:14:15] devilish foreign Ministry interjected
[1:14:17] among the ministries of the others Judas
[1:14:20] a devil lost a god-given ho Holy Ghost
[1:14:28] Ministry and killed himself and went to
[1:14:31] his own place his name was even in the
[1:14:34] Book of Life we can't dispute that
[1:14:36] because the scripture just said
[1:14:39] it but his name was blotted
[1:14:43] out now let's
[1:14:45] find here in the Old Testament where God
[1:14:48] did the exact same thing we're going to
[1:14:51] look at this for a second just to set a
[1:14:52] precedent for this happening
[1:14:55] in First Kings 12 we find that reabo he
[1:14:59] he treated the people of Israel harshly
[1:15:01] when he became king and they rebelled
[1:15:04] against him and and jeroboam he he took
[1:15:06] the TW the 10 Northern tribes and he
[1:15:10] became king over them so the kingdom
[1:15:12] became divided you had you had 10
[1:15:14] Northern tribes and two Southern tribes
[1:15:17] but Jerusalem was in the
[1:15:20] South with the two with King reabo
[1:15:26] and jeroboam was afraid that if the
[1:15:28] people went down to the temple in
[1:15:30] Jerusalem and they began to worship
[1:15:32] there then they would want to stay or
[1:15:35] that they would once again want to be
[1:15:37] part of raam's
[1:15:39] kingdom and it says here in First Kings
[1:15:42] 12 and
[1:15:43] 27 if this people this is jeroboam
[1:15:46] speaking go up to do sacrifice in the
[1:15:49] house of the Lord at Jerusalem then
[1:15:51] shall the heart of this people turn
[1:15:53] again unto their lord even to roboam
[1:15:57] King of Judah and they shall kill me and
[1:16:00] go again to roboam King of Judah so he
[1:16:03] doesn't want them to go worship where
[1:16:05] they're supposed to worship he doesn't
[1:16:06] want them going to the temple because
[1:16:09] he's afraid that they're going to get
[1:16:10] down there and want to stay there and
[1:16:11] rejoin with that so to keep them from
[1:16:14] going to Jerusalem to to worship
[1:16:16] jeroboam sets up two golden calves for
[1:16:19] the people to worship one is in the city
[1:16:21] of Dan in the inheritance of Dan and one
[1:16:24] one is in the city of bethl in the in
[1:16:27] the um in inheritance of
[1:16:33] Ephraim and it says
[1:16:37] here whereupon the king took counsel and
[1:16:39] made two calves of gold and said unto
[1:16:42] them it is too much for you to go up to
[1:16:44] Jerusalem Behold thy Gods o Israel which
[1:16:48] brought thee up out of the land of Egypt
[1:16:51] and he set one in in bethl and the other
[1:16:54] he put in Dan and this thing became a
[1:16:57] sin for the people for the people went
[1:16:59] to worship before the one even unto Dan
[1:17:04] now I want to stop right here and show
[1:17:06] you this in the scripture let's look
[1:17:08] back at the golden calf incident in the
[1:17:11] wilderness if you'll remember this ain't
[1:17:13] the first time that we've had golden
[1:17:14] calves made to
[1:17:15] worship so before we even get to their
[1:17:18] punishment and what God's going to do
[1:17:19] let's look back and see some
[1:17:21] foreshadowing and see what God's going
[1:17:23] to do for this
[1:17:26] worship and it came to pass on the
[1:17:28] tomorrow this is after they have
[1:17:30] worshiped the golden calf that Moses
[1:17:32] said unto the people you have sinned a
[1:17:34] great sin and now I will go up unto the
[1:17:36] Lord per Adventure I shall make an
[1:17:38] atonement for your sin and Moses
[1:17:40] returned unto the Lord and said oh this
[1:17:42] people have sinned a great sin and have
[1:17:43] made them gods of gold yet now if thou
[1:17:46] Wilt forgive their sin and if not blot
[1:17:49] me I pray out of thy book which thou
[1:17:51] Hast written and the Lord said unto
[1:17:53] Moses whosoever has sinned against me
[1:17:57] him will I blot out of my
[1:18:02] book what is it that God's telling them
[1:18:04] about idolatry if you turn to idolatry
[1:18:08] or you sin against me what's going to
[1:18:09] happen to your name in The Book of Life
[1:18:12] it's going to be removed blotted out we
[1:18:16] see it in Deuteronomy 29 16- 20 he says
[1:18:20] for ye know how we have dwelt in the
[1:18:22] land of Egypt and how we came through
[1:18:24] the ations which you pass by and you
[1:18:26] have seen their Abominations and their
[1:18:28] idols and wood and stone silver and gold
[1:18:30] which were among them lest there should
[1:18:32] be among you man or woman or family or
[1:18:35] tribe whose heart turneth away this day
[1:18:37] from the Lord Our God to go and serve
[1:18:39] the gods of these nations lest there
[1:18:41] should be among you a root that beareth
[1:18:43] GA and wormwood skipping down to verse
[1:18:45] 20 the Lord will not spare him but the
[1:18:48] anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall
[1:18:50] smoke against that man and all the
[1:18:52] curses that are written in this book
[1:18:54] book shall lie upon him all the curses
[1:18:58] are going to lie upon Him idolatry is
[1:19:01] not something God plays with it'll get
[1:19:04] your name blotted
[1:19:07] out the tribe and the people who turn to
[1:19:10] idolatry we're going to have their names
[1:19:12] blotted out so now I'm going to come
[1:19:13] back to
[1:19:14] jeroboam back to our
[1:19:18] story it says just down to verse 30 and
[1:19:22] this thing became a sin for the people
[1:19:24] went to worship before the one even unto
[1:19:28] Dan now one was placed in Dan one was
[1:19:30] placed in bethl bethl is a part of of of
[1:19:32] the inheritance of Ephraim okay so
[1:19:35] here's what I'm showing youall this for
[1:19:37] if you'll skip ahead to the Book of
[1:19:39] Revelation Revelation chapter 7 when the
[1:19:43] list of the tribes of the 144 that that
[1:19:47] the 144,000 are going to come out
[1:19:51] of Dan and Ephraim are missing
[1:19:55] you will not find them in the Book of
[1:19:58] Revelation because they turn to
[1:20:02] idolatry and so you look over here names
[1:20:06] tribes people that were that were there
[1:20:08] part of God's chosen people but they
[1:20:11] turned aside and you get over into the
[1:20:14] Book of Revelation and their names are
[1:20:17] missing because of idolatry God wipes
[1:20:20] those two tribes plac from under Heaven
[1:20:22] they're not even listed in the book of
[1:20:24] Revelation Hosea 4:17 says Ephraim is
[1:20:28] joined to Idols let him
[1:20:33] alone prophet of God says that is
[1:20:35] exactly as it is for now Israel is back
[1:20:38] in Palestine and soon the Lord will seal
[1:20:41] 144,000 of them but from that number Dan
[1:20:44] and Ephraim are
[1:20:46] missing he says that great God who is
[1:20:49] bringing Israel back to Palestine knows
[1:20:51] exactly which tribe every true Israelite
[1:20:53] is from and from all the
[1:20:56] assembled 144,000 Dan and Ephraim will
[1:21:01] be
[1:21:02] missing blotted out they had a
[1:21:07] part they were
[1:21:09] called they were chosen people Judas was
[1:21:13] a chosen
[1:21:14] disciple listen the children of Israel
[1:21:17] they they left Egypt called out by
[1:21:18] Prophet following the pillar of fire all
[1:21:21] of them under the blood of the
[1:21:23] sacrificial lamb all of them went
[1:21:25] through the waters of the Red Sea all of
[1:21:27] them enjoyed the
[1:21:28] Miracles but then they came to Moab and
[1:21:31] joined in the Feast of bpor and there
[1:21:34] they
[1:21:35] died what
[1:21:38] happened they came out but they didn't
[1:21:41] go all the
[1:21:42] way they came out but they stopped
[1:21:46] short they came out but somewhere along
[1:21:49] the way they got caught up and we're the
[1:21:51] chosen people we've got a prophet we're
[1:21:53] following the pillar of far and that's
[1:21:56] enough and so they didn't never cross
[1:22:00] over and because they stopped short
[1:22:02] their names are blotted out of the
[1:22:04] Lamb's Book of
[1:22:06] Life he says there are
[1:22:09] people this quote struck me so hard as I
[1:22:13] was studying who seem involved in the
[1:22:17] things of God Almost 100%
[1:22:24] I don't know how it's to interpret
[1:22:27] this he says they are like Judas the
[1:22:30] line I focused on is almost
[1:22:33] 100% and maybe my interpretation is
[1:22:37] harsh but what I'm seeing is if you're
[1:22:38] 99% you're like
[1:22:43] Judas I am 99% sold out they are like
[1:22:49] Judas I've given God almost everything
[1:22:53] they are like Judas
[1:22:57] I've come out and I've battled I've been
[1:22:59] through so much I just I just I just
[1:23:01] can't take that last step they are like
[1:23:05] Judas Almost
[1:23:08] 100% even in like Tabernacle we can't be
[1:23:11] an almost almost church we can't have
[1:23:13] almost lives with almost almost homes
[1:23:15] with almost born again we got to be sold
[1:23:18] out all the way filled with the spirit
[1:23:20] dedicated we can't stop short we're not
[1:23:23] like Judas we're not like Judas but
[1:23:26] we're going to the upper room and we're
[1:23:28] going to repent and be baptized and
[1:23:30] filled with the spirit we're pushing all
[1:23:32] the way to a rapture we can't be tainted
[1:23:35] with the things of the world with our
[1:23:37] own ideas and our own beliefs we can't
[1:23:39] be
[1:23:42] almost we got to be all the way
[1:23:47] dedicated and not just
[1:23:50] reformed that's why this age God found
[1:23:53] no pleasure in it they were just
[1:23:54] reformed he didn't want reformed he
[1:23:56] wanted
[1:23:57] restored don't just reform your life to
[1:24:00] where we just end up you know being a a
[1:24:02] bunch of message Amish with a set of
[1:24:05] rules you got to dress like this you got
[1:24:07] to do this we do this and it comes a
[1:24:09] lifestyle and people are happy in their
[1:24:11] lifestyle hey I think it's a good
[1:24:14] lifestyle but that ain't what it's
[1:24:16] about it's not just a lifestyle but it's
[1:24:19] a life reproducing The Life of Christ
[1:24:22] here on Earth filled with the spirit
[1:24:25] we can't just be reformed but we got to
[1:24:27] be restored to the image that he had of
[1:24:30] us before the foundation of the world
[1:24:32] restored to the Spotless sinless
[1:24:34] virtuous bride of Jesus Christ that's so
[1:24:37] much more than a Reformation that is a
[1:24:40] restoration restored back to who you
[1:24:43] really
[1:24:45] are not keeping some of who you want to
[1:24:48] be and mixing in some
[1:24:50] truths that's
[1:24:52] Reformation we got to go all the way to
[1:24:55] the New Birth notice these people whose
[1:24:58] names and these tribes whose names are
[1:25:00] removed are religious people these
[1:25:04] ain't scum of the earth as you might
[1:25:06] would say or
[1:25:07] whatever these are religious people
[1:25:10] church people might I say it called
[1:25:15] people people who were part of the
[1:25:18] movement people who worship God
[1:25:24] brother Brown says like Judas they
[1:25:26] didn't go all the way see Judas was
[1:25:28] chosen of God he was instructed in truth
[1:25:32] he shared knowledge of the
[1:25:37] Mysteries that's one thing people like
[1:25:38] to say you know well it's not all that
[1:25:40] important about the moving of the spirit
[1:25:42] and the healings and the Miracles Judas
[1:25:44] had that too well Judas also understood
[1:25:46] the
[1:25:50] Mysteries he had a Ministry of power
[1:25:52] granted unto him and he healed the sick
[1:25:55] and cast out devils in jesus' name but
[1:25:57] when The Showdown came he sold out for
[1:26:00] gold and political power he did not go
[1:26:03] up to Pentecost to receive the spirit of
[1:26:05] God he was devoid of the spirit make no
[1:26:08] mistake about it a person that has truly
[1:26:10] baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body
[1:26:12] of Christ receiving the fullness of the
[1:26:14] spirit will be in the word all the way
[1:26:19] that is the evidence of being baptized
[1:26:21] with the Holy Ghost Judas failed
[1:26:23] multitudes faed right there and when
[1:26:25] they fail to go on in that word their
[1:26:28] names are taken off the book of
[1:26:32] life I'm not going to fit this
[1:26:34] pattern I'm not going to be one that
[1:26:36] comes most of the way but then stops I'm
[1:26:39] going to go all the way with the word
[1:26:41] I'm going to go on with God I'm going to
[1:26:43] cross over look the waters may be raging
[1:26:45] but I know I can strike the river and I
[1:26:47] can say where is the god of Elijah and I
[1:26:50] know I can cross over listen I don't
[1:26:52] care what you're facing today I don't
[1:26:53] care off far you've come tonight do not
[1:26:55] stop where you are but press on press on
[1:26:58] to more victories press on even into the
[1:27:01] battle don't forget there's an angel
[1:27:02] that goes before you to scatter your
[1:27:04] enemies and to win the battle for you
[1:27:06] press on tonight into more go on with
[1:27:10] God go on in the word go on in the
[1:27:12] spirit whatever you do don't stop but
[1:27:15] press in listen more than ever before we
[1:27:18] got to be preaching the new birth more
[1:27:20] than ever before we got to get people to
[1:27:22] the upper room that's where Judas
[1:27:26] failed he wouldn't go to the upper room
[1:27:29] he couldn't go to the upper room you
[1:27:32] must be born again evening light
[1:27:35] Tabernacle and I say tonight I don't
[1:27:37] care how long you've been wandering
[1:27:38] around in the wilderness how long you've
[1:27:40] been Justified how long you've been
[1:27:42] Sanctified how long you've been failing
[1:27:44] around the same Mountain I say tonight
[1:27:46] is a night you can cross over tonight is
[1:27:48] a night you can step into the baptism of
[1:27:50] the Holy Ghost you can accept the new
[1:27:52] birth you can experience the new birth
[1:27:54] you can have your life changed forever
[1:27:56] you don't have to go around the mountain
[1:27:58] one more time but you can go forward and
[1:28:00] possess the land and possess the promise
[1:28:03] that belongs to
[1:28:06] you don't rest in being
[1:28:12] called Don't rest that you have come out
[1:28:16] but you must press
[1:28:17] in
[1:28:19] Hallelujah names taken off the
[1:28:23] book we've covered names taken off the
[1:28:26] book and I'm trying to
[1:28:29] hurry but I want to look at those now
[1:28:31] that are granted
[1:28:33] life we're going read in Matthew 25 it
[1:28:36] says when the son of man shall come in
[1:28:38] his glory and all the Holy Angels with
[1:28:40] him then shall he sit upon the throne of
[1:28:42] his glory and before him shall be
[1:28:45] gathered all nations and he shall
[1:28:46] separate them one from another as a
[1:28:48] Shepherd divideth his sheep from the
[1:28:51] goats now brother Brandon makes it clear
[1:28:53] here these aren't sheep and goats he
[1:28:56] said it's
[1:28:57] as he said the Sheep are already with
[1:29:01] him in the
[1:29:02] throne the true sheep the Bride of Jesus
[1:29:05] is not standing at the white Throne
[1:29:06] judgment being judged so he says this is
[1:29:09] as these aren't there aren't sheep he
[1:29:12] says and he shall set the sheep on his
[1:29:15] right hand but the goats on the left
[1:29:17] then shall the king say unto them on his
[1:29:19] right hand Come Ye blessed of my father
[1:29:21] inherit the Kingdom prepared for you
[1:29:23] from the foundation of the world for I
[1:29:25] was hunger and you gave me meat I was
[1:29:27] thirsty and you gave me drink I was a
[1:29:29] stranger and you took me in naked and
[1:29:31] you clothed me I was sick and you
[1:29:32] visited me I was in prison and you came
[1:29:34] unto me then shall the righteous answer
[1:29:37] him saying Lord when saw we thee a
[1:29:40] hunger and fed thee or thirsty and gave
[1:29:42] thee drink when saw we thee a stranger
[1:29:45] and took thee in or naked and clothed
[1:29:47] thee or when saw we thee sick or in
[1:29:51] prison and came unto thee and the King
[1:29:53] sh shall answer and say unto them verily
[1:29:55] I say unto you in as much as you have
[1:29:57] done it unto the least of these my
[1:29:58] little ones my brethren you have done it
[1:30:00] unto me then shall he say also unto them
[1:30:03] on the left hand depart from me you
[1:30:04] curse into Everlasting fire prepared for
[1:30:07] the devil and his angels for I was a
[1:30:09] hungered and you gave me no meat I was
[1:30:11] thirsty and you gave me no drink I was a
[1:30:15] stranger and you took me not in naked
[1:30:18] and you clothed me not sick and in
[1:30:19] prison and you visited me not then shall
[1:30:22] they also answer saying Lord when saw we
[1:30:24] thee a hunger or a thirst or a stranger
[1:30:26] or naked or sick or in prison and did
[1:30:28] not Minister unto thee then shall he
[1:30:30] answer them saying verily I say unto you
[1:30:32] and as much as you did it not to one of
[1:30:34] the least of these you did it not to me
[1:30:37] and these shall go away into Everlasting
[1:30:39] punishment but the righteous into
[1:30:43] eternal life what you're seeing here is
[1:30:46] the great white Throne
[1:30:47] judgment we see God passing judgment
[1:30:50] here based on works
[1:30:54] just like it says in Revelation 20
[1:30:56] Revelation 20 he said and the dead were
[1:30:58] judged out of those things which were
[1:31:01] written in the books according to their
[1:31:04] works we see both righteous and
[1:31:07] unrighteous at this
[1:31:10] judgment but like I said this group of
[1:31:12] righteous is not the
[1:31:14] bride this is this is not the bride the
[1:31:16] bride doesn't stand before the Judgment
[1:31:18] Throne the bride is sitting with him in
[1:31:20] the throne 1 Corinthians 6 says do you
[1:31:22] not know that the Saints shall judge
[1:31:23] judge the world Revelation 3:21 to him
[1:31:26] that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[1:31:28] me in my Throne so these righteous are
[1:31:31] not the
[1:31:32] bride he says the question now arises
[1:31:35] why are these righteous ones in
[1:31:37] judgment he said there's no other place
[1:31:39] that they can come
[1:31:41] up he says for there are but two
[1:31:44] resurrections and since they could not
[1:31:46] qualify for the first resurrection they
[1:31:48] must come up in the second which is a
[1:31:50] resurrection unto judgment why why
[1:31:53] didn't they qualify for the first
[1:31:55] resurrection they weren't born
[1:31:58] again they didn't have the token they
[1:32:01] didn't have o you know you know the
[1:32:03] parable they're the five foolish
[1:32:07] virgins they don't have any o they
[1:32:09] didn't have the Holy Ghost they weren't
[1:32:11] bride and so they couldn't come up in
[1:32:12] the first resurrection therefore they
[1:32:14] had to come up into
[1:32:16] judgment they come up not having eternal
[1:32:19] life but they
[1:32:21] receive eternal life
[1:32:25] and how is it they are receiving life on
[1:32:28] how they
[1:32:29] treated the
[1:32:31] bride they're receiving life on that
[1:32:34] that that they helped you and they cared
[1:32:36] for you and they were kind to you
[1:32:38] brother Brown says they are not his
[1:32:41] Brethren talking about Jesus they're not
[1:32:43] his
[1:32:44] Brethren he says that would make them
[1:32:46] join HS with Jesus they're not heirs to
[1:32:48] anything but
[1:32:51] life they share No throne with him their
[1:32:55] names must have been in the Book of Life
[1:32:58] and not
[1:33:00] removed now because of their love of the
[1:33:03] people of God they are recognized and
[1:33:06] saved no doubt these served and helped
[1:33:08] the children of God perhaps like
[1:33:10] Nicodemus and Gia they stood for the
[1:33:13] children in a time of trouble he said
[1:33:15] the names of many of these many of those
[1:33:18] destroyed were in The Book of Life also
[1:33:21] but they were blotted out because they
[1:33:23] failed to honor the people of God who
[1:33:26] were the Living manifested Word living
[1:33:30] Epistles for their day listen I don't
[1:33:33] mean to make this a Sunday school lesson
[1:33:34] but it matters how we treat people if
[1:33:37] there's literally people getting in
[1:33:39] heaven and people's names being blotted
[1:33:40] out of heaven based off how they treated
[1:33:42] people and don't think you're going to
[1:33:45] be excused for how you treat people just
[1:33:47] because you go to church with them this
[1:33:49] ain't just an out there
[1:33:52] problem God cares how we treat one
[1:33:56] another it matters to
[1:33:59] him I've said it a bunch of times here
[1:34:01] and I'll say it again we're not all
[1:34:02] going to be best friends not everybody's
[1:34:04] coming to everybody's birthday party
[1:34:06] that just ain't how life works it's not
[1:34:08] possible but you should treat everyone
[1:34:10] with the same kindness and love and
[1:34:12] respect do a child of God you know how
[1:34:17] you feel when someone mistreats your
[1:34:19] child even if it's another one of your
[1:34:22] children that does it
[1:34:26] doesn't matter as one of your children
[1:34:28] it makes you just as angry that's how
[1:34:30] God feels but way way way way worse
[1:34:34] because he died for that
[1:34:37] child it matters how we treat
[1:34:40] people he cares how we treat one
[1:34:43] another these are granted life it is
[1:34:47] this second resurrection that the
[1:34:48] foolish virgin comes up they do not have
[1:34:51] the Holy Ghost so they miss being in the
[1:34:53] bride but they are a separated people
[1:34:55] they're are a god-loving people they're
[1:34:57] trying to abide by his word to the best
[1:34:59] they know and they are a help to the
[1:35:01] work of the Lord all of these people had
[1:35:04] their names in The Book of Life and
[1:35:06] their names remained listen I say we
[1:35:10] serve a God full of grace and a God full
[1:35:12] of Mercy not even born again they're not
[1:35:14] his Brethren but he grants to them
[1:35:16] eternal life listen I'll say it again
[1:35:19] it's not a bad
[1:35:21] deal well they don't get to come into
[1:35:23] the city no that's what you get but they
[1:35:25] get to avoid hell and they get eternal
[1:35:28] life in
[1:35:29] heaven that's a God full of grace a God
[1:35:33] full of Mercy he says they will come up
[1:35:36] in the second resurrection and go into
[1:35:39] eternal
[1:35:41] life so there are those whose names were
[1:35:43] written and taken off there are those
[1:35:46] whose names were written and their names
[1:35:48] remained as they were granted
[1:35:51] life and then and I'm not going to spend
[1:35:53] much time on this one there are those
[1:35:55] whose names were never written at
[1:35:59] all names that have never been or ever
[1:36:02] will be written on the
[1:36:04] books Revelation 178 says the Beast that
[1:36:07] thou sawest was now remember when were
[1:36:10] names written on the book of life before
[1:36:13] the foundation of the world and shall
[1:36:15] Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go
[1:36:17] into predition and they that dwell on
[1:36:19] the Earth shall wonder whose names were
[1:36:22] not
[1:36:25] written in the Book of Life from the
[1:36:28] foundation of the world when they beheld
[1:36:30] the Beast that was and is not and yet is
[1:36:34] brother brandham says these were
[1:36:35] ordained of God but not unto election
[1:36:38] and with this group is such that are as
[1:36:41] Pharaoh because it says of him even for
[1:36:43] this same purpose have I raised thee up
[1:36:46] vessels of Wrath fitted for
[1:36:52] Destruction it says him even for the
[1:36:55] same purpose have I raised thee up
[1:36:57] vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction
[1:36:59] Romans 9:17 and22 none of these would be
[1:37:03] placed on the records of life I'm not
[1:37:05] saying that there's no record of them
[1:37:07] this is Brother Brown no doubt there's
[1:37:09] some kind of record of them but not in
[1:37:11] the records of
[1:37:14] life now remember what we said at the
[1:37:17] beginning God is
[1:37:18] omniscient and he knows all and his ways
[1:37:20] are above our ways if he's omnicient
[1:37:23] then and he's perfect in his wisdom and
[1:37:24] he's perfect in his
[1:37:26] righteousness it it it's hard to
[1:37:29] understand this but brother Bram tells
[1:37:31] us since the portion of the word is hard
[1:37:33] for the human mind to grasp it must be
[1:37:36] accepted and believed by faith therefore
[1:37:39] as Paul says if God should take one lump
[1:37:41] of clay and make of that same lump one
[1:37:44] vessel under honor and another vessel
[1:37:46] under dishonor who can be offended and
[1:37:49] cry against him and if there are those
[1:37:51] who names were never placed on a record
[1:37:54] of life we must accept that also and if
[1:37:56] there are those who will enter into life
[1:37:58] eternal after the white Throne judgment
[1:38:01] solely on the grounds of being good and
[1:38:03] kind or just to the elect of God who are
[1:38:06] his Brethren then we cannot but accept
[1:38:08] that for who knoweth the mind of the
[1:38:11] Lord that he should instruct
[1:38:14] him and we get to the close of this
[1:38:17] chapter and brother brandham begins to
[1:38:20] use the analogy of the wheat
[1:38:22] plant he about how the seed goes down
[1:38:24] into the ground so that a single grain
[1:38:27] will reproduce itself over a period of
[1:38:30] time into much more than a single grain
[1:38:33] but into a
[1:38:34] multitude that seed dies but the life
[1:38:37] that was in it will come up in the
[1:38:40] plant and that plant no now pay close
[1:38:42] attention is not the reproduction of the
[1:38:45] grain but it is the carrier of the life
[1:38:49] of that grain which at some point is
[1:38:52] going to come back to the the original
[1:38:54] form but in a multiplied form so now
[1:38:57] we're we're we're starting to get to the
[1:38:59] last group to the group whose names were
[1:39:01] always on the book and can never be
[1:39:03] taken off the names in the Eternal
[1:39:06] section of the book so Christ The Royal
[1:39:08] SE died so that his very life would be
[1:39:11] produced in other bodies but as it comes
[1:39:15] up the blade isn't the
[1:39:18] wheat the tosel isn't the wheat it was a
[1:39:21] carrier of the life but it is not the
[1:39:23] wheat John even says of the wheat what's
[1:39:26] he say he says in Matthew 3:12 he says
[1:39:29] whose fan is in his hand and he will
[1:39:31] thoroughly Purge his floor and gather
[1:39:34] his wheat into the Garner that's the
[1:39:36] Rapture the wheat is gathered but he
[1:39:39] will burn the chaff with unquenchable
[1:39:41] fire the chaff was part of the
[1:39:44] plant the chaff protected the
[1:39:48] seed the chaff was part of the church
[1:39:53] but it never was
[1:39:55] wheat it was only a carrier of the life
[1:39:59] he's going to take the wheat the grain
[1:40:01] the ones that that have his same life
[1:40:03] those are bone of his bone he's going to
[1:40:05] take them into the Garner that's Harvest
[1:40:07] Time that's where we're at it's going
[1:40:10] home
[1:40:11] time who who who are these people these
[1:40:13] are ones whose name were always on the
[1:40:15] book they always was wheat they always
[1:40:18] was a part of him they were elected to
[1:40:21] eternal life and they're gathered
[1:40:22] together but the chaff is burned what's
[1:40:25] that mean in terms of tonight's sermon
[1:40:27] blotted
[1:40:29] out stages of the week and we're
[1:40:32] bringing this
[1:40:33] down you have the blade the stalk the
[1:40:36] husk the tassel the
[1:40:38] chaff these are the stages of the church
[1:40:41] brother brandham calls the stages of the
[1:40:42] wheat plant the record of the book of
[1:40:45] life as the church comes forth Through
[1:40:47] the
[1:40:48] Ages he says Jesus Christ died and gave
[1:40:51] his life that life was to come back upon
[1:40:54] the church and bring many sons like him
[1:40:55] to himself unto glory in the
[1:40:57] resurrection but as the wheat seed had
[1:41:00] to have a carrier to bring forth
[1:41:03] multiplied wheat seed even so there had
[1:41:06] to be a church which would be a
[1:41:08] carrier of the Life of
[1:41:12] Christ so think about it just part of
[1:41:16] that plant just part of it can go back
[1:41:19] to being the seed because just part of
[1:41:22] that wheat plant is eternal life wheat
[1:41:26] only a part of it and the church has
[1:41:28] been carrying the life down Through the
[1:41:30] Ages and all the church and although the
[1:41:32] church was not the Original Seed the
[1:41:35] life of that seed was being carried
[1:41:38] through he uses Israel as an example
[1:41:41] Israel came out two million strong and
[1:41:44] yet they were never going to possess the
[1:41:46] land they were literally carriers of the
[1:41:49] life what do I mean by that it was their
[1:41:52] children
[1:41:53] who was going to possess the land they
[1:41:55] were carrying the life of the ones that
[1:41:58] would cross
[1:42:00] over they were just carriers the ones
[1:42:03] that came after them were going to
[1:42:04] possess the promised land what happened
[1:42:06] to them we're back to it they stopped
[1:42:10] short they didn't go they didn't take
[1:42:12] the land because God didn't let them
[1:42:14] they didn't take the land because they
[1:42:16] chose to rebel against God they said
[1:42:18] let's make captains and go back we can't
[1:42:20] take the land I'm telling you there's a
[1:42:23] people here that can take the land
[1:42:25] there's a people who aren't just
[1:42:26] carriers of the life but they are a
[1:42:28] reproduction of that life on the earth
[1:42:31] once again and they're here to take the
[1:42:34] land most of them had their names
[1:42:36] blotted out and the same in the church
[1:42:39] world
[1:42:40] today names are being blotted
[1:42:44] out but there is an eternal
[1:42:48] section there are those whose names have
[1:42:50] been there before the foundation of the
[1:42:52] world
[1:42:53] and they shall always remain and those
[1:42:56] are the names of those that were in him
[1:42:58] they are part of him they were in his
[1:43:01] thinking they are his attributes and not
[1:43:04] one shall I say it and not one of our
[1:43:07] names is going to be blotted out of the
[1:43:10] Eternal section of the Lamb's Book of
[1:43:13] Life we're not carriers We Are The
[1:43:15] Original Seed we are what went into the
[1:43:18] ground it's up again it's harvest time
[1:43:21] and the life of Christ is now upon the
[1:43:22] Earth again in a multi- membered body
[1:43:26] the original life chosen in him before
[1:43:29] the world began she is in him she is in
[1:43:32] his throne and she can never be judged
[1:43:36] oh Hallelujah I'm thankful I'm not going
[1:43:38] to stand before that judgment I'm
[1:43:40] thankful that I'm letting the word of
[1:43:41] God judge me now and I'm saying Lord
[1:43:43] mold me now Lord change me now Lord make
[1:43:46] sure that on that day I'm sitting with
[1:43:48] you in your throne and not standing in
[1:43:50] front of your throne that I will be
[1:43:51] accounted worthy to walk in white a robe
[1:43:54] that's washed white by the blood of the
[1:43:56] Lord Jesus Christ the worthy one and
[1:43:59] he's going to look at us and say you're
[1:44:00] worthy you're worthy you're worthy your
[1:44:04] name was always there and I'm going to
[1:44:06] stand now you identified yourself with
[1:44:08] me on Earth and now I'm going to
[1:44:10] identify myself with you in front of my
[1:44:12] father and all the Holy Angels come
[1:44:15] forth into eternal life your name was
[1:44:20] always on the Book of Life
[1:44:25] We Can't Stop short evening like
[1:44:27] Tabernacle but we will reproduce the
[1:44:30] fullness of the life of the Original
[1:44:33] Seed in a multi-member bride body and
[1:44:38] reproduce Christ upon the Earth and when
[1:44:41] the role is Called Up
[1:44:44] Yonder out of that Eternal section where
[1:44:46] no name can be struck off we're going to
[1:44:49] hear our name called father they stood
[1:44:52] for me
[1:44:54] father when all hell was against them
[1:44:55] they wouldn't back down they confessed
[1:44:58] my name and now I'm going to confess
[1:45:01] theirs musicians you can
[1:45:04] come says brother Brown says first of
[1:45:06] all we know most assuredly that the
[1:45:09] purpose of God stands in
[1:45:11] election it was purposed in himself it
[1:45:14] was God's purpose to bring forth a
[1:45:16] people like unto him that would be a
[1:45:18] word bride she was chosen before the
[1:45:21] foundation of the world in him she was
[1:45:23] forn and beloved before she was ever
[1:45:25] brought forth during the ages upon the
[1:45:27] Earth she was Redeemed by his blood and
[1:45:30] can never come into condemnation she can
[1:45:33] never be in the Judgment because sin
[1:45:35] cannot be imputed unto her Romans 4:8
[1:45:38] blessed is the man to whom the Lord will
[1:45:39] not impute sin but indeed she shall be
[1:45:42] with him in his throne of judgment
[1:45:44] judging the world and even angels her
[1:45:46] name each of her members was written in
[1:45:50] a section of the Lamb's Book of Life but
[1:45:53] before the
[1:45:54] foundation of the
[1:45:56] world he wraps It Up by saying this if
[1:45:59] he was faithful and true to those of the
[1:46:01] sardan age then he is just as true to
[1:46:05] this our age if they by his grace and
[1:46:09] power will be received and commended by
[1:46:11] him then so will we let us go therefore
