[19:10] healed of the cancer
[19:11] the brother got a job a great job that
[19:14] he was able to have a
[19:15] sustainable wage for his family god
[19:18] is a neat supplier he's a faithful god
[19:22] sister karen i just left her a few
[19:24] moments ago in the hospital and
[19:26] she said to tell you thank you for
[19:27] praying for her she knows you're doing
[19:29] it
[19:30] amen so god bless you as she recovers
[19:33] and we believe we lay hands on the sick
[19:36] and
[19:36] they shall recover amen we just heard
[19:39] the word confirmed again
[19:41] that david went down to ziglag and found
[19:44] it burnt
[19:45] and he inquired of the lord and he said
[19:47] pursue it
[19:48] you're going to recover all amen he got
[19:51] his wife

[20:25] jehovah god
[20:27] who heals all diseases or she's been in
[20:30] the hospital but doctors can't heal
[20:33] lord medicine can't do the healing so if
[20:36] healing is going to be done god's going
[20:37] to do it
[20:38] even if he uses maybe the
[20:40] instrumentality of man is still god that
[20:42] heals
[20:44] father we're asking in the name of jesus
[20:46] the miraculous power of god
[20:49] will go forth as we lay our hands lord

[42:16] amen that was some wonderful worship
[42:19] giving god glory amen you know it's easy
[42:21] to worship him on the mountains
[42:23] but it's when you're in the valley
[42:25] that's where true worship comes amen
[42:27] you know today we we have this whatsapp
[42:30] you know with the musicians and
[42:32] songs started coming in specials and you
[42:34] just tell people it was
[42:36] had a heart for worship and and you know
[42:38] the thought came to me about
[42:40] you know their jehoshaphat you know the
[42:42] word spoken said just get you some
[42:44] worshippers and start worshiping me and
[42:46] while you're worshiping me
[42:47] i'll fight your battles and so i went to
[42:50] open up my
[42:51] my bible app to actually take a little
[42:53] bit out of there and post it in there
[42:55] and
[42:55] and on the front there the scripture of
[42:57] the day was psalms 32 verse 7.
[43:00] it says thou art my hiding place thou
[43:03] shalt preserve me from
[43:04] trouble thou shalt compass me about
[43:07] with songs of deliverance salah
[43:12] say law means to pause and calmly think
[43:15] about that
[43:16] amen i'd like to think about that for a
[43:18] moment because he has the answer for
[43:20] every situation
[43:21] that we're in we'll let you be seated
[43:23] for a moment amen is not something i
[43:25] normally
[43:26] do but i usually like to try to get
[43:28] right into the word because
[43:29] i'm not much of a talker as far as in
[43:31] front of people but
[43:32] amen but i love to i love to have the
[43:35] anointing to preach amen because under
[43:37] the anointing
[43:38] all the where the weird feelings and
[43:40] funny feelings leave
[43:42] but you know i just wanted to take a
[43:43] moment and and just tell you about the
[43:46] last couple of weeks because we've been
[43:47] away from home and
[43:49] and we took a little trip there uh to to
[43:52] do some ministering and
[43:53] and also as a moment to celebrate me and
[43:56] sister ruth's
[43:57] 25th anniversary it's hard to believe
[44:00] that we've come to that milestone but
[44:02] here we are and we're very thankful that
[44:05] god has brought us to this place
[44:07] and we're looking for many more years to
[44:09] come however long time will tear it
[44:11] but you know we had a wonderful trip it
[44:13] was a supernatural trip
[44:15] we had a weekend of meetings at brother
[44:17] ron's and then a weekend y'all can be
[44:19] seated we're
[44:20] we had a weekend of meetings ministering
[44:22] there afterwards for brother josh
[44:24] bennett
[44:25] with brother wayne lawson and in between
[44:28] was able to take a couple of days and
[44:31] celebrate our anniversary but i didn't
[44:34] go
[44:34] just to go i went commissioned and
[44:38] fought through obstacles demonic attacks
[44:42] mind battles spirits of oppression
[44:45] attacks against my own family
[44:47] even against my own mother you know the
[44:49] day that we would actually get on the
[44:50] plane to leave she was being checked
[44:52] into the hospital
[44:53] and it was telling us that she would
[44:55] have a she was found that she had some
[44:57] type of growth or mass in her heart
[45:00] and so i didn't know if she would be
[45:01] going into surgery i didn't know
[45:03] what was about to happen but you know i
[45:05] just had really felt
[45:06] impressed to continue on in in in the
[45:09] direction that i felt god had directed
[45:11] me to be
[45:12] in and so uh you know i i
[45:15] came to the continued as we pressed on
[45:19] through all of that and i'll tell you
[45:20] it's not an easy place to be
[45:22] because the the devil yeah the devil
[45:24] likes to come and he likes to torment
[45:26] you in your mind you know you get on a
[45:28] plane and
[45:28] you don't have text and you don't have
[45:30] messaging for some time
[45:32] so he likes to come and torment you but
[45:34] we found that she would go there and
[45:36] they would find that there was no mass
[45:38] there was nothing there and so we thank
[45:40] the lord for that
[45:42] and so we but you know as we would meet
[45:44] up with the
[45:45] spencer family on friday and you know
[45:48] the spencer and prut family has been
[45:50] very close
[45:51] through the years we've been brought
[45:52] together through the fire of
[45:54] adversity and you know i went there to
[45:58] try to encourage because i knew it was
[46:00] right out of the year
[46:01] that he had he had felt directed to come
[46:03] here amen to be prayed for and
[46:07] and so you know i thought it was it's
[46:08] quite interesting that here we are at a
[46:10] year
[46:11] and my mother is back in the hospital
[46:13] again with the same condition or another
[46:15] attack of the enemy
[46:17] and you know but i i i want to say that
[46:20] i appreciate you as a congregation that
[46:23] have been standing in faith with us
[46:25] and and sending all the text and and the
[46:28] encouragement and you know and also
[46:30] creating an atmosphere
[46:32] that healings can take place and
[46:34] deliverances can take place in the house
[46:36] of god
[46:37] you know but i'd like to share just a
[46:38] few things from from brother tim
[46:41] as he would write down when he would go
[46:43] to brother ron's at the beginning of his
[46:45] diagnosis
[46:46] and uh he would be there to meet him on
[46:49] kind of a surprise trip because brother
[46:51] ron
[46:52] had had just found out you know what was
[46:54] going on in his body
[46:56] and you know all the things that were
[46:57] taking place and
[46:59] and you know brother tim would write
[47:01] that it was a very emotional time as
[47:03] they would meet there in the airport
[47:05] brother ron would sob and
[47:07] weep on his shoulder he said it was like
[47:09] we were alone a hundred people walking
[47:11] by we were
[47:12] oblivious to anyone around he had prayed
[47:15] that morning
[47:16] saying god i need a boost we went from
[47:19] there to his home to where brother
[47:20] donnie and sister carol
[47:22] reagan was waiting inside brother ron
[47:24] was not to
[47:25] was not going to wait for another day to
[47:27] pray he wanted prayer right then
[47:29] he was unlike pharaoh who wanted one
[47:31] more night with the frogs
[47:33] so brother don and i began talking of
[47:35] divine healing and deliverances and how
[47:37] god
[47:38] has delivered others who were dying by
[47:40] the gary stanky brother ron himself when
[47:42] he was dying from the burns
[47:44] and that it was the will of god to be
[47:46] healed and the ladies were in the
[47:48] joining room and they came in as we were
[47:50] about to pray and the holy spirit
[47:52] fell down among us and anointed us we
[47:54] prayed and cursed that demon of cancer
[47:56] and for his immune system
[47:58] to be activated to seek and destroy that
[48:01] cancer
[48:02] for the dawn he began to intercede in
[48:03] the spirit as tongues from the heavenly
[48:05] language have been to
[48:06] begin to flow from his mouth we were
[48:09] charged by the holy ghost and demanded
[48:11] that evil spirit of cancer to leave his
[48:13] body
[48:14] it was a powerful and anointing moment
[48:16] brother tim would go and he'd preach
[48:18] that on saturday night on who hath
[48:20] believed our report
[48:22] and sunday night on our redemptive
[48:24] rights and you know at that time was
[48:26] also me and brother tim or the george
[48:28] winters brother ron was actually
[48:29] had tickets to go to japan and to
[48:33] minister in japan
[48:34] and then from japan over to the
[48:36] philippines to minister there and
[48:38] and um cove had started hitting you know
[48:40] that all the things had taken place
[48:41] brother ron's diagnosis
[48:43] and so uh we had to you know put that
[48:46] aside for the moment but
[48:47] while he's ministering there's a lady
[48:49] that had been in a in a school and she'd
[48:52] been witness into this japanese
[48:54] professor and she he'd had a lot of
[48:56] questions you know how can god do the
[48:58] things that he's
[48:58] that the bible says he's done when it's
[49:01] it's uh you know
[49:02] scientifically impossible for it to
[49:04] happen
[49:05] you know it has to be you know he's
[49:06] taking her to tell her it had to be
[49:08] scientifically proved
[49:10] and so she began to talk about different
[49:12] things and and talked about knowing the
[49:13] art regardless of scientific proof it
[49:16] rained
[49:17] and you know examples of joshua and the
[49:19] sun standing still and
[49:21] so she just told him to check out a
[49:23] youtube link and
[49:24] and you know if he was interested
[49:26] brother tim would be ministering at this
[49:27] church
[49:28] so he decided to check it out and he
[49:30] began to hear the same things be
[49:32] repeated back to him as
[49:33] brother tim would comment about joshua
[49:36] and the son standing still and
[49:38] he shared that he was so overwhelmed by
[49:40] a presence
[49:41] that fell in his room he immediately
[49:44] gave his heart to the lord
[49:46] and he said and he was thankful that the
[49:47] lord understood him as he had never
[49:49] prayed
[49:50] and he asked me he asked the sister what
[49:52] shall i do next and he said
[49:54] she said be baptized in the name of the
[49:56] lord jesus christ
[49:58] and and god has done some wonderful
[50:00] things right there and
[50:02] you know even as we were supposed to be
[50:03] ministering or felt like we
[50:05] to go to japan amen even though that
[50:08] didn't work out in that way it was a
[50:09] different way than we expected god
[50:11] still was saving some japanese people
[50:15] amen it's amazing and then you know as
[50:17] we would have to cancel the flights and
[50:19] all the things that
[50:20] delta said well you just have to wait a
[50:22] year you got a year to use it and i
[50:24] would call and they'd say well
[50:25] you got to do this and you got to do
[50:27] that and there's really no way we can
[50:28] just refund your money and
[50:30] all this and one morning i woke up and i
[50:32] felt impressed to call them and i called
[50:34] him
[50:34] got this lady on the phone and i began
[50:36] to talk to her and tell her what had
[50:37] taken place
[50:39] and i told her that our one of our
[50:40] friends brother ron that was traveling
[50:41] with us had
[50:42] had been diagnosed with cancer and she
[50:44] said oh my god
[50:46] she said i'm a cancer survivor i'll get
[50:49] you your money back
[50:51] and in just a few moments all of that
[50:53] twelve thousand dollars worth of tickets
[50:55] were being refunded just like that
[50:57] and he meant god intervening on our
[50:59] behalf
[51:01] but brother tim would write this he said
[51:03] since hearing the news on brother ron
[51:04] i've been praying earnestly for a
[51:06] visitation from the lord
[51:08] via dream or a vision or his voice or
[51:10] any way he wanted
[51:12] i felt like i was like joshua looking at
[51:14] walls of jericho trying to find a way to
[51:16] get through the big walls
[51:18] in order to conquer the enemy but on
[51:21] sunday night i had a very vivid dream i
[51:23] saw
[51:23] young but mature buzzards that had left
[51:26] the nest but had not learned to fly
[51:28] they were about 12 and i was feeding
[51:30] them to pigs
[51:31] monday i had a day of fellowship and
[51:33] preached all day to brother ron about
[51:35] the promises of healing
[51:36] on tuesday morning we were going to with
[51:38] him to the hospital to find the news of
[51:40] treatment and plans
[51:42] and then we were to fly out and for home
[51:44] at 2 40 in the afternoon
[51:46] in the middle of night i had an
[51:47] experience of waking up that i thought
[51:49] that i heard and was singing the song
[51:51] we shall see miracles when i got up for
[51:54] the coffee i was greeted by sister
[51:56] connie and i poured the water
[51:58] as i poured the water into the coffee
[51:59] pot she asked how our night was and i
[52:02] said find
[52:03] fine it was fine and if any if it's any
[52:05] consolation to you
[52:06] i woke up during the night singing the
[52:08] songs we shall see miracles
[52:11] she began crying and said brother tim
[52:13] brother ron couldn't sleep
[52:15] and i woke up at 2 30 and was singing
[52:17] the song
[52:18] we shall see miracles and i have to say
[52:21] we have saw miracles
[52:23] just here this last easter we saw a man
[52:25] that was supposed to been dead a long
[52:27] time ago
[52:28] minister under the power of the holy
[52:30] ghost and if you hadn't been watching
[52:31] his services
[52:32] amen you wouldn't think that a man would
[52:34] have lung cancer and brain cancer
[52:36] he end up whining and carrying on about
[52:38] how bad his day is
[52:40] he's up firing cannons
[52:43] amen and it's very encouraging if you
[52:45] need brother
[52:47] brother brother ben davis i saw him this
[52:48] past weekend and he said you know if
[52:50] there's ever a day i'm down in the dumps
[52:52] i go turn on one of his sermons and by
[52:54] the time that's in that sermon
[52:55] i'm walking out of there with my head up
[52:57] high thinking i got nothing to complain
[53:00] about
[53:01] amen so but on the way to the doctor
[53:03] they would to discuss this cancer
[53:05] and plans uh brother brother tim would
[53:07] remember his dream and it came to me
[53:09] that
[53:10] brother branham told that the buzzards
[53:11] represented cancers
[53:13] in disease and affliction the cancer in
[53:15] the spiritual he's a devil
[53:17] he's the type of a scavenger in a
[53:19] buzzard and eats dead things
[53:21] but i was puzzled by what pigs meant i
[53:24] scanned through over 150 quotes on pigs
[53:27] and couldn't find a clue in the sermon
[53:29] but when the doctor was talking about
[53:31] treatment using
[53:32] immunotherapy i did an internet search
[53:35] on cancer
[53:36] and this immunotherapy and pigs and
[53:39] found that they developed it using small
[53:41] pig just like
[53:42] i saw in the dream there were about 12
[53:44] of them as i fed them to the pigs
[53:46] one by one i could see them chewing them
[53:49] up ripping apart the guts
[53:51] of the buzzards it would be last year as
[53:54] we said brother ron would feel to come
[53:55] to louisiana to be prayed for
[53:58] i spoke to him on the phone that week
[54:00] prior to his coming and he'd say now
[54:02] you watch satan's going to try to block
[54:05] it
[54:06] in just a few days my mom sister karen
[54:08] would have her third brain bleed
[54:11] it would be where she would need surgery
[54:12] doctors gave us no hope
[54:14] and we felt but we felt for brother ron
[54:16] to come anyways and god
[54:18] met us in a cabin and three boys my two
[54:22] sons and brother adam would have an
[54:23] experience with god
[54:25] brother ron would receive supernatural
[54:27] strength
[54:28] from that moment he never missed another
[54:31] day of work
[54:32] before that he didn't have the strength
[54:34] harder to get out and walk out of his
[54:35] bedroom
[54:36] but after that moment every day since
[54:39] that time a year later he's not missed a
[54:40] day of work
[54:42] he goes to work with his boys and things
[54:44] and and so
[54:45] and so but now a year later satan has
[54:48] tried to block a visitation again
[54:51] my mom you know has begun again being
[54:53] attacked by
[54:54] confusion and memory loss and now even a
[54:57] fourth brain bleed
[54:58] but our god is awesome amen our god is
[55:02] awesome you know as i would talk
[55:04] with brother tim about this the trip
[55:06] that i was to go on and
[55:07] you know we felt that we had come to a
[55:09] spot like the red sea
[55:12] will we back up from the promises of god
[55:14] or will we speak and go
[55:16] forward and so we spoke and we went
[55:19] forward and we walked by faith and not
[55:21] by sight
[55:22] you know as i would land there in
[55:23] virginia brother tim would call me and
[55:25] he talked to me and said son
[55:26] we've been together in many things we've
[55:28] begun we've been together in the church
[55:30] the ministry
[55:31] you've helped me on the farm you know we
[55:33] had goats you helped me sell them when
[55:35] the time has come
[55:37] when we had cows you helped me find
[55:38] buyers and sold them for me
[55:40] he said now i'm commissioning to go sell
[55:42] some pigs
[55:45] the last buzzards have been fed it's
[55:47] time to sell the pigs
[55:48] we don't need them anymore and i'm here
[55:51] to testify we went and sold pigs
[55:54] amen i believe god's a healer i believe
[55:57] god has come on the scene for our
[55:59] brother and i believe
[56:00] that he's going to go into full health
[56:02] that's what i believe i know you can
[56:04] anybody can question what they want to
[56:06] question but i saw god man
[56:08] manifest among us and i believe he's
[56:11] going to do what he said he's going to
[56:12] do
[56:14] amen and so that's where i've been so we
[56:16] would go from there
[56:17] we'd go to uh brother josh bennett's and
[56:20] we'd have some wonderful services there
[56:23] to where the presence of god would just
[56:24] come down in our midst
[56:26] and i believe he's the same god tonight
[56:29] amen let's stand together as we read our
[56:31] scripture
[56:40] hebrews 13 and verse 8 and also first
[56:42] kings 18
[56:44] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[56:48] and forever also first kings 18 and
[56:52] verse 36
[56:53] and it came to pass at the time of the
[56:55] offering of the evening sacrifice
[56:58] that elijah the prophet came near and
[57:00] said lord god of abraham
[57:02] isaac and of israel
[57:05] let it be known this day that thou art
[57:07] god in israel
[57:09] that i am thy servant and that i have
[57:11] done all these things as thy word
[57:15] hear me o lord hear me that this people
[57:18] may know
[57:19] that thou art the lord god and that thou
[57:21] has turned their heart back again
[57:24] then the fire of the lord fell and
[57:27] consumed the burnt sacrifice
[57:29] and the wood and the stones and the dust
[57:32] and licked up the water that was in the
[57:34] trench
[57:35] and when all the people saw it they fell
[57:37] on their faces
[57:38] and they said the lord he is the god
[57:42] the lord he is the god is that your
[57:45] testimony tonight
[57:47] god is god amen we let you be seated
[57:50] you know before i left the wednesday
[57:52] night before i spoke on the god that
[57:54] answers
[57:56] tonight i would like to speak to you
[57:57] tonight we have the answer
[58:00] we have the answer you know as we would
[58:03] look at
[58:04] that thought on the god that answers we
[58:07] would find here
[58:08] that elijah would bring these people
[58:10] before as a showdown
[58:12] to mount carmel and he would bring them
[58:13] because there was some that was serving
[58:15] many that was serving baal and a god
[58:18] that was
[58:19] not alive of course and a dead god but
[58:22] they would they would you know
[58:23] know the story of how he would set up
[58:24] the all they would he'd tell them to do
[58:26] the set up the altar put the sacrifice
[58:28] there
[58:28] and said let the god who answers by fire
[58:31] let him be god
[58:33] amen the goddess answers and and but you
[58:35] know what his challenge would have been
[58:37] no good if god wouldn't have answered
[58:39] but god answered and god came on the
[58:41] scene as as we've seen this as
[58:44] as he would come and he would set it all
[58:45] together and put it all back in place
[58:47] and
[58:48] put all the loose ends together and
[58:50] bring back the
[58:51] the altar to his position and his place
[58:54] and
[58:54] and then ask god to move and and god
[58:57] moved on his behalf
[58:59] see god always answers he always answers
[59:02] jesus would say
[59:03] ask and you shall receive seek and you
[59:06] shall find
[59:07] anyone that asks will receive anyone
[59:09] that seeks shall find
[59:11] anyone that knocks it will be open unto
[59:13] him that's the only way that i found if
[59:16] i get was to get anything from
[59:18] god is to take him at his word and
[59:20] believe it no matter which way he sends
[59:22] it
[59:23] god will answer amen god sometimes will
[59:26] meet you in an unexpected way
[59:29] in an unexpected time in an unexpected
[59:31] place as we
[59:32] as we talked about how he did with moses
[59:34] moses it was an unexpected moment for
[59:37] moses he was out there on the backside
[59:38] of a desert
[59:40] he was out there minding his own
[59:41] business tented some sheep and all of a
[59:43] sudden he noticed a bush that was on
[59:45] fire
[59:46] and it was not burned and he said i'm
[59:47] going to go see what god
[59:49] what is happening here and so he'd walk
[59:51] to this place and a voice would speak
[59:53] out of that bush
[59:54] and would call him by name and he would
[59:55] recognize it this is god
[59:58] god is ministering unto me god is
[1:00:00] speaking unto me
[1:00:01] and brother branham would say that he
[1:00:02] said he met him at an unexpected age
[1:00:05] and an unexpected place and an
[1:00:07] unexpected way god didn't meet moses the
[1:00:10] way he usually meets men
[1:00:11] but he met him in an unusual way that's
[1:00:14] the way sometimes he answers our prayer
[1:00:16] in the way that he thinks is best
[1:00:20] in the way in his way is always right
[1:00:22] and if we just
[1:00:23] ask anything and it doesn't happen don't
[1:00:26] let that make you
[1:00:27] lose or lose faith or fall back but
[1:00:30] let's ask
[1:00:30] god and stand firm on his word and say
[1:00:33] it's true
[1:00:34] no matter how dark it is no matter how
[1:00:36] troublesome it looks
[1:00:38] no matter how possible it be god's word
[1:00:41] is true amen
[1:00:42] now the word now the answer may come in
[1:00:44] a disguised manner in a way that you
[1:00:46] know in other words in a way that you're
[1:00:48] not expecting
[1:00:49] or a way that in a way that's so
[1:00:51] different from what you
[1:00:52] was thinking it would come but god will
[1:00:54] answer you god will
[1:00:56] come on the scene god will answer his
[1:00:58] word god will fulfill his word
[1:01:00] you know that's how god answers the
[1:01:02] promises he answers them
[1:01:04] by fulfilling them amen he brings the
[1:01:06] answer by fulfilling the question amen
[1:01:09] as he would with jesus jesus was the
[1:01:12] fulfillment jesus was the answer
[1:01:14] to behold a virgin shall conceive jesus
[1:01:17] was the answer to all the things that
[1:01:19] was laying in there the bible
[1:01:20] that many people were looking to come in
[1:01:22] a different way in a different manner
[1:01:24] and a different time
[1:01:25] but god answered it anyhow and it went
[1:01:28] beyond all the critics and it went
[1:01:30] beyond all everyone that thought they
[1:01:31] had it figured out
[1:01:32] all the high priests that thought they
[1:01:34] had to figure it out every person that
[1:01:36] thought they had it all lined out amen
[1:01:38] and when he come they didn't recognize
[1:01:39] it see
[1:01:40] brother branham would say as long as you
[1:01:42] recognize it to be
[1:01:44] god when he answers you and that's the
[1:01:46] most important thing
[1:01:47] that when you can recognize this is god
[1:01:49] moving this is god answering you know
[1:01:52] he said you know many times he would say
[1:01:54] in another place he said if there was
[1:01:56] ever an hour
[1:01:57] that the church of the living god needs
[1:01:58] a joshua and caleb
[1:02:00] it is right now amen that would look at
[1:02:04] the word of god and say we have the
[1:02:05] answer
[1:02:06] we have the answer for this situation
[1:02:09] that we are more than conquerors amen
[1:02:11] we have the answer for our promised land
[1:02:13] god's already gave it to us
[1:02:15] he said so then all the little frantics
[1:02:17] and all the running this has got that
[1:02:19] and this is god
[1:02:20] stand still a minute god's got it
[1:02:23] amen god's got it the bible is the
[1:02:26] answer to
[1:02:27] every problem that's ever come up
[1:02:30] oh hallelujah his word is the answer to
[1:02:33] every
[1:02:34] problem that comes up it's in another
[1:02:36] place god has the answer
[1:02:38] that's what we want to talk about to
[1:02:39] have the answer god has got the answer
[1:02:43] he is the answer christ is the answer
[1:02:46] to every problem we've got amen so
[1:02:49] christ
[1:02:50] and so therefore if christ is the answer
[1:02:53] we have the answer
[1:02:54] because god has released it to us his
[1:02:57] people
[1:02:57] in this generation christ has come down
[1:03:00] in the pillar of fire as he did on moses
[1:03:03] brother brother wayne i'm actually
[1:03:05] borrowing the title from him because
[1:03:07] on saturday night i preached on amen the
[1:03:09] god who answers on sunday morning
[1:03:11] he got up and said we have the answer
[1:03:13] amen because
[1:03:14] if you would look in malachi 4 he would
[1:03:17] say you know i send you
[1:03:19] elijah the prophet but thank moses
[1:03:22] and he came down on a mountain amen and
[1:03:24] he met moses on a mountain to fulfill
[1:03:27] the
[1:03:27] to bring the law to bring the promises
[1:03:29] of god to the people
[1:03:31] amen and this is exactly what happened
[1:03:33] in our generation he met a prophet
[1:03:35] and he gave him the word of god he gave
[1:03:37] him the answer
[1:03:38] for laodicea he gave him the answer for
[1:03:41] every disease
[1:03:42] he gave him the answer for cancer and
[1:03:44] sugar diabetes
[1:03:45] and every situation that we could ever
[1:03:47] go through he gave him the answer for
[1:03:49] every spirit of hell
[1:03:51] amen this word that we have received is
[1:03:53] the answer for hell itself
[1:03:56] hell comes with questions we got the
[1:03:58] answer
[1:03:59] hell comes with his problems we got the
[1:04:01] answer hell comes with his situations
[1:04:03] and all the things around us
[1:04:05] and his storms and his waves and his
[1:04:07] ways we have the answer
[1:04:08] we have christ that's among us
[1:04:12] amen we have the answer to every
[1:04:14] circumstance we have the answer to every
[1:04:17] devil's question

[1:05:01] and you know and the next morning we'd
[1:05:03] get up and go to church and we'd
[1:05:05] minister on
[1:05:06] on the god that answers and we was
[1:05:09] you know it was very interesting that
[1:05:11] same weekend brother michael and sister
[1:05:12] bethany
[1:05:13] had scheduled to be there as well and
[1:05:15] without even knowing we would be there
[1:05:16] and we didn't know they was going to be
[1:05:17] there and
[1:05:18] not that that was a problem we just
[1:05:19] happened to be there together but you
[1:05:21] know we
[1:05:22] was there and they had asked brother
[1:05:23] michael to sing that morning
[1:05:25] and he gets up that morning and he
[1:05:27] starts mentioning a song
[1:05:29] the great physician now is near he said
[1:05:31] i love that song
[1:05:32] he said because that's the song that the
[1:05:35] the piano continued to play when that
[1:05:37] little girl
[1:05:37] a man would begin to raise her hand she
[1:05:39] you know she had saw something take
[1:05:41] place
[1:05:42] she saw the answer take home you know it
[1:05:44] was a little boy that was crippled with
[1:05:46] polio and
[1:05:47] and couldn't walk and brother branham
[1:05:48] was holding him in his arms he begins to
[1:05:50] pray for him
[1:05:51] he tells it many times and and he talks
[1:05:53] about how that he thought that the
[1:05:55] custodian had turned on a light and
[1:05:57] brought was blinding him in his eyes and
[1:05:59] and he thought that was kind of rude you
[1:06:01] know to do that
[1:06:02] in that moment but he did he said i
[1:06:04] began to realize it wasn't that
[1:06:06] it was the pillar of fire and he said i
[1:06:08] don't know if i dropped the boy or
[1:06:10] if he jumped out of my arms all i know
[1:06:12] is he was out of my arms as i was
[1:06:14] praying
[1:06:14] he come out of my arms his feet came
[1:06:16] straight he went running across the
[1:06:18] platform
[1:06:19] well that little girl sitting over there
[1:06:21] was like she was
[1:06:22] brother brandon would call her a dunkard
[1:06:24] which is basically an amish or a
[1:06:26] mennonite
[1:06:26] another little form of them and and she
[1:06:29] didn't know
[1:06:30] of course about the power of god she was
[1:06:32] just there maybe helping out in the
[1:06:33] service
[1:06:34] and she was playing that song the great
[1:06:36] physician
[1:06:37] now is near the sympathizing jesus and
[1:06:40] when that little boy come out of that
[1:06:41] little
[1:06:42] brother branham's arms and began to run
[1:06:44] her hands went up and she began to dance
[1:06:46] she began to praise the lord
[1:06:47] for what she had saw she saw the answer
[1:06:51] she saw god come and answer the question
[1:06:54] amen and the song and then the piano
[1:06:56] amen began he said it didn't just play
[1:06:58] one more note it played
[1:07:00] another whole the whole rest of the song
[1:07:01] just continued to play
[1:07:03] amen god apparently the angel of god
[1:07:06] knows how to play the piano
[1:07:08] amen and and so she began to speak in
[1:07:11] tongues
[1:07:12] and the piano never missed a note
[1:07:14] playing the great physician
[1:07:16] now is here the sympathizing jesus
[1:07:19] he speaks to the drooping hearts to
[1:07:21] cheer no other name but jesus
[1:07:24] and he said when that happened people
[1:07:25] began to flock down to the altar
[1:07:27] screaming god have mercy on me
[1:07:29] because they all they also witnessed the
[1:07:32] power
[1:07:33] of god to answer the question in a
[1:07:35] little boy's life
[1:07:37] amen and they saw god move in a
[1:07:39] supernatural way
[1:07:40] in a supernatural realm and so you know
[1:07:43] i'm i'm
[1:07:44] also asking god to do something to move
[1:07:46] and and
[1:07:47] and because i'm walking you know by
[1:07:49] faith and i'm but you still want to see
[1:07:51] god

[1:08:00] it'd be a dream
[1:08:01] whatever however i want you to come and
[1:08:03] i'm speaking on this subject
[1:08:05] on god coming at an unexpected time at
[1:08:08] an unexpected place
[1:08:09] in an unexpected way but god
[1:08:13] always answers and i said god has the
[1:08:16] answer for cancer
[1:08:18] he has the answer for a brain bleed he
[1:08:20] has an answer for every sickness
[1:08:23] he has the answer for every struggle he
[1:08:25] has an answer for every question
[1:08:28] is it all right if i preach what a
[1:08:29] preacher amen he's got the answer for it
[1:08:32] all

[1:08:38] healed there's an answer for that
[1:08:40] by my stripes you're healed
[1:08:43] [Applause]
[1:08:47] amen and so i'm telling that and i begin
[1:08:50] to speak about
[1:08:51] how the i mean the the angel of god the
[1:08:54] angels began to come to god
[1:08:56] amen gabriel and wormwood and began to
[1:08:58] talk about the three who were children
[1:08:59] who was about to step on the fire and
[1:09:01] i'm i'm bringing it out as brother
[1:09:03] branham would speak about that and
[1:09:04] how gabriel came with the sword drawn
[1:09:06] and he's like lord have you seen what's
[1:09:08] going on down there
[1:09:09] amen your children are standing for you
[1:09:11] they're they're holding they're holding
[1:09:13] the line they're not backing up
[1:09:14] they're not bowing but they're about to
[1:09:16] go in the fire have you been watching
[1:09:18] them father and he said yeah i've been
[1:09:20] watching them
[1:09:22] amen i'm thankful to have a god who's
[1:09:23] watching
[1:09:25] amen and wormwood comes up and he he
[1:09:27] says
[1:09:28] you know i'm the angel of the flood i'll
[1:09:30] i'll drown i'll drown out the fire i'll
[1:09:32] put it out just send me down there
[1:09:34] and i'm speaking all of that brother ron
[1:09:36] you know how has a little white round
[1:09:38] platform that goes out in front of his
[1:09:39] pulpit like that and i've stepped down
[1:09:41] there for some time and
[1:09:43] i'm bringing it all out like this and
[1:09:45] i'm talking about it
[1:09:46] and i said but god told those angels he
[1:09:48] said this is not a job for you
[1:09:50] this is a job for me he said you've been
[1:09:52] good angels but i'm going to go down
[1:09:54] there
[1:09:55] and i'm going to step in the fire
[1:09:58] oh hallelujah and as i'm speaking about
[1:10:01] how he took his
[1:10:02] robes off and he laid him on the throne
[1:10:04] and he grabbed the east and he grabbed
[1:10:05] the west wind
[1:10:06] and he grabbed a zig zag of lightning
[1:10:08] and as they took that step into the fire
[1:10:10] there was the fourth man he was the
[1:10:13] answer for the fire
[1:10:16] hallelujah amen and as i'm speaking of
[1:10:19] that i'm going to say could you
[1:10:21] imagine and i was going to finish it and
[1:10:23] say
[1:10:24] the king that was sitting there and he
[1:10:26] sees this take place
[1:10:28] he put three in there but now there's
[1:10:29] four men in there
[1:10:34] my ipad sitting behind me on the pulpit
[1:10:37] beginning to play a sermon
[1:10:41] as you can probably go back and watch it
[1:10:43] i was caught it was an unexpected time
[1:10:45] in an unexpected place
[1:10:46] in an unexpected way hallelujah
[1:10:50] apparently an angel knows how to use an
[1:10:52] ipad
[1:10:55] brother ron sitting behind me over there
[1:10:57] said he saw it light up
[1:10:58] he saw it change over to the app so it
[1:11:00] picked the sermon and pushed play
[1:11:04] i don't listen to sermons on my ipad i
[1:11:06] listened to him on my phone with my
[1:11:08] earbuds
[1:11:08] but so i i didn't even have it pulled up
[1:11:11] it picked out a sermon in 56
[1:11:14] the worst center in the city and it goes
[1:11:16] like this and it begins to speak my
[1:11:18] favorite hymn
[1:11:19] as i'm talking about him coming down the
[1:11:21] fire my favorite hymn
[1:11:23] the background of it you would only know
[1:11:25] how to come out
[1:11:26] my friend brother booth clibbon wrote it
[1:11:28] that on his knees by inspiration
[1:11:30] in a cornfield one night with pasteboard
[1:11:32] pieces in the bottom of his shoes for
[1:11:35] soles on his shoes sold it to wycliffe
[1:11:37] for a hundred dollars and he'd taken the
[1:11:38] copyright of the song he said but that's
[1:11:40] my favorite hymn
[1:11:41] now i'm looking i've been walking back
[1:11:43] around and i'm looking like thinking
[1:11:44] what's going on you know i'm trying to
[1:11:46] figure out what's happened to my ipad
[1:11:48] and i hear the prophet's voice speaking
[1:11:50] so i thought well this wasn't me so i'm
[1:11:52] just going to let it play
[1:11:54] and it says because it expresses
[1:11:57] the extreme deity of the lord jesus
[1:12:01] especially in a day like this when they
[1:12:04] try to make him just a prophet
[1:12:06] but he was more than a prophet he was
[1:12:09] god
[1:12:09] [Applause]
[1:12:13] at that moment i thought it was i just
[1:12:14] listened to a tape brother brown i'm
[1:12:16] talking about only believe but
[1:12:17] i believe that was paul raider that
[1:12:18] wrote that song at that moment i was
[1:12:20] thinking the only believer i got back to
[1:12:22] the office
[1:12:23] and i thought that ain't right and i
[1:12:24] looked up this man and he was speaking
[1:12:26] about
[1:12:27] down from his glory every living story
[1:12:31] my god and savior came and jesus is his
[1:12:34] name
[1:12:35] born in a manger to his own a stranger a
[1:12:38] man of sorrows
[1:12:39] tears in agony oh how i love him
[1:12:43] oh how i adore him my breath my sunshine
[1:12:47] my all in all the great creator became
[1:12:50] my savior
[1:12:53] hallelujah he became my answer
[1:12:58] when i was walking through the darkness
[1:13:00] and didn't know what was about to happen
[1:13:02] i found my answer jesus is the answer
[1:13:07] and he's not a thousand miles or a
[1:13:08] million miles off
[1:13:10] he has come down
[1:13:12] [Applause]
[1:13:15] what condensation bringing us redemption
[1:13:19] that in the dead of night not one faint
[1:13:21] hope inside
[1:13:22] but god gracious tender laid aside his
[1:13:25] splendor
[1:13:26] stoop in the woo to win to save my soul
[1:13:29] without reluctance flesh and blood and
[1:13:31] substance he took the form of man
[1:13:34] and revealed the hidden plan all
[1:13:36] glorious mystery
[1:13:37] sacrifice of calvary and now i know
[1:13:42] and now i know thou art the great i am
[1:13:47] oh how i love him oh how i adore him
[1:13:51] my breath my sunshine my all in all
[1:13:54] is there somebody here that can say yes
[1:13:56] he's the answer for my problems
[1:13:58] he's the answer for my situation he's
[1:14:00] the answer
[1:14:01] oh how i love him i love him when he
[1:14:04] comes on the scene
[1:14:05] and he changes it in a moment in a
[1:14:07] twinkling of an eye
[1:14:08] he is the answer and we have the answer
[1:14:14] it's god among his people walking among
[1:14:16] his people
[1:14:17] healing the raising the dead
[1:14:20] setting the captor free
[1:14:21] he is god
[1:14:34] he would play all the way till in the
[1:14:37] scripture he'd finish
[1:14:39] in the scripture lesson tonight in saint
[1:14:41] luke 7
[1:14:42] and the 36th verse he said when you go
[1:14:45] home
[1:14:46] finish reading that chapter well
[1:14:50] i did what he said
[1:14:54] in that chapter in luke chapter 7
[1:14:58] would be a man who needed a a healing
[1:15:01] for a servant
[1:15:03] be a centurion who had been good to the
[1:15:06] jews and even built them a
[1:15:08] place of worship and and and
[1:15:11] he had but you know he had a he had a
[1:15:13] need
[1:15:15] but he said lord he said he said hey i'm
[1:15:18] not even worthy that you even come to my
[1:15:20] house
[1:15:21] but you speak the word and my servant
[1:15:23] will be healed
[1:15:25] what happened he recognized jesus is the
[1:15:27] answer
[1:15:29] that he can speak the word because he
[1:15:31] said i'm a man of authority when i say
[1:15:33] this one to go they go
[1:15:34] when i say stay they stay when i say
[1:15:36] come they come
[1:15:38] he said when i say do this they do it
[1:15:41] and jesus would look at him and
[1:15:42] marvel and say i've not found so great
[1:15:45] faith
[1:15:46] no not in israel but when they went and
[1:15:49] returned to the house
[1:15:50] they found the servant whole that had
[1:15:52] been sick
[1:15:54] he was the answer to the sickness and
[1:15:56] then he would go from there and he would
[1:15:58] go down into the city
[1:15:59] and at the gate there was a dead man
[1:16:01] being carried out the only son of a
[1:16:03] mother
[1:16:04] it was a widow and there was much people
[1:16:06] the city with her
[1:16:07] and the lord saw her and had compassion
[1:16:10] on her
[1:16:10] and said we've not that's right because
[1:16:13] you've got the answer right here
[1:16:15] we've not and he said to the young man
[1:16:18] young man i say unto thee arise and he
[1:16:22] that was dead
[1:16:23] set up and began to speak
[1:16:27] hallelujah he delivered him to his
[1:16:29] mother
[1:16:31] this is all in that same chapter luke
[1:16:33] chapter 7
[1:16:34] and they would begin to you know talk
[1:16:36] about john the baptist but we're going
[1:16:37] to go on down to where he was reading
[1:16:39] from
[1:16:39] because his sermon was in 56 called the
[1:16:42] worst center in the city
[1:16:45] you know i
[1:16:50] try to put this all together what's the
[1:16:53] chances
[1:16:54] of it even pulling up a tape and playing
[1:16:57] on its own
[1:16:58] i've never had that anybody ever had
[1:17:00] that happen before
[1:17:01] i ain't never had that happen before
[1:17:05] brother wayne would tell me a testimony
[1:17:07] he actually i believe told it
[1:17:08] i've heard him tell it maybe it was on
[1:17:10] online somewhere
[1:17:11] of him being in a motel room and there
[1:17:13] was a question in his heart
[1:17:16] and all of a sudden his tape player his
[1:17:18] computer began to play i believe it was
[1:17:20] his computer
[1:17:20] wasn't plugged in didn't have a battery
[1:17:24] begin to play and it answered the very
[1:17:26] question that was in his heart
[1:17:29] so he's that kind of god he's the answer
[1:17:33] you might got questions tonight but if
[1:17:35] you're looking out in the world for your
[1:17:36] answer
[1:17:37] that ain't the place to find the answer
[1:17:39] there's that only going
[1:17:40] to bring more confusion and more
[1:17:42] misunderstanding
[1:17:44] amen you know we have the answer amen
[1:17:47] amen it was like i was telling them this
[1:17:49] weekend at those meetings you know i'm
[1:17:51] not looking for somebody else's approval
[1:17:53] on this message it's got god's approval
[1:17:56] on it
[1:17:57] that's all that matters so therefore i
[1:17:59] could care less what anybody else has to
[1:18:01] say about it
[1:18:02] any critic has to say about it anybody
[1:18:04] wants to build a website has to say
[1:18:06] about it
[1:18:07] i could care less what they got to say
[1:18:09] god said amen
[1:18:12] and he answered it
[1:18:18] but he was reading
[1:18:23] i don't know if i can i'm still so moved
[1:18:27] by these things
[1:18:29] he said one in verse 36 of luke chapter
[1:18:31] 7 one of the pharisees
[1:18:33] desired that he would eat with him and
[1:18:36] he went to the pharisees house
[1:18:38] and sat down to meet and behold a woman
[1:18:42] in the city which was a sinner
[1:18:44] when she knew that jesus said at meat in
[1:18:46] the pharisees house brought a
[1:18:48] alabaster box of ointment and stood at
[1:18:50] his feet behind him weeping
[1:18:53] and began to wash his feet with tears
[1:18:55] and he'd wiped them with the hairs of
[1:18:56] her head
[1:18:57] and kissed his feet and anointed them
[1:18:59] with ointment
[1:19:00] now when the pharisee which had bitten
[1:19:02] him saw it
[1:19:04] she spoke he spoke within himself saying
[1:19:06] this man
[1:19:08] if he were a prophet would have known
[1:19:10] who in what manner a woman this is that
[1:19:13] touches him
[1:19:14] for she is a sinner but what was the
[1:19:17] deal the woman saw him
[1:19:18] and knew he was the answer for her need
[1:19:22] the pharisees apparently didn't realize
[1:19:24] he's the answer
[1:19:27] he's the answer for our struggles he's
[1:19:29] an answer for what is going on around
[1:19:31] us he's an answer for all the confusion
[1:19:33] that's around us he's the answer but the
[1:19:36] prophet god said they left him
[1:19:37] and the bible says they left him in the
[1:19:39] corner with dirty feet
[1:19:42] because they didn't recognize who's
[1:19:44] among us
[1:19:47] and as i'm speaking about him coming
[1:19:49] down this verse is coming out
[1:19:53] he has come down but you got to
[1:19:55] recognize he's here
[1:19:57] you got to recognize he's in our
[1:19:58] services you got to recognize he is
[1:20:01] humongous
[1:20:01] you got to recognize who's moving and
[1:20:03] who's changing lives and
[1:20:05] who's touching lives and when you
[1:20:07] recognize it you'll worship him
[1:20:09] [Applause]
[1:20:11] when you recognize him you'll bring your
[1:20:13] best
[1:20:15] you'll give everything you got you'll
[1:20:17] lay aside
[1:20:18] everything around you and say i want to
[1:20:20] bring my best
[1:20:21] and lay it at the king of kings and the
[1:20:23] king lord of lords feet
[1:20:25] and wash his feet and thank him for
[1:20:28] taking all the sin away from me
[1:20:30] and thank him for healing my mama and
[1:20:32] thank him for doing all the things he's

[1:24:12] amen the captain of the lord's house
[1:24:24] and jesus answered him
[1:24:28] simon i have somewhat to say unto thee
[1:24:32] and he said master say on
[1:24:35] there was a certain creditor which had
[1:24:37] two debtors one owed 500 pence and
[1:24:39] another 50
[1:24:40] when they had nothing to pay he frankly
[1:24:42] forgave them both tell me therefore
[1:24:44] which someone which of them would love
[1:24:45] him most jesus answered and said i
[1:24:48] suppose that he to whom he forgave most
[1:24:52] amen and he said unto him thou hast
[1:24:56] rightly judged and he turned to the
[1:24:58] woman and said unto the simon see us
[1:25:00] thou this woman
[1:25:01] i entered into thy house that gave me no
[1:25:03] water from my feet
[1:25:04] but she's washed my feet with her tears
[1:25:06] wiped them with the hairs of her head
[1:25:08] that gave us me no kiss but this woman
[1:25:11] since the time i come in has not ceased
[1:25:12] to kiss my feet
[1:25:14] my head with all that i did is not
[1:25:15] anoint but this woman has anointed my
[1:25:17] feet with ointment
[1:25:18] wherefore i say unto thee her sins which
[1:25:21] are many
[1:25:22] are forgiven for she has for she loved
[1:25:25] much
[1:25:25] but to whom little was forgiven the same
[1:25:27] loveth little and he said unto her
[1:25:30] thy sins are forgiven
[1:25:33] hallelujah there was her answer
[1:25:36] thy sins are forgiven and they'd have
[1:25:38] sat and meet with him begin to say with
[1:25:40] himself
[1:25:41] who is this that forgive us sins also
[1:25:43] and he said to the woman
[1:25:46] thy faith has saved thee go in peace
[1:25:50] there's our answer for the situation
[1:25:52] that we're in tonight
[1:25:54] our faith has saved us we're going to
[1:25:56] walk in peace
[1:25:58] we're going to walk in peace because
[1:26:00] god's got it all in control
[1:26:01] he's moving when i don't even see him
[1:26:03] moving he's making a way when i can't
[1:26:05] see away
[1:26:06] he's doing it anyhow therefore i'm going
[1:26:09] to go in peace
[1:26:10] because my faith in the same word that
[1:26:13] raised lazarus
[1:26:14] is the same one today and i'm going to
[1:26:16] walk in that piece
[1:26:24] hallelujah what has happened is shown
[1:26:27] beyond a shadow of a doubt

[1:28:24] question
[1:28:27] we have the answer to the devil's
[1:28:29] question he
[1:28:30] christ has risen and he's paid the price
[1:28:34] and he's raising up the body to meet the
[1:28:37] head
[1:28:37] oh hallelujah the devil can't stand it
[1:28:40] that's the reason all these other
[1:28:41] kingdoms are setting up economical kings
[1:28:43] the reason they're all coming in to what
[1:28:45] they're doing now
[1:28:46] the devil that's the reason he's howling
[1:28:47] the way he is his wickedness of schemes
[1:28:50] has been uncovered
[1:28:51] by a resident risen resurrected christ
[1:28:53] and headship
[1:28:54] over his body he said you think i'm
[1:28:56] beside myself
[1:28:58] we got the devil's answer it's not me
[1:29:00] that liveth but christ
[1:29:02] the word is living in me it's not my
[1:29:04] idea it's not my power
[1:29:06] it's his power it's not my word it's his
[1:29:09] word
[1:29:09] he promised it and here he is he said it
[1:29:12] would be here
[1:29:12] we got the answer
[1:29:14] [Applause]
[1:29:17] christ has risen and has paid the price
[1:29:19] for our redemption
[1:29:21] what god in christ manifested he gave
[1:29:23] that flesh
[1:29:24] that blood that in that blood might come
[1:29:27] to life and the flesh be redeemed
[1:29:29] and the god and that god the redeemed
[1:29:31] flesh can manifest his word
[1:29:33] for the day as he did and for this day
[1:29:35] as he did in that day
[1:29:36] whoa glory he said you see it oh my he
[1:29:39] is the same
[1:29:40] yesterday today and forever he said then
[1:29:44] we stand
[1:29:45] justified in the presence of god as a
[1:29:48] drop of ink dropping into a full tub of
[1:29:50] bleach
[1:29:50] you'll never find a stain of ink no more
[1:29:52] anywhere
[1:29:54] did you hear that we have the answer
[1:29:57] amen that
[1:29:58] woman thy sins are forgiven
[1:30:02] not just forgiven but justified as
[1:30:05] though you've never
[1:30:06] done it in the first place
[1:30:07] [Applause]
[1:30:09] when the devil comes with your past you
[1:30:11] say what sins are you talking about
[1:30:21] what a man is truly redeemed that
[1:30:23] presses that predestinated seed
[1:30:25] sees it and accepted his sins
[1:30:29] are demolished it's gone it's dropped in
[1:30:32] the ink of the blood of jesus christ
[1:30:34] it never be remembered no more god
[1:30:36] forgets it and he stands as a son
[1:30:38] or daughter of god in the presence of
[1:30:40] god now
[1:30:41] we are sons of god not we will be
[1:30:44] we are right now
[1:30:49] we have satan's answer that's right
[1:30:52] amen did you hear me
[1:30:56] we have satan's answer because god has
[1:30:59] vindicated himself
[1:31:01] god has proved himself to his promise in
[1:31:03] this day
[1:31:04] the headship is here christ the risen
[1:31:06] lord is here with the same power
[1:31:09] of his resurrection that he ever was
[1:31:11] manifesting himself
[1:31:13] there's the devil's answer
[1:31:16] he said well that was back 50 years ago
[1:31:18] no we have the same answer
[1:31:20] he is here he has declared himself to be
[1:31:24] here
[1:31:25] he has declared he's the same healer
[1:31:27] he's the same deliverer
[1:31:29] he's the same god as he ever was
[1:31:33] that's the reason when men when this man
[1:31:35] sitting here dry he said drop dead the
[1:31:37] other day
[1:31:38] we could say come back to life why
[1:31:40] because the holy spirit said so
[1:31:42] that's what wyatt could do that to let a
[1:31:44] little baby in mexico
[1:31:45] have been dead for 15 hours when a
[1:31:47] vision said call it back to
[1:31:49] from death to life and let the baby live
[1:31:52] and the baby that the doctors wrote a
[1:31:53] statement died nine o'clock that morning
[1:31:55] and eleven o'clock that night came back
[1:31:57] to life again

[1:32:13] decayed
[1:32:17] dead in the grave four days and you
[1:32:19] brought him back to life again
[1:32:21] we hear of a baby that was dead for over
[1:32:24] 12 hours
[1:32:26] brought back to life again
[1:32:29] want to do that he had to heal every
[1:32:31] organ
[1:32:36] amen the head showed and the body
[1:32:40] has become one unit do we realize the
[1:32:42] day we're living in
[1:32:43] it's not us alone it's him and us
[1:32:45] working together
[1:32:47] amen one body one head one one rulership
[1:32:50] he said that's the reason the white
[1:32:52] husband and wife is no longer twained

[1:32:57] god's great revelation
[1:32:58] even bearing his name his name is jesus
[1:33:01] the anointed one
[1:33:02] that's the reason he's called jesus
[1:33:03] because he's the anointed one
[1:33:06] that's the reason you're called miss
[1:33:08] jesus because you're the anointed one
[1:33:10] amen proving manifesting god like he did
[1:33:14] that body did back there and that body

[1:33:18] and through their god worked his
[1:33:20] threefold manifestation
[1:33:21] go into the kingdom risen praise and
[1:33:24] repaid the price were redeemed
[1:33:26] god has proved it and we stand justified
[1:33:29] in christ before him
[1:33:30] and therefore we will not go to the
[1:33:34] judgment
[1:33:36] hallelujah because we've already got the
[1:33:38] answer for it
[1:33:42] he said oh if i could get the world to
[1:33:46] see that there you are
[1:33:48] there's the body of christ living
[1:33:50] standing

[1:34:14] purpose
[1:34:14] and we're proof of his victory and when
[1:34:16] we see him coming down
[1:34:18] living among the church that's his
[1:34:20] victory it shows that he couldn't keep
[1:34:22] good and keep him in the grave
[1:34:24] neither can they keep us

[1:34:38] epistle
[1:34:38] written of man amen i've written really
[1:34:41] rid of my goodness
[1:34:46] she's going to be a walking talking
[1:34:48] example of christ

[1:34:55] every trouble
[1:34:56] that's ever hit the per a person she is
[1:34:58] the answer

[1:37:02] that fruit as you're casting down
[1:37:04] criticizing worship and criticizing
[1:37:06] things and calling a bunch of
[1:37:07] fanaticism and emotional i question your
[1:37:10] seed
[1:37:13] i question who you really are
[1:37:18] amen because i can see you in the quotes
[1:37:20] i can see in the bible
[1:37:21] brother hasn't blessed me so much as a
[1:37:24] little boy
[1:37:25] had been in a wheelchair been bound in
[1:37:28] that thing and he was pronounced healing
[1:37:30] over his body

[1:37:33] healed in the name of jesus christ by
[1:37:35] his stripes you're healed
[1:37:37] as far as i know it wasn't a vision
[1:37:40] maybe maybe it was i didn't
[1:37:41] catch that but he said he told him he
[1:37:43] said by his stripes you're healed
[1:37:46] he took that and he began to confess it
[1:37:48] he began to speak it everywhere he went
[1:37:50] rolling around in his wheelchair and go
[1:37:53] up to any service heim's healed
[1:37:55] why are you healed because by his
[1:37:56] stripes i'm healed
[1:37:58] it was the answer to his question and he
[1:38:00] wasn't going to let that answer go
[1:38:03] until a bunch of ministers got around
[1:38:05] and said you know what you're causing a
[1:38:07] real show here
[1:38:08] you're bringing a disgrace on the name
[1:38:10] of the name of christ
[1:38:12] a reproach he looked at them ministers
[1:38:17] he said
[1:38:18] how can i be doing that he said let me
[1:38:20] ask you this
[1:38:21] if you were sitting where i'm sitting
[1:38:25] would you take the last hope i got
[1:38:28] by his stripes i'm healed and at that
[1:38:32] moment his body matched his confession
[1:38:34] the answer came down into his body and
[1:38:37] out of that wheelchair he went
[1:38:38] running around praising god
[1:38:42] oh come on now all you got to do is say

[1:40:45] though it's dry
[1:40:46] and broken apart it seemed to be no hope
[1:40:49] but the prophecy the answer
[1:40:51] was greater than the dry bones
[1:40:53] [Applause]
[1:40:53] [Music]
