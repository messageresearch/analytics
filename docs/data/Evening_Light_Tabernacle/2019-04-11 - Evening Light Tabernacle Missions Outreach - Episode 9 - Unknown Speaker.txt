TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so good to have you today to be with us on this session is where the ministry team and evening like Tabernacle and here in Minden Louisiana we're happy that you joined with us hope that you'll invite your friends and family to join with us today and share in this discussion that we're having we were discussing about how that the gospel of Christ is the power of God and the salvation and it gives us the power to live and overcome in life so does it does a Bible having these thing to say that we have to remain sinners or that we can be victorious I'm saying what's the Bible actually teaches about that what Paul in Romans 6 says let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lusts thereof neither UT your members as instruments of unrighteousness it goes on to say in verse 14 says for sin shall not have dominion over you so it shows that there's a power and you know I think in this world that we live in we we have so so many people that want to just say well you know I'm a Christian I'm a believer but I got this and I have this situation I have this little issue drugs whatever you know they allow that it kind of be like like we said last time a cop-out you know of but I believe that he didn't just come to save us in our sins they come to save us from our sins basil you go back to verse 1 and Romans 6 there it says what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound so we just keep sending that the grace of God so whoever our sins the Emperor sins and Paul pathetically says right behind it god forbid I should we have sure we that are dead in sin live any longer therein did to see this that's what we've been baptized into his baptism we raged with him in his resurrection we can't continue to live and see him because why because our desires and our natures have been changed that's what the whole new birth is about so old things have passed away all things all things become new when your creation and in being a new creation where a new genis are new species and we are born in the God life with the God species in verse 4 in Romans 6 it says there that we should walk in the newness of life amen so he's going through this whole rim of sin and the departure of sin and the newness of life and an overcoming victory as far as being reborn there's a newness that old life is dead amen you're not packing a dead corpse run with you the whole time it's a new life it's got life and it's got power in it that man's got to die for you to live victorious well do you have seven steps that you got to go through or some type of rehab in order to get this what's the deal there's a very simple prescription given on the day of Pentecost repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be filled with the Holy Spirit and with that comes the power to overcome all the things that used to bind you you know I don't think we should ever be guilty as those that have a form of godliness but denying you do that to me you get preeminence or you give power to the things of the enemy you say this thing of the enemy is more powerful than that then that Holy Spirit that I've accepted people that say well I'm born again but I still do this this and this what you're saying is that that life that Jesus Christ gave you isn't powerful enough to overcome those small hindrances of the devil and to me that's a slap in the face to the sacrifice that Jesus the price that he paid for us he didn't pay that price that we could continue in sin god forbid you bring a good point if we lived under the law then we very well may be defeated in our testimony right because the law didn't have the power to break nicotine to break alcohol to make sex spirits and it is ID 4 it would only condemn you but the blood of Jesus Christ when Christ died at Calvary he broke the backbone of Satan it's finished sin was absolutely finished at Calvary Satan has no rights the power of God destroyed every work of sin exam at that moment that day at Calvary crazily and then at the day of Pentecost when they received the life of God it was the very life of God the victory of God and the whole New Testament all the writers of the New Testament the scriptures that you're reading it all speaks over victory the victory over sin and power over sin and victorious lives so the Peter then that cursed and lied and denied Christ it was a changed man then babe at the Pentecost when the Holy Spirit came into him and he was filled with the Holy Ghost and brother Craig speaking about being under the law they were under the law there was under the blood of bulls and goats and you know that life and that lamb was slain it could not come back you know the life of a woolly lamb could not come back and the believers so that blood that blood would just cover the sin the man if it came in with lust he left with it he was forgiven there was a sacrifice that was but he still had it but I love a said about the power of Jesus him the blood of Jesus had broke the backbone and now we can see people we've all witnessed to the people that went through steps and programs trying to quit alcohol cigarettes chain-smoker generations of chain smokers in the just a moment in that presence well just gone I mean to say that I don't know what happened I don't even desire the not even desire not a desire matter of fact I even smell it in it is I mean it just total that's what the blood of Jesus because it's not a covering of the sin where that still had that you know whatever in your life but in knowledge and to me that's such a the church has done that is that they've turned the blood of Jesus Christ into a covering yeah I know where they treat it just like the blood of bulls and goats yes you're forgiven just as they were in the Old Testament but you still have that thing and you're still gonna fall to it and that's why you got to come back and ask forgiveness again and you're still gonna fall to it instead of the fact that the blood of Jesus is a bleach and when the sin is put in there it's done away with you can't find a trace of it it deals with the sin issue that's right see bleach has a power in it and it's the power of disassociation so you take a drop of ink and put it into a say a cup of bleach and in just a few seconds it's completely dissociated the contents and the elements of that ink is completely dissolved and it goes back to its natural first elements that it was actually originated from in the same way the power of the blood has it has the power to disassociate sin from our lives where we wants you to smoke or drink and desire to womanize or anything like that the power of the Holy Spirit the blood of Christ has a power to disassociate that and completely rewrite a man's life that Rick you know if you let they read about this bleach says no you not that unrighteousness shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you yeah but you're lost there you are there are sanctified you are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God and I will watch there means loosed loose perfect loosening from the bondage of sin whatever form that it come in it's washed us loose does freedom race alone and look God didn't free you to put you back in bondage Dave man their love didn't come to free us to put us back in bondage to something else brother they're free obviously obviously they they experienced the power of the blood in that first church amen does he do it today does the blood still hold the same sulla de lejos is their testimonies like this so you always a Christian no sir were you always a Christian then it has to hold brother Tim were you always agree said we all came in this world as the Bible says in sin did my mother conceive me or iniquity so he came born in sin shapen in iniquity but two had to have something else they had to be a new birth when we were born not from our natural parents and their genetics that they handed down but we got born again of a new spirit his spirit so that those two metas can be transferred into us his desires become ours and the sins the desires of sin is no longer there the longer thought about because while because like you said the power of sin is broken off of a believers life and now his desires are to please God yes that's right his nature has been changed he's not the same rough nature that he was born with in its natural world his nature's been conformed to the image of Christ Dave ban him Paul would tell us be not conformed to this world but transformed and I think that's where the church is missing it they're not being transformed by the power of God strictly moment they're conforming to this well we can bring a nice rock band into the church and get all the kids there I've had many people tell me about my workplace they're marvel that our young people how dedicated they are to the Lord like what do you do at your church so we preach the gospel to work yes we don't have rock groups we don't have West Country country-western we don't have social gigs we don't have pizza parties and things like it we preach the gospel because gospel is has the power to say this gospel can't save a man who are we to try to save a man that's right takes the gospel it takes the blood it takes preaching Christ and him crucified that's right a new man but not only crucified rose and the rest are resurrected again they come again and said they don't that they have penetrated in or into man to give them that Jemison that nature of the Holy Ghost here so shall we continue in sin god forbid I know what it's done for me personally yes I mean I was 20 to 21 years old when I met Christ I remember that night very vividly of me kneeling to sat beside my bed gone if you don't do something with this life I'm gonna take it because I don't have a desire to live anymore and would you believe it when I got up the next morning something happened a man I mean something notably happened my language completely changed overnight the words that would flow out of my mouth days and weeks and months prior to that or before that was all foul you know vulgar language but all suddenly begin to change it changed it immediately then things begin to fall and fall off and fall off that's the power of God amen and I'm taking the power is alive today to change a life you don't have to live in sin amen you can live above sin but there's only one way to live above seems and has to be born again in the spirit of a sermon I've experienced it I know it to be true I've met murders that have been converted by the power of God kill killers of more than eight people and I've I've seen drug addicts set free alcohol except homosexuals can be said exactly right people bound by depression and all manner of evil they don't have to live like that there is a power of God God can meet them in his power set them free and bring joy and live that's right and give them purpose for while they're here break the yoke of sin off of their life Dave Maass and I think Paul City you know so clearly of such for some of you that's that and every one of us you know were born in sin and had our experience in sin and so of such for some of you but you are lost but very simplified but you're cleanse by the side Jesus and what that blood is is the very blood life the Verte life of Christ comes into you and filled you with his spirit and that gives you that overcoming power amen amen it's it's a it is a must for yourselves today and factly agree if you if you're not living above seeing then something's wrong somewhere in your experience that's right and if your church is not preaching that you can live above seeing there's something wrong somewhere in that church yeah well you know today we make a lot of excuses you know even you know the ministers well um you go out and maybe live with a prostitute or be caught with a prostitute well you know what do you think they're just human well you see we're more than human when we're born again that's a person exactly in our first birth we were born human our second birth were born sons of God man and those who has us has a new birth who are truly born of the Holy Spirit they have the God life in them like I said you know one of our other sessions you know Jesus you know there was manifest in his life he had went away he sent back his own spirit because as the scripture says you don't have the the spirit of Jesus you're none of you exactly and the Spirit of Jesus came and now a hundred and twenty Jesus was there on the day of Pentecost sons of God who couldn't miss the powers of darkness and overcome and prevail well it's obvious by Paul's writings in the New Testament that the early church had this same revelation we're talking about exactly they didn't believe in walking in sins and claiming being saved they didn't they didn't believe that at all they believed in this but somewhere something began to change ever so slightly yes and so by the time that we arrived here today then we we have a powerless gospel you know there's no power to heal there's no power to deliver there's no power to say there's no power to live a clean life we have divorces and marriage and divorce and marriage and divorce all happen and in the Christian Church until they can't tell any difference between the church and the world right and that's what's a and it is sad why even to the point that we get homosexual ministers preaching the gospel right how do you preach the gospel when your life is full of scene the Bible said let him that name it the name of Christ depart from his iniquity I said the early church would not stand sin in the church they stood against it and and there there are many today that have substituted the the freedom of Christ the experience of Christ the full experience of Christ and they have tried to reform behavior they have they have substituted the power of God for counseling and psychology and taking different avenues that never can do what conversion can exactly never do it and I I just feel to say this while we're here that if there's someone listening in that you know that is hungry for God that to access this power you can access it right where you are a man through faith right and a lot of the time the problem is not the power of God a lack thereof it's the lack of faith in God's Word today no and there is an access I know by experience I wasn't saved in a church I was in my home right and I developed a hunger for God and I called upon him and he met me there and the Bible said all that call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved and you can access God right here and now and say God deliver me from this and reveal yourself to me and he will take you on from there and and I just want to say to those maybe the listening some maybe at their end or just feel like you know I'm so discouraged because I've gone from pillar to post church to church and I can't find that doesn't change the fact that God's truth still remains true today for every believer anyone that'll take him at his word that's right man that's right so today we found that churches have become a treatment center for sin and so they treat these symptoms of sin you know well you shouldn't commit adultery you know now you you should do this and reform your behavior and so churches have become a treatment center for sin and where they should be preaching and presenting a thin cure amen and that sin cure again is found in the tunel prescription where it was Acts chapter 2 verse 38 n every one of you and that means to turn from your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you know got to meet a sincere heart yes he says you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and this promises to you is to your children it's to them that are far off no matter how far you've strayed away from God as you know as many as a lawyers oh they'll call said God's call in your heart there's a God to respond to you if there's a deep calling to the DDS there's a deep - hey man and in our next session we're gonna talk more about the church and how it fell away and and and how that today that there is the power of God unto salvation to bring the church back on the right track again because God will have a church without spot or Ebay bye god bless you till we meet again thank you for joining the ministry team at evening light tabernacle for more information on what
