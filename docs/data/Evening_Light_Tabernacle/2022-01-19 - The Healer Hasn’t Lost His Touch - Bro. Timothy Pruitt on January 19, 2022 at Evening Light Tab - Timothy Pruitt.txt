amen be praying for me and brother tim and sister ruth we're going to leave in the morning and and go to be with the spencers this weekend as his brother ron's father passed away and the funeral will be this saturday and uh brother tim lord willing to be minister and brother ron's on sunday so just be in prayer for that and amen we know that we'll be in prayer for you at home and the services here amen god is good all the time amen luke chapter 9 and verse 12 and when the day began to wear away then came the twelve and said unto him send the multitude away that they may go into the towns and country round about and lodge and get victims for we are here in a desert place but he said unto them give ye them to eat and they said we have no more but five loaves and two fish except we should go and buy meat for all these people for they were about five thousand men and he said to his disciples make them sit down by fifties in a company and they did so and made them all sit down and when he took the five loaves and two fish and looking up to heaven he blessed them and break and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude and they did eat and were all filled and there was taken up fragments that remained to them 12 baskets amen we let you be seated amen actually was headed a different direction to about the middle part of today and just hit a little something that just shot through me and so we just felt to move this in this way so i'd like to speak to you this evening on the healer hasn't lost his touch amen the healer hasn't lost his touch i want to look at this scripture for a moment and it's a very amazing scripture and a very amazing event that took place as god would or jesus would take the uh few loaves of bread and a few fish and he would he would begin to multiply them and i thought it was very interesting because it's actually as you read about it it's when the day began to wear away it was in the evening time and it was uh you know in a place and a place that they couldn't go gather something on their own as we read as in the desert place and you know and the disciples their thought was to send the multitude away and for them to go provide for themselves but that wasn't jesus thought he he had another thing in mind he wanted to provide for them he wanted to do something for them that they could not do for themselves and we can say what a miracle that took place as he would it was actually the very very creation that was taking place maybe they didn't catch it right at first and didn't see it as he would take small loaves and and a few fish and break them and multiply them and feed 5 000 that were counted as men there's really no telling how many people were actually there and you know in doing so as we know he bypassed the planning he bypassed the growing he bypassed the harvest he bypassed the kneading he bypassed the baking he broke off a piece and another took its place and he had enough for every person who wanted it he had it enough for every person who desired it he had enough because he is more than enough he was shown once again that he's jehovah jireh and he's the same way today with his healing with his forgiveness with his mercy with his grace and with his love whosoever desires it whoever whosoever wants it he's got it and not only does he have it he has more than enough and i'd like to declare again tonight that he is still in the miracle working business it doesn't matter if you're in a desert it doesn't matter if you're in a place that you haven't seen god move in a very long time that does not change who god is god is is still a healer he's still a deliverer he still forgives sin he still applies mercy he he still uh gives a grace and love and compassion to whoever wants it he's got it amen he's still in the miracle working business so it doesn't matter who says he can't it doesn't matter who says he won't it doesn't matter how many rise up and says he hasn't done it in a long time it doesn't matter how many says it's all gone it's all past and that does not make it so amen brother brandon would say it like this he said the days of miracles has not passed as says the theologians if the days of miracles is passed the day of god is past so if we are still in the day of god i believe we are amen and we're still in his day and his time and his ways and his will then the days of miracles are not past he said the days are miracles you say the question the days of miracles is passed he said when the day of miracles is passed the day of god is past for god is miracle certainly the days of miracles never will never was and never will be passed amen because he's still here now doubters may say you don't see many miracles anymore many healings anymore many deliverance no more there's so many that's been waiting for their answer to come for seemed like a long time many get weary many want to give up but there's a great news god is still god and god is still on the throne and he hasn't lost his touch if he healed then he still heals now if he saves then he still saves now amen why are you preaching like this because there's still sickness there's still sin there's still unbelief that's trying to creep into our ranks and to the places to where we put god in a place of past or a god of history but we have to bring him from that place and say god is still the same today as he was yesterday what he did then he does now he's still the almighty he's still the same yesterday today and forever his power is still showing up his power is still healing his powers can i get a witness his power is still delivering amen broken bones are still being put back in place no surgery needed taste is still being restored nerves are still being healed pain is still leaving bodies healing's coming to the body god hasn't lost his touch amen i know what he can do i felt it myself i witnessed it myself and i have found him to be faithful i've seen him move i've seen him deliver i've seen him heal i've seen him do so many things among us it'd be a shame it would be a sin to disbelieve now because he hasn't lost his touch he's still the same unchanging god his power is still moving his power is still healing his power is still delivering he still restores he still heals he still redeems and no matter how many doubters may say it ain't so i still believe amen hallelujah there's something about the touch of the master amen there's something about his touch we can read about it in the bible we can read in luke chapter seven we're going to go through these really quick luke chapter 7 and verse 12 said when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold there was a dead man carried out and the only son of a mother and she was a widow and much people of the city was with her and when the lord saw her he had compassion on her oh my i like to be one of the kind of people that his look towards me is not a look of judgment it's not a look of of scorn but it's a look of compassion i believe there is a people that he's turned his eyes to that his eyes has upon them tonight and his eyes is upon you i i want you to understand that even as dark as it is he still sees you it's still as bleak as it is it may seem around you and problems that you can't handle and you don't know what to do with god's eye is still upon you and it's not an eye of judgment it's an eye of compassion and a high of love and i have mercy and i have grace hallelujah amen you might be on your way to a funeral but those eyes turn towards you you might be on your way to a doctor and get a bad report but those eyes of compassion to oh hallelujah and he came and he touched the beer he says that how you pronounce it yeah i went and looked it up the beer that's like that's a place it's actually a thing that holds the casket and that they bury him stood still and he said young man i say unto thee arise and he that was dead sat up and began to speak and he delivered him to his mother [Applause] hallelujah he's still a god who hasn't lost his touch your young person might be dead somewhere but god where there's a god of compassion can look towards them and touch whatever is holding them and say son daughter arise and go to your father's house amen he's a god who hasn't lost his touch matthew 8 and verse 3 says and jesus put forth his hand to a leper and touched him and said i will be thou clean and immediately his lepers she was cleansed he still does that amen we know a leprosy is a as a type of sin amen i've seen god come in the midst of his people and take a drug addict or a man who couldn't quit drinking and touch him it was such a touch that's a day he's not drinking another drop he's not touched another beer he's not touching another drug he hasn't lost his touch [Applause] hallelujah he's still the same god today he still cleanses people from sin and i'm not talking about a change or a turning over a belief i'm talking about a changing of a nature that'll so change them so they're not the same person anymore he's that kind of god hallelujah amen matthew 8 verse 14 said when jesus was coming to peter's house he saw his wife's mother laid and sick of a fever and he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose and ministered unto them you notice what the theme here she touches and they arise oh hallelujah he touches them and they stand up they move up they move to other places and other heights that they thought wasn't possible anymore here tonight you're here because of what he is touching your life amen amen you remember what that touch was like when he came and touched your life and you begin to move into places you never thought possible before you never thought you was able to do it but god reaching mercy and hows of compassion turned and touched you hallelujah matthew 9 and verse 28 says when he came to the house the blind men came to him blind men came to him and jesus saith unto them believe ye that i am able to do this and they said unto him yay lord then touch t their eyes saying according to your faith being unto you and their eyes were opened amen amen i'm looking tonight and a bunch of people that used to be blind people amen cankered over with the things of this world go into a sinner's grave and a sinner's hell and been lost and without god but god rich in mercy touched your eyes he puts myself on there to where you can see the things of god and realize it ain't just an old history book somewhere it's not just something written about somebody else or some figment of some man's imagination who ate too much of a bunch of beans and a bunch of onions but it's the written word of almighty god and not is it just talking about somebody it's talking about me god rich and mercy has taken the shackles off of our eyes he hasn't lost his touch maybe here tonight you got shackles on your eyes he still can open them there is a bomb and killer yeah that'll break the shackles off of your life [Applause] he hasn't lost his touch genesis 32 and verse 25 we can read about jacob when he saw he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him jacob received his touch and it changed him he walked different he thought different he acted different he wasn't the same man matter of fact he didn't even go by the same name no more whoa hallelujah hallelujah we're looking at a lot of people tonight that don't go by the same name no more because god touched you in your life amen one day he was by the name of deceiver went by the name of drug addict or went by the name of drunk or went by the name of i am whatever kind of name the devil tried to put on you but one day you met an angel and he had lost his touch and the same angel that touched jacob and changed his name now changes your name from deceiver to redeem from god from a sinner to forgiven amen from godless to the son of god [Applause] amen he hasn't lost his touch we read in daniel 8 and verse 18. he said as he was speaking with me i was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground but he touched me and he set me upright hallelujah now he's talking to some chosen people amen once she was down on your ground on the ground looking the wrong way but god said i got something to show you amen i want you to change your position here you're not you're not billion that's not what you're made for to be in the dirt your face down in the dirt and the devil rubbing you in the dirt but i want you to i want to touch you and lift you up and set you up right cause i got some things to show you i want to make thee known what shall be at the last hand for at the time appointed the end shall be hallelujah he's brought a people that had their face the wrong way and they was down and they was in a deep slumber and a deep sleep but by the touch of the master he brought them out of that darkness into the marvelous light that their eyes can be opened cause i got some stuff to show you i want to show you my word i want to reveal to who you are i want to give you my love and my grace sit upright hallelujah he hasn't lost his touch amen you remember that you were sitting in darkness yes sir he would say that about a people that was there in the second exodus he said there was a people who sat in darkness but they saw a marvelous light amen there was something he wanted to show them awaken them out of the place that they were amen that's what the word is trying to do to you awaken you it's a deep that calleth into the deep it's a deep that's trying to touch you deeper than you ever been touched aim in a place amen where god can reveal the secrets of his heart amen that's why this word is so important to a believer because they know what it does when it touches their life they know what it does when it changes them it changes their attitude it changes their thought process it changes everything about them amen hallelujah this master hasn't lost his touch hey man i don't care you may have been sick for a long time and brother ron you've been dealing with it for two years now over two years but the master hadn't lost his touch we got witnesses here tonight god heals cancer by the miraculous hand of god amen let me tell you it wasn't the medicine that did it god uses that but what happened that was a supernatural event that took place right here before how many have witnessed said come on let me get some hands how many witnessed that that was a miraculous event that took place it was the touch of the healer who would reach down and touch a little frail body amen when the medicine was almost trying to kill her and she couldn't hardly rise up but that day she said i want to go to church because she knew being in his presence what it would do to her oh hallelujah amen listen we ain't dependent on medicine for brother ron's situation i'm going to be honest with you remedies really ain't got a good end to it in this situation amen what's got a good end is the touch of the master and i'm here to witness tonight amen by the presence of almighty god god hasn't lost his touch he healed cancer one time he'll do it again hallelujah let me get your eye this is at the end but i can't save it to the end come on amen this is just too good to save how many righteous we got in the house tonight amen i'm about to go back so you're going to give me some grace this scripture came to me about making me do a flip isaiah 3 10 says say ye to the righteous that it shall be well with him hallelujah let that word break forth tonight say to the righteous it shall be well [Applause] why because he ain't lost his touch he's still a healer he's still a deliverer he's still the same yesterday today and forever he's still my god cancer can't stop him high blood pressure can't stop it drugs keep stopping every kind of evil can't stop it they ain't enough devils in hell that can stop my god he hasn't lost his touch come on rejoice in this god we got tonight he's here to touch you tonight maybe you've had withered hands and you're back with this and now but god is here to touch you he ain't lost his touch he proved it over and over what kind of touch he had well and the same touch he had is the same touch he has hallelujah maybe you feel like today like these two men i'm about to read about cleopas and his buddy on the way to emmaus luke chapter 4 and verse 13. so two of them went the same day to a village called emmaus it wasn't a dark time it's what seemed like a dark time but it was one of the greatest times and this is where i was going to go this evening was out of darkness and into light during chaos here they were seemed like in chaos everything around them had changed very quickly and very rapidly the one they loved and been following for years had now been put on a cross and put in a grave but what they fail to realize that morning they're walking and they're in the molly groves he's risen and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together in reason jesus himself drew near and went with him but their eyes were holding they should they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communication are these that you have one to another as you walk in are sad and the one of them whose name was cleopas answered and said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem has thou not known the things which are come to pass in these days and he said unto them what things there's a concern in jesus of nazareth with the prophet matty indeed and word before god and all the people and how the chief priests and all the rulers delivered him to be condemned to the death and crucified him but we trusted he that that had been he which would have redeemed israel besides all this to this day the third day since these things were done but now certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulcher and they found out his body and said they seen visions of angels which said that he's alive and certain of them which was with us went to the sepulcher and found it even so as the women said but him they saw not he said oh fools and slow of heart to believe all the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things he entered in his glory beginning at moses all the prophets expounded them all the scriptures things concerning himself and they drew nine to the village where they went he made as though he would go further but they constrained him abide with us for us toward the evening the day is far spent notice again toward the evening time where are we at the evening time the day is far spent and he went into terry with him and it came to pass he said it meet with them and took bread and blessed it and break and gave it to them and their eyes were open and they knew him oh the master hadn't lost his touch what do you think happened it wasn't just the way he tore a piece of bread in the sense of taking a a piece of bread and just tearing it in half and here's your piece and here you know he took a piece of bread and he tore it off and another one took his place he took up he hadn't lost his touch he was showing you in this day that i'm the same jesus that was before i went to the cross i've risen from the grave i'm still the same and i haven't lost my touch so if i pulled off a piece of bread and gave it to one you can have a piece of bread if you want it you can have healing if you want it you can have deliverance if you want it you i got more than enough and listen he done it in our generation for for years to a prophet's ministry he tore a piece of bread after a piece of bread after a piece of bread and it showed healing after healing deliverance after liver listen he ain't run out of bread because he said i am the bread of life hallelujah he is still there creating and moving and changing and healing and delivering and doing all the things he did before because he hasn't lost his touch you might be sick tonight but there's a piece of bread for you you might be down in the dumps tonight but there's a piece of bread for you you might be depressed and all down and wondering how it's all going to happen how it's all going taking place and meanwhile there's a resurrected jesus christ walking in your midst i say tonight may he do what he did before tear up a piece of bread and show you i am in the mix [Applause] the lord has risen brother would say like this he said that one beautiful thought of christianity even today as we speak of this marvelous gospel we know we don't have to take a hearsay or a historical thing because it's been proven that jesus christ lives and reigns and is raised from the dead and is alive forevermore what do you think happened in our midst the other morning it was bread being tore off it was healing being tore off he paid for it at calvary if you happen to walk in that line and you haven't received it yet don't give up you already seen the signs of it so you know he was there hey man you saw him put a little girl's bones back together where she didn't have to have surgery that was a miracle hey man you saw him restore taste brother derek came and said i want my taste back i'm not going to settle with the devil i want it back and by the next sunday morning god came by and healed him it was a piece of bread handed to her it was like hey that bread tasted good didn't it hey man what was it when he came by to that psych i want to call it a psychotic nerve i know they think what it is sciatic makes you psychotic thank you brother phillip i got that from hey man it makes you sometimes psychotic but he would come by and he would heal a sciatic nerve whatever it is still the devil gets on a body and tries to anoint it but god came by with a piece of bread that lord and said here's your peace others have been suffering with covenant and god came by that morning said here's your peace if you happen to be in that line i wouldn't get i out wait till i got to eat that piece of bread and god that began to work in my body and changed it in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we know about his touch he hadn't lost it we we know but the story of those two women it's just too powerful to pass up those two women in the neighborhood that morning amen got up one was fixing breakfast and she thought man i'm hungry and but i don't know if i can if i hear but you know she's thinking about all these things and knowing if she ate some of that stuff what it would do to her but she said that morning she just felt a cool feeling how many's ever felt that brother ron remembers that feeling when that burst of air came over him and gave him a new lungs the healer ain't lost his touch oh my god amen he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen how many has ever felt that feeling they sweep over your body and you know right there it's over with it's done there ain't nothing the devils can say nothing nothing devils can do it's over with amen i witnessed it in my own body my own life amen when god would just sweep over me and i would feel that all of that action and i said it's over why because i know his touch these women were there in that neighborhood that morning amen have we just seen the same thing happen in our day the angel went through the neighborhood he knows your street address he knows where you live he knows exactly how you like your coffee how you like your breakfast and what you like to eat he knows all about it when he comes walking through mendon louisiana handing out bread oh my god amen this is what brother battle said he said what happened when that woman received her healing and she was able to eat what she wants she goes down to the neighbor amen she had that border on her and she got up that morning and it fell off and she was screaming and hollering she the woman thought well this woman something doesn't happen she runs in there and she's shaking out the sheets and said it was here but now it's gone it was here but now it's gone oh hallelujah i pray this evening we can wave that old white flag of victory this evening said it was here but now it's gone it was here but now it's gone why he hasn't run out of touch he hasn't run out of breath he hasn't run out of meat he hasn't run out of the goodness of god he hasn't run out of victory and peace and harmony and joy or whatever you have need of he's showing the same mercy he said 2000 years ago he's just as present as he was then walking down the shores of galilee with the disciples he's doing the same things he's performing the same miracles he's showing the same mercy he's preaching the same gospel he's not dead he's alive forevermore he said how happy our hearts ought to be it ought to make christians today to know this is not some curious philosophy we're understanding but this is the power of the resurrection of the lord jesus christ hallelujah as a great point saint paul said he said he said that being the only educated one among the disciples he said but i don't come to you with excellency a word or the speech of some man and tyson wisdom but i come amen in the power and demonstration of the holy ghost that your faith will not rest in men but it will rest in god amen he said how we love that to know the same thing that paul preached in the days after the resurrection of christ is the same thing tonight and it can be proven here again his infallible proof that jesus christ is alive i was just reading about his touch brother brown you remember the story of his wife slammed the door and god saw that didn't like it the tumor began to grow brother brandon tore up about as his wife he loved her and like what what what to do about it what he's one morning he's up praying and he said all of a sudden he came in the room and he said stand up he said i asked you because he's praying about his wife he says as you say so it shall be and he said before the doctor's hand touches her that tumor will be gone he said she's in the place here tonight as a witness that she could hardly go into the doctor's office and get on her gown and hardly get up on the table and lay it over there with a sheath and as soon as he came to take the sheet off to touch her he looked and it was gone oh hallelujah oh my my the master's touch he can come in a moment says loriann understand you're facing a pretty major surgery with your foot i believe god can touch you that you don't even need the doctor's touch but the healers in the house tonight amen to touch and remove the pain amen a doctor comes and he cuts this and he cuts that and it takes months of healing god can do it in a moment that's his touch hallelujah amen we saw it as we said sister atlanta it was a moment of touch it wasn't months and months and months and months of agonizing after that when he touched her in that moment it was over with and it doesn't matter how dark it is it doesn't matter how close you get to a knife it doesn't matter how close the devil gets to you i'm not trying to make the doctor the devil would understand me the devil's trying to also touch you he's also trying to grab a hold of you but before he can get to you god already got there whoa hallelujah amen we know how the devil tried to do some of you he tried to destroy your life he tried to bring every kind of thing upon you that you could never be anything it was impossible to do anything for god anymore because your life was all scarred up but before he could do all of that god touched you and you're here tonight sitting on these pews why not because your own ideas and your own walter here because of the master's touch [Applause] what a marvelous day it must have been when cleopas and his friend was walking down the street but they were brokenhearted bible said they were you know they were down they were trying to figure it all out he says you got to remember you're not ever going to figure it all out so many people try to know the doctrines of the church and they think that's life all those things are good but to know him he said that's where you got to get to that life it's good to know your books it's good to know your doctrines but all of that is on the sideline but to know him is life for he that because he said for he that heareth my words and believeth on him has sent me hath everlasting life and shall never come into condemnation but it's passed from death and life jesus made those statements and those words that were made were that were after there were no those words will remain after there's no more stars no more moon then words will still be in effect and just as powerful as the day he spoke them because his words cannot fail so they're here they're walking along man jesus supposed to be coming so much trouble around so much stuff going on so much tragedy i i've heard of more deaths this past couple of years and i've heard in all my life and surely if jesus was going to come he'd come by now and meanwhile he's been walking with the church he's been there the whole time amen trying to reveal himself and show you what's been going on all down to the dark ages and all for the ministering of the prophet of this age down to our time and where we're at and walking along it's in the evening time and here they thought well you know man the one we trusted to come and deliver us from the romans uh man they beat him and he's dead and crucified and buried and sealed had been put on his grave and garrison placed in front of it if anybody would break that seal they'd be put me to death mom we watched how his mother has suffered and she's had a oh my loving mother like that see her son go to the cross and be stripped down naked and beat into a pulp and bones in his hands parted by the cruel roman nails and disgraced and dishonored heard him screaming for mercy and how could this be of god how how could this be the way it's supposed to be how could this be the way it's supposed to work out covet i mean we got so much disease we got this and we got how can this be and somebody steps out of the bushes on a wednesday night says you know what i still haven't lost my touch i'm still a healer i'm still a light giver i still can bring you life and life more abundantly i i still can save you young people i don't care how dark it is it can be so bad they can't even see their hands in front of their face and you can't see no way out but i can still go to them and i can touch their caskets and i can say rise and go to the father's house i haven't lost my touch it doesn't matter what the devil's doing and how bad it's around us and how terrible it is and how this was losing that one that one's lost this one this one's died over here and that one's died over here and this one don't remind that when one week they lost almost everybody and this i haven't lost my touch i haven't left the church i haven't left you i'm still walking among you passing out bread giving you strength for the journey take another step don't stop here you got to keep on going we got a few more miles to go we got a few more devils to defeat we got a few more services to have and stomp a mud hole in the devil we got a few more times in this human flesh amen to wear that devil out when he tries to come and says there ain't no more god and we'll rise up and we'll say yes there is i know he's still the same yesterday today we got a few more times when young people will get drunk on the holy ghost we got a few more times when the presence of god will fall in here it'll get so thick that the preacher can't even preach no more we got a few more times of god moving in our midst we're looking at the darkness and start looking at the lights he starts explaining to them what's all been happening why it's all taking place and what's going on and why we're still here because there must be a few more seeds and some of them might be your children i'll say it even more direct some of them are your children if i was you i just grabbed that one say unto the righteous it shall be well say unto the righteous your children your offspring shall be there say unto the righteous the promises unto you and your children god works all things together for the good he had to bring them to that talking about jesus how could you have listen to this brother the prophet of god he said how could you ever have confidence in your loved one being raised from the dead if only you just had enoch that had been translated or elijah that went home in a chariot if only had them we'd be miserable but this man died he died till the sun knew he was dead the moon and the stars knew his dead he died into everything in the earth and heaven knew he was dead that he might die the death of every mortal and that ever lived the worst death of man could ever die but because he died we can now live he died he was mistreated he came in the way by the way and the came into the world by the way of a barn no place to lay his head when he came over he was rejected by the people he didn't even have a place to be buried the earth refused him the heaven wouldn't have him because he's coming as a sinner not his own sin but my sins he was bearing the sins of the world upon him so he was rejected in heaven and earth didn't want him they had to lift him up between the heavens and the earth and let him die outside of heaven and outside of earth what a savior how could you turn that down such a person as that for modern theology or for the persons of the people when you know when you know that you've got to stand in his presence in the day of judgment to give account for your life god won't hold you responsible for being a sinner god will hold you responsible for rejecting the way out of it wow you can't help being a sinner you was born that way but god has given you a choice your nature's a sinner you can't help it but jesus made a way out and he ain't lost his touch hallelujah oh my mary no doubt to think you know one day i was packing some water to a whale an angel visited me and spoke to me out of a big light said that holy thing which is born of thee shall be called the son of god how could god ever permit his own child hanging there suffering bleeding twisting and dying how could it be they were looking at any time for him to come from the cross but if they didn't realize if he had came off that cross we would be left sinners today he said they paid him the greatest compliment pharisees did when they crucified they paid him the greatest compliment he said he saved others but he can't save himself they didn't realize that if he saved himself he wouldn't be able to save others he would have lost his touch amen but he had to give himself an order to save others it was a compliment to him them not even know it and he said and men today in modern theology try to make him preach in a social gospel just a philosopher or just a good man or a fine scholar or two lords just a teacher he was more than that he was god himself made flesh among us he was divine his blood did not come from any mortal man it came from the created power of jehovah god his father he was divine he proved it when he broke the seals of death and he rose on the third day but how many of the disciples would dishearten when all this was taking place peter went back fishing as did others how little do they know on this beautiful first easter morning that jesus christ was alive and among his people they thought he was dead and he said and so do they think so today many people who really love jesus fail to understand he's right with us living resurrected here among us they teach it as a historical affair or it's a history the bible is not just history it's prophecy it's being fulfilled even today he's not dead he's risen amen there's many fine christian people this morning belong to fine churches who don't realize that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and is alive among us who is us the bride of jesus christ amen i'm gonna say among us today with the same powers say it same powers same principles same acts that he did here on earth little does people know that and they were just wondering but while they're thinking about it he appeared and he comes out and he said that's the way he usually comes is when you're thinking about him i'll just drop this in because i think it's just real beautiful he said that's you when you usually find your greatest blessing you housewives children going to school and you're out by yourself washing dishes running to sweep on the floor or something when you're eating your lunch maybe by yourself reading the bible on the side somewhere when you're on your road going home in the car you're meditating he said then that's when he comes by with the trouble we're thinking about too many other things we're thinking about how bad it is thinking about how difficult things are how dark it is quit thinking about that think on him he hasn't lost his touch they went wrong along the road that morning they had seen him mocked made fun of we're seeing it in our day they're mocking they're making fun saying it ain't so he's not coming back mocking it to such a christianity to such a point to where you can't even hardly speak the name of jesus christ or even god in the school anymore but just seeing just seeing a a a news clip on fox shared with me amen by the ledels of how they're now starting satanist clubs in our schools how is that possible and the man there's crying out about it's like how can you do that when you can't even quote the old testament in the new testament but darkness is coming it's here and it's getting worse but that doesn't change his promises that doesn't change who he is that doesn't change what he does that doesn't change that he's that he won't can't fulfill his word or are not able anymore he's still the same yesterday today and forever he hasn't lost his touch he hasn't changed who he is in the day that we're living in the holy ghost is still the same i don't care what the critics say they can say the holy ghost ain't the same no more that he's lost his touch but the holy ghost has not lost his touch the same holy ghost that changed peter is the same holy ghost that changes you it'll change you from a backbiter and a slanderer and a and denying jesus christ it'll change you from that to a man of boldness that'll stand there and witness the glory of god and give your life for this gospel it hasn't lost his touch how many witnesses we got of that the holy ghost ain't lost his touch he still gives the same overcoming power he still comes down and changes nature and changes hearts and changes he still saves young people let me get on down real quick come down to the place where there's about to pass by and he said he does that sometimes he said he'll come right into service and he'll make as if he's going to pass by he said dad with you with the heart trouble mother you with cancer that's going to die you say well i've been a christian all my life why would it happen i've asked him why won't it happen i've asked him but maybe he's just made like he's going to go on by he said that's what he'd done to cleopas in them but he knew all the time he was going in there oh hallelujah oh glory to god sometimes he makes like it but he's just waiting for somebody to reach out and grab his garbage say god i need you i i need you in my home i need you in my life i need to have fellowship with you i need your touch yes he act like they was going to go on by he act like it but they constrained him said come on in we love you we want to talk with you some more come on in come about with us he said can you do that today he talks to the methodist can you the baptist presbyterian nazarenes pilgrim holiness catholic lutherans can you do that message believers can you do that regardless of what the church says come on in amen if they don't want the holy ghost i still want the holy ghost if they don't want his presence i still want his presence if they don't want his worship i still want his worship if they don't want his breath i want his bread come on in come and abide with us listen to this statement he's never asked asked unless you receive so in other words every time he's asked you receive so don't pass up your opportunity he said ask and you shall receive knock and it'll be open seek and you shall find for everyone that seeketh fine unto him to knock it it will be open to him that ask will receive not maybe you will you will receive but you got to ask come in come in with us he turned to come back walked in the little hut might have been just a little small place on the side of the road and as it is in many of those countries a little mud and some sticks while the king of glory ever was stooping to a place like that but there's never a place too little i'm fixing to get to some real good stuff so just hang on with me there's never a church too small there's never a person too rejected by the world there's never a woman two fallen there's never a man too drunk but he will come when he's asked there's never a man too sick there's never a woman too discouraged that he won't come when he's asked [Applause] you've been asking he's coming [Applause] hallelujah if you've been asking don't worry he's on the way he's coming with all the heavily hosts and he's going to answer what you've been asking and he hasn't lost his touch hallelujah he said may i say this even now there's never a person who's too sick there's never a person who's gone too far hallelujah did you hear that parents there's never a child that's gone too far that has mercy can't find them and bring them back i don't know if he's even here tonight but
