[48:05] and i will call on the name of the lord
[48:08] and the god that answered by fire
[48:10] let him be god and all the people
[48:13] answered and said it is well spoken
[48:16] down to verse 36 and it came to pass
[48:20] at the time of the offering of the
[48:21] evening sacrifice
[48:23] that elijah the prophet came near
[48:26] and said lord god of abraham isaac and
[48:29] of israel let it be known this day
[48:32] that thou art god in israel that i am
[48:34] thy servant
[48:36] and that i have done all these things at
[48:38] thy word
[48:39] hear me o lord hear me that this people
[48:42] may know that thou art the lord god
[48:45] and that thou has turned their heart
[48:47] back
[48:48] again then the fire of the lord fell
[48:51] and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[48:54] wood
[48:54] and the stones and the dust and licked
[48:57] up the water that was in the trench
[49:00] when all the people saw it they fell on
[49:03] their face
[49:04] and they said the lord he is the god
[49:08] the lord he is the god
[49:11] amen we'll let you be seated this
[49:15] evening
[49:18] i had something
[49:22] very wonderful happened today as i was
[49:25] doing some preparation and and
[49:29] getting some news about my mom and
[49:31] things that were going on and
[49:33] her her body and and the night that they
[49:36] had had in the situation that went on
[49:39] that uh it wasn't able to get much rest
[49:42] and so you know waking up to those that
[49:43] news
[49:44] i went in there and we gathered together
[49:46] with sister ruth and we
[49:48] got on our knees and began to pray and
[49:51] the lord just
[49:52] come down in a real special way and and
[49:55] minister to our hearts and i got back up
[49:57] and i went to my chair
[49:59] and i went to actually begin to
[50:05] send out a text for prayer from the
[50:07] different minister brothers minister
[50:09] friends and
[50:10] just asking god just to call on god on
[50:12] the scene because
[50:14] i for one know god answers prayer
[50:17] and i was reminded of another situation
[50:20] that it happened about
[50:21] i think it's been about eight seven
[50:23] eight years ago if i remember correctly
[50:25] sister adriana was
[50:27] out at the state park and and uh we was
[50:31] enjoying a little time together with
[50:32] some young people out there and i had
[50:34] actually been at home you know
[50:35] remember the story but i'll go through
[50:37] it again for a moment
[50:38] i'd actually been at at home studying
[50:41] for the sunday night service
[50:43] and i was going to preach on a god we
[50:44] could rely on
[50:46] and uh and but just things wasn't really
[50:48] coming together so i told
[50:50] sister ruth i said let's go get some
[50:52] hamburger and let's take it out there to
[50:54] where they're playing that
[50:55] frisbee golf and cook some hamburgers
[50:57] and so we went out there and just
[50:59] as i was cooking some hamburgers here
[51:01] comes adriana down on a ripstick and
[51:04] and the story is you know as she went
[51:06] down she couldn't make the curve because
[51:07] she was going too
[51:08] fast and we went back later she come to
[51:11] the end of the
[51:12] the uh the pavement there she went
[51:16] to a complete stop is that that rip
[51:18] stick would go off the pavement hit the
[51:19] dirt and she went flipping and
[51:21] hit her head up against her still post
[51:24] and
[51:25] we rushed down to where she was at we
[51:27] later went back and
[51:28] measured she went about 25 30 feet down
[51:31] through there flipping through the air
[51:33] and so i got down to her
[51:37] to her side and she was laid up against
[51:38] that post and her head was swollen out
[51:40] there at her temple
[51:42] and uh she was kind of making a groaning
[51:44] sound and i rolled her onto her back
[51:46] real easy as
[51:47] trying to make sure airways was open and
[51:50] and began to talk to her and i was just
[51:52] saying adriana i
[51:53] want you to talk to daddy and she was
[51:54] just making some
[51:56] some kind of groaning sounds and and so
[51:59] she opened her eyes for a minute and her
[52:01] eyes was kind of moving around
[52:03] in weird uh directions and and was
[52:05] pretty much
[52:06] crossed so i bowed my head and i just
[52:08] said lord you know we're here
[52:10] to enjoy a good time with some young
[52:12] people and we're not out here for
[52:14] the wrong reason we're out here in
[52:16] nature and i know that you're here with
[52:19] us
[52:19] and i can declare that and i'm asking
[52:22] that you would come as you did there's
[52:24] brother brandon was out there in nature
[52:25] and his friend was bit with a snake and
[52:28] he prayed and the very effect of that
[52:30] snake was
[52:31] was moved away in a very short time to
[52:33] where he'd go back fishing again and
[52:35] and i said you're that same god today
[52:37] and i need that same god
[52:39] and i watched as those eyes came
[52:41] straight
[52:43] came just perfectly straight and she
[52:45] would say her first words to me and
[52:47] she'd say daddy i
[52:48] i can't see you and i'd bow my head
[52:50] again and i'd say
[52:52] lord i i seen you take these eyes and
[52:55] bring them straight
[52:56] now give them sight and her words would
[52:58] turn to daddy i see you now
[53:01] and i saw god answer very quickly as she
[53:03] would be in him state of amnesia and
[53:06] dirty all over and from the fall and the
[53:08] things that went over and she couldn't
[53:10] remember anything that happened that day
[53:12] she couldn't remember anything that had
[53:13] went on and at
[53:15] all and and uh but just very quickly we
[53:17] called the ambulance and
[53:19] and brother matthew similarly i believe
[53:21] was there and he called brother tim and
[53:22] told him what was going on and
[53:24] the tim would pray and that they would
[53:26] be not one broke bone
[53:28] in her body and and uh so the ambulance
[53:31] took about 20 minutes to get there and
[53:33] as they began to load her up
[53:34] you could tell her mind began to fire
[53:37] she began to remember all the things
[53:38] that had taken place
[53:40] so in very just a short time we seen god
[53:43] turn around a real bad situation
[53:46] and make it for our good and and so they
[53:48] loaded up sister ruth got in the
[53:50] ambulance with her and
[53:51] and they went to the toward the hospital
[53:53] and some of the other brothers brother
[53:55] james lay and their family was there i
[53:57] believe
[53:57] if i remember right and they took some
[53:59] of the rest of the children and
[54:01] and i went in the van following the
[54:03] ambulance and called my father and told
[54:05] him where i was going he said i'll meet
[54:06] you in homework or
[54:07] was going through homer to go to mendon
[54:10] and i put the phone down and i
[54:11] i began to praise the lord and begin to
[54:14] thank him and i was weeping and
[54:15] i was crying and and just i don't really
[54:18] know how i made it to homer to be honest
[54:20] with you but
[54:20] i just thanking the lord for the thing
[54:23] his mercy and his grace and i heard my
[54:25] voice speak
[54:26] and i heard it say what you have seen in
[54:28] the natural
[54:29] you'll also see in the supernatural
[54:32] and we saw god and i got up sunday night
[54:34] and i i actually
[54:36] testified to that and we saw god very
[54:38] quickly move on the scene
[54:40] and now brother philip is here tonight
[54:42] because of that very that very situation
[54:45] that i was going through god would put
[54:47] on my heart to speak
[54:48] identity crisis and i'd preach it that
[54:50] wednesday night and
[54:51] not knowing that that week god really
[54:53] began to deal on his heart to come back
[54:55] to god
[54:56] and if it wasn't the very same thing a
[54:58] man who had went through a
[55:00] bad uh down the wrong path and found
[55:02] himself in a wrecked condition
[55:04] and found himself with spiritual amnesia
[55:06] forgetting who he is
[55:08] but god very quickly bringing him back
[55:10] to who he really was
[55:12] and god did it in a supernatural way and
[55:15] so today you know as i was
[55:17] i was i was praying about that i i got
[55:20] up to go to the restroom and as i was
[55:21] walking through my bedroom i was weeping
[55:23] and crying
[55:24] asking god to move on this situation and
[55:27] as i was walking through there i heard
[55:29] my voice speak
[55:30] amen i heard my voice speak and he said
[55:33] did not give you
[55:34] your sermon already on friday before you
[55:37] ever went through this
[55:39] jesus christ the same the god who
[55:46] answers
[55:49] and i'm looking for his answer
[55:52] and we're here together as believers to
[55:55] see a god
[55:56] who answers by fire a god who can take a
[56:00] moment
[56:00] and change the whole situation he's
[56:03] already done it so many times we've seen
[56:05] him move in so many ways
[56:07] that he is a god who answers he is a god
[56:10] who hears our cry he is a god
[56:12] who hears our prayers amen we would we
[56:15] would look
[56:16] at this and we would we would see
[56:17] brother branham talk about prayer
[56:19] and he talked about prayer is a key and
[56:21] the it's the answer
[56:23] prayer changes things prayer
[56:26] changes things as you would actually
[56:29] hear elijah he prayed now
[56:30] god i've done what you've said i've done
[56:33] what you've instructed
[56:35] now i'm looking for you to move and god
[56:38] answered his prayer amen it was his
[56:40] prayer
[56:41] and he said the prayer is the most
[56:43] powerful weapon
[56:44] that was ever put in control of human
[56:46] beings
[56:47] there is no atomic bomb there is no
[56:50] hydrogen bomb
[56:51] as powerful as prayer prayer can even
[56:55] change the mind of god
[56:57] it did that before amen and i believe
[57:00] prayer
[57:00] is powerful tonight and i i believe that
[57:03] prayer has been lifted up
[57:04] on the behalf of many needs now we got
[57:07] more needs and sister karen we got here
[57:09] tonight that needs a touch from god but
[57:11] we also have brother aaron that's on a
[57:13] trip right now but he's been suffering
[57:14] in his body
[57:15] we have brother ron that's been fighting
[57:18] this battle of cancer
[57:19] we have many other needs in our body we
[57:21] have needs for
[57:22] uh of the baron to give life a
[57:25] manchester
[57:26] candace and sister esther and you know
[57:28] and as i was speaking yesterday
[57:30] to brother michael dexter and as they're
[57:32] streaming as i understand even now
[57:34] he said you know i just felt in my heart
[57:36] he said i feel that same motion that
[57:38] same
[57:39] way that and i told bethany i said
[57:42] this is the week for miracles
[57:46] and i believe we ought to get ready to
[57:48] receive them
[57:49] [Music]
[57:50] amen it's not just an empty phrase it's
[57:52] not just an empty word
[57:54] or i hope so or it may be because i'm
[57:56] going to tell you when i heard my voice
[57:57] speak that
[57:58] every fear every anxiety every worry
[58:02] it left and i'm no longer looking at the
[58:06] situation or the circumstances
[58:08] i'm looking at a promise and his
[58:10] promises thus
[58:11] saith the lord by his stripes
[58:14] she's healed
[58:23] hallelujah you know as we would look
[58:26] here in matthew chapter 7
[58:28] ask and it shall be given how many can
[58:30] say shall be given
[58:32] ask and it shall be given you seek and
[58:34] you shall find
[58:36] knock and it shall be opened unto you
[58:39] and for everyone that asketh
[58:41] receiveth and he that seeketh findeth
[58:44] now he couldn't put this in his words
[58:46] if he wasn't still the same god if he
[58:49] wasn't the god who would answer who
[58:51] would give the answer that we are
[58:52] desiring
[58:53] and to him that knocketh it shall be
[58:55] opened or what
[58:56] man is there of you whom if his son asks
[58:59] bread
[59:00] would he give him a stone or if he ask a
[59:02] fish would he give him a serpent
[59:04] if ye then be an evil know how much good
[59:08] how good gifts to give good gifts unto
[59:10] your children
[59:11] how much more shall your father which is
[59:14] in heaven
[59:15] give good things to them that ask of him
[59:18] hallelujah he's a amen he's a god who
[59:21] answers
[59:23] he answered in every situation through
[59:25] the old testament
[59:26] and he answered in the situations in the
[59:28] new testament he answered just in these
[59:30] in this generation that we have lived in
[59:32] and he's still the same today
[59:35] as he ever was and he's going to answer
[59:38] our prayers he's going to answer
[59:39] there's not one unanswered prayer
[59:43] i know they made a country song out of
[59:44] that thank god for unanswered prayers
[59:46] but there's no such a thing as an
[59:48] unanswered prayer
[59:49] god answers every prayer now they may be
[59:52] answered in a certain time as we know in
[59:54] the book of revelations
[59:56] they will pour out those vials which are
[59:58] the prayers of the saints
[59:59] that couldn't be answered in that time
[1:00:01] but those prayers
[1:00:02] will be answered oh hallelujah
[1:00:06] god always answers jesus said we would
[1:00:09] otherwise
[1:00:10] he would not say ask and you shall
[1:00:12] receive
[1:00:13] seek and you shall find everyone that
[1:00:16] asks
[1:00:16] will receive everyone that seeks will
[1:00:20] find
[1:00:20] everyone that knocks it will be open
[1:00:23] unto him
[1:00:24] that's the only way he said i've ever
[1:00:26] found it that to get anything from god
[1:00:28] is to take his word and believe it
[1:00:32] and stand upon it and not let it go amen
[1:00:36] god will always answer
[1:00:39] and i want to give fair warning to the
[1:00:41] devil you know i got to i was talking
[1:00:43] about the andrew you know this week and
[1:00:44] i
[1:00:45] with andrew spencer and and and he was
[1:00:47] it was sharing our hearts and things
[1:00:49] because
[1:00:50] you know let me let me let you in on
[1:00:51] something that's what's going on here
[1:00:53] the devil hates the supernatural
[1:00:57] the supernatural of god he knows when
[1:01:00] the supernatural happens
[1:01:01] every time he is defeated and so anyone
[1:01:04] who stands for the supernatural
[1:01:06] who preaches the supernatural they're
[1:01:08] going to come under the attack of
[1:01:10] satan and this is exactly what has
[1:01:13] happened
[1:01:13] the satan has tried to as we heard
[1:01:16] sunday he's standing upon it
[1:01:18] writing saying you can't have it saying
[1:01:20] it ain't possible
[1:01:21] healings for another day this is for
[1:01:24] another time
[1:01:25] it's impossible but we're not going to
[1:01:26] back off from his writing
[1:01:28] we're going to stand with not empty
[1:01:30] words we're going to stand with thus
[1:01:32] saith the lord
[1:01:33] and stand there and god will answer with
[1:01:36] fire
[1:01:38] hallelujah as i was talking to him i
[1:01:40] said brother andrew i'm reminded
[1:01:41] of world war ii amen when there was a
[1:01:44] group of men that decided it was a good
[1:01:46] idea
[1:01:46] to go across the pacific ocean and they
[1:01:49] would take some bombs and they would
[1:01:50] bomb pearl harbor
[1:01:52] and they and they would they would
[1:01:53] pretty much lay it to waste and they
[1:01:55] would destroy planes and destroy
[1:01:56] buildings
[1:01:57] and destroy ships and they'd been having
[1:01:59] their way through the pacific and
[1:02:01] they've been taking this island and that
[1:02:02] island and attacking this one over here
[1:02:04] and attacking
[1:02:05] but they made the wrong choice
[1:02:08] it's history they made the wrong choice
[1:02:10] matter of fact when they
[1:02:11] when they finished there they began to
[1:02:13] turn back towards japan
[1:02:15] and their one of their generals said you
[1:02:17] know i'm afraid we have awakened
[1:02:19] a sleeping giant amen and what ended up
[1:02:23] happening
[1:02:24] in that war that was the only nation in
[1:02:26] history that the atomic bomb has been
[1:02:28] dropped on not once
[1:02:30] but twice i know it wasn't a wonderful
[1:02:32] thing and it's not something really to
[1:02:33] celebrate
[1:02:34] but that's what exactly happened amen it
[1:02:36] was war
[1:02:38] and i'm here tonight to declare war on
[1:02:40] the sea on satan
[1:02:42] he has come he has attacked the body of
[1:02:44] jesus christ
[1:02:45] he is attacked he has made his threats
[1:02:47] he has made us boast
[1:02:49] but we're not going to back down to that
[1:02:51] we're going to stand there
[1:02:52] and we have more than our words we have
[1:02:55] more than our own ideas
[1:02:56] we have the atomic the nuclear weapon
[1:02:59] the word of god that's here thus saith
[1:03:01] the lord that will disintegrate satan's
[1:03:03] kingdom
[1:03:04] listen this god is a god of preparation
[1:03:07] he has been
[1:03:08] preparing us for this moment
[1:03:11] when he spoke to me on friday about this
[1:03:13] service and we started saturday having
[1:03:16] to take her to the hospital
[1:03:17] i figured sunday i would be preaching
[1:03:19] but god has prepared us
[1:03:21] for this moment for this time
[1:03:24] to show you i am the god who answers by
[1:03:28] fire
[1:03:28] i am the god who healeth me i am the god
[1:03:32] who saveth it i am the god who's not
[1:03:35] deaf and gone on a vacation somewhere
[1:03:37] but i've heard your cry your prayer i've
[1:03:40] heard your cry
[1:03:41] and i have come down to deliver you
[1:03:46] hallelujah amen we have this
[1:03:50] amen it's something we can stand on and
[1:03:52] many times you may not even know satan's
[1:03:54] coming
[1:03:56] i mean you know he's here but you don't
[1:03:57] know when his attack's going to be right
[1:03:59] you don't know when it's going to happen
[1:04:01] so many times pretty much all the time
[1:04:03] sometimes
[1:04:03] we're just taking unawares we wasn't
[1:04:06] expecting it at that moment or at that
[1:04:07] time
[1:04:09] i thought it was very interesting this
[1:04:10] is
[1:04:13] very interesting today as i was driving
[1:04:14] to church
[1:04:16] this was pretty much an unexpected
[1:04:18] attack that we've been under
[1:04:22] and i'm driving and i'm thinking and
[1:04:24] praying also down to the side of my
[1:04:26] vision i see this snake come out on the
[1:04:28] road had come out on the road
[1:04:30] and i splattered him
[1:04:33] i looked over sister ruth and said well
[1:04:38] i didn't even see him coming but i still
[1:04:41] ran over him
[1:04:46] she looked at me and she said apparently
[1:04:48] he didn't see you coming either
[1:04:54] hallelujah i want to on the devil one
[1:04:56] more time
[1:04:57] i may not have seen you coming but
[1:04:59] you're about to get your hide run over
[1:05:02] because it's not my battle this is the
[1:05:04] lord's battle
[1:05:05] it's not my war this is god's battle
[1:05:09] and apparently you don't know who you're
[1:05:10] messing with
[1:05:12] but you're messing with a son of god
[1:05:15] blood bought and not just a son
[1:05:17] many sons many daughters amen we ought
[1:05:20] to be just like those american soldiers
[1:05:22] when pearl harbor was attacked they
[1:05:24] began to take the attack back to the
[1:05:26] enemy
[1:05:26] and they began to move on this island it
[1:05:28] wasn't even their land
[1:05:29] wasn't even their people it wasn't even
[1:05:31] their kindred but it was but they we
[1:05:34] had such a passion let's drive the enemy
[1:05:36] back
[1:05:37] let's drive the enemy back tonight we
[1:05:39] ought to have a passion
[1:05:41] because it is our brother it is our land
[1:05:44] it is what god has given us
[1:05:45] there ought to be a cry in our heart he
[1:05:47] attacked one of us
[1:05:48] he attacked all of us he attacks one
[1:05:52] message church
[1:05:53] he attacked every message church
[1:06:02] hallelujah
[1:06:04] said brother and i'm talking about in
[1:06:05] moses he said moses was 80 years old
[1:06:09] he said you would might you might think
[1:06:11] he was too old
[1:06:13] for god to deal with yeah
[1:06:16] he was an old man unexpected in his age
[1:06:20] to be dealt with with god
[1:06:22] he was in an unexpected place he said
[1:06:26] but god
[1:06:26] met him at an unexpected age and an
[1:06:29] unexpected place
[1:06:31] in an unexpected way god didn't meet
[1:06:34] moses the way he usually met men
[1:06:37] he met moses in an unusual way and the
[1:06:39] way he choosed them
[1:06:40] chose to meet moses and that's the way
[1:06:43] he answers our prayer
[1:06:44] in the way he thinks best in the
[1:06:47] his way is always right if we ask for
[1:06:50] anything
[1:06:51] and it doesn't happen just the way we
[1:06:53] think it that god ought to have let it
[1:06:54] happen
[1:06:55] then it might don't let it make us lose
[1:06:57] and fall back
[1:06:58] let's ask god stand firm on the word and
[1:07:01] say it's true
[1:07:02] and receive it when he sends it
[1:07:06] that's the way you got to believe god it
[1:07:08] may come disguised it may come away
[1:07:10] you're not expected but no matter which
[1:07:12] way it comes
[1:07:13] we have asked and we shall receive
[1:07:16] god said so and it settles it forever
[1:07:23] now what if moses said what said well i
[1:07:25] pray for god to make me a military man
[1:07:27] and here he comes in the burning bush
[1:07:30] don't make any difference
[1:07:31] how god appeared just so he appeared
[1:07:35] hallelujah and to be honest it don't
[1:07:37] matter how he does it
[1:07:38] just so he does it and he's going to do
[1:07:40] it that's all that matters
[1:07:42] as long as god comes and answers
[1:07:46] and he will
[1:07:50] oh my jacob was caught between two
[1:07:54] occasions
[1:07:55] he'd done some shady things some mean
[1:07:57] things little tricks to his
[1:07:58] father-in-law
[1:07:59] and he was running from him and going
[1:08:01] back home to mama and then his brother
[1:08:03] who had done some dirty tricks too
[1:08:05] you know your sins will find you out but
[1:08:07] oh jacob he got all disturbed and
[1:08:10] perplexed and troubled and he set his
[1:08:12] wives across the little brook
[1:08:13] went to the other side in an unexpected
[1:08:16] place in an
[1:08:16] unexpected time he met god in an
[1:08:19] unexpected way
[1:08:20] what a way to meet god in a wrestling
[1:08:22] match
[1:08:24] amen but it was god regardless if he's
[1:08:27] in a burning bush
[1:08:28] or a wrestling match it was god oh my
[1:08:32] the main thing he came out different and
[1:08:35] he came
[1:08:35] out with the blessing and he held on to
[1:08:38] it
[1:08:40] oh if we could do that if we could find
[1:08:42] a spot
[1:08:43] to where we can see god whether it's in
[1:08:46] his word
[1:08:46] whether wherever it may be we recognize
[1:08:49] that was god
[1:08:50] and you wrestle it out god promised he
[1:08:52] would do it he promised me if i would
[1:08:54] seek him i would find him he promised me
[1:08:56] if i would ask
[1:08:57] it would be given and you're wrestling
[1:08:59] it out if he promised me if i would not
[1:09:02] it would be open and i know his word is
[1:09:04] true you stand there
[1:09:06] and hold him don't let him go
[1:09:09] and see that it's god and he wouldn't
[1:09:12] turn it loose and neither should you
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:19] we're not turning it loose
[1:09:23] he said if you can lay hold your hand on
[1:09:24] something that's real
[1:09:26] catch a vision of the un uh the
[1:09:28] omnipotent god and see his presence
[1:09:32] and hold on to it till god sends the
[1:09:35] answer back
[1:09:36] and the blessing he said my what
[1:09:39] happened when you can see the power
[1:09:41] of a living god something real
[1:09:44] no matter what form he comes in oh we
[1:09:46] might have our own
[1:09:47] ideas but god has a way of sending
[1:09:50] things to us
[1:09:51] answering our prayers he said i believe
[1:09:54] if we could just open our eyes
[1:09:55] and be ready to send it god is ready to
[1:09:58] send it tonight
[1:10:01] well i got a few amens off of that amen
[1:10:04] he said i believe
[1:10:05] if we would just open our eyes how many
[1:10:07] got your eyes open
[1:10:09] that's not what i'm talking about your
[1:10:10] supernatural eyes
[1:10:12] to realize hey we might be surrounded
[1:10:14] but i'm surrounded by him
[1:10:16] there's more force than there is against
[1:10:18] us there's angels of fire lying in this
[1:10:20] building
[1:10:21] there's walking down these aisles each
[1:10:23] and every aisle there's angels with
[1:10:25] swords drawn
[1:10:26] these ain't passive angels these are
[1:10:28] angels waiting for war
[1:10:30] they're ready for battle they've come to
[1:10:32] do business with the devil
[1:10:35] [Applause]
[1:10:38] he held on to it
[1:10:45] we could speak of the children of israel
[1:10:48] the three hebrew children
[1:10:50] been carried away captive down in
[1:10:52] babylon
[1:10:54] they come to the trial it was the
[1:10:57] darkest
[1:10:58] trial of their life you will always have
[1:11:02] trials
[1:11:04] before you have a victory
[1:11:08] if there's no war there is no victory
[1:11:12] the hebrew children down there have been
[1:11:14] brought on us to a spot
[1:11:17] and we feel like we've been brought to a
[1:11:18] spot
[1:11:22] but i want you to understand it might
[1:11:24] look terrible it might look
[1:11:26] bad but it's the right spot
[1:11:29] because it happens to be in this spot
[1:11:31] that's where god answers
[1:11:34] hallelujah the chief three of her
[1:11:36] children were brought to a spot
[1:11:38] where the king had made a declaration
[1:11:40] and was making his
[1:11:41] boats and and that this daring anybody
[1:11:44] not to bow or they're going to be thrown
[1:11:45] in the fire
[1:11:46] but they purpose in their heart we're
[1:11:48] not going to do what that king says
[1:11:52] but where instead we're going to do what
[1:11:54] our god decrees
[1:11:56] and they held on to it
[1:12:01] what's the first thing you ought to turn
[1:12:02] to what should be your refuge
[1:12:05] when a trial comes
[1:12:09] the greatest weapon that's ever been put
[1:12:12] in the hands of mankind
[1:12:14] prayer
[1:12:17] it changes everything
[1:12:22] god let that soak into our hearts it
[1:12:25] changes
[1:12:26] everything it even changed the mind of
[1:12:28] god when he told a prophet go tell the
[1:12:30] king he's going to die
[1:12:31] and that king turned to the wall and
[1:12:33] said lord i beseech you to consider me
[1:12:35] i walk before you with a perfect heart i
[1:12:38] need 15 years
[1:12:39] longer and god's spared his life prayer
[1:12:42] changes things oh my we notice
[1:12:46] that these three hebrew children had
[1:12:48] come to a time they said
[1:12:50] we want a prayer meeting what we going
[1:12:52] to do a decision had to be made
[1:12:54] no doubt they prayed all night long
[1:12:57] no they doubt they prayed and they asked
[1:13:00] time after time
[1:13:02] and they were had to decide what are we
[1:13:04] going to do are we going to turn and bow

[1:13:07] promises of god are we going to just say
[1:13:09] well he didn't really mean it that way

[1:13:14] not backing off

[1:21:41] intense heat of the furnace
[1:21:43] and it killed those men that were around
[1:21:45] them looked like the darkest hour

[1:21:52] to where you can't hardly see the hand
[1:21:54] in front of your face
[1:21:56] and he moves

[1:22:51] a supernatural
[1:22:52] element there something happened they
[1:22:54] couldn't even move the pillow
[1:22:56] and then when they moved the pillar he

[1:23:38] he seen hit christ's head bowed down
[1:23:41] first
[1:23:42] and all of a sudden he gave a big leap
[1:23:45] and out of that chair and around around

[1:24:18] i mean we can talk about mary and martha
[1:24:20] we've been on them for a little bit
[1:24:21] it was a dark moment all hope was gone
[1:24:25] it seemed helpless they'd cried they'd
[1:24:27] pray it said messenger after messenger
[1:24:30] and it just seemed like he's just
[1:24:31] walking away further but he heard
[1:24:34] their first cry
[1:24:39] and it got so dark
[1:24:43] and jesus appeared
[1:24:49] and he come they come to martha and they
[1:24:52] said
[1:24:52] martha the master has come
[1:24:56] and calleth for thee
[1:25:02] oh my i believe he's calling for every
[1:25:05] sick person here tonight
[1:25:08] i believe he's calling for every person
[1:25:10] that's bound with some spirit
[1:25:12] the master has come and he's calling for
[1:25:15] you
[1:25:17] he's the god who answers you may think
[1:25:19] that god hasn't heard your cry
[1:25:22] you may think daddy mama ain't heard it
[1:25:24] you may think that the
[1:25:26] nobody knows about it god knows about it
[1:25:36] you go down hebrew children at the last
[1:25:38] moments
[1:25:40] at their last breath
[1:25:45] we're coming to the last place the last
[1:25:48] step
[1:25:49] and it's into the fire brother branham
[1:25:52] says pardon me
[1:25:56] let's turn the camera towards heaven
[1:26:01] oh my god may the camera be refocused
[1:26:04] tonight this
[1:26:05] this evening it's been focused on your
[1:26:08] last steps and your darkness and all the
[1:26:10] things
[1:26:10] but let's turn the camera towards heaven
[1:26:13] let's turn it over toward pardon me just
[1:26:15] a minute
[1:26:16] let's turn it towards heaven it's been
[1:26:18] dark for us in these last few days and
[1:26:21] things have not been working right and
[1:26:22] things haven't been going right
[1:26:24] seemingly has been getting darker and
[1:26:26] darker and darker pardon me just a
[1:26:27] minute mom
[1:26:28] i'm going to turn the camera just a
[1:26:30] little bit and we're going to look
[1:26:31] towards heaven
[1:26:33] because i remember when heaven came down
[1:26:35] on your behalf over the germany meetings
[1:26:38] and she was battling with that that that
[1:26:41] menstrual problem and
[1:26:42] change of life and and going through all
[1:26:45] those things the elderly woman would go
[1:26:47] through
[1:26:47] and i've watched her go through that
[1:26:49] battle and i've watched her go through
[1:26:50] that battle
[1:26:51] but pardon the camera changed and he
[1:26:54] said the angel's standing by you even
[1:26:56] right now
[1:26:57] and the one who started it is going to
[1:26:59] finish it
[1:27:01] and as far as i know that word hasn't
[1:27:03] changed
[1:27:04] [Applause]
[1:27:06] or somebody ought to rejoice right now
[1:27:09] that word has not changed
[1:27:15] he's still the god who answers
[1:27:18] amen i'm sure our sister atlanta i know
[1:27:20] she had a lot of dark moments
[1:27:21] a large dark time a lot of thoughts to
[1:27:23] give it up a lot of thoughts of just
[1:27:25] saying why don't i just lay here on this
[1:27:26] couch and die
[1:27:27] and just give up but something on the
[1:27:29] inside of her kept pushing her forward
[1:27:31] said nope
[1:27:32] i'm not going to bow nope i'm going to
[1:27:34] church tonight nope i'm going to church
[1:27:36] this morning nope i'm not going to bow

[1:27:40] going to listen to the word
[1:27:41] nope devil you can say what you want i'm
[1:27:43] not going to bow
[1:27:44] and all the while jesus is walking her
[1:27:46] way
[1:27:49] and she showed up on a sunday morning
[1:27:51] and jesus came in the building
[1:27:53] and he showed her i am doing some
[1:27:55] extreme things
[1:27:57] i have done so much in this generation
[1:28:00] it'll be a sin for you to disbelieve
[1:28:03] hallelujah we have seen the lame walk we
[1:28:06] have seen the blind eyes come open
[1:28:08] we have seen god moving from reckless
[1:28:11] ways
[1:28:12] and she came on that sunday morning and
[1:28:15] jesus come by her way
[1:28:17] he's a god who answers
[1:28:20] [Applause]
[1:28:24] i don't know i saw a lot of sister
[1:28:25] mariah's battle and she would battle the
[1:28:28] thoughts and
[1:28:29] and the thinking and all the things and
[1:28:30] the darkness that she was going through
[1:28:32] i wasn't as close as no doubt her mom
[1:28:34] and dad her brothers were
[1:28:36] and they would see her tears and see her
[1:28:37] cry and see all the things but there was
[1:28:40] something in her
[1:28:41] that some couldn't give up
[1:28:43] [Music]
[1:28:50] it's kind of like they went in that
[1:28:51] world war ii thing they attacked a lot
[1:28:54] of islands and took them
[1:28:56] but then they attacked the wrong people
[1:29:02] do you understand the devil attacks more
[1:29:04] than just believers
[1:29:06] and he takes them they surrender
[1:29:11] they give in they give up and he takes
[1:29:13] them
[1:29:17] but what he don't know is when he comes
[1:29:19] against you it's not you're not alone
[1:29:23] what he didn't add into the equation and
[1:29:25] his all of his quail okay if i move this
[1:29:27] way and i do this and i'm gonna come
[1:29:28] around here i'm gonna attack right here
[1:29:29] and this is gonna be the weakest moment
[1:29:31] and i'm gonna take him out with this
[1:29:32] punch he failed to add in that equation
[1:29:35] that c gene of life on the inside of you
[1:29:39] he failed to add that's part of god that
[1:29:42] was placed inside of you
[1:29:43] amen before the foundation of the world
[1:29:46] that seed that was laying on the inside
[1:29:48] of you
[1:29:49] he failed to add in that holy ghost that
[1:29:51] had come and
[1:29:52] germinated that seed and brought it to
[1:29:54] life he failed to add that to his
[1:29:55] equation
[1:29:56] he didn't realize when he started
[1:29:58] tinkering with that one he was tinkering
[1:30:00] with some atomic power
[1:30:01] some nuclear power that wasn't going to
[1:30:03] just sit back and say okay devil i give
[1:30:05] up surrender
[1:30:06] know there's gonna be something on the
[1:30:07] inside that would rise up on a morning
[1:30:10] and she would hear a tape playing and a
[1:30:12] song being sung i can
[1:30:14] i will i do believe
[1:30:18] and she started writing it down and
[1:30:20] nailing it to her wall i can
[1:30:22] i will i do believe i'm not going to bow

[1:33:05] last step
[1:33:07] i can see him stand up his priestly
[1:33:10] robes drops around him
[1:33:11] where he'd been sitting there bloody
[1:33:15] make an intercession upon our confession
[1:33:17] for he died to bring to pass
[1:33:19] everything and anything we ask where is
[1:33:22] our faith in him
[1:33:23] at him in him hat there he stands up
[1:33:26] motions this way
[1:33:27] here comes a big white cloud by him he
[1:33:29] steps on it calls the east wind north
[1:33:31] wind south wind
[1:33:32] and drives him like horses reaches up
[1:33:35] and grabs a hold of a zigzag light and
[1:33:37] cracks it across the sky and before they
[1:33:39] could ever take that step into the fire
[1:33:41] furnace
[1:33:42] he was standing there with a big palm
[1:33:44] fan keeping the blaze off of them
[1:33:48] he was in the middle of the fire he said
[1:33:50] i just wanted to have an opportunity to
[1:33:52] talk to you

[1:33:56] that i could talk to you

[1:34:03] down in there they said three
[1:34:05] o king he said i see four men walking
[1:34:08] around unbound and unharmed
[1:34:10] down in that fire hallelujah
[1:34:14] amen the devil didn't realize who he was
[1:34:16] dealing with he's not dealing with
[1:34:18] just a person upon the earth or some
[1:34:20] washed up person
[1:34:21] or some other illegitimate child he is
[1:34:24] talking
[1:34:24] and dealing with sons and daughters of
[1:34:27] the king
[1:34:28] the seed of abraham
[1:34:31] and if he backed up that seat of abraham
[1:34:34] he's going to back up this seat of
[1:34:35] abraham
[1:34:36] and that seat of abraham and that seed
[1:34:38] of abraham
[1:34:40] oh come on somebody if he backed up that

[1:35:04] it's either to drive that devil out of
[1:35:07] your life
[1:35:15] hallelujah we fail to have time
[1:35:19] with many others but let's bring it down
[1:35:20] to our day
[1:35:23] we know the story
[1:35:26] little colored lady up in memphis
[1:35:28] tennessee
[1:35:31] had a son he went out she tried to raise
[1:35:33] him right
[1:35:35] tried to do what was right and he went
[1:35:38] out
[1:35:39] caught some kind of disease he's laying
[1:35:42] home dying
[1:35:46] his mama wasn't going to battle
[1:35:50] even though his son had sinned and even
[1:35:51] though he had done wrong and even though
[1:35:53] he went back on the way she had raised
[1:35:55] him
[1:35:57] she wasn't bowing no
[1:36:00] that's my son god gave me that boy
[1:36:04] she began to pray she began to call on
[1:36:08] god
[1:36:11] just bear with me for a moment but all i
[1:36:14] know a storm began to form
[1:36:20] clouds begin together
[1:36:25] do you hear me over here in this little
[1:36:28] little shack of a house down in a poor
[1:36:32] little spot in memphis tennessee
[1:36:34] is a little colored lady on her knees
[1:36:36] crying out to god
[1:36:38] and while she's praying storm clouds are
[1:36:41] gathering
[1:36:45] winds are starting to blow trees are
[1:36:48] starting to move
[1:36:49] things are starting to happen and she
[1:36:52] begins to pray and she says lord
[1:36:55] i'm like that shooting my woman
[1:36:58] and i'm not shooting by woman where is
[1:37:00] your elijah
[1:37:03] because she knew jesus christ is the
[1:37:05] saying
[1:37:07] and if he respected a woman before
[1:37:09] because of her prayer about her son
[1:37:10] he would do it again
[1:37:14] that ought to put some faith in our
[1:37:15] hearts amen what did he do he started
[1:37:18] building the atmosphere it started
[1:37:20] changing the atmospheres
[1:37:22] until where there's a plane coming
[1:37:23] across on the sidewalk going a certain
[1:37:25] direction
[1:37:25] and has to come down to land because of
[1:37:28] the
[1:37:28] problems and the situations brother
[1:37:31] branham
[1:37:32] he's a prophet but he don't even know
[1:37:33] what's going on you know god don't show
[1:37:34] his prophets everything
[1:37:36] and he gets out and he decides he needs
[1:37:37] to go mail some letters he goes down the
[1:37:39] post office and he's walking down there
[1:37:41] and he puts his letters in i believe and
[1:37:43] he he starts to turn around
[1:37:45] and says go this away so he just starts
[1:37:48] walking
[1:37:51] he starts walking in his mind
[1:37:55] my plane's going to leave me
[1:37:58] it's going to i need to turn back keep
[1:38:01] walking
[1:38:03] it's going to leave me it's going to go
[1:38:06] where am i keep walking
[1:38:09] and he's moving down he saw turn right
[1:38:11] and he goes down this way
[1:38:12] just keep walking
[1:38:16] what was drawing him a little prayer
[1:38:21] [Laughter]
[1:38:23] happened to be a little cutter lady
[1:38:25] leaning up against the gate
[1:38:27] because she not only prayed she believed
[1:38:29] in a god who could answer prayers
[1:38:32] and she had enough faith in her prayer
[1:38:33] to get up early in the morning and go
[1:38:36] put herself at that gate
[1:38:38] turn down this way he turns and he just
[1:38:40] keeps walking
[1:38:41] in his mind my plane's leaving it's done
[1:38:43] left and it's just over with her
[1:38:46] and he's coming down he's turnt turned
[1:38:49] down this way he turns
[1:38:51] and he sees this lady he says howdy and
[1:38:54] she goes
[1:38:54] howdy parson
[1:38:58] how did you know i was a parson
[1:39:01] how'd you know she said i was praying
[1:39:04] early this morning
[1:39:07] and i pray god i'm your shooting
[1:39:10] i'm like the shunammite woman where's
[1:39:13] your elijah
[1:39:15] and i've been out here waiting for you
[1:39:16] to come
[1:39:22] what did that prayer
[1:39:27] prayer changed atmospheres
[1:39:30] because this woman knew this god answers
[1:39:35] apparently she had some experience
[1:39:36] before in that department
[1:39:38] this god answers i believe we got
[1:39:40] experience in that department
[1:39:42] amen
[1:39:45] how many believes that
[1:39:48] i believe we got experience in a god who
[1:39:52] answers
[1:39:55] she invites him into her house he said i
[1:39:58] never felt more welcome in any place
[1:40:00] i've ever been in
[1:40:02] in that little home so just felt the
[1:40:04] presence of god
[1:40:06] and there's this little this big piece
[1:40:08] of this big boy laying on the bed just
[1:40:10] groaning and moaning
[1:40:12] and she told him the things that had
[1:40:14] went on
[1:40:15] and he said well let's pray he said why
[1:40:17] don't you pray
[1:40:19] and she began to pray that you begin to
[1:40:21] call
[1:40:22] out to the lord
[1:40:25] maybe you've prayed for your boy
[1:40:29] don't give up maybe you prayed for your
[1:40:33] daughter don't give up
[1:40:35] maybe you pray for a situation that's
[1:40:37] around don't give up
[1:40:40] god is still god
[1:40:46] he said i said my i never heard a prayer
[1:40:48] like that prayed
[1:40:49] with such sincerity she got through
[1:40:53] and he began to pray and he said lord
[1:40:56] you know i'm here you brought me to this
[1:40:58] place
[1:40:59] this man has been attacked by this
[1:41:02] disease
[1:41:03] you know the things that has happened
[1:41:04] you know what's taking place
[1:41:06] i ask god that you'll give him back his
[1:41:08] life
[1:41:11] said he began to speak mama it's getting
[1:41:14] light
[1:41:16] it's getting light in just a few moments
[1:41:19] he's sitting up on the side of the bed
[1:41:21] he made his he made his goodbyes and he
[1:41:24] went out the door and ran to his plane
[1:41:26] last call got on his plane and left
[1:41:30] all of that because one person praying
[1:41:40] he's a god who answers
[1:41:43] now we have some needs and i'm going to
[1:41:47] do something very different
[1:41:48] i've had it on my heart i've had it for
