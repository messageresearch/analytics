[26:11] somebody else, but Lord, how does the
[26:13] word fit me tonight? How do I fit the
[26:15] word? Where where do I need to change,
[26:17] Lord? How how can I lay down more of
[26:19] myself tonight, Lord, to be more like

[27:15] that hand. And I just pray that you'll

[36:06] him and saith, Behold the lamb which
[36:09] taketh away the sin of the world. Let's
[36:12] turn to Hebrews 10 and1 says for the law
[36:15] having a shadow of good things to come
[36:17] and not the very image of the things but
[36:20] can never with those sacrifices which
[36:22] they offered year by year continually
[36:25] make the comers there unto perfect. But
[36:28] then would they not have ceased to be
[36:30] offered because that the worshippers
[36:32] once purged should had have had no more
[36:35] conscience of sins. But in those
[36:38] sacrifices there is a remembrance again
[36:40] made of sins every year. For it is not
[36:44] possible that the blood of bulls and
[36:46] goats should take away sins. So we just
[36:49] read about the lamb who taketh away the
[36:52] sin. Bulls and goat bulls and goats
[36:54] should not take away sins. Wherefore
[36:57] when we he cometh unto the world, he
[36:58] says and s he saith sacrifice and
[37:01] offerings thou hast thou wouldest not
[37:03] but a body hast thou prepared me and
[37:06] burnt offerings and sacrifices for sins
[37:09] thou hast had no pleasure. Then said, I
[37:12] lo, I come in the volume of the book, it
[37:14] is written of me to do thy will, oh God.
[37:17] Above when he said, sacrifice and
[37:19] offering and burnt offering and offering
[37:22] for sin, thou wouldest not, neither hath
[37:23] pleasure therein, which are offered by
[37:26] the law. Then said he, Lo, I come to do
[37:29] thy will, oh God. He taketh away the
[37:31] first that he may establish the second.
[37:34] By the which will we are sanctified
[37:38] through the offering of the body of
[37:39] Jesus Christ once for all. And every
[37:43] priest standeth daily ministering
[37:45] offering oftenimes the same
[37:47] sacrifices which can never take away
[37:51] sins. Never take away sins. that this
[37:54] man, after he had offered one sacrifice
[37:56] for sins forever, sat down on the right
[37:59] hand of God, from henceforth, expecting
[38:02] till his enemies be made his foottool.
[38:05] For by one offering he hath perfected
[38:08] forever them that are
[38:10] sanctified. Amen. God bless you. You can
[38:12] be seated.
[38:18] It'd be a I would say a foolish question
[38:21] to ask. Which blood do you want?
[38:24] Amen. But we want the blood that can
[38:26] take away sins. Amen. That can take away
[38:30] sins. A lamb that taketh away, not
[38:33] cover, but he carried them on his
[38:36] shoulder and nailed them to a cross. It
[38:39] was a blood that would annihilate sin.
[38:42] And I want to look at this word
[38:43] annihilate for a moment. It means to
[38:45] cause to cease to exist, to do away with
[38:50] entirely so that nothing of it remains
[38:54] or to cause it to be of no effect, to
[38:56] nullify, to destroy the substance or the
[39:00] force
[39:01] of regard as a as it having no
[39:04] consequence.
[39:06] Another one is to c to cause something
[39:08] such as a particle to vanish or cease to
[39:12] exist by changing it into another form.
[39:17] Amen. And this is what we have in this
[39:19] blood. as brother Brandon would he would
[39:21] compare it to a bleach as as we know
[39:24] what bleach does has been in invented in
[39:26] our in our time and and it was brought
[39:29] to take out stains that was maybe
[39:32] thought impossible to take out before
[39:34] and and it would remove blood or
[39:36] different things uh ink stains or
[39:38] whatever off of garments and brother
[39:40] Brandon would use this as a comparison.
[39:43] And he said, "We now stand justified in
[39:46] the presence of God as a drop of ink
[39:49] dropping into a full tub of bleach.
[39:52] You'll never find the stain of ink no
[39:55] more." Amen. You'll never find the ink
[39:58] no more. It went somewhere and it will
[40:01] never come back again. Amen. That's what
[40:04] you call annihilation. It'll never come
[40:07] back again. And he said, "When a man is
[40:09] truly redeemed, that predestinated seed
[40:12] that sees it and accepts it, his sins
[40:16] are demolished. It's gone. It's
[40:18] separated. It's as a drop of ink in the
[40:21] as as a drop of ink in the blood of
[40:23] Jesus Christ. It'll never be remembered.
[40:27] God forgets it. And now that one stands
[40:29] as a son or daughter of God in the
[40:32] presence of God." Amen. What a blood we
[40:35] have here tonight. Amen. Amen. Not just
[40:37] a blood that that just covers our sins
[40:40] to where every year we're reminded.
[40:42] Every year we have the remembrance of
[40:43] it. Every year we still feel the guilt
[40:46] and the shame of it. Amen. But a blood
[40:48] that can come down upon our sins and
[40:51] annihilate our sins or cause it to cease
[40:54] to exist in the eyes of God. Amen.
[40:57] That's where it's important. In the eyes
[40:58] of God. Amen. To cause it to have no
[41:01] effect any longer upon lives of men and
[41:04] women. Amen. What what a what a thing
[41:06] that is that the blood of Jesus and the
[41:08] life of that blood can come upon the
[41:10] worshipper and cause him to come into
[41:12] such a place that that sin can no longer
[41:15] have an effect upon its life. But it can
[41:18] rise above sin. It can live above sin.
[41:21] Sure, we still have this flesh we war
[41:23] against. Sure, we may make mistakes. But
[41:26] this this life of this lamb can come
[41:28] inside of you and give you the power to
[41:31] rise above that sin or that that
[41:33] iniquity that comes upon you. It can
[41:35] cause it to cease to exist to do away
[41:38] with it so it no longer remains. Not one
[41:42] iota of it. Not one little drop of it.
[41:45] Not one little wisp of it. As you would
[41:47] drop ink into a bleach and you can watch
[41:49] it as you maybe done in a as a science
[41:52] project or some of you done it in Sunday
[41:54] school. You watch that little black drop
[41:56] of ink fall into that bleach and it
[41:58] begins to whirl around and pretty soon
[42:00] it just becomes a wisp of a of something
[42:03] and then it's nothing at all and you can
[42:05] take it and look for it and you'll never
[42:07] find it again. And I I think about that
[42:09] as my sins as I would ask God to forgive
[42:12] me or I would ask God to take my sins
[42:14] and he would take that blackness and
[42:16] that scar or that that issue that had
[42:18] come up in my life and he would take it
[42:20] and he would drop it over in the sea of
[42:22] his forgetfulness and it would begin to
[42:25] move around in that red blood until it
[42:28] took that blackness and it removed it
[42:30] until you can't even find a wisp of it
[42:32] any longer. You can't even find a
[42:34] inkling of it of its remembrance any
[42:37] moment. And we can now stand with no
[42:39] condemnation. And we can now stand
[42:42] justified in the presence of God as
[42:44] though we never did it in the first
[42:46] place. Hallelujah. What kind of people
[42:49] ought we to be tonight? Amen. We're not
[42:51] standing under the blood of bulls and
[42:52] goats and having faith in a woolly lamb
[42:55] and if we picked the right one and if we
[42:57] did everything right. But God came down
[43:00] and he became man and he dwelt in human
[43:02] flesh and he took our sins and he took
[43:05] them to a cross and he shed his blood
[43:08] that that blood might be spilled that my
[43:10] sins can fall into that blood and never
[43:13] be remembered no more. That's a
[43:15] wonderful thing to have faith in that
[43:17] kind of blood tonight. Amen. See this
[43:20] blood it was shed. It was no longer just
[43:22] a covering but it was annihilation for
[43:25] our sin. Hebrews 9 and verse 12 it says
[43:28] neither by the blood of goats and calavs
[43:31] but by his own blood he has entered once
[43:34] into the holy place having obtained
[43:37] eternal redemption for us.
[43:41] Hallelujah. Not just a temporary thing
[43:44] or maybe or hope so but he has obtained
[43:47] an eternal redemption for us.
[43:53] Brother Brandon would preach that day on
[43:55] Calvary and I'm going to take a little
[43:56] bit from that tonight. Amen. It's a
[43:59] wonderful sermon. He said, "The one
[44:01] great important thing that Calvary means
[44:03] to us and the world is that the sin
[44:07] question is settled once and for all."
[44:11] Amen. The sin question is settled once
[44:14] and for all. Men who was found guilty of
[44:17] sin and sin was a penalty that no man
[44:20] could pay. Amen. and we didn't have
[44:22] enough. We we couldn't pay. It was a
[44:23] debt that we could not pay. And we owed
[44:26] this great debt. It was a penalty so
[44:28] great there wasn't any man that was
[44:30] found worthy. Amen. So God would have to
[44:33] come and he would have to create himself
[44:35] a body. A body without sin, a body that
[44:38] would bypass the way men and women have
[44:41] been born for centuries through sexual
[44:43] birth. But it would bypass all of that.
[44:45] and he would create a blood cell and he
[44:47] would put it inside of an incubator
[44:50] called Mary and that blood cell would
[44:52] form and it would begin to add tissue
[44:54] and and bone and matter and it would
[44:56] come out as a little baby and it would
[44:58] grow up as a as a as a young man and be
[45:01] tempted in all things without sin. And
[45:03] and here he came to be born in such a
[45:06] way that there was such such uh uh
[45:09] disdain upon his name and he was looked
[45:11] down upon and he was laughed at and he
[45:14] was scorned. Whose laugh was he taking?
[45:16] He was taking my laugh. Whose scorn was
[45:18] he taking? He was taking my scorn. Amen.
[45:21] Whose sins was he carrying? He was
[45:23] carrying my sins. Amen. But he laid them
[45:26] upon an altar. It was a penalty so great
[45:29] that no man could do it. So God had to
[45:32] come down and do it himself.
[45:36] Amen. It was a blood. It was a penalty.
[45:38] Amen. That could not be paid by men. And
[45:40] this penalty was death. But you could
[45:43] kill a thousand men and thousands and
[45:45] millions had died already and not one of
[45:48] them could pay the debt. We were all
[45:50] born in sin shaped in iniquity and we
[45:53] come into this world speaking lies. So
[45:55] there was not one person born that was
[45:57] worthy. They couldn't find him nowhere.
[46:00] But you know sin, you know, as we heard
[46:02] even last Sunday and and what brother
[46:04] Tim's been ministering, sin was not
[46:06] started upon the earth. It started in
[46:08] heaven. Lucifer and the devil. Amen.
[46:10] condemned creature for his disobedience
[46:13] before he ever struck the earth. Sin
[46:15] began in heaven where God put the angels
[46:17] and so forth on the same be bases that
[46:19] he put human beings on knowledge and the
[46:22] tree of life and the tree of knowledge
[46:24] where men could make a choice. And when
[46:26] Lucifer was given the preeminence to
[46:28] make his choice, he wanted something
[46:31] better than what God had. And it started
[46:33] the trouble and there there but there
[46:35] was a requirement for sin. The
[46:37] requirement was death and Lucifer could
[46:40] not pay the penalty. Amen. Man could not
[46:42] pay the penalty.
[46:45] Amen. And brother Brandon kind of
[46:47] interjects something here that I love so
[46:48] much because I like to remind the devil
[46:50] every chance I got. He's got an
[46:52] expiration date. And he interjects this
[46:55] here. He says, he said, "See, Satan," he
[46:57] said, "I disagree, amen, with some of
[46:59] those who believe that Satan's going to
[47:01] be uh the universal he called him to say
[47:03] that Satan will be saved. He's sin.
[47:06] Matter of fact, he's the originator of
[47:08] sin. His soul sin, he was a spirit. That
[47:11] spirit shall be totally annihilated.
[47:16] Hallelujah. That spirit shall be totally
[47:19] annihilated and there will be nothing
[47:22] left of it.
[47:24] Well, that's enough right there to just
[47:26] stop and have a good rejoicing time.
[47:28] Amen. Because that's that's the word of
[47:30] God. And we can find it in the Bible.
[47:32] Amen. Of where he's going to be kicked
[47:33] over into the lake of fire. Amen. It'll
[47:36] be se be so annihilated. There won't
[47:38] even be a wisp of the devil left. There
[47:41] won't be an evil thought left. There
[47:43] won't be amen mind battles left. There
[47:45] won't be spirits that comes and halt you
[47:47] at night and wants to tear at your your
[47:50] mind constantly. It'll be totally
[47:53] annihilated. Amen. Totally void. No
[47:56] more. No longer done, finished, over
[47:59] with. Amen. This is what the blood of
[48:02] Jesus is doing to our enemy.
[48:08] Hallelujah. When sin struck the earth
[48:11] back in the beginning like a sheet of
[48:12] blackness fallen from heavens, it
[48:14] literally paralyzed the earth. We
[48:17] actually live in a paralyzed earth.
[48:20] This earth is not at its full potential
[48:23] that it should be at. It's going back to
[48:25] that again.
[48:27] Come on now. How many believes that? And
[48:30] it threw every creature on the earth and
[48:32] all of God's creation into bondage. Men
[48:35] come under the bondage of death. We come
[48:37] under the bondage of sickness and
[48:39] troubles and sorrows. And all nature
[48:42] fell along with it. Amen. At one time
[48:44] there wasn't no lion eating a lamb.
[48:46] There wasn't no cheetah chafing chasing
[48:48] after some animal. Amen. But all nature
[48:51] fell along in the same bondage of dying
[48:54] and living and dying and living and
[48:56] dying and living.
[49:01] It paralyzed the earth and we sat here
[49:05] feeling helpless because every creature
[49:07] on earth was subject to it. Everyone
[49:09] born on the earth was subject to that
[49:12] paral paralyzation and it came from the
[49:15] same place where there was no sin. It
[49:17] could not come from the earth. One of
[49:19] them one of us could not redeem the
[49:21] other. It had to come from another.
[49:22] Therefore, when men realized that he was
[49:25] separated from God, he became a
[49:28] wonder. Yeah. He he wept. He cried. He
[49:31] toiled. He He was s in a desert seeking.
[49:34] Amen. Abraham, what was he seeking? A
[49:35] city that was built without a without
[49:38] made without hands. Amen. He wanted a
[49:40] city whose builder and maker was God.
[49:42] There was something in him wanting
[49:44] perfection.
[49:46] There was something in him wanting Amen.
[49:48] life without sin. How many wants that?
[49:50] Amen. How many wants life without a
[49:52] world of sin around you? How many wants
[49:54] life without sickness all around you?
[49:57] Who How many wants life without there
[49:59] even being a threat of sickness?
[50:02] I mean, think about that. Amen. You
[50:04] don't have to worry about your baby
[50:06] getting sick. You don't have to worry
[50:07] about you getting sick. You don't have
[50:09] to worry about how many would love a
[50:11] life that you don't have to worry about
[50:12] death.
[50:14] That you're no longer planning a
[50:16] funeral.
[50:19] Come on, somebody. Amen. You're no
[50:21] longer at a hospital crying out to God.
[50:24] Amen. To come down and heal somebody and
[50:27] give him a few more years. Amen. It
[50:29] won't be no more that'll be all gone.
[50:33] Cuz when Satan is annihilated,
[50:36] everything that he brought upon the
[50:37] earth will be annihilated with him.
[50:40] Therefore, death will be annihilated,
[50:43] sicknesses will be annihilated.
[50:46] I don't know about you, but I'm looking
[50:47] forward to the time cuz we seem to deal
[50:49] with it every every time we turn around.
[50:52] I am looking for the moment when cancer
[50:54] is no longer a word.
[50:58] It's no longer in our vocabulary. Amen.
[51:01] As we speak of someone getting cancer,
[51:03] we see speak of this one dying of
[51:05] cancer. We might talk about it, but
[51:07] it'll be talk of victory. Yeah.
[51:10] Amen. We might mention it, but we won't
[51:12] be no longer in fear or worry or dread,
[51:18] but here he is wondering. This man
[51:22] became lost. He didn't know which way to
[51:24] turn. Just took out wondering, trying to
[51:26] find some way back to that place. But
[51:30] something on the inside of him told him
[51:32] he came from a place that was perfect.
[51:37] Hello, somebody. Does anybody got that
[51:40] feeling on the inside? I come from a
[51:43] place that's perfect.
[51:45] That's what's that's what that that's
[51:47] what's on the inside of me. Amen.
[51:49] There's not a person here in this
[51:51] visible audience today or or he says he
[51:54] says on audience or on the magnetic tape
[51:56] which would be who we are that go
[51:58] that'll go around the world. There's not
[52:00] one here anywhere. But what seeks for
[52:03] that perfection? You get your bills paid
[52:05] and you thinks it's settled and then
[52:08] somebody gets sick.
[52:10] Amen. Then you get the sickness over
[52:12] with and now you got more bills to
[52:15] pay. Amen. The first thing you know you
[52:17] you this is a big old cycle and then
[52:19] your hair is turning gray. Then then you
[52:22] want to go back to being young
[52:24] again. Amen. just a whisp a life is like
[52:28] a vapor just whirling through time and
[52:31] and before you know it it's almost over
[52:33] with.
[52:35] Amen. There's something all the time
[52:37] constantly attacking you. Why? Because
[52:40] sin was let loose upon the earth.
[52:43] Amen. And but in your heart because you
[52:46] seek for that it shows there's
[52:48] perfection somewhere. Right? Because
[52:51] you're seeking for health. If you're
[52:53] seeking for a place without sin, you
[52:55] know it has to be somewhere. It's a deep
[52:58] that calleth into the deep. So there has
[53:01] to be a deep to respond.
[53:04] That's the reason many times today that
[53:06] a sinner, you know, still want to wander
[53:08] and you know a beautiful young girl
[53:10] would cut off her hair to be popular or
[53:13] paint up her face to look pretty, put on
[53:15] clothes to show off her form because the
[53:17] only thing she can find something
[53:19] somewhere to try to find something.
[53:21] Amen. to cause her. Amen. She's looking
[53:24] for perfection. She's looking. There's a
[53:26] thirst on the inside of her. Amen. This
[53:29] is what we're seeing. We're seeing
[53:31] people thirsty.
[53:34] We're seeing a world that is thirsty.
[53:37] They're driven by thirst because they
[53:40] cannot get it quenched by what truly is
[53:42] the thirst quencher. That's right. Oh,
[53:44] they can quench it temporarily by some
[53:46] drugs or some alcohol or some kind of
[53:49] thing like that. But we want an eternal
[53:51] thirst quenching. Amen. And there's only
[53:53] one eternal thirst quencher and that is
[53:56] the Holy Ghost.
[54:01] Human beings have tried through
[54:05] ages. They have wept for it. They have
[54:08] cried for it. They've done everything
[54:11] they know how to do for it. Amen. But
[54:14] they still couldn't find it. Wandering
[54:16] through the world.
[54:18] But then
[54:19] finally one day there came one down from
[54:24] heaven born in a
[54:26] virgin totally different than the way
[54:28] men expected him to come. But he came
[54:31] exactly how scripture said he would
[54:33] come. He came exactly how a lamb would
[54:36] be born in a manger and how how he was,
[54:39] you know, brother Brandham talks about
[54:40] it. He said it was Jehovah crying in a
[54:43] manger. It was Jehovah running down the
[54:45] streets and falling down and skinning
[54:47] his knees.
[54:49] Can you imagine? It was Jehovah. Amen.
[54:52] Overcoming as a teenager. It was Jehovah
[54:55] that faced uh troubles in his family and
[54:58] faced issues around him and situations
[55:01] that that maybe amen was always
[55:03] attacking him and move. It was Jehovah
[55:06] that was here among us 2,000 years
[55:09] ago coming to spill a
[55:12] blood that by one
[55:15] sacrifice he could make all men perfect
[55:18] by one. This is the blood we're talking
[55:21] about. They had offered how many?
[55:24] Millions. And people still had sin. They
[55:28] still had unbelief. They still even
[55:31] David. Even David who was a man after
[55:32] God's own heart. He offered it. He
[55:35] offered sacrifices, but yet he still had
[55:37] the desire of fa in his flesh. And he
[55:39] would still go out and commit adultery.
[55:41] He was still Amen. But he had the lamb.
[55:46] Wanted to do right, desire to do right.
[55:49] And when he was found guilty, he didn't
[55:50] try to hide. He said, "I'm the one." And
[55:53] he repented. He was a man after God's
[55:55] own heart. And he would begin to scream
[55:57] inside of it. Amen. In Psalms there,
[55:59] create in me a clean heart. Take not the
[56:02] Holy Spirit from me. Amen. Renew me,
[56:04] Lord. Amen. What was it? He wanted what
[56:07] you have been afforded today.
[56:12] He wanted the moment that God would not
[56:15] just come down upon an altar somewhere
[56:17] and consume a wooly sacrifice, but God
[56:20] would come down upon this altar and
[56:23] consume this sacrifice and put his life
[56:26] inside of there and his spirit on the
[56:28] inside.
[56:36] Brother Brandon would make this
[56:37] statement. He said, "No man could ever
[56:39] see
[56:40] Calvary the way it truly was and ever be
[56:43] the
[56:45] same. Everything that he desired or
[56:47] longed for is met when he sees that
[56:51] place." It was such an important day. It
[56:53] was such an important thing. It shook
[56:55] the world. It shook the world like it's
[56:57] never been shook before. When Jesus died
[57:00] at Calvary, he paid the sin question.
[57:03] This sinful world had blacked out. Amen.
[57:06] All around men from the presence of God.
[57:09] And then when he died, the sun went down
[57:10] in the middle of the day. It had a
[57:12] nervous prostation. The rocks shook. The
[57:14] mountains wrenched and went ran and the
[57:16] dead bodies bursted from the grave. What
[57:18] did he do? God zeroed in on Calvary. He
[57:21] wounded that animal called Satan
[57:25] forever. Right there on that day called
[57:27] Calvary. Now, he's been more vicious
[57:30] since then because it been brought light
[57:31] to the human race. And everyone knows
[57:33] that a wounded animal is more vicious
[57:36] crawling around with his back broken.
[57:38] But Satan was knocked out at Calvary.
[57:42] Amen. The earth proved it. Amen. The
[57:44] greatest price that was ever paid, the
[57:46] only one that could pay it came down and
[57:48] done it at Calvary. And where when that
[57:51] great price was paid, that was one of
[57:53] the things God required. No man was
[57:55] worthy. No man was able. No man could do
[57:57] it. So God himself happened, came down.
[58:00] What happened? God put back in the hands
[58:03] of man a way back to what he's been
[58:07] looking for.
[58:09] Hallelujah. He He didn't have to weep no
[58:12] more cuz right there at Calvary, he
[58:14] broke the back of Satan.
[58:19] I'm here to tell you tonight, you're
[58:21] dealing with an enemy whose back is
[58:23] broke. That's right.
[58:26] We heard it Sunday. He's lost his power.
[58:29] Yes, sir.
[58:34] The backbone of Satan was broke.
[58:38] What does that mean, brother Timothy?
[58:40] That means the backbone of sin is broke.
[58:44] That means the backbone of sickness is
[58:46] broke. Right.
[58:48] It brings every mortal being on earth
[58:52] back into the presence of God with their
[58:54] sins forgiven.
[59:00] Because in their day, there wasn't but
[59:02] one man once a year could go into the
[59:04] Holy of Holies,
[59:06] right, into the presence of God. But
[59:09] when on that day on Calvary, the veil
[59:11] was rent.
[59:14] So now every man has a right to go into
[59:18] the presence of God. It was death to go
[59:20] in. Now it's death not to go in.
[59:24] Amen. If you don't get into his
[59:26] presence, it's death. If you don't get
[59:29] his presence in you, it is death. Amen.
[59:32] The veil has been rent. Therefore, we
[59:34] have a right to go into his presence.
[59:38] Amen. Back then, they didn't have a
[59:39] right. They couldn't. They had to get a
[59:40] high priest. He had to make sure
[59:42] everything was exactly right
[59:45] or he'd die because he how dare he went
[59:49] behind that veil in the holies of holies
[59:51] where the ark of the covenant and all
[59:53] the things were laid there in that ark
[59:54] and all the holy remembrance of what God
[59:56] had done was put there and he was to go
[59:58] in and sprinkle blood amen upon the
[1:00:01] altar for the sins of the people. Amen.
[1:00:03] But here, here they are still. Brother
[1:00:05] brother R would bring it and he bring it
[1:00:07] like this. He said, "There they are down
[1:00:08] there in the temple and they're going
[1:00:10] into that place and they're there
[1:00:12] sprinkling the blood and meanwhile
[1:00:13] there's the lamb hanging on the cross."
[1:00:17] Amen. And all of a sudden as they're
[1:00:19] sprinkling it, the veil rent.
[1:00:22] Amen. What blood was more powerful? The
[1:00:25] one who rent the veil. Amen. And it rent
[1:00:28] the veil. Amen. Giving us access. given
[1:00:32] you the ability to go in and ask for the
[1:00:35] things that you have need of. Not hire
[1:00:37] get a high priest or somebody else, but
[1:00:40] you can go in and you can ask what you
[1:00:42] will. Amen. You can go in and ask God
[1:00:45] for forgiveness. You can go in and ask
[1:00:47] him for healing. You can go in and ask
[1:00:50] him for things that you need in your
[1:00:52] life. You can do it. Yes, sir.
[1:00:54] Hallelujah.
[1:00:59] God, put back into your hands a way that
[1:01:02] Abraham and Isaac and David and all of
[1:01:06] them were looking for. Amen. You know,
[1:01:09] we don't have to weep no more. The
[1:01:10] backbone's broken. Our sins are
[1:01:12] forgiven. No more can Satan back us off
[1:01:16] from God
[1:01:20] unless we let him.
[1:01:23] Come on. No more can Satan back us off
[1:01:28] from God. He ain't got a right to back
[1:01:31] you off from worship.
[1:01:33] He ain't got a right to back you off
[1:01:35] from things of the thing blessings of
[1:01:37] God. He ain't got a right to back you
[1:01:39] off from the presence of God. He ain't
[1:01:42] got a right to keep you out of the Holy
[1:01:43] of Holies. Matter of fact, it's our
[1:01:45] right to go into the Holy of Holies.
[1:01:48] Amen. To go into the presence of God.
[1:01:50] Amen. He lost his right. He cannot back
[1:01:53] you off from God any longer. There's a
[1:01:55] highway made. We heard about it Sunday.
[1:01:58] There's a telephone there. There's a
[1:01:59] line to glory. Amen. It brings every
[1:02:01] person in reach of that line. All you
[1:02:03] got to do is pick up the telephone and
[1:02:06] say, "God, I have a need. God, I'm
[1:02:09] needing you to move on this situation.
[1:02:11] God, I I have Amen. Hello, somebody."
[1:02:16] Amen. If you had a telephone that get
[1:02:17] you to the White House, how many times
[1:02:19] would you use it? If you knew there was,
[1:02:22] come on. I'm gonna just bring it on. I
[1:02:24] don't know what's going on tonight or
[1:02:25] last Sunday. We had a convention ser
[1:02:27] sermon Sunday. Most of us looked like
[1:02:28] like was a bunch of somebody eating new
[1:02:31] grapes or
[1:02:32] something. That was a convention service
[1:02:34] Sunday. I'm just going to tell you what
[1:02:35] it was. We ought to have been shouting
[1:02:37] and standing up and running the tops of
[1:02:39] these ceilings or something. Amen.
[1:02:42] Because God was showing us some very
[1:02:43] powerful things. And he's once again
[1:02:46] come tonight to show you again. There's
[1:02:48] power in my blood. Amen. If you had a
[1:02:51] line that could get you to Trump and you
[1:02:53] could ask what you needed and he would
[1:02:54] give it to you, how many times would you
[1:02:56] use it? How many times would you be
[1:02:58] picking up that telephone and saying,
[1:03:00] "Mr. Trump, I have a need. I got a I got
[1:03:02] a shortfall of some money. Will you send
[1:03:04] me some over?"
[1:03:08] Amen. People have been they we found out
[1:03:10] they've been tied into the government's
[1:03:12] hand for a long time. Amen. Why not you?
[1:03:17] Amen. But I ain't worried about having a
[1:03:19] line to Trump or any other government on
[1:03:22] this earth cuz their money's limited,
[1:03:25] their power's limited, their abilities
[1:03:28] limited. But what I do have tonight is a
[1:03:31] direct line to the throne room.
[1:03:35] I have a direct line to the presence of
[1:03:38] almighty God. And I can ask what I will
[1:03:40] and it shall be done. It may not come
[1:03:43] when I think it ought to. It may not
[1:03:45] come in the moment that I think it ought
[1:03:47] to be, but God said it. I believe it.
[1:03:49] It'll take place. No matter how many
[1:03:51] devils line up and try to block it, he
[1:03:54] cannot back me off from the presence of
[1:03:56] Almighty
[1:04:10] God. Listen to this. If a man is full of
[1:04:14] sin, it connected him in on the central
[1:04:18] line that you could pick up that line
[1:04:21] and say, "Lord, I
[1:04:23] sinned. Please forgive
[1:04:29] me." We ain't a bunch of
[1:04:31] Catholics. I ain't no
[1:04:34] Catholic that we have to pay for sins
[1:04:36] and pay for repentance and pay for this
[1:04:38] and pay for that. burn candles and
[1:04:40] incense and make sure we give enough
[1:04:42] money to this that. No, no, he gave it
[1:04:45] to me freely.
[1:04:47] Amen. Of course, the devil is gonna come
[1:04:48] and put some price on what he freely
[1:04:50] gave.
[1:04:52] Amen. Just call it what it is. So that's
[1:04:53] what the devil wants to put on your
[1:04:55] blood. He wants to put a price on it.
[1:04:58] Oh, it may not be in gold and silver,
[1:05:00] but it might be in your condemnation and
[1:05:02] your conscience and all those way. You
[1:05:04] done this and you done that, so you
[1:05:06] can't come into the presence of God.
[1:05:07] Amen. That's the time you need to press
[1:05:09] into the presence of God. Amen. And come
[1:05:12] right on in and say, "Father, yes, I've
[1:05:14] done wrong, but will you please forgive
[1:05:16] me?" And that blood will come down upon
[1:05:18] your sin and annihilate it.
[1:05:21] Amen. Listen, when you feel the devil
[1:05:24] trying to come and back you off from the
[1:05:25] presence of God, that's the time when
[1:05:27] you need to press in. Amen. We feel him
[1:05:30] coming in our services trying to clamp
[1:05:32] down and trying to set up on our worship
[1:05:34] and set up on our praise and set up upon
[1:05:37] up on the amening of the word and make
[1:05:39] us just set set. That's the time to push
[1:05:42] in even harder. I say, "God, help me to
[1:05:45] realize that when the devil's trying to
[1:05:47] push me back from the access to the God
[1:05:49] of heaven, when he's trying to come and
[1:05:51] break the bread of life off of me, and
[1:05:53] I'm sitting there like a old bump on the
[1:05:55] log, God, help me to push in that much
[1:05:58] harder. Cuz I know right beyond that
[1:06:01] scarecrow is something good. Right
[1:06:04] beyond that, there's something God has
[1:06:06] for me. And I'm going to push. And I'm
[1:06:09] going to
[1:06:10] push." Come on. If we can get people
[1:06:13] pushing in the right direction, there
[1:06:15] ain't no telling what can happen here
[1:06:17] tonight. What brother had happened in
[1:06:18] brother Brandham's day, he said,
[1:06:20] "Listen, if I can just get faith to
[1:06:22] elevate just a little bit."
[1:06:25] What was it? People get in the same mind
[1:06:27] and the same thought. If we could do the
[1:06:29] same thing, won't it produce the same
[1:06:31] results?
[1:06:34] We feel that blackness trying to push
[1:06:36] into our lives and make us sit on our
[1:06:38] pew and make us deny what God's done for
[1:06:41] us. It's time you rise up and say, "You
[1:06:43] devil, I've had enough of you." Today,
[1:06:46] your head is coming
[1:06:52] off. You're not going to back me up from
[1:06:54] the presence of God, but I'm going to
[1:06:56] push harder.
[1:06:58] I'm going to fight harder for the
[1:07:00] praises of God. I'm going to fight
[1:07:02] harder for the things of God. Critics
[1:07:04] can say what they want. You can say what
[1:07:06] you want.
[1:07:10] It's time we realize what's happening
[1:07:12] among us and we do something about it.
[1:07:18] Cuz there's a blood here that can heal
[1:07:21] every sick person.
[1:07:25] Hallelujah. There's a blood here that
[1:07:27] can forgive every sin. There's a blood
[1:07:31] here that can come down upon your family
[1:07:34] and so rewrite things that you won't
[1:07:36] even recognize yourself in a few days.
[1:07:40] Things you dealt with your whole life
[1:07:43] and cycles you could not break, there's
[1:07:45] a blood here that can break them. Amen.
[1:07:48] When things you've dealt with and you've
[1:07:50] lived with and you've carried all your
[1:07:52] life, there is a blood here that can
[1:07:54] take it all away.
[1:07:59] There is a fountain filled with blood
[1:08:02] drawn from Emanuel's veins where sinners
[1:08:05] plunge beneath the flood and lose all
[1:08:07] their guilty says. You don't have to be
[1:08:11] lost.
[1:08:14] That made me want to
[1:08:18] shout. Do you know how much joy is that
[1:08:21] when you realize you don't have to?
[1:08:24] Huh? You know, you go and you pay for
[1:08:27] somebody's lunch and they'd say, "Well,
[1:08:28] why'd you do that? You ought not done
[1:08:30] that." I did it because I didn't have
[1:08:32] to. A lot of joy in that. I didn't have
[1:08:36] to do it, but I did it because there was
[1:08:38] something in my heart that wanted to do
[1:08:39] it. Right? Didn't have to give you that
[1:08:42] money, but it was something in my heart
[1:08:43] to do that. I was glad to. Right. When
[1:08:48] you realize you don't have to be lost.
[1:08:53] Amen. Why do I not have to be lost? Cuz
[1:08:55] he made a way.
[1:08:58] He made a way out of your chaos. He made
[1:09:00] a way out of your sin. He made a way out
[1:09:02] of your doubts.
[1:09:04] He made a way out of your wowsy, wowy
[1:09:07] woos.
[1:09:10] Hey, that's a wonderful statement
[1:09:11] brother Joel Forny used to use and I
[1:09:13] like using every once in a while. I'm
[1:09:14] going to drop it in right here. The
[1:09:16] devil can get us some of the in some of
[1:09:17] the most wowsy wowsy woos.
[1:09:21] And I'll do it like he did it. Wy, wy,
[1:09:25] wise. Nobody cares for me. Nobody knows
[1:09:28] what I'm going through. Nobody cares for
[1:09:34] me. You know what it sound like? Sound
[1:09:36] like a bunch of message eores.
[1:09:41] Just a black raincloud, of course. Just
[1:09:44] a always happens to me. If it's going to
[1:09:47] happen to anybody, it's going to happen
[1:09:48] to me. Yeah. And Satan's constantly
[1:09:51] putting his blackness down upon us. Hey,
[1:09:53] I've dealt with it. I know what I'm
[1:09:54] talking about. And you'll never get
[1:09:57] through that thing until you rise up
[1:09:58] above it. And you say, you know what? I
[1:10:02] don't have to.
[1:10:04] I don't have to bow down to depression.
[1:10:07] I don't have to bow down to things going
[1:10:09] all the situation that's happening and
[1:10:11] and and I don't know how to handle it. I
[1:10:12] don't know what to I ain't got to bow
[1:10:14] down. What's worth what's it worth me
[1:10:16] worrying about it anyhow? God's got
[1:10:18] this. He's a God who fights for me. And
[1:10:21] if he can't win it, what's the worry of
[1:10:22] me fighting it anyhow? Cuz I know if
[1:10:24] that God can't win it, I can't win it.
[1:10:28] But if I let him fight, Yeah. if I let
[1:10:31] him come down and I'll do like they did
[1:10:33] there many times through the Old
[1:10:35] Testament. And I just praise God while
[1:10:38] he fights my battle because I know
[1:10:40] there's a blood there and it hadn't lost
[1:10:43] its power. It'll still save. It'll still
[1:10:46] heal. It'll still deliver. It'll still
[1:10:48] set free. I don't care what you think
[1:10:51] about it or how you judge it. You don't
[1:10:53] matter anyhow. What matters is the blood
[1:10:56] is still powerful today as it was 2,000
[1:10:59] years ago. That's right.
[1:11:02] If it healed the lame then, it'll heal
[1:11:04] the lame now.
[1:11:06] That's right.
[1:11:09] If it broke unclean spirits out of
[1:11:11] people, it'll break them now.
[1:11:14] I can have faith in this blood. He broke
[1:11:17] the power of Satan. He opened the prison
[1:11:20] doors of hell. That every man that was
[1:11:22] shut up in the earth, fearing that when
[1:11:25] he died, what death would be to him on
[1:11:27] Calvary, he opened those cell doors and
[1:11:30] he let every captive go free. You don't
[1:11:33] have to no longer be torn down by sin.
[1:11:38] Amen. Hallelujah. You don't have to no
[1:11:41] longer be torn down by sin.
[1:11:45] You don't have to no longer be torn down
[1:11:47] by sin. You don't have to no longer
[1:11:50] yield your members to sin. You can be
[1:11:52] honest, just, upright. Satan can do
[1:11:54] nothing about it because you got a hold
[1:11:56] of a lifeline. That anchor in the rock
[1:11:58] of ages. Nothing can shake you from it.
[1:12:00] No winds can shake you from it. Nothing.
[1:12:05] Some of y'all's been through some strong
[1:12:07] winds.
[1:12:10] Hello. We know what we just heard about
[1:12:12] what strong winds will do. It'll take
[1:12:13] roofs off of buildings. It'll expose all
[1:12:16] kind of things. It'll it'll tear things
[1:12:18] that you've tried to work for years and
[1:12:20] try to build for years and try to, you
[1:12:22] know, try to to try to put together.
[1:12:24] Amen. A strong wind will come through
[1:12:26] and it'll tear it down. And sometimes
[1:12:28] men want to give up and say, "Well, I
[1:12:30] just give up. I go build somewhere
[1:12:32] else." But a real man, if he really has
[1:12:34] a love for the place that he's at and a
[1:12:36] love for his house, amen, he'll get his
[1:12:38] hammer and he'll get his tools and he'll
[1:12:40] go back to work again and he'll put the
[1:12:41] roof back on and he'll put the shingle
[1:12:43] or whatever back on and he'll put the
[1:12:45] boards back in their place and meanwhile
[1:12:47] he'll be singing. It'll take a stronger
[1:12:49] wind than this. Amen. To move me from my
[1:12:52] promises. I don't know about you, but I
[1:12:54] like where I'm at. I like that I'm in
[1:12:56] the promises of God. I like that I'm a
[1:12:58] people of the open book. I like that the
[1:13:01] blood book has been opened and I can
[1:13:02] walk all around it and I can pick up any
[1:13:05] promise and I can grab a hold of
[1:13:06] healing. I can grab a hold of salvation.
[1:13:09] I can grab a hold of forgiveness and
[1:13:11] joy. I can grab a hold of they say,
[1:13:13] "Yeah, Satan's wind might blow through.
[1:13:15] It might blow a few singles off, but
[1:13:17] I'll just grab another promise and I'll
[1:13:19] nail it back on." And I'll say, "It's
[1:13:21] going to take another stronger wind than
[1:13:23] this." Amen. To keep me from my
[1:13:25] inheritance.
[1:13:27] Some of you need to put that song in
[1:13:28] your mouth and start singing it. It's
[1:13:30] going to take a stronger way, Satan.
[1:13:32] Yes, sir. It's going to take, matter of
[1:13:34] fact, you ain't got enough devils. Amen.
[1:13:37] To keep the promises of God from coming
[1:13:40] to pass in hearts and lives of men and
[1:13:42] women that believe in the power of this
[1:13:45] blood.
[1:13:47] It'll take a stronger wind. Amen. There
[1:13:51] there's no more you have to wander
[1:13:52] about. There's no more guessing anymore.
[1:13:54] That's all been taken away. The veil's
[1:13:56] been taken off. We've been set, as we
[1:13:58] heard Sunday, on a highway.
[1:14:01] Wonderful sermon. Maybe some of all of
[1:14:02] us just need to go back and listen to it
[1:14:08] again. We walk right. We have walked
[1:14:10] into the
[1:14:11] presence of God, into God's very
[1:14:14] presence. What a privilege it is this
[1:14:17] morning to know you have a way. Calvary
[1:14:20] opened that way to walk into his
[1:14:22] presence. That day was a death blow to
[1:14:24] Satan's power.
[1:14:27] It ended everything. I can see him
[1:14:29] there. There he was Eden's lamb from the
[1:14:32] very sha first shadow that came by when
[1:14:35] Abel by faith offered unto God a more
[1:14:36] excellent sacrifice than
[1:14:38] Cain. He tied a grape vine around his
[1:14:41] neck and drug him up to a rock took a
[1:14:44] rock in the hand for a lance and pulled
[1:14:46] him up his little head back and chopped
[1:14:48] it and hacked it till he's died. And the
[1:14:51] wool bathed with his own blood. He
[1:14:53] wallowed in his blood. It was a shadow.
[1:14:55] But on that day at Calvary, there wasn't
[1:14:58] a lamb on earth, but it was a lamb of
[1:15:01] God that was dying, wallowing in his own
[1:15:03] blood. He was hacked. He was chopped. He
[1:15:08] was beat. He was spit on. He was
[1:15:11] slammed. He was smacked. And everything
[1:15:14] by the world and the blood dropping off
[1:15:16] of his locks. And Abel says, "And now
[1:15:18] when Abel's lamb died, it died speaking
[1:15:21] in a language that Abel could not
[1:15:22] understand. It was bleeding. And when
[1:15:24] God's lamb died, he spoke in a language
[1:15:27] that no one understood. My God, my God,
[1:15:29] why hast thou forsaken me?" It was God's
[1:15:32] lamb hacked to pieces, chopped
[1:15:36] up. He was the very lamb that Abel had
[1:15:39] in mind when he seen the promised seat
[1:15:40] of the woman. He was a lamb that Daniel
[1:15:43] saw that was huge out of the mountain
[1:15:45] without hands. He was a will in the
[1:15:46] middle of the will for the prophet
[1:15:48] Ezekiel. All they had foreshadowed was
[1:15:50] now come to that day. And that day at
[1:15:53] Calvary, they brought in the great thing
[1:15:55] that broke the back of Satan. And sin's
[1:15:58] price was forever settled.
[1:16:01] Satan's power was broken.
[1:16:11] Perfect
[1:16:12] sacrifice was made to make us perfect.
[1:16:18] We can read about Romans 5 and verse 9
[1:16:20] says, "Since therefore we have now been
[1:16:22] justified by his blood, much more shall
[1:16:25] we be saved by him from the wrath of
[1:16:29] God."
[1:16:30] Ephesians 1:7, "In him we have
[1:16:32] redemption through his blood, the
[1:16:34] forgiveness of our trespasses according
[1:16:36] to the riches of his grace." Hallelujah.
[1:16:39] He ain't out of grace yet. He's rich in
[1:16:42] grace. God rich in mercy. 1 John 1 and
[1:16:45] verse 7. But if we walk in the light as
[1:16:47] he is the light, then we have fellowship
[1:16:48] one with the other. And the blood of
[1:16:50] Jesus his son cleanses us from all sin.
[1:16:55] All sin. Colossians 1:20 says, "Through
[1:16:57] him to and through him to reconcile to
[1:17:00] himself all things, whether on hell
[1:17:02] earth or in heaven, making peace by the
[1:17:04] blood of his cross." Hebrews 9:22,
[1:17:07] "Indeed, under the law, almost
[1:17:08] everything is purified with blood. And
[1:17:11] without the shedding of blood, there is
[1:17:13] no forgiveness of sin." 1 Peter 1:18
[1:17:16] says, "For as much as you know that
[1:17:18] you're not redeemed with corruptible
[1:17:20] things as silver and gold, from your
[1:17:22] vain conversation received by traditions
[1:17:24] from your fathers, but with the precious
[1:17:26] blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
[1:17:29] spot and without blemish. We wasn't
[1:17:31] redeemed by silver and gold,
[1:17:35] but it was a greater price. Our friend
[1:17:38] laid down his life for us."
[1:17:44] Hello.
[1:17:45] Is that not what happened? There's no
[1:17:48] greater greater love than a friend lay
[1:17:50] down his life. He laid down his life for
[1:17:54] you.
[1:17:56] Then don't we think we could lay down
[1:17:57] our pride and our will and our arrogance
[1:18:01] and our stupidities and all the things
[1:18:04] that we got oursel
[1:18:07] and lay it down for him.
[1:18:10] Yes.
[1:18:14] He's not asking you to go to a cross, be
[1:18:17] nailed there upon a crucified on a Roman
[1:18:21] cross. That's not what he's asking. He's
[1:18:23] asking you for you to lay yourself upon
[1:18:25] his
[1:18:26] altar and you die to yourself.
[1:18:31] That's the hardest thing for a person to
[1:18:33] do
[1:18:34] because yourself is constantly self.
[1:18:38] It's always self. It's always about
[1:18:42] self. It's always about pleasing
[1:18:49] self. You know, we sing the
[1:18:53] song, I feel like praising, praising
[1:18:57] him. But many times, self is want to
[1:19:00] say, I don't feel like praising praising
[1:19:03] him. I don't feel like praising praising
[1:19:06] him.
[1:19:08] I ain't going to praise him this
[1:19:09] morning. I ain't going to praise him all
[1:19:12] day long. I don't feel like praising
[1:19:13] him. That is self.
[1:19:17] It is pride that raises up and self sits
[1:19:20] there and self tries to govern what's on
[1:19:23] the inside of you. But if the spirit of
[1:19:26] God is truly on inside of you, it's
[1:19:28] going to overcome that thing. And it's
[1:19:31] going to bring it subject to the word of
[1:19:33] God.
[1:19:35] Bring what subject? this self, right?
[1:19:40] We will always have this self until the
[1:19:43] body change. Yeah, you can get full of
[1:19:46] the Holy Ghost and I believe and I I
[1:19:48] preach it that the Holy Ghost gives you
[1:19:50] power, but power over what? Self. That
[1:19:53] doesn't mean self doesn't rise up
[1:19:55] sometimes.
[1:19:57] Self doesn't raise its own ugly head and
[1:19:59] make a mistake or do something stupid.
[1:20:01] Amen. Well, what happens? what's on the
[1:20:03] inside said, "Hey, boy, you ain't the
[1:20:05] ruler of this house. I There's a strong
[1:20:08] man in the house, and he's going to
[1:20:10] bring you subject to the word of God.
[1:20:13] Not to what we think or how we want to
[1:20:15] live or what we want to do, but to the
[1:20:17] word of God."
[1:20:21] It'll bring yourself subject to the word
[1:20:23] of God in church.
[1:20:27] That's why you bring yourself to church
[1:20:28] because yourself don't want to come to
[1:20:30] church.
[1:20:32] Boy, I'm getting all full of self, ain't
[1:20:36] I? I ain't going to ask for hands, but I
[1:20:39] guarantee there's hands in here of
[1:20:40] selfves that didn't want to come to
[1:20:42] church. Had all kind of excuses for
[1:20:45] selfselves not to come to
[1:20:51] church. All kind of excuses. Good, maybe
[1:20:54] good excuses. But if you have the spirit
[1:20:56] of God, it'll bring self subject to the
[1:20:59] word of God.
[1:21:01] If it's not becoming subject to the word
[1:21:03] of God and you're not assembling
[1:21:05] yourself with the believers, then you
[1:21:06] don't have the spirit of God. I don't
[1:21:08] care how much self says you do. This is
[1:21:11] what's the problem. Too much too much of
[1:21:13] what we think is the Holy Ghost is self
[1:21:16] saying, "I got the Holy Ghost."
[1:21:18] Self-righteousness and self uh uh
[1:21:21] worthiness and self, I done this and
[1:21:23] I've done that. I gave my money. I did
[1:21:25] all this. Listen, we ain't worried about
[1:21:27] ourselves. We're laying ourselves upon
[1:21:29] the altar cuz I ain't got any faith in
[1:21:32] this blood right here. But I got faith
[1:21:34] in the eternal blood of the lamb of God.
[1:21:43] Titus 2 and verse 13 says, "Looking for
[1:21:45] that blessed hope, that glorious
[1:21:47] appearing of the great God and our
[1:21:48] savior Jesus Christ, who gave
[1:21:51] himself for us that we might that he
[1:21:55] might redeem us from all iniquity and
[1:21:57] purify unto himself a peculiar people,
[1:22:01] zealous of good works."
[1:22:04] Colossians 1:12 says, "Giving thanks
[1:22:06] unto the Father which has made us meat
[1:22:08] to be partakers of the inheritance of
[1:22:10] light, who has delivered us from the
[1:22:12] power of darkness and translated us in
[1:22:15] the kingdom of his dear son, in whom we
[1:22:17] have redemption through his blood, even
[1:22:20] the forgiveness of
[1:22:22] sin." Revelations 1 and verse 5 says,
[1:22:25] "Unto him that loved us and washed us
[1:22:28] from our sin in his own blood."
[1:22:32] Amen. in his own blood. Brother R would
[1:22:35] take that and he said wash it actually
[1:22:36] means loosed. He's loosed us from our
[1:22:39] sins.
[1:22:41] Amen. Isn't that wonderful? You're if
[1:22:43] you're spiritual minded, did you catch
[1:22:44] it? It It was his own blood that loosed
[1:22:48] us completely from our sin. It wasn't
[1:22:50] human blood. It was the blood of God.
[1:22:52] Peter called it the blood of Christ.
[1:22:54] Paul called it the blood of the Lord and
[1:22:56] the blood of Jesus. Not three persons,
[1:22:58] but one person. As that revelation
[1:23:00] again, one God, that innipotent Jehovah
[1:23:02] God came down and made himself a body by
[1:23:05] means of a virgin birth and indwelt it
[1:23:07] and might that it might be the blood of
[1:23:09] God that would free us or loose us
[1:23:12] entirely from sins and present us
[1:23:15] spotless before him with exceeding great
[1:23:18] joy. Amen.
[1:23:23] Hallelujah. It so loosed us because it
[1:23:26] was a perfect blood. Therefore, it was a
[1:23:28] perfect loosing from the power and
[1:23:31] bondage and defilement of sin. Then the
[1:23:34] loosen is perfect and complete. And if
[1:23:37] it's perfect and complete, there is now
[1:23:39] no for no more condemnation.
[1:23:43] Hallelujah. Amen. Do you realize what
[1:23:45] kind of services we have? We didn't have
[1:23:47] condemnation.
[1:23:50] Amen. If say when when the presence of
[1:23:52] God will move, some condemnation come.
[1:23:54] Well, you did this and you did that. If
[1:23:56] we got really faith in the blood of
[1:23:57] Jesus Christ, he don't remember it no
[1:24:00] more. If you've asked for forgiveness,
[1:24:02] you have been loosed from it.
[1:24:04] Amen. You have been set free from it.
[1:24:07] You don't have to still dwell in it. You
[1:24:09] don't have to still live in it. You
[1:24:10] don't have to still carry it. You have
[1:24:12] been loose from it. That's right. Amen.
[1:24:15] The only reason why you still carry it
[1:24:17] is because you went back and you grabbed
[1:24:19] a hold of it and you put it back on your
[1:24:21] back again. God didn't do that. That's
[1:24:24] right.
[1:24:25] But condemnation come. But who shall lay
[1:24:28] anything to the charge of God's elect?
[1:24:30] It is God that justify or declares us
[1:24:33] righteous. Who is he that condemnth? It
[1:24:36] is Christ that died. Oh yeah. Amen. So
[1:24:39] that tells me Satan has no right to
[1:24:42] condemn us. That's right. Cuz he's not
[1:24:44] the one who died for us. He's not the
[1:24:47] one who paid the price. He's not one
[1:24:49] that paid the ransom. So therefore, he
[1:24:51] cannot be the one who says the debt's
[1:24:53] not settled cuz he didn't pay the debt
[1:24:55] in the first place. But the one who
[1:24:58] settled our debt says there's no
[1:25:00] condemnation.
[1:25:02] You have been loose. You have been set
[1:25:04] free. It is over. It is finished. It is
[1:25:07] done.
[1:25:13] You don't have to be tied down to it no
[1:25:16] more. You know what that blood continued
[1:25:18] to do? We can read about it in verse
[1:25:20] six. He said he made us kings and
[1:25:22] priests.
[1:25:25] So he transferred the power.
[1:25:29] Hello.
[1:25:31] Satan had the power but his back was
[1:25:34] broke at Calvary and he lost it. And
[1:25:36] that blood took the power from Satan,
[1:25:38] the keys to his house and he gave it to
[1:25:40] his bride.
[1:25:42] So now you have the right to call fire
[1:25:45] down upon the kingdom of Satan. You have
[1:25:48] the right to declare what's going to
[1:25:50] happen today.
[1:25:52] That's what a king is. Is that not what
[1:25:54] a king is? A king has power. He has
[1:25:58] authority. He has the abilities. He has
[1:26:01] the rights. Amen. A priest has the
[1:26:04] rights. Amen. To the blood of Jesus
[1:26:06] Christ. He has made us kings and
[1:26:08] priests. Or in other words, he has given
[1:26:10] us authority and power
[1:26:13] that we can use his name. that we can
[1:26:16] invoke the rights of
[1:26:18] heaven. As we bring this
[1:26:20] down, going back to the Garden of Eden
[1:26:23] for a moment, Cain killed
[1:26:27] Abel and the Lord came down and he said
[1:26:29] to Cain, says, "Where's your where's
[1:26:31] Abel, your brother?" He said, "Well, I
[1:26:34] know
[1:26:36] not." Well, he lied. Well, that wasn't
[1:26:38] no big deal. He just
[1:26:41] murdered. I know not. Am I my brother's
[1:26:44] keeper? And he says, "What hast thou
[1:26:45] done? The voice of thy brother's blood
[1:26:49] crith to me from the
[1:26:51] ground." So we find the blood has a
[1:26:54] voice.
[1:26:56] It has a blood voice. It was crying out
[1:27:00] murder.
[1:27:01] Vengeance. Hello. This is what it would
[1:27:04] do when somebody would would
[1:27:06] accidentally kill somebody in the cities
[1:27:08] of refuge. That blood would cry out eye
[1:27:11] for an eye, tooth for a tooth.
[1:27:14] It would cry out and it would scream
[1:27:16] out, "Murder, avenger. Hey, you know, I
[1:27:19] need I need a re restitution for what's
[1:27:22] been done to me." And this voice cried
[1:27:25] out. Amen. But in Hebrews 12 and verse
[1:27:29] 24, Jesus the mediator of a new covenant
[1:27:32] and to the blood of sprinkling that
[1:27:34] speaketh better things than that of
[1:27:37] Abel.
[1:27:39] So, amen. He would brother would talk
[1:27:41] about it. He said, "This blood cried out
[1:27:43] vengeance." It cried out murder. It
[1:27:45] cried out, "I need you to come and
[1:27:47] avenge me." He said, "But Jesus blood
[1:27:50] came down and it spoke better things."
[1:27:53] It didn't speak you were guilty.
[1:27:56] No. No. It don't speak you're guilty. It
[1:27:59] don't call you a sinner. It don't call
[1:28:01] you a loser. Amen. But this blood, it
[1:28:04] cries out perfect.
[1:28:07] It cries out forgiven. It cries out
[1:28:10] healed. It cries out delivered.
[1:28:14] Hallelujah. This blood has a voice. And
[1:28:16] this blood is screaming out tonight. You
[1:28:19] who were once sinners have been
[1:28:21] forgiven. And you have been given
[1:28:23] forgiven much, but you have been made
[1:28:25] perfect by the blood of the lamb.
[1:28:28] This blood is crying out tonight and
[1:28:30] it's saying there's no condemnation.
[1:28:34] This blood is crying out and saying, "I
[1:28:36] have paid the price. You're healed."
[1:28:39] This blood is crying out saying, "I have
[1:28:42] paid the price." It's in the atonement.
[1:28:44] You are saved.
[1:28:47] This blood we're under, it has a voice,
[1:28:51] but it's crying out freedom.
[1:28:58] It's not crying out, "Still a sinner,
[1:29:01] still wrong, still got this, still got
[1:29:05] that." It's screaming out forgiven.
[1:29:09] set
[1:29:10] free. It's finished.
[1:29:13] It's done. It's over. You don't have to
[1:29:16] bear that no longer.
[1:29:22] It's speaking to generational curses
[1:29:24] tonight and saying, "You don't have no
[1:29:26] power over that son of God. You don't
[1:29:28] have no power over that daughter of
[1:29:30] God." It's speaking to cancer tonight,
[1:29:32] telling them cancer, it does not have
[1:29:34] power over a son of God.
[1:29:37] Come on. This blood has a voice and it's
[1:29:40] a powerful voice and it's screaming out,
[1:29:43] "Woman, thou art loosed.
[1:29:46] You are forgiven. You're set free. You
[1:29:49] don't have to live that way any longer.
[1:29:51] You don't have to live under that
[1:29:52] bondage any longer, young man. But you
[1:29:55] can walk out of this building forgiven,
[1:29:57] free, over, finished, debt, paid."
[1:30:03] That is the power of this blood. It
[1:30:07] wasn't the blood of
[1:30:09] guilt. It was the blood of
[1:30:12] freedom. It was a blood of
[1:30:15] redemption. In the Old Testament, that
[1:30:17] lamb spoke of death and sorrow. But in
[1:30:21] this testament, it speaks of
[1:30:24] resurrection and life. In that
[1:30:26] testament, it spoke of death. And this
[1:30:29] one, it speaks of healing. And that one
[1:30:31] is spoke of guilt. This one it speaks of
[1:30:33] joy. And that one spoke of one day we
[1:30:36] will have it. Today we have it. Yes sir.
[1:30:39] It is power. It speaks life. It speaks
[1:30:42] heaven. And the same blood that was shed
[1:30:44] upon the ground that called out for his
[1:30:45] dead brother or called out after his
[1:30:47] brother killed him. The blood of Jesus
[1:30:49] Christ when his brothers killed him.
[1:30:53] Come on. His brothers killed him. He
[1:30:55] could have that blood could have
[1:30:56] screamed the same thing. But that blood,
[1:30:59] it didn't scream the I I need vengeance.
[1:31:01] I need red. I need I need someone to
[1:31:03] come down and wipe things off the face
[1:31:05] of their No, it screamed now.
[1:31:08] Father, forgive them for they know not
[1:31:11] what they do. What a
[1:31:14] blood. What a blood that'll look right
[1:31:18] at you in your
[1:31:21] stupidity, in your ignorance, in your
[1:31:24] wrongdoings, and say, "Father, forgive
[1:31:27] them."
[1:31:36] How can I get this blood, brother
[1:31:37] Timothy? You've got to accept this blood
[1:31:41] that he died for me.
[1:31:47] It ain't good enough to know that he
[1:31:49] died for brother Tim or somebody your
[1:31:51] daddy or whoever. But this God came down
[1:31:56] and became flesh and died for
[1:32:02] me when I couldn't go to where he
[1:32:06] was. I could I couldn't go beyond that
[1:32:09] veil. I was veiled out. He came down and
[1:32:14] he rent the veil. And now I have the
[1:32:16] right
[1:32:17] tonight to go before him and ask him in
[1:32:22] my time of
[1:32:23] need. Let's bow our
[1:32:28] heads. You have a right to go before him
[1:32:33] tonight in your time of
[1:32:38] need. But brother Timothy, I've done so
[1:32:40] much. I've done so much wrong. Well,
[1:32:45] listen. There's still enough
[1:32:49] blood because he taketh away
[1:32:56] sins. In other words, his blood will
[1:32:59] remain until every sin is taken
[1:33:05] away,
[1:33:08] annihilated, finished.
[1:33:12] over.
[1:33:17] Done. You could have sins piled up to
[1:33:20] the
[1:33:22] roof, fill this whole
[1:33:25] building. There's still enough blood to
[1:33:27] take it
[1:33:34] away. You have the
[1:33:36] rights to walk away from generational
[1:33:39] curses.
[1:33:41] because of a
[1:33:44] blood. This blood is speaking tonight.

[2:04:04] be my glory.
[2:04:06] [Music]
[2:04:09] [Applause]
[2:04:13] forever
[2:04:15] until my
[2:04:19] rapured
[2:04:21] soul shall find. Oh, I find
[2:04:27] rest
[2:04:29] [Music]
[2:04:30] beyond the
[2:04:34] Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed.
[2:04:35] Just go sing that song. It's here.
[2:04:40] The
[2:04:42] cross
[2:04:44] away. The
[2:04:50] cross
[2:04:51] [Music]
[2:05:01] my thy wrath.
