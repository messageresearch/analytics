========================================

[Music] Don't let our praise be empty space come abide in this place. Every heart you are transforming. Come and move. Have your glory. Darkness tremble. Mountains crumble. When you draw near to us, you draw near to us. Strongholds breaking, destinies changing. When you draw near to us, you draw near to us. Don't let our praise be empty space. Come abide in this place. [Music] Every heart you are transforming. Come and move of your glory. Darkness trembles, mountains crumble. When you draw near to us, you draw near to us. Stronghold breaking, destinies changing when you draw near to us. You draw near to us. Every life can be restored when you fill the room. You fill the room. Oh angels are at every corner when you feel the room. God feel this room. Oh, everything that's dead comes alive. When you feel the room, God feel this room. Oh, chains will break and demons will run when you feel the room. God, feel the room. Oh, every little thing that we restored when you fill the room. God fill this room. Oh, angels are at every corner. When you feel the room, God build his room. Oh, everything that's dead comes alive when you build the room. God build this room. Chains will break when demons will run. When you fill the room, God feel this room. He's in the room. Jesus is here. He's in the room. [Music] Don't let our praise be empty space. Come abide [Music] in this place. Every heart you are transforming. Come and move. Have your glory. [Music] [Applause]
