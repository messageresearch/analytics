to really touch from the Lord and been suicidal ask her for prayer this morning also it's been in the news quite a lot about the viruses going around in China and the reason why we're speaking about it there's a lot of believers there and just ask the Lord to be merciful on their behalf Amen that God would stay the plague because I'll just say it like this you know news let so much out and there's you know there's cities of 11 million people and saying there's only 56 or so that's so sick or died you can just believe there's more than that going on and so we just know that the Lord though no matter how big it may look or how bad it may look the Lord's more than able a man this blood is still the same yesterday today and forever but it also is maybe affecting our trip that's coming up to Japan there's a lot of the believers from China that was want to be in those meetings and a lot of their visas are being denied and that's really the whole thing as far as from China's being shut down so or just ask the Lord to be merciful to those that are there and gotta just move on their behalf a man you know the plagues that struck Egypt didn't strike Goshen and then because it was a lamb that was there and we have not a lamb today of wool or of a physical blood as far as a lamb that was four feet but we have a perfect lamb it's a lamb that died at Calvary and when he died he paid forever sickness never sinned everything that Amen that could ever be done and so there's plenty enough blood yet today for this need how many would have a need this morning you want to make it known to the Lord that's the Lord to come on amen god bless you let's just pray together amen believers one can chase a thousand two can chase ten thousand this morning as we bind together

those testimonies Lord of the red sea of the man in the water in the wilderness Lord the many times you delivered the children of Israel from their enemies we believe that but Lord we know that was only testifying of today in the hour that we're living in the Lord we don't serve a God of history or a God of yesterday but we serve a God of today and Lord in this building are witnesses of that

miracles there in their midst nor do we know Lord there's no sickness that's ever been known to man that you don't have the blood or the power to heal and we just ask the healing virtues of Calvary would stand between the believers and that plague Lord that you would just have be a wall of fire about them we praise Lord is it trying to affect their meetings in Japan which seem like ah never hand we've been attacked Lord and it's Satan's trying everything he can to block it and to hinder and to keep it from happening Lord but Lord we know that we serve a great God a God is greater Lord than

will just to enter in with us and worship the Lord together and that you will just continue creating an atmosphere in this service that as the word goes forth it can change lives it can heal and deliver because our God is a mighty God he's a warrior God and he's there to fight on your behalf a man the battle is not ours it's the Lord's and I want you to keep that in mind that it belongs to him I want to take just a moment before we begin the word this morning and open up the scriptures I want to I want to just kind of give up just a moment just a word a tribute to brother John LaFontaine who just went home to be with the Lord at the age of 76 many of you will remember brother John he hasn't been here in recent years since he's moved up to since he moved up to northern Ohio where was that Michigan where were they were anyway our memories of brother John goes back to the early days of attending the Michigan camp meetings there and the great times that we have there him leading the songs song service so on like that later he was our first camper at the Louisiana spring camp in 1987 and I think about 1985 they had started a camp in Ohio there was some of the brothers and he was instrumental in that and somewhere during that time just in the early 90s brother John invited by the Herald Hildebrandt and myself to come and minister at a convention there for their church in when he was pastor near petrolia in Canada up in Ontario then later day he became back into evangelistic work and he ministered to us and blessed us with message and song and as a pastor then he went to Arkansas right up here three 300 miles north of us to near Hardy Arkansas and and help that church there as they came and they were able to build a new sanctuary and I was privileged to go and dedicate that sanctuary to the Lord and and then I got an invitation to go and preach convention in New Zealand and I chose brother John as a partner to go with me we traveled together to the South Island into the North Island and as you know brother John he was just a very very loveable man a joy to be with we remember his humor and and we had a lot of laughs together and through his time of illness we tried to keep up with the news of his welfare and prayed for many times in his family and today I just want to say our hearts are saddened as we contemplate the going home with this great soldier of God but we know we live for this day and like many others who's went on before us these all died in faith and together we long for the day when this mortal will give way to immortality and we'd like to send a message to his widows sister Loretta his son brother paul lavond Cain Isaac and Sharon and Jerry and all of the family just let them know that our prayers are with them during this very difficult time we're not gonna be able to be with them in the moral service coz Lord willing we're going to be in Japan and the Philippines ministering there but the scripture says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the Trump side and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on the immortality so when this corruptible shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory Oh death where is thy sting you know grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ if you will just stand with me at this time and we'll just go to prayer just ask the Lord to bless the family and the church there brother Paula Fontaine as they continue their work and as a brother Paul said I'm gonna miss my dad my dad not Pat me on the shoulder after our minister and his son that was a masterpiece a man but you know heaven is richer we feel a little bit poor but we go on and man we dress on toward the mark so let's just pray and that's the Lord's blessings upon that family today Lord Jesus we thank you O God for your goodness to us for your grace that has brought us in these moments of time and you brought us to this day and Lord today as we think of this gallon soldier who was instrumental in so many things and he had a heart for the youth in youth banquets and youth camp young married couples and all the other parts of life that he was such a blessing they honor his many minute his ministry that went even into foreign countries at times Lord I pray that you'll bless now his little wife sister Loretta and strengthen her now I pray Lord you bless the Church of brother Paul and his siblings Lord may they just take comfort in knowing that their dad is there in the new body without sickness and pain and sorrow we ask it in Jesus name for your glory a man a man help me seen this Andrew my [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] to gain you feel that way this morning [Music] [Music] we have walked through treasures [Music] [Applause] there's my [Music] they Oh [Music] there is four and the fear [Applause] is one word I [Music] we hide the mountain [Music] my through [Music] our way there's [Music] we're gonna turn to Revelation chapter 5 this morning for our scripture reading pray the Lord will bless his word as we look into the things of God thank you appreciate the wonderful songs and the worship to the Lord today amen the rejoicing in truth a man is something to be that we can shout about we can rejoice about amen Revelation chapter 5 verse 1 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals there are and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book and neither to look their own and one of the elders said unto me we've not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain heaven seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou wast slain and has redeemed us to God by that blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God king and priests and we shall reign on the earth now turn with me to Daniel chapter 12 and verse 1 we read from there and at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time that people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever amen father thank you for the word today bless it to hearts now in Jesus name Amen god bless you can have your seats we're going to be speaking today on claiming our legal rights and as we do I just want to share you a little something that was said um that I'm looking for a time of a break forth of the Spirit of God in these last days that we're now living in for another surge of the Holy Spirit into the church for a rapture invades us before it comes and everything is setting straight in order for that and I believe we're at a time that the word should have preeminence and I believe that the time it's the time to lay aside our creeds and our thoughts and come back to the word amen and I think that is something that we can anticipate another surge of the Holy Spirit how many would say I would like to have a surge of the Holy Spirit in my own life personally a man of course send the service and this you want to share a few things that are the few little quotations from a brother branham on revival as we go along he said if you want to see a revival started in your it's got to begin in you so that's what revival begins and they again he said just one or two members good members in a church that's really on fire for God will do something for that church more than forty revivals you could have this is the power of the revival in one or two good members a man a good cleanse mental cleanse member set an example with the face shining with the glory of God with sweetness and humility to stand there in the power of God and then then he refers back again in another instance to the meetings in Vandalia Illinois's back in the divine healing movement back in the the early forties that that in one night in the vandalia Illinois's then he walked in the meeting hadn't been in the meeting five minutes and there was such an expectation in such an atmosphere of faith that there wasn't a feeble person around the place a wheelchairs pushed up out and how that the blind were seeing the deaf and dumb speaking and just simply the Spirit of God was present and everybody was healed but he said now that's when you can do something when revival is going on but you let the revival fire got down then you can hardly the people are still Christians but they're not revived into that spirit it's that great atmosphere that does something this is why you know that I I've asked you you know we made the appeal for you to come early and and pray and call on God that we might create an atmosphere somebody needs saving has to be an atmosphere of salvation somebody needs healing there has to be an atmosphere for healing a man may the word needs to go forth there needs to be an atmosphere created and he and he said it's just like a forge and a blacksmith shop you got to get to iron hot before you can go to pounding it on the anvil if you don't you'll never straighten it out and so that means that we gotta fanned the flames and then that's part of your job this morning you know whether it's someone we're singing and worshipping or praying or whether where the message is preached hiya I know we're in Laodicea I know this is an age where that it's rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing then and lukewarmness but I'm telling you we don't have to be a Laodicean and man this bride will not be a Laodicean she'll be on fire for God so therefore when there's must be overcomers in this age so there's got to be somebody Fanning the flames hey ma'am and and of course that's what takes to have a revival is everyone under the heat of the Holy Spirit that brought down the powers of God and a revival move on then that's when prayer meetings are going day and night and every minute everywhere while people wouldn't even leave the grounds and you know again when we're talking about this I think we need to make this very very personal you know we we said well I want the church to have a revival well it starts with you I want to the Bride of Christ around the world to be in revival well it starts with you and it starts with us and so you know III can see it you might say I can see it poured out upon individuals in the upper room for example but as God has poured out his spirit and the infinite out in this last days as he said in the last days I'll pour out my spirit saith God remember no we are Auto everyone have a prayer this morning got poured out on me hey man that you poured it out on the church it's important it out on others pour it out on me and I can hear again another quotation saying God created me a revival let me be the revival letter each one of us be the revival the revival in me make me Lord to hunger make me to church created me Lord that what is needed in me let me from this hour on be dying and more concentrated serving a better servant more blessed of you more able more humbler more kinder more willing to work more looking at things that are positive and forgetting the things that are in the past and the negatives and let me press toward the mark of the other high calling in Christ Jesus hey man again again he says he again talks about revival in eastern seal he said men and women it'll make you stand to your feet it'll make you do things that God wants you to do I don't care what somebody else says about it the neighbor says all that person's lost their mind they pray all night they read the Bible I don't care what they say is what God called you to do or they said well you can't have those old-fashioned Pentecostal revivals he said all yes you can you can have it in yourself and you're the majority and God no matter what the rest of them think so you can have it in yourself whether the world's going to pop whether politics are doing this whether sin has happened in everywhere you can have a revival right in the middle of Satan's Eden and ma'am now again he says what God - my opinion will do and must do and will do in this last day is to find a tool for the harvest and when he's got a he's got to find a tool that's righteous the floor in him farmer when he ghost his harvest he has to have a tool to do it and certainly answer have a sharp sickle or some instrument to thrash out the grain and the harvest is arriving and his prayer was God tickets in your hand and make us bond servants of your love and uses for a tool to bring realization to this sinful cursed world that we're living in today that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and for myself Lord God let me be a prisoner while my brother internment and my friends turned me down I want to be a prisoner to Jesus Christ and His Word that I might be harnessed to his word by the holy spirit to see the Holy Spirit make the Word of God be confirmed by the same things he said would be done I want to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ and of course says we look at this what he's referring to was that Paul after all the scriptures and the training of the scriptures under the the great theologian Camellia and there were this gray ambitions to do something for God and his zeal then that was used to even persecute the work of God he was so zealous and and yet there on the road to Damascus the pillar of fire alight struck him down who was Jesus and said you know you're you're working you're kicking against the pricks you're working against me and he says who are dial or he said I'm Jesus and so again at that moment God took him a prisoner and Paul would call himself a prisoner of Jesus Christ and he would be stripped of his own ideas on the backside of the desert and become harness to the Word of God it would be Paul who would actually give us the the truths of the New Testament and he would lay down the difference between law and grace and I just tell you as I contemplate or where we are and I think about myself McGinn ministering when I was only 15 years old and for all time and I'm coming up on February the 1st which will be 50 years of ministry and and you know I saw as I as I kind of reflect just a moment I'm not melancholy and I'm not I'm not sad I'm not that's not the kind of reflection I'm reflecting upon some of these things to say here's where we are and here's what we need to go sometimes you can't go any further - you know where you're at hey ma'am so we want to talk to you about a few things this morning as we go forward and there will be a lot of a lot of different parts to determine and probably in the in the well in the months to come perhaps more expanding on some of this very things the same thing but I think you know of course we will all have an ambition to serve God and the desire to serve Him but you know sometimes we we actually have to be stripped of our ambitions and didn't you know our ideas and our thoughts that are different from what God's plan and God's Way is and I think what God has been waiting on for these 50 years as for people to be stripped and become harness to the word I think we can look at examples in the scriptures such as we use Joseph and we'll use some Moses and we'll use Paul here and and I think of Joseph in the Bible that he spent untold years of being stripped of his own ambitions and his own desires and his own ideas of how the vision would come to pass and that it had is a little boy where they would all bow down to him and he had to be totally stripped down and then and then taken a prisoner and then then finally they're you know in that moment in that time God brings him out after untold years now of training and and the soul you know we think of the Joseph we think of Moses Moses spent 40 years out on the desert Paul would spend three and like David we won't use him a lot this morning but David you know he he been anointed and he had been set apart the youngest of all his family and now overlooked and and and when they had the all his brethren was called for the anointing of a king and finally the anointing falls upon him but just because the Prophet pours anointing oil on you doesn't mean you're assured immediately in the power and this is something that we forget that we we think oh well we should have been we've been anointed by message and anointed by prophetic ministry and we've been set apart and we have high ambitions and we're going to do this and we're going to do that and we're we're we're going to we're we're going to excel and we got our plans and we got our ideas we even get our own little creeps or thoughts or a little different thoughts or maybe we it ain't a language yet with the word we have to be stripped of it all and become harness to Christ harness to the word a man where we're not pulling our own ideas and pulling our own ambitions around and living by that but we are we are now harnessed to the word and it's that word there that we're pulling into position and so David would do it would be that kind of man that all he would be anointed but then and he would be accelerating positions and then he would be pushed down and out cast and cast away and between the fires then were the Philistines are on one side and David is in the middle and caught in the middle and solids over here seeking his life over there and and David now knowing the anointing that's been put upon him but when's it gonna manifest Lord I know the Prophet told me I know there are promises that are laying in the word that must be realized and we must tap into but you know this is a thing of it is and you know it as we come along you know we got to be stripped first and it's taking a long time to kind of strip out our own ideas you know this mother Methodist brother wants to hold on to his method is teaching and the Baptist wants to hold on their Baptist teaching and Pentecostal there there there Pentecost still teach him but you got to be stripped of everything and be born to do a man and let this message there come that become the preeminent seeing the word become the preeminent thing in your life where you're not all no longer driven by your own ambitions and your own desires and your own ideas and rebuilding kingdoms with your own ideas but becoming an AUSA rendered to the Word of God and I believe that God has stripped away a lot of our own ambitions and our thoughts and our ideas Moses had a lot of thoughts of how he was going to deliver the people he was told by his parents your special child you were born under sign you're an answer to prophecy you know and Moses fried under his own power to make it happen I think there's been a lot of that you know good but God that take him to a wilderness and strip him and make him a prisoner take him in his word it was the white moody that said Moses Moses spent 40 years thinking he was a somebody and you can imagine he did he was a prince in Egypt and he spent then 40 years of learning he was a nobody and then the next 40 years he discovered what God can do with a nobody a man I think that's where we're on the weird starting to discover not with what God can do with the new body hey man I think we we no longer believer to somebody and and and oh we we have discovered and learned but now that we're just so nobody but now we want to find out what God can do with the nobody a man because with nobody God can produce miracles God can heal God can deliver when the church is humble when the church is seeking God when the Turks realizes I can't do this on my own my ambitions will never push me there my ideas of my own ways Moses God took him out of the desert and kept him there for 40 years and stripped him of all this theology and all his ambition and all my get it what a time he had when he could look back and see his failures and that's all he could see is I tried this and it didn't work and it reminds me and and even brother Branham made reference to this about the healing divine healing campaigns and and he said look at the healing campaigns and see what the Lord did a few years ago to start restoring to the sick and so on and ever organization because it didn't come to their organization that they had to get them a healer to and what did it do you know they tried to manufacture you know everybody was with an ambition yeah you know the the Baptist's would you have a slogan back in those times of me and more and 44 we're going to be the biggest and we're gonna be the greatest and and then the others will outrank them and and then so on and on and they become a competition between them all you know I didn't among the divine healing movement you know we we went out and tried so hard to manufacture some kind of miracles I smell to disease or I got blood and.and you manufacture a miracle what they get they got men and such strings then it broke up and some actually became alcoholics and neurotic and got their mind switched all the way back from the real true Pentecostal objective back to making organizations again and which is a cure which again is kingdom building that's we're talking about and what did he do it's LuAnn Egyptian that's all that Moses had to point to when he pointed back to what are you done as a somebody a mom you know he had one man he didn't deliver Israel from from Egypt he killed one new one Egyptian that's all he had the point to was one stinking dead Egyptian and in many ways that's what we can point back to is is you know again whoa what did we accomplish or what has been accomplished and a lot of this just checks members and maybe maybe somebody live true to their life or quit stealing or something and all that's good and out more the chips and Danny's is is one of Jeff's and dad but he don't deliver the people I'm I'm it doesn't it doesn't deliver Israel it doesn't bring them to their promised land it doesn't produce a rapture a man that we want more than church members come on we want to see a people prepared for the coming of the Lord ready to meet the Lord as he promised he would I still believe he's coming back said a man I believe is promised and there's got to be a people that is ready for that but again you know when the blessing comes out on how we must be born again how to receive the Holy Ghost baptism in the name of Jesus Christ all these things instead of people staying harnessed to the word they just started their own denominational theory and so what we have is again in too many cases about the rotten church members who are so full of their organization who deny the very scriptures that are so plain in the Bible a man that they would refuse such a thing they don't want the world to have preeminence in the church but we do I just say it again we do I'm I know they may not permit this kind of preaching but we knew we will preach what the original sin was will preach the security of the believer will preach baptism in its name cuz there was nobody ever baptized any other way that in the name of Jesus Christ in the entire Bible and my will will preach the will preach will word after word because we have been harnessed to this word and we're not denying in it we're not warming loose from our ambitions are gone to do our own thing but let me tell you we have become a prisoner to Jesus Christ and if we just keep in our mind then according to the Word of God 'no sliced day god's gonna have a church and we're gonna be that church he's gonna have a people and a bride without spot or wrinkle we're gonna be that church and man there's going to be a people that are in revival at the coming of the lord we're gonna be that church a mouth we're living in that time and christ makes us prisoners of love his sons and he gives them power he brings them into power John 14:12 the miracles that I do shall you do also and greater than these how you do they become empowered by the king and again verily I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart you will have what you said a man if you abide in me and my words abide in you Oh hallelujah I believe God's got somebody that the word will live in and they will abide in that word and the word will abide in them and when the Holy Ghost don't come and it don't go it stays in it abides we don't backslide mild in the world next week we're right there constant steady believe in God's Word harness to him and yoke to him abiding in him and he in us now just briefly another one to spend a lot of time on this but I'm just kind of just speaking about some of these characters for a moment but there's Joseph who is are so prisoner you know he raised up a young boy he comes in and anyhow a dream he dreams of the the the sheaves bowing to him of his brothers men he dreams of the Sun and the moon the Stars and and his brothers this to be the other stars they're representing his whole family bowing to him you know a lot of times we hear these things and we hear we predestinated we're called we're chosen and sometimes it makes a bunch of stuffed shirt type of people we're the bride we're the elect we're the call we're the chosen we're the people and a lot of times as I said it makes a haughty attitude and a haughty spirit but God doesn't want that in our lives it is wasn't this wasn't given to you to make you a little swell in your head so this is why the God sometimes has to take it kind of grind you down a little bit and make you realize though I said your preps don't I give you a vision don't I give you a word though I gave you a message I mean you need to be stripped down a little bit for your given power but I tell you I believe that we're at a time where the stripping is over hallelujah are you with me now I believe it is a time where Joseph seed says his face I'm there I wouldn't talk about you doesn't a man god bless you welcome back amen but according to that you go but Joseph changed his face and he comes out of prison are you with me he's elevated the power are you with me hey man you know that some things have been saved out for them and there he was now prepared and for all of these years for the vision to be manifested and I will show you I believe we're in the hour of the manifestation of the vision hallelujah but sometimes we'll take a man like Joseph and shave off their wheels and show them they can't just do anything they want to do they've got to rely on God they got a son humble to the word before they can come into full power but God would take him out of that prison and exalt him to the throne so there come a time where all of these men Joseph Moses and Paul they all had to stand upon their calling they had to come and stand take a stand what's these words that I'm using because we're we're talking about a lamb that stood up Michael it stands up we're talking about Joseph standing up we're talking about Paul standing up we're talking about again Moses he stands up empowered and commissioned under pillar of fire and he takes a stand there to claim their legal rights now in all cases all of these men thought there were somebody and they learned they were nobody Joseph the favored son with his dreams and in a slave in Egypt Moses of France reduced to a common Shepherd in median Paul a Pharisee of the Pharisees knocked off his high horse and finds himself in the desert had to be retaught and retained a man boy and Joseph stood up out of the prison he came to be right next when Moses stood up at a million he came with a word in his lips and brought a mighty Egypt down to its knees when Paul stood up and out of the desert he came with signs and wonders and miracles and God's Word opened to him what the New Covenant was about now I'm just going to make a little change here since I built that platform and I want to talk about our message I want to talk about our message brother Timothy I want to talk about your message Church I want to talk to you about your message Joseph comes and when he comes into power he comes with a message Paul when he comes into power he comes out with a message Moses when he comes into power and he takes a stand he comes out with a message and don't get scared I'm not talking about a different message I'm talking about a message of restoration were that we become focused on what our real calling is because we've had a lot of ideas in the past of what it would be and how it would be and how it's all materialized now all come to pass you know I can go through I can go through the literally nothing another hour on Joseph's talking about it his dream and how he did it seemed like it it would be manifesting this and oh oh oh this is how it would be now and now I see and I become a great man in Potiphar's house and my brethren will come and somehow they'll see me as a great man in this house then again but that wasn't the fulfillment then there would be oh I think it still sigh I've been thrown into prison now and and surely in the prison maybe some of my brothers would be thrown in here and I'm the head of the prison now and I wasn't it you see people's done a lot of guessing through the years have a lot of ideas through the years a lot of false leads through the years and yet all of those were leading up to a greater crescendo now let me just stop here for a moment you know we have brother Ron Spencer he's comes from a little town in grottoes Virginia and in this he's pastors a little Church up what's the name of that town Timothy Elton has a little church there and Elton was there Virginia and and of course you know we he's preached our youth camps through the years our camp meetings to the years and we know him from that you know him from that being here with us and many many things we've seen the supernatural that has worked and the Holy Spirit moving in different aspects but on December the 30th 2016 brother Ron Spencer had a dream in this dream I was with him with brother Bisco and we had just finished a meeting when were rejoicing over the accomplishments and the victories there and and this dream people were taking photos of us and this would be fulfilled in Switzerland when I went there I didn't go to youth camp and I went to the Switzerland meetings and we would preach there it was a very sovereign God ordained meeting brother Bisco wasn't even supposed to be there because of illness and so on and God made a way that he was there and he spoke in that meeting as well and so you know but but the dream was showing him there and this would be fulfilled but then the dream changed to a memorial servant service and then this brother Timothy would speak own am the resurrection and the life and then I came to the pulpit and I spoke on the subject of all thou suffer stand and be healed and as I spoke this in the dream I actually addressed brother Ron specifically and acknowledge that acknowledge him that you know that he was presence and I called his name that I want to greet brother Ron here and and an announcement X to him of what I was speaking and then of course um there the dream would am that in the end brother Ron would come to in his bedroom and the presence of God would just come right in and feel his bedroom and he spoke in tongues for over a half an hour and then he he text me the dream and I went back into my my files and looked at and looked at at the time and the time of day it would just be an hour so later that his son-in-law Whitney's husband Davey who had been promised a child would would be crushed with his with his truck crushed up against a tree after hitting black ice he would be crushed in different aspects of his body and especially a broken pelvis and the doctors told him he would never have children and then of course his wife was it had already been told by doctors she would never have children she she was had a female condition where wound was tilted and the doctor said it was medically impossible for her to ever have a child so now the word of the Lord had already spoken that she was going to have a child now then impossible impossible situations arise and Davey was a supper he was a supper but he took that word of promise that was was given and he stood up on that promise that he was healed and then some some months if I could say it uh you know about a year later little over a year later here she comes up with pregnant you know expecting a child it was impossible for this this girl that when she married this boys he told him I want you to know doctor said I'll never have children he said well I'm not marrying your cousin children I'm married because I love you and yet yep God you know so graciously spoke life to that wound are you with me someone who was suffered that was healed that's turn upon that promise just you just hours after that now hours after this wreck brother Ron's mother would just you know would have a heart attack be taking the hospital and Jenner suffering in her health issues you know what would would cause her to UM to have a massive heart attack and she's laying there but the wrong went to her and she spoke these words as the doctor said you know can I help you cannot do anything she said no I'm ready to go and when she said that she stepped out with his life into a new body and England ain't always in one dimension but it's all healing God heals all diseases like I told the LaFontaine family these all died in faith now so again again you know there she moved from there into a new and youthful body and you know I called brother Ron on the way to see his mom and I said you know your son-in-law your son-in-law is gonna stand and he's gonna be healed but your mother is gonna be healed by taking another dimension in just a few minutes she would go beyond the curtain of time and sometimes later III it was in April to 26 that I I felt inspired to take that that little sermon title all that suffer stand and be healed and I preached it on April the 26th 2017 and her home church on the winds tonight I'd take that sermon I preached it six times and you know what one would be too many of them would be in conventions at at the brother Joe greens and he'll some meeting there and spin-down North Carolina brother Kelly Hilda Brown up in Canada over in holland convention across the seas but the island car over in his place and then and then finally the last time I ministered was just an irregular Wednesday night service again for brother Nathan Bryant I preached that six times oh they'll suffer stand and be healed when I'm and this was really amazing when I preached it at brother Kelly's in his convention the night before I leave for the meeting Timothy preaches I am the resurrection and the life then I go and my next sermon is oh they'll suffer stand and be healed you can't make this stuff up Timothy would preach that on the 13th of September before left and I preached it on Saturday night again ed brother Kelly's on all thou suffer stand and be healed in his conviction excuse me it's been a great sermon for me however I come to realize it's not just discernment and that's what I want to just bring to you this morning it's a message and again I don't mean a new message remember it's a message of restoration has been brought by Malecha for and it speaks of healing restoration hallelujah and it's time we preach it like we never preached it before I'm Anna and I just I just want to say you're a brother Ron if you're listening to me this morning or whatever you do listen to it in particular it it took note of you and it said all that separates butter on it I didn't fight him answer all thou suffer stand be healed you know what we're talking about he's that growths found in his lungs and they don't know where it's come from they're doing the biopsy tomorrow but I don't care what that report is I don't care the name of that devil the name of Jesus is higher than ever name and we are witnesses that we've seen every kind of disease and sickness file do that name of Jesus and have to say these laws so I say brother wrong it took note of you know ma'am you're in division hallelujah but I'll tell you I'll tell you again here's the reason it's a message the Bride of Christ to the aegis we have been sufferers they've suffered duty ages we've suffered in our times we've suffered through pains of false doctrines and we have suffered the pains of kingdom buildings and we were men with selfish gain and they sought to the fire and conquer but I'll tell you how suffer new bride around the world wherever you are when you're down in India you I'm talking to you sister Shalom listening in you don't have to be depressed you don't have to feel cast down you don't have to feel left out hallelujah all suffer take your stand of the word and be filled hallelujah let's say I'd say we've got a message we got a message it is now time to take a stand we have separate lovely now we went through ages of suffering there's been problem after problem down through the ages right now to this time right now to this moment but it's a time there is that's a man that comes a time where you come out of the prison you come out of the suffering new man you've went through the through the tire [Applause] [Applause] it's time for this bride to take her stain have we learned are we ready now to be commissioned as we see the spirit move a man we're we're we're right here at the very beginnings of the move of God and I'll just say and that's it the winds of change are in the air you know you know how it is you know when you move from spring or from the UM from the winter to spring you know it becomes restoration our the restoration time we're in restoration I'll I will restart saith the Lord this is his promise to amend time people are you with me a promise of restoration the winds of change during that time [Laughter] hallelujah it continues right out getting water that's the Sun knows how this reason hey man the buds begin the path work forth I'm reminded I'm reminded sitting there in my backyard there's a big pear tree I planted a few years ago and I don't care you may say well spring will never get here it will never come but already see signs have changed I see blossoms coming on the tree I walked out and I see little jonquil stone up it's little is little branches starts little sprouts coming out what's an announced and it's the early signs it's the early signs man so well you know but but I ask you have we got rid of our own ideas are we ready to be the revival to come out at that dormant stage into the full bloom of the promise well the church today is still in general is still operating on since knowledge instead of faith they're going on how they feel since knowledge is he taste smell feeling here so if you hear me use that term that's what I'm talking about and they're they're still going by since knowledge but now we should be a people who look to the unseen instead of what we see around us I was listening to determine the greatest battle ever fought her brother branham tell a dream of his former trainer he he was a boxer who was trained him for think it was 16 professional or 15 professional bouts anyway six-second smith was his trainer and yeah he also had a dream where he was watching Smith fight even fellows that are much younger than himself this is very important hang on yep yep Smith was smashing him down and throwing him out of the ring he kept talking about this old man he said I think he's 58 years old lot of old men in here but that's alright old men the dream dreams and young men see visions and I've even been praying God giving me the visions I missed as a young man so you see you see again he was watching these these these young men these young fellows fight that was much younger and Smith was just thrashing them and doing them out of the ring and the young guys could not stand up against the trainer and then he remarked to his wife and who was standing there by ripples in his church and he said they he said Smith was my first training and then he then he then he would later talk about and he says you know that was my first training the first prayer lines and he was just saying it right there just saying that as he was talking about you know the young guys with their new trainer won't stand up to the old training a man the new ideas of easy believe ISM the new ideas of no paralyzing experience to have the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] you're born again the news that's what a wind brother around the message I bought your new ideas and they don't win they don't win you can't baptize them in you can't pet a man you can't say just have this profession of faith I believe the message in it won't work it takes a new birth and that's not a new birth when you listen to that sermon again greatest battle ever fought you'll hear a common thread the whole thing and that is our training training training he mentions this over 20 times in his whole message is laced in and out our training that we we should have been trained for this hour he was told in that same vision you know which becomes interpreted it's a vision and he's he says it changed from there and I won't go into all of it but he was told there to stay home and store up food and and so you know we got it I just want to say we need to go back to that training we need to use those same kind of fighting methods we need see faith demonstrated oh we can we have elevated doctor into such a place are you with me but doctors without miracles is not true doctor Jesus doctor was released with miracles follow them that believe with science following the battle is now so who will stand that was his whole premise for preaching that sermon he solved the stars in the heaven and they all stay in their course and they all stay in their place and have been there for millions of years but you let a little problem come and you get out of your course and then you let a little storm come on and blow you this way in that way and the soldiers and the heavens are supposed to be cold I just read you that we'd sign as the stars in the heaven they are reflectors are what we're to be on the earth are you with me now and if they stay there courts and the time the trial we got to stay on course steady right there believe it God's Word that's saith the Lord the truth you see God's army is moving forward men of valor men of faith men of power men of understanding you know they don't have to be educated they need to be channels but to be a channel you gotta have your it's cleaned out then we go back around our our training you gotta clean out your alot Diaz and your all the ways and and come to a place that God can flow through you I'm hindered we should have learned by now the doctrine without without power you know they won't work and that mechanics without dynamics will not work and confessions of faith without experience won't produce to Christians and we should have learned by now that easy believe ISM won't work I neither will just emotion and emotion is fine but we want results with it are you with me haha oh yeah I'll talk about it friends is when there's emotion you won't works to go with it hey man you want to see the miraculous go with it I remember the emotion of it when sister Lydia stood and she grabbed her suffering baby Judah with a non-functioning kidneys that the doctors were thinking of removing and she stood brought that child down to the altar are you with me [Applause] we've got a perfectly cute boy let's didn't need a surgery they were gonna remove but it was no good he moved out of his body but God's healing power buddy [Applause] [Applause] I remember the mother wisdom supper Aaron Oglesby big tall man ran down to the altar and surrendered his life to God and if you think I'm getting redundant I'm reminded you of some things I'm reminding you this is our message it is a message of restoration I remember the emotion of it when that sister little sister Karen my wife stood on the promise there with a brain bleed this big doctor said it don't look hopeful senator specialist and there the Holy Spirit moving and I said should be and I see you tonight the Mars should be in her own room they're not then the next day should be at home but you know sometimes you don't understand that the miracles happen in the midst of healing that healing is a process ma'am a man at that same time little drew there are a baby you know this but I'm telling it again a man a little bug rude but born with a deformed hip the doctor is sterile were very concerned about it in the Children's Hospital give him that a County at night he hears now he's now 18 months old never stood never never could take a step you know he was he was a little crippled boy and down there my daughter walks in the room at the floor at the foot of the bed the sufferer with blind eyes clearly [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let me tell you a little more of it some things you don't even know maybe some things I've never told some things I need to tell because I'm getting questions about it let me talk about it for a minute I remember the emotion of that following wins tonight after that happened for sister Karen I died you know she's still dealing like said healing as many times as a process in the miracle had happened her eyesight was coming back her spirits was lifted things were changing the winds of change were happening and I announcer I just helped move to God we're gonna have a prayer line on winds tonight and I started a brother Wayne Lawson was here at that time and and he preached that night and he we prayed together and sister Karen was still in the process of being healing healed although there had been miracles already happened she was in my office laying in her in a little recliner or chair stuff Karen and and when I saw the Spirit of God moving I went really quickly and got that sufferer who was still having high blood pressure issues and bad just terrible headaches and that week and tottery suffer every month was led there and we we prayed with her in the prayer line and her hands went up oh man and she was healed stood up to midnight then weather hallelujah the suffering was over no more bed for her no more blood pressure no more headaches there was a message that the suburbs are going to be restored hallelujah a man she was to midnight praising God now some people have asked me I got a letter and honestly the gal wasn't too critical he just sent me a website were Satanists wear rings on their middle finger so that wasn't too critical and wondered why IRA wore a ring well it's not cuz I'm effeminate not cuz I'm a devil worshiper it's not cuz I'm trying to show wealth so why do you wear that ring brother Tim well I'll tell you when Karen and I got married in 1975 the only ring I could afford for her was a 98 dollar ring her her dad asked me where did you get that from a gum machine the best we could do I thought it was a nice ring she was 17 I was 21 she bought me her parents actually bought mine this one on this hand for $48 just a little simple gold band by the time of our 25th anniversary you know and somewhere around that time my ring hats been so worn until it broke and she wanted to buy me another one and and and so we went and bought one you know it was more expensive than the other one but you know times had changed it wasn't even close to $1,000 it was still a very what they call him a cheap ring and and you know I it wasn't comfortable I put it on the finger and you roll around and dig into my finger and it wasn't comfortable and I didn't I didn't like it it irritated my finger so I went to the I went to the to a jeweler with my old ring and I said here can you fix this and they weld it back together and I put that ring back on I saw my original ring that feels so good and I took this and put it in a box and it's not there for years my wife had a brain bleed blinded her eyes took away her peripheral vision you people don't know how close that I come to losing my sweetheart other people had that same thing become a vegetable and died from it and so she had the brain bleed and it blinded her eyes and God healed and restored her eyes as I just told you in the testimony and after the brain believed it was due to the high blood pressure brought on by tremendous and emotional battle due to menopause she still had emotional battles with menopause for months outdoors it would be in Germany that I would feel led to go to to Germany and and speak in the meeting and it was in the Germany meetings that brother Ron also flew in for part of that meeting and as he was speaking he walked down the aisle and he said and you you just don't understand all of the dynamics that was going on you don't understand the turmoil of things that was going on you don't think think of the hours that I was there with ministers with different opinions and different things and certain things out and taking them to task on some of their stuff you know a lot of times you don't you don't see me in that mode but I know how to use the sword sometime I cut and sometime I spank with it but after all I've been along around the block a few times you don't maybe don't think of yourself as an elder but everybody else does because the most of them are younger than me so as I was dealing with some of this my wife was nervous and she was afraid and all of that and she went to room and she's crying all night until I was 2 in the morning coming in and don't you even question that yes I was victorious what do you think and I walk in the room and she's a basket case and I have to pray with her for some time until we finally give us sleep in the wee hours of the morning and that next day but the rod wasn't even there at that time the next day he comes in and he walks down the aisle and he pulls her out of the aisle he said sister Karen God healed you of that brain bleed and he delivered you of that blindness but said this God that we served then he started to work he's going to finish it and then he pulled her out and he prayed for her she stood I'm trying to get something to you sister it was an emotional moment from that moment she never had to have another hormone pill she was a man and she claimed her redemptive rights are you with me now I remember the emotion of the night same night of that prayer line when Justin came running to the church come to running down the aisles in his pajamas a wayward boy living out in sin you need anyone just noise and shouting it was God changing the life but that might have supper the man who had suffered in sin have a family that was suffering the whole family reunited and healed and delivered I'm trying to get something to your church man it may come with emotion but there's more than just some emotion you across the world you see the emotion but a lot of times you don't see what God's doing but I was you to understand there's more than emotion going on that's the power of God bringing people to stand on a promise happy healed I remember that emotion of the prayer line to when little Jed who had so many warts on his body a man about a five or six year old boy so many warts on his body the doctors had burned out nearly a hundred off of them and couldn't burn them all and he said you'll have to come back for a follow-up burned can you imagine the suffering of that child so many warts over his body but after that prayer line oh yeah it was an emotional moment but after meeting God after standing on the promise of after eyes and hallelujah had taken his position where our momma said we ain't suffering anymore we're not putting up with this anymore our suffering today is over hallelujah and God healed that boy without another side every bit of disappeared into water left his body hallelujah oh yeah I remember clearly the emotion of that morning when I was preaching on the revealing of sons some of you looking in on our services look over and see a little sister run around the aisle this morning because of what God's done in her life you don't know maybe what God's done and you just say that's emotion that was more than emotion but it's okay to be emotional don't you get happy when God gives you something we've got took this little woman that was dying with cancer a man that had it in her lungs are you with me somebody with me a man in here she ran around the building you got a glimpse up at this morning with long hair she football-headed when she come out of that mezzanine and run around this building just like that Oh God was revealing son that we were living in Bible days with Bible doctrine with Bible truth but for restoration she took that person for himself looks like you did the other day when that spirit of fear left it you don't have to fear anymore [Applause] hallelujah don't get upset cuz I slobbered on the pulpit I'm eatin Cobra oh yeah I don't know you wasn't on the pulpit any weights on the floor hallelu praise the Lord a man but when that suffer who had suffered now for well over a year doctors didn't know and then doctors find the name to it but did it matter that the doctors found a name hello did it matter that it was a fearsome giant [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] he's been a personal personal Savior personal deliverer oh yeah I remember the emotion of the prayer line that the sufferer Mariah threw it to her stand and came with hairpin she wanted to wear and a little bald-headed girl who alopecia I'm an incurable disease had taken away her hair her glory a man and she wanted to wear her hair pins and you want me to be afraid of emotion you want me to be afraid of rejoicing man you wanna heal I tell you already I've been stripped of the ambition if I ever thought about being the popular preacher and I'm afraid that you might rejoice and embarrass me I'll sing Jonathan James Latin song [Applause]
