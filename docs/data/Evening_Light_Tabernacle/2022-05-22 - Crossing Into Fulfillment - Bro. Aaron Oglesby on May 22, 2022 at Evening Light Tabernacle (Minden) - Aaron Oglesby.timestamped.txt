[40:39] excellency of dignity and the excellency
[40:41] of power
[40:43] unstable as water thou shalt not excel
[40:46] because thou went us up to thy father's
[40:48] bed then defilest thou it he went up to
[40:51] my couch

[40:54] of cruelty are in their habitations
[40:57] oh my soul come not thou into their
[41:00] secret unto their assembly mine honor be
[41:02] not thou united for in their anger they
[41:05] slew a man and in their self-will they
[41:07] dig down a wall
[41:08] curse be their anger for it was fierce
[41:10] in their wrath for it was cruel i will
[41:12] divide them in jacob and scatter them in
[41:14] israel

[41:18] shall praise thy hand shall be in the
[41:20] neck of thine enemies thy father's
[41:22] children shall bow down before thee

[41:28] son thou art gone up he stooped down he
[41:30] couched as a lion and as an old line who
[41:33] shall rise him up the scepter shall not
[41:36] depart from judah
[41:38] nor a lawgiver from between his feet
[41:40] unto shiloh come and unto him shall the
[41:43] gathering of the people be
[41:44] binding his foe unto the vine and his
[41:47] asses colt unto the choice vine he
[41:49] washed his garments in wine and his
[41:51] clothes in the blood of grapes he shall
[41:54] be red with wine and his teeth white
[41:56] with milk zebulun shall dwell at the
[41:59] haven of the sea and he shall be before
[42:01] a haven of ships and his brothers shall
[42:03] be undeside on
[42:04] is a car is a strong ass couching down
[42:07] between two burdens and he saw that rest
[42:10] was good in the land that it was
[42:12] pleasant and bowed his shoulder to bear
[42:15] and became a servant unto tribute
[42:17] dan shall judge his people as one of the
[42:19] tribes of israel dan shall be a serpent
[42:22] by the way an adder in the path that
[42:24] biteth the horse's heels so that his
[42:26] riders shall fall backward i have waited
[42:29] for thy salvation o lord
[42:31] gad a troop shall overcome him but he
[42:34] shall overcome at the last
[42:37] amen i pray god will add his blessing to
[42:39] the word as you have your seats
[42:44] i want to look
[42:45] briefly at one other scripture
[42:48] matthew 1 and verse 22.
[42:53] it is incomplete in a sense that it goes
[42:56] into the 23rd verse but i'm only going
[42:58] to read this this portion
[43:00] it says now all of this was done
[43:02] that it might be fulfilled which was
[43:04] spoken of the lord by the prophet saying
[43:09] brother branham says the spirit left him
[43:11] in the garden of gethsemane
[43:13] he had to die a man remember friends he
[43:16] didn't have to do that that was god
[43:18] god anointed that flesh which was human
[43:20] flesh if he had went up there as god
[43:23] he'd have never died that kind of death
[43:25] can't kill god but he didn't have to do
[43:28] it but remember he went there with you
[43:30] in him see god had never separated the
[43:33] bride from the groom yet so when god
[43:35] looked down upon the body of christ he
[43:37] saw both male and female it was all
[43:40] redeemed in that one body see they are
[43:43] one same same word same word spoke of
[43:47] the groom speaks of the bride hallelujah
[43:51] that right there ought to give us
[43:53] something to be excited about this
[43:54] morning i tell you right now before we
[43:56] even get going i'm looking for god to
[43:58] move this morning you know
[44:00] brother jason sang about being in the
[44:02] valley it seemed like the valley all hit
[44:04] all at once this morning woke up with
[44:06] the roof leaking and water coming into
[44:08] my bathroom and i said well we're going
[44:10] to have a good time today in church
[44:13] amen so we're just going to get right
[44:14] into it looking back at matthew 1
[44:17] verse 22 where we read from it's a
[44:20] phrase right in the middle of the verse
[44:22] here in matthew that strikes me and i've
[44:24] actually preached specifically on that
[44:26] phrase before and it says that it might
[44:29] be
[44:30] fulfilled now what i want to speak to
[44:32] you on this morning is crossing into
[44:35] fulfillment crossing into fulfillment
[44:38] and right there it says that it might be
[44:41] fulfilled it says this phrase in the
[44:43] bible 11 times now there's a lot of
[44:46] different times way more than 11 that we
[44:47] see fulfillment in the scriptures but
[44:49] specifically in the bible 11 times it
[44:52] says that it might be fulfilled and it's
[44:56] always a reference to different events
[44:57] taking place whether it's a king rising
[45:00] up or a specific thing that happened to
[45:02] jesus on the cross or joseph and mary
[45:05] having to go down into egypt that the
[45:07] scripture might be fulfilled that out of
[45:09] egypt i have called my son there's many
[45:11] different examples like this and it's a
[45:14] phrase that says no matter what god's
[45:17] word is going to come to pass
[45:20] no matter what no matter who he has to
[45:21] move no matter what he has to have rise
[45:24] up no matter what valley you have to go
[45:26] through it's all happening that it might
[45:28] be fulfilled now like i said there's
[45:31] many other ones and throughout the bible
[45:33] where we see fulfillment where we're
[45:34] just referenced in this phrase and we're
[45:36] going to look at a few of those
[45:37] scriptures this morning brother branham
[45:40] would say god spoke it it's got to be so
[45:44] thy word is settled in heaven forever
[45:46] it's already said they don't argue about
[45:49] it up there you know we may argue about
[45:51] what it means here and when's this going
[45:53] to happen and how that going but in
[45:54] heaven they don't argue about it he said
[45:57] it it's done it's settled and sometimes
[45:59] we wonder well when will when will win
[46:01] because we are time beings and so we're
[46:03] curious about time god is not a time
[46:06] being he is an eternal being and when he
[46:08] speaks that word is an eternal word it's
[46:11] going to come to pass he said they don't
[46:14] argue about it up there it's already
[46:16] settled we argue about it but in glory
[46:19] it's settled when god says anything it's
[46:22] got to be well isn't that wonderful i
[46:25] believe we could echo the prophet right
[46:27] there well isn't that wonderful because
[46:29] there's a word that says you're healed
[46:31] there's a word that says you're
[46:32] delivered there's a word that says
[46:34] you're gonna have a rapture there's a
[46:35] word that says these things it's already
[46:38] done it's already settled it's already
[46:40] finished in heaven and that's where it
[46:42] matters today
[46:44] we know that that fulfillment
[46:47] brings faith i know we're not to always
[46:49] look at it that way we're supposed to
[46:50] believe even when we don't see anything
[46:52] and as christians as abraham's seed we
[46:54] do but when we do see fulfillment it
[46:57] does elevate our faith to another level
[47:00] brother joe talked about that some in
[47:01] some of his sermons recently when we see
[47:04] the fulfillment of by his stripes we are
[47:07] healed it elevates our faith when we see
[47:10] the fulfillment of not even cancer then
[47:13] it elevates our faith it elevates us to
[47:16] believe for even more yes every one of
[47:18] us as we heard have a measure of faith
[47:21] that was given to us by god but that
[47:23] faith can be increased that faith can
[47:26] elevate and when we see the fulfillment
[47:27] of things it causes that faith to raise
[47:30] up
[47:30] and not only in the sense of things for
[47:32] like your healing or for your personal
[47:35] victory
[47:36] but if we will look at things through
[47:38] faith
[47:39] if we will look at the events going on
[47:41] in the world around us through faith
[47:44] looking at these events through faith in
[47:46] his word will stabilize you as a
[47:49] christian
[47:50] how many christians are up down up down
[47:54] up down up down and you're wondering why
[47:57] is there no stability
[47:59] why are they not stable it's because
[48:01] they're not looking at things through
[48:03] faith so every wave tosses them
[48:05] everything's taken the wrong way
[48:07] everything is offensive oh well this oh
[48:10] up down up down because there's no
[48:12] stabilizers on the ship but we got to
[48:14] begin to look at things through the eyes
[48:16] of faith understanding that god is going
[48:18] to fulfill everything god said he would
[48:21] do
[48:22] so if we look at everything even in the
[48:24] world through the eyes of faith it will
[48:26] stabilize you
[48:28] people tend to get so shook by the
[48:30] things happening in the world
[48:31] they get shook at the evil around them
[48:34] they get shook at what's going on in
[48:36] russia they get shook by the economy
[48:38] we're getting shook by gas prices
[48:42] we get shook by the sodom condition
[48:44] that's all around us but if we view
[48:46] those things through the word it does
[48:48] not and it will not shake you you say
[48:50] yep that's exactly what the word said
[48:53] was going to happen that's exactly how
[48:55] the word said things were going to be
[48:57] i'm looking at it through this is just
[48:59] god fulfilling exactly what god said he
[49:02] was going to do the word foretold it
[49:05] would be this way
[49:07] so many times we want the rapture we
[49:09] want the rapture it's the end time
[49:10] praise the lord end time message and you
[49:12] look at her why is all this happening
[49:15] what's going on i don't know the thing
[49:17] you said you believed for 30 years
[49:20] that's what's going on that's what's
[49:22] happening there's a world getting into
[49:24] an end time condition because god's word
[49:27] will be
[49:28] fulfilled listen the end times whether
[49:31] you're a believer or not the end times
[49:32] aren't going to be rosy for us
[49:35] it's not going to be easy well i didn't
[49:36] think these things were going to befall
[49:38] as long as we're here things are
[49:39] befalling
[49:41] as long as we're living in this world
[49:42] there's things we're affected by the
[49:44] things that go on it's not going to be
[49:45] rosy but i am looking for their
[49:48] fulfillment therefore i can recognize
[49:50] why i can place them in the scripture
[49:53] and recognize lift up your head your
[49:55] redemption draweth nah so instead of
[49:58] getting shook i'm getting a little bit
[49:59] excited i'm recognizing church it can't
[50:01] be long now it can't be long till our
[50:04] loved ones will appear to us it can't be
[50:06] long until we go into a rapture
[50:09] i'm placing them according to
[50:11] fulfillment
[50:12] all this stuff going on what's it mean
[50:14] brother aaron it means we're one step
[50:16] closer
[50:17] what's it mean it means we're going home
[50:19] soon
[50:20] this world has to be in an end time
[50:23] condition
[50:25] and i feel like and i'll speak for
[50:27] myself
[50:28] but most of us probably felt like that
[50:30] we knew how bad it would be and we knew
[50:32] how wicked it would be and every now we
[50:34] look back and we go man i thought it was
[50:35] bad
[50:36] 10 years ago
[50:38] i thought it was bad in the 90s i
[50:40] thought it was bad in the 80s
[50:42] and we thought we knew but i believe we
[50:44] come to a point where we recognize it is
[50:45] a complete open and bottomless pit
[50:48] and even when you think it's going as
[50:49] far as it can go it's still going it's
[50:52] still sliding it's going further and
[50:54] further brother branham says look at all
[50:56] the televisions and things getting these
[50:58] fictitious things in order
[51:00] it'll come a time i predict that people
[51:02] will be completely totally insane
[51:05] check
[51:11] the world will be the bible speaks of
[51:13] such hideous sites as they show in
[51:15] movies today of some prehistoric
[51:17] creatures eggs that's lived in the earth
[51:19] for so many thousands and millions of
[51:20] years hatch and come forth that's just a
[51:23] minor thing to what's going to happen
[51:25] when hell is open and the devil comes
[51:27] out with all of this mysterious things
[51:29] and locusts with hair like women and
[51:31] teeth-like lines while the world will be
[51:33] completely totally insane it's not but
[51:36] just one degree from it now
[51:40] 1965.
[51:46] brother branham was a prophet so i don't
[51:48] want to see i don't want to say that he
[51:50] didn't see how bad it was going to get
[51:52] but i'm just saying reading that quote
[51:54] in 1965 how much worse do you think it
[51:57] is now
[51:58] he said they were just a hair from being
[52:00] totally insane then where do you think
[52:02] right now look we're well beyond 1977
[52:05] the farthest the prophet of god could
[52:07] see because of the darkness we're well
[52:09] beyond that time how insane do you think
[52:11] the world is now how insane is it when
[52:14] people who stand for life are considered
[52:16] bigots how insane is it that that you
[52:19] people are considered the oddballs in
[52:21] the world how insane do we have to be
[52:24] when you look at the things being argued
[52:25] about in politics it absolutely makes no
[52:28] sense to a sane person but sanity is
[52:30] quickly becoming insanity because you're
[52:33] not like the people who are insane
[52:38] the world has gone completely mad
[52:41] the world is in an insane condition and
[52:43] yet i want to remind you that if the
[52:45] world is sitting in an end time
[52:47] condition if the world has completely
[52:49] lost their mind if the height of the
[52:51] tree of good and evil has reached it
[52:54] it's apex then there has to be another
[52:56] people on the earth today part of the
[52:59] revelation of the bride tree that has
[53:01] also reached its height of people that
[53:03] is also in an income type condition
[53:06] we're not in a condition for atomic
[53:08] bombs but we're in condition to be taken
[53:10] off the earth we're in a condition
[53:12] marching to onward christian soldier
[53:14] we're in a condition following the
[53:15] message of the hour we are also in an
[53:18] end time condition
[53:21] and i'm thankful to say we're in an end
[53:23] time condition we are in a rapture
[53:25] condition
[53:27] we can't look at it through earthly eyes
[53:29] of of of well how can it be that that
[53:31] we're in a rapture condition how can you
[53:33] say that i see this one struggling and i
[53:35] see that one falling away and and this
[53:38] church up here just split and and this
[53:40] one over here is preaching false things
[53:41] and then this preacher he's attacking
[53:43] this preacher
[53:45] you're looking at it through earthly
[53:46] eyes
[53:48] but i say look at it through the eyes of
[53:50] one who said i will have a bride without
[53:54] spot and without wrinkle i don't know
[53:56] how he's gonna do it but i know they
[53:58] don't argue about it in heaven i know
[54:00] they're not fussing about it in heaven
[54:02] because it's been said it's already done
[54:04] i'm just gonna walk in the fulfillment
[54:06] of it i'm just gonna believe it god i
[54:08] don't know how you're going to do it i
[54:10] didn't say it i didn't make the promise
[54:12] he made the promise he's the one that's
[54:14] going to bring it to pass today
[54:16] hallelujah
[54:18] he said it i believe it somebody is
[54:22] going to fulfill it
[54:27] the things that we look at for the
[54:29] future
[54:30] like the rapture
[54:33] these are not characterless events
[54:37] there are events that someone is going
[54:39] to be a part of that story
[54:41] someone is going sometimes we tend to
[54:43] look at it as just an event
[54:45] it is no event without a people it is no
[54:49] story without a character
[54:51] the acts weren't just acts written about
[54:53] nobody
[54:54] it was people doing the works of god it
[54:57] was people letting the holy spirit act
[54:59] through them and they recorded the acts
[55:00] of those people
[55:02] the rapture is gonna be your story you
[55:06] are the characters of the rapture
[55:08] because someone must play the part
[55:10] someone is going to look at the promises
[55:12] through faith and not through the eyes
[55:14] of earthly eyes and look through eyes of
[55:16] doubt abraham looked away from
[55:18] circumstance
[55:19] abraham looked away from the fact that
[55:21] his body was now dead and he looked to
[55:23] the fulfillment we have to begin looking
[55:26] to fulfill him there had been a word
[55:27] given and abraham knew my god will
[55:30] fulfill everything that he said
[55:32] he began to look at everything through
[55:34] the word of god we have to let the word
[55:37] of god become our filter
[55:39] because if you let your mind be your
[55:41] filter your genetics be your filter or
[55:44] your eyes be your filter or what
[55:46] somebody told you be your filter you'll
[55:47] be so twisted up torn up upset but you
[55:50] got to go back to what the word said
[55:52] this is our filter this is what we're
[55:53] looking through this is what we're
[55:55] standing on this is what i have faith in
[55:57] i don't have faith in this church i
[55:59] don't have faith in anything other than
[56:01] the word of god i don't look to a man
[56:04] because man will fail you don't look to
[56:06] me i will fail you but the word of god
[56:08] will never fail you
[56:10] look to the word of god because it will
[56:13] be fulfilled
[56:15] hallelujah
[56:16] [Applause]
[56:19] don't miss god because we view him and
[56:22] view our circumstances through the eyes
[56:24] of flesh because many times god is in
[56:27] things
[56:28] god is working in things
[56:30] and he's working through situations and
[56:32] we fail to recognize it because we're
[56:34] looking at the situation through hurt
[56:36] eyes
[56:37] or we're looking at the situation
[56:39] through scarred eyes or we're looking at
[56:41] the situation through tired eyes i've
[56:43] been through so much
[56:45] and we're looking at these things
[56:46] through eyes of doubt instead of through
[56:48] eyes of faith put everything through the
[56:50] word bring everything back to the word
[56:54] we have to look at things
[56:56] through eyes that say i know god's word
[57:00] will be fulfilled no matter what the
[57:03] situation
[57:05] you are the royal seat of abraham if
[57:08] abraham can look away from circumstance
[57:10] that's what we're going to do because we
[57:12] will be just like that we'll look away
[57:14] we will look to the promise i don't care
[57:16] how long it's been i don't care how long
[57:18] my son's been out there i don't care how
[57:20] long this sickness has battled i know
[57:22] god gave a word i will stand on the word
[57:24] i will look for fulfillment of the word
[57:26] i will fulfill the word
[57:31] it's time that we begin to look at our
[57:32] situations
[57:34] as actual opportunities for for
[57:36] fulfillment
[57:38] this sickness is an opportunity for the
[57:41] scripture to work
[57:43] my child has left but this is an
[57:45] opportunity for me to kill the fatted
[57:47] calf
[57:49] i'm not saying that we look for these
[57:51] situations and that we're welcoming
[57:54] these situations but what we do is we
[57:56] take these situations and we place them
[57:58] properly in the word and we begin to
[58:00] look for the purpose in our situation
[58:03] begin to find the purpose in your trial
[58:06] instead of giving the devil credit for
[58:08] every single thing the devil did and the
[58:10] devil did and the devil did i'm sure
[58:12] joseph thought it was the devil that had
[58:13] him down in egypt but it was god
[58:16] fulfilling his word
[58:18] find the purpose in your trial oh god i
[58:21] don't know why i'm here but i know if
[58:22] i'm here you're going to take care of me
[58:24] you're going to bring me through it your
[58:26] will will be fulfilled in this situation
[58:31] we don't welcome it but we must find a
[58:33] purpose in it and place in this trial
[58:37] we must begin to look for fulfillment
[58:41] not only for fulfillment in the sense
[58:43] that i want to see things fulfilled
[58:47] but i want to fulfill
[58:50] not just i want to see it fulfilled out
[58:52] there
[58:54] just like i just don't want to see a
[58:56] rapture happen
[58:59] i really rather view it from the inside

[59:04] fulfilled i want to fulfill the part i'm
[59:07] called to fulfill
[59:09] i want to walk into fulfillment the time
[59:11] has come for the fulfillment of all
[59:15] of god's word
[59:16] oh brother brown says now
[59:20] you know what the story came out
[59:22] this is lengthy but bear with me
[59:24] what was it
[59:25] years had passed but the time had come
[59:28] for that word to be fulfilled
[59:30] when the season roll around don't you
[59:32] worry the crop will be there that's
[59:34] right and brethren if there ever was a
[59:36] time for the next few minutes now i want
[59:38] to talk to you to your heart
[59:41] if there ever was a time
[59:43] that time has come for the word to be
[59:45] fulfilled it's now
[59:47] the time had come in the andaluvian
[59:49] world for god to show his word made true
[59:51] to the andaluvian people he respected
[59:54] noah the time had come in babylon where
[59:56] they'd laughed god to scorn they made
[59:58] fun of the hebrew children they laughed
[1:00:00] at them told them there was old fogies
[1:00:02] and everything they had to be modern but
[1:00:04] they stayed put god respects that
[1:00:06] staying put and they had laughed at them
[1:00:09] throw them in jail done everything to
[1:00:10] them but finally the time come for god
[1:00:12] to speak and he showed his power he was
[1:00:15] able to deliver them from the fiery
[1:00:16] furnace he showed his power when the
[1:00:18] time come when daniel was thrown into
[1:00:20] the lines then the time had come for god
[1:00:22] to move out and to speak and he closed
[1:00:24] the mouth of the line by sending an
[1:00:26] angel into the den with daniel jesus
[1:00:28] just before calvary the time had come
[1:00:30] when the proclamation must be signed the
[1:00:33] time had come when mary was coming from
[1:00:35] a well that day with a pot of water on
[1:00:37] her head the time had come for the
[1:00:39] visitation of the savior and a virgin
[1:00:41] was was to conceive and bear a son the
[1:00:44] time was there regardless of what the
[1:00:46] world didn't even believe it was there
[1:00:48] right in line with their teaching but
[1:00:51] the time had come and when the time has
[1:00:53] come it's going to happen amen the angel
[1:00:56] gabriel met the virgin and told her
[1:00:58] she'd be overshadowed by the holy ghost
[1:01:00] and would bring forth a son and he'd be
[1:01:02] the son of god never had happen in all
[1:01:04] the world but the time had come when
[1:01:06] every jewish woman had waited and
[1:01:08] watched for the time hoping it would be
[1:01:10] her but the time come when god made his
[1:01:12] choice god makes choices the time come
[1:01:15] when john the baptist was born as a
[1:01:17] forerunner to fulfill the word of god
[1:01:19] because he was the voice of one crying
[1:01:20] in the wilderness in isaiah 40 that
[1:01:22] there there'd be one several hundred
[1:01:24] years before he come the time come for
[1:01:27] john to be born and when the time come
[1:01:30] john arrived on the scene the time had
[1:01:32] come after jesus death after calvary the
[1:01:35] time come that he must die for the sins
[1:01:37] of the world he died just according to
[1:01:39] the scripture cause everybody believed
[1:01:41] that lined up with the word when the
[1:01:43] time come it must be fulfilled the time
[1:01:47] come for the scriptures to be fulfilled
[1:01:49] they put him in a grave they put a seal
[1:01:51] on the grave they garrisoned a bunch of
[1:01:53] soldiers a century a hundred men armed
[1:01:55] around there to be sure that nothing
[1:01:57] would take place i tell you the devil
[1:01:58] can put what he wants around you he can
[1:02:00] put what he wants around your children
[1:02:02] he can put what he wants around your
[1:02:03] health but when the time comes there
[1:02:06] ain't nothing going to stop him i'm
[1:02:07] telling you the time has come for
[1:02:08] fulfillment the time has come for
[1:02:10] healing the time has come for a rapture
[1:02:13] the time has come that we begin to
[1:02:14] fulfill all that we are called to
[1:02:17] fulfill
[1:02:19] he says for three days he laid there
[1:02:20] friday saturday sunday but on sunday
[1:02:23] morning the first easter no matter how
[1:02:24] many armies was there how well they was
[1:02:26] garrison the time had come for the word
[1:02:29] of god to be fulfilled oh i'll not
[1:02:31] suffer my holy one to see corruption
[1:02:33] neither will i leave his soul in hell
[1:02:35] the time had come i don't care what
[1:02:37] takes place it's going to happen anyhow
[1:02:40] the time had come and an angel come from
[1:02:42] heaven the men fell like dead men the
[1:02:44] grave opened christ walked out
[1:02:46] victorious over death hell in the grave
[1:02:48] the time had come
[1:02:50] and the word that speaks of the groom
[1:02:53] speaks also of the bride i say the time
[1:02:55] has come for us to begin to fulfill the
[1:02:58] things that we are called to fulfill in
[1:03:00] this last day
[1:03:02] the time has come and when the time
[1:03:05] comes there's nothing that the enemy can
[1:03:06] do about it
[1:03:07] the time has come for the fulfillment of
[1:03:09] all things the time has come for the
[1:03:12] prodigals to return
[1:03:13] the time has come for us to go in and to
[1:03:16] possess the land the time has come for a
[1:03:18] body change the time has come for the
[1:03:20] dead in christ to rise
[1:03:22] the time has come
[1:03:24] for everything to be fulfilled
[1:03:28] i want to go back to the very beginning
[1:03:30] now in genesis 3.
[1:03:34] and we're focusing for a while here on
[1:03:37] it will all be fulfilled crossing into
[1:03:40] fulfillment
[1:03:42] verse 3 it says
[1:03:45] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:03:47] the midst of the garden god has said you
[1:03:49] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[1:03:51] touch it lest you die
[1:03:53] and the serpent said unto the woman
[1:03:56] you shall not surely die
[1:03:59] notice here that the attack
[1:04:03] is that one word
[1:04:06] could possibly fail
[1:04:09] the attack
[1:04:10] is that it is possible
[1:04:12] for one word to fail
[1:04:15] because if one word can fail
[1:04:18] then what about this word
[1:04:21] and that one i've never been able to
[1:04:22] understand that one and if that one
[1:04:24] could fail
[1:04:25] then what about this one
[1:04:27] and then if that one can fail then what
[1:04:29] about this
[1:04:31] and if i want to point out where the
[1:04:32] profit was wrong here
[1:04:35] then what about here
[1:04:37] and because of here well maybe i need to
[1:04:39] have this discussion with somebody no
[1:04:42] you need to remember that the word of
[1:04:43] god is true you need to remember that
[1:04:45] the prophet was a vindicated prophet by
[1:04:48] almighty god
[1:04:49] and he brought a message to take you in
[1:04:51] a rapture that's what you need to
[1:04:52] remember
[1:04:55] if one word can contradict another then
[1:04:57] what about this one and what about this
[1:04:59] and then it all begins to unravel
[1:05:01] and then you have no place to stand you
[1:05:04] have no firm foundation and next thing
[1:05:06] you know you step off into a bottomless
[1:05:08] pit
[1:05:09] and there's nothing to stop you because
[1:05:11] when you get to the place that you can't
[1:05:12] believe in one word or this where the
[1:05:14] next thing it leads you to is there is
[1:05:15] no god
[1:05:17] there is nothing and now you're in the
[1:05:19] bottomless pit over and over and over
[1:05:21] and tumbling and you have no place of
[1:05:22] rest but the prophet would say to the
[1:05:25] believer if god said it that settles it
[1:05:28] there's your resting place
[1:05:31] if god said it that settles it there is
[1:05:35] your resting place i'll tell you today
[1:05:37] evening like tabernacle that you can
[1:05:38] hang your soul on every single word that
[1:05:41] god has spoken it will be fulfilled when
[1:05:45] the time has come i believe that we are
[1:05:47] walking in the season of fulfillment and
[1:05:49] the time has come for the fulfillment of
[1:05:51] these things and god's not going to let
[1:05:52] any of it fall he says in jeremiah 1 12
[1:05:55] then said the lord unto me thou has well
[1:05:58] seen for i will hasten my word to
[1:06:01] perform it i will do what i said i was
[1:06:05] going to do
[1:06:06] we're going to take just a few examples
[1:06:08] now as we slow down and go through these
[1:06:10] scriptures
[1:06:11] to drive this point home
[1:06:14] ezra 1 1
[1:06:15] and i'm going to read just going to be
[1:06:17] brief and i'll be moving quickly
[1:06:19] now in the first year of cyrus king of
[1:06:21] persia that the word of the lord by the
[1:06:23] mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled
[1:06:26] the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus
[1:06:29] king of persia
[1:06:30] matthew 2 15
[1:06:33] and was there until the death of herod
[1:06:35] that it might be fulfilled which was
[1:06:36] spoken to the lord by the prophet saying
[1:06:39] out of egypt have i called my son
[1:06:42] matthew 2 23 and he came and dwelt in a
[1:06:44] city called nazareth that it might be
[1:06:47] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[1:06:48] prophets he shall be called a nazarene
[1:06:52] matthew 8 16
[1:06:54] when they even was come they brought
[1:06:56] unto him many that were possessed with
[1:06:57] devils and he cast out the spirits with
[1:07:00] his word and healed all that were sick
[1:07:02] that it might be fulfilled which was
[1:07:03] spoken by isaiah as the prophet saying
[1:07:06] himself took our affirmatives and bear
[1:07:08] our sickness
[1:07:09] micah 5 2
[1:07:11] but thou bethlehem ephrata thou
[1:07:15] thou thou be little among the thousands
[1:07:17] of judah yet out of these shall he come
[1:07:19] forth
[1:07:20] unto thee that is to be ruler in israel
[1:07:22] whose goings forth have been from old
[1:07:25] from everlasting then you take that over
[1:07:27] to luke two and one now here's a
[1:07:28] scripture you can put that back up
[1:07:31] micah 5 and 2
[1:07:34] and it says out of bethlehem
[1:07:37] though thou be little among the
[1:07:38] thousands of judah yet out of these
[1:07:41] shall he come forth unto me that is to
[1:07:43] be ruler in israel
[1:07:45] and now mary's getting close
[1:07:47] to having this child
[1:07:49] and yet they're in nazareth
[1:07:52] and if you're reviewing this from the
[1:07:53] outside going yeah how they gonna
[1:07:55] fulfill this one
[1:07:57] i mean they got no reason to go to bed
[1:08:00] that's a long journey
[1:08:01] that is a long journey and she's not
[1:08:04] gonna be happy about it
[1:08:06] this isn't gonna be any fun and yet then
[1:08:08] you look over to luke two and one
[1:08:12] and it came to pass in those days that
[1:08:14] there went out a decree from caesar
[1:08:15] augustus
[1:08:17] that all the world should be taxed
[1:08:20] skip to verse three and all went to be
[1:08:23] taxed every one unto his own city and
[1:08:27] joseph also went up from galilee out of
[1:08:29] the city of nazareth into judea unto the
[1:08:31] city of david which is called bethlehem
[1:08:34] to be taxed with mary his espoused wife
[1:08:37] being great with child
[1:08:39] the taxation
[1:08:41] of an entire nation
[1:08:43] was to fulfill a scripture from the old
[1:08:46] testament
[1:08:48] brother branham would say i bet all
[1:08:49] those priests were griping and fussing
[1:08:51] and caesar this and said can you believe
[1:08:53] these taxes again
[1:08:55] sounds like my living room can you
[1:08:56] believe these gas prices and can you
[1:08:58] believe this and can you believe that
[1:09:00] and and they're taking this federal tax
[1:09:02] and they're taking taxes to fix the
[1:09:04] roads and they sure ain't fixing the
[1:09:05] roads then they tax my vehicle to drive
[1:09:08] on roads to make sure my car is worthy
[1:09:10] to drive on roads that are unworthy
[1:09:17] took me 30 minutes but i hit home with
[1:09:19] some of you
[1:09:23] i'm telling you and brother brown says
[1:09:25] not knowing all along
[1:09:27] that every one of those things was just
[1:09:29] to fulfill a scripture
[1:09:32] get your eyes off the circumstances quit
[1:09:34] worrying about the world falling apart
[1:09:36] around you it's supposed to fall apart
[1:09:38] and recognize there's a bride getting
[1:09:40] ready to leave here there's a scripture
[1:09:43] that says we're gonna go and it has to
[1:09:45] get us in an end time condition
[1:09:48] get us there lord do whatever it takes
[1:09:50] to get me ready do whatever it takes i
[1:09:52] want to leave here i don't want to be
[1:09:54] comfortable here
[1:09:55] i'm tired of here and if it takes my
[1:09:58] axle getting knocked out on i-20
[1:10:00] whatever
[1:10:01] i just want to go
[1:10:04] but please don't let my axle get knocked
[1:10:06] out
[1:10:12] not recognizing there was fulfillment
[1:10:14] happening fulfillment of bethlehem
[1:10:17] brother brown says another thing we want
[1:10:19] to notice is just at the very time that
[1:10:21] he had to raise taxes on the people and
[1:10:24] in doing that it forced joseph and his
[1:10:26] wife to be forced back to bethlehem
[1:10:29] god
[1:10:30] knows how to do things church don't ever
[1:10:33] forget that god knows how to do things
[1:10:36] as i said wednesday night i mess up a
[1:10:37] lot of stuff every time i get my hands
[1:10:39] in and think i know how to do something
[1:10:40] i mess things up but god has never
[1:10:42] messed up one time he knows what he's
[1:10:45] doing he knows where your kids are he
[1:10:47] knows the situation in your home he
[1:10:49] knows and he knows how to fix it he
[1:10:51] knows and he's taking care of it he
[1:10:53] knows and he's already on the scene he
[1:10:55] knows and he's moving on your behalf god
[1:10:57] knows this morning and he cares and i'm
[1:11:00] looking for the fulfillment of what he's
[1:11:02] promised me
[1:11:04] psalm 78-2
[1:11:07] i will open my mouth in a parable
[1:11:11] matthew 13 34
[1:11:15] all these things spake jesus unto the
[1:11:17] multitude in parables and without a
[1:11:19] parable spake he not unto them
[1:11:22] that it might be fulfilled which was
[1:11:23] spoken by the prophet saying i will open
[1:11:25] my mouth in parables
[1:11:28] psalms 22 18
[1:11:30] they part my garments among them and
[1:11:32] cast lots upon my bestie
[1:11:35] matthew 27 35 and they crucified him and
[1:11:38] parted his garments casting lots that it
[1:11:41] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[1:11:42] the prophet they parted my garments
[1:11:45] among them and upon my vesture did they
[1:11:47] cast lots
[1:11:49] look not one word is going to fall to
[1:11:51] the ground boy
[1:11:52] not one word is put in the bible just to
[1:11:54] take up space
[1:11:55] not one promise is there that's not
[1:11:57] going to be fulfilled there's just got
[1:11:59] to be somebody with the initiative that
[1:12:01] says i'll cross over and i'll fulfill
[1:12:03] what the promise said i was supposed to
[1:12:05] the promise said i was supposed to
[1:12:07] inherit that the promise said that is
[1:12:09] where i'm supposed to go i'm not going
[1:12:10] to stop short i'm not going to stop on
[1:12:12] this side i'm not going to be okay with
[1:12:14] one child saved i'm not going to be okay
[1:12:16] with a partial healing i'm not going to
[1:12:17] be stopping just at justification there
[1:12:19] is more promise for me there are promise
[1:12:22] to be fulfilled and i am going to cross
[1:12:24] over into fulfillment of the word of god
[1:12:29] god knows what he's doing
[1:12:33] i want to remind you today that the
[1:12:34] circumstances are not in control
[1:12:38] god is using the circumstances to get
[1:12:40] you where you need to be and to fulfill
[1:12:43] the promises that he's already written
[1:12:45] in the promises that he has given every
[1:12:47] scripture every word everything spoke
[1:12:50] about you will come to pass
[1:12:52] everything spoke about you will come to
[1:12:55] pass but you got to keep your eye on the
[1:12:58] promise and get it off the circumstance
[1:13:01] keep your eyes on the word because
[1:13:03] somebody
[1:13:04] is going to fulfill it
[1:13:06] hold fast that which you have
[1:13:10] fight for it be willing to stand for it
[1:13:12] because somebody's going to fulfill it
[1:13:15] others may stop short others may find a
[1:13:18] good place to stop but i say i want to
[1:13:20] fulfill what god called me to fulfill i
[1:13:23] can't really worry about what other
[1:13:24] people do
[1:13:26] look i love this church i love these
[1:13:28] people but it's not for my experience
[1:13:30] isn't based off what you do
[1:13:32] my inheritance isn't based off what you
[1:13:34] do i have to go get the inheritance i
[1:13:37] have to press into the land i have to
[1:13:39] press into the promise
[1:13:42] the other tribes couldn't help that that
[1:13:44] reuben and gad stopped short
[1:13:47] they had to press in
[1:13:49] they still had a land that they had to
[1:13:51] possess
[1:13:53] malachi 4 was sent to turn us back to
[1:13:56] faith
[1:13:56] to turn us back to the book of acts back
[1:13:59] to the works that i do shall you do also
[1:14:03] and somebody's going to fulfill that
[1:14:06] some people are just going to find out
[1:14:07] that god sent a prophet
[1:14:09] some people are just going to accept a
[1:14:10] new lifestyle make you no different from
[1:14:12] the amish
[1:14:14] but some people are going to return to
[1:14:16] the faith of the original church they're
[1:14:19] going to turn back to the original grain
[1:14:22] somebody is going to go all the way back
[1:14:24] to the upper room experience and walk
[1:14:27] through the book of acts and create
[1:14:28] another book of acts
[1:14:31] i say it's time to add a chapter i say
[1:14:33] it's time to write your chapter in the
[1:14:35] book of acts tell about your healing
[1:14:37] your deliverance your overcoming your
[1:14:40] salvation your experience with the holy
[1:14:42] ghost it's time you write your chapter
[1:14:44] in the book of acts
[1:14:50] somebody's going to overcome laodicea
[1:14:53] somebody is going to take the land of
[1:14:55] the holy ghost
[1:14:58] might as well be us
[1:15:02] you've been fighting and you've been
[1:15:03] journeying why stop short
[1:15:05] you've gone through all you've gone
[1:15:07] through why stop short
[1:15:09] press in this morning press over this
[1:15:11] morning
[1:15:13] brother branham says now we're going to
[1:15:14] speak just a few moments
[1:15:17] on the authority of god's word
[1:15:20] every word of god is a written sworn
[1:15:22] authority
[1:15:23] it's the absolute right of the believer
[1:15:25] to accept this as the infallible truth
[1:15:28] because it's god's word
[1:15:30] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:15:32] word will never pass away
[1:15:34] saith the lord it must be fulfilled
[1:15:37] in its season
[1:15:39] we are in the season for fulfillment
[1:15:44] now going back to where we were
[1:15:45] wednesday
[1:15:48] god had promised abraham this land
[1:15:50] and he had promised that
[1:15:52] foretold
[1:15:54] the children of israel end up in egypt
[1:15:55] or in a strange land and served them
[1:15:58] for 400 years and then they would be
[1:16:00] delivered
[1:16:01] and then they would come out with great
[1:16:03] substance
[1:16:04] and here we are god has fulfilled his
[1:16:06] word that he told abraham about his seed
[1:16:09] dwelling in a strange land for 400 years
[1:16:11] there in genesis 15 13.
[1:16:13] and he had fulfilled his word about the
[1:16:15] nation that would enslave them and then
[1:16:17] them being judged there in genesis 15
[1:16:20] and 14.
[1:16:21] it's also in this verse
[1:16:25] in genesis 15 14 where god declares to
[1:16:28] abraham that they're going to come out
[1:16:29] with great substance
[1:16:32] and this had also been repeated to moses
[1:16:34] in exodus 3 if you look at exodus 3 and
[1:16:36] 21
[1:16:38] it says and i will give this people
[1:16:39] favor in the sight of the egyptians
[1:16:42] and it shall come to pass that when you
[1:16:44] go
[1:16:45] you shall not go empty
[1:16:48] i gotta admit you know we all look at
[1:16:50] things sometimes and we're like
[1:16:52] how
[1:16:55] look i know i've been your slave for 400
[1:16:57] years
[1:16:58] but can i have all your gold
[1:17:02] please
[1:17:04] okay how about some silver
[1:17:06] and they just said yeah here take it is
[1:17:08] it come on in you go through the china
[1:17:10] cabinet
[1:17:11] you know i was saving this for my son's
[1:17:12] college but he don't need it there you
[1:17:13] go
[1:17:14] just go ahead
[1:17:16] it never really made sense to me
[1:17:19] now i understand that the way it
[1:17:20] happened is because he said i will give
[1:17:22] this people favor
[1:17:24] but i'm still trying to envision it like
[1:17:26] what was their attitude
[1:17:28] i thought you'd never ask i wanted to
[1:17:30] give it to you last week but you didn't
[1:17:32] come by so i just held on to it
[1:17:34] yeah fella down there he's super rich
[1:17:36] i'd go knock on his door
[1:17:39] i just i've always looked at it and
[1:17:42] i'm not real smart so that's kind of
[1:17:44] what i came up with
[1:17:45] was that that i just told you
[1:17:47] and sometimes we look at things and we
[1:17:49] wonder
[1:17:50] how lord
[1:17:53] this this would fall under the category
[1:17:55] of how
[1:17:56] to me
[1:17:57] if you're standing there on the outside
[1:17:59] and you're observing
[1:18:00] or you're actually there as one of the
[1:18:02] slaves
[1:18:04] and moses tells you
[1:18:06] okay and just go i want all right you
[1:18:07] you got that neighborhood go knock on
[1:18:09] their doors ask for their goal
[1:18:12] that's where my task master lives yeah
[1:18:14] go there first
[1:18:18] how lord
[1:18:20] how is this going to work you've been
[1:18:22] told your whole life
[1:18:23] you're nothing
[1:18:25] you've had everything stripped from you
[1:18:27] by these people
[1:18:28] they've been taken and they've been
[1:18:30] taken and they've been beaten you and
[1:18:31] you've been told you're worthless you've
[1:18:33] been told you can't leave you've been
[1:18:35] told you'll never possess the promise
[1:18:38] you might look at this and go slaves and
[1:18:41] great substance don't exactly go hand in
[1:18:43] hand
[1:18:45] but never forget
[1:18:47] how quickly circumstances can change in
[1:18:49] the presence of god
[1:18:51] never forget how quick he can turn it
[1:18:53] only takes one moment in his presence
[1:18:55] one moment in the presence of god you
[1:18:57] can be sitting there as centered and
[1:18:59] then you can be filled with the baptism
[1:19:00] of the holy ghost one moment can change
[1:19:03] everything you walk in here sick you can
[1:19:05] walk out of here well walk in here bound
[1:19:08] walk out of here free and you might look
[1:19:10] at it and go how lord i know that guy i
[1:19:12] know how did that happen one moment in
[1:19:15] his presence is all it takes
[1:19:18] oh but my situation's bad this is bad
[1:19:20] this is bad i don't know how i'm going
[1:19:21] to pay my bills let me remind you one
[1:19:24] day ruth was gleaning in the field
[1:19:26] trying to survive and the next day she
[1:19:28] owned the field
[1:19:30] one day she was a poor beggar and the
[1:19:32] next day she owned it all
[1:19:34] it only takes a moment in the king's
[1:19:36] presence
[1:19:37] it only takes a moment
[1:19:40] never forget how quickly god can work
[1:19:42] one moment can change everything
[1:19:46] one moment old dad was sitting on the
[1:19:48] porch crying because his son was gone
[1:19:50] the next moment he's running down that
[1:19:52] road to greet his son
[1:19:54] one moment's difference
[1:19:56] one moment my child left the next moment
[1:19:58] my child's come home
[1:20:00] it only takes one moment
[1:20:03] it only takes a moment in his presence
[1:20:05] it only takes one moment and everything
[1:20:07] he's robbed from you he's going to have
[1:20:08] to give back
[1:20:10] your help he's got to give it back take
[1:20:12] it back this morning fight for it this
[1:20:14] morning it may not come easy but he's
[1:20:16] got to give it back
[1:20:19] he says oh you've done this sin
[1:20:21] you've struggled with pornography you've
[1:20:24] been in drugs you've been backslidden
[1:20:26] you've done this you've done that you're
[1:20:28] my slave
[1:20:29] you can never be free you can never be
[1:20:33] rich in peace you can never be rich in
[1:20:35] joy you can't have your children back
[1:20:38] you can never have overcoming power and
[1:20:40] he takes and he takes and he takes just
[1:20:43] like the slaves they were beaten and
[1:20:45] took from beaten and took from but you
[1:20:47] just keep plaguing him you just keep
[1:20:50] pouring out the plagues you just keep
[1:20:51] standing and refusing to bow you just
[1:20:54] keep calling on the name of the lord and
[1:20:56] one of these days he's going to say i've
[1:20:57] had enough
[1:20:58] take your joy take your peace take your
[1:21:01] children take your rapture and just get
[1:21:03] out i've had enough
[1:21:05] in one moment's time get out of my
[1:21:07] kingdom
[1:21:09] you are keeping satan from enjoying his
[1:21:12] kingdom
[1:21:13] he's sick of you he's tired of you he
[1:21:16] tells you you're gonna break you're
[1:21:17] gonna break no sir i'm gonna leave
[1:21:21] he's gonna get so tired of you he's
[1:21:22] gonna say take it
[1:21:24] just take it and go
[1:21:27] hallelujah
[1:21:29] take it and go
[1:21:34] oh church i'm ready to go
[1:21:37] there's a pool from up there and it's
[1:21:39] stronger than the pool from below
[1:21:41] i'm ready to go
[1:21:47] you know
[1:21:48] some of the writers
[1:21:53] looking look into the psalms
[1:21:55] and they say that the egyptians actually
[1:21:57] gladly gave them all their riches
[1:21:59] as long as they promised that they would
[1:22:01] leave and take the plagues with them
[1:22:05] here's your joy here's your peace here's
[1:22:07] everything i took but just go and take
[1:22:09] some people down and even like
[1:22:11] tabernacle with you take them people
[1:22:13] with you just get out i'm sick of the
[1:22:15] plagues i'm sick of the frogs i'm sick
[1:22:17] of you casting out my devils i'm sick of
[1:22:18] the healing i'm sick of you getting the
[1:22:20] holy ghost when your feet hit the floor
[1:22:22] in the morning i don't even know what to
[1:22:23] do with you just take it if you promise
[1:22:26] to go
[1:22:27] i'll go
[1:22:30] i'll have my joy i'll have my peace and
[1:22:32] i will go
[1:22:34] hallelujah
[1:22:39] it says in psalms 105 37 and he brought
[1:22:42] them forth with silver and gold and
[1:22:44] there was not one feeble person among
[1:22:46] their tribes
[1:22:47] verse 38
[1:22:48] egypt was glad when they departed
[1:22:53] for the fear of them fell upon them
[1:22:57] now look we know it was god that had
[1:22:58] done everything
[1:23:01] but look how god works
[1:23:03] the fear of
[1:23:05] them
[1:23:07] now we know our god is one god
[1:23:10] and they weren't just afraid of the
[1:23:12] people
[1:23:13] they were them is
[1:23:15] the people
[1:23:17] and their god
[1:23:19] he was afraid of a people and their god
[1:23:22] a people that know their god and will do
[1:23:25] exploits
[1:23:26] he is afraid of a people who know their
[1:23:29] god
[1:23:33] he's going to give it back
[1:23:35] and if for some reason satan comes to
[1:23:37] you and says
[1:23:38] you really have no legal right to your
[1:23:40] freedom
[1:23:41] you have no rights to the joy you have
[1:23:43] no rights to the peace you still got
[1:23:45] some reaping to do he want to hold that
[1:23:47] over your head
[1:23:48] you owe me
[1:23:50] give all that stuff back
[1:23:52] give me a joy back
[1:23:54] you still owe me
[1:23:56] you're not really free you still see
[1:23:57] pharaoh had that epiphany
[1:23:59] oh
[1:24:00] they still owe me they took all the gold
[1:24:03] and silver
[1:24:04] and my free labor
[1:24:06] and they they took from me and took me
[1:24:08] it's funny how quick the devil forgets
[1:24:10] what he took from you
[1:24:12] and it took from me
[1:24:14] they're gonna give it all back
[1:24:18] church my debt's been paid
[1:24:20] i don't know the devil one thing
[1:24:22] i don't know him nothing it's all been
[1:24:24] forgotten it's all been washed away by
[1:24:26] the blood of the lamb i don't owe him a
[1:24:29] thing if anything he owes me he owes me
[1:24:32] for lost time he owes me wages for lost
[1:24:34] time he owes me because he held me a
[1:24:37] slave
[1:24:41] he owes me because he's still trying to
[1:24:43] hold some things back from me
[1:24:45] he's still trying to hold some promises
[1:24:46] back from him but he can't have him he
[1:24:48] says you owe me this you owe me the all
[1:24:50] devil you owe me you still got some
[1:24:52] things i'm coming for you still you
[1:24:54] think i've left you alone you think i'm
[1:24:55] done plaguing you can't do it because we
[1:24:57] ain't left yet i still got some plagues
[1:24:58] to pour out on your head i still got
[1:25:00] some young people that have come to see
[1:25:01] the holy ghost i still got some devils

[1:25:05] things that's gonna be poured out on you
[1:25:07] we ain't done yet you owe
[1:25:10] me
[1:25:14] 4th century bc
[1:25:17] there was a group of egyptian
[1:25:18] representatives who actually appeared in
[1:25:19] the court of alexander the great
[1:25:22] this story is awesome
[1:25:27] demanding that the jews pay restitution
[1:25:30] for all the egyptian gold and silver
[1:25:32] they took along with them during the
[1:25:33] exodus
[1:25:35] it's funny i thought that didn't happen
[1:25:38] i thought the exodus wasn't real
[1:25:41] well
[1:25:42] according to the court records of
[1:25:43] alexander the great this court case
[1:25:45] happened
[1:25:49] gavia
[1:25:50] the son of poseisa a simple but wise jew
[1:25:53] requested the sage's permission to
[1:25:55] present a defense on behalf of the jews
[1:25:58] gavia asked the egyptians for evidence
[1:26:01] that the jews
[1:26:03] have
[1:26:04] i'm gonna make up my own word stole
[1:26:08] and left egypt with the egyptians wealth
[1:26:12] the egyptians said the crime is clearly
[1:26:14] recorded in your torah
[1:26:17] the egyptians gleefully responded
[1:26:20] it's right there you were a sinner
[1:26:23] you were lost without hope
[1:26:27] such were some of you the scripture says
[1:26:30] liars and adulterers
[1:26:32] all kind of things it's recorded right
[1:26:34] there
[1:26:35] it's in your word
[1:26:37] he said it's encorted right there in
[1:26:39] that case kavia said the torah also says
[1:26:42] that 600 000 jews were unjustly enslaved
[1:26:46] by the egyptians for many many years so
[1:26:48] first let us start by calculating how
[1:26:50] much you owe us
[1:26:54] whoa glory
[1:26:55] let's start devil by calculating how
[1:26:57] much you got that belongs to me my
[1:27:00] debt's been cleared but there's still
[1:27:02] some reckoning for you to do there's
[1:27:04] still a lake of fire for you there's
[1:27:06] still judgment for you it's time for a
[1:27:08] reckoning on what you owe me
[1:27:13] i owe him nothing
[1:27:15] it's washed away i have a clean slate
[1:27:17] it's in the sea of god's forgetfulness i
[1:27:20] owe him nothing
[1:27:21] [Applause]
[1:27:27] says they asked for three days
[1:27:29] to come up with the response and never
[1:27:31] returned
[1:27:33] probably a wise decision
[1:27:36] the egyptians came out i know
[1:27:39] israelites came out of egypt wealthy
[1:27:41] they came out blessed
[1:27:43] and they came out victorious because the
[1:27:45] scripture
[1:27:46] had to be fulfilled
[1:27:48] it was a time
[1:27:49] for fulfillment
[1:27:51] every step of the way they walked in
[1:27:54] fulfillment
[1:27:55] they're going on this journey and it's
[1:27:56] fulfillment after fulfillment
[1:27:59] and even though they come to a great
[1:28:00] stumbling there at kadesh
[1:28:03] that didn't stop the word from being
[1:28:05] fulfilled
[1:28:07] god just had to use a different
[1:28:08] generation
[1:28:11] still the seed of abraham
[1:28:13] and they were still going to possess the
[1:28:14] land
[1:28:15] but he had to get somebody else
[1:28:18] to do it
[1:28:20] genesis 15 18 says in the same day the
[1:28:22] lord made a covenant with abram
[1:28:24] saying unto thy seed have i given this
[1:28:26] land
[1:28:27] from the river of egypt and to the great
[1:28:29] river the river euphrates
[1:28:31] this was going to be fulfilled
[1:28:35] and once again god had a people
[1:28:40] god had a people that wouldn't go all
[1:28:42] the way
[1:28:44] but he said no this word's going to be
[1:28:45] fulfilled
[1:28:46] so he put it on someone else to fulfill
[1:28:48] it what am i telling you
[1:28:50] we're in a season of fulfillment
[1:28:52] make sure you're fulfilling what god has
[1:28:54] called you to fulfill because someone's
[1:28:57] going to
[1:28:58] someone is going to rise up
[1:29:01] the royal seat of abraham
[1:29:03] moving away from the physical seed for a
[1:29:06] minute
[1:29:07] once again god is coming to people that
[1:29:09] had become enslaved
[1:29:11] down through the ages down through the
[1:29:13] church ages they had become enslaved in
[1:29:15] a catholic system held them bound with
[1:29:17] creeds and dogmas of men
[1:29:20] held them
[1:29:21] by withholding the word from them
[1:29:24] that was the main thing they did is they
[1:29:26] just wouldn't let them have the word
[1:29:27] they withheld it from them
[1:29:29] but god moved and luther came out and
[1:29:31] the reformation began
[1:29:33] and it wasn't a reformation for the sake
[1:29:36] of reformation
[1:29:38] it wasn't just let's correct some things
[1:29:40] it was a beginning of a journey
[1:29:43] it was the beginning of a journey to
[1:29:46] return back to the original
[1:29:48] to return back to how god started the
[1:29:51] church i know we say it here and you've
[1:29:53] heard it before
[1:29:54] but god started the church the way he
[1:29:57] wanted it and now he wants the church
[1:29:59] the way he started it
[1:30:02] he wants it back to how he started
[1:30:04] brother brown said it comes back to the
[1:30:06] original grain is that right and his
[1:30:09] ministry comes from them reformations
[1:30:11] back to the original word again the word
[1:30:14] comes to a prophet and he promised it in
[1:30:16] malachi 4 and to restore the faith of
[1:30:19] the people back to the original grain
[1:30:22] what went into the ground there
[1:30:25] is here
[1:30:26] the same
[1:30:28] someone's going to fulfill
[1:30:30] someone's going to go all the way back
[1:30:32] to the original there's got to come
[1:30:35] somebody church brother aaron you keep
[1:30:37] hammering this you keep him that's what
[1:30:39] the sermon's about we're going to keep
[1:30:40] hammering a little bit longer
[1:30:42] there's got to be somebody that's not
[1:30:44] going to stop short and they're going to
[1:30:46] fulfill all that was promised to them a
[1:30:49] people willing to cross over the river
[1:30:51] into the original
[1:30:55] joel 2 25 and i will restore to you the
[1:30:57] years that the locusts hath eaten the
[1:30:59] canker worm and the caterpillar
[1:31:02] and the palmer worm my great army which
[1:31:04] i sent among you and you shall eat in
[1:31:06] plenty and be satisfied and praise the
[1:31:09] name of the lord your god that hath
[1:31:11] dealt wondrously with you and my people
[1:31:13] shall never be ashamed there is going to
[1:31:16] be a people that's restored back to
[1:31:18] before the locust
[1:31:20] restored back to before the canker worm
[1:31:23] restored back to before the palmer worm
[1:31:26] and restored back before the nicean
[1:31:28] council
[1:31:29] when rome put their hands firmly on it
[1:31:31] somebody's going to be willing to cross
[1:31:33] over let's just say it back to pentecost
[1:31:36] again
[1:31:37] cross over back to the original
[1:31:39] pentecost back to the grain again
[1:31:43] beyond the shuck
[1:31:45] beyond the reformation because it's only
[1:31:47] in that place listen it's only in the
[1:31:49] place of the original
[1:31:51] only in the place of the grain again
[1:31:53] that you can be in position to fulfill
[1:31:56] what god wants fulfilled in this day
[1:32:00] you can't fulfill the rapture outside of
[1:32:03] the original
[1:32:04] you can't fulfill greater than these
[1:32:07] works shall you do outside of the
[1:32:09] original
[1:32:10] you have to cross back over into the
[1:32:12] original in order to be able to fulfill
[1:32:15] reuben and gad and the half tribe of
[1:32:17] manasseh stopped just short
[1:32:20] of crossing over
[1:32:22] they stopped just short of fulfilling
[1:32:24] what they were supposed to fulfill
[1:32:26] they were supposed to feel the
[1:32:28] possessing of the promised land
[1:32:30] they did not fulfill it
[1:32:32] because they did not cross over
[1:32:35] okay but today we're living in a time of
[1:32:37] crossing over
[1:32:38] we're living in the day of fulfillment
[1:32:41] listen
[1:32:43] it didn't matter that gad and reuben
[1:32:45] didn't cross over the day before
[1:32:48] because it wasn't crossing day
[1:32:51] it didn't matter
[1:32:53] that they didn't cross over day before
[1:32:55] that
[1:32:56] because everybody was camped out waiting
[1:32:58] for the time
[1:33:01] but when the time came
[1:33:04] and it was time to possess
[1:33:06] it was time to fulfill
[1:33:08] and they didn't move then
[1:33:11] then somebody else got their inheritance
[1:33:14] somebody else was granted their portion
[1:33:16] because instead of 12 tribes inheriting
[1:33:18] now nine and a half tribes inherited and
[1:33:21] the sizes of their land was enlarged
[1:33:24] your portion is going to be inherited
[1:33:27] somebody's going to take the rapture
[1:33:29] somebody's going to believe for healing
[1:33:31] somebody's going to believe for
[1:33:33] everything in the word
[1:33:34] and if you don't it's not gonna stop the
[1:33:36] fulfillment somebody else is just gonna
[1:33:38] do it
[1:33:39] somebody else is gonna take your portion
[1:33:42] on crossing over day listen it is the
[1:33:44] time of fulfillment it is the time to
[1:33:47] cross over brother brown says now what
[1:33:49] have we adopted today
[1:33:51] we've adopted other things
[1:33:53] we've adopted church membership instead
[1:33:55] of the upper room
[1:33:57] we've adopted theology instead of the
[1:33:58] baptism of the holy ghost we've adopted
[1:34:01] everything else in the stead of the
[1:34:03] thing that god told us to do
[1:34:05] because we've listened to the rules and
[1:34:07] orders of men but when that gospel light
[1:34:09] shined in the morning over yonder on the
[1:34:11] eastern country oh it's been a day that
[1:34:13] wasn't dark nor light it's been a day
[1:34:16] hazy the sun its power could not be seen
[1:34:19] a mixed light a hazy day they knowed the
[1:34:21] sun was shining but the clouds had just
[1:34:23] put it out of their sight people's had
[1:34:25] enough faith to say yes jesus was the
[1:34:28] son of god oh he's gone gone way away we
[1:34:31] can see enough to believe for salvation
[1:34:34] but you can't believe all of it they
[1:34:36] stop
[1:34:37] short
[1:34:39] like the prophets when the king come to
[1:34:41] him like the prophet when the king come
[1:34:43] to him and ask him for victory get a
[1:34:45] victory over syria he put his hand on
[1:34:47] his arms and says strike the floor and
[1:34:49] he only struck twice and the prophet
[1:34:51] said why didn't you strike many times
[1:34:53] you come short god would have given you
[1:34:55] many victories and i say with this
[1:34:57] reverence tonight in the church the
[1:34:58] church has been striking short of what
[1:35:00] god revealed to them striking short they
[1:35:03] only struck a couple times we can be
[1:35:05] free from sin that's good we can have
[1:35:07] joy that's good but why don't we strike
[1:35:09] for divine healing why don't we strike
[1:35:11] for the power of god why don't we strike
[1:35:13] for the restoration of the gifts why
[1:35:15] don't we strike that jesus is the same
[1:35:17] yesterday today and forever while god's
[1:35:19] got his hand rested on ours let's win
[1:35:22] the victory over sin and everything that
[1:35:24] jesus died to free us from the church is
[1:35:27] striking short
[1:35:29] they just make a little strike but it
[1:35:31] don't do no good like we strike just one
[1:35:34] time two times let's keep striking
[1:35:36] calvary spelled freedom calvary don't
[1:35:38] strike short everything the bible says
[1:35:40] it with everything how do you do it the
[1:35:43] prophet the seer had his hand on him as
[1:35:46] long as christ has got his hand on you
[1:35:47] in the baptism of the holy spirit keep
[1:35:50] striking god is with you
[1:35:53] church let's not just strike twice today
[1:35:56] but let's keep striking and keep
[1:35:57] striking and keep striking god i won't
[1:36:00] give up there's still promises there's
[1:36:02] still more i'm going to strike i'm going
[1:36:04] to strike as long as his hand's on me
[1:36:06] i'm going to keep striking
[1:36:08] not just for justification i thank you
[1:36:10] for that lord not just your
[1:36:12] sanctification i thank you for that lord
[1:36:14] but i need your holy spirit i'm gonna
[1:36:16] strike until i'm all the way back to the
[1:36:17] original i'm gonna strike till i'm back
[1:36:20] in the book of acts i'm gonna strike
[1:36:22] till we cross the river
[1:36:24] keep striking
[1:36:27] young people don't just strike for a
[1:36:28] jump and shout
[1:36:30] strike for more
[1:36:32] don't just strike for excitement strike
[1:36:34] for more
[1:36:36] oh you know i love a jump and a shout
[1:36:38] but just don't stop there strike for
[1:36:40] more you keep striking till you know
[1:36:43] you're sealed away
[1:36:45] he says strike for the power of god
[1:36:47] strike for healing strike forgive strike
[1:36:49] for it all don't strike short
[1:36:53] listen all those things he said
[1:36:54] individually
[1:36:56] is good land
[1:37:00] nobody doubted that reuben and gad
[1:37:01] stopped in good land
[1:37:05] there was more
[1:37:07] the promised land contained it all
[1:37:11] he's saying he's not telling you not to
[1:37:12] strike for those things
[1:37:14] he's saying strike for all of them
[1:37:18] it's like when people say
[1:37:19] well we don't need tongues in this
[1:37:20] anymore because when that which is
[1:37:22] perfect has come that which is in part
[1:37:23] is done away with
[1:37:25] well if you do away with a part of the
[1:37:28] hole you don't have the hole anymore
[1:37:31] that's what brother brandon i'm saying
[1:37:32] don't just strike for part
[1:37:34] get all of it
[1:37:36] get every last bit of it
[1:37:38] reuben and gad stopped in a good land
[1:37:41] the denominations found some good land
[1:37:43] there's no doubt
[1:37:45] they found places to settle they found
[1:37:47] some words that were truth
[1:37:49] and they stopped right there and they
[1:37:50] put a period after their experience
[1:37:54] and that's where so many are at today
[1:37:57] even in the ranks of the message
[1:38:02] they've walked in fulfillment all the
[1:38:04] way up to the border land
[1:38:06] of the original
[1:38:08] but just haven't crossed over
[1:38:11] they're standing right on the borderland
[1:38:13] of the original
[1:38:15] that's not to be judgmental that's just
[1:38:16] saying come on in
[1:38:18] come on there's plenty what moses tell
[1:38:20] them that if they didn't do everything
[1:38:22] they said they could still have land in
[1:38:23] the promise
[1:38:24] come on in
[1:38:25] the land's good it's everything god
[1:38:27] promised it would be you don't have to
[1:38:29] stay out there you don't have to stay on
[1:38:31] the border come on in water's good the
[1:38:34] land's good it's flowing with milk and
[1:38:35] honey everything he promised in this
[1:38:37] holy ghost land is here there's healing
[1:38:39] here there's deliverance here there's
[1:38:41] joy here they're shouting here they're
[1:38:44] speaking in tongues here there's
[1:38:45] prophecy here it's all in the land come
[1:38:48] on across it's a good land
[1:38:51] enter into this land
[1:38:53] you're living below your
[1:38:56] privileges and in that condition living
[1:38:59] on the other side of the original you
[1:39:01] aren't in place to fulfill what the
[1:39:03] bride is called to fulfill
[1:39:06] reuben and gad actually denied the
[1:39:08] leadership of jehovah even though they
[1:39:10] had followed the leadership of jehovah
[1:39:12] for all those years
[1:39:15] but by not crossing over they denied his
[1:39:17] leadership
[1:39:18] they followed it all the way up to the
[1:39:20] river jordan but when it came time to
[1:39:22] the complete giving over to god and
[1:39:24] laying their will aside and doing
[1:39:26] everything that he wanted them to do
[1:39:28] they couldn't do it
[1:39:29] they followed him through justification
[1:39:31] they followed him through sanctification
[1:39:33] they followed the message far enough to
[1:39:35] recognize the error of the denominations
[1:39:38] they followed it far enough to believe
[1:39:39] god sent a prophet
[1:39:41] they followed it far enough to stay
[1:39:42] under its protection and to stay under
[1:39:44] its anointing and its blessings and to
[1:39:46] find healing and to find deliverances
[1:39:48] they followed the leadership that far
[1:39:51] and even so far as going on to say that
[1:39:54] we've got the holy ghost
[1:39:56] but on our terms
[1:40:01] only on terms that we're comfortable
[1:40:02] with
[1:40:03] only on terms of well we received the
[1:40:05] holy ghost because we
[1:40:06] believed or we got the holy ghost
[1:40:09] because we accepted the message
[1:40:11] we received the holy ghost without
[1:40:12] experience like mary
[1:40:15] that ain't the original
[1:40:17] that's not crossing back over into the
[1:40:19] original at the original they staggered
[1:40:21] like drunk people and spoke in tongues
[1:40:26] brother branham says the mother of jesus
[1:40:29] christ had to go up there and be
[1:40:31] included in that bunch of people
[1:40:33] so drunk on the spirit till she
[1:40:34] staggered like she was drunk on whiskey
[1:40:37] or something
[1:40:38] and you think you'll get to heaven by
[1:40:39] slipping over the church and putting
[1:40:41] your song book under your arm and
[1:40:42] walking over every sunday morning and
[1:40:44] the bell tolls and you sit and listen
[1:40:47] and walk back you'll never do it you'll
[1:40:49] have to come that route because that's
[1:40:51] the only route
[1:40:54] god ever laid down and ever has
[1:40:59] we're not going to argue anyway but
[1:41:00] that's unarguable
[1:41:01] that's pretty straight and you'll walk
[1:41:04] it or you won't be there that's even
[1:41:06] straighter
[1:41:08] i'm not your judge but i'm preaching the
[1:41:10] gospel that's exactly the truth the
[1:41:12] blessed virgin was right there acted
[1:41:15] just as idiotic as the rest of them did
[1:41:20] your young people are acting like idiots
[1:41:22] yes sir
[1:41:25] i was hoping you'd say that
[1:41:28] they're just jumping and shouting and
[1:41:30] acting like idiots praise god
[1:41:33] prophet says that's the only way
[1:41:36] i didn't stutter
[1:41:38] read it just how he said it
[1:41:40] i'm preaching the gospel that's exactly
[1:41:42] the truth these men and women every one
[1:41:44] of them was full of new wine if god ever
[1:41:46] changed that program put your finger on
[1:41:48] the scripture for me it isn't there no
[1:41:51] sir it was plumb on to the end of the
[1:41:53] age that way plumb onto the end of the
[1:41:57] bible and it will be the same thing when
[1:42:00] jesus comes
[1:42:03] well brother aaron i'ma steal the line
[1:42:05] that i heard brother danny say what year
[1:42:07] did he say that
[1:42:09] in the year that he was a prophet
[1:42:15] i can guarantee you the year he said
[1:42:16] that he was a prophet
[1:42:19] he said there'd be a prophet like rise
[1:42:21] in the last days malachi 4 given the
[1:42:23] signs of the days of lot so forth also
[1:42:26] prophesying for the people to return
[1:42:28] back turn back to the faith of the first
[1:42:30] pentecostal fathers turn back to the
[1:42:32] original turn back to the bible get away
[1:42:35] from organization and denomination and
[1:42:37] go back to the first go back to the
[1:42:39] original pentecost to the original
[1:42:40] feeling of the holy ghost to the
[1:42:42] original power of god the word testifies
[1:42:45] that that will happen it shall be light
[1:42:48] in the evening time the path to glory
[1:42:50] you will surely find in waterway the
[1:42:52] light today buried in the precious name
[1:42:54] of jesus young and old repent of all
[1:42:56] your sins the holy ghost will surely
[1:42:58] enter in the evening light has come it
[1:43:01] is the fact that god and christ are one
[1:43:04] god witnesses the holy ghost the holy
[1:43:06] ghost itself living in us would never
[1:43:08] affiliate itself in organization you
[1:43:10] can't organize god he's god what will it
[1:43:13] do go back the way it was at the first
[1:43:16] place it'll go back to the beginning
[1:43:18] back to the original back to where it
[1:43:20] started from it'll baptize the same way
[1:43:23] they did it'll teach the holy ghost the
[1:43:25] same way it did they'll teach the people
[1:43:27] the same way it did it'll abstain from
[1:43:29] organization like they did it will have
[1:43:32] a room for all like they did who will
[1:43:34] come they'll be clean and holy like they
[1:43:36] did they'll be filled with the spirit
[1:43:38] like they were they'll be fearless like
[1:43:40] they were and the same things that
[1:43:42] happened to them will happen to these in
[1:43:44] the last days in the evening light like
[1:43:46] it was before
[1:43:48] i don't know how to put it any clearer
[1:43:50] but we got to cross over back into the
[1:43:52] original again
[1:43:54] that's what this exodus is about it
[1:43:56] brought us out of egypt it brought us
[1:43:57] out of the world it brought us out of
[1:43:59] denominations where is it taking us back
[1:44:01] to the original
[1:44:03] it's taking us back to the way the
[1:44:05] church was when god started it because
[1:44:07] it's the only way you can take a rapture
[1:44:10] you will not fulfill unless you come all
[1:44:12] the way back to what god intended at the
[1:44:14] beginning
[1:44:16] to the good land the holy ghost land
[1:44:18] it's a land of deliverance it's a land
[1:44:20] of the holy ghost it is a land of the
[1:44:23] supernatural
[1:44:25] anything that would turn you away from
[1:44:27] the supernatural is not of god
[1:44:30] we've got the most supernatural message
[1:44:32] that's ever struck the face of the earth
[1:44:34] and we got people denying the
[1:44:35] supernatural you don't believe the
[1:44:38] message
[1:44:43] you may believe god sent a prophet but
[1:44:44] you don't believe the message that
[1:44:46] prophet brought
[1:44:48] satan hates the supernatural
[1:44:52] he wants to keep you away from the
[1:44:54] supernatural
[1:44:56] and so what he'll do is he'll come to
[1:44:57] put doubts in your mind about the
[1:44:59] supernatural more doubts about that than
[1:45:00] anything well i wonder if it really
[1:45:02] happened in that sister the way she said
[1:45:05] i wonder if they were really sick
[1:45:06] because they well they jumped and
[1:45:08] shouted but i i've seen other people
[1:45:10] jumping shouting they were lost
[1:45:13] i've seen this and
[1:45:14] well i'm not sure those tongues yeah
[1:45:17] that interpretation i could have made
[1:45:18] that up
[1:45:22] testimonies
[1:45:23] i have found
[1:45:25] get questioned almost more than any
[1:45:27] other thing in people's heart
[1:45:30] it's i wonder if that's really how it
[1:45:32] happened
[1:45:33] because the devil wants to make you
[1:45:35] question the supernatural
[1:45:38] he wants to make you
[1:45:39] doubt the authenticity of supernatural
[1:45:42] events
[1:45:43] because it's satan's tactic to undermine
[1:45:45] the supernatural and make these things
[1:45:47] seem merely a coincidence
[1:45:49] well maybe maybe the cancer was gone
[1:45:51] sister atlanta before you ever got
[1:45:53] prayed for maybe it was just already
[1:45:54] gone
[1:45:56] maybe it really didn't have nothing to
[1:45:57] do with with the supernatural power of
[1:45:59] god maybe you know i mean she had a few
[1:46:01] treatments maybe that took care of it
[1:46:08] begins to make you wonder
[1:46:10] bends to attack the authenticity of
[1:46:12] supernatural events because it's his
[1:46:14] tactic to undermine the supernatural and
[1:46:17] make it seem a queen it says why because
[1:46:19] it's the supernatural that's going to
[1:46:20] take you out of here
[1:46:22] it's the supernatural that changes your
[1:46:24] life so if he can make you doubt the
[1:46:25] supernatural even in the level of
[1:46:27] healing then how are you going to
[1:46:29] believe for a rapture
[1:46:31] he attacks the supernatural he attacks
[1:46:33] the supernatural over and over oh it
[1:46:35] wasn't that big a deal
[1:46:37] oh if he can take you that far he'll
[1:46:39] make you believe it was entirely false
[1:46:42] and unfortunately even ministers
[1:46:44] will spend time attacking the
[1:46:46] supernatural
[1:46:47] even though they claim
[1:46:49] to be following a supernatural message
[1:46:52] and justice janice and jamborees
[1:46:54] withstood moses
[1:46:55] and tried to act like there was nothing
[1:46:57] to the miracles
[1:46:59] there was nothing to the power of god
[1:47:01] that's the job of those that would come
[1:47:02] against the supernatural
[1:47:05] what was the intent of janice and
[1:47:07] jamborees
[1:47:09] to discredit the supernatural
[1:47:11] to remove faith
[1:47:13] in the power that was going to take them
[1:47:16] out of egypt
[1:47:18] it was the supernatural that was going
[1:47:19] to take them out of egypt so let's make
[1:47:21] them believe that was just a magician's
[1:47:23] trick
[1:47:25] people get healed in the denominational
[1:47:27] church too
[1:47:29] people run and shout down to upc church
[1:47:31] all the time
[1:47:33] it's just emotion it's not it's not god
[1:47:36] there's people getting here it's nothing
[1:47:37] special
[1:47:39] it's not supernatural
[1:47:41] so they point to the to the powers and
[1:47:43] they say look we got miracles too
[1:47:46] they jump and shout too it's only
[1:47:47] emotion it's only a magician's trick
[1:47:50] but the same power that turned moses's
[1:47:53] rod into a snake was the same power that
[1:47:56] was going to plague egypt the same power
[1:47:58] that turned his rod into a snake was the
[1:48:00] power that was going to open the red sea
[1:48:02] that same power that turned his rod into
[1:48:04] a snake was the same power that was
[1:48:05] gonna rain manna down out of heaven it
[1:48:08] was the same power so they were trying
[1:48:09] to take that away from them they're
[1:48:11] trying to rob it from they're trying to
[1:48:13] point to the supernatural i say don't
[1:48:15] worry about what they're pointing to
[1:48:16] don't worry about what they're mocking
[1:48:18] the same power of god that sweeps
[1:48:19] through this building and heals our sick
[1:48:21] the same power that comes and makes you
[1:48:23] shout makes you speak in tongues the
[1:48:24] same power that makes you run around the
[1:48:26] church and dance and do the things that
[1:48:28] you do it's the same power that's gonna
[1:48:30] take us out of here it's the same power
[1:48:32] that's healing our sick it's the same
[1:48:34] power that's gonna rapture the church i
[1:48:36] say go ahead and rejoice in it i'm not
[1:48:38] worried what they say i'm not worried if
[1:48:41] other have it god bless you but it's the
[1:48:43] same power and i'm gonna worship in
[1:48:45] spirit and truth in that power it's the
[1:48:48] power that's gonna take me out of here
[1:48:51] so the enemy wants to make it seem like
[1:48:53] it's not a big deal it is the power of
[1:48:55] transformation
[1:48:57] it is the supernatural it is the
[1:48:59] rapturing power that we have to have
[1:49:02] it's what's going to take us out of here
[1:49:04] and we've reached the age of fulfillment
[1:49:07] i want to be
[1:49:09] in the place that i can fulfill all the
[1:49:12] scriptures spoken of the bride in this
[1:49:13] day
[1:49:16] i want to be where the message placed me
[1:49:23] because if i haven't allowed myself to
[1:49:24] be positionally placed
[1:49:27] then i can't operate and fulfill what
[1:49:28] the bride is called to fulfill
[1:49:31] i can't fulfill the rapture as i've said
[1:49:35] that's not going to stop the rapture
[1:49:38] those that have crossed into fulfillment
[1:49:41] back to the original
[1:49:43] they're going to take it
[1:49:45] they're going to have the rapture
[1:49:47] reuben and gad didn't stop israel from
[1:49:49] taking the land
[1:49:52] make a little turn here
[1:49:55] as we start
[1:49:56] heading for home let's go to genesis 49
[1:49:58] where we started
[1:50:03] we already read the prophecies and the
[1:50:05] blessings jacob spoke over his sons i
[1:50:07] didn't read all of them but i wrote read
[1:50:09] down through gad
[1:50:16] and we're going to look at these
[1:50:17] prophecies
[1:50:19] and in these prophecies it kind of helps
[1:50:20] us to understand
[1:50:22] why they made the choices they made
[1:50:25] and even the conduct of the tribes
[1:50:28] down through the generations and the
[1:50:30] fulfillment
[1:50:32] that comes through these tribes
[1:50:33] we're not going to go through all 12
[1:50:35] but we see that the greatest blessing by
[1:50:37] far is pronounced on judah
[1:50:40] and we know that jesus is the line of
[1:50:42] the tribe of judah
[1:50:44] he's the root in the offspring of david
[1:50:47] says he's the firstborn of many brethren
[1:50:48] colossians would tell us that he's the
[1:50:50] firstborn of every creature
[1:50:53] now nothing is by accident and we've
[1:50:54] already said that god will work
[1:50:56] everything according to his will to make
[1:50:57] his word come into fulfillment that it
[1:50:59] might be fulfilled
[1:51:01] and we have established
[1:51:03] these things in the scripture and
[1:51:05] judah is the tribe of the firstborn by
[1:51:08] assignment
[1:51:09] because reuben lost the birthright
[1:51:12] the the prophecy very clearly says
[1:51:14] reuben thou art my firstborn
[1:51:17] but he lost the birthright he was
[1:51:20] technically jacob's firstborn but he
[1:51:22] forfeited the firstborn rights
[1:51:25] of his inheritance through his
[1:51:26] misconduct
[1:51:28] and he lost them to judah you can find
[1:51:30] this in 49 genesis 49 3 and 4 also in
[1:51:33] first chronicles 5 and 1.
[1:51:35] and it is for this
[1:51:37] reason that the ruler's scepter belongs
[1:51:39] to judah and we see that in genesis 49
[1:51:42] 10.
[1:51:43] he has become the firstborn as it were
[1:51:47] 49 10 says the scepter shall not depart
[1:51:49] from judah nor a law-giver from between
[1:51:51] his feet until shiloh come and unto him
[1:51:54] shall the gathering of the people be and
[1:51:56] he receives the privileges of the
[1:51:57] firstborn right there forever
[1:52:00] and when we think of jason jacob's
[1:52:02] blessings upon his sons we have to
[1:52:04] realize that each prophetic blessing was
[1:52:07] not so much upon
[1:52:08] an individual
[1:52:10] as it was upon his future
[1:52:12] descendants
[1:52:15] it was more intended as a prophecy upon
[1:52:18] the thousands and thousands and
[1:52:19] thousands of descendants who would be
[1:52:21] born into that tribe down through the
[1:52:23] ages
[1:52:24] not only was he pronouncing the
[1:52:26] destinies of these tribes he was
[1:52:28] pronouncing the characteristics
[1:52:30] that each of these tribes would develop
[1:52:36] i'm trying to hold it in for a few more
[1:52:38] minutes
[1:52:40] and those characteristics were but
[1:52:41] extensions of the already developed and
[1:52:44] displayed characteristics of his sons
[1:52:48] he could look at the characteristics of
[1:52:50] his sons and say those that come from
[1:52:52] him are going to be just like him
[1:52:55] those that come from this one are going
[1:52:57] to act just like this one that's why i
[1:53:00] can look down through time and tell you
[1:53:02] what they're going to do and tell you
[1:53:04] where they're going to fall short and
[1:53:05] tell you where they're going to fail but
[1:53:07] i can also tell you who's going to
[1:53:08] overcome
[1:53:11] genesis 49 3 he says reuben
[1:53:14] thou art my firstborn
[1:53:16] my might and the beginning of my
[1:53:18] strength the excellency of dignity and
[1:53:21] the excellency of power it sounds
[1:53:24] good
[1:53:25] next verse
[1:53:28] unstable as water
[1:53:31] this is characteristic
[1:53:33] that's his
[1:53:35] most dominating characteristic it's the
[1:53:37] first thing he calls out
[1:53:39] because thou unstable is water thou
[1:53:42] shalt not
[1:53:43] excel
[1:53:47] unstable
[1:53:48] makes bad decisions
[1:53:50] like not crossing over
[1:53:53] will never excel because he makes bad
[1:53:56] decisions
[1:53:57] because he is unstable as water
[1:54:00] you know family cycles been around a lot
[1:54:02] longer than what you realize
[1:54:06] imagine growing up
[1:54:09] in the tribe under this prophecy every
[1:54:13] generation after every generation after
[1:54:14] every generation after every generation
[1:54:18] you had to be a real cycle breaker to
[1:54:21] even excel coming out of this tribe
[1:54:25] as we all have cycles to break
[1:54:27] we all have things we have to battle
[1:54:30] don't let it stop you
[1:54:32] don't look back at your family history
[1:54:34] and say we failed we failed we failed so
[1:54:37] i'm going to fail
[1:54:39] now
[1:54:39] be a cycle breaker
[1:54:42] look every age has went down the cycle
[1:54:44] of revival and death revival and death
[1:54:45] revival and death but somebody's going
[1:54:47] to be revival and rapture
[1:54:49] somebody's got to break that cycle
[1:54:51] somebody's got to break the cycle
[1:54:53] when it comes to your natural family be
[1:54:55] a cycle breaker
[1:54:56] genesis 49 19 gad
[1:54:59] a troop shall overcome him but he shall
[1:55:02] overcome at the last it's like i believe
[1:55:04] it's the shortest of all the prophecies
[1:55:06] and blessings
[1:55:08] i can imagine sitting there waiting on
[1:55:10] your blessing
[1:55:12] and
[1:55:15] what's that mean
[1:55:19] can you imagine waiting on your
[1:55:20] inheritance
[1:55:22] a troop's gonna overcome you
[1:55:24] you're gonna overcome at the last
[1:55:26] how am i gonna get am i gonna inherit
[1:55:28] anything
[1:55:31] what's going to happen what is actually
[1:55:33] speaking of if you dig down into it is
[1:55:35] it speaking of the fact that god is
[1:55:36] going to become a great military tribe
[1:55:38] and they were they were fierce warriors
[1:55:40] but the reason they became such
[1:55:43] of a great military tribe is because
[1:55:45] they were constantly attacked
[1:55:47] they were constantly attacked their
[1:55:49] entire lineage is that they're in battle
[1:55:52] after battle after battle and they have
[1:55:55] to fight off all the enemies all of
[1:55:57] their days because of their
[1:56:00] location
[1:56:02] because they chose to settle outside the
[1:56:05] promised land they were constantly
[1:56:07] attacked they would struggle through
[1:56:08] life constantly attack because they
[1:56:10] settled short and it says in the end
[1:56:12] they will usually win
[1:56:15] most of the time they'll prevail but
[1:56:17] notice they're fighting battles and
[1:56:19] enduring raids that they didn't have to
[1:56:21] fight
[1:56:22] they're struggling to find victory
[1:56:24] they're struggling to stay afloat
[1:56:26] they're attacked on all sides because of
[1:56:28] where they settled the prophecy saw them
[1:56:30] there the prophecy was spoke over from
[1:56:33] you're barely going to make it you're
[1:56:34] going to struggle you're going to fight
[1:56:36] yes in the end you're probably going to
[1:56:38] make it by the skin of your teeth but
[1:56:39] you didn't have to settle there in the
[1:56:41] first place you could have crossed over
[1:56:43] and possessed it all when you had the
[1:56:45] opportunity and the prophecy placed them
[1:56:48] there and saw them there the prophecy
[1:56:50] saw that reuben would never succeed
[1:56:53] never excel in generation after
[1:56:55] generation will walk underneath this
[1:56:56] prophecy
[1:56:57] as the characteristics of that patriarch
[1:57:00] of their tribe would play out into a
[1:57:02] fulfillment in their lives
[1:57:04] the characteristics of the patriarch of
[1:57:07] their tribe would play out in a
[1:57:10] fulfillment
[1:57:11] in their lives
[1:57:13] oh surely you see where we're going
[1:57:15] surely you see where we're going the
[1:57:17] characteristics of the sons of jacob
[1:57:18] were passed down into the tribes and the
[1:57:20] prophecies proved true as they failed to
[1:57:23] fulfill all that they were called to do
[1:57:25] as they failed to cross over but there
[1:57:28] is a people called to fulfill all
[1:57:31] there is a people on the earth today
[1:57:33] that in spite of satan's best efforts
[1:57:35] have followed the message not only to
[1:57:37] the river but they are crossing over the
[1:57:40] river
[1:57:41] i'm not looking to the characteristics
[1:57:44] of one of the tribes of jacob i'm
[1:57:46] looking to the characteristics of the
[1:57:48] lord jesus christ let me tell you about
[1:57:52] my jesus he didn't stop short he
[1:57:55] conquered all he conquered death he
[1:57:58] conquered hell so what am i going to do
[1:58:00] when i manifest the characteristics of
[1:58:03] my father and the prophecy that's been
[1:58:06] spoke over me
[1:58:08] i'm gonna have it all
[1:58:10] i'm gonna take it all i'm gonna possess
[1:58:13] all
[1:58:14] glory
[1:58:22] i can't help it i can't help my genetics
[1:58:26] that's my papa
[1:58:28] that's my daddy that's what he did he
[1:58:31] overcame he was victorious
[1:58:34] the devil offered him land on this side
[1:58:36] of the river
[1:58:37] he said you don't got to cross over
[1:58:39] chili jordan i'll give you the kingdoms
[1:58:42] you know it's kind of hard to rob
[1:58:43] somebody with something they're going to
[1:58:44] get anyway
[1:58:47] yeah you can't bribe me look what i'm
[1:58:49] about to get i can't stop short look
[1:58:51] what i'm about to get i'm about to have
[1:58:54] a new body i'm about to have a rapture
[1:58:56] i'm about to have eternal life you got
[1:58:59] nothing i want
[1:59:00] you got nothing i want and if you do
[1:59:03] i'll just take it from you
[1:59:06] hallelujah
[1:59:16] hallelujah
[1:59:23] he didn't settle short
[1:59:28] that's where i trace my lineage back to
[1:59:31] where he conquered
[1:59:32] i'm a conqueror
[1:59:34] where he overcame i'm gonna overcome
[1:59:37] because he's my father
[1:59:39] the word why do you think they can say
[1:59:40] the works that i do
[1:59:43] shall you do
[1:59:44] also
[1:59:45] how many of us have seen the
[1:59:46] characteristics of our natural parents
[1:59:48] in our everyday life
[1:59:51] because you're going to be like them
[1:59:54] and the same thing applies in the
[1:59:56] spiritual
[1:59:57] there was a prophecy spoken over jacob's
[1:59:59] son
[2:00:00] and there's been a prophecy spoken over
[2:00:02] you
[2:00:05] the prophecy claims you
[2:00:09] oh thank you god
[2:00:10] the prophecy has claimed you
[2:00:13] satan tries to lame claim to you and
[2:00:14] says that you're mine
[2:00:16] you belong to me
[2:00:18] everything you got is mine but the
[2:00:20] prophecy claims you as a sea gene of god
[2:00:22] this prophetic message called your name
[2:00:25] daddy told you who you are
[2:00:28] it was a message straight from the
[2:00:29] throne if somebody else says daddy tells
[2:00:31] me where i came from i don't really care
[2:00:34] you wasn't there
[2:00:36] you don't know and even if you know some
[2:00:37] of the truth you probably got it mixed
[2:00:39] up and you don't know all the details
[2:00:41] like satan's message i don't listen to
[2:00:43] he's not my daddy
[2:00:45] he's not my father i'm not listening to
[2:00:47] it this message called your name this
[2:00:50] message called you to fulfill everything
[2:00:52] you saw this message and you said mama
[2:00:55] that's me
[2:00:56] that's me right there that's what's
[2:00:58] calling my name look all i had to do was

[2:01:10] it is what it is
[2:01:13] all you got to do is eat and you're
[2:01:14] going to manifest the genetics on the
[2:01:16] inside of you
[2:01:21] all you got to do is eat
[2:01:23] all you got to do is feed on it there's
[2:01:25] something on the inside it's going to
[2:01:26] start to manifest the genetics on the
[2:01:29] inside of you oh hallelujah just start

[2:02:40] everlasting life raise him up
[2:02:43] in the last day

[2:06:06] all the words got to be fulfilled
[2:06:09] and we are the lights of the day and
[2:06:11] it's up to us to fulfill all this
[2:06:15] and i know that your righteousness and
[2:06:16] your desire is to fulfill the word
[2:06:19] it's becoming to us we are the lights
[2:06:22] the light of every age should do the
[2:06:23] same thing
[2:06:24] we know what's got to be fulfilled
[2:06:27] you who are spiritual and know the word
[2:06:29] of god you see what god has promised
[2:06:34] as we walk in the evening like church
[2:06:36] we got to press harder than ever before
[2:06:39] we got to press into that land of
[2:06:41] fulfillment
[2:06:42] it's getting harder and harder brother
[2:06:43] brown says the word don't always come
[2:06:45] easy
[2:06:46] the fulfillment don't always come easy
[2:06:48] but we got to be willing to press in
[2:06:51] the musicians can come as i finish this
[2:06:56] we are claimed by an eternal word
[2:07:00] to be the final serpent bruisers
[2:07:03] the final
[2:07:05] serpent bruisers
[2:07:08] we are the very instrument that god will
[2:07:11] use to fulfill all
[2:07:13] that was written in the new testament
[2:07:15] i hope i was able to get it across today
[2:07:17] we're not just looking for fulfillment
[2:07:18] we're looking to fulfill
[2:07:21] we must go and fulfill
[2:07:25] i got a few quotes i'd like to read
[2:07:27] they're just too good not to read
[2:07:30] now the only way to be a to live a life
[2:07:32] worthy is to let christ and his word
[2:07:35] reflect itself so perfect in you till
[2:07:37] god vindicates what he said in the word
[2:07:39] for christ died that he might present
[2:07:41] himself before god a sacrifice and
[2:07:42] return back in the form of the holy
[2:07:44] ghost to reflect himself through his
[2:07:46] people to carry on his work reflecting
[2:07:49] himself through you to fulfill his
[2:07:51] promised word in these future days
[2:07:54] like john the baptist heard
[2:07:58] brother brown tell stories in a way that
[2:08:00] don't come from one's imagination
[2:08:02] come from one who saw it
[2:08:05] like john the baptist heard when he
[2:08:07] heard christ come
[2:08:08] and christ walked out into the water and
[2:08:10] john said behold the lamb of god
[2:08:12] nobody else saw it but he saw it that
[2:08:14] light coming down from heaven like a
[2:08:16] dove and a voice saying this is my
[2:08:17] beloved son and whom i'm pleased to
[2:08:19] dwell in he saw it coming and jesus
[2:08:22] walked out into the water emmanuel
[2:08:24] before a preacher that was supposed to
[2:08:26] be a radical
[2:08:28] walked out into the water before the
[2:08:30] people and said i need to be baptized of
[2:08:32] you
[2:08:33] john said lord i have need to be
[2:08:34] baptized of thee why cometh out of me
[2:08:38] both of them eyes met one another
[2:08:40] a prophet and his god
[2:08:42] amen
[2:08:44] i would love to stand and watch that see
[2:08:47] them stern deep said eyes of john peel
[2:08:49] down and find them stern deep set eyes
[2:08:52] of jesus second cousins to one another
[2:08:54] in the flesh
[2:08:55] jesus said john
[2:08:57] suffer it to be so now
[2:08:59] for thus it behooves us
[2:09:01] we're the message of this hour
[2:09:03] it behooveth us to fulfill the
[2:09:05] righteousness
[2:09:07] we're the message of this hour
[2:09:10] it behooveth us to fill
[2:09:13] feel righteousness
[2:09:14] brother aaron i'm not so sure i can make
[2:09:16] it
[2:09:18] i know you're gonna make it
[2:09:20] you've been claimed by a prophecy it's
[2:09:23] not reuben's prophecy it's not a
[2:09:24] prophecy of god
[2:09:27] i descend from the lord jesus christ
[2:09:29] himself the royal seed of abraham
[2:09:32] the royal seed that will not fall
[2:09:35] we are the message
[2:09:37] of this hour
[2:09:38] and he's called you to fulfill all he's
[2:09:41] called you to cross over into
[2:09:42] fulfillment
[2:09:44] he could have called billions and
[2:09:45] billions and millions of other people
[2:09:48] he could have called important people
[2:09:50] he could have called presidents and
[2:09:52] governors and princes and
[2:09:56] he called you
[2:10:01] he called me
[2:10:03] he could have called anyone
[2:10:07] but he called you
[2:10:09] he said they'll fulfill it
[2:10:12] they'll do the work i've got confidence
[2:10:15] in them
[2:10:16] you say i've got confidence in my god
[2:10:19] he's got confidence in you
[2:10:21] it behooves us to fulfill
[2:10:24] all
[2:10:26] righteousness but what about this and
[2:10:29] what about that the world's falling
[2:10:30] apart god's words gonna be fulfilled
[2:10:33] he couldn't stop jesus
[2:10:36] from fulfilling every word that spoke of
[2:10:38] him in the old testament
[2:10:41] and every word that speaks of the groom
[2:10:43] speaks of the bride
[2:10:45] he can't stop you from fulfilling every
[2:10:48] word in the new testament

[2:10:52] everything in the new testament
[2:10:57] all of it
[2:10:59] that applies

[2:11:04] years god has been again making him a
[2:11:06] masterpiece
[2:11:08] because he struck him to get a piece off
[2:11:10] of him a rib to make a wife for him and
