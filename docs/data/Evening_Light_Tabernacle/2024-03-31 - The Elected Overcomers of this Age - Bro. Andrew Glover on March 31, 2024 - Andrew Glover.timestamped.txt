[43:15] not come here tonight amen to elect a
[43:17] man amen but we have come here to elect
[43:20] a man and that is the man the Lord Jesus
[43:23] he said I'm trying to build a platform
[43:24] for him tonight that in the coming
[43:26] nights of this campaign that we might
[43:28] rejoice and praise His name because we
[43:31] have elected him Amen in our hearts to
[43:34] be our savior to be our God and to be
[43:36] our healer amen let me say this I
[43:39] believe that there is a bride here this
[43:41] morning amen that has elected Jesus
[43:43] Christ amen not just to be their savior
[43:46] not just to be their healer amen but
[43:48] they have elected him to be the Lord of

[44:09] that's in you amen has already overcome
[44:12] the world listen we may be in the world
[44:14] but we are not of the world Amen but be
[44:17] of good cheer for I have overcome the
[44:19] world Amen and the one that's in you has
[44:22] overcome everything in your future and
[44:25] if he overcome then so shall you come on
[44:28] Caleb amen we're we're following Joshua
[44:31] right amen and we're going to take our
[44:33] mountains we're going to take our lands
[44:35] we're going to take our healings we're
[44:37] going to take our victories we're going
[44:38] to we're going to overcome we're going
[44:40] to tear down amen I believe it I believe
[44:43] the Bible said that Caleb amen was a
[44:46] type showed us from from the Bible that
[44:48] Caleb was a type of the end time people
[44:51] amen that follow Joshua the leader in
[44:53] numbers 13:30 the Bible says that Caleb
[44:56] stealed the people before Moses and he
[44:58] said let us go up at once and possess it
[45:02] now watch what he says amen for we might
[45:04] be able to overcome it there is a
[45:06] possibility that we can overcome it amen
[45:09] amen amen there is a way that we might
[45:11] scheme up that we might be able to
[45:13] overcome amen not my Bible says amen
[45:16] that we are well
[45:19] aable we are well able to overcome it
[45:23] now look at this word overcome it means
[45:25] to endure it means to have power it
[45:28] means to be able to gain to accomplish
[45:30] to be able to endure it means to be able
[45:33] to reach to Prevail over or against
[45:36] something it means to overcome it means
[45:38] to be the Victor to have ability to have
[45:41] strength now think about this amen Caleb
[45:44] was an overcomer but can I say this
[45:46] Caleb did not start overcoming amen the
[45:49] day that he took his Mountain Caleb did
[45:52] not start overcoming amen the day that
[45:54] he be to walk in the inheritance amen
[45:57] that Moses said he could have amen but
[45:59] from the time that Moses said amen there
[46:02] is a mountain for you to have until he
[46:04] put his foot up on that mountain amen
[46:07] Caleb overcome listen friends and the
[46:09] way he overcome was he endured amen
[46:12] every day with the promises of God
[46:15] listen I say I am looking at a young
[46:17] generation amen that's not going to
[46:19] start overcoming on the morning of the
[46:21] Rapture or when they get into heaven
[46:23] amen but I believe you've been enduring
[46:26] you've been pers fearing you have been
[46:28] believing the promises of God in the
[46:30] face of every devil you've been reaching
[46:32] beyond what Satan has said about you
[46:35] you've been reaching beyond what people
[46:36] have thought about you listen you've
[46:38] been enduring and if you can just hold
[46:40] on Amen you're going to take your
[46:42] mountain and devils in hell to defeat
[46:45] you and do it listen Joshua and Caleb
[46:47] took the land amen because they believe
[46:49] the word no matter what and then no
[46:52] matter what they believe the word if
[46:54] they felt good they believe the word if
[46:57] they didn't feel good they believe the
[46:58] word why because they were elected to
[47:01] overcome and to possess the promises
[47:04] that God had given them in 1 John chap
[47:07] 2: 13 the Bible says I write unto you
[47:09] fathers because you have known him that
[47:11] is from the beginning amen I write unto
[47:14] you young men amen because ye have
[47:17] overcome the wicked one I want you to
[47:20] notice how John is writing this amen I
[47:22] write unto you little children amen
[47:24] because you have known the father now
[47:26] now can I can I break something down to
[47:28] you amen John is writing this as if it's
[47:31] already happened amen he's writing this
[47:34] amen as if you've already overcome he's
[47:37] writing this as if you've already met
[47:39] the father amen and and now now think
[47:41] about this amen how could John write
[47:44] that Amen in past tense amen and when
[47:47] John wrote that young men you wasn't
[47:48] even
[47:50] born come on Church am me you weren't
[47:53] even born when John rofan he goes on the
[47:55] 14th verse and says I have written unto
[47:57] you fathers because you have known him
[48:00] that is from the beginning I have
[48:02] written unto you young men how many
[48:04] young men have I got here this morning
[48:06] amen he wrote unto you young men amen
[48:08] because you are weak and you cannot hold
[48:10] on and you cannot persevere no that's
[48:13] what they ought to see a Bible says but
[48:15] my Bible says because ye are strong amen
[48:19] and the word of God abideth in you and
[48:22] ye have overcome the wicked one are
[48:25] y'all catching what is saying he's
[48:28] saying that there is a generation amen
[48:30] that's going to be strong look at this
[48:32] word strong it is of one who has the
[48:35] strength of the Soul Amen to sustain the
[48:38] attacks of the devil amen I want to put
[48:40] hell on notice this morning amen you can
[48:43] throw everything you've got against us
[48:45] amen but we are the elected Overcomers
[48:48] amen by the word of almighty God we have
[48:51] not come from a church we have not come
[48:53] from a denomination amen but we have
[48:55] stepped from the genes of almighty God
[48:58] into this generation listen I did oh God
[49:01] Amen I'm only catching up in time with
[49:04] what God seen me doing in eternity amen
[49:07] and God sent John to write unto me and
[49:10] say I'm going to overcome leosia I'm
[49:12] going to overcome lukewarmness I'm going
[49:14] to overcome depression I'm going to
[49:16] overcome anxiety I'm going to overcome
[49:19] complexes amen and here's how I'm going
[49:21] to do it because the word of God Amen is
[49:24] abiding in my soul I I am not a
[49:27] Christian by my flesh I am not a
[49:29] Christian by my spirit come on church
[49:32] amen you got to be a Christian from your
[49:34] soul where the first attack of the devil
[49:36] is going to knock you out come on church
[49:40] amen we got a bunch of Flesh Christians
[49:41] in the world we got a bunch of spirit
[49:43] Christians amen but I'm talking about
[49:45] some soul Christians y y'all realize the
[49:48] prophet of God said he said there's
[49:50] three kinds of Believers he said there's
[49:51] a make believer an unbeliever and a
[49:53] genuine believer he said there's three
[49:55] kinds of believers in every church now
[49:58] think about that one amen there's three
[50:00] kinds of Believers in every church can I
[50:02] say this to you there's three kinds of
[50:04] Believers in every
[50:07] believer come on now amen do you realize
[50:10] your flesh is an unbeliever your flesh
[50:12] is what didn't want to get out of bed
[50:14] this morning your flesh is what's trying
[50:16] to put you to sleep right now your flesh
[50:18] is what don't want you to raise your
[50:20] hand and say amen amen your flesh is
[50:22] what didn't want Michael to sing amen
[50:24] your flesh is what saying the sound
[50:26] system too loud your flesh right now is
[50:29] what's saying oh hurry up we've been
[50:30] here all weekend are you hearing me your
[50:32] flesh is an unbeliever your flesh will
[50:34] work against you your flesh will war
[50:36] against you amen listen your flesh is a
[50:39] come on it's a product amen of a
[50:41] hybridized affair amen your flesh is an
[50:44] unbeliever so you cannot serve God based
[50:46] on your flesh amen can I go a step
[50:48] further amen you got a spirit amen and
[50:51] if everything's good and there's no
[50:53] trouble there's no situation amen you'll
[50:55] serve God as a Spirit Christian but the
[50:58] very minute that something bad happens
[51:00] amen your spirit can drop from the highs
[51:02] of highs into the lows of lows amen your
[51:05] spirit is a make believer amen your
[51:07] spirit will make you believe
[51:08] everything's going good and then when
[51:10] something goes bad God's against you
[51:12] amen but can I say this we are not flesh
[51:15] Christians we are not Spirit Christians
[51:17] but we are soul Christians amen We
[51:19] Believe from our soul we worship from
[51:22] our soul we preach from our soul we sing
[51:24] from our soul we confess the word of God
[51:27] Amen from our soul when our flesh don't
[51:29] want to praise our soul Praises anyhow
[51:32] when our spirit says I'm too low amen
[51:34] our soul Praises anyhow and I want to
[51:36] say this this morning it's your flesh
[51:39] amen that says you're not going to make
[51:40] a Rapture it's your flesh it says God
[51:43] can't change your body but you know what
[51:45] I say there is a soul on the inside of
[51:47] you as a Believer and there is an
[51:49] anointed word that is laying across that
[51:51] soul and that word is bringing your
[51:54] flesh into subjection to the promise of
[51:56] God and some of these mornings between
[51:59] 6:00 and 9 there's going to come A
[52:01] Change across your body and your flesh
[52:04] won't stop it and your spirit won't stop
[52:06] it because there is a soul that the word
[52:09] of God has been laid
[52:11] into and it is strong enough to sustain
[52:15] the attacks of the devil I love what
[52:18] John goes on to say in 1 John 5:4 he
[52:20] says whatsoever is born of God Amen how
[52:23] many here is born of God are you ready
[52:26] for this
[52:27] overcometh the
[52:29] world now that's not a possibility young
[52:33] people that is a promise whatever is
[52:36] born of
[52:39] God
[52:40] overcomes the world that is the victory
[52:44] that overcometh the world even our faith
[52:47] amen I'm going to preach in a minute I'm
[52:49] just laying some Foundation right now
[52:50] look at this word world it is the
[52:52] ungodly multitude it is the whole mass
[52:55] of men amen alienated from God and
[52:58] therefore hostile to the cause of Christ
[53:02] so the entire the entire massive
[53:04] humanity is alienated from God but
[53:07] they're not just alienated but they're
[53:09] actually hostile amen towards the cause
[53:12] of Christ but now watch this brother the
[53:14] whole circle of Earthly Goods amen
[53:17] endowments riches advantages Pleasures
[53:20] which allthough hallow and frail and
[53:22] fleeting now think about this the world
[53:24] is full of riches advantages Pleasures
[53:27] but they're hallow they're frail and
[53:29] they're fleeting amen they stir desire
[53:32] now watch what they do and they seduce
[53:34] from God Amen and are obstacles to the
[53:36] cause of Christ so there are things in
[53:39] the world that the devil will put before
[53:42] you amen that'll be Hollow they'll be
[53:44] frail but listen they'll still be strong
[53:47] enough Amen to seduce some amen and pull
[53:50] them from the cause of Christ amen but I
[53:52] want to say I am not talking to that
[53:54] category of people this morning I am
[53:56] talking to the sons of God who have been
[53:59] born by the word of God and here's what
[54:01] the Bible said who is he that overcometh
[54:03] the world Amen but he that believeth
[54:06] Jesus is the son of God and I want to
[54:09] climb up on the highest of highest this
[54:11] morning and say Lord Jesus Is God there
[54:14] is no God above him there is no God
[54:16] beside him there is no God with him amen
[54:20] he is God and he is God
[54:22] alone we might as well preach this
[54:24] morning we're here amen I believe I'm
[54:26] talking to some Overcomers amen now
[54:28] watch this quote the prod God said now
[54:30] Faith is a conqueror amen faith is an
[54:33] overcomer it isn't just a peacemaker it
[54:36] overcomes amen faith is the victory that
[54:40] overcomes the world Amen what does it do
[54:43] what is Faith what is the conquer amen
[54:45] conquer and victory is the same are you
[54:47] ready for a prophetic definition Amen to
[54:50] conquer it means that to beat down are
[54:53] you with me to override to hand cuff and
[54:57] throw into
[54:58] prison now you are a generation who's
[55:02] going to beat down the advantages of
[55:04] Leota you're going to handcuff the
[55:06] desires of leosa come on Church you're
[55:09] going to override amen the things of
[55:12] worldism and Fashions and ideas of
[55:15] ungodly things you are this generation
[55:18] and you know what you're going to do
[55:19] you're going to throw it into prison now
[55:21] can I say this amen before you got to
[55:24] Jesus Christ amen you was in that that

[57:30] I'm here am amen a prophet of God said a
[57:32] Believer marries an unbeliever under no
[57:35] conditions amen and some of you may have
[57:37] to go home and end some relationships
[57:39] but if you want to keep this revival
[57:41] amen burning in your soul you're going
[57:43] to have to separate from everything
[57:44] that's hallow everything that's frail
[57:47] everything that will seduce you amen
[57:49] away from the cause of Christ you're
[57:50] going to have to separate because God's
[57:53] word calls amen for a total separation
[57:56] from
[57:58] unbelief both things can stay the same
[58:02] when the Overcomer comes in you may have
[58:04] to overcome some
[58:06] friendships you may have to go home and
[58:08] tell some coaches I ain't wearing shorts

[58:25] the the word of God is abiding in you
[58:28] and listen now comes the fight the fight
[58:31] ain't when you're at Camp amen the fight
[58:33] is when you leave and every devil raises
[58:35] its head and tries to tell you you
[58:37] didn't get nothing it was just an
[58:38] emotion it was just a sensation amen
[58:41] that's where the battle begins that's
[58:43] where you've got to override that devil
[58:45] you got to beat that devil down you got
[58:47] to handcuff that devil and throw that
[58:50] devil in prison and say I know what I
[58:52] got in the presence of the Lord it was
[58:54] More Than A Feeling it was more than an
[58:57] emotion it was more than a sensation but
[58:59] I got a deposit of the baptism of the
[59:02] Holy Ghost In My Soul the Overcomer is
[59:05] now living in me and I can overcome on
[59:08] every occasion I can overcome in every

[59:27] defeated Christian you are a son and a
[59:30] daughter of God you are an overcomer now
[59:32] you have to separate from some
[59:35] things but the problem of God said now
[59:37] it's not the actual thought of how much
[59:39] what we are to overcome but how we are
[59:42] to overcome see if I if I took here this
[59:45] morning now look if I if I put up a list

[1:01:05] runthe and walk on with a perfect
[1:01:08] satisfied faith that what God has
[1:01:10] promised you is able to perform not
[1:01:12] joining one denomination another
[1:01:14] denomination running this that or the

[1:01:50] to overcome you are the elected ones to
[1:01:53] do

[1:01:56] brother said watch he said we're not
[1:01:57] talking so much about on my Throne amen
[1:02:00] is in my Throne he said Christ is the
[1:02:02] ruler the throne ruler at this time of
[1:02:03] the complete domain of God so will the
[1:02:05] church be with him the bride be with him
[1:02:07] and his throne in his entire domain see
[1:02:10] a throne is over a domain and a domain
[1:02:13] reaches just as far as its boundaries
[1:02:15] does and this is from eternity to
[1:02:17] Eternity can I say this as a Believer we
[1:02:20] have a dominion and according to Romans
[1:02:22] 6 for sin shall not have aen dominion
[1:02:26] over you for ye are not under law but
[1:02:29] under grace can I say this our Dominion
[1:02:32] is the dominion over sin amen and it is
[1:02:35] enforced through the power that is in
[1:02:37] the spirit of Christ that indwells us
[1:02:40] amen every Kingdom on Earth is going to
[1:02:43] be torn down amen but ours will remain
[1:02:47] Hallelujah every Kingdom on the Earth is
[1:02:50] going to be tored down amen but ours
[1:02:52] will remain now can I say this to you

[1:02:56] of us amen as Kings and Priests amen but
[1:03:00] listen it speaks of us as kings in the
[1:03:02] future tent amen so in the future
[1:03:05] according to Revelations 1 amen we're
[1:03:07] going to be Kings and Priests under God
[1:03:09] but in Revelation 1 15 the Bible says
[1:03:11] from Jesus Christ who is the faithful
[1:03:14] witness the first begotten of the Dead
[1:03:16] the prince of the kings of the earth
[1:03:17] unto him that loved us and wased us from
[1:03:20] our sins and his own blood and hath made
[1:03:22] us amen Kings and Priests unto God and
[1:03:25] his father to him be glory and Dominion
[1:03:28] forever and ever amen but said now watch
[1:03:31] this he hath made us can we say that
[1:03:33] together he hath made us he said there's
[1:03:36] certain truths that we need to emphasize
[1:03:38] on and this is one of them that he hath
[1:03:41] made us listen you did not make yourself
[1:03:44] an overcomer amen he made you an
[1:03:47] overcomer you did not make yourself
[1:03:49] saved he saved you because salvation is
[1:03:52] of the lord it's of his doing listen we
[1:03:55] are going to be Kings upon the Earth
[1:03:57] with him when he sits on his throne so
[1:03:59] now what do we do do we just look at the
[1:04:01] future and say someday some hour amen
[1:04:04] sometime Amen Brother Jay we're going to
[1:04:06] be a king amen someday the power is
[1:04:09] going to come and we're going to be a
[1:04:10] king I say what a prophet said he said
[1:04:12] we're going to be kings in the future he
[1:04:15] said but right now amen We Are Spiritual
[1:04:18] Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual
[1:04:21] Kingdom amen right now we reign with
[1:04:23] Christ and we have Dom dominion over sin
[1:04:27] over the world over the Flesh and the
[1:04:30] devil and we are showing forth his
[1:04:32] praise and His glory we are showing
[1:04:34] forth himself for it is Christ in US

[1:05:00] the age of the Overcomer Canan does not
[1:05:02] represent the age of the Overcomer or
[1:05:04] Millennium rather it only represents the
[1:05:06] age of the Overcomer this is the
[1:05:09] dispensation of overcoming because in
[1:05:12] Canaan amen they killed and they burned
[1:05:15] and they took cities now listen people

[1:05:19] Millennium brother said no he said that

[1:06:23] to fight that Devil with your praise
[1:06:25] when you don't feel like praising when

[1:08:04] the Sue right now he said because it's a
[1:08:07] sacred time for them they're in a feast

[1:08:18] we know today is custard as custards
[1:08:20] Last Stand are you hearing me amen he
[1:08:23] picked the wrong time to go among the
[1:08:27] sue you know why because they were in
[1:08:30] worship they were in a dedication they
[1:08:32] were in a feast and the devil come among
[1:08:35] them and brother said he whipped them
[1:08:37] amen and it was Custer Last Stand can I
[1:08:39] say this to you amen the devil has pick
[1:08:41] the wrong time to come amongst the Bride
[1:08:43] of Jesus Christ he has picked the wrong
[1:08:46] time to come among our meetings he has
[1:08:48] picked the wrong time to come into our
[1:08:50] churches because we're not here as a
[1:08:52] bunch of church members playing Church
[1:08:54] Hallelujah amen our Revival does not end
[1:08:57] when the Music Stops our Revival does
[1:09:00] not end when the music quits playing
[1:09:02] amen our Revival is a word Revival and
[1:09:05] it burns on the mountain and it burns in
[1:09:07] the valley it burns in the good times it
[1:09:10] burns in the bad times we are not in
[1:09:12] just a church service we are in a
[1:09:14] spiritual Feast where the King of Kings
[1:09:17] we are feeding on the unfailing body
[1:09:19] word of the son of man and it is
[1:09:21] releasing a strength on the inside of us
[1:09:24] to overcome every devil to overcome
[1:09:26] every idea to overcome every tradition
[1:09:29] you know what I say I say release your
[1:09:31] worship release your weapon release your
[1:09:34] praise release the anointing of the Holy
[1:09:37] Ghost upon the lives of the children of
[1:09:38] God and let him just show forth his
[1:09:41] Praises he made you to praise him now
[1:09:45] think about this the part of God said
[1:09:47] like this the time we have to fight to
[1:09:49] win the battle and to overcome the
[1:09:52] things of the world now is the time you
[1:09:54] know we're living in a very special
[1:09:57] time amen I'm I'm getting ready to go to
[1:09:59] war so stay with me we're living in a
[1:10:02] very special time it's called adoption
[1:10:05] time the Bible speaks of it Romans 8:14
[1:10:08] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:10:10] God they are the sons of God verse 15
[1:10:13] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:10:15] bondage again to fear but ye have
[1:10:19] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:10:22] ye cry Abby father ye have not received
[1:10:26] the spirit of bondage again to fear but
[1:10:29] you have received the spirit of adoption
[1:10:32] whereby we cry AB by father now if
[1:10:35] you're crying father you know what that
[1:10:37] means that means you have claims on him
[1:10:39] as a child and him is your father if you
[1:10:42] are saying father come on church if
[1:10:45] you're saying father that means you have
[1:10:47] been moved amen from the fear and scare
[1:10:50] that you don't know who you are well I
[1:10:52] might as well just read you what a
[1:10:53] prophet of God said he said I'm only
[1:10:55] saying this amen not to mix up Doctrine
[1:10:58] but to straighten it out that we might
[1:11:00] get away from this fear and scare that
[1:11:03] you don't know who you are you are not
[1:11:06] going to be sons of God but see you but
[1:11:10] now you are the sons of God listen this
[1:11:13] is not in the future this is not way out
[1:11:15] there somewhere someday some hour no but
[1:11:19] right now you are the sons of God see
[1:11:22] can I say what a prophet said brother
[1:11:24] Titus he said you always were a Son of
[1:11:26] God if you ever was a Son of God you
[1:11:29] always were a Son of God well I might as
[1:11:31] well draw my sword and preach here you
[1:11:33] say preacher why are you bogging down on
[1:11:35] this point amen because somewhere
[1:11:37] sometime you've got to come to a victory
[1:11:40] on the Battle of whether I'm a Child of
[1:11:41] God or
[1:11:44] not testing one two it's still working
[1:11:46] somewhere sometime you've got to settle
[1:11:49] it either you're a Son of God or you're
[1:11:52] not a son of God listen you say preacher
[1:11:54] why are you why are you bogging down
[1:11:55] here because you got bigger battles to
[1:11:58] fight than just waking up every day
[1:12:00] wondering if I'm a Child of God or not
[1:12:02] you got bigger cities to burn down you
[1:12:04] got bigger Giants to take land from
[1:12:07] somewhere sometime you got to settle
[1:12:09] whether you're a child of God or
[1:12:12] not well glory to God he said brother if
[1:12:15] I wake up feeling good I'm a Child of
[1:12:16] God but if I wake up feeling bad I don't
[1:12:18] know you realize the devil will have you
[1:12:20] running in circles well one day I'm
[1:12:22] saved the next day I'm lost one day I'm

[1:19:02] elected amen based on your home You're
[1:19:05] Not Elected based on your church listen
[1:19:07] can I say this You're Not Elected based
[1:19:10] on your own character or your own
[1:19:11] mistakes you are elected by the for
[1:19:14] knowledge of God wherein he decided to
[1:19:17] elect to choose to pick out now watch
[1:19:21] what he done he elected you before the
[1:19:23] foundation of the world and he desired
[1:19:26] that you would receive certain blessings
[1:19:28] in other words before you got here God
[1:19:30] decreed you would receive the blessings
[1:19:32] you're receiving from before the
[1:19:35] foundation of the world listen in other
[1:19:37] words it's got your name on it come on
[1:19:40] church it's got your name on it and
[1:19:42] there ain't no devil and there ain't no
[1:19:44] Spirit there ain't no
[1:19:48] unbelief are you hearing me I tell you
[1:19:50] why that's so real to me amen I borrowed
[1:19:52] that example from brother brother Wayne
[1:19:54] Lawson but when I use that Jude I tell
[1:19:56] you why I use that because it made such
[1:19:57] an impact on me this is why amen because
[1:20:00] no matter how low you go you're still a
[1:20:04] Son of God don't you ever forget that
[1:20:06] young people there was something
[1:20:08] deposited in you before the fall before
[1:20:11] you went down and that's why you can
[1:20:13] rise back up on your two feet and say
[1:20:15] the Lord give us and the lord taketh
[1:20:17] away but blessed be the name of are you
[1:20:19] hearing me you are elected to be an
[1:20:22] overcomer can I say this you've got a
[1:20:24] position I I'm not going to read it to
[1:20:26] you I'm going to preach it to you you
[1:20:27] got a position in this adoption your
[1:20:30] election amen goes with your
[1:20:32] predestination which goes with your
[1:20:33] adoption which brings you into your
[1:20:35] position and the last thing the devil
[1:20:38] don't want you to do is recognize who
[1:20:40] you are and recognize the position you
[1:20:43] hold and recognize the entitlements that
[1:20:45] God has bestowed upon your life as a son
[1:20:48] or daughter of God you know what the
[1:20:50] devil wants to do he wants to keep you
[1:20:52] living in limbo he wants to keep scaring
[1:20:55] you he wants to keep he wants to keep
[1:20:57] bluffing you but sometime or another you
[1:21:00] got to get the Seal of the Holy Ghost be
[1:21:03] on your flesh be on your spirit on your
[1:21:06] soul and when the Devil comes on Monday
[1:21:09] when the Devil comes on Tuesday because
[1:21:11] he's always a skeptic of the sons of God
[1:21:14] but when that Devil Comes you will
[1:21:16] always overcome can I say this to you I
[1:21:20] think it's time to get some confidence
[1:21:22] of God Amen back in our worship I think
[1:21:24] it's time to get rid of condemnation and
[1:21:27] get rid of guilt and get rid of things
[1:21:29] and baggage you've been carryed I think
[1:21:31] it's high time young people Amen to step
[1:21:34] from instability into the stability of
[1:21:36] the message amen make sure you're
[1:21:38] anchored to something amen that goes
[1:21:41] beyond the feelings of the church goes
[1:21:43] beyond the emotions of the crowd make
[1:21:45] sure you're anchored to the anchor and
[1:21:47] make sure the anchor is anchored can I
[1:21:50] say this to you make sure you're
[1:21:52] harnessed to an absolute message come on
[1:21:55] come on I'm going to preach to you now
[1:21:57] cuz there's going to be times that me
[1:21:58] and brother Ron and brother Danny ain't
[1:22:00] going to be around you but you're still
[1:22:02] an overcomer because you don't need me

[1:22:09] of the hour delivered to you it is a
[1:22:12] constant message listen can I say this

[1:22:17] your good days it's there on your bad
[1:22:19] days when you need a little shot in the
[1:22:21] arm you don't need some preacher to say
[1:22:23] something over you or speak a word over
[1:22:25] you or see a vision over you you need
[1:22:27] the message of the hour to rise up in
[1:22:30] power and absolute Authority and whip
[1:22:32] that devil down beef that devil down
[1:22:35] handcuff that devil and say devil God
[1:22:37] give me this
[1:22:39] position now do you realize if you don't
[1:22:42] know who you are you can't enjoy
[1:22:44] something do you know if you're not sure
[1:22:46] you can stay there you can't enjoy
[1:22:48] something but if you ever get a
[1:22:50] revelation I have a right to be here

[1:22:56] few years ago we we went to a to a to a

[1:23:04] got there they were all sold out well I
[1:23:06] knew somebody at the door and I just
[1:23:07] asked him I said hey I said is there any
[1:23:09] way you could get us in they said well
[1:23:11] sure I said how they said well we got
[1:23:13] passes I said okay you got passes he
[1:23:15] said yeah he said now listen here's the
[1:23:17] pass he said it's not a ticket he said
[1:23:19] there's a difference between a pass and
[1:23:21] a ticket I didn't know this he said this
[1:23:24] pass would allow you to get through the
[1:23:25] door it allow you to get in there but
[1:23:28] when you get in there any seat you see
[1:23:30] open you can take it I said man we don't
[1:23:33] even have to pay we don't have to pay
[1:23:34] nothing he said no it's a pass I said

[1:23:56] has a ticket to that
[1:23:57] seat now you can sit there with a pass
[1:24:01] but if somebody walks up there with a
[1:24:02] ticket and they identify the number on
[1:24:05] the back of the chair with the number on
[1:24:07] the ticket you got to
[1:24:10] go so there was a pass and then there
[1:24:13] was a ticket so we went in there brother
[1:24:15] Miguel and we sat down and man we were
[1:24:18] so nervous because we didn't know at any
[1:24:20] time who was going to show up there was

[1:24:25] mean we went to church and we didn't
[1:24:27] know if we could raise our hands we
[1:24:29] didn't know if we could believe the

[1:24:35] truth about our life we we were we were
[1:24:37] sitting there in fear we were constantly
[1:24:39] looking around amen we weren't hearing
[1:24:41] what the singers were saying we weren't

[1:26:05] liar the devil is a liar you were not
[1:26:08] born of the spirit of error you were
[1:26:11] born of the spirit of truth and you have
[1:26:14] been given a right by the baptism of the
[1:26:17] Holy Ghost to sit down in your position
[1:26:21] as a Son of God as a believer of this
[1:26:24] time word can I say this to you sit down
[1:26:26] in your
[1:26:28] position don't sit there and say well

[1:26:37] praise God as long as I'm good enough

[1:26:41] did we start basing Our Praise on when
[1:26:43] we got good
[1:26:45] enough come on come on Church well I
[1:26:48] praise God if I got good enough can I
[1:26:50] say this to you amen you're not praising
[1:26:52] God Because of Who You Are you're not
[1:26:55] praising God because of how good you are
[1:26:57] how good you've been how good you
[1:26:59] believed you're praising God simply on
[1:27:01] this one fact of who he
[1:27:05] is come on Church you're not praising
[1:27:08] him because of who you are you're
[1:27:10] praising him because of who he is he is
[1:27:13] an overcomer and he has come down on the
[1:27:16] inside of you you are a habitation of
[1:27:19] the spirit of God where Jesus Christ is
[1:27:22] walking in you he's talking in you he is
[1:27:25] overcoming through you what are you
[1:27:28] saying brander I'm saying that we're
[1:27:30] going to have some rough days when we
[1:27:31] leave
[1:27:32] here we're going to have some rough days
[1:27:35] but we are anchored to the pillar of
[1:27:36] fire we are anchored to the message of
[1:27:39] the hour can I say this to you make sure
[1:27:42] that what you're anchored to amen is
[1:27:44] anchored to something make sure what
[1:27:47] you're tied off to is tied off to
[1:27:49] something make sure that when oh God
[1:27:53] make sure when wind begins to blow and
[1:27:55] Mondays begin to come and bad days begin
[1:27:57] to come make sure you don't start
[1:27:59] backing up and saying well devil you
[1:28:01] were right bless your name bless his
[1:28:02] name I don't bless that old devil's name
[1:28:05] amen I take the word of God and I say
[1:28:07] you are a defeated being you are a liar
[1:28:09] get behind me Satan I know what I got at
[1:28:13] Camp come on Church the devil ain't I

[1:28:26] going to come pick on you I'm going to
[1:28:28] go pick on somebody that's got something
[1:28:30] more than I've got I'm going to go find
[1:28:33] somebody that's got $10 or $20 and
[1:28:36] listen let me say this to you the very
[1:28:38] evidence the reason that Devil's picking
[1:28:40] on you and trying to rob from you is
[1:28:43] because you've got more than he's
[1:28:45] got listen he was in heaven and he got
[1:28:49] cast out he was oh God he was created
[1:28:52] there and he was cast out out but you
[1:28:54] were born in sin you were shaping
[1:28:57] iniquity you come in the world speaking
[1:28:59] lies but God by the blood of Jesus
[1:29:01] Christ redeemed your soul back to God
[1:29:03] and performed the ministry of
[1:29:05] reconciliation and now you're going back
[1:29:07] to where the devil can't get back to
[1:29:10] well I feel like shouting on that point
[1:29:12] devil get out of my way I may have bad
[1:29:15] days I may have up days I may have down
[1:29:17] days but I'm going where you can't go

[1:30:15] spiritual
[1:30:17] form we are led by something that does
[1:30:20] not
[1:30:22] change
[1:30:24] now that right there is a very powerful
[1:30:28] picture and the devil hates that
[1:30:31] picture if he could destroy it he would
[1:30:33] have done done it proper not proper
[1:30:35] English forgive me if he could get rid
[1:30:37] of that he would have already got rid of
[1:30:39] it but you know why he can't get rid of
[1:30:42] that is because he can't get rid of
[1:30:48] you you came from the logos of God you
[1:30:53] came out of the pillar of oh God come on

[1:31:10] thinking ain't gone no higher as high as
[1:31:13] your thinking is gone is the fact
[1:31:14] there's a man in that picture but there
[1:31:16] is a God above that man come on church
[1:31:19] can I say this to you there is a God
[1:31:22] above that man can I say this to you and

[1:31:44] head it's underneath my mouth this
[1:31:48] microphone is communicating what I'm
[1:31:51] thinking it is speaking what I'm
[1:31:54] thinking Church of the Living God
[1:31:56] William Mary and brandom amen was the
[1:31:58] seventh angel he was not our God he is
[1:32:01] our Prophet but I'll say this he was the
[1:32:04] microphone of this generation and what
[1:32:07] he said ought to be held from every
[1:32:09] propit it ought to be said by every
[1:32:11] preacher it ought to be believed by
[1:32:13] every believer and you know what I do I
[1:32:15] rebuke that ungodly unbelieving devil
[1:32:18] that will try to squash amen the words
[1:32:20] of authority over this generation Satan
[1:32:24] are an offense to
[1:32:25] me what he said is what God was thinking
[1:32:29] I don't have time to read the close to
[1:32:30] you I'm going to say this he I'm going
[1:32:32] to say this brother said a prophet can't
[1:32:34] even speak his own thoughts so whatever
[1:32:36] he said was not what he was thinking and
[1:32:39] you know what he said he said you are
[1:32:41] the sinless Spotless bride of Jesus
[1:32:43] Christ he said you are an invincible
[1:32:45] Army can I tell you where that come from
[1:32:47] that didn't come from William brandom
[1:32:49] that didn't come from Jeffersonville

[1:32:55] words in your heart I am an elected

[1:33:00] the same PF fire that led Moses and led
[1:33:04] Paul has returned in this
[1:33:07] generation can I say this and anything
[1:33:10] that says anything different than what a
[1:33:12] prophet of God said you ought to throw
[1:33:14] it in the trash you ought to throw it
[1:33:16] back in the hell it come out of stand
[1:33:18] with the word of God stand with the
[1:33:21] message of the hour stand with the power
[1:33:24] of God that released you from the fear
[1:33:26] and scare I didn't know who I was but
[1:33:29] the pillar of fire did I didn't know
[1:33:31] where I come from but the pillar of fire
[1:33:33] did I didn't know where I was going but
[1:33:35] the pillar of fire did and God so loved
[1:33:37] me that he sent a microphone to pick up
[1:33:40] the faults of the pillar of fire and
[1:33:42] here's what the prophet of God said
[1:33:44] people who follow the pillar of fire
