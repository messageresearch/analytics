turning there just want to give a special happy birthday to sister maryland back in the back amen and then we want to also give happy birthday to brother jude so we got we got we got them in all ages tonight we got them just hitting teenage years and we got them hitting i don't know what you want to call it sister maryland but we're thankful that you're still with us and we'll sure appreciate your testimony through the years and what a mighty god we serve we look here and i want to speak to you once again on god does impossible math this is part 16 and i spoke sunday on nothing will stand before your prayer and tonight i want to speak to you on not even cancer so we know if you're familiar with the message you're familiar with this quote or the quotes that brother branham uses when the angel lord met him but we want to finish it through the night and and i would if we would dedicate a sermon to anybody i wouldn't say it would be to any one person but i would say to be those who are in the battle of cancer not only spiritual cancer but also physical cancer but we believe nothing will stand before the believer's prayer not even cancer okay so that's what we're going to focus on tonight and we find here says these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god that you may know that you have eternal life and that you may believe on the name of the son of god and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us so god's ears are not deaf that he doesn't hear but he understands he hears the faintest hearts cry your faint whisper to god he's mindful of it he hears it he says if and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him and we look here in john 15 and verse 7 as well john 15 and verse 7 if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it shall be done unto you these are promises to the believer let me put it like that these are your promises don't just put it off on a believer because sometimes we want to tag that somebody else maybe that super spiritual person in the church but this is your promise as a son and daughter of god he says whatsoever you ask you ask anything and it'll be done unto you herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples as a father hath loved me so how have i loved you continue in my love if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full god bless you this evening we'll let you have your seats tonight go ahead and get our timer started just a wonderful wonderful day today just been in the presence of the lord and just thankful again for the opportunity that god has made for us to be able to stand behind this pulpit and to be able to go off on the field full of time it's just a tremendous blessing my everybody keeps looking at him and says man you're a brand new man you know when all that pressure is off of you to make you a brand new person you know the bible says to to enjoy the liberty wherewith he has made us free so we thank we thank the lord for that but in the message where i think pentecost failed we're going to kind of pick back up where we ended on sunday he said he wants us to ask and believe that our joys would be full he wants you to ask abundantly okay ask for big things a lot of times we come to god and we bring the little things but he says ask for big things don't limit your faith to some little mustard seed get on out here in some kind of faith and move out into big things can we move out into big things tonight now we're speaking on not even cancer oh i will assume that's a pretty big thing so i want to make sure that we're all in this together that's why we spoke sunday and we built it on faith because it takes faith to believe and if you have belief and you have faith in the word of god then nothing will stand before your prayer and the prophet says move on out to big things big things is just as easy to receive as little things he goes you just have to believe see that's the key is you just got to believe whatever your need is tonight you just got to believe no matter how big how small you just got to believe he said that's all he says and you got faith now we discussed that on sunday every man he has got a deal from a measure of faith so there's not one of us here tonight that lacks faith he says we got faith just know exactly how to use it and it'll be all right he goes you can put it right to work and it'll be just fine so we all have faith but we just got to know how to use the faith that's been entrusted to us and i believe tonight how do we do that by hearing the word of god by allowing ourselves to come into his presence and faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god now in the message of inspiration brother man tells us god wants us to ask for big things he didn't just say it once he said it multiple times he don't run out of blessings up there oh my the god that we serve doesn't run out of blood he goes you can't ask god for too much see could you imagine a little fish about this long swimming out in the ocean say i better drink of this water sparingly it may dry up you know some of us that's how we do our faith well we better not ask god this because god can only do so much but we find that god can do amazing things he's the inexhaustible fountain of life he said it would be more reasonable for that little fish or that ocean to drop on that little fish than it would to be to think that we can exhaust to god's blessings there's nothing that we can ask but what god can't provide because he's the inexhaustible fountain of life and he says all heaven belongs to you in ephesians 3 and verse 20 it says now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think according to the power that worketh within us so the word exceeding abundantly or that phrase means more than necessary god can do more than what is necessary for your trial god can do more than what is necessary for your need it also means supremely it means much more than all it means superior extraordinary or extraordinary surpassing uncommon more imminent more remarkable more excellent so we find today church that god is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can even fathom in our finite human minds and the thing that we need to do tonight on a wednesday night is to let our faith loot to believe god let your faith lose tonight to believe that he'll still heal the sick to believe that still that he'll deliver those who are bound notice nothing will stop god's promise there's not one thing not one trial that you go through that can ever stop what god had promised god put it in his word you ask anything in my name that's a promise to the believer and there ain't enough devils in hell can stop that believer from reaching that promise because the devil can't stop what god has already promised and i'm here to tell you tonight god is here we witness god move and god is here to move for you tonight nothing can stand before your prayer your prayer not even cancer see god can do more than is necessary he can do much more than all he can do extraordinary more imminent more remarkable more excellent than you as a believer can even ponder in your mind now some of you are intellectual giants some of you are simple people but no matter where you are in your intellectual bandwidth god can do more than you can even fathom because he's god he's infinite and i love this because you know the thing is you can't put limits on god so we find god can do these things the question is will you let him do it so we know that god can god promise that he can god promise that he will the question is will you let him do it and all that depends on your faith are you willing to let your faith lose tonight to trust god that he said i'll do what you asked of me you got prodigals out there you call them on the scene i'll do what you ask of me but you got to ask it in faith now he tells us in the message faith is the substance this is 1947 and this is where we're going to bring and it's our capstone quote tonight he says now there was an angel came to me in a room and told me that way back back before i was born was before ordained to have a gift of divine healing he came and he told me in a room one night that god had sent the gift and it was a gift of divine healing for the people notice who it was for it wasn't for brother branham it's your gift god sent the gift for you tonight okay and he says and if i could get the people to believe me believe me and would be sincere when i prayed nothing would stand before the prayer he didn't say my prayer it only pertains to brother branham but nothing will stand before thee prayer he says therefore speaking face to face with the supernatural being i believe with all my heart and if i can get you to believe me with all your heart he said that's what moves god and then you're healed see your faith has saved you see what i mean your faith to believe has saved you not what you worked up to and thought in your mind but what you really know the evidence of things not seen see this quote to me is not about physical healing i believe we can apply this to anything any situation that we face as a believer if we can believe nothing will stand before our prayer whatever you ask if you can believe and have faith god will bring it to pass and notice he says your belief in what god said pulls god or moves god toward you so we find that your faith pulls god to your need it pulls god to intercede on your behalf your faith to believe and trust that he will do what he said he'd do that's what moves god to respond to your situation and every person here your situation is unique and different from somebody else but god is yet the same he still moves he still operates he still moves according to his word and all he wants you to do tonight is believe and that's why we took sunday and we built a foundation on faith so you know that you're a believer and god has promised you in the word and nothing can move you off of it so why not believe tonight not only that god can but god will and we find though that is a believer we face hard times now i know this is probably very foreign to some of you you never had a bad day right okay this let's have class participation tonight psalms 34 and verse 17 says the righteous cry in the lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their troubles oh man come on amen let's say that again the righteous cry and the lord heareth and delivered them out of all their troubles they should be a resounding amen otherwise there's no trouble that can take you down god will deliver you out of all your troubles out of all your afflictions out of all your trials on all your calamities the righteous cries they cry out to god they make their petition known and god hears your petition and not only does he hears but he delivers you out of all of them the lord is now unto them that are broken heart and save us such that are of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth him out of them all he's reiterating god's here to tell you tonight i see your affliction but i'm also the liver so many are the afflictions and if you look that word affliction up it means bad it means evil it means unpleasant it means giving up excuse me given a pain on happiness misery but it also means malignant and the word malignant is malignant see in that word if you look it up it means tending to produce death so many are the afflictions the malignancies and when we when we hear the word malignancy or malignant we think cancer we think the threat to human life we think death because we put it all together you hear somebody they get a bad doctor's report they got cancer first thing you think of is death you don't think oh well how precious is that god's gonna deliver no that's not the first thought that you have you think immediately i'm gonna die but brother baby says now when you get the holy ghost you attend to a lot of obstacles how many can testify that well i use well we'll just we'll back that off many are the afflictions of the righteous but god delivereth him out of them all god brings you right up facing with it so he can show you his power and his goodness so we as a believer we have a promise we're not promised promising flowers at ease that's not why we're here tonight we're promised afflictions oh praise god everybody sign up no but we're also promised you may face those afflictions god will bring you to it but god also take you through it god will deliver you from him he'll not let one thing destroy you so you must believe them no matter what the afflictions you're facing whether it be a physical affliction a mental affliction a financial affliction a spiritual affliction god will deliver you you will not be overcome by the affliction you will not be overcome by the malignancy you will not be overcome by the pain of the situation you will not be overcome by the unhappiness you will not be overcome by the misery of the trial you will not be overcome but god will deliver nothing will stand before your prayer not even malignancy not even cancer so let's look at this for a minute let's find out what is cancer i'm breaking back into my teaching gift yeah i got a lot of text messages about that by the way here in god provide a way of healing a cancer in the natural rims would be a scavenger a buzzard eat dead things a cancer comes from a bruise notice a bruised cell now as i bring this out i want y'all to parallel this i want you to think scriptural or not scripture but i want you to think spiritual and natural a lot of times we want to put it all on the natural we fail to look at the spiritual aspect and the spiritual application of it you can get a cancer in your spirit okay you can get a cancer in your spirit sitting right here at even like tabernacle you can get a cancer in your spirit but not even cancer i don't care what form he comes in whether it be natural whether it be spiritual not even cancer will stand before the believer's prayer notice now see a bruised cell usually is where it comes from the cell is bruised all mashed up the cell is backslidden if something happens in there that fails to get the function of the blood to the right to it right he says and through there satan the author of death which god is the author of life satan the author of death puts a demon in there called a devil a demon called cancer cancer is not its name medical science just give it that name the word cancer comes from the word crab and then it means with legs and things it runs out and it's like other diseases they've given their medical terms then this little cancer comes in there first it is a spirit then it gets into a backslidden cell or a bruised cell or a cell that's not operating right now notice listen what brother bam says here he goes oh i like to preach the gospel now for five minutes he goes that's what happens in the church notice he brings the natural then he also flips real quick to the spiritual aspect of it that's what happens in the church when he gets someone failing to operate with the church someone failing and pulling off and getting indifferent that's a cancer in the church it's a devil in that person that's right and it causes the whole church to be sick the best thing to do is have a spiritual operation then he jumps right back but in this this little cell backslid the cancer come in no it's the cancer it lays there first it's in a spirit then it begins to form a tiny little cell of its own and the little cell becomes first couldn't call he goes i can't call the big word of it but first is it form of life it's cancer it's painless notice it's a little cell then it begins to form a little life of its own and he said in the first phase it's painless he said no one even knows what's happening you don't even know that you have it see the same thing flows in the spiritual aspect take somebody who's got a wounded spirit doesn't know but a little spirit a demon will attach to that and a little crab will begin to draw out and begin to pull back and then begin to get a complex and begin to get this and they begin but see the person doesn't even know it they don't want it it's just there because of a bruised spirit or a bruised cell and that's what brother brad i'm saying it's painless he says no one knows it's happening and now this little cell is born it must feed notice in order to feed it has to feed on your bloodstream just like you feed on the bloodstream when you was in your mother's womb you fed on the substance that she ate and so forth so does this cancer feed on the substance of your body it's one little cell then it grows and it gets begins to feed and another cell breaks out and another cell breaks out and another cell breaks out and after a while is sell on sale sell on cell tumor cataract whatever it may be it grows bigger bigger bigger larger spreading out the more cells and more cells here goes the first thing you know it begins to zap or sap so much blood till this young lady begins to feel sick so notice it's been there for a while and it's beginning to build up and get into spread but as it begins to spread then it begins to draw the blood and begins to pull the life out of the host and it begins to make them feel sick he says what is it it's also poison it's death it runs into every little fiber of the body that it can down into the tissue stretching its legs down weeding out like roots of a tree going all around wrapping through the intestines up through the spine he said the doctor comes along opens them up there's nothing can be done the man to the best of his knowledge is saying everything that he knows there it is so the patient up it's finished it's all there's nothing can be done you can't take that person all apart we couldn't find it anyway anyhow if we could there it is the patient's hopelessly helplessly gone then as far as a doctor is concerned so this is the stage in the progression of cancer and the patient is hopeless the patient is helpless because you can't take the patient and continue to open them up and dissect and eradicate every sale it takes something greater than a physician now i'm being told and i tried to find this out today but i'm just gonna i've been told that when brother biscuit brother bisco met with brother branham and brother branham begin to tell him about the story of how the angel visited him what we just spoke about when the angel visited him and gave him the commission of divine healing he said you'll take this gift of divine healing to the people and if you can get the people to believe you then nothing will stand before your prayer and brother branham asked the angel what about cancer and his reply was not even cancer so i don't believe that god sent an angel on a personal mission to tell brother branham that nothing will stand before his prayer not even cancer and then when he left the scene all of us were a null and void but i believe the same commission the same promise the same visitation that that angel visited with a prophet came to him and assured him that nothing will stand before his prayer it's the same angel that we've been witnessing here at even like tabernacle coming to you and i too many of us here tonight and he's witnessed again that nothing will stand before the prayer of the bride no matter how dark it is no matter what the afflictions you're facing no matter what we're going through nothing will stand before the believer's prayer not even cancer notice now i believe also that this angel began to tell brother ben exactly how to get your need met first was to get to people to believe see that's the key because if we can't get you to rise up in faith there's nothing that god can do for you god can't do anything but what you first confess that he's done it so that takes faith right but he also says now he puts it back on the ministry or on the prophet on the ministry he says you must be sincere when you pray so otherwise you've got to have feeling for the people you've got to have empathy for the people put yourself in their place and then when you begin to pray nothing will stand before your prayer because one they believe two you begin to intercede you put yourself there as if you're facing the same affliction and no doubt you want to be healed no doubt you want to be delivered no doubt you want to be set free and we find when that takes place when the believer believes and a man begins to pray and he prays with sincerity god begins to move and there's nothing we'll stand before the prayer now we find here in first corinthians 5 and verse 7. first corinthians 5 and verse 7. the bible says purge out therefore the old leaven that we may be or that ye may be a new lump you got to watch how you say that word lump right you can offend somebody today with that some of you got that joke some of you didn't that's okay he says now as you are 11. he's let me go back and read it again purge out therefore the old 11 that you may be a new lump as you are unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feasts not with old leaven neither with leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth this scripture is going to play a part later on during this service so just hang tight with it so this word purge here means to cleanse out thoroughly cleanse or clean thoroughly otherwise we can't have any of our man-made ideas okay we got to thoroughly cleanse out so to keep the feast we are to keep the feasts we are to do it but we're not to do it with the old 11 man's ideas man traditions we want to be a new love we want to be unleavened in the way that we continue to keep our worship pure and to keep our services pure and and have the spirit and the truth is not to allow malice to come in not to allow wickedness to come in not to allow ourselves to be entangled without the affairs of the world and not to allow man's ideas to persuade us this way or that way and we find you know paul tells them now he goes keep the feasts but do it not with the old leaven but neither with the leaven of mouth so he begins to identify what's going on in that church there's malice in that church there's wickedness in that church but i want you to come back to the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth and paul is trying to urge the believer come back to sincerity believe what i'm preaching to you believe what i told you i met god i met him on the road he changed my life he opened my eyes and i could see who i am and that's what he's trying to say to you tonight is come back to the bread of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth not just one and not have the other but we got to have both but first we got to eradicate malice and that word malice means malignancy cancer the word malistaire means malignancy cancer ill will desire to injure depravity evil trouble but the word sincere means we got to be free from pretense or deceit we got to be free and we got to have genuine feelings we want to be sincere in our worship i don't want to just come to worship because that's what's expected of us no we come to worship because we're believers and we're free from all these things that's trying to pull us down satan trying to get in there the bible will tell us in hebrews 12 and verse 1 let us lay aside every weight otherwise let us lay aside every burden every encompass lay it all aside that we may do what that we may run the race that is set before us each of you here tonight have a race to run but don't run it with malice don't run it with wickedness don't run up with encompasses of this life don't run it with ill will towards somebody else no run this race with sincerity of the word hey god hand picked you in this hour not everybody here is hearing this message i'm not just speaking about this message tonight but not everybody has been able to grasp and understand the message of malachi 4. revelations 10 7 and 8. luke 17 30. these things are special only a unique class of people can receive it now we find in exodus 12 and verse 3 and the 10th day of the month they shall take them every man a lamb according to the house or their father is a lamb for a house then we drop down in verse six and they're going to kill this lamb in the evening verse seven take the blood strike it on the two side posts in the upper door post of the house we spoke about that on sunday how we applied the blood blood being the word we apply it with hyssop he was representing faith that's what we're to do but also we find here that in verse 8 and they shall eat the flesh in that night roasted with fire and unleavened bread this unleavened bread is sincerity and truth the word not mixed with man's ideas notice israel killed the lamb applied the blood with hyssop and they also took of the unleavened bread this was emblematic of purity so let us be sincere and true in our worship when we walk through these doors we come to worship god we don't come just to see somebody or to be seen but we come to worship god for what he has done for us let us be sincere let us be true let us be faithful and i believe that no christian can have or give evidence of sincerity who is not willing to put away all sin and sin is unbelief no christian can have malice and ill will in his heart and claim to be a true worshiper of god no christian can have want somebody to get a recompense of their of their injury oh they harmed me so i'm gonna i want them god to get even with them we can't have that we're to let those things go you know but we are to purge out that old leaven if we plan on seeing god moving in our midst and it's going to we got to remain pure in our worship we we're going to see god in our midst and we're going to see miracles we're going to see healings we want to see the things that take place then we can't come within the encumbrances to our worship we can't mix in our own unbelief and expect to receive from god we can't mix our own ideas and expect to receive we can't mix psychology in with it and expect to receive from god we can't mix man's ideas programs and expect to receive we must face what we're facing with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth we have the truth this message is the truth god's word is true and every man is alive so no matter what it looks like no matter what we're facing we are to purge out the old leaven and keep the feast the worship our worship with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth now we find as we begin to jump a little bit here i'm going to go to romans 4 and verse 16. it says therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all seed not to that only which is of the law but also that which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him who he believed even god who quickened the dead and calleth those things which were not as though they were notice who against hope believed in hope verse 19 and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead neither yet the dennis of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promises of god through unbelief but he was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded what he had promised he was also able to perform so abraham had to believe for the impossible now i know many you may be getting tired of my series on god does impossible math but it's real to me because i was thinking about it pondering about it earlier today that word math is we think about an equation god always has the answer to the equations you and i can write the equation out like right here and it may take us hours to kind of to arrive at the answer and sometimes god allows certain things to take place because he knows he's going to get to the answer but things got to line up and i believe just like we faced with abraham abraham was holding on for 25 years he was given a promise and the bible says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god abraham wasn't relying just on the physical substance that he took in the land abraham was living off the promise that god gave him abraham i'm going to visit you abraham you're going to have a son by sarah and you're going to call his name isaac and months went by 9 months nothing year went by nothing 5 10 15 20 25 years but finally abraham the bible says he staggered not at the promises of god he believed in hope he stood firm on the foundation of the word he wasn't just believing for his own physical substance he was believing for the spiritual that god gave the promise and no matter what our faith god will enter my word god will honor his faith god will honor if i just keep believing god will bring it to pass and we saw abraham a man who was tired in his body and he ignored the deadness of his life he ignored the deadness of sarah's womb and he believed and gives hope he believed when everybody else said abraham you're acting a fool why are you believing this because god said it and nothing will stand before my prayer i believe god i believe his word i believe his commission to me and he stood there and god made it manifest abraham was living not just on substance alone but on the promise of the word of god and church that's what we've got to live on we've got to live on this world we gotta live on thus saith the lord each of us today we can choose right here tonight to either accept the word or reject the word see abraham had to believe here he was an old man 25 years old his life dead no strength but god tells him i'm going to nurse you back to health think about this abraham's old age didn't stand in the way of the promise his deadness of his body didn't stand the way of the promise sarah's womb didn't stand in the way of the promise god gave him a promise i'm going to nurse you come here abraham and nurse from el shaddai the breast of god all that you have need of abraham i'm here you don't have to live just on physical substance alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god and brother man will tell us he says now no matter what it looks like we don't look at what we see we look at what we don't see is that right see the word means to look there doesn't mean it means to understand so you have to accept it by faith and then when it comes into you you understand it you accept healing the same way stay right with it not what you look at but it's what you believe what you understand to be the truth what you're looking at the unseen then stay with it god's formed abraham's body god formed sarah's body god allowed them to get old wrinkled dried up milk veins gone everything gone only to provide or to perform a supernatural event in their life foreshadowing what he was going to do in our lives but like abraham we got we got to judge god faithful like sarah like abraham stagger not at the promise of god not being weak in faith but believe being fully persuaded that nothing will stand before the believer's prayer surely god if he could do this for abraham and abraham believed and abraham his body be turned back and he manifest a promised son surely the same god that did that for abraham would also for us destroy any enemy that's trying to destroy your life the bible says in second thessalonians 1 6 seeing it is a righteous thing with god to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you god's going to get even with your enemy some of you need to write that down god's going to get even with my enemy nothing will stand before my prayer notice now he says that sickness whatever you have if that is pulling on you it's going to try try to put everything in your mind to keep you from believing that this is the truth he says this which is coming now and me speaking to you is trying to get you to believe that it is the truth you see now here's the warfare see if you will believe it he says the holy spirit will pronounce the blessing satan has to leave it has to be so you see every service there's a spiritual warfare satan is trying to get you not to believe and yet god is trying to get you to believe by what by preaching the gospel by preaching faith by preaching the word and so we find he does these things and he does supernatural things within the body of the local body and even the church itself for the main purpose to get the people to believe why don't we see the healing of sister atlanta and different ones in our church is to get you to believe and trust god for no matter what you're facing don't make any difference whether you have a prayer card or not say we don't pass out prayer cards how many you ever been healed in this service in the church come on raise your hand you've been healed how many you've been delivered i mean you've been set free what is that did you have a prayer card no but god honored your faith and that's the way god moves god's not looking for he says many more are healed out there than ever that comes up here it's because of the faith they begin to believe and up here he begins to manifest this one and that one tell them what their issue is and see the sign and see this and and go back and discern the heart and everything but it was for a purpose was to get you out there to believe that god was on the platform and i'm going to tell you tonight god is on the platform he shows up for every service we don't just say that as cliche where two or three will be gathered in my name i'll be there god is there every service he's there but yet every service the devil's there and try to pull you back and try to give you unbelief and there's a spiritual warfare but you've got to yield yourself to faith and believe and respond to the word don't sit there like a bump on the lawn and expect god to do something when you're not putting nothing out put something out in the service believe god take god and his word say amen to the word yes lord now he says now if we are if you can get the people to believe you not believe notice now not believe me as a man but believe the message i'm telling you there it is see get the people the angel tell me if you can get the people to believe you not believe me as a man but believe the message i'm telling you so he says now watch the order of it this is in led by the spirit 1950 he says listen at the order of it ministers especially now here it is now listen close if you get the people to believe you he said and be sincere when you pray nothing will stand before your prayer see that's why we preach faith that's why we preach a living god that's why we preach a god that still heals that's why we preach about a god that still does miraculous is to elevate your faith we preach jesus christ both mechanics and dynamics but you've got to believe see the order of it is first is for the believer to believe and then us as a ministry to be sincere when we pray so we find now our thought tonight is not even cancer you're probably wondering bro joe you're going all around debbie's house i know there's not a debbie here oh maybe there is well you didn't used to be here anyway we're going around debbie's house kind of nice house by the way with a beautiful view on the back porch but we want to look at tonight and we're going to hone down not even cancer so cancer was one of the greatest threats to life in the 1940s 30s earlier beyond medical science didn't have the means or the capabilities at that time to treat a cancer patient it wasn't until the mid-1940s that science began to try to treat cancer patients and they treated them with penicillin and sulfur so when someone was diagnosed with cancer they were they were a dead man walking they knew it was a death sentence they were going to die it was just a matter of time and that's why the prophet of god will ask the angel what about cancer but see because cancer was the greatest threat to life the greatest hindrance was cancer but we find here in mark 9 and verse 23 jesus said unto him if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth all things uh matthew 21 and 21 jesus answered said unto them verily i say unto you if you have faith and not doubt you shall not only do this which is done in the fig tree but also if you shall say unto this mountain to be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever you ask in prayer believing you shall receive see god doesn't put limits on what you're able to ask doesn't put limits there he says all things all things are possible to them that believe therefore the only thing that limits god is you you are the limiter to what your need is but if you can let your faith loose tonight there's no limits to what god can do for you tonight the bible says in hebrews 11 verse 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him that's why it's paramount that we have faith that's why it's paramount that we preach faith it's one thing to preach the deep mysteries of the word but we also got to mix that or mix it or to intermingle that with with this very simple faith-based preaching because we're all on different levels we have some bays we have some older we have some in the middle i like the deep things of god i like the faith of god i like it all but we it takes all of it that's why i believe we've got a world a well-rounded ministry here because you get all the angles and we're all our focus is to get you to believe that god will do the impossible there's nothing that god can't do if you'll release your faith to him and let him to do it tonight he says now there was an angel sent from the presence of god he said if you can get the people to believe you would be sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer not even cancer and they asked brother branham does everybody get well brother branham he said everybody that truly believes gets wells thousands have been healed now when they lifted that brazen uh serpent in in the wilderness there not everybody got healed but those that looked on it those that believed that when they looked at it because they were bit by a serpent they were healed but those that refused said oh that's just hogwash they died and we find at the pool of bethesda those that had faith to get so close to the water because they knew when the angel came down and he troubled the water if they could get in they'd be made well so it's not for everybody but it's for whosoever will believe all things are possible tonight if it means lifting up on a brazen serpent the brazen serpent never prayed for anybody the pool of bethesda never prayed for anybody but god sent down ministry today sincere ministers that are preaching the anointed word to do what to get you to believe so that you can't have your prayer met so that god can minister to your need and you can go away victorious see man is god's agent today god gives gifts to man now of course god operates by the holy spirit through man man is god's agent not a tape player man is god's agent man god anointed man to preach the gospel to elevate the faith to get the people to believe so nothing would be impossible with you and your prayer he said the thing of it is now the thing is is to get the people to believe that this is the truth you got to get the people to believe my responsibility for the heirs responsibility the responsibility of this ministry and every god ordained ministry is to get the people to believe that's our responsibility your responsibility is to believe and then we do that by preaching the word of god now listen what brother brown says here in the angel in the commission this is 1950. he goes i'm going to pray for you you believe i believe with all my heart and lay hands over on them and pray for them and ask the blessing in the name of the lord jesus passed him on he goes now they're supposed to go away rejoicing believing that they're going to get well the cripple's supposed to believe that they're going to walk the blind is supposed to believe that they're going to see so he was telling you you have a responsibility sometimes we get in a prayer line and we want our hearts to serve but that wasn't the commission the commission was if you can believe he could just pass you on through and you as to go through believing that if you had blind eyes you can be able to walk out and see if you were crippled you're going to walk out there on the other side that's your responsibility our responsibility is to preach the word with sincerity and when we pray for you to enter in and to believe that god is going to do what god said he will do and we will see the needs of the people met and you saw time after time after time god god came by and god done so much for brother branham and brother branagh's ministry but it wasn't just for brother branham it's for those that are standing for this message those that are standing for this gospel god is the same god he didn't cease to be god when brother branham went off the scene he's as much god for you tonight we got evidence in the land church that god is a healer and god is a miracle worker that god is a savior that god can bring the prodigals home we have seen it we have witnessed it hey god is still moving and nothing will stand before your prayer not even the greatest threat to life cancer can't stand before you [Applause] notice now brother says now regardless of what they have regardless of what they have he designated see god who is my judge knows he designated cancer he said nothing if you can get to people to believe you and be sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer not even cancer if you get the people to believe you not believe you as a man that's what we feel many of us we put our faith in a man and it's not man that we put our faith in but it's in the word of god believe that the message that he's teaching or the message that he's preaching the message that is coming for believe that it is the truth and then he said he designated cancer see he designated cancer my my my time is flying by i gotta speed up here now let's just see how fast cancer has to leave in the presence of god how many would like to see that just for a minute okay good problem says now let me get there he said you can get the people to believe and be sincere when you pray nothing will stand before your prayer there'll be nothing no matter what disease you have it won't stand before the prayer if you will believe he says they got to believe they got to testify they got to confess it and god will bring it to pass so we find here let me find out where i was where i wanted to go here how fast this is in 1951 the second miracle he said bring the lady all right sister what do you think about it you believe put your put your handkerchief in your other hand and lay your hand on mine what does that look like to you strange looking sight there isn't it it's cancer come here just for a moment you know when the angel lord met me that was the first thing he said to not even cancer will stand before the prayer do you believe it he goes i want you to repeat this and watch my hand repeat this as i say from from your heart he says lord jesus now i want you to watch he says seeing the moving of the hand lord jesus the lady repeats after brother branham i believe you i accept you as my healer i believe that there was a supernatural being that said these things to brother branham i believe his presence is here now i accept my healing now what happened something changed there didn't it the vibration stopped didn't it your faith has made you whole sister your cancer is dead it's gone god bless you nothing will stand before your prayer brother branham didn't heal her he just elevated her faith see the sign that she saw in his hand wasn't what healed her her faith to believe that that supernatural being that met him in the cave or met him in that little room and gave him the commission that he had and if he could get her to believe because he knew he was going to be sincere when he prayed nothing would stand before that prayer and it was just a matter of minutes and cancer left so in order for this to work we got to believe the ministry has to be sincere we can't mix it with our own ideas but it's got to be the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth so sincerity plays a major major major major role in what we get from god sincerity plays a major role in the binding of the enemy sincerity can we go a little further i'm kind of liking this teaching brother i'm doing good that's from a teacher y'all he's just telling me what i want to hear notice here this is in the paradox and we're going to i'm trying to tie some things together because we find that the unleavened bread is sincerity and truth and and we find that in order for nothing to stand before your prayer you got to believe and we got to be sincere and brother branham here we find him he goes it seemed like everybody was afraid i said what's everybody afraid of and the voice came and said there is such danger in these days this great hideous thing that that is death when it strikes you and i heard the weeds smashing down and i look excuse me and here come a monster snake crawling through the weeds and i thought now knowing that this is a vision then he says then i shall see what this animal is or this beast is and it crawled up on the highway and as soon as i got sidom i knew it was the mamba a mama is an african snake which is the most deadly bite of all there is see there's nothing as poison as a mamba the snake of course represents death so here he is he goes into a vision and he sees this mama the greatest threat the greatest the threat to life in africa is the black mamba and we find that the mama like cancer is the most deadly bite and it's instantaneous debt as soon as it strikes you and he finds now he goes now the snake of course represents sin and we know that there's only one sin and that's the sin of unbelief so that's the thing brother brahma is trying to get us away from is get away from your unbelief because you'll never get anywhere with god if you have unbelief but if you can believe then all things are possible if you can believe see there was an overwhelming fear of the mama and today there's an overwhelming fear of cancer and if you've been bitten by the chance of recovery of zero he says now then it comes to mama he's death he's so fast you can't see him he goes over the top of the weeds and propels himself with the back of his tail and just and he's gone and he's gone he hits you in the face usually stands up high and strikes hard and when he hits you you just got a few breaths to your finish it don't only paralyze it gets into your bloodstream it gets it gets the nerves everything you just die in just a few seconds he says them native boys track boys you can say mama and they'll butt their heads together and scream because this death just is a few seconds when one hits you notice the parallel to cancer somebody get cancer and that's the first thing they just oh my goodness i'm not going to make it i'm going to die i've got to get my house in order i got to get these things he said he was on the highway and i looked at him and he looked angry at me and he licked his tongue out and here he come but when he got right close he would run up fast and then he would get slower and slower and just quiver and stop then something will hold him off he couldn't bite me he would run turn around on the other side try another approach from this side and he would get back and he would start and he had switched right toward me get slower and slower and sore and then stop and then shake like that and move back he couldn't strike me he goes then he turned and he looked at my friend and the way he went after my friend and i seen my friend just jumping in the air over him and over him and over him trying the best that he could he was striking at him he says i said oh if it ever would hit him it'll be instant death and no wonder everybody is so scared because when the thing hits you it's instant death he said it was just striking at him and i threw my hands and i said oh god have mercy on my brother i said if this serpent ever strikes him it'll kill him i don't know if brother branham saw it but i just can't help but to see the unbelief in this day the unbelief in this day and what is it trying to do he couldn't get the couldn't get the prophet he believed the word he just got up to him and it just slowed down and just came to a halt but it's those in our day now they're running they're trying to jump over some trying to believe and it's bit so many that's turned away and ran so many have died and gone away and we find this thing just come at him and yet he's he and brother battle just cries out he goes and he goes if if this serpent ever strikes him it'll kill him he goes then the serpent turned to me and i said that and i looked and it looked at me again and the voice came from above and said you have been given power to bind him the worst or any and i said god what must i do he said there's one thing that you must do you must be more sincere more sincere the days of play in church are over the days of just going through the motions are over we must be more sincere if we plan on binding the serpent keeping unbelief out of our home keeping unbelief out of our marriages keep unbelief out of our children keep unbelief off the job keep unbelief out of the church keep unbelief we have to be more sincere i said well god give me more sincerity and let me let me have sincerity and i raised up my hands to him again and there was a great something came over me and just lifted me up seemed like that my whole body was just charged with something and i looked at the serpent and then he started towards me and he couldn't do it yet and i said satan in the name of the lord jesus christ i'll bind you and he said then the serpent the blue smoke flew out of him he curled up made that sign like an s a capital s made backwards the and sign notice and which means this one or anything below him because he was the worst blue smoke fell out of him and his tail choked his own self to death around his head and when he made that backwards s that sign and as a conjunction you see choked it to death and the brother was free he says no now i say notice this he didn't bind him in the name of a message believer he didn't bind him in the name of a denomination he didn't bind him in the name of the greatest preacher or his favorite preacher he bound him in the name of the lord jesus christ and when the serpent was bound everything beneath him or below him was bound everything he goes i went over there and i mashed on and i found out i wanted to find out about it because it was a vision and i hit on the thing and it turned like that and it looked like a handle of a glass handle on the pitcher and just made a solid crystal and i think well how quick that blue smoke was life and everything had left all the elements and it turned the glass and then the voice came to me again and said you can also unbind him you can also unbind him so within the believer tonight is the power to bind the serpent and within the believer tonight is also the power to unbind the serpent i said satan that i may know i unbind you and when i did he started coming to life again wiggling and i said i bind you in the name of jesus christ and when it did the smoke flew out of him again and he choked himself right back again and turned the crystal so notice not only do we have the power to bind but we also have the power to unbind how do we unbind the serpent i'm glad you asked jesus said if you ask the father anything in my name i will do it and he asks us not to doubt but when you pray to believe that you receive what you ask and it will be given to you even if you could say unto this mountain be moved and not doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you shall have whatever you said father we know that this is the truth we watch it day by day there is no fault in your word it's because we can't be at that spot sometimes our faith won't move us up there we flustrate and doubt but your doubt is what unbinds the serpent that's why we preach faith that's why he said if you can get the people to believe now notice you bind the serpent then you bound everyone beneath him you bind the serpent you bind every other demon below him because he's the greatest threat and you do that with sincerity now when brother branham faced the mainly the maniac at oregon we all familiar with the story but we're going to tell it because i'm preaching and i got a few more minutes left so that's all great so we find here here he is preaching to an audience of 6 600 million or 600 people he's got a platform full of preachers this maniac just broke some man's jaw broke his shoulder walks out on a platform threatening brother brown's life all the men on the platform leave brother said it was 250 men on the platform every minister ran because they knew this man was a maniac and what he had just done here he says i weigh 128 pounds this man made may weigh 275 to 300 pounds and he said he came out and he began to threaten and he began to threaten and he goes there's 600 600 people sitting there besides what was out in the street everybody was breathless he goes i weighed 128 pounds and he turned around and he said you better know he goes you better brother man said you better know what you're talking about when you when you face that he goes tonight i'll prove that there's nothing to you but you're a hypocrite notice this man was making a challenge he was making a challenge brother never said a word he says tonight because you made this challenge now he was he was thinking about this man and he says in different places here and i want to try to get to where i want to what i really want to hone into tonight but brother brown says you know if you can have sincerity you can have love for the people he said this man didn't know me because this man was probably a father and he probably had a wife and he probably had children back home and he you know he's not against me and he had a love for this maniac and so we find love and hatred was about to be in a battle a warfare and he says now he goes and about then i heard something talking it was myself and it said because that you have challenged the spirit of god tonight you'll fall over my feet see he says in the presence of almighty god no matter what it is he's the lord in the very present help in a time of trouble don't be afraid stand on your ground when god moves god is god now i believe sister jessica and sister lydia witnessed that this past camp meeting when we had a girl who was possessed with the devil and they took her to the back and i was able to i was not able but i went back with her and they called the two sisters to come back there with us and it took everything in our power three human beings to hold her down and to keep her contained she was one supernatural strength and she was arching back and moaning and beginning to foam at the mouth like a a rabie dog i mean it was just an awful sort and after an hour of just working with her and working with her and working with her finally getting her come to herself brother matt came in brother mcgary came in and we found god began to move and god began to deal with her and we got her to a place where she exposed everything that was going on but not only that she had to get to a place of repentance and then another testament i believe brother tim told you guys just the other day the one on sunday morning i go over there and begin to pray for her and that devil i just began to say a little simple prayer you know go back in and just try and i just you know hey this spirit of fear and torment you know it can't stay and as soon as i did the thing because it spoke out i don't like you i don't like you i said well good i don't like you either the feelings are very mutual but i already dealt with this young lady before and i've already dealt with the spirit on her before but this was a little bit different but notice this spirit now was trying to get his bluff in by speaking out of her the other one you couldn't get her to say anything she was just just uncontrollable just arching and everything but yet you got to know like the prophet of god you've got to know where you stand when you face off with those things now if i wouldn't have have the holy ghost that thing would have looked at me and said you're a hypocrite and done whatever it wanted to do with me but it looked at me and says i don't like you you know how confident i felt i said oh buddy well get ready because you're about to come out because i know my position as a son of god and not only that i know my commission that we should cast out devils she wanted to be free she didn't want this thing to harbor inside of her and we began to pray and we cast that thing out and she went back into service and she was completely fine worshipped the lord gave testimony the next week but see because these signs are still following believers and when this enemy made it uh made a boast or made a challenge to brother branham he didn't make a challenge to brother branham that chief of that devil made a challenge to the holy spirit and the holy spirit and brother battle accepted the challenge and it says you'll fall over my feet he says i'll show you whose feet off all over and he went to swing at brother branham and he began to turn around and turn around and he fell over his feet pinned to his feet and the little policeman said is he healed is he delivered he said no he worships that thing because he thinks he's right notice he worships it he couldn't get free because he thinks he's right if he would have ever repented and said i'm wrong he would have been delivered that's why you got to get him to repentance that's why you got to get them to the holy ghost that's why you got to get them free not only to expose what's there but to get them to say i'm sorry god i'm sorry for my actions then they could be free brother says when that man when that maniac when that chief devil when he was defeated the tribe the chief of the tribe of that tribe of demons when he was defeated he says everybody he said the chief man defeated just just begin to raise up out of the wheelchairs out of the cars out of the stretchers everything else to walk see what was it he said the meeting was over everybody was healed and walked out while when satan was defeated the whole audience believed with one accord and went out now satan is defeated in one case he said he's the same today he's defeated in every case and if we can defeat cancer and cancer has been defeated then you can divide the cancer the worst are in it nothing will stand before the believer's prayer not even cancer but it takes sincerity sincerity binds the serpent and when you bind the serpent everything below it is defeated everything you can put your foot on it as a son and daughter of god and tread on serpents [Applause] see and he said the greatest devil and the chief of all devils is unbelief and there's only one sin and there's no other sin but unbelief he said that chief of that tribe of demons made a challenge and lost he said you see and that's when the spirit of god struck the building and everything was healed because the chief the main one was bound but it took sincerity he loved the man but the man the spirit in the man made a challenge to his god and his god accepted the challenge and i'm here to tell you god is here to accept the challenge on your behalf tonight god is here to accept the challenge he says the devil made a chalice and
