[39:04] and for this time for we ask it in the
[39:06] mighty name of our lord and savior jesus
[39:08] christ
[39:09] amen if you have your bibles tonight
[39:11] we're going to look here in the book of
[39:12] nehemiah
[39:18] you love the lord this evening amen it's
[39:22] good to be here nehemiah we're going to
[39:23] look here in verse
[39:24] chapter 4 and verse 7.
[39:27] chapter four and verse seven
[39:31] glad to see that the rain the storm
[39:33] didn't keep you guys away tonight i was
[39:34] concerned about that when i pulled up at
[39:37] five o'clock it was pouring down a
[39:38] monsoon
[39:41] but we're glad we're here so you know
[39:43] what you made the effort to be here
[39:44] right
[39:46] so let's have church let's allow the
[39:48] lord to speak to us we find here in
[39:49] nehemiah 4 and verse 7
[39:51] but it came to pass that sin ballot and
[39:53] tobiah the arabians and the ammonites
[39:55] and the astrodites
[39:56] heard that the walls of jerusalem were
[39:58] made up and that the breaches began to
[40:00] be stopped
[40:01] then they were very roth you know what i
[40:03] believe that
[40:04] the devils of hell realized this past
[40:06] weekend that some breaches got stopped
[40:08] up
[40:09] that somebody ruined the devil's plans
[40:12] over the weekend
[40:13] he had plans for your life he has plans
[40:15] for your future but god has other plans
[40:18] so god came down and destroyed the
[40:20] devil's plans that he had for you
[40:22] we find here and then in verse 8 they
[40:25] all conspired to them together to come
[40:27] in the fight against jerusalem
[40:28] and to hinder it nevertheless we made
[40:31] our prayer unto
[40:32] our god come on church
[40:36] and a set watch against them day and
[40:38] night because of them
[40:39] and judah said the strength of the
[40:41] bearers of burden is decayed
[40:43] and there is much rubbish so that we're
[40:45] not able to build the wall
[40:46] and our our adversaries said they shall
[40:49] not know neither see
[40:50] till we come in the midst among them
[40:52] enslave him and cause the work to cease
[40:54] notice the devil he always tries to slip
[40:57] in
[40:57] unaware unannounced when you least
[41:00] expect it that's why we always have to
[41:02] be on guard
[41:03] we never let our guard down and to
[41:06] recognize the devil in every one of his
[41:08] schemes
[41:10] so we find here that says verse 12 and
[41:13] it came to pass that when the jews which
[41:15] dwelt by them came they said unto us ten
[41:18] times they reiterated the enemy's plans
[41:20] to him ten times
[41:21] they wanted them to know that they know
[41:23] that the devil is against you
[41:26] all right they had done it ten times for
[41:29] all the places which you shall return
[41:31] unto us
[41:31] they will be upon you therefore said i
[41:34] in the lower places behind the wall
[41:36] and on the high places even or i even
[41:39] set the people after their families
[41:41] with their swords their spears and their
[41:43] bows
[41:44] notice you wasn't unarmed but god
[41:46] prepared you
[41:47] he's given you a weapon it's up to you
[41:49] to use that weapon it's up to you to
[41:51] to take that weapon with you and i
[41:53] looked and i rose up and said unto the
[41:55] nobles and to the rulers and to the rest
[41:57] of the people
[41:58] be be not ye afraid of them remember the
[42:02] lord which is great
[42:03] and terrible and fight for your brethren
[42:06] if ever there ever been a time for us to
[42:08] fight for our brethren is now
[42:11] fight for your brethren fight for your
[42:12] sons
[42:14] come on moms and dads fight for your
[42:16] daughters fight for your wives fight for
[42:18] your houses
[42:19] has there ever been a time for us to
[42:21] fight this now
[42:22] so i hope you come tonight to fight hope
[42:25] you come tonight with your sword or
[42:27] whatever you got
[42:28] you come to use it tonight and not to
[42:30] sit idle
[42:33] and it came to pass when our enemies
[42:35] heard that it was known
[42:36] unto us and god had brought their
[42:38] counsel to not
[42:40] that we returned all of us to the wall
[42:43] everyone
[42:44] unto his work and it came to pass
[42:47] from that time forth that the half of my
[42:49] servants wrought in the work
[42:51] and the other half of them held both
[42:53] spears and shields and bows and
[42:55] herbergens or however you say that word
[42:57] i'm sorry
[42:58] and the rulers were behind all the house
[42:59] of judah they which build it on the wall
[43:02] and they would bear burdens
[43:04] with all those that were laden or laded
[43:06] everyone with his hands wrought
[43:08] in the work and with the other hand he
[43:11] held a weapon
[43:12] you can be seated this evening i just
[43:15] want to speak to you once again on god
[43:16] does impossible math
[43:18] this will be part six but i want to give
[43:19] it a subtitle tonight
[43:21] from that time and we find here that
[43:24] nehemiah had a great
[43:26] burden to rebuild the wall so that his
[43:27] people could worship god again and offer
[43:30] sacrifices
[43:31] but it's just as any of us and you try
[43:33] to do god a service the devil is always
[43:35] there
[43:36] to disrupt the plan of god so he comes
[43:39] in and he
[43:40] and he's he you know that we know how
[43:42] the devil does he calls cause disruption
[43:44] but
[43:44] nehemiah went down to the city he
[43:46] surveyed the walls he didn't tell
[43:48] anybody what he was doing
[43:49] and we finally gathered the people again
[43:52] the next day in nehemiah 2 and verse 18
[43:54] and he begins to tell them the
[43:56] revelation that he has
[43:57] or the desire that he has to rebuild the
[44:00] wall so that they can gather together
[44:02] again
[44:02] in the city behind the walls there and
[44:04] begin to worship god and offer god's
[44:07] sacrifice
[44:08] and praise so that their burdens and
[44:09] their sins can be lifted from them
[44:12] and we find here that each of them the
[44:14] bible would tell us
[44:15] they all commanded they all spoke back
[44:18] to nehemiah
[44:19] and they said let us rise up and build
[44:22] so they caught the revelation or they
[44:24] caught the inspiration
[44:26] behind nehemiah's desire and i wonder
[44:28] tonight if we can catch that inspiration
[44:31] behind this prophetic ministry that god
[44:33] has sent down in this hour
[44:35] it's not to build his own kingdom but it
[44:37] was to rebuild the kingdom of god
[44:40] where you can worship god in spirit and
[44:42] in truth with nothing broken no breaches
[44:45] stop
[44:45] we can serve a living god with signs and
[44:48] wonders
[44:49] and the outpouring of the spirit i
[44:51] believe that's what god sent
[44:52] william branham for in this hour was to
[44:55] rebuild the walls
[44:56] of true worship
[44:59] but we find just like in that day they
[45:01] came in this day
[45:03] and they want to throw off well you
[45:05] can't build the wall well you can't do
[45:06] this we're going to bring it to naught
[45:09] and we'll find here that anytime you
[45:12] start to do something for god you're
[45:13] going to face opposition
[45:15] and we notice the work cease for a
[45:17] little bit
[45:18] not permanently but it ceased for a
[45:20] little bit but god
[45:22] brought the enemy's plans to not
[45:25] god brought the enemy's plans to not and
[45:28] when nehemiah
[45:30] and the people begin to look back and
[45:32] they realize
[45:33] god brought our enemies plans to not
[45:36] they can't stop
[45:37] us from building the wall we've already
[45:40] started this work
[45:41] and he that started it is more than able
[45:44] to finish it
[45:45] so what did they leave they looked back
[45:46] from that time and they drew courage
[45:49] all the fear left and they had a courage
[45:51] to drive
[45:52] to finish what was started and i wanted
[45:54] to like young people
[45:56] oh can you realize what happened this
[45:58] past weekend
[45:59] or over last month in oklahoma can that
[46:01] be the driving
[46:02] force to finish what god has started
[46:05] you can look back from that time and
[46:08] realize that's the moment
[46:09] that i met god that's the moment that
[46:12] i've been changed
[46:13] that's the moment where god does
[46:15] something supernaturally
[46:16] for me give me give me a little bit more
[46:20] volume up here if you don't mind
[46:22] brother madam will say this in the
[46:23] message from that time he says you know
[46:26] we as humans
[46:27] we can all think of things as in a
[46:29] certain time such as things that are
[46:30] taking place
[46:32] you know many of us we have parents or
[46:33] grandparents they would always tell you
[46:35] that they trust over the hill
[46:38] both ways to school rain sleet hell and
[46:41] snow
[46:43] uphill both ways they don't ever tell
[46:46] you about the downhill but it's always
[46:47] up it's always the worst part of it
[46:49] and they always remember from that time
[46:52] they're always pointing back and we and
[46:54] brother ben would tell us we
[46:56] all as humans tonight can recall things
[46:59] from
[46:59] a certain time he says practice all of
[47:02] us here tonight could call
[47:04] to remember remembers of certain things
[47:06] that are taking place in a certain time
[47:08] and from that time something changed
[47:12] now notice it could be good things or it
[47:13] could be bad things
[47:16] but nevertheless we can recall a certain
[47:19] moment
[47:19] or a certain time or a certain event or
[47:22] a certain memory
[47:23] and we could go back think about this
[47:25] the gutenberg printing press
[47:27] it changed the world as we know it
[47:30] because before then there was the or the
[47:33] the literate the educated
[47:35] the elite that they are the only ones
[47:37] able to read and to write
[47:39] and now with the printing press it it it
[47:42] destroyed that or broke the monopoly of
[47:44] the literary elite
[47:45] and on education and it brought learning
[47:47] to everyone
[47:48] and it bolstered forth a middle-class
[47:50] people
[47:52] we look at the spanish influenza what it
[47:54] did in 1918
[47:55] in 1919 it increased the need for
[47:58] medical science to be able to devise a
[48:00] vaccine
[48:01] so it can vaccinate the people to combat
[48:03] the disease or the virus
[48:05] and yet it was because at that time that
[48:07] they were able in this day
[48:08] to come up with a vaccine within a year
[48:11] for coping 19.
[48:12] it's what they learn they look back to
[48:14] what took place in that time
[48:18] and we think about the stock market
[48:19] crash of 1929 and what did it do
[48:22] it was the longest economic downturn in
[48:25] western world
[48:27] but yet it was from that event that it
[48:30] changed how we do banking
[48:31] it changed how we how we invest in our
[48:33] stocks and bonds how everything is
[48:35] traded
[48:36] it was because of that event and we can
[48:39] look back today
[48:40] and realize that event is still having a
[48:43] lasting effect on
[48:44] us today
[48:47] you know brother danny made a comment
[48:49] this weekend i may say that a couple
[48:50] times in this service this evening
[48:53] and i told brother tim that this service
[48:55] is going to be more so directed to the
[48:56] young people
[48:57] but he said well good we're all young so
[49:00] what that tells me is i'm expecting
[49:02] eight minutes from the front to the back
[49:04] all right from the front to the back
[49:06] from the front to the back
[49:07] from the front to the back because we're
[49:10] all young people
[49:12] what we found he made a comment he said
[49:14] you know he says preaching
[49:16] is about moments
[49:19] preaching is about moments
[49:23] notice here now as i tell this story
[49:25] this is in 1958 the sin of unbelief
[49:28] brother brahma said some time ago i was
[49:30] speaking to a girl and i felt led
[49:31] just to say something to her and i said
[49:34] sister
[49:35] after the service was over i said would
[49:37] you come to christ
[49:40] she said i belong to a church and if i
[49:42] wanted somebody to speak to me i'd get a
[49:44] pastor
[49:45] that had some sense said
[49:48] don't you try to ever embarrass me i
[49:51] said well very well i'm sorry no one
[49:53] knows of this but you and i i didn't
[49:54] mean to embarrass you
[49:56] i only asked you because i and i said i
[49:58] felt led
[50:00] notice here a prophet of god is standing
[50:02] for this young teenage girl
[50:04] to lead her to the lord her moment
[50:08] and notice her response don't you ever
[50:10] try to embarrass me
[50:12] call me out speak to me aside make a
[50:15] public spectacle
[50:17] said i only asked because i felt led
[50:20] standing by the side of a little rose
[50:21] bush by a baptist church down in
[50:22] nashville tennessee
[50:24] never forgot that night the wind was
[50:26] blowing the moon was shining she turned
[50:28] her little painted lips up
[50:30] her little nose and she snickled away
[50:32] and met up with a bunch of boys
[50:34] and about a year later because i was
[50:37] walking down the street i seen a young
[50:38] lady walking down the street
[50:40] with her skirts terrible and i looked at
[50:42] her and i thought
[50:43] surely that's not her and i turned and i
[50:46] started following her she looked at me
[50:47] as they passed and i caught up with her
[50:49] and she said hello preacher
[50:51] she remembered that time
[50:55] hello preacher i said how do you do
[50:57] aren't you she said yes i
[50:58] am she stopped and she reached in her
[51:00] pocketbook pulled out a cigarette says
[51:03] have one i said shame on you
[51:06] she said well maybe you'll take a little
[51:07] drink out of my bottle and i said does
[51:09] your daddy know this
[51:11] he being a deacon in the church she said
[51:13] i want to tell you something preacher
[51:14] now listen young person
[51:16] said i want to tell you something
[51:17] preacher do you remember that night you
[51:19] spoke to me by the bush
[51:22] and i said out and he said i'll never
[51:24] forget it
[51:25] no it made a lasting impression on the
[51:28] prophet
[51:30] it was a moment it was her moment
[51:35] she said that was my last call
[51:41] what a moment what a time
[51:45] to recognize it was your last call
[51:49] she goes that was my last call and
[51:51] here's the remark that beautiful young
[51:53] woman made
[51:54] she she got to this she got to this
[51:57] modern teenage rock and roll stuff and
[51:59] she said
[52:01] preacher my heart is so hard
[52:04] till i could see my mother's soul frying
[52:07] hell
[52:08] like a pancake and laugh at it
[52:13] my heart had become so hard
[52:18] that i could see my mother's soul fry
[52:21] in hell like a pancake and laugh at it
[52:25] so we find this young girl had a moment
[52:30] and she can look back to a time that she
[52:32] recognized that was her opportunity
[52:35] that she could give her heart to god and
[52:37] live a life victorious
[52:38] but because of embarrassment because of
[52:41] bitterness because she felt he called
[52:43] her out
[52:43] she turned away not from a man but she
[52:46] turned away from
[52:48] god and her heart becomes so hardened
[52:51] that she could see her own mother
[52:53] the one who birthed her into this life
[52:55] the one who cared for
[52:56] the one who gave her son the one who
[52:58] nourished her she could see that
[53:00] soul burn in hell and sit back and laugh
[53:02] at it
[53:04] what a moment
[53:08] but i want you to know young people not
[53:09] every moment has to be like that
[53:13] oh what we've been experiencing and even
[53:15] like tabernacle what we've been
[53:17] experiencing
[53:17] at oklahoma youth camp not every moment
[53:20] has to be like that
[53:21] but i will tell you tonight you will
[53:23] have that moment
[53:25] and it may very well be your last moment
[53:28] but what decision are you gonna make
[53:30] tonight in this moment
[53:32] in this time this could be the the
[53:35] moment that you drive that stake down
[53:37] and through all the the time that you
[53:39] have left you can look back to this
[53:41] night
[53:42] and say that was my moment and from that
[53:45] time
[53:45] you either begin to walk toward god or
[53:48] you're walking away
[53:50] but i'm here to tell you tonight this
[53:52] ain't a song or this ain't a sermon
[53:54] about change because our chains are gone
[53:57] this ain't about the past because we're
[53:59] moving on
[54:00] somebody's going on with jesus
[54:02] somebody's made a declaration
[54:03] i'm gonna serve god i'm gonna follow god
[54:06] i'm gonna give god
[54:07] hallelujah i'm gonna give god my all
[54:11] i'm not going to lay down i'm not going
[54:13] to give up i'm not going to quit i'm
[54:15] going to march on with god
[54:17] and from this time i beg god
[54:21] oh hallelujah i found my freedom in
[54:24] jesus
[54:24] i found my victory in his word i found
[54:27] who i need
[54:28] and he's tased me and he's here tonight
[54:30] to change you
[54:38] we find our freedom in him
[54:41] not just on wednesday night not just on
[54:44] sunday morning but
[54:45] every day every day
[54:49] we wake up and he is our freedom
[54:54] take for instance tonight say we have a
[54:57] woman of ill fame
[54:58] she was not always a woman of hill fame
[55:02] no there was a time that she was good
[55:05] there was a time that she was righteous
[55:07] there was a time she may have been a
[55:08] moral girl but on a certain night
[55:12] a certain place a certain thing happened
[55:16] and since that time she got on the wrong
[55:18] road and her life had been marred with
[55:20] sin
[55:21] blackness darkness and only judgment
[55:23] awaits
[55:25] you know i grew up not in church so i
[55:27] went to public school
[55:29] and i did everything that they did and i
[55:32] remember a lot of girls as i was growing
[55:34] up
[55:34] 9th grade 10th grade that you had a lot
[55:37] of respect for
[55:38] because it seemed like they went against
[55:40] the norm
[55:41] we would call them good moral girls you
[55:43] didn't hear anything bad about them
[55:45] but all of a sudden they made a choice
[55:49] all of a sudden this girl that you used
[55:51] to or this person this young person
[55:53] that used to kind of maybe set up a
[55:55] little bit higher than the rest because
[55:57] they seem to live a moral life for a
[55:58] better life they didn't just go to the
[56:00] parties and things
[56:01] they made a conscious decision to fit in
[56:06] and whether it may have been the first
[56:07] drag off a cigarette or it may have been
[56:09] the first hit
[56:10] off some drugs some marijuana joint or
[56:12] the first drink of a bottle
[56:14] and from that time he led them down a
[56:17] spiral path
[56:18] to darkness to where now maybe they're
[56:20] sleeping with every other boy
[56:22] in the school and we find their life is
[56:24] ruined their character is ruined and
[56:26] you'll never
[56:27] get your character back
[56:31] young person protect your character with
[56:33] everything you got
[56:35] listen to me protect your character
[56:37] young girls you protect your character
[56:39] you guard it with everything you got
[56:41] don't you letting some little boy
[56:42] weasel his way into your heart you
[56:44] protect it
[56:45] [Music]
[56:48] i don't even know why i'm going there
[56:50] but protect it
[56:51] guard it watch over it draw your sword
[56:55] build walls around your heart then only
[56:57] that one person
[56:58] is able to ever be able to enter through
[57:00] the gates of your heart to win your
[57:01] affection
[57:04] we find here take a drunk for instance a
[57:06] drunk he never started off with the
[57:08] intention of being drunk
[57:10] but no maybe he points back to a time
[57:12] brother brandon would would tell us
[57:14] that he was in new york with another
[57:15] preacher and they went down to this this
[57:17] drunk alley there
[57:18] there's drunks all over the place and he
[57:20] reached down to one and said you know
[57:22] hey let me just try to talk to him why
[57:24] are you here what did you do and
[57:26] he couldn't get a response out of the
[57:27] drum so the other preacher reached down
[57:29] there
[57:30] and he says now hey who are you why are
[57:31] you here and i'm just paraphrasing for
[57:34] the sake of time tonight
[57:35] and the drunk said oh if you just buy me
[57:37] a another drink i'll tell you my story
[57:39] he says now we can't do that we don't
[57:41] want to add to your sorrows
[57:42] but they finally got this drunk aroused
[57:44] enough to come to his senses enough that
[57:46] he could point back to the moment
[57:49] he could point back to an event that
[57:51] caused him
[57:52] to be there with all the other drunks
[57:55] and he said i came home from work one
[57:56] day he was a bank president
[58:00] a bank president no doubt made six
[58:02] figures
[58:03] had a good life of since we would look
[58:05] at him or he dressed in a three-piece
[58:07] suit and
[58:08] drove a nice car lived in a nice house
[58:10] and you think all that is happiness
[58:12] there was something missing and we found
[58:14] there was a dear john letter wrote for
[58:15] him when he got off work maybe came in a
[58:18] little bit late
[58:19] because he had to close the month out
[58:24] some of y'all get that later he had to
[58:27] close the month out so he worked a
[58:28] little bit late but when he got home he
[58:30] saw a dear john letter
[58:31] dear john i don't love you no more
[58:36] i took the kids and we're gone
[58:41] and maybe she left with another man
[58:43] another man that she allowed to get past
[58:45] those gates
[58:46] and win her affection and so he comes to
[58:49] his reality
[58:50] he says i can either shoot my brains out
[58:53] or i can go down to the saloon and he
[58:56] made a choice
[58:57] to go to the saloon and become a drunk
[58:59] on skid row
[59:01] because he looked back to a moment in a
[59:04] time
[59:05] that drove him or had an influence on
[59:09] him to drive him
[59:10] down a certain way and we find that it
[59:13] happens
[59:13] oh so many times but we don't have to
[59:16] allow the negative things in our life
[59:18] to influence us but if we're going to
[59:21] allow them to influence us
[59:23] let them allow them to influence us to
[59:25] things that are eternal
[59:27] you know i remember and i told you over
[59:28] and over and it seems like that's what
[59:30] we do as preachers
[59:31] we tell our own testimony over and over
[59:33] and over and maybe you don't realize
[59:36] how impactful that testimony has become
[59:38] to us
[59:39] but if you were where i was 20 something
[59:41] years ago when you were struck
[59:43] out of your mind driving your car at a
[59:45] high rate of speed ready to commit
[59:47] suicide and the angel the lord comes
[59:49] down
[59:49] and says turn your car around let me
[59:51] tell you that'll do something for you
[59:54] you can point back to that time that
[59:55] devil would come and lying you're saying
[59:57] you don't have it you never got nothing
[59:59] i can point back to that moment
[1:00:01] i can point back to that time i turned
[1:00:03] around i've been different
[1:00:05] i've been changed why because the angel
[1:00:07] of the lord came down
[1:00:09] and he's here to come down tonight i
[1:00:12] tell some of you young people
[1:00:14] it's not too late turn your car around
[1:00:17] turn your life around jump back home
[1:00:24] you can turn to something that has
[1:00:27] eternal benefit
[1:00:28] you can turn to something that's got
[1:00:31] eternal life in it
[1:00:33] there's a time where a man can come
[1:00:36] to something that's eternal
[1:00:40] some of you tonight you've had things
[1:00:42] nagging at you
[1:00:44] you've had spirits bumping into you
[1:00:46] trying to invade your space
[1:00:49] trying to influence you try to get you
[1:00:51] to doubt
[1:00:52] try to get you to quit trying to get you
[1:00:54] to give up
[1:00:57] trying to tell you you didn't get
[1:00:58] nothing friday you didn't get nothing
[1:01:01] saturday
[1:01:01] you didn't get nothing sunday you just
[1:01:04] didn't get nothing
[1:01:05] but i'm here to tell you if you can
[1:01:07] point that devil
[1:01:08] back to what you got that's where it's
[1:01:11] going to take place
[1:01:12] young person you got to realize i got to
[1:01:15] point him back to a time
[1:01:17] back to a time where i met face to face
[1:01:20] i came in a parallel
[1:01:21] but i walked out different combat came
[1:01:24] packing the devil
[1:01:24] but i left dancing in victory i left for
[1:01:27] choices because while
[1:01:28] i met god at a certain service
[1:01:32] and from that time i've been changed
[1:01:36] and from that time i've been different
[1:01:40] see when you come in the presence of the
[1:01:43] angel
[1:01:44] you cannot lead the same
[1:01:48] you know we make our vows at new year's

[1:02:17] it don't matter but we make our vows we
[1:02:20] make our
[1:02:21] so we're going to turn a new page you
[1:02:23] know many times that's how we come
[1:02:25] that's the mentality that maybe some of
[1:02:27] our young people that come to the altar
[1:02:29] i'm going to be different and it's you
[1:02:31] doing it
[1:02:32] and we appreciate your effort but you
[1:02:34] got to get to a point
[1:02:35] like buddy robinson look i'm coming up
[1:02:37] here he's going to give me the holy
[1:02:39] ghost and if i'm going to stay here
[1:02:40] until he does
[1:02:41] unless or if he doesn't i'm going to be
[1:02:43] a pile of bones when he comes back
[1:02:46] we got to get to that same determination
[1:02:48] we're going to serve god
[1:02:49] we're going to love god we're going to
[1:02:51] point we're going to drive down a stake
[1:02:53] in our time and we're going to anger our
[1:02:55] soul to it and we're never going to look
[1:02:56] back to the world see a man can come to
[1:03:02] god
[1:03:04] and his whole eternal destination can be
[1:03:06] changed
[1:03:09] i'm looking at men i'm looking at men
[1:03:12] and women right here tonight
[1:03:13] come to god in their entire eternal
[1:03:17] destination has been changed
[1:03:21] i look at a man back over here looked up
[1:03:24] at a water tower
[1:03:25] that's all it took a water tower looked
[1:03:28] to another young man
[1:03:30] all the parents didn't come home at 11
[1:03:32] o'clock
[1:03:34] but god used god used that
[1:03:37] lake coming home for a purpose to bring
[1:03:39] a prodigal back to himself
[1:03:42] i look at another young man now one of
[1:03:44] the greatest gifts in this church
[1:03:46] come to a youth service and i was
[1:03:48] casting the net and casting the net
[1:03:50] and casting it trying to catch the young
[1:03:51] man that was behind him
[1:03:53] and he got caught up in the net but let
[1:03:55] me tell you oh what a catch we got that
[1:03:57] night and andrew tushner
[1:03:59] what a great gift what a great blessing
[1:04:01] he's been to even like tabernacle
[1:04:03] the young boy skateboarder punk going
[1:04:06] out drinking and doing god knows what
[1:04:08] there's no desire to serve god but one
[1:04:10] night in a youth meeting
[1:04:12] and tonight he can point back to that
[1:04:14] time he can point back to that service
[1:04:16] that's where it changed that's where my
[1:04:18] life turned that's where everything
[1:04:20] changed for me and i'm not the same
[1:04:22] i don't have the same desires it all
[1:04:25] changed
[1:04:27] and we got to get to that point young
[1:04:29] people let me say it like this we got to
[1:04:31] get to that point old people
[1:04:34] sometimes we think we've been in a
[1:04:35] message 20 years 30 years
[1:04:37] we don't need to make a move shame on
[1:04:38] you your heart needs to be tender enough
[1:04:41] to make a move toward god
[1:04:42] [Applause]
[1:04:48] god wants everybody god had grace for
[1:04:52] cain
[1:04:54] genesis 4 7 if thou doest well shall not
[1:04:57] be
[1:04:58] shall not be accepted so don't tell me
[1:05:01] tonight
[1:05:02] you can't live for god god's not calling
[1:05:06] god calls all everybody has an
[1:05:08] opportunity
[1:05:10] see we got to meet god not meet a
[1:05:12] doctrine
[1:05:14] not meet a church creed or church
[1:05:16] ideology
[1:05:17] or some man's idea but we got to get to
[1:05:20] a place
[1:05:21] until we actually meet god
[1:05:25] we actually encounter our moment
[1:05:30] and forever and forever
[1:05:33] and forever it has changed not only are
[1:05:36] you changed here
[1:05:37] but you're changed over there it changes
[1:05:39] your eternal destination
[1:05:42] think about this last time i spoke we
[1:05:45] spoke about the prodigal son
[1:05:47] how it's not the end of your story let
[1:05:50] me just
[1:05:50] pick back up if y'all don't mind on the
[1:05:52] prodigal son just for a minute
[1:05:54] here he was slopping the swine
[1:05:58] man his life had hit rock bottom he was
[1:06:01] the dregs of humanity the scum of the
[1:06:03] earth
[1:06:04] filthy stinking loss away from home no
[1:06:06] hope no future
[1:06:08] no promise of tomorrow
[1:06:11] you will look at him and say he don't
[1:06:13] have
[1:06:14] a chance
[1:06:19] he don't have a chance but he met god
[1:06:24] despite your unbelief despite
[1:06:27] the way you would judge him despite how
[1:06:29] he looked at him despite everything he's
[1:06:32] ever done despite
[1:06:33] him being living there with the swine
[1:06:35] and feeding the swine and eating
[1:06:36] pizza despite all that the angel of the
[1:06:40] lord came to him
[1:06:41] and shook him he said arise
[1:06:44] go back to your father's house
[1:06:47] and from that time he pulled himself
[1:06:50] together the best that he could
[1:06:52] and began to march on back to his
[1:06:54] father's house and i can just picture as
[1:06:56] he's going through
[1:06:57] maybe the city some of the unfamiliar
[1:06:59] places that he used to hang out at
[1:07:01] some of his old friends would come hey
[1:07:02] hey proddy come over here
[1:07:05] come back in here let's hang out a
[1:07:06] little bit we've all missed you you used
[1:07:08] to be the life of the party
[1:07:10] oh but used to where he used to be
[1:07:12] tempted and where he used to give in now
[1:07:14] he just keeps on walking
[1:07:16] he just keeps on walking how can he keep
[1:07:19] walking brother joe because he met the
[1:07:21] angel
[1:07:22] oh his spiritual amnesia had left now he
[1:07:25] realizes who i am
[1:07:26] i'm not a swine bobber i'm not somebody
[1:07:29] that's no count
[1:07:30] no good for nothing my father is a
[1:07:32] wealthy man our father is a wealthy man
[1:07:34] you belong to the king of kings and the
[1:07:37] lord of lords
[1:07:38] all you got to do is awaken yourself and
[1:07:40] come back to the father
[1:07:42] he turned down temptation he turned down
[1:07:44] the women
[1:07:45] he turned down the alcohol because his
[1:07:47] desires were
[1:07:48] changed his desires were
[1:07:52] changed in one moment
[1:07:56] because in one moment the angel
[1:08:00] of the lord came to his filthy dwelling
[1:08:05] one moment so i don't care where you are
[1:08:08] tonight
[1:08:09] i don't care where your loved one is
[1:08:10] tonight god
[1:08:13] will come to your filthy dwelling
[1:08:17] and god has a purpose and a plan for
[1:08:21] coming
[1:08:22] for your life he's not going to leave
[1:08:24] you the way he finds you
[1:08:27] come on some of you older people in the
[1:08:29] back back here need to rekindle that
[1:08:31] experience
[1:08:32] maybe you down there and you don't lost
[1:08:34] your feel for god and lost your love for
[1:08:35] god but i'm here to tell you
[1:08:37] all you got to do is come to yourself
[1:08:39] and realize why am i here
[1:08:41] i don't want to be here i don't want to
[1:08:43] be this way i want to be a real
[1:08:45] son of god i want to go back to my
[1:08:47] father's house
[1:08:52] you know abraham met god out there doing
[1:08:54] whatever he was doing
[1:08:56] shepherding picking berries doing
[1:08:57] whatever but there was a time
[1:09:00] the voice of god came down and spoke to
[1:09:02] abraham abraham it's time for you to
[1:09:03] leave the land of the chaldeans you need
[1:09:06] to depart from your
[1:09:07] your father and i'm going to take you to
[1:09:09] a city
[1:09:11] i'm going to take you somewhere and
[1:09:13] abraham
[1:09:14] oh he will begin to set out on this
[1:09:17] journey
[1:09:18] begin to follow this unseen god but he
[1:09:21] knew
[1:09:21] he heard the voice he knew he had met
[1:09:24] god and when god
[1:09:25] promised abraham that he was going to
[1:09:27] have a son and yet his body is old and
[1:09:29] his body is dead and
[1:09:30] his wife's body is dead yet the same god
[1:09:33] that spoke to him
[1:09:34] in the land of her the city of the
[1:09:36] chaldeans was the same god that spoke to
[1:09:38] him there
[1:09:38] and he had enough faith he could look
[1:09:40] back and say that god has never
[1:09:42] failed me and i'm saying he won't fail
[1:09:44] me today no matter how old i get
[1:09:46] how decrepit i get how dead my body
[1:09:48] becomes he won't fail me he's not
[1:09:50] failing me yet
[1:09:56] see abraham can look back he can look
[1:09:59] back to a time
[1:10:01] to where god moved
[1:10:04] many of you came in the prayer line many
[1:10:06] of you i spoke to after the prayer line
[1:10:08] and i ask you if god did something for
[1:10:10] you write it down in your bible
[1:10:12] write the date down we said brother joe
[1:10:15] come on that sounds a little bit
[1:10:16] odd well it's only odd if you want to be
[1:10:19] hot
[1:10:21] because what you're doing is physically
[1:10:22] driving a steak down
[1:10:24] this right here anytime
[1:10:28] your memory may fail you when you flip
[1:10:30] that follow if open
[1:10:31] it's right there right there april 4th
[1:10:35] right there something happened april 3rd
[1:10:38] 20 21 my life was changed 20
[1:10:41] 21 april 4th i got delivered i came in a
[1:10:44] prayer line
[1:10:45] i walked away different i asked god to
[1:10:47] give me my dancing he gave me more than
[1:10:48] a dance he gave me joy
[1:10:49] unspeakable and full of glory i asked
[1:10:51] god that i needed deliverance and god
[1:10:53] not only gave me deliverance but he gave
[1:10:54] me the holy ghost i asked god i need
[1:10:56] direction not only did god give you
[1:10:57] direction he told you exactly where you
[1:10:59] needed to be
[1:11:01] you write it down what does it do it
[1:11:02] reminds not only you when you can't see
[1:11:05] and you get feeble and sometimes you may
[1:11:07] come into amnesia but it also reminds
[1:11:09] that devil
[1:11:09] what god has done for you because you've
[1:11:11] got to eat down there and yeah you can
[1:11:13] point that devil back
[1:11:14] this is it right here i can open it up
[1:11:17] that's where i've been changed
[1:11:18] that's what god's done for me take that
[1:11:20] devil i'm not the same
[1:11:22] i don't have the same desire i don't
[1:11:24] have the same desire ideas
[1:11:25] i've been changed because my i was in
[1:11:28] the presence of the angel
[1:11:33] the man will say that's when a man meets
[1:11:34] god it changes his makeup
[1:11:36] it gives him a super sense
[1:11:41] gives him a super sense my my my
[1:11:45] clock is running crazy see when a man
[1:11:48] meets
[1:11:48] god something takes place
[1:11:54] see the super scent supersedes
[1:11:57] anything that we can taste phil smelling
[1:12:00] here
[1:12:01] it controls the five senses see the five
[1:12:04] senses
[1:12:05] will tell you when you feel the
[1:12:07] anointing of the holy ghost come down
[1:12:08] to stay in your seat because
[1:12:12] it's not normal for you to act the way
[1:12:14] you act when the holy spirit falls on
[1:12:16] you
[1:12:17] but if you allow that super sense to
[1:12:19] take over
[1:12:20] you'll find yourself laughing
[1:12:22] uncontrollably you'll find yourself
[1:12:24] running around the church you'll find
[1:12:26] yourself dancing in the spirit
[1:12:27] because why because that super sense
[1:12:30] makes you act in ways you wouldn't
[1:12:31] normally act
[1:12:33] because that super sense is the is the
[1:12:35] holy ghost the problem of god will say
[1:12:36] it's the holy ghost coming down and it
[1:12:38] overrides all the other false senses
[1:12:43] the problem is some of us can't get out
[1:12:46] of the way long enough
[1:12:47] to allow that super sense to take over
[1:12:50] you feel the spirit
[1:12:51] move by you how many you've ever felt
[1:12:54] the spirit moved by
[1:12:55] and you just quenched it not me
[1:13:00] not me i ain't gonna look like that run
[1:13:04] like that
[1:13:04] act like that when we then we
[1:13:07] then we we look back at these young
[1:13:09] people
[1:13:12] we don't need that like that in church
[1:13:14] shame on you you ain't met god
[1:13:18] i told the young people when i got the
[1:13:20] holy ghost i didn't jump and shout
[1:13:22] i didn't have that i can't tie my
[1:13:24] experience back to that
[1:13:25] but i know i got it how do you know
[1:13:27] brother joe because my desires are
[1:13:29] different
[1:13:30] the things i used to desire without the
[1:13:32] holy ghost i don't desire no more
[1:13:35] look i got i got an ipad i got an iphone
[1:13:37] i got computers i got everything
[1:13:38] i don't have no kind of protection on
[1:13:40] them why because i got the protection of
[1:13:41] the holy ghost
[1:13:42] he guards me i'm not saying that to prop
[1:13:45] myself up i'm just telling you that's
[1:13:46] what the holy ghost can do for you
[1:13:49] the holy ghost can take that desire out
[1:13:51] of your heart well you used to want to
[1:13:52] look at those kind of things
[1:13:53] now it makes you want to get into the
[1:13:54] word where you study the gifts of god
[1:13:56] and what god has for you in this hour
[1:14:01] so we find some of this past weekend
[1:14:03] some of you got so drunk on the spirit
[1:14:06] he was acting in ways that defied the
[1:14:09] five senses
[1:14:12] see that's what happens and no matter
[1:14:14] how hard you could try
[1:14:17] without that sixth sense you would look
[1:14:19] like a total fool trying to act drunk
[1:14:23] you can't do it you've got to get
[1:14:26] intoxicated
[1:14:27] to act like a drunk man and you're not
[1:14:30] acting at that point you're drunk
[1:14:32] so when you allow that sixth sense to
[1:14:34] add super sense to overtake you
[1:14:36] and lift you up into the heavenly places
[1:14:38] where you met
[1:14:39] god and god's come down and broke the
[1:14:41] shackles and feathers off your life
[1:14:43] you got a reason to to dance you got a
[1:14:45] reason to get drunk you got a reason to
[1:14:48] laugh
[1:14:48] in the devil's face because why because
[1:14:50] god has come down
[1:14:51] and changed the devil's plans and
[1:14:53] brought his desires for you
[1:14:54] to not well he thought he was going to
[1:14:57] destroy you when he thought he was going
[1:14:58] to
[1:14:59] get you to commit suicide or give up and
[1:15:01] turn back to the world
[1:15:02] god comes down in a weekend service and
[1:15:05] changes your very makeup
[1:15:07] where you want to give up where you
[1:15:08] wanted to quit god came down and give
[1:15:10] you that power
[1:15:11] and said you're not a quitter you're a
[1:15:13] finisher
[1:15:15] born it is coming oh ain't nobody's
[1:15:17] gonna hold me down
[1:15:18] i've been born for this moment god throw
[1:15:21] me here for this time
[1:15:28] hallelujah
[1:15:33] there was a sister over the weekend
[1:15:37] came in a prayer lie bound by fear
[1:15:41] her family had a history of issues
[1:15:43] schizophrenia
[1:15:45] she was fearful that these things would
[1:15:48] would take over her and
[1:15:49] she'd come underneath that and become
[1:15:52] that
[1:15:53] very reserved sister
[1:15:58] brother aaron and i began to pray with
[1:15:59] her she'd come up and we'll just begin
[1:16:01] to tell us these things
[1:16:02] but then i began to begin to pray and
[1:16:04] the lord began to speak to her in a
[1:16:05] personal
[1:16:06] way she began to jump
[1:16:10] she'd been a shout but it was more than
[1:16:13] just a jump and a shout
[1:16:15] a revelation broke forth in her i don't
[1:16:17] have to be that that may have been
[1:16:20] underneath my first birth but i've been
[1:16:22] born again of the spirit of god
[1:16:24] i don't have to fear being a schizo i
[1:16:26] don't have to fear any of that kind of
[1:16:27] thing
[1:16:28] no because why because we begin to tell
[1:16:30] her you're a daughter of god you never
[1:16:31] was and that yeah
[1:16:33] you never belonged to the devil to begin
[1:16:35] with you've always belonged to god
[1:16:37] and that revelation dropped down and
[1:16:39] they told us some of her
[1:16:40] some of the people from dallas told us
[1:16:42] that that's not like her
[1:16:44] she never has done that in her life and
[1:16:46] they've been to church with her for a
[1:16:47] long time
[1:16:48] that's not her nature to do that but let
[1:16:49] me tell you when you come in the
[1:16:50] presence
[1:16:51] of the angel oh he'll get you to do
[1:16:54] things you wouldn't normally do
[1:16:55] and i could testify on brother aaron can
[1:16:57] too when we came and stepped in
[1:16:59] right up here the presence of almighty
[1:17:01] god met with us
[1:17:02] it wasn't brother aaron it wasn't
[1:17:04] brother joe it wasn't the effort of a
[1:17:06] man but the angel of the lord stood
[1:17:08] right here
[1:17:09] dog patient after patient after patient
[1:17:12] and wanted to do he deserved
[1:17:13] and he cast out and he brought
[1:17:15] deliverance and he brought the holy
[1:17:16] ghost and he brought healing he did it
[1:17:18] right here
[1:17:20] and you can tie yourself back to that
[1:17:22] moment
[1:17:23] that's where i met god that's where i
[1:17:25] got free that's where i got delivered
[1:17:27] that's what service i got the holy ghost
[1:17:33] right there he lay hands on
[1:17:37] them and before you say one word five
[1:17:39] seconds
[1:17:40] in they're out brother aaron i don't
[1:17:42] know but have you ever just
[1:17:44] laid hands on somebody and they went out
[1:17:45] like that under your own power
[1:17:47] for the tim we don't have that power we
[1:17:50] don't have that capability
[1:17:51] what am i telling you church i'm telling
[1:17:53] you that the holy ghost
[1:17:55] that the angel of the lord visits this
[1:17:57] church
[1:17:58] [Music]
[1:17:59] service after service well why do they
[1:18:02] have to act like that
[1:18:03] take it up with the angel why don't they
[1:18:06] gotta dance and jump and shout and
[1:18:08] scream
[1:18:08] and they laugh in the spirit take it up
[1:18:10] with the angel but i'm here to tell you
[1:18:12] as long as he's coming i'm coming in i'm
[1:18:15] stepping in
[1:18:16] i'm going to have my moment i'm going to
[1:18:18] have my change i'm going to have my
[1:18:20] opportunity
[1:18:20] i'm going to go down my stake i'm going
[1:18:23] to point the devil
[1:18:24] back to that service that's where
[1:18:27] that's where from that time from that
[1:18:30] service
[1:18:31] the chains broke liberation came the
[1:18:33] holy ghost fell
[1:18:35] i'm free i'm free tonight
[1:18:40] no longer bound by feet
[1:18:56] hallelujah see the holy ghost
[1:19:01] is that super sense see
[1:19:04] abraham against hope he believed in hope
[1:19:09] being not weak in faith the bible said
[1:19:12] he
[1:19:13] he considered not the weakness of his
[1:19:15] own body
[1:19:16] or the deadness of his own body and the
[1:19:19] bible say he staggered
[1:19:20] not you face a lot of opposition
[1:19:24] here in laodicea but don't stagger young
[1:19:28] person
[1:19:29] don't stagger mom and dad i'll stagger
[1:19:31] her mamaw papaw
[1:19:33] however you want to say that grandma
[1:19:34] granddad however you like to say it
[1:19:37] don't stagger don't stack it through
[1:19:39] unbelief
[1:19:40] don't stagger because you're in a trial
[1:19:43] don't give up god knows what's best for
[1:19:44] you let me give you one word of
[1:19:46] confidence like
[1:19:46] god doesn't make mistakes god doesn't
[1:19:49] make mistakes
[1:19:50] if god brought you to it he's going to
[1:19:52] bring you through it
[1:19:54] all right notice here a young teenage
[1:19:57] boy
[1:19:58] that some of y'all can can kind of fit
[1:20:00] in with this young teenage boy
[1:20:01] we all know his name is david david one
[1:20:04] time he encountered a bear
[1:20:07] stole a little sheep well you know that
[1:20:10] bear's bigger than me i guess that
[1:20:12] little sheep would just let it go off no
[1:20:13] that wasn't david's mentality david
[1:20:16] wasn't going to give a sheep up
[1:20:17] he wasn't going to give a hoof up he
[1:20:20] said david said that's mine
[1:20:22] see some of us we live and we compromise
[1:20:24] a lot of times with the devil
[1:20:26] well i guess i can just live with this
[1:20:28] i'll figure out how to get through this
[1:20:29] let me tell you
[1:20:30] brother danny was conveying a story to
[1:20:31] me and brother aaron in the back room
[1:20:33] the other night
[1:20:33] said about a brother that was coming to
[1:20:35] his church and he was bound by a bunch
[1:20:37] of different things and
[1:20:38] a long time ago he went to a certain
[1:20:39] church and a certain brother prayed for
[1:20:41] him
[1:20:41] and he said lord we ask that you give
[1:20:43] this brother a season of victories
[1:20:46] and that brother got a season of
[1:20:48] victories
[1:20:49] he got a season of victories let me tell
[1:20:51] you when the season was up
[1:20:53] everything came rushing back on him and
[1:20:55] he was a troubled man
[1:20:56] i'm gonna tell you even like tabernacle
[1:20:58] we don't preach a season of victories
[1:21:00] we preach the holy ghost we preach total
[1:21:02] victory we preach total annihilation
[1:21:04] we preach deliverance and total
[1:21:06] deliverance and you can point back to
[1:21:08] that time
[1:21:10] not a season but a real experience where
[1:21:13] you met god
[1:21:14] [Applause]
[1:21:20] thank you sir so we find david
[1:21:23] the bear come up
[1:21:28] took a little slingshot bam knocked the
[1:21:29] bear down got sheep back
[1:21:31] great story that's how we read it ain't
[1:21:34] it black and white
[1:21:35] we read it like a newspaper article well
[1:21:37] did you read that story today brother
[1:21:38] there was another a line came up roar
[1:21:41] david knocked it down split his throat
[1:21:43] got the sheep back i'm gonna tell you if
[1:21:46] david was telling this story it'd be
[1:21:47] more emphatic and more intense than that
[1:21:51] he wouldn't just be oh well that's a
[1:21:52] pretty good story here's his 14 year old
[1:21:54] kid got a little sling in his hand
[1:21:56] he's poorly dressed little ruddy guy he
[1:21:57] ain't very big you know probably looks
[1:21:59] like austin
[1:22:00] also knocked his below his pale boy just
[1:22:01] a little bit short thing and you know
[1:22:03] and
[1:22:03] he wouldn't think he could do anything
[1:22:04] right little bitty frail skinny little
[1:22:06] fella
[1:22:06] don't wear buckle five
[1:22:10] that's how we read the bible sometimes
[1:22:12] but put yourself where david was at
[1:22:15] put yourself when david come against
[1:22:16] that bear david knew that there was no
[1:22:18] human ability
[1:22:20] that he possessed that should be able to
[1:22:22] kill a bear that was grave big
[1:22:24] a wild beastly animal but the anointing
[1:22:26] of the holy ghost came upon david
[1:22:28] and brought david the victory and when
[1:22:30] the line rose up
[1:22:32] the same holy ghost fell again and
[1:22:34] brought david another victory david had
[1:22:36] an experience
[1:22:37] upon the experience and began to add to
[1:22:39] his experience and when he faced goliath
[1:22:41] he didn't shudder
[1:22:42] he didn't fret he didn't go and don't
[1:22:43] believe he said come here boy
[1:22:45] i'm ready for the job i've had a moment
[1:22:48] with the bear
[1:22:48] i've had a moment with the line i've had
[1:22:50] my moment i'm gonna tell you
[1:22:53] ain't nothing cause i'm distorting me
[1:22:55] i'm a son of god
[1:22:57] i know my position i've had an
[1:22:59] experience
[1:23:00] i can point back i can point back to a
[1:23:03] time
[1:23:04] where i met god there was no future
[1:23:06] possibility
[1:23:08] but god but god
[1:23:17] david would point back to a time
[1:23:20] and from that time he never feared
[1:23:25] from that time he never worried
[1:23:29] he knew he met samuel and samuel had
[1:23:32] anointed him
[1:23:33] to be a king oh young person
[1:23:37] mom and dad we have been anointed in
[1:23:40] laodicea
[1:23:42] to sit with the king we have been
[1:23:44] anointed
[1:23:45] to be the bride of christ we have been
[1:23:49] anointed not just by a prophet but by
[1:23:52] the seventh angel
[1:23:53] by the messenger by the one who's going
[1:23:55] to close it all
[1:23:56] wrap all the loose sins and reveal the
[1:23:58] mysteries you
[1:23:59] have been anointed by that angel
[1:24:04] why do we fret why do we fear it's only
[1:24:07] the father trying to bring you the
[1:24:08] revelation of the word
[1:24:11] notice now see the problem is
[1:24:14] the bible would tell us in ephesians 6
[1:24:16] 12 we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:24:18] blood
[1:24:19] but against principalities and against
[1:24:21] powers against rulers of darkness
[1:24:23] of this world against spiritual
[1:24:24] wickedness in high places
[1:24:26] so the things that you face here is
[1:24:29] greater than what david
[1:24:30] faced there you face depression
[1:24:33] you face suicide you face anxieties
[1:24:37] some of you face fear you know what fear
[1:24:40] is
[1:24:41] fear is keeping you bound and keeping
[1:24:44] you living free
[1:24:45] while you're alive because you're afraid
[1:24:47] to do anything
[1:24:48] you're afraid to go anywhere you're
[1:24:50] afraid to step out and trust god
[1:24:53] but i want you to know fear is a liar
[1:24:58] see what we face is greater than what
[1:25:01] they face
[1:25:02] sister atlanta stage four lymphoma
[1:25:05] cancer
[1:25:06] and with that no doubt most likely came
[1:25:09] fear
[1:25:10] fear the unknown fear how she was gonna
[1:25:12] how severe the case was gonna be
[1:25:14] severe if even death would take her life
[1:25:16] severe hit the children severe hit the
[1:25:18] father
[1:25:18] what's gonna happen to my wife what's
[1:25:20] gonna happen to my you know my mom
[1:25:21] what's gonna happen
[1:25:22] see there's no human possibility for a
[1:25:24] little frail woman whose lungs on one
[1:25:26] side was full of cancer
[1:25:28] but god but god
[1:25:31] anointed sister atlanta in the butt's
[1:25:33] family for victory
[1:25:35] did you hear what i said anointed them
[1:25:38] for victory well
[1:25:40] what are you saying brother joe does the
[1:25:42] did they ever worry anymore
[1:25:43] no i doubt they have any kind of concern
[1:25:45] about word because
[1:25:46] all of that family can point back to a
[1:25:48] moment that little sister got down and
[1:25:50] began to run around this altar began to
[1:25:52] run around the church
[1:25:53] why because she caught the revelation
[1:25:55] i'm leaning on the everlasting hand
[1:25:57] or the everlasting arm of the almighty
[1:25:59] and when you can realize that's where
[1:26:00] your faith is anchored that's where your
[1:26:02] soul is
[1:26:03] is tied to it's not tied to some man
[1:26:05] it's not tied to some preacher
[1:26:06] it's not tied to some doctor but it's
[1:26:09] tied to jesus
[1:26:10] oh when you got cancer you can dance
[1:26:13] when you got fear
[1:26:14] you can fake free from it when you got
[1:26:16] brain bleed you can know that you're
[1:26:17] god's still healed
[1:26:18] you're god's still safe you're god's
[1:26:20] still delivered
[1:26:25] sister karen faced a midline shift there
[1:26:27] was no human possibility
[1:26:29] to hurt for her to make it doctor told
[1:26:32] me she's got five minutes
[1:26:34] maybe five years but she'll be in a
[1:26:36] vegetable state
[1:26:38] but god but god
[1:26:42] why did god do these things it's a
[1:26:46] landmark
[1:26:48] brother johnny you can look back to
[1:26:50] sister atlanta's testimony
[1:26:51] and say and realize that same god is
[1:26:54] your god
[1:26:56] that same god delivers sister karen is
[1:26:59] your god tonight
[1:27:02] it's a landmark you can look back this
[1:27:04] church can look
[1:27:05] back and say god god saves are god
[1:27:09] healed cancer is not bigger than our god
[1:27:14] brain bleeds is not bigger than our
[1:27:17] gospel why
[1:27:18] does god do these things he does it
[1:27:22] so that you can have the assurance that
[1:27:24] he will do what he says he'll do
[1:27:28] he will he has destroyed
[1:27:32] the enemy's plans see when god promises
[1:27:36] god will keep his word when god promised
[1:27:39] to heal you he will do it when god
[1:27:41] promised to give you the holy ghost
[1:27:43] he will do it
[1:27:46] so don't come to me and say it doesn't
[1:27:48] work it does work
[1:27:50] i can testify it's life-changing power
[1:27:53] i can tell you that the holy ghost is
[1:27:55] real i can tell you that deliverance and
[1:27:57] healing is real
[1:27:58] i can look at them cases after cases our
[1:28:01] god is a deliverer
[1:28:03] our god is awesome our god is mighty our
[1:28:06] god is able to do exceeded
[1:28:08] abundantly above all that we can even
[1:28:10] ask or think if we could just let
[1:28:11] ourselves
[1:28:12] get away from our five senses and came
[1:28:15] into the presence of the angel
[1:28:17] unreserved say god here i am
[1:28:21] i'm going to let go i'm in your presence
[1:28:24] oh my brother said what the ministry
[1:28:26] needs tonight
[1:28:28] there's not so many bas and dd's but it
[1:28:30] needs an experience of the baptism of
[1:28:32] the holy ghost
[1:28:33] that puts life into the man and gives
[1:28:35] him faith in a living god
[1:28:37] that change is not an experience
[1:28:41] so that's kind of where i'm driving this
[1:28:42] home to tonight what the ministry needs
[1:28:44] is not trying to extinguish the fire
[1:28:46] that said even like tabernacle
[1:28:49] no won't you stop trying to put the fire
[1:28:51] out and come and join us
[1:28:54] come on down here to louisiana we invite
[1:28:58] you
[1:28:58] one and all come and taste and see that
[1:29:01] god is good
[1:29:02] and i'm gonna promise you one thing when
[1:29:04] you come in the presence of the angel
[1:29:06] and he meets you at this altar you will
[1:29:08] not go home the same
[1:29:10] you may go home staggering you may go
[1:29:12] home drunk you may even speak in tongues
[1:29:14] but one thing's for sure
[1:29:15] you will not go home the same criticizer
[1:29:18] that you came with
[1:29:20] because god is giving a promise that he
[1:29:22] will meet you
[1:29:23] if you come with a real heart i want to
[1:29:25] meet god
[1:29:26] i want to have a real experience i don't
[1:29:28] want to be this way any longer
[1:29:30] god is obligated to meet you
[1:29:33] god is obligated to do something for you
[1:29:38] hallelujah
[1:29:42] we need to set aside our theological
[1:29:43] ideas
[1:29:46] set aside how well you can explain the
[1:29:48] mysteries
[1:29:49] i don't care how well you can explain
[1:29:52] the mystery
[1:29:53] it don't bother me i like teaching
[1:29:58] but i love anointed preaching amen
[1:30:01] i love teaching it grounds you it
[1:30:03] solidifies you it ties you back
[1:30:05] where you know the foundation you stand
[1:30:07] on that's all good but that's all you
[1:30:09] got
[1:30:09] and i don't want it if all you got is
[1:30:13] teaching i don't want it you better give
[1:30:14] me some anointed holy ghost preaching to
[1:30:16] go with it
[1:30:17] you better give me some fire you better
[1:30:19] give me some some of that real and
[1:30:21] knowing that real intoxication
[1:30:22] so when i come out of that service i
[1:30:24] could take some i could take some wine
[1:30:27] back when i was in the in the world we
[1:30:29] drank wine we drank beer they're
[1:30:31] nastiest things in the world
[1:30:32] they have a different flavor altogether
[1:30:34] they still have the same effect
[1:30:36] one takes longer you can just take all
[1:30:39] that doctrine you won't you can take all
[1:30:41] that teaching you want let me tell you
[1:30:42] you start drinking other real heavy
[1:30:43] stuff
[1:30:44] that holy ghost comes down through that
[1:30:45] anointing preaching it'll do something
[1:30:47] for you right quick
[1:30:48] you'll lay over here you'll be drunk
[1:30:49] laughing in the spirit
[1:30:51] because why because you've become under
[1:30:53] that that intoxication
[1:30:55] of that strong drink you know moses
[1:30:58] we know the story of moses the bible
[1:31:00] tell us in exodus 3 that the angel lord
[1:31:02] appeared on him in the flame of fire
[1:31:04] out of the midst of a bush think about
[1:31:06] that one
[1:31:08] what if he was hurting sheep out there
[1:31:10] in the wilderness
[1:31:11] all along you and a bunch of sheep
[1:31:13] blatant around the mountain
[1:31:15] and you go and you see this bush and
[1:31:17] this bush is on fire
[1:31:19] and this bush ain't putting out a bit of
[1:31:21] smoke it's just blazing
[1:31:24] brother danny said that moses's attitude
[1:31:27] toward the burning bush determine his
[1:31:30] destination
[1:31:32] and your attitude toward these services
[1:31:35] toward the outpouring of the holy spirit
[1:31:38] will determine your eternal destination
[1:31:40] your attitude mom dad grandparent
[1:31:46] see moses said i will turn aside and i
[1:31:49] will see this great sight while the bush
[1:31:50] not burn
[1:31:51] so let me just say this tonight he not
[1:31:54] only
[1:31:56] god was not only the god of abraham
[1:31:57] isaac and jacob but he was moses's god
[1:32:00] too
[1:32:01] and he's not only the god of abraham
[1:32:03] isaac and jacob and moses
[1:32:04] william branham and all these other
[1:32:06] messengers came before them
[1:32:08] he's your god the same god
[1:32:11] the same power the same signs the same
[1:32:14] wonders
[1:32:14] the same anointing see brother will say
[1:32:17] this he said now
[1:32:18] there was a time when a man had to be
[1:32:20] trained in all his wisdom and all the
[1:32:21] theology of
[1:32:22] the word of god and he know that by
[1:32:24] letter he'd been schooled
[1:32:25] he had all the degrees he was smart
[1:32:26] until the until he could teach the
[1:32:28] egyptian scholars and their teachers
[1:32:30] he knowed all about it by letter but a
[1:32:32] coward with it
[1:32:34] he knew it all in his mind but he was a
[1:32:38] coward with it
[1:32:39] he was running and he went out on the
[1:32:40] backside of a desert herding sheep for a
[1:32:42] stranger
[1:32:43] but there come a time that when he when
[1:32:46] god met him there in the burning bush
[1:32:48] and from that time moses was changed
[1:32:53] see from that time moses was changed and
[1:32:56] you know he he tried to do it all in
[1:32:58] himself without an experience
[1:33:00] and anytime you try to do it with
[1:33:01] yourself and without the anointing of
[1:33:03] the holy ghost or without the real
[1:33:04] experience
[1:33:05] of the baptism of the spirit of god
[1:33:07] you're just going to fail
[1:33:10] teaching is all right the prophet of god
[1:33:12] said but the letter killeth the spirit
[1:33:13] gives life
[1:33:14] say in the presence of that burning bush
[1:33:16] he know more about god in five minutes
[1:33:18] than he'd been taught in 40 years
[1:33:20] so what are you saying brother john said
[1:33:22] i'd rather have a five-minute encounter
[1:33:24] with the burning bush than all the years
[1:33:26] all the education
[1:33:27] all the theological discussions of the
[1:33:29] message of the doctrines of the
[1:33:31] the seals of the the church ages of all
[1:33:33] the mission you give me five minutes
[1:33:35] alone
[1:33:36] with the angel of the lord it's more
[1:33:37] than all the doctrine you can lay before
[1:33:39] me
[1:33:39] because the letter killed it but the
[1:33:41] spirit of god is the one that's here to
[1:33:43] give life
[1:33:44] he can anoint those mysteries anoint
[1:33:46] those shields and anoint those church
[1:33:47] ages and anoint the word of god so it
[1:33:49] not only just lays on the page
[1:33:51] but it becomes a living reality
[1:33:54] when the word becomes real and you take
[1:33:56] it into your bosom
[1:33:58] and you become the word of god
[1:34:02] five minutes five minutes is all you
[1:34:05] need tonight
[1:34:07] in that presence five minutes
[1:34:10] see moses had a supernatural experience
[1:34:13] in order to be a prophet he had to in
[1:34:15] order to be the bride you have to as
[1:34:17] well
[1:34:19] see we got to be going born again can i
[1:34:21] go just a little bit further
[1:34:22] we'll bring this i won't hold you much
[1:34:24] longer but i'm saying the
[1:34:26] the message this day the scripture is
[1:34:27] the field he says i talked to my nephew
[1:34:29] a while ago a little catholic boy
[1:34:31] that's an uncle bill i've been running
[1:34:33] from pillar to post going everywhere
[1:34:35] trying to find something night after
[1:34:37] night before this meeting started
[1:34:38] he'd been crying and out at nighttime
[1:34:40] he'd been dreaming dreams
[1:34:42] of coming in and running up to the altar
[1:34:44] we're preaching and
[1:34:45] making a confession that he's been wrong
[1:34:47] i said melvin
[1:34:48] no matter where you try to go how many
[1:34:51] churches you join
[1:34:52] how many hail marys you say or how many
[1:34:55] blessings you get from man
[1:34:56] you've got to be born again of the
[1:34:58] spirit of god it's the only thing
[1:35:00] that'll satisfy the human heart
[1:35:04] he says now i know they got a substitute
[1:35:07] today
[1:35:07] being born again shake hands with the
[1:35:09] preacher put your name on the book be
[1:35:11] friend that you know that is a dogma
[1:35:13] that's not the bible truth
[1:35:15] he says now when the day of pentecost
[1:35:16] fully come the pastor walked out
[1:35:18] and shook hands with the people
[1:35:21] that ain't what we do it even like
[1:35:22] tabernacle
[1:35:24] but when the day of pentecost was had
[1:35:26] fully come at the inauguration
[1:35:28] of the church there came a sound from
[1:35:29] heaven like a rushing mighty wind
[1:35:31] and it filled the house where they were
[1:35:32] sitting that's how the holy spirit comes
[1:35:35] the first time
[1:35:36] that's how it comes every time that's
[1:35:37] how it comes since that time
[1:35:39] he is god and he changes not
[1:35:44] see it was an experience he just didn't
[1:35:47] have a letter to read or lost read or
[1:35:49] books to read
[1:35:50] he had an experience that god still
[1:35:53] lived
[1:35:54] that's what we want for you
[1:35:57] not just a letter not just an idea not
[1:36:00] just a theology
[1:36:01] not just a doctrine but a reality
[1:36:05] that he lives that he lives
[1:36:09] you know i i made a comment i actually
[1:36:11] put it down here and i probably got to
[1:36:13] it i don't know if i may have skipped
[1:36:14] over
[1:36:15] i'll make this comment to you tonight
[1:36:16] you got to get to the point if you had
[1:36:18] to go to hell and you was a last man
[1:36:20] standing
[1:36:21] but you met god he's going to deliver
[1:36:23] you from hell
[1:36:26] if you went to hell and you met god and
[1:36:29] god changed now we know that can't
[1:36:30] happen but i'm just being hypothetical
[1:36:32] because sometimes that's how we feel all
[1:36:34] alone we feel like our life is in a
[1:36:36] living hell we've got trials on this
[1:36:38] side and trials on that side
[1:36:39] but you get to the place where you met
[1:36:41] god and you're standing all alone
[1:36:43] in the midst of all the adversity that
[1:36:44] could be around you but yet you got an
[1:36:46] anchor of faith
[1:36:47] because you had an experience where you
[1:36:49] met god and you know god will deliver
[1:36:52] you
[1:36:52] and you just sit there waiting if it
[1:36:54] ain't today god i'm gonna be waiting
[1:36:56] tomorrow
[1:36:57] if it's not tomorrow god i'm gonna come
[1:36:59] the next service and the next service
[1:37:01] and the next service i'm gonna come with
[1:37:02] an expectation
[1:37:04] because i have met god and i'm ready for
[1:37:06] the holy ghost and i'm ready for my
[1:37:08] deliverance and i'm ready for my healing
[1:37:10] and i am ready to light god
[1:37:12] because why because i have made god and
[1:37:15] i can point that devil
[1:37:17] back to a time where it all changed in a
[1:37:20] service
[1:37:20] where it all changed in the service
[1:37:22] where i was born again
[1:37:24] in a sermon where i received the holy
[1:37:26] ghost
[1:37:31] it's backside of the desert experience
[1:37:34] and when you have that
[1:37:35] all the devils out of hell can't talk
[1:37:37] you out of it
[1:37:39] you met god and until you meet god
[1:37:43] you'll be like that young girl that i
[1:37:45] spoke of earlier
[1:37:48] you got to have an experience but i said
[1:37:50] what we need today is somebody
[1:37:52] to meet god face to face talk to the
[1:37:54] situation
[1:37:56] and when you meet god things are changed
[1:37:58] certainly that's the only way
[1:38:00] we can have things moses was a coward
[1:38:04] running from the issue but after he met
[1:38:08] god
[1:38:09] he went marching with a stick in his
[1:38:12] hand
[1:38:13] a baby on a donkey and a wife going to
[1:38:16] take over
[1:38:18] what a difference what a difference
[1:38:21] the experience makes so moses when he
[1:38:25] got down to pharaoh
[1:38:26] i want you to notice he didn't bow his
[1:38:28] knee to pharaoh mr
[1:38:30] pharaoh could you please let my people
[1:38:34] go
[1:38:37] no i think them i can see moses kind of
[1:38:40] being kind of like me a little bit
[1:38:42] loud passionate he stuttered i do a
[1:38:44] little bit of that too
[1:38:45] so we're in good company moses went down
[1:38:49] there
[1:38:50] he stood flat-footed look here pharaoh
[1:38:53] i know who you are i know your position
[1:38:57] but i ain't afraid of you
[1:39:01] moses you let my people go
[1:39:04] you let them young people go you let
[1:39:07] them old people go
[1:39:08] you've held them by fear you've held
[1:39:09] them by depression you hit them by
[1:39:11] anxiety you heard them by sickness
[1:39:13] but today moses i'm telling you let them
[1:39:14] go
[1:39:16] how can moses stand before them because
[1:39:18] moses had bent his knees
[1:39:19] in the presence of the angel at the
[1:39:21] burning bush
[1:39:22] and he had had an experience that god is
[1:39:24] real
[1:39:26] and when you have that same experience
[1:39:28] church i don't care what you face
[1:39:30] you'll fear no enemy
[1:39:34] you'll fear no opposition because a god
[1:39:38] we
[1:39:38] serve will turn the devil's plans to not
[1:39:41] and you can look back on it and say come
[1:39:44] on it's time to get back to the wall
[1:39:46] we got to finish this thing up and wrap
[1:39:48] it up for a rapture so we can get out of
[1:39:50] here
[1:39:53] see the burning bush had what moses
[1:39:56] lacked
[1:39:58] and it has what you lack tonight as well
[1:40:01] let me tell a few testimonies can i go
[1:40:02] with a few testimonies as we bring this
[1:40:04] to a close
[1:40:05] i could go on and on and on but it's not
[1:40:07] sunday and
[1:40:08] we're tired but it's good to be in his
[1:40:11] presence
[1:40:13] you know mary magdalene she was put out
[1:40:15] on the street living as a prostitute her
[1:40:17] life was ruined and in ruins
[1:40:21] but one day she met jesus
[1:40:25] she had demons of lust depression
[1:40:27] anxiety fear suicide
[1:40:29] and all together seven demons
[1:40:33] she had a past but her past didn't have
[1:40:36] her
[1:40:39] so she had a past and each of us here
[1:40:41] this evening
[1:40:42] we have a past some not so good but i
[1:40:45] want you to know church
[1:40:46] your past doesn't have you because why
[1:40:50] because you met the angels
[1:40:54] amen had a young sister come in this
[1:40:56] prayer line
[1:40:57] brother danny and i brother danny and i
[1:41:00] stood right there and began to pray with
[1:41:01] her it was
[1:41:01] i think it was saturday night like all
[1:41:03] of it just kind of runs together i've
[1:41:04] been in a lot of prayer lines here
[1:41:05] lately but
[1:41:06] we began to pray just as she came up she
[1:41:08] confessed what was going on and
[1:41:10] me and brother danny began to pray and
[1:41:11] we'll begin to pray that things just
[1:41:12] pulled back like that and fell to the
[1:41:14] ground and
[1:41:15] i knew instantaneously what it was this
[1:41:18] is not my first rodeo
[1:41:19] i've seen this before because any time
[1:41:21] you begin to pray with somebody and that
[1:41:23] demonic spirit is there
[1:41:24] the first thing it does is pulls away
[1:41:26] and runs from it
[1:41:27] because he said he knows he's about to
[1:41:29] be cast out
[1:41:30] she pulled back and hit the ground and i
[1:41:32] began to come down when i began to come
[1:41:34] down to go pray for
[1:41:35] she rose up and that spirit spoke out of
[1:41:37] her leave
[1:41:38] me alone let me just go ahead and tell
[1:41:41] you i didn't read some
[1:41:43] casting out devil book for dummies
[1:41:46] no sir i knew my position i've had an
[1:41:49] experience with god
[1:41:51] not only that but we had an experience
[1:41:53] at camp we had dealt with devils before
[1:41:55] but i had met god and god had anointed
[1:41:58] me to cast that thing
[1:42:00] out and i began to curse that devil and
[1:42:02] that thing left her let me tell you
[1:42:04] that's when you gotta know let me you
[1:42:05] don't come into a prayer line and just
[1:42:07] think you're gonna play church
[1:42:09] or play preacher because that thing will
[1:42:12] jump off on them and jump on you
[1:42:14] you got to know where you stand you got
[1:42:16] to know that you had met
[1:42:17] god
[1:42:22] you got to know that you had met god
[1:42:24] there was another young sister come in a
[1:42:26] prayer line
[1:42:26] she was actually in a prayer line in
[1:42:28] oklahoma
[1:42:30] brother timothy preacher masterful
[1:42:31] service if y'all hadn't heard those
[1:42:32] services please
[1:42:33] by all means go back and listen to him
[1:42:35] wonderful and not only watch the service
[1:42:37] watch the anointing
[1:42:38] watch the movement of the spirit watch
[1:42:40] how everything just orchestrated
[1:42:42] this young girl came up and we began to
[1:42:45] pray it was one of the evenings brother
[1:42:46] timothy had preached
[1:42:47] and i stood over from the side looking
[1:42:50] and him and
[1:42:50] brother wendell was praying for some
[1:42:52] people and the grandmother this girl
[1:42:54] brought her up
[1:42:54] and i come over a little bit closer and
[1:42:56] i knelt down and i'm not knocked down i
[1:42:58] look down and i'm just watching
[1:43:00] kind of surveying just kind of
[1:43:01] understanding what's going on here
[1:43:03] what's the issue
[1:43:03] and something spoke to me said that's
[1:43:05] suicide
[1:43:07] well brother timothy came up before he
[1:43:09] came out his first words when he stepped
[1:43:11] out from behind the platform
[1:43:12] or behind the altar the pulpit that
[1:43:14] morning that evening he said now the
[1:43:15] lord just dealt very heavily we
[1:43:18] heavily with me in the back about a
[1:43:20] spirit of suicide did he not such a
[1:43:21] jessica
[1:43:22] he said lord just put it heavily on my
[1:43:24] heart to deal with suicide somebody's
[1:43:27] here that's got a suicidal spirit and i
[1:43:29] didn't think anything about it
[1:43:30] let me tell you i'm the farthest one
[1:43:32] that's being super spiritual
[1:43:33] but something said that's suicide and
[1:43:36] she's just shaking and going on
[1:43:38] and and i knew right there something
[1:43:39] ain't right this girl is not delivered
[1:43:42] and they just kind of moved her along
[1:43:43] well the service went on and on and on
[1:43:45] and on and
[1:43:46] and actually she come back up at another
[1:43:49] time
[1:43:50] he brought her back up and brother
[1:43:51] timothy and i were standing right to
[1:43:52] beside each other in a prayer line
[1:43:54] and i leaned over in his ear i said this
[1:43:56] is suicide right here
[1:43:58] this is the one you're looking for and
[1:44:01] brother timothy said you can ask him in
[1:44:03] his own words
[1:44:03] he said that's the one he waited for
[1:44:05] that night and when he got done praying
[1:44:07] for that one
[1:44:09] he left off the platform he was weakened
[1:44:13] and left off the platform and he come to
[1:44:15] me and says brother joe you were spot on
[1:44:16] that was the one i was looking for
[1:44:20] but that same girl the same girl came in
[1:44:23] our service
[1:44:24] mother and aaron not dealt with her
[1:44:26] right here
[1:44:28] suicidal spirit because of her past
[1:44:30] because of things that happened to her
[1:44:32] not her fault a lot of times it's things
[1:44:34] that are not our fault
[1:44:36] but the devil makes you think it's your
[1:44:37] fault you did this you created this
[1:44:39] mess no he created this mess
[1:44:44] but through his mess you're gonna rise
[1:44:46] up victorious
[1:44:48] we begin to pray for this girl she came
[1:44:50] up and she she confided in us told us
[1:44:52] i'm dealing with this thought i'm
[1:44:53] dealing with these these things this is
[1:44:55] what happened to me
[1:44:56] as a kid and or you know what happened
[1:44:58] to me and
[1:44:59] i don't know i just got ugly with it i'm
[1:45:01] thinking you know what you didn't
[1:45:02] torment this girl long enough
[1:45:04] and the spirit of god just began to flow
[1:45:06] out and we began to pray and brother
[1:45:07] aaron and i began to pray
[1:45:09] and she just began to pull back and just
[1:45:11] jump and shout and just
[1:45:13] beat her head against the pew right
[1:45:14] there
[1:45:16] you know that's how the devil does and
[1:45:18] if you're not wise to that
[1:45:20] first thing you do you may just let them
[1:45:21] say oh well we got the victory they
[1:45:23] shouted and jumped and jerked and all
[1:45:24] that
[1:45:24] and they screamed and you know they kind

[1:45:31] our hands on her
[1:45:32] and we began to speak peace to her and
[1:45:35] all of a sudden
[1:45:37] just the spirit of god just come over
[1:45:38] and you could just fence sense
[1:45:40] every muscle in her body just relaxed
[1:45:42] and she subsided

[1:48:24] fear has kept joshua butts bound
[1:48:28] over years after years after years after
[1:48:30] years
[1:48:33] keeping him from going to somebody's
[1:48:34] house his friend's house to enjoy a good
[1:48:36] fellowship
[1:48:37] because he's afraid to stay hope you
[1:48:38] don't mind this is just spontaneous
[1:48:40] hey he was scared to go to somebody's
[1:48:42] house to be away from his home away from
[1:48:44] his mom
[1:48:44] away from his his dad and his siblings
[1:48:47] and just away

[1:48:50] himself
[1:48:52] isn't that a tormenting spirit i'm more
[1:48:54] afraid of the woods than i am somebody
[1:48:56] else's house

[1:49:00] my head on i mean i'm scared to death
[1:49:02] i don't finally subside until i'm 20

[1:49:18] but i can't go to somebody else's house
[1:49:21] and brother aaron does such a masterful
[1:49:23] job dealing with that demon of fear

[1:49:47] has lost this grip for the spirit of
[1:49:50] fear can't hold you no more
[1:49:52] the spirit of fear is no longer the
[1:49:55] ruler
[1:49:56] of joshua butch but almighty god
[1:49:59] is your ruler and he's given you a
[1:50:01] spirit

[1:50:05] ghost
[1:50:06] where we fear not we stand boldly
[1:50:09] in the face of our enemy

[1:50:25] and to be free and he told me that the
[1:50:28] devil
[1:50:28] had been telling me that i had to do
[1:50:30] this and i had to do that
[1:50:32] to get the holy ghost which was very
[1:50:34] true
[1:50:35] and he prayed for me and when i go here
[1:50:37] and grab me
[1:50:41] uncle here and grab me you know it makes
[1:50:44] a difference when you're loved

[1:51:03] nobody believes you're gonna make it
[1:51:04] we're going to be there to help you make
[1:51:06] it
[1:51:08] brother uncle aaron grabbed me and
[1:51:09] pulled me to the side
[1:51:11] and was saying stuff that i don't
[1:51:12] remember all of it but
[1:51:14] but when he let me go i started
[1:51:16] stumbling around
[1:51:18] something took control of me and had my
[1:51:19] eyes closed the whole time but i
[1:51:21] remember
[1:51:22] like i was a puppet and i started
[1:51:24] jumping and my arms were going
[1:51:25] everywhere
[1:51:26] and i felt myself hit the handrail and i
[1:51:28] grabbed a hold and let myself dead
[1:51:30] on to the steps where i'd stay for
[1:51:32] probably 20 minutes just thanking the
[1:51:33] lord
[1:51:34] i was just amazed how the lord
[1:51:36] orchestrated it all and gave me my
[1:51:38] victory damn
[1:51:40] i'm still hungry for more so take this
[1:51:42] whole world
[1:51:44] forgive me jesus
[1:51:48] take this whole world say you can have
[1:51:51] laodicea
[1:51:52] you can have your women you can have
[1:51:54] your drugs you can have your alcohol
[1:51:56] you can have it all but give me jesus
[1:52:00] give me a reality give me an experience
[1:52:03] give me a holy goat give me a service
[1:52:05] like we had last week
[1:52:07] give me an outpouring of the holy ghost
[1:52:10] you can take it all but give me jesus
[1:52:13] but if you're gonna give me jesus
[1:52:15] make sure he's got signs and wonders
[1:52:16] when he's coming
[1:52:19] maddie join her i was watching all the
[1:52:22] young girls just dancing
[1:52:23] that's such a wonderful i'm not going to
[1:52:24] be able to get all these i'm just going
[1:52:25] to hit the highlights on a few
[1:52:27] i was watching all the young girls
[1:52:29] dancing have such a wonderful time
[1:52:31] and i wanted to experience that and i
[1:52:32] almost went up for prayer about it but
[1:52:34] the devil told me
[1:52:35] that you don't need to do that
[1:52:39] what are the people going to think about
[1:52:40] you and i just stood there and the devil
[1:52:42] said
[1:52:43] you don't even have the holy ghost how
[1:52:46] many has he ever told you that
[1:52:49] mom dad every day
[1:52:52] you ain't got it you're just playing you
[1:52:55] hypocrite
[1:52:56] going through the motions i say devil
[1:53:00] i tell you what you may be true it may
[1:53:02] look like i'm just going through the
[1:53:03] most
[1:53:04] but i can tell you one thing my heart's
[1:53:06] been turned
[1:53:08] deal with that one you bad cause you
[1:53:10] can't turn it back
[1:53:12] you upset because you done lost the
[1:53:13] victory i'm here to tell you i've been
[1:53:15] turned my desire to take
[1:53:16] i got the holy ghost you got the holy
[1:53:19] ghost
[1:53:20] why because anybody jumping in ain't
[1:53:22] about shout
[1:53:23] it's about having your desires changed
[1:53:25] when you know that you know
[1:53:27] the things that you used to quit the
[1:53:29] things that you used to desire
[1:53:30] you don't desire them no more now you
[1:53:32] desire the living word of god
[1:53:35] now you desire services like we're
[1:53:37] having tonight
[1:53:38] now you know the outpouring of the holy
[1:53:40] ghost
[1:53:45] then i stood there and the devil said
[1:53:46] you don't even have the holy ghost so i
[1:53:48] went up for prayer
[1:53:50] and i told you speaking to me she told
[1:53:51] brother joe that i don't know what i had
[1:53:53] just
[1:53:54] didn't feel like i you told me that that
[1:53:57] it's mine i just had to take it
[1:53:59] that he died so that i could live
[1:54:00] victorious so i did myself a little
[1:54:02] dance
[1:54:03] knowing that i am free and i had the
[1:54:06] holy ghost
[1:54:07] see that's the devil's life to keep you
[1:54:10] from it
[1:54:11] young people if you can ever realize
[1:54:14] that your desires are changed
[1:54:16] and when your desires are changed you
[1:54:18] may not point to a jump
[1:54:20] you may not can point to a shout or to
[1:54:23] laughing or to fallen out in a service
[1:54:25] but if you can point that devil back to
[1:54:27] where your desires were
[1:54:29] permanently changed there ain't no devil
[1:54:32] hear me
[1:54:33] no devil in hell can ever come and erase
[1:54:36] that experience from you
[1:54:38] let that be your assurance let that be
[1:54:40] your title
[1:54:41] let that be your driving force look back
[1:54:44] to that time
[1:54:45] that to some emotion cause i'm here to
[1:54:47] tell you when you get the holy ghost
[1:54:49] the emotion is going to come
[1:54:56] let me read this last one and i'll say
[1:54:59] the name for last okay
[1:55:05] so let me start out by saying this that
[1:55:08] this world has nothing
[1:55:10] that some people may bet this world is
[1:55:12] nothing that some people make it out to
[1:55:16] be
[1:55:18] let me start by saying this that this
[1:55:21] world
[1:55:22] is nothing that some people make it out
[1:55:25] to be
[1:55:30] nothing oh the devil paints you a pretty
[1:55:33] picture for a season
[1:55:35] what happens when the season's up what
[1:55:38] happened when your body is
[1:55:40] ravished in sin and aching and emphysema
[1:55:42] and
[1:55:43] you got cirrhosis of the liver what
[1:55:45] happens then
[1:55:46] well he painted you a picture for a
[1:55:48] season but this world is nothing
[1:55:51] being in the world was one of the most
[1:55:52] difficult things for me
[1:55:54] i was depressed all day
[1:55:57] every day
[1:56:02] i was never truly happy i faked a smile
[1:56:05] every day i was to the point that i
[1:56:07] wanted
[1:56:08] to end it all
[1:56:14] i tell you what it's a low place
[1:56:18] it's a low place been there done that
[1:56:23] got the victory i'm testimony to you
[1:56:27] tonight church
[1:56:28] been there done that in that moment
[1:56:32] depressed all day every day
[1:56:35] but i can point that devil back to a
[1:56:37] time that i got the victory
[1:56:41] it all started when i got up the age and
[1:56:43] i realized that my dad was an alcoholic
[1:56:47] and how my brother my sister both left
[1:56:49] the message
[1:56:50] after we went through a bunch of stuff
[1:56:52] with my dad and i felt like i had no one
[1:56:54] to talk to
[1:56:55] whenever i was going through a bunch of
[1:56:56] family stuff
[1:56:59] but at family camp one year i went up
[1:57:00] for prayer and i felt like i got a
[1:57:02] victory
[1:57:03] within every but whenever i went home
[1:57:06] the devil went right back to messing
[1:57:07] with my mind and my head telling me that
[1:57:10] i wasn't saved he was telling me that
[1:57:12] you had to excuse me a minute
[1:57:17] he was telling me that all my worldly
[1:57:19] friends were going to call me crazy
[1:57:21] because of the difference that i was
[1:57:23] trying to make and so i went right back
[1:57:25] to doing all the things that i had been
[1:57:27] doing
[1:57:29] so peer pressure is tough
[1:57:32] mom and dad you may not remember it but
[1:57:35] it's real for your young people
[1:57:38] it's a spirit and it's a spirit of
[1:57:40] oppression
[1:57:43] it goes on to say i've done a lot of
[1:57:45] things that i'm ashamed of and even now
[1:57:46] the devil keeps throwing that in my face
[1:57:49] let me just stop right here and say this
[1:57:52] you may have a past
[1:57:54] but your past don't have you
[1:57:57] i feel like dancing right now
[1:58:02] i've done a lot of things that i'm
[1:58:03] ashamed of and even now the devil keeps
[1:58:05] throwing that in my face
[1:58:06] and it keeps telling me how are you
[1:58:08] going to explain the difference
[1:58:09] in yourself to your school people and
[1:58:11] your friends
[1:58:13] but i'm ignoring that lie casting down
[1:58:16] imagination
[1:58:17] and every high thing that exalts itself
[1:58:19] against the knowledge of god
[1:58:21] so on saturday night when everything was
[1:58:23] going on and they started singing and i
[1:58:24] was crying because
[1:58:25] i wanted the holy ghost so bad
[1:58:29] so i whispered to them to my friend that
[1:58:31] i want the holy ghost but i felt like i
[1:58:32] couldn't get it because
[1:58:34] of what the devil's been telling me so
[1:58:35] finally i got out of my seat
[1:58:37] i went out front to get
[1:58:41] excuse me let me read this again i went
[1:58:42] out i finally got out of my seat i went
[1:58:43] front to get prayed for
[1:58:45] and i told brother joe that i wanted the
[1:58:46] holy ghost but the devil keeps telling
[1:58:48] me
[1:58:49] that i can't get it but once i got up
[1:58:52] there
[1:58:53] i felt the spirit of the lord like i've
[1:58:55] never felt it before
[1:58:57] and he started praying for me and i just
[1:58:59] started dancing and then i fell to the
[1:59:01] ground
[1:59:02] and uncle aaron
[1:59:05] i'll tell you what a team what a team

[2:00:15] when when he came back i was on the
[2:00:17] ground

[2:00:19] telling me that i was a daughter of god
[2:00:21] and then i got up and i took off running
