Are you here to magnify the Lord &gt;&gt; and bless the Lord no matter what the day looks like? Amen. Let's go to him together in prayer, Brother Johnny, and take these knees before the Lord. If you have a need you just want to lift to him. Amen. [Music] Let us bow to him. Father, in the name of Jesus, this evening we come before your presence &gt;&gt; only with one thing in mind, oh Lord Jesus, that is to praise you, Lord. That is to worship you, oh Lord. That is to lift up your holy name. Lord, we thank you, Father God, for your goodness, your grace, your mercy, for your loving kindness, for everything, oh Lord God, that you are doing for us, oh Lord, what you have done, Lord God, what you are doing and what you are going to do, Lord. We know, Lord God, by time, oh Lord, in prophecy that things, oh Lord God, are coming to a head, oh Lord, if I can say it that way. But Lord, we know that you made a promise, oh Lord God, that we would be with you, oh Lord, eternally. So Lord, we are resting on that, Lord Jesus. Our hope, oh Lord God, is in that. Our faith, oh Lord God, is ready to receive, oh Lord God, of your all the promises of which you have made us, oh Lord. But Lord, tonight, oh Lord God, we want to just remember those that have requests, oh Lord Jesus. Lord, those, oh Lord God, that are in need, Lord Jesus. Our brother Tom, oh Lord, and sister, brother Stany, Lord God, that have need. And all of the other requests, oh Lord God, that was mentioned across this pull pit, Lord S. I don't know, Lord God, personally, but Lord, you know them, oh Lord Jesus, you know all about it. Oh Lord God, you knew it, oh Lord God, before the foundation of the world. And nothing, oh Lord God, has surprised you, Lord. So with that thought, oh Lord God, and with by that word, oh Lord God, we are here this evening, oh Lord, to receive, oh Lord God, of what we have a desire of, oh Lord, knowing that you, oh Lord God, is going to take care of it, oh Lord, knowing that you are going to fix it, oh Lord God, knowing that you are God that supplies all of our needs according to your riches and glory. So Lord, this evening, oh Lord God, as we gathered here, Lord, Lord, we are as bride, as the bride of Jesus Christ, we take authority, Lord God, over every devil, every demon, oh Lord God, that would hinder your will from being performed tonight, Lord God, from the word, oh Lord God, that is coming forth, oh Lord. Lord, we bind those devils, oh Lord, and we cast them from before our presence, Lord. Speak a word tonight, Lord Jesus. Lord, speak a word tonight, Lord God, that would stir us up, oh Lord God, in the in the inner man, that would give us greater faith, oh Lord God, that would lift us up a little bit higher, Lord, that we may, oh Lord God, praise you, Lord, that we may glorify you, Lord. Help us to step aside, oh Lord God, this evening, oh Lord God, and receive, oh Lord God, of what you have in store for us, Lord. Anoint us from on high, Lord Jesus. Anoint the word, oh Lord God, that it may come forth with power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost, oh Lord. Lord, we are looking forward to that, oh Lord. Lord, we are looking forward to it, oh Lord. And we are trusted in you, Lord God, that you are going to do something tonight as you, oh Lord, have never done before, Lord God. For we know that we serve a God of increase. We know that we serve a God that that, oh Lord God, doesn't do the same thing, oh Lord God. Oh Lord, in each and every service, oh Lord, but do according to your will, oh Lord, according to your will, oh Lord, in the name of Jesus, oh Lord, Lord, you tell us in your words to call on you, to call on you, Lord God, and you would come and s with us, oh Lord, we are calling on you tonight, Lord, to move amongst us, oh Lord God, to move amongst us, oh Lord God.

This is only for a moment. [Applause] Hallelujah. Amen. Let's all stand together. Amen. When every mountain seems to high. When every river looks too wild, when my ship is lost as sea. Oh, that's when Jesus rescues me. [Music] My faith is strong and carries me. Though sometimes weak, I still beef. Oh, my life is built on this desire. Through the flooding. Oh Jesus rescues me. Oh, and every mountain looks too high. And every river looks too wide. When my ship is lost at sea, oh Jesus. Oh, if his eyes on the sparrow, he's watching. My faith is strong. and he carries me. Though sometimes weak, I still be. Oh, life is built on this desire. Through the flooding, oh Jesus. Oh, city. Life is built. Life is built on this desire. Through the flood and through the fire. Oh Jesus, see it again. Life is built. Oh, life is built on this design through the flooding. Oh Jesus rescues me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many's thankful Jesus rescued you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm thankful there's no situation that's too hard for him to handle with. Whether it's the flood or the fire or whatever you find yourself found yourself in, he came by your way and rescued you. What a mighty God we serve. Amen. Let's just go to him in prayer. Father, we just come to you today, Lord, asking, Father, once again, that you come and speak to our hearts and lives, Lord, by your word. And Lord, that you just come and minister, Lord, as only you can do. We commit this service to you. Everything be said and done for your glory and for your honor. Lord, we just believe, Lord, that you're here among us, Lord, to minister, to touch, to heal, deliver, Father, to come and break the bread of life to us. we pray. We commit this service to you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Let's look to Isaiah chapter 28 and verse 16. Amen. Speaking of Isaiah, we have brother Isaiah here and sister Julie and their family from Belgium. Very thankful to have them with us. And Amen. and they just have a wonderful time here while they're taking a little vacation, I believe, and and uh spending time with believers. That's a wonderful thing to do. Amen. Be in the presence of other believers and to worship God and to give God glory and honor. Just want to speak today on the faith and the foundation stone. It's reading here in Isaiah 28 and verse 16. says, "Therefore, thus saith the Lord God, behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone. It's a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation. And he that believeth shall not make haste." This haste is a interesting word. It means to be disturbed or agitated or become unstable. It's actually they put a picture beside this word in the Greek of a twisted rope that is tangled. So tangled that it's unusable. So he that believeth not will make haste, but he that shall believe shall not make haste. Amen. And you that believe in this stone, this foundation, you won't become disturbed or agitated or unstable or twisted all up, but you'll be sta steady in the things of God. Amen. God bless you and be seated. Um, just want to say we had a wonderful time while we were away at brother Ivan Cars this past weekend before. And and brother Ivan's a wonderful brother. Um he's almost 96 years old and and uh surprise just jump up and down do every run up and down steps. It's incredible. Uh he's got a son-in-law that helps him there. Brother Carmen Meals and really appreciated being with them. Had a wonderful time. Uh you know um I think we're having a communion and foot washing this weekend coming up and then a meal. uh brother brother Ivan Carr he uh said at the end of that service he said um he said now he said we're gonna have a potluck and um he said I want everyone to come that can and be of course be invited to stick around. He said now in our country what potluck means if you get the wrong pot you're lucky to live. Amen. We trust it ain't that way this weekend. Amen. But it's good to be able to be with them and to be back together with you and and to be able to worship the Lord and and to praise God and and to be together with God's people. Amen. There's no better people on the face of the earth than God's people. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm having trouble with Siri here. She's wanting to malfunction. Amen. But we're not worried about her this this evening. We're we're here for the word of God. But speaking on the foundation stone, um I also want to read there in Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 24 says, "And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel. See that thou refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escape not, who refuse him that spake on the earth, much more shall we not shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven, whose voice then shook the earth, but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more, I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. And this word yet once more signif. Wherefore we receive in a kingdom that cannot be moved. Let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire. So we we read here of two kingdoms. One that can be shaken and one that cannot be shaken. And this shaking is a is emotion that is you know or agitation or something that has caused you to caused to totter is to to shake thoroughly to shake the contents together to cast it down to agitate the mind to disturb. So all these words is what it's speaking about to move to and fro to shake to put into a state of waving and rocking and vibratory motion. And we know the world that we're living in is falling apart. I was just looking over that sermon brother Brandon would preach there in the 1960s of the world falling apart. And and to read what he said there is very much you see it even happening even more today in the time that we're living in. So we know that everything that can be shaken will be shaken. I I thought it was interesting as I was studying this. the earth was actually hit with one of the most powerful earthquakes has ever been recorded o on the earth and and and and in this whole world and I saw videos of different ones that were in buildings and things begin to move and to shake but that's a that's one thing but this this shaking that we're talking about is even greater than a earthly building shaking or or trees waving back and forth but it's a spiritual shaking it's a shaking that is taking place and we we see that This world is falling apart. We see polit politics are corrupt. There's no stable ground there. Governments are shaking. Uh there's no stable ground there. I mean, one person uh can make a a post on Twitter and it'll shake people and shake governments and shake stock markets and all kinds of things. But there's only one place to stand and that is on the foundation stone. Amen. That is the word of God, Jesus Christ. Now, Brother Brand will say it like this. He said, "The way that I have faith in God is first I have faith in his word." He said, "If any vision or any person or anything speaks anything contrary to the word of God, then I don't hear it." He said, "This is the fundamental foundation of all God has said to his church. And every person's faith must be built sovereignly upon the Bible." And and I'm very thankful that we have a message in this hour did not did that did not come. and a prophet who did not come to rewrite a Bible to, you know, to as Joseph Smith would. He would write for another Bible for the Mormon church. I I spent some time with a young man on an airplane speaking to him about that as he was going off on one of his mission trips, and he wanted to offer me his Bible. And I said, you know, I also believe in a prophet. I I believe God sent a prophet in this day, but the prophet, I believe, didn't have to write a new Bible, but he made this Bible live. And and I believe that this word of God is strong. It's something that we can stand upon, that we can anchor our faith to. Amen. That we can anchor our our life to. He says when I read here in his word, it'll never change. I it'll never pass away. It's eternally right. Mine may fail because I'm just a man. My words may fail. I may speak like another man, make mistakes or anything, but when he speak, mark his words. It is the truth. Amen. It is true. This is his word primarily. This is the foundation. And he said, "Every church, every bornagain person is built upon this foundation, Jesus Christ, the chief's cornerstone." And he is the gate, the door of the entrance to all eternal blessings. He is the gate, the door of the sheepfold. But this Bible is his word. And if a man or a woman or whoever speaks anything to be the truth that's contrary to the contents of this Bible, it is wrong. &gt;&gt; It is wrong. That's right. It's absolutely wrong. He said, "But if a man speaks and it's backed by the Bible, then it's the truth." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I'm thankful that we have a a message that we can say that. Amen. It's backed by the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's backed by the Bible. I I remember a testimony and I I don't remember all the details, but I remember this part of brother Danny speaking about a woman, Danny Steam, speaking about a woman that came to his church and got real agitated in the service and walked off the grounds and he followed her. if you remember that story and and he began to talk to her and she's like and he began to talk to her about the scriptures and he wasn't necessarily saying where it was coming from but just began to quote the scriptures to her and he said she said oh you just get all that from William Brandom he said you know you just paid him the highest compliment you could ever pay him he said because everything that I've said came straight from the word of God amen this word that we believe is not something outside the Bible it's inside the Bible it's this message that we believe is not something outside the word of God. This word is the foundation that we can stand upon. &gt;&gt; Now, I believe that every Bible teaching and every church and every revelation, listen, everything must be built on the word. If anybody teaches anything contrary to the word, I'm not going to believe it. This Bible is God's foundation. &gt;&gt; This Bible is God's foundation. No other foundation can be laid, but it's already been laid. Christ Jesus the word. &gt;&gt; But we know Jesus is the only safe and secure foundation that anything can be built on. You you can built you can build your life upon your your your past uh uh uh uh uh accomplishments. You can build your life, Amen, upon uh your family or things, but all of that can crumble around you. But if you'll build a life that's based upon Jesus Christ, it'll stand firm through the through the h the winds of hell and through the doubts and through the unbeliefs and through the worries. Amen. It's a firm foundation. It's the only foundation that you can really build on. All other foundations are sinking sands. All other foundations are sinking sands. On Christ the solid rock I stand. All other foundations, all other grounds sinking sand. Lots of people, he says, build upon riches. You know, they they they try to make that work and see how much money they can make and they say, "Well, if I can't spend it, my children can behind me." But what does it do? He said, "It leads to slavery. They they become a slave to money. Many people don't have to be." He said, "Many people don't have to be millionaires to be that. You can just covet money and you're just as guilty as a millionaire." &gt;&gt; Wow. He said, "There's just as many pennys than there will be millionaires in hell." All right. &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen. He said, "What is it?" It's because your attitudes towards it and what you are building upon. Amen. If you're building and that is your God and and that is all you desire and you built upon and you're building upon that, it will fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said another thing, you know, in this America that we live in that they've tried to build on the foundation of popularity. you know, young girls or young boys and and television stars and movie stars, you know, try to act like them, dress like them, impersonate them. What does it do? It leads to a ruined life of chaos. It's stubbles of hay that's going to be burnt at the judgment. Amen. Jesus is the only foundation. It is the only sure foundation. That's the reason we could come should come to him. Nobody else has that foundation. Riches doesn't have it. popularity doesn't have it. Nobody has it. Only Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You know, many of us, you know, he said many, many build upon education. You know, he said school is all right in its place, but it'll never take the place of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, listen, brother Brandon brings us some balance because a lot of people think he was against education, but he wasn't really. He just wanted it in his place. He said, "Now we can't," he said, "we can't even hardly get teachers no more. teenagers so rough till people won't even want to don't even want to teach them. Little Oswall and Les and all them. They run the teacher out of the building. They set up protests. They'll strike. They'll close up school. Man, sound like he's living in our day, doesn't it? I thought that was the good old days. Said, "I wouldn't want to be a school teacher either. I'd just get out of it." He said, "But we're talking about education." He said, "Education, that's all right. We don't want a bunch of illiteracy. We don't want a bunch of illiteracy but we want education in this place. He said but the trouble of it is today we try to educate our pull pits and when we do we took the way out. Christ is the foundation. Education is all right but listen many times listen to this. Education leads to the demon of education. And that demon of education leads you to be a know-it-all. &gt;&gt; Uhoh. And when you get there, you become an infidel and you deny Christ. &gt;&gt; So this is where he said we don't we're not pro to promote illiteracy. That's not what we want. But we want it in its place. Our foundation is not upon education. It's upon Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, a good education, a diploma do you well in this life. Amen. Many of many of you got diplomas on your wall and has done you well, but it will not get you to the other side. All right. &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that'll get you to the other side, and that's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Neither can we build it, he said, upon political powers. Well, I, you know, well, I'm a Democrat. I'm a Republican. He said, both parties are rotten. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. There's only one foundation built upon Christ. This nation don't need to rely upon any other foundation, but Jesus Christ. No other foundation is laid. No other foundation you can get to heaven on. No other foundation is secure but a foundation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He speaks about a building that he saw one time in New York. So I was riding along with a minister friend of mine and he said, "Oh, it's a great beautiful building." He said, "I I looked there and it's probably 50 stories, maybe 60 mammoth, big place, beautiful, all intricate details and stuff, but I there's no one in there." I said, "Well, what's wrong? There's nobody in the building. what's the matter? He said, 'He give me the estimation of what that building cost and the millions to build that building. I said, 'Well, why don't they let somebody move into it? He said, as soon as the building was almost completed, all the outside polished and everything, they come to find out that the foundation wasn't right. It had been laid upon some kind of soap stone and not real stone. &gt;&gt; He said, "Therefore, the building was condemned." And said, "It only serves as one thing. It served for that contractor to climb up to the top and to jump off and commit suicide. &gt;&gt; He said, "No matter how good the outside looks, &gt;&gt; there's all not another foundation that's sure, but the foundation of Jesus Christ, he is the real foundation to be built on." And you, you know, I thought about that in this context of this quote as we built this church. We took core samples of this soil and we found out this soil had a lot of movement in it. And so the the engineers would design a lot of concrete and a lot of a lot of tension lines and a lot of a lot of things, a waffle slab, all kinds of stuff. Why? Because you got to get the foundation right. Because you can just go out, well, I'm going to put it out here and pour a bunch of concrete, build up a nice, beautiful building, and next few years that thing will be all crumbled apart or lean way over and condemned. Why? Because the foundation wasn't right. And this is where brother Brandon was ministering on and trying to put his emphasis on. Was Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever? He didn't come to build a new foundation. He said the foundation is already here. It's Jesus Christ. We just got to bring and build our building upon this foundation. &gt;&gt; This is the word Job. And they're speaking of the word haste at the beginning. Job said, "Therefore, my thoughts cause me to answer and for this I make haste again, you know, because his found he said he got he was looking and searching for his foundation." He was looking to see where he because he was in a storm. We know Job's story. He was in a big storm and and against a a lot of winds were blowing and a lot of people were saying things and he said, "But if I listen to my own self and I try to build it on my own self, on my own thoughts, then I make haste. Then I become a twisted rope. Then I become tangled and unusable. &gt;&gt; This is what he this is what Jesus was saying in Matthew chapter 7 and verse 24 when he said therefore whosoever heareth the sayings of mine and doeth them. I will liken them unto a wise man which build his house upon a rock. And the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and it beat against that house and fell not for it was founded upon a rock. He was founded upon a rock. And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which build his house upon a sand. And the rains descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it. Now notice the difference. One, the difference was two different foundations. But also, there was another difference. The war because but there was a lot of similarities. The wise and the foolish both get rain. They both got floods. They both got winds. They both heard the sayings. But only one did them. &gt;&gt; Because he said, "Not only heareth my words, but doeth them." &gt;&gt; All right. This is what puts you on the right foundation. &gt;&gt; Is you're not just hearing the word, but you're doing it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, people can come and hear the word and jump up and down, shout hallelujah and amen louder than anybody else and go out there and live like the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? And it shows their house is not built upon a rock. &gt;&gt; But if your house is on the right foundation, you don't just hear the word, but you do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. The li the word is not just heard, but the word is lived. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what James chapter 1 and verse 22 says. Prove yourselves doers of the word, actively and continually obeying God's precepts and not merely listeners. &gt;&gt; Not merely listeners who hear the word but fail to internalize its meaning, deluding yourselves by unsound reasoning contrary to the truth. For if anyone only listens to the word without obeying it, he's like a man who looks very carefully at his natural face in a mirror. For once he's looked at himself and gone away, he immediately forgets what he looked like. I love how the Living P the Passion translation put it. He said, "I if if one just listens, they come to the house of God and they see what God says about them, but they go right out there and they forget all about it. and they're blown away and they're shaken and they're moved and and this comes and that comes and and and instead of relying on their foundation, they start relying on their thoughts. &gt;&gt; And this is where Job was trying to warn you. If you do this, you're going to make haste. You're going to become tangled up. You're going to become mangled. You're going to become unstable. Amen. That's where the scripture also says the double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways. Because there's two minds at work. There's your mind and there's Christ's mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. We want the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Cuz the mind of Christ does not change. No matter the storm, no matter the sickness, no matter the sorrow, no matter the problems, no matter the situation, your mind might change. Your mind to go up, your mind will go down. But the mind of Jesus Christ will stay there stabilizing you during those times. But if he looks, but he who looks carefully under the perfect law, the law of liberty, and faithfully abides by it, not becoming a careless listener who forgets, but an active doer who obeys, he will be blessed and favored in God in what he does, his life, and his life of obedience. But the world we see is shaking. Kingdoms of this world are crumbling. the whole earth. All nature is grown in him. &gt;&gt; All nature is grown in you. We must be on a firm foundation if we're going to remain. &gt;&gt; That foundation can only be Christ. There's only one place you can walk on and get to from here to glory. That's on Jesus Christ. That's only one place you can stand on. That is on Jesus Christ. He showed it very clearly in Jacob's uh uh Jacob's life as he would find a place. He was you know Jacob a wonder and you know yet he had a promise in his life. He'd been wandering out and got out and some things but he had a promise but he was really tired and he's running in the wilderness running from his brother and you know got a lot of thoughts no doubt was going through his mind and he he was all shook up &gt;&gt; and he finds a place to finally rest and he lays his head upon a rock. Ain't that interesting? a rock for a pillow. How many want to go out there and choose a rock? But this rock wasn't just some ordinary rock. If you study this rock, it was actually the same rock that followed the children of Israel through the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Amen. This rock he laid his head upon. He said maybe he would got scared. He was nervous. And no wonder maybe he could hear gallop of horses hooves or something. Esau was coming. Jacob probably with his little spear to try to keep animals off running as hard as he could. Had a little ragged coat tearing through the wilderness. climbed up that great big hill and he looked off to see see if anybody was around. But in the evening the sun was going down and this poor little fellow was so tired he rolled over on this rock and laid down for some rest. And we know he had a dream and he dreamed of a ladder that went from him this rock up into heaven. &gt;&gt; And the and and and the way Jacob got but look at the way Jacob got it. He said God had made a promise and had to keep it. And the loins of Jacob laid the blessed righteous seed that had to come forth. So God had to make a way for it to come forth. Amen. So he was showing Jacob there is a way. There is a pathway that I have made. And so he took Jacob and he showed him some of the future knowing he was an heir to the promise. Not because he deserved it, but it was because God had promised it to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not because maybe you got it all right. Maybe not because you've done something right. Maybe you've done everything wrong. That wasn't I'm thankful he didn't choose it on my on whether I deserved it or not. He chose chose it because he chose it. Amen. He said the only way. He said what happened? He said he said he was an heir to a promise and he was an heir to all things. So God was showing him amen way a highway. He said it was he he said he said he said he was laying down and God shuts him off and and he gives him a vision. and he looks up and he sees a ladder fastened up into the heaven to God's throne, reaching all the way down the earth and angels ascending and descending upon this ladder up and down. And now all through the years we find that this is a beautiful promise laying here that God has promised a way of escape. He has promised a ladder we can climb on, a sure foundation. God has promised it and he's hooked it in glory to the throne of God. &gt;&gt; He said, but he needed a place on earth to hook it to. &gt;&gt; Amen. He couldn't hook it in Jacob. &gt;&gt; Jacob was a deceiver. &gt;&gt; He couldn't. He He He tried to hook it in Jacob, but he couldn't. He Jacob just go off and do his own thing. He was deceiver. He couldn't hook it in in Abraham. &gt;&gt; He said, Abraham, he couldn't hook in Abraham. He said he was backslid sometimes, shy sometime, treating his wife this way, couldn't hook it to that lying, couldn't hook it to that. &gt;&gt; He tried to hook it to David one time and he took Beth Sheeba and and had had a riot killed. Everything he tried to hook it to, it would not anchor. &gt;&gt; But the prophet said there' be a stone laid in Zion, &gt;&gt; a precious stone, a tried stone. Now, if you're going to try to build a bridge and you hook it to stone on one side, you want the equal amount of strength on the other side. &gt;&gt; You don't want to put it in some sand over there and hope for the best. No, you want it to anchor in the same abilities on both sides. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he said there there was a stone laid in Zion there. It would be an anchor. He said it's a wonderful stone. And he said a precious stone. And God being God in heaven, the ladder hooked to his own throne. He said he hooked it to none other but the son of Jesus, son of man, Jesus Christ, the chief st cornerstone. God didn't want this ladder slipping. &gt;&gt; He didn't want his children to get halfway across and one side give in and fall to the ground. &gt;&gt; No, but he anchored it in God. He put it around the heart of God and he sent himself down to earth so he could have an anchor point down here. a way of escape, &gt;&gt; a place that we can walk as the king's highway. God didn't want the ladder slip and he tried to hook it to Adam and it broke. &gt;&gt; But God made this covenant unconditionally and he hooked it to only one he could, Christ Jesus. There it anchored. There is no slipping there, no sliding there, no falling away there. What is it? It's hooked by God above and the son of God beneath. What is it? It's a pathway. It's a traveler's way from earth to glory. You can't fail. &gt;&gt; You can't fail. Look, there's a great companies of angels down there ascending and descending. They're picking up the weary. They're picking up the sick. Oh, glory to God. If you're downhearted today, there's an angel that's standing right by your side to pick you up and to carry you along this highway. Yes. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They're picking up the weary. They're picking up the sick. They're healing their bodies. They're showing visions, mighty signs and wonders. You cannot fail cuz it cannot slip. It cannot slide. We are saved. God said so. And that settles it forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's hooked around the heart of God and hooked around the son of God. We're brought into it through the son of God. We ascend to him. Then what are we scared about? &gt;&gt; If you're scared, it's because you're making haste. &gt;&gt; You're making haste. Getting all tangled up. Tore up. &gt;&gt; The song ain't tangled up, tore up. It's tangled up, wrapped up in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. We ascend to him. What are you scared about? Our promises is hooked between God and Christ and we are in between them. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; We are in between them. &gt;&gt; And we're and with angels. He said he would give his angels charge over thee. &gt;&gt; He's got angels stationed all along this highway. &gt;&gt; Amen. A God. Angels of God are encamped about those that fear him. All up and down. When we we're making up our way up this foundation, climbing higher and higher each day, it brings me up one more round higher, moving up up. Everything's happening. If I fall along the road or if something happens to me, there's a great host of angels standing right there to pick me up &gt;&gt; and say, "Come on, we're marching on up toward Zion, that beautiful city above. We cannot fail. &gt;&gt; There's no failing to it. It don't rest upon what I done or what I do. It rest upon what he's already done. &gt;&gt; It's already finished. The the believer once anchored in Christ Jesus come through that door is put on this highway and you can't get anywhere but straight up to God. When you rock this highway, &gt;&gt; angels are there to take care of you. Angels are there to feed you. Angels are there to nourish you. Oh my God. Amen. You might come in this service discouraged and all down your head hanging down. Don't do that. Amen. Won't you just look over a little bit? There's an angel standing there. He's got a piece of bread to give you. He's got the softest hands to rub your brow. Amen. This is what Elijah found himself on was that highway &gt;&gt; where angels could minister to him. when he seen in the beginning in our first parents fall, he seen the covenant he made with Adam. He tried to hook the ladder to him and it fell. Then there's nothing else he could hook it to but to bring it down to his own son and hook it to him. Now it can't fail. You know what that tells me? The rapture can't fail. &gt;&gt; You know what that tells me? These promises cannot fail. You know what that tells me? I cannot fail. &gt;&gt; You know what that tells me? You cannot fail. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen. Because we're not standing upon our own abilities, our own ideas, our own thoughts. You can't stand there. You'll get washed away. &gt;&gt; People have done it. They've tried on their own abilities and thoughts to try to explain God, try to explain everything. And they and then and all those doubts and confusion just washes the foundation right away to where they don't even believe in God no more. &gt;&gt; They made haste. &gt;&gt; They're nothing but a bunch of tangled up, useless rope, twisted, unusable. But our foundation stands sure. Foundation is God. God laid this Zion, this cornerstone. There we are. Can't slip, can't slide, can't move. Then we come into the door through Christ put on this highway. We may have our ups and downs. That's true enough. Sickness and troubles. Yes. But remember, there's a great company of angels all along the road to bear thee up any time. Taking you up when you fall. Oh yes, he's there. He promised it. He had to make it that way. &gt;&gt; The only way he could make it was the cornerstone, the precious stone, the tried stone. He didn't put it in something that was untried. But this stone came down and he was tried in every way, tempted in every way. And it proved on that day the inoculation held. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Precious stone, tried stone. That's why we can say in the word, the name of the Lord's a mighty tower, a strong tower, and the righteous run into it are safe. That's right. Safe. Nothing can bother you anymore. You're on the rock. You're in the rock. It's not whether you hold on, it's whether the rock holds on or not. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; That's why I can't hard to sing them songs. I just keep holding on. I ain't holding on. I can't hold on. &gt;&gt; If it was on my abilities to hold on, I'd have been washed away a long time ago. But that's not me that's holding. It's him that's holding. &gt;&gt; All along the road, something is done. testing you, trying you, your trials. But there's angels to bear you up, angels to comfort you, angels to give you faith, angels to move you along. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. On them days you don't feel like taking another step, there's an angel just kind of Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. Let's move on. We got to keep walking. &gt;&gt; Come on. You got another day. There's only a few days left, but just keep on coming. &gt;&gt; I got to thinking about this stairway and this highway. It's got only so many steps. &gt;&gt; There's only so many steps. And one day, we're going to step up on that last one. &gt;&gt; And we're going to step around and we're going to see where that other spot was anchored in God around the throne. And we're going to say, "Thank God for your grace. Thank God for your mercy. Thank God for your love. Thank God for choosing me when I was unchooable. Thank God for loving me when I was unlovable. Thank God for looking beyond my faults and seeing my needs in Jesus Christ and putting my feet up on a solid rock that I could stand. &gt;&gt; He had to make a way for this &gt;&gt; and he made it through Christ. There's no other way but through Christ. &gt;&gt; Every time that God made a promise, he had to make a way for the promise. He told Noah he was going to destroy the world. So he made Noah a way of escape. And Noah, you know, tell him to build it out of gopher wood. Gopher wood is real thin, light wood. It's lighter than balsom. How many ever made a one of them little balsom wood airplanes as a kid, you know, little ain't nothing to them. You just chunk them and they move around. Do flip. It's lighter than that. How in the world? Why in the world would God, you know, why? Wh why why how there's better woods? Got to be. But God wasn't dependent upon the bossom wood. It had to be a wood that could take the pitch. &gt;&gt; Pine has its own pitch. Oak has its own. This was But it had to have something that could soak up this pitch that God knew would hold through the flood. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Baptist, they might have their own pitch and this one got their own pitch. God is looking for some ghostwood. &gt;&gt; Somebody that can soak up the presence of God and the spirit of God can enter inside of them and not only hear the word but become doers of the word. And when the storms of life beat against the boat, they'll say the anchor holds. &gt;&gt; God takes his foolishness of things and makes a paradox. It's incredible but true. Said he got it ready to float and God said that's not all finished yet. You got to get some pitch and pour it on it. When that hot pitch poured off over that real soft balsom, it cased it over and became hard as steel. A law could bump against it and it just bump it away. We're getting somewhere on that. Law could bump against it and it could just bump away. That's the way it is when this little weakly uneducated illiterate ill illiterate person comes to Jesus Christ. That's about what he is. A light piece of balsom wood. But God pours his Holy Spirit in there and seals that man down. And the devils of hell will bump against it, but it'll bump away. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen. That devil's been bumping against you all week. Don't worry. If you got that pitch on the inside, it can't do nothing but bump you and bump away. bump you and bump away. Amen. Depression tries to come in. It'll bump you, but it'll bump away. Anxiety and fear bump you, but bump away. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's what he said in Hebrews chapter 6 and 13. He said, "For when God made the promise to Abraham, because he'd swear could swear by no greater, he swore by himself." Yes. &gt;&gt; So it was God on both ends &gt;&gt; saying, "Surely blessing I will bless thee. Multiply and I will multiply thee." &gt;&gt; And so after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. For men verilely swear by the greater, and the oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife, wherein God willing more bundled showing to the heirs the promise immutility immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath, that by two immutable things, that which it it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation foundation, a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us. Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, which enterth in within into that within the veil. Hebrews and on next verse whether the forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made a high priest forever after the order of Melzdc. But he said this anchor of the soul is both sure and steadfast. Both sure and steadfast. And it's in behind the veil. It is not something that necessarily can be seen like an anchor of a ship. When it's down there, you can't see the anchor, but that doesn't mean it's not holding. &gt;&gt; You know, I I was had an opportunity while I was up in Maine to go on a sailboat. I had never been on a sailboat. Heard about sailboats all my life. Loved them. Looked loved the looks of them. Got to go on one. Pretty cool &gt;&gt; going out there floating on the water and the wind pushing you and just the waves and the winds all you hear and the conversation on the boat. That was pretty neat. But what was a paradox is coming back. We went with the wind going but now we're coming against the wind. Thought how in the world is this doing this? You know I'm just a simple guy. I reckon I usually you know wind it's going that way. Wherever the wind's going it's go. But they have have figured it out. They couldn't do it hundreds of years ago when the Mayflower and all them came across. They they could only sail with the wind. They didn't have it all figured out like they do today. But it came in this in this last bit of time of last hundreds of years, hundred years or whatever, where men begin to figure out how to get the the sails adjusted just right and how to build the boat just right, put a ballast down there. And and I began to look at it on YouTube because I had to have somebody smarter than me to figure all this out and teach me a little bit. So, I watched a video on YouTube and they said they put a balance there on the bottom of the boat and the sails up here. And it's actually an airplane on its side &gt;&gt; and it's a balance between the wind and the water. And they have to tune the sails just right. And listen, I was sitting on that boat coming against that wind. They have to tune it to a point that baby is leaning way over. You think, man, I was on the bottom side of that boat, too, and that didn't feel too good. Sister Ruth didn't like it. She climbed on the top side of the boat. I mean, it was a foot from the water on this side. This side is 6 or 8 foot high off the water. It was leaned way over. But it had to lean like that to pierce through the wind. But there was something that you could not see. You thought, man, this wind's blowing against this boat. How is it not just flipping over and laying on its side? But down underneath something that you could not see was a balance that was put there. And it was weighed just right to keep it in a certain direction so that this thing could sail against the wind. Not only just against the wind, but also the current that was coming in, the tide that was coming in. It was sailing and going through. Now, it wasn't going as fast as what it was. It wasn't going as as nice and as pleasant as what it was, but it was going. &gt;&gt; It was moving forward. And I thought, ain't that the way it is? God has designed a people in this day. He gave them two wings to fly. &gt;&gt; Amen. One is anchored down there. Maybe you can't even see it sometime. And it's so out of your reach and so out of your sight, but it's still there. How do you know it there? Cuz the boat ain't went over yet. &gt;&gt; The boat is still going forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. The winds can blow against it. The current can come against it. All hell can come against it. But she will go through every way, through every wind, through everything. Why? Because she has been built to take the win. &gt;&gt; There's a people on this earth that is actually built for this dimension that we're living in. Are built as we heard Leodysia overcomers. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; To be an overcomer, you got to be built to be an overcomer. That's right. &gt;&gt; There has to be something there that is happening inside of you and it's keeping you. Oh, sometimes it feels like this ship's going to fall over. &gt;&gt; Stay with the ship. &gt;&gt; What would have happened if I said, "Oh, man. Let me get off this baby. I'd probably been under the down bottom of the ocean out there somewhere if there somebody didn't throw me a life jacket." Made you want made you feel like that. I understand when them men in Paul's day wanted to jump off the ship. It didn't feel too good. &gt;&gt; But Paul had received a vision said stay with the ship. &gt;&gt; And being man sometimes you think sometimes man this thing is going to just crumble apart. This thing's there's actually two words and I I think I remember them right. One's listing and one's I think it's called kneeling. I thought that was interesting too. Listing in a boat is not a good thing. and kneeling is okay. It's a good thing. But they're both basically the same thing. That's a paradox, ain't it? Both can look like this and you can say, "Wow, that thing's listing." And it may be true. Listing means this baby's going down. But when a sailman, a real captain of a ship, knows what he does, knows what he's doing, he kneels that thing just right. &gt;&gt; My goodness, he kneels it just right. And it's the same thing, different word. It's in control. &gt;&gt; And I think sometimes when we get our ships been, if we just kneel just right, [Laughter] &gt;&gt; it ain't listening. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Devil, let me tell you something. This ship is high. She ain't listening. &gt;&gt; She ain't listening. She ain't falling over. She ain't falling apart. She ain't going down into the depths of the sea. No, she's doing nothing but kneeling. &gt;&gt; And when she kneels, all heaven is standing at attention. &gt;&gt; All the angels on this highway are saying, "Look at that ship. She's sailing through the wind. She's pushing through the g. Oh, hell is blowing against her. Demons on every kind trying to push her back. But the captain's got her turn just right. She's going to go over every wave. She going to go every so every sickness. She's going to go over every sin. She's going to rise above every devil. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's the anchor of the soul. When anything is anchored, it cannot move. I have an anchor that keeps me whole, steadfast, and sure. While the sea bills roll, anchored to a rock that makes me whole, grounded, safe, and sure in the Savior's love. An anchor. Listen to these words. He said, "When I was out yonder beyond the spray one day, beyond the spray. One day God took this poor lost sinner, pulled him through all that spray." Yes, sir. Brought him over here, anchored him in there, put his arms about me, and everything else. No matter what it is, my soul lookth up to thee. I now have an anchor steadfast and sure. Which hope we have is an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast. Not what not turned around about every doctrine and every wind tossed one side the other turning taking sides over here and taking sides don't don't know where you stand the Bible says I would that you would the Bible said I would that you would be established anchored &gt;&gt; foundation not saying well I'm this today and something else tomorrow anchor your soul in Christ Jesus be born again the life of God living in you and you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you passed from death to life. Your whole hopes is built yonder in Calvary. The love of God pours through your heart and you believe every word that God says the truth. You're willing to die for any phase of it. See what I mean? Steadfast and sure. He said, you know, a ship sometimes the servicemen and so forth know you've been on the sea really gets the waves get to dashing so hard against the boat they'll anchor it. It's got a line that that'll hold down. Oh, it may flip around this way and around that, but there's an anchor that holds it. They can't see land anyway, but they've dropped an anchor beyond the veil within the water. That anchor goes down into the bottom of the sea, tops some big mountain, drags till it catches a mountain, grabs a good stone somewhere, and the seieves can't move it no more. It's anchored out of sight. And every person that's received Jesus Christ as a personal savior, been born again with the Holy Spirit, you've dropped anchor. If you're sick and your hope is built on Christ, you've dropped your anchor &gt;&gt; and the doctor may say this and the doctor may say something else, but you're sure as your faith looks yonder, the waves, the six spells, the fever may rise, everything like that. But your anchor holds beyond the veil. &gt;&gt; Somewhere out yonder this sick land say, "What have you got on your hopes built on?" The doctor says it's gone. The medicine says it can't do nothing. Surgeries have failed. But my hope is not built on that. We have a hope within the veil. What veil? Through the shedding of his blood that tore his spirit from his body. And in between that veil there, the anchor has caught a hold of something. I've seen a ship one time that was so tossed out there. But what was holding the ship in that same spot, I couldn't understand it. But sitting out there in that sea, bobbing up and down, waves, knocking it this way and this way, but staying right there, I couldn't see nothing. But there was this little wire rope that ran out of the bow of that ship into an anchor caught beneath somewhere into a rock beyond that water and it was holding. Praise be to God. I said, "One day I also found that same anchor." &gt;&gt; Sure, I may bob around and I may move and things may get a little hilar every once in a while, but I shall not be moved. I cast an anchor beyond something I can't see and something is caught hold. And when the battle is raging, the anchor holds within the veil. And when if if the devils rise and troubles arise and all those things around me give way, my anchor will hold. Where's it at? It's in the rock of ages. It's in that firm foundation. that foundation stone that's steadfast, unmovable, and it will hold sure and steadfast. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. Real faith doesn't shift by creeds or man-made doctrines and unbelief. It stays right with the word. Real faith in the word. Where can you put your faith in anything else but the word? real faith. It doesn't shift. It draws from God's book, the Bible, his attributes, what he promised, his word. And the word produces itself. It has to be a thought before word. And the word may then becomes manifested. That's where you draw your strength from. That's where you anchor yourself, the word. Amen. Hallelujah. Maybe tonight just want to say, "God, I I I just need my anchor just to grab a little little tighter. Maybe this ballast can just level me out just a little bit. Lord, I've been in the in this water rocking around, but I just need to just tighten up the ropes a little bit because I know that anchor holds." Bless you tonight, saints. Bless you tonight. Lord Jesus, thank you for the anchor that holds. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Father, for a firm foundation, something we can stand upon. We can have true faith in, Lord, that when all hell is against us, waves are crashing in and winds blowing, we can pierce right through every gale, crest every wave, because there's something that's holding us and there's something that's drawing us. It's a paradox, Lord. This road we're on is anchored in two places. One around your throne, one in the rock, Christ Jesus. Thank you for those angels that gives us help along the way. Those extra pushes we need sometimes. Thank you, Lord, that they surround us, with us, guiding us, helping us along life's journey, our weakest moments. We love you, Lord, and we praise you. Bless the hands that were lifted all over this building, Lord. May we just tighten up the ropes, Lord, and make our anchors sure that it'll be steadfast and steady. That no matter what comes our way, Lord, that we'll be able to crest through every bit of it. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Let's stand together. Let's sing that song. I shall not be moved.
