[58:04] Revelation chap 1 and9 and I want to
[58:09] read from the scripture today Revelation
[58:12] chapter 1 and we will read from verse
[58:16] 9 I John who also am your brother and
[58:20] companion in
[58:22] Tribulation and in the kingdom and
[58:24] patience of Jesus Christ was on the
[58:27] aisle that is called patmas for the word
[58:30] of the Lord and for the testimony of
[58:32] Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the
[58:37] Lord's day and I heard behind me a great
[58:40] voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha
[58:44] and Omega the first and the last and
[58:48] what thou seest right in a book and send
[58:50] to the seven churches which are in Asia
[58:54] unto Ephesus and to Smyrna and the
[58:57] pergamus and thyra and to Sardis and
[59:00] into Philadelphia and he didn't leave
[59:02] out the end time he said into
[59:04] leoda and I turned to see the voice that
[59:07] spake with me and being turned I saw
[59:11] seven golden
[59:12] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[59:15] seven candlesticks one lik un to the son
[59:17] of man clothed with a garment down to
[59:20] the foot and gird about the paps with a
[59:22] golden girdle and I'd like you to turn
[59:25] with me to 1 Corinthians 14:1 15 one
[59:29] verse there what is it then I pray with
[59:33] the spirit I will pray with the
[59:35] understanding also I will sing with the
[59:38] spirit and I will sing with the
[59:41] understanding also God bless you can be
[59:47] seated I want to speak today on getting
[59:49] in the
[59:51] spirit I here he says in in
[59:56] this chapter of Revelation that we have
[59:59] just read it pictures him in a very
[1:00:04] Barren deserted place on the aisle of
[1:00:07] patmas he put out there with a bunch of
[1:00:10] criminals for the word of God and for
[1:00:12] the testimony of Jesus Christ not for
[1:00:14] doing something evil or bad but you know
[1:00:17] by just serving God he's here in a very
[1:00:21] difficult place in
[1:00:22] life and you know it is it's been really
[1:00:26] busy all around and people are wondering
[1:00:28] about the coming of the Lord and and
[1:00:31] they're saying John you know you're
[1:00:32] getting old and you know you you know he
[1:00:35] told you you'd live to see his coming
[1:00:38] and yet you know um you're still here
[1:00:41] and and um you're getting older it's got
[1:00:43] to be any day John and of course John
[1:00:45] would write in in his gospel and he said
[1:00:48] but they misunderstood the Lord he
[1:00:50] didn't say that I would T till he come
[1:00:53] but what is it today if he terries till
[1:00:55] I come you see a lot of times when
[1:00:58] prophecies come even though you heard
[1:01:00] them they're still a
[1:01:02] misunderstood because even in your own
[1:01:04] mind things get interpreted and you know
[1:01:07] slanted by what you heard that's what I
[1:01:10] heard him say and this what I took him
[1:01:12] to mean and they had taken him to mean
[1:01:15] that the Lord was coming at any moment
[1:01:17] and and surely John surely John you know
[1:01:20] we're looking at you you're getting
[1:01:21] older and you're running out of time and
[1:01:24] when are you when is the Lord coming I
[1:01:25] mean I mean you know what did he say to
[1:01:27] you what well you know he he didn't tell
[1:01:30] us about his coming he said that day and
[1:01:32] that hour I can't tell you that only the
[1:01:34] father knows because here I am is a in
[1:01:38] in man form and here there's only some
[1:01:41] things that I can see as a in in this
[1:01:43] form because I I come to overcome as a
[1:01:47] man and and and I didn't come to live
[1:01:50] this life as a God but I came to live it
[1:01:53] as a man to overcome as you overcome and
[1:01:55] go through things like you go through
[1:01:58] and and so I can't tell you everything
[1:02:02] but because of this saying God takes him
[1:02:05] up onto the aisle of patmas and you know
[1:02:08] sometimes the government will do some
[1:02:10] many funny things you know they the
[1:02:13] devil will actually work and do
[1:02:15] something for his plans and yet it's
[1:02:17] God's plans all the time because nothing
[1:02:21] gets out of cater with a Christian
[1:02:23] everything is in place everything is
[1:02:26] where he supposed to be God has it all
[1:02:29] orchestrated and all things are working
[1:02:32] out together for your good because God's
[1:02:35] got a purpose and a plan in life he's
[1:02:38] not an author of frustration but he's an
[1:02:40] author of peace and so when we're
[1:02:42] looking at this he says um he's he's out
[1:02:46] on the aisle of patmas and the
[1:02:48] government has uh has arrested him and
[1:02:51] put false charges against him and put
[1:02:53] him over here on the aisle of Patmos for
[1:02:55] for the testimony of Jesus Christ and
[1:02:58] and holding him in a Barren place with a
[1:03:00] bunch of criminal and he gets a little
[1:03:02] bit of rest out there and while he's
[1:03:05] resting from all of the questions that
[1:03:07] are going on from the Believers God
[1:03:10] comes to him and reveals to him his
[1:03:12] coming that's right and and so here in
[1:03:17] this moment the Bible said I was in the
[1:03:21] spirit on the Lord's
[1:03:24] day now it wasn't just a Sabbath that he
[1:03:27] was on it wasn't a Sunday that it was on
[1:03:30] but he was actually carried into the
[1:03:33] spirit into the eternals into the day of
[1:03:37] the Lord he got in the
[1:03:39] spirit this is something is very
[1:03:42] important for us as Believers to realize
[1:03:45] you know really it's not about this life
[1:03:49] it's even not about the way we sing or
[1:03:52] our our voices or whatever it's really
[1:03:54] about getting in the spirit brother
[1:03:57] Brandon would talk about this and he
[1:03:59] said I would call those words the whole
[1:04:02] of Christian Life In other words this is
[1:04:05] so important to us this should be our
[1:04:08] goal our aim our desire to get in the
[1:04:13] spirit you know again if we're going to
[1:04:16] live as Christians we have to be in his
[1:04:19] spirit and John was not talking about
[1:04:22] his own Spirit of course I would not
[1:04:24] have brought to his visions and had to
[1:04:26] be the spirit of God and it has to be
[1:04:28] the spirit of God with us too or yet all
[1:04:31] our effort even all our worship is in
[1:04:34] vain because he would say to them in
[1:04:37] that day in vain do you worship me
[1:04:39] because you're teaching for Doctor the
[1:04:41] Commandments of men you're never getting
[1:04:43] into the spirit of the thing you're
[1:04:45] never really seeing what I'm saying
[1:04:48] you're not really comprehending it's not
[1:04:51] getting a hold of you you're not moving
[1:04:53] into the Realms of the Eternal you're
[1:04:55] too carnal in your
[1:04:58] beliefs this would happen over and over
[1:05:00] again with so many but you see if
[1:05:03] there's anything's going to be good is
[1:05:05] like Paul said if I sing I'll sing in
[1:05:08] the spirit if I pray let me pray in the
[1:05:11] spirit amen you know because it is there
[1:05:14] where that if it's going to be revealed
[1:05:17] it has to be revealed by the spirit and
[1:05:20] and it then confirmed by the word it
[1:05:22] made manifest by the results that it
[1:05:24] bears and so you know John needed to
[1:05:28] receive these these um tremendous
[1:05:31] Revelations fresh from Jesus and as
[1:05:34] surely as he did we need to be in the
[1:05:37] spirit to understand to wrap our minds
[1:05:41] around what God is doing in our
[1:05:44] generation and to see it in the
[1:05:46] importance of what it is meant to
[1:05:50] be you know this week I dreamed and I
[1:05:53] dreamed I was in a church service just
[1:05:55] like like this and there were people in
[1:05:58] attendance I knew them I knew who they
[1:06:00] were they were just sitting there and
[1:06:03] but yet you know they were in attendance
[1:06:06] but it was as they were spiritually
[1:06:09] dead there was I had no response to
[1:06:12] worship there was no response to the
[1:06:14] preaching they were just
[1:06:17] there and I spoke to them and I said it
[1:06:20] does no good just to come to church and
[1:06:22] yet never get in the spirit
[1:06:26] now I you know I just want to say to you
[1:06:28] today even what good is it to just
[1:06:31] attend church without getting in the
[1:06:35] spirit you see it is a form of
[1:06:39] godliness it is something that every
[1:06:41] believer should do every believer should
[1:06:43] go to church it ought to be his custom
[1:06:46] it ought to be what we
[1:06:48] do but it's got to be more than just
[1:06:51] coming amen but we must we must not Den
[1:06:55] deny the power come on church amen but
[1:06:59] but but again we must have the anointing
[1:07:02] come down and it becomes and when it
[1:07:05] comes you see it's the power of God but
[1:07:08] just attending church just go into the
[1:07:10] motion of singing just going through the
[1:07:12] motion of prayers with never get in the
[1:07:14] spirit is just a form of godliness that
[1:07:18] denies the
[1:07:20] power and we are counseled in the
[1:07:23] scripture turn away from that yes sir
[1:07:27] amen this is very
[1:07:29] important you see even in preaching it's
[1:07:33] not preaching unless the Speaker gets in
[1:07:35] the
[1:07:37] spirit amen it's it's just an
[1:07:39] intellectual talk it's a lecture it's a
[1:07:43] speech but unless it's anointed amen it
[1:07:47] that's all it is amen preaching it must
[1:07:51] be is only preaching when it gets
[1:07:53] anointed when the Holy Spirit Come comes
[1:07:55] down takes the man over and speaks
[1:07:58] things that oh my in the spirit he never
[1:08:01] even knew he would ever even say but the
[1:08:04] Holy Spirit takes him over you see the
[1:08:07] Bible said in 1 Peter 4:11 If any man
[1:08:10] speak let him speak as an oracle of God
[1:08:14] in other words whoever speaks is as let
[1:08:18] him speak as utterances of God let it be
[1:08:21] God uttering through him let it be the
[1:08:25] voice of God speaking amen again are you
[1:08:29] called the preach then preach as though
[1:08:31] it was God himself we speaking through
[1:08:35] you there there again this is what it
[1:08:38] must be it must be a man yielded to the
[1:08:41] spirit of God not just getting up with
[1:08:44] because he is gifted he has a he is an
[1:08:48] aror and able to get up before a crowd
[1:08:50] and you know he has a personality that
[1:08:53] is attractive no that's not it is it is
[1:08:56] that you preach and you allow God to
[1:08:59] speak through you anybody can give a
[1:09:02] speech amen but it takes the anointing
[1:09:05] of God to preach now some men have
[1:09:08] claimed they can preach without the
[1:09:09] anointing I've never seen one preach
[1:09:11] I've seen them give a talk amen but it
[1:09:13] ain't worth
[1:09:15] anything unless the spirit
[1:09:17] comes I would you to understand folks
[1:09:20] you know it's not worth anything unless
[1:09:23] the spirit comes get it down in your
[1:09:26] heart this morning to realize even our
[1:09:28] worship is in vain unless the spirit
[1:09:31] comes I was in the spirit here again you
[1:09:36] know brother Brandon would tell us again
[1:09:38] about a a minister and he said let me
[1:09:40] just share it he said I first thing I
[1:09:43] would say according to rules of the
[1:09:44] church in the New Testament at the first
[1:09:46] place people entered the Church of God
[1:09:49] in a spirit of worship that walked in
[1:09:51] hymns were sang and maybe the preacher
[1:09:54] would speak for he for he was the
[1:09:56] prophet of the
[1:09:58] church amen a new testament Prophet is a
[1:10:03] preacher we know that the testimony of
[1:10:06] Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy
[1:10:10] said Revelation right that's in the last
[1:10:13] chapter and a lot of people don't know
[1:10:15] that a man a man who is preaching is
[1:10:17] actually prophesying if he's under the
[1:10:21] anointing when the anointing comes it's
[1:10:23] God using his voice voice it's God
[1:10:26] speaking a message that he is
[1:10:28] predestined for that moment and when God
[1:10:31] speaks you must
[1:10:34] hear you must listen you must embrace
[1:10:38] it now so again you said well I don't
[1:10:42] know about this um preacher of being a
[1:10:46] new testament Prophet well that's what
[1:10:47] the prophet taught us and and you said
[1:10:50] well but we only have one Prophet yeah
[1:10:53] one major prophet
[1:10:55] One Church age messenger one seventh
[1:10:58] angel one
[1:11:00] Elijah there's not going to be another
[1:11:03] come on nobody else to raise up but
[1:11:06] they're still
[1:11:07] prophets amen when he assited on high he
[1:11:10] sent gifts back to men Apostles prophets
[1:11:13] teachers evangelists and pastors amen
[1:11:16] these are gifts that God gives and when
[1:11:19] they get anointed by the spirit of God
[1:11:22] they are God's voice to you
[1:11:26] and so it's the testimony of Jesus
[1:11:28] Christ you know the preacher be brother
[1:11:30] Brandon said now the preacher begin to
[1:11:32] preach and while he preach the blessings
[1:11:34] maybe in the end the big sermon Begin to
[1:11:37] Fall um the the people would say amen
[1:11:40] and go to blessing God now he's given
[1:11:42] the order of the New Testament Church
[1:11:46] the preacher would preach he would get
[1:11:47] under the anointing and then the
[1:11:50] blessings would fall and and then they
[1:11:53] go to blessing God and as soon as he
[1:11:55] stop preaching there would there would
[1:11:57] be a message maybe go forth maybe
[1:12:01] speaking in with unknown tongues First
[1:12:02] Corinthians 14:13-14 then if there be no
[1:12:05] interpreter in the church this person is
[1:12:07] supposed to hold this their their peace
[1:12:10] because they're speaking in tongues
[1:12:12] correctly but they do it before God so
[1:12:14] if they speak in tongues and nobody
[1:12:16] inter interprets well don't give any
[1:12:18] more tongues there's not an interpreter
[1:12:19] in the
[1:12:21] house amen you see there but if they're
[1:12:25] speaking in tongues and there's an
[1:12:27] interpreter an interpreter is supposed
[1:12:28] to give the message all the all churches
[1:12:32] are coming to that so I'm just telling
[1:12:35] you what he said you know people say
[1:12:37] well say what he said well that's what
[1:12:39] he
[1:12:40] said but as we want to say again is in 1
[1:12:44] John 2:20 but you have an unction from
[1:12:49] the Holy One an unction that's an
[1:12:54] anointing
[1:12:56] you have an anointing from the Holy One
[1:12:59] you have been set apart you have been
[1:13:03] specially gifted you have been prepared
[1:13:06] by the Holy Spirit and all of you know
[1:13:09] the truth because the because he teaches
[1:13:12] us illuminates our mind he guards us
[1:13:15] from error we don't have to worry about
[1:13:17] being
[1:13:18] deceived the elect is not going to be
[1:13:21] deceived come on amen yeah there's a
[1:13:24] deception going on in the world today
[1:13:26] but not for
[1:13:27] you because the elect will not be
[1:13:30] deceived oh can they be misguided can
[1:13:32] they make wrong steps can they can they
[1:13:35] hold the things wrong sometimes thinking
[1:13:37] they're right
[1:13:38] yes but got to get them back on track
[1:13:41] don't
[1:13:42] worry he knows how to do it so you know
[1:13:45] as brother bradam tells us and let me
[1:13:47] quote him here he said you Brethren you
[1:13:50] have never preached a sermon in your
[1:13:52] life now let me just say brother Aaron
[1:13:55] me Timothy brother Joe God bless him
[1:13:58] he's out ministering today but you've
[1:14:00] never preached a sermon in your life the
[1:14:02] Holy Spirit preached a sermon through
[1:14:06] you I'm
[1:14:07] quoting that's right see we don't preach
[1:14:11] the Holy Spirit does the speaking oh we
[1:14:15] might write out something and read it
[1:14:17] but that isn't preaching preaching is
[1:14:19] when inspiration comes and it is
[1:14:22] preached by inspiration and the the holy
[1:14:25] spirit gives the
[1:14:28] unction amen I love it when he says it
[1:14:31] there you have an
[1:14:33] un you have an anointing you are
[1:14:38] anointed
[1:14:39] people
[1:14:41] hallelujah what what a word that this is
[1:14:44] to us today not just receiving
[1:14:46] intellectual speakers be Spees because
[1:14:49] any man can get up and give a speech but
[1:14:51] it takes a call and an anointing from
[1:14:54] God to
[1:14:56] preach so well why do you preach well
[1:14:59] cuz Jesus told me to because Paul told
[1:15:02] me to because the seventh angel told me
[1:15:04] to and because God told me
[1:15:07] to amen so we are instructed in the word
[1:15:11] that there would be those who would
[1:15:13] preach men who would be Oracles of God
[1:15:16] men who would who would speak the words
[1:15:19] of God now let me just realize it is an
[1:15:23] intellectual it isn't how smart we are
[1:15:27] you see we we have not drawn you even to
[1:15:30] this place you're not even drawn to this
[1:15:32] message because we had the most
[1:15:34] intellectual man you know we had this
[1:15:36] great wizard brain wizard you know here
[1:15:39] that that's smarter than all the rest
[1:15:42] and so we were attracted to the message
[1:15:44] because of how intelligent brother
[1:15:45] brandham was now he was intelligent
[1:15:48] there's no
[1:15:50] dummy but that wasn't what got
[1:15:53] us it wasn't even the the proof of in
[1:15:57] his intelligence would have been so many
[1:15:59] degrees on the wall you know from
[1:16:01] colleges and whatever proven that he'
[1:16:04] passed certain tests and made made
[1:16:06] certain qualifications but that isn't
[1:16:08] What attracted us What attracted us was
[1:16:12] the
[1:16:13] spirit we saw the Holy
[1:16:18] Ghost we saw the word
[1:16:20] demonstrated we saw the power of God
[1:16:24] that's our
[1:16:29] attraction amen now you see again today
[1:16:34] churches are full of churches that are
[1:16:37] are there trying to get them in the
[1:16:39] church by intellectual
[1:16:41] speeches but but we don't need
[1:16:44] intellectual
[1:16:45] speeches what we need is the baptism of
[1:16:48] the Holy Ghost with power with
[1:16:50] demonstration manifestation of the
[1:16:52] spirit that is our greatest
[1:16:56] attraction our greatest attraction isn't
[1:16:59] because we got men that can oh man he
[1:17:02] they can wow you with with great
[1:17:04] Revelations and Mysteries and
[1:17:06] understanding you know I I'll just say
[1:17:08] to to begin it's one of my coin phrases
[1:17:11] you'll hear me say it from time to time
[1:17:13] I hate mystery
[1:17:17] preachers because when they get through
[1:17:19] it's still a
[1:17:22] mystery amen Don't Preach me a mystery
[1:17:26] the Mysteries have been revealed preach
[1:17:27] me the
[1:17:29] Revelation amen and the Revelation is it
[1:17:32] becomes simple it can be received by you
[1:17:36] know it's sure it was a mystery it was
[1:17:38] held out of our understanding God did
[1:17:40] that for a purpose for the end time but
[1:17:42] not for any longer that's right come on
[1:17:45] church I'll hold the mystery back back
[1:17:47] in the days of the voice of the seven
[1:17:50] Angel when he shall begin the S the
[1:17:52] mystery of God will be finished amen it
[1:17:55] a a time to preach Mysteries we're
[1:17:57] preaching
[1:17:59] understanding we can preach the
[1:18:01] Revelation oh I hear them you know
[1:18:03] somebody asked me a question the other
[1:18:05] day and the other you know it was it was
[1:18:07] over in Europe and the little person was
[1:18:10] trying to speak to me in French and I
[1:18:12] didn't get much of their French so
[1:18:14] somebody was trying to interpret it and
[1:18:16] I I was trying to explain something to
[1:18:19] her and she was an elderly person you
[1:18:21] know and I was trying to to get it to
[1:18:24] and the person wasn't speaking very good
[1:18:27] french well maybe good french but not
[1:18:29] understanding good English finally he
[1:18:31] just desperately Shrugged and said it's
[1:18:33] a revelation in it
[1:18:37] right and I
[1:18:39] said no it isn't a revelation it's been
[1:18:44] revealed it's no longer a mystery it's
[1:18:48] no longer some hidden
[1:18:50] secret it is something revealed it's
[1:18:53] unveiled
[1:18:55] it's
[1:18:58] plain now now God chose in you know
[1:19:03] illiterate and ignorant men who could
[1:19:05] not speak well men who couldn't even
[1:19:08] read their name and the Bible said it in
[1:19:11] the in the book of Acts when it
[1:19:13] described the disciples said these are
[1:19:16] ignorant and unlearned men but we'll
[1:19:19] tell you something about
[1:19:22] them they've been with Jesus yes amen we
[1:19:26] can tell this about them they didn't get
[1:19:29] their recommendation from us they didn't
[1:19:32] get their credentials from us but where
[1:19:36] they got it from here's why we know look
[1:19:39] he just raised up this man this crippled
[1:19:41] man we know these men have been with
[1:19:44] Jesus that ought to be the testimony of
[1:19:47] every every preacher every person we
[1:19:51] have been with Jesus
[1:19:55] even even the slogan of brother
[1:19:57] Brandon's a sermon they would preach
[1:19:59] over again it say we would see
[1:20:03] Jesus this ought to be the goal of every
[1:20:06] time we come to church amen not to see a
[1:20:09] man not to seeing pretty songs not just
[1:20:12] to have a little time of of
[1:20:14] entertainment Church isn't about
[1:20:16] entertainment s we will see Jesus
[1:20:26] if you think of it God chose an
[1:20:29] illiterate Kentucky preacher to be his
[1:20:31] voice to this last age and you might ask
[1:20:35] why why would God choose a seventh great
[1:20:42] Kian so he wouldn't lean on his own
[1:20:49] understanding but to be taught of the
[1:20:51] Lord this is important some somebody who
[1:20:55] would get it from the
[1:20:58] Spirit come on that's the way this
[1:21:01] message came it came without men's
[1:21:04] intellectual abilities as I said not
[1:21:07] that the prophet wasn't intellectual or
[1:21:09] that you know it was an intelligent I
[1:21:11] meant far from it but rather he didn't
[1:21:14] lean on his intelligence but was moved
[1:21:17] by the Spirit come on church amen now
[1:21:22] you see but today we we come and we we
[1:21:25] move forward we advance in years and the
[1:21:28] message and and I I just want to say the
[1:21:32] vision of of the Bride where where he
[1:21:35] saw the vision of the church and then
[1:21:37] the vision of the Bride you know
[1:21:39] remember and he said that they they were
[1:21:42] he had the preview and he saw them and
[1:21:45] the the condition as it started out a
[1:21:48] beautiful select elected group of women
[1:21:52] Marching In Tune and Harmony and they
[1:21:54] were in the spirit of Onward Christian
[1:21:57] Soldiers going forward advancing I like
[1:22:02] that amen and then then he would see the
[1:22:05] degression as it moved over into Europe
[1:22:08] and the gospel moves into America and
[1:22:10] how worse and worse and worse and worse
[1:22:13] it
[1:22:14] became and he could even see them going
[1:22:16] down as they come to the end rather than
[1:22:19] going up and he said I then he said I
[1:22:22] thought my my my mind
[1:22:25] is that the best I could do is that the
[1:22:27] best all the gospel preaching could do
[1:22:30] is to get is to do the do it like this
[1:22:33] you know preach with all our hearts and
[1:22:35] this is the
[1:22:37] results a bunch of
[1:22:40] rejected people out of the spirit
[1:22:43] dancing into the tune the rhythm of the
[1:22:46] world to the tune of rock and roll going
[1:22:49] on down and into these things moving
[1:22:52] into this that's the the best I could
[1:22:56] do and he said about that time he said I
[1:23:00] saw and heard the music change and I saw
[1:23:05] that group of women coming
[1:23:07] again he said here they come again at
[1:23:10] the end time he said look the bride will
[1:23:13] come
[1:23:15] again and then he said I saw some of
[1:23:17] them in the back and I that's where I
[1:23:19] want to say we're at we're in the
[1:23:22] back amen we're way way down the line
[1:23:26] we've been many many years in this come
[1:23:28] on we where there's many of us that just
[1:23:31] got in the in the parade as it was but
[1:23:35] he said I saw them get out of
[1:23:38] Step because they were looking they were
[1:23:42] looking and watching what they were
[1:23:43] these others were doing listen we cannot
[1:23:46] look and see what the others are doing
[1:23:48] we cannot gaze upon them or pattern from
[1:23:51] them or take from the denominational
[1:23:54] system
[1:23:55] come on church amen we must be a people
[1:23:58] who instead of get out of the spirit get
[1:24:01] in the
[1:24:02] [Applause]
[1:24:04] spirit but it wasn't all gone it wasn't
[1:24:06] all hopeless it wasn't all
[1:24:09] lost he said as they got out of Step I
[1:24:12] heard my voice scream out get back in
[1:24:18] line see it wasn't they weren't bride
[1:24:24] many times many times men will get out
[1:24:28] of Step they'll get out of Harmony
[1:24:32] sometimes they
[1:24:34] misunderstand but they'll get back in
[1:24:37] line they're the elect right they just
[1:24:40] got to get in the
[1:24:41] spirit somebody help me now amen now
[1:24:45] brother brandham brother brandham told
[1:24:47] us you know if education was to take
[1:24:50] take the place then Christ would
[1:24:52] establish schools when it when he was
[1:24:54] here on the earth and and that's what
[1:24:56] I'm trying to say listen psychology will
[1:24:59] never which is behavioral change we can
[1:25:03] never replace the
[1:25:06] spirit amen come on even theology
[1:25:10] knowing the word cannot replace the Holy
[1:25:16] Ghost that's right W if I speak in
[1:25:19] tongues you know like men and angels and
[1:25:22] and and if I have all the gifts
[1:25:26] yeah if I know all the
[1:25:33] Mysteries and have not this holy spirit
[1:25:36] of God it don't
[1:25:39] matter you can clutch your sealed
[1:25:42] book and miss the
[1:25:46] Rapture God ain't rapturing books he's
[1:25:49] rapturing people who are
[1:25:51] changed people who have been caught up
[1:25:53] in the spirit yes amen listen you see if
[1:25:57] Psychology was what was needed then
[1:25:59] Christ would have ordained
[1:26:03] psychologist but God didn't ordain
[1:26:05] psychologist said brother Jim why would
[1:26:07] you preach like this because those in
[1:26:09] the back we're having problems with even
[1:26:12] ministers in the back who are back there
[1:26:15] now you know introducing psychology and
[1:26:18] and having having
[1:26:20] seminars to to to change the behavior
[1:26:24] people listen that ain't what you need
[1:26:26] you need to get in the spirit somebody
[1:26:30] needs to get anointed with the Holy
[1:26:31] Ghost and preach the word with power and
[1:26:35] that power
[1:26:39] deliver amen now brother bradam warned
[1:26:43] of becoming imperfect strength and by
[1:26:45] Perfect weakness he taught he talk when
[1:26:48] we realize our weakness that our
[1:26:52] intellect cannot accomplish the
[1:26:55] job that's when we will seek the Lord
[1:26:58] and receive strength for the
[1:27:01] job now he told us that demons were
[1:27:05] streaming loose everywhere they're
[1:27:07] coming he said out of tombstones out of
[1:27:10] morgs churches that you know the
[1:27:13] spiritual thermometer is 90° below
[1:27:16] zero you know he said he said that
[1:27:19] demons are streaming loose saying and
[1:27:22] they're crying the days of Miracles are
[1:27:24] house and we don't need the Holy Ghost
[1:27:26] you say well they would never say that
[1:27:28] no they won't come right out and say
[1:27:29] that but what they say is it was that
[1:27:34] was for another
[1:27:36] time that was only for that healing
[1:27:40] movement that was only for that era we
[1:27:45] we've got the word now well pardon me if
[1:27:48] you got the word that look like to me
[1:27:51] you would have
[1:27:52] everything if you got a open book you
[1:27:55] would have every promise of God you
[1:27:58] would have healing miracles signs
[1:28:01] wonders come on the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:04] Ghost the shout of the king in the midst
[1:28:06] the holy ghost moving among the people
[1:28:08] there would be I it will be poured out
[1:28:10] his Spirit upon All Flesh Sons and
[1:28:13] Daughters would
[1:28:15] prophesy old men would see dream dreams
[1:28:17] young men re see visions
[1:28:25] so they would never say days of Miracles
[1:28:27] are passed and we don't need the Holy
[1:28:31] Ghost so they would never say it that
[1:28:34] way but they're saying the same
[1:28:40] thing we don't need the holy we don't
[1:28:42] need the Holy Ghost who would say we
[1:28:44] don't need the Holy Ghost a ain't a
[1:28:46] Baptist Methodist preser and Catholic
[1:28:48] any of them would say we don't need the
[1:28:50] Holy Ghost there's not not any but what
[1:28:53] will they say
[1:28:55] we don't need to be filled with the
[1:28:56] spirit like acts
[1:28:58] two we don't need an
[1:29:01] experience you see that was only for
[1:29:03] them back you see days of Miracles are
[1:29:08] passed and you know why you know why
[1:29:11] this has happened cuz we got men in the
[1:29:13] Pulpit that have never experienced
[1:29:17] God Amen they're not anointed by the
[1:29:20] spirit they don't know the anointing
[1:29:22] amen they don't they you see again
[1:29:25] brother Bram said they there these are
[1:29:28] coming there from from these from these
[1:29:31] um tombs tombstones crying days of
[1:29:35] Miracles has passed and we don't need
[1:29:37] the Holy Ghost and who can tame that
[1:29:40] devil you remember I've been preaching
[1:29:42] about Revelation chapter n and the
[1:29:44] influx of demonic spirits and it coming
[1:29:47] against the bride in an ecclesiastical
[1:29:50] manner right not physical
[1:29:57] but in ecclesiastical Manner and he says
[1:30:00] who can tame that devil we can't do it
[1:30:03] by ecclesiastical forces but there was a
[1:30:06] voice one time that did amen that Tamed
[1:30:08] them Devils put them in the right mind
[1:30:10] put clothes on them and that same voice
[1:30:13] give us a promise The Works that I do
[1:30:15] shall you do also you'll never do it
[1:30:18] under an ecclesiastical gasoline in a
[1:30:21] carbon struck car you'll never do it in
[1:30:24] organization you you do it when you
[1:30:26] empty up and become weak and pour all
[1:30:28] yourself out and let the Holy Ghost come
[1:30:31] in and flood over every part of you and
[1:30:34] saturate every lid of your
[1:30:37] body amen I I pray there'll be bodies
[1:30:41] this morning saturated with the Holy
[1:30:44] Ghost people who get in the
[1:30:49] spirit
[1:30:51] now as brother Bram said if we only need
[1:30:54] the intellectual conception of man we
[1:30:56] don't need the Holy Spirit and if the
[1:30:59] churches to be run and governed up on
[1:31:01] the intellects the educational program
[1:31:03] you say brother Jim ain't no educational
[1:31:05] program listen you know we we have we
[1:31:07] have taken this until we
[1:31:10] educate people into the
[1:31:14] message it's
[1:31:16] educational
[1:31:18] programs where we teach them how to
[1:31:21] behave here and we teach them how to
[1:31:24] dress and we teach them certain
[1:31:27] doctrines and and and it becomes an
[1:31:29] educational program listen friends you
[1:31:32] know honestly you'll not have to preach
[1:31:35] another sermon on Holiness if you get
[1:31:38] people filled with the Holy
[1:31:40] Ghost it'll be the holy God on the
[1:31:43] inside living out his holy
[1:31:46] life I won't even be needed I mean you
[1:31:49] won't have to say one thing about short
[1:31:51] dresses and and bobbed hair and cutting
[1:31:54] hair and trimming it off and painting
[1:31:55] your face you won't have to say none of
[1:31:57] that if you get the Holy
[1:32:00] Ghost those who chafe against it and
[1:32:02] push against it are people without the
[1:32:04] Holy Ghost I'll tell you right now you
[1:32:06] hear them saying you know this don't
[1:32:08] matter here and this don't matter here
[1:32:10] it's because you have never got in the
[1:32:12] spirit you might have come to church you
[1:32:15] might have been born on a message Pew
[1:32:17] but you have never been filled with the
[1:32:19] Holy Ghost where your nature is
[1:32:22] changed so you you'll give voice to the
[1:32:25] world instead of voice to the
[1:32:28] word you see again if if it's to be run
[1:32:33] by the Holy Spirit then we don't need
[1:32:35] the
[1:32:37] intellectuals amen it's either one of
[1:32:39] the other am it's a day where the church
[1:32:43] has actually rejected the Holy
[1:32:47] Spirit just like the brothers of Joseph
[1:32:49] didn't want that
[1:32:51] dreamer you remember he was a spirit
[1:32:53] field man you know they you know they
[1:32:55] didn't want that Holy that Holy Spirit
[1:32:58] they resented the supernatural happening
[1:33:01] in their midst rather than embracing it
[1:33:04] and saying oh we don't know how this is
[1:33:07] going to happen but praise God he's
[1:33:09] raised up by our young brother here and
[1:33:12] he he's going to exalt him such a place
[1:33:15] and and and and and position God's got a
[1:33:18] a plan and a hope and a future for us
[1:33:21] but instead of doing that they resist
[1:33:24] ented the word of the Lord they resented
[1:33:28] the anointing that was upon the upon
[1:33:31] Joseph they resented the Supernatural
[1:33:34] and they thought we'll never need this
[1:33:36] guy so what we'll
[1:33:38] do is we'll kill him and then one you
[1:33:41] know got his mind on money and he said
[1:33:43] no tell you what we better out be better
[1:33:45] off with some money than to kill him so
[1:33:47] sell
[1:33:49] him so they sold him well not knowing
[1:33:53] not knowing they were prophesying of
[1:33:55] what Israel would do thousands of years
[1:33:59] later they would sell the
[1:34:02] Supernatural come on Amen and and that's
[1:34:06] exactly what would happen they would
[1:34:07] reject Christ and they would they would
[1:34:09] selling for 30 pieces of silver and and
[1:34:12] for money and the same thing would
[1:34:14] happen with with Joseph's brothers they
[1:34:18] didn't want this
[1:34:20] dreamer they didn't want the spirit
[1:34:26] amen so you
[1:34:29] see like I
[1:34:31] said they think with their own
[1:34:34] intellectual mind I mean here I am I'm
[1:34:36] I'm the firstborn here and and I'm I'm
[1:34:39] the one here I'm I'm better to able to
[1:34:42] set the church in order better than what
[1:34:44] the Holy Spirit could
[1:34:47] do but they don't need it any
[1:34:50] longer we don't need it
[1:34:54] quoting the prophet we don't need the
[1:34:56] Holy Spirit to heal the sick we got
[1:35:00] doctors we don't need the Holy Spirit to
[1:35:03] speak with tongues we're all intelligent
[1:35:07] people now now Church listen I I I don't
[1:35:10] want I don't want a bunch of just people
[1:35:13] you know just a bunch of tongue speaking
[1:35:15] and confusion and and
[1:35:17] nonsense I don't see impersonation and
[1:35:20] people trying to manufacture something
[1:35:23] please don't do
[1:35:25] it amen don't do it you'll spare
[1:35:28] yourself and me a whole lot of trouble
[1:35:30] that's right but I tell you what I am
[1:35:32] going to do I'm going to say it's in the
[1:35:34] Bible I am going to say it's for the
[1:35:37] church I am to say that the Holy Spirit
[1:35:40] does those things amen and we should we
[1:35:43] welcome
[1:35:45] it come
[1:35:47] on so they say well now listen I'm
[1:35:52] talking about mainstream message men
[1:35:55] stand up and preach whether or not
[1:35:57] preaching speaking can't say that under
[1:36:00] inspiration under inspiration you can't
[1:36:02] say these things so well we do you know
[1:36:06] you want gifts you want speaking in
[1:36:07] tongues you know it's CU you're you're
[1:36:09] just Pentecostal babies grow
[1:36:12] up no the that was a mature church
[1:36:16] that's right come on read the book of
[1:36:18] Acts amen realize what they were they
[1:36:20] were a mature church this is what the
[1:36:22] seed did
[1:36:24] the seed had signs and wonders the seed
[1:36:27] had manifestation the seed had the power
[1:36:29] of God the seed God in the spirit that
[1:36:33] was the seed
[1:36:35] Church well of course they wasn't like
[1:36:37] that in Lutheran of course they wasn't
[1:36:39] like that in Westland course the shf
[1:36:41] impersonated the Grain and it wasn't the
[1:36:43] grain but we're back to the grain again
[1:36:47] somebody wake up it's not a sign of
[1:36:50] immaturity it's a sign of maturity
[1:36:52] [Applause]
[1:36:56] but the devil wants to take that and
[1:36:57] turn it
[1:36:59] around because men don't get in the
[1:37:02] spirit now he
[1:37:06] said he said you see the
[1:37:09] stone that was rejected is the Chief
[1:37:12] Cornerstone that the building set on and
[1:37:14] he said Jesus was that he was rejected
[1:37:18] and this last day they're going to
[1:37:20] reject the Chief Cornerstone
[1:37:26] and if you remember the Cornerstone for
[1:37:27] your life the Capstone for your
[1:37:30] life is God himself
[1:37:33] love that comes through the baptism of
[1:37:37] the Holy
[1:37:38] Ghost statue of perfect man brother Bram
[1:37:40] did not put the Holy Ghost down here at
[1:37:42] the bottom he put it up here at the
[1:37:45] top we're right here at the top where
[1:37:47] the Capstone and the Holy Ghost must be
[1:37:50] there this is the adopted church people
[1:37:53] who know how to operate in the spirit
[1:37:57] people who get in the
[1:38:00] spirit now again he
[1:38:04] says he said the reason that it was they
[1:38:08] thought they would never need it we
[1:38:09] don't need speaker in tongues we don't
[1:38:11] need interpreters in tongues we don't
[1:38:13] need Old Testament prophets to set us in
[1:38:15] order by the Holy Spirit we understand
[1:38:17] it they've adopted man-made Creed to
[1:38:19] take their place therefore there is a
[1:38:22] people that is elected I believe I'm
[1:38:25] speaking to those this morning that has
[1:38:28] their names on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:38:31] and they can't go for that they are
[1:38:35] spiritual minded and therefore they
[1:38:37] cannot go for that they cannot stand it
[1:38:39] no matter if their fathers and mothers
[1:38:41] has was lived in whatever organizational
[1:38:44] church when the when a church makes does
[1:38:47] maybe it wouldn't speak that out right
[1:38:50] out oh no but they won't speak it right
[1:38:53] out but their actions prove it here's
[1:38:55] the word and the Holy Spirit proves it
[1:38:57] among those when he can get them
[1:38:58] gathered together that he still heals
[1:39:00] the sick and raises the dead and speaks
[1:39:03] with tongues and casts out
[1:39:05] Devils hallelujah amen a church in the
[1:39:10] spirit so you see if the holy spirit is
[1:39:14] going to lead the
[1:39:16] church then it won't be According to
[1:39:18] some ritual of man it'll be by the Bible
[1:39:22] amen
[1:39:24] and you see the church today needs a
[1:39:27] baptism let me just tell you evening
[1:39:29] light Tabernacle needs to get in the
[1:39:34] spirit amen you know we don't need just
[1:39:37] to polish it up no we got a nice
[1:39:39] building we got nice pews we got carpet
[1:39:42] on the floor we have a beautiful place
[1:39:44] we have a wonderful campus amen but what
[1:39:47] we we don't have any needs like that
[1:39:50] what we need is another B baptism of the
[1:39:54] spirit amen we need to get in the spirit
[1:39:59] men and women get in the spirit of God
[1:40:02] know their calling know their
[1:40:05] place now you know this is as I said
[1:40:10] this is why we needed a prophet and not
[1:40:13] a
[1:40:14] theologian that's why today we need
[1:40:16] Spirit field and spirit led men and
[1:40:21] women you see
[1:40:24] brother Bram had some very strong things
[1:40:26] say about it he said you hunt forart and
[1:40:28] see it isn't always the intellectuals
[1:40:31] that are demon-possessed
[1:40:32] think about that and he said worldly
[1:40:36] wisdom is against Christ always and he
[1:40:40] made it clear Jesus didn't tell us to go
[1:40:43] build seminaries he never did it but
[1:40:45] having Bible schools he said preach the
[1:40:48] word preach the gospel and he said these
[1:40:52] signs shall follow them that believe in
[1:40:55] other words he said go demonstrate the
[1:40:57] power of God to All
[1:41:00] Nations amen this is why the message
[1:41:04] cannot be passed on
[1:41:06] intellectually this is why preachers
[1:41:08] must be anointed by the Holy
[1:41:11] Ghost this is why the
[1:41:14] book cannot be revealed to anyone but a
[1:41:18] special class of people people who can
[1:41:21] who can have a prophetic in sight who
[1:41:23] can do like John get in the spirit and
[1:41:27] it will require an ability to hear from
[1:41:30] God if any have an ear well check you
[1:41:32] have two of
[1:41:34] them so that ain't what he's talking
[1:41:37] about he said if anybody's got the
[1:41:39] ability here tell me how that ability
[1:41:41] comes it comes by the Holy Ghost the
[1:41:44] Holy Ghost gives you an ear listen it
[1:41:47] even gives you a
[1:41:49] mind because unless you're born again
[1:41:52] you cannot understand the Kingdom of
[1:41:54] Heaven that's right you cannot
[1:41:56] understand the Holy Ghost so again it
[1:41:59] gives you a mind an understanding it's
[1:42:02] an understanding the world can't give
[1:42:04] that's
[1:42:06] right you see it it doesn't come
[1:42:11] intellectually but a mystery requires
[1:42:14] the teaching of the spirit or it never
[1:42:16] becomes
[1:42:17] clear so he says how we need to hear
[1:42:19] from God and lay ourselves open and
[1:42:21] become yielded to the spirit to he and
[1:42:24] know and I thought you know as I comp
[1:42:28] thought about how this message came
[1:42:31] listen folks it began with the
[1:42:37] supernatural it came with an angel
[1:42:40] stepping out of Dimensions
[1:42:43] unseen and walking a light coming and
[1:42:47] and um and and an angel coming out of
[1:42:50] that light it didn't come in a seminary
[1:42:54] that's right it didn't come by even
[1:42:56] brother Bram going in there and going
[1:42:58] and studying he said now I tell you I
[1:43:00] want to figure this out and figure out
[1:43:01] and I'm going to have a message in the
[1:43:03] last days it didn't come that way it
[1:43:06] came from a supernatural
[1:43:11] encounter amen that's exactly the way
[1:43:13] you are as a Christian you cannot be a
[1:43:16] Christian without a supernatural
[1:43:20] encounter you can be a Christian by name
[1:43:23] but not by by deed by birth unless you
[1:43:27] have a supernatural encounter and this
[1:43:30] message started with the supernatural do
[1:43:32] you know it's going to end the same
[1:43:35] way come on church
[1:43:38] out into that room came a light out of
[1:43:42] that light stepped an angel am then when
[1:43:45] he gave his message he stepped back into
[1:43:47] the light and went out of the
[1:43:50] room it's going to happen the same way
[1:43:53] come on church amen the light will come
[1:43:56] I'm talking about the pillar of fire out
[1:43:58] of it will step
[1:44:00] theophanies come on Amen and they will
[1:44:04] be
[1:44:05] changed glorified those those that
[1:44:08] stepped out will be glorified even our
[1:44:11] theophany oh hallelujah it's going to
[1:44:13] step out of that light and when it does
[1:44:16] it'll come and Unite with us and we will
[1:44:20] step back in that light and off we'll go
[1:44:23] yeah no wonder we'll travel like a
[1:44:26] thought brother Bram said the same thing
[1:44:29] and and Christ revealed his own word he
[1:44:31] said missing people they have them every
[1:44:33] day and missing here missing there he
[1:44:35] said one day you're going to come up and
[1:44:37] Miss he said Mystic lights they are
[1:44:39] seeing Mystic lights here and there he
[1:44:41] said one day a Mystic light is going to
[1:44:43] come down and pick you up and take you
[1:44:45] off hallelujah what happened in the Days
[1:44:48] of Elijah a Mystic light came down and
[1:44:50] and a Char of fire steep come out out of
[1:44:53] that fire and here he stepped in it and
[1:44:55] he went up in the
[1:44:57] Whirlwind sir that's a Rapture then
[1:45:00] that's a Rapture
[1:45:04] now and it will not be
[1:45:07] happening by
[1:45:09] intellect it'll be happening by the
[1:45:13] supernatural somebody who got in the
[1:45:16] spirit oh brother if I'm ever in the
[1:45:19] spirit I want to be in the spirit on
[1:45:21] that day
[1:45:25] yes
[1:45:27] now but then we have the mysteries of
[1:45:32] the Seven Seals you said brother Tim
[1:45:34] what's so important about it well you
[1:45:37] you precious soul don't understand the
[1:45:41] word had been close to
[1:45:43] us it was laid under confusion of mans
[1:45:47] and ideas and this one has this idea
[1:45:51] listen if you tried to search out truth
[1:45:56] there's 40,000 of
[1:45:59] them I'm talking about Christian
[1:46:02] denominations for you to have to search
[1:46:05] out and sort
[1:46:07] out you couldn't do it in a
[1:46:11] lifetime God made it easy and simple for
[1:46:15] you amen you don't have to argue over
[1:46:18] well what school did you come from where
[1:46:20] where's your preacher from was he from
[1:46:23] this one or was he from that one where
[1:46:25] did he get his credential I like the has
[1:46:27] this credential I like it don't matter
[1:46:31] all of them are
[1:46:32] man-made God gave his
[1:46:34] credentials amen he Vindicated it with a
[1:46:37] pillar of fire he showed signs and
[1:46:40] wonders to show
[1:46:42] us this is my
[1:46:50] voice so it'll go out west he'll meet
[1:46:52] with seven
[1:46:53] angels guess what they didn't come from
[1:46:57] from a school they come from the
[1:47:02] Supernatural and they came like a speed
[1:47:05] of light he said into into this
[1:47:08] Dimension caught me up in
[1:47:11] it one place he said they throw a sword
[1:47:14] in my
[1:47:20] hand gave me a message send me back to
[1:47:24] the
[1:47:25] East and told me that the the the the
[1:47:29] the Seven
[1:47:31] Seals that that that day the Seven Seals
[1:47:35] would be revealed and he said I I went
[1:47:37] in that
[1:47:39] room and he said I I was going back my
[1:47:43] own old
[1:47:46] thoughts and I was relying I don't know
[1:47:49] anything better than to do I called this
[1:47:52] meeting I don't know what these seals
[1:47:53] are but here's something I studied out
[1:47:56] years ago and I came to these
[1:47:58] conclusions and I preached
[1:48:01] this and he said I was about to make a
[1:48:05] horrible
[1:48:07] mistake but about that time he came in
[1:48:10] the room I got in the spirit and when I
[1:48:13] got in the spirit he revealed to me I
[1:48:17] heard the voice of Thunder I heard the
[1:48:21] voice that had been silenced I heard the
[1:48:23] voice of God revealed to me the
[1:48:27] mystery and now we no longer look and
[1:48:30] see a symbol in the Bible we know who it
[1:48:33] is we know it was the Antichrist we know
[1:48:36] his advancement come on the book has
[1:48:39] been open
[1:48:42] why because somebody got in the
[1:48:45] spirit thank you Lord that's right Amen
[1:48:49] brother Bram would come to the fifth
[1:48:50] seal and he said them revelations in the
[1:48:54] presence of that ball of fire hanging
[1:48:56] there in the room oh my seven spirits of
[1:49:00] God from one Holy Spirit revealing seven
[1:49:04] manifestation bringing seven voices
[1:49:06] revealing giving seven interpretation to
[1:49:09] Seven
[1:49:14] Seals
[1:49:15] Hallelujah where did that come from how
[1:49:19] can we have confidence in
[1:49:21] it because God backed it
[1:49:25] up amen because God was his own
[1:49:28] interpreter because we heard from the
[1:49:32] spirit
[1:49:34] amen
[1:49:36] amen now speaking of
[1:49:39] that as we as we see and we know now
[1:49:44] we're no longer in the time of
[1:49:47] Silence the Silence has been
[1:49:49] broken the end time has been revealed it
[1:49:53] is all started in process we're no
[1:49:56] longer waiting for a prophet to come and
[1:49:59] tell us what it is he's come
[1:50:03] right but now are you in the spirit of
[1:50:08] it come on is it just a message and it
[1:50:11] didn't get you in the spirit or did a
[1:50:14] message get you in the
[1:50:16] spirit what is happening now look I'm
[1:50:20] just going to say as you notice my title
[1:50:23] put it up here for a moment you saw my
[1:50:26] title of getting in the
[1:50:28] spirit I'm speaking of mountain movers
[1:50:31] the mountain movers getting in the
[1:50:33] spirit why in the world would you
[1:50:35] combine these two thoughts together
[1:50:37] because you're going to have to be in
[1:50:38] the spirit to move a
[1:50:40] mountain that's
[1:50:43] right it's going to have to be God
[1:50:46] speaking through you because man's word
[1:50:48] cannot move a mountain only God can move
[1:50:51] a mountain
[1:50:53] right so after me deity move in the
[1:50:56] mountain you know good and well you can
[1:50:58] stand up there and hollered all day long
[1:51:00] all you want to and it ain't going to
[1:51:02] move but I tell you what if you'd ever
[1:51:04] get in the spirit once and the spirit
[1:51:07] speak through you come on you think that
[1:51:09] was brother Bram when he spoke squirrels
[1:51:11] into existence when he resurrected the
[1:51:13] little fish when he when he when he
[1:51:15] spoke to hady right children but when he
[1:51:17] spoke to tumor out of his wife when when
[1:51:19] he did that spoke to the storm do you
[1:51:21] think that was brother him no God said
[1:51:25] speak
[1:51:26] it it was somebody in tune with God it
[1:51:30] was somebody who could hear the voice of
[1:51:32] God you say brother Tim that was a
[1:51:34] prophet but you're a prophetical class
[1:51:36] of people you're a people who ought to
[1:51:39] be in tune with the voice of
[1:51:46] god let's just take it down to Moses for
[1:51:49] a moment Moses could not fulfill the
[1:51:53] prophecy written of
[1:51:54] him he could not feel fulfill the
[1:51:58] prophecy written of him even though it
[1:52:00] was in the word of
[1:52:03] God God
[1:52:05] said your people so Jour in a Strange
[1:52:08] Land for 400 years and after that with a
[1:52:10] mighty hand I'll bring them out the word
[1:52:13] had
[1:52:16] said now we have the prophecy but we
[1:52:19] need the spirit on the prophecy
[1:52:23] come on Amen we got the man but we need
[1:52:27] the spirit on the
[1:52:29] man the man with the prophecy without
[1:52:32] the spirit ain't going to do any good
[1:52:33] the prophecy without the spirit ain't
[1:52:35] going to come to
[1:52:37] life come on Amen so what does God do
[1:52:41] you know I mean Moses tried to move this
[1:52:44] mountain that's right he went out and
[1:52:46] killed an Egyptian I'll lead them out
[1:52:49] I'll show them how to do it kill your
[1:52:50] oppressors kill them this Egyptian that
[1:52:53] was that was Overlord and being being uh
[1:52:57] mean to to one of one of the Israelites
[1:52:59] and he killed
[1:53:00] him buried
[1:53:03] him I'll show you how to do it we'll
[1:53:06] move this mountain one by
[1:53:09] one start a rebellion here we'll rise up
[1:53:13] we'll we'll overthrow this Kingdom time
[1:53:15] to throw this out didn't work did it
[1:53:23] he ran off
[1:53:25] defeated but God you said in your word
[1:53:27] yeah I did but you didn't get in the
[1:53:29] spirit
[1:53:31] Moses you tried to do this in your own
[1:53:36] self you never met the pillar of fire
[1:53:40] Moses you are trying this you're trying
[1:53:43] to make prophecy come to pass you're
[1:53:46] trying to fulfill
[1:53:47] scripture without the power to do it
[1:53:51] right you got to get in the spirit Moses
[1:53:55] that's right well Moses gets out and he
[1:53:57] soaks for about 40 years out there and
[1:53:59] his brother bradam said it took 40 years
[1:54:01] to to get out of Moses all the stuff
[1:54:05] that's right that had been taught to
[1:54:08] him until he finally you know it was
[1:54:11] through it was over with and he's out on
[1:54:14] the backside the
[1:54:16] desert amen and here now the prophecy
[1:54:20] meets the prophet but this time with a
[1:54:22] pillar of
[1:54:24] fire now brother Brenham said killing an
[1:54:27] Egyptian one dead Egyptian he said
[1:54:29] that's about all that we have done with
[1:54:33] the gospel he said is killed one dead
[1:54:37] Egyptian maybe make a man live true to
[1:54:39] his wife you know maybe he quit stealing
[1:54:43] or doing something listen church I I I'm
[1:54:46] happy for every person that gets
[1:54:48] reformed makes better neighbors nicer
[1:54:51] people
[1:54:53] amen amen but but really that ain't what
[1:54:55] it's all about it's not about a
[1:54:58] Reformation it's a transformation it's
[1:55:01] where God comes down and eradicates
[1:55:05] sin from the
[1:55:08] life amen now Moses couldn't feel that
[1:55:12] fulfill that prophecy even though it was
[1:55:14] the word of God even though his mother
[1:55:16] others had told him he was sin of God
[1:55:18] you're a special child look you were
[1:55:20] saved as a as a kid that's a that's a
[1:55:24] lot of
[1:55:26] problems we we get baptized when we're
[1:55:28] young people and we're saved and we're
[1:55:31] going to heaven and you never met the
[1:55:33] pillar of
[1:55:36] fire well I've been baptized and I go to
[1:55:38] message church and I'm in no you're not
[1:55:42] you got the prophecy and maybe you're
[1:55:44] the predestined but the predestine and
[1:55:47] the prophecy has to come together in the
[1:55:49] pillar of
[1:55:50] fire you got to meet
[1:55:54] God Amen so you see Moses could not
[1:55:57] fulfill the prophecy written from him of
[1:56:00] him even though he tried even though it
[1:56:02] was the word even though he had others
[1:56:05] tell him you know listen you're the one
[1:56:08] you're predestinated what do we tell you
[1:56:10] over here you're predestinated you are
[1:56:12] called you are chosen you're elected
[1:56:15] you're going to be
[1:56:17] there but if you don't meet the pillar
[1:56:19] of fire you'll never be there
[1:56:29] and that's what's being left
[1:56:31] out that Encounter of getting in the
[1:56:36] spirit and we can tell you all day long
[1:56:38] you're called to be a part of the Bride
[1:56:40] that you're here to Tire down Satan's
[1:56:42] kingdom and it's true but you can't do
[1:56:49] it no more than Moses good
[1:56:53] amen you see the pillar of
[1:56:56] fire had what Moses lacked that's right
[1:57:01] he had the word without the spirit yeah
[1:57:05] well it's the word brother it's the word
[1:57:07] yes it's the word but if you don't have
[1:57:09] the spirit as brother bam said it's
[1:57:11] gasoline but it might as well be water
[1:57:14] cuz you don't have a
[1:57:19] spark so delivering the Israelites from
[1:57:21] Egypt bondage and taken in the promised
[1:57:23] land that was Moses
[1:57:29] Mountain that was huge
[1:57:31] mountain getting them people that had
[1:57:33] been rooted in there for 400
[1:57:37] years can
[1:57:39] you how many how many have got Irish
[1:57:42] background let me see your hands Irish
[1:57:45] well real high as I can see oh yeah well
[1:57:47] I've got a good number all right so we
[1:57:50] have Irish background how long you've
[1:57:53] been here well at least maybe 1002 200
[1:57:55] years let's go back to
[1:57:59] Ireland
[1:58:02] what I don't even know that
[1:58:05] place I don't even know I don't know
[1:58:08] it's it's I'm not in love with it
[1:58:11] valleys and it and it's whatever and you
[1:58:13] know I me go back to I'm not going there
[1:58:18] that was the Jews that were down in
[1:58:20] Egypt this is home
[1:58:23] you know just get us a better Pharaoh
[1:58:25] you know give get us a better president
[1:58:28] we can just stay here a little
[1:58:32] longer you know you know you know what
[1:58:36] leave
[1:58:38] here leave here and go to a Promised
[1:58:42] Land you see this was Moses
[1:58:45] Mountain first of all getting the people
[1:58:47] willing to
[1:58:49] go secondly getting them to believing
[1:58:52] they
[1:58:54] could amen and the only way that they
[1:58:56] could believe they could was when God
[1:58:58] showed signs and wonders and brought
[1:59:00] plagues on Satan's kingdom somebody
[1:59:02] don't close the book I'm
[1:59:04] preaching amen here it is that you see
[1:59:08] they were right there and the and the
[1:59:10] only thing that would do
[1:59:14] it to move this mountain Moses need to
[1:59:18] do one
[1:59:20] thing meet the Pillar of
[1:59:23] Fire and when he met the pillar of fire
[1:59:26] what he couldn't do with an army he did
[1:59:29] it with a
[1:59:31] stick you see it don't take a lot once
[1:59:35] that you
[1:59:37] get in the
[1:59:39] spirit because only by the spirit can
[1:59:42] you move this mountain you see when you
[1:59:45] get in the spirit and you step in the
[1:59:47] Holy Ghost and he shine his light upon
[1:59:50] the word then the impossible becomes
[1:59:53] little things that's right to get the
[1:59:56] bride in the
[1:59:58] Rapture that's our
[2:00:04] Mountain
[2:00:05] amen amen and to do it it's going to
[2:00:08] take getting in the
[2:00:10] spirit
[2:00:12] amen you already have the word you're
[2:00:16] already told you're called elected
[2:00:17] chosen predestinated placed somebody
[2:00:21] help me
[2:00:23] amen you already been all of that you
[2:00:25] know you you got a uh all of this but we
[2:00:28] got to get in the spirit you see and
[2:00:31] when you get in the spirit The
[2:00:33] Impossible becomes
[2:00:35] little see to get the bride in the
[2:00:38] Rapture it takes getting in the spirit
[2:00:41] now and of course you know things happen
[2:00:45] in our day to generate Faith stimulate
[2:00:49] faith that Gifts of healing that was
[2:00:52] added to the church and when and brother
[2:00:54] Bram said to that when but now when I'm
[2:00:57] gone healing isn't gone healing ought to
[2:01:00] be more than it was before we
[2:01:05] come that's what I want to say even to
[2:01:08] the message Community today friend when
[2:01:11] brother bradam left healing didn't
[2:01:13] leave amen no we had a gift to stimulate
[2:01:17] Faith but we have no excuse not to
[2:01:20] believe we we know the impossible
[2:01:21] possible has been done amen so healing
[2:01:24] ought to be more than before brother
[2:01:26] Bram came that's right and brother
[2:01:30] bradam said this remember this when I'm
[2:01:34] gone and if you'll check he's been gone
[2:01:37] nearly 60 years when I'm gone Jesus will
[2:01:42] still be
[2:01:46] here and when I'm not in your
[2:01:49] church Christ will be there just to
[2:01:54] name amen oh I wonder if some of those
[2:01:58] who are just depending on one day when
[2:02:00] brother Brandon comes back I wonder if
[2:02:01] they can get a hold of that would that
[2:02:04] when I'm gone Jesus will still be here
[2:02:07] there ought to be more healings after I
[2:02:09] leave than what it was before I
[2:02:12] come that ought to be our testimony
[2:02:14] today amen oh but you see the devil has
[2:02:18] sent down his troops in the latter days
[2:02:20] but you see the men ministers hadn't got
[2:02:23] the people in the spirit of the last
[2:02:25] days they hadn't got them into the
[2:02:27] spirit of the open book where that they
[2:02:30] realize then all the promises of God are
[2:02:32] true and real and for us that believe
[2:02:36] that's amen that's why I'm telling you
[2:02:38] we need to get in the spirit more than
[2:02:41] ever
[2:02:42] anointed you see in in every church
[2:02:46] service you know Paul said I'll sing in

[2:04:35] spirit
[2:04:38] Amen brother bradam told us he said
[2:04:40] music plays a big part of that and he
[2:04:43] tells of a prophet One Day by the name
[2:04:45] of elij they got all out of out of sorts
[2:04:49] because there was a man a king come up
[2:04:51] there wanting wanting a word from God
[2:04:53] wanting help from God and he had been a
[2:04:57] rebellious
[2:04:59] Pagan and he said you you're you're

[2:05:13] for Jehoshaphat this righteous man I
[2:05:16] wouldn't even give you
[2:05:18] audience that's why but he's talking to
[2:05:20] the King right but he's giving him a a
[2:05:23] dress
[2:05:25] down he's all stirred up and angry about
[2:05:29] everything and they need a word from God
[2:05:31] and he said wasn't for Jehoshaphat I
[2:05:33] wouldn't give you an audience but

[2:06:00] time it was a modern song for the time
[2:06:03] and he was singing it you know he said
[2:06:05] he got to singing one of them old

[2:07:12] get out of that out of sorts

[2:12:25] unique way of coming to

[2:12:34] saw her rise up of a vice president or
[2:12:37] president as brother bam said we also
[2:12:40] already saw another Catholic President

[2:13:12] prophecy has a unique way of coming to
[2:13:14] pass it will come to pass and you will
[2:13:17] not even know
[2:13:20] it Eddie bisco's green shirt don't even
[2:13:22] know he has a green shirt told her to
[2:13:23] get rid of the green shirt you know
[2:13:25] don't pack that I don't want it throw it
[2:13:27] away and she repaired it and put in the
[2:13:28] in the in
[2:13:29] the in his
[2:13:35] luggage didn't know he was the man till
[2:13:39] he steps into the vision wasn't even
[2:13:41] then probably when he put it on he say
[2:13:44] hey I've got the green shirt no it would
[2:13:46] be pointed out to him here it
[2:13:48] is here it is
[2:13:51] now that Grizzly is going to be right we
[2:13:53] got the Caribou it'll be right there
[2:13:54] how's it going to be there I don't know
[2:13:56] I can see his far doesn't matter he's
[2:13:58] Jehova Gyra he can he can produce one
[2:14:01] right
[2:14:04] there amen and the next moment well my
[2:14:07] goodness it's somebody's milk
[2:14:13] cow you see has a lot to do it I mean
[2:14:16] the Forerunner we know was John the
[2:14:19] Baptist he was to come and trees would
[2:14:22] clap their hands and and and high places
[2:14:24] be made low and Low Places be made High
[2:14:27] you know rough places made made smooth
[2:14:30] and when he came and they were in the
[2:14:33] vision most of them never realized
[2:14:35] that's right never even knew who he was
[2:14:39] they didn't realize a vision was being
[2:14:41] fulfilled Isaiah's prophecy was being
[2:14:45] fulfilled in a wild man down there with
[2:14:48] a with a beard and and and an old old
[2:14:51] camel skin garment and and eaten
[2:14:54] honeycomb and honeycomb and and
[2:14:57] grasshoppers or
[2:15:00] locusts didn't know this man this simple
[2:15:04] man was the Fulfillment of it and it
[2:15:07] happened and the whole world the whole
[2:15:10] Jewish World missed it and he introduced
[2:15:14] the Messiah and the whole gener
[2:15:16] generation of Israelites crucified him
[2:15:19] that's right right
[2:15:22] yes and yet hundreds of prophecies were
[2:15:25] taken place while he hung on the cross
[2:15:28] and there they was spitting on the
[2:15:34] prophecy he was supposed to be virgin
[2:15:36] born and when he come a he's
[2:15:39] illegitimate his mother had an affair
[2:15:41] they covered it
[2:15:43] up anything good come out of Nazareth
[2:15:45] how could he be he can't be a Nazarene
[2:15:52] he's got to come out of
[2:15:54] Bethlehem every way they looked you know
[2:15:57] they he can't be the Messiah he doesn't
[2:15:58] measure up you know it it it ain't him
[2:16:01] it ain't it ain't him they were in
[2:16:04] denial amen well this couldn't be a
[2:16:07] woman I'm not saying the woman I'm not
[2:16:09] saying it was I'm just
[2:16:11] saying the damage may already be done
[2:16:14] that's
[2:16:16] right so what are you going to
[2:16:19] do and instead of
[2:16:22] relaxing becoming lukewarm I'm going to
[2:16:25] get in the
[2:16:29] spirit that's what I'm going to do what
[2:16:32] are you going to do brother Tim uhuh I
[2:16:35] ain't folding my hands up and saying ah
[2:16:38] I ain't nothing happening yet we can go
[2:16:41] back to sleep false
[2:16:42] alarm I am what I'm going to do is say
[2:16:46] I'm going to be
[2:16:48] anointed I am anointed for this power
[2:16:51] for this reason I have come I'm here in
[2:16:54] this generation am I'm going to get in
[2:16:56] the spirit so I can see
[2:17:00] things because when I get in the spirit
[2:17:03] then I can see he's present he's Among
[2:17:05] Us it's the son of man he's among the
[2:17:07] church ages he's still here he hadn't
[2:17:09] left us
[2:17:13] right you
[2:17:15] see to get the bride ready he'll take
[2:17:18] getting in the spirit
[2:17:21] it takes the word but it takes the
[2:17:23] spirit to bring the word Jesus knew them
[2:17:29] that of his disciples they had walked
[2:17:31] with him now for three and a half years
[2:17:32] of
[2:17:33] ministry and he knew they needed power
[2:17:36] for
[2:17:37] service this why he told him that now
[2:17:39] don't you go don't you go anywhere else
[2:17:42] you go to Jerusalem don't you go
[2:17:45] preach listen oh well we're going to go
[2:17:48] tell them you rose from the dead we saw
[2:17:50] you
[2:17:51] sin we we we we going we got a message
[2:17:54] no you can't
[2:17:56] preach you cannot preach oh but he's
[2:18:00] risen but you can't
[2:18:04] preach
[2:18:06] what we can't preach no not until you're
[2:18:10] endued with power from on
[2:18:12] high otherwise it's just going to be
[2:18:16] it's just going to be
[2:18:18] nonsense it's not going to have life in
[2:18:20] it it'll never produce anything but get
[2:18:23] there in the upper room until the spirit
[2:18:27] comes and when the spirit comes then you
[2:18:30] will really be
[2:18:32] Witnesses because you will be talking
[2:18:35] about my resurrection you'll be talking
[2:18:37] about your
[2:18:38] resurrection that you were dead and sins
[2:18:41] and trespasses but now you are
[2:18:48] alive many people are preaching about
[2:18:50] the resurrection but they never had a
[2:18:56] resurrection you see to be qualified as
[2:18:58] a witness you have to have an
[2:19:01] experience you can't be a witness using
[2:19:03] somebody else's testimony you had to
[2:19:06] experience that I was
[2:19:09] there well so and so told me so and so
[2:19:12] said you're not a
[2:19:14] witness that does not qualify as a
[2:19:17] witness when you when you are when you
[2:19:20] when you are a witness it happened to
[2:19:23] you you saw it you experienced it amen
[2:19:27] it was part of your life amen they had
[2:19:31] they had to to witness that not only he
[2:19:34] had he died and buried but that he had
[2:19:37] come
[2:19:38] again you see this qualification was to
[2:19:42] be the coming of the promised Holy
[2:19:44] Spirit to fill the church with
[2:19:47] unction and the word unction is
[2:19:50] anointing
[2:19:51] it's a power the Bible said and you
[2:19:53] shall receive power that word power
[2:19:57] comes from the Greek word where we get
[2:19:59] our word
[2:20:00] Dynamite it's an
[2:20:06] explosion when we step in the light of
[2:20:08] God's word with the unction of the Holy
[2:20:10] Spirit to shine the light on it then the
[2:20:12] impossible becomes little
[2:20:16] things forms of godliness denying the
[2:20:19] power you go to church but never getting
[2:20:20] the spirit no power no spirit and God
[2:20:25] hates a powerless
[2:20:31] religion power is not emotion NE is
[2:20:34] neither is the Holy Ghost
[2:20:37] emotion but it comes with
[2:20:41] it it was not the emotion there other
[2:20:44] people ran people there on the day of
[2:20:46] Pentecost other people
[2:20:48] ran shouted but they were run running
[2:20:53] away strange things
[2:20:56] happening someone was running away to
[2:20:59] tell the priest tell this and tell that
[2:21:03] one they didn't have the
[2:21:06] experience but you see he could not send
[2:21:09] the church out till it first got in the
[2:21:13] spirit amen did tell you see you see
[2:21:17] brother bradam was was told by doctor
[2:21:19] one time uh and the doctor said hey
[2:21:22] these guys he said they're running to
[2:21:24] the altar he said you know what's the
[2:21:25] matter with them they're just worked up
[2:21:27] you worked them up brother
[2:21:29] Brandon you know they're act they're
[2:21:31] acting like that crying and running the
[2:21:33] altar it's just
[2:21:34] emotion brother Brandon said Doctor you
[2:21:36] ought to know enough it takes something
[2:21:38] to excite the nerves before that a
[2:21:40] person could be emotional it's something
[2:21:42] present and it's true that when the Holy
[2:21:44] Ghost come down it stirs the crowd to
[2:21:46] motion they're sitting there Anointed
[2:21:48] with the spirit of God and the Holy
[2:21:50] Spirit sweeps across them it stirs
[2:21:53] emotion it's got
[2:21:56] to amen when you realize when your eyes
[2:22:00] come open when you get in the spirit and
[2:22:03] you realize Jesus is coming by you're
[2:22:06] going to wave your
[2:22:07] palms come on now you're going to say
[2:22:10] hosana to the son of David if you don't
[2:22:13] the rocks will cry
[2:22:16] out amen cuz when the spirit of God is
[2:22:20] there there's liberty
[2:22:24] amen well brother Tim but that that's
[2:22:26] not the way it happens here because it's
[2:22:28] forms of
[2:22:30] godliness which denies the
[2:22:33] power there's no you know it's like
[2:22:35] drinking cocacola you let it sit out and
[2:22:39] lose all the Fizz I pour it down the
[2:22:41] sink that's right I don't want it if it
[2:22:44] don't have the
[2:22:47] zip amen I'm going to say the same thing
[2:22:49] I don't care what preaching I don't want
[2:22:51] it if it don't have the
[2:22:53] zip if the spirit ain't moving in it if
[2:22:56] it ain't quickening in the Heart come on
[2:22:58] I don't want it it's failed something
[2:23:01] another that was left over from some
[2:23:03] other time I don't need it I don't want
[2:23:06] it it ain't no good have all you want of
[2:23:09] it but what I want I want something with
[2:23:12] life with power in
[2:23:15] it you know if there's anything the
[2:23:17] devil would like to do he'd like to he
[2:23:19] would like to accompl is prevent the new
[2:23:22] birth if he can cram down the church
[2:23:26] spiritual birth control
[2:23:29] Theology and keep her from bringing
[2:23:31] forth live births he will do
[2:23:34] it if he can just keep the church from
[2:23:38] reproducing with live births there'll be
[2:23:40] no Sons and Daughters of God born and no
[2:23:42] one to operate in the realm of the Holy
[2:23:45] Ghost and no one to cast him
[2:23:48] out so he want have anything to fear and
[2:23:52] you know our prophet of God warned us
[2:23:54] over and again about stillborn
[2:23:57] babies he even brought it right down to
[2:24:00] birth pains when he was preaching there
[2:24:02] in his one of his Easter sermons one of
[2:24:04] the last sermons that God would impart
[2:24:06] to us in this age by the seventh angel
[2:24:09] and he would bring it out still born
[2:24:12] babies and he said if a baby is born and
[2:24:15] it doesn't have life if it doesn't
[2:24:18] Squall out and unknown tongues to itself
[2:24:21] or something he said it's it's born dead
[2:24:25] and he said this is what we have
[2:24:27] produced is a lot of still born
[2:24:30] babies we got to have
[2:24:33] life
[2:24:34] amen when you have people who are church
[2:24:37] members who still smoke do drugs alcohol
[2:24:41] fornicate adultery
[2:24:44] divorcing they come from a
[2:24:46] hen but not from the
[2:24:49] mate that's right
[2:24:51] hello the hen can set him brother bradam
[2:24:54] you used the illustration over and over
[2:24:55] my H can do a good job sitting on the
[2:24:59] eggs sitting on the egg she's trying
[2:25:02] she's trying but if she hadn't been with
[2:25:04] the
[2:25:05] mate none of them's going to
[2:25:08] hatch that's the same thing these
[2:25:10] Concepts friends were taught all the way
[2:25:12] through the message that's brother Bron
[2:25:15] talked about himself he said going out
[2:25:17] he said as a Rancher he said I learned
[2:25:20] you know hey a cat would be born and and
[2:25:23] yet he had to be marked we had to know
[2:25:25] who he was so what we would do is get a
[2:25:28] fire real hot stick a Brandon iron in it
[2:25:30] tie him down and stick a hot iron to him
[2:25:33] I've seen it done I've been a part of it
[2:25:36] even on our farm where we did things
[2:25:38] like that and you take it there and he
[2:25:41] said man he said that calf was Squall
[2:25:44] and yell and kick and you let him loose
[2:25:47] he'd jump up and raise his tail and race
[2:25:50] AC cross and had throw a big fit but he
[2:25:52] knew who he was from then
[2:25:54] on and he said that's the way it is with
[2:25:57] the church you get the Holy Ghost and
[2:25:59] you get branded by the Holy Ghost and
[2:26:01] sealed unto the day of redemption you'll
[2:26:05] cry and you'll scream and you'll yell
[2:26:07] and you'll jump and and you'll holler
[2:26:10] but you'll know who you
[2:26:11] are amen you'll know you don't belong to
[2:26:14] the devil anymore Hallelujah that you're
[2:26:17] a Son of God because you've been born of
[2:26:19] the spirit
[2:26:23] but that's the reason we've got so many
[2:26:25] cold formal churches
[2:26:27] today that don't even believe the sign
[2:26:29] shall follow them to believe because why
[2:26:31] they've never been with the
[2:26:33] mate oh yeah yeah oh yeah we're going to
[2:26:36] have a prayer line listen I I watched a
[2:26:38] prayer line here here here just I've got
[2:26:40] it I've got it watched a prayer line
[2:26:43] here the other day sometime ago was sent
[2:26:45] to me of a of a brother one of the
[2:26:47] principal leaders in this country so
[2:26:49] we're going to have have a prayer line
[2:26:50] now you know you know this is not the
[2:26:53] season for miracles and you know that
[2:26:55] was for another day whatever but we're
[2:26:57] going to have a prayer line you know
[2:26:59] because whatever and but we don't get
[2:27:01] the Holy Ghost today you know there
[2:27:04] Gentiles like they did in the book of
[2:27:08] Acts because you see with there in the
[2:27:10] upper room that was Jews and the Jews
[2:27:13] got the Holy Ghost and they spake with
[2:27:15] tongues and and they they uh had the
[2:27:18] moving of the spirit upon but with the
[2:27:20] Gentiles while Peter spake these words
[2:27:24] the Holy Ghost came on them that believ
[2:27:27] so you know that's the way it is today
[2:27:29] we we just get it when we receive the
[2:27:31] word if you believe the message you got
[2:27:34] the Holy Ghost you see so you don't need
[2:27:36] that because that was for the Jews and
[2:27:38] we are Gentile why don't you read your
[2:27:41] Bible amen so they come down and they
[2:27:43] baptized them Peter and John did come on
[2:27:46] in the name of Jesus Christ after having
[2:27:49] believed on the Lord amen and what they
[2:27:52] said these have received the Holy Ghost
[2:27:55] just like we did at the beginning
[2:27:58] because we heard them speak in tongues
[2:28:00] and
[2:28:02] prophesy you know people don't even know
[2:28:04] their Bible
[2:28:07] anymore you see again because again you
[2:28:12] see this is what has caused so
[2:28:14] many stillborn babies you see a real
[2:28:18] birth is a meth
[2:28:23] this is another concept I'm I'm
[2:28:25] preaching you message Concepts over and
[2:28:27] over and over again that brother brandom
[2:28:30] emphasized you say he said he even in
[2:28:34] birth pains he said oh people give into
[2:28:37] my
[2:28:38] message just as he talked about
[2:28:40] stillborn baby my message you see a real
[2:28:43] message produces life
[2:28:50] but he said yeah people don't want to
[2:28:52] take it because of their style their
[2:28:53] pride I see it creeping to us
[2:28:55] Pentecostal people little pride we don't
[2:28:57] want to do it I don't want to get down
[2:28:59] to that alter and boohoo but let me tell
[2:29:01] you he said I birth is a mess I don't
[2:29:04] care where it's at if it's in a house of
[2:29:06] barn pink decorated hospital room a
[2:29:09] birth is a mess and a new birth is a
[2:29:10] mess and you can't come up starchy and
[2:29:12] say I've received Christ as my personal
[2:29:15] savior
[2:29:17] nonsense get down there at the altar and
[2:29:19] stay there till you're born again it's a
[2:29:21] mess and it but it brings life I don't
[2:29:23] care what scale or level I have to come
[2:29:26] to amen he goes on to say he said stay
[2:29:30] until you get in the
[2:29:33] spirit that's what's wrong with a lot of
[2:29:36] our prayers we're going through the
[2:29:37] motion but we never get in the
[2:29:44] spirit watch now he brings it around
[2:29:47] like this a chick in the shell
[2:29:51] it's there in the Shell he said you
[2:29:53] can't help it out this is what's
[2:29:56] happened that's what killed a lot of
[2:29:58] children in the message you believe the
[2:30:00] message you got the Holy Ghost but you
[2:30:02] know I I I still am living what just
[2:30:06] grow a little just grow a little you'll

[2:30:31] you get in the
[2:30:38] spirit you know Church you don't
[2:30:41] understand as I deal with Ministry and

[2:31:41] ain't no reason I can do that can help
[2:31:43] him man all the talking to that I give
[2:31:46] him and advice I give him ain't going to
[2:31:48] do a thing for him
[2:31:50] I can counsel with him and talk to him
[2:31:52] use psychology on him and give him
[2:31:54] behavioral lessons and say now you do
[2:31:56] this when this happen it ain't going to
[2:31:58] happen it ain't going to
[2:32:00] help I said he needs to be born again he
[2:32:03] needs the Holy Ghost he said oh no no
[2:32:05] brother Tim you don't understand he has
[2:32:07] the Holy Ghost he's been a member here
[2:32:09] for years and years and he has the Holy
[2:32:11] Ghost I said what he has the Holy Ghost
[2:32:13] yeah he believes the message I said
[2:32:18] what you believe he believes the message
[2:32:21] and he has the Holy Ghost and he's got
[2:32:23] sin in his life I said he don't have the
[2:32:25] Holy Ghost I said it's
[2:32:28] impossible you can't do that and have
[2:32:31] the spirit of God he's never been in the
[2:32:34] spirit well find out when I did find out
[2:32:36] who he was you know you go to preaching
[2:32:38] he would be one of the loudest amers in
[2:32:40] the church you know a lot of people
[2:32:41] think if I say Amen to the word brother
[2:32:44] that shows I've got the spirit that
[2:32:45] ain't the spirit that's acknowledging
[2:32:47] the word is true that's right that's
[2:32:50] just agreeing with it but if you really
[2:32:52] agree with it you'll live
[2:32:54] it come
[2:32:56] on Amen it's like I talked to a young
[2:32:59] man the other day and I met him out at
[2:33:01] at a place and and and and he got about
[2:33:05] 10 ft from me I was he had a dog that
[2:33:07] was in his arms and was barking and
[2:33:09] going on and was trying to nip me and I
[2:33:11] didn't want to get too close to him so
[2:33:13] kept my distance from him and he was
[2:33:16] talking to me and and and he said uh
[2:33:19] brother Tim he said I I love the Lord I
[2:33:22] said well I I'm sure glad he said yeah
[2:33:25] he said I I believe in him I said that's
[2:33:29] wonderful I can smell cigarettes on
[2:33:33] him that far
[2:33:37] away I knew as we talked he'd been the
[2:33:40] hardies and drinking and
[2:33:42] drugs but I love
[2:33:46] Jesus but but I I I believe in God I
[2:33:50] believe the Bible brother
[2:33:52] listen you don't
[2:33:54] believe until you're changed you're just
[2:33:58] saying you believe you're agreeing in
[2:34:02] the concepts but real belief comes when
[2:34:06] the Holy Ghost
[2:34:09] comes so you know again this man you
[2:34:12] know saying to me oh brother Tim but but
[2:34:15] I tell you what this man does have the
[2:34:17] Holy Ghost I said he can't have the Holy
[2:34:19] Ghost not didn't live like that he
[2:34:22] said well I said the Holy Ghost is an
[2:34:25] experience it changes your life he said
[2:34:28] well what about those who don't have the
[2:34:29] Holy Ghost and don't know it I said what
[2:34:33] we have the Holy Ghost today and don't
[2:34:36] know
[2:34:37] it the Bible said that that day you
[2:34:39] shall
[2:34:41] know that I'm the father and the father
[2:34:44] me and the and I am
[2:34:46] you right come on
[2:34:50] you will know it's it's an experience it
[2:34:53] happens to you I said sure I I would
[2:34:56] understand somebody said that you know
[2:34:57] they' been taught the tongues was the
[2:34:59] Holy Ghost and and speaking in tongues
[2:35:01] was the evidence and they had never
[2:35:04] never spoken tongues and they were
[2:35:06] confused on that point I could
[2:35:08] understand they could have the Holy
[2:35:09] Ghost and had and have it and had not
[2:35:11] spoken tongues because they was looking
[2:35:12] for that as an Evidence they thought
[2:35:14] that was it I don't have it cuz I didn't
[2:35:16] speak in tongues I said it was mistaught
[2:35:19] but
[2:35:24] sin listen church I've been around the
