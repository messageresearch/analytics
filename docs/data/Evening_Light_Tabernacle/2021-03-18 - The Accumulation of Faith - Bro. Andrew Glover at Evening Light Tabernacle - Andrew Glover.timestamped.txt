[42:06] in the message and that's not
[42:08] not nice to do now that we believe the
[42:10] message but whatever brother branham had
[42:11] in about 1963 it cost him to almost wake
[42:14] up a neighborhood

[44:35] lord has for us tonight in the word amen
[44:38] in psalms 102 and verse 16
[44:41] the bible here says when the lord
[44:44] shall build up zion he shall appear
[44:48] in his glory we could say when the lord
[44:51] shall build up his bride
[44:53] he shall appear in his glory i love that
[44:56] word
[44:57] build up when the lord shall build up
[44:59] zion
[45:00] he shall appear in his glory in the book

[45:04] chapter jude the first chapter
[45:07] i want to look there in the 17th verse
[45:09] of jude 1.
[45:10] how many thanks to the lord for the
[45:12] reading of the word of god tonight
[45:14] amen jude chapter 1
[45:18] and verse number 17
[45:21] the bible here says but beloved
[45:24] remember ye the words which were spoken
[45:27] before
[45:28] of the apostles of our lord jesus christ
[45:31] how that they told you there should be
[45:33] markers in the last time
[45:35] who should walk after their own ungodly
[45:38] lust
[45:39] these be they who have separated
[45:40] themselves central
[45:42] having not the spirit but ye beloved
[45:46] i'm glad we're not those other verses
[45:47] we're in this verse
[45:49] but ye beloved building up yourselves
[45:53] on your most holy faith praying in the
[45:56] holy ghost
[45:57] keep yourselves in the love of god
[45:59] looking for the mercy of our lord jesus
[46:01] christ and to eternal life
[46:03] and of some have compassion making a
[46:05] difference and others say with fear
[46:08] pulling them out of the fire hating even
[46:09] the garments spotted by the flesh
[46:12] now unto him that is able to keep you
[46:14] from falling
[46:15] and to present you faultless before the
[46:17] presence of his glory
[46:18] with exceeding joy here's the only one
[46:21] that can do this
[46:22] to the only wise god our savior be glory
[46:26] and majesty
[46:27] dominion and power both now and ever
[46:31] and the church said amen god bless you
[46:34] this evening as you
[46:35] may have your seats there for just a few
[46:36] moments tonight from the
[46:38] from those scriptures i'd like to speak
[46:39] to you if i will title this tonight
[46:41] i want to speak to you on the
[46:42] accumulation of faith
[46:45] the accumulation of faith i truly
[46:47] believe that this is the hour that we
[46:49] have been restored back to not a faith
[46:51] amen but to thee faith and it's the
[46:53] faith of the lord jesus christ and i
[46:55] don't believe
[46:56] that it's a faith that is only going to
[46:58] take us so far
[46:59] but i believe the faith of jesus christ
[47:01] is going to take us all the way
[47:03] some they begin the journey and they
[47:04] only go so far but there are some
[47:07] amen that's ordained of god to go all
[47:09] the way and we realize the time we're
[47:10] living in
[47:11] amen that god is doing some marvelous
[47:14] things in this time we
[47:15] we realize he is saving souls amen he is
[47:18] he is healing the sick he is raising the
[47:20] dead he is
[47:21] casting out devils god is doing so many
[47:23] marvelous things in this time
[47:25] and i'll just say this we are actually
[47:26] blessed to be a part of it we're
[47:28] actually
[47:29] actually blessed tonight to be a part of
[47:30] what god is doing in this age the
[47:33] prophet said what a picture it gives us
[47:34] tonight
[47:35] of the church in the last days you see
[47:37] what man can do
[47:38] and then you see what god does what man
[47:40] does is failing now notice how he says
[47:42] this what
[47:43] man does is failing and will fail and
[47:46] has
[47:46] failed and will always fail but what god
[47:49] does
[47:49] is eternal and must forever remain
[47:52] nothing can ever take it away
[47:54] what man does is failing and it will
[47:56] fail and it has failed
[47:58] fail and it always will fail but what
[48:01] god does is eternal and must forever
[48:03] remain
[48:04] nothing can ever take it away god give
[48:06] it it's his free gift and by sovereign
[48:08] foresight
[48:09] he saw it and placed it and there's
[48:11] nothing can ever
[48:13] move it it's there eternally now think
[48:15] about that what man does
[48:17] amen it has failed it is failing it will
[48:20] fail it will always fail
[48:21] amen but what god does must always and
[48:24] forever remain then to think tonight
[48:26] amen that the devil only has one desire
[48:29] and that is to take away
[48:30] amen what god has done for you if god
[48:32] has saved you
[48:34] he has one desire that is take away your
[48:36] salvation if god has delivered you
[48:38] he has one desire that is to take you
[48:40] back into the bondage that god has
[48:42] delivered you out of if god has healed
[48:44] you
[48:44] he has one desire and that is to take
[48:46] away your healing but the bible says
[48:48] amen heaven and earth shall pass away
[48:50] amen but my word
[48:52] shall not pass away then to think
[48:54] tonight amen that god can do something
[48:56] in the hearts and the lives of
[48:57] individuals
[48:58] amen that no devil can take it away to
[49:01] faint tonight
[49:02] amen that if god saved you he didn't
[49:04] save you today
[49:05] amen to lose you tomorrow if god
[49:07] redeemed you he didn't redeem you today
[49:09] amen to lose you tomorrow whatever god
[49:11] does amen
[49:12] is not failing it will never fail it has
[49:15] never failed it will always remain let
[49:17] me say this
[49:18] we are not built out of stuff that just
[49:20] falls apart amen
[49:21] amen we are not built out of things it
[49:23] just blows away amen at the first
[49:25] trouble we thought up our hands and walk
[49:27] away that's not the material
[49:28] amen that we are built out of we are
[49:30] built out of the same material
[49:32] amen that noah was built out of we are
[49:34] peeled out of the same material that
[49:36] abraham and sarah
[49:37] amen was built out of we are not made
[49:40] amen out of stuff that is temporary we
[49:42] are made out of stuff that is eternal
[49:44] and then that's why tonight i'm
[49:45] preaching to people amen that's been
[49:47] through
[49:47] troubles and they've been through trials
[49:49] and they've been through situations but
[49:51] there's nothing they've been through
[49:53] amen that had more power than what was
[49:54] on the inside of them
[49:56] and then because a man didn't put it in
[49:58] there and then god put it in there and
[50:00] if god put it in there
[50:01] it is not their temporary it is their
[50:04] eternal
[50:04] what man done has failed it is failing
[50:07] and it will always
[50:08] fill but what god does amen is eternal
[50:11] then that's why
[50:12] that we must forget amen about all
[50:14] things
[50:15] amen concerning a man we get in our mind
[50:17] that man's got to be here
[50:18] amen for god to heal a certain man is
[50:20] going to be here for god to say
[50:22] amen it's not a certain man it's jesus
[50:25] christ
[50:25] the same yesterday amen today and
[50:28] forever then tonight
[50:29] if your preacher favorite preacher is
[50:31] not in the building all things are still
[50:33] possible hey
[50:33] amen if your favorite singer is not
[50:35] singing all things are still possible
[50:38] this is not the work of a man this is
[50:41] amen the work of almighty god that's why
[50:44] jude said remember ye the words
[50:46] which were spoken before now the prophet
[50:47] says lord there has already been prayer
[50:49] offered in this place tonight
[50:51] amen the songs of zion have been sung by
[50:53] your children and their hearts have been
[50:55] lifted up
[50:56] and we have come here to consecrate
[50:57] ourselves to the end of worship fee
[50:59] from the depths of our soul and we're
[51:01] calling this to your remembrance lord
[51:03] that you said when you set up on the
[51:05] mount and you taught your disciples you
[51:07] said blessed are they
[51:08] that do hunger and thirst for
[51:09] righteousness for they shall be filled
[51:11] you promised it lord
[51:13] now we are coming tonight amen with open
[51:16] hearts we're coming tonight
[51:17] with open hearts we're coming hungry and
[51:20] thirsting and we know
[51:22] that you'll keep your promise see amen
[51:24] there's not a bunch of open hearts here
[51:25] tonight
[51:26] amen hoping that god will keep his
[51:28] promise amen but there's open hearts
[51:30] here tonight knowing
[51:31] amen that before they ever even gathered
[51:33] this spiel amen that god would not make
[51:36] a promise
[51:36] amen and then gather a group of people
[51:38] around the house of god
[51:40] ain't meant to hear about that promise
[51:41] if he was not god enough to keep that
[51:43] promise
[51:44] amen if he was god enough to keep that
[51:46] promise and then that he's got enough
[51:48] here tonight to fulfill that promise
[51:50] and it don't matter what devil says it's
[51:52] impossible it don't matter what spirit
[51:54] tries to stop it
[51:55] it don't matter what unbelief raises its
[51:57] hand in the midst of believers that
[51:59] knows that this is more than a man
[52:01] there is a sword here tonight ain't been
[52:04] to cut the head off of every unbelieving
[52:06] spirit
[52:06] and say father you promised you would
[52:08] come in our midst and you would give us
[52:10] the desires of our hearts so we know
[52:13] tonight that god
[52:14] he keeps his promises he says as we
[52:17] endeavor to open up these sacred pages
[52:19] of the bible
[52:20] to read from it its contents may the
[52:22] holy spirit just take it to every heart
[52:24] and may that seed fall down into deep
[52:26] rich faith
[52:27] that will bring forth every promise
[52:29] somebody say every promise every promise
[52:32] that the word is made
[52:34] he said hear us lord and cleanse us and
[52:36] try us
[52:37] and if there be any unclean thing about
[52:39] us lord any unconfessed sin
[52:41] anything that's not right reveal it just
[52:43] now lord
[52:44] and we'll walk right straight and do it
[52:46] for we realize we are living in the
[52:48] shadows
[52:49] of the coming of the lord jesus and we
[52:51] have oh holy god
[52:53] coming to thy shadows of the justice
[52:54] tonight and we are pleading
[52:56] for a new dedication he said a
[52:59] consecration
[53:00] and a feeling of the holy spirit in our
[53:02] lives seeing the revival powers begin to
[53:04] dim down
[53:05] amen let us throw on the wood of the
[53:07] word that it might kindle a new fire
[53:09] then our hearts would be full of zeal
[53:11] amen i tell you that's what we need
[53:12] tonight amen it's not a new quote book
[53:15] amen it's not a new idea it's not a new
[53:17] school what we need tonight
[53:19] amen is some wood in the word they meant
[53:21] to fall upon the fire
[53:22] amen and let that power begin to burn he
[53:25] said sanctify us lord
[53:26] through thy precious word and thy blood
[53:29] and thy grace we plead and all thanks
[53:31] and praise will be thine
[53:32] he said give us pure hearts and clean
[53:35] hands
[53:35] and clean minds that we might come in
[53:37] the sanctuary
[53:39] amen night after night rejoicing and be
[53:42] filled with your spirit
[53:43] then i ask you the question tonight amen
[53:45] why do we come to church
[53:47] do we come to see each other do we come
[53:49] just to hear the preacher
[53:50] do we come just to sing a bunch of songs
[53:52] he said people think church is a good
[53:54] place to go
[53:54] oh you go there to learn to be good that
[53:56] isn't it friend no
[53:58] god is god amen the very reason we come
[54:02] to the house of god is because god is
[54:04] god
[54:05] he said now watch amen and if he ever
[54:07] was he's just as great today as he ever
[54:10] was
[54:11] and he always will be the same he said
[54:13] we just love him
[54:14] amen now there's something to think
[54:16] about god is still god and the devil is
[54:18] still the devil
[54:19] amen but if god is still god then his
[54:22] word is still true
[54:23] and his power is still among us amen i'm
[54:25] on the preacher for a second
[54:27] amen i don't think there's any room now
[54:29] ain't been this close to the coming of
[54:30] the lord
[54:31] amen to power need to some spirit i
[54:33] don't think this is the hour
[54:35] they meant to power me to someone some
[54:37] oversetting sin
[54:38] or some habit or some stronghold if god
[54:41] was
[54:42] ever god he still got here tonight that
[54:44] means if he ever set somebody free
[54:46] he's still doing it today if you've ever
[54:49] healed somebody of cancer
[54:50] he's still doing it here today if he
[54:52] ever gave the holy ghost
[54:54] he's still given the holy ghost today
[54:56] there is no limits on my god
[54:58] amen if it's in his word and his word is
[55:01] true
[55:01] and his power is here amen to perform
[55:04] the promise that he wrote in his own
[55:05] word
[55:07] yes sir god is still god and satan is
[55:10] still satan now you'll realize that
[55:12] satan
[55:12] amen we call him a dumb devil and he is
[55:14] amen but let me say this satan is very
[55:16] strategic
[55:17] and he is very deceptive paul will say
[55:20] unless satan
[55:21] should get an advantage of us amen for
[55:23] we are not
[55:24] ignorant of his devices we are not
[55:28] ignorant of his devices
[55:29] that word devices mean mind amen or
[55:32] thoughts or mental perception amen of an
[55:34] evil purpose
[55:35] that which thanks mine thoughts or
[55:37] purposes the problem of god said now we
[55:39] find
[55:39] that this great enemy of god thought now
[55:41] as long as they will believe that word
[55:44] i can never get to them and as long as
[55:47] that little family in eden
[55:48] keeps behind that word i can never touch
[55:51] them
[55:51] neither can he today he's still blocked
[55:54] off
[55:55] he meant the devil knows today he cannot
[55:58] touch
[55:58] god sealed he meant an anointed sons and
[56:01] daughters of god
[56:02] that's right but if i can use some real
[56:04] good strategy and just reason out
[56:06] i give some human reasonings because
[56:08] well she's human if i can just give
[56:10] human reasonings
[56:11] then we'll win the battles satan and his
[56:13] angels he said then eve gave away
[56:15] so therefore we know our enemy by his
[56:18] attacks
[56:18] maybe you didn't get it just right the
[56:20] way i said it we know
[56:22] our enemy when anyone any spirit any
[56:25] person
[56:26] even tries to disagree with god's word
[56:28] remember
[56:29] that's your enemy amen that is your
[56:31] enemy when any spirit
[56:33] amen any person or anything tries to
[56:36] disagree with god's word that's not your
[56:37] friend
[56:38] amen that's not your brother that's not
[56:40] your sister that
[56:41] is your enemy that's his old attack he
[56:44] said the one he broke the human race
[56:46] down with
[56:47] that's the way he breaks it down yet
[56:48] today he said that's the way he gets you
[56:50] away from god
[56:51] is to disbelieve his word and the only
[56:54] way you can ever stay in fellowship with
[56:56] god
[56:56] and talk to him in the cool of the
[56:59] evening is stay fortified in the word
[57:01] he said now let the curtain of god's
[57:03] word amen drop all around you
[57:05] and you'd be a drop right in the middle
[57:07] of it he said then you
[57:08] are fortified amen then one of satan's
[57:11] strategies
[57:12] in the last days is in the time of
[57:13] trouble is to get the people to forget
[57:16] amen that god is still god he doesn't
[57:19] necessarily want you to forget
[57:21] amen the church you go to he doesn't
[57:23] necessarily want you to forget
[57:24] amen your pastor forget amen your
[57:27] favorite preacher forget
[57:28] amen the favorite meaning you've ever
[57:29] been in but the devil wants you to
[57:31] forget
[57:31] amen that god is still god for paul will
[57:34] say in romans 1 28
[57:36] and even as they did not like to retain
[57:38] god in their knowledge god gave them
[57:40] over
[57:40] amen to a reprobate mind to do things
[57:43] amen which are not convenient
[57:45] see what a reprobate mind does it
[57:47] forgets how god's word
[57:49] said his love amen would be manifested
[57:52] it forgets how god's word amen said that
[57:54] he would perform
[57:55] amen the promises of his word amen now
[57:58] that's what the devil does is he puts a
[57:59] heaviness upon the church
[58:01] and he'll say the reason why you're
[58:02] going through this is because god has
[58:04] forgot you
[58:05] amen the reason why you're facing this
[58:07] trial amen it's because god has forgot
[58:09] you
[58:09] amen the last thing the devil wants you
[58:11] to do is stand before a mountain
[58:13] and remember that god said amen speak to
[58:16] the mountain and the mountain will be
[58:17] removed
[58:18] and then the last thing the devil wants
[58:19] you to do a minute to seek cancer
[58:21] they've been show up in somebody's body
[58:23] amen and stand there and remember the
[58:25] word of god said
[58:26] let's start praying the prayer of faith
[58:27] amen and the sick shall be healed
[58:29] amen when you're standing there in the
[58:30] hour of crisis and you don't know where
[58:32] to turn to and you don't know who to
[58:33] look to
[58:34] remember the last thing the devil wants
[58:35] you to do is to remember that god said
[58:38] in the time of trouble you will call
[58:40] unto me and i will hear you
[58:42] and i will answer you or y'all hear me
[58:44] tonight if the devil
[58:45] even can get us to forget god's word and
[58:48] get us to get out from behind
[58:50] god's word then the devil has already
[58:52] won the battle
[58:54] the prophet said they look at the love
[58:55] of god as this the cloudy skies and
[58:57] storms of life
[58:58] are no signs of god's disapproval amen
[59:01] neither are bright skies
[59:02] and still water signs of his love and
[59:04] approval his approval of any of us is
[59:06] only in the beloved
[59:08] he said his love is elective which he
[59:10] had for us before
[59:12] he been the foundation of the world amen
[59:14] now think about this god loves you
[59:16] amen before the trial you come against
[59:18] that caused you to question god's love
[59:20] for you
[59:21] amen he loved you before the first
[59:23] negative doctor's report you received
[59:25] that the devil tried to get you to use
[59:27] and ask if god really
[59:28] or you hear me tonight amen let's just
[59:30] settle one thing
[59:31] god loves you amen he knows you and he
[59:34] cares for you
[59:36] and there's nothing past there's nothing
[59:38] present there's nothing in the future
[59:40] amen that can separate us from the love
[59:42] of god that is in christ jesus
[59:45] does he love us oh yes but how shall we
[59:49] know
[59:49] we shall know because he said so amen
[59:52] see what did he say he
[59:53] said so where did he say it in his word
[59:56] and manifested that
[59:57] he did love for us and brought us
[59:59] himself and gave us of his spirit
[1:00:02] placing us as sons and how shall i prove
[1:00:04] my love to him
[1:00:05] by believing what he said and by
[1:00:08] conducting myself with joy
[1:00:10] amidst the trials that he and his wisdom
[1:00:12] allows to come to pass
[1:00:14] they've been seething tonight they met
[1:00:16] in the time of trial
[1:00:17] that's not the time to quit praising god
[1:00:19] in the time of trouble that's not the
[1:00:21] time to quit worshiping the lord
[1:00:23] if there's ever been a time amen that
[1:00:25] the church can i preach here for a
[1:00:27] minute
[1:00:27] has there ever been a time that the
[1:00:29] church needs to praise god
[1:00:31] it's right now amen i know the devil
[1:00:33] right now is even fighting our young
[1:00:34] people
[1:00:35] amen he's trying to tell you and all
[1:00:36] that emotion this weekend was just a
[1:00:38] bunch of work up
[1:00:39] and there was nothing really valued in
[1:00:41] that amen the devil will get on some old
[1:00:43] pride methodists around the message
[1:00:45] and say we don't need shouting we don't
[1:00:46] need praise of god amen but let me tell
[1:00:48] you tonight if anybody
[1:00:50] has got a right to praise god it's
[1:00:52] somebody
[1:00:53] amen that god has done something for if
[1:00:56] anybody's got a right
[1:00:57] amen to lift up hands and to dance in
[1:01:00] the spirit
[1:01:00] and to sound around the walls of jericho
[1:01:03] it's the pride
[1:01:04] of jesus christ how can we do it because
[1:01:07] he loves us
[1:01:08] amen he loved us before the foundation
[1:01:11] of the world
[1:01:11] he knew these trials was coming he knew
[1:01:14] this age was coming
[1:01:15] but he knew there would be a pride on
[1:01:17] the earth that would stand there behind
[1:01:19] the word
[1:01:19] and say i refuse amen to forget what he
[1:01:22] said
[1:01:23] in his word and when you look in the
[1:01:25] corinthians the 10th chapter
[1:01:26] you'll find there paul writing and he's
[1:01:28] showing you israel's experiences
[1:01:30] amen as an example for the church which
[1:01:32] is warning us
[1:01:33] from hebrew history and you'll notice
[1:01:35] there that paul taps the life of the
[1:01:37] wilderness
[1:01:38] as the christian life in first
[1:01:39] corinthians 10 verse 1
[1:01:41] for over brethren i would not that you
[1:01:42] should be ignorant how that all our
[1:01:44] fathers were under the cloud
[1:01:46] and all passed through the sea and were
[1:01:48] all baptized into moses in the cloud
[1:01:50] and in the sea and they'd all eat the
[1:01:52] same spiritual meat
[1:01:53] and did all bring the same spiritual
[1:01:54] drink for they drank of that spiritual
[1:01:57] rock that followed them
[1:01:58] and that rock was christ
[1:02:01] but with many of them god was not well
[1:02:03] pleased for they were overthrown in the
[1:02:05] wilderness
[1:02:06] now these things were our examples amen
[1:02:08] to the intent we should not lust
[1:02:10] after evil things as they also lusted
[1:02:13] now he says neither ye be idolaters as
[1:02:14] some of them
[1:02:15] as it was written the people sat down to
[1:02:17] eat and drink and rose up to play
[1:02:19] neither let us commit fornication as
[1:02:21] some of them committed and fail in one
[1:02:23] day
[1:02:23] three and twenty thousand neither let us
[1:02:25] tip christ as some of them also tempted
[1:02:27] and were destroyed of serpents
[1:02:28] neither murmur ye as some of them also
[1:02:31] murmured and were destroyed of the
[1:02:33] destroyer
[1:02:34] now all these things happen unto them
[1:02:36] for examples

[1:05:12] stand for it tonight
[1:05:15] the prophet said now remember this
[1:05:16] christ in the true church
[1:05:18] is a continuation of the book of acts
[1:05:20] but the book of revelation
[1:05:22] shows how that antichrist spirit would
[1:05:23] come into the church and the talent
[1:05:25] they've been making it lukewarm and
[1:05:27] formal and powerless it exposes satan
[1:05:30] revealing his works his attempt to
[1:05:32] destruction of god's people
[1:05:33] and the discrediting of god's word right
[1:05:36] down to the time
[1:05:37] he is cast into the lake of fire he
[1:05:39] fights that
[1:05:40] he cannot stand it are you hearing that
[1:05:42] even he fights that
[1:05:44] he cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:05:46] people get the true revelation
[1:05:48] of the true church and what she is and
[1:05:51] what she
[1:05:52] stands for notice where your power is
[1:05:54] coming from
[1:05:55] he didn't say your power is coming from
[1:05:57] what you stand against
[1:05:58] he's saying your power is coming from
[1:06:01] what you stand for
[1:06:02] and she can do the greater works than
[1:06:05] she
[1:06:06] might be an invincible army she might
[1:06:08] possibly wake up one day
[1:06:10] and realize if devils has been lying to
[1:06:12] her so long have no authority over
[1:06:14] no sir my prophet said when you
[1:06:16] recognize who you are
[1:06:18] and you recognize what you come from and
[1:06:20] you recognize the word of god
[1:06:22] can defeat the devil anywhere anytime
[1:06:24] anyplace
[1:06:25] under any condition when you recognize
[1:06:27] what you stand for
[1:06:28] then you will be an invincible army
[1:06:32] let me announce it tonight there's not
[1:06:34] an invincible army coming
[1:06:35] there's an invincible army here tonight
[1:06:40] i'm not looking for an invincible army i
[1:06:42] see one tonight
[1:06:43] she's not in prophecy she is in
[1:06:46] fulfillment tonight
[1:06:47] she is not enlightened she is impressed
[1:06:50] tonight
[1:06:50] and then the prophet said she will be an
[1:06:53] invincible army
[1:06:54] that's not just a 50 year old preacher
[1:06:57] that's a 16 year old boy
[1:06:58] that's a 15 year old girl when she
[1:07:01] recognizes
[1:07:02] what she stands for when she recognizes
[1:07:04] who she is
[1:07:05] when she recognizes where she comes from
[1:07:07] when she recognizes the word
[1:07:09] is greater than the devil against her
[1:07:12] she
[1:07:12] will be an invincible army
[1:07:18] that's not coming that's here tonight
[1:07:24] she will be if they get a true
[1:07:26] revelation of the two spirits within the
[1:07:28] framework
[1:07:29] of the christian church and by god's
[1:07:31] spirit desert
[1:07:32] and withstand the antichrist spirit
[1:07:34] satan
[1:07:35] will be powerless before her
[1:07:39] or y'all hear me tonight satan will be
[1:07:41] powerless before her
[1:07:43] he will be deathly forwarded today as
[1:07:45] with christ
[1:07:46] we stood in every effort to gain power
[1:07:48] him in the desert
[1:07:50] yes satan hates revelation but we love
[1:07:53] it
[1:07:53] with true revelation in our lives the
[1:07:55] gates of hell
[1:07:56] cannot prevail against us but we will
[1:07:59] prevail against them
[1:08:00] see that's why jesus told peter upon
[1:08:03] this rock
[1:08:04] i will build my church and the gates of
[1:08:06] hell
[1:08:08] shall not prevail against it then that
[1:08:10] tells me tonight that the whole church
[1:08:12] of the living god is built upon
[1:08:14] spiritual revelation
[1:08:16] the prophet says there is nothing of
[1:08:18] such prevailing power
[1:08:20] as the revelation of the word there is
[1:08:23] nothing
[1:08:24] there is no feeling there is no
[1:08:25] sensation there is no emotion
[1:08:27] there is no there is no power there is
[1:08:30] nothing as
[1:08:30] powerful and as prevailing as the
[1:08:33] revelation of the word
[1:08:35] that's when it's more than an education
[1:08:37] that's when it's more than a head
[1:08:38] knowledge
[1:08:39] that's when something in your heart has
[1:08:41] connected with the unseen
[1:08:43] and there's a pulsation amen of faith
[1:08:45] are you hearing me there's a pulsation
[1:08:47] of faith in there and it's pulsating

[1:16:02] want to see you rooted
[1:16:04] and grounded in that holy faith i don't
[1:16:06] want to see you tossed about
[1:16:07] but every wind of doctrine come by shake
[1:16:09] you and carry on

[1:16:55] organization i'm not here this morning
[1:16:57] to do that
[1:16:58] christ never sent me to build
[1:17:00] organization

[1:19:58] one experience
[1:19:59] and then leads to another experience and
[1:20:01] another experience leads to a deeper
[1:20:02] experience
[1:20:03] until you yourself amen are a house on
[1:20:06] fire
[1:20:07] in a windy day you see what the word of
[1:20:10] bound means
[1:20:11] it means to exceed a fixed number or
[1:20:14] measure
[1:20:14] it means to be preeminent it means to
[1:20:16] excel it means to excel more
[1:20:19] amen than one expects one to excel are
[1:20:21] y'all hearing me
[1:20:22] ain't been the devil brother let him
[1:20:24] know he didn't expect you to be in the
[1:20:25] house of god here tonight
[1:20:26] he put a limit on your blessing he said
[1:20:28] all right i'll let him kill the holy
[1:20:30] ghost
[1:20:30] i'll let him testify i'll let him fall
[1:20:32] out of the power of god but he won't be
[1:20:34] on that front roll wednesday night but
[1:20:35] do you realize just your being here
[1:20:37] tonight
[1:20:38] has already exceeded amen the devil's
[1:20:41] limitations
[1:20:42] upon what god done in your life
[1:20:45] are you hear me if a man done something
[1:20:48] for you this weekend
[1:20:49] you wouldn't be here tonight if it was
[1:20:51] just a man you still wouldn't have the
[1:20:53] faith in your heart
[1:20:54] but because it wasn't a man it was god
[1:20:56] to come on the scene
[1:20:58] then what god does will remain eternal
[1:21:00] what god does
[1:21:02] will never fail what god does will stand
[1:21:04] the test of time
[1:21:06] what god does will stand the lion's dead
[1:21:08] helping somebody
[1:21:09] what god does will stand and try to go
[1:21:12] out and save good life your head's
[1:21:14] coming off
[1:21:15] see when god does something the devil
[1:21:18] puts a limit upon it
[1:21:19] but god puts an anointing upon it to
[1:21:22] exceed the devil's limitations
[1:21:26] oh the devil says you know what we're
[1:21:28] tonight you're going to be so tired
[1:21:29] you ain't going to raise your hand and
[1:21:31] you know what you do you come in the
[1:21:32] house of god
[1:21:33] and you raise your hand the devil says
[1:21:35] you ain't going to be able to go back
[1:21:36] home
[1:21:37] and live a victorious life and you know
[1:21:39] what you say watch me
[1:21:40] the devil says you ain't going to be
[1:21:41] able to go back home and kick those
[1:21:43] habits
[1:21:44] out of your life and you say watch me
[1:21:48] stand back and watch them the devil says
[1:21:51] ain't no way
[1:21:52] amen ain't no way you're going to go
[1:21:53] back to school and keep the same victory
[1:21:55] you had
[1:21:56] before you went to that amendment you
[1:21:58] know what you're going to do stand back
[1:21:59] and watch me and can i tell you what the
[1:22:01] devil's trying to do
[1:22:02] he's trying to put a limit on you and so
[1:22:04] you ain't going to take a rapture
[1:22:05] but you know what i say stand back and
[1:22:07] watch
[1:22:09] if god exceeded your expectations
[1:22:11] therefore and what god done for me
[1:22:14] he'll do it again the devil can put as
[1:22:16] many limits
[1:22:17] as he wants to on this church as he
[1:22:19] wants to upon your brothers ministries
[1:22:21] as he wants to upon your lives but when
[1:22:23] god has said it's going to abandon
[1:22:25] there is no devil past or presence
[1:22:29] or future that can fix the limits of
[1:22:31] what god says that's going to be
[1:22:36] come on church you're not dealing with
[1:22:38] man's potentials
[1:22:40] you've got god's potentials in you
[1:22:43] man's potentials will not go go no
[1:22:45] further than a church service
[1:22:46] but god's potentials will keep on going
[1:22:50] yes sir this is the time amen for all
[1:22:53] things you say the time for all things
[1:22:55] yes sir
[1:22:55] the bible says to everything there is a
[1:22:57] season and a time to every purpose under
[1:23:00] the heaven
[1:23:00] in ecclesiastes 3 3 the bible says there
[1:23:03] is a time to kill
[1:23:05] and there is a time to heal i love this
[1:23:07] one there is a time
[1:23:09] to break down and a time
[1:23:13] to build up there is a time to tear down
[1:23:16] there is a time to build up these are
[1:23:18] things there are
[1:23:20] things that we must somebody shout we
[1:23:22] must
[1:23:23] there are things we must tear down but
[1:23:25] remember there are also
[1:23:26] things we must also build up there are
[1:23:29] things that must be torn down
[1:23:31] they must be demolished they must be
[1:23:33] destroyed there must be a holy ghost
[1:23:35] atomic bomb
[1:23:37] they've been dropped out of heaven on
[1:23:38] them things and annihilate them things
[1:23:40] but at the same time something is torn
[1:23:43] down
[1:23:43] at the same time something is
[1:23:45] annihilated then something
[1:23:47] has got to be built up you say what are
[1:23:50] you talking about the problem god said
[1:23:51] if the devil goes out
[1:23:52] he said something has got to come in and
[1:23:55] fill that up
[1:23:57] he said lord the devil will come back
[1:23:59] with seven more devils
[1:24:00] and you'll be worse off than the first
[1:24:02] time he said so when the devil goes out
[1:24:04] amen the holy ghost has got to come in
[1:24:06] listen it's got to go beyond your flesh
[1:24:08] it's got to go beyond your spirit it's
[1:24:10] got to go
[1:24:11] into the depths of your soul and seal
[1:24:14] that soul
[1:24:15] not until the next camp meeting maybe
[1:24:17] not until the next church service
[1:24:19] but unto the day of redemption
[1:24:23] what does the word build up the word
[1:24:25] build up means to establish
[1:24:26] amen to rebuild amen to cause to
[1:24:29] continue
[1:24:30] so what god done for you this weekend or
[1:24:32] what god's doing in your life even right
[1:24:34] now
[1:24:34] god does not desire amen for you to
[1:24:37] allow that devil
[1:24:38] to tear it down the message of the hour
[1:24:42] came
[1:24:43] amen to restore or to build us back to
[1:24:45] the original faith right
[1:24:48] now the bible says behold i will send
[1:24:51] you elijah the prophet
[1:24:52] he shall turn the heart somebody said
[1:24:54] the heart he shall turn the heart of the
[1:24:56] fathers to the children
[1:24:57] and the heart of the children to their
[1:24:58] fathers lest i come
[1:25:00] and smile the earth with a curse in jude
[1:25:02] 1 3 the bible says beloved when i gave
[1:25:05] all diligence to write unto you
[1:25:06] of the common salvation it was needful
[1:25:09] for me to write unto you and to exhort
[1:25:10] you
[1:25:11] that you should earnestly contend for
[1:25:13] the faith
[1:25:14] which was once delivered to the saints
[1:25:17] now do you realize we're living in a
[1:25:18] time
[1:25:19] of prophecy we're living in a time where
[1:25:21] the bible speaks about two different
[1:25:23] categories of people
[1:25:24] the bible says in timothy that in the
[1:25:26] last days
[1:25:27] evil spirits will come in they'll be
[1:25:29] seducers
[1:25:30] and they will seduce they will wax worse
[1:25:33] and worse
[1:25:34] they will be deceived and they'll be
[1:25:36] deceiving they'll be deceiving spirits
[1:25:38] he said there'll be some that are
[1:25:40] departing from the faith
[1:25:41] you know what that word depart means it
[1:25:43] means to draw back from
[1:25:45] it means to pull back it means to leave
[1:25:47] something
[1:25:48] that one should be embracing it needs to
[1:25:50] pull back
[1:25:51] and to excite a revolt so notice this
[1:25:54] when somebody departs from the faith
[1:25:56] which the faith is the word which is the
[1:25:58] message of the hour
[1:25:59] what do they do they start a revolt and
[1:26:02] they say you
[1:26:03] need to get out of there as well see if
[1:26:04] they'd get that excited
[1:26:06] amen about the faith for serving god
[1:26:08] that they did about leaving god imagine
[1:26:10] where they would be
[1:26:11] but they excite a revolt and they say
[1:26:13] come on you got to get out of that
[1:26:15] message
[1:26:15] it's nothing but bondage but do you
[1:26:17] realize there's a prophecy speaking to
[1:26:19] them
[1:26:19] that some are going to depart from the
[1:26:21] faith but there's another prophecy
[1:26:23] amen speaking that some are going to
[1:26:25] contend for the faith
[1:26:27] amen some are going to depart from the
[1:26:29] faith amen but some
[1:26:30] are going to contend for the faith and i
[1:26:32] don't know what you know but i'll tell
[1:26:33] you what i know
[1:26:34] i'm not a departer i'm a contender
[1:26:39] i'm not a departer i am a contender some
[1:26:42] are called me depart
[1:26:43] some are called to go you know what some
[1:26:45] are called they meant to have youtube
[1:26:47] ministries
[1:26:48] and put the message on trial and put
[1:26:50] brother branham on trial
[1:26:51] and give their sorry old sob story of
[1:26:53] why they left the message
[1:26:55] and how much bond is in the message and
[1:26:57] you know what i've come to conclusion of
[1:26:59] we can argue with them all day long we
[1:27:01] could we can tie it with a job
[1:27:02] until our fingers get carpal tunnel we
[1:27:05] can argue until our fingers fall off
[1:27:07] and you know what brother we ain't gonna
[1:27:08] change them but can i tell you something
[1:27:10] else
[1:27:10] they ain't gonna change us either
[1:27:16] i'm not wasting my time if they want to
[1:27:18] depart let them depart
[1:27:20] i say god have mercy but there's some
[1:27:22] here
[1:27:23] come on church there's some here that's
[1:27:25] ordained to contend
[1:27:26] there's some here that's ordained to
[1:27:28] finish
[1:27:30] there's some here that's ordained across
[1:27:32] the finish line
[1:27:33] there's some here that's our name to
[1:27:35] walk the streets of those
[1:27:37] there's some here that's ordained to
[1:27:39] look at walls of jasper
[1:27:41] there's some here this ordained to walk
[1:27:43] through the gates
[1:27:44] that are already hung and are already
[1:27:46] hence there is a bride on the earth
[1:27:49] that is not dying she is abounding
[1:27:56] in the last days see what happens the
[1:27:58] devil don't realize he thinks we're
[1:28:00] getting weaker
[1:28:00] but in reality we're there we're getting
[1:28:02] stronger
[1:28:03] see i want to tell the devil i'm
[1:28:05] stronger now
[1:28:06] than i've ever been before
[1:28:10] he didn't like that but i really don't
[1:28:12] care we're stronger now
[1:28:15] than we've ever been before you see why
[1:28:18] because we're not at the bottom
[1:28:20] we have come to the top one of them was
[1:28:22] martin luther
[1:28:23] he began to shine a lot then here come
[1:28:25] wesley come stronger
[1:28:27] he began to shine the baptism of the
[1:28:29] holy ghost strong or stronger there he
[1:28:31] said rather here come pentecostal begin
[1:28:33] to shine the baptism
[1:28:34] of the holy ghost but in the last days
[1:28:36] in the last days of malachi 4
[1:28:38] elijah is to come with the very word
[1:28:43] what turned the hearts of the children
[1:28:46] back to the faith of god he says that
[1:28:49] fourth light
[1:28:50] satan and the bride is a faith woman
[1:28:52] that is called out by his name
[1:28:54] let me just say this amen tonight i want
[1:28:56] to say it like this
[1:28:57] we have seen the sign and we have heard
[1:28:59] the voice
[1:29:00] we are not here looking for a message we
[1:29:03] have found the message
[1:29:04] we are not here trying to find what god
[1:29:07] promised to do in this day
[1:29:08] god has sent a lot and that light is
[1:29:11] lined right up with the word
[1:29:12] and revealed to you the promises of the
[1:29:14] day you're living in
[1:29:15] then it's time to lay aside every creed
[1:29:19] it's time to lay aside every dogma it's
[1:29:21] time to lay aside every tradition
[1:29:23] and walk in the word of your age
[1:29:27] and i'll just say it like this as the
[1:29:29] bride of jesus christ
[1:29:30] as a church now i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:29:32] preach here for a minute we'll go home
[1:29:33] okay
[1:29:34] amen as the bride of jesus christ we
[1:29:36] find that the devil wants to destroy our
[1:29:38] homes
[1:29:39] he wants to destroy our families he
[1:29:41] wants to destroy our lives
[1:29:42] he'll do everything he can to destroy
[1:29:44] individuals and when he can't destroy
[1:29:46] your home
[1:29:47] when he can't destroy your life when he
[1:29:49] can't destroy your family
[1:29:50] when he can't destroy the pastor when he
[1:29:52] can't destroy the ministry
[1:29:54] the devil comes to try and destroy the
[1:29:56] church
[1:29:58] now any church that's been established
[1:30:00] for any amount of time
[1:30:02] has been through all seasons that a
[1:30:04] church goes through
[1:30:05] you've been through shouting times and
[1:30:07] you've been through pounding times
[1:30:08] now don't start pouting on me now okay
[1:30:11] you've been through running times
[1:30:12] and you've been through walking times
[1:30:14] you've been through you've been through
[1:30:15] you've been through fiery times
[1:30:17] and you've been through cold times
[1:30:21] we are still human
[1:30:24] we go through all seasons that that is
[1:30:27] that as nature goes through a church
[1:30:29] goes through those same seasons
[1:30:31] and as a church you begin to accumulate
[1:30:33] things
[1:30:34] it's a church you begin to accumulate
[1:30:37] things now what does the word accumulate
[1:30:38] mean
[1:30:39] it means together together or acquire an
[1:30:42] increasing number or quantity
[1:30:44] gradually gather amen a require a
[1:30:46] resulting hole
[1:30:47] amen it means to build up now there's a
[1:30:50] story of a man
[1:30:51] who was growing we're really weary one
[1:30:53] time in serving god
[1:30:54] and that man got so low that he got down
[1:30:57] on his knees
[1:30:58] and he said lord i'm going to stop
[1:30:59] serving you he said but before i go
[1:31:01] i want to take just a few moments and i
[1:31:03] want to thank you for all the things
[1:31:05] you've done for me
[1:31:06] and he got down on his knees and began
[1:31:07] to thank you for healing him he began to
[1:31:09] thank him for paying his bills
[1:31:11] when he didn't have them he began to
[1:31:12] thank god of all different things that
[1:31:14] happened throughout his life that come
[1:31:16] to this spot
[1:31:16] and by the time the man got done praying
[1:31:18] he said well lord
[1:31:20] you've done too much for me now to quit
[1:31:22] i guess i'll just go on serving you
[1:31:24] realize
[1:31:28] do you realize what happened that man
[1:31:30] got down before god
[1:31:32] and he began to accumulate not all the
[1:31:34] bad things
[1:31:35] but all the good things
[1:31:39] he began to accumulate all the things
[1:31:42] that god had done for him
[1:31:43] and notice where he accumulated those
[1:31:45] things he didn't accumulate him in his
[1:31:47] head
[1:31:48] he accumulated them in his heart then
[1:31:50] they asked you a personal question
[1:31:52] tonight
[1:31:53] what are you accumulating
[1:31:56] the bible says lay up for yourselves
[1:31:58] treasures
[1:31:59] in heaven we're neither moth nor rusteth
[1:32:01] corrupt where thieves do not break
[1:32:03] through or steal
[1:32:04] for where your treasure is there will
[1:32:06] your heart be also
[1:32:07] that word treasure actually means a
[1:32:09] place in which good
[1:32:10] and valuable and precious things are
[1:32:13] collected
[1:32:14] and laid up it means a storehouse amen
[1:32:17] or a repository
[1:32:18] it means a place where good things are
[1:32:20] put and that tells me tonight brother
[1:32:22] that our heart actually is a storehouse
[1:32:25] look what david said
[1:32:26] he said with my whole heart have i
[1:32:28] sought thee oh let me not wonder for my
[1:32:30] commandments
[1:32:30] and thy word i have hid that treasure he
[1:32:33] had
[1:32:34] in my heart that i might not sin against
[1:32:36] thee
[1:32:37] paul says we have this treasure in earth
[1:32:40] and vessels
[1:32:41] that the excellency of the power may be
[1:32:43] of god and not of us
[1:32:45] we have this treasure where in earth and
[1:32:48] vessels
[1:32:49] in our heart that the excellency of the
[1:32:51] power may not be of us
[1:32:53] but it might be of god why because what
[1:32:56] man does
[1:32:57] has failed it will fail it will always
[1:32:59] fail and it is failing
[1:33:01] but what god does will remain see i want
[1:33:04] to read you something here
[1:33:05] in spiritual food and new season i want
[1:33:07] you to get built up now
[1:33:08] in the holy oracles of god in the faith

[1:33:12] hour the faith it's going to take more
[1:33:14] faith than ever was in any age

[1:33:20] be taken up and so we want you to
[1:33:23] believe tonight
[1:33:26] and so we want you to believe tonight
[1:33:29] in all that you have seen all that you
[1:33:31] have heard the word that you've heard
[1:33:33] preached

[1:33:51] wonders that you've seen down
[1:33:52] we want you to accumulate all of that
[1:33:55] together in your heart
[1:33:57] and consider whether if it be god or not
[1:34:03] help me jesus
[1:34:05] it's like elizabeth said if god be god
[1:34:07] then serve him
[1:34:09] and if jesus be the center of all things
[1:34:11] to the christian
[1:34:12] then i think we ought to let loose of
[1:34:15] everything else
[1:34:16] and cleave to him he then remember he is
[1:34:19] the
[1:34:19] center he is the lord star he is the
[1:34:22] ultimate
[1:34:23] he is the absolute if the north star if
[1:34:26] he's the north star
[1:34:27] there's only one thing that'll point to
[1:34:28] the north star that's your
[1:34:30] compass that you're sailing with see
[1:34:33] notice this
[1:34:34] i am telling you to sail with this word
[1:34:37] for the word
[1:34:38] always points to him then what is
[1:34:41] thinking
[1:34:42] remember the aaron thinking is
[1:34:43] accumulating when you begin to think
[1:34:46] you begin to accumulate when a man
[1:34:48] begins to think
[1:34:49] he begins to accumulate that's what the
[1:34:50] bible here says for as he thanketh in
[1:34:53] his heart
[1:34:53] so is he look at what this word think of
[1:34:55] mean it means to reason out
[1:34:58] it means to calculate it means to reckon
[1:35:01] it means to estimate the prophet said
[1:35:03] the hours come
[1:35:04] when god set forth his light there's an
[1:35:06] hour
[1:35:07] that when god's doing things amen nudge
[1:35:10] your neighbor
[1:35:11] and say this is the hour when god is
[1:35:14] doing things
[1:35:15] brother aaron this is the hour when god
[1:35:18] is doing things
[1:35:19] brother tim this is the hour when god is
[1:35:21] healing brain bleach
[1:35:22] this is the hour when god is healing
[1:35:24] cancer brother ron this is the hour
[1:35:27] when god has taken tumors out of
[1:35:29] people's body are you hearing me
[1:35:30] right here in the church this is the
[1:35:32] hour listen
[1:35:33] we've lived through denominational ages
[1:35:36] where man has done all kinds of things
[1:35:38] and it's all dried up and it's all
[1:35:40] washed away but there is a
[1:35:42] god of gods and the king of kings and
[1:35:44] the lord of lords
[1:35:46] is on the scene tonight church and he is
[1:35:49] doing some wonderful things
[1:35:52] he's healing the sick he's saving the
[1:35:54] laws he's restoring marriages
[1:35:56] he's tearing down strongholds he's
[1:35:58] bringing families back together
[1:36:00] he's revealing himself to the hearts and
[1:36:02] lives of his people are you hearing me
[1:36:04] man's done a lot but now it's time to
[1:36:06] stand back
[1:36:07] and watch god
[1:36:11] god has come on to say listen church god
[1:36:14] is taking tumors out of sister elena's
[1:36:15] body
[1:36:16] god amen has put hair back up on my head
[1:36:21] are you hearing me you know why people
[1:36:23] ain't got no strength to praise god
[1:36:24] because they've been accumulating the
[1:36:25] negative things
[1:36:28] they've been accumulating all the
[1:36:29] negativity and all the false doctrines
[1:36:31] and all who's doing what who's saying
[1:36:33] that's all they think about
[1:36:35] amen you want to know what something can
[1:36:37] i thank somebody to hear
[1:36:39] there's a guy told me one time he said
[1:36:40] i'm sick and tired of hearing preachers
[1:36:42] going around
[1:36:42] talking about all god's doing in their
[1:36:44] churches and all god's doing their
[1:36:46] ministries and all god's doing for their
[1:36:47] people
[1:36:48] that's what brother quit talking so
[1:36:49] negative might do something for you
[1:36:54] when all you do is feed on negativity it
[1:36:57] brings a negative atmosphere
[1:36:58] it brings a negative feeling it brings a
[1:37:01] negative service
[1:37:02] it brings a negative sermon but when you
[1:37:04] begin to accumulate
[1:37:05] everything in your heart that you've
[1:37:07] seen god do
[1:37:08] even like tabernacle won't you take a
[1:37:10] few minutes right now
[1:37:12] and begin to accumulate all the miracles
[1:37:15] you've seen god do
[1:37:16] you've seen raise the dead you've seen
[1:37:18] them stop
[1:37:30] and when you begin to accumulate all
[1:37:33] that god has done
[1:37:34] it begins to turn something on the
[1:37:36] inside of that
[1:37:37] and you can't contain your praise
[1:37:40] [Applause]
[1:37:44] don't mind the dancing don't mind me
[1:37:53] you don't know all that god has done for
[1:38:00] me
[1:38:04] sit there if you want to sit there and
[1:38:06] proud if you want to
[1:38:08] remember there's some people here that's
[1:38:09] been up against some walls
[1:38:11] but they've seen the walls come back
[1:38:13] there's some people here
[1:38:14] let's face devils but they've seen them
[1:38:16] devils come down
[1:38:17] there's some people here let's have to
[1:38:19] stand turning
[1:38:21] for their life against the devil but
[1:38:23] here we are tonight
[1:38:24] we're still standing because god is
[1:38:27] doing some wonderful things
[1:38:29] in this generation
[1:38:41] y'all just forgive me a minute we got
[1:38:43] some victory here tonight
[1:38:45] everything man's done is failed but what
[1:38:48] god has done
[1:38:49] will never fail
[1:38:58] listen the devil chose a man's head but
[1:39:01] god chose a man's heart
[1:39:03] are you hearing me the bible says
[1:39:05] there's two types of accumulation
[1:39:07] there's negative and then there's
[1:39:08] positive my bible says brethren
[1:39:11] whatsoever things are true
[1:39:14] what several things are honest but
[1:39:16] certain things are just
[1:39:17] or pure or lovely are of a good report
[1:39:23] if there be any virtue and if there be
[1:39:26] any praise amen think or accumulate
[1:39:29] these things if there be any victory in
[1:39:32] the church
[1:39:33] then forget about who didn't shake your
[1:39:34] hand
[1:39:37] if there'd be any if there be any
[1:39:41] liberty in the church
[1:39:42] then forget the pastor didn't compact
[1:39:44] you on the shoulder
[1:39:45] [Applause]
[1:39:48] can i preach a minute he said let me
[1:39:50] talk about he said when god began to
[1:39:51] deal with someone's heart
[1:39:52] he's preparing them for something see
[1:39:55] fake on these things
[1:39:56] don't think negative you think positive
[1:39:58] thank jesus
[1:39:59] you sit in church and think about
[1:40:01] everything else but god
[1:40:03] you set church and accumulate every
[1:40:05] fault every failure
[1:40:06] every negative thing you accumulate all
[1:40:08] that he said how are you going to do
[1:40:10] your washing
[1:40:11] what are you going to do at the office
[1:40:12] tomorrow how are you going to do this
[1:40:14] any other
[1:40:14] keep your mind off of that
[1:40:19] keep your mind off of that and think on
[1:40:22] god
[1:40:22] if there be any praise if there be any
[1:40:25] virtue
[1:40:26] then think on these things don't think
[1:40:28] on the negative thoughts
[1:40:30] don't let it go for your mind make every
[1:40:32] word positive
[1:40:33] and every thought positive see it listen
[1:40:36] the preacher which is the bringer of the
[1:40:38] word his gift
[1:40:40] is to get himself out of the way but the
[1:40:42] believer which is the hearer of the word
[1:40:44] must get yourself out of the way to
[1:40:46] receive the word that's being brought by
[1:40:48] the bringer
[1:40:51] now you may not like this quote but
[1:40:52] that's quite all right the only thing
[1:40:53] you have to do
[1:40:54] is know he is here is get yourself out
[1:40:57] of the way
[1:40:58] when you think your thoughts then god's
[1:41:00] thoughts don't have a chance
[1:41:03] when you think your thoughts then god's
[1:41:05] thoughts don't have a chance but if
[1:41:07] you'll quit thinking your thoughts
[1:41:08] and think his thoughts like this little
[1:41:10] lady laying here shaking this card
[1:41:12] that woman is going to lay there all of
[1:41:14] her life
[1:41:15] unless she she can get her faith right
[1:41:18] straight on jesus christ and no matter
[1:41:20] what comes
[1:41:22] or goes it be revealed to her then
[1:41:24] nothing
[1:41:25] is going to stop her healing
[1:41:29] are you hearing me amen if you can get
[1:41:31] your thoughts
[1:41:32] off of everything else and on the word
[1:41:35] of god
[1:41:36] and a revelation bell drop in your heart
[1:41:39] that this is your night this is your
[1:41:41] season i've been laying here long enough
[1:41:43] it's time to get up brother tim and it's
[1:41:45] time to walk
[1:41:46] it's time to go somewhere it's time to
[1:41:48] stop thanking them oh negative
[1:41:50] come on church you say lander you're
[1:41:52] just preaching the prosperity gospel
[1:41:54] i'm preaching from the message of the
[1:41:55] hour if every heart
[1:41:57] and every mind and every spirit would
[1:42:00] come in accordance with god's word
[1:42:01] eating unlike tabernacle you think
[1:42:03] you've seen miracles
[1:42:04] you ain't seen nothing yet
[1:42:11] you think you've seen god move you lay
[1:42:13] aside every negative thoughts
[1:42:15] you forget every injustice you forget
[1:42:17] everything
[1:42:18] that ever happened you forget every
[1:42:20] thought the devil's trying to get you to
[1:42:21] faith
[1:42:22] and just start considering was it gone
[1:42:24] or not to give them
[1:42:25] the holy ghost was it god or not that
[1:42:28] put air back on mariah's head
[1:42:29] was it god or not it rained sister karen
[1:42:32] out of that brain bleeding
[1:42:33] was it god or not that he'll elena are
[1:42:36] you hearing me
[1:42:38] was it god that healed her body i say
[1:42:40] yes
[1:42:41] and i say if he's god and he did it then
[1:42:44] he can do it again
[1:42:52] but i think on the negative you were
[1:42:53] given access for the negative to come
[1:42:55] into
[1:42:56] you and by giving access to the negative
[1:42:58] you become a negative person
[1:43:01] a negative preacher produces a negative
[1:43:03] pulpit and a negative pulpit produces
[1:43:05] negative views
[1:43:06] is this okay and a negative pew produces
[1:43:09] a negative church in the community
[1:43:11] and before long that negative church
[1:43:12] dies up and dries up
[1:43:14] [Applause]
[1:43:16] but a positive word are you hearing me
[1:43:20] the problem said i don't like anything
[1:43:21] negative i don't like the negative side
[1:43:24] i like to be on the positive side
[1:43:28] you know what sometimes you got to do
[1:43:29] brother you just got to come in church
[1:43:31] and you've got to forget everything and
[1:43:33] just worship god
[1:43:35] coleman told me one time he splattered
[1:43:38] he said sometimes you got to go to
[1:43:39] church and preach
[1:43:40] he said i can't do it myself he said you
[1:43:42] just have to close your eyes
[1:43:43] and just preach whatever god put on your
[1:43:45] heart he said cause people will frown at
[1:43:47] you
[1:43:47] they'll stare you down they'll try to
[1:43:49] cut you off he said if you just close
[1:43:51] your eyes
[1:43:51] just preach right on through i'll tell
[1:43:53] you what that's good advice for some
[1:43:54] church members
[1:43:56] wherever they knew so-and-so is looking
[1:43:58] at me and so-and-so might see me sound
[1:44:00] and so-and-so might see me rejoice i say
[1:44:02] close your eyes
[1:44:03] and remember if he's the ultimate if
[1:44:06] he's the north star
[1:44:07] if he is the compass that we're standing
[1:44:09] by if he's the god of abraham
[1:44:11] and the god of isaac and the god of
[1:44:13] taken that he's the god of even not
[1:44:15] tabernacle
[1:44:16] and there is no limits there is no limit
[1:44:21] there's no limits on my god my god can
[1:44:24] go in the fiery purpose
[1:44:25] my god can walk on water my god
[1:44:29] can turn water into wine my god can stop
[1:44:31] demon possession
[1:44:35] come on church you want to revive or
[1:44:37] take the limits off of god
[1:44:41] brother tim it's just the witness
[1:44:43] tonight that's a limit you put on god
[1:44:45] i don't care if it's wednesday i don't
[1:44:47] care if it's monday i don't care if it's
[1:44:49] sunday
[1:44:49] when you begin to accumulate and you'll
[1:44:52] begin to remember that god is still god
[1:44:56] he'll come down in the fourth man
[1:44:59] he'll come down and the fourth man and
[1:45:02] he'll push back that bout

[1:49:35] instead of faith
[1:49:36] but faith does the job right now
[1:49:40] hope hope for it but faith is a product
[1:49:43] so

[1:52:56] child
[1:52:56] if he could give hannah son if he could
[1:52:58] bring him
[1:52:59] if he could bring a child out of the
[1:53:01] virgin womb by the name of mary
[1:53:03] that i believe with all of my heart he
[1:53:05] could bring one's picture through a
[1:53:06] stroke
[1:53:07] he could bring him to the fire he could
[1:53:09] bring him through heart trouble
[1:53:10] and he can bring him to cancer and he'll
[1:53:12] come out on the other side
[1:53:13] and say accumulate this church god is
[1:53:16] still god
[1:53:19] and his word is still the truth
[1:53:25] but you know why if there's faith in
[1:53:27] this church tonight it's because of many
[1:53:29] god like with a team and these men
[1:53:30] and princes like brother rod and all
[1:53:32] these men of god that will come behind
[1:53:34] the pulpit
[1:53:35] and say quit accumulating all the
[1:53:37] negativity and start remembering the
[1:53:39] promise
[1:53:41] oh satan get out of here satan get out
[1:53:44] of here

[1:53:47] we've got the spirit of faith
[1:53:49] are you hearing me we're not
[1:53:51] accumulating a bunch of offenses tonight
[1:53:52] we're accumulating some faith here you
[1:53:54] know what amen i'm gonna i'm gonna close
[1:53:56] right here
[1:53:57] hebrews 11 amen it's not the heroes of
[1:54:00] the fence
[1:54:00] hebrews 11 is the heroes of faith so
[1:54:04] while some people
[1:54:05] have been accumulating defenses and they
[1:54:07] can't even raise their hands no more
[1:54:11] used to shout and run the aisles but
[1:54:13] they got so many offenses
[1:54:14] well so-and-so looked at me wrong and so
[1:54:16] and so dead
[1:54:20] accumulate all the fences and sit there
[1:54:22] like a wallflower if you won't
[1:54:24] but there's some of us we're going to
[1:54:25] accumulate some faith
[1:54:28] you realize there was a man named
[1:54:30] congressman shaw who in 1900's
[1:54:32] madison was nowhere near where it is
[1:54:34] today and william shaw was an 18 year
[1:54:36] old boy
[1:54:37] who fell and broke his spine being
[1:54:39] involved in the turn of the century was
[1:54:41] worse than anyone could imagine
[1:54:42] and an 18 year old boy was told come to
[1:54:45] terms
[1:54:46] you'll never walk again
[1:54:49] just come to terms with it you'll never
[1:54:51] get the victory over it
[1:54:53] just come to terms with it it'll always
[1:54:55] be this way but the next seven years
[1:54:58] he would lay in bed and eventually he
[1:55:00] would learn to walk again with crutches
[1:55:02] and you know what he would call them his
[1:55:04] little buddies
[1:55:05] but you know what i love brother phillip
[1:55:07] you know what i love he
[1:55:09] faced challenges but he built inner
[1:55:12] strength
[1:55:14] oh it went over your head he faced
[1:55:16] challenges but he built inner strength
[1:55:19] william upshaw became famous for three
[1:55:22] saiyans
[1:55:22] let nothing discourage you
[1:55:25] let nothing discourage you and the
[1:55:28] second one was
[1:55:30] never give up and you know what i love i
[1:55:33] love the third one
[1:55:34] oh william shaw would say god will
[1:55:37] heal me it just isn't time yet
[1:55:43] brother tim i'm about to put another
[1:55:44] door in this church god
[1:55:46] will heal me it just isn't
[1:55:49] time yet and for 66
[1:55:53] years he sat in a wheelchair and
[1:55:56] accumulated
[1:55:57] all the faith and accumulated all the
[1:56:00] power
[1:56:00] and one night in 1951 a prophet said i
[1:56:03] see you
[1:56:04] i see you fall over over the hayman he
[1:56:06] said oh
[1:56:07] but tonight you're not and a man who had
[1:56:09] been in a wheelchair
[1:56:10] for 66 years jumped up
[1:56:15] and ran up on the platform and touched
[1:56:17] his toes
[1:56:18] you know why because he had accumulated
[1:56:21] even some faith in his heart
[1:56:23] he hadn't accumulated all the hurts he
[1:56:25] hadn't accumulated all the offenses
[1:56:27] he had accumulated faith
[1:56:30] what are you saying preacher i'm
[1:56:32] standing right here tonight i'm going to
[1:56:34] give you

[1:56:55] what was going to take place
[1:56:57] but you realize we got preachers and
[1:56:58] teachers right now that deny
[1:57:00] what's happening in this building you
[1:57:02] know why because they can't be a part of
[1:57:04] it
[1:57:06] but i'll tell you why we're shouting

[1:57:15] across the earth

[1:58:45] everybody look at the camp no i've got
[1:58:47] some testimonies from people standing
[1:58:49] this field tonight
[1:58:50] i have dealt with anxiety off and on for
[1:58:52] a long time about my hair all falling
[1:58:54] out again
[1:58:55] and the devil was telling me you're just
[1:58:56] going to go bald and nobody's going to
[1:58:58] like you
[1:58:58] but on thursday night uncle timothy
[1:59:00] preached on scarecrows i went up for
[1:59:02] prayer
[1:59:02] and i thank god but i didn't feel a real
[1:59:04] breakthrough on friday night i went
[1:59:06] through the prayer line
[1:59:07] but i still didn't get my breakthrough
[1:59:09] on saturday night i almost didn't go up
[1:59:11] and get prayed for because i worried
[1:59:12] what people would think for a while the
[1:59:14] devil
[1:59:15] has been holding over me my past wrongs
[1:59:17] saying you can't get delivered because
[1:59:19] you did this
[1:59:19] so on saturday night i went and got
[1:59:21] prayed for and i was like devil
[1:59:23] you just shut your mouth
[1:59:38] what you say
[1:59:45] i was like devil just shut your mouth i
[1:59:48] knelt at the altar
[1:59:49] and i just started thanking the lord for
[1:59:51] my deliverances and the
[1:59:53] song leaders started singing my chains
[1:59:55] are gone i've been set free
[1:59:57] i immediately felt the tormenting
[1:59:59] spirits leave and the holy ghost bled my
[2:00:01] soul
[2:00:02] and i just collapsed i was still
[2:00:04] conscious and i wanted to get up and
[2:00:05] dance but i was so drunk i couldn't move
[2:00:07] i laid in his presence for hours until
[2:00:10] they took me back to the dorms
[2:00:11] and i'm still thinking god i feel all
[2:00:14] clean
[2:00:14] and on fire i have
[2:00:26] no thoughts in the back of my mind about
[2:00:29] my hair
[2:00:33] i feel free and happy like never before
[2:00:37] and to thank i almost missed my moments
[2:00:39] but i
[2:00:40] thank the lord that i didn't
[2:00:44] i almost missed it but i thank the lord
[2:00:46] that person's in this building tonight
[2:00:53] my experience here's another one my
[2:00:54] experience with the holy what are you
[2:00:56] doing i'm accumulating some things
[2:00:57] my experience with the holy ghost at
[2:00:59] camp was amazing
[2:01:01] when i found out we were gone i
[2:01:02] immediately started having expectations
[2:01:04] i was praying to receive the holy ghost
[2:01:06] what i expected was
[2:01:08] not even close to what i experienced to
[2:01:09] receive he'll meet your exceed
[2:01:11] limitations
[2:01:12] [Applause]
[2:01:13] on saturday night i became an underage
[2:01:16] drinker
[2:01:21] drinking off that blue wine the holy
[2:01:23] ghost all the services was amazing
[2:01:25] but that night was my turn before
[2:01:28] service my friend told me
[2:01:29] i was going to get drunk and i got
[2:01:31] excited because that's what i've been
[2:01:33] praying for
[2:01:34] and uncle timothy began preaching on the
[2:01:36] line he said there's enough for everyone
[2:01:38] that's when i said to myself he's
[2:01:40] preaching to me
[2:01:42] i then begin to create an atmosphere
[2:01:44] that god could come into me
[2:01:45] and when the song service started we
[2:01:47] started waving our white flags
[2:01:49] that's when he took control of me i
[2:01:51] started laughing uncontrollably
[2:01:53] every time i tried standing i started
[2:01:55] staggered that's when i knew i was drunk
[2:01:57] off the holy spirit it was the best
[2:02:00] feeling
[2:02:00] ever i thank god this can't i never
[2:02:04] could forget i thank god for letting me
[2:02:06] experience something like that
[2:02:09] can i give you another one as of friday
[2:02:11] night in oklahoma
[2:02:12] god delivered me of my old ways the
[2:02:15] music i listened to
[2:02:17] the way i talk and act if god can do it
[2:02:20] for me
[2:02:21] i have no doubt he can do it for someone
[2:02:24] else
[2:02:28] go ahead and joshua are you hearing me
[2:02:31] oh
[2:02:32] what are you doing i'm waving some white
[2:02:34] victory in here
[2:02:35] i'm waving some white flags in victory
[2:02:41] i was going to camp for a refill of the
[2:02:43] holy ghost
[2:02:44] and a special touch from the lord when i
[2:02:46] say a special touch
[2:02:47] i mean i really wanted to touch from him
[2:02:49] to get rid of something that i had
[2:02:51] and the weird thing is i didn't really
[2:02:52] know what it was that i had
[2:02:54] i just knew there was something hindered
[2:02:56] me in my walk with the lord
[2:02:57] i didn't really know what it was though
[2:02:59] i just knew something wasn't right
[2:03:01] and i needed to get rid of it so i went
[2:03:03] to the prayer line friday night
[2:03:04] and i got my refill and i went through
[2:03:06] it felt like something
[2:03:07] was lifted off my shoulders i jumped and
[2:03:10] screamed and didn't care
[2:03:11] i was just so happy that whatever it was
[2:03:14] lifted off of me
[2:03:15] i felt so freaked just to let go and
[2:03:17] rejoice in my freedom
[2:03:20] i went back to my seat feeling amazing i
[2:03:22] didn't rush the next day
[2:03:24] i was delivered from the complex
[2:03:30] thursday and all day friday it was
[2:03:32] really windy so my hair was all over the
[2:03:34] place
[2:03:35] i kept thinking about how terrible i
[2:03:36] probably looked and i was embarrassed
[2:03:38] like really embarrassed
[2:03:39] saturday wasn't too different concerning
[2:03:41] the wind but i didn't care it felt so
[2:03:43] good
[2:03:43] not to worry about what other people
[2:03:45] thought about me
[2:03:46] what did they think of me it wouldn't
[2:03:48] really change who i was or how i acted
[2:03:50] but the thought was always there it made
[2:03:52] me doubt myself
[2:03:54] and it really hindered me from a lot of
[2:03:55] things it hindered me from singing in
[2:03:57] church
[2:03:57] my family told me when i got home how
[2:03:59] they were really proud of me for letting
[2:04:01] go when i sing sunday morning
[2:04:02] to be honest it felt good to me too i
[2:04:05] love to sing but i've always doubted how
[2:04:06] i sounded
[2:04:07] it didn't matter what people told me
[2:04:09] i've always doubted myself
[2:04:11] but it felt so good to let go and praise
[2:04:14] him
[2:04:15] with the gift he gave me
[2:04:19] this ain't 50 years ago this is somebody
[2:04:21] in this building tonight
[2:04:33] because the devil's already trying to
[2:04:35] make me doubt it he's just so stupid
[2:04:37] he's done this before and he thinks i'm
[2:04:39] going to fall for it again
[2:04:41] but ain't he dumb
[2:04:46] testimony from camp it's just it's short
[2:04:49] but for me it's a big thing
[2:04:51] the devil been making me question in my
[2:04:53] mind if i had the holy ghost
[2:04:55] and when i went for prayer saturday
[2:04:56] night brother joe spoke to me
[2:04:58] and there was clarity and now i know
[2:05:01] that i know that i am filled
[2:05:02] now it's time to turn up my praise
[2:05:06] [Applause]
[2:05:17] [Applause]
[2:05:28] this is a church
[2:05:36] i came to camp with extreme nervousness
[2:05:38] and depression during the morning
[2:05:39] service god delivered me both
[2:05:41] during the night service god refilled me
[2:05:43] with the holy ghost
[2:05:44] i came to camp i came to camp with
[2:05:47] tormentors
[2:05:48] but i'm leaving completely free that's
[2:05:50] only a part of what god did for me
[2:05:52] he met me answered questions i'd only
[2:05:55] talk to him about
[2:05:56] falling in love with jesus causes
[2:05:59] everything else
[2:06:00] to fall into place i will never be the
[2:06:03] same
[2:06:09] brother god preaching in it do you
[2:06:11] remember saturday night with the holy
[2:06:13] ghost moved on to you
[2:06:14] to go tell brother wendell to call the
[2:06:15] spirit out remember he said
[2:06:17] brother joe coming back i'm trying to
[2:06:20] quit call the spirit now
[2:06:22] by the window tell them if they're
[2:06:24] battling pornography if they're battle
[2:06:26] battle lust
[2:06:26] so there's a there's a spirit i keep
[2:06:28] hearing over in this prayer life brother
[2:06:30] joe i guarantee you the devil battles
[2:06:31] your mind for going to doing that
[2:06:33] but can i give the devil a black guy for
[2:06:34] battle in your mind
[2:06:36] before a camp i had a problem with lust
[2:06:38] and pornography
[2:06:39] but saturday nights before i got in the
[2:06:41] prayer line for 20 minutes
[2:06:42] the devil kept on coming to tell me not
[2:06:44] to go in the parallel because i would be
[2:06:46] embarrassed with what i'd done
[2:06:47] after a while i didn't care how
[2:06:49] embarrassed i would be i got in the
[2:06:51] prayer line
[2:06:52] brother joe prayed for me and the holy
[2:06:54] ghost fell on me
[2:06:55] and delivered me in that spirit i went
[2:06:57] back to my seat
[2:06:58] i didn't feel so saved to come to you
[2:07:00] until you pray for me and while you were
[2:07:02] praying
[2:07:02] god came down and filled me with the
[2:07:05] holy spirit

[2:07:13] god of the message

[3:24:28] [Music]
[3:24:30] these men and women every one of them
[3:24:32] was full of new wife
[3:24:34] and if god has ever changed that program
[3:24:37] put your finger on the scripture
[3:24:39] it isn't there no sir
[3:24:42] it was plumb onto the end of the age
[3:24:44] that way plumb onto the end of the bible
[3:24:47] and it will be the same thing when jesus
[3:24:52] comes
[3:24:55] oh praise the name of the lord i have a
[3:24:58] right

[3:25:14] you know in this in this let me tell you
[3:25:17] a few more let's
[3:25:18] accumulate a couple more things there
[3:25:20] was a little baby that was brought up on
[3:25:22] the first night i believe it was maybe
[3:25:24] friday night
[3:25:26] had scabs all over his body from eczema
[3:25:30] just tore up everywhere scabs
[3:25:32] [Music]
[3:25:34] yes this is a baby given to a little
[3:25:36] couple over in amarillo texas been
[3:25:38] trying for
[3:25:39] some 10 or more years and god came on
[3:25:42] the scene and gave him a baby
[3:25:44] let's accumulate that a little
[3:25:46] [Music]
[3:25:49] we bit some white flags of victory here
[3:25:51] tonight
[3:25:52] he's still god he made the promise he's
[3:25:55] going to perform
[3:25:56] what he said he would do
[3:25:59] but the devil come and try to flick this
[3:26:01] little baby but had scabs all over
[3:26:04] his body and it's scratching himself to
[3:26:05] death we came we came up for prayer we
[3:26:08] laid our hands on it and cursed that
[3:26:09] thing
[3:26:10] by sunday morning scabs were falling off
[3:26:13] new skin was growing
[3:26:15] just as pink as it can be
[3:26:19] hallelujah i believe it was just a
[3:26:21] natural sign
[3:26:22] of what god also did in the spirit there
[3:26:25] was people that went there with scabs
[3:26:27] and scars
[3:26:28] and every kind of thing but the spirit
[3:26:30] of god came down and apart
[3:26:32] applies for bob and gillian and it took
[3:26:34] it all away
[3:26:36] and now i'm a new creator in christ
[3:26:47] blessed be the name of the lord
[3:26:50] let me tell you another one
[3:26:51] [Music]
[3:26:55] sister sarah beth she's not here tonight
[3:26:57] anything i thought she went but
[3:26:59] she was there at that meeting and over
[3:27:01] here on this side
[3:27:03] kind of like tonight was the spirit of
[3:27:05] god poured out on some girls and they
[3:27:07] fell out
[3:27:09] began to just get drunk
[3:27:13] just drunk
[3:27:16] a lot of underage drinking was going on
[3:27:18] there
[3:27:20] [Music]
[3:27:22] new wine found some of that new wine
[3:27:26] [Music]
[3:27:27] they found some of that original man
[3:27:29] fell on the day of pentecost
[3:27:31] and got them a couple mouthfuls
[3:27:35] sister sarah beth was one of them i
[3:27:36] actually when my daughter was there and
[3:27:38] i went over there
[3:27:39] after some time and knelt down beside
[3:27:41] her and was praying for
[3:27:42] there was a brother that was standing at
[3:27:44] the door and i asked him when i walked
[3:27:46] up i said what's going on here and he
[3:27:47] said you know
[3:27:48] i don't know i get just kind of just
[3:27:51] looking at it trying to figure it out
[3:27:52] because
[3:27:53] it was very astounding what god was
[3:27:55] doing
[3:27:56] and it was beyond normal
[3:28:00] amen but i like it when god breaks our
[3:28:02] normal stuff
[3:28:03] and our traditions and how what we think
[3:28:06] how the holy ghost ought to act
[3:28:10] i i kind of figured out i feel like in
[3:28:12] the bible where it says they were drunk
[3:28:14] they wasn't acting normal they accused
[3:28:17] him of getting on some bottles somewhere
[3:28:19] you know he said hey
[3:28:20] they're not drunk as you supposed
[3:28:24] but this is that that the prophet joel
[3:28:27] spoke about
[3:28:28] i'll pour out my spirit we witnessed
[3:28:31] that and that
[3:28:32] and i said i pulled katie up on the
[3:28:33] floor and sat on the bench there and was
[3:28:35] talking and praying with her
[3:28:37] and my you talking about drunk
[3:28:40] said how you doing katie i'm good
[3:28:47] i looked over there and there was this
[3:28:48] girl laid over in the other girl's lap
[3:28:50] and she's
[3:28:51] crying and out and i look around at her
[3:28:53] and i couldn't even tell who it was
[3:28:55] seemed like her countenance was changed
[3:28:57] last little sister that was
[3:28:59] in her lap i said who is that she said
[3:29:02] that's sarah beth
[3:29:04] i said wow i didn't even recognize her
[3:29:07] sister sarah beth wrote me on the way
[3:29:10] home
[3:29:12] she says i just want to let you know i
[3:29:15] really enjoyed the service last night
[3:29:17] i know many amazing things happened to
[3:29:20] people i've struggled with a lot of
[3:29:21] different health and stomach issues for
[3:29:23] years
[3:29:24] that i couldn't seem to get rid of i
[3:29:25] went to the doctor to doctor trying to
[3:29:27] figure it out
[3:29:28] was going on but nobody knew what was
[3:29:30] happening i felt sick to my stomach like
[3:29:32] i had to
[3:29:33] have had some sort of every every single
[3:29:36] time i've eaten
[3:29:37] every single day for years i got prayed
[3:29:40] for for all of it at our church and had
[3:29:42] faith that was gone but
[3:29:44] let the doubt in my mind come back and
[3:29:46] never i never let it go
[3:29:48] at the beginning of service i was
[3:29:49] thinking about all of it and thinking
[3:29:51] about how i didn't have to
[3:29:52] have that feeling of it but i knew i
[3:29:55] wanted my healing
[3:29:57] i told myself i'd know when i when it
[3:29:59] was gone without a doubt
[3:30:01] and i'm telling you after all of that i
[3:30:02] have no doubt in my mind that it's gone
[3:30:05] i'm just so happy i don't have to deal
[3:30:07] with any doctors
[3:30:08] any blood drawn or any stomach pain
[3:30:10] anymore ever since that
[3:30:12] service i haven't had one more stomach
[3:30:15] ache
[3:30:15] and i felt completely normal every time

[3:30:36] mercy brother wendell martin's mother
[3:30:40] was there
[3:30:41] sister darlene martin said mom has
[3:30:44] struggled with her platelet count for
[3:30:45] quite some time
[3:30:47] the platelets were what thickens the
[3:30:48] blood her platelets had been so low that
[3:30:50] blood
[3:30:51] was seeping through her skin she had
[3:30:53] problems with nosebleeds and blood in
[3:30:55] her stools
[3:30:56] been quite a roller coaster ride
[3:30:57] platelets coming up only to crash

[3:31:04] 000 her platelets have hovered around 7

[3:31:10] transfusions iron transfusion has been
[3:31:12] on oral medications as well as taking
[3:31:14] intravenous medicine one full day per
[3:31:16] week at the hospital

[3:31:20] something like 25 000 for a weekly shot
[3:31:23] and 11 000 per month for the oral
[3:31:25] medication
[3:31:26] a couple weeks ago the doctor decided to
[3:31:28] postpone her shots and intravenous
[3:31:31] injections for two weeks to see how low
[3:31:33] the platelets would fall
[3:31:35] we had prayer this last weekend she went
[3:31:37] to the doctor yesterday which was on
[3:31:38] monday
[3:31:39] to do blood work her platelets were 270
[3:31:43] 000.
[3:31:46] the doctor is beside himself he wants
[3:31:49] mom to come back in two weeks for more
[3:31:51] blood work
[3:31:52] and said he wants to start taking her
[3:31:53] off the medication as soon
