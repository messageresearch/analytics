[40:55] amen and amen god bless you
[40:59] turn with me to judges chapter 16 and
[41:01] we'll read from the 16th verse
[41:04] amen god has been so good to us and we
[41:07] so appreciate him
[41:09] good to see each one of you that has
[41:11] assembled with us today
[41:13] amen see brother kirkman sister amanda
[41:16] back there
[41:16] god bless you amen and the master's
[41:19] family over here god bless you
[41:21] amen so i'm glad to have you y'all in
[41:23] the service with us
[41:25] and those of you that hadn't been here
[41:26] for a while well we're glad you're here
[41:29] too
[41:29] amen genesis 16 16 and it came to pass
[41:33] when
[41:34] she meaning delilah pressed him daily
[41:37] with her words
[41:38] and urged him meaning samson so that his
[41:42] soul was vexed unto death that he told
[41:46] her
[41:46] all his heart and said unto her they
[41:49] hath not come a razor upon mine head
[41:52] for i have been a nice right unto god
[41:55] from my mother's womb if i be shaven
[41:57] then my strength will go from me and i
[41:59] will become
[42:00] weak and be like any other man
[42:04] and when delilah saw that he had told
[42:06] her all his hearts he sent and called
[42:08] the
[42:08] for the lords of the philistines saying
[42:11] come up
[42:12] at this once for he has shown me all his
[42:14] heart
[42:15] then the lords of the philistines came
[42:17] unto her and brought money in their hand
[42:20] and she made him sleep upon her knees
[42:22] and called for a man
[42:23] and she caused him to shave off all
[42:25] seven locks from his head
[42:27] and she began to afflict him and his
[42:30] strength
[42:30] went from him then she said the
[42:33] philistines be upon the samson
[42:36] and he awoke out of his sleep and said i
[42:38] will go out
[42:39] as at other times before and shake
[42:42] myself
[42:44] and he wished not the lord had departed
[42:46] from him
[42:48] but the philistines took him and put out
[42:50] his eyes and brought him down
[42:52] to gaza and bound him with fetters of
[42:55] brass and he did grind in the prison
[42:57] house
[42:59] howbeit the hair of his head began to
[43:01] grow again after he was shaven
[43:04] then the lords of the philistines
[43:06] gathered themselves them together to
[43:08] offer a great sacrifice unto digging
[43:10] their god and to rejoice
[43:12] for they said our god had delivered
[43:14] samson our enemy and our hand
[43:17] and when the people saw him they praised
[43:20] their god
[43:21] for they said our god hath delivered
[43:24] into our hands our
[43:25] enemies and the destroyer of our country
[43:28] which slew many of us
[43:30] and it came to pass when their hearts
[43:32] was merry and they
[43:34] said call for samson that he may make a
[43:36] sport
[43:37] and then he called samson out of the
[43:39] prison house and he made them sport
[43:42] and they set him between the pillars and
[43:45] samson
[43:45] said unto the lad that led him by the
[43:47] hand suffer me that i may feel the
[43:50] the pillars whereupon the house standeth
[43:53] that i may lean upon them now the house
[43:56] was full of
[43:57] men and women and all the lords of the
[43:59] philistines were there and
[44:02] there were upon the roof about three
[44:03] thousand men and women
[44:05] that beheld why samson made sport
[44:08] and samson called into the lord and said
[44:11] o lord god
[44:12] remember me i pray thee and strengthen
[44:15] me i pray thee only this once oh god
[44:17] that i may be
[44:18] at once amends to the philistines for my
[44:21] two eyes
[44:22] and samson took a hold of the two
[44:25] metal pillars upon which the house stood
[44:28] and on which it was born up
[44:30] of the one on his right hand and the
[44:32] other on his left
[44:33] and samson said let me die with the
[44:36] philistines
[44:37] and he bowed himself with all his might
[44:40] and the house fell upon the lords and
[44:42] upon the people therein
[44:45] so that the dead which he slew at his
[44:47] death
[44:48] was more than they which he slew
[44:51] in his life amen may god bless you you
[44:54] can be seated
[45:00] excuse me
[45:03] now today we're going to be speaking on
[45:07] again from the the little subject that
[45:10] we're holding
[45:11] dear to our heart of us being in the
[45:14] land of promise
[45:16] and um but this portion of it today is
[45:19] we're going to be speaking on
[45:21] is their hope of revival and we're going
[45:24] to be
[45:24] speaking of samson the type
[45:28] and brother bradham told us and god
[45:30] hiding himself in simplicity
[45:32] he said now you hear me if you believe
[45:36] me to be a messenger sent from christ
[45:39] to you you you believe me if not
[45:42] if you're not in the kingdom of god you
[45:44] better press right quick
[45:46] it will not get better it will grow
[45:49] worse
[45:50] all the time and certainly we can see
[45:53] the effects of that
[45:55] right now today said just mark it down
[45:57] just remember
[45:58] see whether it's right or wrong so you
[46:00] see if it's going to be
[46:02] right or wrong it's not going to get
[46:03] better it's going to get worse
[46:05] it's going to get harder all the time
[46:08] the revival is gone
[46:10] you're only cleaning in the field she's
[46:12] over now you say i disagree with that
[46:15] fine it's okay if you do that's all
[46:17] right but that's my conviction
[46:20] and that's my hearing from heaven i
[46:22] believe that laodicean age
[46:24] is the pentecostal age where she comes
[46:26] to the place
[46:28] of lukewarm and god spews her from her
[46:30] mouth from his mouth
[46:32] and there she's come right now the
[46:34] pentecostal movement has come down to
[46:35] that place
[46:37] lukewarm not red hot not ice cold
[46:40] you're not cold and formal neither are
[46:43] you
[46:43] hot you're spewing and you're in the
[46:45] spewing stage and you're going
[46:48] now of course as we
[46:51] um approach this subject here this
[46:54] morning and look into this thought
[46:56] is there hope a revival i would like to
[46:58] say
[46:59] sadly message churches are not
[47:02] exactly immune to this people
[47:05] are getting so hard and are not too
[47:08] tender
[47:09] and sensitive to the holy spirit but
[47:12] are lukewarm about it um you know
[47:15] as brother branham spoke about this in
[47:18] the message of shame this was
[47:20] july before he would depart from the
[47:23] from the earth in december and he said
[47:25] i told my wife and brother wood when i
[47:28] got here and some friends i met
[47:30] yesterday
[47:32] that i've had five years have hardly
[47:33] known what to do
[47:35] and it's nervous see that revival itself
[47:38] amongst the churches has died
[47:42] and everyone knows that you feel it in
[47:44] this tabernacle i want you to know
[47:46] it didn't just affect denominational
[47:48] churches
[47:50] but he was he was dealing with this in
[47:53] his own
[47:54] church and assembly he said
[47:57] that you feel it in this tabernacle you
[48:00] feel it everywhere
[48:01] there's a thump a dead feeling there's
[48:05] just something isn't right and
[48:06] it's because the revival enthusiasm
[48:10] has gone away from the people and they
[48:13] said you go into the churches and sit
[48:15] them
[48:16] see them sitting over there and this
[48:18] pastor is stumbling
[48:20] around for a message or something
[48:22] another and the first thing you know
[48:24] he's turned off to some kind of a party
[48:27] that they're going to have or something
[48:28] and it seems to be a dead thump
[48:31] everywhere
[48:33] and this was a condition that brother
[48:35] branham was finding
[48:36] in his church and in everywhere
[48:39] in the whole whole movement everywhere
[48:42] in that time in that era of time
[48:46] even um even as he would speak um
[48:50] in freeport and and would plead with god
[48:53] once more to send a revival to that
[48:57] place
[48:58] and he would he would remark in that in
[49:00] in like tabernacle
[49:02] he said but the church sits spiritually
[49:04] dead
[49:06] gone and the hour has passed them
[49:09] they're in a slump and hardly know what
[49:11] to do one running this way
[49:13] one running another way and hear every
[49:16] promise that god made
[49:18] in the bible every one of them is laying
[49:20] there just
[49:21] as good as they ever was it's the hour
[49:24] what makes a church like this
[49:26] we're in the age of laodicea when she
[49:29] has
[49:30] to come this way this is our fault
[49:34] now but you know we we also
[49:37] know that god is a god that likes
[49:40] to display his power amen
[49:44] you know not that he has to but he just
[49:46] has to
[49:48] it's like brother branham said in one
[49:50] place he said god loves to show his
[49:52] muscles
[49:53] to his children that i'm god and that i
[49:56] changed not
[49:58] and so it pleases him in his omnipotence
[50:02] to do this to
[50:04] just to let his subjects know who he is
[50:08] amen and um and we ought to be rejoicing
[50:12] about that this morning because he has
[50:14] shown us his power
[50:16] we have seen him in his power and i'll
[50:19] tell you i don't think we've seen all of
[50:21] it yet
[50:22] i think we're just on the cusp of some
[50:25] of the greatest things that's ever
[50:27] happened upon the face of the earth
[50:30] and we're seeing the precursor of it now
[50:32] as if god begins to move
[50:35] in his church and i was just i was just
[50:38] remarking today of um to michael about
[50:41] what a miracle even my wife is because i
[50:44] said i don't think
[50:46] we wrap our minds around what a miracle
[50:49] that we've just seen
[50:50] take place and and and doctors are
[50:54] testifying
[50:55] nurses are testifying it hardly ever
[50:58] happens
[50:59] and it is a miracle that has taken place
[51:02] that
[51:02] just in just in weeks time that she's
[51:05] back
[51:05] again in church and and and all body
[51:09] functions
[51:10] working because god is a god of miracles
[51:13] and he loves to display his power among
[51:16] us
[51:17] and so it what does this do it prepares
[51:20] our hearts
[51:22] amen it makes us ready it makes us brace
[51:24] up and ready to take a whole
[51:26] a new hold amen to say you know if god
[51:30] can
[51:30] will do that what else will he do he can
[51:33] do this
[51:34] for every situation my forever problem
[51:38] now of course brother branham said that
[51:41] the people who don't believe in divine
[51:43] healing and performing miracles
[51:45] no wonder our church has died no wonder
[51:47] they're withering
[51:48] up to bloodless cults
[51:52] and this describes those who say oh the
[51:55] lamb has
[51:56] left the mercy seat and you know they've
[51:58] become a
[51:59] bloodless cult when you deny the bloody
[52:02] the blood or the word that's the
[52:04] hour that you die and so no wonder
[52:08] that just a social gospel is
[52:10] predominating today
[52:13] it's because you know we're we're taking
[52:16] the
[52:16] the phenomenal away from god and hey
[52:19] if there ever was a time that we need
[52:22] the phenomenal in the supernatural
[52:25] it is now and and brother brandon said
[52:28] god himself is a phenomenal he is a
[52:31] creator
[52:32] being he is jehovah he's the great
[52:34] reality he's the great substance
[52:36] of everything that was made on the earth
[52:39] was made by him
[52:41] and he displays his power by raising the
[52:44] sun every morning by
[52:45] sending forth the rain by setting his
[52:47] rainbows
[52:48] but and comes down to his subjects and
[52:51] healing their sickness
[52:53] and saving their sins amen so wonderful
[52:56] how wonderful this is to think of that
[52:59] this
[53:00] god loves to show the phenomena
[53:03] to show the supernatural the message
[53:06] conference he said notice
[53:08] if the church if it's the church then
[53:11] when they obeyed what god said
[53:13] originally and it's the word of god look
[53:15] at the miracles
[53:16] and signs and so forth that they had
[53:19] speaking of the early church a
[53:21] church there he said and you you don't
[53:23] have them at all today it's an evidence
[53:25] that god is not with you so when we
[53:28] don't see
[53:29] the miraculous when we don't see god
[53:32] move among us come on that is an
[53:35] evidence god is not with us
[53:39] now again an uncertain sign brother
[53:42] branham says
[53:43] this and and this is a 1960s quote but
[53:46] listen it's very good
[53:47] uncertain sound he said now what kind of
[53:50] signs is going to follow them
[53:52] these signs well on some of them it'll
[53:54] follow perhaps they will maybe it will
[53:56] these signs shall follow them
[54:00] they will believe in healing they will
[54:02] believe in casting out devils
[54:05] they will believe in speaking with
[54:06] tongues or they'll believe in the
[54:08] supernatural works of
[54:10] god the resurrected jesus working with
[54:13] them
[54:13] is that the truth is that god's last
[54:15] word he's referring to
[54:17] mark 16 the last things that jesus said
[54:20] go into all the world preach the gospel
[54:22] and these signs shall follow them that
[54:24] believe so
[54:26] he said then cursed is he that tries to
[54:29] add to
[54:30] or take away from that it's just the way
[54:34] it is once the pentecostal church a
[54:36] noisy church
[54:38] back at the beginning when the holy
[54:40] ghost fell
[54:41] the virgin mary like she was drunk
[54:43] staggering under the power of god
[54:45] and all of them like that and the people
[54:47] said they're full of new wine
[54:49] that's such way the church was ordained
[54:53] and that's the way that every church is
[54:55] ordained
[54:57] and every time god has a church it'll be
[55:00] that same kind of a church
[55:04] hallelujah amen i'm just going to share
[55:07] some of these before we
[55:09] go into the message this morning
[55:10] second-handed robe
[55:12] brother branham said brother and sister
[55:14] the same thing has been done
[55:15] in the realms of the supernatural when
[55:18] they said
[55:18] divine healing cannot work the days of
[55:21] miracles
[55:22] has passed if the days of miracles has
[55:25] passed
[55:25] the days of god is passed the church
[55:29] that don't believe in the supernatural
[55:31] will finally die
[55:33] and god will leave that church
[55:37] amen and god gave the promise and god's
[55:39] promises is eternal
[55:42] so we must be a people that believes in
[55:44] the supernatural
[55:47] and believes the signs shall follow them
[55:50] that believe
[55:51] but as he said again he said it seemed
[55:54] like there's a dying
[55:56] out of the churches harder you can find
[55:58] a church anymore
[55:59] that's alive with the word and the
[56:01] spirit of god and great things taking
[56:03] place
[56:04] like it was not long ago now
[56:08] as i told you last sunday there are two
[56:10] thoughts
[56:11] that brother branham wove back and forth
[56:14] especially right after the seals back
[56:17] and forth
[56:18] as he just went into that and from 63
[56:21] into 64
[56:22] especially and i'm coming through 65
[56:25] right now
[56:26] but it it just it there are two thoughts
[56:29] that he interwove back and forth
[56:31] one was a thought that contained
[56:34] um that was contained and preached over
[56:37] and again and be not afraid
[56:39] and testimony on the sea go away jesus
[56:42] and others that dealt with the disciples
[56:44] were between revivals
[56:47] and understand that's where we're at we
[56:50] are between revivals
[56:52] we are between the revival of the divine
[56:55] healing movement
[56:57] and then the the final quickening of the
[56:59] rapture
[57:01] amen which that will be again another
[57:04] great
[57:05] move of the spirit the dynamics of this
[57:07] church will be a refilling of the holy
[57:09] ghost
[57:10] that we have worked in a small measure
[57:12] while the headstone has come down to
[57:14] unite with the body
[57:16] but when it comes down it'll come down
[57:18] he said with the full power and razor up
[57:20] that even the dead in christ will be
[57:21] raised
[57:23] so so again these these are these are
[57:26] things that
[57:27] are promised and we are in the last day
[57:30] revival
[57:31] and it will crescendo
[57:34] into the chains of our body and the
[57:38] rapture of the church
[57:40] amen so we are you know we're not
[57:42] looking for it to get less
[57:46] we're looking for into crescendo
[57:49] that the things that we begin to see
[57:51] among us of god working in the
[57:53] miraculous
[57:55] that he will continue working that
[57:57] miraculous
[57:58] until our bodies are changed and that is
[58:01] the
[58:02] ultimate of ultimate miraculous
[58:05] amen now so you again
[58:09] there was then the other thought was
[58:12] samson crying out once more
[58:15] lord and brother branham would use him
[58:18] as a type
[58:19] of what had happened to the church and
[58:22] for what
[58:23] us for what for us to expect
[58:26] in this last day are you with me
[58:29] now so he preached a sermon on samson as
[58:32] as the present state of the church this
[58:35] is the present state
[58:37] and he showed where the church was in a
[58:41] condition
[58:41] a deceived church by the world
[58:45] of being blinded and defeated
[58:48] and even coming down to where it would
[58:51] be
[58:52] afraid of the new birth
[58:55] now let me stop there just for a moment
[58:57] and remember brother brandon said it
[58:59] it would turn us into a it would turn us
[59:02] into a
[59:02] bloodless cult
[59:05] and remember a bloodless cult is one who
[59:08] has no blood the holy ghost isn't there
[59:12] the power and the life of jesus isn't
[59:15] there
[59:16] and there is one thing that makes us
[59:18] different
[59:19] between will make us difference between
[59:22] the church and the bride
[59:24] is the token which is the blood which is
[59:27] the holy ghost
[59:28] which is the power of god and all that
[59:30] it contains
[59:32] are you with me now so the church
[59:36] will will never will never overcome
[59:40] they'll wind up in the tribulation but
[59:42] there's a
[59:43] new crop
[59:50] that is going to avenge oh hallelujah
[59:54] that is going to put vengeance upon the
[59:57] devil and offends the blood of the
[59:58] saints
[59:59] by resurrection of all the saints coming
[1:00:03] forth
[1:00:05] hallelujah those that went down in the
[1:00:08] fire
[1:00:08] and burnt to ashes and those that were
[1:00:11] were
[1:00:12] were persecuted and tormented
[1:00:15] and all of that will be raised
[1:00:23] you are living in the most exciting
[1:00:25] times that there's ever been
[1:00:30] and you must not be lukewarm about it
[1:00:34] because that dams you to the tribulation
[1:00:44] as we look at this let's look at this
[1:00:48] soberly and sincerely
[1:00:52] and nothing nobody looked at us was
[1:00:53] pride of we the people we're
[1:00:56] this we're this you make your own call
[1:00:58] in an election sure
[1:01:04] do not think for a moment that any of us
[1:01:08] can rest on the laurels of our past
[1:01:16] let's see what are we now where are we
[1:01:20] walking now
[1:01:21] what's our level of of of of um
[1:01:26] of fervency and zeal now
[1:01:34] now as we come to this
[1:01:38] these two thoughts that brother branham
[1:01:40] would talk about
[1:01:42] he would first preach it at his own
[1:01:44] tabernacle
[1:01:47] and this would begin in 1959 when he
[1:01:50] would preach it
[1:01:51] for the first time a deceived church by
[1:01:54] the world
[1:01:55] and in this he would speak directly to
[1:01:58] his own church now
[1:02:00] this is different than speaking out here
[1:02:03] to the denominational world and telling
[1:02:05] them where they're an era
[1:02:08] this is starting right there in the very
[1:02:11] in the very
[1:02:12] heart of the bride movement
[1:02:16] where that he would where he would put
[1:02:19] out a warning of a deceived
[1:02:21] church by the world and he would use
[1:02:24] samson as the type
[1:02:28] um and let me just and i've shared this
[1:02:31] quote before
[1:02:32] and i hope i haven't worn it out to you
[1:02:34] but let's look at it a little deeper
[1:02:37] today as we go in here
[1:02:39] in a deceived church by the world but he
[1:02:41] said the reason people go
[1:02:43] and join organizations and substitute a
[1:02:46] handshake instead of the new birth
[1:02:49] they're trying to bypass the new birth
[1:02:52] they don't want the new birth
[1:02:55] and they know we teach it in the bible
[1:02:58] so they want to substitute something for
[1:03:00] it
[1:03:00] and the pentecostal people are just as
[1:03:02] bad trying to substitute something
[1:03:05] they want it in class it must be so
[1:03:09] classy i wonder if that's what we've
[1:03:12] done with it when we make the new birth
[1:03:15] today just saying we believe brother
[1:03:17] bran i'm a prophet and we believe the
[1:03:19] message and oh you've got it
[1:03:21] we wanted it classy
[1:03:25] we shake hands and join the church and
[1:03:27] be a sprinkle or baptized or something
[1:03:30] they're afraid of the new birth and he
[1:03:32] said i sometimes believe
[1:03:34] that branham tabernacle's getting afraid
[1:03:36] of it
[1:03:39] so he could identify it already the
[1:03:42] spirit of it
[1:03:44] right in the movement
[1:03:47] you see because every time there's a
[1:03:50] move of god there's also an antichrist
[1:03:53] spirit that tries to move in there with
[1:03:55] it
[1:03:57] to make the church lukewarm and formal
[1:04:00] and powerless
[1:04:02] and we must by god's spirit discern
[1:04:05] and withstand the antichrist spirit
[1:04:11] somebody with me now now i mean i i know
[1:04:14] because we've had we've had great
[1:04:17] churches even
[1:04:18] maine mainstream i'm talking about not
[1:04:20] fanatical this way or that way
[1:04:22] mainstream
[1:04:23] message churches where you know in
[1:04:25] meetings that were
[1:04:26] where people were invited to receive the
[1:04:29] holy ghost and
[1:04:30] people would come and you know have some
[1:04:32] would have an experience with god and
[1:04:35] at the end man get up and minister get
[1:04:37] up and say well
[1:04:38] now how many got the holy ghost and how
[1:04:40] many don't think you did
[1:04:42] and now i'm going to show you where you
[1:04:43] did you see if you believe the message
[1:04:46] you've already got it
[1:04:50] and that man today has turned against
[1:04:52] the message
[1:04:53] and is blaspheming the truth of god
[1:05:00] are you with me that same man
[1:05:03] is right back into his easy believism
[1:05:06] you know
[1:05:06] dressing and looking and behaving in
[1:05:09] different ways it should never be
[1:05:11] to administer the gospel
[1:05:15] are you with me i mean it hadn't worked
[1:05:20] in fact to the matter is this it's
[1:05:22] really blasphemy to say
[1:05:24] i believe the message i got the holy
[1:05:26] ghost
[1:05:28] amen you know again you know
[1:05:31] believing the message is not your
[1:05:33] salvation
[1:05:34] it's an experience of personal
[1:05:37] experience
[1:05:37] with jesus christ
[1:05:42] now again he says in there i believe
[1:05:44] that branham tabernacle is
[1:05:46] god getting afraid of it and he said now
[1:05:49] we all know
[1:05:50] that a birth i don't care where it is so
[1:05:53] where or whereabouts it's a mess
[1:05:56] if a baby's born on a shuck pile
[1:05:59] or a hard floor or pink decorated
[1:06:01] hospital room
[1:06:02] it's a mess anyhow a birth of a cow
[1:06:05] birth of anything is a else is a mess
[1:06:08] and brother brad is using the analogy of
[1:06:11] the natural birth
[1:06:12] water blood spirit right
[1:06:16] and he said it's a mess now yeah
[1:06:20] and i know there'd be those who said
[1:06:21] well but that was a 59 and
[1:06:23] brother bradham changed well in 1965
[1:06:26] he's still using that analogy
[1:06:29] and he said the new birds is nothing
[1:06:32] less than a mess
[1:06:34] but people are so starchy we're going to
[1:06:37] get some starch out some collards today
[1:06:40] amen we'll go over there where they'll
[1:06:42] shake hands we'll go over there
[1:06:44] where they don't bawl and cry and beat
[1:06:47] on the altar and cry out
[1:06:49] and you hear people say whoa we're so
[1:06:51] glad to have them kind of meetings you
[1:06:53] know
[1:06:53] where there's no nobody crying and
[1:06:56] nobody balling out at the altar and
[1:06:57] whatever but
[1:06:58] you know something that just made
[1:07:00] everybody feel good
[1:07:04] he said you want to be too human what we
[1:07:07] need is a
[1:07:08] is a birth to dine out to bring forth a
[1:07:11] life
[1:07:12] he said don't sleep of seed and all
[1:07:14] potatoes seed potatoes you gotta
[1:07:16] take that potato and put it in the
[1:07:18] ground until you can have new potatoes
[1:07:20] natto potato
[1:07:21] has to rot a corn cannot produce new
[1:07:24] life
[1:07:25] until it's rotten and a man or a woman
[1:07:28] cannot never have a new birth until
[1:07:32] their intellectuals
[1:07:33] and their own self is dead and rotten
[1:07:37] and die out at the altar and scream
[1:07:40] and get all messed up to a place that
[1:07:43] the formality
[1:07:44] or the starches get out of your collar
[1:07:46] that's formality inadequate
[1:07:50] and orders and church orders come on
[1:07:54] and he said and you're born again by the
[1:07:56] spirit of god he said i don't care if
[1:07:57] you squall
[1:07:58] speak in tongues jump up and down flop
[1:08:02] like a chicken with his head off
[1:08:03] you're bringing forth new life
[1:08:06] but we substituted something for it we
[1:08:09] want the classical
[1:08:11] way i'm getting at the root of the
[1:08:13] problem
[1:08:15] why we're lacking revival
[1:08:18] because people have never been revived
[1:08:22] they've never had their own revival 1964
[1:08:25] who is jesus he talks about
[1:08:27] zacchaeus you remember his story of
[1:08:29] zacchaeus you know getting the garbage
[1:08:31] can
[1:08:31] and and getting himself all dirty
[1:08:33] getting up in the tree and
[1:08:35] and all that and he's talking about a
[1:08:36] mess garbage all over me secluded site
[1:08:39] and
[1:08:39] he said sometimes god just has to let
[1:08:42] you get that
[1:08:44] i heard somebody say you know their new
[1:08:46] way
[1:08:47] now here's brother branham concerned
[1:08:50] about this
[1:08:50] new way i hope it never gets
[1:08:54] in our pentecostal realms and it's all
[1:08:57] over the message realms now
[1:09:02] though i see it leaking in shake hands i
[1:09:04] take jesus as my personal savior
[1:09:08] i like to see them get down there at the
[1:09:11] altar and die beat
[1:09:15] and squall and slobber come on
[1:09:19] you know we used to have some horses
[1:09:21] when we fed them clover that real pretty
[1:09:23] sweet clover honey in it
[1:09:25] it made them slobber when you get close
[1:09:28] enough to canaan you'll slobber a little
[1:09:30] too you know
[1:09:31] eating that honey out of canaan
[1:09:35] amen i i like to see preaching like that
[1:09:39] where we preach it in such a way people
[1:09:41] get to slobber
[1:09:44] i'm going to confess something right
[1:09:46] here i'm going to confess
[1:09:48] something you know i i i rebuked myself
[1:09:50] for it
[1:09:51] a whole lot a lot of times but it's got
[1:09:53] to worry anymore that i
[1:09:55] i look at my plate of food that we
[1:09:58] usually fix a plate and set it at the
[1:10:00] table and we sit down to eat
[1:10:02] and i look at that plate of food and
[1:10:04] then i go to praying
[1:10:06] and my juices start running
[1:10:09] and i'm wiping my chin before i can quit
[1:10:11] praying
[1:10:15] wouldn't it be wonderful amen if we got
[1:10:18] here in the church
[1:10:21] and people started eating the good word
[1:10:23] of god
[1:10:25] and the juices just start running all
[1:10:27] over you begin to
[1:10:29] saliva trade and desire and say give me
[1:10:32] some more of this i can't wait
[1:10:34] lord pour it out fill me with your
[1:10:36] spirit
[1:10:37] invigorate me energize me get this food
[1:10:40] on the inside of me
[1:10:53] you know their new way just say i
[1:10:56] believe the message
[1:10:59] i believe brother bannon was a prophet
[1:11:01] oh yeah yeah you got the revelation you
[1:11:03] you're
[1:11:03] you're in you oh i believe the thunders
[1:11:05] i believe this
[1:11:06] i believe the perugia oh yeah yeah
[1:11:08] you're in you're good boy come on just
[1:11:10] you
[1:11:10] you'll get over that pornography one day
[1:11:16] you know what we're criticizing most
[1:11:17] about youth camp
[1:11:20] our altar calls
[1:11:26] say it's only a motion
[1:11:30] in time evangelism brother branham said
[1:11:33] it this way
[1:11:34] he said the scientific theory of the
[1:11:36] modern so-called religious groups
[1:11:39] has tried to prove that this blessed
[1:11:42] thing we have
[1:11:43] called the holy spirit his only emotion
[1:11:48] see it just don't stand up according to
[1:11:49] their scientific theory but i'd like to
[1:11:52] ask them
[1:11:52] what makes them change
[1:11:56] what makes the drunkard stop drinking
[1:12:00] what makes a prostitute cease her evil
[1:12:02] life
[1:12:04] what makes the cancer and diseases
[1:12:07] depart from the
[1:12:08] people and the deaf dumb and blind and
[1:12:10] the dead to raise up
[1:12:12] explain that is that emotion
[1:12:15] it has emotion with it certainly
[1:12:18] anything that's alive has emotion and
[1:12:20] anything that doesn't have emotion is
[1:12:22] dead
[1:12:23] excuse the expression but i think we
[1:12:26] ought to bury
[1:12:27] some of our emotionless religion then
[1:12:30] because
[1:12:31] because that is dead it has no emotion
[1:12:34] to it
[1:12:35] any religion that has not emotion should
[1:12:38] be
[1:12:38] buried you see because it is emotional
[1:12:43] jesus when he entered the city and the
[1:12:45] the children and them and all the
[1:12:46] friends
[1:12:47] crying hosanna him that cometh in the
[1:12:50] name of the lord and
[1:12:51] those religionists of that day couldn't
[1:12:53] stand it
[1:12:54] it was too emotional said if they hold
[1:12:57] their peace the rocks
[1:12:59] will immediately cry out see something
[1:13:02] must cry out
[1:13:03] because there's life in it but you say
[1:13:06] brother tell me you know
[1:13:08] we've got the word today the word the
[1:13:10] word but when david saw
[1:13:12] the word the ark returning
[1:13:15] he danced before the lord is that right
[1:13:19] amen he rejoiced because the word was
[1:13:22] coming back
[1:13:24] and there his wife got embarrassed of
[1:13:27] his
[1:13:27] dancing and shouting and rejoicing in
[1:13:30] front of all
[1:13:31] israel said you didn't look dignified
[1:13:34] like a
[1:13:34] king you know you you disgrace the
[1:13:37] king's office
[1:13:38] acting the way you're doing and you
[1:13:40] you've cut up like that and misbehaved
[1:13:43] in a presence and she just scolded him
[1:13:46] real good
[1:13:46] because she was embarrassed
[1:13:50] and god cursed that woman with a curse
[1:13:53] [Applause]
[1:13:54] you know what the curse was no children
[1:13:58] that's right that was a cursing that day
[1:14:01] today oh it's the end thing to do
[1:14:03] but in that day it was a curse not to
[1:14:05] have children
[1:14:08] amen you died you're you're we you know
[1:14:10] you you had no progeny to go on
[1:14:13] and they realized the value of life
[1:14:17] and that that lineage died right there
[1:14:21] because why a woman left and stormed
[1:14:25] the rejoicing because the ark was
[1:14:28] returning
[1:14:30] and the penalty is somebody with me the
[1:14:33] penalty for
[1:14:34] storming and laughing at holy ghost
[1:14:37] singing
[1:14:38] and holy ghost rejoicing will mean
[1:14:40] you'll have no
[1:14:41] children it'll be a barren church
[1:14:44] [Applause]
[1:14:50] that's a curse because we're to bring
[1:14:54] forth sons and daughters to god
[1:14:57] amen oh my
[1:15:00] think of that god hates the powerless
[1:15:03] religion
[1:15:05] brother branham kept saying that all the
[1:15:06] way down past the way past the seals
[1:15:09] their
[1:15:10] religion has no power so what he must do
[1:15:13] in this day every time the bible got
[1:15:15] outside of the
[1:15:16] outside this side the bible every time
[1:15:18] there come a
[1:15:19] reformation revival it was backed with
[1:15:22] great signs and powers
[1:15:24] when luther came forth when wesley came
[1:15:26] forth when all the reformers thank you
[1:15:28] finn and knox calvin
[1:15:29] whoever when they come forth there was
[1:15:31] power demonstrated
[1:15:33] where god is he's supernatural
[1:15:36] where god displays itself there's got to
[1:15:39] be supernatural
[1:15:42] amen so my question is today
[1:15:45] does the true church have this truth
[1:15:49] to produce the atmosphere
[1:15:52] where souls can be born in the kingdom
[1:15:56] remember the days of hezekiah ii king 19
[1:15:59] 3 and he saw that day as a day of
[1:16:02] blasphemy
[1:16:03] and he said they said to him thus saith
[1:16:05] hezekiah
[1:16:06] this day is a day of trouble and a
[1:16:09] rebuke
[1:16:10] and a blasphemy for the children are
[1:16:12] come to the birth
[1:16:13] and there's not enough strength to bring
[1:16:15] forth
[1:16:18] amen
[1:16:22] give us a little more air up here
[1:16:24] timothy yes
[1:16:27] no strength no atmosphere
[1:16:33] churches can be so ice-cold
[1:16:39] ah you're a little cool this morning
[1:16:46] you're gonna make me fight for this
[1:16:47] sermon
[1:16:50] i'll fight every devil in hell for this
[1:16:52] one
[1:16:55] amen
[1:16:59] now as we think of this
[1:17:02] atmosphere atmosphere is going to be so
[1:17:06] important for revival without
[1:17:09] atmosphere there's no healing got to be
[1:17:12] an atmosphere of faith
[1:17:13] without atmosphere there's no salvation
[1:17:16] there's got to be an atmosphere of faith
[1:17:20] of believing are you with me amen so
[1:17:23] so again it's the atmosphere that does
[1:17:26] it
[1:17:27] even even brother bowser said you know
[1:17:29] it's not the hen
[1:17:31] he said it's the atmosphere he said you
[1:17:34] can put that
[1:17:35] that under a pup and the atmosphere
[1:17:38] would hatch an egg
[1:17:39] you put it in an incubator and the
[1:17:42] atmosphere if you got the humidity right
[1:17:44] and the temperature right
[1:17:45] it'll it'll hatch those eggs
[1:17:49] right amen you but again what we
[1:17:52] need is a holy ghost atmosphere
[1:17:56] amen an atmosphere where the power of
[1:17:58] god is moving
[1:18:00] hey my word we're in one one accord
[1:18:05] come on together under that atmosphere
[1:18:07] what kind of accord brother jim
[1:18:09] expecting god to do things
[1:18:13] and do signs and wonders amen
[1:18:16] moving up into that bracket and stepping
[1:18:18] up in that page
[1:18:19] where we're where that we get into the
[1:18:22] dimensions
[1:18:23] where all things are possible
[1:18:30] now but you know it'll never happen
[1:18:34] like that or it's more difficult to
[1:18:36] happen
[1:18:37] you get people that are resenting this
[1:18:39] and that
[1:18:43] you know i remember and i'm not rebuking
[1:18:46] you i'm just
[1:18:47] making you observe something but when we
[1:18:50] first had our first services back
[1:18:51] we had to we had to be told where to sit
[1:18:54] and out of space and
[1:18:56] you know spacing out and through this
[1:18:58] building and
[1:18:59] people we were americans we didn't like
[1:19:01] it
[1:19:04] it was all strange and different and
[1:19:07] whatever it took about
[1:19:08] three or four services to get a good
[1:19:09] atmosphere again
[1:19:11] to get rid of the resentment
[1:19:14] because god will not bless a resenting
[1:19:17] audience
[1:19:20] are you with me amen but when we get in
[1:19:22] one accord
[1:19:25] amen the more that we can get in the one
[1:19:27] accord the more that we can see the
[1:19:29] spirit move
[1:19:31] you know you get one of them there now
[1:19:33] it's time to go we got one
[1:19:35] i hope you don't preach on that today
[1:19:36] you got one i don't like what he said
[1:19:38] there
[1:19:40] i remember if you get people in one
[1:19:42] accord
[1:19:44] where everybody is pulling the same way
[1:19:47] god speak to us today am i don't leave
[1:19:50] me behind whatever you do
[1:19:52] i want to be blessed too if you're
[1:19:54] blessing this when i'm not scorned and
[1:19:56] i'm i'm saying god bless me dude
[1:19:58] don't pass me back cut my way jesus
[1:20:02] [Applause]
[1:20:03] amen well you s where you just
[1:20:06] look and you say i'm expecting great
[1:20:09] things
[1:20:10] amen and that expectancy will get that
[1:20:13] unity among the people
[1:20:16] that's what happened on the day of
[1:20:18] pentecost that's what brought the holy
[1:20:20] ghost down the first place
[1:20:22] they went up there in 10 days and nights
[1:20:24] and until they were all in one place and
[1:20:26] with one accord blessing god
[1:20:30] for something they didn't have
[1:20:34] don't hang up on me i want you to get
[1:20:37] this
[1:20:38] real loud and clear they were blessing
[1:20:41] god
[1:20:44] not for the miracles they've seen but
[1:20:47] for what they didn't have

[1:23:43] ghost which had not come yet
[1:23:46] but they believed it they believed god
[1:23:48] was going to keep his promise
[1:23:51] and when they kept blessing god they
[1:23:53] kept blessing them till the atmosphere
[1:23:55] got right
[1:23:57] oh brother 10.
[1:24:01] do you know you can take a good seed
[1:24:06] plant it in good ground
[1:24:10] but for that seed different seeds takes
[1:24:13] different atmospheres right
[1:24:17] so you know you plant some things and
[1:24:20] say and out of season
[1:24:23] sometimes they won't even germinate
[1:24:26] until
[1:24:26] the temperature gets right
[1:24:30] till the atmosphere gets right come on
[1:24:33] somebody
[1:24:34] now we got promises in the word and you
[1:24:36] say well why don't they work i planted
[1:24:38] them
[1:24:39] well did you get the atmosphere right
[1:24:42] is faith there predominating the
[1:24:45] atmosphere
[1:24:46] to change that seed from a promise
[1:24:49] to fulfillment
[1:24:51] [Music]
[1:24:56] hallelujah
[1:25:02] i said hallelujah
[1:25:06] can anybody else say hallelujah about
[1:25:09] that
[1:25:09] then let's say god help me today to
[1:25:11] create an atmosphere
[1:25:14] say brother jim you're trying to work us
[1:25:16] up i'm trying to get you to elevate your
[1:25:19] faith
[1:25:19] to rise another bracket so that there
[1:25:22] could be an atmosphere in this place
[1:25:24] where all things are possible to them
[1:25:27] that believe
[1:25:29] and it happens when you start praising
[1:25:32] god for what has not yet
[1:25:34] happened
[1:25:38] hallelujah i'm praising god for baron to
[1:25:40] give birth
[1:25:41] i'm praising god for prodigals to return
[1:25:46] i'm praising god for cancers to be
[1:25:49] healed
[1:25:50] come on i'm praising god for a good
[1:25:53] report this week
[1:25:54] as we come up to the week of tests in
[1:25:57] august
[1:25:57] for brother ron spencer i'm praising god
[1:26:00] for keyless
[1:26:01] and firemen over covenant virus
[1:26:08] praising god for your children and your
[1:26:10] children's children
[1:26:12] and your mother and your daddy or
[1:26:14] whoever's a far off
[1:26:15] as many as the lord i got some call i'm
[1:26:18] praising him for it
[1:26:23] and when the atmosphere got right there
[1:26:26] came a sound from heaven
[1:26:28] like a rusty mighty wind and it filled
[1:26:30] the house
[1:26:32] and all them were sitting got visited by
[1:26:35] a pillar of fire
[1:26:37] [Music]
[1:26:42] are you ready for your visitation
[1:26:54] this analogy brother branham uses of a
[1:26:56] birth being a mess
[1:26:59] he uses it to explain the new birth
[1:27:03] all the way up till his departure
[1:27:08] from from from the early years all the
[1:27:10] way up into 1965.
[1:27:14] before the seals and after the seals
[1:27:16] notice
[1:27:18] this quotation i read from
[1:27:21] from a deceived church by the world
[1:27:25] brother branham mentioned the altar
[1:27:29] two times you know he
[1:27:32] mentioned there about die out at the
[1:27:34] altar and scream get all messed up to
[1:27:36] places
[1:27:37] to till the starts gets out of your
[1:27:40] collar
[1:27:41] he said we'll go over where they don't
[1:27:43] ball and cry and beat on the altar and
[1:27:45] cry out those
[1:27:46] are the two times that it refers to the
[1:27:49] altar
[1:27:51] my question has been does the church
[1:27:55] does it the church have the strength
[1:27:58] to bring forth do we have strength in
[1:28:00] this age
[1:28:02] to push back the lukewarmness
[1:28:07] and the coldness of this age and become
[1:28:10] the church that jesus said would be an
[1:28:14] invincible army that the gates of hell
[1:28:16] would not prevail against
[1:28:19] do we have it can the church do it
[1:28:24] twice he mentions the altar
[1:28:27] in branham tabernacle sadly to say
[1:28:32] there hasn't been an altered call in the
[1:28:33] branham tabernacle for years now
[1:28:37] literally for years
[1:28:40] and man the branham tabernacle the voice
[1:28:42] of god is not a representation of this
[1:28:44] message
[1:28:47] that's right their light has gone out
[1:28:52] well we don't believe in altars that's
[1:28:54] just a methodist tradition
[1:28:56] yeah i know i've been in message
[1:29:00] churches where the altar was taken out
[1:29:02] of the church
[1:29:04] set in the basement or just like brother
[1:29:07] branham said it would be
[1:29:08] or out in the back room somewhere when i
[1:29:11] built this church i said i want an altar
[1:29:13] to go from here to there
[1:29:14] and i want tears on this altar
[1:29:18] amen you know what sure brother branham
[1:29:21] was against using
[1:29:22] sentimental reasons to come remember
[1:29:24] your mother died and
[1:29:26] and she would want you to go to the
[1:29:28] altar and get saved and
[1:29:29] oh mama wants you to be a good boy once
[1:29:31] you go down and give your heart to
[1:29:32] christ
[1:29:33] you know and you do it for mama or you
[1:29:35] do it because
[1:29:36] some other reason sentimental you and
[1:29:38] i've been friends a long time
[1:29:40] why not go down to altar with me and get
[1:29:42] saved it never works
[1:29:47] but it can please god some time to have
[1:29:49] an altar call
[1:29:50] brother branham said in 1964 i believe
[1:29:53] god's going to do some great things
[1:29:54] tomorrow i'm hoping he is
[1:29:56] that's the reason i make altar calls do
[1:29:58] everything i can
[1:30:00] to find favor with him
[1:30:03] so an altar called be done brings favor
[1:30:07] with god
[1:30:09] oh yeah you know you say but it's a
[1:30:11] tradition there's a lot of things that
[1:30:13] are traditions
[1:30:15] we come to church on sunday and
[1:30:16] wednesday that's a tradition
[1:30:19] that's a custom of ours to come and
[1:30:21] honor the resurrection it's a tradition
[1:30:23] but it's a good one right
[1:30:26] yes amen we break into midweek it's our
[1:30:29] tradition to break in the
[1:30:31] midweek to come to church and break into
[1:30:34] midweek to
[1:30:35] to fear get on something spiritual and
[1:30:37] face the
[1:30:38] the weekend right well then we have
[1:30:41] sunday to face the rest of
[1:30:43] the the week coming up and honor the
[1:30:45] resurrection
[1:30:47] a tradition but he said in testimony on
[1:30:52] the sea in 64
[1:30:53] we've gone off without the old-time
[1:30:55] prayer meetings and the baptism of the
[1:30:57] holy ghost coming back
[1:30:58] until the fire burnt low you can cry out
[1:31:02] and try to get people to they all turn
[1:31:04] they'll just walk up like they were dead
[1:31:06] a dread to come and then ask ministers
[1:31:08] to come pray with them
[1:31:09] and oh he said what do you call me for
[1:31:12] and they get down there and you can
[1:31:14] hardly get them and they stand there
[1:31:15] just a few minutes and look up at you
[1:31:17] and
[1:31:17] go back and sit down in the seat he said
[1:31:19] to me the fire is going out
[1:31:22] something has happened listen what we
[1:31:24] need is revival
[1:31:26] that sinners looking upon christ repent
[1:31:28] run to the altar with their hands up
[1:31:30] screaming for mercy
[1:31:31] and the whole church is a flame of fire
[1:31:34] with the glory of god
[1:31:36] he says in 63 he said what the world
[1:31:39] needs today is a good old time
[1:31:41] saint paul's revival and the bible the
[1:31:44] holy ghost back again
[1:31:46] where the spirit of god falls among the
[1:31:48] people and signs and wonders appear
[1:31:50] like sparks off of an anvil yes sir we
[1:31:53] need it
[1:31:53] that's what we have to have it hold
[1:31:56] together
[1:31:58] now nowadays we got the new way we're
[1:32:01] just born
[1:32:02] by natural birth into the message and
[1:32:04] you know we want to help them out of the
[1:32:06] shell and so on and
[1:32:08] you can't help with the way you're
[1:32:09] living you know you just live in this
[1:32:11] whole flesh and
[1:32:12] you can't overcome the flesh
[1:32:18] and we try to help them
[1:32:22] help them out make it a little easier on
[1:32:26] it's like picking a chick out of the
[1:32:28] shell
[1:32:29] we kill them
[1:32:32] somebody with me amen what we
[1:32:36] need is an old-fashioned prayer altar
[1:32:38] where they pray through i'm quoting your
[1:32:39] prophet
[1:32:40] until using themselves to come in god's
[1:32:43] provided way
[1:32:44] they free themselves from the world
[1:32:47] that's exactly right you know
[1:32:50] even eagle has to say we're eagles by
[1:32:52] the time we're not a chick we're an
[1:32:53] eagle well even eagle has to pip his way
[1:32:55] out
[1:32:57] that's right you know again there he is
[1:33:00] as he tries to to pick to pimp his way
[1:33:03] out and beat his way out of that old
[1:33:05] shell
[1:33:06] you know what happens we hear well days
[1:33:07] and miracles are passed you don't have
[1:33:09] to do that anymore
[1:33:10] you know we we we we got a more
[1:33:12] dignified way of coming today
[1:33:14] but but again the nature within it says
[1:33:17] peck a hole in it it might knock a hole
[1:33:21] in it and he begins to knock until he
[1:33:23] gets a little bit
[1:33:24] of that atmosphere in the shell
[1:33:29] and he says i know there's a better
[1:33:31] world out there
[1:33:32] because i got some of that atmosphere
[1:33:36] coming down in my shell and begins to
[1:33:39] beat on that
[1:33:40] until it it finally breaks out of the
[1:33:42] shelf
[1:33:44] amen and he practically on that cell as
[1:33:46] hard as he can
[1:33:48] satan get away from here amen i'm coming
[1:33:50] out here i'm not laying in this whole
[1:33:52] shell anymore
[1:33:54] amen i'm pimping my way out because i'm
[1:33:56] an eagle
[1:33:57] [Applause]
[1:33:59] amen how do you pick your way out thus
[1:34:02] saith the lord god saith the lord god
[1:34:04] said the lord
[1:34:05] you've made me a promised lord the
[1:34:07] devil's over here saying
[1:34:08] i'll give up you know you'll never get
[1:34:11] the holy ghost and you knock a little
[1:34:12] harder
[1:34:14] [Music]
[1:34:15] come on you say brother tim but that
[1:34:18] ain't the way it happens it is the way
[1:34:20] it happened brother branham said when i
[1:34:21] got saved
[1:34:22] he said i began to cry said god save me
[1:34:25] somehow save me what have you got to do
[1:34:27] save me and he said the devil said to me
[1:34:30] you have already sinned away your day of
[1:34:32] grace and he said i used it against him
[1:34:36] and i said oh god i know i may have send
[1:34:39] away my day of grace but i'm coming on
[1:34:41] anyhow
[1:34:42] and he said i pecked my way into the
[1:34:44] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:34:51] amen
[1:34:58] let me get to my subject all of that's
[1:35:01] preview
[1:35:06] how to view things get off my chest
[1:35:11] get you ready in an atmosphere
[1:35:15] there was samson
[1:35:19] samson was raised up to destroy the
[1:35:23] enemy
[1:35:26] and we're raised up to cast satan out
[1:35:30] and a rule from the supernatural to tear
[1:35:32] down the gates of hell
[1:35:36] is that right that's what the church is
[1:35:38] to do the gates of hell will not prevail
[1:35:41] against it so
[1:35:42] we must be tearing it down
[1:35:45] amen we're raised up to cast out devils
[1:35:49] that's what salvation is that's what
[1:35:51] healing is
[1:35:52] is casting out devils amen
[1:35:56] we are to rule from the supernatural
[1:35:58] that means we are to rule over the
[1:36:00] supernatural realms
[1:36:01] of satan's kingdom he minds us we now
[1:36:05] mind him no more
[1:36:10] has to do what we say we don't do what
[1:36:11] he says
[1:36:14] amen here
[1:36:17] samson was predestinated
[1:36:22] how many is predestinated predestinated
[1:36:26] ordained by god is his mother
[1:36:30] the church gonna say it that way visited
[1:36:33] by an angel
[1:36:36] telling my i'm going to bring forth an
[1:36:39] offspring
[1:36:40] out of out of here out of the church and
[1:36:43] it's going to have
[1:36:44] it's going to have seven locks it's
[1:36:46] going to be covenanted with god
[1:36:49] he's going to have seven locks
[1:36:51] representing seven church ages
[1:36:58] and and his covenant with god in every
[1:37:02] age
[1:37:04] represents a nazirite
[1:37:07] vow that i surrendered to god
[1:37:10] and i'm dedicated to god consecrated
[1:37:14] that's what a nazarite vow was
[1:37:16] it was to consecrate them and set them
[1:37:18] apart and made them peculiar
[1:37:21] and we as a church must never lose
[1:37:25] our peculiarity we are to be different
[1:37:31] we are to dare to be different see young
[1:37:34] people
[1:37:34] young people say i want to be like them
[1:37:36] no that's not the way it's supposed to
[1:37:38] be you are not to lose your identity
[1:37:42] as a christian amen
[1:37:48] and there you know the the man knew
[1:37:51] the power of god why you know sometimes
[1:37:53] he would be caught up by
[1:37:55] out in the open and no weapon and a
[1:37:58] thousand philistines
[1:38:00] you know would be be surrounded him and
[1:38:03] a new jawbone that's what the bible said
[1:38:08] a new jawbone of a of an ass
[1:38:11] was laying there and he picks that thing
[1:38:13] up
[1:38:14] well a new one you know is a little
[1:38:17] different from a hardened one
[1:38:19] it's still soft and it don't look like
[1:38:23] it would absolutely would go through the
[1:38:25] helmets of those philistines
[1:38:29] it it it looked like it could never
[1:38:32] overcome against the enemy
[1:38:35] and the the innumerable army that was
[1:38:39] around them are you with me
[1:38:40] yeah a thousand of them but that's
[1:38:42] innumerable when you're just one
[1:38:45] are you with me amen it's a big army
[1:38:49] and here you won but yet you just pick
[1:38:53] up a fresh promise
[1:38:58] said i've never tried this one before
[1:39:01] hey
[1:39:01] there's all kinds of promises in this
[1:39:04] world you've never tried before
[1:39:08] amen but in a defeat oh it's the word
[1:39:10] it'll defeat the devil
[1:39:12] anywhere any place anytime
[1:39:15] under any conditions
[1:39:19] so the devil's got him surrounded
[1:39:23] he looks around for something to fight
[1:39:25] with
[1:39:27] there's a jawbone of an ice
[1:39:30] you know sometimes your promise looks
[1:39:34] mighty weak
[1:39:38] you you mean this promise if i believe
[1:39:41] this
[1:39:42] it's really going to defeat this big old
[1:39:44] devil that's really coming
[1:39:46] against me
[1:39:49] well no it won't lay in there on the
[1:39:52] dirt
[1:39:55] it won't defeat nothing laying here in
[1:39:57] the scripture
[1:40:00] it's not dirt but see my analogy laying
[1:40:03] here
[1:40:03] covered up in all the other promises
[1:40:07] it'll not defeat an enemy lay it over
[1:40:08] there on somebody's sick it'll not
[1:40:10] defeat him
[1:40:12] but if you will take that promise
[1:40:15] into a hand of faith
[1:40:18] and realize you have been called and
[1:40:20] ordained
[1:40:22] to cascade out as the bride of jesus
[1:40:26] christ is somebody with me
[1:40:28] and you begin to smite that enemy oh
[1:40:31] brother
[1:40:31] demons are going to start falling
[1:40:34] everywhere
[1:40:36] and all samson had to do was feel right
[1:40:39] back here and he said but i've got a
[1:40:41] covenant with god
[1:40:43] amen amen
[1:40:46] thy seed shall possess the gates of
[1:40:48] thine enemy
[1:40:50] and as long as he can reach back there
[1:40:52] and feel those seven locks
[1:40:54] that was representative of god's
[1:40:56] covenant
[1:40:57] there was nothing going to bother him as
[1:40:59] long as he
[1:41:00] remembered that covenant promise
[1:41:04] and nothing can bother the church of the
[1:41:06] living god
[1:41:07] as long as we can feel the holy ghost
[1:41:10] the covenant of god's word and our heart
[1:41:13] and the pentecostal blessing
[1:41:17] by the way that was taken from a 63
[1:41:19] quote
[1:41:21] amen fill that holy ghost the covenant
[1:41:23] of god's word in our heart
[1:41:25] the pentecostal blessing
[1:41:28] most message folks today don't know what
[1:41:30] a pentecostal blessing is
[1:41:33] amen but these these that are being
[1:41:36] scorned as these peculiar ones
[1:41:38] they still got seven locks they hadn't
[1:41:42] went beyond the prophet's message
[1:41:44] to an eighth age come on
[1:41:48] but they're there with the fullness of
[1:41:50] the word from paul's gospel
[1:41:52] to paul's gospel again in the last
[1:41:55] church age
[1:41:56] are you with me amen from alpha to omega
[1:42:00] and they feel right back here and say
[1:42:02] yeah he's the same yesterday today and
[1:42:04] forever
[1:42:05] and this promise is just as good today
[1:42:07] as it ever was
[1:42:10] pick it up in your hands and use it
[1:42:12] against your enemy
[1:42:18] the works that i do so you do also
[1:42:21] the life that i have in me will be in
[1:42:23] you
[1:42:25] as the father has sent me so send i you
[1:42:28] how did the father send him this father
[1:42:30] that sent him within him
[1:42:33] somebody with me amen jesus sins of man
[1:42:36] goes in the man it isn't the man it's
[1:42:38] jesus
[1:42:40] amen it wasn't it wasn't him it wasn't
[1:42:43] samson
[1:42:43] brother branham would describe him as a
[1:42:45] puny little runt
[1:42:47] amen a like boy
[1:42:52] amen but he had it he had a hidden power
[1:42:54] on the inside of him
[1:42:56] and when the spirit of the lord would
[1:42:58] come upon him huh
[1:43:00] there wasn't a job too big there wasn't
[1:43:01] an army too big there wasn't gates too
[1:43:04] big
[1:43:04] there was nothing too big for samson
[1:43:15] that early church cast out devils
[1:43:19] raised the dead healed the sick
[1:43:22] they wouldn't even get in the shadow of
[1:43:23] peter just let the shadow pass over them
[1:43:26] that's all it took
[1:43:31] amen
[1:43:36] delilah
[1:43:41] samson had a fatal attraction
[1:43:48] he had a fatal attraction to harlots
[1:43:54] so has the church had a fatal attraction
[1:43:59] to harlots and they've joined themselves
[1:44:02] with
[1:44:04] roman catholic and methodist and baptist
[1:44:06] and pentecostal
[1:44:10] and message denominations
[1:44:17] because he had an attraction to harlots
[1:44:21] who is this delilah
[1:44:24] who shaved the power delilah isn't a
[1:44:28] person
[1:44:30] not today delilah is a spirit
[1:44:34] and spirits never die
[1:44:38] amen it's in that communicable spirit
[1:44:41] we're all one and everybody and
[1:44:43] everything is acceptable it's people's
[1:44:46] rights just lay down and go to sleep
[1:44:49] just sleep on my lap then the next day
[1:44:52] you know
[1:44:53] a cancel culture you know also known as
[1:44:55] group shaming
[1:44:58] where you're shamed by the world
[1:45:01] for not letting gays have their
[1:45:03] sweethearts
[1:45:10] that they don't have a heart attack they
[1:45:13] don't care what i say out there
[1:45:19] daniel listen anyway i said brother tim
[1:45:22] you got hate in your heart no i got love
[1:45:24] i got the greatest love for gay people
[1:45:28] much love for gays as i do for harlots
[1:45:33] and and prostitutes we
[1:45:36] love them and we want them cease
[1:45:39] them saved and delivered
[1:45:47] we want to see them filled with the holy
[1:45:49] ghost and make heaven their home
[1:45:51] we don't want anybody lost
[1:45:58] amen
[1:46:02] the worldly group changed you for not
[1:46:04] accepting sin
[1:46:08] you know for not accepting
[1:46:12] can i go down this line just a minute
[1:46:14] the black lighter
[1:46:16] the black lives matters in their lgbt
[1:46:18] movement
[1:46:20] and their objection to the nuclear
[1:46:22] family a mother
[1:46:23] and a dad in a family
[1:46:27] a worldly group changed me for not
[1:46:29] accepting that
[1:46:31] for not accepting the exploiting of our
[1:46:34] women
[1:46:35] and pushing them out into careers when
[1:46:38] they were made by god to nurture
[1:46:39] children
[1:46:42] can i quote you the bible to be keepers
[1:46:45] at home
[1:46:48] amen we don't want that we don't want
[1:46:50] that red today brother tim that's
[1:46:52] not one even in message churches we
[1:46:54] don't want that
[1:46:55] said today listen before you
[1:46:58] misunderstand me i have nothing against
[1:47:00] a young girl going to get my education
[1:47:02] and
[1:47:03] getting a you know getting something
[1:47:05] that could help her family in
[1:47:07] future times but her goal should be to
[1:47:10] get married
[1:47:12] to have children and nurture them to
[1:47:14] raise them for god
[1:47:17] and not be swept away in this
[1:47:21] idolatry of women worship today
[1:47:28] i hope you understand that we're not
[1:47:30] criticizing somebody that's unmarried
[1:47:32] because they got a
[1:47:33] they got education went and got them a
[1:47:35] job god bless you
[1:47:36] and man you know when you get when you
[1:47:39] do get married
[1:47:40] you can be a homemaker and raise your
[1:47:42] children the time comes and the children
[1:47:45] are gone you help your husband or do
[1:47:47] whatever
[1:47:47] you know there can be be things that you
[1:47:49] can use we're not condemning that
[1:47:54] but we are condemning this feminist move
[1:47:57] today that pulls the woman
[1:48:01] out of the home and out of position
[1:48:04] where she's no longer subject to your
[1:48:06] husband
[1:48:11] i just saw some eyes roll and say get
[1:48:14] off that soapbox
[1:48:15] maybe i ought to get on it a little more
[1:48:18] rub a little more
[1:48:19] soap in a man
[1:48:22] delilah and you lay down in her lap
[1:48:27] and the first thing you know your power
[1:48:29] is cut off
[1:48:36] again we're not condemning someone
[1:48:37] that's got to help their husband and
[1:48:40] situation some
[1:48:41] summer merit that but i'm talking about
[1:48:46] i'm just talking about the general goal
[1:48:52] the church's chipped her cup
[1:48:55] of her fornications that that
[1:48:58] worldliness of
[1:49:00] the council culture their communicable
[1:49:02] we're all
[1:49:03] one the people's rights we're all to be
[1:49:06] alike and the same and you know you you
[1:49:09] can't be different and
[1:49:10] they've drank out of it that's right
[1:49:14] they they deface memorials
[1:49:20] because really the memorial that they're
[1:49:22] really trying to
[1:49:23] face deface we see it in america where
[1:49:27] they want to
[1:49:28] wipe away and deface and get rid of
[1:49:32] the men who wrote the constitution
[1:49:35] and stood for the godliness as they knew
[1:49:38] it and
[1:49:39] made this a christian nation and they
[1:49:41] want to they want to deface
[1:49:42] the monuments that's right
[1:49:46] stop right there for a minute how many
[1:49:48] members me
[1:49:50] i can't remember when it was 10 15 could
[1:49:52] have been 20 years ago
[1:49:53] preaching on the defacing of a monument
[1:49:56] anybody remember that
[1:49:58] brother daryl you do okay there's one
[1:50:00] you got a good memory god bless you
[1:50:02] where's the rest of you
[1:50:04] karen do you remember that i meant she's
[1:50:06] had a brain bleed what's your problem
[1:50:14] the facing of a monument
[1:50:19] and what they want to do is deface
[1:50:24] the original writers of the bible
[1:50:27] and say the days of miracles are past
[1:50:31] and turn us into a bloodless religion
[1:50:34] where the power of god don't work in the
[1:50:36] people
[1:50:39] it's all happening right here we see it
[1:50:41] on what front is happening right in the
[1:50:43] other front
[1:50:47] and i'm protesting
[1:50:50] i'm saying it's wrong amen i'm saying
[1:50:54] the word of god is true
[1:50:56] and the book of acts should be our goal
[1:50:59] to write another book of acts in this
[1:51:01] day come on
[1:51:02] amen to put forth another branch
[1:51:08] brother branham said it tripped a cup of
[1:51:11] her fornication to the mouth
[1:51:13] of god's church that's been raised up to
[1:51:15] show his last signs and wonders as jesus
[1:51:18] last commandment was to do in mark 16
[1:51:22] and has left them stripped
[1:51:27] standing strip denying the power thereof
[1:51:29] denying the holy spirit denying the
[1:51:31] power to speak with tongues
[1:51:33] denying the power of the holy spirit to
[1:51:35] raise the dead and heal the sick and
[1:51:36] cast out devils
[1:51:40] and he said now the church is weak
[1:51:44] and the philistines are on you now
[1:51:46] sampson
[1:51:52] stripped him of the power trying to find
[1:51:55] out what strength he had where did your
[1:51:57] strength lie
[1:51:58] it lay in the word not
[1:52:02] not theology the word a person
[1:52:05] your covenant with him your experience
[1:52:07] with him
[1:52:09] and and they say and and they shaved off
[1:52:12] the locks
[1:52:15] by saying it don't mean that and the
[1:52:18] days of miracles have passed and
[1:52:20] and there's no such thing as as this or
[1:52:22] that you know
[1:52:23] we actually get the holy ghost different
[1:52:25] than they did in the book of acts
[1:52:30] but you know again i just want to ask
[1:52:33] today
[1:52:35] who is the crop of new hair
[1:52:42] you see the end of samson was not just
[1:52:45] being blinded
[1:52:47] and grinding at the devil's wheel round
[1:52:50] and around and around
[1:52:52] and let me just tell you my friend you
[1:52:55] go around and you play with the devil
[1:52:57] man or woman
[1:52:58] i tell you what he'll do he'll blind
[1:53:00] your eyes
[1:53:02] and he'll put you around at the devil's
[1:53:04] will and you'll just go around
[1:53:06] and around serving the devil that you
[1:53:08] were raised up to destroy
[1:53:16] but who is that crop i'm seeing
[1:53:20] something different than a blind church
[1:53:25] i'm seeing something different than a
[1:53:27] weak church
[1:53:29] that's in prison come on a man that's
[1:53:32] grinding at the devil's will
[1:53:35] using one little street he has to work
[1:53:37] for the devil
[1:53:38] i'm seeing something different i'm
[1:53:40] seeing a new crop
[1:53:43] of hair i'm seeing faith begin to rise
[1:53:46] i mean i'm seeing the power of god
[1:53:48] coming back in the church
[1:53:50] i'm seeing a level of expectancy begin
[1:53:53] to happen
[1:53:54] amen i'm seeing an atmosphere
[1:53:57] that says oh my the devil hadn't noticed
[1:54:02] but we're here we have arrived amen the
[1:54:08] people who are now
[1:54:09] back in covenant with god again who
[1:54:12] believe that word of god
[1:54:15] just take me to those two posts
[1:54:19] because satan's kingdom's about to come
[1:54:21] down
[1:54:22] because we're leaving out of here amen
[1:54:25] in the most
[1:54:26] glorious shout
[1:54:27] [Applause]
[1:54:29] amen with a greater victory than ever
[1:54:31] the church ever had
[1:54:33] in all the ages
[1:54:39] brother branham said samson began to
[1:54:42] think
[1:54:44] wonder if there's a possibility
[1:54:48] i know my hair has grown out
[1:54:52] but i'm blind there could be a
[1:54:54] possibility of another revival
[1:54:57] and he says there is a possibility
[1:55:05] amen and he shows it there of this
[1:55:08] little boy
[1:55:09] that he had to lead him up to the two
[1:55:11] post
[1:55:13] just put my hands on this post let me
[1:55:15] let me lean on this post
[1:55:19] and there is he's leading on the post
[1:55:22] you know
[1:55:23] he began to think god is still god
[1:55:27] the church may have failed him and went
[1:55:29] into the dark ages
[1:55:31] and we might have got down here the end
[1:55:33] time and people made two lords out of
[1:55:35] him
[1:55:35] and they made a perugia and then they
[1:55:37] made a
[1:55:39] seven thunder cults and they made this
[1:55:41] and that
[1:55:42] come on but god is still god
[1:55:46] one went over in formalism the other
[1:55:48] went over to emotionalism
[1:55:49] but god's still god amen
[1:55:52] i put him to the trust i know he remains
[1:55:55] god
[1:55:57] it's me that's been wrong
[1:56:01] i wonder if we could if we could be like
[1:56:04] samson where
[1:56:05] they didn't notice the tears was coming
[1:56:07] down his face
[1:56:09] they even noticed and pray in a prayer
[1:56:12] like brother branham prayed for himself
[1:56:14] god created me a revival
[1:56:19] i wonder if there could be a people
[1:56:21] today that could pray that prayer like
[1:56:23] brother branham did and recognize in
[1:56:24] your day and his message
[1:56:26] god created me a revival
[1:56:29] let me be the revival
[1:56:32] let each of us be the revival the
[1:56:34] revival in me
[1:56:37] lord make me to hunger how many can say
[1:56:40] lord make me to
[1:56:42] hunger again i see you young boys there
[1:56:45] playing with your video games i wonder
[1:56:48] how many tapes have you listened to
[1:56:50] amen god put a hunger in our young man
[1:56:54] then video games is the worst a waste of
[1:56:57] your time get in the message
[1:56:59] get in the word hear what god said in
[1:57:01] this day
[1:57:04] when long ago we had a youth camp and
[1:57:06] the holy spirit moved and
[1:57:07] demons were cast out everywhere we had
[1:57:10] 10 manifestations of demonic powers
[1:57:13] and god brought deliverance in young men
[1:57:16] and here in the next thing you know
[1:57:17] piles of game boys and man and videos
[1:57:21] and
[1:57:22] video games all this was piled up
[1:57:25] worth thousands of dollars and we had a
[1:57:28] burning
[1:57:31] hallelujah don't let it come back
[1:57:34] [Applause]
[1:57:36] don't flirt with it realize we're in the
[1:57:40] last time
[1:57:42] realize we got a message we're
[1:57:44] responsible for
[1:57:45] realize
[1:57:48] there's something better to do with your
[1:57:50] time
[1:57:56] i'll bring rotten eggs next service by
[1:57:58] the town well
[1:57:59] i'll have timothy preach
[1:58:06] he can dodge better than i can
[1:58:16] drew you heard him sing
[1:58:20] said to me last week papa how come you

[1:58:32] so i pulled him and william in there
[1:58:34] i've got this little thing
[1:58:36] full of pins that's stuck in my toes and
[1:58:39] stuck in my feet and stuck in my heel
[1:58:41] and stuck this way in six surgeries that
[1:58:43] it took
[1:58:45] when the doctor said son
[1:58:48] you'd be better off with a without a
[1:58:50] foot than that foot
[1:58:52] we're going to work on it but you only
[1:58:53] have 50 chance of keeping it
[1:58:58] i laid in the hospital nine days i split
[1:59:00] the cast open
[1:59:03] the doctor said his heart was going like
[1:59:05] this
[1:59:08] i come out of that hospital
[1:59:12] graduated from there into a walking cast
[1:59:16] i would go up into arkansas some of the
[1:59:18] arkansas boys remember me
[1:59:21] wayne lawson said i was four or five
[1:59:23] years old and said
[1:59:24] all i remember about you brother tim you
[1:59:25] had this something on your foot i said
[1:59:27] it was a walking cast
[1:59:29] and i preached with this walking cast we
[1:59:32] had a revival
[1:59:35] blue devil you ain't gonna keep us down
[1:59:39] no matter what happens
[1:59:42] pull that cast off of there six weeks
[1:59:45] later or eight weeks later
[1:59:47] there in front of that doctor that
[1:59:50] doctor
[1:59:50] threw his hands up in the air and tears
[1:59:52] rolled out of his
[1:59:54] out of his face and he said son don't
[1:59:56] you ever thank me for this
[1:59:59] god brought you through this nothing
[2:00:01] else but god
[2:00:02] [Music]
[2:00:07] and i've used these feet to preach all
[2:00:09] over the world
[2:00:13] because the devil can't keep us down he
[2:00:15] can't stop us
[2:00:17] [Applause]
[2:00:20] drew saw me the other day at the at the
[2:00:23] camp
[2:00:24] he looked at my feet and he said papa
[2:00:26] can i look at them toes again i said yep
[2:00:30] he pulled my shoes off and then he
[2:00:32] pulled my socks off
[2:00:34] they pulled some of my toes and pulled
[2:00:37] and played with them
[2:00:38] some of them that don't have bones in
[2:00:39] them
[2:00:41] and he said
[2:00:46] papa do veterinarians
[2:00:50] do they take the bones out of penguins
[2:00:52] feet so they walk that way
[2:01:09] but where should we be in this day and
[2:01:11] hour
[2:01:12] in this time where we've seen what god
[2:01:14] has brought us through and what he's
[2:01:15] done
[2:01:19] created me lord what's needed in me
[2:01:24] sometimes you know god has allowed
[2:01:26] things to be a harness
[2:01:28] to keep you in the mode that he wants
[2:01:30] you in
[2:01:32] make me be a more consecrated servant
[2:01:36] a better servant more blessed of you
[2:01:38] more able more humbler
[2:01:41] more kinder more willing to work
[2:01:44] more looking to the things that are
[2:01:46] possible forgetting the things that are
[2:01:48] in the past
[2:01:49] and the negatives let me press to the
[2:01:51] mark of the high calling in christ
[2:01:59] now simpson knew what was going to
[2:02:00] happen he knew
[2:02:03] what it was going to cost him he knew it
[2:02:06] would cost him his life
[2:02:10] but who wants to live in a depraved
[2:02:14] sorry godless condition
[2:02:20] are you with me samson began to cry out
[2:02:23] he knew what it began was going to cost
[2:02:25] him it would cost him his life
[2:02:27] he knew that he would die yes and we
[2:02:31] ought to know too
[2:02:32] we'll have to die to some of our creeds
[2:02:36] our own ideas and our own ways and our
[2:02:39] own ambitions
[2:02:41] and our own sinful past come on in our
[2:02:45] and there's gonna have to be a real
[2:02:48] crucifixion
[2:02:49] of the old man in order to have this
[2:02:52] revival
[2:02:54] but i wonder if we're willing to pay the
[2:02:58] price
[2:03:01] i wonder if there's a people that even
[2:03:03] like tabernacle
[2:03:09] that are willing to pay the price of a
[2:03:12] renewed walk with god
[2:03:14] of a more dedicated and more consecrated
[2:03:17] more surrendered life
[2:03:20] i wonder if there's a people that's
[2:03:22] willing to sell out
[2:03:27] and brother brad was saying oh god if
[2:03:29] the body of jesus christ could stand as
[2:03:31] one and
[2:03:32] every fiber and every member begin to
[2:03:34] vibrate
[2:03:36] with the literal baptism of the holy
[2:03:38] ghost
[2:03:39] again not with new members and shaking
[2:03:42] hands or some creeds
[2:03:44] but with the power of god and that was
[2:03:46] sensing he began there
[2:03:48] and he began to vibrate as he laid hands
[2:03:52] there
[2:03:53] upon those two pillars and something
[2:03:55] began to surge through him
[2:03:58] and he began to press
[2:04:01] maybe he didn't move much at first but
[2:04:03] he pressed some more
[2:04:04] maybe it didn't move very much at that
[2:04:06] time but he pressed some more
[2:04:08] and he he said oh god just once more
[2:04:12] whatever you have to do lord let it
[2:04:15] vibrate through me let it empower me
[2:04:17] let it set me free let me be on fire for
[2:04:20] god let me shake off this lukewarmness
[2:04:22] let me get my whole life to you i want
[2:04:25] to be a sold out
[2:04:26] son or daughter of god
[2:04:30] and he began to vibrate
[2:04:33] under the power of god
[2:04:40] and those posts begin to buckle and i
[2:04:43] see them begin to buckle
[2:04:46] cancer's healed brain bleeds healed
[2:04:49] and sinners weeping their way to calvary
[2:04:52] i see satan's kingdom coming down
[2:04:56] and i see a triumphant bride that's
[2:04:58] going to leave out of here
[2:05:02] crucified to the flesh death their own
[2:05:04] ideals
[2:05:05] love with jesus and him having the
[2:05:07] preeminence somebody
[2:05:09] that loves them with all their heart
[2:05:11] with all their soul with everything
[2:05:13] that's within them
[2:05:20] stripped stripped
[2:05:23] but raised up to show signs and wonders
[2:05:27] most of them stripped us speaking in
[2:05:30] tongues
[2:05:32] a divine healing stripped to the
[2:05:34] atmosphere of the holy ghost
[2:05:37] sometimes not even an amen the other on
[2:05:40] the other hand just a bunch of
[2:05:41] fanaticism jumping up and down
[2:05:44] idolatry in idol worship
[2:05:52] yet we cry for revival how many wants
[2:05:55] revival
[2:05:56] how many would say i want revival in my
[2:05:58] soul
[2:06:00] would that be your prayer this morning i
[2:06:02] want it
[2:06:04] yeah we we cry for revival but when he
[2:06:06] comes
[2:06:08] we treat him like they did then and let
[2:06:11] him sit with
[2:06:12] unwashed feet somebody raise up in the
[2:06:16] spirit of god and holler a man or scream
[2:06:19] or something like that when jesus
[2:06:20] happens to pass by they put him out of
[2:06:22] the church
[2:06:24] they think it's awful ashamed to
[2:06:26] disgrace the church to people when it's
[2:06:28] jesus
[2:06:29] himself passing by
[2:06:33] amen oh my you know when you get a blind
[2:06:36] bartimaeus
[2:06:38] somebody that realizes their need
[2:06:41] and they hear that jesus is passing by
[2:06:44] you can't keep them quiet they began to
[2:06:47] say
[2:06:48] oh god have mercy on me don't pass me by
[2:06:52] i've got to have you i can't i can't let
[2:06:55] you go
[2:06:56] you'll be like that woman get a hold of
[2:06:58] his
[2:06:59] of his garment i want him
[2:07:05] but they'd rather leave him with a dirty
[2:07:07] name
[2:07:10] saying something against it days of
[2:07:12] miracles has passed
[2:07:15] there's no such thing as that it's just
[2:07:16] emotion
[2:07:18] when the bible said he's the same
[2:07:20] yesterday
[2:07:21] today and forever instead of watching
[2:07:25] him
[2:07:26] with tears of joy
[2:07:29] so glad that he's here i'm going to just
[2:07:32] tell you church
[2:07:37] i said it today we don't realize
[2:07:41] what a miracle we have
[2:07:44] but i'm gonna bring it down to you you
[2:07:45] don't realize what a miracle you have
[2:07:49] to have anointed preaching
[2:07:52] to have anointed singing to have
[2:07:54] anointing in the pews
[2:07:56] to have the holy spirit moving to have
[2:07:59] divine healing among us
[2:08:01] to see people filled with the holy ghost
[2:08:04] you don't realize what a miracle that is
[2:08:07] whether we've got a world that is dying
[2:08:10] [Applause]
[2:08:12] and passing out in the laodicea and
[2:08:15] you've got a chance
[2:08:16] at revival for your own life i'll tell
[2:08:20] you if i were you this morning
[2:08:21] i wouldn't let him pass me by i'd be
[2:08:25] crying out jesus have mercy on me have
[2:08:27] mercy upon me
[2:08:29] because i tell you when you recognize
[2:08:30] his presence
[2:08:32] when you really realize that's him among
[2:08:34] us
[2:08:36] amen it makes you hysterically amen
[2:08:39] brother baby said i got hysterical and
[2:08:41] anyone that gets in his presence
[2:08:43] that believes him and has faith in him
[2:08:45] it'll make you hysterically
[2:08:47] on the day of pentecost when he comes in
[2:08:49] the form of the holy ghost they got
[2:08:50] hysterically
[2:08:51] and when you really believe and
[2:08:53] recognize it's your opportunity and your
[2:08:55] pres in your
[2:08:56] in his presence and you're sure of it he
[2:08:59] said
[2:09:00] you'll be like her you'll even get out
[2:09:02] of order
[2:09:10] hallelujah i remember sister atlanta
[2:09:13] getting out of order
[2:09:15] getting out of her pew and making laps
[2:09:17] around that bell of this building she
[2:09:18] got out of order
[2:09:20] amen but if you want to do something you
[2:09:23] know for he lets you do it it may be out
[2:09:24] of order but he'll let you do it anyhow
[2:09:27] [Music]
[2:09:28] you get to worship in him praising him
[2:09:30] come on
[2:09:31] amen and realize and realizing that i'm
[2:09:34] in his presence
[2:09:36] and because i'm in his presence he can
[2:09:38] heal my my sick body
[2:09:40] he can save my sick soul he can deliver
[2:09:42] god's people
[2:09:46] it isn't that god failed the church as
[2:09:47] the church has failed him
[2:09:51] we ought to be standing in a condition
[2:09:55] instead of letting daejeon have the
[2:09:57] victory
[2:09:59] and our enemy's celebrating and calling
[2:10:02] on their god worshiping him
[2:10:04] it ought to be us
[2:10:09] doward victor victorious o jehovah
[2:10:15] you're our victory having you in our
[2:10:18] life is our victory
[2:10:20] you are our joy and we must have you
[2:10:23] we must have you in our life we must
[2:10:25] have you we must be
[2:10:27] the church that's that is the last
[2:10:29] commission
[2:10:30] amen the last thing he said unto the
[2:10:32] church go into all the world and preach
[2:10:34] the gospel
[2:10:35] make disciples of all nations he that
[2:10:38] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[2:10:40] he that believeth not to be damned
[2:10:42] and these signs this ties it together
[2:10:45] these signs shall follow them that
[2:10:46] believe
[2:10:48] how many is the followers of him today
[2:10:52] and the signs will follow let's bow our
[2:10:55] heads together
[2:10:56] let the musicians come
[2:11:00] oh yeah it burned out his
[2:11:03] eyes i wondered today at the church
[2:11:07] what kind of eyesight did this have
[2:11:10] wonder about the message believers
[2:11:12] around the world today
[2:11:14] what kind of eyesight do they have
[2:11:18] can they see he's still the same
[2:11:23] can he see that they see that he's still
[2:11:25] god
[2:11:27] that he's still the same yesterday today
[2:11:29] and forever
[2:11:32] to realize that we were church we were
[2:11:38] church and brother branham was here we
[2:11:40] cast out devils
[2:11:42] we raised the dead we did the things
[2:11:46] jesus did
[2:11:47] sin couldn't dwell among us because the
[2:11:50] holy spirit would call it out
[2:11:54] i wonder today if we could return to
[2:11:58] that kind of a church
[2:12:06] [Music]
[2:12:11] brother branham told us
[2:12:14] in 1965 that instead of tearing for the
[2:12:18] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:12:21] we let science prove to us the holy
[2:12:22] ghost was only for the disciples
[2:12:25] well we got something different today
[2:12:27] yeah it's different all right
[2:12:29] but it's strangely so similar to what
[2:12:31] they got out into nomination
[2:12:33] it's a powerless cult you've turned to
[2:12:37] [Music]
[2:12:39] instead of raising the keeping the
[2:12:41] divine healing going which he ought to
[2:12:43] be
[2:12:46] now
[2:12:48] somebody said well you know you're sure
[2:12:51] it's not just a tradition what
[2:12:52] what we're supposed to be you ought to
[2:12:54] be now
[2:12:56] raising the dead and doing great
[2:12:58] miracles
[2:13:00] you let satan under your leadership of
[2:13:03] religious men take the word of god and
[2:13:05] say it was for another age
[2:13:11] i hear our prophet saying there ought to
[2:13:12] be a holy power surrounding
[2:13:14] in the church that make demons flee
[2:13:17] instead of that has become a
[2:13:18] laughingstock
[2:13:21] he said why is it it's all mechanics
[2:13:24] and no dynamics
[2:13:25] [Music]
[2:13:28] why he said the church ought to be the
[2:13:30] most
[2:13:31] in its most glorious stage right now
[2:13:34] the power of his resurrection great
[2:13:36] signs and wonders
[2:13:38] [Music]
[2:13:41] i wonder if you look in your life today
[2:13:44] and you say
[2:13:45] i'm lacking that real dedication and
[2:13:47] consecration
[2:13:49] why don't you come back to him now
[2:13:53] [Music]
[2:13:56] what's it going to require you that's
[2:13:57] going to require for you to die
[2:13:59] [Music]
[2:14:01] it's going to require you make a full
[2:14:03] surrender
[2:14:06] it's going to require that you become
[2:14:08] sold out and dedicated and consecrated
[2:14:14] [Music]
[2:14:24] even brother branham would say they say
[2:14:27] they have nerve to say wonder what
[2:14:29] happened to the god of the bible
[2:14:32] where is that god he said why you choked
[2:14:35] him out by your
[2:14:37] creeds and your traditions
[2:14:40] he said he's still the same god of
[2:14:42] history
[2:14:44] he's waiting for his people to call him
[2:14:45] up out of history
[2:14:47] but that god remains god
[2:14:51] he's god forever but our traditions
[2:14:54] we've taught it away from the people
[2:14:58] i wonder if that's our condition today
[2:15:01] around the world
[2:15:03] isn't it time to come back to god any
[2:15:08] time to make a full surrender
[2:15:10] [Music]
[2:15:14] in the time to say god i really need you
[2:15:17] i really want to sell out i want to
[2:15:19] really consecrate
[2:15:23] i want to be that dedicated son or
[2:15:25] daughter
[2:15:25] [Music]
[2:15:29] can you surrender up some of your pride
[2:15:33] some of the starchiness get it out of
[2:15:35] your collar enough just to really
[2:15:37] worship god
[2:15:39] could there really be some real tears
[2:15:42] that comes down and
[2:15:44] that you wash his feet and you just make
[2:15:47] him welcome
[2:15:49] and you say lord here i am remember me
[2:15:56] remember me would there be somebody here
[2:15:59] today

[2:16:14] say lord that's me
[2:16:16] that's me i want it lord i want it with
