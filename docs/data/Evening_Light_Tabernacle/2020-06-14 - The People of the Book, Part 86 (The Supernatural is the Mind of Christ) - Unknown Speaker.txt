[Music] hey man how many glad to be here this morning let's all stand together it just i just feel like something good is about to happen i just feel like something good is on the way [Applause] god has promised to be to open all of heaven and brother this could be that very day when god's people humble themselves and call on jesus and they look to him [Music] i just feel like something good is about to happen i just feel like something good is on the way god is and brother this could be that very day when god's people hunt for themselves and call on jesus and they look to him [Music] i have learned whatever happens we should praise him [Applause] for i know he's working all thanks for our good every tier i shed is worth all the for investments know he'll see me through he said he would all he promised we can hardly fathom all the things he has in store for those who pray and i just feel like something good is about to happen and brother this could be that very day i just feel like something good is about to happen i just feel like something good is on the way god has promised he'd open all of heaven and brother this could be that very day when god's people humble themselves i

yes i feel like is [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] is the lord has been so good [Music] [Applause] is [Music] lord has [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] amen the lord been good to you amen are you happy this morning happy to be in the house of the lord and it's always a privilege to come to the house of the lord and to gather together with friends and family of like precious faith amen it's what it's all about to worship our god and our savior and our creator and i don't think we should ever let our focus get off of that what church is really about is about him you know church is not really about our comfort or what we want or how we want it to be or how we think it should be church is about him amen and i believe that ought to be our attitudes and you know in saying that i just want to just say once again and remind you that we are under restrictions in our in our assembly and uh we're under restrictions as far as government's concerned there's you know i know a lot of things are going on this world and we got a lot of opinions about that but no matter what our opinions are you know there's things that we still have to abide by and have to have to follow and guidelines we have to follow and in doing so we have to have the deacon set you in certain places and it may not be your favorite place but i'm happy to be here i'll be honest with you sitting up here is not my favorite place to sit i'd rather sit out there somewhere and get comfortable hide behind somebody whatever you know i mean i it's not my personality to want to sit up here on the platform i'm sure not brother aaron's or brother joe's or have the cameras on you every move you make and what you do what you're not doing how you're looking how you're not looking it's not a fun place to be i'll trade places with you amen but i know i know not all but some have voiced it that they're not happy with the way things are going but i'm sorry we cannot do anything about that and so if you'd quit giving our deacons a hard time they don't like their job either and how they have to operate and how they're having to do and if we can just just settle in and realize what church is really about it's not about our comfort it's not about our comfort zone it's about him and where he what he what he means to me and if god really means something to you you could care less what seat you sit in you can care less who you're sitting by what seat you're sitting in if it's cold if it's hot if it's this that any other it's our focus gets off is when we start caring about these other things let's get our focus on god amen don't give our deacons a hard time their heart jobs hard enough amen and just pull together and saying that i said that because this coveted worthy whatever your opinion is is a real thing and there's actually a church right now and brother reeks church there a little small assembly smaller quite smaller than ours that are facing it right now the brother brother eric and his wife both are sick with it there's others in their church that are sick with it and he said you know i thought i was trying to do whatever i could do and he said maybe i didn't do enough you know and they're facing this right now and we don't want to get there you know we don't want that to happen it may happen but we want to do everything we can to keep it from happening and so don't forget if you're dismissed go completely to your cars head to the house god bless you amen and well you can if you want to have a family get together whatever at your house that's up to you but we have to abide by things here at the church they're actually opening up another floor there in minden for covid because there's been an uptick in it so you know we just want to be mindful of these we we we trust the lord but we also got to do what we got to do and so let's do that with all of our heart and and keep our focus on what's really important when we walk through those doors it's not our seat it's not who we're sitting by it's not none of that it's all about him and i believe if we got that focus correct then everything else something good's about to happen amen but you know when that little thing's there and it causes a little nervousness or a little upset spirits those things are real too and they affect they affect people around you they're we want to push all that stuff out and say when i come to the house of the lord i'm coming for one reason that's to worship god and get our focus on that and let everything else go i mean whatever's going on in the world whatever is going on around us just let it go but stay focused on what's really important amen god bless you we stand together again didn't know if you want to be standing while i spoke about those things but you know i think we ought to be sincere and serious about it and then just understand that this is beyond our control it you know if something happens we get an outbreak of it government steps in we don't want none of that so we want to do everything we can do and that's why we're doing what we're doing so god bless you today but let's do remember the reeks in their in your prayer brother eric and his wife also i think several others in their church there's only a church of around 50 60 people but they've got quite a few quite a few that's got this and having some issues with it and so we don't remember them in prayer also we have brother dan pruitt that fell from a ladder and hurt himself and so we want to remember him as he recovers from that and continue to remember of course brother ron spencer in your prayers and just hold him up before the lord we need to just keep him there before the throne of god and just asking god to move brother vernon winters as well and the shut-ins also have brother kenny camp that had surgery on friday and i don't know i hadn't heard how all that went but i trust it went well but we want to pray for his recovery how many would have a need you'll make known to the lord and just make it known to him let's just sing that touching jesus is all that really matters maybe you always want to just settle yourself down before the lord maybe something's happened today and you've you know had a little whatever just touching jesus is all that matters getting in his presence is all that matters being in his presence is all that matters if we can just settle ourselves and say god whatever i get today i want to be in your presence i want to be conscious that you're walking near me and you're you're moving in our midst and i'm in your presence how many can say that today lord make me aware make me really aware of what's truly going on the world's got all kinds of stuff happening right now and things on every side but what's really important is god is walking among the people angels are gathering themselves around god is moving god is healing god is delivering in just any moment we're going to take that body change into another dimension that's more important than anything this world could ever have so let's just sing this as we prepare our hearts and minds for this service today oh touching jesus oh jesus in your life will

so many that's what we are okay man we'll let you be seated we have baby dedication this morning so we're gonna ask them to come at this time hey man just come up here to the front bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to jesus amen praise the lord amen praise the lord come right on down here amen we've been just singing the song as you settle him down just a minute um been saying the song ain't got good to give us so many blessings and here uh lindsay and caleb bolton have come to bring their little son caleb jr to be dedicated to the lord and i see grandmother and granddaddy back there and uncle and grand great grandmother and great granddaddy and and relatives and family all over the all over the building so amen let's see if he'll let me have him here just for a moment okay why he's as bright-eyed as he can be looky there this little one that the lord gave us amen what a blessing that he is um we are so glad for these blessings and their treasure that the lord gives us and we need those uh blessings in our lives and we need god to be with us in life's journey and we can't make it alone we got to have his help amen i'm i'm thankful that you know i was able to raise my children in a good church with family and and a whole community of believers to help me raise my children to serve the lord and i think that's a good policy to do is to find a church home and and mother to lead the child the children you know mother is the fifth gospel you know that there's matthew mark luke and john and mother well mother is um she takes them about the first five or six seven eight years or more and and trains them and teaches them and you know the one of the greatest things that we can do in life is to teach them about the lord and to come to know jesus and so that they'll come to know him and christ be the lord of their lives and you know it starts with us it starts with parents and moms and dads and grandparents and all the supporting ones to surrender their lives to god and be dedicated to serve god and then and then we can have children that are raised in the admonition of the lord and that's so important so let's take this little one to the lord that his parents have brought today as they did in the days of jesus they brought little ones to be blessed and i'm not jesus but i'm one of his servants today and we just take this child into our hand little caleb father precious little child that we hold in our hands lord a bible name then lord no doubt as they thought of names and of course naming after daddy and then somebody had named daddy after some figure somewhere but it all comes back to the bible where that there was a great man of faith a man who stayed true in his generation and served you and lord we no names have meanings and we named them after characters that were characters of righteousness and truth and this has been name is now passed down to this little child from daddy on town and lord i just pray god that he'll be reflective of the real caleb in the bible one that knows you lord and serves you and and brings back evidence that the land is true that the resurrection is right and that the holy spirit does reign and live in lives and hearts i pray lord for this child and for its mom and dad that the lord as we dedicate the child and them to you we just ask lord you'll bless them and bless their home and may you be the center of their home so that they can properly lead this child in paths of righteousness i pray god that as they go about their lives that they'll look into the instruction manual of the bible and see how to guide their lives so they can guide this child in paths of righteousness for your name's sake now father i bless this child in your name i ask you bless him with health may the angel of god be with him and over his little life lord and now and in the years to come for we bless him in your name in jesus name amen amen congratulations there amen thank you god bless you both

be found an unexpected soul may drive me from thy oh [Music] make the sun [Music] sometimes i soar [Music] [Applause] an unexpected storm it may bring me low but it'll never [Music] break this morning [Music] amen you can't find that key to let go and let god have this wonderful way what what key is that [Music] as we come to the service this morning i want us to realize the hour that we're living in [Music] we're living in very perilous times today atlanta is on fire seattle is you know has some anarchists there sectioning off parts of the cities there's trouble everywhere that we look in the world in our nation everywhere we also know that brother branham told us that he saw in the vision the binding of the serpent and he was told you're going to have to have a greater sincerity to do this but we're living in the day where we're going to have to we're going to have to have the power we cannot be a weak and powerless generation but a people who knows their god who does exploits but you know it all sincerity begins with you with your life with you as a person with you as an individual for you putting god in the right place [Music] making him first in your life because nothing else will will work i just looked here a moment ago and standing here was a father of a young lady a young lady and her groom to be next weekend we'll be having the wedding but a bride the groom cannot be in disagreement they must be in love they must be in harmony and this is the way it must be with christ and his bride they must be of the same mind and of the same purpose have the same attitude toward the promise and i want you as you worship the lord this morning just to turn your thoughts now to this and i want you to say i just want to let go of everything else around me all the other troubles and problems let the holy spirit deal with my life today in a very personal way [Music] amen we have here people that are here for the first time since this has happened and um we have a wonderful couple right over here brother and sister hollis that have blessed me by being here this morning look to see jonathan susan here able to come today it's been on their heart while i want to be in service i know it's your desire too but now we're here let's put everything we have into it let's not take it for granted we never know when this will be our last service so let go and let god have his wonderful way let go and let god have his way your sorrow will ban this your night turn today let go and let god have his way one more time to sing it tonight let go and let god have his wonderful way let go and let [Music] [Applause] [Music] god [Music] is [Music] father today as we bow before your throne of grace we just want to say that we love you with all our hearts and we're glad to be your children we're glad lord that we can come into your presence and know that you would never leave us or forsake us but you be with us even in us to the end of the world we're asking for your anointing today upon our lives we're your children we are the sheep of your pasture lord we're just asking that you'll minister to us today just one word from you will mean more than what anybody could say to be anointed and then to have anointed ears and hearts for it to fall upon i pray god that we'll open our hearts to you and let you speak to us let the word be real to our hearts lord let it do something in our lives let it change us may we not walk out of here the same but different as we know it's really impossible to be the same we're going to be worse or better lord we know god right here in our service today there are those whose hearts needs to be touched and only you can do it lord anything that we could say would just follow mute ears but if you deal with the heart lord if you would knock upon the door if you would speak to the soul lord did we we know there'd be a chance of it opening up i pray lord that you'll open it up for them and not only them but for our loved ones everywhere lord there's moms and dads and brothers and sisters and grandparents that are crying out today god save my loved ones oh god just hearing from the little japan japanese group lord the struggles that they're having and lord the desires that's in their heart and they're even saying lord would you just wait a little longer there's got to be more japanese to reach lord we don't know how much longer and i can't ask you to wait any longer no more than i could ask this couple to put off their wedding for another day but lord neither can i ask you to put off your coming another day i know lord that your heart is moved wanting lord to receive your bride your people i pray that our hearts should be moved toward you today and we've moved towards you in a great great way with great strives leaving the world leaving sin leaving unbelief behind lord i pray god you'll break through every barrier let the holy spirit re ring supreme we ask in jesus name amen amen just let go and let let god and let god have his way [Music] your songs [Music] we'll turn to philippians chapter 2 and verse 5 as we discover more about the scripture today and look into the word of god we're going to be speaking on today the supernatural is the mind of christ amen philippians 2 and 5 let this mind be in you which also was or was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross god bless you you can have your seats as i said this morning we're going to be speaking on the is the mind of christ and we have been speaking along the lines of faith and believing god and trust in him because we know that we are a people in this age and this time that is required to have a perfect faith that faith must reach his perfection in a people i think faith has never been given a square deal by the church yet it has given birth to all of men's greatest achievements you have men like sam walton who had faith in the power of bulk purchases and it made him millions and in stores in every county across america and then even in in across the world you had a man by the name of henry ford who had faith in a low-priced automobile and that every man could afford and um you see this this faith is what drove him to achieve and faith is the greatest element in advanced civilization is as humans we've um it is faith that gives birth to such achievements in the natural realm so the believer's faith in the father and his word it also gives birth to spiritual achievements and brother branham taught us that faith is like hyssop it's everywhere you know it was like a common weed that they were told to apply the blood with and it grew up in every crack everywhere you look actually there is faith there is common faith there's mental faith there's spiritual faith there's all types of faith and faith we know then comes by hearing and hearing the word of god so it's really important to hear god's word and to feed upon it and if the holy ghost is in you we know then the word is in you and the power is in you and god's own ability is in you i'm going to share this little quotation from the sermon perseverance he said i believe that virtue is in christ and christ is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us now the word itself comes back in the form of the holy spirit into us and it's the word in you god in you so many wants to point god to some mythical something way out away or so far away they overreach it god is in you the hope of glory christ the mind of christ in you you're reaching plum away from it trying to get what has been given to you god in the human being so we know then every one of us then have been given a measure of faith faith is something that can grow it can expand it can it can reach higher levels where that you can reach things and do things that you couldn't do without it um brother branham said in in greater than solomon he said if i could get this audience with one accord to see and know exactly that jesus christ is alive and here among you or he said oh you physically or mentally believe it but when it can go beyond the mind till you know it then something will happen when you can realize and the only thing is to see christ in our presence now sometimes we're gonna and somewhere and somehow we're gonna have to get our heads on on straight as satan's desire is to make this bride a weak and a powerless and a faithless people and let me just say some things very um very direct this morning because satan has he has all but stripped the power out of the entire message movement by shifting the emphasis from the supernatural power of god with signs and wonders to head knowledge of the word and this gives preachers and their congregants a sense of superior spirituality by having head knowledge of the message just an intellectual conception and their heads are in the clouds up there somewhere with all this superior knowledge and they don't know a thing about the supernatural experience with a supernatural god now head knowledge and intellectual conceptions is not the mind of christ the supernatural is the mind of christ but we have the word and the insinuation is then that healing and miracles and signs and wonders and gifts of the spirit and leadership of the holy ghost is is not needed and i just want to say so said the backslidden church down through the ages and you you cannot have the true word without the supernatural amen it is impossible amen and i want you to say we are not sign seekers and we are not to be sign seekers we are seekers however we seek his life how many this morning would say i'm a seeker and i'm seeking his life because with his life comes everything else now there are sign secrets they want signs for their entertainment and we know that happened even in brother bratton's ministry people flop just to see and be entertained by um a blind eye coming open or a deaf hearing or or some miraculous to be done it was almost like a magic show you know they want signs to show there are there are others that want sign to show their greatness and and for attraction or or wealth or the popularity that it would bring this is why the god can't trust many people we we're spiritual gifts is because they take it and make up it's something that's not intended and and they're like um they're like simon the sorcerer who wanted to buy the gift or the secret to laying on their hands where the people were empowered by the holy ghost and but but i wanted to say you know the bride of christ is not a gold digger she reunites to him because of his love amen she wants his life his word his love his power and all that he is amen our reason for expecting the signs to follow them that believe is not for our ego or for our pride it's not to set us apart as a special people or a different people or somebody with mystic power yeah we have seen the gold digging in the and the gold diggers the the uh healing evangelists and we've seen the gold digging denominations with their wealth amen yes we have seen the gold digging preachers who strung along the congregation who was attracted to them for promises of gold and god's blessings and for prosperity but that's not who the bride is she loves him and wants to see his life and all that he is manifested through her amen it's not even for our vindication amen it is because jesus gave us that commission to heal the sick cast out devils freely give as we be freely received and and if we're not going if we're not doing it we are not his church amen signs will automatically follow true doctrine i don't know how we got it that if we got two doctrines we don't have signs amen but if we got true doctrines there's gonna be signs followed amen amen so well you know brother tim though the the uh susan movement we we had gifts and healings and miracles and yet all kinds of era of doctrine that's right but you can't have true doctrine without the supernatural amen without without gifts without healing without miracles it is impossible to have true doctrine and not have it are you with me well buddy though brother tim we we got something greater we got the seals the opening of the seals opened up the book and all of its promises it did not take away the promises it opens up the whole land with every divine promise there is come on well you know brother jim i tell you i've seen it where the holy spirit was moving and one side of the congregation was in eunice and saying open up your gates and and the king of glory should come in and the other side answers and said well who is this king of glory the lord mighty in bible but we had arab brother tim we didn't have the pure word well i just say why can't we have both amen why why can't we have both why can't we have the word and the spirit amen why do we have to forfeit one for the other amen and why do we have to favor one over the other come on amen we can have both we can have the word and the spirit we can have everything the bible said we can have come on and i want to just say then and also again why do we keep emphasizing the mockery of it the faults the rome brother bradham told us in the sermon christ he said you say i can't believe in divine healing i can't believe in the miraculous oh i've seen this and you know you can just go into what we've seen oh we got a lot of mockery but we got the real holy spirit too and that's right why is there so much mockery on that side why is there so much on that side where does the clubs lay in an apple orchard under the best tree that's right you've got to have a a counterfeit and then if there is no counterfeit then what then what you're looking at is a counterfeit but if there's a copy somebody is trying to make it like like it and that proves there's a real one just open up your mind one time and let and think a little while for yourself and don't take so many people's other other people's word for it take god's word for it and again i want to say why do we have to keep emphasizing the mockery it ain't like we got a problem that we're just so overrun with miracles and signs and wonders and whatever else and we got too many of them we need to cut back on it all right hello amen yeah there's a mockery of speaking in tongues and it has been emphasized until nobody wants to speak in amen you know we're we're beyond that brother tim well how did you get beyond the word that's what i want to know how do we get beyond the word this is the word amen even even the signs follow them that believe they so speak with new tongues is that right there's some mockery of false prophets or or healings has been emphasized until true prophecies and healings are not wanted amen and this has produced a culture of unbelief and a rejection of the full word where we're favoring you know some great intellectual knowledge over the supernatural realm oh and i can already hear them saying oh but you better be careful there's anointed ones at the end time and i just want to remind you yep we're one of them [Music] amen we sure are because there's a bride who is the anointed one for this day she is anointed to fulfill the old testament even as christ the groom fulfilled the old testament so there is an anointed one at the end time and the rain let me remind you was not sent for the tear the rain was sent for the wheat god poured out the holy spirit not for the tear out here god poured out the holy spirit to bring a wheat into maturity so you want to say you want to hold behind us in a flag and say don't you know tears are over here shouting and rejoicing because of the rain well the only reason they got rain is because rain has been poured out on the week [Music] so why just point out the anointed false ones why don't we have to why don't we come to the realization the truth must be anointed wouldn't you but brother jim would you rather have love than miracles and signs and wonders because miracles and signs and wonders can be impersonated well so can love did we forget that you know so can all the fruits of the spirit well but but you know brother brother tim you it'll just see the very elect if it were possible with all of these signs and line signs and wonders and all of that and so we don't want to have anything to do with this well you better not have love joy peace long suffering gentleness meekness is that right because brother branham used the kind of priests and showed that he had more of that than jesus did impersonation it's an age of impersonation but that doesn't mean that the real can't be manifested amen so again again fruits of the spirits can be impersonated as much as emotions are miracles so i asked for a little bit of the same same time you know given to preaching against the fruits it's preaching against miracles hello don't hang up on me that confused you i know i just say give equal time amen again you know again i want to just ask you why can't we have both yes i want to say we must have both we can't just be a fruitless people without the fruits of the holy spirit of love joy peace long suffering gentleness meekness patience and all of that again such there is no law we can't just have that and not have the other the working of the supernatural a supernatural god among us we gotta have the supernatural at the altar we gotta have the supernatural and the pew we gotta have the supernatural in the pulpit amen so why are we forced to make a choice why do we have to settle for something less than the full gospel how many would say today i want the full gospel i want everything god promised i'm not taking anything out of the book i want the whole lamb i'm not giving any of it up to the enemy he gave me the land and i want it all amen we want everything from the negative to jordan we want everything and every promise we want we want every every promise that god made we want it to be ours we're not going to let the devil come along and fence a portion off of it and say stay out of here it's our land now again i wanted to share with you brother you know the other side just for a moment in christ the mystery brother branham said if a man says he is born again and he tries to place these promises of christ in the last day to some other age making him christ yesterday but not today then that man or that person has been in a delusion by satan and if that man says he believes that and it doesn't manifest through him jesus said in mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe into all the world into every age casting out devils speaking with tongues and all these great manifestations of gifts that would follow that they shall not they may be they ought to they will and heavens and earth will pass away but his word won't amen again just uh another one here from the easter seal and i could have read i could raise to stand here the whole service and and just read one after another but we're just going to take a couple here and because i'm going to show you where brother branham stood on this in the easter seal he said i was listening to a radio program on k-a-r-r down in tucson his minister taking his side against us that the pentecostal religion was nothing but just a sham not to listen to it it was unstable said anyone that spoke any man that spoke in tongues and these things and claimed to be healed the sick and so forth by prayer that there was to leave away from and to pray for those poor decrepit people because they were all in an illusion that there was something wrong with him and he said oh how i would like to talk to that brother just a while and he said that that was only given for the apostles at the day of pentecost and that was that was all and i find he said 30 years later paul was ordaining these gifts in the church in first corinthians 15 he set the church in the church the gift of speaking in tongues miracles and all these other gifts was set in the church and jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature how far all the world who too every creature and they have never received it yet amen and these signs shall follow them that believe how long all the world who too every creature amen these signs shall follow them in my name they shall cast out devils speak with new tongues if they taken up deadly things or serpents or drink a deadly thing it would not harm them they'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that was the last commission to the church mark 16 chapter and paul is ordaining these gifts into the church 30 years later and galatians 1 8 said if an angel from heaven preaches to you any other gospel than this which is already received see already been preached let it be let him be accursed and i believe that pentecost began without ending i believe it's to be to every creature all times to all places that pentecost should always remain the pentecostal blessings should be upon the people amen now so this is really really important because the mind of christ is the supernatural it's not an intellectual conception again see the discrepancy and i've always i've always loved this quotation when a man stands and says he's a gospel preacher and he says the days of miracles has passed that's the seed of discrepancy when a man stands and said he's a minister a pastor of a church or somewhere that and he does not believe that jesus christ is the same in every detail except the physical body same yesterday today and forever that seed of discrepancy when he says that miracles in apostolic ages passed that seed of discrepancy and when they say there's no such thing as divine healing that seeded discrepancy and the world is full of it and it crowds out and it chokes out the wheat amen i've got some more things to share on that choking here in just a moment but i want you to understand these things that are being said it chokes out the wheat now we must fulfill the great commission jesus could not tell us to preach the gospel and all the world and now we've had seven church ages and we only come back to the last age where the true gospel is restored again how many understands that amen we are in a day of restoration luther didn't have it wesley didn't have it down to the ages they they left the true gospel they left the correct baptism the correct godhead the original sin predestination the security of the believer more and more and more we can just go down the line of what they left is that right but we're an hour of restoration amen and so god would have to restore the original gospel back again the original word that fell on the day of pentecost the gospel of jesus christ now this is important because jesus said this gospel must be preached into all the world and then the end can come how many wants the end to come then the gospel must be preached what this gospel not method is baptist pentecostal catholic is this gospel the original gospel the word in power must be preached into all the world so the end can come amen brother branham was clear he said preaching is not teaching he said it is demonstrating the gospel and the gospel must be preached demonstrated in the sermon christ brother branham said you're not using your own thoughts you're using his thoughts let the mind that was in christ being you see they think his way of thinking say what he says confession means to say the same thing confess us to confess the same thing say the same thing that don't confess your own mental conception be born again and confess his word amen confess what he said that's confession by his stripes that was healed say by stripes i have a right by his wounds right now i have a right for salvation amen i have a right for the holy spirit he promised it to me he said it's for you and your children and them that is afar off and as many as the lord our god shall call i believe it he said it's it's for any generation lo i'm with you always even to the end of the world he died that he might riot raise again and be with his church all the way to the end of the world to confirm the word with signs following how far was it to be go ye didn't end it with the apostles mark 16 go ye to all the world preach the gospel to every creature it's never met there yet just about a third of it god is depending on us so it's on our shoulders amen to preach the full gospel and to demonstrate what is written in the word to manifest what has been promised amen now you know brother branham said some very shocking things in shreveport louisiana when he was there at jack morris tabernacle because he just flat out told them he said we know the modern church in his present condition and present state is in no condition to finish up the great commission that god gave the church for this day and he said how many pentecostals can say amen to that i'm pretty sure they were mom now he said the pentagon we know the church could not the pentecostal church by no means by no means could carry out the last day message in his present condition could it why it can't even agree on one or two words in the bible well how you going to get it to going to do it it can't do it so you see denomination is out it's going to be an elected people that is elected for it and i want to say i believe we are that elected people amen he said we know the church and that condition could not finish up the last day how could it bring in malachi 4. amen and you've got to have malachi 4 you've got to have a prophet to whom the word the lord comes to in order to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers to bring the restoration that is needed amen so he said how could he believe and bring in saint luke 17 30. about how could it bring in all these other scriptures that's promised the last day it couldn't do it because it denies it as it was in the days a lot so shall they be in the coming of the son of man finish up the great commission he says how could they do it we know they're dead god let it die in this scientific age after also what so he could do what open up the seven seal mystery to the undenominational bride when it's absolutely contrary to denominational thinking serpent seed all these other things the whole seven mysteries is contrary to what they've been taught because they took it took the old school from their bible school but you know we didn't get it from a bible school but about that time amen when i was about to make a horrible mistake when i was going to go back to the old schools and the books and the things and say what they said about that time he came in the room and he changed my thinking [Music] amen now god opened the seven seals to reveal the mysteries of the book so that we could go forth with a full gospel to finish the great commission i want you to keep that in mind we are the finished race there's none coming after us we are the last generation well look look you can see diseases are coming in they don't know what to do with shutting down the world shutting down their economies riots that are taking place that they don't even have they don't even have the backbone to stop there's no cheats in the law there's no there's no there and and it isn't even the law it's the moral fiber of the country has gone down and the united states as well as the world has been invaded by demons and homes are not set on the bible anymore [Applause] i remember they're set on the popular thinking of the world and satan has given his mind the mind of the beast to the world we're living in you've never seen it where in just a generation we have changed the whole thinking of people the whole morals of people and we did it with television and songs and movies we put in a homosexual agenda in our movies we too we took and made mockeries out of dads come on amen we took and made we took and made mockery out of a homemaker with with uh we love lucy am i made her look like a stupid idiot come on we started with systematically destroying the fiber of the family and the morals of the home and the church has not stood against it and worldliness is coming to the church and it's allowed the mind and the thinking of satan to take preeminence over the word of god and i'm just going to say it sermons like god of this evil age and satan's seed and some of the you know the flats and red lights of the simon is coming they wouldn't be welcome in many places today many homes it's a foreign voice it's so archaic it's so out of step it's so oh god help me to stay out of step with the world help me lord to walk with you help me lord not to take on their mind help me lord to keep the right mind amen but it's coming in it comes into home it comes into our thinking listen to you you you sometimes we we are asleep as to what is going on in our nation and our world but you know we we've set our colleges and our schools full of curriculums and and teachers who are teaching a liberal agenda who are destroying and undermining the very fibers of the home amen and they're set they're full to their poison a whole generation of people and they've changed the minds of people to a godless society and if you're not careful it'll do the same thing in your life and it takes the woman and takes her out of her place in the home and as a mother and the value of motherhood and puts her there where she is nothing and nobody unless she's a career girl and now the woman even in message homes has more authority and more more dominion than than the than the man who the bible said is the head of the house [Applause] amen then our dress and our styles and everything else goes to be patterned with what's acceptable out there and what looks chick and cool and hot [Music] amount is the truth this is where we are in this day amen it's aware that it's on sex and violence and people are being fed a whole belly full of it because and they are they are they are taking the seal and digesting and it comes in their mind and it permeates their and controls their thinking but i want you to know there's a supernatural coming down there is a real holy ghost that'll give you a saying thinking in an insane world we need the supernatural more than we've ever needed it we need to know a supernatural god a supernatural power that'll change our lives in a supernatural way [Applause] [Music] the five identifications are different definite identifications of the true church brother branham identified what a true church would be and he said and you that don't believe in divine healing your churches this is tape you understand i'm not only talking to you somebody else is going to hear it your churches claim that you believe in god and believe it in the commission that your church is commissioned to take the gospel and the very first thing is divine healing what was the very what was the first thing jesus told his disciples when he sent them out now but listen you you know you can look at me like i'm strange this morning but actually divine healing has been ostracized and put down we're in a day well we got medicines and we got doctors and we believe in them hey man we're not we're not coming down on doctors in medicine but i want to tell you something church god was before medicine and his healing was was before all of this laodicean age amen and we we're going to have to if we can't believe in divine healing how are we going to believe for rapture [Applause] amen amen as brother branham would say over and again if i can't get you to believe even for divine healing how am i going to get you to believe for the change of your body we won't believe that god can just heal part how could you believe god to heal the whole amen now what was the first thing jesus told his disciples when he sent them out heal the sick cast out devils what was the last thing he said to this church heal the sick cast out devils amen outfit omega benjamin and reuben first and last he that was which is and shall come the morning star the root offspring of david hallelujah that's him these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devil just at jerusalem to all the world every creature is that the bible that's what it says that is the message of the church all the world every creature the gospel to everyone that believes these signs shall follow amen that's the message of the church in my name they shall cast out devil let me tell you something salvation is casting out devils nobody can get saved till the devil's cast out now you know the cast out may not be an exorcism in that way where we're screaming and yelling that will come out but it's the same thing you've got to you've got to dethrone the devil in your life amen all the cigarettes and the all the the dope and all the sin and the habits of the world have got to go amen it's you gotta die to that and that's gotta be cast out of your life and you have victory over it amen you're not gonna be the same old thing same as you was your life is gonna be different you'll tally up to the word now so that's the message of the church that's what he commanded the church to do to cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink a deadly thing it'll not harm them they'll lay hands on the sick they shall recover that's the commission of the church that is the real believing church is that taught in the methodists baptist presbyterian catholic lutheran nazarene pilgrim holiness no sir they deny it why they're organized and they can't do it there's many a member in there that believes that but he can't say anything about it because he'll be excommunicated that's the antichrist spirit that's got to organize you see it bound them down it chokes it out the church of the living god is free born of the spirit it don't need any denomination they fi that follow the king of the messianic kingdom they don't have to they don't have to take the people's things they're free born they're made free by the son who makes them free indeed these signs shall follow them now it goes on and he says now another thing the church will teach will be divine healing he's emphasizing the message of the church wait a minute brother tim the divine healing it's a minor it's the message of the church now it's only a minor when compared to which is healing of the soul healing of the body comes secondary but it's not a minor when it comes to the bible and jesus ministry or the prophet's ministry or the bride's ministry but we have de-emphasized it we don't need it you know i mean i've personally been in a place where where the you know they they i preached and this well we're going to have a prayer line because some of you you know you can't have faith enough to receive it out there so we'll get up here and let you hands laid on you so he you know goes on for about 15 minutes of why why you're faithless if you come in a prayer line and finally they call the prayer line i was surprised anybody came after that but they did and then when i you were there and and then when when we went to pray for the sick you know you know oh no just lay hands on them you know no no no excitement no no no earnest prayers like they just lay hands on them pass them by pass them by and the guy stood right there and then just shoved them right through just like cattle going through an auction that was in a message church now but this church will teach divine healing the message of the church i just quoted he said matthew 10 1 and when he had called unto him his 12 disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of diseases a church who is not casting out devils is not a god called church amen the first that was his first commission to the church the last commission was go into all the world preach the gospel to every nation and demonstrate the power of the holy ghost he that believeth on this is baptized shall be saved he that denies it will be damned these signs will follow them that believe they will lay hands on the sick they shall recover they will cast out devils they'll speak with new tongues and this will be the signs that will follow and the last verse says and they returned and the lord working with them confirming the word with signs following that's the way the first church was and jesus said i'm the mind you're the branches and if a branch brings forth a vine then that vine and that vine that bears grapes then the next branch comes forth it'll bear just like the first branch did he said but brother branham when we look at all of these churches he says those are grafted mines you can grab citrus fruit you can make an orange treat and put a lemon on it and it'll grow that's what man grafted in and these organizations what man grafted in it's a lemon all the time it'll grow because it's stuck out in the church's name but let me tell you if that tree ever puts forth another branch it'll bear an orange and if the power of god ever puts forth another church it'll be another pentecost and another book of acts will be wrote behind it because it is the church of hallelujah amen how many believes that we're in the day where of the tree amen the vine christ has put forth another branch hallelujah then she's gonna be a fruit baron branch amen shall write another book of acts behind it not the acts of wicked men but the acts of the holy ghost that's why brother branham said we're trying to get the church this is perfect faith trying to get the church i wonder if we could just try to get the church into a place where we can really see apostolic times moving among us that's what we all hunger and it's just laying right at the door see we why we see it but we want to see more of it we want it to flow such a flow that will be a help to us and us flow out to others amen so these apostolic times are not to repeat of the turmoil and strife found in the book of acts those were the acts of carnal men the the apostolic times that are promised are the result of the original vine putting forth another branch from himself and the holy spirit acting in the believer as he did back then of course we can look in the book of acts and we can see carnality we can see divisions we can see strife and way but let me tell you that's not what was promised to be restored it's the acts of the holy spirit that's what's promised to be restored somebody with me amen so again and does god change his mind he says we're missing the power we ought to have where the big machine ought to be up running and great signs and wonders well this building ought to be setting so full of the power of god now to a sinner couldn't stay in here the holy spirit condemned it right quickly like ananias and fire and he said we're missing something amen in the message communion the last sermon brother branham would preach he said you know the hour will soon arise when right among us will be the holy spirit will speak out like it did with an anonymous fire remember the hour is arriving and you now you just remember that see god is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now amen and we need to become that kind of a church amen i'm not so much i'm i'm not so much interested in interested in striking people dead i want to see sin struck dead i believe struck dead i want to see life working in the body [Applause] [Music] amen amen instead of tearing for the baptism of the holy ghost this is god of this evil age again one of his last sermons instead of tarin for the baptism of the holy ghost let signs prove to her the holy ghost was only for the disciples instead of keeping the vine healing going when she ought to be now raised in the dead and doing great miracles she has let satan under his leadership a religious man take the word of god and try to say it was for another age and she's believed it amen jesus said i'm the vine and you are the branches and it's not the vine that bears fruit it's the branches that are to bear fruit but i want you to look at the fruit we're seeing denominational fruit on the vine why is this you know again because every kind of other thing has been grafted into it we haven't kept the message pure amen but every kind of thing has been grafted in listen brother madam said you know again if the power of god ever puts forth another church it'll be another pentecost another book of acts will be wrote behind it because it's the church of god amen now so now we might ask how will we know it's god's mind how we know will we know it's god we'll know him by his nature amen we'll know him by his works amen no no we won't be a bunch of shouting emotional people and no life to go with it no it will not be a bunch of signs and wonders and and and no no forgiveness and no love and and no power of grace no it won't be this it'll be a full gospel not just a part are you with me amen if the church that come off of that vine was a pentecostal church with all the gifts if that ever really puts out another branch they'll write another book of acts behind it that's what they had in the days of the apostle and the apostolic age never ended now let's go from there let's talk about the mind for a moment there's a sermon that i think you ought to pour over just really pour over a couple of them actually one of them's word made flesh in india trip and the other is the fundamental foundation for faith and man it'd be good to to go over them and really study them so he says now if we could completely throw ourselves to god into his will and be lost to our own thoughts and let the mind of christ be in us then them same operations of the spirit would work through us just as natural things does because we were first created for that purpose to control to rule and to praise god and live for god amen you know the word dominion has almost been lost from the church god made you to have dominion that's what he was giving you he said these sign will follow them that believe i give you dominion over devils i give you dominion over unclean spirits i give you dominion over sickness diseases i'm giving you dominion now jesus said if you abide in me my words abide in you you can ask what you will it shall be done for you and if you abide in me and my words abide in you he said the father in his word is ex inseparable because the word is the son in the beginning was the word and the word was with god the word was god the word was made flesh and dwelt among us god and his word is inseparable you cannot have god without having his word and when you have his word you have god amen now he said if you want to look a little further as far as back a little further as a historical you could see the word in the beginning was the word but what what what is the word a word is a thought manifested a thought spoken forth god first perceived the thought and he spoke it and it became a word and the word became material so everything that god has spoken his word received in the right channel will materialize that word for whatever promise that is behind it god will do it he's obligated to do it amen amen now then that's that's where we want to come this is what we were singing this song a moment ago we want him to have his way in our life we want to be the channel become a channel a cleaned out channel and remember we're not strapped up but where the word can flow through us where healing can flow and deliverance can flow listen you need peace to flow even in your own home in your own situation be able to change atmosphere you need salvation for your children and but we need it in the church becoming a channel the holy spirit can move through so he says and then if you abide in me my word abide in you then you have god the word in you and you believe in the word uh just as you believe god you believe the word just as you believe god because it is it is god and it's inseparable then if you have god's word in you you have god's life in you you have god in you and whatever god's word speaks forth out of you it'll have to come to pass just like it was spoke from god those are incredible words oh yeah so then we must get in the right channel we must get in the right channel god's ordained a bride to be in this position you are here for such a time as this when all the rest of the world is going insane and you can see the insanity coming upon the world amen it's all happening everywhere that you look that in that moment in that time there's got to be a bride with the mind of christ who knows what he wants done with his word now jesus said whatever you ask the father in my name that will i do did you ever realize what that means you realize if we go before god in the name of jesus it's just the same as jesus himself praying it isn't me praying anymore if i come in his name and he recognizes his name jesus said ask the father in my name that i will do and then i go to the father in jesus name it isn't me praying anymore it's jesus it's his spirit praying through me and then i've got to receive what i've asked for because he said it and it's god's own word and they can do nothing else but just produce what it said amen now man was originally made to walk in the mind of god he didn't use his own thinking about things he worked by the mind of god the realm of faith was real to him it was not an elusive darkened knowledge i'd like you to turn with me to ephesians 4 and 8 because paul talks about us when we were sinners he said having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of christ through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart so you can see their understanding is darkened being alienated from the life of god to the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart that's the way we were born that's why that when you're born again it has to be of faith and faith gives you a vision the ability to see god's word and his promises amen now the bible speaks of this condition of the sinful uh mind as a corrupt mind a mind that is blinded by the god of this world but that's not the way it was with adam when it was in the hands of adam adam was a channel to whom the word could work through amen he never had to be sick he never had to die he never had to worry you know he never had a heartache he never had a fear he just climbed up in the arms of his father was just like a child everything was his everything obeyed him because he was god's child and the child is the heir of all things right and when man fell he lost this but and now when he what he lost in the fall christ came as a redeemer i want you to know jesus brought back everything that man lost so therefore through the new birth you have the ability to be led as adam was and be a channel to work the will of god through [Music] amen now so god came there to bring us back to fellowship and relationship with god to be his sons and his daughters and he came to restore back everything that adam lost in the fall through redemption he offered you a renewed mind that your mind could be transformed by the renewing of your mind amen so we're we're invited then to be molded into his image not to take on the image of the beast of what the world is now taking on the image of why is all this violence and hate and all this stuff because they are taken and manifest in the image of the beast itself of the depravity of man why is there fatherless homes why is there motherless homes come on why is there marriage and divorce and remarriage and all this other stuff that is going on today amen it's because that man has left god but where god offers the redemption for you to take on his mind and then you'll think differently you'll think differently about everything from drug to alcohol to the way you dress the way you talk amen even your attitude about the bible whether whether it's relative or not everything will change when you take on the mind of god amen now so you're invited to come into his image and take on his image i want to stress it to you remember the bride he will marry will be in his image she will be of his species she will be of his kind she will be bold of his bone and flesh of his flesh and life of his life and power of his power she is him now so then when we let his character be in us then we become his sons having the mind of christ and that because your mind makes your character it molds the character of a son now again in the fundamental foundations of faith brother branham said now the thing of it is since he restored man back to his place now since redemption man in the fall lost his conscience of what the father put him on earth to do and that's the whole thing you lost your conscience of why you're here we are not here to be uh anarchist we're not here to be caught up in the world movements we are not here to be caught up in and even trying to fix society that is not a message amen it's the wrong message if that's what's being preached that's what brother branham would deal with it wasn't it wasn't that he disagreed with martin luther on how martin luther king on how people were treated they were mistreated but he was saying that you can never really get social justice by passing laws the only thing that will bring it is by baptism of the holy ghost and then nobody's big and nobody's little and then we're of all of one race and that's the god race [Applause] and that that way nobody this and ain't important and this is important we're all imparted because we're all god's children [Applause] and when we preach the baptism of the holy ghost and the power of god in the supernatural and people get born again it takes our prejudice out of your life it takes out the big idea big you big me and little you [Applause] [Music] that's why brother bratton would often say the calico dress can hug with the silk one amen call him sister exactly amen the overall can hug the you know the man in the tuxedo because and say brother because there's no difference we all become of one class that's the god class amen but you see but again uh again as we're talking about this man fell in the fall lost conscience of what the father put us on earth to do i wonder sometimes if we miss even you know what the bride is supposed to do well what are we to be in this age in this time what kind of people are we to be are you with me amen so again we we he says in other words and he explained this way all diploma all the plumbing as it was in our brains the outlet the faith has been clogged up with business affair with home life with domestic things it's all become so clogged up until god came operate through those channels that he made man for he made you for something different than just living here and making a life here in laodicea god made you to be a son or a daughter of god amen to take dominion over sin over unrighteousness over sickness over disease are you with me church amen but we have let our channels become clogged through the fall you know ours our our thoughts are set on self-perseverance or self-perseveration i mean and we're gonna preserve ourselves and we're going to do this and we're going to try that and and we're worried about all of the life's affairs until we forget why we are here why are we here until god can't operate through those channels the channel is clogged where god can't operate through that's what the message came for was to open up our hearts to the full word of god amen dr moses brother bradham said it this way he said you know what i began to believe christian friend that we're living in the beginning of the greatest time that the world has ever witnessed now he was back there in 55 when he said that that was a year after i was born but he says we're living in the beginning of the greatest time the world has ever witnessed and i just believe that all the lines are getting unclogged you know clogged up with all kinds of doctrines theologies all kinds of stuff unbelief has been handed down from generation to generation oh there's no such thing as healing days and miracles are passed and we just automatically believe it it says in getting in the spirit he said he said um um you know he's talking about making those valleys full of ditches it's a it's a story of the bible the days of eliza where he was told you know where they didn't have water so well you know dick valley's full of ditches he said about daylight they began to notice the waters came and they didn't know where it came from it was there all the time they had just clogged it up and he said there's power in the church i can tell you and i can tell any minister i can show you where god gave the church power to heal the sick cast out devils all these things and now you come and put your finger on the scripture where jesus said now i take it back away from the church but what he said what's happened what's the matter you've got it clogged up your own self-made ideas of it has clogged it up amen i can tell you what jesus promised in the last day and show you that these signs that you've seen done that the spirit of god would come into the church and so and so visions and and so forth like that as he's doing and you try to disprove it one time and find out where you're at amen he talks about the queen of sheba how that she was a seeker she came from a far country seeking her real faith and set her heart to see whether whether or not what she was hearing was the truth she was determined he said if the rumor of this meeting because she'd heard a rumor and she comes from way from the far east to the meeting he said if the rumor of this meeting in indianapolis had only a set up a career a creation of people to come and see whether this bunch of people has the real holy spirit or not amen to see whether there's such thing as a baptism of the spirit and they would have done it if they hadn't choked their life out with some church creed or some worldly amusement but i have to believe there's some seekers somewhere [Music] that says i don't want my life choked out amen and i'm not going to do it with worldly music or some creed or or some theology but i'm going to believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and i'm going to become a channel that the word can flow through handwriting on the wall he said the vine of formulism is growing around the church and choking the spiritual life of the church so god send in the sickle and the grubbing hole and cut all the weeds that choking out the church amen all all the great spiritual blessings of the church that deserve it deserves it that jesus died for that it might receive maybe a hundredfold tonight of a great shower of his blessings upon the people now i'd say this is the way we ought to be god make us a place where that a rumor goes out amen there's a real healer in the church amen that church isn't barren but that church has life in it there's a power laying in that church in those people there are people that believe a man that preached that he's the same yesterday today of her and the practice of praying people of people that's calling on god amen people that are more interested in his presence amen that worried about where they're sitting in the church they just want his presence they want his power they want him to move at the church a people who's calling on god lord change lives amen there are those that are dying they're the lost that needs to be saved lord let me find lay some soul on my heart and love that soul through me let me be a witness of my job in school or wherever i have a testimony of jesus christ after promised restoration of the word and the power are we going to be just slumped down again choked by unbelief it was denominational moves it choked the spirit out saying days of miracles are passed it is easy believism that has choked out the true baptism of the holy ghost we have choked out the spirit of god for wisdom wisdom versus faith he said now the protestants got choked out it choked the spirit right out of them when they begin to take wisdom instead of faith in the word the wisdom in the organization the organizational wisdom instead of faith in the word now let me just stop here i want you to look at john wesley's move everybody's heard of the methodist right it was a sanctification move now john wesley's movement well the hell was you in the wesley movement the methodists yeah yeah all right here's a man right there from the methodist church god delivered him you know why you know why he's here because he saw the fallacy of it you know why he isn't an elder in that church and a deacon in there and because he promised him every kind of position amen because they had homosexuals in the pulpit come on amen isn't it good to know hey you may meet the next brother l that is out there in the system somewhere that is just longing to hear the truth [Applause] who's going to meet the next brother album sister felicia amen and how who's going to be the next one i mean they're hungry souls that are out there just like them [Applause] glory to god now but let me just say you see what happened john wesley's move started out as the saudi methodists they had a move of god and as the word was preached they would fall out under the spirit and their lives would be changed they would actually fall out they they would they would go get water and throw it in their faces there to wake them up again because they'd get so overcome with the spirit huh you can't even find the breath of the spirit there anymore amen it got choked out many years ago by modernism by formalism by lifeless programs hello let me just read you what a study that i just did recently and i only did it on the methodist church because it was the last move in the sixth age but methodist methodism was transformed from a religion of poor people to one of middle class respectability so you know they were transformed from these poor people who shouted rejoice have spirit moving among them live sanctified are you with me amen they they they um you know the enthusiastic groups that was in that holiness movement fell away broke away changes begin in the leadership as the elder was redesignated as district superintendent no longer was the elder supposed to be an inspirational leader but now he was the business and administrative office think of that it didn't require him to be spiritual it required him at being good at money and programs and building up a church attracting members come on amen and transform them from poor people to striving to be more a little bit more uppity the transformation of methodistism in the 19th century from the religion of the unwashed and uneducated to a denomination of respectability owed much to the denomination's embrace of education methodists by the mid-1960s century had established more colleges than all but one other denomination belief in the effectiveness of christian education for children also contributed to the prominence of education and methodism the poor farmers who compromise early methodism modernize themselves move to town use the moral standards and in interpersonal skills and they learn that they learned in church to make themselves middle class as methodism sought towards social respectability in the 19th century churches replaced the primitive emotionalism of camp meeting conversions with a more gentile intellectual process that led incrementally to conversion in other words you grow into token life you involve into being a christian we're going to teach you how to become good and that took the place of the primitive emotionalism of church me a camp meeting conversions i'll tell you what give me the old camp meeting conversions give me the power of the holy ghost am i not some intellectual con you know a concept where we kind of teach people how to be good and nice and good citizens and our class and and everything else no that's not what we want we want genuine new births changes in their lives [Music] children's literature published by the sunday school union taught the more respectable process of conversion the methodists were moving away from revivals and toward the notion of christian nurture that showed that children were the future so we have how to get along in marriage classes and financial classes and this becomes what we need instead of an old-fashioned altar and we go to educating the people into conversion how to be successful and a good person and this took away the spirit and the experience with god no more this shouting methodist when they become so overcome with the spirit until they would pass out quaking under the presence of god they would talk the more respectable conversion this led the methodist church today down the path of worldliness until 2020 this year the lgbt movement took over the leadership of the methodist church this is where it leads when we get away from the supernatural when we go toward the intellectual conception when we go into training come on rather than conversion when we go hey even when we're going to to cater to what the young people are doing and they're you know what the young people want to dress like it well whatever and we can't say anything about holiness and things anymore because we're catered to the young people we don't want to scare them off i'll tell you what i want to scare hell out of them hallelujah hey man i want to scare the devil out of them i will see the holy ghost fall and satan cast out and their lives changed and not conformed to me but confirmed in the word of god [Applause] i woke you up on that one this one brother branham said in the deceived church by the world every one of us everyone tries to think he's a little smarter than the other man each denomination method to say we got the smartest man the baptist say will say in the church of christ and so forth we're the smartest our people just don't let don't let the ordinary man go out and preach the gospel but they hand pick them oh god have mercy hand pick them until they're documented with a certain doctrine that they put them in the church and god can't touch him in no way i want somebody to preach to me that's been handpicked by the holy ghost god is raised up not picked by men or denominations amen all knowledge is oh we know all about it and someone don't know the first alphabet of the holy spirit they deny it amount i'll tell you what church the further we go along the more that you're going to see unani preachers about men who are not truly called of god but are placed in there for whatever reason amen we've already seen too many that mother called or daddy called or somebody else called instead of god called but you get a god called man he answers to god amen he'll preach the word of god he'll preach holiness he'll preach the power of god come on amen because he's called a god he wasn't set by man amen amen you see changes began in the leadership as the elder was redesignated as district superintendent sounds a little better don't it no longer was the elder to be an inspirational leader but now he's a business and administrative officer deceived church by the world brother branham said this reminds me of a little book and he tells a story of a little book that he'd read and he repeats the story and he says he said there that one one day in a great chicken pin there was a certain little rooster that thought he had all the knowledge to be known he flies up on a box you know and pets on it with this bill of four or five times and throws his little head back and forth and crowed like you never heard a rooster crow and he finally attracted the other's attentions and said ladies and gentlemen of this chicken pen i'd like to speak to you all this morning on some great educational program we have just designed i've required i've acquired a lot of knowledge in my study and he pulls his glasses over his bill and and he says i've i've decided that we chickens can better ourselves by knowledge by more knowledge therefore i tell you if we can just dig and work in a certain pen or whole we'll find a certain vitamin that'll make us grow better and prettier feathers and i'll tell you how we can embetter ourselves in many ways and the little pulitz with their little red cones just cackled and said oh but isn't he a darling and they admired him oh isn't he a brilliant little rooster he said it reminds me of seminary preachers such a brilliant man there's no need of us hanging around with the rest of the chickens we ought to go with him well before this little fella got through with his speech there was another chicken that didn't have bright feathers and he come running up from the chin the rest of the chicken yard he said boys just a minute i just heard the latest bulletin on the radio that chickens just went up four cents a pound and we're all going to slaughter tomorrow so what good your knowledge going to do and he said brother all the world the knowledge we can accumulate what good does it do we're six foot of dirt we're all dying by inches and minutes our knowledge means nothing we want to know him amen you know again he said he said a guy he told him another story of a little canary bird and this little canary bird he was really struck on his self and with such self-importance you know thought he had all the knowledge that he would ever need to to know he could tell all the rest of the canary birds all about the human being and he flies up on his cage and begins to to to speak about the human being and all that he knew about them and all of a sudden he walks up a a professor from a big college somewhere and begins to speak some high polished words to him and the little fellow just batted his eyes and turned his head and he said he had ears he could hear him why but he didn't know what he was talking about because all he had was a canary brain he hadn't got a human brain so he can't think like a human and neither can a human be and think like god you're human and all the world in knowledge is no more than a canary brain and all that you do you just hurt yourself with it you've got to have the mind of christ [Music] and that's the reason he said people joined organizations substitute a handshake today they substitute i believe the message and i believe god sent a prophet or i've got a tape library and the tape is my token and that's my holy ghost and and you know i i'm i'm gonna build a tape home you know what it is they don't know what the new birth is they have bypassed the new birth they we mean so they want to substitute for it and they're educating the children and brainwashing them into thinking if you believe a prophet you're going to be saved you better know jesus amen the pen he said the pentecostal people are just as bad trying to substitute something they try to substitute speaking in tongues right amen the others they want in class and just be so classy we'll shake hands join church sprinkled or baptized and he said they're afraid of the new birth he says i sometimes believe random tabernacles getting believed we're getting afraid of and i sometimes believe the whole message move is getting afraid of the new birth amen he said we we all know about a birth i don't care where it is whereabouts it's a mess a baby's born on a sheck pile on a hard floor or a pink decorated hospital room it's a mess anyhow a birthday calf a birth of anything is a mess and the new birth is nothing less than a mess but people go get so starchy we'll never go over where this we'll we'll go over where they shake hands we'll we'll go everywhere they don't bawl and cry and beat on the altar and cry out you know that this very same thing happened here sometime ago in a in a youth convention where they just had some teacher give some intellectual talk never had an altar called never had a move of god never had a crime there was never a dying out to sin and kids sitting there on pornography dabbling in drugs you insects needing jesus and just tell them you know how you know we're going to just accept the message and grow into christ and we'll just go around and you know your urine all you just need to do is just grow a mature little more some intellectual knowledge and somebody had the gall to say afterwards well wow i like these kind of services where there ain't no altar call and ain't nobody crying and snotting and everything else and crying out to god and i say you're a bunch of backslidden church members that don't know the power of the holy ghost you need the supernatural and the supernatural doesn't come by fancy teaching and intellectual knowledge even if you're preaching quote it doesn't come that way it comes by the power of god that changes your life the new birth he said is no less than a mess but people get so starchy we go where they shake hands and we and we'll go over where they don't bawl and cry and beat on the altar and cry out you want to be too human i'm talking to your prophet saying this we what we need as a birth dying out to bring forth life an old seed an old potato seed potato you take that potato put in the ground you can until you can have new potatoes all the potatoes gotta rot a corn can't produce new life until it's rotten right and a man or woman can never have a birth a new birth until they their intellectuals and their own self is rotted dead down at the altar scream and get all messed up to a place the scar starts gets out of your collar amen i'll tell you what it's time that some starch gets out of our collars amen that we become a channel that the holy ghost can move through amen where the spirit of god can flow in the church and we create an atmosphere where healings take place where deliverance take place where the holy ghost moves [Music] amen you're born again by the spirit of god i don't care if you squall speak in tongues jump up and down flop like a chicken with his head off you're bringing forth new life but we substituted something for it we wanted the classical way and look at the methodists they wanted it the classical way they wanted to get to where it was not an old camp meeting revival experience i tell you what i want a church to be i want it to be a retrence that's obvious god of people who know their god a people who the spirit of god can move about and sweep across a congregation brother branham said oh yeah he said they're pregnant they're expecting something but she because he's bringing forth members but she don't want none of these screaming hollering us blabbering acts 238 youngins oh no miserable creatures you know why they do that because just like any baby when life comes in that first breath comes in they scream out brother branham always told us if they don't scream out then the doctor gives him a little spanking he said he picks them up and puts a little he called it protoplasma stimulation i don't know what that means exactly except a spank on the bottom but you get that baby to breathing make him mad enough to cry amen do whatever you got to do to get that baby breathing come on amen that's what the preacher's got to do a lot of time he's got to make him mad enough to say i want jesus in my life i'm tired of sin i'm tired of the way i've been i'm tired of complacency i'm tired of being lukewarm i want the power of god in my life oh brother tim i want to be pregnant with the words you know the word birth word experience and the word you know you know it's it's not all this emotional stuff and brother branham said so you don't want to be impregnated with the word because that's the only kind the word can bring forth so i wonder what we're calling the word some type of he says you you said born of the spirit it has a spirit of god in it no intellectual church joined creed going bobbed hair painted faith no sense of that and that at all you don't find that in the word of god you find what the methodist didn't want an old-fashioned sanctified holy ghost-filled child born of the spirit of god screaming hollering shouting praising god that's what you'll find where the word is preached amen but they're so impregnated with satan's knowledge until that they have accepted the intellectual conception they might know no more about god than nothing their wisdom has strangled the holy spirit away from them now jesus thought it not robbery to be equal with god but he made of himself of no reputation and he humbled himself even to the death of the cross now god in return is looking for a people who's not trying to make a reputation who's not trying to be somebody but they don't think it's robbery to be born of his bone in flesh of his flesh and a joint air with him and they're willing to lay down their intellect even to the death of the cross even to death to self to let the word of god be supreme god wants to tell you you know we're told all the time we're human we're human exalt that human you know hey you know be good to yourself um you know that this is what the world says the church says you can't overcome you're human you're human you're human and god's trying to tell you you're not human you're a son of god by the new birth god's trying to let you know that there is an overcoming power that if you will clean out the channel the holy spirit can flow through you and you can overcome sin and sin will be as dead as midnight god's trying to tell you again that you can be a son of god and the power of god can flow through you that you can be a channel through whom he can work through brother branham would tell us over and over again he said he would tell us he said that we're sons of god and deity dwells in the man and he said this may choke you but then he dwells in you well i'll tell you we need to start believing that until they don't strangle us no more till we realize it can flow out it's to who we are yes sir i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god and i'm tired of letting the devil put a put a foot or knee on my throat and keeping the breath out of my life but i want the holy ghost in this church take your stinking knee off free this bride let her breathe let her rise up in power in the glory of god and a people know their god and do exploits let's stand together maybe the next service i can come and tell you what this bride is supposed to be like what god has designed her to be because she's to be in his image and in his likeness are you ready to surrender your life to god amen let's sing that song a flat let's see it i need the oh i need
