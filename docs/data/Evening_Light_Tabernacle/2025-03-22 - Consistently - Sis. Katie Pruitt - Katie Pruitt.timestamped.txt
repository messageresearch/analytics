[0:00] [Music]
[0:17] You are
[0:21] peace when everything around me is
[0:25] crumbling.
[0:27] [Music]
[0:29] You call me on the waves, then calm the
[0:35] sea. You are a
[0:39] peace. You are
[0:43] hope. When I have drifted far away
[0:47] [Music]
[0:50] from, I know that you'll be waiting down
[0:54] the road.
[0:57] You are
[1:01] home in the heartbreak, in the
[1:04] hurting. I will trust you in the
[1:08] waiting. You are always who you said you
[1:14] be. Consistently.
[1:19] [Music]
[1:20] [Applause]
[1:22] Oh, you are
[1:26] light and I am walking through the
[1:30] darkest
[1:32] [Applause]
[1:33] night. The word is there to guide me
[1:37] every
[1:39] time. You are
[1:43] alive in the heartbreak, in the
[1:46] hurting. I will trust you in the
[1:49] waiting.
[1:51] You are always who you said you
[1:57] be. In the breakthrough, in the
[2:00] blessing, I know you are never
[2:04] changing. You are always who you said
[2:08] you'd
[2:09] be.
[2:12] Consistently. There's joy in the
[2:15] morning, beauty in the burning.
[2:20] Only you were able to
[2:26] redeem. Mercy in the
[2:29] sunrise, breakthrough in the gray
[2:33] skies. Only you can help my eyes to
[2:37] see.
[2:40] Oh, there's joy in the
[2:43] morning, beauty in the burning.
[2:48] Only you were able to
[2:54] redeem. Mercy in the
[2:57] sunrise. Breakthrough in the gray
[3:01] skies. Only you can help my eyes to
[3:07] see. In the breakthrough, in the
[3:11] blessing, I know you are never changing.
[3:16] You are always who you said you'd
[3:22] be. At the mention of your name, you're
[3:26] close to
[3:28] me consistently.
[3:32] [Music]
[3:38] [Applause]
