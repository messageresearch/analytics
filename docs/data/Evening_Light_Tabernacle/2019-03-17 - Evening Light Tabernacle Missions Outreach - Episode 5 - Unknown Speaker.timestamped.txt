[0:05] hello everybody we're the ministry team
[0:10] at even in like tabernacle in Minden
[0:12] Louisiana a Bible believing Church and
[0:15] today we're here to proclaim once again
[0:18] that Jesus Christ is real he's the same
[0:21] yesterday today and forever a Living God
[0:24] they made one present for his people and
[0:28] we're happy that you joined us today for
[0:31] today's discussion and last week we
[0:34] ended on how do we receive the Holy
[0:38] Ghost and we went to the total
[0:41] prescription that Peter laid down one
[0:45] that cannot be tampered with it is the
[0:48] absolute prescription for the new birth
[0:53] and that is repent and be baptized every
[0:57] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:00] for remission of sins and you shall
[1:02] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and I
[1:04] think a viewer had a question and today
[1:08] we want to discuss that as we go into
[1:11] the true church and who she is this is
[1:15] the question that that was sent here it
[1:19] says if I have repented and been
[1:22] baptized does that mean I've also
[1:24] already received the Holy Ghost and so
[1:29] there is a question among people do they
[1:33] receive the Holy Ghost when they believe
[1:36] so in other words just by simple faith
[1:40] and making a profession of faith that is
[1:43] the Holy Ghost is that the common
[1:46] thought today it is but there's a
[1:49] there's a problem with that according to
[1:52] the scriptures because in acts 19 Paul
[1:59] passing through the upper coast of
[2:00] Ephesus finding certain disciples said
[2:02] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[2:04] you have believed
[2:06] yes and then he also says and after you
[2:09] believed you were sealed with that Holy
[2:11] Spirit of promise so you know it comes
[2:15] subsequent to believing not upon
[2:18] believing when you believe and you
[2:21] realize that Jesus Christ is the savior
[2:24] and you repent of your sins turning from
[2:28] them then you are a candidate for the
[2:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost that comes
[2:34] after believing in Christ so that begs a
[2:38] question for the people if they've
[2:41] repented are supposedly repented and
[2:43] been baptized and yet their life still
[2:46] doesn't manifest the Holy Ghost where is
[2:48] the issue well there's only one place it
[2:51] can be because if they were baptized
[2:53] correctly if they were about taps
[2:54] correctly in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:56] the only other step is repentance so
[2:59] there there had to be air somewhere in
[3:01] their repentance whereas it wasn't a a
[3:02] true repentance from the heart maybe
[3:04] they were sorry but there is a
[3:06] difference between being sorry and
[3:08] repenting Nathan even the Bible would
[3:10] say that Judas was sorry yes yeah
[3:12] there's an example of that in the
[3:14] scriptures in Acts chapter 8 Simon the
[3:19] sorcerer marveled at the miracles that
[3:22] was following Philip the Bible said that
[3:24] he was baptized but you find that Peter
[3:27] rebuked him and told him his heart was
[3:30] not right with them and there was an
[3:33] issue there because he thought that you
[3:34] could by the Holy Spirit and in that
[3:36] case he had not received it at that
[3:39] point because his heart was not right
[3:41] with God but if we genuinely repent and
[3:44] are baptized in Jesus Christ's name and
[3:47] are believing unto the promise of the
[3:49] Holy Spirit then the promise is sure we
[3:53] shall receive it God is obligated to
[3:55] amen amen
[3:56] so we were in our discussion on our last
[4:03] time about how that it wasn't so from
[4:07] the beginning and so that Jesus took us
[4:10] to the beginning yet as we have been
[4:13] talking there 41,000 different
[4:15] denominations and yet no man
[4:19] organize the Holy Ghost amen and yet
[4:21] there's hundreds of organized churches
[4:25] organized religion hundreds of different
[4:27] views and and ideas hundreds of churches
[4:31] seem like one on every corner and all
[4:36] claim to be right and this does not
[4:39] resemble the early church but what
[4:44] actually denomination does instead of
[4:46] making one body it causes division and
[4:49] causes great damage to the body of
[4:52] Christ because it it forms a set of
[4:56] doctrines and rules and regulations and
[4:59] then people become that by membership
[5:02] instead of my birth wave and Jesus said
[5:07] I am the vine and you are the branches
[5:09] so it's one vine but multiple branches
[5:12] and so if the church is a part of that
[5:15] one bond they should be putting forth
[5:17] the same branch that we've been speaking
[5:19] of in the book of Acts which is a true
[5:21] church bearing the same fruit bearing
[5:23] the same fruit well we find today's we
[5:25] got multiple branches or multiple vines
[5:27] and multiple branches yeah preserves
[5:30] offshoots every denomination well I
[5:32] think it's you know kind of parallel to
[5:35] lights an orange tree you can have a
[5:38] citrus tree and let's say it's original
[5:40] rootstock is orange and so it originally
[5:44] puts forth oranges that but then men
[5:46] come along and they graft on it other
[5:49] citrus varieties like lemon or
[5:53] grapefruit or or lime or some other
[5:56] varieties and now you have an orange
[5:59] tree that is not producing the oranges
[6:02] alone is producing all different kinds
[6:04] of varieties of citrus fruit and but if
[6:09] the tree the arms tree ever puts forth
[6:13] another branch it will write another
[6:16] book of Acts behind it it'll have the
[6:19] same fruits that the root
[6:21] had and I think this is it you know
[6:24] Jesus prayed a prayer and he said it
[6:27] prayed that we all might be one he said
[6:31] even father as I and the other one and
[6:34] so you know how was Jesus and the father
[6:37] one the the father that sent him came in
[6:40] here right and when we are truly one
[6:42] with God it's when Jesus comes into our
[6:46] life the Spirit of Jesus comes in us to
[6:49] do the same works that he does and and
[6:52] live the same type of life that he did
[6:54] and and that's where the new birth is so
[6:57] important if I'm if I'm birth of the
[6:59] same spirit that brother Craig's birth
[7:00] does then we'll both do the same works
[7:03] if we have the same fruit tree life like
[7:06] you spoke of in us if I put forth
[7:08] oranges and he puts forth grapefruits we
[7:11] don't have the same life within us which
[7:13] is when man began to substitute things
[7:17] like Creed's and church joining and just
[7:19] believing and things like that and
[7:21] substituted that for the new birth they
[7:23] did away with the commonality that Jesus
[7:26] was praying for that we would all be one
[7:27] we can't all be one if you go to a
[7:29] certain church that believes you just
[7:31] have to believe this doctrine but you go
[7:33] to a church that believes you just have
[7:35] to believe that doctrine automatically
[7:36] you've been separated
[7:38] you're not one and the commonality is
[7:40] they took away the genuine new birth
[7:43] that would make y'all have the same life
[7:45] and put forth the same fruits well you
[7:49] know they're trying to do that with a
[7:51] forced unity today you know with
[7:53] ecumenism and you know everybody lay
[7:56] down your differences and your different
[7:58] ideas or whatever and and you know
[8:01] everybody just you know love one another
[8:04] and must be the church to jesus said but
[8:07] really to be the church that jesus said
[8:10] we would have to come back to Bible
[8:12] teaching to Bible life to the life of
[8:14] Christ again and so it wouldn't be a
[8:17] forced unity like the Tower of Babel but
[8:20] it would be rather Christ in you the
[8:24] hope of glory living out of your life
[8:26] producing the same fruits that the life
[8:30] of Jesus did so the first the FIR
[8:33] Church when Jesus commanded or
[8:36] commissioned the church he said heal the
[8:38] sick raise the dead cast out devils and
[8:41] in the first church fulfilled that
[8:46] commission to the letter the very shadow
[8:48] of Peter healed the sick that was the
[8:51] emphasis that was the message of the
[8:53] church was to call them out of sin to to
[8:57] open the prison doors to heal the sick
[9:01] to proclaim the blood of Jesus Christ
[9:03] the good news how vastly different the
[9:07] message is today if the same life that
[9:10] was in Christ who healed the sick and
[9:12] raise the dead and cleanse the lepers
[9:13] was now in the church and they produced
[9:15] the same thing in the first church if
[9:17] we're the true church then we must
[9:19] produce what the first church produced
[9:22] then so we can judge by the pattern what
[9:25] is true and what is false so you know if
[9:29] he is the same then he would have the
[9:32] same attitude toward the sick the same
[9:34] attitude toward the loss the same
[9:37] attitude toward mercy and grace the same
[9:40] attitude toward his word man that that
[9:44] he had been because it would be the same
[9:45] Jesus his same attitude towards sin
[9:47] that's right same attitude towards sin
[9:50] absolutely so the denominations if Jesus
[9:54] his won't and his desire his prayer was
[9:57] that we'd be one and we see
[10:01] denominations that comes in and builds
[10:03] walls you know there's walls to keep
[10:05] their people to believe a certain thing
[10:06] we have to say denominations not of
[10:09] Christ as a man that's right yeah the
[10:13] very first thing that Pentecost achieved
[10:15] was it tore down the middle walls that
[10:17] separated and integrated it created a
[10:19] brotherhood his buddy and they had all
[10:21] things in common and they were one mind
[10:23] and one Accord the gospel that's right
[10:27] that's right
[10:27] build their own Kingdom when you find
[10:29] kingdom building and once again what you
[10:31] find is Babylon because it's a bunch of
[10:33] different voices causing confusion yeah
[10:35] and that's what you see and so we've
[10:37] changed the gospel today to prosperity
[10:40] or you know to
[10:43] feel good religion just easy believe ISM
[10:46] you know but when the Holy Spirit comes
[10:49] you really don't have to beg people to
[10:52] pray or beg them to worship God you
[10:55] don't are to do what's right they're
[10:57] just so in love with Jesus and I think
[11:00] that's the whole thing it's when the
[11:01] love of God the Holy Ghost comes in a
[11:04] person's life it produces a love for God
[11:07] a love for his work a love to go to
[11:10] church absolutely just love to go to
[11:13] church I love to worship God and nobody
[11:16] it's not a forceful religious act that's
[11:18] right exactly
[11:19] absolutely I think the scripture is very
[11:21] clear back to what we were talking about
[11:23] there about a unity and how denomination
[11:27] doesn't create that unity that unity can
[11:29] only come by the Holy Spirit and it says
[11:33] in the scriptures in 1st Corinthians 1
[11:35] in 10 it says now I beseech you brethren
[11:36] by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[11:38] that you all speak the same thing and
[11:42] that there be no divisions among you but
[11:44] that you be perfectly joined together in
[11:46] the same mind and in the same judgment
[11:49] and this is not possible under a system
[11:52] of man right only the Holy Ghost could
[11:54] it can't be legislated only the Holy
[11:57] Ghost
[11:57] that's absolutely and it wasn't the mind
[12:00] of Paul or the mind of Peter that's the
[12:02] same mind was the same Jesus it was a
[12:06] kingdom Beldon of some personality cult
[12:09] it was absolutely the mind of Christ
[12:13] came in to them and they were of the
[12:15] same mind this is why the Bible said in
[12:18] acts 1:14 and they continued all with
[12:20] one Accord in prayer and supplication
[12:23] now I just ask the question how did
[12:25] y'all get a bunch of juice together in
[12:28] one Accord yeah I mean a hundred and
[12:30] twenty people and you have a hundred and
[12:32] twenty different opinions but they had
[12:35] one thing in mind right one thing in
[12:37] mind and that was in Luke 24:49 behold I
[12:41] send the promise of my father upon you
[12:44] may but tell you in the city of
[12:47] Jerusalem until you're in dude with
[12:49] powerful
[12:49] and I think if that becomes the cry of
[12:52] the church gel in DUIs with that
[12:55] powerful huh because he said that's one
[12:57] innate you shall receive power after
[13:00] that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and
[13:03] so that's what really makes the true
[13:05] oneness and makes us one is when you
[13:09] receive the spirit obviously the spirit
[13:11] then we're one mine and and you know
[13:14] even though we still may have difference
[13:17] a little difference opinions and then
[13:18] our own individual personalities yet we
[13:23] all have one standard and that's the
[13:25] Word of God and it has the preeminence
[13:28] and each one of our lives and even when
[13:30] we have a different idea we have to say
[13:32] humble down to the Word of God this is
[13:34] what the word says and it begins to
[13:37] manifest itself out when we all have the
[13:39] same goal just like on the after the day
[13:42] of Pentecost they didn't go forward and
[13:44] sit down and discuss and say well what
[13:46] program can we implement to begin to get
[13:48] people to come in they went forth in
[13:50] power and demonstration because they
[13:52] were in one mind and one Accord to lift
[13:54] up the kingdom of God and to tear
[13:56] Satan's Kingdom down and that became
[13:58] their passion that became their focus
[14:00] and the works followed just as the word
[14:03] promised that it would j-man well that's
[14:05] that's what is so mysterious when when
[14:10] people view even our church and what God
[14:14] is doing among us and they see young
[14:16] people sitting on the front row they're
[14:18] not mandated they're not told to do that
[14:21] but there they are entered into worship
[14:23] and I don't mean one or two I mean you
[14:26] know 30 40 50 young people sitting there
[14:30] worshiping God little from from 11 12 15
[14:35] 18 25 year old people as well as adults
[14:39] and they're people that are on fire for
[14:42] God and worshiping God with all of their
[14:46] heart and dis amazes people but but
[14:49] because somehow they have lost the
[14:53] attraction right and they think
[14:55] entertainment some program so what
[14:58] program are you doing it well I just
[15:00] tell you what we're doing
[15:01] I'll let the world know our secret we're
[15:04] giving them all pills yeah and the pill
[15:07] were given is the gospel yes wouldn't
[15:10] get the gospel of Jesus Christ and the
[15:13] life of the blood in them yes oh it
[15:16] makes them love them love his word yeah
[15:19] we've had people ask us well we see your
[15:22] youth group that's so what what do you
[15:23] do to keep them and how we know young
[15:26] people don't even hardly come to our
[15:27] church anymore and and if they do is
[15:29] because mom or dad drug what are you
[15:31] doing special and what it is is like you
[15:33] said you're preaching the word and
[15:34] they're seeing it in power in
[15:36] demonstration is not just word and so it
[15:39] is it it still has its attraction yes
[15:42] because they see it's a Living God that
[15:44] there is a real God a real power and
[15:46] it's changed their lives modern thinking
[15:49] is that the young people won't respond
[15:53] to these ancient teachings and the Bible
[15:58] and the old traditional ways that the
[16:01] people just won't respond but that
[16:04] wasn't so with the first church the
[16:06] first church he said I write unto you
[16:08] father's because you have known him that
[16:10] is from the beginning I write unto you
[16:12] young men because you have overcome the
[16:14] wicked one I write unto you little
[16:16] children because you have known the
[16:18] father I have written unto you father's
[16:20] because you have known him that is from
[16:22] the beginning I've written unto you
[16:23] young men because you are strong and the
[16:25] Word of God abideth in you and you have
[16:28] overcome the wicked one amen so if that
[16:31] was in the first church we're sure
[16:33] seeing that today to love for the word I
[16:37] think the whole key of that is you know
[16:39] is that you're known you're known you're
[16:42] none of the fireman you you know God all
[16:46] of these things and I think that is the
[16:48] attraction it's coming to know the
[16:51] Living God in the power of his
[16:52] resurrection instead of you're trying to
[16:56] entertain these kids get them filled
[16:58] with the pain man amen because you know
[17:02] it's not to us just an ancient truth
[17:05] that God it's lifting him up out of
[17:09] history and bringing him in a present
[17:12] day showing that Jesus Christ is the
[17:15] same there's the word power there when
[17:17] it speaks so you shall receive power
[17:19] that word power is Dunamis yeah I love
[17:21] the definition says the power residing
[17:23] in a thing by virtue of its nature
[17:27] so the power that's residing in us by
[17:30] the virtue of the nature which is a
[17:31] nature of Christ well in the word
[17:33] Dunamis is where we get the word
[17:36] dynamite exactly this explosive wherever
[17:45] they go you know they're shaking the
[17:47] world example let's say they've been
[17:49] with Jesus Oh hallelujah that's what we
[17:51] want we could never receive the Holy
[17:53] Spirit without the word pattern because
[17:56] because the Bible said he gave the Holy
[17:59] Ghost to them that obey him right and
[18:01] that is God's provided pathway to
[18:05] receiving life
[18:06] it's his provided approach is his word
[18:09] yeah so it as we sum up this session
[18:13] today you know and acts 2:22 it would
[18:17] say ye men of Israel hear these words
[18:19] Jesus of Nazareth a man approved which
[18:23] means authenticated approved of God
[18:25] among you by miracles and wonders and
[18:29] signs which God did by him in the midst
[18:32] of you so if that was what the head
[18:35] would be wouldn't the body be the same
[18:37] Amen so of people that a church that is
[18:40] approved of God authenticated they moved
[18:44] of God by miracles by wonders and signs
[18:48] which God does in the midst of us alone
[18:52] as Jesus Christ is shown to the world to
[18:55] be the same yesterday today forever that
[18:58] God who still heals deliverance a made
[19:02] man amen and he not only saves but he
[19:04] keeps that's right as we see you're
[19:07] sealed unto the day of redemption yea
[19:09] into their bodies and James right amen
