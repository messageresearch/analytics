be a Christian today serving the lord together in the presence of the great king of glory let him move in your life today amen we sang this song a while ago his goodness is running after you the psalmist David said in Psalms 23 is very familiar but it ends up with saying surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life think about that and looking up that word one time I looked it up and I said follow after what is that mean means to chase Mercy is on your Trail goodness is going to overtake you the grace of God is going to overreach all the situations that's been in your life amen God moving in your life touching Hearts may he touch your life today maybe you got somebody on your heart today that you want to just remember in prayer maybe a soul that needs touching maybe it's a mother a wife maybe it's a a husband a brother sister whatever it is Jesus knows I believe today that as we speak as we pray today we can put the Holy Spirit on their Trail amen we we know the enemy is there to come and destroy he's a thief he comes to Rob kill and destroy but we have one today that is coming to give life and life more abundantly I believe in that Abundant Life Today overflowing goodness and mercy father in the name of Jesus as every heart Lord reaches out to you as today we move out of this building and move into the Realms oh God where angels are present where the Holy Spirit predominates to where it's only perfect love and there before the throne of grace we come and we come to find help in our time of need and Lord we find oursel needy today certainly not like Leo deia who says I have need of nothing but God we're [Music] cognant we're cognant of our need we realize Lord that there's situations we can't solve mountains we can't move troubles that we can't overcome but Lord we're not depending on our Humanity this morning therefore we are not approaching your throne of grace as humans but as sons of God welcomed into the presence of God because we're your Offspring and it is there we present our need there's our need our need a mountain needs moving Lord I think of a mountain today our sister Nancy that needs a touch from you today her husband brother Tom here in the church but Lord she needs a touch Lord I pray you'll go to that room where she is May the Holy Spirit just sweep down heart trouble is no problem for our God he's the one who said I'll give you a new heart and a new spirit and I'll place my spirit in you and Lord that's the supernatural birth but Lord if you can do that far supernaturally you can also heal the physical there are others Lord that are here and their request is no doubt very worthy and maybe it's for a lost loved one a prodal that's out there Lord May somehow you reach out to them Lord knock on their door I I pray Lord that you'll speak to their hearts may we realize oh God we're here in the last closing hours and the last ones the last ones must come in we cannot leave without them Lord we will not leave a hoof behind we're going in and all of our loved ones with us we're claiming those Lord no matter how deep and they've been in sin how awful the tragedy of sin in their life that you oh God who rescues the perishing that you will throw out a Lifeline to them today knock at their door one more time deal with their heart in a way that they can't resist for we remember Lord when you came to us and with that in irresistible love we yielded and we pray that you will do the same for them Lord I pray father for your servant brother Ron not able to have church today there in Virginia I pray that you'll gather with them today in a special way each one of them Lord that are tuning in today to this service I pray the one who is the strength Giver the El shadai will give strength to our brother today and may oh God he remember that this gospel brings benefits and with those benefits is the Lord to he heals all diseases oh God and not only that but he renews the strength so that our youth is renewed like the eagle I pray oh God that in our patience we possess our souls and we wait on you today as we look to the word now I pray that you'll vindicate it today with your presence that it will not just be words that are spoke but the power of the Holy Spirit Will go forth in Deliverance I ask it in your name feeling your anointing knowing you said whatever we ask in your name you would do it so we speak to Every Mountain of sin and unbelief every demon power that would try to oppose and we resist it in the name of Jesus and we claim the promise for every believer right now in jesus' name amen and amen why don't we just lift our hands and worship God and thank him right now thank him right now thank you Lord in advance that our prayers have been answered that we have been heard and the answer is on the way Lord that you're knocking at hearts and lives right now you're dealing with Souls as only you can you're speaking to them in ways we could not you're knocking on hearts and dealing with lives you're healing bodies right now Lord the Holy Spirit going forth right now healing bodies Lord we know of your power of your Resurrection ction and we ask that it'll work among us today as only you can do in Jesus name amen and amen amen God bless you God bless you thank you for being here today let's turn to the word of God as we look to the word there's many things that are laying here in the scripture and sometimes we just can't no way get to them allall and even sometimes even complete full thought so we're going to actually pick on up on what I preached on last Sunday some more things that I want to speak from there as I speak of the living bride the final Stones amen and to if you'll turn with me to Ephesians 5 we'll read from verse 25 and while you're reading from there I want you to remember our theme on the mountain movers of who art thou oh great Mountain Thou shalt become a plain and The Headstone shall be brought forth with shoutings crying Grace Grace to it so Ephesians chap 5 and verse 25 I wanted to show you um a mountain and if we'll look here in this verse it says husband loves your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word verse 27 that he might present it to himself and here's the mountain a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it that it should be holy and without blemish and then last Sunday I showed you another Capstone which we know that Jesus has been building a church for Seven Ages and the majority of that church has already been made up they're resting as part of that building they're described in the Bible as the dead in Christ and yet without us they're not finished they're not complete so there is yet to be the finishing Stone of people alive and remain and she will be the Capstone Church of the ages who will perfectly match Christ who's the head of all and so 1 Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord L amen God bless you you can be seated the Capstone that we are speaking about today of course um it represents that final piece that brings the structure together and in in a large picture of it it signifies Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of God's great plan but let us not think think of Jesus as only in the masculine form because his bride is Miss Jesus and will be the ultimate fulfillment of all the scriptures that spoke of her and we ask of ourselves this morning how will he do this you know this is an insurmountable Mountain to have to have as he said a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but holy and without blemish how is this even possible we we know ourselves in the frailness of our own humanity and we we know that this is a DA daunting task because even the church has struggled with imperfections for two millenniums and where she was defiled with false doctrines and with Creeds of men and I know to bring forth this bride to perfection it will be with great shoutings of Grace Grace it certainly will be the favor of God but not only that but through the Dark Ages that we know this church has had its struggles it has went to down to the ground like a seed and it decayed and it rotted as it were and yes it died and just as there was the death of Christ on a Roman Tree so did his bride the church die on Roman Tree as brother Brandon would bring this out in restoration of the Bride tree he said the Roman caterpillar started eating on that bride tree until it took it Plum to the roots and the same Roman Tree what kind of tree did did did cut down did did cut Christ down and the congregation says Roman what kind of tree that cut Christ bride down Roman how by substituting something besides the word so it has been for the past ages that she has been sealed and intuned with the Creeds of man a Roman seal um of Trinity of of the worship of Mary of all myriads of man's Traditions has sealed her in the in the tombs of religion and Satan is is is like the Romans were they were going to make sure that Jesus did not raise from the dead and that his body would never leave the tomb and so Satan has done the same thing down to the ages he's he sealed her behind the doors of Creeds and dogmas and trying to bring and put put Roman seals upon her to try to hold her back and so for the to bring forth the bride age or bride time there has to be a resurrection so that even as there was a resurrection of the groom so there must be a resurrection of the Bride out of the tombs of religion for did not Jesus say of them in Matthew 23: 27 you're like white wash tombs painted white in other words you're like a burial Vault you're like a A melum or um a beautiful tomb that looks beautiful on the outside but on the inside what do you find inside that tomb you find um full of dead men's bones and everything unclean and of course this is the the the state that he found the religious system in in his day and this is the status of the religious systems of today tombs of man that have that has tried to hold the bride back keep her dead keep her in sins and trespass passes and unbelief and sealing her ER behind um behind Roman seals so we needed a resurrection and maybe you were in a tomb where sealed with Roman seals of the Creeds of man of rituals religious edicts and and decrees and and you can name it dis denominational tomb or have any kind of name on the tomb but you see Satan was going to make sure you stay dead sealed in a religious tomb but as brother bradam preached and it is the rising of the sun he says for the bright age for there for the first time there's should be a resurrection out of dark denominationalism and to do that will be a message that the full full maturity of the word is turned back again in full power amen bringing being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because I live you shall live also speaking to his wife because I live you shall live also what a resurrection that was 2,000 years ago and what a resurrection this is to be Quicken from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power but not only was the church that way you were that way amen you were that way if you if you look in Ephesians chapter 2 you will see you were dead in sins and trespasses amen and and when and you walked and you walked when you the way you used to walk when you conformed to the ways of the world to the ruler of the power of the air the spirit that is now working in the children of Disobedience and all of us live that way at one time indulging in his Desires in his thoughts and like the rest of us because of our first birth we were children of Wrath as others amen but because of his great love for us God who is rich in Mercy amen when we were dead in our s sins and trespasses amen he hath made us alive amen for it is by Grace you are saved and God has raised us up with him given you a resurrection and seated us with him in Heavenly places in position and Authority in Heavenly dominions how wonderful that is how glorious oh my dead and sins and trespasses Bound by sin's chains like the woman at the well Satan has put chains of adultery upon her and then religious chains of the Samaritan religion sealed in that that tomb until Jesus had a need to pass by her way amen and the say and that saved Jesus as I look upon this crowd this morning I can see ones one here one there many here many there that Jesus had a need to pass by your way amen and he found you in that same condition sealed in kept down deprived pushed back dead in your sins and trespasses he but down on the inside was a predestinated seed and the same God that said in the beginning let there be light and there was light that same God sent his light to Dawn down in the darkness and that seed came forth never to be never to go back again I said never to go back again that's us as brother Bradman went on to say in that it is rising of the sun that's what he proved Hallelujah that's what Easter proved he was not only the word but he was God himself the Dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus Christ cold dead and stiff in the grave shake to life again and rise again and roll away the stone I am he that was dead so dead took the sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the Stars said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again and he was not only the mechanics God's word but he was the Dynamics to prove it and as she be in the groom the bride has to come forth because it's a part of him and it can only be the manifestations of the fulfilling of all the revelations of any other that spoke with the bride he can only manifest now that was a mouthful somebody just give you I'm just going to bring it back to you again this bride can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others throughout the Bible spoke of the Bride it can only manifest and that word manifest means make clear and obvious what was once obscure scripture now Paul spoke of this he spoke of a bride so here I'm going to give you just you know this again bring this to your Forefront of your thinking Paul spoke of a bride that would be the manifestation of the Fulfillment of this Revelation that he had when he spoke and said that Christ would present himself a glorious Church Without spot wrinkle or blemish so the end time church is a manifestation in other words she is to make clear and obvious amen the very Revelation that Paul prophesied of being she will be the embodiment of that scripture amen a bride a church without spot or without wrinkle or without a blemish and you're asking yourself how am I going to do this well it won't be by Man's power it won't be by man's might but by my spirit sayith the lord it's going to take the Holy Ghost hallelujah it's going to take quickening power and now and now amen you see she will be alive I'm I'm showing you again the scripture she will be the embodiment of the scripture she will be alive and remain at the coming of the Lord amen so she will not be just barely surviving amen but she will be rising as he did and he didn't rise defeated but he rose a champion and I'm telling you this bride is not going to rise a defeated people but she's going to rise a champion a champion over sin over Darkness over hell itself an overcomer in this age now Jesus spoke of the Bride himself so now here's another Revelation or or a fulfillment of scripture that must be fulfilled for he spoke and he says that my church will be built on the revelation of who I am and he said the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against her no tomb of religion will hold her down and no nothing nothing no seal no no chains that the devil will try to put on you is going to hold you back Hallelujah because the resurrected Christ in your life will burst through the chains of every darkness of every sin of all unbelief oh how much time could we spend on the scripture and we have who have spoke uh the scriptures that has spoke and prophesying of a bride we can speak about Abraham and Sarah the prophecy of Alazar are going to go get a bride for Isaac we can speak of Israel um getting married to God when they made the Covenant at Mount Si we could talk about the entire book of The Song of Solomon that has that speaks of the love affair between God and His elect lady we can speak about Ruth and Esther and on and on and on we could go because this bride this end time bride is the Fulfillment of all the scriptures that spoke of the Bride so even as Jesus was the Fulfillment of all the Old Testament amen even now his bride is a fulf fillment of the entire word of God Amen now so as we look at this he says if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride so go back and see what Jesus did see what his attitude toward the sick was see what come on see if he had prayer lines see if he didn't lay hands on the sick see if he didn't cast out Devils come on see see if he see if he didn't tell us to speak with new tongues see if he didn't tell us come on see what he did amen what about those who were were chained like the woman at the well that wasn't a physical sickness that was a spiritual sickness but she found Deliverance so the bride will have the same attitude even toward the Lost even toward prodal that God has because as we wrap up the the New Testament in in the Book of Revelation it tells you of the spirit and the bride speaking in unison not independently not her with her own message and him with another but hear them both speaking together and the spirit and the bride say come not us for no more hallelujah amen oh yes so if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride amen I I hear the prophet pray and he prays like this and and I and this is as he would start out the meetings for the the church a series that he would preach and here would be his prayer and I think it ought to be our prayer for 2025 he said May during this meeting it cause men and women to take a hold newly or new hold so may you raise up speakers with tongues interpretation interpreters of tongues may you ra raise up gifts of Prophecy raise up preachers and pastors evangelists and so forth that the church might be edified raise missionaries to go into the field Yonder and bring forth with this glorious Gospel wherever the word shall go may it fall into good ground bringing forth a h hundredfold for we believe where at the End of the Age the consummation is near amen I Wonder Could That Be The Prayer of evening light Tabernacle amen for this service this morning amen again and hear you himm I I shared this the other night with W with our our our uh the group that was gathered and I and I spoke about this very this very quote and father God I can hear the scream of the lamb at Calvary and it makes me seek and Hunger and thirst that's what it ought to do to us I wonder if we can if we can just have a renewing of Calvary in our lives this morning until it makes us seek and Hunger and thirst oh I see his little children dying Satan has got them bound up some of them are sick and Afflicted oh God and that cry that cry of a sinful world that cry of people that's been caught up by the devil who wants to be liberated and they're screaming for Mercy Oh My Stop a moment I think about I think about for a moment my mind goes to the maniac of G at and there he was there way across the sea Jesus was busy with with thousands around him and minister to them and feeding 5000s and on and on and on and all and and he he gets out into a boat and he goes to go across the sea and he goes to leave all of these and why because there's one there's one oh he's a worthless individual he's been in trouble with the law amen he's been in Chains and darkness he's been in tombs he's hurt so bad he's cut himself he hates who he is and he can't do anything about it and he's out of his mind I'll tell you there's many degrees to that and if you're not a child of God this morning you're not surrendered to Christ you're out of your mind there is a peace that surpasses all understanding and you don't have to stay in that condition when there is a savior but he must have woke up just for a moment come to himself just a moment as those Legions of devils took a hold of him and had him bound but just for a moment his lips became free enough just to say a little prayer maybe it was just a whisper Jes God God help me and from there he slips back into his Insanity demon possession driven in tombs nobody wanted him rejected couldn't live at home no more beat up the family ruined lives and wrecked a Despicable horrible individual but a seed of God hidden down in there was a seat of God that was that was crying for manifestation come your just for a moment to say God help me goes right back in and with that Jesus gets in a boat because God was right there oh I wish he was had close to me this morning I wish he would could get a boat and come to me he's closer than that he's right here in the form of his holy spirit amen physically there he was there in Jesus Christ and would have to go over boat and and then Satan seeing him was coming he would stay cause storms to come up and everything else to try to destroy him where he could never get across but Jesus goes on speaks peace to the storms where the thousands of devils are going to try to destroy him and now he comes to meet the thousands of devils that are in this man and he walks out and puts his foot out there and this man comes to meet him with every intentions of destroying him but let me tell you once in the presence of Jesus chains break Darkness fleas demons leave Hallelujah I've seen it happen I've seen men and women same condition lost and Si and hopeless and a god rich in Mercy could buy their way and break the chains of Darkness off their lives cuz he's that kind of a god he's coming looking for you cuz he heard your cry Satan's got them all bound up some of them are sick and Afflicted oh God that c that cry of a sinful world that cry of people that's been caught up by the devil who wants to be liberated I don't want to live this way I don't want to be this way I can't help myself I've destroyed my home I've destroyed my family I've destroyed lives I've wounded others I made churches reject me they didn't want me they pushed me out I I I because of not because they were evil because you were evil because of what you did because of your behavior but they're caught up screaming now for mercy and he says oh God send preachers from this meeting send missionaries from here send them from this convention Lord to go out to to with a new vision into the fields to win souls may they go with such Gallant heroism and the high blood of Christ beating through their veins as it was that's been changed by the great miracle of the new birth and send them as real heroes of the Cross may they preach like never before amen I tell you that's way I want to be this year I preached for 55 years since I was a young boy of 15 but I want to preach this year like I've never preach I want to Harald the gospel like I've never Harald it I want to cast Satan out whatever word that I preach I want to see victory in the house of God I want to see the glory of God come into the temple I want to see the Holy Ghost move out in power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost because he's the only thing that can liberate he's the only thing one that can set free all of our man's psychology all our man's efforts har All laws and rules and regulations won't do it the only thing that'll do it is Christ he said May mothers be real mothers God how many mothers could say let me be that Lord may they dismiss the babysitter and get get away keep away from the barroom and throw down those cigarettes and dress like a mother ought to and be a real mother when they hear the cries of the juvenile delinquency everywhere and all the see all this distress May dads be real dads Lord my oh God keep them from the barroom in the pool hall and let them lay down those carnal things and step out with the weapons of the Holy Ghost today and fight as never before and bless those who raised their hands bless those who had convictions who did not raise their hands hands altto together Lord give us of thy blessings and make this one of the greatest conventions that has been here yet because we ask it in Christ's name I believe God will answer that prayer I believe if we'll pray it this morning God will answer it here condemnation R representation brother brandham begins praise and he says granted father heal all the sick and afflicted bring back to the oldfashioned Revival type of people again amen bring them back to original Pentecost bring them back to the the blessings bring them back like Pentecost fell at ad33 give them the Pentecostal blessings May the power of God come into the church May there be Divine Healing gifts give to the church May there be speakers with tongues interpreters of tongues May there be Gifts of Prophecy and all different manifestation not make believe or try to believe and put on but may it be real genuine coming with the word the word of God made known prophesying things that come to pass how many can say Amen this of course the return to the original Pentecost couldn't even happen till Malachi 4 came and now instead of repeating the cycle of Revival and death we ought to be in the place this morning of resurrection of even raising the dead listen here is the high bar that is set in God of this evil age is one of the last things that was imparted To Us by the seventh angel Messenger as he was winding down the last year of his life and the last few sermons that he would preach and this is about the one the last sermons that he would preach to his Tabernacle and he said now she has caus the whole world to accept the scientific leadership of the educational program that Satan has given her under the name of the of a church the leadership of an educational scientific program I'm picturing to you the God of this world when she as Eve had the very feeling of God's word in her hand and she could have t took God's word but what did she do to that instead of taring for the baptism of the Holy Ghost let science prove to her that the Holy Ghost was only for the disciples and instead of keeping Divine Healing going when she ought to be now raising the dead and doing great Miracles she has led Satan under the leadership of religious men try or take the word of God and try to say it was for another age and she's believed it and when the Bible said the things I do say you do also Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and we're still creatures and what he's trying to tell us this is still in effect and these signs shall follow every one of them that believes she denies every bit of it she denies all the Supernatural and she is swapped it for his intellectual con deception of the Bible where priests and holy fathers are so-called and Bishops and Archbishop and District where district prors and general overseers and so forth have put their own interpretation to it and God has Let Them Sit their dead is 12:00 the only things left in this last day I'm continue reading is a bunch of little Pentecostals with a bunch of music whooped up as hard as he can running up and down the aisles speaking in tongues and shouting and having a form of godliness but denying the word thereof and I want to say that's not us we are not word deniers tell them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ laugh in your face that's not us we are wor word Believers but that but God goes right on making it so just the same proven his word to be so now in the message spoken words Original Seed is a great series if you've never listened to it or read it you know you should and in that great message he would go and look back at his ministry and he said the word has now been sown he said we have actually got several crops that have been planted the Baptist under the head planner of Billy Graham has planted um his easy believism and they and they are now going to reap a harvest of that and he said all Roberts on the other hand would the Pentecostals have have went in their faith and prosperity movement and they have sowed the seeds for that and that's what they will produce but he says the word has also been sown and it will produce a crop so he saw his ministry as the sewing rain he emphatically denied that isusa street was the latter rain or the final outpouring of the spirit no indeed she was not the grain she was not the one to head up the wheat plant remember the Capstone for the wheat plant would be the grain it would be the head so when the grain comes to the head or the wheat comes the head it's the grain right so it's the cap Stone of the plant that's what we're talking about a word bride exactly like the seed that was planted so you see the she was but ausa Street was not the grain she was not the one to head up the wheat plant for it grows from seed to the head of grain and and because as he explained in the church ages he said this age just um started just after the turn of the 20th century and it was be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost now I want you to know that's still God's aim that's still God's plan for the bride to return to be in the church true church to return to be in the bride she was at Pentecost he said we know that there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power so to do that Dynamic power has to come with the word she has received are you with me now so he said the Believers sense this in this 1906 as they was sense this in their spirits and they begin to cry to God for new outpouring such as was in the first century and what seemed to be the answer notice this what seemed to be the answer not what was the answer but it seemed it was the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit and it was then believed that this indeed was the long awaited restoration and that's what they preach we are the restoration we are the book of Acts church it's it's returned again that's what they believe that's what they preach but as brother brandham said it was not for the latter Reign can only come after the former reign rain which is the spring or teaching rain so the latter rain then is the Harvest rain so how could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come the prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the Rapture had not come and it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessing and manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we kept pointing out to you and it was also devil power as men were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it and then to prove it was not the real these people even before second generation had appeared or organized and wrote their unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences as every other group ahead of them did now but let me talk about this this bride's Revival is the latter rain and it has been sewn with the word and let me just say for 60 years now we have since we receiving the message we have we have been laying word up on top of word we have been sewing the seeds for Revival Hallelujah now it is it's it is let me just say emphatically it is the long awaited restoration where the true church returns to being the bride she was at Pentecost so we know then that there must be a necessity a return of dynamic power because this bride cannot leave as a word only bride it will take the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost to lift her up out of here in the glory now so as we look at this for a moment I want to just share with with you another quotation this is from a message perseverance and he says you know when Jesus preached there wasn't 1% of one millionth of the people of the Earth ever heard of him look what John heard look what heard John to make preparation see it's the elected that hears it well if this was true everybody would believe it no it isn't so right it didn't happen in jesus' day it won't happen in this day in fact it's absolutely the opposite I can show you in the scripture that all will wonder after the Beast and His Image so the whole world will never believe it and the majority will never receive it and it'll be only a minority that will ever receive it you said well you got a big church we are a minority first of all I mean I'll tell you again we're an endangered species Satan would snuff us out he could amen if he could do it he would that's what I meant to say now so he says he says only the elected that hears it and he said that's right no man can come to me except my father draws him first and all the father has given me will come that's right now I believe there's a church coming into that Perfection that Ministry of perfection where the offices where Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists for the Perfection of the church them pastors and teachers and so forth will be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the Lord I believe that and I believe we're in that time now Hallelujah and that's what we have done for 60 years we we have been seed sers tell me what the ministry of the son of man was he said the he showed the parable of the ser and he said the the son of man is the Ser the Ser in white is the son of man amen so it's Christ how's he doing it through his Five Fingers of a fivefold Ministry SE in the word now that's what's been done for 60 years we've swn the seed with the messenger to bring forth a crop a pure word in this harvest season so I'm going to just tell you the if if Pentecost ausa Street was not the real the real must come come on now if she and the prophet tells us she was not the real so the real must come she's prophesied of in all the scripture now watch it is the rising of the sun brother brandham confirms this he says there has been churches churches Brides brides churches Brides brides but there's got to come one Hallelujah there has to come a real bride there must come one listen now that's not only got the mechanics that's the word but the Dynamics of it and makes that church live but move on in the power of the resurrection and until we come to that place he says what good does it do to polish the hubs now he's talking about two c s that are set out and both of them are off the similar line one's got fire one of them doesn't both of them are filled up with gasoline and he said what does it good do to shine it up make it all pretty and everything else and it won't run that's what I've said if it won't run down to Divine Healing what good is it if it won't run down to the baptism of the Holy Ghost for people get a real experience with God and a life change what good is it you're just you know it might be a pretty building it might be plush pews though we might have fine worship we might have good singing we might have everything but what good is it to just polish the hubs what do good does it do to give her a facelift or a simonized job now that's going to take you back a few years what in the world's a simonized job well it was a product where they took and it had a little fine Grid in it it and it would you know it would get rid of the uh the glaze that was on the car and bring out the shine amen so he said what what good does it do to give it a s s simonized job or or polish it up when there is no Dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there has to be a Dynamics to make it work that's why I say she's going to be a living bride not a dead church and now watch now until that church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved him to do the things he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride and he said but he said in in John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works I do shall I he do also I'll give him a charge of my Dynamics in his mechan PCS and the world will not be able to withstand it and I'll raise him up again at the last day that's the Easter message I'm going to tell you this morning that's the resurrection message amen what is it the Dynamics and mechanics together the mechanics without Dynamics no good right I don't care how much you know the Bible how much you explain the seals how much you know the mystery how how much all of you you can get it and line it up all you without it no good amen neither is the Dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to and deny this word it won't do any good so while brother Tim sound like y'all you know you scream and you shout we're not word deniers not a word amen we are not word deniers but those who are Scream and Shout and jump up and down all the while denying the word he said you're just cranking on the Pistons got the got the spark there to fly but no gasoline to fire it by it'll only work as they come together amen so one will sit still and the other will go up I tell you I don't want to be the car sitting still I want to be the one going up amen listen now when the Dynamics came that fire was made to connect w w with that Octane and the gasoline and and when that explodes it causes combustion and that combustion moves every motion every move for he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's the real power of God mechanics with the Dynamics notice it's not it's the spirit that quickens it's the spark that fires it's not the gas that fires it's the spark heart that fires the gas you can do nothing without me but with me you do can do all things as he is the word it's the father living father sent me so send I you and the father that fired me and pushed me into everything I only do that which is pleas unto God now as he sent me so send I you with the same mechanics and it takes the same Dynamics to operate it and these signs shall follow them that claim to hi the mechanics the Dynamics will take place so if we got the real word we're going to have Dynamics with it amen oh brother Tim you know you're blasting us you're you're saying this listen I'm not denying you got it I'm just saying we want more of it amen amen I'd like to take a drive through the word of God this morning I'd like to take a tour through his promises I'd like to as I drive by I'd like to get me a good old glass of of Holy Ghost wine Hallelujah that changes my eyesight my thoughts focuses me only on Christ because this and don't confuse your focus it Focus you right on Jesus come on church amen I'd like to see a church drive right down to Healing Amen to miracles to see him prodical come home Devils cast out amen I'd like to see the Holy Ghost move in his power that's what we want to see a church with the mechanics and the Dynamics [Music] together in this last day church he will cap it off expressing himself in the fullness of in the fullness of God in Bride form listen Christ is a mystery and there would come a time when he would Express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church have preeminence that means the oversight the leadership in his church be the main one oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by why accepting what Eve turned out here's what we are anointed by by accepting what Eve turned down and coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit and Anointed with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept so we look all the way back to the fall in Genesis and look now at the finishing stone at the end what Eve turned down amen we come back he he comes back and we accept Hallelujah now what did Eve turn down that God would keep his word come on she allowed the serpent to put a question on God's word and we accept it by having no question no longer questioning God's word we're not to put a question on God's word huh this Mountain's too big my child's got too many problems this sickness is too great this problem is too hard this trial I can't ever overcome I'll never Rise Above This what are you doing you're limiting God you're putting a question on his word don't put a question on God's word even today Satan will constantly put a question on God's word to bind the Holy Spirit these are chains to keep you in tuned Amen to keep the Holy Spirit from moving that's what brother bam said he said the the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denomination in these denominational Rivers at the doors of Creeds and dogmas for 2,000 years and it's going to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message all right so if it's healing he will whisper days of prayer lines are over you can't major on a minor now that's true come on even some of the what serpent said was true yeah as God said when he comes to Jesus he quotes the word a mount of of Temptation right in the wilderness and he uses scripture right against against Christ so he'll come right along and he will as brother randam said not coat the word quote the word but coat the word and he'll just twist it he'll turn it take the very words of God and turn it you know I've seen people have a spirit right there on their ear that you say something to them you could actually compliment them and they we twisted turn it into something bad they can sit right in a church hear the word preach and he'll twist it and the only thing we'll do will add to their complex and here Satan will come he'll whisper things like you can't major on a minor and we can't but if we had the major we can have the minor the major is the Salvation of the Soul but if God can save a soul he can sure save a body can he it's the earnest of our inheritance so it's you know he'll come and Whisper ah the Mind healing it it ain't nothing but fish bait anyhow oh it's a lot more than fish bait it's the very nature of God come on Amen if it's gifts he will whisper oh we got the perfect word so we don't don't need them because it's only babies that want that you know the immature are are more dignified than that it shows you immature to desire spiritual gifts yet Paul said to follow after charity which is perfection and desire spiritual gifts but he said rather that you may prophesy and he said so you know here again you know he will come and he will twist the word if it's tongues he will misqu quot the word to mock it saying well jumping up and down and speaking like a kid or jumping up and down like a kid and and speaking in tongues is over that's not true that's a lie jumping and down like a kid to try to speak with tongues is over amen we should not try to manufacture it we should not try to work it up that is childish things and we're more grown up than that we know better than that but speaking in tongues is not over it's always to be in the church it's one of the signs that follows them that believe brother bradam sums up his Easter resurrection message to his church in Jeffersonville with this prayer and I want you to hear this is this is his last Easter message his he said this is my Easter message my resurrection message and he declares it is the rising of the sun the Sun Ain't setting on us come on somebody Sun is setting on civilization Sun is setting on on this world the Sun is setting on man's day but it ain't the setting of the Sun for us it is the rising of the sun Hallelujah and he says arise and shine and let thy light be showing out to the the world Amen for thy light has come so here he prays May then father if they're sick may they walk out well may if they're crippled may they walk out under the power of the Holy Ghost if they've been Sinners may they walk out washed and clean and the mechanics by going in and the Dynamics from above the Holy Spirit and catch them away Lord Quicken their mortal bodies and then we shall hear genuine new tones powers of God love Untold dying Grace and living grace and a resurrected Christ a body a bride representing him on the earth amen now of course if it's anointed preaching Satan Will shout shut up just play a tape cuz the only way to hear the voice of God oh yeah oh he gets loud he's got his voice going out but listen that ain't what the prophet taught he said now God could have chose to preach the gospel by the Sun by the Moon by the Stars by the wind or by nature but he chose men to preach the gospel and that's where the voice of God will come from men preaching the gospel that's where God's voice will come from and he tells us again in the pma's vision he speaks of the son of man which we know is Christ that has and he and he described in Revelation 1 as having a voice of many Waters and he says quotes there from from Revelation 7 15 to tell us what does Waters represent and he said the the waters which thou sawest is thickness and multitudes and peoples and tongues so we know that it's the voice of many Waters or the voice of many people come on the voice of many Waters what is his voice he said it's the Judgment he said it's the voice of the ministers through the holy spirit that has cried out to the people in every age standing there the voice of many Waters Cried Out thickness and multitude the voice of those seven stars in his hands to every Church age preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism in Jesus name speaking in tongues the power of God the resurrection of Christ the second coming Divine judgment the voice of many Waters coming from this one that looked like the son of man there again the son of man has a voice and remember where brother bradam said the son of man is being revealed he said he's being revealed in the bride body amen so again the voice of the many Waters and he said that voice is screaming out to you even this morning am mean like like a soul going down the stream and you're you're just like s daic gold enjoying the day in the Beautiful sunshine and not knowing that the laying ahead is cataracts not knowing laying ahead is his great waterfalls what a horrible thing he said for a drifting Soul on the sea of life no pilot to guide him loose and floating with the tides to hear the Roar of the great cataracts The Falls what a horrible thing it would be to a drifting soul and then knowing that you refuse to hear your voice his voice that is coming out of many Waters sermon after sermon witness after witness amen I tell you what I I hope you don't go to the Judgment because you go to the Judgment my voice and the voice of many will scream out and you'll have no excuse well they did this to me and they did that and I was wounded and I was hurt by The Watchmen and whatever else because you know I I was I was really just looking for God but you know I got hurt and I got wounded and I just gave up on religion I gave up on God I throw it away the message I threw away everything I don't care nothing about it but the voice I don't care what your pastor's been I don't care what situation been I don't care what others have done to you I don't care what Satan has throwed in your way it doesn't matter you must hear that voice where a voice of many Waters saying don't keep going down there you'll never make it in that canoe of life you're in you better call for The Old Ship isign to come out and rescue you this morning God's in the rescue business but he can't rescue anybody who won't take a hold of the lifeline and who knows when it throwed out to you for the last time so Satan tries to hush the voice of God to try to stop the preaching of the gospel and of course if it's a genuine experience with God Satan will tell you believe in the message is enough you see these are all whisperings of the serpent where he put a question on God's word well just how did that work out for Eve just how did that work out some of you have left the message you've left the word you've left Christ how did that work out for you it's not too good you go out there in a life of sin and it pays its wages they're harsh wages it's slavery and bondage and you think you you just thought it was bondage not to wear makeup or cut your hair wear something sexy and you're in the bondage of alcohol and tobacco and sin you can't say a word without filthiness coming out of your mouth you just thought this was bondage it is a yoke because it's a marriage and it's a love it's a love life that binds you by your life to Christ and you and him are one and you love him with all of your heart with all of your soul and you don't live in this gospel because you don't want to go to hell you live it because you love him with all your heart and you want to please him and you want to serve him so how did that work out for Eve It produced hybrid offspring I just believe the message and you have the Holy Ghost that's why we have frustrated kids who are commanded to do right in given rules they can't keep because they have no power to overcome that's why we have churches Today l this like an old hen who has not been with the mate and she can sit on those eggs and fuss over them and turn this this way and scold them here and give them lectures there and tell them how to do right there and those turn been around here you've sat that way too long you're here you're there you know not this way that way and sit on them and move them around sitting on her eggs try to turn them with psychology oh you shouldn't be doing that you know it's I hear you I I can I can tell you this contaminating you you got to have life in you so turn over here we'll give you some psychology to turn you this way where you where you where you get out of your your your pornography and you quit your adultery and and we'll give you something to you know to self-help kind of program and and and give you a lecture you know what go try to do better just try to be better until we have a nestful of rotten eggs and the church becomes as spoken in the Bible a cage a cage a hold of every unclean and hateful bird that's how it works out cuz you listen to a lot just believe the message and you got it it's a Whisper Of Satan you don't have to have that oldfashioned birth where you come down to a real repentance and a real turning to God and a turning away from sin well you say well brother Tim you're trying to preach some fantastic experience and some fantastic sensation that's not what we're doing at all and man we we want you to look even even today you say well brother Tim what what is the evidence how do I know that have the Holy Ghost look at your life look what you were you say well you know it was that moment brother Tim might have been in an altar it might have been in your seat I don't know where it was but it could have been in a closet somewhere but that moment that you turned to God and yielded yourself completely and totally to him and you were changed I don't remember the day I don't remember the very hour I I it wasn't wrote on my calendar you don't have to know all of that just know amen just know just look at yourself and look where you come from and look what he did for you and look how he changed you and look what your desires are and well look what the longing in your soul is and you know something happened to me amen I couldn't do it by myself I couldn't lay that down by myself but he came he changed me I don't care what formor it comes in I don't care if you speak in tongues or have you Clow in tongues I don't care if you roll on the floor or you run down the I don't care if you sit in your in your chair and they're just moved on by the spirit till you can't speak I don't care which way it comes as long as it comes Hallelujah but when he comes you'll never be the same again you'll be resurrected out of death into life never to go back into sin anymore hallelujah hallelujah amen that's the God we serve that's the God we're declaring this morning that's the God who said I am he that is the same yesterday today and forever the Living God and what are we doing we are accepting what he turned down eternal [Applause] life eternal life brother Ram says in God's word calls for total separation now the first Adam that was born the world or not born but created by God the first Adam separated himself from the word to his wife now he could have stayed with the word if he'd wished to but he separated himself from the word to be with his wife actually in doing so he was prophesying of Christ because he too became sin that you might become his righteousness and when Eve sinned and was and he saw what had happened he quickly took her to himself and together they were sent out of the garden that's right but even then you you see God wouldn't send his children out alone he says I'm coming with you because I will come as a seed that will bruise the head of the serpent hallelujah amen and I tell you what every child born of him is also a serpent Bruiser and a devil defeater Hallelujah that's the kind of God that we're serving one that would tread on the head of the serpent and turn down Satan's lie that's exactly what the common carnal church member does today separates themselves from the true Living Word to hold to the church when Eve put a question upon the word whether God would keep his word whether he would punish or not Satan put a question and Eve believed it so putting a question on God's word has produced a hybrid therefore a dead religion and dead children and then when the church he says puts the question upon the word is he the same does he still live in his church and perform his signs and miracles that he did when he was here on the earth which he so surely promised us in John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and even greater than this shall he do for I go to my father these signs of all them that believe shall follow them the question is to the people today does he really mean it and when you accept what the church says does he really mean it then you put yourself in the same condition that e that Adam did and join yourself with the woman of the Church of this world and separate yourself from the blessings that God has promised to every believer that would separate himself from the world to the word now that's the truth and when we separate when we separate from the blessings of God then we have a religion with without power this is where brother Bram said in the message pardon he said God hates a powerless religion it's got to be power certainly it's a power to save a man from sin it's a power that can do signs and wonders and miracles as Jesus Christ promised they've zeroed in on the word of God back there and believed and they hit the target you zero the same way on the word of God it'll hit the target again it's got to because he's the same yesterday today and forever and this is what he's preaching about that in those messages there he there a great sermon I wish you'd go listen to it called look oh I remember one day coming out of a Revival meeting where I preached and I don't even remember where but I was coming back on the plane and I pulled out the little message look and as I read it I began to just weep and cry as I as I rejoice in that word look refocus and he says like a camera you look out there and then you you look through this camera binoculars and you see three deer he said but if you focus it it'll come down to one and he said that's with the word of God if it's out of focus you'll have three in the godhead if you focus it right it'll all come into one are you with me it's an hour and a time to refocus I don't know if you caught it or not but that's what God was telling us through his servant brother Murphy look Focus again look again God doesn't like a powerless religion God does not want that God wants to perform he wants to show himself alive our very hopes is a resurrection is our right our hopes of life is Resurrection the resurrection of Christ you see God wants to work in his church Jesus said I'll be with you always even to the end of the world the works that I do shall you do also St John 14:12 uh and even more than this shall you do for I go to my father and now the church tries to deny that get away to be more to get more members to be more popular now I want to ask you something the God is TR trying to perform in his church and the church is trying to perform by the Creed and the two can't work together you got to get rid of the Creed and get Christ in and how can you do it when he sees the blood when the blood has been applied with a sincere heart and a hand laid Upon Jesus Christ and a heart that's true before God to confess his wrong and be born of the Holy Spirit then the works of God would follow as he said it would do yes Church wants to perform to their Creeds to see how many members they can get but God wants to perform through the power of the blood to cre get Christians born again now God is sending out his last call his last voice his last prophecy Revelation chapter 10 tells after the coming of the mighty Angel which is Christ and he will cry with a loud voice or he will shout he'll bring a great message seven Thunders would be revealed there would be the Mysteries contained in the Seven Seals and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he sounds his message that mystery would be finished it would be the Capstone of the Mysteries it would be the final thing the final thing needed to add to the church would be the voice of God that would open up the entire Bible to us not make the Bible a new Bible in the sense that we have new doctrines but make the Bible new or fresh again because we are focused now no longer looking through the glasses of denomination and so then in verse then it comes down to the end there and he says the same Angel continues on saying take the book and eat it and thou must prophesy again so there must be a final voice to the final age and the bride and her messenger is the final voice to the final age let me tell you she is given voice to the Archangel so there for the voice of the Archangel I can get down to it and I won't get time to do it this morning I was hoping to but the Holy Spirit pulling me this way and that way for this service this morning I'm not and I've got to but I'll have to bring it another time but this bride will call the resurrection so the final prophecy is here and we she will prophesy again I just Echo what the prophet said but it'll be more than that she will actually prophesy again completing the scripture of Joel chapter 2 thy Sons and Daughters shall prophesy as I pour out my spirit on All Flesh so even as the original prophecy went forth in Acts two so would it be completed now in this last day as she prophesies again now God is making his last call now for somebody might be your last call this morning you don't even have a hope for tomorrow and if you're not a child of God you're not a Christian you don't have a hope for eternity but let me just say in the Bible God made Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven is lik UN to a King who set out a banquet for his son would be a a marriage of his son son and the invited guest and he made a call and it was treated frivolously I'm too busy this isn't important enough what to be a part of the marriage supper do you realize what you're turning down this is worse than Miss Obama not going Trump's inauguration I honestly they won't miss her but let me just tell you on the other hand this is an invitation given to to the marriage supper of the lamb and God sent a call for the marriage supper of Li and they made excuses oh I married a wife too busy with life well you know if you have married a the right wife she'd be coming with you she'd also be invited so what what happened when you went out and God didn't work out too good did it a lot of things don't work out real good when you don't walking god's will God's got a word you you you can get in the permissive will of God yeah God even May bless it he may even give your children out of that that will be saved and what God you know a lot of things will happen in God's permissive will but God's got a perfect will for your life and you young people don't have to go out and just choose any old thing out under where it becomes real Sin where it becomes real Sin is when you marry an unbeliever now let me just go there I married a wife another I bought a piece of ground I've been caught up in business this is my business I bought a yolk of oxin I've got to go try them everything was too important was a lot more important than this call I got bought this pair of boxing and I got to go try them why you know what come on what Jew would go and buy a pair of oxen and he never tried them first lame excuses come on everyone begin to make excuses and finally the king says you know I bid three times and the and and and they won't come but my my guess my table is going to be full I'm determined that my my my guest list will be filled and my every every seat will be S filled and every every person will be there so I tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to make a final call and I'm going to go out and I'm going to I'm going to say go out into the highways and the byways and compel them to come in amen Oh my he said if you won't come and he said you won't taste my supper amen I've given this call and denominationalism will turn it down and this one will turn it down but get out there and compel prostitutes and harlots I'm quoting amen and compel prostitutes and harlots and drunkards and whatever them is and bring them in and I'll straighten them up I have made my supper and my table is going to be set and there's going to be somebody there Hallelujah and brother R said God is going to send another shaken across the country where there's somebody still out there somewhere amen that's a predestinated seed that the light has to fall on somewhere in the world and I'll tell you today he's making his final call and I don't care if you've been a drunkard Hallelujah I don't care if you've been an alcoholic and nothing could help you I don't care if you've been in drugs I don't care how long you've been a prodal I don't care what kind of depths of sin that the devil has brought you in I don't care if you're the woman at the well amen the last call is going forth and he's calling now amen and he says oh whoever will come to me and open the door I will come in to him and I will f with him and I'll bring Pentecost into

to set free amen and if I were you I'd get out of your Pew and I'd come down of this Altar and I'd say here God I am obeying your call cuz he said he that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out and he will abundantly pardon amen he will abundantly pardon he will abundantly pardon thank God for his pardon this morning thank God for his grace the final call with the vinyl Stones Hallelujah come on
