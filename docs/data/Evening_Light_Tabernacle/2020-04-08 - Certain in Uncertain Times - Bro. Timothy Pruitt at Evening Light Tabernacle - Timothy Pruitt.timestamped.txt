[10:28] there were a few a number but he said
[10:30] with two or three be gathered in my name
[10:32] I'll be there in the Me's and if one or

[10:40] these knees tonight your hand lifted you

[10:47] believe that the god that's here present
[10:51] tonight is exam godless with you in your
[10:53] room right now
[10:54] so father we just bow our heads before
[10:56] your throne of grace in order what a
[10:59] privilege it is that these doors are
[11:00] still open the services are still going
[11:03] well I just did a calculation on my
[11:05] phone and just realize there's 11 people
[11:08] here tonight ninety-nine point nine six
[11:11] percent of the sheep are at home in
[11:14] order we're able to be able to stream
[11:16] tonight because you laid it upon a
[11:18] pastor's heart to put these things in
[11:20] place not knowing these times would come
[11:23] but yet now Lord were able to feed the
[11:25] flock at home not be here present so we
[11:28] just pray we all know you'll continue to
[11:30] bless our livestream efforts and all
[11:32] other media the podcasts everything
[11:35] every person that's here tonight putting
[11:37] their shoulder to the wheel Lord to make
[11:39] these service possible and Lord wherever
[11:41] they would go throughout the internet
[11:43] throughout the DVDs and in the audio
[11:45] cast wherever they would fall upon those
[11:47] ears father
[11:48] may the people receive and be blessed
[11:50] tonight Lord but we're not just hearing
[11:53] over words of a man but we're hearing
[11:54] the words of Christ in an endtime Lord I
[11:57] think about the the fear that's Lord
[12:00] just don't across our world our nation
[12:02] our country our state or even our own
[12:04] cities Lord we believe no matter how the
[12:07] darkness see is how permeated we are in
[12:10] it father we believe there's a light at
[12:12] the end time and we're so thankful Lord
[12:15] you provided your children a light Lord
[12:18] a light to guide their feet Lord to
[12:20] guide their path to illuminate their way
[12:22] and father we have a consolation tonight
[12:24] when many of the world as we know it are
[12:27] groping in fear and anxieties and
[12:29] worries and stress Lord we can lay our
[12:31] get on a pillow knowing that the God
[12:33] that we serve he's a mighty God he's a
[12:36] great God he understands our need he
[12:39] understands his situation and he's
[12:41] already provided the way he's already
[12:44] met the need
[12:45] he's already provided the answer so Lord
[12:47] is in uncertain times we can have
[12:50] certainty that you're still God tonight

[32:10] [Music]
[32:12] let's turn our Bibles to first King 17
[32:17] mandus in listenings that our study into
[32:22] different messages brother Branham spoke
[32:24] on be certain of God like to speak to
[32:27] you tonight on amen certain in uncertain
[32:31] times certain in uncertain times first
[32:34] King 17 verse 1 it says an Elijah the
[32:38] Tishbite who was of the inhabitants of
[32:41] Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God of
[32:44] Israel liveth before whom I stand there
[32:48] shall not be Dew or rain these years
[32:50] but according to my word and the word of
[32:54] the Lord came unto him saying get the
[32:55] hints and turned the eastward and hide
[32:59] thyself by the brook Cherith that is
[33:02] before Jordan and it shall be that thou
[33:05] shalt drink of the brook and as I have
[33:07] commanded and I have commanded the
[33:09] Ravens to feed thee there so he went and
[33:12] did according to the word of the Lord
[33:14] and he went and dwelt by the brook
[33:15] Cherith which is before Jordan and the
[33:19] Ravens brought him bread and flesh in
[33:21] the morning and bread and flesh in the
[33:22] evening and he drank of the brook and it
[33:25] came to pass after a while the brook
[33:27] dried up because there been no rain in
[33:29] the land and the word of the Lord came
[33:31] unto him saying arise get the in
[33:35] Zarephath which belongeth the Zion and
[33:38] dwell there behold I've commanded a
[33:41] widow woman there to sustain thee so he
[33:44] rose and went to their paths and when he
[33:46] came to the gate of the city behold a
[33:48] widow woman was there gathering of
[33:50] sticks and he called her and said fetch
[33:52] me I pray thee a little but water in a
[33:55] vessel that I may drink and as she was
[33:58] going to fetch it he called to her and
[34:00] said bring me I pray thee a morsel of
[34:02] bread in the hand and she said as the
[34:05] Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake
[34:08] but a handful of meal and a barrel and a
[34:10] little old and a cruse and behold I'm
[34:12] gathering two sticks that I may go in
[34:15] and dress it for me and my son
[34:17] that we may eat and die and I just said
[34:21] unto her fear not go and do as thou has
[34:24] said but make me thereof a little cake
[34:26] first and bring it unto me and after
[34:29] make it for thee and for thy son for
[34:31] thus saith the Lord God of Israel the
[34:34] barrel a meal shall not waste neither
[34:36] shall the cruse of all fail until the
[34:39] day that the Lord sent his reign upon
[34:41] the earth and she went and did according
[34:44] to the saying of Elijah and she and he
[34:46] and her house did he many days and the
[34:50] barrel of meal wasted not neither did
[34:52] the cruse of oil fail according to the
[34:55] word of the Lord which he spake by
[34:57] Elijah and it came to pass after these
[35:00] things that the son of the woman the
[35:02] mistress of the house fell sick and his
[35:05] sickness was so sore that there was no
[35:07] breath left in him and she said undal
[35:09] idea what how about to do with thee or
[35:11] thou a man of God or thou coming to me
[35:13] to call my sin into remembrance and to
[35:16] slay my son and he's sitting heard give
[35:18] me thy son and he took him out of her
[35:21] bosom and carried him up to a loft where
[35:23] you bowed and laid him upon the his own
[35:25] bed and he cried to the Lord and said O
[35:27] Lord my god has thou brought the evil
[35:30] upon the widow who my sojourn by slaying
[35:33] her son and he stretched himself upon
[35:35] the child three times and cried unto the
[35:37] Lord and said O Lord my god I pray thee
[35:40] let this child soul come again come into
[35:43] him again and the Lord heard the voice
[35:46] of Elijah and the soul of the child came
[35:48] into him again and he revived and Elijah
[35:51] took the child and brought him down out
[35:53] of the chamber into the house and
[35:55] delivered him unto his mother and Elijah
[35:58] said see thy son liveth and the woman
[36:01] said to Elijah now by this I know that
[36:04] thou art a man of God and that the word
[36:07] of the Lord is in thy mouth is truth
[36:11] hallelujah amen we'll let you be seated
[36:14] this evening certain in uncertain times
[36:18] I got to looking at these words certain
[36:22] and uncertain certain means to be known
[36:26] for sure or to establish
[36:29] beyond doubt or to be beyond the reach
[36:33] of doubt uncertain means not to be able
[36:37] to you can't rely on it or not known or
[36:40] definite and you know when brother
[36:42] Brandon would speak actually on both
[36:43] words he would speak about the uncertain
[36:45] sound and he would speak on certain be
[36:48] certain of God and you know in an
[36:50] uncertain sound he said things of the
[36:53] earth was shaking
[36:54] you can't put no confidence in anything
[36:56] everything is uncertain and anything
[36:59] that's uncertain he said I would just I
[37:02] like to stay away from the negative side
[37:03] he said I like it positive to be on the
[37:06] positive side but it goes on he said
[37:08] home life has become uncertain national
[37:12] life is uncertain the world is uncertain
[37:15] and I would like to just say right here
[37:17] that even in the best of times under the
[37:20] best conditions a life is uncertain it
[37:24] doesn't take a pandemic for life to
[37:26] become uncertain it it may become more
[37:28] uncertain but even life in general is
[37:31] uncertain we're not guaranteed or
[37:33] promised tomorrow our life is but a
[37:35] vapor and it can be here today and gone
[37:37] in just a few minutes but where he said
[37:40] we're just living in a place where the
[37:42] whole world is having a nervous
[37:44] prostration like shaking everything
[37:47] every nation everybody one of us
[37:50] everyone is afraid of another one and he
[37:53] says everything is shaking national
[37:55] light political life everything is shook
[37:57] up he said even Church life is shook up
[38:00] uncertain people don't even know hardly
[38:03] what to do anymore and we know this very
[38:06] much goes with what we're living in
[38:08] today you know it's very real the things
[38:10] that you read here in the uncertain
[38:12] sound because talking about church life
[38:14] you know this one thinks they got this
[38:15] right and this one's got this right and
[38:17] that one's got this figured out and all
[38:19] that's going on but he said though you
[38:21] know everything is uncertain we know the
[38:23] Bible speaks about everything that can
[38:25] be shaken will be shaken and you know
[38:29] and the world is uncertain that we're
[38:30] living in governments are uncertain life
[38:33] is uncertain amen people are grasping at
[38:36] ideas or whatever to prop themselves up
[38:39] because of uncertainties no one knows
[38:42] what
[38:43] it's next even the best of known people
[38:48] that are experts in their field they
[38:50] don't know what's next they don't know
[38:52] what's around the next corner amen
[38:54] you know and as I said even in the best
[38:56] of times this life is uncertain but we
[39:00] don't know when the last times together
[39:03] here on this earth you know just a few
[39:05] Sundays ago we met for the last time in
[39:08] a normal circumstance and for now and
[39:10] and what we see is normals and we hope
[39:12] to maybe one day get there we don't know
[39:14] nobody knows that's uncertain so life is
[39:17] uncertain you say well you're painting
[39:20] the awful dark picture and brother
[39:21] Branham said you asked me that question
[39:23] he said I intend to do that he said I
[39:25] want to do it I did it for a purpose is
[39:28] you asked is there anything certain and
[39:31] he says yes there is something certain
[39:35] there's one thing that's certain one
[39:37] thing you can put your confidence one
[39:40] thing you can make sure is right when
[39:42] everything else is gone when everything
[39:45] else is faded away when everything else
[39:47] is falling away
[39:48] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[39:51] words shall not fail God has placed us
[39:55] or given us the ability to stand upon a
[39:59] certain foundation it's a foundation
[40:02] that's beyond the reach of doubt Amen I
[40:04] don't mean doubts will come that'll mean
[40:06] doubts won't enter your mind that will
[40:08] mean you will face fears or have fears
[40:10] but we wouldn't when you come down to it
[40:13] and you get down to the bottom of where
[40:15] you're standing on you want to be
[40:17] standing upon the Word of God amen and
[40:20] be certain in uncertain times there's
[40:22] only one thing we can place our trust in
[40:25] in this hour there's literally living in
[40:26] is God's Word our money isn't certain
[40:29] our homes in certain our lands are not
[40:32] certain nothing earthly or temporary is
[40:35] certain but some are making this into
[40:38] something that is not this thing that
[40:40] we're going through they're drawing
[40:41] lines in the sand they're propping
[40:43] themselves up with quotes and things to
[40:46] try to make it to work you know making
[40:48] sayings that where the bride will get
[40:49] this virus and that's not certain
[40:52] it's no more certain than some someone
[40:55] in the bride or somebody that's a part
[40:56] of the bride it won't die in a car wreck
[40:58] or I won't to have some other disease or
[41:01] have some of the thing what is certain
[41:04] is the Lord God is he is he he will heal
[41:07] all our diseases and there we can have
[41:10] faith there we can stand upon I can't
[41:12] stand upon what somebody has come up
[41:15] with or what somebody thinks or what
[41:17] somebody got it all figured out I can
[41:19] only stand upon the Word of God you said
[41:22] well we have faith we won't get this
[41:24] disease brother man was saying like this
[41:25] he said sometimes faith will do great
[41:28] miracles and it still don't come from a
[41:31] spiritual heart hello somebody sometimes
[41:35] faith will do great miracles but still
[41:37] it doesn't come from a necessarily a
[41:39] spiritual heart our Lord said this he
[41:42] said many will come to me in that day
[41:44] and said have I not done this or done
[41:46] that in your name and then he said I
[41:48] will say to them depart from me you
[41:50] workers of iniquity
[41:51] what is iniquity is something that you
[41:54] knew to do right and you didn't do it
[41:56] and he will say I never knew you in the
[41:59] first place
[42:00] he said we're living in that day today
[42:02] he said but what we need today is not a
[42:05] lot of material things thank God not a
[42:08] lot of material things we have that but
[42:10] we don't need greater churches we don't
[42:12] need greater congregations we don't need
[42:15] more radio more television we don't need
[42:17] more of these save what we need today to
[42:19] be spiritual is a person that will
[42:22] humble themselves before God if anybody
[42:25] if you hadn't even got a penny but we'll
[42:27] pray to that spirit within them is
[42:30] satisfied all hallelujah it's satisfied
[42:33] with the goodness of God now listen you
[42:35] can have this moment and don't depend on
[42:37] you having a lot of people around you
[42:39] you can have it regardless if you got
[42:41] yourself by yourself or your family or
[42:43] maybe a hundred or five hundred but the
[42:45] point is you want to get to a place that
[42:48] when that spirit on the inside of you
[42:51] it's satisfied with the goodness of God
[42:54] and a revival can take place listen a
[42:58] revival is not dependent upon a big
[43:00] congregation a revival is not dependent
[43:03] upon
[43:03] church full Amen he said one or two
[43:06] people on fire for God Amen you can have
[43:08] revival in your home you can have a
[43:10] revival in your car you can have a
[43:12] revival but until that takes place
[43:14] inside our hearts and that will change
[43:17] our attitude that will change our
[43:20] atmosphere that we live in hallelujah
[43:24] that's what we need today Amen some
[43:26] people's attitudes and atmospheres got
[43:28] all out of whack and things are going
[43:30] the wrong way for them right now and and
[43:32] people are running in fear and things
[43:34] are happening but what gets you back to
[43:36] the right attitude and the right
[43:37] atmosphere it's getting in the presence
[43:40] of God not in the news not in the things
[43:43] of this world but getting in the
[43:45] presence of God and how do you get in
[43:47] the presence of God start thinking on
[43:49] him start praying to him start asking
[43:51] for him to move start feeding upon his
[43:53] word and letting this presence around
[43:55] you amen see we might not have a pair of
[43:58] shoes on our feet we might be dressed in
[44:00] rags but something will be in your heart
[44:03] singing a melody listen I don't know how
[44:07] far this is going to go we might get to
[44:09] these places I don't have no idea but
[44:11] you might get to where you don't have
[44:12] any sitting on a pair of shoes now that
[44:15] your dress may be rags but if you get to
[44:17] this place you'll still have something
[44:20] in your heart singing the melodies of
[44:22] God hallelujah the goodness of God and
[44:26] he said I would rather have that that
[44:29] all the money in the world cuz money
[44:33] ain't certainly can be here today and
[44:35] gone tomorrow he can be worth of a
[44:37] hundred dollars one day and not worth a
[44:38] cent the next day hallelujah so you
[44:41] can't save natural things you know we're
[44:43] always a blessing of God you know David
[44:46] spoke to the Lord that the Lord seen the
[44:49] wicked spread forth you know like a
[44:51] great tree and then you know he said but
[44:53] did you God ask him he said did you ever
[44:55] consider that big tree at the end no
[45:01] matter how good a clothes they had or
[45:03] how much they had to eat but that isn't
[45:06] what gets you into the presence of God
[45:09] this body that we dwell in perishes
[45:12] regardless of how well is taken care of
[45:15] but it's the soul
[45:17] that matters it's a condition a
[45:20] condition of the spirit that moves us
[45:23] into the presence of the Living God you
[45:25] know anything we begin to talk about
[45:27] this woman that we read about this widow
[45:29] woman he said how that this little woman
[45:32] must have been of the calibre of Elijah
[45:35] but I thought that the people of God
[45:38] wouldn't suffer you know he's he talks
[45:41] about in many places he talks about the
[45:43] famine that had come in the land was
[45:45] because of the sin that was there but
[45:47] not everybody in the land was sinful
[45:50] come on now not everybody had bowed
[45:52] their knee to bail and we found that out
[45:54] a little later when God lied to us said
[45:56] I'm the only one that's serving you and
[45:58] then God told her what was his five
[46:00] seven thousand seven thousand heading
[46:01] bowed their knee
[46:02] amen so just because that was sin the
[46:05] land that didn't mean everyone was
[46:07] sinful and just because it was famine
[46:09] the land it didn't mean that those that
[46:11] were not sinful didn't suffer they
[46:15] suffered they went through things and
[46:17] she went she was tied down to her last
[46:20] meal her last time but just to give it
[46:24] just to eat and I'm gonna die I'm gonna
[46:27] give up my life because you know and
[46:30] said but see this woman must have been
[46:32] of the same caliber of Elijah but yes
[46:36] she was suffering yes she was going
[46:38] through things just as everybody else
[46:40] was going through things she had to go
[46:42] to the marketplace and go through
[46:43] whatever everybody else was going
[46:45] through or however it was set up in that
[46:47] day she had that she was gone she was
[46:48] starving she was in famine no water this
[46:51] she was going through it just like
[46:53] everybody else was going through it but
[46:56] yet she was of the caliber of Elijah
[46:59] hallelujah amen and see she had bent but
[47:02] she had been chosen to entertain God's
[47:05] prophet hallelujah it wasn't her that
[47:09] chosen it was God who chose her
[47:12] hallelujah unbelievers there's a people
[47:15] on earth that's of the calibre of Elijah
[47:17] that knows the God of Elijah it's not
[47:20] just a God of books and tapes and quotes
[47:22] and scriptures but it's a God that
[47:24] stepped out of it and became a living
[47:27] amen a living God among them producing
[47:30] the same signs and wonders hallelujah
[47:34] and she had been chosen to entertain him
[47:36] oh god I want to be chosen to entertain
[47:39] you
[47:40] hallelujah I'm talking about I want to
[47:42] be chosen to entertain the Spirit of God
[47:44] hallelujah
[47:46] the land was burning up and no doubt
[47:49] that sort of woman being of that caliber
[47:52] but a believer type Oh how many's a
[47:55] believer type hey man I love that is and
[47:59] brother Tim brought this out about her
[48:00] brother John Laird spoke about doing
[48:03] some work for my sister and all the
[48:06] things that you needed done or whatever
[48:08] and he said well that's what we do you
[48:10] know I mean and as believers we believe
[48:12] that's what we do don't matter what if
[48:16] it's good times or bad times were still
[48:18] believers right no matter for up or down
[48:20] or over sick or wealthier way wealthier
[48:23] we poor if we're believers that's what
[48:25] we do we believe and she was of the
[48:29] believer type
[48:30] he says for we see that God would not
[48:33] have called her if she hadn't been
[48:35] worthy to entertain God's prophet for he
[48:39] would have never sent his prophet to a
[48:41] house that was unworthy so it was not it
[48:44] was not the prophets choosing it was
[48:46] God's choosing it wasn't her bidding him
[48:49] he was God bidding him and he had been
[48:51] placed by a Brooke and Ravens were
[48:53] feeding them but in God's get God's
[48:56] commandment for something to take place
[48:58] and God surely went to a believer the
[49:00] same nature of Elijah but yet she was
[49:04] suffering she was going through the same
[49:09] things that was going on in the land
[49:11] she wasn't exempt from it Amen then she
[49:15] was going through things she was she was
[49:17] facing hardship she was and she was too
[49:20] but she was of the same caliber Amen
[49:22] others so she was of the believer type
[49:24] even though she was
[49:25] struggling she was a widow woman so she
[49:29] had a lot of problems things that
[49:31] happened in her life nobody to take care
[49:34] of her young husband her husband dead
[49:36] and the young boy to raise
[49:37] in the land they depended on crops you
[49:41] know and they did a boys a name you know
[49:43] no doubt wasn't able to go to a grocery
[49:45] store like we've been accustomed to go
[49:46] and do and and you know but had to put
[49:48] in the crops in the field to have
[49:50] anything to eat but everything now was
[49:53] decaying and it was because of the
[49:55] iniquity of the people and their moral
[49:57] decay had brought a drought on the land
[50:00] and they was all starving and dying
[50:06] believers and non-believers all starving
[50:10] and dying and then we find that no doubt
[50:12] she prayed night after night all night
[50:15] and she began to see that miracle barrel
[50:18] going down down down down and it must
[50:23] got to a place it was not even another
[50:24] cup full of meal in the barrel all she
[50:27] had was a little handful just a few
[50:29] drops and death was coming right to her
[50:33] door but there was no way of getting
[50:35] anymore
[50:36] the whole nation was starving and the
[50:40] oil was running out just a spoonful
[50:42] little just enough to make another
[50:44] bridge piece of bread and eat it and die
[50:48] well you told my sincerity in prayers he
[50:52] said you let's that strike your home
[50:53] you'll be a little more sincere in you
[50:56] were this morning when you know death
[50:58] lays at the door he's I believe we think
[51:01] perhaps like this we prayed all night
[51:04] long for one more day settle it it was
[51:07] going to be over she looked at the pale
[51:09] lips of her little boy three or four
[51:11] years old see his own bowels doing of
[51:14] the way as the flesh was coming to them
[51:15] it must have been a terrible thing as
[51:17] his mother seeing this going on day
[51:20] after day after day going down down down
[51:25] down he said may God let this soak and
[51:29] every one of you you if you never hear
[51:31] me preach again let this be a message
[51:33] it's strange most strange that sometimes
[51:36] let's things get that way hello somebody
[51:41] God lets things get that way you know
[51:45] when we've confessed our sins and we met
[51:47] every requirement that God requires and
[51:50] we believe on god there's a circumstance
[51:52] has to be met and according to the will
[51:54] where we met them all and yet he lays
[51:56] silent he won't answer us
[51:58] I'm sure I'm speaking to people this
[52:00] morning who's come to that place I've
[52:02] been there myself many times hello
[52:06] somebody I've been there myself many
[52:09] times this is his words and I have been
[52:14] there myself many times he said I've
[52:18] went back and I've traced my life many
[52:20] times I've turned over every stone and
[52:22] I'd find where I'd maybe done something
[52:24] wrong I'd go make it right Lord God I'll
[52:26] make it right and go do so come back
[52:28] again say now Lord now our God you'll
[52:31] have some assure that I've met the
[52:32] requester required to me to do and every
[52:34] requirement I've met and still seemingly
[52:37] he won't move he seems to sit silent
[52:40] that's when you've got to be sure he's
[52:44] God if he answers or not he's God if he
[52:50] does something about it or not he's God
[52:53] if he heals me or not he's God you know
[53:00] I got the privilege of meeting brother
[53:02] Giovanni Coenen there right there in New
[53:06] York been praying for them he goes to
[53:09] brother Yvan carry-ons Church and and it
[53:13] met him at a meeting up there in Canada
[53:15] a couple of last year's sometime and he
[53:18] was given a testimony of his wife and
[53:21] her longing for a child I don't remember
[53:24] exactly the details may not get it all
[53:26] exactly right but the gist of it is this
[53:29] she was born without something very
[53:31] needful in the reproduction in the
[53:34] organs and the female and she was born
[53:37] without it and and and it just the
[53:39] doctors told her it's impossible you
[53:40] can't have a baby but it just was on her
[53:43] I want a baby I want a baby she would
[53:44] not give up just day and night calling
[53:47] wanting the baby so he was just trying
[53:49] to occur
[53:50] finally you know not me but I think that
[53:53] went many times and talked with the
[53:54] pastor and finally this last result
[53:56] again he takes her to the pastor there
[53:58] it says look you know this is she's just
[54:01] so down and you know just constantly I
[54:04] want a baby I want a baby and the pastor
[54:06] asked her of these words he said what if
[54:10] sister he don't give you a baby then
[54:12] what said her head was bowed she lifted
[54:17] up their eyes tears streaming down and
[54:20] she said I'll still love him in just a
[54:24] few months later a little time later she
[54:26] had a and she got pregnant now they have
[54:28] a little daughter hallelujah
[54:32] no matter what you're going through you
[54:34] need to be certain he's God that's
[54:36] something you've got to stand on no
[54:38] matter how hard it may get no matter how
[54:40] terrible it may be no semen no matter
[54:43] how bad it may get it doesn't matter
[54:45] he's still God and he can get to your
[54:48] last meal he can get to your last crumbs
[54:52] and he moved on the scene just like he
[54:56] did for this woman he can get to your
[54:58] last breath and he'd come and move on
[55:00] the scene and everything be made totally
[55:03] whole he's that kind of God be certain
[55:08] in these moments you have to be certain
[55:12] he's God and if he's God he's got it all
[55:16] in control he's not lost it it's not
[55:19] waver waver always shaken is not because
[55:22] he's lost control come on somebody
[55:26] he's stealing control he's still
[55:28] orchestrating this all about to come to
[55:30] an end to a projected to his that to
[55:33] what he knows by is foreknowledge he's
[55:36] getting it to move right to that place
[55:40] hallelujah you must be certain before
[55:42] you do anything you must be certain in
[55:45] your heart that is God and when you met
[55:47] everything he said when you sure he's

[56:30] God's only testing your faith he loves
[56:34] to do that you confess your sins you met
[56:37] a requirement and yet he still lay
[56:40] silent remember faith says he is and
[56:43] faith holds own not knowing what is
[56:46] going to happen or how it's going to
[56:47] happen it just knows it will happen and
[56:51] he knows that he is and he's certain
[56:53] that he is and remember if he is then
[56:58] his word is true and if he required you
[57:03] to meet those circumstance and you did
[57:05] then he's obligated to take care of his
[57:09] word oh my god maybe I read that one
[57:14] more time let it sink in real deep it
[57:17] says if you he required you to meet
[57:19] these circumstances and you did he's
[57:23] obligated to take care of his word he's
[57:29] obligated to that word he has to bring
[57:32] it to pass because it's his word and it
[57:35] cannot fail hallelujah
[57:38] he says everybody knows moments don't
[57:40] back off and say well I never got healed
[57:43] he said you poor weak faith don't
[57:45] believe that if everything anything if
[57:46] everything's confessed everything's
[57:49] meant faith holds don't let nothing
[57:51] nothing but there's nothing will move it

[59:00] are you reacting I'm not saying you got
[59:02] to go out and test God and prove God
[59:04] you know we've read it here with the
[59:07] first Wednesday night of Martin Luther

[59:13] do what you supposed to do he meant wash
[59:16] your hands do all of that
[59:18] be smart fine but don't fear believe God
[59:26] if you do happen to get it he can heal
[59:29] you he will
[59:32] it's his word God likes to see how you
[59:36] were react when you say O Lord I believe
[59:39] you thou art my Savior I believe that
[59:43] you're my healer I believe that you're
[59:45] the one who gives the Holy Spirit the
[59:47] things that I'm requiring you're the God
[59:50] who gives that and when you confess all
[59:52] your sins and promise God that you do if
[59:55] you he'll let you get where well and
[59:57] then don't and then because it don't
[59:59] happen you run off like a coward
[1:00:00] somewhere God can use that there's no
[1:00:03] way for him to use it there's no way for
[1:00:05] him to hit you because the only answers
[1:00:08] faith then all of a sudden you go away
[1:00:11] and he can't answer you but true faith
[1:00:13] stands there being sure that God is and
[1:00:16] being certain that he is and if God asks
[1:00:19] just thing to be done to confess your
[1:00:21] sins and so forth and you've done it
[1:00:24] says he is and it's a certain is going
[1:00:27] to happen and your request has been
[1:00:29] granted hallelujah your request has been
[1:00:34] granted God is sure of his word and he
[1:00:38] knows his word will produce the healing
[1:00:41] that's required hallelujah
[1:00:45] I'm sure of his word I know that there's
[1:00:48] a serum here hallelujah
[1:00:51] but listen those where it says it's been
[1:00:53] said the virus that were really worried
[1:00:55] about ain't the co V of 19 the virus we
[1:00:58] worried about coldness and formulas and
[1:01:01] ungodly listen and sins of this world
[1:01:04] that's the virus we worried about but
[1:01:06] there is an inoculation there is a bla
[1:01:10] that I've taken all away from you and
[1:01:13] make a life out of you that you never
[1:01:16] thought possible to live you couldn't
[1:01:20] live on your own be sure he's God you
[1:01:26] know in so many cases of people that
[1:01:29] went through hard times you know yet
[1:01:33] Daniel and the Hebrew children that were
[1:01:34] taken off but they had purpose in their
[1:01:37] heart they was gonna serve God there
[1:01:38] wasn't ungodly people they were godly
[1:01:41] boys they purpose we're not going to eat
[1:01:44] the Kings meat we're not going to do
[1:01:45] this we're gonna pray even when the
[1:01:47] decree says not to we're gonna pray
[1:01:49] we're gonna give we're going to serve
[1:01:51] God we're gonna do what's right you know
[1:01:54] but yet even though good people and
[1:01:57] children of God they suffered they went
[1:02:01] through things they think they went
[1:02:02] through this like everybody else was
[1:02:04] going through and here they had to go
[1:02:09] for four or five Furness facing the
[1:02:14] certain death seemingly it was
[1:02:16] impossible seem like they'd to survive
[1:02:18] it a hundred percent death rate to be
[1:02:23] thrown into this fiery furnace seemed
[1:02:26] impossible but they said king we're not
[1:02:30] going to bow do what you wanted to do
[1:02:33] we're not gonna bow our God is able to
[1:02:35] deliver us but if he doesn't
[1:02:38] we're still not going to bow see they
[1:02:41] were sure and certain he's God the fire
[1:02:45] didn't change who he was the floods
[1:02:47] don't change who he is
[1:02:49] sickness don't change who he is problems
[1:02:51] don't change who he is financial
[1:02:53] struggles does not change who he is
[1:02:55] hallelujah storms don't change you you
[1:02:58] they knew he was Jehovah they knew he
[1:03:02] answered prayer whether he did in their
[1:03:04] case or not he would have to be for the
[1:03:06] good for they had made their statement
[1:03:08] they confess their sins and they were
[1:03:10] willing to walk into death and when they
[1:03:13] were going to the fiery furnace knowing
[1:03:15] that they were certain that if God let
[1:03:16] them burn up he would raise them up
[1:03:18] again they were certain of God because
[1:03:21] they knew that God would work everything
[1:03:23] for their good yah I mean we need to not
[1:03:27] forget that scripture even Romans 8:28
[1:03:30] to them that are the called according to
[1:03:33] his purpose
[1:03:33] all things work together he man he's
[1:03:36] working it all out for our good
[1:03:40] hallelujah
[1:03:42] I don't know that I just got a text from
[1:03:45] our God in Israel reminding us that
[1:03:48] today actually starts the celebration
[1:03:50] for Israel there started their holiday
[1:03:52] celebrating amen they're leaving Egypt
[1:03:55] their Exodus are leaving Egypt
[1:03:58] so Alleluia their Passover are coming
[1:04:01] now and then and then then being under
[1:04:04] the blood and watching the things that
[1:04:06] took a place Amen listen we're right
[1:04:09] here at the same times the same places
[1:04:14] hallelujah and I'm thankful I'm under
[1:04:16] the blood people get the idea as do the
[1:04:28] Jews the Jews thought that he was coming
[1:04:31] to save them from the Romans you know
[1:04:34] and he was going to raise up an army and
[1:04:35] he was going to defeat them by like he'd
[1:04:37] like he did though he's gonna drive out
[1:04:39] the Romans and set them free but that
[1:04:41] wasn't the freedom he was coming for he
[1:04:43] was coming to set them free from sin
[1:04:46] hallelujah in the first Exodus he set
[1:04:49] them free from the Egyptians
[1:04:51] and he took him to a landing the second
[1:04:53] one he set us free from sin that's what
[1:04:56] that blood is for amen that blood is an
[1:04:59] inoculation from sin but just because
[1:05:05] we're under the blood or the token does
[1:05:07] not mean we won't get sick come on
[1:05:12] people had get cancer I mean we have bad
[1:05:15] accidents our prophet died in a car
[1:05:17] accident and people made statements
[1:05:20] because he died he's anti word and
[1:05:22] you're anti word if you nonsense
[1:05:26] ridiculous nonsense this blood is an
[1:05:31] inoculation against sin but it also in
[1:05:36] that has a healing power but it does not
[1:05:39] make you a meme unit to in the sense of
[1:05:42] you'll never get sick
[1:05:44] you will get sick these bodies or not
[1:05:47] they men eternal bodies their temporary
[1:05:50] bodies their bodies is growing old just
[1:05:54] because you're under the token or on the
[1:05:55] blood don't mean you're not getting old
[1:05:58] then go our bodies are going down down
[1:06:00] down down down but this blood does
[1:06:05] produce an inoculation an immunity
[1:06:08] against sin but in it it also gives us
[1:06:12] the ability to draw strength from it to
[1:06:16] receive health again hallelujah and this
[1:06:20] is what he was talking about he said
[1:06:22] they go through the through the fire
[1:06:23] furnace you go through things in your
[1:06:25] life and you don't know if he's going to
[1:06:27] deliver you or not but that doesn't
[1:06:29] matter what matters he's God their
[1:06:34] statements was not depending on whether
[1:06:36] he was going to deliver them or not but
[1:06:39] there was depending on he's God here O
[1:06:42] king you're not God you don't have a
[1:06:45] final say in this matter I may go to a
[1:06:48] fire furnace but that's not the end of
[1:06:50] my life I got another life coming
[1:06:54] ha - look you're not God and I like to
[1:06:56] tell the devil
[1:06:57] you're not God you don't have a final
[1:07:00] say - when we draw our last breath God
[1:07:04] has that it's in his hands and I am in
[1:07:08] his hands and you are in his hands and
[1:07:11] be certain he is God because if he they
[1:07:18] died he they would raise up on the
[1:07:19] resurrection so they made this statement
[1:07:22] they were certain they walked right to
[1:07:24] the fiery furnace no matter to the
[1:07:29] decrees we're not going to bow they
[1:07:32] bound their hands are bound their feet
[1:07:34] they started them to the fiery furnace
[1:07:36] God standing there looking at it they
[1:07:39] were certain he was God they'd made
[1:07:41] their confession they had made
[1:07:42] everything right that they knew what
[1:07:44] they were certain and as they walked to
[1:07:46] the fire furnace right as the lapse
[1:07:49] moment came there he come riding out of
[1:07:52] heaven on the chariot of wind and began
[1:07:55] Fanning the breezes off of him while he
[1:07:57] talked with him and fellowship with them
[1:07:59] in the fire God let your faith comes to
[1:08:05] a spot where it will react
[1:08:09] there was job in the Old Testament
[1:08:12] another believer who had hard times lost
[1:08:16] a lot of things had a bad days real bad
[1:08:19] days Satan his accuser accused him of

[1:21:11] this moment where he came ask for it ask
[1:21:18] for that meal he said bring me that
[1:21:22] morsel of bread and listen to this she
[1:21:26] turns in her gloom
[1:21:30] in her gloom and I can hear her say
[1:21:32] something like this sir
[1:21:34] you're different from any other man I've
[1:21:36] seen the man I can hear speak you seem
[1:21:39] to be so positive what you're saying but

[1:21:53] all I got but what do we hear next
[1:21:56] but fetch me the little cake first see
[1:22:01] God first maybe in these times you
[1:22:06] forgot God before things are so busy
[1:22:10] life going on God's won't remind you
[1:22:13] he's first no matter what anybody else
[1:22:16] says what any evidence how gloomy it
[1:22:19] looks whatever it may be take God first
[1:22:23] doctor says I can't get well take God
[1:22:27] first I'm a sinner take God first I'm a
[1:22:31] prostitute I'm a drunkard
[1:22:32] take God's word first though your sins
[1:22:35] be as scarlet there'll be me white as
[1:22:38] snow though they are red like crimson
[1:22:39] he'll be made white like wool bring me a
[1:22:42] little cake first all that you got bring
[1:22:45] it to me
[1:22:46] are you willing to give everything you
[1:22:49] got and put it in his hands we like to
[1:22:55] be in control we like to be able to
[1:22:59] dictate where our money goes and where
[1:23:00] this goes and where that go can you put
[1:23:03] it in his hands are you willing and give
[1:23:08] it to him
[1:23:08] bring me a morsel of bread fetch me a
[1:23:11] little water there was something in her
[1:23:16] there was something that this is there's
[1:23:19] something in her that's moved and told
[1:23:23] her that man knows what he's talking
[1:23:26] about
[1:23:27] that man has met God that man has been
[1:23:32] in the presence of God that man is not
[1:23:35] just speaking empty words but that man
[1:23:37] is vindicated hallelujah amen what
[1:23:43] happened
[1:23:46] she turned in her gloom and she began to
[1:23:50] walk and it came to the place where she
[1:23:54] was obeying what he said she was
[1:23:59] listening to what he said she tuned out
[1:24:02] everything else anybody else said what
[1:24:04] her own thought says what everything
[1:24:06] else around her and she was only
[1:24:07] listening to what he said the gloom
[1:24:11] broke the gloom broke that saith the
[1:24:19] Lord the barrel will not go empty and
[1:24:21] the cruse run dry until the day that the
[1:24:24] Lord God sends rain upon the earth she
[1:24:27] made a cake and she gave it to the
[1:24:29] Prophet she went back and she got some
[1:24:31] more and the next day she went back and
[1:24:34] she got some more and the next day she
[1:24:36] went back and she got more every morning
[1:24:38] every day why because she took God at
[1:24:41] His Word listen the gloomy times that's
[1:24:45] looking right now may not look good
[1:24:47] gloomy if you'll just take his word and
[1:24:50] be certain he's God
[1:24:54] but the reason it looks so gloomy is
[1:24:57] you're looking at it the wrong way in
[1:25:02] Germany where the bottom talks about a
[1:25:05] picture I haven't ever seen the picture
[1:25:07] love to see it talk about the cloud land
[1:25:10] so when you see it off in a distance
[1:25:13] it's the horriblest looking gloom you
[1:25:15] ever seen clouds matted together looking
[1:25:19] them from a long distance but when you
[1:25:21] get up close to it it changes its
[1:25:25] angel's wings beating singing Hallelujah
[1:25:29] to the Lord so that's what gloom is
[1:25:32] sometimes if you look at it at a long
[1:25:37] distance it looks gloomy and dark but
[1:25:39] you just stay with God's Word and be
[1:25:41] certain is God and when it moves up
[1:25:43] close you'll find is just angel's wings
[1:25:47] beating together bringing it all about
[1:25:51] to serve his purpose
[1:25:54] and serve his will he said I know the
[1:25:57] thoughts that I think of you there are
[1:26:01] thoughts of an expected end whether it
[1:26:05] be a rapture whether it be going home by
[1:26:07] the grave whatever it is it's going to
[1:26:10] be worked for his will and for his way
[1:26:15] she was somewhat like Abraham was called
[1:26:19] on to give everything she had and lay it
[1:26:22] upon the altar he said maybe you're cold
[1:26:25] like that today give up your ways give
[1:26:29] up your unbelief give up everything you
[1:26:32] got and just take the oil and the word
[1:26:35] and mix it together and put it on the
[1:26:39] altar of self-sacrifice and you'll find
[1:26:42] out it'll call God on the scene as
[1:26:44] certain as I'm standing in the pulpit
[1:26:48] you need God tonight mix the meal
[1:26:52] together take you some meal take a
[1:26:55] little bit of Jesus and the Spirit of
[1:26:58] God and let it begin to mix together in
[1:27:01] your heart be joy unspeakable and full
[1:27:04] of glory and all of a sudden what looks
[1:27:07] so gloomy looks so dark and so dismal
[1:27:10] looks so helpless and so hopeless you
[1:27:13] realize angels have drugged clothes it's
[1:27:17] angels among us in her homes on her a
[1:27:20] job a wall of fire moving about us God
[1:27:24] working everything according to his
[1:27:26] purpose and his plan and his will we can
[1:27:31] be certain in uncertain times because we
[1:27:35] have a certain God god bless you tonight
[1:27:39] as we bow our heads maybe a little
[1:27:42] different
[1:27:46] maybe a little different speak
[1:27:53] just want to soak in real deep turn your
[1:27:58] eyes back on Jesus keep him on him don't
[1:28:02] let him drift off in these times look
[1:28:05] only into his wonderful face and the
[1:28:09] things of this world will go strangely
[1:28:12] dim the gloom would just dissipate and
[1:28:17] the jaw bells of heaven open up in your
[1:28:19] heart and your soul
[1:28:22] [Music]
[1:28:25] he's here for you tonight are you
[1:28:30] willing to lay your all upon the altar I
[1:28:33] believe these have been some real
[1:28:35] soul-searching times just looking over
[1:28:38] things making sure you met all the
[1:28:41] requirements it's a good time for that
[1:28:44] [Music]

[1:29:12] but all that fear
[1:29:16] and don't let man's words put fear in
[1:29:19] your heart either
[1:29:23] man's words are only temporary God's
[1:29:27] Word is eternal something we can stand
[1:29:30] on and be certain that he's God
[1:29:36] Lord Jesus father just a little thought
[1:29:40] just looking at these things Lord this
[1:29:42] week searching Lord looking Lord even my

[1:30:03] told me right now I never hold me since
[1:30:07] in sincerity lured me to just search
[1:30:09] themselves Lord maybe they've been
[1:30:11] looking toward the wrong things and
[1:30:14] gloominess is covered down without the
[1:30:16] fear spirits trying to attach the things
[1:30:20] God merely turned their eyes to you
