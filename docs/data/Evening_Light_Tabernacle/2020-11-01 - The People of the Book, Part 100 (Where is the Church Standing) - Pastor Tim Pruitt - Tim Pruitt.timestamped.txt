[38:24] i believe this is the last stage we've

[38:30] and it's going home time it is a
[38:33] little quote that brother kelly
[38:36] hildebrand shared today
[38:38] i thought i would read it um as we begin
[38:41] today god we
[38:43] would pray now for this great nation of
[38:45] ours
[38:46] that's in the time of the changing of
[38:48] presidents
[38:50] it might seem like a light thing but god
[38:52] it might change the
[38:54] destination of this nation oh lord
[38:57] thou who would choose the prophets and
[38:59] anoint the kings
[39:01] we pray your holy spirit will anoint the
[39:03] right man for us in this hour
[39:06] granted lord where the great rallies are
[39:09] going on on both parties
[39:11] father we realize you're not interested
[39:14] in parties
[39:15] it's man that you it's a man that you
[39:17] can trust so i pray father that
[39:20] somewhere along that they'll choose the
[39:22] right man for the hour
[39:25] we know that the hour has come when the
[39:28] wrong man will be
[39:29] chosen chosen to so we pray father
[39:33] that you'll give us a little more time
[39:36] to bring in the lost
[39:38] you know i think that's the desire of
[39:40] every true christian let's find that
[39:42] last one
[39:44] when that last one is found and his name
[39:46] is dipped in blood
[39:48] he's going to be going home time a
[39:51] rapture
[39:52] promised error the book will be closed
[39:55] it'll be finished then
[39:58] but somewhere somehow and at some time
[40:03] we're going to be praying the last
[40:05] prayer prayed in the bible
[40:07] which says he which testifies these
[40:10] things sayeth
[40:11] surely i come quickly amen and here's
[40:14] the prayer
[40:15] even so come lord jesus

[47:38] he gave jesus christ and jesus gave
[47:41] it in his name with this assurance ask
[47:45] the father anything in my name
[47:48] and i'll do it oh brother waiting for
[47:51] the manifestations of the sons of god
[47:54] the position the church as i said
[47:58] the book of ephesians the book of joshua
[48:01] and joshua's placing the people where
[48:04] they belong and
[48:05] if they wouldn't stand still he'd put
[48:07] them here and
[48:08] and said he'd run over to manassas land
[48:10] and this one would come back
[48:12] fussing and stewing and how are they
[48:14] ever going to get along
[48:15] one says i'm baptist i'm methodist i'm
[48:18] pentecostal i'm one of some twoness i'm
[48:20] so and so
[48:21] how are you going to do it god's wanting
[48:24] to place
[48:25] his church sons and daughters of god
[48:28] and he said let me live to see it this
[48:31] was his prayer
[48:33] let me live to see it he said i can just
[48:36] it's so close i can just feel it with my
[48:39] hands
[48:40] almost look like it's right there and
[48:43] i've longed to see it waiting for the
[48:45] time
[48:46] when walk down the street and there lays
[48:48] a triple a in there
[48:50] and from his mother's womb silver and
[48:52] gold and by none or waiting for the
[48:55] manifestations of the sons of god
[48:57] hallelujah
[48:58] when they'll when god will make himself
[49:00] known when they'll stop
[49:02] sickness they'll stop cancer they'll
[49:04] stop
[49:05] diseases you think cancer is something
[49:08] that
[49:08] the bible said there's coming a time
[49:10] that men will rot in their
[49:12] right in their flesh and the buzzards
[49:14] will eat off the carcasses before they
[49:16] even die
[49:17] and cancer's a toothache to what's it
[49:20] coming but remember
[49:21] that horrible thing was forbidden in
[49:23] that day to touch those that had the
[49:25] seal of god
[49:27] and that's what we're striving for now
[49:28] is get in
[49:30] and be positionally placed into the
[49:33] kingdom of god
[49:35] before these horrible plagues strike
[49:38] oh my he's so here we are he's
[49:41] asking the question where are we
[49:44] standing
[49:45] felt like he was on the brink or on the
[49:48] edge of it
[49:49] said it's so close even now that i could
[49:52] almost seem like
[49:53] feel it with my hands and i'd say where
[49:57] are we standing
[49:58] where has god positioned us at
[50:01] you know what is the blood done for us
[50:04] when a bloody lamb
[50:05] stepped forth to take the book and to
[50:08] lose its seals and confers the title
[50:11] upon us you see adam before the fall was
[50:15] in position as a son of god and
[50:17] he operated uh in faith and with the
[50:20] power
[50:21] and authority of all of heaven behind
[50:24] him and he spoke
[50:26] and trees moved and he commanded and
[50:29] winds obeyed
[50:31] he exercised his rights over the animals
[50:34] and called them by name and
[50:36] whatever he called them that was their
[50:38] name
[50:40] and then of course by satan coming in
[50:43] and deceiving eve
[50:45] because adam was not deceived but the
[50:47] woman being deceived was in the
[50:49] transgressions
[50:50] of the bible then adam surrendered the
[50:53] title
[50:54] to everything earthly even his body
[50:58] and and so again that that forfeited
[51:02] title deed went
[51:03] back in the hands of almighty god
[51:06] and that's where it has remained until
[51:09] the day that we're living in when god
[51:12] and when heaven moves and this and the
[51:14] seals are open and the mysteries are
[51:16] revealed
[51:17] we're living in a very great hour
[51:20] we're right here at the closing of time
[51:24] for the bride of christ and and the
[51:26] beginning of eternity for her as she'll
[51:29] move from
[51:30] this dimension into the eternal
[51:31] dimension
[51:33] and the earth will go on in time of
[51:35] course into the millennium
[51:37] and a thousand years and finally come
[51:39] back into eternity itself but
[51:42] we we get to go before that time
[51:45] and i'm glad for that because i'm glad
[51:48] that
[51:49] we don't have to wait for the day for
[51:51] our eternity to begin
[51:54] to leave time and to go into eternity
[51:58] but he but again the title deed to earth
[52:01] and to eternal life when adam forfeited
[52:04] of course satan's dirty hands could not
[52:06] take it
[52:07] amen so it went back in the hands of the
[52:09] original
[52:10] owner god himself and there
[52:14] the title deed to eternal life when adam
[52:17] forfeited went back in the hands of god
[52:20] back into the hands of the owner and it
[52:22] was been waiting
[52:24] for redemption claims
[52:27] waiting for a time where that that would
[52:29] come
[52:30] as was pictured in the bible a bloody
[52:33] lamb
[52:34] that would step forth and claim the book
[52:37] for man
[52:38] and of course we're living in that time
[52:42] in that generation and
[52:43] and of course you may ask what is this
[52:46] title deed well it's an abstract it is a
[52:48] deed
[52:49] that because it is an abstract that's
[52:51] been cleared
[52:52] that that everything that was against it
[52:55] is
[52:56] all the debts and the liens and the
[52:58] claims against it
[53:00] and against us from claiming it has been
[53:03] wiped away what a place to be standing
[53:07] where the prophet could look out and say
[53:10] that
[53:10] you never did it in the first place but
[53:13] you're the sinless
[53:15] virtuous bride of jesus christ
[53:18] standing there and so you never did it
[53:21] in the first place
[53:25] what a place to stand what a place where
[53:28] the blood has made you to stand
[53:32] you see the the redemption of this book
[53:36] means that all legal possession
[53:39] to everything lost by adam and eve
[53:43] amen that it now comes back in our
[53:46] possession that we possess
[53:48] or we have the right to claim
[53:51] everything that adam lost
[53:55] including our immortality
[53:58] are you with me amen it's legal
[54:01] possession to the abstract title deed
[54:04] of eternal life means that you possess
[54:09] everything that adam and eve lost
[54:13] you know adam couldn't make the
[54:15] requirement for redemption
[54:18] he had sinned and he had separated
[54:20] himself from god
[54:22] and was across the chasm a deep chasm
[54:25] and the fellowship was not there the
[54:28] camaraderie the
[54:29] the friendship the walking with god that
[54:31] he had had and experienced
[54:33] wasn't there any longer he had crossed
[54:36] the chasm
[54:37] he had lost he'd lost the ability to
[54:40] operate as a son of god he was still
[54:42] every bit human
[54:44] in fact he was more human because now he
[54:47] was not
[54:48] immortal in an immortal body but a
[54:51] mortal body
[54:53] and and so he needed redemption himself
[54:56] and
[54:57] he couldn't do it moses couldn't do it
[55:00] jeremiah couldn't do it any of the great
[55:03] prophets of the ages past
[55:06] could not do it amen so god
[55:09] wrapped himself in a blood cell and came
[55:13] and
[55:13] by the spoken word placed himself into
[55:16] the womb
[55:17] of a virgin and in the as that earth
[55:20] wrapped around him and built cells
[55:22] around him
[55:23] that here came god dressed
[55:27] in human flesh amen to pay the price of
[55:31] redemption to be
[55:33] the lamb so god portrays himself as a
[55:36] lamb and as a sacrifice
[55:39] the perpetuation and provides a blood
[55:42] that wipes away every stain
[55:45] of sin
[55:48] doing so when he was here and through
[55:50] his work at calvary
[55:52] he wiped out the debt of the old
[55:55] testament saints
[55:56] and they rose with him in a glorious
[55:59] triumph
[56:00] on the day of the resurrection those who
[56:04] were kept in abraham's bosom
[56:07] ascended with him and were raptured up
[56:10] with him
[56:12] amen the lord the the lord
[56:16] went up with the lord and and for the
[56:18] living although that the holy spirit had
[56:20] anointed men
[56:21] down to the ages and time and never had
[56:24] the holy spirit
[56:25] ever a bodhian man that were born in sin
[56:30] because god could not dwell in an
[56:32] unclean vessel
[56:34] so when he would come down in the past
[56:36] he would create a body
[56:38] out of the 16 elements and walk in it
[56:40] and appear to abraham
[56:42] is that right this is the way he would
[56:44] do and then he would just step out of
[56:46] that body he would go back to the dust
[56:48] and the way he would go again
[56:49] and he'd come again and appear to man
[56:52] again
[56:53] but this time god was doing something
[56:56] different
[56:57] he would wrap himself in first in the
[57:00] womb
[57:01] of a virgin and god would take on flesh
[57:06] is that right i want you to think on
[57:09] this flesh
[57:09] it was it was flesh that was cursed
[57:13] it was flesh that was mortal
[57:17] are you with me it was flesh that was
[57:20] that had not that that as the earth was
[57:24] had not been redeemed and god had cursed
[57:26] the earth
[57:27] that jesus wrapped himself god wrapped
[57:30] himself
[57:31] in cursed earth and he brought that
[57:34] obedient
[57:36] there at the river jordan and you know
[57:40] i'm not making this up you can find this
[57:42] in
[57:42] in the future home and other sermons
[57:44] like that that brother branham preaches
[57:46] he i'm not making this up god wrapped
[57:49] himself
[57:50] in cursed earth and he brought that
[57:52] earth down to jordan
[57:54] and he said from this earth i will start
[57:57] my redemption
[57:58] and with this one i will redeem the rest
[58:00] of them
[58:04] now thinking of that
[58:08] here was the living
[58:11] the death of the old testament saints
[58:14] had been cleared they rose
[58:17] and took on immortality
[58:20] they went from there and ascended with
[58:23] him
[58:25] but what about the living what about
[58:27] peter james and john and those who
[58:30] who were were not who were not
[58:32] translated
[58:34] what about them he had paid the debt for
[58:37] both
[58:37] the living and the dead is that right
[58:42] amen but they were instructed to go and
[58:45] wait in the upper room
[58:47] until they were empowered from on high
[58:50] are you with me now amen so there
[58:53] again never had the holy spirit abode in
[58:56] man
[58:57] until jesus christ and he came and abode
[59:00] with him and he said the holy ghost that
[59:02] i'll sin will abide with you
[59:04] forever it won't be like the prophets
[59:07] and the old testament will come down in
[59:09] an
[59:09] ark man and then and then lift and come
[59:11] down and anoint and lift
[59:13] and come down and anoint and lift but
[59:16] this one would abide with you
[59:18] forever
[59:18] [Applause]
[59:21] and there on the day of pentecost we we
[59:24] see
[59:25] something happening when god's newborn
[59:28] sons walked out of the upper room
[59:34] hallelujah filled with the holy ghost
[59:36] and it wasn't riches
[59:38] of gold and silver that they had but it
[59:41] was the riches
[59:42] of the power of the spoken word that the
[59:46] spirit would start
[59:47] speaking right out of them hallelujah
[59:51] amen as it first was manifested in them
[59:54] speaking out
[59:55] in languages as words
[59:58] came out of their mouths declaring
[1:00:02] the miracles of god
[1:00:06] in acts chapter 2 and verse 1 and when
[1:00:08] the day of pentecost was fully come
[1:00:11] there was all with one accord in one
[1:00:14] place
[1:00:18] with one mind one accord
[1:00:21] one passion
[1:00:24] oh my think of this now you know if that
[1:00:28] had a
[1:00:29] um if that had a voting paper to to fill
[1:00:32] out
[1:00:33] as to who was going to be the the next
[1:00:35] uh pontiff or
[1:00:37] next um the the next one that would
[1:00:40] reign as harriet or the governor
[1:00:42] if they were electing and whatever maybe
[1:00:45] everybody's
[1:00:46] maybe everybody's uh voting paper was
[1:00:49] filled out differently
[1:00:51] one like this one and one like that one
[1:00:53] and one this and one had this opinion
[1:00:55] and that opinion
[1:00:57] let me just tell you there was still
[1:00:59] they were still human
[1:01:01] it meant some still like apple pie and
[1:01:03] the other preferred cherry
[1:01:06] i mean they still had differences but
[1:01:09] they had one passion
[1:01:12] amen they were with one mind on
[1:01:15] something
[1:01:17] and what were they in agreement on they
[1:01:19] had a passion
[1:01:20] and that was to be a dude with power
[1:01:23] from on
[1:01:24] high that was their passion that was
[1:01:27] their drive
[1:01:28] that's why they gathered together
[1:01:32] amen oh god make that our passion
[1:01:35] amen the reason we gather the reason we
[1:01:39] come together
[1:01:40] amen is not to talk to politics or have
[1:01:43] our different ideas
[1:01:44] or each one is doctrine but everyone
[1:01:46] have that one passion
[1:01:48] that is to be filled with the holy ghost
[1:01:51] amen to see the spirit of god move in
[1:01:54] the church
[1:01:55] and give her the same passion to save
[1:01:58] drive
[1:01:59] the same ambition
[1:02:01] [Applause]
[1:02:05] just as they were crying out there for
[1:02:07] the coming of christ the holy spirit
[1:02:10] we ought to have a one passion one drive
[1:02:14] amen as we assemble together this
[1:02:16] morning
[1:02:17] amen even so come lord jesus
[1:02:21] come in this service a man come against
[1:02:24] us
[1:02:25] we have those that need the holy ghost
[1:02:28] we have those that need sanctification
[1:02:30] we have those that need to come to
[1:02:32] repentance we
[1:02:34] have those that needs a healing we have
[1:02:36] those that need
[1:02:37] deliverance from their selfishness from
[1:02:39] their pride
[1:02:40] from their sickness from their disease
[1:02:42] we need jesus
[1:02:44] if there was ever an hour we needed
[1:02:47] jesus it's this hour
[1:02:49] we need jesus
[1:02:52] it's not going to be the call to drive
[1:02:55] the passion
[1:02:57] and the reason for assembling together
[1:03:00] even this morning as they were
[1:03:02] assembling in the upper room
[1:03:05] amen amen
[1:03:08] it ought to be something a passion that
[1:03:11] outweighs every fear the way
[1:03:14] outweighs every other reasoning i want
[1:03:17] one thing i want to see jesus
[1:03:21] are you with me amen you know you know
[1:03:24] again
[1:03:24] i i pass churches on the way that are
[1:03:27] sitting empty because people
[1:03:28] are afraid of the kobe day and had
[1:03:30] church in nine months or
[1:03:32] ten months because they're afraid
[1:03:38] and there's reason for fear they're
[1:03:42] i mean you know there are those that
[1:03:43] have went to the hospital some have died
[1:03:47] many have died there's been it's an
[1:03:50] illness you don't want
[1:03:52] but i'll tell you what you're going you
[1:03:54] know it's going to come by your way
[1:03:56] and you might get it in church yeah you
[1:03:58] might
[1:03:59] you might get it camping yeah you might
[1:04:03] but it's coming by
[1:04:06] and you're going to need a healer
[1:04:10] you're going to need a healer you're
[1:04:13] going to need the miracle worker
[1:04:15] are you with me they had one passion
[1:04:18] luke 24 49
[1:04:19] behold i send the promise of my father
[1:04:23] upon you
[1:04:23] but carry you in jerusalem until
[1:04:27] you be with endued with power from on
[1:04:30] high
[1:04:32] again this was their passion
[1:04:36] oh i could hear brother branham
[1:04:38] preaching it over again sirs
[1:04:40] we would see jesus i think that again
[1:04:44] is the cry that ought to be for us in
[1:04:46] every service says
[1:04:48] we would see jesus we want to see jesus
[1:04:52] in our prayers we want to see him in our
[1:04:54] songs
[1:04:55] we want to see him in our worship we
[1:04:57] want to see him in our preaching
[1:04:59] we want to see him in the reception of
[1:05:01] our preaching
[1:05:06] we need jesus there's never been a time
[1:05:11] even more important than this one
[1:05:14] for jesus
[1:05:21] thinking of it they were there again
[1:05:24] acts 1 and 4 being assembled together
[1:05:27] with them
[1:05:28] he commanded them that they should not
[1:05:30] depart from jerusalem
[1:05:32] but wait for the promise of the father
[1:05:35] which saith he ye have heard of me for
[1:05:38] john
[1:05:39] truly baptized with water but ye shall
[1:05:41] be baptized
[1:05:43] with the holy ghost not many days hence
[1:05:47] so again they were instructed as they
[1:05:50] were waiting with one accord verse 8
[1:05:52] said
[1:05:53] jesus gave them these words but you
[1:05:55] shall receive
[1:05:56] power after that the holy ghost has come
[1:05:59] upon you
[1:06:00] and you shall be witnesses unto me boats
[1:06:02] in jerusalem
[1:06:04] in judea and samaria into the outermost
[1:06:07] parts
[1:06:07] of the earth and then on the day of
[1:06:11] pentecost
[1:06:13] when the day of pentecost was fully come
[1:06:16] this is acts chapter 2 and verse 1.
[1:06:19] i want you to stop in for a moment
[1:06:22] because we are now
[1:06:23] in another time of pentecost
[1:06:28] now we're not azusa streets we're we're
[1:06:32] not trying to
[1:06:33] reproduce azusa street
[1:06:36] that is not our our purpose they were
[1:06:39] not the original
[1:06:40] and they were not the original vine they
[1:06:42] were another graft put on the tree
[1:06:45] but we're living the day where another
[1:06:47] pentecostal branch must come up
[1:06:49] out of that root
[1:06:52] i want to say that's exactly what god
[1:06:54] has produced in this day
[1:06:57] but don't let it be like when jesus came
[1:06:59] looking for fruit and found none he
[1:07:01] cursed it
[1:07:03] because this is a time where god is
[1:07:05] expecting the fruit
[1:07:08] the same life the same power the same
[1:07:11] holy ghost
[1:07:12] the same spirit of god are you with me
[1:07:14] amen
[1:07:15] notice they were on when the day of
[1:07:17] pentecost was fully come they had come
[1:07:19] down through
[1:07:20] seven weeks of feast days
[1:07:23] where they came from the passover and
[1:07:26] they marked
[1:07:26] seven weeks from the from the day of the
[1:07:29] unleavened bread
[1:07:31] until until pentecost
[1:07:34] and when it had fully come when the
[1:07:37] seven
[1:07:37] weeks had come to its end
[1:07:43] this is where we're at
[1:07:47] we're not even at the beginning of the
[1:07:49] last church age
[1:07:51] we're at the end of the time in the
[1:07:53] beginning of eternity we're right here
[1:07:56] on the brink
[1:07:58] of every scripture that has been
[1:08:00] prophesied to be fulfilled in this hour
[1:08:02] that's where we're standing
[1:08:05] i mean we're we're here with the in the
[1:08:07] last days little children
[1:08:09] this is where we're at amen and when the
[1:08:13] day of pentecost was fully come
[1:08:15] they were all in one accord in one place
[1:08:19] amen i'd like to see the church in one
[1:08:22] place i don't mean in this building
[1:08:25] i don't mean in louisiana i don't mean
[1:08:28] in the united states
[1:08:30] i don't mean one place in the world
[1:08:32] somewhere and all gathered here there
[1:08:34] there
[1:08:35] like some cult gathering that's not what
[1:08:37] i'm talking about
[1:08:39] but when i would like to see us all in
[1:08:41] one place
[1:08:42] that means is that we see our place
[1:08:45] in the scripture that we understand that
[1:08:49] we're here in the fulfillment
[1:08:51] of all the promises of god that even as
[1:08:54] jesus fulfilled the old testament
[1:08:56] we are living in the time and the day
[1:08:58] where we fulfill
[1:08:59] the new testament
[1:09:07] they were all with one accord
[1:09:10] they had one accord
[1:09:13] come holy spirit
[1:09:17] come sweet spirit there's a promise
[1:09:20] given to us
[1:09:22] and we want it and we're not leaving
[1:09:24] till we get it
[1:09:28] we're going to stay in this place we're
[1:09:30] going to stay in this position
[1:09:33] until we receive it somebody with me
[1:09:37] amen this is exactly where we are we are
[1:09:39] here in the fulfillment of scripture
[1:09:42] and we must stay steady we must look
[1:09:45] here you know
[1:09:46] you know you don't know what's going to
[1:09:47] be coming who can predict
[1:09:50] i can't predict will there be riots
[1:09:52] break out in the street
[1:09:54] where there be pandemonium everywhere
[1:09:56] where there be
[1:09:57] militias and fighting and wars and
[1:10:00] and civil war i don't know what's coming
[1:10:03] nobody else does either
[1:10:07] god holds it in his hands and it really
[1:10:10] doesn't matter
[1:10:12] what they do out there what are you
[1:10:15] doing
[1:10:20] we're a winner either way we can't lose
[1:10:24] amen no matter who wins in the white
[1:10:27] house we can't lose
[1:10:32] amen again i'm praying that the man that
[1:10:35] will be the one that
[1:10:36] will will usher in the end time the one
[1:10:39] that god has ordained that he steps into
[1:10:41] place
[1:10:43] whoever that is now
[1:10:47] but anyway when the day of pentecost was
[1:10:49] fully come they were all
[1:10:52] with one accord and one place
[1:10:56] and again i want to i want to go back
[1:10:58] over it again
[1:10:59] just to drill it into you we want to see
[1:11:02] that they were told to gather at a place
[1:11:06] but you shall receive power after the
[1:11:08] holy ghost has come
[1:11:11] you shall be baptized with the holy
[1:11:13] ghost not many days hence
[1:11:16] all of these words that have been spoken
[1:11:18] to them stay there
[1:11:20] carrying the city of jerusalem till you
[1:11:22] be endued with
[1:11:23] power from on high
[1:11:27] now we're not waiting on the holy ghost
[1:11:30] to come
[1:11:33] he's already come he's already here
[1:11:38] even the pillar of fire people said well
[1:11:40] where is it brother branham said
[1:11:42] and brother branham said and i didn't
[1:11:43] bring the quote with me today but he
[1:11:45] says
[1:11:46] he he said you know it's not me that
[1:11:48] that has the pillar of fire the pillar
[1:11:50] fires in the church
[1:11:56] it's in his people somebody help me
[1:11:59] preach
[1:12:00] that's where he is the pillar of fire is
[1:12:02] among us
[1:12:03] he hasn't left us as brother branham
[1:12:06] would say when i
[1:12:07] leave the city the holy spirit will not
[1:12:09] leave
[1:12:14] now brother brandon's been gone almost
[1:12:15] as long as he was here
[1:12:18] next year in 2021 he will be in in
[1:12:21] december
[1:12:22] he will be he will be gone as long as he
[1:12:24] was here upon the earth
[1:12:27] he's already been gone longer than what
[1:12:29] he ministered here on the earth
[1:12:34] and we're in overtime
[1:12:41] if he was saying back then that the
[1:12:42] coming of the lord is past due
[1:12:44] what about now amen
[1:12:48] so here here again this these are what
[1:12:50] they had
[1:12:51] one one accord was and what's got to be
[1:12:55] the one accord that we have
[1:12:58] what is the thing that we must be saying
[1:13:00] in our hearts
[1:13:02] now come on church you know
[1:13:05] that we're in the time of delay
[1:13:09] what men say that the lord has delayed
[1:13:12] his coming
[1:13:14] for since the prophets have fallen
[1:13:15] asleep all things remain as it was from
[1:13:17] the beginning
[1:13:18] you know it's in this time jesus
[1:13:20] predicted if we would have this time and
[1:13:22] he said the servants
[1:13:24] would begin to fight one another and
[1:13:26] beat one another
[1:13:28] so mother we and we've seen plenty of
[1:13:31] arguments and debates and everything
[1:13:33] else
[1:13:34] somebody helped me preach i mean this is
[1:13:37] a part of the time of delay
[1:13:39] and we started out on this and that was
[1:13:42] we
[1:13:42] we had a heart we were we wanted to see
[1:13:45] the coming of the lord
[1:13:46] but as time goes along what do we do
[1:13:50] now we're we're
[1:13:53] focusing more on tarion
[1:13:56] till he comes
[1:14:00] rather than his coming
[1:14:04] so more preparations are being made more
[1:14:06] thought is
[1:14:07] being put into how do we
[1:14:10] stay here
[1:14:16] how do we best survive
[1:14:19] things that are coming how do we prepare
[1:14:23] for what's coming and that's the wrong
[1:14:26] focus
[1:14:30] amen our hope is not on how we can
[1:14:33] fortify ourselves
[1:14:35] i know gun sales are out of the roof
[1:14:39] weapons and and ammo and preparations
[1:14:43] and plans
[1:14:44] and food and everything else is
[1:14:47] advertisement everybody
[1:14:48] buy this certain thing you know so you
[1:14:51] survive
[1:14:52] i'll tell you i'm not interested in
[1:14:54] surviving
[1:14:56] i'm interested in leaving
[1:14:58] [Applause]
[1:14:59] we got a crazy world out there and i
[1:15:01] don't want to stay with the crazies
[1:15:04] amen i want to leave with those who have
[1:15:07] their mind on christ
[1:15:11] and this is where that that it had to be
[1:15:14] a focus on day
[1:15:16] we're looking for his coming then the
[1:15:18] coming of the holy spirit
[1:15:20] which is jesus the spirit of jesus
[1:15:24] somebody with me we're looking for the
[1:15:26] coming of jesus
[1:15:29] amen hallelujah and we know
[1:15:33] we know before he materializes in the
[1:15:35] sky
[1:15:36] and we meet him in the air that he's
[1:15:39] first
[1:15:39] got to be seen in a bright body
[1:15:43] [Applause]
[1:15:45] amen there's been the groom coming 2000
[1:15:47] years ago
[1:15:48] and of course we look to the meeting in
[1:15:50] the air but he's not coming to the earth
[1:15:53] we meet him in the air but on earth
[1:15:55] there's got to be a coming
[1:15:57] and that's a bride of people who have
[1:16:00] made themselves ready
[1:16:02] are people who know their god and do
[1:16:04] some exploits
[1:16:07] people who are under expectation for his
[1:16:10] coming
[1:16:12] well i'll tell you when people get their
[1:16:13] eyes on his coming
[1:16:15] and they prepare for his coming there's
[1:16:17] no divorces in the church
[1:16:21] there's no fighting in the home
[1:16:25] there's no rebellion come on amen sin
[1:16:28] goes out to out the door because
[1:16:30] people's harder on the coming
[1:16:33] but when people get their eyes off the
[1:16:35] coming
[1:16:37] and they get their eyes on carrying
[1:16:40] and that the lord has delayed his coming
[1:16:43] somebody with me amen and it just seemed
[1:16:46] like it was going to go on and on and on
[1:16:48] and on
[1:16:49] hey friends there comes a time where
[1:16:52] that
[1:16:52] everything wraps up
[1:16:57] and the bible prophesied it would be
[1:16:59] this
[1:17:00] and here we are in this day this time
[1:17:04] and we're standing at a particular place
[1:17:09] amen where that scripture is being
[1:17:12] fulfilled
[1:17:12] right here in this hour and we got to
[1:17:15] recognize where we're standing
[1:17:17] and have the one mind the one accord on
[1:17:19] the right thing
[1:17:28] here again when the day of pentecost was
[1:17:31] fully come
[1:17:33] they were all with one accord in one
[1:17:35] place
[1:17:36] and suddenly you know things happen
[1:17:39] suddenly suddenly
[1:17:43] we hear about a virus that will change
[1:17:44] our lives
[1:17:47] suddenly they they will say
[1:17:51] peace and safety and suddenly
[1:17:54] destruction will come right here while
[1:17:58] you've been
[1:17:59] sleeping you know one accord after
[1:18:01] accord has been done with israel
[1:18:04] amen never has been a time where where
[1:18:07] they could ever dream that there would
[1:18:08] be
[1:18:09] peace with israel and acceptance
[1:18:13] and they're they're signing them on
[1:18:15] board one after another after another
[1:18:17] is somebody with me remember but when
[1:18:20] they can say peace and safety then comes
[1:18:24] sudden let me tell you about the rapture
[1:18:27] just for a minute
[1:18:29] you think you're going to have a lot of
[1:18:31] warning about the rapture
[1:18:33] that they're just going to be you know
[1:18:35] everybody in this euphoria
[1:18:37] and whatever i'll tell you what in many
[1:18:39] ways it'll be just like another day
[1:18:50] and the only way you're going to know it
[1:18:51] is if you're
[1:18:53] walking with him
[1:18:56] just like you do every day serving him
[1:18:59] just like you do every day praying
[1:19:03] just like you do every day living for
[1:19:05] him just like you do every day
[1:19:11] you see by the time you find out what's
[1:19:14] going on
[1:19:16] it's going to be too late you got to be
[1:19:19] in tune now
[1:19:22] enough walked with god he got into
[1:19:25] position
[1:19:26] and he stepped into that position and it
[1:19:28] went long
[1:19:30] he was changed
[1:19:33] now and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:19:37] heaven
[1:19:37] as of a rushing mighty wind and it
[1:19:40] filled all the house where they were
[1:19:42] sitting and
[1:19:42] there appeared unto them cloven tongues
[1:19:44] like as a fire and it sat upon each of
[1:19:46] them
[1:19:47] and they were all filled with the holy
[1:19:48] ghost and began to speak with other
[1:19:50] tongues
[1:19:51] as the spirit gave them utterance verse
[1:19:54] 11.
[1:19:54] creates an arabian we do hear them in
[1:19:56] our speak in our tongues
[1:19:58] the wonderful works of god
[1:20:02] so their mouths were were not just
[1:20:05] jabbering something they were saying
[1:20:08] something
[1:20:10] and when the feasts of weeks were
[1:20:12] fulfilled they were here in one accord
[1:20:15] in the upper room and suddenly comes a
[1:20:17] sound from heaven
[1:20:18] as of a rushing mighty wind it fills the
[1:20:20] house
[1:20:21] and there appeared to them a pillar of
[1:20:25] fire
[1:20:27] the same one that was with moses
[1:20:30] is now come to leave the church amen the
[1:20:34] same one
[1:20:35] that was down down to the ages here he
[1:20:38] was to lead
[1:20:39] the church the same one that was seen by
[1:20:42] saul
[1:20:43] on the road to damascus that said i am
[1:20:46] in jesus
[1:20:47] whom you persecute
[1:20:50] jesus had returned but not in the
[1:20:53] corporal body
[1:20:55] but in his holy spirit and the sound
[1:20:59] as it came was a roar like a rushing
[1:21:02] mighty wind and
[1:21:03] a whirling ball of fire came into the
[1:21:06] room
[1:21:06] and licks uh portions of that fire
[1:21:10] began to spread out from it and separate
[1:21:13] and come
[1:21:14] and and it would fling out here and it
[1:21:15] would fall on this one and it would fall
[1:21:17] on that one and fall on that one until
[1:21:19] all they were in the house 120 of them
[1:21:22] were
[1:21:22] filled with the holy ghost
[1:21:26] and out of their mouths came
[1:21:29] words declaring the wonderful works of
[1:21:33] god
[1:21:34] expressed now in many different
[1:21:36] languages
[1:21:39] the curse of babylon with his confusion
[1:21:42] of language
[1:21:43] was reversed on that day amen when one
[1:21:46] heavenly
[1:21:47] language that was understood in every
[1:21:50] tongue and dialect
[1:21:51] because god would be having a bride out
[1:21:54] of every kindred tongue
[1:21:56] nation tribe and people and they would
[1:21:59] all speak
[1:22:00] one language
[1:22:03] hallelujah these words that brought
[1:22:05] amazement and conviction to some
[1:22:08] and mockery from others you know
[1:22:10] everybody has
[1:22:11] mixed reactions you get mockery from
[1:22:14] some amazement from others conviction
[1:22:16] from more
[1:22:18] amen and it must have spilled out into
[1:22:20] the street
[1:22:22] amen because soon there was a crowd of
[1:22:25] god-fearing jews
[1:22:27] who came to jerusalem from every nation
[1:22:30] under heaven
[1:22:31] and they when they heard the sound a
[1:22:34] crowd came together and
[1:22:36] and they were bewildered and astonished
[1:22:39] because each one heard in their own
[1:22:42] language it being spoken declaring the
[1:22:45] wonderful works
[1:22:47] and the miraculous power of god

[1:23:02] long she's
[1:23:03] all over the world are you with me amen
[1:23:06] but every place must come to the
[1:23:09] position
[1:23:10] where they are declaring the wonderful
[1:23:14] works of god

[1:23:18] alopecia

[1:23:28] wonderful works of god

[1:23:34] that's why we got to see church we've
[1:23:36] had a lot of theology and fussing and
[1:23:39] fighting and everything else
[1:23:40] but what we need is the people to be
[1:23:43] able to say

[1:23:47] same yesterday today and forever
[1:23:49] my god reigns he's there over every

[1:23:56] of people
[1:23:57] who know their god
[1:24:03] now others mocked saying these
[1:24:07] are drunk on some sort of new or strange
[1:24:10] wine
[1:24:11] don't forget the rapture hour is one of
[1:24:15] the most times of mockery
[1:24:17] that there's ever been with the coming
[1:24:20] of the lord the bible said that scoffers
[1:24:22] shall arise saying where is the sign of
[1:24:24] his coming
[1:24:26] and brother branham when he preaches the
[1:24:28] rapture message
[1:24:30] his the first half of his sermon is on
[1:24:32] the scoffers
[1:24:35] amen so don't think you're going to get
[1:24:38] by this
[1:24:38] unscathed that you're not scoffed at
[1:24:42] and mocked and ridiculed
[1:24:45] don't think young people that you can go
[1:24:47] through this and not be
[1:24:49] ridiculed and made fun of and called
[1:24:51] old-fashioned or whatever word
[1:24:53] you're just not cool or whatever word
[1:24:55] there is
[1:24:57] are you with me it's part of the coming
[1:25:01] and living in this day when you see the
[1:25:04] mockery now
[1:25:05] that's even made against the message of
[1:25:07] the hour understand
[1:25:08] it's part of the rapture message there
[1:25:12] has to be scoffers in place just like
[1:25:15] there had to be sodomites in the days
[1:25:17] of lot
[1:25:22] these people each one have their place
[1:25:25] and they are finding their places
[1:25:28] some are finding their places as
[1:25:30] sodomites
[1:25:31] some are planting their places lord i'd
[1:25:33] see you know just good people lukewarm
[1:25:35] believers
[1:25:36] but some people are abraham's
[1:25:42] some people the mysteries have been
[1:25:44] revealed too
[1:25:46] some people have been told they're going
[1:25:48] to receive the promised son
[1:25:50] that's their message they're under
[1:25:54] expectation
[1:25:55] and some of those people are looking for
[1:25:58] the angel
[1:25:59] to come again
[1:26:02] come on sarah i will return to you
[1:26:05] according to the time of life
[1:26:08] amen we ought to be today in this
[1:26:11] building looking for the angel's
[1:26:12] appearance
[1:26:15] amen to tell us the time is here
[1:26:18] that we are in the hour we are in the
[1:26:20] time
[1:26:22] think of that but these others mocking
[1:26:25] saying these are drunk
[1:26:27] and peter stood up and words came out of
[1:26:29] his mouth
[1:26:31] amen some of these words were scriptures
[1:26:34] and these scriptures became anointed
[1:26:36] remember remember we're looking at
[1:26:39] something with a
[1:26:40] transformation here adam comes way back
[1:26:43] at the beginning
[1:26:44] he's made to be the god of the earth he
[1:26:46] has everything under his control
[1:26:48] everything is under his dominion by
[1:26:51] words
[1:26:53] he spoke and it happened he said let
[1:26:56] there be and it was
[1:26:58] he moved this tree by his words
[1:27:01] not sweat of the brow that came with the
[1:27:03] curse amen but with words
[1:27:07] somebody with me now amen and you don't
[1:27:10] think
[1:27:10] your words mean anything
[1:27:14] and you don't think your words don't
[1:27:16] have power
[1:27:19] hello somebody and here comes
[1:27:22] here comes the first thing that happens

[1:27:32] they're declaring the wonderful
[1:27:34] miraculous power
[1:27:36] and works of god and then
[1:27:40] others begin to mock and and say how can
[1:27:43] this be they're
[1:27:44] drunk on wine an old crowd had gathered
[1:27:46] and peter said
[1:27:48] you know these people are not drunk as
[1:27:49] you're supposed this is only nine
[1:27:51] o'clock in the morning
[1:27:54] amen no but this is that which was
[1:27:56] spoken by the prophet joel
[1:27:59] somebody with me now amen now what is it
[1:28:02] the light
[1:28:03] of that fire began to illuminate
[1:28:07] scripture
[1:28:08] and peter could say this day this
[1:28:11] scripture
[1:28:12] is fulfilled he can say this is where
[1:28:16] we're standing
[1:28:20] we're right here at joel's prophecy amen
[1:28:24] this is
[1:28:25] that in the last days saith god how many
[1:28:27] believes were in the last days
[1:28:30] and my brother branham would say these
[1:28:32] last days would cover 2000 years

[1:28:37] amen in the last days says
[1:28:39] god says i will pour out my spirit on
[1:28:42] all people

[1:28:50] jewish people
[1:28:51] but it ends up on all people
[1:28:55] is that right amen your sons and your
[1:28:58] daughters shall prophesy

[1:29:33] words that declare he's a miraculous
[1:29:36] almighty
[1:29:37] unchanging god words
[1:29:44] amen he would quote also from the psalms
[1:29:48] a couple of places
[1:29:49] to give scriptural proof of the
[1:29:52] resurrection
[1:29:53] of the messiah as the light of that fire
[1:29:56] began to give these scriptures
[1:29:58] their true meaning
[1:30:01] understand they had been misinterpreted
[1:30:04] for years and years and years
[1:30:07] but now it when the spirit came
[1:30:11] when the anointing came when the fire
[1:30:14] fell it illuminated the word
[1:30:20] amen oh my then he would then he would
[1:30:23] talk about the messiah
[1:30:25] and point him in the scripture and he
[1:30:27] said therefore my heart is glad and
[1:30:29] my tongue rejoices and my body also

[1:33:13] scroll down here and find it but i've
[1:33:15] got a
[1:33:15] little quotation where brother madam
[1:33:17] talks about that
[1:33:19] let me just we'll just pick it up as we
[1:33:21] go but anyway
[1:33:23] as we're talking about this here here
[1:33:26] he's
[1:33:27] he is saying you know what you're seeing
[1:33:30] is not drunk men but you're seeing
[1:33:34] men who are who are anointed
[1:33:39] and filled and intoxicated
[1:33:42] with another spirit it ain't the spirit
[1:33:46] of wine
[1:33:47] it's the spirit of the god it's the holy
[1:33:50] ghost
[1:33:51] and it's anointing you hallelujah
[1:33:55] oh listen to me listen to this as he as
[1:33:58] as peter began to say these
[1:34:01] supernaturally inspired words
[1:34:05] these he's speaking life changing
[1:34:08] words
[1:34:12] life empowering words
[1:34:16] words that was received in the heart
[1:34:19] will change that heart
[1:34:20] forever peter speaking with these
[1:34:24] words
[1:34:28] it was not only that the beam of that
[1:34:31] fire was beaming or shining its light
[1:34:35] upon men but now
[1:34:36] it gives inspiration to a preacher
[1:34:41] is that right and peter began to preach
[1:34:45] and the light of that pillar of fire
[1:34:47] shown upon the scripture
[1:34:50] that it lay dormant for ages and
[1:34:53] revelation came to scripture that was
[1:34:56] being fulfilled in that hour
[1:35:01] and he said what you're seeing is not
[1:35:03] drunk men
[1:35:04] men under influence are intoxicated but
[1:35:07] rather
[1:35:07] men uh that where that are received the
[1:35:12] pouring out
[1:35:13] of the spirit of jesus whom you have
[1:35:15] crucified and who has ascended
[1:35:17] and he's poured out his spirit upon all
[1:35:19] flesh
[1:35:22] and he would describe him you know he
[1:35:24] said david said
[1:35:25] he would god would not leave him a
[1:35:27] descendant that didn't sit on the throne
[1:35:29] and he said here christ has ascended and
[1:35:32] he send it to the right hand of god and
[1:35:34] he reigns and he sent back his spirit
[1:35:38] in verse 29 he would tell them about
[1:35:40] this he said
[1:35:42] you know fellow israelites i can tell
[1:35:44] you this confidentially
[1:35:46] that this patriarch david died and was
[1:35:48] buried and his tomb is with us to this
[1:35:50] day
[1:35:51] but he swore with an oath god swore to
[1:35:53] him with the oath
[1:35:54] that there would that he would place one
[1:35:57] of his descendants
[1:35:58] upon his throne and he said
[1:36:02] seeing what was coming he spoke of the
[1:36:04] resurrection
[1:36:06] and the messiah that he was not going to
[1:36:08] abandon his body
[1:36:10] in the realm of the dead or neither
[1:36:12] would he see his body decay
[1:36:14] and he says god has raised up jesus to
[1:36:17] life
[1:36:17] and we're all witnesses of it he exalted
[1:36:20] him to the right hand of god
[1:36:21] and he's received from the father the
[1:36:24] promise of the holy spirit
[1:36:25] and he's poured it out upon you and
[1:36:27] that's what you're seeing and hearing
[1:36:31] for he said david had not ascended to
[1:36:32] heaven yet he said the lord said to my
[1:36:34] lord sit in my right hand till i make
[1:36:36] your enemies a footstool for your
[1:36:38] feet therefore let all israel be assured
[1:36:41] of this that god has made this jesus
[1:36:43] whom you crucified
[1:36:44] both the lord and christ
[1:36:47] now as christ the messiah he's pouring
[1:36:51] out his spirit
[1:36:53] he's pouring it out from his throne on
[1:36:55] high
[1:36:56] his own holy spirit i want you to get
[1:36:58] this not a second person
[1:37:00] not a third person the but the very
[1:37:03] spirit the very
[1:37:04] life of jesus is being poured out
[1:37:08] the very character of jesus is being
[1:37:11] poured out and it
[1:37:13] fills every one of those with the holy
[1:37:16] spirit
[1:37:17] and as the bible said that they were
[1:37:20] there they begin to
[1:37:21] testify or witness they begin to speak
[1:37:25] of the wonderful works of god
[1:37:29] this is what the holy ghost will do
[1:37:32] people look for this evidence for that
[1:37:34] evidence let me tell you
[1:37:36] what it will do it will cause your life
[1:37:39] it will speak out of your life the
[1:37:42] wonderful
[1:37:43] works of god he's my healer he's my
[1:37:48] deliverer
[1:37:49] he's my savior i once was lost in sin
[1:37:52] i was a smoker i was a drunkard i was a
[1:37:55] doper
[1:37:56] i was a thief that's what i was but
[1:37:58] that's not what i
[1:38:00] am because a miracle has taken place
[1:38:03] and has changed me from death into life
[1:38:11] no more will it tell the awful deeds
[1:38:14] of deniers betrayers liars
[1:38:18] thieves dopers adulterers
[1:38:22] smokers or drinkers
[1:38:25] but rather the life will tell the
[1:38:28] wonderful
[1:38:29] works of god
[1:38:35] this spirit will not display
[1:38:38] intellectual voices and words of man it
[1:38:42] will not spout out
[1:38:44] the egotism of man i came from baylor
[1:38:47] from bob
[1:38:47] jones i learned this from the upci
[1:38:51] i got this from the assembly of god but
[1:38:53] rather
[1:38:54] men that are ignorant and unlearned like
[1:38:57] peter the fisherman was
[1:38:59] was that he would have the scripture
[1:39:01] illuminated to him
[1:39:03] so much that others had known would know
[1:39:06] this
[1:39:06] man had been with jesus
[1:39:10] and let me tell you it was not it would
[1:39:11] not be a dry
[1:39:13] lecture i don't know where we get it in
[1:39:17] the message
[1:39:19] you know a rise of these dry
[1:39:22] lectures people men that never know the
[1:39:25] anointing
[1:39:26] never know the moving of the spirit of
[1:39:29] god
[1:39:31] you see that's not what was on the day
[1:39:34] of pentecost
[1:39:35] that's not what happened anywhere you
[1:39:38] know
[1:39:39] again an anointed preacher
[1:39:42] why a few days after this he was at they
[1:39:46] were at the temple gate
[1:39:48] and they saw a very broken piece of
[1:39:52] humanity a man who was born with a birth
[1:39:55] defect
[1:39:56] with club feet his feet and his ankle
[1:40:00] bones were
[1:40:01] so weak and twisted that he was
[1:40:03] hideously and
[1:40:04] hopelessly crippled
[1:40:08] he was born that way and he was
[1:40:10] considered accursed
[1:40:13] it was thought that a person who had
[1:40:15] afflictions like these were
[1:40:17] or were cursed with a generational curse
[1:40:20] because of some sin that his mom and dad
[1:40:23] did or his grandparents did or his
[1:40:25] great-grandparents did
[1:40:27] and he lived under that i'm cursed
[1:40:31] i'm rejected i'll always be
[1:40:35] you know an eyesore something different
[1:40:38] something's wrong he existed on begging
[1:40:42] and asking arms of everybody to come by
[1:40:47] and and that day when
[1:40:50] when peter and james where john
[1:40:53] peter and john would come into to the
[1:40:55] gate called beautiful
[1:40:56] let me tell you something friend
[1:40:58] suddenly
[1:41:01] this man's life was about to be changed
[1:41:03] forever
[1:41:06] again suddenly they came from heaven a
[1:41:08] sound
[1:41:10] like a rusty mighty wind suddenly
[1:41:14] the lord will come sadly
[1:41:17] here we are in a day in a time where
[1:41:19] things are happening quickly
[1:41:21] quickly suddenly and suddenly
[1:41:25] here he is and he's standing in front of
[1:41:27] not just
[1:41:28] men but god men
[1:41:33] amen come on church you've never seen
[1:41:36] men like this
[1:41:38] because there'd never be a man like this
[1:41:41] there had been a man
[1:41:42] like this his name was jesus but now
[1:41:44] there were men like this
[1:41:48] amen this was not a man anointed this
[1:41:51] was a man
[1:41:51] who the spirit bowed in
[1:41:56] this was a man that power would come out
[1:41:59] of his mouth
[1:42:02] somebody help me preach amen and heal
[1:42:06] he he he asked he held out of his hand
[1:42:09] asking for silver or gold for alms for
[1:42:13] money ask for something
[1:42:17] and peter said to him we can only give
[1:42:20] people what we have
[1:42:25] come on some of you missed it went right
[1:42:28] over your head
[1:42:29] amen so we peter said we can only give
[1:42:32] you what we got
[1:42:35] amen he couldn't give him silver and
[1:42:37] gold he didn't have any
[1:42:39] but he had something and he said i can
[1:42:42] only give you what we got
[1:42:45] amen and i just want to say to the
[1:42:46] church you can't give people what you
[1:42:48] don't have

[1:42:59] you can't give divine healing if you
[1:43:01] don't have it
[1:43:03] hey man you can't give joy if you don't

[1:43:14] hallelujah they know that joy they know
[1:43:17] that peace
[1:43:18] they know the healer and the healer
[1:43:21] isn't somebody that comes down once in a
[1:43:23] while
[1:43:23] the healer abides with him
[1:43:26] [Applause]
[1:43:32] they had something to give
[1:43:35] and the last day church has to be
[1:43:38] standing in the place in the position
[1:43:40] they have something to give
[1:43:45] too many churches are bankrupt too many
[1:43:48] christians are bankrupt
[1:43:53] amen
[1:43:56] but but peter had something and he looks
[1:43:59] at him and said
[1:44:00] we can only give you what we got
[1:44:04] now a few days before that they didn't
[1:44:06] have anything to give
[1:44:10] but now after receiving what they had
[1:44:12] received they had something to give
[1:44:16] how many's got the holy ghost this
[1:44:17] morning you got something to give
[1:44:21] don't hide it under a bushel don't be
[1:44:24] ashamed of it
[1:44:25] don't run scared of it you got something
[1:44:27] to give
[1:44:28] [Applause]
[1:44:30] amen it can change lives
[1:44:34] it can speak inspired words
[1:44:38] it can speak words of healing and life
[1:44:44] peter reached down and just helped him
[1:44:47] to his feet and said rise up
[1:44:49] and i want you to know using the power
[1:44:53] of creative restorative
[1:44:57] spoken word
[1:45:01] peter commanded him to rise up and walk
[1:45:06] and there was snaps and crackles and
[1:45:09] popping
[1:45:10] as his ankle bombs and his feet became
[1:45:12] straight
[1:45:13] and the bible said he went leaping and
[1:45:16] jumping and praising god
[1:45:21] amen oh god delivers from a bankrupt
[1:45:24] church
[1:45:26] amen you know today we can give silver
[1:45:30] and gold we'll help you with your
[1:45:31] hospital we'll do this we'll do this
[1:45:33] we'll do this we'll do this we can
[1:45:34] pull out we'll you know and the church
[1:45:36] has done that
[1:45:41] the catholic church has got saint jude's
[1:45:44] the methodist church has got lots of
[1:45:46] different hospitals
[1:45:48] including willis knighton there in in
[1:45:51] shreveport
[1:45:52] catholic church has got church has got
[1:45:55] has got hospitals everywhere
[1:45:58] that's what they have to give yes
[1:46:01] but the real church has got to have
[1:46:04] something real to give
[1:46:10] amen listen and he said
[1:46:13] rise up and use creative
[1:46:16] words look these
[1:46:19] were the this was the same power that
[1:46:22] adam used
[1:46:23] before the fall
[1:46:26] the same power is somebody with me
[1:46:29] the word operating with the same power
[1:46:33] that adam would say to this tree be
[1:46:36] plucked up and moved over there
[1:46:38] or he would call the animals down and
[1:46:41] bring peace
[1:46:42] or perhaps he would as in his rule he
[1:46:44] would rule
[1:46:45] and tell the wind peace be still
[1:46:51] but now here's a son of god
[1:46:55] and he's got creative words in his mouth
[1:47:01] and using the power of that creative
[1:47:04] restorative
[1:47:05] word he says to a crippled man
[1:47:10] who is hideously hopelessly crippled
[1:47:15] who has no faith
[1:47:20] but peter's got some because he's not
[1:47:23] bankrupt
[1:47:26] again god give us a church in this end
[1:47:29] time that's not bankrupt
[1:47:32] they got plenty of faith they believe
[1:47:34] god's word
[1:47:36] they put it to test they see it work
[1:47:39] is somebody with me amen so you would
[1:47:42] say i don't have peter i'm peter i don't
[1:47:44] have
[1:47:45] silver gold but what i do have i give
[1:47:48] you
[1:47:49] in the name of jesus christ and taking
[1:47:52] him by the right hand he helps him up
[1:47:54] and instantly his feet are and ankles
[1:47:58] become strong and
[1:47:59] he comes jumping and leaping and
[1:48:02] praising god and when the people saw him
[1:48:04] doing this they
[1:48:05] recognized him as the man
[1:48:09] who had sat at the gate and they were
[1:48:12] filled with wonder and amazement at what
[1:48:14] had happened to him
[1:48:15] and they all gathered at him and peter
[1:48:17] said my friends why do you gaze at us
[1:48:20] as if we had the power to do this why
[1:48:22] does this even surprise you
[1:48:24] why do you stare at us like it's our own
[1:48:26] power or godliness that made this man
[1:48:29] walk
[1:48:30] by faith in the name of jesus
[1:48:35] this man who you see was made strong
[1:48:38] it is jesus name and faith that comes
[1:48:41] through him
[1:48:42] that has completely healed him as you
[1:48:44] can all see
[1:48:47] and then peter began to tell them but
[1:48:50] this is not just
[1:48:51] for us
[1:48:56] amen it's for everybody
[1:48:59] who will receive it you can be
[1:49:02] transformed
[1:49:03] by the renewing of your mind amen you
[1:49:06] can become a
[1:49:07] son of god a daughter of god
[1:49:10] amen and he said he and he he began to
[1:49:13] preach to them
[1:49:14] of how god had sent jesus and they had
[1:49:17] crucified him
[1:49:18] and rejected him and then in verse 19 he
[1:49:21] says
[1:49:22] repent you therefore and be converted
[1:49:24] that your sins may be blotted out
[1:49:27] when the times of refreshing shall come
[1:49:29] from the presence of the lord
[1:49:32] amen so repent and turn to god
[1:49:35] that's what converted me turn to god
[1:49:39] turn around turn to god so your sins may
[1:49:43] be
[1:49:44] wiped out annihilated dipped in blood
[1:49:49] let the bleach take care of it wipe
[1:49:52] every molecule of sin
[1:49:53] until it changes until it lands back on
[1:49:56] the head of the accuser
[1:49:59] come on somebody amen until your sins
[1:50:02] may be
[1:50:03] blotted out when the times of refreshing
[1:50:08] the times of refreshing may come
[1:50:11] from the lord
[1:50:17] times of refreshing
[1:50:21] the way you prepare for it is you
[1:50:24] prepare it for it by
[1:50:26] repentance by turning to god
[1:50:30] by seeking him with your whole heart
[1:50:34] come on remember where we was talking
[1:50:37] about
[1:50:38] a while ago amen getting in that one
[1:50:40] accord
[1:50:42] get your mind on one thing i've got to
[1:50:43] have this one thing
[1:50:45] i must have jesus amen
[1:50:48] you know i'm sorry we cannot give you
[1:50:51] jesus
[1:50:52] magically he comes in your heart when
[1:50:54] you repent
[1:50:56] when you surrender when you yield to the
[1:50:59] holy spirit
[1:51:00] when you invite him into your life
[1:51:01] that's when he'll come
[1:51:03] amen notice when times of refreshing
[1:51:07] may come from the presence of the lord
[1:51:09] you know we can expect that
[1:51:11] every service
[1:51:14] we can expect that every day
[1:51:18] we can expect that every hour
[1:51:21] times of refreshing to come from the
[1:51:24] presence of the lord
[1:51:26] oh my the holy ghost is that refreshing
[1:51:29] amen oh my it is the rest
[1:51:33] how many knows it in the bible that that
[1:51:35] god set aside a day for a man to rest
[1:51:39] sure he did he also said an order
[1:51:42] that every male of the of the children
[1:51:45] of israel must be
[1:51:46] circumcised
[1:51:51] yeah it was to be a sign in the flesh
[1:51:53] that that seed
[1:51:54] the issue from that from that man was
[1:51:57] claimed by god as his people
[1:52:01] are you with me amen but we don't
[1:52:04] practice circumcision today do we
[1:52:07] you know why because we got a new
[1:52:09] circumcision
[1:52:11] a greater one it's a circumcision of the
[1:52:14] heart
[1:52:14] that cuts off the flesh but
[1:52:18] every male every person every man or
[1:52:20] woman
[1:52:21] who is not circumcised will perish
[1:52:26] that will be cut off
[1:52:30] you know i was reading in the bible when
[1:52:32] god gave this to abraham the other
[1:52:34] the other day i was reading i believe he
[1:52:35] was i believe he was 90
[1:52:39] 99 years old something like that israel
[1:52:42] was 12.
[1:52:46] this may be a little carnal but that
[1:52:48] hurt
[1:52:54] and i'm just going to say to you the
[1:52:56] longer you wait
[1:52:59] the more it's going to hurt
[1:53:06] somebody with me amen so surrender now
[1:53:13] surrender now amen you know you cover
[1:53:17] that this was to be a covenant with god
[1:53:20] where god was claiming and it you know
[1:53:22] it wasn't somebody ever
[1:53:23] that something everybody could see and
[1:53:25] neither is it in
[1:53:27] you it's something in the heart and
[1:53:28] everybody can't see it
[1:53:31] but god knows amen and everyone that
[1:53:34] don't receive it is cut off
[1:53:38] among his people is that right amen now
[1:53:41] there was a sabbath day it was a rest
[1:53:43] day
[1:53:44] of course man made it into law he made
[1:53:47] it to so strict until it became
[1:53:49] burdensome to bear
[1:53:50] it was made to give them a nice day of
[1:53:53] rest
[1:53:54] and they made it impossible when i went
[1:53:57] to israel
[1:53:58] a few years ago you know they had they
[1:54:01] had
[1:54:02] um with their elevators they had um
[1:54:06] the fast elevators had another elevator
[1:54:09] and on the sabbath day it
[1:54:12] it was programmed to stop at every floor
[1:54:17] so if you had ten floors to to climb
[1:54:20] you went one door open
[1:54:23] two door open three door open close
[1:54:27] four and you waited all that time
[1:54:31] because you couldn't dare push a button
[1:54:39] it would be sin to push a button
[1:54:43] and they made it things impossible
[1:54:50] god gave it to them and they actually
[1:54:53] crucified jesus
[1:54:57] over their ideas
[1:55:01] come on oh yeah
[1:55:04] a crucified jesus over
[1:55:07] over their legalism legalism will cause
[1:55:10] you to crucify
[1:55:11] jesus legalism
[1:55:15] of your do's and don'ts and everything's
[1:55:17] got to be just this way in this way this
[1:55:19] way and this way
[1:55:20] will cause you to reject the messiah
[1:55:26] it's only when you come into grace yes
[1:55:30] amen where it's no longer law there's
[1:55:33] somebody with me now
[1:55:35] but i want you to understand that that
[1:55:37] this was
[1:55:38] this time of refreshing would be a rest
[1:55:44] and it would replace the sabbath rest
[1:55:46] now there's people that still
[1:55:48] worship on saturday and they go to
[1:55:50] church on you know we
[1:55:51] we had a many years ago i um
[1:55:54] i used to show goats and and there was a
[1:55:58] lady orthodontist
[1:55:59] seventh day adventist and and uh you
[1:56:01] know she
[1:56:03] she uh was um uh she was a
[1:56:06] go on goats and was showing showing them
[1:56:09] at the place but she was seventh day
[1:56:11] adventist a sabbatarian
[1:56:13] and you know i i didn't show goats on
[1:56:16] sunday i'd pack up and go home well
[1:56:18] it convicted her so well i'm not going
[1:56:20] to show goats on saturday
[1:56:22] because that's the true sabbath and
[1:56:25] there i look at her
[1:56:27] with short hair painted halter top and
[1:56:29] shorts
[1:56:30] you know paint paint everywhere and i'm
[1:56:34] and i'm looking at her and she's trying
[1:56:36] to be holy
[1:56:38] she's trying to do something here you
[1:56:40] know where she gonna
[1:56:41] she gonna worship on saturday
[1:56:45] and and here here that
[1:56:48] was a type just like circumcision
[1:56:51] that had already been fulfilled
[1:56:55] because when you receive the holy ghost
[1:56:57] you enter into a
[1:56:59] sabbath rest you're no longer working
[1:57:02] for your salvation
[1:57:05] you don't have to struggle i i could
[1:57:07] just quit this
[1:57:08] or if i can quit that or if i can quit
[1:57:10] smoking if i can quit drinking
[1:57:12] if i if i could just quit you know i you
[1:57:15] know i want to but i can't i
[1:57:17] this is so aggravating you know what i
[1:57:19] have to stop at every floor
[1:57:21] you know all it all just vanishes away
[1:57:24] when you get the holy ghost
[1:57:25] you enter into a rest
[1:57:29] and you rest from your labors as god
[1:57:33] did from his and it brings a time
[1:57:36] of refreshing from the presence of the
[1:57:39] lord
[1:57:41] hallelujah and it's refreshing and many
[1:57:44] refreshing
[1:57:45] and every day is a refreshing because
[1:57:47] every day you're in a sabbath rest
[1:57:51] no more a slave to sin no more slave to
[1:57:54] fear
[1:57:55] no more slave unbelief you're free
[1:58:00] the bible said in isaiah 28 9
[1:58:04] whom shall he teach knowledge and whom
[1:58:07] shall he make to
[1:58:08] understand doctrine them that are weaned
[1:58:10] from the milk and drawn from the breast
[1:58:12] for precept must be upon precept and
[1:58:15] preceptive on precept
[1:58:16] line up online line up a line here
[1:58:18] little their little four with
[1:58:19] tamarind lips and another tongue will he
[1:58:23] speak
[1:58:23] to his people to whom he said this
[1:58:26] is the rest wherewith ye may cause the
[1:58:30] weary to rest
[1:58:31] and this is refreshing yet they were not
[1:58:33] here now he's speaking of israel
[1:58:36] now if you look at it on one side here
[1:58:38] he took and he said okay
[1:58:40] you won't let the land rest you won't
[1:58:43] honor
[1:58:43] things that i have put into place i tell
[1:58:46] you what i'm going to make it rest
[1:58:48] i'm going to take a strange tongue and a
[1:58:51] strange people
[1:58:52] they're going to carry you away captive
[1:58:54] into babylon
[1:58:56] and i'll give the land rest the sabbath
[1:58:59] rest i there will be a rest
[1:59:02] and and so he carried them away but they
[1:59:04] still wasn't here
[1:59:06] so one side that's the old testament and
[1:59:09] the application there but in this
[1:59:11] notice this whom shall he teach
[1:59:13] knowledge
[1:59:15] to whom shall he give the wisdom oh he
[1:59:18] said them that are weaned from the uh
[1:59:20] and made to understand doctrine them
[1:59:22] that are weaned from the milk
[1:59:23] and drawn from the breasts and he said
[1:59:26] precept must be up on precept line up
[1:59:27] online
[1:59:28] hear a little but i tell you with
[1:59:30] stammering lips
[1:59:32] and other tongues will i speak to this
[1:59:36] people
[1:59:37] this is something brother branham
[1:59:39] preached and used about the holy ghost
[1:59:41] all the way to the end of his ministry
[1:59:43] you hardly hear it preached anymore but
[1:59:45] this is exactly the scripture he would
[1:59:47] go to
[1:59:48] he said with stammering lips and other
[1:59:50] tongue i will will he speak to this
[1:59:52] people to whom he said
[1:59:54] this is the rest wherewith you may cause
[1:59:57] the weary to rest
[1:59:58] and this is the refreshing amen
[2:00:04] yet i believe there's a people here that
[2:00:06] are here
[2:00:07] what the spirit is saying though the
[2:00:10] world will not receive it
[2:00:12] amen there's somebody going to listen
[2:00:15] amen when a church like this
[2:00:17] exists like this sin cannot stay in its
[2:00:20] midst
[2:00:24] amen not only is sin exposed but it's
[2:00:27] dealt with
[2:00:28] and is called out by the holy ghost
[2:00:32] amen this was a church in this indus
[2:00:35] in his purity listen to children we're
[2:00:37] living in a time where the devil is
[2:00:39] going about like a roaring lion
[2:00:42] amen looking for someone to devour
[2:00:44] you're to resist him
[2:00:49] did you hear those words you are to
[2:00:50] resist him
[2:00:53] you hear the things you see the things
[2:00:54] you know that are going on
[2:00:56] look at it it's there it's on your phone
[2:00:58] it's there on your computer it's
[2:01:00] there in the streets it's everywhere
[2:01:03] come on amen the devil is there prowls
[2:01:06] about like a roaring lion
[2:01:08] seeking those whom he may devour but
[2:01:10] resist him
[2:01:12] stand strong in the faith because you
[2:01:15] know the family of believers throughout
[2:01:17] the world is undergoing the same kind of
[2:01:19] sufferings amen
[2:01:23] but look in that early church
[2:01:26] here they walk out of that upper room
[2:01:28] now here are men
[2:01:30] empowered like adam they are
[2:01:33] changing things are changing things are
[2:01:35] happening
[2:01:38] and they're walking out see a man with
[2:01:40] crippled
[2:01:42] they're declaring the mighty works of
[2:01:44] god
[2:01:45] and among them the devil tries to enter
[2:01:48] in
[2:01:52] and the bible tells you that when they
[2:01:55] had gathered
[2:01:56] all the believers were in one heart
[2:01:59] and one mind
[2:02:03] in fact the matter is they were a loving
[2:02:06] giving
[2:02:06] caring bunch of people it wasn't all
[2:02:10] about me
[2:02:11] and mine and our survival but they were
[2:02:13] also
[2:02:14] interested in the needs of others
[2:02:18] and they shared everything that they had
[2:02:20] and i'm not talking about a forced
[2:02:22] communism in a church
[2:02:25] or a cult movement i'm talking about the
[2:02:27] holy ghost
[2:02:29] leading every heart and having a genuine
[2:02:31] love and concern
[2:02:32] for one another amen
[2:02:35] and and so again the bible tells us
[2:02:39] that with great power the apostles
[2:02:42] continue to minister and testify of the
[2:02:45] resurrection of jesus christ
[2:02:48] and the god's grace was so powerfully at
[2:02:51] work
[2:02:52] among them all and and there was no
[2:02:54] needy people among them because
[2:02:57] from time to time those that had houses
[2:02:59] or land that would
[2:03:00] they they would sell them and they would
[2:03:03] bring their
[2:03:04] money from the sales laid at the
[2:03:06] apostles feet
[2:03:07] there was a i'm just simply saying there
[2:03:09] was a care
[2:03:10] and a love for one another a concern
[2:03:13] about the needs
[2:03:14] of others are you with me even joseph a
[2:03:18] a levite from cyprus that this
[2:03:20] the apostles called barnabas which means
[2:03:23] son of encouragement he sold a field
[2:03:25] that he owned
[2:03:26] and he brought the money and he laid it
[2:03:28] at the apostles feet
[2:03:31] there was no big ones or no little ones
[2:03:36] such a love and genuine concern for
[2:03:38] others
[2:03:41] what is mine is now ours
[2:03:44] and if there was a need there would be
[2:03:46] someone just sell a possession
[2:03:48] put it at the apostles feet there must
[2:03:51] have been a real sense among them
[2:03:54] that we're leaving for the rapture is
[2:03:57] imminent and we won't even need this
[2:04:03] now brother branham said it was actually
[2:04:05] the working the acts of the holy spirit
[2:04:07] he said anointed him that way he said
[2:04:09] because when the persecution came they
[2:04:11] had no place to
[2:04:12] to to go and shelter and they went out
[2:04:15] to the world and dispersed the gospel
[2:04:17] everywhere
[2:04:20] you see we get it in our minds
[2:04:24] that we are to store up provide for
[2:04:27] ourselves
[2:04:28] but when is when your mind's on the
[2:04:30] coming of the lord
[2:04:31] it isn't about you anymore
[2:04:34] it isn't about what we're going to
[2:04:37] possess here
[2:04:38] it's about one focus let's get ready to
[2:04:42] leave
[2:04:44] this is what i'm talking about where are
[2:04:46] we standing now
[2:04:48] we're at the culmination of the ages
[2:04:51] you say brother tim they weren't looking
[2:04:53] for the coming lord oh yes it was
[2:04:54] because
[2:04:55] even paul said you know beloved i'll
[2:04:57] show you a mystery
[2:04:59] amount he would say in first
[2:05:00] thessalonians 4 he said you know
[2:05:03] concerning those who are asleep i
[2:05:04] wouldn't just sorrow not for the lord
[2:05:06] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[2:05:08] shout
[2:05:09] with the voice of an archangel with the
[2:05:10] trump of god and we
[2:05:12] we that are alive and remain shall be
[2:05:13] changed to be like them
[2:05:16] is that right amen this was the cry this
[2:05:19] was the crux this was their message
[2:05:22] and i want to just say to you they could
[2:05:24] have been raptured
[2:05:28] they were they were a seed church
[2:05:31] and they could have been taken in the
[2:05:33] garner
[2:05:34] but god had other names on the book
[2:05:38] that had not been manifested on the
[2:05:40] earth
[2:05:41] and so instead of taking them in the
[2:05:43] gardener he planted them
[2:05:46] and they come up through luther and
[2:05:48] wesley and all the way back but i want
[2:05:49] to tell you
[2:05:50] we're about to see it again and behold i
[2:05:54] show you a mystery amen this is no
[2:05:57] longer a mystery
[2:05:58] this is a day of fulfillment this is a
[2:06:02] day where
[2:06:02] rapture is happening amen the word has
[2:06:06] come to a prophet
[2:06:07] as the lord descends with a shout with a
[2:06:10] message
[2:06:10] and a message came to a prophet of god
[2:06:13] and from that message it took flesh
[2:06:15] in the lives and hearts of the people
[2:06:19] and i'm talking to a living walking
[2:06:22] talking
[2:06:22] pride of people that's got something to
[2:06:25] say
[2:06:26] of the people that's got power in their
[2:06:29] words of people who know their god
[2:06:44] they didn't care about possessions
[2:06:48] they were writing songs and i cannot
[2:06:52] feel at home in this world
[2:06:56] anymore all
[2:06:59] of god is leaving on my mind
[2:07:05] he's coming soon
[2:07:09] he's coming soon and with joy
[2:07:13] we welcome his returning
[2:07:23] oh our lord is coming back to earth
[2:07:26] again
[2:07:28] and this became to be the cry of their
[2:07:30] heart
[2:07:32] come i don't want to be in a service you
[2:07:35] don't come jesus
[2:07:38] who wants to be in a church where jesus
[2:07:40] didn't come
[2:07:44] come on but one
[2:07:48] ananias and sapphira
[2:07:51] conspired against the lord
[2:07:56] they sold their property and kept back
[2:07:58] some just in case this new religion
[2:08:00] didn't work out
[2:08:03] you know it was their land they weren't
[2:08:05] required to give the sale of it
[2:08:06] they could have kept back they could
[2:08:09] keep back any part of it for themselves
[2:08:12] but they made a pretense
[2:08:17] of giving all
[2:08:20] how many times have we dealt with this
[2:08:23] kind of thing
[2:08:24] down through our walk people
[2:08:28] who made a pretense of having
[2:08:31] surrendered
[2:08:34] all
[2:08:37] they pretend
[2:08:41] and they pretended you know that they
[2:08:43] had given
[2:08:45] everything and thus in their deeds
[2:08:48] they lied to the holy ghost
[2:08:52] and god judged them for it
[2:08:58] you know there in that early church god
[2:09:02] laid the bodies of ananias sapphira
[2:09:05] in the path of every hypocrite
[2:09:08] who would seek to enter the church
[2:09:14] and here was people walking to the
[2:09:16] church now listen this is
[2:09:17] hardly any different from when they went
[2:09:20] into the new land here they come in the
[2:09:22] new land of the holy ghost
[2:09:24] and they're walking right now into the
[2:09:26] new land
[2:09:28] of the holy ghost the apostles were just
[2:09:31] like
[2:09:32] hundreds of years before israel had
[2:09:35] walked into a new land
[2:09:40] and here in this new land they were
[2:09:42] devoting everything to god
[2:09:46] you know what happened to the time
[2:09:49] where the church used to when the people
[2:09:51] of god used to devote
[2:09:52] everything their time
[2:09:57] yeah you know don't don't get in your
[2:09:59] mind at all i'm trying to get your money
[2:10:01] in your pocketbook
[2:10:03] i'm not worried i'm i'm not even
[2:10:04] concerned about that but
[2:10:06] what about it today
[2:10:09] they you know again where where
[2:10:11] christians used to
[2:10:13] have something they would pray all night
[2:10:16] they would call on god
[2:10:17] they'd make a full surrender of
[2:10:19] everything
[2:10:22] is somebody with me and here israel they
[2:10:25] go into the land
[2:10:26] and they devote everything they devote
[2:10:29] everything at jericho to god
[2:10:32] they declared it all holy and everything
[2:10:35] all the spoils would be would be given
[2:10:37] to god
[2:10:42] and achan and achan
[2:10:47] saw a babylonian garment
[2:10:50] and a wedge of gold and he caused israel
[2:10:54] to miserably fail
[2:10:58] somebody with me now now we come into
[2:11:02] the new land
[2:11:04] we come into the new land
[2:11:08] and then this new land the holy ghost is
[2:11:11] moving
[2:11:12] healings are taking place miracles are
[2:11:16] happening
[2:11:17] people are being filled with deity
[2:11:21] and in the midst satan puts in the heart
[2:11:24] here comes the devil coming in and here
[2:11:27] comes a hypocrite
[2:11:30] hypocrite it's
[2:11:33] kind of a bad word today you know we use
[2:11:36] it ah that's a hypocrite
[2:11:38] hypocrite in that day it was just an
[2:11:40] actor
[2:11:42] it was a greek word common name for an
[2:11:44] actor just like we say this actor or
[2:11:46] actress
[2:11:47] played on this movie or what this was a
[2:11:49] hypocrite hypocrite was
[2:11:51] an actor and jesus began to call them
[2:11:55] pharisees and sadducees you're just
[2:11:57] actors
[2:12:00] that's all you are is acting and they
[2:12:02] get in the new church now
[2:12:04] and i want you to know here the these
[2:12:06] make a
[2:12:07] pretense of giving their all right
[2:12:11] i tell you when we we're standing at a
[2:12:14] place right now
[2:12:15] where there there can't be pretenders
[2:12:19] we've got to be for real
[2:12:24] we can't just go along and play church
[2:12:27] it's a serious hour that we're in
[2:12:33] think of this words now
[2:12:37] begin spoken out of the mouth of a son
[2:12:41] of god
[2:12:42] that brings upon these sudden
[2:12:45] judgment suddenly
[2:12:50] the same word that brings life
[2:12:53] now brings death to imposters and
[2:12:56] pretenders
[2:12:58] i wonder if that's not where we're
[2:13:00] standing at
[2:13:03] where the very message that a rapture
[2:13:05] church
[2:13:07] will bring death to impostors
[2:13:10] and pretenders
[2:13:17] as i said god laid the bodies of
[2:13:19] anonymized sapphire in the path of every
[2:13:21] hypocrite
[2:13:22] as a reminder don't get in this church
[2:13:25] this will happen to every hypocrite
[2:13:31] now we're not you know in that as i want
[2:13:34] to go back over it again
[2:13:36] aiken as it go into the new land death
[2:13:39] comes on a pretender we come into this
[2:13:42] new land
[2:13:42] death comes upon the pretender
[2:13:47] both of them are now greed pretending
[2:13:50] hiding putting things away
[2:13:55] but this time like that time
[2:13:58] god's not letting them get by with it
[2:14:02] and we're living in a time of great
[2:14:03] judgment where god is not going to let
[2:14:06] people just get on by with pretending
[2:14:09] and play in church
[2:14:12] and just being actors you're going to be
[2:14:16] a sincere
[2:14:17] a man or you're not going to have the
[2:14:19] power to bind the serpent
[2:14:23] this is a time where it separates the
[2:14:25] men from the boys
[2:14:26] as it were for the same word that brings
[2:14:30] life brings depth imposters again
[2:14:33] this is not a return to the harshness of
[2:14:35] the old testament but
[2:14:37] rather when the church stands in its
[2:14:39] position a stern
[2:14:40] warning of the swift judgment
[2:14:44] follow sin
[2:14:47] amen you know again same thing happened
[2:14:51] there in with cyprus and the elements
[2:14:54] let me let me just stop there for a
[2:14:56] moment words
[2:14:57] come out of the mouth of a son of god
[2:15:02] word speaking i i want you to get
[2:15:05] something that what happened in the
[2:15:07] upper room
[2:15:08] empower the people like it did adam it
[2:15:11] put to them a clear deed
[2:15:14] and when you get the holy ghost you also
[2:15:16] have a clear deed
[2:15:18] and it puts you in the in the position
[2:15:20] of speaking
[2:15:22] and here he was speaking
[2:15:26] they were speaking the wonderful works
[2:15:28] of god now they're speaking again
[2:15:31] and and and a lame man walks and now he
[2:15:34] speaks again
[2:15:36] and out of his mouth says ananias
[2:15:41] ananias satan has put in your heart
[2:15:48] think of that
[2:15:51] satan has put this in your heart
[2:15:54] here people were being filled with the
[2:15:56] holy ghost and here's a man
[2:15:58] right in their midst that starts getting
[2:16:00] filled with satan
[2:16:03] and now begins here is he as he begins
[2:16:07] to
[2:16:08] to amplify the very spirit now of
[2:16:11] deception
[2:16:12] and he comes into the church now you
[2:16:15] know
[2:16:15] again again the way it was
[2:16:19] the way it was that that you know he
[2:16:22] he saw joseph called barnabas
[2:16:25] he saw him do it and you know it
[2:16:28] he wanted to be in the same status
[2:16:31] looked on with the same look
[2:16:35] so he comes out now it's his to give he
[2:16:38] could have kept back part of it only
[2:16:39] gave part
[2:16:41] amen he could have said peter i sold
[2:16:43] this for twenty thousand dollars and
[2:16:45] i've kept ten thousand
[2:16:46] my wife and i well we just didn't have
[2:16:48] the whatever the wherewithal to give it
[2:16:50] all we we
[2:16:51] want to give you the ten thousand that
[2:16:53] would have been acceptable but he
[2:16:54] lied he pretended
[2:16:59] to give all and laid it at the apostles
[2:17:02] feet
[2:17:04] and when he did when he did
[2:17:08] death struck him out of peter's mouth
[2:17:12] came words and he felt dead
[2:17:16] and here come as they bundled him up and
[2:17:19] took him out to burr
[2:17:20] to bury him here comes his wife in and
[2:17:23] said
[2:17:24] he gives her a chance he gives her a
[2:17:26] chance to repent
[2:17:28] to be truthful to be honest and he said
[2:17:31] did you really sell this for such and
[2:17:33] such
[2:17:33] yeah we did so well the men that came in
[2:17:37] that are walking in that just bared your
[2:17:39] husband will carry you out
[2:17:41] and down she fell
[2:17:45] what was it when the
[2:17:48] church stands in its position
[2:17:52] there's no more play in church anymore
[2:17:57] i want you to get this you know we we as
[2:18:00] a church should not look for members
[2:18:04] we should look for newborn christians to
[2:18:07] be born again
[2:18:08] and empowered by the spirit of god i
[2:18:11] mean not just
[2:18:12] associates that just come along and want
[2:18:15] to float with the crowd it's a time
[2:18:16] where
[2:18:17] pretenders have to drop away
[2:18:22] that if there ever was a time for people
[2:18:23] to be sincere
[2:18:25] and dedicated and consecrated it's now
[2:18:34] one of the last things brother branham
[2:18:36] said
[2:18:38] in the message communion he said you
[2:18:40] know the hour will soon arise when right
[2:18:42] among us will be the holy spirit will
[2:18:44] speak out like it did
[2:18:45] ananias sapphira remember that hour is
[2:18:47] arriving
[2:18:49] now you just remember that that god is
[2:18:50] going to dwell among his people
[2:18:52] that's what he wants to do now
[2:18:56] god is going to dwell among us and with
[2:18:59] this holy god
[2:19:01] he don't want pretension
[2:19:05] listen it was this incident
[2:19:09] with another sapphire that would
[2:19:11] establish the authority of the church
[2:19:14] the keys of the kingdom was dares to use
[2:19:17] it was there to loose or to bind are you
[2:19:20] with me
[2:19:21] amen the holy spirit would reveal to
[2:19:23] peter the secret of sin
[2:19:26] and and and you know these that were you
[2:19:29] know looking like they were given
[2:19:30] everything they were generous but
[2:19:32] they were just given for this to the
[2:19:34] sake of status
[2:19:39] how often does that happen where that
[2:19:42] that people they actually do something
[2:19:46] they try to serve god for the purpose of
[2:19:48] status
[2:19:51] to be accepted
[2:19:55] how many a young girl has been ruined or
[2:19:57] a young boy has been ruined
[2:19:59] because the person that they were
[2:20:02] choosing was a pretender
[2:20:07] and for the status to be married
[2:20:11] to be attached to be accepted
[2:20:15] they pretended
[2:20:20] i'm telling you we're standing on the
[2:20:22] brink of eternity
[2:20:26] we're standing in a place it's a serious
[2:20:28] hour that we're in
[2:20:31] and and and these these people
[2:20:34] anonymized safari they were not
[2:20:35] outsiders and neither were they enemies
[2:20:38] of the church
[2:20:39] but they were a hindrance inside it
[2:20:43] and where we are standing the hindrance
[2:20:47] will leave
[2:20:55] so if you don't want on this holy ghost
[2:20:57] boat
[2:21:01] now you know i i can see question marks
[2:21:04] popping up over everybody's
[2:21:06] who in the world are you talking about i
[2:21:08] am preaching
[2:21:11] i'm not talking i'm not singling out one
[2:21:14] individual
[2:21:14] and this is not this is to you but it's
[2:21:17] not to you
[2:21:21] i'm saying this is a time where we are
[2:21:24] standing is a time of seriousness
[2:21:27] it's a time of dedication is it time of
[2:21:29] consecration
[2:21:30] it's a time when your joy must be the
[2:21:32] lord
[2:21:34] amen where that he becomes a place where
[2:21:37] you rest
[2:21:39] and that pretending is over with but
[2:21:42] that you're real and genuine
[2:21:46] i mean come on when we see things like
[2:21:48] this
[2:21:49] begin to happen and the holy spirit
[2:21:51] begin to move in such a way
[2:21:54] and we're here at the end time god's
[2:21:56] going to dwell among his people
[2:21:58] and where there's a holy god it will
[2:22:01] separate
[2:22:03] the unholiness among us because he
[2:22:07] circumcises the heart listen brother
[2:22:10] branham said in a total deliverance he
[2:22:12] said
[2:22:12] when the church shall come be completely
[2:22:15] delivered when everything comes under
[2:22:17] the blood
[2:22:17] when your sins come under the blood when
[2:22:20] you're smoking you're gambling you're
[2:22:21] cheating you're stealing
[2:22:23] when you're lying when everything is
[2:22:25] brought in the blood
[2:22:26] then there'll be a total deliverance if
[2:22:28] you're wrong somebody
[2:22:30] make it right you can't bring that under
[2:22:31] the blood it won't stay you can't bring
[2:22:33] it
[2:22:34] somebody something won't let you do it
[2:22:36] when when your
[2:22:37] yourself is completely totally brought
[2:22:40] under the blood
[2:22:42] there will be a total deliverance then
[2:22:44] you'll have a
[2:22:45] freedom like you've never known before
[2:22:48] when everything's brought out of the
[2:22:50] blood and brought in submission
[2:22:52] to the kingdom of god then there'll be a
[2:22:54] real deliverance
[2:22:57] and look what happened in acts 5 11.
[2:23:00] look what happened after anonymous
[2:23:03] sapphire you think
[2:23:04] it stopped it you think it it caused a a
[2:23:07] quail in the hearts
[2:23:09] but there was a great fear or reverence
[2:23:14] the the entire church was seized with a
[2:23:18] powerful fear of god which came
[2:23:21] all over everybody that heard what
[2:23:23] happened
[2:23:25] and what happened then the apostles
[2:23:28] performed
[2:23:29] many signs and wonders among the people
[2:23:34] and they were all with one accord
[2:23:39] look what the results of this was amen
[2:23:42] it purged the church
[2:23:44] and when it purged the church amen there
[2:23:46] was even more
[2:23:48] miracles and signs and wonders
[2:23:51] done
[2:23:56] and the believers were you wonderfully
[2:23:58] united that's what it means
[2:24:00] they were in one accord they met
[2:24:02] regularly at the temple
[2:24:06] we ought to meet regularly every time
[2:24:09] the church doors
[2:24:10] come open amen jesus had
[2:24:14] a habit it was his custom to go to
[2:24:17] church
[2:24:18] he went into synagogue and as was his
[2:24:22] custom
[2:24:24] amen you said well i don't want it to be
[2:24:26] a custom i don't want it to be a ritual
[2:24:28] it's one ritual you better have
[2:24:31] that we assembled together even so much
[2:24:33] some more
[2:24:34] as we see that day approaching amen but
[2:24:38] coming with an expectancy
[2:24:39] i want to see god i want to see jesus
[2:24:43] it's a time of repressing and i don't
[2:24:45] want to miss it
[2:24:47] amen and and there was
[2:24:51] more and more believed in the lord and
[2:24:54] more added to the number of great crowds
[2:24:56] of men and women
[2:24:57] in fact when the people knew that peter
[2:25:00] was going to walk by
[2:25:02] they would carry the six out to the
[2:25:04] street
[2:25:05] laid them on cots and mats and there was
[2:25:08] an incredible power
[2:25:10] that was emanating from him that would
[2:25:13] overshadow them
[2:25:14] and would heal them amen great
[2:25:17] numbers of people swarmed to jerusalem
[2:25:20] from the nearby
[2:25:21] villages and they brought the sick and
[2:25:24] those were troubled with demons
[2:25:26] and everyone was healed you talk about a
[2:25:29] revival
[2:25:30] when you got sin out of the midst you
[2:25:32] can have revival
[2:25:34] when you get sin out of your heart you
[2:25:35] can have a repression
[2:25:37] amen would you want to see the power of
[2:25:39] god move then
[2:25:40] let everybody begin to call on the name
[2:25:43] of the lord
[2:25:43] because those that call on the name of
[2:25:45] the lord they shall be saved
[2:25:49] amen i'm going to finish
[2:25:53] on this quotation y'all hadn't changed
[2:25:55] that clock and you thought you fooled me
[2:25:59] but i just got another hour right there
[2:26:04] brother branham preached he tells about
[2:26:08] the story of mary and joseph taking
[2:26:10] jesus to jerusalem
[2:26:12] to the feast of the passover and there
[2:26:15] they left jesus thinking he was with
[2:26:16] them
[2:26:18] brother branham used this story over and
[2:26:20] over again and he said we went more than
[2:26:22] a three-day journey
[2:26:24] we went 2 000 years without him
[2:26:27] but we got to go back and return to the
[2:26:29] place we left him
[2:26:31] and he pointed out the place that the
[2:26:33] church left him was pentecost
[2:26:37] and he said we find it in our churches
[2:26:38] this is 1965.
[2:26:40] we find out in our churches we're
[2:26:42] missing something in our churches
[2:26:44] and that's the power of christ
[2:26:48] now he said i don't want to criticize i
[2:26:50] love you a genuine
[2:26:51] with a genuine love and love is always
[2:26:53] corrected we are
[2:26:55] missing christ in our church we're
[2:26:56] missing christ amongst our pentecostal
[2:26:59] people
[2:27:00] our brothers and sisters there's
[2:27:02] something wrong
[2:27:04] the old-fashioned prayer meetings they
[2:27:06] used to have
[2:27:07] all day and night they don't have them
[2:27:09] no more our women used to wear
[2:27:11] long hair they don't do it anymore it
[2:27:14] would be a disgrace for women
[2:27:16] to paint and use paint back in the early
[2:27:18] days and act the way that women do
[2:27:20] something went wrong there's nothing
[2:27:22] wrong with christ
[2:27:23] but something went wrong somewhere the
[2:27:26] pulpit used to
[2:27:27] see we wouldn't have permitted such a
[2:27:30] thing as that but it does
[2:27:31] now no longer are words
[2:27:34] coming out of the mouse
[2:27:38] we're missing something we're missing
[2:27:42] power
[2:27:43] that we ought to have where the big
[2:27:46] machine
[2:27:46] ought to be running up at great signs
[2:27:49] and wonders
[2:27:50] why this building ought to be so sitting
[2:27:53] so full of the power of god
[2:27:54] now to sinner couldn't stay in there the
[2:27:57] holy spirit
[2:27:58] the condemnant right quickly like that
[2:28:00] like ananias sapphiras
[2:28:02] we're missing something he would say
[2:28:05] again where are we short god
[2:28:07] i want to live today to see the day that
[2:28:10] the church of jesus christ
[2:28:12] can be one and purpose and heart
[2:28:15] and body standing in the full anointed
[2:28:19] power of the holy spirit
[2:28:20] to perform and work like jesus christ
[2:28:23] did
[2:28:24] with god in them too
[2:28:28] it's a church out of position
[2:28:34] and sadly we don't just need to look
[2:28:37] around at pentecostal and baptist and
[2:28:40] methodists
[2:28:41] we need to look right at our own ranks
[2:28:44] and say why if god be with us
[2:28:49] where are the miracles
[2:28:58] he uses that illustration of them
[2:29:01] leaving jesus at jerusalem
[2:29:03] and i'm closing on this
[2:29:06] and he says i believe the church has
[2:29:09] done that
[2:29:10] just upon the thoughts oh he's with us
[2:29:14] oh he's with us we don't have to have
[2:29:17] miracles and signs and so forth
[2:29:20] we don't have to have divine healing
[2:29:21] today we don't have to have the gifts of
[2:29:23] the spirit they're not for this day
[2:29:25] oh he's with us anyhow and he said oh my
[2:29:28] precious brothers
[2:29:30] do you realize we have found out that
[2:29:32] all our creeds and churches were
[2:29:34] finding discord and confusion
[2:29:36] something's wrong
[2:29:37] and sometimes we think he might be among
[2:29:40] our kindred i heard that expression many
[2:29:42] times my mother was a methodist or
[2:29:44] baptist or presbyterian or so
[2:29:46] you'll never find him like that and
[2:29:48] sometimes you depend on what your mother
[2:29:50] had and experience to atone for you
[2:29:52] it's got to be your own personal faith
[2:29:54] in god
[2:29:56] you just don't find him there so they
[2:29:58] checked from pastor to pastor
[2:30:00] from church to church we would say
[2:30:03] making it modern
[2:30:04] and they could not find him anywhere and
[2:30:06] he said i feel sorry for people today
[2:30:08] many thousands of people in this nation
[2:30:11] that's belong to dozens of different
[2:30:13] churches trying to find where jesus is
[2:30:16] and they just go from one certain church
[2:30:18] and check there they go to another
[2:30:19] church and check there and they
[2:30:20] find out there's something wrong they
[2:30:22] don't act like believe like worship
[2:30:24] light
[2:30:24] there's no sound of the king in the camp
[2:30:28] there's no joy
[2:30:31] now remember we were there what will the
[2:30:34] holy ghost do
[2:30:36] it brings times of refreshing
[2:30:40] when the holy spirit is in a church it
[2:30:43] brings
[2:30:43] times of refreshing and he said i might
[2:30:47] say that if there was
[2:30:48] one thing i find among the pentecostal
[2:30:52] people that makes me to believe
[2:30:54] that they are certainly outstanding
[2:30:56] christians is not because
[2:30:58] they're speaking with tongues or signs
[2:31:01] of the divine healing
[2:31:02] it's the joy that they have
[2:31:07] well let's just start with that
[2:31:11] let's just start getting our joy back
[2:31:14] let's just start getting refreshed in
[2:31:16] the presence of god
[2:31:17] let's just begin to where he is my
[2:31:20] everything he is my all
[2:31:21] right remember when my focus is on his
[2:31:24] coming
[2:31:25] he said it's the he said they have
[2:31:30] no embarrassment
[2:31:33] hello they just let their hair down and
[2:31:36] start rejoicing
[2:31:37] because they got something they're not
[2:31:39] ashamed of and that makes me believe
[2:31:41] there's something outstanding about them
[2:31:43] they're not ashamed they just soon as
[2:31:47] shout
[2:31:47] out there in the street as they would
[2:31:49] here in the church
[2:31:51] and if a hundred people are laughing at
[2:31:53] them that wouldn't stop them a bit they
[2:31:55] continue on
[2:31:56] shouting joy and find them on the
[2:31:59] mission field starved to death
[2:32:00] almost have seen them where they have no
[2:32:02] shoes on their feet living off of 30
[2:32:04] cents a week preaching the gospel
[2:32:05] brother
[2:32:06] just as happy as if he was coming to
[2:32:08] church in the limousine
[2:32:09] they're happy for they've found
[2:32:11] something that means more than creeds or
[2:32:13] denomination or church affiliation
[2:32:15] they found what it takes to bring joy
[2:32:17] and a christian
[2:32:18] should be happy we were prayed for
[2:32:22] that that our joys might be full
[2:32:25] it's something about it that's real now
[2:32:28] we've lost that joy and if we lost those
[2:32:30] things
[2:32:31] and we can't find it among our kindred
[2:32:33] we can find it among them then that's
[2:32:35] one
[2:32:36] one thing to do is go back where we left
[2:32:39] him out
[2:32:41] and the church should go back to the
[2:32:43] beginning where they
[2:32:44] left him and that's exactly what mary
[2:32:47] and joseph did they left jesus at the
[2:32:49] feast
[2:32:49] that's where mary and joseph left jesus
[2:32:51] and he said i say this with
[2:32:53] due consideration and respect that's
[2:32:55] where both catholic and protestants left
[2:32:57] jesus
[2:32:58] at the feast of pentecost you can't find
[2:33:01] him
[2:33:01] searching around through creeds and
[2:33:03] denominations denomination and creeds
[2:33:05] and all should go back to the beginning
[2:33:08] when jesus on the earth he said i'm
[2:33:10] divine you're the branches
[2:33:11] and if a vine comes forth and a branch
[2:33:13] comes out of that vine
[2:33:15] the first branch comes up the second
[2:33:17] branch looks just like the first one
[2:33:19] the third one looks just like the first
[2:33:20] one and on to the end of the vine
[2:33:23] and every branch looks the same one
[2:33:25] don't come up with grapevine leaves and
[2:33:27] the other with pawpaw leaves
[2:33:28] and another with oak leaves and another
[2:33:31] with palm leaves
[2:33:32] it starts a grape belief it ends with a
[2:33:34] great leaf
[2:33:35] and if the first church was a product of
[2:33:37] that vine jesus christ
[2:33:39] and wrote a book of acts out of it the
[2:33:42] second branch will have to be the same
[2:33:44] or it's been grafted into something that
[2:33:46] has a different life
[2:33:48] i am the vine you are the branches of
[2:33:49] the first branch brought forth
[2:33:51] joy love loyalty gifts of the spirit
[2:33:55] casting out evil spirits water baptism
[2:33:58] by
[2:33:58] my mercy then we today find today that
[2:34:02] all of that is not in the church then
[2:34:04] the church is getting
[2:34:05] the church is not getting its life from
[2:34:07] the vine we
[2:34:08] baptist methodist pentecostals and what
[2:34:11] more
[2:34:12] amen if our church cannot write a book
[2:34:14] of acts listen to me message believers
[2:34:16] if our church cannot write a book of
[2:34:18] acts behind this church
[2:34:20] then it's the wrong vine there's
[2:34:23] something wrong with it
[2:34:24] if jesus was on earth today i'd walk
[2:34:27] unto him and say
[2:34:28] lord jesus i go to church that don't
[2:34:30] believe in divine healing
[2:34:31] he would say it wasn't so from the
[2:34:34] beginning
[2:34:35] if i went to jesus said lord my church
[2:34:37] does not believe in speaking with other
[2:34:39] tongues
[2:34:39] he would say it's not so from the
[2:34:41] beginning if i went to the lord jesus
[2:34:44] said i've been sprinkled my church says
[2:34:45] it's all right my pastor said i'll
[2:34:47] sprinkle you in water
[2:34:48] it's just as good as immersion in water
[2:34:51] jesus was answered
[2:34:52] it wasn't so at the beginning if i
[2:34:54] walked to jesus and shook
[2:34:56] hands and took the right hand of
[2:34:58] fellowship from a church
[2:34:59] and i believe that then i was born again
[2:35:02] jesus would say
[2:35:03] it is not so from the beginning we've
[2:35:06] got to go
[2:35:07] back to the beginning where did the
[2:35:10] church lead jesus
[2:35:11] at pentecost and that's where the
[2:35:13] churches will have to go to find it
[2:35:15] is back to pentecost that's what we were
[2:35:18] preaching today friend we've been more
[2:35:20] than a three-day journey we've been
[2:35:22] through seven church ages
[2:35:24] and it's time for the church to turn all
[2:35:26] the way back
[2:35:27] to a book of acts experience to where an
[2:35:29] anonymized sapphire is among us
[2:35:31] we're pretending it's over and where
[2:35:33] there's refreshing from the presence of
[2:35:35] the lord
[2:35:36] and joy unspeakable and full of glory
[2:35:39] that ought to be the ambition of the
[2:35:41] church that has held the coming of the
[2:35:43] lord jesus
[2:35:44] and we saw it and say come lord jesus
[2:35:47] come
[2:35:48] and it'd be the drive of our heart our
[2:35:50] ambition
[2:35:51] what accord one we've got to have
[2:35:54] jesus our parish
[2:35:58] amen happy to believe that this morning
[2:36:00] stand to your feet with me and worship
[2:36:02] god
[2:36:03] as the musicians come amen oh my where
[2:36:06] did we find that spirit
[2:36:08] power where do we find those people that
[2:36:10] are drunk like they were on the day of
[2:36:12] pentecost so drunk
[2:36:14] on the spirit of god they started
[2:36:15] staggered like drunk men
[2:36:17] oh let me tell you he said my catholic
[2:36:19] friend the blessed
[2:36:21] mary virgin mary was in there that's
[2:36:23] right and if god wouldn't let virgin
[2:36:25] mary come to heaven
[2:36:27] until she was filled with the holy ghost
[2:36:28] dare you try to get there with anything
[2:36:34] less
[2:36:36] hallelujah how many would say today god
[2:36:39] let us enter into that time we're
[2:36:40] pretending it's over
[2:36:43] well the hypocrisy is out of my heart
[2:36:46] where i'm not pretending anymore but i'm
[2:36:48] for real
[2:36:50] amen where i have that joy unspeakable
[2:36:53] and full of glory
[2:36:55] the times of refreshing that you want
[2:36:58] that
[2:36:58] refreshing from the presence of the lord
[2:37:05] buy your head's with me
[2:37:10] oh jesus where are we standing
[2:37:16] where are we standing we're living in a
[2:37:18] dangerous hour
[2:37:21] and the only place we're going to find
[2:37:22] you is where
[2:37:25] the church left you many years ago
[2:37:29] they left you at pentecost
[2:37:32] i went through some scripture this
[2:37:34] morning just to show
[2:37:35] the church just what the early church
[2:37:38] was and how you were moving among them
[2:37:42] i went through all of that to show again
[2:37:44] we're standing
[2:37:46] at the very same place
[2:37:50] and jesus is coming by our fig tree
[2:37:52] looking for fruit
[2:37:56] lord i don't know that there's time to
[2:38:00] dung it
[2:38:02] and let it fulfill another season that
[2:38:04] church ages are over we're at the last
[2:38:06] one
[2:38:08] i don't know if it's time how could be
[2:38:11] another messenger come and dunk it and
[2:38:14] expect to find fruit again we're in the
[2:38:18] last day
[2:38:19] if there's no fruit on the tree it'll be
[2:38:22] cursed forever
[2:38:30] we're living in the time lord where
[2:38:32] scoffers arise saying where is the sign
[2:38:34] of his coming
[2:38:38] there's a people that are hungry
[2:38:42] they're in one accord
[2:38:46] they're different from this world they
[2:38:49] got their mindset on one thing
[2:38:53] i want to get out of here
[2:38:59] i want to leave this world of sin and
[2:39:02] unbelief
[2:39:04] it's crashing around us
[2:39:08] the american flag that used to be
[2:39:11] loved and honored and appreciated spit
[2:39:13] on burned
[2:39:16] it used to be an emblem of freedom
[2:39:20] and now they've taken freedom to where
[2:39:23] they can do
[2:39:23] and live any kind of thing
[2:39:25] [Music]
[2:39:27] it started out with freedom we can have
[2:39:30] freedom of religion
[2:39:32] [Music]
[2:39:33] and the evil ones have turned to word
[2:39:35] they want freedom from religion
[2:39:42] and our nation is quickly
[2:39:46] turning no longer is it speaking like a
[2:39:50] lamb
[2:39:52] it's speaking like a dragon
[2:39:55] [Music]
[2:39:57] it's speaking too
[2:40:07] but may there be a people here today
[2:40:09] that know they're empowered
[2:40:10] [Music]
[2:40:12] that know where they're standing
[2:40:16] that there is a word there is a message
[2:40:18] there is a truth
[2:40:20] that will change lives that heal the
[2:40:23] sick
[2:40:25] lord we want to thank you for the many
[2:40:27] healings that we've seen
[2:40:28] miracles
[2:40:32] lord i just marvel at your works lord
[2:40:36] i'd even marvel lord what you've done in
[2:40:38] my own family my little wife
[2:40:40] blow after blow after blow
[2:40:42] [Music]
[2:40:44] the devil has come and grace after grace
[2:40:48] after grace has been given
[2:40:53] lord i think about these who went on
[2:40:55] before us
[2:40:58] some of these that we talked about today
[2:40:59] that have already
[2:41:01] crossed into eternity
[2:41:06] left footprints
[2:41:10] they ran their race whatever we would
[2:41:14] say about them wouldn't change their
[2:41:15] race
[2:41:17] or how they ran it it's to every it's
[2:41:21] every man's whether his
[2:41:24] servant stumbles or falls and you're the
[2:41:27] one lord
[2:41:29] you look
[2:41:30] [Music]
[2:41:34] you know whether we stumble or we fall
[2:41:38] or whatever we do lord we want to
[2:41:40] persevere
[2:41:42] we want to please you
[2:41:47] the bible said blessed be the man or
[2:41:50] that servant
[2:41:52] that the lord findeth so doing
[2:41:59] lord if there's pretense in our lives if
[2:42:01] we're just pretending
[2:42:04] we're just going a long life if we if we
[2:42:07] if we if we lost the vision
[2:42:12] of where we were to surrender everything
[2:42:14] to you
[2:42:15] [Music]
[2:42:20] and now we've kept back and yet we're
[2:42:22] pretending
[2:42:24] oh yeah we've done everything the lord
[2:42:26] required we've done everything
[2:42:29] lord i pray that there won't be one
[2:42:32] pretender among us
[2:42:33] not because he dropped dead but because
[2:42:36] sin is judged
[2:42:38] and that sin is dead and they become
[2:42:41] alive in christ
[2:42:43] everybody don't have to turn out like an
[2:42:45] anonymized sapphira
[2:42:48] there was a liar a thief many a one a
[2:42:51] denier like peter
