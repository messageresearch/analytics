Overcomers through you that you've you've endowed us with power from on high that we could overcome in this age Lord you promised there'd be Overcomers and we are the Overcomers of this age we say it with confidence because we've heard our names called father tonight as we go down through through your word and just study it for a little bit Lord I just pray that you'd bring it with Clarity Lord that you would just help me to step aside and and Lord just go at whatever pace and flow that you would have me to go Lord that the word could take effect tonight Lord I just pray now that you take complete control bless the reading of your word Lord and just move me aside now I pray father in Jesus name amen and amen amen ain't God good to us amen if you have your Bibles tonight and you'd like to turn to the scriptures with me we're going to look in Hebrews the 9th chapter we'll read from verse 6 down through verse 14 Hebrews 9 and6 down through verse 14 I'd like to speak to you tonight on this thought that I've been looking at on the atmosphere of Fellowship restored the atmosphere of Fellowship restored amen verse six says now when these things were thus ordained the priest went always into the first Tabernacle accomplishing the service of God but into the second went the high priest alone once a year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the heers of the people the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure for the time then present and which which we offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience which stood only in meats and drinks and diverse Washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation but Christ being come as a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of bulls of of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a hepher sprinkling the unclean sanctify to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God Amen I pra that the Lord will add his Blessing as you take your seat tonight amen how wonderful it is that our thoughts even can be purged and our conscience can be purged in order to serve a living God Amen anden the last time we spoke we spoke here on on on on atmospheres and the battle for atmospheres and I want to kind of pick up where I left off there tonight and and carry it on a little further down and and we talked about how in the beginning that the Earth had been in complete and total chaos and and it was without form and it was void and and brother Bram said what a horrible shape it must have been in nothing but we into the darkness Yonder without light or anything and the churning of the water and that wondering star twisted around and around the orbits out there somewhere it must have been a Terri a terrific mass of something lost a terrific mass of something lost and and the scripture then goes on to tell us there in in Genesis the very first chapter that the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and we find out right there in the very first chapter of the Bible that when God moves things don't stay the same when God begins to move on a heart that heart doesn't stay the same when he begins to move in a home that home doesn't stay the same when he begins to move in a church that church cannot stay the same and and tonight if he begins to move I promise you things won't stay the same when God moves things change and when God moves things change for the better amen and the Earth was in complete disorder and confusion but as the spirit of God began to move upon it out of that chaos came perfect order God can take any situation you're facing tonight no matter how chaotic it may seem and he can bring perfect order to that situation amen and and out of that in that perfect order out of that chaos comes an Eden and in that place of Eden Adam and Eve operated from a place of dominion they operated in a place of dominion with the power of the spoken word and in that atmosphere of Eden before the fall they were on speaking terms with God this isn't very important because we're talking about the restoring you the atmosphere of Fellowship in that atmosphere they had fellowship with God they could speak with God they were on speaking terms and and and Adam could speak and it was as though God himself spoke if Adam said move it moved if Adam said calm down it calmed down if he didn't like this tree in a certain place he said move and that tree moved he was the god of the earth they had fellowship with God and we know that because of the fall and because of the deception and Eve becoming begal that Fellowship was lost Fellowship became lost and without Fellowship mankind began to slip into chaos man this Earth began to slip into chaos like the Earth had been in before the spirit of God moved upon the face of it and we began to slip in into this chaos because we didn't have that daily contact with God we didn't have that fellowship with God anymore the the fellowship in the cool of the evenings as he would come down and walk with Adam and Eve and talk to them and and we know the atmospheres became clogged up with demons to where to where our blessings were cut off Communications were cut off and man becomes a werer and man has to care for himself and all the Outlets of Man became clogged up brother brand talked about how those Outlets that God had created he had made them there so that he could manifest himself through man and all of those Outlets become clogged up and the channels that he made man for and the atmosphere was all wrong everything was out of whack listen it wasn't meant for the lion to go around killing it wasn't meant for that that atmosphere was wrong it was meant for the lion to lay down with the lamb and when the atmospheres get wrong then God can't operate the way that he intends to operate what we have to remember tonight evening light Tabernacle is atmospheres produce now what do they produce well it depends on what the atmosphere is brother bram's very clear all through the message that it's the atmosphere that does it he says if you want to have a a healing meeting you got to get people in the atmosphere of healing he says if you want people filled with the spirit you got to get the place in the atmosphere of being filled with the spirit the atmospheres create that are created is what produces and so atmospheres produce so we need to make it a point as a people to make sure we get the atmosphere right well what is the right atmosphere tonight brother it's an atmosphere that welcomes him into our presence that welcomes his presence into our midst and then we allow him to move move how he wants to move but we want to welcome him we want the atmosphere right in our home we want the atmosphere right in our churches amen we have to create an atmosphere where he feels welcome to visit in our homes where he feels free to operate in our services every one of us have needs tonight every one of us stand here with situations and desires that that we need God to move in but in order for him to move for us we need to make him feel welcome so he can at least come on the scene tonight so he can come into this place and and then go to work on our behalf in our homes as Christians it ought to be a place where God feels welcome you want God to be in your home and you get the atmosphere right pray with the family read the Bible with the family stop all the fussing and fighting in a Christian home it shouldn't be a Home full of fussing and fighting and if there is fussing and fighting shame on you if the kids see it I don't know that just came out but that's how I feel if your kid see fusting and fighting shame on you well sometimes we're going to disagree y'all don't got a one-bedroom house go fuss and fight somewhere else I agree fussing and fighting shouldn't be in the church if there's fussing and fighting in the church the church will never attain to the high in the places that God wants it to attain to we are supposed to dwell together in unity dwell together in harmony it's very important well why is this happening and why let there's too much fussing and fighting amongst the children of God look I understand I know how it is Siblings tend to fight sometimes but that's no excuse for Spiritual siblings to fight sometimes we're trying to get out of here we're trying to lead we've got one goal we're on the same team quit getting divided over little nothings little nothings that don't matter but let's come together in unity and create an atmosphere where God is welcome where lives can be changed where God can move and heal and deliver and fill with the spirit and lay aside listen Unity doesn't mean we all agree it means we're willing to lay aside things for the cause of Christ let's lay things aside and get together to where it's not a place of fussing and fighting because our church are supposed to be fruitful and that will hinder a fruitful church but at the time the atmosphere was all twisted up and and our access to God was cut off but our God is a determined God our God was determined that he would once again have fellowship with man he was determined that the fall wasn't the end of it that sin nature wouldn't always rule over his creation and I want to tell you tonight he determined for you he's determined you're going to make it he's determined you're going to be there he's determined you're going to overcome he sees the trial you're in tonight and he says I'm determined you're coming through I'm determined you're going to make it just look to the word look to the word tonight and hold on I'm determined you're going to make it our God is a determined God and he comes down and he takes on flesh and he begins to operate the way that Adam was was able to operate in the beginning he begins to operate in in that flesh by taking Dominion by speaking the word by controlling nature and in that body of Flesh he conquer sin listen I I know we point to Calvary and you must point to Calvary but he didn't just conquer at Calvary he conquered sin every single day that's what made his death worthy to pay the price he was sinless he conquered sin day after day after day after day he met Satan and he overcame he met Temptation and he overcame Hebrews said he was tempted in like manner as you tempted in everything that you go through faith with depression and anxieties and he overcame it says in John 16 be of good cheer I have overcome the world well why is this so important so when you're born again and you're filled with that life that life has already overcome that sin that so easily beset you that life has already overcome lust that life has already overcome depression that life has already overcome anxiety that life has already overcome whatever it is you're facing tonight it's already been attacked with heartache it's already been attacked with depression and that life came through sinless that life came through Victorious and now that life lives on the inside of you tonight be of good cheer be of good cheer but brother Aaron this is the worst thing I've ever been through he's already conquered it this is the toughest temptation of my life that life inside of you's already conquered it Hallelujah he's already faced it and he's already defeated it listen he says the life that I'm sending back to endue you with power is Battle tested the life that I'm sending you has already been proven it won't fail you in the middle of the battle it won't come up short in the middle of your Temptation it is tried it is true it will overcome it'll take you all the way to a Rapture it's a battle tested life and it's the only life that overcomes the world Amen your best efforts won't do it your religion won't do it your rules and regulations won't do it you have got to be born again so that the life of the Overcomer let me say that again the Overcomer there's only ever been one but when the life of the Overcomer takes control of your life then you become un Overcomer so get the Overcomer on the inside of you tonight and become an overcomer in the last day how am I going to do it the life of the Overcomer lives on the inside of me that was the whole point of the kinsman redeemer that was the whole point of God in flesh it was the whole point of Calvary so that the life of the sacrifice could come back on the worshipper to change his nature so he didn't leave their bound Hallelujah but they would come in and come underneath that shed blood and come out not only covered by it but Changed by it that's where we have to live so that we can say like Paul did in Galatians I'm crucify with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me Christ lives in you don't let that just become something we say don't let that be an emotion don't let that be a one-time altar experience Christ lives in you when daily every moment in the battle in the trial through the fire through the sickness Christ lives in me I live by Christ Alone amen listen some of you here know you've been born again you know you've been born again and you know that you've been changed and yet you find yourself crippled with fear you find yourself crippled with torment you find yourself crippled and bound with depression and you're trying your best to fight it you're trying to overcome those complexes you're trying you're trying to break those family Cycles you see the robber you know what it is you I I know I shouldn't I know it's a cycle I know it's a complex I know you see it and you recognize it and you know what's robbing you and the whole time think about it like this the whole time that life the life of the Overcomer is sitting right there on the inside of you saying just let me at him just let me at him just turn me loose I've already whooped this fell before I've overcome this before I've calm this storm before just let me deal with it just turn me loose tonight some of you's got a rock in the sling and you're standing there doing this at Goliath turn it loose tonight let it go and let it hit its Mark it's Christ on the inside of you turn him loose there's a line roaring let me have him let me have him but we got him caged up turn him loose tonight let him fight your battle he's already overcome it Hallelujah get out of his way tonight and let the life that has already overcome the world live itself out through you Jesus came and began to operate in the flesh the way that Adam had in the garden with dominion and with authority and he opens the way again to Fellowship by stripping Satan of every claim and every right he ever had on man and he paid the debt that only God in flesh could pay and once again a way was made through the atmospheres between God and man as brother brandham says the Bible said he ascended on high and give gifts unto men there was an atmosphere hung over the Earth of Darkness of Gloom of death and we the prayers couldn't come up because the atonement wasn't made but he broke through that Veil he opened up the way Hallelujah so when the world was in chaos with no hope he changed the atmosphere and created an Eden and then when man was lost without hope separated from God he came in flesh he changed the atmosphere and he paid sin's debt on Calvary and then he didn't stop right there too many people today preach Calvary and we should but it didn't stop right there he he went from Calvary down to Hell and he conquered hell yes he did then he comes up to the grave and he rises again and he conquers the grave and then he ascended and as he did he tore through those atmospheres that was clogged by demons and he made a way once again for access to God and now that he ascended and now that the price was paid now he could send back his life that was the whole point of it was sending back his life that it could live in the worshipper so he could send back the Holy Ghost set that so that other men could operate the way he operated so that other men could have dominion so that other men could overcome so that other men could cast out Devils so that other men could preach the the day of salvation that's what he sent it back for so that other men could do exactly what he had done while he was here on the earth in flesh it it wasn't about just being forgiven don't stop tonight at just forgiving I praise God that we're forgiven I thank God that we're Justified but don't stop there move on to sanctification and then don't stop there I Rejoice with you in your sanctification I'm not beating you down or de christianizing you I'm saying there's more for you tonight there's a token for you tonight there's an overcoming life here for you tonight press on to that tonight but now because he sends his life back now you can be empowered now man again could operate the way that God intended them to operate from the position that he intended them to operate from in the beginning even though Satan's still there saying you don't have a right to now you do have a right and you have to fight for it and you have to battle for it and he accuses you constantly but you have a right to be there you have a right to claim your promises you have a right right to cast Satan down you have a right to stand on the word you have a right to claim your children you have a right to claim your healing you're going to fight for it but you have a right to be there he was putting back he was putting man back in a place that they could now fellowship with God again placed back on speaking terms it was about changing Natures because I love this see in the same way that a Kinsman had to be kin in order to pay the debt we had to become his nature in order to have fellowship and be United with him see it wasn't just his nature that was changed he became man so that he could pay our debt so that our nature could be changed so that we could be United with him our Nature has to be changed so that there can be a uniting so there can be a marriage Hallelujah it was about a bride all the time it was about you all the time oh I'm a nobody nope it was all about you I don't know if I'm going to make it you're the one it's all for it's your ceremony it's your wedding supper he did it so your nature could be change that you could be United with him and for a while that first church lived and overcame from that place they not only preached the new birth they achieved the new birth they fellowshipped with God he led them he provided for them they were perfectly in harmony with god brother Bram says the world was almost christianized in one decade with one round of disciples and I read that and I thought about I thought about when God put Adam in the garden he said subdue it these were men going out to subdue they were operating under the same commission that Adam was we're going to go out and take this Earth back this Earth we're going to get men and women we're going to get them to conquer this Earth they're going to subdue it and they're going to get filled with the spirit and they were on a mission they had been commissioned and they were going out subduing just like Adam and and they operated in the faith well brother Aon you didn't say they operated in faith no they operated in the faith what is the faith it's the faith of God it was pure faith it was unadulterated Faith that's right Faith just like God had used when he created the world Faith yeah God had faith God used faith brother Brown says by the same sense God spoke when there was nothing what is that sense that super sense is God the faith of God in you the part of God that comes into you gives you the super sense by that same super sense God framed the world together with things which was not and did not appear he spoke his word and believed his word and a world shook into existence Glory that's that's incredible to me why you think that brother Brandon would say that if there wasn't a law against it you could create a world and go live on it because what faith are we operating by the faith the same Faith that's already spoke a world into existence once it's already happened once this is the faith they were operating by pure Faith amen it it was the same faith that that that Adam had before the fall Adam spoke and it happened how did that happen because he believed he he had no reason not to believe fear hadn't entered in doubt hadn't entered in he just spoke and expected it to be so which is how we're taught that we are to operate just speak and believe it speak the word and go forward well that's what Adam did he was operating by the same faith that had created the garden now he dressed the garden he calmed the winds he moved trees he controlled all nature he controlled all animals because there was no doubt there was God's word and nothing else that's right what a place to be in tonight can we get ourselves to that place to where there's God's word and nothing else there's God's word that says I'm Healed there's God's word that said my offspring are going to be there there's God's word that says he was going to have a church without spot or wrinkle it was God's word that said to the Overcomers of the age will I grant to sit with me on my right hand it's God's word it's God's word and nothing else well I don't know I do just look to God's word tonight amen amen there was God's word and nothing else because you can't fellowship with God and doubt him you cannot fellowship with God and doubt him you can't have Fellowship without faith you can't please God without faith think about it it's impossible to please God without faith then he says when I return will I find faith and then he sends a message to turn our hearts back to the faith it's very important it it almost it almost tickles me but it almost frustrates me when people are like well that guy simple he preaches faith I'm like it gets no deeper than faith it gets no deeper than Faith just going to leave that there because somewhere it got twisted up in people's mind that that faith is simple preaching listen if that's what it takes to please God it don't get no deeper than that cuz that's all I want to do is please God I want the faith of God living in me overcoming in me I don't want to doubt God lord I believe help thou my unbelief I want faith I'm not going to go in a Rapture without faith I got to have perfect Faith this message came to restore the faith oh but these Mysteries and this and this and it's so deep and it is but why did the message come why were the Mysteries revealed why was the message Vindicated faith all your depth and your Mysteries and your spiritual riddles lead back to Faith that's the depth of it it's all about returning to the faith and this first church was operating in the faith of God because because they had been born again they were operating in faith because they had been born again they had receed received the new birth and now they were speaking like Adam spoke before the fall nature was subject demons were subject the body was subject the word was coming forth in power there were fruits now we're going to stop there for a second because if you got the new birth like they got the new birth there will be a harvest of fruits and it won't be a onetime harvest because it ain't a one-time thing the Holy Spirit ain't coming and going it's indwelling and so it should be producing fruits of the spirit there will be a harvest there was fruits if we get what they got will produce the same things are you talking about the Miracles and all that absolutely I am but I'm talking about the overcoming life that's right I'm talking about Victory to live above sin that's right and then all the other things that go with it the Miracles and the signs and the Wonders yes that'll be there too it's it's part of it they were no longer coming and going in and out of the presence of God now based off the sacrifice of a bull or a goat they didn't come in and then leave out from underneath that but now that they had stepped into the shikina glory amen and and that's where you have to go tonight that's where when you step in there the world is shut off from you when you step in there that that's where you find peace when you step in there that's where you find Victory when you enter into the holy of holies and you aren't just out there eating Mana in the outer courts come on somebody you can't just stay out there eating mana and that sure it's real Mana sure it's real blessings out there in the outer courts those are real things but if you aren't sealed Away by the new birth that Mana will spoil listen I'm going go here for just a second if mana's blessings and we believe in blessings amen and if jumping and shouting and dancing because the spirit fell upon us and those things that accompany that are blessings then we want them but don't just be satisfied by those blessings because you can still have that Mana in the holy of holies the Mana is still there but it's Mana that never spools you won't jump and dance on Sunday be defeated on Monday you won't jump and Shout on Wednesday and then be a sinner on Thursday but you'll go into the Holy Ghost to the holy of holies and the world will be sealed out your life will be sealed you'll be an overcomer then you can dance like you've never danced before you can shout like you've never shouted before you will have Victory real victory in the shakina glory when you're living in the presence of of God born again sealed by the spirit then you're living in a different atmosphere amen I can't just hang mine on this neat little hook because it hangs out on the floor and then I'll end up tripping and walking all over it but you're living in a different atmosphere then Amen in that atmosphere an old Dead stick began to produce almonds think about it it began to Pro produce What It produced at the beginning back when it was connected to the Life Source before it was cut off before it became a a staff before it had been dead for 50 years it went back past all that and began to prod produc What It produced at the beginning amen it began to bring forth life that's what happens to a Believer when they're born again your life may look dead it may look dried up but once it lays in the atmosphere that life begins to Blossom and then from that Blossom comes fruits and then you'll start to produce the very light that you were supposed to produce all along when God formed you when God made you he said here's the life I want and for years it was dead for years it didn't produce but then you get it in the holy of holies and it lays in that atmosphere and it blossoms and it grows and it gives the fruit that you were always meant to produce Hallelujah that life becomes fruitful you are a son and daughter of God and you begin to yield the fruits of the spirit but you can't yield those fruits in the outer Court it can't just be on the Flesh and on the spirit listen I enjoy feeling it on my flesh I enjoy it on my spirit but that ain't what SEALs you that ain't what changes you let it get down on the inside go into the holy of holies and let the holy and holies get on the inside of you and let your life be changed brother Brown says that's the way you see people oh they say we're eating the good Mana of God that's right but where are they living they're living out there eating it in an atmosphere that they should not eat it in but when he once walked in behind that holiest of holies walked into the presence of God and the veil falls behind him there's a lot there's a pot of Mana where he can eat it every day and every hour of the week There's where he's living in the shikina glory where in the interlock wings of the cherubims the great Pillar of Fire and the Shina rested there and he's living under there he can't be nothing but a real genuine Christian anytime and then he just says atmosphere atmosphere you become a real genuine Christian yes there's Mana that falls in the outer courts but we have to go inside behind the inner Veil into the holy of holies because out there you're up and down out there you're in and out you're shook by this and you're shook by that this preacher says this but this preacher says that so now I'm tore up and and I'm Shook and and I'm living in the outer courts and when you're there you're subject to the winds and the storms and this person said this to me and I'm hurt we all get hurt we all get hurt I'm not questioning your hurt right I've never questioned someone's offense we all get offended let's be real for a minute all of us have times where people get on our nerves you can see oh there'll be no lies here tonight we all go through that but we're in the holy of holies so that's just the wind and it don't bother us that's just a little storm outside and it don't bother us cuz I'm in here in the holy of holies and my life is blooming and my life is fruitful and I'm overcoming and the god of Heaven's on the inside of me and that may hurt me but press on and that may bother me but I press on and that may get on my nerves but I press on and I come together and we worship together and we praise together we overcome together we're Victorious together we're going to Rapture together if you get in the holy of holies where those things don't move you anymore go inside and get born again and let the shakina cut off all the ne negative atmospheres cut you off from your own thinking cut you off from your reasoning and and and live in a place to where the attacks don't ruin your atmosphere but your atmosphere repels the attacks listen it shouldn't bring you down every time something comes against you or somebody offends because it's going to happen all the time if that's how we we're going to be upset a lot but the atmosphere you live in should repel those things away from you like water off of a duck's bag amen Christians with the Life of Christ on the inside displaying that life to the World by bearing the fruit of the spirit not just by saying I go to church you you should come check out my church oh I didn't know you went to church well that's a red flag you should be bearing the fruit of the spirit you should be testifying to the world that there's a living God by The Works that I do shall you do also by the atmosphere of a holy God surrounding your life a life overflowing with joy a life overflowing with peace a life overflowing with gentleness you can't live your life in a negative atmosphere and then walk around talking about the token life on the inside those things don't go together no come on guys I'm I'm real I I know we have bad days we're not always going to be that's not how it always is but you shouldn't live in this place you shouldn't live in a an atmosphere of negativity live in an atmosphere of the wowy wowy Woos and woe is me and and I can't believe this happened to me and I've got the worst luck and I've got this and and nobody listen I I'm miserable talking about it that don't I had to fight off depression there for a second like no devil no I can't live like that because in spite of all that I know I'm a Child of God it's a bad day but he died for me it's a bad day but he gave me the Holy Ghost it's a bad day but he sent a message it's a bad day but he healed my body I'm having a bad day but me and my offspring are going to be there what do I have to be S [Applause] about what are you producing does your atmosphere bring peace or is every time you come around there's fussing and fighting and it's always filled with drama listen it's like this if everywhere you go it stinks you need to check your shoe man every time around them people they're just fussing and fight then I go over here and they're fuss I can't find nobody getting along hello yeah there's one common denominator well it's just always drama is it funny I've said this before but there's something people that know about all the drama and there's literally people in this church that don't have the first clue about any drama that's ever gone on here you know why they don't feed on it they don't like it they don't want it and so they don't even know about it because they choose not to be a part of it drama in your life is a choice check your atmosphere check where you're living at because if you're living in that Heavenly atmosphere of the Holy Ghost born of the spirit your life will Bloom and bring forth fruits of the spirit not fruits of division not fruits of Gossip not fruits of doubt and unbelief fruits of negativity because those are fruits of the curse all those fruits come from the curse and they're not from the new birth but the but the first church age was born again and were producing fruits because they were born again Faith was restored Fellowship was restored they were back like Adam and Eve again it was a love affair between them and God God and his church or should I say it was God and his bride that first church was to be the bride brother Brenham says the birth of the church was at Pentecost and as the first Adam was given a bride fresh from the hand of God undefiled for a brief span so was Christ the last Adam given a bride pure and fresh at Pentecost and she remained separate and undefiled for some time he says in the Harvest time now the second Eve watch her she was created a new like he was at the day of Pentecost filled with the spirit fed by the word amen she was to be Christ's bride he says she was born on the day of Pentecost she was Spirit-filled and she was word fed that was to be the bride and for a time just like Eve she remains pure and and for a time once again there's Fellowship through the new birth I want you to understand that without the new birth you are not in fellowship with God through the new birth there was Fellowship those that were being added each and every day weren't joining they were were being born right they were being born into it Natures were being changed Faith was being restored Fellowship restored and Paul knew exactly what was going on he recognized the significance of it all this wasn't just a movement this wasn't just a religion this just was wasn't just a church this was a bride for Christ and looking back he recognizes what had been restored and where they stood and he knew what had happened in Eden and he feared that once again Satan would try to defile the bride and so he says in 2 Corinthians 11: 2 we'll read through verse 4 I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chased virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ for if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another Spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted ye might well bear with him now that last line there what does that mean it means you happily put up with whatever anyone tells you even if they preach a different Jesus than the one we preach he's like I'm worried about you because there's all kind of doctrines and things going along going around in the ranks of the message and and we just put up with it we just sitting back and gum it down he says and I'm worried now think about it why' I make that parallel if he said that he had espoused us to Christ as a virgin and our messenger said I preached what Paul preached what was he doing for us what was his message he was espousing a bride for Christ that he could present her as a virgin listen we're not here to to chop down other churches and chop down other Ministries no sir we're fighting for the same goal but what I am saying is we're not supposed to just gum down every little thing and accept every little Doctrine stay with the message you don't want to be deceived stay with the message you don't want to be beguiled stay with the message stay with what the prophet said don't run off after this and run off after this he said I fear you're going to be deceived he said Eve the Serpent's Whispering again and you're listening again he says Eve don't accept anything but the word or you're going to be begal again and now this second Eve born here at Pentecost found herself with the same Choice stay with the faith stay with the word and remain Pure or listen to the LIE of the enemy the original Faith think about has been restored God God has done marvelous things trust and fellowship have been restored by the New Birth the Jude recognizes what's going on he cries out contend for the faith we've got the faith this is the faith of God contend for it don't lose it don't go that way don't listen to what they're saying but they put up with the false teachings and as Paul said they bore with them false teachers and soon it took hold reasoning and man's thinking took took the place of faith and that's exactly what had happened in the Garden of Eden prophet of God says Adam lost his inheritance the earth now it passed from his hand to the one he sold it to Satan he sold his faith in God to Satan's reasonings therefore his eternal life his right to the Tree of Life his right to the Earth belonged to him and he forfeited every bit to the hands of Satan he passed it from his hand to Satan he says in the breach the title deed to eternal life Abstract title deed to eternal life when Adam forfeited for wisdom instead of faith it went back to the hands of the owner so the first Eve listened and fell and sold their faith she hybridized the faith that's what brother brandham would say she doubted what God Said and so she took some of what God Said and she took some of what the devil said she mixed it all together she said here it is she lost the title they lost fellowship and now the second e Falls once again because Satan comes and begals and this church chooses wisdom and knowledge and the leadership of man and the prophet of God said naturally fail in Eden by listening to Satan's reasoning against God's word that's how she fell all right sir she fail because she did that spiritual leave now that's the church Christ's bride she fell not in Eden but in Rome see at the NAIA Council when she rejected that Pentecostal Church you have another eeve fallen and just like that Eve the church hybridized the faith just like Eve natural had done in the garden and once again trust is broken the faith was mixed with fears and frustrations and failures and theology mixed in with with with paganism and the church mixed it all together just like Eve did and said here it is this is the faith this is it and just as before when the world went into a chaos the church goes into chaos the church goes into idolatry and there's confusion and fear and there's an atmosphere of Doubt around the church listen there was no way that church could could Rapture there was no way there could be a Rapture Satan Twisted it up and it fell further and further out of Fellowship further and further away from the New Birth further and further away from the faith that would be needed how could there be a marriage if there couldn't even be Fellowship you couldn't have a marriage if you couldn't even have Fellowship Church we were in a mess we were in a bad spot Eve was beg galed and she was being drugged further and further away from Eden all the time beg galed and everything was lost beg galed and faithless headed the wrong direction all the time what brother Bram say it was just a big terrific mass of something lost and the spirit of God moved Hallelujah and he said I will restore and the spirit of God moved and and out comes justification and the spirit of God moves and he says I'm going to bring them back in into Fellowship I'm going to turn them back to the original oh my all it takes tonight is for the spirit of God to move and atmospheres began to change the spirit of God moved and the just shall live by faith the spirit of God moved and all of a sudden you had sanctification the spirit of God moved and Along Comes Aza Street and the restoration of the gifts and what did it do it brought order again just like he had in the Garden of Eden and yet there still couldn't be Fellowship why because it was still hybrid those were truths but there were still ideas of mans and dogmas mixed into those truths it was still hybridized there was still claims against the church you know that they had enough light to to know that he was the son of God they had enough light to claim him as their personal savior but false teaching still had the church bound up the faith still hadn't turned back to the original but he wasn't done he wasn't done restoring he said I will restore all he wasn't just going to stop halfway he said I'm not going to stop until this bride tree is restored all the way back up into its complete glory amen he wasn't done because there was still a message coming there was a message coming in this day to restore Fellowship to restore Bible truth to restore the doctrine of the new birth to get us in line that we could have Fellowship again there was supposed to be light at the evening time there was going to be a called out group who once again could fellowship with God through the new birth there was supposed to be a Rapture church he hasn't forgotten don't think for a minute he's forgotten us here in leosia listen the wheels may be grinding slow but they grind sure there will be a Rapture you will be a part of it he said he'd send Elijah and he did it he said he'd turn our hearts and he did it he said there'll be Overcomers and there will be he hasn't forgot us here hallelujah but the atmosphere had to be right for a Rapture because atmosphere is produce and the atmosphere that was on the church couldn't produce a Rapture the bride had to be turned away from doubt the bride had to be turned away from fear and isms and and these little doctrines and and Theology and Catholic doas and the message came to change the atmosphere around the church and it brought us back to a place of believing again what he have to do with Sarah he had to get her attitude right he had to get the atmosphere right he had to get her believing again so she could receive the promised son so she could receive a body change it had to turn us back to Faith again back to a place where a people operated by the word a people lived by the word a people people moveed by the word and it did that and how did it do that it did that by just like the first church it brought us back to the new birth that's how it brought us back to that place again it brought us back to the new birth for without the new birth there can be no fellowship with God we don't we we don't I I know there can be no Fellowship without blood but we don't have the literal blood today we have the life of the blood so there can be no Fellowship unless it's under the life of that blood amen it's the Holy Ghost and when you get in there and it gets in then and it gets on the inside of you then you can have Fellowship this is the age of restored Fellowship this is a message of restored Fellowship this is the message that brings us not part of the way back that doesn't restore a partial truth or a little truth this is the message that ties it all together this is the message that brings us back into an atmosphere of Fellowship amen now we can speak now we can Fellowship now we can talk to God listen I'm thankful for Luther I'm thankful for Wesley I'm thankful for isua but none of them allowed you to again openly fellowship with God because they operated in portions they operated with claims against them listen it's it's I I want to drive this home it's not a knock on other ages it's not looking down on them they operated in the fullness of what they were given they went as far as they could go in the light God gave them they operated in the fullness of the message of their day but the fullness of all of it wasn't given to them we can't look down our noses because more has been given in this age they fulfilled all they could they did their part but Fellowship could not be fully restored because the Holy Ghost was not given in its fullness you must have the new birth to Fellowship I'm going to go through some of these quotes he says on the inside of the holiest of holies one man once a year went in there but when our real sacrifice Jesus Christ died at Calvary he rent the veil in two making the way with his own blood that whosoever will can come into the shika glory in the presence of the Holy Ghost and be filled with the power of Pentecost as they did after the veil had been torn down yellow brown black white male female Gentile Jew whosoever will let him come and drink from the Fountain of the Lord when they come into that shakana Glory Anointed with the Holy Spirit then they got fellowship with God again then their sons and daughters of God no wonder we sto at the water of separation and try to Fellowship from there you can't do it you stop by the side of the blood without entering into the holy place you are not in Fellowship you must go all the way he says justification is Waters of separation and sanctification cleansing of our soul and when we go into the holiest of holies where the Shak kind of Glory is by that one Spirit we are baptized into that one body and have fellowship with God Amen you'll never be able to do it by the Waters of Separation alone so justification doesn't do it he said now he's not in Fellowship yet yet he's separated from his sins but he's not in Fellowship yet look sanctification won't do it he says that brings you Methodist up all right for your sanctification still not in Fellowship still don't do it but when they went he was inside the building but you could fellowship with with one another greet one another but no fellowship with God yet it doesn't Grant full access there couldn't be restored Fellowship until this message there couldn't be restored to the atmosphere like they had in Eden on speaking terms until this message under those things it wouldn't allow a Rapture because in that condition you can't return to open face-to-face Fellowship Amen brother brandham says that is the only place of Fellowship in those ages they couldn't return all the way back why well simple they didn't have the word restored the book was still a sealed book but in this age listen how many people have long to sit where you're sitting in this age where the Books open and they can return to a condition a fellowship with God once again where he hears them and he speaks back and you can operate in that place where all your rights are restored and you have the right to look Satan in the eye and you can speak the word take your hands off my property back off of my property give me my promises give me my Mountain we stand in that place tonight because there's restored Fellowship through the Holy Ghost In other words under this message there is full adoption that's what this message is we're not operating in a place of a portion and therefore we need another step no we don't need another step this birth is the token and this token is the adoption amen amen the Holy Ghost as we know it the new birth like they received at the day of Pentecost wasn't available in previous stages of restoration not as we know it not exactly like they had it at Pentecost it hasn't returned like that until now and in the previous stages of restoration it wasn't available that doesn't mean that they didn't have the Holy Ghost in the portion that it was given that that doesn't that doesn't mean that that they didn't attain the fullness of what was available but if they got that under Wesley or they got that under isua there was always more in front of them not yet revealed there was always more that they needed to press towards there was more steps to go to because it wasn't yet open it wasn't yet available so as a people they were not restored to speaking terms but you you tonight the book is totally open you have the right to stand in fellowship with God you have the right to put your foot on the neck of the devil there is no claim on your life there is no condemnation on your life this message came and it told you where you came from it told you where you were going and not only that it told us where we were and it told us what rights we had the book is open we are restored back to a place of fellowship tonight Hallelujah the atmosphere changed when the seals were open B going to wrap this up but bear with me for about 5 minutes the atmosphere changed when the seals were open listen there's there's nothing to me that points to Fellowship being completely restored and relationship being restored more than God sharing his secrets with us think about it I couldn't tell others but I'm going to tell you all right I couldn't Fellowship about this with them but I'm going to tell you I'm telling you fellowship's restored communication is restored we're back on speaking terms and he comes down and he says this is why I couldn't show them but I'm showing you and there's going to be this portion allotted to these people and this portion allotted and here's where the horse riders went forth and he lays it all out it's like a love letter it's his love secrets and he draws you in close and he says this message has brought you back to a place where I can share all of this with you I couldn't tell them but I can tell you because you're my bride you're my wife you're my sweetheart and you've been restored to a place of fellowship and because of that he begins to share all his secrets with you hallelujah oh the atmosphere changed all the claims are struck off the light is shining Fellowship is restored there's a bride that's been turned to an atmosphere of believing again right here we've been turned to an atmosphere of believing again there's a bride on speaking terms again you can speak to God tonight you can speak to storms tonight you can speak to devils and tell them to go tonight why it's the adoption message and because of that you speaking his word is the same as deity speaking in other words you have checkbook Authority you've been adopted you've been given the token and in this day you are in Fellowship again Hallelujah so it's time that we rise up like Adam would to the storms in your life and say peace be still it's time to rise up and Speak Life to your children that are out wandering around in darkness rise up and and speak to the storms in your life in other words we've been turned back to the faith of God so that we can please God amen I love that he says will I find faith and then he says you can't even please me without it and he requires it and then he supplies it don't we serve an awesome God you've got to have this so here it is you've got to have the token so here it is there's got to be something to turn your heart back to Faith so here it is there's got to be something to catch your attention Sarah and change your attitude so here it is he doesn't require anything that he doesn't supply for you oh there had to be a life I'll give mine there had to be a spotless lamb I'll come and be it there's got to be a debt paid I'll do it somebody's got to come back to relationship again I'll bring them in he requires it and then he provides it hallelujah hallelujah it's a restored word bringing forth a restored people in a restored atmosphere to operate like the first Adam operated to operate like the second Adam operated why it's a restoration and in that restored atmosphere there are Sons and Daughters operating by faith in the word and once again we can speak and it will be so we can create an atmosphere where Satan's not welcome listen we're not subject to atmospheres we're the creator of atmospheres we can create an atmosphere where the sick are healed we can create an atmosphere of deliverance we can create an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost sure Satan can still whip up the Seas he can still come and cause trials and tribulation but when a St a son recognizes where he's at and squares his shoulders back just like the first Adam and just like the second Adam you are now in a position you can stand there and say peace be still you'll not have my children you'll not have my health you'll not have my finances I'm standing in a restored place in a restored atmosphere and I'm on speaking terms with God and when I take his word on my lips it's the same as deity speaking so Satan you go Satan you go you take your leave hallelujah we're taking a Rapture I'm taking my children I've been restored to the place of Eden hallelujah hallelujah think about this musicians you can come then if we can speak the word then we have been restored to a place of fellowship and once we are in Fellowship then there can be relationship and if there can be relationship there can be a marriage how close are we He restored us to a place of Fellowship so that there can be Rel relationship so that there can be a marriage brother brandham says I believe now that you are Jesus Christ the son of God I recognize his blood went before me then the Holy Spirit comes down and a miraculous power transforms your life and picks you up and brings you into the inside of the veil and there you have fellowship with God and commune with him as Adam did in the beginning of the Garden of Eden and God looks down in this last day and he sees people operating again like Adam operated and he sees people operating again like the second Adam operated he sees people controlling atmospheres and not being controlled by them and he says finally it's evening time and after all this time I can come down again in the cool of the evening and he walks with us and he talks with us he meets with us in our bedrooms he meets with us in our cars he meets with us in Services he says oh finally Fellowship again it's the evening time oh it's the cool of the evening and out there it may be chaos but not right here in Eden not right here walking with our Lord not right here restored in Fellowship again oh Hallelujah and in that place we're not subject to atmospheres oh don't worry you said brother A and E fell and the second e e fell this bride's predestinated not to fall you're not going to fall we're just going to keep right on walking with our bridegroom we're just going to keep right on walking till the atmosphere gets right and the atmosphere will produce and he's going to look and he's going to say oh the bride she made herself ready it's Rapture Day we are going to come to a place to where we are so Victorious to where we walk so hand in hand with the bridegroom where we stand in our position so boldly and speak the word that the bride is actually going to create the atmosphere that produces the Rapture he's going to say it's Rapture time she did it she made herself ready she overcame she's walked in the fellowship she's welcom me back she lets me come down in the cool of the evening it's Rapture time it's going home time we're back in Eden again I'd like to tell the devil we're back we're back you held us down for a long time but a message came and we're back we're back in the atmosphere of fellowship with God Almighty we don't have to listen to your lies we don't have to cow down to sickness we don't have to back up from no jant tonight we're back and we're we're saying peace be still take your hands off get out the way we're going up in a Rapture the atmosphere is clear he made the way it's going home time it's going home time Church we've been returned to an atmosphere of Fellowship
