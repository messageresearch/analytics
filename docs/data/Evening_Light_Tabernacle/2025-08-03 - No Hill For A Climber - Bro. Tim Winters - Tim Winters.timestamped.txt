[0:03] We are always facing battles and it's
[0:06] hard to keep the pace cuz Satan never
[0:10] lets up in his fight for winning place.
[0:14] But I have the Lord to guide you every
[0:17] step along the way. So when Satan comes
[0:21] against me, you will always hear me say,
[0:26] "That's no heel for a climb. It's no
[0:29] battle for a child of God. Satan's
[0:32] already been defeated and the victoryy's
[0:36] been won. Jesus won the fight on Calvary
[0:40] when he died for you and me. So now
[0:43] Satan, get behind me, for I claim the
[0:46] victory.
[0:49] Every time I try to do a little
[0:53] something for the Lord,
[0:55] Satan tries to block my path and keep me
[0:58] from my goals.
[1:01] But I don't care how high the heels seem
[1:04] to be today. I'll take my savior by the
[1:08] hand and he'll help me when I say,
[1:12] "Oh, that's no heel for climb. No battle
[1:16] for child of God." Satan's already been
[1:19] defeated and the victory's been won.
[1:23] Jesus won the fight on Calvary when he
[1:26] died for you and me. So now Satan, get
[1:30] behind me for I claim the victory.
[1:35] That's no heel for a climber. It's no
[1:39] battle for a child of God. Satan's
[1:42] already been defeated and the victory's
[1:45] been won. Jesus won the fight on Calvary
[1:49] when he died for you and me. So now
[1:52] Satan get behind me for I claim the
[1:56] victory.
[1:57] [Music]
[1:59] So now Satan get behind me for I claim
[2:04] the victory.
[2:11] [Applause]
