[1:02:52] serving him
[1:02:54] amen it's like it's even much better
[1:02:57] than any kind of insurance policy it
[1:03:00] really pays benefits
[1:03:03] and the benefits are he forgiveth all of
[1:03:07] thine iniquities
[1:03:09] and he heals all of thy diseases
[1:03:13] all inclusive
[1:03:15] every promise
[1:03:16] hallelujah
[1:03:18] it's complete and total redemption

[1:03:25] amen and healing for the body
[1:03:28] that's his benefits
[1:03:30] it's all lays in the atonement
[1:03:33] what he paid for us
[1:03:35] so the next word is and
[1:03:37] it says who redeemeth
[1:03:40] because that's who he is redeemeth thy
[1:03:43] life
[1:03:44] from destruction
[1:03:46] and there are those
[1:03:48] maybe you're lost in sin
[1:03:50] you don't know jesus
[1:03:53] but there's a redeemer from the
[1:03:54] destruction that lays ahead
[1:03:57] and if you're sick
[1:03:59] in your body
[1:04:00] and the devil is sworn he's going to
[1:04:03] destroy you see because he can't destroy
[1:04:05] the word
[1:04:06] so he tries to destroy the vessels the
[1:04:08] word comes in
[1:04:10] so he brings sickness upon the body
[1:04:13] and so but he redeemeth thy life from
[1:04:17] destruction
[1:04:19] and then he does more than that he puts
[1:04:22] a crown on you
[1:04:24] and that crowns with loving kindness and

[1:11:51] amen he's a prayer answering god genesis
[1:11:54] chapter 17 verse 1 and when abram was 90
[1:11:59] years old and nine so now wait a minute
[1:12:01] let's stop here just a minute
[1:12:03] you're never too old for god to do
[1:12:05] something for you
[1:12:08] so never give up on a promise
[1:12:11] no matter you say well i've lived my
[1:12:13] life well that's all right he still is
[1:12:15] the healer of all diseases
[1:12:18] and when abram was 90 years old and nine
[1:12:21] the lord appeared to abram and said unto
[1:12:25] him i am the almighty god
[1:12:27] walk before me and be thou perfect
[1:12:30] and i will make my covenant between me
[1:12:33] and thee and will multiply thee
[1:12:34] exceedingly and abram fell on his face
[1:12:36] and god talked with him saying
[1:12:39] as for me behold my covenant is with
[1:12:41] thee thou shalt be a father of many
[1:12:44] nations neither shalt thou name be any
[1:12:46] more called abram but thy name shall be
[1:12:49] called shall be abraham for a father of
[1:12:52] many nations have i made thee
[1:12:55] and i will make thee exceeding fruitful
[1:12:57] and i will make
[1:12:59] nations of thee and kings shall come out
[1:13:01] of thee and i will establish my covenant
[1:13:05] between me and thee and thy seed after
[1:13:07] thee and their generations for an
[1:13:09] everlasting covenant to be a god unto
[1:13:11] thee and to thy seed after thee
[1:13:14] and i will give unto thee unto thy seed
[1:13:17] after thee the land wherein thou art a
[1:13:19] stranger
[1:13:20] or the land of canaan for an everlasting
[1:13:23] possession and i will be their god
[1:13:27] and god said unto abram
[1:13:29] abraham thou shalt keep my covenant
[1:13:32] therefore thou and thy seed after thee
[1:13:36] in their generations this is my covenant
[1:13:39] which i ye shall keep between me and you
[1:13:42] and thy seed after thee every man child
[1:13:45] among you shall be circumcised
[1:13:48] you shall circumcise the flesh of your
[1:13:50] foreskin
[1:13:51] it shall be a token of the covenant
[1:13:54] between me and you
[1:13:56] and he that is eight days old shall be
[1:13:59] circumcised among you every man child in
[1:14:01] your generation he that is born of the
[1:14:03] house or bought with money of any
[1:14:05] stranger which is not thy seed
[1:14:08] he
[1:14:09] is he that is born in the house and he
[1:14:11] that is bought with money must needs be
[1:14:14] circumcised and my covenant shall be in
[1:14:17] your flesh for an everlasting covenant
[1:14:20] and the under circumcised man-child
[1:14:22] whose flesh of his foreskin is not
[1:14:25] circumcised that soul shall be cut off
[1:14:27] from his people
[1:14:29] he had broken my covenant and god said
[1:14:32] unto abraham as for sarah
[1:14:35] thy wife thou shalt not call her name
[1:14:37] sarai but sarah shall her name be
[1:14:41] and i will bless her and give thee a son
[1:14:45] also of her yea i will bless her and she
[1:14:48] shall be a mother of nation kings the
[1:14:50] people shall be of her
[1:14:52] then abraham fell upon his face and
[1:14:54] laughed and said in his heart shall a
[1:14:55] child be born unto him that is a hundred
[1:14:58] years old and shall sarah that is 90
[1:15:01] years old bear
[1:15:03] and abraham said unto god all that
[1:15:05] ishmael might live before thee
[1:15:08] and god said sarah thy wife shall bear
[1:15:11] thee a son indeed and thou shalt call
[1:15:13] his name isaac and i will establish my
[1:15:16] covenant with him for an everlasting
[1:15:18] covenant and with his seed after him and
[1:15:21] as for ishmael i have heard thee behold
[1:15:24] i have blessed him and will make him
[1:15:26] fruitful and will multiply him
[1:15:29] exceedingly twelve princes shall he
[1:15:31] beget and i will make him a great nation
[1:15:34] but my covenant will establish with
[1:15:36] isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee
[1:15:39] at this set
[1:15:41] time
[1:15:42] in the next year and he left off talking
[1:15:45] with him and god went up from abraham
[1:15:48] god bless you you can be seated
[1:15:51] now we have been through abraham's
[1:15:53] journey
[1:15:58] again there's a hedon like the rest of
[1:16:01] the world
[1:16:15] we got a new microphone in it
[1:16:18] different way to wear it
[1:16:21] i hope you all are happy
[1:16:24] that's not better that's worse
[1:16:30] all right
[1:16:32] so we have been through abraham's
[1:16:34] journey with god and he began as a
[1:16:36] heathen like the rest of the world and
[1:16:38] was called out by god to walk with him
[1:16:41] now we've been through it the divine
[1:16:43] call was justification and every person
[1:16:46] comes to that place where that by faith
[1:16:50] they receive god's righteousness
[1:16:52] and forgiveness for their sins
[1:16:55] later he brings him to the altar where
[1:16:57] he was sanctified through the blood
[1:16:59] offering but now at 99 you would think
[1:17:03] his journey is complete
[1:17:05] but god is actually just now going to
[1:17:07] fulfill
[1:17:09] his purpose in abraham's life
[1:17:12] and here god reveals himself as almighty
[1:17:16] god and in the hebrew this is called el
[1:17:19] shaddai
[1:17:21] now
[1:17:21] as he said in genesis 71 and when abram
[1:17:24] was 90 and years old and nine the lord
[1:17:27] appeared to abram and said unto him i am
[1:17:31] the almighty god
[1:17:33] walk before me and be thou perfect
[1:17:36] and this word almighty god as we said
[1:17:39] hebrew in the hebrew is el shaddai
[1:17:42] it comes from the root word and then
[1:17:44] that root word is the word shad
[1:17:48] and it comes from the word meaning
[1:17:50] breast
[1:17:51] now
[1:17:53] there was
[1:17:54] god ex
[1:17:56] expounding and revealing himself now as
[1:17:59] the almighty or the strength giver
[1:18:02] and yet there was already a child that
[1:18:05] had come from abraham's strength
[1:18:08] which was ishmael
[1:18:10] but here god wants one born of the
[1:18:13] supernatural out of god's strength
[1:18:16] and
[1:18:17] and to be born of the supernatural is to
[1:18:20] be born of the work
[1:18:23] and and uh so to be born of the word is
[1:18:26] god will show himself in full strength
[1:18:29] saying i am the almighty i am god that
[1:18:33] is more than enough
[1:18:34] i am god that is in full strength
[1:18:39] now this is where that we are in this
[1:18:42] hour we are not in a day where there is
[1:18:45] a partial
[1:18:46] revelation of god but this is the hour
[1:18:49] and the day of the fullness of the
[1:18:51] revelation of god
[1:18:53] whether we are not in a time of partial
[1:18:55] truth but where the fullness of the word
[1:18:58] is being made manifest
[1:19:01] now in seed not error with the shock
[1:19:03] brother branham tells us that this
[1:19:05] happens at the opening of the seven
[1:19:07] seals revelation 10 that the full word
[1:19:11] is to be born
[1:19:13] into manifestation again
[1:19:15] vindicated by the spirit of god in the
[1:19:17] full strength as it was when he was here
[1:19:20] on earth manifested in the same way
[1:19:22] doing the same things that it did when
[1:19:24] he was on when it was on earth amen
[1:19:27] hebrews 13 8 said jesus christ is the
[1:19:30] same yesterday today and forever luke 17
[1:19:34] 30 jesus said in the days in the last
[1:19:36] days as it was in the days of sodom when
[1:19:39] the son of man will be revealing himself
[1:19:42] again it will be the same thing
[1:19:47] so you see again it's a time where the
[1:19:49] full word has been born into
[1:19:52] manifestation because we're not in the
[1:19:55] hour where the book is closed
[1:19:57] and some of it of truth held in
[1:20:00] obscurity
[1:20:01] but we're in a day in the hour where
[1:20:03] that the word comes fully revealed
[1:20:07] and fully manifested making him jesus
[1:20:11] christ the same as he was yesterday
[1:20:14] and and so there have been many many
[1:20:17] misconceptions
[1:20:18] through the ages and part of the word
[1:20:21] revealed
[1:20:22] but now
[1:20:23] you see the things changes you see we
[1:20:26] had conceptions before that that wasn't
[1:20:29] right we had misunderstandings that
[1:20:31] wasn't true
[1:20:33] but that was before the fullness of the
[1:20:35] word came to into existence or the
[1:20:38] opening of the seventh seal
[1:20:40] so you see we've moved from a time from
[1:20:43] partial revelation to full revelation
[1:20:47] and so here was exactly what god was
[1:20:49] doing with abram he had revealed himself
[1:20:52] and justification in the divine call he
[1:20:55] had revealed himself in sanctification
[1:20:58] in the blood offering but now he's going
[1:21:00] to reveal himself in his fullness
[1:21:04] and here now the real plan of god will
[1:21:07] come into view
[1:21:09] now of course you know we are in the
[1:21:12] very hour of christ's return
[1:21:15] amen
[1:21:16] amen so again even as there was the
[1:21:19] appearing of christ our god in the days
[1:21:22] of abraham and here he comes and reveals
[1:21:25] himself in a greater way in a greater
[1:21:27] way and and many different aspects that
[1:21:30] he will make himself and i want to make
[1:21:32] something clear to you no matter how
[1:21:34] many times that god revealed to him
[1:21:37] himself in different forms and different
[1:21:40] ways abraham never got confused as to
[1:21:43] who god was or who god is he never made
[1:21:46] him a trinity or four or five and so now
[1:21:50] this is five different ones of him but
[1:21:53] he saw it was all the same god unveiling
[1:21:56] himself in a greater way
[1:21:59] amen so you see it never made a
[1:22:01] trinitarian out of my heathen out him
[1:22:04] because you see he had been a heathen
[1:22:07] but now the revelation comes of the one
[1:22:10] god
[1:22:11] and now with many different
[1:22:13] manifestations of that same god
[1:22:16] appearing now you know
[1:22:19] in the past he'd appeared as melchizedek
[1:22:22] and he had appeared as um as jehovah and
[1:22:25] he made many different appearance to him
[1:22:27] but now he comes and he says i am going
[1:22:30] to reveal myself as the almighty
[1:22:35] amen as the almighty god
[1:22:39] as the one who's going to give you
[1:22:41] strength
[1:22:42] in your old age oh brother we need that
[1:22:45] in this day
[1:22:47] church has been around for a long long
[1:22:49] time we've come through seven ages but
[1:22:52] we've got to have a strength giver in
[1:22:54] this day
[1:22:55] we'll never make it without him we'll
[1:22:57] never bring back christ to the earth
[1:22:59] without the strength giver
[1:23:02] now so it is the coming of christ that
[1:23:06] we're talking about in our last day
[1:23:08] listen in the message the trial and i
[1:23:11] want to get i want to just preference
[1:23:13] what i'm going to go into in a moment
[1:23:15] but in the message the trial in 64
[1:23:17] brother branham's
[1:23:18] quotes again jesus promise as it was in
[1:23:21] the days of noah as it was in the days
[1:23:24] of lot it would be in the last day we
[1:23:26] got it here it's here it's already
[1:23:29] vindicated just how many scriptures in
[1:23:31] the sodom age what happened to abraham
[1:23:33] would return back again to abraham's
[1:23:36] royal seed which is which is in christ
[1:23:40] christ returning in the form of his word
[1:23:46] amen
[1:23:47] so now i want to give a thought to you
[1:23:49] for a moment his returning
[1:23:51] then is going to be much different from
[1:23:54] the misconceptions of the reformers
[1:23:58] now before we go anywhere i'm not doing
[1:24:00] away with the literal physical coming of
[1:24:02] jesus christ
[1:24:04] when we go anywhere we are going to have
[1:24:06] a meeting in the air
[1:24:08] but i want you to understand that that
[1:24:11] christ returning is much different from
[1:24:15] the misconceptions
[1:24:16] of those before us in the past
[1:24:19] you see they thought that come the lord
[1:24:21] was as a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:24:24] now that's the change of the body
[1:24:27] from mortal to immortal you see that
[1:24:29] happens in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:24:32] an eye we shall all be changed when
[1:24:34] how in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:24:38] but we found there and brother branham
[1:24:40] goes over this in the rapture message he
[1:24:42] said he does three things as he descends
[1:24:47] so there's not just one aspect of his
[1:24:50] coming
[1:24:51] but there are now three aspects of his
[1:24:54] coming
[1:24:55] and of course as he does there is a
[1:24:58] shout there is the voice and there of
[1:25:01] the of the archangel and then the trump
[1:25:03] of god and we know rapt the trump of god
[1:25:06] at the last trump the dead in christ
[1:25:08] rise
[1:25:09] so we know the other two then happened
[1:25:12] before that the resurrection of the
[1:25:15] saints
[1:25:16] amen so he descends from heaven with a
[1:25:19] shout
[1:25:20] so how could he judge the world and take
[1:25:22] some in a rapture while leaving others
[1:25:25] behind
[1:25:26] yet and there's necessary parts of his
[1:25:29] word that is still hidden in obscurity
[1:25:33] still darkened by misconceptions
[1:25:35] still clouded by unbelief how can he
[1:25:38] come
[1:25:39] and just come get a bride come get a
[1:25:42] people come back like he said and yet
[1:25:45] much of his word is not revealed
[1:25:48] are you with me so before his physical
[1:25:52] corporal comment he has to descend
[1:25:55] with the open book
[1:25:58] amen the word has to be restored
[1:26:02] amen so he said i will pour out my
[1:26:05] spirit in the last days how many
[1:26:07] believes were part of that amen and he
[1:26:10] did and as he did he descends pouring
[1:26:13] out the spirit he descends from heaven
[1:26:17] with a shout
[1:26:19] out amen now you say brother tim i you
[1:26:22] know how how in the world can we really
[1:26:24] look at that well go back to the days of
[1:26:26] of moses
[1:26:28] and what what did he say to moses in the
[1:26:30] burning bush i have come down
[1:26:34] to deliver you
[1:26:37] is that right amen now the people didn't
[1:26:40] see so much the burning bush but they
[1:26:42] saw a prophet anointed by the burning
[1:26:45] bush with a message of
[1:26:48] deliverance amen but what was it it was
[1:26:51] god coming down
[1:26:53] god descending with a message sent by
[1:26:57] prophet
[1:26:58] to bring an exodus
[1:27:01] where are we in the south
[1:27:04] god's done some extraordinary things in
[1:27:06] our age
[1:27:08] to bring you here to this point to
[1:27:10] durian in time
[1:27:13] now this is
[1:27:15] again
[1:27:16] again he said i will pour out my spirit
[1:27:19] and as he does he descends from heaven
[1:27:22] with a shout
[1:27:23] now it's a message
[1:27:25] this shout is not god screaming
[1:27:29] are you with me
[1:27:31] it's not just uh a whoop or a yell
[1:27:35] it's it's saying something
[1:27:39] it's saying something
[1:27:41] it's a clear message
[1:27:45] you know again it's it's not going to be
[1:27:47] hidden it's a loud it's a loud message
[1:27:51] it's a shout out
[1:27:53] amen this was the word returning and
[1:27:56] that which was sealed up now revealed
[1:28:00] sealed up now is revealed and opened
[1:28:03] and this was again not his corporal
[1:28:05] coming this was the word
[1:28:07] returning
[1:28:09] and return it did it returned in his
[1:28:12] full power
[1:28:14] i want you to get it in its full power i
[1:28:17] am almighty god
[1:28:19] amen this is a time of fullness
[1:28:22] this is a time of power so it returned
[1:28:25] in its full power
[1:28:26] it healed the sick it raised the dead it
[1:28:30] casts out devils it deserved the hearts
[1:28:34] hallelujah because it's the word not a
[1:28:37] theology
[1:28:38] but the word make it jesus christ to say
[1:28:41] yesterday today and forever coming in
[1:28:45] his full power
[1:28:47] hallelujah healing every kind of
[1:28:49] sickness
[1:28:50] bringing making demons to flee
[1:28:53] ain't been casting out devils amen bring
[1:28:56] them bring it back again the truth of
[1:28:58] the word of god but it didn't just come
[1:29:00] in word only it came with power it came
[1:29:03] with much assurance
[1:29:05] [Applause]
[1:29:08] i don't need me to explain it it didn't
[1:29:10] need joseph coleman to bring it clarity
[1:29:12] it didn't need veil as a teacher to help
[1:29:15] him say it more clearer than he could
[1:29:17] say it it doesn't need theology
[1:29:19] theologians and schools of divinity's
[1:29:22] opinion amen god was his own interpreter
[1:29:27] and he used the prophet to bring it
[1:29:29] [Applause]
[1:29:32] now
[1:29:33] let's go just for a moment to revelation
[1:29:35] 10 verse 1 and i'm going to take and
[1:29:38] just type for a moment this this thought
[1:29:41] of first thessalonians 4 with this
[1:29:43] scripture
[1:29:45] and i saw another mighty angel
[1:29:48] now brother brandon when he he reads
[1:29:50] this he said only christ this could be
[1:29:54] but you see it's not jesus
[1:29:57] it is the holy spirit
[1:29:59] coming now and he's the messenger of his
[1:30:02] own
[1:30:03] covenant
[1:30:06] he didn't trust it with an archangel he
[1:30:09] didn't trust it with anyone he comes
[1:30:11] himself
[1:30:13] descending from heaven watch another
[1:30:16] mighty angel come down from heaven
[1:30:18] clothed with a cloud a rainbow was upon
[1:30:20] his head showing the seven
[1:30:23] gold seven colors of his rainbow the
[1:30:25] complete covenant
[1:30:28] and his face were as it were the sun no
[1:30:31] clouds upon it
[1:30:33] it's here now the word in his fullness
[1:30:36] and his fetus pillars of fire
[1:30:39] and he had in his hand a little book
[1:30:42] that was closed
[1:30:44] now open
[1:30:46] and he sets his foot up on the up on the
[1:30:49] sea and his left foot upon the earth and
[1:30:51] he cried what's his words now he cried
[1:30:55] with a loud voice
[1:30:57] again
[1:30:58] it's not a boohoo
[1:31:00] you don't have to hand him a kleenex
[1:31:04] i want you to get the thought
[1:31:06] he does what he cried
[1:31:09] with a loud voice
[1:31:11] as when a lion roared
[1:31:14] the king is speaking
[1:31:16] we've had seven church ages
[1:31:20] we've had complete ideas of man over and
[1:31:23] over and over again
[1:31:25] remember we have libraries and and
[1:31:29] uh full of books and every kind of
[1:31:31] school of divinity in the world but look
[1:31:34] here now the king is speaking
[1:31:37] we've had men speaking
[1:31:39] but now god is speaking
[1:31:42] and he cries with a loud voice as when a
[1:31:44] lion roared in other words he gave a
[1:31:47] loud shout yes
[1:31:52] now we're right back to first
[1:31:53] thessalonians 4. he gave allow to shout
[1:31:57] like the roar of a lion
[1:32:01] amen when he does he hustles every other
[1:32:03] voice
[1:32:05] but it releases the voice of god
[1:32:08] and when he cries seven thunders uttered
[1:32:10] their voices in other words when he
[1:32:13] shouted in that shout the voices of
[1:32:17] seven thunder spoke yes
[1:32:22] utter their message
[1:32:24] in distinct words
[1:32:27] what had been sealed and closed up in
[1:32:29] other ages
[1:32:31] is now revealed
[1:32:33] now john was going to write it and god
[1:32:35] said no john this is not to be made
[1:32:38] known to the end time so i want you to
[1:32:40] seal this up
[1:32:42] but when you come to the fullness of
[1:32:44] times
[1:32:45] when the ages have run out
[1:32:48] when you get down to the last age
[1:32:50] then the mysteries of god will be
[1:32:52] finished or revealed and made known
[1:32:56] now this was the same as daniel daniel
[1:32:59] said i heard it but not with
[1:33:01] understanding
[1:33:02] so he says in daniel 12 9 the words are
[1:33:05] closed up and sealed to the
[1:33:07] time of the end and many will be
[1:33:09] purified and made white and tried but
[1:33:11] the wicked shall do wickedly and none of
[1:33:14] the wicked shall understand but the wise
[1:33:16] shall understand
[1:33:18] so he says there's coming and
[1:33:20] understanding
[1:33:22] to things that i can't understand now
[1:33:26] and that's what john was saying an
[1:33:28] understanding i'm not able to reveal is
[1:33:31] going to be reserved to the last day
[1:33:34] and i'm going to finish it up i'm going
[1:33:36] to finish the mysteries
[1:33:41] for in revelation 10 7
[1:33:44] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:33:46] angel when he shall begin to sound
[1:33:49] the mystery of god should be finished
[1:33:52] as he had declared all down to the ages
[1:33:55] to the servants of prophets
[1:33:57] now this
[1:33:59] you know is a is a big surprise to a lot
[1:34:02] of people
[1:34:03] they look
[1:34:04] to see
[1:34:05] and look to see another great
[1:34:08] for brother branham's crowning of his
[1:34:10] ministry another great divine healing
[1:34:12] campaign
[1:34:14] they look for another times of greater
[1:34:17] gifts and greater miracles
[1:34:19] but the third phase of the third pull of
[1:34:21] brother battle's ministry he would
[1:34:23] explain it like this as he looked back
[1:34:25] over it and anointed once in the end
[1:34:27] time he said notice the very day when
[1:34:30] this messenger
[1:34:31] not when he starts on but when he begins
[1:34:34] to declare his message see the first
[1:34:37] pull was healing the second pull
[1:34:39] prophesying the third pull the opening
[1:34:42] of the word the mysteries revealed
[1:34:45] no more there's no more higher order to
[1:34:47] reveal the word than prophets but the
[1:34:49] only way a prophet can be
[1:34:52] vindicated is by the word and remember
[1:34:55] the third po was
[1:34:58] the third po was
[1:35:01] the first the third phase of my ministry
[1:35:04] was
[1:35:05] the opening of them seven seals to
[1:35:08] reveal the hidden truths that's been
[1:35:10] sealed in the word
[1:35:13] now notice people are claiming the
[1:35:15] opening of the word and yet much is
[1:35:18] close to them
[1:35:19] they close the door of mercy
[1:35:22] sealing up and shutting down divine
[1:35:24] healing
[1:35:26] miracles
[1:35:27] the baptism of the holy ghost the power
[1:35:30] of god come on
[1:35:32] actually instead of opening the word
[1:35:34] many have taken it to close the word
[1:35:39] now when the book was opened to john he
[1:35:43] saw his name in the promise
[1:35:45] and it caused emotions to rise
[1:35:48] amen it caused him to wring out praises
[1:35:53] to the lamb who opened the seals
[1:35:56] the opening of the word actually causes
[1:35:58] the word to live
[1:36:02] it opens up a fountain
[1:36:04] of living water
[1:36:06] it releases everything in god's promises
[1:36:11] amen it becomes a bounty support
[1:36:14] bountiful supply of the holy ghost
[1:36:18] now what brother branham said in white
[1:36:20] little bethlehem he said
[1:36:22] we bypass on creeds and drinking
[1:36:24] stagnated waters from cisterns
[1:36:28] what we need today is an opening of the
[1:36:31] word that lives
[1:36:34] so we preach their word is open but is
[1:36:37] it living
[1:36:41] are you with me now
[1:36:43] it's got to live
[1:36:44] if the word is open to you then the
[1:36:47] fullness of the word lays right there
[1:36:51] for healing deliver salvation
[1:36:54] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:36:57] every promise in the book the rapture
[1:36:59] lays in and everything lays in that
[1:37:02] somebody with me now
[1:37:04] amen what we need is an opening of the
[1:37:07] word that lives
[1:37:09] and he's the same yesterday today and
[1:37:12] forever
[1:37:13] he cannot fail some call it
[1:37:15] telepathy they say whatever they want to
[1:37:17] or spiritualists or devils as long as
[1:37:20] that word is flowing free and producing
[1:37:23] exactly what it said it would it is a
[1:37:26] fountain in the house of david back in
[1:37:28] bethlehem where that jesus christ the
[1:37:31] same yesterday today and forever to his
[1:37:34] bethlehem dwellers
[1:37:36] live with it live in it it's life
[1:37:38] journeying water for us as israel had
[1:37:42] amen
[1:37:44] so again you see an opening of the word
[1:37:47] that lives
[1:37:49] a lot of what we're calling opening of
[1:37:51] the word isn't the opening of the word
[1:37:53] it's the closing of the word
[1:37:55] it shuts down divine healing it shuts
[1:37:58] down the holy ghost it shuts down the
[1:38:00] power of god somebody with me remember
[1:38:03] when the word is open it lives
[1:38:07] when it's really open
[1:38:09] amen it brings out life-giving water if
[1:38:12] you're sick you can drink from it if you
[1:38:15] lost it'll find you ain't now whatever
[1:38:18] the need is it was there because it's a
[1:38:20] life-giving water
[1:38:24] [Applause]
[1:38:26] a bountiful supply
[1:38:29] more than enough not just enough
[1:38:33] more than enough
[1:38:36] now the message
[1:38:38] of malachi 4
[1:38:41] brings the birth
[1:38:43] of the word
[1:38:45] now
[1:38:47] for it turns
[1:38:49] the heart
[1:38:51] see you got to see it's a new birth
[1:38:54] because it turns the heart
[1:38:58] and and it bursts a people
[1:39:00] who can believe
[1:39:02] oh
[1:39:04] the word
[1:39:06] that it returned back to the original
[1:39:09] faith
[1:39:10] now out of the word the original faith
[1:39:13] the message
[1:39:14] comes a people born of the word who are
[1:39:18] the word made flesh
[1:39:21] in his fullness
[1:39:24] now
[1:39:25] i'm taking you
[1:39:26] now just for a moment let's just make
[1:39:29] the transfer
[1:39:30] we are moving now from revelation being
[1:39:33] given
[1:39:35] to a word becoming flesh
[1:39:39] because this bible this word this open
[1:39:42] book this message you receive is no good
[1:39:46] unless it becomes flesh
[1:39:51] it's got to live
[1:39:54] now in birth pains brother branham would
[1:39:56] tell us some messages to bring back the
[1:39:59] word bring the people back to the word
[1:40:01] birth to be she has to be delivered of a
[1:40:04] new birth according to malachi ford so
[1:40:08] from malachi 4 comes a birth and it's a
[1:40:11] birth of a word but out of that word
[1:40:13] comes a people
[1:40:16] as he says in birth pains
[1:40:18] the word must deliver the word bride
[1:40:22] church
[1:40:23] the church has got to be delivered out
[1:40:26] of her a bride for christ
[1:40:28] so the word must deliver or
[1:40:32] birth
[1:40:34] a word
[1:40:35] bride church
[1:40:37] we cannot be a people that just say well
[1:40:40] hallelujah we got the message and we got
[1:40:43] our collection of books and we got our
[1:40:45] tapes and we got all of this and that's
[1:40:48] it no it's got to birth
[1:40:51] a word born church
[1:40:55] he said she's fixing to bring forth the
[1:40:58] perfect word back there now again
[1:41:01] he's making it clear it won't be a
[1:41:03] parcel where the word in its perfection
[1:41:07] and the word is coming forth the word
[1:41:10] bride
[1:41:11] as a woman is a part of the man taken
[1:41:13] from him so that will the church be a
[1:41:15] word abiding church every word of the
[1:41:18] bible not system dogmas nothing added to
[1:41:21] it it'll have to be an unadulterated
[1:41:25] pure virgin word
[1:41:29] now isn't that something as a
[1:41:32] shout-finish sound in his message
[1:41:35] the voice of the resurrection begins
[1:41:38] all right
[1:41:40] let me say that again
[1:41:42] as the shout
[1:41:44] finishes this message
[1:41:47] and out of that mysteries are revealed
[1:41:51] silence is broken on scriptures that
[1:41:53] have been held in silence for years and
[1:41:55] years
[1:41:57] are you with me
[1:41:59] you see we're we're not living in the
[1:42:01] days of the silence
[1:42:03] we're living in the days of the voice
[1:42:06] word that the silence now become what
[1:42:09] was silenced and shut up now becomes the
[1:42:11] voice
[1:42:15] now
[1:42:16] and as it as the shout
[1:42:19] finishes sound his message
[1:42:21] the voice of the resurrection begins
[1:42:25] but where does it begin
[1:42:27] it begins by resurrecting a people out
[1:42:30] of dark cold denominationalism
[1:42:33] out of the tombs of the religion
[1:42:35] of people who can say i was dead
[1:42:40] come on i was dead i was in the tombs of
[1:42:43] religion i was dead i was dead in sins
[1:42:46] and trespasses i was dead in unbelief i
[1:42:49] was dead and false doctrine but not no
[1:42:51] more behold i am alive forevermore
[1:42:57] and i have the keys
[1:43:00] that will unlock every dollar of health
[1:43:03] [Applause]
[1:43:05] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[1:43:07] us
[1:43:08] now this is this is so incredible
[1:43:12] the word actually bursts a bride
[1:43:17] and this this is
[1:43:19] this is the same
[1:43:21] it's just more of
[1:43:23] the descending of the mighty angel
[1:43:26] it's just more of the rapture that is
[1:43:29] going on
[1:43:31] amen first it comes as the word
[1:43:35] a message coming to a prophet and then
[1:43:37] is transfers and goes into the next face
[1:43:41] where it comes a voice in the people
[1:43:46] now as the book transfers from the hand
[1:43:48] of the angel it transfers to the hand of
[1:43:51] john
[1:43:52] remember in revelation 10 80 said don't
[1:43:54] take the little book out of the hand of
[1:43:56] the angel
[1:43:57] so therefore there comes a time where
[1:43:59] the book becomes your promise
[1:44:03] hallelujah the book becomes your
[1:44:05] inheritance
[1:44:07] i'm talking about the book that john
[1:44:09] wasn't worthy to look at
[1:44:12] but once it's taken by the lamb and the
[1:44:15] lamb has done his intercessory work he
[1:44:17] didn't keep it for himself but he comes
[1:44:19] down
[1:44:20] with the open book
[1:44:23] to make a transfer
[1:44:25] to all the seed of abraham
[1:44:27] [Applause]
[1:44:29] the royal seed
[1:44:31] now it's christ returning
[1:44:35] but not as a shout
[1:44:37] it's not in a prophet
[1:44:39] people are saying we got the word the
[1:44:40] word the word
[1:44:42] we got the word and i'm going to say we
[1:44:44] do have the word
[1:44:46] but christ has now returned in the
[1:44:48] church
[1:44:49] listen to me
[1:44:51] as the same bride
[1:44:53] she was in the book of acts
[1:44:56] at pentecost
[1:44:59] so the word before there can be a bride
[1:45:02] taken
[1:45:03] the word's got to produce one that's
[1:45:05] right
[1:45:05] that's right
[1:45:07] come on
[1:45:08] and now out of the word has got to come
[1:45:10] a people
[1:45:12] and they've got to be that word made
[1:45:14] flesh or made manifest
[1:45:18] now
[1:45:19] as he said in the identification of
[1:45:21] christ is god manifested in flesh
[1:45:25] now in the flesh of his bride for the
[1:45:28] bride and her husband is the self same
[1:45:30] flesh these two are one
[1:45:32] and the church is becoming the bride all
[1:45:33] the time by believing the word so that
[1:45:36] the word in the church becomes the same
[1:45:38] the word in the church making it the
[1:45:40] bride the last sign god identified
[1:45:42] himself the to the word in the church
[1:45:46] now
[1:45:47] now again the church becoming the bride
[1:45:50] by believing the word so that the word
[1:45:54] and the church becomes the same
[1:45:56] amen now
[1:45:58] so as a wheat plant has to go from grain
[1:46:02] back to head of grain
[1:46:05] so must the word bride head up into the
[1:46:08] person of the word of god
[1:46:10] so this last day people will be the
[1:46:14] fullness of the word
[1:46:20] not a partial word express
[1:46:22] the whole word expressed
[1:46:24] hang tight with me i'm just laying some
[1:46:26] background here
[1:46:28] other ages of that reformation
[1:46:30] but this is not a reformation
[1:46:33] this is a restoration
[1:46:35] a matter of restoration what of the
[1:46:37] original seed that was planted so you
[1:46:40] see down to the the you know the corn of
[1:46:43] wheat that but died at nicaea rotted in
[1:46:45] the dark ages is now shot shot up a
[1:46:49] shoot of truth in luther
[1:46:51] it grew on there but at the end of the
[1:46:53] laodicean age where we're at just before
[1:46:57] jesus came the church goes back to being
[1:47:00] the wheat seed bride again
[1:47:04] amen hallelujah
[1:47:06] now again he says in god of this evil
[1:47:09] age word bride heading up in the person
[1:47:12] of the word of god made manifest in this
[1:47:15] evil age that we're living in
[1:47:17] so the bride will be the person of the
[1:47:21] word made
[1:47:23] manifest
[1:47:25] manifesting
[1:47:26] all the work
[1:47:28] every promise
[1:47:30] every gift
[1:47:32] all his righteousness
[1:47:34] all of his holiness
[1:47:36] amen everything there will be living
[1:47:39] epistles
[1:47:41] in other words the living word
[1:47:44] we're not talking about now listen i i
[1:47:47] just want to say it whatever's in your
[1:47:49] library can't live
[1:47:52] but what's in your heart can live
[1:47:55] amen and it makes the people born of the
[1:47:58] word and they have power
[1:48:02] amen a living word a living bride a word
[1:48:05] that vibrates with power a pride that
[1:48:08] pulsates with life
[1:48:11] amen
[1:48:12] see he would say
[1:48:15] he said and we would see jesus see your
[1:48:17] written epistle of god a real true born
[1:48:20] again christian is the word expressed
[1:48:23] again
[1:48:24] because you're written epistles read of
[1:48:26] all men what what type of a person
[1:48:29] should we be if we know that our lives
[1:48:32] is an open living bible to the
[1:48:35] unbeliever
[1:48:37] you can't you see that the bride becomes
[1:48:39] an open living bible
[1:48:43] so we're talking about now the open book
[1:48:45] we're not just talking about a sermon
[1:48:46] brother brad and preach we're talking
[1:48:48] about a people that it produced
[1:48:51] amen a people who is the open living
[1:48:54] book
[1:48:55] they are the fulfillment of all the
[1:48:57] prophecies
[1:48:59] can't you see them that the bride
[1:49:01] becomes the open living book how did
[1:49:03] this do it revelation 10 8 says they do
[1:49:06] it by eating the book
[1:49:08] amen and they by eating the book or to
[1:49:11] express them the fullness
[1:49:14] of god
[1:49:16] once again because what happens by
[1:49:18] eating the word makes you prophesy
[1:49:23] in other words the word has got to come
[1:49:25] out of that people
[1:49:28] it's got to express itself
[1:49:30] it's got to express healing it's got to
[1:49:32] express miracles it's got to express the
[1:49:35] holy ghost it's got to express the the
[1:49:38] power of god
[1:49:39] it's more than a doctor and it's a life
[1:49:43] it's a power
[1:49:45] are you with me church
[1:49:46] live an epistle epistles that are living
[1:49:52] we got epistles written in the bible but
[1:49:54] you are to be the living epistle
[1:49:57] amen epistles that's living that's been
[1:49:59] written and now living out the word of
[1:50:02] god
[1:50:03] oh my we receive many epistles from the
[1:50:06] prophet of god we got tape loads up of
[1:50:08] pencils of truth amen but that's got to
[1:50:11] become a living epistle
[1:50:13] a living word a living power and a
[1:50:16] living people and a living pride
[1:50:23] people that are living out the word they
[1:50:25] are the manifestation of the promise
[1:50:28] now
[1:50:29] the true born-again church in this hour
[1:50:32] is the living word of god
[1:50:35] it is the word of god in his age made
[1:50:37] manifest
[1:50:39] search the scriptures and see what's
[1:50:40] supposed to be happening in this age
[1:50:42] brother branham says there is christ
[1:50:44] living again just changing his mass from
[1:50:48] one to the other amen
[1:50:50] what's now changing his mask from one to
[1:50:54] another
[1:50:55] he was once in luther
[1:50:58] but he changed his mask
[1:51:00] and revealed himself in leslie
[1:51:03] and then he changed his mask
[1:51:05] and he was in the azusa pentecostal
[1:51:08] meeting
[1:51:09] and then he changed his mask and came
[1:51:11] into the healing revival
[1:51:13] but then he changed his mask
[1:51:16] to come into a word revival
[1:51:18] and now he's changed his mask again and
[1:51:21] is in bright form
[1:51:26] and she is the interpretation of the
[1:51:29] words
[1:51:31] yes sir
[1:51:33] see the discrepancies that jesus was the
[1:51:36] the interpretation of the word he said
[1:51:38] stretch the scriptures in them you think
[1:51:39] you have eternal life they're not
[1:51:41] justified to you they're testifying to
[1:51:43] me
[1:51:44] he was the interpretation of the word
[1:51:46] and every born again son and daughter of
[1:51:48] god of this age is the interpretation of
[1:51:52] the word
[1:51:54] hallelujah you want to know what divine
[1:51:56] healing is that's interpretational word
[1:51:59] remember when we saw the atlanta healed
[1:52:01] of cancer
[1:52:02] when we seen drew walk when we see blind
[1:52:05] eyes come back open with sister karen
[1:52:08] when we see god move time on time and
[1:52:10] time again
[1:52:12] what was it that is what god thinks
[1:52:14] about divine healing i'm still the same
[1:52:17] i'm still the healer i'm still the
[1:52:19] deliverer
[1:52:22] hallelujah amen you want to see you want
[1:52:25] to know what his interpretation is of
[1:52:28] the holy ghost i'll tell you look at our
[1:52:30] young people look at one's like aaron
[1:52:33] that was insane that god transformed
[1:52:35] their lives hey man look at you look at
[1:52:38] me we are the interpretation
[1:52:43] the
[1:52:44] interpretation of that word
[1:52:48] a written epistle
[1:52:50] written in our lives
[1:52:52] read of all men
[1:52:55] now 2 000 years ago
[1:52:58] at the culmination at the climax at the
[1:53:02] crowning moment
[1:53:04] of the old covenant the old testament
[1:53:08] the word
[1:53:10] was made manifest in a body
[1:53:14] in the man christ jesus the fullness
[1:53:18] of the godhead
[1:53:20] every expression of god was in him
[1:53:26] the fullness
[1:53:28] we know that it wasn't the second person
[1:53:31] it was the person
[1:53:33] come on now
[1:53:34] we've got a one god bible
[1:53:38] all the way down through the bible he's
[1:53:39] a one god
[1:53:41] that's a way you know brother branham
[1:53:42] didn't bring a trinity of gods he didn't
[1:53:45] bring a senior god in a junior god
[1:53:49] a man or a senior god and and the man is
[1:53:51] he just a man you know he's just a
[1:53:54] another human like us no he showed one
[1:53:57] god
[1:53:58] god above us god with us god in us

[1:54:04] god was made known

[1:54:14] the anointed that was anointed with the
[1:54:17] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:54:21] amen oh how could we doubt that
[1:54:24] how could we question it
[1:54:26] after hearing and i haven't revealed how
[1:54:28] could we get somebody confusing us with
[1:54:30] two jehovah's two jesus's
[1:54:33] truth isn't true that
[1:54:36] come on now
[1:54:38] amen god made it clear to us
[1:54:41] amen that the fullness of the godhead
[1:54:43] bodily dwelt in christ
[1:54:46] where once moses partly had him and
[1:54:49] partly david had him and where but now
[1:54:52] he was manifested on earth
[1:54:54] deity himself standing on the earth god
[1:54:57] in his fullness
[1:54:59] to die for the sin of the people that he
[1:55:02] might bring this church a sanctified
[1:55:04] life
[1:55:05] that he might have the preeminence and
[1:55:07] fullness in his church
[1:55:09] that he
[1:55:11] in his in his church to manifest every
[1:55:14] promise somebody say every promise
[1:55:17] in this last day before he promised that
[1:55:19] for the last day
[1:55:20] so here we are again christ did all of
[1:55:23] that to sanctify a people
[1:55:27] amen so that he might have the
[1:55:30] preeminence in them and what's getting
[1:55:32] in fullness in them amen manifests every
[1:55:36] promise for the last day every promise
[1:55:40] every promise
[1:55:42] every promise
[1:55:44] now at the end of the ages
[1:55:46] at the culmination
[1:55:48] at the climax
[1:55:50] at the crowning moment somebody with me
[1:55:53] amen in the crowded moment now of the
[1:55:56] new testament we've had seven church
[1:55:58] ages
[1:55:59] we come now to the end of the new
[1:56:01] covenant
[1:56:02] we're here at the end with the the
[1:56:05] dispensation of the fullness of time
[1:56:08] you know all the word is made manifest
[1:56:10] in a body
[1:56:12] in the bride of jesus christ
[1:56:14] the fullness of the godhead bodily and
[1:56:17] every expression of god
[1:56:20] is in a people
[1:56:26] just like the culmination of the old
[1:56:29] testament brought the fullness in a body
[1:56:34] come on
[1:56:35] now god by his word has created another
[1:56:39] body
[1:56:40] called his bride it's the same god he
[1:56:42] just changed in his mouth
[1:56:44] and man it's now god in you
[1:56:48] christ in you
[1:56:50] that's the hope of glory
[1:56:52] are you with me church and now he comes
[1:56:55] to bring that same fullness into a
[1:56:58] people
[1:57:03] i'm driving it home now
[1:57:06] you see as brother branham said first
[1:57:08] he had to reveal himself in christ the
[1:57:10] fullness of the godhead bodily if you
[1:57:13] doubt that you ain't even got the first
[1:57:15] base yet
[1:57:17] if you questioned that you hadn't even
[1:57:19] you're not even
[1:57:20] you're not even playing yet
[1:57:23] amen you brother branham said you cannot
[1:57:26] get to first base without first
[1:57:29] believing in the supreme deity of the
[1:57:32] lord jesus christ
[1:57:35] first he had to reveal himself in christ
[1:57:37] the fullness of the godhead bodily and
[1:57:39] then to bring that fullness of the
[1:57:42] godhead bodily into a people that he
[1:57:46] could have the preeminency oversight
[1:57:47] deleting
[1:57:49] amen god expressed himself in jesus
[1:57:52] christ who was both father son and holy
[1:57:55] ghost the fullness of the goddest bodily
[1:57:57] now the complete fullness of the godhead
[1:58:00] bodily dwells in his church
[1:58:03] preeminence
[1:58:04] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:58:07] and all that christ was was poured into
[1:58:10] the church
[1:58:11] the believers
[1:58:13] and in there there would come forth it
[1:58:14] be a time
[1:58:16] when he could express himself
[1:58:19] in fullness of his godhead deity through
[1:58:22] his church
[1:58:23] have preeminence in his church oh my
[1:58:26] what the anointed man
[1:58:29] are you ready for this now
[1:58:32] now
[1:58:33] the anointed people
[1:58:37] to bring back the anointed bride and
[1:58:39] bridegroom
[1:58:41] so she's got to be the christ the
[1:58:43] messiah the anointed one just like he
[1:58:45] was
[1:58:47] amen and this is where every
[1:58:48] denomination passes off the scene
[1:58:52] this is where the shock is separated
[1:58:54] from the weak
[1:58:55] this is where the child of the bonds
[1:58:57] woman is rejected after coming of el
[1:58:59] shaddai
[1:59:01] by the announcing of the coming of a
[1:59:04] supernatural son of the promise
[1:59:07] i'm going to bring the seed of abraham
[1:59:10] and they're going to come supernaturally
[1:59:13] they will not come by denominational
[1:59:16] bondsman
[1:59:19] now
[1:59:20] this is where it changes
[1:59:23] from the days of the voice of the
[1:59:25] seventh angel and that phase
[1:59:27] is now
[1:59:28] over i i know that's shocking for
[1:59:31] somebody to hear that but that phase is
[1:59:33] complete
[1:59:35] he sounded his message
[1:59:37] he no longer preaching in shreveport and
[1:59:39] then in new mexico and bringing a new
[1:59:41] revelation here there it has been
[1:59:43] revealed
[1:59:44] the message has been finished
[1:59:48] there's no not in need to bring a
[1:59:50] another trail of the serpent and another
[1:59:52] idea or another this or another that or

[2:00:07] the thunders are revealed they're no
[2:00:09] longer a noise
[2:00:11] they're no longer just something that
[2:00:13] was said we don't understand we
[2:00:15] understand it now
[2:00:17] how do we know it by the because god
[2:00:20] descended from heaven with a shout and
[2:00:22] spoke a message through a prophet
[2:00:24] to do what to give us the full counsel
[2:00:28] of god every mystery of god needed for
[2:00:31] the bride has been delivered
[2:00:33] [Applause]
[2:00:35] i don't need to bring your new
[2:00:37] revelation i don't need to bring you a

[2:00:41] something that'll perfect you for the
[2:00:43] rapture it's already there
[2:00:45] it's already there
[2:00:47] what you need to do is take it for
[2:00:49] yourself and digest it and let it come
[2:00:52] out of your mouth and you speak the same
[2:00:54] thing the word said
[2:00:55] [Applause]
[2:01:01] revelation 10 8
[2:01:03] because too many people have stopped at
[2:01:05] revelation 10 7
[2:01:07] and the same angel continues
[2:01:10] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[2:01:11] speaking to me again
[2:01:13] saying go and take the little book that
[2:01:15] is open
[2:01:17] in the hand of the angel
[2:01:19] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[2:01:21] earth

[2:01:29] sister janie looked up there to see if
[2:01:30] that said that
[2:01:34] it
[2:01:34] don't but that's what people do
[2:01:38] they have claimed to take it
[2:01:40] and then they close off the power of god
[2:01:42] healing deliverance salvation miracles
[2:01:46] dear god we need miracles

[2:02:06] young people we see it in our middle age

[2:02:13] doesn't hold it has no bars
[2:02:16] are you with me the same word would go
[2:02:18] right down to bill dowell an old man
[2:02:20] past 90 and give him more years
[2:02:24] i'll tell you god is here to give you
[2:02:26] more years to make you live to the
[2:02:28] rapture
[2:02:30] it's the power that lays in the word

[2:02:35] tapped into is it's a thousand of water
[2:02:38] it's a is an unlimited fountain
[2:02:42] come on somebody help me preach it amen
[2:02:45] what have you got to do take that book
[2:02:47] and eat it
[2:02:49] and then prophesy
[2:02:51] let it come and live out of your life
[2:02:55] hallelujah let it manifest every promise
[2:03:00] why why eat it why eat the book
[2:03:04] verse 9 he said the angel said give he
[2:03:06] said to him give me the little book and
[2:03:08] he said take it and eat it up why eat it
[2:03:11] the word and the message must become
[2:03:14] flesh
[2:03:16] it's got to
[2:03:17] move from book form to flesh form
[2:03:23] and when eating and digesting
[2:03:26] then it must become a voice
[2:03:29] of god
[2:03:31] and i wanted to say and declare that
[2:03:34] voice is now in a bride
[2:03:36] amen
[2:03:39] revelation 10 11 and he said thou must
[2:03:41] prophesy again
[2:03:43] it's already been prophesied we saw it
[2:03:45] manifested in brother branham
[2:03:47] we saw what the word would do it healed
[2:03:49] the sick it raised the dead it cast out
[2:03:51] devils and when it filled with the holy
[2:03:53] ghost come on it brought truth and
[2:03:55] revelation and enlightenment it throwed
[2:03:57] light upon
[2:03:59] the word that had been once darkened
[2:04:01] from our view
[2:04:02] come on somebody else help me right now
[2:04:05] am i but now you must prophesy
[2:04:07] now it's your time to speak now it's
[2:04:10] your hour for the bride now to be
[2:04:13] manifested
[2:04:16] [Music]
[2:04:19] and it must produce
[2:04:22] a supernatural
[2:04:24] people
[2:04:25] so you wind up with abraham one of his
[2:04:29] flesh
[2:04:30] and one of the supernatural
[2:04:35] this is not complete
[2:04:37] until it's made flesh
[2:04:40] and it's not complete
[2:04:43] until it's all made manifest
[2:04:46] until the dead and christ are made flesh
[2:04:48] again
[2:04:49] and their theophanies are glorified
[2:04:53] amen you're thinking you know we got to
[2:04:55] be glorified so do they
[2:04:58] amen but i'm going to tell you friends
[2:04:59] that's exactly why you have become a
[2:05:03] voice
[2:05:05] amen that's exactly right brother adam
[2:05:07] told us and what is the holy ghost he
[2:05:08] said at that day you will know i'm in
[2:05:11] the father and you and me and i and you
[2:05:13] see as god poured himself in the church
[2:05:15] at that day the whole thing is one plan
[2:05:18] of redemption coming down god coming
[2:05:20] back to live in and dwell in and commune
[2:05:22] to his people as he did beginning and as
[2:05:25] soon as he gets his church in speaking
[2:05:29] condition
[2:05:31] gets love and persuade and fellowship
[2:05:34] uh
[2:05:35] his church to a place that he can flow
[2:05:38] himself through
[2:05:40] and love and persuade and fellowship
[2:05:42] then there will come an eden and he'll
[2:05:44] take his church back where it left him
[2:05:47] back to an eden again there where it
[2:05:49] fell that's where the first start of the
[2:05:52] fall and that's where it'll be taken
[2:05:54] right back with every clean slate of
[2:05:56] redemption bringing them straight back
[2:05:58] to that place
[2:06:00] again
[2:06:02] hallelujah
[2:06:03] again he says now this day we're living
[2:06:07] this age is beyond pentecost
[2:06:11] he's speaking of azusa street
[2:06:14] but now it's all coming forth
[2:06:17] it's all a coming forth of the holy
[2:06:19] spirit
[2:06:20] till the great church is being filled up
[2:06:24] and trump full hallelujah
[2:06:27] of the great powers of the almighty god
[2:06:31] until it's got to place unto the very
[2:06:33] works that jesus done has manifested
[2:06:36] itself right back in the church right
[2:06:37] now
[2:06:39] again he says and what is the holy ghost
[2:06:42] given for but we needed the spirit of
[2:06:44] god
[2:06:45] ray when we needed the spirit of god
[2:06:48] raises a standard and we need a standard
[2:06:50] raise
[2:06:53] when we see prophecy being fulfilled

[2:09:39] and you
[2:09:40] the church is waiting on me and you
[2:09:42] adoption time
[2:09:44] where god can pour into us his fullness
[2:09:47] his power
[2:09:49] his resurrection that when the church
[2:09:51] and christ come so close together
[2:09:56] till christ becomes visible
[2:09:59] among us and raises the dead and we go
[2:10:02] in the rapture
[2:10:03] these are exciting times
[2:10:06] amen these are exciting times he said
[2:10:09] there there's been a little breath of it
[2:10:11] and luther a little blow every wesley a
[2:10:13] deeper blow with the pentecost now the
[2:10:15] breath and the spirit has become the
[2:10:18] same and she's uniting together bringing
[2:10:20] forth that same powerful blow of the
[2:10:23] holy ghost like he did back there is
[2:10:25] manifesting the same works he did back
[2:10:28] there is manifested again the same thing
[2:10:32] he said what is the holy ghost now el
[2:10:35] shaddai
[2:10:36] is the almighty god he is actually this
[2:10:39] is actually the baptism of the holy
[2:10:42] ghost
[2:10:47] that's exactly the place that we're in
[2:10:49] where god is pouring out in the people
[2:10:52] his fullness the fullness of his spirit
[2:10:55] and with the fullness of his spirit
[2:10:56] comes the fullness of his power
[2:10:59] they've had portions of it depths of the
[2:11:02] spirit and the ages past
[2:11:04] a dip in
[2:11:05] at luther a greater dip with wesley a
[2:11:09] greater depth with azusa street but this
[2:11:11] is where he pours out his fullness
[2:11:15] this is where el shaddai is known in his
[2:11:18] power in his fullness
[2:11:21] what's what he says he said to bring a
[2:11:24] church to a place in this day far beyond
[2:11:28] luther methodist pentecost into a place
[2:11:30] of adoption and rapture and grace
[2:11:33] that when this church when the spirit
[2:11:35] moves into this church here it'll just
[2:11:37] raise and it'll bring forth all that is
[2:11:40] redeemed that's touched by that spirit
[2:11:43] the lutherans who stood in the light
[2:11:45] they had in justification those
[2:11:46] methodists that fell on the floor and
[2:11:48] they throwed water in their face
[2:11:50] from the spirit striking them through
[2:11:52] sanctification those pentecostals that
[2:11:55] they walked up and down the streets and
[2:11:57] they called them tongues demon
[2:12:00] and jabbers and goose language and all
[2:12:02] that they'll stand in the righteousness
[2:12:04] in the sight of god in that day just as
[2:12:07] certain as the bible stands here but if

[2:18:56] of them pentecostals
[2:18:57] charismatic
[2:18:59] but it takes a supernatural
[2:19:01] to birth a bride for christ
[2:19:04] and only el shaddai can do that
[2:19:08] only
[2:19:09] only a true baptism of the holy ghost
[2:19:12] will produce a bride
[2:19:15] because sarah was 90
[2:19:17] and abraham was 99
[2:19:20] god would have to restore their bodies
[2:19:24] and heal sarah of her barrenness
[2:19:28] amen he would portray in their lives he
[2:19:31] would actually use them to prophesy
[2:19:34] of all the seed of abraham that would
[2:19:36] come
[2:19:37] remember why does he go up on the top of
[2:19:40] the mount
[2:19:42] how come that he goes and is offered as
[2:19:44] a sacrifice
[2:19:46] and god provides the lamb
[2:19:48] because it is a prophecy of the seed
[2:19:52] coming
[2:19:53] so what we are reading in the bible here
[2:19:56] is a portrayal it is a prophecy
[2:20:00] that and god used in their lives as a
[2:20:02] prophecy what he would do at the end age
[2:20:07] amen for he will change the bodies of
[2:20:09] the living church
[2:20:11] and resurrect the dead in christ
[2:20:14] in order to bring of the to about the
[2:20:18] long-awaited promised son jesus christ
[2:20:23] now god promised that the grain of wheat
[2:20:26] that he planted at pentecost
[2:20:28] in the book of acts would return back to
[2:20:30] the grain again
[2:20:32] and these other stages of the wheat
[2:20:35] plant
[2:20:36] like the blade the tonsil the shack
[2:20:39] they were not the promised restoration
[2:20:42] no more than ishmael
[2:20:44] was not the promised son
[2:20:47] and neither was azusa street the
[2:20:49] restoration to pentecost
[2:20:52] they are called pentecost like ishmael
[2:20:54] was called abraham's seed but he was he
[2:20:57] was not the prophecy
[2:21:00] they are called the pentecost but
[2:21:02] they're not the promised pentecost
[2:21:05] is somebody with me amen but let me tell
[2:21:08] you this is the restoration
[2:21:11] god will take his church right back
[2:21:15] to the pentecost of the beginning
[2:21:19] hallelujah we remember you know it's the
[2:21:21] vine putting forth her branch and again
[2:21:24] there's been all kinds granted on
[2:21:26] and through i uh sarah's idea ishmael is
[2:21:30] is grafted through a bonds woman into
[2:21:33] the family but she's not part of he's
[2:21:35] not a part of the promise of god
[2:21:38] somebody with me we've got baptist
[2:21:40] methodist
[2:21:42] lutheran everything else you know that's
[2:21:44] been grafted into it every kind of
[2:21:46] denominational fruit but if she ever
[2:21:49] puts forth another branch
[2:21:53] are you with me now
[2:21:55] listen they have tried to reform the
[2:21:57] tree by trying to put in this luther or
[2:22:01] wesley or that it's all reformation
[2:22:04] but if the vine from the root
[2:22:07] ever puts forth another branch
[2:22:09] amen she'll be a genuine christ centered
[2:22:13] amen christ feel the word of god
[2:22:17] i'm quoting your prophet there she'll be
[2:22:19] a genuine christ feel christ-centered
[2:22:22] word of god if it ever puts forth
[2:22:25] another breath she'll be the word like
[2:22:29] he was the word
[2:22:32] amen as he said i will restore saint the
[2:22:35] lord i'll send back another church in
[2:22:37] the last day i'll restore the original
[2:22:40] power again
[2:22:42] in the evening time it shall be light
[2:22:45] down in the heart of the tree no matter
[2:22:46] how many branches is pruned there will
[2:22:49] come forth the royal seed of abraham
[2:22:53] hallelujah god promised city i god will
[2:22:56] do it i will restore remember that
[2:23:00] now he said it's for ishmael
[2:23:02] i bless him there's 40 000 of them they
[2:23:05] are a great nation
[2:23:06] there'll be some of them
[2:23:08] that will there and and and i'm not even
[2:23:11] saying you know any of the of the great
[2:23:14] horse system but there be sincere people
[2:23:16] among them that will be there out to the
[2:23:19] in the tribulation and they have would
[2:23:21] have washed their robes in the blood of
[2:23:23] the lamb and they'll be led to living
[2:23:25] waters of the great white throne
[2:23:27] judgment
[2:23:28] the living waters that they missed here
[2:23:30] they'll get there and they'll have
[2:23:32] eternal life
[2:23:34] amen but but let me tell you they may be
[2:23:36] called abraham seed but god makes a

[2:54:45] has done some great works in her life in
[2:54:48] the long life's journey
[2:54:50] you know sometimes we make some missteps
[2:54:52] along the way and we don't
[2:54:54] maybe haven't ever went as far along
[2:54:56] with god as we should
[2:54:59] but seed of abraham sometimes can go
[2:55:01] down to egypt
[2:55:03] but god won't leave them there
[2:55:06] every seed of god he'll get back in the
[2:55:08] promised land is only back in the
[2:55:10] promised land
[2:55:11] where god will bless you
[2:55:13] and i believe that god is meeting sister
[2:55:16] sherry in this water today
[2:55:20] she has come as jesus did obedient to
[2:55:22] the word of god
[2:55:24] jesus came obeying the word brought his
[2:55:26] body his flesh down to the river jordan
[2:55:29] to be baptized
[2:55:30] submit himself to be filled with the

[2:55:40] back where the blessings flow
[2:55:42] back where she can meet with el shaddai
[2:55:45] back with it that god can put his life
[2:55:48] into her
[2:55:49] so sister sherry as i have prayed with
[2:55:52] you
[2:55:53] there already
[2:55:54] and you have come to be baptized in the
[2:55:57] name of jesus christ and obey his word
[2:56:02] the lord jesus sent me to preach the
[2:56:04] gospel
[2:56:05] into all the world
[2:56:08] and he commissioned me to baptize those
[2:56:10] that believed and received him to
[2:56:13] baptize them
[2:56:15] in the name of the father and of the son
[2:56:17] and of the holy ghost
[2:56:19] and so in the obedience to that divine
[2:56:22] promise of god
[2:56:24] i baptize you
[2:56:26] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:56:31] praise the lord
[2:56:32] thank you lord

[2:56:38] and thank you thank you lord thank you

[2:56:58] amen amen god bless you
[2:57:01] amen for being obedient to the word amen
[2:57:05] god bless you
[2:57:13] praise the lord
[2:57:15] isn't god good to give us so many
[2:57:17] blessings
[2:57:18] give me romans chapter six i want to
[2:57:20] read from verse 1
[2:57:22] there this
[2:57:23] this morning as we just
[2:57:25] think of the word of god and his
[2:57:26] promises
[2:57:29] the bible said what shall we say then
[2:57:31] shall we continue in sin that grace may
[2:57:34] abound
[2:57:35] god forbid so for how so we that are
[2:57:38] dead to sin live any longer therein
[2:57:42] know ye not that so many of us as were
[2:57:44] baptized into jesus christ were baptized
[2:57:47] into his death
[2:57:50] therefore we we are buried with him by
[2:57:53] baptism into death that like his christ
[2:57:56] was raised up from the dead by the glory
[2:57:58] of the father
[2:58:01] even so we also should walk in the
[2:58:04] newness of life
[2:58:08] but if we have been planted together in
[2:58:10] the likeness of his death we shall also
[2:58:13] be in the likeness of his resurrection
[2:58:16] so what we are here doing today is we
[2:58:18] are absolutely
[2:58:21] typing out the death the burial the
[2:58:23] resurrection
[2:58:25] of the lord jesus
[2:58:27] and as i've explained to these young men
[2:58:29] and this is ethan adams coming here that
[2:58:33] wants to be baptized in the name of the
[2:58:36] lord jesus
[2:58:38] you know it's not it's not about our
[2:58:39] young people coming to maturity or to
[2:58:42] puberty and they you know so now they're
[2:58:43] going to do the adult things this is not
[2:58:45] about doing adult things
[2:58:47] this is about doing the right things
[2:58:50] following the lord in water baptism
[2:58:53] and the water baptism there that we have
[2:58:56] been instructed in
[2:58:58] is at first
[2:58:59] the first steps of salvation is
[2:59:01] repentance and that's turning from sin
[2:59:04] and then and of course there has to be a
[2:59:07] death
[2:59:08] to the old man and that's the problem is
[2:59:11] we bury too many lied people we are only
[2:59:14] to bury the dead
[2:59:16] and so we can bury those and they will
[2:59:19] go down in the water
[2:59:21] you know as a live person come back
[2:59:23] alive but if you are ever dead to your
[2:59:25] sins
[2:59:26] you will come up in the newness of life
[2:59:29] and be filled with the holy ghost
[2:59:31] this is a promise is to us to our
[2:59:33] children to them that are far off as
[2:59:36] many as the lord our god shall call
[2:59:38] now ethan
[2:59:39] the lord jesus sent me to preach the
[2:59:42] gospel he commissioned me to do it
[2:59:45] and i come
[2:59:47] as his forerunner today in the sense
[2:59:50] that i'm the baptizer
[2:59:53] but there's one coming after me that
[2:59:56] will do what i cannot do
[2:59:58] he will baptize you with the holy ghost
[3:00:00] and fire
[3:00:02] so today you being dead to sin and you
[3:00:04] repented of your sin that's correct
[3:00:07] and you've asked the lord to be the lord
[3:00:09] of your life correct
[3:00:11] now then on the confession of your faith
[3:00:14] where he sent me into the world and he
[3:00:16] gave me a commission
[3:00:18] the great commission go into all the
[3:00:20] world and preach the gospel
[3:00:22] baptizing them in the name of the father
[3:00:26] and of the son and of the holy ghost in
[3:00:28] obedience to that divine command i
[3:00:31] baptize you brother ethan in the name of
[3:00:34] the lord jesus christ
[3:00:49] thank you lord
[3:01:02] praise the lord
[3:01:15] comes one of our young men that i prayed
[3:01:17] for many times
[3:01:20] toby

[3:01:26] day
[3:01:27] on wednesday night
