[48:10] once again and just coming out of the
[48:12] youth camp there in oklahoma and had
[48:13] another a wonderful time together in the
[48:16] presence of the lord and
[48:17] brother andrew spencer myself minister
[48:19] in there and the lord sure used brother
[48:21] andrew in a special way and
[48:23] to minister to many needs and we just
[48:25] thank the lord for the bride's revival
[48:27] amen and we sure appreciate brother tim
[48:29] and his confidence to stand here tonight
[48:31] and to minister to you and brother
[48:33] timothy and the church here and all the
[48:34] ministers we say god bless them and want
[48:36] to greet you for brother sean martin and
[48:38] the church at home sean said to be sure
[48:39] and tell everybody hello for him so we
[48:41] want to do that this evening and i'm
[48:43] glad to have my wife here with me this
[48:45] evening and
[48:46] we're as i've most of you probably heard
[48:48] but she's expecting our first baby we'll
[48:50] be doing august so we're very excited
[48:52] about that and looking forward to that
[48:54] so amen lord willing there'll be three
[48:57] glovers next time amen
[48:59] so amen god bless you this evening the
[49:00] book of john the sixth chapter
[49:03] i want to look in the 66th verse i know
[49:04] it's a very familiar reading to you in
[49:06] john 6
[49:08] and verse 66
[49:09] the bible here says
[49:11] from that time
[49:12] many of his disciples went back
[49:15] and walked no more with him
[49:18] i don't find myself in that category
[49:20] then said jesus unto the twelve
[49:23] will ye also go away
[49:25] but then simon peter answered him
[49:28] lord
[49:29] to whom shall we go
[49:31] for thou hast the words
[49:33] of eternal life
[49:35] and i love the next words here and we
[49:38] believe and are sure
[49:40] there is no guessing there is no
[49:42] possibility
[49:43] we believe and are sure
[49:45] that thou art that christ the son of the
[49:48] living god
[49:49] and jesus answered them have not i
[49:51] chosen you twelve and one of you is a
[49:54] devil he spake of judas iscariot of the
[49:57] son of simon
[49:58] for it was he that should betray him
[50:01] being one of the twelve amen we ask the
[50:03] lord this evening to add the blessing to
[50:05] the reading of his word as you can be
[50:07] seated here this afternoon
[50:09] from those passages of scripture i'd
[50:11] like to by the help of the lord to
[50:13] minister to you tonight for just a few
[50:14] moments here if i would title this
[50:16] thought tonight i want to speak to you
[50:18] on we are held by a true experience we
[50:21] are held by a true experience how many
[50:24] believers do we have here tonight
[50:25] they're real christians real holy
[50:27] ghost-filled believers we are held by a
[50:30] true experience and i know that you know
[50:32] these uh thoughts very well but the
[50:34] prophet of god tells us that there's
[50:35] actually uh two types of christianity he
[50:38] says one is an intellectual or a mental
[50:40] conception he said but the other is an
[50:42] experimental experience now both uh exp
[50:46] both types of christianity will only
[50:48] hold a certain class of people and i
[50:50] don't believe tonight that we are
[50:52] intellectual or mental christians i
[50:54] believe we are the ones that are
[50:55] experimental experienced christians when
[50:58] we sing we know what we're singing about
[51:00] when we pray we know who we're praying
[51:02] to when we preach we know what we're
[51:03] preaching about we know who we are
[51:05] tonight by the word now we find this
[51:07] land a foundation that an experimental
[51:09] experience uh actually comes by having
[51:12] an experience with the person of the
[51:14] word not just holding the bible or being
[51:16] around the message but actually having
[51:18] contact with the person of the word in
[51:20] the book of john the first chapter the
[51:21] first verse it says in the beginning was
[51:24] the word and the word was with god and
[51:26] the word was god and the same was in the
[51:29] beginning with god all things were made
[51:31] by him and without him was not anything
[51:33] made that was made now if you skip down
[51:35] to the 14th verse it says and the word
[51:38] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[51:40] beheld his glory the glory as of the
[51:42] only begotten of the father full of
[51:45] grace and truth in that in that
[51:46] beautiful amen full of grace and truth
[51:48] now the prophet of god says it this way
[51:50] he says the true word comes to the true
[51:52] prophet how many will agree we're
[51:54] following a true prophet who brought the
[51:56] true word the true word comes to the
[51:58] true prophet and he tells you the true
[52:00] word and you follow that true word and
[52:02] you get a true experience
[52:04] of the word if you follow the true word
[52:06] you're going to get a true experience of
[52:08] the word because the word is made flesh
[52:10] in you and you become god's son and the
[52:13] word of god is revolving right out of
[52:15] you because you are of his nature his
[52:18] spirit is in you and the works of god
[52:20] you will do let me let me read that
[52:22] again if you follow that true word then
[52:24] you will get a true experience of the
[52:26] word because the word will be made flesh
[52:28] in you you will become god's son and the
[52:31] word of god is revolving right out of
[52:33] you of god into you because you are of
[52:35] his nature his spirit is in you and
[52:38] you'll do the works of god i don't
[52:40] believe that's just limited to a
[52:41] preacher i don't believe that's just
[52:43] limited amen to the prophet but i
[52:45] believe every true believer who is
[52:47] following the true word amen has a right
[52:50] to receive a true experience of that
[52:52] true word now you know as well as i know
[52:54] that we're not following any kind of
[52:55] message amen but we're following a
[52:57] restoration message which means amen
[53:00] that god has restored all the loose sins
[53:02] to the church whatever has been lost
[53:04] amen through denominationalism through
[53:06] organizations through the dark ages
[53:08] whatever was lost to the church has now
[53:11] been restored to the church and i'll say
[53:13] it like this amen i believe the message
[53:16] restored the true doctrine to the church
[53:18] i believe it restored how we should
[53:19] baptize and how we should conduct
[53:21] services and how we should rest and amen
[53:24] the truth of predestination i believe
[53:25] the word amen has restored all those
[53:27] doctrines to the church but at the same
[53:29] time amen i believe the word has
[53:32] restored a true experience to the church
[53:34] amen i know many people when you start
[53:36] talking about experience the first quote
[53:37] they go to is where the prophet of god
[53:39] set away with experience and i'll agree
[53:42] he said that amen but he said away with
[53:44] experience as the plumb line of the
[53:46] church and back to the word amen but if
[53:48] you're following the word then you're
[53:49] going to have an experience with the
[53:51] word and the word experience is what's
[53:53] going to keep you amen you realize that
[53:55] there's nobody in the bible that
[53:57] overcame but what had an experience
[53:59] apostle paul the prophet said he knew he
[54:01] had an experience he said here is
[54:02] another good lesson for us that
[54:04] experience alone isn't enough it's got
[54:06] to be experienced according to the word
[54:09] of the lord so you see him this knowing
[54:11] that it was a great something then
[54:12] somebody else had received it before him
[54:14] he took three years and six months down
[54:16] in the desert in arabia taking the bible
[54:18] as it was then the old testament he said
[54:21] and going down there to compare this
[54:23] experience that he had to see if it was
[54:25] scriptural so paul was not just looking
[54:27] for any kind of experience he was
[54:28] looking for a word experience but he was
[54:31] wanting something that matched the bible
[54:33] he said what if he said well i guess
[54:34] that was just a little blow over and
[54:35] went on i'm going to follow my intellect
[54:37] now he had to become a prisoner to
[54:39] something he'd become a prisoner so
[54:41] after comparing it and seeing no wonder
[54:44] he could write the book of hebrews in a
[54:46] type three years and half down there
[54:48] laying in the word and finding out very
[54:51] god that called him was talking him back
[54:53] amen think about this the very god that
[54:55] called him was taken him back and was
[54:58] changing all of his intellects changing
[55:00] all that he ever thought all that he had
[55:01] trained to be all of his ambitions just
[55:03] wiped it away from him and he became a
[55:06] prisoner the love of god had been so
[55:09] tremendous and such a revelation that he
[55:12] could not get away from it now there is
[55:14] a true experience amen is when something
[55:16] comes into your life amen that no matter
[55:19] what you go through no matter what you
[55:20] face no matter what situation arises
[55:23] amen it will never get away from you
[55:25] amen amen you may get away from it but
[55:28] it'll never get away from you he said
[55:30] that's the true experience of a real
[55:32] believer who meets god you come in
[55:34] contact with something that's so great
[55:36] that you become a prisoner to everything
[55:38] else you get away from everything to
[55:40] imprison yourself to this now amen i
[55:42] know that we're living in a day and time
[55:44] when there's such a falling away the
[55:46] prophet of god would say this way we
[55:47] find today that there's such a fallen
[55:49] away it seems to be that people are not
[55:51] interested like they used to be he said
[55:53] they're falling away from the
[55:55] fundamental facts of the bible he said
[55:57] they seem to be drifting into the sad
[55:59] thing that we're living in a day and
[56:00] time when we're this close to the
[56:01] rapture amen and people are throwing in
[56:03] the towel and giving up isn't it a sad
[56:06] time when we're this close to ain't been
[56:07] to the future home and the millennium of
[56:09] the church amen that people are growing
[56:11] weary and they're walking away and
[56:12] there's a question that always comes up
[56:14] when you hear that somebody is left is
[56:16] why did they leave how could they do
[56:18] that amen can i give you the answer it's
[56:20] because they never had a true word
[56:22] experience amen amen if you get a true
[56:25] word experience and a believer amen the
[56:27] red sea can't take it out of them even
[56:29] the lines then can't take it out ever
[56:31] amen amen the walls of jericho can't
[56:33] take it out of listen friends we are not
[56:35] here amen it's just a bunch of worked up
[56:37] emotional people amen we are here as
[56:39] real believers who have who have met god
[56:42] on the sacred sands we we have met more
[56:44] than a picture we have met more than
[56:46] amen a youth camp experience we have met
[56:48] the person of the word and he has
[56:49] quickened something in our hearts amen
[56:51] i'll sit like this you can live in
[56:53] church amen and there's many people
[56:55] living in church today that still don't
[56:56] have an experience the prophet said such
[56:59] a penny today to see men and women who
[57:01] have lived in church and been brought up
[57:02] in this cradle amen and knows the bible
[57:05] well but has never experienced amen or
[57:08] witnessed an experience with god what we
[57:10] need is to get back to real heartfelt
[57:12] experience amen to know who you've got
[57:15] faith in amen not in some writing but
[57:17] the true and living god amen who lives
[57:20] now amen let me ask you amen where did
[57:23] your experience place your faith did you
[57:25] experience place your faith in the
[57:26] pastor did you experience place your
[57:29] faith in the church did your experience
[57:31] place your faith in a prophet alone amen
[57:33] if it's a real word experience amen it
[57:35] will place your faith back in the word
[57:37] and the word says heaven earth will pass
[57:39] away amen but my word shall never pass
[57:42] away well we might as well go ahead and
[57:43] tell the devil there are some believers
[57:45] on the earth tonight amen who can no
[57:47] more die than god can die amen because
[57:50] they receive more than a feeling they
[57:52] have received more than an emotion they
[57:54] have received more than a religious
[57:55] education they have received a witness
[57:58] on the inside of their souls by the
[58:00] baptism of the holy ghost amen therefore
[58:02] tonight we're not following a bunch of
[58:04] intellectuals we are following a bible
[58:06] experience amen can i can i lay a few
[58:08] quotes here to lay a foundation he said
[58:10] what we need today is a good old time
[58:12] saint paul's revival and the bible holy
[58:14] goes back in the church again amen
[58:16] there's so much of this wishy washy
[58:18] carrying on in the name of christianity
[58:20] taken away he said here it is as
[58:22] crippled as the church is education's
[58:24] not your crutch your faith is your
[58:26] crutch that's right education will never
[58:29] do it denomination will never do it
[58:31] there'll never be an organization ever
[58:33] substitute amen the upper room
[58:35] experience amen there'll never be a
[58:37] school take the place of pentecost it
[58:40] cannot be not by power not by might but
[58:43] by my spirit saith the lord that's what
[58:45] we need today is back to the bible
[58:47] experience amen christians that are born
[58:49] again that are washing the blood of god
[58:52] made white regenerated twice what the
[58:54] world needs today is a revival an
[58:56] old-time revival the kind that saint
[58:58] paul had in about 80 66 amen then we
[59:02] don't need a revival of emotion we don't
[59:04] need a revival of a sensation we need a
[59:07] word revival now amen i'm this close to
[59:09] the devil so i might as well cut his
[59:10] head off amen when people hear you say
[59:12] that they say well then let's have a
[59:14] revival without emotion amen but how can
[59:16] god come in the midst of a bunch of
[59:18] people that has been born again by the
[59:20] blood that has been filled by the power
[59:21] of god and there not be some kind of
[59:23] reaction to an action listen friends i
[59:25] hope you'll understand when you see
[59:27] somebody that's really had a word
[59:29] experience when the songs begin to be
[59:31] sung and they begin to stand up and
[59:33] express themselves they're not doing
[59:34] that because it's an emotion they're
[59:36] doing that because the person who
[59:38] they're singing about they have met and
[59:40] then the person when the word is being
[59:42] preached and something moves over to
[59:44] stand up and say amen they're not doing
[59:46] that to get attention they're not doing
[59:48] that to be emotional they're doing that
[59:50] they've been because there's something
[59:51] inside of them amen that is connected
[59:53] with the word they're here what are you
[59:55] saying i'm saying like this the prophet
[59:57] said amen that there were mysteries that
[59:59] were laying in this bible that would be
[1:00:01] to reveal but they have been hid since
[1:00:02] before the foundation of the world then
[1:00:05] do you realize what was on the inside of
[1:00:06] you there was a gene seed of god laying
[1:00:09] there from before the foundation of the
[1:00:11] world listen friends if anybody's got a
[1:00:13] righteous child it's the bride of jesus
[1:00:15] christ
[1:00:17] you say why we gotta write a shout i'll
[1:00:19] tell you why amen because the mysteries
[1:00:21] that have been hid since before the
[1:00:23] foundation of the world amen have found
[1:00:26] a soul that was predestinated from
[1:00:28] before the foundation of the world to
[1:00:30] believe what has been hidden from before
[1:00:32] the foundational world listen friends
[1:00:34] may i say it like this you are the place
[1:00:36] that eternity has met again even the
[1:00:39] eternal word has made an eternal seed
[1:00:42] and there ain't no stopping it now there
[1:00:44] ain't no turning around now there ain't
[1:00:46] no giving up now there ain't no backing
[1:00:48] off the message now come on we're not
[1:00:50] come here ain't meant to come up against
[1:00:52] some little devil back up we are not a
[1:00:54] bunch of denominational christians we
[1:00:56] are perseverant they've been pursuing
[1:00:58] christians we have got to go and the
[1:01:00] grave is not our goal the sky is our
[1:01:03] goal amen hell is not our destination
[1:01:05] eternity is our destination that we are
[1:01:08] not persevered by a feeling we're not
[1:01:10] persevering by service we're persevering
[1:01:13] by a true word by a true prophet in the
[1:01:15] age we're living and listen friends it's
[1:01:17] time to take inventory of your
[1:01:18] experience now i'm just going to lay
[1:01:20] some word here for a second amen because
[1:01:22] if your experience only holds from one
[1:01:24] youth camp to another amen something's
[1:01:25] going to take you out if your experience
[1:01:28] only holds as long as the pastor's in
[1:01:29] town something's going to take you out
[1:01:31] but if your experience goes beyond the
[1:01:33] surface of the flesh and goes beyond the
[1:01:35] surface of the spear and that experience
[1:01:38] is in your soul amen you might as well
[1:01:40] tell hell to get used to me until i'm
[1:01:42] translated because i'm going to be here
[1:01:44] i'm not backing up i'm not turning
[1:01:46] around i'm not going nowhere there is a
[1:01:49] connection that has come from an unseen
[1:01:51] dimension into the depths of my soul
[1:01:54] it's the invisible union of the heavenly
[1:01:56] bridegroom and the earthly bride listen
[1:01:58] friends we can't turn around we came
[1:02:00] back up now it's our season to persevere
[1:02:03] it's our hour to pursue it's our hour to
[1:02:06] overcome it's our age to believe him
[1:02:08] we're not following any kind of word we
[1:02:11] are following a true word
[1:02:14] that has produced a true experience he
[1:02:16] said oh what we need today amen in this
[1:02:18] country when gross darkness thank you
[1:02:20] this country when gross darkness is
[1:02:22] covering the world he said why is that
[1:02:23] happening because they have rejected the
[1:02:25] gospel he said each one of us should
[1:02:27] take inventory of our own experience in
[1:02:30] our own standings with god and see how
[1:02:32] we stand in his sight paul says it this
[1:02:34] way therefore by the deeds of the law
[1:02:36] there shall no flesh be justified in his
[1:02:38] sight for by the law is the knowledge of
[1:02:41] sin paul would say in colossians 1 21
[1:02:43] and you that were sometimes alienating
[1:02:45] enemies in your mind by wicked works yet
[1:02:47] now somebody shout now yet now hath he
[1:02:50] reconciled in the body of his flesh
[1:02:53] through death to present you holy and
[1:02:55] inflammable and unreprovable in his
[1:02:57] sight paul would say in hebrews 13 21
[1:03:00] that he would make you perfect in every
[1:03:01] good work amen to do his will working in
[1:03:04] you that which is well pleasing in his
[1:03:06] sight through jesus christ to whom be
[1:03:08] glory for ever and ever amen i love this
[1:03:11] one whatsoever we ask we receive of him
[1:03:14] first john 3 22 whatsoever we ask we
[1:03:17] receive of him because we keep his
[1:03:20] commandments and do the things that are
[1:03:22] pleasing in his side amen now i'm just
[1:03:24] glad to preach a little bit if that's
[1:03:25] okay amen the bible says you got to have
[1:03:27] an experience now there's there's an
[1:03:29] all-out attack against people who
[1:03:31] actually believe in a holy ghost
[1:03:32] experience but the bible says amen the
[1:03:35] reason why they're seeing the things
[1:03:36] they're seeing is because they're doing
[1:03:38] the things god requires to be done if
[1:03:41] you're killing the move of god and
[1:03:42] killing the atmosphere the holy ghost
[1:03:44] amen don't get mad at somebody to give
[1:03:46] the holy ghost to right away amen
[1:03:48] because this is the season for the holy
[1:03:50] ghost to come in the church listen we've
[1:03:52] had enough men performers on the pulpit
[1:03:54] we've had enough preachers personalities
[1:03:56] it's time to let the holy ghost come in
[1:03:58] the church and the holy ghost said if
[1:04:01] you'll preach the word he'll follow the
[1:04:02] word and if you follow the true word
[1:04:04] you'll get a true experience come on
[1:04:06] friends we're not worked up we're
[1:04:08] following a true word that is releasing
[1:04:10] a true experience upon us i love that
[1:04:12] word experience it means a practical
[1:04:14] contact or observation with facts or
[1:04:17] events it is an event or an occurrence
[1:04:19] amen that leaves an impression on
[1:04:21] someone it is an encounter or to undergo
[1:04:24] an event in other words an experience
[1:04:27] happens when contact is made without
[1:04:29] contact there'll be no experience
[1:04:31] without contact there'll be no change
[1:04:33] without contact there'll be nothing put
[1:04:35] inside of you and it'll cause you to
[1:04:37] hold out but if contact is made even an
[1:04:40] experience will take place what happens
[1:04:42] is an experience leaves an impression
[1:04:45] have you ever seen something and you
[1:04:46] said i'll never forget that have you
[1:04:48] ever been somewhere and seen something
[1:04:50] and you said i'll never forget that do
[1:04:52] you know why you said that it's because
[1:04:53] there was something there that impressed
[1:04:55] you you underwent a feeling or something
[1:04:58] that impressed you to cause you to never
[1:05:00] forget that and the prophecy this way he
[1:05:03] said tonight we're going to read some of
[1:05:04] god's word and be ready for this event
[1:05:07] of his presence again amen to bring us
[1:05:09] his word see then the presence of god
[1:05:12] amen brings a change when you've got the
[1:05:14] true word of god amen is this okay he
[1:05:17] said if a man is sin of god he'll stay
[1:05:19] with the word because god can only be
[1:05:21] sent by his word he must stay by his
[1:05:24] word then when we come into his presence
[1:05:26] when a man once comes in the presence of
[1:05:28] god he is changed forever if there's any
[1:05:32] changing to him when a man once comes in
[1:05:35] the presence of god he's changed forever
[1:05:37] if there's any change unto him want to
[1:05:39] go the bible let's go there was a man
[1:05:41] named moses who came in the presence of
[1:05:43] god and he went from being a runaway
[1:05:45] prophet to being the mighty deliverer of
[1:05:47] the seed of god there was a man named
[1:05:49] jacob who was running from his father
[1:05:51] amen but he met an angel and he
[1:05:53] underwent an encounter with the angel
[1:05:55] and something happened to him amen that
[1:05:57] when he got up he didn't walk the same
[1:05:59] he didn't talk the same now there are
[1:06:01] those who can walk in the presence of
[1:06:02] god and pay no attention it's because
[1:06:04] they're not ordained alive but if he was
[1:06:06] predestined of god as soon as it first
[1:06:09] hits he knows it then it catches fire
[1:06:12] listen young people what god has done
[1:06:14] for you has not come from an emotion it
[1:06:16] has not come from a sensation it has not
[1:06:18] come from some man's idea what god has
[1:06:21] done for you has come from his word and
[1:06:23] there's a fire inside of you i'm on
[1:06:24] church i know the bible says there's an
[1:06:26] unquenchable fire in hell amen but let's
[1:06:28] not leave that on the negative side amen
[1:06:30] let's bring it to the positive if
[1:06:32] there's an unquenchable fire in hell
[1:06:34] then there's an unquenchable fire in
[1:06:35] this church and it's not coming from a
[1:06:37] man it's not coming from the system it's
[1:06:40] coming from the word listen i'll tell
[1:06:41] you what if you'll preach this message
[1:06:43] the holy ghost will come down and he'll
[1:06:45] set somebody on fire and people will
[1:06:48] show up just to watch the church burn i
[1:06:50] say what we need is to let the holy
[1:06:51] ghost amen set our preachers on power
[1:06:54] let the holy ghost set our singers on
[1:06:56] power let the holy ghost set our
[1:06:58] musicians on time let the holy ghost set
[1:07:00] the church on time it's been a long time
[1:07:03] amen since some of you have felt any
[1:07:05] power hey remember let me just tell you
[1:07:06] the fire hadn't gone out it's still
[1:07:09] burning as hot as it ever did what
[1:07:11] happened was you got a little bit cold
[1:07:12] and let the devil picture fire but
[1:07:14] there's some believers here tonight who
[1:07:16] has been lit by an unquenchable fire
[1:07:19] it's the pillar of power and it'll take
[1:07:21] him to every trouble it'll take him to
[1:07:23] every danger through many dangerous
[1:07:24] calls and stairs we have already come by
[1:07:28] the grace of god
[1:07:29] are you hearing me tonight i don't know
[1:07:31] where the glasses went but that's okay
[1:07:33] are you hearing me tonight it's an
[1:07:34] unquenchable fire amen your feelings
[1:07:36] can't put it out amen that's what i'm
[1:07:38] talking about they met an unquenchable
[1:07:40] fire you can bring it into cold service
[1:07:42] when there's all kinds of pressures and
[1:07:44] all kinds of weird feelings and just let
[1:07:46] the holy ghost get to pulsate and before
[1:07:48] long somebody will break out and say
[1:07:50] amen and somebody else will raise their
[1:07:52] hand and somebody else will begin to
[1:07:53] worship what is it it's an unquenchable
[1:07:55] power that has come from a true word
[1:07:57] experience that has released you to
[1:07:59] worship god regardless of the condition
[1:08:02] when you have had a true experience you
[1:08:04] will live a different life the product
[1:08:06] of god said you could say well this
[1:08:08] changed me brother aunt brother branham
[1:08:09] he said look when he comes in his
[1:08:11] presence we're changed never to be the
[1:08:14] same again you look all down to the ages
[1:08:17] and you'll see when a man come in the
[1:08:18] presence of god he was changed forever
[1:08:21] look at abraham he was chained forever
[1:08:23] well brother branham this is just for
[1:08:25] the ministers oh no the change to life
[1:08:28] is for everybody
[1:08:30] come on help me preach it i the change
[1:08:32] life is for everybody to change life is
[1:08:35] not just for the preacher but change
[1:08:37] life is not just for the pastor the
[1:08:39] change life is for everybody amen
[1:08:41] everybody under the sound of this
[1:08:43] message can live a changed life then
[1:08:45] what is the power ain't meant to bring a
[1:08:47] change the prophet said when a man comes
[1:08:49] in contact with god his maker it changes
[1:08:52] the whole attitude it changes his mental
[1:08:55] it changes his habit it changes his body
[1:08:58] it changes his nature it changes
[1:09:00] everything
[1:09:02] then when the word changes that man it
[1:09:05] releases something in him what i will
[1:09:07] call an enduring experience the bible
[1:09:09] says in hebrews 11 amen that by faith he
[1:09:12] which was moses amen for sick egypt not
[1:09:15] fearing the wrath of the king for he
[1:09:17] endured as seeing him who is invisible
[1:09:20] you know what that word endured means it
[1:09:21] means to be steadfast so whatever
[1:09:24] happened to moses in the presence of god
[1:09:26] whatever happened to abraham in the
[1:09:28] presence of god whatever happened amen
[1:09:31] to to paul in the presence of god it
[1:09:33] released the stability it released the
[1:09:36] steadfastness now i know there's people
[1:09:37] say well people are in the spirit and
[1:09:39] there's never no change why do we always
[1:09:41] look at the negative amen i know there's
[1:09:43] been people that shouted that really
[1:09:45] wasn't changed i know there's been
[1:09:47] people that's danced that really wasn't
[1:09:49] changed but what about the ones that
[1:09:50] were changed what about the ones that
[1:09:52] did get something what about the ones
[1:09:54] that did break through they mentioned
[1:09:56] more than just a youth camp to more than
[1:09:58] just the winston that service i'll tell
[1:09:59] you where they are they're still
[1:10:00] standing they're not standing by their
[1:10:02] power they're not standing by their mind
[1:10:04] they're standing by the true word amen
[1:10:07] see abraham received an enduring
[1:10:09] experience which caused him to rest upon
[1:10:12] the promise for 25 years he said how
[1:10:14] little it was for abraham that after he
[1:10:17] endured as seeing him who was invisible
[1:10:20] how after he met god and had an
[1:10:22] experience of talking face to face with
[1:10:24] god that he could call those things
[1:10:26] which was not as though they were and he
[1:10:28] could call those things which were so
[1:10:30] they're not he said for he had talked to
[1:10:32] god face to face that's what we need is
[1:10:35] a personal experience with the living
[1:10:37] god well brother andrew is that possible
[1:10:39] amen it's very possible because what
[1:10:41] happens is when the personal experience
[1:10:43] comes in the church it burns out all the
[1:10:45] dullness you see sometimes you can get
[1:10:48] dull of hearing you can get dull of sin
[1:10:50] you can get dull of believing the bible
[1:10:52] said that the people's heart is waxed
[1:10:54] gross and their ears are dull of here
[1:10:56] and their eyes they have clothes but at
[1:10:58] any time they should see with their eyes
[1:11:00] and hear with their ears and understand
[1:11:01] with their heart and should be converted
[1:11:03] and i should heal them so a true
[1:11:06] experience produces a conversion where
[1:11:08] does this conversion come from amen it
[1:11:10] can be a same old man
[1:11:12] living in the same old house wearing the
[1:11:14] same old clothes looking the same away
[1:11:16] but if something has come on the inside
[1:11:18] of him he can be in the same flesh
[1:11:21] wearing the same clothes but he can be
[1:11:23] changed forever in the presence of god
[1:11:26] oh god listen friends i know there's
[1:11:28] people amen i'll tell like this a young
[1:11:30] lady told me one time she'd come to a
[1:11:31] youth camp i was ministering she come in
[1:11:34] that youth camp she had always been
[1:11:35] raised in the message always been in
[1:11:37] church but it never been able to release
[1:11:39] herself in the presence of god she would
[1:11:41] go to church both grandfathers were
[1:11:43] pastors but she come in the service one
[1:11:45] night and i was ministering a thought
[1:11:47] amen on a change and when i was
[1:11:48] preaching about a change something
[1:11:50] struck her i never seen her do it before
[1:11:52] but she ran across the front of the
[1:11:54] church like that i thought that's very
[1:11:55] odd for that young lady to be doing that
[1:11:57] she went back home and her mom and daddy
[1:12:00] didn't even know who she was her
[1:12:02] grandfather who was her pastor didn't
[1:12:04] even know who she was i said what do you
[1:12:06] mean they said there had been such a
[1:12:07] change over her they said the first
[1:12:09] service she was back she wanted to sing
[1:12:11] a special he said we never could get her
[1:12:13] to sing we wanted she wanted to testify
[1:12:15] we never could get her to testify listen
[1:12:17] friends even though you don't see the
[1:12:19] change it doesn't mean that a change has
[1:12:21] not taken place oh god friends listen
[1:12:24] we're living in the hour where changes
[1:12:26] are taking place while the word is being
[1:12:28] preached amen you may not see it but
[1:12:30] right now cancers are having to back up
[1:12:32] at the word of god you may not see it
[1:12:35] amen but demon strongholds are having to
[1:12:37] give way to the power of the word of
[1:12:40] almighty god it don't matter what
[1:12:42] condition your flesh is in if the word
[1:12:44] has preeminence amen the word brings the
[1:12:46] change and if the word brings a change
[1:12:48] in the church it'll be a true change
[1:12:51] it's gonna be a change it'll be a change
[1:12:53] of heart not the physical thing but the
[1:12:56] heart of the soul it's something anchors
[1:12:58] you to your thoughts this way is dull
[1:13:01] and you don't see that no more you just
[1:13:03] see the lord you just see his
[1:13:04] righteousness and holiness and purity
[1:13:06] and love and grace that's when you've
[1:13:08] been changed what does it mean to
[1:13:10] convert it means to change something
[1:13:12] over amen and your thoughts and your
[1:13:14] habits and your being has been changed
[1:13:18] your thoughts and your habits and your
[1:13:21] being and your nature has been changed
[1:13:23] amen from a sinner to a christian the
[1:13:26] first thing you know it in your heart
[1:13:28] then you express it with your lips and
[1:13:30] then it materializes that's what you are
[1:13:33] listen friends amen you know it in your
[1:13:35] heart so therefore something comes
[1:13:37] across your lips and you begin to bless
[1:13:39] the lord you begin to worship his name
[1:13:41] and something begins to materialize well
[1:13:44] around that promise can i preach for a
[1:13:46] minute amen what about what about our
[1:13:48] young sister who came up for prayer in
[1:13:50] the prayer line a few years ago for her
[1:13:52] brother justin to come back to god it
[1:13:54] was in her heart that god could do it
[1:13:56] and she spoke it across her lips that
[1:13:58] god could do it amen and it wasn't five
[1:14:00] years it wasn't two years it was just a
[1:14:03] few moments and what had happened in her
[1:14:05] heart had been spoken across her lips
[1:14:07] had materialized before your very eyes
[1:14:10] listen friends we're living in the hour
[1:14:11] where the miraculous is becoming
[1:14:13] material
[1:14:14] in the church of living god we ain't got
[1:14:16] to back up and wait for god to
[1:14:18] materialize his promises elohim has come
[1:14:21] down in this generation to make good
[1:14:23] every promise he has made the church oh
[1:14:25] brother andrew it's not essential to
[1:14:28] believe that things can materialize it's
[1:14:30] very essential to believe things can
[1:14:32] materialize amen it's very essential to
[1:14:34] believe that the holy ghost can still
[1:14:36] get prodigals it's very essential to
[1:14:38] believe that the holy ghost can still
[1:14:40] heal cancer it's very essential to
[1:14:42] believe that the holy ghost can still
[1:14:44] erase cars it's very essential to
[1:14:46] believe that the holy ghost can still
[1:14:48] change young people it's very essential
[1:14:50] to believe even that the supernatural
[1:14:53] can come into a meeting and can change
[1:14:55] your life in five minutes and it'll be
[1:14:57] changed forever it's very essential to
[1:14:59] believe that god is still god and his
[1:15:02] word is still true and his power is
[1:15:04] still here and his anointing is still
[1:15:06] among us to bless us all it may not be
[1:15:08] essential to an intellectual christian
[1:15:11] but it is very essential to an
[1:15:13] experimental holy ghost field fire
[1:15:16] baptized tongue talking vision sin
[1:15:18] message preaching son of god it's the
[1:15:20] essentials
[1:15:23] it's the essentials of the church come
[1:15:25] on now
[1:15:28] i don't know if the holy ghost is
[1:15:29] essential the prophet said it's
[1:15:30] absolutely essential and necessary and
[1:15:33] compelling and compulsory that you
[1:15:36] receive the holy ghost for if you don't
[1:15:38] then you cannot come in the resurrection
[1:15:40] well brother andrew i believe the
[1:15:41] message that's got to be enough that's
[1:15:44] not enough
[1:15:45] to see the end time message you must
[1:15:48] have a true experience see god has
[1:15:50] called us somebody shout god
[1:15:52] has called us to be witnesses in the age
[1:15:55] we're living god has never been without
[1:15:58] a witness he has always had at least one
[1:16:00] man he could put his hands on and say
[1:16:03] that's my witness see somebody is going
[1:16:06] to witness for god somewhere
[1:16:08] oh glory somebody is going to witness
[1:16:11] for god somewhere somebody is going to
[1:16:14] receive a real change and they're not
[1:16:16] going to be ashamed to witness in their
[1:16:18] hospital they're not going to be ashamed
[1:16:19] to witness in their church they're not
[1:16:21] going to be ashamed to witness in their
[1:16:22] school somebody is going to meet god's
[1:16:25] requirement to be a witness which is an
[1:16:27] experience what does acts 1 8 say ye
[1:16:30] shall receive power after that the holy
[1:16:32] ghost has come upon you and you shall be
[1:16:35] my witnesses i love this word witness it
[1:16:38] means a martyr it means a witness sense
[1:16:40] in a legal sense it is those who after
[1:16:43] his example have proved the strength and
[1:16:45] genuineness of their faith in christ
[1:16:48] amen by undergoing a violent death see
[1:16:50] then the spiritual
[1:16:52] application of that definition is a new
[1:16:54] birth is a death
[1:16:57] a new birth is a death i hope it's okay
[1:16:59] a new birth is a death that's why jesus
[1:17:02] would say except the corn of wheat fall
[1:17:04] in the ground amen and die it abideth
[1:17:06] alone but if it what if it die it
[1:17:09] bringeth forth much fruit any birth is a
[1:17:11] mess if it's in a pig pen if it's in a
[1:17:14] barnyard if it's in a pink hospital room
[1:17:16] it'll it'll be a mess it'll do things
[1:17:19] that you wouldn't think you would do oh
[1:17:21] but you know before you can be born you
[1:17:23] have to die and some people die awful
[1:17:26] hard
[1:17:28] some people die awful hard they kick and
[1:17:31] they bawl and they scream and carry on
[1:17:34] but unless a corn of wheat dies and
[1:17:36] falls in the ground it abides alone if
[1:17:39] you want to bring forth fruit die to
[1:17:41] yourself your own man may theology and
[1:17:43] be born again in the spirit and
[1:17:45] resurrection get rid of that old
[1:17:47] self-righteousness and dryness that's in
[1:17:49] you and take on the new life see that
[1:17:52] when what god requires amen is the sound
[1:17:54] of death god does not require amen our
[1:17:57] abilities he requires the cell to death
[1:17:59] it's in the bible that there were two
[1:18:01] men who went to the same temple to pray
[1:18:03] one of them was a publican and the other
[1:18:04] one was a pharisee the bible says the
[1:18:07] pharisee come in the temple and begin to
[1:18:09] rehearse to the lord everything he had
[1:18:10] done i've done this and i've done that
[1:18:12] and i've done this he said but then the
[1:18:15] man left there amen the same way he came
[1:18:17] but the republican came in and he got
[1:18:20] down before god and he said i don't have
[1:18:22] anything good to bring you i don't have
[1:18:24] any good thing to offer you and the
[1:18:25] bible says that man left the house of
[1:18:27] god justified and the other man left in
[1:18:30] another condition well if the republican
[1:18:32] left justified pray tell me what
[1:18:34] condition the pharisee left him i'll
[1:18:36] tell you what kind of condition he left
[1:18:37] him he left in a dignified condition
[1:18:39] because his pappy is the father of all
[1:18:42] dignity but we're not a bunch of
[1:18:43] dignified believers we are justified
[1:18:46] believers who have been justified by the
[1:18:48] faith of jesus christ and the sounds of
[1:18:51] death that come out of our lives we have
[1:18:52] died the old man and the new man has
[1:18:55] been born he said oh bless god what god
[1:18:57] wants today is you to die amen die to
[1:19:00] the things of this world and yourself
[1:19:01] and hear a scream lord take me as i am
[1:19:05] that's what god wants he wants the sound
[1:19:07] of death that death rather of an old man
[1:19:09] adam that's dying amen he might come in
[1:19:12] and take his place and rule you and live
[1:19:14] in you do you realize just anybody
[1:19:16] cannot come in and be a real witness of
[1:19:19] god you've got to be selected to be a
[1:19:21] witness the bible says to be a witness
[1:19:23] for the lord you've actually got to know
[1:19:25] something i'm turning the corner here if
[1:19:27] that's okay to be a witness for god
[1:19:29] you've actually got to know something
[1:19:31] look at daniel 11 32 it says as such as
[1:19:34] do wickedly against the covenant shall
[1:19:36] he corrupt my flatteries i love this but
[1:19:38] the people that do know their god shall

[1:24:36] condition it's been something i haven't
[1:24:38] been able to get away from for a while
[1:24:39] after reading the quote he said the word
[1:24:41] of god will defeat the devil anywhere
[1:24:44] anytime any place under any condition he
[1:24:47] said if it's an alliance then the world
[1:24:49] will defeat him there if it's in a
[1:24:50] hospital bed laying there with cancer
[1:24:53] the world will defeat him there he said

[1:24:56] accident they've been bleeding to death
[1:24:59] and the word of god will defeat the
[1:25:01] devil right there now come on church
[1:25:03] those are some pretty tough conditions
[1:25:05] those are some pretty harsh conditions
[1:25:07] you imagine laying in an automobile
[1:25:09] accident and the blood leaving your body
[1:25:11] and you still got the authority to cast
[1:25:14] out the devil brother madam said that
[1:25:16] about the year brother philip of 1958 do
[1:25:18] you realize what happened in 1965 a

[1:25:48] her back is broke there's a prophet of
[1:25:50] god in an automobile accident the blood
[1:25:53] leaving his body but the gift of
[1:25:55] discernment is still flowing because
[1:25:57] it's not based upon emotion it was not
[1:25:59] based upon an intellectual conception it
[1:26:01] was based upon a true experience that no
[1:26:04] matter where you put this word it'll
[1:26:06] work oh god no matter where you put this
[1:26:10] word it'll work you can put it in a
[1:26:12] hospital it'll work there you can put it
[1:26:15] in the lines then it'll work there you
[1:26:17] can put it amen you can put it in the
[1:26:18] graveyard i'm on now church amen we
[1:26:21] buried some loved ones that are laying
[1:26:23] in the graveyard tonight their bodies
[1:26:24] are but let me say this you can put them
[1:26:26] in the deepest darkest crave but if the
[1:26:29] word is there you cannot stop the word
[1:26:31] the word will work regardless of the
[1:26:34] conditions
[1:26:37] hormones hurts you can bury them in the
[1:26:39] deep iceland you can put them in the
[1:26:41] jungles and i'm on friends there is our
[1:26:43] believers amen who were eaten by lines
[1:26:46] and were done away with through the
[1:26:48] waste of those animals but some morning
[1:26:50] between six and nine they're going to
[1:26:52] come back together i'll tell you why
[1:26:54] because the word works regardless it
[1:26:58] doesn't matter the condition it doesn't
[1:27:00] matter the situation the word will
[1:27:02] overcome the devil anywhere anytime
[1:27:05] anyplace under any condition well we're
[1:27:08] not in a lion's den tonight we're not in
[1:27:10] a hospital bed tonight we're not in
[1:27:12] automobile accidents with the blood
[1:27:14] flowing from our body but we are in the
[1:27:16] house of god and we've got mighty needs
[1:27:18] among us let me say this right here
[1:27:20] tonight on wednesday nights the same
[1:27:22] word that worked for daniel we'll work
[1:27:24] for lemur the same word that worked for
[1:27:26] jonah will work for aaron the same words
[1:27:29] that work for moses will work for andrew
[1:27:32] it is a word that works regardless of
[1:27:34] the conditions
[1:27:38] you put the word anywhere you want to
[1:27:40] and it's going to work
[1:27:41] oh come on friends i'm going somewhere
[1:27:44] if you get a true word experience you
[1:27:46] will be following a true word and the
[1:27:48] word will be made flesh that's why the
[1:27:50] devil don't want you to become the word
[1:27:52] because wherever you are the limits are
[1:27:54] taken off of god and the word has the
[1:27:56] ability to work
[1:27:59] now don't don't let the devil tell you
[1:28:01] well i got to be something special amen
[1:28:03] i've got to be in some terrible
[1:28:04] condition the word works right here he
[1:28:06] said the devil has done everything he
[1:28:08] can
[1:28:09] to stop this little church and this
[1:28:12] little flock from rising up and
[1:28:14] fulfilling the words he said see the
[1:28:16] devil wants them to be powerless he said
[1:28:18] but i'll say this he said there would be
[1:28:21] and there will be a people who will know
[1:28:24] their god and will be strong in the last
[1:28:26] days see then i'll sit like this we are
[1:28:28] not eyewitnesses we're not just ear
[1:28:31] witnesses we are heart witnesses amen we
[1:28:34] have come to the promise of the holy
[1:28:36] ghost now let me just say this many
[1:28:38] people today have two different kinds of
[1:28:40] experiences one of those experiences is
[1:28:42] a natural experience can i tell you what
[1:28:44] a natural experience is amen it's not
[1:28:46] enough but the other experience is a
[1:28:49] spiritual supernatural experience and it
[1:28:51] is more than enough do you realize what
[1:28:53] a church experience is it's a natural
[1:28:55] experience you can get an experience
[1:28:57] with the church and it will only hold
[1:28:59] you for so long look what jesus said he
[1:29:02] said no man puts new wine into old
[1:29:04] bottles else the new wine will burst and
[1:29:06] the bottles be spilled and the bottle
[1:29:08] shall perish amen the bible says amen
[1:29:11] that this bride will not perish amen
[1:29:13] then that tells me there's got to come a
[1:29:15] change in order to hold what will come
[1:29:17] into you and it will not burst and
[1:29:18] perish he said that's the way you take
[1:29:20] the baptism of the holy ghost put it in
[1:29:22] an old dry formal cow hide it'll blow up
[1:29:25] as sure as the world but you try to take
[1:29:27] the baptism of the holy ghost with an
[1:29:29] old experience of some long drawn out
[1:29:31] church experience it'll blow up as sure
[1:29:33] as the world amen but new wine said
[1:29:35] jesus amen all goes in new bottles and
[1:29:38] the new bibles is flexible that's the
[1:29:40] way god's church must be for revival
[1:29:43] it's flexible well brother andrew glory
[1:29:44] to god i'm ready for the bride's revival
[1:29:46] and you get mad and blow up because
[1:29:47] somebody got your parking spot well i'm
[1:29:50] ready for the bride's revival and you're
[1:29:51] mad because somebody didn't shake your
[1:29:53] hand well but then i'm ready for the
[1:29:54] bride's revival and brother tim ain't
[1:29:56] called me in six weeks and he ain't
[1:29:58] called my name behind the pulpit in two
[1:30:00] years and you're ready for the bride's
[1:30:01] revival that is no condition to carry
[1:30:04] the most i'm on church you you know what
[1:30:06] kind of people you got to be you got a
[1:30:08] people that be that can take a licking
[1:30:10] and keep right on ticket they can take
[1:30:12] your parking spots they can take your
[1:30:13] favorite seats they cannot call your
[1:30:15] name for two years they can forget you
[1:30:17] even attend the church but you'll say
[1:30:19] i'm not here because brother tim called
[1:30:21] my name i'm not here because i got a
[1:30:24] good parking spot i'm here because
[1:30:26] before the foundation of the world he
[1:30:29] put my name on the lamb's book of life
[1:30:32] come on church you mean to tell me that
[1:30:34] somebody taking your seat is going to
[1:30:36] cause you to turn around we need some
[1:30:38] rugged warriors we need some believers
[1:30:40] that'll stand up and say i'll fight the
[1:30:42] good fight of faith if i got to fight in
[1:30:44] the parking lot and i got to fight it by
[1:30:46] myself i am not a weak christian i am a
[1:30:49] rugged christian i can take a look and
[1:30:52] you can offend me and i'll keep on going
[1:30:54] you can hurt my feelings and i'll keep
[1:30:56] brother tim you can ignore me for two
[1:30:58] whole years and i still pray the holy
[1:31:00] ghost will anoint you to whip every
[1:31:01] devil this time in mississippi i'm on
[1:31:04] church i'm not talking about a bunch of
[1:31:05] people it's just pawn somewhere i'm
[1:31:08] talking about true words true
[1:31:10] experienced christians that no matter
[1:31:12] what conditions you put them under
[1:31:14] they're going to worship god they're
[1:31:15] going to praise god they're going to
[1:31:17] bless his name they're going to lift the
[1:31:19] raptures off the house and let a wasp in
[1:31:21] time world know there's a people here
[1:31:23] who knows him in the power of this
[1:31:25] resurrection regardless of what we're
[1:31:28] going through regardless of who hurt our
[1:31:30] feelings we know who we are
[1:31:35] come on church over there ain't nobody
[1:31:37] hurt my feelings we'll stick around a
[1:31:39] few days and they'll get hurt
[1:31:41] we're humans but i'm asking you are you
[1:31:43] in a position not with god to say god
[1:31:46] i'm here for the fact
[1:31:48] i'm here to fight i'm here to push
[1:31:50] through yes sir you've got to be
[1:31:52] flexible brother andrew surely surely a
[1:31:54] a church experience is good enough no
[1:31:57] sir because the prophet of god said that
[1:31:59] the rich young ruler had a good church
[1:32:01] experience he said but the problem was
[1:32:04] he lacked a personal experience with
[1:32:06] jesus christ he said his mother mother
[1:32:08] was a good mother his father was a good
[1:32:10] father and he knowed the bible real well
[1:32:13] but he lacked something that was able to
[1:32:15] hold him you realize what the prophet
[1:32:17] says he says see it must be a
[1:32:20] supernatural experience amen can i
[1:32:23] preach a little bit what does paul say
[1:32:25] he said that i may know him somebody
[1:32:27] shall know him
[1:32:29] no shout out like you're a true
[1:32:30] experienced believer i may know him
[1:32:33] i may know him and the power of the
[1:32:36] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:32:37] sufferings being made conformable unto
[1:32:40] death so paul here is saying i'm not
[1:32:42] just an experienced christian that knows
[1:32:44] him in the power of his resurrection but
[1:32:46] let me know him in the power of his
[1:32:47] sufferings i love this word no it means
[1:32:50] to perceive it means to understand it's
[1:32:52] what gets me to the greeks it means to
[1:32:54] know facts but those facts may or may
[1:32:56] not affect one's conduct but to the jews
[1:32:59] i love this to the jews true knowledge
[1:33:02] always manifested itself in one's
[1:33:04] conduct one did not know something until
[1:33:07] that fact had a practical outworking in
[1:33:10] his life so in other words it had to
[1:33:12] make an 18-inch trip from his head to
[1:33:14] his heart the greeks could know it in
[1:33:16] their head and it never affect their
[1:33:18] conduct but to the jews when they really
[1:33:20] knew what they were talking about it had
[1:33:22] changed more than the way they think and
[1:33:24] it changed more than the way they
[1:33:25] thought and it changed the way they
[1:33:27] conducted themselves in other words you
[1:33:29] could put them in a trial and they would
[1:33:31] still conduct themselves with joy amidst
[1:33:34] that trial you could put them on a
[1:33:35] partly cloudy sunny day
[1:33:38] that's
[1:33:40] i might as well preach up here joe asked
[1:33:42] me the day at camp he said what's
[1:33:43] weather gonna be like tomorrow that's
[1:33:44] what's gonna be partly clear cloudy and
[1:33:46] partly cloudy and sunny it's gonna be
[1:33:47] cloudy and sunny he said how can it be
[1:33:49] cloudy and sunny at the same time i said
[1:33:51] i mean it's going to be partly cloudy
[1:33:53] and sunny at the same time listen
[1:33:55] friends you've got to quit serving god
[1:33:57] based on the conditions that's around
[1:33:58] you or you'll never have any victory
[1:34:00] you've got to serve god regardless well
[1:34:02] over there and as long as my best
[1:34:04] friend's here and they can child i'll
[1:34:05] serve god listen you've got to be able
[1:34:07] to serve god if your best friend walks
[1:34:08] away from the message you'll still be
[1:34:10] standing you've got to be able to serve
[1:34:12] god if the clouds are in the sky or if
[1:34:14] the sun is shining god is looking for
[1:34:17] somebody who will come under his word
[1:34:19] and receive a true experience let me say
[1:34:21] it like this he does not want this
[1:34:22] message to just work on tape he does not
[1:34:25] want it just to work on pictures he
[1:34:26] wants this message to find a channel to
[1:34:29] have a practical outworking in your life
[1:34:31] that's why paul would say the word of
[1:34:33] god which we received was not of men but
[1:34:35] it was of the truth amen which
[1:34:37] effectually worketh in you that believe
[1:34:40] he said see the blood of him talk like
[1:34:41] this he said there was no indian one
[1:34:43] time he said indian had two dogs he said
[1:34:45] which one do you feed the most he said
[1:34:47] whichever one i feed the most is the one
[1:34:49] that wins chief he says depend on that
[1:34:51] he said see but if you listen to the
[1:34:53] certain sound he said god's word work it
[1:34:55] in your heart you'll conquer this when
[1:34:57] he says you won't feed that black dog
[1:34:59] you'll feed the white dog he said and
[1:35:01] the certain sound will produce god
[1:35:03] working out of your heart can i read you
[1:35:05] another one in this sodom age what
[1:35:07] happened to abraham would return back
[1:35:09] again to abraham's royal seed which is
[1:35:11] in christ and christ's returning in the
[1:35:14] form of the word working in human beings
[1:35:16] and sowing the signs that he promised it
[1:35:19] would sign it would do listen friends
[1:35:21] you are the channel that god has
[1:35:23] ordained for his word to return to in
[1:35:25] the most evil conditions of seven ages
[1:35:28] and that same word have the same effect
[1:35:30] and power today that it had the day it
[1:35:32] was wrote
[1:35:35] now brother andrew i've had an
[1:35:37] experience well let's ask moses what
[1:35:39] kind he had he said moses was a god
[1:35:41] called man a prophet he said he had to
[1:35:43] have a supernatural experience so no man
[1:35:47] has a right to call himself us until
[1:35:49] he's talked face to face with god on the
[1:35:51] back side of a desert somewhere where he
[1:35:53] met god himself are you ready for this
[1:35:55] and all the atheists in the world could
[1:35:58] not explain it away from him from him he
[1:36:00] was there he knowed it happened all the
[1:36:03] atheists in the world could not explain
[1:36:06] in a way listen in other words moses
[1:36:08] could be standing at the burning bush
[1:36:10] and he'd see the thing on fire he would
[1:36:12] see it on fire and not consumed and
[1:36:14] leave the burning bush for the ale and
[1:36:16] run into one atheist and that atheist
[1:36:18] could talk him out of it he could run
[1:36:20] into another atheist and that atheist
[1:36:22] could talk
[1:36:23] now come on friends because do you
[1:36:24] realize we're living in a world where
[1:36:26] there's still atheists you say all the
[1:36:27] atheists in the world according to
[1:36:29] sociologists study i don't know these
[1:36:31] guys names but a review of numerous
[1:36:34] global studies on atheism there are 450
[1:36:37] to 500 million positive atheist and
[1:36:40] agnostic worldwide
[1:36:42] 450 to 500 million positive agnostics
[1:36:47] and atheists in the world seven percent
[1:36:50] of the world's population with china
[1:36:52] having the most atheists in the world at
[1:36:54] 200 million amen convinced atheists
[1:36:57] brother brother timothy something
[1:36:58] strikes me there there's seven percent
[1:37:01] that are positive and there's 200
[1:37:03] million that are convinced amen
[1:37:06] those two words where have i heard those
[1:37:07] two words before oh that's right he
[1:37:09] meant a positive experience amen a
[1:37:12] positive gospel a positive faith will
[1:37:15] produce the convinced son of god that'll
[1:37:17] be concerned what are you saying brother
[1:37:18] andrew i'm saying this if you get a true
[1:37:21] word experience in your heart you can
[1:37:23] meet all 450 to 500 million you can meet
[1:37:27] all 200 million you can meet seven
[1:37:30] percent of the world's population and
[1:37:32] they can tell you god don't do that and
[1:37:34] god don't do that no more but you would
[1:37:36] stand there and you would draw your
[1:37:37] sword and you would fight through every
[1:37:39] one of them because what you received
[1:37:41] put a confidence in you it released the
[1:37:44] faith in you to persevere towards a goal
[1:37:47] oh friends tonight
[1:37:48] what i'm trying to get at is this amen
[1:37:50] that god knew you before the foundation
[1:37:53] of the world therefore he sent you a
[1:37:54] true word that would be accompanied by a
[1:37:56] true experience that would lead you
[1:37:58] beyond the curses of your family it
[1:38:00] would lead you beyond the situations of
[1:38:01] your childhood it would bring you beyond
[1:38:03] the hope so into a no soul amen let me
[1:38:06] say this this true experience will take
[1:38:08] you beyond any shadow of doubt of
[1:38:10] missing the rapture it'll take you on
[1:38:12] any side of it out that god don't do
[1:38:14] what his word says he does anymore if
[1:38:16] it's written in his words your heart
[1:38:18] agrees with it then heaven cannot back
[1:38:20] you off of it sickness cannot back you
[1:38:22] off of it amen because the fruit of this
[1:38:24] supernatural experience is a possessor
[1:38:27] who can say i know
[1:38:29] i know
[1:38:30] a true possessor can say i know i know
[1:38:33] my redeemer liveth i know messiah's
[1:38:35] coming amen i know that he who touched
[1:38:38] my eyes amen has healed me whereas i
[1:38:41] once was blind now i see i know and
[1:38:44] those who don't know nothing about it
[1:38:46] are the ones that's going to give you
[1:38:48] the biggest fight those that don't
[1:38:49] believe god does hats are the ones
[1:38:51] that's going to give you the biggest
[1:38:52] path but can i give you something to
[1:38:53] fight with can i give you something to
[1:38:55] fight with they overcame him by the
[1:38:57] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[1:38:59] their testimony if god done something
[1:39:02] for you this weekend draw that testimony
[1:39:05] and beat that devil to a pulp and let
[1:39:07] him know i am not the same person i was
[1:39:10] when i went to camp i'm not the same
[1:39:12] young girl i'm not the same young man
[1:39:14] those demons of fear those demons of
[1:39:16] anxiety those demons of complexes
[1:39:19] they've got a goal
[1:39:21] they've got to go listen friends i
[1:39:23] believe this is the hour when god has
[1:39:25] delivered his church by a true word
[1:39:28] through a true experience amen can i
[1:39:30] testify to you for a minute can i talk
[1:39:32] to you for a second the other day up in
[1:39:33] the youth camp there in cloverdale at
[1:39:35] the end of one of the services the
[1:39:36] spirit of the lord just moved across me
[1:39:38] and i said i rebuke that inferiority
[1:39:40] complex i caused that thing to leave by
[1:39:42] the word of almighty god there was a
[1:39:44] young man come to me after service he
[1:39:46] said andrew he said for the past few
[1:39:48] months he said i'm a husband i'm a
[1:39:50] father he said but for the past few
[1:39:52] months i've been becoming a recluse he
[1:39:54] said i've been pulling away from
[1:39:55] fellowship i've been pulling away he
[1:39:57] said when i get around other believers
[1:39:59] he said i don't feel like i've got
[1:40:00] anything to add to the conversation he
[1:40:02] said i've been in a mind battle he said
[1:40:04] and i've been wondering what it is he
[1:40:05] said but god sent you all the way up
[1:40:07] here to call out what it is he said can
[1:40:09] you tell me what an inferior complex is
[1:40:12] i said it's a complex it's put upon you
[1:40:13] by a devil that makes you feel inferior
[1:40:16] to somebody else and i said we're not in
[1:40:18] fear to nobody we ever once stand level
[1:40:21] at the cross of jesus christ he said
[1:40:23] when you said that the chain of that
[1:40:24] inferiority complex broke off of my life
[1:40:27] he said all i needed was to be exposed
[1:40:29] i'm on friends we're living in the hour
[1:40:31] when the very minute the devil is
[1:40:33] exposed he has lost his hold on you the
[1:40:36] very minute the word says exposes that
[1:40:39] devil he's got to relinquish every life
[1:40:41] i'm on church you've been letting the
[1:40:43] devil hold you back for years let me say
[1:40:45] this the devil is defeated because the
[1:40:48] word has exposed that devil amen let me
[1:40:52] say this whatever god has done for you
[1:40:54] don't you back off of it don't you turn
[1:40:56] around on it amen you go light the world
[1:40:58] on fire with an experience of god jesus
[1:41:01] said you are the light of the world
[1:41:02] you're a city that sat on a hill amen
[1:41:05] the hill cannot hide neither do men
[1:41:07] light a candle and put it under the
[1:41:09] bushel amen but on a candlestick and it
[1:41:12] gave light to all that are in the house
[1:41:14] you know what that word candle means
[1:41:15] it's something that is placed on a stick
[1:41:17] or a candle stick amen it is a lamp or
[1:41:20] like an eye which shows the body which
[1:41:22] way to move amen and term it is the
[1:41:24] prophecies of the old testament insomuch
[1:41:27] as they afforded at least some knowledge
[1:41:29] relevant to the glorious return of jesus
[1:41:32] from heaven oh god i could preach here
[1:41:34] for an hour it is the old testament
[1:41:36] prophecies as they afford it at least to
[1:41:38] some knowledge relevant to the glorious
[1:41:41] return of jesus from heaven then jesus
[1:41:43] turns and says let your light so shine
[1:41:46] before men that they may see your good
[1:41:49] works and glorify your father which is
[1:41:51] in heaven fake it not strange church
[1:41:53] that god would set you on fire right
[1:41:56] before he returns think it not strange
[1:41:58] that right before he returns he would do
[1:42:01] something in your life that would lift
[1:42:02] you up above your peers it would lift
[1:42:04] you up above education it will lift you
[1:42:06] up above religion and let a lost and
[1:42:08] dying world know that there's somebody
[1:42:10] on the earth who the church cannot stop
[1:42:12] who the fellowship of the devil cannot
[1:42:14] hand hinder them because the holy spirit
[1:42:17] has made demonstration and is making the
[1:42:19] word a reality in their lives
[1:42:22] now i want i want to drive a few things
[1:42:24] home and i'm going to close the brother
[1:42:25] has asked a question do you believe that
[1:42:27] signs should follow all who have the
[1:42:29] holy spirit well jesus said so in mark
[1:42:31] 16 if so what about the people who
[1:42:34] believe the message with all that's in
[1:42:35] them yet they have not these signs are
[1:42:37] the unbelievers or do they need the holy
[1:42:39] spirit if so please instruct us today on
[1:42:42] how to receive the holy ghost we believe
[1:42:44] you're god's mouthpiece for our day he
[1:42:46] said see thank you my dear brother you
[1:42:48] cannot receive the baptism of the holy
[1:42:51] ghost without having an experience when
[1:42:54] it happens if you believe every speck of
[1:42:56] the word you say you believe that the
[1:42:58] word is laying in there waiting for the
[1:43:01] holy spirit to put it to work but it's
[1:43:03] like lighting the candle here's the
[1:43:05] candle with the wick in it and with all
[1:43:07] the tallow and everything it has to have
[1:43:09] in the candle but until the fire comes
[1:43:11] on it it will not shine any light you
[1:43:14] can have a house full of candles but if
[1:43:16] you don't have no fire amen they'll just
[1:43:18] be candles you can be in darkness you
[1:43:20] can be surrounded by darkness come on
[1:43:22] church and if you don't have some fire
[1:43:24] to set that candle on fire it'll just be
[1:43:26] a candle no matter how perfect the
[1:43:28] candle is how perfect it'll burn it's
[1:43:31] got to be lit and then it burns and when
[1:43:33] you believe and are made up of the
[1:43:35] instructions of what the holy spirit is
[1:43:37] love joy peace long suffering amen the
[1:43:39] fruits that bears out he says until the
[1:43:42] holy spirit where the fiery experience
[1:43:44] comes down and lights that candle then
[1:43:47] you haven't received the holy ghost let
[1:43:49] me say this fire puts the cannon used
[1:43:52] and without the fire the candle gives no
[1:43:54] light and without the fire the candle
[1:43:56] gives no fragrance amen the fire is what
[1:43:59] reveals the potentials of the candle oh
[1:44:01] glory to god no wonder the devil don't
[1:44:04] want you to meet the pillar of fire no
[1:44:05] wonder the devil don't want you to
[1:44:07] receive a fiery baptism of the holy
[1:44:09] ghost because when that fire strikes
[1:44:11] your life it is going to release every
[1:44:12] potential and it's on the inside of you
[1:44:14] well let me tell you what kind of
[1:44:15] potentials are in you greater is he that
[1:44:18] is in you than he that is in the world
[1:44:20] you've got the potentials to overcome
[1:44:22] you've got the potentials to tear down
[1:44:24] you've got the potentials to cross over
[1:44:26] every bridge the devil puts it come on
[1:44:28] church you've got the potentials i say
[1:44:31] tonight what we ought to do is we ought
[1:44:32] to welcome the fire of god into the
[1:44:35] church to set the candles on fire to set
[1:44:37] the young people on fire to set the
[1:44:39] preachers on fire to set the singers on
[1:44:42] power let the holy ghost experience set
[1:44:45] the church on fire until the fire
[1:44:47] reveals the potentials that's laying in
[1:44:49] you
[1:44:51] unknown church that's why the devil
[1:44:53] wants you to remain cold because the
[1:44:55] coldness will not reveal the potentials
[1:44:57] that's why the devil wants you to remain
[1:44:58] indifferent is because the indifference
[1:45:00] will not reveal the potential that's why
[1:45:02] the devil wants you to be bound up by
[1:45:03] complexes is because the complex will
[1:45:06] never release the potential that god has
[1:45:08] put in you but if the fire ever touches
[1:45:10] you if the fire touches your life if the
[1:45:13] fire comes upon your heart if the fire
[1:45:16] comes upon your family if the fire comes
[1:45:18] upon your ministry glory to god it'll
[1:45:21] release the potentials of god
[1:45:25] oh somebody let the power of god come in
[1:45:27] the church let the fire god set the pews
[1:45:30] let the fire god set every elder on fire
[1:45:33] if the fire comes in the church the fire
[1:45:35] will reveal the potentials are you
[1:45:37] hearing me the fire will reveal the
[1:45:40] potentials you realize what else the
[1:45:41] fire will do the fire will reveal the
[1:45:43] hidden power
[1:45:45] the fire will release what's been landed
[1:45:47] i'm going you ever heard that saying get
[1:45:49] somebody in the clutch and then you'll
[1:45:50] see how they really are get somebody in
[1:45:52] the taunts touch but i heard it said
[1:45:54] like this one time amen have a whole car
[1:45:56] load full of friends amen they'll all

[1:51:31] become impressed by a heavenly
[1:51:34] revelation there was no turning him

[1:55:15] he said i've been preaching i've been
[1:55:17] praying i've been working day and night
[1:55:19] he said i've been standing the prayer
[1:55:21] lines and praying till about fell over
[1:55:23] he said i went down there and saw my
[1:55:25] wife and my baby in that condition and
[1:55:27] he said the devil
[1:55:28] come to me and reminded me
[1:55:30] of everything i did
[1:55:33] let me just say this
[1:55:34] your works ain't strong enough to hold
[1:55:35] you
[1:55:38] he said the devil come and whispered in
[1:55:40] my ear you're really going to believe
[1:55:42] him now
[1:55:43] and begin to lift up begin to list off
[1:55:44] all the things he'd been doing for him
[1:55:48] all the hours in the prayer lines and
[1:55:50] all the meetings and all the sacrifices
[1:55:52] he said i was listening to him and he
[1:55:54] said what he was saying was the truth
[1:55:57] what he was saying and he said i was
[1:55:59] just about to the point
[1:56:01] he said i was just about to point to say
[1:56:04] that's right there boy i guess he don't
[1:56:06] love me he said that he swept down
[1:56:09] glory to come
[1:56:12] he swept down and he said though you
[1:56:16] slay me
[1:56:17] yet i will trust you
[1:56:19] he said that he spoke come on friends
[1:56:21] his own abilities couldn't hold him but
[1:56:24] an experience with a true word could
[1:56:25] hold him in the darkest hour of his life
[1:56:28] and out of that trial comes some of the
[1:56:29] greatest blessings
