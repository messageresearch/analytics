[44:30] brother Timothy also to minister the
[44:33] words of life and we saw the Holy Spirit
[44:37] just move hey man god bless you brother
[44:40] Johnny good to see you today
[44:42] and each one of you that is assembled
[44:44] with us a man so we today as we just
[44:49] approach the throne of grace and looking
[44:51] to God we want to turn to the Bible and
[44:54] Titus chapter 2 verse 11 and we want to
[44:58] read from there today as we just look to
[45:02] the Lord and ask for his grace to us
[45:05] today Titus 2:11 but the grace of God
[45:09] bring us salvation hath appeared to all
[45:14] men teaching us denying ungodliness and
[45:18] worldly lusts that we should live
[45:21] soberly righteously and godly in this
[45:24] present world looking for that blessed
[45:27] hope and the glorious appearing of the
[45:31] Great God and our Savior Jesus Christ
[45:35] amen you believe he's our great God and
[45:38] Savior a man Redeemer and we're looking
[45:43] forward to to that glorious appearing
[45:46] it's Our Blessed hope and man I've ever
[45:49] believer here today and for you're
[45:52] seated I'm going to read just a little
[45:54] little quotation from the testimony of a
[45:58] true witness so if we are a Christian
[46:01] and we're born of the Spirit
[46:04] death can hold nothing but victory for
[46:07] us because this old corruptible body
[46:10] that Satan still has power over will
[46:13] drop into the dust of the earth this is
[46:16] a wrong season now
[46:17] is mortal season when the but the
[46:23] immortal season is coming when the
[46:26] immortal one comes he will bring with
[46:29] him the immortal spirits that has
[46:31] returned to him from the earth and they
[46:34] will come forth again in the
[46:35] resurrection for the great millennium
[46:37] and shine in his glory
[46:39] hey man god bless you you can't be
[46:42] seated we're gonna speak today as we
[46:46] just kind of bringing along our subject
[46:49] again as we've been talking about the
[46:52] coming of the Lord and we want to
[46:54] rejoice in that blessed hope this
[46:57] morning because that is our only hope
[47:00] when we see sin abounds and when
[47:03] iniquity abound in and evil on every
[47:06] hand we know then they only hope we have
[47:09] is in Jesus coming back being prepared
[47:12] for that great day when we will be
[47:15] gathered there with him but so Paul was
[47:20] telling Titus that we're looking for
[47:23] that blessed hope and the glorious
[47:24] appearing and as we shared with you a
[47:27] little quotation from brother Branham
[47:29] that we're in the wrong season right now
[47:32] it's a mortal season and in this mortal
[47:35] season there's sin and death and sorrow
[47:37] and sickness and pain and every other
[47:40] thing that goes with being mortal but
[47:43] when the immortal one comes you know
[47:46] it's going to change seasons and and yet
[47:50] you know we have had great things that
[47:53] have happened in our day we've seen the
[47:55] Holy Spirit move as a fig tree would put
[47:58] forth her bud and all the other tree's
[48:00] and we're in a time in an hour of
[48:02] restoration we have seen the heavens
[48:05] open and seven angels step forth from
[48:08] there and reveal the seven seals and and
[48:12] uh an anointing the mighty angel Christ
[48:16] coming down in Revelation chapter 10
[48:19] which is a great anointing and
[48:22] outpouring of his spirit upon the earth
[48:24] as we know the scripture said he would
[48:27] pour out his
[48:28] spirit in the last days and yeah and yet
[48:32] that is that is of course we can look
[48:35] back to revelation 10 and we can say
[48:37] that isn't a the immortal one but yet
[48:41] it's not it is not the completion
[48:43] because it is not the Corporal and
[48:46] physical return of our Lord and so we
[48:50] are still here in the mortal season a
[48:52] man no matter how much we have seen God
[48:56] move and we certainly have yet we're
[48:59] still here in the mortal season and so
[49:02] the immortal one that we're looking for
[49:04] has not come but we are looking for his
[49:09] return and I think this should be the
[49:12] hope that we have is ever believer that
[49:15] Jesus is coming back to earth again hey
[49:20] man we're gonna meet him in the air and
[49:22] this time but yet he will also come to
[49:24] the earth and take over the earth for
[49:25] the millennium ahead Nepal teaches us in
[49:29] Ephesians that when Jesus ascended he
[49:32] took with him those that had been held
[49:34] captive in the grave and this is of
[49:38] course when he left the earth after his
[49:41] resurrection that when he rose that the
[49:45] dead in Christ rose also and the Apostle
[49:49] is referred to what Jesus did at the
[49:51] grave for he descended first to the
[49:54] lower parts of the earth and we find
[49:57] this in a piece in chapter 4 in verse 8
[50:00] and Paul is actually quoting the
[50:03] scripture from the book of songs and so
[50:06] this is why he begins of saying
[50:08] wherefore he saith so he is actually
[50:11] referring back to the Psalms where that
[50:14] under the Spirit of God the anointing
[50:17] was spoke and the word was prophesied
[50:20] and he said when he ascended on high he
[50:23] led captivity captive and gave gifts
[50:25] unto men so as another translation would
[50:29] say this is why the scriptures say when
[50:32] he ascended to the heights he led a
[50:35] crowd of captives and gave gifts unto
[50:38] his people or again he is
[50:41] send it into the heavenly heights taking
[50:44] his many captured ones with him and
[50:48] gifts were given unto men and then it
[50:52] and then he goes on and explains in
[50:54] verse nine that he ascended but he also
[50:58] descended first in the lower parts of
[51:02] the earth and so he deceived that the
[51:06] Senate is the same that I send it far
[51:09] above all heavens now these these are
[51:12] going to be some very key point as we we
[51:15] talked today about where Jesus is now
[51:19] because that's what we're wanted to
[51:21] speak to you where is Jesus now we're
[51:24] looking for him to come back but where
[51:26] is he now what is he doing now
[51:29] what is this present office and what is
[51:32] the work he's doing hey man so we want
[51:35] to know where he is and then how he will
[51:38] come and so we're going to be speaking
[51:40] on that today where is Jesus now so now
[51:44] so he said what what does he does what
[51:47] does he ascended mean except also he
[51:51] descended to the lower earthly regions
[51:53] or into the depths of the earth he who
[51:56] descended is the very one who ascended
[51:59] higher than all the heavens to in order
[52:03] to feel the whole universe so Poland
[52:07] establishes he ascended to the highest
[52:10] level of all heavens this is where that
[52:16] he resides her abides today is in the
[52:20] highest realm of heaven now if you look
[52:25] with me to first Peter chapter 3 and
[52:27] verse 18 he says for Christ also has
[52:31] suffered once for sin now there just for
[52:34] the unjust then he might bring us to God
[52:37] being put to death in the flesh but
[52:39] quickened by the spirit that means made
[52:42] alive by the spirit but which also he
[52:45] went and preached unto the spirits in
[52:47] prison which sometimes were disobedient
[52:51] when what
[52:53] and the long-suffering of God waited in
[52:55] the days of Noah while the ark was a
[52:58] preparing wherein few that is eight
[53:00] souls were saved by water so we know
[53:03] that the Bible teaches us that when when
[53:07] Jesus died that he was alive still
[53:10] living though he had left his corporal
[53:13] body in the grave right it was in the
[53:16] tomb but yet he is still alive and he
[53:19] had descends into the lower parts of the
[53:22] earth
[53:23] and man he is active he is preaching he
[53:28] is speaking there even in the regions of
[53:31] the loss and identified himself as the
[53:34] fulfillment of the scripture a man to
[53:38] those who repented not in the days of
[53:40] Noah this is an illustration has given
[53:43] he his shows that he actually appears
[53:47] into the reasons of the loss and
[53:49] identifies himself as a fulfillment of
[53:52] Scripture are you with me a man but you
[53:57] saw but but I want you to get it that
[53:59] not only did he visit the realm of the
[54:03] Lost but he also goes to the realm of
[54:06] the blessed where the Saints in paradise
[54:09] are waiting and they have been waiting
[54:12] for this Redeemer to come now for
[54:14] thousands of years Adam has been in the
[54:17] grave now for thousands of years
[54:19] Methuselah Noah on and on and on have
[54:23] been down in the grave right down to the
[54:25] prophets that would be down to the ages
[54:29] Jeremiah Isaiah Ezekiel Malachi they're
[54:33] all there and they're all waiting and
[54:35] they're waiting on Jesus to come I want
[54:40] you to get a picture now the Saints
[54:42] these Old Testament Saints they are
[54:44] waiting on Jesus to come the Redeemer
[54:48] because they can't come in the presence
[54:50] of God yet because they have no blood
[54:52] that will remove some all they have is a
[54:57] substitute atonement that only rolled in
[55:00] a head the debt of Santa head until the
[55:04] Redeemer could come and pay the price
[55:06] but when Jesus comes remember when he
[55:10] appears there and the regions of the
[55:14] blest this is called Abraham's bosom or
[55:17] in paradise he appears there to bring to
[55:21] them to take those who were in captivity
[55:24] in a holding place and take them captive
[55:28] and lead him out as the trophies of his
[55:34] blood and the victory that's in Jesus
[55:37] are you with me now because the reason
[55:41] why I'm going through all of this
[55:43] because the same thing is gonna happen
[55:44] here at this in time hallelujah the dead
[55:48] in Christ are waiting for Jesus to come
[55:51] amen they're under expectation for him
[55:54] to come to them are you with me Amen so
[55:58] so again just like they were expecting
[56:01] the Redeemer to come in the Old
[56:03] Testament the New Testament Saints are
[56:05] now waiting under the altar waiting for
[56:09] Jesus to come back you think you're
[56:12] longing for Jesus come back they are to
[56:16] man and they would submit their voice
[56:19] can be heard back up on the earth by
[56:21] prophet of God screaming out cheering
[56:24] him on and say you know you know press
[56:26] the battle you don't know what lays at
[56:30] the end of the road I mean you don't
[56:33] understand all the joys get your eyes on
[56:36] the goal don't look at the here and now
[56:41] in the troubles that are around get your
[56:42] eyes on the goal and that because Jesus
[56:45] is going to come back hallelujah now
[56:51] let's look at him as he a sins now
[56:54] because as he ascends into paradise and
[56:58] and again it is they were not in hell
[57:01] they were they you know the Bible says
[57:05] of the rich man he lifted up his eyes
[57:07] and hell and saw Abraham the bosom of
[57:11] Abraham so it was an around higher than
[57:14] hell
[57:15] hey man and so but yet now Jesus in his
[57:19] ascension after going to the desert
[57:22] preaching to the spirits that were lost
[57:24] in prison comes up and he comes now into
[57:27] another round and it's around my
[57:30] paradise and this is what happens when
[57:33] he ascends as he comes up this is all a
[57:36] part of his ascension as here Isis he's
[57:38] gonna raise somebody with him
[57:40] so in Matthew 27 verse 50 Jesus when he
[57:44] cried again with a loud voice yielded up
[57:47] the ghost and behold the veil of the
[57:49] temple was rent in twain from top to
[57:51] bottom in the earth did quake and the
[57:53] rocks rent and the graves were opened
[57:57] and many of the bodies of the saints
[58:01] which slept arose and came out of the
[58:03] graves after his resurrection and went
[58:07] into the holy city and appeared unto
[58:09] many so we see when they raised they
[58:13] came right into this dimension of time
[58:16] of light matter in time and they
[58:20] appeared unto many oh now we get a
[58:25] picture of what is going to happen in
[58:28] our resurrection our man when the living
[58:31] remembered the living shall remain the
[58:35] dead in Christ shall be gathered
[58:37] together amen and we will see them but
[58:43] this time friends were not going to
[58:44] remain in the same condition this time
[58:50] when we see them we're gonna be changed
[58:52] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[58:54] they couldn't be changed back there
[58:57] because maybe because it was not time it
[59:01] was so it was going to be a Gentile
[59:03] dispensation and more time but we're at
[59:05] the end and we're right here on the very
[59:09] edge of the daddy in Christ rising are
[59:14] you with me I'm not now so Jesus went
[59:18] into the heavens now because he would
[59:21] have sinned and he would have sinned
[59:23] and be taken up the Bible we could
[59:26] describe it taking up in a cloud receive
[59:29] out of their sight and they would be
[59:31] told in the book of Acts
[59:32] this same Jesus will come again in like
[59:36] manner hallelujah in other words there's
[59:40] going to be a physical corporal return
[59:42] of Jesus Christ what we will see him and
[59:46] on another but eyes will see him for
[59:49] ourselves and we'll be caught up to meet
[59:52] the Lord in the air now Jesus went to
[59:57] the heavens to take a position there to
[1:00:01] intercede and I want you to get this
[1:00:03] point he is there to intercede until
[1:00:05] every name on his book is manifested on
[1:00:09] the earth so he's got a whole list of
[1:00:13] names he knows you're coming and he's
[1:00:15] been waiting on you to get here hey man
[1:00:19] all the saints are you with me all the
[1:00:22] Saints are waiting waiting for that last
[1:00:26] ones to finish the race and we're right
[1:00:30] here this is why brother Branham could
[1:00:31] hear them scream and press the battle
[1:00:34] I'm impressed the battle you don't know
[1:00:37] what lays at the end of the road you
[1:00:39] know you don't know the joys it lays
[1:00:41] ahead and that says what Jesus did he
[1:00:44] ran the race for the joy that was set
[1:00:47] before him and we got to keep our eyes
[1:00:51] on the joy the joy of a new body the joy
[1:00:57] of the dead since risin I'm at the joy
[1:01:01] hallelujah I've never another sinful
[1:01:04] thought never evil deed never another
[1:01:07] problem come on somebody the joy the joy
[1:01:10] of being United with our Redeemer
[1:01:13] forever
[1:01:14] that's how we gotta run this rate so
[1:01:17] look into the joy this is why Paul would
[1:01:22] say that blessed hope of his appearing
[1:01:26] well I say never you know we must never
[1:01:29] take that hope away from the church
[1:01:32] we must never over spiritualize it until
[1:01:37] we we count that as fulfillment we must
[1:01:41] look at this and realize there is coming
[1:01:45] more than just a spiritualization of
[1:01:47] this event and a man it's gonna
[1:01:50] materialize
[1:01:52] you know in obtains of our corporate
[1:01:55] bodies and a meeting of Jesus Christ
[1:01:58] what a promise audience now ever since
[1:02:03] his death at Calvary where he paid sins
[1:02:06] price and then a sinning of the heaven
[1:02:09] Jesus has resided on the throne of God
[1:02:12] and it's not a separate throne it is the
[1:02:16] throne of God it's not two Thrones
[1:02:18] sitting up there but it is it is it is
[1:02:22] Jesus there residing on the throne of
[1:02:26] God making a way for us to the throne
[1:02:32] now this is very important that we begin
[1:02:34] to understand because this has made the
[1:02:37] throne of Almighty God a throne of mercy
[1:02:41] it's made it a throne of grace a seat of
[1:02:45] mercy and I just want to add it's not
[1:02:47] for ignorance alone
[1:02:49] hey man but it's for the sins and
[1:02:52] unbelief of all times he has been on the
[1:02:56] mercy seat so we could find favor or
[1:02:59] grace in our time of need
[1:03:01] I'll refer to this again but Hebrews
[1:03:04] 4:16 said let us come boldly unto the
[1:03:07] throne of grace I want you to understand
[1:03:10] two things is a throne but it's a throne
[1:03:13] of grace is a throne of mercy that we
[1:03:16] may obtain mercy
[1:03:18] so you see it's a throne of mercy or
[1:03:21] otherwise we wouldn't be able to obtain
[1:03:22] mercy
[1:03:24] and find grace to help in the time of
[1:03:27] need now because of the sacrifice of
[1:03:32] Christ our lamb we can come boldly but
[1:03:39] now notice I want you to get a picture
[1:03:41] here that for right now until Satan is
[1:03:45] cast down how do we know he's not been
[1:03:47] cast down because he becomes incarnate
[1:03:50] in the Beast and at the same time the
[1:03:53] pride leaves from here because we're not
[1:03:57] going to be here when Satan is full king
[1:03:59] of the earth right
[1:04:01] hey man so again again window when Satan
[1:04:05] is cast down the bride goes up I want
[1:04:08] you to see a picture here because Satan
[1:04:11] has a right to stand in the heavens and
[1:04:14] there accuse us before God that's what
[1:04:19] Satan can do right now
[1:04:20] let me repeat again Satan stands in the
[1:04:24] heavens nap how are you with me before
[1:04:29] the throne of God to accuse you before
[1:04:33] God but I want you to understand
[1:04:39] something else you have one setting on
[1:04:42] the throne that is your mercy
[1:04:45] [Music]
[1:04:48] hallelujah Amen that when you approach
[1:04:51] this strong that you approach it through
[1:04:54] the sacrifice through this mediator
[1:04:57] through this redeemer to find grace
[1:05:02] hallelujah that's not just for you
[1:05:04] that's for every person it's for the
[1:05:07] sins of the whole world it's for the
[1:05:10] lowest sinner here among us or the last
[1:05:13] one that has lost their way that anybody
[1:05:16] can come and approach that throne of
[1:05:18] grace but you can't approach it without
[1:05:24] Jesus you cannot approach it without
[1:05:34] accepting the atonement of the sacrifice
[1:05:38] now we're going to get a picture because
[1:05:42] the Bible tells you some very clear
[1:05:44] things that will happen here in the end
[1:05:46] time
[1:05:46] it says the Sun will be darkened the
[1:05:50] moon will not give its light there's
[1:05:53] coming a time upon this earth as she
[1:05:55] moves into the tribulation when the
[1:05:57] bride leaves there will be no bride here
[1:05:59] to give light the light of the word will
[1:06:03] no longer be shone upon the Gentile
[1:06:05] world and the Sun will be darkened and
[1:06:08] stars will fall from the heavens there's
[1:06:12] to be a movement in the heaven and great
[1:06:13] earthquakes upon the earth some of these
[1:06:15] are physical some of these are even have
[1:06:18] spiritual application but there will be
[1:06:20] stars to fall now you know you know if
[1:06:23] you're just a teeny bit scientific at
[1:06:27] all and and knowledge of science you
[1:06:29] know if the Sun turned dark for any
[1:06:32] length of time this world would freeze
[1:06:34] over right we also know that it stars
[1:06:39] fell to the earth all the stars found
[1:06:41] the earth there wouldn't be enough room
[1:06:42] to can contain all the stars in the
[1:06:45] heavens so he's not speaking about
[1:06:48] something physical he is talking about
[1:06:51] something that is happening in the
[1:06:54] happens where stars will fall and these
[1:07:00] stars are not going to be planets and
[1:07:03] solar systems and this and that they're
[1:07:07] going to be the fall of angels now I'm
[1:07:12] going to just show you in the Bible
[1:07:14] revelation 12 and 7 I want you to get
[1:07:17] this picture because this right here
[1:07:19] describes our rapture brother branham
[1:07:22] tells us in the first seal in the fourth
[1:07:24] seal and and through our and other
[1:07:27] places and the seals at Revelation 12 is
[1:07:30] right here when the when Satan is cast
[1:07:33] down the bride goes up so we're going to
[1:07:36] look at this picture right here because
[1:07:38] the Bible tells you that at the coming
[1:07:41] of the Lord in this event and this this
[1:07:43] event of his coming from the rapture to
[1:07:46] his second coming where he of where he
[1:07:48] comes with the Saints and actually we
[1:07:52] call that the third coming and can refer
[1:07:55] to it as the third coming because
[1:07:57] because but in all reality the what we
[1:08:01] call the second coming the rapture he
[1:08:03] never comes to the earth we meet him in
[1:08:05] the air so it's kind of second coming
[1:08:08] where he's coming back to the earth is a
[1:08:10] different event than the rapture there's
[1:08:13] different things that will happen but in
[1:08:16] this event up between there between the
[1:08:19] rapture and his second coming or this
[1:08:21] where he comes back to take the world
[1:08:23] over again for the Millennium there's
[1:08:25] going to be some great changes that
[1:08:27] happens on the earth there's going to be
[1:08:30] where the wrath of God is poured out
[1:08:33] upon the earth there's going to be where
[1:08:35] Satan himself is cast down again and I
[1:08:40] want to get to this picture to you again
[1:08:42] because he was already once cast out he
[1:08:46] was cast out there there when he exalted
[1:08:49] himself and we'll read about it in
[1:08:50] Isaiah 12 that he where he exalted
[1:08:53] himself above all that is called God he
[1:08:56] wanted to be God so he comes to earth
[1:08:58] and he becomes her he is kicked out of
[1:09:01] the heavens after descending this even a
[1:09:04] third of the angels the Bible said a
[1:09:06] third of the
[1:09:07] of heaven fell so their way then we get
[1:09:10] it again stars fell angel swell and the
[1:09:14] transgression because sin began in
[1:09:16] heaven didn't begin on the earth it
[1:09:18] beginning to heaven and they begin with
[1:09:22] these words I will words Satan an angel
[1:09:27] who had the ability to make choices
[1:09:31] somebody help me to preach now shows one
[1:09:35] day to exalt his will over God's will
[1:09:39] and from there began the original sin
[1:09:42] and now it comes down the earth and
[1:09:45] moves upon Eve there to exalt her will
[1:09:48] over God's will now we're going to place
[1:09:51] these pieces here in a moment but let's
[1:09:54] just go to Revelation chapter 12 verse 7
[1:09:57] because I want you to see him he's the
[1:09:59] accuser of the Brethren and that's what
[1:10:02] he's doing now
[1:10:03] future home brother branham said Satan
[1:10:06] right now can accuse us before God so
[1:10:11] he's still the accuser of the Brethren
[1:10:13] and as long as areas an accuser we must
[1:10:16] have an intercessor
[1:10:21] now just to jump ahead just a minute and
[1:10:24] I'll read you where the Prophet said but
[1:10:26] brother Branham said I do enough in one
[1:10:28] hour to be to be sowed into hell forever
[1:10:33] that was him
[1:10:35] what about you when we talk about the
[1:10:41] holiness of God no one dare approach him
[1:10:44] without the blood of Christ and I don't
[1:10:47] care how great these people think that
[1:10:50] they are now so what we're the bride
[1:10:52] we're this and that without the blood
[1:10:53] you have no approach to God amen
[1:10:58] now in Revelation chapter 12 verse 7 and
[1:11:02] there was war in heaven so now we see
[1:11:05] our thermals in heaven Michael and his
[1:11:09] angels fought against the Dragon and the
[1:11:11] dragon fought and his angels now we see
[1:11:14] a great war in this against Michael and
[1:11:17] the Michael Michael is
[1:11:19] in a battle and Michael is is represents
[1:11:22] the Archangel who is like Jehovah is
[1:11:25] what his name means is a Mike L which is
[1:11:28] AE L is representative Elohim he who is
[1:11:32] like Elohim
[1:11:34] so it's an angelic form of Jesus all
[1:11:39] right is that the authentic form of
[1:11:42] Jesus and there he fights against the
[1:11:45] Dragon and the dragon fought and his
[1:11:47] angels are you with me now and I'm at
[1:11:52] now you say not brother Jim are you sure
[1:11:55] about this about Michael let me tell you
[1:11:56] Jesus is our only answer and this one is
[1:12:02] interceding or fighting on our behalf
[1:12:05] and Jesus is that intercessor he's
[1:12:10] depicted now as Michael and his angels
[1:12:13] fought against the Dragon and the dragon
[1:12:15] fought and his angels this is an endtime
[1:12:19] battle God's fighting on your behalf to
[1:12:23] bring you to glory so there should be a
[1:12:26] rapture in this day man now there's a
[1:12:29] big fight there's a turmoil going on and
[1:12:31] I idols would like to say it's going on
[1:12:34] right now and the dragon over Nona
[1:12:40] what's and verse eight and I like this
[1:12:41] and prevailed not are we like reading
[1:12:46] that because we can read the results
[1:12:50] before it ever even happens the prophecy
[1:12:53] says he will prevail man let me just say
[1:12:58] again the devil will prevail whatever
[1:13:01] you're fighting against and warned
[1:13:03] against today he will not prevail
[1:13:08] you're gonna prevail over it notice
[1:13:12] prevailed not neither was their place
[1:13:15] how in the world did they have a place
[1:13:20] neither was their place found any more
[1:13:24] in heaven how in the world do they have
[1:13:27] a place in heaven
[1:13:31] look now verse 9 and the Great Dragon
[1:13:35] was cast out that old serpent called the
[1:13:37] devil now we know who the dragon was
[1:13:39] he's the same old serpent that beguiled
[1:13:42] Eve right and he's called the devil and
[1:13:46] Satan which deceiveth the whole world
[1:13:48] and he was cast out into the earth and
[1:13:52] his angels were cast out with him now
[1:13:54] brother Branham explains this he said
[1:13:56] when he's cast out
[1:13:57] he becomes incarnate in in the the the
[1:14:01] beach system in the Antichrist and will
[1:14:04] become incarnate in a man are you with
[1:14:07] me so far
[1:14:09] we're not there but it lays real close a
[1:14:14] map now and notice here and he says and
[1:14:19] I've heard I love this and I heard a
[1:14:24] loud voice in heaven now we're getting
[1:14:26] the scene change here Satan man Castle
[1:14:29] earth but now we're going to see
[1:14:31] somebody in heaven but loud voice in
[1:14:34] heaven saying now is come salvation and
[1:14:36] strength and the Kingdom of our God and
[1:14:39] the power of his Christ now we see here
[1:14:43] in his final victory is finally attained
[1:14:47] you said well it was done at Calvary yes
[1:14:49] it was initiated at Calvary but remember
[1:14:53] he's got to reign until every enemy is
[1:14:55] under his feet are you with me my man so
[1:15:00] he is there to reign his intercessor
[1:15:02] until his enemies are under his feet
[1:15:07] Norris and he says now is come salvation
[1:15:12] strength the kingdom of our God the
[1:15:16] power of his Christ what's now for the
[1:15:19] accuser
[1:15:21] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[1:15:23] down which accused them before our God
[1:15:27] day and night now again they had a place
[1:15:32] in heaven how did they get there because
[1:15:35] we can go to Isaiah chapter 14 and verse
[1:15:38] 12 and we can see where Satan has been
[1:15:42] cast down out of heaven how art thou
[1:15:46] fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the
[1:15:48] morning how art thou cut down to the
[1:15:51] ground which to this week in the nation
[1:15:54] for that was said in thine heart I will
[1:15:56] ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[1:15:59] throne above the stars of God I will all
[1:16:02] sit also upon the Mount of the
[1:16:04] congregation in the sides of the north
[1:16:07] notice these these words remember
[1:16:10] beautiful for situation is Mount Zion in
[1:16:13] the size of the North the city of our
[1:16:16] Great God
[1:16:17] so Satan says I want to church I want
[1:16:21] God's church and we can see him as he as
[1:16:25] an antichrist begin to move all the way
[1:16:28] from the beginning moving us away from
[1:16:30] the original enthronement of God and the
[1:16:33] end the sealing of the spirit and the
[1:16:35] pouring out of the Holy Ghost although
[1:16:37] it didn't here he comes inside out of
[1:16:39] Christ moving in and he winds up
[1:16:42] according to Thessalonians sitting in
[1:16:45] the temple of God showing himself that
[1:16:47] he is gone and is worshiped and then
[1:16:52] Revelation says he's worshipped by
[1:16:54] millions all the world will worship Him
[1:16:59] are you with me hey man so he says he
[1:17:04] says I will ascend in the Allsop on the
[1:17:08] Mount of congregation and the sides of
[1:17:10] the north I will ascend above the
[1:17:13] heights of the cloud I will be like the
[1:17:16] Most High yet thou shalt be brought down
[1:17:20] to hell to the sides of the pit so God
[1:17:24] that prophesizes that you desire to
[1:17:27] ascend
[1:17:28] but this is what's going to happen to
[1:17:30] you you're gonna fall you'll be brought
[1:17:33] down to the pit hey man this whole world
[1:17:38] is getting wicked her and wicked her and
[1:17:40] more and more ripe with sin and it's
[1:17:42] making a very place for the devil to
[1:17:44] come but it's gonna be his trap not his
[1:17:49] victory are you with me you see this has
[1:17:53] always been Satan's desire to be God
[1:17:55] it's a very temptation he used an Eden
[1:17:58] to get Eve to disobey God you shall be
[1:18:00] as gods
[1:18:02] Lucifer was cast out of heaven because
[1:18:05] of his sin and his pride a pride and his
[1:18:08] desire to be God remember Isaiah is it
[1:18:14] Isaiah 28 when that shows him as a
[1:18:17] hovering the covering cherub and how
[1:18:20] that that you know that he was he was
[1:18:23] beautiful and and was once a a covered
[1:18:26] cherub he was once I'll protect your the
[1:18:29] word he was writer what's up right hand
[1:18:31] man that God as it were he gets kicked
[1:18:35] out of heaven because he exalts itself
[1:18:39] he takes his own selfish ambitions and
[1:18:42] places it over the Word of God but now
[1:18:46] he's cast down the earth and here he
[1:18:47] comes and he's looking for a way to get
[1:18:50] back now he finds a serpent which is
[1:18:56] next a man which has no soul that he can
[1:18:59] enter into so now he has a body he can
[1:19:02] work through but now he comes here to
[1:19:06] Eve and he begins to reason the word EA
[1:19:09] has God said and presses on to her the
[1:19:14] desire or the thought you can be as God
[1:19:20] now and when he does now this one who's
[1:19:25] been kicked out of Heaven's comes to the
[1:19:28] earth here he comes now
[1:19:29] the one who is deceived angels deceive Z
[1:19:33] now Adam looks at it he looks at here
[1:19:36] and here here
[1:19:38] this is bone of his bone in life of his
[1:19:40] life are you with me
[1:19:42] this is his flesh this is a part of him
[1:19:46] a man without her are you with me let
[1:19:51] man let me just say something caught God
[1:19:53] can't just destroy her and Adam just go
[1:19:57] on in order to bring forward are you
[1:20:01] with me in order to be fruitful and
[1:20:03] multiply he's got to have Eve so he
[1:20:07] can't just so ever destroyed and start
[1:20:11] all over again
[1:20:12] but she's fallen so what he does is he
[1:20:16] goes and takes on her sin are you with
[1:20:21] me and there dies with her in order for
[1:20:27] redemption
[1:20:28] well as far fetched brother Jim well
[1:20:31] that's what Jesus did
[1:20:33] he can't be complete without you he
[1:20:37] can't be complete without me he's gotta
[1:20:40] have a bride are you with me he can't
[1:20:44] leave you in Siena so he came down to
[1:20:47] the top your sin and take the penalty of
[1:20:50] your sin on himself in order to bring
[1:20:57] you back to God again you can't make
[1:21:05] this stuff up it was just a beautiful
[1:21:10] story of redemption Oh God he'll never
[1:21:15] forget you I don't care how lost and
[1:21:19] backslidden and away from him you've
[1:21:22] been he'll never forget you he's gonna
[1:21:26] find his own no matter where they are
[1:21:28] he's gonna find his own
[1:21:32] ha tonight what I hope that ought to
[1:21:36] give us this morning what a joy that
[1:21:39] ought to give us so now Adam now let's
[1:21:50] just look at him for a minute
[1:21:52] he's a dual nature he lives here
[1:21:55] in a corporal body although we could
[1:21:57] call it corporal fleshly body made out
[1:22:00] the dust it's not it's still at this
[1:22:03] time there's no important it's still
[1:22:06] immortal
[1:22:06] he's walking now as close as long as
[1:22:09] he's in fellowship with God his body
[1:22:12] will never die right it'll never die as
[1:22:18] long as he keeps God's Word he'll never
[1:22:21] die never sickness everything's brought
[1:22:24] under control
[1:22:26] hey man he's there like a millennium and
[1:22:31] the lion lays down by the lamb and eat
[1:22:34] straw like the Bullock nothing hurts are
[1:22:38] destroying all my holy mountain he
[1:22:41] dresses the garden with the power from
[1:22:44] another round now I want you to get a
[1:22:47] picture here because he's on the earth
[1:22:49] but his throne Adam's throne reaches
[1:22:53] from heaven to earth because he's ruling
[1:22:57] the earth from heaven from Heaven's
[1:23:01] atmosphere from Heaven's power from
[1:23:03] Heaven's throne from Heaven's dominion
[1:23:06] and as long as he's there and with that
[1:23:09] seat in the heavens everything about it
[1:23:12] is subject to him but Satan now he's
[1:23:17] been kicked out of the heavens but now
[1:23:20] he wants this throne
[1:23:22] I'll get back I'll get back in the
[1:23:25] heavens now and to do that he's got to
[1:23:30] get Adam to become subservient to him
[1:23:33] and if he will subjugate himself to
[1:23:36] Satan and Satan become his ruler then
[1:23:40] Satan has a position and becomes the
[1:23:44] Prince of the power of atmospheres of
[1:23:46] the air hi ma'am
[1:23:51] remember this that's all going to be
[1:23:53] restored here in this last day because
[1:23:56] we meet Jesus in the air right now Satan
[1:24:01] is the prince and the power there but
[1:24:03] we're going to meet Jesus hallelujah in
[1:24:07] the air I meant back in opposition again
[1:24:11] a man and there begin listen listen
[1:24:15] listen the fall of the earth did not
[1:24:18] begin with animals it did not begin with
[1:24:21] the vines it did not begin with that it
[1:24:23] began with the king of the earth are you
[1:24:26] with me which was man now we restore man
[1:24:30] back to his original position then him
[1:24:33] in that position will restore animals
[1:24:35] and will adjust or write them down to
[1:24:37] every vine every Brier everything will
[1:24:40] be restored but you got to redeem man
[1:24:43] back to his position and this is what's
[1:24:47] been the problem we have been out of
[1:24:49] position hey man we have been out of
[1:24:54] position but there's a battle going on
[1:24:57] for our position I see men and women
[1:25:02] right now that are playing to Satan you
[1:25:04] can't stay there my man because Adam
[1:25:08] might have sold it but Jesus redeemed it
[1:25:10] and we're taking back our position as
[1:25:13] sons and daughters of God and right now
[1:25:15] we can save you safe and take your
[1:25:17] cancer off of God's people take your
[1:25:20] sickness and leave are you with me now
[1:25:26] so now through the fall of man he takes
[1:25:31] he takes a subjugated place it's not his
[1:25:35] position he is only there by permission
[1:25:39] whosever missing man's permission
[1:25:43] because Adam sold out tomb sold us all
[1:25:47] out
[1:25:49] now he stands there in the heavens
[1:25:53] asserting authority and accusing us
[1:25:57] and the reason he accuses us is to keep
[1:26:00] us from taking our position in other
[1:26:04] words saying you don't have a right to
[1:26:05] be a son you don't have a right to stand
[1:26:09] here you don't have a right for this
[1:26:11] position it was sold to me by Adam and
[1:26:15] because you were born and seen safe in
[1:26:18] iniquity because you came by the way of
[1:26:20] sexual birth you were all born my slaves
[1:26:23] and you have no right to this position
[1:26:26] of sonship hey man
[1:26:31] now we'll get to it in a minute but I
[1:26:33] would just want you to see this now then
[1:26:36] in Joel chapter 1 in verse 6 I want you
[1:26:39] to see this that there was a day when
[1:26:43] the sons of God came to present
[1:26:44] themselves before the Lord now so here
[1:26:47] sons of God are coming into God's
[1:26:49] presence and Satan came also among them
[1:26:53] now what in the world does he have a
[1:26:56] right there we have the right because of
[1:26:58] the fall hey man now and he's and the
[1:27:04] Lord said to Satan which cometh thou and
[1:27:06] the Satan man said the Lord and said
[1:27:08] I've been going forth is the to and fro
[1:27:10] to the earth and walking up and down in
[1:27:12] it
[1:27:13] I've been looking I have been looking
[1:27:16] for things to accuse the sons of God so
[1:27:20] they'll have no right to approach this
[1:27:22] throne I need the Lord said unto Satan
[1:27:31] well have you considered my servant job
[1:27:34] did you notice him there's not like him
[1:27:38] in the earth a perfect and an upright
[1:27:39] man and one that fears God and excuse
[1:27:42] evil and Satan accuses says does job
[1:27:46] fear God for nothing
[1:27:49] hast thou not made a hedge around him
[1:27:51] and about him and about his house and
[1:27:55] about all that he hath on every side and
[1:27:57] I was blessed the work of his hands
[1:28:00] his substances increased in the land so
[1:28:03] here here he begins to accuse job and
[1:28:07] say well the only reason he's serving
[1:28:10] you is for what he's getting out of you
[1:28:14] and then in chapter 2 where we could we
[1:28:17] could read again or is it chapter three
[1:28:19] no chapter two he will see Satan appears
[1:28:22] again and ask his permission he said but
[1:28:25] to attack his flesh and let me let me
[1:28:32] just tell you something
[1:28:36] by default Satan has a right to attack
[1:28:40] your body because of Adam's sin you say
[1:28:47] what God why did you let this happen to
[1:28:49] me well I'll tell you why because of
[1:28:51] Adam chose we would be born mortals and
[1:28:56] because of that we all die and because
[1:29:00] that we have sickness and pain and
[1:29:02] sorrow and death in trouble bad things
[1:29:05] happen to good people are you with me
[1:29:09] now but anyway he he said let me just
[1:29:13] touch his flesh
[1:29:14] he said because for man's flesh he'll
[1:29:18] curse you he's only serving you because
[1:29:21] of the heads you God and protection you
[1:29:25] will give because God does protect us
[1:29:28] many times he's kept you listen you
[1:29:31] think he's kept you from that accident
[1:29:33] he kept you from things you didn't even
[1:29:35] know about
[1:29:38] I'm Anna I'll just say this this isn't
[1:29:41] this wasn't the first time God healed
[1:29:43] sister Lana from cancer see I cancer
[1:29:46] many times and so of you it works at
[1:29:51] your body it's there to attack your
[1:29:53] cells a man but God said but God would
[1:29:56] draw a line and said no that's it
[1:29:59] and your body would raise up and throw
[1:30:01] it off and ma'am your body would raise
[1:30:08] up and throw it off where did where did
[1:30:10] that come from God put that in there hey
[1:30:15] mom
[1:30:15] that's why it's an important part of our
[1:30:18] our own duties to to try to take care of
[1:30:22] our bodies not sin against our bodies by
[1:30:25] doing things that will harm them are you
[1:30:28] with me
[1:30:29] but notice again you know there is
[1:30:32] another accusation if you go to
[1:30:34] Zechariah 3 and verse 1 we will see that
[1:30:37] gods that he showed me is Joshua the
[1:30:40] high priest standing before the angel of
[1:30:42] the Lord and and Satan standing at his
[1:30:46] right hand to resist him
[1:30:49] so here's Joshua now he's going to be
[1:30:53] the high priest and in the Israel at the
[1:30:56] restoration that is going on and and and
[1:30:59] we could go through the whole picture
[1:31:01] semen dirty garments and the change that
[1:31:03] has made everything that God did them to
[1:31:05] put him in position but but nevertheless
[1:31:08] even at the point that I want you to get
[1:31:11] right now is Satan was standing and his
[1:31:14] right hand to resist him well that's
[1:31:18] where Satan is he is also standing there
[1:31:22] resisting accusing but his time of
[1:31:28] accusation is about over because there's
[1:31:31] a war going on that's about to be won
[1:31:35] it was initiated at Calvary but it's
[1:31:38] going to be finished here in this last
[1:31:40] day hallelujah amen if you will I you
[1:31:45] know let me go back to to Revelation
[1:31:47] chapter 12 and verse 10 I want you to
[1:31:50] skip this again and I heard a loud voice
[1:31:52] in heaven now these these are the
[1:31:55] raptured Saints in heaven and they're
[1:31:57] saying now is come salvation and
[1:32:00] strength and the Kingdom of our God and
[1:32:03] the power of his Christ for the accuser
[1:32:05] of our brother is cast down which
[1:32:07] accused them before our God day and
[1:32:10] night give me the next verse verse 11
[1:32:12] and they overcame him hallelujah by the
[1:32:21] blood but yet not one drop of blood was
[1:32:25] shed for angels come on somebody this is
[1:32:29] more than angelic Bibles this is your
[1:32:33] battle and they overcame him that's the
[1:32:42] only way you can overcome that was his
[1:32:44] heart here's your part and the word of
[1:32:49] their testimony that's your part man he
[1:32:54] paid the price and you can pass it's
[1:32:57] done
[1:32:58] she forgave your sins and you can test
[1:33:01] it's done he gave you a pardon and you
[1:33:05] say I received that pardon he says I
[1:33:14] paid for your healing and you say I
[1:33:17] believe it so I receive it with all of
[1:33:22] my heart for they overcame him by blood
[1:33:25] and by the word of their testimony and
[1:33:28] they loved not their lives unto the
[1:33:30] death a man they an and so how wonderful
[1:33:36] this is now this is a voice in heaven
[1:33:39] this is the voice of the raptured Saints
[1:33:41] screaming back here's how we whipped him
[1:33:46] here's how we got victory hey man you
[1:33:50] ought to know that this morning here's
[1:33:51] how you get victory mmm because there is
[1:33:55] a sacrifice somebody help me preach
[1:33:57] because there is an atonement oh we got
[1:34:01] a new atonement today no brother Brendan
[1:34:03] said it was a restoration back to the
[1:34:06] original atonement
[1:34:07] I meant the blood of the Lamb and by the
[1:34:12] word of our confession brother Bentham
[1:34:16] said he cannot heal you until he you
[1:34:19] first confessed that he's done it now so
[1:34:25] again we we see this is where he comes
[1:34:28] he asserts authority listen brother
[1:34:31] branham in the fourth seal says this is
[1:34:35] paragraph 183 in the fourth seal notice
[1:34:37] now he'll be given the heart of the
[1:34:39] beast at that time and Satan will
[1:34:40] incarnated himself because when the
[1:34:43] church goes up Satan is cast out so as
[1:34:47] long as we're here on this earth still
[1:34:50] in the mortal realm a man Satan had been
[1:34:53] cast out but when when the church goes
[1:34:56] up Satan is cast out it's all done men
[1:34:59] and all of his accusing is done
[1:35:03] hallelujah hey man now he said look as
[1:35:07] long as the innocent
[1:35:09] were still on the throne Satan can stand
[1:35:12] there and accuse because he is the
[1:35:15] attorney on the other side he's the
[1:35:17] opponent of Christ and Christ he's
[1:35:20] standing there the opponent is standing
[1:35:22] there sales but wait Adam fell Adam did
[1:35:25] this I conquered him I got his wife to
[1:35:27] believe a lot and you said she'd be
[1:35:29] damned bud I got it and here the
[1:35:32] mediators tendon they're the kinsman
[1:35:34] redeemer standing there with the blood
[1:35:37] that can make the violence sinners heart
[1:35:39] take the solace in his heart and change
[1:35:42] it a mediator on the throne
[1:35:47] can't you see is this more than purchase
[1:35:50] ignorance because we didn't know that
[1:35:52] the word in pass ages and we lost the
[1:35:55] truths it's more than that
[1:35:57] it's because we were the vilest sinner
[1:36:01] take the vial of sinners heart and
[1:36:03] changes a man Satan says but they're
[1:36:07] guilty and Jesus says they're not

[1:36:33] from is a creation of creation had to
[1:36:35] come from a creator but all the
[1:36:37] chemicals that was manufactured and put
[1:36:39] together that broke up and just ever and
[1:36:43] that's just all there is to it there's
[1:36:45] no more of it and the very water
[1:36:47] substantive blends with the Clorox which
[1:36:50] is Isis amen glory to God it's all clean
[1:36:53] that win the blood of Jesus that's what
[1:36:56] the blood of Jesus does to a true child
[1:36:59] of God when he confesses that sin he
[1:37:02] stands there justified in his he serves
[1:37:06] mercy goodness

[1:38:17] mortals some people who get he'll get
[1:38:21] sick again believers still die trouble
[1:38:28] still comes because we're still in the
[1:38:30] realm of the mortals and no matter how
[1:38:33] much we've had great things happen in
[1:38:36] the heavens we're still here in the
[1:38:39] mortal drama but we're about to leave it
[1:38:47] there's war in heaven and there's a
[1:38:50] contention there I want you to see it
[1:38:53] every time I believe or prays or takes
[1:38:56] the stand on the Word of God
[1:38:58] it causes war you say sometimes brother

[1:39:06] because he calls to war so what I prayed
[1:39:09] for my kids and looks like they're worse
[1:39:11] because he calls to war
[1:39:14] hey man it's his cosy disturbance in the
[1:39:18] heavens are you with me well I got
[1:39:23] prayed for and I was seeking appeal were
[1:39:25] you cause the wall I man you took and
[1:39:30] stood for your position as a son of God
[1:39:33] and you got opposed it's not a time to
[1:39:37] give up
[1:39:38] it's not a time to quit I can read you
[1:39:42] the Bible he prevailed not

[1:39:50] prevailed not he'll not prevail over
[1:39:53] your children he'll not prevail over
[1:39:56] that sickness he'll not prevail he'll
[1:40:01] not prevail
[1:40:02] [Applause]
[1:40:11] we call the angels of glory to come down
[1:40:27] on your behalf I don't know brother Tim
[1:40:32] if all this is true well Ephesians 6:11
[1:40:35] he tells you you're in a battle put on
[1:40:38] the whole armour of God that you may be
[1:40:42] able to stand against the wiles of the
[1:40:45] devil for we wrestle not against flesh
[1:40:48] and blood but here's what we're fighting
[1:40:51] against principalities against powers
[1:40:54] against rulers of the darkness of this
[1:40:57] world against spiritual wickedness where
[1:41:04] high places in the heavenlies there is a
[1:41:12] battle that you're we are fighting in
[1:41:15] the heavenlies now this word this this
[1:41:20] word high places is exactly what it says
[1:41:24] in ephesians chapter 1 that he had made
[1:41:27] us to sit together in heavenly places
[1:41:29] with christ so he's made you to have
[1:41:32] dominion because of him or with him man
[1:41:36] but every time you step up to take a
[1:41:38] part of that promise of the word Satan
[1:41:41] is there to oppose you are you with me
[1:41:45] and he's going to do it he'll bring ever
[1:41:49] doubt do you bring ever fear he'll bring
[1:41:51] depression he'll bring unbelief he'll
[1:41:54] bring a host of Hell Kali saves us and
[1:41:58] he knows he's better G he knows when
[1:42:01] your weaknesses are and he's trying to
[1:42:04] get you to back down but when you've
[1:42:06] done everything to stamp
[1:42:09] therefore don't be a quitter with your
[1:42:17] loins Girt about your sword drawn where
[1:42:22] do you want your sword in your mouth
[1:42:24] that's where Jesus holds the sword is in
[1:42:28] the mouth in the out of his mouth goes a
[1:42:31] two-edged sword and out of your mouth
[1:42:33] it's got to come the Word of God the
[1:42:36] Lord rebuke you Satan I mean you you who
[1:42:41] has opposed this bride the Lord rebuke
[1:42:44] you Satan take your hands of the Gods
[1:42:48] property bias flatline he'll offspring
[1:42:54] with us it's the only thing that a
[1:43:04] defeat the devil
[1:43:08] that's what Jesus used the sort of the
[1:43:11] word oh you say what brother Tim I just
[1:43:16] want it you know I want this battle over
[1:43:18] well I do too but not till he's whipped
[1:43:23] I'm man so Jesus comes and he comes in
[1:43:26] one side and one in one way and tempts
[1:43:29] him in one way and the band and youth in
[1:43:31] you what's that but he finishes where he
[1:43:33] gets that battle done and he comes
[1:43:35] another way and then he comes another
[1:43:37] way but hallelujah after a while the
[1:43:44] devil leaveth him
[1:43:49] hallelujah just stand there you're gonna
[1:43:51] see his taillights Oh hallelujah I can
[1:43:54] see his taillights running out of this
[1:43:57] church this morning heading out the door
[1:43:59] hallelujah because the moment somebody
[1:44:02] believed and the Bible says and the
[1:44:11] angels came and strengthened them in the
[1:44:14] time for the angels just to come down
[1:44:16] among us it strengthened us after the
[1:44:19] battle hallelujah but they can prevail
[1:44:30] you can prevail just on the words of
[1:44:33] Jesus Jesus sent him out the seventy out
[1:44:38] in Luke 10 and verse 8 whatever city you
[1:44:42] entered and they receive you eight such
[1:44:44] things that are set before you and heal
[1:44:46] the sick that are darienne that means
[1:44:48] cast Satan out that's what healing the
[1:44:52] sick yes
[1:44:52] casting Satan out a man brother Brandon
[1:44:57] would preach the sermon casting out
[1:44:58] Devils is casting out unbelief and he
[1:45:02] said heal the sick that are terror
[1:45:03] Darian and say to them the kingdom of
[1:45:05] God is come near to you and verse 17
[1:45:10] after they went out the seventy returned
[1:45:13] again with joy saying Lord even the
[1:45:16] Devils are subject unto us through thy
[1:45:19] name hallelujah somebody ought to start
[1:45:24] shouting right there man the Devils are
[1:45:27] subject to us through thy name a man and
[1:45:32] he said unto them I beheld Satan as
[1:45:37] lightning flowers from heaven what you
[1:45:42] are out doing this I was watching what
[1:45:45] was happening in the heavens and you
[1:45:48] were making Satan's law because you were
[1:45:53] taking the position that I told you to
[1:45:56] take
[1:45:58] hallelujah amen tile you would take it
[1:46:01] the position I told you to take and that
[1:46:04] was class a turnout and you were acting
[1:46:08] that authority and you come back and you
[1:46:11] say it happened Lord and he said I saw
[1:46:13] it I saw what happened I was watching
[1:46:17] all the time and when you sort of
[1:46:19] believe it and you started using my name
[1:46:22] I saw Satan fall he didn't float down
[1:46:27] like a pretty little butterfly he fell
[1:46:29] like a stone from heaven hallelujah I
[1:46:34] want you to know you as a child of God
[1:46:36] can cast sitting down can see before
[1:46:41] your promise come on somebody cast him
[1:46:45] off your property you don't tell that
[1:46:48] devil where he belongs
[1:46:50] you don't belong in your position you're
[1:46:53] a son of God
[1:46:54] your daughter God you got her act on
[1:46:56] that if you don't act on his signal
[1:46:59] squat on it and he'll Bluff you although
[1:47:02] all your life now then he goes on and he
[1:47:09] says in verse 19 behold I give you power
[1:47:12] how many's one of his disciples this
[1:47:15] morning a man this is his commission to
[1:47:18] you I give you power to tread on
[1:47:21] serpents and scorpions and over some of
[1:47:25] the power well that's not what it said
[1:47:29] not just some all of the power of the
[1:47:34] enemy you know I want to point out
[1:47:36] something here you know when brother
[1:47:38] Branham was there before the angel and
[1:47:40] Andy you know he says he told me in one
[1:47:44] place he says he told me you know that
[1:47:46] nothing would stand before your prayers
[1:47:48] not even cancer but when he tells us
[1:47:51] originally with this you know and
[1:47:54] explaining it he said I said to him not
[1:47:59] even cancer because he said nothing to
[1:48:02] stand before your person he said not
[1:48:04] even cancer you see what in the angel
[1:48:07] making cancer some big thing
[1:48:10] it's only something that Devils only big
[1:48:13] in your eyes it's not big in the eyes of
[1:48:16] Jesus isn't him harder to heal than a
[1:48:19] toothache I meant no harder heal than a
[1:48:22] headache it's no harder to heal than
[1:48:25] than anything cancer is nothing in the
[1:48:28] presence of God are you with me and he
[1:48:32] said to humour me he said he I said to
[1:48:35] him not even cancer he said no not even
[1:48:38] cancer but to the angel he didn't make a
[1:48:41] difference and here he didn't say I give
[1:48:44] you power over some he said overall
[1:48:48] hallelujah he heals all diseases there
[1:48:53] is nothing too hard for the Lord there's
[1:48:57] nothing too great for God I give you
[1:49:03] power over the enemy and nothing shall
[1:49:07] by any means hurt you you're not going
[1:49:11] to come out damaged goods
[1:49:15] you're gonna come out victorious but not
[1:49:19] withstanding in this rejoice not the
[1:49:21] spirits are subject to you but rather
[1:49:23] rejoice because your names are written
[1:49:25] in heaven hallelujah hey man that's what
[1:49:31] we ought to be rejoicing in we've seen
[1:49:34] our name in the book we know who we are
[1:49:37] as sons of God rejoice that your sons
[1:49:41] and daughters of God now but I want to
[1:49:47] announce to you we've been talking about
[1:49:50] Satan and what happened there in the
[1:49:52] garden what happened in the heavens did
[1:49:55] the fall in the garden in his then him
[1:49:57] being able then to take Adams position
[1:49:59] as Prince of power the heir Jesus would
[1:50:02] call him the Prince of this world
[1:50:04] listen he is ruler of it because Adam
[1:50:08] subjected himself not by divine right
[1:50:12] and so it's questioned he's only a
[1:50:16] squatter and he's only there saying but
[1:50:19] I deceived them and they sold but jesus
[1:50:21] said but I
[1:50:22] paid for it I'm the Kinsmen now which
[1:50:27] one are you going to believe
[1:50:30] come on somebody which one are you going
[1:50:32] to believe are you gonna receive what
[1:50:34] the accuser says you're gonna receive
[1:50:36] what the Redeemer says paid in full by
[1:50:40] the blood of the lamb my sins are gone I
[1:50:42] stand as an abducted son I stand
[1:50:45] positioned as a child of God I Know Who
[1:50:48] I am but I want to get something to you
[1:50:52] we are not there at the very beginning
[1:50:55] there were the fall took place we are
[1:50:57] now past the Jewish dispensation and at
[1:51:01] the end of the Gentile dispensation so
[1:51:05] we are we are here we've seen the Old
[1:51:07] Testament fulfilled now we're in the
[1:51:10] fulfilling of the New Testament and
[1:51:12] we're standing exactly where the Jews
[1:51:15] was when Jesus came the first time and
[1:51:18] you as Gentiles are standing exactly
[1:51:21] where we're we're real where we are here
[1:51:24] to receive the Messiah and we've been
[1:51:27] brought back to a homeland for that
[1:51:31] purpose so we're on the other end of the
[1:51:34] situation we're on the cusp of full
[1:51:38] Redemption by the return of Jesus Christ
[1:51:42] and to do this Heaven's powers will be
[1:51:45] shaken and Satan will fall from his
[1:51:49] position of being able to stand before
[1:51:52] God as the accuser and will be cast down
[1:51:55] and when he's cast down we go up
[1:52:01] hallelujah I just wondered could this be
[1:52:05] the final day of battle
[1:52:07] we're that course we're that close man
[1:52:12] as we've been preaching the last night
[1:52:13] in Egypt I'm out here we are we're here
[1:52:17] at the last battle Luke chapter 21 verse
[1:52:23] 25 and there shall be signs in the Sun
[1:52:27] and in the moon and in the Stars and
[1:52:30] upon the earth distress of nations and
[1:52:33] with perplexity the sea and the waves
[1:52:36] roaring men's heart failing them for
[1:52:39] fear for the looking after those things
[1:52:42] which are coming on the earth for the
[1:52:44] powers of heaven shall be shaken and
[1:52:47] then once the powers of heaven is shaken
[1:52:51] Satan has cast down the bride goes up
[1:52:54] but then shall they see the Son of man
[1:52:56] coming in a cloud with power and great
[1:52:59] glory now now here's why that we can
[1:53:04] prevail we can prevail right now because
[1:53:08] of our intercessor and he's with me now
[1:53:12] when Jesus ascended he went into the
[1:53:16] third heavens everybody say it
[1:53:18] third heavens now if you get it if we
[1:53:23] would look at it in the in the natural
[1:53:25] you know all your types Father Son and
[1:53:27] Holy Ghost God meant three different
[1:53:31] manifestations same God we see man
[1:53:34] bodies spirit and soul it's a one man
[1:53:37] and and and he himself is a tabernacle
[1:53:41] the outer court to enter court in the
[1:53:43] most holy the Old Testament the same way
[1:53:47] that the tabernacle outer court inner
[1:53:50] court must holy and so when you get to
[1:53:53] heaven there is a place in the heavens
[1:53:56] called the sanctuary this is called the
[1:54:00] third heaven I'm going to get to this
[1:54:04] for a moment as we look at it because I
[1:54:07] want you to understand he's when in the
[1:54:09] pred the presence of God is this spoke
[1:54:12] up in the book of Revelation as the
[1:54:14] temple of God where the throne is the
[1:54:17] presence of God no we we was dealing
[1:54:20] with
[1:54:20] the other day of the vials that when the
[1:54:24] the angel was given permission to pour
[1:54:27] out his vials of judgment on the earth
[1:54:29] for the tribulation of the tribulation
[1:54:31] judgments began of the wrath of the Lamb
[1:54:33] the sanctuary becomes smoky and that is
[1:54:36] because Jesus has left the sanctuary and
[1:54:40] when he does as we know he's going to
[1:54:43] come first to the Saints who are looking
[1:54:46] for him
[1:54:47] those who are waiting there beyond the
[1:54:50] curtain of time who have entered in
[1:54:52] through the veil of death into that
[1:54:54] round but let's just look right now in
[1:54:57] high Hebrews 9 24 where that word that
[1:55:01] he says that Christ is not entered into
[1:55:05] the holy place made with hands which are
[1:55:08] the figures of the truth and these were
[1:55:10] just tights just speaking of what or
[1:55:13] what are the true would be but he's
[1:55:15] entered into heaven itself to appear in
[1:55:20] the presence of God for us now I want
[1:55:25] you to understand this is so that when
[1:55:27] Satan comes to accuse we have an
[1:55:31] advocate there and he will accuse until
[1:55:35] every name that is on the book has been
[1:55:39] manifested on earth and dipped in blood
[1:55:42] all right now so when Satan comes to
[1:55:47] accuse we have an advocate there we have
[1:55:50] a go-between now this is a Apostolic
[1:55:54] doctrine because now he's in the
[1:55:56] presence of God he'd appear and they're
[1:55:58] in the presence of God what's the word
[1:56:00] for us I want you to get the picture
[1:56:03] he's there for me he's there for you
[1:56:06] there's a reason he's there
[1:56:09] did you need him and here's what you
[1:56:13] need first John two and one my little
[1:56:16] children these things I write unto you
[1:56:18] that you send not and if any man sin we
[1:56:23] have an advocate with the father Jesus
[1:56:25] Christ the righteous
[1:56:27] hallelujah I'm at now this word advocate
[1:56:31] is the word comforter are you with me
[1:56:35] same word when Jesus said I will not
[1:56:38] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[1:56:39] that's an advocate I will be your
[1:56:41] advocate advocate I am going away to be
[1:56:46] to make an approach of God for God to
[1:56:49] God because man has not been able to
[1:56:51] approach God and even the Old Testament
[1:56:55] Saints could not come in this presence
[1:56:56] they had to wait down in Paradise but
[1:56:59] I'm going there as a man to represent
[1:57:02] the whole human race so that when you
[1:57:05] have a need I know how you feel I'm a
[1:57:10] proper mediator I went through
[1:57:12] everything you went through so I can
[1:57:15] plead your case amen now so he says my
[1:57:21] little children I write into you that
[1:57:23] you sent not because we're not to be
[1:57:27] willful sinners but if any man sin we
[1:57:31] have an advocate with the father we have
[1:57:35] an approach to God we have somebody that
[1:57:39] will plead our case a man not some
[1:57:44] unknown distant spirit that never was a
[1:57:47] man but someone who was flesh and bones
[1:57:50] like we are who knows what it is to be
[1:57:53] sick brother tell me you know I'm not
[1:57:58] sure about him sitting down a rock and
[1:58:00] groaning with a headache that's what
[1:58:01] Ingram said and brother branham's just
[1:58:03] quoted that well let me tell you if you
[1:58:05] don't think he had a headache what about
[1:58:08] when he was that thrust her crown of
[1:58:10] thorns on his head and beat him over the
[1:58:13] head with a reed and then beat him and
[1:58:16] beat him and beat him up on his back you
[1:58:19] don't think he had a pain he groaned
[1:58:25] with a headache he groaned under the
[1:58:28] every listen
[1:58:30] he was marred by him the worse than any
[1:58:33] man are you with me everything you went
[1:58:39] through
[1:58:40] you said my pains and my feet he had
[1:58:42] painted as his feet pain in my head he's
[1:58:47] had pain in his head pain in my shoulder
[1:58:50] my back brother Tim I can't really sit
[1:58:52] here he's had that pain he knows how you
[1:58:56] feel he knows how it is to be weak he
[1:59:01] knows how he is to be hungry he knows
[1:59:06] how it is to be falsely accused he knows
[1:59:10] how it is like a woman at the well
[1:59:12] didn't want to give him a water because
[1:59:14] of his race
[1:59:15] he knows how and he needs me he had
[1:59:18] racial prejudice come on every kind of
[1:59:24] thing that can be thrown at him he was
[1:59:26] called an illegitimate he was made from
[1:59:28] all the religious leaders rejected him
[1:59:31] everything in every way you cannot name
[1:59:34] a problem that he don't understand oh he
[1:59:46] would look at him come and said Isaiah
[1:59:48] that seemed he was wounded for my
[1:59:51] transgressions not for his own my
[1:59:54] transgressions he was bruised because of
[1:59:58] my iniquities the weapons I should have
[2:00:01] got the chastisement of my peace he took
[2:00:04] my weapons and by His stripes I am
[2:00:10] delivered killed saved and he is the
[2:00:22] perpetuation that means the means of
[2:00:26] appeasement going back to Egypt for a
[2:00:31] moment every Israeli was to die but a
[2:00:36] lamb took his place somebody help me all
[2:00:40] the firstborn was to die but a lamb took
[2:00:43] their place everybody was guilty but a
[2:00:48] lamb took their place
[2:00:50] and the death that was should have come
[2:00:53] on the firstborn was put up on the lam
[2:00:55] I'm an the same thing
[2:00:58] he became the perpetuation the lamb
[2:01:00] would become the perpetuation or the
[2:01:04] appeasement the wrath was poured out
[2:01:06] upon that God said today you eat thereof
[2:01:10] that day you die he can't change his
[2:01:11] mind so the penalty has to be paid and
[2:01:16] so Jesus takes the penalty and he says
[2:01:21] and he is a perpetuation for our sins
[2:01:23] and not for ours only but for the sins
[2:01:27] of the whole world what a mighty God
[2:01:32] what a gracious Savior amen
[2:01:35] now so you see here's a teaser of our
[2:01:39] sins but now we're here's Jesus now I
[2:01:44] know a background now for over an hour
[2:01:47] and we talked about were Satan this and
[2:01:50] how he got there and the battle that's
[2:01:52] going on and he's going to be cast down
[2:01:53] and then we're going up because we're
[2:01:56] going to take our position of sonship
[2:02:01] this world will come back under the
[2:02:03] Dominion of man with Jesus being the
[2:02:06] king of it and thus ruling and reigning
[2:02:08] with him I can read it to you in the
[2:02:09] Bible we shall we shall rule and reign
[2:02:13] or we shall be kings and priests and
[2:02:15] rule and reign with him upon the earth
[2:02:18] but where is Jesus now I can hear it in
[2:02:25] the hearts brother the heart of brother
[2:02:27] Branham I hear to the heart of saints oh
[2:02:30] I want to see him it's the cry of the
[2:02:33] sunrider's there's a cry of ever true
[2:02:37] believer certainly I'm in love with his
[2:02:42] word are you in love with his word how
[2:02:45] many's grateful that the the seals have
[2:02:48] been revealed all of them all seven
[2:02:50] seals how many's grateful that the word
[2:02:53] has been made known in this day and we
[2:02:56] have restored back to Apostles doctrine
[2:02:59] how many's happy for that
[2:03:01] hey man I'm in love with his word and I
[2:03:04] love you I love his love letter it's
[2:03:09] kind of like getting the letter from
[2:03:11] somebody far away I might and you get a
[2:03:14] message from somewhere a loved one far
[2:03:19] away it's not them
[2:03:21] oh but you love it
[2:03:24] you'd love to get that letter you know
[2:03:28] it's like the soldier boys hearing from
[2:03:30] home they can get the hug mom or dad but
[2:03:33] tears from them they got a letter from
[2:03:36] them and they would read between the
[2:03:38] lines of it and they would Bastion they
[2:03:40] would think envision what mom and dad's
[2:03:42] doing back home and you know all of this
[2:03:45] is they conveyed their love but it
[2:03:48] wasn't them I just want to say I love
[2:03:52] the Bible it's a love letter and yet its
[2:03:59] expression of Jesus but it's not Jesus a
[2:04:05] bask in his message his expression of
[2:04:10] him it's not him you say all of the
[2:04:16] words him by the damn word don't let me
[2:04:18] tell you it's an expression of a person
[2:04:22] and this is expression of a person and
[2:04:27] yeah it's the same as him in the sense
[2:04:29] that what he said did this is what he
[2:04:32] said and it's true but it's not him I
[2:04:36] want to see Jesus I want to see the one
[2:04:43] who died for me I want to see the one
[2:04:47] who is nail-scarred for me and I want to
[2:04:51] see him not not just get a letter from
[2:04:55] him or receive a message from him I'm
[2:04:58] grateful for the message he'll give me a
[2:05:00] misunderstood but he's not the same as
[2:05:03] him
[2:05:07] I'm basking it I want to see Jesus this
[2:05:12] is brother Branham if you don't believe
[2:05:13] it
[2:05:14] brother Branham had received many many
[2:05:16] things and when he went beyond the
[2:05:18] curtain of time was when he actually
[2:05:20] went there was after he drew his last
[2:05:21] breath here he stepped over in that
[2:05:23] dimension and his heart's cry was I want
[2:05:28] to see Jesus no matter how much of the
[2:05:34] word that we've seen how much of the
[2:05:37] message we've seen I want to see Jesus
[2:05:41] how who we saw him you know you know
[2:05:44] yeah it was like the wind that blew and
[2:05:48] there as it blew the winds and the
[2:05:51] leaves on the trees moved as the winds
[2:05:53] of the Holy Spirit moved blind eyes was
[2:05:56] open we saw Jesus it had to be Jesus it
[2:05:59] had to be him passing by for blind eyes
[2:06:02] open and the Deaf to hear the seals took
[2:06:05] him open it was him a member but we want
[2:06:10] to see sees us and we're generation of
[2:06:17] people we're gonna get to see him where
[2:06:27] is he now fundamental doctrine of the
[2:06:30] New Testament is it Jesus ascended
[2:06:33] leaving the earth to go into the seventh
[2:06:36] dimension Paul called it the third
[2:06:39] heaven heaven sanctuary we would you you
[2:06:44] would be referred to in the type of the
[2:06:47] of the Old Testament Tabernacle the
[2:06:50] holiest of Holies the highest of the
[2:06:53] heavens and Jesus has entered into
[2:06:57] heaven sanctuary for us to the very
[2:07:03] throne of God and he remains there until
[2:07:06] this day how old my brother Tim he came
[2:07:11] down in Revelation 10 he also did and
[2:07:14] in other other places in the Bible
[2:07:17] that's where he spiritually came he came
[2:07:19] into the Holy Ghost on the day of
[2:07:21] Pentecost a man that this again was a it
[2:07:25] was not a physical comment and we're
[2:07:27] talking about the physical return of the
[2:07:29] Lord Jesus Christ we're not talking
[2:07:33] about a spiritual and anointing or power
[2:07:36] and enlightenment or revelation we're
[2:07:40] talking about him he entered into
[2:07:50] sanctuary heaven sanctuary he remains
[2:07:53] there to this day
[2:07:54] this is Paul's teaching this is Peters
[2:07:58] teaching this is a this is a pasta liqu
[2:08:02] doctrine this was William branham's
[2:08:07] teaching before the seals and after the
[2:08:11] seals that Jesus is there in the century
[2:08:16] as the atonement as a mediator between
[2:08:21] us and God until our last human battle
[2:08:27] is over somebody with me so will brother
[2:08:33] Jim we we've been declared righteous and
[2:08:35] we're justified and we never did it in
[2:08:38] the first place yes that's what's been
[2:08:40] declared but I'm still here
[2:08:41] fighting another battle and until the
[2:08:45] last human battle is fought and when I
[2:08:48] need him there to make inappropes for me
[2:08:54] cuz I cannot approach that throne
[2:08:57] without him and as long as I'm in this
[2:09:03] mortal body
[2:09:04] no man can go into his presence he has
[2:09:09] to be changed first and until our change
[2:09:11] comes he remains there in heaven
[2:09:15] sanctuary mark 16 verse 19 and then the
[2:09:21] Lord had a spoken to them and he was
[2:09:24] received up to heaven into heaven and
[2:09:27] on the right hand of God I don't know if
[2:09:31] I can finish all this today but I want
[2:09:34] you to just to get this he didn't just
[2:09:36] go to the lower heavens he went to the
[2:09:39] highest part of heaven and he saddled
[2:09:43] the right hand of God now we'll get to
[2:09:47] that here in a moment but let's just go
[2:09:48] to Hebrews 7:26 and let's read it for
[2:09:51] such a high priest became us he's saying
[2:09:56] he became the high priest in other words
[2:10:00] he became our intercessor he became the
[2:10:03] one that brought the blood to atone
[2:10:06] and it wasn't animal blood it was his
[2:10:08] own blood such a high priest became us
[2:10:13] who is holy harmless undefiled separate
[2:10:17] from sinners and made higher than the
[2:10:22] heavens a man so you see he's so high in
[2:10:27] the heavens from that position he looks
[2:10:30] down on all of heaven right down to
[2:10:34] earth
[2:10:34] hey man brother Branham would tell us
[2:10:37] and be not afraid in 1963 he says he was
[2:10:41] talking about how that Jesus wouldn't
[2:10:43] climb to high heel what's his disciples
[2:10:45] leave and he says but he hadn't really
[2:10:48] left him you know the Bible said he
[2:10:49] climb on the highest heels there was in
[2:10:52] the country so he could watch him and
[2:10:53] that's when he did when he left us at
[2:10:56] Calvary when they crucified him he never
[2:11:00] left us he didn't climb the eyes heal
[2:11:02] but he climbed Calvary he kept on
[2:11:05] climbing past the moon to Stars plumb
[2:11:08] him to the heavens of heavens higher UK
[2:11:10] higher you go further you can see he got
[2:11:13] so high till he has to look down on
[2:11:16] heaven the Bible said yeah he's way up
[2:11:18] in the heavens of heavens I'll send it
[2:11:20] on high no this is what brother Branham
[2:11:24] said he kept climbing and he's there
[2:11:27] this is what he did for us when he left
[2:11:30] Calvary when he ascended he climbed in
[2:11:34] the highest of heavens so he could see
[2:11:36] it every bet there's an eye watching you
[2:11:40] he sees every situation he understands
[2:11:44] what the enemy's been doing from his
[2:11:47] position he can see the works of the
[2:11:50] enemy and knows exactly how to commander
[2:11:52] his troops on earth to go defeat him are
[2:11:56] you with me
[2:11:56] I mean someone or two said he will
[2:11:59] regard to prayer of the destitute this
[2:12:01] is verse 17 sums 102 17 he will regard
[2:12:05] the prayer of the destitute and not
[2:12:07] despise a prayer this shall be written
[2:12:09] for the generation to come and the
[2:12:11] people which shall be created shall
[2:12:14] praise the Lord for he had looked down
[2:12:16] from the height of his sanctuary from
[2:12:19] heaven did the Lord behold the earth to
[2:12:22] hear the groaning of the prisoner to
[2:12:25] lose those that were appointed to death
[2:12:28] and to declare the name of the Lord in
[2:12:30] science and his praise in Jerusalem
[2:12:34] hallelujah that's why he's there are you
[2:12:36] with me to hear the groaning to hear
[2:12:40] your travail are you with me and to
[2:12:43] loose those that were appointed to death
[2:12:46] [Music]
[2:12:47] I said hallelujah this is why he's there
[2:12:51] he's watching for you
[2:12:53] his eyes are on you this morning and
[2:12:56] those that were appointed for death he
[2:12:58] has loosed hallelujah he hears the
[2:13:03] groaning of the prisoner he hears what
[2:13:06] the devil has done to his children
[2:13:09] you've been in bondage of sin and
[2:13:11] bondage of wickedness and bondage of
[2:13:14] drugs and alcohol and women and men or
[2:13:17] whatever it is have you been under
[2:13:19] bondage and upon into death
[2:13:21] but he sees and he sees it to loose you
[2:13:25] Oh hallelujah
[2:13:28] I want to get it to you he's also
[2:13:30] watching for your children your loved
[2:13:33] ones for the loss that is out there he
[2:13:36] sees so he can't so cry he hears your
[2:13:40] cry
[2:13:41] we use a prayer to pray because every
[2:13:45] time you call and is there to loose -
[2:13:49] loose the priest Oh hallelujah
[2:13:52] all the angel may appear to your loved
[2:13:55] one right today and shake them and bring
[2:13:58] them and right into his presence but
[2:14:01] they could come to themselves and
[2:14:03] recognize the father that they have left
[2:14:07] because he's watching and nothing misses
[2:14:11] his eyes hallelujah hallelujah
[2:14:16] nothing misses his eyes he's got eyes
[2:14:19] before and behind a man he sees every
[2:14:22] move up on the earth
[2:14:24] he knows what the devil is doing he
[2:14:26] knows about that sickness in your body
[2:14:28] he knows he knows about your brother
[2:14:49] branham would say as we finish that
[2:14:51] quote his eye is on the sparrow and I
[2:14:55] know he's watching us tonight that's
[2:14:57] right he's looking down upon this
[2:14:59] meeting he sees our trouble he knows our
[2:15:02] frustrations and frustrations he knows
[2:15:05] how sick you are he knows what you've
[2:15:08] been through
[2:15:08] he knows what you're trying to do his
[2:15:11] eye is watching you he's that fair
[2:15:13] they're not watching not to condemn you
[2:15:19] but to loose you
[2:15:22] not to destroy you but to free you
[2:15:26] let bring you out of bondage to bring
[2:15:29] healing to break deliverance now Paul
[2:15:36] spoke about the third heaven first
[2:15:39] Corinthians 12 and 1 it's not expedient
[2:15:43] for me doubtless to glory I will come to
[2:15:46] visions and revelations of the Lord I
[2:15:49] knew a man in Christ above fourteen
[2:15:54] years ago whether in the body or I
[2:15:56] cannot tell or whether out of the body I
[2:15:59] cannot tell God knoweth such a one was
[2:16:04] caught up into the third heavens now
[2:16:09] heaven is not marked off in different
[2:16:12] levels that we attain to by works there
[2:16:19] is brother Branham said when he went
[2:16:22] into that realm of paradise where the
[2:16:27] Saints are waiting the New Testament
[2:16:29] Saints Old Testaments already risen so
[2:16:32] well just some of them well some of them
[2:16:34] because some of them they thought were
[2:16:37] Saints and weren't Saints but you know
[2:16:41] the blood did not leave a one there in
[2:16:43] Paradise the empty paradise paradise is
[2:16:48] empty so all of them raised are you with
[2:16:52] me now let's get this let's get this
[2:16:55] clear but there is a place called
[2:16:57] paradise and it's under the altar of God
[2:17:01] and the altar God is the third realm of
[2:17:05] heaven it is the throne of God it is the
[2:17:10] seat of mercy now just below that and in
[2:17:17] the in the levels of heaven is angels
[2:17:20] and below that brother brems said I went
[2:17:24] to the first heaven which is the realm
[2:17:29] of paradise and there's where the saints
[2:17:33] are waiting
[2:17:34] now friends this is no imagination
[2:17:37] they're really there now there are three
[2:17:45] heavens but there are seven dimensions
[2:17:48] now not seven dimensions of heaven -
[2:17:51] seven dimensions to explain a dimension
[2:17:54] a dimension literally means length
[2:17:57] breadth and height so the dimensions of
[2:17:59] this Polpette is you know so many feet
[2:18:02] high and so many feet wide and so many
[2:18:04] feet deep
[2:18:05] that's the dimensions the dimensions of
[2:18:08] where we live is like matter in time we
[2:18:11] live in those that's you know we can't
[2:18:14] go no further than time in this
[2:18:15] dimension and we can't leave matter
[2:18:19] right and and so you know we are
[2:18:23] controlled by the light of the Sun here
[2:18:25] upon this earth all energy and life
[2:18:29] comes from the Sun that's the Lincoln
[2:18:32] Heights and the breadth of where we live
[2:18:34] now is three dimensions science has
[2:18:39] brought us into an invisible dimension
[2:18:41] and that invisible unseen dimension is
[2:18:46] very real now a hundred years ago they
[2:18:50] really didn't know much about it in fact
[2:18:52] they didn't know it even hardly existed
[2:18:55] let's just see we've made a little more
[2:18:57] time so let's go back 150 years ago they
[2:19:00] didn't know anything about this
[2:19:01] dimension but it was real it was there
[2:19:04] all the time
[2:19:05] television was there back when when
[2:19:08] Jesus was here that's right they just
[2:19:11] didn't have the way to produce it
[2:19:14] electricity was here back then that it
[2:19:19] just didn't know how to tap into it it's
[2:19:22] an unseen force that we operate by we're
[2:19:26] sitting here in this building and and
[2:19:29] even if you're listening in through the
[2:19:31] internet you're hearing my voice come
[2:19:33] through the microphone go into a system
[2:19:36] go out in through the lines go out into
[2:19:39] into the the big banks
[2:19:43] and and fed out where however it works I
[2:19:46] don't have to know how it works I just
[2:19:49] know it works television television is
[2:19:54] there you know people that were here
[2:19:57] fifty years ago can all of a sudden be
[2:20:00] in this room right now by television
[2:20:02] moving talking whatever else and they're
[2:20:06] dead been dead 50 years because
[2:20:09] television can produce that where it
[2:20:11] appears right in front of you
[2:20:12] right you tell of your telephone you
[2:20:16] know you can stand right here
[2:20:18] we can call Africa or Asia or anywhere
[2:20:21] else and and you know it just goes into
[2:20:25] an invisible farm moves out goes out
[2:20:30] your whole picture your everything you
[2:20:32] movements everything because we the
[2:20:35] fourth dimension has been brought very
[2:20:37] real to us now that's what science has
[2:20:42] had had been been able to do but now the
[2:20:46] fifth dimension is the dimension of the
[2:20:48] lost the dimension of lost souls and
[2:20:52] demons so it's where that they dwell
[2:20:56] it's a real dimension and let me just
[2:20:59] tell you it's a round that you will go
[2:21:01] to if you die without accepting the
[2:21:04] pardon that's made available by the
[2:21:07] blood of Christ a mouth that's where you
[2:21:11] go if you go without receiving that
[2:21:14] pardon and forgiveness of sin you go
[2:21:16] into the fifth dimension there were the
[2:21:20] the realm of the Lost and it's a
[2:21:23] horrible condition dimension brother
[2:21:27] branham said is a condition it's um he
[2:21:30] said it's like going to sleep you can't
[2:21:33] be asleep you're in a nightmare you're
[2:21:35] hideous things your your dream your
[2:21:37] screaming you said that's the state of
[2:21:40] the wicked dead you can't go in the
[2:21:41] presence of God in other words you can't
[2:21:44] wake up and go into God's presence
[2:21:46] because you're sinner and you can't come
[2:21:49] back to the earth because your time is
[2:21:52] up on the earth and so you're caught in
[2:21:54] between there
[2:21:56] in between the earth but between this
[2:22:00] dimension of life matter and time and
[2:22:02] between the realms of heaven you can't
[2:22:04] go into heaven and you're there a
[2:22:06] wandering spirit you're an atonement and
[2:22:13] like a tormented nightmare but it's real
[2:22:16] is not a nightmare problem is you'll
[2:22:20] never wake up out of the nightmare
[2:22:22] the nightmare get worse because what you
[2:22:28] knew is you'll wind up in the great
[2:22:30] white throne judgment and brother
[2:22:35] Branham would say he would describe the
[2:22:36] white throne like this he said let my
[2:22:39] belly be opened and cut open and he said
[2:22:42] let sulfur be burn in it and all kinds
[2:22:45] of horrible things dude done to me but
[2:22:47] don't let me stand at that white throne
[2:22:50] judgment that's of it dimension it's not
[2:22:58] heaven it's just a dimension beyond
[2:23:04] light matter in time
[2:23:07] now there's another dimension and it's
[2:23:11] called the six dimension the six
[2:23:14] dimension is under the altar where Jesus
[2:23:17] is and that's where the saints abide and
[2:23:21] in contrast is not a dream it's real but
[2:23:27] in contrast to a lie a nightmare is like
[2:23:30] a wonderful dream that you'll never wake
[2:23:33] up from are you with me and then you'll
[2:23:38] never you'll never wake up you'll never
[2:23:41] go back to the old life again
[2:23:44] you'll never are you with me you'll
[2:23:47] never be mortal again
[2:23:49] you'll always be immortal timeless
[2:23:52] eternal not controlled by matter or even
[2:23:56] sunlight but controlled by and energized
[2:24:00] by the very light of God are you with me
[2:24:04] so it's like a wonderful dream that you
[2:24:06] never want to wake up from but it's not
[2:24:08] a dream it's real now the seventh
[2:24:13] dimension that's a sixth dimension where
[2:24:17] the Saints are and the seventh dimension
[2:24:19] is the altar where God dwells now we can
[2:24:24] see from these souls under the altar I
[2:24:26] just like to go there for a moment
[2:24:28] and I'll try to conclude with this part
[2:24:32] of the thought souls of the altar let's
[2:24:35] go to the fifth seal we're just going to
[2:24:37] see these are in the martyrs block is
[2:24:40] what brother Branham called it they're
[2:24:42] in a special designated place they were
[2:24:45] Jewish people who will be given white
[2:24:48] robes and he said they did it because
[2:24:52] the testimony which they held will read
[2:24:54] this in a moment in revelation 6 and 9
[2:24:57] actually we'll just go there now but
[2:24:59] these are souls in the altar and brother
[2:25:01] Branham said that my group the believers
[2:25:04] for this age were not in the martyrs
[2:25:06] book they were they were here gathered
[2:25:10] still in the sixth dimension souls under
[2:25:14] the altar so he said there are there
[2:25:17] groups like that are gathered like the
[2:25:19] these Jews that that had that were were
[2:25:23] given grace and he said they were under
[2:25:26] the martyrs block haven't been slain for
[2:25:30] the word of God and the testimony which
[2:25:31] they held but he said my group was not
[2:25:34] with them they were here I still under
[2:25:37] the altar waiting for Jesus to come are
[2:25:41] you with me now
[2:25:42] so revelation six and nine when he had
[2:25:45] opened the fifth seal I saw under the
[2:25:47] altar the souls of them that were slain
[2:25:49] for the word of God and for the
[2:25:51] testimony which they held so these were
[2:25:54] not
[2:25:55] since these were Jewish people who were
[2:25:58] given white robes and they they were
[2:26:02] slain because of their stand for the
[2:26:06] word of God the Old Testament law and
[2:26:09] for the testimony that the hell this is
[2:26:12] why they were killed they were killed
[2:26:14] because they were Jews are you with me
[2:26:18] and they were despised because they were
[2:26:20] Jews they were God's people God's chosen
[2:26:23] people and God hadn't forgot them a man
[2:26:31] if God wouldn't forget Jews
[2:26:34] are you with me God wouldn't forget Jews
[2:26:37] who did not receive the atoning blood of
[2:26:39] Christ and he would not forget them but
[2:26:42] remembered them because of their
[2:26:44] testimony in the Word of God then prints
[2:26:46] we got really dis God don't forget
[2:26:49] nothing
[2:26:51] he's not gonna forget about you your
[2:26:55] loved ones your children your knees
[2:26:58] what's now and they cried with a loud
[2:27:01] voice saying how long O Lord holy and
[2:27:05] true dost thou not judge and avenge our
[2:27:07] blood on them that dwell on the earth
[2:27:09] and white robes were given to them every
[2:27:12] one of them and it was said unto them
[2:27:14] that they should rest yet a little
[2:27:16] season until their fellow-servants also
[2:27:18] and their brethren should be killed as
[2:27:20] they were and should be fulfilled so
[2:27:23] there's going to be a few more added and
[2:27:26] that's gonna be killed she tells us of
[2:27:31] these souls in the altar they're slain
[2:27:33] for the word of God now we're just going
[2:27:35] to make some points here as we go along
[2:27:38] that these were not disembodied spirits
[2:27:41] but there were people that were yet
[2:27:43] alive even though they had been martyred
[2:27:47] they are not different people but people
[2:27:50] relocated understand whatever you are
[2:27:56] here that's what you're going to be
[2:27:57] there you know go me I did not gonna be
[2:28:01] you're gonna be the same person just
[2:28:03] relocated
[2:28:05] somebody with me that's what brother
[2:28:07] Benton said if your center here you been
[2:28:09] sitting there so don't worry you won't
[2:28:11] be there if you're lying here you'll be
[2:28:13] lying there dead so don't worry you'll
[2:28:15] be over here in this other round
[2:28:17] whatever you was that's what you'll be
[2:28:20] unless there's a atoning blood that
[2:28:23] wipes out every memory of sin now watch
[2:28:29] this real close so they were relocated
[2:28:33] those dead in Christ they're still just
[2:28:35] alive as they were when they walked back
[2:28:39] can I say they're more alive not just as
[2:28:45] a lot they are more alive there than
[2:28:49] what they were here this is real life
[2:28:56] and he say you know they're there
[2:28:59] they're just been relocated and waiting
[2:29:04] for Jesus to come you see that run out
[2:29:07] of the the link Heights and breadth of
[2:29:10] this dimension they run out of time so
[2:29:13] they move our relocated out of this old
[2:29:18] time-worn body into a theophany party
[2:29:24] mmm because the Bible said if this house
[2:29:27] of our habitation be dissolved we have
[2:29:30] one of waiting already in the heavens
[2:29:36] hallelujah I've got a body that's better
[2:29:39] than this one and I'm gonna get to it
[2:29:42] one way or the other
[2:29:43] I go by the way of the grave I'll just
[2:29:46] be relocated if I go by there change I'm
[2:29:49] just going to be relocated but whatever
[2:29:51] I'm moving into that theophany so are
[2:29:55] you now they're not different people the
[2:30:03] boogie brew speaks of it as as righteous
[2:30:07] men made perfect so you know here we are
[2:30:12] we're still in imperfect bodies but when
[2:30:16] we step over there just one breath
[2:30:18] from here we're righteous men made
[2:30:19] perfect these persons were remembered in
[2:30:26] heaven because of their life on the
[2:30:27] earth God doesn't forget you're
[2:30:29] remembered for your deeds because of the
[2:30:31] testimony which they held their called
[2:30:35] out with a loud voice or they called out
[2:30:38] they spoke with a loud voice so they can
[2:30:40] express themselves as like people on the
[2:30:42] earth this tells us they were rational
[2:30:46] they were communicative they were
[2:30:47] emotional they were passionate they had
[2:30:50] ever ever spectrum of feeling as brother
[2:30:55] Branham when he when I went beyond the
[2:30:56] car when he went beyond the curtain of
[2:30:58] time he says you you mean I can feel
[2:31:00] them you mean they're real in other
[2:31:02] words they're not they're not just the
[2:31:04] spirit or a spook but it's a body that
[2:31:08] can be touched
[2:31:09] they were fully conscious they were
[2:31:13] aware of each other they were aware of
[2:31:15] God they're aware of the situation on
[2:31:18] the earth and they were even praying
[2:31:21] they were free to ask God questions they
[2:31:25] talked to God to intervene on the earth
[2:31:27] and forgot to act on their behalf it
[2:31:30] means they had an audience with God in
[2:31:33] the present heavens they knew enough
[2:31:35] about what was happening on the earth
[2:31:37] they realized there was those had killed
[2:31:41] them and had not been judged they had a
[2:31:45] clear memory of their life on the earth
[2:31:47] they knew they had been killed they had
[2:31:49] prayed for judgment of their persecutors
[2:31:51] who are still hurting others and asking
[2:31:54] for divine intervention they were an
[2:31:56] effect interceding for the suffering of
[2:31:58] others on the earth are you with me
[2:32:02] there were continent of God's attributes
[2:32:05] as they called him lord holy and truth
[2:32:10] they were treated as individuals as each
[2:32:13] one was given white robes they had
[2:32:17] physical forms because as a spirit they
[2:32:19] could not have been clothed with a white
[2:32:21] robe God answered them and promised
[2:32:24] fulfill their requests but that they
[2:32:27] would have to wait a little longer
[2:32:30] brother branham went beyond the curtain
[2:32:32] of time I said but we gotta wait a
[2:32:35] little longer he hasn't come yet but
[2:32:40] he'll come to you and when he comes
[2:32:43] you'll be judged for what you preach to
[2:32:45] us and if you are accepted which you
[2:32:49] will be we'll go back to earth together
[2:32:54] come on somebody the Saints anticipate
[2:32:58] the return of Jesus and they've made
[2:33:01] their immediate return to Earth for with
[2:33:03] excitement they said to brother Branham
[2:33:04] one day we're going back to earth and
[2:33:08] we'll take up our bodies again we don't
[2:33:11] eat here but we'll eat there and those
[2:33:15] bodies it's somebody with me a man you
[2:33:19] see the Saints I want you to get it the
[2:33:21] Saints are anticipating the coming of
[2:33:25] the Lord so if they are anticipated how
[2:33:29] much more should we be if they are
[2:33:34] saying he's still higher that means he
[2:33:37] had descended from the mercy seat yet
[2:33:40] but when he does he'll come to them
[2:33:43] first and then there'll be a
[2:33:44] resurrection and then we'll gather
[2:33:47] together hallelujah are you with me
[2:33:53] we'll gather together hey man I'm just
[2:33:56] gonna jump ahead of my time right now
[2:33:58] and just conclude it with this it was
[2:34:00] brother Branham would we would say well
[2:34:03] you would say he said you know when when
[2:34:05] he said God look at his wisdom his
[2:34:09] wisdom he he knows he knows when the
[2:34:12] dead in Christ rise and here we are all
[2:34:15] getting together we're gonna look around

[2:45:58] the Bible said that the heavens rejoice
[2:46:00] and we usually say the Angels rejoice
[2:46:03] but the Bible cendars add there's
[2:46:05] rejoicing before the angels before the
[2:46:09] presence of God
[2:46:10] there's rejoicing for ever sinner that
[2:46:13] repents
