[47:53] year father we ask that you would come
[47:55] and have preeminence in this building

[48:00] member in this assembly tonight father
[48:02] the visitors in our midst I pray Lord

[48:08] a supernatural effect on their life
[48:10] tonight oh God I pray that everyone that

[48:58] sure thank you for the opportunity for
[49:00] the Tim it's such
[49:02] a personally you've been a great
[49:03] privilege to my family and your ministry
[49:05] and
[49:06] we just thank God that there's still men
[49:09] that'll fight for the message amen
[49:11] if you have your Bible to turn in the
[49:12] book of Colossians the second chapter
[49:17] in the first verse
[49:22] for I would that ye knew what great
[49:24] conflict I have for you and for them at
[49:27] laodicea and for as many as have not
[49:30] seen my face in the flesh that their
[49:32] hearts might be comforted being knit
[49:34] together in love and unto all Riches of
[49:36] the full Assurance of understanding to
[49:38] the acknowledgment of the mystery of God
[49:40] and of the father and of Christ in whom
[49:43] are hit all the treasures of wisdom and
[49:45] knowledge and this I say lest any man
[49:47] should beguile you with enticing words
[49:51] for though I'd be absent in the flesh
[49:52] yet am I with you in the spirit joying
[49:55] and beholding your order and the
[49:57] steadfastness of your faith in Christ as
[50:00] ye have therefore received Christ Jesus
[50:02] the Lord so walk ye in him rooted and
[50:05] built up in him and established in the
[50:07] faith as ye have been taught abounding
[50:09] therein with Thanksgiving beware lest
[50:11] any man spoil you through philosophy and
[50:13] vain to seed after the tradition of men
[50:15] after the rudiments of the world and not
[50:18] after Christ for in him dwelleth all the
[50:21] fullness of the godhead bodily and ye
[50:24] are complete in him which is the head of
[50:26] all principality and power amen may God
[50:29] bless his word tonight uh just for our
[50:32] time here tonight you may be seated we
[50:35] want to talk about ye are complete
[50:38] in him amen I I know this is our last
[50:41] service of the year and uh we probably
[50:43] didn't start out the year thinking you
[50:44] were going to hear me for your last
[50:45] service but here we are
[50:48] but I believe God has it in order amen I
[50:51] believe all the trials that we went
[50:52] through to this last year and all the
[50:54] disappointments and all the all the
[50:57] turns that we didn't see coming and all
[50:59] the what we might have thought were
[51:00] mistakes or pitfalls I believe God
[51:03] ordered those I believe our footsteps
[51:06] are ordered of the Lord and it's not
[51:07] just that we're we're turning a new page
[51:10] uh necessarily in our physical sense but
[51:12] I believe his brother Timothy said last
[51:13] night that we're turning another chapter
[51:16] stepping into another realm than we've
[51:18] known before I believe as the bride of
[51:20] Christ we're looking at a New Horizon A
[51:23] A New Beginning where where men have not
[51:25] walked before I believe as the bride
[51:27] we're stepping into something that as
[51:29] brother Isaac preached last night it's
[51:31] our commission to fulfill something it's
[51:34] our commission to do something in this
[51:37] hour it's it's not just our commission
[51:39] to sit on a Pew and enjoy a service a
[51:41] week here and a week there and struggle
[51:43] back and forth with the world and we're
[51:45] hot one day and we're cold one day
[51:47] that's not our commission but our
[51:49] commission is to take another step that
[51:52] we might obtain a body change I believe
[51:55] there's not another age coming I believe
[51:57] we're in this last stage that we are
[51:59] stepping into a changing of even our
[52:02] mortal bodies I just as we reflect back
[52:05] over this year I'm sure we all could go
[52:07] back through and think about the trials
[52:09] and the my goodness how we've we've got
[52:12] we've got people that have moved across
[52:13] country and people that have moved from
[52:15] other continents and people just there
[52:17] seems to be a shaking going on and not
[52:20] just in the in in in the natural world
[52:22] out there with with Russia with with
[52:24] missiles every day and and the
[52:27] government's falling apart but there's a
[52:28] shaking going on because the bride is
[52:30] getting into position I believe it's
[52:32] because we I would say raise your hand
[52:35] say me I believe because me I am getting
[52:38] into position the world is shaking
[52:41] around me I believe that we make up that
[52:43] last few that are getting into line and
[52:45] when we get into line there's nothing
[52:47] holding back the Rapture of the church
[52:50] amen when she gets into her position I
[52:53] believe that's talking about me
[52:55] I believe that's talking about you so as
[52:57] we as we close out this old year let's
[52:59] not reflect back on the mistakes or or
[53:01] the trials or the sickness or the hurt
[53:04] but let's look ahead and see what God
[53:06] has at the new beginning what God has at
[53:09] this new horizon I'm excited to see what
[53:11] the Lord is doing in this coming year I
[53:14] believe it could be
[53:15] I'm not saying it is but could it be
[53:18] the year where we we are raptured home
[53:21] why not
[53:23] what are we waiting for are we waiting
[53:25] on anything else Brothers is there
[53:27] something I don't know about but I
[53:28] believe this this could be the year
[53:31] that we're all going home is that all
[53:33] right
[53:35] so let's just give the good a good
[53:37] stomping to the devil for our last
[53:38] service for the year maybe you had some
[53:41] hurts this year maybe you were sick or
[53:43] maybe you lost some loved ones maybe
[53:45] you're confused in your mind let's just
[53:46] give the devil a good stomping for our
[53:48] last service this year is that okay
[53:54] I don't think we should be we should be
[53:56] tender with them I don't think we should
[53:58] be afraid of him he's not your buddy
[54:00] he's not your pal he didn't treat you
[54:02] tenderly this last year but I think it's
[54:04] time to give the devil a good old stomp
[54:06] as we end this year
[54:08] I believe it's in it it's in us to do it
[54:10] you may you may think that he's he's
[54:13] ripped away parts of you that you'll
[54:14] never get back but you're complete in
[54:18] him
[54:19] it may feel sometimes like the devil's
[54:21] taking you and you got a complex there
[54:23] you gotta hurt there you know when you
[54:25] get injured you kind of favor that spot
[54:27] for a while and you feel that you got to
[54:29] cover it up
[54:30] but it's okay just to be free in the
[54:32] spirit of the lord it's okay to let that
[54:34] complex go and let that hurt go and just
[54:37] give the devil a good black eye before
[54:38] we end the year is that okay
[54:40] amen hallelujah
[54:43] we know that we're living in an age that
[54:45] that's been prophesied that there would
[54:47] be things fulfilled in this age we can
[54:49] go back through the book but I know this
[54:50] is a well-taught church but this is the
[54:52] age of the Overcomer that's what's
[54:54] prophesied for our age is that somebody
[54:56] is going to overcome I believe it's us
[54:59] somebody's going to take the book and
[55:02] eat it I believe it's uh somebody's
[55:04] going to fulfill all of the years of
[55:06] Prophecy that would make this message a
[55:08] prophetic word and fulfill it I believe
[55:10] it's us I believe we are the people of
[55:13] Prophecy of this message he was talking
[55:16] about us he's not talking about somebody
[55:18] else down the road he was preaching
[55:20] right to you in your Pew where you're at
[55:22] in your trial what you're going through
[55:24] he said you will overcome this age that
[55:28] you're in you will overcome the trial
[55:29] that you're in I've already seen it in a
[55:32] vision you'll have a mistake and you'll
[55:34] fall but you'll get back in line because
[55:36] I saw a Perfect Bride in the vision of
[55:39] God I believe we're walking in that
[55:41] Vision I I think we're all in one Accord
[55:43] tonight man it was just it was more than
[55:46] just a prophecy that came to to bring
[55:48] people around a man or to move people to
[55:51] Indiana or to move people to Arizona but
[55:54] it was such a prophetic word that there
[55:55] would be people that would come one day
[55:57] that would be the very fulfillment of
[56:00] what was seen not in a natural sense he
[56:03] didn't see it in the natural but in a
[56:05] super natural Realm
[56:07] I believe the prophet saw this church I
[56:10] believe that prophets saw a believer
[56:12] that was that was willing to stand for
[56:14] the word
[56:15] I wonder if there's anybody in here
[56:17] tonight I'm saying I'm willing to stand
[56:18] for the word maybe I didn't do that good
[56:21] of a job last year but this is a new
[56:23] year I say that you make a new
[56:25] declaration to say this coming year I
[56:27] will stand for the word no matter what
[56:30] may come I'll stand on the promise of
[56:32] God
[56:33] it's our commission
[56:36] this was more than just than just a a
[56:38] prophet came so that the pillar of fire
[56:41] could be captured over his head
[56:44] but I believe when the message came
[56:45] forward it struck more than just the
[56:48] lens of that photographer but I believe
[56:50] that light came and it struck the lens
[56:52] of Our Lives I believe it struck the
[56:54] lens of hearts that are yet to come and
[56:56] are coming in now I believe it struck my
[56:58] heart I was just a Sony uh Sinner and
[57:01] then when that voice came across it it
[57:03] shook more than a camera lens for me but
[57:05] it struck my life something cut across
[57:08] my life and I've never been the same
[57:10] since
[57:11] you know where that Pillar of Fire will
[57:13] do is it will show you your true colors
[57:17] I think we all want to know
[57:18] I believe uh you know
[57:21] you've been through we've been to a
[57:23] couple camps we've been to a at a couple
[57:25] altars and a couple counseling with some
[57:27] young people and it seems that the the
[57:29] biggest pressing pressing issue is
[57:31] people are scared they're an
[57:34] impersonator
[57:35] well that's my mission tonight if I
[57:37] don't do anything else is to let you
[57:39] know you're the real deal you're not
[57:41] impersonating anything but you're the
[57:43] real deal there's somebody that's going
[57:45] to fulfill it in the real way I believe
[57:48] it's us I believe this is the time I
[57:50] believe this is the season we're not
[57:52] impersonating anything we're the genuine
[57:55] article of what this message was written
[57:57] for we are the people of this message
[58:00] that's what we're manifesting we don't
[58:03] have to worry about impersonating
[58:05] but it was written about us
[58:08] I don't have to try to fit it like you
[58:10] said but I was made to fit this message
[58:12] I was made to just walk and step with it
[58:16] it was spoken over me already created in
[58:19] the mind of God I'm not having to worry
[58:21] about if I'm gonna make it it was spoken
[58:23] for me I'm already sent to it I'm
[58:26] already dressed
[58:27] that's why he came
[58:29] it shows us our colors
[58:33] Hallelujah Satan had has had his system
[58:36] at work again to get the people to
[58:38] misbelieve the word of God Satan's wrong
[58:41] way of worship
[58:43] so there's a wrong way to worship
[58:45] like Cain
[58:47] and like Balaam they're very religious
[58:49] Cain was religious he brought an altar
[58:51] made an altar and frankly Kane was more
[58:53] religious than Abel sure was he done
[58:55] more than the Lord for the Lord the
[58:57] neighbor ever did
[58:58] so let's just throw that complex out
[59:01] Cain did more for the Lord than than you
[59:03] ever did so don't worry about that
[59:06] but Abel come in the way of the word
[59:09] that's all he done more he built a great
[59:12] denomination he built a great thing a
[59:14] great Christian Heritage but you see he
[59:16] come in the wrong way it wasn't received
[59:20] for it was contrary to the word Balaam
[59:23] was just as religious as Moses he come
[59:25] with the same sacrifice the same Lambs
[59:27] the same clean animals and everything
[59:30] and pray to the same God and offered
[59:32] sacrifice to the same God that Moses did
[59:35] though he come in the wrong way
[59:38] it was contrary to the word like it was
[59:41] in Eden the word won't mix with modern
[59:43] Theory see you can't have modern Theory
[59:47] the word won't mix with it any modern
[59:50] Theory it can't have a theory and have
[59:53] the word
[59:55] okay
[59:56] you've got to have the word
[59:59] or the theory
[1:00:00] now which are you going to believe this
[1:00:03] is the prophet asking a question you
[1:00:05] can't have both
[1:00:06] you can't have your idea and the word
[1:00:09] you've got to have one or the other you
[1:00:12] can't have theoretically I like this pet
[1:00:14] Doctrine and I like the way that I can
[1:00:16] stay comfortable in my seat you can't
[1:00:18] have that and have the word at the same
[1:00:20] time so this is a choosing time that
[1:00:22] we're living in
[1:00:24] this is a time of choice where where
[1:00:26] it's not just shaking out of coincidence
[1:00:28] but hard choices are being made in this
[1:00:30] age where we're we're letting the dead
[1:00:32] bury their dead it's a hard choice to
[1:00:34] make but you've got to progress with the
[1:00:37] word
[1:00:38] you can't have your theory of it and
[1:00:40] have the word at the same time but
[1:00:42] you've got to make a choice
[1:00:44] we've got to recognize there's a way to
[1:00:46] know between what's Theory and what's
[1:00:48] the word in Israel's day they had a way
[1:00:51] that they could tell if it was the
[1:00:52] theory or if it was the voice of God
[1:00:54] right
[1:00:56] they were in the same situation we're in
[1:00:58] here's Balaam rising up as a false
[1:01:00] prophet and do we believe him he's got
[1:01:02] gifts and signs he's got a powerful
[1:01:04] Ministry do we believe that or do we
[1:01:06] stay with Moses in the voice of God
[1:01:08] see you see how you confusion comes in
[1:01:12] and the Devil is a is a master at
[1:01:15] getting in our mind and causing
[1:01:17] confusion and getting us to to look at a
[1:01:20] brother that we were we were so Kindred
[1:01:22] with at one time that there's no way
[1:01:24] that we would ever be pulled apart and
[1:01:25] now we're even doubting if he's a
[1:01:26] Christian because the devil's gotten in
[1:01:29] there and it's put a wedge between
[1:01:33] this I don't know I don't know what I'm
[1:01:35] getting into but
[1:01:40] confusion of the mind is where the devil
[1:01:42] works best
[1:01:43] if he can get in and confuse how how how
[1:01:46] we how we process what's going on in a
[1:01:50] church assembly you know a church
[1:01:51] assembly is the hardest place to get
[1:01:53] everybody to get along because everybody
[1:01:55] comes you're supposed to be accepting
[1:01:57] you're supposed to be welcoming but
[1:01:58] somebody's gonna have to stand for the
[1:02:00] word at some point and some toes will
[1:02:03] get stepped on at some point but it's
[1:02:05] got to be that way for us to stand for
[1:02:08] the word of course the devil's not he's
[1:02:10] going to try to come in here he's going
[1:02:12] to try to cause Discord he's going to
[1:02:13] try to cause disruption that's his job
[1:02:16] but our job as a Ministry is to call out
[1:02:19] those things and say that is false
[1:02:22] that's not what the prophet said that's
[1:02:24] not the way we should act and carry on
[1:02:26] that's not and some might call it a
[1:02:28] clothesline religion but I for one am a
[1:02:30] preacher who believes that the word is
[1:02:32] still the word and it should be preached
[1:02:35] as the prophet preached it as Paul
[1:02:37] preached it as Timothy preached it it
[1:02:39] should be preached the same way we
[1:02:41] shouldn't have to change the word to
[1:02:43] change with the times but God's word is
[1:02:46] never failing well I don't like the way
[1:02:49] that that old word made me feel well you
[1:02:51] need to change you don't try to change
[1:02:54] the word and say well it really hurt me
[1:02:55] the way that that was brought the word
[1:02:57] is the word
[1:03:00] there's a way to know if it's your
[1:03:02] theory or if it's the word
[1:03:04] like I said in in Israel's day
[1:03:09] they had a way to know
[1:03:11] but the devil's so good he will try to
[1:03:13] impersonate everything up to the word
[1:03:16] he can sing
[1:03:18] he can shout he can dance he can sit
[1:03:21] there like a bump on a log he could say
[1:03:24] man
[1:03:25] you can say Glory
[1:03:27] he can impersonate everything except for
[1:03:31] the word
[1:03:32] and the Bible said that in the last days
[1:03:34] the devil will impersonate Christianity
[1:03:36] so close till it'll deceive the very
[1:03:38] elected if possible
[1:03:41] I love that word
[1:03:43] if
[1:03:45] possible
[1:03:46] if it were possible we would be deceived
[1:03:50] that's right so we must test it and how
[1:03:52] did they test it in their day to the
[1:03:54] urum and thumb the breastplate of Aaron
[1:03:56] that had those stones in it the
[1:03:57] carbuncle Jasper Diamond Ruby Sapphire
[1:03:59] all those tones that represented the
[1:04:01] birth of these 12 Patriarchs was in the
[1:04:04] breastplate of Aaron and when a prophet
[1:04:05] prophesied in that sacred light flashed
[1:04:07] over God said that is the truth but no
[1:04:10] matter how real it seemed if it didn't
[1:04:12] flash on that it wasn't the truth so
[1:04:14] that yerman thumb and went with that
[1:04:16] priesthood but this Bible is God's urum
[1:04:19] thumbum today and when a prophet
[1:04:21] prophesies it must absolutely flash with
[1:04:24] the Bible
[1:04:25] then God says and he comes down and
[1:04:28] proves it this is a word Prophet telling
[1:04:30] you how to identify a word prophet if
[1:04:33] what I say does not line up with the
[1:04:34] Bible then don't believe me but if what
[1:04:36] I say lines up with the Bible it's the
[1:04:39] urum and thumb for today and it's thus
[1:04:41] saith the Lord
[1:04:43] right so there's a way to know now you
[1:04:46] think well if we had that that holy of
[1:04:48] holies and we could walk back in there
[1:04:50] and we could have those stones Flash and
[1:04:52] we could ask it a question am I going
[1:04:54] the right direction in my life is this
[1:04:56] the perfect will of God for my life you
[1:04:59] walk in there and as the voice would
[1:05:00] ring forth the stones would cast a
[1:05:02] rainbow
[1:05:03] or they would not and by that you would
[1:05:05] know that dream was of the Lord that
[1:05:07] prophecy was of the Lord or that tongues
[1:05:09] was of the Lord but but the light had to
[1:05:12] ring true
[1:05:13] in order for that to be lined up now
[1:05:15] there's a specific order to how God
[1:05:17] designed this and I believe there's a
[1:05:20] specific order uh to how he's designed
[1:05:22] the church in this last age it's okay if
[1:05:25] we're just trying to build a little bit
[1:05:35] it's all right
[1:05:36] I'm not a tech guy but I got a buddy Joe
[1:05:39] and a buddy
[1:05:41] that uh maybe has a picture of that this
[1:05:43] is out of Exodus 28.
[1:05:45] I know this is maybe a little Sunday
[1:05:47] school on a Saturday night but that's
[1:05:48] all right and thou shalt make the
[1:05:50] breastplate of judgment with cunning
[1:05:51] work
[1:05:52] after the work of the ephot Thou shalt
[1:05:54] make it of gold a blue and a purple and
[1:05:56] of scarlet and a fine twine linen shout
[1:05:58] thou make it Foursquare it shall be
[1:06:00] doubled a span shall be the length
[1:06:02] thereof and a span shall be the breadth
[1:06:04] thereof and thou shalt said in settings
[1:06:06] of stones even four rows of stones the
[1:06:08] first row shall be as hard as a topaz
[1:06:10] and a carbuncle this shall be the first
[1:06:12] row and the second row shall be an
[1:06:14] emerald a sapphire and a diamond and the
[1:06:17] third row a legur and a gate in an
[1:06:19] amethyst and the fourth row a barrel and
[1:06:22] an onyx and a Jasper they shall be set
[1:06:25] in gold in their enclosings
[1:06:27] and the stone shall be with the names of
[1:06:29] the children of Israel 12 according to
[1:06:31] their names like the Engravings of a
[1:06:33] Signet everyone with his name shall they
[1:06:35] be according to the 12 tribes so those
[1:06:38] are pretty Specific Instructions right
[1:06:41] and we got the picture of it up there
[1:06:42] see it's pretty specific how it's laid
[1:06:44] out and there's a specific stone for
[1:06:47] each row
[1:06:48] and the roads were identified of course
[1:06:50] gold being the backlayment and they
[1:06:52] would they would fashion this gold and
[1:06:54] and this was this was the most holy
[1:06:56] place that there that there was in
[1:06:58] Israel
[1:06:59] so this wasn't just thrown together in
[1:07:01] some some Pebbles glued on there
[1:07:03] but this was gold that was fashioned in
[1:07:05] the fire that was beaten until they
[1:07:07] could see their reflection and then they
[1:07:09] chose these Stones by hand and as the
[1:07:11] lord gave him instruction they would say
[1:07:12] these Stones because this is the only
[1:07:14] way now it sounds very unnatural for you
[1:07:18] to be able to speak to those stones and
[1:07:20] them to cast a light
[1:07:22] right
[1:07:23] it seems very unnatural that you would
[1:07:25] be able to to put on a tape somewhere
[1:07:28] sometime while you're living in sin and
[1:07:30] all of a sudden your life just flip
[1:07:32] around it seems very unnatural that you
[1:07:34] might drag yourself into the back door
[1:07:35] and the voice of the preacher coming
[1:07:37] across the pulpit might change your life
[1:07:39] forever seems pretty unnatural but God
[1:07:42] is a supernatural God God is such a
[1:07:45] supernatural God that even the sound of
[1:07:48] his voice can change your entire outcome
[1:07:50] of where you're headed in your life just
[1:07:52] one word from him can change every
[1:07:54] direction in which we're headed you
[1:07:56] might think well I know the path I'm
[1:07:58] headed but you wait till God says
[1:08:00] something else about it wait till God
[1:08:02] changes the very direction that you're
[1:08:03] headed in
[1:08:05] he's a supernatural God but these this
[1:08:08] voice was spoken over the stones and it
[1:08:10] Vindicated it to be the voice of the
[1:08:11] Lord
[1:08:12] but we don't have the urim and some of
[1:08:14] them today
[1:08:15] I mean brother Tim's got a mini one in
[1:08:16] his office I saw but I don't think it
[1:08:18] probably ring the rainbow colors
[1:08:22] we don't have that today
[1:08:23] you imagine if we had that today how
[1:08:25] many people will be fighting for it
[1:08:29] to know the to know the will of God to
[1:08:31] know the perfect word how many people
[1:08:33] would be coveting that
[1:08:34] how many people would fight their way
[1:08:37] to get to that urm and thumb them that
[1:08:39] they might know that this is the right
[1:08:41] way to go
[1:08:42] I mean how many in here we want to know
[1:08:44] I'm in the perfect will of God
[1:08:46] I'm in the perfect will if you know
[1:08:48] you're walking in the perfect will you
[1:08:50] can be absolutely Fearless of where
[1:08:52] you're headed because you know you're on
[1:08:54] a commission you know that you've been
[1:08:56] purposed for it I believe that if we had
[1:08:58] the actual physical urum and thumb today
[1:09:00] there would be a riot to get your hands
[1:09:02] on it right there'd be a there'd be a
[1:09:04] line out the door where people would
[1:09:06] come in and they'd want to have their
[1:09:08] their moment with the urum and thumb
[1:09:09] them right kind of like when the prophet
[1:09:11] was here and they wanted to have just
[1:09:13] their couple minutes with the profit
[1:09:14] they wouldn't take the time to listen to
[1:09:16] what he was preaching but they wanted
[1:09:17] their couple minutes with him that he
[1:09:20] might discern them and it would take the
[1:09:21] easy way out of the situation we don't
[1:09:23] live in an easy age
[1:09:25] this is not an easy button age but this
[1:09:28] is the hardest age that there ever has
[1:09:30] been
[1:09:31] this is the darkest hour that there ever
[1:09:33] will be we don't live in an easy button
[1:09:36] age
[1:09:37] that would be nice and I'm not I'm not
[1:09:38] shaming anybody that has a tremendous
[1:09:40] testimony that's not what I'm getting at
[1:09:42] of visiting with a prophet in the
[1:09:43] miraculous happening obviously I believe
[1:09:45] God sent a prophet and I believe he had
[1:09:48] the Messiah sign and I would have I
[1:09:50] would have traveled across the world to
[1:09:52] spend just a couple minutes
[1:09:54] but we don't have that today
[1:09:56] we don't have the urum in some of them
[1:09:58] today so it must be that thus saith the
[1:10:01] Lord's not here today
[1:10:06] no I don't believe that
[1:10:08] I don't believe that thus saith the Lord
[1:10:10] cease to exist on December the 24th 1965
[1:10:13] but I believe we have the saith the Lord
[1:10:17] in our midst I believe what the prophet
[1:10:19] preached to us was that the bride has
[1:10:21] thus saith the Lord or she keeps still
[1:10:24] right so that means it's laying within
[1:10:27] the church thus saith the Lord is still
[1:10:29] laying within the church what is it it's
[1:10:32] the Vindicated word of the hour coming
[1:10:34] out just like he preached it
[1:10:38] now we live in an age of confusion right
[1:10:40] where the devil's getting in and he's
[1:10:41] trying to confuse this and confuse that
[1:10:43] and he'll take a quote and make you
[1:10:45] think that you don't have you don't have
[1:10:47] the Holy Ghost
[1:10:48] and he'll take a quote and make you
[1:10:50] think that there's no way you could be
[1:10:51] lost and we're back and forth and back
[1:10:53] and forth but there is a way to know
[1:10:55] that we're walking in the perfect will
[1:10:57] of God there's a way to know that
[1:10:59] there's a balance to this
[1:11:01] there's a way to know that you have the
[1:11:03] whole package already in you you're not
[1:11:06] waiting for it to come but it's already
[1:11:08] laying within you these Stones here on
[1:11:10] this tablet were just Stones they just
[1:11:14] laid there on that year and thumb and
[1:11:16] they just laid there in that in that
[1:11:17] tent way back in there until a voice
[1:11:20] came across them and then all of a
[1:11:22] sudden those stones had a purpose those
[1:11:25] stones reflected a light they reflected
[1:11:27] the voice of God that came out across
[1:11:29] them and they became a value right until
[1:11:32] then they were just laying dormant in
[1:11:34] the in in the tent there but they had a
[1:11:37] purpose
[1:11:38] I believe we have the saith the Lord
[1:11:41] we'll do exactly what he's said to do in
[1:11:43] the spirit that he said to do it it's
[1:11:46] not so much that I can type in here
[1:11:48] anybody can grab a table app and they
[1:11:50] can type in their favorite quote and you
[1:11:52] can feed me all these quotes but if you
[1:11:53] don't have the spirit
[1:11:55] of how the prophet brought it then it's
[1:11:58] never gonna free anybody it's never
[1:12:01] going to heal anybody it's never going
[1:12:02] to bring Liberation to anybody but
[1:12:04] you've got to have the spirit that the
[1:12:07] messenger brought it in is that okay
[1:12:09] it's our commission if I could say it's
[1:12:13] the challenge of the hour to walk in the
[1:12:16] spirit of the word not just quote it
[1:12:18] fundamentally but to walk in the spirit
[1:12:20] of the word
[1:12:22] Hallelujah
[1:12:25] and there came out of nowhere don't even
[1:12:26] give his name I don't guess the prophet
[1:12:28] was interested in his name he was
[1:12:30] interested in one thing God had anointed
[1:12:32] him he didn't make any difference
[1:12:33] whether he was classed one of their
[1:12:34] denominations or something else whether
[1:12:36] he was a bishop or an Archbishop the
[1:12:38] only thing that he was interested in was
[1:12:40] the message on his heart and he called
[1:12:43] the people back to repentance and an
[1:12:45] understanding that their God was a god
[1:12:47] of Might and a god of Deliverance a god
[1:12:49] of Miracles that snatched him out of the
[1:12:51] hands of the Egyptians opened up the Red
[1:12:53] Sea and fed them into the Wilderness and
[1:12:55] the god a god of Might who could take
[1:12:58] the land from someone else and give it
[1:13:00] to them amen that was a true prophet he
[1:13:02] was anointed and he was the voice of God
[1:13:04] to them people he spoke it that it must
[1:13:07] be so because they were in trouble these
[1:13:09] midianites and amorites and so forth had
[1:13:11] all come over to eat up all their land
[1:13:13] and so the enemy had challenged and he
[1:13:16] must be met
[1:13:19] the enemy's challenged and he must be
[1:13:22] met
[1:13:22] we're living at the same Junction of
[1:13:24] time the armies couldn't do it and their
[1:13:27] priests couldn't do it and their
[1:13:28] churches couldn't do it so it took the
[1:13:30] word of God to meet his Challenge and
[1:13:33] the enemy speaks today the enemy tries
[1:13:35] to say to the days of Miracles has
[1:13:37] passed and there's no such thing as the
[1:13:38] baptism in the Holy Spirit and this is
[1:13:41] only emotion it's only a workup so the
[1:13:43] enemy has challenged and his challenge
[1:13:46] must be met are we ready to meet the
[1:13:49] challenge of the hour the only way we
[1:13:52] can meet the challenge of the day when
[1:13:53] the denominations call the people away
[1:13:55] and put them in this organization and
[1:13:57] that organization let them women cut
[1:13:59] their hair and make up and man in all
[1:14:01] kinds of lives lives as trustees and
[1:14:03] deacons and Pastors in the church
[1:14:05] because they got some PhD or lld is the
[1:14:08] requirement Jesus never did require a
[1:14:10] man to have that Jesus requirement was
[1:14:13] wait
[1:14:14] in the city of Jerusalem until you're
[1:14:16] endued with power from on high then you
[1:14:20] are a witness to me that meets his
[1:14:23] challenge that meant the enemy's
[1:14:24] challenge that meant it in that day it
[1:14:26] will meet it in this day
[1:14:29] that's why the Church of the Living God
[1:14:31] has such an attack on how we worship
[1:14:33] that's why the Church of the Living God
[1:14:36] is is trying to be bound up that we're
[1:14:39] too free or are we worshiped too freely
[1:14:41] or we enjoy ourselves a little bit too
[1:14:43] much well you can have your opinion but
[1:14:46] as for me I'll rise to the challenge of
[1:14:48] the hour you can believe it the way you
[1:14:50] want to but as for me I'll go ahead and
[1:14:53] enjoy salvation as for me I'll go ahead
[1:14:55] and enjoy joy in my life I'll enjoy not
[1:14:59] having bondage I'll enjoy not being a
[1:15:01] changer shackles are wondering if I'm
[1:15:03] going to make a Rapture I'll go ahead
[1:15:05] and enjoy the Liberty that comes with
[1:15:08] the revealed word of the hour to say I
[1:15:11] never did it in the first place
[1:15:14] oh please that's the challenge of the
[1:15:17] hour not to be in bondage anybody could
[1:15:20] be in bondage we are called a commission
[1:15:22] to break free from that and say I am a
[1:15:25] different level
[1:15:27] I'll now settle for methodists or
[1:15:29] Baptists or Presbyterian somewhere out
[1:15:32] from another cut
[1:15:33] I came from another section of the cloth
[1:15:37] in my section we're free in my section
[1:15:40] we have Liberty to Worship in my section
[1:15:43] of heaven we go ahead and shout and we
[1:15:45] say amen and we say holy holy holy to
[1:15:49] the Lord
[1:15:52] that's what we were called to do the
[1:15:54] challenge of the hour has been brought
[1:15:55] to our door what will we do with it
[1:15:59] it'll be back up and say you know I'm
[1:16:01] just going to go ahead and back up on
[1:16:02] the way I believe
[1:16:03] or are we called to meet the challenge
[1:16:05] of the hour
[1:16:07] that's been brought to our church into
[1:16:09] our home into our beliefs
[1:16:11] don't tell me that you haven't ran
[1:16:12] across it
[1:16:13] because it's coming against the Church
[1:16:15] of the Living God
[1:16:17] not just here in Louisiana but all over
[1:16:19] the world the challenge is brought to
[1:16:21] the church
[1:16:23] will we back down
[1:16:25] will we take the word and move forward
[1:16:28] if God be with us
[1:16:30] he says how can the Holy Spirit who
[1:16:32] wrote the Bible deny it
[1:16:34] how can the Holy Spirit living in a man
[1:16:36] say oh it was for the disciples
[1:16:39] Jesus said whosoever will Peter said the
[1:16:42] promise is unto you and to your children
[1:16:43] and then that's so far off even as many
[1:16:45] as the Lord Our God shall call the Holy
[1:16:47] Ghost was for whomever God called
[1:16:50] so we say God called me
[1:16:53] here he said those who he predestinated
[1:16:55] he foreknew he ordained and they
[1:16:57] accepted no man can come to me said
[1:17:00] Jesus said my father draws him and all
[1:17:01] that the father has given me will come
[1:17:03] to me do we come in a worked up emotion
[1:17:07] do we come to join the church
[1:17:09] do we come because we don't want to go
[1:17:11] to hell or do we come because we love
[1:17:13] God that gave His only begotten son that
[1:17:17] whosoever believeth in him should have
[1:17:19] everlasting life do we come because it's
[1:17:22] a love sacrifice that God give to us
[1:17:24] that we might display it display it he
[1:17:28] says God hates
[1:17:32] man if I'm serving God
[1:17:35] I'd want to know what he hates
[1:17:36] [Applause]
[1:17:38] if I'm trying to be the best Christian I
[1:17:40] can be and actually approach the word
[1:17:43] with an open ear and an open eye and an
[1:17:46] open heart and actually approach the
[1:17:48] message with no preconceived ideas of
[1:17:50] what I wanted to be I would want to know
[1:17:52] what God hates
[1:17:54] for example if you search it in the in
[1:17:56] the in the search God hates Discord
[1:17:59] among the brethren
[1:18:01] God hates it he hates backfighting he
[1:18:04] hates the gossip he hates the back and
[1:18:06] forth and do what you can to to to kill
[1:18:08] somebody's testimony or their character
[1:18:10] God hates it
[1:18:13] you know what else God hates a powerless
[1:18:16] religion
[1:18:17] he hates it I'd want to know what God
[1:18:20] hates and if I was trying to please
[1:18:22] please the Lord I'd want to run as far
[1:18:25] away as I could from what God hates I'd
[1:18:28] want to get as far away from that as I
[1:18:31] possibly could if God hates a powerless
[1:18:34] religion I don't want to be identified
[1:18:36] anywhere near a powerless religion
[1:18:38] you'll never confuse me for being a
[1:18:40] psychologist I want to be so far away
[1:18:43] from that that you'll never have to ask
[1:18:45] me the question what do you believe
[1:18:48] to let my voice read tonight to say I
[1:18:51] believe in a religion with power
[1:18:54] I believe in a god with power
[1:18:57] the Holy Ghost with power
[1:19:00] I believe in the people with power
[1:19:03] that will perform the works because it's
[1:19:06] him and them performing them
[1:19:10] that's what we believe don't be yoked up
[1:19:12] with that
[1:19:14] but get free from that I don't want to
[1:19:16] be anywhere near it
[1:19:18] you'll never confuse me for that
[1:19:21] why because I preach against it and the
[1:19:24] problem is we have too many weak pulpits
[1:19:26] that are so afraid to lose somebody
[1:19:28] they're so afraid to lose people or lose
[1:19:31] or lose a mentor somewhere they're
[1:19:33] afraid to preach the truth and then we
[1:19:36] have the Holy Ghost on the outside of
[1:19:38] the church
[1:19:39] wanting to get in
[1:19:40] [Applause]
[1:19:42] it's okay
[1:19:46] I get a little carried away
[1:19:48] so never confuse me for that
[1:19:53] why would we want to be confused for
[1:19:55] that
[1:19:56] God hates it
[1:19:58] he hates
[1:20:00] a powerless religion
[1:20:02] their religion has no power so what must
[1:20:06] he do to this day every time in the
[1:20:08] Bible that God ever
[1:20:10] every time that there ever came a
[1:20:12] Reformation or Revival it was backed
[1:20:13] with Great Signs and powers where God is
[1:20:17] he is Supernatural
[1:20:19] where God displays himself there's got
[1:20:22] to be Supernatural
[1:20:27] he can impersonate
[1:20:29] almost up to the real thing
[1:20:32] they can impersonate almost up to the
[1:20:35] real thing but you're not an
[1:20:36] impersonation Church
[1:20:38] you're not an impersonation you're the
[1:20:40] genuine article
[1:20:42] you're the real deal you know there's
[1:20:44] art collectors from all over the world
[1:20:46] and their job is to examine a piece and
[1:20:48] to identify that it's the real deal to
[1:20:51] identify that it's the real peace and
[1:20:53] say yeah that that's the one see this
[1:20:56] one here it's got a little you know it
[1:20:57] was it was made it was a good
[1:20:59] impersonation but it's not the real deal
[1:21:01] but I believe I'm preaching to the real
[1:21:04] deal tonight
[1:21:05] that wasn't just forced and some
[1:21:07] denominations somewhere through some
[1:21:09] man's Theory but but God called us here
[1:21:11] that we might fulfill
[1:21:13] [Applause]
[1:21:14] Ed the Rapture of this age
[1:21:17] he can impersonate it but he can't be
[1:21:19] you
[1:21:21] nobody can have your spot
[1:21:25] nobody
[1:21:26] I can't have it
[1:21:28] but Aaron can't have it nobody can have
[1:21:31] your spot
[1:21:32] you don't need to change to be like me
[1:21:34] or change to be like brother Joe God
[1:21:36] made you exactly how you are you're an
[1:21:39] original you're a one-off you're a piece
[1:21:42] of art you're you're so handcrafted in
[1:21:45] his mind that he made you exactly the
[1:21:47] way you are that even through those
[1:21:49] complexes you could fulfill all
[1:21:52] righteousness it's in you to do it it's
[1:21:54] in you to take a body change it's
[1:21:56] already laying within you you don't need
[1:21:58] to change you just need to get under the
[1:22:00] power of the Holy Ghost and those stones
[1:22:03] that laid their dormant will become
[1:22:05] living stones that will come Lively
[1:22:07] Stones they'll become alive with the
[1:22:09] fire of God
[1:22:10] now the scripture says that when the
[1:22:12] voice came forth a light went across the
[1:22:14] stones but they did not have a
[1:22:16] flashlight or a light bulb there but a
[1:22:18] light in the scripture is the fire of
[1:22:20] God
[1:22:21] so when his voice came out it was actual
[1:22:24] fire that went through that tent and
[1:22:26] cast upon the stones and they became
[1:22:29] Lively Stones I don't believe in second
[1:22:31] Peter he said that we're to be dead
[1:22:32] stones
[1:22:33] but we're to be Lively Stones is that
[1:22:36] okay I'm not trying to work you up I'm
[1:22:38] preaching you the scripture
[1:22:41] I think it's time that we identify where
[1:22:43] we're at
[1:22:45] I don't think we should back up to
[1:22:46] anybody
[1:22:47] say no just I'll just humble down on on
[1:22:50] the word no I'll humble down on a lot of
[1:22:53] things but I will not humble down on the
[1:22:55] word
[1:23:00] Esau represented the man of Earth
[1:23:02] natural religious incline but never able
[1:23:05] it wasn't in him to do it
[1:23:09] he couldn't do it
[1:23:10] he never was in him to be able to climb
[1:23:14] a past the things of the world the
[1:23:16] carnal thing but Jacob it was just so
[1:23:19] easy for him to do it now Jacob one
[1:23:22] purpose Jacob had and that was that he
[1:23:24] longed for that Birthright no matter how
[1:23:27] he got it just so he got it it wasn't in
[1:23:31] Esau to do it
[1:23:34] wasn't in it
[1:23:36] he didn't have the capability
[1:23:38] to hunger and thirst for that Birthright
[1:23:40] he couldn't do it
[1:23:42] Jacob could go to a place
[1:23:45] that Esau literally could not go
[1:23:48] the the prophet said it right there it
[1:23:51] wasn't in him
[1:23:52] yeah it wasn't in him he couldn't do it
[1:23:54] it didn't ring true there was there was
[1:23:56] nothing he could do with it it just
[1:23:57] wasn't it wasn't in him to take the
[1:23:59] birthright like the brother said last
[1:24:01] night
[1:24:02] we're built to go places yeah that the
[1:24:05] devil can't follow us it's not in him to
[1:24:09] do it we're built to go places into the
[1:24:12] word that the devil never even thought
[1:24:13] of going he never even imagined that it
[1:24:15] was a possibility but it's in us to do
[1:24:17] it we're built for the challenge of the
[1:24:20] hour We're made with the ingredients
[1:24:22] it's going to take to overcome the
[1:24:24] challenge of the hour we don't got to
[1:24:25] worry about him impersonating us we've
[1:24:27] got to get to a place where he can't
[1:24:29] follow us we've got to climb to a higher
[1:24:32] realm where he cannot walk with us
[1:24:33] anymore he can't walk straight for
[1:24:36] stride with us where we're going
[1:24:38] there's somewhere where he's going to
[1:24:40] get caught up there's somewhere where he
[1:24:42] cannot fulfill the whole word there's
[1:24:44] somewhere where he's not going to do it
[1:24:46] now if I if if let's just God forgive me
[1:24:50] but let's just say I was Lucifer
[1:24:52] preaching to you tonight
[1:24:54] and I was using the message and I was
[1:24:56] using the quotes and I was quoting all
[1:24:58] your favorite preachers
[1:25:00] and I was I was preaching it hard to you
[1:25:02] with power
[1:25:04] would you be able to say man careful
[1:25:06] would you be able to say Amen
[1:25:09] no because I'm gonna use it for my
[1:25:12] benefit if I'm Lucifer I'm never going
[1:25:15] to take you to a place where you're free
[1:25:16] I can't it's not in me to do it if I'm
[1:25:20] Lucifer I'm physically incapable of
[1:25:23] preaching the word in a position where
[1:25:25] you get Liberty I'm physically incapable
[1:25:28] of preaching the entire word in a way
[1:25:30] that you could go free
[1:25:34] so you see it's easy to discern a spirit
[1:25:36] no matter how Mighty the Mind might be
[1:25:38] or how big his church might be or how
[1:25:40] many members worship him it's easy to
[1:25:43] identify a spirit if it brings you down
[1:25:45] it's not the word if it lifts you up
[1:25:49] it's the word of the hour if it lifts
[1:25:51] you up it's Vindicated if it lifts you
[1:25:54] up you're free if it lifts you up I say
[1:25:56] walk in Freedom
[1:25:59] but don't dare be found
[1:26:01] caught in transition between a Ministry
[1:26:03] that will drive you down and you lead
[1:26:05] more depressed than what you came in
[1:26:07] that's not the spirit of the message
[1:26:10] that's some man's Theory or some spin on
[1:26:13] what the prophet preached that is not
[1:26:15] what I hear when I hear William Brandon
[1:26:17] preach
[1:26:18] what I hear when I hear Tim Pruitt
[1:26:20] preach that's not what I hear when I
[1:26:22] hear weight loss and preach I hear the
[1:26:24] spirit of Liberty ringing out over the
[1:26:26] people of God saying go free you're free
[1:26:30] you're free
[1:26:34] that's the spirit of the message
[1:26:38] not only do we got to say what he said
[1:26:40] we've got to say in the spirit that he
[1:26:43] said it is
[1:26:44] why is that so hard say it in the spirit
[1:26:47] why it's so hard is because you don't
[1:26:48] listen to the tank
[1:26:50] it's so hard because you just read that
[1:26:52] one quote and move on listen to the
[1:26:55] message
[1:26:56] it will never bring you down
[1:26:58] [Applause]
[1:27:01] it's liberty it's our hope it's Christ
[1:27:04] in this hour how could it bring you down
[1:27:08] how could it make you feel like you're
[1:27:10] gonna miss it like you somehow missed
[1:27:12] something you are complete in him
[1:27:15] thank you
[1:27:16] not missed it you are it
[1:27:19] it's about you this whole book is about
[1:27:22] you it's Christ coming out in the bride
[1:27:25] it's a love story it's a book of love
[1:27:29] it's about you
[1:27:31] like a book about me ever read about my
[1:27:33] wife it's my love story
[1:27:35] [Applause]
[1:27:37] it's about her
[1:27:40] [Applause]
[1:27:41] why would we ever feel condemned reading
[1:27:43] it
[1:27:44] how can we look at this and say oh I
[1:27:46] just don't know
[1:27:48] when I read this I can't help but cry
[1:27:51] he's talking about me
[1:27:54] [Applause]
[1:27:56] I will put my spirit
[1:27:59] in her
[1:28:01] and she will perform the Greater Works
[1:28:04] not only that but I'm Gonna Save the
[1:28:06] final word for her
[1:28:09] [Applause]
[1:28:18] you're built for better than where we're
[1:28:20] living
[1:28:21] you're built for higher than wherever
[1:28:22] you're at I guarantee I know I'm built
[1:28:25] for higher than where I'm living I was
[1:28:27] built to fulfill every word every line
[1:28:30] every letter every punctuation I was
[1:28:33] built for it God spoke it because he
[1:28:35] knew that was what I would do God spoke
[1:28:38] the word because he knew there would be
[1:28:39] somebody come that would say it's mine
[1:28:42] he did it I can too if you did it I can
[1:28:46] too
[1:28:47] this is not a one-man message this is an
[1:28:49] I can too message
[1:28:51] we're walking where the Angels Fear to
[1:28:54] try
[1:28:55] in the Divine word of the hour
[1:28:58] ah we should not be ashamed of anything
[1:29:00] that we're doing
[1:29:02] I rebuke that spirit that would come on
[1:29:05] the Church of the Living God that would
[1:29:06] bring her down for realizing where she's
[1:29:09] at and then feeling sorry for it no
[1:29:12] not while I have breath in my lung I say
[1:29:14] recognize where you're at and give God
[1:29:17] praise for it is that I recognize all
[1:29:20] free I recognize that I'm liberated I
[1:29:23] recognize
[1:29:28] you know what else Scott Hanks on
[1:29:30] Nickelodeon Spirit I'm free from that
[1:29:37] we're free but now we're free we ain't
[1:29:40] gotta worry about it God spoke it over
[1:29:43] us
[1:29:44] there will be a people I say it's us I
[1:29:48] say here I am
[1:29:54] he's not built to walk where you can
[1:29:57] walk
[1:29:57] he physically is incapable of it
[1:30:04] I left my hanky in that jacket somewhere
[1:30:08] he can't do it
[1:30:13] you're built higher than he was built
[1:30:17] You Came From Another Part of the mind
[1:30:18] of God
[1:30:19] you came from a little part tucked away
[1:30:21] back in there
[1:30:23] where that covering cherub never was
[1:30:25] able to see
[1:30:26] that covering cherub didn't have access
[1:30:28] to where you came from you didn't come
[1:30:31] from the realm of anxiety and depression
[1:30:33] and sickness and cancer you didn't come
[1:30:35] from that realm You Came From Another
[1:30:37] realm beyond that that the angel
[1:30:39] couldn't even look at
[1:30:41] that those angels couldn't even see we
[1:30:43] came from a higher realm than that
[1:30:45] from the very back part
[1:30:48] of the mind of God
[1:30:50] that's where I came from
[1:30:52] that's why I'm not scared to walk here
[1:30:54] at this is not my home here but it will
[1:30:56] be
[1:30:59] I don't want to fit in here
[1:31:01] I don't want to blend in at Walmart
[1:31:02] wasn't made for that I was made to blend
[1:31:05] in with those that came from the back
[1:31:07] part of the mind of God now I cannot
[1:31:09] help it how we act when we came from the
[1:31:11] back part of the mind of God
[1:31:13] but I know we came from the same place
[1:31:15] I'm not ashamed to act like people that
[1:31:17] where I came from where the failure not
[1:31:19] ashamed to act where you the
[1:31:20] neighborhood you grow up in when you get
[1:31:22] around you're saying This Is How Country
[1:31:23] Boys act well this is how the bride of
[1:31:25] Christ Acts
[1:31:26] this is how we Act
[1:31:28] we act free
[1:31:30] forgive me if I don't have shackles
[1:31:32] binding me but I'm free forgive me if
[1:31:36] I'm liberated in my spirit where I can
[1:31:38] say glory to God and not get rust out of
[1:31:41] the church building but I'm free
[1:31:44] and he who the son has set free is free
[1:31:48] indeed
[1:31:50] somebody say indeed
[1:31:53] he physically is not able to do it if
[1:31:55] you can pull up Ezekiel 28
[1:31:59] and the 11th verse Man time is flying
[1:32:02] moreover the word of the Lord came unto
[1:32:04] me saying son of man take up lamentation
[1:32:06] upon the king of tires of course your
[1:32:08] Bible students you know speaking of
[1:32:09] Lucifer and say unto him thus say the
[1:32:12] Lord God thou sealst up the sum full of
[1:32:14] wisdom and perfect and Beauty thou
[1:32:15] husband and eat in the garden of God
[1:32:17] every precious stone was thy covering
[1:32:19] the Sardis topaz and the diamond the
[1:32:21] barrel the Onyx the Jaspers Sapphire the
[1:32:23] emerald and the carbuncle and on gold
[1:32:26] the workmanship of the tablets on the
[1:32:28] pipes was prepared in thee in the day
[1:32:30] that was created
[1:32:31] Thou Art the anointed cherub that
[1:32:33] covereth and I have set thee so thou was
[1:32:36] upon the holy mountain of God thouest
[1:32:38] walked up and and down in the midst of
[1:32:40] the stones of fire that was perfect in
[1:32:42] thy ways from the day that was created
[1:32:45] until
[1:32:47] iniquity
[1:32:49] was found in thee
[1:32:53] he's built differently
[1:32:55] you're a civil engineer
[1:32:57] how many stones did we just count
[1:32:59] I'm gonna help you nine
[1:33:01] nine how many do we count in Exodus 28.
[1:33:06] 12.
[1:33:08] I'm not a math wizard but it seems like
[1:33:10] there's something missing
[1:33:11] it seems that that God's specific
[1:33:14] ingredients were were right and they
[1:33:16] were perfect and then when it came down
[1:33:18] to Bill Lucifer something was left out
[1:33:22] he's physically not built the same
[1:33:25] as you're built he's missing something
[1:33:28] that you have if you take the time to
[1:33:30] study it we're we're short on time but
[1:33:32] if you take the time to study it he's
[1:33:33] missing the third row
[1:33:35] he's got the first the second and the
[1:33:37] fourth he's missing the third row of
[1:33:39] stones remember how exact
[1:33:41] the the breastplate was to be built it
[1:33:44] was to be built exactly under the order
[1:33:46] which Moses gave right exactly this
[1:33:49] direction exactly these stones in this
[1:33:51] place representing these exact tribes
[1:33:53] but he's missing the third row
[1:33:59] I'm glad we can walk places where the
[1:34:02] devil cannot walk I'm glad we can
[1:34:04] receive a word that's why when the word
[1:34:06] comes forth somehow it just doesn't ring
[1:34:08] with somebody you say hey man what's the
[1:34:10] matter with you it's not ringing but for
[1:34:12] me it's ringing for you it's ringing we
[1:34:15] say hey that Lit me up why because we're
[1:34:17] built different than Lucifer was built
[1:34:20] we're built different than the serpent
[1:34:22] was built he was built lower than we
[1:34:24] were built
[1:34:25] it's missing the third row
[1:34:28] we're not
[1:34:30] you'll never get a seven color rainbow
[1:34:32] if you're missing those three stones
[1:34:34] you'll never get the full contrast of
[1:34:37] God's word if you're missing those three
[1:34:38] stones you'll end up with a six color
[1:34:40] rainbow which
[1:34:42] here we are
[1:34:46] but there's something that Lucifer does
[1:34:49] not have
[1:34:50] that you have
[1:34:52] and you wonder why how am I going to
[1:34:54] make it
[1:34:55] because it's in you
[1:34:57] there's something in you that he does
[1:35:00] not have we'll take a a few minutes on
[1:35:03] this the the seventh Stone which will be
[1:35:05] the first stone in the third row
[1:35:07] is the lager
[1:35:09] it's from the tribe of gath
[1:35:12] it's an amber color
[1:35:13] the tribe of God means a judge to be
[1:35:16] Vindicated which I found it pretty
[1:35:19] interesting that to be Vindicated means
[1:35:20] to be loosed
[1:35:23] all right
[1:35:26] the tribe of GAD represents overcoming
[1:35:28] power I know this is a well-taught
[1:35:30] church and you you probably know all
[1:35:32] this but the the tribe of God represents
[1:35:35] overcoming power so mark that down as
[1:35:38] something Satan cannot do he cannot have
[1:35:42] overcoming power now the interesting
[1:35:44] part about this seventh Stone The Lager
[1:35:47] is it's totally worthless you don't even
[1:35:49] recognize it as a little girl Stone
[1:35:51] until you put it under a fire and when
[1:35:54] you put it under a fire that amber light
[1:35:56] shoots a red light out of it and you
[1:35:58] recognize that's a liger Stone you put
[1:36:00] it over the fire and then the value
[1:36:02] comes to it
[1:36:05] you put a tribe believer under the fire
[1:36:07] and watch the value come to it you put a
[1:36:11] tribe God called son or daughter of God
[1:36:13] and watch the value come to him we may
[1:36:16] not look like much up here but you put
[1:36:18] me under a fire and watch the value come
[1:36:21] under it
[1:36:23] you put this church under a fire which I
[1:36:26] believe it's been and watch the power of
[1:36:29] God come out of it there's value in it
[1:36:31] but you've got to go through the fire
[1:36:34] you've got to go through the fire
[1:36:37] that's where your value comes from
[1:36:40] otherwise you're just a dormant Stone
[1:36:42] laying on a golden breastplate but when
[1:36:44] you get under the fire
[1:36:49] where the value comes from
[1:36:51] you might not ever recognize me to be
[1:36:53] nothing on this Earth but you watch and
[1:36:55] you watch when a Son of God is taken
[1:36:58] through a fiery trial you'll never look
[1:37:01] at that brother the same
[1:37:03] that's a real man of God I've seen him
[1:37:06] in the fire
[1:37:07] I've seen it when the doctors couldn't
[1:37:09] figure out what was going wrong I've
[1:37:11] seen him in the fire that's a real man
[1:37:13] of God because the value comes out under
[1:37:16] the trial
[1:37:19] that's somewhere Satan can't go
[1:37:22] he can't walk into the fire he doesn't
[1:37:26] have the material to do it doesn't have
[1:37:29] it he literally does not have the stone
[1:37:32] to walk into the fire
[1:37:34] not built for it
[1:37:36] but you are
[1:37:38] [Music]
[1:37:38] [Applause]
[1:37:44] a supernatural world
[1:37:47] maybe you don't see that with your
[1:37:48] carnal eye
[1:37:49] you don't see that value of red shining
[1:37:52] through but you see the spirit of God
[1:37:54] anointing that individual so how could
[1:37:56] they ever possibly keep going
[1:37:58] how could they walk through this fire
[1:37:59] because they have the seventh Stone
[1:38:03] they have the full package they're
[1:38:06] complete in him there's nowhere that
[1:38:09] they can't go in God's word it's all
[1:38:11] access pass you can go anywhere that
[1:38:15] your faith will allow you to go into
[1:38:16] this word anywhere including cancer
[1:38:19] being defeated anywhere including mind
[1:38:22] battles being defeated anywhere
[1:38:24] including depression being defeated you
[1:38:26] are called and anointed to walk there
[1:38:29] that's our commission to walk there
[1:38:32] to step into that as brother Isaac said
[1:38:34] but the value comes what looked like a
[1:38:37] worthless Stone becomes priceless
[1:38:41] when you put it in a fire I think of the
[1:38:43] three the three Hebrew children
[1:38:46] walking into a fire
[1:38:48] now we live in a supernatural world
[1:38:51] where we don't see
[1:38:53] their Spirits coming and their Spirits
[1:38:55] going
[1:38:56] the Angels here
[1:38:57] maybe we don't see him but we we know
[1:39:00] he's here
[1:39:01] but we also know there's sickness in the
[1:39:03] building
[1:39:04] now if it was easy as easy I know we got
[1:39:06] medical folk in here if it was easy as
[1:39:08] putting your your your your your broken
[1:39:10] arm under an x-ray and you and they say
[1:39:12] oh the Bone's broken there and we can
[1:39:14] work on that
[1:39:15] but we're not battling flesh
[1:39:18] and blood
[1:39:19] but spiritual principalities and powers
[1:39:22] in high places
[1:39:25] and so we we walk into the church house
[1:39:27] and maybe we don't even recognize it but
[1:39:29] there's a spirit that's been attacking
[1:39:31] us all day
[1:39:33] there's something that's been binding us
[1:39:35] maybe for 20 years
[1:39:37] maybe just this afternoon but there's
[1:39:40] something that's that's trying to take
[1:39:41] hold of you that you can't see if it was
[1:39:43] as easy as for C Aaron could take care
[1:39:45] of it he just knocked the guy out
[1:39:48] but we can't see it
[1:39:50] it's in another world
[1:39:53] right brother Brandon would explain it
[1:39:54] in a prayer line he would somebody would
[1:39:56] come through and he would say you have a
[1:39:58] deaf Spirit that's taking hold of your
[1:40:00] hearing it's put it's binding your
[1:40:03] hearing I see the spirit and it's
[1:40:04] wrapped around your hearing canal and
[1:40:07] that Spirit has to be removed in order
[1:40:09] for you to hear right so it's easy for
[1:40:11] us to see that's how that person's death
[1:40:12] is there's a there's a spirit a
[1:40:14] transparent band brother random called
[1:40:16] it that's cutting off the circulation to
[1:40:18] their hearing right and then another
[1:40:20] patient would come by and you say you're
[1:40:22] blind there's a there's a spirit that's
[1:40:24] bound or optic nerve and you can't see
[1:40:30] I believe many of us probably have
[1:40:31] transparent bands there's things
[1:40:33] affecting our lives that we try to get
[1:40:35] rid of and we try to figure out how to
[1:40:37] deal with and we've tried to figure out
[1:40:38] how to get rid of it and we can't see it
[1:40:41] and we don't know when it's coming we
[1:40:42] don't know when it's going and it comes
[1:40:44] and goes and it's a transparent band now
[1:40:45] if I put a band around my wrist like
[1:40:47] this and I put it real tight my fingers
[1:40:49] are going to get purple
[1:40:51] I'm gonna lose circulation to these
[1:40:52] fingers and they're going to become dead
[1:40:54] fingers they're going to be useless to
[1:40:57] me there's nothing I'm going to be able
[1:40:58] to do with them I'm not going to be able
[1:40:59] to feel them you ever you ever slept
[1:41:01] wrong in the bed and you wake up and
[1:41:02] your hands about useless because you you
[1:41:04] cut off the circulation right well
[1:41:06] that's what demons in this hour are
[1:41:08] trying to do to the Church of God is cut
[1:41:10] off the circulation the flow of life
[1:41:12] into into our rooms they're trying to
[1:41:15] cut that off but there's only one way to
[1:41:18] get rid of that band
[1:41:19] now where that patient stepped on the
[1:41:21] platform and they were deaf there was
[1:41:23] not brother Branham standing there but
[1:41:25] there was a pillar of fire standing
[1:41:27] there there was a fire between them and
[1:41:29] the end of the prayer line there was a
[1:41:31] fire between them and their healing
[1:41:33] there was a fire between them and total
[1:41:36] Victory you understand there's only one
[1:41:38] way to get rid of the transparent band
[1:41:40] in your life it's to walk in the fire
[1:41:42] right the three Hebrew children were
[1:41:45] taken to the fire and the King said take
[1:41:47] my mightiest men to bind them I want to
[1:41:50] make sure they don't get away but the
[1:41:52] devil's not built to go in the fire so
[1:41:55] that King lost seven of his mightiest
[1:41:57] men in that fire because he sent him to
[1:41:58] go ahead and keep charging them they
[1:42:00] melted in the fire
[1:42:02] you know the prophet taught us the only
[1:42:04] thing the fire did for those children
[1:42:06] was loose their bands
[1:42:08] the only thing the fire of God will do
[1:42:10] for you is set you free from complex the
[1:42:13] only thing the fire of God will do is
[1:42:15] fill you with the Holy Ghost the only
[1:42:17] thing the fire of God will do for you is
[1:42:19] heal you of cancer is heal you of
[1:42:22] diabetes this hill you have depression
[1:42:26] there's a fire between you and your
[1:42:28] healing
[1:42:29] [Applause]
[1:42:30] there's something in between your
[1:42:32] prodigal and coming home it's the fire
[1:42:34] of God
[1:42:35] [Applause]
[1:42:37] Daniel and the Lion's Den what kept
[1:42:39] those Lions away fire
[1:42:43] the devil is afraid of Fire
[1:42:48] why
[1:42:49] because he knows
[1:42:50] in the end it's the Lake of Fire
[1:42:54] there's nowhere in the scripture where
[1:42:56] the devil Walks Into Fire there's
[1:42:58] nowhere where a spirit can follow you
[1:43:00] when you're walking into a fire
[1:43:02] now you might think well I don't want to
[1:43:03] go through another trial don't get in
[1:43:05] the fire of God
[1:43:07] come underneath the pillar of fire
[1:43:09] surrendering to the message surrendering
[1:43:12] to this word not your theory not your
[1:43:14] idea but come underneath it where the
[1:43:16] impersonations cannot last
[1:43:19] now watch the pattern he says Judas
[1:43:21] Iscariot followed those same tracks he
[1:43:23] was justified by Believing on the Lord
[1:43:24] and then accept him as a personal savior
[1:43:26] I thought this was tremendous Judas
[1:43:28] received him as a personal savior he was
[1:43:31] Sanctified and give the power to cast
[1:43:33] out Spirits put his name on Lamb's Book
[1:43:34] of Life but when it come to Pentecost
[1:43:37] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:43:40] fullness of the word he showed his
[1:43:42] colors
[1:43:45] he couldn't produce the color he
[1:43:48] couldn't produce the rainbow that you
[1:43:49] can produce when it came down to
[1:43:52] Pentecost he could not produce what it
[1:43:55] took to cross over he could not produce
[1:43:58] what it took to take the promised land
[1:44:00] he couldn't do it it wasn't in him he
[1:44:03] didn't have it doesn't have the
[1:44:05] capability that's why I don't get caught
[1:44:07] up fighting with people that just don't
[1:44:09] have it
[1:44:11] there's only one message of the Holy
[1:44:13] Ghost it's moved forward that's what we
[1:44:15] should do is leave aside the fighting
[1:44:17] and we'll stand for the message and move
[1:44:20] forward
[1:44:23] they're just not built for it
[1:44:26] but I was
[1:44:28] I believe you were somebody say I was
[1:44:31] built for that fire
[1:44:33] it showed his true colors that's exactly
[1:44:35] what the Canaan spies did that's exactly
[1:44:38] what Esau done that's exactly what Satan
[1:44:41] done to Eve in the garden it showed
[1:44:43] their true colors I don't care Judas
[1:44:46] could have done all kinds of signs
[1:44:47] wonders but when he come to receive the
[1:44:49] holy ghost at the day of Pentecost he
[1:44:52] showed his colors the devil can come
[1:44:55] right up and impersonate right to the
[1:44:57] very thing till it comes to this word
[1:44:59] but he can't take all that word he can
[1:45:02] bring it all up maybe to one word like
[1:45:04] Eve the devil did to Eve but he can't
[1:45:06] cross it all
[1:45:08] because the whole thing is the body of
[1:45:10] Christ
[1:45:11] the whole thing
[1:45:13] complete in him
[1:45:15] you're not an impersonator you're the
[1:45:17] real one
[1:45:19] you're not the counterfeit you're the
[1:45:21] reality
[1:45:22] you're the one the counterfeit was spun
[1:45:24] off of you're the reality of it now that
[1:45:26] eight stone will try to hurry is the a
[1:45:28] gate
[1:45:29] that represents the Neftali tribe which
[1:45:32] means through difficulty
[1:45:34] it's a common Stone found out you might
[1:45:37] go find him out here just looks like any
[1:45:39] Old Stone until you cut it
[1:45:41] and when you cut it and you polish it it
[1:45:44] becomes a beautiful stone it becomes the
[1:45:46] stone we saw up there on the breastplate
[1:45:48] it becomes a beautiful thing that they
[1:45:49] might have value to it but it's got to
[1:45:51] be cut
[1:45:53] it's got to be fashioned it's got to be
[1:45:55] it's got to be molded and it's it's
[1:45:58] through difficulty
[1:46:00] that that Stone comes it's through the
[1:46:02] trial
[1:46:03] of our faith
[1:46:04] but when you have the stone you can go
[1:46:07] through the trial
[1:46:09] when you have that ingredient you're
[1:46:11] going through the track you're going to
[1:46:13] make it out on the other side it's
[1:46:15] through great difficulty but that's
[1:46:17] where Joe was when he recognized he had
[1:46:20] the third row when he said I was there
[1:46:23] I'm in the greatest trial of my life I
[1:46:26] don't know how I'm gonna make it out of
[1:46:27] this situation
[1:46:29] but I was there
[1:46:31] and if I was there I've got to go back
[1:46:34] to there if I was ever in the mind of
[1:46:37] God I've got to go back to the mind of
[1:46:39] God I was there not a fake but the real
[1:46:42] deal I was there
[1:46:45] when the sons of God
[1:46:46] me out for joy
[1:46:55] I was there when they said yeah
[1:47:00] friends there's too much scripture to
[1:47:03] come against the move of God
[1:47:05] there's too much scripture in here I'm
[1:47:07] not picking this I didn't just hot spot
[1:47:09] quotes but there's too much in here to
[1:47:11] come against the holy move of God
[1:47:14] there's just too much it's where God
[1:47:17] operates and you wonder why you can't
[1:47:19] keep your young people out of porn
[1:47:21] addictions and you can't keep your young
[1:47:23] people out of suicide and you can't keep
[1:47:25] your preachers from sitting on their
[1:47:27] wives and you can't keep your church
[1:47:28] together it's because you don't preach
[1:47:31] the Holy Ghost that will actually change
[1:47:34] the situation we have to have seminars
[1:47:36] on how to do it or some psychological
[1:47:38] approach preach the Holy Ghost
[1:47:41] it'll do the fixing
[1:47:44] you're never going to get this fixed on
[1:47:45] your own idea you would have fixed it
[1:47:47] already but the Holy Ghost when he comes
[1:47:49] he the spirit of Truth Shall lead you
[1:47:51] and guide you into all truth
[1:47:55] he's on the outside
[1:47:57] unfortunately of so-called message
[1:47:59] churches he's not welcome in their
[1:48:02] pulpit
[1:48:03] I thank God that there's still some
[1:48:05] pulpits today brother Tim
[1:48:07] I thank God for I got kids
[1:48:10] I got young ones coming up
[1:48:13] I have my
[1:48:14] experience but I got young ones coming
[1:48:16] up and I thank God that there has been
[1:48:18] pillars that have stood and have fought
[1:48:20] for what we believe in that have stood
[1:48:22] the time test that have students they've
[1:48:25] weathered the storm where I could bring
[1:48:27] my children into a sanctuary where they
[1:48:29] might be filled with the very spirit of
[1:48:31] God
[1:48:32] God forbid we ever remove that from our
[1:48:35] church God forbid we have to remove that
[1:48:37] for our home I don't care where we're at
[1:48:39] what we're doing what we're driving if
[1:48:40] God wants to come fill somebody I say
[1:48:43] let him fill them thank you
[1:48:47] we're way too late to be playing games
[1:48:51] but I canceled the to buy me gold
[1:48:54] that's been tried in the fire
[1:48:56] that's not just for everybody
[1:48:58] that's not just for the nominal world
[1:49:00] out there or everybody that looks on the
[1:49:02] name of Jesus but I counsel thee to buy
[1:49:04] of me gold
[1:49:06] that's been tried in the fire then if
[1:49:08] you are a son or daughter of God you
[1:49:10] were in God all the time somebody say
[1:49:12] all the time but he knew what bed and
[1:49:15] time that you would be planted so now
[1:49:17] you're made a creature a Son of God
[1:49:19] manifest his son or daughter of God to
[1:49:21] meet the challenge of the hour to
[1:49:24] vindicate the true and living God of
[1:49:26] this hour the message that's coming
[1:49:28] forth in this time
[1:49:30] you were predestinated to meet it that's
[1:49:33] right you were done there before the
[1:49:35] foundation of the world if you wasn't
[1:49:38] chose that way no matter how much you
[1:49:39] try to impersonate it you'll never make
[1:49:41] it how can you get blood from a turnip
[1:49:43] when there's no blood in there but we
[1:49:45] are not impersonating
[1:49:49] you're not impersonating
[1:49:51] you're the real deal Rebecca you're the
[1:49:54] real deal
[1:49:57] my gosh who is he preaching about
[1:50:00] well who's going to be the real deal
[1:50:02] who are we waiting on well one day
[1:50:05] that'll be okay in the short quick work
[1:50:07] we'll dance and Shout
[1:50:08] well where are we
[1:50:12] well who's going to fulfill it
[1:50:15] who's going to go out and come out of
[1:50:17] the highways and the byways you know
[1:50:18] sometimes we go through trials in our
[1:50:20] life that we don't even fathom why we
[1:50:22] could be going through it
[1:50:24] maybe this 2022 was just that year for
[1:50:26] you
[1:50:27] you thought that I'm going through a
[1:50:29] trial I don't know why in the world I'm
[1:50:30] going through it
[1:50:32] I don't know if I'll be able to come out
[1:50:33] on the other side I'm sure God has a
[1:50:36] purpose for it but God always has a
[1:50:38] purpose
[1:50:40] your footsteps are ordered
[1:50:43] as in you're walking in his will
[1:50:47] your footsteps are ordered of the Lord
[1:50:50] sometimes we go through trials
[1:50:52] I know we're over our time we've got a
[1:50:54] couple a lot more here but we'll just
[1:50:55] cut it out
[1:50:57] we go through trials that we we wonder
[1:50:59] wonder what's
[1:51:01] what's the point of this
[1:51:05] I remember back in the
[1:51:09] in the early spring of 2018.
[1:51:12] I got a phone call
[1:51:14] and I had lost somebody really close to
[1:51:16] me we talked to the phone every day
[1:51:20] every day
[1:51:21] he was living out trying to serve the
[1:51:23] Lord and doing his best I believe he he
[1:51:25] he had the revelation
[1:51:28] to be in the resurrection
[1:51:30] but he was taken home suddenly
[1:51:32] by by just an accident
[1:51:35] and I wondered what the Lord I said what
[1:51:37] what purpose could this be for
[1:51:40] what could this be for why
[1:51:43] why couldn't he just I couldn't just
[1:51:45] heal him
[1:51:46] why'd he have to let the accident happen
[1:51:49] well you know at that time I we were
[1:51:52] kind of living a little bit more
[1:51:53] isolated and I didn't really have a lot
[1:51:55] of phone calls and people to visit with
[1:51:56] the word about and and he was my buddy
[1:51:59] and we visited on the word and we talked
[1:52:00] about the scripture and we we made a
[1:52:02] bond that way and then one day he's just
[1:52:03] gone
[1:52:05] and I got to be honest I was I was not
[1:52:07] bitter but I was questioning the Lord
[1:52:09] are you sure this was correct
[1:52:11] I I guess that maybe he was going to
[1:52:14] fall away and maybe that that just there
[1:52:16] wasn't a place for him and that was the
[1:52:18] best way out of his situation that he
[1:52:20] was in maybe that was the best way
[1:52:25] but then at our youth camp two years ago
[1:52:28] I watched two young people come through
[1:52:30] that prayer line
[1:52:31] and the power of the Holy Ghost fall
[1:52:32] upon him
[1:52:33] and it all made sense to me brother l
[1:52:37] he had you in his mind
[1:52:43] he had you in his mind
[1:52:48] went to that Brother's funeral in the
[1:52:50] middle of Mississippi somewhere
[1:52:52] there were some folks from this trip but
[1:52:53] Jeff was there
[1:52:55] yes well it's sitting around the table
[1:52:58] over turkey necks and Hog's feet
[1:53:00] began to witness the message
[1:53:02] to a family
[1:53:05] where four souls might be saved
[1:53:08] God knows what he's doing
[1:53:13] God knows what he's doing Jay
[1:53:19] he'll bankrupt heaven
[1:53:22] to bring home your prodigal
[1:53:30] he'll pour out everything that he is
[1:53:33] to bring that down
[1:53:39] he's not lost his power
[1:53:41] he's not weak in his demonstration say
[1:53:44] well we haven't seen that in some time
[1:53:45] God's not lost his power
[1:53:48] he's still saving he's still going out
[1:53:51] in the highways and the byways and the
[1:53:53] bushes where nobody would go no church
[1:53:55] there in the middle of Mississippi God
[1:53:57] found a way to find the Sheep God always
[1:54:00] finds a way to find his sheep and he
[1:54:03] didn't bring you this far to leave you
[1:54:06] now but he's going to see it through God
[1:54:09] always finds a way
[1:54:13] he's not lost his mind he's not lost his
[1:54:16] power he's the same God that he was when
[1:54:20] he parted the sea he's the same God that
[1:54:23] he was when he walks on the water he's
[1:54:26] the same God when he said Lazarus come
[1:54:29] forth he's the same God when he says
[1:54:32] William broccoli come forth he's the
[1:54:35] same dog
[1:54:37] the same power it's the same mind doing
[1:54:40] the same work
[1:54:44] he's not lost him he's still gone
[1:54:48] but we've got to Humble ourselves to
[1:54:51] come under the word the last stone that
[1:54:54] he does not have is humility
[1:54:56] he's uncapable of becoming humble to the
[1:55:00] word
[1:55:01] I'm gonna finish right here he doesn't
[1:55:04] have it in him Cain did not have it in
[1:55:08] him to repent but the Zeal of our hour
[1:55:11] is to repent the Zeal of the laodicean
[1:55:15] church is to repent come back to the
[1:55:18] word come back to Pentecost get back to
[1:55:20] where the power of God is real we have
[1:55:23] it in us to be humble enough
[1:55:27] we'll be humble enough to believe a lie
[1:55:30] somebody tell you that you're ugly or
[1:55:32] you're never gonna make it or you're
[1:55:33] unsuccessful we'll believe that we'll
[1:55:35] humble ourselves down to that lie but
[1:55:39] what about the truth
[1:55:42] what about when God says there's an age
[1:55:45] of the overcomer
[1:55:47] what a church of laodicea I write to
[1:55:49] them that overcometh will I grant us sit
[1:55:52] with me
[1:55:52] [Applause]
[1:55:56] what about it
[1:55:58] will you humble yourself to that will
[1:56:01] you humble yourself to put this word in
[1:56:03] your mouth and speak it over your trial
[1:56:05] [Applause]
[1:56:07] I'm humble enough to say I speak victory
[1:56:14] put it in your mouth I don't know what
[1:56:17] it is I don't care what it is have the
[1:56:19] humility to come underneath the word and
[1:56:22] put it in your mouth and confess it let
[1:56:24] the stone fly
[1:56:26] the challenge of the hour has come to
[1:56:28] our door are we ready to meet the
[1:56:31] challenge
[1:56:32] [Applause]
[1:56:33] there's some old blinds saying hey is
[1:56:36] his theology makes sense he said we
[1:56:37] don't all have to be deemed crazy
[1:56:40] you just let one of you die and you come
[1:56:43] underneath me
[1:56:45] you just back up on that Holy Ghost
[1:56:46] Doctrine a little bit
[1:56:48] and I'll back off your church
[1:56:51] I'll back off the attacks you just back
[1:56:53] off on that dancing a little bit
[1:56:56] and I'll back off the Mind battles don't
[1:56:58] tell me he hasn't told you that
[1:57:02] the challenge of the hours here
[1:57:04] you just back up on on claiming your
[1:57:07] particle you don't want to scare them
[1:57:08] away
[1:57:11] there's a Goliath out there
[1:57:14] his theology makes sense
[1:57:16] well
[1:57:17] I'm caught in the in between maybe it's
[1:57:19] true maybe it's not if we have the
[1:57:21] humility to sit underneath a lie we
[1:57:24] ought to have the humility to come
[1:57:25] underneath the truth of the word and say
[1:57:28] that's false Doctrine
[1:57:30] say that so that's a Lucifer anointing
[1:57:33] coming into my life that's a transparent
[1:57:35] band that I need to burn off in the fire
[1:57:37] of God no messenger came in my day to
[1:57:40] tell me that I wasn't gonna make it no
[1:57:42] messenger came and lived a life above
[1:57:45] reproached to tell me that I just didn't
[1:57:48] have enough but when I
[1:57:51] gonna make it
[1:57:53] you've got the stones you've got the
[1:57:56] material it's in you to fulfill our
[1:57:58] righteousness
[1:58:01] in you
[1:58:04] or you just back up on preaching that no
[1:58:06] I don't think I will
[1:58:10] you just back up on having those tent
[1:58:12] revivals in those meetings and youth
[1:58:14] camps and where where people just read
[1:58:16] no I don't think I will
[1:58:18] [Applause]
[1:58:20] I don't think I'm gonna back down to no
[1:58:22] giant yeah come on he's a bluff
[1:58:25] he's got nothing
[1:58:27] I don't think I will back down I think
[1:58:30] I'll preach this harder than I've ever
[1:58:31] appreciated in my life I think if I have
[1:58:34] breath in my lungs I'm going to preach
[1:58:36] Liberation in the Church of God
[1:58:40] as long as I've got power in these lungs
[1:58:43] I will be found preaching freedom
[1:58:47] I don't think I'm gonna back up at all I
[1:58:50] say it's time to come totally under the
[1:58:52] humility of the word and say Lord do
[1:58:54] what you will with me if you never cause
[1:58:57] me to dance fine have you never cause me
[1:58:59] to speak in tongues fine if you never
[1:59:02] cause me to worship like I see others
[1:59:04] worshiping fine do whatever God puts on
[1:59:07] your heart to do
[1:59:08] [Applause]
[1:59:09] if God calls you to have a prophetic
[1:59:12] word
[1:59:12] God forbid us to hold it back
[1:59:15] if God called you to dance in the spirit
[1:59:17] under the anointing of the power of
[1:59:19] Liberation you go on ahead and dance
[1:59:24] if God calls you to let us scream out
[1:59:26] that lets the release out of your life

[2:00:42] and when we're done repenting that's
[2:00:44] where the power comes
[2:00:47] power is in humility if our music
[2:00:50] players would come
[2:00:53] if we can't humble ourselves to the word
[2:00:56] we'll never walk where he walked
[2:00:59] oh Lord
[2:01:02] if it be possible
[2:01:05] let this cup pass for me
[2:01:09] nevertheless Lord
[2:01:12] thy will be done
[2:01:14] thy will be done
[2:01:16] I wonder how many of us could say that
[2:01:17] with our hearts but I will be done
[2:01:20] Lord whatever you have your desire for
[2:01:23] me is
[2:01:24] I may not ever hold a microphone in my
[2:01:26] hand never step behind a Pulpit whatever
[2:01:28] your desire is for me Lord that's what I
[2:01:31] want to fulfill
[2:01:38] it's God's will that you walk in perfect
[2:01:40] hell
[2:01:42] it's God's will that you walk in the
[2:01:44] power of the Holy Ghost these are things
[2:01:46] we can just get right out of the way
[2:01:47] it's not God's will that you walk in
[2:01:50] defeat
[2:01:52] it's not God's intention that you walk
[2:01:55] wondering if I'm going to come in here

[2:02:14] walking in it brother Silas a year ago
[2:02:17] you couldn't say that but today you can
[2:02:19] say that why because there's a fire
[2:02:22] between you and your Victory and he was
[2:02:24] humble enough to come under that fire
[2:02:28] oh and if there's anybody near Humble
[2:02:30] enough to walk through the fire of God
[2:02:32] say I don't want to just be identified
[2:02:34] with it I want to be covered in it
[2:02:37] I don't want to just be labeled as and I
[2:02:39] want to be totally covered in it
[2:02:43] hard decisions are made
[2:02:46] but they're the direction of the Lord
[2:02:48] for the Jackson he's going to bless you
[2:02:52] friends I know you don't know me but I
[2:02:54] just I just do what the Lord tells me
[2:02:56] amen
