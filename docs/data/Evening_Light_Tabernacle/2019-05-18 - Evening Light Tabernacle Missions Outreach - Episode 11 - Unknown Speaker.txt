========================================

well hello everybody it's great to have you with us we are the ministry team of eaten in like tabernacle and we hope that you will invite friends to join with us today and let everybody know that we're we're on for another session tonight or today whatever time it would be as you're listening and so we welcome you to even ask questions by email or two if you something comes in your mind of your heart that you would kind of like to know more about this subject please do so let us know even by email or other ways to contact us where today we have been speaking in past sessions about the birth of the church and today we're going to be talking about the closing of the Gentile dispensation and the events that led up to the closing of the I'm sorry the Jewish dispensation and the closing of that and the Old Testament and bringing in a new covenant and so if this was a time period of course when there was a changing of dispensation a junction and we feel like that the ending of the Jewish dispensation is parallel to the ending of the Gentile dispensation so I think it's a great study how would you define dispensation brother Tim how would you well dispensation by definition is a divinely ordained the order prevailing at a particular period of time so for example the law was a dispensation that would cover a particular period of history where that God would use a nation to demonstrate what he would do in a new covenant when he would take a people for his namesake and so you know it's a dispensation a divinely ordained order prevailing at a particular period of history I see so there were there were times of judges there were times of kings there were times of the prophets the times of the law and these are times where God would do specific things down through the ages in specific ways for instance the law he's he's bringing something to Israel that is to the nation of Israel he built Israel then he brought them a law and then he's going to build this nation upon this law is this something that he is doing and under the umbrella of the dispensation of the law came the judges the Kings the prophets and so that were as it were many aspects of this dispensation and so you will find the same thing that happens similar in the Gentiles for example going from justification which would be a dispensation of a revelation divine order of knowing your sins are forgiven and a message come in as it did with Luther and then Wesley come in with sanctification and then on into [Music] Pentecost in the fulfillment right down to the rapture time you mentioned the judges and the prophets and the difference that but but never had there come a junction like this never had it come such a major turn a major event and you find in that time you mentioned how we feel like it parallels today and you see the troubles in the world today and you see the things going on around as a governments in turmoil and in every and there's just chaos in the world and if you look historically at that time period right there as Jesus is about to come on the scene you see the exact same thing in the world of that time with the Roman question the rebellions going on and historically it was a very time' it was an uproar everything was in chaos and you always see that happens at the time of a major event when God's about to do something Satan's tries to stir things up and there is there something that we can look and see like a sign of a change of a dispensation I mean I know we went you know from the law to what Jesus brought us to but like an angel or a pillar of fire or well I think always at a change of dispensation there's always a display of the supernatural I think it's very interesting from from Malachi the last prophet of the Old Testament to John the Baptist's which of course would come in the days of Jesus there was hardly anything that is recorded that God spoke during that period of years which perhaps was 500 or more years and so yet then all of a sudden an angel starts appearing first to Zechariah and then to Mary and then to Joseph in a dream and then the Shepherd's and then the wise men and then it's basically nothing that will happen for thirty years except for a tiny glimpse of Jesus life at the age of 12 when he was at the temple and then then there comes John the Baptist's out of the wilderness and then for a space of three and a half years more or less hundreds hundreds literally hundreds of scriptures or suddenly and rapidly fulfill wonderful but before that happened before you hit that I like how you said you know suddenly an angel appears so it wasn't that these things happen without any type of warning or without any type of warning may not be the right word but the angel came and that and let them know that something's about to take there's a turning of the corner they're not changing now God is moving you know brother Tim it's the similar in in the days of Moses because there was 400 years where the children of Israel was in bondage there was no miracle but the moment God was going to deliver them and change that dispensation an angel appeared on the scene and the miraculous began to happen and God began to speak and it was same with the 400 years of silence from the time of Malachi to the time of John the Baptist there was a changing of dispensation you can always expect the supernatural element to begin to work when something like this is about to take place yes and I think this is why today is a day of great miracles not days of miracles are past but days of mirrors are are prevalent and looking forward to and preparing for the greatest miracle which will be the change of our bodies the resurrection of the saints and and the glorious rapture they service the meeting in the air praise the Lord so the dispensation that took place at the closing of the Old Testament at the closing of the Jewish dispensation what were the changes that took place there there was a law an Old Covenant we moved to the New Covenant there was an old Lamb sacrificial lamb and imperfect lamb and it was fulfilled in the new in Christ what are what are some of the aspects of that change that we could visibly see there was a major corner turned there yeah it was it was very huge because actually as Aaron was asking you know well you know what things with was had happened or not just an angel appearing all of a sudden but no there had been years and years and years of prophecy and now there's layin in the Bible all of these prophecies like seeds waiting for the right atmosphere and the right season to come Poland for example um I would speak of an elijah prophet that would come to forerun the coming of the Messiah yes and it would like dormant in the scripture until all of a sudden light would shine right on that scripture and quicken that word for that moment so there were yes there was many many many prophecies laying there in the scripture that just needed to be ignited by the by the fire of God and and from there it was an explosion a little explosion of many many many scriptures fulfilled well even Isaiah when he said a virgin shall could say that was seven hundred years yes before and it just laid there you know just because it had laid there for hundreds of years that word was just waiting for the predestinated moment you know for a predestinated woman Mary for that that virgin to come on the scene and when the time came it was ready to take place and sometimes I think we get people get lulled to sleep Bible what's happening what's happening and it can all happen like that absolutely when the moment hits it's gonna just boom boom boom boom yeah it's going you know very quickly and rapidly like you said to went 400 years without seemingly anything happening Sammy back in Moses 400 years slaves yes and all of a sudden only Manhattan and it's just one thing after another being fulfilled and it was an exodus you know that took place in Moses as a day the exes it took place in Jesus wonder day and there's an exodus in this day so we we should also look and say hey maybe it seems like nothing's happening but things are happening past yeah there is actually in our day another explosion squadron taking place that has taken place where that light is coming up different promises of the word and so you know this is why you would say in Ephesians 1:10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of time so we come to a new dispensation and even in our day we're times have come to us for filming so we come to times of the Gentiles where that it is fulfilled the times of the church ages where they are coming to in the end you know the dispensation of grace actually will come down to its inward that he that has filled his filthy steel he that is holy is holy stream he that is righteous his righteous still so you know it comes down to a closing time and we are at a very pivotal time in world's history right now hey man you know I believe a lot of it has to do with the expectation of the people you find people in that era selling Moses the people were under that persecution and under their judgment for 400 years they knew there was a promise given to Abraham that your seeds gonna sojourn in a strange land so there has to be an expectation I'm gonna deliver even though I've seen you there and then you find even in John the Baptist when they came on the scene there was there was the word that was prophesied Isaiah a virgin sound shall conceive where was the expectation Mary didn't falter with the expectation she knew it was in the scripture being unto me what about us in this day that we see so much around us the time still types the same we find ourselves in a very dark hour but yet what is the expectation of the people there's a promise rapture that's right right talk about a dispensation of change what is the expectation of the church to receive that promise word yeah I mean we should be like Mary be it unto me according to that somebody's gonna fit the scripture yeah yet at the same time that there was an expectation among some because God always has somebody that's a witness exactly somebody that's gonna stand for right here isn't truth and have that holy expectation yeah but at the same time the you know at this dispensation and even with in the time of Moses there was a time of lukewarm exact where that in complacency were that the majority of Israel was was not under this expected even though they were groaning and travailing and yes desiring and hoping but yet there was still a luke oneness and and there was a man by the name of amram that began to cry out together yeah exactly you know far a delivery man and and so it would be to that family that would be born a messiah as it was you know a savior as it was a redeemer which a deliverer is is the better word and so you know this would this would give rise but I want you to notice that would come a time of after a silence that would become a time of of Great Awakening and then a little time of silence and then another time of awakening right even within the fulfillment yes yeah and so I think we should never let down on our guards they're good you know to to realize just because that we may go through a little small law in between the Moving's of God don't give up on the promise I'm saying exactly man yes I mean there was a law in the time of Moses from the time his birth so a great expectation and and then you know he rises up and you can imagine as they would talk about human what was going to happen in that time is you know here he is being trained by the Egyptians that you know you can imagine the excitement there's people were looking at that and then see it seem like all fall apart right that's right only forgot to pick it up again that is very when he's 80 years old and meet him was a pillar of fire and send him out hmm and so um the same thing would be here in and this God which God would appear by an angel to Zechariah and then then the to the Virgin Mary and then there would be that loll of years right the space of time would seem like nothing was until all of a sudden here comes John out you know preaching repentance and preparing the way for the coming of Messiah so just because there's ups and downs and laws and times of quietness and seem like we're godless silent does not mean at all gone silent God is right all the while and the thing is the people didn't see John we don't see what was going on with John but God was dealing with him the whole time preparing him yes right preparing him with the message to come out you know the way to prepare the way it to be a forerunner and let me ask for people listen we're talking about the end of a dispensation do we place it at a specific moment is there it ended as there at what moment does it begin to turn is it a gradual blinding tour to where the Jews begin you know was it like a moment we're okay no longer the Jews that they can't see the truth is it is it a moment or is it a gradual thing that took place no but was more gradual don't you think I believe it was gradual and it was on many levels politically religious spiritually on many levels as we see the first coming this is how we pick up for the second there's no record in the Bible that said that the first coming would be a mystery right but there is that the second will be the he'll come in this the thief in the night and if they missed it in the first they're certainly going to be people missed it in a second but the the first coming sets the stage to give us a pattern and we want if we study the political world as it was spoke of us in Daniel we see the religious theater as it were the stage that was set when Jesus arrived Jesus says it will repeat again and so I believe it was gradual and I believe that it was on many fronts that God had set the stage for this deliverer I guess a lot of the time or even most of time the religious people though were blah did not their own traditions buy their own histories because it's not that they couldn't see it all but Nicodemus come to says we know that that you're a teacher sent from God so they could see that yeah so they weren't completely blinded there was something that would not allow them to accept the fullness of that truth yes and was that is that their own teachings and their own stubbornness and their own traditions you know of their churches that was keeping them from accepting that Jesus said you by your tradition make the Word of God of none effect when they exalted the men's traditions over God's Word they were on their way out well you know we're living at another time in another junction of time and this is a time war that men's traditions are being have been given preeminence over God's Word and just like the Jews in that time took the oral traditions that was taught by the rabbis over the literal and written word of God even so today there has been many many traditions that have been set by the people and by theologians that men actually believe in more than they do the Word of God the written word of God and so again it always goes back to my church said this is what my church believes instead of what the Bible says but I believe it as the church returns back to the gospel again that there will be a people that will rise that will give the Word of God the proper place the headship and the preeminence in the church and god bless you folks we're so glad you joined with us today always invite your friends to come and and listen and be a part
