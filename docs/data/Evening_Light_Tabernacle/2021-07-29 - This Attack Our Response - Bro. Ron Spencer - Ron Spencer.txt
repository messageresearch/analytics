intervene for her tonight you know i i don't know about you but i'm tired of this devil tormenting the children of god tormenting us when we come to the house of god trying to put fear and every kind of thing in our mind and i believe there's a word against that and i believe god's here to move in our midst to move for these needs and and to stand against this thing because you know the prophet of god would say it he said when all hell turns loose all heaven turns loose with it so we're seeing hell but i'm looking for heaven amen for god to move for his children amen we have brother mickey king that's been battling cancer and we understand that he's had a stroke and just a real dire situation asked the lord to be merciful on his behalf sister margaret coleman was going with her two sons to visit her oldest son in the hospital and with their crazy restrictions and things they got going on they would only allow one person in at a time to the hospital and so brother ben went in there and while he was in there she had asked to use the restroom and they told her no you can't come in the hospital use the restroom go across the street to the restaurant and i'm just going to ask you what sense does that make but anyway she went across the road and fell and hit her head on the curb now she's in the er there in that hospital and and had some bleeding on the brain and so we're just asking the lord to be merciful on their behalf amen and so also we have sister barbara wrestler's niece beth ann from houston's working in the hospitals there and just having a hard time again with coving so we want to remember all of those that are having to be in those situations they got to be merciful and we got several nurses here and and people that works in hospitals here and we're just

god's got people all over the world that's that's got you back amen the prophet of god said we are the final voice to the final age so our voice means something it has power in it because it's not our words that we speak it's his words that we speak and so we want to take all these needs before the lord and ask god to come on the scene for the behalf of his children that's brother john andes to come and greet you into and to pray for these needs this evening let's pray together god bless you tonight we're here to support you and strengthen you just by our presence let you know that the love

to remind the devil it's not over it's not over i stand before the most powerful people in the earth greater than the angels that are in heaven people with checkbook authority people that know who they are regardless of what the enemy says or he does so this evening the i i went to the study this afternoon and i thought i would take a nap but he began to speak to me [Music] and he gave me some words i'd just like to share a few words with you this attack our response [Music] it's our turn he put a punch now we are going to respond amen now we're going to respond [Music] heroes respond god bless you god bless you if you will turn with me to isaiah chapter 59 for the theme of the service i'd like to say for with god nothing shall be impossible your situation may look impossible the one that we're facing with sister karen may look impossible but i want to remind you that about 13 to 14 years ago i was brain dead and they were going to harvest my organs in a few hours and god sent a general hallelujah and i woke up god's still the same god tonight he's not any different than when he walked to lazarus's grave and he called him by name and lazarus came from another dimension back and the next day they would be having dinner together and he would be sitting at the feet of jesus i want to remind you nothing is impossible with god isaiah chapter 59 in verse 1 behold the lord's hand is not shortened that he cannot save it cannot save neither here's ear heavy that it cannot hear and judgment is turned away backward and just to stand at the far off for truth is falling in the streets and and equity cannot enter yea truth faileth and he that departed from evil maketh himself up a prey and the lord saw it and it depleased him that there was no judgment and he saw that there was no man and wondered and there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness and it sustained him for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and he clad the zeal as a clothe according to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he shall repay recompense so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and from the glory of the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against it and the redeemer shall rise to zion and up upon them that turn transgression to jacob saith the lord as for me this is my covenant with with them saith the lord my spirit is upon thee and my words which i have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor thy s out of the mouth of thy seed seed saith the lord from henceforth forever you may be seated may the lord bless the reading of his word this evening the angel was standing with mary and the angel was commissioned to deliver a message and then mary said unto the angel how shall this be see and i know not a man and the angel answered and saith unto her the lord the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be borne of thee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age we're talking about impossibilities here and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren just reminding mary there's all kind of impossibilities around you for with god nothing shall be impossible today i would like to stand i'm not a lawyer but i'd like to stand as god's representative and make our case we've had an attack come upon us and it's come in a lot of different ways but we must respond to the attack are you with me if someone breaks in our home we must call the law make a response our responses sons and daughters of god we are here for a purpose god didn't just bring us here and have us to be born a certain day in a certain hour just to see if he could do it he's got a purpose in our lives and he places us here and there's no crisis that comes on you that he didn't see and he placed everything that that you need for this journey you're well taught everything that you need for you this journey is on the inside of you and he gave you a word that he don't have to amend today or update today he gave you a word that has everything that it's at your disposal to defeat every devil that's in hell i psalms chapter 42 and verse 1 the scripture says that god is our refuge and strength a present help in trouble therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea the waters thereof roar hallelujah and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof there is a river and streams where i shall be make glad in the city of god the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall help her listen these are god's words to me and you today god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall help her and that right early the heathen rage the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice the earth melted the lord of hosts is with us the lord of god of jacob is our refuge come behold the works of the lord what desolation desolations he hath made in the earth he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth he breaketh the bow and cut up the spear and sunday he burneth the chariot in the fire be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the heathen i will be exalted in the earth the lord of hosts is with us that's enough to shout about the rest of the evening the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge the scripture is is is with us even now no weapon that is formed against us shall prosper i want you to say that right now no weapon that is formed against us shall prosper the most supernatural thing about you is your tongue you have the power of the life and death inside of it you have the power of creativity of an atmosphere around you you can live in a world of negativity where you can live in a world positive filled with faith and take god in his words regardless of the circumstances that you're facing in the moment of the hour hallelujah and every tongue that shall rise against thee in the judgment thou shalt condemn philippians chapter 1 and verse 6 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ god is the kind of businessman that don't get halfway in your project and quit you will never find god running for cover hallelujah as i heard it one time if your god's not big enough try mine hallelujah philippians chapter 4 and verse 13 i can do all things through christ which strengthens me first peter chapter 4 and verse 12 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in as much as your partakers of christ sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also in exceedingly joy hallelujah ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord i do not want to be found weak [Applause] finally my brethren being strong in the lord and the power of his might and pull on the whole armor of god that you might be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and haven't done all to stand stand stand therefore satan ought to be getting nervous right now having your loins gird about with truth have it on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye may shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always prayer is a platonic bond against the devils of hell praying always with prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there and too with perseverance and supplication for all saints jude chapter 1 and verse 24 now unto him that is able to keep you from fallen when you're not keeping yourself he's keeping you brother on i feel like i've run out of strength not too it he's the one that's keeping you he has taken responsibility for you brother ron i feel like i can't hold on much longer don't fret you're not the one that's holding on he's holding on to you [Applause] i've been sick before but i made it i've been broke before but i made it i've been brokenhearted before and i made it i cried all night long but i made it i've been betrayed but i made it i've been lied on but i made it i've been destitute but i made it i've been rejected but i made it you're sitting here tonight and you've made it tell your neighbor i made it all right god gives us courage when we lack it he gives us courage he says be strong and of good courage we must remember that we're believers as we've heard our your pastor say our pastors say we do what believers do we believe we're god's sons we're god's daughters hallelujah we've been reminded almost every service of who we are and what we've been called for you ought to be able to stretch your shoulders back and say i am a son and daughter of god as it was sung leaning on the ever ever presses arms of jesus christ i want you to know that's where we're leaning tonight we fight we're not some dainty little army we're an invincible army satan attacks we will respond we're from the south south region of heaven we will respond we will fox i come from stonewall jackson era i want you to understand we will fight peter cartwright preached in our area and you remember what brother branham placed him in the greatest battle ever fought a man of courage he goes into a town to to to get it to have a meeting and when he's cleaning the building up and cleaning witness the bully of the town comes in and he tells him you're going to have a meeting here first of all you'll have to whip me he didn't back off he got down off of the ladder took his jacket off he said well that's what i'll do next then come on church christians we fight we don't back up nor do we back down we fight he shelters us under his wings i want to remind you he fights our battles he wins our wars we cast out satan out with the holy ghost boldness he authorizes us and empowers us to use the name of jesus christ for any need at any time at any place and then he asks us to believe speak it and believe it we take him in his word by the authority of casting out satan and reminding the devil of who we are we have been declared by an angel we have been declared by an angel an invincible army we have been declared by an angel an invincible army we're more than a church we're more than a people we're the manifested bride of jesus christ living on the earth in laodicea and we will overcome [Applause] hallelujah is that all right we've watched him as a healer we watch him as a warrior we are prepared if there's any body of believers that are prepared we are prepared we have been through battles before we have been in pits before brother ron that's pretty brave are you standing there with stage 4 cancer and going against an enemy let me just say i have already read the book whose report do we believe my condition was talked about in a cave and even that condition which says not even cancer will stand before you the scripture tells us when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord god response [Music] hallelujah when the enemy comes in like a flood god responds he moves on the scene brother ron it seems like a long time it seems like it's impossible don't you worry god's always on time hallelujah i don't know what your battle is tonight but god has a response for it i don't know where you are in the world tonight but god's got a response for your battle whether it's covet god's got a response for it whatever your situation satan's been fighting you to and fro wrestling you every way in the world trying to destroy your faith your joy let me just say god's got a response for [Applause] you let me just say this to you we refuse to retreat you've heard me as an audience never never never give up there's a song that says onward christian soldiers marching ass to war may not be politically correct but it's still true first john chapter 4 and verse 4 year of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world that little speck that's on the inside of you is greater than every devil that is in hell [Applause] so why should we let negative thoughts reign in our life hallelujah that little bitty spot why don't you just put your finger right up there that little bitty spot let's look at it and satan can make your goliath look so big but that little spot that god put in you he's got confidence that he'll see you through every battle of your life second corinthians chapter two and verse three and verse five he says not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god second corinthians chapter 12 and verse 9 and he sayeth unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather to glory and mine in pharmacy that the power of christ may rest upon me maybe you're getting weary i'm giving you god's great quote book now isaiah chapter 40 and verse 29 he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no no might he increases strength even the you shall feign and be weary and young men shall literally fall but they that wait upon the lord [Applause] hallelujah shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as an eagle they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint [Applause] first corinthians 15 verse 58 i'm i'm trying to stand still and trying to behave therefore my beloved brethren be you steadfast unmovable always abounded in the work of the lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the lord i want to remind you we serve a living god he is infinite he is infinite he is infinite he is eternal and if you're a part of god you are eternal as he is eternal he has never lost the case he has never been in a crisis he has never lied he has never failed and he's always on time he made one decision and he never has to change his mind about his word he is unlimited in his power [Applause] i want you to understand something about unlimited when he saves the worst sinner in the whole world it does not diminish his power one little iota when he heals the worst cancer patient when he heals sister karen it will not diminish his healing power one little line lord romans 8 and verse 28 is this okay and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love god to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for know them he also did predecimate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god be for us [Applause] who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things everything you need is at his disposal your lost children he still saves regardless of what that's what the doctor is saying about you he still heals this week we had two major appointments and had scans the doctor spent a little time with us and she's a wonderful doctor the head won and she brother tim's met her she said i said i just asked her what she thought where she thought we were she said we have you on the highest chemo that we can possibly give you you're taking that every day twice a day it's the highest chemo that we can give you she said you just stay the course your prayers are working hallelujah you're on an invincible team when the doctor says you're going to die walk with god whatever you do just keep walking with god hallelujah who shall separate us from the love of christ your tribulation distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril sword as it is written for thy sake we're killed all the day long and we're accounted as sheep for slaughter nay and all of these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded this is a man writing from prison for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels or principalities no powers no things present or things to come nor height nor debt or any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord hallelujah let me just share with you another statement be be still and know that i'm god i'm bigger than your problem i'm bigger than your circumstance i'm bigger than your situation this is not your battle you don't have to handle this this is god's battle and god will work it out all you have to do is be still and know that i am god brother branham said every every word of god is a seed and if that seed can be planted by the inexhaustible fountain of life which is christ the believer has to drink beyond his imagination drink and punch it out push out everything you have need of cause it's in you when you receive christ we're planted together in christ and he is the inexhaustible you talk about unlimited he is the inexhaustible fountain of life don't never be afraid to ask big things god wants you to ask big things he don't want you to be a petty juvenile he wants you to ask big things that your joy may be full then brother adam gives us an example could you imagine a little fish about that big way out you under the atlantic ocean say i better not drink just a little bit of this water i may run out nonsense could you imagine a little mouse about to bring down there being down there in the big there are the great big garners of egypt saying i just better eat two or grains a day because i might run out before summertime again that's nonsense if they had ten hundred thousand rats that size they'd never eat it up and they had billions times billions tons of them fish they'd never drink up that water how many times could we multiply you could never exhaust god in his powers in his mercies you don't have to beg god it's at your disposal he's the inexhaustible fountain of life drink drink drink drink hallelujah hallelujah giving satan a break to kind of catch his breath what about the power of your prayer what about the power of your prayer many times we send in prayer requests that we didn't pray for a lot of times we expect god to do things that we didn't ask for but you're a son of god and so you must exercise your rights more than entitlement you've got to exercise your rights you've got to pray and sometimes you've got to break beyond the realm of more than now i lay me down to sleep you've got to break into the realm of the spirit of prayer sometimes you come to church and you sit down and you're wore out and you're tired and you're just sitting there and you're thinking well i want to be entertained you got to break beyond the realm of even your flesh i'm beginning to worship the lord i didn't get out of anything out of service you didn't put nothing in come on church we come to church and we get into the spirit of the realm of church and we begin to pull on the word of god and all of a sudden god is at your house he's dealing with your need for the word is a discerner the thoughts of the heart and all of a sudden you're breaking through and the demons in your life is being defeated we do not have to negotiate with the devil and settle for less than what god has given to us we've come to do more than set on a pew and occupy the pew and say i'm here but we've come to have war we're in laodicea but we don't come here and say well i'm just going to be a lukewarm believer we're an overcomer and that's sometimes you got to wrestle hallelujah moses prayed and the greatest the greatest soldiers became fish food did you catch it moses prayed and the greatest army in the world became fish food daniel prayed and lines laid down and later would eat his adversaries elijah prayed and outran the greatest horses 40 miles you talking about a marathon runner prophet of god was the greatest olympian in history i'm paying attention to the olympics i want to tell you about an olympian a prophet of god he prayed and he outran the greatest horses of that day satan you know that's a truth jesus was up on the top of a mountain and he sat down and he rebuked him again with the word of god now he could have rebuked him with his power but he chose the word knowing that you were going to take some of the same scriptures that i have given to you tonight because that's god's word seed form it was a thought then it was a seed then it was in a prophet then he wrote it down and it doesn't have a time limitation to it and you can believe it but when it grows across your lips it goes into action hallelujah and he defeated satan with the word of god showing that the weakest of christian can defeat satan with thus saith the lord it is written it is written it is written david said this the lord is my shepherd and i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures and he leadeth me beside of the still waters and he restoreth my soul this is more than just a good song this got power in it and he leads with me in the past of righteousness for his name's sake and yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me listen god's always with you good times and in crisis by rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest the table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with all my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever he also writes in psalms 27 the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came up on me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fail those cancer devils we've got some testimonies all over this building those cancer devils has come up against you they stumbled and they fail it must be a mystery to a lot of people in the cancer center where i go i've been there a year and a half now i seem to get me getting stronger instead of getting weaker one of the doctors told me the other day the whole world was beginning to know about your case in the doctor community they're beginning to know about your case
