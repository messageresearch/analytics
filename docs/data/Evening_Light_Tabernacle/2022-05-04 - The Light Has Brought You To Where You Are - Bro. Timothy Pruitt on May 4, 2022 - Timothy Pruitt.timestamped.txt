[40:50] reading that brother branham would pull
[40:51] deep calleth to the deep from

[40:59] continuation of where we was last
[41:01] wednesday but the light has brought you
[41:04] to where you are amen the light has
[41:07] brought you to where you are
[41:09] amen so we we see here brother brown
[41:11] would talk about the deep that call us
[41:13] into the deep there has to be a deep to
[41:16] respond or there's something that draw
[41:18] there's a drawing power there's
[41:20] something that's pulling and and he
[41:22] would he would bring out the the man
[41:24] simeon there that sat in the temple and
[41:26] he had been given a revelation of god
[41:28] that to into his heart that he would not
[41:31] see death until he saw the christ and so
[41:34] he was there looking for that and he
[41:36] said he said he had that there laying
[41:38] there that promise that was in his heart
[41:41] and he said the holy spirit now we know
[41:43] the holy spirit is the the pillar of
[41:45] fire is the
[41:47] the logos the the the light of god the
[41:50] holy spirit has promised you something
[41:52] he says then you must expect him to back
[41:56] up what he said and to bring it to pass
[41:58] he says it's up to the holy spirit to
[42:01] see that you're led to it
[42:03] it's up to the holy spirit to see that
[42:06] you're led to it he says how many is
[42:08] expecting a revival he said well maybe
[42:10] this is the time he's led you to that
[42:13] you couldn't have that desire for
[42:15] revival unless there was revival to be
[42:18] had amen so and then and then if there's
[42:20] a promise of that a promise to you then
[42:23] the holy spirit is going to make sure
[42:25] that you're led to that place and to
[42:27] that spot amen he says how many have
[42:29] been expecting healing he says all right
[42:32] well there has to be a fountain open for
[42:35] your healing
[42:36] amen and then the holy spirit is there
[42:39] to make sure that you're led to where
[42:42] you need to be he says look david said
[42:44] when the deep calleth in the deep he
[42:46] said if there's a deep calling on the
[42:48] inside there's got to be a deep
[42:50] somewhere to respond to that call
[42:53] see what i mean he says how he says you
[42:55] know you
[42:56] said before there was a fish or a fin on
[42:58] a fish back there had to be water first
[43:00] for him to swim in or he would never had
[43:03] a fin before there would be a tree to
[43:05] grow in the earth there had to be earth
[43:07] first or there never would have been a
[43:09] tree to grow in it he said you know he
[43:11] talks about that little boy and we've
[43:13] heard the story about gnawing off the
[43:15] erasers and and school of his pencils
[43:17] and and he'd even gnaw off the pedals on
[43:19] his bicycle and they took him to doctors
[43:22] and clinics and blood tests and things
[43:24] and to check him out and they found out
[43:26] that there was something lacking in his
[43:28] body that his body was craving sulfur
[43:31] and and indians and there had there had
[43:33] been a
[43:34] sulfur a deficiency in his body and so
[43:37] that crave caused that caused the deep
[43:40] to call and he said only way that could
[43:42] be there there had to be sulfur to
[43:44] fulfill that call
[43:46] in other words there had there before
[43:47] there was a creation there had to be a
[43:49] creator to create the creation he said
[43:52] now if you're thirsting for more of god
[43:54] he says how many would like to have more
[43:56] of god
[43:57] he said this shows you there's more of
[44:00] god for you to have
[44:02] hallelujah amen so and so looking at
[44:06] that the light will lead you to the
[44:08] place that you need to be amen it says
[44:11] you so just as sure as you believe that
[44:13] there's that god is a healer there's a
[44:15] fountain open somewhere for that healing
[44:18] or you would never have that desire
[44:21] oh what a promise amen amen i cannot
[44:24] have a desire for healing unless there's
[44:26] a healing to be had and we know the
[44:28] promises of god are laying there in the
[44:30] bible for that therefore that bible is a
[44:33] fountain that's been opened amen a
[44:35] stream of life has been available for us
[44:38] and the holy spirit will make sure
[44:41] you're at the right place at the right
[44:42] time to receive that promise if that's
[44:45] what you're expecting to receive just
[44:47] like simon you know he
[44:49] no doubt maybe
[44:50] in his mind he thought well i'll just go
[44:52] back up there to the temple and thought
[44:53] it was just another day as usual but
[44:55] this was not just another day as usual
[44:57] this was the day that the messiah was
[44:59] going to come into the temple and so the
[45:02] light was making sure he was there to
[45:05] receive the promise
[45:07] hallelujah amen i i got to thinking
[45:09] about that as a as just one man but now
[45:12] there's a bride body here on the earth
[45:14] that's also looking for the return of
[45:16] the messiah amen you think it might be
[45:19] just another day as usual and things are
[45:21] going on and all kind of stuff is
[45:23] happening all stuff around us has fallen
[45:25] apart but the light is preparing you to
[45:28] receive the messiah the light is
[45:30] preparing you to receive amen the coming
[45:33] of the lord jesus christ otherwise if
[45:36] you we couldn't have that desire for the
[45:38] coming of the lord if there wasn't a
[45:39] coming of the lord amen there's
[45:41] something in us that's pulsating and
[45:43] pulling us to the place where we need to
[45:45] be amen he said the holy spirit is
[45:48] obligated it was obligated to lead simon
[45:52] to that place to that fountain he said
[45:55] if you're expecting it the holy spirit
[45:57] is obligated to lead you to the same
[46:00] place it's got to open up somewhere he
[46:03] said if you've got a burning desire in
[46:06] your heart the holy spirit is obligated
[46:09] to lead you to it
[46:11] right to the fount and filled with blood
[46:14] drawn from emmanuel's veins where
[46:16] sinners plunged beneath the flood and
[46:18] lose all their unbelief and their guilty
[46:20] state you want to be a place where you
[46:22] can surpass any doubt of your mind don't
[46:24] you don't want to be that way well
[46:26] there's a fountain somewhere that'll do
[46:28] it
[46:29] you're searching for it you're searching
[46:31] for it but there is a place that will
[46:34] fulfill that desire he said every
[46:36] promise in the book belongs to us so
[46:38] you're searching for it that if it was
[46:40] close to you and it was close to simeon
[46:43] it but it was the holy spirit's
[46:45] obligation to lead him to the place
[46:48] where christ was that's the holy
[46:50] spirit's obligation
[46:53] hallelujah so you're desiring something
[46:55] for god well the holy spirit's got a job

[46:59] to make sure that desire does not go

[47:10] deliverance whatever it is you have need
[47:12] of the holy ghost is obligated to lead
[47:15] you to the place the light of almighty
[47:17] god to lead you to the place where you
[47:20] can receive from the fountain of god he
[47:22] said if you believe in healing it's the
[47:24] holy spirit's obligation to lead you to
[47:28] that fountain you don't have to he said
[47:30] you don't have to get him but he will
[47:32] lead you up show you but if you're
[47:34] seeking it you'll get in
[47:36] if you're seeking the holy spirit and

[47:42] holy ghost if you'll just let him lead

[48:45] he has led you to the place that you can
[48:47] receive something from god amen he's led
[48:50] you to the place to where you can
[48:51] receive the truth of this hour amen your
[48:54] complex didn't lead you your doubts
[48:56] didn't lead you your fears didn't lead
[48:58] you the light of the holy ghost has led
[49:01] you to the place where you are
[49:04] [Applause]
[49:06] amen
[49:07] he says he walks over to this line of
[49:08] women he said it might have been two or
[49:10] three hundred standing there and i can
[49:12] see him walking the line and he was
[49:14] saying his heart lord you told me one
[49:17] day the holy ghost came upon me and made
[49:19] known many things you've never felt me i
[49:21] don't know what you want with me this
[49:23] morning but you just keep telling me to
[49:25] walk and i'm walking and after a while
[49:27] as soon as his eyes fell upon that
[49:29] little woman all them standing back like
[49:32] borderline believers you know standing
[49:34] back on the side days of miracles are
[49:36] passed and so forth you know to to a
[49:38] hungry heart that's been led by god you
[49:41] know where it's at when you find it you
[49:43] know they've arrived somewhere so simeon
[49:46] when he got up close to where that baby
[49:48] was i can just see that old sage and
[49:51] those big glistening tears start coming
[49:53] down his bearded cheeks and reach over
[49:55] and grab that baby in his arms and said
[49:57] oh what a feeling this is this morning
[50:00] lord now let that servant depart in
[50:02] peace according thy words for my eyes
[50:05] have seen thy salvation the very thing
[50:08] that everybody else was criticizing and
[50:10] making fun that's thy salvation
[50:15] let thy servant now depart in peace
[50:17] according to your word i'm ready to go
[50:20] now for my eyes have seen what you have
[50:23] brought me to see
[50:25] oh my way back over in the corner was
[50:27] another woman another little woman
[50:29] another woman a little woman named and
[50:31] and i believe it was and the spirit of
[50:32] the lord fell upon her blind as she can
[50:35] be but the light of god led her to where
[50:38] she could receive the promise
[50:40] hallelujah raise up and here she came
[50:43] through the temple blind physically but
[50:46] she could see a lot further than many of
[50:48] them standing there with good eyes
[50:51] hallelujah she could see greater things
[50:54] in them that could see with eyes they
[50:56] could see the walls they could see the
[50:57] floor they could see everything around
[50:59] it but that's not what she was looking
[51:01] at she was looking at that whirling ball
[51:04] of fire that was leading her to the
[51:06] promise
[51:08] hallelujah she came straight to where
[51:10] the baby was and she raised her up in
[51:12] her hands and blessed god and blessed
[51:15] mary and prophesied there before them
[51:17] that child would be for a fallen arising
[51:20] many in israel and the sword that would
[51:22] pierce the heart and how the prophets
[51:23] had said it take place and that old
[51:25] blind man could be a that old blind
[51:27] woman could be led to that spot without
[51:30] natural eyes that's what the holy ghost
[51:33] can do he can lead you to where you need
[51:36] to be
[51:38] hallelujah i remember another blind
[51:40] woman in our day there was a little
[51:42] blind black girl that was caught in a
[51:44] big crowd and she was crying out i want
[51:47] to see the healer i need my father
[51:50] crying out and crying out hey man
[51:51] brother branham had just come from a
[51:53] real miracle that taken place and he
[51:55] hears her cry and he said you know what
[51:57] i just kind of got over there and i
[51:59] stepped in her way on purpose
[52:03] i love that
[52:05] god knows how to get in your way on
[52:06] purpose
[52:08] he knows how to lead you to where you
[52:10] need to be
[52:11] you might be heading the wrong direction
[52:13] but he knows how to get in your way
[52:16] i saw he knew about it he was going the
[52:18] wrong way all the way down damascus
[52:20] gonna go persecute and pray and put him
[52:23] people in jail that was preaching the
[52:25] lord jesus christ and he was going the
[52:27] wrong direction but a light led him to
[52:30] where he needed to be
[52:32] hallelujah and this is where she was
[52:34] this little blind girl and she comes to
[52:36] a place she bumps up against the prophet
[52:39] and she begins to say something to him
[52:41] and he begins to talk to her and we know
[52:42] the story amen he begins to tell her who
[52:45] he is and she grabs a hold of him and
[52:48] she says i'm not going to let you go
[52:52] there was something in her that desired
[52:54] something
[52:55] and now she was at the place to where
[52:57] she would receive it and she wasn't
[52:59] going to miss her opportunity and she
[53:02] grabbed a hold of it and she said if
[53:03] you'll give me to the healer i'll find
[53:06] my daddy
[53:08] what was it it was the light and led her
[53:10] to this place
[53:12] a blind person
[53:18] a blind woman can be led to that spot
[53:20] without natural eyes to see that
[53:22] fountain filled with blood how much more
[53:24] ought to he
[53:26] ought he to be able to lead you tonight
[53:27] that's good got good sight to the cross
[53:30] that can see with your spiritual eyes
[53:32] don't look for the applause of the world
[53:34] you won't have it but be willing to
[53:36] sacrifice your precious everything to
[53:38] yours sacrifice it to the kingdom of god
[53:41] sacrifice your time for prayer sacrifice
[53:44] your life sacrifice your old card game
[53:46] sacrifice you put whatever you want to
[53:48] put there sacrifice all things of the
[53:50] world give it over to the devil
[53:54] i love that give it over to let him have
[53:57] it it belongs to him let's walk with
[53:59] jesus
[54:02] let's walk with the pillar of fire we
[54:04] are a people that are led by the pillar
[54:07] of fire
[54:12] listen it wasn't it wasn't moses's idea
[54:15] that was leading the children of israel
[54:17] down to the red sea it happened to be a
[54:19] pillar of fire that led them there
[54:22] and the pillar of fire never was lost
[54:26] he never took a wrong turn he never had
[54:29] to use his voice recalculating
[54:34] he was making every turn on purpose
[54:36] he was moving in every direction he
[54:38] moved on purpose he said i'm doing it
[54:40] for a reason because i want pharaoh to
[54:42] heart by his heart to harden i want him
[54:44] to say the children of israel entangled
[54:46] in the wilderness and he's going to come
[54:48] after you
[54:49] but it was the light that led them into
[54:51] the valley
[54:52] it was a light that led them to the
[54:54] place of pharaoh's destruction it was
[54:57] the light that led them there it wasn't
[54:59] their feelings amen if they went on
[55:01] their own feelings that it went back to
[55:02] egypt but they were following the light
[55:07] amen anyway you wonder why david think
[55:10] about this i was thinking about this
[55:11] other day as this thought began to come
[55:13] on my heart after i preached wednesday
[55:14] night on thursday began to think some of
[55:16] these thoughts
[55:18] actually texted them to a few friends
[55:19] and i said you know david got up that
[55:21] morning and he thought it was just
[55:22] another day
[55:24] thought there was nothing really maybe
[55:25] he knew there was a battle going on but
[55:27] he'd been tending father's sheep and his
[55:29] father got up and all of a sudden he had
[55:31] something come on his heart and said you
[55:32] know what get david and make a few
[55:35] things for his brother send him down
[55:36] there to the battle
[55:38] so they'll make sure they got something
[55:40] to eat on his mind it was nothing but
[55:42] just something to eat
[55:44] but if you'd have looked a little deeper
[55:46] than that and looked with some spiritual
[55:48] eyes there would have been a challenge
[55:49] that had been going on by the devil and
[55:52] listen now god hears every enemy's
[55:54] challenge
[55:56] he hears every enemy's challenge and
[55:59] he's willing to accept the challenge
[56:03] amen amen there was a pillar of fire
[56:06] that had been leaked listen they got
[56:07] into the promised land but that didn't
[56:09] mean the pillar of fire left
[56:11] it showed up many times through the
[56:13] bible amen it was there with manoa at
[56:17] the altar it was there with elijah it
[56:19] was there through many of the prophets
[56:20] and all the many judges you can read
[56:22] about the pillar of fire that was there
[56:24] amen i'm going to tell you it was there
[56:26] in that battle
[56:28] saw me and not a saw it his army
[56:30] apparently didn't see it amen but it
[56:33] began to draw
[56:35] it was standing there listening to that
[56:37] glass challenge and saying i got
[56:39] somebody here that's going to accept
[56:42] that challenge
[56:43] and it began to pull and it began to
[56:45] pull and it began to pull until they
[56:47] pulled a man out of bed and he said you
[56:49] know what i need to make some sandwiches
[56:51] i need to get some grapes together i
[56:52] need to get some milk put them in this
[56:54] david come over here take them down to
[56:56] your brothers
[56:58] but meanwhile david's thinking he's
[57:00] going down to just give some food but
[57:02] the light's pulling him to the valley
[57:05] the vow the light is pulling him to the
[57:08] place of death of goliath's destruction
[57:13] hallelujah amen don't you understand
[57:15] what has happened in this hour even the
[57:18] light visited this generation and it
[57:21] showed up and it has not left
[57:23] it's still among us it's still moving
[57:26] it's still healing it's still delivering
[57:29] it's still satisfied it's still filling
[57:31] with the holy ghost it has not left
[57:35] and it's whirling in the greatest
[57:37] darkest day there's ever been and it's
[57:40] saying i know i got somebody here that's
[57:42] gonna accept the challenge of this
[57:44] laodicean spirit and defy that thing and
[57:48] say i'm not bowing down to you
[57:56] we ought to have some idea tonight he
[57:58] said what the holy spirit is in
[58:00] operation what it should look like
[58:02] jesus described to us what the church of
[58:04] the living god would look like
[58:07] he said in my name
[58:08] they'll cast out devils
[58:11] check
[58:14] how many are witnesses
[58:17] amen they shall speak with new tongues
[58:21] check
[58:23] they shall take up serpents and drink
[58:25] anything it will not harm them check
[58:28] they shall lay hands upon the sick and
[58:31] they shall recover check
[58:35] the things that i do shall you do also
[58:38] check
[58:41] amen you'll know the thoughts of the
[58:43] heart and describe and discern and so
[58:45] forth check the word is still the
[58:47] discern of the thoughts and intents of
[58:49] the heart
[58:51] so when the deep call it's in the deep
[58:54] there's a deep call so there has to be a
[58:56] response it has to be something on the
[58:58] inside it has to be something there you
[59:01] wouldn't have that desire
[59:02] the creator has created it for you to be
[59:05] able to have that desire
[59:08] amen another place he says again about
[59:10] the fish he said god put a fin on him so
[59:12] he could swim in water but god had to
[59:14] there had to be water before they had
[59:16] ever put a fin on him
[59:18] before there could ever be a tree to
[59:20] grow there had to be earth
[59:22] amen it was a deep that has to be a deep
[59:25] call to the deep there has to be a light
[59:27] to lead the holy spirit he said he said
[59:30] you know divine healing let me go i
[59:32] think i doubled it here hold on a minute
[59:34] go on down
[59:36] but we see jesus
[59:38] coming to this moment
[59:40] and we find him at this place
[59:44] and simeon could have missed his moment
[59:47] anna could have missed a moment but the
[59:48] light wasn't going to let them
[59:51] and neither will he ever let his
[59:53] children miss their moment
[59:57] never
[1:00:04] he said i've seen
[1:00:06] he said i've seen
[1:00:07] wonderful things this is brother brad
[1:00:09] i'm against i've seen wonderful things
[1:00:10] of the light leading we know many of the
[1:00:12] stories i'm going to just go through a

[1:19:51] hallelujah i can see a little woman get
[1:19:53] on a camel load her goods on a camera
[1:19:56] and cross a desert through thieves
[1:19:58] across a desert through all kinds of
[1:19:59] problems and situations but there was a
[1:20:02] deep that called unto the deep it was a
[1:20:04] desire in her to see a living god
[1:20:07] it was a desire her to see something and
[1:20:10] he said there was something in her heart
[1:20:11] calling her
[1:20:13] what was it it was the light pulling her
[1:20:16] and bringing her to the place she could
[1:20:18] receive the promise
[1:20:22] there was a living god in action
[1:20:24] somewhere and she wanted to find it
[1:20:28] hallelujah
[1:20:30] david said when the deep calleth in the
[1:20:32] deep
[1:20:33] that the noise of our of your water
[1:20:35] spouts so there's any part of god in man
[1:20:39] the supernatural god begins to move
[1:20:41] something moves with him
[1:20:44] did you hear that
[1:20:47] it'll take him to it
[1:20:50] it can't help it
[1:20:53] david said as the heart longs for the
[1:20:56] water brooks so my soul thirsts us after
[1:20:58] thee o god the heart
[1:21:01] the deer has got to find the water brook
[1:21:04] or perish
[1:21:05] and if a man's got god in his heart he
[1:21:08] knows there's an open fountain somewhere
[1:21:11] he has to find it
[1:21:13] or perish
[1:21:14] he'll deny any creed
[1:21:17] any form
[1:21:18] anything else to find a drink
[1:21:21] of a true living god
[1:21:25] that's what starts real things moving
[1:21:30] the deep they call us in the deep now we
[1:21:32] know the story of a man
[1:21:36] who set an egg one time didn't have
[1:21:38] enough eggs under it for a setting
[1:21:41] so grabs them a duck egg
[1:21:44] she throw me a curve ball i thought you
[1:21:46] were going to say eagle egg well this is
[1:21:47] a duck egg story
[1:21:51] the duck egg
[1:21:54] when that little old duck hatched out he
[1:21:56] was the funniest looking thing them
[1:21:58] chickens had ever looked at
[1:22:00] his beak didn't look the same his feet
[1:22:02] didn't look the same his feathers didn't
[1:22:04] look the same
[1:22:05] his squeaker squawk or talk didn't
[1:22:09] wasn't the same
[1:22:10] they barked and he quack quack
[1:22:16] one of them picking on and said well he
[1:22:18] must be a holy roller with that long
[1:22:19] bill
[1:22:24] is the prophet's word i'm just
[1:22:26] quoting the prophet he must be a holy
[1:22:27] roller with that long bill
[1:22:30] what's that for
[1:22:31] why does he waddle when he walks
[1:22:38] he's a funny-looking thing
[1:22:46] no time to any age as any man or woman
[1:22:48] rose up in methodist baptist present
[1:22:50] presbyterian or anything else
[1:22:54] that really loved god and was on fire
[1:22:56] for god but what he was called an ugly
[1:22:58] duckling
[1:22:59] amongst a bunch of chickens
[1:23:05] the other thing that little duck out in
[1:23:06] the barnyard couldn't stand the scratch
[1:23:08] and then manure piles like them chickens
[1:23:10] dig did
[1:23:12] ducks got duck food chickens has chicken
[1:23:15] food
[1:23:17] you could teach that old dead theology
[1:23:19] we want to brother but something on the
[1:23:20] inside is beating
[1:23:22] for a true living god
[1:23:26] there's nothing else will satisfy it
[1:23:28] till that's
[1:23:30] quenched
[1:23:33] oh hen
[1:23:34] she would look at him
[1:23:36] clucking of the hen fold the little duck
[1:23:40] for a little bit but he got to realizing
[1:23:42] something's different here
[1:23:44] sounds different she'd go cluck cluck
[1:23:46] cluck and he'd go quack quack quack
[1:23:48] he didn't know that language
[1:23:51] he said a believer don't know that kind
[1:23:53] of language
[1:23:55] don't know the language of you know just
[1:23:56] shake hands and easy believism and just
[1:23:59] put your name on the book you have a
[1:24:01] ticket to heaven doug knows better than
[1:24:03] that
[1:24:04] a duck knows he's got to be born again
[1:24:08] he knows there's got to be something
[1:24:10] real but that little duck couldn't
[1:24:11] understand that they have a little soup
[1:24:13] supper you know and say well you come
[1:24:14] down there's going to be a good
[1:24:15] spiritual meeting tonight and go down
[1:24:17] there boil up some old rooster and sell
[1:24:18] them for 50 cents a plate to pay the
[1:24:20] preacher real duck don't get that that's
[1:24:22] still scratching in the manure pile like
[1:24:24] chickens do but the duck didn't eat like
[1:24:26] that first thing you know the old hen
[1:24:27] wandered off one day catching grass
[1:24:29] grasshoppers out behind the barn and
[1:24:31] field was hot
[1:24:33] it was hot
[1:24:35] it's about to be hot
[1:24:37] it was hot
[1:24:39] now you keep keep you keep
[1:24:41] you gave them some charge now you keep
[1:24:42] away from those holy roller meetings
[1:24:44] i'll take your name off of this book if
[1:24:46] you cooperate with that our church has
[1:24:48] nothing to do with that that ain't going
[1:24:50] to stop a duck
[1:24:51] first thing you know this little fella
[1:24:52] got up on the hillside
[1:24:54] and right down below that hill was a
[1:24:56] running stream of water
[1:24:58] and he heard something down there going
[1:25:00] quack quack quack
[1:25:02] he said wow that sounds like what i like
[1:25:04] that sounds pretty good and he raised up
[1:25:06] his little honker and he smelled that
[1:25:08] water brother it was born in him to love
[1:25:12] the water
[1:25:13] the whole whole hen cluck cluck cluck
[1:25:15] come back here and stuck up his little
[1:25:17] bill honk honk honk right straight to
[1:25:19] the water he went just as hard as he
[1:25:21] could go why he was a duck by nature and
[1:25:25] a man is a christian boy been been born
[1:25:28] in the spirit of god if he has been he
[1:25:30] hungers for the supernatural and the
[1:25:33] power of a living god
[1:25:36] as david said in days gone by when the
[1:25:39] deep call unto the deep there has to be
[1:25:41] a deep to respond amen there has to be
[1:25:44] something to quench that thirst or you
[1:25:46] will never
[1:25:50] you'll be so unsatisfied
[1:25:52] because there's nothing out there that's
[1:25:53] going to satisfy that thirst
[1:25:59] stagnant pool
[1:26:01] wouldn't really satisfy
[1:26:03] he wanted some living waters
[1:26:07] as long as a human
[1:26:09] being is searching and hungering and
[1:26:11] thirsting and calling for the power of
[1:26:14] god there's got to be a power of god to
[1:26:17] respond to it
[1:26:23] there's a deep
[1:26:24] that calls to the deep
[1:26:26] there's a light
[1:26:28] that has brought you to where you are
[1:26:31] many times we think the devil has done
[1:26:33] many things
[1:26:34] but god as i said god knows how to use
[1:26:36] storms
[1:26:38] the devil is never in control
[1:26:41] [Music]
[1:26:43] never
[1:26:44] can you say that with me never
[1:26:46] he's never in control so if he's doing
[1:26:48] something in your life
[1:26:50] it's god allowing it to happen to bring
[1:26:53] you to a certain part because he knows
[1:26:54] what it takes
[1:26:57] he knows exactly what it takes he knows
[1:26:59] exactly how to get you to the place he
[1:27:01] knows exactly if you're stubborn if
[1:27:03] you're hard headed if there's something
[1:27:05] in you if you've got a sweet nature a
[1:27:07] harder nature he knows all about you
[1:27:10] therefore he knows exactly what tool to
[1:27:12] use to get you to the place where you
[1:27:14] can receive something from
[1:27:16] him the light has brought you
[1:27:20] to where you are
[1:27:23] quit giving depression the credit
[1:27:26] quit giving sin the credit
[1:27:28] quit giving anything in this world to
[1:27:30] credit there's only one thing that's
[1:27:32] brought you to the place you are right
[1:27:35] now
[1:27:36] and that's the light
[1:27:41] now we see the world
[1:27:43] they're being pulled by darkness
[1:27:46] and i might i don't i purposely have
[1:27:49] left darkness out of this
[1:27:51] because i'm not interested in darkness
[1:27:55] i'm only interested in the light
[1:27:58] because dark
[1:27:59] he said the prince of this world has
[1:28:01] come but he has no place in me
[1:28:04] he has no pull over my life
[1:28:07] he has no he can fulfill no desire in me
[1:28:10] because there's a light that has brought
[1:28:13] me to where i'm at
[1:28:15] then don't you know if the light has
[1:28:17] brought you to where you're at
[1:28:19] there's nothing that can stop you
[1:28:24] there's nothing that can stop you i i've
[1:28:26] just this i flipped my bible over in the
[1:28:28] back and i just want to bring this
[1:28:29] because i preached on this before but
[1:28:30] this resonated it because this light
[1:28:33] is drawing us
[1:28:35] not just to laodicea that's not his
[1:28:37] fulfillment
[1:28:39] not just to your death or to a casket
[1:28:43] that's not the fulfillment
[1:28:45] the light is drawing a body to a body
[1:28:48] change
[1:28:50] and the light is going to draw bodies
[1:28:52] out of the earth
[1:28:54] to stand back up again in the
[1:28:56] resurrection
[1:29:02] david one time was surrounded by a bunch
[1:29:04] of philistines
[1:29:05] and it seemed like the philistines was
[1:29:07] going to beat him and this in first
[1:29:09] chronicles 14 and verse 15 or verse 14
[1:29:13] it says therefore david inquired again
[1:29:14] of the lord and god said go not up after
[1:29:16] them turn away from them and come over
[1:29:19] upon them under against the mulberry
[1:29:21] tree
[1:29:24] and thou shall be when thou shalt hear
[1:29:27] a sound of a going
[1:29:31] what was it it was the pillar of fire
[1:29:33] that began to whirl in the mulberry tree
[1:29:36] it began to whirl i said i you know that
[1:29:39] ain't the way to go if you go that way
[1:29:40] you're going to be destroyed but i got a
[1:29:41] way that you can come and you're going
[1:29:43] to defeat your enemy
[1:29:45] i'm going to bring you to a place and
[1:29:47] when you hear this sound i want you to
[1:29:49] get up and go after them and he said the
[1:29:52] sound will go in the top of the mulberry
[1:29:54] trees then thou shalt go out to battle
[1:29:57] for the lord god has gone before thee to
[1:30:00] smite the host of the philistines
[1:30:03] and david therefore did as god commanded
[1:30:05] them and they smoked the hosts of the
[1:30:07] philistines from geboin unto gazir and
[1:30:10] the fame of david went out into all the
[1:30:12] lands and the lord brought the fear of
[1:30:14] him upon all the nations
[1:30:16] hallelujah this is why it's important we
[1:30:19] don't move unless the pillar of fire
[1:30:21] moves but when the pillar of fire is
[1:30:23] moving we better move
[1:30:25] we better follow after that pillar of
[1:30:27] fire with everything this guy we got in
[1:30:29] it it might seem like it took her down a
[1:30:31] dirt road and down an off-beaten path
[1:30:33] but it has never been lost it's never
[1:30:35] been turned around it's never made a
[1:30:37] wrong choice it's never went a wrong
[1:30:39] direction it's never had to turn around
[1:30:42] say i was wrong it never had to say
[1:30:44] whoops i didn't know that they'd moved
[1:30:45] to that address oops i didn't know they
[1:30:47] didn't have that anymore oops i didn't
[1:30:49] know that though the holy spirit is up
[1:30:51] to date and current and he knows your
[1:30:53] situation he knows your struggles he
[1:30:56] knows exactly where you're at you just
[1:30:58] keep walking you keep following the
[1:31:00] pillar of fire because this pillar of
[1:31:02] fire is not there for your defeat it is
[1:31:04] there for your victory and it's going to
[1:31:06] lead us out of this whole world into a
[1:31:10] new body
[1:31:14] can you hear the sound of it going
[1:31:18] the pinna fire is not here to stay and
[1:31:21] to keep us here is to lead us out of
[1:31:24] here
[1:31:25] and we're going to defeat every enemy on
[1:31:27] the way
[1:31:28] let's stand our feet and rejoice in the
[1:31:30] things of the lord
[1:31:35] the light has brought you here
[1:31:39] the light has brought you here
