[0:01] [music]
[0:08] Oh yes, I'm running.
[0:11] Oh yes, I'm running.
[0:14] Well, I'm [music and singing] running
[0:16] the race of my life.
[0:20] I got to meet that chariot [music] of
[0:23] fire. Take my flight into the sky. I'm
[0:27] running. [singing]
[0:28] I'm running for my life.
[0:31] Well, now I'm in a race
[0:34] [music] to the rapture.
[0:37] Oh yes, I've crossed that old Jordan
[0:41] [music] River.
[0:43] And now I'm running to Canaan. I'm in
[0:46] the [music and singing] stature of a
[0:47] perfect man. I'm like a fountain waiting
[0:50] for directly.
[0:53] Oh yes, I'm running.
[0:56] Praise God. I'm running.
[0:59] Oh, [music and singing] I'm running the
[1:01] race of my life.
[1:04] I [music] got to beat that cherry on
[1:06] [singing] fire. Take my flight into the
[1:09] sky. So, I'm running.
[1:12] [music and singing] I'm running for my
[1:13] life. Well, now I say doubt
[1:18] and unbelief.
[1:20] You know, they were blazing [music] down
[1:22] that trail ahead of me.
[1:26] But now I've [music] laid these weights
[1:28] aside by faith. I've got to get that
[1:31] right. So now I'm running. I'm running
[1:34] for my [music] life. Well, now I say
[1:37] down
[1:39] and unbelief.
[1:42] [music] Oh, they [singing] were heavy
[1:43] burners holding down my feet. Oh, but
[1:48] [music] I laid these weights aside by
[1:50] faith. I've got to get that right. And
[1:53] now I'm running. I'm running for my
[1:56] life. [music] Well, now I see faith,
[2:00] hope, and charity. [music]
[2:03] Oh, they were blazing down [singing]
[2:05] that trail ahead of me. [music]
[2:08] Oh, but I caught them on the seventh.
[2:11] God put all things [music] under my
[2:13] feet. That's why I'm running. I'm
[2:16] running for my life. [music]
[2:18] Oh yes, I'm running.
[2:21] Thank God I'm running.
[2:24] Oh saints, I'm [music] running the race
[2:27] of my life. I've got to beat that cherry
[2:31] on fire. [music] Take my flight into the
[2:34] sky. While I'm running, I'm running for
[2:38] my life. Now it's [music] in that
[2:41] chamber
[2:42] of the pyramid. You in there with me?
[2:45] [music] It's in that secret place of my
[2:48] Jesus. That's where I did. Don't you
[2:51] see? He gave me the sneak preview and he
[2:53] told me I want to be Joseph. But now I'm
[2:56] [music] running. I'm running for my
[2:59] life. Well, [music and singing] and
[3:01] pretty soon that chariot will swing low.
[3:06] And when I hear [music] that trumpet
[3:08] sound, saints, I got to go.
[3:11] Well, I got [music] to hurry. I can't be
[3:14] late. All my stuff's waiting at the B.
[3:17] And now I'm [music] running. I'm running
[3:20] for my life. Oh yes, I'm [music]
[3:23] running.
[3:24] Praise God. I'm running.

[3:34] on fire. Take my flight to the sky.
[3:38] [music]
[3:38] I'm running. I'm running for my life.
[3:43] Now I'm saying [music]
[3:45] Satan, you got to shout.
[3:48] Don't you know those seven thunder they
[3:50] [music] sounded and brought you out?
[3:53] And now my destiny's been revealed. I've
[3:56] heard my name and I know I'm [music] s.
[3:59] That's why I'm running. I'm running for
[4:02] my life. Well, now [music] I've got to
[4:05] sing something. You got to shout.

[4:11] sounded and brought you out.
[4:14] And now my destiny's been revealed. I've
[4:17] heard my name and I know I feel. That's
[4:20] [music] why I'm running. I'm running for
[4:22] my life. Run with me. Praise [music]
[4:25] God. I'm running.
