would love to had every one of you there but you know don't have a place big enough to do it unless we had it here but uh you were with your family so we appreciated that and thank you for your well wishes and your love to us amen yesterday we had a special service for a um a family friend of mine um schoolmate Belinda herd Jones and um that was brother Tim winer's mother-in-law of course you know Sister Angie's mother sister Alicia's mother grandmother to a number of the families here um she didn't come to church here but you know she she did um come to some of our events and things that we had and sometimes a baby dedication but anyway um we were able just to go and minister to the family and and meet different friends some of their some of the classmates was there that she went to school with that I went to school with I don't know what happened you know it was just like that and now they are old people I don't know I'm not I you know I'm unchanged surely I you know know but anyway yeah we're grandfathers now and great-grandfathers time moves on but Jesus never fails amen amen one of my classmates is here today David Tyler we welcome you today glad for you to be here with us and uh zann I know you've been trying to get him to come to church we went to school with Zayn as well he was a great or two older than me but oh my what a pleasure it was one day to to to baptize him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and see the Holy Spirit get a hold of his life and Beth also and we're so thankful to God for his goodness in our lives amen when we count and we look and we count our blessings and we we can't say enough how great a God he is how wonderful he's been to us let's turn to Zechariah Chapter 4 and we're going to look at verse 6 and for those of you that are not familiar with our services here we we um we start at 11: on Sundays and and uh well we just have church you know um rather than coming back for a second service we we just hit the U hit the iron while it's hot and so um you know we kind of combin the the Sunday morning Sunday night service together so it's a little longer suong service a little longer preaching you're not used to that well it's okay you'll you'll survive amen you'll be and I hope that you'll be blessed amen but Zechariah 4 and verse 6 and then he answered and spake to me saying this is the word of the Lord and the zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it amen I'm going to let you be seated as you turn to Revelation chapter 10 and we're going to read from the first verse Revelation chap 10 and verse one and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open if you notice Revelation 5 you would find that the book was closed and it was sealed with Seven Seals and yet now it is a book that is open and he set his right foot upon the SE and his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he cried seven Thunders uttered their voices now these are all mysterious symbols because the Book of Revelation is a symbolic book and so it was written in parabolic form because God held the people in other ages blind to it until our day that we're living in when it would become a very important part of the scripture because it would be made known in the last days concerning the meanings of these things and so a thunder is simply the voice of God When God Says something and he doesn't want it known yet so it is recorded in the scripture as a thunder and when you look over in the the gospels when Jesus Remember say said um um he said oh Father glorify thy name the Bible said some heard of Thunders but what it was was a voice as the scripture said a voice that says I have glorified it and will glorify it again so you see it was something that to some it was a thunder it was just a noise but to others it was made known so it was a known voice so a thunder is a voice of God when God says something but it isn't time yet for it to be made known but I want you to notice as he said seal up the things which the seven Thunders utter right them not verse four verse 5 and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and he swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that are therein and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time time no longer so there would be a time this would be silenced but there would be a time where there would no longer be a delay to the know knowing of this to to the understanding of this mystery so he said um but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin the sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake un me again saying go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth as sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I'd eaten it my belly was bitter and he said said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings so you know we're looking here in a passage of scripture as I said that is that is mostly symbolic and of course it's something maybe argued and about and and debated on as to the meanings of it and maybe to many as many as much it's very ambiguous and unclear and but it it is something that is written in the word of God God and I believe there are things that we can receive from it today now last Sunday I spoke on by my spirit sayith the Lord which refers to Zechariah Chapter 4's prophecy and that that compares with Revelation 1 which are the seven golden lampstands that received their oil from the two olive trees by the side and of course it had a practical application in the days of Zachariah but it also was picked up in the Book of Revelation and shows it was Christ in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks is said in the King James version seven lampstands in other words that that were lit there originally from the fire of God from the altar of God it would always be lit from the from the fire that came down from heaven and then lit one lap then the next and would lit from the next to the next to the next to the next to the last and it represents seven lampstands represents Seven Ages of which God would do a great work upon the earth now he would hold this blind to the people of the first age because he did not want them to know the revelation of his coming you see if he had told them back in that age it's going to be Seven Ages or 2,000 years before I return then nobody would have died prepared everybody had been dilatory and waiting the gospel would not be spread and it would not go out so God would hold the secret of his coming until the last day and remember it is a mystery because Paul said behold I show you a mystery and so again we it would be reserved unto a latter time this is why these seven Thunders would be spoken but yet remain clouded ambiguous sealed up unclear until the days of the of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound his message then the mystery of God would be finished so now when we consider this we also can take in consideration the coming of the holy spirit that happened on the day of Pentecost this is found in Acts chapter 2 and yet it was the coming of Christ because of the Bible said if you have not the spirit of Christ you are none of his so it was the very Spirit of Christ the very anointing that was upon him the very life of of God coming down there in spirit form it was the Holy Spirit and and Peter when it came down he said this is that which the prophet Joel spoke of and revers to word being expressed and revealed so I want you to know notice it was not it was not just a an emotion that came down it was not just a shouting that come down though that happened there it was not even gifts of the Spirit such as tongues that was displayed it was the person himself coming down and we want to understand when the spirit comes he is also the word because you cannot separate the word from the spirit now so this is why that Joel said what are you seeing I mean Peter said what you're seeing is what Joel said what the Bible said what the word said this is the word coming down this is the message being revealed so here he would say this is that and refers to the word being expressed thus revealed because we must not only have Spirit we must also have truth amen you see you really can't have one without the other because they are one and the same this is why that Peter said of the spirit it's the word of Joel chapter 2 coming down you know that though he said in the last days in the last 2,000 years notice plural last days I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and my sons and daughters shall prophesy and so the book of Acts Peter would listen Peter specifically references Joel 2 but acts chap 2 and verse 40 says and with many other words did he testify and exhort so we don't have the complete sermon of Peter here do we amen here he preaches and and he has many other words yeah he he preaches this is that and it begins with Joel and words that are being revealed and and made known by manifestation and he says this is that but now there are many other things because you see in the Old Testament there were many references to the coming of the Holy Spirit many references and yet they were were not comprehending it they were not understanding it because to them to the Jewish people one birth was important that was be born of the lineage of Abraham you were in or you were out because of your birth right amen so there there again this is what they look for this birth births me into the Covenant but you see they they did not look for another birth and there was no new birth in the Old Testament amen there was this was a the first doctrine that Jesus preached was you must be born again this is his very first teaching he comes right out of the right out of the box as it was coming out and says here it is you must be born again he's talking to a Master a teacher in Israel Nicodemus and he says what do you mean I got to go back to my mother's womb you see they took everything literally it would be a literal L it would be a literal blood it would be a literal Sac Sabbath all everything of the Lord was literal but you see when when it was here in the New Testament Peter would take and Paul would take the the those things that have been applied literally and show its fulfillment in the New Covenant and so here again there was no nothing that could change the nature of man in the old Covenant the blood of bulls and goats could not take away sin it would take a greater blood than that amen and it wouldn't be I'm just a man's blood because one every man was born in sin like the other so what did God do God made his own blood amen he you see he created a blood cell in the womb of Mary now I want you to get something he wasn't H it was not half you and half Gentile it wasn't half half half man and half God it was God God became flesh God created a blood cell and there there in Mary's womb dust was wrapped around the blood cell and out of that came Jesus Christ the word made flesh now from him would come would as the second Adam would come a whole new creation you see if you're just born of the first creation you're lost you must be of the new creation and it requires a new birth in order for you to be birthed into this you you can't do it by joining you can't join a church and be be in the body come on Amen you you can't you can't say A you know a a catechism and make a make a profession of this or that one way that is by birth and the only way that that birth can come is that the old life of sin die in order to be born again now so as I said there were many things that he could that we could reference you know that um of scriptures of the Old Testament that was pointing to this but again the Jewish people were on a literal law think about this for a moment here on Mount Si this was the first Pentecost it was 50 days 7even weeks after leaving Egypt and they come to Mount Si and at Mount Si they have their first Pentecost or their first 50 day it was their Jubilee it's go be a celebration and there God would give his law and write it in stone amen take his finger and write it in stone so now then you then you come down to through that and look at it real close and we see there were 3,000 died immediately after the law was given because the law can only condemn you it tells you what you did wrong it tells you what displaces God but it doesn't give you the power to live it so here Thou shalt and thou shalt not and thou shalt and thou shalt not and nobody everybody hears it and say we're going to do it and we can't because to offend in one point is guilty of all amen so you see here here again it was it would Paul would call it the law of death because it could not lead you to life but it was as he said a school master or a tutor to lead us or to keep the Jewish people until Christ came because we were going to need a virgin come on someone who didn't know a man so there had been laws and mandates that are put into place to produce a Godly race of people so that out of that would come a messiah now as we would look at this for a moment and there's there's a lot of little trails that we could go there but let's kind of focus in I you know I'm I'm going to take this over to Ezekiel 36 and we're going to look about um I think tell you what I only got 36 in my notes here but let's go to about verse 24 on the screen let me see where we're at Ezekiel if you will all right for I will gather you from among the Heathen and I will gather you out of all your out of all countries and will bring you into your own land now in the days of Ezekiel the the the Jewish people had been exiled down into Babylon and so here God is said I'm going to gather you from the Heathen and I'm going to bring you back into your own land now of course this this is a great prophecy not only of the Jewish people but also of the end time because God is gathering a people as he as we saw you must prophesy again to every Kindred Nation tongue and people so God has a people I'll take you from among the Heathen gather you out of all countries and I'll bring you into your own land I'm going to bring you back to the land of the Bible oh what a land that is amen can you imagine being restored back to the land of the Apostle Paul the Apostle Peter to the land of Jesus where the prophets walk down Through the Ages come on church I'm going to I'm going to restore you back gather you out of all your country and I'll bring you to your own land next verse please notice and then I will sprinkle clean water upon you if you go to the New Testament he said what will I do I'll wash you by the washing of the water of the word because he said I'm going to have a glorious Church Without spider wrinkle amen or any such thing I'm going to wipe away but I'm to do it I'm going to have to SP sprinkle clean water upon you I'm going to wash you by the washing of the Water by the word hallelujah and you shall be clean somebody ought to shout right there amen sinful man being washed made clean Sanctified wash purified by the word of God that's what the word is to do to you amen is not just to go in your memory it's not just to it's not just to Adorn a plaque in your house it is to sanctify and cleanse the people from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you now I'm I'm reading your scriptures that Peter possibly could have referred to because right here he could say look here's where I where you've been brought you have been brought back to the land you've returned here for a purpose the purpose is to see the Messiah and this is a reason that you have come you've been gathered out of the Nations Amen to to get ready for the coming of the Messiah and he said I'll sprinkle This Clean Water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness from all your Idols will I cleanse you next verse a new heart will I I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I'll take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I'll give you a heart of Flesh listen the heart you got now is Stony it's resisted go it resists God remember Malachi 4 said that he would turn the heart of the children back to the faith of the fathers so you know it it's kind of like this when you were born you were born with as a magnet with two poles and you were born with with you know with one pole that resist and another that attracts and because of sin your heart was turned wrong you were born in sin as David was saying and I'm combining scriptures here you were born in sin shap in iniquity come to this world speaking lies you were a sinner before you did one thing wrong you were born in sin you were bornn the wrong way you were born with the wrong birth you're going to have to be born again so the poles of your heart resisted God it turned God away it pushed away the things of righteousness and it was attracted on the other side toward sin so you teach a child nothing just raise him up by the hair of his head so do to speak you'll turn out wrong every time right why because you parents are to be like the law of school Master to keep them until Christ comes you see all the training and the upbringing that we do for young people and it's good and it's valuable and it's tutoring it's teaching but it won't save them am man it may train them up in the way they should go it may aim them in the right direction but their heart will always be pulled toward evil the first rock and roll song the verse the verse sins or fornication or whatever were pulled in the wrong direction so every one of you were born with your compass set on hell but you see God had a plan for you and that plan was not to leave you in condition he he when he finds you he don't leave you the way he found you but he comes to turn the heart so the heart that once resisted God now it's pulled toward God I want God I want his word I want his truth I want to be righteous I want to be holy I want to do what God Said and you push away evil because the gospel said the work is to do a work in the heart to turn the heart the heart is Stony I'm going to give you a heart that's pliable that's workable that I can work with you're resistant and I'm going to I'm going to change you back where the heart had become Stony with sin I'm going to change you back and I'm going to have give you a new heart I'm going to give you a desire to do right amen it it's a it's a work of Grace amen it's a work of Grace keep that scripture up please and and he says I'll give you a a new heart and I'll give you a new spirit I'll give you a whole new attitude amen you you're you're going to think different you're I'm going to take the Stony heart out of you I'm going to do a heart transplant oh we we think some of the scientists in this day did the first one no God's been doing it a long time amen I'll give you a new heart I'm going to place in you new thinking now the word of God will be reasonable to you instead of faring in distance and pushed away now it'll be something huh that makes sense oh I see that's right now listen God ain't through with you amen but this is some a problem that many people come down to and they just get that far of just having well I want to do right you know I I I'll make an effort I'll try and then they fail because as I'm speaking this morning only God can move a mountain and the mountain in every person's life is sin that is the obstacle that you're going to have to overcome because you see you cannot go in the presence of God and remain sinful this is why to begin with When sin entered in God slew a lamb and and wrapped him in sheep's clothing or animal skins right amen why because without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin but you see the blood of an animal would never be worth the the the life of a man so it would have to be offered continually continually continually continually over and over and over and over again until millions of animals would die in the stad of man but yet it only rolled it ahead to a place called to to a time where it would be dealt with when when Jesus would come and empty out paradise those who were waiting for the blood to come the real blood so now he said I'll give you a new heart a new spirit will I put within you I take out the Stony heart give you a heart of Flesh give me the next verse and here's very important I will put my spirit this is not a new thinking this is not a better attitude this is not a good heart this is a his Spirit notice my spirit I will put in you and where you couldn't live it before Hallelujah let me tell you right now only Christ can live the Christian Life I can't do it you can't do it nobody else can do it only Christ can live the Christian Life only Christ and you can try with all you want to and you can join churches and you can you can be a member and you can say your rosaries or you can do whatever of works you want to do nothing will appease the Judgment of God because you're still unrighteous you can't live it I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling young people this morning you cannot live this gospel apart from the spirit you can try you can sign pledges with we can give you classes on what to do and what not to do and the dangers and the hurts and the scars but nothing all the psychology in the world will not change you it will not Empower you so he says I will put my spirit within you and will what's now cause you no longer are you doing it amen it's not like a peacock or a blackbird rather putting peacock feathers in and say look now I'm a peacock he's not a peacock he's just a black bird with peacock feathers he's tried to better himself look prettier how many people do that that is a mistake that so many make in religion I well I'm going to be good I'll take the neighbors case of sweet potatoes I'll be nice to the this all of those are good things and things that you should do to to others to other human beings but but that that still isn't it remember because Jesus or Paul said it in 1 Corinthians you can lack the you can have actually lack the very basic element of the Holy Spirit which is love which is the basic nature of God CU God is love and he said without charity he said you can give all your goods to feed the poor and yet not even how the basic fundamental foundational thing that God is for God is love so he says I'll put my spirit within you and I will cause you to walk in my statues and you shall keep my judgments and do them isn't this amazing here he was speaking about a new birth here he was speaking about what would happen with the coming of That Power from on high amen here's what it would do it would wash you with clean water it would be the word to purify you it will be him putting a new spirit a new heart in you but more importantly and most importantly is put my spirit in you to enable you to do what you couldn't do on your own now as we're looking at this I want just to go also to to another for he would say in Isaiah 2811 and this is also referred to by the Apostle Paul as as he speaks about the the the gifts of the Spirit within the church he actually refers to this and and he says in verse 11 for with stamin lips and other tongues will he speak to his people to whom he said this is the rest wherein you will may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing so again here again you see here with with Israel uh there the Jewish people gathered at there at the on the day of Pentecost Peter's preaching he could have very well referred to this scripture for with ston lips and other tongues will I speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith you may call the weary to rest this is the refreshing oh my when we speak of that and it being the Holy Spirit friend the the holy spirit is our rest oh yes I know he said you know honor the Sabbath day and keep it holy and many people do that and it's there's nothing wrong with resting or whatever else or having a day of rest we come as Christians like this morning because we as Christians we honor the resurrection he rose on the first day of the week so that's why we assemble together today because we are gathering here remembering his resurrection and also we would find the apostles would do the same on the first day of the week but for the Jews they were given a day again they had literal Lambs they had literal sacrifices they had literal you know everything was literally literal literal literal so a literal Sabbath and remember if you fail to keep that Sabbath you would be slain in as much to pick up a stick on that day to do anything amen that would actually crucify Jesus because he healed on the Sabbath this would be one of their reasons that the Judgment of God could come upon him and they could unleash the Vengeance that was in their hearts but notice again you see again we have a Sabbath and our Sabbath is not a literal day our lital our Sabbath is this rest when the Holy Spirit comes you enter into your Sabbath which is the rest where that you who are Laden and labored in sin can come and rest from your labors no longer are you a slave for to sin no longer are you bound oh think about this grace of almighty God so when we look and we consider these scriptures we consider even Acts chapter 2 of the descending of the spirit from Heaven yet it was not it was not Spirit only but Peter made it clear it's also the Covenant it's the book amen it's the word it's the doctrine of truth because truth itself is spirit amen the words that I speak Jesus said are spirit and Truth amen so it is so it is even called in the Bible the Holy Ghost when he the spirit of Truth is come so on the on the day of Pentecost there it was it was more than a motion being poured out though they got emotional amen though they were speaking in languages and they heard them from all various languages what were they doing what was they saying they were praising pring God it was a yes they had been filled with God's spirit and they had been drunk on the new wine and it was just overflowing out of their lives and they were praising God and giving honor to him worshiping him so yeah there was emotion in it but it wasn't emotion it was the spirit descending and when when it descended Peter says this is scripture this is word this is prophecy coming down this is that which the prophet Joel spoke of and the Book of the Covenant was open to them and a a New and Living Way hallelujah amen you see it was no longer close to them you see John the Baptist had come preaching a very strange Doctrine to their ears he was preaching about a lamb coming and they had had hundreds if not thousands of maybe Millions by now of lambs but John says there's a lamb coming that is going to take away the sin of the world and he said it's a person and I'll know him when I see him because it'll be the one that the spirit ascends and the descends upon and abides so now out of the descending of the spirit in Acts two here would it was the word coming it was not closed now understanding Enlightenment of what God had his plan you know was being made known so so again um instead of a woolly lamb they now understood that it was the Lamb of God the real lamb that all these others only prophesied of because they were speaking of but now the real blood a blood that would take away the sins of the world not just sins in that day but sins passed Those Old Testament saints that were collected into a place called Paradise where they were waiting in Abraham's bosom in other words Abraham's promise and they're waiting there until the Redeemer come Hallelujah but that day on Calvary their sins were paid in full amen the things they could not keep of the law were now paid in full and now they were perfect before God and resurrected the Bible said in Matthew chapter 28 they rose with him many of the saints that slept Rose when he raised you see Jesus resurrection wasn't only for himself but all of those from the Old Testament now soever promise contained in the scripture or yeah in the scripture was contained or encapsulated in the spirit descending it was God the word God the spirit it was the Holy Ghost coming down now out of the descending of the spirit in Acts chapter 2 came the Apostle Paul this was a direct result of the descending of the Holy Spirit was men like Paul now Paul would be the first messenger of the age he would write he would write the the majority of our new testament it would be him that would separate law from grace and it and all of this came because of the outpouring of the spirit word on the day of Pentecost now so the descending of the spirit in Acts two here came the Apostle Paul the prophet of the age who being filled with the spirit began to explore the riches of the Covenant the Bible said he explained it I believe it's in Galatians 1 where he explains it where he says you know I didn't confer with any man I didn't even confer with the apostles I went to the desert for 3 years over into Arabia and there I studied the scripture and it was revealed to me now Paul would take then the Old Testament uh things that were there that God would do for a reason for a type and whatever such as the priesthood and and um the blood and the blood offering and all of the he would explain it to the Hebrew people he would tell them it's no longer blood of bulls and goats it will not take away sin you remember this the day that Jesus died animal blood would no longer a town for sin it may have worked when when Abraham drug his lamb up it may have worked when Abel offered it the first time it it worked in other time but it would not work as a bleach it only worked as a covering so it would be like sin and then a stain of a shirt and over it at a paint now God can't see it but there it's just there's a stain there that's been covered over with something it's out of sight but it's still there that was a problem with the Old Testament the old nature and it's the thing that made them do it was still there now out of the descending of the spirit in Acts 2 came the Apostle Paul and he began to explore the riches of the Covenant he shared the details of the book of The Inheritance that was brought down on the day of Pentecost now again I I want you to see when the spirit descended it was the Covenant descending Peter said this is that now so when it did when Paul as Paul poured over the book of the Covenant he revealed or told us of the mystery truths of the Bible so now he would write about the godhead he would write about water baptism he would write about the baptism of the Holy Ghost he would write about predestination that we were we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that our our our origin did not begin with our natural birth but it was there in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and therefore you're part of Eternity hallelujah amen you can say as Jesus said I came from God his thoughts his thinking his attributes and I'm going back to God I am here on this Earth from heaven therefore I am not just a citizen of this world I'm a citizen of Heaven therefore I look and I act and I dress like the place I am from hallelujah amen oh yeah he would preach of election he would preach of marriage and divorce he would preach a of of the priesthood and and and and you know Jesus Jesus did not qualify not be being that he was not a levite but of the tribe of Judah in his Earthly lineage he would be of the tribe of Juda he would call be called The Lion of Judah he come through the king Lon and the King could not offer sacrifices a priest had to come from Levi the tribe of Levi a king had to come from the lineage of Judah to mix them you remember a king tried to do that one day and offered incense on the Altar and they told him don't do it and leprosy struck him because why he mixed the offices him being from Judah had no right to the priesthood so how did Jesus have it because Jesus did not come in the lineage of Aaron Jesus came in the order of MDC amen who was without mother without father without of days or ending of Life whoever he was he's still here he's Eternal it was God come on church amen so he came from the lineage of of MDC who was Priest he was king of Salem priest of the most high God so therefore as MDC he could be both priest and King hallelujah hallelujah Hal hallelujah amen when I think of there in in Revelation chap 5 and I think of of what was happening there when um John saw the book that was closed and sealed up with Seven Seals and no man was worthy a search was made Abraham wasn't worthy Noah wasn't worthy Enoch wasn't worthy Elijah the great prophet was not worthy no man was worthy to take the book it was the Covenant man had lost it it was sealed up now with Seven Seals now then what about it no man was worthy to even look on it did you notice in Revelation 10 that John is told not just to look on it but to take it so in Revelation 5 there was the there was the book and no man was worthy and John began to weep because he says if we don't find a worthy man remember it wasn't God that lost the book it was man that lost the title to the Earth and to The Inheritance to the Covenant and it went back in the hands of God again waiting until a Worthy man could come amen and none of them was worthy and N nothing of the law could make them worthy and the blood of bulls and goats couldn't so God when you couldn't go up into heaven God came down to earth hallelujah amen oh Hallelujah when you couldn't have sin there he came down here to make a way for you to go there that's why he could say I am the way I am the truth and I am the life and no one can come to the father except by me because he would be the worthy one as the kinsman redeemer with the wealth to pay for it no other man had the wealth man couldn't pay for his own sins we were we owed a debt we could not pay and then He Paid a Debt he did not owe what a wonderful savior what an almighty God what a loving father that God would wrap himself in Earth and walk among men and even experience the temptation of sin which he could not do as God cuz God cannot be tempted but in becoming a man he could bear our sorrows this is what makes him such a high priest this is why it makes him such an advocate is because he can say I know how you feel no longer was he a distant God there just invisible out there but God became visible the Bible said great is the mystery of godliness 1 Timothy 3:16 put it up for me 1 Timothy 3:16 where he said great is the mystery of godliness think of this without controversy great as a mystery of Godless God was manifested in the flesh Hallelujah justified in the spirit seen of angels preached to the Gentiles believed on the world and received up in the Glory Hallelujah this is why when John starts out talking about him he don't go to some Earthly genealogy but no that eagle Prophet e with eagle eyes he looks Way Beyond of Joseph and a Mary and looks Way Beyond human lineage and he goes in he says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace favor and Truth again God would come down there to take to redeem man going back to Revelation 5 now in our thinking so there is John weeping no man's worthy no one if the if the book isn't taken all creation is lost it's all for nothing and there's a strong angel that cries out and said who is worthy to take the book in Luke and loose the seal so it was looking for a worthy man and and John begins to weep because no man was found search was made through all through the Earth no man was found said weep not John for the lion of the tribe of Judah ha prevailed think about what we're saying now the lion of the tribe of Judah the King has prevailed sir amen now look the king you don't want to face his wrath you don't want to F you know people want Justice you don't want God's justice you want God's mercy you want God's pardon you want his forgiveness you don't want Justice if we got what we deserve we'd go to hell so he turns and hears that there's the lion of the tribe of Judah the king he's prevailed to take the book and loose the seals and he says and I turn to see the lion and there stood a lamb Hallelujah I stood I saw a lamb there when I saw him I didn't see a judge who would condemn me I saw a lamb who would redeem me this is why he had to be MDC because he's priest and King notice as we look at this for a moment and we look into the the the symbology of this today I want you to consider as as we look at the word coming down the spirit on the day of Pentecost as I said it's the word of Joel 2 coming down it's the word of Ezekiel 36:26 it's the word of Isaiah 2819 coming down it's the book of the Covenant encapsulated in the spirit and of the mystery truth Paul and those who were born of the spirit of his age lacked nothing in so much and Paul said if you come with something else and John would say in his book of Revelation to add to this to brings a new doctrine to present a new Jesus to come with something different he's under a double curse so you see they lacked nothing but what they didn't have was us let that sink in for a moment they lack nothing of the mystery truths but but what they didn't have was [Music] us you see without us they are not complete you see there were more names in the book so he could look the book represents the Believers that's who you are amen and and and again that's what salvation is salvation is really recognizing your name in the book and it isn't put on at the altar it was put on when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world you were identified with him and in him therefore you're not a temporal being you are an eternal being but you have discovered by salvation who your real father is and the real source of your life and where you came from and where you're going so you're really not even saved at an altar that's when you recognize what Jesus did for you your name isn't put on the role when you come to the altar your name was there before the foundation of the world let me give let me give you a couple of scripture Revelation 138 put that up for me Revelation 138 watch he talking about the the the the Beast and all will be worshiped and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him the Beast whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world all right give me 17 and8 the Beast that th saw was and is not shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit shall go into predition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life somebody read the rest of this with me from the foundation of the world so your names were written before the world began God knew you were [Applause] coming you're no accident he knew every child of his somebody said to me brother Tim I don't believe I don't believe that that in hell I said well why not he said I don't believe that God would burn his own children in hell I said I don't either I said hell was created for the devil and his angels not one of his children will be in hell that why Jesus came he came Because of You Hallelujah you needed God you needed a savior and he needed you because you were in his family album before the world began Hallelujah when God made his book up in his mind before the foundational world he knew you were coming he'll not have to set an extra plate in heaven he won't have to scr up another robe he won't hunt up another Crown he knew you were coming and he said I go to prepare a place for you so that where I am there you may be [Applause] also and God was so determined you wouldn't go to hell that he went there for you and he defeated death Hell In The Grave come on church he preached to the spirits that were in prison according to the into the the the Bible in second Peter come on Amen there and he rose there and when he rose the Saints rose with him for he by his blood had cleared the deed of the Old Testament the book was open and cleared he cleared it so much the Old Testament Saints Rose from the grave and were glorified because of this and because of this they could go in the presence of God now on the day of Pentecost Jesus Through the descending of his Spirit sent back the abstract or the cleared deed to the living now these new testament Saints that were there and and and don't miss my point there I I I maybe I brushed over it let me go back again and listen close on the day of Pentecost Jesus Through the descending of his Spirit sent back the abstract or clear deed to the living now he had already cleared it for the Old Testament but he's got to do something for the living amen and these new testament people there on the day of Pentecost were receiving a cleared deed I'm pouring out my spirit upon All Flesh because I have cleared their deeds I have removed their sins from them and now wonders of Wonders I'm not just anointing men and women I'm coming and dwelling in them and in do this your deed of all your past had to be cleansed and only one blood can do it only one thing can do it Church joining Church attendance good works none of it will do it now these new New Testament Saints would have been raptured but they ran out of time before the last name could be manifested upon the Earth again all they lacked was us and I speak of us as the last age CU I believe we're living in the last days so all they lack was us you said well how come well because unlike receiving the spirit you can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost on one day I receive it on another I may have received it 50 years ago you might have received it last week everyone receives that individually it's not collectively we don't all get it at once right so but the Rapture is a Collective event and none of us can Rapture without the other amen so you see which is so unlike our own personal experience you know because I receive the Holy Ghost one day you receive your experience another but the rapture we must all go together so like the early Saints we are waiting also I'm trying to tell you something if God is bringing a restoration in this day and restored mystery truths to us that Paul taught then all we're waiting on is the last one the last one name to that's in the book to be manifested on the earth remember as I said God wanted more than just a creation God wanted a family he wanted Sons and Daughters this is why Jesus come to be the head the first the first born of many Brethren or the first of the new race that all others would come from him notice now as we're as we're looking at this you know and and so God had a family album that he in his mind he through your name and I want to say he took a picture of you when you were at your best Hallelujah my goodness you think man I my best when I was 19 when I was 18 I I tell you when I when I was this I when I when I got when I was 25 when I reached 30 I was my best and I got to tell you you have never yet been your best but he took a picture of you of your best without defilement come on not marred by sin a body that never smoked never drank never fornicated never committed adultery come on a body that matches the soul within you he took a picture of you at your best Hallelujah and one day one day you're going to step into your bestie Hallelujah you're going to step into your theophany you and the thought that God had his word before the foundational world will become one and we shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye every blemish gone no blemish no stain no remembrance of sin with a body like his own glorious body how wonderful is that so we're waiting for the last one's name to be manifested on the Earth and some of them can take a long time even for a predestine seed to find out who they are they'll go through life a long time some of them might be 90 years old and they figur it out really they never figure it out God reveals it to him when the when he sends a spirit of adoption into your heart you cry ABA father or you recognize God is your father that is the spirit of adoption by receiving the Holy Ghost so so again Revelation 102 is the descending of Christ but it is in spirit form now we're going back to the Book of Revelation that we read about in in chapter 10 and so it's the descendant of Christ I saw another Mighty angel now why in the world is the Angel why an angel I thought I thought you were saying is Christ I I I I thought you were saying it it's the theophonic Christ there well you remember in the first Exodus there was a pillar of fire in a bush and the bush didn't burn and and Moses draws near and he says he said there was the angel Lord was in the bush and then it said God spoke out of the Bush and he said I am that I am yes and I'm sending you down to Egypt for he says I've heard the Cry of my children and I am come down to deliver so now when you compare that with that and knowing that we're in another Exodus or Rapture AG then you know that Christ must descend yes yes yes yes yes we are not in any way doing away with the literal physical coming of Jesus Christ we are not in any way uh uh saying there will be no meeting in the air where we meet the literal Lord Jesus in physical form that's not what we're saying we're saying here that just as he came down in in Exodus 3 just as he came down on the day of Pentecost it was not another God the same God in Revelation 10 he comes down as the messenger of his own Covenant angel means messenger and he comes and and he's coming in his full Glory I mean there there's you know the Song of Solomon said you know he's hiding behind the lattice and this is the way you know I see him but he you know I I I can't get a clear picture of him this is the way it's been down through the Bible they would see him but they wouldn't get a complete picture of him they were looking through tights and shadows they didn't mean understand what they were seeing come on when Abel drug up his lamb to be sacrificed he wasn't realizing there was coming a real lamb one day and he was only prophesying of this event come on when Abraham would take and put the wood on his son and go up to up Mount Mariah he didn't know he was prophesying that one day God God son would take The Old Rugged Cross on that same mountain and and God would provide a lamb right then God provided a lamb it was a lamb hung in a Thicket by its horns and that's exactly was the power of God held Jesus Christ there to the Cross cuz he surrendered his own will to be able to die for us so in Revelation 10 the descendant of Christ and spirit form in Acts 2 like acts two it brings the same truths that the apostles had it is not a new gospel for if we preach any other gospel than what Paul delivered we're cursed people it is not something new but however Through the Ages it had slowly been closed and sealed up as shown having Seven Seals that had kept anybody from really understanding as I would say they would look to the lattice they would probe in the book they would gather certain truths but according to Revelation 10 it wouldn't be made known to the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he began the sound then the mystery of God would be finished note the the closing of the book was not the work of Christ Jesus did not close the book on us he didn't close the truths on godhead predestination eternal security uh the the the original s he didn't close the book on that he didn't seal it away from us what was it out comes when the first seal is open something that looks like Christ but it's an impostor he's riding a white horse but it isn't Christ it's the Antichrist and as he begins and and Paul would say I fear that what happened with Eve the garden would happen to the church that she would lose her virginity I want to present you this is Bible this is this is the book of Corinthians he says I want to present you as a chased virgin but I fear that L by any means that you're going to be deceived like Eve was deceived and you get away from the Simplicity that's in Christ and you would and he said and and they would come and preach a another Jesus now I tell you what we got them full today we don't just have one Jesus we got many Jesus the Baptist made them one crafted him in their theology in their schools of learning the way they wanted him the the the Catholics made him you know you got to you got to mind your mama so you pray to her instead of me to of God so this Jesus was crafted by Catholic theologians we got all kinds of jesuses out there and if you're on a search there's 40,000 of them different denominations all claiming to be Christians but there's only one way now I want you to think of this beginning of the first age the Antichrist begin to close the truth now he would change and it would be the same writer but in the next seal it would be red because now he takes a sword and he begins to kill and now they begin to exterminate the True Believers in the age and they will kill just in Fox's book of martyrology alone 68 million and and then you know then then it would come to where even the godhead was paganized into three and The Trinity and unbiblical word was instituted and became the foundational dogma of the church and to restore this back to the way Paul taught it and the way that way the bible let me let me just tell you all the way through this is a one God Bible here oh Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord one Lord One Faith one baptism one God one father of his all you say what in the world happened brother Tim well God wanted a family and in order to do that he created a body thus become the son because he was Offspring made by Spirit God in the womb of Mary and he walked here upon the Earth in the office of sunship and then he ascended back and he sent his own Spirit back to us called the Holy Spirit not three persons one God manifested God above us God With Us and now God in us same God now then so you know here again it was all paganized and and all you know all of this mixed with paganism and other idea until even the truth of water baptism was lost that's why the Baptist came out with their teaching of of of being a baptizer because they said you're not baptized as an infant into the church you have to be of the age of accountability and realize and that you're a sinner and make a personal confession of faith and be baptized so they baptized again so they were called re-baptized because even that was was lost even immersion was lost that's right truths of the Bible became obscured on and on and on we could go now to restore this we needed the title deed book to be cleared and in order to do this a title search must be done to discover the sin debt of unbelief and satisfy the sin debt removing every false Doctrine from the deed as to open of its truth so Revelation 10 is the descendant of Christ in spirit form bringing a clear deed to us after having been closed and sealed up for Seven Ages out of that descending of Christ there in Acts two came a prophet just as Paul was to restore back um you know mystery truths and so they're saying out of that descending comes a prophet to restore back mystery truth that have been sealed and to do this it would actually take not of theologi but a prophet Galatians 1:12 let's examine it let's find out how the original gospel was given it was not given by Gia and the schools of learning Paul said I counted all of that as dung that I might win Christ but what he says in verse 12 he said Galatians 1:12 said I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ so it did not come from the Sadducees or the Pharisees can you imagine what kind of gospel we would had today if it had come from the halls of learning in that day it had to come from Jesus Christ himself he was the author of the book and he is his own interpreter so the book in Revelation 10 we see it pictured as unsealed handed to it and by eating it and taking of it it produces in us the same inward work of Acts chapter 2 m maturing us for the Harvest of the seed the book is now in our hands you know what that means that means it is Rapture time let me say it in the most simple words that I can say it as I close this morning God had a church the way he wanted it now he wants his church he had a CH he started a church the way he wanted it now he wants the church like he started it so do you know what that means that means there must be a book of Acts people on the Earth who not only talk about a gospel and it being head knowledge but it's an action of the Holy Spirit living in their lives producing an overcoming life giving you the power to overcome that's why the Holy Ghost came in Acts two and again it comes again and is final pouring out in the evening time a mature bride in the beginning a mature Bride In the End she goes in from she goes from wheat plant from seed to seed and both for Harvest Time and Alpha and Omega bride the same he had at the beginning the same he had at the end only God can move this mountain only the lamb could open the seals only Christ could revealed himself in this day so yes we must have the revelation of Christ personally to us and for you that's the new birth because when he's revealed personally to you not as a church member not as a collective group not belonging to mommy and daddy's church but when Christ is revealed personally to you that is the new birth I want you to Bow your heads with me please yes let the musicians come for an hour and a half we have labored here today just expounding on gospel truths and I want you this morning to just realize the gospel the resurrection of all the New Testament Saints is actually waiting on us this this morning maybe maybe you have not really surrendered your life to Christ maybe you have not really been Washed by the Water of the word and cleansed so that you would be a prepared vessel to be filled with the spirit maybe you have not received even a new heart or a new spirit or maybe that's as far as you come maybe you're struggling today to try to live right and you find yourself unable you say brother Tim is there hope for me I struggle with sin I struggle with pornography I struggle with with fornication adultery i i i every every lwd person I I I look in lust after I I have vices in my life of of alcohol and cigarettes and other things in there that makes my temple Unholy and God can't come and dwell with me but today I just say Lord I want to surrender my life to you to be a prepared vessel Washed by you I want you to wash me and make me clean from all my idols from all the other gods that I've served I've chased after sin unbelief I want my heart turned it's been pulled toward the world pulled toward sin and I want to invite you today to come Lord turn my heart turn my heart back to Faith would you allow him to do that in your life today wherever you are just let him do that work in you you see the old man the old carnal Nature has to die on The Altar with you and when you receive his sacrifice and you rise up a new a resurrection that's why we baptize we baptize unto his death his burial his resurrection that's why we immerse in water because you don't sprinkle dust on a dead man and say he's buried you immerse him these are all symbology but it's representing something that must happen otherwise if it doesn't happen in the inward work you go down a dry Center and come up a wet one but will you let the Lord change you today listen at the first Pentecost God took and wrote his law in stone as I said 3,000 died because it was the law of death because immediately man's heart was not turned just by receiving a law they began to worship other gods immediately but at in Acts chapter 2 when it came the spirit descended it wasn't God writing a law in stone but he was writing it in the fleshly tables of hearts in other words giving you a new nature placing the law of the spirit within you where that you could live an overcoming life this is why it is so important Pentecost is the most important thing that can happen to a man to a woman we'll find this we study this Pentecost is greater than Calvary yet without Calvary it could it never be it's greater than the resurrection but yet without the resurrection Pentecost could never happen it was greater than his Ascension but without the Ascension the spirit could never come it would be there that the the Covenant Jesus Christ like the Old Testament where that they would write the Covenant on a slain animal skin and rip the skin and two and give half to one half to other there it there in with his Ascension he sent back the other part of the Covenant and what you receive must match him [Music] perfectly there at Pentecost he wrote it in the in the law in the heart there at Pentecost instead of dying there were 3,000 added to the church because why it's the Covenant of Life today you can have your own Pentecost your own Jubilee in your life and be set free from every sin maybe you just want to raise and lift a hand to God and say God that's me today I I really want to have that freedom that you promised where I'm no longer slave to sin but I'm really yours God bless you he sees your hands as you just reach out toward him
