[0:24] Oh, I'm a traveler
[0:27] [Music]
[0:28] far from home.

[0:46] where I belong.

[0:52] Yes, there's a day.
[0:56] It's coming soon
[1:00] where the old

[1:06] And heaven's glory
[1:09] shines like the morning
[1:12] before our eyes.

[1:23] [Music]
[1:24] see Jesus.
[1:27] When we all

[1:34] no more sickness,
[1:38] no more madness,
[1:41] no more pain.
[1:43] [Music]
[1:48] When we all
[1:52] see Jesus
[1:55] face to Hey,
[2:00] [Music]
[2:13] [Applause]
[2:16] hey, hey.
[2:17] [Music]
[2:43] Then we will sing
[2:47] with angels voices.
[2:50] There will be
[2:53] a great rejoicing
[2:57] for holy, holy,
[3:00] worthy, worthy
[3:03] is the lamb.
[3:08] [Music]
[3:11] When we all
[3:14] see Jesus.
[3:17] When we all
[3:21] see Jesus.
[3:24] No more sickness.
[3:27] No more sadness.
[3:31] No more pain.
[3:33] [Music]
[3:38] When we all
[3:41] see Jesus
[3:44] face to face
[3:51] when we all
[3:55] see Jesus
[3:58] face to face.
[4:02] [Music]
